<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a "Queef Off" audio clip and a discussion of the hosts' hangovers and a broken pinball machine, likely damaged by employees after a previous show.  They promote their upcoming "O&A Whack-Off" contest.  A significant portion of the show centers on the "Naughty Nighty" photo contest, with exceptional entries from Sacramento prompting speculation about professional photography.  Danielle, a Sacramento board op, confirms the photos were taken by their webmaster, Leon, denying professional involvement.  The hosts compare these high-quality photos to less-impressive submissions from other cities like Cleveland and Buffalo.  Calls come in from Psycho Tim (Boston, heavily intoxicated and celebrating the Patriots' Super Bowl win), Preston (Vegas), and New Orleans, along with numerous others commenting on the Sacramento photos. One caller identifies a possible strobe light, and another claims a contestant is porn star Bonita the Saint.  The show also features listener "FU's," a debate about whether the show's "puke" segment was a hoax (denied by board ops and listeners), and promotion of an upcoming "Sandy Cain Cribs" segment.  A heated exchange occurs between Anthony and Frenchy, a recurring caller. Johnny Race calls in to recount his wild Super Bowl party.  The show concludes by promoting a live show from a New Orleans strip club and scheduling a Naughty Nighty photo shoot with a New Orleans contestant.

A subsequent segment starts with discussion of a video featuring "Stinky," potentially related to a conspiracy theory.  Frank calls in about Temptation, a New Orleans strip club he claims is a mix of transvestites and women. This sparks debate with other callers and the hosts, who attempt verification through "Cab Driver Ricky" in New Orleans, with comedically unhelpful results. The conversation shifts to a Super Bowl puke-eating contest audio clip, with Johnny Hardrock contradicting Frank's account of Temptation.  The hosts discuss their upcoming New Orleans strip club broadcast, focusing on nudity and camera usage.  A listener's "F.U." message details a 56-year-old pregnant woman and her older partner.  Big Mike calls in, emotionally discussing his stepfather's impregnation of his 56-year-old mother.  The hosts then recount a story from sex expert Laura Korn about a lawsuit involving stolen semen. The segment continues with calls from multiple "Gary's" (ages 12, 14, and 28), resulting in humorous banter.  Further discussion of the "Naughty Nighty" contest and the Sacramento entries occurs, alongside Carlos Mencia's appearance in studio. Mencia discusses his experiences with Comedy Central censors.

The next segment opens with Steve (Sacramento) discussing the flattering lighting in their conference room. The hosts briefly mention their upcoming one-year anniversary party and online photos.  A heavily intoxicated Psycho Tim again calls in, rambling incoherently about his Patriots victory celebration.  Carlos Mencia recounts a verbal altercation with a witty, seemingly handicapped Jack in the Box employee. This leads to a discussion about service from employees with disabilities, which segues into a discussion about race and cultural identity, filled with offensive language and stereotypes. Mencia offers a controversial opinion on immigration.  Callers react angrily to Mencia's statements.  The conversation touches upon the controversy surrounding an American flag from Ground Zero at the Winter Olympics, political correctness, and the treatment of John Walker.  A short musical interlude is included.

In the final segment featuring Carlos Mencia, the show begins with discussions of unpleasant airline passengers and a listener, Jennifer, attempting (unsuccessfully) a "queef" on air. Listener-submitted "FU" messages, mainly targeting St. Louis Rams fans and Terry Glenn, are aired.  The conversation shifts to Mencia's online cartoons, arcade games, and pinball machines. Paul (Indian) calls in to discuss stereotypes of "towel heads."  Mencia recounts a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles and the differing reactions of his white and Black friends, prompting a broader discussion on human nature and cultural differences. He exchanges words with Adam about his past with Cheech Marin and discusses Comedy Central's censorship with Samantha. Mencia elaborates on his comedic style, making highly offensive racial generalizations.  Pat challenges Mencia's comment about Black people in Ireland.  The conversation briefly touches on Michael Jordan and culminates in an anecdote about O.J. Simpson requesting to attend Mencia's show.  The segment concludes with Kid Chris's prank calls to O.J. Simpson and speculation on his guilt or innocence, ending with promotion of a hotel and Mencia's websites.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And there you have it, the first ever Queef Off!  Ah, that was great.  We've had lots of requests for that damn thing without the delay and stuff.  Yes.  And there you have it.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're live, we're not in Best Of, we just wanted to start the show with the Queef Off today.  Yeah!  It's, what, Tuesday?  It's Monday, isn't it?  I have no recollection of being here yesterday.  Well, we did a show yesterday.  We did?  My hungover friend.  I don't remember that.  God, I feel so much better today. 
[00:00:30]  Well, you're going to have to return the favor today because I got the worst allergy attack.  Oh, yeah?  Ever.  I'm very psyched.  There's other guys from Classic Pinball Outside fixing our T2 pinball machine.  Yeah, why is it broken already?  You know why?  Because there's a bunch of goddamn degenerates working here.  I don't know what it is.  During our show and after our show, we play the pinball machine.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I've got to back you up.  Yeah.  Something is wrong with us.  We're starting to call other people degenerates.  I mean in other ways.  Are we the responsible ones around this radio station these days? 
[00:01:00]  No.  Not at all.  But with our own stuff, we are.  All right.  And with something that's kind of cool.  You know, you get the pinball machine.  After the show, we start playing it.  Everything's fine and dandy.  And then I don't know what happens.  Other shows start playing it maybe.  The next day, I come in.  It was working when I left.  And I come in and broke it.  Someone broke it.  And then trying to fool me, it smelled like beer almost a little bit around it.  I'm thinking someone dumped a little bit of beer somehow.  By accident? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know, you can't put a beer up on a pinball machine.  It's tilted.  But I don't know.  And then a piece broke off from inside.  And people continued to play it until the metal piece went down into where the ball goes.  Because if the metal piece snaps off, you've pretty much got to stop playing it.  Not until the metal piece goes down into the works and shorts stuff out.  That's not good.  Mike, what's going on, man?  Good day, gentlemen.  What up with you, Toolbag?  Hello.  What are you doing?  Always.  Back to the always. 
[00:02:00]  3.15.  Starting the show.  As funny as that was, that should be on Best of a Saturday.  Shut up, Toolbag.  That was never heard in that form.  That's why we played it.  That was brand new.  Yeah.  Brand new stuff.  Besides, we were in the back office watching Britney on Oprah.  Yes, yes.  Doing some show prep.  Working out the details on our next great contest.  I don't know if it's going to be called a contest officially.  More of an exhibition.  The great O&A whack-off.  Coming to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  Details coming.  Just say details arriving.  Details arriving.  The great O&A whack-off.  Coming soon.  Yeah, we did talk a little bit about this.  That's all we're saying for now.  It's all we can say, people.  That's right.  It's all we really can say.  You will love it, though.  You will love it.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Holy Jesus. 
[00:03:00]  What am I?  God, something's going on in Sacramento.  I know.  Wait, let me get in.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead.  And for anyone else outside the New York area, including, what the hell, Sacramento, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  I believe you're talking about the latest contestant in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Anna.  There's a conspiracy going on.  I think Sacramento's playing with us a little bit.  Why are their shots so much nicer than any other city?  I'm not talking about the quality of the girl. 
[00:03:30]  I'm talking about the quality of the photograph.  The lighting is impeccable.  The lighting is perfect.  Look at this shot with the shadows and the green.  Dude, look at the tone.  She's golden.  Sacramento, I think, is messing with us.  Look at that.  That is perfect lighting.  Look at this.  What contestant is this?  The last contestant that is up on OBMethodes.com?  You can tell by the backdrop how dark and how brightly lit it is in different shots.  Look at that.  That is perfect lighting. 
[00:04:00]  There's a little bit of something on the lens just to soften it a little bit.  Dude, this chick's a contender.  Plus, the chicks are all tens.  Sacramento only has three girls in the contest, and all three could easily make the finals.  Easily make the finals.  The shot where she's sitting on that conference table and looking over her shoulder with a little...  Look at this.  Look at that.  That's a gorgeous shot.  That is like a...  She looks like Kate Hudson.  She's got a little Kate Hudson in her.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Wow.  And then the last shot, she's in a black thing, totally see-through, with luscious cans.  This contest is getting very interesting.  Yes.  Very interesting.  This is the final week to qualify, so ladies, you can come down to the studio here in New York  if you've got your naughty 90s, and we'll take your pictures.  Our camera's not as good as the one they're using in Sacramento.  Sacramento, we've got to get someone on the phone from Sacramento and see what the deal  is.  Ben, is there a possibility at all today?  Get their board op on.  Yeah, get their board op on, at least. 
[00:05:00]  Somebody.  See what's going on.  Did they just go all out and hire a professional photographer?  They might have done that.  They might have...  We weren't born yesterday.  Something is going on with those photos in Sacramento.  Because you compare those shots to the shots we're getting from Cleveland where all the  girls have the red eye.  Uh-huh.  It's a drastic difference.  Dude, I will say this one thing.  Their program director, Steve Garland, is motivated like Tim Sabian motivated.  Steve Garland, is crazy, so it wouldn't surprise me if he got like a real serious photographer. 
[00:05:30]  Well, there's a lot of pride at stake here.  You know, every day, every day when I log on to this site, it's such a great thing.  You click on one of the links that aren't highlighted like you looked at it already.  You scroll down and go, oh, there's new girls.  New girls.  New girls.  And then I click on something like Anna here, number 72 from Sacramento.  And, uh, wow.  Another, another, uh, top five right there.  Yeah.  She's in my top five.  Well, here's the deal.  Uh, the last week to qualify, like we're saying, uh, our goal is to get a hundred girls in this 
[00:06:00]  contest.  We're up to 72.  72.  We'll do it.  So we need to push hard the last few days here.  A hundred chicks.  A hundred chicks in the Naughty Nighty contest would really, really rock.  How cool is that?  Sean from Boston on the Instant Feedback.  WBCN went from coverage of the Super Bowl champions.  Uh, parade through Boston straight into the queef off.  Truly a magical afternoon in Boston.  Yes.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  How funny is that?  We were probably.  We got a huge celebration.  We were probably broadcasting that queef off to thousands upon thousands of people as 
[00:06:30]  they're standing in the cold.  Great.  There you go.  Hello, Boston.  Hope you like the queef off.  Yeah, they're out of their minds up in Boston.  I heard they were drinking at 10 o'clock this morning.  Who was in the bar?  Drinking.  They haven't.  Psycho Tim.  They haven't stopped since Sunday.  I think he's checking in as you said his name, man.  Uh, Chris, what's going on?  Chris.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, Vegas.  What's up?  What's up, Chris?  No, it's Preston.  Yeah, well, whatever.  Preston.  I was looking at Raw last night and they had one of your signs up there. 
[00:07:00]  When you're wow stickers.  Where are you?  We're doing quite well with the, uh, with the wow on, uh, live TV lately, man.  Yeah.  It was all over Raw last night.  With Stephanie announcing that she's pregnant.  She's pregnant.  What kind of story line is this?  The acting was classic.  Well, let's see how long that pretty she lasts on there.  Did anyone tape, uh, Raw?  We gotta tape it every week.  Cause, get the clip of Stephanie.  Do you really have it, Rick?  Get the clip of Stephanie telling Triple H she's pregnant. 
[00:07:30]  The acting is hilarious.  Is she gonna win some kind of an award for acting these days?  Most likely.  Has she advanced from when she was chained to the boiler room?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Doing much better.  Her boobs are ridiculous looking, though.  Well, she's pregnant.  Perhaps they're just getting bigger to feed the child.  They're ridiculously big.  And she should never lounge backwards like this.  Let them fall a little bit.  They're ridiculous looking.  And then there's a clip of, uh, Vince McMahon going, liar. 
[00:08:00]  I'm gonna be a grandpa.  Liar.  You're a liar.  Am I still on the air?  Uh, yeah, Preston.  That's what we do.  Oh, okay.  I know, I know.  We go off on weird little tangents.  But, yeah, we saw the WOW representation at Raw last night.  And we couldn't be prouder with the people in Vegas.  Yeah, Vegas.  There's a douchebag show out there that stole the WOW thing and thought they were gonna get away with it.  But, oh, surprise, we got syndicated to Vegas, douchebags.  We saw that happening.  Well, listen, you guys have a nice day. 
[00:08:30]  All right, thanks, Preston.  All right, no problem, man.  Take it easy.  All right.  All right.  Preston.  Yes, Preston.  And the other name is Preston.  Stuck up rich kid.  Yeah, but Preston was also the fat kid from Jack Ash that they really abused.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I don't think the name Preston's cool at all.  Preston.  And she stepped on the ball.  The other thing that happened on Raw last night?  Yeah.  They showed Hulk Hogan's mug for the first time, I believe.  Yeah, yeah.  They're bringing the Hulkster back.  As part of the NWO. 
[00:09:00]  NWO.  He's not gonna be the Hulkster where, you know, he tells kids to eat their veggies and take their vitamins.  He's gonna be the Tough Hulk with the, you know, with the Miami Vice beard and stuff.  Hollywood Hogan.  Hollywood Hogan.  Hollywood Hogan.  How does he walk around?  How is he gonna walk around the various arenas and whatnot knowing that everyone goofed on him?  With a cane.  At some point or another.  Yeah, with a cane.  Doing his leg drop.  They, they, everyone goofed on him.  Everyone, they, they'd play the music.  They'd sing the songs.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  Where they were doing, they were goofing on Hulk. 
[00:09:30]  The two old guys.  What were their names?  The Huckster.  Pat Patterson.  Yeah.  Did you ever see that?  The Huckster and the Nacho Man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, the old guys would come out and do the Hulk thing where, you know, he'd spin his hand around and put it up to his ear to listen for the applause.  How could they, I guess the money, yeah.  Hey, let's say hi to Danielle.  Danielle?  Danielle.  Danielle is the board up in Sacramento.  Danielle.  Danielle.  Hi.  Hey, Danielle.  Okay, we don't have a professional photographer.  No.  Something's going on. 
[00:10:00]  It is our webmaster, Leon.  He takes great pictures and our camera is wonderful.  The lighting is perfect, though.  That's our conference room.  And what about that, what about that one shot that looks like it's in someone's bedroom?  That's, that's part of the studio?  No, it's the conference room.  Conference room.  I'm sure they just brought in a sheet or something.  No, it's got the, um, the, uh, ceiling to floor blinds, it looks like.  Yep.  And the girl's peeking out of the blinds and, and her, she's standing on her tiptoes and 
[00:10:30]  her little nighty thing is just halfway up her ass.  What a hot shot that is.  This girl is, uh, I don't think Playboy could, uh, come up with a better shot.  Everything is perfect.  The, the pose is perfect.  The lighting's perfect.  The golden lighting.  The makeup is perfect.  Even the little shadow of the tree in the background.  Yeah.  It's number three or four.  The, the, the subject here, Anna, is perfectly in focus and the background just slightly out  of focus to show the depth.  Danielle, something's going on.  You can tell us.  No, there's absolutely nothing. 
[00:11:00]  You can tell your pals open at the end.  Where are these girls from?  They're from here in Sacramento somewhere.  Are they listening to our show, you think?  Yes, they are listeners.  They seem, they seem like ringers.  No, not at all.  Um, our photo shoots last like three and four hours.  Ah, do they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't doubt it.  The photo shoots in Buffalo last two minutes.  Just to give you the contrast.  Well, they don't want the tranquilizer to wear off before they set them free in their natural  habitat.  I'm kidding.  Three or four hours? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  My God.  All right.  Well, you guys got, you guys only have three girls representing, but all three could easily  make the final.  Yeah.  Easily.  I think Natalie is our best one so far.  Which one?  But I haven't seen Anna.  Anna's unbelievable.  Anna, yeah, check that out.  The shots of Anna are unbelievable.  All right, Danielle.  Thanks.  Tell Steve to call us.  Okay, he's in Vegas.  Try to get a hold of him and tell him to call the show today, because we want to get to  the bottom of this.  Okay.  All right.  No problem.  Thank you.  You're welcome. 
[00:12:00]  Doing a great job in Sacramento.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Natalie's okay, body-wise.  I'm not a big fan of the mug on that one.  Which one's Natalie?  Turn her around.  She's the only my own screen.  She's the first one that we thought was a fake.  Oh, she's really hot.  Yeah, her bod's hot, but I don't know.  Yeah, I like Anna.  Kind of looks like the, uh, looks like Misfire Island.  Local reference for New York.  There you go.  There you go.  Oh, man! 
[00:12:30]  Psycho Tim, live from Boston.  What about him?  We were in VCR afternoon.  This place is rocking.  You are hammered.  I am out of my mind.  I've seen about four fights.  The hell's breaking up people's heads.  A couple of Yankees are cheers.  I'm a little bit upset about it.  It's just been mayhem to fights, beer, whatever you think.  It's just not stupid.  Fights and beer.  Did anyone go to work today?  No.  It was an, like, they gave the public schools off.  I don't think they ever go to school anyways, but they, you know, had it off. 
[00:13:00]  Hold on.  That's another quote on the pay phone, because my cell phone doesn't work.  There's so many people down town.  Here we go.  All right.  Let's keep talking.  Yeah, it looked like a wild scene on TV today, man.  Above BCN's van, we're outside.  It's like me and Callie on top of the BCN Hummer.  There's some girl in an office, like, secretary, showing her boobs.  Nice.  I heard about it, so it's like, oh, yeah, by the way, there's the Patriots want to do  overhide you, but there's a girl showing her boobs right now. 
[00:13:30]  Actually, hold on.  There's a girl here with big boobs right now.  You just brought by me.  Hey, Psycho Tim.  Yeah.  Did everyone get to hear that queef-off?  I haven't heard the radio all day.  I've been talking to Nick Carter all day, and I haven't heard one thing, because it's  just so nuts.  You sound hammered.  Dude, I've been drinking since, like, 10.  Hammered.  When I was a kid, I was at a bar, and he gets up and goes, dude, what time does the game  start?  And I was like, yeah, it's so nice to be won, you know? 
[00:14:00]  That's classic.  Everybody's getting nuts.  It's like, it's nuts.  All right.  We'll check in from time to time today, right, Tim?  All right.  And congrats to everyone up there in Boston.  Yeah.  They're having a big party today.  And if we're going to go to a big breakfast, we should have went right back up to Boston  today, I'm telling you.  We should have been there.  There's guys all around.  This place is nuts, dude.  Cool.  There's a guy on top of a roof, naked today, almost fell off and died.  There was guys on scaffolding, like, you know, like, too hard for TV movies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like, get away from that thing. 
[00:14:30]  That building's going to fall down.  Guy was naked on top, right across the city hall, naked on top of a chimney.  Naked.  Boston, long, long in the making, this celebration that they're having up there.  So, and they're doing it just like they do in Boston.  Just get drunk and fight.  It's an Irish brother fighting, as you said, Anthony.  You know what I'm saying?  Of course.  I hear you.  You know, I'm hanging out with my buddy, and then if you get in, if I fight him and  you get involved, I'm going to kick the snot out of you.  That's how it goes up there.  All right, Tim.  All right, guys.  Check in a little later if anything is happening, all right? 
[00:15:00]  If I'm in jail, you mean?  Can I call you guys with, like, one phone call?  Yeah, that'd be cool.  It won't be the first time that we've done that.  All right, buddy.  All right, Tim.  There you go.  Hammered.  Hammered.  Chris, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm wondering since the Patriots won the Super Bowl if there's been an increase in sale  of boxes of wine.  I got to celebrate the Pats winning the Super Bowl, so I got to go to the liquor store 
[00:15:30]  and get a big box of wine.  I might get two boxes of wine, but I got to go to the proper liquor store because there's  one I can only get to by making left on tins, and I don't make them.  Three rights make a left.  I don't have to make left on tins.  Box of wine.  No, I've been rolled.  All right.  At the parade, at the celebration, everyone having fun, she'd go, I want to go home.  Well, no, none of the Pats came out yet. 
[00:16:00]  We're hanging.  We're having fun.  This is cool.  I want to go home.  Take me home.  Thank you.  A lot of fun.  That's very cool.  Why do they have to remind me of the horror that was four years ago?  Well, Hung, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I'm looking at the Sacramento pictures.  That's a pro.  You think so?  Yeah, you can actually see the strobe head in the last picture.  The strobe head?  Right, upper left, right-hand corner.  Okay, bastards, man.  Upper right.  In which picture?  The last?  Last one on Anna.  Last picture on Anna.  You can see a strobe? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, look up in the upper right-hand corner.  See that white thing?  That's the strobe head.  We turn around, man.  They're cheating on this contest.  They're not cheating.  I mean, if they want to take quality shots, God bless them.  Plus, she's got to be a professional.  Yeah, look at that.  It's the bowl of it, and it's pointed up.  Yeah, it's like an elliptical circle up there.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a strobe head.  Wow, they've got a professional in there taking the pictures of the girl.  I've got a ringer down here in New Orleans, but she's not a professional model. 
[00:17:00]  She's going to come by and see you guys when you're down here from Mardi Gras.  Cool.  We'll take some Naughty Nighty pictures when we're live in New Orleans.  What do you think of the job they did with Anna in Sacramento?  Me?  Yeah.  I think it's fantastic.  Yeah.  She's great.  I'm not one to criticize, but this is definitely changing the parameters.  It certainly is.  When you've got some bored-out guy, you know, hey, God bless him, but maybe he's not the  best picture taker.  He's got this cheap little digital camera. 
[00:17:30]  The pictures just aren't going to look as good as Sacramento.  My God, these things can be put in magazines.  Hell yeah.  One other observation is the plants coming in the corner of the shot.  Only a gay photographer would do that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think it's kind of a jungle motif.  That's definitely very gay.  This contest is getting very deep.  Yeah.  All right, well, Hong, thank you.  Look forward to seeing you down here.  Later, guys.  Right on, man.  Let's go to Bob, who's the board-off in Buffalo.  He's been taking the pictures of the girls in Buffalo for the Naughty Nighty contest, and 
[00:18:00]  now he's pissed off at us.  Could someone give me a number of a Buffalo contestant so I could pop it up?  Well, Bob will be able to.  We only have them.  All right.  Bob, you only have two girls in the contest, right?  Yeah, that's right.  Which ones?  Leanne's the one that I took pictures of.  All right.  Let me...  And John Paul took pictures of the first one, but I think she dropped out because she didn't  bring her ID back or something.  All right.  Let's look at...  You know something?  What is Leanne?  Number 39 or something?  In a photo album or hanging up in someone's cubicle?  Well, hopefully the listeners won't...  You know, they'll kind of...  I don't know.  You go to Sacramento. 
[00:18:30]  They're going to be influenced by the Sacramento pics.  You go to Sacramento, you're looking at pictures that you could see the first...  Like, this is the first page in Playboy before they take their clothes off totally.  And these are, like, perfectly taken pictures.  Bob, you going to get any more girls in the contest?  You only have two.  I know.  I hope so.  The girls in Buffalo...  I bang for them every day, Ope.  Now, who's the other one from Buffalo?  They can stop by today with their naughty 90s to the Buffalo station.  I can't think of the other one's name, but I think she dropped out.  So you only have one girl officially.  There's one, actually, yeah.  And she's not bad, though. 
[00:19:00]  I think she's beautiful.  I like her.  Not bad for a 20-year-old, Ope.  Oh, there you go.  Those girls weren't walking around when I was up there.  Yeah, baby.  We used to call them Buffalo Bettys when I was in town.  Buffalo Bettys.  No, there's no more Buffalo Bettys in Buffalo.  They're all nice looking now.  Oh, there you go.  You've been gone too long, Opey.  Too long, man.  That's it, baby.  They replenished the supply.  That's it, baby.  That's right, baby.  Oh, my.  Bob, do you do a radio shift?  Yes, I do.  I'm on from 10 to 3. 
[00:19:30]  I come on after your arch enemy there.  Oh, right before us.  Yep.  Right on, man.  I'm on until you come on, and then I get stuck running aboard.  You're killing 97 Rock's ass, I hope.  We're killing them.  We're kicking their asses.  Nice.  I like the voice, Bob.  97 who?  That's nice.  That's a nice set of pipes.  Hey, Bob, we do what we do because we don't have the voice like you.  Yeah.  If I had the voice like you, I would have went, you know, the regular way, man, doing the  two for Tuesdays and stuff.  What are you just, Bob, or what are you? 
[00:20:00]  I used to Godfather on the radio, baby.  Ah, Godfather.  Godfather.  That's right.  I want to say hi to everybody in Sacramento, man.  I used to live in, I was in Sacramento for 19 years, right across the street from Kayak's  away, as a matter of fact.  Look at that voice, bro.  I know.  Isn't that great?  You're our new favorite radio guy.  Well, thank you very much.  I'll call you every day.  Screw Scorch.  But hey, pump Buffalo off, Opie.  It's cold up here, baby.  You got the snow still?  Yeah, kind of.  You know, it's blowing around, but...  Have you had a lot of snow since that one blizzard? 
[00:20:30]  A little bit.  Yeah.  Not as much as, but hey, seven feet's enough, right?  There you go.  Hell yeah.  I mean, seven feet.  Oh my God, that's snow, baby.  Hey, there he is.  Bob, the Godfather.  Yeah, the Godfather.  Oh, checking out the website.  There you go.  Best concert you ever saw.  The best concert I ever saw?  The Voices of Classic Rock concert at Fort Erie Racetrack.  That's right.  They were just up here, and it was awesome.  And you know why it was so awesome?  Why?  Because they didn't have attitudes.  They were all regular guys.  Yeah, come on backstage.  Here, let's do a beer. 
[00:21:00]  Let's smoke a joint.  We had fun.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, we're kind of past that, I guess.  Nothing like that.  Oh, man, let me see your pass.  Hey, I got your pass right here.  Who was the headliner?  Actually, there was a whole bunch of what they were were lead singers from like five or six different bands.  A guy from Deep Purple was there.  Oh, there you go.  It's slipping my mind now, but they were good.  We had a great time.  Cool.  Had a great time.  And you know Fort Erie, man.  All kinds of women up there.  Hell yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Hey, Godfather, we got to go, bro. 
[00:21:30]  Up there for that Canadian ballet.  You come up here, we'll take care of you.  We'll hook you up.  I'm telling you.  I was just telling the guys in the back office about the Canadian ballet and how hot those girls are.  Unbelievable.  They are hot.  Because like in Canada, I think all the teenage girls, they can't find work, so they go to the strip clubs and eat some dough, man.  Nothing wrong with that.  I hear Anthony likes them young ones.  Hey, who doesn't there, Godfather, right?  That's right, baby.  If they're not 20 and under, I'm not interested.  All right, Godfather.  Get out of here. 
[00:22:00]  All right, baby.  All right.  There we go.  Yeah.  I like him.  What a set on him, huh?  We're updating all our characters on the Opie and Anthony show, so out with Scorch, in with the Godfather.  And then we got rid of old Dirty and we got Frenchie, so we're just revamping the whole thing.  Revamping.  Revamping, baby.  Is it true that we're going to do a new Cribs?  Stalker Patty Cribs was very successful.  Everybody could check it out on FoundryMusic.com.  Sandy Cain Cribs.  Sandy Cain Cribs, man. 
[00:22:30]  A week from today on the Opie and Anthony show.  What kind of sick house could she possibly...  Does she live in a house, an apartment where...  What does she have?  She lives in an apartment here in the city.  How does she pay a rent?  I have no idea.  She doesn't seem functional.  It's like those mongoloids that can't live on their own.  You know, and they set them out into the public and they just fail miserably.  I hopped on the bus.  They took me to the wrong place.  You're on the wrong bus.  She was talking about she wants to get a new bed before we come over with the film crew.  Why?  Because I guess she has one of those beds that pull out of the wall. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I think she's got one of those.  Again, I just picture the red neon hotel sign blinking out a window.  The L train two feet away from our wall.  Where is she?  By old 42nd Street?  Right down there?  Near that area, yeah.  She probably hasn't moved in years.  She's probably been there forever.  She used to be able to roll out of bed, roll her mouth onto something, roll back into bed.  Yeah.  Well, I can't wait for that.  That'll be a week from today.  And also, we just discussed it down the hall, the great O&A whack-off coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Can't give too many details on this contest.  Oh, no.  I don't even think anyone's going to be able to guess what the hell this is all about.  And it's not a sperm count contest or anything like that.  Let's just put it this way.  And, you know, the name itself sounds pretty gay.  Yeah.  The great O&A whack-off.  Yeah.  Trust me, you'll love it.  Oh, sure.  You'll absolutely love it.  All right?  Right.  Finally, finally, finally, the ultimate degenerates meet the ultimate decadence. 
[00:24:00]  This Friday, the O.P. and Anthony show broadcasts live from Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  And E.W.  Here, check it out, the O.P. and Anthony show.  Lots going on today.  By the way, we should tell the fine people in.  Carlos Mencia on the show today.  Yes.  People love Carlos.  He's coming into town to, I think he's taping something for Comedy Central. 
[00:24:30]  Carlos.  So he'll be in in, I think, minutes.  I think he's going to be in around 4 o'clock or so.  And for a lot of controversy over the girls representing Sacramento in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Why is there controversy?  Of course, this is the last week to qualify.  We've got a fine lady outside the studio that's going to be representing New York.  She's getting her pictures taken.  Are they working the lighting out there?  Is Rick now going to start doing lighting?  Oh, we've got to keep up with Sacramento, eh?  Well, Rick by far had the best pictures. 
[00:25:00]  Photographically speaking, not the contestants.  But now it's Sacramento using the lighting techniques.  And Rick, it's just not, your photos don't have the professional look.  You get a good sleaze factor.  You'd be good for Hustler or Swank.  Our goal is to get 100 girls, by the way, Ant, in the contest.  We're up to 72 and counting.  72 and counting.  But there's more controversy now, Ant.  Oh, what now?  Someone from Sacramento on the line. 
[00:25:30]  Chris?  Chris, what's going on?  Hi, it's Chris from Cleveland.  Oh, Cleveland.  What's up, Chris?  The one chick from Sacramento, she's a porn star, man.  Which one?  They're getting porn stars?  Check her out.  I can't remember which one.  But she's got that little white heart tattooed right above her bikini line.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was...  Which one?  I think that was the first...  No, that wasn't her.  Damn it.  Someone help us out a number.  Ben, go down.  Go down.  Come on, there's only two of them, guys.  Three. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, but they don't have them labeled by city, which sucks.  Oh, man.  I thought you guys were going to get on that.  Go to Christie.  Number 70.  No, that's Washington.  That's Washington.  Crap.  Yeah, we've got to put the cities.  And have you seen her porn, though?  No, you can tell...  Have you ever seen a chick with that tattoo not in a porn?  Oh, I thought you knew for sure that she was a porn star.  Dude, check her out.  We've had girls come in with that.  They just kind of...  Yeah.  They just put a little heart when they go into the tanning booth. 
[00:26:30]  Whatever.  Oh, dude, I thought you had a scoop for us.  All right, I've got something else for you.  Because Morgan has that.  I've got a new bit.  What's the new bit?  What did I learn yesterday?  All right, go ahead.  What I learned yesterday is after getting all horned up listening to the sex lady,  don't surprise your girl by asking her to snowball.  It ain't cool.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Someone is now saying they know the name of the porn star.  Anthony, what's up? 
[00:27:00]  Yo, what's up, all night?  Yeah, the porn star's name is Bonita the Saint.  I thought it was her from looking at that heart thing, but it's not her.  Oh, it's not her?  By this time, Bonita the Saint's probably got to be ancient and, like, worn down.  All right.  So it's a bit hard put up west.  She just looks like an old porn star.  Yeah, well, it's just that heart thing.  I mean, she looks nothing like the real Bonita Saint, but that's the one he was referring to.  Here she is right here.  Uh, okay.  So it's definitely not her, right?  No, it looks nothing like her, but, I mean, the guy... 
[00:27:30]  Hey, we find out they're using porn stars.  We're taking them out of the contest.  What number?  The city will be disqualified from the Naughty Nighting contest.  She's beautiful, though, man.  Yeah, but that's not the porn star, but it's Bonita Saint.  So while you're looking to download some internet porn, she's pretty smokin' back in the day.  Oh, that heart thing.  All right, cool.  Yeah.  We got the number.  What number?  69.  69.  She's the one in the second-to-last picture, looks like Scully.  She looks like Scully from the X-Files in the second-to-last picture.  With darker hair, right? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to 12-year-old Gary.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Gary?  Lil' Gary.  I'm not going to be able to make it today.  Yeah, you were supposed to come in today, huh?  I'm going to come in tomorrow.  Why?  My dad's in Mount Vernon, and he's not going to be able to get back in time.  Well, tomorrow's a good day, because we got Brewer coming in.  Yes!  Adam Ferrara.  Lil'la!  Lenny Clark.  Damn, it's a good day.  It's going to be a good day tomorrow.  Girls wowing for the 12-year-old.  Uh-huh. 
[00:28:30]  All right, Gary.  We have no clue.  That's not cool.  We've never seen Gary at all.  We have no clue what Gary looks like.  Are you a little fat kid?  No.  How tall are you, Gary?  About, like, five-ish.  Five foot?  Five-ish.  Let me say that.  And how much do you weigh?  One.  Five foot, 100 pounds?  Let me get my chart out.  Oh, I'm just kidding.  No.  I'm just kidding.  Are you husky?  Yeah, I'm a little husky.  You're a little husky?  Five foot, 100 pounds?  That's not husky, is it? 
[00:29:00]  I guess it could be.  All right, we'll check you out tomorrow there, Gary.  All right.  You bringing us anything?  Uh, I'll bring you a cake to Sam Adams.  Well, we got plenty of that.  We could put it right on top of the other beer.  All right.  Yeah, we'll have the 12-year-old buy us beer.  We'll accept the case from 12-year-old Gary.  Thank you.  All right, Gary.  We'll see you tomorrow.  All right, guys.  See you.  Bye.  Because, you know, you have a little image conjured up in your head because of his voice  and attitude, what he might look like.  Right.  And he comes in and looks like a little roly-poly nerdy kid. 
[00:29:30]  It's going to be a little weird.  They'll be fine.  Doug from Springfield, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I'm sick and tired of that French-fried faggot making fun of people on the phone.  I'm going to tell him right now I'm going to challenge him to a boxing match inside the studio.  They don't.  He doesn't fight.  If he wants to be a big shot, let him accept the challenge.  The French don't fight.  The French don't fight.  Big French faggot.  They proved it in World War II.  He's good hiding behind his phone.  Yes.  That's what makes it such a great bit. 
[00:30:00]  Like Old Dirty said he was stopping by today to punch him in the nose.  Frenchy is nowhere to be seen.  We'll see.  If he wants to accept the challenge, I'll listen to the radio.  That's what's great about this bit.  He's hiding.  Big French faggot.  Is he married?  Dougie drives you nuts, doesn't he?  Is he married?  I think so.  His wife's a lesbian because she married a bitch.  Wow.  Just tell him that.  I'll talk to you guys later.  All right, Doug.  I'm sure Frenchy will be calling any moment.  Oh, sure.  Oh, he's off the phone now, so there's really no reason to. 
[00:30:30]  We don't want to burn out that character.  The Frenchy character.  Speaking of burnt out characters, annoying laugh Anthony, check it in.  Very funny.  What's up, bro?  I got a problem with Frenchy, too.  Why?  Because he's taking your spotlight.  Does he rip you?  No, he's not.  Because he rips you an ass?  He's taking your spotlight.  He's taking Old Dirty's spotlight.  He's taking Doug from Springfield's spotlight.  There he is.  There he is.  What's your problem with Frenchy?  Oh, my God.  He doesn't have anything nice to say to me, son.  Well. 
[00:31:00]  He doesn't even know me.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, Frenchy.  Where's that faggot on the phone?  Frenchy, fatso, you suck.  You're the worst.  Shut up, man.  You fat bastard.  You suck, Steve.  You loser.  You douchebag.  You douchebag.  You stupid.  Where are you from, anyway?  I'll see you in the studio, Frenchy, because the next time you're there, I'm there.  Where are you from, man?  From Staten Island?  From the dump?  Next time, next time, next time you're up there.  Go in garbage.  Frenchy, it's Limo Anthony.  It's Limo Ant. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, it's Limo Anthony.  Well, go back to Staten Island in the dump.  You suck.  You fat bastard.  You fat faggot.  Make spaghetti.  Listen, fat faggot.  When you come into the studio, I'll be right behind you.  Hey, meet the ball.  Shut up.  You're mine.  You're mine.  Yeah, you will meet the ball.  That's what you are.  You're going to be my bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to put you over my lap, and I'm going to F you with my hand, you douchebag.  You fat faggot.  I'll be up in the studio.  You suck.  You lose it.  You know what you look like?  You look like a big balloon.  Bring nothing to the show. 
[00:32:00]  A big balloon with hair on it.  A big balloon.  A big balloon with hair on it.  Just like the carpet that you have going on your back, you fat faggot.  When I'm there, if they'll let me in, I'll come in.  You're just like a big fat faggot.  You fat faggot.  Just hide in your stupid car.  Actually, it's not even a car.  It's an effing bus.  I will see you.  It'll be mine.  You drive around in a garbage truck, you F-4.  If they'll let me up.  You douchebag.  Anthony, why would you do this to yourself, buddy? 
[00:32:30]  You can't go against Frenchy.  You can't clean, my friend.  You can't clean.  Christ almighty, what does he bring to the show?  He comes in there, cooks rats, and you guys love them.  And you go there to cry.  I get cooked rats.  You go there to cry for attention, you F-4.  I don't need any attention, bro.  Just a big, fat loser.  I go in there because they make me laugh.  You're a fat loser.  I'll see you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, you're a fat Italian loser.  You got it.  You French.  Yeah, why don't you go back there with a little bottle of champagne.  You stumped.  You lose.  Make friend again.  Frenchy has a lot of heat. 
[00:33:00]  Frenchy has a lot of heat, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'll see you soon.  All right.  That's what you see, my friend.  That's what you see.  Do it back.  No, I mean, it sucks, man.  You just go there crying over everything.  Oh, can you be my friend?  He's just a big, fat Italian loser.  All right, Frenchy.  All right, guys.  We don't want to burn you out.  No, no problem.  You've got a lot of heat.  I hear you.  A lot of heat.  A lot of heat.  Take it easy.  Let's hang up on Frenchy for today. 
[00:33:30]  There you go.  Not his appearance, but he still has that heat.  I thought it was pretty good.  I like it.  He's got that heat.  I liked it.  I love how all the hangarons are calling and they're all pissed off because Frenchy's got the  spotlight.  You know?  Well, when you're hot, you're hot.  He had a few new terms in there that time, too.  Remember when Dan from Hoboken had the spotlight?  The heat.  F-ball.  What's an F-ball? 
[00:34:00]  That guy is too friggin' much, man.  Who knew?  All right.  I want to curse him.  Johnny.  Johnny Race.  Rock and roll.  Yeah, of course.  Rock and roll.  Thanks for wrecking the show yesterday, Johnny.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  What did you put in the Jell-O shots?  Skymarker, baby.  I went to Johnny Race's house, my brother-in-law, for the Super Bowl party.  And, my God, the drinking that goes on at that house. 
[00:34:30]  Where's the tape of my mother singing some more Janis Joplin?  Oh, well, Joe's setting it up for you, man.  He's burning it on disc.  All right.  She's in trouble.  Yeah, we've got to hear that one.  My mother decided she was going to sing another Diddy Hammer.  Diddy, I'm still hungover.  Yeah.  You were a total mess.  Hey, man, I was dancing in my underwear with 30 people upstairs.  Rock and roll.  All the way over to me.  Johnny got on the drums late in the night. 
[00:35:00]  We were, like, playing some tunes.  And then we were just talking.  All right, what do you want to do next?  What do you want to do?  Johnny, you actually said this.  You put the sticks down on one of the drums.  You looked up and just went,  We can jump across this way.  I have no clue what you were talking about.  Straight out of Spinal Tap.  Oh, the guy was just annihilated.  Oh, man.  Well, thanks for the good time.  Everyone was.  Very good job.  You got a nice time to throw a party.  All right, boys.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll, Johnny.  Rock and roll.  That's his catchphrase. 
[00:35:30]  Rock and roll.  Everyone has a catchphrase on this show.  Rock and roll, Johnny Race.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Carlos Mencia should be in studio.  Yes.  In a minute.  Do we have some FUs today?  I think we have the FU line happening, right?  FU line.  And we'll take more of your phone calls in just a minute.  Stay there.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  This FU goes out to my ex-wife who thought after supporting her dumb ass for 10 years,  she could find better.  Now the guy you cheated on me with beats you on a daily basis, cheats on you, and makes 
[00:36:00]  your life living hell.  F*** you, Andy.  And thank you, Rusty, for getting rid of her.  Next message.  Hey, I want to give a big f*** you to the f***ing water company that shut off my water this morning  because now I had to take a shower with microwave bottles of Poland spring water and I burned  the hell out of my scalp, so f*** you.  Next message.  I want to say FU to my stepfather for getting my mother pregnant at the age of 56, man. 
[00:36:30]  What the f*** y'all thinking about, man?  Huh?  FU.  Pop, I don't care how many years you took care of me.  I'm too old to have a little brother or sister, and you're too old to be having a baby.  Next message.  Yo, this is a big f*** you to Frenchie.  I hope you f***ing choke on goddamn cafeteria French bread pizza, you f***ing piece of s***.  End of message.  Rain Wreck Radio. 
[00:37:00]  Like a bunch of people cheering on a race.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Oh, you scum.  Answer me.  Slime.  The Opium Anthony Show.  Yeah, this is the O&A Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  Hey, there's a douchebag on opianthony.com.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Trying to rile everyone up.  And he's claiming that our puke thing was a fake bit.  Oh, really?  Jeez, how do you, man?  Douchebag, there are too many people around for us to fake anything, first of all.  Second of all, people can't fake puking because they're eating what you think is clam chowder, you ass.  He's claiming that Stinky switched the puke bag with a bag of clam chowder on Friday's show from Boston, and then the people were eating spoonfuls of clam chowder. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, that's why.  And how do you explain them retching and puking uncontrollably, ass munch?  The second he put it in his mouth.  Ass douche.  Oh, idiot.  And they're like, well, you see, Don and Mike, for many years, have been trying to get guys to eat puke and bottle the fluids, and the lawyers always shut them down. 
[00:38:30]  We didn't tell anybody we were doing it.  We just went with it.  We didn't run it by anyone.  Douchebag.  What an ass.  Oh, well.  Yeah, look at the video.  And the fans of opianthony.com, they need to do a better job of, you know, protecting their guys.  Don't let these a-holes freaking run wild on your message board.  Tools.  They're just trying to cause trouble, and you allow it to happen. 
[00:39:00]  Check out the video if you think it's fake.  Yeah.  Go to foundrymusic.com.  I encourage everyone, go to foundrymusic.com.  You tell me that's fake.  That one spoonful, according to this ass munch, one spoonful of real clam chowder is going to make these guys puke like they did.  Now, you've got to remember, the guys that were eating the puke weren't the other guys that were shoving clam chowder into their face until they were so full they puked.  Right.  These were three brand-new contestants.  That just took one mouthful. 
[00:39:30]  That had nothing in their stomachs to that point.  Yeah, one mouthful of chowder.  And then lost it.  I'll be the first to tell you that, yeah, the lawyers would definitely have a problem with our listeners eating puke.  Without a doubt.  But we didn't get to where we are today by asking the lawyers for permission with everything we do.  Yeah.  Idiot.  That was spur of the moment.  You know, we, Chachi came up with more tickets.  We honestly didn't even know we had those tickets.  And then we had to figure out how to give them away. 
[00:40:00]  We had the tickets.  We had some puke.  Go with it.  Hundreds of people around the station checking it out.  You're trying to tell me all those people were in on the bit?  Yeah.  Idiot.  Christ.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, Dopey.  How you doing?  This is the board out from Boston.  What's up, Joey?  I was in the studio.  Yeah.  Okay.  And I have never smelled a more wretched smell in that studio.  I can't even.  You can ask anyone that was in the studio here if that was fake. 
[00:40:30]  I mean.  You know what?  We have ten more puke video clips up on foundrymusic.com.  You check it out for yourself and tell us if it was fake, idiot.  Well, I was in the studio and I will tell everyone that the smell that was in the studio, the only thing worse that was in the studio that smelled that bad was when Jim Cook brought in that barley.  That smell lasted for two days.  That smell like puke, yeah.  This stuff, it was wretched.  It was wretched.  It was really wretched.  So, there you go.  I was in the studio.  I can prove, you know, whatever. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know, you know.  There's a lot of people out there trying to rain on our parade.  It was not fake.  And trying to wreck our buzz.  So, they go to our message boards and they cause all sorts of problems.  Yeah, I was sitting right here, man.  It wasn't fake.  Believe me.  Well, we know it wasn't fake, but we don't want, you know, we don't.  We're trying to help you guys out.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Yeah.  Because a lot of guys would fake something like that.  That's why we're so pissed off.  All right?  Yeah.  Just look at the video.  That's all you got to do.  Look at the video.  Other shows don't, you know, film their stuff. 
[00:41:30]  It's as it happens.  So, they can fake things.  It's all on videotape for you to check out.  There you go.  Watch it frame by frame and tell us where the bait and switch happened.  Yeah.  Where the puke left the studio and the clam chowd arrived.  The bait and switch.  I'd like to know how you get a person to take one spoonful of chowder, if it was chowder.  Well, that's what they're saying.  And what?  That's stinky.  Switch the bags.  Yeah.  Stinky.  So, stinky's involved in the conspiracy.  Stinky ought to go into a dumpster and get the puke out. 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  Actually, this is really stupid because you know what the answer's going to be.  Stinky, did you switch the bag of puke with a bag of clam chowder?  Yes.  Now, that'll be on the message board.  See, I was listening to the Opie and Anthony show at 412, and Stinky admitted that he switched  the bags.  I like how you do the fake typing thing, Opie, as you were doing it.  I had to hop into a dumpster.  I know, yeah.  With all this other crap and find the one bag that just had the puke in.  And grab puke.  And then switch.  I mean, not switch. 
[00:42:30]  Next time, Stinky.  Next time we send you into a dumpster to find the puke, we're going to have to videotape  that as well.  Yeah.  For these ass wipes that want to wreck our buzz out there.  God.  Ah, well, it didn't wreck my buzz.  I love it.  I had fun that day.  And I saw something I'd never want to see again.  Guys eating vomit.  Dave, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, don't get pissed off me.  I'm not saying it was fake.  I'm just saying, I'm saying what you did is probably open yourself up to like a can of worms. 
[00:43:00]  That's why the lawyers wouldn't let it.  Whatever.  We didn't ask.  I'm saying if you did, there's no way because bodily fluids are in puke.  Oh, well.  We just went with it.  We didn't ask.  Oh, well.  I'm not saying it was fake.  I believe it was 100% real.  I saw the video.  All right.  Yeah, definitely.  This guy obviously doesn't listen to the O&A show closely because a lot of the things  that we end up doing that we didn't ask the lawyers about gets us in a lot of trouble.  Yeah.  Lawyer bus. 
[00:43:30]  Thank you, Dave.  That's right.  Maybe we were just that irresponsible, idiot.  Figure it out.  Matt, what's up?  Gentlemen.  Hey.  Frenchie.  Got to give kudos to Frenchie.  He is absolutely fantastic.  Don't mention.  I love it.  I love it.  Don't mention Frenchie.  Overexposure killed old dirty.  No, we don't want to overexpose him.  We don't want the overexposure.  No.  He's got to take limo Anthony and have shopping bag sex with him in the mall next time. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, he's great.  Take care, gentlemen.  The whole thing with Frenchie is he will never meet these people he fights.  No.  No, he doesn't want to fight.  No.  He just wants to rag him over the phone.  Yeah, that's why it's so frustrating to old dirty and Doug from Springfield and annoying  laugh Anthony.  They can't get to him.  They'll never see him.  He's well protected.  He's there to annoy you.  Right.  That's it.  It's his job.  A lot of people checking in from New Orleans wondering, where are we going? 
[00:44:30]  What are we doing?  I have some of the same questions.  I just read something for the New Orleans station.  We're broadcasting from Bourbon Street up in the balcony at a strip club.  Oh, my God.  So that means no one will be puking on us, thank God.  Wow.  It's called Temptations 327 Bourbon Street.  Yeah.  And we're going to be broadcasting live.  On a balcony.  On a balcony.  Overlooking Bourbon Street.  Friday.  Oh, debauchery.  And Billy Mack surveyed the area last weekend, or the Super Bowl, and said it's a very lovely 
[00:45:00]  spot.  A lot of people, really?  Yeah.  Getting a lot of emails from me.  Passed out?  Yeah.  Getting a lot of people from New York.  People going down there the same time we are.  So come on by.  Oh, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  For the ultimate party on Friday.  Uh-huh.  I can't wait.  Never been down there.  It's going to be...  Just here, it's a party.  I just hope I don't feel as crappy as I did yesterday.  But it'll be during the show, so I'll have a whole weekend to recoup.  Stacey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:45:30]  Well, Hong told me to call in.  Yeah.  I'll be representing New Orleans.  In the Naughty Nighty contest?  Yes.  Yeah.  And I need to book an appointment with Rick.  You need...  Uh, Rick?  Oh, Rick.  Rick, are you free Friday to take Stacey's shots, uh, live from New Orleans?  Uh, yeah.  Check your appointment book?  Definitely.  We can work her in.  Can we, uh, talk to the strip club and make sure they set up a little area for us if the  Naughty Nighty girls want to stop by?  I think that's already been set up.  Oh, nice.  That would be great.  We will be taking the last pictures of the, uh, of the contestants on Friday. 
[00:46:00]  And we're going to see if we can work the pull that the club might have into the shots.  Oh, imagine, like, the stage or something like that, and the lighting just in one of  those clubs.  Probably some of the girls, uh, down there are going to have some of the best pictures.  Oh, yeah.  I think.  Definitely.  Fantastic.  All right, Stacey, we'll see you Friday, okay?  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  So, there it is.  Hmm.  Uh, oh, wait.  This guy.  Yeah, there's brand new clips of the puke up on foundrymusic.com.  I haven't seen it.  Mark has just checked out the, uh, the clips.  Mark?  Yeah.  What's up, Mark? 
[00:46:30]  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Yeah, like I said, I was watching this one with, uh, what, Frank?  Yeah.  And, uh, eating one of toenails.  Hmm.  And it just, man, there's no way.  Mark, you just saw the clips.  Uh, you tell us how we faked that.  You didn't.  There's no way.  Oh.  So, whoever the guy is saying you're fake, but just wanting to get the attention, you  know?  I don't know why, but now I want to see, like, the clip.  Oh, of course.  I had to check it out, you know?  Right.  Yeah.  So. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, wait.  Tony's, uh, Tony's on line nine.  Uh, Tony.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, uh, I definitely believe in the conspiracy.  I spent an hour last night watching the videos.  Yeah.  If you look in the lower right-hand corner, you see, uh, Stinky doing a switch with a man  on a grassy knoll.  It's there.  You just got to look.  Very good.  Later.  Thank you, Frank.  Who was the first guy?  Uh, Frank, I think.  The big guy.  Frank?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  You got the video clip?  I'm trying to get it up.  Might be a problem because, uh, a lot of people probably checking it out right now.  So, I'll just, uh, yeah, people try to rain on our parade because their hero hasn't done  anything new in ten years.  So, you rain on our parade, I see.  Yeah, okay.  Douchebag.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, guys, I have some bad news for you.  I don't know if you did any, uh, reconnaissance in this place, Temptation, down in New Orleans.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  It's half transvestite, half regular girls.  And the only thing that separates the two clubs...  Oh.  No.  And I'm being, guys, I was there two years ago for a bachelor party, and I made the mistake  of getting caught.  All right.  Well, uh, yeah, you said there's only one thing that separates the transvestites from  the real girls, and my best line of the day was never heard, but okay.  I did hear it.  All right.  Well, we'll have to get to the bottom of that. 
[00:48:30]  Is that true, Ben?  Ben, can we figure that out?  Ben, you're all Billy Mac, uh, Billy Mac, uh, maybe he got hosed, but I, I...  The hosed.  The hosed.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  I'm going to go to, uh, cab driver Ricky, our, uh, correspondent down there in New Orleans.  Uh, Ricky.  Yo, how the hell are you?  What, what's up with this, uh, Temptation strip club down there?  Man, look, dude, it's not, it's right next to one of those little punk bars.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  But it, I mean, it's clear to see his big-ass sign, Temptation, with a balcony.  Man, you're going to love it, man.  All right.  What about the transvestites, though, uh, cab driver Ricky?  Oh, man, those, those are some crazy bastards.  Some of them, some of them look kind of real, dude.  You got to watch yourself, dude.  I don't think he, no, yeah.  Norton's got to watch himself.  He's the one that'll go for it.  Yeah, Norton probably will love it.  Hold on, Ricky.  Have you been in this establishment, and, and they have the transvestites walking around?  Dude, they're not in Temptations, man.  I got a dude that said I was a goddamn lie, dude. 
[00:49:30]  All right, good.  Dude, I work around there.  I'm a cab driver.  Come on.  What did a dude what's from their fair day just now, dude?  Yeah, this is part of our new format.  Every show needs a cab driver, so, uh, we got, we got our wacky cab driver.  Yeah, check this out.  It's crazy.  Oh, God.  Did y'all be wrestling last night?  He's crazy Ricky.  Crazy Ricky.  Nah, cab driver Ricky, yo.  All right, but we got to give you, like, a title like crazy.  How about crazy cabbie Ricky?  No, that's taken.  Oh, check it out.  Yo, did you see Trish Stratus get her ass beat last night? 
[00:50:00]  Uh, no, I did not.  Oh, man, that was awesome.  That new chick.  All right.  That new chick jazz.  All right, Ricky, we might have to find another cab driver.  You don't have much heat.  Huh?  We're looking for a cab driver with some heat.  Yeah, I got heat, yo.  I can ride y'all around if y'all come down here, dude.  All right, well, stop by on Friday so we can check you out, all right?  All right, man, you be cool.  All right, bro.  Hey.  This is so funny to watch.  What are you looking at?  I'm watching one of the guys puking.  He's trying so hard to hold it in, and he's just going, boop, boop, boop. 
[00:50:30]  Is that the guy you made up?  Oh, no.  And then he just boops it out of his mouth.  Does it look fake, Ant?  No.  Where do we get our actors from?  I don't know.  They're very good.  Oh.  What's up, boys?  If you want to talk about fake, go listen to Rocco.  There's fake fake.  There's fake. 
[00:51:00]  Johnny Hardrock, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  There's no transvestites in that club.  This is my third Mardi Gras on a row that I'll be at, and there is not a transvestite to be found there.  There may be some undesirable-looking women, but there's definitely no transvestites.  Well, good.  All right.  Well, the transvestites will be all over the streets, but not in that club, right?  No, there's a club across the street that is strictly transvestites, and they kind of stand outside and catcall all the guys,  but there's definitely none in that place.  All right.  Right on, bro.  See you.  Thank you. 
[00:51:30]  I can't wait.  And broadcasting from a strip club, how cool is that?  The balcony.  You know how many cans we're going to see?  You've seen that Girls Gone Wild videos.  They show the clam, everything.  Hey, what are the strip clubs like down there?  Is it totally naked?  Might as well be.  Totally nude?  Totally nude.  How do they compete with the street?  I don't know.  That's what I want to know.  They must be.  Do you have to intro the dancers?  No, we won't have to do any of that.  Hey, this guy might know.  Mike.  Where are we going?  Lived in New Orleans for a year. 
[00:52:00]  Line 11?  All right.  Hey, Mike.  Mikey.  Mike.  Yeah?  Strip clubs down in New Orleans, totally nude or bottoms?  Well, I tell you, I haven't been there in a few years, but man, the streets are totally nude.  You guys are going to have such a blast.  I was down there a long time ago for Mardi Gras.  Yeah.  It is definitely the biggest party in the country, man.  Can we bring our sticky cam and just kind of put it on the balcony there?  That would be nice, man.  You guys are going to be great down there.  I wish I was going, man. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, we're going to take hundreds of pictures and send them up while we broadcast for you.  Yeah.  That is so cool, man.  You guys are going to have a blast.  Cool, bro.  It's really a nice place.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Have a good time.  Bye.  I just want to know if there's clam.  Like, that was one thing that was good about Boston.  Hold on.  I can help you out.  They got it all in Boston.  Very, very conservative.  Very stuffy.  But, boy, you go into those clubs, you're seeing gay.  Well, it's over the border in New Hampshire.  Well.  Ten Show Club. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, Steve.  And Matt's nude.  What about it?  Well, man, you guys, it's going to be off the wall.  Don't worry about the strippers.  Just worry about the dirty little girls running around on the streets.  Well, that's cool.  But in the strip clubs, is it nude?  No.  Little panties running around.  You get to the back, you get to the private booth, you might be all right.  Good.  Anyway, man.  Thank God.  That was starting to throw down some bumper stickers down here.  Give me a job.  I'll plant the bourbon street for you.  We'll bring a whole S-load of wow stickers.  Right, Rick?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll have all that stuff.  All right, Steve.  All right, bro.  We'll see you down there. 
[00:53:30]  Later.  Peace.  Is Carlos on his way?  Yeah.  Running late?  Carlos.  A little bit late.  Did you take that girl's pictures?  Working on it.  Working on the latest contestant for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Her picks will be up in a half hour.  Now we've got to play Frank Puken as we take a break.  Yeah.  Got to play the puke.  It was just the sound.  Oh, just the sound?  Yeah.  Listen to that.  Yeah, that's the sound. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, that's the sound of someone faking Puken.  Oh, you hear that little, like, phlegm catch at the end.  Now what's this?  All right, we'll play Frank Puken.  This was for the Super Bowl tickets.  He had to, like, scoop up a bit of the fake puke.  Okay, we're in on it.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, douche.  Is this going to be it, though, with the puke for a little while? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I guess.  It makes me, I swear to God, it makes me nauseous.  I guarantee Friday we'll have audio of people puking.  Oh, I don't doubt that.  Guaranteed.  That's our new thing, Ant, to get the ratings up.  Puking.  Puking.  Puking.  All right, here's Frank.  He had the bag of puke in front of him.  Yeah.  All he had to do was take one lousy spoonful of puke, eat it, keep it down, and he had Super  Bowl tickets.  Right.  You tell me this is fake.  And then go check out the video on foundrymusic.com. 
[00:55:00]  All right, here we go.  The contest is on.  I can't watch this.  Super Bowl tickets.  Oh, my God, I can't watch this.  He's got a big heap in helping.  All right, here goes.  Super Bowl tickets.  Go ahead, Frank.  All right.  And we do this until someone backs out.  Now, this is what we do.  You will each alternate with spoonfuls until one of you either puke or back out.  Wait, wait, you've got to get this straight.  You don't just eat a spoonful and go to the Super Bowl.  You eat a spoonful of what?  You will eat one, then he will eat one, then he will eat one.  And you will keep going round and round eating spoonful after spoonful until one of you puke 
[00:55:30]  or say no.  Then you're out.  And then you will continue the two of you.  Oh, my God.  So it could be a lot of spoonfuls of puke before you win.  And then last guy standing's got a pair.  Go Pats.  Go Pats, Frank.  Go Pats.  And here he goes.  There we go.  Here goes Frank.  There you go, Frank.  It's all right, Frank.  Do it now.  Swallow it.  Swallow it, Frank.  Frank stretching. 
[00:56:00]  Frank.  Oh, Frank pukes.  Frank pukes.  Wait, did he puke or did he...  Frank, Frank pukes.  Did he puke or did he see it?  He pukes.  He pukes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's in my beverage.  Oh, my God.  Frank, you all right, Frank?  Frank, you all right, man? 
[00:56:30]  Frank.  Frank, what's the matter?  He's doubled over.  Frank, what did it taste like?  What made you puke?  Frank, you'll feel better.  Just puke, man.  Puke, Frank.  Get it out, Frank.  Get it out of you, man.  Frank, hang in the studio, though.  Frank, what happened, man?  If those two guys have the same thing happen, then we've got to figure something else out.  Hey, what are you doing?  All right. 
[00:57:00]  Well, Frank, just stay there.  Finally, finally, finally, the ultimate degenerates meet the ultimate decadence.  This Friday, the O.P. and Anthony Show broadcasts live from Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  Oh, my God.  We're back with the O.N.A. Show.  Carlos Mencia in the studio.  Before we get to Carlos and find out what he's up to, got a great instant feedback here. 
[00:57:30]  And, Carlos, you could, you know.  I'm here, bro.  Okay, good.  Uh, Joe from the City writes, you guys just played the F.U. line, and there was a 56-year-old pregnant mom.  F'd up funny, man.  Did you notice when we played the F.U. line?  No.  Rick got it for us.  A 56-year-old pregnant mom?  And I guess this is Big Mike, who's the regular on the show.  Okay.  So if there's a story to be told here, Big Mike, you've got to give us a call.  But this is the F.U. he left on the F.U. line. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  I want to say F.U. to my stepfather.  For getting my mother pregnant at the age of 56, man.  What the F.U. are y'all thinking about, man?  Huh?  F.U.  Pop, I don't care how many years you took care of me.  I'm too old to have a little brother or sister.  And you're too old to be having a baby.  That was his F.U.  It went right by our heads today.  I'm too old.  Wow.  Your little brother.  But see, he's looking to the future.  He knows mom's, what, 56. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  She'll probably die in what, uh, and he figured, man, I'm going to take care of this baby from  nine all the way to eight.  Oh, that's a bull.  He's going to be a dad.  Yeah, exactly, man.  Have to deal with a little kid.  He doesn't care about the brother.  You know he doesn't care about being a brother.  It's the fact that he knows he's going to be a dad, the parents are going to croak, and  he's going to be stuck.  This is a story that he needs to tell.  He'll call the show.  He listens every day.  Very fertile.  Almost as good as the story we heard yesterday.  What was the story yesterday?  This is the sickest friggin' thing.  And Dice kind of wrecked the story a little bit. 
[00:59:00]  Threw a monkey wrench into it.  There was so much more he wanted to get out of Laura Korn with this story, but then Dice  called out of nowhere.  Here's the, briefly, as brief as I can be, what Laura Korn told us.  Listen to this.  And who is Laura Korn?  She's a sexpert who writes, like, you know, books on how couples can have better sex together.  Oh, she's one of those.  Isn't there, like, a D'Angelo or something, Angelo Chick, something like that?  There's a lot of them.  There's a lot of them.  It's pretty cool, though.  We know what it is.  It's, it's, it's, hold on, Big Mike's checking out.  Ah, damn it.  Okay, then we'll get to Laura Korn's story. 
[00:59:30]  One story at a time, because it's only one thought per break.  Oh, right.  Or the listeners get confused at it.  Learned that in radio school.  Yo, man.  Big Mike.  What's up?  What up?  What up, man?  Is that?  I feel, I feel bad, man.  Is that a fake story or a real story?  No, it's real, man.  Because we don't do fake radio here.  It's the real deal, man.  Your pops knocked up, uh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, it's your stepdad?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're going to be a father?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not good, though, man, but I'm upset, man. 
[01:00:00]  Wait, Big Mike, how old are you?  Oh, me?  Yeah.  Ah, anonymous, man.  I'm going to leave it alone.  I'm not even going to say.  I'm just wondering what the age difference will be.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You and your half brother or whatever, half sister, whatever it turns out to be.  Yeah, I'm going to never have to take care of the child, man.  There's no way your mom's pregnant at 56 years old.  Man.  How much you want to make them pregnant?  Oh, you know, as life expectancy gets longer, the time that a woman can produce gets a little  longer.  Exactly.  Although you don't want to think of the poor little kid being in a uterus that's like a 
[01:00:30]  walnut shell.  Yeah.  They might have dried up.  Maybe she's just getting fat and she doesn't want to tell her husband.  No, my mom, as a matter of fact, my mom and my pops are in real good shape, man.  Oh, yeah?  Your mom must be in real good shape.  They took care of this stuff, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Would there be any reason, though, she would lie?  You know what I'm saying?  Nah, nah, nah, man.  My mom's don't lie like that, man.  So when is this kid dropping, bro?  What happened?  When's the kid dropping?  Probably another seven months, man. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Jeez, man.  How did your mom tell you?  She just came out and told me.  You know, me and my moms, we keep it real with each other.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Not as real as your stepdad's keeping it real, man.  That's not real, my friend.  You all live in the same house?  Nah, I don't know, man.  I got my own house, man.  I'm just wondering if you're hearing what's going on.  Nah, nah, I'm a grown man.  I hold my own, you know?  Basically, you're going to be about 50 when this kid turns 18, right?  Am I about right?  Basically, yeah.  He's going to have to take you to the father-son stuff at school. 
[01:01:30]  Exactly.  So it doesn't look ridiculous that an 80-year-old man is his father.  But it's all good, though, man.  That was always bad when I went to school.  You know, all I'm just saying, they're too old to be having babies, man.  Of course they are.  56.  Yeah.  Too old, man.  How many kids did your mom, you know, pop out?  Oh, I'm the only child, man.  Only child.  Oh, that.  See, that's got something to do with it, too.  Come on, now.  It's a little jealousy.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I'm not the little boy anymore. 
[01:02:00]  Good one, Mom.  Yeah, you're a competition.  It's over.  I'm still the baby, mother effer.  Yeah, exactly.  I got a really stupid question.  Oh, he get to go to the baby gap.  Oh, he get to go to the baby gap.  Don't kill me, man.  Don't kill me.  I'm upset as you do, man.  And, you know, I got to go out working, man.  Hold on.  It's a stupid question, but was this a mistake or was this planned?  Yo, I don't know.  I'm not in the bedroom with them.  Can I call your mom, Big Mike? 
[01:02:30]  Nah, hell no.  Hey, Big Mike, did you snap at your mom like you snapped on the FU line?  Nah, I just said a few words, you know.  But, you know, my mom's is my mom's, man.  My mom's raised me.  I think she'll do good.  But, you know, she's cool, man.  Changing diapers at 56.  She's going to change hers.  Then she's going to change the babies.  Y'all ain't going to father somewhere.  Ah, changing each other's.  Yeah, exactly.  She's going to change it to pens and his pampers.  Come on, man.  Hey, yo, y'all take it easy, man.  I'll call it tomorrow, man.  See how y'all doing, all right? 
[01:03:00]  Big Mike, you've got to tell your mom to give up the Hummer, man.  Nah.  Yo, man, I've got to go, man.  All right, there he is.  All right, peace.  That's just a nasty thing because, you know, you get parents that are in their 60s or even  pushing 70 when the kid is in his late teens, stuff like that.  Whew, you're not relating to the kid.  You can't throw the ball around with him.  Right.  Something like that.  So I think it's kind of selfish, you know what I mean?  But it might just be a mistake.  Remember going to school, though? 
[01:03:30]  I was going to mention this.  We used to have the father-son things or, you know, the parent-teacher conferences.  Right.  And you go to school and there was always that kid that was the late-in-life child.  Right.  It's like, oh, my God.  Here comes this old fossil couple.  It's like, oh, is that your grandma?  And they're like, was that your trouble?  No, my mother was like, forget about it.  She was 22, I think, when I was going to school.  I think in high school she was 22.  But there's the opposite, bro.  You know, there's the way us fics do it, where we're 14 and our kid's 8, you know what I mean? 
[01:04:00]  And we're going to high school, you know what I'm saying?  We're in detention and our kid walks by the hall room.  What are you doing here, Dad?  Shut up.  Keep walking.  You know what I'm saying?  How old was your parents when they had their last kid?  Because you have, like, what, 17 brothers and sisters?  Yeah, it's 18 of us.  I think she was 42, the last one.  But she started at 15, bro.  And still younger than, right, right, started at 15.  Yeah.  But it sucks for my sister because, you know, she has aunts that are three.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:04:30]  Like, it's like this whole weird, you know.  Yeah, it screws up the family tree.  Yeah, exactly.  When you've got the three-year-old aunts and uncles.  Exactly, man.  That's odd.  Tell Carlos the other story.  Oh, yeah, the story from yesterday.  Yeah, so Laura Corn was in here.  This is one of the sickest stories you'll ever hear, my friend.  She's one of those women.  She sells books about sex to the married couples that just ain't happening for them anymore, you know.  It's like all of a sudden you're not getting any.  And she's got these books and little things.  All right, tear out one page, read it to your mate, and, you know, hop on the bed, give her a slam. 
[01:05:00]  So she had this assistant.  Her name was Meg.  Meg, she was a raging alcoholic, drunk all the time.  When Laura was away one day, Meg used Laura's apartment to have sex with a guy.  The guy does it in the back door, balloon knot.  In the leather Cheerio.  Right.  That's right.  He lets go there.  Right.  She gets up, goes to the fertility clinic across town, has it removed from there, and put in the baby-making place. 
[01:05:30]  Has a baby.  Now, this guy didn't know, you know, he was just unleashing.  He was trying to have some fun.  Yeah, right.  Right.  Being safe as far as pregnancy goes.  Purposely did the blue knot, so.  Yeah, you know she's not going to get pregnant there.  Yeah.  Then the woman has the baby.  A couple of years later, dies of alcoholism.  And the baby's put up for adoption.  But now the guy is suing Laura Korn for theft of seed because it was in her apartment. 
[01:06:00]  Thieving the.  Saying she was in on this.  That she was in on it.  Like, it was a conspiracy that she planned with this woman to.  I'm just.  And then the other questions that came up were, what kind of ethics did a doctor have to take a turkey baste to her back door like that, extract it, and then put it in so she could have a kid?  Did she do it at a.  Did a legitimate doctor do it?  That's what I hear. 
[01:06:30]  That's what she said.  It seems like anyone could do it, but it doesn't seem very sanitary.  You know, and then what kind of issues is that kid going to have when he grows up?  He's going to be.  He's going to have a crappy attitude.  You've got some funky tastings, Monk.  It just sounds.  It was one of those stories that, like, I could just picture, you know, cheeks all clenched up walking through the front door trying to save every drop.  Unless she did something in her apartment before she went to the fertility clinic. 
[01:07:00]  Did she put it in a little baggy or something?  Yeah, let it go.  Maybe it was already in a little baggy, if you know what I mean.  I don't know.  Well, unfortunately, we won't get to the bottom of it.  No, the lady got to the bottom of it.  That's funny, Opie.  Get to the bottom of it.  Get to the bottom of it.  Bet the kid had brown eyes.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, Opie and Anthony, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I have the same problem as Big Mike.  Hey, wait, wait.  What's your name?  Gary.  But it's 14-year-old Gary.  You're 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah, I'm not 12-year-old Gary.  12-year-old Gary.  You know what? 
[01:07:30]  He used to be 11-year-old Gary, but he had a birthday recently.  Dude, if this guy doesn't sound exactly like Gary's going to sound in two years, though,  listen to him.  Listen to his voice.  Yeah, it's close.  He's got the same tone.  So, what's up?  You're a 14-year-old Gary.  What happened?  My dad's 67 and my mom is 50.  12-year-old Gary from the future.  Wait, your dad is 67 and your mom is 50?  Yeah.  And she just got pregnant?  No.  I'm 14 years old.  14?  Yeah, my parents got me conceived to 50.  Your dad was 53 when your mom had you. 
[01:08:00]  And your mom was 36, I guess?  Yeah.  Wow.  And it's pretty sick because every time when I go out to home with my dad,  and I'm with my friends, they're like, hey, how's your grandpa doing?  That's my dad.  And then when I go with my mom, it's like, hi, hello, are you Gary's grandma?  Oh.  So, every time I was getting embarrassed for that.  Yeah, Gary, do you, uh, Gary, your friends, like, you know, they have the hot moms.  Yeah, they do. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, you have some of the moms around the school that are hot.  None of your friends want to come over to your house to check out your mom, right?  No.  Because I used to go over to this one kid's house in high school all the time because he had the hot mom.  The hot mom.  The young hot mom.  That offered the hot chocolate.  Looking at the creamy thighs.  Yeah.  Hey, Gary, would you, uh, would you rather be dead than be made fun of, or is it better to be alive and be made fun of? 
[01:09:00]  It's better to be alive.  Then shut your ass up and go home, stupid.  Hey, Gary.  Yeah?  I think, uh, someone's on the phone and wants to talk to you.  Yeah, okay.  It's 12-year-old Gary.  Hang up the phone, you wannabe!  You'll never be like me!  Shut up, Gary!  You 60-year-old mother and father!  Hang up!  I'm not gonna hang up, you skink!  Hang up!  You wanna be bastard!  Shut up!  No!  Shut up, Gary! 
[01:09:30]  Is that all you can say?  I'm just trying to show you!  You're not!  Goodbye!  Hang up the phone!  Hang up the phone!  I must say, I'm enjoying 14-year-old Gary.  He's got a certain maturity in his voice that you're lacking, 12-year-old Gary.  14-year-old Gary might, uh, might have a little more heat than 12-year-old Gary.  Nope.  You'll never.  We're on a new kick on the O&A show.  Out with the old, in with the new.  You're not kicking me off!  I'm thinking 14-year-old Gary.  I'm taking me off.  I'm thinking 14-year-old Gary.  I'm calling up Anthony, you stalker! 
[01:10:00]  I'm a stalker!  Look who's talking, wannabe!  Hey, 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah?  You wanna go to a hockey game?  No, man, I can't go.  Why?  I got great seats, man, right behind the goal.  Well, I can go.  You can?  Yeah.  All right, we're gonna put you on hold, and I'm gonna take you to a hockey game.  Son of a bitch!  You kids in your new language.  Hold on, you.  You're gonna be turning me.  Hold on, you crazy kid.  Gary, you're coming in tomorrow, right?  Yes.  12-year-old Gary? 
[01:10:30]  Well, I don't think you should.  I think you should cancel and bring in 14-year-old Gary.  I think I like 14-year-old Gary.  I think so, too.  What do you think the listeners think?  Maybe we should let the listeners decide.  Hey, listen, I'm a listener.  I think Craig and 10.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's ask Craig.  All right, hold on.  This might screw up everything.  Let's try this.  Uh, Craig, what's up?  Yeah, 14-year-old Gary rules.  Get rid of 12.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Get rid of him! 
[01:11:00]  Aw.  All right, hold on.  Let me get these things.  I don't know.  What?  I like the 12-year-old Gary.  We're on a new kick, though.  He's been...  He's out of loyalty to the show that I think we shouldn't...  We shouldn't throw him away.  Stop being a pussy.  Let it go.  12-year-old Gary.  Yeah.  I think you're cool, and you're coming in tomorrow.  Yeah.  I like 14-year-old Gary.  Hey, 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah?  What do you want to say to 12-year-old Gary?  You suck!  Your mother does, too!  Oh! 
[01:11:30]  Oh!  You're trying to go through!  Try me!  Try me!  You tramp!  Look who's talking.  Hey, 14-year-old Gary, how tall are you?  I'm about 6'1".  Wow!  Whoa!  Yeah, I'm 6'1".  Man, that puberty's a bitch, isn't it?  Yeah.  6'1", where you got those big flipper feet.  6'1", and he's 14, so he's in the ninth grade, man, and he's taller than everybody else  in high school, pretty much.  You play basketball?  No.  Actually, there's other kids that are taller than me.  How tall...  How much do you weigh there, 14-year-old Gary? 
[01:12:00]  I'm only 150.  150.  12-year-old Gary, only five foot, but puberty's right around the corner, my friend.  Yeah, that's what he says.  See what you got tall or two?  Huh?  See what you got to look forward to, 12-year-old Gary?  Yep.  What happened?  What's going on for him?  Hey, 12-year-old Gary, you okay?  No.  No.  Hey, 12-year-old Gary.  You're our pal.  12-year-old Gary, what's wrong?  Hey, 12-year-old Gary.  Yeah?  You're coming in tomorrow, right? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  What's the heck to have you?  I can't have a 12-year-old car.  Come on, Gary.  Oh, come on.  This is bad for the show, bro.  You made a 12-year-old cry.  This is going to be on the news, man.  Gary, you know you're our pal, right?  Yeah.  What's wrong with 12-year-old Gary?  You know, if you put this friggin' wannabe bastard on this alleyway, I would box him so  his face and his skull found a friggin' heart.  You think I'm joking, don't you?  Yes, I think you are.  Yeah, you little pervert bastard. 
[01:13:00]  Shut up, you tramp.  Gary?  Yeah?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm all right.  No, no, 12-year-old Gary.  I don't care.  12-year-old Gary, you're cool, right?  12-year-old Gary?  Yeah, me.  Yeah, everything's fine, right?  You sure?  You're not upset with us or anything.  I'm not upset with you.  I'm just upset with this wannabe bastard.  All right.  I love you, Gary.  I love you, Gary.  I love you, Gary.  I bet it's Eddie, and he's embarrassed of friggin' his name on the radio.  Hey, ma'am, my middle name's Edward.  Sorry about that.  All right. 
[01:13:30]  No offense about you.  Are your feelings hurt, Gary?  No.  12-year-old Gary?  No.  Just because 14-year-old Gary is older and puberty has hit and he's probably getting laid  like crazy?  No.  He's right around the corner for me.  Hey, 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah?  You want to come in tomorrow?  I can't.  Why?  Got school.  Oh.  Hey, 12-year-old Gary.  Yeah.  Why don't you have school tomorrow?  I have school.  Then how are you coming into the show?  My dad's taking me a little early, I guess. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, a little early.  Yeah.  All right.  See, that's kind of cool of his dad, 14-year-old Gary.  He's got a 60-year-old dad with that friggin' mini wagon.  Shut your mouth.  He's from the 1980s.  Hey, Gary, watch the F-bomb.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  14-year-old Gary.  He's going to start talking about the little wooden side panels and he stopped them.  14-year-old Gary, relax.  I think 12-year-old Gary got your sensitive spot there. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  He's very protective of his 67-year-old dad there.  I'm very protective of you guys.  And if I lose you, I'm going to get pissed off.  Well, eventually it's going to be out with the old and with the new.  I think 12-year-old Gary still has enough.  I think you've got time, though, 12-year-old Gary.  I think you'll at least make it to 13-year-old Gary before we start thinking of replacing you.  Yep.  And then by the time I'm 13-year-old Gary, he'll be 15-year-old Gary.  Why are you really intelligent? 
[01:15:00]  What?  He said you're really intelligent because you can count.  Yeah, he said you're good at math.  Yeah, look who's talking.  Can you count how old your dad was when he was born?  Well, 14-year-old Gary's dad was 53.  But who's keeping track there?  Gary, how old was your dad when you were born?  14 years old.  In the 30s.  In his 30s, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, yo, stop lying, Gary.  Your dad was 14. 
[01:15:30]  Isn't that funny?  Gary's dad was in his 30s.  No, no, no, no, no.  And 14-year-old Gary's was born in the 30s.  No, no, no, no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.  You can't talk about my father.  He wasn't 13, so shut your mouth.  You weren't around.  I'm guaranteeing your father was like two when he had you.  Yeah, okay.  Two?  Whatever, I don't care.  Gary, you were doing well.  Congratulations.  What happened?  You were doing well there.  Yeah, yeah.  I pissed off.  No, my mind's not working.  I'm freaking pissed off.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll see you tomorrow, 12-year-old Gary.  All right.  Hold on.  There's another Gary that wants to be a new character on our show. 
[01:16:00]  Gary?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a new character for you guys, 28-year-old Gary.  I'm divorced.  I work for Xerox.  And I think both those Garys are just play-a-haters.  No, I think that you guys are all the same person.  Is your mom named Meg Korn?  No, actually I'm not.  Oh, Meg.  It's definitely not the 14-year-old. 
[01:16:30]  Hey, 28-year-old Gary, you want to go to a hockey game?  Because at least we could go to a bar.  Yeah.  Can I go to the one where they're playing the Rangers?  Hey, I think I do, too.  All right.  Thank you, 28-year-old Gary.  I kind of like 28-year-old Gary.  He's like, you can hang and have some beers, right?  There's someone you can at least hang with.  Yeah, exactly.  And they don't have to get him home by 10.  Actually, 11.  I think it's some wild back-to-the-future thing with it.  But, yeah, 28-year-old Gary.  12-year-old Gary should look at these other guys and see where his life is headed. 
[01:17:00]  So here's you're going to be a little snappy.  Right.  But by the time you're 28, you're going to be balding.  You're going to lose your job.  Hell no.  Look where your life's going.  Hey, you're making fun of Carl's men, see you?  Well, you know, he's jumping on my back.  I'll jump on his back.  That's beautiful.  Gary, don't take no guff.  I take nothing from anybody.  He almost cried.  And look, he's coming back strong.  Yeah, he's coming back strong.  Coming back strong in the late rounds. 
[01:17:30]  So you see, I still have heat, even when I'm down.  Wow.  All right, 14-year-old Gary.  Gary, you got any final words for 12-year-old Gary?  You're sorry?  Your mother does too.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  14-year-old Gary, keep in touch.  All right.  Then I'll call maybe tomorrow.  Yeah, we like the 14-year-old Gary.  We're going to try to develop you as a doctor.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  We'll see how the fans take it.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  12-year-old Gary, we'll see you tomorrow, all right?  All right.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  See you guys.  The voice is the same. 
[01:18:00]  It's just that two-year difference.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  If we would have gotten like a two-year-old Gary, that would have been the whole story.  I'm telling you, man.  The Gary collection.  22.  Things are looking good.  I might play basketball.  I got accepted to NYC.  It's going to rock.  You know what I mean?  We can do that tomorrow when he comes in.  We'll just have a whole spectrum.  We'll have a whole spectrum of Gary's and Gary can see his life.  Yeah.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  The only thing that could have improved that last exchange was 12-year-old Gary saying,  get in the box. 
[01:18:30]  Die.  Get in the box.  Yeah, too bad 12-year-old Gary doesn't have that French accent.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Hey, I got one other callback on the DC listener's reaction.  I think it goes something like this.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  Whew.  All right there.  Okay.  Terrific.  Thank you, John.  Sorry.  I suck.  That's okay, man.  I love that.  Sorry.  I suck.  I wish it was Gary and you were 24. 
[01:19:00]  I wish it was perfect.  Let's go to Foz in Cleveland.  Foz.  Guys, what's up?  What's up, bro?  Cleveland's still representing strong in the Naughty Naughty Contest, man.  I got two more girls here.  Two more girls getting their pictures taken for the Naughty Naughty Contest.  We have one here in New York so far today, so we're trying to get 100 women before Friday.  We're up to 72, I believe.  Well, leave it up to us in Cleveland, man.  We'll get you 100 women.  What do these girls look like?  These girls are pretty good looking, man.  I got Kenzie and Tracy, and they did some pictures separately, and then they did some 
[01:19:30]  pictures together.  Oh.  We like that.  We like the lesbianism here in Cleveland.  That's very nice.  I think we like that everywhere, my friend.  All right, cool.  We can't wait to see the pictures.  They're on their way, man.  So, Cleveland representing strong.  Beat us now.  Thank you, Foz.  Where are the hottest chicks coming from?  Honestly.  Honestly, Sacramento only has two girls, but all three are solid.  Actually, two out of the three, because I think one dropped out.  Philly, nice representation. 
[01:20:00]  Philly is great.  Boston coming on strong.  This is Cleveland.  Honestly, New York, so far.  Just me.  Right.  Not bad.  Sacramento.  Where's Sac?  Let me see Sac.  Because Sac is a heinous town.  Sacramento, though, they've got a professional photographer.  This is Sacramento.  They've got strobe lights and everything working in the contest.  Oh, look at that.  That's Sacramento, right?  That's Sacramento.  It looks like on the side of Kmart, that picture.  It's got that little light thing happening. 
[01:20:30]  That's what we're saying.  The lighting is great.  Right.  They know how to take pictures in Sacramento.  By the way, we should remind all the ladies, qualifying finally ends Friday.  Friday's it, huh?  That's the deadline.  Friday is it.  Yeah.  And what do the winners get, or the winner, or whatever?  Nice trip to Hedonism 3 and other things.  Cash.  We just had a girl from New York take pictures, right?  She looked good.  It's not up yet?  It should be up soon.  Is it the one that was out there half naked?  Yeah.  Of course. 
[01:21:00]  She's wearing a jacket, and that's it, man.  Yeah.  And Rick's posing her.  All right.  Do this with your hand.  So, ladies, if you have that naughty night, you get down on the radio stations that are  in the contest, and get your pictures taken between now and Friday.  If you need details, excuse me, go to opianathlete.com.  Yes.  You all right there, buddy?  Yeah.  I'm, like, under the weather today, like, allergy thing or something.  What do you got to have a good time?  You got the sniffles?  You saw me in the back office.  I'm surprised I'm on the air.  Slammed a lot of cold medicine and came in here.  Carlos Mencia.  We're going to catch up with our pal next, okay? 
[01:21:30]  He's doing something for Comedy Central, and he has to deal with the TV censors.  The horror!  All right.  We'll talk about it next.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call any time.  212-830-378.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up? 
[01:22:00]  Carlos Mencia in the house.  Yeah.  He's taping something for Comedy Central.  Oh.  And it looks like he doesn't want to tape anything for Comedy Central.  I'm sure he's thrilled with the opportunity.  Yeah.  He's just working within the constraints of some of their, what, standards and practice.  Go back to HBO where you have freedom!  Oh, yeah, man.  HBO's awesome, dude.  But they're not doing HBO specials like they used to is a problem.  You know why?  They actually have programming that's working now at HBO. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  That used to be, you know, their shows sucked, so they would throw in the comedians.  Right.  Now they got, you know, now it's hip to have a TV show on HBO.  It used to be, your show's on HBO.  You couldn't get it on the network.  Right, right.  You know, they got the Sopranos.  Yeah, well, Larry Sanders and those guys started it all off, and, you know, so now they don't.  They just do those half-hour programmings and do them instead of, you know, putting HBO specials.  Yeah.  These comics out in the cold.  Yeah, so Comedy Central's doing them.  I mean, it's cool.  It's just, you know.  HBO should have done you again instead of Mr. Carlin, my friend. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  It's like a special, you know, we got to tell it like it is.  There are just some people that may, you know, hey, Carlin, genius, but time is taking its toll.  And they run it every freaking weekend.  I'm watching it, and I'm kind of psyched.  You know, I sit down, I watch George Carlin, and I'm like, oh, boy, this ain't working.  Yeah.  This ain't working.  Well, he did it live, and he didn't do a lot of, you know, a lot of 9-11 stuff, which to me is like, you know, 
[01:23:30]  if you're a comedian that talks about what's going on, how could you not talk about that?  You got it.  For two hours.  But you know what I'm saying?  I mean, it's like that big-ass elephant back there, you know what I mean?  So it's kind of like that.  Everyone knows it's there.  Yeah, so that's what's tough about this, that they're like, you know, we don't want you to do a whole,  and it turns out to be like 22 minutes, and it's a half an hour.  They told you that they didn't want you to do a. . .  They said you can do like, there's four breaks, so I can do one break at 9-11 stuff,  but, you know, they don't want the other stuff to be 9-11.  See, you know, I don't like that. 
[01:24:00]  I don't either.  If they want you for Comedy Central, they should say, here, you got four segments, go.  Yeah, and as long as I don't curse, you know what I mean?  Yeah, they don't want the cursing.  But they're afraid that Tide is going to get, you know, or one of, you know what I mean?  Tide's going to get upset if you just keep talking about 9-11, which I don't understand.  Tide gets mad at Bill Maher for saying that our soldiers are a bunch of pusses.  Yeah.  Right?  And I'm going to get in trouble because I say our army kicks ass?  I don't get it.  I don't get it. 
[01:24:30]  I don't understand it, man.  Yeah, they're very oversensitive with the sponsors.  They don't want you.  I don't know what it is.  I think they think the potential for you to say something that might chase away sponsors is there.  Because they're just talking about something so controversial.  But what's the big deal?  I wanted to say towel head, and they were like, no.  And I said, Tide would love that.  I mean, they've got to wash their towels.  That's good for Tide.  Why is that bad for Tide?  I don't get it, man.  You can't say towel head.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Didn't Cartman on South Park call them sand monkeys? 
[01:25:00]  Yes, he did.  And towel heads?  Yes, he did.  We got the clip.  Sand monkeys.  We got the goddamn clip.  Oh, you know what I got, okay?  I could say Alibaba.  I can call them Alibabas.  Alibaba.  Exactly, bro.  And then I have to finish it up with a song.  End of 40, Thieves.  So what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Because we know you, man.  You like to punch us, you know, the establishment in the face.  What do you mean by that?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  Because the whole point is that I hate political correctness. 
[01:25:30]  Look at my girlfriend, all right?  That's not politically correct.  She gets stopped.  No, listen.  She gets pulled over to do the security check every single time we're at the airport.  Really?  Yeah.  Now, she's blonde, blue-eyed, six foot tall.  She's like the American perfect beauty.  I have no idea what she's doing with the little beaner midget like me.  Let's just get that out of the way.  If you guys want to, if you guys want, if anybody in the country wants to realize and  know how funny Carlos Mencia is, you just look at my woman there. 
[01:26:00]  You can say, oh, this dude is hilarious, man.  He's got to be really funny.  You know what's funny?  That when I say stuff like that, she gets really hurt.  I see it.  Because she says that.  I see it in her eyes right now.  See, look at that.  She says that if I was a gardener working out of East L.A., that she still would love  me exactly the same.  Am I right, babe?  Absolutely.  I had no idea who you were and what you did when I met you.  Wow.  See how serious she gets, bro?  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, my girlfriend said the same thing, and I believe her. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, God.  Hey, dude.  I don't believe her, bro.  I just bought her a house and a Mercedes, bro.  I don't believe her.  I don't believe her.  I get her hurt again.  It's all right, man.  You know what, though?  I know where you were going with the security and stuff at the airports.  Right.  We need, I'm sorry, racial profiling at the goddamn airport.  It's not racial profiling.  It's just called, you know, people that look like you do this a lot.  Can we call it that?  Can we call it that?  I mean, why is it that she needs, and you know why they do it? 
[01:27:00]  Right, because when Ahmed gets pissed off and says, why are you doing this to me?  He can look to her and say, oh, you're doing it to everybody.  We don't have to do it to everybody.  And by the way, like Middle Eastern people, cry to somebody else.  Stop crying at me.  I don't want to hear your racial profiling pissed off bit.  I'm tired of it.  I swear to God, cry to white people.  They'll feel sorry for you.  Don't cry to brothers and beaners.  We are the last people that want to hear your crap.  You don't understand they are looking at us funny because of the way we look.  Welcome to the club, bitch. 
[01:27:30]  Thank you.  That's what we've been crying about for years.  Your dumb ass gets racially profiled for three months, and you're having a hissy fit.  Your turbans and, you know, I'm threatening the turbine.  I'm leaving.  What's wrong with you?  They went right to the top of the chart.  Exactly.  I'm happy, man.  For the first time, I can steal stuff at Kmart, and nobody follows me anymore.  It's not a big deal.  Nobody cares.  You guys got kicked down a couple notches.  It must feel good, right?  Dude, it feels awesome, man.  White people look at me.  Hey, you know you're one of us, right?  You know you're one of us.  A lot safer on the subways now because that's... 
[01:28:00]  Right?  Because you're not looking out for us.  Not at all, man.  I'm telling you, and that's true because I have immigrant family, right, that, you know,  that didn't ever made it, that they're illegal, they don't have papers.  They're showing up to my house in bigger droves than ever before.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I was like, what?  I thought they clamped down the borders, and they're like, oh, no, they're not looking  for us.  Oh, man.  They're like, what's your name?  Ramon.  Go ahead, boy.  We ain't looking for you.  We're looking for a hook.  That's who we're looking for.  But I'd be pissed about us.  I mean, you know, my name's Carlos, but if I was a real illegal alien, I would be pissed. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Definitely.  Well, because I'd be pissed at white people.  I'd be looking at white people saying, that's what you get.  That's your problem.  You were at the borders looking for the brown guy, but you're looking for the brown guy.  You were stopping the brown guy from coming in the country.  What kind of danger do I present?  Oh, he just might come over the border and cut my grass.  Don't let him do it.  Pick some cabbage.  Don't let him do it.  He's going to knock on my door and go, housekeeping, you better watch out. 
[01:29:00]  You're not coming over here to go to college.  Exactly.  Come on, man.  That's the dangerous people, the people that have cash from somewhere, no one knows where  they got this cash, that they could take lessons in flight simulators.  That cost thousands of dollars and tell the people they don't know how to take off or  land and they don't care.  They just want to fly.  And meanwhile, people aren't looking at that.  That's my point.  Watch out.  That grist.  What are you worried about, that I'm going to learn how to fly?  I don't have money to fly. 
[01:29:30]  I can't learn how to fly.  I have to walk across the border.  If I had a car, maybe I could run across.  But I don't have any car.  Listen to me, white people.  I never blow anything up.  Okay, one time.  But I told him I'm not an electrician.  My point is, now you're looking for the sleeper.  Where's the sleeper?  You don't have to look for Ramon.  I'm at Home Depot.  You know where I am.  I've got to interrupt for one second.  Oh, go ahead, man.  Because this guy only has limited time.  It's Steve Garland.  He's the program director of KXOA in Sacramento. 
[01:30:00]  You want to explain to the people just tuning in?  We think there's some kind of conspiracy thing happening, right?  Well, yeah, there's something going on.  We were looking at Sacramento's pictures.  In the Naughty Naughty.  In the Naughty Naughty contest.  And they are by far some of the best quality of photographs I've ever seen.  No red eye.  It looks like these are perfect lighting.  I said these are like the page one shot of the Playboy spreads where they still have a little bit of clothes on.  The quality, the lighting.  Look, it's golden lighting on there. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, it's golden.  The lighting's on the back of her butt right there on that last one.  Look at that one.  Look at that, yeah.  Yeah, on that one, it's coming up from the top, shining down on her butt, casting a shadow.  So we're thinking KXOA hired a professional photographer and equipment.  Someone called us and said they could see a strobe light in there.  Yeah, like right here, there's a light being faced up.  And someone knows what they're doing.  The plant's strategically placed in the background.  Yes.  What's up, Steve?  Well, you know, I've got to tell you, I think our conference room has some of the best butt lighting out of all the infinity stations. 
[01:31:00]  It's not a ringer, though.  I swear to God.  Really?  Your pictures look so much nicer than any other city.  Well, you know what's really funny?  If you take a look at the photos, you guys are talking about number 72, which is Anna, right?  Yeah.  Anna rocks.  Oh, hey, Anna is hot.  And Natalie, number 34, the one that I think, didn't you say last week that if you look close enough, you could see what you had for lunch?  Yeah, we said that.  Oh, there's this shot.  Yeah.  Oh, hey there.  Oh, hey. 
[01:31:30]  The fourth one down is...  I see dinner.  Amazing.  I think she had chorizo and eggs for dinner.  That's a security checkpoint.  Yeah.  Well, now, all these...  See, this is why when you guys come to KXOA for the one-year anniversary in July, we'll take you to the room, and I'll show you.  That's where we have our conferences, that same table.  Yeah, but you don't need good lighting for a conference, do you?  No, you don't, but that's done by our webmaster, Leon.  He is truly a webmaster. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  And you've got some professionals in the contest, my friend.  Some people claiming they're porn stars.  No.  If they were, they'd be on Kid Chris' show more often.  Oh, look at you plugging your webmaster.  Hey, you know what?  You are.  I'm good at this.  You are.  And by coincidence, I got Kid Chris sitting right here.  Anna was on his show just last night.  Well, Anna rocks.  Anna, I swear to God, you want to put him on the phone, he'll prove it to you.  These are not pros, dude.  Anna was this one.  Yeah, I guess we have to believe you, man. 
[01:32:30]  We've got to trust you.  We're not stacking the deck.  We're just, Sacramento is full of O&A hotties.  I'm telling you.  You only have three girls represented, and they're all beautiful.  They are, and we're not, I swear to God, we're not setting up lighting.  It's just the best, the best butt lighting in the entire country for a conference room.  Yeah, sure.  There's some guy at home going, oh yeah, that's what happened.  I know, you told me, go get the light bulbs with the hot thing and put them up there.  Go to Home Depot and get the 2,000 watt one.  That's what happened. 
[01:33:00]  This guy's great, man, you know.  Listen to him laughing, bro.  I'm telling you, that's what he did.  There's some guy, he's a photographer.  I used to be a photographer in Mexico.  Please give me the camera.  I shine a light on her ass.  You look great.  Come on.  I used to work at Kmart.  You know, I'm going to upgrade you to cut my lawn every week, dude.  Wow.  That's beautiful.  And he'll bring over a crate of oranges for you.  Exactly.  I need a little light work on my Chevy, too.  Can you handle that? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, beautiful, man.  As long as you let me paint a picture of the Virgin Mary Guadalupe on your hood.  Only if it's in black velvet.  All right, Steve, we got to let you go, all right, man?  All right, you guys rock, man.  We love you in Sacramento.  KXOA.  Thank you.  Thanks, Steve.  Bye.  Second, were you guys going to SAC?  I guess.  We just found out.  One of these days.  We're just trying to throw a little one-year party for us.  SAC is cool, man.  SAC is a really cool town.  You know, they are doing a calendar over there, aren't they?  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, and I'm looking at some of the pictures. 
[01:34:00]  I'm thinking there might be leftover pictures from the calendar contest they did.  Interesting, you think?  More pictures up on opiananthony.com.  A couple more girls from Cleveland.  I think the girl from New York, her pictures are up already?  Yeah, we will in a second.  Hold on.  Got to check in once again with Psycho Tim.  Carl, Psycho Tim's in Boston.  Very hammered because, you know, they're celebrating the Pats victory there.  Oh, beautiful.  Yeah!  What's up, boys?  He's been calling in all day. 
[01:34:30]  He's hammered.  You all right?  Thank God.  For some reason, BCN actually accepts me in their places.  They get me to the VIP room, and I just got hammered again.  He sounds just like Mark now.  Holy S. Do you have a translator?  I have no idea.  The translator says, I'm the world championships.  That's what it is.  Hey, New York, we're world champions.  Champions.  World.  World champions.  Oh, my God.  We are.  We are.  I'm the world championships.  You are snot.  We're a champion. 
[01:35:00]  We're a champion.  Here's what happens when Boston finally wins some kind of a championship.  And this is, Psycho Tim is a great indicator of what the entire city is like right now.  Drunk.  I have not touched one person today, though, Anthony, yet.  Hey, Tim, how about a little space in between the words?  Just a little.  Space.  A little space in between each word. 
[01:35:30]  I have not punched anybody in the face today, yet.  Give him an hour.  I have not been arrested today, yet.  He hasn't punched anybody in the face, yet.  That's what he said, yeah.  And he's saying that with pride, like he normally does.  Well, there's something that I have to be quick and brief, but Mayor Manito didn't show up today for the...  He's slurring like Kirk Douglas.  He didn't show up for the episode.  That is wrong.  That is wrong, man.  I killed you.  You're saying this to me. 
[01:36:00]  Well, I was just bonkers.  Listen, Anthony, I'll kick your ass.  I'll send my son Michael to go over there and turn on your ass.  It's like the Crypt Keeper now.  Hey, Tim.  Yeah, you know what the funny thing is, guys?  What?  I'm on 93 salt doing 85 miles out of my new truck.  Are you driving?  No.  Do you want to put some feedback?  Do you want to put some feedback or...  Thank God the Boston PD is so corrupt that you'll probably know somebody and they'll let you off. 
[01:36:30]  I'll tell you about it that they leave the booby bar there.  What?  Something about a booby bar.  I don't even know what the hell he's saying.  Thank you, Tim.  Good night, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  He said it like Elvis.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Could you turn up my computer? 
[01:37:00]  I've just got a little treat for the fine folks in Boston.  Why would you do this to them today?  No, just to make them feel a little better about their victory.  Feel good about yourselves.  Right.  So the winning run is at second base with two outs.  Three and two to Lukey Wilton.  Little roller up along first.  Behind the bag.  It gets through Buckner.  Here comes Knight.  Buckner's win.  I don't remember.  That was 86. 
[01:37:30]  Why would you do that to them today?  I just love when Buckner misses that because no matter how many times I watch it, he always  seems to miss it.  He misses it again.  He misses it goofy.  Yeah.  Behind the bag.  Oh, Buckner.  It gets by Buckner.  This is when he walks like a penguin toward the bag, right?  But that's one of those guys, you know what I mean, that had been playing baseball just  like five, six, ten years too long.  It was just, you know what I mean?  He couldn't bend over to pick up the ball.  Well, as everyone knows in Boston, he actually was a very good player. 
[01:38:00]  Did a lot of things, but that, well.  But the Pats won.  Come on.  Who am I to take away from there?  He makes that play.  He's in the Hall of Fame, my friend.  Who am I?  Hey, Carl, is it true you got beat up by a retard?  I didn't get beat up by a retard.  I just got verbally bitch slapped by a retard.  A real?  A real handicapped guy.  All right.  I'll tell you the story.  So, all right.  There's this jack-in-the-box, all right? 
[01:38:30]  It's in Austin.  It's on the corner of Anderson Lane and Burnett.  Oh, local reference because we're in Austin now.  Jesus.  Our first local reference for Austin.  Wow.  And you guys are in Austin now?  Yeah, thank you.  Oh, no crap.  Awesome, man.  What station are you guys on in Austin?  A good one?  Yeah, beautiful.  The douche?  A radio station.  The juice.  Sweet.  All right.  Well, anyway, so I'm there in Austin, and I walk up, and there's this guy behind the  counter, and he's kind of like handicapped looking.  He's got a hunch.  Handicapped looking. 
[01:39:00]  Well, you know, he looked really, he looked like he was going to walk up and go, I'm sorry.  We took it over, you know what I mean?  It's looked bad.  Right.  So he walks up to me, and I just, I'm looking at this guy walk with a hunch, and I guess  I couldn't hear him.  My whole brain just was like, oh, my God, this is so not cool.  So I guess the guy said, may I take your order?  But I didn't really hear it.  I just assumed that he said it, and then I said, can I have a number one? 
[01:39:30]  And then he goes, what, are you retarded or something?  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  And the talking to a retarded guy talk.  Yeah.  And then, you know, so he gets pissed, and I'm just like, you know, and he doesn't sound  retarded.  He's like, dude, look at you.  You know, so he's like pissed, like, I'm not retarded.  Why, are you retarded?  You know, and then my brother's there, so my brother's like, yeah, he is retarded.  I get old.  So now they're both bagging on me, and I'm just feeling like crap.  So I'm like, dude, I'm sorry.  I apologize, man.  It's my bad.  You know, I'll have a number two.  And then he goes, well, you have to drink. 
[01:40:00]  And I go, I don't know.  I guess I'll have a Coke.  Right?  And then he goes, well, then I guess I'm going to give you a Dr. Pepper.  Oh, because now he's making a joke like retarded.  Yeah, so now I'm like, well, what are you talking about?  I just asked for a Coke.  And then he goes, no, you didn't.  You said you guessed, and you guessed wrong.  I'm just like, am I getting bagged on by a retard?  Do you have any idea who I am?  You little, I will push your ass all the way to the street.  And then, and then, of course, he knew who I was.  So he's like, come on, I got you, Carlos. 
[01:40:30]  You said you're supposed to laugh.  So now we're friends and stuff.  And, you know, so now when I go through the drive-thru, if you ever go there and you hear this guy,  and it's the funniest thing, because this is really weird.  When you go through the drive-thru, he sounds perfect.  Yeah.  Perfect.  Welcome, welcome to Jack in the Box.  Can I take your order?  When you go there, I swear to God, this is his real voice.  I swear to God, dude, it is the weird, it totally fixes his voice.  What are you going to Jack in the Box? 
[01:41:00]  To Jack in the Box?  Who goes to Jack in the Box anymore?  That's where they go for lunch.  They.  They.  That's what I'm trying to say.  You're looking for Ahmed, you can find him.  You know I'm at Jack in the Box.  That's my point.  I haven't been to Jack in the Box since.  Oh, Derry, do you.  I don't even remember.  I don't even know where one would be.  Do they even have them out here?  I don't know.  Oh, Derry, do you go to Jack in the Box?  Back in the days.  See?  Yeah.  There you go.  See, the cool thing about Jack in the Box is that they have, like, it's not just burgers.  They have all kinds of different. 
[01:41:30]  And it's open 24 hours.  Yeah, that was always good, because I remember getting the breakfast jack at four in the  morning after a night, just tearing it up with my friends.  Okay, so you're in Austin, and there's two places to go.  A place called Taco Cabana, which is fast food Mexican.  Yeah.  Which will definitely give you, you know.  Oh, yeah.  You'll be a salad shooter.  Exactly.  Or you go to Jack in the Box, and you get a Jumbo Jack with cheese.  Where are you going?  Yeah.  You know?  I hear you.  All right, Jack in the Box.  Well, they don't have them anymore. 
[01:42:00]  I always hated the tacos, though.  It was like it was, like, you open it up, it looked like the filling of a baby's diaper.  Sitting in that taco, that soggy taco shell.  Dude, I love that stuff.  I still eat them.  The super taco, and you open them up, and they still look like baby crap, bro.  It's like space food inside.  You just squish it out.  Ugh.  But this handicapped kid, his name is Ron.  And if anybody wants to mess with Ron, this is what you do.  And I do it all the time.  You go to that Jack in the Box, and you order regular fries.  And then when he gives you a total, you say, you know what?  I'm so sorry. 
[01:42:30]  I want something else.  And then you ask for a number two with onion rings and a Dr. Pepper.  And then when he does it again, say, you know what?  I am so sorry.  I changed my mind.  And keep doing it, because then he's going to get pissed at you, because he's going to  think it's me.  Because that's what happened the last time I did it.  And he got pissed, and he was like, Carlos Alamos got fired.  I thought it was you the other day.  They chased her order, and I told him to get the half out of the line.  Is he retarded or not?  No, he's not, but he sounds like that.  He sounds goofy, man.  Yeah, because I noticed I got some of the best service from the retarded.  You know what's funny? 
[01:43:00]  You're right.  I was at Burger King over there in Huntington.  But from real handicapped people.  I'm talking, yeah, I'm talking Special Olympics.  Cerebral palsy, yeah.  Running in the Special Olympics.  You're not talking about people that were born like us, but now are pissed off because  they've got a crappy job, and they're like, how come I got to work at McDonald's?  Exactly.  Not the people that you work with that you call retarded.  Exactly.  So I walk in there, and I see this girl.  She's got Down syndrome.  Walks up.  And, man, she didn't miss a beat.  Like Rain Man.  She knew to take the order.  She knew what buttons to hit. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  She came back with it.  No attitude.  No attitude.  No attitude.  No bulldog.  Because they're happy.  No yapping to their friend.  Because the worst thing is when I go into a goddamn McDonald's or a Burger King,  and it's like, may I help you?  And I said, I go, oh, gee.  And then she's talking, girlfriend, let me tell you something.  I will pull that weave out your head.  With her big nails.  Yeah, with the big nails.  She can't work the register.  And God forbid you say something.  This is one of the pain in the asses of being a white guy.  I got to tell you, because you cannot tell that bitch.  Hey, shake your big ass.  Yes, you can.  No.  Yes, you can. 
[01:44:00]  You telling me.  Let me tell you something, mother.  And you are something.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  That's one of the things.  That's one of the things that pisses me off.  Seventy percent of the people in America are white.  You are the majority.  And you guys act like you're the minority.  They always complaining about something.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't understand.  Listen, if I get crappy service, I wish I was white.  I wish I was white and I went to a fast food joint and I got crappy service.  And somebody was like, oh, you just want me to get your stuff because I'm black. 
[01:44:30]  I'd be like, no.  It's because I'm at Burger King and you're behind the comm and you got the little tag.  That says, you don't work here, you dumb whore.  It has nothing to do with the fact that you're black.  I didn't ask you for Kool-Aid and a watermelon.  I asked you for a damn burger, man.  Jesus.  Ring the bell.  That's good.  No, it just bugs me, man.  It's like, get over yourselves.  White people very afraid of being tagged the racist. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, but that.  Once you're tagged.  No, but the thing is, blacks will exploit the crap out of that.  Like you said, yeah, I expected service because I came into Burger King and you're wearing the tag.  But the second you make a little bit of a complaint or something like that, all of a sudden it's like, well, it's because I'm black.  But it's because we let them get away with it.  It's like what we were talking about earlier.  My girlfriend at the line and Ahmed saying, why are you pulling me over?  Let me work security.  I will say, listen, brothers, spics, crackers, retards, and midgets, come over here. 
[01:45:30]  Everybody else, name, get your edge to the wall, okay?  Why are you checking me?  Because somebody that looked like you recently blew up our buildings.  Right, right.  If you got, I don't know, you got some guy, Tyrone Johnson, flies into a building, they're in the blacks a lot.  Exactly.  He pulled over to the side.  Look, if we're worried about people blowing up planes, Ahmed, you got up against the wall.  If we're worried about, yo, check it, but after McVeigh blew up Oklahoma, the building over there, the bottom skinhead white boys out there. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, no, they absolutely do.  Those militias and stuff in the Midwest.  Oh, hell yeah.  They unloaded on them.  The thing is, you never heard a complaint.  Stay in a game too long when they were 28 points over, and he got hurt.  When was that last?  And then they gave him a cortisone shot yesterday, and he looked sluggish, and he didn't play well.  But that's just because the guy was hurt.  He was playing high.  He was playing, you know, he was on cortisone, bro.  They jacked him up.  He was on the numb side.  Yeah.  He had an injury, and they jacked him up. 
[01:46:30]  You're right.  Minorities always complain about stuff.  And so, listen, have you guys ever heard me complain about being Hispanic in the business?  You're Hispanic?  How did they teach you in the business?  But you know what I'm saying?  Listen, I'm the only non-white to get a standing ovation on Def Jam.  I'm the only person to ever get a standing ovation on The Tonight Show since Jay Leno took over.  Are you trying to say that we need to give you a standing ovation when you leave today?  No, listen, what I'm saying is I could probably argue that if I was black, I'd be Chris Rock,  and if I was white, I'd be Sam Kenison. 
[01:47:00]  But I'm not, so I'm Carlos Mencia.  But, you know, so what?  You're a beaner.  I'm a beaner, and that's it.  And there's no wrong with that, and you move on.  All you got to shoot for is like...  No, I'm not a Mexican, dude.  Where are you from?  I'm not a Mexican.  All you got to shoot for is like Paul Rodriguez or something?  Well, I think I already passed that.  Hopefully.  Jesus.  Hopefully, bro.  Why are you dissing Paul Rodriguez?  Hopefully.  What do you mean I'm not dissing him?  I'll open a door for you, my brother.  Hey, I'll say it.  This guy is ten times funnier.  No doubt.  No doubt.  Well, man, who's the problem?  I love Paul.  All right, all right.  I look up to Paul from a business perspective, from our business. 
[01:47:30]  He opened doors, but as a person, he's an ass.  Where are you from, yo?  You from a man?  No, I'm not Colombian.  I'm an American, bro.  Come on.  No, but why don't you have your parents for, my brother?  No, I'm not.  What are you?  I'm Dominican.  No, you're not Dominican.  You're an American.  No, I'm Dominican.  See, this is the kind of crap that separates America.  I'm Dominican.  So then when I go to apply for a job, there wouldn't be a little box saying, why Hispanic,  Indian, or faggot? 
[01:48:00]  You don't have to answer that.  I'm faggot.  You don't have to answer that.  There's a faggot box.  There's a box that says other.  Faggot's getting mad right, Seth.  No, dude.  You put other.  What part of the Dominican Republic do you live in?  I didn't know there was a faggot box.  I'm Santiago, kid.  You live here, bro.  In New York.  I love it here.  That's my point.  I love it.  You got a girlfriend?  Oh, hell yeah.  You got an ex-girlfriend?  Yeah.  All right.  Tell your girlfriend that your ex-girlfriend gave better Hummers and see what happens.  I ain't going to get no more.  Exactly, and that's what we do to America.  We leave crappy countries that suck ass to come here, and then we come here and go, 
[01:48:30]  but over there, you don't understand.  You know, I'm tired of that.  I'm tired of my family coming over.  Man, in Honduras and Mexico, it kicks ass.  When are you going back?  I'm not moving over there to shut your ass off.  Hallelujah.  Stop crying for Christ's sake.  That's true.  But I'm just, you can't say any of this stuff, though.  You know, people get all hurt, and it's not right, and it's not sensitive.  You're not sensitive. 
[01:49:00]  People take it as pride in where they come from, which is one thing, but when you take  it to the level of, I'm this or that, no, you're a goddamn American.  Yeah.  I'm a Mexican.  Yeah.  Aren't you in the Marines?  Aren't you going to war right now?  Yeah.  I'm having you with the Mexican army.  Yeah.  You're not flying.  When they tell you to jump out, they're not going to be, orale, pues, brinca!  That's not what you're going to hear before you jump out of that plane, bro.  Trust me.  People are goofy.  I don't know.  Just give people freedom of speech. 
[01:49:30]  That's all I'm saying.  It hurts less than bombs.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  I don't want anybody to beat Middle Eastern people, and I don't either, but don't I have  the right to just give them a crappy look?  Well, some people, well, Dominican, like that, like he's very proud of his Dominican heritage.  I don't walk around waving a flag.  No, but that's because he gets hissed by the Puerto Ricans.  African-Americans.  African-Americans freak out.  But what they claim is that we didn't choose to come here.  So that's like what their selling point is of why they still want to be considered African. 
[01:50:00]  But you know something?  You want to pick a horrible Petri dish of a place on this world.  Man.  Africa.  You know something?  Yeah.  Every culture went through some pretty crappy times when they left their homeland to come here,  regardless of if they were selling it, the boat themselves, or in storage.  But you know something?  You know what I'm saying?  You're here now.  You got here.  And you do not want to be back in the country that you came from.  Carl's has a great bit on that.  Yeah, but do you want to hear something that's sad?  Do the short version of that. 
[01:50:30]  No, no, no.  I don't think I'm going to do.  But what's sad is, my black friend was getting on me about slavery.  And I was like, you know, I'm sorry that it happened, but I'm glad that you're here.  And he was just tripping and getting mad.  And he pushed me to the point where I was like, well, bro, have you read your history book?  Do you realize that the pyramids were built by slaves that black people owned for thousands of years?  You cry about 400 years of oppression.  You oppressed the Jews for thousands of years.  And he was like, what? 
[01:51:00]  And I said, what?  Yeah, I said, payback's a bitch, ain't it, brother?  He just shut up after that.  He just shut up.  He's like, oh, damn, this brother know how to read.  Listen, and they tried to make Mexicans, well, not Mexicans at the time, Aztecs and Mayans, Incas, slaves before the black people.  I mean, we were already here.  We were dark.  You know, it was ripe for the picking.  You know what I mean?  They were like, you're going to work for us for free.  We were like, we don't even work for us, bro.  That's not going to work out. 
[01:51:30]  That idea is not going to pan out, my brother.  I'd rather vanish from the face of the earth as a culture.  But he's talking about is African-Americans and Mexican-Americans and all this hyphenated American stuff.  You got kids that are like, I'm Italian.  Do you speak Italian?  You know, they know how to say afungul or something like that, and that's it.  You know what I mean?  Or you got, you know, you got a Mexican, you know what I mean?  I'm a real Mexican.  Where are you from?  Arizona.  You know what I'm saying?  What part of Mexico are you from?  Arizona.  You know what I mean?  I'm from that new Mexico. 
[01:52:00]  Exactly.  I'm from Albuquerque.  No Mexico.  That's that new Mexico.  You know, then you're like, when are you going to go back to Mexico?  Dude, back.  I've never even been there.  Yeah, of course.  Come on.  But my whole point is that there is no real hyphenation.  You know what I mean?  That's crap.  People try to feed me that all the time.  You're Mexican-American.  You're half and half.  And I'm like, why is it that on April 15th the government takes all my money?  Yeah, they don't take half.  Where's my half?  Where's my Mexican A?  You know, here's your half and a half. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  And here's what I say to especially African-Americans.  You're black and you're American.  And I'm telling you this, and I speak Spanish.  I speak perfect Spanish.  And I know the different accents of the different countries.  Like in Mexico, it's like,  Oye, cabrón, tiene tanto tiempo no one need.  And in Central America, it's like,  Puta, wow, no jodas, cerote.  And then in Argentina, it's like,  Oye, chivalen.  And in Cuba or Puerto Rico, it's like,  Oye, coño, pero dale a la binga.  Or in Spain, it's like,  Pero Carlos, es que tú.  So I know what I'm talking about.  I will give any black person born in America, 
[01:53:00]  I will give any of you a ticket to Rwanda right now.  You can go to carlosmencia.com  and leave me an email.  I will buy you a one-way ticket.  The plane will land.  The doors will open up.  They will look at your black ass and go,  And you're going to look at them and be like,  New York in the house.  Brooklyn in the house.  Trust me, bro.  Trust me.  We've all seen the little African kids.  That's why none of us want to go there.  It's just the reality, man. 
[01:53:30]  You look at Somalia.  See, but that's the kind of stuff.  I can't see this stuff.  I can't do this on my special.  They don't want to hear that.  No, that's wrong.  They'll upset some of the advertisers.  We really have to take a quick break.  Carlos, let's see you hang with us today.  No, no problem at all.  Murray wants to say something really fast.  So, Murray.  Yeah, how are you doing?  Murray, what's up, man?  Go real fast.  Carlos, I tell you what you're saying.  Love a mark or leave it.  I agree.  You can't stand the people that come over here  and say how bad it is  and then don't come.  Stay where you're at.  I totally agree. 
[01:54:00]  I ought to stop and give you a hand.  I appreciate it.  Okay, thanks, Murray, for recommending it.  It says I had to pull over  to give Carlos a standing ovation.  No, but see,  here's what people need to understand.  America wants immigrants.  We just want the good ones.  That's all that it's all about.  Hey, what country wants the bad ones?  Right, you know,  and here's a law for people  that don't understand it.  Like, if the Middle Eastern people  get pissed at me,  but you're already here.  How could you be mad  and say,  and I should feel sorry 
[01:54:30]  for people that live in the Middle East  when you were in the Middle East  and you're here?  That means they could get here.  I mean, are you the special one?  Did you rub a lamp?  Is that how you got here?  Did you find a little carpet  that flew your ass here?  No, here's what happened.  You were over there  and all your friends were crying.  It sucks here.  It is hot.  I pray to Allah  and he doesn't give.  And you said,  you know what?  Allah doesn't give good reception  in this area.  I think I will learn how to drive cab  and pray in New York  for things happen much better than them.  That's what happened.  It's really that simple. 
[01:55:00]  Little starving African kids  with flies everywhere,  they're lazy.  They could have built bolts  and got here like the rest of us.  I'm not sending them any money.  You know,  you see them with the flies  and they don't even go like this.  Come on,  we need fly swatters  in this country.  Go to Mexico.  There's those boatloads  of starving kids  where when flies come around  they do this  and they sell chiclets to you.  You see what I'm saying?  This is what I'm talking about.  But people don't go,  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  You know,  move.  If where you live sucks,  if you live in a place 
[01:55:30]  like Afghanistan  where it's brown,  sandy,  crappy,  no water,  no vegetation,  even the camels  have this look like,  man,  I got to get the hill  out of here.  Move,  you dumbass.  It's just like idiots  in Tornado Alley.  And by the way,  this is for all the Ahmeds  that think,  oh,  you're just speaking or not.  I feel the same way  about Ahmed  that I do about Bubba  in Tornado Alley  crying every year.  We got hit by a ternighter again.  Well,  of course you did,  dumbass.  You live in Tornado Alley. 
[01:56:00]  It means they're,  you don't hear bowling pins  talking about,  damn,  there's another ball  coming my way.  No,  you recall.  Move,  you jackass.  It's not even that difficult  for you to move.  your house has wheels  for Christ's sake.  Just drive.  Drive.  Drive.  We're going to rebuild.  I always say that.  Like they're digging  through the rubble,  they find a picture frame,  and the big fat woman  with the bleach blonde hair  is crying.  Don't worry. 
[01:56:30]  We're going to rebuild  right here.  Oh,  no,  I heard it.  I was in Tulsa,  Oklahoma after a hurricane,  and I did that joke,  and some guy was like,  it's all right.  We're going to rebuild.  Just like,  what an ass.  And these are the idiots  that say things like,  man,  those black people,  they just don't know  how to spoke  the English right.  These are people  that put an R  at the end of tornado.  All right,  we got a break.  Tornader.  They're killing us.  We got a break.  Yeah.  Going all the way back  to the retard  at the fast food restaurant, 
[01:57:00]  something we were playing  around the holiday at.  What is it?  Ding fries are done.  Oh!  Little ditty.  Check this out.  Okay.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
[01:57:30]  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Where is the bell?  Wait for the bell.  Can you hear the bell?  Where is the bell?  Ding-a-da-don.  Ding-a-da-don.  Ding-a-da-don.  Ding-a-da-don.  I was a book of 好き, making favorite whoppers.  I would pay for hats.  Would you like a napου pie with that?  Would you like a nap загому pie with that?  Ding-a-da-don.  Ding-a-da-don. 
[01:58:00]  Ding-a-da-don.  Ding-a-da-don.  Finally, finally, finally, the ultimate degenerates meet the ultimate decadence.  This Friday, the Opie and Anthony Show broadcasts live from Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And EW.  Yo, yo.  Yo.  Yeah, you're using a black man's music to promote a show with two crackers. 
[01:58:30]  Yo, yo.  I'm also capping your ass if you turn my mic off.  Oh, shut up, old dirty.  It makes me get Frenchy on the phone.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Carlos Mencia in studio today.  A lot of people want to know where you're playing tonight, Carlos.  You're not, right?  I'm not.  You flew in just to do the Comedy Central special.  I meant to be on your show.  You should have booked the room, bro.  No, that's cool.  We'll do it next time.  It's no big deal, man.  He's hilarious.  It's all good.  Hilarious.  You guys can actually, I don't know what the number is, but you guys can actually try to 
[01:59:00]  come to the tapings tomorrow.  It's going to be me, Richard, Jenny, and who's the other person on the show?  I don't know.  Anyway, it's me and Richard Jenny and somebody else are doing like specials back to back.  Ah.  Yeah.  Richard Jenny.  We like Richard Jenny.  We've had him on the show.  We love him.  We almost had a brawl.  It's all.  No.  It was fun.  Let the guy be. 
[01:59:30]  Am I smelling sarcasm?  No.  No.  We had a little problem.  Hey, look at this ridiculous.  And I might have overreacted.  Uh-oh.  Look at this ridiculous political correct story here.  The International Olympic Committee decided that the American flag that was found in the  rubble of the World Trade Center and flew with the Super Bowl and World Series and whatnot  cannot be represented at Friday's Winter Olympic opening ceremonies.  The American delegation was going to use that flag as the American flag when they parade  all the different countries around. 
[02:00:00]  But the head of the International Olympic Committee said the flag was too political.  What does that mean?  It means he doesn't want to offend other countries that we are blaming for terrorism  and whatnot for using this.  That's all I can think.  What could be too political?  But people from over like 150 countries died in the World Trade Center.  So it would represent everyone.  You know what I mean?  You're thinking too much.  They're all dirty.  Why on earth would they deem it too political? 
[02:00:30]  It happened.  You know?  That IOC is full of crap anyway.  Ain't they homosexual scandals?  Something like that.  Homosexual scandals.  There's scandals and conspiracies with everything.  There was a conspiracy, but it had nothing to do with homosexuality, bro.  It had to do with payoffs.  That's what it was.  The original Olympics, they did wrestle naked, man.  So I don't know, Alderian.  Might have something.  Might be going down that route.  Might be down that route.  Oh, wow.  This guy is very pissed off at you from Afghanistan. 
[02:01:00]  Posey.  Beautiful.  Posey.  Yeah.  What's up?  Not much.  Where are you from?  I think we've talked to you before, right?  Yes, you have.  Posey.  Listen, who the hell this guy is?  Oh, it's Nagi.  Are you Nagi?  No, I'm not.  Oh.  Because we had a Nagi call once.  You're not Noogie.  I thought it was Nagi.  You're Posey?  Yeah, listen.  Yes.  Yes.  Who the hell is this guy?  Anyways, why?  He's going to get his ass kicked.  I'm going to get my ass kicked. 
[02:01:30]  By who?  You should be glad.  I'm telling people not to beat Middle Eastern people.  You're getting mad at me.  All I'm saying is use some words.  No, listen.  I'm not getting mad at you.  I'm not.  And who's going to kick my ass?  Listen, you're telling the truth.  We should be happy that we are here, but you're saying Afghanistan such and such.  You don't know anything about Afghanistan.  Afghanistan is a horrible place.  It's a horrible place.  All I'm saying is it's a horrible, wretched place to live.  Am I wrong?  Anthony, where are you from originally?  I am originally from Long Island.  No.  Where are you, like, two generations ago? 
[02:02:00]  What, two generations?  I'm from a horrible place.  I would never go.  Italy.  It just looks dirty, and I would never want to go to Italy.  Hey, what are you saying about my thigh?  No, I enjoy modern convenience.  When I go to a hotel, I don't want a classic Italian old hotel with the one bathroom that  people share.  I don't know.  I want modern convenience that are here in America.  I agree, but I'll tell you one thing.  I go farther than you.  I want the handicapped one with the rails and everything.  Hey, Posey, Afghanistan is a horrible country. 
[02:02:30]  It is not.  Oh, my God.  Then why are you here?  Why are you here?  Listen, Afghanistan is a horrible country.  You ask the American troops once they come back, God be willing.  You ask them, Afghanistan is a terrible country.  It's a wonderful country.  All right, but why is everybody complaining then?  We had war.  We got out.  I'm happy.  See?  I'm one of those.  A lot of Africans are going back.  I'm one of those people that is not going back.  I'm staying.  Why? 
[02:03:00]  I'm staying because I like it here.  You like to live in America.  So do you like it better here than Afghanistan?  I do.  Is it true that it is an impoverished country?  What?  It's an impoverished country.  What does that mean?  They're in poverty.  Most of the people are poor.  They don't even have a major export.  Anthony, check this out.  What?  Listen, Afghanistan has had war for 22 years.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why it's a crappy country.  I'm not saying there isn't a reason it's a crappy country. 
[02:03:30]  It's a crappy country.  No, it's not.  But Afghanistan was one of the biggest tourist attractions before the war.  People would go from all over the world to see Afghanistan.  Yeah, except now.  Wait, what would they see in Afghanistan?  We have...  What would they see?  Yeah, is there like a Disney World there or something?  No.  What?  They had those statues that they got blown up.  Yeah, they had those statues and stuff that got blown up.  They got blown up.  What was the number one tourist attraction in Afghanistan before the war?  Listen, Afghanistan is as big as Texas, okay? 
[02:04:00]  It's not like...  It's as big as Texas, but...  All right, answer my...  Mexico's bigger than Texas.  Answer my question, though.  It doesn't make it a great place.  Okay, you guys are not paying attention.  Yes, I'm listening, Posey.  We are, Posey.  I promise.  Don't get upset, okay?  Don't get upset.  It's okay.  We're not upset.  What would people see if they went there on vacation?  Why were they going to Afghanistan?  Why did they go to the Caribbean?  The burka factory.  Why did they go to the Caribbean?  It is beautiful.  Because it's surrounded by blue, perfect water with coral reefs that you can snorkel in 
[02:04:30]  and see purple fish.  Luxury hotels.  Okay, apply everything minus the water to Afghanistan.  Stop it.  Are you on drugs?  No, I'm not.  You've got to pick up a globe.  You're looking at the wrong side.  I'm not.  I grew up there, so I know every...  Is there a Club Med in Afghanistan?  I'm sorry?  Club Dead.  Is there a Club Med?  What the hell is that?  Posey, Posey.  You got Club...  Club Med?  If they got a Club Med, I'm there.  Posey, listen to me.  We got vacation in a month.  I'm there.  Posey, listen to me for a minute. 
[02:05:00]  You guys are crazy, I swear.  I know, we're crazy.  Listen to me.  You're crazy.  Carlos, you be careful because don't play with people's pride on a serious note.  There's proud...  People are proud of Afghanistan.  Listen, I'm pissing Middle Eastern people off.  Who knew they were proud of Afghanistan?  Posey, I think he was defending you guys.  Yeah, and actually, all the Middle Eastern people that are going to be offended...  Carlos, Carlos...  ...already live in America, so they, by choice, are here.  Carlos, listen.  Your accent that you copy Middle Eastern, it's awful. 
[02:05:30]  You sound so awful.  So we're going to spin a little bit.  I apologize.  I will work on my accent.  Posey, it's a horrible, landlocked country.  Copy me if you can.  Horrible.  That's Indian.  That's not even Middle Eastern.  No, that is not true.  The way you copy, that's Middle Eastern.  Oh, no.  That's Indian.  Wait a minute.  This is Indian.  I don't know the difference.  Oh, yes, it is.  The Indian is Indian.  Oh, yes, it is.  And you are mimicking me.  That is one thing I don't know.  That's Indian.  That's not even Middle Eastern.  That's what he said.  It's Indian.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:00]  That's what I said.  All right, Posey.  Posey, we've got to get back to the chuckles, so thank you.  Fine.  Appreciate it.  Dude, didn't she say, that sounds Indian, and then I did the Indian, and she goes, that  doesn't sound...  Yeah.  Whatever.  I've never been there, so I can't judge the damn place.  Look.  Sure you can.  I'll judge it.  You've seen pictures.  Good enough.  Yeah, I'll judge it.  It's a crappy, disgusting, impoverished country where millions are dying of hunger on a daily  basis.  The only tourist attraction in Afghanistan is the Burka factory.  What are you going to go over there for? 
[02:06:30]  It's bombed out, you know.  Burka factory.  What do you make Burka factory in two colors?  Go back to our effing Bronze Age country.  All right, here's another guy that's pissed off at Carlos.  Oh, too pissed off at me.  Carlos giving us all the laughs, and people are pissed out there.  Chris, what's up?  What's your problem today?  Chris, you.  Dude, it's not your guy on the radio.  He's awesome.  He's telling the truth.  Oh, okay.  These freaking idiots, freaking foreigners coming to this country, they're saying, oh,  this country sucks.  I've actually been pulled out of a strip joint in Jersey because I was about to knife this 
[02:07:00]  girl counting the American dollar saying America sucks.  This country is so screwed.  Oh, nice, the girl.  Oh, dude.  I was freaking loaded, man.  You could have just called her a whore, bro.  Exactly.  Dude, he's counting the American dollars saying this country sucks.  These people come here, they want to thrive.  Whatever happened to people coming to this country, making a frigging dollar, is staying  here.  Now, what do they want to do?  Caribbean would suck without the water.  When I go to the Caribbean, I'm not checking out the countryside. 
[02:07:30]  No, I'm there for the beach.  And you know what?  When you do check out the countryside because you have to take that little bus ride, it's  not too pretty.  True.  Yeah.  But the cool thing is, is that when you're on the beach, there's half-maked chicks and  they're beautiful.  Right.  Why would you want to go to Afghanistan and see just veils and unveils?  Because you can smack them with sticks there.  That's an attraction.  This guy Jay makes a really good point about the American flag at the Winter Olympics.  Yeah.  Go ahead, man.  Go ahead.  That is a very good point.  Jay?  Who the hell from the Middle East is going to even be at the Winter Olympics? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  The Iraqis on the sand hockey team there?  The sand hockey team.  The Brady Sand Dunes bobsledders are going to be saying about the flag?  Yeah, they're going to go head-to-head with the Jamaican bobsled team.  I guess they're not going to be representing so.  You guys can't even afford a postcard with snow on it.  All right.  Good job, Jay.  Good job, man.  Hey, listen.  I was born in another country, all right?  And to all the people that are from foreign lands, that were born somewhere else, like myself. 
[02:08:30]  Carlos, those people don't listen to our shows here.  No, there's...  Well, you know what?  Then this is for the people that are listening.  Might as well go to that wall over there.  But you know what?  If they're...  Well, Posey listened.  Yeah, look at her.  Yeah.  Well, so if it's only for Posey, then fine.  Look, America is a badass country that would allow us to come here in the first place.  For it could close off its borders if it wanted to.  But for every person that thinks that you are the sneakiest person and you're able to  get across the border because you have these powers, just remember, they allowed you to 
[02:09:00]  get here because we need somebody to go.  Housekeeping.  That's why you're here.  All right?  And if you don't believe that I'm true when I say this, understand, we live in a country  that can splice a gene.  We live in a country that can invent an atomic weapon that can destroy the inhabitants of  the world over 10,000 times over.  We can go to the moon, go to the edge of our solar system.  We can do some of that cloning, too.  Cloning.  Yeah.  Do you really believe we can do all that, but we can't stop Julio from crossing the  damn border?  Are you serious? 
[02:09:30]  What are they?  MacGyver wetbacks?  Is that what they are?  You dumbass.  They let you in here.  Be happy.  Listen, if I was in Honduras where I was born, I would be talented.  But I wouldn't be on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'd be behind a cow going, plow, puto, plow.  That's what I'd be doing.  And I wouldn't be driving a Mercedes and making two million a year.  All right?  I'd be going, come on, give me more milk.  All right?  So, come on.  Let's just be honest.  It's part of the economy.  It's the unspoken portion of the economy.  Illegal aliens. 
[02:10:00]  It's true.  Because you're not going to find people that are going to do that work.  Who's going to get on your roof when it's windy?  Yeah.  When it's windy and it's covered in ice?  Manuel.  That's it.  And you can't get a Puerto Rican who's already born an American to do that.  No.  Because they're not.  You've got to get a Dominican.  That's who you've got to get.  You've got to.  Seriously.  It's the truth.  You can't get a, hey, man, go up on the roof.  Well, yo, it's windy.  But, you know, if I fall, you know, according to the union rules, you're going to have to pay.  And you're utterly responsible for anything that may happen. 
[02:10:30]  Julio, get your ass up there.  You know?  He's windy.  I'm going to call immigration and ask him how windy it is.  He's snowed out, Wendy.  Back to Mexico.  He's snowed out, Wendy.  You didn't let me finish.  I was going to say it's a little windy.  I need a rope.  That's what I was going to say.  But you didn't let me finish.  Hilarious.  Hey, Cheryl.  Cheryl.  Our Jamaican sister.  Listen to me.  I wanted to talk to that bitch so bad.  Give me a free read then.  You understand?  Yeah.  How can she compare the Caribbean with the animals that live in Afghanistan? 
[02:11:00]  You understand me?  Let me tell you something.  It's a Caribbean pride.  I am from the Caribbean.  I'm from Jamaica.  You guys know that, right?  Yeah.  They are nothing but towels.  And listen to me.  If I had the powers, I'd run every one of them out of the United States tomorrow morning.  Because I have to back the United States.  You understand me?  The United States allow people from the Caribbean to come here and send their kids to colleges.  They can buy houses.  Am I being charged $8.99 a minute for this moment?  Call me now for your free reading.  Listen to me. 
[02:11:30]  That's Posey Nosey or whatever her name was.  Tell her to go back.  See, she likes it so bad here.  Let her go back.  She ain't going back.  She likes it here.  If you guys can't say it because of the FCC, I'm going to say there are nothing but murderers  that live there.  Cheryl, the rice and peas and oxtail on what?  Can I come by the house?  Tell her to wake up because she's sleeping.  You understand me?  She needs to wake up.  There are not much rocks and sands in Afghanistan and murderers and criminals.  Rocks, sands, murderers, and criminals.  Sounds like Coney Island. 
[02:12:00]  I'm so sobbing, you kid.  That's right.  She means the reality check.  Do you understand me?  All right, Cheryl.  Okay, Ben.  And get those towelheaders out of the country.  Thank you, my sister.  Nice and peace.  Oh, and she hung up there.  I will say this, all right?  We're united in hatred.  Yeah.  But I will say this, and this is pretty interesting.  That if you know this, the people that talk smack about America are minorities.  Yeah, okay.  But you know what's funny? 
[02:12:30]  We're never the traitors.  We just talk smack.  You know what I mean?  From Benedict Arnold all the way up until Johnny Walker, there's never been a black, Hispanic,  like, traitor.  Well, we can't get in the CIA.  No, that's not it.  It's because we're just talking smack.  That's all it is.  We're just talking.  You can get the blackest, the blackest, you know, I'm proud.  Brother, man, proud.  You know, when you're going back to Africa, oh, man, I was just talking smack, man.  Damn, can a brother just complain and get a little more cheese?  Jesus Christ.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:13:00]  Get an extra two dollars in my check, dog.  Yeah, exactly.  Damn, man, I just want a little political correct money coming my way, man.  You ain't got to be sending a brother back.  You know what I'm saying?  I need my Medicaid.  You know what I'm saying?  It's the same with Julio.  When you're going back, no, I was just talking smack.  Henchmen.  I'm paying off a house.  I can't leave yet, you know.  This guy says the only way he wants to see Afghanistan is through a bomb site.  Bomb the burka factory.  But see, look how politically correct we are.  Yeah.  We are going, we are at war, right? 
[02:13:30]  We're at war against the country.  Now, in war, in past history, you annihilate the enemy.  Until they stop and say, uncle.  And look at us now.  We're bombing them and dropping food.  What kind of pussy-ass crap is that?  It's got to be politically correct.  You know what I mean?  That's like Democrats and Republicans.  Let's bomb their ass.  Let's kill them all.  You know, Democrats, let's feed them.  Speaking of which, what do you think of John Walker?  Food.  What do you think of John Walker, the traitor, who's being that?  Bomb his ass.  Kill his ass.  He's being indicted today, I believe.  Good, stab his ass.  Punk ass. 
[02:14:00]  I thought they should have brought him back in a body bag.  They should have put him in C-76 on Rikers Island.  But that's what's awesome about America.  You know what I mean?  Dude, any other country, that dude would have been dead.  They would have extracted all the information and shot his ass in the head.  Only in America are we that nice.  Let's do it their way this time around.  I agree.  I agree.  But that's my point.  You can't do stuff like that.  You can't say stuff like that.  Let's take him out back and say he tripped.  People get all hurt.  You know?  You know, you hurt his parents. 
[02:14:30]  Have you ever been to Afghanistan?  No.  I've watched it on CNN.  And trust me, it's not a destination of choice.  You know what I mean?  He's a posy act like people are going, man, if it wasn't for the Edward, holy crap, you  know what I would be.  Come on, man.  Walker's attorney wants to have him released.  On what?  While the trial came out.  I say, I got bail.  You know what, though?  I say release him.  Oh, yeah.  Let's have some fun.  Release him.  Yeah, let him go.  Release him.  Let him go like Jeffrey Dahmer. 
[02:15:00]  You know he was going to get stabbed.  Instead of parading him around the courthouse with the bulletproof vest on, with the guards  and stuff, I'm for it, man.  Let him out.  Let him out.  Yeah, give him bail.  Let someone catch him at a 7-Eleven when I find smokes or something.  The lawyer makes sense in this case.  Let him free.  Yeah.  Let him free.  I agree.  He has so much protection with the bulletproof vest and the big security guard.  Oh, he's in his own cell.  Yeah.  In his own cell.  You know what I'm saying?  Let him go.  They caught the brother out there.  He looked like the Taliban.  He had his long beard and his burka on and all that. 
[02:15:30]  Misguided youth, all dirty.  So it's not like, you know, circumstantial evidence with a paper trail.  We bought you from over there.  Now you want to get out on bail.  Come on, let him out.  Let him out on bail.  Come on.  Let him out on a little bail.  Yes.  But it's this political correctness.  That's what it is.  That kid is a victim of all this pushy America.  That's how it's going to be portrayed.  Let's be nice to everybody.  How do you flip like that, though?  They are going to say that this poor kid, he's the victim of the Taliban.  Just as much as we're victims of the Taliban with what happened here, this man is just another casualty. 
[02:16:00]  This boy, this child is just another casualty of the Taliban.  This poor man.  Why are we going to punish him further now?  Yeah, what do we teach him?  He needs help.  Before you know it, this son of a bitch is on Oprah.  You're right.  Making millions of dollars.  Yes, you are.  Because it's not his fault.  It's not his fault.  No, it's not.  What do we teach him in school?  We teach him to be nice to other people, to give to people that had less.  He went on a humanitarian mission to help these people. 
[02:16:30]  And was then taken hostage or whatever and forced to do this.  This son of a bitch will walk and he will be on every talk show.  Yes.  And Barbara Walters will cream for the first time in a decade to have him.  I am on her show.  Yes.  And he will marry Patty Hearst.  Yeah.  Another friggin' terrorist.  For some reason, she's on comedy set.  I went to the goddamn Hugh Hefner.  I went to the goddamn Hugh Hefner Rose.  She's on the dais.  I look up.  She's on the dais.  Twenty years from now, Bin Laden's going to be going, oh, that was a funny one. 
[02:17:00]  They'll be on the dais.  And Osama Bin Laden.  Yeah.  Sitting here.  There he is.  He's going to be all old for a while.  I thought they were going to catch him.  They will forget Patty Hearst was hooked up with a group that bombed police cars.  And, you know, they were terrorists of their day.  Right.  They were trying to get their point across by killing people and blowing stuff up.  Fortunately, they were inept enough.  They couldn't build a bomb that worked half of the time.  Yeah.  They were like that dude with the C4 in his shoe.  Yeah.  Dumbass.  Richard Reed. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Another dumbass.  Take that for you.  That's how politically correct America is.  If I'm on a plane and some dude tries to kill me, is in the process of murdering everybody in there.  Yeah.  And we have a few hours to kick his ass.  He will die by the time we land.  Why did they bring him alive off that plane?  You know what?  And that's why I fly Southwest.  Southwest, because on Southwest, they will kill your ass.  Shameless plug.  I'm serious.  No, no, no.  Some guy got a little rambunctious one, so they choked him. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  They killed him.  They killed him.  And this was before September 11th.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So that's why.  I'll tell you one thing.  If there was all Latinos in black on those planes, they wouldn't have done a damn thing.  You're going to put out a little razor, and I'm going to be afraid of that?  No.  I'm crazy.  I give it to them, though.  The people of World War 30.  Yeah, I'm serious, man.  Come on, man.  I take, man.  I take, man.  You know, what do you think?  You think you just...  You honestly think...  You don't have a whole guy now with weapons, though.  You know what?  You know what?  I don't go...  Nowadays, you're right. 
[02:18:30]  But then, it's just another thing.  You look at your watch and go, all right, how long is this going to take before they drop  this son of a bitch off in Cuba or wherever the hell he wants to go?  I'm not going to touch him.  We won't do anything.  You're not expecting that.  It didn't have any precedent.  You never saw anything like that.  Nowadays, you pull out a goddamn tweezer, and you're going to get jumped in the plane.  Unfortunately, though, like that Reed guy, they didn't kill him.  They did hit him in the head with a fire extinguisher.  Yeah, but that's not enough.  That wasn't enough.  Come on.  That's not enough.  It's a great start.  Because it's civilized people that fly those earth. 
[02:19:00]  That's why you fly southwest, man.  You get the wretched, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Put you with the chickens.  Yeah.  You get the black guy with the gold two-faces that lost his hose.  You know what I'm saying?  You get the Mexican guy whose name is Little Puppet.  You know what I'm saying, bro?  Little Puppet.  You know, you get the redneck that's on his way to see Maury or something.  I mean, come on.  These people, man.  You know.  You die, man.  They killed that guy.  The cops come in the plane.  They're like, what happened?  I don't know.  But he's still breathing. 
[02:19:30]  I got to break in here.  Yes, very important.  Jennifer's calling in.  Jennifer?  Oh, Jennifer.  Jennifer?  Yes?  Why are you interrupting all this hilarity?  They told me that the queefing show was going to start at 6 o'clock.  The queefing show.  The queefing show.  Are you talking about the 6 o'clock queef, Jennifer?  Yes.  And where are you calling from?  Beautiful.  New Jersey.  All right.  Hold on to the line.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  At 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef. 
[02:20:00]  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  At 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tess up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  All right, Jennifer, you ready?  Yes.  All right, we're standing by.  Everyone be quiet.  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  She's getting ready. 
[02:20:30]  Come on.  Where is she?  Push it out.  What happened?  Abort.  Abort.  What happened?  Jennifer, what happened?  Nothing.  I didn't hear it.  Yeah, exactly.  We didn't hear it.  Here it goes.  All right.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's not a drop.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  At 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef. 
[02:21:00]  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  At 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tess up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  There you go.  Wow.  Yo, that sounded like a lip shaker, right?  Yeah, that was so little.  She pumped air into that.  That's why she had a turkey baster pumping air in.  You got him.  And she told her husband, punch me in the semi.  We're hanging with Carlos Mencia.  Very funny guy.  Go to carlosmencia.com, right? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Actually, go to carlosrules.com.  Carlos Rules.  Oh.  And then you can get to see these really cool cartoons.  All right.  We'll be back.  Why don't we see what's going on on the FU line.  All right.  And more with Carlos in just a bit.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie to Anthony FU line.  Hey, this is Preston.  I'm calling from Boston, and I want to send a big FU out to all those St. Louis Rams fans  who thought it wasn't going to get done.  FU.  FU. 
[02:22:00]  FU.  Next message.  This is a big FU for all those Rams fans that didn't think the Patriots could pull it off.  Well, we did.  And the red, white, and blue rocks.  So FU.  Next message.  I want to send an FU out to Terry Glenn.  And you're no good, sorry, arrogant, no Super Bowl ass.  Next message.  This is sick Mike from Boston.  I want to give a big FU to everyone who said the Patriots couldn't win the Super Bowl.  And a big FU to Chris Cotto for making fun of David Patton. 
[02:22:30]  Chris, how many touchdown passes did you catch in the postseason?  Let me thank none.  FU.  Next message.  Hey, this is Jay.  I want to give a big FU to all you Boston fans out there who are celebrating your Patriots Super Bowl.  It was a fluke.  And wait, you got two more weeks.  Baseball season's coming up and your losing ways will start again.  So FU, Boston, 1918 forever.  End of message. 
[02:23:00]  Welcome to the bottomless cage of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Fing hilarious.  And E.W.  Thank you.  Carlos Benci in the house today.  Killing for us.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We just went to carlosrules.com, right?  And you got some flash animation done to some of your bits.  Well, there's this company that it's Hyperion that they've been wanting to sell a cartoon with me forever. 
[02:23:30]  And they just couldn't get it done.  And finally, the guy got pissed and said, you know what?  Can I do something with your stand-up?  Go ahead, man.  It's cool.  Yeah, it's funny.  And then he just literally animated my stand-up.  You got the animated bit, the fat chick bit, which is hilarious.  The fat chick bit.  It's awesome.  And now it's animated for you on carlosrules.com.  And that little cartoon character, the funniest part.  It makes you look like a midget.  You're not that short. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, I know.  But the cool thing is when he puts his hands down in that bit and he starts walking toward the fat chick,  there's that look of like, I gotta do it.  It's my job.  You know what I mean?  He's like Colonel Nathan Jessup, man.  You know?  Those are fun, man.  Yeah, we're going to link that to foundrymusic.com.  Check it out later.  Actually, there's a new one.  There's six of them, but the brand new one, I've never even seen that one myself.  They just came out, so.  Yeah, check them out.  They're funny.  I was working on one of the best games ever.  I had like, I was bonus, bonus, bonus. 
[02:24:30]  I'm slamming it on T2, the pinball machine.  T2, the pinball machine, yeah.  And then I hear out of the loudspeaker.  Well.  Come on, get it to work.  It's not working today.  What's his, no batteries on that thing?  How long is this thing today?  I don't know.  Good thing I didn't have to do Mike Tyson.  There we go.  Yeah.  Are they saving the game for you, though?  No.  Big Kev already got like the ridiculous high score on it. 
[02:25:00]  227 million.  Yeah, like I got 40, 47 million the other day, and I'm like, yes, suck on that.  No one's going to beat that.  And then Big Kev got 427 million and pretty much took everybody out of the running for the high score.  I got the key to the machine.  I'll just clear the goddamn score.  But these are like newer ones.  I like the old ones when if you got like 200,000, it was like huge, you know what I mean?  A score of 2 million was like the bomb, you know?  It didn't even go up to 2 million.  It sounds good and nostalgic and everything, but we had the Rolling Stones pinball machine in there, 
[02:25:30]  and that was old school.  Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.  And it's soft.  The Playboy one was cool.  It had that dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  That was cool, man.  There's like a lot of stuff to do on those pinball machines.  Like that one's just packed with stuff.  You like the Chucky one with the mouth?  Da-da-da-da-chuck.  There's that goofy one.  You know what I mean?  I know.  I like gizmos in there that you got to like get the ball into.  Dude, you're old school, bro.  You used to play Pong when you were a kid, I'm sure, bro.  Come on now, right?  Please.  Pong was the bomb, dude.  What about the arcade on 42nd, dude? 
[02:26:00]  You never went to those?  What, the arcade?  No.  I used to play pinball on the arcade and stuff.  I used to play ColecoVision, Atari 5200.  Yeah, at home.  I used to play that, like the Commodore 64.  Oh, dude, Asteroids, remember?  Yeah.  Those are cool games, man.  Yeah, hyperspace.  Great stuff.  Dude, hyperspace.  Hyperspace.  I hated that.  Whoa, because it just threw you in a situation you couldn't get out of.  Right, hyperspace, and then all of a sudden you're in the rocks.  Hey, what's up?  What about Defender with 17 buttons you had to control? 
[02:26:30]  Defender was pretty cool, too, yeah.  Remember Joust?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's as bad as Dig Dug, bro.  Dig Dug.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That was harsh, man.  I got Dig Dug for my Game Boy Advance I can play.  Oh, you do?  Dig Dug.  Dig Dug, bro.  Yeah.  I hate Dig Dug.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, Paul.  Gallagher's my favorite old-time game.  Oh, that rules, bro.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  Hey, how are you, man? 
[02:27:00]  Hey, man.  Hey, I need to speak with Carlos, man.  I'm right here, bro.  I'm not going nowhere.  Carlos, how are you, man?  I'm doing well.  How are you, buddy?  First of all, the show is great, man.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks.  I'm glad I didn't piss you off.  There's one person that's happy.  You got the brown people listening to us today.  Thank you.  That's beautiful, man.  We need to do better with the brown people.  Yeah, so what's up, brother, man?  Well, I just want to say it.  He said it, man.  We're all friends here.  First of all, I'm from India.  Yeah?  I listen to this show every day.  Yes. 
[02:27:30]  And I love it.  Yes.  I just want to differentiate between towel heads, okay?  I never called you a towel head.  I didn't say you can.  I don't care.  Oh, okay.  It's a way of explaining it's free America, man.  Right.  The point is, towel heads in Afghanistan are different from towel heads in India.  Yeah, I agree.  I pointed that out earlier when we were talking to Posey.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Yeah, we know.  I said you guys were dirt, dirt, dirt, and they are like, so I know the difference, bro. 
[02:28:00]  Here's my impression of the energy of the O.P. and Anthony show.  All right, why don't you go and cook me up?  Was that Ms. Pac-Man or Pac-Man?  Ms. Pac-Man sucks.  Listen, by the way, I actually know how to do the ghost pattern on Pac-Man.  Oh, you do?  I actually know how to do the pattern.  How to run the pattern?  Where you actually go through one of the little ghosts.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  See, I never got so into it to where I knew the pattern, but to watch somebody, they didn't  even have to look at the screen.  Dude, they didn't have cheat books, bro. 
[02:28:30]  Yes, they did.  In 1983?  Come on, bro.  No way, dude.  They had a pattern.  They had a pattern.  Listen, let me tell you how you used to do it.  You used to get a penny and you used to do what they call flipping it.  What you do is you shove a penny right through the slot where the quarter comes out when  you push the change back and flip it up to the point where what happened in the last  year changed it, but most white people do not know how to react to gunshots.  You know what I'm saying?  I didn't know this. 
[02:29:00]  I swear to God, I'm in L.A.  We're having dinner with a buddy of mine, Ted, the white guy, Randy, the black guy, and  a drive-by occurs outside, right?  Three shots.  Boom, boom, boom.  By the time the second shot hit me and the black guy, Randy, under the table, right?  We look up and our friend, Ted, the white guy, is walking toward the shooting.  I swear to God.  And we're like, what are you doing?  And he's like, maybe I can see who did it.  We're like, jackass.  If you can see them, they can see you.  Get your ass down.  What a retard. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  And then it was just like to him, it was totally foreign.  It was like, what do you want?  You know, I don't get it.  I'm not used to that kind of thing.  Why are you ducking?  You know, I'm like, nobody's hunting, dumbass.  They're not looking for deer.  They're looking for humans, man.  Get your ass down.  Because there's certain things that are just like neighborhood, you know.  Yeah.  You learn.  When you have money.  Did you grow up middle class?  Lower middle, I guess.  So you had quarters.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So we didn't have quarters.  You know what I'm saying?  Because people improvise. 
[02:30:00]  No matter what it takes, people will improvise.  It's human nature.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like hate, for example.  Hate is just the basic primary thing that we have because we're insecure about each other.  This has nothing to do whatsoever with race.  In America, we make it about race because that's obvious.  But in Africa, black people kill black people all the time.  Yeah.  And they look exactly alike.  You know what I'm saying?  But they find other reasons.  You know what I mean?  Have them up with Michelle.  Right?  Look at the Irish.  You know what I mean?  No black people in Ireland.  They find a reason. 
[02:30:30]  Where do you go to church?  Over here?  Well, I'll go over there.  I'll blow your ass up.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like.  Well, have a brave heart coming after you.  You're there, kid.  Absolutely.  Have a brave heart.  We improvise, my friends.  Brave heart coming after you.  Brave heart.  That's Scottish, dude.  Come on, dude.  I'm talking about Irish.  Violet, too, man.  That's part two.  He's mixing.  He's mixing.  All right, Adam.  That's cool.  Adam has a question for Carlos Mancia. 
[02:31:00]  Uh-oh.  Adam.  Hi, how are you guys doing?  All right, man.  What's up, Adam?  I wonder why you and Chong broke up.  Ah!  Hey, man.  I broke up with you, man.  Hey, you want to hear something funny?  You want to hear something funny?  Yeah.  About a week ago, I got a phone call from somebody asking if I was willing to do a movie with  them.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was like, come on, dude.  I don't want to be your Chong, bro.  Come on. 
[02:31:30]  Samantha wants you to do a bit here.  This is a great bit.  Samantha.  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah, I saw his special the other night on HBO.  It was hysterical.  Hell, yeah.  Oh, by the way, say that louder.  What?  I'll tell you why.  You saw my special and you loved it because I recorded it seven years ago and a lot of  that stuff is topical.  And part of the problem that I'm having right now is that all my stuff is topical and Comedy  Central doesn't want it to be topical because they're afraid that if you play it in five  or ten years, people are going to be like, well, that's dated. 
[02:32:00]  Well, then they just get you back to do a new one.  Yeah, but that, but exactly.  But my point being is that is like that one was dated.  That's the one where I did stuff about the riots, right?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Can't quite put it like that.  Hold on.  Where they ingest the whole body.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah, well, we got to clean it up because they're dumping out of that.  But yeah, the serial killer bit where they, you want to do a little bit of that or I  don't know.  Yeah, whatever, man.  I'm just talking.  I'm just talking. 
[02:32:30]  Why don't we let Carlos explain?  Okay, thanks.  Bye.  He'll do a better job.  All right.  He'll make it radio friendly, right, Carlos?  Well, remember how earlier I was talking about everybody's got to claim their stuff at the  airport.  You know, if somebody's trying to sneak in Kool-Aid, we got to put the black people aside.  If too many people are trying to fit in one plane, we got to put the spics on the side.  Everybody should claim what they do.  So, my point was, is that white people in America, and this still works today.  You guys are the people that shoot up schools. 
[02:33:00]  You guys are the people that snap when you get fired.  And the reason is, is because you don't allow yourself freedom of speech.  There's a reason why blacks and Hispanics don't snap at schools, because we do your mama  jokes before it ever gets to that level.  You know, if somebody says something about you, you don't walk away, go home and go,  I'm going to go to the internet and find out how to put a pipe bomb in his ass.  You know what I mean?  When somebody says, you're weird.  You're like, yeah, well, your mother's so black, she got pulled over on a bike for tin  and windows.  Everybody laughs, and it's a beautiful story. 
[02:33:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I thought I heard all mama's notes.  That's all I got to remember.  You know what I'm saying?  So, anyway, my whole point was that I claimed my stuff.  I said, all right, blacks and Mexicans, I'm not going to be sanctimonious.  And at the time, I used to pick on white people a lot.  And I just was like, look, blacks and Mexicans, we'll stab you, we'll shoot you, we'll mug  you, we'll rape you, we'll kill you, but we'll never eat you.  That is the one thing that we will never, ever do.  Never eat you.  You never heard of Julio, eight people, never heard that one. 
[02:34:00]  And the weird thing about Dahmer was that they found arms, limbs, legs, buttocks, pecs.  Don't say the P word.  Right.  That's what they'll dump out of it.  But, but no, no junk, no junk, no man junk, no man junk, no man junk.  And I'm thinking to myself, all right, see, that's where I draw the line.  The eating part doesn't bother me.  Yeah.  Eating people part.  I can feel that.  You know, I saw a movie called The Live when I was a kid.  Right. 
[02:34:30]  Where the plane landed and they ate the people.  And if I was, I'm not going to sit here and say, I would never, I will eat your ass.  If we're, if we're in a plane crash and I ran out of Snickers, guess what?  You're getting eaten.  But if they find me dead, they will find me lying next to a pile of bones and man junk.  That's what you're going to find.  Because I, I refuse to go that far.  And not that I don't think I contemplated, but with my luck, you know what I mean?  I'd be thinking, no, I shouldn't, maybe.  And as soon as I put it up and put it in my mouth, the helicopter, here we are. 
[02:35:00]  No!  You know what I'm saying?  Oh my God, he's eating the man junk.  I swear to God, I was, I'm starving and it's been two weeks and I hadn't eaten anything.  Put it down.  Put the man junk down.  It's not a Snickers, Carlos.  Put it down.  Oh, that's horrible.  Oh, dude, that's the truth, man.  Pat has a problem with you now.  Pat, what's up?  Oh, Jesus, Pat. 
[02:35:30]  My God.  What's up, Carlos?  What's up, boys?  What's the problem, Pat?  There is black people in Ireland.  Oh, the black Irish, you mean?  Yeah, there's a couple.  I don't think one or two.  I don't know.  Well, someone's got to sell the drugs.  Yeah, we've got to get up in some way.  And plus, we just got Chinese restaurants, too.  So, you know, we're moving up.  Oh, I never said anything about Ireland.  It's not all about bars.  Wait, Pat, you're from Ireland?  No, no, no.  Yeah.  And you see, all right.  No, all I was saying was that in the world, when we have insecurities, it's not about race. 
[02:36:00]  We will improvise.  And that was my whole point about that, is that in Ireland, everybody's white, and you  guys still find a way to kill each other.  Hey, somebody has to make the Nikes.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  All right, Pat.  Moving on.  Take care, Pat.  You have a great day.  Yeah, good for you.  We didn't get to the Michael Jordan story today.  Uh-oh.  Damn it.  Oh, he's getting back with his wife.  Yeah.  He did the math. 
[02:36:30]  Cheaper to keep her.  What up?  Cheaper to keep her, Mike.  Cheaper to keep her.  Well, she was the one that filed divorce papers.  Yeah, but...  Yeah.  They got to her.  They did the math together and said, look.  Here's the deal.  No, she's got a prenup, bro.  Trust me.  She's got a prenup.  What do you mean?  She's got a prenuptial agreement with him.  She tried to nail him to the cross with this divorce.  She wanted everything.  Half of everything.  I never saw her lace up and go hit the boards.  And she wanted both houses. 
[02:37:00]  It's not even a house.  Using the word house is ridiculous.  We saw a big...  A state.  Sprawling.  A state.  25,000 square feet?  It's ridiculous.  And then there's basketball courts and tennis courts.  And something happened.  Yeah, we're...  All right.  Let's get back together.  I think she broke up with him because he went back to playing and he's not the...  You know, he's right now not the greatest player ever.  I think he's bagging everything that moves.  I think Michael Jordan is not the most monogamous guy. 
[02:37:30]  Basketball players are not known for their...  Monogamy.  Right.  Exactly.  So...  Or as basketball players would say, monotony.  The monotony.  Oh, come on.  I'm monotonous.  I love you, baby.  I don't cheat on my woman.  I'm monotonous.  I'm monotonous.  I love you forever.  Stop.  That is so sad.  I went so long without picking on the black people and there it is.  Monotonous.  Monotonous, man. 
[02:38:00]  I'm monotonous in L.A. and Chicago.  And they don't know that they're really being like...  They're being accurate.  You are monotonous.  You screw a chick everywhere you go.  You are completely monotonous.  Hi, Mike.  Good decision.  Hi, this is O.J.  Hey, perhaps I could help you out.  Oh, you want to hear a weird O.J. story?  That he needs.  We love O.J. stories on this show.  Do you really?  Oh, my...  We can't get enough of them.  O.J. is my favorite celebrity.  I'm totally serious.  Oh, okay.  Beautiful.  Your wife thought I was kidding. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  I'm serious.  We love the O.J.  We get so excited when O.J. is in the news.  We can't wait to get on the air.  Dude, this is unbelievable, man.  I'm performing in Miami, and I guess he lives in Miami.  Yeah.  So somebody comes up to me with this really weird look on their face, you know?  And I'm just like, what's up?  They don't even say hi to me.  They just hand me, you know, a little piece of paper on it.  You know, so I'm like, oh, what the hell is going on here?  So I look on the paper, and it says, O.J. called.  Call back.  I'm like, what?  O.J.  O.J. called.  I need an alibi. 
[02:39:00]  I'm just like, O.J. called.  What the...  You know?  So I call the number, and it's some O.J.'s assistant, and the guy's like, yeah, man,  O.J. wants to come to your show, and he just wants to know if it's okay if he comes.  I'm like, dude, it's a free country, man.  You want free tickets?  I'll hook you up.  He's like, no, no, no.  He wants to pay.  He just wants to know if it's okay if he can come.  I said, he can come, but what's your real question, man?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  What are you trying to ask?  He's like, you know, Carlos, he wants to know if it's okay to come to see a comedy show. 
[02:39:30]  And I'm like, oh, he wants to know if I'm going to call him a murder and stabbing son of a bitch on the stage.  Hey, look who's in the audience.  Yeah.  I said, no, man, he was acquitted.  As far as I'm concerned, he's not guilty.  It's cool.  Bring him down, man.  Keep your girlfriend away from him, man.  Yeah, look at your girlfriend.  Yeah, exactly.  He would like your girlfriend.  I never thought about that, man.  That's why he...  Yeah, exactly.  You're going out with the tall blonde.  Yo, man, your woman looks like Nicole.  Let me tell you what you do, Carlos. 
[02:40:00]  Never let him drive the Ferrari.  Carlos was bringing her sunglasses, man.  We have to play the prank calls now from Kid Chris in Sacramento.  Oh, I love these.  It's really quick.  This guy, Kid Chris, he's on after us in Sacramento.  He got OJ's cell phone.  OJ's cell phone.  Oh, he did?  And we just hound him every day.  It's a little montage you put together.  Listen to this.  It's beautiful.  Yeah.  Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  What is this?  This is AC. 
[02:40:30]  Let's go kill somebody tonight.  Bye.  Juice?  Yeah.  Hello.  OJ.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if you could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ?  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say you and I are going to kill the Spice Girls? 
[02:41:00]  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing.  What do you say?  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people, and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer, OJ.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Juice, what's up?  Who is it? 
[02:41:30]  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around?  You know, have some beers?  Maybe kill somebody?  Yeah.  Hi, OJ.  It's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them.  We can hold them underwater or something.  How'd it go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, OJ. 
[02:42:00]  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  Gone.  That's it.  That's great.  Hey, you know, based on the way he's reacting, I don't think he killed her.  Holy, dude.  Listen, he is either the coldest bloody murderer in the history of the planet, or he really didn't do it.  Right.  Because that laugh, it's just too, like, it's too non-evil. 
[02:42:30]  There's a third option there, though, that he completely lost his mind, suffered some type of breakdown, where he honestly believes he did not kill.  Yeah, he convinced himself.  But you know something, Carlos?  I don't think he did.  Come on.  Come on.  Here, let me tell you why.  Why?  Let me tell you why.  All right.  We have one minute left in the show.  All right, here's really quick.  This is, like, crime scene investigator stuff.  Okay.  If he stabbed those people as much as he did, he would have had to take a shower, you know what I mean, in his home to clean himself up. 
[02:43:00]  And what they do is they check your drain for residue of any kind of blood that they didn't find anywhere in his house.  So it's kind of like it just, some of that stuff doesn't make sense, man.  They found a hole somewhere.  They found blood.  They found clothes.  No, they found a drop of blood.  A drop of blood.  They found a trail of blood up the friggin' sidewalk where he, I cut my finger, chipping golf ball.  The goddamn limo guy that was supposed to take him to the airport waiting outside.  O.J., O.J., O.J. 
[02:43:30]  He was in the shower.  For an hour, exactly.  He was in the shower, man.  And then the masked guy came around the corner, ran into the house, and then, O.J., yes?  O.J., I just saw you running in the house.  No, no, not me.  I was inside.  No, O.J., I just saw you.  You ran from the side of the house into the front door.  Nope, nope.  He was acquitted, bro, because he didn't do it.  Just when I thought Whitey and the Beaner would get along, he was acquitted because  he didn't do it.  No, he was acquitted.  I don't agree on the O.J. thing.  What a surprise.  Johnny Cochran convinced a biased jury that the LAPD is... 
[02:44:00]  I'm just kidding, man.  No, no, no.  No, we've got to go.  They're going to kill us.  We went really late today.  Oh, no, that's cool.  Next time, Carlos, we love you.  Bro, I love you, too.  I'll be back.  All right, and he's not playing anywhere, unfortunately, but you go to carlosrules.com,  and I think carlosmancee.com.  Both of them, it doesn't matter.  All right, and he's linked to our website.  Carlos, it's always a pleasure.  Love you guys, man.
