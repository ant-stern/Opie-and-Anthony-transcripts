<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a disturbing discussion surrounding a New York Post photograph depicting a man about to be hit by a subway train.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton debated the bystanders' inaction, the photographer's ethics, and the possible culpability of the victim, who, according to a played audio clip of a pre-incident argument, may have provoked a homeless assailant. The conversation expanded into a broader discussion on bystander intervention, featuring caller anecdotes illustrating the complexities of choosing to intervene or remain uninvolved. This segued into a discussion of the HBO documentary series "Witness," focusing on the risks faced by war correspondents.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the "bystander effect," using the Kitty Genovese murder as an example.  They then introduced their upcoming guest, Martin Freeman, expressing disappointment with the show’s overly detailed prep sheet about *The Hobbit*.  They also mentioned upcoming guests Larry King and Andrew Dice Clay.  A significant portion focused on audience reactions to *The Hobbit*, including reports of nausea and dizziness caused by its high frame rate.  This led to a heated debate on the merits of the high frame rate technology. The conversation then veered into highly offensive, crude jokes about the British Royal Family, including the Queen, Prince William, and Prince Harry, and speculations about a future "dud" royal baby.  Several callers contributed information, leading to further offensive jokes.  A discussion on gout, fueled by caller experiences, momentarily diverted the conversation before returning to criticisms of the show’s prep sheet, involving a dispute with producer Sal.  The segment concluded with Jim Norton discussing his body image issues, workout routine, and a humorous anecdote about a creepy gym encounter.

The next segment focused on the hosts' penchant for shocking each other and guests for comedic effect.  They recounted several instances, including a five-minute long, approximately 2009-2010 clip of a caller’s tragic phone call about his daughter’s death, met with Anthony's jarring soundboard effects, which initially shocked but later led to laughter. They discussed Jim Norton’s cake-stomping prank on a homeless man, a prank involving Steve the Whistler that made Anthony hide, and Patrice O'Neal’s hilarious reaction to a Bobo video. Tom Papa was announced as an upcoming guest, and Opie mentioned sending him the clip of the tragic phone call.  The discussion included Jim Norton’s stand-up career, contrasting comedy styles (Norton's provocative versus Papa’s wider appeal), a humorous DMX rendition of "Rudolph," and extensive,  frustrated discussion about stepping in dog shit in New York City, expanding into broader pet ownership issues.  The segment concluded with further discussion about upcoming appearances and anticipation for playing the soundboard clip.

A subsequent segment began with discussion about a celebrity (implied to be Wiz Khalifa) smelling strongly of marijuana. This transitioned into a conversation about fatherhood, including one host's "poignant father moment" involving dog feces and a Christmas tree, challenges of raising children, and the merits of working versus staying at home. This included a video showing a "snowing Christmas tree."  Several live reads, most notably a lengthy, mocked advertisement for Hinder’s album, were interspersed with caller interactions. Jimmy briefly left to get a picture with Wiz Khalifa, leading to a discussion about celebrity encounters.

A substantial portion featured a studio visit from Martin Freeman.  He discussed *The Hobbit*, its filming process (heavy use of green screen), the high frame rate version, his experience on the UK version of *The Office*, and his career. Jim Norton announced a new advice show.  The segment concluded with further discussion about *The Hobbit*'s 3D effects.

A final segment included an interview with Martin Freeman focusing on *The Hobbit*'s production, its transformation into a trilogy, the inclusion of comedic elements, and the book's lighter tone compared to *Lord of the Rings*.  Freeman discussed his unfamiliarity with the *Lord of the Rings* universe and his enjoyment of the film. The hosts expressed a desire for a longer interview in the future, and the interview concluded with promotional information.  The broadcast ended with suggestive banter between the hosts about the length of future interviews.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning!  Excuse me.  Stupid voices all dry from chanting last night.  What were you chanting?  I went to meditation.  Oh.  You fucking meditate, you chant for a while, and my voice gets nice and dry. 
[00:00:30]  What the fuck?  I thought you were at home watching sports.  Why would I be watching sports yesterday?  Chanting.  Oh.  Ba-na-ba-ba-na-ba.  I didn't know you were meditating.  Giants lost to the Redskins last night.  I couldn't be happier.  Not a Giants fan.  Yeah, and I like Robert Griffin.  Is it Griffin or Griffith?  RG3.  It's RG3.  I like him.  RG3 is a damn good quarterback.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  The Jets need a guy like RG3.  What was the final score last night?  17-16, right?  Yeah.  It was a really good game.  Good morning.  It's Opie and Jim Norton today.  With Sam possibly piping in.  Oh.  That's the audience, Sam.  Sorry.  I had to do their part.  It's okay.  Oh.  They need a voice, too.  Oh.  I got to start by saying I'm completely horrified by the front page of the New York Post here 
[00:01:30]  in New York City.  That's exactly the story I'm looking at.  I'm completely horrified by the picture.  This, I guess it's a New York Post photographer just happened to be on the subway tracks.  Yeah.  I just tweeted the picture, if you want to see it, on my Twitter there, Opie Radio.  I rarely tweet front pages of papers, but this one is just fucking horrifying.  It's also amazing to me.  The photographer said that he was taking these pictures to get the flash to warn the... 
[00:02:00]  Nah.  He saw this as an opportunity for a great picture.  How about somebody tries to pull this guy...  And I understand it's scary to get near the train like that.  Right.  Because you don't want to get pulled onto the tracks.  Yeah.  But how about a few people run over and pull this guy up off the tracks?  Well, if you see the other pictures, it looks like they had time to pull him up.  And it looks like the photographer was the closest to this person.  So all he had to do was reach over and go, give me your fucking hand.  I'm going to pull you to safety.  Yeah.  This guy was a little bit dazed.  Anyway, the cover, it says, pushed on the subway track. 
[00:02:30]  This man is about to die.  And then in big letters, doomed.  And the photograph basically is a guy on the subway tracks.  He's trying to get up over the edge.  He's got his left elbow on the edge.  And he's turned toward the subway train that is barreling down on him.  It's the Q train.  You see the fucking, I just call them headlights.  I don't know.  I guess they're just called headlights of the subway. 
[00:03:00]  And then you see the driver with his eyes just illuminated like he's a bat.  That's terrible.  This is literally less than a second from when the subway train hit him.  And also the animal.  And killed him.  And killed him.  Yeah.  The animal who threw him in was probably still in the vicinity.  He was some.  They don't have him.  No, but they have pictures of him.  Yeah, they'll get him.  This fucking animal.  He's probably homeless.  But I think that guy was still in the area.  Because you can see in one of the pictures, you can see the guy vaguely on the tracks. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  And then you can see this fucking animal standing up on the platform.  And then beyond this guy is people.  Right.  So it's almost like to go too close to this guy to help him up was the guy who threw him on the tracks, who was a crazy guy, was right there.  So I guess I understand why people would have run over.  Yeah.  Queen's dad pushed to his death by madman in Times Square Station.  That's fucking horrible.  I have some questions for the photographer, because he seems to be the one that's closest to this man as he's trying to get back up on the platform. 
[00:04:00]  Just a horrifying picture.  Horrifying.  Yep.  And I hate to say it, because I know Ant would say it if he was here, but if someone could have shot that guy, and I'm not, again, a second, an NRA guy, but if somebody could have shot this animal.  Right.  Somebody would have been able to pull this guy up off the tracks.  Yeah.  Instead of everybody just standing.  And I understand why people stand there, because you're not, it's not like it's ten friends out together.  You're all strangers.  Right.  You can't just become a group and a force of one sometimes.  It's hard to do.  Man, I mean, a whole group of people. 
[00:04:30]  That is the weird thing.  And they're all just trying to warn the conductor, and I mean, you need a lot of room to stop those subway trains.  And meanwhile, nobody wanted to just run and tackle this fucking savage and pull this guy up off the tracks.  You know, I would like to think I would be the guy that runs and tackles this guy.  I don't know, man.  No, I wouldn't either.  I don't know.  But if there's ten of you.  It's easy to say, oh, I would have tackled him, because most people would say that.  But now I'm trying to really think deep about this, and I don't know, man.  I've got two kids now, which changes your mindset a little bit, too. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know if you'd really be able to organize and all attack it.  Like, you're talking about five seconds.  No, but it's the instinct that people, it's the point that, and I'm not saying I would do it.  Yeah, I'm not questioning these people in the background, because they're all leaning over trying to get the attention of the driver of the subway train.  But I question the photographer, man.  He seems really close, and it seems like that's just one arm, and you could get this guy up over the edge.  Yeah, but look where this fucking animal is standing. 
[00:05:30]  Like, look where the arrow is.  If we're looking in the post here, and you could see the guy on the tracks, it's a little teeny blurb in this one shot.  Right.  But right up to the left of him on the platform is the guy.  So you would have to go between the attacker and the train tracks to pull this guy.  And I understand why you wouldn't want to risk being pushed in front of a train.  Yeah.  But this guy should have learned from that one guy and just laid flat.  You know, I guess he was two days to get up himself.  Go ahead.  But they're saying he might have been drunk, too. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  There's one witness says...  Which, the animal was drunk?  No, the guy.  The guy who died.  What?  There's one witness, at least one, that says he was the aggressor, and he was starting shit with this homeless guy.  And the cops found a bottle of vodka on the dead guy.  There's audio we have.  We got audio of the story?  Well, it's not the story.  It's the actual argument.  Because like what Travis was saying, apparently the homeless guy was, like, yelling at people.  Right.  It's just being a, you know, I'm...  A vagrant. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, a vagrant.  And this...  How do you get audio?  This guy went up to him and started saying, you know, leave these people alone.  And then the guy who got pushed on the track...  But who was recording this?  Some passerby on the subway that was waiting for the train took out their phone and started recording, like, 10 seconds of the two of them arguing.  Leave me the f*** alone.  Take your motherf***ing ass over there.  Stand in line.  Wait for the R train.  That's it.  That's the guy that ended up dead?  No. 
[00:07:00]  It's the homeless guy.  The guy saying, leave me alone is the homeless guy.  Saying, take your ass over there.  Get out of my face.  Leave me alone.  He doesn't sound like a typical homeless guy.  Hold on.  Let me hear that again.  Or, I mean...  Leave me the f*** alone.  Take your motherf***ing ass over there.  Stand in line.  Wait for the R train.  That's it.  Yeah, that was the guy who pushed him.  You sure?  Yeah.  So maybe this guy was one of these homeless guys just yelling at people, which they do.  Most times they don't touch you.  I mean, and maybe this guy was drunk and went up and goes, what?  And started. 
[00:07:30]  Well, this guy apparently had just gotten into a fight with his wife.  Who?  The guy who got pushed on the tracks.  God.  Because he drinks too much.  Right.  And then he went out and he was drinking.  And then, you know...  Started messing with the homeless guy for whatever reason.  The homeless guy turns around and pushes him on the tracks.  I think it sounds like he kind of wanted to be a hero.  Ah, fuck them all then.  And be like, stop fucking with these people.  The guy's still an animal for pushing him on the tracks.  Of course he is.  Of course.  You don't pick someone up and throw him on the tracks.  Of course.  Wow.  And then...  But the guy pushed him on the tracks. 
[00:08:00]  Like, he didn't just, like, shove him and say, get away from me.  Like, he waited until the announcement.  The train is coming.  You know what?  And he picked him up and launched him.  So he wanted him to get hit by the train.  You know what?  I feel a little better now.  I thought...  Because he...  I just thought it was just a completely innocent guy with a family, just minding his own business.  And then this animal comes from behind and just pushes him on the track.  Now that I know there was a little confrontation at all, obviously the guy shouldn't have died  and all that, but I just feel just slightly better about the situation.  Because he did make a mistake.  Like, you could say, well, I wouldn't make that mistake, so I wouldn't get put. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, because it horrifies me.  Living in New York City, it horrifies me.  People do die for doing absolutely nothing.  You're walking down the street, a homeless guy takes a brick and slam...  You know, hits you over the head with it and all that crap.  I mean, it's still a tragic situation here, but I don't feel as bad now.  Is that all right?  It's because, as Sam said, it's a...  When you see this cover, it's helpless.  Right.  Because, like, to be thrown on the track so helplessly, it's unavoidable.  It's why the media or why people try to figure out why guys like James Holmes shoot up theaters. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  Because we want to not feel so helpless.  But with this, when you realize he argued, you're like, oh, I wouldn't have been helpless  because I wouldn't have done that.  Like, I could have avoided that.  Whereas if he had just thrown him on the tracks for no reason, it's a hopeless feeling.  Yeah, I mean, if there's a confrontation, you know, it doesn't mean you should be thrown  on the subway tracks and killed, of course.  No, of course.  But as a human being, you feel a little better about it because you're like, this guy could  have absolutely avoided this.  Yeah.  Every time I'm on the subway tracks, I always make sure there's a wall at my back. 
[00:09:30]  Always.  You know, far away, say, from the yellow line?  Huh?  Like, how far away do you have to stay from that yellow line?  I walk away from people to begin with because I don't trust anyone in that situation.  Subways are just a strange place to begin with.  And then I'll lean to see if the train's coming and all that, and I'll be, you know, at the  yellow line.  And then I'll go, what am I doing?  And then I am back all the way up, and I lean up against the wall until the train comes  every single fucking time.  Every time.  Because no matter, you know, where you are, there's always a couple fucking strange people 
[00:10:00]  down there that you just aren't sure of.  The worst are the tracks, or the platforms where there's tracks on both sides.  Because then there's no wall.  I always try to just stand as directly in the middle as humanly possible.  You're just running around until the train comes.  Yeah.  I hug the girders.  Yeah.  Whatever they're called.  I just hug that.  I just hold the tops of the benches really tight.  That's why I think in Japan, all of the subway tracks are glassed off, and the glass doors  only open when the subway is right there. 
[00:10:30]  Like at the airport?  Yeah.  Well, that would be smart, but that would never happen in New York City.  They can't even figure out how to keep this profitable.  Now are they going to make glass walls?  Of course not.  It just doesn't happen often enough for that to happen.  There's so much corruption in New York City.  It's a once a year thing.  There's so much corruption in New York City.  You think we're going to get glass walls ever?  Of course not.  We can't even be told when the train is coming.  It's still just shitty fucking subway trains.  They show you a brand new one every once in a while. 
[00:11:00]  Like, see?  Look at this.  There are some subway trains that are 60 years old and aren't going to be replaced for another  10 or 15 years.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But you go to some of these other cities and everything's brand fucking new.  Very rarely do you hear, like, Patrice had a funny bit on the woman who was leaning in  and got pushed off by the maniac.  Once in a while, a maniac will push someone on the tracks or something like this happens,  but very rarely do you hear guy who was attempting to hug the wall dreaded off and thrown. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Very rarely do you have a full man fighting.  When you're fighting for your...  I imagine if you're getting thrown on the tracks, you're fighting for your life.  Right.  Um, I don't think that happens very often.  Yeah, you have to make sure you're on a platform.  You're the least convenient guy to be thrown onto the track.  Yeah, of course.  You widen your stance.  You do everything possible.  It's scary, though, man.  It's scary down there.  It really is.  And then you get on the subway train, you look around, like, all right, who's the maniac  on this particular train?  Do you know how many times I have to change cars in the morning? 
[00:12:00]  You do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Well, I go through some really not good sections of Brooklyn, and, you know, crazy people get  on all the time and just start yelling, and you just gotta move.  Wait, they're yelling at you, or just...  No, just yelling in general, you know, about whatever's going on in their life.  I, I, I'm not scared of those type of people whatsoever.  The ones that yell and scream are, are, they're harmless.  It's the ones that are quiet that you gotta worry about always.  I'm just more concerned about getting a little nap before I get in there. 
[00:12:30]  Sometimes the yell are, it depends on what they're yelling.  Like, I'll watch, like, I was in a cab the other day, and I was watching this homeless  guy yell at people.  Not necessarily at people just yelling, but everyone that was walking by and around him,  he wasn't touching people.  Like, you can always, they always have that little moment where they show you that they're  not as crazy.  Yeah.  They're just kind of being, this was the guy by the old XM building who would always  yell, and just, they're just being dicks.  Right.  And they're nuts, but they're usually not gonna grab somebody.  Wait, which guy over at XM?  I just saw him recently. 
[00:13:00]  I don't, I don't know how long he was.  I saw him from across the street.  We had a yelling guy?  Yeah, but he might not have been there all along.  I might just see him more because I go home that way sometimes.  Oh, okay.  If I'm walking by the Brooklyn Diner.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, there you go.  The front page of the paper.  Bravo to the New York Post, but I want to talk to the photographer.  But I get why he didn't help him, though.  I get, when I saw where the guy was, I understand why the photographer wouldn't risk his life.  Well, he claims in that article that he was just flashing away trying to get the...  That is complete bullshit.  That's a lie. 
[00:13:30]  No, that's a lie.  I think he was trying to get the front page.  That's a lie.  And that makes me, you know, question what the fuck was his motive because he knew he  had to come up with a reason why he was snapping photographs in that situation instead of helping.  The framing of this picture.  The framing is perfect.  It's not like it's a picture.  You don't think he was just willy-nilly clicking away?  No, it's perfect for the front page of the paper.  He's thinking Pulitzer Prize right here.  Yeah.  That's what he's thinking.  It's perfect.  If you know anything about photography, this is a perfect shot. 
[00:14:00]  It's thirds.  Would you Instagram that?  You always got to go thirds.  He's got the thirds.  Yeah.  He's got the guy and then the blank space and then the train.  Although the guy who makes the front page fucked up his thirds.  How's that?  Well, on the website, you've got the thirds.  You've got the people in the background on the left side all going, waving, going, what  the fuck, help?  And then you've got the train right in the middle, dead center.  And then on the final third of the photograph, you've got the guy.  It's a perfect photograph.  It really is.  But there is no...  What I mean by pack mentality is that that group... 
[00:14:30]  There's a movie called The Incident with Martin Sheen.  It's his first movie, I think, with Jeff Boatbridges in it.  And I talked to him about it when he called, where Martin Sheen and Tony Massante play  these, like, you know, in 67, they play these thugs who come out of the train.  They're terrorizing the train car.  And there's a black couple.  There's Ed McMahon is in it, him and his wife with their little baby.  There's all these different couples.  And these two thugs are kind of terrorizing them individually.  And nobody is standing up to them. 
[00:15:00]  And it's a statement about the fact that we will all just watch each other get harassed  instead of as a group.  And, you know, of course, finally, fucking Boatbridges, who has a broken arm, stands  up and fucking smashes him with his cast.  Because you're just going to add a lot of shit to your day.  That's what goes through everyone's mind.  It's going to be more complicated.  Every time, like, an old lady falls, you know, on the streets, I'm there to help.  But I'll wait a couple seconds hoping that someone is faster than me.  And I'm like, oh, thank God. 
[00:15:30]  And then they have to get them together and walk them to where they need to be and all  that.  And I'm thinking, wow, man, that would be that would be a lot of work.  Yeah.  And I would miss work or something.  Yeah.  And I think don't we all think that way?  Well, that guy, Joe, remember the guy, Joe, got stabbed in a train?  Right.  Defending those people.  Like, you know, I don't think I would be that guy.  I'm not a hero.  I'm not.  He was a tougher guy than I am.  But I think most human instinct is survival.  And you're just thinking about how do I stay safe?  Yeah, I agree.  I'll be fine.  And there's just like a few people like that guy who will stand up and be a hero. 
[00:16:00]  Most human instinct is you got a track.  You leave your house and you got a particular track you follow, meaning your routine.  And you don't want that interrupted whatsoever.  Right.  And you get really bummed and pissed off if somebody gets in your way and interrupts that.  Because you're seeing that old lady fall and you go, this is not 30 seconds of me going  and picking her up.  This is 10 minutes.  Exactly.  And I don't have the 10 minutes at the moment.  Exactly.  And if they're bleeding or something, now you know you got to stay with them until, like,  help arrives. 
[00:16:30]  Or you might have to go to the hospital with them.  Or if you're a witness to something.  Right.  No one feels good helping.  But I mean not the helping.  I mean the, I mean this, not that.  I mean an instinct.  Like, you've seen what a mob can do.  Like, the mob mentality does exist.  Like, when you see a picture of people rioting.  Well, 9-11.  They got together on the plane.  Oh, right.  Exactly.  Yes.  But that doesn't happen often.  No.  You got to feel complete desperation and then something happens with the people around you 
[00:17:00]  and then you get that mob mentality like, holy fuck, okay, we can possibly do something  here.  But you have to know you're saving yourself as well as everyone else.  Yes.  Yeah, all those people on that plane knew we're definitely dying.  Yeah.  Like, they're going to crash this plane.  Now we have to do something because that's the only thing.  But look at a riot.  Look at a riot or anything outside where just a group of people, you know, the Middle East is  a good example.  You know, they're all screaming.  I mean, when you get that many people together to do something, you can get a group of people  together quickly.  It's like, how do you get everybody to lock on the same thing immediately, which is fucking 
[00:17:30]  pulling this guy up?  Or just if 10 or 12 people are running at that guy, men and women.  Right.  That guy's in trouble.  I have an example.  And this certainly isn't going to make me look good.  Fuck it.  It's great for the radio.  I was up early one morning, right?  And I'm walking to Starbucks.  Six, six, six, six in the morning.  This is a while ago.  Hopefully they can't question me.  I see a guy at a red light, completely asleep in a work van, completely asleep. 
[00:18:00]  And the car starts moving forward.  There's no traffic.  And he's absolutely asleep.  I can't wake him up.  I'm watching this go down now.  I'm like, holy fuck, the car's now moving.  The guy's completely out, whether he was drinking all night, partying, or just tired from his  job.  And I see him just completely, do I really want to say that again, roll into a parked  car.  Just rolls into it.  Now I'm thinking to myself, fuck, I just want to get coffee. 
[00:18:30]  What do I do?  Do I write down the license plate?  Do I call the cops?  Well, what did he do after he rolled into the park car?  I watched him, and he woke up and like, holy fuck, I mean, I just crashed into this car.  Did significant damage to the back bumper of this car.  The one thing I was thinking the whole time was, why wasn't I recording this?  I couldn't get my phone out in time.  And the guy got himself together, backed up, and pulled away.  I had time to write his license plate down, write the license plate down of the car he 
[00:19:00]  hit.  I did none of that.  You didn't write the guys?  Because I didn't want to get involved.  I didn't want, because I started fast forwarding.  Look, I'm saying this makes me look like a piece of shit.  Yeah.  All right, I'm sharing.  But I was thinking ahead, going, this is like, this is going to be like two hours in  my fucking morning.  I don't want to deal with this.  All you had to do was write down the guy's license plate and say, this is the plate of  the car that hit you.  No, man.  And just put it on the windshield wipers.  Maybe.  That's a good idea.  And then just walk away.  That's exactly what I would do.  Who has paper and a pen with them, though? 
[00:19:30]  That happened to me once.  I didn't have paper and a pen.  Right on the back of a receipt at Starbucks.  And I wasn't thinking bare minimum.  I'm thinking, all right, I got to call like 9-1-1 or something.  Now I got to wait for somebody to come.  And they got to write up the whole report.  Do you know how long you would have waited if you called 9-1-1 and said, a guy hit a parked  car and kept going and there's a little damage?  They would have laughed at you.  That's what I was thinking, too.  Yeah.  And then I couldn't memorize the license plates.  You got a little... 
[00:20:00]  I have a phone.  Phone.  You texted it to yourself.  Well, I probably should have taken pictures of the license plates really fast.  But then I felt bad for the guy.  Who fell asleep?  Yeah, because I'm thinking it was more of a situation that he was a guy working really  hard to the point where he was exhausted and fell asleep on the way home.  He still should have done the right thing, though.  He didn't look like he was a partier.  But you know how fucking pissed I would be if I parked my car and there was a van dent  in the side of it from some asshole who fell asleep?  It was more like the back right bumper.  But it was significant.  He hit him at a pretty good clip.  A pretty good roll. 
[00:20:30]  Because some dick fell asleep and now I'm stuck for that.  My car's just parked.  And there's a dent in it.  Look, I told you it wasn't going to look good.  Well, a lot of guys don't want to get involved.  But it brings up the point that you figure it out in your head.  Do I really want to waste two hours because this idiot just fucking fell asleep and hit  a parked car?  You know, Opie, not only would I waste the two hours, but I would pursue the vehicle.  You would.  I would pursue the vehicle and try to get an officer involved.  We do have proof of Jimmy.  Although.  That shows you what getting involved does. 
[00:21:00]  It's a waste of time.  Look, I'm a piece of shit because I probably should have done something.  But I'm sitting there going, you know, I just, Saturday morning I go to Starbucks, I read  a couple of papers, I just relax before my kid gets up.  At the time it was one kid.  So you're sitting there going, I only have maybe 90 minutes of free time in my whole weekend.  To me, it wasn't worth the time.  It's precious.  But if he hit somebody, if it was, if it was, if it was more of a crime, then yes, of course  I would have had to do something. 
[00:21:30]  You got to think path.  But I started, I started weighing it in my head.  I'm like, I don't want, I started getting mad.  I'm like, no, I'm not doing this.  You got to at least.  I'm not getting involved.  You got to write a note next time.  You just have to, just so that at least so the driver can do something.  I don't have a pen.  I don't have a paper.  I'm telling you, it's like six in the morning, just as the sun's coming up.  So it was in the summer, I guess.  And no one's around.  You're going to Starbucks.  So just write it on the back of a receipt and put it on the guy's windshield wiper.  Oh, God.  Goody two-shoes.  It's just a little note. 
[00:22:00]  I saw a guy fall asleep.  Who's with me?  Who wouldn't do anything in that situation?  I'm with both of you because I understand why you didn't because I would look at it and  go, ugh.  And then I understand what Sam is saying, too.  It would be 50-50.  One day, I would get the pen and go, fuck this, because I can be very motivated.  And another day, if he ran over a fucking infant, I would just go, ugh.  It's not my business.  I probably wouldn't do it, but I was in the exact same situation.  Somebody hit my car while it was parked, and somebody left a note with the guy's license  plate, and I was very happy.  And you called? 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  What happened when you got the guy?  Did he get on it?  We filed out a police report.  What was his answer?  A whole bunch of stuff.  Oh.  I'm still waiting to hear back.  I do have another situation, and it probably weighed on why I didn't do anything in this  situation.  I just remember this.  Also, quickly, just to wrap that part of it up, the car was a little shitty, too, that  he hit.  Yeah, but that means the guy probably has no cash to fix it.  Yeah, but who cares?  He does.  It's his car.  It wasn't a brand new car.  It wasn't a brand new car, either.  It's his ride.  It wasn't like a hard-working stiff that got some money together and got a nice car payment 
[00:23:00]  going.  It was kind of a crappier car, too.  He needs to...  I mean, he can't...  So I'm thinking...  No, the car was drivable, still.  I'm sure it was drivable, but there's a van dent in the back of it.  I remember this.  Now, this goes back...  Before I had kids, I was out with my now wife, and we were walking back to my apartment  when I lived somewhere else down a side street.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  That's not right.  I'm trying to remember this because I haven't thought about this in a while. 
[00:23:30]  I was parking.  Okay.  I was parking down a side street.  I was trying to find parking.  And I saw this old guy with his older wife trying to parallel park and take out a motorcycle.  Completely take it out.  Like, they back up into motorcycles all the time in New York City.  The bike was still standing, but it had significant damage.  Oh, it didn't get knocked over?  I saw this go down, and I confronted the guy.  And I did get involved, right?  And I'm like, what the hell? 
[00:24:00]  And he's trying to walk away from the situation.  I did write his license plate down, right?  Mm-hmm.  He walks into the building, and I'm having a conversation with this guy,  and he's, like, getting mad at me because I saw what he did.  He turns around, comes back, and he goes,  know what I'm going to do?  And he points right in my face.  He had to be, like, pushing 70.  He goes, know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to tell him you did it.  And then writes my license plate down.  Wow.  And he was going to leave a note saying,  this is the car that hit your fucking motorcycle. 
[00:24:30]  What a piece of shit.  He was a complete piece of shit.  That's a great example of why you don't get involved.  So now I'm like, holy fuck, I've got to move my car.  Well, he's a dickhead, but you could do it without a confrontation.  So I'm...  Yeah, like, without telling him.  Yeah.  That's the way to do it,  without telling the guy who did it that you're going to do it.  Probably.  But I saw it all go down, and I got so fucking pissed  that this guy backed right up into this guy's motorcycle  and wasn't going to do anything.  Yeah.  And then he goes, I'm going to tell him you did it.  And then writes my license plate down. 
[00:25:00]  I'm like, what?  You're fucking insane.  I didn't do this.  I'm surprised you didn't fight him at that point.  Well, I've had a few fistfights on the streets.  I'm trying to be better.  Yeah, but when he's like, I'm blaming you.  I know you didn't do it, but you are going to get blamed for it.  And he did it exactly like that.  He really got to me.  He's like, I'm going to tell him you did it.  I'm like, what?  Because I'm pointing out that you're an asshole?  Yeah.  He's like, what are you going to do?  So, long story short, this is many years,  but I do remember that I had to move my car  and now find another spot.  And it's not easy to find spots.  Thank you. 
[00:25:30]  Travis knows.  It's almost impossible.  So, I finally found a spot.  I'm like, fuck, I can't park anywhere near this motorcycle now.  And then I remember going back and there was a note.  And he did do the right thing.  I don't have a great end to the story.  He did do the right thing and say, you know,  I hit your motorcycle.  Here's my phone number.  Maybe he fucking left a fake number.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But he didn't have my license plate on the fucking note that he left.  You probably made him feel bad.  But at first, he's like, I'm telling him, you did it.  I'm like, what?  Like a little kid.  He got defensive at first and then he felt bad.  So, he's like, okay. 
[00:26:00]  He was obviously drunk and just backed right into his fucking motorcycle.  And that also goes to show how hard parking is to find  because anyone else would have backed into a motorcycle  and then found parking somewhere else.  Right.  You don't just stay there, you know?  No, no.  He parked it.  Yeah.  He parked it.  I would have just left.  Pretty much right next to the motorcycle.  I'm like, hey.  I go, hey.  What are you doing?  He just backed into a motorcycle.  So, I remember that and that's probably why I didn't get involved with this thing.  Yeah.  Because it always doesn't work out in your favor.  The only way to do it.  Next thing you know, they're pointing fingers at you going, 
[00:26:30]  oh, maybe you hit this fucking car.  That's true.  You don't want to be a witness to something and then you're a suspect.  Right.  I found, you know, I'm trying to think of when I did it.  But when you're trying to stop something from happening,  like a fight on the street,  I think the way to approach it,  and again, a crazy person is a crazy person,  but if it's with two people,  both who are fairly rational or just acting crazy,  the way to approach it is like,  even if it's a guy hitting a woman or a guy going to hit another guy,  instead of siding with the victim and going, 
[00:27:00]  hey, you can't hurt that person  because now you're making yourself a target.  Yeah.  You come at it from the angle of like,  you know, dude, hey, the cops have been called.  You're going to go to jail.  Just fucking get the fuck out of here.  Just stop it.  Right.  I think there's a different way to approach it.  Like a lot of people approach it like in a confrontational way.  So now you just make yourself the target, which is stupid.  Yeah.  I'm pretty good at avoiding that stuff.  I haven't been beaten up in probably my whole life.  I think I was confrontational.  I think I remember. 
[00:27:30]  I think I was confrontational with the older guy, but I was pissed.  I'm like, seriously, you just took out this motorcycle  and you're just going to walk away without doing anything?  I'll never stop a fight and I'll never actually confront someone.  I'm a pussy.  But if there's a way to do it without involving anyone,  then I'll do it.  I'll write a note or I'll call or whatever.  Let me go to Brett in New Jersey.  Brett.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, so I'm in college.  It's about 20 years ago.  It's 1 in the morning.  I'm sitting out on my balcony and I'm smoking some substances 
[00:28:00]  that weren't being legal at the time.  And I look down into the parking lot and I see this big-ass red Ford truck  smacking into three or four cars in the parking lot.  So at the time, I figured I wasn't going to call the cops  just because I didn't want them to really question what I saw,  nor did I want to get in trouble for said substances.  So the next morning, I see the guys out there checking out their cars.  I walk over and I say, listen, I saw what happened last night,  but I didn't want to call because I was a little bit under the influence.  So did. 
[00:28:30]  Next thing you know, the cops are in my house.  They're taking the report.  And about two weeks later, I'm subpoenaed to show up in court  to testify against this guy.  They tracked him down.  They found the damage on his car.  They found the pin on his car.  Yeah, now it's a big waste of time for you.  I'm taking off from college classes to go to court  to testify against this guy.  But yeah, it's a weird thing, man.  Like the inconvenience and stuff like that,  like smaller towns, they always say that people in the city are so,  you guys are so detached from everything. 
[00:29:00]  And there's a part of them that's right  because you get involved in every weird thing you see.  You're going to do nothing but get involved in weird shit  because there's always something.  If it's not something like this guy's talking about,  it's a homeless guy yelling at somebody  or it's somebody bumping into somebody's car.  There's always some shit happening that you can fucking,  you would lose a lot of your day  if you were just constantly being involved with other people's fuck-ups.  It is exhausting to live in New York City.  There's always something going on.  And you're always afraid.  Always.  You're going to, A, get swallowed up  by this fucking awful, giant, fucking anonymous place. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  And, B, that somebody's going to murder you.  Yep.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tony in Brooklyn.  Thank God I found a couple people  that did the exact same thing I did.  Here's one.  Tony in Brooklyn, go ahead.  About six weeks ago, I was driving on Bowery,  heading north to the Midtown Tunnel to go back out of the city.  And it's like 3 o'clock in the afternoon,  and I had, like, so much shit to do.  I watched this Chinaman walk across the street,  and this black BMW goes, boom, hits the guy.  The guy goes six feet in the air over the BMW, 
[00:30:00]  and then just skids on the pavement.  I was like, holy fuck, man.  I'll never get out of here if I don't get the fuck out of here.  One, for the traffic that that whole thing costs,  because I just, like, kind of rolled by him.  And two, I just want to stop and get a cop.  I figured somebody else will take care of it.  Wait, the guy was walking, or he hit him with a car?  The Chinaman was walking, and he got hit by a BMW.  This guy's in a car, and he's thinking to himself,  fuck, this is going to take all day.  So he rolled out of the situation. 
[00:30:30]  But he did say something that a lot of us do say,  somebody else will take care of it.  A guy getting hit by a car, I think I would always stop for that.  I would have to stop for that, to be honest with you.  A guy getting almost killed?  But the logic is there, Tony.  I hear you.  A lot of people would go, you know what?  Someone else will take care of this.  I know someone else will.  It's a crowded area.  Especially in New York City.  Right.  Do you know what, though?  There's probably at least 20 witnesses.  I could roll out of this situation and not, you know, waste my entire day.  I think all of us are like that,  because that's why when someone does something, we call them a hero. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  We don't say guy does regular things.  We're like, oh, my God, somebody helped.  Right.  You just assume someone will help, and, you know,  if there's a lot of people around, the odds are, yes,  a lot of people are going to fucking help.  Hey, Jimmy, to your point about getting in the fight,  I was coming out of the ski bar, which used to be on 92nd and 6,  like 20 years ago.  I'm sorry, 92nd.  And some guy was beating the shit out of his girl.  So my buddy went up to him and said, blah, blah, blah, you know, 
[00:31:30]  just ends up like, shit.  Next thing you know, I'm like, 12 guys come flying up a lot.  And we get in a fight.  It's three on 12.  And I have to go to work with a shiner and a busted nose on Monday.  Yeah.  It was like fight club.  Did your friend get involved aggressively, though?  Or did he go, come on, man, stop this shit?  Or did he?  No, no.  He's like, oh, you like hitting girls?  I was like, shit, fucking hit.  And he yoked them. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  And, you know, five minutes later, 12 guys come flying up the block.  And now I look like fight club on Monday morning.  Okay.  Yeah, that's not the way to approach it.  You like hitting girls is not the way to approach it.  Because you don't know what she did.  She made it hit him first.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Listen, have a good day.  All right, man.  There you go.  You try to stop it and go, look, just don't do this here.  What are you doing?  You're in the street.  Don't do it here.  Yeah.  And then just to stop it from happening at that moment.  Just don't do it in front of my face.  Or just, yeah.  But you try to tap into, again, unless they're a maniac, 
[00:32:30]  the self-interest of the person doing the horrible thing.  Because even if you throw in a beating, nobody wants to get arrested and go to jail.  Most people don't want that.  That guy saw a Chinaman get hit by a BMW and just assumed someone else would take care of the situation.  That's the same thinking, like you said.  Everybody thinks that, well, somebody else is going to say something, so I don't need to.  But they will.  But they might not.  I started this conversation when an old lady falls, and it happens a lot in New York City, you know.  You look around, like, okay, she's got it. 
[00:33:00]  She's got it.  She's okay.  Even though I probably should have been the first responder, I'm like, wait a minute.  If I just wait a few seconds.  Okay, she's got it.  Good.  But there are multiple famous rape cases where literally dozens of people heard women screaming,  and nobody called anyone, because they all assumed the other person would.  I don't know about that.  It's true.  Man, I mean, but every time you try to stop one of these things, you're putting your life in danger, too.  And then if you add to the fact that you have kids or something.  All you got to do is call. 
[00:33:30]  Your mindset changes, man.  Go far away from the scenario and just call the police.  If you see something, say something.  That's right.  If you see something.  Well, I saw something.  Say something.  But you didn't say nothing.  I felt bad for the guy that was asleep.  You said, whoa.  And the other thing was just a car.  I didn't know that person.  It was just their car.  Yeah, but if you woke up and your car was smashed, you'd be fucking heated.  Of course.  So why couldn't you see, like, place that emotion onto this other person and be like,  I would want somebody to help me out.  I'm going to help them out. 
[00:34:00]  Do unto others?  That's right.  That's right, Travis.  Let's say hi to Jim in New York.  Jim.  Hey, buddy.  I'm right here.  Jim.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  What's up, buddy?  So I'm taking a cab across town the other day, as I do every day.  Oh, a rich guy doesn't need the train.  Sorry.  I'm actually parked in my car right now, about to get me a cab.  And we make a right, and my cab driver absolutely plows into another cab who's just kind of sitting in the middle of the road.  And I literally unbelt, get out, and walk away smiling. 
[00:34:30]  Didn't pay a red cent.  Didn't get halfway to where I was going, and I'm like, fuck this.  Oops, sorry.  I am not hanging around waiting to deal with two cabbies.  Yeah.  Who knows?  They got licenses.  I'm not going to spend the next two hours of my day sitting here waiting for the cops to show up for this.  I am like, no chance in the world.  But it was amazing, because it took two tenths of a second for my brain to realize all of this and know all of this.  That's different.  And you're bringing up a situation that happens a lot in New York City.  Yes, you'll see two cabs or a cab hit anything else, and you see that person still hanging out in the cab. 
[00:35:00]  I'm like, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of there.  You're going to wait around as they file police reports and shit?  Well, I've got to pay my fare.  Yeah, what cracks me up, though, is it took two tenths of a second for my mind to know, open the door, walk away, leave, don't even pay, who cares?  And I was gone.  See, I brought up an ugly situation today, but it is part of human nature.  There's a lot of people that definitely look at the situation and think, hmm, is it worth my time? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Here's another.  Thank you, sir.  You can't actually think about what you're doing with your time, because it's always useless.  Like, you're just going in the coffee.  You're going to get coffee and read a paper.  To me, that wasn't useless.  That's what I'm trying to say.  To me, it's everything to have just a couple hours in the morning to chill out.  And to the guy, you thought his bumper was everything, but now it's all smushed.  But then I felt bad for the guy that was asleep.  Why?  Because he looked like a hardworking guy, and he probably couldn't afford an insurance situation. 
[00:36:00]  What if he was drunk on the job?  He probably wasn't even insured.  He could probably afford a cup of coffee to drive home and keep himself awake.  I don't know.  It didn't look like that.  Will in Wisconsin.  What's up, Will?  Yeah, the one that I saw, I was sitting at a red light with another guy, and this car blows  a red light, a little Toyota Corolla, gets T-boned by an Oldsmobile.  A Russian lady with her kid in the car.  She jumps out.  She's screaming and hollering and rushing, worried about her kid.  The guy in the Corolla got bounced around in the Corolla. 
[00:36:30]  We go running over to that guy because we could see that he was in bad shape.  He was bleeding.  You know, we opened up the car door.  The car stunk of alcohol.  So we're looking for something to mop up the blunt because his eyebrow is hanging down over his eye and shit.  And we grabbed his keys and opened up the truck, and there's a cop uniform and a gun in the truck  of the town that we live in, or that I live in.  And me and this dude just looked at each other, looked over at the Russian lady who, by this time,  the son is trying to console her, and just said, fuck it. 
[00:37:00]  We're out of here because I don't want to be a part of this shit.  And we just left him sitting there and took off.  A part of what, though?  It's two questions.  Yeah, but it's a local cop in a small town.  That's a plot of a movie.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, but I wouldn't go as far as this guy did.  He panicked a little bit.  I wouldn't go and run and open up the car door and try to, like, clean up the body of somebody.  Like, what is he doing?  He's trying to help.  I mean, you want to talk about getting involved too much. 
[00:37:30]  You call 911 and say, there was an accident.  I'm leaving.  It was before cell phones, man.  There was no cell phones.  Yeah, it's easier with cell phones now.  We were trying to help the guy.  I mean, he was bleeding.  He was kind of out of it, but I think he was more drunk than anything.  And like I said, once we saw the uniform, it was like, no, I ain't going to get involved with this because the cops are cops.  They follow the thin blue line.  They watch out for each other.  And I live in that town.  There was no way in hell I was going to get involved in that. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  There's logic there.  You get a little nervous, right?  Hell yeah.  All right, buddy.  Have a good day.  Thank you, man.  Phones are lit.  People love not helping other people.  I knew I wasn't the only one.  I get the instinct, but I think I would...  You've got to try to do at least the bare minimum.  Because otherwise nobody's going to help you out.  Well, they don't.  I don't know if karma means anything, because if it did, this guy wouldn't have gotten thrown to his death. 
[00:38:30]  Karma's shit.  It's like, no matter how good you are, you get fucked over.  I don't believe in karma.  Yeah, I guess, I don't know.  But you can't expect people to help you then.  Like...  I don't expect anyone to help me?  Are you kidding me?  No, if you've got some shit happen to you.  Like, if you woke up and your car was smashed and there were people walking around, you'd be like, really?  Nobody saw this?  Yeah, I'd be pissed, but I wouldn't be surprised.  I wouldn't be surprised.  You'd still have that expectation that somebody should have done something.  No.  You're still young.  You'd be pissed.  That's what the pissed is. 
[00:39:00]  That's what your youth is, because you expected something else.  I'm going to tell you this much.  It all started with the front page of the New York Post.  If you're just tuning in, I tweeted the picture of the front page.  A guy that's going to get killed by a subway, he got pushed onto the tracks.  Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die.  I'm going to tell you this much.  This photographer is in a bit of trouble.  You think so?  Yeah, this story's going to develop a little bit.  He's going to be in trouble.  Why? 
[00:39:30]  He's going to be questioning, like, you're taking pictures instead of helping this guy.  We need to know a little more here.  I'm not saying in the end he's going to have a problem, but you watch.  There's going to be questions about this photographer.  I was questioning him, too, until I saw the faraway shot where the fucking animal who threw this guy onto the tracks is standing.  To get to the guy, the photographer would have had to put himself at the end by the tracks next to the guy who pushed him.  I don't blame the photographer.  Although, like, in this shot here, the guy's gone who pushed him. 
[00:40:00]  I don't know if he's gone.  They said in the article he left after he pushed him.  Oh, okay.  He pushed him and then he left.  This photographer...  So they could have got him off.  If I know a photographer, he can't be more than 15 feet away.  So, yeah, he was trying to get the picture.  20 feet away.  Yes.  Does that help him?  And there's one shot where you see the lights of the subway train.  It's still pretty far down the tracks.  I mean, you don't have a lot of time, but you do have a shot of getting to this guy.  And that's a steady shot.  He's not moving. 
[00:40:30]  Like, he's not walking towards the guy.  He's in his position.  Yes, he is.  15 feet away from him, like you said.  All I'm saying is this story's going to develop a little bit.  People are going to question, you know, what the fuck with this photographer.  You had time to shoot a perfect news shot.  Although it will go viral.  This picture?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, it will.  It'll be everywhere today.  It leads me to a show I got turned on to on HBO called Witness.  Have you seen Witness yet? 
[00:41:00]  I have not, no.  It's journalists and photographers in these just insane places.  And the one I'm watching right now is Libya.  I'm only halfway through it.  Wow.  Guy is just brave enough.  He's an American, so he sticks out.  And he goes to Libya to cover the uprising.  And he was there when, you know, they caught Gaddafi and all that.  And then he goes back after the Gaddafi thing and just starts taking pictures of everything.  And you learn that Libya is still completely fucked up. 
[00:41:30]  Those guys have a certain, there's a bravery to war correspondents that, even though the media stinks,  those guys have balls, man.  I mean, they put their lives in harm's way.  I'm watching this going.  I can't even imagine what type of person it takes to go over to Libya as an American and go, you know what?  I got to take pictures of what's going on here.  It's unbelievable.  And he's interviewing people.  And a lot of locals are like, look, we all hated fucking Gaddafi.  He ruled with an iron fist for 42 years. 
[00:42:00]  They go, but at least we were allowed to live.  Because the current situation right now, they're still trying to figure out who's going to control Libya.  And they're basically hinting, we hated the fucking guy, but at least we were able to live.  Now they don't know what the fuck's going to happen, which I thought was interesting.  And then the guy interviews a father who lost his baby.  And as a father, it just killed me.  He's like, yeah, you know, my wife was just upstairs giving the kids a bath. 
[00:42:30]  And the house got hit with some water and took out my fucking baby.  And I'm like, fuck, people just want to fucking live in general.  Right.  You know, without all that political shit.  I don't feel like getting into it.  But, you know, there's a mom doing the right thing, just fucking giving her kid a bath and loses her son.  This kid was, this guy was so distraught.  But the show's called Witness.  It's amazing.  It's fucking amazing.  Yeah, this is the one I saw.  And then they discover, like, all the weaponry and stuff that Gaddafi was, you know, collecting. 
[00:43:00]  Instead of taking care of his people.  Spent a lot of money on arms.  Look at this guy.  He looks exactly, he looks like an American.  He would stand out.  Completely putting his life at risk.  Could he go back?  Sure.  What is this, the promo for the series?  Yeah.  It's definitely worth taking a look at.  Look at these pictures, Jimmy.  I think a war photographer, they can go to combat. 
[00:43:30]  It's the conflict that I'm interested in.  Once you get in those trucks, you're going where the fighters go.  The front line.  What I find interesting is from people who say, stop.  This one, this lady went to the sedan.  I'm going to fight.  Raise your weapon.  Raise your weapon.  And it's over. 
[00:44:00]  Good afternoon.  For the last seven years, I've been in the bush chasing after coins.  Welcome to Libya.  Craziest country on earth.  It's a night man.  An absolute night man.  8,000 soldiers in Juarez.  They're just another gang.  I'm more afraid of the police than I am about the youngsters around here. 
[00:44:30]  Rio.  Pictures we take have consequences.  Someone's going to get killed for that.  For sure.  This guy's crazy.  And then they show a white lady in the sedan.  She's nuts.  Yeah.  Just so she could document what's going on over there.  But I didn't want to leave.  If somebody is dying in front of you, and you can do something, Justin, don't fall asleep. 
[00:45:00]  As a drone, you should not do it.  As a human being, what do you do?  We're getting into worlds that we're not supposed to be in.  We're not supposed to see.  I don't know.  I just started this.  I'm only halfway through Libya.  But this documentary series on HBO called Witness is definitely worth a peek.  HBO documentaries are amazing.  They're amazing.  Maybe we could get someone from Witness on the show. 
[00:45:30]  One of the photographers?  It was a white lady in a sedan.  Sticking out like a sore thumb.  I don't even understand.  They almost, though, when you're like that and you're the media,  you're such a reporter that I think that they see you as a way to get their message out.  It's weird how reporters...  But if you take the wrong shot where someone goes,  What the fuck?  You're making our side look bad right now.  I feel like you could be in danger.  And the stories hit the news that, you know, you lose journalists all the time.  Occasionally.  But they much more get away with it than they don't. 
[00:46:00]  You think?  Yeah.  Like when there's footage of...  Who was it that interviewed the Ayatollah when he was on...  Was it Dan Rather?  It was one of those guys who was interviewing him.  And he said...  Now I'm quoting.  And he kind of apologized for asking.  It might have been Mike Wallace from 60 Minutes.  Yeah, I think it was Mike Wallace.  Where he said, whoever it was said that you are a maniac.  And he kind of apologized because it was a very disrespectful question.  But I forget who it was that interviewed Bin Laden.  Like they, I think, hooded the journalist so he didn't know where he was going. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  This is before 9-11.  Sure.  But these guys get weird access to people.  And where they should be killed and you think they'd be killed but they're not.  Yeah.  Oh, that's the...  Yeah.  It's you, Imam.  Forgive me.  His words, not mine.  A lunatic.  I know that you have heard that comment.  He's waiting for the translator.  That's...  Yes.  That's what I heard President Sadat say on American television. 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  That the Imam is a disgrace to Islam.  Yes.  And he used the word a lunatic.  Sadat states he is a Muslim.  And we are not.  He is not.  For he compromises with the enemies of Islam.  See how he answers the question though? 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  But you see how smart he was?  Because the Ayatollahs fucking didn't play games.  You can see Mike Wallace.  It almost looks like he's gulping.  And he called you a...  But then he said disgrace to Islam.  Right.  A lunatic.  Oh.  That takes balls.  Yeah.  Wow.  You're telling the Ayatollah that someone called him a lunatic.  Oh my God.  That's crazy.  Let's see.  Yeah.  People still have stories about helping and what that meant and all that. 
[00:48:00]  It's called the bystander effect.  The concept in social psychology using anonymity and the diffusion of responsibility.  This was named after the murder of Kitty Genovese.  That's the thing.  In Kew Gardens in 1964.  Also known as the Genovese Syndrome.  I believe that's the woman that was raped, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they said at the time that a hundred people were witnesses to the rape.  And no one did anything.  Yeah.  So they called it the Genovese Syndrome. 
[00:48:30]  Which is what?  They were witnessing the rape.  Where were they?  They heard it.  They saw it.  They saw it through their windows.  It happened in an alley.  And everybody either heard or saw it.  And everybody said, well, somebody in the other apartment will say something.  I don't want to get involved, blah, blah, blah.  And so nobody said anything.  See, I think a lot of people just assume that.  Right.  Absolutely.  But nobody says anything sometimes.  Right.  Which is the problem.  You just assume, okay, someone absolutely is better than me and will fucking do the right 
[00:49:00]  thing.  That's right.  I have a degree in sociology.  I know a lot of stuff.  Do you really?  Uh-huh.  I had to get out of school quick.  What?  That's why I got the degree in sociology, so I could get out of school quicker.  I love sociology.  Sociology.  Yeah.  There's no issue.  Sociology.  All right.  We should break here.  Eat some stuff.  Eat some stuff.  We got Martin Freeman today, who was Bilbo Baggins in The New Hobbit.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  And he was great.  And he's Tim from The Original Office.  He was absolutely great in The Hobbit.  I heard Ron Bennington didn't like The Hobbit.  Oh, no?  Did he see it?  I don't know.  I fucking tweeted, I loved it, and someone goes, oh, that's interesting, because Ron Bennington  hated it.  I don't know.  Is he playing corny, or did he actually see the film?  I haven't heard his opinion on it.  Or is that guy just starting shit?  There's a great possibility of that.  That the guy's just starting shit?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Larry King and Andrew Dice Clay in studio next week, I see? 
[00:50:00]  All right.  Yes.  All right, then.  All right.  We'll have fun with that.  Take us to break there, E-Rock.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What happened?  I left the studio, and I come back, and it felt a little tense in here.  Because I'm complaining again about the prep sheet.  I know you guys are sick of hearing it.  I don't care.  Right. 
[00:50:30]  Martin Freeman's coming in today, and we got a one sheet on him.  Mm-hmm.  We got some good stuff on here, right?  Yeah.  Again, I understand you have to talk about The Hobbit, because that's what he's promoting.  Of course you do.  The first bullet point, he is the lead role of Bilbo Baggins.  I didn't know that.  In Peter Jackson's adaption, Peter Jackson's three-part adaption of The Hobbit alongside  Ian McGillan.  Right.  Next line.  Who plays Gandalf, by the way.  Gandalf.  Next line is The Hobbit.  An unexpected journey and The Hobbit.  The desolation of the smog, wrapped on July 6, 2012, after 266 days of principal photography. 
[00:51:00]  The next one.  Won a BAFTA TV Award for Best Supporting Actor for Sherlock 2011.  Okay.  I understand why you'd put that.  The first two points could have been, I think, fucking kind of pushed down into a smaller,  you know.  Condensed.  Yeah.  The third one is Tim Canterbury on The Office.  He received two Best Comedy.  Okay.  Great.  And the next one.  Four lines on this.  The Hobbit is the first feature film to be shot and projected at 48 frames per second. 
[00:51:30]  HPR.  HFR.  High frame rate.  Enhances picture quality.  Reduces strobing and motion picture blur in action sequences.  Making the film look closer to what the human eye actually sees.  Tim.  Comment.  There's Martin, but you know.  And again, it's like...  It's a new technology, though.  I understand.  People need to know it's a new technology.  But I get why we're being given this information.  There has to be a point.  I understand that it's...  Right.  It is...  We're promoting this film and they have to tell us about it. 
[00:52:00]  Sure.  But I also understand, because I went to school, what it is like to put a lot of words on the  page to fill the page.  Oh, shit.  Who does the prep sheet these days?  It's Sal.  Sal does.  I don't care.  I like Sal, but it's like this prep sheet shit I've been screaming about for a long time.  It's a...  To interview somebody and be interesting...  Look, we have 15 minutes with him.  I'm not saying we're doing a fucking four-hour miniseries on Martin Freeman.  You've got to find those little hidden gems.  Those little hidden nuggets.  Yeah, just something interesting about him personally. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Or a couple of little things about him personally.  Right.  I don't know what he would say about the high frame rate thing.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  Did you notice that when you were shooting?  He probably would say, yeah, it's really cool and it really enhanced the film.  That looks really great.  And the viewing experience for the moviegoer.  I guess I should...  Because people are getting sick.  Did you hear about that?  What?  People are getting sick watching it.  You know what?  I felt nauseous watching it.  Get out of here.  Yeah, there's articles coming out.  Yeah.  That's the talking point. 
[00:53:00]  People are getting sick.  Why?  From what?  The new frame rate.  No, I get it.  They're just not used to seeing it.  What part of the movie?  The fight sequences?  Yeah, the speed, the 3D effects.  It's making people nauseous.  Dizzy.  Oh, a bunch of pussies.  Then go see it without 3D.  Yeah, people are complaining about feeling sick and dizzy after watching early screenings of The Hobbit.  That's a compliment to the film.  I felt the same way for a few minutes.  You felt that?  Yes.  I didn't feel that.  That's a compliment because it feels like you're moving. 
[00:53:30]  That's such a compliment to the way it's shot.  It's like what...  What's it called?  Cloverfield did to people.  Cloverfield made me extremely sick.  Yeah.  But that was just fucked up.  And they messed up a good movie, by the way, by doing that.  By going with that concept, the handheld shit that's shaking.  Right.  They fucked it up because the movie itself could have been really, really cool.  I like the handheld stuff.  In Cloverfield?  Mm-hmm.  Through the whole movie?  Yep.  That was...  Nah.  I liked the whole thing.  It's what made it different. 
[00:54:00]  Otherwise, it would have just been Godzilla.  Which is fine.  But I already saw Godzilla.  The monster was fucking cool.  And the little monsters that live on the big monster.  Yeah, it was awesome.  And them running through the subway tunnels and all that was great.  But they still allowed you to get a shot of the monster.  Barely.  And they gave you shots of the monsters.  My problem with Cloverfield was they did the whole movie that way.  They could have went to that handheld a little bit here and there to enhance it, yes.  But the whole movie was shot that way.  It sucked.  I liked it.  I mean, again, I was so sick.  Half the time, I was looking down at my feet. 
[00:54:30]  And I told this story recently.  That was one movie I went with Patrice.  We went to the screening there.  It's funny.  I think there was ten of us in the whole theater or something.  Jeffrey Lyons was there.  Yeah, he was.  Well, that's what I'm going to bring up.  And all of a sudden, the movie ends and Patrice goes, what did he say exactly?  Boo?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He went, boo!  And stupid Jeffrey Lyons, who's this snooty movie reviewer here in New York City.  Is he national?  I don't even know.  He turns to Patrice and goes, no one asked you!  All pissed off. 
[00:55:00]  Which made Patrice's day.  Oh, then Patrice had that over-the-top laugh that he does.  And then he started pointing, like, ah!  I'm writing Jeffrey Lyons, and Jeffrey Lyons didn't know what the fuck to do.  But yeah, they're saying, like, people are tweeting, it works for the big snowy mountains,  but in close-ups, the picture strobes, I left the movie feeling sick.  And I didn't feel that at all.  I felt it, but I felt a little queasy.  And I knew what it was, though.  I'm like, this motion, it's just what you're not used to. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  Okay.  Fair enough.  But that's something.  Some people are getting migraines.  Yeah, we can definitely talk about that.  And we also learned on The Hobbit, it's due to be completed literally two days before the premiere, hopefully,  Peter Jackson is quoted as saying.  But that already happened.  So why is that on the sheet?  It's true.  I mean, obviously, it's done.  You saw it.  I saw it.  So it's due to be completed literally two days before the premiere, hopefully. 
[00:56:00]  That's a non-point, because we now know, because we're living in the future, that they did complete it.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's completed.  It's definitely coming out.  Right.  How's Nicole from the morning mashup?  Is she cool today?  I'll find out.  Thumbs up!  She's thumbs up today.  All right.  She had some problems yesterday.  Hold me a minute.  She's still a little heavy-eyed.  In other news, Caden, and what's his name there, Prince William?  Yeah.  They're going to have a baby, so the whole world is like, oh, yay, baby for them. 
[00:56:30]  I can't even believe it.  It's questionable enough that England gets into the royal family.  What's our interest in it?  I don't know.  What's America's interest in the British royal family?  I don't know.  Ask the women out there.  The women fucking eat this shit up.  Yeah, Jess told me last night when I got home, or when she got home.  Women love the royal family.  Did you hear Kate's pregnant?  No.  It's romantic.  That's why.  Because every girl wants to be a princess instead of just a dummy that fucking we wind  up treating them like.  They all want to be her. 
[00:57:00]  Just a princess whisked off on a cart and taken by a prince.  He's Prince Charming.  Right.  They all want Prince Charming.  And how do you think poor Jess feels?  Do you want Prince Charming?  No disrespect.  But you fucking walk in in boxer shorts.  That's not Prince Charming.  But Sam's related to Thomas Jefferson.  That's right.  That's real, right?  Of course it's real.  You should get a little more respect for that.  Prince Charming is balding severely.  And that's why I know you got part black in you.  Because of the Thomas Jefferson thing?  You think it was good?  Yeah, you're from that side of the family.  The slavery thing? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, the side they didn't invite to the picnics for many, many generations.  And they finally said, all right, you could join us.  Because don't they get together still every year?  The whole Jefferson clan?  I think so, but I don't get invited.  Why don't you guys get invited?  I don't know.  And how far back do we go where we get some real Jefferson shit in your family lineage?  I think it was a great, great, great, great, great, great, great, et cetera, uncle.  Uncle?  What do you mean?  Uncle?  Great, great, great, great, great uncle.  What's Thomas Jefferson?  Thomas Jefferson.  Great, great, great, great, great, great uncle. 
[00:58:00]  Is it your dad or your mom's side?  On my dad's side.  That's why he likes all that shit in his house, right?  What shit?  Buttermilk and shit?  Yeah, he's like old school.  Yeah.  He's traditional.  Miles Standish is on his side.  Captain of the Mayflower.  Oh, yeah.  I know who Miles Standish is.  Yeah.  I mean, I know his name.  I didn't know he was Captain of the Mayflower, so I kind of lied.  So you got some good lineage.  What the fuck happened to you?  I'm still building.  Like you said, I'm still young.  You're just a radio guy.  You're not young.  You're fucking 30.  What are you waiting for?  You're right.  I'm building.  Building toward what?  An empire.  Yeah, but you're related to a president. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  Well, I mean, that's out of the picture since there's audio of me.  Does your dad take it seriously?  Blowing E-Rock.  Not super seriously.  My dad thinks very highly of himself, so ancestors are no ancestors.  He knows he's the man.  But you know you're part black.  I know he did the testing and all, and it came back negative or whatever, but you're part black.  I mean, if you're related to Thomas Jefferson and you got these weird black features, you got to think that you're part black. 
[00:59:00]  I mean, you could be the lightest black man ever.  It's true.  Ever to walk this earth.  There's nothing Caucasian about my hair.  I'll give you that.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Or your musical taste.  Except for Rob Zombie.  Or the brows.  It's like a thick brow, a black eye thing.  You always say that.  That's not even a black eye thing.  That goes back like 100,000 years.  That's like a fucking...  That's caveman-ish.  Yeah, that's caveman-ish.  That's neanderthal-ish.  Right.  Is that a good thing?  No.  Oh.  And then you got giant, like, feet.  I get...  You got big flipper feet. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  You're like a cross between a white guy, a black guy, a neanderthal, and a platypus.  You're just a fucking...  You're just a petri dish of mediocrity.  Where were we?  There was a point to this whole thing.  Thomas Jefferson, The Hobbit, fucking Dizzy.  I don't know.  You're pissed about the prep sheet.  Huh?  Oh, I know what it was.  So, yeah.  Yeah, women love the royal family.  Guys can't stand it.  It doesn't make any sense.  Why? 
[01:00:00]  Like, because it's not a real prince and princess.  They're not doing anything.  And Prince William is not like, you know...  Like, he looks like he's going to be Prince Charles when he gets older.  He's not a handsome guy.  The only thing he's got going for him is he was born into this family.  Yeah.  They're all, for the most part, just a bunch of zeros that don't really know how to do  anything.  They've never had to do anything.  They just got to show up at events and look good.  Yeah, they know how to wear a suit.  But if you challenge them on anything, I don't even know...  What are their expertise?  Like, Prince Charles, what is he good at? 
[01:00:30]  He shoots those plates that they throw in the air.  Seriously, that's all you know about him, right?  And he rides a horse every once in a while and plays that polo.  Right.  What is he good at?  You can't challenge them.  Nothing.  Like, you can't challenge the royal family.  That's treason.  No, they're just a figurehead.  Oh, we can challenge them.  Well, yeah, we can.  I'm saying in England.  You can't do anything to us.  You can't go face to face.  What is Prince William good at?  I want an answer today.  They're just seen as, I guess, spokespeople for the nation.  They're probably good for tourism for England.  They're a big tourist attraction. 
[01:01:00]  But England should wake up and just say, look, enough of this crap.  We don't need them.  Yeah.  Would there be a big problem if they just shunned the royal family over there?  No, in a lot of ways they have.  Like, I don't know if they're being forced to pay taxes finally, but for years they didn't  pay any taxes.  Like, it really is just a waste.  Disgusting.  So, anyone else hoping that the baby turns out to be a dud?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Just to see what kind of people they really are.  How would they handle a dud? 
[01:01:30]  If you notice, there's never been a dud.  So, what goes on behind the castle walls to make sure there's no duds born?  You know there's some dark room that they hide them in if they get a dud.  The duds?  You think there's a dud room in the fucking castle?  A dungeon?  There's a dud wing.  The dud dungeon.  All the duds get locked away, and then they just work on the next one.  Big fucking water heads and fucking kids with fucking club feet.  Yeah.  Because, you know, it'll just show what kind of people they really are.  You're never going to see a dud. 
[01:02:00]  I think the queen is just...  I really dislike her because I think her personality stinks.  And this stoic, icy cold, emotionless...  She just seems like a privileged old twat.  Oh, absolutely.  She doesn't give a reaction.  Everyone tries and tries to get a reaction out of her, and she just stands there with her  stupid fucking purse.  Yeah.  I hate that whole thing.  Yeah, I can't stand it either.  At least probably Diana had a personality, and she was seen as warm and loving, and that's  why people liked her. 
[01:02:30]  And they were trying to change that whole thing.  You know, they wanted to go with that whole personality thing, and then, you know, and  then the queen moved there, had her killed.  It's obvious.  I think that's why people...  It's obvious she had her killed.  She hated the attention she was getting.  That's why the royal family didn't like Diana, right?  Because she was fucking...  She was liked, and she was seen as this...  And they're just these stoic shits.  Yeah.  Just worthless.  Look at her dopey hat.  Ah, she's awful.  That hat would look cool on Keith Richards, but not on the Queen Moon.  The Queen Moon.  She's been far too coddled and privileged for far too long. 
[01:03:00]  All that money wasted, it's just silly to me.  Now, this guy, he's going to buy into the myth, it looks like.  Wes in Ohio.  Wes?  Yeah.  Morning, boys.  I guess we asked the question, what is Prince William good at?  Not that I'm defending the royal family.  I really can't stand him either, but he is an attack helicopter pilot.  He has deployed several times to Afghanistan, and he has killed Taliban.  Isn't that Prince Harry?  That's Harry.  Wasn't it Harry?  Was that Harry?  Yeah, because they could lose Harry, especially at this point. 
[01:03:30]  It doesn't matter if he dies.  It would actually be cool for the royal family if Prince Harry died in a war.  Right.  But they would never allow Prince William to fucking fly attack helicopters.  No, Prince Harry is the one that doesn't give a fuck.  It's having a kid, that means Prince Harry is pushed way down the list of ever becoming  the king of England.  Yeah, it's not going to happen.  So now they're probably going to fucking kill him off, you know, just to...  They're just going to kill him to kill him?  Oh, yeah.  I think that shit happens all the time.  Just because they don't want a spare prince just mucking about? 
[01:04:00]  No, it just looks good for the royal family.  Like, look, we're regular people.  See, we sent one of our sons to war and he died.  We deal with tragedy, too.  Right, exactly.  Well, that would be too big of a victory for the Taliban if they killed someone in royalty.  That would be a big moral victory.  It might not even be that.  It might be just something stupid, you know, but, you know, he...  He died in training.  Died in training.  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  Friendly fire.  He had gout.  He died of gout.  Yeah.  What the fuck is gout?  I never want gout.  I think it's when you get, like, uh... 
[01:04:30]  I don't know, actually.  We looked at it.  I think it's in your foot.  I think it's in your foot.  Is it only in your foot, though?  Or is it when it's in your foot?  No, man.  It could hit your, like, your wrist.  It could hit anywhere, and it just blows up parts of your body.  Yeah, it looks like...  I never want gout.  No, gout suck.  What exactly...  But why do you get it?  What is it?  Yeah, it's not good.  No.  No, no, it's not.  It's not something you hope for.  But it's based on what?  Your immune system gets a little weak for what reason?  It's a...  Why are we talking about gout?  I don't know.  It's the beauty of the show. 
[01:05:00]  Usually characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis.  A red, tender, hot, swollen joint.  Oh, God, that sounds horrendous.  Can you imagine, like, fucking 500 years ago, dealing with gout?  Like, sometimes I think of what they had to deal with, as bad as things are now.  Right.  Just to be in, like, you know, the 1400s, and there's no internal medicine at all.  There's no anesthesia.  You just hope.  Yeah, if it wasn't something you could throw a bandage over, you would have fucked it.  Even that.  I bet you people were dying just because they had open wounds. 
[01:05:30]  Get infected, yeah, like civil war.  Of course, a dumb infection.  You're done.  Imagine having gout on your elbow, and then you do the funny bone thing.  You hit it all weird as you have that gout.  It bursts on the back of your fucking pants.  Right.  Your gout hurts.  This guy's saying that the other guy was right about Prince William.  Oh, okay.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve.  What's up?  Yes.  Hey, man.  My girlfriend's one of these that are obsessed with the royal family, and, you know, Prince  William tries to be all, like, you know, he tries to be, like, all humble about it. 
[01:06:00]  He tries to keep it under wraps, but he is, like, he's a patchy, I think it's a patchy  helicopter pilot, and he fought in the Middle East, and he does, like, rescue missions.  He tries to, like, apparently he tries to stay out of the limelight with it.  Like, he sneaks away and does, like, his time, and he does, like, rescue missions.  There was, like, a shipwreck.  I heard my girlfriend was watching this thing, and he rescued, like, 30 people using his  helicopter.  So, apparently, he's the real deal when it comes to that. 
[01:06:30]  Well, this is where I'm going to kind of teach you a little bit.  I think you're buying the company line.  Does he fly helicopters?  I believe so, but I don't think he's getting in the real shit.  And then when they got a mission, like, hey, man, we could send Prince William to save  some people in the middle of the ocean there, and there's no enemy around.  This is going to look good for him.  He's not allowed on active service in war zones.  I think they could definitely pull that off, but they're saying that he fought in the Middle  East.  I would love to talk to guys that are a little closer to the situation, and I bet you they 
[01:07:00]  would absolutely say that he's well-protected, and they give him missions that they know  are completely safe.  Of course.  That's probably true.  You know.  Thank you, sir.  And how obsessed with the royal family is your chick?  Oh, he's gone.  Because I had an ex-girlfriend that was obsessed with the royal family.  And when Princess Di died, she was in front of the TV for three straight days, and I'm  like, at one point, I just want to yell at her, get over it.  You're never going to be a princess. 
[01:07:30]  It's not going to happen.  But every Christmas, all I had to do was buy a dumb Princess Di book, and she was happy.  Would you have gotten her that thing?  Remember they sold on TV the fake Princess Di rings for like $50?  I didn't go that deep, but I wanted a shaker.  Like you shake a baby?  That's a...  Knock it off!  I want to say, look, I get it.  You want to be a princess.  Well, it's not happening.  Sounded like Florentine there for a second.  It's not happening.  Why?  You're not a princess.  You're not a princess. 
[01:08:00]  It's a problem.  You're going out with a shock jock.  How great is this?  Fucking Lindsay Lohan's bank account seized by the IRS.  Getting worse and worse.  She's just...  And it's probably not her fault, because you think your accountants are going to do the  right thing, but it's just...  But how much...  She's so hateable.  How much shit could one person take, though?  She's got the, as they like to say, the nine lives there.  They keep throwing shit at her, and she keeps bouncing back.  She owes $233,000.  That's a lot of money, but it's not a lot of money when you're on that level of... 
[01:08:30]  She's got to have it.  Yeah.  She probably has it somewhere, right?  Fucking that jewelry thing really annoys me.  It looks to me like she's just a little fucking...  A little thieving cunt.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't like her at all.  I don't give a fuck about her either.  This guy's going to tell us what Prince Charles did.  Because he's in the same boat.  What the fuck is he good at?  Go ahead, Carl.  Good morning, Opie.  Hey, buddy.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  I just want to say that Prince Charles is a cuckold.  What's that? 
[01:09:00]  Your phone cut out.  He's a cuckold.  Oh.  Yeah, he's a weirdo, man.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I mean, he wasn't into the Prince's Die, right?  He's probably...  You know what?  He was into the other one who was just...  Camilla Bowles.  Yeah.  Who's probably a better fuck, to be honest with you.  You think that's what it was about?  Yeah, he just didn't like...  Prince's Die, he married, but he probably...  She probably bored him, and he probably bored her.  Well, I bet she didn't like him.  I bet she like emasculated him, and didn't look up to him as the Prince, and just thought  he was a goof.  And Camilla Parker Bowles thought he was the shit, because she didn't have any other options. 
[01:09:30]  No, of course not.  So obviously you're going to be attracted to the girl who thinks you're awesome if you're  the Prince.  You're used to people like, you know, looking up to you.  Yeah, and you know, Die was probably a fucking kind of anorexic, you know, who knows?  Just fucking other guys on the side.  Yeah, that doesn't do good things to you.  We explained gout, right?  Because this guy has gout, this guy wants to explain gout.  We explained it.  What's it do to you?  Can't explain gout.  Fuck it. 
[01:10:00]  Let's go to North Carolina.  Phil, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hi, buddy.  Good morning.  Yeah, gout is...  Your body produces too much uratic acid, and it doesn't...  It can't get rid of it the way normal people do, so it produces these crystals that go  to the extremities, like every joint.  It can go in your toes.  Usually it's your big toe, but you just wake up, and there it is.  And let me tell you, it's a motherfucker.  Yeah, that doesn't sound fun. 
[01:10:30]  I don't want gout.  No.  And it'll go to your fingers, your elbows, your knees.  But is it kind of...  It's a virus?  No, no, no.  It's just your body produces...  Everybody has uratic acid, but...  But why are some bodies producing that, and others aren't?  I think it's like an infection.  To that extent, yeah.  And they all produce it.  It's just some people can't get rid of it and filter it as good as others.  Oh, all right, man.  Thank you.  This guy says... 
[01:11:00]  Don, go ahead real fast.  Oh, yeah.  I just wanted to let you know, boys, that in order to get rid of gout, there's this pill.  It's called colchicine.  It's from the 1800s.  Wow.  You basically take a pill every hour or so until you either shit yourself or you're on  the toilet puking, and then the next day, your gout's gone.  That's how bad it is to get rid of this shit.  Oh, wow.  Is Sal mad?  I bet he is.  Oh, it's awful.  Sal!  Get Sal in here.  So you shit your pants to try to take care of the gout?  Pretty much, yeah. 
[01:11:30]  You take a pill until you're on the toilet every 30 minutes.  Right.  You shit water out your ass, Sal.  Sal, you mad?  You mad, bro?  About the prep sheet thing?  No, I'm not mad.  I just, you know...  Disappointed in yourself?  I'm disappointed in myself.  Why are you disappointed in yourself?  Look at Jimmy reworking the entire prep sheet for the big interview with Martin Freeman from  The Hobbit.  Because you never know what a guy is going to be like.  Like, sometimes these guys come in and we just, the prep sheet doesn't matter, we just  start talking.  Other times, like, Jeffrey Rush, I think would have been a better interview.  I wish we had just come back from break then, and I wish I had been more prepared for that. 
[01:12:00]  Like, I was...  I thought it was good.  It was okay, but I would have loved to have had a little bit more on him.  But again, I should have done some more research on him.  Like, I look back on some of those, and I'm like, ah, there was more to get out of that  guy.  So, why would you put on the prep sheet for Martin Freeman, who obviously is The Hobbit  in The Hobbit, uh, on The Hobbit, it's due to be completed literally two days before  the premiere, hopefully.  And that's a quote from Peter Jackson.  I just figured it'd be an interesting concept that, like, you know, something of such magnitude  like gets done two days before they actually, like, air, you know, show it to everybody. 
[01:12:30]  Well, you were wrong.  It's not interesting at all.  I would assume most movies, they come right down to the wire.  Shit.  And why are you talking about the frame rate here?  Uh, it was a new technology that I thought that needed to be noted, you know?  Jimmy?  Well, you know, I understand why he'd mention it, but I would have put it probably, I wouldn't  have put a four-line explanation for it, I think.  I think it's a bit much, a bit, it's, it's a bit long-winded and unnecessarily space-consuming. 
[01:13:00]  That's mine.  Uh, Travis did a better one.  Okay.  A better what?  Prep sheet?  Mm-hmm.  Reportedly a vegetarian.  Yeah, I mean, that's something, it's, I have the same, I get the same thing, I just put  on, I just put on and Googled him.  Yeah, exactly.  Did you, thank you.  Did you Google the guy?  Yeah, of course.  Travis just did what I've been, did you Google the guy?  Travis just wrote down things that I've been writing down for the last ten minutes, which  is, uh, he's a vegetarian, he's a fan of Motown music and interviewed Smokey Robinson, 
[01:13:30]  um, youngest of five children, his father passed, like, again, it may not ever come to that.  Right.  But I like the idea that he interviewed Smokey Robinson, because I'd be more interested  in interviewing one of your guys you look up to, or a hero.  Of course, this is go-to stuff that we might not even ask the guy.  We may not need it, but I find that stuff...  But some of that stuff, you end up getting 10, 15 minutes out of.  Sometimes it sparks a good conversation.  And you go in a direction that you weren't expected to go in.  Here's the thing that I think Sal could improve on, is I like to, uh...  Everything?  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, shit.  I'm just trying to stick to one thing right now, you know?  Uh, you know, Google News is the guy.  Like, read a couple interviews that he's done, because he's promoting something right now,  so he's giving a lot of interviews.  One thing interesting that I learned that I put on my prep sheet was that Peter Jackson,  he almost, uh, Martin Freeman almost turned down the role of Bilbo Baggins because of his  commitment to Sherlock.  Sherlock, Peter Jackson was such a fan of him on The Office that he told Warner Brothers  that, that shooting would revolve around Martin's schedule. 
[01:14:30]  See?  I thought that was very interesting.  That's, that really is, and I, I don't know if I would have gotten to that, but I was going  to ask him, uh, how he got the role, but that's a great, uh, a great point.  How do you get to the point in your career where you're, you're sitting there going,  I can't do The Hobbit.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucked up.  Apparently he's...  That's what I would ask him.  He plays Watson on Sherlock, and apparently he's very good.  Yeah, I've heard he's great.  He's not a, he's not a fan of being a celebrity, like, that's just not his thing.  I put that on my prep sheet.  I just read it.  Oh.  But that's the type of stuff that helps because, uh, you know, like, again, are you a vegetarian 
[01:15:00]  or why are you a vegetarian?  It's not, a lot of times, I just don't like meat.  Okay, that was a nothing question.  But it could go into some other...  Deep thing.  ...meaning, meaning that kind of stuff helps a lot.  Like he was fucked by a horse or something, you know, and now he hates fucking meat.  You don't, yeah, or something, something.  Stay alive, man.  Something.  What?  I was happy I watched Leota's soap stuff because he was happy to, like, that was something  he wanted to talk about, and it wound up being interesting hearing him discuss that.  Like, this weird little shit is usually what gets them going more. 
[01:15:30]  And that was a great little angle, I thought, you know?  But it could be nothing.  Of course.  I don't say that the interview, it has to be that, but a lot of times that helps, and  I've been interviewed enough where I know that when people are just picking little select  things, so you're in Spider-Man, ugh, it just becomes this fucking...  Right.  You want to smash the person for knowing nothing about you.  All right, let's go to Derek in Louisiana because he's saying he's had gout for 20 years.  Last two callers, guess what?  We're full of shit.  Derek, go ahead. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, what's up, Bobo?  Hey, man.  Last time from Food Street.  Yeah, your phone sucks.  I had a great setup for the phone call, too, and everything.  Yeah, I mean...  All right.  Probably.  Screener could have...  Huh?  Terrible phone on the other end.  Who's screening?  I guess the intern.  Iraq, who's screening today?  That would be Sal right now.  Sal was just in here.  Of course.  But Sal, in fairness to Sal, he was just in here. 
[01:16:30]  What?  Oh, hey, Sal.  Can you hear me?  Poor Sal.  Sal, do you feel...  Sal, do you feel like you have to do everything for the show?  I'm sorry.  What happened?  I'm just saying, do you feel like you have to do everything for the show?  I'm actually sticking up for you a little bit.  You're doing the prep sheet.  You're fucking...  Screening the calls.  Screening the calls.  Getting coffee.  I'm not sure what happened because I was walking from the studio into here.  What happened?  He's all shook.  He's shook.  No, the phone was shitty.  And I think Jimmy said maybe the phone screen...  No, Sam said that.  Oh, Sam, sorry. 
[01:17:00]  You should know that maybe we shouldn't go to that call because his phone sucks.  Oh, okay.  So then I felt like I should be on your side.  We didn't know you.  You're getting blamed for a lot of stuff.  But then I'm thinking, man, you must feel like you're doing everything around here.  Is that true?  No, I don't feel like I'm doing everything around here.  I don't know.  What?  I don't know.  What, Sam?  I don't always feel like Sal's giving us everything that's on his mind.  Oh, of course not. 
[01:17:30]  I'm sure he's not.  I think if he's frustrated, it's okay.  He should be able to...  I give him opportunities.  ...to vent that.  He doesn't take the...  He does the E-Roc thing where he doesn't take the opportunities to vent his frustration.  Sure.  Sal, comment.  Yeah, I guess...  I mean, I'm trying to be very careful about how I word things, you know?  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah, just say...  I mean, I get...  You understand what show you work for?  Just speak your mind.  Yeah, what do you want to say, Sam?  I mean, uh...  No, um...  Sal.  Sal, sorry.  He's coming in. 
[01:18:00]  Can you just do it from that mic?  No one out there knows what mic he's on.  Sal, he likes to be here.  Speak your mind.  What's up?  No, nothing.  I do just the prep sheets.  I really just don't want to disappoint because I know how important an interview is, you know?  I like the whole, like, vegetarian thing.  But you're smarter than this.  This is stupid.  I know.  I'm with Jimmy on this.  Your prep sheet stinks.  I'm trying to be so careful with it.  I just don't want to put...  Reportedly, he's a vegetarian, and then I hear Jimmy go,  Who the fuck cares if he's a vegetarian?  Possibly.  I can just hear it.  I just hear it in my mind, and I'm like, fuck, that seems so, like... 
[01:18:30]  I understand.  You're kind of damned if you do.  You're damned if you don't.  I understand, and I send out mixed signals.  But with something...  I guess we're just looking for just things that are not as easy to spot, like one layer below.  Not necessarily, you know, was he molested, but, like, just one layer below.  A new angle.  Yeah, just something a little bit different that will make the guy want to...  You know, I mean, we already know the office and things like that.  And, you know, most of this we'll be probably talking about the movie because it's a fucking... 
[01:19:00]  It's a huge film.  And this is a quick interview, so...  Yeah, we have him for 15, 20 minutes.  It's not like it's a three-hour sit-down.  And I sent the email out yesterday, so, like, if anyone, you know, has any sort of input,  I'm gladly...  I will gladly revise it.  I have no problem with doing that and giving you something...  I'm not on the email list.  That could be part of the problem.  Well, you don't check your email.  Well, it's not set up on my phone yet.  Oh.  Oh, so you've got to be sent it to your Gmail?  No, no, no.  I don't want you...  I don't want any work shit on my Gmail.  All right, so it's not that you're not on the email. 
[01:19:30]  It's that you refuse to accept the email.  No, I've got a work email, but it's just not set up right now.  So when was the last time you checked out your work email?  Six months ago.  Okay, so that would be the issue.  I've never seen one.  No, when I broke my phone, so I had the S2.  Yeah, about three months.  Three months.  Three months ago was the last time I saw email.  But we sent Jim's to his Gmail.  But I told Gary, like, what am I waiting for?  Last time I heard...  Some kind of password or something?  Yeah, you needed a new pin, I think.  From who?  IT, I think.  So when am I getting the new pin?  I don't know. 
[01:20:00]  I'm not the point man.  But I'm sure that Travis or I or Eric or anybody could get your pin.  All right.  Well, maybe we should do that.  Maybe I should be in the loop.  Dude, I get our emails.  They're a waste.  Most of them, like, I love Jose, but I get a lot of stuff about liquid metal and stuff  that I don't care about.  And if you're on the whole work team, who wants to see everything everybody's talking about?  I don't care.  Why is he sending emails to everybody?  I'm not saying...  I mean, it's only in that little group who work, you know, because Jose is the guy who  runs the two channels.  Right.  So I get stuff from both of those channels. 
[01:20:30]  But I just don't care about anything that's going on with anyone but me and my show.  Which is probably self-centered, but...  Probably.  Yeah, I don't care.  It's not my concern.  No.  Of course not.  I have enough trouble keeping my own life in line, my own business.  Speaking of the Yankees, good segue, right?  Excellent.  Terrible.  You're a big fan of A-Rod, aren't you?  Now he's out another four to six months.  They're paying this guy a ridiculous amount of money.  And now second hip op, sideline star till mid-season. 
[01:21:00]  I think that's great for the Yankees.  This guy stinks.  But he's good early.  He's on the other side of his career.  No, that's his best months.  Fucking April, May, and June.  That's when A-Rod really shines.  Yeah.  You hope he gets hurt in fucking October.  I'd love him to break his back in fucking September 30th.  I would assume the Yankees want to get rid of him.  I know he has a no-trade clause and all that, but they probably could get a sweet deal for  him out there.  But now that he's getting an operation, it's going to be tough for another team to want  to take this guy. 
[01:21:30]  See, this is where...  So you Yankee fans are stuck with this guy.  Stuck with this asshole.  And I understand that free agency, these guys should have the right to decide their own  destiny.  But these no-trade clause...  If you're not performing, why should the team have to be stuck with you if you're not  performing?  And I don't mean because of injuries, but he just...  He doesn't perform.  Right.  How come he doesn't have to give any money back because he sucks?  Right.  Yeah, it never works out that way.  Never.  So that's a big story in sports. 
[01:22:00]  It makes me very happy.  Yeah, me too, actually.  Really?  Yeah, I hate him.  Don't you want to be a Yankees fan again?  Jeter, as much as Jeter annoyed me, I think he's a great player.  He's the greatest shortstop they've ever had.  He's one of the best in history.  He's getting fat?  He puts some weight on him because he's got an injury.  But whatever he does now, I don't even care.  It's good for him.  He's got a little belly on him.  He earns it.  And of course, they had to point that out.  Yeah.  But again, all they do is point out all the hot chicks you fuck.  Once in a while, you've got to take one and...  Let me see.  Wow, he looks definitely out of shape. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, he's a little out of shape, but...  For an older guy, he's got to keep that shit together if he wants to keep playing.  Yeah.  His hair's all short.  He looks old there, doesn't he?  Yeah.  But you can now see Jeter as a 50-year-old guy.  Like, that's what he'll look like when he's 50 and he's coaching or whatever it is he's doing.  I don't think he's going to coach.  He'll, uh...  Derek Eater.  That's funny.  I didn't see it.  Oh, yeah.  That's hilarious.  Derek Eater.  That's funny.  That was the back cover of the post, I guess.  And then it says the sub-thing is rehabbing Jeter takes fork in the road to recovery. 
[01:23:00]  They really are getting a little...  They're very cheeky.  Yeah, but he can't fucking burn calories right now as much, right?  Well, he knows that, so he should probably not eat as many.  So he'll be in great shape by April, I'm sure.  Yeah, these guys are good at whipping their body back to where it needs to be.  I find myself every morning...  I look at myself in the mirror.  It's the first thing I do when I get out of bed.  And I'm nude and it's a full-length mirror.  And I realize with my body and the working out... 
[01:23:30]  You look at yourself nude in a full-length mirror?  That's on my way to the bathroom.  I have a full-length great mirror in my...  And you sleep naked, right?  Of course.  I need some PJ.  No, no, I hate it.  Pajama pants, no underwear, no socks, no shirt.  No, I only want...  I could never sleep like that.  Why?  It's just...  I'm fucking 44.  I can't have anything on my dick and balls when I'm sleeping.  Comfortable pajama pants?  For what?  Like, I can't...  Just...  I don't know.  Extra clothes.  There's just no reason to wear clothes in bed.  Do you don't get cold? 
[01:24:00]  Well, I have a comforter.  I have no upper sheet because it got ripped, so I just have my fucking lower sheet and  my comforter, and I'm fine.  I sleep with my window open, and I'm okay.  Yeah, so do I.  That's New York living for you.  Yeah.  So anyway, you see your body in a full-length mirror, nude.  Yeah.  And I'm...  I'm not...  I'm beyond now humiliation.  Like, I'm not humiliated by what I see.  I'm embarrassed.  So it's nice that I'm just...  I'm down to embarrassment now from humiliation. 
[01:24:30]  I would like to get down to decent where I'm comfortable.  Yeah.  But I'm still...  And I've lost weight, but I'm still...  You look good, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I look better.  But there's a lot of still...  It's hard.  Remember when Morgan Spurlock talked about getting rid of all the fat cells that just  become fat, immediately blow you back up?  It's really hard to get rid of this shit.  It's almost impossible.  And I don't want to do lipo.  I want to work out for a year before I do lipo, and then whatever I can't get rid of after  a year is just never going to go. 
[01:25:00]  But it's hard to get rid of this last X amount.  That's what everybody says, but...  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling, but I want to get rid of it.  Because I did an hour and five minutes on the treadmill yesterday.  Looks like you punish yourself.  I do.  I deserve to.  But look at yourself naked in the mirror every day.  You know what's there, so just avoid it.  Nah, I deserve to be punished.  Avoid it, but work out.  I've eaten very well.  Except the week after Thanksgiving, I had a giant piece of fucking peanut butter pie.  It's like, if you're going to eat a piece of shit, make it good.  And it was fucking good.  Peanut butter pie.  It was fucking good, man. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  How good?  Worth it.  Even after that, I wanted to fucking put my fingers down my throat like a fucking...  Like a girl.  Like a girl.  I was like, you know what?  That was worth it.  That was worth hating yourself over.  Right.  That was delicious.  Do you still grab shit and yell at yourself?  I don't yell anymore, but I still grab shit.  Or I'll tighten up my stomach and I can feel the muscle under it.  But then I just see all the fucking gelatinous nonsense on it.  And I'm like, you got a long way to go, stupid.  Many times during this radio show, Jimmy will grab his belly and get mad at it. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I've never seen that before.  But I'm happy with the improvements.  Like, I'm not delusional.  You're good.  I've seen you work out in the gym.  You're an animal.  I just...  Jimmy fucking takes it very seriously.  I've treated myself for too long.  That's all it is.  Like, you know, after a while, you just got to go shut up and fucking finally do something,  you lump.  Is that the way you motivate yourself?  The only way it works is if you get mad at yourself?  Because I should.  Yeah.  I mean, it's the only thing that works is to say, just do it, you fucking asshole.  Like, enough already. 
[01:26:30]  Like, yesterday I didn't want...  I was...  I had got...  I didn't sleep at all Sunday night.  I got like an hour of sleep.  So yesterday I couldn't go to the gym.  I tried to nap, but the coffee here kept me up.  So at like 6 o'clock last night, I was like, I have to leave to go do a set.  Just go downstairs, you cunt.  And I made myself fucking go downstairs for an hour and do something.  Because you called yourself a cunt.  Because that's the only way you respond.  Stop baby-boying myself enough already.  Cell phone guy was there yesterday.  Where?  Oh, that piece of shit.  I wasn't in the...  Me and Ope go to the same one, and I also have one in my building. 
[01:27:00]  And he pointed out this creep in our locker.  I fucking hate him.  He looks like...  That I've seen a million times and thought nothing of it.  He's always on his phone, and he's always just hanging out.  I think he's taking pictures.  He looks like...  And Jimmy goes, he's a creep.  He looks like Alan Arkin.  And there's some guys that are in my little locker area that I say hi to every time I see them.  Like, I even made a little conversation with one guy.  Because there's Patrick Bateman from fucking American Psycho is in my area.  And he opened his...  These lockers always open when he's there.  And it's the neatest.  Oh, really?  But he has an extra shelf in there, and he has all these suit shirts hanging. 
[01:27:30]  You know, it's like a home away from home for him.  Is he the guy that steams his suit when he's done?  I didn't notice.  We got guys that steam their suits.  Like in the steam room, or...?  No, they got steamers and stuff.  Do they really?  They have portable steamers.  Yes.  I didn't notice that.  They have an area to hang your coat, but I always have my camera in my pocket, so I put mine in my locker.  I don't understand guys that take care of their clothes to that extent.  I will never be that guy.  I get it.  It's OCD, but it's also...  I'll pull out an iron every once in a while. 
[01:28:00]  Iron I can't even do anymore, because I have no room for an ironing board in my apartment.  It's just a waste.  So I have one behind my fucking washer-dryer, but I pulled it out, and it was coated with dust.  I'm like, I just have to re-dry my shirt.  I'll just wet the shirt in the sink and throw it in the dryer for 15 minutes, and that will knock some of the wrinkles out.  But that guy we're talking about looks like Alan Arkin, and he's always in the fucking area.  Always in the locker room, no matter when you go to this gym.  And his locker's a mess of pigsty.  Really?  And I just hate him, because I always catch him trying to peek. 
[01:28:30]  He peeks?  How old is he?  Probably in his 60s or late 50s.  I fucking hate him.  Is he just like a gay guy who hangs out?  I think he is, but I always think nasty gay remarks when I'm with him.  And I don't think that about gay guys.  I hate him because he's a fucking peeker.  I think, look at this faggot looking at me.  But if he was just a gay guy prancing around, hi, it would never occur to me to think that way.  Just give him a little peek.  Maybe he'll go away.  Nah, it annoys me.  Is this what you're trying to see? 
[01:29:00]  How great would that be?  I want to just helicopter it in his face.  Here, look.  Snap a shot.  Fuck.  And then he's just looking at you like, I'm talking to my wife.  What's your problem?  But there's another guy who's in our area all the time, and he's a lonely or older guy, and he talks to everybody.  You show him, right?  Because you feel bad for him.  But I don't get that creep energy from him.  He's just a babbling guy who wants to chat.  So him I'll say hi to because I know he's just a babbling, lonely guy.  But he's not trying to be a fucking look-at-my-dick creep. 
[01:29:30]  You know what I mean?  I have no, he's like, ah, you know, Sandy, it's crazy.  Is he naked when he talks to you?  No.  Old guys in general have no problem being naked and just talking to each other.  I find that to be extremely strange.  If he's naked, he's in the process of getting dressed.  Because I don't think it's a creep thing.  I think you get to a point where you're just an old guy, and you don't give a fuck if you're naked.  It has nothing to do with sexuality whatsoever.  You've lost all sense of shame or care.  Maybe, yeah.  I've seen two old guys many times just standing there completely naked, talking to each other like it's nothing. 
[01:30:00]  Is the creep naked when he's on the phone taking pictures?  No.  He's never naked.  No, but he always seems to have business on his phone.  Yeah, he always just seems to be holding his phone in a way, and believe me, he doesn't have any pictures of me.  Because I'll actually, with my towel on, like in a locker, I'm not paranoid, I'll drop my towel for a half second and pull my underwear on.  Tell us more.  And, yeah, I mean.  Where is this locker room?  Well, you know, and I'll sometimes turn and prop my right foot up and just let my dick and balls hangle.  Hangle. 
[01:30:30]  Hangle.  Dangle.  But, no, I'm not that fucking freaked out, but I don't walk around the locker room.  I didn't even notice that guy until you pointed him out, and now it's pretty obvious.  I'll show you the other guy.  Why would you want to hang out in a locker room that long?  We do have a nice locker room.  It's not an office, dude.  It's just fucking just get in and get out.  But he likes hanging around.  There's some flat screens.  You can watch some shit.  You think he's got Opie dick shots because you didn't notice him at first?  I don't walk around naked.  You don't even just take it out for a second and let everybody take a look?  I'm dying to just walk naked and chat with Opie until he gets uncomfortable.  You got to.  But I just can't.  I'm weird like that. 
[01:31:00]  I can do it, but I can't.  Yeah, it's not a big deal.  How funny would it be?  I would laugh.  How long would it be?  I would laugh later.  It would be funny.  But I don't like to do that because there's just too much weird shit that happens in a locker.  But there's one guy, and I'll show him to you when I see him with it.  He looks like a judge to me.  He's an old, fat, bald guy who's always naked talking to the black guy that works in the locker room.  And there's one black guy.  He looks like Isaac Hayes.  He's bald. 
[01:31:30]  He's a big dude, and I don't think he likes me very much.  He's hard to figure out.  Yeah, I don't care.  But he, yeah, fuck him.  He kind of tends the locker room.  You know, he keeps it neat.  But he's always talking to this old guy, and the old guy is always naked.  And I mean, I'll go in.  After the workout, a lot of times I'll sit in the steam room and just stretch for five minutes with my towel on.  And then I'll shower.  I have like a little routine.  And I come out ten minutes later, and I always see the guy still naked talking. 
[01:32:00]  It's like, what were you doing for ten minutes?  How engrossed are you talking about the Giants that you can't pull your underpants on?  And I don't think it's a sexual thing.  I think it's an exhibitionist thing.  Yes, I do.  With him, you think?  Because it's too long.  It's not, it doesn't reek of a guy who's just comfortable naked talking to a guy.  There's nothing casual about it.  Nothing casual.  Nothing casual.  Yeah, your intent on being nude.  It's calculated.  It's fucking, it's, I'm, look at the black bull staring at my little white man cock. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, he wants to humiliate me.  Oh, my God.  There's something.  Is that deep?  Yeah, there's something gross about it.  That's so funny, though.  That's where it goes with Norton every time.  Somebody wants to be humiliated.  Well, I'm telling you, I've known, a part of me, yeah, you're right.  It does always go there, but I've also learned enough about people's deviance and craziness  to spot things in people that other people wouldn't see.  I'm not always crazy.  Like, sometimes I'm nuts, but not always.  Sometimes I'll pick things out that are, you know, I have good gaydar, as they say.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Gaydar.  Gaydar.  What a dumb fucking term.  Yes.  Gaydar.  Speaking of gaydar, Tom Poppett is coming in, who I thought was gay when I first met him,  but he's not.  Really?  Yeah.  That's many, many, it's almost 20 years ago.  Why did you think that?  Because Tom has a...  So I'm sucking dick?  No, that probably would have made me just like applaud his career enthusiasm.  I sent Tom, by the way, I hope he got it.  I was talking last night because I did that live thing with Tom, which we're doing again 
[01:33:30]  in December, which was a lot of fun.  The old school radio thing live in The Village Underground.  I want to check one of those out.  It was fun.  Come in December.  And I talked about the soundboard thing because he was going to do a bunch of fart sounds.  And so I said, well, let's bring a few different ones, like the boo and the car crash and a  few other ones.  Because I said they really make, you know, there's a real art to it.  Of course.  But we only had like five or six.  But then I sent that time, I said the greatest example of the soundboard is when Lydia was 
[01:34:00]  in and that guy called in with that tragic phone call and Anthony started hitting the  soundboard and you and I were speechless that he was doing this.  And it's one of the hardest...  What was the story again?  Oh my God, dude, it's awful.  It was the guy called in.  We were talking about grief, I think.  Oh, okay.  And the guy's daughter had been killed in a car crash.  So, but Anthony started with the soundboard and I remember the first one he hit and he 
[01:34:30]  was hitting, you know how it goes, you guys just do boom, boom, boom.  And I, we couldn't believe he had just done that.  Yeah, I tapped out on that one.  I tapped out too.  I tapped out immediately.  But I, but it made me laugh so hard that I wept.  It was, it was, and I laughed out loud again listening to it last night.  Like I was literally...  You searched it out?  No, I have it.  I have it saved on my fucking desktop.  Wow, you love it.  It's one of those weird things where no one said anything.  There was not any words spoken.  It was the, the succession of sound clips and he kept adding to them. 
[01:35:00]  And I heard it again last night and I laughed out loud by myself.  Like I couldn't, you know, it's kind of hard to catch us that off guard, I think, just from  being in here all the time.  And it stood, it blew me away that somebody would, it was like...  Well, you're, you're giving away one of our secrets.  There's a lot of times we'll do sick ass shit just to try to get a reaction out of each  other.  So when you sit here day after day, you try to mix it up a little bit.  There's things I absolutely do to try to get a rise out of it.  Dude, the cake stomping was an example of that feeling. 
[01:35:30]  I did that for you.  I did that for you and Ant.  I wasn't even thinking about the radio audience that day.  I just knew you would just be horrified.  And I wanted to see that reaction from you.  Because you kind of almost forget that you're also on the radio.  It's hard to explain.  We're walking on the sidewalk and I see the homeless guy and he presents this fucking  dumb cake that he got out of the garbage.  And I'm like, I gotta see how Jim would handle this. 
[01:36:00]  It was mostly you, not Anthony, on this one.  I'm like, I gotta see how he would handle this if I jumped on in front of him.  It's one of those weird reactions you get where it's, and as a guy sitting with Open  Ant and whoever else we have in, it doesn't make, it's weird to react like an audience  member.  Right.  And I love reacting that way.  Like, I love when something catches me off guard.  Not necessarily just being mean to somebody, but something that makes me go like, oh my  God, and laugh like that.  Like, it's so rare you get to feel that way when you're here all the time because you 
[01:36:30]  see everything or I'll see you guys hitting the buttons, and once in a while something  catches you like that.  You're like, oh my, this is what it's like to enjoy the show from the outside.  Some of my favorite stuff over the years is things I did where I absolutely completed,  sort of forgot I was doing it for Radio Dragons.  Like Steve the Whistler, I did that for you and Ant that day when Ant was so mortified and  embarrassed that he would start hiding behind equipment.  The computer monitors.  I was not thinking about the fans or the audience anymore. 
[01:37:00]  I was like, oh, what else can I do to really just fucking make him as uncomfortable as  possible?  And then after the fact, you realize, oh, fuck, that's right.  A lot of people just heard all that.  Yeah.  Because I love when you're sitting right next to somebody and I know you're way too close  and I'll say things to the guests just to see how you would react.  It's the feeling, like the great part of Patrice laughing at Bobo's dick.  Like, besides the fact that the laugh sounds great.  I'm so glad I filmed that. 
[01:37:30]  I am too.  It's one of my favorite Patrice moments.  And to me, it captures the guy that I knew.  Like that to me is the best video of Patrice O'Neal as like people like, what was Patrice  like?  Watch that video.  And in that video is what I loved about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not being funny or anything in that clip.  It's just, it just shows you the man.  That's the guy.  And what he appreciated as far as humor goes.  But him being caught off guard like that is what was so great about that.  We didn't tell him it was going down.  You never saw him reacting like an audience member.  Right. 
[01:38:00]  He was always the guy being funny or he's always there.  So to see him acting like a fucking guy being caught off guard and oh my God.  It was the, it was the day we showed Patrice and I think a lot of people assume we tell  these guys ahead of time.  We're like, when we have something brand new, we can't wait to show other people.  And it's, it's Bobo when he's, he's naked.  If you talk about sex, he'll get hard immediately.  If you talk about the Mets, he will, he will lose his rod immediately.  And we couldn't wait to show Patrice.  Couldn't wait.  Up and down game.  Up and down game.  And he will, he never knows you're doing it. 
[01:38:30]  He just goes right with whatever you're talking about.  Hey, Tom.  He just goes with what you're talking about.  Yeah.  Tom is coming in.  Before we go to break, I guess, can I ask you, did you get the thing I sent you?  Oh.  What did he send you?  I told you I sent him that clip of Anthony.  I was just, that's how I got it.  Right, right, right, right, right.  Man.  Brutal, right?  Brutal.  And hearing you guys in the background was hilarious because it really, you could tell  it really affected you.  I think at the beginning you're like, it's the first time I've ever been uncomfortable.  Oh yeah. 
[01:39:00]  I said it last week too.  It's very rare to get me uncomfortable.  Oh man.  And it's very rare for me to actually tap out on shit.  But that day was brutal.  Could you believe he did?  No.  But to me, it's like, yeah, it was heartless, but there's the other side of me that goes,  that's the extent, like that's his ability to be funny, is to do something that unconscionable,  but there is a comedic value to it.  There is.  I howled again alone last night listening to that after I sent it to you. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  It was a weird thing because you sent it to me pretty late, so I was in bed just before  I was going to sleep and I was listening to it.  My wife heard it.  Oh, she must have been horrible.  Horrified.  No, it's funny.  And because they're parents too, I know.  Right.  For me and Anthony, we're not.  Yeah.  And it's about a girl.  We have a girl and it's just like, my wife was horrified and I'm kind of giggling and  I'm like, I got to turn this off or she's going to kill me.  It was, but that's...  We might have to replay it now.  Oh my, dude.  How long is it? 
[01:40:00]  The clip I had was five minutes.  It's like five minutes.  Right.  Because we edit, we say hello to Lydia when she comes in.  Yeah.  And then we talk for a minute and then it goes right to this caller.  It's the phone call.  Oh.  I laughed so hard at that because it is heartless and it is sad.  What did the guy do on the phone?  He was kind of cool.  He was fine with it because he knew the radio show he was calling into.  Right.  Yeah.  And he knew that, and Lydia acknowledged, as you could see, it's kind of hard to hear  this stuff for these guys.  Yeah, she put it off on that you guys couldn't handle it.  And that's a big part of it. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  That's a big part of that gallows humor is it's so uncomfortable and painful that you  just have to go for the laugh.  Right.  And that is, because Ann's not a piece of shit.  Ann's a sweet guy.  Right.  But that's what he was doing.  When you told me, when you told me you just had something with sound effects and I got  to hear it, I was like, all right, I wonder what he did.  And he picks that one?  That was the one.  As soon as I hear that, I'm like, oh.  Oh, man.  Because it's the most extreme example of how sound effects can help a comedy piece.  Without any commentary, yeah.  Yeah.  With no commentary. 
[01:41:00]  If it's perfectly timed, it's very effective.  Really funny.  Yeah.  Oh, but brutal.  Brutal.  And then, like, you know he's going to come again, and you're like, please, because they  mentioned, like, the other parts of the story, and I'm thinking, I hope he just moves  on.  I hope he just goes on and does something else, like a chicken sound or something, and no, he  comes back with the car.  But the succession of sounds, and it all tied in, it told a story.  You got it?  Yeah, I have, like, it's an eight-minute movie.  No, no, no.  Mine is not eight minutes.  Mine, see if they can find, maybe E-Rock can find that or something. 
[01:41:30]  It's five minutes.  But it was brutal.  How'd you get your copy?  I forget.  I've had it for a couple years, and it was one of those things where I laugh when I don't  hear it for a while.  It caught me off guard again, like, I knew it was coming, but what's happening is, and  I'm not going to give away what it is, because if you haven't heard it, you'll be, but as  the story is progressing, the sound effect, it was, A, so unexpected, and B, the absolute 
[01:42:00]  worst sound effect he could have played.  And it hit me again, but I couldn't believe it was happening.  We got it?  Rough.  Awesome.  E-Rock's looking for it.  Maybe we'll play it after the break, because we were too vague about it, so people need  to know, so now we've got to play it, I think.  How long ago was the original?  I want to say 2009 or 10.  It was 2009.  Oh, yeah.  And people are asking me about Caroline's on Broadway.  Oh, really?  When were they at?  Who asked you that? 
[01:42:30]  Why?  What's happening there?  Well, it's funny.  All right, I wasn't going to mention it, but April 11th through 14th, I will be there.  Tickets are on sale now at carolines.com, and a couple of quick plugs.  I know, they go on sale really early at Caroline's.  That's great.  January 10th through 12th, I return to Nashville at Zany's, and then 25 and 26, only that weekend,  I'm in San Diego at the American Comedy Club, my favorite, my favorite, my first time in  that market ever.  Oh, you're going to like it.  It's supposed to be good.  I did a spot with Rogan there.  It was great. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  A great club.  So you've got to, the people have to come out, or you're never going to go back.  Well, yeah, when people email me enough and say, come to this city, and I do, and I see  a half a room, I'm like, why would I ever go back?  That's why people, I love people in Houston.  The crowds that came were great.  Yeah.  But there's not enough of them, and I won't go back.  Houston has answered.  I have asked, and Houston has said no.  That's got to be weird for you guys, because then you go to Dallas, and you get a full room.  Sometimes.  Yeah, it is weird.  Last week, time in Dallas was average. 
[01:43:30]  Average, right.  But it's strange.  You guys all have your hot spots.  Why wouldn't you have hot spots everywhere?  I don't know.  Especially when you're on a national platform now, like this.  Yeah.  Where's the last place you worked where you just had mediocre, and I mean size-wise crowds,  like, god damn, I've done this for a long time, and this is what I do?  Yeah, when you see the waitresses putting on their jackets for the second show.  For the early show Saturday.  What do you mean, putting on their jackets?  Well, if you have two shows on a Friday, and like, Friday late show is tough.  Yeah.  If you're marginal in a market, even, like, you could do really well, but that second show 
[01:44:00]  Friday, unless you're killing it, it's going to be a little less, and that means less staff.  So you see, like, the waitresses as you're getting ready for the show, like, this is going  to be a good one, right?  And you see they're just putting their jackets on and getting their keys on.  Oh, they get to go home early.  We had Carlos Mencia last week.  That was fun.  Oh.  So you know they're making less, or when they're sitting in the back just watching the show,  and you know it's your fault.  It's the fucking worst, dude.  It's horrible. 
[01:44:30]  And I don't feel that bad, like, if it's a market, like, in Dallas, last time I was  there, I had a really good Thursday night.  Friday, half full.  Not amazing at all.  Saturday, very, very comfortable.  Yeah.  So I felt a little bad about the Friday, but my history in Dallas has been pretty good.  Yeah.  I've had average weekends, and I've had amazing weekends.  So if I have an off one, I'm okay with it.  Yeah.  But in Houston, every time I go there, it's very small crowds.  Yeah.  I have to just accept the fact that I do not resonate.  You're not drawing in Houston.  But Austin was great. 
[01:45:00]  I did great in Austin.  How weird is that?  Houston, they just do not, there's not a call for the, they don't want to be in the Jim Norton  business in Houston.  What type of person lives in Houston that doesn't live in Dallas or Austin?  It's older, oil people.  It's not, it's not like a real go out.  It's not a hip.  It's not.  It's not as hip as in Austin, obviously.  No, no.  You have to hit the next, like, there's not enough Jim Norton specific people, like, in  Boston there are.  Like, what Louie has done, and what so many guys have done, is they go above and they just 
[01:45:30]  get this whole new gathering of people who aren't fans of their specific show, but are  fans of them as a name, because they're so famous, I'm not even near that, so I can only  get, like, Opie and Anthony people, or people who saw me on Lucky Louie.  I'm too specific.  I'm not big enough to get a broader range.  How are you in Minnesota?  I do, that's a great comedy city, a great comedy city.  I do great there.  It's really good.  And you do great in Minnesota.  We were never on Terrestrial there.  I saw that at the Pantages the first time I was there.  Because I asked Kenny, the first thing I ask him every Monday, when you're traveling,  I go, how did he do? 
[01:46:00]  I'm really curious.  Sure.  From a radio standpoint, what cities we do very well in.  And I remember him saying Minnesota was great, a lot of O&A fans.  A lot of O&A fans.  And then he'll hit me up with, yeah, not so great.  Like, I think it was Houston.  He goes, yeah, not many O&A fans in Houston.  And a lot of it has to do with how the club works.  Like, if the club is really aggressive and they're really smart, like the DC Improv,  they know when you come in, there's specific places you should market.  You should go, like, radio or TV or whatever that will hit your people. 
[01:46:30]  Then when I come in, it's like a different crowd and they'll go, and it does great.  Other ones, it's just like a manager running the club.  They don't care.  They go to the same one radio station and they don't care.  And they don't really, they're not aggressive about it.  It's gotten a little harder because there's terrestrial radio.  There's not as much, Tom is much more, has a better range of places he can go and be  very funny.  Tom can be very funny on those morning shows.  And I mean doing your act, like, you have an ability. 
[01:47:00]  Your act is a broader range than mine.  I stink on those shows.  And it's not that they don't get me.  I'm just not that good on them because everything I do is going to be a fucking problem.  Right, when they're really sensitive.  And I'm not saying that in a backhanded way.  Tom is a fucking...  Carol in the morning.  I can't do those.  So who's this Jim Norton?  Yeah, but you could...  Tom is a weird case of a guy who can be totally clean, but really fun.  Like, Tom's a really funny act.  And I mean a fucking...  Me and Al and Hady were talking about you.  When, uh...  You kill.  Tom fucking kills. 
[01:47:30]  Middle-aged housewives.  You should see what I can do.  But no, in any crowd, though.  He's just got this...  You got a lot of women?  He's a nice guy, but he's aggressive.  A lot of women fans?  Yeah, a lot of ladies.  We don't have a lot of lady fans there.  Oh, we have four.  I think we have four.  What's amazing...  We change our look every once in a while, so we get tricked and we have new fans.  But it's the same fucking broad stuff.  No, what's amazing about this show, though, is I do a lot of corporate dates, you know,  like Microsoft or someone will bring me in.  And...  You hear that, Jim? 
[01:48:00]  A lot of...  Does that bother you?  No, because I could never do them.  You don't do the corporate.  When I'm at these corporate things, so many people come up and say they listen to O&A.  Nice.  And these are like, you know, not what I...  In my head, I would picture...  Like, these are guys in suits and coming in and they're like running stuff and there's  like the manager or whatever and they're like, oh, I'm a big fan when you go on the O&A.  And it's like, wow, the reach of...  I mean, and it's not just like a one-off.  It's consistent.  It's because fans of this show have learned to be quiet and ashamed.  We're like... 
[01:48:30]  This show inspires people.  They're painting little fish on cave walls.  We're Christianity fucking in 30 A.D.  You know, people have to kind of whisper,  oh, Van Anthony fell.  Oh, Van Anthony fell.  They do take me on the side like, I'm a big fan of O&A, but don't tell anybody, please.  Don't tell my boss.  Don't fire me.  Keep it under your hat.  All right, Tom Poppins here.  Yeah.  So we'll take a break and we'll continue.  Oh, wait.  I'm going to...  Oh, wait.  There's something on this paper, too.  What is that, buddy?  It says I'm going to be in Phoenix, Arizona next weekend. 
[01:49:00]  So will I.  Where are you going to be?  Stand up live.  I'm not doing...  I'm doing a corporate gig, a private party.  Oh, nice.  First time...  Maybe we can have like dinner or something.  No, I'm busy.  No, I mean, because we're going to be in the same town.  The 15th?  No, the 13th.  Yeah, 13th through the 15th.  I will be in Phoenix.  Oh, we should do something.  I would like that.  I love Phoenix.  I do, too.  Do you like laser tag?  I love laser tag.  We should play laser tag.  I have apnea.  I'm lucky if I get an hour a night.  I'm lucky if I get to the gig.  I know. 
[01:49:30]  Laser tag.  Have you ever been to that club, Stand Up Live?  No, I've done...  It's supposed to be nice.  What did I do in Phoenix last time?  Tempe Improv?  Oh, yeah.  One of the best rooms in the country.  How did that...  Here's why I closed.  Because I did there a great job.  I had great shows.  Utah is a great club in Utah.  Yeah.  In fucking Salt Lake City, they got an amazing comedy club.  Yeah.  You never know some places, man.  You show up for the first time and it's fucking packed.  Yeah.  And then other times, it's like, this is my ninth time through and nobody gives a fuck.  E-Rock found the phone call. 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  I think it set it up.  So we could just play it into break.  How long is it?  It's about five minutes.  Okay.  So what's the setup, Jimmy, once again?  It was...  Why are we playing this out of nowhere?  Lydia had...  Tom and I had...  Tom did this live radio show at the Village Underground.  Like an old school thing.  Classic radio, like scripted sketches.  Foley work?  Yeah.  A little bit of that type of stuff like that.  Can I do the horse sound next time?  Yeah.  We're going to do a Christmas extra.  Clops.  And he came into the room on his horse. 
[01:50:30]  Clop, clop, clop, clop, clop.  Can I just do that?  That's all I want to do.  Yes.  Or thunder.  Or I could do fire, I think.  Sleigh bells.  Fire.  Yeah.  So Jimmy came in and he played the machine.  Right.  Oh, it's getting hot.  Yeah, it's warm.  Ooh, it's really...  Oh.  And fire.  Fire.  Who put on that much wood?  So Tom said he wanted his sound machine.  He was doing some fart sound effects just to kind of make fun of that.  And I had...  I said, let's bring a couple extra ones. 
[01:51:00]  And I suggested the car crash and Homer and a couple of...  But, you know, we talked about that.  So last night.  I sent a great example of that last night of sound effects.  Like the most jarring example I can think of is this one we're going to play where Lydia,  the psychologist who calls in, the big-titted, sexy psychologist, was here.  And we were talking to her, and I think we talked about grief, although it's probably  cut out of this.  And then it goes into the phone call where a guy called in who had dealt with grief.  Oh, boy.  And then this is all Anthony, and it was just jarring. 
[01:51:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Who's this?  This is Joe from Long Island.  Hey, Joe.  Hello, Joe.  I'm okay.  I was hearing your discussion, and I'm divorced seven years.  I had two children.  My 17-year-old daughter, five years ago, died in a car accident because my ex-wife told her  that I would not put her through college. 
[01:52:00]  And my 19-year-old son doesn't talk to me today.  What do I do?  Well, a little detail.  So the 17-year-old daughter killed herself in a car?  No, no, no.  She didn't kill herself.  She was on the way home from a job.  Right.  Because she took a job because my ex-wife told her that I wouldn't pay for her to go to  college.  And on the way home from that job one night, she was killed in a car accident.  Oh, man.  But you're saying that it was because you were not sending her to college.  I mean, that's not why. 
[01:52:30]  No, it's because if he would have paid for college, she wouldn't have had the job, which  means she wouldn't have been on the road and she wouldn't have died in a car accident.  So it's a bit of a stretch.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But also, the car that was given to her was one of those old Saturns that folded up like  paper.  And my brother-in-law gave it to her.  There's plenty of guilt to go around, huh?  Oh, big time.  Is that why your son's not talking to you?  No, my son doesn't talk to me because of whatever my ex-wife has told her. 
[01:53:00]  And she made our divorce a living hell that lasted four years because she was only interested  in property and money.  First off, let me let you off the hook.  Your daughter's death is not your fault.  I know that it's not my fault.  I grieve my daughter's death, but I still, it hurts terribly that my ex-wife would actually  say this to a child.  It's hard to believe that someone you once loved could hate you so much, to be so cruel. 
[01:53:30]  Well, like I said, it was all about having a boyfriend and money and getting everything  that she wanted, which includes this.  It sounds like this is still so fresh for you like it happened yesterday.  Um, I'm divorced since 2002 and my daughter died, um, two months after our divorce. 
[01:54:00]  You can't bring your daughter back.  There's nothing you can do about that except to let go of the guilt.  Holy shit, for the first time ever, I am so uncomfortable.  Yeah, well, I've, I've let go of the fact that my daughter died, you know, needlessly  and I grieve her.  And I also forgave my ex-wife for what she did, even though she doesn't believe it.  I wrote her a letter telling her that because you know what?  If I carry around this pain and this anger, it only destroys me. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Have you tried to talk to your son?  Um, yeah, he talks to me, uh, let's see, uh, you got money?  Uh, dad, uh, medical and dental benefits.  But other than, uh, you know, asking for money or for medical or dental benefits,  it doesn't go any further than that. 
[01:55:00]  It's hard to hear this stuff.  I think you hear that, that the boys are having a little trouble hearing this stuff, sir.  Yeah, I, I know that they are, but that's okay.  I understand, uh, their motives.  You have to try and reach out to your son in any way.  Hello, she's dead!  Yeah, I try to reach out to him, but, uh, he's, uh, very, uh, non-cooperative. 
[01:55:30]  Keep trying.  You can't control how he reacts.  All you can do is control your attempts.  True.  That way, if, God forbid, you died tomorrow, you knew you did everything in your power  to make that relationship better.  Are you kidding me?  My son tells me he wouldn't come to my funeral.  You can act like a man!  What's the matter with you?  He will have to live with that grief and lack of closure with you, sir,  but you don't have to live with that. 
[01:56:00]  You do everything you can to make things right  and know that you've done everything you can.  No one can do more than that.  Okay.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Good luck, sir.  Sounds like a tough situation.  Thank you very, very much, and have a good day, boys.  Oh, take it easy.  Sorry about your loss.  Got it, man.  You're gonna be okay! 
[01:56:30]  I am, uh...  I've never actually been grateful to not have a sound clip machine.  So mean.  Wow.  Oh, God.  I can't do anything.  Funny, but man.  He doesn't like real moments.  What?  Is that what it is?  I get too uncomfortable, I have to do stuff?  Get up if you want to.  It's Grim in the Morning with Greg and Jim. 
[01:57:00]  Tom Papa has joined the program.  Ring, go the bells, ring, ding, ding, dong.

[01:57:30]  terribly in 2003 and 14 off the air.  Do you want it with or without the music?  There's two versions, with or without the music.  I never heard it with the music.  The original, by the way, we can't take credit for this.  We just found it.  Just found it, like every other radio guy.  It's one of those things that a lot of guys play. 
[01:58:00]  So here it is for Tom Poppo.  Da-na-na-na-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I'm wicked, wicked king, making flamethrowers.  I'm a paper hat.  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Ding-pies are done, ding-pies are done.  Ding-pies are done, ding-pies are done.  I gotta run, I gotta run, I gotta run, I gotta run.  Don't pop for fries and hot fat it really hurts bad and so does skin grab. 
[01:58:30]  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Where is the bell?  Wait for the bell, can't hear the bell?  Because it reminds me of this show.  Ding-fi-da-dun, ding-fi-da-dun, ding-fi-da-dun, ding-fi-da-dun.  I'm Wicker Wicker King, making framework whoppers.  I wear paper hats.  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Ding-fi-da-dun, ding-fi-da-dun, ding-fi-da-dun.  Ding-fi-da-dun. 
[01:59:00]  that just reminded me of  weird things would remind me of the show  when we were off and I fucking would be out of my  mind depressed because this great  gig I had found was just taken away  it was awful  you want to hear a brand new Christmas song?  yeah  we all know DMX right?  this shit was trending yesterday  DMX decided he needed to sing  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer  you know Dasher and Dancer  and Prancer and Vixen  Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blissin 
[01:59:30]  what do you recall?  the most famous reindeer of all  come on!  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer  had a very shiny nose  and if you ever saw him  you would even say it close  come on! come on!  all of the other reindeer  used to laugh and call them names  they never let poor Rudolph  join in any reindeer games  then one foggy Christmas Eve  Santa came to say  come on!  Rudolph with your nose so bright 
[02:00:00]  won't you ride my sleigh tonight?  then all the reindeers loved him  and he shouted out weekly  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer  you went out of history  forever  you went out of history  forever  you went out of history  what?  what's impressive is that he knows all the words  yeah very good  that's just scary though  I mean Christmas songs are supposed to make you feel like  warm inside  yeah if your kids are listening to that  you just start crying 
[02:00:30]  holy fuck  I want to run away  I want to run away from the scary man  I only know the first like three words of every Christmas carol  really?  yeah I don't know  you know the first verse  and then the rest  I like  it's the most wonderful time of the year  and then what's next?  something about ghost stories 
[02:01:00]  I know that's it  it's the most wonderful time of the year  this is my number one by the way  people know that  yeah?  this song?  this is my number one Christmas song  it is a really good one  it stinks who sings this?  Andy Williams  who's no longer with us  it's the most wonderful time of the year  this bugs me  why?  I still don't like it  it's joyous  you know Paul McCartney's is good

[02:04:30]  no never  it never happens  nothing  who the fuck  who the fuck  is he singing these songs for  Maine and  fucking  North Dakota  North Dakota  the rest of the country  we don't get  the white Christmas  it's a North Dakota Christmas  when you're beating your wife  and got a big knife  Bing Crosby  what  Bing Crosby  Bing Crosby  I like that  Bing Crosby  I like the song  where like  it's snowing so much  that she has to stay the night  and you just know  that there's gonna be 
[02:05:00]  some finger popping  but they make it all romantic  and shit  where they're gonna hang out  around a fire  baby it's cold outside  yeah she now has to stay there  you know that  I really should go  you know she's getting it  in the shitter  next to the fire  but they can't say it in song  why is your hand up my dress  baby it's cold outside  he's working it in this song  he totally is  but baby it's cold outside  that means I'm fucking horny  and I want some ass 
[02:05:30]  he's got her car keys in his hand  he won't give them back  I love breaking down these old songs  because you know it's all about  you know  trying to get some action  but they romanticize  so he wants to stick it in her ass  and he's trying to think  of how he can sing  after I pulled it out  there was a chestnut  a chestnut  god damn it  I was gonna say a chestnut  on my helmet  and I got eager  baby it's cold outside  he's trying to get her drunk  sounds like Patrice's story  about the rest area  give me my panties back  right 
[02:06:00]  it's cold outside  this is Dean Martin right  yeah  I always hated Dean Martin stuff  I love Dean Martin  he's terrible  he's great  he's not  he's alright  he's kind of boozy  Jimmy  exactly  what's a good Dean Martin song  with a big pizza pie  that's amore  I get it  that fucking song stinks  when the moon hits your eye  like a big pizza pie  yuck

[02:07:00]  Sam Roberts  good for you  lead the cause  it looks like an exhausting show  with all that scene  every week  it really does  fuck  is that what that's about  I've never seen it  I think we were talking about it last week  Broadway musicals  they're just exhausting  to sit through  like the worst  and then they finally talk  for a couple minutes  you're so relieved  thank god  but all it is  is setting up the next song  fuck  when you hear him revving up  it's the worst  right  it's  well 
[02:07:30]  I don't know  it's kind of spicy  what do you mean  have you ever had  spicy food  oh here it comes  the music will start  well I'm not sure  what you mean  dun dun  because I am not coming home  bum bum bum  I thought you know  there's a number  about to begin  I'm really not coming  I'm really not coming  home  thanks  the worst  although we did say  Book of Mormon  amazing  one of the greatest things  I've ever seen 
[02:08:00]  and that's a musical  and it was amazing  but it was brilliant  and funny  but that was original  and different  now there's Elf the musical  there's A Christmas Story  the musical  Shrek the musical  Clockwork Orange the musical  well that's a good one  I just made that up  what happened to just talking  I know  it's just a play  with a couple songs  fine  fuck  you know you're at a bad  Broadway show  when you look down  at that fucking program  and go  oh my god  alright  wait wait  I missed one  fuck  there's seven songs left 
[02:08:30]  the worst  you realize before intermission  it's a complete waste of time  and now you're just  counting down the songs  you know  you know you have  in your future though  are little kids musicals  yeah  at the schools  where every kid  has to sing  and you have to sit  through all of it  all the crap  and you sit through  your kid  and it's great  of course  and then you have to  sit through five hours  of other people's  useless sacks of garbage  other people's loads  basically  you're listening to  five hours of  other people's loads 
[02:09:00]  dressed up for Christmas  loads with ski hats on  oh it's the worst  that's funny  what was it  you brought up something  during the break  and I swear this happened  to me last week as well  but not to your extent  oh  when you get 
[02:09:30]  fucking dog shit  on your shoe  it was the worst  now people are like  what's the big fucking deal  we're not walking  through the woods  this is the worst  I ever had  we rarely see  the woods  in New York City  we're getting dog shit  on our shoes  by just walking  on the sidewalk  it's so violated  but the problem  the problem is  that there's leaves  on the ground  right  so dog people  see that as a free pass  right  I'll just pick a couple  like when I grew up  in suburbia  you saw a pile of leaves  you would roll around  in it 
[02:10:00]  it was joyous  you'd be like  yay leaves  right  now you do that  in the city  I was exhausted  on Sunday  exhausted  I'd flown it  back from a gig  I did this whole thing  all day  it was spent  and my daughter's like  but you promised  a Christmas tree  we were gonna get a tree  yeah you gotta go home  and be a father  so you just suck it up  and you do it  so I've got this tree  on my back  I'm walking through  the village  and I get into my apartment  and I put the tree down 
[02:10:30]  and now we gotta find  the stand  you gotta find the boxes  this is a big deal  oh thank you  so I go  little music for your story  I go marching around  the apartment five times  I get the ladder out  I climb up the ladder  I crawl in this  crawl space thing  I find the boxes  I find the stand  and I start sliding back  on my stomach  and as my feet are dangling  trying to find the ladder  I realize in my hand  I literally  in my hand  is a pile of dog shit  I swear to god 
[02:11:00]  I'm like why  how  oh no  and a little dog shit  goes a long way man  a long way  I just yell  I just start yelling  at my kids  I'm like  get me a paper towel  get me something  I'm holding dog shit  my kids are so pure  they don't even know  what that means  they're like  why is he so mad  does that mean poop  I'm literally holding it  in my hand with a leaf  there's a leaf in my hand  but how'd it get on your hand  because it was on my feet  and as I crawled 
[02:11:30]  through the crawl space  I left it  and now I'm backing up  so not only is it on my hand  it's on my stomach  it's on my jeans  it's all over the fucking apartment  and then I go down  well it's in the crawl space too  right  so now  my wife follows  the trail  of when I came in the apartment  walked around in the rug  in circles  down the stairs  don't you  I always take my shoes off  when I walk in the apartment  that's why  I didn't  I was carrying a tree  I couldn't even think  how mad were you  furious  but you don't want to ruin 
[02:12:00]  the Christmas moment  that's a major  that's a major clean up  so I'm just kind of  I didn't want the kids  to think I'm like  this crabby old man  but dog shit  you can't get the smell  off your hand  I swear Jimmy  I'm still smelling it  dog shit  it's still like  even though it's not on me anymore  I still have the smell  in my nose  dog shit will make you cry  it'll make you cry  when it hits  it really will  especially if you got shoes on  with those deep  you know  treads  you're like  fuck  then what do you do  with your shoes  what do you do with them  get you by a new one  it's a dog with the flu 
[02:12:30]  it's not like one of those  hard dog logs in suburbia  it's a wet nervous  New York dog shit  I find puddles  and just jump up and down  a little bit  hoping that I'll do it  then you find a little stick  just walk around outside  it's such a bummer  but it's these dog owners  in New York City  they will not clean up  after their fucking dogs  the worst  and they will look around  and see if anyone's looking  and they'll walk away  from poo  that's right there  on the sidewalk  they don't give a fuck  they don't care  I literally was holding it  in my hand 
[02:13:00]  dude  one of my fondest  childhood memories  is Mark Rosenberg  and Jason Rosenberg  and I were very good friends  Mark Rosenberg  who's his older brother  we were sitting on the lawn  and Mark leaned his hand  back  to sit like casually  on the grass  and he sunk his hand  into a pile of shit  it was so fresh  I literally could see  the dog around the corner  snickering  like it was  you feel it's still warm  dude  it couldn't have been  a fresher pile  of dog shit  and he was in such 
[02:13:30]  ready to relax mode  it's one of my greatest  memories ever  with his hands  sinking into it  and you really need  help at that moment  but everyone is running  from you like a bomb  just went off  and do that smell  you cannot wash  the smell of dog shit  off your hand  you can't  only time  it's in my carpet  and we like sprayed it  you had to hire a professional  and then last night  I'm sitting there  just reading at the end  of the night  and I still  have you walked by  and actually knelt down  and smelled the carpet  yeah  that's what I would have done 
[02:14:00]  just keep smelling it  call a professional  carpet cleaner  just bite the bullet  you're right  because I stepped  in dog shit recently  and I actually went  and bought new shoes  yesterday  I finally had it  you just chucked them  yeah I kind of needed them  but that was the  thing that put me  over the top  like just get  the shoes asshole  just and all the way  down the stairs  leading into the apartment  how about when they  just smear the dog shit  on the sidewalk  the worst  we're doing observational  humor now  no  I don't like doing  observational humor  no it's more  you know  the hacky kind 
[02:14:30]  I don't like  you're like Andy Rooney  now  no  you ever notice  when you have a clump  of dog shit  in your hand  you don't want to spoil  the Christmas spirit  have you ever stepped  in dog shit  I have  it's really awful  you ever step in shit  I did  but I got this easy gig  but they'll smear it  on the sidewalk  the worst  or your dog  has like  the shit  so it's  it's all watery  yeah the diarrhea dogs  and they just  squirt it all  that's the worst part 
[02:15:00]  about living here  you have a dog  no  people tell me  to get a dog  I'm like no  don't  can't you put a dog  in New York City  now you've got little kids  thank you  you just have one more  thing that you've got  to clean up after  thank you  why can't you fucking  why can't dog owners  when a dog is going  to shit outdoors  just slide a paper under  and make them shit on that  exactly  how hard is that  to slide a piece of paper  instead of putting the bags  over your fucking hands  like your hospice nurses  then you've got to feel  the warm fucking  oh fuck you  dog shit in your hand  how about you just  put a piece of paper down  and say shit on that 
[02:15:30]  or I'm going to kick you  in your stomach  or how about you just  get a dog that  is tiny and shits out  little goat marbles  these things  people walk around  in New York  with Great Danes  right  can you imagine  the logs  that are coming  out of a Great Danes  no  and it's really strange  because a lot of people  in New York City  get dogs  because they're so  fucking lonely  because they don't  want to talk  to anybody else  that's right  exactly  I don't understand  why you would have  a dog in a big  huge city like that  especially with long  I could see a Rottweiler  but then you see 
[02:16:00]  these long fur dogs  that are picking up  cigarette butts  and grit  and their own shit  caked in their hair  and it rains out  and their bellies  are just scooping up  disgusting puddles  and then they jump  on your pillows  I would put a piece  of paper down  and the first time  the dog didn't shit  on it  I would plant my foot  in his fucking stomach  and he'd go  oh I shit on that  when you put it there  I got it  what about the people  it'll piss people off  because we're talking  all  they get the drooly dogs  with the fucking 
[02:16:30]  Turner and Hooch  type shit  the shit that's just  hanging out of their mouths  constantly  why would you buy that dog  and then you go  to their house  and the dog comes over  and slobbers on you  you're like  ugh  and they go  oh you're not a dog person  what dog people  like that  I'm sorry  I didn't accept  his slob  or they lick your face  a dog licking your lips  I don't understand it  we have two cats  people get pissed  in my elevator  because I refuse  to pet their dogs  because everyone  just assumes  oh I love my dog 
[02:17:00]  everyone else loves my dog  but my issue is  I'm very allergic  to most dogs  and that's why  I actually like dogs  fine  but then  they'll start sniffing  and they expect me  to put my hand down  and give them a quick pet  and I don't  and they get mad at me  and I don't feel like  explaining that  if I touch your dog  I could be sneezing  for the next 12 hours  your dog is not a radar  for people's personalities  like if your dog  doesn't like you  or if someone  doesn't pet your dog  it means nothing  see I love  a good dog pet session  in the elevator  live for it 
[02:17:30]  I'll pet the shit  out of a dog  in an elevator  really  yeah  that's my floor  and I get off  I love it  I love when a dog  is all friendly  I'm like ah that's fine  because I get my  fucking animal time  and I wash my hands  because the dog  usually stinks  but it's nice  one of my favorite  things to see  as I walk around  is you got two dogs  and you know how  they have to sniff  each other  and there's always  one dog that's  more aggressive  and bigger  and just like  completely violates  the other dog  in front of you  it makes me laugh 
[02:18:00]  so hard  I would never  walk around  with a tiny dog  that's going to be  violated by everyone  else's big dogs  you know what I mean  and you see the guy  who owns the little dog  he wants to kick the shit  out of the owner  of the big dog  he gets pissed  you're walking around  with the subservient  prison dog  right  well the best is  when the little dog  violates the big one  once in a while  you see that  when the fucking  big dog's all sheepish  and the little one  just wants to put  his dick in  goes to town  yeah it takes balls  to do that  they have no clue  they're so fucking small  that's like literally  one of us 
[02:18:30]  fucking grabbing Kenny  and fucking trying to  throw him  bend him over  and stick our dicks  in his ass  if I lived in  with land  maybe a dog  I would open the door  and you let it go  if I had a backyard  I would have a dog  or a dog run  you see the people  at like the dog park  just sitting there  in the summer  when it's all dusty  and hot  and your dog's  just picking up  every fucking  dog disease possible  ugh  the city is not  a place for a dog  it can't be good  when your dog's  running around  and other dogs  shit  no  no  and then it gets  in their paws 
[02:19:00]  and then it's  your apartment's gotta be  I mean you know  it's so hard to keep  a New York apartment  clean just with humans  in it  because of the air  that blows  and when you open  your window  there's soot  black air  black air  literally  you leave your window  open for one day  I'm amazed we don't  all have black lung  in this city  where does it come from  you just rub your hands  and they're black  just from your counter  from having the window open  this guy said  nothing worse than  trying to clean a turd  off a long haired cat  oh god  oh yeah  then you gotta clip it  yeah 
[02:19:30]  it's bad enough  cleaning up my son's shit  we had a little dog  when I was growing up  and it kept rubbing  its ass on the carpet  and we're like  we brought it to the vet  we're like  what's the problem  they're called scooting  yeah  they're like  well it's anal glands  get swollen  and you've gotta  you've gotta squeeze them  okay  you've gotta release  well it was nice  knowing you puppy  yeah  you gotta squeeze  the dog's asshole veins  literally is what  they were saying to us  for how long  once 
[02:20:00]  like once a month  oh fuck you  fuck you  let nature fix that  how do they survive  before we decide  to take them  into our homes  I'd rather put my finger  in its ass  and scratch it  than fucking squeeze  its anal glands  yeah like  how were they surviving  before a human  got the idea  to put their fingers  up there  and squeeze it  oh  we were just  literally  we got rid of it  we got a guy  we live in the country  we have four dogs  my dog's shit  and each other's  and then they eat  eat each other's shit  excuse me  I got slid out of it  good lord 
[02:20:30]  and then they vomit  it back up  oh  why  what are you not  getting in your life  that makes you  put up with that  I got an animal lover  in my family  my brother Brett  yeah  he's the  him and his wife  they take in all the  dogs and cats  oh really  all the strays  so we went over there  for Thanksgiving  and I'm even more  allergic to cats  bad  oh man  and there's a few  other people in my family  you know  deathly allergic to cats  yeah  and they keep a spotless place  so it's not like 
[02:21:00]  they're not  yeah  you know  keeping the dander down  and half of us  were sneezing our asses off  and it turns out  they won't tell us  how many cats  are in the house  I saw  I saw what I thought  were different cats  but now I'm not sure  I thought I was seeing  I mean I  I thought I was seeing  the same cat  excuse me  but now I'm starting  to think it was a lot  of different cats  that are similar  in their appearance  so it's really like  20 cats  they'll admit to 5  5  that's what they admit to  but  I mean 
[02:21:30]  I'll ask  how many cats  you got  they're like  you know  and I go  5  how do you survive  a whole Thanksgiving  it was supposed to be  a whole thing  a sleepover  I haven't been out  to Long Island  in a while  we had to get a hotel  man  really  just bail  my brother even said  he's like  yeah you can't stay here  oh man  yeah  we have this little kitten  in my  my daughter's friend  comes over  he's highly allergic  but a little kid 
[02:22:00]  can't stop  picking up a kitten  right  so she just picks up  and her eyes are tearing  and snot's pulling down  her face  I just love him so much  I just love him so much  kids are stupid  there's still dog shit  everywhere  I know it  I love kittens  hire a cleaner  but I know I can't touch them  can't touch them  steam cleaning  fucking  shoot that fucking machine  they'll take the smell out  but you have shit everywhere 
[02:22:30]  I hire a fucking professional  to come in and clean the mat  in my bathroom  really  no  just kidding  no we got the same  cleaning lady  me and Jimmy share  a cleaning lady  she's doing me today  yeah she's good  yeah  I have to have someone  clean  you know she's getting  a little chubby  I called her by the way  she's great  she was too busy  I know  she blew off Tom Papa  she's too popular  oh really  we're passing our  cleaning lady around  to everybody  trying to give her  some fucking business  I'm gonna have a  conversation with her  because she looks  a little chubby right now  oh yeah  yo who's that  it's the holiday weight  it's the cookie weight 
[02:23:00]  some big important people  just walked by  who's that  Santa Claus  Wiz Khalifa's out there  oh is he  yeah he's doing Sway  where is he  he just went in  oh I'll take a picture  with him  who's he again  he's a big rapper  Wiz  Wiz  yeah isn't he  yeah he's huge  I've heard the name  he just went into  Sway's studio  oh okay  he sings a lot  about marijuana  he smells a lot  like marijuana  all the hallways  really  he reeks of weed  right now  really  can I take a picture  with him  I wonder why  I can't be that  kind of guy 
[02:23:30]  that just  some celebrities  you're just  high 24 7  and people take care  of you  and they tell you  when you gotta be  places  must be nice  yeah how do you  do that  he's got like  an 8 person  entourage with him  that's stupid  he's spending all  his money  don't they learn  from the hammer  they don't learn  they gotta learn  from the hammer  hammer got broke  because he was  trying to take care  of too many people  but it was a really  poignant  father moment  when I tracked  dog shit  everywhere 
[02:24:00]  like cause I knew  like  I wanted to blow  right  but I knew  you got these  little kids  they're all excited  for the tree  right  it was like  it was a buddhist  moment  that I wasn't just  throwing the tree  cursing at everyone  you couldn't do it  tomorrow  you know what I mean  I literally was like  you were zen  I was zen  you just by the way  that will affect  who she marries  cause like you know  like she'll remember  dad being a nice guy  and quiet  she's not gonna marry 
[02:24:30]  some abusive asshole  right  because you know  dad threw the tree  down the fucking  elevator  and screamed  fuck you kids  and threw his  dog shit shoe  at us  and sulked in his room  which is everything  you wanna do  your instinct  wants to do that  well then you know  like after you have  one of those freak outs  everyone's looking at you  like what the fuck  is wrong with you  I know  exactly  you just feel like  an idiot  exactly  I might have done  that a few times  over the years  I just stood in the kitchen  downed a beer  in like two gulps  really  I was like  alright let's do  the tree everybody 
[02:25:00]  bum bum bum bum  bum bum bum bum  bum bum  I think I'm getting  the snowing  Christmas tree this year  what do you mean  what's that  I went from a guy  that really  blew off Christmas  for probably a good  decade  to all in again  you gotta go all in  I've been all in  for about eight years  though now  but now with the kids  now I'm starting  to really appreciate  some of this shit  they come up with  how old's the oldest  two and a half  yeah two and a half  oh man  it's just starting  to get to prime time  two and a half  and now two months  for the young one  I shouldn't even be here 
[02:25:30]  I should be just  raising my kids  for a while  nah  this doesn't affect that  this is only a few  hours a day  we're done by ten  doesn't affect it  my god  I got two jobs  and I go home  and I have to be  a full time father  but I mean  this is the easiest job  you'll ever have  with children  I mean like  imagine working  nine to five  in a warehouse  well the option is  not work at all  I don't need  to work anymore  you don't want to do that  you don't want to do that  you don't want to be there  all the time  I came real close  a couple months ago  did you really  oh wow  oh really  I was kind of  talked into it  really  I'm happy I'm here  don't get me wrong 
[02:26:00]  yeah yeah  it started to look  real good to just  no  just not work for a while  it's good for like a  like a  two or three days  a month yeah  and then you really get like  alright get me out of here  I do not  belong here  changing diapers  it's not  yeah  I don't mind  do you ever minded  changing diapers  no  I was happy to help out  I thought it would be way worse  I don't care  no  it doesn't bother me at all  every once in a while  you get a bad one  where you're like  holy fuck  smell like a homeless guy  we had this diaper genie thing 
[02:26:30]  yeah we got that  and you twist it  and then it comes out  like a sausage  yeah  we got that  like 20 diapers in a row  I love throwing that down  the garbage chute  and I live about 500 feet  in the air  I can only imagine  what happens  when that hits  at the bottom  it's gotta explode  like a bomb  oh that thing is brutal  it has to  that thing stinks  it doesn't stink  cause then  it's all contained  yeah but once in a while  they snap open  and  oh  it's brutal

The other guy was loud  To the morning guy  Right  At my radio station  Uh huh  And um  I'm amazed they're still doing it  And you did it this past year  Yeah  A couple months ago  A month ago  Just this month  Yeah  Dennis Leary  Who was on the lineup?  Uh  Don Gavin  Doing his local shit  Yeah  Hilarious  And I mean that in a good way  By the way  What a classic  The Godfather of Boston comedy  Right  Uh  Adam Ferrara  Greg Fitzsimmons  And uh  It was at a 
[02:43:00]  Sweeney?  No Sweeney  Why no Sweeney?  No Sweeney  I don't know  But they had uh  Lenny Clock  I love Lenny Clark  Lenny Clock  Who's lost like 500 pounds  Well we got the fat version  Of Lenny Clark  Yeah  As soon as he started losing the weight  He's done with us  Really?  I guess  Wow  We're salted there  Lenny Clark  We like Lenny Clark  Maybe he  Maybe it brings back  Food issues  When he comes here  Maybe  But it was really great  They did it at  Boston University  Uh huh  At the hockey arena 
[02:43:30]  It's a packed  Packed arena  Were you saying about 10,000 people?  Yeah  It felt like that  Wow  It was big  It's a big hockey arena  That's great  Yeah it was good  And um  So they tell me  I'm going on  Second to last  And uh  I'm like  So who's on before me?  Fitzsimmons?  They're like  Yeah Fitzsimmons  But then we're gonna play  A video of uh  Patrice  With us  Comics from home?  Yeah  And uh  I was like  Oh okay  Then I'm  Immediately concerned 
[02:44:00]  Cause it's gonna be sad  They're like  No no no  It's not gonna  It's a bit of his  From his special  That didn't air  On Comedy Central  Uh  That you know  They edited it out  For time or whatever  So we're gonna play that  Just like a set  Like a five minute thing  I was like  Oh okay  That sounds nice  So I'm waiting  In the wings  And uh  They bring up  They introduce him  You know  It's been a year  And we miss this guy  He used to come  Do it all the time  He's so great  And  The great 
[02:44:30]  Patrice O'Neill  And they play the video  And you think like  Oh so people just  Sit back and watch it  And be like  Oh that was cool  Nice little tribute  Right sure  He kills  Oh my god  It's a hockey arena  With 10,000 people  And he is  Killing  Killing  This bit  About uh  People being mean  To animals  And it's just  Killing  And I'm like  Son of a bitch  I immediately  Selfishly go from 
[02:45:00]  Well this is gonna be sad  To  I can't believe  I'm gonna have  Trouble following  Patrice again  Right  You thought  That's one thing  I don't have to  Worry about anymore  Right exactly  Since our friend  Has passed  Right  I don't have to  Follow him ever again  On stage  You don't have to  Follow this legend  How'd you do  I did fine  I did fine  But it was just  That's a tough spot  For a comic huh  But it was just  So impressive  To watch  I mean  Literally  That's how good  I mean  I have to tell you  But that's how good  To just have a video 
[02:45:30]  Go up  And have an arena  Just laughing  Like genuinely  Like he's there  In the room  It was pretty great  I'm just sad  I'm just sad as a comic  That my videos  Wouldn't make people  Laugh like that  It's right back to me  I love Patrice  But fuck him  I'm more worried  About my shit  Not getting laughs  Than his greatness  Yeah  But it was cool  And it was cool  Of Leary to do it  And it was really great  Sam I like pointing out  Where your raise is going  You know that  It's one of our 
[02:46:00]  Ongoing bits  What's that?  Sam hasn't had  A real raise  In a long time ago  They give him silly raises  Every once in a while  What does he need a raise  For when he's doing  So well on YouTube?  Attaboy  There you go  Good point Tommy  Your latest raise money  Is going toward  Eddie Vedder  Who will be hosting  A limited run show  On Sirius XM  You know they're paying him  A shit load of money  To do this  A lot of people  Will subscribe to  Satellite Radio  When they find out  That Eddie Vedder  Is hosting a show  For like two weeks 
[02:46:30]  Right  So what kind of show  Will it be?  I love Eddie Vedder  And I love Pearl Jam  What's he doing?  I just feel like  They could spend the money  In a better way  Like giving raises  To people like you  And others  That haven't had a raise  Around here in a long time  Eddie Vedder  Buried treasures  How about you  Give everyone a raise  That hasn't had a raise  In a really long time  And then you bring people  Like Eddie Vedder  To the platform  How about you do that?  You could develop talent  How about you do that?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Can I hear enemy  In the beginning  With yeah  Yeah 
[02:47:00]  We're in no man's land  By the way  It's called in radio  We can't really start anything  Because we got  The big star coming in  So we gotta just  Fuck around  For like seven minutes  Morgan Freeman's here  Jimmy's preparing  For the big interview  He's jotting down  Actual questions Jimmy?  Yes  He's the Hobbit?  Yeah he's the Hobbit  Oh  He's in the original office  Original office  I saw you give us a look  When I said  We saw the Hobbit  Yeah we did  What?  And it's not out  For another what  Ten days 
[02:47:30]  How did you see it?  Special screening  What?  Yep  Is it good?  It's amazing  Really?  And I'm not a  Lord of the Rings guy  Do their feet smell?  I saw the  Lord of the Rings trilogy  And I couldn't tell you  I couldn't tell you  What happens  I know  I don't know  It's just Gollum  And  Oh it's cool  Any of those  And a lot of cool  Battle scenes  But I couldn't tell you  The ins and outs  Of the Lord of the Rings  You can't keep track  Of the lands  And the people  And you gotta learn  New vocabulary  Yeah especially  When it's all made up  Right  You know if you  If you see a movie 
[02:48:00]  And they mention Russia  You're like  Oh I know a little bit  About Russia  Okay I'm in  Exactly  But when they have  Something made up of land  Right  It fucks up your brain  I'm like  Well what are they  Doing this made up land  He's going to  Crystalline  To meet with  Mordor  Of the Linglangs  Right  Fucking  Clerp City  What  Clerp City  Where the fuck  Are the Linglangs  Exactly  It's the worst  But you could fill in  That shit  If it's real places  Like oh okay  Oh they're going to China  Okay I know a little bit  About it  Right  Alright  You have an idea 
[02:48:30]  The Klingklongs  Who the fuck  Are the Klingklongs  Are they good  Are they bad  Right  But the people  That read the books  And are all in  They know  They know all that shit  In and out  They know that big time  Inside jokes  They're like in the movie  They'll be like  That's  They're acting like  A Klingklapper  Oh that's crazy  They had some long scene  With Cate Blanchett  Was it  Right Jimmy  Cate Blanchett's in the movie  Is she  I think she was  They only have  Oh  Cate Blanchett 
[02:49:00]  Or Blanchett  Blanchett  Blanchett  I know who she is  I don't know  What she looks like  Liv Tyler  She was in that one scene  Where they were talking a lot  And I remember thinking to myself  This is a really important scene  And that's all I  I could tell you about it  It's all you're saying  They're setting up how  Oh boy  Oh this is a risky thing  You're about to do  That's all I know  I'm a hobbit  They only had two women  In the whole film  Yeah  You notice that Jimmy  Liv Tyler  Who's Liv Tyler  She plays an elf 
[02:49:30]  Or something  No that was in  Lord of the Rings  Oh  Oh you're talking about  The Hobbit  Yeah  In The Hobbit  They have  Cate Blanchett  And then some lady  Playing the flute  That were the only  The only two women  In the whole film  It's a hobbit sausage fest  Although when the hobbit's  Running through the village  When he decides  He's going on the adventure  You see a couple  Women going  Where are you going  And that was it  For women in this film  You'll never come back  Oh what  What is big  Fucking furry feet 
[02:50:00]  Why the furry feet  I don't know  Do you know  Any of this shit  I just know  It was a good movie  I don't know why  They have furry feet  We're the worst people  To interview the big star  Of The Hobbit  I'm Morgan Freeman  Geeks would love  This interview spot  Now we'll ask good questions  You think he wants to  Just talk about hobbit shit  That he doesn't know  Yeah  He might be a big hobbit fan  He's a funny guy  Yes he is  But he doesn't like  Being a celebrity  A lot of guys like that  Just don't  Like really great actors  A lot of them  Genuinely just like  Ugh  Just fucking  That's how I feel 
[02:50:30]  Just as a great actor  Do you know  Yeah well that's the beauty  Of where you're at  In your career  Is you don't have to worry about it  Do you understand  The main plot  Of The Hobbit  Jim Norton  Yes  I do  Are they trying to get  Their land back  Or something  Yeah they're trying  To recapture something  That's been taken from them  Yeah  Yeah  Precious  Yeah they want to get  Some shit back  Like who the fuck  Is precious  Precious  Did you know  Who's precious  I don't  I don't  There you go  No  Precious  What  The ring for 
[02:51:00]  Not you to go  Oh  That's make believe  Lons  But that was very good  Doug  That was great  The 3D was so amazing  Yeah  It was great  It was  I can't stress enough  How well that was shot  Really  Yeah  I understand why  People got nauseous  I didn't feel for the whole movie  Just like the first 20 minutes  But it's a weird experience  People got nauseous  Oh yeah  No one's fucked up  Avatar is what  Maybe three years old  At this point  Four  Yeah  It's already four  I betcha  You sure  No  Let's go with three 
[02:51:30]  Alright  Just for the argument  The technology  Between Avatar  And The Hobbit  Is  And when you saw Avatar  You're like wow  It's never going to get better than this  And already  Three years later  I mean this movie blows away  The Avatar  Really  It's back  Wow  I can't even explain it  This new screen  What did we say yesterday  It's like the old school viewfinder  It's like looking at a viewmaster  The way they take you out of reality  Yeah  Remember the viewmaster  Where it's all around you  You got the illusion  That it's all  Immersed  Immersed  Thank you  That's what you feel  Watching this new technology  More than 3D 
[02:52:00]  3D you kind of know  You're looking at 3D  And all that  That's awesome  It's more like  You feel like this shit going on  To the sides of you  And possibly even behind you  Jeez  It's not like those  Lame 3D  Where they just  Throw a watch at you  I said that too  Because I'm so sick of movies  Where like  We have to remind you  3D look  And they just throw shit  That has nothing to do with the movie  This movie  They were confident enough  In the story and everything  Where it's like  We filmed it in 3D  They gave you  Like Jimmy said  A couple little things 
[02:52:30]  A butterfly  Which was kind of cool  And I think a bird  Besides that  They didn't throw it in your face  To remind you  Guess what  3D  How cool is this shit  Because they didn't need to  There was one scene  Where they're all walking  Along a mountain ridge  And they kind of do  Like a helicopter view  Over them  But you really felt  Like you were just  Hovering over people  Looking at them walk  It didn't feel like a movie  It was a really bizarre  Experience  And the first spoiler  There's helicopters  In The Hobbit  Yes  It was really weird  What? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah he's a helicopter pilot  It's like a full metal jacket scene  Wait a minute  I don't know a lot about it  But I don't remember  There are helicopters  In The Hobbit  I don't think that that's  I don't think that's the time  That they had  But that make believe land shit  Drives me nuts  In these movies  Yeah  Yeah  With these people  You have no idea  Oh he's  Are they bad guys?  Right  Like if you say  You must go talk  To the Prince of Scandia  Right  What?  Is that the Middle East?  Over the  Over the 
[02:53:30]  Seraphin Mountains  And through  Lap-lops  Ooh  I guess I should feel something  I have no  No clue  Can I  Can I  Plug a little something  That Jimmy's gonna be a part of?

[02:59:30]  We love you  Very kind  And to start off  We found out today  We saw the movie  And it was unbelievable  It really was  You don't even have to promote this  I don't even know why you're here  Neither do I  To be honest  Neither do I  I think you should just  Carry on talking  And just complimenting me  And my work generally  Are they making you do a lot  Are you running all over  A little bit  Yeah  It's doable  It's okay  Sure  All New York  Yeah in the States  Yeah  I'm not going across the way  That's good  London next  It's a good time to be in New York 
[03:00:00]  Yeah  It's nice  It's like spring  Yeah  I know  Yeah it's been warm  I know  It's creepy  It's like 60 today  I think at least  Yeah  That's why we're sinking underwater  It's a little creepy  I mean you enjoy it  But then you really wonder  What the heck's going on  You got a one  I know  It's scary  But you're grateful for it  I mean global warming sucks in the summer  But in December  It's like global warming is not so bad  I'll take it  You don't have a climate change  I do but only now  What about a white Christmas  Don't you miss a white Christmas  I've never had a white Christmas  We talked about that earlier  I've never had one 
[03:00:30]  It's always  Yeah these Christmas songs  All talk about a white Christmas  And we don't actually get one  Like a slight gray Christmas  Yeah it's very gray  Yeah  Very brown  We get brown Christmases  Is it warmer in London?  It's about the same  I think it's colder  I think it's colder  Oh it's colder  The Hobbit was  We were blown away  And just so you know  I'm not a Lord of the Rings  Like Uber  Geek  Nerd  Whatever you want to call him  I don't  You know  Just as a film itself  It's an amazing film  People  I think he's done  Brilliantly 
[03:01:00]  I think so  He's made a really  Really good film  It's thrilling  You know  It was honestly like  I've seen it twice now  Yeah it's a thrill  Visually  It's so amazing  That at times  I'm like  Wow look at that waterfall  Over there  I'm like oh shit  Something's happening  That I gotta pay attention to  Yeah yeah yeah  You start wandering around  The screen looking at  All the cool stuff  I thought I was gonna have  To walk out at one point  And we pointed this out  This morning on the air  I didn't know it was happening  Because I felt nauseous  And I thought that I'd eaten something  I literally felt sick 
[03:01:30]  For probably the first half hour  I didn't know  And other people are getting that  And it's a compliment  To how well this 3D is  You feel like you're  It's a weird experience  It doesn't feel like  You're watching a movie  And I know you're gonna have  An option to see  The regular 3D  Or this new technology  I highly recommend  You find time to  So you saw it in 48 frames  Yes  Yeah exactly  Have you seen that version of it  Yeah I've seen  The only two times I've seen it  Has been 3D 48 frames  Yeah  So but I mean  I think it would 
[03:02:00]  I think they need a better name  It'll work  You know  Either way you see it  Sure  They need a better name  Than did you see it  In 48 frames per second  Yeah there has to be  A cooler name for that  A cooler name  I've seen a collection of  High frame rate  HFR  Maybe it's H  That's the one  HFR  HFR  That sounds  Marginally cooler  Yeah  How did you get this  This role  Because I've heard  Peter Jackson was a fan of yours  What actually got you  This  Charm  Money  I don't know 
[03:02:30]  I mean I think he  You know he's a  He's a big watcher  Of British television  I guess  And the odd film I've done  So yeah  I mean  Hitchhiker  I've met him a while ago  Hitchhiker  Yeah I think so  You're great in that  Thank you  I don't really know  What he'd seen  Apart from  I know he'd seen Sherlock  And I guess  He'd probably seen The Office  I suppose  Because he's a big comedy fan  But yeah I don't know  Fortunately we never really discussed it  And sometimes it's kind of good  Not to know  What got you something  Do you know what I mean  Yeah  You just kind of get on with it 
[03:03:00]  Well I should say  Do I know what you mean  I've heard  Not that I've ever gotten anything  So the answer is no I don't  Did you have to read for it  Did you just offer  I read for it  When it was initially  Guillermo del Toro  Was going to be the director  So I read for it in  Like early 2010  Oh wow  When Guillermo was still the director  But I turned up at the reading in London  With this message from Guillermo  Saying that we want this to be you  You know do a good reading  Because you're the person for us  As far as we're concerned  Which was a nice little vote of confidence anyway  And then as time went on 
[03:03:30]  Guillermo left the project  And Peter came on  And he made it very clear all the time  That I was still their number one choice  So yeah it was nice  It always felt like it was my job  It was a strange situation  That's great  Wow  Yeah it was lovely  What a relief  How much of your scenes  Were done with green screen  A fair few  I mean it was definitely  What percent do you think  Because at times  You're not even sure  If it's green screen  Yeah I know  I know  Because I know you've filmed  I've seen the film  I can't fully remember sometimes 
[03:04:00]  Really  Because I think  Because it is so  You know the people  At Weta Digital  The digital people down there  Are so amazing  Right  There are scenes in it  That I go  I can't even remember  Whether that was in a green screen  Or if that was a real tree  Right  A lot of it is a mixture of both  Sure  So there would be  You know like half a set  You know  So that you know  The foreground would be  You know  Would be real stuff  Right  And then the background  Would be green  But it's a real  It's probably  It felt kind of 50-50  Or maybe 60-40  Real  How odd is it to see something 
[03:04:30]  And remember shooting it  And then just see like birds  Or whatever  All these odd things  Thrown into your  Absolutely  I was doing  You know  When we were looping the film  You know  A few months ago  And I would be  You know  I'd be looping scenes  You know what looping is  Yeah  And where there would be  Unfinished CG in the background  And I thought  Oh well  You know  They've still got that to do  And then a couple of months later  It's an entire universe  Wow  It's  You know  I won't give away anything  But the climax  Of this first film  You know  Where we're  You know 
[03:05:00]  Carried away  I'm miming  Everyone  I'm miming  Yeah  But that bit  That was really unfinished  Even when I was doing it  A couple of months ago  And it looks stunning  It just looks so good  You know  But there are  There are  There are digital artists  Who individually spend  Their entire two years  Just making sure  That foot is on that rock  Or making sure  That droplet of water  Falls properly  You know  It's the  Sort of minutiae of work  Is  Wow  Is unbelievable  So it costs like  $30,000 to make  It costs  No  It's $50,000  $50,000 
[03:05:30]  This isn't expensive  Yeah  That's for the 48 frames  Four FRs  We like to call it  And when you guys  We asked Ricky  When he was in too  Because what was amazing  Ricky  Oh Gervais  Oh sure  The original  I forgot his last name actually  The amazing part about  That show  Is it looked  So improv  And it's hard to make  Scripted things look  Improv  But he said no  It was very carefully  It was  It was  I mean  Yes it was  It was scripted  So I wouldn't say  It was improvised 
[03:06:00]  But I would also say  It was loose  I mean there are lines  That I know  Are mine in it  And there are lines  That I know  You know  Because in the moment  They encouraged  You know  They encouraged you  To bring what  You're going to bring to it  But yeah  It was absolutely scripted  But it's also true  That you know  There was  It was loose  You know  What do you think  Because I think  That that show  Does something for me  In a weird way  That most shows don't do  It's different  Than just a regular  Comedy  What do you think  It is about  Those 12 episodes  In the Christmas special  That make that show  It's really a masterpiece 
[03:06:30]  Thank you  What do you think  It is about it  That makes it that  I think  Part  Well a big part of it  Is Ricky and Steve's  Steve Merchant's  Determination  To keep it  You know  In house  You know  I mean they turned up  As two people  Who didn't have  A track record  Who  Managed to  Write and direct  Their own show  For the BBC  Which is  Pretty rare  You know  I mean  To have no  Kind of background  In that  And to come on  And just have  The determination  Because you know  You have the ability  To make the show 
[03:07:00]  You want to make  And not give any of it away  It was  A lot of it  Is down to their taste  It was  You know  I do think  It's a beautiful show  You know  I'm extremely proud of it  Whether I was in it or not  I know I would have liked it  Is there a thing  When  Because it  Was 12 or 13  12 and a Christmas special  Yeah  I mean the  Two Christmas specials  Yeah  And  In the States  You know  They try and do  Like a hundred  And you get to syndication  And do all that  Is there  A feeling like  Oh no  We're doing good work  So that's cool  We can end at 13 
[03:07:30]  Or do you feel like  Oh we should be doing  A hundred  Like  To be honest  I never  Ever  I always  That was one of the things  I most admired  About Ricky and Steve  Was that they  Called it a day  Right  I love the fact  That it was finite  And I love the fact  That it had an end  Yeah  I think  You know  There are some shows  That can go on  For a hundred  And two hundred episodes  And they're good  Right  But  But some of them aren't  You know  And I just think  It's much better  To end something  When it's still good  Is it different  In British TV  Where you know  These series  Don't go on forever  Like we have in America 
[03:08:00]  They don't  I mean  They're just going in general  There isn't the financial incentive  You know  That thing is  Reaching syndication  And then you can all  Print your own money  Right  There just isn't  That sort of culture  So the Irish show  Would go only  Two or three years  Over there right  No I mean  There were lots  That would go  Five or six  Or seven  You know  There are  You know  I mean  The office was  Conspicuously short  You know  One more season  You probably are thinking  One more season  Would have been nice  Absolutely  Well  I mean  I was all  I love the fact  That it was so short  I loved it  I think because also  For everyone involved  You know  Fawlty Towers  Was probably the blueprint 
[03:08:30]  Of it  And that's 12 episodes  As well  That's amazing  Fawlty Towers  Is only 12 episodes  And the impact of it  Are you kidding me  And the impact of it  Like the office  In your mind  It's just as big  As something that went  To syndication  I felt like that  Wow  I thought that was  Yeah  And this is the longest  Running show I think  In history  Is in Britain  It's what  It begins with a C  It's the soap opera  Oh Coronation  Coronation Street  I mean yeah  That's been going  Since 1960  Yeah  How can you be  So wrapped up  In one story  That you're 60 years in 
[03:09:00]  Well  There's lots of stories  It's a very rich tapestry  But yeah  As far as that  Half hour comedy thing  Is concerned  It's rare for things  To go on and on  And on  You know  Because the thing is  In this country  It's also written differently  You know  The teams of writers  That's a whole different  Way of doing things  And people kind of get  You know  People  I've heard Americans  Get sniffy about  Oh by series 10  Of Friends  How about  But I think  By series 10  Of Friends  I was still laughing  Four times an episode  Right  It's like  It's still  Pretty good actually  Yeah  Absolutely  By episode 500 
[03:09:30]  Of The Simpsons  I'm still pretty good  I just think  It depends on  What the show is  Some shows  Well they can play  On pop culture too  So that's endless  Yeah  But you know  What's so great too  Is the way that  The office didn't go  For certain jokes  Like they would just  Leave certain  Uncomfortable moments  Hanging  Like when he  Introduces you  As Tim Canterbury  And he just goes  The Canterbury Tales  Like what a dumb  Shithead thing  To say that  I think  What the  I think what the show  I think the 
[03:10:00]  The thing that  Tipped it over  For me  Of being  Between being very good  And being great  Actually  Is that they  Committed to the thing  Of it being a docu  You know  A sort of  Mocumentary thing  And of course  There are always  Going to be cheats  Around that  Because it's not  Just a single  You know  Otherwise you'd never  Cut away or anything  You know  But I just think  We committed stylistically  To that  More than most  Of those things do  There wasn't  Winking to the  Unless it was  My character  Knowingly breaking  The fourth wall  And looking  Down the barrel  But there wasn't  A lot of winking  To the camera  And telling the audience  This is where the joke is 
[03:10:30]  The first episode  Was reviewed  Pretty kind of  Up and down  People were going  Who is this guy  This David Brent  Carrier  He's fluffing his lines  A lot of people  Did not know  It was a  Fictional show  Because it was brand new  They didn't know  What to make of it  But also  Because we weren't going  Hey we're making  A comedy show  About a documentary  You know  It's like  And again  Another massive  Thing for all  One of the things  I bonded with Ricky over  Was well it was  Lauren and Hardy  The Simpsons and Spinal Tap  And those were the things 
[03:11:00]  That kind of  They were all in there  You know  They were all in there  I mean my looks  To the camera  Were pure Oliver  Absolutely  But your ability  Like just listening  To you talk now  It's not that much different  I mean I think  As Tim you were more  Of a nervous  Or unsure guy  And you're more confident  But it also is the same  As kind of  Like watching you  In The Hobbit  It was like  And I love the fact  That you  I hate when they say  That you play the guy  Not the uniform  Like you didn't  Play a hobbit  You just played  It seemed like  A real person  Who was a hobbit 
[03:11:30]  There was something  About that  That was very easy  To connect with  And I found it  Very interesting to watch  He's different  From other hobbits  You've met  Yeah I've met  Quite a few  I've fucked more  Than my share  Speaking of The Hobbit  I mean we don't want  To give too much away  Obviously that's why  We're talking around  The whole movie  But Stephen Philly writes  Some purists are angry  That The Hobbit  Was split into three films  Not just one  Excuse me  Not just one  Yeah  Why?  If you love The Hobbit  Don't you want to see more of it?  This movie was two hours and forty minutes  And there's not  And it wasn't slow at all  I can't imagine  You squeeze all that into one film 
[03:12:00]  No I mean  Both times I've seen it  I must admit  For real  I thought we had about an hour to go  When we reached the end  I was like  Is that really it?  You know  It goes along  It's such a lick  Absolutely  I wanted more  You didn't want this film to end  No I do  There was something happening  I won't say what it was  Right before the end  And I'm like  Oh no  Oh no  And then all of a sudden  The fucking thing  And it ended  I was like  Fuck  I knew they were going to do that  And it was like  I wanted more of it  I really really enjoyed this  I'm glad  I took my brother  And his twelve year old son 
[03:12:30]  Thirteen year old son  And that's what they said  As soon as the film ended  They're like  Oh we've got to wait a year  He was in his mind  Yeah yeah  But there's no way  You could put the three films into one  There's no way  I don't think so  And also because  You know  Peter Jackson  And Fran Walsh  And Philippa Boyens  Who are the co-writers  And the producers of the film  You know  They love Tolkien  And they know Tolkien  Better than anyone else I know  Maybe apart from Stephen Colbert  You know  But they are fanatical about  Getting detail in  And getting  You know  Getting points in the story across 
[03:13:00]  That the purists will actually love  You know  Because  So  They don't have to skate across it  And just be kind of surface with it  They want to really present you with the story  Sure  Are they all done?  No  We have to  We go back next year to kind of  Because we were going to go back next year  When it was going to be two films  We had pickups to do  I mean we've got to sort of  Shoot the denouement of the whole story  You know  There's a big battle we've got to do  Right  So we've got to  But we've got to go back anyway  And now it's going to be three films  That will be elongated that period  Yeah  That's great  There's a lot of comedy in this film too 
[03:13:30]  A lot more comedy than Lord of the Rings  Yeah there is  But there's more comedy in the book  And I like that  You know  The tone of The Hobbit as a book is lighter  And it's a bit more familial  Yeah  It's kind of more  I mean it's a lot of people's first books  You know  Like a lot of friends of mine  That was the first book they read  Or had read to them  You know  I think I'm going to finally read The Hobbit  Yeah I will  After all these years  I know  But I like not knowing where it goes too  I kind of like  You don't have to be a Hobbit fan  To like the movie  I like not knowing  What was happening  It's funny you say that  Because my brother  I go to him  Did you know everything that was going to happen  And he looked at me like 
[03:14:00]  Yeah idiot  I've read The Hobbit ten times  Of course I know  They're telling us that we have to wrap Martin  Because he has other press  We'd like to go long form with you one day Martin  Next time to come back in  Yeah  Yes that's with you in the middle  And two of us asking questions  It's tough to get everything in in 15 minutes  But please come back and still  That also sounds sexual  Stop coming home  I'll be your straight man  Fuck it  See that doesn't sound sexual  It comes out in I think the 14th is the date 
[03:14:30]  Correct  Ten days to go  And it's the greatest shot film I've ever seen  And you don't have to be a Tolkien fan to like the movie  Because I knew nothing about it  I've never seen Lord of the Rings  And I loved it  And you're brilliant man  Thank you  You're a great actor  Your performance was amazing  Thank you very much  Martin Freeman from The Hobbit  We'll see you tomorrow  Thanks man  Yeah that's it  The O.B. and Anthony Show is pretty much over  This show will be available later today  With Sirius XM On Demand  After ONA Live is next </pre>
