<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  The show began with nonsensical chatter before moving to a discussion of their failed Cleveland broadcast due to insufficient funding and personnel issues.  This segued into a heated discussion about a suicide bombing in Israel, with Anthony using inflammatory language to criticize George W. Bush's response. This was followed by listener calls, including a prank call about infidelity, a listener thanking them for an earworm song, and a caller detailing his wife's infidelity.  Comedian Paul Mercurio called in, discussing a recent performance and recounting an incident where he insulted an audience member, leading to a discussion about offensive jokes and violence against women.

A significant portion focused on reviewing their "rider" and recounting their debaucherous New Orleans trip, including intoxicated crew members, a station owner licking Jim Norton's head, and various sexually suggestive and explicit anecdotes.  This was interspersed with more listener calls, including "FU" messages, a discussion of a finger transplant, and further commentary on priests engaging in sexual misconduct.  Jim Norton was a guest in studio during this portion.  The Mini-Wheat commercial actor also appeared as a guest, leading to a discussion about the commercial and his experiences. The segment ended with uncertainty about the show's future in a particular city.  Throughout, the hosts frequently used profanity and offensive language.

Comedian Jeff Norris then joined as a guest.  The discussion covered Norris's recent work, including a bizarre SNL-related skit, a physical altercation with his ex-girlfriend's brother (with graphic descriptions of injuries), and severe chemical burns from a cement job.  The segment featured antagonistic banter between Norris and the hosts, with numerous insults and crude jokes.  Norris discussed his upcoming appearance at the U.S. Comedy Festival and expressed mixed feelings about Opie and Anthony.  The hosts also discussed the potential cancellation of their show and the Catholic priest scandals, playing audio clips of a comedic song and a humorous phone call.

The next segment began with Opie describing a fictional, elaborate plan reminiscent of "Mission Impossible" or "Grand Theft Auto."  This transitioned into discussions of Opie's college fraternity experience (including a darkly humorous anecdote about a professor), Anthony's invitation to an EverQuest gaming guild, and a listener (Keith, a police officer) recounting an awkward experience delivering show merchandise. Further calls included comedian Jimmy Schubert (who toured with Sam Kinison), sharing stories about past interactions with Opie and Anthony and Roseanne Barr.  Psycho Tim, a known confrontational listener, detailed a live on-air altercation with another radio host, Rocco, at a bar, including phone calls disrupting Rocco's show.  The segment also included discussions of fetishes from a magazine article and a man's penis reconstruction using his middle finger (with a call from a cancer doctor, Dr. Eric).  The segment concluded with further discussion of Psycho Tim's actions.

The final segment began with a discussion of listener complaints, contrasting positive feedback on a mammogram segment with negative responses.  The hosts promoted an OzFest ticket giveaway and played a Wesley Willis song selected by "Awesome Garrett." The "FU Line" featured listener-submitted angry messages.  A significant portion addressed the hosts' impending removal from a Rochester radio station, with angry commentary directed at station management (John McRae, Kevin LeGrette, and "Fred Flintstone"). The hosts vowed retribution and expressed their intent to find a new Rochester affiliate.  Tim Sabean, who managed some of their other stations, called in live.  The show ended with the "What Did We Learn?" segment, plugs, and hints at future surprises and conflicts.

[00:04:30]  Yeah  Hey, Jesus Christ, we're going to in  Ooh  Who you are calling you ladies  She's my hair spot, boy  Ha, ha, ha, ha  He, he, he  Mule  And  You are one pathetic loser  And you, you, you, you, okay, okay, all right. 
[00:05:00]  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Walk, Priest, Paul, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  That's what I say.  And my new favorite.  Today was yesterday, because yesterday was so close, like almost like it was the same day. 
[00:05:30]  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I'm telling me to shut up because you said who?  Couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027, anywhere else outside of New York, including, once again, Cleveland.  Jim Norton up there today for a show tonight, actually.  Oh, yeah?  And we should be broadcasting from Cleveland today, but I don't know what happened.  They couldn't really figure it out in Cleveland.  Something went horribly wrong.  Is that what happened?  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  I think we asked for too much to bring the crew to Cleveland or something.  All we needed was a couple hotel rooms and a couple flights.  Yeah, we're not.  It wasn't like we were asking for just green M&Ms or anything.  We're not that high maintenance.  Yeah, we don't have Van Halen-like riders when we go places.  We need a comfortable place to stay, and that's about it.  A tub of beer?  Yeah, some beer.  And a way to get to Cleveland.  And broadcast facilities.  Yeah.  For Friday's show.  So, I mean, we definitely tried to get to Cleveland, and it didn't work out. 
[00:06:30]  What was the problem?  I don't know.  I mean, they support the show and stuff.  Oh, no, they absolutely do.  But is it one of those situations where maybe they don't have the facilities and the money to...  They didn't have enough money.  Oh, how much money does it cost to bring this show somewhere?  Not that much, but...  It can't be that much.  I know I pay my own minibar bill, so it's really not, you know, ridiculous.  I could understand if they were paying for my minibar.  Yeah, then there'd be a problem.  So, we just want to let Cleveland know. 
[00:07:00]  We should have been there today, and we'll do better next time.  I don't know what to tell you.  We'll do better next time.  We'll figure something out, okay?  We'll do better next time.  But, you know, say hi to Jim Norton for us, and have a good time.  You're going to have a ball if you're going to the Norton Show tonight.  Yeah, you're seeing this show, you'll laugh your ass off.  Very, very funny.  By the way, Tiger Woods' new girlfriend?  Yeah.  On the cover of the post.  Tell me I didn't nail that one yesterday.  Oh, I wish I nailed that one yesterday, but...  A color picture. 
[00:07:30]  No, no, I didn't say colored picture.  Jesus.  A color picture of a tiger and then his lovely girlfriend right there.  And we got great pictures of Tiger Woods' girlfriend up on foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Kevin needs to vent, so let's...  Oh, they're opposite again, I think.  Hold on, let me see.  Oh, no.  Yeah, they're opposite again.  Oh, no.  Hey, Kevin, what's going on?  Oh, hey, how you guys doing, man?  All right. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, this sucks.  Why?  I came home last night.  Found my wife with another guy.  Playing my Xbox.  Hey, hey.  Oh, no, guys, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  I didn't mean the...  King curse?  What do I...  I'm sorry about that, guys.  What do I do?  What do you think I should do?  And how does a guy F and play Xbox at the same time?  Oh, I'm joking.  I came home.  You're already playing...  You're already playing Xbox if, you know, you're banging your chair.  Basically.  What upset you more?  What upset you more? 
[00:08:30]  What do I do, you know?  Dude, I think that you're a phony.  Yeah, you don't sound real, dude.  Stop it.  Yeah, but you guys rule, though.  I love you guys.  Yeah.  But this is how you...  Didn't work.  Sorry.  I didn't work.  But guys, do me a favor.  Buy Xbox.  Buy it.  Xbox?  Well, Xbox does have better graphics.  Dude, I walked in and you got me checked to another guy.  Hey, play my Xbox.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:09:00]  What's going on, bro?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, hey, man.  I just wanted to thank you guys.  It's going to take me another goddamn year to get that insect song out of my head.  Ah, retard singing.  Yeah, we love the insect song.  Ah, Garrett rules.  Hi, bro.  Any retard singing, always funny.  Always funny.  Yeah.  Anthony, I guess we've got to start the show by talking about another suicide bombing.  Yeah, this is great.  And I, we're watching the footage on TV.  What's the latest one?  Another girl or woman?  Some girl.  Well, yeah.  Now the girls are getting into it over there in Israel. 
[00:09:30]  The Palestinian girls, they're strapping bombs to themselves and blowing up, blowing people up.  Six people dead.  I think, what, 50 injured or something like that?  50 injured.  At another bus stop.  Bus stops.  But they wouldn't let this girl on the bus, I guess?  No, they stopped her before she was ready to get on the bus.  And then, you know, whenever they get stopped, they explode themselves, trying to take out as many people as they can.  When they get on the buses, that's what happened, I guess, a few days ago.  Yeah.  They got on a bus and really tore it up. 
[00:10:00]  Well, the observation Ant and I made in the back office, at this point, why would you ever travel on a bus?  Yeah.  Why would you be at a bus stop?  Why would you be anywhere there is more than two people?  Right.  They're looking for crowds of people.  So we're watching, and I'm just saying to myself, wouldn't you just walk down the middle of a street,  and if another person came up to you, just go, get away, get away.  I don't want a crowd around me.  I don't want anything.  I would wear one of those magnet suits, so it kind of just pushes everyone away from me. 
[00:10:30]  Push people away.  You can't have people near you.  You can't be in a crowd.  They're blowing themselves up in crowds of people.  It's very tragic over there, but at this point, I don't understand the mentality of the people.  I don't know how you live your life in that situation.  I mean, could you imagine, you know, we saw what happened on 9-11.  Could you imagine if that was going on every week or so?  Like, every week or so, something was happening around the city that was killing a lot of people at one point.  How about this?  Every week, there's a plane going into a building. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Who in their right mind is going to be working in a building?  You're going to work up on the upper floors of a building?  It's like, I don't get it.  People are getting on buses.  They're going out.  I would lock myself.  Get a scooter.  Yeah.  They love those scooters when you get out of the United States.  You get yourself a scooter.  I haven't heard of one person being blown up on a scooter.  Get one of those scooters and, you know, drive yourself to work.  Why are you getting on a bus?  Why are you going to these malls?  Why are you going to these restaurants?  I guess they feel they've got to live their life.  But how do you live your life in that situation? 
[00:11:30]  You slow down a little bit and realize, you know, this is happening a lot, so you've got to adjust your lifestyle for a little while.  And hope that it gets all worked out.  I don't know if anybody, because we've gotten a few emails.  Do you want a quick opinion on this one?  I think George Bush is being stupid, and he is being a hypocrite.  They have a huge demonstration down in Times Square today.  A bunch of Palestinians out there saying that Israel should pull out.  Israel should go balls out and kill every one of these terrorists. 
[00:12:00]  And George W. saying that Israel should pull out of these cities.  You see what they're getting when they go into these cities?  They go into these Palestinian cities, and they confiscate hundreds of weapons and bomb-making stuff.  Who's saying they shouldn't be able to do this?  If something similar...  And truckloads of rocks.  Yeah, then the rocks they love to throw.  Those laser-guided rocks.  I'm surprised there's any rocks laying around at this point.  Why on earth would our president tell Israel to stop weeding these people out? 
[00:12:30]  I don't understand it.  If people were walking in and blowing up clubs in a major city in New York and bus stops and whatnot,  you would have the army invading places that they believe these people are making the bombs in.  Right?  If you knew it was right...  You know, let's say it was right across the Mexican border.  There's all these places.  Do you think we'd roll tanks into Mexico and blow the hell out of them?  Of course we would. 
[00:13:00]  So why is it any different?  Why the hell shouldn't they be allowed to blow these people up?  Well, I'll tell you why.  Because George W. Bush and everyone else is so worried about what the hell these towel-headed monkeys are going to think  if we completely stand behind Israel.  So he's on the fence.  He's trying to play both sides of it.  And he comes off looking like a complete hypocrite.  He's got this big war on terrorism, but he won't allow Israel to fight his own war on terrorism. 
[00:13:30]  Ridiculous.  Ridiculous!  10-year-old kids blowing up people.  There's no way you're going to talk.  There's no bargaining with people like this.  If Israel pulls out, the Palestinians are going to hate them anyway.  They're not going to go, oh, they pulled out.  Let's like them now.  No, they're still going to run into bus stops and blow people up.  There's one way to weed them out.  And that's to kill them.  To kill them.  They're animals.  They only understand death.  Thank you.  So that's the official Anthony viewpoint on this whole thing.  There's the Sean Hannity portion of the show. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  Awful.  Ron, four hours of that.  Four hours.  I know.  You sum it up in three minutes.  You sum it up in three minutes and you move on to the T&A.  Yeah.  That's right.  Hey, guys, Rock, I'm here in Cleveland.  I guess I'm going to have to go over and write a check so I can see you guys to bring you down here.  Yeah, maybe Cleveland should have had a fundraiser to bring us to town.  Oh, fun.  How pathetic is that?  Jeez, Marty, I want to see you guys.  You guys rock.  We love you here in Cleveland.  Norton, you rule.  It could have been funny if we just had all our listeners in Cleveland just stop by the station with their pennies. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Have one of those fundraisers and if they collect enough pennies, then we get to come to town and support Jim Norton tonight.  In little orange UNICEF boxes.  Right.  Walk around, maybe hold a carnival in their backyard.  We should have been there.  Yeah, that's what we need is a carnival.  We should have been there and we feel guilty today.  Hey, next time I go by a station, I'm going to throw my roll of pennies out.  That's a good idea.  Take your pennies down to the station so they can pay for us next time.  Yeah.  Sorry, bro.  Derek, what's going on? 
[00:15:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was just wondering if you didn't get down to Cleveland because they couldn't get that tub full of crap for you set up.  Stinky's tub full of crap?  That he went into his hotel room in Boston.  Oh.  And he had a tub full of feces.  What happened?  Cleveland couldn't put it together for you?  Dan, do you know?  I mean, is there an official answer?  What happened?  It all did come down to money.  What did we ask for?  Half the problem is the program director, she just had a baby. 
[00:15:30]  So she's out of town.  Yeah, congrats to Kim Monroe.  And the general manager's out of town.  Oh, my God.  It sounds like silly domestic issues.  No, there was an original problem with we put together a rider of what we needed.  And when you think about it, when we go to Philly in Boston, for one second, when we do go to Philly in Boston, everyone drives.  Hey, guys.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Which is a big expense to some of these smaller stations.  So that's...  Go get the rider.  Do we have the rider?  I have the rider.  Please get the rider, Ben.  Let's get the rider.  Please get the rider.  I want...  Because I don't even know what this show demands when it goes on the road. 
[00:16:00]  I am the Anthony portion of the Opie and Anthony show.  I have no clue what this show needs to go to another city.  They decided to put a little list together.  I can't wait to see it.  Also, we're rock stars.  Yes, Derek.  Rock stars.  Go ahead, Derek.  I knew it.  I was just ready to go.  No, it ain't going to work.  We'll go to Trucker Jay as Ben gets the rider.  Hey, Jay, you calling from California?  You bet.  All right.  What's up?  It says, I always have a lot to say. 
[00:16:30]  Well, I'm a long-winded truck driver, don't you know?  And it's a pleasure to be speaking to Opie and Anthony on WNEW's greatest station in the world.  All right.  You know, I was first little lick-ass last night while I was rolling through Sacramento.  And it sure was amazing that he kicked off Flash Friday.  Anyway, in a big way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to talk about WOW.  I drive a company truck, so I can't put a bumper sticker on.  But I have a huge WOW written on the back of my tank. 
[00:17:00]  And I'd like to say it all you say.  All right.  Great.  Hey, Paul Mercurio.  Hey.  What's up, bro?  You're live on the air, Paul.  Oh, I am.  Yes, Paul.  Watch what you say.  You're live on the air.  I'm honored.  Why would Paul be calling Rick?  I don't get that one.  Interesting.  I thought Paul was on our show yesterday.  Yeah.  Why would he have to call Rick so soon after his appearance?  I don't know.  How was Rascals last night?  Rascals was awesome.  They were a nice crowd.  There were five women up front who wouldn't stop talking.  And I had to snap on them like four different times. 
[00:17:30]  Did you wish any of them a barren woman?  Yeah, where's that clip?  No, I actually took care of her with a coat hanger later.  A coat hanger?  And a broken Heineken bottle.  Oh, that's great.  And you're playing Rascals Saturday and Sunday, right?  Yes, I am.  In West Orange?  No, in Ocean Township.  Oh, now I screwed up everybody.  Now you screwed it up, see?  Because now no one's going to really know.  Rascals Ocean Township with Paul Mercurio Saturday and Sunday.  Headlining the big shows.  Go down there, especially if you have a pregnant wife, because it's so funny when Paul wishes 
[00:18:00]  stillbirth on your child.  It's great.  And then he punches your pregnant wife in the belly.  I did have one of these women down front at one point say to me, in the middle of my  act, you yell at us a lot.  She literally was like, she scrunched up her nose.  She's like this adorable, like 26-year-old blonde.  And she goes, you yell at us a lot.  And there's, well, her friend, like in the middle of my act, was asking me questions about 
[00:18:30]  other parts of my act.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  So how long have you been married to your wife?  She's literally conducting a conversation with me while I'm doing my act for 300 people.  Great.  So she's dead in the trunk of my car.  Anyway.  Yeah.  No, it was fun.  They were a good crowd.  They were a little rowdy, but that's okay.  Cool.  All right, hold on.  We got the clip now.  All right.  This is actually Paul Mercurio warming up the Daily Show audience.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren.  Listen to me, you yell, barren.  Now, you would think, wow, he's an edgy comic and that's part of his routine. 
[00:19:00]  No, he was yelling at an audience member.  That's what he had to say to her.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't it sound like you just grabbed it from an argument he was having in some relationship  in his life?  You know, it's like you had a tape recorder in my bedroom with my wife.  You ever pull that one out during an argument?  My father always said, never go to bed angry, but if you do go to bed angry with your wife,  give her that line before you go to bed. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that'll do it.  That'll give her something to think about.  Well, it's that or you hit her with a bag of oranges because they don't leave bruises.  Yeah, whatever works.  I heard a phone book.  That was Ike Turner's favorite.  Yeah, those are good.  But Manhattan, it's a little unruly with the Manhattan phone book.  He'd hit Tina in the body with phone books so he wouldn't bruise up her face so she could  still go out and sing like a good pimp.  How great is that?  Also, he used to whip her ass, not her lower ass because she'd wear the short skirts, her  upper ass and back with a car antenna. 
[00:20:00]  He'd take a car antenna out and then whap, whap, hit her with the phone book in the ribs  and tell that bitch to go out there and earn him some money.  He was going into Radio Shack like every other day for antennas.  For new antennas.  What are you doing with these antennas?  Ah, it's in the car wash.  Shut up.  Give me another antenna.  Shut up, mother.  I'm going to beat you.  And then he does the worst thing of all.  He yelled at Tina that he hopes her womb is barren.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren.  All right, Paul.  We're going to put you on hold for rest. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  All right, man.  I'll see you guys.  Talk to you later.  I have no idea why Paul's calling.  Maybe we'll find out a little later, Anthony.  Yeah, who knows.  All right, let's go to Cleveland and say hi to Foz.  Remember, we remember Foz from the Naughty Nighty contest.  Sure.  Foz, what's going on, bro?  What's up, man?  Hey.  You tell us.  I was out doing some stuff for the morning show this morning, handing out WOW stickers,  and a nice little woman's group came up to me and spit on me.  Oh, that's great.  And they also informed us that they are going to try to ban WOW in Cleveland and try to get 
[00:21:00]  you guys off the air.  Good luck, twats.  They're just going to make us bigger, those idiots.  Yep.  They don't get it.  They don't understand that.  They don't get it.  It was a beautiful thing, man.  They ripped me a new one for passing out WOW stickers, saying it was the most disgusting  thing that they've ever heard about in their entire life and went on for about 15 minutes.  You know, if they were talking to me, it would have went on for 10 seconds.  Yeah.  Why did you sit there and listen to that for 15 minutes?  Oh, I tried to talk to them and say, you know, look, it's a radio promotion.  These guys are great guys.  They're hugely loved in Cleveland, but they're like, no, it's disgusting and blah, blah, 
[00:21:30]  blah.  And they were just two big, fat, ugly pigs and no one wanted to see their cans anyway.  Well, that's what you know something.  Ninety nine percent of the women that make up these goddamn groups are just slobs.  They are women that got no attention from men during their lives and not only from their  looks.  I mean, you could overcome your looks with personality, but they have horrid personalities.  They look like monsters and they didn't get attention from men. 
[00:22:00]  So they figure they advocate a hatred of men and men that appreciate the beautiful form  of a woman.  And they spit on people that hand out wow stickers.  That's that's great.  And then, Foz, how are you guys giving out the wow stickers there?  Oh, we're doing we're giving out mad wow stickers.  There are going to be a bunch of them at the Norton show tonight.  So there should be plenty of good looking breasts flashed at Norton tonight.  All right.  Right on.  Thanks, Foz.  No problem, dude.  Later.  All right.  Peace.  And if your radio station isn't handing out the wow stickers, because not all the stations 
[00:22:30]  we're on are handing out the wow stickers.  Right.  You send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us in New York.  We'll give you the New York version.  All right.  Yes.  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  And that address is on the opieandantony.com website.  Yes, it is.  So we're waiting for Ben to come down the hall with the rider.  It was the rider.  We might have to take a break and we'll read the rider.  Because we should have been in Cleveland today.  I know.  We're not bitching at the station.  I guess something we couldn't work it out, unfortunately. 
[00:23:00]  We'll go to the FU line.  Maybe we're just too expensive.  Maybe we're just too expensive.  I'm a little scared.  I think there's going to be some crazy things on that rider.  I hope it don't make us look too bad.  What are we demanding that a station can afford it?  I don't know.  But the listener is already an infinity broadcasting station.  The listener is already guessing what is on the opie and Anthony rider.  Yeah.  To get us to other cities.  Yes, Len.  Yeah.  I want to know if your rider asked for a single bowl of only brown M&Ms.  No, that's Van Halen.  Van Halen, man.  Yeah, that's Van Halen. 
[00:23:30]  Actually, a pack of cigarettes on every flat surface of the dressing room.  That was another one, wasn't it?  Yeah.  A pack of Marlboro on every flat surface.  All right.  We'll be back.  This is the FU line.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the opie and Anthony FU line.  Yeah, I like to give a big FU to the street vendors on Broadway right outside the Liberty Plaza.  One of the Plaza who are selling pictures of the World Trade Center on fire and collapsing.  FU, you sea-sucking F.  I hope you all get a double dose of ass cancer and AIDS.  And to the tourists that are buying the pictures, do us an effing favor and stay to F home. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  If that's what you're going to spend your money on, we don't need your effing business in our effing city.  So go back to effing Missouri and go F your mothers.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send out a big FU to tell them for effing with me.  Do you want to f*** with me, huh?  We'll bring it on, Marlboro.  You have F with a long bitch.  So you know what?  F you, jeep.  Next message.  Yeah, I like to give a big f*** to you to my girlfriend for always bitching at me for looking at porn on the Internet.  If you were holding up your end of the f***ing deal, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. 
[00:24:30]  So shove it up your ass, bitch, and crush your f***ing teeth, too.  Next message.  Hey, this FU goes out to the city of Buffalo and it's hockey team to savers.  Who didn't make the playoffs?  Just like their ex-goal fader, Dominic Ajax said.  Hey, Buffalo, you lost six players.  Nineteen million dollars in money you could have lost back in your team.  And you stupid GM Regeer gets Bob Corko at the end of the trade deadline.  You people suck.  You bunch of losers.  You'll renew your tickets because you're all psyched that, oh, they had a good run at the end, but they didn't make it. 
[00:25:00]  So I'm going to put $50,000 in their pocket again.  You're such a bunch of f***ing losers.  You're such a good idea that your team is crap.  They couldn't beat the lowly Atlanta Frasher.  And with Detroit with the cup, you people are going to eat so much pearl it's going to come out of your ass.  Ah!  Hey, this is Christian, by the way.  FU, Buffalo.  Well, end of message.  Opie and Anthony.  At the last supper, they would have wiped their asses with the tablecloth.  That's just what Christ wanted.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:25:30]  Is this for Sean Packer?  Hang up on this picture.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Friday version.  Ernie O. from New Jersey checking in on the instant feedback.  Hey, guys, I'm emailing you from my computer on top of Mount Everest where I called my wife doing another guy while he was playing my Xbox.  Thank you, Ernie O.  Where is Mount Everest guy?  He hasn't checked in from India yet. 
[00:26:00]  At the base camp.  He might be finally giving up on his little thing.  You think he did?  Yep.  All right, we got the rider in front of us, Anthony.  And quite frankly, it's not that bad.  It's not all that bad.  People are trying to guess what's on the Opie and Anthony rider.  Oh, yeah.  To have us come to your town to broadcast live.  Dan from Hoboken.  I don't blame Cleveland for turning ONA away, considering Anthony insists that he have two of everything that normal people only need one of.  Yeah, that must be it. 
[00:26:30]  Kevin from Philly.  Hey, I know what, uh, I know what is on, I know what is on one of the things on your list.  Is it number one?  Wow, dude.  Here's, oh.  Oh.  But he can't, right?  Yeah, there's too many is's in this.  He thinks one of the items on our rider is a mom breastfeeding her almost four-year-old son.  Oh.  But he went a long way to say that.  Mommy.  Mama, I want to mini. 
[00:27:00]  Bobby from Queens.  Here's a list of things that will not be on the Opie and Anthony rider.  Fresh blueberries, dark sunglasses, a big fat cowboy hat, and a bathtub full of crap.  Very nice.  Yeah.  And Jim from Cleveland, did you guys ask for an Emo Phillips CD in your rider?  Nice.  Uh, did you miss your Emo reference yesterday?  Uh, yeah, I think so.  Rick was going to say it, and you said, no, no, I'll take care of that, and then you forgot.  Yeah, I blew it.  So that's over. 
[00:27:30]  That cute little thing is over.  I was hoping to drag that along for another three days.  Uh, Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show, the, uh, the Market Visit Rider, it's called.  Market Visit Rider.  This is the reason why we're not broadcasting from Cleveland today.  Our demands were, were too great.  Yeah.  You want to read it?  Go ahead.  Well, um, scheduling the date of the broadcast appearance.  All related travel will be mutually agreed upon ahead of time in writing.  All right.  That sounds easy enough.  Personnel. 
[00:28:00]  The following personnel travel with the show.  Adjust for a specific event.  So who, who is, uh, involved with the show?  Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia.  I guess that's Opie and Anthony.  They have to be there.  Yeah.  I guess we have to make it official.  The Greg and Tony show.  Yeah.  The Gregory and Anthony show.  Gregory and Anthony.  Ugh.  Ah.  Hate both of my names.  Hughes and Cumia. 
[00:28:30]  The Hughes and Cumia show.  There you go.  Nice.  I like that.  When we go all political talk.  Cumia and Hughes.  Gotta see which flows better.  One of us is on the right, one's on the left, and we fight all day.  I wear a beret, and Jim's on his knees.  Well, third person on the list, Jim Norton.  He's gotta be there.  Rick.  Ben.  Garrett.  Awesome Garrett made the list.  No awesome in front of his name?  No, this is an official list, Anthony.  Jeremy.  Yep.  If needed. 
[00:29:00]  Well, then he should never go.  Yeah, man.  If needed.  We could have taken four people off this list, and that would have saved a lot of money,  and we would be broadcasting from Cleveland today.  Nice enough guy and all, but I mean, is he really needed on these excursions?  We don't need Jeremy.  No.  Ethel.  Ethel.  Hey, Ethel.  Ethel, if needed.  She helped us out in New Orleans.  Yeah, she did.  She was very helpful in New Orleans.  Uh, Steve? 
[00:29:30]  Steve Carlisi?  Yeah.  From foundrymusic.com?  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Steve C., that would be.  Steve C.?  Well, he's gotta, you know, film everything for the website.  That's true.  Steve is very needed.  He works, uh, he's multifaceted.  He's video.  Steve is needed because he's the only one that can keep up with Ben when we're in other cities.  And he's a big enough guy that, uh, he could, uh, kick some ass.  There you go.  If, uh, need be.  And an engineer, if needed.  Pete Johnson, I'm going on your road show.  One of your trips.  It'll be like vaudeville. 
[00:30:00]  Vaudeville.  Yes, uh, Ben?  Oh, hold on, hold on.  After our New Orleans visit, this is, this is half the reason this whole rider came about.  Uh-oh.  Because of the engineers that just, you know.  Oh, the drunk engineers.  That we saw with that.  The same song we just played coming out of break and had everything all messed up.  So from now on, we have to have it.  And for 20 minutes, you heard it and I going, well, did you try, like, uh, pushing that or turning that up?  Why aren't we on here?  Hey, welcome back to New Orleans.  Oh, we're not on?  No, okay.  We're not on.  Mother Eppers.  What's wrong, man?  We did a good broadcast. 
[00:30:30]  For 20 minutes.  Yeah.  Turned out it was one stupid button they didn't have pushed down.  No, they had it pushed down.  But the engineer, during Seek and Destroy, he was so drunk, he got up and started dancing and kicked the board and the button popped.  Was that before or after the owner of the fine stations down there in New Orleans decided to lick Jim Norton's bald head?  Jim Norton.  And this isn't even, how do you know, I don't do it.  Jim Norton will never go to New Orleans because of the owner of the radio station, who's a really nice guy. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  But the guy, the owner, the owner, just imagine Mel coming in here one day and licking Jim's head.  Ain't going to happen.  Never.  Ain't going to happen.  Because there's another broadcast company that went on, you know?  And so Jim's sitting there, tired and stuff.  The guy decided he needed to lick Jim Norton's bald head.  Jim cocked back and was going to punch him in the face.  Oh, I know.  Because then he licked his head and then put him in one of those, uh, what? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, kind of like a headlock thing and was like pushing him down toward the ground.  Oh, my God.  They were so friggin' hammered.  And then Tom offering, uh, swapping partners with Rick.  Hey, we all go down to my hot tub.  I got a hot tub all full of water.  We could go down there and get some bubbles on us and drink some and maybe swap wives.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Rick.  We're going to go back to our house.  We got a hot tub, baby. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We got a hot tub, baby.  No one should ever say baby to another guy.  It's going to be great, baby, love.  Right.  Pull down your pants.  Let me see your sack.  Hey, Andy, what's up, baby?  What's up, baby?  I've never seen that.  Who says that?  My wife and Rick's wife are hitting it off pretty good.  Look at them on the couch.  Oh, God.  Yeah, look at them on the couch now.  How y'all doing?  So the reason we have this rider is because of the New Orleans trip, I guess.  Rick, the girls are going at it.  What do you say?  I put my hands down your pants. 
[00:32:30]  See what's working down there.  I want to do some licking myself.  Yeah, that's how we're doing in New Orleans.  Don't mean we're gay.  It means we're drunk and going to regret this in the morning.  It's not gay if you're too drunk to remember.  It ain't gay if two men are having sex watching their wives go at it.  Is it?  I guess it is.  What do I know?  Give me another beer.  Don't worry.  The clothes ride up.  So that's why we have this rider now, because of good old Tom. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So I have the names on that list.  It didn't even have to go with us.  Uh-huh.  All right, go ahead.  So then it goes to the travel portion of the rider, Anthony.  Yes, travel.  Air.  Nonstop coach flights from LaGuardia, JFK, or Newark, prepaid by your station.  So we need airfare.  Here lies the problem.  And we need a ride from the airport from a guy that is not drunk and not the PD of the station. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  How you guys doing?  That was the first thing he said to us.  He's standing by the baggage carousel.  Now, he's got a cooler in him.  We've been flying all night.  And he's holding one of those big goddamn hurricanes or tycoons, whatever the hell they call it.  He's got a wacky shirt on and stayed in the room with the crap-filled pants.  They bunked.  I was hearing stories of pillow fights.  Was there a pillow fight on Saturday? 
[00:34:00]  Mary, was there a pillow fight?  Grandpa Ben's mic over there.  Was there a pillow fight?  I heard there was a pillow fight.  It wasn't a pillow fight per se.  I was on the phone and I got smashed in the face with a pillow.  With a pillow.  All right.  That's not two pillows.  During the time?  Did he get to ask him?  Did he get to see us?  By myself, yes.  Yeah, okay.  But did he get to see your awesome Garrett walk out of the bathroom with just a towel on?  No, he was awesome.  Hi.  Hi.  He had special rules.  Did you see him walking out with like a martini glass in his hand? 
[00:34:30]  Hi.  I'm awesome, Garrett.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  It's awesome, stinky Garrett.  Hi.  Hi, Mary.  Hi.  I left you some hot water.  Let me tell you a little something about the colonnade also, Mary.  Tell you a little something about the colonnade.  I really like to have baths up still.  The colonnade.  Have you been, you know the bathroom doors of the colonnade, right?  A little strange, aren't they?  Yes.  Yes.  What are they?  They're huge.  They're double doors. 
[00:35:00]  It's not a regular door that closes like a door, right?  It's double doors where there's a space between the door of about a quarter inch.  Stinky?  You didn't have that there.  You didn't have those double doors.  I know that's a special bathroom for the $100 million dollar guy.  Did you have that one?  Yeah, that must be it.  It's like a separated sink and shower.  Like the shower and the toilet.  Oh, great.  I was thinking because there's a perfect peep opportunity with the, oh, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  No, we had rules.  We had a little section if you sat at a certain point in the room where you couldn't see anywhere in the bathroom.  It was on the same side of the room, so whenever one of us was coming out, we'd yell at him and we'd sit.  Did you, now, when you came out of the bathroom, were you completely dressed?  Uh, wait, can I say that again?  Were you completely dressed when you came out of the bathroom?  Like you brought?  When you did or when I?  No, when you did.  You shower.  No, I would come out in a towel.  Now, do you come out in a towel?  Like a towel, yeah.  Whoa!  All right.  Hey!  Woo!  Yeah!  That was awesome. 
[00:36:00]  Hi!  Hi!  I'm thinking...  Stinky puts on the colonnade robe with an ascot and a pipe.  Hi!  Hi, Mary.  You're going to learn a whole new side of awesome Garrett.  They don't call me awesome for nothing.  Puts on a little mood music and...  Yeah?  Did awesome Garrett come out with just a towel?  No, he was kind of dressed.  He was more shy than I was.  Was that, oh, you were more shy than Mary when you shared quarters? 
[00:36:30]  You weren't checking me out.  You got to earn that.  I tried to get him to show me stuff, but he wouldn't.  Like what?  You're junk?  She tried to get you to...  What do you want to see?  What do you want to see, Mary?  I don't know anything.  I don't see...  I've never seen lots of boys, so, you know.  So, you want to see one?  Ah!  Good work, too!  You are awesome!  Awesome, Garrett!  You are awesome!  Making a deal, you know?  You might have to...  What's the point? 
[00:37:00]  The thing is, awesome Garrett has morals.  I love it.  No, no, it's not...  It's not morals.  He was working something.  No, and he took a risk.  No, it's morals the other way.  That's what I'm saying.  That did not pay off.  Now, let me tell you something.  You, if you had some confidence in what you had, showing her might have closed the deal.  Yeah!  Like, you got to show the good thing.  And it's like, all right, look, she can't resist that.  You know, it is truly awesome.  And then, you know, but not saying, you know, only if we're doing something, then I'll show you.  But that's like, you're just at the point where it is at maximum volume without looking like 
[00:37:30]  it's heading in the direction of ready to go.  And then you go, I'm having a little shrinkage.  I hope this isn't too embarrassing.  And then she's looking like, oh my God, what is it like, Phillip?  And, you know, just out of the shower, there's a little shrinkage here.  It's only this big.  Then you want to gasp, and that's fun.  I would have worked my gag.  I would have worked my stuff, but I got high.  But I got high.  High.  I was going to peep on Mary, but I got high. 
[00:38:00]  So, let me see yours, and I'll show you mine.  Did you ask that?  Yeah, I tried that.  And that didn't work?  Mary, why wouldn't you reciprocate?  A little trade.  I can't just be like, bam, look.  I just didn't, you know, I'm a little self-conscious, I guess.  Yeah?  What if he would have showed you first?  Then would you have reciprocated with it?  Possibly, because I would have been laughing so hard.  I would have been being embarrassed.  God, I hate girls that laugh.  No, you know, I'm still young. 
[00:38:30]  You've got to know when not to laugh.  Audio from Mary in the hotel.  We got it.  She sounds a little confused.  I don't know.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  No, it would have been so awesome, I would have been shocked.  So, you know.  I would have said, what are we going to do about this?  But I got high.  But I got high.  High.  All right.  I would have dropped my towel out of the shower, but I got high.  High.  High. 
[00:39:00]  Here's Stinky leaving the hotel room, bragging about nothing.  She was the greatest piece of ass I ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  All right, back to this rider, Anthony.  Here's Mary when Stinky offered some sex.  Wow.  She ran out of that.  Well, thank you.  I love this little friggin' general hospital sofa for you to present us with on a daily basis.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:30]  Jeez.  Awesome blackie.  All right, what else is on this list here?  It's like watching Moonlighting or whatever the hell that show was.  Oh, it's so nice.  Ooh, when's it going to happen?  He's like singing 60s tunes, but he's high and everything.  But I'm high.  All right.  Let's see.  Car.  Adjusted for a specific event.  Rental cars or car service.  Prepaid.  Direct bill to your station.  You know what? 
[00:40:00]  Cha-ching.  Did anyone talk to Cleveland and say we can work on this list?  We usually get picked up by a station van.  Hey, God, no.  Yeah, we don't need, like.  I mean, New Orleans went all out and they got us a limo with a drunk PD that was offering us Coke.  But, oh, and the pot smoke.  And blowing it in Norton's face.  I'm an addict, you idiot.  That's what he said.  It was classic.  Like, Tom is one of those guys who just thinks it's a ball.  Everything's a ball and no one's got any problems because he just pushes his all down. 
[00:40:30]  So he's just like, yeah, smoke.  Like blowing pot smoke in Jim's face.  And Jim, yeah, he's an addict.  You know, he's got an addictive personality.  He kicked all the habits.  Long time ago.  Long time ago.  So to have that done, he just finally snapped and went, I'm an addict, you idiot.  Hey, what do I know?  How you all doing?  Oh, what are you now?  You want me to stop off and get you some heroin then?  What do you mean?  I am too, but my excuse is Mardi Gras. 
[00:41:00]  Mardi Gras.  I don't need this beer.  I just choose to have it all the time.  Let's see.  Agenda.  The agenda of the visit mutually agreed upon ahead of time in writing to possibly include  client and staff meet and greets.  See, that's bad for us.  We ought to take this out.  Technical.  We need access to broadcast studio.  Availability to set up an hour before airtime.  Three mics.  Two CD players. 
[00:41:30]  A computer in the studio with internet access.  High-speed internet access for two laptops.  Jacks.  Yeah, technical stuff to do a show.  Right.  All that stuff.  Easy, because every station has that.  It doesn't really cost them money.  Let's see.  Backstage dressing room area.  Oh, this is for the road show.  Right.  Road show.  Backstage dressing room area for ten people that is private and secure.  We've never gotten that.  The VIP area turns into a mass room.  It's crazy.  Backstage green room area for 40 VIPs. 
[00:42:00]  Security staff with passes for two areas.  Catering backstage, including dinner for the O&A crew.  Dinner.  Dinner.  If we have one of those big heroes from a place, you know, a big sandwich or something,  we're lucky.  Most of the time, I don't eat at all.  I wake up in the morning hungover going, I should eat.  Full staging audio lighting production.  Previously negotiated system for filling a house.  I guess that's more technical crap for tickets and whatnot. 
[00:42:30]  Opie needs a healthy meal for lunch.  No, I don't.  I do like eating.  Has that been negotiated on?  A healthy meal for lunch?  Well, every time I go to Boston, I'm like, dude, can you help me out?  I need to eat something healthy.  That's it.  Yogurt and great beef.  Easy.  What?  It's healthy.  Norton needs a iced latte from Starbucks only.  Only from Starbucks.  And Anthony needs ten cases of beer.  Ten cases of beer.  Come on, that's for everybody. 
[00:43:00]  That's so everyone doesn't drink my beer.  There's really not much on the list.  No.  I'm kind of disappointed.  Yeah.  I'm thinking we should add some ridiculous stuff in to see if they do it.  Stuff that might not cost money but is a pain in the ass.  All right, Ant.  We'll start being prima donnas.  All right.  Well, you know, we want to go to Washington when Norton's there.  Possibly Buffalo when Norton's there.  Washington could be a drive, though.  Washington is definitely happening because it's not a flight. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  Buffalo, though.  Yeah.  Could be driving there.  Anyone need a hairdresser?  Anthony, lots to do on the show today.  Someone to trim your body hair?  Anyone?  Anyone?  We have today's Wesley Willis song of the day on the way.  Yes.  We have a story about a man getting a finger transplant.  Yeah, this is sick.  Science gone too far.  It's our next parents' meeting we're having.  Did the guy really have junk cancer? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  He had cancer of the schlong.  I didn't see the story, so you're going to have to explain for me.  And then he lost his junk, so they replaced it with a finger?  Yeah.  All right.  You'll have the story next?  Oh, yes.  Investigative report.  And Anthony, it seems like the priests are having more sex than Oz.  More sex than porno movies, more sex than Oz.  The latest one in New York, a guy fathered a child.  Yeah.  A priest had sex with one of the girls that worked at the church, wasn't it? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  One of those girls.  She was at the church for some capacity, you know, some religious thing.  And she was getting boffed by a priest.  She got pregnant, had the kid, because I guess abortion's a sin.  And hanging the priest is fine.  And now she's got a daughter.  I bet you the priest was cursing God at that point.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh damn it.  Oh, sorry.  I can't believe this.  And what did they do to the guy?  They just sent him off to another church, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, they kind of swept it under the rug.  This is all coming out now.  All these priests are shaking.  Between Boston and New York, it's getting ridiculous.  Big cities, those have got the hottest boys in those towns.  That's why.  Ooh, college boys up in Boston.  The priests love it.  Oh, ow.  So, ow.  So, we're smelling bit today.  We're thinking, uh, body of me.  Amen.  Oh, we're thinking.  Close your eyes and stick out your tongue.  Ow.  Oh, God.  Uh, we're smelling bit today. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Monastery Oz.  Yes.  So, we'll see if we can get that together.  In the meantime, we'll go to the FU line again.  A lot of FUs coming in today.  Oh, oh.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  This is OJ from Jersey.  I'd like to send a big FU to the New York Rangers for not making the f***ing playoffs.  They suck.  Can't you play some f***ing defense next time?  You know, you score like over 200 f***ing goals.  You can't get to the goddamn playoffs because of the law. 
[00:46:00]  You can't beat the thrashers.  Thanks for nothing.  You suck.  In the playoffs, you're tired of waiting in five years.  Later.  Next message.  I want to leave a big f***ing FU for the secretary door downstairs who's always walking in the  hallways going clickety-clack, clickety-clack.  F*** you, you bitch.  Sit down and do your job and stop f***ing gossiping around the hallways.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Bob from Kenstock in New Jersey with a big FU going out to me. 
[00:46:30]  I was at the Dave Matthews concert last night.  It was a Wednesday.  A lot of young f***ies all over the place.  And did I have my wow sticker with me?  No.  What an ass.  So here, right to you, Bob.  A big f***ing F*** you.  End of message.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach, but you guys made me blow chokes.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible. 
[00:47:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a couple of ass wipes.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  If you're in New York, give us a call.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York.  866-277-4WOW.  By the way, today's the day we find out if we're saying bye-bye to another city. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  This could be the last time you're hearing us in one of the cities we broadcast to.  Ah.  We are supposed to get an answer at 5 o'clock today.  We better.  Quite frankly, it's not looking good for the boys.  We're waiting for Fred Flintstone to give us a call and tell us.  Fred Flintstone.  A guy in the company that looks exactly like Fred Flintstone. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, give him your decision, Fred.  So outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  Look who I stopped by to say hi.  Hi.  The mini-wheat.  The famous mini-wheat now.  Look at you.  How many mini-wheat commercials have you done?  Four.  Four?  Yeah.  They're on all the time now.  I signed a five-year deal with them.  A five-year deal with mini-wheats.  Yeah, something's going on because you're dressing better.  I know.  I always dress better.  It must pay well to be a mini-wheat. 
[00:48:30]  I'm doing all right.  The mini-wheat pays good.  Yeah, it pays good.  Look, I can tell.  Look at the suit.  Look at you.  I changed the deal.  Yeah, look at what the hell is going on.  The mini-wheat bucks are pouring.  Slow down.  You've had the same hairstyle since we met you four and a half years ago, man.  No, I was over here like this.  It's right there.  Oh, yeah.  Remember?  Okay.  All right.  Do you remember?  Remember when?  Sure.  Give us a line from the commercial.  Yeah, what's one of the lines?  Which one do you want to hit?  There's so many to choose from.  Yeah.  I feel like the how you're doing boys. 
[00:49:00]  Maybe one of the older commercials.  Because, you know.  One's hitchhiking.  One's in a hotel.  Yeah, the hitchhiking one.  The hitchhiking one.  Hey, wait.  Sorry, I'm out of practice.  Yeah, of course.  She's been cashing the checks.  Hey, wait.  You still awake back there?  See, that's the mini-wheat.  You know, I've been thinking.  Maybe we're wrong to make people choose size.  I'm sweet and delicious.  You're healthy and nutritious.  If we work together in harmony, we realize we're actually a pretty good dean. 
[00:49:30]  He's the mini-wheat guy.  The Frosted Pesci.  Frosted Pesci.  Frosted Pesci.  All the shows get Sylvester Stallone on the air.  We get the mini-wheat guy.  Hey, I guarantee.  I'd rather have the mini-wheat guy.  I guarantee every goddamn day you sit in front of the television and you see that friggin' commercial.  One of those goddamn mini-wheat commercials.  Hey, we got cable.  The hotel room one, sure.  That one I wrote.  Thank you very much.  Did you help write him? 
[00:50:00]  No, no, I did write that one.  So you're getting, like, a writer's paycheck there?  No, not on a regular thing.  It was just a...  But hey, Richie, you want him in a taxi cab.  I thought that was, like, boss material.  So I thought, I'm oinkin'.  I love Rich.  Very nice.  All right, mini-wheat guy.  Missed you guys, man.  Haven't seen you in a while.  And you've been busy.  And it's good to see you, too.  You've been busy.  That's a little sarcasm.  No, it's not.  Guy's always a prick to me.  No.  You are always wrong with me.  No, not.  Jesus Christ.  I don't mess with anyone that can do judo, bro. 
[00:50:30]  Look at the questions coming in.  Who plays the non-Frosted song?  Hey, good question.  Yeah.  Guy named Simon Bach.  What has he done?  He's from nothing.  Well, I mean, he does...  His first voice gig?  That's his real true voice.  Yeah.  How about that?  Amazing, ain't it?  It's a behind-the-music or the true Hollywood story of the mini-wheat.  That's it.  Then the frosted side went bad.  Why?  Why?  He turned to booze.  Why?  Is it frosted?  He turned to kicking people's ass out in front of Caroline's in the city. 
[00:51:00]  That's right.  You guys got passes now?  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's a high-security, this building.  Yeah, since 9-11.  Unbelievable.  They check people now.  That's good.  It's nuts in Times Square, man.  Yeah, they got a big protest going on down there.  Yeah, why are we involved with them?  Maybe because you people wear bombs like cummerbunds.  What are you doing, Rick?  Here we go again.  What does this say now?  Hey, Rick, what?  Am I going to say something bad about him?  Oh, that's messed up, man.  What?  What are you writing?  Rick wrote, frosted side turned to cheap cologne. 
[00:51:30]  It smells horrible.  What's your cologne, bro?  What do you wear?  High karate.  Are you a high karate guy?  I am not.  Are you a high karate?  No, I am not.  I am a high karate.  Are you polo sports?  No, I'm not.  I'm polo sports.  What are you wearing, man?  Brut.  You put a lot of it on, bro.  Well, that's because I, you know.  Why?  Well, I had a couple auditions.  I had two.  All right.  No, I did.  I had a, you know, I stunk.  I wanted, you know, I did.  I was sweating.  What, on the audition or? 
[00:52:00]  No, I did a thing with Saturday Night Live today, man.  Oh, what is that?  Yeah, really sick.  You're going to be on?  Well, my body is.  What?  This is what's really effed up.  It could be, it could be a wireless phone commercial.  Josh Payne calls me.  He goes, I want you to do a, he's, he, okay.  All right.  No.  Are you name dropping?  No, I'm just telling you.  Who's Josh?  It's nothing major.  He only hires extras.  But it's all right.  It's a start.  My foot's in a thaw.  Okay.  What part do you play?  It's easy.  Easy enough.  They're doing a skit, a hardball. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Like this cable thing.  Uh-huh.  And they're going to put Chris Kattan's head on my body, beating the hell out of Bin Laden.  Oh, there you go.  So your body's going to be on SNL.  Yeah, you'll see the judo tattoos, but not my head.  Hey, you want to make out?  Hey, you want to make out?  Did he want to make out with you?  No.  What are you going to wear?  He's little, man.  Of course he is.  No, he is really little.  What are you going to wear, though?  You mean, like, topless?  No, I have to tell you the story, because I'm, and I know I'm going to try that.  Oh, boy.  Don't make it too long.  No, it's not.  No, seriously.  No, it's good.  You're going to laugh. 
[00:53:00]  The guy called me.  He goes, I need you for a skit on, I thought he said, on SNL.  Yeah.  But he said, I need you to do a skit involving SNM.  So I had to wear leather pants and a leather vest with a collar on my neck.  Oh, boy.  But they don't show my head.  They're just using my body.  And, Rick, stop with the frickin' notes.  And that's what they're doing.  All right.  So it's going to be your body in SNM gear.  But I do, but I did read for a part next week, because Alex Baldwin's hosting. 
[00:53:30]  They might do something.  I might be doing something with him.  That's, like, pretty good.  All right.  That's, like, pretty good.  Yeah, I'm excited, man.  You know.  All right.  Things are looking up for you there, Jeff.  No deaf comedy jam like Boston, right?  Hey, I moved up to a feature rack now.  Oh.  I'm doing good.  You comics are hysterical.  And I don't mean that, like, on the stage.  No, that's come on.  No, I'm not saying.  Well, you guys wouldn't know, because you never come to my shows.  Oh, I went and saw you.  No, I know.  Just hand out all the stickers, and we'll pay you. 
[00:54:00]  Did that check ever come out yet?  That wasn't my biz.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  40,000 miles on my truck for a box of WOW stickers and spads.  Yeah, that's more than a lot of other people, guys.  You got a point.  And there was some kind of problem in your personal life, and that's why we couldn't hire you.  Yeah, well, I got this thing.  If you really want to get into it.  We can get into it.  We wanted to hire you, but the company wouldn't hire you because you had something going on  that wasn't too cool.  Yeah, I had a little physical altercation.  Is that taken care of?  Yeah, it's long done.  I mean, are you still hiring? 
[00:54:30]  Who'd you beat up?  The girl I was dating, her brother.  He didn't just punch him?  No.  Most normal guys, you know, you're pissed off, you punch someone in the face.  Don't make me sound violent.  Don't.  Because I'm doing good.  I don't want people to think I'm violent.  Right.  Well, this is in the past.  Right.  Why don't you explain what you did to your old girlfriend's brother?  I remember the first time you told me this, I was horrified.  Yeah, I was doing...  That was the day I said, I will never mess with this guy.  Oh, it took you that long? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  I was doing work at her.  I'm not going to mention any names, but I was doing work in a particular town, in a particular  state.  That's why I'm clear, okay?  And I did a bunch of work, and I winded up, I was doing a cement job, and I kneeled in  the cement, and the acid in the cement burnt all the skin off my legs.  I had fourth-degree burns on my legs.  Jesus.  Yeah, I was still...  I still scarred.  Let's take a look at it.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Holy God.  Yeah, that's why I don't compete as heavy as I did in judo, because of that. 
[00:55:30]  They still bleed.  And how long ago was this?  Three years ago.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Three years ago this happened, and you still have, like, scabs and stuff?  Well, because they want me to have...  I have to have one more skin graft, but I don't want to do it yet.  From acid in cement?  Yeah.  What happened was there was too much acid in the cement, okay?  Yeah.  And the ratio was, it's supposed to be so many for a yard.  You would know from construction.  You've got to know, just being Italian, it's your inbred, it's your inbred, you know.  You know cement being Italian. 
[00:56:00]  You don't have to measure.  Should I do it in cement?  So I ordered five yards of this freaking cement, okay?  No, I ordered five yards of the cement, and they put enough acid in it for the whole truckload.  And I kneeled in it, which was my mistake, you know.  But I was kneeling, trying to do this job for this freaking broad, and I went to stand, and I couldn't stand.  I couldn't get past, like, squatting position.  So I dropped my pants, and my legs were fizzing like peroxiline on a cuff.  Oh, my God.  Man, man.  That rocks.  That was rough.  Any lawsuits in your future about that? 
[00:56:30]  It's done.  Oh, it was taken care of?  Hence the nice new suit.  No, this is a mini-wheat jacket.  A mini-wheat jacket.  So how did this get to the guy that you cooked here?  Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.  So after all of a sudden was done, I was in the St. Barnabas burn unit for seven weeks, right?  Never hear nothing from the family.  Never come check me out.  Never come say help.  No card, no nothing, right?  So I find out she's bopping this dude at work the whole time. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I went to the house to confront her, and her sibling got in my face, and I says,  look, I need to talk.  I have a right to know it, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, this guy didn't know.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Wap, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  Oh, no, don't say that.  Oh, no.  Like, while that guy was saying that, you're watching the Godfather going,  oh, don't say that.  You don't know what you're in for.  No, he grabbed a pancake chisel out of the thing and threw it at me.  Right.  And it hit me in a leg, and then I just lost it.  And what did you do to him? 
[00:57:30]  And what happened?  Listen to this.  No, this is going to make me sound so evil.  This is four years ago.  And he threw a chisel at you.  Yeah, he deserved it.  I grabbed him, flipped him, threw him down, and put him in an arm thing,  and winded up breaking his arm and his shoulder.  And then I hit him, and I dislocated his jaw.  And then when I hit him, here, his eye socket thing up here got all messed up.  How did you crack his arm?  Remember the move I put on Psycho Mark in the back room, that arm bar? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  That.  And then it just, you heard it go, pshh.  No, it just went, pshh.  God damn.  And how long?  It wasn't a leg, just, pshh.  Just a little, pshh.  How long did all this take to accomplish?  Five seconds?  I don't know.  I was in a fit of rage.  Did he scream?  But the worst part is, I didn't even, I didn't even, yeah, he screamed.  Dude, did he scream?  Yeah.  What, like it snapped?  It went, pshh.  Wah!  Yeah.  And was he going, stop!  No, he just, I can't tell you what he's saying, but it was.  What was he saying?  He was just freaking, screaming, saying stuff. 
[00:58:30]  God damn.  Saying stuff.  It's like some guy that fell into the tiger pit at the zoo.  There's no talking to him.  It's just like, oh, oh, God, please.  Oh, no.  No, but.  Ah, pshh.  Oh, my God.  That's the only one provoked.  Right.  Of course.  He was hungry.  Would you start with the notes?  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  And then when he stood up, pshh, pshh.  That's what I did.  Wow.  So the guy then, I guess, had to be hospitalized. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  And then I just left.  Yeah.  Then I just left.  Yeah.  And I didn't do that.  You got lazy.  And I didn't know.  Next thing you know, cops are at the door.  Yeah, that'll happen.  It was a terrible thing.  Does he just freak out and go into, like, this freak out every time the mini-week commercial  comes on?  Can you imagine he's sitting there?  He's having cereal.  And down the front, it's hot.  Look at that psychotic laugh.  The mini-week's coming for me.  He has nightmares.  Oh, man.  Hey, you son of a... 
[00:59:30]  The mini-week...  I'm sweet and delicious and you're dead.  The frosted side's hitting me.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  The frosted side broke my arm and my jaw and my eye socket.  I loved how it just kept going, and, and, and, and, and his arm went, his shoulder, and  then something with his eye socket.  Wow.  I walk away from a lot of stuff, man.  Yeah.  I do.  When you were at Caroline's, if anyone's listening to Caroline's, call. 
[01:00:00]  Or Patrice, if you're listening, call.  You rerun fat prick.  But, um, at Carol, I walked away.  The guy who kicked you in the foot.  I walked away from him three times, and then I...  Well, that guy was just an ass.  Yeah.  I was like, dude, get the...  I go, get away from me, man.  But I'm not.  Get away from me.  The guy was like, I don't know what he was doing.  And he, he got down on the floor and started biting my ankle.  Biting my ankle.  That's really why I freaked.  I mean, he could say what he wants to me.  I was, you know...  I was like, get the F away from me. 
[01:00:30]  He was biting your ankle.  Yeah, I don't know what he was even doing.  He was so drunk.  He kicked him in the ankle.  And then he kicked me.  And then he went to grab it.  I'm like, what the, what the...  And then, uh, yeah, upstairs, when he was leaving the club, I guess.  Hey, the frosted side.  Kind of threw him in the air and let him hit the concrete.  It was pretty funny.  Take that, you frosted side.  All right.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  No, but it's good seeing you guys.  Yeah, it's good seeing you.  No, really.  I missed you, man.  I really did.  Oh, great, great white gorilla. 
[01:01:00]  Things are going good.  And I do have one announcement I want to make.  Yes?  No, this is good.  And I want to thank...  Oh, no.  Here comes the plug.  I'm turning green.  Who are you going to fight?  Who are you going to punch first?  Come on.  I'm trying to be serious with you.  Don't let him turn green.  You won't like him when he gets angry.  He looks like he's going to cry.  No, I'm going to be honest with you.  Oh, God.  Here comes.  Let him talk.  This is going to be douche chills.  I'm telling you.  Oh, you know, freak you then. 
[01:01:30]  Do you realize he can kill everyone in this room in three seconds?  Do you want to be the guy going, ah, ah?  I just...  How come every time I try to talk to you, you give me crap, and then...  Yeah.  Because you have guys that put puppets on their penis, and you're like, how you been?  How you doing, pal?  I mean, come on.  Yeah, there is no rhyme or reason to it, is there?  Yeah, you never really treat me too nicely.  You're on the air.  We're treating you very nice.  No, but then every time we're at a road show, you're like, Norris, stand by my shoulder.  Stay by me.  Stay by me.  I've never said that.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Now, go ahead. 
[01:02:00]  No, just things worked out.  Here we go.  Oh, my God, Opie, you are taunting death.  No, he's not.  No, I just...  I have a tough time, anyone talking seriously to me.  I'll confess it on the air today.  All right, it won't be serious then.  Opie, throw a pancake chisel out of me.  Throw a pancake chisel out of me.  I want those guys, if someone starts getting serious, you know, and talking real nice,  I get those chills.  Yeah, like what are you trying to tell me?  I'm queer or something?  No, I wasn't going that way, to be honest with you.  What are you... 
[01:02:30]  I'm saying...  I'll give you a nice compliment.  Now, now, don't back off.  Now, you've got to say exactly what you're going to say.  I am.  Don't water it down.  I just want to say...  You need to feel very uncomfortable right now.  No, but then, you know what?  Good.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, I just want...  I appreciate...  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, Jesus Christ!  You're going to let me talk.  Oh, you're funny, Tommy.  Which one?  What do you mean I'm funny?  No, no, because...  All right, hold on.  No, no, no, no.  He knows what he says.  He's a big boy.  I'll be okay.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead, Jeff.  How am I doing Pesci to the Hulk?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say. 
[01:03:00]  No, I'm just appreciative of being on the air and helping me out with things.  And Sunday, I'm competing in the U.S. Comedy Festival.  There you are.  Turn it off, Bob.  Oh, my God.  Oh, turn it off.  Opie, you are suicidal.  Turn it off or I'll curse.  No, no, no.  We don't have many dumps.  We don't not have many dumps.  Don't curse.  All right, just turn this off.  It didn't sound sincere.  Well, that's because you're playing queer music.  Let's hear it again.  No, no, no.  No, I'm done.  Where are you competing?  No, listen to it in reruns.  No, look. 
[01:03:30]  Where is it?  The music is out.  Say it again, please.  You know what?  Okay, you know, you've got a billion comments.  You know what?  I want to hear this because we take care of a lot of comedians in New York and most of  them aren't appreciative.  Well, that's what I'm about to tell you.  All right, let's go.  How many guys thank you?  I mean, Jay does.  I know Jim Brewer does.  Voss uses you like a $2 whore.  And what I'm telling you, I've got no CDs.  But I really appreciate it, man.  Appreciate what?  I appreciate you letting me on the air. 
[01:04:00]  And I appreciate Otto.  If you're listening, I want to thank Otto for stuff he did for me, too.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I just came to say hello.  I don't want any bloody knuckles.  All right.  All right, why don't you say whatever...  No, I'm not done.  What are you saying?  Whatever your comedians should be saying to us.  Whatever your comedians should be saying to us.  Where are your comedians?  No, you should just...  People should appreciate what you...  Don't put your fingers back where they were. 
[01:04:30]  I'm not doing anything.  Everybody should just appreciate what you do, except buster my balls.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Oh, my God.  Have a point.  Oh, my God.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Why do I even come here?  I should have just taken a little bit of fame I got with the frickin' stickers and rant.  I'm sorry.  Where are you competing?  There's a Sunday at Rascals in West Orange.  It's what it is.  It's the auditions for the U.S. Comedy Festival.  And I got a spot on it, and I'm pretty proud of that, and I want to say thank you. 
[01:05:00]  So, you've done a lot for your career?  You can help me out, sure.  Best of luck.  You're such a prick, man.  You are such a prick.  Ovi is the worst.  I can't...  Do you realize he could tear you in half?  This is the only way I can deal with it when someone gets serious with me.  I get just chills, so I have to kind of fool around with it a little bit.  Things were rough for a while, and I burnt my legs, and then my father...  Be more funny!  I will.  Oh, my God.  Do you see his face when you do that, Ovi? 
[01:05:30]  Do you see it?  He's getting provoked.  This is getting worse than pancake chisel.  I haven't done anything.  Do you realize he could break you in half with Steve and Big Kev on his back at the same time?  Just leave my blonde locks alone if you're going to beat me up.  That's all that will be left.  Right.  He'll rip your hair off.  All right, go ahead.  And beat you with it, your own scalp.  I'm sorry.  I have the problem, not you.  Things are just starting to work out after a little medical struggle I had, so I'll put 
[01:06:00]  it that way.  Walk it off, dick.  Oh, my God.  Ovi, you know what's going to happen?  Are you cursing?  Four years from now, he's going to be sitting on some other radio show going, then I snapped  his arm, I broke his jaw, his eye socket, and I pulled his junk off and shoved it down  his own throat.  And I made sure he never talked again.  Yeah.  I pulled his tongue right out of his throat and entered his radio career.  Tell me.  Tell me you're pushing the buttons. 
[01:06:30]  I know you're pushing the buttons.  I'm not pushing the buttons.  Tell me.  You know, you're a lying, lowlife, gambling, degenerate, mother-frickin' prick.  You know, that's what you are.  No, that's great, Chuck.  All right.  No, this is very good.  I'm sorry for showing a prank.  No, actually, actually, Anthony.  Now, go get your shine box.  You mother-frickin' mutt!  You phony, tough guy!  Huh?  Keep him here!  Keep him here!  You frickin' prick!  Okay.  Anthony, actually, Jeff Norris recorded his, what did he want to say to us, because he knew  this was going to happen. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, really?  Before he came in.  Oh, Dom, what are you doing?  Before he came in today.  Notice how my hands are in complete view.  I can't believe that.  They're not near anybody.  No, you recorded...  You really turned into a dick, man.  You recorded something nice.  No, no, you really turned into a dick.  You recorded something nice.  It was on my phone.  I just...  And I've been wanting to say that since last softball season.  You turned into a dick.  I just want to play for everybody.  I got it off my machine in the back office, Anthony.  I believe this is Jeff Norris, talking about his appreciation for the show.  Don't you do it! 
[01:07:30]  Don't!  Don't!  Oh, my God.  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh, my God.  Look, see?  He's taking his jacket off.  Why is he taking his jacket off?  He's taking his jacket off.  No, why...  No.  It's not near.  I think he's fucking stuck.  Okay.  All right.  I think we have audio...  Anyway, I want to say something else before you ask me some more.  No, I have audio of Opie from the future.  Oh, okay. 
[01:08:00]  After you hit him.  Okay.  Hey, you...  You, uh...  You, uh...  You, uh...  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  That's one punch.  That's funny, man.  Now, this morning...  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn.  Classic.  You are taunting King Kong, Opie. 
[01:08:30]  This morning...  So, you want...  I was on...  No, wait a minute.  There's something else you want to say, right?  Yeah.  This morning, I was on...  Let's go while we're young!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are you looking at his face, Opie?  Are you looking at his face?  Are you looking at his face, Opie?  Or anything?  I'm getting, like, cotton on it.  What do you think of, stupid?  All right, go ahead.  This morning, I was on New Jersey News Channel...  NJN News.  Oh, oh, oh.  You don't get it here.  It's no big deal.  But they were interviewing comics from Jersey that are competing in this festival.  And I want to say, for a change, I plugged you guys on New Jersey News. 
[01:09:00]  Oh!  They brought yous up, and it was a nice thing.  See?  Look at that, Opie.  We're plugging the show.  What happened?  You, really...  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm glad your hair got longer, because I could crib you by that.  Oh, my God.  You are a dick.  No, you don't understand him.  I'm always nice to him.  Sandy's always nice to me.  And nothing but grief, right?  No.  It's ridiculous.  Nothing but grief.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:09:30]  You're going to not afford to look ridiculous.  All right.  Well, I appreciate what you have to say.  Yeah, I know you do.  I do.  I just have a tough time listening to this stuff.  Opie, shut up.  Wait, what?  All right.  Well, we're going to talk about priests in a few minutes here.  Oh.  Oh, this hot, sexy subject.  Did you get it all out?  Anything else there?  I'm done.  You sure? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, I'm done.  Someone was saying you were at their firehouse, and you were totally hilarious.  There you go.  Oh, yeah?  Look, I'll give you something.  John?  Hey, John.  Open it, Anthony.  What's up?  Beck and Z.  What's up, bro?  What's up, man?  Jeff Morris was at our firehouse a few weeks ago.  I told him I was going to call that night.  He was at Copac Firehouse.  Oh, yeah.  We had a packed house.  We had a packed house, and man, he was the funniest NFL that was there.  There you go.  Look at that.  Thank you.  You guys got to have him on the show more often. 
[01:10:30]  Yes, we will.  Yes, we will.  We have some audio of him at that appearance.  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  All right, we've got to take a break.  Let the record state that I put that phone call on the air.  Thank you.  I didn't have to do that.  Let the record state.  That was very nice.  I'm trying to save my ass, because it gets ugly.  Oh, stop.  I'm not going to do nothing.  All right.  What was I going to, um, oh, crap.  There was something. 
[01:11:00]  Hey, anybody in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, come to Pips this weekend.  Pips?  Yeah.  Is that who you're going to be?  A lot of people underestimate that club.  That's a good club, man.  That was the, no.  Hey, it's where the Dice Mates started.  Who's moaning?  Who's that now?  No one moans.  Victim number two.  No one moans, Jeff.  That's all you have to know about.  No, I don't understand.  No one moans.  No, no, no.  No one moans.  Guys come up here, and they say, hey, how you been?  Well, I'm going to be over to this place this weekend.  And then you have all of the people coming up here, and then you have, I can't even mention 
[01:11:30]  nothing.  You can mention whatever you like.  And who's that guy in the morning?  He's scary, man.  Translation, boring.  Oh.  I didn't do that one.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Anthony did.  I've been looking at the computer screen here.  I am not a part of your shenanigans, okay?  I'm a new person.  I don't get mad anymore.  Yeah, right.  I don't.  I'm not the same.  Look at your face.  That's sunburned.  And that's makeup.  That's makeup.  Oh, yeah.  That girl, Danielle, who did your makeup at the XFL thing, said to say hello. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, I remember her.  She did Norton's makeup for a Colin Quinn show or something.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Jeff Norris.  Yeah, thank you.  Best of luck in the comedy competition.  He's going to hang, I guess.  Yeah, if it's all right.  Like, we have a choice?  Yes, you do.  You know, let me tell you something.  That's why.  No, you ain't going to break.  Freak it.  This is why I don't come around.  Oh, my God.  All right, calm down. 
[01:12:30]  No, this is why I'm coming around.  You feel like, you know, you're not wanted, so you don't come around.  I'm serious.  You're wanted.  You're here.  Yeah, I'm wanted.  It's always the ones with the big muscles.  They don't feel wanted.  Why is that?  You're wanted.  I'm wanted.  All right.  Like colon cancer.  We're going to talk about priests next, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  Priests in the news.  Priests.  Sex.  All right.  He's a son of a bitch.  I'm sorry. 
[01:13:00]  That guy's a rapist.  Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Got to love corn, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Here to stay.  We had the world premiere of this song.  Hey, I could have had it first, but it was locked in Dave's office. 
[01:13:30]  I couldn't break in.  Let's go tickle another intern.  Yeah, tickle the intern.  Intern.  Funny bit.  Boy, that's a great letter we got.  Where's that letter?  Where is the Rocco's ex-intern?  Not even an intern, was it?  Somebody that worked at the station?  I don't even know.  Like worked at...  Hold on, Rob.  Worked at one of the sister stations that were right next to... 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's explained in the letter.  Yeah.  Ben's running down the hall to get it.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, bro.  Pleasure for me to be on the radio.  Pleasure for me.  Yeah, what's going on?  Pleasure.  I'm just watching all this crap about Cardinal Law here in Boston.  It's just ridiculous.  We got all this stuff going on over in Israel.  Don't worry about pedophile priests over here in the United States.  Just so stupid.  Well, hey, man.  We have sicker priests in New York than you have in Boston.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I don't know.  The Boston priests, pretty sick.  Yeah.  Yeah, but at least our priests down here in New York are banging women. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  The ones up in Boston like the boys.  That's right.  At least down here, we're banging the women, our priests.  Yeah, that's a plus.  Look at the fag priests up there in Boston.  Yeah.  It's just so stupid how much they're covering up here in Boston.  I mean, they just had a press conference with, what's it called, like the spokesman person  for the archdiocese.  And it was just pretty much just a roundabout piece of BS about how Cardinal Law is staying  and he's not going to leave because of the pressure of all that.  He knows about all these pedophile priests and stuff.  No one knows. 
[01:15:00]  You know what the good thing for the Catholic Church is?  No one really knows the hierarchy in religion.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm supposed to be.  You know, I was born a Catholic.  I know who the head muckety-muck is.  But it's like you got the Pope.  But then there's like the bishops, the cardinals, the archbishop guys.  What is it?  I think the cardinals are one step away from being the Pope, right?  Being the Pope?  No.  What about the archbishop?  I think the archbishop is after the cardinal.  Cardinal, archbishop.  Yeah.  Then what? 
[01:15:30]  Pope, cardinal, archbishop.  And who's on the bottom?  Young boy.  Altar boy.  Yes.  Altar boy is on the bottom always.  Wow.  Ho, ho.  They do always have those cool hats, though.  Get on your knees.  Ho, ho.  All right.  Accept this.  This is my jizz.  Oh, man.  Drink of my mule.  Bow.  Bow.  Bow.  Well, Rob, the ladies in our area, it's in the New York paper today. 
[01:16:00]  We can brag about this priest.  Yeah, I know.  This story's kind of hot in a weird way.  New priest affair.  Shock.  Report.  He fathered child.  And Egan kept it quiet.  Our cardinal kept it quiet.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what all these higher-ups are getting in trouble for, is keeping all this  quiet for so many years.  They never said a word.  Hold on.  If it wasn't the church, then they'd be running right in there like they are with Enron, you  know, season everything.  But it's because it's the church, you know.  They think it's all just like holier-than-thou, a bunch of crap, you know. 
[01:16:30]  They're covering up criminal activity.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  No problem.  It's a Catholic church, though.  They've been doing that for years.  By the way, this article explains the hierarchy because...  Oh, it does.  Because before Cardinal Egan became Cardinal here in New York, he was the bishop of Bridgeport,  Connecticut.  There's a bishop.  And an archbishop?  Archbishop, right?  Isn't that like a big bishop?  And they can only move diagonally, Opie.  Only diagonally.  I know that much. 
[01:17:00]  I'm not stupid.  All right, so when he was bishop of Bridgeport, Connecticut, Cardinal Edward Egan didn't tell  cops about a sexual relationship between a 15-year-old girl and a priest that amounted  to statutory rape under state law.  Egan, now head of the Archdiocese of New York, let Joseph Michael Deshawn leave the priesthood.  Let him what?  Leave the priesthood?  Leave, yeah.  Oh, okay.  After the young woman told Deshawn she was pregnant, she was fired as a receptionist at 
[01:17:30]  the rectory.  And says today she's angry that the church hid Deshawn's misconduct.  She was a receptionist at the rectory.  Dude, this story gets really, really crazy.  Oh, God.  People shouldn't be naive, she said.  The church hides things, too.  Yes, they do.  Yeah, but there's no surprise.  The church has been doing waxed out stuff for centuries.  It's a whole mentality of uptight sexuality that has to come out somewhere. 
[01:18:00]  There's no way, as human beings, you could deny basic biology under the guise of serving  a lord.  It don't work.  You're still going to want, ah, pull, ah, pull, ah, pull, ah.  You're still going to want it.  And if you're a gay guy, you're still going to want the boys.  Norton was an altar boy.  It's nothing that is going to change if you put on a suit with a white collar on it.  It's going to work.  Guess who was an altar boy? 
[01:18:30]  Norton.  And he's going to interrupt this segment to tell us.  Tom from New Orleans.  Oh, no.  Hi, you boys.  Oh.  Hi, Tom.  How are y'all down there, darling?  Tom?  Tom, what happened?  Tom?  He's bright.  Take the priest's junk out of your mouth and talk.  He's gone.  He's gone.  I don't pay for no roving charges.  Oh, man.  Change of number.  All right, let me read the rest of this here.  The church hides things, too. 
[01:19:00]  The relationship began in 1988.  The woman said she and Deshaun sometimes had sex in the rectory and nearly got caught twice.  Once by a nun and another time when a discarded condom was found on the floor.  Oh, now he's...  Heard Deshaun?  That's bad, too, because they don't believe in birth control like that.  His name was Deshaun?  Deshaun.  Black priest?  No.  No.  As far as we know.  I don't mean it in a bad way.  Father Deshaun.  There could be a white Deshaun.  No, there's not.  If his first name was Deshaun. 
[01:19:30]  No, there's not a white Deshaun in the world.  It's a white...  It's his last name, right?  It's a white priest because his first name...  That's like saying there's a smart boss.  Hey.  It's a white priest because his first name's Michael.  Yeah, it's his last name.  Oh, wait.  Michael Jordan.  Damn.  I don't know how many black guys named Michael, though, Ant.  Michael Irvin.  All right.  Sure there is.  Shut my mouth.  Mike Tyson.  All right.  Don't matter.  That was stupid.  When the woman became pregnant, Deshaun, now a fifth grade public school teacher in Jersey,  gave church officials her name and said she worked at the rectory, okay? 
[01:20:00]  Now 28, the mother is raising her daughter in Bridgeport.  I was young and naive and had very low self-esteem, and he was this priest who could do no wrong,  she told the Bridgeport paper.  The mother said she lived with Deshaun until their daughter was two, first in a Vermont cabin,  and later with Deshaun's parents in Jersey, the priest's parents in Jersey.  That sounds a little weird.  His parents didn't know my age because she was 15, and he told me not to tell them.  I felt the whole situation wasn't right. 
[01:20:30]  Eventually, she took their daughter and moved in with her family in Bridgeport, and it just  goes on and on and on.  Tony, what did you say to Father Frank?  Why did he leave the church?  What did you say?  He'll go back to the church.  He'll go back.  He'll go back.  All right.  Tom's calling back.  Yo, Tom.  Damn.  Tom.  That was a long beat.  No, nothing happened, man.  I don't know. 
[01:21:00]  I don't recall anything like that, but I did let us drink some wine.  You were an altar boy?  Yeah.  How old were you when you were an altar boy?  I guess like around like 9, 10, 11.  9, 10, 11?  Did the priest photograph you sitting on a sink of a bathroom with a mirror behind him?  No, he didn't.  With his junk cubed out like you do with your wife?  But we're such a dick.  But we could drink the wine. 
[01:21:30]  That's one thing.  Oh, he let you drink the wine at 11?  Yeah.  How much wine would the priest let you drink at 11?  I mean, just enough to taste, you know, like the blood of Christ and stuff.  Right.  Just enough to get the bad taste out of your mouth.  It wasn't so much drinking the wine.  And it was what he poured it on that we drank it from.  That's right.  He called us his little kittens and we had a suckle.  We did body shots.  Body shots off of the father.  That's how we do it in New Orleans.  I didn't know why the confessional had a glory hole. 
[01:22:00]  But I said, what the hell?  It's Mardi Gras.  Oh, he just...  What happened to his phone again?  I don't think he can take our abuse anymore.  The power of Christ compels you to suck.  Well, yeah.  Speaking of which, Anthony, speaking of that, yeah, it seems like these priests are having  more sex than Oz.  Yeah, I know.  They're boys, girls, little bit of everything.  And I do believe...  Like an episode of Oz where there's 20 episodes of sex in every show.  I do believe we have some audio, Anthony.  Oh, really?  From Monastery Oz. 
[01:22:30]  Oh.  I trust you are unclean-spirited.  Show her up, you're...  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  It is he who commands you.  He who floods you from the heads of heaven and the depths of hell.  Oh, Jim.  Be gone.  Jim, hear us from the streets of God.  Okay. 
[01:23:00]  Whoa.  Ooh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I demand you by the judge of the living and the dead to impart the servant of God.  You're a requisite farmer.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, Carter.  The power of Christ compels you.  I can't wait to go to church.  Come on.  Oh, thank you, Lord.  You're crazy.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  God the Father commands you.  God the Son commands you. 
[01:24:00]  God the Holy Spirit commands you.  God the Son commands you.  God the blood of the martyrs commands you.  Oh, ah.  Hey, I'm having a little taste of, uh, monastic.  Man, I never noticed how hot that sounds.  Oh, you like that?  Don't you faggot?  Hang the phone up, you skank. 
[01:24:30]  Dickie, dickie, dickie.  Yeah, you like that, don't you, bitch?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Time for the sacrament.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ah, that's a winner.  What the?  That priest is horrible.  He's disgusting.  And I got to be drummed out of the service.  Oh, sex with a girl.  Yuck.  All right, uh, before we go to break, I think Stephen Lynch wraps it up nice with this little ditty. 
[01:25:00]  It's written from the perspective of a priest that I knew many years ago when I was going through some troubled times.  I went to him for some advice, some love advice.  I'm sure he helped you.  He helped me out a great deal.  You're not a virgin anymore.  Great.  Jesus.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear, I kneel upon the floor.  Temptations of a Catholic priest aren't easy to ignore. 
[01:25:30]  But I cannot control myself.  It rips my soul apart.  For one small sheep among my flock has stolen a shepherd's heart.  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[01:26:00]  At Sunday mass or Bible class, I catch him in my view.  So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread eagled on the pew.  And when I see him in that frock, my conscience goes awry. 
[01:26:30]  I'll give him some communion wine that's spiked with Spanish fly.  Altar boy, altar boy, is it gonna be heaven or hell?  You can play my organ all night long, if you promise never to tell.  Oh, shh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Oh, father, what's in heaven? 
[01:27:00]  Hallowed be thy name.  I could dress him up like the Pope and then I'd, oh, dear God, the shame.  No, no, lead us not into temptation.  Deliver us from sin.  We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ and I was Mary Magdalene.  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me. 
[01:27:30]  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  Oh, altar boy, oh, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[01:28:00]  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Tori.  Tori.  The profound existence to me, let us know. 
[01:28:30]  Fall down.  The Opie and Anthony Show have been removed from the airwaves.  You know, that was...  Shouldn't have offended too many people, right?  I didn't swear.  What's the meaning of this slacking off?  Dude, it's all we need!  Whatever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A smorgasbord of idiocy.  The greatest radio that I've ever heard.  And E.W. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on today.  We got our buddy Jeff Norris.  Sweet and delicious.  Sweet and delicious.  Let's keep him happy so he doesn't cry on us.  Oh my God.  He's all happy right now, Anthony.  Keep him that way.  He's the frosted side of the mini-weed if you watch the commercials for frosted mini-weeds on TV.  I can read most people.  He's either going to break down and cry in front of us today because he's so appreciative. 
[01:29:30]  What are you talking about, man?  Or he's going to snap one of our necks.  Neither, man.  One of our?  No.  It's all you, my friend.  Man, you're making me sound like such a bad person.  We're also finding out that Jeff Norris is going to have an audition to be on Oz.  Yeah.  He's going to be someone's prison bitch.  I am not.  Stop it.  That's what you were telling us.  I did not even say that.  Did you say you're trying out for Oz?  But I didn't say I was going to be somebody's bitch.  Ant, he'll be out here.  Ant, did I say I was going to be somebody's bitch? 
[01:30:00]  He absolutely did not say that.  What do you think?  I'm going to back you up on this with this guy?  You didn't say that during commercial.  That you have an audition for Oz.  Yeah.  And they want you to do a little something something.  No, I said it was a fight scene.  You know, big muscle guy like you and, you know.  But you said it's cool because you're the pitcher.  I should have kept my mouth shut.  I'm only kidding.  It's not gay because you're the pitcher.  No, that was on PlayStation.  PlayStation Oz I was on.  I just do many weeks. 
[01:30:30]  Come on.  What if they say.  I've got to talk to you about grand theft.  What if they say.  All right.  What if they say you can get a part in Oz, but you have to bend this new fish over in  the shower and rail him.  You're not really doing it.  But I still couldn't.  Yeah, I'll be at Caroline's one night.  Hey, that's the tattoo guy that takes it in a can.  Jeff.  No, you'll give it.  Jeff.  Oz is one of the hottest shows out there right now.  This is what he really said to us during commercials.  Don't lie.  Why are you going to lie?  I'm going to tell him.  No, you're going to lie like a rug. 
[01:31:00]  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are because you're smirking.  You're going to be really surprised when I say word for word what you said.  All right.  Let's see.  You told us that you're going to have an audition for Oz, right?  And we asked you if it's going to be some gay thing.  And you said, no way will I do that.  And I are saying that if they tell you to do some gay thing for one of the hottest shows  on TV, you're doing it, my friend.  I couldn't.  I will bet money.  They'll just say.  Oh, no.  No, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. 
[01:31:30]  No, no.  Can I borrow your belt, please?  You beat some guy down in the shower, right?  And then all you're doing is like you step up and you just hear him go, ah!  Ah!  Yeah.  Oh, simulate it.  It's done artistically.  See, the joke is on him because you're not gay.  Right.  And the joke's on all the millions of people watching.  Because, you know, they don't know you're not gay, but we all do. 
[01:32:00]  The odds are, if you're trying out for Oz, there's going to be some gay thing involved.  You think?  The odds are there.  Right?  Hopefully it'll be like, they'll stab me, kill me, and gang rape me so I'm dead now.  I can't be alive for it.  All right.  Also, Anthony.  Yeah.  Can't be alive for it.  We're trying to get Super GM Ken Stevens on the phone.  Yeah.  He's responsible for this mess we call the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to find out what the deal is.  Well, one of the cities may be dropping us after today's show. 
[01:32:30]  Uh-huh.  We were supposed to get a decision at 5 o'clock.  Now they want to wait until Monday.  Here's my take on this.  And they've been kind of dilly-dallying, whatever that thing is.  Dilly-dallying.  For about two weeks now.  For weeks now.  And you know something?  They didn't need another goddamn three hours to decide what to do.  I think you're in shape, though, because they're Mini Wheat fans.  Very good.  Thank you.  They are effing us.  And we can go somewhere else. 
[01:33:00]  We can absolutely go somewhere else and kick your ass.  They either want us or they don't.  Right.  So it's time for Fred Flintstone to make a decision and tell us.  Off it up.  Figure it out.  You want to keep us because you want the show or get rid of us.  You can't hold on to us and tell us another week, another day, hoping we don't go somewhere else.  Because you know something?  We are going to go somewhere else.  We will go somewhere else in your city.  And you will look back and go, oh, my dear, sweet Jesus Christ, what did I do? 
[01:33:30]  What did I do?  I effed up because now they're kicking my ass.  And it absolutely will happen.  I guarantee that will happen.  They don't need any more time.  He's wasting time to try to stretch this out as long as possible.  We will go to another station.  Ken's listening to us in Washington right now.  Yeah.  Or Ken's people down there.  We need Ken on the air.  Please, someone help us out.  Come on.  What the hell's he doing?  We just want to see where we're at.  Right now. 
[01:34:00]  I heard...  It's so funny, the guy responsible for all this is the guy that ended up firing us when  we were in Boston.  Yeah, he's got to make the decision.  Oh, man.  Fires us.  We hate the guy to this day.  And now he works for the same company we do.  And now he's making these decisions.  Great business move.  We will destroy your station.  Destroy it.  Just ask how they're doing over there.  Give WAF in Boston a call.  Give them a little phone call. 
[01:34:30]  Let them know how the battle's going over there.  Then you'll see.  But you either want us or you don't.  Right.  There's no more.  No more we're going to see wait till Monday, wait this, wait an hour.  No, no more waiting.  That's it.  Over.  Done.  We'll go somewhere else.  Believe me.  Believe me.  There are plenty of places to go.  And we'll kick your ass.  We're starting to think we want to break up so we can start banging a new chick.  Right.  There you go.  Stop stringing us along. 
[01:35:00]  You're the old hose bag right now.  That's right.  You're the old hose bag.  The old rag hose bag.  We have a tight one waiting for us.  Just let us know.  That's right.  We're going to slip it right in.  Not to wait for you.  So that's going on as well.  So where is he?  Huh?  Where's Ken?  What, Rick?  I tried.  You tried what?  His cell phone? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  And what do you get?  All I got was his message.  He wants to pick it up.  All right.  Someone in Washington, please tell Ken we need to talk to him.  We're just curious.  Is he in Washington right now?  Huh?  Yeah.  Is he in Washington?  Yeah.  Or is he in route?  Or route?  I say route.  You say route.  I don't know.  Damn it.  Tomato, tomato.  All right.  Dennis, what's going on?  How are you doing, guys?  All right.  I want to know of Dickless Dave's station manager.  Dave Dickless?  Yeah, whatever. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Well, might as well be.  Okay.  Might as well be.  Good to hear you guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  The last time I saw the PD of the station,  he didn't have the balls to tell me to my face that there were even problems.  Yeah.  I sat next to him for two hours.  Two hours.  Never works that way.  Two hours.  And the guy didn't have the balls to say,  hey, I got to let you know something, man.  You know, we're having problems with the show.  We're not sure if we want to keep it.  Didn't even have the balls.  I was right there.  Go ahead.  It doesn't matter.  And then on top of that, he's like, hey, 
[01:36:30]  I really want to put out the next O.P. and Anthony CD for you guys.  Yeah.  And hey, if you ever need voice work for your show,  I'm a real good voice guy.  I would love to do stuff for you guys.  Suck it.  He's two feet away from me for two hours.  Another two-faced corporate shill.  And then I leave town.  I leave town.  And then I find out when I get back.  I'm like, you've got to be effing kidding me.  I was walking around the station.  I've pretty much given it away at this point.  Corporate shill. 
[01:37:00]  I was at the station.  No one had the balls to say, hey, we've got to talk.  You've got to be kidding me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, good luck to you.  Go ahead.  Just cut it loose, man.  No more bull about how much longer and we'll wait until the end of the work day.  That's what I said when I heard at 3 o'clock, oh, end of the work day, we'll know.  Like, bull.  We're not going to know. 
[01:37:30]  And then what did Jeremy just say, Monday?  Is that what I just heard?  Yeah.  No, not Monday.  Monday, we start looking for a new station.  Monday, we start talking to new stations.  Screw this guy, man.  We might have to take a day off next week to fly into the city to work out a deal, actually.  Fine.  Let's do it.  So.  We'll do it for free.  You know, I mean, it's their prerogative to drop the show.  Oh, it absolutely is.  If they want, but to not even have the balls to call us up personally. 
[01:38:00]  To not even have the balls when I'm sitting two feet away from you for two straight hours.  Worm.  To not even have the balls when I'm walking around your station to go, hey, can we talk  for a few minutes?  Yeah.  And you want to be a bigwig in this company someday?  Good luck to you, my friend.  No Ken.  No Ken Stevens.  Ah, Phil.  On the phone.  Phil, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you're my saviors of my afternoon, let me tell you that. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, thanks.  Oh, Phil's coming from Sacramento.  I don't drive home one day without listening to you.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, my friend.  Hey, I want to talk about those WOW stickers.  They're working out here in Sacramento.  It's 80 degrees.  The women are wearing their bikini tops.  Nice.  And they're showing them off.  Nice.  Nice, yeah.  All right.  All right, man.  You guys suck.  I heard you guys got the WOW stickers out there in Sacramento.  Yes, I do.  I got them on my work truck.  I'm passing them out to the guys at work.  Cool.  I put them on all their work trucks.  All right.  Thanks, Phil.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, you guys better make sure you get WOW in your car for this coming Wednesday because 
[01:39:00]  the season is starting to build.  WOW is back in full season.  And if you don't put a homemade WOW on your car or you don't have a WOW bumper sticker,  you can send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York and we'll give you  the New York version.  Right, Ann?  The address is on opiananthony.com or if you have a good memory, it's 888 7th Avenue,  New York, New York, 10106.  All right.  Right.  I want to talk to Ken now.  I know.  We were supposed to find out.  He's hiding is what he's doing. 
[01:39:30]  They're hiding because they will talk to us about this when we get off the air at 7.  Can I be honest with you?  Conveniently.  Yeah.  I swear he's not hiding.  Doesn't want it on the air though, I bet.  No.  You don't think so?  No, because we're talking about it now.  You know?  On this one, I'm telling you, he's way on our side.  He doesn't understand it either.  Nah.  I just, you know, any management that gets higher than Ben, I don't trust.  Why is this Fred Flintstone guy still in our lives?  Yeah.  And part of our careers? 
[01:40:00]  Well, this guy, we made a lot of money for our old company.  Yeah.  And we effed up in Boston.  Everyone knows the mayor thing.  And instead of being a man saying, hey, man, you guys are fired.  He's going to look us in the eye and go, like we are insects.  We're going to have to terminate your contracts.  We're going to terminate your contracts.  Terminate with extreme prejudice.  Terminate.  Yeah.  We've got to terminate.  But now, see, here's the beauty of it.  We had nothing back then. 
[01:40:30]  Now, we can turn around, get on another station, and stomp this guy.  You know that Fred Flintstone was responsible for us getting kicked out of Austin after five weeks?  I heard about that, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy that fired us in Boston?  Mm-hmm.  He was behind the Austin thing.  And after five weeks said, yeah, yeah, go ahead.  If you don't want him anymore, go ahead.  Right.  Make the decision.  Do it.  No phone call, nothing.  Oh, well.  Always winning the end.  Always.  Sometimes we have to wait a long time. 
[01:41:00]  It took years.  It took years to do it in Boston.  But we wait, and it happens.  Oh, really?  Okay.  We're looking forward to that, Ben.  Holy jeez, I love when this happens.  Stay tuned, people, because in a matter of minutes, something funny is going to happen.  Speaking of winning.  This is one of the simple little pleasures we get, pleasures we get in life.  We have so many battles we have to take care of that we don't even have time to do a radio show anymore. 
[01:41:30]  We have a lot of fronts, and we got people going here, people going there.  It's a multi-fronted war that we're on, and one of the fronts is ready to go into battle in a matter of seconds.  Wait till we tell you about our Mission Impossible scheme.  We were hashing it over in the office.  We were hashing out something in the office today that could get Antoni five to ten years in the joint.  But it would be great.  I swear to you.  And we were dead serious.  Yeah.  It entails all kinds of fun stuff. 
[01:42:00]  Just watch an episode.  No, no, I'm not going to say a word.  But just watch an episode.  Because I still think we can pull it off without getting too screwed.  Watch an episode of the old Mission Impossible TV show, and that will give you an inkling of what this entails.  I guess you're hiring me again, then.  This will be the biggest thing ever.  You know that we're working on three things right now behind the scenes?  Right now.  Right now as we speak.  Three things could be going down.  If one or two of them go through, forget about it. 
[01:42:30]  It's going to make for some great radio.  And the third thing is the Mission Impossible.  That's Mission Impossible, and it's going to take so much organizing.  But if it does happen, oh, my God.  We figure it's going to take us at least a year.  Yeah.  To get all the ducks in line, as they say, to pull this off.  So everything lines up, and the planets are aligned, and this happens, and it's giant.  I'm getting a fake face made, Anthony. 
[01:43:00]  A mask.  Yeah, yeah.  So I can pull it off at the end.  And then, ha-ha, I got you.  Wasn't that always fun?  Where the guy finally confesses to his buddy or something in Mission Impossible, and then  he grabs, like, under his jawline and by the side of his ear and pulls the face mask off.  Oh, my God.  I just confessed to Martin Landau.  Oh, no.  I'm screwed.  The perfect mask.  Yeah, we're going to need a mask. 
[01:43:30]  Are we going to need that device that Tom Cruise used to lower us down through a trap door on the roof?  What do we need?  A tape recorder that blows up after a few minutes.  And we're going to have to fly a helicopter through a train tunnel.  Yeah.  Man, you put this on PlayStation, it would be better than Grand Theft Auto.  Love the Grand Theft Auto 3.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's coming out for PC.  I won't know.  I never get off EverQuest anymore.  Hopi, I've got to tell you something.  I feel so honored.  You know how, you were in a fraternity in college, right? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, big time.  The figs of Geneseo.  Now, is that a big, popular fraternity?  72 Sennestreet, sure.  Popular fraternity?  We were all the drug dealers.  All the other fraternities needed the drugs.  Was it a fraternity, let's say, that a lot of people wanted to get into really bad?  Oh, big time.  Because we were all banging the five lambs, Anthony.  Only a few got in.  Five lambs were the hottest girls, and they were our sister sorority.  Oh, yeah.  Only a few got in?  Yeah.  And as you walked around, and people knew you were part of this fraternity, did other  people look at you like, wow, ask you questions? 
[01:44:30]  Hey, how do I get in?  Can I tell you a good story about the story and walking around with the letters?  Uh-huh.  There was a guy.  I can't believe I'm telling this story.  Well, it was a professor, let's just say.  And something bad happened to his daughter a long time ago, way before I went to Geneseo,  and way before I joined this fine fraternity.  Right.  Something really bad to the daughter.  Mm-hmm.  But rumor has it she was really into it.  Yeah.  So it wasn't against her will. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  The professor found out.  Had a nervous breakdown.  They found him in a closet.  Oh, jeez.  To this day, I think he's finally retired.  But for many years afterwards, let's say.  Let's say by the time I went to Geneseo, maybe 15 years has passed.  Yeah.  We were instructed never, ever wear the fraternity colors to this guy's class.  Oh, really?  Because as soon as he saw the colors, you were done.  Didn't matter how talented you are. 
[01:45:30]  Didn't matter what kind of marks you got on the test.  Not in your best interest.  Automatic fee.  Not in your best interest.  No.  But anyways, yes, fraternity.  So they dug it, you know, Top Gun.  Opie, you know, I play EverQuest a lot.  It's one of my favorite video games that I play.  Right?  I was invited into the biggest guild on the Adrenal server.  Oh, we're talking about guilds again.  I was invited in.  And now, as you join one of these guilds.  Can you explain a guild? 
[01:46:00]  A guild is a group.  Is that SAG?  That gets together on the server in this game.  And you team up.  And next to your name, above your character, is the guild name.  And now I walk around and everyone's like, oh my god.  He's a member of the Cats in Hats guild, Opie.  Shut up and stop laughing.  Instead of SAG, that's FAG.  Hey, shut up.  Ooh, you're tough.  Gonna come in with your little guild shirt?  You don't know. 
[01:46:30]  You don't know.  It's the premier guild.  I was wondering why you were wearing a wizard hat today, Opie.  I am a shaman.  I am not a wizard.  And they are all level 60.  I am merely 52, yet they invited me in.  Yeah, the wizard hat, definitely tougher than wearing a fraternity jersey.  Yeah, definitely.  Fuck.  We'd be scared of you if we saw you at the in-between.  Why can't you appreciate the fact that I was accepted in this guild? 
[01:47:00]  I thought they mailed you a wizard hat.  No wizard hat was involved.  Do you have a sister guild with hot chicks?  No, I am a member of a very powerful guild on my server.  You're very powerful.  It's very powerful.  You can't.  We were on a raid the other day, and there were dragons, and I didn't even have my heat  protective gear on.  How funny is that?  How...  Well, I didn't.  It's Revenge of the Nerds. 
[01:47:30]  No, it...  Shut up!  I enjoy my gaming.  It's gonna have a...  Don't worry.  You guys will get the hot chicks in the end.  And I want to say hello to my...  Just like the movie.  ...my guildmates.  Guildmates?  Yes, they're the people in my guild.  You went from having threesomes to joining a guild?  What the hell's wrong with you?  Most people start in a guild and work up to threesomes.  You don't go backwards.  I thought you'd be happy for me. 
[01:48:00]  Wow.  Why don't you go outside every once in a while?  Because I'm on raids, and I'm killing creatures.  What kind of creatures are you killing?  Oh, I couldn't help it.  I wasn't a high enough level to use any of my spells on the big dragon, Opie.  I just had to sit back and watch.  So I'm not much help to them these days.  So you're a puke.  Yeah.  You're not even a real member of the guild yet.  No, I'm not.  They just kind of invite you in to join, and they're going to see if you're worthy enough.  So you're kind of like a plebe, a puke. 
[01:48:30]  They did let me loot a shield of worms off of one of the creatures, which is a very, very good shield, Opie.  So I appreciate that.  What's the matter, Norris?  You've really got to go out, man.  You've really got Anthony.  That is real.  I cannot believe you cannot appreciate what this is.  I am a loser.  I haven't had a girlfriend in over two years, and I go out with you.  Well, when you kill family members.  Stop it.  When they snap their neck, you know.  Oh, I'm not violent.  Word gets around.  Stop it. 
[01:49:00]  What would you do if you were hit with a pancake chisel?  Pancake chisel?  I don't know what I would do.  I would stop after breaking two bones and an eye socket.  Hey, Ann, I've got to play this song.  And an eye socket.  I've got your head in a voice.  Hey, Ken still hasn't called us, Anthony.  No.  Could someone call Melissa's house for me, please?  Oh, go.  Keith the cop, what's going on?  Well, I don't want Ann to be in the barrel by himself on this whole EverQuest thing.  You know, I was there last week when we went through this whole thing. 
[01:49:30]  Keith is the worst.  Keith freaked out last week because some kid, remember some kid called up?  Oh, yeah, this is good.  Some kid called up and said, I'll hook you up with whatever you need as far as equipment goes.  It's very hard to get good equipment in this game, I'll be.  It takes a long time, sometimes years.  So this kid was going to hook up Keith.  So Keith figures, all right, I'll get him some T-shirts, some stickers from the show,  and he'll give me some really good equipment.  It turns out this kid, how old was he? 
[01:50:00]  He's 14.  14 years old.  How old are you, Keith?  I'm 31.  All right, he's 31.  Keith figures, all right, he finds out the kid lives very close to where he lives.  Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, now that's starting to sound bad.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no.  Turn in your shield.  Because you had also spoken with his father.  Right, right, his dad happens to be a cop also.  So he figured he'd go to the house and drop off T-shirts and stuff to this kid.  So what happened?  Open Anthony T-shirts, right?  Right, right, right.  And I happen to be on right now, playing EverQuest, in case anyone's on the Iona Rose server. 
[01:50:30]  Free T-shirts.  Send it out to Salvin.  That's Alvin with an S.  And I'll drop T-shirts off to your 14-year-old son also.  So he tells me, he goes, I go up to the door, I knock.  Right, right.  I knock on the door.  You know how some kids can be 14 and, like, they're on the football team, so it's like, you know.  Keith, what did this kid look like?  You know, the kid opened the door, and it was, like, this small little, like, you know, 14-year-old kid. 
[01:51:00]  And here I am.  I felt like some dirty Catholic priest or something.  I got, like, these T-shirts in my hand.  It was almost like Better Off Dead when the kid opens the door and the mailman's got the stuff for him, like the dirty swank magazines or whatever.  You just felt dirty.  And he's like, I'm like, hey, how you doing?  And I handed him the T-shirt, and then I proceeded to just turn around and walk away, and I got my car, and I'm like, you know what?  I think I am a loser.  You've got a problem.  I have a problem. 
[01:51:30]  I had to call Ant and tell him right away.  Hold on.  Ben's got some.  You have more of a problem than you're leading on here.  You made me go through my whole desk because you wrote it down.  You couldn't find the piece of paper it was on.  And then we had to go through the whole tape of the show to find the kid's name because you couldn't find the guy's name.  Oh, yeah, because I couldn't remember how it was spelled.  Well, it gets very involved, and you want the good equipment.  All right.  Ben, just remember, I'm always there at 3 o'clock in the morning when you think you're getting arrested, regardless of the point.  All right, Keith, thank you. 
[01:52:00]  I'll talk to you guys later.  Oh, okay.  I just don't understand how you don't...  Yeah.  Is that a pledge pin?  No, I didn't get a pledge pin.  Are you sure?  I'm positive.  I don't have any pins on me.  You have a pledge pin on your wizard hat.  I don't have a wizard hat.  Oh, you're going to lie to your faithful listeners?  I don't wear a wizard hat.  You're sitting there with a wizard hat.  I am absolutely not sitting here.  With half-moon-shaped things on it.  Like Mickey?  Like Harry Potter. 
[01:52:30]  Like Harry Potter?  And you have some kind of weird purple cape on.  What's going on with you?  You'll never understand.  You'll never understand.  Are you a card-carrying member of the guild?  No, I'm not a card.  I was invited in.  Cats and hats, and I'm honored.  Cats and hats.  Cats and hats.  At least have a cool guild name.  Are you eating green eggs and ham, Tim?  Come on.  Cats and hats.  Green eggs and ham.  All right, we got to break.  Hey, Jack Goff. 
[01:53:00]  I think Jim Norton's awake by now.  Can we get him on the phone?  Okay.  He's playing Cleveland tonight.  We got to see what's going on with that.  I'm sure he'll have something to bitch about, right?  Oh, he's always bitching.  The accommodations, the flight, something will.  I also want to finally talk about fetishes.  We were supposed to talk about this Monday.  It's now Friday.  A lot of weird fetishes in the latest issue of Stuff Magazine.  I got to read the balloon fetish.  Nice.  Balloon fetish.  Yeah, there's a fetish out there that involves balloons.  Fetishes that involve other items besides just the people involved are a little weird. 
[01:53:30]  Armpit fetish.  That's actualism.  That's strange, too.  Mummification.  Those are like S&M ones.  They're just in the bondage ones where they like taking the straps and tying people up  until, like, their pieces of them are just, like, swooshed and flying out.  Purple.  That was the first job.  Ugh.  All right.  Why don't we, you know what?  We've got to play another Stephen Lynch song now.  Ah.  We haven't played the Dungeons & Dragons song in a while. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, come on now.  It's online.  It's not like I'm sitting with a big dice and a board or something.  Yeah, but didn't you tell me, like, every question is sort of similar to D&D?  Some of the characters and the things, but it's cool because it's, you know, it's on the computer.  Because it looks good graphically.  And you can team up.  And the options are much greater than they are with stupid Dungeons & Dragons.  All right, we'll go a little old school here for our older listeners that used to play D&D before computers and stuff, Anthony. 
[01:54:30]  I don't have a wizard hat on.  Yeah, all right.  I know.  I'm not a wizard.  And it's cool.  Okay, Anthony.  Did the scarf come with the hat?  Or was that...  Okay, Anthony.  We'll play along.  Scarf matches good, though, don't we?  Ah.  Got a robe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That caning thing.  Get a little harmonica.  I'm sorry. 
[01:55:00]  I got my 12-sided die and I'm ready to roll with a wizard and my goblin crew.  My friends are coming over to my mom's basement bringing Funyuns and the Mountain Dew.  I got a big broad sword made out of cardboard and that stereo's a pumpin' Zeppelin.  It's that time of the night.  We turn on the black light. 
[01:55:30]  Let the Dungeons and the Dragons begin.  It's D&D.  Fighting with the legends of yore.  It's D&D.  Never kissed a lady before.  Nope.  Woo!  All right.  Take it home.  All right.  A little solo, boy.  How much happened? 
[01:56:00]  Now the Lord of the Rings, the Dark Crystal and things, we use these as a reference tool.  And when we put on our cloaks and tell warlock jokes, we're the coolest kids at the school.  No, we're not.  I know.  Now, Tack's a real bastard, but a fair dungeon master.  He's got hit points and charisma to lend.  And I rehearse in my room are what I call the dragons tune when I'm not out with my girlfriend.  It's D&D.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got a girlfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  It's D&D.  It's D&D. 
[01:56:30]  Warriors who terrify.  It's D&D.  Virgins till the day we...  One, two, three, four.  D&D!  Yeah.  Nice.  Steven Lens. 
[01:57:00]  You got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh!  Go, you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Disturb the game.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.  Look what he's doing now.  Rock, rock, rock. 
[01:57:30]  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.  You're going to give children AIDS?  Hotsu! Hotsu! Hotsu!  Hotsu! Hotsu!  Hotsu! That's what I say! Hotsu!  We're waiting for a call from Jim Norton. 
[01:58:00]  Playing Cleveland tonight.  Yeah.  Well, I'm getting steamed now.  Yeah.  Also, we've got to talk about the guy that has a finger for a schlong.  For a schlong.  Science and medicine gone too far, Opie.  Gone too far.  He's got his whole arm on the whole arm.  Jimmy Schubert! 
[01:58:30]  What's up, Opie and Anthony?  What's up, Schubert?  Nothing much, brother.  I was just calling to see how you guys are doing.  Where the hell have you been?  You know, I try to keep a low profile, brother.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm one of the only guys in show business trying to keep a low profile.  You know what I mean?  You didn't keep a low profile when we were hanging in Philly.  No, no, no.  But that's Philly.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  I mean, you know, I'm like the unofficial mayor of the town.  Schubert used to tour with Sam Kinnison, Anthony. 
[01:59:00]  Yes.  And you guys also got me in trouble because Kinnison was...  Bill Kinnison called you guys the other day and was pissed at me.  Why?  Oh, because apparently I told you guys about him and LeBeau were feuding or something like that.  I don't know.  He left a message on the machine.  He's a little upset.  I remember one story you said about Roseanne.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  Maybe it was something to do with that.  Roseanne gave Jimmy Schubert oral treats. 
[01:59:30]  She gave her...  Yeah, Roseanne.  Yeah, it's great.  She took a chunky load of man chowder right down the guzzler.  I was hungry.  Oh, my God.  How can you even accept that?  How do you tell your friends that?  If he let Roseanne do it and she's famous,  imagine the girls he's let do it that aren't famous.  Hey, man.  I'm going to have one of guys from mine do it.  Your resume.  You can see it on my resume.  Oh, man. 
[02:00:00]  So everything's cool with you?  Everything's cool with me.  I'm actually getting ready to head back there in a little bit.  I was going to kind of...  Yeah.  You know, I'm just a fine thing.  It's been a pain in my...  The rectum because, you know, they're checking everybody.  Now, the guy took my nail clipper.  He took your nail clipper?  Yeah, yeah.  You're pretty good to hijack and play with a damn nail clipper.  Yeah.  Timmy, hold on one second.  All right.  One second.  We've got to go to Boston and say hi to Psycho Tim.  Hey, Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  No.  I'm here with Michael Rocco. 
[02:00:30]  Bunch of faggy kids.  I'm going to get some stuff.  Yeah.  I'm going to get some stuff.  Yeah.  We're sending it out of there.  Hey, Rocco.  Rocco.  Want to talk to R.A.?  We're not here right now.  Want to talk to R.A.?  Want to talk to a real radio show?  I don't know.  No, no.  Now, you have to get a plug in there.  Get some of the play.  Nice.  It's like this guy.  What the problem?  How are you?  You got to know where you're going, Rocco.  You got to know what I mean?  No.  You got to know what I mean? 
[02:01:00]  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  I'm busy with you guys.  What the hell?  They suck on this place.  You got to start.  You got to start.  You got to start.  I don't know you're off of here.  Come on, Rocco.  You're part of Ryan Ross.  Keep going with me, Rocco.  Right here.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Keep going, Rocco.  You're a fucking villain.  You're a fucking villain.  You're a fucking villain. 
[02:01:30]  You're a fucking villain.  You're a fucking villain.  This is not awesome.  Just take your fucking shit.  You're a fucking villain.  Yeah, Rocco's doing fake radio at a bar called Copperfields right now near Fenway.  And there goes Psycho Tim.  Oh, who's that kid, man?  Psycho Tim.  Who is he?  Psycho Mark's brother.  Psycho Mark's brother.  Tim from up in Massachusetts.  I got to meet him, man.  Massachusetts.  Wow, did he...  He is awesome.  Right now.  Did he just nail rock?  I will guarantee he will call back.  Right now, he is in a fight.  That kid is awesome, man. 
[02:02:00]  Wow.  Guaranteed.  Man, that kid is...  That kid has walls.  I like him.  O&A Army, I think Psycho Tim needs some help at Copperfields.  Dude, get on a plane.  We're talking about Boston, not down the street.  He's relentless.  He's friggin' relentless.  Rocco, you suck.  You suck, Rocco.  Shut up.  O&A, he doesn't stop.  Oh, is that classic.  I certainly... 
[02:02:30]  It sounded like Rocco was on the air at that point.  Oh, I want to hear the other end of that so bad.  We'll get it.  Did he hang up?  Did he...  Or...  Who knows?  He might have gotten hit in the face.  Yeah, the phone might have got punched out.  No, Psycho Tim gets in trouble all the time in Boston, so...  He's worse than Mark?  He was probably getting thrown out of the place, or he decided to start fighting.  Wait, the phone's coming back.  He's worse than Mark?  Hmm?  Is he worse than Mark?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah, in a different way.  He's a scrapper, huh?  Oh, he's a big-time scrapper. 
[02:03:00]  He is not afraid to get right in the crap.  Right in the crap.  The difference is, Tim loves fighting.  I like him.  I've never seen Mark fight.  We've all seen Tim fight.  Tim loves to fight.  He loves to throw down.  Uh, Jimmy Norton.  Hey, what's up, man?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, what's up, bro?  Yeah, what's going on?  Uh, I'm in Cleveland.  Uh, you know what Tim should do after he yells to Rocco?  Just tell him to order $800 worth of liquor and throw $50 on the table.  Very good, bro.  Yeah, sure, change the check.  Whatever.  He just...  See how he earns it, though? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, he earned it now, man.  I'll buy him a $300 any time now.  He's an animal.  I have to keep this brief, because I have to go back to the hotel and get right...  I have to take a dump, too.  I have a yam-sized log ready to ruin me, so I have, like, three minutes on the air.  Turtle head poking out?  Uh, no.  It's going to come out sideways, so I think the torso is about to come out.  Now, uh...  Translation, he has nothing for the Opie and Anthony show to have.  Oh.  Nothing.  How was your trip?  I know you have problems with your flight a lot.  Uh, no, I didn't, actually.  It was a fine flight.  Okay, how's your room? 
[02:04:00]  Excellent.  Excellent room?  Okay, then, uh, there's no reason to talk to you.  No, I just wanted to check in, and, uh, Uncut producer called me, so I'm like, yeah, I'll  call in and say hello for a second, but, uh...  How's the, uh, how's the staff at Extreme Radio?  Uh, the three people that are here are excellent.  They have one set of headphones in this entire building.  Oh, really?  See, that's probably why they couldn't have us.  We need three sets of headphones.  It's in our rider.  That's right.  Yeah.  So I have nothing to say today that's remotely amusing or interesting.  All right.  Then, then go have fun, Jimmy.  All right, guys.  Good luck, Jim.  Hold on, there's a big problem in Boston, so we gotta let you go, Jim. 
[02:04:30]  All right, enjoy.  I know the code.  Believe me.  Go ahead.  Good luck, Jim.  Hey, Jim, kill him tonight, and, uh, we'll see you Monday, all right?  Yes.  All right, man.  All right, good.  Let's go to, uh, Psycho Tim.  Tim!  That's not a big problem.  They got more ONA listeners in there than they got Rocco listeners.  Oh, really?  One kid came over to me, and he was like, ONA sucks, and I turned around and said, what?  And he goes, no, I'm sorry, man.  Nice holly hat.  Just, just don't hit me.  I'm like, get out of my face, kid.  Screaming at God, and it's like, they just ignore me, because what are they going to say  to me?  The kid's like, you guys are still out. 
[02:05:00]  Tim, Tim, Tim.  Your cell phone's blowing up.  Can I, let me ask you something, though.  Uh, was he on the air when you did that?  Yeah, he was.  That's right, I was trying not to swear for you guys, but, whatever.  No, you know what?  There's a couple curses in there, it's all right.  I'll tell you something, we have, uh, we have a delay, so there's no problem.  They don't, so, as far as I know.  He, he, he, he stopped, he started talking to me for like, five seconds, and then he realized  it was me, and he just turned his head and started talking to me.  Oh, look at him.  Tim, you're incredible, man.  He had nothing to say.  He has nothing. 
[02:05:30]  That was awesome.  What are you going to do?  First of all, when I got to ask him over, and I just, I stared at him like I was going to knock  his face in, and then, and you wouldn't, you would knock his face in, no problem.  Hey, hold on a second, Tim.  We got Jared on the phone from Boston.  What's up?  Jared, but, uh, it's, uh, me from Boston up here.  I was, uh, I heard Tim railing on Rocco, and I'm like, oh my God, I wonder if they're  on the air.  So I flip over to AF, and all I hear is, Rocco, you suck, and then, bam, dumps right to the  commercial.  Ah, what a bunch of pussies.  Once again, they can't handle it.  What a bunch of pussies. 
[02:06:00]  Dave Douglas probably has a standing order.  If Rocco is out, and, uh, Opie and Anthony's people come over, you are to jump right to  commercial.  Faggots.  Wow, there's some edgy radio.  You guys can handle it.  Yeah, these guys are stupid.  Like, last year I was in a blood drive, so it was boring in there, but it's a bar.  Unless you're sitting here and dragging it.  Right.  I just keep attacking them.  Good.  There you go.  Buzz, what's up?  Hey, you guys get sick or tear them off my ass, man.  I'm trying to do fake radio.  All right, Buzz. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, see how he deals with real situations?  You know, Psycho Tim comes up, starts giving him some smack, and, uh, he deals with a real  situation by just dumping out the commercial.  There you go.  There's some good real radio.  What happened to all the times, uh, he would fake a situation that would happen, uh, on the  air?  You know?  Maybe fake a fight of, uh, what, here comes Maddie's chick, and she's pissed.  What happened with that?  Why don't you dump the commercial when that happens?  Because it's fake.  Hey! 
[02:07:00]  Hey, Tim, you going back in?  Yeah, I'm going back in.  Oh, you want to hear it?  Yeah.  Yeah, I can think of it.  He's only on the air for, like, three minutes every afternoon anyways, because he's horrible.  He's in between play and Metallica, you know?  Well, that's what it is.  Dave, uh, has so much faith in him that he's totally cut down, uh, his talking time and  just makes him play a lot of music.  And then they play, uh, promo saying, bragging about how they play more music than everybody  else.  Yeah, they play more music because their jocks have nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing to say.  Nothing to say.  I was on the phone.  I was going to say, I'm like, you're just trying to talk trash about two radio people 
[02:07:30]  that are nasty syndicated in 15 cities.  Like, what are you going to say, Rocko?  You're a carter field.  You know, I mean, what are you going to say, you're handing out a t-shirt to the Yankees,  the Yankees suck t-shirt.  Hey, shut up.  I'm syndicated.  I'm in Boston and Worcester.  My show's heard in two cities.  Two cities, Boston.  Well, sort of Boston.  That's a little staticky.  You can only hear it at high points with the radio. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Tim, hold on a sec.  Ben has something.  AAF is such a pathetic radio station that actually at BCN, it was staticky, so they had to have  someone out on the way out by Worcester tape it, so they're going to try and call us in  a few minutes and play it.  Oh, good.  I got to hear that.  I got to hear that.  All right.  Jimmy.  Yeah, what's up, bro?  Sorry, Jimmy.  We're fighting wars on multiple fronts here.  Yeah, we're in like, we're fighting wars in three cities today, so.  Hey, when are you going to come see us?  Where are you right now?  I'm actually on my way down to San Diego. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  They're going to jump down at Tijuana for $60 around the world to stop in Cleveland.  You got to see where they bring the donkey in and do the check in, TJ?  Well, I'm going to this place called the Chicago Bar.  It's like, you know, for $60, you get around the world to stop in Cleveland, and you know  what Cleveland is, right?  That's the dirt button.  The dirt button.  The dirty penny.  Penny.  Guys, I just want to call and say, hey, I haven't been back there in a while. 
[02:09:00]  I just want to check in.  But, you know, I'm still alive.  All right, cool.  Cool, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  We'd love to see you soon, bro.  See you.  All right, it's breaking up.  Jimmy Schubert.  Very, very, very funny guy.  Jimmy Schubert.  Tim.  Yeah, I'm going back in.  All right, he's going back in.  I'll call you back.  All right, he'll call us back.  Tim is a psychopath.  Yeah, I like him, man.  Isn't he great?  He has no fear.  This guy has no fear.  He don't care.  Does he look like Mark? 
[02:09:30]  He doesn't have the fake balls like the gang at AF.  This guy is the real deal.  Does he look like Mark?  He's bigger.  Is he?  He's bigger.  He's gray.  He's scrappy.  He's scrappy.  Mark is, like, psychotic, and so is Tim, but Tim's psychotic and loves to fight.  He'll back it up with some thrown punches, you know?  He don't care.  Cool.  God, they are such pussies.  Hey, why don't you come over here?  Oh, we better go right to commercials.  Quick, go to commercial.  I can't take it.  You're going to act like a man. 
[02:10:00]  Dave hasn't told me how to handle this situation yet.  Dave, what do I do?  They're rooting right remote.  When are you going to teach me how to handle this, Dave?  Oh, my God.  Rocko is on the line 8, Opie.  Oh, really?  Rocko.  Rockole.  Help me, Anthony.  What's the matter?  Oh, and they got fans down here.  I don't know how to handle it.  I don't know what to do.  Sounds like a constipated dice. 
[02:10:30]  Sounds like a line from...  It sounds like you're from the Pope of Greenwich Village.  They tuck my cup, Charlie.  Shut up, Opie.  Hey, you're going to do it all day.  We need material.  We're at break right now.  We dumped out so I could call you.  Every music doesn't have anything good on there.  Well, Schlockhole, you just hold on, and Tim will help you out with some lines.  Yeah, Tim will be...  He's going right after you again.  I'm afraid of that little psycho. 
[02:11:00]  He's crazy, man.  Hey, seriously, I'm really afraid of him.  Hey, if you're into madcap humor, go down to Copperfields and check out Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim is now making an appearance at Copperfields, Anthony.  I don't care.  I'll box him, and then I'll box you, fool.  Before the Yankee Red Sox game.  All right, bro.  All right, later, fool.  Bye.  Yeah, Psycho Tim doing an appearance at Copperfields, Anthony.  Yeah.  Right by Fenway. 
[02:11:30]  Hot Soup from Pennsylvania saying,  Would you mind telling us what the hell Psycho Tim was screaming?  I just heard,  Oh, Mo, Mo, Mo, Rocco, you suck.  Oh, Mo, Mo, O and A.  Oh, Mo, Mo, Mo.  Well, no, that's what we heard, too.  Yeah, film the parts.  You've got to read between the lines here and realize he's totally ripping them apart.  And they dumped to commercials.  Rocco's a fag.  Dave, what do I do?  Yeah, Dave, I can see the actual conversation.  You know, we always kid around, but I'm sure it was like, 
[02:12:00]  Dave, yeah, Dave.  Yeah, it's Rocco.  Look, uh, yeah, I don't know what to do down here, man.  Yeah, well, these guys are down here giving me crap.  What do I do?  Just ignore them, Rocco.  Ignore them?  Yeah, they'll go away.  All right, well.  You're bigger than those two.  I'll tell you what.  I'm going to do even shorter breaks.  Is that okay, Dave?  That would be a good idea, Rocco.  All right, play a bunch, you know, sweepers into music and stuff.  And, uh, just go to me.  I'm going to call you when you can go to me when I think it's safe. 
[02:12:30]  Well, let me call my wife to see what she wants me to do.  Yeah, she's very beautiful, Dave.  Your wife.  Am I kissing enough ass?  No.  Rocco, you can never kiss enough ass.  Yeah, I know, Dave.  You're beautiful.  I like your 70s gay porno mustache.  That's great.  Dave, can you come down here and cuddle with me?  Can you hold me and tell me I'm okay?  And that you love me, Dave? 
[02:13:00]  I can't believe they got me.  Rocco, just play 12 songs in a row and we'll figure it out.  Can you play 13 so I don't have to say anything?  13, okay.  Dave, could you come down here and bring your teats so I can suck?  Oh, Dave, I need to suck.  Let's go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[02:13:30]  Hi, this is Rob from the Interest of New Hampshire.  And I just want to say a big FU to that black-eating bimbo who's been on the line a couple of days.  But, look, you know, some of us actually have this sick, twisted, bizarro fetish of, you know, stuff spurting out everywhere.  You know, and for you to make sure, don't take a picture of my face because I don't want anybody seeing God to be my parents.  It's like, look, you know, you're getting in front of like 30 people in a room and squirting your bimbo into a homeless guy's face. 
[02:14:00]  And you're worried about somebody noticing you.  Let's see.  Considering you breasted your kids until they're, what, 50?  I think we'll notice you walking down the street when you have Bob Hope attached to your ****.  So this is a big FU to you.  Show your boobs.  If you're going to show your boobs, show your face.  Just a huge T-F-ing F-U to you.  Next message.  Yeah, Alex, I'm a big FU out with Jim Norton.  Hey, Jim, ever since you started that funny hanging up prank, me and my friends can't get a conversation anywhere. 
[02:14:30]  I think you've got a big senior, hey, Jim, FU.  Hey, Jim.  End of message.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opin' Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opin' Anthony Show.  Psycho Tim, what's going on, bro?  I went to the kid and he started talking to the mic and I ran over to attack him, but I realized he was only doing local announcements. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, he's just doing it through the PA.  Yeah, so I was like, he's like, I kind of felt like an idiot because I really wasn't able to be left in the bar.  Oh, there's no one left in the bar.  You know, so there's like me and like five guys, I'm screaming at him, and this dude's like, then I can listen to what he says.  He's like, you know, we're big easy this weekend, ladies night.  I'm going, oops, he's not really broadcasting right now. 
[02:15:30]  You know, you're like a pit bull.  You don't know when to strike or when to hang back.  Well, I forgot to tell you guys that one Patriots game last year, I was walking, actually with my girlfriend, we're going to, I don't know what game it was, and they left the AAF van completely unattended.  Of course, I had to go back to my car and get the wild stickers and come back and wow the van, but I'm crazy.  I don't have, I didn't have a camera, though, like an idiot.  So right now, I'm double parked, and I realize that I'm parked in front of the AAF van. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  I didn't even notice they had done that, and they had like three guys standing around the van, just making sure that no one touched it.  I'm sure, yeah, at this point.  So they had to pay a guy to come out and do it, like the guy like, you watch this bumper, and you watch this bumper.  Well, great.  Make sure no one is fixed as any stickers to this vehicle.  Well, great job today, dude.  Yeah, great job, man.  Man, I can't understand only five people as you're broadcasting live.  That's a little weird, huh?  Oh, well.  No, but he's syndicated.  You know how that is.  There you go.  The O&A Army on their way to Slobberfield to get Rock Hall. 
[02:16:30]  Tell Tim backup is on the way.  Backup on the way, Tim.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  I'll be there.  I guess you have to run downtown.  I'm coming right back.  All right.  Copperfields.  Everyone party before the Red Sox-Yankees game.  Actually, I think the game has started, right?  Yeah, 6 o'clock start.  And, Anthony, I did not hear one Yankee suck chat.  No, it'll happen.  I haven't heard one yet.  I was lucky.  And we had a lot of fans in that bar, I guess, huh? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, well, we all just kind of, I think either they're going to the game or Rock Hall sucks, obviously.  All right.  All right, Tim, check in if anything's going on.  All right.  Sounds good.  Backup on the way, though.  Okay, good.  Good.  Oh, my God.  You don't care, I'm telling you.  He doesn't.  That's great.  Guy does not care.  Bravo, Psycho Tim.  All right.  You want to talk about, what word can we use for the junk today, man?  Um, schlong.  How about mule?  Mule, good. 
[02:17:30]  He won't dump out a mule, right?  No.  You have a mule?  Yeah, mule.  I have a goat.  Yeah, mule.  Goat.  God, was she, uh...  This is a sick story.  What was this on, 48 Hours or something?  Mule.  Mule.  Mule.  Mule.  Mule.  Uh, we got the story in front of us.  You actually saw this piece on TV, eh?  Yeah, this is on, uh, Ripley's.  Oh, Ripley's.  Ripley's, believe it or not.  Yep.  And, uh, yeah, a little operation. 
[02:18:00]  Most of the crap on Ripley's is a, uh, is a bore fest.  Yeah, well, it's turned more into, uh, a gross-out show than it is actual, uh, well, believe it or not, is, uh, is supposed to be disgusting stuff.  Right.  But then there was the, uh, oh, Guinness Book of World Records show.  You ever see that one?  Yeah, yeah.  And that's just trying to gross people out.  They had some good ones in the beginning.  Yeah, but it's not world record to have the guy with the snap-on nose or something like that, you know?  The snap-on face.  It's like, yeah, he's got a snap-on face.  He set a world record for what? 
[02:18:30]  All right, I gotta, I gotta take it back, because when we were in Boston, we turned on Ripley's.  Yeah.  Did you see the guy that had some flesh-eating, uh, disease that completely took the front of his face away?  Yeah.  And then they constructed a brand-new fate?  Anthony, like this.  Lost both eyes, all the way down the nose, barely had part of his top lip left.  Oh, thank God he could still kiss.  Huge, huge, just circle.  Yeah.  Everything gone, flesh-eating virus. 
[02:19:00]  All of a sudden, he just happened to have, like, what looked like maybe a pimple or a little rash.  Oh, oh, what's this?  Got a little worse, right?  So he goes to the doctor.  Within a week, his face is gone.  Oh, my God, it ate his face.  It ate away everything.  It's some rare, rare, uh, uh, flesh-eating disease.  These, guys from Kentucky, uh, and the wife, God bless her, man, stayed with the guy.  And, uh, they, they made a new face for him with fake sunglasses.  Snap on his face. 
[02:19:30]  It was, uh, that was a little rough to look at.  Oh, I'm getting nauseous.  I think I would rather have the, you know, just the face missing.  I don't know.  Because I saw that the other night.  It looked like, like a big ice cream scooper had scooped out, like, his face.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it was just a hollow cavity.  And she's there, uh, just kind of, uh, uh, sopping up all the fluids.  Stop it.  Because he has no nose.  So he just leaks.  Yeah, he leaks everywhere, and she's just sopping it up.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:00]  This lady's a saint.  Like, saliva and mucus and everything.  Whatever.  It just comes oozing out from underneath the snap-on.  It was sick, eh.  It was sick.  A wet, dry pack.  God bless her.  They were a happy couple one day.  Next thing you know, this guy's losing his face.  No face.  There's some weird, uh, plush-eating disease.  God, that's F-top.  Happens to one in maybe like 10 million people.  He's the guy.  Jesus.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks for picking me.  That sucks to be you.  Wow. 
[02:20:30]  Well, sucks to be this guy, too.  He was featured on, um, the, uh, Ripley's.  Ripley's, right.  Believe it or not.  All right.  It says here, uh, the patient was pleading with the doctors.  The man said he had cancer.  But after the operation, there was only two centimeters of his mule left.  Oh, God.  Let's see.  Two centimeters.  Yeah.  How big is two centimeters?  Everyone, put your fingers together and try to figure out what two centimeters is.  I would say it's about this.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Look at this.  A little nub.  The space between the tip of your finger and your first knuckle.  Wow.  He's hung.  You're going to give him that much?  I think it's less than that, even.  Not two centimeters.  I'm thinking it's a nail.  You think?  No.  That, a nail is about one centimeter.  Yeah.  All right.  A centimeter is less than an inch.  All right.  So, he had two centimeters of his mule left.  He, uh, didn't want to be without his tool.  So, he agreed to sacrifice his middle finger, Opie. 
[02:21:30]  He, um, he got an operation.  Oh.  What?  He got an operation.  That's going to be funny if he gives someone a finger.  I thought that was funny.  All right.  Let's see.  He, um.  Don't forget your waitress.  In the beginning, he thought it was because of the heavy rain that drenched him.  Several days later, he noticed ulcers on his junk.  Yeah.  Here's the deal.  Well, because of the heavy rain, he was really cold all the time.  So, he thought he just caught something from the rain. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah.  So, I thought he thought he was chafed because of the heavy rain.  What is he, walking around in the nude?  I don't know.  No, I mean, like, like, his pants got all wet and you walk in wet pants.  It kind of rubs.  I don't know.  All right.  It became very painful to use the toilet.  He noticed ulcers on his mule.  On his mule, yeah.  Uh, David started a self-treatment course.  Oh, that's smart.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you find ulcers on your mule.  Just take some herbal medicines. 
[02:22:30]  However, this didn't help.  He then went to the hospital.  The doctors diagnosed him with cancer of the mule.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Cancer of your junk.  They told him an operation was vital and it needed it as soon as possible.  They promised they would only cut a little bit, David recollects.  Uh, but when I looked at what was under the bandage, doctors and nurses rushed in to settle me down. 
[02:23:00]  They said I'd be able to, uh, he'd be able to, uh, take a leak.  Yeah.  With no pain.  Good excuse.  What about the rest?  I'm a man.  I'm only 60.  I'm still attracted to women.  The doctors took offense.  They said my claims were stupid.  They saved my life.  People close to me noticed the difference in me right away.  Although I did not expose the details of the operation I had to go through.  They were all bugging me with questions like, what was wrong and why was I so gloomy all the time? 
[02:23:30]  Because you have a two-centimeter mule.  Of course you're gloomy.  With probably no yam bag.  It's just there.  Oh, God.  No, yeah, you got your yam bag, right?  Because that was fine.  What's worse, two centimeters with a, uh, normal-sized yam bag or two centimeters without the yam bag?  Both bad.  Uh, I gave way to despair.  I started living like a robot. 
[02:24:00]  I learned about Dr. Kuzinov's clinic, incidentally.  The specialists of plastic surgery clinic in the city of, uh, wherever, somewhere in the Republic of Georgia in Russia, are like miracle workers.  They bring disabled people back to life.  Uh, Iva, a surgeon at the clinic, said the material he used in his clinic, uh, most often is a finger.  Wait, but man, you're not...  So now you're hung like this?  There's not much there. 
[02:24:30]  Well, he said he could help him with his problem by taking one of his fingers off his hand.  The doctor warned him about the possible risks, but, uh, David was ready for anything.  Yeah, when you got the two-centimeter schlong, you're pretty much open for anything.  Yeah, I got, I got a pretty, uh, open mind here.  Yeah, whatever it takes, Doc.  It took 15 hours to perform the operation.  David's middle finger, because it's the longest, uh, the new body part would be 17 to 20 centimeters long.  Now, hold on.  Would you go for the middle finger or the thumb? 
[02:25:00]  I would go for the thumb.  Mm-hmm.  I've heard thickness much more important than, than the length, Anthony.  Well, they, they did, uh, something about that, too.  They cut off his middle finger, they turned the finger inside out, and started making a new mule out of it.  Frankenpecker.  Then I heard what they also did.  They took skin from his, uh, arm.  Yeah.  Yeah, and his leg.  And his leg.  And fattened it up.  And fattened it up with skin beneath the skin of the finger. 
[02:25:30]  So it's layers and layers like a yodel.  Like a roll of paper towels.  It's got like a yodel.  Yeah, roll of paper towels.  And they, uh, stick the skin in there, and it fattens up the finger.  Quicker, huh, bro?  Uh, he said his new mule was very fine.  Even more, a man would be able, uh, to do it any time, any place, and as many times as he wished.  The doctors advised him that such a mule would not only give pleasure to the woman, a man would also enjoy it. 
[02:26:00]  Moreover, a finger-made mule is, um, very good to use since it could be bent on the phalange joints, hitting those vital areas.  Ah.  Opie.  G-spot junk.  The bone is left in the finger.  Now, what about the nail?  They had to get, well, they had to take the nail out, right?  I don't know.  I'm also hearing that this functions like a regular tool.  Like, uh, he could complete.  It took hours for them to, uh, put the nerve endings from the finger and attach it to the nerve endings in his lower abdomen, where your normal, uh, mule nerves connect. 
[02:26:30]  So this guy could finish.  Well, he's got to have some kind of sensation, and I would assume that with the two centimeters that are left, that you could probably finish.  With the nerve endings in there and the pushing that you could do on the two centimeters, you could probably finish that way.  Like Spider-Man.  But then the, the, yeah.  Then running the urethra through the finger. 
[02:27:00]  Throwing web.  So he could use it.  Yeah, really, it is.  His finger just flops out.  What if it pops off?  It's enough.  Got to watch that language.  Yeah, come on.  Can't use, kids are listening.  You can't use that word in that context.  I could call you that, but you couldn't, uh, yeah.  See how it works?  Very fine line.  Um, yeah, you could bend it.  After one month, David came back to the doctor, shining with his smile. 
[02:27:30]  He was so happy.  Currently, David is planning to get married.  And, of course, the good doctor is going to be a guest of honor.  Is it true that, uh, when they ran this on Ripley's, they made the guy put on, like, a Speedo?  Yeah, well, after the operation, they showed him, uh, now.  And he was on the beach.  And since it's, uh, over there, you know, in Europe, wherever the hell he was, it looked like he was in Greece.  Yeah.  Uh, he was on a beach somewhere. 
[02:28:00]  Uh, they showed him in a Speedo with a little lump in his pants.  His lumpy finger.  And the operation's called, uh, adedictomy.  Yeah, adedictomy.  That's what it was.  Adedictomy.  An adedictomy.  Adedictomy.  That's one word.  Don't dump out.  What does it mean?  They don't like, um...  I don't know.  It, like, I'm, I'm right now, I'm grabbing my middle finger, right?  I see what you're doing.  I'm holding my finger up.  I'm, I'm making a tube out of my other hand, and I'm shoving it in and out of the tube very quickly. 
[02:28:30]  I learned something very early in my, uh, sexual career.  Girls don't like when you take a finger and just jam away.  Right?  They don't like that.  You don't just jam away with a finger.  You don't just take it and jam.  Wack, wack, wack, wack, wack, wack.  It's like, what the hell is that?  Anthony.  What?  Have you read the FCC manual lately?  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, okay.  I just said you can't take your finger and jam away.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That's fine.  All right.  That passes muster.  So I would think that would kind of be the same thing as just the finger jamming away.  But maybe a fattened up finger, maybe a big fat man's finger is different.  Look how I'm just doing this.  I don't know why.  I'm so fascinated.  Dr. Eric is on the line.  He brought in four fingers even worse when you're jamming away, especially when you make 
[02:29:30]  a fist, dip it in lard, and slam it home.  We got the cancer doctor on the line.  The doctor that brought in cancer for us on Tuesday.  Dr. Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  You know, when I was looking through stuff, I was thinking, should I bring one?  No, stop it.  You have one?  Well, I probably could have gotten it because you wind up doing penectomies, unfortunately,  more frequently than you would like to.  Whoa! 
[02:30:00]  But I thought it made me just a bit much.  Dr. Eric, tell me you have removed the guy's tool.  I never have, no.  Have you witnessed this?  I have.  What do they do?  Well, I mean, you have to remove...  Once you remove it, then you have to make sure that you've cut off all of the blood that's  going to that area.  Yeah, we actually have to, the way we have to say it is the mule.  I know even though it's medical terms...  Oh, really?  ...that you're talking about, we still just have to call it the mule.  Okay, so the mule sounds ridiculous. 
[02:30:30]  You have to cut off the blood supply that used to go there?  Yeah, or else you'll have continued bleeding.  Oh, now let's see, let's say that the blood that normally goes there so it can function  as a device of reproduction, you don't cut the blood supply off, but the unit's gone.  Then, if something happened that would have normally gotten you aroused, that blood would  just rush to the wound and break it open?  It very well could.  Why don't you just...  It's a gusher!  Why don't you just surgically put a balloon down there? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, it could all of a sudden go...  Just like...  Like a little balloon?  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  What type of surgeries are there now for making up for the lost mule?  Well, I mean, there aren't definitely implants that you can put in.  Yeah, but what if it's gone?  If it's gone, I mean, I'm not a urological surgeon, so I don't know exactly what they have  in terms of cutting edge, but I mean, in terms of using a finger, a lot of times what you 
[02:31:30]  can do is, you wouldn't just use the finger either, because that would cause deformity  to the hand.  You actually would use what's known as the whole ray.  So you take the finger going down all the way to the wrist.  Whoa, get out of here.  So you could, you know...  That's the cut they showed on the wrist.  Oh, so they cut it down to the wrist, and then what, they sew his hand back together?  So that it doesn't look ridiculous, so you don't look like, you know, the penguin or  something like that.  Holy smoke.  So they're taking the hand, the knuckle...  Wow, he's got a nice heart.  Exactly! 
[02:32:00]  Didn't play out so bad.  Maybe not the way you want it, but...  Screw it!  Take it to the elbow, Doc!  And I can't do it for evaluation.  It may look a little funny, but wow, he's hard.  Look at that thing.  He coils it up.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  You know something?  At that point, you just got to go the distance, have everything removed, turn into a chick,  and let your friends bang you.  All right, Doc.  Just give up.  All right, you guys.  I want to thank you once again for bringing cancer into us.  Oh, no problem.  Yeah, I had to stay in my apartment overnight. 
[02:32:30]  Great.  A bunch of people in Washington got very pissed off that we had cancer on the show.  Um, I could see why.  That may not be the most health-sanitary thing.  No, it's funny, and, you know, I truly don't give a crap, but there's always another side to this.  Yeah, we had cancer on the show, and we respected cancer for the most part, right, Anthony?  We weren't...  I believe so.  I wouldn't even look cancer.  I wouldn't look at cancer.  Yeah, you wouldn't even look at it.  We weren't too silly with cancer. 
[02:33:00]  No.  But, uh, yeah, so we get complaint calls and complaint letters.  Yeah, I heard the thing to Ken Stevens.  Yeah, Ken had a few calls, and they all came from Washington for some reason.  Be that as it may, huh?  You know, I read the email every day, and I swear to you, and trust me, I don't care,  but a bunch of girls, because they heard that on the show,  just like Jim Norton Quinton's smoking after that guy had the lump in his throat,  girls went right to their dock and got the mammograms.  Yeah, so it's a, I mean, not to spin it as a public service, obviously, it's a radio thing, but... 
[02:33:30]  But there's always another side to that.  I mean, they were so freaked out, they called their doctors right away.  Yeah.  So there you go.  All right, bro.  All righty, guys.  Thanks, Dr. Erick.  Take care.  Bye.  There you go.  What do you do about the cancer of the radio on from 3 to 7 at AAF?  How do you remove that?  Oh, you send Psycho Tim.  Dr. Psycho Tim.  Anthony.  Yes.  We've got to get the awesome Garrett in here to pick today's Wesley Willis Song of the Day. 
[02:34:00]  Also, this is really cool.  We've been giving away OzFest tickets all this week, man.  This is for the Washington Show.  Right.  And we've got some more tickets to give away right now.  Winner receives a pair of tickets before he can buy them to OzFest at Nissan Pavilion on Saturday, July 6th.  Hey, man, if you could road trip, give us a call.  I'm assuming, you know, most people from Washington will call for this, but if you could road trip, go for it.  This is the first day to the OzFest tour.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow at 12 noon at all Ticketmaster locations, charged by phone or online at Ticketmaster.com or NissanPavilion.com. 
[02:34:30]  Another what?  We'll give another couple pairs of tickets away right now at OzFest.  Give us a call on the national line, 866-277-4WOW for OzFest.  Where's Awesome Garrett?  What's up?  Hey, bro.  Look how awesomely you're going to pick this song now.  Hey, how's the show sound today?  Sounds pretty awesome.  Pretty awesome, indeed.  Pretty awesome.  Awesome Garrett.  Thank you, Awesome Garrett.  Thank you.  What song are we going to be hearing?  And we did it without Jimmy Norton today. 
[02:35:00]  Wow.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Yes, he is.  That clip's awesome.  Isn't it?  You hate it, and we all know it.  All right, what's today's Wesley Willis song of the day?  Let's go with Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Is it good?  Yeah.  All right.  Is it good?  There was a man named Kurt Cobain.  He played music.  He played grunge music.  Well, it's got to be the same format, right?  Yeah.  The talking, the slight musical interlude, then the repetitive chorus. 
[02:35:30]  Hey, Wesley Willis.  Yes.  Do you have a song about the guy that has a finger for a mule?  There was a man that had cancer of the mule.  He went to the doctor.  The doctor said, I've got to cut your mule off and left him with two centimeters.  He was very disturbed and perturbed.  They cut off his finger and made a mule out of his finger.  Mule out of his finger.  Mule out of his finger.  Mule out of his finger.  Mule out of his finger. 
[02:36:00]  Rock over London.  Rock on Chicago.  Blockbuster video.  It's the way to go.  I put you on the spot and you came through.  Oh, come on.  Those are the easiest songs to write.  I know.  All right.  Here's the Wesley Willis song of the day.  It's the Kurt Cobain song.  Yes.  All right.  Let's rock it to Russia.  All right.  All right.  Kurt Cobain was a rock singer for Nirvana.  He rocked the United States by flying all over the country and playing that rock and roll. 
[02:36:30]  Here's a good singer.  Here's my rock star.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Woo.  Nirvana's 1991 Nevermind album, which has no more than two million copies, turned Kurt Cobain into a spokesman first generation.  It is a matter with which he was never comfortable.  He can really rock like a magicist. 
[02:37:00]  He can really play that rock and roll.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  There's the echo.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Oh, the music.  Upon its release last September, in utero, shots to number one on the pop chart.  There were signs of trouble when the band played two concerts at the Aragon in Chicago.  The first show was a tramp. 
[02:37:30]  It was a knockout.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Here it comes.  Rock over London.  Rock over Chicago.  XIMEX.  It takes a licky and keeps on ticking.  Oh, something a little different today.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice.  All right.  Great.  Wesley Willis' song of the day. 
[02:38:00]  Kurt Cobain.  And now we've got to go right to the FU line.  The FU line, very busy today for some reason.  If you need the number, go to opieandanthony.com.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Hi, I want to give a big FU to everyone I work with for leaving me here by myself in the office.  I've got to freaking answer all the goddamn phone lines and freaking do my work and everybody else's job at the same time.  F*** you all.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big FU out to Wesley Willis and the chicken cow and I have that goddamn song stuck in my f***ing head. 
[02:38:30]  So, uh, rock on Chicago.  Rock on over London.  Peace out.  And we wrecked as a champion.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big F*** you to my boss.  Look, you piece of F***.  Just because you're all high and mighty and you make much more money than anybody else doesn't mean we're low-life scumbag F*** balls.  Because if it wasn't for us, your F***ing company wouldn't run.  You just remember that next time you call me in your office to tell me about something stupid and waste my F***ing time, 
[02:39:00]  when I can be out doing more important things,  by getting you your next boat or car, making the money for you, you piece of crap.  F*** you.  End of message.  Let's rock.  You guys are able.  You sound like a fruity stick in the mud.  I hate you.  Sew up that worthless slot.  It's time to play what do we learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:39:30]  And Ed's going to get fooled.  I see it.  Scott, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show today?  Scott.  Scott.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  What did you learn?  I learned that on Monday, when you guys go into the studio, your microphones won't stink.  Nice little callback, huh?  That's very good.  Very nice.  Have a good weekend.  You pay close attention, my friend. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Take care.  Anthony, before we really get into what did we learn today,  we've waited long enough.  We want to say goodbye to Rochester.  Rochester, bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Anthony, Rochester's been stringing us along for two weeks.  They don't want the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Right.  It's very obvious.  But they don't know how to handle it, because I think they're a little scared of us, what 
[02:40:30]  we might do.  Oh, and well, you should be.  Well, you should be.  We've waited long enough.  Ken promised me, he said, if they don't give us an answer today at five, that starting  Monday, we would try to find another station in Rochester to broadcast to.  Oh, we will.  A station that will pick us up live, by the way, just like Buffalo did.  I mean, it's the same people, basically.  I lived in both cities.  There's not much difference.  Yeah.  And if we could do so well in Buffalo, we could do just as well in Rochester with on a station 
[02:41:00]  that supports the program.  So, as of Monday, we're going to find a new home for the O.P. and Anthony Show in Rochester,  and it will be my personal pleasure, and O.P.'s, to then hand it right back to the station  that we are currently heard on, as far as right now goes, because we won't be there on Monday.  And I can't believe that John McRae and Kevin LeGrette from WCMF in Rochester didn't have 
[02:41:30]  the balls to personally call us and tell us, first off, that there was a problem.  Yep.  John McRae, I was up there on vacation, you know, hanging with Brother Weiss.  Brother Weiss is beyond pissed about this, by the way, in Rochester.  I was at a Brother Weiss appearance.  John McRae, the program director, was two feet away from me.  He didn't have the balls to tell me that there was any problem whatsoever.  Of course not.  And then I ended up doing Brother Weiss' show when I was up in Rochester.  I was in WCMF, hanging out, walking the hallways, walking in and out of offices, 
[02:42:00]  and Kevin LeGrette didn't have the balls to take me aside and say,  hey, man, we've got big problems here.  You know, I don't know what to do, and this is what I'm thinking.  Slick.  Sackless corporate shill.  You'll pay.  Have fun.  And I want to thank Fred Flintstone for effing us once again.  The guy that fired us after the mayor prank in Boston was the one who terminated our contracts. 
[02:42:30]  Douchebag.  You know what's a lot harder to sell in this show?  No ratings.  Because that's what you're going to have in Afternoon Drive.  He terminated our show in Boston, Anthony.  Then, boy, luck has it.  He gets to work for the same company we do.  Yeah.  How does that work?  And he's in charge of a lot of these media market stations.  Mm-hmm.  And he's in charge of our Austin affiliate, our Seattle affiliate, and our Rochester affiliate.  Uh-huh.  Guess what all three of those have in common? 
[02:43:00]  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Hey, Fred Flintstone.  Who's like, man, you know, okay, I would really like to talk to the guy someday and, you know, make sure there's no...  So that's where we stand currently.  Are we allowed to say that word?  No.  I'm sure they dumped out of that.  Well, I don't forget when someone terminates me.  No, we can't be pals.  And we're going to sit down like, ha, ha, ha, hey. 
[02:43:30]  Those are good old days.  Oh, and some phone calls are going to be made next week.  Old, old MK is going to get a little phone call.  Going to get a little phone call that says that Fred Flintstone Beloukis has no goddamn input or say as far as what happens with this show.  None.  None.  None on him.  Fred Flintstone, keep us off all your stations. 
[02:44:00]  I don't want to deal with him.  I don't want him.  I don't want to deal with him.  I don't want him having anything to do with this program.  Done.  And Kevin McGrett and John McRae, we will meet again.  You pussies.  Oh, you're going to have such a fun time competing against this show.  You are going to have a blast.  Give Rockhole a call.  Give Rockhole a call.  And you ask him how much fun he's having competing with this show.  Because now it's going to be your nightmare. 
[02:44:30]  Nightmare.  Another reason why I hate this business.  John McRae.  Hey, I really want to put out your next CD.  The whole time knowing he's dropping our show.  God damn damn from Hoboken.  Oh, Hoboken.  I learned Opie and Anthony are pizza and Rochester wants hamburger.  It's a God damn scorched callback.  Wait, listen.  You know, I want to make this perfectly clear.  They have every right to do what they're doing.  But they didn't have the balls to tell us.  Not only the balls to tell us, but then to try to string it along for no reason.  You want us.  You don't. 
[02:45:00]  Let us know.  And we will happily, we will happily move on and bite you in the ass.  And a message to Kevin LeGrette.  I know you want to be a bigwig in this company.  Let me tell you something about this company.  First of all, you should find another one.  Because the managers in this company have balls.  You have none, my friend.  Yep.  You're hung.  You probably have two centimeters like freaking middle finger tool guy.  I know for a fact, this company has a bunch of managers that have balls.  You, sir, don't have balls. 
[02:45:30]  There's my phone.  Oh, you getting a phone call, Opie?  What?  What?  Who is it?  Yeah, who's this?  Tim, we're on the air, you ass.  You run, you should know that.  Well, I'll talk to you after the show.  Is that Tim Sabian? 
[02:46:00]  Wait, wait, Tim, one other thing.  Is that Tim Sabian?  Tim Sabian.  See, now he has balls, but he doesn't have brains.  Trust me, we know he has balls.  He has the tightest slacks in the company.  We're on the air.  Tim, we know you have balls.  You don't have to wear the tight slacks.  God damn it.  Is that the funniest thing?  We're on the air.  He knows it.  He's running two of the stations we're on.  Philly and Chicago.  And he calls your personal phone when you're on the air.  Anthony, really fast. 
[02:46:30]  I got to run through some of these.  What do we learn?  So, get the hell out of here.  Yes.  Ben, we're going late.  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned Otter and D-Day are going to wake Anthony and Keith up tonight with fire extinguishers.  Fire extinguishers.  Cats and Habs, adrenal server.  Hi.  Hi, my guild.  Steve from The Gate in Jersey.  I learned it's not gay if you're too drunk to remember.  Not to throw a pancake chisel at the great white gorilla.  Awesome Garrett is not so awesome when it comes to playing you show me yours, I'll show you mine.  And Anthony's with the Cat and the Hat Gang. 
[02:47:00]  Chris from Boston.  I learned today, hey guys, today I learned three things.  I learned that Anthony went from having threesomes to joining a guild.  Schlocko is syndicated in two cities, Boston and Worcester.  And Psycho Tim rules.  Jersey Gary.  I learned today, never ever F with the frosted mini wheat.  He also learned, Opie likes poking the grizzly bear in the stomach with a short stick.  And priests are having more sex than the guys in Oz.  Yeah.  Sheep lover.  I learned today, Opie smirks when he lies.  Sheep lover also learned, archbishops can only move diagonally. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  Sheep lover again, wow.  Don't kneel in the cement.  And he also learned, if you work at a radio shack and a black guy keeps buying car antennas, he's going to beat his wife.  Brian from Philly.  Today I learned Psycho Tim cures radio cancer.  Yes.  Radio cancer.  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Bravo.  There's some great ones.  Yeah.  That's what happens, though.  We run out of time.  Yeah.  Well, a new city starting up very soon, by the way. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  See?  Go ahead.  Another huge city picking up the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  It was supposed to happen Monday, but they need another week, unfortunately.  It's a great college town, too.  Got to weed out a few things before we can settle in.  Newark?  Oh, Gorilla, real fast.  You got a plug?  Yeah, I'll be at the Pips this weekend and the Comedy Festival Sunday at Rascal.  All right.  Thank you.  Everyone go see Jeff Morris.  Anything?  What? 
[02:48:30]  Your mic wasn't on.  Oh.  I know.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  No, you didn't.  I got the light thing in front of me.  You didn't know.  Yeah.  You're a dick, too, now.  I saw your finger.  Don't grab the mouse like you're innocent.  I know.  I grabbed the mouse like I didn't push that.  Jeff, what do you need to plug?  The Pips or the...  Neither.  Nothing.  No, I'm serious, man.  Buy mini-wheats.  No, seriously.  You gave us some good radio today.  Buy mini-wheats.  Pips this weekend tonight.  Come on, somebody.  It's on his night subject. 
[02:49:00]  Look what he's doing now.  Mama, I want ninny.  That's what I'm going to be saying after he shatters my jaw.  All right.  Pips this weekend with Jeff Norris.  And the Comedy Festival Sunday.  Just freaking...  Enough, man.  You can't digest all this.  What are you going to say this all day?  Guys, have a great weekend.  We had a lot of fun this weekend.  Hell yeah.  Good seeing you.  And we got some surprises next week.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:49:30]  You know, you said that and I just got that whoosh feeling in my stomach.  Are you getting the butterflies?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Battles being waged all over the place.  If you're a faithful listener, keep your fingers crossed this weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you. </pre>
