<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from WBCN 104.1 in Boston marked their triumphant return after a three-year absence, following their firing from a previous Boston station.  The hosts began by addressing their past controversies,  recounting their rivalry with AAF/UFA, their subsequent success in New York, and the infamous stunts that led to arrests and lawsuits â€“ specifically mentioning their interference with President Clinton's motorcade and the "voyeur bus" incident featuring nude teens (which was covered by CNN).  They detailed their New York show's content, including segments like "Whip Them Out Wednesday," "Teen Week" (featuring teen pajama parties and a lesbian couch segment), and the ongoing "Best Boob Contest."  Listener calls frequently revolved around their past exploits, including the Clinton motorcade incident and the "voyeur bus"  incident.  Other listener anecdotes included a *Today* show breast-flashing incident and the story of "Wheelchair Fred," who attempted to walk after Opie's encouragement.  The hosts also shared the story of "Psycho Mark," an employee fired for arranging a sexual act on their general manager's couch as part of the "Sex for Sam" contest.  The show also highlighted their experiences at WNEW in New York, described as a "crap hole" in contrast to their previous successful rock station stint.

They discussed their "assault on the media" campaign, culminating in a stunt involving a large, profane sign during an NBC live news report.  A significant portion of the show featured  Sandy Kane, a 70-something-year-old stripper/comedian known for bizarre behavior, including showcasing her hemorrhoids and having a listener apply Preparation H; audio and video of this was reportedly available online.  The hosts played audio clips from this incident.  Other topics included a listener call recounting Opie's insensitive response to a caller discussing a death, their appearance in Penthouse magazine and their families' reactions, and  numerous listener calls focused on the rivalry between New York and Boston sports teams, particularly the Yankees and Red Sox. One caller offered a humorous comparison of women in different cities. The hosts also recounted other incidents that nearly got them fired, including a prank call to the White House while Hillary Clinton was running for Senate and various publicity stunts involving provocative signs.

The broadcast also included personal anecdotes: one host recounted a movie theater incident with loud Hispanic women, and another described a bar fight in Virginia with locals.  Jim Brewer, an SNL alumnus and friend, joined the show in the studio as a guest, along with Nick Carter.  The hosts discussed going to Atlas on Lansdowne Street after the show for drinks with Brewer before his comedy performance. The show also included behind-the-scenes details, such as discussions with the music department and humorous anecdotes about on-air notes.  Finally, the show concluded with a game called "Guess What's in My Pants," involving a female caller, Jenny, describing her pubic area's texture and sound;  followed by promotion of their website, a website with show content, and a message board described as having "freaky" content. The hosts repeatedly used vulgar and offensive language throughout the broadcast and promoted an after-show meet-up at Atlas on Lansdowne Street, along with giving away Orgy concert tickets and mentioning an upcoming appearance on NBC's XFL Game Day show.

[00:11:00]  right but now that we're doing a talk show in new york you just got to fly by the seat of your pants  and take live phone calls right so mike what else is going on i i'm kind of wondering what you did to  bill clinton oh uh yeah we could get into that yeah kind of uh interfered with his uh motorcade route  down in uh manhattan uh mike we're gonna let you go okay and we'll uh we'll discuss it all right thanks  all right how do we hang up the phones here there you go no no i'm still here all right there it is 
[00:11:30]  uh um yeah we've been uh getting ourselves in trouble ever since we left boston you would think  we would have learned by now no no we have quite a reputation we're always the uh say now pay later  kind of guys always have been and uh it got it got us booted from our uh job up here and uh we came  close a couple of times in new york but i i think if you make it through these things just kind of makes  you bigger yeah you know a lot of people uh you get their attention when you interfere with the 
[00:12:00]  president of the united states uh uh quickly we have created a ton of new bits on our radio show  and uh we discovered anthony and i that uh that teens equal ratings yeah yeah if you put and try this  at home you put the word teen in front of anything it makes it ten times more gooder ten times more  gooder try it teen but okay the word restaurant that's good teen restaurant restaurant yeah now 
[00:12:30]  it's better it's better with just the word teen and now how about this one mud wrestling cool yeah  it's good teen mud wrestling teen mud wrestling you're not missing it teen equals good all right so  with that we've done a lot of teen concept radio shows down in new york yeah we actually devote a week to  it every so often we do teen week and we have teen um teen lesbian couch bring a couch in various teen 
[00:13:00]  girls come into the studio and uh have their first experience with another woman or another teen on the  couch and the teen concept really took off people enjoy it teen pajama party was uh quite a hit that was  a good one yeah the teen uh sweet 16 birthday party was very nice no that's a little too uh young we  know of course they're uh within legal age but they are teens that's right so uh we did something called 
[00:13:30]  teen voyeur bus you want to explain the voyeur bus to the fine folks here in boston it voyeur bus it's a  big uh bus you know just like any city bus you would see except the sides are all glass  glass it's completely see-through from top to bottom the sides all glass like a rolling fish  bowl inside the voyeur bus nude girls and uh when we're involved nude teen girls so we figured hey  let's take this because uh the mayor of new york is a true tool he really wants to uh try to clean up 
[00:14:00]  new york city and make it like the disney uh store and dare i say it yeah i like the mayor of boston  more than i like the mayor of new york i will agree wholeheartedly opi yes the mayor of new york tool  mayor of boston he rocks he does right there you go so what mayor giuliani down there he he he really  sucks and uh he's been cleaning up new york it's not even a fun place to go and look at the smut anymore 
[00:14:30]  uh and this is even any new yorker will tell you this it's not a fun exciting place i used to like  going into manhattan when you thought you might die you might not make it back home and uh he's trying  to clean it up so he doesn't like nudity at all so we load up the voyeur bus with teen girls fans of  the show and uh set it off with uh our producer of the show rick uh our web guy and a couple of other 
[00:15:00]  guys stand up comics uh lewis black if you've ever watched uh the daily show on comedy central he's a  comic that does a segment every wednesday we sent him along to give commentary and the bus took off  straight down broadway the great white way manhattan headed for um city hall city hall where it would  uh where the mayor hangs out in front you would think we would leave mayors alone right right but  we took the teen voyeur bus right to city hall where the mayor was hanging out to his backyard 
[00:15:30]  basically and was it going to be a quick flyby oh no we decide the bus is going to stop in front of  city hall where giuliani is and with these glass walls and nude teens the girls will then shower  because there is a shower inside the boy always felt they were a little dirty at this point very dirty  filthy girls filthy dirty dirty girls and um so they made their way down broadway from the radio  station and uh you should tell the folks that uh on every city block there were hundreds upon hundreds 
[00:16:00]  of people with those instamatic uh cameras taking pictures the looks from the people unbelievable we  took over the city for a day yeah they couldn't believe it we were getting police escorts yeah this  was part of the problem too the nypd a couple of uh guys couple of go-getters i would say obi  decided they were gonna escort the voyeur bus full of new teens down broadway to help with the flow of  traffic as they hang out the windows of the cruiser snapping pictures but it helped out it really did it 
[00:16:30]  kept things moving because if the voyeur bus got stopped at a light people would come out of the  buildings and and out of the woodwork to slam their fists on the windows and show the girls their  junk and and and take pictures so what the cops are there to keep things moving along it made it to  city hall uh giuliani got wind of it um he was very pissed uh then we decided all right look come back  to the station we're coming back up uh up manhattan uh to the radio station this is where it got intense 
[00:17:00]  because we're like come on just come back to the station everything will be cool we had the police escort  we were what 12 blocks away from uh the studios right um taking uh in new york sixth avenue north  which at the time we had no clue was the motorcade route for bill clinton a secured road because he was  making his way uptown in manhattan and the uh the crap hit the fan out of the woodwork how many cop cars 
[00:17:30]  pulled over the the voyeur bus well there were there were a couple of cops that were escorting the  voyeur bus helping out um they peeled off when they saw the lights and cops coming from every direction  uh troopers sheriffs secret service uh swarmed on the bus stopped it pulled everyone off handcuffed  them and arrested them and took how many people on the bus uh 13 people associated with our radio show  were arrested including in case you missed it nude teens that's right nude teen girls 
[00:18:00]  arrested arrested cage heat incarcerated yeah it was a complete nightmare for the opian anthony show once  again they were run through the system printed mug shots uh the guys and girls were then separated  i'm sure those i'm sure those correctional uh officers down there the lousy screws i'm sure they  knocked a piece off of some of those teen girls and uh yeah they were all separated taken in and held 
[00:18:30]  with no charges they were held for 26 hours something like that yeah yeah and uh being the pussies that  you and i are yeah uh they came down to the station to arrest us we ran yeah yeah please i'm not built  for prison right oh i would have made uh oz look like a disney movie you ever see hbo oz yeah yeah  every week there's man ass and some type of sex going on and there's not a woman to be found so 
[00:19:00]  that happened what two months ago yeah and finally uh the charges have finally been dropped for everyone  well the girls had a cop a play they had a cop a play they just they have to just stay good for what  six months or something yeah keep their nose clean as their nose clean in the biz nose clean well uh this  story was so huge that cnn did a huge piece on it yeah you want to play the audio we brought some of our  stuff up here yeah this was from the cnn story um i'm i'm sure you know something i am sure bill 
[00:19:30]  clinton would come forward and he probably will someday and go god damn thank you boys because i got  to tell you that motorcade route is the most boring goddamn thing i've ever been on but when i saw a bus  full of new teens i was like you got to stop that thing take those new teen girls off and bring them  right to me he would love it he would appreciate it well he's hanging in our neighborhood now so he's right  across the street from our station is his new office i was watching the news up here in boston  today and they were showing his new office space at carnegie hall yeah that's where our our studio is 
[00:20:00]  right across right across the uh the street from where he's going to be hanging we'll get him on  our show we're going to get him on for one of our teen shows back him in for teen week all right you  want to you want the audio from uh the cnn coverage yeah this is from cnn the voyeur bus and our  problems we have with that you know what they say about people who live in glass houses well a group of  scantily clad women living in a glass bus face some legal trouble and it's not for throwing stones  our genie most makes the most of a visit from the lawyer bus remember all the attention lavished 
[00:20:30]  on that rider truck carrying florida ballots well that same day in new york we focused on a bus  carrying cargo that made even dimpled ballots seem flat  what was it about this vehicle that had grown men pounding on the windows  and standing on a hood to gawk all we're doing is making people happy we were the half dozen  half naked women aboard voyeur bus a promotional vehicle for a girly website that claims to champion 
[00:21:00]  free speech on the internet you didn't need speech to read the minds of motorists who pulled up  alongside the buses picture windows i'm feeling very overdressed most of the women describe  themselves as groupies of the opian anthony radio show broadcasting live from the bus let's go back  to ricky's on the team lawyer bus normally the bus travels around the country with two models paid to  live in it live in full view of the outside world i think we kissed about 50 guys through the window last 
[00:21:30]  night but 50 paled compared to the crowds the radio show attracted for half an hour they've been  running running running just get up with that and it wasn't just pedestrians trying to catch a peek  there was the fedex guy looking like he just received a package from heaven  lo and behold who should appear not reindeer but the police we saw more than one officer taking polaroids 
[00:22:00]  either for evidence or for fun we don't know which  i'm having to blast my life until police finally pulled the bus over and arrested everyone  as for police who at times seem to be giving the bus an escort that police officer has been suspended  that's not right because there was more than one there was more than one they shouldn't take it out  i'm just one cop the voyeur bus folks have filed a 20 million dollar lawsuit against the city for 
[00:22:30]  illegal arrest although it's cold out here but i just want you all to take a look at these ladies  because one has to wonder why the mayor would want to arrest these ladies uh for being and and dressing  uh in the manner that they dress stupid they're absolutely stupid i mean of course of course you're  going to get arrested if you take your clothes off this is the kind of story that gives you goosebumps 
[00:23:00]  and leaves you bewitched bothered and bewildered genie mo cnn new york  way to end our inaugural edition of cnn tonight it was their inaugural edition they have to do a trash  story like that and once again a mayor commenting about something we did that's horrible uh of course if  you're naked you're going to get arrested right if i can't see nudity uh neither should anyone else  my prostate hurts that was a complete mess as you can tell uh let's go to the phones and talk to

[00:29:30]  that's why i hundred that's why i missed the the boston listeners our old listeners yeah they were much more  appreciative i think you're right they were much more understanding that's what i'm seeing here on  instant feedback and on the phone calls i mean come on how about this new york anthony and i both have  body glitter on us body glitter and we didn't uh put it on ourselves if you know what i'm saying and  we're coming home with it on we're stinking of whore we're cheating on you bastards down there in new  york this ought to piss the new york listeners off because now i would like to explain the body glitter 
[00:30:00]  concept okay um you know i i feel this is a conspiracy women have gotten this whole thing  together it's called body glitter it's a way of tracking us because there is no way you come home  to your significant other with body glitter on and say you have not had contact with another woman  doesn't work does not work you have obviously you've obviously touched somebody that had body 
[00:30:30]  glitter on how you deal with it how you explain it to your girlfriend or wife it's a whole nother story  but believe me you will come home you will you will go to the room or the bathroom to wash up and that  stuff does not wash off and you will turn a certain way the light will catch it and bling bling the chick  sees it it's all over what's that what what you what do you got on your neck body glitter so how about  that new york we have body glitter all over our bodies we're soaked in body glitter we're hanging 
[00:31:00]  with our old girlfriend and we're coming back smelling like hope like oh that's right like when you leave  the uh when you leave the strip club and you go whoa i smell like whore all right 617-931-1041 is the phone  number we want to talk to a lot of our old listeners right anthony yeah all right let's go to the  phones and see if we can get something going on we are taking calls live because that's what we do  on our new show now so uh gary what's going on yes um hey uh first of all i just want to say welcome 
[00:31:30]  home and uh i really enjoy hearing your bits here on bcn still oh thank you they're still playing some of  the bits uh yeah well you know the al roker at the sushi bar and the uh that one's getting a little  old at this point yeah see new york they have to deal with it too yeah but um the actual reason i  called is uh um i'm sure i'm i'm assuming that you're familiar with uh sega dreamcast yes of course  right uh this game called crazy taxi have you ever played it or seen it ah the one with the uh wow on 
[00:32:00]  the back of all the trucks okay obviously you're familiar with that yeah did you guys have anything  to do with that or well uh obviously the person that did that is a fan of our show and we're still  trying to hunt him down oh really yeah yeah because uh i think you guys know in boston especially  that uh wow very original to our old radio show and then a few years later it turned up on this video  game we get email all the time going dude dude wow made it to sega dreamcast crazy taxi it's hysterical  you drive behind your trucks they all got wow on them yeah it's pretty cool okay i guess uh so you've 
[00:32:30]  heard this all before yeah no problem gary all right well uh uh thanks a lot and uh hey have a great  time today and uh i'll be listening all right cool thanks gary look at that appreciative uh boston  fan uh yeah wow has just become huge in new york city absolutely huge we got like personal uh uh  stickers now yeah actually you can get a bumper sticker a wow bumper sticker if you like i think  bcn has their own version and we got the the original version in new york if you want one of  those it's a collector's item i think uh our version is more gooder yeah we like our version better 
[00:33:00]  like i don't think they really thought we were coming here when they made these up like they  really didn't think the relationship was strong enough between opie and anthony and bcn yeah still  a little shaky and they did this to throw us a bone right you know what i mean but our names aren't on  it it's like oh i i saw that font when i booted up windows 2000 comes with the comes with the program  right this font all right this is what i should do for the old listeners go to wnew.com and uh there's an 
[00:33:30]  address there if you want one of uh the original wow stickers okay yeah it's 888 7th avenue new york  new york 10106 if you got a pen all right all right anthony i also have been informed that uh  this is a little scary but uh i guess we should announce this we're gonna hang after the show today  who's hanging us what did we do wait a minute uh i guess they set up atlas on lansdowne street yeah  and uh you're invited to come down and say hey what's up hang out yeah right after the show i 
[00:34:00]  think or soon after the show cool we might have to go to the hotel and get some uh showers in and some  banging in but uh you know that just goes hand in hand when you go to a hotel and you're with your  girl you just do some of that some of that monkey banging some of that banging why not because you  know why you don't have to clean up right and you don't have to worry and the room's free  the room let's mess it up let's mess it up so after the show i think it's uh atlas uh where's 
[00:34:30]  that jillian's complex and it's going to be on lansdowne street sometime after the show i don't  know around four i guess yeah okay so come on down if you're in the area what the hell hang out grab  a beer uh bad accent on line two what cheryl what's going on hey how's it going all right cheryl  yeah how you doing good i think you have a fine accent we promised the the new york audience that  we put some of the bad boston accents on the radio today because they're listening back in new york  to this mess mine's really bad no it is it's because i moved to method there it is i forgot 
[00:35:00]  about that accent i love it bad it's really bad that's cool so what's going on cheryl not that  i'm just like to hear you guys up back i was kind of hoping you'd say well we're back in boston but i  guess we're screwed again well the funny thing is like the paper is all speculating that this is like our  official return and something's going to happen you know what what we don't know what's we don't  know what's going to happen that would be awesome because i'll tell you the only reason why i listened  to the other station because of you guys oh thank you i can't believe when they got rid of you i was 
[00:35:30]  really sad yeah yeah we were pretty sad when we were let go too rudely that that was we were into  something pretty good and it was taken away from us but then you know what after a while you realize  it's like after you're in a cult or something and then you get out of it and you look back and go  wow you know that sucked well yeah and you know what you know they suck now you know you know the  cool thing is anthony and i uh after we left boston we finally were able to become ourselves and really 
[00:36:00]  take it to the limit and really uh worked for a station that uh really supports us right right  company that supports their uh most of the time they're posting bail money all the time for us  oh awesome and that's and that's no joke i mean we just told the whole teen voyeur bus story where  13 of our guys got arrested oh god that's a howl that's that's the other thing when we were up here  in boston it was just anthony and i on the radio that was it you know we have like a staff of like  10 or 12 people it's pretty cool back to boston i'll come work for you yeah we're going to try to 
[00:36:30]  figure out something that would be that would be so awesome lawyers on retainer yeah well thank you  cheryl oh welcome back for today anyway can you say uh medford medford medford medford all right  bye-bye you know we're gonna have to have like dueling accents later on in the show we'll have  like uh we'll put a new york guy on and a boston guy and they'll just go at it brooklyn brooklyn in  the house we need brooklyn and a guy from boston yeah so don't forget we'll be at atlas on landsdown 
[00:37:00]  street after the show today i think we're going until three o'clock yep going three o'clock  unless they yank us before that i don't think stay tuned for our big finish though oh we we  wanted to tell everyone about the uh the flashing on the today show yes yes matt lauer katie couric a  little uh a little thrown a little flustered we should start from the beginning it's a quick  story don't worry and then we'll get in we'll get into some more music i think we're going to play uh  some radio radio head excuse me in a little bit here uh yeah after we left boston we continued whip 
[00:37:30]  them out wednesday in new york it's it's huge to this day uh also we we threw another twist into  the whole whip them out wednesday campaign when we went to new york and basically it's uh an assault  on the media yeah it may sound uh familiar to some people up here but uh trust me it's something we  started about three years ago and yeah we could we and other people seem to uh feel that it's such a  great idea that they would just flat out take it if anyone ever feels the need to verify anything  you'd go to a place like foundrymusic.com right and uh see stuff from from years ago right when we would 
[00:38:00]  ask the uh the listeners to go in front of the news cameras any live shots because they happen all  the time out in uh in manhattan uh and just get o and a something to do with the show just something  on that live shot for a valuable prize or a wow sign yeah we've been doing this for like uh ever since  we left yeah anyway uh so so a day didn't go by without a news crew uh getting like a wow sign in the 
[00:38:30]  picture or some idiot like sometimes checking the actual reporter and screaming opie and anthony while  they're on the scene of a of a murder or something they got ridiculous one one news guy he's uh doing  his live shot outside the david letterman studio yeah a couple of uh our listeners have a wow sign  and it had just snowed the sidewalk very slippery so they they they got to do this fast because the  guys in the control truck for the uh news uh uh the cameraman and the uh the reporter uh guys in 
[00:39:00]  the truck will run out and chase the people away with the wow signs so these two guys start running  towards the reporter to flash the wow before the guys in the truck see and slid on the snow right  into the news guy during the live shot and just checked him and he goes flying an old guy that has been  doing uh reports from this uh tv station for yeah for 20 30 years he went flying and then the guys  come out of the truck and chase our listeners down the street and you see it's like some kind of key 
[00:39:30]  top thing because the camera's still on and now the cameraman turned the camera away from the the uh  news guy that just got checked and and he's watching the guys chasing the guy down the street  so the the the reporter had to go over here over here over here and then the camera guy pointed it back  of the reporter and what a professional he got done with his report so that was just one incident but  we were doing it for a really long time assault on the media yeah with wow signs and girls flashing  and stuff so then we went for the alternate uh the uh the ultimate excuse me uh prize and that was to 
[00:40:00]  get some lady to flash her boobs on the today show because we've all seen the today show and they had  the cameras outside the studio and stuff and they talked to all the rubes from all over the united states  of america so uh we put the challenge out when we first got there right it was our first goal  was to get some some type of recognition we want a girl to go to the today show now you've seen this  show they have all the rubes from all over the country with their signs hi hi billy bob i'm from 
[00:40:30]  kansas you know and they got the signs and everything and the camera pans the crowd before they go to uh  fat al roker to do the weather well we offered a thousand dollars to the first girl that got her  boobs live on the today show and it took a long time took about two years and uh one day there it was  the cameras pan in the audience everyone's waving with their signs this uh very innocent looking girl 
[00:41:00]  standing there camera pans by her she just lifts her shirt up boobs flop out she's got a big wow  big wow sticker sticker sticker on the official wow sticker on her stomach and that was it and katie  kirk was just freaked out she lost her mind she's just looking her jaw dropped uh matt lower started  chuckling and uh we found out later because now ob being employees of nbc television yeah we'll get  into that later the nbc network that's right um we found out that uh matt lower really loved it 
[00:41:30]  and uh they the tapes went all over they passed the tapes around and the girl came up claimed it  and uh we had to go down to the atm and uh opie and i take out 500 dollars each because the station  wasn't fessing up for this out of our own pockets i was like i was freaking here's something that uh  boston should understand too we still don't make any money yeah somehow some way so 500 we're  on tv we we got a number one show in new york somehow we still don't make enough where taking 
[00:42:00]  500 out of the bank isn't devastating but uh yeah she did it we paid her off made a extra uh well the  clip was played on every newscast in america yeah cnn once again and then jay leno was doing spoofs on  it he had matt lower on talking about uh the wowing and talking about this stupid radio promotion in new  york called whip them out wednesday yeah so it got some legs and it got us some sick exposure we 
[00:42:30]  want to play the the matt lower clip from um uh jay leno we didn't we didn't bring it up here to  boston so we're going to try to find it in new york that way so stick around for that okay all right  uh a guy wants to talk to us on the line here and then we'll go back to uh back to music let's  see hello kevin yeah what's going on chilling man uh where are you from south headley all right right on  what do you got i was in the stands the day with wheelchair fred been waiting two and a half years

[00:54:00]  your uh music opie your segs you like my um music collection oh yeah thank you thank you please  uh one of the guys from our show psycho mark got fired yeah got fired and it's an interesting story  uh it has something to do with boston too yeah you might have even heard us on nick carter's show when  we were broadcasting from uh the sam adams brewery that was what in the summertime i think july or so late  july uh well we we came up to the sam adams brewery uh thank you jim cook who's a very good 
[00:54:30]  friend of the our radio show in new york he was when we were up here too and uh he came down to new  york a bunch of times and did our show we were able to bring the whole show up uh to the uh brewery  unfortunately boston wasn't able to hear it but we went on nick's show to say hey and all that yeah  and the way we were giving away the trips to join us for this fine trip to boston to the brewery  was a simple little contest called sex for sam sex for sam it's easy what we did was we got  together this point system uh various point values for for having sex at different locations around 
[00:55:00]  the city right public locations around the city right so we got some uh couples together and uh  basically we set them loose uh in new york city in manhattan with an escort to verify that they  were having sexual activity like uh yeah the escort had to make sure there was going on okay they had  to really have real sex in public all over the city it didn't matter how long it was there just had 
[00:55:30]  to be the act of sex happen for even if it was just a second right so quickie so they had a list of  things like sex in front of a homeless guy five points uh sex on one of those double-decker tour buses  uh ten points sex in front of uh the hot dog vendor uh yes five points right uh sex in a hotel lobby  sex in uh the middle of times square big point value is sex in tiffany's which is such an insane  exclusive jewelry store in new york city i don't think i have to explain that we all know that 
[00:56:00]  and yeah couples were having sex in the middle of tiffany's around people and most people had no clue  in central park central park um oh didn't we have a 30 rock 30 rock fellow center i mbc uh yeah  yeah yeah yeah i forgot about that's the three times we screwed over nbc yeah we'll talk about  that later too uh also uh sex in a cab yeah uh sex in uh themed uh restaurants it goes on hard  rod so they had a whole list and they were calling the show all day going uh you know like ben who's  helping us at the radio show up here who's from boston by the way and actually spent many time here 
[00:56:30]  at bcn he works on our show um ben was one of the guys that was an escort and and you know he would  call and go okay my couple's having sex in a cab and we're like okay that couple gets five points  make a long story short uh the couples that had the most point total what was invited to to join us  on our boston uh trip to the the brewery now ope you're forgetting about one important feature  no i was leaving that for you that the bonus point the two-point conversion two-point conversion  on this uh sex for sam uh contest was if you got backdoor action in public now we were just looking 
[00:57:00]  for uh sex regular sex but if the couple did backdoor action in any of these locations you got an extra  two points that's right and the two points did come in to into play many many times have the one  couple they only did it that way okay yeah what a mess so one of the things on the list for the 
[00:57:30]  sex for sam uh contest was um sex in the boss's office yeah yeah once again proving that opie and  anthony never learned it's our uh general manager ken stevens who runs a lot of radio stations for the  company we now work for he's our big boss right and uh he has this really really nice corner office  class so you can see everything that's going on in his office at any given time nice furniture in  there too leather furniture nice leather couch he overlooks uh the streets of manhattan gorgeous 
[00:58:00]  skyline view this was horrid so he threw it on the list like it would be uh a biggie like 25 points if  you have sex in the boss's office yeah so psycho mark his name fits perfectly his couple they were  absolutely insane yeah and they were the ones that were doing the backdoor action everywhere  right and uh the competition got so heated that uh psycho mark was thinking the only way i'm going  to be able to put this over the top and have my couple win is to have my couple have sex in the 
[00:58:30]  general manager's office with the two-point conversion he decided to go for the two-point  conversion or have his couple go for the two-point conversion in the boss's office in the boss's office  on the leather couch where a lot of big deals have gone down for the radio station so now what uh  psycho mark does is he calls us up and says all right i'm making my way back to the station we got  one more stop the boss's office because i really want this couple to get those points and we know 
[00:59:00]  they've been the ones with the back door for the whole time so we're like oh my god he's going to bring  them into the boss's office to do this well now our uh our pd jeremy goes running to uh the boss's  office as psycho mark is coming up at the couple and goes uh what are you doing i'm getting points  for my team by the way uh psycho mark from boston as well yeah blows blows past them yeah uh the couple  lays on the couch in our gm's office and proceeds to engage in backdoor action that's right on 
[00:59:30]  the uh boss's couch while uh people were going about their daily business at the radio station  yeah yeah and you got to understand where this office is it's a very busy section of uh the  radio station it has nothing to do with the broadcast facility and it's on the other side  of the building and we've all seen the sexual harassment tapes i think this would qualify yeah  this would be a serious problem if they said this at your at your job this is right over the top  right so uh jeremy our uh program director is looking in the window at psycho mark shaking his head 
[01:00:00]  with this look of horror on his face basically saying do not do it your job is in jeopardy if  you don't listen to me psycho marks on the phone with us live on the air going this is great my  couple's having a backdoor action on the boss's couch unbelievable and then he goes oh what what  okay guys i think i'm in big trouble i got jeremy is so pissed off at me oh my god  and then uh hang up um and then he was gone he got fired immediately and uh it was called gross 
[01:00:30]  insubordination and right gross it was so he got fired for having can you say a s on the radio up  here uh we do it down there so just anal all right yeah i got fired for having a couple have anal on  the boss's couch on the boss's couch right there you go an ode to psycho mark another lovely story  all right we got lots to do uh anthony obviously it's opie and anthony we're back in boston and 
[01:01:00]  and honestly we really want to thank uh wbcn for having us back yeah uh they you know a lot of stuff  has been said and uh and written but the the truth needs to be told bcn uh ever since we got fired  was nothing but cool to us yeah nothing but cool to us open their arms to us and it didn't take long  we had some problems but we definitely worked it out it wasn't uh it wasn't like uh let's just forget  about the past it was it was you know a lot of people a lot of healing had a had to happen and  it did but you know something a lot of people thought it was going to be a lot harder than it 
[01:01:30]  was right because uh when when you're when you're firing shots at each other no matter who it is or  what it is and you really can't see the person and it's far away and you're separated like uh we were on  different radio stations it's uh it's easy to to sling uh uh crap around yeah you know but then when you  hook up you're hanging out having a few beers you realize you know hey this ain't so hard you  know we just hook up get together have some fun and that's what it's been like with the people at bcn 
[01:02:00]  and uh they've been really cool like upset right from the start and uh and it also needs to be said  we don't want to rehash the the past too much but this needs to be said to uh uh anthony and i to this  day have not talked to management of the other stations since we've been fired no they refused they  just turned their backs on us and you need to know that they refuse to talk to us and uh i'll just  throw this little tidbit out there anthony and i our contract's up in three months anyone can hire  us yeah we have not gotten a call no you need to know that okay yeah even if we got the call at this 
[01:02:30]  point trust me we're not going back but just a little just a little information for you okay a lot  of people are saying uh over there oh no they we offered they didn't want to come back  no that way it wasn't even there wasn't any offer out there it uh it never happened we we had a lot  of problems with them after uh we got the boot you know nobody was we didn't get a call from any of  the uh management anything you know would have been nice right you know who called bcn that's right 
[01:03:00]  that's the bottom line all right well enough of that though because that's been rehashed a lot but we  just want to say something about that today okay anthony uh yeah we're going to be here until three  and then we're going to atlas on lansdowne street to have some beers with our old listeners if you  feel like hanging out with us great if not we understand we would love to shake some uh hands  and see some old faces right don't get any body glitter on you no no all over johnny but it's atlas  on lansdowne street in the julian's uh complex complex compound whatever help me out ben you

[01:06:30]  eight years now oh yeah and i'm from the bronx i can tell you all about the differences between the  girls too all right uh which girls are hotter boston girls or new york girls well let's put  it this way if you want to get laid with some stupid hooker go to new york if you want to have  somebody that looks really good on your arm you stay in boston but if you want a girlfriend you  really have to go for a midwestern girl that you can find here or in boston or in new york something 
[01:07:00]  like that that's that's a breakdown right there now look at that pros and cons of both sides  open all right thank you alex all right cheap slot new york let's go let's go to jimmy he's from  salvi hey what's up hey what's up jimmy uh yankees suck you gotta stop talking about new york all right  you know i wasn't even gonna bring this up uh but you brought it up yankees suck yes and who do you uh  who do you like what time do you like well i think i like the red sox okay all right do i even have to 
[01:07:30]  say anything i don't know jimmy i agree with you i hate the yankees too well now that's true opie  a huge met fans you're gonna read it stop shut up come on everyone knows i'm a red sox fan that's sad  we were up here for three years i was rooting on the socks now let me tell you something everybody  knows even before we were uh up here uh for the first time oh look listening to the delay that's  all right go ahead even before we were up here we were originally from new york  so we had our uh allegiance to uh teams mine has always been the new york yankees 
[01:08:00]  and uh every time you go out the boston fans always start the yankees suck yankees suck chant  and i just don't understand it i don't get the chant how do you say yankees suck when they always end  up in the world series and usually win it well because they bought the team who cares i know bottom  line i can't be in on this argument because i'd lose every time well i wasn't even going to bring  it up the subway series was absolutely insane down in new york the gunfire the uh the strangulations 
[01:08:30]  the knifings you think uh the socks and the yanks have a rivalry when you get met fans and yankee fans  together it was out of control and uh speaking of the yankee met um uh uh rivalry remember the time we  we called the white house yeah another uh thing that almost got us fired if this was a sitcom right  now everything would go fuzzy and it would go to the yeah segment could we do remember when that 
[01:09:00]  happened bling bling bling bling yeah we uh we uh hillary clinton is um of course one of the the fine  senators now from new york state and when she was running she would try to come off like uh like she was a  real new yorker and um she had no allegiance to any sports team she knew nothing about new york she's  she's quite a tool and um we figured hey if she's such a big fan of new york and a big fan of the 
[01:09:30]  yankees we were going to uh give her some tickets give her some seats to watch the game at yankee stadium  so we called up the white house looking for hillary clinton offer her the tickets  and uh the trouble was brewing when um the secret service once again get involved  you can't you can't try to get in touch with these people without the secret service really getting  on your case and uh there were all these wacky rules about permission to be on the air and things 
[01:10:00]  like that that kind of got thrown in it led to another meeting that almost got us thrown out and  the company we we are working for they were in the middle of uh uh a tiny little thing called a  billion dollar merger well multi-billion dollar merger viacom cbs merger once again showing you guys  uh yeah we haven't learned a thing since leaving boston it never ends another thing is uh the whole 
[01:10:30]  connection now with nbc i gotta tell you something the uh the station we went to after we got fired from  boston wnew uh was just the biggest crap hole uh wasteland of a radio station nothing going on there  they were playing classic rock and uh we got there and all we would hear from the three listeners that  were left listening to the station was shut up and play some credence you know like three old hippies 
[01:11:00]  still listening to the station and we had just come from you know an active rock station we were out and  about up here uh having a great time with listeners interviewing all the latest fans we felt like  we were hip and and happening and then we hear uh from our our boss hey um guys five o'clock today  john cougar mellencamp coming in we're like oh my god shoot me opie shoot me and we're sitting in our  studio in new york going and everyone back in boston is convinced that we got fired on purpose to make  our careers better if they only knew the big rumor that we all we did it on purpose we got fired so we 
[01:11:30]  could go back to new york we're like if they only knew the jock on before us had one long and was  72 years old 72 no joke yeah he's a legend his name's scott muney i mean he's a he's a when it  comes to radio and music he's a legend he was there on the runway when the beatles landed he was there  yeah that's his voice that's uh scott muney listen to the you could just hear like the the phlegm in 
[01:12:00]  his in his uh lungs that's him smacking his lip after a break right he would get like his teeth are  falling out and he would he would do these breaks and you could hear him uh struggling for air because  he was down to one lung at this point now another beatles block on wnew that's exactly how he sounded  and this is what we had to deal with this is what we got fired on purpose for so when we got to the 
[01:12:30]  station uh it was just the biggest crap hole so we really had to make some noise to be even noticed  in uh new york city so we would do things that would get us in trouble right because that's the  best way to get no of course and that's when we uh invented this whole assault on the media thing  right because uh the company wasn't spending dime one on any w we were convinced that it was some form  of tax write-off that had to fail in order for them to make money so they threw us on there as a 
[01:13:00]  punishment for what we did up here we were convinced that it was a punishment by cbs and infinity broadcasting  for what we did uh when we were up here so we we were like let's assault the media with signs and  whatnot signs and saying oh you know opie and anthony show wow signs uh trying to get girls to flash like  we mentioned earlier and any any sign uh related to the show yeah i know it sounds really familiar to 
[01:13:30]  some of you guys out there but well we did this like two years ago whatever but go ahead anthony we had  we had held back what we called the a-bomb this is the atomic bomb of signs that will go on live  television right and whenever uh we felt like we needed a little more press a little publicity a  little boost to get people to know who we are and uh get on the news and get in the papers there was  always the a-bomb to drop uh one day it finally happened it was channel four news in new york which is 
[01:14:00]  nbc nbc nbc new york uh network news woman doing a live broadcast from times square about the double  decker tour buses tour buses yeah um they go to her live she's doing her little break and all right well  okay i just want to make people understand that at this point you know the media was getting attacked 
[01:14:30]  from all angles with wow signs opie and anthony signs to the point where um the reporters when they  were doing their live shots had to do it from on top of the uh the van the station van because they  wanted to get away from the the psycho listeners from our show at ground level it was known that they  would now hire security people to keep the people with signs away from their live broadcast what is this  way we have video of people getting tackled live on tv with their wow signs and their opian anthony  signs i mean absolutely insane it's pretty funny all right so uh yeah this uh this poor reporter 
[01:15:00]  melissa russo you know melissa russo and melissa if you're listening in new york because the show is  going back to new york what it wasn't about you you just happened to be in the wrong place at the  wrong time innocent bystanders sometimes get caught in the crossfire so she's on top of her little  news van doing her uh report because she wasn't stupid enough to be on the sidewalk next to our  listeners well the listener is down in new york very smart yeah they boosted someone on their  shoulders and they had a sign the a-bomb that is now all over the internet yeah all over the place 
[01:15:30]  the sign was the c-word the c-word the c-word the big c-word the c-word you know see you next tuesday  correct what they sometimes call it and big letters that appeared right behind her head while she was  trying to do her news report derogatory term for female anatomy i think we all know what the c-word  is anthony oh do you remember trying to describe it back in new york i would expect the boston listeners  a little more educated than our new york listeners so maybe they could pick up on it easier but i 
[01:16:00]  remember having to explain 800 effing times what the c-word was what cake what did you why hold the  sign that said cake jack off so we we uh got the a-bomb it was in the newspapers on the on the news  they cubed it out on the news but there it was the c-word the a-bomb and now uh after things like um  showing live boobs on the today show which is nbc nbc the c-word on nbc nbc because we would tell 
[01:16:30]  our listeners you steer clear of cbs because cbs owns uh infinity and we're not stupid no you know  something we had to be told not to do cbs because we had done it like three times so we figured we  pick on nbc uh opie and i now employed by nbc television that's right making our national debut  tonight unfortunately it's not gonna be on in boston yeah how about that but we signed on to do a little 
[01:17:00]  thing called the xfl game day show yes we're the pre-game show for the xfl it's uh where is it it's  in la chicago it airs new york city yeah uh unfortunately yeah not in boston other markets  to be added we're hearing but it's a real big deal it's on tonight at uh 7 30 anthony vince mcmahon of  the wwf let me tell you something i want these two ass wipes on my show a tag team match  anal on the couch i like these guys so vince picked us up and uh we are now involved with 
[01:17:30]  the uh the fine folks of uh nbc sports yeah yeah getting bad press in uh many markets now instead  of one well you know how it is with the xfl a lot of traditional football fans and sports casters  they want to see this go away as quickly as possible they cannot believe uh anyone would want to watch  uh football unless it was the nfl and uh personally i i think it's going to be a lot of fun 
[01:18:00]  regardless if we work there or not because tell you the truth before we even got the job  uh with the xfl game day uh we were pushing it like it was fun because it sounds fun i love the  no fair catch rule yeah people just gonna get creamed that's all i want to see yeah you want  to race you want to see cars crash you watch a football game you want to see people butt heads  and really get effed up uh anthony this just in too tonight uh bcn's xfl kickoff party join cali at  jillian's to watch the inaugural game starting at 7 30. 7 30. and we're going to be at jillian's uh

[01:35:00]  give me his seed much like the mighty iceberg that was that split open the hole of the mighty titanic  he split open my egg with his seed  the cold dank internal organs that are my reproductive system  finally took his man's seed and gave us a lovely baby 
[01:35:30]  how he was able to get it past my huge camel toe well like camel lips that's what they look like  and it was so hard to get pregnant everybody  then when the doctor told me i would be having a little baby  me and renee cried because after his bout with cancer it was so hard for him to have sperm that worked 
[01:36:00]  after the chemo they swam around in circles stupid retarded sperm did not know where to go  and my reproductive system my womb nothing had been there in years it was disgusting and dank like an old cave  and the camel toe did not allow anything past it would swat it like flies on a hamburger  in the summer time at the cookout the sperm would try to get in and the camel would 
[01:36:30]  smack it dead like an insect  then the doctor found out i had one of those fluorescent lights that killed the sperm with  electrical charges in me and removed it when his sperm slammed into my egg like the mighty titanic  it slammed into the iceberg we learned the baby would be one of the few survivors  a survivor i dedicate my baby 
[01:37:00]  to the survivors of that fateful night  and those that died in the icy waters of my womb  thank you tim guys you rock for uh getting us that believe you had the theme yeah we didn't bring  the titanic music with us today just you know hopefully no one in new york knows i have it  okay keep it on the qt all right right guys we'll see you monday all right cool take care she should  wear rappers clothes or something because that those tight pants she has the worst camel toe i've ever

[01:43:00]  oh we better get on the dumb button really quick they might say something we curse on the air out  there just to freak each other out right down in new york just to see if they're on their toes  see if they're on their toes they'll just blurt out the c word that's something we got to tell  people really fast when we were up here in boston we didn't work uh with what's called a delay yeah  i mean we just uh flew by the seat of our pants taking live calls it was it was kind of scary uh 
[01:43:30]  they don't trust us in new york no we're on like a 48 second delay 48 seconds there are times that  we'll finish a break on the radio and we'll listen to the last 48 seconds as we're like taking a leak yeah  yeah they don't trust us so they have a 48 second delay they have five different people that uh  can dump out of the show at any given time on on buttons and now up here they were freaking out  as a matter of fact i believe they wanted us to uh tape calls and uh edit them during the show 
[01:44:00]  and we're like you know dust off that ancient delay system because uh we don't even know how to work  that way anymore they had their own special delay system up here the guy standing right behind you with  the gun we want to make sure we uh behave all right let's get into santa kane oh you can get  into us and no that's what you want well santa kane is a stripper yeah and a comedian yeah we use the  word comedian very loosely in this case and stripper uh stripper that loosely very loosely uh she's like 
[01:44:30]  70 something years old yeah she's about 74 75 she uh says she's a stripper that does comedy we've never  seen the comedy and uh this as for the stripping part who wants to see that right it's a mess so  she comes in she lights her uh her boobies on fire and stuff for us she does a lot of crazy things and  one day she looks like yucca flats after the blast so one day she's in the studio and she decided to 
[01:45:00]  tell us that she has a hemorrhoid yeah and it's an ugly hemorrhoid well she would also come in and  she'd talk and just babble like you couldn't understand what she was saying she'd go from one subject to  another and occasionally she'd make this sound and so she'd be gone yeah i got i got a show coming up  i'm gonna be there and i strip and i do comedy and i have my friend this uh adult toy and he dances  look he dances and she just had to know her and she'd make that sound and it would freak you out 
[01:45:30]  because she's so rude and so disgusting to look at as a stripper she's not funny as a comedian  and we don't know what she does but she was so freaky we had to invite her back so she says hey  guys i got a hemorrhoid do you want to see it and being the sick f i am i'm like yeah cool let's check  it out come here she's 72 years old gets about what two feet away from me bends over and i i checked  out her hemorrhoid checked out the hemorrhoid horrific because she kept complaining about she goes  i'm itching oh that's hurt and she's scratching she's digging and and we were like what is your  problem she goes i got a hemorrhoid i got hemorrhoid and i got i gotta get rid of it 
[01:46:00]  i gotta get rid of it right did you see that it's a new toy and and then you go on a tear and opie  goes no let me see your hemorrhoid so she comes by him and showed and i'm freaked out i'm not looking  i'm on the other side of the console i can't look at this so um next time she came back because she has  these all the time from what i understand we had a listener come in to apply preparation aids to her 
[01:46:30]  hemorrhoids try to help the girl out a little bit help the old gal out another example how we torture  our new york audience who the hell wants to hear this right yeah so he um he got there he put on this  it wasn't even a surgical glove i don't think he trusted it he used those big yellow playtex living  gloves he used to to wash dishes with either that or some kind of a electric company glove  that used to throw that big switch like he really didn't just want to use a surgical glove so he puts 
[01:47:00]  that on he uh grabs some preparation age and who are you kidding he looked like uh uh dustin hoffman  in that movie a breakout or outbreak whatever outbreak suit put him in an outbreak suit and he puts  it on his uh gloved finger on his index finger i guess and uh sandy kane comes over you know and  she's having a great great time and uh exposes the uh roid and he applied the cream very lightly 
[01:47:30]  very lightly as she was talking so what you're going to hear is her saying this is actual tape  of this old woman having preparation age applied to her hemorrhoid she didn't know exactly when it was  coming so i believe she was going to say something like i don't believe i'm doing this  it gets interrupted by someone applying and you can tell the sound she makes  it can only be made when someone pokes you there now listen here is 
[01:48:00]  and and and sandy kane i don't believe i don't believe i'm doing this and you can tell it's like  here it is again i don't believe  that's classic yeah now it didn't end there we we decided to see how far we can take how far we can  push it so and the listener now feeling a little more comfortable having a little more bravado  uh uh lubes up again for a second sortie into that forbidden zone 
[01:48:30]  and and and i don't believe  so uh she comes back over and now we're kind of making signals to him like like come on you know  give it to her go sink it right like sink it  so here it is the second uh attempt can i hear the first one first so we can compare 
[01:49:00]  here it is okay here's the second time that the the guy applied the preparation age here it is it's  quick it's short it's sweet but it again is a sound that's only made when someone applies preparation  edge to that area and we we told him we were making hand signals like go go like okay and here's the  sound she made oh oh that is application two so one i don't buy it two oh 
[01:49:30]  all right we didn't stop there no no this is going too well so we tell the guy all right lube up  two digits he puts the preparation age on his uh pointer and middle and this is all behind santa  kane's back she has no idea what came is because she's so lost so out there and lost she doesn't  even know what's going on in between this so we're telling him all right two wicko go 
[01:50:00]  for two and and and we're like now this might be really aware drive it home so he applies it to  his fingers she stands there she really wasn't expecting this one again another short thank you  sweet one uh let me run you through it first one i don't play it second one oh and now the third and 
[01:50:30]  final application where he just he slammed it home again only a sound made when someone is really  applying some preparation air i knew that i would  down down down down down down when i hold you in my 
[01:51:00]  so now put all together first application i don't play it second oh third  the story of sandy kane sandy kane uh anthony yeah good news uh everyone in new york already knows  this uh they're listening today as well but uh the old listeners here in boston you could see video 
[01:51:30]  clips oh yeah of this exact thing you think it's funny to hear when you watch her jump uh when you  see this you could watch the video it's on uh foundry music dot com know who loves uh these video  clips jim brewer who's coming in in a little while brewer almost wet himself uh foundry music dot com  f-o-u-n-d-r-y music dot com yeah there's a whole opie and anthony archive on there and just stuff that  we've done since we were in new york and uh it's a very very uh concise and the site's full it's full

[01:57:00]  40 bucks don't tell my mother man oh my god what's it do that's the thing dude i don't even know  all i know is that it's serious crap it's like a buick with a fuse in it look it's got wings you gotta put  it together you gotta put it together that's all i need to say you gotta put it together  my brother came home from the army and uh he had his army buddies uh visit him about a year or so 
[01:57:30]  later yeah and they brought some goodies with him one was an m uh one a tank simulator this thing  simulated the blast of a tank shell hitting the ground what without the shrapnel and whatnot this is  unbelievable so it was a green canister with some military writing on it that unscrewed and had a  couple of uh contacts inside so i'm like oh let me go to the hardware store grab some wire and a dry  cell battery we'll go out to the john glenn field out there and uh and we'll set this booger off you 
[01:58:00]  know so i put it in the field i had like 50 feet of wire and you never realize how short 50 feet is  until you until it's the only distance between you and something that explodes  so so i unroll it and i'm looking i go okay well it's a little closer than i would like to be  but there's no shrapnel you know so i'll attach one one wire to the positive side of the dry cell  i'll hook the other wire and then throw it on the contact and run away so by the time 
[01:58:30]  the igniter heats up or something for that long haul the electricity's got to make down 50 feet oh that  could take nanoseconds gives me more than enough time to run to spin away right yeah i i no sooner  did that wire brush the contact than i just saw a white light and and got blown back where the ground  wasn't even under my feet anymore like you can't see it because it's radio i'm sorry but for you guys 
[01:59:00]  i was like this in midair like my arms are straight out my legs straight out and i'm flying backwards i  land on my ass and now the flash was so bright i heard my pupils slam shut they were like and i  couldn't see so i'm feeling myself feeling okay fingers good fingers there i'm feeling everything  i swear to you not a mark on me but the concussion from this thing because there was no shrapnel  everything was right there contained no metal hitting me but the blast the friggin shockwave 
[01:59:30]  it reminded me of those scenes you see on discovery of the house from the a-bomb getting blown one way  and the trees snapping i swear i got blown like 10 feet right on my ass i felt like the coyote it really  did man i knew how it felt and and then afterwards when you realize you're okay it's like dude was that  the coolest i thought i was dead but now that i'm not how cool is that right that's funny 
[02:00:00]  really really sick all right why didn't make it illegal yeah right there used to be so much fun  john yeah what's up make my own pipe bomb  who on long island didn't have a buddy that made his own pipe bomb  i got a bunch of m80s we'll just hollow out the side with a screwdriver dump them in the pipe  get all the duds and the next day yeah yeah we'll make a genie step on it it explodes you get the  lit genie and step on it and mid-spotulate it turned pink

[02:22:30]  it the most intimate of areas in various fashion we will ask for up and down side to side and circular  based on the sounds you hear on that phone you have to decide if her style is the traditional triangle  the mohawk which is just shaved in on the sides the hitler mustache which is shaved in on the sides and  then shaved down on the top so it's just that little nub of hair yeah much like under adolph's 
[02:23:00]  nose or what we call the wood floor or john bonnet ramsay which is just completely shaved not a hair to  be found those will be your four choices the game very deceiving now jenny yes your job in this whole  thing is to uh do as we instruct with the phone right and then when you're done do not give us any  inkling of what style hair you have as everyone guesses don't give us any clues like no or huh 
[02:23:30]  or any indication that whoever's guessing is right or wrong okay until we ask you what is in your pants  right you got it should we ask uh jenny if she's hot or not we usually don't like doing this because  it ruins the fantasy i'm 300 pounds right and it doesn't matter where i rub it on my body you're  gonna hear hair you know we don't need that all right we're gonna assume that jenny's very hot  yeah i'll probably see you guys in a little bit oh you're going down you're going atlas atlas hopefully  atlas lands down the street right after the show we're all going all right um do you where are you
