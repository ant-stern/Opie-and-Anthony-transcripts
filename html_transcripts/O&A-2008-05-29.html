<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a graphic description of Opie's debilitating illness, involving a severe headache, vomiting, and intense gastrointestinal distress.  His girlfriend's amused reaction to his suffering was recounted in detail, prompting discussion about Opie's frequent illnesses and the potential for creating a show franchise to account for his absences.  The conversation then turned to Opie's acupuncture treatment, with Long Island Steve calling in to contribute to the humorous discussion of acupuncture points, including the placement of needles in sensitive areas.  Coach Mike was present in the studio during this segment.  A caller corrected a misconception about Chinese earthquake relief policies.

The show then shifted to a lengthy critique of the "Sex and the City" movie, focusing on its marketing, target audience, and the reported disappointment of fans at the premiere.  The hosts generated numerous humorous and morbid alternative plotlines for the film, involving gruesome deaths, astronauts, police indictments, and ukulele factories in Iraq.  A listener shared a story about a fight in a spin class.  Further (possibly fabricated) plot details of the "Sex and the City" movie were discussed, leading to much confusion and amusement.  The hosts announced that Bill Burr, Otto, and possibly George were scheduled to appear later.

Comedian Bill Burr joined the show in studio.  The conversation began with a discussion of a movie screening and a poorly proofread script.  It then moved to a humorous critique of *Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull*, including suggestions for a geriatric sequel and listener emails further criticizing the film, particularly a scene with Cynthia Nixon.  Burr discussed his upcoming stand-up performances at Caroline's and his appearance on Jim Norton's HBO special. He shared anecdotes about fellow comedian Sean Rouse.

A significant portion of this segment centered on Anthony's new relationship with Jill Nicolini, with much playful teasing from the hosts and Bill Burr, featuring the song "Amazed" by Lone Star.  Details about their dates and meetings with family were discussed, along with commentary on Anthony's attire and Jill's perceived change in clothing style.  Other topics included Anthony's clothing with hidden gun pockets, Bill Burr's experiences with first-class airline service, the firing of an ESPN radio host for offensive comments about Ted Kennedy, and audio clips from Nick Hogan's jail calls expressing distress.  Jill Nicolini called in towards the end, adding to the playful banter and confirming the relationship while downplaying the significance of "Amazed."  The segment concluded with promotion of Burr's and Auto's upcoming performances.

Auto, another guest, joined Bill Burr in studio.  A discussion about Nick Hogan's eight-month jail sentence and plans for a "real ality" show ensued, along with disgusted reactions to Nick's lack of remorse regarding his friend's coma. Clips of Nick's interview and his mother's comments were played.  Much of the conversation focused on Auto and his puppet act with George, including his career, appearances with Stone Temple Pilots, clips from the movie "Magic," and a reference to a *Tales from the Crypt* episode. Auto vehemently denied any emotional attachment to his puppet.

The show then covered a Denver man attempting to create a city commission to prepare for alien contact, followed by speculation on the origins of rapid advancements in space technology. A lengthy discussion of *Rocky IV*, focusing on its final speech and awkward production, ensued.  Finally, the hosts discussed the death of a 61-year-old woman who had lived for decades in an iron lung, reacting with dark humor to the circumstances. A call from the voice actor of the "Anthelini Update" was included.

The final segment heavily featured Ultimate Warrior's online ramblings, dissecting his bizarre and sexually suggestive statements.  Hulk Hogan and his son Nick were also mentioned.  A significant portion was devoted to a comedic and highly critical discussion of *The Flintstones*, contrasting it with Warner Brothers cartoons.  A news story about a special needs child voted out of kindergarten led to a darkly humorous and highly offensive discussion.  A recurring bit featuring "Jive Talking Jimmy" was included, along with mentions of the rising cost of Spam and a discussion about Asperger's syndrome, often peppered with offensive jokes and language. No explicitly named guests were present in the studio for this segment.

[00:02:30]  worse as uh the day went on eight o'clock i'm like i'm just going to bed i don't feel right i popped  a couple aspirin next thing you know i'm just probably one of the worst headaches ever to the  point where i can't lay in bed anymore i'm now pacing my apartment from end to end with my eyes  closed because even just having my eyes open and any little bit of light was driving me nuts so i turned  off all the lights in my apartment but lights were you know the light was coming in from the outside 
[00:03:00]  and even that was bothering me so i'm like just walking and pacing with my eyes closed next thing you  know i'm in the bathroom and i'm sitting down let's just just let's just put it that way i'm sitting  down where in the bathroom yeah but where in the on the turlet yeah on the turlet the chairlet i think  my grandma used to call it the turlet why don't you go if you got a tummy ache why don't you go sit  on the chairlet a while right on the just sit on the chairlet and there were noise like this because 
[00:03:30]  now i'm thinking headache means toxins means there's too much you know what in me and because  of this dumb dumb hours that we keep it that's what my problem is weekends no problem  my my brother flowing but my doctor my uh my acupuncturist says it's uh it's stress and and  i'm holding everything inside because i'm because i'm tense and i need to just let everything go 
[00:04:00]  meaning the stress and then everything else will follow oh i call him a quack-upunturist  because you know like a quack and acupuncture exactly the whole doctor thing stop it  funny word so this has happened before with the headaches and i'm thinking the toxins and i'm in  in the bathroom on the turlet so next thing you know all you all you hear in the other room because  my girl's trying to sleep is  you're dead lifting in there 
[00:04:30]  that's a great way to put it it can sound like you're dead lifting right you know it's bad when  you're the bedroom on the turlet making noises that sound like you're you're trying to set some  power lifting record are you okay are you are you doing the clean and jerk what are you what are  you doing well  so just over and over  oh by the way before that as i'm trying to you know sleep with the headache 
[00:05:00]  um let's just put it this way uh all of a sudden i hear my girl giggling  because there's a bathroom off the master bedroom and she's got some spray and she's giggling and  spraying oh no so that was the first sign that was the first sign that i'm in a bad place but i'm so  i got such a headache that i'm like ah i'll just deal i can't you know i can't i can't hold anything in  whatever wants to come out has to come out because i feel awful because it's bad stuff 
[00:05:30]  yeah because i understand that my my girl's beautiful and i'm marrying her and i probably  shouldn't be doing that anymore no so i for the most part i don't but when you're sick and you got  the tummy and the headache you got to let it all out right so i'm on the turlet  and i'm finally you know doing my thing but that's not taking care of my headache so then i lay  back down and i got up and lay back down and got up it was just a nightmare and then uh all of a sudden 
[00:06:00]  i go to my girl and i say uh i uh i'm gonna go make myself puke this is ridiculous but as soon as  i got up i had like just i turned white had the sweats oh no nauseous ready to puke i'm like oh wow  i don't even have to put fingers down my throat ran into the bathroom and it was just a disaster  disaster a disaster my friend and then finally that's uh at that point at 11 15 i had to type  the boys and say look i'm not making it man you guys do whatever you have to do but i can't make 
[00:06:30]  it in man i did what i had to do shut off all alarms that's what i did shut those alarms off  lest i be annoyed in the morning when steve i got a message from steve and i'm like well me and  ant should do the show of opus sick because you shouldn't feel like you shouldn't like worry like  i can't be sick for a day or the whole and i was like i gotta call anthony but not now

[00:10:00]  yesterday i went for my back and it works does it a lot of people don't think this stuff works but  the chinese have been doing this for what 10 000 years or something they've also been you know  shipping over uh lead toys to us huh what does that mean yeah just because the chinese oh chinese  have been doing it for thousands of years yeah you ever see the place they got one earthquake and and  uh they got a casualty count like a world war ii i mean 
[00:10:30]  a little shake shake shake and yeah their whole society is destroyed over here figure it out build  your buildings on springs you know they lost so many people in this earthquake that they uh  they lifted the ban of having one kid one child wow really in those areas oh we've all heard right  there's so many people in china that you're only allowed to have one kid uh but in these places  that were just devastated they've lifted the ban and these uh and these parents could have more than  one kid that i don't know why they would do that i mean they really have to thin the herd to begin 
[00:11:00]  with yeah let nature thin the herd gives everybody uh a little elbow room obviously it was a disaster  and blah blah blah i don't want to get in trouble for saying that but yeah you never know these days  no kidding so i went to the acupuncturist and uh this fine chinese doctor popped about 20 needles  at me would you take a needle no would you all right why would i would you take needles to your ears  no why would i do that about uh a needle on both sides of your neck kind of frankenstein-ish 
[00:11:30]  oh that's great you know what kind of important uh blood vessels run up there it's everything that  feeds your brain all right follow me shoving needles in your neck follow me on this because  it's gonna skeeve you out how about a needle to the forehead right in the dead middle no where some  religions put that dot why would you do that would you put them in your kind of like your wrist area  no how about your inner uh calves outer calves kind of shit area that's creepy first of all is it a guy 
[00:12:00]  no it's a chinese doctor and her name means beautiful person no it doesn't something like  that yeah a chinese doctor named norton how about in the top of your feet my friend um no not in the  top of my feet either i believe there were 20 needles this was uh a little stress uh therapy  how about this so now you got the 20 needles right she goes i want to like uh attach them to  some electrodes and run some electricity through all right now i know they haven't been doing this 
[00:12:30]  for thousands of years true they got updated a little bit and what does that do does it make  your muscles go like e-i-i-i-i-i-i no it didn't twitch do you twitch but you feel almost like you got uh  like a like a bee and you're and that area is this do and that area is kind of vibrating and and  she turns it up until you can't take it anymore and then she leaves the room she goes uh meditate 
[00:13:00]  she goes uh uh repeat after me or relax the head relax the shoulders and all the way down your feet  right before i got to my feet out cold my friend next thing i know she's coming in the room like wow  that was fast she goes that was 40 minutes okay so you're telling me you took a nap with needles in  me i guess she got you to take a nap she did what kindergarten school teachers do i feel less  stress and guess what you saw what i did uh as ecstasy of gold was playing my friend 
[00:13:30]  everything relaxed and uh i let go a lot of things oh is that it  let's say hi to uh steve uh long island steve good morning guys good morning anthony you  pee whipped freak of nature what happened uh a staple gun challenge back in the day  but you're afraid of needles you're nicolini eyes that was for the radio show i take a staple 
[00:14:00]  in the leg for the the radio show but i'm not gonna on my off time sit there and get needles stuck  in me i'll get a picture of pinhead yeah well did you look like pinhead i'm hoping know what i'm  hoping for because i've seen like the the needle charts yeah i'm hoping for the uh the acupuncture  needle to the uh to the taint don't tell me there is a um a spot on the body which i don't understand 
[00:14:30]  too it's like oh the uh right earlobe helps your liver right it's like how could that possibly work  actually it has something to do with your feet if you really want to oh with your feet i think that  why not stick the needle in your feet well you stick the needle that takes care of your kidneys  and i'm wondering if they if they put a needle in the wrong place all of a sudden it stops your  heart or something yeah if it's all if it does that much right they better be careful find the 
[00:15:00]  acupuncture chart because there is what's the taint i think it's that what does that do yeah  look at this half naked guy look at that can you actually oh my god they show like wow  that looks like one of those things you buy in a sex novelty shop uh it goes under the name bottoms up  it looks like a lot of latex used to make it but it's called bottoms up i almost didn't even 
[00:15:30]  notice he was naked i see certain stereotypes are true that shot's extremely uh artistic but you  gotta go with me here looks like one kiwi at the bottom of a fruit bowl  so and where is the needle exactly right there i think like i said i got it see now i gotta look  hold on two seconds you want to look on me i'll show you oh okay jimmy  ah god it's dead center on the taint what does that cure can you find out what the needle to 
[00:16:00]  the taint cures probably just like it huh all fun time it's horrid you're having too much fun they  end it that way because anthony it was kind of accurate if you put one in your foot it helps either  your kidney or your liver so if you put a needle in your taint what does that cure and by the way  there's no way they're putting a needle in your taint and someone's saying placebo you're smarter  than that whatever i i was relaxed and uh feeling feeling good after this whole treatment i don't 
[00:16:30]  know i'll give it a shot see what happens i used to get acupuncture and i'll tell you one thing it's  not a placebo uh they've done like all kinds of weird tests where the area that's supposed to be  stimulated by it actually is stimulated right and one part of my thigh used to go numb because  of a couple where the needles were nowhere near my leg but every week this one part of my thigh  i don't know why it was just like a weird side effect of the area they were doing it but it was  you know i got it for a long time it's not a placebo so it was sitting on your leg while he's 
[00:17:00]  oh boy we haven't been here a while that was only uh the u i think that's what that's what the taint  one would cure did you get one i think i only made it to the u the worst one i've got the only one of  the only ones that hurt was on my toe right where the nail on the skin oh my god that's but that's a  torture yeah they didn't do it they didn't ask for secrets they just did it i could have taken  it out if i wanted to you know did you have to do the checklist like all the crap you got wrong with 
[00:17:30]  you like constipation stress all this yeah yeah and they had a whole section on a erectile dysfunction  and i have no problems that area i want to make that perfectly clear but is that where the taint one  is but i almost checked it to see where the needles are gonna go where do they have to go for that  probably on your hands so you stop desensitizing yourself with needles in your fingers well following  anthony's uh anthony's uh uh whatever what like he said you know one in the foot does the liver yeah 
[00:18:00]  i'm babbling here sorry erectile dysfunction i'm thinking next thing you know they're popping  needles in your nose to take care of that problem yeah of course something stupid that doesn't make  any sense how did they figure out okay here's something thousands of years you say tens of thousands  tens even better yeah how did they figure out that something in your foot a needle in your foot  will help your your liver or whatever like what how do they think i think it all is some hokum  that this this guy thousands and thousands of years ago comes up with and goes oh this is connected 
[00:18:30]  meanwhile it's not connected they didn't know anything back then i don't know they didn't know  anything about how the human body worked back then yeah i don't know they this was before drugs i guess  it was before any concept of of your your physical being and how the body works they knew something  about it though i mean don't forget most drugs somehow come from like a combination natural things  in one way or another and michelangelo used to like dig bodies up and open them i mean they had 
[00:19:00]  some understanding well yeah but that was you know yeah that was western that was western medicine  the chinese have always been good medicine have they yeah have they really a billion of them  oh yeah they're doing okay they all live to the ripe old age of 40  it's very quick medicine it works briefly you'll be healthy till you're 40 then you're finished  one step off the curb needles in your toe here oh look at that foot all right this is hilarious all 
[00:19:30]  right so you get a needle in your big toe uh that cures uh helps you with your sinus problem  uh a couple of the little toes will help your eye or your ear uh the little pinky toe will help your  trapezoid muscle so if you stub your toe your nose will clear up is that what i'm i'm being led to  believe i can't why wouldn't that work i'm not gonna lie to you i've kind of thought that exact same  thing that's what freaks me out but if you want to cure um can i say anus problems 
[00:20:00]  sure all right if you want to cure you put a needle just off your heel  and if you want to help uh explosive you know what really uh the tip of your heel  the like the the back the very back yeah that helps explosive uh yeah yeah i think people can  figure that out and then the heart is like the lower pinky toe or little toe like well where the  toe is now in your foot so if someone steps on your little toe uh you could drop dead i don't 
[00:20:30]  know they know nothing all right maybe this is hogwash hogwash is right maybe it's hogwash  poppycock i say you're being a couple of gargoyles  you you raise a good question though but how did they figure it's no it's not it's real but how do  they figure it out is an interesting question yeah i don't know how is it figured out we can talk to  well so long ago yeah well western medicine is incorporating more and more acupuncture into  their into their things i'm not buying it so uh i wouldn't go and here's a little known fact about 
[00:21:00]  me i'm not a big fan of the pill not you know i was gonna say wait a minute pills in general i got  you doing pills in general because they you know i was telling jimmy as we're walking in the area if  natural medicine could cure a few little things like stress and maybe help you sleep better maybe get  you know maybe get rid of the constipation then what the hell because a doctor will go oh can't  sleep here's your ambient uh constipated here's this you know stress why don't you take a xanax or 
[00:21:30]  or whatever i'm i'm not a fan of any of that stuff so if this works great if not i'll get a pill  that's it let's go to robin in detroit piece of crushed grass or root that takes the place of a good  valium no drink crushed grass what was it called crushed what's it called wheat uh wheatgrass wheatgrass  wheatgrass yeah it doesn't take it tastes better than you think i kind of see what cows enjoy about  it it's really good it's very it takes i hear it really does some like major damage on the way out

[00:32:30]  only chicks are going to go see this movie chicks and gay guys this isn't even one that that girls  can drag their guys uh friends boyfriends husbands too it this is so beyond that this is not a chick  flick because all of us get dragged to chick flicks all i'm trust me all of us and you could go not  me we've all been dragged we've all been you dragged to a chick force but the sex in the city  phenomenon it's a it's a girl thing like the girls have to get together with their girlfriends and 
[00:33:00]  make a night of it maybe get a few cosmopolitans and drink a few martinis like the girls do  and get dressed up in the latest fashions oh great i hear this music i want to vomit  the women out there they're going to make a night of it yeah let's go to the trendy let's go to the  trendy restaurant in columbus ohio before we see sex in the city because let's be honest because i  mean everyone's thinking new york new york new york but there's women all over the ball field they're 
[00:33:30]  going to go with their girls so they got to find the like the the trend the trendy spot in in buffalo  and some crap hole right and it's just going to be but they're all going to get dressed up let's go to  the premiere we'll dress up like the girls who do you want to be oh i'm gonna be carrie you be samantha  because you're a slut oh you be carrie because you look more like a horse than any of us  and then they'll go to this and then they'll uh they'll go well why don't we go out for some 
[00:34:00]  cocktails and they'll go hit the local dive yeah and try to pick up guys and think it's going to be  like sex in the city yeah meanwhile they're just going to get ravaged and uh kicked out of the house  oh my god you hear what happened here in new york though oh greatest story greatest story and then  we we got your angle on the whole thing as far as uh what they should be doing with this movie but 
[00:34:30]  first yeah the new york city premiered uh radio city on tuesday night left a few hundred women out  in the rain oops i heard that the broads from this movie they bought all the tickets for their own  premiere yeah so no one was allowed in so all these women got dressed up like the girls to see the movie  and they're standing out in the rain they thought they were going to be red carpeted into the the  radio city music hall yeah uh for the big premiere yeah all dressed up like various the girls from 
[00:35:00]  sex in the city yeah and a lot of them just got left out in the cold yeah and it poured rain i mean  buckets of rain so they're sitting they're standing out there soaked like wet whore rats  just these i love it just these dopes in the rain and uh yeah a couple of girls coming from canada  was it yeah look and they they're dressed up like the girls oh why would they be opie they're going to 
[00:35:30]  the big premiere this story is hilarious that the headline goes four tickets to new york sex in the  city premiere three thousand dollars i guess they they spent three thousand dollars online to get  tickets on the tickets four plane tickets from british columbia four thousand dollars two rooms  five nights at the plaza hotel nine thousand dollars missing the movie worthless they wore sexy high  heels and designer dresses hoping to walk the red carpet like their idol carrie bradshaw  f carrie bradshaw why don't they put on like uh trash bags because we saw a picture of carrie 
[00:36:00]  bradshaw aka sarah jessica parker it's in the paper today it looks like look at this jimmy so it looks  like she's wearing a trash bag you know what even worse it almost looks like a giant diaper  she's wearing a giant full diaper hey that's what i needed the other night  that would that would i would have been able to come to work if i had would have helped you out  if i had sarah jessica parker's dress i think i would have made it to work look at that thing 
[00:36:30]  it's a visual but we'll put the picture up on naradio.com but she's wearing a trash bag like  it it's all like bunched up around the the butt area and the uh and the front area it really  really is awful anyway so these uh these girls they thought they were going to walk the red carpet  like carrie bradshaw instead jen ferguson and her pal devon cross had to lean on umbrellas to ease  the pain in their feet and cower for cover when the heavens open you dummies oh and the fantasies 
[00:37:00]  they must have had the conversations on the phone it's going to be so great we're going to new york  for the sex in the city premiere we're going to dress like the girls we got our tickets right we  got the plane tickets everything's set oh this is going to be so good we're going to walk the car  oh god imagine if we get to meet the girls and they and then at the after party we get invited  because we kind of look real hot like them and we could walk down the street holding hands with 
[00:37:30]  them oh it's going to be great next cue the next scene lightning and they're drenched crying  that they couldn't get in with some homeless guy hitting them over the head with a piece of  cobblestone dragging them off into an alley to be raped dragging them uptown into a empty brownstone  yeah for what was known as hours of terror and sexual assault for the for the sex part of sex and 
[00:38:00]  the city yeah here's the city now here's the sex the city well that's the uh abandoned brownstone and  the sex wow well you're probably not going to like this i just happen to call a few of my buddies  your evening will be memorable though take a team of psychiatrists to get rid of it uh the young women  who arrived in new york on sunday as a gift from ferguson's parents planned on spending five days in  the city to make carrie and her three girlfriends proud so i guess they were going to hit all the sex 
[00:38:30]  in the city spots they checked into the plaza hotel went shopping on fifth avenue and dressed  in designer frocks and heels for their big night at the premiere i'm totally not a dress girl but i've  really tried to harness my inner carrie bradshaw and put dresses on every day said cross her inner  carrie bradshaw would just slap on a feed bag and some shoes some metal shoes  bravo bravo so they were left out in the rain and they're not too happy about it so there's a picture 
[00:39:00]  of them in front of the plaza with uh just uh uh uh what's the what's the look they got a scowl  they're scowling and they're holding up their sex in the city ticket that they weren't able to use  well they could take that home with them yeah good and today's daily news story oh it's just  terrific they got a feature with photos of carrie's killer heels oh well yeah with those talon feet  she's got yeah those eagle feet yeah i'm waiting for an email for my girl because she went and saw 
[00:39:30]  the movie yesterday did she it was one of the lucky ones to go and see it and she was hilarious when she  got home she goes don't worry i'll send you an email so you could kind of just ruin the movie  forever oh the spoilers but i guess i guess charlotte uh in the movie had dies no she gets  explosive you know oh where it sounds like she's power lifting great as she's wearing her clothes 
[00:40:00]  by the way oh they're doing the same story we're doing yeah oh no no sorry brown that's a big brown  big big brown a crack in its heel yeah and so does carrie bradshaw well you know  what what did she marry mr big the brud i don't know i'm gonna find out yeah i gotta find all this  out yeah my my girl's too lazy to give me the fine email that would help the show today i hope something  bad happens to mr big yeah oh um it gets bent yeah like in a door slamming frenzy all of a sudden she 
[00:40:30]  looks and there's like what appears to be a mushroom cap poking through the door where she closed it  uh-oh  um by the way anthony has the solution because they they didn't think ahead with this movie it's gonna  it's it's not gonna do it's gonna do uh okay at the box office but it's not gonna do great numbers  because you're not gonna get guys to go to this movie whatsoever yeah you're cutting half the  population it's like we said to start this break this is a a movie for for women to get together 
[00:41:00]  and go together they don't want their guys to go beyond they're not going to be dragging us this  movie thing beyond chick flick right but anthony's got a solution to that yeah they should uh they  should end the movie with some horrific murders and accidents where they all get killed in like  sam peckinpaw graphically right uh horrific ways see where they get killed because because then  the women would be horrified but they'd already paid their money to see it right uh then they'd 
[00:41:30]  go home and go it was terrible because at the end and then they'd kind of spell out what happened  and then as a guy i'd be like you know i might just go to see that yeah then the word gets out that  it's a it's a lot of action and death and blood and stuff so you got to go now and then ope brought  up the fact that it's the whole movie should be about not so much the girls they're in it but about  a serial killer yeah just totally flipping and the movie's all about a serial killer just killing 
[00:42:00]  these five how many are there four or five four of them i guess and then they're having and and i love  that you can put the whole story together where they're having a girls night together yeah where  they get popcorn and ice cream yeah and getting their jammies and they're talking you know let me  tell you what i did last night blah blah blah and then just this horrible serial killer guy comes in  yeah a sexual serial killer oh of course gotta be yeah think think like uh think uh that brad pitt  movie uh seven seven think seven ted bundy yeah is another one just think seven think harry bradshaw 
[00:42:30]  richard speck think think something like that no i'm thinking seven carrie bradshaw's head in a box  no up on the shelf or in the bed in the window director  that's why hollywood johnny fontaine doesn't get that picture that's why hollywood just sucks because  they would never do something like that but what a twist they would get everybody talking because  everyone's thinking uh they're just gonna they're just doing they're just doing a movie of the series 
[00:43:00]  who gives a crap but if they flipped it like that it would be all the buzz it's funny that you said  that's why hollywood sucks because they won't let the sex and the city girls be raped and stabbed at the end  of the movie exactly you're right hollywood sucks that's such a weird example how could they not  allow them to be but jimmy in a way in a way you understand what i'm saying completely okay and just  not even the least bit funny like kind of oh there's a criminal in the apartment what do the girls do 
[00:43:30]  i want horror i want them to be horrified where the women that are going there to have a good time  to watch the movie and didn't know it was happening are vomiting in the aisles because it's such  graphic violence right on man right on but you'd go see it but the point i'm making is hollywood  can't think out of the box yeah it's going to be the same crap that was that was the series on hbo  with no real real major twist and the broad's a little older but if you really want to disappoint 
[00:44:00]  people i mean really hurt them that almost a serial killer is almost a plot line that could be  interesting i like the idea of she's about to marry mr big yeah all four of them are in the suv on the  way to the church and a dump truck just barrels through a red light and kills them all like all  of a sudden they're on their way this music and you're dead just not even a storyline that could  be interesting just kill them so the women cry and all of a sudden the next thing you see is like 
[00:44:30]  police tape around and they're like four bodies in the street with white sheets over them and the  credits start rolling it's so unsatisfying to everyone oh oh that is good i want such blood  and gore and car chases and stuff that like this weekend all the women go to see the movie next  weekend guys are basically pushing broads out of the way to get into the movie hollering because the word  gets out that it's a movie for them as that dump truck well the first of the first week it makes 
[00:45:00]  say uh 48 million at the box office week two 1150 because everyone's so disappointed just so  disappointed and disgusted i want i want one of the the the girls from sex and city to go the way of my  fourth grade teacher snow plow to the head oh decapitated that'll hurt wow really decapitated and  canada my friends that would be a fine scene in the movie oh i like i like this uh uh bob kelly's 
[00:45:30]  army says final scene camera zooms in on carrie's designer shoe slightly askew just laying in the  road on the double yellow coated in blood just knowing the foot doesn't twist that way unless  you're dead we've all seen those pictures how the fuck get that way oh that person's dead all right  we gotta take a break oh i this is gonna be the greatest thing if you sat through this break god 
[00:46:00]  bless you because now you get a treat uh danny found an unbelievable website it will be up on onaradio.com  so you in case you're driving you can't write this down just remember sarah jessicaparker  looks like a horse.com there you go this will be the website that everybody will be turning others  on to yeah it's a good one uh and we'll have that link on onaradio.com but it's uh sarah jessicaparker 
[00:46:30]  looks like a horse.com it made us laugh really really hard in the office today steve from bayshore  that website sounds hurtful yes steve it is sure it does we'll have the link on on a radio is it up  there yet it's going up right now it's going up there right now so you can just go to onaradio.com  and we'll have that website for you quick break we'll be back on a never surrender  hey this is comedian nick tappalo uh i'll be performing at the trump marina june 14th in 
[00:47:00]  atlantic city with jim florentine for ticket information go to nickdip.com or ticketmaster.com  opie and anthony on your radio dial uh we got bill burrs stopping in today really and i think we 
[00:47:30]  have otto from otto and george as well wow maybe george is also you never know we don't even need  george in here these days otto's just uh gold by himself i think so too like when otto just talks  about his life yeah brings in toys like his silly camera that makes so much noise that he couldn't  load you know the best part is the tape goes right in 45 minutes later he's there with a mallet  tape did not go right in that was that classic and what did he say at his uh uh barbecue again 
[00:48:00]  one of my favorite lines ever is like because he has a little patio he has a really nice place down  in uh kingsburg with his girlfriend and they have a nice uh deck and he has the fattest friend in the  country and they're all on the deck he said there's so many fatties on this deck i have a vision of just  leaning out and handing one of them a radish and the deck just collapsing everybody dying  from a radish oh that had me laughing yesterday absolutely i took it upon myself during the break  i i i'm so into sex in the city now i had a couple of alternate plot lines oh oh jimmy are you actually 
[00:48:30]  writing yes all right we're becoming big boys i know you're actually writing for our radio show  very very brief all right and again i'm a novice at this okay uh scenario one is uh  all four become police officers oh uh they're indicted at the end of the film for beating a man  of color with their baton that would be interesting i would go to see that as a guy yes number two is 
[00:49:00]  without explanation the film opens on a rocket ship taking off and you realize all four of them have  become astronauts the shuttle explodes three minutes into the film the last hour and 57 minutes of the  movie is about the investigation into the shoddy o-ring on the shuttle  perfect and uh my third one is that the uh the wedding bells are ringing oh and uh uh carrie is  left standing at the altar oh boy uh when 20 minutes before the wedding mr big is arrested on the 
[00:49:30]  business end of a glory hole you know i love that second scenario i do too it's my personal that one  is perfect because all these women that that just love sex in the city would go and be like what  they're astronauts okay this has to be some kind of dream sequence before the actual movie stars 
[00:50:00]  and then they die three minutes into it on a tragic explosion yeah of the shuttle and then nothing  but the most technical explanations the most long-winded boring technical jargon about a shuttle  equipment and failure thereof make it like csi if csi was on npr just right exactly not even the  least bit of interesting horrifically boring yeah charts and graphs right and that's why hollywood 
[00:50:30]  stinks right yeah and there's a big scene between like the supervisor and the guy that ordered the  o-ring right the leak and he goes i uh but you told me to save money and he hits the desk not on the  o-rings dan oh am i there oh i am with you on that one hell and just puzzled women sitting there  watching going when does the movie start it would start shifting nervously in their seats probably 
[00:51:00]  like five six minutes into it right right the girls have been dead for three minutes  and it's all just like nasa talk and they'd be like all right this is not a dream this what is  happening yeah boo boo the girls and the funny outfits yeah where was the shoes i mean could you  treat us to more scenarios as the morning goes on i really like the idea of this but that one that  that is a good one please because we're trying to figure out how to get guys to go see this movie  and of course guys would see what you just uh laid out there it would be critically panned 
[00:51:30]  it would get like no stars even guys don't want to see an hour and 57 minutes no technical  just technical talk without any entertainment value whatsoever yeah uh like c-span absolutely we  forgot to play the audio because you know the news is covering the sex in the city premiere listen  it's a phenomenon listen to this sarah jessica parker who we've come to know and love as carrie  bradshaw walked the hot pink carpet tonight arriving in high style her adoring fans even waited in the 
[00:52:00]  rain to catch a glimpse how much spackle was on her to make her look like anything  rain to catch a glimpse moving and touching and lovely and the threatening skies and they  were formidable and stuck it out and uh they've been a dream the fabulous foursome of carrie samantha  charlotte and miranda premiere hold on a second it's the first time the red carpet was uh  dubbed a muddy track  she runs good in the mud  give me her across the board steven s from bayshore oh great each theater is going to be a 
[00:52:30]  clump fest i was saying clump the clump i've been saying clump for the last two days uh linger longer  nick uh see from pittsburgh sarah jessica parker looks more like terry bradshaw than carrie bradshaw  that'll hurt carrie samantha charlotte and miranda premiered on the big screen tonight  this movie has been highly anticipated the cast even shot fake scenes because the plot kept getting  leaked we got a little paranoid but then we couldn't keep it up because we didn't have time in the day 
[00:53:00]  what i don't know and it's so important that the plot don't get leaked oh wow what'll happen i don't  know if it's if it's one of jimmy's movies of course you wouldn't want the plot to get leaked  that's gonna be that's fantastic it's gonna be the same old crap by the way the movie's getting  uh bad review so far is it yeah one one person one reviewer said it just looks like a very special  episode of the series yeah like it doesn't feel like a movie it just feels like one long  like tv movie what does rotten tomatoes give it you know 65 65 ah they're they're not brave 
[00:53:30]  and then uh that'd be good if one of them dropped a rotten tomato out on the floor  that's a big disappointment  after the old kerplock you hear like a you hear a collective sigh from the moment in the audience  and then uh and then this loyal fans line the street outside radio city music hall some even flew 
[00:54:00]  to new york just for the premiere this woman explains why she loves sex in the city i thought  the writing i thought it was hilarious i thought that it was very innovative just the clothes everything  about it i love with their candid talk about love life and of course sex these characters became  pop culture icons carrie provides us insight real insight into what we think and what we love  what oh shut up oh do you hate talk like that do you hate broads she gives us insight look i love 
[00:54:30]  women but i hate broads broads are going to see this broads insight into what yeah what is carrie  bradshaw uh what kind of insight is she giving to women to women that matter to broads she might be  giving some insight yeah let's uh let's say hi to jared in boston he's a regular to the show what's up  jared hey boys good morning good morning uh alternate scene for you there's a racetrack  involved obviously there's your horse joke nice there's a tent as well that's what they have to 
[00:55:00]  put sarah jessica down at the track as she just screams i'm not a horse i'm not a horse and they  don't believe her right uh let's go to max in dallas max hey what's up guys got a scenario for you  all right okay the slutty one what's her name samantha yeah yeah yeah she gets stood up by some  young stud guy because she's a cougar and it starts pouring down rain and she ducks into a warehouse 
[00:55:30]  there in new york and knocks over a crate that happens to be carrying some sort of a virus that  turns her into a zombie so she goes around and starts chopping on the other chicks and turn them  into zombies like five minutes into the movie and then all these army guys have to blow them up and  shoot them and that was i would go to see that wouldn't y'all zombie sex in the city i'm there i got  my ticket you know what i'm calling fandango yeah yeah you just have to do a zombie angle and we're all 
[00:56:00]  going that would be good that's right thank you sir it's too morbid too morbid do you have another  one it's not believable no i have a believable one all righty is uh the girls realize their dream  uh-huh uh about opening a ukulele factory in southern iraq they uh they go there and they call  it four hooves ukulele emporium and they sell a ukulele to a local sheik and it doesn't play well 
[00:56:30]  so he has all four of them executed under a fig tree  at least that's more believable yeah yeah and that's why hollywood stinks jimmy they're not  going to do something like that you gotta flip this movie and then everyone will go see it instead  of just the broads they were actually high on that script but nobody could find a fig tree so they  had to scrap it it got all the way up to the fig tree part oh they actually shot a few scenes  they built the uh the ukulele emporium cost like 40 million dollars it was just a big expense maybe 
[00:57:00]  see it in uh on the dvd yeah they might have some of those lost scenes from the earlier scripts yeah  jimmy you got any more in you hopefully all right as the morning i want them to be believable though  not just junk yeah yeah yeah not just garbage and let's not forget about this great website it's  called sarah it's called excuse me uh sarah jessica parker looks like a horse.com  uh it's up on ona radio uh yeah all right very very good all right uh changing gears for a little 
[00:57:30]  bit we're obsessed with this movie we'll go back to it maybe with bill burr we'll get his take on  this whole uh phenomena with these broads one of my favorite stories we um we have an update  hilarious man last august uh this guy stewart sugarman was attacked during a spin class  at an equinox a spin class this is one of the greatest stories ever ever jimmy oh you don't  really work out in a gym well you work out in your building uh gym and and you get these guys in there 
[00:58:00]  that have to grunt through their workouts and stuff none of that it's all gentlemen there's none of  that because it's not a gym where there's a spin class it's a building gym which is a good size but  it's the size of an equinox well uh sugarman uh claims that another guy listen to this in the  class in his spin class spinning spinning is for for women for the most part of course i don't  really see many guys for broads for broads that are trying to look like harry uh sugarman claims 
[00:58:30]  that another guy in his spin class asked him to stop grunting so loudly so you got a guy he's in  spin class and he's grunting his way through the workout which is just the the worst thing to hear  when you're just trying to like you know get a little exercise you don't want to hear another guy  grunting through his workout you know just doesn't give a crap that everyone else is uh  in this tiny little space with him uh so they argued about it and that's when it got ugly  the angry spinner christopher uh or christopher carter allegedly listen i've never heard him 
[00:59:00]  called spinners before oh well depends on their slight of build  uh allegedly this guy picked up sugarman because he had it with his grunting picked him and his  cycle up his bicycle and threw him against the wall beautiful uh sugarman who had back and neck  surgery after the incident says that he has not been able to return to his vigorous exercise routine  very injured so of course he's uh he's suing he threw me against the wall with my spinning bike 
[00:59:30]  and i lost my shoes but what an animal man wow picks the dude and his bicycle up and throws him  up against the wall and we saw a picture of this guy in the paper yeah he's a big boy he wasn't that  slim no the guy that got thrown is a big boy yeah yeah so we're following that story that just oh he  was yelling there's actually quotes of what he was yelling oh really yeah it says uh the noise is all  part of the spin class culture and it says he just can't help the grunting nor can he help shouting 
[01:00:00]  whoo whoo or great song or good burn or inexplicably you go girl okay starting to get a little more of  insight on the uh this gentleman these are the things that uh steward sugarman is that misspelled  it's supposed to be steward sugar britches what a sweet name was uh was uh was screaming and the  other guy i just couldn't take it anymore the other guy seems like a real tool too but i told him to 
[01:00:30]  shut the f up and the defense lawyer for this you go girl and the other guy probably lost money on the  market that day yeah he's just thinking he's got to hear good song yeah and oh oh as he's grunting  because he's on a spinning bike without a seat  yuck love that story though so what uh sex in the city what they said they had to keep changing the

[01:02:30]  i guess she starts the movie fat well she's oh she starts the movie fat and they explain why  what do they do like a flashback oh great i don't know iraq never is able to explain these things very  well i know you're the greatest point starter offer you your name should be teddy tapers  that's what all your points do taper off to nothing who starts off with a bang and then she got really  fat what happened ah yeah they start off and that's what i got so far well we got more plot 
[01:03:00]  lines is this from steve yeah uh we got uh big and carrie get married after he dumps her at the altar  saraga jessica parker looks like s candace bergen's in this movie i guess and she looks frightening  samantha goes through a midlife at 50 crisis and dumps smith who's smith all right oh dear i'm with  the cougar dr zachary smith that's that would just be silly if they were all lost in space 
[01:03:30]  uh the girls go on the honeymoon together and charlotte uh blanks her pants  uh charlotte has a baby and her adoptive daughter is a bad acting kid  uh i'm sorry maybe it's will smith and um she can't take the pressure yeah i mean she loves  what he gives her she's never had that from a white man but all the nasty emails and notes  and uh she just can't take it miranda and steve break up because she won't put out and has a hairy

[01:05:00]  sense uh uh although there is lesbian line and a close-up on her face and she's disgusted  yeah that's right i should have proofread that all right whatever bill burr's up next print  something out and then read it and no not even read it not even came in running like hot off the  presses yeah i really came in like it was hot off the presses and didn't proofread it and  wow it's a plot it's a spoiler look don't make that face that's horrible it's a spoiler of this show  you're brought in the wrong movie yeah you know he was dead in the room with him the whole time 
[01:05:30]  happens so indiana jones finds the crystal skull not that movie oh has anyone seen that movie yet  no well how was it um getting harder to make indiana jones movies is it it's good it's very  spielberg and george lucas but you know i think that had like a whole time you know you know it's part  of the um i don't know 80s yeah it's part of that whole thing it would be like making 48 hours 
[01:06:00]  again or something yeah it's been 19 years yeah no one wants to see it yeah indiana jones in the  temple of prostate problems who cares about he's an older man stay home relax with your grandkids sit  in a lawn chair just talk about drinking iced tea that's the movie should be about indiana jones  prefers it unsweetened and he's sick there and he sips his iced tea and he asks for a little bit  of lemon and he squirts it in his eye and he reminisces about the days he found the covenant 
[01:06:30]  thing he looked for and his grandkids gets bored and leaves yeah uh let's meth with his friends and  then they steal from the doddering old indiana they take money out of his leathery wallet which  she's left on the nightstand they go out and buy more meth despised indiana jones i didn't see that  now we got wise asses mike from brennan uh mike brennan from babylon writes uh steve read this out  uh read this to opie and then it's just a bunch of letters yes like 40 letters in a row uh katie boston

[01:11:30]  memorial day and went down the beach you see how i look i can't handle the beach and i forgot a hat  so you know i bought the nearest hat i had i understand yeah anthony understands because he  came in with a jill hat uh after it was a j hat it's not with a j on it's a jil nicolini hat it was  her hat but it was a hat with a j on it because it was either that or a pink mets hat or a visor  or something like oh speaking of that answer and quiet answer uh do we officially call it 
[01:12:00]  i've been hearing we officially call it dating what are we calling this well yeah seeing each  other whoa he just said yeah dating time for dating sam get the update oh no that's uh anthony  oh that's great i heard that i have one no no put the take that down come on yeah we have the jill  guard take the jill guard down for god's sake we have uh a part they just see we put up the jill  guard so it's not distracted by the cleavage which by the way is less and less now that  it's dating her because you know the conversations are are happening i haven't said anything to her 
[01:12:30]  about her clothing she should wear anything she wants cleavage down her belly button now she's  looking more and more like a nun no you know you know you know anthony had that talk while cleaning  a gun yeah i noticed you've been dressing very provocatively i did not yeah what's with the  psycho mustache when did you shave off the bottom oh you like that i thought no i thought you had  seen that it's the mustache i'm going for my wild bill hickok look yeah i'm trying to uh i like the  fact that is that or d'artagnan i want some kind of a three musketeers look he is two months away 
[01:13:00]  from a clock tower i don't know i don't know that's not my schedule this is planning that for next  month they'll say what's with the psycho mustache you went oh you like that  you know it's great i didn't even notice and we just had a pleasant conversation i'm gonna try that  some night on stage you suck oh you're enjoying me yeah well you know i've been doing it for 15  years you know after a while you start talking about it you do get some skills up here i had the  dumbest conversation with bobby kelly at the laugh factory the dummy comes in uh he's on his way to 
[01:13:30]  iraq with with dane right he comes in and he talks about how he had a uh actually this made both of us  look stupid right he had he had a pinched nerve so he went to some sort of masseuse and she goes you  know this polish lady he goes after 80 minutes it was still killing me so she goes he goes he took her  old polish hands and grabbed me by my trapezoid is what he called this muscle and i was like his  trapezoid and i'm going too that's not a muscle i go that that's his shape and he goes oh dude it's a 
[01:14:00]  trapezoid i go no isn't it like like the trapezi because i don't know what the hell it was either  and then he kind of had confidence and i can't i had confidence and every other idiot who came  walking in would either agree with bobby yes trapezoid or the trapezi and literally it just  went down to like 10 people on iphones trying to google it what was it might be a trapezoid muscle  it's it it i guess it's called it but people's like the slang is like trapezoid okay so i guess we  were kind of right but i end up looking like an asshole because i berated him for like 30 seconds of how 
[01:14:30]  dumb he was until somebody looked it up it was just like well actually you can't call it the  trapezoid it must look interesting a trapezoid on a circle  so bill are you following the dodgers or are you just wearing the hat because anthony's you know  anthony's uh i am a little bit just because they they got you know derrick lowes there nomar garciaparra  is on there and uh and they got tore but we're not doing that i'm actually he's not doing that great  for the dodgers i'm watching i've been watching the hockey that's what i've been watching  god yeah that's what i've been watching hoping the series they won last night i missed that one 
[01:15:00]  penguins beat the red wings last night yeah but no fights no fights the whole playoff  which sucks it does suck bring back the fight they don't goon it up anymore no no there was uh  there was something i wanted to ask bill and i can't remember now oh my god oh no i just drew a  blank damn it i just drew a let's go backwards here trapezoid psycho i think i'm distracted  because uh you left us what how long have you been in la now uh september so you're all right 
[01:15:30]  a little over half a year you're looking more and more l.a. as you come back yeah you are kind  of getting an la vibe to you now the whole vibe is a little la yeah it's not a bad thing i think  it suits you well i'm just laughing you just gave a talk show you just gave a talk show guest laugh  every time i come in dave every time i come in the first thing opie does i get like two  steps in he goes oh my god look at his shirt he's so la he never used to wear shirts when he lived 
[01:16:00]  when he lived in new york this is this is ridiculous but today like i as i'm putting a hat on i'm like  should i wear this i knew the second i walked in of course the second i come walking it was just like  oh jesus well you're you're a hardcore boston fan i yeah i am and you got you might have the celtics  and lakers uh in the finals but you know i can't watch the celtics like i mean nuts but that's like  old school what they were they went at it what 20 years ago like bird they had bird and johnson yeah  no no no yeah i'm totally into celtic but i i always have to shut them off in the third quarter 
[01:16:30]  they can't they can't put anybody away they just they drive me nuts they'll be up by 20 and you're  like okay now i can relax and all of a sudden you know they just hey let's self-destruct yeah let's  just stand around let's let them get it get it to like four and then they all start freaking  out and everybody just starts shooting the ball like and i'm just like oh i just sit there screaming  at the tv i can't handle it i used to be a huge uh nba fan and i don't know i'm starting to agree  with ant that it's just a waste of time until the last two three minutes of the game i can't i can't 
[01:17:00]  what happened no i actually i look at the other way like the first three quarters fly by and then  all of a sudden time stands still once they get down to the timeouts and people start fouling each  other fouling and then he takes the foul shot and then they go down and then they score and then  the down by 18 you still call a timeout because you could get like a 17 point play yeah just end  the game it's over yeah yeah i gotta go back to anthony for a second so do we have any updates on 
[01:17:30]  anthelini let's see updates updates no no real updates because everyone is just needs info on this uh  um i i will budding romance i'll dole out the info as uh i feel necessary you're sure you're sure  you have nothing you're sure you have nothing mick foley mick foley who's uh you know mankind from  wwe he was over there at uh at the cw 11 doing an interview and then he was coming over here right  afterwards so he came over here and he goes oh i got something to tell you hey can she just like

[01:59:00]  new orleans which was a great cause and then it made me happy people drowned  sorry i needed a joke at the end of that bill is a comedian and that was a joke to try to  entertain our audience i'm sorry man i'll just because they don't understand it out there  you know you guys are getting fired left and right and you don't get you get scared of silence you know  you panic  and i have and i have said that over the years like all of a sudden we'll just admit horrific things  because it's it's either that or dead air so like oh yeah and then i raped her right yeah 
[01:59:30]  but but it wasn't a big thing look i was drunk and you know you don't even excuse  and then you go home like why did i admit that my deepest darkest secret it was uh the foxborough  hot tubs when the saints come marching in or whatever let's go with you too no no we don't  have to hear it now awful thanks iraq what happened with the uh i want to know this dj got 
[02:00:00]  yeah let's do this about kennedy well it's espa uh espa wow uh espn radio host mark madden  i guess he had uh quite the following i guess he was doing very very well for espn well he's uh he's  now done add him to the list of jocks now done never done again uh here you go popular pittsburgh  radio personality in trouble over controversial comments this certainly is not a first but it  appears to be the last straw for espn radio host mark madden the highly rated highly controversial 
[02:00:30]  pittsburgh personality appears to be out of a job over remarks he made about senator ted kennedy  here's what we know the post gazette tonight reporting mark madden has been permanently removed  from the air a spokesman from espn in bristol connecticut will only tell me that madden has been  taken off the air regardless it follows a mean-spirited attack on senator ted kennedy  just days after senator kennedy was released from the hospital diagnosed with brain cancer  madden was quick to spew venom telling his listeners quote i'm very disappointed to hear 
[02:01:00]  that senator ted kennedy of massachusetts is near death because of a brain tumor i always hoped senator  kennedy would live long enough to be assassinated oh good lord oh it's just like a good lord  it's a bad joke it is a wow that yeah you know something though whenever you talk about  assassination yeah of a living uh that's almost like a federal crime yeah yeah that's kind of  i would have gone with the wine them dine them stup them and drown them exactly it's uh 
[02:01:30]  especially he's not he's like he's on sports radio well isn't he it is nice to hear though jack  getting fired and it's not over him saying yeah or or and let's not forget you know those people that  the that can't drive or the that are always committing crimes  um you know what why ted kennedy though i mean he honestly is he that bad a guy i think you should be 
[02:02:00]  able to say whatever the hell you want on the radio we've said this line a million times as long  to follow fcc regulations but ah the new climate uh you know you can't take chances like that why  do they always say people are outraged they're not no one's i didn't hear about it yeah no one's  outrage and if i saw if i heard it i'd be like that was a dumb joke yeah right but in this uh in this  day and age you're gonna get fired for stuff like that unfortunately permanently permanently  removed permanently they seem like he had locked himself in there yeah put the microphone down

[02:19:00]  commercial for magic i remember when i was a kid magic is fun you're dead something like that  we are dead yeah it was some really hocus you might have that it was hocus pocus you're dead  yeah yeah yeah i still don't think they've done the ultimate scary dummy movie yet they still can  do it better you know well you starring rich gums  but the one you did with jimmy i i really like american dummy yes i'd like that a lot

[02:21:00]  having the puppet talk yeah right and and they film that so well where you can see the guy's just  sweating and builds his mind trying to not you know talk that was like his first psycho role pre  hannibal lecter he's a good actor and then he grabs the pocket uh the the puppet and just goes  nuts he's like i can't do this and then uh burgess bites it obviously with the puppet of course those  movies like haunt guys like me like with the twilight zone they people just automatically think you're 
[02:21:30]  insane the puppet tells you what to do i've heard so many weird otto and george and i know otto very  well for many years and then and i've traveled with otto for years and it's so weird the stories  people come up like dude do you hear otto he uh he but he actually has a sock drawer for his  no he doesn't he puts in the case yeah and he drinks until he passes out yeah he doesn't fucking  the puppet doesn't sleep separately in another room you fucking cunt i have no emotional attachment  to prop cunt to anybody i don't know if you guys ever saw the tales from the crypt episode

[02:23:00]  world ever why are they waiting for tomorrow it proves like uh there's life on other planets it  it pretty much uh there is with everything religion and why isn't this the biggest story  coming out of denver video purport uh purportedly showing sorry space aliens to be released a man  wants denver city voters to set up a commission to prepare for visits from space aliens and he plans  to release a video friday that convinced him there is life on other planets jeff peckman uh proposes an  18 member extraterrestrial affairs commission he said his footage shows four foot tall gray aliens 
[02:23:30]  you could see them blink as they looked in a window and panned a room uh peckman said david  broadwell an assistant city attorney asked peckman if he was really serious that's all you have to  do is ask if they're serious are you serious yes all right get the 18 member commission tonight  who makes his living selling a new technology he says reduces the chaos of electromagnetic fields  talked about ufos landing in los angeles and hovering near the white house he said he's never seen an 
[02:24:00]  alien himself peckman needs to gather 4 000 signatures to get the proposal on the ballot  even if he fails peckman said the effort will educate people about the existence of aliens damn  peckman why couldn't he be a fucking surgeon or a fucking lawyer what he works with electromagnet he's a  kook he is a nut yeah our peckman that's a good wall of tronkite word  mr peckman yeah that's what did you think about the tetra fence but don't you think that we got all of 
[02:24:30]  our space uh program from crashed spaceships how do we go from riding in stage coaches in in 70  years to going to the moon we got all our knowledge from crashed uh spacecrafts it's absolutely got to  be the truth that's fucking brilliant i never even thought of that we were walking 70 years ago now we  could fly through space bullshit we got it from the we're not that smart yeah yeah we fast forward a  little too fast with our uh think about it yeah how did we get so smart so fast and every description 
[02:25:00]  of of an alien is always the same it's always the big eyes the long fingers the gray skin it can't be  a coincidence and and all the ufo sightings started right after we started nuclear testing  in the in the 40s so the aliens were now coming closer and keeping an eye on us because we had this  new weapon that could affect them and that's when they started crashing here oh crashing shit this is  like pot talk yeah it was a little now come on it's just for years all those years we pretty much 
[02:25:30]  were the same i mean for for yeah forever for hundreds upon hundreds of years yeah maybe even  thousands but but we're you know relatively the same and then all of a sudden yeah we come up with uh  things you know industrial revolution yeah yeah why why why then the why didn't they have the  industrial revolution 200 years earlier you know the point we've got smarter in 200 years  auto it makes star trek was a five-year mission they've been flying around my fucking tv set for 40

[02:27:00]  it was a balloon you just ruined our whole bit oh well roswell was a top secret  mission where they were monitoring soviet nuclear activity and they were even trying to see if they  could send balloons over to the soviets and deliver a nuke that way if they had to  so high atmospheres balloons well whose birthday was it  a whole roswell thing is just somebody's birthday  my whole space bit is ruined  so what would you float it over and then so what wouldn't be picked up on radar i guess it was a 
[02:27:30]  they actually try that uh the japanese try that to the united states floating bombs over on balloons  balloons and uh because the the air current does move this way so they just released a bunch of  balloons with bombs on them and a few of them actually landed in the pacific northwest uh some  of them blew up some didn't some of them still there just rusting back when they didn't have the  quality uh control of toyota yeah what a sweet cuddly enemy the russians were compared to the 
[02:28:00]  shit that we have now that aids oh i know my god you could actually talk to the russians you know  hey look mutual annihilation cute yeah yeah adorable man they're adorable look ronnie's gonna go over  there and talk about you know pulling missiles out of here if you pull them out of here and now  forget about it there's no talking to those savages sore a head off you remember when rocky  made the speech at the end of four all the russians oh yeah that's when you knew that's when the uh iron 
[02:28:30]  curtain came down i think yeah can we read rocky rocky we like to play that from time to time uh time  to time erog can you find that rocky's awful speech it's fucking it's like you want to i think  inside yourself we have to do a deuce chill speech at the end oh what a donkey on moose and squirrel  you gotta hear the speech and we played uh a while ago they all clap for him steve mastic what's up  how was the last rocky ball ball was that all right not as bad as the other one before the other two 
[02:29:00]  before because he was an older man he fought an exhibition it would have been better if he died  in the ring or yeah lost yeah but it actually got really good reviews yeah it wasn't as bad as i  thought it was gonna be it was actually shot kind of cool died in the ring that'd be awesome i like the  movie he did called paradise alley it was about wrestling in like the 30s but stallone wasn't the  toughest guy in the movie he was like the second you know usually second tough guy yeah his brother  was was tougher than him and that he was kind of like a hustler character that's totally how the last 
[02:29:30]  rocky should have been he should have died in the ring just make it totally realistic he comes out  and gets that shredded was an antonio tyver ding bam just gets knocked out fracture his hip walking  to the ring like a fucking indiana jones movie that golden walker  let's go to steven mastic steve hey good evening good evening hello listen we took a giant leap in  space technology because we got all the german scientists germany had all this rocket technology 
[02:30:00]  way before the united states did anthony you know this yes the jew the jew german scientists  uh we're very knowledgeable uh we did take a lot of them after the war uh before the war though  i don't think uh because germany wasn't allowed to really build a lot of shit credit as a species  yeah how did we how did we come up with that shit in 20 years changed was there was a view anyone 
[02:30:30]  that was a thinker dumb monkeys what have you ever invented with dumb simians  and then there was a change in view they they viewed these people as as the intelligence that  they were and started using them for what they could do and that may be the jump the alien thing  it's kind of a stretch but oh you think so like a bottle rocket with no i don't really you're  gatekeeper you're one of the gatekeepers aren't you leave me yes all right let's go to matt in 
[02:31:00]  pennsylvania matt hey guys i wanted to add on to what anthony was saying about the japanese bombs  over the northwest yes those bombs traveled in the jet stream and that's how the stream was discovered  and also those bombs when they fell one of them didn't detonate until a kindergarten teacher was  up there with a class and it blew up and it killed a couple of the kids those were the only non  uh military civilians killed in the united states by a foreign bomb on u.s soil well how about that i 
[02:31:30]  never heard about that part of harbor they're watching military though wasn't u.s there wasn't  anybody down there going and their son that's a battleship yeah like a guy delivering a pizza or  something yeah it wasn't u.s soil back then oh good point that's right sure oh still just you know  oh hawaii wasn't a state yeah it wasn't yet until the my favorite war was the civil war because you  could take a cab to the front here boy pip okay  sean north carolina wait i want you to know what year that happened what year did the fucking bob did

[02:58:00]  morning and  ended her life  but so many  will remember  how she lived  Diane O'Dell  lived each day  for 61 years  most of them  restricted to an  iron lung  with a philosophy  more people die  of broken hearts  than swelled heads  more than just  words on paper  this was  Adele's way  of life  a legacy  left behind  for her family  and friends  I couldn't  really hear it  though  yeah what was  they said  she said  something  she lived  with a philosophy  which was 
[02:58:30]  that ceiling  tile is chipped  we're near the  end  her philosophy  I couldn't  really hear  let me go back  there  let's see what  we can find  out here  restricted to  an iron lung  with a philosophy  more people die  of broken hearts  than swelled heads  that's right  don't lift the  neck flap  after a gasser  neck flap  she lived life  with a philosophy  never call anyone  a cunt  who could kick  a plug out 
[02:59:00]  how do you  have sex  with that  oh look  at that  disaster  what the  oh she was  facing  she belongs  in space  oh my god  they should have  just like  put her on  display in a  mall  she's living  in a fucking  torpedo tube  and first place  in the costume  contest  as a  laying down  water heater  it's the man  from space  she looks like 
[02:59:30]  she's in one of  those water  massage things  you find at  the mall  in a costume  toothpaste  first place  goes to  oh my fucking  god  what a torture  that is  first place  to the  human depth  charge  depth  charge  just  put her in  one and  fire her  off a  destroyer  watch her  fly through  the air  put her in  a torpedo  tube  I bet you  they got a  battery pack  and then  put her in 
[03:00:00]  the back  of a  pickup truck  and then  her head  would get  air on it  like a  dog  quiet  dignity  I like  to see a  magician  come over  and cut  her in  half  I'll bet  you she  had one  cruel  relative  that would  come over  and just  rest his  sweaty balls  on her  nose  what could  she do  how do  you like  them apples  fucking  cut gassers  in her  face  I would  have had  fun with  her  I would  have made  her smell  my pits  she looks 
[03:00:30]  like a  real pisser  to hang  out with  how long  did she  live like  that  58 years  Jay from  Florida writes  the best  part was  the family  was moving  stuff out  of the  freezer  into  cooler  so it  didn't  go bad  and they  didn't even  give this  bitch a  second thought  wow  and Michael  from Fishkill  Anthelini  number 13  on Google  Trends today  yeah  working it  up  more people  die of  broken hearts 
[03:01:00]  than swelled  heads  more than  just words  on paper  this was  Odell's way  of life  a legacy  left behind  for her  family and  friends  by the way  this story  is brought  to you by  5 hour  energy  thanks 5 hour  energy  for the  free product  that the  listeners are  enjoying on  the bleachers  as one of  the listeners  is playing  spokesperson  he just  went like  this  when I  said 5 hour  energy  and he  pointed to  the display  that we  have out  there  so  she doesn't  really need  it  the reason  they could  not get  the apparatus 
[03:01:30]  that went  around her  is because  she had  a deformity  which wouldn't  allow her to  wear a modern  day apparatus  which was  kind of  spinal deformity  so she spent  her life  in the iron lung  I love this  cared for  by parents  and other  family members  it should have  just said  whoever lost  the bets  though confined  inside the  750 pound  apparatus  Odell managed  to get a  high school  diploma  take college  courses  and write  a children's  book  I imagine  A it should  be dictate  a children's  book  they wouldn't  give her  a college  diploma  because the  stupid hat 
[03:02:00]  would keep  falling off  you put the  big robe  around the  iron lung  she lived  her life  just dreaming  of one day  blowing her  own nose  imagine that's  like an obscure  like rule  you have to be  able to wear  the hat  to graduate  Joe from  Pittsburgh  she lived  with a  philosophy  make sure  you turn  twice a day  to avoid  bed sores  yeah put her  on a rotisserie  we got more  on the story  here  a power  outage  ended her  life early  wednesday  morning  family members 
[03:02:30]  say they  couldn't get  her backup  generator to  work  Odell's parents  now in their  80s cared  for her  they feel a  big void  and when we  moved the  iron lung out  today it was  a little sad  not a little  sad  not alive  we cried  as we were  immediately  repainting the  room and  putting a  flat screen  right there  that thing  must have 
[03:03:00]  really spun  the old  electric meter  too  the power  didn't go  out they  just looked  at the gas  prices  and said  fuck you  beat it  she probably  said one  wrong thing  someone probably  said I want  Obama  and she goes  I'm going  for Clinton  that's all it  took  oh yeah  we'll see  about that  kick  she lived  a full  life  for a  fucking  for an  inanimate  object  she didn't  live a full  life  her life  sucked a  fucking  bowl of  dicks  her life  was awful  how do you 
[03:03:30]  go around  with a  750 pound  piece of  steel around  you and  have fun  where you  going  can I  get on  the  fucking  Matterhorn  bobsled  here at  Disney  I don't  think you're  allowed  she lived  life with  a simple  philosophy  could someone  get in  here  there's  a fly  on my  nose  she lived  life with  a simple  philosophy  take those  new shoes  and shove  them up  your ass  pal  not  necessary  not only  was Odell's  life significant

[03:11:30]  divorce  that is  going to  happen  between  him  and his  wife  that after  brooke talked  about how  heartbroken  she was  and that it  would be  hard for her  father to  repair the  damage  and i see  traffic on  bqe  as i look  down  gwb look  smooth  easy ride  take a  take him  high  upper  level  helicopter

[03:14:00]  to participate  bribe it  thus  in musical  duets with  her  to bribe  rap artists  yeah  he's obsessed  with hulk  hogan  yeah  how do you  not hate  the ultimate  warrior  he's got it  bad for him  that's for sure  the warrior  thinks  her best bet  would be to  spend more time  with her mother  who is now  dating  professional 
[03:14:30]  basketball  players  uh oh  uh oh  perhaps they  have greater  connections  and deeper  pockets  to continue  her talentless  career  this guy's harsh  talentless  ultimate douche  terry couldn't  be happy about  that  that fucking  like you know  a couple of  the rockets  maybe or  perhaps one of  the portland  trailblazers  is deep  dicking  fucking  oh shit 
[03:15:00]  he fucked  the daughter's  friend and  she's like  oh yeah  guess what  i'm gonna  do  watch this  oh is that  what happened  yeah  apparently the  hulkster uh  is that what  they're alleging  i think there's  i don't know  he uh  she's dating  a brook  lookalike  is he  this girl  looks like  her daughter  his daughter  that's pretty  sick  um  listen to what  warrior has  to say about  the warrior  nick hogan  who's in jail  warrior also  thinks  warrior also  thinks  that if  hogan is  going to 
[03:15:30]  oil  anybody's  ass  he should  oil  his son  nick's  ass  wow  that was  worth the  way  the warrior  is a  pisser  that was  worth the  wait  about  four minutes  of shit  to get  to the  old  prison  ass  fucking  joke  that was  a gem  good one  warrior  we gotta  rape  ass  let's replay  that  warrior  also  thinks 
[03:16:00]  that if  hogan is  going to  oil  anybody's  ass  he should  oil  his son  nick's  ass  warrior  warrior  knows  how to  build  a  monologue  prison  cell  there's  very  little  sunshine  you don't  have to  worry about  sunburn  he may  indeed  have very  much to  worry about  when it  comes to  bum  burn  sure  that  jerry  should 
[03:16:30]  be  oiling  nick's  ass  that's  where  he  nailed  it  he got  it  he got  the  point  everybody  got the  joke  and then  he just  continued  talking  that shows  you the  difference  between  a comic  and a  moronic  wrestler  to get  to the  other  side  you see  the chicken  was on  one side  and then  continued  and that  was the  reason  why  wanna  buy a  dryer  door  someone's

[03:18:00]  that  perhaps  he  later  because  he's  taken up  such a  serious  interest  in  mentoring  he  should  provide  some  advice  advice  and  that  advice  would  be  that  if  you  drop  the  soap  in  the  shower  Nick  and you  see it  drifting  drifting  towards  the drain

[03:34:00]  Ricardo  Asperger's  which is a form  of autism  Asperger's  what  that's what they  would make if  they cut him up  and made burgers  out of him  fucking babbling  little shit  that's what  happened  that kid drove  that teacher  nuts  she was probably  trying to teach  him the alphabet  come on  A B C  L  and just  screaming out  he won't  shut up  she made the 
[03:34:30]  kids do the  dirty work  yeah  it's good that  you say he  won't shut up  because this  next clip  she has to  apologize for  the kid not  being able to  shut up  he shouldn't  be in class  he should be  being punished  and hit  last week  excuse me  I'm so sorry  I went to  pick up my  little guy  here  and  he said  mommy  14 kids  voted me  out of my  class  and  he's 22  he's still  in  as soon as  I get home 
[03:35:00]  the first thing  I'm gonna do  is punch  your mama  in the mouth  I like turtles  I love the way  she fucking  says it  so you go  punch your mama  you go in  to talk to  the teacher  and what does  she say  how does  she explain  this  she basically  tells me  everything  she pointed  at my womb  and started  booing  stay late 
[03:35:30]  and hang her  shorts  see this is  the show  now it's  the guilt  show  this is  the show  I remember  now we're  a little  tired  and let  our guard  what happened  when you walked  in to see  the teacher  well I had  a skirt on  and my legs  were open  and she said  could you  close your legs  I can almost  see the  dumbbell factory  basically tells 
[03:36:00]  me everything  she said  that she stood  Alex up in  front of all  of his peers  and one of the  times  she asked  the peers  to tell Alex  what they don't  like about him  and in Alex's  words  it was  tell Alex  what we hate  about you  she asked them  each individually  to have a vote  if Alex deserved  to stay in the  class  or not  for her to  include  five year old  children  and six year old  children  to be able to  say  we don't like Alex  because he eats  crowns  or we don't like Alex  because he hides 
[03:36:30]  under the table  or spins in circles  that's just wrong  and it's not fair  how can you  like Alex  God voted  against him  I love how  she's talking  about this stuff  like it's like  no big deal  so what  he's under the  table  he spins in circles  he shits his  pants  throws it at people  it's a Tasmanian  kindergarten  get out  crayons  so what  he strangles  the bunny  and eats  the crayons  and yeah  I've made an ass  I'm sorry

[03:38:00]  and he just basically  relived the entire  incident over  telling me what  everyone said  and he was  he's devastated  I mean the only  friend that you've  ever made in your  life was forced  into this form of  abuse  it's just  it's  it's saddening  right  right  right  yeah  oh yeah  it's kind of fun  we feel for your  plight  and we're so happy  to expose it  you're stupid  you're stupid  it's so great  to be able to  exploit this  and to make
