<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's F.U. Friday broadcast began with a discussion of Anthony's numerous traffic tickets, stemming from his reckless driving.  He recounted a recent incident in Brooklyn where he illegally changed lanes, receiving only a seatbelt ticket (despite being buckled) by using his press pass.  The conversation then shifted to their upcoming Florida vacation, prompting Opie's anxieties about Anthony's driving.

The show's main focus became their "Most Offensive Song Ever" contest.  Three new entries were announced, featuring overtly racist and sexist lyrics. Opie demanded ten calls from black listeners and ten from women with "smelly snatches" before playing the most offensive songs.  This led to a chaotic segment attempting to fulfill this bizarre requirement, with many callers questionable in their claims or sincerity. The segment was rife with racial slurs and offensive jokes.

A call from Adam Ferrara (mistaken for Anthony's friend, recently arrested for attempted murder and terrorist threats) added to the mayhem. Ferrara clarified the confusion and discussed his role in a Dennis Leary pilot. The conversation circled back to Anthony's driving habits.  They also discussed attending Brian Regan's stand-up show the previous night and a chance meeting with K-Rock staff who expressed their appreciation for the show.  The segment concluded with the hosts teasing the playing of a particularly offensive song, after claiming to have received the required number of calls.  They announced they would broadcast the final hour from La Barbat.

The final hour, broadcast from La Barbat, began with the playing of "The KKK Man," a racist and homophobic parody of "The Candyman."  The song triggered a flood of calls, ranging from outrage to amusement.  Jerome from Harlem threatened to visit the studio. Callers, including a self-identified black Jew, offered diverse reactions, highlighting the song's multifaceted offensiveness.  The hosts acknowledged its offensiveness but defended its inclusion.

Other entries, including "Camp Concentration" and "She Smells Strange," were discussed, along with previously played songs like "Baby Raper" and "Killer Fetus."  Listeners debated which song was most offensive. One caller detailed seeing a large, offensive sign at a WWE event (created by Frank and Mike, who later called in). The hosts mentioned a Mountain Dew sponsorship and a contest to win a trip to the Final Four.  A woman called expressing unrelated anger, followed by a caller who had seen Brian Regan.  "Fifi" then played "What's in My Pants," a game involving genital sounds.

A segment focused on a Canadian voiceover artist who recorded their show's sweepers, followed by discussion of Fifi's suggestive movements.  The hosts then introduced Mike DiNicola and Jay Moore in studio. DiNicola, creator of "Full Blown Aids" (FBA), discussed performing at Caroline's Comedy Club after the song's release, where he was mistakenly believed to have AIDS. Multiple offensive songs were played, including DiNicola's FBA (performed by Stephen Lynch), "She Smells Strange," several Fuel songs ("Camp Concentration" and "Baby Raper"), and "KKK Man" by Joe and Bob.  Callers reacted with varying degrees of offense and amusement.  The hosts repeatedly delayed playing songs to engage in tangents.  They ended the segment preparing to move to La Barbat, escorted by security.  A phone call with Fuel, the composer of several offensive entries, followed.  The debate over the "most offensive" song continued, with "Baby Raper" and "KKK Man" as leading contenders.

The show's final segment featured listener reactions to songs like "Baby Raper," "KKK Man," and "Camp Concentration," with many finding them humorous.  The hosts discussed the sheer volume of entries.  A caller described workplace chaos after hearing "KKK Man" and "Camp Concentration." Manny, a frequent caller, argued "KKK Man" was the most offensive due to the racial climate, despite finding "Baby Raper" funny.  Jerry, a YMCA worker, expressed alienation.  The hosts' chaotic walk to La Barbat was described in detail. Fuel, Bob, and Joey (creators of "KKK Man") were mentioned.  The broadcast concluded at La Barbat, with a boisterous crowd, drinking games, and increasingly incoherent conversations.  The hosts' upcoming vacation was announced.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  We found a girl that can shoot stuff from her private area.  More stupidity on the way.  Right now!  1027 WNEW.  Ah!  Last radio show before vacation.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's F.U. Friday, man.  Ugh.  Goddamn sucks out there.  How you doing, man?  You need to drink a lot of green beer today. 
[00:00:30]  Just so you don't freeze your ass off.  Yeah.  Oh, I got to fix that.  I was watching the parade this year.  Usually I'm out there before the radio show, but this year I'm like, ah, screw it, I'll watch it on TV.  Yeah, it's the best place to watch it.  The weather blows, man.  You see Hillary Clinton getting booed like crazy?  Yeah, what is she?  Goddamn, did that make me feel good today.  And Giuliani's like, well, I just hope she doesn't make a wrong turn down a wrong street and get lost in our city.  I'm trying to say that if she doesn't know New York, like Rudy, like he's always taking little detours down the side streets. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Please.  Any, uh, any F.U.'s you got to get off your mind then, Carol?  Why, you?  Anything?  You leading me on to something here?  Well, it's F.U. Friday.  Oh.  I, um, I don't have any.  I actually, I, I...  Uh-oh.  I actually, uh, made up pretty good today.  We should play a new goddamn game.  And what's that?  Uh, which member of the NYPD will pull over Anthony today? 
[00:01:30]  Get out of here!  You got pulled over again?  Swear to God.  Huh!  Look, I gotta tell you something.  I'm pulled over more than a black man and a Lexus, man.  And, and I...  Are you serious?  I gotta be honest.  You didn't even talk about the office.  I forgot.  It's become such commonplace now.  It's like breathing for me.  We said yesterday that I, I miss being pulled over.  Because, I mean, we were keeping track for a while there.  And now you're way, you're way in the lead.  I got, I got pulled over, I think, when we were still keeping track before I started taking the train. 
[00:02:00]  I think I was up to six times in a year and a half.  And you were like, you were right around that level, too.  But now you have surpassed me.  I am getting pulled over on a daily basis.  And it, it, it, it is all due to this.  I really am driving.  I'm out of control.  I gotta do something.  I am driving like a lunatic now.  Just take your time when you drive to Florida tomorrow.  I will.  I'm just, I'm sick.  Because you know what?  I mean, I, I'm assuming that the, the, the men in blue took care of you once again today.  But, oh, yeah.  If you're, if you're doing all that, that crap down there in the south, you know, I'm not going down there to bail your ass out. 
[00:02:30]  No.  It's only when I'm in the, uh, confines of the boroughs.  Fine boroughs.  That's it.  Then I lose my friggin' mind.  Today, I'm in Brooklyn, driving around.  Um, you know, I, I'm going to be a little late because of the parade and stuff.  Manhattan's a little clogged up.  What sidewalk did you decide to drive on?  No, it wasn't a sidewalk.  You can't make a, uh, a left off of 86th Street onto, uh, Bay Parkway over there in Brooklyn. 
[00:03:00]  So, uh, I see the big sign.  No left turn between 7 and 7.  Okay.  All right.  And I don't want to be the guy waiting there to make the left turn while everyone behind you is beeping going, look, no left turn.  So, right when the light turned green, I went into the oncoming traffic lane.  Now, there weren't any cars there.  Went around a truck, into the oncoming traffic lane of the turn that I made, and then back into my lane, and I'm off. 
[00:03:30]  There you go, right?  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Not a good thing.  No, pulled over.  Cop comes up to the window.  Very nice, courteous guy.  You know, I'm, I'm giving him the speech.  I go, I know, bonehead move.  I go, what can I tell you?  I, I, I'm, I'm in a hurry.  I'm a tourist.  Look at my Boston place.  Oh, my God.  I got the dopey mask plates on.  My dopey mask license.  The registration with no insurance card because they stamp it, and no one understands that.  First time for me in the city office. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I was a little confused with your, with your roads.  I thought I was in Jersey.  I'm in Brooklyn.  All right, so how'd you get out of this one?  So, uh, he goes, all right, I won't write you up for the, uh, turn, the illegal turn.  He goes, but, uh, I'll give you a seatbelt ticket.  I was wearing my belt.  I said, you know, I go, ah, you gotta, he goes, look, it's a lot cheaper and there's no points.  I go, oh, listen to Opie and Anthony.  God damn, you suck.  Dude, I had to play the card.  I never play the card. 
[00:04:30]  I had to play the card.  I always feel if I'm going to play the card, they're going to throw me in jail.  And I got, I got our new press passes that get us thrown out of press conferences.  Yeah.  Dangling from the rear of the mirror.  So I got, I kind of like showed it to him and he's like, oh, wow.  Yeah, cool.  Okay.  He goes, uh, all right, take it easy.  He goes, just, uh, say something nice about the, uh, the NYPD.  I go, I always do, man.  Love you guys.  You guys rule.  See, it's not that we really love you guys, but it's our way of getting out of tickets. 
[00:05:00]  It's Opie is speaking for himself here.  I am a total supporter of the men in blue.  The men in blue need a raise.  And that's because, uh, and you know something?  I think they're, um, being like that to me because we give them support on the air here.  It's not a phony thing.  We don't say it just to get out of tickets.  Thank God it works.  Not many people in the media give the boys props, so.  Nah, I gotta start giving the boys, uh, props on the Long Island Railroad so they can start hooking me up.  What, give you free tickets on the, uh, yeah, that'd be nice.  Then we get the lucky thing where it's like, they haven't come for my ticket yet and they're up to my stop on the train. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, that's always good.  It's like tickets, tickets, you're like, oh no, the stop's one stop away.  Come on.  Yeah.  I almost made it.  Well, that's when you have to run, run and get to the bathroom or to another car real fast.  You just run away from them.  So, hey, thanks, man.  That guy, uh, hooked me up.  Amazing, Anthony.  Amazing.  But I gotta admit, I really have to admit now, I'm driving like a nut.  We all said it.  We've been saying it for years.  Now, 56th, downstairs here, uh, the parade going down 5th, they're blocking up all the streets like crazy. 
[00:06:00]  So I'm having a hard time getting down a half a block to pull into the garage here at our, uh, building.  Uh, do I wait, Opie?  Oh, no.  What do I do?  Um, wait, give me the details again, I'll tell everyone exactly what you did.  I made the left onto 56th, instant stop.  Okay.  The entrance to the garage is between, uh, um, it's in the middle of the block.  Okay.  On 56th.  Right.  Between Broadway and, uh, 7th.  Yeah.  So I'm stuck right there at the corner. 
[00:06:30]  I'm thinking you pulled over and parked because you have the press pass.  Oh, no.  No?  Oh, no.  I parked in the garage, but I had to get there really quick and the road was full.  You went up on the sidewalk?  Oh, yeah.  I drove.  Are you nuts?  I drove on the sidewalk in front of Hooters, in front of the parking lot.  I'm on the sidewalk.  Parking meters to my right.  Swear to God.  You're crazy, man.  We're going on vacation tomorrow.  I already let the cat out of the bag.  You're driving to Florida. 
[00:07:00]  You're driving south.  You pull that crap down there, man.  You're going to be on a chain gang.  I'm not.  It's only when I'm in New York.  We don't have a radio show down south yet, so you're not going to be able to pull the,  Hey, I'm Anthony.  I'm Anthony.  Well, that's all well and fine, boy.  That's pretty good, boy.  Right.  Well, God damn.  I heard your show.  You ought to calm down.  Sing us a song.  Sing us a song.  All right.  Well, congratulations.  Good old. 
[00:07:30]  Speaking of songs, boys are lollygagging around like it's 120 degrees.  120 degrees can't be no more than 114.  Duck that chink a day's paper, napkin' on the job.  Hey, we have blazing saddles gone in the office.  Yes, we did.  But speaking of songs, how many songs are we playing today?  We got three new entries.  We have three new entries to play today?  Three new great songs.  For the most offensive song ever on the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, but we've taken a new direction.  All right, listen.  I love it.  Listen, listen.  There are two out of the three songs.  O.P.  We need a lot of Jewish people to call and say that it's okay to play one of the songs.  And we're going to need a lot of black people to call and say that it's okay to play one of the songs.  Oh, that's going to happen.  Then I'll feel a little better about the songs you're about to hear.  O.P.  What?  What's the name of the contest?  The most offensive song.  Can a song be too offensive to be in that?  Is a runner in a race in the Olympics too fast to run? 
[00:08:30]  Is a skater too fast to skate?  This contest is making me a little nervous.  It's a contest.  It's making me a little nervous at this point.  And we've already gone.  Just wait to hear the takeoff on the Candyman, Anthony.  Yes, I was listening to a little portion of that.  The Candyman can.  And I'm interested in the fact that the direction of these songs have taken a little turn because we've been pretty much on the sex and a fetus angle. 
[00:09:00]  Maybe sex.  Oh, no.  There's flat out racism today.  This is really racist, bad songs.  And they're very offensive.  Flat out racism and one about a smelly snatch.  And might I say, I think contenders.  You think contenders?  The Candyman one is so friggin' offensive.  This could be the most offensive song ever.  Well, that's why we're having the contest.  Honestly, I will not play it unless ten black people tell me it's okay. 
[00:09:30]  Ten black people have to call?  That's all I need.  If ten of the brothers and sisters call and say, look, I have a sense of humor, play the song, then we'll play it.  Hello, this is Reverend Howell.  Play that damn thing.  I'm all right.  But until then, I just consciously cannot push the button to start one of these songs today.  Play it.  Play it or I will punch you in the uterine.  There's two.  I want to hear the song. 
[00:10:00]  Seven more to go.  All right.  Well, and speaking of the most offensive song contest, the song that started it all, FBA, full-blown AIDS.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, is not on the unofficial website.  I don't understand what Steve is waiting for because Steve has all the songs that are in contention up on the website and people can vote for which one is the most offensive.  FBA is not up there, the one that started it all.  Oh.  With the prototype.  We ran into Mike DiNicola after the Brian Regan show last night down there at Caroline's.  And Mike's coming in. 
[00:10:30]  Cool.  The author of full-blown AIDS.  Is he actually fessing up to that?  Yeah.  At first, he goes, you know, at first, you know, he didn't want to fess up to it, but then too many of our listeners were coming up to him, and now he's like, yeah, that was me.  Oh, yeah, now he was all proud and stuff.  But at first, he didn't want anything to do with it.  Of course not.  Now he's all taking credit for it.  And, of course, around 545, we're leaving the radio show today, and we're going to be broadcasting from La Barbat.  Right.  No, that's all right.  People should know. 
[00:11:00]  They need time to get there.  Well, that's a quickie.  We did it last year.  We're doing it this year.  We're going to La Barbat and hanging out and having some green beers with you guys.  But, Ant, before we continue with the radio show, your buddy, your pal, my buddy, my pal, Adam Farrar, is on the line because there's a little controversy in the paper today.  Yeah, I see this.  And we want to clear this up, right?  You want to tell the story real fast, Ant, before we punch down Adam here?  Leonardo DiCaprio's stepbrother.  His name is Adam Farrar.  Yeah.  It's just like my pal's name without the A at the end. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  He was arrested for attempting to murder his girlfriend and making terrorist threats, and he's being held in lieu of one million dollars.  A million dollars.  And there seems to be some confusion over who this is.  Well, it's funny because I was reading the email before the show, and everyone's like, oh, my God, Anthony's childhood friend.  He's in jail for attempted murder.  Oh.  I swear to you, there's more than one that came in today.  Adam Farrar.  Let's talk to Adam. 
[00:12:00]  Adam!  I need this in my life.  Hey there, pal.  What are you guys doing?  How the hell are you supposed to book some gigs with this publicity?  A million bucks.  I'm a little strapped.  I know.  You know, if it was me, you wouldn't even be picking up the phone.  I know.  I had no idea this was going on.  I'm sleeping.  It's at 6 o'clock in the morning.  My cell phone rings, and it's my father.  I'm like, hello?  Are you running, or did they get you?  I go, what, Pop?  What are you doing?  You sound groggy. 
[00:12:30]  Are the balls working you over?  The balls.  I go, what are you talking about?  Your mother said she heard on the radio you're trying to whack somebody.  Oh, wow.  I go, what are you talking about?  How many times do I got to tell you?  Make it look like an accident.  Hire somebody.  What are you doing?  And my mother's in the background.  I heard her go, Joe, I think they said he's a terrorist.  Oh, my God.  Are you a terrorist?  I could see Wheezy getting all pissed off.  I know.  I can't believe it.  He's a terrorist.  When I finally said it was somebody else, my mother starts backpedaling. 
[00:13:00]  She got on the phone.  She goes, I know I didn't raise a terrorist.  I told your father he was crazy.  He doesn't even know who Allah is.  Yeah, so have you been getting many calls about this?  Well, I just, my father woke me up.  My mother made sure I was all right.  And then Rick called.  Adam Farrar.  Yeah.  Without the A.  You're Farrar-a.  Does the guy look like me?  No, not at all.  Thank God.  No, he's, uh...  What did he do?  Looking real palsy with Leonardo there in this picture. 
[00:13:30]  A little step-brotherly love there.  Is that what?  Yeah, attempted murder, man.  He tried to kill the girl.  He tried to kill her with that music?  What the hell did he try to kill her with?  It's like Titanic music there, man.  Did they say how he tried to kill her?  No.  Attempting to murder his girlfriend.  Right.  And making terrorist threats.  What is that?  I don't know.  It doesn't say anything. 
[00:14:00]  They give no details on what he did.  He appeared in TV commercials and series such as Eight is Enough and Battlestar Galactica.  And he was last seen on an Olive Garden commercial saying...  I knew it.  I knew there had to be a bite away in this.  You know, now, whenever I take a gig, I always think, how are they going to break my balls over this?  Come on.  Now, are we allowed to talk about the thing that, you know, that thing? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, in fact, I'm coming in to shoot it.  The first thing.  The thing with the guy?  We can talk about that.  How Italian did you just become?  You know the thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can talk about that?  Yeah, it was in the paper, so I'm cool.  Go ahead.  Let it rip.  Tell everybody what Adam Ferrara, not Adam Ferrara, is up to.  Adam Ferrara.  My pal.  Look at this.  I'm beaming with pride.  It's like the Highlights magazine.  Goofus tried to kill his girlfriend.  Gallant knows not to murder other humans.  Goofus and Gallant, yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, I love those.  So, now, what are you doing, Adam?  I'm coming into town to do the Dennis Leary pilot for ABC.  Yes, look at that.  Look at that.  Network, television, pilot with Dennis Leary.  Sure.  And you're going to be playing what?  Detective Tommy Balthazar.  A cop.  Yeah.  How about that?  How cool is that?  You get to wear a gun and stuff.  Sure, the whole thing.  Sure.  I'm going to be like fish on Barney Miller.  That's not too shabby.  So, when do you start taping that? 
[00:15:30]  I'm actually flying out Saturday.  Look at this.  I'm beaming with pride, my pal.  Look at you.  I can hear the beaming.  Look at you.  Look at you beaming.  I can't believe this.  He's going to be on...  This is network.  ABC.  It's big.  All right, pal.  Hopefully it'll go.  I can come back to New York.  Yeah.  If this series takes off, you leave Los Angeles?  In a heartbeat.  And you're back in New York.  I'm going to leave skid marks.  Will you pull Anthony over if you're playing a cop?  Yeah.  And let me go?  Anthony got pulled over again today, so... 
[00:16:00]  What happened?  I'm getting pulled over on a daily basis because my driving is getting ridiculous.  It's not getting.  I'm driving like...  You ever see...  Remember the chase scene in Bullet?  That's how I drive every day.  I remember...  Well, you remember the bug?  Yeah, I had Volkswagen.  Did you know when he had the bug?  No.  And the Baja bug.  He had a Volkswagen that he built an off-road vehicle.  Yeah.  And just drove off the road.  And drove it, yeah.  He was like driving on the highway.  He goes, you know how many cars can't do this?  And we're going down a divider on the northern states. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  I go, you know why?  You're not supposed to do this.  And the thing fit.  You know, the signs on the parkways?  They got the two big posts and the big signs right underneath.  You went under those?  Well, there was traffic.  There was traffic getting to Jones Beach, right?  As there always is.  Yeah.  Oh, you just leave the roadway.  You leave the road.  Yeah.  You drive under the sign.  Adam, he's still driving off-road these days.  Yeah, I know.  He's very Ted Kennedy that way.  So I get pulled over like every day and then I have to play the card. 
[00:17:00]  And thank God it's been working, you know?  Yeah.  I go, my pal's Adam Ferrara and they let me right off the hook.  Yeah.  You mean the murderer?  Yeah.  Where is he?  So Adam, he gets pulled over.  You would think he would behave as far as, you know, the rest of his driving to the station  goes?  Right.  Ask him how he got into the parking garage today.  How's he getting to the parking garage?  56 was a little clogged.  And I noticed there wasn't, there didn't seem to be much of a traffic problem up on the  sidewalk.  Right.  So I took that.  Stop it.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  He drove right past Hooters on the sidewalk. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, let me tell you, horrified pedestrians.  It was, I waited until the sidewalk was clear when I pulled onto it.  Because you're a gentleman.  Sure.  You don't want to just pull up on the sidewalk while there's people walking there.  Right.  But then some smart ass tries to pull out of the parking garage.  Oh.  The nerve.  The nerve.  So now I'm on the sidewalk so I can't get past them.  Now you've got to wait.  Now there's pedestrians.  What did their face look like when there's a car?  On the sidewalk. 
[00:18:00]  Without even reading the lips, I could tell he was saying, oh my God, there's a car on  the sidewalk.  Yeah, but I think it works today, though, because it's St. Patrick's Day.  So I think people are expecting stuff like that today.  So I pulled, and then I'm yelling at the pedestrians.  I'm like, ah, yeah, okay, yeah, there's a car on the sidewalk.  Yeah, big deal.  And they're all looking at me all pissed.  Is I meddling your business?  You've got to do what you've got to do.  What was that gig we were leaving on the island?  We were on the long side of the road. 
[00:18:30]  Which time?  Jesus Christ.  We were leaving some gig.  It was me, you, and Joe Buck.  And I was driving.  And you go, Adam, we're on the wrong side.  Oh, yeah.  You think I drive bad.  I drive bad, but at least I know what I'm doing while I'm driving bad.  Adam just is oblivious.  Has no clue.  Hey, pal.  Mr. Magoo music starts playing in the background.  Oh, my Georgie.  Which way are we going, Magoo?  We're on the wrong side of the road.  Yeah, but we're making good times.  Road hug. 
[00:19:00]  All right, Pally.  All right, my friend.  Let me let you go.  And good luck.  Let us know when this thing is air, and we'll pump it up.  Hey, you've got a commercial coming up?  How long before your next break?  Oh, off the air stuff.  That's fun.  A few more minutes.  Okay.  Hang on for a while.  Yeah, hold on.  You've got three more minutes of material in you?  You want to fill to the end?  Try out something new.  You want to fill?  A little fill here?  Stretch.  Oh, just wind me up.  We didn't do anything for programming. 
[00:19:30]  Vacation can't come soon enough.  We're the worst of tapes.  That's right.  What are you doing on vacation?  Where are you going?  Florin.  You going to Florida?  Sure.  Why not?  Driving?  Yeah, I've got massive amounts of cocaine to take back.  I can't take that on a plane.  Oh, I still see you're moonlighting.  That's funny.  I don't want to go on a plane.  You know, the swallowing, the condoms, and then the straddling. 
[00:20:00]  They explode inside you.  What was the trip?  Where are you going to Florida?  All over the place.  Oh.  Yeah.  Do you want me to give out my itinerary?  I feel like I'm watching Adam on stage.  He's working the crowd now.  Yeah, and what do you do?  What do you do?  And what do you do?  I'm a student.  I'm a hairdresser from Bayshore.  How long are you guys going to be on vacation?  Just a week.  A week.  That's it.  Are you going anywhere, Ope?  Yeah, I'm, yes, I'm going far away.  I have to fly to my destination.  Yeah, he's got some water to go over. 
[00:20:30]  It doesn't stop you from driving, Ant.  Yeah, yeah, we'll make the ferry.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Now we can take a break.  Okay.  It's Adam Ferrari, everyone.  Hold on, bro.  All right.  And like we mentioned a few minutes ago, we will be doing our last hour of our show from  La Barbat, Anthony.  Yes.  A couple blocks from this location here.  Mm-hmm.  Right on the road.  We'll be there by 6, and we'll stay definitely a few hours.  Yeah.  Drink some green beer with you guys and hang out and stuff, okay? 
[00:21:00]  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  Lots more show to go here.  We have three songs to play in the Most Defensive Song Contest.  We have Mike DiNicola coming in.  Mm-hmm.  Got to talk about the Brian Regan show last night.  Had a lot of fun there.  Hell yeah.  Got to talk about the NCAA.  Hey, Iona looked great last night.  Hey, what was the score?  We'll get into that next.  Stay there.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Booty dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell. 
[00:21:30]  Opie and Anthony.  107-WNEW.  It's FQ Friday with Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  Yeah, we confirmed it.  We will be at La Barbat doing the last hour of our show and then spending at least another  hour there hanging out, drinking beer and stuff.  Bring some shirts down and stuff and just have a good old time. 
[00:22:00]  Right, Ant?  Hell yeah.  So if you're in the area and you want to join us, we'd love to see you.  A little tradition we like doing just before vacation.  Lead the show and do the last hour from the bar getting.  Getting hammered.  Right?  Hammered.  All right, so we went and saw Brian Regan last night at Caroline's.  Goddamn.  This was the first time that Anthony got to see Brian Regan.  I've been telling Anthony about Brian Regan for a long time now.  Flat out, the funniest guy I've ever seen do stand-up.  He works clean, doesn't have any blue jokes, doesn't curse. 
[00:22:30]  And side-splitting the whole damn time he's on stage.  Right, Ant?  Every second.  His act is funny every second.  Not one slow point.  I was laughing.  My sides hurt.  Yeah.  My stomach was hurting.  Oh, I woke up today.  I'm like, what's wrong with my ribs?  It was because I was just losing it last night.  I'm laughing.  You've got to see this guy if you get a chance.  My God.  There may be some tickets left for the remaining shows at Caroline's.  You might want to call him to see, but I'm telling you, I would doubt it. 
[00:23:00]  He only gets to New York a couple times a year, and he's just, he's just, he's the best.  Yeah.  He is the best.  If he can't make it this weekend, just write the name Brian Regan down somewhere.  So, you know, next time he comes to town, you'll book your tickets early because he sells out all the time now.  Yeah.  All the time.  Very funny gentleman.  And then we were leaving the club, and we ran into Mike DiNicola.  He's stopping by.  The author of FBA, full-blown age, should be here in about an hour, Anthony. 
[00:23:30]  He's so proud.  So proud of that song.  Yeah.  And then we were walking to the station, and we ran into a couple of guys from K-Rock, Anthony.  Oh.  I don't want to, I can't say their names because I'll get them in trouble.  What are they?  Because at first it was like they saw us, and we saw them, and they were all tough and stuff.  And then all of a sudden they broke down.  They come right up to me, and they go, hey, man, I got to tell you, not only do I listen to the show every day,  pretty much the whole damn station listens every day. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, really?  So we want to say hi to the K-Rock staff.  They tune in every day.  Right, Rick?  You heard it.  I was there.  They gave us some nice little prizes from their stash in the van.  God damn.  I missed it.  It was funny because they were all, like, looking tough, like, you know, we were going to fight or something.  Like, it was two, like, gangs, you know, walking toward each other.  And then the one guy breaks down and goes, all right, I got to admit, and he pulls me to the side.  He goes, dude, we freaking love your show.  Oh.  And most of the staff over at K-Rock takes a listen. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  Well, they're not going to listen to Will.  I mean, who are you kidding?  I know.  He can trash us as much as he wants.  No one's listening to his stupid show.  So I thought that was kind of cool, right, Rick?  Very cool.  Don't want to give him a name because I think the guy would get in trouble because it seemed like he was a little nervous that he was telling me that.  Yeah.  Knowing that, we'd go right on the radio and say something.  You don't want to get him in trouble, though.  You're right.  Don't do that.  Well, the kid probably makes, I don't know, nothing crap working over there.  All right. 
[00:25:00]  So there you have it.  Then I went to the hotel and checked out the end of the St. John's game, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What?  You dodged a bullet last night.  They had a score with, what, 13 seconds left.  We did?  I know you don't care, but...  No, I'm wondering how...  St. John's doesn't look like a championship team.  It sure didn't look like a championship team last night.  How did Iona do?  Oh, Iona just kicked, kicked ass last night, Anthony. 
[00:25:30]  Did they?  Am I doing good?  Oh.  What happened?  It's safe to say that you only have three teams left.  Three left.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Iona was out of it after two minutes went by in the game.  Really?  What was the score?  Like 23 to 3 or something like that?  In the first eight minutes, it was 23 minutes.  The first eight minutes.  Dude, they looked like the Reginald Denny of the NCAA last night.  Just getting pounded.  Horrendous.  St. John's won.  St. John's won. 
[00:26:00]  St. John's won.  St. John just pulled it out at the last second of the afternoon.  St. John's won.  Yep.  All right.  When does Duke play?  Today?  Duke, I think, plays later today.  UConn plays later today.  No, UConn's on right now.  10-4.  Early first.  Those are my other two teams, UConn and Duke.  Yeah.  You're down to three.  Purdue won yesterday, though, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They've done that.  Very good.  University of Cincinnati, I think they played later today.  Yeah.  I think they won their first game.  Oh, they won their first game.  There you go.  You got two that won. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, come on.  I'm cranking.  When does Hofstra play, Anthony's last pick?  Tonight.  Tonight.  They will get pummeled tonight.  Hey, look.  Come on.  You know the Iona thing with the goof, right?  Oh, yeah.  You know I picked Iona as a total goof.  Oh, of course.  It's Spaz's alma mater.  Of course I'm going to pick it.  Steve, what's going on?  Little joke.  Hey, Steve.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Yeah.  Listen, is Iona like a handicapped school or what?  And I was pulling for you, but listen, I turned on the game. 
[00:27:00]  They were down like 20-some points.  I was like, forget about it.  How many people were watching the Iona game just knowing that Anthony picked it?  They're just sitting there laughing.  Yeah, I was pulling for them, but it was like I could pick five people out of a freaking  nursing home that I played better than that.  Yeah, but St. John's was a little scared there, but they pulled it through, and I got St. John's  all the way, guys.  Yeah, St. John's giving me a heart attack last night because that's the team I want to go  all the way this year, but...  It was just a joke.  Come on. 
[00:27:30]  Iona was just a joke that you're claiming now, Ant?  Yeah.  Why would I pick that, like, crappy team?  And I guess...  I know they were crappy.  I guess Hofstra is a joke, too, huh?  No, no.  Hofstra, I am legitimately pulling for.  Okay.  Come on.  Let's go to Pedro.  Yo, guys.  How are you, Pedro?  Bored as hell.  You're bored?  Why?  I'm listening to you guys.  Oh, come on.  We're doing all right today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're doing all right.  We're almost on vacation.  We're almost on vacation.  We're going to La Barbat today.  You going to be there?  No, I can't make it this time, guys. 
[00:28:00]  No problem.  It's more like a quick, hey, hang out, have a few beers before we go away type thing, so...  I got you.  Listen, I got two things for you.  Yeah.  I was going to the parade on TV.  Yeah.  One of those Rockland Police Department drum and bagpipe cores.  Yeah.  One of the guys on the drums had wow all over his drum.  His drum.  Yeah, I saw that and a bunch of people calling about that.  I want to thank that guy.  He had wow all over his drum kit there, Anthony.  Cool.  If he was a cop, he'd look like a walrus.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Second thing is, I got a big AFU.  That parade was beat.  Well, the weather sucked.  Oh, yeah.  I was just taking a peek as I was hanging out here at the station before the show, and  the best part was when they were booing Hillary like crazy.  Yeah.  Thank God they were doing that.  And then a bunch of gays got arrested.  They got arrested for trying to march in the parade.  Yeah.  Under their own banner.  And they got arrested this year.  Instead of just getting a desk appearance ticket, they're being put through the system.  Oh.  So they will spend some time in a cell. 
[00:29:00]  I don't understand why, you know, we have to allow, like, gays to march in parades.  Mm.  Because then, why can't we make...  Why not?  Why can't we make our own...  Hey.  Why can't we make our own group?  Guys that love lesbians.  Yeah.  Well, that's why they...  And force officials to, you know, allow us to march in the parades.  That's why they...  What's the difference?  ...upheld their, um...  The, uh, law.  Hey.  Hey.  Because you, uh, you'd be able to say that.  Hey, we want to march under a banner of, uh, you know, guys that like to, uh, have sex 
[00:29:30]  with, uh, women.  Yeah.  You know, but, but you should just assimilate into the parade.  If you're a gay guy and want to march in the parade under the, uh, we like to blow bagpipes.  You know?  That's fine.  Sure.  Just as long as it's not under a, you know, a gay banner.  All right.  Thank you, Pedro.  Guys, I got one more thing.  Yeah.  I got a nephew.  Uh, to who?  Uh, everybody.  Everybody?  Yeah, have a nice weekend, guys.  I'm not a friendly, uh, sort. 
[00:30:00]  Hang in there, Pedro.  All right, bud.  All right.  All right.  Now, uh, we need, uh, we need ten people, ten black people to call to tell me it's okay  to play, uh, an offensive song here.  Mm-hmm.  For the most offensive song contest.  Yeah.  So, if we get those ten people, I will play the song.  Ten black people have to give us permission to play a song?  I just, you know, call me a puss, but I just feel it's the right thing to do.  There, to do.  This song is just so over the top.  It really is bad. 
[00:30:30]  And very offensive.  I'll be able to sleep tonight knowing that ten black people said it was okay to play the  song.  Because then when people start calling and complaining, I'll go, look, your old people  said it was okay.  But when you're having a most offensive song written contest, you would want the champions.  The most offensive song.  We've had the fetus song.  We've had the, um, the baby raper.  Oh, my God.  You're talking about a baby raper song.  That's very offensive.  And now this one, which delves into, uh, racism, delves, delves, this thing plunges 
[00:31:00]  headlong.  You see that hole they got on 56 in Broadway?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  You're more than delving.  I'll just feel better if ten black people, uh, give us the permission.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  Yeah.  You're on the radio, buddy.  Who are you?  What's up, dogs?  How y'all doing?  All right.  All right.  What's your name, man?  Yeah, my name is Jarek, yo.  Jarek, yo.  Where are you calling from, Jarek? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, I'm calling from Patterson.  Patterson?  All right.  From Alabama Projects.  All right.  And you want us to play the, uh, the most offensive song that we got?  Yeah, man.  I want to hear what's the best thing I got out there.  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  You're not going to be offended.  It's, uh...  No, no, man.  I heard it all, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I want to see what I got, man.  All right.  That's pretty bad.  It can't be that offensive, you know?  It's serious.  Oh, the N-word is...  That too.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You said F that nigger.  Yeah, I'm a nigga too, man.  I tuck down my 40s, sling the rocks, you know? 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're cursing like crazy over there, Jarek.  Say whatever you want, but don't curse, because we want you on the radio.  Oh, my bad.  My bad.  All right, player?  All right.  All right.  So, uh, you want us to play it?  Yeah, play it nice and loud so I can hear it.  All right.  We'll do that, Jarek.  Thank you for calling.  No doubt.  There's one black guy.  All right, Jarek.  Let me mark it down.  Yeah, let's keep track.  We need 10, and I'll let it fly.  Jerome, what's going on?  Do we even have 10 black listeners?  I don't know.  Call twice.  Hey, Jerome, what's going on? 
[00:32:30]  Yo, what up?  How are you?  What up?  Okay.  Yo, you guys played that I'm going to do Diallo Disney the other day.  You know what I'm saying?  I was like, this won't be any worse than that.  All right.  We're trying to make sure you're black.  You sound black.  Where are you calling from?  Queens.  Queens, yo.  Dog, please.  Jackson Heights.  Jackson Heights.  No doubt.  You sure it's not a white guy?  You're not a wigger, right?  Dude, dude.  What?  Shut up.  All right.  Who cares if it is?  No, plain me like that.  Sounds fine.  All right.  So, Jerome, you don't mind if we play a very offensive song to your brothers? 
[00:33:00]  All right, though.  You guys were like ragging on, I'm going to do Diallo.  Dope.  It can't be any worse than that.  All right.  Thank you, Jerome.  Let's go.  How many homies are we up to?  Just two.  Two.  Two, all right.  Two homies.  Byron.  Yo, yo.  What's up?  What's up?  What's going on?  Now, make sure it's not a white guy imitating a black guy, because I will not have that today.  Yo, yo.  Don't play me like that.  All right.  You're black.  Damn.  No, he's black.  Byron.  Yo, yo.  Yeah, you might be wrong.  I want to ask you to play them song. 
[00:33:30]  All right.  All right.  I'm locking them down.  There's three.  They call me moon crickets.  They call me tarbita.  I don't care.  That's great.  Okay.  Thank you.  How do you spell ask?  Axe?  Yeah.  Axe K.  I think he's white, man.  Come on.  Are you white?  Yo, yo.  No, no, no.  Yeah?  Yo, I'm telling you, I got eight of my friends here that wanted to, but two of them is Puerto  Ricans, but that's okay.  All right.  That's enough.  Throw me a rhyme, then, if you're black.  Yo, you want me to rhyme? 
[00:34:00]  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  Baby, baby, I'll take it and give it to you in the butt.  Let's go, because you're my slut.  I'm going to say, walk down to your ankles, I'll put it in your mouth, then turn you around,  and I'll make you shout, baby.  Yeah!  All right.  I think we have our third brother.  Oh, yeah.  He sounds like a black gentleman.  Thank you, Byron.  Thank you.  Yo, you boys are the best.  All right.  We're getting permission to play the latest, most offensive song, Anthony.  White it on the pills, very dope with that guy.  Nigger Charlie, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey. 
[00:34:30]  It's Nigger Charlie.  All right.  Nigger Charlie, you guys got to play that song and quit trying to turn it into the O&A butt  pirate show.  All right.  I don't know.  You don't sound black enough.  I'm as black as night.  Are you?  He's as black as night, Opie.  You sure, Ed?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm positive.  All right.  We're up to four?  Four homies.  Four homies have checked in and told us that it's okay to play this song, because it's very  offensive, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Bubba Johnson, what's up?  Yes.  How are you doing?  Bubba Johnson? 
[00:35:00]  Bubba Johnson.  Yeah.  And you're an African male?  Yes, I am.  Very good.  All right.  I just want to say that I want to hear that song.  All right.  All right.  Bubba Johnson, thank you.  Thank you.  Don't you dare write it down.  We're still up to four.  I'm keeping track here.  That's fine.  I'm paying attention.  That's five.  No, we're still up to four.  That's five.  No, no, no.  That's not five.  Bubba Johnson.  That guy was as wide as they come, man.  Bubba, how do you know?  Why?  Because of the way he sounds?  You're being stereotypical.  Hey, you're profiling.  You are profiling. 
[00:35:30]  I'm in charge of this segment.  I'm telling you, we only have four brothers we're up to.  If they're going to trick me, they've got to do a little better than that.  Four homies.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  All right.  Hey, since when do you need a nigger's permission to play something?  Oh, my God.  No, you're definitely white.  Of course I'm white.  All right.  We still have four, Anthony.  This isn't going well.  We need ten.  No.  Looking for ten.  Rilo.  This is Rilo, white boy.  Hey, Rilo.  What's going on?  I want you to play that song, man. 
[00:36:00]  I'm sitting here drinking some grape soda and eating some Cheetos, and I want to hear  some offensive song.  There's six.  Hey, come on.  That's not six.  That's six.  Hey, I'm in your house right now.  I'm just stealing a couple of things.  Hey, that sounds okay.  Come on.  Rilo.  Thank you, Rilo.  Oops.  Sorry.  I said a bad word.  Yeah, yeah, man.  All right, man.  Thank you.  I want to hear that song.  All right.  Bye.  You guys are making a mockery of this.  No, I think it's working.  We want ten legitimate brothers calling in to tell me it's okay to play this song that's 
[00:36:30]  really offensive.  Anthony, what's up?  What's up, man?  I'm going to keep it real with you.  I'm half black, half a giant.  So, you know, I got both sides going on.  But go ahead and play it, man.  All right.  There we go.  Go ahead and play it.  There's seven.  Seven homies.  Hey, yo.  I got to ask you to everybody at the same point.  Ask you to count me, JC.  All right, yo.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Peace.  Peace.  Now, you can argue that.  That one, I'll accept.  Opie, I'll accept that one.  You can argue the point there, Opie.  Rob?  Yo.  What's up, Rob?  What's going on, boys?  I want to be on the air.  You're on the air?  You're not on the air. 
[00:37:00]  You got my vote.  You don't sound black, though.  I don't sound black.  No.  I'm black.  What's that?  That's offensive, Opie.  I'm from Westchester County.  That's why I don't sound so black.  You're profiling.  That's eight.  I am saying that.  Rob, how can you prove that you're black?  How can I prove that I'm black?  What do you want me to say?  What do you want me to do?  Thank you, my brother.  Thank you, my brother.  Yeah, right?  Thank you, Mr. White Man.  I mean, what do you want me to say, boys?  And he's black.  I am black.  Yeah, I hear a little blackness in your voice.  Oh, you hear a little blackness.  Thank you. 
[00:37:30]  You guys are so nice.  All right, Rob.  Thank you for giving permission, because this song is really bad.  Oh, is it that bad?  Yep.  It can't be no worse than F.B.A.  Killer fetish?  No, it's really, really bad.  It's bad.  Very offensive.  I think Reverend Al is going to march against this song.  I'll feel much better if 10 brothers give me the okay to play this song today.  Well, I'm on the line with my brother.  I'll have him call you guys, too.  All right, man.  All right, boys.  All right, we've got Daryl Strawberry checking in.  Daryl?  How's it going, fellas?  Hey, what's up, Daryl?  Hey, Sean.  You guys got any cocaine? 
[00:38:00]  No.  Oh, no.  How are you doing, man?  I'm looking for an eight ball.  No, sorry.  How's your colon?  Oh, it's feeling quite lovely today.  Very good.  Any whores?  Quite lovely today.  Have you been banging any whores?  Play this song.  Give me an eight ball.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  No, no.  Come on.  We can't accept that one.  That was, hey, come on.  There's Yankee Great right there.  Daryl Strawberry.  Big Mama Love, what's going on?  Yeah, there's Big Mama Love.  Hey, Big Mama Love.  You guys are making a mockery of this.  You want to hear the song? 
[00:38:30]  No, you better not play that song.  Come here and kick both your asses.  This person isn't black.  We're not going to take your vote.  Hang up on Big Mama Love.  I'm not accepting that.  All right, Bubba.  Hey, Bubba.  Bubba.  Turn your radio down.  All right.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  Yo, I told you I'm calling from the Northern State Correctional Facility.  Yeah.  And you want to hear the song?  Yeah, I want to hear the song.  There it is.  Ten.  That's a curse.  Where did it go?  All right.  All right.

Thank you.  All the peeps, Opie.  All right.  All right.  Got to play it for his peeps.  Leroy.  We got ten.  Leroy.  Hey, Leroy.  Turn down your radio.  You're live on the air, Leroy.

I'm working on the most offensive song, and it's really over the line. 
[00:40:00]  You're going to hear it.  All right.  Well, this contest is starting to shape up quite nicely.  We need some brothers, you know, writing some nasty songs out there.  So it evens out a little bit.  Actually, we got a song from a brother today.  The smelly steak.  She smells.  She smells.  Pretty funny.  So you're going to get ten girls with smelly snacks before you play it?  It might be too funny to be offensive, though.  I just like the song.  You know what I mean?  It's a fine line.  You can't be too funny.  We got three brand new songs we're playing today. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Thank you, Malik.  All right.  No doubt.  Peace.  All right.  I think that was really a black guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure it was.  All right.  Kuta Kinte.  Yes.  What's up?  What's up?  How are you?  Yo.  You're on the air.  Turn down your radio.  Don't listen to your radio, goddammit.  All right.  Sorry.  You're on the air.  What's up?  Yo.  You got to put that song on, G.  All right.  Well, how many more do we have to talk to open?  Come on.  I want some legitimate black guys.  I think we have four legitimate black guys. 
[00:41:00]  No.  I'm counting up to 14 now.  Oh, my God.  It's obvious.  We're just counting the black guys.  All right, KK.  I'll talk to you later, right?  Haywood.  Haywood's on line nine.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  What's up, my brother?  Hey, what's your last name, Haywood?  Jablomi.  I knew that was coming.  What's up?  I'm a black guy calling to let you know you can play the song.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Send the case you know, my brothers.  All right.  Bye.  Later. 
[00:41:30]  Let's go to O.J. on line 11.  O.J.  What's up, my brothers?  Hey, O.J.  This here, O.J.  Hey, O.J.  Call from Cali.  O.P., where the white women at?  You son of a bitch.  Play the damn song already.  All right.  We'll play the song.  Let's go.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Ant.  How many did we get there?  We got ten.  You sure?  I'm positive.  I was marking them off as we went along, O.P.  All right.  The latest entry in the most offensive song contest will be played right after these. 
[00:42:00]  It's a doozy.  Trust me.  Do not turn your radio dial.  Train right in the ring.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  O.P. and Anthony.  102.7.  It's a few Friday. 
[00:42:30]  God, I got to take a leap, man.  Do you?  Yeah.  That coffee sunk in?  Yeah.  Like, I had a go when I first got here.  But I was, like, weighing.  What's more important?  Taking a leap, checking my socks.  Taking a leap, checking my socks.  My bladder's still full.  All right, Anthony.  I guess we got to play this song, huh?  We're doing the most offensive song contest.  I'll just do this a thousand times now, because I got to tell you. 
[00:43:00]  Steve from the unofficial website in the studio, Anthony, he has a new section on the website  where he has all the most offensive songs that are in the running up.  Yeah.  Where you can listen to them, and then you can vote for your favorite.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The link is right on the main page.  A lot of people are complaining.  You got to put FBA up there.  Oh.  Oh, right.  Well, the song that started it all.  Honestly, I can't put it on the site.  Stephen does not want it on the site.  He has made that abundantly clear.  Oh, my God. 
[00:43:30]  So, you know, I'll stick it up there, but, you know.  No, no.  If it's going to piss him off, we can't.  Yeah.  Someone's got to do another version of it.  Yeah.  Well, Mike DiNicola, who's coming in, he wrote full-blown AIDS.  With Jay Moore.  Mostly Mike DiNicola, though.  Maybe he could just do his own version of the song.  Well, we need a little musical economy.  Well, I understand that.  We'll figure something out.  Yeah.  Do an a cappella version of full-blown AIDS.  Right.  What's in the lead?  Even though that's not the way we're going to pick the contest eventually.  Baby Raper's in the lead by a hefty march. 
[00:44:00]  Hefty march, Scott.  I put it up today.  If you go to the page with the poll on it, I think it's 600 votes.  Right.  For that one.  And then 200 behind is the one that the Air Sick guys did.  Kill a fetus.  Kill a fetus.  And then way in the back is the Barry Manilow and the How Much Is That Darky song.  I forgot about that one.  I think they got maybe like 50 votes each.  But the two big ones are the Kill a Fetus and the Baby Raper.  Well, we got three new ones today, Steve.  Really heinous.  And we're going to play one of them right now, I guess. 
[00:44:30]  Speaking of Baby Raper, the guy who wrote Baby Raper and How Much Is That Darky in the Window?  Yeah.  He's got a third entry that we're playing today.  This guy's a genius.  He's a musical genius when it comes to these offensive songs.  He's got a song called Camp Concentration.  So we're going to need some of our Jewish brothers to call before I play that damn song.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.  And then the Smelly Snatch song.  And we're going to have to get 10 women at Smelly to call up to give permission to play that song as well.  All right. 
[00:45:00]  Straight for the jugular, don't they?  Really.  And we're getting at this point at least 10 songs a day.  Yeah.  Some of them just aren't good enough.  Some of the songs are just horrible, horrible quality that we can't even put it on the radio.  And some of those are pretty good, pretty creative.  But if you can't hear them.  But it's really hard to hear.  They're not funny.  Yeah.  You know?  And then others just flat out blow.  You've got to keep this song short and to the point.  Yeah.  Really?  A song being sent to this show that sucks?  I can't imagine that. 
[00:45:30]  I know.  And then all the finalists we're going to have perform their songs at the next road show,  which should happen in the middle of April, it looks like.  I don't know how that guy's going to do the Candyman.  This one is so bad.  Where is the Candyman song?  We're about ready to play that.  So offensive.  Steve, you're obviously coming to La Barbat.  Yes.  We're leaving at, I don't know, like quarter to six and doing like the last hour of the show at La Barbat.  Very cool.  Which is at 5th and 7th Street between 8th and 9th. 
[00:46:00]  We'll be there for a couple hours drinking beer and hanging out and stuff.  And you never know what's going to happen.  We're not planning anything.  It's not like a road show.  But, God damn, we're going to have fun.  Hell yeah.  So, please join us up here in the area, okay?  La Barbat took care of us last year, so we figured we'd go back there.  All right.  Well, Ant, we did hear from enough black people.  Yes, we did.  Ten.  You sure it was ten?  I am positive, Opie.  I was begging for the brothers to call to give permission.  Wanted to show the boys some respect because this is really offensive and over the top. 
[00:46:30]  But you've got to understand that is what the contest is about.  The most offensive song ever.  So, it has to be offensive.  I understand that it might hurt some people.  It might offend some people.  Well, that's what the most offensive song does.  Offends.  Thank you.  All right.  So, who sent this in, Rick?  Do you have any info?  Does anyone want to claim responsibility for this song?  Yeah, this is like a bombing.  Someone's got to claim responsibility. 
[00:47:00]  It's really bad.  Well, we can give the guy a plug after the song, then.  Well, Ant, remember the song when we were growing up, The Candyman?  Yeah.  Done by Sammy Davis Jr., The Candyman Can.  Well, we have a new version of the song here.  All right.  The latest entry and the most offensive song ever heard on the Opie and Anthony show.  Very excited.  A new entry. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, my God.  This could be the most offensive song.  I said that about Baby Raper, but, I mean, this is really offensive.  All right.  It's called The KKK Man.  Remember, these aren't being judged on being funny.  It's not how funny it is.  It's how offensive it is.  Yeah.  And I'm going on record.  This is pretty damn offensive.  How big the lynch mob is outside the studio.  Oh, I know.  And remember, of course, the views expressed in these songs are not necessarily those of 
[00:48:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show or WNEW.  Thank you.  And here it is, Anthony.  But they are of Rick.  Okay.  Here we go.  Here it is.  Hold on to your hats.  Grab your seats.  Buckle.  All right, everybody.  Gather round.  The Ku Klux Klan's here.  What kind of niggas you want?  Burn niggas?  Panic niggas?  Nappy head niggas?  Concrete niggas in cement shoes? 
[00:48:30]  Anything you want.  You come to the right man.  Tom, the KKK Man.  Who's the tank niggas?  Hanging from a tree.  The KKK Man.  Burn niggas and kiss from on and kill his family.  The Ku Klux Klan.  The Ku Klux Klan.  The Ku Klux Klan can.  The Ku Klux Klan can.  The Ku Klux Klan can cause us fuel the world with hate. 
[00:49:00]  And wear a funny white hole.  Wear a funny white hole.  Who can kill Bill Cosby?  The Ku Klux Klan.  The Ku Klux Klan can.  The Ku Klux Klan can.  The Ku Klux Klan can cause us fuel the world with hate.  And wear a funny white hole.  Wear a funny white hole.  The KKK hates all your stupid apes. 
[00:49:30]  From shouting down to Dr. Zayas.  Especially NBA players.  Stack them up like Jews in L.A.  L.A.  The Ku Klux Klan can cause us fuel the world with hate.  The Ku Klux Klan can cause us fuel the world with hate. 
[00:50:00]  And wear a funny white hole.  Wear a funny white hole.  The Ku Klux Klan can cause us fuel the world with hate.  The Ku Klux Klan can cause us fuel the world with hate.  From shouting down to Dr. Zayas.  Especially NBA players.  Stack them up like Jews in L.A.  AIDS-infested niggas 
[00:50:30]  Hanging from a tree  Sets within their race  Dislike bestiality  The kooka's land  The kooka's land can  The kooka's land can  Cause they spill the world with hate  And wear a funny white home  The kooka's land can  Cause they spill the world with hate  And wear a funny white home  The kooka's land can 
[00:51:00]  The kooka's land can  The kooka's land can  The kooka's land can  The kooka's land can  The kooka's land can  The kooka's land can  Okay, terrific.  Oh my God.  I think we'd have a runaway winner.  That's what we said about the baby rapers.  I know, and now, I mean, 
[00:51:30]  Could there possibly be a more offensive song out there?  The phones aren't even ringing.  I think people are in shock, Anthony.  I told you guys, I warned you.  Pete from Brooklyn, instant feedback.  Ding, ding, ding.  Okay, horrific.  This is up there.  A lot of people just saying, this is it.  That is the most offensive song ever.  Jerome, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, white boys?  How are you, Jerome?  Yo, this is Jerome from Harlem World. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, what up?  Yo, that song?  Who wrote that song?  Huh?  Who wrote that song?  What was his name?  Joe and Bob.  Joe and Bob?  Yeah.  Where they live?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  My bad, yo.  I'll tell you something.  Listen, I think we have a contest now.  Yo, yo, yo, my bad.  I won't be doing that, but, uh...  Have you ever heard a more offensive song in your life?  Yo.  Yo, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, you're on the radio, Jerome.  Let's go.  Have you ever heard a more offensive song than that?  Yo, I got my niggas down here in Red Hook. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, we're about to come down to the studio.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Hey.  We're about to come down to the studio.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  We're going to get Mid-Eagle on, yeah.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Hey, we didn't write it.  I warned you guys.  Warned you.  I warned you.  Oh, you're with the curses.  Come on.  My bad, my bad.  Are you a black guy?  Nah, I'm white.  I'm just drinking beers.  I'm very bad.  Yeah, look.  See?  All right, Jerome.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Well, that was a very, very offensive song, and I think it's, uh, in the lead. 
[00:53:00]  Let's go, uh, to Jenna.  Jenna, what's going on?  What the heck was that?  It was, uh, the most offensive song.  That was, that was, that was, just, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now, you don't even have ten black people on.  I was trying.  Your stupid spaz would not get me on.  No, it's, uh.  For spaz's credit, he's out of the state right now.  Yeah, it's the spaz clone, uh, answering the phones today.  Stinky.  Uh, no, no, see, I was wrong.  Are you, uh, a black lady?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Would you have given us permission, uh, before you heard that song to play that? 
[00:53:30]  Hmm.  Probably.  I, I told you it was bad.  I, I try to tell everyone it was bad.  Well, I never heard the other two.  Uh.  So, I don't know.  Well, we got, uh, two more to play today.  Uh, Camp Concentration and She Smells Strange.  See, now, that's horrible, because I'm a black Jew.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  You're just doubly offending me.  And if you smell, then you, uh, you're in all three categories of the songs today.  I said only doubly.  All right.  You can stop there.  We got, we got a song from a brother that's really funny next called She Smells Strange. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  That we're going to play, uh, next as we, uh, play all our latest entries in the Most Offensive Song Contest.  That might be fair then.  All right.  All right, take care.  Okay, the instant feedback.  I mean, pouring in that this is a runaway winner.  The Most Horrific Song Ever.  Makes the Baby Raper sound like a lullaby.  Really?  I'm going to get fired for listening to this.  People checking in.  Uh, this by far the most offensive song I've ever heard.  I think Baby Raper is more offensive. 
[00:54:30]  Tim.  I think so?  Hey, Phillip, what's up?  Hey, it's me.  Um, I'm a black guy I'm calling.  Yeah.  I think the Baby Raper song is way more offensive than this black song.  Really?  Yeah.  The black song was just funny.  That's all it is.  You're a black guy and you thought that last song was funny?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I didn't think it was that offensive at all.  All right, so you still think the Baby Raper song is that worse?  Definitely.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Phillip.  That's here for both of you guys.  You guys are a pussy.  It takes a lot to play this song.  I know.  You're right.  All right.  Thank you.  Uh, Karen checking in.  That was the most offensive song I ever heard. 
[00:55:00]  Kicks ass over Baby Raper.  I'm listening to it with two black co-workers and they are not laughing.  Of course they're not laughing.  That's why I needed the permission of the community to play that song.  And you made a mockery of my vote there.  I wanted ten people to call up to give us permission, Anthony.  Okay.  Uh, this is, uh, Danielle.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm a black woman, no lie, and I'm crying.  I wanted to call you before, but I'm at work and can only hit you on the computer.  My goodness, I am offended.  But is she crying because she's laughing or? 
[00:55:30]  Uh, it says offended yet tickled because that mess was hilarious.  All right.  Uh, Chris, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  I gotta, to go home, I gotta drive through the project.  And I'm driving here, I, I rolled the windows up, I turned the radio all the way down.  Well, thank God it wasn't a sunny day where you just had the windows down, cranking up  the radio show, like, oh, okay, here we go.  Oh, man, it's gonna be riddled with bullets if that happened.  All right, Chris, thank you.  All right, take care, guys.  Bye.  All right, Ant, more instant feedback coming in?  Uh, wanted to know if John Rocker helped pen it. 
[00:56:00]  Let's see.  You should send this to Bob Jones University.  Okay, terrific.  I see, I see Grammy.  All right, Chris, you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  All right, Chris doesn't want to talk.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, you're next on WNAW.  Oh, hey, what's up?  How are you?  All right, how you doing?  Great.  Oh, damn, dude, that was, the worst part about that song was listening to the little  kids in the back singing, okay, okay, oh, crap, I saw I got date paper out of my head. 
[00:56:30]  Now I'm going to be singing a little kid song.  Wow, that was hysterical.  As soon as I heard the song, it's like, oh, crap, put the windows up.  I don't want anybody hearing this.  All right, Matt, thank you.  Thanks, dude.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, Rick?  I just got a page from my wife.  She's offended by the song.  She told me not to come home later.  Get out of here.  Come on.  Is she really pissed?  She's like, that's just disgusting.  You guys are a-holes.  You're lying.  No, no, come on.  We're just playing it.  Doesn't anyone realize that the, look, the idea behind the contest is to offend? 
[00:57:00]  We can't candy coat the most offensive song contest.  How could you have a most offensive song contest and not play the songs because they're too  offensive?  It's a contest to see who could write the most offensive song.  And it's not the most offensive black song.  Now, we have hit many different areas for this contest.  Yeah.  My God, man.  We've offended the abortion people.  We offended the-  Oh, what?  It's okay to suck fetuses out and hear their little bones crack? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  As in the, uh, as in the, uh-  The killer fetus?  The killer fetus song?  Done to Footloose.  That was a catchy little ditty.  That guy's singing was really offensive.  Something tells me he really didn't have to work it right in that either from the way he  sounded.  Yeah.  Something tells me he sits on his porch and just writes that.  He was just waiting for this contest.  It was already penned.  Uh, Tony, what's going on?  Hey, yeah.  You know, um, I'm black.  Yeah.  And, uh, my whole take on this is the guys that wrote this song, I mean, we know where 
[00:58:00]  they're coming from.  Joe and Bob.  They would take the time to write it.  Yeah.  How does ONA feel about this song?  How do you guys feel about it?  I think it probably offends a hell of a lot of people.  It's very offensive.  Yeah.  But that's, that's what we're going for with this contest.  I'm talking about you guys personally.  How do you guys feel about it?  And I'll decide if I'm going to get my car and come down there.  No, I, I, it's obviously wrong, but we're.  I think it's horrific.  But we're trying to, we're trying to like, uh, hit every area here with this most offensive 
[00:58:30]  song contest.  I don't think anybody in their right mind would listen to that song and go, oh, I don't  see a problem with it.  Right.  I, I don't think it's that bad.  It's wrong on many levels.  Oh my God.  But we decided to do this most offensive song contest and you can't sugarcoat it.  You know?  No.  I mean, that's it.  That's true.  Like in the words of the dice, I'm an equal opportunity offender.  And I think, uh, that's what it comes down to.  Well, that's what, you know, we try, that's one of our mottos.  We try to live by that.  I mean, if you, if, if we just read some of the titles of the other songs we've played, 
[00:59:00]  you can see that we are, we're reaching all over the place.  We had an AIDS song called full blown AIDS.  We had an abortion song, uh, kill a fetus.  Yeah.  We had the baby raper song.  One thing I want to see, if this guy wins, I want to see him claim his pride.  He's going to have to go through a gauntlet.  Yeah.  Forget about it.  Okay.  And now the winner's going to perform his song.  Oh yeah.  Uh, live on our stage here during one of the Opie and Anthony Rhodes shows. 
[00:59:30]  Uh, James Earl Jones, what's going on?  James Earl Jones hung up, Anthony.  Where, where was he?  He was very, very pissed off.  Aw, I would have liked to have heard from James.  All right, let's go to Kim then.  Kim, what's going on?  Guys, that is the best song by far.  Hands down.  That was, uh, probably the most offensive song ever.  I didn't think baby raper would get, uh, beaten.  The baby raper song sucked.  The killer fetus song was good.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, you know, if you're going to vote, by the way, I hope you've heard all the songs, 
[01:00:00]  you know, because a lot of people might not have heard the baby raper song.  Okay, maybe not.  We're looking for the people, we're looking for the people that have heard, you know,  all the songs and can make a, a fair decision on this contest here.  I've got to listen to your show almost every day.  Yeah.  Okay, so I think I've heard all the songs.  Are you a black lady?  Yes, I am.  Thank God.  Do I sound white today?  Well, it's just, it's weird, but it just makes me feel a little better knowing that a black lady  thought that song was really funny and offensive, that's all.  Certain things I can't take offense to. 
[01:00:30]  Honestly, I really thought it was funny.  Okay.  And I did laugh at it.  All right.  The baby raper song, yeah.  Yeah.  No, it was creepy.  Yeah.  Oh, and that was, oh my God.  Wow.  I know, the baby raper was really, really creepy.  That I didn't like.  All right.  And I didn't think the lyrics were that great either.  Okay.  But this one, guys, it better win.  All right, Kim, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  We'll take one more call here, Anthony.  Ned, you're next on WNEW. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, how you guys doing?  Great, Ned.  Oh, that's funny as hell.  Yeah?  I mean, it's offensive, but what could be more offensive than raping a baby?  I mean, really.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah, well, somehow we're going to have to vote on this eventually.  We'll have to have some type of criteria, but there you go.  One of the songs that's in the running.  Criteria.  The KKK man done to the candy man.  Very funny.  How much longer are you going to run this contest?  Well, we're going on vacation, and the entries are just starting to pile in.  It took you guys a while to get creative and get your songs in. 
[01:01:30]  So, we're getting like 10 or 12 a day.  We've got two more to play today alone.  I'll keep putting polls on the website if you want.  Yeah, keep the polls going on the unofficial website.  There is another three that just came in.  We just started the show.  Three more songs just came in that we haven't even been able to listen to before.  Yeah, and I've got two more to let it just between three and four into my box.  Yeah, this contest is just exploding, so we're going to have to keep it going for a little longer.  I think we're going to, should we set up a cutoff date for people to get their songs in? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, we'll figure that out after vacation.  We're, you know.  But you'd probably have at least another two weeks to get your stuff in, all right?  Thank you, Dad.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's say, oh my freaking God, my mom just happened to come in when the KKK song was on.  You had to see the look on her face.  It was priceless.  You sure you're still going out later?  Jeez.  Todd, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hi.  You know what?  That was probably one of the most offensive songs I've heard.  Yeah.  But let me tell you something.  Yeah.  It can be beat.  Yeah, knowing our listeners, I think it can be beat. 
[01:02:30]  I've heard some bad songs.  I've got a friend who's written some really messed up stuff, but let me tell you.  I think it can be topped.  I don't think Baby Raper would be beat, but that one, man.  I think that one might beat it.  It's so weird.  Every time we hear one of these, we're like, that's it.  Contests are over.  Most offensive songs.  And then the next one we play, you know, is worse.  Thank you, Todd.  You guys swallow.  All right, man.  Let's go to Ivan.  Ivan, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, O.N.?  Good. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, I was just driving.  I'm at the CWB, about to pay the toll.  The lady was a black operator at the toll booth, heard the song, made me turn it up,  and then she yelled at me for listening to the song.  Yeah, you've got to turn down the radio.  Yeah, what are you, crazy?  Are you stupid?  You're like a man.  No, I had it on normal, and then I said, could I get a receipt?  And then she leaned in, she goes, what are you listening to?  Because she heard, like, the beat.  Yeah.  I put it up a little bit, she's like, that is a fat, what the hell are you?  She's yelling at me.  I'm like, it's a radio show.  Relax, lady.  All right.  Well, we warned you guys. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know what else to tell you, so.  All right, dude.  All right.  Thank you, Ivan.  You guys suck, bro.  All right, man.  That's a comic we saw last night on TV.  Yeah, he was really funny.  We've got to get him in here.  The guy that does the I-1 commercial on TV?  Yeah.  We saw him last night, and he's hilarious.  He does a Saturn commercial still.  Does he?  Yeah.  Chuck from the Radio Chick Show checking in real fast here.  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, man, I'm scared to come back to work, man.  Why?  I don't know if this is the right environment anymore, guys. 
[01:04:00]  I don't know.  That was a goddamn funny song.  I had to leave the studio because, you know, you guys had, like, tall leprechauns out in the studio.  I was afraid after the song, they might want to break out a game of netherball.  That's where you tie a nigga to a pole and bat him around until you run out of rope.  Oh, come on, man.  Jesus, Chuck.  Chuck used that word more than Richard Pryor.  Jesus Christ.  You're trying to claim that word as your own, man.  Well, I made it up. 
[01:04:30]  Well, Chuck, being a black guy, what did you think of that song, our latest entry in the most offensive song contest?  Well, you know, when I heard it, I was sitting in traffic reading my most current issue of Ain't Magazine.  Yeah.  Age-infested niggas today.  Magic Johnson's on the cover.  And, actually, I thought the song was actually pretty damn funny, to tell you the truth.  All right.  It is offensive.  But I've got to go and sing Baby Rafer to my daughter now.  All right.  We'll see you when we get back from vacay. 
[01:05:00]  There he goes, Chuck from the Radio Chick Show, Anthony.  Well, Ant, let's take a break.  And what the hell, we're doing well.  Let's get into another entry.  Another entry, yes.  Right after commercials.  And what's the name of this one?  She Smells Strange.  She Smells Strange.  By Daz.  I can't wait.  We were going to throw this one away, but I said, no, Rick, I really like this one.  Opie, wow.  Pulling it out.  I just like the style this guy's got.  It sounds like an old rap song or something. 
[01:05:30]  I can't pull my finger on it.  Maybe you guys can listen to it and tell me what it sounds like, because it reminds me of an old rap song.  Okay?  All right.  We'll do that next.  Stay there.  Opie, you scum, and Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such demonic little bastards?  1-0-7.  Kick-ass.  W-N-E-W.  Kick-ass.  Kick-ass.  Anthony, real fast, got to talk about Mountain Dew, the official soft drink of the NCAA. 
[01:06:00]  We're going to be sending one of our faithful listeners to the Final Four.  Yes.  We had over 4,000 entries into our Final Four contest.  I just want to thank everyone for signing up for that.  Very impressive.  Mountain Dew is very, very happy.  Yeah.  And one of those faithful listeners will be flying to the Final Four championship, Anthony.  Yes.  Awesome weekend, courtesy of Mountain Dew, the official soft drink of the NCAA.  So do the Dew with Mountain Dew and listen this week for all the NCAA updates, right, Ant? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, they've all registered their picks.  That's over.  And now we see who goes on to the Final Four.  I'm already one down on my three picks.  Yeah, you lost one of your teams yesterday, Iona.  I sacrificed for one of my picks.  Who are we kidding?  Come on.  What do you think?  I'm a total tool?  I almost lost St. John's last night.  That was an unbelievable game.  They came back at the end, but it should have never been that close to begin with.  Yeah.  All my team's still alive. 
[01:07:00]  St. John's, Syracuse, both won.  Duke playing later on tonight, and UConn's playing right now.  I have Hofstra later on.  And Purdue won.  Purdue won.  Cincinnati won.  Cincinnati won, and Iona let you down.  Iona.  Oh, who would have thought?  Who would have thought Iona, that powerhouse of college beatball?  Well, so thank you, Mountain Dew, for giving us this trip to give away.  Very, very cool of you guys.  Yeah.  And go out and get yourself some Mountain Dew.  All right?  Yahoo.  All right, Anthony, we've got to get to the next offensive song here, I believe. 
[01:07:30]  Lisa, what's going on?  Hi, I just wanted to say, the only thing wrong with that song was that it ended.  You guys make, every time someone calls up and they're a nigger, you guys just get so excited.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  What are you talking about, young lady?  Every time.  Are you on a white supremacist?  No.  No, let me just tell you.  Me and my black brothers will come over there and get you.  Let me tell you, my daughter's father is now dating a nigger, and it's a little...  Oh, my God.  We're not going that way with this song.  Sounds like she had a bit of a personal problem. 
[01:08:00]  That's not what the most offensive song is all about, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I know, even Psycho Mark is shocked.  Doesn't it just sound like...  See, that's the difference.  No, I've got to step in.  That's the difference, though.  We're not going that way, all right?  We're having a little fun with the most offensive song I ever heard on the O&A show.  We're hitting all different groups.  A lot of people get pissed off with every song we play.  Yeah.  You know?  But we don't have an agenda. 
[01:08:30]  And it's not about hate.  It's right.  That woman.  It's about lightening up some people.  Damn it.  What the hell is that chick's problem?  You know what it is?  I was just showing some of the stuff that's out there.  That's real life.  Hello?  Hello?  Let it slap you in the face every so often.  It seems that her man ran off with a black woman, and this woman can't handle it.  So, all of a sudden, she's very pissed off.  Jennifer, what's going on? 
[01:09:00]  I'm a black girl that has heard the song on the radio.  Yeah.  And I don't think it's that offensive.  No?  Like, I heard, like, the KKK has, like, a hotline that you can call, and you can listen to, like, the Grand Weather talk.  Oh, really?  I think I've heard more offensive stuff on that than in that song.  All right.  Cool.  I think the most offensive part is the very beginning.  What's the very beginning again?  When they're, like, what kind of nigger you want.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's...  But that's the most part.  The rest of it is, like, funny.  So, have you heard all the entries so far, Jennifer?  Not all of them. 
[01:09:30]  My friend just told me about it today.  She's like, oh, you've got to listen to this.  And then I was listening, and I thought it was kind of, like...  Have you heard the Baby Raper song?  No.  I'm waiting to hear that.  All right.  Well, yeah, we're going to play all the ones that are definitely in the running, you know,  when we get back from vacation again.  But we've got to get to two brand new entries today.  Right.  Two more, I should say.  Well, thank you, Jennifer.  No problem.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Uh, let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  Yo, that song is hilarious. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah?  Oh, really?  Yeah, bro.  I don't know.  I might sound whited and earl, but I'm black also.  Okay.  Yeah.  Hey, tell Linda I said kill Whitey, though.  Uh, Rick's wife?  No, no.  Linda, the one that was on the phone before.  Oh, yeah, I know.  She said, yo, that song is hilarious.  All right, cool, man.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Appreciate the brothers, uh, calling in, understanding that it's a joke.  Well, it's, uh, it's the most offensive song.  Right.  So it's got to be offensive.  Now, will we have another one?  Uh, yes, we do, Ant. 
[01:10:30]  Do we have to talk to these guys real fast?  Are they here?  Mike and, uh, Frank, are they outside?  Yeah.  Oh.  Remember, uh, on Raw this past Monday night, the huge FBA sign with the skeleton?  Oh, yeah.  It was all over the TV?  Uh-huh.  It's here?  Look at it.  Look at it.  That's the famous sign, Ant.  Look at it.  There it is.  We got Steve from the unofficial website.  We'll get some, uh, footage of it, but there it is.  The big FBA.  All right, who's who?  I'm Frank.  Hey, Frank.  And you're Mike.  What's up? 
[01:11:00]  I got to say, I was, uh, sitting on my couch watching Raw's War this past Monday night.  No.  The signage was just incredible.  The wow signs.  Huge.  Okay, terrific.  And all of a sudden, uh, like halfway up on the right side a little bit, right?  Yeah.  As you look at what, looking, uh, looking at the ring, is this huge FBA sign with a skeleton  hanging from the sign.  I, I swear to you, I almost puked.  I was laughing so freaking hard.  I told you, the greatest part of this whole thing was sitting there, I've got a whole family  of little kids in front of me. 
[01:11:30]  They all have these little paper, homemade, the rock signs, this, that, and here I am with  my full-blown AIDS sign.  Yeah.  Awesome.  It was like, what does that mean?  R-O-M-I.  Did other people in the arena know what it was and coming up to you and stopping?  A couple of little chants, yeah.  And we had Psycho Mark coming over pointing at the sign.  It was great, but, uh, couldn't get any more offensive.  Well, I guess we can now, but.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Never say never.  Never say never is right.  Yeah, I don't think people will be bringing signs from that, uh, last song to, uh, wrestling  matches.  Steve from the unofficial website getting footage of the signs so you can put it on the website. 
[01:12:00]  It's a, it's a great sign.  I did get a message, uh, from the devil for you.  He said, uh, first of all, here we go.  He said, uh, be prepared to pay Anthony his money for his grace.  Oh, and if you happen to wind up in hell over your vacation, bring a Parker.  Because it's snowing like that.  Very good.  Freezing over this time of year.  Just about.  Hey, you guys hanging and, uh, coming to La Barba with us or what?  Absolutely.  We'll be good.  All right.  Oh, by the way, um, I don't know if you remember.  Um, do you remember the I Love Camel Toe sign?  Uh, yeah.  Um, I was behind that sign.  Okay.  That was, uh, me and my friend Mike.  I love Camel Toe. 
[01:12:30]  I took a movie poster and kind of wrote it up and flushed it.  We destroyed it so we couldn't bring it down.  I love Camel Toe.  There was a homeless guy downstairs with a FM Talk at 1027 t-shirt flying a remote control  helicopter.  I don't know if you guys know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very funny.  He said to say hi as well.  You're just a regular comedian, aren't you?  Frank's a comedian.  Mike's a comedian.  Mike's a comedian.  I mean, Mike.  Yeah, get it right.  Get it right.  Sorry, man.  What are we doing driving down 86th Street?  I'm from Brooklyn.  Uh-huh.  And you don't drive down 86th Street. 
[01:13:00]  I have business.  Unless you're Pakistani or a cuisine.  I have business to tend to.  I have some Pakistanis to run over.  That's my new mission.  I've done some illegal stuff, but I have never, ever gone onto signs.  He was on the sidewalk.  He was on the sidewalk, too, and that I've never done.  You were actually on the sidewalk on 86th Street?  No, he was on the sidewalk, right outside the building.  On 56th Street.  He was on 8-7.  Right in front of Hooters.  He drove right by Hooters on the sidewalk.  You don't want to run them over.  Let the girls live, guys. 
[01:13:30]  Are you guys going to play the concentration, camp concentration song?  Yeah, we're going to get to that.  First, we've got to play the other one, though.  We're going to play She Smells Strange.  She Smells Strange.  Definitely looking forward to that.  One shout out of her for me?  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks.  If I don't say that, my fiancée, Vicky, she'll kill me, so she's listening, and my dad's  listening for the first time.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  He picked the wrong day to start listening.  My friend Yvonne at work was the only other fan in the entire building, if you get this  station.  All right, Mike.  And I just have to say, go Jericho, go. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Guys.  Well, thank you for stopping by.  Thank you.  We're going to hook you guys up with a ton of stuff, and if you want to hang, we're going  to La Barbat for the last hour of the show today.  Awesome.  Uh, where is that again?  57th between 8th and 9th, Anthony.  Yeah.  La Barbat.  Thanks, TK.  All right.  We'll dig in from my gosh, 6 to 8th.  There they go with that, uh, sign.  That's a great sign, isn't it?  Yeah.  Full-blown 8th.  Jesus Christ.  What the hell is going on?  All right, Ant. 
[01:14:30]  I promise we'll play the next entry next, okay?  Yeah, I got to hear this.  All right.  On the way.  I haven't heard the whole thing yet.  I heard a piece of it.  We have two more, uh, two more songs to get to.  She Smells Strange and Camp Concentration before we leave to go to La Barbat today.  Please join us if you're in the area.  Uh, Steve, real fast.  We've got to take a break here.  Steve?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, how are you?  All right.  I was at the show last night.  Uh, Brian Regan?  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah, he was awesome.  How funny is he?  Oh, he's great.  For a clean comic, he's phenomenal. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  Yo, what was up with Second Mark?  Did it sit at the big boy's table?  Oh, you saw that?  Yeah, he was at my table.  It's right behind you.  Oh, you were that?  Okay.  Why didn't you say hi to us?  Oh, I wanted to leave you guys alone.  No, we don't care, man.  Come on up.  Yeah, Psycho Mark's at his own table.  Well, he did.  Well, what happened was he told us he wasn't coming.  Then he shows up.  We had like a table of eight.  Psycho Mark comes walking in just, just loud as could be, and they put him at your table  with your date or your wife.  Yeah, me and my girlfriend, yeah.  Your girlfriend, and it was like the kiddie table for Psycho Mark. 
[01:15:30]  He had to sit by himself with you guys.  Yeah, but somebody should have gave the...  Dude, I had a shot in the uterus.  She was horrible.  Oh, the female comic.  Oh, my God.  Once again, just proving the fact that we've stated here over and over again, the Chick  comics just blow.  They blow.  Oh, my God.  We've talked about it on the show, and as soon as they introduced her, we all went, we  all went.  Oh, you heard of us all at the table.  It's like, I'm a very funny lady.  Oh, my God. 
[01:16:00]  Well, time to catch up on some conversation and have some food.  Have some food.  Hey, you can't eat your food, right?  Terry Lewis, brilliant man.  Steve, thank God you were a friend of the show, because at one point, Mark is making  like the BJ face and stuff, and that's when you finally said something to him, and I go  to Ann, I go, Ann, I think Mark's going to get punched finally, because I thought you  guys were offended.  No, not at all.  He was playing with that champagne bottle.  I was done.  Yeah, he was giving the champagne of you-know-what, and he's yelling at the female comic. 
[01:16:30]  You guys think Psycho Mark is like, he puts this act on, but he is as real as they come.  He just doesn't give a F.  No, he was real cool.  He was just so funny that he was sitting by himself.  Because he was by himself.  You guys were, you know, you weren't really, you know, talking to him or anything.  Then he made the BJ, you know, gesture, and I'm like, here it comes.  Because you said something.  I thought you were going to say, hey, man, you're offending us or something?  No, not at all.  All right, cool.  Cool.  He was awesome.  You guys are great.  All right, yeah, but Brian Regan, absolutely hilarious.  I don't even know if there are tickets available for the weekend. 
[01:17:00]  You might want to call Caroline's.  No, I jumped on it right away.  Once you guys mentioned it, I totally forgot about it.  I said, I've got to get tickets for the weekend.  We don't go to see many comedians, so that one week we had to.  I tried to get Jay Moore.  I couldn't get in for nothing.  No.  Next time, maybe.  God, he only had 20 shows.  I know.  We all sold out every time I called.  Sold out, sold out, sold out.  Well, next time you just call earlier.  Yeah, I live in Brooklyn, so I was going to drive all the way down there to see if I can get in.  All right, Steve, thank you.  All right, thanks.  Thank you.  And we've got to take a quick break, then we'll play the next entry in the Most Offensive Song Contest. 
[01:17:30]  Very offensive.  And Psycho Mark has handed me another Anthony blooper reel.  You had to record a Rockaway betting spot because we're going on vacation?  At some point, I guess.  And now what?  He pulled some more stuff over.  He's got some more outtakes from you trying to read copy.  Oh, great.  What's the matter, Mark?  I can't even remember which one this is.  All I've got to say is, you're a professional.  Oh, well, you know how I enjoy these things, so.  I am, let me just tell you before, I'm an on-air guy. 
[01:18:00]  I like doing the things on the air.  In the studio, when we have to do these things, it feels fake.  I don't like doing them.  Yeah.  But, you know, I love the product.  I love Rockaway betting.  And when we talk about it on the air, I have no problem.  I'm able to say what I want.  When I have to sit there and read a script and stuff, and the way the salespeople write it sometimes, oh.  It doesn't feel as natural, you know.  Oh, no.  Well, we'll get to the bloopers, the Anthony bloopers, in just a bit here, too.  Looking so forward to another round as Anthony looks like an a-hole. 
[01:18:30]  So much more to do.  So much more to do before we leave the studio and go to La Barbat to have some beers with you guys before we go on vacation.  57th Street between 8th and 9th.  We'll be there from 6th till, I don't know, at least 8 o'clock, if not longer, okay?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Most offensive song.  Another entry.  Next.  This day, if we like to remind you that it's better to be being silent than being a lot of fools, 
[01:19:00]  than to speak and remove our doubts, all the while and still in the coffee.  Oh, I'll make a note of it.  Happy St. Francis Day!  A good day, New York.  I, Mayor Quimby, would like to be your senator.  If elected, I would use your tax dollars to put Opie and Anthony on radio stations across this great land.  Syndication now.  He's back into the world's strongest fat burner.  It doesn't feel like spring's on the way today, but it's coming. 
[01:19:30]  It's coming.  Yes, it is, Opie.  And you're going to want to lose a few pounds before you start getting into the spring clothes, right, Anthony?  Yes.  That's right.  And how are you going to do it?  Forty million Americans are too big, Anthony, and they need the stacker, too.  Uh-huh.  We're hearing from a lot of the faithful listeners that have tried the product in the last year or so,  and they have been very, very happy with the results, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Very happy.  Dropped a lot of weight.  The stacker, too, it does the three things, right, Ed? 
[01:20:00]  Yes, it burns the weight.  It's the world's strongest fat burner.  It builds lean muscle.  And it cuts down on the cravings to snack during the day.  Uh-huh.  And it gives you that boost of energy, a little pep in your step that you need to finish the day.  It adds up to losing weight.  All right.  Check out Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, at www.stacker2.com.  Or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  For Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, thousands have proven it works.  Okay, and that's the video.  What other radio show is going to give you, like, intelligent talk about stock and girls playing What's in My Pan? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNAW.  Reading some of the instant feedback.  A lot of people loving the last entry in the most offensive song contest, Anthony.  Loving it?  Is that really the proper word?  Yeah.  I think getting behind it on its way to victory.  That's one thing.  Because, obviously, it's offensive enough to win. 
[01:21:00]  Uh-huh.  Putting it down as your favorite to win.  But loving it?  Loving it.  Wow.  Listen, instant feedback in from Russ T. Trombone.  Mr. Trombone writes, he's from Jersey.  Whacky.  There was a man from the Freehold Business Association.  He had on a FBA hat.  People were just laughing at him, and he didn't know why.  That's pretty good. 
[01:21:30]  That is pretty funny.  FBA.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next on WNAW.  How you doing, guys?  I want to hear.  Hey, what's up, John?  I found a place where OK Terrific isn't so funny.  All right.  Tuesday night, my wife was taking care of the Hummer Club duties.  Sure.  Giving you a little action.  All right.  Yep.  And as soon as she got done, I said, OK, terrific.  She wasn't very happy. 
[01:22:00]  OK, terrific.  Looks like it might be self-serve for a little while.  Yeah.  Hey, we have some OK Terrific shirts we're giving out at La Barbat.  How many do we have?  Not many, huh?  About 25.  We have about 25 OK Terrific shirts we'll throw out to whoever shows up at La Barbat.  I'm already about 90 miles north of La Barbat.  Well, then we won't see you this time.  It's more just to quickly have a few beers before we go on vacation.  I listen to you guys every single day.  OK, terrific.  From 3 to 5.30 on the ride.  OK, terrific.  Thank you, John. 
[01:22:30]  And you guys take care and communication across the nation.  OK, terrific.  All right, John.  Hey, it is.  Bye.  That never gets old.  Fifi.  Hey, baby.  What's up, Fifi?  What's up?  Are you a transvestite?  I'm a woman.  Don't get a copy.  I was just going to say that.  A voice like that and a name like Fifi.  Uh-huh.  My name is Fifi.  Yo.  You know you like it.  My stage name is Fifi.  You know you like it.  Is it turning you on?  Yeah.  You're a black lady?  Yeah.  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get down with that. 
[01:23:00]  So, what's up?  What was so offensive about that song?  Well, did you hear it?  Yeah, I heard it.  Well, I'm glad you guys are calling and saying it wasn't that bad.  I mean, it's no big deal.  I don't.  I mean, it wasn't even funny.  I mean, make them funny.  That's not supposed to be funny.  No, it's not supposed to be funny.  It's supposed to be offensive.  The next one that we play, it has some comedic value to it.  Well, I mean, you know, it was all right.  I don't understand.  I wasn't really offended by it.  You know, he sounded kind of stupid.  All right.  Well, thank you, Fifi.  You're welcome, sweetie.  Have a great weekend.  You too.  You sound like a guy, yo. 
[01:23:30]  Why?  I don't know.  Well, I'm not.  You sure?  I can prove it to you.  I don't know.  You had that other one come in that one time.  China?  Yeah.  That was fairly convincing.  Charlie, I'm all woman.  All woman.  If you saw me, you would know.  All right.  Well, you know what she sounds like?  Huh?  Warriors.  You best make your way back to Coney Island.  I saw that movie the other day.  That movie's hilarious.  You know what they say about women with deep voices, right?  What? 
[01:24:00]  What?  They got deep something else?  Yeah.  Really?  Well, Fifi, can you want that?  Do I want that, Elaine?  You just might.  Well, Fifi, you want to come down?  We got to check you out.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Hold on a line.  My money's on the fact that you're a guy, or used to be a guy.  Have we ever played What's in Your Pants with a black woman?  No, we have not, Anthony.  We'll have to try that.  You want to play a quick round of What's in My Pants?  Okay.  All right.  Where are you, Fifi?  I'm in Connecticut. 
[01:24:30]  Ooh.  Okay.  I'm at work right now, too.  Is there anyone around?  Yeah, my girl.  Your girl.  Yep.  Are you allowed to, you know, pull down your pants and rub the phone down there, or what?  Hey, Jill, do you mind if I pull down my pants and rub the phone down there?  Yeah, uh-huh.  She's going to turn the other way.  All right.  She's going to turn the other way.  All right.  All right.  Unbuckle the pants and rub them down.  Well, Fifi, what do you look like, first of all?  It's not broken. 
[01:25:00]  Chalk it up, Nathan.  I need a visual, though, Ann.  I look like Little Kim.  Little Kim?  Oh, yeah?  Oh, wow.  Now I'm into this.  Really?  Really.  Do you walk around with one boob exposed?  Oh, sometimes.  Do you have nice breasted juice?  Yeah, pretty nice.  The whole package is pretty good.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  And what are you wearing today?  Well, I have on this black miniskirt, actually.  Some high boots.  Nice.  And a little green shirt for St. Patrick's Day. 
[01:25:30]  Give us a little weight measurement thing.  Oh, about 5'3", 120.  Because your baby got back, right?  You know that, baby.  That's right.  You know that, baby.  Look at that opening.  He knows that.  Baby got that back.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  I've had it since I was little.  All right.  Look at me.  All right.  All right.  You are too white, man.  Now you sound like a brother.  Yeah.  Baby, trust me.  I'm trying.  I want to go black one time. 
[01:26:00]  You'll never go back.  I want to go black.  So, all right.  What's your measurements?  Damn.  Well, 32 waist.  My ass about 38.  What's that cup?  Wait, 32 what?  Breath.  What cup size?  Yeah, like, you're probably like a B then.  32 big.  Okay, good.  My size, you know.  Not too big.  They're real, you know.  Sure.  Nice brown nipples, you know.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, great.  They don't look like Hershey Kisses, do they? 
[01:26:30]  Okay, terrific.  They look more like, um, what's that other one?  The drops.  The drops?  Just the nipple now.  Not the whole thing.  Okay.  I like the slow fade.  The slow fade?  Yeah, like color-wise?  Yeah, the nip goes, like, slowly fades into the breast.  Areola into breastages?  Yeah, that's how it is.  The slow fade?  I don't like, like, where it looks like it's a Hershey Kiss.  We saw a few of those at the last Roadshow.  No offense to the ladies, because I'm sure there's guys that are into that. 
[01:27:00]  We're all into, you know, different things.  But I don't, I, where it looks like it's just a Hershey Kiss in the middle of the breast.  I don't, uh...  You know, this is for the girl who called earlier.  Yeah.  She was pissed.  Yeah.  Because her, uh, daughter's father or whatever was with her sister.  Right.  That sounds like a personal problem, sweetie.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  You can't hold your man.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, she was, uh, very angry, Phoebe.  Yeah, you know, he went black, and now he don't want her.  All right, so you got the black skirt, you got the boots on, you got, uh, what kind of panties there?  I got some red thongs on, actually. 
[01:27:30]  Nice.  Red thong panties.  All right, pull down the thongs.  Okay.  Is your girl there, uh, turning her head?  Yeah, she's, she's got her ear to the radio, because...  Her ear?  Her ear.  Okay.  Her ear.  All right.  Her ear, not her rear.  That's what I said, her rear.  That old guy.  Gying over here.  Okay.  Are your panties down?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Uh, I guess we're ready to play what's in, uh, Fifi's page.  All right.  Remember, Fifi, don't tell us what's in your pants until we ask.  Okay.  No matter what we say.  All right.  Thus not giving us any clues. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  Uh, first, the up and down rub on your most intimate of areas.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  Which way was that?  Up and down.  Up and down.  Okay.  You've got to do it a few more times.  Like five times.  A few strokes.  I think you guys are getting off on that.  Hell yeah.  You know it.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  That's up and down.  Okay.  That's up and down.  Now the side to side motion. 
[01:28:30]  Again, about five times.  Okay.  And now the circular motion, please.  Circular?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Without a doubt.  I have to be absolutely strong.  I would bet a lot of money.  I would bet a lot of money on this one.  I am so positive about this one.  All right.  Positive about what?  We know what type of, uh...  Now, let everyone guess before you say anything, okay? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, don't say a word until we ask you.  Can I...  I have to go first.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Without a doubt, she has Michael Jordan's head in the leg locker.  Do you think it's a wood floor?  Complete wood floor.  All right.  No doubt in my mind.  Now we go to Rick.  I think I'm going to go with, uh, Mr. T.  Mr. T, a mohawk.  Okay.  Uh, unofficial Steve, what would you like to do?  Um, uh, I'm going to say Hitler mustache, actually.  Hitler mustache.  I think so.  I think I'm, uh, I think I'm fairly certain. 
[01:29:30]  Wow.  That is a real bold, uh...  I think so.  Hey, Steve, real fast.  What does Jay Moore call you again?  I was trying to remember.  Mush.  Mush.  Thank you.  Mush.  Thanks, Rick.  I'd forgotten.  And you know how inappropriate that friggin' name is?  Mush.  Mush.  Because I beat him twice.  Mush.  I beat him twice.  Ah.  All right, Ant.  Mush.  Um, I'm going to say...  Fight club right here, Rick.  I am going to say she has, uh, natural, as they call it. 
[01:30:00]  Link?  Just a natural.  Natural triangle.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to say that, uh, she, uh, hasn't really dealt with it as far as shaping up or  anything.  Yeah, link from the Mod Squad's head in the leg lock type thing.  Just leaving the hedges, uh, untrimmed.  Pool rack.  Pretty much.  Filled with afro hair.  Yeah.  Take a pool rack off the pool table.  Right?  Put it in your lap.  Fill it with afro hair.  That's what it looks like.  That's what I'm saying.  Thank you, Carol.  Go, Bill.  Triangle.  Okay, I guess we're ready.  Uh, Fifi, what is in your pants? 
[01:30:30]  Triangle.  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put it shape up nicely.  You know something, Opie?  Um, I was thinking wood floor.  You hear the...  The...  It wasn't loud enough.  I've noticed wood floor is very loud.  What does it sound like here?  Do the, do the circular motion again.  I've got to point something out to Anthony.  Okay.  It didn't sound as much that time, but it sounded the first time she did it, like that squeaking  when you're, like, in gym class and all of a sudden, you know... 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah, I heard that.  Your ball and your belly, like, is on the wood floor and it's kind of like...  I heard that, too.  But what got me was the consistent sound and the volume wasn't too loud.  Because I've noticed the baldies really are loud.  It sounds like a lot of hair.  And then I'm surprised at the mohawk and the Hitler mustache thing, because the consistency  of the sound did not change once.  Yeah.  Side to side, up and down.  It was all hair all the time.  I was thinking either a triangle or wood floor, and I...  I'm not with the wood floor. 
[01:31:30]  You did.  Well, Fifi, thanks for playing What's in My Pants.  All right, guys.  And, uh, hold on the line, because we've got to get you down here.  Okay.  We want to see what you look like.  Okay.  Because part of me still thinks you're a man.  Well, you'll be surprised.  There's a guy on line one, Steve.  He goes, this is a guy.  Yuck.  Come on, Steve.  Oh, that would have sounded different, playing What's in My Pants.  I know, right?  Like going over...  Like going over a speed bump.  Speed bump.  Okay.  Terrific.  All right.  Thank you, Fifi.  All right, sweet.  Hold on the line. 
[01:32:00]  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're next on WNAW.  Hey, guys.  How's it going, man?  Great.  Listen, uh, I play okay, terrific.  I download it off the website on my computer all the time at work.  Yeah.  And we've been having conversations.  We're trying to figure out where it's from.  Did you guys just make it up?  Uh, we just made it up.  It was...  You know what it was?  We'll tell everyone.  You know when you hear those, uh, Opie and Anthony sweepers with the station voice?  Like, Opie and Anthony.  Two A-holes.  On N-E-W.  Well, the guy who does that, uh, we get him on the phone to, to read, you know, stupid lines 
[01:32:30]  for the radio show and stuff.  And then Jimmy does a great job with the production for the radio show.  He puts them together.  The DJ voice guy.  Uh, what?  The DJ voice guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, Jimmy's got the DJ voice guy on the phone.  He's like from Canada or something.  And, uh, Jimmy, like, he had to read all these lines.  And Jimmy goes, well, I guess we're done with you today.  And the guy goes, okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  And, uh, Jimmy isolates.  I said, dude, you got to use this thing.  And we have been.  Do we have the whole sentence that that came from?  Does he go, okay, terrific. 
[01:33:00]  I'll talk to you, you know.  I think he was being sarcastic at the time, too.  Like, okay, terrific.  You know?  It's hysterical.  It's almost adaptable for anything.  We're at work and the boss walks out of the room and is like, yeah, okay, terrific, you know?  Yeah.  But, uh.  Okay, terrific.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Yo, guys, what's in store for our worst stuff next week?  Um, we're trying to keep it fresh.  So, we've been working pretty hard on it.  There should be some good stuff.  Pretty much the highlights of the last three months.  Cool.  All right.  Have a great vacation, guys. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, thank you.  We appreciate that.  The lowlights.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, and A, Fifi has a pair of turntables in her pants.  It sounded like Grandmaster Flash scratching records, didn't it?  At one point, it was making like a...  That was Dennis the Menace.  We've got to give him a credit card.  That sounded more like Grandmaster Gash.  Very good.  A pair of turntables.  Grandmaster Gash.  All right, Anthony, once again, we were thrown off track there.  Oh, my God.  We were supposed to play the latest entry in the most offensive song contest, but Fifi was kind 
[01:34:00]  of cool, right?  You know something?  Let me explain something.  We don't do this on purpose.  When I was growing up, I used to listen to a certain radio show every morning, and he'd  pull this crap all the time, and I said, if I ever did radio, I would never do this.  But we don't do it on purpose.  Promising something, coming up, and then go, okay, oh, well, we didn't get to it, but  we'll get to it right after this break.  And the break, we would come back from the break, not even talk about what we said we  would go to.  And then at the end of that break, when we're ready to go into another break, go, oh, we  didn't get to it.  I know, but at least...  Oh, and I hated that as I was listening. 
[01:34:30]  Know what the difference is, though?  What?  He used to milk it for a week.  We're just milking it for an hour, and not on purpose, because we go off on these tangents.  Yeah, that's true.  Anthony, right after commercials, swear to you, we play the latest entry in the most offensive  song contest, a song by Daz called She Smells Strange.  Okay, terrific.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, stupid, wow. 
[01:35:00]  Boop, boop, boop.  Or stupidity on the way.  Thanks.  One, two, seven.  WNEW.  Fire, stop, stop.  Prodigy.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Daddy, Friday.  Oh, yeah, wait, wait.  I don't have it there.  Hey, hey, hey.  Why isn't that on my little wacky machine? 
[01:35:30]  Come on, Rick.  Well, when you get back from vacation, we're going to get you a bunch of brand new sounds.  Yeah.  The Scott Muni, virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Okay.  I got this beer, too.  All right.  See, the...  All right.  People are...  We don't need any more beer, people.  We have so much beer.  It's not even funny.  Beer.  Anthony, Mike DiNicola. 
[01:36:00]  I see.  In the studio, Jay Moore's buddy there.  And he actually can get three words in edgewise today.  Yeah, Mike DiNicola.  Amazing.  A comic that does quite well on his own.  Yeah.  He shows up with Jay Moore every time Jay's here and he doesn't get to talk because Jay  pretty much takes over the radio show.  That's pretty much how it goes.  When Jay's here, I think we turn it into the Jay Moore show.  Yeah.  He's going to have his own sweepers next time he visits.  All Jay.  All day.  On N-E-W.  Jay Moore. 
[01:36:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  W-N-E-W.  Buddy, what's up, Mike?  I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity now.  Yeah.  And I'll tell you why.  Mike DiNicola, the author of Full Blown Aids.  Full Blown Aids.  FBA, as it's been known.  Now, what has happened to your career since penning the hit FBA?  Well, you remember.  Since preparing on Star Search.  Yeah.  Where you sang FBA.  It all started.  I feel like we're doing a biography.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Behind the music.  He was telling me a pretty funny story on the stairs at Caroline's last night after the  Brian Regan show.  Yeah.  Because after penning, you know, FBA, he has a life.  He's a comic.  And, you know, you had to do Caroline's the night you wrote FBA.  And what happened that night?  It was first show Friday.  And, you know, please welcome Mike DiNicola.  About 60 people.  Oh, and A.  Full Blown Aids.  Yeah.  The club doesn't know.  They don't know.  People are giving condolences.  They go up to the bartender. 
[01:37:30]  The bartender's like, you want a beer?  Yeah.  And I go, what's with the Full Blown Aids thing?  Oh, full Blown Aids.  Oh, you heard that?  Sorry about that.  Walking through the crowd.  Full Blown Aids thing.  You go up to the, uh, where they have the people wait before they seat you.  Yeah.  Like the crowd would park with the red suit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd walk through.  They'd be like, hey, great job on ONA, man.  You're having nice.  Full Blown Aids.  You rock.  I'm like, thank you.  I think.  Full Blown Aids.  But after we left, after Jay, uh, Lynch and I left the studio, we're, oh, we just felt 
[01:38:00]  dirty.  Yeah, yeah.  We were taking, like, we shared a cab.  We couldn't look at each other.  Uh-huh.  I went home.  I called my grandmother.  Grandma, how you doing?  Yeah.  Why are you calling?  Well, Stephen's disavowed any knowledge of the song whatsoever.  We'll not allow it to be aired, uh, with him singing under any circumstance.  That's so wrong, because the more you fight it, the more it sticks you.  Right.  I'm being, we're being called radio teasers.  No, we will play She Smells Straight.  We just had an intro, Mike DiNicola, that just showed up.  See, this stuff happened.  We did it again.  And we're not going to take another commercial break before we play She Smells Us. 
[01:38:30]  Are you promising that?  I have to promise that.  Well, I mean, this is the guy that started.  He also promised he was going to give me my 600 bucks.  All right, I got the hint.  Been riding me real hard this week.  Yeah.  See, he loses a few bucks in the market, and now he wants his money back.  Yeah, look at that.  He's only got three teams left in the pool.  When he was kicking ass last week in the stock market, he forgot all about the money I owed.  But he took some hits the last few days. 
[01:39:00]  Next thing you know, he's looking for a couple of days.  Been rough.  Yeah, NASDAQ.  All right.  Yeah, NASDAQ.  A little tricky the past couple of days.  A little tricky to play.  A little.  But, yeah, Mike DiNicola, who started this whole contest.  He didn't know he was starting the most offensive song contest.  Like a proud parent.  So, send all letters to Mike DiNicola.  Yeah, these are pretty bad.  So, at first, you didn't even want to take credit for the FBA show.  Absolutely.  You were just like, oh, my God, I hope people forget about this. 
[01:39:30]  Absolutely.  It was, we went, like, literally, I called my grandmother.  We were trying to help an old lady across the street, just trying to rack up some good karma.  Yeah, that ain't going to happen.  I know, I know.  But then everybody I ran into was like, that was great.  I'm like, yeah, it was great.  Yeah, accept it.  You know what it's like?  It's like Mr. Spock, Leonard Nimoy.  Remember, for years, he would resist it.  Yeah.  He played Spock.  He put out a book, I Am Not Spock.  He wanted to pursue poetry and acting and other things. 
[01:40:00]  Then, finally, he said, you know something?  F it.  I'm Spock.  I was Spock.  I'm very proud of Mr. Spock and the work.  Over the years, look how long this character has endured.  And now he's at peace with it.  Absolutely.  Mike Nicola has embraced the full-blown AIDS.  Full-blown AIDS.  He has embraced full-blown AIDS.  Absolutely.  Isn't that great?  Hello, Fresco.  Wonderful.  So we've got to get you a bang, because I think you need to record your own version of that song. 
[01:40:30]  Someone's going to have to do it.  You know who's got to do it?  We deliver Kegger's Chick.  Oh, Nicky.  Maybe Nicky can perform full-blown AIDS in place of Stephen Lynch, because Stephen Lynch  will never play that song live.  Never, ever, ever.  But that's the worst, especially to say to ONA listeners, because every show he does from  now on, they're just going to be chanting FBA.  It's like saying, I'm daring you to...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's why you have to take credit for the song immediately.  I will.  It's done. 
[01:41:00]  Well, should we play the FBA before we play the She Smells Strange song, Anthony?  It's right here.  Oh, my God.  We're never getting to it.  No, we are.  I swear.  It's not even...  You know.  Okay.  FBA first.  This is the song that started the Most Offensive Song Contest.  Even though Stephen is singing this song, he has nothing to do with this.  He was forced at gunpoint, I mean...  Yes, we were holding pistols to his head.  Yeah.  And the whole setup, it took us 20 minutes to convince him just to sing it for Mike DiNicola,  because Mike's not a singer, Anthony.  Right.  With that said, here's Mike DiNicola. 
[01:41:30]  Sounds like Stephen Lynch, but it's Mike DiNicola.  Right.  And his song, Full Blown Age, the song that started the Most Offensive Song Contest.  All right.  This is called...  What is this called again?  Authors of the song?  Jay?  Jay, what's this called?  It's called Full Blown Age.  Down to my target weight.  Down to my target weight.  A coma has popped up all over my face.  I lost three teeth and all my friends. 
[01:42:00]  Looks like I'm nearing the end.  No use telling a lie or even a fib when you're lying in bed counting all your ribs.  You try to give blood, but you showed me the door.  I'm not going to stand up when I fell on the floor.  It's full-blowing.  Damn that whore. 
[01:42:30]  Damn that whore.  I said, damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  All right, that was Jay and Mike.  Steven, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Jay and Mike.  I can't believe you would play a song like that.  That is probably the most offensive thing I've ever heard in my life.  Jay and Mike.  Just reading what they wrote in front of me.  Yeah, and everybody knows who wrote Living La Vida Loca.  Now, it's got to be said, though, because he really doesn't want to be associated with that. 
[01:43:00]  It's Mike Dina-Cole.  It's Mike Dina-Cole.  I'm serious.  It's Adolf Hitler.  That's who wrote it.  Adolf Hitler.  Lynch is a real good friend of the show, and it'll really piss him off.  Killing kittens is fine.  And then he won't come around anymore.  We don't want that to happen.  All right, with that in, let's get to, finally, the latest entry in the most offensive song contest.  Oh, look at the time.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:43:30]  Mike, did you hear the one we played earlier?  I did.  Done to the Candyman?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  That was...  Now, is that worse than Baby Raper?  I haven't heard Baby Raper.  Oh, you want us to play that now?  We'll play that in a little while.  But, okay, let's get into it.  It's Daz.  Sounds like an old-school rap song.  Does it?  If someone could help me out with what it sounds like.  Like an old-school crap song.  I like this one.  He's got a wacky little style.  Yeah, he does. 
[01:44:00]  And, well, the song is called She Smells Strange, Anthony.  The latest entry in the most offensive song contest.  Right?  Daz, everyone.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I think there's a long intro here.  Yeah.  So far, I'm offended.  It sounds like Dr. Drett.  All right, here it is.  She smells strange. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  I like the way she walked.  I like the way she talked.  And her booty was delicious.  So we hopped in the bay.  And she grabbed my hay.  And she shoved it down like vicious.  As I went to work, my head started to jerk.  On her carpet, I did munch.  As I spread her legs, they smelled like rotten eggs.  And I almost lost my lunch because she smelled strange.  And I liked it.  She smelled strange down between her legs. 
[01:45:00]  Okay, terrific.  Smelled strange when she spread those gams apart.  Smelled strange like a box of rotten eggs.  She's got the smell everybody knows.  Like Fritos, corn chips, and sweaty toes.  She don't douche after her monthly flows.  So I buried my nose where her fungus grows. 
[01:45:30]  And I liked it.  Yes, I liked it.  I liked it.  They should smell down there.  I liked it.  Yes, I liked it.  Hey, J.P. Morgan's going for the gams.  I liked it.  Oh, my God.  I'm just offended at the rap stylings.  I like it.  Come on, A.  Give it a chance. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  One more width of it.  I...  I...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I...  Take my breath away.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's what I do.  Oh.  Oh, that's great.

[01:55:00]  like that song it's like so lame she smells strange yeah i just thought it was stupid to get started i  know it started off good though when he started singing and then it didn't go anywhere right but  it's it's one of the better entries we've gotten lately we're only playing the ones that we think are  worth playing on the radio so right but i want to know after this contest is over  why don't you take the 10 best songs and put out a cd wow that's a great idea i mean you can keep  all the royalties because no one's going to take credit for the song you should no one want to take  the money and how the hell are we going to buy it uh sell it who the hell's going to you know put it 
[01:55:30]  in their record store that's not a bad idea though maybe we could burn some cds and sell them on the  internet or something anthony out of uh duffel bags out on 57 yeah we'll be before the show we'll have  duffel bags filled with the cds and yeah and we'll sell them now i like the idea eric we'll  look into it also i i heard all the songs except the barry manilow one well the barry manilow i think  uh everyone's in agreement just didn't make it i mean it was a good song early on in the you know 
[01:56:00]  the competition it got things rolling right so don't worry about it i i don't think that one's  gonna uh win it and also steven lynch you're relaxed because compared to some of the stuff  you've played lately football age is like a christmas carol now yeah i know now that's not  that bad the bar has been uh moved uh up now eric you've heard all the songs which one do you think  is the most offensive thus far uh well wow i guess it would have to be the baby raper yeah i'm still  going with baby raper myself although i don't know i was laughing my ass off at the last one i was like 
[01:56:30]  oh my god and sammy davis jr's dad oh the candy man sorry yeah the kkk man yeah and then they even  added the aids thing in there yeah i know i was like well they covered two bases there no dad oh and  he was jewish sammy davis jr so they really got three in there yeah yeah all right man all right  thanks a lot peace bye bye there goes eric let's go to joey loads joey hey what's going on how are  you good each listen you got to get the uh on the jerky boys thing the musacha tapes you know about 
[01:57:00]  that i've heard of them after the first jerky boys no this was pre this was before this is the old  one it was on the same record label as the two bar the red tapes yeah i heard some of the stuff i  wasn't too impressed oh excellent contest is really really cool all right man all right man  thank you peace out a lot of people asking us to play the uh the kkk man song again yeah by joe and  bob but why don't we get to uh the last entry for today that's what i want to hear uh we do have 
[01:57:30]  another five or six songs that we still have to listen to and they're coming in every day but  there's six more songs that we could have possibly put on the radio we just we have to pre-screen them  and get all the verses out and all that stuff make it legal yeah as far as the radio goes make sure  they're up to snuff and uh you still have a couple weeks to get your your song in and then uh we'll  get a winner soon we're thinking uh you know the finalists have to perform the song live at a road  show but yeah some of these entries i don't know if the people have the balls to do it live in front 
[01:58:00]  of 1400 people we'll have security up on stage what did they win we don't know what they win yet yeah  it's one of those contests without a prize maybe they win a whole race of people hating you  maybe we could uh put up uh like chicken wire yeah like in the blues brothers and then they can  perform the songs behind the chicken wire i like that it's a good idea all right uh here's the last  uh entry for today it's by fuel aka jeff or jeff aka fuel right he uh he pens such ditties as uh how 
[01:58:30]  much is that darky in the window yeah and uh baby raper it's like a regular k-tel yeah well in his  third entry in in the in the most offensive song contest is a song called camp camp concentration i  wonder what this is about hmm hmm oh man camp concentration yes all right well like i said  before the songs have to be offensive it's the offended offensive song contest come on i haven't 
[01:59:00]  heard this one yet i'm hearing it for the first time on the air uh rick heard it before the show  and and you like it rick you think it's you think it's in the running for the most offensive song  i think it deserves to uh be heard and let the listeners decide you know all right all right here  we go you ready all right i'm ready here's fuel camp concentration  welcome to camp concentration

[02:04:00]  yeah  oh  yeah we picked a great day to you know walk to the la bar now  what are we nuts  oh man i got like tears of snot all over my paperwork for laughing so damn hard  oh jesus  alright paul  alright man  thank you  bye  let's go to steve steve you're next on any w  yeah what's up guys  how are you  yeah it sounds like a rip off from  caught me singing my car's a big fat bitch his mom 
[02:04:30]  yeah it definitely that's why i said it sounds uh... south parkish  yeah  well i mean it'll be up to you guys to decide  it's not a south parkish but i don't think it sounds like that  yeah  kyle's mom's big fat bitch  yeah it's got the little melody line to it  big as bitch in all my man  what counts a king king king king king king king king  close enough  thank you steve  alright out the vagina  Yeah, Daddy G.  Pips in the kitchen. 
[02:05:00]  All right, let's go to Tom.  Hey, Tom, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  You guys are freaking brutal.  Well, it is the most offensive song.  Hell, yeah.  My God, I cannot believe I'm listening to this stuff.  It's crazy.  All right, now, is that more offensive than the KKK song?  Yeah, I believe.  I believe.  Do we need to play the KKK song?  I don't think it's as offensive as the KKK song,  and a lot of feedback that I'm reading now is saying that funny, catchy tune,  but not as offensive.  Hey, Ann.  Well, these listeners, they're tough with their bonding. 
[02:05:30]  I know, they are.  Ann, take me out Columbine style.  No.  Come on.  Come on.  Later, guys.  Thanks, Tom.  Take me out crappy ratings style.  Our first Jewish lady checking in, Leslie.  Leslie?  Yeah?  Turn down your radio.  You're live on the air.  Okay, hey, I really did not find that all that offensive at all.  I thought it was, I don't know, somewhat entertaining.  I don't know why.  I really was disgustingly repulsed by the Baby Raper song the other day,  and that one really kind of got to my gut way more than this one did. 
[02:06:00]  It's a problem with the Baby Raper song.  All right, so you're voting for Baby Raper at this point, huh?  Yeah, definitely am.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  No problem.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Darren.  Darren, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I'm Jewish, and I was in the car with my dad.  Yeah.  The song came on.  Uh-oh.  I look, okay, he had, like, relatives who died in the Holocaust.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's something to joke about, obviously.  I know.  I looked at his face, and I swear to God, I thought he was going to kill me. 
[02:06:30]  He's like, how can you listen to this?  The opiancy, I don't want you to listen.  Oh, my God.  He was, oh, man.  It's not your fault.  Well, yeah, it's just songs being sent in because they're offensive.  That's why they're being played.  Yeah, I wanted to laugh, but, oh, my God, I would have gotten smacked.  You can't have a most offensive song contest and candy coat it, but.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't get to hear the whole song because I had to turn it off.  I was like, Dad, I'm going to turn this off now, okay?  Yeah.  That uncomfortable moment when you're both listening to radio, and you're like, uh, all right,  I'll make the move. 
[02:07:00]  Listen, let's see what Z100 is doing.  Yeah, yeah.  What the hell?  Could this be real?  Well, it says, uh, you guys have completely crossed the line.  I'm totally offended, and it's signed Adolf Hitler.  All right, Darren, thank you.  All right, you guys are gods.  All right, bye.  Uh, let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Uh, uh, I think you should give, uh, Fuel a gold record.  Get all of his, uh, accumulation albums there, and, uh, the guy is fantastic.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  But I would have to vote for Baby Raper. 
[02:07:30]  Well, which was by Fuel as well.  He's got three entries in the contest already.  Some people just trying to get one entry in.  He's got three already, yeah.  He's fantastic.  All right, thank you, John.  I'm waiting for Fuel to give us a call.  He usually calls us after we play one of his entries, Anthony.  You get the feeling.  I believe he's hiding in his attic like Anne Frank right now.  I don't know.  You get the feeling that Fuel has waited his whole life for an opportunity such as this.  Yeah, you know?  Finally, someplace to find songs. 
[02:08:00]  He didn't even have to write them.  We just pulled them out of a shoebox.  My baby.  Finally.  We'll finally breathe.  My children will see the light of day.  James, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, hi, guys.  Hi.  I was the one who called in early in the week.  Yeah.  A bunch.  Well, I'm Jewish and stuff, and I got to tell you, I'm probably the least observant Jew.  Yeah.  All these guys say it's not offensive.  Yeah.  Man, they can't be part of the Holocaust.  They've got to be, like, Catholic or something.  Yeah, that was pretty offensive.  I mean, I still say Baby Raper is still in the lead.  Okay.  And I'm Jewish and stuff, but, I mean, that was very, very bad. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  A couple of other things.  Anthony, you need to get, like, a cashier noise effect because you're going to be O&O,  be a lot of money after the NCAA is over.  Yeah.  Yeah, UConn just won, by the way.  Yeah, cha-ching.  Cha-ching.  I got four teams still in the running for the final four, and it's down to three already.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Take care from now, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Eric, another Jewish guy checking in.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  I am driving, and I almost crashed right off the road when I just heard that song. 
[02:09:00]  You're Jewish, too?  I'm Jewish.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I'm always up for a good joke.  Yeah.  When they started talking about my mom never coming back from the shower, I was very  ouch.  Yeah, that line was brutal.  Yeah, that was good, though.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I mean, it could have been a little better, but...  All right.  Well, thank you, Eric.  All right.  No problem.  All right, man.  Anything like that on the air or anything like that?  You're on the air.  Now we're hanging up on you.  You'll hear the end of the conversation when you hang up.  All right.  Another Eric on the line.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  What's up? 
[02:09:30]  I absolutely love the song.  It reminded me of the, like, happy ending to a Roberto Benigni movie.  It was, like, the crescendo of the crickets at the end of, like, the very climax at the  end of the film.  Yeah.  That was added by Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, good work, Anthony.  Bravo.  Thank you.  I know Fuel doesn't mind if I add little sounds to a song.  Like the baby crying during the Baby Raper song really seemed to have hit a nerve.  You're helping out. 
[02:10:00]  I'm helping out.  You're helping Fuel's cause.  I'm like a producer.  It's like 100 songs.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Eric.  Well, thank you guys for enlightening me.  All right.  Well, everyone requesting the KKK man song.  Oh, my God.  One more time?  One more time.  Well, we are running the World Most Offensive Song Contest.  So what the hell?  And this one we played earlier, and I begged.  I begged and pleaded.  I didn't want to play this today.  We did get a bunch of our black listeners to give us the okay to play it. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  And this is...  Brutal.  This is brutal.  It's just brutal.  KKK man.  All right.  Let's play this, Anthony.  One more time.  The KKK man.  All right, everybody.  Gather out.

[02:14:00]  in the universe ever oh my god anthony oh my god what's up what's the new station letters that  we're gonna be on why you're going on vacation right yeah don't come back all right we ain't  gonna have a show ah oh we're not it's the world's most offensive song contest oh yeah they're gonna 
[02:14:30]  be offensive it's all gold it's the whole contest we're not gonna have a job have a safe trip  all right well we'll see you when we get back anthony happy saint patty's day all right man  bye bro you're gonna get mad at a guy running a race that wins because he ran so fast that's what  it is you're getting mad at these people writing offensive songs it's an offensive song contest  larry what's going on anthony anthony yes you suck why what did i do i haven't blown  liquid out of my nose since i was 10 years old i didn't write those you did that little south park 
[02:15:00]  in the kitchen after the after the other one and i just i was in the middle of swallowing and driving  at the same time and it went everywhere  you guys are great and speaking of uh camp concentration yeah another celebrity calling 
[02:15:30]  the radio show who who it's fuel fuel all right get fuel on the line the writer of camp concentration  here he is look at a standing ovation for fuel how does it you are like the new  lennon and mccartney like anthony said earlier you're the elton john of most offensive songs  yeah is it too late to play the hey i'm a fairly normal guy card no yeah much too late it's over  no forget about that hey i'm a fairly normal guy card you gotta be kidding me i'm impressed because 
[02:16:00]  we've gotten close to a hundred uh entries in this contest and we're not playing all of them  on the air because you know most of them just flat out suck or you can't hear it or whatever  uh fuel has has gotten three of his songs on the radio so far he's a protege a protege  it's amazing it's not like they were sitting around either i brought them just for you  well i'd also like to volunteer if uh if steven lynch doesn't want to be associated with fba i have  no problem really no problem well we need mike de nicola singing it because it's his song 
[02:16:30]  that's cool can you play the music for him or something yeah all right sure is that you singing  on uh camp concentration yes man you got a good one you got quite a range with your your vocal  styling that that's as high as i go yeah very impressive now fuel the question i gotta ask  do you have any other songs in you um yeah unfortunately i do yeah uh i don't are you holding  back and waiting to see how this uh contest develops no i i think uh the baby raper and camp 
[02:17:00]  concentration we're definitely up there yeah but uh you know today is young i don't know man the kkk  man is uh is uh is is giving you a run for your money man that is a pretty damn offensive song  that is you gotta admit it is offensive isn't it absolutely if the contest ended today i'd have to  go like ann said though we have to listen to baby raper again you know you know why i'm going toward  the kkk guy because in the sickest kind of way fuel songs almost you could tell he's kind of having 
[02:17:30]  fun with the concept you know even though they're really offensive baby raper my god offensive song  you could still tell he's kind of having fun with it that kkk one is nothing but hatred there's nothing  but hatred being pumped out of that song yeah so that's why i think it might win his most offensive  all right it's almost annoying though not that i don't want to rip somebody else's head 
[02:18:00]  stand up fuel i don't want to start you know the most offensive song artist having a little cat fight  absolutely i don't want to start a fight but you know about two minutes in you're like yeah  the kids in the background now  if anything i've learned it's like two minutes tops gotta get out  ah he knows parodies very good yeah that's the key to this contest you gotta get to the point fast and  quick you don't like these long songs two minutes tops is good enough you know it's gone too far when 
[02:18:30]  uh writers of the songs are looking down their noses at other songs yeah it's a little trance you  know i know he did go very long he's a little hack fuel this is what we're gonna do hold on the line  too easy we got we got to take a break we will play baby raper next and then we'll go to the  phones to see who truly is in the lead all right of the most offensive song contest okay hold on  we'll do that next all right it's your genius and we got to get out of here in about 15 minutes  to go to la barbat 57th street between 8th and 9th we're doing the last hour of the show

[02:25:30]  When mommy turns away, I go for more.  Sing their songs and tell them that they're sweet.  As I slip the little booties off their feet.  Baby Rayburn, I'm a baby Rayburn. 
[02:26:00]  And young, they're good enough to eat.  Baby Rayburn, I'm a baby Rayburn.  The youngest cherries I always say so sweet.  Baby Rayburn, I'm a baby Rayburn. 
[02:26:30]  Sweet and young, they're good enough to eat.  Baby Rayburn.  All right, there you have it, Anthony.  Baby Rayburn.  Our personal security, they have left the building.  I don't think they want to walk us down a little barbed anymore.  Holy smoke.  No, I got to tell these guys, look, we didn't write that.  I mean, we put it out there, like I said, most offensive song contest. 
[02:27:00]  And we've gotten some songs that are just completely, I'm totally offended by that one.  Every time we play one, I think that's got to be the one that wins.  Now, I'm looking back thinking, this has got to be the most offensive song I've ever heard.  Now that I've heard them all today, yeah, I think that one's still in the lead, man.  Oh, my God.  Baby Rayburn.  Baby Rayburn, yeah.  Look at these guys.  Yes.  That's incredible.  I'm pretty sick.  That could be the most offensive song ever.  All right. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, we'll see you guys downstairs, then.  We've got to just wrap up the festivities here.  And then we're out.  And then we're out.  Like what?  See you downstairs.  Five minutes?  Ten minutes?  Five more minutes, and then we'll do the last hour of the show from La Barbat, 57th Street,  between 8th and 9th.  We're going to stay a couple hours at least.  See you later.  Wow.  And if you're in the area, please, please join us.  Good God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:00]  I did.  I can breathe.  Anyway.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Did you see the size of that guy?  Both of them.  Could be the biggest guy I've ever seen in my life.  This guy is huge.  We've got to invite him down to the appearance when Fuel plays a couple of his songs.  Oh, yeah.  And when the other guy plays.  What was his nickname?  Jurassic Park?  Wow.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Uh, Fuel.  Yes?  What's up?  Nothing. 
[02:28:30]  Are they next to the elevator, Rick?  Uh, they are now outside of your shot.  All right.  Good.  Oh, my God.  I thought for a second they had heard the KKK song.  Oh, my dear, sweet.  When I saw them walking down the hall when they first arrived, I'm like, we are so dead.  We are so freaking dead.  Fuel.  You're going to get us killed, you ass.  How about that?  Fuel, the writer of the KKK.  Not the KKK.  No, Baby Raper.  Baby Raper and Camp Concentration.  Yeah.  My mother, by the way, thought the Baby Raper song was absolutely hysterical and asked me 
[02:29:00]  for a tape.  Oh, really?  Get out of here.  Shocking.  That's cute.  The one who spawned you.  I know.  Yeah, she had you, so I mean, there's some of that in her, too, you know?  I had to test the mother's pride versus her moral code.  Hold on.  The guy that wrote the KKK song checking in.  Bob.  Oh, no.  Bob from Joe and Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  There he is.  Wow.  Hello?  You're getting a huge ovation.  Bob, you're on the line with Fuel, a.k.a. Jeff. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  How you doing, man?  Hey, Bob.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, good luck to you.  Nice song.  Beautiful thing.  But, you know, I take offense, mean-spirited.  You wanted bad.  You got bad.  Well, no, I didn't say it was a bad thing that it was so mean-spirited.  I said that's why you're in the lead.  All right.  In my book, that's why I think your song is more offensive because, I mean, it's complete hatred.  But that's what I mean.  It's not hatred.  You want it the most offensive.  And that's the funniest thing in the world.  You can't get hatred out of funny.  Yeah.  Of course.  If Chris Rock wrote that song, it would be top 40. 
[02:30:00]  Well, you got a point there, Bob.  I think you got another verse.  Bob, you're giving Fuel a run for his money.  That is for sure.  Hey, Bob, you should see our security guys.  Yeah, well, I hope they're big if I got to come down there.  Ah, they're big, but they'll kill you.  They will kill you.  I mean, the security you're going to get from me when I got to play this song.  Yeah, we'll get these two guys.  We're going to get the chicken wire so you guys can play these songs live at the next road show.  All right.  Roll them out.  Ride.  All right.  Guys, hold on.  We might have to come back to you. 
[02:30:30]  Hold on.  Okay.  There they go.  Bob from Joe and Bob, the KKK man songwriter, and, of course, Camp Concentration, Fuel's latest effort, and the writer of Baby Raper as well.  Well, let's go to the...  What were you there?  I got to tell you, just before we came back and you brought the security guys on, I walked over to pick up the phone to call somebody about the show.  I see these guys standing there.  I see these guys in suits.  I'm looking at them going, who the hell let them down here because they don't look happy. 
[02:31:00]  No, I know.  And I was just like...  That's why I asked them.  That's why I had to ask on the air, have you guys been hearing the songs we've been playing?  And when they said no, I went...  I thought Farrakhan...  There is a God.  Huh?  I thought Farrakhan sent them over.  Yeah.  I was...  All right.  That's in a brick.  All right.  Let's go to the phone and see what everyone's saying now that they've heard all three back to back to back there.  Al, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi, Al.  The worst one is Baby Raper.  You're going to vote for Baby Raper?  I think Camp Concentration reminds me of the movie The Producer with Springtime for Hitler in Germany. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, the contest isn't over.  I mean, we have another at least five or six songs in the back office we haven't even been able to listen to yet.  But none of them...  And the contest is 10 or 12 coming in a day at this point.  None of them really offended me.  I think they're too funny to be offended.  All right, Al.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Some people checking in saying Camp Concentration sounds just like Shut Your F'n Face, Uncle Effer. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, that's what it sounds like.  Yeah.  Welcome to Camp Concentration.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Listen.  I'll tell you.  I have...  You shouldn't be giving away duffel bags of CDs.  You should be giving away duffel bags of paper towel and tissue.  I swear to God.  My entire...  Everybody who was over here, we were all working on the computer listening to your show, and  there was all kinds of stuff flying all over the room the minute you started playing KKK Man 
[02:32:30]  and KKK Man and Camp Concentration back-to-back.  Yeah.  And I absolutely have to say that at this moment, I can't pick.  It's going to be between KKK Man and Camp Concentration.  Okay.  Very good.  Absolutely hilarious.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right, man.  Look at that.  We did a most offensive song, Twofer, Anthony.  Yeah, Twofer.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up?  Yeah, KKK guy.  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  Best song I've ever heard in my entire life.  Most Offensive so far?  I don't know Offensive.  It's just the greatest song ever.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Tom, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Good.  I must say Fuel is the man, but I think KKK, that song is leading, man.  All right.  Okay.  I don't know what the hell that guy was planning on doing with the cat a few months back,  but if that didn't make the air, and these songs are, I don't even want to know.  Well, you know, it's a most offensive song contest, though.  After hearing the Baby Raper song.  You guys got to watch it.  Haven't you ever seen Talk Radio? 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  Excuse me, Mr. Champlain.  Can I have to?  All right.  All right.  That's every DJ's nightmare.  Cut it out.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  No, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Good.  Let me know first off.  How much is that darky in the window?  Yeah.  I was at work today singing it.  Yeah.  I kind of offended some Blackford people.  Oh, really?  You were singing that?  Yeah.  And also, I don't know which one to pick.  KKK or Cam Concentration.  It's how we had to go, Cam Concentration. 
[02:34:00]  All right, man.  It sounds a lot like, you know, a shirt on coke, you know?  All right.  Well, thank you, bro.  Thank you, guys.  You guys rock, man.  All right.  Let's go to Manny, a friend of the show.  Manny, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey, you're going to be at La Barbet?  Nah, man.  Oh, you didn't make it, huh?  Yeah, I wanted to, fellas.  My daughter was a little under the weather.  Well, we'll get you at the next road show, all right?  Yeah, yeah.  How y'all doing today?  Well, we've had some very controversial songs on the radio today, man.  Yeah, I wanted to talk to you all about that.  All right.  Hey, yo, who made that KKK joint? 
[02:34:30]  Bob.  Bob.  Joey and Bob, yeah.  Bob, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, me and I'm in the Bronx.  Me and some of my friends want to come to the studio and congratulate them.  How hot that song is.  Get a real hot song there, Bob.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  You'd like to come down and just, like, give them a pat on the back or something?  Yeah, I want to give them a pat on the back.  All right, that's awfully nice of you, Manny.  Yeah.  Nice gesture.  Yeah, I want to do some things with Bob and let them know how hot that song is.  Me and my friends feel the same way about Bob.  Yeah, I bet. 
[02:35:00]  Hot song.  Now, Manny, you've heard all the songs, I'm assuming.  Which one is the most offensive song to this point?  It's because of the context, in my opinion, fellas.  Yeah.  And, you know, y'all know how I get down.  Y'all are real cats to me.  Yeah.  I have to say KKK because of the context of the way it's used.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, there's, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  The baby joint.  I got kids and I laughed at that.  You know what I mean?  Come on, that didn't hit that nerve.  And plus, we got this racial tension going on in New York right now.  Come on, that hit a nerve on everybody. 
[02:35:30]  I think white people was like, damn, I don't want to be called nigger.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, well, I asked permission before I played the song.  Yeah, I heard you had a whole lot of, let's see, black, Earl-type black people calling up, giving that permission.  Yeah.  Believe me, I was riffing with my boss.  I'm like, look, money, I need to call in right now.  He, you know, threatened some jobs type.  Yeah.  So I was like, all right, I'll let it ride.  But I wouldn't have gave no type permission.  All right, man. 
[02:36:00]  Well, it is offensive.  Manny, I got to cut you off real fast because we got to get out of here.  Yeah, no doubt.  Hey, y'all cats have fun, man.  Give me an um.  You hear my daughter?  Yeah.  Hey, yo, drink a bud for me, man.  All right, man.  Hey, yo, the show has been off to me, the fella.  Yeah, we're trying.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why we need to take a break.  We got to recharge so we can keep it going.  Hey, pop it to me now, baby.  All right, Manny.  Peace.  Good friend of the show, Manny.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry, real fast because we got to head down to La Barbat, 57th Street, between 8th and 9th.  What's up?  Yeah, you guys alienated me at work. 
[02:36:30]  I work in Flatbush, Brooklyn.  Okay, at a YMCA with children.  Yeah.  Black people and children.  Well, you're listening to our show.  I was listening to the show and you guys totally and completely alienated me.  I think I'm going to be gone after today.  All right.  Thank you.  Peace.  Yeah, man.  Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, real fast.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How's it going?  Good.  Everybody keeps forgetting about Kilo Fetus from ASIC.  I thought that was pretty offensive myself when I first heard it.  Well, what we're going to do, you know, down the road, we're going to get the top five. 
[02:37:00]  We're going to put them on the radio and get, you know, everyone will have a fair chance  when it comes down to the end there.  Well, how long is this contest going to last?  Well, we're going away for a week.  Dude, you don't understand how many songs are coming in at this point.  They're finally piling in like you wouldn't believe.  And we're going to send the winning song to the Guinness Book of World Records, try to get it in the book.  As the most offensive song.  Ever played on the radio.  That's pretty good.  All right, guys, take it in the rear.  All right, Vinny.  That guy.  It's the take it in the rear guy. 
[02:37:30]  I love when he gets through.  It's like a celebrity.  Hey, it's the take it in the rear guy.  Everyone's got a little notoriety on this show.  Of course.  Well, we've got to leave.  We've got to go to La Barbat.  Oh, really?  I didn't know we were leaving.  Look at you.  It's all packed.  Well, let's say goodbye to Fuel.  Hey, Fuel.  Hey.  I'm sure we'll talk to you after the vacation there, right?  I'll spend the week, see what I can come up with for you.  Oh, gee, fast.  Can't wait.  Some more entries.  Well, there's at least one that's written that we haven't recorded yet. 
[02:38:00]  My brother wrote some of it, so.  Want to tease us with a title?  No, no, no.  I don't even want to know.  I don't even want to know.  I want to be pleasant and pleasantly.  Pleasantly surprised.  Pleasantly.  All right.  Well, I'll pick some new group and, you know, more people to offend.  All right, man.  Congratulations, Fuel.  Thanks.  And let's go to Bob real fast.  Bob.  Hey.  Thanks for the entry today.  Okay, no problem.  You're the talk of the city today.  I hope you'll keep them coming, but I'm standing on my one shot there.  All right.  All right, take it easy.  All right, bye.  Fuel making it up in quantity.  All right, man.  Let's head out.  We'll see you guys at Le Barbat for a few beers in the last hour of the show there. 
[02:38:30]  Right.  All right.  You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now.  The OBS Anthony Show.  Thank you.  1027 WNEW.  I just want justice for the rebellion.  It's a big sploge thing.  Turn that crap off.  A butt plug.  Turn that crap off. 
[02:39:00]  I'm not doing the chicken dance.  A butt plug.  I hate you.  Butt plug.  I hate you.  And my ball sack's bouncing around like a hippity hop.  Scrutum.  Who?  Scrutum.  Okay.  They were connected to toys.  It's all bad.  Put a little toys.  Scrutum.  What's your name?  Scrutum.  Hardware.  Okay.  What do you need in the hardware?  I got your pleasure menu.  Can you hold on a minute? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, mommy.  Me, you, your mama, a couple of friends.  My Rottweiler?  The power tool?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  This is a gusher.  Damn you all to hell.  Damn you all to hell.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  I have been vindicated.  It's all right.  It's, uh, it's over here, Anthony. 
[02:40:00]  Where is Anthony?  Oh, Anthony's taking pictures.  We are outside, uh, the building on, uh, 57th Street.  Get that camera out of my face, Psycho Mark.  Anthony, I got a phone that's working.  We are walking down to LaBarbat.  There are so many people out here on the sidewalk with us.  Uh, the FBA guy is, like, walking in front of us with the FBA sign.  People are walking by.  They're absolutely horrified.  Hey, is your phone working?  It's ringing?  Here, say hi on this one before, uh, while you get through. 
[02:40:30]  There we go.  I think I'm on.  All right.  We're going to be at LaBarbat in about a block,  a block and a half.  People are, like, poking their heads out of their establishments,  going, what the hell is going on?  As we make our pilgrimage down to, uh, LaBarbat.  That's wonderful.  They're just scaring the crap out of people.  I feel like I'm part of an AIDS walk.  FDA!  FDA!  I feel like I'm part of an AIDS walk. 
[02:41:00]  FDA!  FDA!  FDA!  Yes, the FDA, a very important organization.  What the hell is that?  Get you guys out of your mind, FDA.  Half the people walking by and have no freaking idea what's going on, Anthony.  Like, who are these wackos?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, my God.  Hey, let's make this light.  Make this light.  The guys are huge.  All right, we're on 57th and Broadway, I do believe.  Yes.  We've got another block and a half to go.  This is the most exercise I've gotten in years. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, Rick, you want to, uh, take a break and then we'll talk after commercials or what?  Where are we?  Uh, no, we don't have time for a break, actually.  We don't have time for a break.  You guys actually got to keep talking.  Huh?  Just keep talking.  He says we got to keep talking, I'll be.  Yeah, stretch it out.  I'm walking, I'm getting a little winded.  These sidewalks are good for walking on.  I never realized that.  Usually I'm driving on them.  My wind is so obnoxious with that siren. 
[02:42:00]  You see them?  People are taking pictures.  They're jumping.  I don't even know if we're still on the radio.  Who cares, though?  We're on vacation starting tomorrow, right, Ant?  All right, yeah, where are we?  We're on, uh, 57th and, uh, 8th, I believe. 
[02:42:30]  We're a half a block away from, from La Barbat.  People, like, getting off the, the bus looking at us like, who the hell are these guys?  I just ran into a friend of mine, man.  He just got off the bus.  All right, are we crossing?  Let's go this way.  What's up, bro?  What's up, bro?  Hey, give your band a plug.  Saccharin, number one.  All right, there we go, Saccharin.  Actually, a good band.  I filmed in the village about a month ago.  Hey, where are you? 
[02:43:00]  Hang up.  Oh.  Oh, oh.  I had, I had to disconnect, Ant.  We're getting major feedback.  Have them hang up and call back.  All right, where are we right now?  Am I still on the, am I still on the radio?  Yeah, you're on the air.  You're fine.  It's Anthony's phone.  It's coming back.  All right, Ant, you're going to call back.  All right, we're a half a block from La Barbat, Anthony.  The crowd is building and building and building.  All right, Rick, you want to take a break, or you want to make sure we get into the place  first?  Let's make sure you guys get into the place without any problem.  All right, there's a bunch of people across the street waiting for us. 
[02:43:30]  It's like a two-and-a-half-block pilgrimage.  Ant, you there?  Yeah.  Great.  Are you back on the air?  I think so.  All right.  I'm not hearing that horrible noise anymore.  I'm going to shove that megaphone up Ben's ass in a minute, man.  People are just modified at the OK Terrific signs and the siren.  People have no idea what's going on.  The SBA with the skeleton hanging off of it.  It's an AIDS walk. 
[02:44:00]  It's an AIDS walk.  It's an AIDS walk.  SBA.  To our brothers.  SBA to our brothers.  We've got the SBA guy leading the parade to La Barbat, Anthony.  I hope no one mistakes this for us being maybe gay activists and wanting to get into the parade.  Well, it is St. Paddy's Day, you know.  Yeah.  People don't understand what it is.  Hey, there's a couple left there.  Okay, turn it back. 
[02:44:30]  Hey, Terrific.  Okay, turn it back.  Hey, I think we gave the location a little too early in the show today.  Look at this freaking...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, there's a couple of people out there.  All right.  Look at the people beeping their horns.  Give them an okay, terrific.  They love that.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Seems like we have just a few listeners, Anthony.  A couple. 
[02:45:00]  All right, we are entering La Barbat, Anthony.  And stay close so I can hear what you're saying on the radio.  Very important.  Very important.  Because this is the radio at its best.  Anthony.  Here we go.  Smokey.  What's up, guys?  Here we go.  Yes.  All right, Anthony.  I'm in the front door.  Where's that?  Yeah, I'm right behind you.  Trying to get through.  Ah.  It's a little chilly outside, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're going to make our way to the stage here.  Here we go.  There's got to be tens of hundreds and so on. 
[02:45:30]  Good.  Greeting the fans, Opie.  A lot of people outside.  All right, we're making our way to the stage.  See Opie and Anthony's show the day before vacation.  It's time to drink some green beer with some of our listeners.  All right.  All right.  There's one in here.  We're inside.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You got yourself a job, man. 
[02:46:00]  Here we go.  Look at these people.  Yes.  Thank you.  Opie, wonderful.  Wonderful, Ian.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There's so many freaking people that I can go after here.  I'm on the stage.  I'm looking at them.  I'm trying to get up.  Anthony, what are you there?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  So many people. 
[02:46:30]  We're on the radio.  Really?  Okay.  It's terrific.  I'm trying to get to the spot.  Definitely.  Okay.  It's terrific.  Okay.  It's terrific.  Okay.  It's terrific.  Yeah.  There's just only signs here.  Actually, I.  Lost.  Okay, compassionate.  Okay.  Okay.  Olympic.  Okay. 
[02:47:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Now, we put some here for ourselves.  All right.  We're a little close.  Thank you.  God.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks for going down.  Oh, that was good. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, I think so.  Hey, how about one more time, one more?  That is what you know, Bill.  There you go, all right.  Yeah, we'll go through this.  Shogun! Shogun! Shogun! Shogun! Shogun! Shogun! Shogun!  I'm going to have a punch in the Uriman. 
[02:48:00]  Well, I think we have ourselves a party.  Yeah, yeah.  There seems to be a party atmosphere going on here.  A lot of people, a little to do it.  And a lot of people were into the parade.  And they kind of blew, huh?  With the weather stock in and stuff.  Look at a bunch of guys in their bagpipes.  I heard there were some hot girls doing that river dance crap though. 
[02:48:30]  They're almost cursed up here, and I realize they're having air.  No questions out there.  We have women here, Anthony.  Yeah.  We have women.  I'm noticing that.  Why don't you say hi to the women?  Yeah.  We're noticing that there are actually some women.  I said, this is a French.  We're not really used to this.  Whip!  Oh, God!  Yeah, there's a couple right there.  Wow! 
[02:49:00]  That was a record-breaking crowd.  Big loud sign up in the back.  How you doing?  Oh, my God.  I got some catching up to do.  You mothers seem a little drunk.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Dan?  Yeah, take a break, and we're going to take a smile from the air and really start the  show.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool. 
[02:49:30]  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  We're at about 36-7th street, between, where?  Eighth and Ninth.  Eighth and Ninth.  Yeah.  We're going to be here at least a few hours.  So, okay, in the area, come on by and say hi. 
[02:50:00]  It's the LP ed Anthony show!  So just make a note of it.  Anthony.  You think I would go in the air and make a complete buffoon of myself?  Anthony.  My tampon is sitting a little askew today.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony. 
[02:50:30]  Anthony.  Anthony.  20 girls want to bang me.  20 girls want to bang me.  All right, I think we're on the radio, Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We are live from La Barba with a few of our listeners.  Oh, my God.  Opie, there's been whirlings going on.  People brought their signs and plenty of drinking.  Oh, my God.  Come on!  I think we're the only sober ones here, Anthony. 
[02:51:00]  What's that up?  I think we're the only sober ones here!  Um, speak for yourself, bro.  From the time we were on the list of the unit until now, I'm working on a pretty good bus.  I haven't been talking.  This is why we can't do too many of these things, because everybody wants us to chug.  Chug a kid!  Chug a kid!  Chug a kid!  Chug a kid!  Chug a kid!  I know what he did!  I'm going to get him!  My God!  Hand me my glass.  I'll chug one right over there.  Chug one help. 
[02:51:30]  Chug one help.  I'll chug one.  Cheers!  This place is losing their minds, man.  Chug!  Chug!  Chug!  Chug!  Chug!  Chug!  Chug!  Chug!  Chug!  I do believe we, I do believe we completed that task.  Who's got the smack?  Hey, Anthony, ask the crowd.  Ed and I are working as a team here. 
[02:52:00]  I'm on the radio through the phone, and Ed's talking to the crowd through the megaphone.  And ask the crowd if they've heard the latest entries in the most offensive song contest.  Does anybody keep me keeping tabs on the latest entries in the most offensive song contest?  Yeah, pretty, pretty offensive, huh?  From a sound of applause, maybe, or a noise, what do you think the most offensive song?  Maybe the dead fetus abortion song, no? 
[02:52:30]  KKK song?  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  What about the KKK?  Yeah, what about...  Can't concentrate?  Yeah, can't concentrate.  Good, man.  Good, man.  Good, man.  That's kind of good.  Don't forget Baby Rafer.  Baby Rafer, Anthony.  Baby Rafer.  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't like the next thing I did, doesn't it? 
[02:53:00]  All weekend.  Okay.  They're freaking insane.  This is scary, Anthony.  This is...  This is scary.  I've already drank my complete picture.  There's got to be close to a thousand people here, Anthony.  They can't even hear me.  Rick, I'm on the radio by myself.  And it's like two feet away from me with a megaphone, and we can't even hear each other.  The crowd is just absolutely losing it. 
[02:53:30]  There's got to be close to a thousand people just staring, staring at us.  All right, Rick, are you there?  Yeah, I'm here, dude.  Why don't we take a break, because it's absolutely insane here.  Sounds like it.  You could either...  I don't even care, because we're on vacation.  You could play a couple songs.  You could play an old bit.  You could play some commercials.  Whatever you want to do.  And we'll be back.  I don't even know if we're still on the radio.  It's Opie and Anthony live.  I don't think I'm going to ask, man. 
[02:54:00]  The current thing is all I'm doing.  I hope this is really going to be here.  Because...  I don't think I'm...  I don't think I'm...  I don't think I'm...  I don't think I'm...  I don't think I'm...  I don't think I'm...  I don't think I'm...  All right, we'll be back in a few minutes.  It's Opie and Anthony LeBar back with WNW.  Now let's imagine that you're in the middle of your talk show.  You must identify your station.  You might say...  1027-WNW.  All righty.  If you guys aren't at LeBarbat right now,  which is on 57th Street between 8th and 9th, 
[02:54:30]  then you don't know what's going on.  Or if you're just tuning in,  the guys are there live celebrating the start of their vacation.  The, I guess, St. Patrick's Day.  And they're about to get S-faced.  Okay?  So if you're within the vicinity of 57th Street  between 8th and 9th Avenue,  go down, hang out with Opie and Anthony.  Bunch of stuff to give away.  We got some T-shirts.  The guys just brought a bunch of stuff with them.  Hopefully you guys show up,  have a good time, 
[02:55:00]  get the weekend kicked off St. Patrick's Day style.  And they're going to be on vacation next week.  So we're going to be doing the worst of all next week.  And I figure I'm going to throw on a few bits  between now and 7 o'clock  that we won't play during the worst of.  So make sure you're listening next week  as we go through a totally cool week  of worst of O&A stuff.  But again,  the guys are live at La Barbat,  57th Street,  between 8th and 9th.  From now until like 8 o'clock,  go down,  drink heavily,  and have a good time.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail? 
[02:55:30]  I disqualify myself because I've done them both.  Look at that, weirdo.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, I'm not sure, but I think,  I think we're on the radio, Anthony.  I'm not sure.  Really?  We're hanging out at La Barbat.  Let's do it, girl.  Let's do it, man.  57th Street,  between 8th and 9th, Anthony.  This place is absolutely insane.  Well, all we've had so far 
[02:56:00]  is a bunch of cans,  a bunch of girls getting up and wowing.  This has been great.  More women are showing up  than I think have ever shown up  at all of our appearances combined.  They're here today.  This is great.  A lot of wowing.  Come on!  Hey, Anthony,  as we're on the radio here,  why don't you ladies get on the chair  and wow our radio audience.  Okay, get on the chair.  Come on!  They're not wowing!  They may not want each other, 
[02:56:30]  but they're not going to wow?  Alright, they want a kiss.  You guys want to see them kiss or what?  Oh, the crowd.  Very, very disappointed, Anthony.  Very disappointed.  Come on!  The crowd speaks.  Anthony, the crowd is starting to shed.  We want gas.  I don't know what that means.  We want gas?  Yeah, we want gas.  I've never heard of that before. 
[02:57:00]  Is that an open wound?  Yeah, that is.  Yeah.  Alright, ladies,  why don't you make out for the crowd, ladies?  Make out for the crowd.  Okay, horrific.  Oh, God.  They're tugging each other.  How disgusting.  She's a chud?  A chud!  She's a chud?  What does chud mean?  Oh.  I don't know.  It's not like the fight sound, baby.  Alright, yeah.  Did you guys light that or what, huh? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, these guys are out for blood.  They're not happy with the performance that we just saw here at the little bar, man, Anthony.  He wants dyke!  What do you want dyke?  What?  Dyke?  What's dyke, Anthony?  Do you know what dyke?  Yes, he wants a huge earthen wall to hold back water.  I love you.  Hey, you guys having a good time at what, huh?  It's kind of hard to do a radio show when they're just shoving beer down your throat like this. 
[02:58:00]  What up, buddy?  I hear you.  I know.  We've got to get off the radio in a few minutes anyway and make way for Don and Mike,  and then we're going to be on vacation for a week.  We're done.  We are pretty much done until, I don't know, a week from Monday, I guess.  Yeah.  Rumors that there's a couple of lesbians at the corner bar over there.  But, yeah.  I'm just, like you said earlier, I'm amazed at all the women that showed up at the bar back. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, very happy with it.  We really appreciate that, because usually when we're out and about, it's like a sausage factory.  Yeah.  These guys are losing.  Yeah.  Show me, buddy.  Show me, buddy.  Show me, buddy.  Show me, Captain Cruz.  Show me, Captain Cruz.  Show me, Captain Cruz.  Yeah, we, I don't know, I think we need a few more, a few more ladies to come up. 
[02:59:00]  What's going on down there?  What's going on over here?  All the guys, all the guys are, all the guys are pointing at two really hot, hot women that are making their way to their stage, Anthony.  Two very hot women.  We're walking away on the stage here.  Oh, yes.  I think we might have some action.  Can I have on stage?  Can I have on stage?  People can dance anything.  I know.  Can I have on stage?  We've got to introduce Mike DiNicola to the crowd.  They're going to freak out in a minute. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you guys, that's the ladies making it to the stage.  We want to introduce you guys to someone very special to the radio show.  Come on.  Have you guys heard the full-blown AIDS song by now?  Yeah.  Full-blown AIDS.  You guys, Mike DiNicola, Mike DiNicola to my right, he wrote full-blown AIDS with his friend Jay Moore.  By the way, Mike whispered in my ear, in my ear, you assholes gag, that Jay Moore just called and said hi to everyone. 
[03:00:00]  He's going to be back too.  All right.  It would be great if we could get Jay Moore on the air, but we don't have this in that bag.  Hey, are the ladies making it to the stage?  Because we only have a couple minutes left in our radio show.  We are going to hang in the bar bed for at least another hour, maybe longer.  We'll see how it goes.  What happened to the ladies?  They gave up on us or what?  Oh, they failed, Anthony.  They failed on us. 
[03:00:30]  They're full-blown.  We all know.  All right.  Hey, it happened.  All right.  Well, there's not much going on that we can report as far as the radio goes.  No, no, no.  We have totally abandoned the radio show at this point.  But we're going to hang out here and we'll have a bar bed.  Done.  Now they're chanting pap smear.  I don't get what that's all about, actually.  The pap smear changes.  What's the pap smear changes about? 
[03:01:00]  We'll have to get ourselves a gynecological chair.  And it appears that we'll just do pap smears.  Pap smears?  Wouldn't that be amazing?  You might be onto something, Anthony?  Yeah, anyone to do live pap smear?  I can still say it.  I need to know that I can be here.  All right.  Listen, this obviously is just a mess on the radio.  So why don't we sign off so we can do some true party with our listeners, okay?  You guys, thanks for listening to the radio show.  We totally appreciate it. 
[03:01:30]  We're not going anywhere, but we've got to sign off.  So we'll be back a week from Monday, and we totally appreciate the support in this goddamn city.  And with that, we'll see you guys a week from Monday.  Thanks for listening.  China Mike, you're next on your radio.  It's Opie and Anthony.  LeBarbat. 
[03:02:00]  Turning off on the air, but we're still reading and partying here.  LeBarbat.  57.  This is Anthony.  I'm going to be in the air.  Come on, I'm going to have a beer with us, okay?  See you a week from Monday.  Thanks, guys.  Opie and Anthony.  Can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
