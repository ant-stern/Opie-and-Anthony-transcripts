<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, referring to themselves with offensive terms like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts."  They similarly insulted their crew.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to "Big A," a listener whose date cried and left a Patrice O'Neal comedy show after O'Neal insulted her. Big A, called in, reluctantly described the incident, his stuttering prompting speculation from the hosts about his date and their relationship. O'Neal's insult was eventually revealed to be a comparison to Larry Fine of the Three Stooges. A caller, Mike, accused them of stealing from Howard Stern, a claim they vehemently denied with offensive language.

Anthony then recounted a frustrating trip to Atlantic City, detailing problems with his expired license, ATM issues, and negative experiences with room service at both the Trump Marina and the Borgata. Kevin Smith joined the show in studio, discussing his time in their old studio and offering opinions on *War of the Worlds*, *Poseidon*, and *Dreamer*. The conversation also touched upon their return to terrestrial radio after previous controversies, specifically their firing from Infinity Broadcasting due to exaggerated media coverage of a seemingly innocuous on-air report about a sexual act near St. Patrick's Cathedral.  They detailed their two-year paid leave, the "Howard Clause" preventing them from discussing Howard Stern, and the difficulties of their transition to XM Satellite Radio, including a live walk from their CBS studio to the XM studio, featuring impromptu street interactions and comedian Rich Voss.  This segment also featured Kevin Smith (discussing *Clerks 2*) and Jay Moore as in-studio guests, a call from Jason Itzler (an incarcerated ex-escort agency owner), and a bizarre story involving Jay Moore's nudity in a dunking booth. Kevin Smith’s recent divorce and financial struggles were also discussed.

A phone call with the incarcerated Jason Itzler followed, covering his upcoming release, plans for a new business, an upcoming movie about his life (starring Jeremy Piven and Bryce Dallas Howard), and a physical altercation with a child rapist in Rikers Island.  The conversation included graphic descriptions of Itzler’s prison experiences and his reality show, "New York Confidential."  Back in the studio, the show featured increasingly vulgar and sexually explicit interactions with a guest named Bobby and Jay Moore, with repeated physical contact and the frequent use of "no homo." This segment also included a discussion of the show's daily "walk" segment and the upcoming release of *Clerks 2*.

A segment focused on their "Daily Dump Report," a list of FCC-flagged segments, detailing numerous instances of profanity and sexually explicit content. The discussion included listener claims of ripping off Howard Stern, descriptions of PalTalk, a detailed recounting of a comedian’s encounter involving a mustache and merkins, sexually charged commentary about women on webcam, an intern (Bobby) being pressured to show his genitals, a game called "Cock or Sack," Jay Moore's drug use, and his wife's constipation.  Multiple callers contributed, with one discussing Kevin Smith's show.

Kevin Smith returned to the studio, discussing movies (*X-Men*, *Over the Hedge*, *Cars*, *Poseidon*, *Mission Impossible 3*, *Clerks 2*), his sex life with Nikki Cox (including an anecdote about her thumb-sucking), and anecdotes about Tom Cruise and Al Pacino.  A pop culture quiz was interrupted by a graphic account of a violent altercation from a caller, Poe, and a mention of an Alice in Chains parody by a caller, Tom from Kentucky.  The segment ended anticipating a call from Taylor Hicks.

The final segment featured Jay Moore, Taylor Hicks (winner of *American Idol*), and Kevin Smith.  Moore discussed a rejected TV pilot, television show cancellations, and an anecdote from filming *Action* with Ice Cube and Buddy Hackett involving a racially charged joke. A caller, Craig, claimed to have fought off twelve attackers with a stick.  The discussion moved to Moore's experiences filming with predominantly Black casts, interrupted by Bobby, leading to a heated exchange.  The interview with Hicks, covering his *American Idol* experience, became contentious, with offensive language from the hosts causing his publicist to end the call abruptly.  This led to a lengthy discussion about blame, insults, and tangents, including the hosts' interactions with publicists, concluding with discussion of future guest appearances, Kevin Smith's Wizard World Philly appearance, and Jay Moore's stand-up shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the scene. 
[00:00:30]  Like Greg and Tony.  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boob that we paint him out to be.  Rice.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, go through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up! 
[00:01:00]  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:01:30]  He stinks and I don't like him. 
[00:02:00]  Alright, good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Greetings.  Is it Monday?  It's a Tuesday.  It is Tuesday?  It is a Tuesday.  Alright, the phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:02:30]  Be dialing, people.  Be dialing, be dialing.  We'll put it on the FlexPay.  We're all awake and ready to go?  Yeah.  Nice.  We've all had busy weekends.  Busy enough to make everybody go to sleep early.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was in bed at 8.  Aw, that's adorable.  Wide awake and ready to go today.  Barely.  Till later.  I know, exactly.  Till the phoned in portion of the show.  It starts at what? 
[00:03:00]  Like, uh...  I don't know, 9, 15.  Listen to anybody.  We do a lot of radio every day.  We certainly do.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi.  How's Mr. Norton?  Well, he had a great run at the Stress Factory over the weekend.  Yeah.  Six sold-out shows for Jim Norton at the Stress Factory.  Nice being back on the radio, huh, Jimmy?  Certainly is.  Look at that, packing the clubs again.  Yeah, it was lovely.  Look at you.  So thank you for coming, everybody.  That's good.  I heard Patrice O'Neill did really well at Caroline's, too. 
[00:03:30]  Patrice was at Caroline's, and I just heard horror stories.  Yeah.  I heard he was very funny, which, uh, you go see Patrice live, you're gonna laugh your ass off.  But, uh, somebody wasn't laughing, Opie.  Somebody was crying.  There's no crying at a comedy show.  Oh, there is one.  Patrice O'Neill's on the stage.  He can be roofless, and I say roofless with an F.  Because, uh, apparently our own Big A, uh, that big, uh, retard, um, stammering retard, brought a date. 
[00:04:00]  Now, how this happened, I haven't been on the boards, I've been away for the weekend, I'm sure it's all the little gossips or jibber-jabbering all over every, every corner of the internet about, uh, Big A's date.  But I don't know how he got it.  Uh, the last time he got a date, we had to set him up with Stalker Patty.  Did he pay for the date?  I don't know. 
[00:04:30]  I'm gonna love to hear the details.  It was probably a charity case.  You think?  Set up by his friends, like, come on, just do him a favor.  Or, I don't know, well...  And then it went horribly wrong?  Was she, is she good-looking?  I don't know.  See, this is all the info I need to know.  Is she a mess like him?  Exactly.  You would think she would have to be a mess.  But all I got, the only description I have, is that she has red hair, and I believe it might be curly.  So, you know, if Patrice was throwing around some Ronald McDonald jokes, I don't know, but that would be very funny. 
[00:05:00]  And, uh, I guess they had to be sitting within view of him, which is a stupid thing to do.  You go to a comedy club, especially with someone like Patrice that works the crowd, or Voss, or something like that.  Voss.  You don't want to be right up front.  Voss works the crowd well, but you don't get scared like he's gonna attack you.  Patrice is vicious.  Yeah, Patrice is vicious.  He is.  But Voss would be pretty nasty, though.  When I see Patrice, I even, uh, kind of just hide in the shadows, man. 
[00:05:30]  In the shadows.  I don't want any part of Patrice on a stage.  I have never, never in my life wanted to be the guy that sits there up front.  And Jay Moore, I guess, who's coming in later, uh, makes a great point about this.  He's like, these guys that just berate people, it's like, yeah, I came, I paid good money to sit here and have this idiot just insult me  in front of my girl or anything like that.  It's, it's degrading.  That's the beauty of it.  Jay's siding with the audience, but it's like, that's the beauty of being a comic. 
[00:06:00]  You just hurt somebody.  You can hurt somebody.  See, you take, you take all the comics years of being hurt and, and all that degradation they've had to go through in life to bring them to the point where they're a stand-up comic.  And now they can take it out on a room full of people with relative impunity.  So that's what they do.  Yeah.  Some worse than others.  The more abuse you've taken, the more, the things you've had to eat, the more you have eaten like Patrice.  Now you can let it all out on people.  So, Big A had a date and he took her within range of Patrice and Patrice laid into her. 
[00:06:30]  Just destroyed her.  Destroyed her for being with, for, with, for being with Big A, for her appearance and everything.  And usually these things end with, you know, well, it's okay, sweetie, I'm just kidding or whatever.  And you move on.  She, uh, apparently, word I have, got up, ran out to the bathroom where they, she was inconsolable.  Crying. 
[00:07:00]  How bad did he insult her if being on a date with him didn't hurt her?  Yeah.  That's the thing.  Maybe she was teetering on the edge from the start.  You could have said, hi, sweetie.  Wah!  With Big A.  She already knew she was a zero.  Right.  Because she saw who she was with.  She didn't eat anything.  Oh, it just had to be bad.  Well, we'll get an eyewitness report in a little while here on the show.  I'm certain.  But first, uh, we got to ask Anthony about A.C., Atlantic City.  Because you came in this morning, you had all sorts of problems.  I don't know what was going on. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Went to, uh, at first I pull out of Frontier, as I usually do.  And, um, I needed some money.  Because for some reason, I was, uh, I was trying to get money out of the ATM yesterday.  And I was being denied.  So I'm like, all right, I'll just wait till tomorrow.  It was probably this crappy, savage gas station, uh, ATM.  You want to save the story?  Because now Big A's on the line.  I don't know how long we got.  All right, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Let's go to Big A.  I didn't know he was going to call.  This show moves, people.  You've got to pay attention.  I didn't know he was going to call right away. 
[00:08:00]  Big A!  Yeah.  You know, thank God there's no one, uh, no faking that it's Big A.  Like, hey, Big A?  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, right?  This isn't Big A.  No.  You know it's Big A every time.  Here he is.  The big dope.  Uh, Big A, how are you today?  Thanks, I'm doing great, everyone.  Why would you ask him a question like that?  Just so I could hear him talk.  We only have enough time.  Just so I could hear him talk.  Now, Big A, you went to go see Patrice?  Yes, Anthony, we know that. 
[00:08:30]  All right, he went to go see Patrice.  Uh, Big A, you took a girl with you.  Yes, we know he took a girl.  How about you hit one button for yes and two for no?  I'd give better answers out of Captain Christopher Pike in that chair.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Big A.  So where do you, uh, meet this girl?  Good question.  Actually, actually, all she is is just a friend of mine. 
[00:09:00]  Of course.  A friend.  Another friend.  But now, Big A.  Yes.  Big A, get this.  When you have a friend, they don't just, you don't just show up and see them and go,  hey, you want to sit together.  There was a thing that happened here.  You have a friend and you had to ask her if she wants to go to a comedy club.  So that makes it a date.  Uh, actually, uh, I took, uh, I took a picture of her at the Bogota after, after, uh, after 
[00:09:30]  Jimmy's show.  Right.  And then what?  You kept in touch?  And then she sent me the picture.  I wrote kill on it.  So she sent you the picture.  So that started correspondence, right?  Uh, and then I thanked her.  Uh, uh, for the picture.  And, and then we began talking, uh, in, uh, AOL.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, and, and we spent a day, uh, in the city. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  So you, you planned to go, like, to, uh, out and you figured you'd go to the comedy club  and see Patrice.  See, that's a, but that's a date.  Yeah, but we were just, um, friends.  Well, that's how things slide sometimes.  Yeah, you, you, you're, you're trying to save yourself.  You're underplaying this.  Yeah, you're, you really wanted to go out with her, right?  Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, yeah, but... 
[00:10:30]  Oh, Jesus.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I...  You start today as good friends.  Right, right.  Yeah, of course.  You start out as good friends.  And then hopefully, now you're hoping something's going to come of this eventually.  Maybe not that night, but...  You're hoping friends with benefits.  With benefits.  I got friends with benefits. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, like right now, you're our best friends.  Who are you?  Yeah, great.  Yeah, great.  How great is it to hear about her boyfriend and her relationship troubles?  That's fantastic.  Yeah, has she got a boyfriend?  No, no.  All right.  Any other guy friends that she just talks about what a good time she has with?  Big A, why the lack of honesty?  You don't want to be friends with her.  You wanted more. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, gosh.  I'm telling you, we're just friends.  I'm happy with just being friends.  Yeah, I'm sure you are.  If she had a car accident and was severed below the waist, would you ever talk to her again?  Of course.  No, you wouldn't.  And if someone else comes along that will actually have sex with you, is she still your friend?  Oh, yeah.  Hold, hold.  What's her name?  Exactly.  Say in the Bronx, Big A must use a lot of minutes on his phone with the stutter. 
[00:12:00]  God, anytime battle.  The friend and stuttering ass program.  That would be a great project to see how many minutes he wastes just from his stutter.  And with Verizon, you can all you want.  Weekend.  Weekend minutes.  Unlimited.  Now, Big A. 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  You took her to Patrice's show.  Where were you sitting?  Well, unfortunately, I was right up in front, right next to him.  I didn't plan.  I should have been all in the back.  Right.  You should have been in the back.  Everyone knows that.  I don't know why you would sit in the front row.  Live and learn, Lloyd.  So, you know, you're sitting right up front and Patrice comes out. 
[00:13:00]  Now, can you describe this girl in the utmost honesty?  I want every possible detail of this girl that you took.  We only have two and a half hours left.  I know.  Sorry, people.  But I got to know.  Go ahead, Big A.  Actually.  Wow, I thought he hung up.  So did I.  Actually, what? 
[00:13:30]  Actually, nothing is wrong about you.  Very sweet and pretty.  All right.  How tall is...  Yeah.  We want stats.  We don't want sweet and nice.  Very sweet.  Who cares?  Sweet.  Sweet and pretty.  She got diabetes.  Sweet and pretty.  You want to use the word hot.  Sweet and pretty.  How tall is she?  Sweet and pretty equals fat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How tall is she?  So is a dachshund. 
[00:14:00]  Sweet and pretty.  How tall is she?  I think she's about 5'5".  Oh, 5'5", I think.  5'5".  Okay.  And what color hair?  Red hair.  Red hair.  Is it curly or straight?  It's curly.  And is it really curly?  Yes, it's really curly.  Nothing is wrong with red curly hair.  All right.  We said what?  All right, relax.  Mr. Defensive.  He's still thinking he might get laid.  Like, there are curly, like, long locks-off-the-shoulders curly, and then there's Annie Curly. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  Does she have Annie Curly hair?  Is she a bit chubby?  Did you go out with Raggedy Andy?  No, no.  It's not chubby at all.  Oh.  Comparatively speaking, right?  The stuttering retard's taking me out tomorrow.  Have to pretend I'm on my period tomorrow.  He'll want some.  What a way to start a wake-up radio. 
[00:15:00]  I can't understand a word he says.  Tomorrow.  Betty won't even have a dollar tomorrow.  He'll have none.  He'll get none.  He'll get none.  All right, Big A, so what happened with Patrice?  He'll strangle me tomorrow.  I wish he would go away.  So you and Annie go out, and you're sitting up front, and now what does Patrice do? 
[00:15:30]  What's the first salvo he fires out?  Oh, actually, he sees me and took my hand, and he has to wash my mouth.  This is Patrice.  Um, yeah.  Yes, if he's giving me, I mean, if she's giving me anything tonight. 
[00:16:00]  All right, so he asked if she was going to give you anything tonight.  And this is from the stage?  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  And what happened then?  And she goes, no, and we're just friends.  And then she goes, don't use A.  And then, actually, the worst part is he made fun of her hair. 
[00:16:30]  And, I mean, I won, sorry.  I won.  Wait, so, wait a minute.  So how did he make fun of her hair?  What was the joke?  Come on. 
[00:17:00]  Joke.  He made fun of her red hair.  I mean, he made her hair feel bad, and I don't want to keep going strong on it.  I mean, he really made her feel bad.  What did he say?  What did he say?  We got to know what he said.  You're just repeating it.  You're not making fun of her.  Yeah, what did he say about her red hair?  Her short, cropped, curly red hair. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  Big A.  Oh, my God.  Will you tell us?  When you went on your date with Frenchie from Greece, what did he say about her?  Come on.  Come on, Big A. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, it.  Big A, you might as well say it, because somebody that was at the show is going to call any second  to say it.  Yeah, just say it.  And they're going to say it in a lot less time than it takes you.  What did he say about her red hair?  I'm not going to say it.  What?  I'm not going to repeat it.  Why?  What's wrong with you?  We're trying to get to the bottom of it.  You really like this girl. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, she's a good friend of mine, and, you know.  She's not a good friend of yours.  Open hand to my friends.  If I was out with them and a comedian smashed them, I would repeat it in a second.  That's how you treat your friends.  You're not good friends after, like, two weeks.  Polish.  Polish.  Big A. 
[00:19:00]  Polish.  Yes, I'm here.  Come on.  What did he say about her?  Holy.  What was the joke that made her run into the bathroom and cry for the rest of the night?  What did he say?  God, oh my God.  You're frustrating the crap out of all of us.  Come on, Big A.  What did he say?  All you're doing is repeating what he said in public to a couple hundred people.  Come on. 
[00:19:30]  He said she looked like one of her hair looks like...  Like Larry Fine?  I guess.  That's what he said.  Hey, I'm out with Big A, everybody.  Hey, this is wonderful.  Oh boy, we're going to a comedy show. 
[00:20:00]  And look, I took Shemp.  I took Hybrid Shemp Curly.  He said that she kind of looked like the Three Stooges.  One of the dudes from the Three Stooges, huh?  What else?  Hey, I think that fat Negro is bothering me.  That's it.  What?  And then what happened?  Larry Fine.  Goddamn, Patrice, man.  You couldn't find a worse person to call a girl. 
[00:20:30]  Why, I ought to...  I'll show that, Schwarzer.  He looks like Larry Fine.  I'm warning you.  So...  I want to jerk.  Larry Fine.  So Patrice said that, and then what happened?  And...  And...  Then I turned back, and I saw her crying.  Huh?  I turned back, and I saw her crying.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Did you poke her in the eyes with your two fingers?  Boink!  No, no, no, no, no, no.  So, all right, so she started crying.  You're in the middle of Caroline's, in the front row, at a comedy show, obviously.  Yeah.  She's crying, so now what do you do?  She went to the bathroom, and ends up spending the rest of the show in the bathroom. 
[00:21:30]  I'm a cougar.  So then what'd you do?  Right after the show was over, I went out to the floor, I went out to the floor, as far as far as...  You stayed for the rest of the show?  Please tell me you just sat in the front row while your date's in the bathroom crying.  It wasn't, it was only the 10th, 15th minutes of the show. 
[00:22:00]  So, um, and afterwards I found out, Patrice apologized to her and bought her a beer.  So she apologized for crying, and you bought her a beer?  Well, Patrice did.  Patrice did.  Patrice, uh...  Oh, Patrice did.  Apologized at the end of the night and bought her a beer.  No, no, no.  And he got a huge laugh out of it, I'm sure.  He probably apologized just because it was you, just to be polite to you. 
[00:22:30]  And did she just run off?  Making a big scene as she ran through the club to go to the bathroom to cry?  I don't know if she made a big scene, she just walked out, and she was going to the bathroom.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's the story.  I'm sure there's more to it that we'll get to a little later on.  Right?  Big A?  There's no more of it.  I told you everything. 
[00:23:00]  By the way, that story could have taken 30 seconds.  30 seconds, big A.  You're sat there yucking it up, eating jalapeno poppers while she's in the bathroom, cutting  her wrists over a toilet.  What a lovely day.  Will you be seeing this girl again there, big A?  Yes, of course.  All right.  Probably not at the comedy show anymore, but...  Right, right.  Yeah.  The next time he sees her, he's going to be petting her hair in a barn.  Hey, she's a...  She's got a MySpace, huh? 
[00:23:30]  Big A?  Yes, she does.  Yeah.  Tammy's Place.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  MySpace.  Why is Jim holding his mouth?  Tammy's Place.  Jimmy, why are you holding your mouth as you look at the computer screen?  T-A-M-M-Y-S Place.  It's a photo of me and her.  Yeah, yeah.  That's her, uh...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You remember her now?  No, no, no.  I might have been in the show or something that we met.  You don't remember her?  No.  That means she's got to be awful.  No, it really looks like Curly.  If you don't remember her, she's got to be awful. 
[00:24:00]  With Jimmy's shaved head, it looks like Curly and Larry.  Hey, snap the picture, you.  Jimmy only remembers the pretty ones, so...  There's got to be some problems there.  All right, big A, thanks for, uh...  Really slowing down the show right off the bat today.  All right?  Okay.  All right, we'll talk to you soon, big A.  Bye, sweetie.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, click.  I'm sure we'll get more to the story as the morning goes on.  Mike in Manhattan, what's up?  Guys, I love your show, but I got a complaint, man. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Okay, you know, we all know Ho-Ho's a hypocrite, but you guys are stealing his act.  I mean...  Oh, Jesus.  How are we stealing his act, you brainwashed fucking puppet?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Hey, Mike, Mike, how are we stealing his act?  How are we stealing his act?  Go ahead.  We need to know.  We all need to know.  Go ahead.  Speak for all the Howard listeners that didn't follow him to Satellite Radio.  95% of people.  We're sitting there waiting.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  How are we ripping off Howard?  How are we stealing his act? 
[00:25:00]  Go ahead.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Larry Fine, the stuttering...  Larry Fine was Billy West, and he was a genius, and Howard screwed him.  Goodbye, Mike.  Billy West doing an impression of Larry Fine is ripping off Howard?  What about the stuttering?  You're stealing his act.  Stuttering?  The guy doesn't stutter.  He can't talk.  If he stuttered, it wouldn't be funny.  The guy is...  You're stealing his act.  Come on.  We all know it. 
[00:25:30]  You know something?  Get up.  Stop listening to this show.  Wait, I...  Right now.  Stop.  No, you're not allowed.  No more listening for you.  And we'll track you.  I could...  I'll track you, Mike.  This is the beauty of a dope like this.  Do you know how Big A came onto this show?  Wait a minute.  No, hold on.  This is like...  Mike, you really are.  Now your chance to listen, jerk.  Do you know how he came onto this show?  We didn't go out and go, hey, let's find a guy who stutters to ask questions.  He was online at one of our events coming into the studio.  Danny's interviewing listeners outside.  And Big A happened to be one of the guys that he was just interviewing. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, how are you?  Looking forward to coming in.  And this mess gets on the phone and Ope goes, who was that?  And Danny goes, oh, it's this guy, Andrew.  He goes, put him back on the phone.  I said, bring him upstairs.  How do you not address that and use this guy?  And you ever hear of a guy called Mel Tillis, you idiot?  Who's Mel Tillis?  Mel Tillis is a guy that got on TV and said,  he stuttered.  He was a stutterer and people would laugh their asses off.  You ever watch sitcoms from the 50s and there's stutterers on them  and it's funny because they're stuttering? 
[00:26:30]  Your hero, Howie, didn't invent crap.  Jerk off, Mike.  Okay?  Guys, I like you guys.  We don't like you.  Go away.  We hate you.  I like Mike.  Enough.  Enough with the Howard ripoff.  Take the goddamn Howard brainwashing corks out of your ears, you jerk.  And open your mind.  I love Mike, but I like you.  I don't give up.  Wait.  The goddamn Einstein of radio that invented everything, Mike. 
[00:27:00]  You didn't answer my question, though.  What are you supposed to do with a guy like that on the phone?  Yeah.  How do you not bring him up?  Right.  Mike.  Why wouldn't you?  Wait.  Anthony, I'd like to challenge you right now.  All right.  Challenge.  Answer that question.  Answer the question, though.  Why wouldn't you bring him up into the studio?  When Oprah heard that, he goes, get him up here.  Get him up here.  Right.  What kind of a dumb radio show wouldn't you?  You don't steal his act.  Howard was doing it first.  Shut up, Mike.  Howard didn't do anything first, you ass.  Man, you're such a brainwashed jerk-off, and so many people now are seeing what the truth 
[00:27:30]  is.  Why didn't you go to satellite radio?  Go to the revolution over there.  It's serious.  The revolution where nothing is happening.  Yeah.  Why didn't you go to satellite radio, Mike?  Why didn't you go with 95% of the thing?  Why are you listening to us?  He's on right now, idiot.  Go listen to him.  Stop listening.  Stop listening.  Well, we don't like you.  We already said it.  So we made your choice for you.  Go away, Mike.  Go away.  We made the choice for you. 
[00:28:00]  Do you get it?  Go the fuck away.  Wait a minute.  Can I do some impersonation?  No, you can't.  Do the impersonation of someone Opie's hanging up on.  I've had it with you.  Asshead.  Another brainwashed thinks it's 1994, idiot.  How many calls?  What happened?  How many calls do we get every so often?  There's one every so often.  Every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  And why aren't they over there? 
[00:28:30]  Why aren't they over there?  Why is Tom mad at us now?  Because we're yelling at...  Take a break.  Oh, we're taking a break?  Because we cursed twice?  All right.  We got to take a break.  Good place to stop for now.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Don't patronize us, though.  Or patronize us.  I thought we were going to be repatriated.  Don't patronize us, though, and say, but I like you guys. 
[00:29:00]  You know what?  Shut up.  Shut up.  That's not going to go far with us.  If you like both, then we make the choice for you.  Go over there.  If you got your stupid satellite.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  All right.  Let's get some energy back into this program.  Thank you, Big A, for doing what you do, I guess.  I don't know.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:29:30]  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  So we were talking to Anthony about Atlantic City.  That's where you went over the long holiday weekend, right?  Little Atlantic City.  I like playing a little of the poker, the three-card poker.  Play that, too.  Play some Hold'em.  But I went down there, and I took my winnings from Foxwoods.  If you remember last time.  You got this whole system, right?  Yeah.  You got a drawer filled with money you're going to gamble with?  I got my gambling fund, which is pretty good because it rarely ever runs out. 
[00:30:00]  And I take the money that I won.  So you're one of the lucky ones.  At one place.  And I throw it down there.  No, I was lucky last time at Foxwoods because I had to leave.  Had to leave.  It was time to go.  And I was up.  Believe me, if I was able to stay, I would have lost it all.  That's what happens.  That's the key, obviously.  Everyone talks about it.  You've got to know when to walk away, but no one knows when to walk away.  You're forced when to leave is pretty much it.  That's when you walk away, winner.  So it went pretty big at Foxwoods, and I threw it in the drawers, in the drawer at home. 
[00:30:30]  And now we went to Trump Marina.  In Atlantic City?  I like going to the Borgata.  Yeah.  What happened to the Borgata?  It was booked.  Booked up solid.  So I'm trying all night to try to find some place.  And the only place that had Friday, Saturday, and Sunday was the Trump Marina.  Not a good sign, when the only place that you can get a room in is one place.  So I had my hookup at Foxwoods, but he didn't get back to me until Friday. 
[00:31:00]  So I wound up having to go to the Trump Marina.  Five-hour drive down there on Friday afternoon.  Five-hour.  Should take, what, two and a half?  Two and a half, yeah, from the city.  Unbelievable, the traffic.  But Memorial Day weekend, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  That's why we're hoping that gas prices continue to go up.  Yeah, that's it.  Because it means less traffic on the road.  Please.  We want to hit.  Ten dollars a gallon is what I'm gunning for.  That's right.  And I get down there, start doing a little of the gambling. 
[00:31:30]  Just getting raped.  Just getting raped at the table.  Can't win.  Have a few wins here, but for the most part.  Three-card, three-card poker.  Three-card, yeah.  They don't have, and they don't have Hold'em down at Trump Marina.  You got to go, yeah, they only have like at a couple of places down there.  They're in Atlantic City.  They have the Hold'em.  So I had to play three-card poker, which I don't mind.  It's kind of fun.  Winning, losing, losing, losing, losing, losing, losing. 
[00:32:00]  Wind up losing.  Have to go get more money.  Go up to the cage.  Now, believe me, I'm good for it.  I got my little debit card thing.  I go up there.  I go through the whole rigmarole.  You got to go through sliding your card, filling paperwork out, go to some guy behind the cage.  And my driver's license seems to be expired.  You can do it by mail or on the Internet.  But I'm sick of showing everybody the godforsaken picture that is on my license from 19 – it is a 1980-something picture that is on my license. 
[00:32:30]  I took a picture last time.  I took – I have my license.  But for some reason, I get it in the mail, and it's the old picture where I have hair down to my shoulders.  It's ridiculous.  I want a normal picture.  So I didn't go down, and I have to go to a motor vehicle, and I've been putting it off because I'm a procrastinating ass, and I had an expired license. 
[00:33:00]  But by a few days, not that bad.  The guy starts giving me crap at the cage.  I'm like, well, your license is expired.  Yeah, but my card isn't.  The balance on it isn't.  Give me some money here.  I need to support you guys.  I need to lose more money.  And he's chastising me, and he won't give me any more money.  He won't – that son of a bitch at Trump Marina won't give me more money for me to lose because my license was expired by a few days. 
[00:33:30]  If I had a fake license, don't you think I'd make one with a good date on it that isn't expired?  What is it, not you anymore after it expires?  Yeah, after it expires, it's not me.  Well, they got rules.  They got rules and regs, man.  Regs that they must adhere to.  I can understand, you know, loss prevention.  They don't want – but, you know, they check these things out.  Believe me, they know exactly what the balance is on the card.  They know who it is.  They know what it is.  It's – just fork over the cash. 
[00:34:00]  Fork it over.  So they said sorry.  They said sorry.  So I wound up having to, like, go to the ATM 50 times, pulling money out.  And when you do that, your bank, of course, who's also looking after you, they put a stop on your goddamn card.  So I'm taking too many ATM withdrawals out.  So this morning, I go and take a little walk with Master Poe to get some money out of the ATM.  Bam, denied.  Like, now I'm broke. 
[00:34:30]  I can't take any money out.  None of my cards work.  They, like, shut down my card.  I had to call the bank, which is a treat.  50 buttons pushed later, I actually get a human being that says now I could use my card.  But it's – I get the whole thing.  I understand.  There's a lot of identity theft and a lot of this crap out there.  But for the love of God, I'm here in Atlantic City at your goddamn casino that I don't even want to be at anymore.  Please allow me the privilege of giving you the money back. 
[00:35:00]  You're getting it back anyway.  Please let me lose my money.  You're getting it back anyway.  Right.  So now it turns out I called up the bank and they're like, oh, there was a problem down there at Trump Marina.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, there was a problem down there.  He goes, well, we cleared all that up.  He goes, there seems to be a reversal on the money that you took out there.  I go, what's a reversal?  He goes, it was put back in your account.  He goes, I guess they saw a problem and put it back in the account. 
[00:35:30]  I go, well, the guy gave it to me.  You should have told him.  Look, someone, I don't know what went on down there.  Someone must have taken my money.  So apparently in between the time he finally did cough up like enough money for me.  Wasn't what I wanted, but he coughed up enough.  And the time he handed it to me, the bank declined it.  So I got the money and it hasn't come out of my account yet.  You think they're going to have to?  Hey, when they find it, they find it. 
[00:36:00]  Screw them.  That's right.  Screw them.  Donald.  Yeah, it's your buddy, right?  The Donald.  He's not my buddy.  Get the Donald on the phone.  He's all right.  We had him on the air a couple of times.  That son of a bitch.  I should have had a suite in that hell hole, that slum.  I should have had a suite in there.  Is the hotel looking old now?  Of course it is.  Compared to Borgata?  Anything but the Borgata over there.  The Borgata should be the new, like, that's the benchmark for Atlantic City. 
[00:36:30]  Everything else is just, like, crap with old waitresses that are walking around.  Nothing beats the trop for the old waitresses.  Oh, they are beyond cougars.  They've gone to old toothless pumas.  That's what they're wandering around there.  They're alley cats.  Oh, they're the worst waitresses ever.  They got the Borgata babes down at the Borgata.  Hot, walking around, little skirts, always attentive with the drinks.  They fire you if you put weight on exactly as it should be. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  That's right.  They have a thing where if you gain too much weight, boom, out you go.  And the Trump Marina, you know, you're sitting there.  Everyone's gambling, losing some money and everything.  But can you make the drinks a little better?  I asked for just a glass of wine.  It was like grape juice with rubbing alcohol in it.  It was awful.  The worst drinks you can ever get.  And the Borgata's nice with the drinks.  You could order something maybe, a little something different than the swill they bring you at the other places. 
[00:37:30]  Because I was disgusting.  You didn't have a sweet?  No, no sweet.  No nothing.  Sweet.  No comps.  Like in the old days.  You know, the good old days.  Vegas, things like that.  You get comp.  They give you the room if you're gambling.  Now you've got to give this card.  And then as you gamble, you work up these points.  They all have got cute names.  Trump points and, you know, whatever points.  And then you give them your card and they're good for whatever amount of points you got on there. 
[00:38:00]  You could get a free brunch at the buffet.  It should be Trump plugs.  Yeah.  Trump plugs.  Trump weaves.  Yeah.  Collect your Trump plugs.  What a pompous ass he is.  His picture is on the chips.  So as you're winning, you're even losing.  Because you've got to look at his friggin' dopey face all over the chips.  Except on the low denominations.  Ones and fives.  He doesn't want any part of those.  He doesn't want his name on those.  It's like the building is on there.  When you get into the hundreds, that's when you get the Trump. 
[00:38:30]  All right, enough.  Oh, that's really funny.  How is the Bregada, though, to not hook you up?  Huh?  How dumb is the Bregada to not hook you up?  Yeah, no kidding.  I called because I never pull the card.  I don't try.  I got on the phone.  I'm like, do you know who I am?  Do you know who I am?  I pulled it at the cage, though, and the guy wouldn't give me money.  I said, punch up the CBS website.  It's me!  There I am!  Screw my expired license.  And you still wouldn't do it?  No!  How was the room? 
[00:39:00]  I'm right there on the web.  How was the room?  The room stunk.  Paper-thin walls.  I got one of those doors that lead to another room that have happy drunks at five in the  morning strolling in and banging on everything.  And no, and Anthony, he's just staring at that door all night long wondering if it's going  to open.  Oh, I was, too.  I had all the locks.  Everything's latched.  The walls and the doors.  And I understand.  It's Atlantic City.  You know, people are partying.  It's not like a church group. 
[00:39:30]  So you're three in the morning walking down the hall.  You're going to get people yelling and talking.  But the refrigerator in the place?  I go, I go, what do you think?  Mini bar or fridge?  I open it.  It's a fridge.  No mini bar.  No safe in there.  So you can't even, like, put your chips and stuff in a safe.  The room service people come in and their nosy, busy bodies.  Like, I hate when room service people come in and I'm in bed.  I don't want you looking at me in bed.  So I'm, like, covered up.  I put the covers over my head. 
[00:40:00]  And they roll in and they want to talk.  Hello, how are you today?  Everything good?  Going good?  Beautiful day out?  And he's looking at what I'm watching on TV.  Just put this stuff down.  Leave my food and go.  And don't put your finger in that goddamn metal thing that covers the food.  It's there for a reason.  I don't want it.  His finger is in there and it's probably hitting the top of my burger and stuff.  You're a real fan.  Just leave it on there.  It's a cover.  I can deal with it.  They have to show you everything. 
[00:40:30]  Here is your soup.  Here is your burger.  Here's your pizza.  Here's the...  Just leave the covers on it.  I'll take care of it.  If you've got something wrong, I'll make a call.  And yell at you till you're fired.  I don't want them uncovering my food.  Because through that hole, I've had many times little savage fingerprints in my mashed potatoes.  Because it goes right through.  They scoop a little out at the point of nail.  And you know it's just filthy.  They're just filthy animals.  Huffing into it, touching their children. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Hacking into their hand.  Here to do.  And they want to unwrap everything.  Like there's cellophane over the soup.  I can see through it.  I see it's soup.  Stop with the cellophane.  Leave it on.  I never thought twice that they may touch my food.  When they put their finger through the hole.  Who cares?  Leave it alone.  Who cares?  There's more germs on your doorknob.  They got to.  I'm not eating my doorknob.  Leave it alone.  Wheel it in.  Who cares?  And then we try to stop them too.  Like my girlfriend knows I don't like being looked at while I'm laying in bed. 
[00:41:30]  I'm a wreck.  And they walk in.  And she goes, okay.  No, you can leave it right there.  And we try to tell them.  Leave it!  Please tell me she actually has to say don't look at him.  And yes, don't look at him.  Don't look at the TV.  Don't comment on the day.  Don't open the curtains.  Don't touch anything.  Put your fingers out of the.  Leave your fingers out of the metal hole in the cover.  Little Anthony just naked under his sheets.  Yeah, exactly.  Nude.  Maybe tight tighty-whities on. 
[00:42:00]  That's about it.  Nude.  Oh, I just spent the whole week in there eating, burping, drinking.  There's pubes all over the place.  Just pulling them out.  Walking around in those awful diaper white underwear.  They're not diapers.  Those underpants stink.  They're not diapers.  All right.  William Frawley underwear.  Shut up.  No, I wear boxers.  Exactly.  Silk boxers.  And so did Bill Frawley.  Silk boxers.  Boxer briefs.  Let's go.  We got to take a break.  Kevin Smith is here.  He's stopping by to say hi. 
[00:42:30]  Cool.  Clerks 2 coming out, right?  Yep.  When?  Soon?  Better be.  All right.  Kevin Smith is going to join the program.  Jay Moore stopping by today.  Jay Moore.  I think in about an hour.  And also, maybe later today, if we feel like doing a lot of radio, we get to talk to Taylor  Hicks, the winner of American Idol.  What time?  Like 1110.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we'll try to figure that one out.  Oh.  Actually, Ben, try to get him to, like, I don't know, call in earlier.  Get that gray-haired ass on the phone. 
[00:43:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The O-N-A virus spreading across America.  This local tavern appears to be quite festive.  It's a friendly bunch in here.  Seems to be mustache night.  Perhaps I'll belly up to the old bar and request a libation.  Ramon, fetch me a bikini-tini and then push in my stool.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:43:30]  The O-N-A virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE.  Kevin Smith in studio to join the program.  Good morning.  Good morning, Kevin.  Good morning, Kevin.  Isn't this something?  Our digs?  Our new digs?  I've got to say, it's hauntingly familiar.  You've been in here.  I've had the sense that I've been here before.  I don't know why.  You've been in here.  Deja vu.  Last time I was here, though, there were no windows in this place.  Yeah.  What a waste.  Look at that great big window behind you, man. 
[00:44:00]  And look at that great view of another building.  Yeah.  We've seen some nudity through there.  Yeah, there's some girl that would exercise.  We haven't seen her in a while.  But she's shut her shades, and they haven't opened yet.  And she could be dead just smelling the apartment up.  You guys are nudity magnets.  Yeah.  Just love it.  Last time I was with you guys, people were having sex.  Yeah, that's true, right?  Remember on the cam?  Oh, on the PalTalk.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we don't have the PalTalk hooked up in here.  I don't know why.  They kept promising that we were going to get it. 
[00:44:30]  And the computers are here.  The PalTalk cameras are here.  But for some reason, it's not hooked up yet.  Right.  Eagerly awaiting that, because people like that.  That was the best part of waking up.  Yes.  Folgers in my cup that morning.  A little bit of cyber sex.  Oh, my God.  Stephen from Bayshore.  Make sure you grill Kevin over recommending War of the Worlds.  Somebody didn't agree with that?  Remember, I think I asked you.  I said, what's the...  Did you watch it finally?  I hate it.  I watched it.  I watched it again.  I hated it.  And I like it. 
[00:45:00]  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I've met with people that don't like it either and kind of make crap for it.  But I like it.  I think it's not.  You've got to get over the cruise factor in it.  Is that what bugs you about it, the crew?  No, it was just...  It was so hokey, like...  Watching those things walk across that hill?  Yeah, it was so cool.  That stuff was cool.  It looked great.  But the continuity in the movie was ridiculous.  And I take that stuff pretty seriously.  The son should have died.  I'll give you that.  The son should have died.  Don't make it a happy ending where everybody's alive.  Kill the kid. 
[00:45:30]  Well, they collect all this food to go to the other house.  And this other house is like this beautiful, pretty much like mansion.  And it has like a refrigerator.  They didn't even check the fridge.  They didn't even check the fridge or the cupboards for food.  Some little details.  And then how about...  He was trying to be polite to his wife and her wife.  Polite?  The world is going to get destroyed.  And then they go to sleep downstairs, right?  And they wake up in the morning.  They didn't notice that a jumbo jet crashed into their house.  They noticed.  They all ran down into the basement.  They thought it was one of those big things destroying the neighborhood. 
[00:46:00]  But it turned out to be it was a plane that crashed.  And then he walks upstairs and there's the fuselage in his living room.  And he's just casual about it.  They're in the basement.  Weren't there no bodies or something, too?  Like no bodies all over the place?  Yeah, I think they were zapped.  And why was his the only car that ran?  Explain that one, Kevin.  The Solenoid.  They had to replace the Solenoid.  They did explain that.  They did explain that in the beginning.  The guy was fixing something.  The electromagnetic...  So why couldn't he fix other people's cars?  He could only fix one car?  He was zapped like a second later, remember?  Like Tom Cruise driving away and the dude... 
[00:46:30]  He's got an answer for everything.  And he gets pride.  There was an electromagnetic pulse from these things that killed the Solenoid in the cars.  Of all cars except for Tom Cruise's because...  No, no.  He had to replace it.  Yeah, I know.  Because the mechanic helped him out.  Replaced it.  But then the mechanic got zapped right after that.  He left it in his car, though.  He ran over to the mechanics and he stole the car the dude was working on.  I mean, you can't just take a Solenoid out of any car and put it into any car.  You need like a Solenoid that works.  And then he's driving down the highway and all the cars are off to the side of the road.  That's always a little convenient. 
[00:47:00]  Even Independence Day.  Come on.  They drove down to Washington.  One side of the road was plugged.  That seems to be the thing to fear the most in the case of an alien invasion is how traffic-ridden...  Traffic-ridden.  Every one of those movies, it's just like a series of...  Because it was five hours to drive down to Atlantic City.  And that was just Memorial Day weekend.  Picture giant aliens blasting people.  That's where you just run across the car top.  But they're all swerved out of the way, so he had a perfect path down the road, more or less.  It's like...  I picture rush hour traffic.  Everyone's batteries die at the exact same time. 
[00:47:30]  The cars are just in that position.  You didn't find Lil' Dakota Fanning adorable?  I thought she was dope.  She was in that movie.  She was adorable.  I thought they could have done a much better job.  I think she's a midget with that acting ability.  A grown-up human being that just happens to be a midget.  Them's not babies.  Them's fidgets.  Yeah, I like that movie, man.  I know some people don't, but I dug it.  Yeah.  It wasn't bad, but...  Now you're reigning it in.  Now you went for...  It was horrible.  It was better. 
[00:48:00]  Basement scene.  It was pretty tense.  Well, you explained some things to me, so...  I used to be there when you watched it.  And we could pause it, and you could vent, and I could think about it like this.  It's just a movie.  I'm like, all right, we'll watch it more.  I bought it on your recommendation and watched half, and I didn't...  Half?  Not something happened.  You must have loved it.  Not something happened.  I'll watch the rest.  Yeah.  All right.  I saw Poseidon.  And?  I kind of liked it.  And that movie's getting horrible reviews.  Yes.  I went to see that opening weekend as well. 
[00:48:30]  I'll tell you why I liked it.  And I never thought I would say this, but I prefer the original to the...  The original?  Really?  Wow.  Well, the original has a better story.  Leslie Nielsen as the captain alone makes it a better movie.  It's lacking a Kelly Winters fact.  Yeah, better story, better characters, and much better dialogue.  Right.  The dialogue in this Poseidon is god-awful.  It felt like there were maybe 15 lines in the whole movie.  Yeah, they didn't talk much either.  One good thing they had going for them is they start moving toward that wave like within  the first 10, 15 minutes.  Really? 
[00:49:00]  Well, the movie's only an hour and 15 minutes.  It's short.  I don't think it's an hour and a half.  I don't want to know so much about...  Like the old Irwin Allen disaster movies were always about the first hour was having to  learn about everybody's life.  Setting up the world.  Setting it all up.  Right.  And then the disaster and how their different personalities work out.  Just flip the boat over.  For God's sake, we'll learn about them later.  I'll tell you.  But then it'll make you, if you see the new one, you'll long for Irwin Allen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they get to the boat flip way too early and you just don't care about anybody. 
[00:49:30]  You know what everybody's forgetting?  That in between, there was a TV movie Poseidon made that everyone forgot about.  I just, I tuned it in this weekend.  It was on.  Steve Guttenberg.  Yeah, Steve Guttenberg.  I tuned it.  I'm tuning in and I see a scene from the upside down.  It just flipped.  The Christmas tree is up against the ledge up top.  They're climbing up.  And I'm expecting to see, you know, Cornelius from Planet of the Apes.  What's his name?  Rodney McDowell.  He'll always be Cornelius to me. 
[00:50:00]  Expecting to see him.  And I see this big bloated Steve Guttenberg up on top.  I'm like, what the hell movie is this?  And it was like, oh yeah, they made a TV movie Poseidon.  That's always convenient to do.  Yeah.  And they made with like five million bucks.  Yeah, five million bucks.  And they always put it out.  I think they do that on purpose when they know that a major theatrical version is coming out.  So it confuses people and they watch it.  I saw Poseidon on the iMac, though.  That's what made it great.  What did you download it?  I mean, the iMac.  IMac.  I keep saying iMac for some reason. 
[00:50:30]  iMac.  That's what made it great.  Watched it on the computer.  It's wonderful.  I was like, wow, streaming.  Yeah, yeah.  I would imagine that would make it a little bit better.  And Kurt Russell was there.  And Kurt Russell.  You can't go wrong with Kurt Russell.  Well, overboard.  I saw Dreamer, dude.  I saw Dreamer, the movie with him and Dakota Fanning last summer.  And that made me cry.  I thought it was really good.  And nobody ever thought to put him into a movie with Chris Christopherson and make Chris Christopherson his dad.  It was such a genius.  No, no.  There's one Kurt Russell movie, though, that is just the best. 
[00:51:00]  Him, Sly Stallone.  For action and laughs.  For action.  For action and laughs all in one major motion picture.  Tango and cat.  Tango and cat.  Nothing beats it for just laugh after laugh.  Oh, what a fantastic motion picture.  Intentional and unintentional laughs, or are they all unintentional?  Oh, it's just the barbs, the witty barbs, you know.  That could not be funny ever.  Under any circumstances, under any drug, it can't be funny. 
[00:51:30]  Stallone trying to be charming is enough to make my stomach turn.  Whenever he wears glasses and tries to cut it, he's smart.  Hey, thanks for driving in.  That was a pretty good question.  Oh, really?  Hey, thank you.  Okay.  We're going to go to the zoo and see the tigers.  The zoo, the tigers, the retard.  Do you have any interest in the Rocky sequel that's coming out?  Purely humorous.  Really?  No, but actually I hear it's, if it was just Rocky getting in the ring again and trying to  pull off the same thing, but them acknowledging that he's older and this is like the last hurrah 
[00:52:00]  could be good.  Not calling it Rocky, whatever the number is, you know, just called Rocky Balboa.  That's kind of cool.  What's he doing in it?  Is he fighting again?  Yeah.  Ugh.  It's going to stink.  There's some boxing involved.  It's going to stink.  Of course there's boxing involved.  What is he fighting his dignity in a room?  Tries to find it.  It sounds like a better story than I thought it was going to be.  Yeah.  That's all.  That's all.  If they did the right thing, maybe he'll die in the end. 
[00:52:30]  I think that would be a point.  That would be.  But you know something?  What movie where people die in the end does well?  It's really.  Schindler's List.  Hard to smell.  There you go.  I poth on you.  Want an Oscar?  We're in the opening of credits.  I think.  Okay.  High body count.  Let me.  When they expect people to die, high body count.  Then it does well.  Whenever like the lead character dies, we found out that the movie doesn't really do very well.  There was a big movie this weekend where a couple of lead characters died. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  Very well.  No, you made a good point, too, because Titanic really bombed.  Well, one of them died.  Yeah.  One of the leads died.  One didn't.  And one had their heart go on.  Yes, go on.  Fat pig hanging onto a door.  My life will go on.  So, can we talk about you guys coming back to Terrestrial? 
[00:53:30]  Sure.  We haven't talked about it in the past, but I haven't.  This is just ridiculous that they hired us back.  It's insane.  It makes no sense, does it?  It's just like you can't be here anymore, and then they're like, please come back.  This was.  That's pretty much how it went out.  We were such persona non grata to the entire company for years.  Right.  There was a literal hatred between the two camps.  Right.  When they gave us the boot, we felt that, yeah, what we did, pretty tasteless, awful, a lot of outrage.  But if they just wouldn't have knee-jerked and kept us in there. 
[00:54:00]  But you guys didn't actually do it.  Other people did it.  You just talked about it.  No.  Other people did it.  We talked about it.  But not even that.  Like, the newspaper blew it so far out of proportion.  There was a couple in St. Pat's.  Right.  And a spotter was with them.  And what we got was a phone call.  Bloop.  We plunked the line down.  He goes, we're here at St. Pat's, and they're doing balloon knot.  That's all that was said.  And in the paper, it was a blow-by-blow sexy description of graphic sex at St. Pat's. 
[00:54:30]  And we're like, that never, ever happened.  Feet away from worshipers.  Yes.  Only feet away from worshipers.  It was like me and Opie were homos on the altar.  That's the picture that the press was trying to do.  Give me the chalice.  Yeah.  Give me the chalice.  I'm almost there.  I want to make a cocktail out of it.  Like, they pictured just the most heinous thing because of the way it was reported when,  in all actuality, the broadcast itself was well within FCC compliance.  We didn't curse.  There wasn't any graphic description of sex. 
[00:55:00]  There was a knee-jerk because some people got on Viacom, who at the time owned Infinity.  Who we worked for.  There was a lot of companies that Viacom owned.  Paramount Pictures, Blockbuster Video.  So when you get this big conglomeration, all these other companies are going,  Hey, what if these two idiots make it so people don't come into Blockbuster or don't watch Paramount Pictures or buy this brand of coffee or whatever the hell else they owned at the time?  So they said, Well, two heads.  Lop them off.  And we went. 
[00:55:30]  They paid us for the two years we were out.  At that point, you guys were on this station?  We were on WNEW.  WNEW right down the road.  WNEW and about 20 others.  About 20 other markets around the country do an afternoon drive.  And was it part of Infinity or was it part of?  Infinity Broadcasting.  But Infinity was part of Viacom, which owns everything.  Since then, they've split.  They've split.  And now it's just CBS Radio.  So they got rid of us.  But they had to pay us to keep us from working somewhere else.  See, they did not want us to work.  The truth is against Howard. 
[00:56:00]  Clear Channel would have picked us up and put us in mornings against Howard Stern.  They didn't want that.  So they just paid us to keep us off the air for two years.  So now in the two years that you were off the air and paid to be off the air, are you struggling against the two feelings of like, boy, it'd be nice to work.  But this is awesome getting paid now.  Every friend we know was like, dude, dude, you're getting paid, right?  How cool is this, dude?  Dude.  You're getting paid.  You do nothing.  I wouldn't be in that camp, sir. 
[00:56:30]  I would be in the dude camp.  Dude.  But for the first few, like even months, it's cool.  You're like, I got the world at my fingertips.  Whatever I want to do.  You can sleep to.  Where do I want?  Let me spin the globe and throw a dart.  Where am I going this week?  Doesn't even matter.  Amex, it's all on Infinity Broadcasting.  It was great.  The first three months, I would say, was great.  After that, you're like, man, first of all, this isn't a job.  Right.  And we could get paid by someone else to have fun because that's what we do. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, we love doing radio.  And you're a creative person.  When they're telling you you're not allowed to create, that plays with you a little bit, too.  After a few months, you're sitting there going, you realize, hey, now I'm not working on St. Thomas.  And now I'm not working in California.  Wherever you are, it's like you're not working.  And the bitch of it is, everyone you know has jobs.  So you can't hang with your friends.  You're not hanging out.  It's not like you're in your early 20s, like, hey, let's get some beer and go to the beach for the day. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, everybody you know is working.  You're pretty much by yourself.  So you wind up doing a lot of traveling at first.  And then you just wind up calling your agent and going, dude, anything?  Is there anything on the horizon even?  A light at the end of the tunnel?  And that's an XM satellite.  They were constantly inquiring, but always at loggerheads.  We had the opportunity to get out of the deal with Infinity, but they had this big, long contract written up that we wouldn't be able to talk about past, present, future employees of the company. 
[00:58:00]  Well, it was the Howard Clause.  It was the Howard.  They didn't want us talking about Howard.  Let's be honest here.  It was the Howard Clause.  And every time we mentioned Howard, as we moved forward with our careers, it would cost us $100,000 each.  Yeah, it would have cost us $100,000.  Under this contract?  Under this thing that would get us out of the contract so we could go work for Clear Channel or whoever else at the time.  Or someone else.  So we just decided, look, we're done with this.  How do we move forward?  And they wanted this for the rest of our careers.  So it's like, how do we move forward with our radio careers and never mention that ass that was not cool to us whatsoever? 
[00:58:30]  We couldn't talk about why we got fired, like what happened.  But like people wanted to know what happened to us for two years.  We wouldn't have been able to mention it.  So how did you get around it?  We didn't sign the contract.  We sat out.  We sat out for two years, almost two and a half years.  And then XM came along after we were done getting paid off by Infinity.  And they hired us.  So we went over there and that was pretty cool.  I mean, especially the fact that we had jobs again.  We were able to be creative and get back into the swing of things. 
[00:59:00]  And the cursing and talking about anything you want to talk about is really cool.  And that's what happened for 18 months.  And then Howard decided he was going to go to satellite.  I thought he invented satellite radio.  He did.  Well, if you listen to the pioneering spirit he has.  We were never acknowledged that we had been doing it for a year before, at least a year before.  And it was like, I'm revolutionizing everything, Robin.  I'm the king of everything. 
[00:59:30]  It didn't matter what happened.  You got the impression.  You were the rich little of the 21st century.  I try.  I really do try.  Every voice is a home run.  But he just went off about how he revolutionized.  People walk around like slugs, Robin.  I did the one foot in front of the other.  It's called walking.  Everyone does it now.  Everyone.  I'm ripping me off.  So we obviously were in satellite first.  He went. 
[01:00:00]  He's the pioneer.  All right.  We'll give him that one.  Whatever.  Have fun.  And then, well, David Lee Roth took over over here.  Thank you.  Uh-oh.  Thank you, David Lee Roth.  Thank you.  Diamond Dave.  Boozy, boozy.  Where did he go?  That didn't last too long.  And we kind of started knowing that something was up.  Right.  Like, we would have liked the job right out of the gate.  And we tried.  We tried to make this deal a while ago. 
[01:00:30]  There was a kick in the ass factor.  They weren't ready.  And even Stern knew about it because he'd be on his show going, those two idiots, Opie and  Anthony, they'd have had the world by the, you know, they would have known.  They would have had this seat.  They would have been here.  But they screwed up their careers.  And now, and we're sitting there going, you know, we got a great gig over at Satellite  and everything.  But, yeah, we were heirs to the throne.  This does suck, you know.  And they hired David Lee Roth.  And then we, you know, heard that that wasn't working out.  So we started going, hmm, I wonder if this is going to work out. 
[01:01:00]  And then to get to the two companies, CBS and XM, to actually work together is like Apollo  13, when they tried to get the CO2 thing to work from the command module to the lunar  module.  That's how CBS and XM, there were 20 adapters that had to be used between and lawyers and  agents and just like one person didn't get the other.  Two computers trying to talk.  It just didn't understand the language.  Right.  So one day we get a call from our agent and it's like, guys, it's going through. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, congrats.  Pop the champagne.  This is amazing.  I cannot believe this deal is happening.  The very next day, sometimes not even the day, later in the day, guys, it fell through.  This just will never happen.  It's, you know, we tried.  It's just and the ups and downs, you know, and then finally hammered out, got the deal  and then to walk in here and go, OK, how the hell this happened?  That is strange.  Now, had you ever been in this room prior to this?  No. 
[01:02:00]  Well, we took a couple tours.  We were up here one night when we weren't supposed to be.  Yeah.  A couple of nights.  Creeping around.  I think Big Kev described it appropriately as like being in Saddam's palace or something.  Yeah, that's what it is.  It's like it's like the Saddam when the army rolled in, kicked Saddam out and they're swimming  in the pool or.  That's a great way to look at it.  Or when Tony Montana got Frank's house.  Yeah.  That's another one.  Hey, Frank.  We know and we know it's driving him nuts.  It makes believe it's not and all that, but it's driving him nuts. 
[01:02:30]  I don't care.  And now he wants to make the same deal, but, you know, the little doggy company over there  is, you know, spending way too much money.  Now, when you pay a guy a half a billion dollars like that, the last thing you want him to do  is go somewhere else.  And give it away for free.  See, the good thing is we work cheap.  That's right.  So people don't care about selling us off like the whores we are.  That's right.  So you've exponentially increased the amount of listeners you guys have.  Oh, man.  Amazing.  Like you were on where?  In New York?  New York, Philly, Boston, Dallas. 
[01:03:00]  I'm looking at the list right now.  Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and West Palm Beach.  Pittsburgh.  For now.  For now.  More to be added.  More to be added.  More to be added.  And, you know, XM's great.  We love going over there.  And it keeps us from getting mad at the bosses here.  If we've got something we want to do that's going to be outrageous and be a problem, we  don't have to argue our point here.  We go, okay, we'll wait.  We'll do it over there.  We'll just do it over there.  So what happens at a certain point?  This show ends.  The CBS show ends.  At what time?  8.45, 8.50. 
[01:03:30]  And what's it go to then?  Just some music?  No.  Then we take the mics.  We have five minutes to get downstairs.  In the lobby, they give us handheld mics.  And then we broadcast the walk to XM.  We walk, talk to people on the street, screw around on the street.  We have Rich Voss, sometimes a comic.  And we have him just barge into a Starbucks, introduce him as a comic, and start doing like  this most heinous stand-up ever.  And the people are stunned that it's happening.  The employees don't know to kick him out yet, because it's one of those things that 
[01:04:00]  had like a bombing that just happened, literally, with Voss sometimes, that just happens, and  people are shocked.  They're like, what is going on here?  Because Kenny gives the big intro, and now, ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage,  and people are like, I'm having my coffee.  What the hell is this?  I talk to homeless people on the street, and then we go back to the XM studio and broadcast  from there.  We would have liked to have broadcast from one studio.  But that was part of the deal, that the computers talking to each other didn't get. 
[01:04:30]  They want us here.  But something good created comes out of it, because you can walk over.  Yeah, the walk is becoming the best.  And the atmosphere is so much different that it keeps us, I think, in here, we know where  we are.  Right.  We got to talk like, you know, we're at grandma's house.  Right, right.  And over there, we...  Like you have to think three feet ahead of each statement.  It's a little tough.  Yeah, yeah.  When I sat down, I was just like, can't curse, must not curse.  I know, you're so used to it.  We're used to it.  And then when we get over there, the second we get on the street, it's nothing but F,  S.  You know, we're just throwing them out like crazy. 
[01:05:00]  By the way, you can curse here.  You got the delay.  Yeah.  Yeah, they got the dump.  Ah, fuck it.  See?  Now that's going to be dumped, and we're going to have a problem.  Let's see.  I'm just showing Kevin that we can curse here.  Yeah, but you're being very bold.  They should have a TV that has the dump guy, so you can look to see if he's taking a whiz  or something.  Yeah, to make sure he's not dozing off or going for coffee.  Sitting there reading a comic book.  Oh, it seems like everything's under control.  I'll walk down the hall and get myself a cup of coffee.  We got Kevin in there.  Kevin isn't really known for... 
[01:05:30]  Kevin's not going to curse.  He's not going to have a normal interview.  They're going to talk about movies.  I'm going to go get some food.  Bro, this is the easiest job in the world.  Right.  What did he say?  Oh.  He hears it from the bathroom.  All right.  So the show on CBS ends at 8.45?  Yeah, 8.45, 8.50.  We try to push it.  But normally, the morning drive time shows used to go to 10 a.m. or something like that?  And what was the idea there?  Just like, really, drive time ends by 9 o'clock?  I thought that was weird.  No.  Well, the only...  Most people are at work.  See, when it comes down, the only way XM wanted this deal was if we did exclusive material 
[01:06:00]  for them.  Right.  So they need a couple of hours.  So they need a couple of hours.  And there's only so much radio we could do in a day.  Right now, we're committed to do five hours a day.  Right.  Sometimes we do six.  Sometimes we do six, you know, if we're feeling it.  But that's why.  But if, you know, CBS went to them and said we want them to do six to 10, XM was going,  hey, excuse me.  Right.  We'd like a little piece of them here, you know.  We brought them back.  Money talks.  Money talks.  You watch. 
[01:06:30]  And XM is probably happy because you guys are here and it means more people will listen  to the show and they'll be like, hey, I'm going to pick up the XM or something.  Yeah, we get to promote XM, too, which is...  Without paying.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, because the people that listen to us until 9 o'clock, they might want to hear what  we're going to say from 9 to 11 or 12 o'clock on Censored.  It's a business deal, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They kind of...  We like it a lot.  We like it.  It is something that hasn't been done before.  A lot of people go from terrestrial radio and simulcast on satellite. 
[01:07:00]  They do things like that.  But to have two shows with like a continuity thread through it.  Right.  But they're almost two different shows like this.  We're pioneers.  We got to take a break.  We're a little late.  Yep.  Kevin Smith in studio.  We'll talk about Clerks 2 and also other movies.  And we got to get into this Bonds thing.  This Bonds thing is making us laugh hard this morning.  They didn't get the call.  They didn't get the call when he hit 715.  I think it was out of spite.  Someone...  I don't know. 
[01:07:30]  We got the clip.  It's really funny to listen to.  But the local radio there in San Francisco did not get the call when he hit the big home run there.  So we'll get into that next and other things.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony show.  Most of us get here on time.  We're just fat guys on the air.  We are so pathetic.  We're fancy, fancy people.  It's the battle of the mental illness.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down syndrome children.  It's showtime, folks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:08:00]  You'll love us.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We love just yapping during the commercials.  Sometimes the mics go on and we're still talking.  We got a full studio today.  We got Kevin Smith.  Clerks 2 coming out in July.  He's getting standing ovations already. 
[01:08:30]  Already.  But they were French people, so.  But they were French people.  Let's qualify it.  Good point.  Did they really mock the Da Vinci Code?  I don't know.  Did they poo-poo it?  But most of the pooing came from the critical community.  Yeah.  However, they screened that movie, Marie Antoinette, Sophia Coppola movie.  Yeah.  And they were quoted as saying they were in the press screening, there were Gaelic boos, which  I guess is supposed to mean French. 
[01:09:00]  Gaelic boos.  How can you discern a boo, an American boo from French?  From a Gaelic boo.  Boo.  Gaelic was an Irish boo.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  Gaelic?  Isn't Gaelic Irish?  A Celtic boo.  A Celtic boo.  And of course, the voice of Jay Moore, everyone.  Yes, Jay.  Back in our studios.  Can I give props to Jay for a second?  Of course.  Back when we were doing the casting for Jay and Silent Bob Shrek back, and I met with  Jay, and I wrote about meeting with Jay, because I thought he was a very cool guy.  We had nothing for him in the movie, because he's far too talented for my crap. 
[01:09:30]  Didn't have this at the time.  Exactly.  I didn't expect this.  Look at my little smile.  Jay was one of the funniest people I've ever sat down with.  You dropped that line, which I still quote to this day, and tell people is my own, where  you said it's like a retard.  You were describing some person's reaction, and you're like, it's like a retarded child  looking at a Ferris wheel, just laughing every time.  Ah, yeah.  But I probably just stole it off Bob Kelly, if you read Whack Bag.  Don't read the message boards. 
[01:10:00]  But he was giving you guys props then.  That was like 2000, and he was talking about being on the show.  It's Opie and Anthony, Kevin.  Joe's, uh...  In case you're like, you guys...  Because you know when you make the rounds, you're on like, rape kit and crawl space in  the morning.  And you get down to town.  I realize, like, as I'm saying it to Kevin, he just paid me, like, the sweetest compliment.  I'm like, it's Opie and Anthony, Kevin.  You know, in case you forgot their names.  Because God forbid...  Rape kit and crawl space.  God forbid I take a compliment. 
[01:10:30]  In the morning.  I figure most people listening know what show we're on, but you're right.  I guess we should have spoiled that.  I so want to be that now.  I want to be rape kit and crawl space.  Wait, we're going to do promos and everything now.  You're welcome, sir.  Rape kit and crawl space.  Morning.  Hey, how you doing there, rape kit?  Guys.  Wacky show.  Oh, guys.  Yeah, and the hole has to be there.  Have you played the hole for Kevin?  Yeah.  Uh, no.  I don't know what happened.  We don't have a woman on the show.  We've been told by XM, like at the beginning, when they actually thought they could tell us 
[01:11:00]  stuff, that we should have a woman on the show.  Well, everybody has told us that over the years.  Yeah, over the years, for some reason, Opie and Anthony balances it out.  That way it's not so offensive to, ugh.  So we listen to all these women on other radio shows and go, why would we possibly, why would  we want that on our show?  It's tokenism.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  So now we just have this on the soundboard. 
[01:11:30]  So now whenever anything is said, oh, boy, Opie, sometimes you're such a faggot.  Stop it.  All right.  Come on.  Stop.  Okay.  Now, now.  Hold on.  That's all you need.  Perfect hole.  That's a, yes.  Boo.  Rachel.  Boo.  You've come back.  Be good to her.  Boo.  Be good to her. 
[01:12:00]  Now play Sandy Kane getting a thumb.  A woman's whole job on radio is to ruin anything fun.  Yeah, anything fun.  What do you mean on radio?  Are you right?  Sandy Kane.  She does a public access TV show.  She's an old vaudevillian stripper.  I don't play it.  That's the only way I can describe her.  There's no way Kevin hasn't seen her.  She's like a hundred. 
[01:12:30]  Like if Joan Rivers had large breasts and was a stripper, and she has a, I know, run free,  right?  Yeah.  So Joan Rivers without the plastic surgery.  And she puts, like, those little, like, those eyes that wiggle that are on, like, little  people.  Yeah, on her toy.  On the, and she's like, this is my friend, Mr. Toy.  But at least I'm cool.  And she's, like, super cheap.  And she turns it on, and as it vibrates, she puts it down on the desk, and it walks around  on its own.  And the thing is walking. 
[01:13:00]  I ain't got no body.  No, I'm just kidding.  It smells like a star kiss can.  Oh, ow.  Yeah, she's quite the catch.  We gotta have her back on.  Although she's a little unruly as far as her language goes.  Nah, we'll have her back.  I don't know where she's been.  Uh-oh.  And then she's got this thing.  She's not dead.  Then she's got the thing growing out of her.  The thing.  The thing that looks like an ear.  Did you go, like, you went to con?  I did. 
[01:13:30]  I went to cancer.  That's the con.  Is it con, or I just thought it was goofy to say con?  I think it's either word.  I believe it's can, but a lot of people say con.  Plus, sure, as you guys will say can.  Some people go one step further and say cons.  I love Jimmy Can.  I had the S at the end.  Jimmy Can.  The world's greatest also ran.  That was for you, not for me.  Oh, I know.  Okay, good.  I'm the first one that crashes myself.  Yeah, he definitely crashes himself.  Believe me, I crash myself.  I know when I lay an egg. 
[01:14:00]  What's the name of the blonde guy, Jay, in Jay and Silent Bob?  Jason Mewes.  Oh, my God.  Like, I'm helpless.  He's funny.  Like, I'm helpless when I watch the movie.  He's funny.  He just celebrated his third sober birthday, finally.  Oh, God.  He was really, really in a bad way.  However, he pissed me off fairly recently, because he was supposed to come over for the  screening.  I'm available.  I just got divorced.  I have $46 in a house.  Jay, parentheses, Moore, and Silent Bob.  Let's do Fletch, man.  Yes.  That was the rumor for, like, five years. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  He was making Fletch with me.  Nice.  I'm like, I probably would have heard about it.  Probably would have gotten a call.  How come all of a sudden I start talking about, like, Colin, when I told you about Fletch?  I told you, like, shut up, stupid.  You're not that magnanimous.  Anything you could talk about and piss you off?  About Mewes?  Yeah.  He was supposed to come to Cannes, and he got to the airport, and I guess they were  going to stick him in coach.  Oh, well, what's wrong with that?  Either that or search him. 
[01:15:00]  Claustrophobic.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Because I guess when he was a kid, when his mom was a pretty bad junkie, and she used  to, like, drop him off at strangers' houses.  And beat him with a plane.  Wow.  They'd stick him in a closet for, like, hours at a time.  So he gets pretty claustrophobic.  They'd only beat him in a club seat, not a big leather one.  Free drinks.  So he opted against being beat with a plane.  Here's my ears, Jimmy.  This is my new impression.  This is Luke Costello.  You say, what, she beat him with a plane?  What, she beat him with a plane?  I beat him with a plane.  But I gotta, you know what? 
[01:15:30]  If they'd bump me to coach to go across the Atlantic, I'd take a cab home.  That's what I said.  I'd coach it right to home.  That's a long flight.  It's seven hours now.  Sitting coach.  That's long at first.  Especially if you're Jason.  You know, he's going to get bothered by everybody.  And seven hours in that tight seat.  All that claustrophobic.  All that booze flowing.  Yeah.  Everyone around you drinking and you can't.  I kind of get it.  But at the same time, it's like, oh, dude, take the hit. 
[01:16:00]  Take the hit.  Because he could have been there for the standing ovation.  Eight minutes, right?  An eight-minute standing ovation?  I love first-class thoughts.  Eight minutes at, like, 2.30 in the morning.  So we were pretty damn happy.  Hey, Bobby's here.  Hey, there he is.  This is Bobby.  All right.  Wait, what mic is that?  Don't spoil it.  Maybe one of these, go.  Hey.  What's up, Bobby?  Jay Moore.  You know Jay, right?  Hey, Jay, how are you?  Hi, Bobby.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  What's going on?  Would you come over from the other station?  Yeah, I was over there helping out.  Helping out, huh?  Why are you wearing a Ron at Fez shirt?  You work for Opie and Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Well, I started out with Ron at Fez and, you know, my loyalty.  The loyalty lies with them.  And they could have you, by the way.  You're over here now.  I'm gay, gay, gay, gay.  You're over here now.  Hey, why are you wearing a shirt?  Hey, jackass.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, those guys going to be selling hot dogs on the side of the road?  In the desert?  Yeah, we're selling hot dogs, jackass.  That's right.  Pick up a dog on the way to Vegas. 
[01:17:00]  A little battle with dice now, by the way.  Really?  Yeah, he went on.  We don't even know what we did.  We have no idea what we did to him, but now he hates us.  Now he hates us.  I called him a heeb, and then I was on the Google search.  I do it.  You know when you get baked, and you just sit around your house, and you Google search your  own name, and you're like, I wonder what the 40th page is.  You know what I mean?  And one was a picture of me on the cover of a Jewish magazine with a Hitler mustache.  Oh, nice.  It all came from me calling him a heeb-naughton. 
[01:17:30]  I swear to God.  And it was like the Jewish something time.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  And the prize, not too pricey.  It's cheap.  Good food, plenty of it.  Maybe like Jay Moore, the next Hitler.  So all I know is Jay Moore.  I swear to God.  That's what it said.  On page like 85 of the Google.  Like I'm not important.  You dye your hair black, give a little sweep in the front, a little mustache.  I think you look good.  Prussian blue. 
[01:18:00]  So we got Bobby in studio there, Jay.  All right.  Well, just hang around, Bobby.  We're going to need you later.  Okay.  I don't know what that's about.  I'm waiting for you.  All right.  Ew.  What are you going to...  That was like the creepiest thing I've ever heard.  Let's go to Nick in Oregon.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to say that I saw the trailer to Clerks 2 and it looks great, man.  And it was what?  And it was great.  It looks great.  It looks great, man.  That's how they say it in Oregon.  It looks great, man.  Oregon?  You guys aren't...  Oh, that's...  Oregon almost...  How's that word? 
[01:18:30]  It's not a state anymore.  Is he still there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys were like in the worst state of any state.  What do you say to that, man?  No, but you have some, like, miraculous governor that...  Ah, it's still being an anti-show.  Hang off.  Leave me alone.  All right.  You're in the worst state of all...  No, I was.  According to Jay.  Of all states.  It was like an economically, like, just dispensable place.  And then some governor came in. 
[01:19:00]  And fixed it.  You like...  Could you do me the honors?  Well, does the caller have any more comments, sir?  Any more charismatic remarks?  Could I have the car crash for just...  Oh.  Do me the honors?  No, it was the best date of all the states.  Now.  Yeah.  Since the governor.  Murmur.  So Nick likes the trailer for Clerks 2.  And they loved it over there.  They gave you an eight-minute standing ovation.  Yes.  So, so far, so good.  So far, so good.  All right.  Let's see.  What was the budget for Clerks 2?  Five million.  Wow.  What was the budget for Clerks 1? 
[01:19:30]  Like $10,000.  $27,570,000.  Yeah, $27,000.  And you just maxed out the credit cards?  Yeah.  It's amazing.  It worked.  It worked.  Got me here.  How cool is that?  Got you here.  Got you vans with no socks.  Exactly.  That movie is still goddamn funny.  Thank you.  Are we going to talk about Barry Bonds?  I need to learn about baseball.  Yeah, we could do that.  You heard what happened with the Barry Bonds call there, Jay?  The local radio guy didn't get it?  Oops.  But nobody knows what happened.  Yeah.  What happened?  You got to think someone pulled the plug. 
[01:20:00]  Come on.  I don't know.  Do you really think so?  Barry is hated.  Like, he's just hated.  No one wanted to see him break that record.  And the announcement is supposed to be there.  It's a historic event.  That would have gone into, like, the Broadcasting Museum.  It would have went to Cooperstown.  Yeah, Cooperstown, where you put the headphones on and you get to hear it.  Now, wait a second.  Dial it back for the idiots, those of us who have no idea what you're talking about.  Well, what happened?  Why, in particular, were you the one that wanted to talk about it? 
[01:20:30]  Because I like to come here and learn things.  He likes to interview us.  It's like school.  He likes to turn it around a little bit.  No, I mean, you know, Barry Bonds hit 7-15.  We'll get to that.  And the guy sits on, like, deep center field, and then the broadcast went out.  Cricket, cricket.  So they never got the home run call.  You just heard big ant.  Well, here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here's the actual call.  Three and two. 
[01:21:00]  Finley runs.  The payoff pitch is swinging a drive.  Deep center.  I think we have lost Dave's microphone.  Barry Bonds has just hit a 715 career home run.  Out over the world in right center field, a titanic blast.  Oh, boy.  I'm like, my heart's racing.  Deep tip.  Someone is so fired.  Deep tip. 
[01:21:30]  I'm Bob Murphy.  This was that guy's moment.  Bob Murphy.  That would a high towering high fly ball be.  Hey, Bob.  How about I buy you fly?  That would be fantastic, but I believe that one would.  I, uh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Isn't that unbelievable?  I didn't hear it.  Ladies and gentlemen, as the Hindenburg comes into Lakehurst, New Jersey, it's, oh, Mike.  That's pretty much it. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  That is pretty much it.  It could have been history.  That guy's name would have been known to everybody, Cooperstown.  Then the other guy just picked up another microphone to at least, you know, finish the call somehow.  Yeah, crappy Mike.  At least tell him what happened.  If you listen, you hear, move over, stupid.  Your mic's off, ass.  Watch out, Gordon.  Tranquility base, the eagle.  Why?  What about the eagle?  You and the eagle.  How about me driving around Huntington Beach, stoned out of my head, and you're going, you're 
[01:22:30]  explaining how he made a mistake when he landed on the moon because you said one small step  for man means mankind.  Yeah.  One small step for man.  It's supposed to be one small step for a man.  You meant landing on the moon when you said eagle, correct?  Yeah.  All right.  One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  For mankind.  And you're like, and you made it.  It's a big mistake.  It's supposed to be a man.  Man is mankind.  Right.  Yeah.  And I'm in my driveway for like a half hour waiting to see how this plays out. 
[01:23:00]  Like, wait a minute.  Man is mankind?  Yeah.  And he said he said it, but he didn't.  He's just like, he should have said one small step for a man.  Right.  Yeah.  One giant leap for mankind.  The stoners love this show at times.  Yeah.  When we start discussing things like that.  But dude, he is man.  Yeah.  If I was stoned and I listened to Ben snoring, I wouldn't be alive today.  Though he was the only guy there at the time on the actual surface of the moon.  So man is.  Allegedly man. 
[01:23:30]  Allegedly man.  It was a sound stage.  It was a sound stage.  Disney did the whole thing on film and then was given land in Florida, which is now Disney  world.  Dude, why was the flag blowing in the wind?  There's no wind on the moon.  The shadows aren't the right way.  Man.  Man.  What was me Harvey Oswald doing there, man?  Right.  You can tell that the towers came down on the moon because they fell so slowly.  Man.  Have you spoken to 9-11 conspiracy? 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  We had a talk with one guy.  It's just, it's so ridiculous.  I don't know if I could control my anger.  Dude, you want to show, if he was here live, he would have been punched.  But he's on the phone.  Who was it?  That's my boy.  And he's a kid.  He's like.  What was the guy that did that loose chain?  Oh, yeah.  He's 22 and he wears a 9-11 investigation shirt, you know, just to kind of marry himself  to the tragedy.  It's all.  The story behind that dude is like, I guess it was Tony Soprano, the dude who plays Tony  Soprano, told him that like, you got to, if you want to make a, you want, a kid wanted 
[01:24:30]  to be a filmmaker.  This is what I read online about him.  He said, yeah, he wanted to be a filmmaker.  He said, if you want to be a filmmaker, you got to make some kind of bold statement.  So the dude started thinking about, what if I made a fiction film about a September 11  conspiracy theory, like, you know, that the government was really behind it.  And he maintains that in the course of his investigation, like doing some background  work, he uncovered a bunch of facts that didn't go together.  And suddenly he went from making a fiction film to a documentary film.  And it became this thing, Loose Change, which you can download on like Google Video.  It's like an hour and a half long. 
[01:25:00]  But his facts are not facts.  He spits them out so quickly.  You're sitting there going, for the first five minutes watching it, you're going, oh my  God, he's right.  Is that true?  And then you're like, wait a second, let me check anyone.  Yeah, it takes five seconds to do some research.  There's like a hole in the Pentagon wall that is so small.  And it's like, you mean to tell me that 757 hitting the Pentagon left a hole this big?  And right next to it, it says punch out in spray paint.  It was a place where the firemen actually made that hole as a smoke punch out that they 
[01:25:30]  make in buildings.  It wasn't done by the plane.  They did find plane parts.  Why were no plane parts found at the Pentagon?  They certainly did, but the landing is an engine part.  There's a perfect example of that, though.  He talks about like a plane, any plane that was coming in that low, if since I guess there's  a major thoroughfare there, would have blown the cars away because the jet engine blast.  And you sit there going, that makes sense.  I guess he's right.  It was a conspiracy.  Yeah.  Then when you're at an airport and you're taking off on a plane and you look on the 
[01:26:00]  tarmac and there are cars driving around and their cars are being blown off the tarmac,  maybe that dude's wrong.  Why aren't they being blown off?  And you're saying the one plane landed in Cleveland and dropped people in a hangar.  He's just a...  Oh, in a hangar.  They all got off like Dreyfuss out of that van.  Right.  Sunglasses and red suits.  This is not a moon burn.  Kevin, I don't think I noticed that you actually moved your hands when you said driving around.  Thank you.  Timing for the radio.  All right, look, we got to take another break, okay? 
[01:26:30]  Take a minute.  Kevin Smith in studio.  Clerks 2 opens July what?  The 21st.  July 21st.  Oh, let's make it the real...  Let's take America back.  Put Clerks at the top of the heap, man.  All these garbage movies.  Yeah.  Now finally we get what we've been waiting for.  Number one at the box office.  I'm not going to argue that.  And of course, Jay Moore in studio.  Are we promoting anything, Jay?  Or are you just hanging?  What are you doing?  I'm broke.  Did you really just get divorced?  Can we get into the divorce next a little bit?  Amanda, Amanda.  All right, all right.  Get me started. 
[01:27:00]  For what?  Well, just so I can hear you.  I'll commiserate.  Did you buy out or are you on the payment?  Do you have a business partner for a while?  I had a buy out, but I bought out over time.  It doesn't end for like 2009, my friend.  I bought out all at once.  Like I handed the valise across the table and I left in a leased car with $46 and a home.  Wow.  Do you know what insult it is?  I'm doing Tuesdays at the Irvine Improv for the entire month of June.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's not a joke.  And that's not a plug, F-A-G's.  Do you know?  Sorry, I don't run. 
[01:27:30]  Do you know what an insult it is that my ex-wife's lawyer was none other than Dominic Barbara, friend of Howard?  Another reason why there's so much hate.  And I had to listen to, because of your success, I believe the two of you should share in what was made during success.  The success came at the tail end of the marriage, Pally.  How about the times I was knocking tin?  I was in an attic.  I don't think she'd want part of my $29,500 a year I was making. 
[01:28:00]  Why are you so angry at me?  Knocking tin, a euphemism for what?  For air conditioning and heating.  I thought it was like...  That's what they call tin knocker.  How about the times I was in the attic masturbating?  Well, that's what I was knocking boots to mint condition, yo.  That happened, too.  Yeah, oh, just the anger.  Maybe I shouldn't bring this up, but she also got a raise recently.  Yeah, well, whenever we get one, you know, she gets one.  It works out that way.  Jim Brooks' wife got millions because he stood in the way of her flight attendant career. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The simple solution to all this is never get divorced.  Or murdered.  Yeah, but sometimes you've got to.  When you have a kid, murder's no good.  Sometimes you have to.  You have to.  I don't know if it could ever get that bad.  You know something?  God bless you.  Because if it doesn't get that bad for you, then perfect.  Stay married.  Love each other.  It's a beautiful thing.  For me, that wasn't it.  Right.  I was so not in love.  I would actually bring my girlfriend home and go, here's my girlfriend. 
[01:29:00]  I'm with her.  Can you please leave?  It was just that bad.  And it's funny that she wanted so much money after that.  Look, I understand the scorn.  I understand the scorn.  But then there was, you know, you got lawyers going, you know, saying that people are responsible for certain aspects of your career.  And, you know, I was funny at five years old, making my family cry at family functions because they're laughing so hard. 
[01:29:30]  You know, that didn't come from, you know, getting married.  Right.  You know, and then him coming up with my future earnings, which a couple of years later, at most, turned into zero.  You know, it's like I got fired.  It's a radio.  It's not like I could, you know, move on to something else if you screw up badly enough.  So it was one of those positions I was in where it was like, oh.  You, potential earnings, Anthony, your goes into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
[01:30:00]  What?  You're like, I'm going to be rich.  Now, you could pay her, you know, $50 million.  Have you checked, like, a bank account?  I had $40,000 in it.  She took it out.  That's one of my favorite stories of all time.  I have not.  When I went to the bank with Opie.  I was trying to help you out.  Yeah, we saw things were really turning bad, like a lawyer was being hired and everything.  So we figured, you know.  Wait, when is this?  This is back in 99.  Okay.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, 99.  So we figured, you know, things are getting bad. 
[01:30:30]  Look, I got $40,000 in the bank.  It's everything I've ever earned in my life.  And believe me, it was new money.  Right.  Because during my whole life, if I had $500 in my bank, if I had $500, it was a lot of money.  Yeah, you had major debt.  So I was, like, paying off credit cards and stuff.  And I amassed $40,000 in the bank that I was very proud of.  So I figured I'd go down to the bank because things were getting bad.  She was getting a lawyer.  I heard horror stories.  Go with Opie.  I go, you know something?  I'm going down to the bank right down here.  I'm going to take $20,000 out.  Well, at least that'll leave her time. 
[01:31:00]  Swear to God.  Kevin, he goes, I will take half.  I will leave half for her.  So I go down there.  I write out my withdrawal slip for $20,000.  I hand it to the guy.  And the guy's like, oh, Mr. Kumia, could you sit over there and talk with Mr., whatever his name is, the head muckety-muck at the bank?  The guy sits there.  He goes, you have a withdrawal for $20,000.  Your balance is $48.62, Mr. Kumia.  I go, what happened to the money?  I go, let me look.  It was withdrawn by Ms. Jennifer Kumia yesterday at... 
[01:31:30]  She beat him by like 12 hours.  The whole wad, Tim.  Did she leave $48 just to be a jackass?  I think you had to leave something or that your account was closed or something.  At that point, do you only want to take $24 and be a good guy?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, let me be a good guy.  No, I walked out of there like in shock.  Opie had to actually like carry me out, walk my hand this way.  Watch the cars, Anthony.  No, no.  I had $40,000 large.  No, no.  It was in there. 
[01:32:00]  You know what it was?  It will go old school here.  You had like a Dr. Bellows thing happen in there.  You were just like...  It was Major Nelson.  $40,000.  $40,000.  But when it was in there.  And then...  But she came and I looked and...  But it was...  But Major Nelson.  She was here.  But then...  Oh, I need...  That's how I was.  I had the 40,000...  40, jeez to me.  A lot of money.  It took me...  Yeah, right?  It took me $40,000 large.  If somebody takes it, it will always be a lot of money. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, it's a lot of money.  I don't care if you've got millions.  Somebody takes $40,000.  And then you're done with that, right?  And you go to court.  And now like you're trying to get at least half of that back.  And they're telling you...  They're telling you no.  No.  What you need to do is pay more.  Right.  Well, they tell you we start from here.  What?  Yeah.  Today is a new day.  So we start fresh now.  We start fresh from here on in.  And she got at me because one day I went to my house, my old house that I was told not  to go to, and broke the back window and climbed in and got my computer equipment and anything 
[01:33:00]  else I need in there.  Nerd.  And I got a call.  Nerd.  I got a call.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you say that.  Yeah.  Showing how nice of a guy he is.  What do you do after you broke the window?  Well, I love the little kitty cats we had and I didn't want them cutting themselves.  So I swept up and I put the glass in the garbage and I put wood over where I broke in to make  sure they didn't get out.  A little note.  And I got this.  You know, you could have just fucking come over and asked and I would have given you 
[01:33:30]  that.  Oh, like the 40 grand?  Yeah.  So I had to break in and get my stuff.  And I didn't know.  Does that get brought up in the divorce procedure?  Yeah.  It kind of got brought up, but nothing big of it.  And it turned out that she had been gone that weekend.  Thank God.  Because I was running around like at that point I felt like a criminal.  The door was open.  My truck was on the front lawn, like backed up to the front door and I'm heaving stuff  like looking, waiting, not knowing she was out of town for like the whole weekend. 
[01:34:00]  I could have slept there, but I'm throwing stuff.  I'm running.  I'm grabbing everything I could.  Computers and some clothing.  And then I asked her, I go, what happened to my clothes?  Listen to this.  Oh, those?  You won't see those no more.  It was like Carlo.  Yeah.  Or the other guy.  What happened to Paulie?  Paulie, you won't see him no more.  Oh, your clothes?  Took him to the Salvation Army.  Everything? 
[01:34:30]  Like I didn't have good clothes or anything, but there was some things like my WAAF jacket  that I kind of liked as a thing.  And he just walking around, my concert t-shirts, just walking around Huntington seeing some  homeless guy in my clothing.  I went to Mark Parenteau's house, and all I got was this lousy t-shirt and something else  I'll say two hours from now.  All right, look, we're really late.  We're really, really late.  All right, we got Kevin Smith, Clerks 2, and Jay Moore, who's just broke.  We'll get into that a little bit later on, okay?  I got nothing!

Smoke a butt.  He's got a vice.  I don't know if it was a commercial because he talks about it a lot of things.  I'll be here.  What's that, Jay?  Jesus.  Jay was talking into mid-air.  Well, Jay was doing some catching up during the break. 
[01:36:00]  And he goes to Nathaniel and he goes,  Hey, how did that commercial work out for you?  First of all, he couldn't believe I remembered it.  Yeah.  I don't know my mom's birthday.  I remember the C-3PO John Olerud look-alike.  C-3PO.  That weirdo.  Master Luke.  Remember how hard we went through that, Jimmy?  Remember the good times we had?  Smashing, didn't we?  Oh, great.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then he's like,  Oh, it didn't go over well that we read the copy over the air.  And it's only like the Avis campaign that has brought Avis up in the boots. 
[01:36:30]  Like the greatest campaign.  Yeah.  With like the play DMX and it's white guys like eyeballing each other.  And it's all the time.  You see it on TV all the time.  And he was supposed to be up for that role.  Yeah.  Well, he makes it seem like, you know, the agent had an offer in.  And they're like, look, we need fan.  And as soon as that happened, they're like, look, we can't use fan.  Get me fan.  Get me then.  Mr. Fabersham.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He lost that spot.  And he doesn't want to talk about it.  Look, he's giving us that thumbs up from the other room.

[01:38:00]  Is this the first radio show you're calling into?  You guys are the only radio show I love.  Of course, it's the first show I'm calling into.  It's Jason Itzer.  That's how you say your last name, right, Jason?  Uh, Itzler.  Itzler, I'm sorry.  Itzler, and he used to run New York Confidential.  Right.  Or NY Confidential.  Right, which was the number one rated escort agency in America.  Yes.  Out of 5,000 escort agencies and 75,000 escorts.  Guy still plugs it like a champ, man.  Huh?  Oh, you rock, man.  He's in Rikers. 
[01:38:30]  You've been there for...  And now he's sitting on black eyes, laughs, bragging.  You've been in Rikers for over a year now?  I've been on Rikers for 18 months.  18 months.  We've been on satellite for 18 months.  Yeah, well, I was excited when I saw that you guys were going to be on live radio also.  That's when I knew I could call in.  That happened about two weeks ago, right?  About a month ago.  I got to tell you, Jason, we felt a little guilt because Jason was and still is a huge fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  And he started promoting NY Confidential on our program. 
[01:39:00]  Matter of fact, our own little Jimmy Norton had some...  He offered Jason was a good egg, and he offered us each to come down for sessions.  And before he finished the offer, I was knocking on the front door.  Right.  And he hooked me up with his number one girl.  Natalia.  Which was fantastic.  Natalia came in and just very good, very good girl.  And Jimmy took some liberties with her.  I bet I did.  And if you remember, he got sick afterwards. 
[01:39:30]  He had a cold, a bad cold.  And we had joked because he had done certain things that in some states are considered...  Sorry, Jason.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Hey, you know, is that your theme song that you guys have at the beginning? 
[01:40:00]  You just missed...  Hold on, Jason.  Hold on.  We're going to get right back to you in a second.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We have Jay Moore in studio.  And, oh, my God, I'm laughing so hard.  I literally just puked up some egg whites, and I'm crying.  Jay Moore was...  He was doing the show with us, and he just disappeared.  We're like, all right, maybe he needs to...  I don't know, go to the bathroom or something.  He goes into the dunking booth.  He goes into the dunking booth.  Kevin, did you get to see that?  No.  You missed Jay Moore completely naked.  He's still out of shape.  You missed that, are you? 
[01:40:30]  I was just out of dunking.  So I'm trying to impress the most...  So Jay Moore goes into the dunking booth.  By the way, we've...  You know, we call that the dunking booth in honor of Jay Moore.  Jay Moore came up with that.  And he comes running out of the dunking booth completely naked, and how are we going to say  this so it doesn't get dumped out?  Jay Moore jumped on our buddy here.  Bobby.  Bobby, Bobby, the intern's neck.  Yeah.  And put...  He rode his neck nude.  Yeah.  He put his legs just about over his shoulders and rode the back of his neck and his hat. 
[01:41:00]  I broke his hat.  His hat flew off because Jay's area was right up against his neck as he was facing.  Do you want to hug again?  Wait, did you have the video camera running?  Are you...  No, I told him.  I told him that.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  He's been taking me now.  He can't be naked.  No.  Easy, pal.  Take a back seat, would you?  You missed a good one.  Wow.  Was that really bad?  But he said no homo.  Yes.  Hey, Jim.  You guys think you got me back?  The guy who was in Jerry Maguire just put his junk on my back. 
[01:41:30]  So, like, I'm kind of famous right now.  Jim, can we put...  Wow, you're the gayest guy in the room.  Can we say my web address?  Oh, yes.  Hold on, Jason.  We're getting back to you in a second.  That was just a huge laugh.  And then, Jason, how long are you allowed to be on the phone at Rikers?  I got 15 minutes.  Probably about seven minutes left.  Seven more minutes.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  This is funnier.  Yeah.  So, Jay, depressing.  You ran an escort agency and you set up cameras and, you know, bragged about it and you got popped.  Everything's going to work out for the best. 
[01:42:00]  If you go to jasonitzler.com, J-A-S-O-N.  If you said that 17 months and 29 days ago, I'd say, yeah.  Hold on.  Jason, I-T-Z-L-E-R.com.  Yeah.  You can see my picture.  Right.  What I did was I allowed a reality show to be shot while I was running my agency.  He's a genius.  Because Mel Sachs, who was my attorney at the time, told me that I was running a perfectly legal business the entire time that I was running it.  Really?  Mel must have been in my place 40 to 50 hours a week the entire time I was open. 
[01:42:30]  So, you just threw him under a bus.  Johnny Walker blew with me, telling me that I was perfectly, perfectly safe, not breaking the law at all.  Jason, how long are you in for?  I'll be in for another three or four months and I'm done.  Three or four months, then you're done.  And I've come up with the best fucking idea of my life.  All right.  Hold on.  You're cursed.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're cursed.  Yeah, we're not on the satellite.  All right.  Jason curse.  Go ahead, Jason.  Okay.  I've come up with the best gosh darn idea of my life where I'm going to have girls 10 times prettier than I had before and I had Ford models working for me before. 
[01:43:00]  And I'm going to have gentlemen much richer, classier, and more famous than I ever had before.  And I had many billionaires before.  How do you not love this guy?  How do you not love this guy?  I am so fucking, I am so damn excited to get out of jail and start my new businesses.  I'm going to make, I'll make my first several million dollars within six or four months.  Now, let me, let me ask you something.  How's your butt?  You get, you get out of prison and you, you start up this whole thing.  Aren't they going to be keeping an eye on you?  Yeah, I'm going to do something 100% legal. 
[01:43:30]  I'm sorry.  100% legal with women involved and you're going to make a lot of money.  How, how does that work?  I can't, well, the most brilliant people come up with the simplest ideas and I have the  simplest idea that'll make me millions, will make people happier than I've ever made them  before.  Wow, that's hard to do.  And as soon as I get the patents done and the copywriting, et cetera, I'd be glad to reveal  it on your show.  Also, you know, you guys much more love.  Wow, I can't believe neither me or Kevin are talking right now.  I love Richard Johnson at Page Six.  You guys much love Richard Johnson at Page Six also. 
[01:44:00]  We don't like him, but.  Nah, he's an ass.  We think he's a tool.  He really is a tool.  I met him in person.  He's a great guy.  He looks like Superman.  He's six foot two.  You're black.  You're giving shout outs from jail.  You're a black man.  He kicked ass.  Yeah, I want to give it out to Page Six.  Richard Johnson is the number one publicist in the world by far.  He's trying to get on.  He talks about me every now and then.  He's trying to get on, you know, in Page Six, but the problem is Richard Johnson hates  us, so he's never going to print anything we do.  Yeah, but you'll turn it over and he'll love you guys.  They do.  What's the worst thing that happened to you so far in Rikers? 
[01:44:30]  The worst thing that happened to me in Rikers?  Yeah.  Um, I guess my relationship with Natalia kind of went to hell.  No, we mean in Rikers, you know, with the people, the convicts.  In you.  Did they beat you up?  What's the worst thing that happened to in you?  That night, that was a guy that challenged me to a fight, and when I went up to fight  him, he ran away from me.  He was going to court at four in the morning.  He came over to my bed and punched me in the eye twice before he went to court.  He was a child rapist, and they let him go because the person didn't show up to court 
[01:45:00]  for him.  If I were you, I would have reported him to the guard.  That's what you do in jail.  You immediately go to the guard.  You go, that man struck me.  Yeah.  They respect that.  You're not really supposed to do that.  Why was a child molester in GP?  What's that?  Why was a child molester in GP?  I'm not in general population.  I'm in protective custody.  Why?  You're in with child molesters for running an escort agency?  It's not all child molesters.  It's people who have to be separated.  Why do I inherently dislike you?  Why do they push you?  Like, everything he says, I'm like, I know, you idiot.  Why do they push you? 
[01:45:30]  You know why?  Because I never got in there when the going was good.  That's why.  No, listen.  Let me answer you.  I was in general population for the first week, and one of the members  of the blood spit in my mouth.  Oh.  And I said, you know what?  Put me into PCs.  Let me just be with older people that are more relaxed, not the young gang.  How did the spit in the mouth thing happen?  He was asking me.  And did you ejaculate?  He was asking me.  Because in my house, that's a big yes, yes. 
[01:46:00]  He was asking me for a cigarette, and I told him to fuck off.  Oh, wait.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hold on.  You could just say F off.  You told him to F off.  But now, why would you?  No, homo.  Are you doing that, like, because you learned you've got to be a tough guy,  and you can't just give him a cigarette because then he would ask for, you know,  the whole pack?  Exactly.  He would never stop asking.  He's an 18-year-old child.  So, you're supposed to go, like, psycho on him and start punching him in the face.  All right.  Anyway, we'll turn to other things because I don't have a lot of time.  My mother died 12 years ago. 
[01:46:30]  My father died February 12th of this year.  I would love to hear from any of my friends or family.  And if they go to my website, jasonitzler.com, it has my prison address where they can reach me.  Do you get visitors?  Send a kite out to you.  Yeah.  Sure.  Hey, did you guys get a lot of famous people at NY Confidential?  Are you guys allowed to have girls come up to your studio and get naked?  Yeah, like now, where are they?  Yeah, where are they?  Okay, what I think you guys should be doing is on Craigslist do a posting for the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:47:00]  and also announce it on the radio.  Do what I used to do, have 10 to 30 girls a day get totally naked, spin around for five seconds,  put their clothes back on, and, you know, the best ones have some type of contest of that nature.  Wow, that sounds like something Howard would do.  With us, Annie, and what I'll tell you that I know from personal experience of interviewing  thousands of girls like that, you never know what you're going to get until you unwrap  the package.  It's like Christmas for a child.  When they rip open the gift, they don't know if they're getting a clunker or something amazing. 
[01:47:30]  Sometimes there's a prison sentence inside.  So tell us about when the blood spit in your mouth.  Nobody just walks up to it, because you walk, are you a mouth breather?  Yeah, what, is your mouth open?  I was talking, and when I said that, the FU, he just spit at me, and I found it very  disgusting.  And I have a...  Can I have a cigarette?  No!  No!  If you guys, if any of you guys were in jail, you would certainly be in PC.  There's no doubt. 
[01:48:00]  You wouldn't be in general population.  Not me.  I'd put that swastik on my back, and I'd start knocking someone's brain down.  That's it.  Just working out with a big Nazi swastik on there.  For the rest of my life, I would go...  Jim, you'd be someone's girlfriend, there's no doubt.  That ain't me.  No, no, I certainly would be.  I would.  I would hustle cigarettes for my man.  At least you'd work for your guy, Jimmy.  I'm not lazy.  I'd be chugging C like the best little girl in the place, but I'd be chugging one.  I'm talking criminal.  Then I'd have the big swastik on my neck, and then for the rest of my life, people would 
[01:48:30]  go like, ooh, and I'd go, no, I was in jail, I just had to survive.  I had to.  I had to survive.  Right.  And I'd be like, so how are you with blacks?  I'm great.  It'd be like American History X, where you take your shirt off.  Big swastika.  Opie or Anthony, Opie or Anthony, question for you.  Yes, sir.  At the beginning of your show, is that your theme song, that music, that kind of Western music?  Oh, yeah, Ecstasy of Gold.  Ecstasy of Gold.  Okay, I think the hottest song in the world is that song that was called Numb, Encore,  Linkin Park and Jay-Z.  That mix.  Do you know it?  Yeah, of course. 
[01:49:00]  Why don't you take that?  That's like the hottest song ever made.  Why don't you put that on at the beginning?  I will do that for a minute.  So, Jason, you're telling everyone today an exclusive.  Because you're cutting edge high.  Opie, hold on.  Opie, hold on.  Jason, so you're trying to tell the whole world today that you're getting out in three  or four months and you're starting right back up?  I'm going to be richer than I've ever been before.  What do you think I do in here?  I think, and I write down business ideas.  My home bill is $200 a week.  How much?  $200 a week, calling lawyers, accountants, Hollywood people. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, you don't have friends and convicts plan?  Verizon has that.  Jeremy Piven is playing me in a movie.  They're starting shooting it in October.  Do you guys know who Piven is?  Yeah.  A little so-called entourage, yes.  I would say his Ari Gold character is my personality, which I've never seen the show.  You guys would know.  But I saw a definition of...  I guess you don't get HBO and Rikers, huh?  What, he got Showtime?  He's sitting around watching Weed.  Get Jeremy Piven immediately.  Is he as hot as they say he is?  I don't know.  He's our leader. 
[01:50:00]  Do you want to know who's playing Natalia?  Who?  Who?  Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Howard's daughter.  Chick from the village.  Yeah.  Is she pretty enough?  I'm not saying anything bad about a Howard girl.  Ah, she's all right.  She's all right.  Anyway, $30 million movie.  But what I need help with from you guys is I don't have a powerful literary agent for  my memoir, for my own book.  You don't need one.  I told my stupid manager out in L.A. to talk.  Did you guys talk to...  He called the guy you wanted him to call.  Okay, just have him send me a FedEx of whatever happened. 
[01:50:30]  And thank you so much for doing that.  I really appreciate it.  Hey, do you have video of Norton at your joint?  Video of...  No.  When they were filming the reality show?  No.  I mean, yes.  Everything was filmed in all the major areas, but only on a two-week loop.  Then we would film all over.  What about important people?  Politicians?  Things like that.  Yeah, give us some names today.  Police?  You want to hear something I've never told anyone?  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, you can tell us something he's never told anyone.  All right, you ready?  Yeah.  I had a top three law school dean in America as a client. 
[01:51:00]  Top three?  And you know what the top three schools in America are, right?  Yale, Harvard, Phoenix.  I'm not even going to say what they are, but I had one of them as my client.  And we became good friends, and I told them every detail of my business, and the guy said  I was 100%.  The CW Post, 100% what?  The reason that I'm in jail and I couldn't fight it and win was because of money laundering.  Money laundering.  What do they consider money laundering was this.  If Opie or Anthony came into my escort agency, on their credit card statement, it would say 
[01:51:30]  Gotham State, like a restaurant.  It wouldn't say New York Confidential.  And then your wife says, why did you eat $6,000 worth of music?  Just for privacy reasons.  It was Kobe B.  Just for privacy reasons that was done.  Yeah.  But by me doing that and doing about $400,000 a month on credit cards, it was huge money laundering.  All right, why are you on the show?  What is it you really want to say?  What's the bottom line?  I'd like to be a regular on your show.  Go right in the background.  Shout over your shoulder.  Shut up, doggy. 
[01:52:00]  Let's hear if you got stones.  You guys are going to be bigger than Howard Stern.  Don't act like you didn't hear what I said.  And I want to get on in the beginning and be in your coattails like any smart person should  want to be.  Now he's talking smart.  Anyway, I want to be a part of this new business venture.  What's the deal with Charlie Sheen?  How do we invest?  Charlie Sheen, I try to tell the world that he's not a pervert, that he's a normal, nice  guy that the girls love.  And then he...  Oh, that was the seven minutes.  No, that was the guy that was just shouting.  Please deposit another big black junk for seven more minutes. 
[01:52:30]  I say have him on the show because he's a dude who'll let you spit in his mouth.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty erotic to me.  That's a big, like, that goes with choking and spanking and fishhooking in my house.  Yeah, that's the moment of truth.  A girl, maybe, one of the bloods does that to you?  Oh, man.  I want him calling every day.  Yes.  Every day for bikers.  Get him on the schedule.  I didn't know that, Opie.  Yeah, I wouldn't have kept my big mouth shut.  No, people are saying you were killing. 
[01:53:00]  All right, we'll take a break.  Something about that guy.  I just hate it automatically.  We got to take a break.  Kevin Smith in the studio.  When I read that article in the New York Magazine, I was like, this guy had a reality  show in a brothel and he's wondering why he's in jail?  And why confidential?  He brought the girls into our show and he gave us all an hour and Norton was the only  one that took it.  And they were the only girls.  And so these dumb strippers that come in, at least they did what they said they were going  to do.  Yeah, they did.  These dumb broads that show up.  All right, we'll continue.  We're real late.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony.  These guys thrash. 
[01:53:30]  Hard.  Come on.  No.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  First half of the show is winding down.  We got about 10, 15 minutes left with Kevin Smith.  Don't forget Clerks 2 coming out very soon.  Jay Moore in studio getting naked.  July 21st.  July 21st.  I just forgot the date.  I'm sorry there, Kevin.  Clerks 2.  We don't even have to talk about it anymore. 
[01:54:00]  I didn't come to Pimp.  I came because I was just in the city.  Eight minutes standing ovation over there.  I mean.  At CamCon.  At CanCon.  Con.  And we got to acknowledge Jay Moore got naked again.  I was there for that one.  You saw it.  I think you want to do it again for Kevin Smith.  Was that an audition or something?  Because you said you were broke.  Well, you should see what Kevin's got in the pipe here.  He just yanked his pants down and jumped all over that intern.  I cannot get my head around.  Maybe if I was thinner and had a good body, I could understand pulling my gear up. 
[01:54:30]  You had to have heard his explanations on the air, like how atrocious this human being  is.  He is the worst.  Like it's not like I grab it and I like, well, I'll like lick my fingertips and then  I'll get like the helmet and like kind of rub it and arouse it.  And then the guy gets kind of turned on.  I'm like, no homo.  Yeah.  It's like, no, your explanation stinks.  And they brought in all the interns to go, yeah, I thought it was just me, but he's  always like touching me in the cockpit.  He's grabbing all the time. 
[01:55:00]  He's grabbing.  They play grab ass.  We got to back up though.  Jay's explanation was brilliant, but I don't think it made it.  Basically, Bobby likes to do gay stuff with his friends, but as long as he says no homo  afterwards, it's okay.  He'll kiss a guy's neck or just kind of gently nuzzle his neck and do something really creepy.  So Jay said, all right, you like to play no homo.  Jay took the game almost to the limit.  Almost as far as you could take it.  The second time he picked me up, so it slipped in his ear.  Then he turned around and tried to yodel to make it look like an accident. 
[01:55:30]  Spit my mouth, spit my mouth, spit my mouth, spit my mouth.  You gave him a fruit basket of sorts, right?  I did.  Yeah, there was a fruit basket going on.  You still want to play the no homo, Bobby?  I don't know.  Is that Mike on?  Give him a silence of the lambs.  I don't know.  Give him a silence of the lambs.  Would you?  Would you?  What is that?  Oh, silence of the lambs.  Best part of the movie.  When she asks if he needs help loading that couch in the van with his broken arm, and he 
[01:56:00]  just goes, would you?  That guy is fantastic.  Bobby?  Yes, hi.  So are you having fun playing no homo with Jay Moore?  Well, you know, Jay made a good point where there's certain people who you should be allowed  to play with and who you shouldn't.  Now I know not to play with Nathaniel, but John's very molestible.  So I figure, I figure, you know, I can't argue with him, with my peers or someone.  That's former child star.  Child star.  We call him former child star.  Pretty cute.  Not that he's been in anything, but doesn't he look like it? 
[01:56:30]  You look like Eddie Munster's doll.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  Wow.  You might remember me from season one of Who's That Girl or something.  So, Bobby, what?  You definitely have that look like you grew up and stopped getting parts.  Yeah.  I played boner in Newsies.  Yes, Bobby, to you.  So I figure if I could play with my peers and my subordinates, then that would be fine.  Subordinates?  Subordinates?  Yeah, well, you don't have subordinates. 
[01:57:00]  Well, just in general.  You are the lowest.  Oh, okay.  And women.  You are the bottom of the barrel.  You know that, right?  I got a couple months on a couple of the guys.  It doesn't matter.  It makes me feel better.  Now, performance.  Like someone like Crazy Bill, he only had like a short time, but he went far and above everybody else real quick.  Yeah.  He was the guy, the go-to guy.  You, on the other hand, you got nothing.  No, I did all right with Ron and Fez. 
[01:57:30]  I think I did all right.  People that have done all right with Ron and Fez have done awful with this show.  Yeah.  Remember my stalker?  Oh, yeah.  What the hell was that idiot's name?  Oh, that ass who would babble at you?  They actually hired him as an intern, and he stalked me at a pool parlor.  Do they have pool parlors?  No, they don't.  Look at me.  Let me tell you.  I got a friend, Shirley.  When his dame walked in, she had some set of stems.  You better get out of here.  That guy just pulled a rod on a dame.  Harvey? 
[01:58:00]  He's still trying to defend no homo, though.  I don't get that.  Have you ever had a homosexual experience?  No.  You're lying.  What about when you were, like, eight?  No.  Anything.  I could have repressed something, but I don't think so.  Yeah, you repressed it right now.  All right, look.  When I was seven years old, me and a kid did that.  Okay.  Was his name Jimmy Norton?  No.  It was Monster Rain-esque, but we did it in his clubhouse.  And there was two.  I'll save it all for XM when you make the move with us. 
[01:58:30]  Well, he was seven, you were 30.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I just sound like David Caruso in every CSI.  I'll be.  Have you seen a loan?  No, a loan owner?  What's that, Jay?  Never heard of it.  Are we done with Bobby?  We done with Bobby?  No, I don't believe that he never had a...  Yeah, come on.  What happened?  Something happened.  I don't believe you never stored them in the side of your mouth.  What is it? 
[01:59:00]  I know you're trying to goat me into saying one.  I'm thinking I really...  There was a goat?  Now, what happened?  I really...  I've never had a homosexual experience.  You've had two today alone.  Well, that's not really...  That's just two guys forcing around.  I hope he does save his jokes for the end of the show.  I want them to remember me last.  Jay Moore just treated your face like a blow-up doll.  No kidding, man.  Who are you...  You had two today.  Lucky dog.  We were just messing around, right, Jay?  See how he does wee?  Like, now he's trying to make it like...  Pull you into it.  And then Jay goes,  Bobby, come here during the commercial break 
[01:59:30]  and kind of starts opening his pants  and Bobby jumped up out of his chair  and was right next to Jay in a second.  Like, I'm kidding, unless I'm not.  Yeah.  Like, in a massage parlor when you're like,  could you...  No, I'm kidding.  Unless I'm not.  I don't know how it works here.  Two guys, two friends when you're a kid.  What happened?  No, there was nothing.  Did you ever cross swords behind the garage?  Never crossed swords.  Now, you are absolutely lying.  Anything with a girl when you were at an inappropriate age?  Yes.  Oh.  How old was she?  Same age as me. 
[02:00:00]  And one was a couple years older.  Her name was Billy.  What did you guys do besides you unzipped her pants  and went, yuck, where is it?  No, it was when I was younger,  I used to get naked with the girl down the block  in my basement.  Yeah.  And I really didn't know what to do,  but we used to get naked.  Rape kit and crawl space.  We're here with...  You forgot?  I knew you forgot it.  I wrote it down.  You wrote it down in the day planner?  You write bits?  I wrote it down.  Rape kit and crawl space.  What's your name?  Bobby.  What's your middle name? 
[02:00:30]  I don't have a middle name.  This is a lie.  Middle child?  No.  First.  Premature birth, right?  Uh, no.  Yeah.  You missed every mark.  I don't know.  Except his ear and the back of his neck  that you hit right on target.  When he picked me up,  it drew me closer to him  where I felt heat when he got flushed.  I felt it all mush  against your neck and face.  See, I didn't think you were naked that time,  so I figured I'd try to, like,  throw you a little in there.  Everyone else knew he was naked. 
[02:01:00]  You know me, I never push it.  But from my peripheral,  you had your pants around your ankle,  so my peripheral,  I saw, like, your pants were on still.  You're such a liar.  The whole studio knew he was naked.  I saw the inside of the crotch of your pants.  You actually painted a target  around your mouth.  Oh.  You liked it, didn't you?  That was good enough.  All right, Bobby.  I kind of liked it.  Bobby and his no-homo game.  How old are you, Bobby?  21.  You gambling, man?  Yeah, I like to gamble.  I'll bet you $5.  I can get you to perform on me 
[02:01:30]  if I worked here.  If you worked,  how would that work?  How is that a discussion?  How would that work?  Get out!  How does the show?  You wanted out of here.  No, get out of here.  Not coming after that.  I'm a gambling man.  You're putting stipulations on it.  We're done with you.  We're done, dude.  Wow.  You are, like, so gay.  You're William Bendix  and you're gay.  Beat it.  William Bendix?  He's asking questions.  After that statement, 
[02:02:00]  he has...  You worked here.  Go.  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  All right.  Cute kid.  He's cute.  Girls like him.  No marks.  No marks.  Clean.  I won't have my money  with him last six fights.  I'll get you both in the ring.  Get you both in the effing beat  and let you eff each other.  Best line is...  I don't want to get blood on my suit.  I'll get blood on my suit.  He used to that.  That awkward smile that Pesci had.  And the Pesci said,  ah, it's okay, guys. 
[02:02:30]  Drink up, Jake.  It's ginger ale.  All right.  I guess we're going to...  It's just about time.  Yeah, we're out of time.  It's about time to...  What happens now?  There's a big walk that happens.  Now there's a big mic walk.  People put pictures of, like,  some Jewish horse on whack bag,  like, this is the hot 18-year-old  that was on the walk today.  Oh, you saw that.  I'm like, this is what you're drawing  to your walk.  That's it.  But you're a big star.  We've had two girls show up so far.  And all guys.  Yeah.  Where are all these hitlers?  Yeah, we're going to be...  There they go.  We're going to be in the lobby  in a few minutes here.  And then, Kevin,  you doing the walk with us today?  I am.  I had no idea there were going 
[02:03:00]  to be athletics involved  in being on the show today.  It's a half block.  I guess I'll...  We have to get to the other studio  to do the second half of the show.  Can we cab it?  We got to...  When does Clerks 2 come out?  July 21st, sir.  July 21st.  July 21st.  Yep.  Clerks 2.  We need to do it.  We need to take this country back.  Hey, wait.  Weren't you just...  You were just in a film  in the Trebekah Film Festival?  I'm here to promote nothing.  I know, but...  Wait, what was the film?  Where did he end up?  You were in an Edward Burns film, sir.  The Groomsman.  The Groomsman.  How did it go?  It was wonderful.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  It was good.  It was like his...  Like the one he was supposed  to have been making.  Like it all came together.  And who else is...  It's you.  It's John Leguizamo, yeah?  Yeah.  Matthew Lillard, Donald Logue.  Matthew Lillard, man.  That dude was...  I know I shouldn't say it,  but that dude's a genius  in those Scooby-Doo movies.  I love Matthew.  I think he's insanely brilliant.  I think that's like such an insane  like shaggy...  SLC Punk.  No, man.  Let me tell you something.  SLC Punk.  That was a great one.  And that director,  Madrinos, just vanished.  Like that was the only movie 
[02:04:00]  I've ever seen where I went...  Of SLC Punk?  Who was this director?  I've never heard of him before  and I've never seen anyone  shoot things this way before.  That was really good.  I mean, it wasn't like new,  but it was new enough  where you, you know...  And he didn't follow up?  You tell me.  You're in the business.  Where'd he go?  Where'd he go?  Look him up.  Jesus.  What a mess.  What a mess.  What a mess.  I'm watching Scooby-Doo  with my son  and then Scrappy-Doo  stands up  and archs one  onto Sarah Michelle Gellis' chest 
[02:04:30]  and I go,  ooh.  And my son goes,  Scrappy made a mess.  I'm like,  yeah,  but it's good with nothing.  Scrappy Norton.  You see it?  No.  The freaking dog.  It's like,  he's got a pain  and they won't pull over  and then Scrappy-Doo  just like,  shrouds her chest  like,  and then you're showing.  He just puts a map of Hawaii  on her charm pendant  around her neck.  Oh, 
[02:05:00]  map of Hawaii.  A risque.  Or a Scooby flick.  Come on,  let's go where we can curse.  All right,  we're gonna...  And then while we walk in,  you guys check XM stock  and see what that is  and then look at Sirius stock  and see what that is  and then you still decide  which company's better.  Well,  XM has had a rough road  the last couple of weeks.  It's getting closer.  I don't know,  let's see what it opens up today.  It's no Time Warner.  Let me get this straight.  I'm in New York.  I can't watch a Yankee  or a Met game  in my hotel room.  You jerks.  Isn't that great?  Why can't you?  Because they bought it  and made a new network 
[02:05:30]  that you have to pay.  Yes,  like you are.  You like the Yankees?  Well,  now we own them.  Screw you.  Change your subscriber.  No,  I won't.  None for you,  Mr. Hitler.  It used to be Channel 9  or Channel 11  whether you're a Mets  or a Yankee fan.  Now you get nothing.  It's not amazing.  Yeah.  It's all about  the almighty dollar,  why is Al Roker  sitting there with her?  Would you stop?  They're looking back  on Katie Couric's career.  Is that what they pulled  out of her colon? 
[02:06:00]  A chimpanzee?  15 years.  Who's the guy  next to Al Roker?  He's doing visuals now  for the radio show.  Thank you,  Jay.  You are awful.  Thanks for helping us out  today,  Mike.  You are awful,  Jay.  You're pointing out  the pretty pictures  on the TV.  I knew Jimmy was going to say  I was just  please Jimmy,  don't let me down.  Is there nothing  cuter than a baby chimp?  What,  especially when  doing the wedding?  All right.  Wow.  I heard that little  chimp had a stomach  stable,  did he? 
[02:06:30]  Where's my,  I don't even have  my inappropriate bell.  Have you seen  Randy Jackson's belly  after his surgery?  No.  It's big.  All right.  Enough.  Yeah,  this is fat man.  The wheels are falling  off.  I want to thank  Kevin Smith  just in case people  aren't listening  to the second half  of the show today.  Clerks 2,  of course.  And I want to  thank Jay Moore  as well.  I'm only here  to promote  Clerks 2.  July 21st?  Yes,  July 21st.  Is there a website  they can go to?  Is it Clerks 2?  Clerks 2.com. 
[02:07:00]  Clerks 2.  Number 2?  Number 2.  Look at you,  you're all over.  Clerks,  number 2.  It's so charming  how enamored  of the monkey  you are.  Ew,  it's a family reunion.  All that's missing  is the potato salad.  Jay's running  out of the studio.  What is wrong with him?  What is wrong with him? 
[02:07:30]  Holy Jesus.  That's insanity.  We had to flee  the studio  with that last line.  We love doing radio  with Jay  but it's a pain  in the ass.  Oh my God.  We have to go  into ADD mode.  Yeah,  he has attention  deficit disorder.  We have to go  into ADD mode.  The subject just flies  from one to another  and then he just  will go off  on the most  inappropriate stuff.  Oh my God.  Now he just ran  out of the studio.  He'll probably run  back in here naked again.  You never know.  Jump on it.  All right,  everybody.  Watch it next.  We got to get out of here. 
[02:08:00]  We'll continue on XM.  Thanks for checking us  out today, guys.  We greatly appreciate  that.  See you tomorrow, man.  We're out.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  It's a lunatic.  The O.P. and Anthony  XM walkover  begins now.  Move!  I'm going to get killed here.  Come on, you assholes.  Move!  Fucking move! 
[02:08:30]  Fucking move!  Bitch!  Get out the way!  Come on, you asshole!  Fucking move!  Bitch!  Get out the way!  Get the fuck out!  Way!  Fuck!  And we're live outside  Free FM here in New York City.  Kevin Smith wasn't allowed  to smoke in the outdoor lobby.  He already got yelled at.  There's like an outdoor breezeway 
[02:09:00]  that goes between 56th and 57th,  and it's totally open,  but they kicked him out.  Un-fucking-believable.  That doesn't sound too fair.  What they've done to the poor smoker.  We got a nice crowd out here  this morning.  Who moved you?  Oh, he was nice about it,  the dude in the white shirt.  Oh, they're all nice about it.  I guess somebody said something to him  and we had to move out.  You know who were nice at one point?  The brown shirts.  They would say,  Jew, please leave. 
[02:09:30]  And then you saw how  that whole thing turned out.  It starts very polite.  It moves right into the ovens.  Right into the ovens.  If excuse me doesn't work,  you're running through the ghetto  in a red dress.  Well, I want to say hi to all the women  that joined us for the walk today.  Oh, yeah, again,  just a bevy of broads.  Hey, oh, we got a girl.  We have one girl, Alicia.  There's a girl.  A girl.  New Jersey,  only the strong survive.  Hello.  Yeah, you Jersey girl, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah, what part? 
[02:10:00]  Bloomfield.  Yeah, Bloomfield.  Hey, fellow Jersey girl, huh?  There she is.  Alicia, she's a lovely girl.  Yeah?  You came down here to see what?  Anything?  You.  Us?  And Kevin, right?  And Kevin.  Yeah.  And Jay.  And Jimmy.  And Poe.  Name everybody.  And everybody.  Yeah.  Very good.  Who's that?  Your boyfriend?  Yep.  Your boyfriend.  All right, we're done with you.  All right, let's start the walk,  tax ab.  All right.  Yeah, let's start this godforsaken walk. 
[02:10:30]  How much longer is this going to last?  I'm a walk.  Amen.  Jesus Christ,  how many fucking feet of film  or miles of videotape  of this walk do you have, sir?  I've never seen a shorter  long-sleeved shirt  than Bam is wearing right now.  Bam is like,  he has taped  every single one of these.  Ask this guy  if it's Ash Wednesday.  Go ahead, go ahead.  I dare you.  Isn't it?  No, he's got one of those  big things on his head.  Ew, is that a fucking mole?  That was like a, 
[02:11:00]  who's got that big one?  Aaron Neville.  Aaron Neville.  He should be decapitated.  Right in the middle of his head.  Right in the middle of his forehead.  Just get it fucking fixed.  Stop pretending it's okay.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Your tie's crooked, sir.  Yeah.  God, all these video cameras.  I don't understand  what they use this for.  I don't like it.  I don't know  what they're going to use this for.  Hey, Conchita.  Hello, miss.  Good, cunt.  Oh, look at that.  Bet you would have wished  a little more calcium  in the youth. 
[02:11:30]  Might not have, uh...  Oh, she didn't like that.  That's great.  Well, how can't she?  She's 90.  She's pushing like a walker.  And one of those  rolly walkers with handbrakes.  And tennis balls  on the bottom.  She probably survived polio  and you're telling her  she had bad eating habits.  Look at this engine  with toothpick legs.  All right.  Oh, she's sexy.  Hmm.  There's a fan  with a wow sticker  and a van.  There he is.  It's going to work.  It's cool.  There's a...  See a woman's face  pressed up against a glass.  Screaming, 
[02:12:00]  help, help, help.  All right.  Look at this little redhead.  She's lovely.  She's a little dumpy, Jim.  I know.  I like that.  I have to...  Hi, I missed.  We're doing a story  on people traveling.  Hi.  Okay.  Hi, we're doing a story  on the weather.  What's in that bag, AIDS?  Let's get her!  Hey, Martin,  let's get her. 
[02:12:30]  She didn't want to talk.  Boy, New Yorkers  just do not have  the same head  that anywhere else does.  You put a mic  in someone's face  in Michigan  and they can't stop talking.  New York's like,  nah, go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  All right,  why don't we cross  the street?  New York doesn't care.  It's Black Santa.  Look to the left.  There he is,  Black Santa.  Oh.  Sambo Claus.  Ho, ho, ho,  where's my money? 
[02:13:00]  Oh, look at this.  Look at that on the corner.  What is it?  Um, that's fucking,  that short androgynous creature.  Yeah.  That genderless monster.  Okay.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, she's on the move.  She looks like  Billie Jean King.  Hi, sir.  My good business.  Didn't get that job. 
[02:13:30]  He went for it, too.  All right.  Good old Mac.  Well, Mac's here.  Mac's still got his new class.  How you doing, Mac?  Doing all right?  How'd you get coffee today?  Got any of that money left over?  Nah.  Nah?  You spent it all?  Yeah.  You need some more, huh?  Yeah, I can use it.  Maybe Jay Moore will give you some.  This old gag.  Thank you.  Great.  Thanks very much.  Mac's in some bad shape.  Which Isley is that? 
[02:14:00]  Mac's in some bad shape.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm in bad shape today.  Why?  On the holiday.  Oh, the holiday?  You're a little hungover?  Yeah.  You drank a little bit?  A little bit.  What'd you have?  Some rat good?  A little wine.  A little wine.  Yeah.  Memorial Day.  Let's give him a dollar for every push-up he could do.  His legs would fall off.  Stop it.  How about 500?  You go to the doctor about your legs yet?  Not yet.  What are you?  You're a crazy person. 
[02:14:30]  Nah, I've been working on it myself.  What do you do to yourself to help him?  You can't.  Nah, it's just that change the way the wound is at.  That's just my skin.  I got bad skin.  Oh, the rest is just bad skin where it looks like alligator?  Yeah.  But the wound won't go away.  It's healing up.  It's healing up.  I'd hate to see what's underneath there.  All right there, Mac.  Good seeing you again.  Come on.  We'll see if we see him next to walk. 
[02:15:00]  That was a very kickable dog that just passed by.  Wow.  Wow, wait.  She's sexy.  All right.  Fuck.  I want a smoothie today, by the way.  Do ya?  Smoothies.  Miss, can we ask you a few questions?  Ugh.  Then I just walk away.  Good.  All right, let me get this lady with no bra.  Go ahead, go ahead.  Miss, we're doing a story on braless people in New York.  Wow.  Holy shit, what awful tits. 
[02:15:30]  Those are udders.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Say it's bra list Tuesday.  What?  What happened?  What?  They're with babies.  What happened?  Hi.  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Manhattan.  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  You're from Manhattan.  You're from Manhattan.  What happened? 
[02:16:00]  What happened?  We're from Minnesota.  We're from Manhattan.  Hi, we're from Minnesota.  Happy to be here.  Minnesota.  Well, welcome, Minnesota.  Ask her why she threw that hat in the helicopter.  What else can I say?  We love the Big Apple.  Who doesn't?  It's a great city.  Isn't it a great city?  Wait, you got a little tourist map there.  Where are you going to see?  What are you going to see?  We are going on the double-decker bus today.  Oh, I love the double-decker bus when they turn in front of me when I'm trying to drive  home from work.  It's a great thing.  Upper-decker bus.  Aw, and what's that baby's name? 
[02:16:30]  Grace Ann.  Grace Ann?  Yeah.  Aw, and what about that baby?  What's that baby's name?  Oh, God.  Aw, Gary Glitter would love him.  Noah.  All right.  Who are you guys?  The Greg and Tony show.  Oh, the Greg and Tony show.  We just walk around Manhattan all day greeting the tourists.  Okay.  Isn't it wonderful?  Three years old.  They're getting scared now.  All right.  Have fun on your tour of New York City.  There we go.  A couple folks from Minnesota.  Yeah, have somebody tell you what that wow means, girl. 
[02:17:00]  That's wonderful.  It's wow.  You turn it upside down, it's mom.  Wow, it must be ugly baby day, by the way.  Here's another one.  Don't goof on people's babies.  The little one, the middle one, and the yellow.  Where?  Why the bruise, man?  What happened?  What happened?  It's so weird.  Nothing?  You hit a door?  Mm-hmm.  The girl in my son's preschool.  Did I go home?  Hi, miss.  We're doing a story on, um...  All right.  Hey.  Nothing.  They keep walking away.  They're on to it. 
[02:17:30]  Missed.  You want to, uh...  Yeah.  Fucking hate people.  Just talk your personality to this twat.  All right.  We're just about to XM.  We're going to get some smoothies and continue the program.  How do you not talk when somebody stops with a microphone?  I don't know.  Just like everybody did.  You dropped something.  You just keep walking.  I think we're going to get Taylor Hicks on the show.  The second half of the show today.  In the studio or phoner?  Just a quick phoner with him.  Hi, miss.  We're doing a story on the street. 
[02:18:00]  What happened?  About women who are too old for their hair color.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  That was funny.  I try to be nice.  They don't respond to that.  You got to hit below the belt.  Then you got to hit them hard.  Here comes...  Well, she's probably coming into the building, though.  Yeah, we can't get from people that...  We're getting in a lot of trouble as far as that goes.  Oh, fuck this building.  We're going to the building.  Should we just go inside?  All right.  Is there anybody else walking here that we can have fun with?  Jay, did you like the walk?  Isn't it exciting?  I'm kind of in the middle of a story.  I'm talking to Kevin Smith here. 
[02:18:30]  Oh.  I got to tell you about that walk.  Hold on.  A lot of Asians.  Not the youngest Asian that was laying flat in the stroller, but the one that was in  the yellow, like six or so.  Yeah.  Don't tell me the child wasn't aware of her sexuality.  Jimmy?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Spend that one.  She was very...  No, the mother with the hat.  Oh, I didn't...  I noticed that she was walking away, the rotten kid.  No, not the kid.  The mom.  I didn't like the mom, either.  Throw me under a bus.  I didn't notice it. 
[02:19:00]  Get away from me.  I'll throw you under a bus.  She fucking, you nose dove.  She can drink patty water.  Why is Robert Chambers taking your photo?  This kid's bugging me.  Stupid camera.  Fuck off two megapixels.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Oh.  Whoa, whoa.  What happened?  When's the big day?  She's just fat, Anthony.  When's the baby do?  Oh, come on.  She's just fat.  She's just fat.  I thought she was.  You look a little chilly. 
[02:19:30]  What am I doing?  Crowd work on the sidewalk?  Well, that's what we're trying to do.  It's Peter Coyote from Jagged Edge.  Over here.  All right.  Party rock.  Why am I holding a mic?  Jimmy, how dare you?  Hello, sir.  What the fuck?  We're just waiting for other people that might be of interest.  Look at the old boy.  That old guy.  Junior.  Hey, Junior.  Tony, I got the big casino, Tony. 
[02:20:00]  You want to break my balls?  Tell me there's a blunt in the jog.  I'm coming to look.  I fucking blew it.  Ah, you don't have your car crash.  That's my masseuse.  All right.  We're going to.  This guy's stealing a bike right in front of our eyes.  With a key.  With a key.  Yeah, that's what they make it look like.  This guy just won the Truman Capote look-alike contest.  All right.  We're going to continue the second half of the week. 
[02:20:30]  You know what?  I haven't done this yet.  Oh, this is a resounding failure.  You do this every day?  Yep.  Hey, sometimes it's gold.  Yeah, we have a lot of laughs doing this.  Today, tin.  Which house, sir?  Yeah, the homeless guy.  You got to see his leg.  It's really bad.  Looks like an alligator leg.  Old scaly.  Why don't we go upstairs?  Yes, smoothie for me.  All right.  We'll be upstairs in a minute.  Locked up with the XM202.  Mexican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV. 
[02:21:00]  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  Elvidos.  The Opie and Anthony. 
[02:21:30]  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, man.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:22:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, my goodness gracious. 
[02:22:30]  Hi, everybody.  Welcome.  O&A show.  Part Ducks.  Here from XM Satellite Radio.  Unfettered and uncensored.  If you join us here every day, as opposed to our CBS FM show.  Hi. 
[02:23:00]  Everyone else wants to take a piss.  I'm the one who has a steel bladder.  That's what they call me.  Old Steel Bladder.  And I don't have to.  I take a leak.  Although, in about a half hour or so, I start doing the pee-pee dance in my seat.  Where I can't stop moving because I got to pee real bad.  But no one really seems to care because they don't break for an hour and a half. 
[02:23:30]  See, they take a piss.  Miss the beginning of the show.  I have a responsibility to come in and start the show.  So I don't piss.  But I can't then go an hour and a half without taking a leak after doing the entire morning part of the show without taking a leak.  And no one's here to help me.  Isn't this fucking great?  Thanks.  Who's coming in?  I see Big Kev.  I see Interns.  I see Kevin Smith.  That's good. 
[02:24:00]  Kevin Smith.  Jay Moore.  Take a seat.  Join the Opie and Anthony show.  Sans Opie.  They always do this to me.  They come in to take a leak.  And then the show's already starting by the time we're in the elevator.  And for some reason...  Where are all the fans?  Quote-unquote fans.  Here's a couple of celebrity guys like you and Opie and Jimmy.  You got Kevin Smith.  We don't announce where we are.  So they don't know where we even are.  Please.  Go to full-blown AIDS.  They know where you are. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, you go to them all, huh?  I go to UncleInky.com.  The message boards.  We spoke about message boards last time you were here, Kevin.  Mike smells good.  And they're just the worst.  They are the worst.  And Jay is obsessed with Wackbag.  Oh, no.  I go all over.  How come you don't have cocks up there?  Oh, Nicky.  I thought you just wanted it like the intern.  You just wanted various pictures of cocks up on the wall.  No, I'm not.  I pinched his ball bag in the way anyway. 
[02:25:00]  Thank you.  See, he loves it.  Go to, if you go to Wackbag, I'll show you a funny picture of me and her where I have like this, like I have a heart on in my pants where we're just walking down the street.  Where was it taken?  Press or just?  No, it was just some guy behind a tree, Ventura Boulevard.  Paparazzi?  And her nips are out and like, I wasn't, you know, I'm not even looking at me.  And then I look at me and I go, Jesus.  Jay Moore, hard at work.  Do it.  No, I can't do it now.  Come on. 
[02:25:30]  I swear.  I got it.  First, I got to get Pal Talk up.  Or else they get mad.  When are we going to have Pal Talk cameras in the other building?  Working on it.  When are you going to have Richard Reifers back and not have him know you're laughing at him?  He was all right.  Yeah, he was a little.  No, dude.  He was all right.  There he goes.  And then six months was the first arrest.  And then he laughed at himself silly.  And then you guys started laughing at the way he was laughing.  And then he's like.  And then you guys went like ape shit.  Dude, Jaws. 
[02:26:00]  Close encounters.  You got to give him some respect.  That's right.  A little respect.  No matter how goofy he is.  I'm giving him the respect.  We want to hear the seven-year-old story.  We're not on that free FM anymore.  Oh, me and this kid, Eddie Collins, would suck each other's dicks.  Oh, Eddie Collins?  In Danny Morton's clubhouse?  Fast Eddie Collins?  We know him.  And it was, don't piss in my mouth or I'll bite your dick.  Well, don't bite my dick or I'll piss in your mouth.  It was cyclical, the conversation.  Sure.  I had my mouth pissed in in a pool doing the same thing.  Completely true.  Submerged? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, I was underwater.  I didn't think people could see me doing it.  And he whizzed in my mouth.  And I'm like, don't do that again.  And he did.  That goose.  And he did.  Yep.  So you played Monster Pools?  What was his name?  Yeah, I was, I don't want to say his name.  Well, I just outed this guy and he's a cop.  Oh, no, no.  I'm not saying.  Why would you say his name?  Not because of protecting him.  I just hate him.  You want to give him the props.  Right.  For pissing in your mouth.  Exactly.  He's Mike smelling fantastic.  He's Mike smelling the florist show world. 
[02:27:00]  Let's go to Nick in North Dakota.  Nick, what's going on?  I guess I'll finish the story later.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, I want to hear the rest of the story.  The guy with ADD is calling me out on an ADD.  Who is the bigger boy, Jay?  What do you think?  I just figured you want to do five or six things at one time like you usually do.  I'm sorry that you're actually going to focus for once.  He's a cop.  I'm a cop.  You idiot.  Me and my sister were driving to see my dad race when he was racing spec racers.  Right.  And he was at Bridgehampton and we were going through Long Island and we were doing like  a billion. 
[02:27:30]  And he pulled us over.  No, it was somewhere in Pennsylvania.  I forget.  It was Watkins Glen.  So we take 80 to 380 and I'm doing like 120.  She's doing 100.  She's in my mom's Cobra and I'm in my friend's FBI car that's all in German, has no paperwork.  He's an actual guy in the bureau.  Yeah.  And he goes, if you get pulled over, just say you're my brother.  So I go, okay.  And then we get pulled over.  Both of us at the same time doing 120.  And he goes, paperwork.  And I look in the glove box.  It's just empty. 
[02:28:00]  It's like a spec car.  There's nothing in it.  And everything's in German.  I don't know anything.  I go, it's my brother's car.  And he goes, really?  Who's your brother?  I go, Jeffrey.  I can't see his name in the air.  I go, Jeffrey something something.  He goes, all right.  Why do you guys have different last names?  I go, he told me if I get pulled over to tell you he's my brother.  And then he goes, all right.  And he comes back.  He goes, do you know your brother's car isn't insured or registered?  I go, no, I didn't know that.  I go, you know what?  While we're on the subject, I think you should call Eddie Conlon.  I think you should call Eddie Conlon and let him know that we're sitting here talking. 
[02:28:30]  Officer Eddie Conlon.  I'm pretty sure.  I mean, this is like a big deal.  Eddie Conlon should know that I'm here.  He's a Jersey City trooper.  And then he let me go.  Based on that.  Well, yeah, because you're not going to have a cop go, oh, that's the guy whose dick I  sucked when I was in third grade.  You don't want him asking questions.  That must have been one hell of a fucking blowjob, sir.  Yeah, right?  That gets you off.  Seven?  Twice.  We used to take the blankets across the living room when you make a fort, and we would just  suck each other off with my parents watching TV, like with their legs up on the furniture 
[02:29:00]  we were making the thing with.  And they had no idea what you were doing.  They just went, oh, oh, oh.  They probably just thought we were kissing.  They ate a lot of ice cream in the head, those two.  They're like, as long as they don't take it in the ass, they're not gay.  Let them go.  Let them go.  Yeah, right?  Like, I'm not gay.  I'm angry.  It's a phase.  I'm not a homophobic.  If I hate gays, I'm not afraid of them.  Who are all these young ladies you have up here?  This is Pal Talk.  See, we got a camera up there. 
[02:29:30]  We got another one over there.  And that's us.  Here's the studio.  And then these are all the other girls that say, come on, girls, wave.  Say hi.  Come on.  Where are you?  Where's Red Rum?  Is she up?  Oh, my God.  One girl who really loves this show.  Red Rum usually showers about now.  She's a lovely one.  Ah, look at that blonde in the white t-shirt.  You're a little special manx, aren't you?  Wow.  We got lots of dumps today.  Oh, the daily dump sheet.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Can we get the sounder?  Rub it and arouse it?  Got bleeped?  Wait until the sounder plays.  It would have said it.  It would have.  Anthony's a professor at this stuff.  What happened, Tham?  Why?  Wait.  We need the intro.  Hi, honey.  I see you waving in your brow.  A little blonde up the left-hand corner.  Yeah, they hear everything you say.  In the attic masturbating.  It's dumped.  Oh, boy.  Can you believe it?  Who's brushing her hair?  She doesn't even look old enough to be brushing hair.  Is it because Derek isn't here and he's the only one that knows where it is? 
[02:30:30]  So we don't have it today?  All right.  Then one of the guys should sing the intro.  One of the guys has to sing it or say it.  How does it go?  It says it's time to read.  It's time to read.  The daily dump sheet.  Nothing.  All right.  Let's get into the dump.  Why is there an empty chair in that one?  Why don't you close that empty chair?  Oh, we got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We still come back on.  Oh, you found it?  E-Rock found it.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Here it is. 
[02:31:00]  Our FCC.  So we don't get in trouble dumps for Tuesday, May 30th, 2006.  At 6.24 a.m., you may have heard, you brainwashed fucking parrot.  That came from me.  Another dump for me.  Technically slander because you can't mention the bird.  Right.  That poor parrot.  That was Anthony to a caller saying they were ripping off Howard.  Howard, at 6.27 a.m., go the fuck away.  Opie shouting at the same caller saying they are ripping off Howard hoo-hoo. 
[02:31:30]  7.23 a.m., ah, fuck it.  Opie showing Kevin Smith that it's okay to curse here.  Told you.  And he dumped out.  They did dump that.  That one I can kind of understand.  7.56 in the attic masturbating.  Yeah, masturbating is now a word.  That could be a book title.  Masturbating is now a word that is frowned upon by the FCC and you will get a violation.  Who's this dirty girl smoking?  I see you blondie smoking your cigarette.  Oh, I would be here all day.  Look at this big-titted animal.  That's why the fucking camera stayed open, asshole, you see? 
[02:32:00]  Don't you asshole me, you can't even walk, motherfucker.  You said to close it.  It's an empty chair.  Close the window.  I saw what was coming.  Does anyone ever show me?  What am I, stupid?  I still like upper left.  Can't corner the most.  Upper left?  Lil?  Hi, Lil.  Right there?  Yeah.  All right.  Dirty bitch.  6.19 a.m.  Best fucking idea of my life.  Jason Itzler from jail.  7.20 a.m.  Jason Itzler again.  I am so fucking something. 
[02:32:30]  We stopped him, I guess.  8.22 a.m.  And did you ejaculate?  Jay Moore to Jay Itzler after I said a gang member spit in his mouth.  Yeah, ejaculate is one of those words that they just don't like anymore.  XM heard it.  You see, he gets mad.  8.22, fuck off.  That was Jason.  8.40, rub it and arouse it.  Now, let me tell you why.  Because of the conversation that happened before that, that taken in that context is bad. 
[02:33:00]  Lil's back.  Hi, Lil.  Yeah.  8.40 a.m.  She's a dirty bird.  Slipped and put it in his ear.  Smoking.  Jay Moore talking about his junk, taking his junk out.  Slipped and put it in his ear.  Because of the description, again, before that, you conjured up the visualization that  you knew it was a cock going in an ear.  If it was a Q-tip we were talking about, and he slipped and went in the ear, you could  say that line.  But now they're taking, you know, 15 minutes before of what you said, and then based on 
[02:33:30]  that, they can fuck you over.  You gotta vote liberal.  I've never said that in my life, but I want a bleeding heart in office.  You need some...  This is that religious conservative shit.  I had my dick and ball bag and asshole on that fucking half a Puerto Rican's face.  That doesn't get bleeped?  Yeah.  Well, because there was no audio.  Jay Moore at age 15.  Lil, I'm sorry to raise my voice.  I'm just trying to...  Several references to Scrappy Doo going to the bathroom on Sarah Michelle Gellar.  That's what happened.  Yeah, you can show that in a PG movie, but you can't mention it on the radio.  You can show it in a PG movie, but you cannot describe it on the radio.  Isn't that crazy? 
[02:34:00]  Urination and pissing on people.  They dumped out of that whole section, by the way.  Can you believe that?  That was multiple dumps going on there.  Now, are any of these girls typing to you, particularly...  Are any of them typing about me?  We'll figure that out.  I am very surprised at 851, which was me, hey, did they pull out of her...  What did they pull out of her colon?  A chimpanzee?  Why would they dump that?  Now, that was because she got a colonoscopy on TV, and... 
[02:34:30]  She did?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, a couple years ago?  After her husband died of colon cancer.  Like live on television?  Yeah, live on TV.  She took a camera.  She took the camera up the ass, and that's kind of what I was alluding to.  Was that the highest rated show of all time on the Today Show?  I think it was.  Yeah.  It would have to be.  It was Matt Lauer's fist.  And some lard.  He had a camera on his caligula.  So, the idea was she...  Her husband died of cancer, and so she wanted to...  Awareness.  And, yeah, there she was laying on her side with a little bit of allium.  They took the hose, jammed it up her ass, and showed the screen of what the inside of 
[02:35:00]  Katie Couric's colon looked like.  Jay, grab aunt's cuss.  No.  Don't.  Jay's reading what they're saying on Pal Talk.  The best one is, they think it's really funny that we can't keep you focused.  It's impossible.  We always say this.  Anytime we hear Jay Moore is going to be on, we say, oh boy, there's no keeping Jay focused.  But, that's part of the beauty of having Jay on.  You never know what you're going to talk about.  I have a great joke for that, too.  Do you?  It's like doing radio on crack. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, you guys.  What did we give you?  The crash looks so bad.  Wow.  We even deserve a crash.  Wow.  You don't like on crack jokes?  Those are pretty funny.  Oh, on crack, or on speed, or on steroids.  Someone told them from hell.  From hell.  The date from hell.  You know, you're right.  Or if you're Jewish, it's because you're Jewish.  She came over here, too.  Yeah, the hole follows us here.  You know, we do the whole walk.  She really has no power.  A Jew in the heat.  Stop it.  Come on.  Stop.  Now, Jay.  Jay Moore. 
[02:36:00]  Look at that chick.  Who's the one on the left?  You ever have a meatloaf and there are peas in it?  I like Lil.  Lil knows she's my girl.  Yeah.  How long are you guys going to keep doing that walk live on the air?  Well, until it gets cold.  Obviously, it was a bomb today, but other days, we have radio magic.  First of all, we need more mics.  That's paramount.  And we stopped having kind of themes.  We had some cool things happen in the past.  We asked for more microphones because we have guests that walk with us, so it would be great  to have you guys mic'd, but they, uh, yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Well, we asked for the mics a week to go.  All you would have heard if I was mic'd was,  Just some heavy breathing.  This walk is too far.  Oh, man.  That was the longest.  Oh, smoothies.  Hey, Lil, we just brought smoothies in.  You want one?  Where are you from, Lil?  Boy, he likes Lil.  Yeah, I like Lil.  She's in Atlanta.  She's a good girl.  Jimmy knows all the girls, where they're from, their real names, what they drive.  So what do you do?  Do you want PalTalk and you jerk off?  No.  Just talk to people? 
[02:37:00]  No.  No, let me show you a little something about PalTalk.  Let me pull.  She's making it go in her pits.  Let's see how quickly we can do this.  We'll pull the room up.  We'll go to adults.  We'll hit okay.  We'll go to playground.  We'll look at the first thing is anal sex and porn vids.  We will pop it up, and we will pop up some cameras.  One, two, three, four, five.  What the fuck?  Here's what PalTalk's all about, people. 
[02:37:30]  What is it?  I can't see.  People jerking off fucking blowjobs.  And this is all happening live?  Some are live.  Some of them cheat.  Some are just pornos.  This guy is just jacking it.  He's just jacking it live.  That's what I would do.  Well, that's what they do.  Here's another jacker.  And that girl right here is just watching the guys jacking off.  That guy's got a bent cock.  Now, are these people in any way watching this show? 
[02:38:00]  No, not these people.  This woman is shaving.  Just Lil?  Yeah.  Is that a porno movie?  This is someone shaving.  I think this is a porno movie.  This looks like porno.  How much is PalTalk?  I could save a lot of money.  $60 a year.  Oh, what am I doing?  Cheap.  You don't chat anymore.  Just text.  You get on.  You go private.  Like Jimmy does.  And Big A does and gets caught. 
[02:38:30]  Big A was on it.  Got caught.  And somebody captured the video.  And he's got a dick like an Eminem.  And he's trying to jerk off as this girl's just berating him.  And you hear him talking.  It's like, what do you do?  Like what Jimmy said about Bob Kelly's dick.  He wants to put compound W on it.  It's awful.  Compound W.  Oh, you.  That's so worth creating.  July 21st.  Clerks 2.  All right.  Let's go to Melissa in Texas. 
[02:39:00]  Melissa, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Rape Kitten Crawl Space.  We got Melissa.  What's up?  Is Kevin still in the studio?  Yes.  Yes, he is.  Good morning, Opie.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Kevin.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Good morning, Jay.  I wanted to make sure I said hello to everybody so I didn't get.  Of course you did.  I'm berated on the air here.  How about just good morning, everyone?  Good morning, everyone.  There you go.  Jimmy, I am coming to see you all in July.  I just wanted to let you know that.  What?  Where?  This is the girl from MySpace. 
[02:39:30]  Was like, hey, can I come see you in the studio?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Are you inviting girls down to the studio now off of Pal Talk?  No, I'm like, if you want to come, you're more than welcome.  We would let them check up.  Excuse me, Melissa.  What did Jimmy tell you on Pal Talk about coming down here?  Be honest and be very specific.  What did he tell you?  Don't lie and don't cover up.  What did he say as far as coming down to the studio?  Okay, I said, I'm coming up to New York from Texas. 
[02:40:00]  I'd love to come by and see you guys in the studio,  but I never hear you guys talk about it on the radio.  And what did he say?  Like, if you can come by and see.  And he was like, oh, yeah.  He's like, but if you come by, you know, is it just going to be you,  or are you going to be bringing a lot of people?  Right.  By a lot of people, he means a boyfriend.  Let me translate everything.  A lot of people means a boyfriend, or will you be alone?  I just didn't want it to be a mob scene.  Yeah.  He doesn't want a cock blocker.  Yeah.  So he's trying to find out if you're coming by yourself. 
[02:40:30]  What else?  It's going to be me and three of my girlfriends.  Three of your girlfriends.  That's all I wanted to know, is we have the proper amount of seats.  There you go.  Got to get credentials for guests.  Are you staying?  Don't mention the place or anything, but you have a place to stay, a hotel?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be for my birthday.  Oh, happy birthday.  Did he invite you down to any performances?  Well, I asked him if he was going to be performing, and he just said, well, it's a little far out, 
[02:41:00]  but he didn't really know, and I said, well, I would just love to come see you.  Where is this?  Where is what?  Oh, you dizzy cunt.  Where are you going to watch him perform?  Kevin!  At the cellar.  I'm at the cellar.  Most nice.  But she was asking when.  I was like, I don't know.  Definitely will be there.  Yeah, because it's kind of far out.  So you're definitely going to meet.  Now, did Jimmy, was this on Pal Talk?  No, this is on MySpace.  On MySpace.  So he's seen your picture and everything. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He actually has my address.  I'm still waiting on my WoW sticker.  Jimmy, what does she look like?  Wait, she's still waiting for her WoW sticker, Jimmy.  I never, oh.  Yeah, I'm going to get my pictures taken for my birthday.  Well, you didn't tell me your name, so I don't know what your name is.  You didn't tell me your MySpace name.  Melissa.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's cute.  Yeah, but I'm getting my nudies done for my birthday, and I wanted to take them with WoW stickers.  Right.  Oh, man.  Yep.  All right.  Diggity, diggity.  You might have to send a notice to Steve at FoundryMusic.com. 
[02:42:00]  Who do you get WoW stickers from?  Um, I haven't had any yet.  No, I'm asking you all back, sir.  Who do you get them from?  Who do we, because people don't have WoW stickers.  No, I don't know.  All right.  I hope, uh...  Hey, Lil, I'm sorry you've got to sit through all this.  If it was up to me, it would just be you and me chatting.  And I'd be laying on the bed as you smoked and drank your coffee.  Send a self-addressed stamp envelope.  Oh.  Dirty pig.  What?  A send a what?  A self-addressed?  I get nervous.  What the hell did you send a self-fuck to South Carolina?  Wow, did you fuck that up. 
[02:42:30]  I know, but you know what I meant.  Yeah.  S-A-S-E.  The address is on opianthony.com, Melissa.  We've got to go.  Jimmy.  Thank you so much.  All right.  I certainly hope line two was, um...  I know you hung up on him, but I hope that was not a news report, and thank God he's a comedian.  Oh, Bill Burr.  Bill Burr killed in California this weekend.  Like, what happened?  I looked at it real quick and was like,  What happened to Billy?  Oh, yeah.  He's a comic.  Well, this one says Jim killed this weekend.  Jim killed this weekend.  Oh.  Steven Hackensack.  You're on the Opian Anthony Show.  How did it happen?  Hey, boys.  What's going on? 
[02:43:00]  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Wanted to tell you, long-time listener.  Dude, you killed this weekend at the Stress Factory.  Oh, thank you.  That's it, man.  I just want to punch out on that.  Thank you.  You called for that?  That was a good enough reason.  Dude, he's awesome, man.  We already know that, though.  Who opened for you?  All right.  That was me, Rich Franchese,  and Vinnie Brand and Julian.  Good old Rich.  All right.  We're going to take a break and regroup and get the show going.  I know what you're wondering.  What's the bouncer doing on stage?  Yeah.  Nope.  Wasn't thinking that at all, actually.  Just thought, here's the next guy. 
[02:43:30]  Okay.  I love when comics automatically, like, they have to, like, make up for what they think  you're thinking.  Like, I know.  You're wondering, what's the bouncer doing on stage?  No?  You're kind of like the same size as my friend.  I know what you guys are thinking.  Like, DJ Hazard used to go, I know you guys are thinking I look like a Nicaraguan game  show host.  And you're like, no.  What the fuck that means, you cokehead? 
[02:44:00]  Don't I look like a mix between...  No.  Yeah.  Douche and bag?  Yes, you do.  You guys are looking at me like if Oliver North and Barney Rubble had a baby.  No.  I'm looking at you like now you're 20 minutes is 12 minutes, so you have to fuck over there  and clean up your mess.  When they're doing crowd work and they keep, they try to, like, riff on a crowd.  And this guy's going, hey, get me out of here.  And this guy's going, hey, where's that one coming from?  And this guy's going, like, hey, look at him.  No one is thinking that.  No one.  You're not rapid firing, you fucking hacks.  Who do they think they are, Neil Hughley? 
[02:44:30]  Exactly.  That boy can rapid fire.  Fucking comics.  So Lil is from Atlanta.  This is fascinating to me.  You never saw the pal talk?  No.  When have I been in here?  What do I know?  Oh, you haven't been here in a while.  It's not out of the middle.  That's what I know.  You haven't been here in a while.  Okay.  Now I'm going to turn my back on you.  Who flashes?  You know how?  Who's not taking the tits out?  No one's taking them out.  But Lil will not do that because that's for me.  Lil's waiting for me to come there and tongue her ass.  She's at work. 
[02:45:00]  She ain't doing shit.  Oh, that's even better.  Pop one out of the side.  Can't somebody just show a tit?  We have Kevin Smith and Jay in here.  Someone should be up with their fucking...  Don't do it for me.  I can't see the monitor.  Legs.  Well, yeah, then do it for him.  I can see it.  Do it for anybody.  Now you can.  Red rum's on?  Where's red rum?  She's the fucking best one.  She knows the deal.  Just girl at work in the pink.  Just cup it and, you know, take it out.  You're covering my girl, Lil.  Oh, my heat of her ass.  I'm trying to find...  Lil's frozen.  Red rum.  Why can't I find it? 
[02:45:30]  Why is Lil frozen?  Oh, the camera might have frozen.  She's bogan, dude.  Oh, there she is.  God damn it.  I can never find...  Let me see.  Where's red rum?  There she is right there.  Oh, that animal?  She's great.  Oh, all right.  Let's see red line.  Wow, you got all the fucking chicks up.  Good boy.  At a bo...  This isn't Starbucks.  This is savage coffee.  Green cafe?  What the fuck?  It tasted best. 
[02:46:00]  It's a place...  Why would you get coffee from a cafe ever?  I would never do that.  I took a sip and I went,  ah, Starbucks?  Really?  Tastes like it's got water in it.  And then look, it's...  This is these mom and pop places.  This is why you're closed.  Because your coffee is dog shit.  And because you're terrorists.  That's right.  No, there's going to be no radio show  until fucking tits come out.  What do you think of that?  Could somebody please flash Jay Moore?  Fucking scumbag.  All the girls, your cameras are off.  Could somebody please flash Jay?  Of course, it's going to be red rum. 
[02:46:30]  Take your mouth!  Because she's sexy.  Yeah!  She has a lot of nipple rings.  She's a lovely one.  You're a good girl and I would...  Apparently the rest of them are fucking Kiwanis Club members.  Ah, we don't do that no more.  Who was that?  God bless you, miss.  You little pierced, nippled animal.  Oh, she's a dirty one.  Oh, she's taking on both ends.  She'll do two black eyes.  She doesn't give a fuck.  She knows what the fuck...  One in one hole, one in her mouth.  She's in the middle going,  What do you want from here?  She takes a shower. 
[02:47:00]  She usually takes a shower in the morning.  Fuck the shower.  And televises it.  Yeah, but the shower can.  Will she show us her vagina?  Good smoothie.  Is it good?  Yeah, I drank it real fast.  Hey, there's another one.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Go home and take a nice smoothie, Stump.  Oh, yes, she will, actually.  There you go.  Muff.  Ooh, muff shot.  Wow, nice job, honey.  What a tattoo.  Totally shaved.  She's a tattoo that says,  If you lived here, you'd be home by now.  I couldn't get it out. 
[02:47:30]  I couldn't get it out.  I am the fucking...  I keep banging on the plan.  Boy, that's a good one for a cat.  Yeah, but not when I make myself laugh before I finish it.  But sometimes I'll laugh on stage and I'll say to the crowd,  Don't make me laugh, guy.  You know, comics are definitely the audience.  Like, he's just laughing along with them.  Guys, don't make me laugh.  Like, you're just having fun with them.  Fucking frauds.  She won't put her tits away, this one.  Well, who is that one?  Those are big, meaty ones.  Point at the crowd.  This lady knows what I mean.  Yeah, and she doesn't.  No.  She's a dumb whore on a date. 
[02:48:00]  Not even a lady on the fair.  You know what?  Yeah.  We should be promoting clerks, too,  and I'm not looking at all these girls.  Even though Red Rum is great,  where is she from?  I don't know.  I think she's Jersey.  Or New York.  What?  Come on, there you go.  That's my girl.  There it is.  All right, now turn it off.  I got Lil's...  What's her name?  Lil.  Lil.  Lil's got the best boobs in the world.  She does have a nice rack.  She does.  I would eat your ass  till you're head caved in. 
[02:48:30]  And fucking...  Now you know what's gonna happen.  I'm fishhook your face.  Now on Whackbag,  they're all gonna be,  they spent too much time  talking about Powdog.  We don't all have it.  Big A is on the Whackbag?  They all are.  I get degraded on...  It was just awful  the way he grabbed his cock  and he just like...  His whole hand couldn't...  You couldn't pull off a full stroke.  So his thumb stayed stationary  and the other four fingers  just went up, down, up, down, up, down. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, kind of like his thumb  stayed there  and he just kind of wiggled it.  Yeah.  He wiggled it around.  When he came,  he's just the guy...  Big A.  Big A.  Big A,  somebody really sold him out.  Who's Big A?  Big A is a big...  I don't even know  how to describe him.  Just a big dope.  He's a big dolt  and he can't really talk.  He kind of looks like Marty Lang  but he can't talk.  He can't talk.  And what is he?  Comedian or something?  No, he's a cab driver.  Just some cabbie.  Independent cab driver  from the Bronx. 
[02:49:30]  In the Bronx.  And he talks like...  And he has a hard time  saying S-T words.  So we make him do the news  usually on Friday  and the staff writes the news  and every story  has S-T words in it  no matter how bad  you have to cram one in.  And he just...  He's a mess.  So he was on Pal Talk  and apparently he found  a girl in a room  and went into a private room  with her  and it was all taped.  Like you could screen cap it 
[02:50:00]  and get the audio.  She taped the audio  and it's him talking about  I want to...  Stick my dick in your ass  and he's jerking off.  This is why you never  take your dick out  unless you lay it  on some dude's neck.  Never take your dick out.  Somebody will find it.  Like your style, Smith.  You're going to go places.  That's why you get  the first glass of cans  and that sober guy.  Poor Muse. 
[02:50:30]  It's Bump the Coach.  We're going to step aside  and take a break.  We'll continue with  Jay Moore, Kevin Smith.  What was his drug of choice?  His drug of choice  and he was pretty bad  in heroin and Oxycontin.  Yeah, really bad  for about six, seven years.  Why isn't this guy  liking so many more movies?  I say that about myself.  Jesus, what do I...  Guys get shirts.  Guys get shirts. 
[02:51:00]  Don't make a fucking maniac out of him.  Guys get shirts.  Guys get shirts.  Guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of him.  Guys get shirts.  Guys get shirts.  Guys get shirts. 
[02:51:30]  Guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of him.  What a...  California, rest in peace.  Time will take me up, release.  California, show your TV.  What a...  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[02:52:00]  Turn that music down.  Turn that music down.  Holy shit.  Someone else is working the board besides Derek.  Wow, where's Derek?  That no-spilling ass is good, at least with the music.  What a mess of a radio program.  Yeah, to the beat, you all.  O.P. and Anthony.  Jay, I took Vicodin for my tooth about a year ago.  And after the first one I took, I was laying in bed.  The pain completely went away.  And I was laying there going like, oh my God.  I took the bottle and counted how many I had left. 
[02:52:30]  Oh yeah.  And I started thinking, all right, I'll take a half.  This is after one.  It was such a good feeling.  But it makes you itch.  I had Norco for a while.  What's that stuff?  It's synthetic Vicodin without all this stuff that makes your blood thin.  Yeah.  Like if Vicodin's like, Jimmy, you would know this, I guess.  Like Vicodin's like 10% actual like drug and 90% blood thinner.  Filler.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Norco is like 50-50.  Mm-hmm.  So one Norco, like, it's a lot. 
[02:53:00]  It's a lot.  Can you not get a rod on Vicodin then if it's a Vicodin?  No, you can, but you can't come.  And that's why I stopped.  I was like, I have a fucking problem.  Because I'm like, well, if I fuck her at six, then I can take Vicodin all night.  I stay away from that stuff, man.  Yeah.  I had a, the wife had some kind of like thyroid thing she had to have removed.  Not her whole thyroid, but she had a thing in her neck and they gave her Vicodin and she  was taking it as prescribed.  Yeah.  But I guess two weeks into it or something like that, she stopped shitting altogether. 
[02:53:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And it went by and she's not like, well, I'm like a-  It's because you forget to eat.  Not really because she was still eating, but nothing was coming out.  And I'm like a three, four shit a day kind of person because, you know, as much as you  put in, it's not going to come out.  Yeah.  She's like maybe one a day or something like that.  She wasn't shitting for at least close to about four or five days.  Wow.  She started getting real sick and shit.  And we were just like, what do you do?  And I went and got her some fucking enemas, you know, the kinds of, do, and she was like,  I don't want to do this.  I was like, well, drink some prune juice, take some X-Lax. 
[02:54:00]  Nothing was working.  And finally one night she was just like, I feel like I'm dying inside.  I feel like, you know, and I figured maybe it's all backed up and she's getting poisoned  or whatever.  Some blockage.  Total blockage.  We took her to the emergency room in Los Angeles.  Not the one, not like Cedar Sinai, but they got one in Century City that was like, there's  nobody ever there.  It's a place to go if you really want to.  And then they shut it down, which sucked.  So we get in there and the guy throws her up on the table and whatnot.  And he takes a look in and he's just like, you're severely impacted. 
[02:54:30]  Impacted.  So the dude had to, she'll be so pissed I told the story, but this is the kind of thing  that'll keep you off drugs.  Dude had to go in there with a long metal-like shovel.  Oh, Jesus.  And dig out impacted people matter.  It was, she was just so like mortified.  Water wouldn't do it like a colonic?  No, they tried.  Man, she tried that enema thing at home, but it was, it was bad, man.  And she was just like.  And it was because of Vicodin?  Because of Vicodin.  If you look at the, at the, you know, the side effects, one of them is. 
[02:55:00]  May need shovel to shit.  Pretty much.  Pretty bad scene, man.  Right then and there, I'm just like, any interest I had in that is, God.  It's done.  Wow.  Hey, is Lil on MySpace?  Tell her to get my friend on MySpace.  I'm done with this fucking pal talk because I, I'm like, I'll, I can't take it anymore.  Oh, pal talk?  All these hellas on pal talk, I'm on MySpace or go to jmore.com.  But nobody writes for free.  Remember that I need, I need naked photos.  Do you have a MySpace account?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone got into it. 
[02:55:30]  We talked about that too last time and, and, uh.  Read my little blog called MyCrack.  Kevin wasn't, uh, hip on it.  I was not on MySpace and then I finally got on.  It's fucking nuts how predictive it is.  I'm having sex with my wife going, I wonder if that's really Ben Roethlisberger.  Like, literally that happened.  That's when you're sitting there going like, why am I bothering, wasting my time having sex  when I could be friend approving right now?  Yeah, right now.  Why am I going on Kevin and Bean when I could just send out a bulletin that my movie's opening?  That's, that's the thing that I find amazing about it. 
[02:56:00]  Like, you got, I'm up to 26,000 friends and it's like, you send out one bulletin, boom,  those people are covered.  And then they send it to other people.  But you have a viewer skew too.  Yeah.  But it's even, I think it's even more of a blanket than a viewer skew.  It's just, cause you're hitting people that were like, oh, you got a website I never knew.  And I've been like on the web for 10 years now.  It's easier too, cause you send out a bulletin instead of putting like a sticky on the top  of your website that not everybody's going to read.  They want to get right to the, you suck part of the fucking website.  Right to the, you know, Kevin ain't as good as he used to be. 
[02:56:30]  Well, we don't got that on my website anymore.  No.  No, you charge, the moment you charge like two bucks to join, it's, it immediately cuts  down on the amount of people who will just jump on and be like, fuck you and misspell  fuck.  Those people go away.  Cause two bucks is too much to say fuck you.  That's a great idea.  Some websites ought to.  Give the money to charity.  It's all good.  And just get the trolls out of there.  Some websites ought to, uh, think about that.  Maybe we should try it.  Some $35 per post.  $35.  By the way, a post, that better be some important shit, man. 
[02:57:00]  By the way, what happened with Bobby during the break?  What was that about?  He was playing no homo again?  He came in with his pants around his ankles and a robe.  He was wearing a robe, right?  Bobby the intern.  Like he was Bob Shepard.  No.  Being gay.  Bobby.  No.  Pulling out my butt.  He thought a robe, the big Yankee robe that somebody gave us.  Frosty.  Frosty gave it to us.  He thought that was going to cover up him being naked.  Like we wouldn't think, because he had a robe on, he was plotting something. 
[02:57:30]  Bobby, pull down your pants.  Where's the coffee I sent somebody for?  Uh, Shortsgate.  And he tried to get Jay, and Jay just moved and did like some sidestep fucking wrestling move.  And you just lost it.  Your robe flipped open.  Your flaccid little dick flicked around a little bit, and then you ran out of here.  You have a small dick.  Because Jay made you look like an ass.  And you're uncircumcised.  Ew, are you unclipped?  Show us.  What?  Come on.  Why would the mic work?  Show us.  Why would the mic work? 
[02:58:00]  Show us your dick.  The reason why.  Show us your dick.  The reason why.  Show us your dick.  Or go home for the day.  Show us your dick.  But get away from Mr. Smith.  Yeah, please.  Yeah, he's a big stone.  Yeah, he's a big stone.  Yeah, he's a big stone.  No, not by me.  Right there.  Behind Jimmy.  No, right by me.  There's a lot of sharp corners in this room.  Right next to Jay.  Right next to Jay.  Yeah, we don't want it.  I'm getting away from you.  Don't put it.  I'm not tears.  I'll give you a fair warning.  Don't come any closer.  Oh, I got nothing right now.  And that's not...  You're not supposed to have anything.  They're all guys, stupid.  Don't even come a...  Stop trying to fluff it up. 
[02:58:30]  Don't come any closer.  He's trying to fluff.  How are you fluffing?  A bunch of guys.  Stop fluffing.  Yes, you made yourself very clear.  That's a very fair warning.  You're awful blue undershorts.  What the fuck are you wearing?  What are those undershorts?  They're boxer briefs.  Ew.  But they're blue and they're stupid.  They look like underoos.  They really do.  They're Hayden's boxer briefs.  It looks like Superman underoos.  He's a superhero.  Faggot man.  It doesn't even clear the bottom of his bag.  His fucking helmet doesn't clear his bag. 
[02:59:00]  Is it on top?  Dude, look.  I was just trying to get...  You have infant cots.  What is that thing?  Why is the tip of your dick like a black man?  It's purple, right?  And why did he yell no homo?  You did not.  Nah, this is what I want you to do next.  What do you want?  I want you to pull...  No one's going to get up.  No one's going to rush you or charge you.  I want you to pull your pants down on your ankles.  And I want you to hold your ankles like you're getting fucked in prison.  There's no homo. 
[02:59:30]  That's no homo.  No homo.  That's no homo, right?  What if I want to run for office later on?  Yeah, that's going to happen.  You'll have the Chelsea vote.  Should you say run for office?  Nothing on that.  Thanks, Kev.  I thought you said Chelsea like as in Clinton.  Oh, no.  That's it.  Look, he's still got...  Look how his dick is perched.  Let's go.  You like no homo.  Let's go.  His dick looks like Hitchcock with that little fucking head and the big neck.  That's what his balls are.  Come on, take him out.  It's all right.  It was all right.  I showed it.  Everything is...  Let's play Cock or Sack. 
[03:00:00]  You show me a little piece of your dick or your ball bag.  I've got to guess which one it is.  You ever play that game?  No, I've never played that.  But you've got to play with your eyes closed and touch your tongue to it.  Oh, you can get this.  Don't look yet until it's ready.  This is the gayest game.  All right, come here.  Look at this.  The fuck is he playing?  Is that Cock or Sack?  That's got to be Sack, huh?  Wrong, brother.  See, you've got to get good at it.  You scrunch it up, make it look like Sack. 
[03:00:30]  Should I try?  Yes.  Oh, look, he wants to play.  He wants to fucking play.  He wants to play Cock or Sack.  Holy shit.  Or, you know what you can do is you just grab your ball bag and make your fingers close  around it and just make it look like a big peach.  You want me to...  Okay, I'll do that.  I don't want you to do anything.  Yes, you do.  All right, you want me.  There's even Chad Cadero over there.  You want me to do that?  There's way too much scrote in this room, man.  There really is.  Why are you turning around?  Oh, my God. 
[03:01:00]  Turn around for pal talk.  What the fuck is that?  Now, show Kevin Smith your brains.  I have no interest.  No interest.  Yo, great.  Now, go wash your hands.  Fucking alien on Menagerie.  How bad do you want to just snap it with your finger?  Really good.  Just flick.  Fucking Star Trek pilot villain head.  No homo, right?  No homo.  No homo.  Wash fucking hands.  The reason before when I was trying to get you, what was bad about it, Anthony always  says everyone's afraid of Opie.  You yelled at me and that's what threw me off. 
[03:01:30]  I was just so startled.  I yelled at you because anybody that comes past the corner of this gets yelled at.  Anthony knows.  Period.  Well, I know, but how much attention do you need?  Wolf would like to know.  I like a lot of attention.  Obviously.  Obviously.  Have you ever been blown by a transvestite?  Uh, no.  Why not?  You're missing out.  I guess Jimmy's fucking hot.  The Asian ones are fucking hot.  I don't know if I've ever met a transvestite.  You don't know?  Well, I don't think I did.  You ever been fucked in the ass by a big clit? 
[03:02:00]  You have.  Wow, you are fucked up.  Have you ever had porno from foundry music where the lactating chick squirts her milk  on another girl's pussy and licks it and then you come all over the carpet and then  you get an instant message from your wife in the next room saying there's a naked girl  in your bed and you go, ah, I'm doing something.  Nobody bets you have.  What the fuck does that mean?  Meaning, this is like...  I'm drawing Kevin my chops.  That was good. 
[03:02:30]  Your improv skills were terrific.  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  Anything like...  No.  See, the beautiful thing is Jay was talking about himself, like that was the joke as he  was relaying...  Right, right.  It's saying that this is me and...  Yeah.  But you don't say it and that's the beauty of that joke.  You said, I bet you have, right.  But then he comes in, you know, that's like, ah, yeah.  I was trying to be sarcastic back, but...  No, you weren't.  No, you weren't.  No, you weren't.  You didn't get it.  You give Jersey a bad name.  Again.  I'm not from Jersey.  Good, I knew a fucking ape like you could never be from the Garden State.  Hit the bricks.  I take Taylor Dane with you, Long Island faggot. 
[03:03:00]  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  That makes it better.  Staten Island is Jersey.  Get out!  Let's go to Tim.  Why does he listen to me?  Let's go to Tim in North Carolina.  That nondescript racial boy walking next to him.  He could be black, he could be white, we don't know what the fuck he is.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson, for real.  Yeah, so he says.  Clerks 2, July 24th.  Well, that's what we got on the phone here.  Tim from North Carolina.  What's up, Tim?  Sorry, Kevin.  He doesn't like marrying with that wicked comeback he came with.  No, I bet you do too, though. 
[03:03:30]  Anyway, never mind.  Sorry.  Uh, Kevin.  You bombed twice in your call so far.  Keep going.  This is the first time I ever bombed, so I don't feel so bad about myself.  Hey, Kevin, listen.  I saw the internet trailer for Clerks 2.  Yes, sir.  Fucking rocks with the Buffalo Bill music in the beginning.  Thank you, sir.  Hilarious.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for continuing to put out quality product.  I'm going to try.  That's very kind, sir.  Have you been listening to the show all morning?  There's a tremendous amount of cock floating around the house. 
[03:04:00]  A lot of dick.  Between the other studio and here.  What is Buffalo Bill music?  We do a bit.  We do a Silence of the Lambs.  Not you, stupid.  In Clerks 2, we do a Silence of the Lambs.  I thought he was going to explain.  Well, you know, let me put a car over.  This is a car on the side of the road story.  Will you tell me what Buffalo Bill music is?  Rub the load.  We do a Silence of the Lambs bit in Clerks 2, where Jay does the whole Silence of the Lambs,  the Buffalo Bill dance.  Is it the same song?  I'm crying over you.  Goodbye, horses.  Goodbye, horses.  I love you, Lazarus. 
[03:04:30]  There it is, sir.  There it is.  Ow!  Where'd you?  That's the line you like.  I like, oh, she's a great big fat person.  That's the greatest line ever, yeah.  I've never seen this before.  I got a card.  I got a card.  You never saw Silence of the Lambs?  I saw it long after it came out.  That was great.  It was like the most overrated thing I'd ever seen.  At one point, the dude is the killer.  He wants to be a woman.  He does this dance by himself.  Oh, this I know.  And he does the talk. 
[03:05:00]  He pulls his cock back.  But I remember, would you?  Would you?  Would you?  That's when he's just helping with the van.  Didn't Jody Parker win for that?  Yes, and so did Hopkins, and so did Best Picture.  And then I watched it like five years after that, and I was like, oh.  I got to get into the guy.  I saw Jagged Edge the other night.  That was fucking awesome.  That's a really great movie.  You've never seen that?  And I would fuck Jeff Bridges' face.  I don't give a fuck.  Who knows it?  That might be the hottest fucking guy.  Brad Pitt's a faggot compared to Jeff Bridges.  What the fuck?  What is wrong with me?  What? 
[03:05:30]  That was good.  That was a movie that had a twist, too, like before twists were very fashionable.  Yeah, that's one of the first twist movies.  Peter Coyote's so unlikable.  You're supposed to like him.  What movies is it?  Jagged Edge.  Jagged Edge.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Ester has one.  This is good.  We're on a topic.  This is good.  Yeah, movies.  Let's try to keep it with me.  I like that.  Let's talk about X-Men.  Who saw X-Men?  I haven't seen it yet.  You didn't go?  No, I want to see it so bad.  We were talking about it before.  Heard it's good.  Heard it's good.  I enjoyed it. 
[03:06:00]  I liked them both.  Who dies?  Who dies?  Who dies?  Who dies?  You don't want to spoil it.  Don't spoil it.  Someone spoiled it for me already.  But there's some big deaths.  Gave me a spoiler already.  Oh, you didn't?  Okay.  Visually, I liked it.  But I didn't like the sport.  I have a theory.  Wait, you didn't like it?  You lost like 300 pounds, right?  No, Kev didn't like it.  Big Kev didn't like it.  Big Kev didn't like it.  What is it?  How much weight did you lose?  300 pounds?  A little more, yeah.  All right.  Why do obese men go see every movie?  They're happy. 
[03:06:30]  Speaking as an obese man.  No, no, no.  I'm talking like 450, 500 pounds.  Like, you're Ralphie's.  This guy.  You're Ralphie's.  Joe McDonald's.  Like, they don't miss a fucking opportunity to sit in the air conditioning on a hot summer  day.  There's not one fucking summer blockbuster.  How many movies have you seen in the last month?  Over a dozen.  Yeah, 15.  You have a fucking problem with intimacy that you go sit in the dark and watch.  No, I don't.  What do you mean?  You know, there's nothing good out to watch.  I like shit movies, too. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  Well, we'll be there.  What have you seen?  You like sports, right?  Yes.  It's the same thing.  It's not because I'm fucking, I've been neutered in my own home.  It's the fucking cooking network 24-7.  But you historically did like sports.  Yes, sir.  How many games did you watch?  It's movies or sports.  Not a dozen.  Not anymore?  No, not a dozen.  Jay's trying to baseball.  I'll do what I want in my house.  Don't get me wrong, Andy.  Oh, man.  Just because she's the breadwinner don't mean I don't get to watch what I want to watch.  How do you deal with that?  It's the best. 
[03:07:30]  Is she cool with it, though?  She brings home all the money and you just kind of...  Wait, who is she and what does she do?  Nikki Cox.  Nikki Cox?  Yeah.  That's your lady?  Nice ass, right?  How'd that happen, sir?  Where'd you guys meet?  How'd that happen?  How'd that happen?  How'd that happen?  On the set of her show.  Kevin Smith's a real good interviewer, so let him interview you for a few minutes.  Let me take the mic.  Let me take control.  So what's...  You're going to have to fill me in, though.  What is the show?  She's on a show called Las Vegas with Jimmy Kahn.  Okay, all right.  Right on.  And Ted Hamilton.  Jimmy Kahn.  And you were on the show?  I did a guest spot on the show when I met. 
[03:08:00]  I had just gotten divorced and she had just left with, you know...  Left with what?  Bob.  How about Tab?  Her ex.  Someone named Jay Moore seems to take in my girl.  And is it somebody...  Is it somebody...  When you say Bob, is it...  Bobcat Goldthwait.  She was with Bobcat Goldthwait.  Yeah, for a long time.  And now, is that...  Now, there's a real how did that happen question.  Yeah.  He likes funny guys, man.  I can give it up for that.  I'm JFK Jr. compared to him. 
[03:08:30]  Your turn.  So, did you...  You're on the comic circuit.  Do you run across Bobcat Goldthwait?  Does he even do shows anymore?  I'm retired.  I don't even do it.  You don't even go out anymore?  I don't have it anymore.  I do it to pay for my mortgage because I have no money.  So, you do go out, though.  He was so good.  You know when I go out is when someone cancels and at the last second they call me in a panic.  Like, can you come to Brea tomorrow?  And I'm like, 100% of the door.  You're kind of fucked, aren't you?  Then I'll do it.  Is that 100% door?  Do you get to walk by with 100% of the door?  85% on Fridays and Saturdays and 100% on Thursdays. 
[03:09:00]  Jay was a pro, too.  He'd come out all sharp dressed and everything.  And the act was really funny.  All these fucking faggots on these boards trying to take shots at me.  Act was really funny.  And then, like...  I was like fucking Ricky Henderson in 88.  Why did you slow it down?  Why don't you do it as much anymore?  I don't love it.  No?  Just fell out of it?  Don't love it.  So now it's all about acting.  I stand on stage for a half hour realizing I'm only half done and I want to scream,  you fucking say something.  Like, still me?  And then, like...  And I still can step on a rock that goes down? 
[03:09:30]  Wow, you really do hate it.  Like, it's like fucking 20 minutes and, like, with each sentence, like, hope this works.  What the fuck?  I hope...  You go see, like, Sheryl Crow in concert and you go, yeah, you know, it makes me happy.  I've seen it before.  Like, a musician, they're like, play the fucking hits.  And then in stand-up, they're like, we don't want to hear that.  Dude, what's new?  You did that dolphin cock story the last time I saw you.  Well, yeah, that's what I talk about on my act.  It's not my fault you come see me every fucking week. 
[03:10:00]  That is a bitch.  It's a comic, man.  So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Go back.  So you're on the show.  It's a great interview.  I'm going to get you focused here.  So you're on the show and you hang out with her for a few days and just like, hey, let's  go out.  All my shit were with her.  Uh-huh.  And I had to act drunk and silly and propose marriage to her.  Oh.  And she told me that she, we made, one of the extras had a really bad haircut and mustache.  And she goes, have you seen my mustaches?  I was like, what? 
[03:10:30]  And she goes, yeah, you're going to think I'm so weird.  I travel with fake mustaches.  And I go, I don't believe you.  And in her purse, she had like five or six like mustaches and beards and merkins.  And that's when you knew she was the girl for you?  And then when I went home that night, when I was changing out of my clothes in my star  wagon, Anthony, is it?  Yes.  The star wagon.  It's a little bigger than your double banger, Jimmy.  Two banger, sir.  Two banger.  Yeah.  Two banger.  And there was a mustache on a piece of stationery.  And she wrote, I think you might need this. 
[03:11:00]  And I was like, all right, that's it.  This is the one.  And then for like three weeks, I didn't lay a glove on her.  Like, I'm not going to be that guy because I forgot to see her.  I wouldn't know what the fuck that meant.  Yeah.  What did it mean?  Like, what did it mean?  What did that call for?  It meant like, it's just nothing.  Just like, we were talking.  Don't you know?  You've been on the boards.  You've been on the boards.  What did it mean?  What does the mustache on the stationery mean?  Like, use this, like, go walk around, wear a fake mustache and have fun.  I have mustaches.  We were talking about mustaches. 
[03:11:30]  And this is a way for me to extend and say hi without.  So you just kind of immediately related to her based on that.  Like, you were like, that chick's funny.  Pretty fucking girl.  Like, she makes me laugh.  Right, right, right.  Like, she's fucking hilarious.  And she got a thing for funny dudes.  Like, she's guy funny.  That's cool.  Why can't I meet a funny girl with a fake mustache?  All some fucking fatos and whores.  She's guy funny.  She'll stick her dick on your neck.  So homo.  She would.  She gives you the fruit basket.  That's cool.  And then she said, if I had a dick, would you let me fuck you with it? 
[03:12:00]  And I said, you?  Yes.  And that's when she said she knew that she would marry me.  She goes, she asked that question all the time.  And the guy's always like, no, see, I can't, nah, nah.  And I was like, yeah.  It's gay.  You?  Like, I'm looking at her.  Going, yeah.  Like, you're a woman, but it's you.  You have a dick.  Yeah.  But that's a guy.  But it's her.  It's not.  It's her.  I'm looking at her.  But it's a real dick, not a strap-on.  No, it's her with a fucking penis.  And I go, I said, like, it's you.  Like, you sitting here, and you have a dick, and we're making out. 
[03:12:30]  Did she always have a dick, or just for a day?  We didn't get that.  You got to.  It's so important.  Not at all.  If she always had a dick.  His point is, it's her.  He's looking at her, and also, it's her, the person, as well.  Yeah.  She has no idea that you would have sucked it first.  Oh, yes, she did.  Because I'd rather suck a guy's dick than make out with him, because I think making out  with a guy is way gay.  It's a little too intimate.  Yeah, but you feel, like, the whisker on your cheek, and then, like, you click teeth, and  then, like, oh, God, he's breathing out through his nose, and then you go, like, where do I 
[03:13:00]  put my hands?  Do I put it on his back?  Do I stroke his hand?  Do I grab his ass?  And then, like, as you're wondering where to put your free hand, you're like, this is  the fucking gayest thing I've ever done in my life.  Like, I'd rather just suck him off and kick him out of my car.  See, the thing is, you shouldn't have to choose.  Both should be options.  That was the worst part about Brokeback Mountain.  It was, like, at the beginning, right at the start where the tent, and it's a little cold,  and he gets in and just spits on his fucking hand and shoves it in his ass. 
[03:13:30]  It was kind of rapey and hot.  Then it's, like, rapey.  That spit in the hand, that, to me, was like, wow, this movie just fucked.  This deserves an Oscar.  It's, like, Jesus Christ.  But then when they start kissing like that by the stairs, that was gross.  It's like the fucking rape ass scene is just kind of, ah, two men.  It's cold out there in the mountain.  They're just doing a little fucking keeping warm.  I like it because Jake Gyllenhaal.  Gyllenhaal.  I want to hear Tom Brokaw say that.  Jake Gyllenhaal. 
[03:14:00]  Jake Gyllenhaal fell off the deck of the Achillevaro.  I want to make love to you, and, like, I think I'm gay.  And Heath Ledger's like, oh, you think I'm gay, you fucking faggot?  I'm like, fuck your ass, you fucking homo fucking faggot.  Yeah, he was offended for, like, two seconds.  And then he rapes his ass and kicks him out of the tent.  And I'm like, it is a love story.  He unbuckled that big Western belt buckle, and you knew it was all over.  You know, like, with the outtakes, like, he probably, he probably, like, fucking choked  him a little with it.  Gyllenhaal, like, why is your sister better than you, and you both, why do you work too 
[03:14:30]  much?  We have, uh, Taylor in Virginia, very upset.  Taylor, what's up?  Listen, all the fucking, like, gay description shit you guys have done over the years is bad,  but Jay just, like, made my skin crawl with the whole fucking teeth clicking and stubble  rubbing.  Teeth clicking.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Why is that so bad?  Like, when you said it, it's like, ugh.  So then you agree with my point.  Taylor.  Please stop.  Congratulations on Idol, by the way.  Yeah, right on. 
[03:15:00]  Now, where are you supposed to?  Soul Patrol.  We get it.  Fucking Michael McDonald wannabe.  Woo!  We're going to have him on, I guess, in a half hour or so.  So, Kevin, what movies have you seen?  Everything.  Like what?  Give us the rundown.  The Lindsay Lohan movie?  I did not see Bad Luck.  That's not an X-Men you didn't like.  I didn't like the story, but visually I thought it was very good.  All right.  I saw Ebert and fucking whoever's not the dead one.  Roper.  He goes, I like Over the Hedge.  I like the colors, the scheming.  And I went, you are a fucking delusional, used to be fat, fuck a black asshole. 
[03:15:30]  Whose mouth looks like a cat's asshole.  Go ahead, Kevin.  You see Over the Hedge?  I did.  I saw that the other night.  Did you like the colors?  No.  Not more than anything else, no.  I liked Over the Hedge.  Did you like Over the Hedge?  Yeah, it was funny.  I like the scheming.  The scheming is not so much.  I think Cars will be huge.  I can't wait to see it.  I think that'll be big.  I mean, I can totally see it because it's Pixar, but so far there hasn't been a trailer 
[03:16:00]  yet that I've been like, oh, that's great.  What's Pixar?  You see...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Someone just hit Jimmy over the head with a shovel.  Did you bring together a pop quiz for Jimmy?  I don't watch fucking cartoon movies.  I don't like them.  Pixar is the definitive movie production house as far as CGI animation goes.  I don't fuck.  I never saw Toy Story.  I'm not interested in that stuff at all.  You know what surprised me?  Having a kid, and he's like three years old, and you watch these movies, The Nemo, The Toy  Story, they're all great. 
[03:16:30]  They're all like really good movies.  The Incredibles was really good.  The Incredibles was pretty tight.  But whenever she yells, I lose my erection.  I don't know.  So what did you want to ask me?  So how long did you really wait, like six weeks before you laid a glove on her?  It was the longest I've ever waited.  Did you let her make the first move?  It kind of was like an instantaneous kapowie.  Kapowie.  I need to pull over.  How long ago was this then? 
[03:17:00]  Almost two years.  Oh, really?  Because you know what?  That show's been on for like two years now.  Four.  Las Vegas has been on for four years.  Jesus.  I find that more amazing than the fact that you're so fucking Nikki Cox.  We don't fuck.  There you go.  So does she.  Until she grows a cock.  I just don't have to watch all that TV, I guess.  I was so destitute, and I was such a degenerate sexually.  I was like, you know what?  I will actually be her friend.  Like, I'm all right with just being her friend. 
[03:17:30]  That's how funny she is.  Oh, you love her.  You love her.  Wow.  Yeah.  You could tell, man.  You'd rather just pal around with her.  Well, not rather, but you'd pal.  If that's all you could have, you'd pal around with her.  She was so hot, I lost my erection the first time we had sex.  After?  I don't know what that means.  After?  I'm trying to fucking process that.  Before?  I've told you guys this before.  I don't remember this story.  We're having sex at the fucking Hotel Bel Air, and I'm looking at her going, this girl  can I possibly, like, we're in front of the fireplace, and there's, like, rose petals on the ground.  Yeah, one of those scenes. 
[03:18:00]  Like, her idea, like, yeah, that'd be nice, have rose petals everywhere.  It's nice, right?  Where do they get a load of me?  Where's Harvey?  And I go, she cannot possibly be any hotter.  And then right when I thought that, she started sucking her thumb, and my dick said, I gotta go.  It's like double A to the bigs.  Like, I didn't know that the fastball could cut like that.  I can't hit this.  Wow.  She started sucking her thumb?  Easy, Anthony. 
[03:18:30]  I don't like that if they haven't outgrown it yet.  It was like, wow, I think this might be like, I might be popping out hot-wise right at this  very moment.  That's it.  It was like, that's the pinnacle.  The pinnacle.  Wow, what'd you say or do?  Eat pussy for an hour.  Yeah.  Not nervous.  You had people come up.  Other people.  That's a great gag when you think you're going to shoot too soon. 
[03:19:00]  You go, you go, you go.  And then you just, you push him up on the bed, and just start going down on him, and  go, cock, knock it off.  Desensitize.  Rub it on the bed a little to get the nerve endings all shot.  And then go back up.  Any other questions, Kevin?  You blow a load in your Rockaway bedding?  I think you got a lot out of him, actually.  Yeah.  Nothing you guys didn't know.  I didn't know about the last story. 
[03:19:30]  You never told the, couldn't get her an erection.  I did.  The thumb thing.  I did.  What about the family?  You meet the family?  Great.  All good people.  It's like my son has a new set of, like, grandparents and aunts and uncles.  You tell them that story?  That look tells me no.  Bum.  Bum.  Don't, babe.  Don't make me love.  Give me a bag of shells.  There's nothing he said that's like, if her parents were listening, they'd be like,  oh, what a disgusting thing.  She's turned on.  Yeah, but he's kept it really, like, respectful. 
[03:20:00]  He kept it right there.  Kept it right there.  He's in love.  She's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, totally.  Big Kev, what other movies?  Poseidon, which I didn't like.  I liked the original better.  Yeah, it was tough.  The boat's going sinking.  I didn't know I could even do Dreyfus until now.  That's a good Dreyfus, man.  I liked Mission Impossible 3.  I thought it got a bad rap.  I agree.  I liked the movie.  Totally watchable.  Kevin, he's fucking, like, just so crazy, right?  Tom Cruise.  I don't know.  I've interviewed him once. 
[03:20:30]  Like, I only met him that one time.  I interviewed him for Arena Magazine.  Oh, okay.  And he, you know, he's very, he knows how to talk to people.  He's always like this.  You know better than you.  How was he when you were working with him?  He laughs at everything, man.  But doesn't it, like, when he talks, doesn't it make you feel like everything you're saying  isn't interesting?  When I worked with him, I felt like when guys talk about a college coach that's straightened 
[03:21:00]  their act out so they can get drafted, that's how I felt about him and acting and me.  Like, he took a vested interest in pulling me aside and saying, this is more important  than you think it is.  If something doesn't feel right, you have to speak up.  You have to be nice to people.  Fold your clothes up for the wardrobe ladies and hang them back up.  Wow.  He gave you the lecture, man.  The lesson.  And could you fold mine while you're at this?  No.  He was, like, one of the single greatest human beings I had ever met in my life.  And I'm talking 13 hours a day, every day, for three and a half months. 
[03:21:30]  You know, Jerry Maguire is an $80 million movie.  You shoot, like, a page a day.  Yeah.  You sit around Sun Devil Stadium on a golf cart going, so.  And he'd be like, now, your dad, his brother Bobby, is he still sick?  And he, like, told him that two months ago.  And you're like, what the fuck?  Yes, he remembers odd details and whatnot.  Really?  And whatnot, yeah.  Is your dad still racing cars?  Is he at Watkins Glen?  Ask your dad with the turn he took at Watkins Glen, because I always had a trouble on that  turn, on turn two.  Your dad's in Modified Spec Racers.  I'm like, yeah, but you're Tom Cruise, you weirdo. 
[03:22:00]  Wow.  You don't need to know any of this.  Have you ever seen him again since that period?  No.  No?  But I've seen Walkin' again since Suicide Kings, and it always takes him, like, a minute  to remember that I'm someone he knows.  For real?  But I always call him Elvis, and I think that confuses him.  I go, hello, Elvis.  How's the king of rock and roll, Elvis?  And he goes, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey.  How are you?  As long as I get a premiere, he started at the Copland premiere, he was just like, huh? 
[03:22:30]  He doesn't remember you?  What does he remember?  You did Suicide Kings.  Yeah, but he doesn't remember.  Great movie.  He doesn't remember.  No?  You movie guys don't remember.  I've been going to Pacino's house for play dates.  It's been good.  Play dates?  Yeah, he's got the twins from Beverly D'Angelo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I realize what a fucking faggot I sound like. 
[03:23:00]  You know what happened going to Pacino's house?  Hey, they wanted to throw a pop culture quiz together for Jim.  Yeah.  You in today, Jim?  I'll pass it.  Believe me.  All right.  No, you're wrong.  Kevin, you know what happens here?  By the way, Clerks 2, July 21st.  21st.  Very good.  Very good, Tom Cruise.  Groomsman, July 12th.  Lucky Louie, June 11th.  Who cares?  I saw the preview for that.  You didn't like it?  I loved it.  Thank you.  I saw that preview.  I've seen a few previews.  All right.  Funny, man.  That looks good.  I like...  It should be Lucky Jimmy.  It should be.  Oh.  When we did... 
[03:23:30]  Clerks played at the New Directors New Films Festival, like here in New York, it's like  a sister festival to the New York Film Festival.  That dude, Louis C.K., had a short film in front of it called Ice Cream, which was really  funny.  Yeah, his short film is supposedly great.  I've never seen it again.  But he looks good on that show.  Those spots have been good.  What if they shoot it in this weird way where it looks like an old sitcom?  Yeah.  I like that.  You guys made Gawker Stalker today.  Kevin Smith and Jay Moore.  40 West 57th Street, May 30th, 2006 at 8 a.m. 
[03:24:00]  8 a.m.  That's creepy.  Near my office building, going to work, Opie and Anthony outside, hanging out with Kevin  Smith and Jay Moore outside.  No boo while they were on air.  Kevin had a few Clerks 2 shirts in hand.  You did?  No.  No.  No.  I was like, I'll bag it.  And we were in front of No Boo.  They're liars.  What are you, Malibu?  But it's on Gawker Stalker.  What other movies, Big Kev?  Have you seen?  I saw Clerks 2, but I signed a confidentiality agreement.  Good, man.  So I can't tell you how good I thought it was.  Oh, you did.  Good, man.  Why are you giving us the thumbs up, then?  I'm not doing anything.  Were you ever... 
[03:24:30]  Who dies?  Were you ever really going to do Fletch, or was that just all...  I was going to do Fletch.  Then it just kind of went away.  Let's do it, man.  What are you thinking about the...  I would like to say, they're so tight with who they want to cast in the lead.  What are you going to do with Ben Affleck?  You're going to throw me away?  No, no, no.  Yeah, how's Ben doing?  Ben's so good.  He's over in Boston shooting a movie.  He's directing a movie.  He was rushed to the hospital over the weekend.  Really?  For what?  Migraine or something?  AIDS.  That's a big story today in the gossip column.  You guys were talking about it, but yeah.  What do you think about Superman? 
[03:25:00]  You know, I'll see it.  I'm happy to see it, but I looked more forward to that X-Men movie than Superman.  Oh, jeez.  Kev's shaking his head.  No.  I'm not looking forward to it at all.  No?  Why not, sweetie?  Damn it.  Because I think the premise is kind of hokey, and...  Is it?  I'm not going to hate Superman.  You're a fucking...  Let's be a bag of your ass.  Who's going to believe a guy can fly?  Not that part of it, ass.  The fact that it picks up after Superman 2, and that he's been in space for five years,  and that Lois has a kid, and it's just... 
[03:25:30]  Basically, they're taking off...  Wow.  This jump-off point at the end of Superman 2.  I just thought it was...  Nope.  It's a spiritual sequel, they're saying.  So it takes off after Zod?  But I'll see it, man.  That dude, Bryan Singer, I think, directs the action well.  The movie's worth it to see Spacey play Luthor.  It starts off with him flying out of a chair.  That overrated...  Oh, God, he's terrible, man.  Let's say hi to Tom in Kentucky.  Tom, what's up?  How you doing, boys? 
[03:26:00]  Hey there, Tom.  I was wondering if Kevin Smith has ever heard that Alice in Chains parody by John S.  John S. in Hartford, I believe, right?  I think so.  Yeah, he does Alice in Chains down in a hole, sung by James Gump.  It is fucking hilarious.  Yeah, we could play that going into break, I guess.  What we haven't heard in a long time is the...  Yeah, I like the other one.  This one's all right, but Jesus fuck.  How about we do a twofer?  A twofer.  I think we played this on regular radio, because it's kind of safe. 
[03:26:30]  I like the other one.  Which one do you want?  It rubs the lotion on his skin.  It rubs the lotion.  The one from the Broadway musical, a version of Silent Clams.  The musical one is good, but the parody is better.  No, it's not.  Kaplan Brothers.  That's the one I want to hear.  All right.  Yours sucks, Tom from Kentucky.  Thanks for nothing.  Don't fuck yourself.  I'm going to sign a fire.  I kind of like the John S. version.  Well, we don't say it's bad, but we'd like the other.  They hate their fucking fans.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  Billy Connolly, I think he's coming back. 
[03:27:00]  Billy Connolly had us laughing our asses off.  When we're done with the show.  Huh?  Cox says he's human pot.  Yeah.  It kind of does make you feel like you're buzzed when he's around you.  That's the kind of thing that game says.  I like that.  Oh, Billy Connolly, he's human pot.  He sat here, and the way we were treating our listeners during commercials, I think.  I don't even think it was on the air.  He turned and went, you yell at your fans.  You fucking hate them.  It's fucking brilliant. 
[03:27:30]  They just keep coming back.  It's amazing.  I've never fucking thought of doing this.  And the thing that amazes me is that they keep coming back.  They keep coming.  You fucking hate them.  It's like, yeah.  Yeah, we hate them.  That big, sweet smile.  All right.  We'll play.  Put the fucking bullshit.  Buffalo Bill Cody thing going now, where he's got that little, like, tuft of hair.  Looks like someone should shoot him playing cards.  Remember John Wesley Harding shot a man for snoring?  Just for snoring.  We'll tell you about it in this Time Life book.  How about we do this? 
[03:28:00]  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Yeah.  The Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  And then coming back, we have a big surprise.  We do?  Well, we do.  What?  It's called a tease, Opie.  What is it?  Well, when they come back, they'll hear the big surprise.  Well, what is it?  It wouldn't be a surprise, then.  From you?  More tits.  Yes.  This girl never stops with her tits.  She's just a hero.  This is the Kaplan Brothers.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's cold.  It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose. 
[03:28:30]  And when it's done, there's one more thing, a simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them it instead of by their names.  Mister, please, no more abuse. 
[03:29:00]  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  I'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying now, you big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining.  So, right down before I jam a boss, right down your fucking throat. 
[03:29:30]  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed.  Precious, she's down here, you piece of shit. 
[03:30:00]  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you up, there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell bad girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket. 
[03:30:30]  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you if you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's  pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I love listening to Opie and Anthony when I'm having a tubby.  I get clean, I laugh at the funny jokes, and I play with my submarines. 
[03:31:00]  Sometimes Uncle Henry gets in the tub with me.  He makes me play with his submarine.  It's Opie and Anthony!  I'm a happy play.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:31:30]  Kevin Smith in the studio.  Clerks 2 opens up July 21st.  Eight-minute standing ovation and cons.  That was nice.  Can.  Con.  Con, can.  Con.  Whatever.  Nate, it's getting a nice reception so far.  A very nice reception.  I like to downplay it.  Gone.  You like to downplay it a little bit?  Yeah.  You know, you send people in there with expectations and then they could be crushed. 
[03:32:00]  Forget that.  I think...  I say the movie's bad and I dare you to...  We're all excited to see it.  I can't wait.  Can we get an advanced copy possibly?  Yeah, you guys can totally see it.  I mean, I'll sign stuff.  I won't talk.  I want screening for you guys.  Now we got prints.  Like, the movie's done.  So we got prints.  Yeah, I mean, I won't, you know, talk like and tell everyone like in breakup with Jennifer  Aniston.  Did you see it?  You know, that they don't get back together in the end.  They don't.  Now they see each other on a bus.  Huh?  Thanks.  What? 
[03:32:30]  They see each other on a bus, but they don't get back together.  One of them is doing like a bus tour announcing thing.  Thanks.  Yeah.  They don't get back together.  I auditioned for it.  Did you?  Did you really?  Yeah.  Dude, talk about Lucky Louie, man, because that really intrigues me.  Well, that one I auditioned for and got, and the same casting director that did that  did the breakup, and they thought it would be a good idea to bring me in for a director's  read while I was out there shooting the pilot.  And wow, did I bomb.  What part did they want you for?  I don't know.  It was like one of his friends, a real estate agent.  Oh, Bateman plays that, right? 
[03:33:00]  Jason Bateman, I think.  Don't know, but I certainly was not going to play it after my read.  What did you do?  Hey.  Oh, my fucking face was in the page the whole time.  Yeah, it was like just doing a fucking, I was actually just like reading it like you'd  read a paper out loud.  Yes, and it says here that I have to show emotion.  It was abominable.  Taylor Hicks is going to be calling in at 11 o'clock.  The winner of American Idol, yes.  Where were we?  The dude with the gray hair?  Yeah, the dude with the gray hair. 
[03:33:30]  I don't watch the show, but everyone's going like, the gray hair one.  Yeah, the gray hair dude.  The Michael McDonald guy with the Joe Cocker voice.  Yeah.  We got a pop culture quiz in front of us.  All right, good, good.  I like attacking Jimmy with these pop culture things.  Yeah, but then he turns around and gets us back with some...  Oh, with obscure questions about Sabbath that he thinks everyone should know?  That's what's important to me.  Everyone should know this.  These are questions everyone should know.  Can I have a pencil, E-Rock, please?  Yeah, here he goes.  He's starting to write his questions already.  Thanks, bud. 
[03:34:00]  This is how he gets us back in the end.  No, because you've got to pay attention.  I'm listening.  All right, you want to start?  Good.  What band's most recent chart-topping album was Stadium Arcadium?  Stadium Arcadium is fucking...  Can this be like Family Feud, where I can get ready to steal?  Yeah, you could steal.  This has got to be... 
[03:34:30]  Really?  Of course.  I would never know.  He never would have gotten that.  Why would I?  Give it away, give it away now.  That's the worst.  Great.  He picks a 20-year-old song.  I don't like him.  I was at a radio show where they put together Dr. Seuss words from books and read out Chili  Pepper lyrics.  Chili Pepper.  And the colors had to pick which one was which.  That's a good idea.  No one got it.  I'm not a fan of the Chili Pepper, so even if I did know that, I'd block it out like a  childhood.  All right, let's go to the next one.  It's just you can't avoid it.  They've got that album cover up everywhere. 
[03:35:00]  They really hoard the hell out of that album.  Yeah, see?  If you open your eyes...  It's like Cahuenga Pass, and you're like, this is your marketing scheme?  Me on my way home?  Do you live out there?  Do you live out there?  Where do you live?  Lake Hollywood behind...  Lake Farham, Lake Hollywood.  I live up in Hollywood Hills, like right off of Franklin, off Outpost.  Yeah, maybe we should get together.  We should hang out, sir.  I got a kid.  We could have play dates like Pacino.  Yeah, but my daughter's like six.  You guys got to talk about Fletch.  She could be seven.  That's going to happen.  We could talk about how Fletch will never have him for either of us.  All right, Anthony.  If you're talking about how with me as your star, I guarantee you can get $250,000 to 
[03:35:30]  make that movie.  I'm a filch.  I'm so out of the fucking picture.  What is the name of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's newborn baby?  Bubbles?  That's Shiloh.  Close.  Have you noticed Maddox has never changed shape or size?  He's like 11 and he's still in the front of the shopping cart?  Maddox is the kid with the mohawk, right? 
[03:36:00]  No, Greg Maddox from the...  Yeah, he's like the exact same...  Like, he's got the same haircut and the same...  Like a valve didn't open up on him.  Oh, Jesus.  Did anybody see on the TV the thing on primordial dwarves?  Oh, primordial dwarves.  And when was 43, she kind of looked like Patty.  But she had bug teeth that, like, blocked her speech.  Like, she was... 
[03:36:30]  How are you laughing?  You weren't there, man.  Why am I laughing?  What the hell are you on?  Are they the progeria kids?  They look like that, but...  But she was old?  Because she was 43.  They don't live to, like, 30.  And there was, like, a 16-year-old girl and her 10-year-old brother.  And they're walking their 20-month-old nephew up the patio stairs.  And he starts to go down. 
[03:37:00]  And he's like...  It's like they're walking Mighty Joe Young.  He's just walking into the garden.  And it's 20-month-old...  It's like a 20-month-old, like, bald.  You know, like, when they still walk with gay arms?  And they go up the stairs.  And this kid goes like, whoa.  And they're like, ah!  Like, they're going down. 
[03:37:30]  And they're like, shit, they're like 16.  That's horrible.  Oh, fuck them.  Maury Povich has them on all the time.  What are they?  They're primordial dwarves.  Primordial dwarves.  The little people.  There are 100 of them.  And Maury has to make something of it.  So he had them in his office.  But they were all hiding.  And Maury tries to play it off like he's playing.  Come here.  Where are you, Cindy?  Where are you?  Oh, you're in my drawer.  And he opens up, like, a pencil drawer. 
[03:38:00]  And one of them is in there.  And he's like, where's Katie?  Where are you?  She's up on his bookshelf, like a book fucking end.  Holding up the books.  One was in the garbage pail.  And it just looked right.  Yeah, perfect.  Like, oh, my God.  Just these awful little things.  It's one of the greatest shows you can watch.  And when the kids start crying, Maury is great.  Because no matter what happens, you know, it's like, tomorrow, the tragedy of burn victims.  And we'll have them on. 
[03:38:30]  And, you know, they make fun of you all the time.  But let me tell you something.  And he gets all close.  You are beautiful to me.  And the audience starts clapping.  And he's just like, and we have.  And they'll bring out some, like, boy band that hasn't been relevant for 18 years onto the stage.  Bring them out.  They're going to sing just for you.  And she's sitting there with that.  Hot property.  Hot property.  I'm going to make a stand-up reference.  I'm like, I make Dennis Miller look like a fucking.  I got nothing. 
[03:39:00]  Look at them big, wide, surprised eyes.  All right, let's.  It's their hit song, Where'd My Lashes Go?  All right, we're on number three for Jimmy.  What HBO Western series.  We were on the air that whole time?  Yeah, yeah.  I swear to God, I thought we were.  Oh, there's no commercials here.  What are you kidding?  All right, let's go to three.  Cut your bridges with primordial love.  The point of the whole thing was the 43-year-old had buck teeth.  They came down to here, like, she had, like, the size of your teeth.  But bigger, like, Barry Katt's teeth.  Big fucking Elway teeth. 
[03:39:30]  And she's, like, this big.  And they bring the 16-year-old over to her house.  Like, see, it's, like, normal.  It's great.  Like, look how great.  Like, that's the last thing she wants to see is fucking stalker Patty and Bugs Bunny combined.  And she goes, come see some of my things.  And she takes her to the house, and she's, like, a pack rat.  And the 16-year-old bugs out and runs out of the house in the yard.  And they look up.  She looks up with her teeth and goes, I think you got a little claustrophobic.  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.  Deadwood. 
[03:40:00]  Jimmy, you're up.  Oh, you knew that.  You said HBO, and you said Western.  Western series.  Deadwood.  Okay, we'll give them one.  I make my business to know it's on that fine network.  Are you cheating?  No, I don't need to cheat to know it's on that excellent, best network there is.  Okay, who was the American Idol runner-up?  This year?  That fucking twat McPhee.  That Catherine McPhee.  All right.  How do you not know who that bitch is?  Taylor went home to Alabama, and they have, like, the whole day for him.  You see that? 
[03:40:30]  There's, like, 30,000 people.  Yep.  And then she goes home to fucking Sherman Oaks.  It's like her family in the driveway.  No one cares.  They had to go to a high school.  There's, like, a sign at the smokehouse, like, McVie.  From the radio, you can see me pointing.  I saw you pointing.  We saw it.  What character does Hugh Jackman play in X-Men?  Come on, man.  Wolverine.  Come on, man.  Wolverine.  I know pop culture.  Like you know.  I do.  Why do you wear the thing after you wake up?  Because I still need to breathe, don't I?  What is the name of the new PlayStation system being released this fall? 
[03:41:00]  The Get a Girlfriend Faggot.  I don't fuck with that nonsense.  I don't know.  PS3?  Hit this PS3.  There you go.  You're on fire today.  I'm four out of six.  I know all about it.  These are bad questions, though.  Who wrote these?  They're great questions.  Who wrote them?  By the way.  Oh, fucking Travis.  Did she?  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a quick question.  Sabbath's third album. 
[03:41:30]  Same as the first tone.  No.  Like, same sounding as the first tone.  No, they're very different.  Each album had its own sound.  Oh, they are not.  It's the same.  Who are you?  Like Sabbath 3.  Yeah, we get it.  Death Music.  Oh, you're so scary.  No, they're very good, though.  No, they're not.  They were original.  They've been stolen from, but they were very original.  Okay.  There's no James gang.  Exactly.  Who's replacing Katie Keurig on the Tonight Show?  On the Today Show?  Yes.  Hopefully, Heather Nussbaum.  Wow.  That was an obscure poll. 
[03:42:00]  Have I had an open mic night in Hackensack in 88?  Is Brian McFadden hosting?  Heather Nussbaum.  Wait a minute.  Who's replacing Katie Keurig?  I already know this, because she's going to...  Fuck.  I don't know.  Who?  Meredith Vieira.  Actually, I had no idea.  I didn't know that.  Do you guys think Kanye West is as gay as I do, maybe?  Do you think?  I haven't really seen him about it.  I don't know.  This comedy recently ended its eight-year run. 
[03:42:30]  At the bathhouse?  I'll look for him at the bathhouse.  Oh, he's in the eight-year run.  Oh, when you see him in the interview, he's like, well, you know, we want to do it for  the music.  It's kind of like Louie Guthman.  Comedy ending its eight-year run on...  Oh, my friends.  Will and Grace.  Did let him...  I mean, let him with them.  I mean, I would just sit there.  Travis has proven our point.  I'm good.  That Travis writes awful fucking...  No, but why would Jimmy know Will and Grace?  Like, I would... 
[03:43:00]  Like, the Pixar thing is perfect.  That's exactly his speed.  That would have to be multiple choice for me.  This...  Any fucking retard can get these.  Did you really know Will and Grace?  Any retard.  Fucking lie to me.  We got history.  No, I was on...  I did Leno with them.  They were very nice to me.  Keith Robinson and your fucking cowboy jersey.  This is one I couldn't get because I don't know anything about sports.  But who are the final four teams in the NBA playoffs?  It's got to be the...  Dick fucks suck cock.  I know it's the Heat and the Suns.  They're not playing each other.  I'm aware of that.  I'm just trying to think of who the Heat was beating up on yesterday. 
[03:43:30]  God damn it.  Somebody else in the East.  Black.  Fuck.  Not the Clippers.  Shit.  Clippers in the East.  Wait, no, no, no.  They're out of it.  The Suns in Dallas in the West.  And in the East, it is...  Let me think.  The Coleon family in the East.  And there is the Peace.  And there is the Peace.  Wait a minute.  It's Miami.  I'm just going through the East.  I was watching the game last night.  Last night?  Yeah, fuck.  I can't remember who...  I watched the...  If I go to all the teams, I'll do...  I'll keep it with the Mavericks and the Pistons. 
[03:44:00]  They're animals anyway.  Oh, the Pistons.  Oh, the Pistons.  All right.  Did you really have Chinese food poisoning when you missed that day?  I don't know if it was Chinese food, but I was shitting and vomiting.  There was something going around.  A bug, too, which I might have had.  I don't know.  It's called germs.  It's going around all the time.  I'm very clean, man.  I've had...  Very clean?  Girls take dumps on your chest.  No, don't believe everything.  Why waste it on the chest?  What am I, a fucking...  What am I, a single-A player?  I'm in the majors, kiddo.  Right in the mouth, please.  On the chest.  What fantastic...  What do you do when you order a steak?  Throw it on the floor and look at it? 
[03:44:30]  Hollywood types.  You waste everything.  What Fantastic Four actress is hosting the MTV Movie Awards?  Oh, fucking Alba.  Jessica Alba.  He did fine.  He did...  He got all...  I think 8 out of 10, yeah.  This bit's over.  Thanks, Travis.  You stink, Travis.  I know about pop culture.  You're the fucking worst.  No, you don't.  Last time we did this, he had, like, three right.  Not a half right.  That's fucking Kindergarten Jeopardy.  This isn't right.  The Black Eyed Peas...  Kindergarten fucking Jeopardy. 
[03:45:00]  Whatever you guys want to know, I'll tell you.  But pop culture, I just...  I didn't know Pixar.  That's like an obscure reference.  Oh, so obscure.  I mean, it's like, if you know a lot about that kind of film, you'd know.  But most people wouldn't know.  Pixar.  Most, most...  I don't know.  Most people do know Pixar.  They're not like a brand name.  I've talked to 300 people.  Like Xerox.  Right.  We talked about Pixar.  None of them knew it.  300.  None of them knew it.  I think you're exaggerating.  I'm not.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  I heard when I was...  I heard when I...  Please tell me this isn't true.  When I was...  When I was saying that Jason...  It's Littler. 
[03:45:30]  Hey, man, you should have went up and told the guard that the guy disrespected you in jail.  You should have told on him.  I heard Poe's going, no, you don't do that in jail.  Can Paul maybe...  I hear there could be a problem if you do that in the jail.  I thought you really wanted that guy to call every day, Opie.  I'm not sure.  Oh, I don't care.  No.  You're carrying a lot of guilt about that.  No, honestly, I don't care.  Not every day.  I think it's going to be causing it.  That dude's calling regardless, man.  Yeah.  Yep.  I swear to God.  Where is Boyz now?  People said on the Instant Feedback, you killed her in that segment.  Where is Boyz? 
[03:46:00]  It was funny.  You made it funny.  The guy was plug, you know, whoring.  How great is this guy?  Oh, yeah.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  You're the best.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  What?  Why is that about dressing selling electronics today?  On 14th Street.  Now, I didn't...  What happened when I said to Jason, you should go up and tell...  You should tell the guards.  I'm like, you ought to go tell the guards that the guy spit on you. 
[03:46:30]  What happened in the office?  What happened in the office when the guy...  I'm sorry.  Say it again.  Remember when Jason called him from prison?  What nationality are you?  Puerto Rican.  When Jason called him from prison and he said the guy spit on me, spit in my mouth.  And I go, you should go right to the guards and report that.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  Yes.  What were you saying?  That's ridiculous.  If you rat in jail, you're a dead man.  We know that.  Okay.  Yes.  But see, we all knew that.  That was like a sarcastic...  That's why it was funny. 
[03:47:00]  Right.  It was funny.  Oh, thank God, Jimmy.  What?  You fucking stink, man.  Come on, man.  You got to man up a little bit.  Where's the Lysol?  Nah, you don't need Lysol.  It's unhealthy stuff.  Come on.  Can we get in your lungs?  Oh, please.  Come on.  Put your hand in the tone for it, Kev.  You have no sense of smell.  You should enjoy this with me.  There's no...  Take a nibble out of it.  There's no thing on it.  I got no sense of smell.  Does that explain it?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Are you awful?  Oh, come on.  Why don't you fucking...  You can't even, like...  You can't smell yourself?  No.  Have a laugh with the boys. 
[03:47:30]  All right.  All right, Po.  That was good.  Thanks, Po.  So why can't you tell a guard?  Wouldn't the guard protect you and look out for you?  That's okay.  Because you were helped doing his job for him?  Well, if you're in protective custody, then, you know, obviously they can't get you.  Well, wouldn't the guard say, like, hey, this guy's all right?  Like, you know, I didn't know that this guy was beating up other guys, so now this  guy, like, I'm going to look out for him a little.  No, no, no.  If he's in general pop and...  GP.  Okay, GP.  If you were in jail and a guy's spitting your mouth, would you hit him? 
[03:48:00]  He wouldn't spit in my mouth.  I wouldn't.  But, I mean, if you were talking, he'd just spit and hit you in the back while you were  talking.  They would do that.  Yeah, I would hit him.  You'd have to hit him, right?  Many times.  Yeah.  Put him out.  You know what you got to do when you go in a joint?  Would you fuck him when he's unconscious?  You find the biggest guy in the yard.  That's right.  And you walk right up to him, make sure everyone's watching.  And pop him.  And he'd pull his pants down and suck his pants.  That's right.  And then you don't ask him to protect you.  You'd say, that was on me.  I don't even want protection.  I just like you. 
[03:48:30]  Poe, have you ever been to jail?  No.  You're Puerto Rican.  It's mandatory.  I worked in jail.  This guy's got hands of steel.  You better watch what you say.  What'd you do in jail?  What'd you do?  I was a contractor in Rikers Island.  You were the cleaner?  No, I was a contractor.  What'd you build?  Like building?  No, asbestos.  Asbestos removal.  Yeah.  I was a supervisor.  While everyone else did the work, I told them what to do.  Billy Mac says you're full of shit.  That's good.  Did they bother you? 
[03:49:00]  You know karate.  He's got a gun.  What's that?  That'd be good.  Did they bother you in jail?  Did they hit on you?  Yeah, they tried.  They said a couple of things.  Hi, Poncho.  Hi, puppy.  Exactly.  And you were like, I'm not done yet.  What?  No, once you know that they're just trying to punk you, they're trying to make you afraid,  and it doesn't work, then you're okay.  Plus, I had a big cop next to me.  Dick.  Six foot four, 285 pounds. 
[03:49:30]  What was his name?  Ron Johnson, stereo salesman?  Who's my bodyguard?  Jason Lee down at the point.  Poe, what kind of fights did you get into in jail?  None.  At what age did you just become a killer?  Seriously.  At what age did you just become, like, you're the guy that you can just roll through life.  No one's going to fuck with Poe.  Period.  Period.  Like, Mike Tyson is going to get busted in the chops if he comes up to Poe.  Period.  At what age did you just, like, turn the page and close that book and go, all right, I'm all done with that? 
[03:50:00]  I shouldn't have mentioned book until Puerto Rican.  Let me give you a different...  Which Chuck Norris movie inspired you?  At what point in your life did you realize, okay, I've reached the level that I need to reach where no one can fucking beat me up unless they fucking are trained.  Poe, I got nothing.  That's all right.  Well, all my life I trained in the martial arts and to me it was, you know, it was part of my life until I was attacked and a few people wanted to kill me. 
[03:50:30]  And that's when it turned around.  What was that?  In the room right behind us?  Yeah.  Well, you were attacked, what?  Yes, I was.  Why did they want to kill you if they attacked you?  His name was Steven Seagal.  Well, it's a long story, but they...  Kevin, pay attention.  This is good.  I'm listening.  They didn't like me because I was Puerto Rican, and they said, Spick, I'm going to take this knife and I'm going to place it in certain parts of your body. 
[03:51:00]  Where was this?  What parts?  What parts of the body?  Elmo.  If I remember Long Island, Holtzville is on the south side.  It's to the north of that.  It's right by 112.  Are these white guys with knives?  You were in Coram or Port Jeff?  Yeah, I think it was Coram.  Good wrestling in Port Jeff.  Right by 112.  Coram, you got to watch out.  Good high school wrestling in Port Jeff.  Yeah.  It was me and one guy and his wife.  What happened?  And his wife.  Great wrestling in Port Jeff.  Well, we were at the 7-Eleven, and it was cold out.  It was in the middle of winter, and my car broke down. 
[03:51:30]  Of course.  And we have the greatest of cars at violence.  The Celica with the Jesus Christ stencils headlights and the spoiler on the back.  It's snowing into the trunk because it's open with the speaker showing.  Did you have a soccer flag on your hood?  Poe, before I met you and I listened to the show on XM in my home in the hills of Los Angeles,  you sound on the radio like a fat China man.  Like when you say it.  He aspires to be. 
[03:52:00]  Odd job.  So what happened?  You're at 7-Eleven.  Yeah.  Where was he going to stick the knife?  Well, he was going to take the knife and stick it in my ass.  And he was going to drive it straight up in front of my body and go around my throat and do other things.  How did all this happen?  I don't think I just said it here?  That's impossible.  Well, what happened is there was two guys, and they got into an argument with my friend.  About what?  My battery died, and we wanted to jump my car, and my friend placed negative to positive, positive. 
[03:52:30]  Big A, Poe.  And that just caused a big problem.  Why?  You messed up their car, too?  You fucked up the other guy's car.  Exactly.  And they started arguing.  Oh, they were actually going to help you guys jump a car?  They were going to help us jump my car, my car that was in bad shape.  And they kept on arguing and screaming, and I looked to my right, and it was about 12.  I don't hear anything.  I hear about 12 guys.  There was about 12 guys drinking, and in seconds, they were surrounding us. 
[03:53:00]  This post car trying to start.  Well, now I have a Camry XLS.  Oh.  Air condition, heat, windshield wiper.  Everything from the 20th century.  So what happened?  I like when they sell cars, and they really don't have anything to tell you about it,  so on the windshield, it says, clean.  It's like when you say it in a motel, and it says, beds. 
[03:53:30]  I like the ones that still advertise.  Free HBO.  Free HBO.  Oh, wow.  Well, we got us down here.  That's a reason to get fucking fleas.  Poe, you get headline, because you got like three stories, but they take an hour.  Well, no, what?  Now, tell me, what happened?  The guys surrounding you?  Yeah, this story can go quick.  You were arguing.  Yeah, really.  It was very simple.  Big A, Poe.  They attacked us, and I had a stick in my hand.  They had weapons, and they didn't touch me.  What type of weapons?  They had a knife.  They had a brass knuckles.  And you had a stick.  I had one stick.  One stick, and you fought off three guys.  No. 
[03:54:00]  How many?  Twelve at first.  Twelve guys with knives.  One knife.  One knife.  Broken bottle.  What is your problem?  You insensitive asshole.  I tell people this, and they laugh, because they don't think that it's true.  That's okay.  It doesn't matter.  Do you think you could beat me and Kevin Smith in a fight?  No, you guys are too tough for me.  That's right, bitches.  The reason I...  You recognize that shit.  Here's the reason I believe him.  Yeah.  Because nobody would make up 12.  You'd make up three.  Yeah, they would if they were 12. 
[03:54:30]  You got to make up 12.  No, you wouldn't make up 12.  I mean, you can make up 12.  It didn't even have to be 12 for me.  I would cave at the two dudes.  Yeah.  Two dudes threatening me.  I'd be like, I'll suck both your cocks at once.  Just don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me.  Oh, let's yell at them.  I have no interest in fighting.  I hear stories like that, and my mind just shuts down.  Is he liking the porno when the girl's sucking two dicks at once and she rubs the heads together?  Yeah, and then she leaves and they just stand there and go, let's be silly geese.  I'm not sure how I feel about that. 
[03:55:00]  Like, if you're getting blown...  Who's lucky, are you the guy or her?  But then, like, she takes both your dicks and goes, oh, I'll rub them together.  It's cute.  Like, they're little puppets kissing.  And you're like, I know I'm getting my dick sucked, but what's with the extra?  It's like jumping the car batteries when we went positive to positive.  Positive to negative is bad because then they both become positive.  Wow.  LOL.  Thanks, Kev.  People want to know if the attackers came one at a time.  Yeah, like in the movies.  Like in the kung fu movies. 
[03:55:30]  Like in the movies.  That's another question everyone keeps on asking me.  Well, if your mic worked, we would know if it were.  Why did they try to get in?  Well, not mic work.  They tried to get in.  The mic still doesn't work.  Why would it work?  If you talked any slower, you'd be fucking Senator Lieberman.  They tried to get in.  I think the battery went dead during Poe's story, and it was a new battery.  They tried to get in, and they couldn't.  They tried to get in.  There was 12, and then two more came after that.  14.  It was 14.  And they cornered us next to the 7-Eleven door. 
[03:56:00]  And my friend tried to open the 7-Eleven door, and they locked it.  How did 14 guys get in one car that was trying to jump your car?  No, no, no.  12 guys were drinking.  You can't lock a 7-Eleven door, though.  I didn't bring up.  They were locking the 7-Eleven door.  I couldn't get in.  Did I lock it?  He locked the door because he was afraid of what can happen.  I mean, these guys had weapons, and I was swinging my stick, so I guess he got scared.  I didn't bring up the fact that they were all 7 years old, gentlemen.  So when he locked the door, I started banging on the door.  Figured that would be an easy fight.  They tried to kill me. 
[03:56:30]  So you locked the door.  I then went to the Twinkie defense.  I grabbed some Twinkies and started wielding them at the offensive 14.  Kevin Smith is doing fucking scratch-ups.  Kevin is just telling this horrific story of when he was attacking.  It's horrific because he takes too long to fucking tell it.  Kevin Smith does a quarter, and he's striking a lot.  Let me show you how you tell a story.  Ready?  Go ahead.  Me and my friend, the car broke down, and this guy went to help us jump the car, and 
[03:57:00]  then I fucked up his car when I jumped in.  He's like, you fucking spick.  He's got a knife.  They jump us.  And then these other guys are standing by drinking, and they come around.  A fucking humor on this thing.  The same thing happened to Paul, though.  All right, Paul.  I'm asking you to help me out here, Henry.  I do a lot of fucking favors for you, don't I?  Twelve Long Islanders prejudiced against Puerto Ricans in this day and age.  I'm just trying to buy a jukeboard.  What's wrong with you, Henry?  What kind of people are these?  So what finally...  They knocked me out.  I'm saying, I thought I told you to go fuck your mother. 
[03:57:30]  Ping, ping, ping.  I wish I was big just once.  Just once.  I wish I understood sarcasm.  That's the fucking...  What finally happened?  That's the sentence of that entire character, Kevin.  I wish I was big just once.  They cornered me...  What happened?  Oh, no.  When they cornered me against the Southern Illinois door, they couldn't get in.  They couldn't get towards me.  Right.  The sticks were going...  My stick was going too fast, and they couldn't touch me.  So they just left?  No.  I was banging the door because they locked the door, as I said.  They wouldn't let us in.  And I was jumping in the air, elbowing, headbutting, doing everything possible to get into the door. 
[03:58:00]  You had just un-fuck yourself, or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck!  That's right.  Finally, they realized that I was going to break the door.  He saw the phone on me!  But the 12 guys didn't break the door down?  No, they were in front of me.  They surrounded me.  But I mean, they didn't come once the door was open.  They just turned out...  Oh, right!  No, no, no.  As soon as I went in...  Oh, my God.  That was...  Oh, shit.  Hurry up.  Kevin Smith is looking for Sudoku right now.  Sudoku! 
[03:58:30]  Sudoku, huh?  What?  Sudoku?  Sudoku.  Whatever.  Oh, is that how it's pronounced?  Sudoku.  What is that?  No, it's not.  Committing suicide.  No, we're...  Oh, he's right.  He's right.  We're talking about it.  Those tits are out every five seconds!  Just get a fucking train, and have guys jack off all over you.  You make money on the web.  She's the greatest.  All right.  You're the greatest.  Is the story over?  I get scared.  Why don't you do it to the mic?  What?  Jimmy.  Why don't you do it to the mic for the best of?  Because they were talking about something.  I don't want to be crass. 
[03:59:00]  Who's they?  Fucking Poe and the six voices in his head?  I was swinging my stick and headbutting.  All right.  Finish this story, Poe.  Oh, they couldn't get at me.  What is your major malfunction, nub-nuts?  I'm laughing about it today, but then it wasn't part of me.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Who did that?  Wait, the guys?  You went inside the 7-Eleven, and they locked the door, and they didn't come after you?  No.  As soon as they opened the 7-Eleven door, I stayed in front of the door. 
[03:59:30]  And they tried to get in, and they couldn't.  I stayed by the 7-Eleven door, and I made sure that they couldn't get through the opening.  Shut up, you damn asshole!  I wish they did.  You damn asshole!  Shut your fucking mouth, you damn asshole!  That's my weapon.  Shut up, you damn asshole!  I one time fought off 14 people with a gasser like that.  I let them into the 7-Eleven, and I dropped it, and they fought to get out.  Gasser?  Who are you, Sinatra?  With a gasser.  It was a real gasser.  A gasser, baby.  Because you are a disgusting fat body, private file! 
[04:00:00]  Jay is just having fun pushing buttons today.  I want that in my car.  Why don't we just go home?  Yeah, why don't we just go home?  Because the American Idol winner is calling in a couple of minutes, that's why.  We waited long enough for Taylor Hicks.  No, we didn't!  Oh, he's late?  No, he's not.  He's got three minutes.  No, he was supposed to call at 11.  That's what Ben says.  What does Ben know?  He's highlighting.  He doesn't know.  Well, 11 minutes, dude.  He has no idea.  What time does Clerks 2 come out?  What time?  What day?  July 21st.  July 21st, sir.  How long was your shooting schedule? 
[04:00:30]  We shot for like 26 days.  And you shot at where?  Mostly in Buena Park, up on Knott's Berry Farm.  And then we did a week in Jersey.  I just want to point out I won nothing in the post-scratch-off game.  You got nothing in the post-scratch-off game.  That stinks.  I'm all off.  I was thinking, wouldn't it be great if I was just on the show and I had time to kill  and I fucking won?  Jay Moore's in the floor house and he scratched off 100 checks.  Eric won $100,000, sir.  Eric won $100,000.  He was one of those guys that when they had the misprint and a bunch of people won $100,000,  they said, send it in and we'll put it in like a hat and pull it out. 
[04:01:00]  We'll do a lottery protocol on this kind of thing.  And he won.  I didn't buy the newspaper, but I won the $100,000.  Exactly.  That was the whole show.  That's the whole fucking thing.  Because they said it was the studio's paper that he scratched and he said, no, it was  mine.  And he sent in.  You better believe you say it was yours, sir.  And he gave nothing.  You say it was yours.  He gave nothing to anybody.  He basically told a fib, but no one could prove it any different.  Good for him.  I'm with him.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck that.  Because none of them would have wasted time to scratch it off.  Exactly.  He did and he won.  That's why I'm all for Hawking his filthy lies.  Is this Taylor Hicks? 
[04:01:30]  Is that Taylor Hicks?  Moore, what are you doing next?  What happened, Ben?  Besides your lovely girlfriend.  Nothing.  Nothing?  I'm telling you.  Why don't we just go to the phone?  If it's not, we'll hang up on them.  No scripts through the transom?  Nothing?  He did Brown and Bubbly.  You can't hire yourself.  What's Brown?  He did Brown and Bubbly.  I had Pepsi commercials, but that went to the...  That's right.  I just...  I saw him.  You made a mistake of him.  I saw that one.  What was your diarrhea line?  That kind of blew up your car pay?  I'm not going to say it again.  All right.  All right.  We just heard things that he might have...  Where's...  And when's Groomson coming out? 
[04:02:00]  Where's Taylor Hicks?  A couple minutes to Taylor Hicks.  Taylor Hicks.  We're not breaking.  We're just sitting here.  No, wait.  We're going to break.  You're going to promote it?  Wait.  Break for him.  I thought my pilot was going to get picked up.  What pilot, Jay?  How'd you get that?  What?  What was the pilot for?  What was it?  NBC and Sony Community Service.  It was really funny and just...  What was it called?  Community Service.  What was it about?  Fish Out of Water.  Classic Fish Out of Water story.  Oh, cool, cool, cool.  I'm a big shot, really. 
[04:02:30]  Fucking did he get picked up?  Fuck you.  Last Comic Standing.  You with your job.  Oh, right.  Last Comic Standing.  What the fuck?  Last Comic Standing.  How the hell did they bring the show back after canceling it before the last episode?  I'm no longer affiliated with Last Comic Standing, but I wish them a lot of luck.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  Oh, you're still production or some producer?  No.  I took my name off it.  But the idea is like you have some kind of intellectual property.  Right.  It came out of your balls.  That forensic spot is my ball bag.  What?  How did they bring a show back that they canceled before the finale? 
[04:03:00]  Because it's the network.  They could fuck up toast, Anthony.  Are you serious?  You see the Jake effect on Bravo?  It's like a fucking brilliant show.  Did you see it?  Uh-uh.  It's Jason Bateman and Nicky Cox and Kyle Gass, all teachers.  Bateman's a lawyer that quits to teach inner city kids and is shot on film.  And that was the year, like, Jeff Zucker said, I don't like single camera.  Eh.  Eh.  And now it's on Bravo and you're like, this show's, like, great.  What, is it Bravo, like, brilliant but canceled or something?  How many episodes did they do?  Eight.  They filmed them all and they just never put them on TV. 
[04:03:30]  Another show that was on brilliant but canceled.  A little show called Action.  Action.  Action was awesome.  Yeah.  Action, my friend.  Action was a great, great show.  How many episodes did you shoot?  I'm always about five years ahead of my time, boys.  Mm-hmm.  How many episodes last did you shoot?  Thirteen, eight aired.  But one's missing.  The one with Ice Cube is not on the DVD box set.  I wonder why.  Bastard Black.  We shot Thirteen as well.  He goes like this.  I go, where's my daughter?  And he goes, she's in your office with Ice Cube.  And I go, you left my daughter alone with a gangster rapper. 
[04:04:00]  And me and Buddy Hackett run in and Hackett's got his gun drawn.  And they're on the ground playing cards.  And she goes, go fish.  And Ice Cube looks up and, like, into the barrel of Hackett's gun.  And he goes, what's with all the heat?  And I go, oh, I'm sorry, Ice Cube.  Lately we've been having problems with, um, um, uh.  And Hackett goes, blacks.  I go, bats.  Black bats.  Really?  Blacks is funny.  Fucking tell the sound meter in the room. 
[04:04:30]  Well, no, because then I'm going to add it to it.  Black bats kind of killed him.  I thought blacks were very funny.  Fucking faggot.  Can't help it.  Let's go to Craig in Massachusetts.  What the hell just happened, Lou?  Let's go to Taylor Hicks.  Craig, what's up?  Poe is full of shit.  Not true.  What the hell just happened, Lou?  Listen, I've been fighting for 14 years.  MMA, 14 years.  No.  No way you took on 12 people, my friend.  I'm 14.  Unless you're at an elementary school and it was lunchtime.  Are you serious?  It didn't happen.  Why don't you come here and put your dick in his face? 
[04:05:00]  That's right.  It didn't happen.  Hey.  Fuck you, faggot.  Whoa, Poe, take it easy, Poe.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, this is Poe.  That happened to me, actually.  It didn't.  What?  I did do that.  That happened.  It did not.  So you swung a stick.  So you took stick fighting, I'm assuming?  There's no way.  I swung the stick.  There's no way.  Let Poe talk.  Let Poe talk.  I swung the stick.  I kept them away.  I was banging on the doors.  And none of them got within two feet of me. 
[04:05:30]  You're insane.  It's insane.  It didn't happen.  I could see it.  Maybe they didn't want to touch you.  You're swinging the stick.  I was swinging the stick.  They had the knife in the broken bottle.  And none of them got within two feet of me.  I was knocking on the door.  Listen to me.  Can I ask you a question?  You sure can.  Did they try to stab you?  Did they try to stab you?  Or were they just like having second thoughts and you're scaring them away with your stick?  The only one man had the knife and he took a swing in my direction. 
[04:06:00]  And I hit him with the stick.  And the knife fell.  Okay, so one guy's doing it and then he's with a bunch of his friends?  Yes, and they were being menacing.  And there was another gentleman that I believe had a knife and he showed it.  But he didn't try to attack with it when he saw the way I defended against the first one.  A little bit more believable now.  But you made it sound like they were attacking you.  But no, I was only telling the story.  And I know it's not.  You know as long as I do that that's impossible.  I don't care if it's 14 girls.  You're not going to fight them off.  They have knives and bottles.  It's not going to happen.  They're going to get hurt. 
[04:06:30]  But the important thing is that I was doing battle and they finally opened the door and  let me in.  In the 7-Eleven.  You are a true warrior.  They wouldn't open the door.  All right, man.  I'm out.  All right, Craig.  You're a faggot.  Yeah, beat it, stupid.  How long are we going to wait for Tellerhead?  I say until he comes.  I say no.  What do we got on Tellerhead?  How are you on a set?  A lot of guys shows up late.  He's calling when, Ben?  It happens.  When?  When?  Now?  It happens.  Ben's yelling now.  I did two black movies in a row. 
[04:07:00]  You know something?  Tell that gray-haired fuck to go fuck himself.  I don't mean Tellerhead.  I mean Billy Mac.  He really does.  They're always late.  And they got to get their wigs on?  Oh, black people?  What?  You said black people.  You said black people.  Are always late?  Yeah.  I did two black movies in a row and I was always like, like my call, they go, all right,  we're picking you up at 6.15.  I'm like, all right, I'll be down at 7.  And I get there at 8 and I'd be there like fucking an hour, like, hello, hello, hello,  hello. 
[04:07:30]  I'd go in my trailer and I'd sleep.  And they roll in like at fucking 11 and they start putting their wigs on.  Black women wear wigs.  Yeah.  And you know what?  They walk around like it's a fucking, like it's just, yeah, I got wigs on.  What's the big deal?  Like it's no big deal.  I'm going to fuck.  I'll punch you in the fucking face.  What are you doing?  What are you coming in to grab Jay by the shoulders?  You don't know me very well.  What?  Go over there.  What?  Give him a mic.  What are you doing? 
[04:08:00]  Bobby, what are you doing?  First of all, you know what?  I didn't care about the gay stuff.  You interrupted what was going to be a great fucking black people wearing wigs story.  He's telling a story.  You come out of nowhere and go to touch.  Oh, but buy your girlfriend a wig and have her just walk down Fifth Avenue with it and watch  everyone look at her like, what's with the fucking white lady in her wig?  And then everyone, you know, every fucking Florida Evans in town is walking around with  the hand that they brought for James' funeral.  Damn, damn, damn.  Can't get a job.  Let's, uh, hey, Taylor.  Hey.  Hey, whoo.  Woo.  Soul Patrol. 
[04:08:30]  Soul Patrol.  I'm sure you're sick of saying that by now.  Listen, I just want to set the table here.  We got Jay Moore in studio.  We got Kevin Smith.  You ever see Clerks?  Yeah.  Clerks 2 coming out July 21st.  He's in the studio.  Awesome.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  You might know him from, uh...  Jerry Maguire.  Jerry Maguire.  And Last Comic Standing.  Last Comic Standing.  Awesome stuff, man.  I voted for you, Taylor.  Hey, I appreciate it.  A lot of people voted for Taylor, obviously, because, uh...  Once the color girl was out, I voted for Taylor every time.  I know, yeah. 
[04:09:00]  Jimmy.  Well, the, uh...  Mandisa?  Yeah.  Paris.  Oh, you like Paris?  She was all right, but I've always liked them a little.  I want to get right to the controversy.  Taylor, I read a little article about you that says, uh, some of the execs aren't happy  with you, being, uh, the American Idol, because your personality isn't quite how you portray  it on the air.  You're a little caustic.  Oh, really?  That's what I read, but I...  Well, you know, what you see is what you get with me, you know, and that's just the way  that I've, that's the way I've always been, and, you know, like I said, man, I'm having 
[04:09:30]  the time of my life, and, and what you see is what you get.  See?  I never doubted him for a second.  Did, uh, did you have a moment where you started realizing, oh, my God, I'm getting  famous, like, I mean, you guys all start out at the auditions, and then obviously the  show starts, when did it hit you, like, holy crap, there's a lot of people watching this  show, and everyone knows who I am?  I guess, you know, when I went home in, um, Birmingham, Alabama, I, you know, there were  12,000 people there, and there were people that were feigning, uh, having to be escorted 
[04:10:00]  out on gurneys and stretchers, and, I mean, that, that just is overwhelming to me, and it  was, uh, it was an amazing, you know, that, that whole trip home, I guess, back home,  um, really kind of, um, it set in with me that, that how big this thing is.  Right, right.  Hey, did they, did they try to get you to, uh, color your hair?  The, the, the show, you know, they, they wanted to, they wanted to see me dye it or something  like that, but you know what, man, what you see is what you get, and here I am, you know?  I've heard that, sure.  Yeah, well, Catherine McPhee didn't get a nice homecoming like you did. 
[04:10:30]  She got a nice big ass on her, though.  Yeah, well, no, she lost weight as the show went on.  Yeah.  Too bad.  We all said, you know, she needed to get, uh, get some cardio in.  Hey, Taylor.  Yo.  Weren't you all expecting Chris Daughtry to win the whole thing, and, like, it was pretty  much who was going to come in second?  Yeah, it was a pretty, I mean, yeah, we all just kind of had that vibe, and, I mean, you  know, he's, he's got a great voice, he's a, he's a great vocal talent.  Yeah, he's got the whole, like, look, rocker thing down.  He's like him because he looks like your brother. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  No, he looks like my brother, my brother went on this Fat Smash diet.  Elliot, I always thought that, uh, the Yasmin, the guy with, the Frodo-looking guy, with  the crooked teeth.  Yeah.  Elliot?  Elliot.  I thought he was going to win.  Really?  I had you picked from the beginning.  He didn't have as much, enough personality.  No, I voted for the color girl, and when the color girl was out, I voted for the, for  the Taylor man.  Taylor had the personality, which carries, uh, you a long way.  Well, yeah.  Elliot, everybody in there, everybody in the competition was, was talented, you know, and, and Elliot 
[04:11:30]  was a, was a great vocalist.  Yeah, but he didn't have the personality.  You want to know why he lost?  Motherfucker has to have some personality, like that pig Arnold.  I'll tell you why that motherfucker lost, it's because when he went home, he never took  the sunglasses off.  Is that it?  And he looked like he was trying to be a big shot.  He's like, he's indoors with his sunglasses on.  Like, Taylor's at the governor's mansion, and appropriately odd, you know.  Hey, do they own you now?  Sorry.  Who does?  Sorry, I'm stepping all over you.  You know why?  This has to move, Jay.  So, do they own everything you do now, American Idol? 
[04:12:00]  Uh, no.  I, you know, as soon as I get done with the, um, as soon as I get done with the tour, as  soon as I get done with, uh, with the show, it's pretty much, I'm on my own as a solo artist.  What if you don't live that long?  Jesus.  What if you don't live that long?  Then they did own you.  Well, you know, um.  Don't answer that.  Don't answer that.  Are you doing anything but sleeping with women?  That's all I would do if I was in your position.  You know, that's a nice thought, but I'm, uh, but, uh, you know, I've been doing so many 
[04:12:30]  press outlets in the last seven days, I've, I've, it's been hard to think about.  See, our friend, we have, we have a, a, a girl that works here, uh, Ms. Travis, and  she said that, like, they own you forever when, when, once, once your contract is, they  own, like, a piece of everything you ever do.  Um, you know, there are some contractual obligations, but everything is negotiable.  You got a, you got a band, right?  Uh, I have a band.  Oh, you used to have a band.  The Little Memphis Blues Orchestra, they're great. 
[04:13:00]  Now, how do they feel?  They're, they're, you know what, they're reaping a little of the benefits, too.  You know, they, they, uh, they were on the show performing.  We were on, when I went home, they, they performed with me, and, and, uh, you know, they're making  their way as well.  Do you still call it the same band, or is it now called Taylor and the Replaceables?  Yeah, you would think that, huh?  It could be, you know?  Uh, you know, they, they're really doing good, man.  They're enjoying, they're enjoying it.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know what you got to do now.  What, they tour you for, like, forever?  All summer, right? 
[04:13:30]  All summer long?  Yeah, they tour me all summer.  The, the tour starts July 5th, and, um.  And you tour with, like, the top 12, but you're kind of, you know, the star?  Is that it?  It's the top 10.  Top 10?  Yeah.  And then you come out, and you're like, you know, you tell the rest of them, hey,  back up, I'm the star.  So, so, uh, Chicken Little's not going to be on tour with you guys, with that bad lisp  of his?  Nah, Chicken Little.  Nah, I don't think so.  Chicken Little didn't make the cut.  Didn't make the cut.  And is Kelly Pickler as dumb as, uh, she portrays herself on TV?  Don't do the politically correct answer, Kelly. 
[04:14:00]  You need satellite radio.  You can curse on everything.  Yeah, it's a satellite.  You can even talk like they do down in Bama.  Don't tell me that.  Why?  Hey, I knew it, right?  Rape straight in Carl's face.  Yeah, I knew it.  Here he comes, baby.  I've only wanted to cuss on radio.  Do it.  Do it now.  You feel like cussing, Taylor?  I can't.  I can't do it.  I'm not going to do it.  Because they own your ass.  That's right.  You guys.  Is that what it is?  Too many families, uh, looking up to you.  American Idol, you're like a, uh, an idol now to America, hence the name of the contest. 
[04:14:30]  And if you start cursing, little kids are going to be cursing, so you've got to watch  your mouth, right?  Very true.  Come on.  Come on, motherfucker.  One more.  Come on.  Just one.  Just shit on somebody.  How about you just whisper one?  No.  Just whisper.  What about Kelly Pickler?  Was she a real, uh, a shit-stabber or what?  Um, I'm pleading the fifth on that one.  You're pleading the fifth?  Did she have a steady diet of black dick all night?  Oh, Jesus.  That would be a negative. 
[04:15:00]  I hear Simon's a real fuck, right?  That'd be a positive.  Yeah, okay.  That would be a positive.  So, uh, where does the tour start?  Um, it starts in New Hampshire.  Well, I guess it doesn't even matter.  We don't even have to talk about the tour because it's selling out, like, all over the  place.  Oh, it's playing at the I Love You Johnny Cakes, uh, cafe first.  And sell it.  They're going to probably sell a lot of tickets.  I mean, a couple more than that.  Maybe you didn't give a number.  What?  I'm saying they're going to be selling out everywhere they go, man.  That's a great gig.  We're adding a couple more.  They're adding dates all over.  Are you guys doing any New York or New Jersey venues? 
[04:15:30]  Yeah, of course.  You go to American Idol dot com and they'll find all the tour dates.  Yeah.  Can I come to the show?  All good.  Everything's going to be great, man.  Girls.  You know, like I said, I went from, um, performing in bars and little places to being on a stage  like this.  Listen, it's a, it's a dream come true for me.  A lot like you.  What kind of album are you going to do?  Like a soul album, obviously?  Yeah, soul, man.  Soul album.  My own album.  My stamp of approval, you know? 
[04:16:00]  It's me that's gotten me here and, and I'm not changing.  Hey, I got a note.  I'll read it, uh, word for word.  Publicist called.  He has to move on now.  Damn it.  I guess they're not happy with how we're interviewing them.  It's satellite radio, though, so that's why.  She's sounding a real twat.  Publicists always do that.  Publicists are usually cunts.  Don't you agree with that, Taylor?  This is, uh, I get, they're worried about your image, I'm sure.  Well, no, I don't, I don't think it's, I, I, like I said, I've, I've got about 15 more 
[04:16:30]  interviews to do, so I think they're kind of just trying to move me on.  Fuck them.  What interview's next?  Fuck them in their fucking asses.  They are nothing but fucking clown shoes.  Well, you're a cunt, lady.  You fucking bitch cunt.  Fuck you.  Jimmy.  So, we, we.  That was James.  Hello?  We're never getting another guest again.  Ever, ever, ever.  Oh, my God.  You called the publicist a cuntor.  Yeah, but she didn't.  How big did she be? 
[04:17:00]  You called the publicist a cuntor.  And we were just starting to get real guests.  Oh, wow.  You've had great guests lately.  Wow, are we never, ever getting another guest?  You watch how the guests drastically drop after today.  Kevin's not coming back.  He's doing scratch-off tickets.  He's bored with the show already.  He's done three Sudokus.  I will always come back.  But it was kind of funny.  That was funny.  Yeah, that was funny.  I've got to hear that again.  Did she hang up?  Yeah.  Oh, they hung up immediately.  That is an image they can have for these people. 
[04:17:30]  Be real, man.  That's the whole thing.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  Can you rewind?  I've got to hear that again.  Yeah, I want to hear her hang up.  Just like the last, like, 45 seconds of the interview.  The guy is from Alabama.  He's been working gin mills his whole life.  The guy never uses the F-bomb or anything like that.  Be who you are.  He goes, what you see is what you get.  Well, you're on satellite radio.  Call someone an asshole.  You're allowed.  There's a publicist hovering over him like a vulture.  Like, a cunt whore.  Don't answer that.  I think Jimmy called her that. 
[04:18:00]  Jay called her a cunt whore.  Well, let's listen back to the tape and see if it was Jay running here.  Yeah, listen.  I'll bet everything I own that it's got me.  All right.  I'll put up $40, too.  You don't have it yet?  $46.  What happened?  It's on the computer.  It takes 10 years to get the right.  Who told you we had to go?  Oh, gee.  What?  Publicist told them.  They passed it to me.  I passed it to you.  All right.  Where's Ben?  And then Jay called her a cunt whore.  Ben is really pissed. 
[04:18:30]  He tries so hard to keep good relationships with the publicist.  Look, I've known you guys a long time.  I don't care, Jay.  You've had one fucking guest in three years because of Ben.  Now that Ben...  What?  Big publicist, though.  That was a big publicist.  We'll just blame it all on Jay.  It's on Jay.  It was who?  Wait, Roland books a guest on your show.  How bad was that for us?  I don't want to slow my career down.  It was pretty bad, though.  It was pretty bad, though.  It was just like I had to email and say, yeah, the black dick coming came from Jay.  Yeah, blame everything on Jay Moore.  Fuck you.  Wait, so that was a big publicist? 
[04:19:00]  Yeah, from Fox.  Who does she represent?  Blame it on Kevin Smith.  He's beyond the post.  All of Fox.  Who do we get from Fox?  Come after me.  All of Fox.  When you think about it, who do we get from Fox?  Me and my big mouth.  So, uh...  Love that.  Yeah, I just shared an email.  I'll just say it with Jay Moore.  God bless you.  Are you going to be able to smooth that over?  Yeah, I'll smooth it over.  I represent...  Why are you going to say me?  O and A weren't even in the studio.  I represent...  I represent...  I represent...  Yeah, I'll say it was like, um...  No homo Bobby.  You said...  All right.  That was Bobby.  It was Bobby.  I represent... 
[04:19:30]  I'll just let him off an email.  Kevin say something.  Kevin does want to say anything.  I'm taking it in, man.  The show derailed a while ago, and I'm just watching.  I love it.  How does derail?  Isn't it true?  Everyone always says, like, the show derails, and I'm like...  When Jay's on the show, fucking gets off the tracks.  I listen every day.  Is there some fucking formula you guys are on that I'm not a part of?  Let's listen to the publicist.  Let's see who...  Let's hear.  Let's see where...  Let's see where we're wrong.  The cunt war formula.  What?  Yeah.  I have to call her.  She's upset.  Oh, what does her email say? 
[04:20:00]  I'm not thrilled with the idle interview.  I'm upset.  What?  She said she's not thrilled with the interview, so please call me.  Oh, please call immediately.  Don't mention my name, dude.  I won't.  Oh, my God.  I'm fucking telling you.  Oh, look at Jay.  He's going to kick some ass.  Don't mention my fucking name.  You better have 14 friends with you, gentlemen.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  I'll know in about a half hour if you mention my name.  Jay Moore.  Oh, man.  All right.  Let's listen back to the tape.  Let's see where it went wrong.  Let's see where it went wrong at hello. 
[04:20:30]  Go ahead.  Word for word.  Publicist called.  He has to move on now.  Damn it.  I guess they're not happy with how we're interviewing them.  It's satellite radio, though.  She's sounding like a real twat.  Publicists always do that.  Publicists are usually cunts.  Don't you agree with that, Taylor?  Anthony, well, they're a cunt.  They're worried about your image, I'm sure.  Well, no, I don't, I don't think it's, I, like I said, I've got about 15 more interviews  to do, so I think they're kind of just trying to move.  Fuck them. 
[04:21:00]  What interview's next?  Fuck them in their fucking asses.  Anthony, again.  Anthony, you have to go.  Well, you're a cunt, lady, you fucking bitch cunt.  Fuck you.  Jimmy.  So, we, we.  That was Jay Moore.  Hello?  We're never getting another guest.  Okay, I do understand.  We're back live.  I may have thrown in a couple.  I will have to blame Anthony.  Why?  Because she was.  You excited a riot.  Yeah, she was already pretty much gone.  I didn't hear her.  When Jay jumped on the pile.  No, I didn't.  You did it.  I didn't hear her on the pile. 
[04:21:30]  And then Jay jumped on the pile.  And my line was from one of Kevin's movies.  My line was from Kevin's movie.  Don't drag me into this.  That's why I said it.  All right, we blame Kevin Smith first, then Anthony.  I don't even watch American Idol.  Jay Moore jumped.  Oh, my God.  Not even supporting the show, Kevin Smith.  I've never seen it.  Oh, we're so sunk.  Here's the deal.  Listen again.  They already committed to hang up on us.  Mostly because of what you said.  You see how much they hate it.  And then Jay Moore jumped on the pile.  All right, let's go.  Jay directly called me. 
[04:22:00]  In hockey, I'm the third guy in.  I'm the ejection.  You're the major.  That's right.  Yes, exactly.  No!  Yes.  Yes.  Listen again.  You got the gloves, and I came in to help you.  Listen again, and just be quiet.  It's satellite radio, though, so that's why.  She's sounding like a real twat.  Publicists always do that.  Publicists are usually cunts.  Don't you agree with that, Taylor?  They're worried about your image, I'm sure.  Well, no.  I don't think it's...  Like I said, I've got about 15 more interviews to do, so I think they're kind of just trying  to move me along. 
[04:22:30]  Fuck them!  What interview's next?  Fuck them in their fucking asses.  They are nothing but fucking clown shoes.  We have to go.  Well, you're a cunt, lady, you fucking bitch cunt.  Fuck you.  Jimmy.  That was Jane...  Hello?  No.  We're never getting another guy.  I have a defense.  I have a total defense.  I said most...  I said they're usually cunts.  Usually.  Which didn't call her directly a cunt.  And then I was talking about the other stations.  Fuck them in their fucking asses, their fucking clown shoes.  The other interviews.  Right.  And then Jay got on and directly called her a cunt whore. 
[04:23:00]  The last thing she heard before she hung up was Jimmy.  No.  Jay Moore.  No.  She heard Jimmy.  What did Jimmy say?  I said Jimmy.  He made it sound like Jimmy said all the time.  Listen to the last part.  I know.  You made it sound like Jimmy.  And then you said Jimmy.  So who do we blame?  Jay Moore.  You got her riled up.  No, no.  I don't have a job.  I might not either now.  I got two boats to sail in here.  It's fine.  Yeah, we got two boats.  We'd blow one of these gigs up.  We could lose one still. 
[04:23:30]  Go right over to the other one again.  The message boards say you guys going to CBS is an admission of the fact that you're  failing on this.  Yes, right.  Exactly.  We're failing.  What do we blame?  It's got to be you.  The publicist.  No, Jay Moore.  And I like Jay, believe me.  But I'm not going to take the blame.  I said publicists are usually cunts.  Because they are.  We've dealt with them.  The fact of the matter is she was hanging up regardless of what anybody said.  Right, right.  They don't have to fuck themselves in their fucking...  She didn't like the line of questioning.  The other 15 interviews.  She didn't like the line of questioning. 
[04:24:00]  They had more shit to do.  Right.  The 15...  I'd be more outraged at his bullshit answer of like, well, I got 15 more of these things  to do.  Yeah.  I hate that corn pone kind of fucking fake niceness.  Yeah, that's what I was goofing on too.  Where were you?  Yeah, where were you when we needed you?  I like to say shit after it's all done.  I editorialize.  I'm the man after the fact.  We needed that.  I'm not going to jump in when the water's all bloody and shit.  I'm going to look at the entrails that are left behind and then comment on them.  They're calling me out.  I didn't do anything.  We were doing well with guests, but that'll go away.  That's done now.  Hey, can we...  Why did that guy come over here with a camera crew? 
[04:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  By the way, why in the middle of that story did that intern decide he was going to start  tackling Jay?  With the camcorder from 1988?  Can we...  It was like he was completely dressed and he just got close.  I don't know.  Why don't we bring Bobby in?  We'll end with Bobby.  If he come any closer, he's going to be...  Did he get that?  I'll stop here, then.  All right.  Yeah, what do we got?  We're wrapping up here.  Kevin Smith, Clerks 2, July 21st.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I hope you had fun enough to come back.  I did.  I did not come in to pimp.  I came in because I was staying in the city for three days.  Just to hang out. 
[04:25:00]  Cool.  Just to hang out.  Bobby?  Watch the show derail.  Why'd you guys come in with a camera crew?  That's great.  That was it.  Didn't you film Clerks on that, the original?  That's our camera.  Bobby?  I felt bad it would have happened with Jay, and I just want to bury the hatchet.  I know, you know...  So what were you going to do?  I don't know.  In the middle...  Just pat in the back and tell him, you know, I'm sorry.  A little whisper.  Did you notice he was telling a story, and we're on the air?  I should have been probably paying attention to that.  You just walked in with a camera and a thing to do your bit.  Well, I didn't walk in with a camera.  Someone followed me. 
[04:25:30]  You walked in with a mic all loaded up and ready to chit-chat.  Actually, I don't know.  I think someone brought me the mic, but I...  Who brought you the mic?  Who brought you the mic?  I don't think someone brought it to you.  You didn't jump into your hands.  Who brought you?  Did you say, I'm going to go in now and make a disturbance?  No, I didn't really want it to be a disturbance.  All right, so do what you want to do to Jay.  No, no, no.  Who brought you the mic?  Let's do it.  Just do it.  I think it was Eric from that corner.  No, I know.  I hope he wants to see...  Don't look flapping up.  No, Bobby, no.  Bobby, just do what you have to do.  Bobby, no, don't.  Just do it.  Because I hope he wants me to punch you because he wants it to go so far off the tracks that 
[04:26:00]  it's a good show again.  It's all right, Bobby.  Go.  I just wanted to say, you know, it's all...  Stay from over there.  All right, just keep moving over.  Come on, Bobby.  Have some guts.  Do your thing.  Let's see what kind of balls you have.  You put his asshole in your face, stupid.  That's right.  Put his cock in your mouth.  He has no respect for you.  It's all cool.  You know, I just...  You know, I'll climb his hands.  Fucking nervous idiot.  Do I lose my teeth for a moment in the sun?  Fucking, he put his dick in your ear and you're just going to wave at him?  You want to talk to him?  You talk to him.  He'll kill me.  Can you give him a hand shake? 
[04:26:30]  You're not dying, Bobby.  I had fun playing cockle balls.  Cocker sack.  Cocker sack.  It's cocker sack.  That was like six hours ago, it seems like.  I think it's genius, the amount of disdain in your correction.  It's cocker sack.  Yeah.  Well, get it right.  Really.  How about when he showed his peach and it looked like a fucking plump?  A black man ball.  I've been told that black ball.  It did look like Vicky Lamotta's eye. 
[04:27:00]  Hey, where's Roland?  I'm a bum without you in a helmet.  What'd you say?  Father of the bride.  Again?  Father of the bride.  Get Roland.  I want to see if he smoothed things over.  Don't start.  Uh-oh.  All right, Roland's coming back in.  Let's see if he smoothed things over.  I bet we're fine.  I'm sure we're fine.  You can say.  She's also got other people going like, come on, we got to go.  You got to, hi, I got nothing, because there's a moderator.  Let's see what happens.  But they listen in on everything, right?  Yeah, they do.  Of course they do.  Yeah, that's awful.  Well, then they would have hung up the minute I said colored.  Roland, the guy who books all the guests for our show. 
[04:27:30]  Roland.  Hello.  How is it?  How long have you been working here?  I've been booking here since November.  He's good.  Jump out that window.  I represent.  Yeah, I'm trying.  What is our office full of helium?  Well, it shouldn't be too bad.  Are you high-pitched, Eric?  No.  No.  All right, what's going on?  All right, it shouldn't be too bad, though.  We should be fine.  Where'd Bobby go?  Do helium Howard.  That's good.  Cool, Robin.  I invented everything.  Cool.  I'm taking the helicopter out to the Hamptons. 
[04:28:00]  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.  All right, how'd it go with the publicist?  Yeah, let's go.  Tell him, Fred.  I shot her an email.  We're going to, I'm going to give her a call and talk to her later on.  She said, talk to me immediately, and then you email and she doesn't pick it up?  What's going to be your angle on this?  Yeah, what's your angle after hearing the replay?  I'm trying to think of a good answer.  Sorry, but they're pigs.  Just say they were upset because he called late.  Just say it's out of control.  It's five guys in a room.  It's fucking XM radio.  You say whatever you want, and they go crazy.  I don't understand why you guys are conspiring on the air. 
[04:28:30]  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.  You're talking about this is what you say.  You forget your own ear.  She's like, I heard you.  We've never been known for our brains.  What was your bit?  What did you walk in here to do that you just completely backed out of?  Yeah.  And if you say I just wanted to say something, I'll fucking spit my gum in your hat.  No, I didn't.  Shut your face.  Tell the truth.  Come on.  I was just going to say that it was fun hanging out with Jay. 
[04:29:00]  Oh, you're so needy.  But he's lying because he had a thing he was going to do.  He came over and he reached for me in a lecky way.  No, it wasn't really a lecky way.  Put the mic in your mouth like you're blowing.  What were you going to do?  Just say what you were going to do.  All the way in.  Put it in.  And let Jimmy smash it.  You walked in here with the timing of cancer of the gums while he's in the middle of talking.  I don't say that.  You know it's you.  And you were going to stand over there and do something and you didn't do it.  What were you going to do?  Not that.  It wasn't, you know, I was just going to hang out.  He's not being honest.  Okay, go. 
[04:29:30]  He's not going to tell the truth.  He's not telling the truth.  Go.  What were you going to do?  Nothing.  He's not going to tell the truth.  Go.  Are you going to lie?  I talk about fucking, I got blown by a tranny.  I can say that.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  I'm chewing gum.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  Who are you thinking?  Show me with your mouth.  TK Club?  Show me with your mouth.  Show me, you fuck.  This bitch should come out.  What is that from?  What was that?  Bad Lieutenant.  Very beautiful girls, you know that?  Bad Lieutenant.  Who were you tonight?  The KK Club?  Smoking grass?  I know what you did. 
[04:30:00]  That's a good one.  I just remember him, like, being naked, crying.  If I can play...  I tried to do the right thing for me.  Where the fuck are we?  Where the fuck are you?  I'm sorry.  Why did he give the fucking...  I did some of my bad things.  He's great.  I can't wait until Ben has this breakdown.  Why?  Now, when...  Why did he give the money to the bad guys who killed the...  That it was him, like his...  Redemption. 
[04:30:30]  Okay, I thought so.  Yeah.  I picked that up.  Did you get a shot?  Huh?  Hey, cop!  Big man.  Biggest man in town.  Get some fucking kiss of death.  We got to get Richard Widmark drops immediately.  I want him before the show's over.  Go.  Now.  Hit it.  What are you blackberrying, Opie?  Because this is important.  Oh, I finished the show.  Oh, you're done with the show?  You know, I'm fucking done with this show, too.  Why don't we just go?  I'm just doing the stuff I do at...  It's fucking almost noon.  What are we doing here?  Opie's just doing stuff he does after the show.  I already started doing my post-show stuff. 
[04:31:00]  What time are you guys usually on the air?  I don't know.  11.  Then we'll complain that no guests come on.  We'll go, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Now we know why.  And this is going to be forced down our throat every time we don't get a guest now.  Well, remember what you did.  We had 25 fucking great interviews with everyone else that came in, but this will be the one  they call on every time.  Remember you called the publicist Cuntour?  Jay Moore did.  It wasn't Cuntour.  Jay Moore did.  It was Cunt Bitch.  And we will be saying that a lot in the next couple of hours.  Cunt Bitch Whore.  Whore was in there.  It was good seeing you guys.  I don't know where.  Oh, Moore. 
[04:31:30]  Thanks for having me, sir.  Yes, thank you very much.  Wow, this is like...  July 21st, Clerks 2.  That's right.  I'm going to check it out.  Excellent to be here.  All right.  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton's going to be at some funny place with a funny name doing funny stuff.  I look like I'm booking Nashville for the end of July, but that's not it.  It's about June 11th.  Lucky Louie.  Jay Moore.  Thank you.  Anything to plug, Jay?  Tuesdays at the Irvine Improv.  Irvine Improv.  Big Kev, anything?  Wizard World Philly next weekend.  That's a no. 
[04:32:00]  Wizard World Philly next weekend.  Yeah, this is Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  What are you doing there?  I'm signing on Saturday.  Ah, very good.  Kevin's doing a signing in Wizard World in Philadelphia.  Are there other celebrities going to be there?  Yes, but I haven't looked at the guest list yet.  You might want to.  Like, who do we got?  I'm going.  You're going?  All right, well, then that's a winner.  Because some of the guest lists I've seen.  Probably Lou Ferrigno.  No doubt.  That's the usual.  Can you fucking write down why he didn't call us and show it to him and see if he can give  you an answer?  Because he stood us up and we were in Mardi Gras.  Thank God we were at Mardi Gras.  Couldn't hear anything.  We were as deaf as he was. 
[04:32:30]  I'm not sure.  She doesn't frequent those things.  No, we got her once.  She does chill her.  She does chill her.  Yeah, we got her once.  And then all we did was yell, the power of Christ compels you into the mic.  And she hung up on us.  Thanks a lot for that.  We thought it was funny.  That was kind of funny.  Yeah, what are we going to do?  Sir, always a pleasure being here.  Thank you.  Anytime I'm in New York, I hope I can just come on in.  You know you're welcome anytime.  Sometimes I like to talk.  Sometimes I just like to watch.  Just sit and be an observer. 
[04:33:00]  That's fine.  More is fine.  You talk more at the FM show.  Yeah, totally.  But it's fun to just kind of watch more.  Well, there's not much else you can do.  You know, the guy does kind of go from one subject to another.  He's very funny.  I wish he'd do stand-up again.  Yeah, that was weird to hear.  I think it's more a psychological thing.  That was weird to hear that he's just not.  Like he goes, I'm retired.  And you're like, well, why?  You're really funny and everything.  And then he goes, nah, I just don't like it anymore.  I think there might be a stage fright thing or something.  No.  I think something that hit him.  He seems like a fairly straightforward guy. 
[04:33:30]  And he just kind of hit a place where he's like, I'm tired of getting up there.  I think it's fairly funny where he's like, I've been talking for 15 minutes.  You guys say something.  I understand if like you're a carpenter or something or you got a job you don't like.  All right.  And then you move on to something else.  But stand-up comedy.  I mean, you know, I think it's tough too if you've been acting.  And you get to do that for a living.  And then you have to go back on a stage and like please people in a moment in a room.  Yeah.  It's kind of tough.  It's kind of tough.  I kind of hear that.  Well, thank you. 
[04:34:00]  Thank you.  For coming.  And I officially have to be the last person left in here.  I was going to say, all right.  Because I think that might be the bit.  If I don't see you outside, I'm late for lunch.  You're late for lunch.  Anybody important?  Or just yourself?  Janet Maslin.  Used to review movies for the New York Times.  Nice little schmoozing.  Isn't it?  Yes, yes.  I dig her.  She's a cool lady.  So whenever I'm in New York, I try to see her.  Slip a little copy of the advanced copy of the movie?  She saw it.  Yeah?  Yeah, she already saw it.  Yeah, she dug it.  Okay.  All right, boss.  Continued success, my friend.  Yes, you too.  There goes Kevin Smith. 
[04:34:30]  And Big Kev.  And stupid camera guy that's filming nothing that ends up nowhere.  Get the fuck out of here.  Why?  We have eight billion rolls of videotape.  If I could call them rolls like it's fucking 1955.  There's eight billion miles of videotape that never shows up anywhere, and it's of nothing.  Where is me sitting here with no one else in the studio going to end up on a website  that people are going to go, oh, I got to download that? 
[04:35:00]  It took five hours and 40 minutes.  Yeah.  Now it's just me and you.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's start the Opie and Anthony show.  You want to start over again?  Let's just start over again.  Let's just start over.  I'm willing to sit here for four hours and do a real show.  A real show?  Yeah.  Cue the music.  That has nothing to do with ADD.  I want to do a show.  Even Kevin Smith was horrified at the end of that program.  Kevin Smith is just like, I love being an observer sitting here watching a show derail.  And now Jimmy's back.  All right.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy, we're staying for four more hours. 
[04:35:30]  We're going to do a show.  We're going to start the program.  We have to give these people a program.  All right.  Hit it.  No?  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  We got lots to do on the program today, I got to tell you.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Barry Bonds hit his 715th homer. 
[04:36:00]  Congrats.  The local broadcast in San Francisco did not get the call.  You kidding?  They missed that?  Yeah.  We got audio of that.  I didn't even hear about that.  And we'll be playing in a little while.  Also, no guests today, by the way.  We have no guests on the show.  So it's just going to be us.  Yeah.  We're listening to what they're saying on the message boards.  And we realize that guests slow us down.  So no guests today.  No guests.  And Patrice, by the way, I heard made some girl cry.  She was at Big A's date or something like that.  Oh, I can't wait to hear about that.  Maybe Big A will call in.  Yeah.  We're going to have Big A call in. 
[04:36:30]  Hopefully he had some kind of a date to the Patrice O'Neill show.  And she ran off crying.  And we'd love someone to call in and compare that to Stern.  We dare you.  That's right.  Holy shit, that fart stinks.  Wow.  What an awful.  You know, I'd be willing to sit and do a whole show.  Now I'm really.  But now I can because Jimmy farted.  And it really is awful.  All right.  Well.  It is really horrible.  I wanted to get into Ship Wife.  It wasn't a suicide.  Exceptional opening.  We had a jogger snatches his dog out of alligator's mouth. 
[04:37:00]  Then you got the Angelina, Brad Pitt baby drama where the thing is like, you know, pollutions all over the place.  The whole new Jennifer Anderson movie.  The funny photo shoot and the kids.  Jail pimp hopes to lock up film deal.  Maybe we can get him to call in.  Maybe he'll call in.  There was.  But yeah, Angelina and Brad. 
[04:37:30]  A kid.  Yeah.  How about that?  The adopting and all the royalty.  Well, always with the kids.  Hold on.  Let's flip through the paper.  We got the prep sheet here.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  We got this guy.  iPods are going to have IDs to battle theft.  But yeah, the last comic standing for begins tonight.  Is this true?  Taylor Hicks might be calling in?  No, that won't be happening.  I heard the X-Men had a big opening and the Goonit mom members.  Record setting.  The Goonit members' mom shoots people. 
[04:38:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I heard Bobby's going to do some funny no-homo stuff that he'll bail on at the end probably because, you know.  He's an attention whore.  He is, but he doesn't want to follow through with anything.  Yeah, he runs in because he thought it would get a big response.  What happened?  Tipsy Teen in Crazy Joyride.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  I'm just reading headlines.  This is a cute story.  Miami Beach, Florida.  A man killed his two young children Saturday by throwing them off the 15th floor of a landmark South Beach hotel and then jumped to his own death. 
[04:38:30]  Oh, that's kind of fun.  We got to do some impressions with that.  Yeah.  And then we'll do a little something later in the show and self-destruct kind of a little bit like we tend to do.  You know something?  I have had it with today.  Yeah, me too.  Had it.  You're missing out on 15 minutes of program now that we would have given you.  And that's it.  It's the O&A show.  It's over.  We'll see you tomorrow at 6 o'clock on our FM stations and our XM. 
[04:39:00]  And hope you enjoyed the show.  Otto and George tomorrow?  Really?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Great.  Do you remember how that went last time?  No.  Otto left the fucking show.  He's nuts, but he's still very funny.  He left the show in the middle of the show.  He said he was getting coffee.  He was getting coffee.  We saw him by the coffee machine.  He left.  Ten minutes later, the puppet right out behind him.  I stink.  That was pretty good.  I was trying.  It would have been good if he didn't stop.  Ten minutes later, the puppet.  Ten minutes later, the puppet.  Cell phone call and then left. 
[04:39:30]  Food, all right.  Try the club soda.  Yeah.  Great.  Otto and George.  What time are they scheduled for?  Is that going to be XM, right?  Free FM first.  They're not going to.  He's not doing FM first.  Talk to Ben.  There's no way he can do that first.  I think so.  I say we try.  I agree.  I say we try and, you know, see what happens.  I think the walkover will be very interesting.  Don't drink day.  I want to talk to you.  Can't be any worse than today. 
[04:40:00]  No, today's walkover was pretty good because it was like, let's see what can happen if we  remove all humor and interesting commentary.  Yeah, everything.  You should have known.  What is this?  What does that say?  New replay scheduled today.  Atta boy, Dan.  I like the new hairdo, too.  This boy's life.  Fucking beat it.  I know a thing or two about nothing.  There is a new replay schedule.  Hope you're announcing on steroids and when the show is over, then the other one starts  right away.  Yeah, but...  So it'll be the CBS show and then right after the XM starts and then right after the XM show, 
[04:40:30]  guess what?  The CBS show will start again.  Just like real life.  It's playing.  It's supposed to play in the same order.  And all that filler stuff you hear in the morning, if you're listening to us live, is now drastically  reduced.  Gonzo.  Drastically reduced.  Drastically reduced.  I've had it.  Drastically reduced.  Drastically reduced.  It's going to be the show.  That's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. </pre>
