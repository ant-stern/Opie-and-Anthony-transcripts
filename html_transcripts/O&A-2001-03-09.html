<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a prolonged prank on intern John, involving numerous absurd errands (lunch, cutlery, water, chips, coffee, sushi) spanning two hours.  John initially downplayed his frustration but later admitted to feeling overwhelmed.  The prankâ€™s success was discussed alongside listener calls detailing similar workplace and military hazing.  The conversation unexpectedly shifted to morticians' practices, including a call with a funeral director clarifying misconceptions and another claiming bodies were washed with Brillo pads. This segment transitioned into the show's "F.U. Friday" segment, announcing Bill Dwyer from *BattleBots* as a guest.

The show then delved into a rambling discussion of Opie's chaotic family vacation to upstate New York.  His brothers, Elmo and Brett, called in, contributing to the increasingly bizarre narrative involving a large family, a mysterious girl named Karen, extensive cement work (possibly related to their father's "cement fetish"), a near-drowning, a dilapidated insect-infested inherited property, and a stay in a creepy cabin.  Their calls added equally outlandish childhood stories, including a boyfriend living in their attic, shared bathwater, and a bathtub fight. Listener calls included one about joining the Marines to escape pumping gas, only to find themselves pumping gas into jets.  Bill Dwyer from *BattleBots* joined the show, and the conversation veered towards strip clubs, body glitter, and Giuliani's impact on Times Square.  The segment concluded with more "F.U. Friday" calls and was punctuated throughout with vulgar language, including homophobic and misogynistic slurs.

The conversation with Bill Dwyer continued, focusing initially on *BattleBots*, specifically the lack of attractive women in the audience. This led to a discussion about relative attractiveness, with studio guest Old Dirty Bastard (ODB) joining the conversation. ODB shared anecdotes about New York City, building maintenance, and the lack of public restrooms.  The discussion ranged from David Caruso's acting to Giuliani's personality, ODB's marital status and experiences with divorce, and immigration and marriage for financial gain.  Topics included the attractiveness of Heidi Mark (*BattleBots* reporter), detailed descriptions of female anatomy, *BattleBots* mechanics, and ODB's yo-yo skills.  The power sources of *BattleBots* (wheelchair motors and pneumatics) and favorite robots were also discussed.

ODB then attempted his "Old Dirty Observations" (ODO) segment, with significant banter and interruptions from the hosts and guests (OPAC and Sean Colt were also present).  ODB's ODOs included comedic observations on Asian drivers, the XFL, The Notorious B.I.G.'s death, and the IRS.  This was followed by further discussion of ODB's experiences, including a traffic stop, and promotion of Dwyer's comedy shows. The entire segment featured extensive offensive language.

The "F.U. Friday" segment featured numerous angry listener messages targeting Long Island women, weathermen, and slow drivers.  The hosts engaged in vulgar and sexually explicit discussions. Bill Dwyer received plugs for his shows. A caller, Ryan, distraught over his girlfriend, drug use, and job loss, prompted a lengthy, often crude and insensitive conversation, including suggestions about heroin use.  A recording of Ryan's ex-girlfriend was played, and her current boyfriend called in.  A "What I Learned Today" segment followed, featuring ridiculous and offensive anecdotes.  The show promoted an upcoming "Best Ass Contest" with a Las Vegas trip as the prize, concluding with more "F.U." messages.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Bring on the next one.  Daddy, can I suck on your candy?  Make a teen nymph.  Isn't this illegal?  Look what you did to me again.  There are people that think that you and I should be going to jail.  I thought we were just having fun.  Yeah, we're having fun.  Do they get ratings books in prison?  1027.  WNEW.  It's the O&A Show.  Hey, good afternoon.  Where's my damn coffee? 
[00:00:30]  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  You need that number if you listen to this radio show.  Where do we begin today, Anthony?  Well, we were just all hanging out in the office.  A lot of people back there today.  Having fun, sure.  Everybody's here. 
[00:01:00]  I've got to get Stinky in here because Stinky says that one of the interns is acting up.  What's the problem?  I don't know.  Get Stinky off the phone.  Stinky, what's the problem?  John says he's got a problem today.  He just looks depressed.  John's got a problem?  He keeps talking about, oh, they're making me do this, get coffee.  Like you're an intern.  That's what you've got to do.  What are you saying?  What were you saying?  He was avoiding the office at the end of the, before the show.  I was wondering where you went, John. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, you kind of disappeared.  Yeah, you could talk.  I was definitely, I was like, I was down there just trying to eat my lunch.  I mean, I have no problem with doing whatever.  Send me to do whatever you want.  John, you're from Seton Hall, right?  Yes, I am.  You've been interning for how long?  About two and a half months.  Oh, wow.  We're just starting to notice you.  That's weird.  You've been here two and a half months.  No, but Stinky said that you were yelling and screaming and getting a little pissed off at us.  See, no, it couldn't have been more opposite.  If anything, I was just...  John, wait, you're a fan of our show before you came here, right? 
[00:02:00]  Sure.  Speak freely.  What's the problem?  Stinky goes, Stinky comes in the office going, dude, I don't know what you guys did to John,  but he is pissed off.  He's down there ranting and raving, saying, you go get the shortcut.  No, definitely not.  If anything, I was just sitting there being absolutely quiet, and I was like...  You know what I mean?  I stink.  What happened when I asked you to get my Cokes?  You were like...  You had me running around all over.  That was my explanation for why you didn't have your Cokes. 
[00:02:30]  And I just caught him bitching to Jesse, the other intern, when I came out of the bathroom.  He's like, goddammit, you were totally talking about us.  No, that's why you changed your subject, trying to pretend like nothing's wrong when I call  and you see me come around.  Jesse?  Jesse?  Let's get it out in the open.  Yeah.  He wasn't bitching about all over.  What did he say?  Nothing.  I know you guys are pals, but come on.  He didn't bitch about it.  If you guys have a problem with us...  He was just pointing out that he was doing a lot.  He wasn't pissed about it.  John, you feel like you did a lot today?  I feel like I was running around a lot, sure, but not like... 
[00:03:00]  Running around?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  I would...  I went to Ralph's, right?  You went to Ralph's, sure.  Well, Ralph's is a place we get lunch.  I just want to fill everyone in.  That's about three blocks away.  Okay, which is not a problem at all.  Okay.  All right.  So you went to Ralph's, yeah.  And what else?  Let's see.  What did I do after that?  And I came back.  Mm-hmm.  And I came down here to help Stinky with some editing that he was doing or whatever.  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh, Opie, you wanted a spoon, I guess?  No, a fork.  I believe it was a fork. 
[00:03:30]  I'm sorry.  Well, dude, you didn't bring...  You didn't bring a fork for everybody.  Wait, no.  Well, Ben...  Opie broke it.  Hold on, hold on.  Ben, get on mic.  I...  I did ask for a fork.  And everyone got really pissed at me in the back of the office.  No, you called the...  You called the warm one.  You called Ron and Fez.  And you said, hey, it's Opie.  Get you on.  I want a fork.  The Ron and Fez guy that does the phones or whatever came in and asked Stinky, and he's like,  wait, no, Opie was asking for John to run back there and get a fork or something, so  I ran right back there.  All right, so you had to get lunch three blocks away, and you got me a fork, and that's why... 
[00:04:00]  No, no, no.  And that was too much today?  No, I'm not mad at all.  There's nothing...  No problems whatsoever.  Well, what happened after that?  What else?  I don't know.  Let's see.  Then I came back.  I sat down to eat my lunch, and then I went down, got your spoon, got your fork, and then  Rick gave me...  Oh, yeah.  I asked for a spoon for my pudding.  Yes, exactly.  I forgot about that.  And then Rick sent me upstairs with the cell phone.  Yeah, you brought one of those cheesy plastic forks.  But you had to get a second fork, because the first one you got me broke.  Opie's fork broke.  The big, thick, plastic see-through one. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, I had to get up from his lunch again and get another fork for Opie.  Right.  And then...  Did you finish your lunch?  I haven't touched it.  What time did you get it?  One o'clock.  Two hours ago?  You can't figure out when to eat?  What else?  Because now you're going to eat while the show's going on.  I don't understand what else there was that made you miss your lunch.  I don't know, and then Rick sent me upstairs with the cell phone to call down and let him  know what was in the vending machine or whatever.  Uh-huh.  And like, I did that.  Well, I didn't want you to, you know, bring me the wrong candy or whatever.  Oh, of course.  Not at all.  And then, uh...  What else? 
[00:05:00]  And I came down for two seconds, sat down, started eating my lunch, and I can't remember  all the different errands.  Well, Anthony made you go back upstairs to get the potato chips.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, the potato chips.  And that was after we had you go upstairs to get the water for everybody in the office,  right?  Yeah.  But, like, I wasn't mad or anything.  And I hope he sent you out for sushi.  Yeah, that's right, sir.  That was, uh...  But that was after we sent him to get coffee, which is three blocks the other way from the  house.  Right.  Right.  But we always get coffee before the show, right?  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  I'm not mad.  Now, Stinky, you used to have to do stuff like this. 
[00:05:30]  I don't always complain about it.  I know.  I wasn't complaining.  Like, every day I was doing all that.  Right.  You've just seen before I asked him, like, what's the matter?  Because he was just staring in the blank.  He was like, oh, nothing, nothing.  So you got your lunch over two hours ago?  Yeah.  And you haven't been able to eat it?  No.  And so you feel like we sent you on a wild goose chase?  Absolutely not.  John, you're a pussy.  Because if we did, you've got to tell us we did.  Yeah.  Well, okay, let's say for the first, like, two or three...  Don't be kind. 
[00:06:00]  You know this show.  I would have more respect for you if you spoke your mind right now.  Well, because obviously there's a problem.  Stinky came running in the office going, dude, I don't know what you guys did to John, but  he's pissed.  And we've never seen you pass.  Well, for the first, like, two or three, I was like, all right, you know, maybe I just...  What are the two or three?  The Ralphs?  The Ralphs?  That's fine.  You went upstairs, what, four or five times?  Six or seven.  Six or seven times?  And I was like, it got to the point after, like, maybe an hour and 15 minutes, I was  like, all right, maybe something might be going on.  I thought maybe it might be like, all right, let's just see how much stuff we can send them 
[00:06:30]  on, possibly.  But, you know, who am I to make that assumption?  I'm just an intern.  Well, we have a list of...  Because then I was...  When Stinky told me that you were pissed, that we were making you run around a little  bit, I had Ben make a list.  And it turns out you did about 20 things for us the last two hours.  Is it literally 20?  Yeah.  Well, everything from getting everyone lunch.  Get Pete.  What was that?  To get Pete.  Yeah.  You had to get me two forks on two different occasions. 
[00:07:00]  You had to get me a spoon.  You had to get Anthony potato chips.  You had to go upstairs for water twice.  You had to go to the vending machine upstairs again after you came back down to get Rick's  candy bar.  Then we made you go get coffee, which is three blocks the other way from Ralphs.  And then we made you get sushi just before the show.  And he also forgot, I asked him to get some stuff off the printer, but if you had to do  that, you missed that on one.  I got the rock news.  No, no, no.  Well, actually, yeah, we haven't printed the rock news, but also there's other stuff that  I printed that you didn't get.  Oh, really? 
[00:07:30]  So you're 50-50 on that.  Kelly, another one of our interns checking in.  Kelly.  Hi.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  This kind of stuff never happens when I'm working.  There's no complaining.  You just do it, right, Kelly?  Yeah, with a smile.  You do it with a smile and you're like, well, I'm so happy I'm here doing the radio show,  all right?  That's right.  There you go.  See you later, guys.  But for some reason, John had a problem today.  I had no problems.  I don't know what everybody's talking about.  Stay.  I think it's been accumulating, too, because, you know, last time he was in, it was kind 
[00:08:00]  of, he was sleeping at one point.  Oh, yeah.  No, that's completely unfounded propaganda and rumors.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Shoot, I caught you with your eyes closed.  Okay, well, maybe sort of once.  Well, if you had a run all over the, you know, Manhattan for us.  Oh, but some of the listeners are getting upset.  Why?  You two are becoming prima donnas.  You two are coming off as jerks.  Hmm.  Interesting.  I guess we should tell John then that we were hazing you today.  You were being so ragged, man. 
[00:08:30]  Every time you came into the office, one of us, it was one of our jobs to send you out  to do something else.  We wanted to see how many things you would do before you would pitch.  You couldn't even imagine how hard it was to keep from laughing when we were asking  you for stuff, but the second you walked out of the office, we all started just laughing  our asses off.  The game was, the game was very simple.  Didn't you notice that as soon as you got back, it was someone else asking for something?  Yeah, and like every time somebody would ask me something different, like I'd have to  fight so hard to not like roll my eyes and just be like, are you serious? 
[00:09:00]  See?  You did have a problem.  It started by going to Ralph's to get lunch, and then you came back, and then I started  by asking you for a fork, which was just a major hassle.  And then you come back, and then...  Lovie actually broke his fork.  He got the little plastic fork first, the little white one, and we were looking for scissors  to cut one of the prongs off with, so when you come back, you can go, my fork's broken,  and you should get another one.  And then it was Anthony's turn to make you get the potato chips, so you go upstairs to get  the potato chips. 
[00:09:30]  And when you went, I'm just like, you left the office, and I said to Lovie, I go, this  is awful, man.  This is so nasty.  And then you came back down with the potato chips, and then I think that's when Ben said,  could you go upstairs and get water?  Yes.  Which was the exact same place where the vending machine is.  And you have to go through like three locked doors to get to the vending machine.  It's such a pain in the ass.  And don't forget transferring me to promotions when I was on the cell phone.  Oh, yeah.  Well, then you came back down.  You came back down with the water, and then that was Rick's turn to go, hey, John, I need  a candy bar, man. 
[00:10:00]  Go right back where the water is.  Right back where the water was, right back where the potato chips was.  He could have done all this in one trip.  We made him do it a lot of times.  And every time you sent me for something different, I'll be like, dude, like, I'm sorry.  You're like, yeah.  I'm so sincere.  Dude, I'm really sorry.  You're going to kill me, man.  One more thing.  Oh, is he not sorry?  Every two seconds, we're like, this is so great.  What can we do next?  Yeah, and then you're at the vending machine.  We made you call down on a cell phone and read off everything that's in the vending machine  so we could figure out what else we wanted.  Then you came down with the candy bar, and then where did we send them? 
[00:10:30]  And then the basic stuff, like getting printouts and stuff.  And then, like, John, you know.  Then it was coffee time.  Yeah, then it was coffee time, and usually we just get coffee downstairs.  It's easy and painless.  You know, I want some of that Phillips coffee today, which is all the way the other way,  which has a sign that's about the size of a napkin outside of it.  Right.  And, dude, the best part, just before you ask him for the coffee,  he looks at me with these, like, little doggy eyes like, am I done yet? 
[00:11:00]  He goes, can I?  Can I?  Yeah.  Go eat my lunch.  Can I eat my lunch now?  I'm like, I don't know.  You better talk to Opa.  I think he needed something.  His lunch is sitting there.  Yeah, and I was old.  I was trying so hard to, like, pass it off to Jesse.  I was like, but doesn't Jesse need to learn where this place is?  Doesn't he need to go get coffee?  No, I was like, no, John, we need you to do it.  And then, literally, like, ten minutes before the show, I sent you out to get sushi.  And the whole time, I kept checking in with Stink.  I'm like, Stink, is he pissed yet?  No, no, no, not yet.  And then, finally, he exploded. 
[00:11:30]  I said, you looked beaten there for a while.  There you go, John.  Oh, you never get sushi ten minutes before the show starts.  We spent so much money.  And you even gave me the option.  You're like, do you want to just go eat your lunch and get it for the first break?  I'm like, no, don't worry about it.  Yeah, I know.  Giving you that option, you were still going to go get the sushi.  I was just trying to look like I'm a nice guy.  So, wait, I'm hazed.  Like, am I in the fraternity now?  We hazed you today, which basically means you're doing a really good job for us. 
[00:12:00]  Thanks, Opa.  All right.  John, thank you.  Very good.  It was so painful, though, watching him walk out of the office.  Just painful.  Over and over again.  He would walk all the way down the hall.  I mean, this building is huge.  Hey, who hasn't had jobs where people made you do that for real?  And you're just like, yeah, okay, because you'd want to make points and stuff.  And then you're just like, this son of a bitch.  You freaking get up off your own ass and get your own effing fork.  He would go all the way to the other side of the floor. 
[00:12:30]  And that's when we would call him and go, John, can you come down here?  We need something.  The fork was the worst, man.  You see what I'm saying, Opie, it's not sealed in plastic.  Is that okay for you, Opie?  Sure.  The fork.  And then when he brought you the other fork, you're inspecting it.  Where'd you get this?  Yeah, I'm like, ah, it looks dirty.  It looks like it's a used fork.  Terrible.  Well, you passed the test.  Thank you.  And we're not prima donnas.  We're just messing with our pal there.  Yeah.  We're ball busters.  Don't worry about it.  All right, Ant, let's take our first break, okay? 
[00:13:00]  All right.  And we'll get into the real show.  All right.  We just had to play that out.  This is too funny.  Cool.  It was going on for the last two hours.  Yeah.  Painful.  Painful to watch.  Stinky loved it.  It's official.  Stinky's not the lone man on the totem pole anymore.  Oh, hell no.  All right.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Other debossery on the way.  Stay there.  1027-WNEW.  Let's go right to the phone and say hi to Frank. 
[00:13:30]  Frank, what's going on?  Oh, man.  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  I don't know how to put up with you guys.  Oh, come on.  You think you were sabotaging me guys a little along the way?  It was two straight hours, Frank.  Two straight hours.  And every time we send them on the streets of New York, you've got to get in an elevator.  We're on, like, the 9th, 10th floor here.  Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.  It really is a pain in the ass just to leave the building to get a lousy cup of coffee.  You didn't spit in anything, did you?  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  I would have. 
[00:14:00]  I know you guys definitely would have done a little egg flack in the coffee or something.  A little chocolate flavor.  I don't know.  He looks relieved that it was all a joke.  Oh, that's cool.  Because he didn't understand what the hell was going on.  You guys got them excellent, so you got them excellent points.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Have a good weekend.  Liz, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to see if John could go get me some tampons.  He wouldn't mind just one more trip out there, right?  Nothing worse than when you ladies saddle us with that one. 
[00:14:30]  Go get some tampons.  They go through the little list.  Yeah, pick up some milk and stuff.  Oh, could you get some tampons?  Oh, Liz.  Super absorbency.  We pushed him right to the edge.  He was ready to start screaming at everybody.  That was great.  You guys are all...  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to Mike, who...  Mike.  Hey, what's going on?  You're John's frat brother?  Yes, I am.  From Seton Hall?  Yes, sir.  And what do you have to say today?  Well, when he was pledging, we used to wake his ass up around 4 o'clock in the morning 
[00:15:00]  and send him to McDonald's on the parkway to get us, like, a number two super-size and stuff.  And the man never complained, never bitched, nothing.  Yeah, he held it together until the end.  I'm pretty impressed.  I was listening to it.  I couldn't believe it.  I said, wow, I'm impressed.  Yeah, he's one of those guys that'll just, you know, he'll go with the flow.  But I think behind the scenes, it's like, mother of course.  He's prima donna.  I'm bringing a gun in now on Tuesday.  It's like, uh-oh. 
[00:15:30]  Stinky, is this what you had to deal with?  All right, Mike.  All right, you guys suck.  Thank you.  Let's go to Kurt.  Kurt, what's going on?  Oh, hey.  Hey, buddy.  Here's a story.  We're in a local fight up on the right, and we're killing time.  And so the new guy's in the room, and we figure out how we're going to get him.  So off the top of one of the guy's heads, he says, we were at a call yesterday, and we  left one of our tools there, and we need to replace this thing.  Yeah.  So the name of the tool is an oxygen key. 
[00:16:00]  You know, it turns on the oxygen.  So they change the name to this off-the-wall, left-handed O2 key.  So they tell the guy, listen, go to the next fire department, the next town over, and ask  if you can borrow one.  That old guy.  It's like a left-handed screwdriver.  He drives over to the firehouse and asks for this left-handed O2 key.  So you've got to know that when you see this young kid asking for this tool, that something's  not right.  So they take it to the next level, and they say, no, you know what?  We're actually out of them.  But the next town over definitely has one.  So we're sitting at the firehouse waiting for him to come back all upset. 
[00:16:30]  He goes to the next town, and he asks, do you guys have a left-handed O2 key?  You know, they sent me how to get this thing.  So this guy figures, yeah, yeah, sure, I got one.  Hang tight one sec.  Goes in the back, wraps up this package, says, here it is.  Hold on to it.  Bring it back.  Don't open it until you get there.  So we're sitting waiting half an hour later.  The guy comes back, and he unwraps the package, and we're all washing them, and it's a piece  of wood that says, you dumb dick on it.  Oh, was that good?  I love hazing stories. 
[00:17:00]  Thanks, Kurt.  All right.  All right, buddy.  That's good.  Yeah, the fire guys, they know how to.  Oh, yeah, there's certain groups that just know how to rag their pals.  Eric, what's going on?  How are you doing?  Good.  Turn on the radio.  I felt, you know, John deserves a pat on the back for all that hazing.  No, now he's really happy.  Well, let's make him a little happier.  I think he deserves to eat his lunch off of Knife Girl's belly.  Oh, not a bad idea.  Give it a try.  I think he deserves it, you know?  All right, Eric, thank you. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, you got an interning hazing story?  Yeah, I was doing video work for a company.  The director comes in.  He feels like he doesn't want to switch the cameras.  So he tells me, he picks me up.  I'm on a job like two weeks.  I don't know what the hell I'm doing.  Sends me down in front of the control panel.  Says, you switch the cameras when I tell you to.  So instead of him actually saying camera one, camera two, or whatever,  he decides to kick the back of my chair. 
[00:18:00]  That's why he tells me I have to switch the cameras.  So all for four hours, all I do is just kick in the back of my back.  Just blam.  Okay, camera one.  Wham.  Camera two.  Wham.  Camera three.  Ridiculous.  I'm so mad.  I couldn't turn around, though.  The guy's like my client.  I want to get more work from him.  Yeah.  He's just sitting back there smiling, eating the whole thing up.  I knew it.  Hey, that's good.  It doesn't work much anymore, though, I don't think.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Back.  The phone's exploding with hazing stories.  Al, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[00:18:30]  Hey, Al.  Listen, I used to work in a restaurant all the time.  African-American dudes would come in, the whole family, get a drink, all one at a time.  You're running back and forth.  Can I get some fries?  Can I get some ketchup?  You have three, four tables.  All you're able to take care of is one.  They just bought you all on purpose.  What?  You mean coming in and their customers and then the waitstaff has to run around like  crazy, satisfying them?  That's right.  You know, you're trying, you're trying, and then you're coming back.  Every time you're back, they need something else.  Can I get a glass of water? 
[00:19:00]  Hey, well, at least they leave a good tip.  Yeah, right.  That's another thing.  You're getting it like five percent.  What?  Is that a stereotype?  That's a stereotype.  It's not true, right?  Black people always tip very well, from what I hear, from people, right?  You must have heard right there.  Boys, boys, how much did the shwoogie leave?  Where's the amendment?  All right, Al, thank you.  Very nice to you.  Bye.  That's just a stereotype, Opie.  I'm sure waiters and waitresses will tell you differently. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Black people tip a lot.  Anthony.  Yes, Opie?  Oh, I'm sorry.  What's up?  How's it going?  My dad, when he first started working for a morgue, at the end of the day, when he  first started, they sent him to the back to get something, they shut the lights, and he  had to feel his way through the bodies to get out.  Get out.  He always way through the bodies.  What are they, just laying on the floor?  No, they used to hang by the ears in the back.  Stop it.  They don't just leave them out.  Hang by the ears.  Shut up.  Yes, they do.  They got to drain them in.  I'm telling you.  Do they hang them? 
[00:20:00]  Why do you like that lie to me?  I don't know if they hang them.  I know they hang them to drain them.  Years ago.  To drain them.  To drain them.  To drain them.  I saw 60.  This was years ago.  He was like a kid.  It's a morgue.  They lay them out.  No, they hang them.  No.  They hang them.  And they hang the bodies, so the fluids all, like, you know.  Go where?  It has a thing in the pan.  I'm telling you.  Oh, in the pan.  Oh, I got you.  But I don't know if they hang you from the ears, though.  Yeah, they hang them like clotheslines.  Stop it.  I know they hang the dead bodies, because the fluids all just, you know, run out of you.  I don't know.  We'll get a mortician over there. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, great.  Get the body in.  So you can say, I'm sorry, Ant.  Seriously, you never heard of that?  No.  What do you think?  They just lay them out?  I think you're laid out on a big stainless steel table with drains in it, and they put that  big friggin' needle thing in your side and drain it out that way.  Why do they have to hang people up?  They hang you.  Stop telling you.  Would you like to have my dad call you?  They hang them from the feet like a new killed buck and slit his throat.  What do you think?  Someone will back me up.  They hang the bodies.  I can't imagine that.  I'm telling you. 
[00:21:00]  I'll have my dad call if you like.  Have him call us.  I'll have him call you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  We'll get to the bottom of that.  I'm telling you, though.  I never heard they hang you from the ears, though.  From the ears?  Why would they hang them from the ears?  I'm not buying that part, but I know they hang you.  I ain't buying it.  I'm saying that they lay you down in that big stainless steel draining table.  They hang you.  What do you think?  They just poke a hole and siphon it out?  No, there's that machine.  I've seen it in movies.  They've got that big stainless steel needle thing.  It's like a half-inch diameter.  And they stick it in the side and drain it out. 
[00:21:30]  They use gravity to get the juices out of you.  Stop it.  I'm telling you.  They're laying down.  What do they hang them up by?  The neck?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  Not from the ears.  No way.  I'm not buying that.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Good.  I've had a great story.  When I was in the Navy, we were going under the Golden Gate Bridge.  And it's like an optical illusion when you're standing on deck.  It looks like the mast of the ship is going to actually hit the bridge.  Yeah.  So we sent the new guys up to the old man in the bridge and asked for the mast key so 
[00:22:00]  we could throw the mast down.  We told them, holy ass, you've got to go get the mast key.  Hurry up.  Those wacky keys.  Yeah, they ran up there.  It was great.  And then we used to tell them they had to watch for the mail buoy when we were out at sea.  The mail buoy?  Yeah.  We told them when you get mail, it comes in a big orange buoy.  I like to tell them.  And we'd have them standing out there for a couple hours in white jackets with these big boat  hooks.  I heard of this really cool Navy hazing. 
[00:22:30]  What you do is you take a submarine and surface it right under a ship.  It's really funny.  You tell the guy, yeah, just surface.  And you crack open a Jap ship.  It's really a great little maze.  Those guys don't mess anywhere on the subs, man.  Those guys are all crazy.  Hey, that's funny.  Have a good one, man.  Great talking to you.  All right, man.  There's always the key.  I remember when I was a kid and I went out to California and my father had a bunch of  horses and he hung out with all the people at the stable that had horses.  And it was always funny to make the kids do things that were just ridiculous.  Like one day, me and my brother had to move a big pile of corrugated tin from one place 
[00:23:00]  to another for no apparent reason.  Just so they could sit back, drink their big 40-ounce buds and laugh at him.  And then...  That's exactly what we were doing in the back office when John was going on all the errands.  Yeah.  We're sitting back laughing at him.  And then the tool that you use to clean the horse's hooves out, a little pick.  I'd go into the tack room to get one.  They'd go, no, no, you've got to get the right-handed one.  That's a left-handed one in your right hand.  And it's a symmetrical device.  It's not... 
[00:23:30]  There would be no difference to a left-handed one than a right-handed one.  Did you buy it, though, at that age?  Of course.  You don't want to say...  They're very intimidating, some of the people.  And then when they ask for the big horse toothbrush,  you go, go into the tack room and get the big...  It's a big toothbrush, a horse toothbrush, because his teeth are getting a little yellow.  No horse toothbrush.  So you're coming out of there with every kind of brush, the curry comb, the friggin'...  Is this it?  No, that's not.  It's in the back.  And they're just drinking and laughing.  Like little schoolgirls.  Yeah.  All right, we have a funeral director on the line. 
[00:24:00]  This better be real.  I don't want to hear any bull.  Peter.  No bull.  I'm a licensed funeral director in the state of New York.  All right, where are you right now?  I'm sitting in my car right now, actually.  I was hoping you were, like, working on a body.  No, no, actually, I'm coming back from doing a call.  What was the call today?  Well, he's...  No, it was just a removal for a funeral home up in Westchester.  You called it a removal?  Yeah, that's what it is.  That's a human life, sir.  Well, it's...  People love that removal.  It's the trade term.  A removal.  Wait, who did you remove, though? 
[00:24:30]  Was it an old person, was it...  No, it was an older person.  It was from a nursing home here in the city.  That's always great when the black car pulls up to the back of the hospital or the nursing home.  Just move them out.  Actually, I drive a Suburban.  Oh, you put them in the Suburban?  Yeah.  Nice.  Does that totally creep you out, though?  You're driving.  You know there's a dead person in the back.  No.  No.  Don't bother me anymore.  It never really did.  And I'm not a morbid person.  I'm not like that.  You pick people up at night?  Night, day. 
[00:25:00]  Sometimes I go 18 hours without stopping.  So, you're driving your Suburban.  There's a dead body in the back of the Suburban.  And do you kind of give the glance in the rear view?  Because I know I'd be crapping myself.  Let me tell you something.  All those things you hear about, people talk about bodies sitting up and all that stuff, it's a myth.  Don't buy any word of it.  But when you jam on the brakes, does it ever slide forward and knock the back of your seat?  No, no, no.  No, nothing like that.  But, Peter, even though it's a myth, I mean, your mind plays tricks on you,  especially if you're picking up a body and it's kind of a deserted neighborhood. 
[00:25:30]  It's dark out.  You start getting a little creeped out.  No, absolutely not.  All right.  All right.  So, anyway, the gentleman on the phone before, what he's describing is what's called anatomical embossess.  Anatomical embossess.  Yeah.  People that donate their bodies to science, they still have to be prepared through embossess.  And a lot of the teaching hospitals have morgue setups like that, that they hang the bodies by their ears.  Why by the ears?  Wouldn't the ears rip off under the weight of a human? 
[00:26:00]  No, no, because it screws into the bone inside the ear.  Wait a minute.  So, this is great.  So, they're not actually by the ears.  It's by the skull.  Yeah, it's the actual skull.  Oh, exactly.  So, they screw the screws into your skull and lift you up so you're hanging by your head.  I'm telling you, I've seen this somewhere.  On HBO or something, they hang the bodies.  And then what?  But, basically, what happens is the embalming fluids allow the drain out of the tissues.  Oh.  So, with respect to, like, funeral home embalming, it's not like that. 
[00:26:30]  And how is that done?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Back up, though.  How do you get the fluids out of the body?  Do you have to make cuts in the body or something?  Usually, it's the carotid artery.  It's a small incision on your collarbone, where your neck meets your collarbone.  And it pumps out.  I'm sorry?  The incision's about a half an inch wide.  It's that.  Yeah.  You know, and then what you do is you go in, you use what's called an aneurysm hook, which is a small, like a blunt instrument.  Yeah.  On one end, and you use your finger, and you raise the common carotid artery. 
[00:27:00]  And it basically looks like a piece of linguine.  You lift it up.  You take a scissor.  You make a small incision.  You take, you have a machine that's basically a pump.  And it's got a hose connected to it with a smaller tube that flies into the artery.  And that's it.  Pretty much.  Oh.  The whole thing, on most cases, you could wrap up most cases in an hour.  But how do you get it out? 
[00:27:30]  Well, basically, it's the blood that comes out.  The vein is right next to the artery.  You, same way with a scissor, you slip the vein.  Yeah.  And the blood rolls into the sink, and that's it.  Usually, don't forget, while you're injecting the fluid, you know, you're washing the hair, you're setting the features.  Washing the hair.  Well, shampoo, yeah.  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, back up.  I heard something that sounded really creepy.  You set the features.  Yeah, close the eyes, close the mouth.  And that's it. 
[00:28:00]  You do that with Vaseline and Cotton.  How do you get the fluids out of the feet and stuff?  Vaseline and Cotton?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because as you're injecting the fluid, the fluid going in is pushing the blood out.  Oh, okay, I got you.  All right.  All right.  I got you.  So why do you need the body hanging for that?  Well, I assume you need the body to hang so you let gravity take over.  Funeral home, like, you know, mom dies, you go to the funeral home.  It's not like that.  The body doesn't hang.  The body lays on a table, and that's it.  It's a stainless steel table or porcelain, and that's as far as it goes. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  In your teaching hospitals, they have to hang the body because they use a greater amount  of volume of fluid than they do in funeral home embalming, cosmetic embalming.  Yeah.  It's a whole different story.  Hey, can you do this procedure live on our show for you?  Oh, no, I can't.  I can't do that.  Jesus, damn.  I don't think the Department of Health would appreciate that.  Well, we're just educating people.  Yeah.  As far as, you know, a lot of people have a lot of misconceptions about what's done  and what's done in the funeral home, and when people come in to sit down and they make 
[00:29:00]  their funeral arrangements, they don't understand all the legalities and the paperwork and everything  that you have to explain to them, and it becomes a two, three-hour process, you know?  Really?  Everybody thinks you just die, and that's it, you know?  It's not like that.  Even a simple funeral, you still have to come in, you still have to sit down with the funeral  director, you still have to make the arrangements.  No, but that's how it is.  A lot of people don't really understand what goes on, and I hear, like, some wicked stories.  Like, everybody has a friend who works in a morgue, who's worked in a funeral home, 
[00:29:30]  the body's set up and all this stuff.  Guys, I've done over 500 cases in a couple of years I've been doing this work, which isn't  that much.  I've never had a body set up.  I've never had any problems.  I've fallen asleep in the office with two calls laid out and never had a problem.  Fall asleep?  Boy, that's hardcore.  Or, you listen, sometimes it happens, you know?  You're up all night.  Yeah.  You know?  And you go nonstop, and that's how it works.  Let me tell you something.  People never die.  I'd walk in and move one of them while you were sleeping. 
[00:30:00]  Listen.  I would move it right in front of your feet, like sitting there, and prop the hands up  on your knees.  So when you wake up, it's just staring at you.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  People never die nine to five.  They always die when you're out with your girlfriend.  You're sitting down to dinner, 2.30 in the morning, and it's snowing.  It never comes during the day.  That's romantic.  You don't want to tell your chick.  I've got to go pick up a stiff.  Yeah.  I lost the relationship over that because she couldn't handle that.  All right, bro. 
[00:30:30]  Go figure.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  You know, listen.  The choice between making money, you know, it's kind of a fine line between getting laid  or making money.  I think I'll take the dose sometimes.  Hey, Peter, before we let you go, Vinny from Rosedale writes, can this guy drive in the  HOV lane on the LIE?  Hey, yeah.  He's got a point, but no.  No.  Wait, what cop is going to give you a ticket for trying?  There he is in the back.  There he is right there.  I got two.  That's the guy.  Very good, though.  Chief, would you do that?  Let's ask.  Hold on.  Yeah, we have a cop in the studio. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, ask him.  I tell you, absolutely not.  If I came up and I said, listen, guy, you know, it's two people in the lane, and he said,  listen, the dead guy's in the back, and I walk back there, and there's a dead guy, you get  a free ride, man.  I don't think there's a cop in the tri-state area that's giving you that ticket.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, Peter.  All right.  Thank you.  Back to you, Rusty.  I'm going to go listen to myself on the radio.  All right, cool.  Unless it was Joel Riskin.  Yeah, right.  Of course, when they caught him with the body in the back, he got a little worse than an  HOV ticket.  There you have it.  Anthony from the ONA Archives.  Yes.  This reminded me of the Green Bay Funeral Home. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, this is, uh, this is a classic.  Hello?  Yes, ma'am.  Okay, uh, my name's Artie Milo, and, uh, my father had recently passed away.  Did you, did your dad pass away, did you say?  Yes, yes, he did.  When was that?  I don't know, two, three days ago.  Okay.  Now, he wanted to, uh, watch the Super Bowl with his family.  Uh-huh.  And we just want to know if there's a way you can come over and, like, you know, temporarily, 
[00:32:00]  you know, prop him up, uh, in, in the big chair, so when the family comes over, he'll  be okay until after the Super Bowl, and then we'll bury him?  No, we can't do that, Mr. Milo.  Oh, it was his one dream to watch the Packers in, in the Super Bowl, and we already painted  his face green and gold.  No, I, but it, it would, you mean, not get him until then?  Yeah, well, you could come over and maybe, you know, pump him with whatever you do, and,  uh, you know, preserve him until after the bowl.  Well, I'm afraid we just can't do it. 
[00:32:30]  Why?  It was his dream, you know, to watch the, the, the Packers in the bowl.  Uh-huh.  And we've been holding on to him for a couple of days now.  He's been in the barn, but, you know, the coyotes have been a-nipping, and I don't think  he's going to make it until Sunday.  Uh-huh.  Now, he died, who knows that he has died?  Hopefully, uh, no one.  Um, but if, we just want you to come over and, you know, prop him up in the chair and  maybe open up his hand, and, so we could put a beer in there.  And we can't, we can't do that.  We can't embalm anybody.  Embalm, that's the word.  And once they're embalmed, they can't be, you know, they can't be in a sitting position. 
[00:33:00]  You know, it's just kind of...  Well, he's been in a sitting position now, and he's getting kind of hard.  But if you could maybe do something and then lay him down later?  No, I'm afraid we can't.  We'd even be up to, you know, if you've got to break something, it's okay.  No, we don't do that.  It was his one lifetime dream to see the pack in the board with his family, and we got the  big screen TV and the chair for him, and he went up and died.  We, we, we will not do that.  Oh.  If, if your dad has died, and if you really have not notified anybody, you do have to 
[00:33:30]  do that.  So you have to have the medical examiner's approval to take him away.  Okay, look.  What if we put the, uh, coffin in the house and put the TV on the coffin?  That way he'll be with the family.  Is there a law or something?  No, if, if he was embalmed, and if he was, you know, able, you know, like, if there was,  if there's no problem as far as preserving him.  Right.  And could you put, like, a pack, a banner in his hand?  Because it was his dream to see the packs in the, in the bowl.  We could probably do that.  You could put a pack, or that's okay? 
[00:34:00]  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if we could have a visitation, you know, in the house, depending on how, you  know, how well he preserved he was, and if we could get a casket into the house.  But once he's, you know, once he's embalmed, he is laying down.  Right.  Okay.  Do you think that's, like, degrading if we put the cheesehead hat on him?  Do you want me to call the medical examiner for you?  Oh, no, that might not be a good idea.  Then we'd have to try to explain where his feet went.  Bye.  Bye.  One of the best lines ever.  Bye.  Explain where his feet went.  You're just amazed they hang on so long, so you've got to just nail them at the end with 
[00:34:30]  something that you know they're going to hang up with.  Finally.  Sometimes they don't.  Yeah.  212-757-1027.  You're kidding.  God love them.  God love them.  Sal, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  I go to school, actually.  It's about 10 blocks away from you guys to become a funeral director.  Oh, yeah?  They got to school where they send dead people over there?  No, we don't do that.  We go down to Bellevue Morgue, actually.  Hey, Sal, when did you decide you wanted to do this for a living?  One of my friends passed away, actually, and pretty much kissed his head.  He felt like cold wood and wanted to see what the heck went on during the process. 
[00:35:00]  Are you kidding me?  I'm serious.  You kissed your friend's wood once?  I kissed his head.  Oh, you kissed a head?  Yeah.  Close friend.  The gentleman that was just on, did he tell you guys about a trocar?  You're a good friend.  About a what?  The trocar.  What's that?  It's about a two-foot-long needle that they actually make.  That's what I was talking about.  Yeah, that's what they do.  They stick that right into your chest, and that's where they pull everything out.  Yeah, that big stainless steel-like tube, and they shove it in you and suck out all your fluids. 
[00:35:30]  Yep, that's what they do.  And the case where you guys had about holding the bodies up, you could do that in cases of severe edema.  That's why you would hang them up, to drain it out.  All right, you go back to school.  You're making me sick.  Yeah, I will, my friend.  I'll deliver you guys something, all right?  Thanks, Sal.  Yeah, I've got to go listen to myself on the radio, tough guy.  Listen to this, tool.  Let's move on.  Ray, what's going on?  Thanks, guys.  I just ate, man. 
[00:36:00]  I know.  We're going to move on.  You got a hazing story?  Yeah.  Okay.  I went to aviation high school, and we used to take the freshman kids, send them down to the propeller shop.  We used to, like, overhaul propellers, send them for buckets of prop wash.  Prop wash?  Prop wash, yeah.  Obviously, there's no such thing.  Oh, obviously.  It's just the term, like, you know, the wind blowing back at you.  Airplane high school?  What the hell is it?  It's in Long Island City.  Aviation high?  Yep.  And then we used to do the same thing at the airport.  You have to send the guys for jet wash, the new guys. 
[00:36:30]  Send them all around the airport.  Go to American Airlines.  Go to the maintenance shop.  Ask them for, we need some jet wash.  Morning announcements.  Welcome.  Aviation high.  We'll be studying at an altitude of about, how tall are you?  About five feet, ten inches.  Close enough.  Uh, thank you for flying.  Maybe you should not.  I've never heard of that.  Never heard of what?  The school?  Yeah.  I've heard of the, like, if you get out of high school and you want to go into it.  No, man.  This school's been around since, like, the 20s. 
[00:37:00]  I think it would have went there.  I would have went somewhere like that.  I could go John Glenn High School and I don't graduate because of stupid gym.  They got gym class there?  Of course they got gym.  They got the dykeiest gym teachers, too, man.  What the hell does gym have to do with flying?  With flying.  But it has nothing to do with flying.  It's fixing them.  We had our own hangar.  Oh, is that what you do?  Just fixing them high school?  Yeah, maintenance.  It has nothing to do with the flying them high school?  No, no.  They didn't teach you how to fix them.  We had airplanes in the hangar.  We had an actual hangar on Queens Boulevard.  Interesting.  There's a hangar. 
[00:37:30]  Airplanes, helicopters.  Learn something new every day, Opie.  Yeah.  A hangar.  Tons of fun, man.  A hangar.  All right, Ray.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  That's like the commercials, though, for the Air Force.  When you watch the commercials, you're like, God damn, this looks great.  I remember watching them when I was a kid going, this looks great.  I want to join.  I want to fly that thing.  But then you realize when you get in, all you're going to be doing is fixing them, maybe  fueling them, and sometimes not even near them.  Fixing the tire, washing them, whatever.  You don't get to fly them.  You don't get to fly those cool planes.  You're just fixing them. 
[00:38:00]  Jason.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, when I first joined the Marines, man, what they used to do is, like, you check  into your unit the first day, and while you were sleeping, like, for a bunch of, like,  the older guys would come in, and they'd tape you between two mattresses and throw you  off the second deck.  Yeah, I can handle the pressure, man.  Oh, my God.  Did anyone ever get hurt?  No, not really, because you'd, like, bounce around, and you'd hear the guy going, ah!  You know?  That's right.  And, like, everybody would be laughing at him, and then, you know.  Then they came up with, like, punching jump wings in your chest and all that other cool  stuff, too. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, you like that stuff, right?  Yeah, you know, we've got to do something, you know?  All right, buddy.  All right, Larry.  Thank you.  Military.  My God.  Buckshot.  Yeah, how you doing?  O&A.  Good.  Anthony.  Hey.  I worked on it, you know, doing those track works, doing the old tin knocking.  Ah, sure.  And we hired this guy who's about 30 years old, total alcoholic.  Sounds like tin knocking.  Got a drink to your drink.  Sitting on a bottle, sitting on a stack of buckets, and we're working one day, and 
[00:39:00]  we send this guy, we go, you've got to go get a bucket of steam.  And he actually went.  That old gag.  And he went, and he asked, these Portuguese guys pouring cement for a bucket of steam.  Portuguese pouring cement, though, but you never see them.  I'm a stereotype.  It's not true.  He asked all these guys for a bucket of steam.  Finally, I felt so bad, I retrieved the guy.  And I got him back.  I go, what the hell are you doing?  He goes, I'm looking for a bucket of steam. 
[00:39:30]  I said, you can't get a bucket of steam.  That's a good hazing story.  I told him.  But the guy with the propeller wash, I heard that because I work with a guy who, he used  to be in the Navy.  And he used to send guys for a propeller wash.  Propeller wash, all propeller wash is, is the air behind the propeller.  Right.  When it starts to take off.  Right.  So that guy was right.  All right, Buckshot, thank you.  I'm still in the...  He's still talking.  We like the bucket of steam.  Thank you.  Dogging, dogging, dogging. 
[00:40:00]  Act, act, act, act, act, act, act.  I'll be a job site.  Job site hazings are always fun.  I remember that.  You get a newbie on the job and you make them open up the closed spackle bucket in  the basement and you know what's in there.  Because everyone uses the spackle bucket as toilets on the job site.  So there'll be a big dump in there.  Usually a guy doesn't have toilet paper, so he's using like his job apron or something  or just anything laying around the house.  The worst is, some of these animals would crap right in the brand new bathtubs that were 
[00:40:30]  just installed.  So let me tell you something.  The sick stuff that goes on in your houses that you're having built before you move in,  you'd never take a bath.  Guys taking craps, leaking all over the corner of your kitchen, it was peed in.  They just do it.  I swear to God, they just do that.  So what happens after you crap in the bathtub?  Someone's got to clean it up.  They get laborers.  That's what laborers are for.  They go and clean all that stuff up.  But the sealed spackle bucket, he would go, hey, you want to open that bucket over there?  And the guy's like trying to pry it open, open it up.  And there's just some frigging carpenter's big dump that's been just aging in there for 
[00:41:00]  a little while.  Or you duct tape the portable toilet shut when some guy's in there.  We had this guy that we used to just torture on a daily basis.  He was a little fidget guy.  I swear he was like four feet tall.  And every day he got abused on the job site.  And he'd go into the portable toilet and we'd duct tape the door shut.  And there's no way you're getting out.  And then we'd start rocking it back and forth and then leaning it over just to the point 
[00:41:30]  where it's going to fall and then bringing it back.  And you just hear all the crap go from one side to the other.  We taped him from just his ankles onto this big beam.  And he was taped just by the ankle.  So he's bobbing back and forth trying to stay up.  And we were just throwing nails at him.  Really bad.  But that happens all the time on job site.  It gets you through the day.  Really bad.  Let's finish with Carlos and then we'll take a break here.  Carlos, what's going on? 
[00:42:00]  I got a friend in Long Island.  She has a funeral home.  Yeah.  And they washed people down with a Brillo.  They washed the dead bodies with Brillo?  With a Brillo.  I could not believe that.  And she was dead serious.  Why Brillo?  I have no idea.  After the embalming, they washed them down with Brillo.  And then they dress them up.  I guess they're not going to feel it.  It kind of washes them pretty clean.  It's a closed cover.  That was incredible.  I know in Columbia Presbyterian in New York City, they have a...  Why wash them down, though? 
[00:42:30]  Just make their face look good, do their hair, and let's move on.  I don't know.  They washed their whole body.  I have no idea.  All right, Carlos.  How do we get into these discussions?  Yeah, this is starting to creep me out.  It is a Friday.  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Take it easy.  Let's talk about the ass contest.  We will talk about the ass contest next.  Bill Dwyer's coming in here from BattleBots, Anthony.  Oh, I got confused.  I thought Bud Dwyer was coming.  No, no.  Bill Dwyer.  That would be interesting, though.  See, Bud Dwyer.  A relations?  Is he relating?  I hope not.  This is my dad.  You bastards.  We love BattleBots.  He's coming in around 4.15. 
[00:43:00]  We'll talk about the ass contest next.  Yeah.  Right now, let's go to the F.U. line.  This is the Opian Anthony F.U. Friday line.  Yeah, I got a big F.U. from an ex-white designer, a freaking lesbian lover, Elizabeth.  All right, F.U. is right in your ass.  Okay.  You and my kids are pawns.  You people are worthless pieces of crap.  And Elizabeth, you dyke piece of crap.  You want to impress somebody?  Impregnate somebody with a freaking tongue of yours so you can use your own kids' freaking  pawns.  F.U. is right in your ass. 
[00:43:30]  F.U. have a good freaking day.  Next message.  Hi, Alex.  I'm S.U.S.  Tomas Arish, Metallica.  F.U.  Weedy bastard ruined Napster.  F.U.  You, you dirty little faggot.  I hope you get raped in prison one time.  Next message.  I want to send a big F.U. to Elisa, the fat sex, the size of her gut that hangs over her  jeans, because she won't give me back my gas, please, because she's too poor to have  her own.  F.U.  Three nasty facts, Brian and Hal. 
[00:44:00]  End of message.  O.P. and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't take to.  This is a problem.  Stop.  12-7-W-N-W.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  My brothers are supposed to call in today, Anthony, to help me out with that story from  yesterday.  Oh, your horror story? 
[00:44:30]  The family vacation when I was 11.  We figured out I was 11.  Did you bring nice cement bags full of sugar and margarine sandwiches, Opie?  We had to pack our little clothes and cement bags up.  Quickly, Joe One Lake from Jersey checking in.  He says, I joined the Marine Corps because I got tired of pumping gas.  I told him I wanted to fly jets, so I took the test.  They promised the air wing.  I got the air wing.  Pumping gas into jets.  No. 
[00:45:00]  Son of a...  That's funny.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Can I tell the story again really fast?  Yes.  Basically, yeah, I was from a big family.  Didn't have a lot of money to go around, so when Dad said he's going to load up the truck  or the, actually, the Volkswagen bus.  Volkswagen bus?  We had a Volkswagen bus.  Oh, God.  And they took the seats out so they could fit more kids in there.  The family truckster.  It was the family truckster. 
[00:45:30]  Dude, the Volkswagen bus.  Yeah.  If you had that...  It was a death machine.  I know.  It was like, no, any time on the road you pass that, it was never anyone normal-looking  driving them.  They were all hippies.  Like, anyone you looked at driving a Volkswagen bus was either a hippie or some computer  complete deranged serial killer-looking guy.  Well, they didn't have the SUVs and the minivans, so, yeah, if you saw one of those on the highway,  it was two things.  A family with a lot of kids, like my family, or someone going to a dead show.  The thing is, the family with a lot of kids usually had the station wagon. 
[00:46:00]  And the Volkswagen minibus was reserved for real, like, lunatics and hippies.  Well, you've met my family.  Okay.  Draw your own conclusion.  Well, they ain't hippies.  My friend.  No, thanks.  Yeah, well, I have seven kids.  You can't fit seven kids in the Volkswagen.  You can get them in the station wagon.  I'm in the station wagon.  Sure you can.  Not really.  Oh, yeah.  You put the youngest one in that seat that faces backwards so they can pick their nose  and wave to the people.  And someone on the hump. 
[00:46:30]  So, the story goes, my brother Elmo's already checking in the guy who designed the now-famous  Wild Bumper sticker, by the way.  Yes.  He's a bitter man, so this is going to get a little ugly.  But basically, yeah, Dad said that, here, I'll get him involved with this story.  Hopefully, Brett will call in, too.  Elmo.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I was telling this story yesterday, and you weren't listening, obviously.  Yeah, well, I was, my psychiatrist told me not to call in.  I was cringing in the corner.  Opie, Ernio wants to know if you guys called it the buski.  The buski. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, cute.  I'm never going to live that one down.  I'm out as long as we remember.  So, Elm, you remember, right?  We were all little kids.  Well, first, like you said, the seven kids, but then we also had Karen, whoever she was.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A chick who lived with us.  That's right.  I forgot about it.  A chick that lived with you?  Yeah.  Yeah, like she got kicked out of her family, so we, like, kind of, I don't know, we adopted  her for two or three years.  How old was she?  She was, like, hot.  She was hot.  I'm out.  She was like, I never heard about this.  I forgot.  She was, like, she was, yeah, she was in high school, and she used to walk around the house 
[00:47:30]  with no bras on and stuff.  It was really hot.  I forgot about her.  Because there were five boys.  But she's cousin Oliver of the Hughes house.  But she kind of looked like us.  They kind of looked like us, and she looked like us, and they kind of tried to pass her  off like she was a real sister.  What is this, little house on the prairie?  Aren't there records of who owns who?  All of a sudden, like, she showed up, and they tried to pass her off like, yeah, she's  a long-lost sister.  I forgot about that.  She was a little runaway causing havoc, a little ragamuffin in Mankato. 
[00:48:00]  So we brought her back to Walnut Grove.  She was our version of Oliver, actually.  Yeah.  And then, like, she had it with my parents, and she left one day, and that was it.  But she was a member of our family for two or three years.  I forgot about that.  She made us all look at each other and wonder, like, are we all natural children, or are  we going to take you out of the mall?  We cared about her so much, we even put her in the cement outside our house.  Yeah, she was in the cement.  Dude, I've got to ask you, though.  How old were you guys during this time?  We were like 10, 11.  Did you have some kind of crush on this chick? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  She was hot.  Wow.  You didn't hear me.  She used to try to make a move or something?  She used to walk around the house with no bras on, little hippie clothes and stuff,  and we were...  We'll tell the cement story another day, Elms, because we don't want to...  kissing contest or something?  No, I don't know.  No.  What are you doing?  You didn't want any piece of us.  No.  Are you kidding?  She was banging...  There's five of us.  Who are you going to choose?  She was banging guys in our attic, though.  Another story for another day, but, yeah, so we had to do a lot of cement work around  our house. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  And she made the masons that you are.  The work you guys have.  Wait a minute.  Elms.  It wasn't a house.  It was a barrow.  You're either plowing the fields with your bicycles or doing cement work.  All right.  Here.  Hey, they had to empty the cement out of the bag so they could take them to school for lunch.  Yeah, for lunch.  Someone call my brother, Brett, because he's probably trying to call in.  You guys have the best upbringing.  All right.  You know what it is?  It sounds like the typical American family just off-kilter just a bit. 
[00:49:30]  You know, because you're all together.  You're going on vacation.  You're doing these family things.  But it's just somehow not quite right.  It always took a wicked right turn somewhere.  So, Elmo, tell Anthony about the cement.  Brett has the best stories about the cement.  We cemented everything around our house.  Everything.  And we're convinced it was just to keep us busy and keep us out of our mom's hair.  Just do things. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our dad would just see as something I've never heard of until him, a cement fetish, I guess.  We had cement paths going everywhere.  Everywhere.  We cemented so many paths in our backyard.  We finally asked our dad, why don't you just cement the whole yard over and paint it green?  Right.  Because that's what it was like.  He was into cementing and rock walls.  Rock walls, yeah.  Where we would have to take the Volkswagen bus to, like, basically other people's property and steal their rocks. 
[00:50:30]  Wait, you would take rocks and just stack them up?  And we had to, you know, go on a scavenger hunt and get, like, rocks from the woods.  My dad would pull up.  I'm not kidding.  Back then, you know, the Centerport area and stuff, it's not as built up as it is now.  He would just pull up to a hill and go, all right, kids, and we'd have to go running out and find rocks.  And get rocks.  The perfect size.  Poor little bastards, man.  The perfect size rocks for, you know, rock walls.  And if we were on someone's property, my dad would just say, oh, these crazy kids, you know, I can't control them. 
[00:51:00]  They'd just go out stealing rocks.  We had a sand pit to get our sand to make our cement right in the backyard.  So you would mix it all up.  Yeah.  Mix the cement.  And we were eight or nine mixing cement from scratch.  That's wrong.  All day long.  All day long.  I'm not kidding.  As Brett says, we didn't go to bed, we went up to the barracks.  Yeah.  And it was like barracks because we had, like, there was a time we had five boys in one room, two bunk beds. 
[00:51:30]  As the chick is having sex in the attic.  Right.  Yeah.  God damn, this is twisted.  Well, you know what?  That's my other sister.  One of her boyfriends was living in our attic, and we didn't know for a really long time.  Right, Elms?  That's right.  Come on.  Tell me I'm lying.  I know it.  But the guy, like, he was, you know, in Harborfield's terms, a greaser.  Right. 
[00:52:00]  He smoked some of that pot, had the leather jacket, the whole deal.  Sure.  When you talk about greasers, he was, like, the greaser.  And he got kicked out of his house, and he was dating my sister.  And my sister got the bright idea that he could live in the attic.  Live in the attic.  And no one would hear him banging around up there.  Speak clearly.  No, we're not.  This is no joke.  We used to hear noises from the attic.  And it would scare us, because we were just little kids still, 10, 11, 12.  Like, did you hear that?  Yeah, man.  There's something up in the attic.  And we would tell our parents. 
[00:52:30]  And they're like, you're out of your effing minds.  There's nothing in the attic, you know?  Well, Dad would say, yeah, there's something up there.  And it'll get you if you don't do your cement work.  Right.  So how did we discover that he was living up there?  Because my sister would bring him food and stuff.  I think it was that one night where we woke up with my mom screaming hysterically.  What are you doing?  I believe that's how it started.  But, hey, I could be wrong. 
[00:53:00]  So, yeah.  A little fun history fact.  Yeah.  Rock walls were built by field hands in the winter to keep farm hands from leaving and going to find other work in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Hey, thanks, man.  Great.  But you might want to know why you were doing it.  So, I don't know.  He made a lot of noise one day.  My mom discovered it.  And he was kicked out of our attic.  So, all right.  Getting back to the family vacation.  Sick.  So, Dad, like, you know, Summer was coming.  And he was telling us about this great family vacation we were going to take upstate New York.  Do you remember what town? 
[00:53:30]  No.  It was, like, way up in the Caskills.  I walked it out.  Yeah, it was way up there.  It was way up there, Anthony.  So, he's telling us, you know, we're going to be way up in the mountains.  This, you know, Terry's uncle.  You know, he's got this property with a house and all these shacks that he rents out.  And there's a stream.  All your dreams will come true, kids.  They made it sound like it was incredible.  Paradise.  We were going to be there for a week.  And all you kids will have your own cabin.  And there's a pool. 
[00:54:00]  Sounds great.  You can run around the woods to your heart's content and burn them down.  Fish in the stream and stuff.  Right.  So, it had to be, what, an 8 to 10, maybe 12-hour trip.  Yeah, it took days to get there.  Yeah, when you're taking seven kids, you stop a lot, you know.  Somewhere along the way, we discovered, I told a lot of this yesterday, but my brother's going to help me out with some details I forgot.  So, somewhere along the way, we discovered that the reason we were going to see my sister's uncle was because she inherited his property because he recently died. 
[00:54:30]  And that kind of came to light in the back of the van there.  Yeah, and when you were all huddled around and Terry finally whispered to us.  Yeah.  When you're 10 and 11 and you hear, like, anything to do with death, you just freak out.  Without a doubt.  You don't understand it at all.  So, we finally pull up to this place.  Basically, my sister was in her in the property.  They wanted to see what it was all about and, you know, see what they could do with it. 
[00:55:00]  We pull up to the place.  Alms, you want to take it from there?  This was supposed to be our family summer vacation in paradise in the middle of the mountains.  Our paradise.  Our Hawaii in New York.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is like the Brady Bunch.  They go into Hawaii.  Right.  Instead, we get out.  There's a rusted, crippled fence around what I assume was a pool, but you don't know what it was.  Just bobbing beer cans everywhere.  The second we exited the vehicle in a timely manner, we were swarmed by insects the size of bats. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, I forgot about that.  It was mosquitoes.  Like, you wouldn't believe.  Just swarming.  Going for my little brothers the most because, I guess, they're young skin or something.  So, they were, like, taken down.  Hey, was this the same trip where Brett saved his twin brother?  Well, I thought that was Scott who did that.  Oh, Scott saved Quinn.  Scott saved Quinn.  Yeah.  From the river.  From Rolling Rapids. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, it was just a stop on the way to, you know, to, like, do the laundry and the stream and all that.  You know some of that drive-by nature you could do, pull over and check out the nice stream or something?  All right, we're all going to get out and check out this stream.  It was Rolling Rapids, and, you know, my parents thought it would be cool to kind of just have lunch on the rocks in the middle of this Rolling Rapids.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  And my four-year-old, my four-year-old brother at the time, he now works on Wall Street.  Fell in?  Oh, yeah, fell in. 
[00:56:30]  And he was gone, man.  Wait a minute.  Left the way.  Left the way.  He was gone, and at the last second, my brother, who was downstream, jumped in.  He couldn't have been more than nine, jumped in, and he hadn't saved his life.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, Scott grabbed him.  There's a waterfall close by.  Now, wait a minute.  They took you out on the rocks in the river?  Or you were, like, on the side of the river?  I don't know.  We were kids, so I guess...  It was on the side, but the water, you know...  Put it this way.  Yeah, the slippery rocks that lead right into it. 
[00:57:00]  There's seven kids and Karen.  And it's time to eat your peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, so you open up the Volkswagen  bus, and it's like, all right, kids, we'll see you back here in a half hour.  Now, wouldn't your parents kind of, you're close to a river, maybe keep tabs on the young'uns  so they don't do such things?  And it's just like, you know, you're driving along and you see that duck, the mother duck  and all the little ducks trying to cross the street.  It's pretty tough to keep an eye on everybody.  Keep them together.  Plus, we were waiting for Karen to get all wet. 
[00:57:30]  Sure, sure.  So, all I remember was, I was kind of in the, I don't know where I was, but I remember  the screams like, oh my God, my mom's losing it.  Their twin is taking off down the rolling rapid.  And my mom's like, oh, the river's got another one.  And my brother jumped in and saved them, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that makes for a fun ride the rest of the day.  Oh, my God, you almost died.  Yeah, I know, man.  Near death.  You have a wet, scared to death, four-year-old kid going to see a dead guy's house. 
[00:58:00]  That's a dream vacation.  So, yeah, back to the dead guy's house.  So then, yeah, we discovered that the guy recently died, and we were, you know, checking  out the property to figure out what we were going to do with it.  He already described the pool.  The grass wasn't cut for probably over a year because it was, what, four feet high?  Yeah, you lost yourself.  Now, what, did this guy that died own this hotel thing or own the whole thing?  No joke.  You owned a house with, like, ten outhouses in the woods.  Yeah.  He rented out.  Ten little shacks that were kind of in the woods. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  I've seen those places.  Yeah, I've seen them.  You drive by there and go, who the F would ever, ever stay there?  Right.  And they don't clean them out often and stuff.  So, and then we discover the way the guy died.  Well, he was smoking in bed, and he burned himself up in half the house.  So then I went inside.  Why'd you go in?  I made the cut because I guess I was just a little older because Darren's only, what,  you're two years younger than me, and you didn't go in?  Yeah.  Yeah, because we're all trying to go in just to avoid the mosquitoes taking us away into 
[00:59:00]  the woods.  Yeah, and my dad's like, oh, yeah, you don't want to go in there.  And what I saw was horrific.  I mean, we walked into where he died, and it was like just charred remains.  I mean, you saw where the bed was, and it was just burn marks everywhere.  The wall was gone because of this fire that took him and the room away.  Dude, these are all Little House on the Prairie stories.  I got it.  You guys aren't making this up?  Every one of these stories has been in an episode of Little House on the Prairie. 
[00:59:30]  Then there's a guy, the caretaker of the place, who looks at us.  He's like, we don't get many people in these parks since they built that new superhighway.  We're like, what is going on?  And Oak was our big brother who we look up to.  Oh, yeah.  He comes out of the house, and we just see the look, and it's safe.  We're like, oh, my God.  Horror.  Now we're scared to death.  We're scared to death, and we're like, we're supposed to stay here a week, a week, not a day.  It wasn't like we had to do this.  It was a hassle, and we're moving on to bigger and better things. 
[01:00:00]  No, this is our family vacation.  So then my dad, who just nothing phases my path, nothing in the world.  He's like, okay, so, you know, everyone pick a cabin.  We are just scared, esteless.  It turns out like six of us stayed in one cabin because we weren't, you know, separating for anything.  Strength in numbers.  And then what, the cabins had, like, big spiderwebs and mosquitoes, and the bed wasn't changed, and who knows how long.  Let old seas.  There was a straw in the corner, and it was like a horror movie where you're yelling at the screen when some guy says, oh, I'm going to go get a Coke. 
[01:00:30]  And you're like, no, he's going to die.  We're all huddled in there, and somebody's hungry.  It's like, fight the hunger.  Fight the hunger.  Don't go out until daylight.  Remember we had our little baseball mitts.  We're like, all right, we'll just have a little catch.  You know, get our mind off what's going on around us.  And we, like, threw it, like, twice and then had to run back in the cabin.  We were scared.  Was there any TV or anything?  No.  Oh, no.  Nothing.  TV.  Running water would have been a luxury.  So at this point, my mom is just losing it, just screaming at Freddy. 
[01:01:00]  Freddy, get us out of here.  My dad's taking the burnt sheets from the bed saying, hey, we can brush these off, and they're fine.  You know, I was exaggerating a little bit, but my dad, like I said, nothing fazes him.  He would almost do that.  So then my mom, you know, got us out, what, first thing in the morning?  I mean, daylight was coming up, and he was like, pack the car.  We are out of here.  Dawn.  And we drove into town to get, I don't know, a town that was kind of like a ghost town-ish thing.  Really small town in the middle of nowhere. 
[01:01:30]  We get, like, kind of a bed and breakfast place.  And my dad's like, hey, why don't we go to a movie to, you know, get our minds off what happened.  Because my mom's just freaking at this point.  The only movie playing in town at this theater that shows one movie was One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Nice R-rated movie for the seven kids.  And, and, Karen.  So you all drove, you went to a drive-in?  No, we obviously couldn't go see One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. 
[01:02:00]  So then we were just stuck.  Yeah, the people like, oh, you're the ones who were inheriting the old Hopkins.  Yeah.  You better watch out.  Some say he didn't start that fire.  Yeah, that's.  With the micro bus, you guys like Scooby effing do.  Oh, it's awesome.  With the mystery machine.  So I wish Brett called in because he had a few more details, but.  Actually, Brett is here.  He's there?  One last thing about the, uh, the bus, too. 
[01:02:30]  Remember, Dad turned the seats around until we faced each other.  Yeah.  So that's what you want.  As an adult, you want to be driving for two straight days while eight kids are facing each other, screaming and yelling and fighting.  All right.  Does Brett have anything to add to this or no?  He's trying to call in, I believe.  I want to know more about this mysterious Karen chick.  Where is she now?  We don't know.  I don't know.  One day she was gone.  She's living with you for how long?  Really?  A couple of years at least.  A couple of years and now you just don't know where she is?  This girl is like an older sister to you for two years and you have no clue what happened to her? 
[01:03:00]  Wait, Elmo.  Yeah.  I can't believe you.  Hold on.  Wait.  How can we get Brett on the air?  Because he's trying to call the same number you're on, I think.  Where are you guys?  I'm on my phone.  He's on the other phone.  He should be able to call, no problem.  The other phone.  Hold up.  They want you to.  Huh?  He's in my housemate's room.  Oh.  He's gone.  He's dying.  Let's see if he can work the phone.  We've got to give him another number, I think.  It's too traumatic. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  We'll figure it out in a second.  I'll give him the studio number.  Give him the other line that you didn't use.  Okay.  So what happened to the girl?  Yeah.  She lived with us for like two or three years and then she couldn't take my mom anymore.  Yeah.  And one day she was just crying in the kitchen as like her boyfriend was loading up a pickup  truck and said, I'm leaving.  And at this point we consider her assistant.  Yeah.  You kind of get after three years, I would think. 
[01:04:00]  And we hugged her and we figured out, well, we'll meet her at Friendly's, you know, in one  of these days.  One of these days.  Never seen her again.  That was it.  She's gone.  Wouldn't it be interesting to find her?  I hear she's like in the area and has kids and stuff.  Wow.  So that's something.  But she was like a warden's daughter.  When we're out in the fields and doing the cement and she'd bring out lemonade and we're  like, thank you, boss.  The warden's.  Wipe it off, boss.  We'd be staring at her, you know, wiping our brows. 
[01:04:30]  Wipe it off, boss.  Nice day, boss.  Water, boss.  That's funny.  Bath and break, boss.  Bath and break, boss.  Was she wearing Daisy Dukes?  No.  She'd be there in a nice, like, yellow flower summery dress.  Pour that cement, convict.  Plow them fields.  The good thing about the cement in the backyard was eventually it took over all the fields.  So we didn't have to work in the fields anymore.  Just cement.  Work in the fields.  This is children growing up.  We planted stuff in our backyard. 
[01:05:00]  We had a mini farm, man.  Yeah.  That's a story for another day.  Hey, we're still trying to get bread.  I think he's having trouble dialing the phone.  I knew.  It's very traumatic.  I like new families like this.  But I never, like, had the in-depth stories like this.  But there were always these families that had a lot of kids and then just drifters that  would come in for some reason and just stay there and then leave.  And, hey, man, we have a ton of them that came and went.  And they'd all, like, because there were a lot of families like this, especially on Long 
[01:05:30]  Island.  Right.  I was friends with a few people that were in families like this.  And then they'd be, like, the guy that they just pick up.  Oh, he had problems with his family and drugs.  So we brought him in.  Oh, yeah, there's a keeper.  We were always bringing people in.  Yeah.  One day they'd just stay.  I'm like, all right, I guess accept it.  Don't ask.  Hold on.  Let me put Rob on.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up, Rob?  I got to let Anthony know all these stories are true, especially bringing in the new people  because, you know, Quinn and Brent would come home from school or something. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, you want to come over and have some dinner?  Sure.  And you sit down for dinner.  And there's a guy that's, you know, right in a room upstairs who could be, like, a serial  killer sitting next to you.  And you're, like, trying to eat dinner and keep an eye on him at the same time.  Shut up.  Unbelievable.  You know, he tells the truth.  I know who this is.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, man.  What's up, man?  All right, buddy.  Check out, man.  Have a good time.  All right, cool.  Just some guy sitting there.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, we needed the extra money.  They were running rooms, man.  I'm on the lam. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, Brett.  Yeah.  Here's my other brother.  Brett, what's up, man?  You guys got me shaking.  What memories, huh?  I'm in the corner crying.  We told the story, right?  That's about it.  Yeah, but don't talk about my twin brother falling into the river.  Remember that?  Yeah, who do you think pushed him?  How'd you like growing up with the twin all your life?  I want that boy gone.  Brett, were you with him when he fell in?  Yeah.  See, I never saw that, but I remember he was gone, and Scott jumped in and grabbed him. 
[01:07:00]  I can see a poor little kid leaning over the rock, leaning, leaning, just wants to touch  the water.  Oh, there he goes.  He's leaning over the rocks with his little cup because we had no water in the car.  After the 20-hour drive.  He wanted to drink some water?  My dad thought it would be brilliant that we get some fresh spring water from the mountains.  So we all did a little chain thing from over the rocks.  Each one held on to a hand, and my twin brother was in the lead.  I was right behind him.  I said, you know what?  My birthday's coming up. 
[01:07:30]  We're always splitting gifts and whatnot, so boop, there he goes.  Do you guys have to split gifts because you have the same birthday?  Oh, my God.  Everything.  You got to share the same clothes.  Everything.  That's got some great stories, man.  Hand me down some eight kids.  Holy crow.  Let's not forget the time that, Quinn, you know what, in your mouth.  What?  What?  What?  You want to go toe-for-toe with stories?  No, I don't, man. 
[01:08:00]  Well, now you've got to tell that one.  It's another bathtub incident.  Yeah, see, we had, like, we had, Brett.  Yeah.  You've got to tell the bathtub story.  Oh, is this the bathtub water story?  No, this is the truth.  This is horrible.  This is the truth, because one of seven, you know, we didn't have much hot water.  So, what, I got to take a nice hot bath, and then you guys, one by one, would go in the water after me.  They never, they didn't drain the water. 
[01:08:30]  Like, Opie would take a bath, and then the brothers had to all get in.  Anthony, the family dog, our colleague, would go before us.  That's how high on the rent he was.  But you were bathing in used bath water.  Well, I thought.  They used to paint it to keep it warm.  Oh, no, no.  They used to go in there with, like, a little strain that's trying to pick out their hair.  So, the last two in were the twins, man.  Oh, bathing in gravy.  Like a pool skimmer.  We had to, like, skim the surface just to get in. 
[01:09:00]  The soap scum that would be in there, even after just one bath.  Oh, man.  You want to tell the story with Quinn or no?  We used to fight over the nozzles.  One was in the front, one was in the back.  And we'd always argue back and forth who was going to be in control of the water.  They were really little.  Right.  And because it was so rare to get hot water, the first one in would take his legs and close off the tub from the hot water getting behind him where the other kid was sitting.  So, I got there first, and I eat my little, I guess, well of hot water in front. 
[01:09:30]  And I'm like, oh, hot water first, hot water.  My twin brother and I are arguing back and forth.  I'm like, no, no.  You're fighting over hot water in a bathtub.  So, he's like, fine.  You know what I mean?  It's a horror.  You're not going to have any hot water?  I'll do it myself.  And I feel this trickle down my back.  I turn around, and he's beating on me.  Oh, the disaster. 
[01:10:00]  I hope that made the air.  Oh, my God.  World War III.  Basically, in case it didn't make the air, yeah.  His brother decided to make his own hot water, and then Brett turned around at the wrong time.  There you go.  Let's see what Ben's writing.  Yeah, it was dumb.  Oh, it was dumb.  That was dumb.  He made his own hot water with his own hot water.  And when you turned around because you felt something on your back, all of a sudden, when you turned around, now it wasn't on your back anymore. 
[01:10:30]  It was on your front.  Oh, because my mouth was...  And due to your screaming, you can only imagine what was happening.  All right.  All right.  I think we all know.  Well, there's just a little peek.  We can't tell them all today.  It's funny.  By the last bath, I think bathed up was like the garbage compactor in Star Wars.  Oh, I'm a big snake in there.  We need to have a family day at the studio.  I have an air. 
[01:11:00]  3PO!  3PO!  Open the door!  I'm going to the compactor level!  What?  Queen!  Yeah, one of these days we'll do that.  All right.  I'm out.  There was the family vacation story.  That's really, really disturbing.  And you made me think of someone I haven't thought of in years.  Karen.  Karen.  The hot Karen.  The hot Karen.  We've got her name in the cement.  Very good.  The cement's still there?  Oh, yeah.  And your names are all in it?  Oh, yeah.  I've got to take a picture of it now. 
[01:11:30]  Here you go.  Come on.  That's a popular thing you put on the website now.  All right, guys.  You done?  Yep.  All right.  There they go, Mike.  A couple of my brothers.  I don't know how you got this far.  That is really bad.  No, Karen was not sold off into slavery, Rick.  How do you know?  You don't know where she went.  I have no idea.  Is he here?  Yeah.  I hope he enjoyed the last half hour. 
[01:12:00]  Anthony, we've got to take a break, but Bill Dwyer's here.  Yes.  You may know him from BattleBots.  BattleBots, one of our faves.  The creator?  I mean, what's the deal?  He's one of the comedians.  Oh, he's one.  Okay, I know who he is.  I know who he is.  All right.  We'll talk to Bill next.  Stay there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The sickest, most disgusting people having sick sex.  This is going to help him continue being number one, right?  Yeah.  That means you're the most. 
[01:12:30]  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And, uh, Anthony, do you know what to do?  If I don't know, you're trying to push a button.  Uh, what button should I push?  Push the pretty red button.  Oh, it's retarded.  That's what you get when you put unprofessionals on.  1-0-2-7.  We are a bunch of retards.  W-N-E-W.  All right, man.  Relax. 
[01:13:00]  The magic box, yeah.  I get it.  Shut up!  Shut up!  I did get that lung power from my mom, by the way. 
[01:13:30]  It's not a right boy!  The magic box!  The aliens let me have no fear.  You stupid bitch!  I did get it.  I did go poopy!  Wow!  I hit a trend!  Right, like I'm some hippie Indian 
[01:14:00]  Okay, brother  I miss that Volkswagen bus, Anthony  Yeah, I bet  Life seemed so simple back then  That's a simple, innocent time, huh?  212-757-1027  Chris, oh no, wait  Rich from Patchogue

All right, we've got to move on  Bill Dwyer's been waiting a long time  Yes  Gabe, what's going on?  Hey, Opa, hey, what's going on?  Hey, buddy  Hey, listen, I've got a feeling I know where Hot Karen is  Where?  Underneath that cement  Hey, you know, there might be something to that

It is Friday  Beer, coffee, my favorite combination  Sweet  Got my cans on  All right  You're rocking, right?  Listen to that awesome voice coming through the microphone  Hey, where are the nude women?  He's very modest  All I heard was, ah, this guy's got nude women up there all the time  And the guys out front were like, oh, no, there's a drought going on  Yeah, now it's a sausage fest in here  I know 
[01:16:00]  You know, there is a drought  But we're in the middle of a drought  We'd be up for any girl that wants to come down here  Some sort of a telethon, something  Show and give a little flash  How long are you going to hang for?  I don't care  As long as it takes to get a new chick  Until a new chick comes in here  All right, it's Tuesday now  Bill Dwyer, barely awake or alive  Come on, give Bill Dwyer a wow  Get your ass down here  It's the nude chick marathon with Bill Dwyer  Yeah, it's right in the middle of everything, right?  Geez, you know  Someone has to take one for the team and get their asses up here, okay? 
[01:16:30]  We dropped the ball here  I never get to see nude chicks  Yeah, I bet  We didn't know what you were about  We could have got the lesbian couch going  We could have done something cool  Oh, see?  You know that couch you were sitting on?  Everybody loves lesbian  You know the couch you were sitting on?  Yeah  Oh, really?  More action than the arena there at BattleBots, I've got to tell you  We don't sit on that couch, Bill  I wish I'd brought some Febreze  Yeah, you're going to need a body condom  DNA samples on that thing  It looks like you're going to have body glitter on your butt 
[01:17:00]  Well, I came here on the train, so  Ah, and any excuse  The train, that's where the body glitter came from  For the perfume  I'm all loaded with stink and stuff  And the train, don't worry  That's what it is  Nothing smells like stripper whore, though  You can't cover that up and say it's the train  Do strippers go to work on the train?  Never  And if they run late, do they start stripping on the train?  That's how the body glitter got on me, hon  I was working out of the house  We have a whole thing on body glitter  Really?  Yeah, Anthony, you've got to explain the body 
[01:17:30]  Hold on one sec, though  Veronica?  Yeah  You want to come down?  Yeah  How close are you, though?  We need a girl that's pretty close  About 15 minutes from the Lincoln Tunnel  15 minutes from the Lincoln Tunnel  You're on the Jersey side  So that means nothing to me  If you can get here in time, that'll be great  Yeah, hurry up  Hurry up, right?  All right  And bring eight friends  Yes  We need some backups  Because I don't know if Veronica's going to make it in time  Absolutely  Explain the body glitter thing to Bill  Well, when you come home, you have body glitter on you 
[01:18:00]  There is no excusing it  There is no getting it off of you  It can only mean you touched a girl that had body glitter on her  There's no other excuse for it  You can't say, well, Bob at the office was wearing some of that body glitter  It is no excuse for it  It was casual Friday, he had that body glitter  Body glitter, what the hell?  So when you go home, and it's not like it washes off  Oh, it doesn't?  Well, there'll be a piece of it  And when you walk in, that glimmer of light hits just right 
[01:18:30]  It, oh, glares in the girl's eyes  What's that?  You can explain hair away  You can go, oh, yeah  Some woman was rubbing her hair  I had a woman in chemo or something  I was just shedding at work  Anything  But body glitter  I was doing a benefit for chemo  A girl came up to congratulate me and thank me  And shed all over  A couple of hair fell onto my shoulder  Anything  Lipstick's enough where you can see it  And go, let me get that off of me  Oh, yeah  But body glitter, you go, oh, I got some body glitter 
[01:19:00]  Let me wipe it off  No, now it's just on your hand and neck  Oh  So you've got to watch the body glitter  Has that ever happened to you?  No, I've heard from people  That this is happening  We've all heard  Yeah, if you see that sparkle of that  You've got to get away  Yeah, yeah, you get away  Go wipe yourself  It's hard enough  It's hard enough getting stripper smell off you  Because they're dancing  They're sweating  They're perfuming  And if they come up and give you that big hug  Because you bought them a drink  Or something  You gave them a five instead of a single 
[01:19:30]  You go home  You're driving home  You're like, ah, I smell like whore  I smell like whore  So you get as much as your body as you possibly can  To hang outside the window of the car  Just drive it home  Yeah, try to air out  Yeah, open up everything  What's the  Doesn't work  What's strippers smell like anyway?  It's  Whiskey and licorice  That's what it is  That's what they love  Whiskey and licorice  I throw Twizzlers up on stage  Oh, they're so happy  Because they're generally such a happy bunch 
[01:20:00]  Aren't they, strippers?  I'm so proud of my life choices  And they really, really like you  When you're sitting there  They're there because they like you  I can understand that  And nothing's better than when they come up  When you're sitting at the bar  One that isn't dancing  Comes up and tries to get that drink out of you  That champagne drink that costs 20 bucks  I can't stand  Oh, man  Now, I don't go a lot  But sure  Just enough to learn  But I know  Ben, you know  I know  And you can't go anymore  You know, because I'm married  So I can't say to my wife  Oh, I'm not going for the 
[01:20:30]  I'm not going for the boobs  I'm going for the $8 apple juices  That's why I'm going to the strip club  Yeah  It's unfiltered  It's a new, fresh crop  It's worth the price  Yeah  But, oh, man  When they give you the hard sell  When they start  Come on, come on  Let me give you that  It's like an Armenian car salesman  Come on, buddy  Come on, buddy  Come on, buddy  Come on, buddy  Come on, you want me  How wild  Now they're coming up to you  I need that  It used to be the old days  Where you would just go into  A local strip club  In your local town  You'd be able to just sit down 
[01:21:00]  You'd have  You'd get your $8 beer  You'd have the two singles  Left over from your $10  That was good  A couple of girls come over  You shove the buck in  They're happy  They move on  You knew the girls  From high school  It didn't matter  Sure  It was fun  Before your eyes  Really adjust from that  Outside light  They kind of look okay  Oh, my God  You tutored me  When you walk out of the place  You look like Mandela  Just released you  Glaring at the light  Rubanger  Rubanger  Right  You can't see  But their eyesight  Is amazing, too  You pull out your wad of money 
[01:21:30]  And they come from  Every corner  Oh, yeah  From the strip club  Like ants on the sugar cube  Like ants on the sugar cube  Where the seagulls  Attacking that piece of bread  At the beach  You know what I think  You've got to do  Is ignore them  You know, a little reverse psychology  You just bring a newspaper with you  Just stop reading  Don't even look  Hey, look at this guy  He doesn't care so much  Don't even come to you  Yeah  That's a good one  I notice you've got to get next  To the loser guy  That really thinks they like him  And he's pulling the dollar bills out  Because then you're honing in  On his act  He's paying all the money 
[01:22:00]  You're leaning over  I'm seeing everything he's seeing  I'm just off by a good  Three, four degrees  On the view  I'll just put my chin  Right on that guy's shoulder  He doesn't even know  He doesn't even know  It doesn't matter  No, it doesn't  I'll start blowing in his ear  He gets all crazy  And then the show  Boy, dollars  Come out  Yours  We have a G-string diva  On the line  Melanie  How you doing?  Hey, what's up?  So I'm at work last night  I work at a strip club  In Manhattan  And some guy has 
[01:22:30]  Like makeup all over his shirt  And he's like freaking out  You know, it's one of those guys  That he always wonders  What's on his credit card statement  You know  In INB restaurants  In the naked business  Is what I always say  Anyway  So we're trying to give him like tips  As far as how to get it off  Because if he goes home  You never knew that  INB  In the naked business  What's your name?  Melanie  Call me Mel  Alright  If he goes home  His wife's going to freak out  Which is ridiculous in my opinion  But anyway  So just regular soap and water  And he rubs it  And it actually came out 
[01:23:00]  So if that ever happens to you  Trust me, it works  Not body glitter  Well, not body glitter  But at least makeup  Because you get makeup  All over that white shirt  And you're screwed  Well, how much makeup  Does a stripper wear?  You have no idea  It's not much, I don't think  Oh, are you kidding me?  There's makeup all over their body  All over?  All over  No kidding  I never would have thought that  It's like cream and all that kind of crap  What's it like backstage at a strip club?  It's just pillow fights  And mystery date, isn't it?  It's just a mystery date

Crazy  You're a crazy looking old man  Who sleeps in a hyperbaric chamber, no doubt  You want some heroin or something?  We got that, too  Anything cold  Whatever you need, man  That's just what Larry King's did  What do you think keeps me young?  Horse  The harin 
[01:30:30]  Bill's the blonde guy from BattleBots  Yeah  Just so the listeners  The modest guy from BattleBots  He's always talking about how good he is  I grew the goatee so I don't look so much like Anne Heche  Man, that's a drag  God damn  People coming up to you on the street  Hey, you're fatter and flatter than what we thought  Are you still a lesbian?  How do you answer that?  Well, I enjoy the V, but I don't have one  What is that? 
[01:31:00]  Bill's playing Stress Factory  New Brunswick, New Jersey  Tonight and Saturday  732-545-HA-HA  Ha-ha  He was talking during commercials  That he was kind of like  Walking down 7th Avenue to get here, you know  Oh, yeah  It's kind of cool  He had a TRL going on  Oh, you were watching the TRL?  Carson!  Carson!  I had a big sign  Carson, I'll blow you!  Carson!  Carson!  Well, somebody gave it to him  And then I read it  And I was like, oh, man 
[01:31:30]  I've got to redo this sign  It's strange down there in Times Square  A lot different than it used to be  Yeah  And Giuliani's really cleaned it up  Yeah, I was down there  But I think when it was scummy  And it was pretty cool  Wasn't it fun?  Yeah, it was kind of cool  It was so bad  Just always kind of, you know  Kind of weird, you know  Just a little bit of fear  Yeah  I had that little bit of fear  As you were walking around  Because your friends that were familiar with New York  Or at least said to you that they were  They would tell you the story?  They'd tell you the story  It's like, don't walk down the side street, man 
[01:32:00]  Because I tell you  You walk 10 feet off  And you just get mugged  And the hooker will proposition you  Don't get the BJ  Because she puts a razor blade under her tongue  And it's just like nightmares  So you're walking around going  I'm petrified  Petrified  And there's no fear now  When you look up and see  Oh, he's coming to the Disney store  Yeah  What happened to the BJ's?  Yeah  Gone  Giuliani's such a tight ass  He cleaned everything up  And raked it, I think  Where did all those people go then?  Where did everyone go? 
[01:32:30]  They went to the outskirts  Which is where?  They're going toward the river  Like a block over?  They're going toward the rivers  Oh, are they doing that?  They're spreading out  Oh, yeah  They can't be as big  You watch the old movies  Like you watch Taxi Driver  Yeah  In New York  And you look at the scenes of Times Square  Or even an old episode of The Odd Couple  And it just looks filthy  And disgusting  And it's New York  Nice layer of scum  Just scum  And the old buses  Big smoke puffing out  I was frightened to come into the city  When I was a kid 
[01:33:00]  We'd go on field trips  To the Museum of Natural History  Come out from Long Island  And it would be like  Get off the bus  Into the museum  You wander around  Because God forbid you got lost  You'd be a prepubescent hooker  Being whored out by a pimp  Happened to me  Don't lie  Happened to me  I missed the bus  Sure, I enjoyed the money  One minute I'm looking at the T-Rex  And the next minute  A guy named T-Rex  It's awful  Hey Keith, what's going on, bud?  Hey, can hosting a show like BattleBots 
[01:33:30]  Get you laid, or what?  How do you work that way?  They'd be having honeys in the crowd  Yeah  Yo, that's off the hook, Pete  That is the one place where I get recognized  You know, but there's not a lot of honeys  In the BattleBots crowd  I will say that  No, I've seen some  I've seen some females  I wouldn't quite call them honeys  Nah, I've seen honeys, dude  There's been honeys  Yeah  Yeah  A few episodes  There was cuties in the audience, dude  Yeah, how high were you?  All dirty  Yo, yo, Opie, man  Yo, what's up?  BattleBots 
[01:34:00]  There's no honeys in the BattleBot audience  It's all a perception thing, you know?  Yeah, what's the hottie?  They'd be going for them MIT PhD cats  He's looking at it  He's basing it on the curve  You've got to recognize where you are  And a hottie at a BattleBots competition is probably  Yeah, by the way, Bill, you haven't been introduced  That's Old Dirty  Yeah  Old Dirty  Everyone's favorite felon  I would  I'm innocent  I would move your wallet to the front pocket  For the rest of your visit here 
[01:34:30]  I'm definitely buying a fake watch while I'm here  Oh, yeah  Yo, go down to 42nd, you get yourself a slammin' Rolex, dude  Really?  $20  Yeah  How much?  $20  $20  If you're a gag  It got the big window  You should be able to get it for $10, am I right?  Right  Yo, it got the big window and everything, dude  It looks like a Rolex  Really?  Yeah, I don't pump fake watches, though  Yeah  No?  I don't pump fake watches  That's what it's Reesey, you know what I'm saying?  That's what I am, it's Reesey  People can see it out there  I'm looking at the buildings  Oh, what a cool city 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, they tell you don't look up, either, if you're a tourist  I know, I've heard that  Yeah  But the thing is, the tourist  Ray's laid under the tongue  Ray's under the tongue  You know yourself, right?  You deserve to be killed by someone with that kind of talent  But then you're not looking up  You're not seeing that brick that's falling on your head from a building  Or the crane  Or the crane  Or the guy that decides to end his life as you're walking underneath him  Or the homeless guy that somehow finds a cobblestone and bashes your brains in  Because, I don't know, you're Satan 
[01:35:30]  All the buildings are dripping in New York  I don't know what it is, but you're walking down the street and buildings are dripping on you  Ah, yes  You've got to watch that  You don't want to know  That's where the people went  Are they getting aroused?  Is it the drop that comes out as you're getting ready?  Have you noticed there's no public bathrooms in Manhattan?  Uh, no, I went here  Nice  Nice  I went in here  Nice  But no, I didn't try going in  Yeah  Because I look like a cop, kind of  I look like the  I bet you could be mistaken for the cop  Yeah, you do too, man 
[01:36:00]  Oh, really?  You got such the surfer, colonel  Surfer, colonel  That's it, I'm the rat, though  I'm the cop that goes to internal affairs  I'm the cop, I'm the cop, I'm the cop  He looks like a ball-buster TNT anti-crime  He does  That's right, that's what I like  What am I going for?  Never wear the wire  Because they always, man  Has anyone ever worn a wire on a show and not gotten into trouble?  Yeah, exactly  You never wear the wire  Yeah  The red-headed guy from NYPD Blue 
[01:36:30]  Yeah  The movie that he did  Back when he was  Man, what was that guy thinking?  When you're making career decisions  You gotta not talk to a clown  I don't know what he was thinking  He must have called up Ringling Brothers  Look, you guys all jump out of a tiny car  Should I go into movies?  David Caruso  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  That's the guy  He made that movie Jade  I think that was the one  And then he did that one with Nicolas Cage  Yeah, yeah  That's a good place, though  And he wore the wire  That was pretty good  He wore the wire and he tore it off in the bathroom 
[01:37:00]  And threw it out the window  Yeah  And then Nicolas Cage stripped all his clothes off him  And then hugged him  And that's all I remember  Great movie  We gotta go to Ben here real fast  Ben, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  All right  Listen, I don't think all the Hummers are gone from Times Square  One more try, Ben, go  I don't think all the Hummers are gone from Times Square  I think it's only a matter of time before they come back  What, is it like a BJ Tide? 
[01:37:30]  He thinks the Hummers are gone back in?  Oh, that's the hell  It's just the Tide's down  It'll be back  I think now with Giuliani's changes in the future  You're gonna have Mickey Mouse coming up  To you sounding like all dirty  Going, hey, man  I'll blow you for some cheese  I do that  Get a better phone, dick  I love that  But I love cheese  Giuliani is the Tide-ass, though, that has ruined it  He's so repulsed by the sight of nude women  That I don't think you can handle it  And those are the people you gotta be afraid of 
[01:38:00]  Yeah  If you look at a nude chick  And you're just like, yeah, that's cool  But if you're so uptight about it  There are some mental problems you got  There's something deep  There's something really deep  We got in trouble  Well, I think you gotta do that when you're the mayor  But is he still married?  Wasn't he getting divorced or something?  Yeah, that's what it is  He's banging this other chick  He's still married  Who the hell does he think he is?  Me?  No, no  Are you married?  I was  I'm in the process  But you see  You're in the process  Different than Giuliani 
[01:38:30]  And it is, mind you  I don't care if there's chicks driving down Broadway naked  Giuliani, on the other hand  Yeah, of course you know  You're getting divorced  Go on  Well, so is he  That's a great thing  So is he  Is that your first marriage that you're getting divorced from?  First and last, my man  Really?  Oh, that's what you say  No, that's what I know  And then you'll meet some chick who gives you back rubs and light candles  That's fine and dandy  No, no  That's all fine and dandy  But getting married again?  Never  Yo, Antonio 
[01:39:00]  How long have you been married?  Uh, what?  Thirteen years  Thirteen years  Yeah  Forever  Forever  You got kids?  For a long time  Yeah, I got kids  See, I didn't have any kids  So it made it a little easier  Yeah  Punch out Maverick  Punch out Maverick  We're going in  You're in a flat spin  I don't care if a goose bites it  I'm out of here  You're laughing  Yo, you don't want to marry a Mexican for 5G real quick?  What, to keep her in the country?  Yeah  I don't know about that  Yeah, man, do it 
[01:39:30]  Hey, come on, man  You're pimping me off to a Mexican  I know, he's got a list  He's going to break out his palm pot  Yo, that's the big thing around the way, though  Before they enacted, like, all the immigration laws  Yeah  My brothers was getting married quick for 6, 7 G's  Really?  And then what do they do?  Just get a divorce?  Yeah, you know, you bang them  And then you walk around  Well, then you got to stay married to them for a while  For like a year, right?  For like a year, two years  You know, you go to get the sex on the side  And then you get divorced  And you're richer  Yeah  But you can't do that because you're on radio 
[01:40:00]  I know  You are screwed  I can't do it, believe me  I know  You're very, uh, any sort of immigrant  You keep it on the low-low, kid  Keep it on the QT on the low-low  He's got a whole other language we don't understand  Nor are we supposed to  Yeah, right  Am I right?  Yeah  That's not true  I'm not supposed to understand on the low-low or  Well, middle America  Sure, when I'm drinking a 40 ounce, I drip up a little  You drink 40 ounce?  I drip a little on the carpet for my homies 
[01:40:30]  You know what I'm saying?  The 40 of Tom  Am so light  I am so light  To my homies  How are you doing?  I got a dentist friend who broke a finger  I don't have any homies  Give a little to him  A pal of mine really bought it in the market  Little to him  Those tech stocks really hurt him  Little of the Heineken for my buddy  For all the homies that dropped a few G's 
[01:41:00]  In the tech industry  I got a buddy who just had to give up his second house  Let me tip this for you  Yo, you guys are tearing up a tradition  Yeah  No, it's a tradition  We should never, you know  There's certain things  Certain languages  People shouldn't like rap, you know  They're not supposed to  Oh, so you don't like Eminem?  Huh?  No, you know what?  But we got Eminem at the house  We got the Marshall Mathers LP at the household 
[01:41:30]  Oh, yeah  Yeah  You feel it?  Wow, you are  Yeah  You are ghetto, my man  You are ghetto  He's not aiming for me, you know  Hey, man  I hope this album sells to basic cable  Get your show hosts  I hope this  I hope robot show hosts buy my album  I'm sure that's what Eminem said  Robot show hosts  I hope robot show hosts who are working in New Brunswick  Are buying this album 
[01:42:00]  That should sell four or five  It's doing  I tell you though  Battle Boss is doing really well  Yeah, it's great  Because everyone I know  I haven't missed an episode  Yeah  I know all the robots by name  It's crazy  But there are some of them I had a problem with  One was that goddamn fire truck  The fire truck  The two chicks with the fire truck  Yeah  With the Lee kid doll in it  Yeah  I like the lady  And it wasn't really the Lee jeans doll  They just called him that  They just called him Buddy Lee  Don't play  Buddy Lee don't play in the street
