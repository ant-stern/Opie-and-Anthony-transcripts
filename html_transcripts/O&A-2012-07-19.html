<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the aftermath of a severe New York storm, focusing on the hosts' personal experiences with power outages and humorous anecdotes, such as one host using his car's engine to charge electronics and employing night vision goggles.  They extensively mocked CNN weatherman Chad Myers' and co-host Carol's coverage of Hurricane Katrina, using vulgar language to describe their perceived interactions.  The planned installation of a large underground fuel tank for a home generator was also discussed, along with the host's aversion to silence and darkness, leading to tangential humor.  A significant portion of the show analyzed George Zimmerman's Sean Hannity interview following the Trayvon Martin shooting, dissecting Zimmerman's statements and criticizing the media's portrayal of the events, again using strong and offensive language.  The show briefly touched on the British Open, Jim Norton's birthday, and a recurring hair-related segment.

The broadcast continued with a caller recounting his parents' volatile relationship and its impact on his own marriage, which ended after his wife's public intoxication and other embarrassing incidents.  His brother's precocious behavior in the 1970s was also detailed.  A studio guest, presumably Jimmy, and the hosts engaged in a humorous debate about the merits of grapes in a tuna fish sandwich.  Further analysis of the Hannity-Zimmerman interview followed, questioning Zimmerman's account and the media's bias.  The hosts watched and commented on a video of Jim Norton getting beaten up by MMA fighters, offering descriptive and humorous observations.  Jim Florentine, a guest on the show, shared his experiences living with his mother-in-law, and the caller detailed his participation in threesomes.

Anthony then recounted his own experiences with threesomes, the resulting relationship with one of the women, and the fallout with his wife.  He described modifying his work van to avoid traffic tickets and using it to transport his jet ski.  A phone call with Anthony's ex-girlfriend, Melinda, revealed details about their relationship and her reasons for a past glass-throwing incident. The show promoted upcoming events and appearances for Jim Florentine, a donation drive for the Steve C. Fund, and their Chicago live broadcast, including a pig race.  Louis C.K.'s Emmy nomination and Andrew Dice Clayâ€™s weight loss and smoking habits were also discussed. Florentine and later Dice Clay were guests in the studio.

Dice Clay recounted a disastrous wedding, focusing on the appearance of female guests, particularly their bare feet, and described a negative encounter with Bonnie McFarlane.  He vehemently denied disliking female comedians, clarifying that he dislikes *unfunny* ones, and engaged in a vulgar discussion of his comedy and preferences.

A significant portion of the show revolved around Jim Norton's birthday celebration, which involved Adrian, a member of Dennis Rodman's topless basketball team.  The hosts made repeated, vulgar attempts to persuade Adrian to remove her top, leading to a heated argument punctuated by highly offensive language.  Adrian consistently refused.

The next segment featured a female dancer, Lainey, as a guest.  The hosts and Dice Clay engaged in sexually charged conversation focusing on Lainey's physical attributes, leading to a confrontational exchange.  Discussions covered Lainey's ethnicity and dating preferences.  Jimmy Norton's disappointment about Lainey not showing him her breasts on his birthday was repeatedly mentioned.  After much discussion and negotiation, Jimmy Norton cut the top of Lainey's shirt with scissors, revealing her breasts.  The show ended with further discussion of the event,  Dice Clay promoting his upcoming shows, and a near-accident involving a producer knocking Lainey into a door.

The final segment opened with jokes about Lainey's minor injury.  The hosts celebrated Jim Florentine's marriage and family, promoted upcoming appearances by Dice Clay and Florentine,  wished Jim Norton a happy birthday, and concluded with plugs for upcoming shows and station information.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do that. Good morning, everybody.  Hello.  Now, I know we're going to talk about weather and the lights going out and all that.  Yeah.  Do people around the country care?  Yeah, because their lights have gone out at some point in their life, so they can relate.  We had a crazy storm here in New York. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  New York, Long Island, Connecticut, Jersey.  Wow.  Pretty badass.  Temperatures were, what, over 100 yesterday?  Yeah, we had a cold front move in over the warm weather, and boy, did that shake up the atmosphere.  Well, it had a lot of energy to work off.  I'm trying to tell you about barometric pressure.  What was that guy's name? That weatherman on CNN.  Oh.  Oh, find him. I hate that guy. 
[00:01:00]  That was funny as fuck.  Chad.  Chad.  Chad sucks.  Chad.  Chad.  Chad.  Chad.  Yeah, we'll play that for everybody.  They can appreciate that dumb clip.  Yeah.  Well, you know, when you have that happen, there's a lot of energy that the storm could work off.  Oh, man.  Boy.  Talking heavy rains.  Wind, lightning.  Lightning everywhere.  I've never seen more lightning strikes in my life.  Nature's light show.  Lightning just hitting all around me.  Damn nature, you scary. 
[00:01:30]  So you don't get to see that shit living low on the ground like you do.  No, but I certainly saw a good light show.  You saw the light show?  It was cray.  The lightning strikes hit the Hudson River, and then it kicks up everything from the bottom.  Yeah.  A few lightning strikes, you know, close to shore on the Hudson River, and then it looks  like it's oil or something coming up for a little bit.  It's the silty bottom.  Oh, no shit.  I have a silty bottom.  Is that the clip?  All right. 
[00:02:00]  Here's Chad Myers.  All right.  He's all in with his weather.  This is during Katrina.  Which I guess...  Is it?  Yeah.  It's a big moment.  A couple of hours ago, so it has filled in a little bit.  Filled in with some air.  Okay, so, Chad.  That is lower pressure, but Camille...  Let me talk, Carol.  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would let me talk...  Camille.  There's a better version of it that goes a little longer, because I didn't know he threw  his papers in disgust.  He's so angry. 
[00:02:30]  I hate Carol, too, though.  That is lower pressure.  Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad, let me translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would let me talk...  Camille.  Camille was 908.  And so this is actually now not as...  In the Northern Hemisphere, unless you were obviously trying to get under a hurricane.  All right.  Thank you, Chad.  All right.  And then he was like, just kidding or something.  But he wasn't just kidding.  No, he wasn't.  He wanted to call her an interrupting cunt.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Is she still on that Carol Brugge?  I don't know if I've seen her.  That was so great.  He's just babbling on about barometric pressure, and which hurricane had the lowest barometric  pressure, and what barometric pressure was on this barometric pressure.  And she was just not having it.  He was rambling about nothingness.  There's an exciting fucking killer storm.  And he's talking these science geek numbers.  Chad!  Chad!  Chad!  Oh, God.  That emasculating bitch. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  That condescending fucking tone.  Yeah.  If you want to piss off a guy, use that tone, ladies.  Oh, man.  You're never going to get our proper attention with...  Chad!  Chad!  Chad!  Chad can't get a fucking rigid rod.  A turgid boner.  It's all noodley.  And she just goes, Chad!  Like, look at that thing.  And he's all just sitting there.  I can't...  I don't know what happened.  It's not very tumescent.  No.  Is that the word?  I was trying to remember.  Tumescent.  Tumescent look.  I don't know.  I think you're right. 
[00:04:00]  I think you got it.  Anyway, the storm was pretty impressive.  And I guess, what?  You lost your power again?  I lost my goddamn power.  I'm...  Where are your light poles?  Up above ground?  This is the dumbest fucking thing.  Low ground.  I live in, you know, the place I live in Nassau County, Long Island, the area, it's one of  your older neighborhoods that they've plowed asunder, these older houses, and built up these  bigger houses and whatnot. 
[00:04:30]  But they still have the power lines strung over the property lines of everything on telephone  poles with these giant fucking units, these big transformer units on the poles.  And the power just goes out when you have these big lightning storms.  You hear like a...  And then...  You see the whole thing go.  The power goes out.  You're a big bang, and then the power goes out.  Looks like a firework.  Yeah.  And then you don't know what the fuck is going on.  Mm-hmm.  So that happened yesterday, I guess, about 7 o'clock or so, last night. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, that's prime time for you.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So I'm sitting around.  It's still kind of light out.  So I'm just sitting around going, eh, it'll come back on before it gets dark.  No.  So what?  You go out...  Oh, you can't go outside, obviously.  It's just nothing to do.  It's lightning and thunder and rain.  So...  And then it starts getting dark, and I'm like, all right, I'm going to have to start lighting  candles.  I have a portable generator, but something's going on with the voltage, and it just burns 
[00:05:30]  out everything I plug into it.  It's a little too high.  I saw one of your tweets, and what, the town's holding you up?  Well, that's with my big generator that I'm having installed at the house.  But you own your house and your property, why can't you just get a generator for your  house?  I need to put in a fuel tank, a big fuel tank, underground at my house to hold, like, mega  gallons of fuel for the generator.  Wow, you're going all in.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Where are you putting the tank? 
[00:06:00]  Underneath where the generator is, in the backyard, and the generator will go behind my pool house,  and it's giant.  It's like half the size of my cabana.  Now I almost understand, you know, the town on this one.  I didn't realize it was, I thought it was an easy fix.  No, this is giant.  I sort of understand.  It's like a fucking freight train in my backyard.  Because I know we hate local government and everything they force you to do just to live  in your own home.  Yeah.  But, all right, so you're waiting for a permit so you can get a tank in your backyard. 
[00:06:30]  So I can put a tank in my backyard.  How many gallons is that going to hold?  I don't know, fucking a thousand something.  Really?  I don't know, it's a lot.  How big is the tank?  It's giant.  But how?  Like, is it a bat?  Like a large bat?  It's like a trunk.  A truck.  Really?  It's like they're burying a truck.  Where do they put it?  Are they burying it?  Yeah, they bury it in the yard.  Wow.  Somewhere.  Just bury it.  And then, yeah, they hook the whole thing up, and then it goes directly into your electrical  system.  So then you have, and you have battery backup for all your computers and electronic devices.  So the power goes out, the battery backup takes over immediately, and then right after 
[00:07:00]  that, the generator kicks in, feeds your electrical system immediately for your entire house.  You don't even have to stop doing what you're doing.  Wow.  And I can turn everything on in my house.  And you're only going to use that maybe twice a year.  Yeah.  Don't care for that twice a year.  But why not twice a year just have the fun of not having lights?  Just shut my power off?  You know, and just deal with it.  Because it's not very fun.  Remember when your lights used to go out, you would just go to bed? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, when I was eight.  You would just go to bed, though.  It would get dark, and you dealt with the candles for, I don't know, 15 minutes and said,  you know what, I'm just going to bed.  Yeah.  There's nothing else to do.  I can't do that, though.  I don't like silence, and I don't like the dark very much.  And that's the two things you get during a blackout.  Oh, no.  You don't like the dark?  Oh, no.  I don't like silence or the dark.  Oh, no.  What happened to me, Jimmy?  Jimmy's flowchart.  It's Jimmy's flowchart.  I had a pee-pee in my hiney.  Is the flowchart on the door there, Travis? 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  Could you explain the flowchart?  We haven't talked about Jimmy's flowchart in a while.  Isn't that the one?  Oh, that's not Jimmy's?  No, that's another.  Which flowchart is that?  Oh, that's management's flowchart?  Yeah, the same way.  Did you do a good job?  Wait, what is that flowchart?  I love the flowchart.  This is a great one, too.  And then we'll get to Jimmy's flowchart, and we'll bring everyone back on point.  Well, on top it says, did you do good?  Right.  And then it can go yes, or it can go no.  Right.  And they both lead to, we have a problem. 
[00:08:30]  That is SiriusXM in a nutshell.  Right.  It's a simple flowchart.  And Jimmy's is very similar, but it all leads to molestation.  You were molested.  So, if he's scared of the dark?  No, see, you're fucking, that's, and people here are fucking it up.  I never said I'm afraid of the dark.  I just don't like the dark.  It's not entertaining to me.  It's fucking, I like being able to see things.  It's not afraid of the dark.  I don't like the dark.  Why can't you just chill?  I do chill. 
[00:09:00]  No, in a way where it's like, it's no people, no alcohol, no music.  Just sit there and just chill.  Why?  Why?  Just to, I don't know, to get a little peace.  It's boring.  Well, it is boring.  You're not supposed to do it for hours.  It's just boring to me.  Could you just sit for an hour and just chill?  No.  No.  And what do you need in that hour?  I need some type of visual audio stimulation.  Always.  I need something to tinker with. 
[00:09:30]  I need something to look at.  What's the most?  Something colorful, pinwheels spinning.  What's the most peaceful thing you do?  The most peaceful thing I do?  Let me think.  All right.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, all right.  All right.  It's a nice day out.  Yeah.  I go out back.  I lay on my lounge chair by the pool.  I turn on some music and, uh, and just shut my eyes and kind of just, you know, listen  to the tunes.  Listen to the tuneage, relax.  There you go.  The nice cocktail next to me on a table.  Having no AC stinks. 
[00:10:00]  That's the worst part of it.  Yeah.  I grew up with no AC.  Well, somebody mentioned that.  I went through everything last night.  I was, there's nothing really to do but tweet at that, uh, point in time with the power  off.  So I was fielding questions.  I was throwing out comments and people said, you know, what do you do with no AC?  It must be getting warm in the house because it's very hot.  Then I said, um, the movie theater, which is downstairs, uh, is very cool.  And it offered a tactical choke point where if, uh, anybody invaded, uh, the house, um, I 
[00:10:30]  had like a 300 style, uh, choke point to, uh, make sure no shenanigans.  So you were in there with candles?  No, I never really went to the theater.  Oh, you didn't go in there?  I stayed upstairs.  The AC thing doesn't bother me because we didn't, we didn't grow up with AC.  Oh, I need to get sick.  It's a battle in my house because I'm a non-AC guy and my wife loves AC.  Holy mother of Christ, you're not fucking...  I don't turn them off, but I could easily just, um, you know, hang out without AC.  That's insane.  I need meat locker coal.  Did you grow up with AC? 
[00:11:00]  Nope.  But that's just it.  I didn't grow up with it, so I want now.  Everything I didn't grow up with, I want now.  I want toys.  I want things.  I think that's how everyone lives their lives.  Yeah.  Did you have fans growing up?  Well, I have fans now.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He doesn't mean those kind of fans.  Oh, I'm sorry, Chippa.  Yes, I had the, like, oscillating fans.  And they're all shaky. 
[00:11:30]  And they never worked right.  No, it stunk.  They were always rubbing on something.  And my fucking dad, again, would do things like ass backwards because it was, like, what he heard.  He would put the fan in the window, but backwards.  It's blowing the hot air outside.  It's taking the hot air from the house and blowing it out.  I'm like, no, I want something blowing on me.  Yeah.  Evaporation is a cooling process.  So if you sweat and the air blows on you, the sweat evaporates off your skin, thus cooling you off. 
[00:12:00]  Thus then.  If it's blowing out, you're not getting that wind on you.  Air is weird.  I remember it would be 95 degrees.  And if you had a fan in your room, for some reason it would be cooler.  It felt cooler.  And that's dumb if you think about it.  Well, it is because that happens.  Evaporation cools you.  When you sweat and the air blows on you, it evaporates the sweat and cools your skin down.  And that's why it feels cooler when you get air blowing over you.  I thought the sweat cooled you down.  Well, technically it does because that's what it's doing. 
[00:12:30]  It's evaporating off you and cooling you down.  Do you know a very fun fact?  To this day, I sleep with my air conditioner on.  And a fan blowing on me.  A fan and air conditioning.  No, that's a good combination.  Double cooling.  That's a good combination right there.  But I also have a large humidifier.  And like, clean a giant one.  Wow.  And I have the fan behind the humidifier. 
[00:13:00]  You can't.  Blowing over at me.  It blows over the humidifier at me.  Does it just sound like a factory in your room?  It's very noisy.  Yeah, maybe that's why you're not sleeping.  Jesus.  How about you turn half that shit off?  Plus, my apnea mask makes noise.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  Shh.  Sounds like a fucking iron foundry in his house.  Jimmy loves taking care of his air.  Yeah.  I really do, man.  It's all about it.  Air.  You need conditioned air.  Yeah.  So, what I had to do to keep the most basic of technology running in my house, which is 
[00:13:30]  a computer, my phones, and the iPad.  Why do you need the computer if you have the iPad and the phone?  Well, the computers, if I want to watch something, I'd rather have the computer, the 17-inch  monitor on the computer than looking at the little phone or the iPad.  Right.  And then the phone is for tweeting.  Right.  And stuff.  And the iPad is just a little extra for tweeting. 
[00:14:00]  If I want to look at pictures or something like that, it's right there.  And so, I plugged the iPad and the phone into the computer to keep them charged, and then  I plugged the computer via extension cord into an adapter that ran to my Escalade, which  was running in my driveway for six hours.  I had an Escalade as a battery charger.  The green people are going to hate you today.  My batteries are being charged with a giant V8 engine idling in my driveway. 
[00:14:30]  Six hours, how much gas?  Probably half a tank?  Half a tank, about.  I would guess.  No, maybe less than that.  I had a half a tank this morning, and I had probably a quarter tank when I started.  So, a quarter tank.  So, for about, I don't know, what, 50, 60 bucks, you were good yesterday.  I was fucking styling right there.  Most people would do that.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  I had candles burning.  And then, when I went downstairs to get beer, I put on my night vision goggles, so I could 
[00:15:00]  go right downstairs.  Why wouldn't you just have candles wherever you want to go?  You know, candles are very dangerous.  I'm not a big fan of the candle unless I have them where I see them.  So is all the other stuff you do.  Not really.  Candles are easy.  I don't like a fire hazard.  But I have a candle in the bathroom upstairs, in the kitchen upstairs, and then in the living  room, all in one area, so I could see if any shenanigans are happening with that fire  there.  Why don't you put those little candles? 
[00:15:30]  Votive candles?  The votive candles.  Going all the way down the stairs, leading to your bar.  That's crazy.  That would be cool, though.  Nah.  I just fucking go, I go fucking...  Or you got the night vision goggles.  James Gumm version.  Night vision goggles are cool, too, though.  I'm James Gumm style.  What is fucking moth flying around your house?  There's a...  Yeah, there's...  There's a clip of James Gumm's night vision, and there's mine.  It looks very similar. 
[00:16:00]  It sure does.  That's my stove.  Would you creep out...  Would you be fucking creeped out if all of a sudden something popped out?  Oh, my God.  While you have the night vision goggles on?  You'd hear fucking bang, bang, bang in rapid succession.  When you have those things on, are you sort of scared to kind of scan the room?  Nah, it's cool as fuck, man.  Put them like night vision.  But something popping out?  Nah.  I got a pretty good fucking line of sight with that thing.  Yeah.  And I go downstairs, I pour out a pitcher of beer, instead of one glass at a time.  And I put the pitcher in the fridge.  And then, you know, you pour it out as the night goes on. 
[00:16:30]  And the fridge is staying cool, obviously.  The fridge is staying cool.  I would use my iPhone and set up a hotspot with that.  And then tie in my computer and my iPad to the iPhone hotspot.  And I got internet that way.  And I was able to watch the George Zimmerman Hannity interview, which was very important  last night.  Very important news.  And that's how I spent my night.  And then I see some flashlights going over crazy in my backyard. 
[00:17:00]  Like, what the fuck?  So I, you know, I pick up and I go to inquire.  You know, I keep it down, though.  On my leg.  One guy recently answered the door with a gun pointed out the door and was lit up by  police officers.  Was he really?  So I would suggest you don't just brandish your weapon when you open the door to somebody  that might even seem a little suspicious.  You just don't.  Gotcha.  So I opened up my slider and I'm like, hey!  Hey! 
[00:17:30]  You know, you got to do that thing.  You got to.  It shows authority.  Hey!  And I'm like, hey, Lipa, Lipa.  In your backyard?  Yeah.  So just a lot to go in your backyard?  Apparently, I was the last line in the line of electricity that they had to check to  make sure they could turn the fucking shit on.  So they check all the lines with the flashlights and stuff and make sure nobody's standing there  holding a power line in their hand before they flip the fucking switch on.  How great was that?  Yeah, yeah.  They were telling me they found one guy once that was winding it up like an extension cord 
[00:18:00]  around his arm to get it out of the street.  Good.  And another guy, it was flaming.  There was some fire going on on the insulation.  Right.  So he was pouring water on it with a plant fucking waterer.  The guy was like, yeah, a bunch of fucking assholes.  So they had to check that, and then the power came on like a couple of hours after that  at about 4 a.m.  You were up till 4?  No, I was sleeping by then.  I woke up for a few seconds when the power came back on. 
[00:18:30]  But I went to sleep.  I put a Netflix movie on, on the computer, and just went to sleep that way.  And then the power came on.  It wasn't that bad, really.  What about flashlights?  People are saying, fuck the candles.  What about flashlights?  I like candles over flashlights.  Well, flashlights really do kind of give away your position in the house.  People can see where you are.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I was hoping.  I was hoping you were kidding on that one.  Yeah.  I use flashlights, too.  Yeah.  But, you know, candles are good. 
[00:19:00]  I do like when the lights go out every once in a while.  As long as it's not a regular thing.  Really?  Get that generator.  Fucking crank that shit right up.  It's kind of exciting.  It's like you're camping.  You've got to figure shit out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I fucking can't see where you're pissing.  True.  It's, uh, nah, it's not bad.  It wasn't that bad.  Storm was unbelievable, though.  Yeah.  The news, though.  The old yard up.  I mean, it tore up the neighborhood a little bit.  A lot of downed trees.  I love weather events because I go right to the local news to watch those idiots. 
[00:19:30]  Idiot.  Fucking idiots.  Yeah.  They'll find just a tree down and report from the tree down.  Oh, they got to do that.  And they talk to the lipo guy.  They do all this basic shit.  Set up the shot in front of the tree.  Set up the shot.  Right, right.  I'll walk into the shot.  Right.  Just idiots.  If we can find some local clips, they're just the worst.  Huh?  Right here.  You got it for you?  Oh, you got one?  There it is.  Try steak cleanup.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[00:20:00]  From fierce storms.  Fox.  Yeah, Fox.  Local Fox.  This is going to be a good one, I'm sure.  They love it.  Oh, shit.  When your power was out.  Yeah.  Did you think that Gotham was being taken over?  Did you think you were in danger?  I was very frightened, Bane.  I thought, yes, I thought our fair city had been taken over.  Did you think you were going to be accused and sentenced?  No, not really.  Accused and sentenced. 
[00:20:30]  Accused and sentenced to banishment out on the...  Oops, oops, let me not spoil it.  That opens tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  I can't wait for the people to see it, and then we can talk about it.  Don't badmouth us on Rotten Tomatoes!  Yes.  Yeah.  That was a little...  I don't know.  People are getting death threats on Rotten Tomatoes for bad-mouthing the new Batman movie,  so they kind of stopped allowing people to comment on the movie. 
[00:21:00]  Really?  And rate it.  Yeah, until like tomorrow.  I think they're going to kick it back up again.  Yeah, people were commenting on reviewers who gave it a bad review.  Yeah.  But they haven't even seen the movie.  Yeah.  But apparently one man's opinion is really important.  So it got so bad that they couldn't monitor all the comments anymore, and so they just shut  them off completely.  But I'll say this much, I could see the movie getting bad reviews.  Well, yeah, I mean...  I think overall...  Everybody has their opinion.  Like, I don't know why people take critics so seriously.  Their opinions are like assholes. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, they're all fun to finger.  Some of these assholes have to give it a bad review just to be different, but I could  see where people would have problems with that movie.  I think overall, though, you know, if you took a review of all the reviewers, if that  makes sense, it's going to be a three...  Yeah, you get the average.  Probably a two and a half, three star movie.  So they're going to open up the comments again after the weekend.  I could see people having a problem.  Definitely.  Well, yeah, I mean, not everyone's going to...  Someone asked me on Twitter, I didn't answer them back, which movie was better, Spider-Man 
[00:22:00]  or Batman, because I've seen both, Spider-Man.  Ooh.  I say Spider-Man over Batman.  Spider-Man.  I was going to say something, I just can't.  Why?  Just tired.  Aw.  What is he doing?  I can't remember the voice.  You had the voice.  I had it yesterday, but I couldn't think of it today.  You just nailed it today.  Oh, I don't think that was it.  No, today I think it was even better. 
[00:22:30]  You're doing a great Bane.  A great Bane.  Speaking of Banes.  Ah, Sam.  Is that mean?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I was also posting some pictures last night because I was bored.  Yeah.  So there was one of me, Bill Burr, and Sam during the walkover.  And young Sam, man, you forget how fucking young and innocent he was.  He's standing there with a microphone, and I remember he's very new.  Why do you want your hair to be part of a bit? 
[00:23:00]  Your hair is part of a bit, you know?  Part of what bit?  You had no intention of growing your hair out.  I know, but that was years ago.  But now you have it like that because of an O&A bit.  Sometimes they are a-changing.  Yeah, but it's not still.  There it is.  Look at that.  Look at your hair, man.  There's a guy there.  That's fucked up.  It's almost shaved.  Yeah, it's so short.  It's a tight, tight dude.  I used to cut it every three weeks.  Really?  Yeah.  Whether you need it. 
[00:23:30]  On your old Burr there?  Okay.  Yeah.  Billy.  That's a creep you look like there.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You still look like a creep.  You look like a turtley man boy.  I like you better now.  Yeah, you're very.  Billy, I forgot how little fucking youngin' looking you were.  Your features have gotten a little harder with age, and probably working here has put  quite a few years on you.  I think so.  He fucking started out all innocent like a little hobbit character, and now he's Sergeant  Barnes.  I was a motherfucker.  It's all the eyebrows, by the way.  If you trimmed down those eyebrows, you would think? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, you'd be five years younger.  Because he's got big eyebrows there.  Not as big.  Study that picture.  No, you're right.  I don't know.  They're getting bushier.  We'll check the profile then.  Yeah, no.  They're.  His features aren't as like chiseled out.  They're rounder and softer.  Let's just put it this way.  As a twink.  I no longer believe you have candy in your head.  No.  Thank God.  That's a candy head right there.  Yeah, absolutely.  Candy in his head.  Yeah.  I was thinking about Steve last night, and Steve was all in trying to get candy out of  your head.  Oh, right.  That was his. 
[00:24:30]  I always appreciated that, because we came up with this dumb thing that we think Sam's  skull was full of candy, because of his innocence and his red cheeks.  It's just not there anymore.  It's just not there at all.  But Steve would try all sorts of ways to get the candy out of your head.  He was all in.  He used to physically shake my head.  Oh, yeah.  He would twist your ears, try to come up with some kind of combo that would release the candy  from your head.  He'd hold both your ears and put the candy searching device in your mouth.  I'm going to get candy. 
[00:25:00]  Ah, shit.  So the lights went on at four, and you're back to normal there.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  So I spent a lot of time tweeting, and especially about the Zimmerman thing.  That was big news last night.  Hannity with a coup.  Yeah, big.  With a coup getting in an interview with George Zimmerman, and very open and honest.  The lawyer barely stepped in for anything.  Right.  And Sean was asking him questions about everything, every subject that people have been asking 
[00:25:30]  questions about.  I saw a guy that looked very composed.  He comes off looking a lot younger and a lot more less threatening in real life than he  does in his mug shots and the pictures the media has shown.  very articulate, not a tough guy, and what he was saying seems to jibe with the evidence  that has been made public so far. 
[00:26:00]  And I honestly, sincerely think this guy's walking.  I think he's walking, and I don't even think it's going to be fucking close.  He said he was walking.  Didn't he say, I'm only reading quotes, but that he was walking.  No!  And, uh, well, technically he was called to stop by the police.  Oh, God, how many times I have to answer that fucking thing.  People are really dumb.  They just don't know what the fuck.  He, you know, the police told him, do not follow.  No, they didn't.  No one fucking even said that.  The 911 operator says, we don't need you to do that, when he said he was going to follow 
[00:26:30]  Trayvon to see, you know, where he's going.  He's a neighborhood watch guy.  Now, where did, where did they confront him?  Where did Trayvon confront him?  Because I always thought, I mean, it looked like they had some, obviously a fight, but  that Trayvon probably just fucking popped him.  Because if, if, if he's telling the truth.  Well, why don't we go through the audio?  He was on the phone.  Why don't we go through the audio?  Yeah, we could do that.  Sure.  And then, uh, we could fill in the blanks here.  Sure.  Uh, George Zimmerman and, uh, Hannity in a hotel room, right? 
[00:27:00]  And he went down to Florida?  Yes, he did.  He went down to Florida and interviewed, uh, George Zimmerman.  How'd they secure him in a hotel room?  Oh.  It was all top secret, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Zimmerman says he wasn't afraid of Trayvon and explains what he was saying on the phone  that sounded like coon.  Oh, right.  Oh.  You said in that tape, something's wrong with him.  He's checking me out.  Um, I don't know what his deal was.  So it's almost from the very beginning, you felt, are you saying on that 911 tape that  you felt threatened at that moment when you said that to the dispatch? 
[00:27:30]  No, not particularly.  What did you mean with, I don't know what his deal is, he's checking me out?  Well, the way he was coming back and, um, I was on the phone, but I was certain I could  see him saying something to me, um, and his demeanor, his body language was confrontational.  There was a controversy from early on, George, where there were some in the media that, quote, 
[00:28:00]  hired expert voice analysts and on certain networks, and then they ended up having to  recant and rescind their analysis, where they said these, quote, expletives get away with  this all the time.  Um, do you remember what it was that you said specifically on the tape?  Punks.  Punks?  P-U-N-K-U-N-D-C-U-N-K-O-N-D-O-N-D-E-S-O-N-D-O-N-T-E-E-T-E-T-E-T-E.  No.  And I can tell you that when the police played it for me in the station, it was clear as day. 
[00:28:30]  Really?  Punks and Coon don't sound similar at all.  Punks?  Um...  Punks.  Punks.  Punks.  I'm just throwing that in my head.  Punks.  Punks.  Yes.  Punk.  How does that turn out to sound like Kuhn?  Was it Kuhn?  Then it sounded like Colts, Colts.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Did we have that?  Can we find that, Sam?  Yeah, I want to hear the original clip now.  Yeah, Zimmerman says Kuhn.  Now that he's saying it was Punk.  Because Kuhn is what they thought it was, but it wasn't.  No.  Then they thought it was something else. 
[00:29:00]  God, they really fucking...  They wanted this to be a racial killing so fucking bad.  Yes, they did.  God, they behaved fucking repulsively.  Yes, they did.  The media really fucking behaved badly.  All right, here it is.  I don't know what I mean.  I'm going to have to find it.  How long is that clip?  Two minutes.  You find it, please.  Yeah.  So we can play that. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I mean, he sounds very...  It just sounds like a reasonable fellow during this interview.  Sam's got it.  Oh, here it is.  Punks.  Oh, fucking punks.  Fucking punks.  Wow, let me hear that.  Listen to that.  Wow.  That's punks.  Fucking punks.  Period.  Fucking punks.  That's punks.  Yeah.  It's amazing. 
[00:30:00]  So are people going to play this on the news today?  Probably.  Yeah, I wonder if they are going to play the explanation.  Probably not.  Because they had a lot of fun playing it when they thought it was Coons.  Why not play it now that it's been explained?  Right.  Yeah.  That should be everywhere today.  Everywhere.  Holy fuck.  I swear to you, when he said, I said punks, I'm sitting here like, no way did you say  punks.  I heard something that didn't sound like punks, certainly.  But it's clear as day now.  Play it again.  Hold on.  Yeah, go ahead.  Fucking punks. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Fucking punks.  Yeah.  How did they get Kuhn out of that?  Because they wanted to find something racist.  And when they said it sounds like, it's so, it's hard to tell what it is.  When someone tells you it's this, you go, oh yeah, it sounds like, because Kuhn, when  it said Kuhns, I was like, oh yeah, it does sound like Kuhn.  But now I don't hear Kuhn at all.  I don't either.  Was there a different version of that where the audio was a little, I don't know.  I think that's pretty much it.  That has always been the audio, and the news thinks that's Kuhn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man. 
[00:31:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Not only, so NBC edited the thing to go, they took out, just the way he goes, he's looking  suspicious, he's black.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the Kuhns, God, they wanted it to be a fucking.  They wanted it to be a racial thing.  He's white, Hispanic.  When have you ever heard anybody describe this as white, Hispanic?  Ever.  Right.  Never until this.  That clip should be everywhere today.  They want it.  George Zimmerman saying, I said punks.  Yeah.  And then you could listen again, and it sounds like punks.  It's punks.  Clear as day.  Even if you hate Hannity, and plenty of people hate Hannity, he has honestly, with this story, 
[00:31:30]  made absolute assholes out of the rest of the mainstream press.  Yes.  You hate him on everything else, fine, but on this story, he has made an asshole out  of every mainstream network.  And this is an important point in the story, and this is where you've got to understand  our news just stinks.  They will not go with this today.  No.  No.  Maybe one.  Maybe one. 
[00:32:00]  They honestly don't want to put the truth out there.  They want to make their own story, and they know enough people that watch their newscasts  are very uneducated on this case.  So they still, there are plenty of people that still think he said Kuhn, will always  think he said Kuhn.  There are people that think that the police told him not to follow.  There are people that, and will never think any different.  Right.  And then when he gets acquitted, they're going to be fucking freaking out because they don't  know the facts.  Unbelievable. 
[00:32:30]  I'm going to watch Wolf Blitzer today.  And the situation?  Yeah, because he's in the situation room, and this is a situation.  This is a situation.  It certainly is.  This is an absolute situation.  I want to see what he does with this.  I'm sure he'll play this as much as he played the other one, all right?  Yeah.  We moved on from your light issue a little too quickly, Ant.  You said you don't like the dark, right?  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of sitting in the dark.  How about dancing in the dark?  I could do that.  Jason from CT on Twitter writes, he's not afraid of the dark, he's afraid of the darks. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my.  Hey, that's racist.  And then this lady who has a horrible Twitter name, I can't even help you out, sorry.  Anthony hates candles because of the ex-wife.  That could be.  She used to light them candles up.  When it was sexy time.  Oh, when she light them candles up for some of that sex.  Yuck.  So now we understand why you don't like candles.  That just brings back bad memories.  Yes.  Oh, bad memories. 
[00:33:30]  I'm missing out on playing Half-Life.  There are stories we tell on this show that I swear I could hear another hundred times.  Oh, I know.  And just quickly, when I used to drop you off and see those candles in the window, and you're just pure disgust.  Oh, God.  And then one time you actually told me, could you please go around the block once?  Just go around the block.  I gotta psych myself up for this.  Fucking poor Gordon Freeman's gonna have to sit there for another few levels while I take care of business. 
[00:34:00]  While I fake an orgasm so I don't fucking cum in her and have a kid.  Do you know how great that is that you used to fake cumming in your wife?  Yeah.  Oh.  Would you make the cum face?  Oh.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Then you just go jack it off later?  Then I fucking lay seed in the bottom of the toilet.  Was that the part where you said it's fucking cold?  That's what it sounded like, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Fucking cold.  Is that the same part of the clip?  Okay.  Just making sure.  Because someone pointed that out, and I just wanted to make sure.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  You want more of this Zimmerman?  Oh, yeah.  We can keep going back to the X, Y.  Yeah, yeah.  It's one of my favorite subjects.  Jesus.  George says Trayvon was not running, and he was not pursuing him.  You said, and then we get to the issue where you said on the 911 call that he's running.  You said that to the dispatch.  Is there any chance in retrospect, as you look back on that night and what happened, and the nation obviously is paying a lot of attention to this. 
[00:35:00]  Yes, sir.  Trying to maybe get into the mindset, because we also have learned that Trayvon was speaking with his girlfriend supposedly at the time, that maybe he was afraid of you, didn't know who you were.  No.  You don't think that?  Why do you think that he was running then?  Maybe I said running, but he was more.  You said he was running.  Yes.  It was like skipping, going away quickly. 
[00:35:30]  But he wasn't running out of fear.  You could tell the difference?  He wasn't running.  So he wasn't actually running?  No, sir.  Okay, because that's what you said to the dispatcher as you thought he was running.  Let me ask you this.  At that point, we can hear the unbuckling of the seatbelt, hear you opening the car door.  And the dispatcher asked you at that point, and this became a very key moment that everyone in the media focused on.  And the dispatcher asked you, are you following him? 
[00:36:00]  And you said yes.  Explain that.  I meant that I was going in the same direction as him, to keep an eye on him so that I could tell the police where he was going.  I didn't mean that I was actually pursuing him.  So this moment where some had suggested you were out of breath on that tape, you were yourself without running?  No, sir.  Well, Hannity is very focused.  Oh, yeah.  He's doing a very good job.  Yeah, Hannity did a great job.  He did, but I'm going to tell you, Zimmerman is not as convincing to me. 
[00:36:30]  No?  No, because I think what he's doing is being careful about how he answers.  He has to be.  Now this is all evidence for the trial.  It's all admissible.  But he's saying things like, because Hannity called him on it, too.  He goes, well, you said he was running.  Well, I meant he was skipping away.  I buy more in the moment that the guy was moving away from him quickly rather than skipping away. 
[00:37:00]  I don't believe that he didn't know the other guy might have been afraid.  I think he's actually answering for legal reasons.  Like, if you acknowledge, like when he goes, did you feel threatened when you first got out of the car when he was staring at you?  Legally, if the answer is yes, and you still pursue, that may remove your stand, your ground.  I don't know what that is, but I think there's a little bit of bullshit there.  Even though I still don't think that he actually cold-bloodly murdered the guy, I think there's a little bit of bullshit there. 
[00:37:30]  But how about this?  Now, you can honestly tell when someone is running out of fear of you, and someone bolts running because they're afraid of you following them.  And when someone's taking off, perhaps not running at full speed, but I know what he's talking about, this little skip move, this little just step up your speed from walking thing.  When they want to get away from you, based on not wanting you to follow them anymore, because they just don't want you watching them. 
[00:38:00]  Not out of fear, but out of, you know, hey, motherfucker, I don't want you watching what I'm doing, and taking off in that direction.  You can tell the difference.  I don't think Trayvon took off running and kept running away, because, first of all, Zimmerman didn't follow him in a run.  And if Trayvon ran away out of fear and kept running, this never would have happened. 
[00:38:30]  He, at some point, circled back and punched Zimmerman in the face.  That's what Zimmerman is saying, and that's what the evidence shows.  I'm wondering, did he come up on...  Because what you're saying makes sense.  Did he come up on him, and he turns around and pops him?  Because to me, to get popped like that, without pulling your pistol out first, seems like you have to come around the corner.  He said he didn't see him.  He said he lost sight of him.  Didn't see where he was.  He had the phone.  He was walking toward a courtyard to get an exact address to tell the police. 
[00:39:00]  Because where his truck was, there was no way to really tell the police exactly where he was.  So he was going to get an address in a courtyard where he was, and at that point, Trayvon comes out of virtually nowhere and punches him right in the fucking nose and broke his nose.  But as far as Trayvon is concerned, he's walking, and this fucking guy is just eyeballing him.  I'm not saying he should have punched the guy, but, you know, because he is a shot, unarmed guy. 
[00:39:30]  He's literally just walking, and this fucking creepy dude is staring at him.  Did he know it was a neighborhood watch guy?  No.  So he sees this fucking guy staring at him and then following him.  He's probably like, if that's how it happens, like, what the fuck's this creepy guy following me for?  Well, I would think if I was walking in a neighborhood that I didn't live in and someone's following me,  I would first assume it's probably somebody in the neighborhood that is wondering what the fuck I'm doing there. 
[00:40:00]  I would find it, like, if I was in a neighborhood that I didn't live in, and I thought someone was following me,  and I didn't know they were a neighborhood watch, I would be fucking worried.  I'd be worried.  I would definitely be worried.  Or angry.  No, I don't know if I'd be angry.  I mean, there had been break-ins in that neighborhood, and he was doing what he felt he had to do to keep some of these places from being broken into.  I'm not 100% with Zerman, but I'm not, I don't. 
[00:40:30]  I think the evidence points to an acquittal, though.  I think you're right.  Whether you believe him or not, or that, I think there's enough there.  There's enough evidence here, and he's credible enough, and he passed a lie detector test,  and the evidence taken at the time, and his injuries, and all this stuff put together,  there's enough there to not convict him of second-degree murder.  I think you're right, and I do believe that he got punched, and I do believe that his head was split. 
[00:41:00]  Like, everything they've tried to disprove, I think, actually did happen.  I believe his, the violent, like, the way, I think Trayvon probably popped him.  Yes.  And I think that he really didn't intend on murdering the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think he did either.  There's just something about this lead-up to the actual events that's annoying me,  because I think he's answering only to protect himself legally,  and he's fucking dancing around the real, what he knew was going on.  There's something there that I'm not buying. 
[00:41:30]  Wow, amazing.  He's using the media to try to get his point across instead of just being crucified in it for months.  And if Trayvon was alive, he would be doing the same thing.  Yeah.  That's why you've got to bring this to the court.  There's just something about him that's bugging me in his answers.  Well, let's continue.  George says he didn't follow Trayvon after the 911 call.  What did you do from that minute forward when the dispatch said,  we don't need you to follow him?  What did you do next?  I walked across the sidewalk onto my street, Retreat View Circle, 
[00:42:00]  where I thought I would meet a police officer that I had called.  So you did not continue to follow him at that point?  No, sir.  How long was it, George, after that, that you saw Trayvon again?  Because you said you stopped, that you did not continue pursuing him.  When did you next see Trayvon Martin?  Less than 30 seconds.  Okay.  And so at that point, Trayvon is, all of a sudden you turned around and there he was. 
[00:42:30]  Yes, sir.  What happened next?  He asked me what my problem was.  Expletive problem.  Yes, sir.  And I was wearing a rain jacket and I put my cell phone in my jacket pocket as opposed to my jeans pocket where I normally keep it.  And I immediately went to grab my phone to this time call 911 instead of the non-emergency. 
[00:43:00]  And when I reached into my pants pocket, because that's where I keep it out of habit, it wasn't there.  And I was shocked.  I looked up and he punched me and broke my nose.  One shot.  Yes, sir.  So he said to you, you have expletive, you have a problem.  Those are the exact words you used.  You remember it?  Do you have a problem?  What's your problem?  What's your problem?  And you said to him, I don't have a problem. 
[00:43:30]  Yes, sir.  You reached for your phone.  I reached for, as I was saying, no, I don't have a problem.  And at that point, you just got hit?  He was already within arm's length from me.  Hmm.  See, uh-oh.  This is the hard part.  Uh-oh.  Here's the hard part for that.  That's a sticky point.  Very sticky point.  I looked up and he hit me.  Like, literally, you're following this guy who you're suspicious of, or you stop following him.  He reappears, and you look down, because you forget where you put your phone, instead of reaching for a pistol, which you have? 
[00:44:00]  Mm-hmm.  Who in their right mind, in that situation, where, regardless of who you are, there's a conflict between two men in a dark room.  Yeah.  You're aware and afraid.  Who the fuck is going to look down to dial 911 as this, you don't know, criminal or angry black dude is coming towards you.  You're going to reach for your pistol.  So that's the, this right here is the pivotal moment of this case. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Uh, did he go to reach for his gun, Trayvon sees that, and punches him in the face out of fear that this guy's pulling a gun on him?  Yeah.  Um, or did it happen like Zimmerman says?  Now, this, right here is the moment.  Here's the deal, though, that's going to be, uh, in the trial.  There's no witness to this, except for George Zimmerman.  And except for the physical evidence that's there, which shows that Zimmerman is beat up. 
[00:45:00]  It shows that Trayvon was shot at very close range after Zimmerman was beat up, obviously.  Right.  Um, and that's what, that's what they're going to have to work on.  Not a speculation that Trayvon might have thought he was going for the gun.  That's a maybe.  You gotta go with the evidence.  I honestly think Zimmerman's walking.  Now, that's very sticky.  Yeah, but I just, I simply, listening to that, don't believe him. 
[00:45:30]  Like, if he had said, in this, like, just right there, legally or not, whatever the legality of it is, if he had said he was approaching me, and I said to him, look, I'm armed, and he charged me, and I read, that I would believe.  Because that's what I think most people would do in that situation.  Nobody, in an honest situation, or again, most people, you're going to reach for a fucking phone to dial 911 because the guy's approaching you when you have a pistol? 
[00:46:00]  Who's going to reach for their cell phone?  Oh, nerds, it's not in my pocket.  Say!  Black fist in my face.  Oh, thank golly, I have a gun.  Oh, nerds.  Come on, stop.  All right, George talks about Trayvon seeing his gun and George calling out for help.  When did he first see your gun?  After we were on the ground, I shimmied with him on top of me, and it made my jacket rise up, and he being on top of me saw it on my right side. 
[00:46:30]  What happened after that?  I felt him take, he had, after he couldn't hit my head on the concrete anymore, he started to try to suffocate me.  And I continued to take, push his hands off of my mouth and my nose, particularly because it was excruciating, having a broken nose and him putting his weight on it. 
[00:47:00]  And that's the point in time when he started telling me to shut up, shut up, shut up.  Why did he tell you to shut up?  I don't know.  We heard the screams on the one recording from a neighbor that was calling the police, and there's been some dispute whose voice that is.  Was that your voice screaming, or was that Trayvon Martin's voice screaming?  That was my voice.  Absolutely.  That was your voice?  Yes, sir.  And the police even said at one time they heard 14 screams.  You were screaming that loud?  Yes, sir. 
[00:47:30]  They'll be able to prove whose voice it is in court.  I don't know.  It's on the back of a tape.  That's always been another point that is, who knows, but, yeah.  I don't believe that's the first time Trayvon saw his gun as he was being attacked and it shimmied up.  You're on a dark street and the guy's fucking pounding you.  I don't believe that he looks down if he's on top of you beating you.  I find it hard to, I mean, none of us have been in a fight in years, but you don't look down at a guy's waist when you're punching him in the face.  And Trayvon was strangling him? 
[00:48:00]  Is there marks that prove this?  Or smothering him, you're saying, hands over the face.  Smothering him over his face.  Didn't he say he had him around his neck at one point?  No, I think he said he was covering his mouth and his nose.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Well, how about we do this?  We take a break.  And when we get back, George talks about shooting Trayvon.  George.  This would be a good place to stop for the moment.  I simply am having trouble believing some of this.  It's the Sean Hannity interview with George Zimmerman.  Hannity did a good job.  I thought he was thorough.  He did.  He was thorough. 
[00:48:30]  He didn't come off as biased or anything.  He's asking him all the questions and calling him out on a lot of stuff.  I think anyone would stretch the truth, though, Jimmy, you know.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I don't believe he should be acquitted.  I mean, convicted of second-degree murder at all.  But I do think he acted more irresponsibly, and I think that I just don't buy that Trayvon  Martin, because you have to remember, this guy really was just going to get Skittles. 
[00:49:00]  Like, he wasn't there doing anything wrong.  He really was just fucking going to get something from the story.  He had them.  He actually had the stuff.  And he was just going back to watch the All-Star game.  And, you know, it's like, I just don't...  I'm not saying that, you know, it's not tragic.  It's not that mistakes weren't made.  Maybe cases of mistaken identity, shit like that.  But, you know, if George Zimmerman felt his life was being threatened at the time, which 
[00:49:30]  evidence shows that could very well be, regardless of what the actual truth of the matter is,  unfortunately, you know, he's going to be acquitted.  I don't think...  There's no way second-degree murder sticks on this motherfucker.  It doesn't happen.  No fucking way.  These prosecutors went too far, and they're going to pay for it by losing this case.  And they're going to try to plea him down to, what, manslaughter or something?  And he won't take a plea?  Maybe.  I don't think he'll take a plea. 
[00:50:00]  I think he's got this fucking knocked.  I think he'll be fine.  All right.  We'll continue with the audio in just a bit.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Got the British Open on.  I see that.  Oh, someone just sunk one.  Who was that?  I don't know.  That was a long putt.  Pretty long fucking putt.  Holy shit.  Who the hell was that? 
[00:50:30]  I think that's Graham McDonald.  I believe.  That's Thomas Aiken.  Huh?  Oh, wow.  I got that one wrong.  He should put some ice on it if he's aching.  Bubble bogey.  Adam Scott leads the British Open.  Minus five.  Tiger Woods, minus four.  And then Paul Lowry at minus three.  And Zach Johnson at minus three.  And Bubba Watson at minus three.  And then it goes on from there, I guess.  But Tiger Woods is off to a pretty good start so far. 
[00:51:00]  And Rich Voss' pick, John Daly, is already plus two.  Ridiculous.  Yeah, that was just a dumb pick, Rich.  Well, if anybody's going to do something dumb.  He doesn't like when you do that.  What?  Rich Obamacare Voss.  He's already upset that you didn't defend him.  And now you're for a third day in a row.  I'm going to defend that.  Why would you defend that?  It was hilarious.  He thought you'd be like, oh, it's my pal.  Don't make fun of my pal on your radio show.  Not the biggest fan of Glenn Beck, but funny is funny, man.  They nailed that one. 
[00:51:30]  I love that.  They nailed that one.  You're not a fan of anything Glenn Beck does, except when he makes fun of Voss.  No, I mean, fair is fair.  That was just funny.  Yeah.  That was just funny.  Happy birthday, Jim Norton.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Now, I want to say this really quickly.  Every day is Jim Norton's birthday, but today is actually his birthday.  It's really his birthday.  So I don't want people to be like, ah, yeah, whatever.  It's the dumb, you know, birthday bit they do every day.  Not even shitting you.  I want to acknowledge that it's Jim Norton's actual birthday. 
[00:52:00]  And I know that there's a big surprise that everybody's been planning, so whatever you want to spring it on me.  Let me unzip.  I said surprise.  Not daily occurrence.  Yeah, that's old hat to me.  What are you going to do?  Stick it in my mouth, asshole, ears, and nose?  Old hat.  Tony.  Tony.  Tony, Tony, Boboni.  Suck on my bologna.  Pepperoni.  Oh, pepperoni.  I changed the words around. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, then you say, leave me aloni.  Tony.  I hate that song.  I used to cry when it came on.  I turned into old pissy eyes.  It's a goddamn song.  Jesus Christ.  Would he get annoyed when you'd cry?  Oh, would he get annoyed when I cried?  We were going through flushing ones, coming home from a party at one of his relatives' house.  So, of course, he was hammered.  Him and mom are yelling and arguing.  And then the radiator just fucking unloaded. 
[00:53:00]  Steam comes out.  And we kind of just limped over to the side of the road.  And he starts getting out.  And I just lost it.  Why?  Why are you crying in that situation?  So, I was just scared.  You weren't even driving.  The road was dark.  And it was like, and the steam was making noise.  And that just scared you as a little kid?  How old were you?  I was probably six.  All right.  Well, six.  You cried.  But he got, yeah.  But, oh, man. 
[00:53:30]  Dad was just like.  But he wouldn't allow.  Shut him the fuck up.  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because he had it.  He didn't want to deal with the radiator going.  And mom bitching at him the whole drive because he's hammered driving.  And he'd just go, Roe, shut him the fuck up.  It's like, oh, Joey, shut up.  Stop it.  He's upset.  Can I ask you something?  Yeah.  Did he like your brother better?  No, he actually liked me better.  But he seemed to really yell at you a lot more.  Yeah.  You know what?  Maybe early on when I was a kid, he was annoyed with me, you know, being pissy-eyed. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  But later on, I think me and him had a lot more in common than him and Joe did.  You know, I kind of liked hanging out with him and having fun riding horses and shit.  And Joe just, you know, it was kind of like his own guy thing.  All right.  Yeah, so it was kind of like that.  And I think deep down, I was a little bit more like him, you know.  I think deep down, my dad probably wanted to be pissy-eyed and shit, you know.  Did you cry more or less when they started fighting with each other? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, more.  Oh, I fucking, I got a stomachache!  Just anything to make him stop fighting.  Nah.  Don't cry ever?  Joe was the rock.  Yeah, Dawn was just dumb.  She was just that deer caught in headlights when they would fight.  She's just, I don't know.  Everything's good.  And I'm like, stop.  Was she more like denying everything?  Trying to go through life?  Like, ah, Dawn.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just a little misunderstanding.  Get in your room! 
[00:55:00]  I'd come out like, ah, I got a stomachache!  No, you don't!  Get in your room!  So you cried the most.  Yeah, I was going to cry, baby.  Dawn was in denial, and I would bet brother Joe just kind of rolled his eyes like that.  Joe just got angry.  Get this fucking over with and separate already.  Joe was like the guy that was wise beyond his years.  Like, whenever they would leave the apartment, Joe would make out with the babysitter and fucking just drink the booze in the house.  He would, I swear, at fucking probably nine years old, Joe was plying the fucking babysitters with booze from the liquor cabinet and then making out with them. 
[00:55:30]  How do you even figure that out at nine?  I don't know.  I was scared shitless of booze and broads.  Somebody gives you booze and kisses you in your nine.  That's how you figure it out.  Oh, poor Joe.  Oh, really?  Molestation?  Joe was...  Molestation.  Joe ruled when it came to fucking wheeling out with the babysitters.  Right.  Because they were probably 14, 15 at the time, the babysitters. 
[00:56:00]  And he was nine.  And he was nine making out with the fucking babysitters.  And then they would fucking have parties at the house.  This is like, you know, very early in the 70s.  And these hippies would come over the house and fucking play guitars and bongos and drink and, you know.  And then they would clear out.  We never ratted them out, though.  Never ratted out the babysitters.  How would you rat them out?  It was kind of fun.  I would never rat that shit out.  You know, that's just cool shit.  Jimmy, you having a tuna fish sandwich? 
[00:56:30]  Mm-hmm.  See, um...  That is good, right?  On toast?  Amazing.  Fucking excellent.  Nope, that's why I'm bringing it up.  What?  These guys have never tried tuna fish with grapes.  And I'm standing by this.  You're insane.  I'm not the only one.  Celery?  Great.  Celery, good.  You put the celery in there, too.  Nah, lettuce is a waste of time.  Nah, you put some lettuce on there.  And I love a little lettuce on my...  No one loves lettuce.  Everyone makes believe they love lettuce.  Lettuce stinks.  Not alone, but on a sandwich?  Lettuce stinks.  I don't mind a crispy piece of lettuce on a tuna fish sandwich. 
[00:57:00]  But if it wasn't there, you wouldn't care, either.  Lettuce isn't a standalone leaf.  Can you guys at least try tuna fish, celery, and some grapes?  I'm not putting grapes in my fish.  Not a lot of grapes.  Not a lot of grapes.  No!  Some people break down the grapes, so every bite has a little grape.  I hope he eats like he's pregnant.  Never.  I know I'm not the only one.  Come on.  No.  Where are my tuna fish grape people? 
[00:57:30]  I will not eat grapes.  What about a little...  That's like that bacon sundae.  No meat on my fucking ice cream.  No fucking fruit on my fish.  It was good.  Nah, you put a little sweetness into your tuna fish.  Just a little bit.  It brings everything together nicely.  Maybe a little squeeze of lemon on there, but not...  Come on, lemon.  Not fucking...  Come on, lemon.  Lemon.  Come on.  That's good.  Lemon is a waste of time, too.  Grapes.  What do you put lemon on?  Clams, maybe?  And what do you do?  I love lemon.  Do you cut the grapes up, or are you putting the whole grapes in? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, you cut them up.  Maybe you put them into like quarters.  Cut it in half, and then cut it again.  Too sweet.  Too sweet.  Well, it depends how sweet you want your tuna fish.  Don't want it.  I'm just saying a little...  Don't want it in there.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  I know I'm not alone on this.  My chick makes chicken salad with grapes.  There you go.  I just pick them out.  Oh.  There you go.  You don't want that in there.  Maybe it's a girl thing.  I don't like the grape thing.  I'm telling you.  No.  But you've never tried it. 
[00:58:30]  No, but I could tell.  But you've got to try it to tell.  I'm mentally putting it together.  You are.  In my head, and I could taste it.  And no.  Ugh.  No.  Ew.  See, I got your back, Ope, on the grape thing.  I'm telling you.  No.  Just try it.  Jimmy, will you try it for your birthday?  I don't like apples and stuff, either.  Oh, look.  Amanda goes, I'm with you.  It's like the Waldorf chicken salad with nuts and cranberries.  Oh, I hate nuts in anything.  I don't mind nuts and cranberries together with a little cheese. 
[00:59:00]  The Waldorf.  Before I even finish this sentence, the dick-sucking reference was made.  Of course.  That was good.  How about tuna and pickles?  That's good.  No, no.  I don't like pickles on anything.  They're too overpowering.  You don't have a pickle with a sandwich?  Nope.  I love a fucking...  What's wrong with you?  Too overpowering.  You just want a plain tuna fish sandwich.  I'll eat a pickle after the sandwich. 
[00:59:30]  No, you eat it at the same time.  No.  You take a bite and then you...  Overpowering.  And then you...  No.  Too powerful.  How about this?  A fucking nice Carnegie Deli sandwich with fucking...  Some of their half-sour pickles.  Rule.  Yeah?  Oh.  I don't know about that.  I love a good Carnegie Deli sandwich with a fucking pickle.  Grapes and tuna is fucking delicious.  You gotta use green grapes.  Fruit and meals is gay.  There you go.  You assholes.  No, I'm not feeling that whole grape-y thing. 
[01:00:00]  But you don't even try it.  No, and I won't.  I won't.  I know what I want.  You just know.  I know.  All right.  I could figure that taste out.  All right.  Oh, God.  Fair enough.  Sam.  Sam's got a couple of well...  Very in-shape gentlemen.  One resting his head on the other one's leg as he's fed strawberry.  I just heard people eating fruit.  Yes.  Tuna and jam rocks.  Now, that's weird.  No, stop it.  That's just dumb.  That's crazy. 
[01:00:30]  Now we're all on the same page.  That's just stupid.  With marshmallow fluff and salmon.  I never was a peanut butter and fluff guy.  No.  That was the dumbest thing to me.  Yeah.  Because I liked the jelly with the peanut butter.  I just like fluff.  Knowing you can have jelly, why would you go fluff and peanut butter?  That made your mouth incredibly dry.  I liked just fluff on bread.  I would just scoop out the fluff.  That, too.  And it's got to be new fluff.  Old fluff just turns into, like, fucking napalm.  Oh, where it's all crystalline shit.  It's just goopy.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Yay.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  There's a happy birthday.  Jim Norton made a happy birthday list.  On Ivus.  Thank you.  With Lisa Lampanelli.  Nice.  And George who?  Lisa's 51?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know.  She was a few years older.  I didn't know she was all that.  She's only 51.  Oh, Jimmy.  She does.  You share a birthday with Lisa Lampanelli.  I do, yeah.  Cool.  She lost a lot of weight recently.  Yeah, yeah.  She, what?  She got the stomach thing.  The hiv?  I think she got the stomach thing. 
[01:01:30]  Let's get back to George Zimmerman.  So, we're talking about the interview we did with Sean Hannity last night from a hotel  room somewhere in Florida.  And now we're up to the point where George talks about shooting Trayvon.  All right.  Do you remember when you yourself reached for your weapon?  Do you remember that moment?  Yes, sir.  Tell us about that.  At that point, I realized that it wasn't my gun. 
[01:02:00]  It wasn't his gun.  It was the gun.  Did he say anything?  Because you said he was talking a lot about the gun.  Did he say he noticed the gun?  He said, you're going to die tonight.  And took one hand off of my mouth.  And I felt it going down my chest towards my belt and my holster.  Ooh, sexy.  And that's when I didn't have any more time.  Do you think you acted more out of a conscious thought? 
[01:02:30]  I mean, I know these events happen very quickly.  Do you remember consciously thinking, I've got to grab my gun?  Or did you just do it?  Was there a conscious thought that went through your head that you thought you were going to  die and that you had to take this, you had to get your weapon and fire?  I'd love to give you an answer.  You don't know.  It just happened so quickly.  I simply do not believe him.  Yeah, that's rough.  Again, I don't think he's a second-degree murderer. 
[01:03:00]  I really don't.  I do not believe that Trayvon Martin said to him, you're going to die tonight.  Even if he passed a law detective test, I believe that that is way too perfect legally.  For Trayvon to have said, you're going to die tonight and reach down towards his gun, I don't believe him.  It sounds like he's in a posturing for the trial here.  Of course, I would too.  Yeah, yeah, he's trying to save his own ass. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, having called the police beforehand, I doubt he was out to shoot somebody, you know?  I mean, he called the police.  They were on their way.  He wanted the police to show up before any confrontation.  But now, you know, yeah, you got a guy, all of a sudden he's being confronted by somebody.  I do think Trayvon knew he had that gun before he pulled the gun out.  I do think, now, I do think he knew he had the gun. 
[01:04:00]  Or was he just getting his ass kicked and panicked?  Like, again, I would too if I had a gun and Trayvon or anybody was beating me up, I'd pull it out.  Right.  And maybe he just panicked and shot him because he was getting his ass kicked.  You're going to go to the maximum that you can possibly go to.  And if you have the gun, that's what you're going to do if you're getting your ass handed to you.  I simply do not believe that Trayvon Martin said to him, you're going to die tonight.  If circumstances had been different, I just don't buy it. 
[01:04:30]  It just doesn't seem real to me that everything he's saying is too perfect legally.  Yeah.  And I just don't buy it.  Well, let's continue.  George talks about fearing for his life now.  There was a bounty put on your head by the new Black Panther Party, wanted dead or alive.  Yes, sir.  Nobody's been arrested.  Yes, sir.  Do you feel your life is in jeopardy? 
[01:05:00]  Yes, sir.  By the Black Panther Party?  Amongst others, yes, sir.  And you've had multiple death threats?  Yes, sir.  You know, look at what happened in this case because it became so public.  Spike Lee is tweeting out what he thinks is your home address.  The Reverend Al Sharpton and NBC News, you know, tries to use this case to bring up the issue  of racial profiling.  What do you say to Spike Lee?  He didn't know the facts of the case.  They hadn't been revealed. 
[01:05:30]  What do you say to Al Sharpton and those that rushed to judgment?  What do you think their motives were?  I can't guess to what their motives are.  I would just ask for an apology.  I mean, if I did something that was wrong, I would apologize.  This is going to come back to haunt him, by the way.  Really?  Why?  Because he does, during this interview, apologize to the family.  Now, a prosecuting attorney can make it sound like, hey, you apologized, and then later 
[01:06:00]  on in the same interview, you say, if I did something wrong, I would apologize.  You feel you did something wrong here?  They will do that.  You're right.  They will twist that.  They will use it.  And his explanation will be, yeah, maybe I said that wrong.  I was saying, I'm sorry that your son is gone, and that it happened, but I'm not sorry specifically  about the credit card.  But the jury will hear that.  Yeah, they will.  Yeah.  And they will twist it.  You're right.  Yeah.  George talks about being supported in prison. 
[01:06:30]  The prison population was very aware of your case being so high profile.  Did they treat you differently?  The inmates?  The inmates.  Yeah.  Yes.  In what way?  Um, I believe that a lot of them personally know that sometimes the media doesn't portray  things correctly.  There was one instance when I was in the rec yard by myself, and in a window, a few inmates 
[01:07:00]  got together and just made a sign of strength to me.  Yeah, but what color were they?  Exactly.  Isn't that important?  I'd like to say the sisters didn't get to George Zimmerman.  Hannity should ask, what color were they?  Yeah, I'm sure it was the white supremacists.  Right.  Well, the guys are fucking swastikas on their shoulders.  No one hangs out with their, their people in prison.  Yeah, yeah.  So which, which group was it?  Exactly. 
[01:07:30]  I don't think it was the black guys.  Maybe the Hispanic guys.  I don't know.  I think it's important here.  I don't know if Sean, Sean didn't ask.  No, no, no, no, no.  George talks about not being white.  The narrative it seems they want to make about this case is that, and you could read the articles if you haven't already.  It's a white guy that killed an unarmed black youth holding Skittles and an iced tea.  What do you say to that? 
[01:08:00]  Again, I appreciate you not rushing to judgment.  I think that people assumed I was white because of my last name.  My father is Caucasian.  My mother is Hispanic.  But English was my second language, believe it or not.  My grandmother and my mother raised me.  My dad was in the army, and he wasn't home for a lot of my infancy.  So I consider myself, first of all, an American, but a Hispanic American.  And I don't know. 
[01:08:30]  I don't think it's fair that they rushed to judgment to assume that.  This guy, he's a smart guy.  Yeah, but he's also.  He knows how to fucking sell himself because he's distancing himself away from the whole white thing.  Because he knows that will help him.  Because Hannity's using this as an opportunity to motherfuck the rest of the media.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And he's right.  Again, hate him if you want.  But the media just is fucking disgusting.  I think Hannity did a great job there.  He did do a great job, man. 
[01:09:00]  We should get him on the phone.  He called him out.  Let's get his feelings on the whole interview.  His feelings.  Did we contact Hannity about this?  I did send an email to him.  You did?  We started doing this.  I haven't heard back from him yet.  Yeah, we'd love to get him on for a few minutes.  He doesn't actually have any idea who Eric is.  E-Rock likes to think he does.  He does, yeah.  He doesn't know you.  It was the greatest thing ever.  I don't know if I've ever told you, Jim.  I think I've, maybe I've said it on the air before, but when you guys did the Imus thing.  Oh, yes.  I heard this.  You remember, right? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Because Eric, for years, had been saying how he knows Hannity and, you know, that's our  connection to Hannity.  Hannity, we were sitting in the Hard Rock dressing room, and Hannity, I think it was  me, Eric, and I don't remember who else from the show was there, but he points to both  of us and he goes, and which one of you is the one that emails me?  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, no.  E-Rock.  Eric goes, that's me.  And he goes, and your name is Eric?  Oh.  You really saw this go down?  E-Rock.  It was the greatest thing that ever happened. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, it did.  It so did.  It happened.  He didn't know you were.  It happened.  It totally happened.  Eric wants every radio guy to know him.  I'm willing to say it happened.  Yeah.  Scott Shannon.  Damn.  Scott Shannon know you?  Yeah, he knows me, but I don't know.  Oh, that's a fat kid there.  You're so awesome.  I fired him when I caught him eating my pudding.  Sex bagel.  Stop eating Scott Shannon's desserts.  He was eating my pudding, so I fired him.  While I was eating it.  He was scoping his little fat fingers to the other side of it. 
[01:10:30]  Eating my pudding.  If they continue making Batman movies, they've got to get Scott Shannon as a villain.  Yeah.  Big head.  Fucking big head.  That would be great.  Everyone's going to go see Batman?  I hear it's sold out already.  I'll probably try to go see a daytime show.  You had a chance.  You had two showings.  Why didn't you go?  What's wrong with you?  I've got things to do.  I'm not going to sit there.  You have nothing to do.  Yeah.  Wait.  I've got stuff going on.  I just want to say one thing about Batman, because I want to help people out. 
[01:11:00]  When you're watching the movie, please don't focus on that huge mole on Christian Bale's thing.  That's what I'm going to make people focus on.  Don't focus on it, because it'll be a much better movie if you could just ignore the fact  he's got a big mole between his nose and his right eye.  It's massive.  Batman has a beanbag chair on his face.  You don't understand a word I'm saying.  I'm talking through an air vent.  I sound like I'm hiding in a ductwork of your house.  It's difficult to understand me. 
[01:11:30]  What?  What, Bane?  I should be looking at a warthog in the woods right now.  I'm David Attenborough.  Sam, I'm just trying to help the people out.  I think if they know ahead of time that if they just ignore the mole, it's a much better  performance by Christian Bale.  How are they supposed to ignore the mole while consciously thinking about how they're not  supposed to be thinking about the mole?  No, I think if you bring it up like this, then they go, oh yeah, the mole thing.  Okay, yeah, I'm not supposed to focus on it.  You're not good with psychology.  I don't think it works that way. 
[01:12:00]  No, it's going to work out perfectly for these people, and they're going to enjoy themselves  that much more.  You just don't see it happening.  Yes, it will happen.  Okay.  Yes.  What race are you?  None of your business, Bane.  Can we take a break so we can get Florentine in here?  Sure.  Oh, man.  And also, we got Dice coming in today.  Hey, Dice is coming in.  Hey, we saw Dice in Vegas.  Yeah, he did, right?  You fucking asshole face.  It was great.  When he said asshole face, it was fantastic.  Throws someone out, calls him asshole face. 
[01:12:30]  He tells him to go into the back and stare at the wall.  Oh, and then he talks about woman sap.  Woman sap?  These women, they get that, what is it?  That woman sap?  It comes out of their belly button, or I don't know where.  He comes up with these premises.  They're just amazingly ridiculous.  Yes.  But he says it like, we all know that this is the way it happens.  He's playing Twister with a girl in a back alley by a dumpster. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, really?  That's one of his concepts.  It's a first date.  What else are you going to do?  Yeah, first date.  You know, a lot of people try to come up with that silly shit, but when Dice does it, it just works.  It was hilarious.  Who comes up with woman sap?  Woman sap.  You did not sap.  No, chip.  Now, come now.  Yeah, I called it goopy goop.  Goopy goop.  That's stupid.  Way worse.  All right, listen.  We break.  Florentine joins the show next.  Florentine married.  Why isn't he not on his honeymoon?  We will find out next. 
[01:13:30]  He went on a mini moon.  Is that what you did?  I went on a mini moon.  What's your full honeymoon?  August.  And where are you going?  Hawaii.  Hawaii.  Yeah.  Don't go in the water.  Why?  Sharks.  Oh, and I love it if he came back missing a left arm.  Oh, that would be good.  Yeah, we don't want you dead, but man, if you were missing half your arm, that would be hilarious.  That would be kind of cool.  It's just as embarrassing.  That would just be hilarious.  We all have to make believe we don't notice this.  I'd lose my wedding ring.  Oh.  You put it around your neck.  That's what the people do.  Steven Singer.  They put it on a necklace for you. 
[01:14:00]  Exactly.  Wedding ring.  You'd lose that.  Yeah.  To hook up another one.  Bought and then lost by a shark.  See?  Because he's fucking weaselly.  See?  See?  There are only a handful of online dating sites.  Where you can actually meet women who just want to bang.  The way I want to make Gotham go bang.  At the top of that list, CougarLife.com.

[01:16:00]  Say why it was voted the wildest dating service in America three years in a row.  That's the end of the raid, fatso.  I don't know. 
[01:16:30]  I don't know what you're doing wrong then.  I don't know.  For some reason I can't watch the video of me getting OP tweeted about me getting hit by 12 MMA guys.  I've been trying to watch it on my fucking iPhone and I can't watch it.  I thought maybe I needed to do my Wi-Fi.  It just will not play on my iPhone.  Oh, man.  I was working on that for a while.  I finally got it done.  It's called, yeah, Jimmy said the name of it.  It's Jim Norton versus 12 MMA fighters.  It's doing really well.  All the MMA sites are picking up on it. 
[01:17:00]  I want to thank everyone who's pushing that out for us and retweeting it.  But I think it came out great.  Yeah, I want to see it.  Did you see the end?  You haven't even seen the end part?  No.  Oh, fuck.  Can you just show Norton the end part?  Yeah, the montage.  The montage.  Montesh.  Montesh.  You can't skip that shit.  Do you put the ad up or they do?  It's a whole thing with YouTube, so I'll explain it off the air. 
[01:17:30]  You don't have to play the whole thing.  Oh, that was a delay thing.  John Jones.  DJ Penn.  DJ Penn.  Jimmy just out.  Give me an arm.  Tony Penn for the last chase.  The last chase.  I'm a soundie, mate.  Ready for tour.  Ador.  Wow.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, man.  Fucking Frankie Edgar.  Everyone punching you.  Jon Jones punching you.  Oh, shit.  That was a fucking rock.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That was fucking, uh, that was Uriah Faber.  I think he punched you to the heart.  Yeah, Uriah hit the heart.  Although Jon Jones punched you pretty hard, too.  Oh, that looks, wow.  Brock again, yeah.  Oh, I don't like the heel hook at all.  Wow.  Oh, that's, uh, fucking Frank Shamrock. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, fuck, you know what?  I didn't put him in the...  Frank Shamrock.  Fredo, there's, uh, Anderson Silva.  Kicking you.  The game maker.  This is what we should do.  Oh!  Uriah Faber.  Uh, Rashad Evans.  Oh, wow.  Graham Schultz.  Frank Edgar again.  Are we ready?  Yes, we are.  This is so sexy.  Gina Caron.  Caron, whatever.  She's beautiful.  Like a party favor. 
[01:19:00]  He didn't even like that.  Yes, he did!  And then Jon Jones holding the hold.  Yeah, a little too long.  He choked me good.  So much.  Fedor choked me.  And he kept...  He let me go and he kept doing it.  Yeah.  Because he's smiling.  Oh, God.  And then he just grabbed me again and did it again.  Did another hold.  Oh, boy.  There's Rashad in the fucking leather.  This one comes here.  Yeah, he's got everything all tied up.  A little, a little tight.  And Rashad.  And then I just push my head for it. 
[01:19:30]  Keeping the hand in like...  Now, do you do this when you're actually fighting?  That fucking hurts, man.  Wow.  Now I do.  Wow!  Fighting!  Wow!  That's good, dude.  That's hilarious.  Good job.  It's been a long time.  That's good, man.  Put it on the Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton versus 12 MMA fighters.  And thanks, everyone, retweeting it.  I think the MMA sites are on it, man.  Have I only gotten 12 guys to do that? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  I would have thought it was more.  No.  I think that's it.  I never got Liddell or Rampage, even though we've had those guys in.  Yeah, that was kind of before you started doing that stuff then.  Before you started doing that sick shit.  I double and triple checked because I was scared I was going to forget somebody.  But I think that's all of them.  Yeah, Silva was a good one, too.  I think it's all of them.  Huh?  Forrest, I never did anything with?  Forrest Griffin, we never did anything with?  I think I got them all.  Now you're going to make me fucking do an OCD thing and check again.  No, I think you're right.  Jim's here, by the way.  Jim Florentine, everyone.  Yes.  Who is now a married man. 
[01:20:30]  What do you think, Anthony?  Ah, good luck to you.  I sincerely mean that.  I like you.  I hope everything goes swimmingly for many, many years.  Can I jump in?  I think it's easier to get married when you're older, though, too.  Yeah, that's true.  You got married pretty young.  I didn't.  Considering.  30's young.  Nah, not for getting married.  That's like when people go like, oh, I've got to get married.  Yeah, 30 is young.  You were 30.  30's still young, man.  How long did it last?  Oh, boy.  It depends who you ask.  Well, how long was it good, or how long did it last? 
[01:21:00]  Last.  Well, it lasted much longer than it should have because I had a brand new career I was working  on, radio.  And that took up all my time that would normally have been spent in misery with the woman that  I shouldn't ever have been with.  So, nine years.  All right, so 30 to 30.  All right, so you hung on.  Yeah, but I think if you would have done it now, you know what I mean?  It would have been different.  He's a bigger piece of garbage now than he was then. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, I am despicable now.  Well, you're making up for lost time.  Oh, I certainly am.  Because he ran his life a little differently.  I'm about a piece of shit.  Yeah, but see, he could have done his piece of shit years from age 30 to 39, which I did,  basically.  I should have.  So then by the time you get in your 40s, you're like, all right, I'm done with that.  But he felt like he had to be married because he was turning 30.  Yeah.  And that's one of the reasons why he got married.  Yeah, I felt like that was my step to responsibility because I was always, you know, very irresponsible.  But you're a really smart guy. 
[01:22:00]  Why would you think that would work?  Oh, no.  Seriously, why?  Yeah, never go with that age thing.  You know, at this age, I got to do this.  I got to do that.  We've heard all the stories.  At 30, he gets married.  He cries on his wedding night because he knows it was the wrong decision.  But he still made the decision because he thought it was a way of growing up.  Like, oh, did I make a fucking boo-boo?  You cried on your wedding night?  I was sitting there like, it wasn't, it wasn't like, but it was tears of utter frustration  and despair, like as I'm laying there, pouring out of the corner of my eye, down, as I'm 
[01:22:30]  laying on my back, staring at the ceiling, thinking, what the fuck?  Yeah.  And your new wife probably thought you were happy.  That's why the tears were flowing.  Nah, she was passed out already.  Fucking hurt.  She was married previously to Jack Daniels.  A man named Jack Daniels.  Did you eat her ass on your wedding night?  No.  She ate mine for fucking the divorce.  Yeah, it was just...  Did she ever know that you cried on your wedding night because you knew it was a... 
[01:23:00]  I don't think so, no.  She probably knows now.  Maybe.  No prenup?  No, I was a tin knocker.  Oh, so you weren't even on the radio yet?  No, no.  It was just fucking knocking tin.  I was making $27.5 a year.  And, yeah.  I want a prenup, you know?  Hey, come on.  I'm getting my fucking good hammer out of this marriage.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're getting my tin snips.  He didn't even have a car, really, when he got married.  My left and my right.  He had a car on blocks when I met him. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, it was the old Dodge Ares.  He didn't even have a car when I met him.  I had a Dodge Ares K car.  A 1986 Dodge Ares K car.  That was my sister's that she gave to me.  And I had nothing.  I did not.  The proverbial pot to piss in, nor window to throw it out of.  I had nothing.  So prenup wasn't even a consideration.  And I don't know why I got married.  I don't know why.  I kind of got roped into it in the moment.  I was in the moment.  And she, like, immediately started the marriage thing. 
[01:24:00]  The second, like, we started really hooking up, she, like, wouldn't stop with the, you know,  would you ever consider marrying me?  Wait, how long are you into dating?  You never told.  Months.  You never told.  It's just a few months.  Yeah.  So how long did you date her before you married her?  Let me think.  I think it was probably six months.  Six months?  That's it?  All right.  I fucked up.  Jesus.  Come on, I fucked up.  Six months.  I fucked up, all right?  That's it.  Did you know her longer than that? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Was she, like, the hottest chick that you were with at that point?  No, no.  Not even?  No.  I could see, like, you know, you get one way out of your league, like a nine, and you're  a five, and you're like, five.  I'm not letting this one go.  No.  Was she amazing in bed?  She wasn't bad.  I'll give her that.  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  She gave me, like, a fucking great blowjob.  The fucking, like, the first time we hooked up.  It was fantastic.  Where were you when you get your blowjob?  In her room. 
[01:25:00]  She was renting a room in a house.  And I went over there to watch, like, Oprah or some shit with her.  That was always my little guise to leaving, cheating on my girlfriend to go fuck this one.  I had a girlfriend at the time that lived, like, fucking, we lived together.  It's, like, two blocks away.  You lived with a girl when you met your future wife.  Yeah, yeah.  And she knew.  And I went over there.  And she knew.  Yeah, she knew I had a girlfriend.  So then I went over there once, and it was like, oh, we had a couple of cocktails.  And before I knew it, you know, she's fucking haw, haw, haw. 
[01:25:30]  Whatever happened to the only girl?  You never brought this up before.  Oh, that was Carrie.  Is she still around?  She's the same one when I built that stun gun from stuff I got at Radio Shack, and I  wanted to see if it worked, so I hit her with it, and it worked.  You could have killed her.  Let's see.  You could have killed her.  I don't know.  Was she mad after, because you met this girl, and six months later, you guys were married?  Did you ever see her after that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  After that, and she was probably pissed.  She was none too happy, but she was one of those kind of just go along with whatever  the fuck happened thing kind of girls, you know? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Whatever happened to Carrie?  I don't know.  I don't know.  She's just kind of...  She's got to still be on Long Island somewhere, right?  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Some people just can't leave Long Island.  Does she realize how close she was from the lottery?  The lottery!  Does she realize?  I know.  She was one away.  One lousy girl.  One away.  That's like when the fucking Wheel of Fortune is going around.  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Oh, you just missed. 
[01:26:30]  Were you considering marrying her?  No.  Why?  I wasn't considering marrying...  Because I was dead set against marriage.  But what...  Was Carrie hotter?  No.  Did you have a better personality?  I really was exclusive to Long Island white fucking trash.  So the ex was better, looking back.  Yeah.  At the time.  At the time.  At the time.  At the time, the ex-wife was better.  So that was a step up for you?  Yeah.  Okay.  The ex-wife had a pretty decent body on her when I first met her and shit.  She was... 
[01:27:00]  She worked at a bar.  She was a bartender.  And all the fucking Long Island construction workers, scum, were always, you know, gawking  and stuff.  She had great tits on her and nice ass in those fucking jeans and shit.  Yeah.  It was good.  Yeah.  When you're a bar fly and you can get the bartender, that's fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's strong.  That's called on the big one, right?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That was a biggie.  It was a biggie.  Because everybody fucking wants to fuck her.  As soon as she walks away, everybody's jacking on her ass.  Like, I'm fucking that.  Yeah.  That's the fucking Lily Wright.  That was a cool...  That's a big score for you.  I was like big man on campus there in Greenlawn.  Let me tell you. 
[01:27:30]  I was the king of Greenlawn for that one.  Wow.  And you guys had the reception in that bar?  It was...  No, it wasn't that bar.  It was the bar my mom was working at, which was later turned into a strip club.  Hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Had the whole fucking shindig at that.  I love your wedding story.  Oh.  They're the greatest.  His engagement ring story is even better, though.  And then...  Oh, and then my dad showed up for the wedding.  He did?  Yeah.  He showed up.  He came into the bar.  And at this time, it was like the first time my mom and dad had been in the same room together. 
[01:28:00]  For how long?  It had to be years.  About five, six years?  Longer than that.  Longer than that.  Wow.  Yeah, maybe ten years.  And you were still a little pissy eyes later that night.  See what happened?  Actually, thank God he didn't see me.  Son of a bitch.  Knock it off.  Be a man, faggot.  And then he...  My mom was with Sal at the time, you know?  I think they had gotten married.  Yeah.  They had, like, just gotten married.  And my dad, like, tied one on and just started singing second-hand rose in the bar. 
[01:28:30]  Saying that rose, my mom rose, was second-hand rose because...  Oh, my God.  ...because he had banged her prior.  So he's just singing that at the bar?  It's like drinking, just second-hand rose, second...  Son of a bitch.  Was Sal annoyed?  Nah.  Sal was a, you know, happy-go-lucky guy.  Did they get along or no, Sal and your dad?  Eh, you know, they just kind of cordially spoke to each other, but it wasn't really... 
[01:29:00]  Was that the last time your parents were together?  Yeah.  That was it?  That was probably it.  Yeah, after that he went back to California and never returned.  I think he had to leave the city pretty quick.  He had to go in and out.  I think there were still some wants and warrants.  Was that the last time you saw him?  That he had to...  No, no, I had gone out to California after that.  Yeah, yeah.  We all went out.  Yeah, we fucking went out a few times after that.  Yeah, it was fun.  But, let me think. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, I...  All right, so I married her, and it just fell apart within...  How many years?  I guess right when I started radio, I really started realizing, like, uh-oh.  Because then, that's when the hotties started coming around.  Oh, and I made you realize some shit, huh?  The Kahlua Girls at some fucking Club Cadillac.  Fuck.  But you probably...  So you probably didn't get out of your system.  That's why.  No, I was always a long-term relation guy.  You were?  Long-term relationship guy.  What, Florentine's panicking? 
[01:30:00]  No, I'm not panicking.  What are you doing over there?  I'm saying...  It's just funny, Florentine picking out these little...  It just makes me laugh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because he definitely didn't.  He didn't put up some good numbers.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, so...  He really didn't.  And then...  You put up good numbers.  Yeah, and he needed to.  And then when you got back out there, and all of a sudden, you know, these chicks were  all over you.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, going to the bar at, you know, fucking 505 when you get off at work at five, you're  not going to get that much box.  No.  He came out of...  I mean, he did okay, but then all of a sudden you get on the radio, and then all these girls  are coming by, and you're doing these live remotes. 
[01:30:30]  And you get the drink girls that are fucking in the slinky little dresses, and they're hot  as fuck, and they want to fucking toy around.  You came out of retirement.  I did.  Exactly.  You came out of retirement.  You never got a Kahlua girl while you were sitting at the bar after he's just gone off  of work in your fucking construction outfit.  No.  They wanted nothing to do with you.  They didn't know when looking at my Apollo air conditioning shirt.  I don't think that really fucking...  Yeah, straight out of Bayshore, motherfucker.  There had to be problems before you got into radio, though. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  There were many an evening I had a flinger over my shoulder.  But you figured what?  It wasn't going to get any better, so I'll just stay in there.  But then when the radio thing happened, you realized, wait a minute, this could get better.  Yeah.  Is that what you're thinking?  Yeah, I hung in there.  Did she ever embarrass you publicly?  Oh, God.  Don't.  Don't.  It just didn't end.  Really?  It didn't end.  Am I...  Do I have permission?  Oh, please.  Go ahead.  We were at the Halloween bash at...  What was that club in Boston?  Not that it matters, but it's where all you guys play now. 
[01:31:30]  It's a comedy club.  Oh.  The big theater.  Yes.  The Wilbur Theater.  Wilbur Theater.  Okay, sure.  Jocks.  And Aunt's ex had a bit too much to drink and decided she needed to nap at the foot of  the bar.  Literally on the floor.  On the floor.  And Aunt went off begging.  Like, do you understand?  There's salespeople.  There's clients.  My boss is here.  I felt so bad.  I used to have these talks with her before we left the house to go out.  I was like, I had to have these talks, which I knew wouldn't work because they never did. 
[01:32:00]  But it was something like this.  It was like, look, we're going out.  And she would instantly start rolling her eyes like, oh, God, you don't have to tell me  this.  Meanwhile, I felt I had to.  Of course.  You had to.  I was like, look, we're going out.  I go, there's no problems right now, right?  She's like, no, no, there's no problems.  I go, okay.  So after we go out, after a few drinks, it's going to still be just like this.  There's no problems.  So there's no reason to fight.  Are there any reasons right now to have a fight?  No, no. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  So if I remind you of this later, if something does happen, will you remember that there's  no reason to fight?  Yeah, you don't even have to be.  Whatever.  And she was a light switch.  Like, she could be fine.  A couple of shots later, I swear, I could turn my head to look at the clock, turn back  and be like, ah, fuck, she's off, just gone.  And then the face would change.  It's like this smirky half eyes and fuck you. 
[01:33:00]  It's like, all right, look, remember what we talked about before?  I don't want to fucking hear your shit.  And it would just turn into this fight over nothing.  Over nothing.  Now, how was she the next day?  Was she apologetic or no?  Nothing ever happened.  Like nothing happened.  And why would I want to bring it up?  Right.  You know, it's over to have permission.  Oh, please.  Go ahead.  Yes, go ahead.  He's allowed to talk.  The statute of limitations is over.  No, no, no.  No, I'm just fucking.  He now talks about my ex, too, so it's good.  It's very therapeutic. 
[01:33:30]  I remember at N.E.W., when we were in break or whatever, or had to play our music or whatever,  she would call the hotline.  And like he's describing, like, nice as pie, just real nice, and go, hey, I'm heading to  the happy hour.  And that would put a switch in answer.  Oh, God, I remember that.  And then you would beg her, like, look, before I get there, just have just a couple.  Can you just have a couple?  Because I remember, I would get off at 7, so I would be down at the bar maybe 7.  Happy hour starts at 3.  45.  So she would call maybe 4 and go, I'm heading to happy hour. 
[01:34:00]  And the panic in his voice, because he knows that it might ruin his entire night if it's  not handled properly.  I'd go into the bar, and my buddy Randy would look at me the second I walked into the bar  and roll his eyes and look like, uh-huh, you've got your hands full now.  And I'd be like, oh, and she'd turn around, hey, what's up?  Oh, fuck.  That's making me uncomfortable.  And there was one time I had to, uh, I was still knocking tin, and, uh, we were at the  bar, and I was like, I gotta go home. 
[01:34:30]  I gotta fucking leave.  I gotta get up for work in the morning.  Nah, I don't fucking want to go.  I'm staying.  Fuck you.  And I'm like, you know, if you stay, I don't know how you're getting home.  You're hammered.  I can't fucking, no, I'm not gonna be able to sleep.  Fuck you.  All right, I'm leaving.  I went out to the van.  I started up.  I'm pissed.  And now I'm just thinking, I'm gonna go home and lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, not  be able to sleep, because this dummy's out somewhere.  So I just opened the van door.  I walked back into the bar.  I grabbed her physically off the bar stool, over my shoulder, into the van, and we drove 
[01:35:00]  away.  To the applause, by the way, of everyone on the bar.  Really?  They were applauding.  You took it.  Right?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Was she screaming when you picked her up?  We were carrying her out?  What was she doing?  She was rambling on about something.  I think she was completing the story she was telling on the bar stool.  Oh, like an officer and a degenerate.  So you had to move her to Boston when you guys started doing radio up there.  Yes.  So you had to move her out of Long Island, her comfort zone. 
[01:35:30]  No.  So she must have been angry at you.  No.  She was happier than anyone could be, because we were moving a mile away from her mother.  Oh.  Who lives up in Ashland, Massachusetts, and loves Gromanyer.  Look, we have different...  I liked his mother-in-law, actually.  Oh, my God.  I liked Judy.  I mean, but she was a handful.  I live with Dan's mother-in-law way past the point I should have. 
[01:36:00]  Now it was two of them.  Now I'm dealing with two of them.  They were of the same mold.  But we all moved into the mother-in-law's house, because we didn't have apartments yet.  Oh, so you guys were all...  Yeah.  And they...  Cool.  And Ann, and it's a side story, but I just want to tell Jim, Ann and his wife at the time,  they got out within, what, a couple weeks, maybe?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, hey, man, I'm not going anywhere that's kind of good.  I hope I lived with my mother-in-law.  Yeah, my...  Just you and her?  A while.  Well, my girlfriend at the time, you know, and we could get into that another day, she 
[01:36:30]  had a tough time leaving Long Island to go to Boston and have a better life.  So it took her a while.  So I'm like, well, fuck that.  I'll stay with the mother-in-law for a while.  There's food in the fridge, and I got laundry downstairs.  It was an odd situation.  And, man, I used to, you know, we worked from three to seven.  So at seven, I would get off, and it wasn't a long drive to Ashland, so I'd be back there  by 20 after seven, maybe.  And she was always at her mother's house, and I had to go in there, go down to the basement 
[01:37:00]  where they were watching videotaped episodes of General Hospital and Days of Our Lives, and  then friends would come on, and I'd be done with work and have to sit there while they  watched this dribble, because she didn't drive, so she had to go home with me.  So I'd just sit there, just downing Captains and Coke, just fucking...  Watching Friends?  Down, watching Friends, Days of Our Lives, and General Hospital. 
[01:37:30]  Oh!  Yeah.  One after the other.  You wouldn't want to watch them?  And I'd have to listen to like...  Oh, that Joey is so funny!  Can I back him up?  Every night he had to do this.  Every night.  It wasn't once in a while.  It was his routine after the radio show.  He had to go and watch those three shows before they could go home.  So you couldn't just go to your house and go, hey, you know, come by whenever you're done.  I'm going to go chill.  She didn't drive.  No, she didn't drive.  So I would have had to go back.  So I'd have to go back and get her, and I've been fucking pounding, pounding booze, just 
[01:38:00]  to dull the fucking pain.  When did you be...  This is the interesting thing about Anthony, because you're not that guy at all now.  No, I'm not, motherfucker.  But what changed, like, from being this codependent slob who is caretaking and worried and panicky  and, okay, we're not mad, to going, I need a gun and fuck everybody.  Yeah.  It's a great question.  Great question.  What did change?  Because you didn't have guns or any of that shit.  Yeah.  I think it's life experience, but I'm trying to think of a defining thing. 
[01:38:30]  So that changed.  Because it's really, like, if I had the chance, I would say to Hitler, like, when did you give  up on art?  When did you realize that painting wasn't working out for you?  Exactly.  Wow.  You didn't even have escape routes back then or nothing?  There was nothing.  See, that's where he was probably planning all that shit.  I think it might have started with a little sexual deviancy as far as the threesomes went 
[01:39:00]  and stuff.  Because she was into chicks.  Right.  And, you know, I was much more than willing to oblige getting a couple into the, you know,  relationship there.  Did you ever get your prick sucked by two at once?  No, no, nothing like that.  I mean, I got it sucked at one point and then, you know, had another one on my, not a prick,  but I had a vagina on my face.  Was there rules where you couldn't fuck the other one?  Yup.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, there were rules.  I noticed these weird rules they just make up along the way.  There's no, there's no guidelines to threesomes.  But let me tell you something.  When I was fucking laying in bed and then the wife would get up to go take a shower, pound  in the fucking other one.  And that was against the rules, obviously.  That was against the rules.  Because not unless, you know, they were in the bed.  So you had to get off her before she came back out of the shower.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where would you blow your load?  Shoot.  Right inside.  Well, you couldn't blow.  You're my hero.  Were you allowed to come with the other girls?  Was the other girl allowed to blow you and you could come? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It got to the point where it was so fucking, like, my wife got the tip of my index finger.  I would just diddle across the bed.  Right.  And then the other girl would just get, like, fucking every bit of passion I had in me.  If your wife would have fell off the bed, would you have been happy?  Oh, please.  Yes.  I had an ex that we had a threesome one time.  And she got mad because I was allowed to fuck the other girl. 
[01:40:30]  And I was fucking her.  And afterwards, she got mad because she said, I fucked her the same way I do her.  And I'm like, I only got one style.  That's all I know.  I fucking go 100 miles an hour.  Am I supposed to go switch to Southpaw?  Yeah, because even if I did switch to Southpaw, then she would have got mad.  Like, how come you don't fuck me like that?  You don't fuck me that new way.  So I figured, just do it the same way.  Yeah.  You do fucking move when you fuck.  I slowed down.  It's so weird that Norton knows that.  I switched it up.  What's his style, Jim?  I'm like an aging veteran.  Like, I throw a knuckleball now.  I'm like Wakefield. 
[01:41:00]  At first, I was a fastball pitcher.  Now, I throw knuckleballs.  Yeah, he's turned into fucking Phil Necro.  Yeah, I want to prolong my career, so I go slower.  One of the oddest.  One of the oddest.  My mule comes in crooked like a fucking knuckleball.  One of the oddest situations that happened.  It was like the first time having a threesome with the wife there.  And I was still knocking tin at the time.  I was able to pull one of those off.  That's fucking.  Even knocking tin.  See, that's Hall of Fame fucking material.  It really is.  Yeah, when you can install air conditioners and fucking have a tin, whatever the hell it is. 
[01:41:30]  A tin knocker, yeah.  A tin knocker, and you're pulling threesomes.  Pulling off a threesome.  It was pretty fucking, pretty sweet.  But we went back to my house, apartment, whatever the fuck.  And it was the wife, another girl, and me.  And I was like, you know, I'm going to take a shower, you know.  And let the girls kind of, you know, fool around a little.  And I come out all nice and clean and jump right in the fucking mix.  So I do that. 
[01:42:00]  I come back out, of course, so you don't get dressed.  You just have the towel on, easy access and shit.  So it worked out like everybody's just unclothed at this point.  The wife is laying on her back on the couch.  The other girl's on top of her.  They're face to face.  And now I'm behind with the new girl.  The ass and the pussy in your face.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I'm behind like fucking the new girl.  Yeah, that's right.  Doggy start backwards.  But now the wife is looking at my face.  So I'm trying not to look like I'm having that good a time. 
[01:42:30]  Like I can't put on the ultimate fuck faces.  I know, like this is unbelievable.  Because the wife's looking at me.  I'm like, if I look like I'm really digging this too much, you know, it's going to end.  And I sure don't want this to fucking end.  So I had to be like, meh.  You should have been, I love you, honey.  You should have been mounting the words.  I love you.  This is great.  Oh, no, it's not that good.  It's fucking, that's what it is.  That's classic.  Yeah.  So wait, would you dip down and stick it in the wife for a second and then back up? 
[01:43:00]  I don't think I switched back and forth much.  I did one and then the other one.  Who was allowed to put the condom on and take it off?  But I thought you were allowed, I thought you weren't allowed to fuck the other girls.  It's a condom.  Oh, I could.  As long as they were in the room.  She was still in the room.  Oh, she was still in the room.  Yeah, yeah.  And you could come with the other girls.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember I had a condom on that first time and then it just disappeared somewhere.  I don't know where it went.  I think it went into it.  Yeah, you took it off and you threw it under the bed.  Well, yeah.  I actually didn't, dude.  It just came off. 
[01:43:30]  I was like, oh, fuck, where'd that go?  And for days I was wondering if it was just inside one of them.  I didn't know.  Jesus.  Woody's Girls hotter than your wife?  Either equal to or hotter.  So like seven, eight?  Oh, fucking sixes.  Sixes.  All right.  Look.  It doesn't look.  There's another one in the room, even if it's a two.  Again.  Still.  The only thing I had to drive was a company van.  Yeah.  There's no shame there.  I used to have to. 
[01:44:00]  There's no shame whatsoever.  You don't have to explain it.  Even if she was bringing home twos.  That's like an inside the park homer.  It stills a fucking homer and a box score the next day.  Still fucking counts.  Doesn't matter.  You don't have to explain anything.  And inside the park homer.  Yes.  You don't have to explain anything.  That's funny.  Exactly.  Fucking 40.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It was.  I used to drive around a company work van.  The Apollo van was all I had for transportation. 
[01:44:30]  It was a load.  You go over a bump and you just hear all the tools and screws and metal rattle around in  the back.  And I wasn't allowed to drive at off hours, but I did.  And it had one of those, how am I driving with a number to call and then a code number  that was your van.  So I used to take black electrical tape and alter the numbers on the back.  It looked perfect.  It was like black, and the letters were the same dimension as the electrical tape on bright  yellow.  But you would just add a number. 
[01:45:00]  So it was a five.  Instead of a five, it was an eight.  Yeah.  I would turn like an F into an E.  Right.  So it was like F329.  F329, I would turn like F829.  So they'd call in this fucking van if I was driving like an asshole, which I did all the  time.  And they'd be like, oh, we don't even have that number.  Someone must have fucked up.  There's only two vans.  There was G.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They kept getting in the same wrong van, driving like an asshole.  Why are one of your vans backing a jet ski into Ashroken? 
[01:45:30]  I used to have a trailer hitch on it, and I'd get done with a job at like noon and hitch  up my jet ski and just back it into the fucking water.  I'd have the Apollo van fucking axle deep in salt water.  I'd give a shit.  People calling him.  There's two drunken sixes in the passenger seat.  So wait, can you bring back, was it the same girl all the time?  Was there ever repeat customers?  Yeah, there was some repeat customers.  Did she get nervous that maybe you were going to fall for them and leave her? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, she did, and then she was right.  Yeah, she should have.  She did, and then she was right.  She was right.  Yeah.  Because then she thought that maybe the girl would call you on the side, and you would  fuck her on the side without her there.  Yeah.  She gave me an ultimatum.  It's either me or her, and I picked her.  How long into it was that, the threesome?  It was an entire summer.  Boy, the wife let it go too long, see?  It was probably three or four months, right?  She let me get attached.  It's like a puppy.  I didn't want to give it away. 
[01:46:30]  How many different girls would you say you guys had threesomes with?  Not that many.  Probably three over the course of a few years.  Just that one summer, that was it?  No.  Oh, okay.  It was a few years, pre-radio and then post-radio, up until like 99, when we were at NEW, and  that's where it all ended.  I was like, yeah, I think I'm going to stay with this girl.  Bye.  And then he was all in with her.  Yeah.  He was all in. 
[01:47:00]  Wait, what made her give you the ultimatum?  The magic number of nine years.  What was happening?  He was a good boy for like nine years.  Yeah.  What was happening that she gave you the ultimatum?  She saw I was getting a little attached.  Yeah.  She saw I was like, I was, you know, calling, and she noticed.  She just noticed.  I was spending time like I wasn't coming right home from work, and she knew I was meeting her.  And did she ask you, are you meeting her, and you said yes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, so this was, oh, I see what was going on.  So this was, yeah, it turned into I was going out with this other girl. 
[01:47:30]  That was part of the threesome.  Yeah.  Ah.  You would have fucking, you would have alone time with her eventually?  Like, you both worked it out where I can have her, and then you can have her?  No.  Okay.  It was, it just worked out to be no more threesomes, and I'm with the new girl, and I want  no part of you.  When you were with the new girl, like, you guys would just hook up.  Did you ever go, hey, we got to throw the old one back in the mix?  Throw a bone?  No, it got to the point where the new girl was just like, ah, I don't even want to fucking 
[01:48:00]  deal with her anymore.  We were both in agreement.  And then there was a defining moment where me and the new girl were hanging out on my  couch at my house out on Long Island that I was renting, and my wife came stumbling  through the door and fell flat on her face through the screen door.  And we just turned around, looked, started laughing, and continued watching wrestling.  By the way, there's never been a better white trash description.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know, watching wrestling. 
[01:48:30]  Watching wrestling.  Unless you were with your sister.  Unless you were fucking your sister.  The wife falls through the screen while I'm watching wrestling with my girlfriend.  That's hilarious, dude.  And that was that, yeah.  So did she freak out when she found out that you were, the one you guys were having the threesomes  with, that's when she hit the fan?  That's when she said, it's either me or her.  And I was like, okay, I'm breaking up with you.  So I'm divorcing you.  How did you tell her?  What words did you use?  Do you remember?  I just said, yeah, then if you're giving me an ultimatum, then I'm leaving. 
[01:49:00]  She's like, meh, okay.  And then it wasn't okay.  You thought it would be okay?  I thought it would be okay.  It wasn't okay.  It wasn't okay.  Divorce took three years.  Three fucking years.  And I got fucked.  But, yeah, it's all in the past now.  You got some threesomes out of her.  Look at the bright side.  That's true.  I did.  That was pretty entertaining, to tell you the truth.  I remember that first time.  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:30]  The first time, it was a girl named Cindy, and we were at a club.  I was actually playing that night.  I appreciate that.  I was playing with my band.  Were you?  I think so, right?  No, that was an after party.  No, we were.  I remember it this way.  You were there, yeah.  It was when we were working at BAB, and we got the gig, and they threw a little thing together for us to say goodbye to us.  So, was that it?  Yeah, man.  Because all of a sudden, I'm like, where the fuck are you going?  And you took off with, and then you showed me why, and I'm like, oh. 
[01:50:00]  I'm like, I got this fucking two checks.  And then I had been drinking at the bar, of course.  This is when I used to really drink and drive a lot.  She was cute.  And, yeah, Cindy, she was fucking, she was nice.  And then I had to drive home, and all I'm thinking is, if I get fucking pulled over, I'm going to have to run from this cop,  because there's no fucking way I'm going to jail on a drunk driving charge when I got this first opportunity for this to ever happen.  So, I'm just like, oh, please, please don't get pulled over. 
[01:50:30]  So, there I am, clanging around in the Apollo van, driving home as nice as I can.  But, but I was so eager, I was like, trying not to speed, but I'm just, ah, ah, like an animal.  You could have taken a cab.  Not back then.  No?  No, I didn't have any fucking money.  No, Long Island's weird.  Oh, BAB, okay.  Long Island's weird for cabs, too.  It was Long Island.  Okay.  I didn't think, I didn't even think about things like cabs.  You're so much safer to drive drunk than get a cab driver on Long Island.  Oh, man, that's true. 
[01:51:00]  I'm telling you.  They're all fucking homicidal maniacs.  Sorry to the guys, because I'm sure they listen to us, but they're nuts.  So, you made it home.  Yeah, yeah, I made it home, and that's when the festivities started.  She had actually, at first, sold it as, I want to come, she, like, this Cindy girl brought  it up.  She came over to my wife and said, I want to come to your house and watch you two fuck.  And then she, my wife came over and approached me with the idea, and I thought it over. 
[01:51:30]  How long did you think you were before?  Oh, my God.  The word yes didn't come out of my mouth fast enough.  Yes!  Okay, so she was a friend.  It wasn't just someone you picked up in the bar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We had known her for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  And I used to look at her, like, so I was, like, fucking chomping, chomping at the bit.  Oh, my God.  And then we, you know, we would fucking, no matter where we went, we would end up fucking.  All of us just over friends' houses.  Didn't matter.  So you guys did a, so how many times did you say you fucked the other one? 
[01:52:00]  Oh, man.  Probably fucking a dozen.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  It was crazy.  Yeah, because usually, like you said, and eventually that's what happened, usually the  girls think, all right, they're going to fall for the other one, so they stop it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  After, like, two or three times, usually the most.  You know, I think the three, the, the, the, this time, the first time, the threesome  girl kind of put a stop to it.  I think because she, she was like, I'm not going to bust this fucking marriage up.  Right.  Because she, you know, could tell.  I was like, yeah, let's fucking do this. 
[01:52:30]  And I was trying to fuck her, you know, outside of the marriage, outside of the threesome.  I was always trying to get outside of that.  See, that's, that's against the rules.  You know, like, you got to look at it from the woman's standpoint.  If she's going to let you fuck her friend.  Yeah.  The least she could do is not do it when she's not there.  Well, you know what?  And that's fair.  That's fair.  You're right.  But you know what?  But how do you, how do you play it that way?  Nah, I, you know, I went through that phase.  The temptation at that point is going to be crazy.  No, I went through that phase and there was like nines that I was working.  And I just wouldn't even, once it was over, I was done. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  I wouldn't even acknowledge them unless it was in the situation.  Yeah.  But wasn't that tough?  Not really.  No, because I, I, I, it was a treat for me.  Hmm.  It was a treat.  Mine, it was a meal.  It wasn't the treat.  It wasn't a dessert.  It was, it was needed.  It was, it was sustenance.  It was an all you could eat.  Ah, just get as much energy as you can.  Yeah.  I just knew that the marriage was not very good.  Right.  If you have, you are, if I'm doing that, I mean, really think about it. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Because you come across as a pretty loyal in general with your relationships.  I am when they're going well, you know, and things are good.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe when you, when you and your ex broke up, because when I came on board,  uh, you were going through the divorce and Opie would reference it like funny stuff in  the paper and you would go like, ah, panicking.  And that was always good.  I never saw you and your ex chick fight.  Never.  And then you said you guys got sipped at each other about, uh, wine spilling on a plane. 
[01:54:00]  We were coming back from somewhere.  Oh yeah.  Yes.  That was the first time in the years that I'd known you.  Yeah.  That's when things started getting a little dodgy.  That him and his ex, the girlfriend started fighting.  What do you mean with the newer one?  The new one after the ex.  The one he left for the ex.  Melinda.  Who I, I knew.  Yeah, they never fought at all.  I never.  It was a completely, a completely different relationship.  I couldn't picture you fucking.  We had a great relationship.  Me and Melinda had a fucking great relationship right up until the end.  And then it just kind of got a little fucking weird.  Was it threesomes there too?  No.  No.  She was the threesome girl. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  I know.  She was the last threesome girl.  But there wasn't any.  No.  After that, no.  It was, I was fucking monogamous.  He was a good, he was, I really was.  He was a good egg.  She was fucking great.  No, I remember seeing you guys out a lot.  She was great.  I had no, I had no issues with her.  I still don't, you know, she, she's a little wacky.  I mean, I tried to keep a friendship with her after we broke up and then like a year went  by and then kind of trying to keep like a friendship thing going.  And then one day like she threw a glass at me in the jacuzzi. 
[01:55:00]  I was like, okay, look, you got to go permanently now.  I can't even fucking see her.  Why don't you throw a glass at you?  There's another, you know, every one of them are batshit crazy.  But you had to do something in her mind.  No, no, no.  No, in her mind.  She'll even admit, no, I didn't do anything.  This is a year after you guys were just friends.  She threw a glass at you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, probably more than a year.  But we still text, you know, we still text every so often.  But she just out of nowhere threw a glass?  Yeah.  No, no, we were talking about something. 
[01:55:30]  I'm just confused.  And it was something so inane.  It didn't matter kind of a thing.  And then she, you know, she fucking threw a glass glass at me in the jacuzzi.  I caught it.  And then I was like, yeah, you got to go.  I go, this just isn't at all fucking going to work as friends.  Did she have to leave your house all wet?  I think, yeah, I think so.  Yeah, it was just like, you got to go.  You got to fucking go.  Like right now.  She, like, put fucking her, you know, pants on and her fucking shirt. 
[01:56:00]  Was she cursing and yelling?  Yeah, she was pissed.  She was, like, legitimately like, fuck you, threw the fucking thing at me.  I'm like, why am I dealing with this?  Why am I fucking dealing with this?  We're not going out or anything.  And, yeah, that was that.  But we, it's been much better since we haven't seen each other.  You know, a few texts here and there, nice.  I still, her sister, Jen, and her sister's husband, Buddy, and their kids come over my house and go in the pool. 
[01:56:30]  They're really fucking cool.  What if she said she wanted to hook up again?  Like she just contacted you one night?  Like hook up?  In what way?  Like fuck one night.  Like fuck?  Yeah.  Nah.  No.  No?  No.  Serious.  Really?  No.  How about if she just wanted to eat your rear?  Maybe, maybe eat my rear.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's, it's Melinda Haber.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  She's saying.  She's, she wants her side out.  It was like four years later and I was mad. 
[01:57:00]  What were you fucking mad at?  Oh, she just texted you right now?  Where, where, where are you?  Hold on.  Don't go anywhere.  Let me call her.  Hold on.  Put this on fucking speaker.  See if she picks this up.  Do you think, you have a feeling it was Anthony's fault she threw to glass?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  No way.  No.  No way.  No?  No, probably not.  Hold on.  See if she picks it up.  This is crazy. 
[01:57:30]  Sounds like a ring.  You're calling?  Hi.  Hi.  You're on the air, by the way.  Oh, hello, air.  Uh, now, do you remember what you were so mad at that you threw a glass at me in the  jacuzzi?  It's the most ridiculous thing.  It was a ridiculous thing, right?  It was completely ridiculous, but I'm going to admit it was, it was extreme jealousy.  Wow. 
[01:58:00]  Because, you know how I make a little noises, like, uh, if something happens and I'll be  like, oh, and you used to make fun of it and you used to be like, oh, it's so cute.  And she'll just be like, oh, and you said the same thing about another girl, and I totally  freaked out because I was so drunk.  Oh, oh, oh, I kind of equated something that she did to another girl.  Ah.  And, wow.  Yeah.  Melinda, that's pretty, that's pretty fucking weak. 
[01:58:30]  I told you it was so ridiculous.  I was so trashed.  And I just got really mad because I was like, wow, you really moved on.  And why am I in his hot tub?  I was like, I'm just going to flip it off.  He moved on.  Why am I in his hot tub?  You know, that's a damn good point, Melinda.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Ronnie B always loved you best, by the way. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I'm driving to work.  Work?  What the fuck?  You're working?  Oh, shit.  Hey, Melinda, how good was Anthony in bed on a scale of one to ten?  Ten being the best.  Be honest.  How good was Anthony in bed on a scale of one to ten?  Is that what you said?  Yeah, ten being the best.  You know, while we were having sex, it was the best thing ever.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  We'll give a number.  It was the best thing.  It was ten.  It was a ten while we were together.  Absolutely.  I didn't want to be with anyone else.  We were totally compatible.  It was awesome.  It was the best thing ever.  We used to fuck, like, five, six times a night.  Really?  Really?  It was insane.  That's a week of my fucking night.  Remember when we were living at your mom's?  Hey, she was living at my house, okay?  Yeah, whatever that was.  It sure seemed like we were living at her house.  This is when I left.  She took us aside and told us, look, I can hear you chatting at night. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, chatting.  Is that what she said?  Chatting.  What were we talking about?  She's like, sure, if you know what I'm talking about.  The walls were so thin, I'm trying not to make any noise.  She's hearing my fucking guttural grunts and moans as I'm ravaging her little girl.  Five?  Now, is this pre-Viagara and Cialis days?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not even horny goat weed?  I've never used it.  Not even horny goat weed? 
[02:00:30]  Not anything.  You blow five loads in the night?  It was crazy.  I felt like I was chafing.  Oh, yeah.  We wouldn't be able to walk for hours, but we wouldn't be able to do it anyway.  We would be driving, literally driving down the West Side Highway, have to pull off the road and just fuck in my truck.  It got that crazy.  One time we were going, and we were like, oh, my God, there's an entire construction crew watching us.  Yeah, yeah, there was a construction crew watching us fucking because we just had to fuck.  And then in Brooklyn, we were going to Lemores, and we just pulled over on the side of the road and fucked up in Brooklyn. 
[02:01:00]  And then I just threw a rubber out the window.  We did a lot of that fucking.  Oh, yeah.  That was not a problem.  Damn.  I'm ready to throw a glass at you while you broke up with her.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Well, she broke up with me.  We were at the Borgata, and I was playing some blackjack.  And she walked up to me, and she goes, Anthony, I'm leaving.  And I was like, okay, here's the key to the room. 
[02:01:30]  She goes, no, I'm leaving.  I thought she was just leaving the table.  And she packed her shit and fucking left.  Did you get up from the table, or did you keep playing?  Did I get up, or did I keep playing?  No, no, you kept playing.  I was on a streak.  Come on.  You were doing really well.  I really, now I don't blame you to stop getting up.  You were winning.  Yeah, I think that run paid for my pool.  And then some.  And then some, yeah. 
[02:02:00]  All right there, Melinda.  Have fun.  Have a good day at work.  Woo-hoo!  I'll talk to you.  I'll see you later, bye.  Bye, Melinda.  Wow.  She's a fucking...  So you weren't on a hot streak, and you weren't getting up.  No, and I knew there was no reason to.  Why leave the table?  Yeah.  You know, it was over.  Jim, well, Dice is coming in a little while, right?  Yes, he is.  When Dice, when you first started opening for him in Vegas, he used to gamble, and he thought  you were bad luck, so he'd make you, like, leave the casino. 
[02:02:30]  At the Venetian, the first time I went in there with him, I want to say he dropped a quarter  million in cash.  It was a large amount of money.  Wow.  And Kenny and Happy Face, I was walking around, and Kenny goes, Andrew wants you to leave the  area.  He thinks you're bad luck.  My feelings were all hurt.  And that was, you only knew him, like, maybe a month or something like that?  No, it was a little longer than that.  We had done some, no, we had already done the Bally's run together.  Like, I was friends with him by this point.  Oh, no, no, it was before the Venetian. 
[02:03:00]  It was from the Bally's to the Venetian.  I think he was going over there to get the Venetian contract, and he was smart because he  gambled.  They saw he was a high roller, and they hired him for a lot of money.  Yeah.  But you had to leave the casino or leave the area?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Well, Dice is a big fucking better.  I was just sulking.  You're sulking and getting a cup of coffee?  Come on, dude.  Dice is a big better, though.  Yes, he is.  He's like, if he says leave, you fucking leave.  You don't want him to think you were responsible of him losing a lot of money.  Yeah, but he was probably right.  I'm a mush.  You're a mush.  Let's break. 
[02:03:30]  Florentine, what are you promoting today, man?  I'm in Wildwood this weekend.  Watch it tonight?  Tonight, yeah.  Tonight through Sunday.  And then I'm Mohican Sun next Saturday night.  Nice.  Then I'm doing my one-man show out in Los Angeles.  Well, that's comedy.  Tuesday, August 7th.  Yeah, Comedy Central Stage at the Hudson.  It's a free show?  Yeah, they don't charge any admission at this theater.  That's cool, man.  Yeah.  So it's a free show for anyone else to go.  All you got to do is RSVP at 323-960-5519. 
[02:04:00]  It's a great show.  It's called I'm Your Savior, and it's a free show.  Just make your reservations for August 7th in L.A.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Are we still on?  I just quickly want to say, my sister Dawn texted.  She goes, that was awkward for me to listen to.  Why?  Because it's my sister.  I know.  Shut up. 
[02:04:30]  Why?  She knows all that.  Well, she probably doesn't like hearing the gory details.  Is it the hearing it, or the getting stuck to the seat, listening to it?  I wish I would have just thought that.  Call her now.  I'm sorry.  I want to know what part was awkward.  I know the parts that were awkward.  She doesn't like hearing about the graphic, we were fucking here and fucking there.  She doesn't like to hear what a great lay.  She grew up with fucking...  She goes, five times a day.  Yeah.  She grew up with a...  She grew up next to a fucking...  A cock sump pump. 
[02:05:00]  Fucking...  A real swinging dick.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no idea.  All those years in the next room, that fucking...  That very well-equipped penis was being pumped up.  And she knows the ex.  She knows the ex.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  The first wife, and she knows the friend, Cindy.  She knows Cindy that was bending over the first time.  Yeah, yeah, she does.  Knew them all.  Knew them all.  She even knows that you were fucking while watching some two girls kiss.  She has really graphic visuals. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, that degenerate shit.  And she was probably meeting you guys at Lemores, and you guys fucked in the car like two minutes before.  She was like, I thought he spilled something on his hands.  Is that why he smelled?  He hugged me and his face smelled.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  I mentioned the Steve C. Fund.  It's doing very, very well.  I donated yesterday.  Did you?  Yeah.  We want to thank everyone that did donate, because Steve C. left a very young son behind. 
[02:06:00]  Around the age of our sons there, Florentine.  About two.  A little over two.  And, of course, a wife that loved him dearly.  And a stepdaughter.  So, people are donating at tinyurl.com slash Steve C. Fund.  How's it going, E-Rock, with that?  It's doing good.  We're over $35,000.  Wow.  Damn.  That's pretty sweet, man.  Fuck.  That's pretty sweet.  People coming to that table, as they say.  That's going to help MJ a lot.  I was just going to send her a check, but I might go through the fund. 
[02:06:30]  Send the check.  Yeah, a check's better.  Well, because, you know, then they take their taste and this and that.  A little check right to her would be nice.  Yes, certainly.  Or somebody takes a take of the donation.  Yeah, a little bit.  They've got to run the site.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, you know, one of those deals.  Then there's a tax situation.  If you go there, I don't know.  It's a whole thing.  So, she's got to figure some stuff out.  But good news.  It's tinyurl.com slash Steve C. Fund.  Someone donated $5,000 last night.  Yeah.  We don't know who. 
[02:07:00]  But, yeah, they donated $5,000 for it.  Thank you very much.  Mm-hmm.  Damn.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Also, remember stevec at gmail.com.  MJ wants people to, you know, send your thoughts and stories about Steve so his son can read  about it someday.  It's just a horrible situation.  Yeah, I want to do that.  I would definitely, because he really helped me out a lot.  I mean, especially with the kid stuff and then with concerts and everything.  So, I want to ride a nice snow to his kid.  Always had everyone's back.  Yeah, he was amazing. 
[02:07:30]  Always, always, always.  Yeah.  The other thing, we're doing a live broadcast in Chicago.  Let's not forget about that.  August 10th.  Yeah, August 10th.  And we're definitely doing these three things so far, right?  Oddest thing you own.  Chip off the old block where people are going to imitate Chip.  And I want to see a look for Chip.  Because I need to get a look for Chip.  Right.  Because I get recognized too much when I do it.  So, I want a, and don't make it so crazy that it's not a believable person.  I want to have a look for Chip.  Sort of a disguise?  Yeah, like a mullet or something that is real, though. 
[02:08:00]  It has to feel real.  So, we'll be judging on how Chip looks and how he sounds.  Yeah.  And also, we're doing the, God, we'll never grow up.  The worst breath.  Worst breath.  Who smells the breath?  E-Rod.  Oh, right, because he pukes at everything.  We didn't even ask him.  We told him.  We told him that he's doing that.  We should get Kelly out there for that, too.  Yeah.  Robert Kelly.  Oh, yeah.  Anyone that throws up easily.  Yeah, that'd be great.  And you don't have to necessarily have bad, you can make your breath bad for the event. 
[02:08:30]  Does Bill Gates have a wig?  It looks like it.  Why?  It looks like something's going on there.  If you're Bill Gates, why the fuck do you need to wear a wig?  Yeah, it's too gray underneath, right?  Is it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It looks suspicious.  There's something going on.  You know, he could get a good wig, so.  But he doesn't need one.  What is this?  He's a billionaire.  Tape a fucking fleshlight to your head.  Who cares?  Fleshlight.  You're fucking, yeah, you're Gates.  He's a multi-billionaire, I believe, right?  He has a few bills, huh?  He started Microsoft. 
[02:09:00]  Crazy.  Yeah, but what are they?  Windows.  Come on.  So.  So the live broadcast, Friday, August 10th, 115 Bourbon Street in Marionette Park.  All the info's on our Facebook page.  Oh, and also.  Yes.  If you would like to be in our pig race for a chance to win $1,000, email Opie Anthony.  It's just, there's no and in it.  It's Opie Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  We want some fat pigs, you know, doing a pig race for us.  Oh, yeah.  On all fours.  And then we're going to do it.  Not all.  And then we're going to do another heat with hot girls, hopefully. 
[02:09:30]  So we want hot girls, too.  Let's be honest.  We have a better shot at getting fat ones.  Yeah, I know.  And we'll be nice.  Yeah.  And if you don't want people to see your face, we do have a pig nose.  So we're good.  Oh, so you put them.  That's great.  We're gentlemen.  We're gentlemen.  We're gentlemen.  We're gentlemen.  And someone tweeted yesterday, do you have to buy tickets to this event?  No.  It's free.  Free.  Just show up.  We're hoping to get a nice crowd in Chicago.  We don't know.  We've never been up there.  Yeah.  You guys have been up there a million times.  I've never been to Chicago.  I can't wait.  I've done well there at certain times.  Other times I haven't. 
[02:10:00]  That's why it's, I don't know.  But I've been watching the Twitter, though.  People already, a few people bought plane tickets already.  They're flying in.  How cool is that?  It's from Midway to O'Hare.  You guys should go to Wrigley for a game.  I would love to.  First time ever.  In June, I went.  I did a gig there.  How was it?  It's unbelievable.  Wrigley's right on the street, like Fenway.  And there's just bars, fucking restaurants right around.  Everybody's partying.  Everybody's drinking at three in the afternoon.  Hot chicks.  Is there more Cubs fans or White Sox fans up there? 
[02:10:30]  Well, I went to a Cub-Tiger game.  It was an interleague game.  And there was more Tiger fans there.  The Cub fans don't even care.  They just sit there and drink.  Right.  And everybody else's fans are at the stadium.  I think I went to Wrigley one time.  Remember the Chicago Comedy Festival?  Yeah.  I might have went there with Otto.  I don't remember.  I went to the field.  In the middle of the second inning, I had to fucking drop a ham out of my asshole.  So I left the game, went back to the hotel, and shat like a pig. 
[02:11:00]  I had to shit.  It was like the type of shit where I thought I was going to shit my pants in the stadium.  So I had to leave the ball game to go home and go duty.  You couldn't do it there at the stadium?  No.  Dude, it was going to be a big one.  And I liked his shit peacefully.  That's funny.  Breaking entertainment news.  Oh, no.  Who died?  No, no.  Good news, actually.  Louis C.K. nominated for Best Actor in a Comedy for an Emmy.  An Emmy.  Best lead in an Emmy.  Good for Louis, man. 
[02:11:30]  Has he won the Emmy yet for that show?  I think he's won something for it.  I know he's won for stand-up, but the fact that he's being nominated is fucking phenomenal.  The season's great so far.  Yeah, I was just catching up last night.  I watched one where he got blown in the car.  How great was that episode?  I was telling my girl, I go, the best fucking thing about that show, and I love it, is just  the opening of that show is just him walking down the street, he gets a pizza slice, he  fucking takes a bite, he wipes his fucking mouth, and then he walks into the comedy cellar.  There's no overacting. 
[02:12:00]  There's no fucking physicality.  He's just a guy looking around.  Because that's what you guys usually do.  But I love that that's how TV should be, and everybody loves that show.  It doesn't have to be over-the-top, silly, he doesn't have to trip, none of that shit.  You don't like the funny songs where everybody's jumping on the couch?  None of that.  He doesn't have to fucking dance, he's just walking down the street and he gets a slice  and he goes and tells dirty jokes.  I like a good beginning where people look right into the camera and laugh, and then nod.  Yeah, do that laugh, like, oh, funny stuff's on the way. 
[02:12:30]  Like happy days, where they would kind of be like, ah, Mr. C, oh.  Well, I don't mind that, that was the 70s, you know, that was the time.  They're only in a record.  Yeah.  There's a record spinning around their head.  There's a, you know, it's a little different show.  Hey.  Aids.  I don't know.  Dyson's going to be here in a few minutes.  All right.  Hey, um, you're not a basketball guy?  No.  All right, so I was going to ask you about Jeremy and then, so you don't care about that, really.  I'm just sick over it.  Sick that the fucking Knicks couldn't figure something out. 
[02:13:00]  There's some kind of salary cap thing or something.  Yeah, they were going to get...  That's coming.  They were going to get penalized, but, man, I mean, they, I don't know.  Fuck, it seemed like they were...  It's like a cap thing.  Like the Yankees now with baseball, there's some big luxury tax coming, I think, next season.  Even bigger than what they have now, so that's why they can't go get Cole Hamels and all  these guys like they used to do at the trading deadline.  Yeah.  Because they got killed in about a year, so that's why they've been like...  They've got to keep them...  Yeah.  Right.  So that's what happened in basketball, too.  Building these super teams.  Are you an Olympics guy? 
[02:13:30]  No, fuck it.  So you're pretty much...  I've never watched one second of that.  The Olympics stink.  It's fucking awful.  We all make believe it.  It's the worst programming ever.  We all make believe it's great.  It's not.  Except for a couple moments.  It stinks.  Except for a couple moments, it's really a waste of time.  There's a couple of good moments on a highlight reel, but by and large, 95% of it sucks dick.  It's a bore fest.  All of a sudden, you're tuning in because you're like, all right, I'll check out the Olympics  and all it is is heats.  It's the second heat.  Yeah, it's the second heat.  The finals are in a week, but they're showing the heats. 
[02:14:00]  It's like, who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  Show me the finals and everything.  That would be a start.  Yeah, it did.  It means nothing.  So you're more just a football kind of baseball fan.  Yeah.  No, definitely baseball.  Football and baseball.  Yeah, pretty solid on both.  Mets suck.  What are they, out of it?  They've lost like seven in a row.  Yeah, six or seven in a row right now.  I forgot the baseball season was happening.  I know.  I literally never watch baseball anymore.  It's kind of just there this year.  You used to be a huge Yankee fan, too.  Huge Yankee fan, a huge Cowboy.  I don't watch any sports except UFC anymore. 
[02:14:30]  And there's no real reason for that.  It started off with the guys blowing you off.  It really did.  So many of the athletes I've met have been cunts that I just can't enjoy them anymore.  Not all of them.  Some of them are great.  But I've met way too many that were just douchey to fans.  And as a guy who's not douchey to his fans, it just annoyed me so fucking much.  So I started to like the athletes who are really nice to their fans, which are the UFC guys.  And I'm not whoring for the UFC.  I mean, that's honestly why I watch it.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Like more than baseball.  I can't enjoy watching baseball anymore.  I just can't.  Aw.  Yeah.  It fucking annoys me.  I'm going to a Yankee Red Sox game.  I would go.  I mean, I don't think baseball stinks.  I just can't watch it.  I like a good, like where it's nice out and you fucking go to the game.  Oh, you sing, take me out to the ball game.  Sure.  It's so much fun.  You don't like that?  You don't like it?  Buy me some peanuts and crack or do you sing along?  No, it stinks.  Everybody.  Root, root, root for the home team.  If they don't win, it's a shame. 
[02:15:30]  Is it really a shame?  There's fucking 162 games a year.  It's not a shame if the team loses on April 16th when the fucking season goes to October 1st.  It's not that big of a shame.  It really isn't.  I was ready to argue the point with you, but you just shut me up.  That's hilarious.  My only for the home team.  If they don't.  Wait, I don't even know how the rest of the song goes.  It's one, two, three strikes.  You're out at the old ball.  There it is, Jim. 
[02:16:00]  Remember, it was written in 18.  I don't care.  We'll fucking update it.  Take me out to the crowd.  Take me out to the ball.  Buy me some peanuts and crack or jack.  I don't care if I never get back.  It's root, root, root for the home team.  If a Negro comes in, it's a shame.  Because it's the 1800s.  It's one, two, three strikes.  You're out.  At the old ball game. 
[02:16:30]  It's okay at Wrigley when they're drunk and everybody sings it.  I get it.  But other than that.  Well, they do it right up there.  Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.  What's the line?  I don't care if I never get back.  You never get back where?  Home.  They just want to be in the ball game forever.  They just want to be at the ball game.  Just because you bought them peanuts and cracker jacks, they never want to go home.  There's a lot.  They just want to fucking sit there all night.  There's lots of things better than peanuts and cracker jacks, by the way.  And by the way, they forget that a peanut cracker jack shit is on its way.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's fucking change the lip. 
[02:17:00]  Buy me a beer and a Hummer, and then maybe I won't come home.  Fucking peanuts and cracker jacks.  I'm going to shut both of you up.  What about when Ozzy did it?  Now what do you got to say?  I said that was at Wrigley.  That's what I said at Wrigley.  It's okay.  It's in the afternoon.  Everybody's drinking.  They're fucking drunk.  There's hot chicks there.  I get it.  You got that E-Rock.  You got a celebrity doing it?  Hey!  Let's go out in the ball.  What?  Take me and do it every lesson to you. 
[02:17:30]  I love you and everyone I have to be.  What?  And I'm going out in the ball.  Oh, my God.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  For if we do things like you're out at the old ball game.  That's not it.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's it.  That's his microphone isolated. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, let's get some runs.  Come on, don't miss it.  Let's get some runs.  Someone said, do you know the song?  And he probably said yes, and he just knows the rhythm of the song.  Oh, my God.  And he figures the crowd would hide what he was saying.  That's definitely him.  I don't know.  I know he was there with Sharon.  I heard him at the end there.  But I thought it was.  Well, find another version on YouTube.  On YouTube.  I do believe that's the version.  Wow.  He just didn't know the words.  He knew kind of the cadence of the song.  Right.  Just kind of went with it.  It's only acceptable at Wrigley Field. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  That song.  Sticks.  That's the best version of it I've ever heard, though.  Travis, you got a tidbit on this?  It's him.  We've played it before.  It's old.  Yeah, no, I know.  I'm saying it's him.  Okay, maybe it is.  Yeah.  All right.  I think it's Sharon Osborne.  You're not big time here.  I think it will be for Rick and Rick and Rick and Ozzley Osborne.  He doesn't even have the words in front of him.  All right, Chicago.  I want to hear a real crazy crowd start singing with me. 
[02:19:00]  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  I can't hear you.  Are you ready?  He's not giving him time, so he is.  One, two, three.  Yeah.  Go out to the ground.  Go out to the ground.  Take me in the ground.  I'm like, what? 
[02:19:30]  Kerry Wood looking at the dugout.  Oh, my God.  Posada looks puzzled.  Of all the dramatic things.  Yeah, let's get some runs.  Yeah, let's get some runs.  Come on, don't miss her.  Let's get some runs, guys.  Let's get some runs. 
[02:20:00]  You'd think that he would have the words in front of him, though.  You'd think.  Yeah, you would think Sharon would have it prepared.  Whatever the fuck you want.  That was great, though.  Okay.  The reactions in the crowd were phenomenal.  They were like, what the hell is going on here?  Kerry Wood stuck his head in a dugout.  Like, what the fuck's going on up there?  Dice is on his way up.  On his way up.  Dice!  Very good.  He was at my wedding.  Yes, he was.  Dice man, huh?  How was that?  Was he behaving himself?  Dice loves weddings. 
[02:20:30]  Like, you think that Dice is just like this.  He loves that stuff.  He's very romantic.  He loves Valentine's Day.  He loves cards.  Loves candy.  He loves candy.  Loves holding hands.  You are my everything.  He is a hopeless romantic.  He is.  He is.  He's a sap.  He goes, when I get in a big fight with my chick, he goes, then afterwards we make up  and then we fuck.  I'm like, really?  I go, no, I get angry.  I go, I can't let it go.  He goes, you're like a chick.  You got to let that go.  Oh, man, really?  You got to get the romance back in your relationship.  I'm like, is this coming from him? 
[02:21:00]  He's a romantic romantic.  He loves that stuff.  I was never into makeup sex either.  Me neither.  No, I hate.  No.  Just have sex.  I'm still lingering, lingering pissed is still there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want to fuck a chick that I'm just, that I'm angry at.  I'm mad at.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why should I give you my seed?  You got to wait for the anger to go away a little bit.  Yeah, exactly.  Like the next day.  Makeup sex, that's stupid.  I'd rather cheat on her while I met her.  Hold on, I'm trying to take care of Florentine, because you know when Dice gets in here, it's  over.  So, what's the big plug there, Jim?  You got literally 15 seconds. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  He's walking down the hall.  Get it all out.  Tonight through Sunday, Club Caswell, Wildwood, New Jersey.  July 28th, Mohican Sun in Connecticut.  And Tuesday, August 7th, Comedy Central Stage in Los Angeles, California.  It's a free show.  I'm doing my one-man show.  All you have to do is call 323-9...  Just go to JimFlorentine.com.  You can see my one-man show for free in Los Angeles.  Jesus, Dice.  Hey.  Dice.  Andrew Dice Clay.  There he is.  How you doing, Dice? 
[02:22:00]  Hey, Andrew.  What's up?  You are...  Wow.  Wherever you want.  Doesn't Dice look great?  Wow.  What do you want?  You've lost even more weight since the last time you were in here.  At the cage.  Holy fuck.  Is this the lightest you've ever been?  For many years.  For a long, long time, right?  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  What's the waist?  Actually, 33.  Holy shit.  I just did that...  Norton.  Hi, Andrew.  I mean, you walk in, you put me under all this pressure already. 
[02:22:30]  There's no pressure.  It's just, what size is your pants?  Don't do this.  No, these are bigger.  But the actual thing, I had to do a war drum thing for the wood.  Right.  You know.  Are you going to be all right without the smoking thing?  When?  Up here?  There was major problems after you left.  No, I know.  Wow.  The guy's not around, though, right?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Noah?  No, no, no, smoking.  No, no, no.  Did I like it?  Dice, dice. 
[02:23:00]  Wait a minute.  Where's the mic level?  There were a lot of problems last time.  A lot of problems.  Nice.  Wait a minute.  Not even, I don't care.  I could give a shit about management, the problems.  It's killing me when you light up.  Oh, so this is all about you?  Well.  It's the fucking sound.  No, it went into the vents and other studios complained and we actually got yelled at by  the building and by management.  We got in trouble.  A lot of trouble.  Did I light it?  No.  No, but you, you know, you put a cigarette in your mouth.  I'm assuming you're going to light.  No, but I did that for years anyway.  I could do this.  I remember.  I don't know if you could do that.  No. 
[02:23:30]  I don't think you could do it.  I'm going to try.  I got a hundred.  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try.  Who wants to bet me?  No.  I don't want to bet.  I don't want to make it a game.  Travis is already shaking his head.  No, it's not a game.  I don't want anybody getting in trouble.  I don't want to make it a game.  Wait, let's talk to Travis real fast.  Travis.  Look at Travis looks so scared.  Travis is so scared.  No, no, no.  Get him in here for one second.  Obviously, this guy.  Get Travis in for a second.  Travis.  You're shaking her right, right?  Explain to Dice.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Explain to Dice.  We've never seen Travis look this serious.  Travis, explain to Dice.  I love Dice.  Of course.  You know what it is, Travis? 
[02:24:00]  It has nothing to do with personal feelings about Dice.  Why are you bad-mouthing Dice, though?  Oh, man.  Let me ask you a question.  Do you smoke Skips Bates?  I did, before Skips Bates.  Oh, so you know what I'm going through, right?  Yeah, oh, absolutely.  So this is your way of getting back at smoking.  Oh, man.  Then you put out this law in the building, which is supposedly the building of no laws.  You know, where you can say and do what you want if we want to fuck a chick on the counter  and spray her and throw out the 38-floor window. 
[02:24:30]  That's okay.  That's what it used to be.  But don't let the cigarette while you're doing it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's sad.  You know what I mean?  The building of no laws.  We'll have a lot of laws.  That's Travis's rule.  That's what this kind of radio is.  It was supposed to be that, but it's the building of a lot of laws.  I know.  You know what?  I actually called into an Audi show last night.  Yeah.  You know, and he's with this guy, Nicky D.  Nick DePaulo.  Yeah.  And, you know, he's telling me, like, well, you know, you can't curse. 
[02:25:00]  You know, of course, we're also on a fake radio, you know, still.  And I'm going, what do you mean?  But you're on the other one.  Why can't I curse on that?  And they break it down.  You know what I mean?  Donate the curses with the regular people that are too cheap to get real radio.  Kind of makes sense.  You know what I mean?  It makes sense.  Like, you're on both, so why can't we just do both things?  Yeah, and just split it up.  Like, even if I curse, like, whisper, that fucking hell way.  You know, so not everybody eats it.  Well, I don't think a whisper stops it from going through it, Dice. 
[02:25:30]  I know that.  No, but what I'm saying is not as many people, if you have something bad going on with the  ears, you don't take it in in a certain frequency.  Look, I'd be all for it.  You know what I mean?  I like the idea of cursing on regular radio.  It feels very good in here today.  The vibe is good.  I'll be.  Let's ask Travis, though.  If he lights up, what happens?  Just totally break it down.  Break it down, Travis.  Honestly, if he lights up first, Kenny's in trouble.  Oh, boy.  Because Kenny's the first line of defense.  That's the game.  That's your little game. 
[02:26:00]  I'll be in trouble, and you're looking pretty serious about it.  Travis, we'll talk about this in person.  Oh, man.  I mean, like, not when we're here.  You know, like, when you leave work, I'll hang around outside.  I'll wait to just go over with you.  You know what's fucked up?  Kenny being in here, when Dice is in here talking about the cigarette thing, it's an Obi-Wan  Kenobi Darth Vader moment.  Like, he was the master.  But no, you, you know, that whole fucking...  Hold on, let's break it down further.  Hold on, Kenny.  Kenny, what's up?  Hold on.  Kenny, what happened? 
[02:26:30]  If this fucking guy has such a hatred for me, that he's going to stop me from smoking.  Travis, you don't have to be rude to our guest just because he can't smoke.  I know.  What am I thinking?  Well, that's why we bring Kenny into the situation.  Kenny, why don't you explain to Dice what happened after he left with all the smoke in the vents?  Andrew came here to entertain, not to smoke.  Yeah.  You see?  He has a great story to tell, but decides not to.  That's true.  That's fair enough.  It was, it was, sorry, whatever.  I guarantee he smokes.  So does Jim Norton's gas go through these vents, too, when he farts in here? 
[02:27:00]  Does anyone else complain?  There's a god it does.  I fucking hope so.  How come nobody has ever smelt that gas before?  Yeah, that's true.  I don't buy that whole vent thing.  Forget the cigarettes.  Were you talking about the wedding at all?  No, not really.  We're talking more about Anthony's.  It's over already?  No, why don't you talk about the wedding?  What do you got on the wedding?  Well, I, like, that's what I said.  We hear you're a romantic.  No, it's not, it's not about that.  Me and my wife are fine, you know, but, uh, you know, the chick with the dirty feet? 
[02:27:30]  Who?  That was stopping me from getting my chicken?  The maid of honor, like the girl who made the speech, but her feet were, uh.  No, no.  How do you know what her feet look like?  Her feet look like she stepped in tall.  Yeah, they were black on the bottom.  What is with girls?  How do we know that?  You know what gets me crazy?  Who gives a fuck?  This girl comes up to make a speech.  I think it's your wife's friend, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, we're not even an hour into the wedding party, but yet they got the shoes  off.  You know, like she's 18 and a half years old with the filthy, dirty feet that I want to 
[02:28:00]  throw up on myself.  I haven't had a piece of bread in the place.  You know, and I'm looking around going, who the fuck is this chick with the filthy feet?  You know, and talking about, you know what she was talking about?  Her life.  You know, and not about your wife.  She's going, and even though when I was traveling hundreds of thousands of miles and seeing the  world, my, what does it say?  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:28:30]  Who gives a fuck?  That's why you unmarried fucking chick, this is the problem.  You're walking around in mud, right?  With this big boxy dress.  Her hair's in a fucking bun.  Let me explain.  So you're my friend.  I love you.  And I love the wedding.  You know?  Sounds right.  But if the guys that were there that are married for nine and 10 years already, if your wife  is going to invite some extra pussy just for guys to look at, they can't be walking around  with 30 feet. 
[02:29:00]  Like they were just playing in the park after it rained.  Right.  You know, this was a woman with a bun.  Don't they fucking know?  These motherfuckers, you don't wear a bun.  Nobody wears a bun to a wedding.  No, everybody wears their hair up.  Obviously, you're single.  You're looking for cock, right?  You're looking for somebody to feed you.  They wear their hair up.  Hey, guys, how did you see the bottom of her feet?  When she was standing there, you could see it.  Oh, because she's doing her 15-minute fucking speech about what I have. 
[02:29:30]  No, I thought that I was in the Caribbean.  Who gives a fuck?  This is about Jim and Samantha.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And she's picking up her feet.  Oh, she was trying to do a cutesy thing where she picks her feet up a little.  But she wasn't cute, and I was fucking gagging, and so was everybody at the table.  Yeah.  But it was a nice wedding.  And I'm looking for chicken.  I'm like, you know, here's some bread.  You just wanted something to eat.  Some bread and butter. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they had to wait for the speech then.  You know, so I tell my wife, I'm going to ask this chick while she's standing up there,  grab the waiter and get me some bread.  Do you know what I mean?  She's giving a speech?  Oh, my God.  The speech was, I don't even know what it was about.  It's probably about how they met and relationships.  The last minute of it was, I love Jim, you know, him and Samantha, you know, just the  perfect blend, like you got to say at every wedding.  I get it.  You know?  And then we...  You know, but she's picking a...  It's filthy. 
[02:30:30]  They do it in...  It's not just her.  It's every one of these fucking slobs.  This is something that these...  They all leave on a Friday night to go out in a pack of desperation.  So each one doesn't know how many hairs are going to hang out from a fucking skirt to  show her pussy line, right?  You know?  And then they come into the place all nice with the pumps, and by the time they leave,  with the bare feet, with glass sticking out of it, these fucking dirty hoes. 
[02:31:00]  But, you know, nice girl.  I mean, I don't know.  I'm sure she's a nice person.  Look, that was my run requirement.  I said, the wedding party, no chicks in fucking...  With the hair up.  I want them all down.  You want to know something?  You came to my wedding, right?  Yeah.  You know what my wife did?  She actually had, like, a thing full of, like, slippers for the footless girls.  You know?  And these chicks are walking around on the roof out there.  I couldn't even have a drink.  I want to throw up.  It was that bad.  I want to throw up.  Tell her.  Tell her.  I will. 
[02:31:30]  Let her know, for the next 20 weddings, that she'll never be married at because of her  dirty feet.  Maybe wash your feet.  Even Norton got, you know, disgusted.  He saw a chick with lima bean ass.  What?  Yeah, I liked her.  You want?  What happened?  Lima bean ass cheeks.  I was staring at her all night.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, yeah.  Sam's friend, yeah.  Why, when he shot with them?  You might.  I don't know.  They were both single, her and a friend.  I know.  They left.  See, they were nice.  But the thing is, you know, next thing you know, footless. 
[02:32:00]  You know, there they are walking around footless with mud on them.  I said it looked like she stepped in Eddie Griffin.  Her feet were pitch black.  No, no.  Not Eddie Griffin, because he's a lot lighter than her feet would ever be.  Yeah, I should have said fucking, who's darker?  Oh, well.  Manute Ball.  Damn it.  Do you want to go with an athlete?  Yeah, go to a place.  I don't want to get mad.  You know, it's a beautiful occasion.  I told him how romantic you are.  You like stuff like that. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, I do like that.  I was looking forward to it.  Does Dice slow dance?  I didn't do anything.  I had to get out of there.  You had to get out of there?  I couldn't take the foot thing.  You got a foot fetish at all, Dice?  Do you like that?  No, I hate dirty feet.  Yeah.  But do you like clean feet, though?  Yeah, I like clean feet.  I like chicks.  My chick's always in the heels.  It looks sexy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you suck toes?  Will you suck toes?  Yeah, what do I give a fuck?  As long as I get a heart on doing it.  You know what I mean?  I'll suck your asshole with a straw.  What do I give a shit? 
[02:33:00]  Just let me blow my wad.  What's the difference?  We saw Dice at the Riviera in Vegas.  I heard.  It was a good time.  It was hilarious.  Really, really funny.  We had such a great time.  Thanks for having us down there, Dice.  It was so much fun.  And that fucking scumbag talking about that.  Who?  Talking about that fucking scumbag.  Oh, that asshole.  No, Franny, what the fuck her name is?  This motherfucker.  Who opened for me in Vegas?  I just want you to say, who opened for me?  Your boys.  I wasn't even, besides that.  Eleanor.  Who did the comedy? 
[02:33:30]  Eleanor Wheels, right?  That's right.  Eleanor.  Right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right?  So this fucking piece of shit wants to put on Twitter, looking to get publicity off my  fucking name.  I'm alerting the news.  Dice doesn't like to take pictures with girl comedians.  He hates like girl comedians.  Oh, I saw that.  This motherfucker, Fran Suckdick, I call her.  Right?  This stupid fuck.  You know who I'm talking about.  What's his name's fucking wife?  Franny, what the fuck? 
[02:34:00]  I don't know either.  A force, right?  Bonnie McFarland.  Franny.  I don't even know this fucking chick's name, right?  Franny, it's Bonnie McFarland.  What happened?  I want to take pictures with just all the guy comics.  Where was that?  Oh, this is at my wedding.  This is at the wedding.  Oh, at the wedding.  And then this motherfucker.  What happened in Vegas?  No, wait.  No, this is in Vegas.  No, I'm bringing out a point.  All right, go ahead.  That, you know, when I was taking a picture with all the guy comics, you know, she's like  jumping in there.  I'm going, no, just the guys, right? 
[02:34:30]  Right, right.  I just want the guys.  And then I'm calling her over, and this classless piece of fucking shit that talks like a fucking  truck driver is giving me the fingers.  I'm going, number one, I don't like girl comics.  I like girl comics that are fucking funny.  I can't help that this motherfucker is talentless, okay?  That is not my problem.  I work with Roseanne Barr.  Rosie O'Donnell used to open for me.  Eleanor, the girl, Eleanor Kerrigan opened for me now. 
[02:35:00]  These are great stand-up comics, so don't put a thing in the media like Dice hates girl  comics.  I just hate the ones that fucking stink at what they fucking do, and she's fucking  awful, and I think she's a scumbag for fucking with me.  Wait, were you sure she wasn't kidding?  No, she wasn't kidding.  She put it on her fucking Twitter.  We're talking about Bonnie McFarlane.  Yeah, she thought I wouldn't see her little fucking tweet, this unknown piece of fucking  shit.  How about while your husband's out there trying to break his balls and do the kind of comedy 
[02:35:30]  he should do?  How about you stay home and actually raise the fucking baby you have, rather than trying  out for a fucking Tampax commercial, you dumb fuck.  Oh, fuck with me.  We got the actual tweet.  What is it, Iraq?  I got it.  Hold on.  I'll read it to you right now.  Oh, you got it, too.  I know Bonnie, too.  We do know Bonnie.  Fran.  Don't call her Bonnie.  I don't even know Fran.  Of course, you want to know the truth?  I never knew this.  She is so fucking forgettable.  Hold on.  It says Dice Clay refuses to take picture with female comic. 
[02:36:00]  Alert the press.  Yeah, for her.  What?  I'm telling you, honestly, I know her.  She's joking.  That's not real.  Oh, then my mistake.  Maybe I had a peg drawing.  I'm just going to call a friend.  My hard feelings. 
[02:36:30]  I'm a bitchy fucking guy.  I'm a little misunderstanding.  Sometimes.  We got to have thrown a wrong suit.  I get that.  That happens sometimes.  What did that have to do with Vegas, though?  There's a leap there somewhere.  What she said is that I don't like a comedian.  Oh, you don't like it.  And you have female comedians.  In the meantime, Eleanor's open to me for the last five years already.  Right.  And how is your son?  Is he doing good stand-up for you?  Yes, but we weren't talking about that.  Shut up.  Just trying to catch up a little bit.  I know. 
[02:37:00]  I just got to calm down because Norton gets me all wound up.  Oh, is that what it is?  But I didn't mean to.  I was just trying to be helpful.  Oh, this guy friend, you know what?  Kidding or not, shut your fucking mouth.  Whoa.  In the meantime, I told her to take the fucking picture.  And she's sitting there all hurt like these dumb twats gang.  I wonder, I haven't seen Norton, I haven't seen Artie, you know, I haven't seen Trunk.  And, you know, I just wanted the guys.  Yeah, yeah.  And she's creeping in there to get her Twitter picture. 
[02:37:30]  Man.  Shuck my fucking dick, you won't open your mouth about me.  Oh, shit.  But reading that, though.  And I don't, but no, obviously.  Should we get Bonnie on the phone?  Is this a joke?  No, there's nothing to talk about.  Obviously, she was kidding.  All right, that's fine, yeah.  Yeah, all the guys are taking a picture at the wedding.  He's ready to light up, by the way.  No, I'm good.  You thought there was smoke that time.  He took a drag and he's like, fuck, still no smoke.  Don't push me into hell.  I don't want to be banned from another, I'm finally doing good after 150 years.  Fucking dropped a lot of weight. 
[02:38:00]  We're fucking special now.  Why?  What happened?  We're doing it in Chicago.  I think you got the information.  Yeah, because, you know, this is going to be.  I do.  It's the taping of his final stand-up special.  Why is it the final?  Well, I just look at it this way, because I'm doing a lot of stuff.  So I just really, I haven't done one in 16 years.  Have you not done a fucking special in 16 years?  In 16 years.  Wow.  Wow.  So I really want to bang people over the head.  I really worked and crafted it that people get some of the older hits, plus all this new  stuff I'm doing. 
[02:38:30]  I mean, Norton, Rogan, they all came to Vegas.  I got the okay from them.  Anthony was great.  Anthony was great.  Yeah, but I want to give, you know, once you give your best, I feel this will be my  most exciting special, having LA Rocks open for me, Max and Dylan, you know, and just  really giving, it's going to end New Year's Eve on Showtime, and I wanted to do it in a  place, you know, that would be great to do it, like Boston.  It was going to be Boston first, now it's Chicago, because in Boston, they were breaking 
[02:39:00]  balls with all, you know, nine fire departments, got to be, I'm going, we're going to blow  some smoke that comes out.  That's why I didn't shoot in Boston.  The same fucking reason.  Assholes.  I couldn't do it, and I got a show to produce here.  I got a show to put on.  What, synthetic smoke?  They don't allow.  And this is what the great fucking thing.  It's the same reason I moved.  Is that why you didn't do it?  It was Boston first, Cleveland second choice.  I went to Cleveland.  Fuck Boston.  So I'm going to do it in Chicago on August 25th. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  You know the name of the place you have it there?  The Arcata?  Arcata?  The Arcata?  Arcata Theater in St. Charles, Illinois.  Two shows, 7 and 9, 30.  I thought it was Chicago.  It's right outside.  It says Chicago.  I'm walking.  That's Chicago.  It is.  Pretty much, yeah.  I swear.  Tickets on sale tomorrow.  I swear, it's Chicago.  Tickets on sale tomorrow, Arcata.  It's not that big a room.  It's only like 1,200 seats.  But, you know, it's enough to, you know, make it look nice on TV.  But all I really care about with the special is the annihilation of the crowd. 
[02:40:00]  You know what I mean?  I just really want to come over and bang them over the fucking head that they're choking on their own laughs.  And, you know, in a day and age where it is, you know, hard to still shock and make people, you know, you know what I mean, Norton.  You know, where everything's been said.  I still have the ability to offend and hurt and have people still walking out and going, what kind of show is it? 
[02:40:30]  The show you shouldn't be at, you straight-laced piece of shit.  Take a cop cup, you fucking asshole lips once in a while.  Let me tell you something, Dice.  When I saw you at the Riviera, I saw a show where, in this day and age, everyone's politically correct.  It's very hard to say a lot of things.  It's fucking awful what's going on.  Dice, though, said, fuck it.  He will say anything.  Use the most offensive words that people don't use in this day and age.  What was the bit he was doing?  At one point, I actually said, we were laughing.  I said to Anthony, he's just a fucking pig. 
[02:41:00]  That fucking killed me.  Because I was cracking up.  I was cracking up.  And then Jimmy says that, and I'm like, yes.  I forget what you were doing.  It was just such a dirty bitch.  It might be the designer of the asshole lip.  It might.  Because everything is a style today.  So now they even, you know, with that new book, Fifty Shades of Granted, all these fucking slobs are eating.  Which I love.  You know, when I call women pigs today, I don't mean it as an insult. 
[02:41:30]  It's a compliment.  You know what I mean?  You're in bed with a chick, and your fucking balls are banging against a wet, sticky, fucking munchy box, right?  What are you going to say to her?  Oh, this is nice?  Oh, you fucking slob.  You fuck so fucking good.  I wish I had ten fucking gallons of cum just to drown you in.  You know?  When it's that fucking good.  I told you he's a romantic.  I told you.  My favorite line is, I'm not going to blow a joke, but it's... 
[02:42:00]  What's it about, I'll tell you, because I could always...  It's fucking about, like, you didn't cum last time.  It was something about cum...  Oh, no, don't do that joke.  Yeah, I won't.  It's too powerful.  It's something about cumming on a girl.  It's just...  It's powerful.  I saw, speaking of being politically...  Well, you know, when you...  But, you know, these chicks today, when you come over, you know what I mean?  They expect a load in the face.  You don't give a chick a load in the face.  You want to know something?  That's why I compare, like, yesterday to today, because they think if you're not doing that  to them, you don't really like them. 
[02:42:30]  You know what I mean?  You know, it's like a guy that's married in the middle of the day.  If he goes, honey, sit down, I got something for you, and just fucking takes a...  Right in a fucking yapper.  He's going to get so many guys punched today.  And you go, you know what, honey?  It's not even nighttime yet.  That's how much I'm digging you.  You got your first load.  You didn't put anything in the oven yet.  See?  I'm not even taking you to Fatburger.  Because that's what they all look like after a year.  Guys are going to get punched today, following your advice. 
[02:43:00]  Speaking of his act, speaking of his act, he did this...  Keep eating ranch dressing.  Go ahead.  Keep eating ranch dressing.  We've got to bring something in, because it's melting.  Can you hold that thought?  I'm just getting the salad.  Yeah, with a ton of ranch dressing to slap onto your fat ass and legs.  You realize it's Jim Norton's birthday today, right, Dice?  Why do you think I'm here?  All right.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, shit.  Oh, thank you.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  Hello, madam.  Yeah.  It's melting.  Oh, okay.  It's melting because you're carrying it, baby. 
[02:43:30]  I tell you that much right now.  Looks like the inside of my boxers.  Get the bun out of your head.  Do me a favor.  You don't like that?  What's that?  No, I mean, look at her.  She's all beautiful.  This is what I'm saying, but she got the bun.  She got a knot.  Dice doesn't like the hair up, is what he's saying.  No, we just had a whole discussion about it.  I mean, you're a beautiful girl and everything.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm going for the Robert Palmer look.  Well, don't.  Do myself a favor.  You know what I mean?  Let the hair hang down.  You know what I mean? 
[02:44:00]  Next thing you know, you're in a bar with some new guys.  We've got to get her mic on this.  She's lovely.  She's very nice.  Thank you, miss.  Happy birthday.  Oh, you don't know her, Norton?  No.  No, we've never met.  Well, say something to her.  What's your name?  I'm Adrian.  Oh, with Rocky.  Oh, that's a good one.  I didn't know he was at home.  That's a great pickup line.  I hear it all the time, so it's fine.  Oh, okay.  Where are you from?  From New York.  No, I mean a club or something?  Yeah, I'm from HQ's.  I'm on Dennis Rodman's topless basketball team, so.  Oh, no. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  You ever banged Dennis?  No.  Was you?  Never.  Business and pleasure are different.  It should be about you and her.  Forget about her.  I want something to jerk off too later.  That's brilliant.  And the idea of her and Dennis.  We're going to be having a show in Vegas.  Like, that's where we're going to be based on it, so.  Can we see what Dennis saw in you?  Yeah.  We didn't see anything yet, so.  Have you given him a lap dance before, Dennis?  No.  Did you just get on the team?  Excuse me?  Did you just get on the team?  No.  No.  We've been promoting it for, like, four months, so.  It's topless basketball. 
[02:45:00]  It's been on the Post.  It's been on the Today Show, so.  Okay.  That's cool.  See, I'd go to that.  I don't go to regular basketball games, but I'd go to that.  You've got to go to that.  I don't go to that.  I don't go to that.  I don't go to that.  I don't go to that pitch.  You know what I mean?  All that helmet pitching in the.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, it sells.  Yeah, yeah.  You want some?  No, thank you.  I really shouldn't.  What is it?  Ice cream cake?  Yeah, it's fucking good.  Ice, you can't.  Are you going to be topless?  I mean, you play basketball?  You know what?  I can't have that.  No, it's too early.  Obviously.  Should we?  Ice. 
[02:45:30]  No topless?  I don't know.  I'd love to see topless.  Yeah, come on.  Come on.  Throw one out there.  Come on.  We'll get a basketball.  We'll get a basketball.  You know what?  You know what?  Throw one out there.  I'll take my dick out.  What do I care?  Thin the lights a little.  Give it a little music.  Let's calm this situation down a little bit.  Yeah, what if we get your basketball?  You see what I mean?  You want a girl to just walk into the office over here.  You got the lights on like you're doing surgery.  Everything is lighting.  That's how I came up with the lava lights. 
[02:46:00]  The LCD lights in the closet.  What's better than that?  Dice.  Well, you want to look good in bright light.  You don't want to look good in dark.  Let's lower the voices.  Let's see what happens here.  All right.  So look at me, honey.  What do you got going on over there?  Look at me.  Talk to Dice.  It's about your birthday.  Where are you going?  That's not how you say it.  Where are you going, baby?  Yeah, that's right.  Where are you going, madam?  Oh, no.  That isn't it either.  Where are you going?  Something.  How did you get recruited for this? 
[02:46:30]  I'm friends with the owner that owns HQs.  Microphone.  I'm friends with the owner that owns HQs, and he's best friends with Dennis.  So he's, like, introduced me to Dennis and the Dennis.  I mean this gig, bringing in the cake.  Yeah.  How'd they convince you?  Oh, um, just the publicist and just...  So you get a free plug for Toppers.  But just put...  Where's this cake?  She didn't care.  She didn't care.  I don't know.  See, when they just throw the hair in the bun, Anthony, they're not caring. 
[02:47:00]  Right, right, right.  If she really cared about Norton and his birthday, the hair would be down.  The down hair.  You know what I mean?  You walk in a certain way.  I hear you.  It's like, here, big boy, all of a sudden, he's popping wood.  And everybody goes, I'm a winner.  I hear you.  So you don't think she would go on a first date with her hair in a bun?  Yeah, if you went on a first date, would you wear your hair in a bun?  No.  Um, it depends.  No, don't bullshit.  I have a beautiful face, so why does it matter if I have short hair or whatever?  Because women... 
[02:47:30]  I'm being honest.  And I agree with the beautiful face.  Thank you.  That's why I'm saying God gave you the beautiful...  I have a beautiful hair to let down to make the guys...  But then if I wear my hair down, then you can't see other things, and it's just...  Well, we're not going to see anything anyway.  What can I see?  The back of your neck?  I'll get to that later.  That's the fun.  You've got to move it out of the way, and then you just chomp it.  Oh, my God.  You know what I mean?  Like a leech hooking on.  You know what I'm saying?  You know, romance stuff.  No winners here today, Dice. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, there's no winners here today.  She's not going to do nothing for him.  I don't think so.  But she's not a stripper.  We know that.  But...  No?  You know, when you're playing on top, it's in front of a hole.  If you have a basketball floor.  You have a dance floor?  So, wait, yeah.  Who got you to bring me a cake?  Like, where'd the cake come from?  Who brought the cake in?  I made the cake.  Something about a cake?  Get rolling.  Yeah.  Roland set this up.  Who brought the cake in?  Roland got a girl.  Yeah, Roland.  Get in here.  That's crazy.  My friend here, Jim Florentine, he's getting married.  Maybe you could do a little dance for him, like a little bachelorette thing.  Yeah, because I didn't have a bachelor party.  Yeah, so he's married, but it's not, like, in a week yet, so... 
[02:48:30]  So, who had...  I'm sorry, Andrew.  How did we work this out?  Who's the kid?  Yeah, what happened, Roland?  She brought the cake.  No, I brought the cake.  Thank you, Roland.  I went all the way down to the east side to get...  Thank you very much.  What's up with her?  She doesn't want to...  We have no winners here today, Roland.  How did you recruit...  How did you get a girl for this?  Yeah, we have no winners.  No winners.  Oh, okay.  You what?  Oh, Lainey.  Yeah.  Oh, I love Lainey.  She's outside.  Oh, okay.  Lainey probably didn't choose to know.  Lainey usually gets someone that will make winners. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  I can't believe he's a birthday boy today.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Yeah?  It doesn't always feel good when it's your birthday.  I want to blow my brains out.  I hate my birthday.  What?  Really?  Oh, boy.  Well, she's a woman.  Oh, where are you going?  Oh, my gosh.  I'm trying to make a sneak run.  No, there you go.  Let it go.  No, let it go.  Let it go.  Yeah, we don't need it.  She don't want to.  No, let it go.  You know, I don't beg for it.  There she goes.  I ain't going to beg for it.  Yeah, right.  Why do we do that?  You have that nice...  You like that thick look.  Get Lainey in here.  Let's run Lainey for them. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, bring Lainey in.  You know what I liked about it?  You know what I liked about it?  She had some mass.  She was sexy, but...  I don't know if she was.  You know what I mean?  I like a chick with a little mass.  Hi, Lainey.  That's a lot of mass.  Thank you.  Lainey, we're disappointed in your choice today.  That girl was awful.  She was cute, but she wouldn't even take her top off.  She's going to play topless basketball.  In front of a crowd.  Yeah.  Probably because she dances...  You send it to a whole world of human beings, and then you don't, you know, drop a tit  on the table.  Probably because she...  It's a birthday.  She dances at headquarters, so she probably wants people to come into headquarters and see 
[02:50:00]  her in their lives.  Anybody go see her there after that horrendous...  There's six guys in here.  Here's a cake.  I'm leaving.  She didn't have to...  Here's a cake.  I'm leaving?  Yeah, it was awful.  She wouldn't even show her breasts.  You know what?  Some of these chicks get intimidated until they're actually bouncing up and down on your  cock.  It's like everybody loosens up when that's happening.  I don't think that was it, though.  No, it wasn't.  She just...  They just came in.  We failed Jim Norton today.  You know what?  She did it like...  No, you didn't.  You did not fail me.  She did.  You know what you're saying, Norton?  She did it like it was just the job.  I've had people fucking... 
[02:50:30]  No, she was excited to see you.  She wasn't excited.  She actually was looking up all your stuff online, Jimmy.  My doctor was sexier when she fucking told me I had herpes.  No.  Well, you know, I got a beautiful...  You know, I love when they get that, like when you're going out, you know, and they go,  well, she's got a nice face.  I go, for what?  Punching?  You know what I mean?  Don't tell me I'm nice.  I'm seeing your fucking face.  Draw your tits out there.  Make an event happen. 
[02:51:00]  Draw your tits out there.  We said, well, she's very pretty.  She didn't want to show her breasts.  We tried.  Very pretty.  But she didn't want to show her breasts.  And then we're like, did you ever dance?  And she's like, well, I have.  Duck mouth.  Like, ugh.  Yeah.  It's like when you're banging the chick in the ass.  I thought she was sexy, but...  You're banging the chick in the ass, right?  And she's going like this.  I used to be really good at this.  Oh, my God.  She's probably so intimidated by you.  She's not intimidated.  No, she just was one of those...  She didn't want to be here.  She didn't want to be here.  She didn't want to be here.  I know one thing that doesn't intimidate her.  Donuts.  If you guys want to see a girl who will not take her top off, feel free to go to that 
[02:51:30]  club and watch her.  Lainey's usually really good for us.  I am.  You really are.  I am.  But, you know, she's a dancer.  But go get another one.  Go on.  Go on.  Get somebody else now.  But that's why we never...  I mean, I love Lainey.  Get another birthday treat for him.  But that's why we don't take dancers.  That's why we don't have them come in, because they always pull that shit.  The dancers do.  It's not like we wanted to touch her or anything.  Let me suck your...  None of that stuff.  We just want to see her tits.  But, like, you're going to play topless basketball.  And you won't show your tits in a room full of... 
[02:52:00]  You know what I mean?  True to fucking viewers.  What the fuck do you think you're doing in here?  Exactly.  Because you're so fucking smart.  You know what I miss the most at moments like this?  Patrice O'Neal.  Oh, would he have been a treat with that?  Yeah.  Oh, he'd have laid out the scenario perfectly.  That's why we don't like dancers.  I don't think she's probably used to this.  She's going to play nude basketball for Dennis Robin.  Of course she's used to it.  I think it was her first time on national radio.  It doesn't matter.  It's free now, though.  It doesn't matter.  Listen to me. 
[02:52:30]  Go out there.  You've got a whole floor full of chicks sitting around playing with a computer.  Go find another one.  Go make some calls.  Throw one in here.  They flash the tits.  Everybody goes home a winner.  That's why we never...  We love lenders.  This is the L.P. and Anthony show.  We never take dancers.  That's why.  Exactly.  They always do shit like that.  They always do that.  I don't like that.  What do you mean you don't want to?  Why?  I'm not going to grab you?  That's why I never even got into going to strip clubs.  Because I know it's just all a fucking show.  It's all a game.  You know what I mean?  They come in there, they give the fake seduction, and it's not interesting. 
[02:53:00]  No, no, not at all.  Not fucking interested.  I want a real hoer that really likes opening her fucking legs and just right to your fucking  yam bag, you fucking pig, what you are.  Somebody that cares about what happens.  Lainey, thanks for putting your hair down today.  Yeah.  Unlike your friend.  Not here.  It's $1,500 in your right tit.  I love you guys.  I'm sorry.  I'm disappointed.  Now I sit on my break.  It was awful, but it's not your fault.  Jimmy, I'll make it up to you next time.  You don't owe me anything.  I'll do it now. 
[02:53:30]  Do it now.  You don't owe me anything.  When are you going to make it up?  Thank God his birthday's every day.  I woke up for this.  Thank God for that.  I woke up.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  We failed you.  You didn't fail me.  If you guys want to go watch a girl who won't take her top off, go to the club and watch  her.  I'm sure she's terrific.  Look at the anger.  I'm sure she'll take her top off.  That's literally like me getting hired for a fucking ... They're saying, hey, could  you go in and tell a joke to someone, and me walking in and go, yeah, you know, this  Zimmerman thing is really sad, and turning around and walking out.  Right.  That's the fucking equivalent of me refusing to do a joke. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Jim, don't you tell jokes?  Well, I have.  Blah, blah, blah.  And it's not like she's retired.  She's going to be in front of crowds topless.  She's got to play topless basketball.  Maybe if you guys eased into it a little bit.  We did.  That's what he's supposed to do.  We did.  How is Dennis Rodman going to ease into it?  You've got to warm her up a little bit.  Take your tits out and make a jump shot.  How is she easing into it?  Where's she now?  I don't know.  She wasn't embarrassed with that gut.  I would figure crying.  I thought she was very afraid.  Did she flee the building of no rules?  I was attracted to her.  Or no laws.  What's no laws? 
[02:54:30]  The building has no laws.  The building of no laws.  Duck Bill Mouth.  No, Dice likes that.  I was attracted to her physically.  He didn't like the thick look on that.  I was attracted to her.  It bothered me because a thick girl shouldn't have her hair tied up to a fucking knot.  It wasn't even a bun.  It's worse.  It's a different level when it's a knot.  The knot just says, I don't give a fuck.  That wasn't a bun.  It was a knot.  You're right.  To make a living, she's got to jump up and down with her tits bouncing like on a trampoline.  Right.  You wear her hair down. 
[02:55:00]  You go to a bar on a Saturday night.  Some sucker's going to pick you up, start lacing you with his load.  Dude, next thing you know, you're married with three fucking kids.  Yeah, them what?  Your hairs in a knot, you're on a basketball court going, look at my dopey tits.  Look at my personality, my tits fucking...  White strippers suck.  I tell you, black or Spanish girls are the best.  Black or Spanish, always.  Always go with the ethnic.  Hold on, Sam has something.  We got an update.  We're doing some eavesdropping.  What happened?  Well, I would have if they weren't so rude. 
[02:55:30]  That's bullshit.  That's always a great excuse.  We've been at this game for a long time.  That is such bullshit.  He's been at this game for a long time.  Dice fucking lowered his voice and was a gentleman.  He's being playful.  I love my voice because he's been doing this.  You are a gentleman, Dice.  You are a fucking gentleman.  Everybody was.  You even got in Dice Clay.  What are you saying to Dice?  We even turned the lights down.  I think you guys are referring to Dice.  This is a comedy show.  Can we bring her back in to Dice?  This is a comedy show.  She wasn't doing it anyway. 
[02:56:00]  Kenny's got intel.  Hold on.  What happened, Kenny?  She might have been insulted by the bun comments.  Too bad.  She's still out there.  You want to make nice with her?  You want to know something?  Let's make nice with her.  I'm not the one that told her to go in the bedroom and put your hair in a fucking knot.  That's right.  Can you make nice with her?  I have no problem.  Why does it make nice?  Let's make nice with her.  Why am I the problem all the time?  Dice wants to make nice with her.  All right.  Come on.  I think this will work out well. 
[02:56:30]  He's got a point, though.  Oh, wait.  Roland's just making a face.  What happened, Roland?  The cake was good, Roland.  Thank you.  Yeah.  But you let us all down.  Yeah.  No, Roland never lets anyone down.  That's haunted.  Where is she?  Are they gone?  Let's make nice.  We don't want her to leave.  Where is she?  Where is she?  Tell her Dice wants to make nice.  Yeah.  We don't want to leave.  Come on.  Plus, it's my birthday.  I wasn't rude to her.  I was very nice to her.  We still got a chance to get winners here.  I'm the one who's nice to girls in here.  Of all the guys in here, I'm the nicest to chicks, and they treat me like shit. 
[02:57:00]  Fuck them.  My strippers stink.  You didn't even look at it.  That's why I like trannies.  I should have just thought that and not said it.  I kind of thought it might have been.  You started eating the cake.  You didn't even pay attention.  It was melting.  I was being a gentleman.  I was trying to help you.  Someone left the cake out in the rain.  I don't think that I could make it.  And it took too long to bake it.  I never had that recipe again.  No, but that was a gentlemanly thing to do.  Like, hey, I'm not making an object out of you. 
[02:57:30]  I'm enjoying a piece of birthday cake.  Thank you very much.  We were easing into it, but at least look at her tits now and then.  She feels good about it.  That's what I fucking mean.  She's probably got them big cow nipples.  You know what I mean?  Yes, I do.  I love that shit.  I do, too.  Let's smooth things off.  Big Polish tits.  Instead of when they're like little men nipples.  Yeah, I like big tits.  Like a fucking cow when they hang there.  Yeah.  Ugh, shit.  Just splooge up.  Yeah, fuck.  Yeah, big Polish tits.  Who's better than you?  Could you get her in here? 
[02:58:00]  We got to smooth things over.  No, no, no.  I just want to apologize.  Let's turn the lights down.  Yeah, let me.  Let's turn down the surgery lights.  All right.  Let's do it.  Let's be romantic.  Maybe she took her hair out of the bun.  What's her name again, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Let's make nice.  Yeah, okay.  Let's move things over with the headquarters, girl.  Florentino, like, introduces us.  I'm sure it's a great club at all.  I'm just meeting her.  What's her name?  We'll start it all over.  Fran.  Joanna.  Okay.  Fran.  Fran.  Everyone's Fran.  All right, the lights are down, Dice.  So, let's make nice.  We got a chance to get winners here.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Where is she?  What you went? 
[02:58:30]  Now what?  Now what?  She's making a shit.  Dice, don't get...  Dice.  Be patient.  I'm just fucking sweating it.  Be patient, Dice.  I can't smoke, but now it's like a ventilation problem.  Here she comes.  Here she comes.  Here she comes.  You ready for this?  You good?  Okay.  Everybody be cool.  All right.  Dice cool.  Dice cool.  Dice cool.  Remember, I like Dice cool.  Yeah, I know Dice cool.  Dice cool.  Remember.  Hi.  There it is.  Sure.  Look at...  Look at...  She got headphones or something?  A thump-thin.  Somebody have headphones.  Joanna.  This is my friend Andrew over here. 
[02:59:00]  Andrew, this is Joanna.  Listen.  Listen.  I'm sorry, what?  Over your fucking head.  I'm trying to be Joanna.  It was Joanna.  He told me your name was Joanna.  It's Fran.  Oh, Fran.  Fran, I'm sorry.  We fucked you.  Adrian.  Adrian.  Remember?  Don't be an idiot.  He told me it was Joanna.  I told you it was Adrian.  I'm not Russian.  Sorry.  He did that.  We knew it was Adrian.  It's Adrian like Rocky.  We knew it was Adrian.  We knew that.  What's her first name?  Adrian.  Adrian.  It's Adrian, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Look. 
[02:59:30]  My friends were a little out of line before.  You know what I mean?  Something.  You know, they sort of put the pressure on me to talk about the bun because they know  I have a thing about that.  I lost many girlfriends over, you know, when they would screw up and go into the bathroom  and put their hair in a knot.  Because it's, you know how, like, you could look all beautiful and go into the bathroom  like Marilyn Monroe and then Marilyn Manson walks out.  You know how that happens?  So when I see a bun, when I see a bun, I get flashbacks of this stupid fuck and I warned 
[03:00:00]  her.  You know, I would say to her all the time, I go, what's with the fucking knot?  Yeah.  Well, I'm washing my face.  You know what?  Don't wash your face.  You put the makeup on your face for a reason.  Yeah.  So you look like a human being.  That's fuckable, right?  And now you come out of there, no fucking makeup.  A bun in your hair.  You look like my eight-year-old kid.  You know what I mean?  So maybe it was my fault, sweetheart. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  See, Dice is apologizing.  It is Norton's birthday.  Maybe I was a little out of line.  Like earlier, I had a fight with Franny, you know, and that was a misunderstanding.  You know what I mean?  So now take your dress off or something for Norton.  It's my birthday and stuff.  It is his birthday.  Okay.  No, no.  I don't even want her to take her top down.  That's fucking wrong of you guys. 
[03:01:00]  You know what I mean?  I mean, we're in a fucking radio state.  Even if she got undressed.  Yeah.  What's the fucking thrill with nine guys standing around computers?  It's going to get weird real fast.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like everybody's going to make an excuse to leave or something.  Yeah.  A chick like this.  You get alone.  You get it like in a bathroom where there's nobody hanging out.  A bathroom.  No bathroom.  Well, because we're in a no-law building.  You know, you lock the door.  You get her in a corner a little.  You go, let me see over here now. 
[03:01:30]  You know, putty, putty, putty.  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  Nice.  But Dice, we're confused by the topless basketball thing.  Right.  That was a confusing part.  We're very confused.  We thought if you did topless basketball.  Why not?  And you had danced before.  Be topless for Jim Norton's birthday.  Like that.  You could be topless for Jim Norton's birthday.  Yeah, that's the whole thing.  But it's the whole principle of how you ask somebody and don't be rude about it.  That's right.  Oh.  Be respectful.  Be like, oh, I would love to see your great big boobs.  Don't be like, hey, like you're the, you know what I mean?  I love you, though. 
[03:02:00]  Who did that?  Who did that?  Who did that?  A little bit of this, a little bit of that.  Who did that?  There's a few of us.  What did I say?  Yeah.  What did he say?  It's just people's mannerisms.  You know what I mean?  What did I do?  Well, his mannerisms were okay.  It's the way you talk to people.  What did I do?  You're not being very nice.  I didn't even realize that he was rude, too, right?  I was very polite eating my birthday cake or something.  What did I say?  I want to see some pussy.  What did I say?  No, no.  Stop.  It's just like the way you talk to people.  My cock's so hard.  Agent, who was the rude one?  Was it Anthony or was it my friend over here? 
[03:02:30]  I'm just saying in general.  When you want something from somebody, be nice.  My money used to say, Chippa, don't be rude.  She didn't say it was you.  You know what it is, Ethel?  I feel like I'm being accused.  I keep forgetting what it is.  I got to say a name to know it.  What's her name?  What is your name?  Adrian.  Just call me Ethel.  No, Adrian's okay.  Why'd you tell me Ethel?  I was sticking to my aunt.  It's Joanna.  It's like, it doesn't matter.  Do any of my mannerisms come off as offensive or something?  He gets told that a lot, though, because when girls come late... 
[03:03:00]  I do not.  He behaves rudely.  No, you know what it is.  I don't think I did.  You know what it is.  Are you looking up my...  Yes, I am.  See, is that rude?  Why else are you in here?  Is that rude?  No, because I acknowledged it and he answered correctly.  You know, but the thing is, I'm a guy and she's got very lovely legs.  You know what?  And I was thinking in her underpants.  Yeah, why is she laughing at that?  Of course you are.  Even if she showed a beautiful...  I'm boggled here.  ...Buxoms.  You're a rude guy.  Even if she showed the Buxoms...  Why don't we just play strip poker and just play...  We don't want a game. 
[03:03:30]  We just want you to take your shot off.  Oh, I'll show my penis, but nobody wants to see it.  It looks awful right now because I have to tinkle.  Ew.  Yeah, I know.  What's it doing?  It's like a twisted pigtail.  It's not good.  But I mean, I would...  Not that nobody wants to see it, but...  No winners.  Are your feet dirty?  No winners.  Because Dice doesn't like dirty feet.  No, she's got clean feet.  I can see it right from the get-go.  That isn't an offensive thing.  We were talking about her earlier.  Do you have dirty feet?  No, no, no.  She really doesn't like Anthony.  I don't know.  Damn it.  I'm just asking her. 
[03:04:00]  Well, you're covering them up and it's 100 degrees.  She's got a good point there.  Come on in.  You got it in here.  No, I have.  I always feel like...  It's 100 degrees and you're covering your tits up.  Oh, I came in here with an open shirt.  That's not how you talk to a lady.  What the fuck do you want?  Oh, wow.  Almost clean.  We want to see, as Dice is calling them, your big cow nipples.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  I was just making a statement about the female. 
[03:04:30]  Do you guys have never seen big boobs before?  No.  Yeah, right?  What have you never?  But you don't even know.  But we've also had pizza before.  You know what?  It doesn't stop us from having more pizza.  That's what you guys do with girls with growing boobs in B ranges.  In your normal, personal life.  Well, usually they're A cups.  You know, they haven't gotten them yet.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You know, the little A cups.  Why?  You don't think small-breasted women are attractive at all?  You know, I am doing a club tonight.  I've never had small boobs.  I don't know what that feels like.  No.  Shut your mouth a minute when I'm talking. 
[03:05:00]  Dice is performing tonight at Governors in Leavittown, Long Island.  Two shows, 8 and 10, 30.  Well, what I'm saying is, maybe Alexandra here could be sitting in the front row.  I could say something about, you know, the cow nipples.  Right, right, right.  And I'll really make it up to you because I'm a Megatron star and people will listen to me.  And if I say, you know, go see Joanna.  No.  I don't know.  She's lying to me about her name.  Adrian.  Adrian.  And, you know, at the basketball, her and Rodman will be topless. 
[03:05:30]  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  Maybe Rodman's got to ask nice.  Has Rodman got to ask nice?  Everyone probably does, right?  It's a business.  Like, I mean.  What is this?  A fucking playroom?  This is a business, too.  We conduct business here.  It's a radio show.  Well, you guys, like, aren't my teammates or aren't my coach?  But we're here promoting something that you want to promote.  Like, it's a real game.  It's quid pro quo.  Well, if you're not basketball, it's like I play somebody one-on-one. 
[03:06:00]  Do you live out on the island?  Yeah.  Literally tit for tat.  You live in the city.  I live, like, right around here.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, right in the city.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Not in Long Island, not in Queens, not in Brogs, but in the city.  Nothing's wrong.  Well, I'm out in Long Island.  If you want it, you'll come hunt me down.  So how many guys faces the app to shove those tits in to afford a place in Manhattan?  And that's it.  That's a nice.  That's what I'm talking about right now.  Because when I get on stage and I do my thing, and I go into my routine, the crowd goes out 
[03:06:30]  of that fucking mind, and that's the kind of show I like to deliver to people.  Some people just want to, like, some people.  Oh, shit.  I'm the type of comic that doesn't come on and give them everything to your tits.  Well, I'm wearing a dress that explodes it.  No one goes through my fucking targets.  I annihilate the fucking audience.  They just don't.  Guys want to see your tits.  Oh, man.  You want to see your tits with the style, and that's what's going to happen at the show  at Covenants tonight.  Bravo.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Hey, what were you saying?  No one heard. 
[03:07:00]  What happened to me?  I was just saying, I don't understand how she makes some money if she doesn't show her  tits.  No, but the whole thing is...  Some people don't want to be, like, all...  It's more like just talking, like, communication.  It's not about, like, all your fucking tits are enormous.  Do you think guys go, let me go to the strip clubs to communicate and talk?  How many of you guys watched porn before you came in here today?  It was four in the morning.  Yeah, it's a little early.  It would be a little early.  I'm just saying, when you go to a strip club, guys want to see tits.  They don't go there to talk.  Yeah, but we're not in the strip club now.  Some people do.  Some people need, like, companionship. 
[03:07:30]  They need friendship.  Anthony.  Anthony.  You don't know everybody.  And that's a fucking psychopath.  No, seriously.  You're not a psychopath, guys.  Anthony.  She's right, Anthony.  Some people go in there for companionship.  They do.  You're the one that was telling me I got to be nice and you're now...  Well, so he's asking me questions.  She started...  Stop with the high-pitched voice, Ethel.  She started shitting on me a little.  When they cut it at Octave where he told me, get out of the car, the relationship  is over.  I can't take that fucking shriek. 
[03:08:00]  Well, what's that for?  Well, my mother said your mother should fucking choke along with you, I'm thinking.  Oh, man.  That's fucked up.  I know.  Whose mother are you talking about?  That's fucked up.  I know.  I'm not talking about Ethel.  Oh, man.  I'm just saying, when women go to that shriek...  Yeah, I got you.  Well, just because you want to see the fuck you're doing next to me then.  So, what would we have had to have done so that you would have shown your lovely breasts  to Jim Norton on his birthday?  Everything differently.  Yeah.  What would we have had to have done? 
[03:08:30]  How did we make this grandiose mistake that your precious tits that everyone can see at  the club can't be shown in this environment?  Perish the fucking thought.  Oh, man.  Because it's the way that you talk to people.  People, like, when I'm working, they're not like, hey, like a jerk-off.  Because they know that nobody's going to do that.  Do you think all the guys that come and see you are respecting you and gentlemen?  No, they're fucking delusional.  I'm not delusional.  They're there to see your tits and ass. 
[03:09:00]  No, so I sometimes, you know, some guys just want to hang out there.  No, they don't.  I got it sold.  Fuck you guys.  You know what?  You're being a little too hard on her now.  No, I'm not.  I'm just being honest.  It shows...  It's a reality here for the gal.  This is like, you know what's going on between you and her?  What?  This matches the beginning of a relationship.  I don't think so.  It's a magic.  It's like in school.  Apple doesn't date.  It's like in school, like when you used to throw, like, rocks at the chick in the row  in front of you.  Throw rocks at the chick. 
[03:09:30]  That she would know.  What did that happen?  Dice Jesus.  Like that she would know you like her.  Right.  Yeah.  Because you're not throwing rocks at all the girls.  You're throwing rocks at the one you like.  Right.  She's the only girl.  And then, what are you throwing the rocks at me?  Next thing you know, it's a relationship.  She's very lovely, but it's not...  Yeah, so why don't you tell her what you're really feeling?  But it's not my...  She's not...  Anyone that knows my type, it's not my type.  He likes me.  What's your type?  What?  He likes what?  No, I like girls that are a little smaller. 
[03:10:00]  A little more natural.  Smaller how?  Smaller how?  Yeah, how?  Smaller body-wise.  What?  Okay.  I like a more slender gal.  What are you saying?  Playboy wouldn't be successful if all the girls unbuilt just like Anna Nicole Smith.  So, look how famous she became, guys.  But she didn't play.  No.  When she was in her prime, like, with Clayton.  Joanna.  Joanna.  Do you understand?  Like, you go to the Playboy Mansion, everybody looks like me.  Wow.  She's right.  She's right. 
[03:10:30]  Get the owner.  Let me say this about that.  Let me say this about that.  Whatever.  It's your...  Whatever you like.  Yeah, exactly.  You know?  I can't do that.  I'm not here because...  Look, I'm not bashing you.  I'm not bashing you.  I have plenty of guys.  Yeah.  I'm just saying, personally, we're trying to get a thing going here.  It's kind of rude, right?  No, I'm not being rude.  Wait, that's rude.  I'm sure I'm not in a long time.  That's what we're saying.  Yeah, no.  I'm a personality person anyway.  Personality mean you're going to get to the personal level. 
[03:11:00]  I have a really good personality.  When are we going to hear that?  Personality mean you're going to get to the personal level.  We got off on the wrong foot.  Because, quite frankly, you...  So now you're trying to get a one-up?  No, you copped a fucking attitude.  And you're ruining Jim Norton's birthday.  Her personality is nice.  Personality mean you're going to get to the personal level.  No, you copped kind of an attitude.  No.  I don't understand when a girl that dances and does topless basketball comes in and won't  show Jimmy her tits on his birthday.  But, you know what?  Since you don't like my body type, you should turn around and I'll show everybody else. 
[03:11:30]  Turn around.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Now we bring it up.  That's his second fucking grave.  No, you don't like my body type, so...  Man, it's a fair point.  That's a fair point.  Fair point, Anthony.  Fair point.  Anthony, you did this to you, my friend.  Fair point.  Fair point.  Fair point.  You did this to you.  I don't like a fucking 65 Rambler either, but I'm looking at you.  No, but just look at the small letter.  The foul language you're using at all.  Insulting her.  Beautiful physique.  Physique. 
[03:12:00]  Shit, I'm probably the only guy that's ever been honest to this fucking girl.  No.  I bet.  Listen to me.  If Anthony turns around, we could have some winners here.  We could have some winners here.  We could have some winners here.  I refuse to turn around.  I understand.  I'm not backing down, but you're going to cock-block the rest of us.  I understand why...  You're going to turn back around real quick.  You're a cock-blocker.  Yeah.  What?  So why wouldn't you show Jimmy your tits, though?  I don't get it.  Because you don't even like them anyway, so it's irrelevant.  Oh, wait a minute.  You see what Anthony?  It's my birthday.  I know I completely understand that, but I don't want to make somebody else feel uncomfortable. 
[03:12:30]  Wait, can I handle this a minute?  What happened, guys?  There were certain things you said that you step out of line.  You hear what you just said to me?  What happened?  You didn't even miss the come-on line.  You missed the whole fucking thing.  There was a come-on line there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're so angry and so want to see her beautiful McGuffys.  McGuffys?  Well, I'm trying to be nice, because we're on radio.  I've never heard that.  That when she finally says something...  Some of the classy guys that come there to talk to you, have you ever called them McGuffys? 
[03:13:00]  It's insane.  The wonderful gentlemen that are just there to chat and hold an interesting conversation  with you.  I didn't know what it goes on in those places.  What about politics?  Yeah.  No, my whole point is, I understand your body type.  I get it.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, with my motto.  But that's the thing.  I guarantee at the mansion, there's no bun.  Uh-huh.  There's no bun.  Yeah.  And you know it, and I know it.  So look at me a minute.  Buns or bun? 
[03:13:30]  No, no, no.  When you're up at that mansion...  Wow.  And I've only been up there for...  I actually met the girl I'm married to for the time being.  Uh-huh.  Up at the mansion, there was no bun.  Her hair was down to her ass, which led my eyes to her ass, and I said, done.  Yeah.  Done.  How often?  So you gotta wear the hair down at all times.  I'm your friend.  I'm trying to help you.  How often do you go to the mansion?  I could make this work with you and Anthony.  I've never been. 
[03:14:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  How do you know what goes on at the mansion if you've never been there?  Well, because of my girlfriend's room.  No, but you just said...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I went to school to become an attorney.  You said, when I'm up at the mansion, and all the guys...  No, I'm saying if you guys were to be up at the mansion, this is what you would  see.  No, no.  You said when you're up at the mansion.  How about a woman shun?  Oh, Jesus.  You said it.  Is it right or wrong?  Answer the question.  No, I did not say that.  The jury is listening.  No, I did not say that.  I did not say that.  Don't make me play the tape back.  Okay, you can play it back.  Don't make me play the tape back.  And even if you said when guys are up at the mansion, unless you physically saw them, 
[03:14:30]  you cannot make a statement like that.  What happened?  Yeah, you never been there.  You were talking yourself up right there, weren't you?  No, I'm just explaining girls in Playboy have this body type.  Yeah, they do.  And I agree with you.  That's what I said.  And if you were to go there, that's what you would say.  I didn't say I'd been there.  I've seen pictures from the mansion, and I've seen some slender gals there.  They're slender, and there's...  You know what I mean? 
[03:15:00]  You're making me think that I'm like...  Look, they got all kinds of shit walking around there.  They got chubby girls.  They got skinny, little, tall...  I didn't say...  You can throw whatever with me.  I'm talking to you.  Yeah, they didn't say that.  You can't throw whatever out.  But why are you so angry?  I'm not angry.  See, this is what I've learned through the years.  Again, I'm the only one being honest with this girl.  No one's fucking being honest here.  I'll be honest.  I love you.  Thank you.  You come in, you strip, you fucking play the topless basketball, but then you disrespect  Jimmy Norton when we ask nicely at first... 
[03:15:30]  The birthday boy.  ...to show your breasts to the lovely Jimmy Norton.  Look how sad Jimmy is.  Look how sad he is on his birthday.  He would have loved to have seen him.  Oh, no, he's right.  I mean, you were everything to him when you walked in here.  I felt like, wow, a very buxotic lady.  Yeah, and look what happened.  Yep.  Are they natural or did you have to buy self-confidence?  You know what?  You don't even need to go there with her.  What?  What happened?  Self-confidence?  I've always had big boobs.  I just wanted them bigger.  What nationality are you?  Personality?  You mean you've got to get a personal.  I'm going to get a little bit of Polish and something else. 
[03:16:00]  No.  What are you?  She's Italian.  No, I'm not either.  She's a blend.  I'm a blend.  No, but what?  Like Norwegian, that kind of stuff?  No, I'm Native American and Israeli.  What?  Fucking Indians, man.  I love Native Americans.  I love Native Americans.  Holy shit.  I have nothing left.  And the reason my hair isn't a bun is because my hair was just black and I'm going back  to blonde, so that's why.  Okay.  So why didn't you tell me that when I asked you a question?  Because you were like...  No, because everybody was yelling.  I was trying to talk to you.  That's why.  You know what I mean? 
[03:16:30]  Normally it's down and everything.  I mean, you know, you make a big deal out of yourself and that's good to have that kind  of self-confidence.  No, I'm not even kidding around.  Mm-hmm.  Dice.  And you get to have a conversation with Dice and you're playing with these fucking  yo-yos over here.  You know what I mean?  I know.  Hey, Tatanka.  You know what?  She's actually funny.  No, you're funny.  Was it your mother or father that was Indian?  Did you hear?  She just went like this and I know.  Your mom?  She's funny.  Leave her alone.  I know.  She's cool.  Let her go. 
[03:17:00]  If you want to ask her out, ask her out.  You're not asking anyone out.  Be nice.  Come on.  Be nice and sweet.  You know the fact that she put up and she went to war with the five of us in here.  How many other people could stay in here and put up your bullshit?  That's right.  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying-  Like how many women do you know that are witty and can give it back to you?  Well, we were-  No, no.  The witty thing didn't happen, but you did stand your ground.  We didn't go to jokes.  The wit didn't come out, but you had balls.  Oh, man.  I gotta respect that.  Yeah.  I'd like to see them.  You went up against them.  Anthony's hot. 
[03:17:30]  Look, I've had lots of fights with these guys.  Anthony's hot to go up against.  Nah, nah, nah.  And that's what's driving them a little crazy because-  Nah.  I could see what he likes.  I know.  Yeah.  You're not nice.  So just ask her.  Nah, I'm not gonna ask.  Ask her nice.  Just for the information.  Nah, I'm not gonna.  What, what?  Come on.  I know you like a little bit.  The digits?  The digits?  No, there's no digits.  You go talk to her outside.  I can see what's going on here.  You can't bullshit me.  Go get to dinner?  No.  No.  No.  What, you don't like them at all? 
[03:18:00]  Not good enough?  Come on.  How can you come back from that though?  Because, come back, that's the beginning of a relationship.  You know every relationship.  What, be a dick and then you think somebody's gonna go out to dinner with you?  That's crazy.  You know.  How old are you?  About 24?  Okay.  So, you know girls your age.  Look for the bad boy type.  He is a bad boy type.  That was the funniest thing Dice said.  You know what I mean?  24.  That's not, that's not, you see, he's still playing you.  No.  He's playing you.  Well, how old are you?  Uh, 51.  Well, you look good for your age.  Thank you, man. 
[03:18:30]  You see?  Let's try this.  You see?  Here we go.  No, I find older men attractive.  That's just nice.  I would never date anybody my age.  Nah, huh?  I'm 44.  So, now say something nice, Pat.  Yeah.  She just said something nice to you.  Well, she's very pretty.  Yeah.  Look how we don't want to give it up.  Why, why?  He's such a smooth talker.  Look how we don't want to give it.  He's playing the game.  What am I doing?  Come on.  You know what you're doing.  He's trying to get me nice, so I...  He's giving you the...  No, he wants a piece of you.  I could see it.  I don't...  What am I?  I could see it. 
[03:19:00]  You want a piece of her?  What?  Yeah.  He likes you.  Yeah, you're pretty quiet.  What are you doing over there?  You're taking away.  He's like Howard Stern.  Oh, damn.  Couple blocks away.  He hasn't said anything at all.  Listen to me.  You take her over to Patsy's for a glass of wine with Sinatra 8.  I actually need a shot of Patron.  You know what?  A shot of Patron.  This early?  Yeah.  That's lucky.  What do you want to do to yourself?  What do you want to do to yourself?  Adrian, why is he so quiet, that guy all the way in the corner?  Because he's observant.  Is it really...  But he's a closet like Naughty Boy. 
[03:19:30]  That's what it is.  Can you really drink at this time?  All right.  All right.  Can you really...  He's observant and like listens and then he's like, I know what you like, I'm gonna do it.  That just puts you up a notch though, the idea that you would drink at this hour.  I like that.  Hey, you might have misread this one actually.  Maybe I misread something there.  A few sit-ups and you'd be good.  Yeah.  So you gotta find out what a chick likes.  I like the idea of...  Patron, 10 in the morning.  I like the idea of drinking a little early.  I can't believe I'm awake.  I went to sleep at 8.30 in the morning and got up at 8.45.  I just like white breasts.  I like big nipples and big breasts. 
[03:20:00]  I like big nipples and big breasts.  I like big nipples and big breasts.  Because you have them.  There's no sleep involved.  Holy fuck.  Well, we're gonna see basketballs away.  I gotta plug fucking things up here.  I know.  We're the funniest guy in the world, man.  The funniest guy in the fucking world.  Please.  We gotta go back to work over here.  He lives in Long Island.  Is that a problem?  Wait, if Ant turns around, are we good?  Hey, Ant, you're in Long Island now. 
[03:20:30]  You bring her over to Governor's.  I drive myself.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to Governor's.  Dicey, I bring her to Governor's tonight.  I'm not going in.  I got a compound.  I got a cool movie theater bomb.  But he's talking.  How am I gonna do what I gotta do?  I got a fucking special I gotta talk about.  I got all kinds of...  I'm a fun dinner date.  Take three minutes to go, I like you.  Come out with me if things go real good.  Quack.  All right.  You know what I mean?  What if...  Jenny actually is a much better time out.  Yeah.  She wants to go out and have a good time.  She doesn't like me forever with Jimmy.  She has no interest in Jimmy. 
[03:21:00]  Why?  She doesn't like me.  I don't know why you don't like...  What did I do?  You're too nice, Jim.  You're too nice.  That's why.  You won't show Jimmy your tits.  You won't go out with them.  You know you're tight.  So she, if they...  You do the double dick.  I love Native American women, though.  I love Native American women.  They're my favorite women.  She already likes Anthony, so maybe she's got another Indian in the teepee.  She'll bring a walk for you.  You know what I mean?  You should grab a friend, you know, whatever.  Pokey, Pocahontas, whatever.  Come on.  You do like a double date, right? 
[03:21:30]  You got a lot of Indian friends.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Should Anthony turn around?  Let's have Anthony turn around.  That's what I get.  You see, I'll be...  The minute I act nice to somebody, shut up.  I hear you.  That's why I have no choice.  I got no...  You call those carrots?  Did you eat them?  What's that?  I don't even know.  You call those carrots.  Did you eat them?  You call those carrots.  Did you eat them?  Go inside.  Let's wrap up the situation.  What's going to happen here?  I don't know. 
[03:22:00]  Are we going to have winners?  You should go out with Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy would like that.  She doesn't like me though.  She doesn't like me at all.  Why don't you like Jimmy?  I'm okay with it.  No, I don't want to go out with anybody.  Why?  Do you have a boyfriend?  You don't?  No.  Do you go out on dates?  Why don't you like guys?  What happened?  Yeah, with guys?  What happened?  What happened?  Nothing happened.  I just...  I find like...  It's just sometimes a waste of time.  What do you mean?  Like this?  Like this?  A guy that's stuffing hundreds in your tongue,  there's no way to start a relationship. 
[03:22:30]  It's going to go sour.  I would never mix business and pleasure.  Even the guys that are just there to talk?  See, even when I'm at Governor's tonight,  I won't let anybody stuff money in my underwear.  That's good, Dice.  You know what I mean?  I stopped at doing it a long time ago.  Nice.  No, chicks, they do.  They really go fucking nuts for me.  It's amazing.  She just doesn't like the voice.  No.  You know what I mean?  You should like Jimmy.  He's a sweet boy.  We're going to...  What time is my first show tonight, by the way?  8 and 10.30.  8 and 10.30.  Two shows, Governor's.  When do I go on sale in Chicago?  Uh, tomorrow, Dice.  Tomorrow, right?  Yes. 
[03:23:00]  Saturday, August 25th.  Are you going to spray in my mouth?  Are you going...  Oh!  The mic's a little too close.  Excuse me.  Are those thong underpants?  Could I just ask?  Very sexy.  Thank you.  Could Jimmy see your ass?  He likes asses.  Give him a little something.  It's his birthday.  It's for Jimmy, not you guys.  Why are you benefiting from his birthday?  I won't look.  I won't look.  You know how when you're dancing around and a guy gives you money and there's other guys  sitting around him that also get to look a little bit?  That's kind of like what this is.  Yeah.  Jimmy...  But then they want me after the guy...  I don't.  I don't. 
[03:23:30]  You can count me out.  Trust me.  My wife's still in the hotel room with her legs up in the air just waiting for me to  come back.  Sounds like a good time.  It is a good time.  I'd love to see it.  That's why it works.  Trust me.  You would love to see it.  I'd love to see it.  Fucking Latin...  Nobody fucks like a Latin chick, honey.  You might be cute, but you can't fuck like her.  Oh, man.  Trust me on that.  It's whole line love for a reason there, sweetheart.  That's right.  Oh.  No, the American Indians.  That's right.  I get right in there.  You've never had an Israeli chick?  She's Israeli, too.  Israelis are crazy.  Yes.  They're a little wild, Israelis. 
[03:24:00]  You know why?  I give that a shot.  Do you say Israeli so you don't have to say Jewish?  It's morning.  Is it just Jewish or you're Israeli?  No, she's Israeli.  You know why I know?  It's different.  Because she don't know when to shut her fucking mouth that she keeps going on.  They're bossy.  They push you around.  Yeah.  That's what they fucking do.  They are a pushy people.  It's a lot like my wife.  My wife's Latin.  They love to fucking boss you around.  But you love it.  That's why you're still with her.  Exactly.  I don't mind that because I'm very confident.  Because you're like that in your normal life and she's like... 
[03:24:30]  You know what it is?  I'm a very confident man in my life that that's a true thing about me.  Nice does have confidence.  There's one thing about me.  I'm very confident.  You know?  But it's good to have somebody be confident and overpowering to you because you're like  that every day in your life.  But yeah.  So it's nice when I let her drive.  You know what I mean?  Drive the car.  Drive something else.  She could drive my cock into the fucking bed.  I get that.  Sure.  But I let her do other shit.  You know?  You want to drive me to your fucking Starbucks? 
[03:25:00]  You go ahead.  I sit like that there when I go like that.  That's nice of you.  You're a nice guy.  You're a sweetheart.  I like that.  A great man told me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A chick that takes you to the Starbucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear me.  Is a wonderful girl.  That man was my Uncle Anthony.  And I remember that day like yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Yeah.  And with that, I guess it's over. 
[03:25:30]  Pretty funny.  What's over?  I don't think this happened.  I got to talk about a special.  I got to talk about gigs.  Yeah.  You all right?  Yeah.  I'm just listening.  Oh.  You okay though?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Are we cool?  Take her outside already and talk to her.  I want to make sure we're cool though.  I'm sure everybody will be different when they don't have a microphone.  That's right.  That's exactly the same.  It's called show business, baby.  It's called show business.  It's called show business.  It's called show business.  Real show business.  Show business.  I guess there's no surprise for Jim Norton.  None.  That was very nice to her.  She just doesn't like it. 
[03:26:00]  I know.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  We failed you.  What time are you guys going to stay on until today?  Until she shows her tits.  No.  It's not going to happen.  Oh, man.  You keep looking over there.  It's okay.  Lainey, what's the matter?  Lainey, what's the matter?  If it's not going to happen, it's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  Lainey, how are you doing to us?  Lainey, what are you doing to us?  Lainey, what are you doing to us?  Lainey, what are you doing to us?  Lainey, what are you doing to us?  Lainey?  Lainey.  I don't want to see her in the bra.  Lainey.  I can't beg for it.  I can't do that.  We don't need a bra.  No, no, no, no.  I can't even.  I would have to take off my whole outfit.  Oh, stop the bullshit. 
[03:26:30]  You came in prepared to do a show now that you like us to do the show.  And I'll give you a ticket for governance tonight in Levittown, Long Island.  I'm not taking off my job.  You get to laugh.  Oh, man.  And I get to look.  I'm wasting all this time.  I'm not going to.  Oh, boy.  No.  We don't want Lainey negotiating.  Lainey, you don't have to.  There's no negotiation.  That's okay.  Your track record is still good, Lainey.  She could have got loads in heaps.  Your consecutive game streak is over, but you'd be good for us.  You know what I mean?  You'd be good for us.  Like when you give a ticket load, you give it like in heaps. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, like heaping spoonfuls of it.  You could have had that.  That could have been you, but no, you wanted to play possum.  All right.  Well, I broke my one fucking cigarette.  You got nice calves.  Why don't we let the.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Disappointment leave.  That's from dancing, right?  All right.  Being up on your toes.  Thank you.  That was wonderful.  Thanks for the cake, Lainey.  Thank you.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's par for the course.  Oh, man. 
[03:27:30]  It just is.  I'm okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Strippers, no offense, but this happens every time dancers come in.  It's a fake sexiness.  It's like I came here.  I was all happy.  I was so depressed.  No winners, right?  No winners.  No winners.  No winners.  She's a very pretty girl, but that's why I don't go to strip clubs ever.  That's why I don't plug them.  Why?  Because you stink.  Because she's like a hopeless, like, wet down or something.  Because it's all just fake.  It's a waste of fucking time.  That's why.  It's a fake sexiness.  It's not like coming to Governors and seeing the sexiest comic in history do his act at 
[03:28:00]  8 and 10.  You know what I mean?  10-30.  Screw that.  That's why I don't know.  Oh, what time is it tonight?  Two shows at Governors tonight.  Andrew Dice Clay, 8 and 10-30.  Yeah.  And the big special in, where is it?  In Chicago.  In Chicago.  Say it right, because we're just going on sale now.  It's on sale now.  In St. Charles, Illinois at the Arcata Theater.  Arcata Theater.  Saturday, August 25th.  That's right.  Tickets on sale tomorrow for this.  It's O-A-M-Kind.  My kind of-  Oh.  I'm giving you the big plug.  How am I going to get all that over? 
[03:28:30]  O-Shows.com.  Thank you.  Go to O-Shows.com.  We're trying to sell some tickets for you.  Oh, alright.  I don't know.  Now you can do your thing.  Now you do your thing.  Your thing.  I was in it, but then I came out of it.  No, you were going to sing a thing for everybody.  No, I was doing Sammy Davis.  You're doing Sammy Davis.  Sammy Davis.  Why can't I find my eye?  That's big.  Oh.  Get it?  Oh, wow.  I got it.  Get it?  Oh, goodbye?  No, I'm sitting over here.  You know what I do?  You're going to whisper to Lainey. 
[03:29:00]  Whisper nasty things.  No, not me at all.  She doesn't like the fact that I was looking at her legs.  You know what I do?  I'll call her in about 15 minutes.  Wait, you didn't like that Jimmy was looking at your legs and you moved position.  Maybe 45 minutes to an hour.  At least somebody appreciates it.  Back.  Get it?  Oh, man, come on now.  She moved over there because Jim was looking at her skirt.  Why are you here?  I'm the one guy in here that was nice to you and you're not being nice to-  No, you're being such a sweetheart.  But I'm not-  You didn't like him looking at your legs either.  It's like you don't understand why I'm a rotten person I can be.  No, I know.  I-  Really.  No, I understand. 
[03:29:30]  Look at the chick like you've never seen Gash.  Play hard to get a little.  You'll see it.  She'll change his tone.  This is why-  She'll change it.  And she's a very-  She's an attractive girl.  I'm not going to bash her physically because she is a pretty girl, man.  I cannot lie.  There you go.  No sex.  Whenever they bring dancers to us, we always say no.  We almost always say no to having girls in.  I'm all six.  Dancers.  Because it's always the same thing.  Regular girls are amazing.  They come in here- 
[03:30:00]  Porn girls are usually not good.  You know who's good?  The penthouse girls are usually good.  They're wonderful ladies.  More penthouse girls, please.  They get it when they come in and we promote them.  Of course they do.  They get naked and they're way hotter.  Of course they do.  What are you making a face like?  We don't touch them.  But they understand where they are.  They understand the audience we have and what the purpose of it is.  We don't grab them.  We're not rapists.  No, I know.  Those girls we say yes to when they come in.  Dancers we always say no to.  And almost all porn girls, with the exception of maybe Bella Donna and somebody else- 
[03:30:30]  Brie was cool.  Brie Olsen was phenomenal.  Brie Blue half the place.  Um, yeah.  Are you serious?  Uh, it happens.  You know what?  And that-  That's what we're talking about.  Winners.  And all that was about-  It was like showing hot talents.  Right.  Right.  See, I have to go on at Covenants at 8 o'clock to show mine.  These chicks could go anywhere.  Right.  It's like, yeah, you wanna see what I could do?  I hear ya.  You know, good, good, good, good, good.  Good, good.  Next thing you know, old Jed's a millionaire. 
[03:31:00]  I'm mad for Jim Norton.  I'm not mad.  We let him down.  I'm sad for Jim.  It is your birthday too.  We thought we had something nice.  I think it's the first birthday ever with no tits.  It wouldn't even be fun at this point.  First birthday ever with no tits.  It wouldn't be fun.  Yes.  Anthony Cumia is right.  This is-  The first.  Start calling this the Olivia Newton-John birthday.  I thought it was Ethel.  What was the problem with Jess?  She doesn't even get it.  For a witty person, she doesn't get it.  Who was on the show yesterday?  Gary Oldman.  Gary Oldman.  You can't compete with that. 
[03:31:30]  What do you mean I can't compete with that?  I was a joke.  I come up here, what did you say?  Something about me?  This fucking guy, I give him a smack right in his mouth.  He's in Batman.  Great!  Great!  Great!  I was doing Batman way before him.  I had the costume at seven.  Yeah.  Superman.  I protect all-  That's so fucking stupid, Hollywood, and their choices.  Oldman, instead of Dice, being fucking Batman.  Well, Oldman's not the Batman guy.  No, he's not Batman.  He's the Commissioner guy.  He can't fucking be Batman.  He's the Commissioner boy.  I'm more Batman than fucking him. 
[03:32:00]  You know, that's a good point.  You know what I mean?  You're gonna be doing your Woody Allen film.  You don't have time for Batman.  That's-  Well, you know, Woody's a whole different thing.  I sort of want this now.  What's that?  You want what?  I don't want this now.  I get careless.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Let's take her alone.  We're talking about other things now.  Let us sit in a corner.  Sit in a corner.  This goes on all the time with dancers.  Yeah, we're tired of it.  We're just tired of it.  And again, it's like I would love to say she's not attractive, but she is, honestly.  Hey, did you say LA Rocks is doing this special with me?  You forgot that. 
[03:32:30]  But the minute a pair of tits come into the room, everything goes out the fucking window.  Yeah.  You guys back together?  What's that?  Didn't they take a break?  And they had the bass player.  Yeah, but they're back together.  They're really fucking good.  Yeah, they saw them in Vegas.  Oh, yeah.  That was the first week of rehearsal.  Yeah, they were great.  Great, yeah.  I'm not even kidding.  Your sons know what they're doing, man.  Holy fuck.  You know, they got back into it.  They're preparing for the special.  Right?  What special?  I don't know about the special yet.  What do you think I'm talking about Chicago for? 
[03:33:00]  What special?  You know about the special?  My special.  Showtime.  New Year's Eve.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to do it next month and LA Rocks is going to open it and bring me on.  That's sweet.  You know, so I'm excited about that.  Hey, can we go?  Yeah, you can.  Why can't you go?  Well, what day is it?  The 25th.  Saturday, August 25th.  Saturday.  The 25th of fucking August.  August.  August.  Next month.  Wait, that's the week after we're in Chicago.  Why couldn't we figure this out together? 
[03:33:30]  Because we moved the show from Boston to Chicago.  So why don't we just stay in Chicago so we can see the Dice thing?  Yeah, why don't you?  They're still talking.  Let me.  Shut up.  Shut your mouth when I'm talking about something.  Listen to me.  Shut it up.  No, you shut your mouth.  Don't open your mouth to me when I'm saying something.  Oh, boy.  I'll make you wait outside the room.  Don't make me get mad at you now.  I don't even know you.  Do you shave everything or a little bit?  Stop with the shaving.  You know they rip every hair out of their assholes today. 
[03:34:00]  How do they stand with a tweezer for hours?  Do you like I miss one of my asshole hairs?  Mr. Dice, I got a question.  Do you like a bleached asshole?  Don't.  I don't want to go into my stuff.  You don't.  Daddy, he talks about it.  Yeah, I talk about bleached assholes.  Oh, you do?  I didn't see your show, so I don't know.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What's the matter with you?  Because Anthony knew.  That's fucking great.  What about the sap?  You like sap?  I talk.  Stop saying the things.  Don't say the things.  Don't say the things. 
[03:34:30]  You did tell him, you see?  I told him.  No, he didn't tell me the bleached assholes.  It was so funny.  Wait, wait, wait.  He told me the sap thing.  Wait, let me hear.  Where's the sap actually come from?  The sap?  Yeah, the sap.  Yeah, like all the...  Maple trees?  No, like the women's sap.  What do you mean sap?  Anthony is the bad problem, right?  I don't know what you mean sap.  Like from the pores of the skin, like around your thighs, like when you get excited, is  that the sap?  The sap?  Well, I'm saying it nice.  Like women liquid.  Whatever the fuck.  Jimmy's so sad he left.  Like the pre-cum. 
[03:35:00]  The birthday boy left.  That's how sad he was.  Why do you gotta use vulgarity?  You're not gonna get anything out of her that way.  You're a married man.  You just took vows.  What are you doing in your life?  Your marriage.  You know?  He married a beautiful girl.  Beautiful wedding.  And two days later, he's going, where's my pre-cum?  You come in here, you don't bring me pre-cum.  You come to my house, you don't bring me pre-cum.  What's wrong with you?  Who does that?  Who does that?  It's an ingrate. 
[03:35:30]  They all walk in wet and they leave soaked.  I hear ya.  What?  What happened there?  He can cut it.  Cut what?  What's going on here?  Because I can't get out of it and I'm not getting in my panties, so I told Jim he can  cut my dress off.  No, don't cut a dress.  That's all wrong.  No, that's not a nice thing to do.  No, I said it's cool.  Wait, we might have winners here today?  It's actually sexier.  That's all wrong.  We might have winners though.  That is pretty sexy.  We might have winners.  He can cut me out of my dress.  We'll give her that.  We might have winners.  He's gonna cut the whole dress off? 
[03:36:00]  No, just like...  The top.  Just the top, cut it down.  That's pretty fucking good.  We might have winners.  Let's see.  We might have winners.  Let's see.  Let me make sure that people know about Dice's shows tonight, Governor's.  Yes.  Two shows in Levittown, 8 and 10-30.  And...  Can Florentine get a plug in?  Wait a minute.  What?  Yeah.  Are you with me tonight?  I'm doing Club Casbah down in Wildwood, New Jersey tonight through Sunday.  Why didn't you come with me instead?  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  You didn't know.  You got the little boy, right?  Yeah, I got Jameson with me, but he always likes when you're there. 
[03:36:30]  We have a lot of fun.  So where are you gonna be tonight?  Down in Wildwood, New Jersey, Club Casbah.  Yeah, but that's like another state.  Yeah, I know.  It's way down.  Yeah, I gotta talk about what's over here.  Well, he's talking about what's over there.  You got here, he's got there.  You guys are in Chicago, right?  No.  We're here right now.  Well, we're in Chicago on satellite.  Well, I'm over here.  We're all over the country.  We're gonna be in Chicago August 10th, but that confuses everybody.  Oh, that's right.  You're doing a lot.  That confuses everybody.  Let's not talk about our thing.  We're talking about your thing on the 25th.  My thing is in Chicago on the 25th. 
[03:37:00]  Tickets go on sale, what, tomorrow?  Yeah, but it's the taping of the final stand-up special for Andrew Dice Club.  Then you retire, then you come back out of retirement.  No, you wanna know something?  It's not about retiring.  I'm planning a major tour.  There's a lot going on with me.  I know you guys know.  I didn't really come up here to plug and say, yeah, I got this.  No.  No.  No, serious.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  I know I'm starring in the Woody Allen movie.  I know it's fucking unbelievable.  We didn't even get to talk about that.  We didn't even get to talk about that.  Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, I know how great I'll be in that movie. 
[03:37:30]  Right.  Sure.  But I'm not here to talk about it.  I know that I got a New Year's Eve Showtime special that's absolutely gonna thrill America  with the undisputed king of all-time fucking comedy.  Right.  I get that.  But I'm not a bragger.  That's not what I'm here to do.  It's not what you came here for.  It's not what we know.  But you know, Chicago's always been great to me.  Sure.  I did Crime Story there, which you guys remember, the Michael Mann series.  And when I had to move my show, they said, where do you want to go? 
[03:38:00]  I said, Chicago.  Chicago.  And it's gonna be the most exciting stand-up, I would have to say the most exciting stand-up  special ever.  Ever.  All right.  I'm not saying that I'm, you know, I mean, I'm here with two very great, great comedians.  You're gonna do this all day?  No.  Turn it down.  Turn down the lights.  We might have winners dice.  You know what?  Wait a minute.  What?  Oh boy.  All right.  So I talked about that and governors tonight, so all right.  But we might have winners.  Do something.  We might have winners.  All right. 
[03:38:30]  Sam, what's going on?  Are we gonna have winners today?  What's going on?  No, I said that you could cut.  You're gonna cut her shirt.  Okay, if she's...  Cut her shirt open.  Not all the way off.  And then, um...  Not like sexy.  Do it sexy.  Right between the breasts.  Because I have to take it all off.  Right.  Right.  So that'll leave enough room for your shoulders and stuff to get like there, right?  Let me give you some room.  Well, Lainey must have...  Go ahead, Norton.  Do your thing.  That's some terrific stuff.  So where am I cutting from?  But do it sexy.  You know what to do.  Come on.  Do Norton.  What about the bun? 
[03:39:00]  We're good with the bun?  Yeah, the bun's fine.  Jimmy's got scissors.  I don't know.  You tell me.  Where should he cut?  Just show him around the area to cut.  Cut right up through our cleavage.  I got stabbed three times.  I'll start here.  Alright.  Now, Jimmy's cutting.  Why are you nervous?  No, because I know it's scissors towards my face.  See, he's not running.  I'm not running with them.  I'm running with them.  Down syndrome.  I'm standing here.  I know, but if anybody bumps you...  No one's gonna bump me.  No one's bumping.  Look where my hand is. 
[03:39:30]  It's blocking the scissors.  That's never happened.  Jim, make sure you don't cut the bun.  All right.  She's...  Jim was voted the scissor cutting key in.  Why are you so gentle?  A second ago...  She's a psychopath.  A second ago...  This is how crazy she is.  A second ago, she's fucking turning her head away and going, don't cut me.  And then she goes, why are you so gentle?  What a cook.  Just be the gentleman.  It's very, very nice.  Oh shit, we're back on that thing again.  All right.  There it is.  Now a little further. 
[03:40:00]  Now you rip it open a little.  What do you think?  Well, he's gotta get through the material.  Do Norton.  Okay.  Wait, oh my gosh.  Not too crazy.  No, he's gotta make a...  He's gotta make a...  A thing.  I'm not gonna cut your breasts.  Oh man.  Here we go.  Oh my gosh, there's like more people in there.  All right.  It's okay.  You're on a basketball team where there's 20,000 people watching every night.  Well, speaking of basketballs...  You know what?  It does look better that way.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that looks pretty good.  Yeah, we got winners now.  How much time?  Now, did I not do a phenomenal, gentle... 
[03:40:30]  You did a great job.  That's pretty good.  ...cutting job?  I also do that when I...  Let him do the ripping if you're gonna do more.  What are we ripping here?  I don't know how much...  Can I tell you something?  Oh, we can do more.  That's nice.  Thank you.  She's got a nice boob job.  She started out with big boobs, but she didn't like...  No, they look natural.  No, it's like...  They do, right?  Dice.  Like in the microwave.  Oh, man.  They're getting bigger.  Oh.  I have to say...  Are they nice?  Jimmy's squeezing them.  They are...  Phenomenal.  Extraordinarily...  No, they feel really real. 
[03:41:00]  They're bouncing.  Thank you so much for this because, you know, Jimmy was disappointed.  Wow.  This is nice.  This is a nice gift.  This is a nice gift.  Sometimes at the end of heartbreak, there's always something beautiful.  A light at the end of the tunnel, a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  That's my fetish.  I love large nipples.  Oh, man.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'll show you.  Okay.  That's fair.  It's okay.  What happened?  It's an honor to show me.  Don't trip and fall.  That's okay.  Jimmy's looking at him now.  No one else can.  Wow. 
[03:41:30]  She has really, really large, thick nipples.  Oh, good.  They're very nice.  Thank you.  He's got a badge too and he could talk about it to us.  Wonderful.  Great for the winners.  She's probably embarrassed about her vagina because a lot of women, Native American  women typically have larger vaginas.  Do they?  Yes, they do.  They have bigger pussy lips.  It's like a papoose.  No, but I'm saying that in a complimentary way.  You know what it is?  It's not that large.  They typically have thicker.  They have that peppercorn in there.  Peppercorn.  Am I right at all?  It's like a cornucopia. 
[03:42:00]  Is that what you're saying?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Hold on.  We're establishing something here.  Yes, Jimmy.  Native American women typically do have larger vaginas.  And I mean bigger or thicker.  Am I correct?  I've read that.  You're right.  Like the National Geographic.  Like big lips.  Big lips.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, you're right.  Now what were you saying no for?  They're big, like they're thick but not long?  Now what was I wrong about it?  You almost said I was wrong about something.  No, you're right.  I had to think, but you're right.  Large clitoris?  Yeah.  What is this like? 
[03:42:30]  It's a good question.  That's what it is.  You're right.  This is an excellent interview.  Yeah, Jimmy's doing a great job.  This is the point.  I happen to think that's very sexy.  There's nothing sexy there.  Some guys like it.  What's that?  Some guys like it.  Some guys don't appreciate it.  Big fucking monkey lips between them legs when they get like that.  How great is that?  Sometimes maybe you could just see her.  With the fucking sap coming from the pores.  We're going for winners now.  Maybe you could just see her G-string.  We're going for winners now.  The front of her G-string.  We ain't seeing anything.  We ain't seeing anything.  I see like the outline.  You know what?  I think him cutting her shirt.  That's a winner right there. 
[03:43:00]  Got her there.  Got her there.  Now, are you...  You know what I mean?  It made her feel a little sexy.  Are you visible through your panties or no?  No.  There's flowers on them.  No, but can you see the outline normally?  No.  Oh, who's your bullshitting Sarah?  Come on.  Sarah.  Are you scalped down there?  I don't think she knows what you're talking about.  What are the panties made out of burlap?  I don't think she knows what you're talking about.  No.  He wants to know if you're in your underwear, can you see whippage or something?  Are you scalped down there or does it look like a beaver pelt?  I have a fucking 80s bush, okay?  Nice. 
[03:43:30]  Nice.  You're 18.  I claim it.  Europeans coming back.  I hope it comes back.  I hope it comes back.  Europeans back.  Let me tell you something.  Do you have hair down there?  Do you have hair down there?  Do you have hair down there?  Why not?  Why not?  A little bit.  See, he's happy now.  A little bit.  I'm partially happy.  Why are you saying she's bald down there, Dice?  He's partially happy.  I would love to see that.  Do you feel partially happy?  Nah.  Could he go under your dress?  It's like an undeveloped box.  Adrian.  Adrian.  Andrew doesn't like it when it's completely shaved. 
[03:44:00]  I don't like when it's complete because it's like underdeveloped.  No, I know what you mean.  It's sexy.  It's underdeveloped.  Yeah.  It's like throwing some fucking hair.  When there's like a landing strip.  A landing strip.  The landing strip, you know, that's old news.  You gotta go more with like a little island.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What kind of island?  What shape?  No, no.  What shape of the island?  You could keep the box lips nice and clean, waxed out, bleach, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Put it on.  Who gives a shit?  But above, you need the box hair just so a guy's got somewhere to cushion his cock in 
[03:44:30]  between.  But why would you want, why would a guy want his face and like hair?  You know, the excitement of sticking your face in somebody's box.  Like a girl doesn't want her face in hair.  You know what I mean?  And then you...  How big are they?  Well, let me ask you.  Like a...  Like a...  Do you like a guy like completely shaved down?  Like you gotta do like strumming before you even go anywhere.  No, serious.  Do you like a guy shaved down or just natural?  Not shaved down, but not like, oh my gosh, like this is disgusting.  I'm totally about it.  Yeah, but how many guys are really that disgusting?  Oh, guys that shave like...  Guys, guys...  That's so weird. 
[03:45:00]  I shave.  I don't wanna talk...  Men are supposed to have hair.  Like chest hair.  Exactly.  Not back hair.  Exactly.  You have some wispy, Jimmy.  I have no hair at all.  You got wispy hair on your arm.  A tall, nude child.  A tall, nude child.  So are your lips really long and thick, or are they just...  Oh, please.  You can just tell me.  I love that.  I love that.  It makes me very happy.  It's my birthday.  Okay.  Can Jimmy see your lips?  It looks like buffalo meat drying in the sun.  That would be hot.  I'm just using an Indian analogy.  Yeah.  To make everyone comfortable. 
[03:45:30]  I like when the lips get a little wallity.  I like that.  Wallity.  Wallity.  You know what I mean?  Wallity.  Wallity.  You could show them.  When they get that little alligator feel to them like they've really been through something.  Wallity.  An alligator wallet.  Lumped out in the sun a little bit.  Yeah.  They could really take a fucking beating.  You know what I mean?  Take a beat.  Or have they just been thrown in the pool?  Would you show me and I would just report to the guys?  It's like you almost want your balls to feel like both of us gotta get through that little hole. 
[03:46:00]  Condoleezza rice or something?  Yeah.  That they fight to just shoot out right into a fucking box.  Sure.  Like I'll sit over there.  We need Patron.  And you could show me.  Could you show Jimmy the lips?  Only Jimmy.  I'm very respectful.  I wouldn't.  Yeah.  Jimmy would be the winner.  Sit down?  No, I'll sit down.  So you can stand in front of me so you don't have to feel like everybody's looking.  Yeah, just do the pull away.  Just quickly for Jimmy.  The panty pull over?  Yeah.  The panty pull over for Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy, you gotta go over there.  I'll be nice.  I think you know I'll be nice.  I'm gonna go over there already.  What are you waiting for?  And then we all go home happy. 
[03:46:30]  Take a seat, Jimmy.  And it turns out to be a big misunderstanding.  I gotta have a fucking cigarette.  I'm sweating in this room.  Oh, man.  You don't have to sit.  You don't have to sit.  All right, Jimmy for his birthday.  Jimmy's sitting down.  Get a microphone on Jimmy.  He's got one.  You're gonna do a little thong pull away.  And a thong pull away for just Jimmy.  So I could see.  Just for Jimmy.  I'm pulling my panties over?  Yeah, so I can look, but I won't touch.  I'm not pulling my panties over.  Why not?  Why am I sitting here then?  Maybe if you waited a half a second.  Well, you could do that.  I would like to see.  Give yourself a wedgie.  A pussy wedgie.  Jim, she might have a thing. 
[03:47:00]  A wedgie.  Oh, you got your thing?  I got my thing.  The best part is watching Lainey mime to her.  Just pull him up.  Just pull him up.  Oh, I know.  Hey, Lainey, let me ask you.  Lainey's a pimp.  Lainey, we're good with you, by the way.  Now, Lainey, what is going on in your head right now?  Like, you see this as being...  I'm not thinking.  Give her a mic.  Is there a mic there?  Or no, you might have the mic.  Mike?  Steve, I'm not like, you know, it's nothing.  No, but I want to see it.  I'm not going to show Mike.  Why not?  Because that's too much.  What's too much?  They're silly. 
[03:47:30]  Why?  She might have picked the wrong profession.  She might have picked the wrong profession.  The legitimate interview.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of kind of behavior going on in here.  I was promised a legitimate interview.  You want us to Charlie Rose, you're asked.  This is an unsavory moment.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, Lainey, do you see this as being an appearance that kind of went...  Like, you saw this was about to become a tremendous disaster.  Yes.  Yeah, it was heading down that road.  I've been down that road.  Yeah, you have, Lainey.  But we treat girls who are really cool, we treat...  I told her that you guys are cool.  We've had a couple run out crying, but you know, that was a misunderstanding. 
[03:48:00]  Out of all the girls, to have just two or three run out crying.  Honestly...  That's not bad.  It's not bad.  Did you get me wrong?  No, you're good.  I'm gonna be honest with you.  The fact that Kenny would not let me come in with her...  Oh, boy.  I think, like, she came in alone...  Oh, boy.  She's blaming Kenny for this whole thing.  I tried to go in with her.  No, but you're...  Kenny's been blamed for the whole thing.  Kenny's been told...  Kenny doesn't let me.  Kenny doesn't know that...  You're actually one of the ones who can come in.  Kenny doesn't know that.  We told him no publicist.  You're different.  But he's seen me come in with the girls, but it just makes me...  Nah, but he's a big joke. 
[03:48:30]  But he's a big joke.  Kenny's...  He doesn't remember.  I have to do a do-si-do with him every time I come in.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, wow!  I don't know.  She just has a problem with me.  Oh, are you okay?  Wait, first of all, is Laney okay?  Are you okay, Laney?  I didn't know she was standing there.  Laney, sit down.  Sit down.  What happened to Laney?  Are you okay?  She always has a problem with me and has to mention my name every chance she gets.  Sit down, Laney.  She just got smashed with the door.  It went right into the door.  The door went right into her back.  Sit down.  He didn't mean to do it.  Oh, my God.  This is fucking crazy. 
[03:49:00]  Are you okay?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  Well, that took a turn for the worse.  It got dark.  Kenny's very...  Yeah, but he can't see you coming through the door.  I know.  It was an accident.  Kenny came in like fucking Kramer.  He's a big guy.  That was scary.  Oh, my God, Laney.  All of that weight against the door.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm okay.  I'm all right.  You got a comment?  I don't know.  It's just fucking... 
[03:49:30]  What a show, huh?  It's like one of Anthony's old relationships.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  It's thought of great, then it's fucking ugly, and then it's all right, and now it's  just...  Now it's just fucking weird.  That was just the glass being thrown at me in that jacuzzi.  Yeah.  So does Laney have a problem with Dice?  With Kenny?  Sorry, Dice.  No.  It's just...  I wanted to...  I usually come in with the girls, which...  I mean, I've been coming in with the girls for a while, and he stopped me and told me  I couldn't come in, and it's just...  It usually helps a lot if someone's new to the show to see them just sitting there 
[03:50:00]  with a turner, and it always works, and...  Watch that door.  It might swing open on you.  You know, once before he, like, didn't...  You know, for some reason when he's there he doesn't want me to come in.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Is your back okay?  I'm okay.  Man, you took a fucking hit.  I'm okay.  We're gonna have to build back up to the pussy list.  I don't know how we do that at this point.  What the fuck is going on?  I can't believe it's turned to violence.  That's what I mean.  If you would have done the legitimate interview, none of this would have happened. 
[03:50:30]  The big Charlie Rose thing.  You know?  We need Charlie Rose.  Now I gotta feel bad.  People are getting hurt, and their clothes ripped off.  Scissors and doors being thrown.  You know?  Yeah, there was a lot of weird stuff there.  Yeah.  Clothes were cut off with scissors, and...  Man.  Yeah.  Lainey's a trooper because she kind of made that happen.  Yeah.  Like, I know you didn't really want to do that.  No, I wanted to do it.  Yeah, we want to thank...  I told her I don't feel comfortable taking it off, but I'll...  Why are you not comfortable taking it off?  Honestly, are you insecure? 
[03:51:00]  Is that why there's a little insecurity?  No, I just felt like...  You got a bad scar?  No, I don't have scars.  No.  Well, we're trying to find out why.  That's all.  I just feel like, you know, some things are, like, sexy or not, like...  Yeah, in a radio station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, that's what I'm saying.  You go home with the guy, it's his birthday.  You said that before.  You were right.  Yeah, that's what you're doing.  What are you going to do here?  I swear...  He's going to see the boobs, the box, the whole fucking nine yards.  You know, but yet he can't lay the pipe because we're standing in a place that's surrounded. 
[03:51:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony with TVs on, lights, cameras, surgery.  You know what I mean?  I gotta say something.  Yeah.  Probably one of the best Dice appearances ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Today.  Dice, you're fucking hilarious.  Well, I'm trying to help a lot of people.  I know you're trying to help, but that's what you do.  But that's what you do.  You helped a lot of people.  You helped people.  I think there's a lot of winners.  Holy shit.  I feel bad for Lanny.  What about Ethel?  Hold on.  Now Kenny's going to feel bad that he hit her with the fucking door. 
[03:52:00]  No, he's not.  Dice, listen.  Listen.  Careful.  Hold on.  How bright is she?  She's standing in front of a fucking door.  Has she ever gone to one before?  You know what I mean?  Oh, let me stand in front of a solid metal door.  What?  So the biggest guy in the building can smack it into my back.  You know what?  You should have moved out of the fucking way a hair foul would go.  You're right, Dice.  I don't stand in front of doors without windows.  I said something, play the tape back.  Never.  You're right, Dice.  Listen to me.  You're right, Dice. 
[03:52:30]  Go ahead.  I swear to you, we've got to go because we're running a total crowd at Fez time,  even though the clock says differently, but we've got a lot of shit we have to get in  by 11.  Yeah, do what you've got to do.  So why don't you tell everyone who the winners are today and the losers?  How you see it.  The show?  Is Jim Horton a winner for being his birthday and how that works out?  She's a winner and, you know, with a little pressure and, you know, my finesse, we got  her tits out of her shirt.  So she's a winner.  Your finesse?  Yeah.  Remember when you were yelling at her, you said you've got to chill out, you've got to 
[03:53:00]  charm the chick.  I like how your box lips look through your pants, things like that.  We got better.  We're all cool now, right?  That's right.  Yeah, we're fine now.  Because when that argument was going on, there was no chance of never seeing anything.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all right.  Hey, is she a winner now that she showed her tits?  No, no, no.  She's a winner.  She's a champ.  Thank you.  She had a great time.  You know, once she was relaxed.  Happy birthday, Jimmy boy.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Is Lainey a winner for taking a door in the back?  Lainey took a door in the back. 
[03:53:30]  She's a winner.  Winner.  You know what?  She's sitting there.  She's laughing.  Obviously, she's not hurt.  She's good.  Obviously, there's no lawsuit because she's sitting there laughing, having a great time  again.  Oh, boy.  Fucking nickel.  You know how much we're going to owe her a lot now.  Jim Florentine.  She now has the upper hand.  Fuck!  Jimmy Florentine.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy Two Bulls.  Married.  Jimmy's been great.  Beautiful wife.  Beautiful kid.  Another winner of the week, I'd have to say, right?  Yeah.  Anthony. 
[03:54:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Winners.  Definite winners.  Winners in general.  They're doing so good, I feel like the studio feels bigger this time.  It does, right?  It's a nice size studio.  I don't know if it's the way you lit it.  It's a little small.  Sucks.  A little small.  This is a great room.  This is a great hang.  Don't remind us.  It's okay.  You want something bigger?  That was all good until you said that.  You know what?  Let me talk to who I got to talk to.  We want a bigger room.  Don't you have a couple?  No.  Oh.  We got to go.  All the plugs get in.  Dice.
