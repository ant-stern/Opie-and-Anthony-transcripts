<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, starting with their "Whippin' Out Wednesday" promotion, hampered by cold weather. Opie detailed a chilly morning, followed by an inline skating adventure with Psycho Mark, Stinky, and Mike DiNicola, anticipating a potential police “mob scene.”  He then complained about his own intense body odor, described by him as "cranky ass" and later "swamp nuts" by a caller, intensified by an oscillating fan.  The segment included updates on Spaz, a show staffer, his health, and some Spazburg-related vandalism of "WOW" signs.

A substantial portion focused on the internal conflict with Earl, a show staffer, culminating in an ultimatum: leave or stay.  After a break, Earl was in the studio. Opie recounted a lunchtime encounter with a woman attempting a "Whippin' Out Wednesday" submission.  The hosts then brainstormed absurd ways to write Earl off the show, suggesting scenarios ranging from a helicopter crash to a Sims-style starvation,  a murder mystery ("Who shot Earl?"), and a Scooby-Doo-style reveal.  They briefly mentioned seeing Bill Boggs and Stormfield. The success of the "WOW" campaign and Jay Moore's appearance on Bill Maher's "Politically Incorrect" (which they disliked) were also discussed.  The segment ended with further discussion of Earl’s departure, sponsor mentions (Ranch 1 and Vermont Teddy Bear Company), and a reference to the Nine and Snails show.

The next segment heavily featured the Giuliani-Hanover separation, with much crude and sexually suggestive speculation about Giuliani's alleged affair with Judith Nathan. Callers, including several identifying as NYPD officers, shared gossip and opinions using offensive language. Giuliani's physical appearance was also mocked. A listener recounted a prank call the hosts made to a funeral home about Giuliani’s supposedly deceased father.  Promotion for "WOW" stickers with Earl and Psycho Mark was included.  The segment also discussed The Who's reunion tour and high ticket prices, with many jokes about the band members' age.  It concluded with a caller’s anecdote about their grandmother's deathbed comments and a limousine service advertisement.


The show continued with more discussion on aging rock bands, specifically The Who and Phil Collins' Disney work, before transitioning to a hidden microphone recording of four strippers outside the studio. This recording contained highly explicit sexual content detailing their experiences and preferences.  The hosts struggled to maintain a clean broadcast, frequently cutting the audio and using euphemisms.  They attempted an X-rated trivia game, but this was repeatedly interrupted by the strippers' conversation.  Callers commented on aging bands and concert experiences.  Guests Mike Torrey and Joe Son were in the studio.  Finally, the strippers entered the studio for a planned hot wax segment (details not fully provided).

The final segment involved the strippers in the studio, escalating the already sexually explicit and vulgar conversations.  A significant part detailed the hot-waxing process, with extensive commentary from the hosts, callers, and strippers themselves. Joe Torre’s son was mentioned as having left earlier. The segment ended with the strippers giving their contact information and more vulgar banter followed by an advertisement for Fidelity Diamonds.

[00:15:30]  It's time for his decision  Yeah, we gave him a choice yesterday  He was having such trouble with the program yesterday  Feeling that he was the brunt of a lot of our abuse yesterday  And we gave him a choice  Because he was getting all cranky  He wouldn't come on the phone  He'd hang up on us in the middle of our conversation with him  And we gave him a choice yesterday  Told him to think about it overnight  Do you want to be part of this program?  Do you want to leave this program?  Right  It's a final decision  If he chooses to be on this program 
[00:16:00]  He will be on this program  I guess  Well, and I discussed some options today at lunch  By the way, to the lady that wanted to wow us  And we went into the restaurant real fast  Honk your horn  Yeah, we got an email  A girl right there  I'm 56  56  Said that I wanted to wow you guys  I saw you  But you ducked into a restaurant real fast  Honk your horn  We'll take our time going into a restaurant  Got the sushi  So Bill Boggs walking into the sushi place today  Yeah  Bill Boggs

Midday Live was on like  Then what it was  In the late 70s, I think  And then we saw Stormfield outside  Yeah, Stormfield was just outside  I wanted to call him Ernie and Astus  And piss him off  I thought he was a lot taller  Yeah, he's a 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, I hope he's ready to say  Hey, Ernie and Astus  It's like you can't tell  It's so funny walking around Manhattan  Because you see these people all the time  You see people you see on TV  But you're not quite sure  Of who they are right away  Yeah  And you don't want to say anything  Because it's like  Hey, Ernie and Astus  Right  Oh, Stormfield, you jerk off  Stormfield  Stormfield  Yeah  All right  Well  Earl's in the studio  Hey, Earl  How you doing?  Did the meeting make you feel better? 
[00:17:30]  I hope you weren't upset  That I was playing Soldier of Fortune  During the entire  I wouldn't expect anything  The entire meeting  Did you see that shot I took  Of the guy's foot?  It was great  Earl, I showed some sensitivity  In the back office today, right?  Yeah  Surprisingly  You're very cool  Yeah, I'm very cool  Off air  Now did that  Yeah, off air  We switch roles off air  It's the bastard  Like  I just have  Doesn't care about anything  Very busy  And I'm the one that  Keeps everybody  Happy, I guess 
[00:18:00]  And I just had  Very busy  I had things to do  I'm on the final level, Sophie  So, Earl  You've taken some hits  Lately on the show  A lot of abuse  About the invisible man  A lot of abuse  About your new nickname  But  Thanks  No, that's not his  That's not his new nickname  So, everyone is wondering  Do you want to  Still be a part of the O&A show?  Yes, I do  Oh  There's a surprising 
[00:18:30]  There's a surprising answer  Is there any buts?  Buts  Because you can't  You can't be part of the O&A show  But  Oh  Oh  Help me  Help me  Help me  Somebody help me  Help me  Help me  Stop that  So, are you okay with this program?  Yeah  You're okay with 
[00:19:00]  With your appearances  On this program  The way you're treated  On this program  There are certain points  When I'm like  Don't put this on the air  And that's not your fault  It's more of Spaz's fault  Why?  How is Spaz getting home?  Yeah, I know  Like when I call  When I'll call in  I'll say  God  With something absolutely  That has nothing to do  With the show  I'll say  Don't  This is not for air  We were well aware  Of the stuff you didn't want  On the air  That makes it better  To bring up on the air  Earl  The stuff you didn't want 
[00:19:30]  On the air  Was the friend  Allegedly  That was in the studio  That was it  But you mentioned it  During your shift  That somebody was in the studio  So that's why we said  Who was that?  I'm the invisible man  And we went on to say  That there wasn't anybody  In the studio  And then it gave us  Two hours of hilarious radio  Yes  Hilarity  We know who 
[00:20:00]  Who was in the studio  We know  I'm the invisible man  And I think it's time  To expose it  Earl  It was the great kazoo  Wasn't it?  From the Flintstones  Remember that  From the Flintstones?  Only Fred and Barney  Could see them?  Well  Dumb Dumb  Yes  Earl  Earl  So you still want to be  Part of the show  Sure  Definitely  Ant and I are not  Really sure that  Yeah we did a lot 
[00:20:30]  Of thinking  You're  You're  Capable of handling  The abuse that we  Throw at you  Yeah some people  Can choose to want  To do something  But then  Other people can see  That maybe they're not  Into it  You know how the cops  Have to take a stress test  And stuff like that  A psychological evaluation  The guy might want to be  A cop really bad  But the people  In charge  Might see that  Maybe he can't handle it  And it's in his best interest  That he not be a cop  Well maybe it's in your  Best interest that 
[00:21:00]  Even though you want to be  Part of the program  That you're not  Part of the program anymore  Well there's just  You seem a little  Unstable  A little wrapped  A little too tight  That could be true  Yeah  Yeah  So we're thinking  Of a scenario here  Yeah some way  Where  Maybe everyone  Will be happy here  We're thinking of  Killing you off  You ever see  How they do that  On TV  No in the sitcom sense  You ever see  How they do that  All the time 
[00:21:30]  They kill off a character  You've been a part  Of the O&A show  For almost two years  Right from the beginning  One of the  Initial characters  And we're thinking of  You are part  Like if this was  If it was like  Happy Days  You would be like  The Richie  Potsie  Ralph Mouth  No he obviously  Would be Styx  Styx  The only black guy  In Happy Days  Hey 
[00:22:00]  Reference of the day yet  Very good  I gotta give you  A reference of the day  Alright  But as far as  The people that were  On the show  Right from the start  You know how that was  Richie  Potsie  Ralph  Fonz  You know all there  Gotta be Chuck  Chuck  Well Chuck was there  From the beginning  But you saw what  Happened with Chuck  There's a  There's a good example  He just came up  With one  Yeah  Chuck  Chuck  Chuck just disappeared  Off of Happy Days  The brother  I guess what Ann's 
[00:22:30]  Trying to say is  We're gonna write you  Off the show  So we just need  A scenario  Like do you just  Disappear like Chuck did  Maybe he just disappears  And no one ever  Talks about him again  Right  You just walk off  With the basketball  And never to return  Pull like a  Maybe like a  Chrissy Snow  Off of  Three's company  Where all of a sudden  You leave  And sometimes  They get a phone call  From Chrissy  You ever see that  But you never hear  Chrissy's voice  You never see her face  But the other one's  On the phone  And she's talking  And she hangs up  And goes 
[00:23:00]  Jack that was Chrissy  She says hi  You know but there's  Never any voice  Of Chrissy or anything  Or Mrs. Cunningham  That was Chuck  Yeah Mrs. Cunningham  Oh Chuck just called  You never see Chuck  You never hear his voice  They just refer to him  On the phone  Maybe occasionally  We can get up  And go  Hey look  Earl was on the phone  We just talked to him  So we want to write  Your ending  To the Opie and Anthony show  Thank you  Thank you 
[00:23:30]  Maybe we can start  Telling our listeners  That black Earl  Got another job  At a radio station  In Seattle  In Seattle  And then when they see you  On the streets of New York  They can go  Hey Earl  You're back for the weekend  How's Seattle?  Yeah  Like Frasier  Right  You know Frasier  After Cheers  He went to Seattle  And did his little  Psychology show  On the radio  Now Earl  If I was the one  Going to be killed off  From the O&A show  I would want to go out 
[00:24:00]  In a blaze of glory  Yeah  Wouldn't that be great?  I think we all  Could remember one  That was just a dramatic  Ending to a character  Earl  Yeah  Let me give you  An example here  Remember  Remember Earl  Henry Blake  Don't you have a chopper?  Isn't that a chopper though?  Yeah but I believe  It was an airplane  That went down  Alright 
[00:24:30]  Yeah  Who can forget  Who can forget  Radar O'Reilly  Walking in  Walking into the operating room  And announcing to everybody  That Henry Blake's  Plane crashed  Spun in  There were no survivors  Remember?  Henry in his little  Zoot suit  Saying goodbye  Oh so sad  Maybe we could have that  Spaz can come in  Or something  In the middle of the show 
[00:25:00]  Just to interrupt the show  Yeah hold on  Let me get the music  So we could say goodbye  To you  And it seems like  It's a happy ending  You walk down the hall  With your bags packed  You're going home  Yeah  Alright  And then we forget about you  And then like an hour or two later  We'll be in the middle of a funny bid or something  Right  And then all of a sudden  We'll be talking  All of a sudden  Spaz walks into the studio  Yeah we'll be like  Right Opie?  Yeah  That's funny  Another party  That's funny  Guys  Guys  Guys  Um  At 
[00:25:30]  Five o'clock this afternoon  Earl Douglas' chopper  Took off from  The west side  Heliport  And crashed  Into the Hudson River  There were no survivors  And then we can continue to do our show 
[00:26:00]  With our eyes all welled up with tears  Right Earl  How about that ending?  That was a good one for Henry Blake  But your memory can live on through the Invisible Man  Because we're keeping him  I think he's the new character  Because you've got to always have new characters coming into your sitcom  Right  If you write one off  A new one has to come in  Sure  It serves a lot of purposes  It allows the person that's being written off  To pursue other things  It makes a star out of the new guy 
[00:26:30]  And it is a guaranteed ratings grabber  When they write off people on a show  ER  Remember that?  What was her name?  Um  Which one?  The one  I think it was Noah Wiley's character  And the girl  When the homicidal maniac cut him up  And she died  Yeah  I don't watch ER  I watched that one  Yes  They wrote off and maybe we'll have that  Maybe we'll have a homicidal maniac  Who gets through the tough rigorous security here at WNW  Come in and just hack Earl to pieces 
[00:27:00]  So there's a lot of scenarios here  You can leave the show  But we always leave the door open like you can return  And every once in a while we just check in with you  With a one-sided conversation with a phone  On the phone  Where we don't see you or hear you  But we refer to you on the phone  All of a sudden out of commercials  They go  Hey, Ed  You know who that was?  It was Earl  That was Earl  Checking in from Seattle  He just called  He's doing great with his new radio job out there  Remember?  Hey, that was the great gazoo  Where is he?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait 
[00:27:30]  Hello, dum-dums  Well, Earl Douglas  I'll get Fred and Barney  We'll go bowling  I don't like being referred to as the invisible man  All right  Gazoo  Hey, gazoo  Or we could write you off 
[00:28:00]  No, no  Hey, gazoo  Or we could just get someone that could handle the black Earl abuse  And we just change black girls in the middle of the season  And just make believe it's the same guy  Obviously, the best-known one of that  Darren Stevens  Sure  When they exchanged Dick York for a Dick Sergeant  They switched dicks right in the middle of the season  No one knew  So I think that's an option  Or a lot of people are saying the Seinfeld thing  Remember that?  Yeah, where you're just a resident  George's  Or George's wife-to-be 
[00:28:30]  When she was licking the envelopes  Earl could be licking the envelopes for the WOW stickers  And get poisoned  And kill them off that way  In sort of a comedic Seinfeld fashion  Hey, what happened to black Earl?  Right  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  Listen, I just want to say  Send Earl out on a WOW sticker mission  He'll never come back anyway  I mean, he barely even gets to the places  So, you know, it could be one of those things where he just disappears 
[00:29:00]  And if people see him, you know, they'll be like  Hey, Earl, you got any WOW stickers in your hill and spike?  And now I don't work there anymore  Yeah, all right, Pete, very good  All right, man  Thank you  Now everyone's coming up with suggestions  Anthony  Let's see what Charlie thinks  Earl's end should be  What's up, Charlie?  How's it going?  Good  Brian's song  Let him get cancer  And you guys keep going on for like a week or two  You know, as his condition gets, you know, as it worsens  Should we give him a...  That's another thing, too  A disease  A disease  So we give him a disease and we milk it for like a week 
[00:29:30]  And you play the song every time  Yeah, we slowly fade you out, Earl  And then, you know, you have a dramatic ending  Where you have to say goodbye to everyone  That's a good one  And like one of you guys can give a speech every, you know, to the listening audience  Every, like, every couple of days  And in the background you play that song that every time, you know, Brian Piccolo was in, you know, dying  And we all could cry  What was that song?  God, does anyone remember that?  Was it called Brian's song?  It was Brian's song, yeah  Yeah  Oh, if we could only get Brian's song 
[00:30:00]  Try to get that  Yeah, that's a good scenario  That is a good one  Thank you, Charlie  All right, thanks, guys  All right  Take care  Bye  Oh, this is a good one  Paul from Lawrence checking in  The famous dream sequence  We wake up  Or someone wakes up  And Earl was never there  Or Earl wakes from a dream  And there's no radio show  I like the Bob Newhart  The second show  Right  Where he wakes up  And his old haggard wife is in bed with him 
[00:30:30]  Or Dallas  Remember that one?  Oh  Oh, well  I had the weirdest dream  I was a character on the Opie and Anthony show  But everyone knows N.E.W. is the Rock of New York  And I have to go help Scotzo today  What a strange, strange turn of events that dream was  Hmm  I wonder what Opie and Anthony  That's the weirdest thing  Everyone knows this is the Rock of New York 
[00:31:00]  Virgin  Yeah  I had a dream  You were there  And you  And you  Yeah, we could put you in pigtails  And have you on a bed  And we'll have Spaz  And Aunt Nye  And Rick  And Psycho Mark  And Ben  All around the bed  Telling you it was a bad dream  The cowardly lion  And then we could have like  I could be the scarecrow or something  Or Opie could be the tin man  Mm-hmm  Right?  Right  TJ, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  I think you should do like  Who shot Mr. Burns? 
[00:31:30]  Who shot Black girl?  Or you could be, yeah, mysteriously shot  And then with, because then that'll help us with our storyline of our show  Then everyone has to figure out who shot Earl  And then with Mr. Burns, I was like, the obvious choice was Homer  With this, the obvious choice would probably be Psycho Mark  Right  Always running around doing the AK  Yeah, you could just tease that alone for a couple weeks  That's brilliant, man  That's funny  Thank you, TJ  No problem  That was a good one, guys  God, that'd be great  Who shot Earl Douglas? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, that's a good one  What?  Oh, Scooby-Doo ending  Where we rip off Earl's mask  And it's our old boss  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'd have gotten away with it if it wasn't for your meddling kids  Where's my ice cream cone?  The Scooby-Doo ending  We should do the Scooby-Doo ending  The Scooby-Doo ending  God, that would be great 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, if you're just tuning in  We're trying to figure out how to have Earl leave the O&A show  We're going to write him off the show  We're writing him off the show  It's a ratings grabber  It'll solve Earl's dilemma of having a problem with the way he's portrayed on this program  It works out for everybody  Less stress in your life, Earl  So we write him off the program  But there's so many different ways of doing it  We really got to figure this out  Hey, hey, you got me, guys  I'm back 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my God  It's you  We didn't expect it to be him  He was posing as Earl to try to change the format another time  Oh, my God  Oh, we rip it off and it's the old promotion guy  Hello  I was posing as Earl to get another satellite dish  Oh, if it wasn't for you meddling kids in Scooby-Doo 
[00:33:30]  I'd have gotten away with the DSL system  Hey, Scooby!  Yeah  How are you?  Ponderous  Hi  I'm Shaggy  Effing ponderous  Oh, yeah, Casey Kasem was Shaggy  The voice of Shaggy-Doo 
[00:34:00]  A little dog named Scooby-Doo  And what's up?  What you could do is send Earl into the woods  To film a documentary about wow  And you could call it the Black Witch Project  Or the Black Bitch Project  Because he whines so much  I shouldn't have come here  I'm dead  I'm dead  I'm sorry about wow, guys  I should have sent more stickers  I love you, Mom 
[00:34:30]  What is this?  There's a pile of self-adjusted stamped envelopes in front of the tent  They went there this morning  There's a pile of all around my tent  Big shot of him with snot running out his nose  And his eyes watering up  Better use a wide-angle lens  Oh, my God  That is awful  All right, Andy  Thanks  See you guys  Bye  Well, we're coming up with some great ways to write you off 
[00:35:00]  Oh, the listeners just coming up with a bunch of them  Have Earl go downstairs and reach for his wallet and get shot 40 times  Oh, my God  That's not funny  That's terrible  I'm just reading them as I sees them  Yeah  Like the sixth sense Earl was white the whole movie  Oh, my God  Well, well  How about like Elman Louise where he gets in the van 
[00:35:30]  Oh, he gets in the wow van and drives off a cliff?  Yeah, Earl  How do you want to go out?  Yeah, maybe we could just  Do you want to go out in a blaze of glory?  You want to leave the door open where you might come back?  Kind of like a George Clooney thing  You're in Seattle, but you might show up in the ER again  Big Yankee fan  You could get prostate cancer  We could kill you off every week like they do Kenny on Sound Park  Oh, that's a good idea, too  You killed Black Earl  You bastard 
[00:36:00]  You bastards  There's so many ways we could get rid of you  All right  I like the Kenny idea  The Kenny idea?  Well, then you're back every episode  Yeah  That might be a little much  Yeah  But he just dies so horrifically, though  This just came in  Earl could drive a car off a cliff while holding hands with Spaz  Just like Thelma and Louise  All right  Well, we got to think about it 
[00:36:30]  Oh, man, is that funny  I think he's got to go out like MASH, though, with Spaz coming in and making the announcement  Making an announcement with the touching departure instead of the wacky comedy departure  Yeah, like he leaves  There's the memories  We're all happy  We're happy he's going home  We're happy he's going to something he's going to enjoy a little better than the abuse of this program  Right  And then Spaz comes in and announces  And just a tragic twist of this 
[00:37:00]  Chopper went down  This chopper went down  You could see, like, as he's leaving  Spaz could be all teary and salute him  As Black Earl walks to the elevators  Right  And then walks down to the streets of New York  And waits three hours for a cab  And never shows up  And the camera just slowly fades all the way back  But you still see Earl trying to get that cab  But you just know inside, and he's going to be okay  And he's going to eventually get that cab  Taking off 
[00:37:30]  For some reason, he's in a helicopter  I have no clue why  Where is he going in the helicopter?  Back to Forest Hills  Back to Forest Hills  Yeah  Right, because he can't drive  And his new life  His new life in Forest Hills  And all of a sudden  Oh, my God  His stuff went down  There were no survivors  Yeah, but Spaz actually reports it laughing 
[00:38:00]  Because he hates black people  As you hear black girl crash  Stupid  Wait, Uncle John  Uncle John's got to go on  We've got to take a break here  But, Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, Owen  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, hey  I think you should make Earl into a Sims character  Lock him in a room and starve him to death  Every time he dies  You guys can go out and, like, cry at the tombstone once in a while  That's a good idea  That's a great idea  We'll put it all on the webcam  So you guys can watch him slowly starve himself to death  There you go 
[00:38:30]  All right, guys, rock on  Thank you, John  All right, enough of that  Yeah  So we'll think of something, Earl  Maybe it could be like  End of the first season of Sopranos  Where Big Pussy disappears  I don't know  I'm, quite frankly, not into the really leaving a door open thing  Yeah  I'm kind of into just writing you off  What happened to it at the end of the second season? 
[00:39:00]  We flew in a boat  Yeah  The boat ride  The boat ride  It's got to be the mash ending  That was the most dramatic  Yeah  Departure of a character in sitcom history  Everyone remembers that one  Yes  All right, Ant  We've got to take a break  But, Earl, thank you  We'll figure this out  And come up with a very dramatic  Your time is limited on this show  Honorable way to write  When is TV sweeps? 
[00:39:30]  We're in the middle of TV sweeps  So we can, like, drag this out three or four weeks, right?  Yeah  Right?  Of course  All right  We'll drag it out slowly but surely  We  Yeah, maybe that's it  Like, what was that?  James at 16  Remember that?  And then James at 17  And James at 18  Remember that old series back in the 70s, I think it was?  And he finally got laid  And that was the end of the program?  Because the whole thing was like how he was a virgin?  Yeah  Well  Earl  We got a virgin  So we'll have a storyline that Earl gets laid  Nah  That'll never work 
[00:40:00]  It's got to be believable  Earl at 29  Yeah, that's another thing  I'm thinking maybe  You've been a little out of sorts lately  Haven't you?  Yeah  Sick, yeah  When's the big 3-0 coming up, Earl?  28  28  That's kind of one of those little milestones  Wow  Little hurdle  I say we write him off the show on his 30th birthday  30th birthday  That's going to be a tough pill to swallow 
[00:40:30]  May 28  Turning 30  And you're written off the hottest radio show in New York  Yeah  It's a Sunday  It's a Sunday, yeah  Yeah  We'll work Sunday  We'll write you off on your 30th birthday  Oh my God  Happy birthday, Earl  Alright  Well, the title of the episode  Happy birthday, goodbye  A very special episode of Opie and Anthony  Goodbye, old friend  Goodbye, black Earl  Alright, let's take a break, okay?  Alright  Whip him out Wednesday

I wish you could just shut your pig's up  It's Whip him out Wednesday  Ooh, that's right  We'll be an Anthony  N-E-W  Anthony Ranch 1  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Ranch 1 helping us out with these WOW stickers  We're pigging out on Ranch 1 all the time 
[00:41:30]  They bring a bunch of food up here  I had the chicken fajita  The grilled chicken fajita Opie  Fresh peppers in there  Fresh tortilla wrap  Oh!  It's great  It's fast food  But it doesn't  It doesn't taste like fast food  It tastes great  It tastes fresh  It's healthy  So it's not like you're pigging out on greasy burgers or something  Even Opie eats it  Yeah, and I gotta tell you guys  I'm not a fast food restaurant type of guy  But I have no problem with the Ranch 1  Yeah  I had the grilled chicken over pasta 
[00:42:00]  It was very, very good  They're also the makers of the best grilled chicken sandwich on earth, Anthony, right?  Yeah  And we're doing a WOW sticker stop with Ranch 1 today  Yes, we are  Who's going to be giving out the stickers?  Earl  Earl  Well  Earl  Go see Earl  And that sticker's dum-dum  He only has four or five weeks left in his run here on the O&A show  So go see Earl  He's giving out the WOW stickers  Ranch 1  Park F South between 22nd and 23rd

Cool  Ranch 1, the best grilled chicken sandwich on earth  Try it today, you'll love it  The Opie and Anthony of Boobies and Whore Shop  By 7 o'clock, I think you're going to say  You know what?  I had a pretty good time today  1027 WNEW  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday, everybody 
[00:43:00]  We won't waste too much time on it today  Because the weather really does suck  But we're encouraging everyone to get a WOW on their car  And then of course we encourage the ladies to flash their lovely breasts  Ah, to the guys and some ladies out there that have WOW on their car  It's a cure-all  It would be greatly appreciated  Everyone loves seeing foreign boobs, Anthony  Yeah  It gives you that nice little thrill at the end of a long day, right?  Mm-mm  And if you still need a WOW sticker  Our own Earl 
[00:43:30]  Will be at the Ranch 1 location  Park Avenue South  Between 23rd and 24th, Anthony  Yeah  A little confusion there  But it's Park Ave South between 23rd and 24th  Ranch 1  For your Whip Them Out Wednesday stickers, okay?  Yep  All right  Really fast before we move on to other things  Dave has something  Dave, you're next on N.E.W.  Okay  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead, Dave  I think what you ought to guys do is like  Recreate the last scene from an officer, a gentleman  Where, like, Spence kicks open the door to the radio station 
[00:44:00]  Picks Black Earl up  And carries him out  While he's playing that song up wherever he belongs  He can put his Allison Chains hat on him  And then Stinky could be like  Way to go, WOW!  Way to go, WOW!  Way to go, WOW!  Way to go!  That's funny, Dave  We'll lift us up where we belong  Right  Do we have that song?  We can, like, uh  Yeah, play that song  Yeah, where is that song, man?  We're going to have to find it  No, Cocker?  Yeah, we'll find it  Where the eels fly 
[00:44:30]  On the mountain sky  Lift us up where we belong  Turn that goddamn radio down  Yeah, that's bothering us, Dave  Come on  Okay  We're trying to keep you on the air a little bit here  While we find the song  That's a good scenario, though, man  And then we could have some skanky bitch screaming  But I have no place else to go  As they go into the elevator, you know  Yeah  Yeah  Everybody's cheering 
[00:45:00]  The spaz is taking away Black Earl and his arms  Tears would be streaming down  Stinky's face, you know, as he claps  You go!  You go!  All right, thank you, Dave  I don't think we're going to find the song in time  All right, you guys have a nice day  That's very funny, though  Thank you  All right, let's go to Fabio  Fabio!  What's up, guys?  How are you?  All right, being that's Earl's 30th birthday just about  You could do a spoof on Logan's Run  Where everybody got killed off at 30 
[00:45:30]  Yeah  Oh, remember that?  Yes  So he's out of the land  And he could do, like, weekly updates  Where, you know, he's been seen  Where they could send the police after him  Called Earl's Run  Earl's Run  Earl's Run  Very good  Thank you, Fabio  Vindication by vindication  All right  God, we have the world's largest rag and roll library  We can't find out where we belong  Whatever that song is  Where the eagles fly  On a mountain  No, don't have it, huh? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, wow  Boy, you know, that rock and roll library's getting thinner and thinner  People are starting to take stuff out of it  You see gaping holes where it used to be full?  Because we don't play music anymore  It used to  Like, you would be able to tell if somebody took a CD  Because it would end up in the rotation sometime during the week  And it would have to be replaced  Or somebody would get screwed for it  But now that, like, it's very rare that music is played  There's gaping holes where people are just taking handfuls of CDs out of there  I couldn't find goddamn Joe's Garage yesterday 
[00:46:30]  We were looking for and we couldn't find it  I know  That's like a staple Frank Zappa album  Because we need a lot of those CDs still for our little dopey show  For our little comedy bits  These are comedy bits  And we accent them with the music sometimes  Wacky  Somebody is suggesting that we give Earl, like, a spin-off show  Michael  Oh  Yeah  Joni loves Chachi  You can do a spin-off show like, you know, the Black Earl Show  Yeah  Earl loves  A stupid thing like that 
[00:47:00]  And he just talks about how the days he used to be on Opie and Anthony  Yeah, Earl loves Spaz  Yeah  Yeah, that's a good idea  Alright  He can do the Frasier thing  All of a sudden he just has a talk show  Yeah  In Seattle  He's in Seattle  Totally changes the whole mood of the show  Right  Yep  Alright, man, thank you  Alright  Thanks, man  Alright, there he goes  Alright, now  Time to move on to other things, obviously  Yeah  Nicks looked great last night  Did they?  Yeah, you didn't watch, huh? 
[00:47:30]  No, I was looking at the invisible Jay Moore  on  Politically Incorrect  Politically Incorrect  If I get roped into watching that God-effing show one more time  I'm going to be so pissed off  Bill Maher is the worst  Bill Maher  And he's got to be introduced  And now the star of Politically Incorrect  The star  Bill Maher  He does three or four minutes of monologue  He can't even look into the camera  His jokes are so freaking lame  His jokes are so bad  And he's got a TV show  Yeah 
[00:48:00]  I get roped in for the past, what, three nights, two nights  Oh, Jay Moore is on tonight  Oh, he's on tonight, sorry  And I tuned in last night  And didn't know Jay Moore  You know, Jay Moore's appearance on Politically Incorrect  Is going to say a lot about Jay Moore the man  Yeah  Because you can see through that crappy show  I hope he challenges Bill Maher and everyone else  Yeah  Call him a jack-off  Anything  They wanted us to do something for Politically Incorrect 
[00:48:30]  And we're like, we'll have nothing to do with Bill Maher  And that stupid TV show of his  I shan't work with that man  I guess, what, he was filming in New York  And they wanted a lot of radio DJs, right?  And we were picked  So we would be the announcers on TV  Oh, really?  Yeah  And we'd probably have to say, you know, the star of the show  And now the star of the show  The star of Politically Incorrect  Bill Maher, everyone  Bill Maher  Bill Maher  Let's give it up  Hey, people in the studio audience here  Hello, hello 
[00:49:00]  We're going to be on the air now in about a minute  We're going to announce Bill Maher  We want you to really whoop it up big  For the TV show, okay?  Alright, we've got 45 seconds left  Really a big, big intro  When Bill takes the stage  You just really give it up for him, okay?  They've got to taunt the crowd  They've got to threaten them  Feed them candy bars  So they're all whipped into a frenzy  We went to a taping and that's what they do  They give people candy bars 
[00:49:30]  So they're like kids on speed  We got sucked into seeing Politically Incorrect  When it was on Comedy Central  We really didn't know much about the show  When we were in L.A.  And we got three tickets  And that's what they do  They feed the whole audience chocolate  To get them all hyper  They pass this huge bag of those chocolate crackle  You know that stuff?  Yeah  Which is just  It's on the border of being crack cocaine  This stuff is amazing  You just shovel that stuff in your mouth  It's great  But then  15 minutes later  You're like in that tight fist 
[00:50:00]  All you're hearing in your ears is  Like your ears are ringing  You couldn't make a fist  If your life depended on it  Your hands are swollen  You're just sweating  And the studio's like 10 degrees  But you're sweating  And then they want you to  They like preach to you  Okay, now when Bill comes out  You really give it up for him  And don't stop applauding  Once he gets out there  Because he's going to thank you  And nod his head  And wave  And thank you  You just keep applauding  Until the light goes off 
[00:50:30]  That says applaud  Okay, puppets  Are people  You ready?  And now the star  Bill Barr  Oh!  And you're like clapping  To the point of  It's ridiculous  Like you ever see  The end of a game show  When they're rolling the credits  And they just gotta  Keep applauding  It's like  Da-dun-dun  Da-dun-dun  Da-dun-dun  Oh!  Mark Goodson  Bill Todman Production  Woo!  I'm applauding for  Mark Goodson  Bill Todman  Oh, look  We're thanking  Spiegel Catalog  We're thanking everybody 
[00:51:00]  Thank you, Buick  And you're like  Oh, my hands hurt  Oh, they're all red  And then you start  Like nodding off  And the guy in the front  Of the crowd  Is like  Come on, more and more  Give it to us  And the applause  Oh, I gotta keep clapping  My hands are bleeding  Oh, there's blood  Splatting all over the seats  And the people in the show  They're like  They don't know where to look anymore  Yeah, they don't know where to look anymore  And the host is like  Leans over to the contestant  Blah, blah, blah  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  Oh, the contestant  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  Blah, blah, blah  What am I saying?  They do that on the news, too 
[00:51:30]  Yeah  Sometimes when they don't fade out in time  And the news reporters  Are just like  They're just standing there  Messing with their papers and stuff  And then they realize  Oh, my God  I'm still on camera  And they keep shuffling the papers  And it really starts getting really awkward  Here's hoping  Your time's a good time  Until next time  Right, right  Thank you  Good night  Right  And the camera pans away  And he's like  Alright, I'll just look at the paper  Until the camera goes away  I'm filing this over here 
[00:52:00]  Okay, give me my pen  I'll make like I'm writing a note  I did this story  About a minute ago  There we go  Oh, camera's still on  There's still rolling credits  You can still see me  Don't look at the camera  God, my nose itches  But I dare not scratch it  Dare not scratch it  I got cranky ass  Maybe I'll whisper something  To Kitee Tong  Yeah, Kitee  Nice can  Yeah, it's the 
[00:52:30]  What do I do  Until the camera goes off  Awkward moment thing  So, anyway  You're on a tangent, though  Bill Maher  Yeah  Jay Moore  Politically Incorrect  Yeah, he's supposed to be on  Now what, rumor is  What, Friday?  Friday, yeah  He's not going to be on  Somebody call Jay Moore  And have him  Yeah, could somebody ask  Have him tell us  When he's going to be on  Politically Incorrect  Let's see  Bill Maher acts like  He's such a hot ass  But do you remember  He did that semi-porn movie  Paradise Vacation 
[00:53:00]  No, I don't remember that  I don't remember that either  No, I don't remember that  Anthony  Bill Maher  Yuck  All right  Pompous F  Uh, John, what's up?  Hey  Hey, Yellow  What's up?

[00:59:30]  With Earl and Psycho Mark  Alright  They'll be checking in soon  Anthony  Yeah  Hmm  Well  I'm just reading  The guy  I know  The news  The news is uh  I know  That's what I was waiting for  I don't know  I don't know  What that means  So  I don't either  Okay  Anthony  Yeah  The mayor of New York City  Rudy Giuliani  And his wife  Donna Hanover  Are planning to separate  Discussing a separation  That news came from the mayor today 
[01:00:00]  Giuliani  Appeared visibly shaken  When discussing the issue  With some reporters  He was visibly shaken  Because he was trying to figure out  How much money he's gonna lose  Oh  You think the prostate thing  Is an invasive procedure  Believe me  They go up the same pipe  They go up the same pipe  With a fist  Yeah  One is a delicate medical instrument  Right  And another one is just  The girl's lawyer's fist 
[01:00:30]  So  Pulling your innards out  Pulling as much money as they can out  Much cash  Rudy  Godspeed Rudy  Rudy Giuliani  Yeah  Said uh  Just moments ago I guess  That he and his wife  For 16 years  Donna Hanover  Are discussing a formal separation  Donna and I  In many ways  Lead independent  And separate lives  Yeah where is it  Donna and I  In many ways  Lead independent  And separate lives 
[01:01:00]  It has been  A painful road  Is he talking about  The divorce  Or is that  A painful  Old dirt road  And I'm hoping  That we'll be able  To formalize  That in an agreement  That protects our children  Give them all the security  And protection they deserve  And makes the death star  The strongest power  In the universe  He emphasized that he and Hanover 
[01:01:30]  Are working on a separation agreement  A separation agreement  Is not a divorce  He added  He's a wonderful person  And an extraordinary mother  I'm very sad  And feel terrible  They're working on an agreement  What a load  No they're not  Now that Donna knows  That Rudy's getting his  His thingy  You know what  Yeah  She's gonna go for the gusto  Well yeah  Rudy's uh  Rudy's prostate therapy 
[01:02:00]  Comes in the form of a  Judy Stish  I guess  Huh  It's glad  You're gonna see that  The mayor's not a cyborg  And that he is human  And that he's getting  His willy sucked  Oh  Whoa  I thought the guy  Wasn't human for a while  There Anthony  Judith Nathan  Her name is  The mayor's  Very good friend  Very good friend  Who's gonna be brave enough  To write what  What she really is 
[01:02:30]  To the mayor  A good friend  A JB  A JB is what she is  That's all  A good friend  She's a JB  Anthony  A JB  Bucket  Oh my  Oh  Oh my god  Well this is  This is in perfect form  With this whole  Giuliani marriage  The way it's been  For a while  More  Smoke and mirrors  As they say  They make it sound like  Well we're discussing  Separation 
[01:03:00]  Oh it's not a divorce  Oh  That's what everyone says  You know that  The separation thing  Is a big crock  Of crap  People  It's  It's done by people  Who want to appear  That they're not  Getting divorced  No you're getting divorced  We're separating  You know  It's a load of crap  It's a load of crap  Dive right in  Yeah  Dive right in  To the wonderful world  Of divorce mayor 
[01:03:30]  We have George  From the NYPD  On the line  George  Hey how you doing guys  Good  I just hope  His wife  Takes everything  He gave himself  A nice little raise  The last time  Ouch  Gave us nothing  I hope he should  Take him for everything  He's got  You guys must be  Laughing today  She has her own career  Say that again George  We're giggling  Like little school girls  Yeah I imagine you are  Maybe he should  Take some of her cash  You know  She's got a career 
[01:04:00]  She's got a career  Well I'm just  Hey come on  What am I going to go  Against the guy on this  She has a god damn career  She's on movies  And TV  And the vagina monologues  You think Rudy's wife  Had something to do  With his career  Vagina  The vagina monologues  Vagina  Yeah  I didn't see her  At any of those  Town hall meetings  You know  I didn't see her  Cleaning up the crime  On the streets  No  No 
[01:04:30]  I didn't see any of that  But now she's going  To come forward  And probably say  That she's entitled  To his cash  Because she was  An integral part  Of his career  What a load of crap  That is  She had nothing  To do with his  God damn career  I want to make  That clear  Here  Wow  Why are you so  I'm talking about  The mayor  Sure  Everything on the outside  That I have seen  Yeah  Points to the fact  That she had nothing  To do with his career  Nothing 
[01:05:00]  So you get pissed off  When people say  That they had something  To do with someone's career  When they did not  I'm just talking  About the mayor  Oh okay  That's all  As far as I see  The mayor  Got where he is today  In his career  Yeah  With no help  From Donna Hanover  None whatsoever  None whatsoever  None  None  I'd go as far as to say  She might have been  Detrimental to his career  By not being  The doting wife  That he needed  To advance  His political aspirations 
[01:05:30]  We're still talking  About the mayor here  The mayor  Okay I'm just checking  Mayor  Mayor  Right  The mayor  The mayor  Of course  Yes  Well he's got  A fun little thing  He thinks that  A prostate thing  Is going to be bad  Wait until two fists  He's two fists deep  Hey Tom  What's up  Up to the elbows  Hey what's up  Anthony  Yeah  Yes  First let me say  You guys are fantastic  Uh oh  Uh you were talking  Yesterday about  Giuliani  With the lightbulb head

No of course  And this is all courtesy of what?  Of you  Of your company?  Yes  I'm not saying it  It's so funny because Anthony's bringing more and more stuff to the show  Hoping that we'll plug it  You know  That's not true  Bringing us four lesbians that are going to fool around with hot wax 
[01:22:00]  And on the lesbian couch  I think you definitely, finally have earned a plug  I would say so  On the O&A show  Anthony agrees with me  So why don't you take that mic Anthony  I don't trust you  Let her rip  Let her rip  It's prom season  Four girls  How can we, you know, mess with you now?

Yeah, I'm a cop in this city  Listen  This is hysterical  What's going on with Giuliani  I hope she takes him for every dime he's got  I hope he gets stuck with the little fat bastard  Because it's going to cost him an arm in the lake to feed him  A couple of years ago at the World Series  He ate 12 hot dogs  Really?  The guys saw it on camera  All he did was put his pudgy pork chop arm over his shoulder  And he had a hot dog in his hand  The kid is unbelievably fat 
[01:23:30]  How about last season when he reached out to grab that fly ball and almost fell onto the field  Rudy had to grab him and pull him back in  You know, like six guys trying to hold him  Yeah, because he would have been ejected from the game  Those are the rules, man  And the other thing  You know, it's kind of funny now  Safe is coming up with the prostate cancer  You think Giuliani might have given it to him from a little  Butt sex  I don't think so  That's a little much 
[01:24:00]  Butt sex  Thank you  In the case of, yeah, good luck  Take it easy  That SNL skit where Farley played Giuliani's kid  Yeah, man  One of the funniest things ever  Too freaking funny  Let's go to line 10 and talk to Robert  Robert, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  You've got to get Donna Hannell on the show  To let you know what Giuliani's like in bed  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Yeah, that'll happen right here on our very program 
[01:24:30]  Of course  Come on  It'd be perfect, though  She could get some  Anthony could do the imitations  She'll fall in love with them  And that'll be it  How are we going to pull that one off?  I don't know  She's a media whore  Come on  She don't like everything  And then one of our listeners could go out on a date  Oh, that sounds vaguely familiar  With Donna Hanover  And then she could drive a car into a garage  And leave it running  You guys got to do me one favor, though  Before I get caught 
[01:25:00]  I got to hear that Timmy thing  Where is that from?  Oh, the Timmy  Timmy  Timmy  Timmy  Timmy now, let me know  Come on  Timmy now, let me know  I've been dying  But yeah, you've got to get her on there  It'd be perfect, though  All right, Robert  We'll work on that  Yeah, well, we've turned down the offer  To have her on the show ten times  Maybe we'll pick it up  And say, yeah, sure  Yeah  Come on, give me a Timmy, though  You got it?  If you would shut up  You would have heard it  We played five times while you were talking  Let me know  Let me know 
[01:25:30]  Come on  Thanks, you guys rock, man  All right, Robert  Take it easy  Bye  Fad-type, trendy character  To imitate on South Park  In a wheelchair, right?

What is that?  What is that?  Does anyone know what he's doing on VH1?  He's got his pimp suit on  Wait, let's ask Tanya  Tanya, what is Jay Moore doing on VH1?  Well, he's doing Saturday Night Live reviews when they have the best of Saturday Night Live 
[01:27:30]  Yeah  I put it on here, he's doing Kenny G, he's doing one of these boy bands, he looks so stupid  He looks so stupid  What's Jay doing?  Wearing his impersonations, but he's hosting and that's what they got him doing  So Anthony, you were looking for him on TV, he's on VH1 right now  Now, this isn't a repeat, this is brand new Jay Moore stuff on VH1?  Well, I've never seen it before  Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen Jay Moore hosting the SNL skits 
[01:28:00]  All right, Tanya, thank you  All right  Bye  Boy, you know, you don't realize how lucky John Lennon was getting shot until you see Paul McCartney now  You know?  Now, before you all pounce on me, really think about that  Has anyone seen Paul McCartney recently?  How do you remember John Lennon?  New York t-shirt on, the little round John Lennon glasses, long hair, he's just coming back from the studio  Walking around Manhattan, he's very New York 
[01:28:30]  Right?  Sure  That's how you remember him, because that was the last we saw of him  The last image  How do you remember Paul McCartney, who's still rolling around?  He's like Paula McCartney now  I think that guy's like, needs some testosterone  It's like he's getting estrogen injections or something  He's with the one-legged chick  And if you're one of the Beatles, I think you can do better than a one-legged chick  Right?  I was a beetle  No, I'm sure she's a lovely lady 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's just the look thing  Remember that?  Do you remember an old painting done of the Beatles?  It was like one of those lithographs of what they would all look like when they got older  When they turned 65?  Yeah, it was the four of them, all like head shots of them turning older  You've got to get getting older  64?  Yeah  When I'm 64?  Yeah, when they were 64  And the real life is worse than the picture was  And he's not even 64 yet 
[01:29:30]  He's not even 60 yet  It's taking its toll  I don't know what  You are so scared to grow old  Eat a goddamn hamburger, Paul  The wife's gone  Linda's gone  He needs some protein or something  Need some red meat  Get a burger  Have a veal chop or something  Don't worry  No one's gonna smack you  I bet he wanted a burger  Oh, Jesus Christ  All I want is a burger  I just want a piece of meat 
[01:30:00]  Paul, where are the carrots?  I'm just ragging them all the time  Poor little bunnies  And the poor little cows  And the poor little chickens  Oh, for the love of Christ  I'm a beetle  I can't even have a hot dog  But I love her, Christ  She's dead  Pig out  It's affecting the way he looks, I think

[01:44:30]  see how  how far you want  to take it  that'll be easy  right  sounds good to me  okay good  very nice  uh Anthony  remember yesterday  there was a guy  that uh  he wants a copy  of this one prank  from uh  Demento World  oh which one  we were supposed  to play this yesterday  so as we go to break  we'll play it real fast  all right  it was uh  it was a prank call  we made to Green Bay  when the Packers  were in the Super Bowl  um  and we called  the funeral home  because Anthony  your father  died just before 
[01:45:00]  the Super Bowl  yes  and uh  we had to do  something with him  because he was  a big Packers fan  and uh  someone out there  wants a copy  so why don't you  hit record  and you'll have it  here we go  okay  hello  yes Anthony  okay  uh  my name's  Artie Milo  and uh  my father  recently passed away  did your dad  pass away  did you say  yes  yes he did  when was that  I don't know  two three days ago  okay  now he wanted to  watch the Super Bowl  with his family  uh huh 
[01:45:30]  and we just want to know  if there's a way  you can come over  and like you know  temporarily  you know prop him up  in the big chair  so when the family  comes over  he'll be okay  until after the Super Bowl  and then we'll bury him  no we can't do that  Mr. Milo  oh it was his one  dream to watch  the Packers  in the Super Bowl  and we already  painted his face  green and gold  no I  but it would  you mean  not get him  until then  yeah well  you could come over  and maybe you know  pump him 
[01:46:00]  with whatever you do  and uh  you know  preserve him  until after the bowl  no I'm afraid  we just can't  do it  why  it was his dream  you know  to watch the  the Packers  in the bowl  uh huh  and we've been  holding on to him  for a couple of days  now  he's been in the barn  but you know  the coyotes  have been a nipping  and I don't think  he's going to make it  until Sunday  no he died  who knows  that he has died  hopefully uh  no one  but we just want you  to come over  and you know  prop him up  in the chair  and maybe open up  his hand  and so we can  put a beer in there 
[01:46:30]  and we can't  we can't do that  we can't embalm  anybody  embalm  that's the word  and once they're  embalmed  they can't be  you know  they can't be  in a sitting position  you know  it just kind of  well he's been  in a sitting position  now and he's  getting kind of hard  but if you could  maybe do something  and then lay him  down later  we'd even be up  to you know  if you've got to  break something  it's okay  no we don't do that  it was his one  lifetime dream  to see the pack  in the bowl  with his family  and we got the  big screen tv  and the chair for him  and he went up  and died  we will not do that 
[01:47:00]  if your dad has died  and if you really  have not notified  anybody  you do have to do that  you have to have  the medical examiner's  approval  to take him away  ok look  what if we put  the coffin  in the house  and put the tv  on the coffin  that way he'll be  with the family  is there a law  or something  no if he was  embalmed  and if he was  you know  able  if there's no  problem as far  as preserving him  right  and could you put  like a pack  banner in his hand  because it was 
[01:47:30]  his dream  to see the packs  in the bowl  we could probably  do that  you could put  a pack  well that's ok  I don't know  if we could have  a visitation  in the house  depending on how  well he preserved  he was  and if we could  get a casket  into the house  but once he's  embalmed  he is  laying down  right  ok do you think  that's like  degrading  if we put  the cheesehead  hat on him  do you want  me to call  the medical  examiner  for you  oh no  that might  not be  a good idea  then we'd  have to  try to  explain  where his  feet went  bye  oh 
[01:48:00]  p and anthony  who would  you rather  nail  i disqualify  myself  because i  done  them  both  1027  wnew  it's the  ona show  212  757  1027  hanging out  we got a bunch  of girls  that want to  get hot wax  today anthony  i think we'll  have the girls  do each other  today  oh that's  interesting  something different  all right  we gotta get  that lesbian  for a day  thing happening  as well  we haven't  had any

[01:54:30]  to be cool  and i used to like  that he came out  he's bald  luke graham  oh exactly  didn't he have like  some kind of  brain thing happen  most definitely  didn't he have like  an aneurysm or  something in his brain  i think he had one  on stage on saturday  farner  rah  joe walsh came  i've been waiting  he looked like  john wangacy  oh girl like you  god  john wangacy  wait joe walsh  looks like  john wangacy  you would not  believe it was

[02:05:00]  i don't know  now they play  places like the  westbury music fair  and little clubs  and uh  they just look  awful  and most of the  times sound awful  and i don't know  if you want to  stay in music  you go into like  writing songs  for movies maybe  behind the scenes  stuff  you can't get out  and rock  like i said before  blue oyster cult  totally pissed me  off  it was horrible  remember seeing  them at the  black and blue  show in the  garden  and it was  great 
[02:05:30]  and then you  hear they're  coming around  it's like oh  cool  you go there  and it's like  that's a blue  oyster cult  and then some  of the guys  just flat out  turned gay  turned gay  gay in the sense  it's just  like what are  you doing  i mean phil collins  he was in  genesis obviously  he was rocking  that's a big  genesis ever got  but back then  that was  i mean when  genesis first  started phil collins  first took the helm  and you know  they were doing  some stuff 
[02:06:00]  you know they  were awesome  a lot of people  would agree  and then slowly  but surely  genesis got really  really wimpy  as the albums  kept coming out  every two or three  years  as the strip on  his head got thinner  and thinner  he's got to give up  on that damn thing  it's it  it's over phil  it's like striped  from gremlins  yeah it's over  that's all it is  he's holding on  for dear life  but that thing  is gone man  strip on his head  the cute  the cute  what was that  serial again  the um  a quisp  quisp  thank you  yeah it's time 
[02:06:30]  to get rid of  the quisp look  but  quisp  and then he  would do the  solo albums  and he was getting  gayer  and gayer  and gayer  and now he's writing  for motion pictures  for Disney films  the Tarzan  Oscar winning  Tarzan theme  do you need an Oscar  that bad  that you get an Oscar  for you know  writing a song  for a Disney film  well I guess when  don't you have any  pride mind  you get some years  under your belt  like that  your outlook  on things change  all of a sudden  like these rock  guys  they don't care 
[02:07:00]  you think like  Billy Corrigan  eventually is going to be  yeah  writing you know  songs for Disney films  dude it won't be long  you'll be hearing  CBS FM  it's the Smashing Pumpkins  your favorite  oldies  it'll be an oldie  hey CBS FM  bullet with butterfly wings  CBS  well this is  Pearl Jam  it's going to happen 
[02:07:30]  well this discussion  all started  because the Who  now they're  they're going out  on tour again  they're playing  PNC Arts Center  July 1st  Jones Beach  July 10th  but they're also  doing this benefit  that just pisses me off  they're charging  $2,000 a ticket  it was cool  when they used to  kill themselves  you know  OD and stuff  you know  because I  guarantee  if Jim Morrison  was still alive  you'd be sad  for the man 
[02:08:00]  right  be an old guy  spinning around  on that friggin  turntable stage  at Westbury Music Fair  I'm dizzy  you know  that it would  be untrue  you know  that I  ow  I'm going to  puke  stop the spinning  come on baby  change my  colostomy bag  Dave  is going to  make a good  point here  Dave  what's up  yeah listen  these rock stars  weren't supposed  to live this long  I was  watching

[02:09:00]  to remember them  the way they were  then  well then go back  to your houses  or your castles  that you bought  in England  or practice  your god damn  witchcraft  whatever you want  to do  but just stay hidden  you owe it  to your fans  man  it's like  when you read  about what the  cream and the  starch and the  drugs and the  crazy stuff they did  you get a contact  high just reading  about it  yeah  you know  they weren't  supposed to last  this long  but now they  need the money  alright Dave 
[02:09:30]  thank you  ok man  and a lot of  people they'll  go see the  who  they're going  to go  wow you know  it's going  to be like  old times  going to put  on my  who  my who  t-shirt  my who  concert t-shirt  check out  this week's  Moesha  as Jimi Hendrix  guest stars  as Moesha's  granddad  you know  Tommy can you  hear me  where's my  goddamn  hearing aid  Tommy can you  see me  I can't

[02:10:30]  Timber.  Tommy.  Timber.  Tommy, can you hear me?  Oh, let me know.  Let me know.  Come on.  Can I hear you?  It's over, man.  It's over, man.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Let's go.  Punch out, Maverick.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  A couple of years ago, a friend of mine won tickets to see Frampton at Westbury.  And, I mean, Frampton's all right, but the funny thing was the audience, like, the 50  and 60-year-old people dusting off the denim jacket with the painted Frampton on the back 
[02:11:00]  and the journey, and they're rocking away.  And we were just like, man, what is with these people?  I mean, he had a good buzz on, so that made it all right.  Yeah.  But the fans were more funny than Frampton.  He was all right.  It's really kind of frightening, especially when a long time passes between the time where  you see him a while ago and you see him now, which is like The Who.  Oh, yeah.  I saw The Who back in, like, the early 80s, and then I saw The Who a couple of years back  when they did the Quadrophenia tour.  And I walk in the place up in Boston, and the audience is like, oh, my God. 
[02:11:30]  I remember these were like, going to these concerts with my friends from high school.  It would be like, you'd go out during lunch to Ticketmaster.  Hey, did you get the tickets?  And, you know, hand them out to everyone that gave you the money.  And then you walk in there, and it's like, ooh, how did my friend's parents get in here?  Oh, my God.  That's what it was like, man.  It was like the parents in there also.  And the chicks that still try to dress like they did back then?  Exactly.  Which is really bad. 
[02:12:00]  I mean, the guys are still in the Who t-shirt that they bought, and it's all shrunk, and  their bellies are hanging out.  Back in the closet.  Yeah, the moths have been eating at it for the last 10 years.  There's holes all over.  It's barely material anymore.  But we're holding on to our youth.  And the chicks are, like, trying to pull off that look, and that ain't quite working.  And they cram it into the mini skirts that they had on back then?  Yeah, yes.  All right, man.  Could you guys do me a quick favor?  Yeah.  Could you ask Earl what high school his Invisible Man went to? 
[02:12:30]  Because I think my Invisible Man knows him.  All right.  We'll ask Earl.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  When I used to work in the hair salon, we got four broads outside the studio.  Yeah.  We just mic'd them.  You just put a mic in there.  Because during commercials, we were going to the bathroom, and the crap they're talking  about, it's like, oh, my God.  If you could eavesdrop.  I don't think they have a brain between them.  Four dancers.  Listen to this.  They're going to do a hot wax show a little later for us.  Let's listen.  I cannot deal with the waxing down there. 
[02:13:00]  That's thick hair.  And it comes, oh.  It's not like you're my fashion.  How do you feel about this?  I pluck it.  He shaves his balls.  I pluck it.  I'm like, he waxes his ass from time to time.  He shaves his balls.  Oh, he shaves his balls.  I don't know how much of that was on the air.  I don't know how much of that was on the air. 
[02:13:30]  They're about shaving balls and a-holes.  All right, they're talking about shaving yam bags.  They're talking about shaving balloon knots.  All right, let's go back up.  Oh, boom.  Shh.  Hold on, Ann.  That is real sensitive.  You've got to be careful, because it's, like, so thick.  I know.  Oh, my God.  I did a banister party once.  This is the best.  You know what I'm like, kid?  Shh, shh, shh.  Oh, my God.  What a freak. 
[02:14:00]  What?  What?  We're going to go to the Van Halen tune soon.  He looks more straight.  In front of all his friends.  We're dumbing out.  Vaginas.  We're dumbing out like crazy, but we could translate that.  Panuses.  What are they talking about?  I guess a guy that pulls his yam bag to make it look like bat wings.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  And then proceeds to, I guess, yeah, put his face near the yam bag.  Same thing you would do to an ice cream cone.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah, to the yam bag.  They have no clue that we have this hidden microphone.  All right, wait a second.  We can't get...  All right, hold on.  They can't go two seconds without saying something that we're probably getting dumped out of.  Oh, my God.  No, we're not off the air.  No, no. 
[02:15:00]  We still have a light over here, so we're still okay.  We got some dump.  Wait, they might be on to us.  Are they on to us?  They're still talking about licking yam bag.  Don't say on to us.  No, no, Anthony, Anthony, just say it.  Well, we'll know when they're...  I'm hearing we're on our last leg as far as dump goes before the Van Halen song.  He, like, put his balls over there every time. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Does she love saying that word?  There's one girl that loves yam bags out there.  That's all I can tell you.  Oh, my God.  How many times has that word been used?  A hundred.  We're getting the uncut version of this, and we'll be able to bleep it, right?  Good.  Well, I don't think that got through.  Boy, have you ever wondered what strippers talk about when they're not dancing? 
[02:16:00]  Damn it.  Like, oh, phew.  Well, that was something we couldn't put on the air.  Let's try again.  If you're listening, come and say it right away.  You're not.  All right, all right.  I actually was the power of attorney on that one and dumped out, okay?  Yeah, they dumped out, yeah.  They're discussing guys giving themselves oral. 
[02:16:30]  I think you could say that.  Isn't that interesting?  When we potted that up, I thought they were going to talk about how the NAS was down 200 points today.  But, no, they're talking about yam bags and shweens and everything else.  Penises.  Vaginas.  Butt sex.  Yes.  All right.  Let's try this one more time.  I forget what it looks like.  This candle looks really good, though. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, I got a penis in my bag.  Wait a minute, that's why I got the...  That's why I got the...  Okay, for water, you'd be like, I want to come grow a teca.  Just put in water.  I said, well, look, how big it is.  That's what it was.  They're just talking about getting banged.  It's amazing.  That's all they talk about.  It's banging and sucking and effing and sucking.  The one said she brought her own male member in her pocketbook. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  I think this is working as long as we translate, no?  Well, thank you.  It doesn't slap you in the face.  And it can't cheat.  That's right.  And it don't cheat.  Amen.  Amen.  That's the best thing.  Hi, how are you?  They're talking about vibrators and how they don't talk back to you and they don't cheat on you.  Yeah.  That could be there.  No, that's okay.  I'll take it.  I don't know.  It just looks nice.  She's making conversation.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  Take care. 
[02:18:00]  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  It's a long book-bye.  Bye-bye.  What happened to Sharon?  Sharon, what are you doing in the bathroom?  It's a couple of goods down.  What are you doing?  I don't know how they're still there.  I don't know how they're still there.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  She's melting her lollipop.  Penis.  Penis.  Yeah, she's got lollipop penis.  Phew.  God damn it. 
[02:18:30]  I wish we could clean them up because it's just hilarious.  Yeah.  Half this crap's not even getting on the air.  No way, Jose.  Go in the bathroom.  You can hear everything.  Are you kidding me?  No.  But I want to hear what they're talking about.  They want to know.  Someone didn't turn down the bathroom.  They might be saying terrible things to them.  That's the question.  I want to know more about that guy that did it that sucks himself.  Dude, man.  What was his name?  Someone didn't turn down the monitor in the bathroom. 
[02:19:00]  One of the girls went to the bathroom and heard and now they're on to us.  And then look at what she says.  She's like, they're saying terrible things about you.  What did we say?  We didn't say anything.  You didn't say anything.  Listen with your ears, not your...  All right.  Ah, Frank, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, that was the best private show on hold.  Oh, yeah, because all the people on hold got to hear all the...  Oh, cool.  ...the show before it gets stomped. 
[02:19:30]  Cool.  If you could figure out a way to bug the dressing room at Privilege,  that'd be the best radio ever.  Oh, without a doubt.  What I want to talk about, do you guys remember a band called Bachman?  I saw BTO open for Van Halen in the late 80s.  Yeah.  Oh, they waddled out on the stage.  And they were just huge.  Do you guys remember from when we were kids,  the Guinness Book of World Records,  the world's two fattest twins on the motorbikes? 
[02:20:00]  Of course.  That's what they looked like, trying to reach around.  They grabbed the guitar with their stubby little fingers.  Bachman Turner, overweight.  Oh, and they were trying to sing, and they were like,  we still rock.  And they were like, no.  The only business they were taking care of was eating.  We still rock.  If you've got to get up there and say we still rock, you don't.  They had on these really bad baby blue coveralls,  you know, like that old guys wear.  Oh, man.  I guess they thought they looked hip, but they just looked fat. 
[02:20:30]  BTO.  Anyway, guys, that's all I got.  You're having a good show.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Yeah, I'm taking care of breakfast.  It's a mini-me.  It's a mini-me.  He called me a mini-me.  He called a mini-me, and Minnie's been missing them over here.  You've heard a conversation about this?  No, why?  They're talking about, radio's talking about this.  All right.  Okay. 
[02:21:00]  You can't go five seconds without a whole room.  Curse all the strippers without them cursing.  Go figure.  I thought we'd pot it up and hear something like,  so that's the cure for cancer.  Right.  Oh, we missed it.  Damn.  They're like, they might be onto us.  Let's act dumb again.  I heard Brady's big mouth.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  Brady's big mouth.  Brady's big mouth. 
[02:21:30]  How did I get my point across?  I don't think there's a possibility that they might not put you on.  All right.  Because they're extending it a little bit, so I don't know.  What is Anthony doing?  No, they don't.  What a loser.  What is he doing?  He might not put you on.  We told him, don't go out there.  Don't talk to the girls.  Let me take care of it.  I'll take care of it.  I'm Spaz Senior.  He's Spaz Senior, yeah.  Hey, Matt, what's going on? 
[02:22:00]  My dad.  What's going on, guys?  I am your father.  I went to see Jethro Tull in September.  Right before we went, me and my friend, we bought a video of them from their concert.  In 1976, they were tearing the place apart.  Yeah.  I swear to God, we got onto them.  They were off for 45 minutes.  We and Anderson practically had to be carted off.  We did Aqualong in about 10 seconds.  It was absolutely pathetic.  We didn't know whether to trash the place or call an ambulance.  All right, Matt. 
[02:22:30]  Take it easy.  Bye.  That's probably because he was out of breath from playing the flute.  Yeah, you can't play the flute like you used to, right?  I write down every party I do, so I know if I check backlog it, I'll get it.  Yeah, right?  I'll bring him over here.  These girls can't talk without cursing.  They can't talk two seconds without cursing.  Not two effing seconds.  They log all their bachelor parties, and they write down what they do at each bachelor party.  They're dead.  It's like a set list. 
[02:23:00]  A set list.  A little set list.  Okay, I'm going to start with the small one.  Write down small, one.  One, small.  Okay, then second, we're going to do fist.  Third, lesbo.  Fourth, ping pong balls.  And for the encore, we're going to do the anal intruder.  The only thing we're not talking about that Giuliani situation.  That is so annoying.  They've been talking about it forever.  She's probably saying that.  Really?  I want to know if it's going to blow up.  I know nothing.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
[02:23:30]  Giuliani does nothing for me.  I know.  I want to know if he's going to blow up yet.  Yeah, politics, too.  Like, we're talking about it forever.  Oh, look, you're getting good now.  He's an idiot.  He closed down my favorite closet.  Pataki's cooler than you.  I don't even know what Pataki does.  I got them all.  Yay!  That's so bad, baby.  What?  She got them all?  You got the...  Hey, wait a minute.  She got the, um...  It went like that.  I got them all. 
[02:24:00]  You got her?  Wait, how did I do it?  You were like...  This trip has disgusted me, man.  I'm sorry.  Why are you going to do the ring?  You know what they're doing out there?  You got to give the visual.  They're playing ring toss with a, uh...  A penis.  A penis.  You know something?  When they're dancing, it's all well and fine.  When you're standing there, you're sitting there in a club.  You're putting dollar bills down the cheese string.  It's all fine and dandy. 
[02:24:30]  When you get a gaggle of them babbling like that, I'm friggin' disgusted.  I want to vomit.  What are they all screaming?  Daddy, come on!  It's me.  Now you know what you're paying for.  Did you feel bad about it?  No, I didn't, John.  Oh, John, I hope you got that one.  You know what?  Now you know what you're paying for when you go to the strip club.  You're paying for them to shut the F up.  To take your clothes off, dance, and don't friggin' open your yaps. 
[02:25:00]  God damn.  Like, I'm getting all pissed listening to them.  I'm getting worked up.  Like, every time they curse, I'm like, would you stop cursing you, friggin' idiots?  God.  Did you have a fantasy bringing one of these home and marrying them?  What a coonot.  The tip is the most sensitive part.  That's right.  That's the best part.  That's right.  Shut up!

I hear his head off.  We just...  God damn.  I think we're just entertaining ourselves because they're dumping out every single line that they're saying out there.  We're getting close.  All they're talking about is, like, just sucking this, sucking that. 
[02:26:00]  It's funny, regular...  Just because you're...  A C expert.  A C expert.  Unbelievable.  Can they go five seconds without cursing?  Five seconds?  No.  Let's try.

They used to have sitting on my hot meat.  You're looking at the answers already?  That's not fair.  Come on, read it.  It's against the law for animals to copulate in public in Stanfield, Oregon.  What does copulate mean? 
[02:32:00]  What's the hell do I know?  Oh, nothing.  No, it's not because they don't know.  Wait a minute.  The last time I was on the show, I said spontaneity.  No, wait.  Spontaneity is so spontaneity.  Why don't you look at me like that?  Oh, I didn't know.  Do you like the answer?  Yes.  She doesn't know what copulate is.  How are the animals going to know they can't come up with animals?  They can't take that for the cousins.  And the father's and the daughter is here.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, we're getting some instant feedback. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Filthy, stupid, ignorant, disgusting, repulsive animals.  Who wants to be a dumb whore?  Goodbye, boner.  That one girl laughs like the chick from the nanny, yeah.  That stupid bitch sounds like Chandler Bing's old girlfriend.  Ah, Chandler.  All right, we've got to move on.  People are hating this.  Oh, there you go. 
[02:33:00]  You know something?  We like to tear away the walls, the curtains, the mystique of the stripper.  Now, any guy out there would probably be like, oh, wouldn't it be cool to, you know,  backstage at a strip club or in a room full of strippers and hear what they talk about?  I bet it's hot.  I bet it.  No.  You know what it is?  It's nothing.  It's this.  I got one.  The testicles can increase in size about 100%.  You're a boss.  Tecticles?  I don't think so. 
[02:33:30]  You're a boss.  The girl's got it right.  And you got one.  What?  No.  See?  No.  That's what you're going to get.  That's what you're getting.  Not talk about frilly lingerie and nice evenings of sex.  Not anything.  Not anything.  I swear to God, I've had discussions with sea urchin that have been more compelling.  A female cannot have an erection.  So they don't know this is a man writing these questions. 
[02:34:00]  Wait a minute.  No, I thought I got the woman because it hurts.  Holy mother of God.  Did you have my name?  I thought it got small because it hurt.  You know.  Ann, explain that one because I don't know if that made it, man.  She thought when the most sensitive portion of the woman's genitalia got swollen, it was 
[02:34:30]  because it was sore because she was with a guy that was so big.  It's a rat.  Anyway, okay.  Next question.  Your next question.  Wait.  Hold on.  I got one.  Hold it.  What's my name?

Skipping through life with your shoelaces untied.  What happened to the mail race?  The pleasure.  The happiness.  They're more natural.  They're like close to...  Well, it's small.  How could it be?  Well, they can't do a split.  Wait.  When the scrotum is cold, it...

Oh, gosh.  He didn't even know that.  The second testicle question he can't answer.  When strippers are talking, the penis...  A retracts into the body like a tortoise head. 
[02:36:30]  Stop the choices.  It's A.  You read it.  I like the answer.  Even though I can't answer anything.  Go ahead.  Please read it.  He's nervous now.  Come on.  Read.  He's standing here.

It rhymes with the reflective glass thing, a prism.  Right.  Only it's meant for the male stuff.  At a dump.  We're at a dump.  We're at a dump.  We're at a dump.  She keeps popping that magic word on.  The J word.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  Casey Kasem checking it open.

Now, if you're paying me.  Come on, guys.  True.  True.  It helps my nipples.  My nipples are on stage.  My nipples are pierced, so that helps them stay on stage. 
[02:41:00]  That is a good way to go through the questions, to sort it out.  Right.  Oh, good.  Now they're dealing with how to answer a question.  Sort it out.  Oh, my.  What?  We're out?  I never knew.  John's panicking in the dump room.  I don't blame him today.  I really, really never knew.  We were seconds away from the Van Halen song, I'm hearing.

[02:42:00]  There's going to come a time.  Delays back up.  Delays back up?  Okay.  There's going to come a time, right, where they're not going to be able to make money off the bods anymore.  It's only, it happens to all strippers.  What the F are these girls going to do?  Please, someone tell me.  They're certainly not going to drive over to IBM and put in an application as a programmer.

Common sense and brains and responsibility and whatever else it needed to push a button.  Then all these girls put together.  Are we back to the shaving the ass thing?  We're not back to that.  Oh, yes.  You're paying them to shut up when you go to the clubs. 
[02:43:30]  Here's a buck.  Shut up.  Shut the F up.  Why do you think some of the guys, like, give a five?  Here it is.  No, I don't even want to hear a word out of you.  Breathe through your nose.

I go for the one minute.  There's a lot of them on.  No wonder whenever they find a dead stripper, they've got their mouth duct tape shut.  No, what?  What?  I'm just saying, it opens up a whole new outlook.  Ross wants to know if this is the Slotesburg Town Council.  What are their meetings?

[02:53:30]  It's coming today.  I knew it.  I can't take it.  You never showed that they're just going to come.  Bar.  Bar.  All right.  Bar.  We're almost done.  Vaginas.  We're almost done.  Vaginas.  We're almost done.  Butt sex.  What a mess.  You know, I think this was the most entertaining show we've done.  Almost really.  It was just so. 
[02:54:00]  I'm reading the instant feedbacks.  I can't count the amount of people that were so happy to hear that Van Halen song kick in.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fags.  1027 WNEW.  What a day we're having, huh?  Ah.  Everybody wants us to turn up the pot again, Anthony. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, my God.  No, Matt from White Plane says, please stop.  I don't have any heroin left.  He's like freaking out.  Another guy says, when are you going to drip the wax?  I want you to drip wax on their filthiest of holes.  And then he says their mouths.  What?  Oh.  We don't have filthy.  Who turned the goddamn speakers up?  Hey, can you ladies hear us out there?  Hey, girls, you hear us?  Hey, ladies.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Ladies.  No, now they shut it off. 
[02:55:00]  Turn on the monitor.  Who turned it up in the first place?  Who?  No, Stinky.  If Stinky turned it up, we will smack him in the face.  Turn up the monitor.  He loses 80,000 points.  Why?  Are they credible?  No, you ladies can come in here.  Come on in.  Come in, ladies.  Yeah.  Hey, look who's in the studio, by the way.  Yeah.  Mike Torrey.  Yep.  Joe Son.  Is your father proud of you today? 
[02:55:30]  I'm not saying a word.  Dude, did you hold the championship ring?  Yeah, I held the Yankee championship ring.  World Series ring.  Even though I'm a Met fan, Mike, but I hope you didn't mind that I got to check out your  ring there.  Not at all.  All right.  Hi, ladies.  Sorry to make you wait so long.  How you doing?  Hey, Kevin, move out of the way, because that mic doesn't work.  Sorry to make you wait.  We were waiting for the Skyrider guy.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  What were you guys doing up there in the...  We were playing X-Rated...  X-Rated Trivia.  Was it fun?  Yeah, I did.  Oh, but you forgot the best.  Who won?  Who was like the best?  I won.  You won?  I got the most...  Oh, really?  Thank you.  No, I don't.  All right, you guys got to talk...  All right, you got to talk in a microphone.  Wow, your nips are pierced.  Can I see that?  That was easy.  What is that?  What is that? 
[02:56:30]  They're stuck.  No, is that...  We don't like to talk about that.  What, you got a tattoo?  Yeah.  Well, what's the matter?  What's wrong?  I don't like to talk about it.  Old boyfriend?  We won't talk...  Uh-oh.  It's okay.  You know why it's okay?  Because no one knows, first of all, who you are, what the tat is, and we won't...  It's being removed.  We won't say it.  Let's just take a look.  It's nothing.  Well, let's see.  You can't make it out.  We got to see.  We got to see.  All right, wait, something's in the way. 
[02:57:00]  Let's look at the Shazam logo.  Shazam, yeah.  That is interesting.  I have no clue what that was supposed to be.  I can't even...  What is it?  It looks like a dagger.  Guaranteed it was...  You were about...  You were about five or six fingers into the Jack Daniels bottle when you got that one,  right?  You had a bit.  You had a bit.  Do you guys want to get hot wax?  I do.  Yes.  All right.  Yeah?  It looked like the guy was cleaning his ink gun.  What is that? 
[02:57:30]  She's never had a gun before.  You've never had the hot wax ripped on you before?  No.  I'm looking forward to it, though.  Yeah.  Are you?  Yeah.  That's pretty fun.  What, you ladies want to get naked?  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, we're kind of running out of time here quickly.  We're going to have to do this really fast, so we can't...  We have to dispose of the foreplay and just say, get the goddamn clothes off at this point.  If Joe Torre's listening, your son left the studio.  Yeah.  He's not here.  He left a long time ago.  Yes, he did, man. 
[02:58:00]  Look how professional he looks and stuff.  He's the suit and everything.  Goddamn that Yankee organization.  He's still great.  Anthony, he left.  He left when he was in here.  You know?  The suit, the nice tailored suit, the tie.  We're like slobs.  You've got to love the Yankee organization, man.  Are you guys getting an ancient world?  Oh, wait.  You?  You look good.  All the blue parts out there?  All right.  That's where we wrap the bodies up.  That's where we stand up the head of a speed shot. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, look at that.  She's got little wows all over it, Opie.  That's cute.  Wow.  Not bad.  All right.  All of a sudden, the things are getting as bad as you are.  All of a sudden, it's not as bad as you are.  Wow.  When the new...  Us guys are hysterical.  I figured that this would be an official wow-ing.  Yeah, this is an official wow-ing, Trish.  Oh, God.  It's not as annoying as it was.  Oh, my God.  She's got a lot better. 
[02:59:00]  I'm not as angry as I was.  I still need a light.  Yeah?  All right.  Once you ladies get really naked outside, you get completely naked, get on the tarp.  We'll be out there with a couple of mics.  Yeah, roll around a little bit.  Get all warmed up, okay?  There we go, the lovely ladies.  Just, man, yeah.  Try to keep that, what is that, that, oh, talking stuff to a minimum.  Yeah, please.  Don't talk.  Isn't it funny how all of a sudden things melted away? 
[02:59:30]  It wasn't a fan anymore when they were taking your clothes off?  My headache went away.  I just totally forgot about, like, 80 of the things that were annoying me just minutes earlier.  Cool.  Wow.  All right.  Do we have a mic out there?  All right.  We're ready to go.  We're just going to plug them in, because we're ready to go out there.  Well, we can do a quick round of what did we learn as we head out to pour hot wax a little  over.  Yeah.  Tell you, is that the kind of stuff you've got to content with on a daily basis? 
[03:00:00]  What's up?  Oh, God.  This is awesome.  I'm ashamed on behalf of all women.  You are ashamed?  I'm so ashamed.  Yeah.  This is terrible.  Yeah.  I learned that there's a McGlossin group for whores.  McGlossin group.  And I also learned that he'll talk to me in the over room.  In the over room, right.  Yeah, the over room.  And don't forget, what does every dermatologist say?  Masturbate during cramps.  Masturbate during cramps.  Oh, yeah.  Ask any dermatologist. 
[03:00:30]  It relieves the pain of T.M.  And then...  I have an idea, you guys.  Well, first you've got to go to your gynecologist to get some strides.  I have an idea.  Yeah.  Can we hot wax our lips so we'll stop the hell out?  Well, wax and lips, that's the show.  Thank you, pal.  All right.  Let's go, guys.  Bye.  Blind Dave, what's up, man?  That's getting old.  Just say what's up.  Poor blind Dave.  Think of this guy's life. 
[03:01:00]  He'd go to see strippers.  You can't see him, but he can hear him.  I'd rather be deaf Dave.  Well, today, I would have rather been deaf Dave.  Deaf Dave.  I learned strippers can have the brain.  God wished upon a flea.  And if I could have found a window, I would have jumped out of it.  Okay?  Over and out of time, it does.  All right.  Thank you, pal.  All right.  Mike, you're next on A&W.  How are you?  Guys, what's up?  I have a suggestion. 
[03:01:30]  Make sure when you wax them that you have enough wax all over their body  to encase them like Han Solo, and he had to strike back.  Make him look like that with the same face, like all canes in it.  If you do that, it's not a physical man go in there and slap the crap out of you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Are they ready?  They're not naked.  I've never seen a group of people so angry with strippers before in my life.  You're not naked.  Get naked. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, thank you.  Doug, what's going on?  We'll lose the panties out here, Rick Yell.  Doug, what's going on?  Guys, how are you?  Good.  You convinced me that strippers are an argument for abortion.  Oh, my God.  Next time I go, I'm going to put on the dollar bills.  Stay in school.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Later, bud.  Bye.  Let's go to John real fast.  John, you're next on A&W.  Johnny.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned that being your dumb guy also burns more calories than playing golf. 
[03:02:30]  True, man.  He was sweating pretty good back there.  Sweet dream, precious.  Next time I go to the strip club with everyone, I will put in one of those matchbooks where it says  draw a binky so maybe they can get an archery or something going because it's draw the turtle.  Draw a binky.  Tommy, turn your radio down, Tommy.  Hey.  Turn that radio down there, pal.  No, I got no radio on.  What do you got?  You got your own slut in there. 
[03:03:00]  Listen to me.  You guys listen to me?  Yeah.  I spend $8,000 on a...  Listen.  I spend $8,000 a week on strippers and I want a refund.  You hear me?  We hear you, Tyler.  Listen to me.  You ruined the entire fantasy.  All right.  Thank you.  I want precious.  All right.  Bye.  Well, can we go out there?  I guess we got mics set up and everything.  Oh, my God.  My IQ is dropping faster than the NASDAQ.  Too bad Joe Torrey's son is going to miss this. 
[03:03:30]  He picked the wrong time to leave the show.  All right.  Here we are out in Sodom and Gomorrah land.  All right.  The blue top.  Well, that's a very little blue top.  That's like a mini blue top.  It's a little picnic thing that you spread out over there.  Very good.  Jesus Christ, Elton.  All the girls are naked.  How lovely.  She's not naked.  She's got to take her clothes off. 
[03:04:00]  What were you saying?  Oh, they're all yelling at each other for not being totally naked.  She has to take her clothes off.  She's got her clothes on.  We're all naked.  That's not fair.  Take your clothes off.  Yeah.  Remember when we used to be all sensitive?  You need a light?  I got your light.  Here you go.  There you go.  American Molotov cocktail.  That's a lot of it.  It's your light.  All right.  So we need like two ladies to drip the wax and two ladies to receive the wax.  Shannon, the hot Shannon. 
[03:04:30]  God, this has been ruined.  All right.  We got to.  We got to.  She's got to.  She's never had it done before.  Rain never had that wax done before.  That's all right.  Okay.  Mike, who's got the feel of Mike?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  My lady is mine.  We're setting up the spaz cam.  We're setting up the spaz cam.  Are we getting these little pictures of the ladies?  Okay.  Nice.  Two girls laying on the tarp, okay? 
[03:05:00]  Whoa.  You didn't like, you didn't mow the lawn before you got here.  No.  You got Fred.  Wow.  You got Fred Flintstone fish.  Fred Flintstone mouth.  Fred Flintstone mouth.  Oh, you were going to say it on the air?  All right.  So, the lovely Shannon.  What's your name? 
[03:05:30]  Tattoo girl?  CJ.  CJ, okay.  Yeah, you can start tripping.  Oh, that's true.  Up, up, up high.  Don't worry.  Here we go.  It did hurt.  It's what I got to do.  Oh.  See?  And look how high she is.  That hurts.  Ow.  What?  What amateurs?  This is the most fun I had in the world.  You going for my kiki? 
[03:06:00]  Yes, I am.  Oh.  You don't feel like me.  She's going for the kiki over here.  She has no penis to me.  Oh, that hurts.  Aim for it.  Yeah, start tripping.  Oh.  Don't you girls know how to make a candle grip?  Oh.  It doesn't hurt.  I never lose.  Anymore.  Oh, wait.  It's too hot.  Pilot the bombardier.  Give me a little.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that kind of feels good. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, you like that?  Yes, I do.  Oh, there you go.  She can't get the wax.  Mine's tipping out.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that was the nipple.  Wow, she's dripping it all over her.  Oh, darn, baby.  Oh, the blow of that.  Shit, it doesn't feel bad.  It's pretty silly, guys.  It doesn't feel bad.  I think I like that.  Turn over.  Oh, that sounds...  Oh, yeah.  I'm not burning my ass. 
[03:07:00]  No, it's too scary to me.  Flip over.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Flip over.  Flip over.  Let's go for the...  Hey, does someone have bed pets in this room?  I have bed.  You're not burning my thing.  Wait.  Ow, ow.  That hurts.  No, that hurts.  I knew that.  You did it.  Oh, shit.  Go, baby.  Oh, ow. 
[03:07:30]  You know what?  No, it's yours.  What is that?  Oh, yeah.  You got my balloon nuts stuck together.  What, my knot?  Yeah.  Right in there.  Oh, my God.  Anyone have a hatchet?  I'm not going to say it this time.  Okay, here we go.  Shannon, you're closing my knot.  All right, get both candles dripping on the fine...  Yeah, a gang candling.  Lady. 
[03:08:00]  Jeez, man.  Whoa, she's like...  She's grabbing at the cards and everything.  Oh, she's being hammered.  I see a dermatologist.  Oh, easy.  Oh, easy.  Oh, easy.  Oh, easy.  Oh, Wang.  Oh, well.  Oh, woo.  Oh, woo-woo.  Oh, woo-woo.  Oh, my.  I love the oil.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:08:30]  How does that feel?  Oh, Wang.  My balloon nuts stuck together.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Oh.  Wow.  Bullseye.  That's pretty good.  Total bullseye.  How do you get this off?  I like it.  Well, I'm sure I'm...  How do you get this thing off?  Girls, hold on.  Well, hold on.  All right, hold on.  Feel my...  Wait, a little bit higher.  They move again. 
[03:09:00]  Wow.  All right.  They're all happening.  Oh, I feel that.  Yeah?  Now the girls are switching positions.  The girls are getting maxed.  Now the skin in the house.  A little bit higher, Al.  Oh, you got to go higher.  Oh, my God.  It looks like Edward G.  That burns me up.  Madam, see?  Oh, Trish.  Higher, higher, higher. 
[03:09:30]  That is skin, you know.  It is skin.  I feel like that.  That's when we're burning.  Okay.  Let's go back to the gear.  I need a guest now.  Let's get back inside.  Please.  Okay.  This isn't fun anymore.  I can tell you.  I'm completely just, like, turned off at this point.  I think, uh, I think I'm going to go gay.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  I'm looking for a guy.  What was that?  What was that aroma?  But there's something about the aroma I recognize.  That's dog food, Brandon.  Thomas, Mr. Lawson, you've got to try this.  All right.  Tell the ladies to continue, because people are watching on the sky's camp.  Yeah, just tell them to keep going.  Chris, what's going on?  How are you, Chris?  We only have a few minutes left here.  Well, I learned why they're throwing music so loud at the strip club. 
[03:10:30]  Bravo.  Very good, man.  Education.com, guys.  All right.  Oh, do you hear them in there?  Is there a mic in there that we can go to at any point?  Yeah, I think so.  Uh, Timmy.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, Timmy.  I learned there's going to be a new kind of special ethic.  Super trivia.  Very good, man.  Hey, it's good syndication.  I hear you fine.  All right, Francis. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  All right.  Hey, Timmy.  Oh, it's so cool.  How are you?  Good.  Uh, I learned that, uh, I've been seeing your own doctor all this time.  Yeah, I must have been seeing a dermatologist instead.  Good dermatologist.  I know.  Uh, tell the ladies, thank you very much.  All right, thank you.  You might make it.  All right.  A lot of people checking in, I'll be saying that the reason the pilot didn't show up today  is he heard the strippers and flew his plane into a building.  Oh.  Uh, Pauly, what's going on? 
[03:11:30]  Hey, what's up, Francis?  How are you, Pauly?  Yeah, I, uh, I finally learned why Earl had so much trouble getting to all the wild places.  Huh?  The, uh, sperm, uh, causes brain damage.  Oh, Jesus.  Man.  All right.  Thank you, Pauly.  My syndication when a stripper gets his TV.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's go to AJ.  AJ, what did you learn on the show today?  What I learned today was that Pike, Pauly, is the invisible man.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, I think you're right.  My syndication yesterday.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye, buddy.  No, if Joe's listening, uh, your son left a long time ago.  Yeah.  I believe he left right after that intelligent break about Giuliani and his impending separation.  Right.  He's correct, right?  All for now.  Why don't he and Anthony?  This is all for them.  All for them, please, take it back.  No, no, no.  Anybody else? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, ladies, you're still on.  Do you like my kiki?  Yes, I love my kiki.  All right, who's going to give the plugs for the fine ladies that entertained us today?  I know I have laughs in my hands.  Oh, kiki?  Yeah, you can have your kiki go to Wacky Key while you're on.  Yeah, Wacky Key.  Well, when they're not dancing, they are performing brain surgery over at Cedar Mount Sinai.  Have a great body slam her ass.  All right, listen, we've got to get the plugs out of the way.  We've got to get the hell out of here. 
[03:13:00]  Kiki is working for NASA.  Ed, what's going on?  Hey, Ellen, hey, what's up?  You learned something today?  Yeah, I learned that a penis a day makes your brain go away.  What a penis a day.  Hey, you're okay.  All right, Ed, thank you.  Well, me and my brother are just dying in the car right now.  Oh, cool, man.  I hung up on that back.  I'm sorry.  Get the naked ladies in here.  Let them get their plugs in, because we've got to get off the air.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  The invisible man is leaving the studio.  See you soon.  Live it now, live it now, come on, come on.  Live it now, live it now, come on, come on, come on.  All right.  Are the ladies coming in for their plugs?  We've got to get off the air.  Yeah, let's get them their plugs.  Come on, you waxy brain, Sarah.  Jen, get them on that mic, one at a time.  Give your plug.  Ah, the lovely ladies.  Yeah, here they come. 
[03:14:00]  Here, get on that mic and give the plug.  Hi, I'm Rainey.  If you want to see us, you've got to call Missy Haven at 516-797-000.  You, you, you, you're next.  Hi, this is CJ.  I work with Rainey at Missy Haven.  You can see us down there.  Are you guys dancing tonight?  Ah, no.  No?  Okay.  On the weekends. 
[03:14:30]  Usually on the weekends.  All right.  You do bachelor parties and stuff.  All right.  Shannon, you want to give a plug?  Shannon, the kiki girl.  And you can see me at hotshannon.com.  Hotshannon.com.  There you go.  And, of course, last but not least, the lovely Trish.  Well, maybe one of the girls can help you out. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, let me see that.  Let me see.  I made an improvement.  All right.  You got a plug.  I'm just messing with you.  Get on that mic.  Get on that mic.  Look at that wild baby city.  That's beautiful.  Yes, of course.  And, actually, the girls are like, let's make some more of them.  We'll put them all over the beach.  Really?  That would be cool.  Yeah, we got a wild baby city.  We got a wild baby city.  You kids aren't snacking on the bane ships out there, are you?  No.  No?  Okay.  I'm just wondering.  Oh, good. 
[03:15:30]  The candy ones.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  All right.  So, do you have a plug, Trish?  Actually, I'm going to be coming out on the calendar for next year, and I'm waiting for  the posters.  Right on.  Cool.  We look forward to your next weekend.  I want to thank you guys.  See you next weekend.  All right.  Sorry you made you wait so long.  I don't mind.  You have some very important things you have.  I'm just happy to call my round.  I'm looking forward to get all the rounds out there.  All right.  Cool.  Very good.  Education underground.  Yeah.  There she goes.  Look at that.  Education underground.  Yeah. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Mom, I'm coming home.  I'm moving back in with Mom because I can't handle it anymore.  You know something?  I think I need to look into my personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I'm seriously considering that.  I think I have been away from Christ the Lord for too long.  Yeah.  And I think it's time that I come home to Jesus. 
[03:16:30]  So, Opie, it's over.  Goodbye.  I'm going to go on some religious programs.  All right.  You guys, thanks for making us laugh today.  Half the stuff we couldn't even read on the instant feedback.  We're cracking up.  Don't think it's going to waste when you send an instant feedback in.  You have a penis during commercial.  This coming out in next month's Reader's Guide to I Am Jack's Limp Schlong.  Eric, I think you're the last call today.  What's going on? 
[03:17:00]  Eric?  Eric?  Oh, he's listening to his radio.  Eric, you're on?  Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.  Eric!  One of these calls, man.  Let it out, let it out, let it out, come on.  Buddy?  Oh, boy.  Buddy?  Eric, are you a stripper?  Yeah.  Eric?  Yeah.  Well, you're stupid.  You're the last call today.  What do you got?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Precious, I'd rather see your grandmother naked, your dead grandmother naked than watch 
[03:17:30]  you strip and strip.  I'm about to cross to Robert Moses' Causeway Brits, and I think I'm going to make a right  hand turn.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Let's get that out of here.  Okay, brother.  I have cameras offline.  That's it.  All right.  Well, we had fun today.  Once again, accomplishing absolutely nothing on this fine radio show of ours.  I think we were counterproductive today.  Yeah, I think so.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, too.  Stay there.  Gentlemen.  Doug, you're wacky. 
[03:18:00]  Are you masking me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Or just make me hang on.  Anthony Fidelity Diamond.  Yes, yes.  Are you thinking of getting engaged?  Maybe you found the right girl.  One that can speak in complete sentences.  One that can carry on a conversation with you.  You're compelled with.  You know, after today's show, Anthony, I think I'm going to reconsider it.  I think I'm going to at least put it in the realm of possibilities once again. 
[03:18:30]  Hopi, what's more intelligent than a strike?  A diamond from Fidelity Diamond.  A diamond from Fidelity Diamond is light.  A stripper.  Yes.  It sits there.  Great.  He doesn't have a brain in it.  It's the best vibe.  You don't know anything about diamonds, do you?  Well, no, but you know what, after listening to the stripper for the last two hours? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  The truth of it is, I'm getting one of those fake ones.  They're not going to know the difference.  Well, if you're going to marry a stripper, that might not be the case.  But if you're marrying that sweet girl, the girl you're in love with, you want to give her the best.  That has the brain, and that will know the difference between the face and the world.  Right, sure.  They educate you.  Put it this way.  They're so good at educating you about diamonds.  I bet we could send one of these strippers down to Tom Coliseum. 
[03:19:30]  And he will educate them to the point where they can come down here and give you an intelligent discussion about diamonds.  I bet you.  Don't push it.  All right.  Well, people of normal intelligence.  Don't push it, because I've seen monkeys with more intelligence.  You should see what I've seen through the door.  Chris is just bending over, showing like her Kiki.  Kiki?  They're taking the mask out of her Kiki.  That's okay.  They're like looking at the monkeys when they start throwing pieces at each other. 
[03:20:00]  They're just like, there's nothing going on out there.  Sorry.  Well, they educate you, Moppy, about your diamonds.  One of the most important purchases or problem-making in your life.
