<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion of a graphic video posted on opiananthony.com showing a man's scrotum trapped in a mousetrap.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony,  commented on its viral potential and their multi-media approach, mentioning guest Gavin's obsession with show regulars "Big A" and Twitchells.  They contrasted their work ethic with Howard Stern's, accusing Stern of laziness and re-using old material. Opie also promoted his brother Brett's restaurant opening, FH Riley's.  A humorous exchange with guest Patrice O'Neal followed,  sparked by Opie's admission of lacking Black friends. Patrice recounted a successful Philadelphia stand-up performance, with caller descriptions of the audience's reaction.  Numerous listener calls, many centered around the scrotum-mousetrap video, ensued. The show previewed the "American Mess" segment and played the audio of the scrotum-mousetrap incident before concluding.  A caller, Chris from Jersey, even announced his intention to trap his foreskin in a mousetrap.

The next segment heavily featured listener calls detailing reactions to the scrotum-mousetrap video and another video of a man receiving oral sex from a hooker with a strap-on on an airplane.  The hosts engaged in vulgar exchanges, frequently mocking "Osis." A caller challenged another to a "ball bag challenge" involving various traps.  The segment introduced "Neo," a caller with Morquio syndrome, whose medical records were read on air, detailing his physical deformities. Neo's medical condition and appearance served as comedic fodder.  His listener-submitted karaoke performance was played, followed by listener-created remixes of sexually suggestive Howard Stern audio clips featuring Howard, Allison Stern, and Emily Stern.  "Big A" and "Twitchells" delivered a comedically inept and offensive news report, with the hosts adding cruel commentary.  The segment ended with continued discussion of Neoâ€™s physical state and more listener calls.

The following segment opened with jokes about oral sex, followed by a faux Maury Povich call. A caller, Jeff, described a friend who drives with his feet and exposes his genitals while drinking.  Calls followed from a WWW.SHOP.COM representative offering Neo merchandise and from Neo himself, who discussed his PalTalk activities, moral objections to prostitution, and "pal crack" use. A bizarre call from a man offering his semen to Neo's mother provoked angry reactions.  The segment focused heavily on Neo's physical appearance and health issues, including scars, heart murmurs, and an enlarged heart. Neo displayed himself on camera.  The conversation turned to Stalker Patty's stunt of crawling naked and blindfolded across a mousetrap-covered floor, with a promised audio clip.  The ethics of such stunts were debated, referencing a New York Daily News article.  Various listener calls and a lengthy interview with comedian Rich Vos, discussing his comedy experiences, followed.  The segment concluded with the introduction of Kevin, a listener with epidermal nevus syndrome, scoliosis, partial deafness, and a glass eye. Kevin discussed his medical history, removing his glass eye on air at the hosts' urging.  The hosts nicknamed him "Backface Boy" and "Bizarro Opie."

The final segment featured the "American Mess" segment, focusing on Kevin ("Scoliope") with crude jokes about his scoliosis, virginity, and dating life. His medical history, including a childhood kidney operation, was discussed graphically.  "Big A" and Louis Twitchells delivered another inept and offensive news report covering the Super Bowl, Tijuana drug tunnels, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Oprah's apology to James Frey.  No Filter Paul, known for sweating profusely on one side of his face, appeared and ate a spicy pizza. The hosts announced LA trips for Kevin and Neo, concluding with further humorous banter.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  God damn it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You can act like a man. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're just a tool.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's all.  How many Dago, Guinea, Walk, Grease, Ball, Kool-Bars come out of the woodwork?  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:05:30]  You need to shut the fuck up.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  Hey, good morning.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  XM Satellite Radio is the place you're at, I guess.  And this is the only virus spreading across America.  It certainly is.  If you like what you hear, tell a friend.  That's how the virus spreads.  Do that right off the bat. 
[00:06:00]  The video, the mousetrap scrotum thing is up on opiananthony.com from yesterday.  Yes, we gave it a screening this morning in the office.  Steve said he put up his version of the video because we had a webcam video.  Yeah.  But Steve had crystal clear video that he took.  Yep.  He threw that up there around 11 o'clock last night.  Already like 5,000 to 6,000 people have checked out the video.  Yeah, it's going to be one of those clips that make it around the web, I think.  Yeah, how many people have seen a guy take his ball bag and flop it into a mousetrap? 
[00:06:30]  Not many.  Not many at all.  That's what the Internet's about.  That's why it was invented.  So we can see from the comfort of our own homes, a gentleman snap his ball bag in a mousetrap.  And that's where you can help us.  You take that video or you email a friend, maybe, that doesn't know what opiananthony's about.  Doesn't even know what satellite radio's about.  And you send him that clip and go, this is what it's about, my friend.  That's what it's about.  Get down to Best Buy and Circuit City and get your fine XM satellite radio. 
[00:07:00]  And that's part of it, isn't it?  It's just part of it.  This whole show is getting very multimedia.  Very involved.  The listeners are involved.  You can watch things as they happen.  And then later on you get the crystal clear digital video of what happened.  It's amazing.  With an extreme close-up.  There are so many important things that need to be videotaped.  You ever look at surveillance tape of a crime and you're like, can you identify this guy? 
[00:07:30]  And it looks like this ghostly blur and it could be anybody.  Like, that's where you need a crystal clear sharp camera.  Right.  Why did we need one to see a guy's ball bag snapped in a mousetrap?  I don't know.  But we had it and it's available and you can see it.  You know what was funny about that?  The priority is a little skewed here.  Yeah, the version we had early, because we wanted to get something up on the website immediately,  was, you know, your webcam from Pal Talk.  So like you said, it was grainy and the shot was kind of like a medium shot. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And it was still deeply disturbing.  Yes, it was.  So then I get in here this morning.  I saw the video of Steve's version, you know, this morning for the first time.  Mm-hmm.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  The screen is nothing but ball bag.  Just zoomed in on ball bag.  In all its awful detail.  Never a good close-up on a ball bag.  Never.  And it just makes the video even that much more horrific.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  So you can download it for yourself on opianthony.com and send it to a friend.  That should be one of those cute emails you send to everybody.  Yeah.  You know, check this out.  I rarely listen to our program on the way in, in the morning.  I listen to the replay later in the afternoon, catch some stuff.  We were having a good time.  This morning I'm driving in and it was right at that part where he was doing the ball bag  and the mousetrap and I had to listen.  I had to listen. 
[00:09:00]  It's one of those train wreck, car wreck things where as an innocent bystander you have to stop  and look and go, oh my God, what has happened there?  Had to listen.  Well, we're going to play the audio a little later for the people that missed it.  Yeah.  Because we're getting a lot of email.  Because they're hearing about it.  Yeah.  Every once in a while we do one of these things where it just, it just, everyone just starts  talking about it and telling their friends and you feel the buzz.  Yeah.  You feel the buzz in the radio world.  The buzz. 
[00:09:30]  So we'll play that a little later on in the program.  I don't know what's going on today.  You talk about how the show is growing.  Yeah.  There's more and more people just hanging out around here.  It's becoming like a clubhouse.  Like we don't have Patrice O'Neill yet, but we have his friend Gavin.  Gavin just stopped by because whenever he hears that Twitchells is going to be around or  Big A, he has to be here.  He's obsessed with Big A and Twitchells.  Who isn't?  Who isn't?  So they're both coming in to do the news and do their thing.  Freakish.  And Gavin is just a big fucking sick motherfucker. 
[00:10:00]  Gee, you.  Yeah.  Where are you from exactly?  It's Birmingham.  It's actually the center of the world, my friend.  Yeah.  Yeah, the center of the world.  Doesn't he look like one of those old school boxers where they don't wear gloves or anything?  No gloves.  He looks like one of those no-closed spots.  Just bare-fisted boxing in some warehouse somewhere where a bunch of people around putting their bets down.  And I picture you as the guy that lets the other guy have the first punch.  And you can see him wipe off a little blood off his living and go, all right, mate, now it's my turn. 
[00:10:30]  Some gypsy size.  Yeah, just not even fazed by the first punch.  And then just one band that got down with your meat fist.  Well, you hit him with everything you got, and for a split second you think he did damage.  Yeah.  And you're waiting, waiting, waiting, and then he gives you that smile.  And you're like, oh, smile.  Now it's time for you to get your ass kicked.  Birmingham style.  Birmingham style, which is the old school, like the put them off, put them off. 
[00:11:00]  What was that?  Cambridge rules, I think it is.  What was it?  The marquee?  The marquees of Queensbury.  Queensbury rules.  Queensbury rules.  Fight like gentlemen, sir.  You got to do this stance like a little fighting Irish guy.  What punch can you do from that angle?  It's all about the uppercut.  That's as it is.  It's called the uppercut.  Why I exclusively do the uppercut?  The uppercut, don't you know?  Grand, grand. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we have American mess going on today.  Hopefully.  We don't know.  What's that panning out?  We don't know.  I see a lot of people out there.  I don't know how many messes we got.  Although I'm looking at a guy right now that has very tiny legs, so I don't know if he's  part of the program or what.  I don't know, man.  Holy crap.  What's wrong with that guy?  Yeah, he's here.  That might be one of the pal cam regs.  Fucking awful.  Regulars.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What's his deal?  If it is, it's Neo?  I don't know.  Yeah, I think they're all saying it's Neo. 
[00:12:00]  And what's his deal?  I have no idea.  I see him on camera.  Yeah.  He's in a lot of the rooms every night.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah.  He stalks the show.  You see him sometimes.  He's in a wheelchair.  Sometimes he's getting up walking.  I don't know what his story is.  Oh.  E-Rock is making a crazy face.  He just made the ooh face.  E-Rock, what's that guy all about?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  A little briefing.  And he's partially deaf, so you have to yell at him to hear it.  Oh, God.  You know what the best thing about it was? 
[00:12:30]  When I was walking in here, he was trying to get in a lift, and the guy downstairs was  like, you can't go up till seven o'clock.  Yeah.  He just carried on, got in a lift, and was standing in a lift for, like, 15 minutes.  Don't you love the English?  They've got a different word for everything.  Oh, it's our, the our words.  Things are going up and down.  I don't know.  I saw him come out of a lorry, and then he got in the lift.  Sorry, the elevator.  Let me change the language for Americans.  The elevator.  Well, I think we figured that one out.  We're starting American Mess today, and I think we're going to do an open call every 
[00:13:00]  Friday until we are satisfied with the discoveries.  Yeah, it's, I think it's one of those things that'll build.  It's like American Idol.  It's not over in one, one night.  No.  No, they stretched that shit out.  Well, we'll see, we'll see what shows up today, but then our, I think after we find  enough messes, they're going to have to compete in some fashion to distinguish themselves from  the other messes.  You know what?  It's going to force us to do.  Write something?  Yeah, well, no, we'll never write again. 
[00:13:30]  Work, prep.  Fuck the writing crap.  That never got us anywhere.  The old days.  Hey, we'll spend four hours on a two-minute bit that will play three times on the show.  Fuck that.  Isn't that great?  Turn the mics on and go.  I got a great idea.  Why don't we record, re-record some of the old bits that we can't get from the old company?  Yeah, just in case you're wondering what Howard's doing, don't you worry.  We're monitoring him closely so you don't have to, actually. 
[00:14:00]  The pests are on it.  What a lazy fuck.  He's decided to take his, he couldn't take his bits from his old place.  Yeah.  We couldn't take our bits from our old place.  So he's decided to just re-record them and re-act them out and stuff.  Shit from like the 80s some of this stuff was.  And then the early 90s.  Instead of trying to come up with new stuff, with this new medium, he's going back and  remembering some of the stuff that worked on commercial radio that he couldn't bring  with him.  And he's going to just re-do them and re-act them out. 
[00:14:30]  And re-recorded bits and song parodies.  Things that Jackie was on that all of a sudden now Jackie isn't on.  I mean, that's laziness.  That's half a billion dollars and you go in and re-record old stuff.  So trust me, you're not missing anything.  Where's the revolution that was supposed to take place?  Where's this pioneering spirit of satellite radio?  And I'm so glad more people are on to him and how lazy he is and how he's lost his passion. 
[00:15:00]  You pointed out, Anthony, Rolling Stone just killed him in an article.  Well, Rolling Stone, who has, I think, always kissed his ass over the years, a scathing  article came out and just bashes him.  And it's not even like, oh, wow, they're bashing him and there's no reason for it.  Every point they made was valid.  This is just somebody pointing out what he's doing over there or the lack thereof and how 
[00:15:30]  now it's just a bunch of people.  There's no one there.  There's no enemy for him to rail against.  So it's just a bunch of people over there kissing his ass.  And it doesn't make for a good radio.  Really a very entertaining article.  So what does he do?  He turns around and says, Rolling Stone is out of touch.  And selling out.  I don't get it.  Hey, God bless him.  Yeah, what the hell?  You know, for a half a billion dollars, I'd be hard pressed to say what I would do or  wouldn't do for that much money. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  There's a lot of it.  Whenever you're sitting around with your buddies and stuff and the question always would come  up, you know, what would you do for a million dollars?  I think there's worse things than recording old bits.  Right.  And, you know, doing boring radio.  You know, it usually ended up with sucking cock or something like that.  Doing the fat bird.  And there was always a friend that you could talk in and saying, all right, yeah, I would.  Fuck it.  Bag it.  Bag it.  Bag it. 
[00:16:30]  If you would do it for a million dollars, you'd do it for a dollar.  Where's the cutoff point?  Like what?  Like $999,999 would you do it for?  Oh, what?  That extra buck?  Are you going to suck a cock?  That's so gross.  That's the worst.  It's just things you learned growing up with your friends that you never fest to.  You never say you would, even in a completely hypothetical situation.  I'll say this.  If we're lucky enough to sign a contract where we're making $100 million a year, if you see  that headline in the newspapers, trust me, it's over, Johnny. 
[00:17:00]  It's over.  We're not even going to try at all.  No, we'll skate to the finish line, too.  Yeah.  At least we'll admit it.  Yeah.  Anyone's paying me $100 million a year to do this shit, I ain't working hard.  We're just going to skate.  Of course, that's what you do at that point.  Mark of Long Island, what's up?  Hey, brother.  I was driving by the restaurant yesterday.  What's the ETA?  My brother's restaurant?  Yeah.  I got another one of my brother's in the studio today.  We got a huge family. 
[00:17:30]  My brother, Brett's restaurant opens today.  Oh.  He's got to deal with politicians in Huntington today.  Oh, no.  My brother has to deal with a ribbon-cutting ceremony.  Are you kidding?  My brother hates that crap.  A ribbon-cutting ceremony?  He actually has to stand in front of his restaurant and cut a ribbon with politicians.  With the big dopey scissors?  Or is it real scissors?  Like, they got the big fake scissors, and that's for the photo?  Yeah.  Hop.  And then they come by with a regular scissor.  My brother's going to be very successful. 
[00:18:00]  He's been doing this restaurant thing for a very long time.  But he hates being in the spotlight.  Like, there's like an article in the Long Islander today with him behind the bar.  Oh, boy.  And he's a lot different than me.  He likes to be low-key, behind the scenes.  Don't pay attention to me.  And now he's in the Long Islander with a picture.  We'd like to welcome everybody to this grand opening.  I'm, well, what's the politician's name? 
[00:18:30]  I'm him.  And we're here at a ribbon-cutting ceremony.  Those are, like, the worst things, and the politician is there.  Or when they, I like when they do the groundbreaking, and they have these chrome shovels, and they  put their hard hats on like they might get hurt, and there's 20 pictures of them with  a little shovel full of dirt.  They scoop a half a shovel of dirt.  And then the big crane comes in.  And you know those.  Like it's a barn raising in an Amish yard. 
[00:19:00]  And you know the real workers are sitting there like, can you get it the fuck out of  the way so we can get to work?  Get this guy.  He's got a friggin' Armani suit on and a shovel.  I'm gonna help.  Yeah.  No, you're not.  Helmet off.  So my brother's got to do the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the restaurant FH Riley's, 400  New York Avenue in Huntington.  And then he has to do, like, an open bar and feed the politicians for an hour and a half.  That's what I call them, fat cats.  He's got to, like, kiss their ass for, like, an hour and a half today.  It's part of the deal. 
[00:19:30]  And then we're opening up to everybody tonight at 6.  I'll be there.  Basically, the bar's gonna be open for drinks.  And I think we're gonna have, like, hors d'oeuvres so you can try some of the food out.  And then the restaurant opens full service on Monday.  Wow.  Are you gonna show up today or tomorrow, Anthony?  I would love to, but...  I was waiting for that.  No, um, tomorrow?  Yeah, he'll be around there tomorrow, too.  I can make it tomorrow.  It should be an exciting weekend at the restaurant.  Yeah, I can make it tomorrow.  Yeah, it sounds like the whole weekend. 
[00:20:00]  It's FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue, Huntington, starting at 430 if you want to see my brother  who's just awkward in the spotlight, cut a ribbon.  I gotta ask.  Yeah.  Does he have Guinness on tap?  Absolutely.  I'm there!  Holy shit, great.  He's not stupid.  Very good.  I'm telling you, he's been at this a long time.  He knows what works and what doesn't.  Because you can't have a bar with that name and not have Guinness on tap.  Yeah, FH Riley's.  400 New York Avenue, starting today, it opens up and a bunch of us will be down there hanging 
[00:20:30]  and drinking.  My brother, Elmo, will probably...  I'll be there doing tequila shots all night.  And so if you want to catch me when I fall, that'll be great.  My brother will be hitting on all the hot listeners today, so...  Just like the MySpace.  Just hot girls only, man.  Live MySpace.  That's right.  Could you be my friend?  Absolutely.  You gotta make my brother your friend.  I know.  Well, I will make an exception.  I tried...  For Black History Month, which is coming up in February, I've put nothing but African-Americans 
[00:21:00]  as my friends on MySpace.  But for some reason, people are pointing out that they're fake black people on my site.  Like, one is a picture of...  What do I have up there?  Mr. T, right?  Mr. T.  And it's obviously not Mr. T. It's some dopey white guy with Mr. T as his picture.  Mr. T. But I've been searching through, and I don't have many actual black people as  my MySpace friends.  Well, I photoshopped myself.  You don't have...  You're not on MySpace, Patrice, right? 
[00:21:30]  No.  See, you'd be up there the whole month of February.  I got over white...  Let's face it, Anthony.  You don't have any black friends on any kind of anything that you ever needed a black  friend for.  You are absolutely right.  I don't.  No genre does he have a black friend.  I'm trying to think back of the last time I had an actual black friend that came over  my house and hung out, and I think it was...  Stop having that memory look, too.  I'm looking at you.  If you're trying to remember the day you were going to get phony in. 
[00:22:00]  No, I did.  I'm a racist looking at a black friend.  I believe it was Smitty Dunbar when I was in Central Islip, Francis J. O'Neill Elementary  School, and that was the last black friend I had.  And that was the guy that taught you the lyrics to Rapper's Delight.  How do you guys say hip hop a hippie?  A hippie hop a hippie?  No, all I remember about Smitty Dunbar was the fact that he would always bum gum off of 
[00:22:30]  me.  Like, he'd come up and everybody...  And it was just everybody.  It was like his gum was a big thing.  It was like cigarettes in high school.  When you were in elementary school, it was gum.  It's like a little prison.  You know, gum was money.  And gum, and if you had a little plastic baggie, and it wasn't weed, it was chocolate for chocolate  milk.  Remember how special you were if you had that?  Oh, remember that?  Yeah, sure.  You'd buy your milk, and then you'd pull out the baggie with the chocolate in it and pour 
[00:23:00]  it in, and people would be like, could I just have the bag?  And the fingers in there and there.  But Smitty would always be like, yo, man, you got a stick?  I was like, all right.  I was afraid he was going to beat me up if I didn't give him one.  So he'd always, like, shake me down for a stick of gum.  But he came over my house.  That was your black friend.  That was my black friend.  He was shaking me down for a stick of Wrigley's every day.  He's a black bully.  Yeah, but he wasn't really a bully. 
[00:23:30]  He was a nice guy about it.  Yeah, I got an announcement.  I'm very close to inviting Patrice O'Neal over to my crib.  Wow.  We're feeling that there might be a blossoming friendship here.  I can't see it.  The other day, I'm leaving the studio, and I'm doing some small talk, and he goes, why  the fuck are you asking that?  And I'm like, dude, I'm trying to be your friend.  It's always awkward trying to make a new friend.  You don't try that.  He's like, hey, man, you all right?  Like, I was in the studio, you all right? 
[00:24:00]  I said, why the fuck are you asking me am I all right?  That's what friends ask other friends, Katrina.  I'm going to just start asking him for his gum.  I'm like, yeah, give me a stick.  I'm like, look, we'll stop making this so awkward.  I'm trying to be your friend.  Don't you get it?  You are really trying.  And I don't do this often, so.  I was trying to help me out a little bit.  Yeah, last time was like Jay from Framingham, and that was seven years ago.  Eight years was the last time I made a new friend.  You're right.  I'm very selective with my friends. 
[00:24:30]  I have not made a new friend.  I can't tell you.  Jay from Framingham.  And you wouldn't be my first black friend, by the way, because Earl's over my place all  the time.  I can't get rid of him.  Earl is a business associate of mine.  But he's the whitest black guy we know.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to bring him in here while you're here, Patrice, because he's the whitest black  guy.  You would be very embarrassed.  And he tries to represent the community, and you can see right through the fucking guy.  Is this nothing there?  Oh, my God.  Is this nothing there?  He wears all black all the time because he wants to be one of these uber black guys. 
[00:25:00]  Like, Earl, who are you kidding?  But that's the pain he's suffering.  He wants to scare people as he's walking down the street.  But the second he opens his mouth, any white person would just be like, oh, okay, I see  where you're at.  Oh, so.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Nothing more painful.  But, see, Gav, we have this thing.  He just does not understand.  Like, the American black thing is so different in England.  It's a different thing.  Yep.  And I tell him he gets this little nip of racism from time to time.  And Gavin is 12,000 feet tall. 
[00:25:30]  He's about all muscle, right?  Oh, yeah.  And when you get that creepy white look, he kind of does the dog looking at himself in  the mirror like, is this, Mike, is this really, do they do this?  It's like, yes, motherfucker.  Yeah, they do.  And there's nothing worse than an American black guy to be that well loved by white people.  It's just, it's just something.  So, even if Earl is not Mr. Tough Guy, he fucking hates to be loved by white, or that  white people have no fear of him whatsoever. 
[00:26:00]  None whatsoever.  No how sad, sorry to interrupt you, no how sad black girl is on MySpace, you know how  you're supposed to have eight friends?  Yeah.  He only has three.  He has Blackula, LeVar Burton, and Booker T. That cannot be real.  Right now.  Is that his real MySpace account?  What's his bio say?  About me.  About me.  There's not much to say about me, really.  That's true.  I'm black, I dress in black clothes every single day, everything in my apartment is black,  that's why they call me Black Earl, O, and I'm black. 
[00:26:30]  That's all he has on his MySpace account.  And he's kind of giving the black power sign in his picture, I like that.  Right.  All right.  Well, so you've got to get my brother on your MySpace account.  I'll make my exception.  Because he's trying to make a lot of friends.  Yeah.  I got like, I think I'm coming up on 11,000, something like that, I'm not sure.  Wow, that's good.  That's a lot, Patrice, if you got on MySpace, I would be willing to share.  What is it?  11,471 friends for everything.  Yeah, 11 and a half grand. 
[00:27:00]  So how many of those people would just be transferred right over to me if I was...  They would be accessible to you.  So would you have like a token white friend, Patrice, on there, would you?  I have a lot of white people.  I know a lot of white people.  It's just that this business has opened up a lot of...  He has no choice.  He has to know white people.  I know a lot of white people.  I really do.  I can't even front, you know what I mean?  But Patrice is, and I've said this in the past, is really an expert on white culture.  Like, you know so much about white people that it scares me.  Like, I'm wondering, where are you getting this inside information from? 
[00:27:30]  NSA.  Hey, I got to say it.  Patrice, very dedicated to this program.  He was at Helium Comedy Club in Philly last night.  We got a car to bring him from Philly to New York just so he could do the radio show,  and then he's going right back to Philly to do Helium all weekend long.  Yep.  And I don't think you're going to say it, so I'm going to say it.  I got a full report on your set last night.  Right, right, right.  Standing ovation when he hit the stage, Anthony.  Nice.  Standing ovation when he left the stage. 
[00:28:00]  The place went nuts for Patrice O'Neal last night in Philly.  Yeah, it was...  Wow.  Absolutely.  They went crazy.  Emotionally draining.  Wow.  To try to tame these sociopaths.  As I'm in the middle of a heart-wrenching story,  it's raining things!  Yeah, welcome.  Welcome.  Yeah, just hold on.  Let me finish how, you know,  my mother was sick with a gallbladder operation when I was five,  and I just wanted to finish talking about that.  Fuck you, Carmo! 
[00:28:30]  Thank you.  Carmo!  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Animal.  Thanks for coming.  They are animals.  They are animals.  I think the pests have accepted Patrice O'Neal into the family.  God almighty.  The report I got, it was insane.  It was insane at the club last night.  Oh, my God, that's great.  Just a sociopath.  And that made me very happy.  This woman girl was, it was cool, it was cool.  Good.  She was, I think she was happy.  She bought some girl that was, like, really into me,  but too scared to see how much she loved me.  Lindsay's friend, Mary Kay.  She's, like, in love with me and shit. 
[00:29:00]  She's completely in love with you.  And she can't be more than five-two.  Just a five-two white girl.  Just a 1960s tragedy.  She was smitten.  She really was.  She only blinked, like, twice while I was talking.  And I just said, you know I'm racist, right?  And this girl, and Lindsay goes, I told her, but she doesn't care.  She doesn't care.  She just was smitten.  And it was, like, oh, this is cute, but it could never work. 
[00:29:30]  Maybe if we moved to France, it'd be acceptable.  France is fucking awful as well.  Yeah.  They're worse in France.  This relationship could only go in Europe, not anywhere else.  No fucking way.  The only thing that would make it worse in France is if she was Jewish.  Or Prisian.  Yeah.  They're not against each other.  I hate this French so much.  She doesn't understand.  Yeah.  Hey, let's say hi to Mike on Long Island.  Mike, what's up?  Boys.  Hey.  What's going on?  Yo, what?  You guys going to be doing any kind of, like, late night thing in the restaurant there? 
[00:30:00]  You got a bar?  You doing music at night or what?  Yeah, we really, my brother jazzed up the bar.  We're going to get a nice bar crowd in there.  And I think Saturday he already hired some blind guy to play.  Awesome.  We're going to do, like, unusual acts in the joint late night.  It should be a good hang for the pest.  Well, I manage a bar over and out to talk it by Stony Brook.  I have a lot, a lot of music.  A lot, a lot of music.  If he needs some references.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  We're going to start out slow.  But today is the ribbon-cutting ceremony with my brother Brett and the big scissors and the politicians and free beer for the politicians. 
[00:30:30]  The big scissors.  Got to suck up to the politicians.  I'm amazed what my life has become.  And then the bar will open up to the pest and everyone else at 6 o'clock tonight.  400 New York Avenue in the middle of Huntington, basically.  F.H. Riley's.  All right.  Well, I'll be down there and check it out.  Cool.  Thanks, Mike.  Peace.  I want a goddamn shot.  I want a goddamn shot.  Because it's socializing.  Oh, no.  Is there any indication?  Is there any indication that certain people might drop down? 
[00:31:00]  Have you heard any rumor, speculation?  What's the word on the street?  I haven't heard anything.  Has the photo been put up with not to be served behind the bar yet?  I'm hoping.  For everyone.  You can go fuck yourself.  Tell your brother and his fucking on-air partner.  And those motherfuckers.  I've been caught in here.  That I've been thrown out of better fucking places.  I'm just going to call you Anthony no more. 
[00:31:30]  Tony.  Could you cash this check for $50,000?  I endorse the back.  Great.  Thanks.  We're going to have a most wanted poster outside.  Oh, my God.  Just steaming hot, man.  Oh, it'll never go away.  It just comes poured out of his gut.  My money's not good enough here, motherfucker. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, you're right.  Anthony's money isn't good enough here.  Unbelievable.  Well, it's American mess today.  Always messing up family portraits.  That's what the banner says behind my brother.  My brother, Elmo.  What's your MySpace account?  Brother Elmo?  Yeah, I think it's Brother Elmo.  I'm new to it, so it's either Elmo or Brother Elmo.  All right, become a friend of my brother's.  Thanks for the plan.  It'll make him happier, and we won't have to deal with his sadness.  I tried to Photoshop myself to be an African American to get on your site. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, really?  People called me a sellout already, so I took that off and put a different picture on.  He'll do whatever it takes to...  I'll pop him on there for sure.  To, you know, talk to hot women.  Yeah, but all I get are the past ragging on me or ragging on the show.  Yeah.  You'll get...  You have to weed through.  You got to weed through that.  Yeah, my brother doesn't understand that.  It's like, you know, he understands that you and I will get hate mail, and it's just part of what we do.  He goes, but why are they sending hate mail to me? 
[00:33:00]  I have nothing to do with the show, really.  Dude, your brother won't answer my hate mail, so I'll send it to you.  Yeah.  It's like...  You're going to get a response.  Yeah, it's like hating Derek Jeter, but you're yelling at, like, the bullpen catcher coach or something.  And I was like, come on, man.  I was like, what the hell?  Leave me alone.  I just designed some t-shirts every once in a while, and I just want to drink a little bit.  Stop already.  If I've waited a long time before I check my email on MySpace, you know, there's 50 pages of messages. 
[00:33:30]  So I kind of...  I piss people off because I'll kind of do a full-page delete every so often.  Like, I go through them, for the most part, all of them, on light days.  And I'll even answer a lot of them.  But some days, it's just like, I'm never going to get through this.  It'll just pile up more so.  We're going with every fifth page gets deleted.  I don't even look at it.  And people are like, dude, you know, fucking Jimmy answers me, and you don't answer.  You know, motherfucker. 
[00:34:00]  No, I delete every so often a few pages.  Do you answer?  Do you answer once a day, or do you, like, have conversations with some, like, you know...  It depends on what the subject is.  A lot of video game questions and answers and shit like that.  I'll do that.  One guy actually wrote, dude, I want to jerk off on your chest.  And I answered, no.  And he actually answered back like he was with the ha-ha-ha.  Holy shit.  I can't believe you even answered me back. 
[00:34:30]  You laugh out loud.  Yeah, shit like that's easy.  Let's go to John in Philly.  Hey, John.  Yeah, hi.  Hey.  I was at Helium.  You were at Helium checking out Patrice O'Neal last night?  Yeah, he fucking killed.  It was hysterical.  That's what I'm hearing.  I don't think I've ever laughed harder in my life.  That's what I'm hearing, man.  Got a great report.  Yeah.  And he'll be there all weekend for the people that haven't seen him yet.  Yeah, I wanted to bring up, I was one of the three people in the very middle that he 
[00:35:00]  was tearing into, my best friend and his girlfriend all night.  I heard you tear it into some white couple or something.  Just the sadness.  You know, you go to Philly, and it's just everybody's dressed like Rocky.  They're still mad at T.O.  You know, it's just sad, but it's angry and sad at the same time.  It's just a bunch of tough guys that'll wring your neck, you know, but at the same time,  the girl goes, shut up, and they just sit there.  And I go, that's just not good. 
[00:35:30]  That's not good.  Did you come out to this music?  Who's fucks, though?  Patrice jogging on stage.  And they're filming Rocky VI, and that's just some type of pride for the city, because  they're just taking right, Rocky winning.  Something.  Dude, he makes a great point, because I spend a lot of time in Philly now.  Most people know, right?  Okay.  And freaking the Rocky thing comes up all the time.  You just drive around.  Well, there's the stairs he ran off. 
[00:36:00]  And here's the, you know, when he was running down the street, and everyone's like, that's  this street.  Is the statue still there, or what?  Yeah, I think so.  And they're filming, and the whole city shut down, because Rocky VI is going on.  Rocky.  It's all about Rocky, and that city's still.  And they're dressed like every era of Rocky.  Like, there's the raw and Rocky.  Right?  There's the fucking mob collector Rocky.  There's the, what to do with the boxer with AIDS.  Yeah.  Fucking stat Rocky. 
[00:36:30]  Is there them?  I'm scared, all right?  I'm scared.  Is that what you want to hear?  People?  People got their father's dressed as Burgess Meredith.  And they're just angry.  But you know what?  They fucking, they were okay.  I was just sitting there, and back into the back of the room, my hand in my head, my head  in my hand, like, I'm just going to have to listen to these fucking animals all night  go, ah!  But only a couple of times.  They were good, man.  I really did have a good time there. 
[00:37:00]  They were, they were, yeah, I did have a great time.  Here's the most important question, because we all heard your promo, like, for a month  straight.  Not one big beard.  No, you know why?  I think at the competing, the competing club out there, I think there's, like, a more black  certified performer back out there.  Oh, yeah.  More, just more, like, I think, I think there's, like, a black star.  What is the big beard thing about it, Philly?  I still don't get it.  It's a thing they do down there.  It's like an oversized goatee, right? 
[00:37:30]  It's not a full beard?  It's like an oversized goatee that gets really, like, bushy?  It's a humongous goatee.  It's a goatee.  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a bin Laden, you know?  A bin Laden.  You get a bin Laden going.  Wow.  But those.  Is it a black thing down there?  It's a black thing, and.  But the white boys are doing it, too.  Some white guys are doing it, too.  But I think theirs is more like a bushy, oversized goatee.  It's like a gangster thing, too.  It was, like, my way, when I say it, it was my way to just go, hey, what's up, like,  to the black people in Philly, but not to go, hey, all big beards come, because those 
[00:38:00]  dudes are serious, like, you know, they're not.  Yeah.  Comedy goers, they're fucking throwing you through a window.  So, I'm like, hey, show up if you want, but, you know, I'd rather deal with all these  white kids dressed as Rocky.  Right.  Before we move on, you've got to hear this guy, Don in Chicago.  Don?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm sitting here at O'Hare, just waiting to get on a plane to fly up to Philly to go  see the show tonight.  He's flying from Chicago just to see Patrice tonight.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:38:30]  Good luck.  Put that little, I'm putting that pressure on me, motherfucker.  You better do it.  That's pressure on you now.  I told you to put your nuts in a fucking mousetraper.  Brian Regan's got to perform for the nut guy.  He's got to give him a good show.  This guy's flying.  Somebody says that, because I'm happy with, you must have people say, dude, I came all  the way out here from Saskatchewan.  And you go, hmm.  We would do road shows at, like, Mulcahy's out on Long Island, and the place is just 
[00:39:00]  packed.  And people would come in and go, dude, I flew in from Sacramento just to, you know, see  this show.  And me and Opie are backstage going, we didn't plan anything.  We didn't put, like, we're just going to bring freaks up on the stage and maybe have  some girls dyke off or something like that.  But this guy flew out, you know, we should, weeks in advance going, okay, I'll hit my  mark at 8.02, and Opie, you follow up, I'll put an X on the stage, have a stage, a choreography,  we're dancing. 
[00:39:30]  This guy flew out from Sacramento, and we're just, like, giving him nothing.  Nothing.  Thanks a lot, dude.  And have a good trip.  Hey, man.  All right.  Yeah, thanks.  Appreciate it.  All right.  Wow.  You see this guy out there?  Oh, my God.  He looks like the guy from Goonies.  Is he?  Oh, Jesus.  God, I was stuck in the elevator.  Good God, I'm from Goonies.  Oh, man.  Has anyone asked these guys what they're all about yet?  Jesus, do you have to even ask that?  Dude, look, poor guy. 
[00:40:00]  He can't.  He's half deaf as well.  Take a pen and a pad and see what we got out there.  Ask them their name and why they're here.  What's this mess?  Well, these are the ones we've allowed up so far.  Oh, really?  So you've got more.  There's other people showing up.  You know, it's American Mess.  Open call.  You just show up at the station.  Steve, you know what these guys are about already?  We will soon.  Bill's going through them right now.  Bill, uh.  The vets system for the messes.  Okay.  How many we got out there?  Met vets.  Two or three.  Two or three so far?  And then the regulars.  We've got Big A and Twitchells.  They're like, uh.  Big A, man. 
[00:40:30]  That's huge to believe.  Neil looks bigger on camera.  Which one is Neil?  Neo.  The little guy.  You know, the one that looks like the guy from Goonies?  Yeah, he looks bigger on camera.  On Pal Talk.  Why bother even having a contest?  It's like we're picking a softball team and Willie Mays is sitting out there.  I mean, that guy wins.  It's over.  Why vote?  Yeah, but what is he going to do, though?  I don't know what he's got.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:41:00]  The biggest disappointment on this show so far was when Half a Hulk Face showed up and  we got so excited.  Like, we found the next Big A and Twitchells.  And then he sat on that mic as serious could be and gave us nothing.  Nothing.  Just a drop face.  Just a horrendous.  He looks like he's got a gump stuff.  And since he has this quiet dignity and this Indian dignity, like, you know, me, not make  fun of me, you know, life.  It's like, dude, just go with whatever is going on, man. 
[00:41:30]  And the dude's just like, like, pretending like he, and then he just puts you in an uncomfortable  spot by being one of these guys that looks you directly in the eye and, yeah.  Stop.  Like he read one of those fucking self-help books and it's just like, I'm going to hypnotize  you to think that my face is not near my kneecaps.  Stop with the dignity.  Stop with your fucking quiet confidence, you half a Hulk face, man.  Stop it, man.  Let's go to Troy in Philly. 
[00:42:00]  Troy.  Hey, how's it going?  Wait, Bill, hold on a little.  What's up, Troy?  What's up?  Anthony.  Hey.  I'm one of your black friends on Mindspace.  You can put me on your top eight.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'll have to look for you in the crowd of friends.  Should be easy to pick out.  Yeah.  I actually might have to change my profile because I'm also the whitest black guy, like  black girl.  So I might have to go in there and put, like, my display name is The Real Cowboy Troy. 
[00:42:30]  So I might have to go change it to, like, The Real Nigga Troy or something like that.  I'll have to look for you, sir.  Hey, Troy, you realize your commercial, your phone call went nowhere, right?  Right.  I know.  You were hoping for a little better.  When did you realize, like, oh, fuck, man, they don't give a shit and I'm bombing.  Yeah, I know.  I suck.  All right, Troy.  Thank you.  We got Bill, the intern, in studio.  Dressed like a cast member from The Perfect Storm. 
[00:43:00]  Sturbing Glossler.  That's great.  What's that show that you like on A&E or whatever?  The Deadliest Catch?  Oh, yeah.  The Deadliest Catch.  He's a crab fisherman.  Then they went into the icy waters.  You would definitely be the guy that had to crawl in and put the bait in the cage.  That's brilliant, man.  Hoping to get out before it just automatically flies over the edge of the ship.  Fucking brilliant. 
[00:43:30]  Yes, sir.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Casual.  How are you doing?  So far, we got a couple guys up here.  Yeah, apparently we've got two guys.  We got Peter.  In parentheses, Neo is God.  He has arthritis, asthma, scoliosis, lordosis, kyphosis, kyphosis.  Stop it.  I can't even work.  You want to get big guys.  He's got osis, osis.  You guys will read that.  He just has osis in general. 
[00:44:00]  Just osis.  You would just have a general osis over your body.  I could go into detail, but it's easier for me.  Osis, osis, osis, osis.  It's easier for the people to do the paperwork at the insurance company if we just say, your  body is just covered in an osis.  He has osis.  He has osis.  Osis is out.  Osis to the power of four.  Osis squared. 
[00:44:30]  Wow.  What the hell?  You missed the osis.  What was that last osis?  Can you redo the osises?  Okay.  He's got arthritis, asthma, scoliosis, what looks like lordosis, and kyphosis.  Wow.  And then something that starts M-O-R-Q, and then I can't read the rest.  Markosis, probably.  Alright, we'll see what he's about in a little while.  Then we got Kevin, who has a glass eye, a skin disorder, and scoliosis.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:45:00]  This is just going to...  A glass eye.  The osis show, yeah.  I just had to woof these eggs down.  Yeah, for sure.  The osis and Anthony show.  You learn very quickly on this program, on days like this, you eat fast, and you eat early.  As you're talking, I have feta cheese in my eggs.  It's just like, oh, this is an osis.  I have an egg white and osis.  I bet you that's what osis would taste like.  You would have to imagine what osis tastes like.  I'm choking down my delicious arm, and it starts to look like mitosis. 
[00:45:30]  It's like a ugly brother, just walking the food down there.  Quick, quick.  We're getting a report on osis, man.  David, California, what's up?  What's up?  I just want to talk about that Neo is God.  It's like one of the most annoying people at Pal Talk.  He gets down there and tries to do an old Jimmy bit, but it's so tired and so wrong.  Well, give him a break.  Yeah, he's got some osis.  He's got osis.  He's got osis, man.  He's got some osis, man. 
[00:46:00]  Don't you?  He's got a grade on a curve, man.  The guy's got osis.  Yeah.  Give him a break.  No, sorry, dog.  You've got to use the bell curve on that one.  The fact that he's even trying to be for, we're looking at him.  It's like I'm overweight by 100 pounds, and my sense of humor, I'm having trouble  keeping a sense of humor just being overweight.  I know, right?  Let alone with osis all over.  And it's just got to be a bit, like, I get annoyed when it's cold out because in order  to leave the house, I've got to take the extra time to put a jacket on.  Right.  And I'm like, it pisses me off that I've got to hold my sleeves and put the jacket on. 
[00:46:30]  It's like, ah, this guy, to get out of the house, has got to just be a bitch.  Just like, oh, I've got osis and I've got to leave.  It's cold off.  It's cold, yeah, he's got the arthritis, the chair, just walking around.  Hey, get a little perspective.  Yeah, we're going to meet the osis.  For like a minute.  We'll meet the osis, man.  His name is osis.  After the break.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris?  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  What's going on, man?  How are you? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to come down today and put my foreskin in the mousetrap.  What?  I want to put his what?  Foreskin.  You want a snap?  An American with a foreskin?  I love it.  Your foreskin in a mousetrap.  Wow, that would trump scrotum skin.  I don't know how much nerve and sensitivity and stuff is in the air.  It's a piece of skin.  Don't look at me when you're asking that question.  I've been doing it for years.  Who's, uh...  You've been doing it for years, I said.  Who's an egg roll?  You've got a stun gun.  We got an egg roll in here?  We got a peeler?  Any peelers?  Don't look at me. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, don't look at no black guy.  Black mommas make sure that ugly shit is off.  Cut that shit off.  My child ain't walking around with no goddamn elephant trunk.  Look at like a pug's face.  I've got my cap with his helmet.  Don't worry.  Goddamn cock with a sharp face on me.  Put some fucking mic up on their full skin.  Pug-based dick.  How close are you, Chris?  I'm heading to work right now.  It's in hell of a book, and I could blow right past there and be here in about an hour. 
[00:48:00]  Wow.  Do you want anything for this?  Um, yeah, just come up and then and say, how are you guys?  So, what's up to Patrice?  The whole thing, you know?  All right, we'll owe you one.  You come by and do that, we'll owe you one.  We'll give you tickets to something.  Amazing.  Jesus.  On his full skin.  All right, Chris in Jersey is on his way to take a mousetrap to the foreskin.  You told Gammon about that shit.  He saw the video.  The video's up.  It's already been downloaded like five, six thousand times.  It's only been up a few hours.  Dude, it's not even, it's not, it's not even, it just makes you cringe in the mouth.  It's like a kick in the fucking balls. 
[00:48:30]  It just, it just was just, it's really shocking.  Well, let's play the audio for Gavin.  It was shocking.  We, we do want to replay it today.  Why don't we replay it here?  All right.  This is from yesterday.  Uh, I don't know how this started.  I guess a guy wanted to go see Brian Regan.  Oh, wait, but did the Connecticut guy, like, did y'all even give him like a, uh, like a  shout out or something just because he suggested, that guy did steal his idea.  You know something?  You're right.  He just happened to be in a position to, to make it happen.  Now this guy might get popular from this, but the guy, the guy in Connecticut, man, 
[00:49:00]  that was his thing.  Yeah.  He ripped off the Connecticut guy.  He ripped him off.  Tell him, Fred.  He ripped off the Connecticut guy.  Who, who?  Tell him, Fred.  I invented a testicles and a mousetrap.  Who the hell are you?  But he doesn't do it on the ball, does he?  He does it on, like, his sack.  His sack.  Yeah, it can't be on a ball.  Yeah, because the ball would be back.  No, we made that call.  Oh, no.  We made that call.  We made that call because no balls.  We want to keep broadcasting for a while.  Okay, I'm sorry.  That would be such a...  The guy was open to the possibility to take it right on the ball.  That would affect you. 
[00:49:30]  You would have to go to the hospital.  You would get a, you would have a rupture.  Your testee would be, you would have to go to the hospital.  There would be no, no paperwork he could sign that could save, that could save you guys  from a suit.  By the way, a full disclosure.  By the way, bravo to the lawyers, because they allow that to happen.  Yes.  Bravo to the lawyers.  They have an open mind.  Because it happened so quickly.  Self-inflicted.  It happened so quickly.  And he's not a suing you guy.  I think even if his balls exploded in his sack, I think he wouldn't have suing you. 
[00:50:00]  He would have been happy to...  His whole presence was like, I'm happy to just do this damage.  He was just glad to be here.  Yeah, he was so happy to just be around.  That's great.  Well, so he wanted to go see Brian Regan.  He came in and he took a mousetrap to the scrotum.  The video's up on opanthony.com.  It's getting downloaded like crazy already.  But here is how it went down yesterday.  This is quick.  Here's the audio.  We are ready.  Okay.  Well, pull it out again. 
[00:50:30]  Stretch as much as you can stretch.  Make sure it's just bagged.  Do I have to pull it off again?  Once it clips, you do whatever you need to do.  You're brave enough to let it dangle so we get a good shot for the video.  Are we ready?  All right.  Wait, should we do it on three?  No.  I guess let's all be quiet and when he feels it, he'll do it.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Keep your fingers out of the way.  Get a lot of stretch there.  There you go.  I think his fingers are in the way. 
[00:51:00]  Your fingers are in the way.  It's going to be very hard.  You're going to have to stretch a lot.  Stretch it out.  But keep the nuts.  There you go.  Just the edge.  Dude, oh my God.  This is not right.  Here we go.  Wait, is the mousetrap on the edge good enough?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Breathe, breathe.  Holy shit.  What am I doing?  Ready?  Go.  Go.  Oh, my God. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, you can't get it off.  You've got to open it, motherfucking one.  Oh, my God.  You slanted all that.  Words can't describe that for the first time. 
[00:52:00]  For the first time in our careers, words cannot describe that.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that had to hurt.  Did I tell you the second show said it was canceled?  Oh, my God.  And there you have it from yesterday.  Oh, my God.  I'm not comfortable with that at all.  That was a...  And he was so...  Here's the thing that was...  Even if the snap...  After the snap...  Mm-hmm.  He was in such shocking pain... 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  ...that he couldn't even gather himself to...  He was looking around for someone to help him open the trap off his scroll.  Help me, help me.  Scrotum.  Yeah.  And it was so fucking cutting off the circulation to something.  I bet you...  I mean, I'm sure scrotums need blood circulation.  But...  And he...  And I...  Shit, he slid it off to get it off.  He slid it.  Didn't even open up the jaws of the mousetrap.  His mind was gone and no one would help.  And he was just...  Who's going to help him? 
[00:53:00]  Who the hell's going to help him?  Please.  Let me grab that for you there, pal.  Please get this off my scrotum.  Here's the video.  I've seen it now.  This is the fifth time I'm watching this.  Yikes.  It's on opianthony.com.  Stretching it.  You've got to check out this video.  Stretching it over.  Oh my God.  Check out the video and email it to a friend.  That's how we spread the virus for this program.  See, he smiles a little bit.  I can't look at...  Well, he was...  He was on like meds.  Oh, code or whatever.  I think he was on something.  Yeah, he was...  Dude, that's...  He was self-medicating before he did that. 
[00:53:30]  It's the sliding part that's the most pamphlet, I think.  That was one of the funniest things we've ever seen and the most disturbing.  Well, I don't know.  This foreskin look is good.  The foreskin might top that, man.  I mean, who the hell...  There you go.  How does he know to do that?  That's what we do here, by the way.  We're still doing radio here instead of bitching how we can't do radio.  The foreskin guy said that he's been doing it for years.  That's what I mean.  So, he probably has calluses built up.  He's got some calluses, man.  It's not going to hurt.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Foreskin osis.  Foreskin osis.  Jesus.  God.  Bring him in.  I'm on the way to get my foreskin pissed.  Yeah.  Let's go to Willie in Connecticut.  Willie!  Oh, my God, you guys.  I just about crashed my truck.  All I could feel was my legs closing together.  Yeah, man.  There's nothing.  I'm a mousetrap, man.  Yeah.  Ouch.  I love it.  You guys are the best.  Welcome, Connecticut.  Tell a friend about that video clip.  I already sent it.  Oh, good.  That's where you guys can help us out.  Use that clip to help spread the virus.  Thanks, Willie.  We love you, Connecticut. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Let's go to Angel.  She's a trucker.  Angel.  Yes.  Angel.  Yeah, I'm here.  What do you got?  Good.  I want to say I've raised your show.  You guys are great.  I listen to it every morning.  Thank you, Angel.  Thank you.  All right.  Especially when you all pick on Jimmy, because that's where I'm from out there in California.  I laughed my ass off on that show you guys season them at those hookers.  All right on.  Yeah, Jimmy's coming back on Monday. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, that's cool.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  She has nothing.  Let's go to Jay in Chocolate City.  Jay.  What's happening, guy?  What's up, Jay?  Come on.  Look, Gavin just said he was real uncomfortable with that guy getting his ball sack pinched in a trap.  Yeah.  He's the guy that brought that camera phone in with the guy getting reamed in the air.  That's correct.  But let me point out to you, I was the guy on the camera.  So, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Gavin has seen some shit in his days, but he was disturbed by that video clip. 
[00:55:30]  I was disturbed.  That's painful, my friend.  My friend had joy out of that.  That is a good point he made.  I was like...  Yeah.  You're the same guy that watched a friend get boned in the air by a hooker with a strap on?  And it was minutes and minutes of horror.  Like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't just a quick thing.  A split second of just a little pain.  Got a point.  I'm sorry.  And then you laughing.  Dude, it's still the funniest thing in my life, that is.  You've got to date.  But, I mean... 
[00:56:00]  Osis looks like a fucking candle.  He looks like a...  He just...  It's just fucking...  It's just...  Osis, it's just...  Oh, man.  Pull his fucking shade down.  This is so sad.  Pull his shade down.  Look at Big A.  He looks like the leader of the group out there.  He looks like a mob boss.  Hey, listen.  Osis, shut up.  Wait.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Osis, I'm running this shit.  So, dude, don't ask too many questions.  Just...  He looks like a godfather out there.  It does.  Stepping on some toes.  Are the big eyes actually getting bigger?  It's like a big eye, big eye.  I don't want eyes.  I'll fucking peel his...  Moses, this is my territory, don't go stepping on no toes, fuck that big A, I'll fucking 
[00:57:00]  peel his foot, I'll peel his cap wall, it's my territory, I'll make him an offer that'll take  two hours to save, you said that, wow, tell big A he sleeps with the, 
[00:57:30]  hey, we got big A and Twitchels, they're going to do the news today, they should do it soon  actually, I got some guys in England actually listening to this show today, so I want to  see what their response is, hey, Raphael, this is getting uglier, guys, Raphael in Connecticut, 
[00:58:00]  what do you got for the show?  Alright, since I got ripped off yesterday, hoo hoo hoo, oh, you're the guy that came  up with the scrotum thing?  Fucking Gaga, I failed for him, God, I got ripped off, but it's okay, he was closer, he went  down and did it, now, I want to challenge him next week, holy shit, wait, wait, wait, hold  on, hold on, we didn't really hear, we heard challenge, and then what?  I want to challenge him to a duel, a mousetrap to the balls, to see who can take it more 
[00:58:30]  times to the balls, who have the bigger balls, NYC or CT?  What is the criteria here, just how many times?  Sometimes you can take a snap and a snap, we have a weekend to figure it out, maybe we'll  bring a rat trap in, that would chop the lower half of your sack off and your balls would  fall out.  Oh, that's what, as soon as he said a challenge, I knew what he was going to say, it was just 
[00:59:00]  like a fucking scrotum sack challenge, he's like, oh, is this a fool, is it 12, is it?  Alright, you know what, that's why I reacted like that, like, oh, I can just see what he's  saying.  Raphael, call him out right now on the air, we'll see if he calls in.  I am calling you out, Matt, to the ball bag challenge.  Wow.  To the ball bag challenge, fuck American, reject, or retard, or whatever you guys got going.  Yeah, American mess, my friend, get it right.  Yeah.  The banner and everything.  Yeah.  Oh, she says. 
[00:59:30]  I'm challenging Matt to see who can take it to the balls.  The ball.  Would you take a glue trap?  I'll bring a bear trap in.  A what?  I'll bring a fucking bear trap in.  A bear trap?  A bear trap, well that's what you need.  How big are your balls, my friend?  That clanking metal bear trap slamming shit.  Did you, was you mad when it was happening?  Was you automatically, was you immediately fucking pissed off when this guy ran in with  your ball thing?  Honestly, when he called up, I didn't think he was going to come down, and he did, and 
[01:00:00]  it pissed me off.  But it's alright.  He took away the publicity, but it's okay.  So Thursday, I'll challenge him, I'll say it again, ball bag challenge.  Who could, maybe we'll attach him and see who could keep it on the balls the longest.  I might get desensitized after the first couple of minutes.  We'll figure it out.  Yeah, we'll figure out what, what.  Maybe we'll do a whole Icy Hot, Mouse Trap, Glue Trap.  What your balls, the Ball Olympics, or the Ball Decathlon, where your balls have to go through 
[01:00:30]  a number of, like, different competitions.  The ball games.  Yes.  What the ball games.  The Ball Olympics.  Ball Catathlon, where I want Matt to call the show now.  If you hear Matt on the air, you've got to call right back, Raphael, alright?  Wow.  We'll get you guys trash talking and all that, but as soon as I hear that faggot, I'll call  right back.  Wow.  The big ball off.  Challenge is on.  We'll see if Matt takes the challenge for next Thursday. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, you've got to feel for that, dude.  He came up with the idea that originally Matt just was in, he was in the area.  Yeah.  He was in the area.  What scares me is how these guys come up with these ideas.  I mean, what you do, casually sitting there, and you just accidentally fall your balls onto a trap?  I don't know.  How do you know that you can take that?  Let's go to John in Connecticut.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You're awesome.  Hey.  I want to ask Anthony, aren't you a little concerned that Osis might be contagious?  That Osis might be contagious?  No, I don't think he's contagious.  Okay. 
[01:01:30]  I'm not crazy like that, my friend.  I'm not going to wipe his ass for him or his nose or anything like that.  Yeah.  I'll keep him on the other side of the room.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Let's go to Yayo.  Yayo?  Hey.  What's up, Yayo?  Guys, please don't fucking do this.  This is going to be the end of you.  This is the next fucking St. Pat's.  Well, you got to keep it edgy.  You got to keep taking chances, my friend.  Oh, shit.  That fucking wall is lopped off, and it's going to be the end of you, guys.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We'll try to figure it out so we're all safe. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, my God.  What, Anthony?  Well, we just got Neo's stats, his spec sheet on his diseases.  His resume.  We got his resume.  Morquio syndrome.  What the hell?  Which is close to Mercurio syndrome.  That's why you have big lips and ruin people's careers.  Is it looking like a nightmare?  Morquio.  Listen to what this is.  Oh, my God.  That deserves more than a guy.  Thank you, Patrice.  How's Jesus ever caring?  Yeah.  Morquio syndrome. 
[01:02:30]  This disease is so bad, you can't even pronounce half the words in it.  Is a syndrome is a mucopolysaccharide storage disease.  Holy crap.  A deficiency of enzymes leads to the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the body, abnormal  skeletal development, and additional symptoms, in most cases, individuals with Morquio syndrome.  Abnormal intelligence symptoms may include growth retardation.  A prominent lower face, an abnormally short neck, knees that are abnormally close together, 
[01:03:00]  in parentheses, knock knees, or genuvalgum, flat feet, abnormal sideways and front to back  or side to side curvature of the spine, kyphoscoliosis, abnormal development of the growing ends of  the long bones, epiphysis, and or a prominent breastbone, pectus coronatum. 
[01:03:30]  I am pectus coronatum.  American family.  Hearing loss, weakness of the legs, and or additional abnormalities may also occur.  Just so many, they just ran out.  Random shit.  Ah, yes, all my fallout.  What can I tell you, kid?  Doc, I'm missing my eye.  Ah, it's just one of those things.  What are you going to do? 
[01:04:00]  May I suggest something?  Yes.  Let's see if Big A can read the same thing.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't end there.  He also has kyphosis.  Kyphosis.  One second, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Certainly, Patrice.  So that, okay, all these parentheses and everything.  Yeah.  That was just that one disease.  That's that one syndrome.  And all that shit was in there.  All that shit.  So the epiphysis and kyphosocosilus, that all was under the umbrella of the Marquiai syndrome. 
[01:04:30]  It's like the Kellogg's variety pack of disease.  It's under one banner, but you could get Special K.  Ah, you could get Frosted Flakes.  And that's under one.  Right.  So that's the Kellogg's of.  The Kellogg's variety pack of disease.  Wow.  Wow.  They should boil this down to one sentence.  Fucked.  It looks like you got way too close to the sun. 
[01:05:00]  You're just a mess.  Let's go to Doug out Doug.  Doug.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I found Neo.  Oh.  I found Neo on Xbox 360 Live, and as soon as I heard his voice, I said, you've got to  come to Pal Talk, son.  And he came to Pal Talk.  I love how the pets are out there just recruiting.  They're recruiting.  Well, job well done, Doug.  Yes.  I sent in some audio, I don't know if the guys got it, from the karaoke night where Neo 
[01:05:30]  did a lot of rapping for us.  He did a little Beyonce for us.  Neo is a special guy.  You know what?  Any karaoke this weekend?  The karaoke will have to be next Friday in the Pal Talk room.  We do it every other Friday, because every other Friday night, I bartend.  Yeah, this is the deal with this show.  It's becoming a lifestyle.  It's not about the radio show anymore.  The radio show's just a part of it.  But Neo is also a huge wrestling fan, and if you have the music, he likes to act like  his favorite wrestlers when they come down to the ring. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  No one's beating Neo.  We're going to do this every Friday, but I think we've got an early leader.  Hey, Doug, they just handed me the karaoke, so stay on the line.  I want to play this for everybody.  Yes, sir.  Here it is.  Neo doing his karaoke.  But where was he? 
[01:06:30]  Now, where's he, Doug?  Is he in here?  He's in the background.  Try one of the other tracks.  Yeah, maybe that one was a little, the music was a little too loud.  Yeah.  Well, they only gave me, maybe this is a montage.  I don't know.  How much air can he push out of those myopacists as long as he's going to be like, he's going  to be like, he's going to be like, he has a cigar and a fucking, the guy's pushing.  Brandy Snicker.  Is this the guy with a belt on his shoulder? 
[01:07:00]  Is it the belt dude, is he?  No.  Is it the belt dude, is he?  We don't even know what that guy's about.  Because that guy's going to be the shit out of the million pounds.  He's going to be the melty guy, right?  That's the belt guy.  Oh, that's a, that's a, that's a monk.  Wait, which one is Neo?  I'm thinking it's the melted dude.  It's the guy next to, you're Neo?  You're Neo?  Yeah.  You're Neo?  Oh, this is, wait a minute.  Who did he think was?  Oh my God, that looks like the dude from Judy's.  You thought it was, you thought it was Candleman.  This is the guy, this is, oh, this is the guy.  Oh, that's who I thought it was. 
[01:07:30]  I didn't even see him back there.  He was the guy, he was the guy who was in the list.  Oh, wait a minute, now game on, because I'm like, this Neo guy's got this competition  won, but now we're not even talking about him?  No, Neo's pure personality, but Candleface is not Candleface.  Oh my God.  That's why my brother was saying too close to the sun, because we thought we were talking  about the guys.  No, I thought.  That's not osus.  Fucking Neo's osus.  There's a challenge on right now with the rest of the way. 
[01:08:00]  So what's the deal with that guy who's all fucked up?  Yeah, I don't know, we'll find out what he's about.  He's a mess.  Can we finish Neo's stats here?  Yes, I'm sorry.  Oh my God.  Now this is the kid, and he's a young kid.  Yeah.  Like, sort of, I guess, looks 20, or maybe not even.  Guys, kyphosis, which is a hunching over, is normal in the thoracic spine.  Some kyphosis is normal.  When the doctor measures it on an x-ray, the normal range for kyphosis is quite broad, between  20 and 50 degrees.  However, when kyphosis is greater than 50 degrees, it becomes easy to see, and is considered 
[01:08:30]  abnormal.  He's like at 360 degrees.  Lunatic.  There are no clear visual clues that distinguish normal from abnormal kyphosis.  The doctor's experience is usually the best indicator for what amount of kyphosis is abnormal.  Kyphosis may be accentuated with forward bending.  And lordosis, it is lordosis, sway back.  Abnormal lordosis may also accompany scoliosis, which he has. 
[01:09:00]  Abnormal lordosis is an excessive forward curve in the upper or lower back.  So he is like...  He's a mess.  They just put him in a bender, in some kind of bending unit, and just like bent him.  Yeah, like he's been on the rack.  And not only is it disturbing of what he has, it's disturbing that there's a doctor out there  that specializes in kyphosis.  Kyphosis.  I'm thinking we're looking at about a 75 degree kyphosis here. 
[01:09:30]  It's very serious.  The good part, if you just missed, because at a 90 degree kyphosis, you can suck your own  cock.  All right, let's go to Rich real fast in Jersey.  Rich, what's up?  Dude, you've got to forget about Icy Hop.  Try capsaicin.  It's an arthritis cream.  It burns like 10 times worse.  Write that down.  Write that down.  Spell it as well.  Yeah, spell it for us. 
[01:10:00]  We don't even know if Matt's going to take the challenge on.  We've got to hear from Matt either way today to see how his scrotum is.  Punch it out.  All right, thank you, sir.  Too late.  There's a couple other things, and we're going to take a break.  Seth in Boston.  Seth.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  I just joined in, but I know that, you know, I've talked to Neo a couple times on PalTalk.  He's a really good guy.  You'll enjoy him?  Yeah.  When you get Twitchels and Big A in the studio together, ask Big A to do his Twitchels impressions.  He was imitating Twitchels last night on PalTalk. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, wow.  He does impressions, too.  He don't like, he fucking, no, Big A.  Yeah, Big A does impressions.  Does he really?  On Twitchels.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Let him down to Big A.  Let him give it up for him.  Give it up.  Oh, you know, the other day, I saw George Burns talking with Phyllis Diller.  That might sound something like this. 
[01:11:00]  He's got to do the turn away.  He's turned back again like he's another person.  Old school impressionist.  Both of them sound like he's up there.  Say goodnight.  Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.  So I was standing in Hollywood in Vines.  It's going to be a hell of a day. 
[01:11:30]  Pete in California.  Pete, what's up?  Yo, what's up, Bonet?  Hey, Pete.  What's up, Patrice and the Duchess Queen Ferry?  How are you doing, my friend?  Look at Gav, they don't like no faces, man.  He's like, this fucking wanker.  Gav always choked a mic.  Come on.  Get down this mic.  Kick your ass.  Blow your head off.  And he's not funny.  I know he's not funny.  Don't talk about the Queen about that, though.  Gav, his head turns to the side.  Yeah, huh?  You call me a fucking queen, man.  I don't mind.  I don't mind.  I get to kill him. 
[01:12:00]  I don't mind.  What do you got, Pete?  I'm up here in California.  First time I get to listen to you live, so I don't fucking wake up.  Before I am out here.  Yeah.  But I'm on my way up here duck hunting.  I was just thinking, I'm a converted hoo-hoo fan, man.  I'm fucking pissed at Stern.  I bought my wife dog shit, because she fucking, man, every time I tried to get her list to  O&A, you guys either had to have that horse fucking that dude's ass, or the fucking dude  fucking the chicken. 
[01:12:30]  And I'm like, man, you got to listen to this show.  That's the only time.  We have bestiality.  Bestiality.  No, they do more than that, I swear.  And, dude, now you're talking about the dude getting his anteater squished with the mousetrap.  I'm like, oh.  He's on his way in, by the way.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Well, I just want to say, man, XM's got it right.  Here's five, man.  You know, I'm in stage, the 18 to 35.  You guys appeal to the right age group.  Oh, thanks, Pete.  I'm selling radios all the time to my buds, and right on, man.  You guys rock.  Awesome. 
[01:13:00]  Spread it around.  We definitely appreciate that.  Spread it around.  Speaking of hoo-hoo, we should play a couple more of these Emily Stern remixes as we go  to break.  Oh, I love these.  These are coming in like crazy, but we're sorting through them to make sure.  We're trying to get some of the better ones.  Some of them are pretty redundant.  Yeah.  They've been done before.  Definitely.  Some of them just plain suck, but a few of them, there's still some creativity to be found  in those limited clips of Emily Stern when she was doing her little Jewish play, getting 
[01:13:30]  naked on stage, got a lot of press from it.  Howie got all pissed off and must have told her to knock it off because she quit, but the  audio is still out there, and video, and I've done all.  That's right.  Here's one by Mims.  My ass are all godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly. 
[01:14:00]  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.  My kids are godly.

My kids are godly.  got a good beat. That one's good. That's Emily. Wait, he's still going. Oh. Fuck you. He's  still going. He's almost done. He's calming down. He's down to a dribble. All right. 
[01:15:00]  That was the world's loudest orgasm guy. Yeah. Very good. Emily Stern. That's by Mims.  The Tom Jones one is my favorite. Oh, really? Oh, the one with the dry vagina song. I really  enjoyed that. Yeah, that is a good one. We got another one done to the actual Tom Jones  song, which is very similar to the one you like. This is being heard for the first time 
[01:15:30]  to listen to this.  My, my, my, dry vagina.  Why, why, why, dry vagina.  Oh, do we want an FF, please? I just love that shit, man. Fucking Tom Jones.  By the way, welcome aboard, Patrice. I see it happening. Sneaky, sneakily getting in there  to get a fucking head. There it is again. This is great. 
[01:16:00]  Why, why, why, why, dry vagina. Why, why, why, dry vagina. Oh, he could have just kept going.  Oh, it didn't. Isn't that Tom Jones something?  Maybe he's from Wiles as well. From Wiles. He's from Wiles. Yes, he is. What a set of pipes  on that guy. We got one more. One more featuring Howard, his ex-wife Allison, and his daughter, 
[01:16:30]  Emily. Listen to this one. Where's the kids? You want to put Emily on? Daddy wants us to talk  to you. Let Emily get on. Sexual. Hi, Em. It's Daddy. Sexual. Sexual. Say hi to everyone.  My breath. In my teeth. Now you're speaking better, Emily. My ass. I can buy you toys.  In my time now. Are you watching Sesame Street? T.I.T. Do you want to sing Sesame Street? 
[01:17:00]  Papa, don't preach. I've been losing steam. I'm gonna keep my baby.  I'm just thrilled. I'm so proud. This is the most exciting, exciting time. It's just amazing,  and the kids love me by the time now. Oh, it's Daddy. My ass. When Dad leaves, this  is what happens. Love me, Daddy. Love me, Daddy. Come on, Fred. Cool. Well, go fuck yourself.  The editing falls apart at the end. Yeah, that was pretty good, though. Wow. But you get 
[01:17:30]  the idea. Hey, don't feel so bad, Howard. At least someone can play your old clips.  At least they're being played somewhere. Yeah. All right. We got a lot of show to do  today. Yeah. I guess we'll meet Neo next, huh? Might as well. Him and his Osises. We got  to start with Neo. I say Neo's the headliner, dude. I don't know, though. I didn't see the  other guy over there. Oh, Kendall Feist. Yeah, I didn't see him. But Neo got all kinds of 
[01:18:00]  personality. Do we have a bio on what his story is? The other guy? Kendall Feist. The other  guy? Yeah, find out what that guy's about. All we know so far, he has a glass eye, skin  disorder, scoliosis, and partial deafness, so you got to yell at him. His name should be  Icarus, because he flew too close to the sun, so we can just call him that. Mercury. You guys  are pricks. What happened? I'm just reading the news that my children Big A are going to  be reading. We know that Big A has a problem with S-T words. Yeah. He has a problem with 
[01:18:30]  every word, but the S-T words are very difficult. So when the guys get together and write the  news copy for him, now it's just every single story starts out. They're just the cruelest  bastards. You know, we need to talk about the news, so why don't we do Big A and  Twitchell's reading the news next, and then we'll meet Neo. Love you, excellence.  Anthony's losing it. I love it. Nathaniel's so creatively cruel. Actually, everybody's 
[01:19:00]  helped out. Travis, Nathaniel, and Danny wrote the news for Big A and Twitchell's. We have  another Howard Stern, Emily Stern remix here, by the way. This is a good one.  Wow. That's right. Sit back and take it. That's all you can do, Howie. Let's take a 
[01:19:30]  break. We'll continue with the Opium Anthem program next.  It ain't pretty. I've done the show. It ain't really when the brain is with no place to  go. If you think you need it. You're not going to throw that up, mate? You're not going to 
[01:20:00]  throw that up? All that osis out there? I'm trying to shove some food down my throat. Good  luck for you. Good luck for you. I was taking a leak and eating an egg sandwich at the same  time. Good for you. I miss the old days when you had a 20-minute commercial break where  you could relax, take a dump, get some coffee, eat a sandwich. Out of the question. Out of  the question. Now I've got an egg sandwich in one hand, and I'm holding my dick in the  other. There's something wrong with this. All right, we've got a lot to do today, obviously.  It's American Mess. You see the banner. I mean, it says it all. American Mess, always 
[01:20:30]  messing up family portraits. A fine line from Jim Norton that's now on a banner. Norton's  going to be back on Monday. 2020's going to be in studio filming a little piece with  Jim Norton, and we're going to be a part of that, so that's exciting. Goddamn, my brother's  restaurant opens tonight. FH Riley's in downtown Huntington, 400 New York Avenue. Ribbon cutting  at 430. Ribbon cutting. Free drinks for the politicians, and then it'll open up for business  at 6. What is it, like the Selectmen? Or the Huntington? I don't know. The Huntington 
[01:21:00]  Minute Men. Like, who's the guy that runs Huntington? Who knows. He'll be there, though?  This is a very proud day for all of Huntington. Another business. You know, business is up  in Huntington. 14% over last just blah, blah, re-elect me, blah, blah. I want, like, the  mayor from Jaws to show up. Look, this is a fantastic restaurant. We're going to be serving  quality seafood here, and those beaches will be open. Those bars will be open. Yeah, so 
[01:21:30]  I'll be hanging out there all afternoon long if you want to stop on by and see what the  restaurant's about. Chef, my son was in that bar, too. Sign the paper with his anchor suit.  Amity means friendship. You know what? I've got to get some pictures to get it up on the  website because it's going to be so stupid. My brother doesn't like the spotlight. He's  going to be out there kissing ass, shaking hands, cutting ribbons. Huntington is very 
[01:22:00]  much like Amity. He just wants to go into the kitchen and cook some fine food for everybody.  Yeah, do what he does best. Oh, well. But we'll be kissing some politicians' asses today  in Huntington. Ugh. Ugh. What do you got, Gavin? See, I can't see all the cameras. Gavin  is fixated. I'm in love with this girl on the blacktop. She is fantastic. Talking about  pal talks, obviously. She's absolutely fantastic. There's a girl on here, 84, babe, and she has 
[01:22:30]  been showing. Oh, baby. I love you. God bless America. She's in like a thong. And Gavin  is just in love. God bless America. He is completely in love with this girl. She's  leaving me. She's just walking around. Yeah, she's just doing her thing. God bless her.  We have a guy coming down to take a mousetrap to his foreskin. Let's not forget about that.  No, that's nothing. Actually, that's kind of part of American mess. Yeah, we are looking 
[01:23:00]  for a talent portion. Yeah, we don't want to confuse this American mess thing. It's open  for pretty much anything that's unusual. You ever see on American Idol, sometimes someone  will walk in and they have the look of an American Idol, but their voice isn't quite  as good as some of the other people. But they let them through because they have a part of  it, the look. And then other people might not have the look, but their singing ability  puts them through. It's the same way American mess works. Sometimes it's just the look. 
[01:23:30]  Look, you're a mess. That'll get you through. Other times, maybe you're not as much of a  mess physically, but you do things. Right.  You know, you put your foreskin in a mousetrap. That qualifies. You're going to Hollywood,  dog. Horrendous.  You know? We're looking for a little bit of everything.  Well, you guys want to bring in Big A and Twitchels to do the news?  No, but it's part of the show. We'll get a little news in. 
[01:24:00]  I want to see Big A read this doctor's, whatever it is, stat.  Oh, my God. That could be a bet we could do.  See how long it takes. I'll give you on and over that two minutes tops.  I just picture Twitchels having whiplash all the time. Like, does his neck just hurt like  you were hit?  Today it does a lot.  Rear-ended?  Yeah.  Look, he's wearing a Big A hat as well.  Holy shit. I love your hat, Twitchels.  Dude, your hat is really funny. What does it say on the back?  I rode the short yellow bus, which is accurate. 
[01:24:30]  You know what the best part of that hat is? The handicap logo isn't centered. It's made  so you have to turn it retard sideways in order for the logo to be facing forward.  Wow.  Oh, he's going off today. What's the matter?  You know what? I'll be honest with you. I'm going to be at Chiller Theater this weekend,  which is a big expose of caucus, and I'm so nervous. That's why I'm dressed this way.  I'm going to be there signing copies of my book all weekend, and there's going to be  a lot of celebrities. I'm not usually nervous around them, but I've been doing it. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, wait a minute. We've heard about these cons. Not a lot of celebrities. You're getting  like the guy from episode 136 of The Twilight Zone that played the guy with the mushy face.  Well, I'm excited because Christopher Knight, who's Peter Brady, and his model girlfriend  Agent Curry is going to be there, and my buddy King Kong Bundy, who's the wrestler, and  I know that guy in there.  King Kong Bundy is going to be there?  Yeah, he's a good buddy of mine. We're actually driving back together, too, so he's awesome.  But I'm just so nervous, and my neck is killing me because I've been doing it so much. 
[01:25:30]  You should wear just a neck brace all the time.  Well, when I was little, the doctor suggested that, but I can't. I mean, I'm always going  to do it, so I can't wait.  Wear one of those cages on your head that people wear when they break their neck?  Right.  So he can't move?  This is the first time.  This is the first time I've seen Twitchels where I'm uncomfortable. It looks like you're  in pain today.  No, I'm not in pain.  Doesn't it look like a chore?  God damn it, I hate when people say that. Don't worry. Don't feel uncomfortable. I mean,  I'm always going to do this. Imagine how my freaking parents feel. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  Sorry, man.  The guys in the sound booth always have fun, too.  He's going to jump, and his neck's going to snap.  Oh, now he's going to jump again.  He's fighting the urge, but...  Yeah.  Yeah, so, anyway, I'll be there all weekend.  Hey, what's up, man?  Every time I come here, I feel like Patrice hates me. I really do.  I love you.  No, he doesn't give a shit about me. 
[01:26:30]  Thank you, man.  To be honest, he's just...  Oh, by the way, Patrice, by the way.  Web junk is the greatest stuff. I love it, man.  Good job.  Thank you, man.  Maybe we'll add you in the green screen, or any time we need sound effects to make the fucking  clips a little better. We'll just put fucking twitches in there.  Feel free, man.  Look at Big A standing there looking like...  Big A standing there looking like...  Big A, look at this idiot.  Big A, what's up?  Big A's the only motherfucker who's allowed to not speak on the radio and you know what 
[01:27:00]  he's saying?  Hey, Big A, what's going on?  We all know, baby. We all know.  We're on a delay.  Big A, man.  You are the fucking best thing.  Gavin loves Big A more than anything.  Did I hear he was impersonating me or something?  Yeah, Big A, you impersonate their twitchels or whatever?  Yeah, when pal talk, they were asking me to impersonate him. 
[01:27:30]  That's how I look at it, Big A.  That's how I look at it, I did.  Yeah, let's see you imitate twitchels.  Concentrate. Jesus.  Don't look at him.  Don't look at him.  Because he's comfortable behind the...  I'm not even able to pal talk.  Go ahead, Big A.  Imitate twitchels for everybody.  Um...  Oh my god, that's fucking genius. 
[01:28:00]  Oh my god.  Even on the radio, unfortunately he can't see it, but he's actually doing the twitch as well,  isn't he?  He's full article.  We had like a four-camera shoot today, so a lot of this will be up on the website later  this weekend.  Do a little more twitchels, Big A.  Go ahead.  That's just what he needs. 
[01:28:30]  Another ailment people will think he has.  Jumping up and down, too.  That's very good.  Holy cow.  Oh my god.  Oh man.  Fuck.  Keep me going, man.  All right.  Well, we're going to get some news in with these guys.  Yeah.  I want a week in review with Twitchels and Big A. We like to do this from time to time.  All right.  I guess we're ready. 
[01:29:00]  Whenever you guys want.  It's the news with Big A and Twitchels.  Trying to keep my head set on.  Let's go on, Big A. Let's go.  Drop the presses.  It's time for the news with Big A and Twitchels.  Tarving me, Big A.  And I'm Twitchels.  Till no official's statement as the cause of the death of Star Chris Pence. 
[01:29:30]  Although news details have started to emerge, a coroner spokesman stated that pan suffered from a prior illness 
[01:30:00]  and had taken an ambulance in the past.  The butts are short of aiding the cause of death. 
[01:30:30]  The 40-year-old actor had hard in many films throughout his career, including the 2005  stars-funded Sosky and Hutch film.  Holy cow.  Ex-Proviver cast member Richard Hatch was found guilty Wednesday of tax evasion. 
[01:31:00]  The reality star jumped...  The reality star jumped...  The reality star jumped...  Oh, my God.  I didn't even catch that shit.  They added jump to his freaking copy.  He's jumping now.  You guys are brilliant.  Holy crap.  Shit, you're awful.  All right, you better start over there, Ryan Twitchels.  Oh, well, sure.  Anything for you.  I'm coming.  Okay.  Ex-Proviver cast member Richard Hatch was found guilty Wednesday of tax evasion. 
[01:31:30]  The reality star jumped to fame back in 2000, being the...  Oh, God.  I'm sorry, guys.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Yada, yada, yada, yada.  All right.  Hatch was also found guilty of evading taxes on $327,000 he earned as co-host of a Boston  radio show and $28,000 in rent of property he owned. 
[01:32:00]  He now faces...  He now faces up to 13 years in prison and a $600,000 fine.  Come on, big guy, come on.  Big guy has started the next story, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's not... 
[01:32:30]  He's not sitting there...  Just for the home audience.  He has started his next story.  Come on, big guy, man.  And you can do it.  Come on, big guy.  Come on, big guy.  What?  That's it.  Go ahead, big guy.  You can do it.  Come on.

[01:34:00]  Tari, was, was, was, was, Tari, James Franco, and Therese Gibson.  Wow.  A Department of Education.  A Department of Education mechanist was busted yesterday accused of rigging hidden cameras inside the female locker rooms of two area schools.

[01:35:30]  Nose, stranger, socials, stigma, resembling Jesus Christ,  grabbing a crown on thorns, picking into his forehead. 
[01:36:00]  Roland's drone also recently featured a view of Simon's satellite radio host,  and his stomach-tabled tuge, Bubba the love sponge.

Thanks, Marty.  Thank you so much, man.  Wait till you meet Neo in a few minutes here.

[01:54:30]  And my wife was with us  And he's sitting over there  And he's been in the water  And he comes back up  And he's sitting on a picnic table  And he's drinking a beer  And I look over there  And every time he lifts the beer up  His nuts are hanging out  Oh god  You're wearing his shorts  I couldn't fucking resist  He wins Davey Dukes too  I've had enough to have to look at somebody  Drink with their feet  But then he'll go  Oh his nutsack is hanging out  I couldn't fucking resist  I told my wife  I said you need to take Tony another beer 
[01:55:00]  And by the time she gets about halfway there  I go, hey Tony, drink up  Oh that is funny  How does he open the beer?  You have to open it for him  I guess he could probably open it  You're alone in the house with a beer  That would drive you nuts  You've got to open it with your feet  Try that someday  Try that on some Saturday night at home  You want to drink a little bit  Just go grab a beer  And try to open it with your feet  Well he dresses himself I guess  Because he lives by himself  So I don't know how the fuck  He gets his pants on  Wow  All right Jeff

Look at Patty  You kiss ass  Did you get the job at Starbucks?  I don't have the interview until Monday  But you're walking around now  Just with Starbucks cups  To try to like  You're walking  You pass in front of the store  All the time with a cup  That's from here  Yeah  That's your machine in the back 
[02:03:00]  Alright  I thought you were being like  A kiss ass at Starbucks  We thought stalker Patty  Had the best video clip this week  On the Opie and Anthony show  Her naked crawling around on the floor  Looking for checks  Among mousetraps  While she was blindfolded  Yeah  Gavin you haven't seen that video yet?  That video's up on Opie and Anthony dot com  We thought nothing was going to beat that this week  Most people have forgotten about that stunt already  Or whatever you want to call it  Because of the scrotum guy  That did the mousetrap to his scrotum  And that video's up  So this video is being downloaded like crazy right now 
[02:03:30]  On Opie and Anthony dot com  I had to flip over the channel when that was happening  Shut up  So she's naked and she's running around  Getting jacked up by mousetraps  What the fuck  You gotta see the video of that  She's totally naked  On her hands and knees  Searching the floor for  Two $1,000 checks  And the floor is covered with mousetraps  So she kept screaming  And getting her hands snapped in the mousetraps  Yeah we can play the audio for you Gavin  As we go to break 
[02:04:00]  How you feeling today?  You got snapped pretty good on the hands right?  You know you sound like a chimpanzee in that exact  I mean exactly like a chimpanzee screaming  When you get snapped with a mousetrap  Well I scream when I hurt  When I hurt  I just have a little bruising over here  It's a little tent  There's a little red here and a little red there  And I couldn't type on the computer with my right hand for one day  Great 
[02:04:30]  Look how nervous Patrice  Get to go walk one next door  I was listening to one of the worst ofs yesterday  And it was Patty on the game show  Trying to win the $100 bills  Remember that?  And that culminated with the naked crusty mask  All those clips  It was from that show  That Drew Boogie took him out  To make the Patty Patty Patty song  And it was so funny to hear him in context  Very funny segment 
[02:05:00]  Anytime you're being abused Patty  It's gold  Anytime you're naked and in pain  This show is humming  I forgot all about her crawling around naked  Because he was a scrotum guy  Until I just saw Starker Patty  And went oh my god we did that this week too  I think that Starker Patty thing was  Two different things  I don't know  The scrotum guy was like  Starker Patty was disturbed  It took me a minute to wash that off my mind  I had to rationalize that  Because she just  It wasn't the mousetrap 
[02:05:30]  It was the minute before she had to get down  And she was standing there blindfolded and naked  It just was so wrong man  Just naked awful  And just a droopy 50 year old woman  With a fucking blindfold on  And standing there waiting to be abused  It just was  It just fuck with me  I was just like  God you know  Come on  You know we were playing  I had to make a deal with Jesus  Look look  You know  Come on  It's like  It's just the show 
[02:06:00]  Right when you walk out of here  You just have to leave everything behind  I ran out of here  Yeah  I didn't even wait for the elevator  I slid down the shaft  I walked on  I walked back to Jersey  I walk home in shame  A lot of days  A lot of days  Walk right through the Lincoln Tunnel  People beeping  Go ahead man  Go ahead  I made the Daily News  Too  Oh yeah  You know  Where is the Daily News article  We had a huge feature  In the paper yesterday 
[02:06:30]  The New York Daily News  A huge feature  And they mentioned  Starker Patty's little stunt  Do we have a copy of that  We can get real fast  You cashed the checks Patty  Yeah my landlord's got them now  Your landlord  You gave it right to him  Right you just gave him a check  Signed him over to him  Right  Yeah  And what does that buy you  I don't even enjoy it  Peace  No I mean  How long before you're in trouble again  No  No trouble at all  So your landlord said  Alright  Everything's cool  You can hang out  Yep  Everything is fine 
[02:07:00]  Alright  Alright yeah  Patty made the article  Here it is  From the Daily News yesterday  The Opie and Anthony  Not so dirty little secret article  It says  Their XM show  Still has a naughty boy element  This week they brought  Their old friend  Starker Patty  Into the studio  And had her crawl around the floor  Naked and blindfolded  To find two $1,000 checks  The floor was also covered  With mousetraps  When Patty caught a finger  In one of them  And yelped  Anthony said  If you were a mouse  You'd be dead  Keep crawling  But I didn't  That was Billy Burr 
[02:07:30]  That was Bill Burr's line  Where is Bill?  Bill's around here somewhere  I got credit for Billy's  Funny line  Did they say  A bad boy element?  Yeah  Did they just explain  Like a bad boy element  Is  A naughty boy element  Is tickling someone  With no feet  Or something  That's naughty  But to  A 50-year-old woman  Crawling around  With mousetraps  Snapping on her  Is that  A naughty element?  Yeah  Hey you see my quote  In the paper?  Oh I'm so psyched  You got credit for that  You didn't like that line? 
[02:08:00]  That was a great line  That was funny  When I saw the video  Of that  When I ran into her today  It's a little better  When I ran into Patty today  And I saw her  I felt like the frat boy  Date rapist  Like the next morning  Like  Hey  That was fun right?  You had a good time?  Everything was good right?  Fucking awful  You guys can have  All the credit  You want for that  I kept calling  Are you cool?  Yeah you're cool with this  You're cool man  You're going to end up  In quarter  That was one of those bits 
[02:08:30]  People started giving me advice  Like maybe you don't want  To do that show  Oh really?  That was the one?  Oh yeah  Then I had to remind them  Like  I did that skit  Dudes Night Out  On Chappelle's show  Yeah like that thing ended  Someone puked on me  And I was jumping up and down  With transvestites  I don't exactly have  The body of work  To walk away from the show  Oh man  Don't let your people influence you  It has wrecked  So many comedians  And I got no advice  Not to show up  Yeah  Patrice  They're encouraging you  I don't think you should do that  Patrice  Why don't you just 
[02:09:00]  Good for you  Good for you  Do anything  You're waking up early  That's a good start  To adulthood  This is his  Gone with the wind  Bill Burr came up  With a great observation  About that  While we were doing it  We don't do radio anymore  We just do  Opie and Anthony experiments  Oh yeah  Oh and that was  When the curtain comes down  That's the Nazi moment  Like  Now we are going  To experiment  And you try to stay cool  When there's some

[02:10:00]  Yeah  Nah she was naked  We don't want to go see  No serious ass  Bill Burr  Who cares about people  Who gives a shit  About some old  Mousetrapped up old bitch  And a  And a big chest  Little motherfucker  We want some meanness  Man  Too good  Humanity  Fuck this humanity  Yeah  Bill's got this conscience  That comes in  After the fact  You're the guy  No I start out  I always start out  And I tap out  And I just get warned  I'm a weak person man 
[02:10:30]  You get pulled right into it  I go with the group  I'm very influenced  You would be one of those guys  At the Nuremberg trials  Like  Hey at first I  You know  I got caught up  In the whole thing  I was following orders  I was just following orders  Did you see  The blinds came down  And I was given my orders  And I was a good soldier  I let them in  But I did not push any buttons  If it helps at all  I did feel bad  Y'all are pieces of shit  Did you see the video  Of the guy with the scrotum?

[02:21:00]  Is that, you know  In the 1980s  Comedy was just gigantic  You know, if you were a comic  You're like  Then they're a rock star  back back in the day it went through this really slow period during the 1990s but all that has  done is it has made the comics better and it's made the audiences actually really want to go  see them you know what i mean yeah yeah that's that's uh that's that's what i think is uh i mean  you've been doing you've been doing comedy for how long now 22 years for 22 years and you obviously  have been you know when it was at its height in the 1980s and you've obviously been the 
[02:21:30]  kind of slow down period during the 90s and how does that uh how does that play out today i mean  are you finding that the that the audiences that are coming to see it are really really cool  interactive audiences that really want to see a comedy show you know it's just big it's hard to  uh comedy now like in the 80s like you said i was just starting i guess so that was working i was  real busy i kept working through all of you say he just started in the 80s i guess people that come  out now the 1880s exactly or you're a draw right now that they recognize you you get more of that

[02:33:00]  you  aaaah  aaaah  aaaah  oh that was anthony  i would  be in the uh... post tomorrow  my post  alright uh... what's your deal  i was born with epidermal nevus syndrome which is  a skin disease  Oh, boys.  Uh-oh.  He's just roving.  No, no, I'm not going to say.  No, you're going to.  He's got a little Rodney Dangerfield, too.  Hey.  What, hey?  You know, my Dr. Vinnie Boobas told me I have epidural.  You can see the back of my neck.  I have, like, brownish, like, bumps back there. 
[02:33:30]  And when I was born, it was all on the left side of my face.  Well, thank God that one.  So they kind of straightened that out?  And when I was 19, I had surgery.  You had surgery at 19?  Yeah, 19 years old, which is about seven years ago.  And they took all the spots or whatever it was?  What they did was I had surgery on my back first.  They cut open my back.  They always want to do that.  Let's cut his back open.  I don't know.  We'll take some chips from his hip. 
[02:34:00]  Let's take a look around.  Let's poke around in there.  A little exploratory surgery.  And they put in, like, balloons, like medical balloons or something.  Wow.  And every week I had to go into the hospital.  You dressed like a hardy boy.  They would inject, like, air into the balloon.  Into the balloon.  They would stretch and stretch.  And what was this supposed to do, straighten out your spine?  No, no, no, no.  And then after, like, four months.  It was just fun.  Just fun for the doctors.  Dude, he's coming in. 
[02:34:30]  You want to watch?  We're going to pump him up to, like, 90 PSI today.  He's just an old fraternity guy.  Balloon, Bokai might do the balloon dance.  Stopping at the gas station.  Ding.  Here he is at the gas station when it's back.  Check his pressure.  Oh, wow.  That's the craziest thing.  So then after, like.  What was that for?  Oh, after.  Oh, you're getting to it.  Okay.  After four months, they took the balloons out, and I had, like, a lot of extra skin on 
[02:35:00]  my back.  Uh-huh.  So they made a.  Oh, they were able to take extra skin.  Kind of make it stretch your skin out.  Yeah, exactly.  So they inflated your spine to.  Doctors.  To stretch out your back.  It had nothing.  It had nothing to do with my back.  It's just.  Yeah, it's just where they got the skin.  And where's that skin now?  Now that skin is on your face?  That skin is on my face.  Which one?  Which one?  Which side?  Which side?  Which side?  Which side?  Which side?  It's the right side.  Which side?  Back face? 
[02:35:30]  Two-tongue.  Come on, spinal chin.  Which side?  You fucking ass.  Hey, uh.  Shoulder blade cheek.  You are already.  By the way, I want to enter the cameraman into the American Mesh competition, because  he's got to have something wrong with him.  He's filming the good side of his face.  Anyone else notice this?  Well, yeah.  You might want to move over to the other side.  That's where the mess is.  Well, I must say.  I'm a Mariah Carey writer.  Yeah, my bad half.  They must have really, uh, that must have really been some bad stuff going on, to go 
[02:36:00]  through that extreme.  That's almost like a face transplant.  Yeah, pretty much.  Wow.  Yeah.  Are you a virgin?  Am I what?  Virgin.  Yeah.  Shit.  Now, are you above hookers like the other motherfuckers?  Am I above them?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Have you ever ordered a hooker?  And, uh, obviously nothing happened.  Yeah, right, Bill.  Yeah, you got it.  The hooker got there.  The hooker's like, you know what?  I forgot.  I'm wearing the wrong pumps.  I forgot.  You know what?  Oh.  I forgot I'm not a hooker. 
[02:36:30]  Wait.  Well, kiss my ass, bitch.  Well, bring your face over, sweetie.  Mwah.  Oh.  You are the worst.  What the fucking book has said?  Kevin, are you hearing all this?  Oh, that's right.  I can hear half this stuff.  I can hear it.  So, what was the initial thing?  Is it considered some kind of, uh, uh, growth, tumor?  Uh, what, what is it?  Skin disorder? 
[02:37:00]  It was a skin disorder.  I, there were a lot of problems with me when I was born.  And, and what is this, genetics?  I also get tumors on the left side of my face.  But, um, fortunately I'm not homeless, so I can get them removed.  So you have, like, insurance?  Oh, you saw half a Hulk face out there?  Yeah, he's out there.  What do you think of half a Hulk face?  What's that?  What do you think of half a Hulk face?  Uh, they'd have to put a blimp in his back to fix that shit.  I mean.  Let's bring in half a Hulk face. 
[02:37:30]  This guy's personality, I think his face matches half a Hulk face.  Uh-huh.  And it's, and it's, it's gruesomeness, but his personality is far more comfortable than half a Hulk face.  Yeah, this is like, you know what, I'm sure, half a Hulk face.  Wait, with a new, with a new shade.  Half a Hulk, half a Hulk face got a haircut.  Got a haircut, shit.  Sean Cassidy.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Which uncovers more of his face, uh.  Half a Hulk face.  It looks like, I should have done that.  That's pretty smart.  Shave and a haircut.  Half face. 
[02:38:00]  What's up?  What's up?  How are you?  Did you guys meet?  No.  That's Kevin.  I've heard about the radio, though.  How are you doing?  If they saw us on the subway platform, it'd be like that, that Dudley Moore and Bo Derek just  running towards each other.  Now, if you pass each other, are you obligated to wave like bus drivers do to each other?  Yeah, kind of like when you see someone with the same car, you're going to be like, lunch buggy.  Hey, man, what's up?  Fat people do it.  Yeah, I know.  I'm on my way, too. 
[02:38:30]  Hey, I'm jogging, too.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, you know.  I'm wearing an iPod.  Right.  Let's acknowledge each other.  We still have, we both have iPods.  It's just like a fucking nonchalant point.  Yeah.  Me, too.  Whatever.  Same sports team hat.  Yeah.  Great game, huh?  See them last night?  Yeah.  You guys got similar things going on.  You notice that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's some kind of a, but you were able to get it taken care of. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  For the most part.  Yeah.  Some part.  These teeth.  It depends who you ask.  What, the teeth are?  Oh!  Oh!  He just pulled half his teeth out of his head.  Half his teeth and half his gums.  And a bucket of saliva.  That was something.  Half a whole face is even bothered by that.  Half a whole face.  That bothered you, right?  A little.  Yeah.  Half a whole face. 
[02:39:30]  How much tobacco is in his cheek?  He looks like Kirk Gibson.  He's the eye night after the World Series in 84.  Half a whole face does not fuck around, man.  You gotta love him.  He's not playing your games with you.  No, I like him.  I like him for that.  He does not play your games.  Kevin, that's pretty disturbing.  I know.  Someone wants to name you right now.  It's Brandy in Wisconsin.  Brandy!  Yeah.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey, I thought it was amazing that we had half a whole face meeting, half a back face. 
[02:40:00]  Half a back face.  Half a back face.  Back face.  Hmm.  Back face.  So that's the skin from your back on that side of the face.  How much of it?  Like from the forehead all the way to the chin?  No, from here.  From the cheekbone?  About even on my nose to like the bottom of my neck.  Oh, to the bottom of your neck.  Like, wow.  Dude, they could like, that's like face off.  Yeah.  And the back skin is gorgeous.  It's very nice.  They ought to just do it to the other side. 
[02:40:30]  Very soon.  Hey, and you're blind in one eye too?  You have a glass eye?  It's a glass eye.  Which one?  Which one?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I guess the left one, your left, which would be the viewer's right.  But, yeah, that kind of, because the eyelid hangs a little bit, and I say a little bit, I mean a huge amount.  Not like that guy from Radiohead.  No, no.  Jesus, man.  It's not like, they don't call that, what do they call it when it's on, like a hot chick? 
[02:41:00]  They call it slow-eyed, the slow-eyed beauty.  Lazy eye?  No, that's about it.  I would have had him put my whole, because the back skin is gorgeous.  It's a beautiful.  It's smooth and youthful.  I would say put the whole face back, baby.  Yeah, I don't think insurance covers that.  Back it up, nigga.  Shit, I got a pimple.  Put some.  Just keep slopping it on.  How about some of my hamstring?  Put that on my neck. 
[02:41:30]  So the glass eye, do you pop that out, or is that permanent?  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  Would you like to do that for us?  Would you stop egging him on?  Oh, no, I'm not watching.  Okay, make sure we get this on video.  Would you like me to do that?  Yeah, why not?  Is it dangerous, though?  It's not dangerous anything, is it?  No, there's no germs in here.  Go ahead, go for it.  No, I'm saying, it's not dangerous to pull your fucking eye out just for a little.  No, no.  For the show, I can't, my karma can't take too much if the guy gets it.  Pull out all your body parts.  Take your teeth out first.  Lay it on the counter there. 
[02:42:00]  It falls out when I sleep sometimes.  What?  Your eyes?  You wake up and your eye is like stuck to your ass.  How long does it take you to realize it?  You wake up, your eye is looking at you from the floor.  You get extra weird looks that day.  You're like, what the fuck?  And then you come home looking down.  What is it?  Oh, shit.  When I was younger, sometimes I would have to miss school because I would wake up and I was gone.  Can't go to school without a eye.  Can we move the webcam closer even?  We're getting requests for this. 
[02:42:30]  Can I tell you something?  He just told one of the saddest stories I've ever heard.  Yeah.  What?  Didn't you just hear that?  I used to fucking, sometimes I couldn't go to school because I'd wake up and my eye had fallen out.  And his eye fell out.  And I couldn't do my Sammy Davis Jr. unimpressive.  Who can make the sun rise?  Backy face can.  All right.  What we need is for him to kind of go where Patrice pulling out his eye. 
[02:43:00]  And his shoulder blade.  Yeah, we kind of need him where you are over there.  If he could step over there, we'll get a better view on the camera.  Backy face.  What balloon can stretch out my back until it makes my whole face turn blue?  A backy face.  A backy face can.  A backy face can.  All right.  Move up to the console a little more.  We found a name for him.  Backy face.  And kind of look into that orb that's on the console there. 
[02:43:30]  Great improv, Anthony.  Those are all great lines.  Bro, you're going to want to move all the way.  No, no.  You guys move that way.  Let the camera guy get in.  No problem.  This is going to be some good video later.  I'll put my hat here just in case something rolls down.  Over the slips.  Over the slips.  All right.  Kevin, let's see you take out your teeth and your eye.  Here come the teeth.  Lower that mic.  Lower that mic.  Boom.  Lower that mic.  Boom.  It's too much, man.  Okay.  There go the teeth.  There go the teeth. 
[02:44:00]  The teeth are too much.  That's the rated G part of this.  Here comes NC-17.  Wow.  All right.  Here we go, kid.  Yeah, here we go.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He just popped his eye out.  What the fuck is going on?  I can't.  Oh, he looks like that.  He looks like that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He looks like the Mike Myers mask in Halloween. 
[02:44:30]  Let's have a pipe.  Actually, that's very good.  Wow.  Can you open up your eye for the camera?  Oh, man.  Open up your eye for the camera.  It's fucking funny, isn't it?  Wow.  So you could actually school fuck you, couldn't you?  Let's go to Nick in Colorado.  We're trying to come up with a name for him.  Nick, how do you say that in England?  School fucking something.  No, it's just straight up.  Nick.  Hey. 
[02:45:00]  What's up?  Good fucking school.  This guy's name should be fucking Mr. Potato Head.  Mr. Potato Head?  Yeah.  That is kind of funny.  You can put the teeth in the eye.  Mr. Potato Head.  Does it look like a real eye?  It's a glass eye.  Wow.  That's amazing.  I would always think it would be round.  But if that was like a car that wouldn't be like the Z28, that would be the Camaro Sport Coupe.  Of eyes.  Of eyes, right.  It's not your top of the line eye, right? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  No air conditioning, no pupil.  It ain't no motherfucker from Last Action Hero, I'll tell you that.  Let's go to Jacob in Louisiana.  Jacob.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  If they made a movie about these guys, would it be called Backface Mountain?  All right.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wait.  Here's his name.  Backdraft?  Here's his fucking name.  All right.  Backface Boy.  Backface Boy?  Backface Boy. 
[02:46:00]  Backface Boy.  Backface Boy.  Oh, said it Backstreet?  Backface Boy.  Kevin, you got anything else you could do for us?  Could you put the eye back in?  Kind of like making it hard for me to keep my eye open.  That's how you do it.  Wow.  Think about the list.  It's hard to do it without a mirror.  Without a mirror?  A mirror.  Yeah, get him a mirror.  The mirror is right.  Oh, my God.  I got it.  Get him a mirror. 
[02:46:30]  Somebody get him a mirror.  Somebody help him.  You can't even help the guy, can you?  And there go the teeth.  The teeth are back in.  Tremendous.  I think that eye's upside down.  Hey, can we see?  Can we see?  You know what you're going to say?  What are those fucking lizards with the horn toad?  Horn toad.  Now, the gecko.  Gecko, gecko.  Now, the fucking things that they can move their eyes independently.  Chameleon?  Thank God there's no mousetraps here.  Can we see where you got your face from?  Maybe lift up your shirt?  Yeah.  Everyone is very curious to see where you got your face. 
[02:47:00]  Wow, your spine is kind of a wreck, too, huh?  Scoliosis, baby.  Scoliosis?  Yeah, I like how he's sporting Opie's look here, though.  The T-shirt over the...  He is dressed just like Opie.  Wait a minute.  I think we got some here.  Let's see who has the worst back.  I have scoliosis, too, so...  You do.  Scoliosis, most...  Scoliosis, I've got of a wreck.  You can't pull your spine out or nothing, right?  Other than that's all connected.  Let's see what we got going on here. 
[02:47:30]  It's Kevin.  What's his name again?  It's Bizarro Opie.  Funhouse Opie.  He's a proper clean gun.  Oh, wait.  Back up.  We've got to get that on camera.  Back up.  Move toward the door.  That is one of those photos from, like, a 50s medical book.  It looks like something...  Yeah.  X-Files.  Raph.  Bring out your dead.  X-Files.  X-Files.  Bring out your dead.  I think it's safe to say you're a virgin as well, correct?  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  Dude, what's with the hunchback thing?  On one side.  On one side, the hunchback.  That's scoliosis.  That's scoliosis.  Yeah.  So your spine is pushing that all up?  My spine is like...  It's kind of curving into the...  And then what's with the front rib?  It's on the tils.  That's because my torso is like...  It's so bent.  That's his collarbone.  My rib.  That's your rib?  See your rib in your...  And you know what?  I used to skip in school.  I used to skip the scoliosis. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, the test.  See what happens?  I suck my dick, and then I could have ended up being...  Yeah.  You know, fucking...  What's the scar in the...  What's the scar in the front?  You got shot.  He's pregnant.  When I was a baby, I had something wrong with my kidneys.  Holy shit.  I'm not really sure of the details because I was a baby.  Why did they go in the front for kidneys?  Oh, poor guy.  I'm really not sure.  You're not sure?  You have a scar from a major operation, and that's...  You're just not sure about what that was.  You know what?  I'm not trying to be funny, but like, when you talk to God, what do you say?  Do you just like, why all of this? 
[02:49:00]  Why what?  Why all of this?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you ever question why you were burdened with this...  Because you got dealt like a royal flush.  I did for a long time.  Not anymore.  That's the seven-deuce-off suit in Hold'em.  He was dealt the seven-deuce-off.  Wow.  For a long time.  He's still got a great personality.  He's got a sense of humor.  You know what?  I've got to commend this guy.  He's very stylish.  He's very, very stylish.  He has the model look with the old navy...  Old navy underwear. 
[02:49:30]  Smooth mother-slam.  So he's...  A little Mark Wahlberg going on there?  Right.  A little Mark Wahlberg.  Marky Mark.  Sorry.  Kevin, I have a question.  Do you have any talents?  Do you like to sing or anything?  Do you have anything like that?  Do you have any talents?  Do you play any instruments like to sing or anything like that?  Oh, my God.  The Tourette guy gives you shit?  Yeah.  Oh, he always does.  No.  I have no talent at all.  What do you do for fun, hobbies, anything like that?  What do you do to bide the time until...  I like to listen to the radio.  You listen to the radio?  Is that it?  I like to... 
[02:50:00]  Crying and breathing.  So, boating, I guess?  I don't know.  Just breathing and crying.  Boating?  Boating?  Boating, drinking with my friends.  What, boating, you said?  Oh, okay.  Boating, yeah.  I go out to bars on the weekends.  Yeah, horseback riding.  I mean, I've been a pretty normal life considering that.  Horseback riding.  Just whatever.  I got you.  Horrifying people just for fun.  How many beers does it take for a chick to think you're hot?  Oh, my God.  He's got a new personality.  She would have to live in beer.  They'd have to drown her in the keg like a witch in Salem. 
[02:50:30]  Like a mermaid.  Is she hot yet?  Is she hot yet?  No!  A beer mermaid.  The guy understands it would be hard to get girls just based on appearance.  You probably got to spin a little bit of the personality, right?  I try.  Yeah.  You got a good sense of humor.  You fucking hoes out there.  Listen, man.  If it's all about personality, I don't care.  Yeah, where's Tyra Banks now?  Come on, we need fucking backface until we figure his name out. 
[02:51:00]  And Neo, man, ante up some pussy, man.  Ante up some pussy.  Let's see who can get these guys laid or something like that.  How about you?  You fucking self?  How about you, dude?  How about you, fucking Porky Pig DeMoto?  Yeah, but I'm actually not a virgin, and that's the honest truth.  Well, that's no treat for a chick, though, when you're going down on her, and your neck 
[02:51:30]  is spinning around like the exorcist.  No, it is a treat.  A head tip.  Why do you get my neck cropped all the time?  Wow.  He makes the um-coming face when he's just standing out.  Oh, my God.  Someone on Instant Feedback has a name for Kevin, is it?  Yeah.  That guy's name should be Scoliope.  Scoliope!  Wow.  Holy shit.  Oh, jeez.  Scoliope.  Who's voting on that?  Yeah, I'm going on for Scoliope.  I'm in for Scoliope.  That's Ian Rice from Long Island. 
[02:52:00]  That is brilliant.  Scoliope.  Damn, I was this bastard.  I'm fucking jealous of that.  Wow.  Scoliope.  That's some good writing right there.  All right, let's hear it for Kevin.  Kevin, amazing.  Kevin, fantastic.  Are you able to fly?  And a good guy, too.  You have friends and stuff?  I lead a normal life.  I mean, yeah, I'm not normal.  And you have friends and stuff?  Oh, you have a Hulk face is laughing at that comment.  Oh, boy.  How tall are you?  5'4". 
[02:52:30]  5'4".  About?  I keep shrinking because the Scoliope varies.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Wow, you keep shrinking?  He used to be 6'2".  Do you have to buy new jeans every year?  No, no.  See, no way they could hammer that spine out or something?  I asked my doctor that.  He said no.  It's too bad.  It got too bad.  It got too bad.  What happened when you were a kid?  Couldn't they fix it then?  Put you in a vice or something when you were a baby?  I don't know.  Anything, a brace?  I got to ask some questions now about your young personal life. 
[02:53:00]  What happened?  So you're born.  What were your parents like?  They're just normal suburban parents.  I mean, my dad had a good job and put a lot of money, I guess.  Yeah.  Do you still send her Mother's Day cards?  I still live with my parents.  Do you still live with your parents?  Was it a genetic thing?  I should have got a lot.  No, because the rest of your family is fine.  This is something that just pops up like a lotto, and you happen to get it. 
[02:53:30]  When he was born, did the doctor go, all right, ma'am, ta-da.  Did he pull a handkerchief off you?  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  That's just right.  That is wrong.  He had a dove.  Separating rings.  This is a lie.  Did this happen, like, right away? 
[02:54:00]  Was it right out of the womb, or was there some indication years later that this was coming on?  I came out with weird skin on the left side of my face.  Weird skin just on the left side of your face.  That right hole that you saw when I took my eye out?  Yeah.  Oh, you didn't have an eye when you were born?  No.  Oh, I thought maybe they had to remove it because of a tumor or something.  So you didn't have an eye.  That's right.  It came out.  It came out.  You came out. 
[02:54:30]  And there was obviously a problem.  Did I ever discuss it with your mom, like what happened in the delivery room when that happened?  I don't like to talk about it.  Yeah, I wouldn't either.  Yeah.  All right.  That's what I was doing.  All right.  I was trying to see how far you would go with that.  All I have to do is fucking, like, exercise, and I'll be okay.  It's like, and I won't even do that.  It's like, this guy can't do shit.  But he does.  But he leads, you know, a normal life.  No, I mean, just like to get better.  Yeah.  Yeah, he can't do anything.  Well, that's why whenever we get into the argument of, you know, the alcoholic, a drug, it's a disease, and we got, no, stop it, shut up. 
[02:55:00]  That's a disease.  I'd like to see this guy decide one day he's going to quit having pretzel backs.  Yeah.  I'm going to stop having a back like a question mark.  All you got to do to kill that is think, exclamation point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I've been slinky-back free for four months. 
[02:55:30]  Give him a round of applause.  All right.  All right, man.  Let's thank Kevin for stopping by.  Kevin, bravo.  You're a great sport.  Good sport, man.  American mess.  You can re-robe, as they say, and you are a contender.  He's got the hand pocket.  He's got the look.  He's got the stance.  He knows how to carry himself.  That son of a bitch has more confidence than I do.  I know.  And that ain't even a lie.  Yeah, you got to write one of those self-esteem books.  Bill got scoliosis just from his dignity. 
[02:56:00]  Just hunch over.  Straighten up, Bill.  I can't.  Yes, you can.  All right.  All right.  Straighten up.  Well, wow.  Before we take a break, we've got another newscast for Big A and Twitchells.  Oh, great.  We're doing two today.  Kevin, you rock.  Twitchells is dressed like Joe Timberlake.  Scoliope.  Wow, that didn't take long.  There is a new member in the PalTalk room, Scoliope.  Welcome.  Scoliope. 
[02:56:30]  They come up with these names quickly.  Oh, my God.  Rev from Wackbag.  Yeah.  Just call him.  Ta-da.  That.  You son of a bitch.  That's so funny.  Ta-da.  He did the magician's dance.  Hey, rock.  Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat.  That trick never works.  Does it smell that ice smells?  They put, you know, they had those silver, like, glittery curtains right around his mom's vagina.  Wow.  Sorry.  Nuts. 
[02:57:00]  That's good.  We have anyone else out there that wants to come in and show off their stuff?  Well, I see Pat from Unnocky was out there.  I don't know why.  There's some of the old favorites right here.  We have the calls here.  Yeah.  So, him out there.  Patty, of course.  We're looking for new people, though.  There are some staples out there.  We'll do this next Friday.  We'll do another open call next Friday.  Oh, yeah.  So, I think it's off to a great start, this American mess.  Great start.  All right.  With the news, once again, let's hear it for Twitchels and Big A.  We'll be sitting there the whole show.

It's because, you know, like I said, when I have repetition of a certain word, like  apparently I must have been using the B word a lot because now, not B, like any word that  starts with a B. And now my OCD is like, it's registering whenever I say a B. It's almost

[03:12:30]  that whole we would love to call him out if he was faking but i just don't see it  people have brought that up on some of the fan sites i just don't see it  and i can't pick no way i'll tell you right now the reason why i'm doing this  because i want to spread awareness and making fun of it is just one of the i  would do that in high school when kids make fun of me i would try to get to the  punchline before they could and it kind of you know trust me i would not want to  fake this especially in high school it's not a fun disorder man wait a minute  i'm not saying you're fake i'm just saying is it is it you're hamming it up is it  not is it fucking physically possible for him to fake it but i don't think it is 
[03:13:00]  i've never spotted him faking it i don't know because when no one's paying  attention with you but i will tell you this call caffeine nerves it does add to  it there's days where you would not see me twitch once but when i come here i  mean usually it's at the minimum i have is four cups of coffee before i get in  here and it just i'm so excited to be here it hypes me up but no i never think  only i can i say one thing the only time i did fake it was during class when a  friend of mine was getting yelled at by my teacher and take the attention off of 
[03:13:30]  him i had i started doing it just so you know to help him out that's the only time  i've done it why don't you fucking twitch your way out of that eighties comic  jacket you guys you fucking have no i love this jacket that jacket is awful it makes me  fucking sick twitchels what are we promoting today uh he's taping stand-up spotlight this  weekend with rosie o'donnell night of the improv okay um i'm going to be at chiller

[03:14:30]  uh... bitching because the show has turned into us just talking for an hour at a time hour and a half  and when you record the show it makes it a real pain in the ass to try to navigate the show  yeah it's not segmented so you got to go through a whole lot an hour and a half a show in order to  get to something you might want to hear one part of the hour and a play something for a friend  something like so just notice we're working on the pad data and uh... breaking up the segment so you can  navigate around if you're taking the show okay anything uh... you could type in anything in  there who has control over it uh... derrick derrick does yeah so he can type like just off the top of 
[03:15:00]  my head he rocks a dick on there and uh... yeah we'll start fucking around and then really having  fun with the pad data he gets so disappointed photos of neo and scoliope are online for your viewing  pleasure at opie and anthony dot com wow wow wow god is that the best name someone's pointing  oh uh... what i don't have it on mine  it takes a few seconds to update all right here he rocks a dick here i think it's now 
[03:15:30]  i had a day to say so it can be done all right on say okay so we'll be having some  fun with the pad data and making it that  making it easier for you guys to navigate show if you tape it  and no this isn't what uh... elo was on the air  talking to us about  that everyone is speculating about  the big surprise that elo was talking about  oh yeah yeah yeah  yeah no this isn't it  no no no  pad data  jesus  all right derrick get us out of here  that's their idea of paradise 
[03:16:00]  that's like beauty  make a room uh... feel bigger painting fans on the wall make it seem cooler cooler in malaysia  malaysia we're looking at uh... uh... uh... uh... blitney yeah blitney blitney spears  the uh... malaysian girl that's on uh... uh... pal talk that patrice is just infatuated  oh my god she's gorgeous too  and i got just got her to stand up to see the rest of her body

[03:17:00]  that's not  lesia  uh... gotta love that pal talk delicious  uh... we didn't even talk to pat from monarchy we got no filter paul here  we got a guy that sweats on only half his face  that's an odd little thing  remember that i do like jumping jackson here so we can see it  watch him sweat we did do that uh... to him uh...  he was on our any w show  yeah  and we made him exercise  and eat uh... we made him eat hot sauce and hot peppers  and he just started sweating out of half his face and half his face turned red 
[03:17:30]  it's the sickest thing  unbelievable  it's unbelievable is right  but after you get someone like half a hulk face  and uh... scoliope  look at half a hulk face he came in  and uh... kirk kept he came in and and and and and and and looked and  here and look down on the sheet he just came in to have a hulk and just  just what though  i will not be a part of this  yeah i remember this guy and no filter paul wants to know if we're doing anything  with him today  he just showed up frustrated  he's getting frustrated  his wife is sleep  no  he took a day off from work we're not doing a man cow look-alike contest today 
[03:18:00]  uh...  uh...  jesus you know look around you you think you're on next  uh...  you're the guy they're bumping from letterman  because bob hope came on carson  we like to apologize  you're the author  that didn't get on  sometimes  you know he's very funny  you know you're what's called the reschedule  could you get a hope and uh... dean martin off please  that's our show and our apologies to no filter paul  right  we're gonna get you on next time  i remember that everybody 
[03:18:30]  yeah  what's your name again  he  what  he  he  he  yes  like the candy bar  exactly  right  exactly  is that mike gone even  yeah he's gotta get close to it though  it's not one of these mics you know  you gotta get right on it  like a rock star  he's ledger  use that one that's even better  so explain to these guys  they've never seen it  anthony and i have seen this  yeah  okay basically i got into a motorcycle accident  the nerves got all banged up  and  anytime i eat doesn't really matter what i eat  i sweat  on this side of my face  on the right side of my face 
[03:19:00]  that's from a motorcycle accident  yeah  what did you hit  like a car hit me on the side  and then what banged your head  uh... yeah broke the jaw  oh  and destroyed his sweat glands  so that must have been  uh oh he's pulling his pants down  what the hell is that  scars  no i see the scar but like there's a muscle there that  that's like it doesn't quite belong  it's an overdeveloped  quad sex  and that comes up on both sides over here  jeez  wow they put your leg back together basically  over here 
[03:19:30]  you were rebuilt  on a normal time that would be bad  gotta love those motorcycles  yeah  wow  yeah is this guy a model  yeah  yeah that's a bit  are you like gary busey i mean do you still ride with like  no helmet  gave up the ride  yeah  he's got like a fucking used hummer now  you gotta be  yeah  you gotta be crazy to ride a motorcycle  the fucking right side  why he's riding and eating the right side of people's windshields and getting wet  what's going on 
[03:20:00]  that's weird  that's weird a doctor tell you that it was dangerous or anything  no they just said more or less it was probably some kind of nerve damage because if i do anything physical  you know running around or any kind of working out which rarely happens but it'll be the other side of my face that'll sweat  what did you do the first time you noticed that like hey  what's going on here  i was freaked out  i had no idea and i went back to the doctor and he's like yeah don't worry about it  so whenever you eat  yeah pretty much  you eat anything you'll sweat 
[03:20:30]  like that's odd  forget about half the face or anything  just sweating while you eat  yeah  unless you know you're shoveling it in  how hilarious is that the doctor  yeah don't worry about it  that means you know what i can't fix that  and i have no idea what it is  that's not any of my books  yeah how about basic uh basic heat basic sunshine basic 90 degree weather  how about july how do you do in july  you're in a malaysian apartment  how would you sweat  it'll be the left side 
[03:21:00]  just paint  so wait  one side when you're hot sweats  yep  the other side when you eat  yeah  so you ever been on a date with a hot girl and you want to seem normal  guys  hot outside  so you start eating a pepper  screw all that here comes the pizza  let's turn the thermostat  there comes the hot pizza  oh here we go  should have known jason kidd was going to come up with something  right  there we go  with the hot spices and everything that'll really do it  good stuff  oh my gosh  bunch of pepper on there 
[03:21:30]  yeah don't forget the condiments there  he's going to shit out of half his ass after he eats that  it's going to be half a solid stool and a liquid mess  get a good one  he sweats really bad too  it's not like a little sweat where you have to kind of try to figure it out  it's the whole entire head  that looks like good pizza  where'd that come from  i was just thinking that shit  right up to a man  pizza is the best fucking thing on the face of the earth  yeah if you're in new york  yeah if you're in new york
