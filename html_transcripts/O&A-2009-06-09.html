<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a description of their chaotic morning commutes, punctuated by a massive lightning storm over Long Island and a large fire in Queens (later identified as a wig factory).  The conversation quickly pivoted to their website, Savethetitmonster.com, dedicated to supporting a young tennis player considering a breast reduction due to her large breasts hindering her career.  This led to a graphic discussion of breast reduction surgery, interspersed with listener calls sharing personal experiences with the procedure. The conversation then veered off into a discussion of websites showcasing botched plastic surgery, notably mentioning Jocelyn Wildenstein.  An update followed on a topless coffee shop that recently burned down, with the owner’s plans to relocate to a tent.

The show then addressed listener calls and reviews of the new iPhone 3GS (lacking MMS at launch),  "The Hangover" (generally praised), and "Paul Blart: Mall Cop" (heavily criticized). This transitioned into a discussion of the financial success of poorly reviewed films, the comedic styles of Adam Sandler and other actors, and the recurring technical difficulties plaguing the show—repeated phone line crashes attributed to another program using their studio the night before.  The show concluded this section with a revisit and critique of the movie "Porky's," focusing on the female characters' appearance.


A subsequent segment began with a vulgar discussion about women's pubic hair, followed by brief reviews of *Easy Money* and *The Hangover*.  The technical difficulties resurfaced, with runtime errors repeatedly crashing the phone lines. This was again attributed to the previous night's studio use. Further movie reviews (negative for *Mall Cop*, positive for *The Hangover*) followed, along with commentary on a Joe Scarborough book cover photo.  A caller, Lydia, engaged in a crude discussion about pubic hair, further fueled by on-screen images.  More technical issues and frustration ensued, briefly interrupted by a humorous audio clip about Anthony's high school. The conversation then shifted to movies (*Bad Santa*, *Sling Blade*) and the death of Kenny Rankin, with a search for his famous song ("On and On").  A trivia fact about Stephen Bishop in *Animal House* was discussed.  Callers Ray (describing a medical emergency) and another discussing David Carradine's death and conspiracy theories were featured, along with more Helen Reddy songs.  The segment ended with a listener's attempt to recreate a previous bit about "drinking from cups" and a call with comedian Bill Burr, discussing YouTube, parenting, and various societal observations.  Opie’s upcoming stand-up shows were then promoted.

Another segment focused on a news story about a Yankees fan planting Yankee Stadium grass seeds at Fenway Park during a Dave Matthews Band concert.  This led to a pun-filled discussion with a caller, Tim from Boston.  A caller, Cindy, then shared a story about her boyfriend wiping his ass on the Green Monster at the same concert.  This sparked a lengthy, vulgar critique of Dave Matthews Band’s music, with comparisons to music appealing to lawyers and dentists.  The discussion then dramatically shifted to Anal Cunt, playing several songs with provocative titles like "I fucked your wife," "I lit your baby on fire," and "Van Full of Retards," eliciting mixed reactions from the hosts and callers.  The show moved on to a similar critique of Sammy Hagar's Chickenfoot, concluding with tangents on brown-nosers and past incidents.  Numerous calls from listeners across various states contributed to the chaotic and often offensive nature of this segment.

A later segment centered on a rambling discussion of Van Halen and other music genres (blues and hip-hop), with strong, vulgar opinions expressed about Sammy Hagar's vocals and various artists like NWA and Eric B & Rakim.  A considerable portion of this segment was dedicated to listener calls and stories about child pornography, presented with darkly comedic and inappropriate commentary from the hosts.  This included detailed discussions of a news story about Jackie Kennedy's half-brother's arrest for possessing child pornography and local news stories involving arrests for child-related crimes (a PE coach and a selectman).  The hosts also discussed David Carradine's unusual sexual practices.  The segment culminated in the graphic description and showing of a video depicting a man's electrocution on a train in India.  The discussion briefly touched upon North Korea's nuclear threats before concluding.

The final segment began with a discussion about electrocution and high voltage, followed by a call from Paul, an Indian immigrant, recounting shooting a Desert Eagle in Las Vegas and listening to the show while hooking up his X-ray machine. A video showing a man electrocuting himself while touching electrified grapes was then played.  The discussion continued with the dangers faced by electricians, including calls from Dave (Amtrak employee) and Ted, detailing injuries and incidents involving high-voltage power lines and trains. Another video showcasing a lineman working on high-tension lines from a helicopter was shown, followed by John clarifying the process of safely discharging the lines. The segment concluded with a rapid-fire, nonsensical sequence of jokes, insults, and unrelated comments about women, firemen, a mysterious video of defecation, and an incoherent rant, ending on a stream of disjointed phrases and references.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Let's!  It's on the road. There it is.  Just got it.  Got on the on-ramp.  Accelerating into traffic.  Oh, there's someone jamming on the brakes in front of us.  Oh, damn it.  Nothing but red lights ahead.  We might as well hang out here and talk a little while.  Opie and Anthony, good morning.  Is it two for Tuesday already? Nice.  Yeah, it is. Already. 
[00:00:30]  We were here one day.  Yeah, but that works, trust me.  Yeah, it really does.  Get that Monday out of the way, kind of.  Yeah, Monday sucks.  It does kind of work.  Monday sucks no matter what you do for a living.  I hear ya.  We're lucky, but it still sucks for even us.  Yeah.  And we got cool jobs.  It's the getting up thing.  It's the getting up thing that sucks.  Last night was one of those nights where that fine lightning wakes you up.  I didn't hear any of that shit. 
[00:01:00]  I think it hits you right around Long Island.  Was it raining when you came in?  Pouring out.  That's why, because it was slowly but surely making its way to Long Island.  Pouring.  All of a sudden you're fast asleep and all of a sudden you're awake and you're like,  why am I awake?  And then, bam!  Oh, that's why I'm awake.  Lightning storms.  All I know is driving in on the, I guess the south side of the Long Island Expressway  in Queens was, it looked like an explosion.  It looked like a mushroom cloud. 
[00:01:30]  Really?  What's that about?  I don't know, but there was a big ass fire cooking somewhere.  Did you see that, Danny?  No.  Was it a car fire?  No, it couldn't have been.  It was too big.  Huh.  Why isn't the news covering it?  I don't know.  I was driving by and I had winds on.  It looked like it just happened, whatever it was.  Queens.  Oh, yeah.  It was a wig factory.  A wig factory?  Yeah, that'll happen.  I smelled burning hair.  Was it Ted's wig emporium and toop, toop and wig emporium? 
[00:02:00]  I had a wig store.  It didn't do well.  The only person I modeled after was Yul Brynner.  I see this ball.  Can you imagine a wig freaking factory going up?  With real hair burning for everybody?  That smell.  What is going on today?  Well, we walked into the studio and we got great news.  Great news.  Savethetitmonster.com is up and running.  Up and running.  Who gives a shit about everything else going on in the world? 
[00:02:30]  We got Savethetitmonster.com.  This is...  I thought it was going to be that a certain person died.  I think we need other pictures of girls that are well endowed on the site, by the way.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, we're trying to save the young tennis player.  She's a phenom, but her big boobies are getting in the way.  But it's all about her.  I know, but you got to just, I don't know, just kind of boost it a little bit. 
[00:03:00]  Keep it about her, though.  Oh, it'll definitely be about her.  But maybe some other women with big boobs.  You say take a site dedicated to one person or one thing, and then just turning it into  something else.  I'm just thinking of a little variety where we get to see more girls with big boobs.  Oh, see, I thought it was something else.  We'll never move away from the reason why we have Savethetitmonster.com.  But she's a terrific tennis player, but her boobs are getting in the way, and now she's 
[00:03:30]  thinking about getting a breast reduction.  Yeah.  That never works, man.  You look like the scarring, and it just looks horrendous.  You ever see a girl that had her boobs done?  I have never seen a boob reduction boobs.  What's the difference between them?  But I'm sure I will in a second.  They got to cut all over the place.  I think it starts with like a cross below the nipple, and then they have to cut on the  sides and move it all together. 
[00:04:00]  It's horrific.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Well, those are awful.  Well, that whole thing is awful.  Yeah.  They don't know really how to make them look really good after they, you know.  Let's see.  There's got to be one good one in there.  Take out some of their meat.  I dated a girl years ago, a really sexy girl, and she had those scars.  Oh, my God.  She had reduction surgery.  Yeah, see.  Really?  Yeah, I didn't know what it was.  She told me she was really self-conscious about her tits, and it was like that little cross  scar.  It went from the nipple under, and it didn't look like a typical breast job, and I think that's 
[00:04:30]  what it was.  It's a massive scar that starts at the nipple and goes downward.  It's got to be something that...  All right, wait a minute.  Look at that one.  Well, not too bad.  That's a little better.  I guess it depends on the doctor.  Yeah.  Wow, those are awful moose noses beforehand.  Jesus.  That's the best description of big boobs ever.  Hey, Danny, so SaveTheTitMonster.com, what do we get?  What do we get for our money if we go there?  Well, you get to sign a petition to try to save the tit monster.  You can read all about her, the site's purpose. 
[00:05:00]  It's got a message to give to all the people.  Of course.  Why wouldn't it?  There's Simona News, and we even embedded that YouTube video.  Very good.  So you can watch her big titties.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  This would get national attention if we didn't call it SaveTheTitMonster.com.  I know.  You're such idiots.  We really are, because it would.  They would pick up on it.  They really would.  But a website, oh, forget it.  Forget it.  They can't even do this story. 
[00:05:30]  It is the smartest idea ever, but they don't know how to name their website.  Who is it?  Opinion.  Oh, all right.  Now it makes sense.  Forget it.  Don't even talk about them.  Leave them alone.  Maybe they'll go away.  We're on a good roll with Breedbart.  But I don't think Breedbart's going to pick up the SaveTheTitMonster.com idea.  I don't think they're going to run with this one.  They already have a problem playing our audio up there.  They have to warn everyone that there's a lot of cursors.  Oh, very graphic, indeed.  But I think a section with other women to look at, somehow subtly.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:06:00]  I have such a problem logging into my email.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  Not in this day and age.  So what do we get?  We get the petition.  We get the news.  We get the, what, like photos?  That's coming.  And the embedded video, like you were saying.  Yeah, like there's going to be pictures.  It's coming.  There's going to be pictures and stuff on that page.  But for now, because it's still under construction.  Okay.  So for now, you get the nice big booby YouTube video.  What about the background just being big-breasted women?  Might be a little noisy. 
[00:06:30]  I know.  There's nothing wrong with noise when you're talking about big boobs.  So do yourself a favor and check out SaveTheTipMonster.com.  Sign the petition, everyone.  Let's save her.  How are we saving her if she really wants this done?  We have to explain to her somehow why she needs to keep her really nice boobs.  Maybe there should be a comment section.  Comments?  Kind of like an old school guest book.  Yes.  Something like that.  Yeah, where you sign it and you're able to, yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Well, like I said, it's a work in progress.  I like it so far.  I love it so far, actually.  Wouldn't.  I'll get on that.  We have Bob in Delaware.  His girlfriend had the breast reduction surgery.  Hey there, Bab.  Bobby.  Yellow.  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  There it is.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I was banging a girl in college that had a breast reduction.  Honestly, it made her a hundred times better looking because pictures of her beforehand, 
[00:07:30]  oh.  Pretty bad.  They were just so huge.  They're just, you know, how do you know this girl, this girl that plays tennis, how do you  know that, you know, they're not sloppy when she takes off her bra?  They could be pretty nasty.  No, there's a few shots when she leans over to do the serve thing and they're barely moving.  She's got youth on her side, my friend.  She's 17 years old.  That's true.  That's true.  I think she should keep playing tennis until she's about 22, 23.  Yeah.  Then maybe some of that gravity will start taking over. 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  I don't know when that happens.  They are wrapped up in that sports bra, too, you've got to remember.  They're pushed nicely to her body.  Oh, my God.  Remember that one shot where it's almost squeezing out the armpit?  Wonderful.  The scars are pretty bad.  Yeah, the scars are bad, but in the end, you were very happy with how your girlfriend  looked, huh?  A lot better, yeah, because I saw pictures of her previous.  I mean, I only met her in college after she had had it done, but I saw pictures of her  beforehand.  Yeah.  And she just looked completely disproportionate. 
[00:08:30]  I mean, yeah, it was really nasty.  Okay.  There you go.  Bob's a fan of the reduction.  So I guess you're not going to SaveTheTitMonster.com, then?  I might.  I don't know.  Well, you're telling me you started that.  I might.  You know, you've got to talk me into it.  I think this is an excuse, like, for the guys out there that can't really, like, you  know, do some porn search in there.  Yeah, they just go there.  Go, look, I'm doing something nice here.  It's a cause, honey. 
[00:09:00]  Come on, dear.  It's a cause.  Hey, maybe that's the deal, Dan.  And we show really bad breast reduction photos.  Sure.  Maybe we can get some of those scarring pictures up there.  See?  Now that's a good idea because it ties in.  That's a great idea.  Say, is this what you want?  Is this what you want?  And if we do that, then it leads to what I really want.  So you show the pictures of the bad scars.  Tocs on there?  No.  When you see the bad scars, then you go, well, I look like this when you could look 
[00:09:30]  like this.  Oh, and then well-endowed girls that are fine.  Yeah.  Like, left side bed, scarred boobs, right side, really nice.  Crazy like a fox.  Let's say hi to Jeff in North Carolina.  Jeff, how are you?  Hi there, Jeff.  Morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Yeah, my wife had the surgery, too.  And for the first couple years, I was like, what the hell did you do to your tits, Ben? 
[00:10:00]  Must have been lovely conversations around your house.  What did you do to your tits?  After about five years, the scarring really goes away.  I mean, I can't even see it anymore.  Does it?  It's worth it.  They look better now.  She went from Bs to As.  She wanted to be flat-chested.  Yeah.  How big were they originally there, Jeff?  She was a 36 double D, and she went down to a 36 C.  36 full C, probably. 
[00:10:30]  That's perfect, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're very nice.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  Yeah, have a good one.  Let's go to Josh.  Josh?  What's up, guys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  No problem.  My wife had it done, my sister had it done, and an ex-girlfriend of mine all had it done.  I don't know about my sister.  What the hell's going on with you?  Yeah, what's the common denominator here, and why?  I don't know.  It sounds weird how a girl I dated and my wife had it done.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you what.  My wife's breasts look phenomenal now. 
[00:11:00]  She had one of the best doctors in the Baltimore area, and I can't stop looking at them.  They look so good.  You would never know she had it done.  How many years ago?  Uh, three.  Oh, see, maybe they...  Maybe she's only 20.  Maybe they figured it out.  Maybe they figured out the surgery, because the last time I saw a breast reduction scar  in person, wow.  Well, she doesn't have that one that comes down to the nipple.  It's just, it's right underneath the breast.  Right.  You would never know, but the doctor did have to remove the nipple to do all that kind of 
[00:11:30]  stuff, but it looks fantastic, and the best part is her doctor's name was Dean Cain,  and he wore a stupid Superman thing on his head.  No, he didn't.  He did not.  He did.  Taking a little too far.  What's going on with the nipple that they can just take it off, put it on the side?  Yeah, it is amazing.  It just hangs out on the side until they're done with the breasts, and then they pop that  thing back on.  Put on like a fucking pop bottle cap.  It's like a manhole cover.  Why isn't it affected after you take it off the body? 
[00:12:00]  You lose sensitivity, I think, if it's not done right.  Yeah, I've heard that.  Let's go to Psycho Bob in Baltimore.  Psycho Bob.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Hey, there's a site that you may want to check.  It's called awfulplasticsurgery.com, and you may find some interesting things there.  Yeah, let's take a look.  I think we've checked out this site over the years, but I haven't been there in a while.  Dan, what do we got on awfulplasticsurgery.com?  Yeah, I've seen this. 
[00:12:30]  They update this pretty regularly.  I've seen some of the probably the worst things on this website, like bad collagen implants.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that Jocelyn Wildenstein is always showing up on this website.  She's a beast, a real monster.  Yeah, you know her if you saw her.  Mike in New York.  What's up, Mike?  Mike?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I want some advice and some help.  Maybe I should go to this website.  My wife has 44 triple Ds, and she's been talking about getting it done because it's killing her back and all that. 
[00:13:00]  But I'm telling her, you know, it's the surgery.  I'm worried about it, you know, because I've heard horror stories about it.  So maybe I should tell her to go on that website and look for herself.  Well, wait, you want her to get the reduction or you don't want her?  Oh, hell no.  I like them the way they are.  What's up with the phones?  Well, you like the big boobies, huh?  Yes, sir.  44 triple D.  That's nice.  Big monsters.  Oh, God.  That divot.  Ugh. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, Tori Spelling has the worst boob job ever.  There's a divot in there.  It's, you're absolutely right.  It is.  It's like someone teed up in her cleavage and took a big divot out.  Mm-hmm.  God damn.  Why would she wear, she should wear turtlenecks.  That shit's horrendous.  We're a football jersey.  Yeah.  That horse face.  Oh, God.  All right, Mike.  So, you don't want her to get the breast reduction thing?  No, sir.  Okay.  Jeff M. from Staten Island.  Why not add a pros and cons photo section to SaveTheTidMonster.com? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, God damn it.  Well, that's a tranny.  What's her name?  She's...  Amanda Lepore.  Yeah, she's in the news from time to time.  Oof.  Oof.  So...  Oh, God.  We're looking at, what, badplasticsurgery.com?  Horribleplasticsurgery, yeah.  Is it called horrible?  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awfulplasticsurgery.com.  Sorry, sorry for getting the name wrong.  Awful.  Awful, horrible, bad. 
[00:14:30]  Speaking of boobies, we'll segue into another update on the coffee shop.  Remember the topless coffee shop?  Of course.  When last we left you, it had had a tragic fire and burned down.  We've been following this place for years.  Yeah, it burned down.  It caused half a million dollars in damage.  And we were thinking Jewish lightning or something, but it turns out the guy had no insurance.  No insurance.  So why would he do that?  Why?  Well, here's the update.  They're relocating to a tent. 
[00:15:00]  This guy will not give up on topless coffee.  He knows.  People love the tits.  They just want them.  The owner of a topless coffee shop destroyed by fire last week said he plans to have clothed  waitresses collect donations in the parking lot to raise money to rebuild.  Under town zoning rules, Donald Crabtree would need a new permit to start operating his business  from a trailer or other structure on the property.  Instead, Crabtree set up a tent. 
[00:15:30]  So they're getting their coffee in a tent right now.  And he has employees...  Oh boy, wild built coffee with tits.  Employees handing out free donuts and coffee next to a collection jar.  He's never going to collect a half million dollars, though.  I mean, you know, guys love their tits, but not to the point where they're going to be able to raise that much money.  So he's trying to stay in business.  Now he's in a tent.  Giving it a whirl, huh?  Yeah.  Good luck to him.  A tent. 
[00:16:00]  It's down to the point where there's a tent and some chicks with tits.  It's like, please, you know.  Who are the girls that are going for this?  Can you imagine?  They've got to be a lower caliber than you'd get in, you know, tit bar.  They're probably not even day strippers.  No, no.  He's got a couple there.  He's working it out.  Manson style.  Yeah.  Got some followers.  Let's say hi to Dan in Virginia.  Dan.  Dan.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Pretty good, man.  All right.  I got a great suggestion from the website. 
[00:16:30]  For the women that are trying to decide whether or not they want the surgery,  they send photos in, and then we vote on whether or not they shouldn't have the surgery.  That takes care of two birds with one stone.  We get pictures up there.  Two birds with one stone.  That lovely saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, good.  People can vote on it, I guess.  Yeah, somehow we've got to get a variety of pictures up there.  Yeah.  But save the tipmonster.com. 
[00:17:00]  Check it out for yourself.  Up and running.  First day.  I mean, it'll develop.  Remember when FattyRock.com started, there was nothing going on on the site.  Now look at it.  And it turned into, like, Google.  Yes.  What else is going on this morning?  Oh, what's up with the new iPhone?  They finally announced what that's all about?  I gather they did.  Did you get one yet?  Well, it's not available.  It comes out in a week or something, right?  Until the 19th, I believe.  Ten days.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  I will be getting one.  A little angry that the photo texting is not going to be available until the end of  the summer.  And that's all AT&T's fault.  That's right.  They fucking stink, dude.  Because they said that there's a problem and they have to go through every account separately  to do so.  I don't even understand it.  They're pretty much the last phone to have video texting, right?  Terrible. 
[00:18:00]  Or picture texting.  I mean, picture texting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Picture texting.  MMS.  You're right.  It's a disgrace.  Isn't pretty much every phone you could do that, right?  Of course you can.  It's a simple thing.  And they're holding that back until the end of the summer.  AT&T is an embarrassment.  They're not even an average carrier.  They are an embarrassingly bad carrier.  I have AT&T.  They're terrible.  I rarely have a problem.  Have you had Verizon?  I have AT&T.  But why would I get Verizon?  I never had a problem with AT&T. 
[00:18:30]  I'm not going to mess with this.  Can you make calls from your apartment?  Sort of.  I can't.  Sort of.  Sort of.  That's a rousing endorsement.  Can you make a call that doesn't get dropped?  You have to get a separate number.  My Verizon.  I got a house phone because of that.  But that's the only place my phone doesn't work.  It's Manhattan.  6th Avenue.  Drive down 6th Avenue.  When I'm driving from the cellar, if I go to the west side highway,  and I'm in the village, there's one area where it always gets dropped.  Verizon never.  That's the only problem I have in my apartment.  But I guess that would be a big problem, huh? 
[00:19:00]  If you have a cell phone.  If you live there, sure.  If you have a cell phone, you can't.  I always have to tell people, call me on the house phone.  I think it's a terrible service.  Shoot video, then edit it right on your iPhone.  That's strong.  Make a call or play a song using voice control.  That's strong.  Search across your iPhone using spotlight search.  That's on various contacts and stuff.  Let compass point you in the right direction.  I guess one of the apps. 
[00:19:30]  A compass?  A compass.  Yeah.  I got one.  I got an app.  I think I have a compass app on mine.  Why would you need a compass?  You wouldn't.  Because sometimes you need to know what direction you're going in.  Just look up.  Look up at the stars.  No, I have a GPS app.  Yeah, well.  Which, by the way, has a compass on it.  Mm-hmm.  On it.  It's got a compass on it.  So, Ant, will you be able to?  There's a feature on the iPhone called Notes.  Take a little notebook you can type your thoughts onto. 
[00:20:00]  And they don't let you sync it up with your home computer.  You can't download your notes.  You should copy notes and then go home and then look at it and retype it on your computer.  They're just too controlling.  They're just too controlling.  See, look.  I got my latitude, my longitude.  Right.  A little compass.  They're already making a shitload of money.  Just put everything out on one phone.  What are you doing?  We missed the joke with the topless.  No.  Say it's not so. 
[00:20:30]  Sean in North Carolina writes, does anyone find the irony that the owner of the topless coffee shop is pitching a tent?  Oh, see.  All right.  That's kind of funny.  So, are you happy or sad with the new iPhone?  Well, of course.  What are you reading so far?  Of course I'm happy.  Introducing iPhone 3GS.  Fastest.  Most powerful iPhone yet.  But the picture touched it.  Video recording.  Voice control.  Up to 32 gigs of storage and more. 
[00:21:00]  Using 3GS.  Quickly launches web pages.  Blah, blah, blah.  Video.  Now you can shoot, edit it, and share it all on your iPhone 3GS.  Shoot high-quality VGA video in portrait or landscape.  Trim your footage by adjusting start and end points.  Then share your video in an email.  Post it to your mobile me gallery.  Of course, Jimmy loves mobile me.  It's horrendous.  Mobile me.  What's wrong with mobile me?  What's wrong with mobile me?  Nothing.  If you're, like, just losing information. 
[00:21:30]  It's so bad.  I had it.  Sometimes all my contacts would just disappear from my phone.  Why did everyone buy the iPhone if it wasn't ready to go?  Because we're dummies.  No, it was good enough.  Good enough to go.  But the...  The pluses outweighed the minuses, and I still think they do.  You know what, though?  I don't know how I would live without picture texting.  It's...  And you still don't picture text.  Picture texting, very important.  So I picture email.  I have to get emails.  I tell people, email me the goddamn picture. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  And I can check the email on my phone, and I get the picture.  If you get around it...  You know what drives me nuts, though?  It's that the positives outweigh the negatives, but the negatives are unnecessary.  Yeah, you're right.  And they're only there because, A, Apple was being greedy, or, B, AT&T was just not a good carrier.  Yeah.  They didn't need to be there.  Can you...  By the way, like you can do with a BlackBerry, can you say...  Can you, like, text video?  I have no idea.  With the new amazing iPhone, you can text video?  Text...  It says, share your video in an email. 
[00:22:30]  It doesn't say text.  Yeah.  Post it to your mobile mute gallery, publish it on YouTube, or sync it back to your Mac  or PC using iTunes.  That's solid.  Learn more about video recording.  No, that's solid.  I got that on the BlackBerry.  That's a good one.  That's solid.  Where you just take a little video, and then you can email it.  Shoot it widescreen.  It's fine.  Widescreen, really?  Share it with anybody.  Tap the camera icon in Messages to record on the fly, and send it to your buddy via MMS.  So you will be able to send video on MMS. 
[00:23:00]  But not picture text?  Well, I'm sure the pictures and video will be at the end of the summer.  What the fuck are they doing?  I don't know!  Just put it all out.  So at the end of the summer, if you want that, is it a free download?  Yeah, I'm sure it'll just be a little upgrade thing that you gotta do.  But there does seem to be a lot of stuff.  Copy-paste, which has been a big issue.  A lot of that.  What do you mean copy-paste?  What are you talking about?  We haven't been able to copy-paste from emails and whatnot. 
[00:23:30]  What?  Yes, very annoying.  Why are they holding back the basic stuff?  I don't know.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve.  Yes.  Is this the O&A show, or is this Consumers Reports for the iPhone?  Consumers Reports?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  This announcement yesterday was kind of big.  And all of us, not all of us, but a lot of us have the iPhone.  We talk about it. 
[00:24:00]  Is there a problem?  He already hung up.  Of course he did.  You were a horrible caller.  Horrible fucking caller.  With a complete lack of understanding of what this show is about.  If Apple announces a new iPhone, we want to talk about it a little bit.  Yeah.  And I have no intention of getting an iPhone, but I still have an interest in it for some  reason.  Because it seems like everybody in the world has one.  Yeah.  Wherever you go.  People are plinking away on that thing.  Plink, plink, plink. 
[00:24:30]  Voice control.  That sounds like an interesting little concept.  What's voice control?  I don't know.  Making a call on an iPhone has always been easy.  With voice control, it's even easier.  Now you can make calls and play music using just the sound of your own voice.  So I guess you just say, hey, play this or call this person.  With that crack audio quality, I'm sure it'll work every time.  Yes.  I'm sure it will.  But you've drank the Kool-Aid, Jimmy.  I see you got an iPhone right on here.  The iPhone seems like you hate it with a vengeance. 
[00:25:00]  But what bothers me is I know I'm going to get rid of it and then it's finally going  to be.  What bothers me is what it could be.  It could be such an amazing thing.  And even Louis CK, Louis is a Mac guy.  Louis loves everything Mac.  He just stopped paying his iPhone bill and went back to his BlackBerry.  It was such a piece of shit.  It's great for certain things and the idea of having it.  But the fact that when you send someone a picture, you have to go to a website called  viewmymessage.com.  That whole thing is ridiculous. 
[00:25:30]  That's amazing to me.  It's almost thievery.  It's so bad.  It never works.  It is crazy.  If someone sends you a picture, you have to go to viewmymessage.com.  Who would do that?  An incompetent, terrible carrier.  There's no need for it.  Half the time when someone just sends you something in a text, you don't even open it  up.  How about this now?  Because you're like, all right.  I know if E-Rock sends me something, there's no reason to click on the picture.  No, it's worthless. 
[00:26:00]  For real.  Yeah, I hear you.  For real.  And he means well, but there are people in your life, when they send you something, you  just know there's no reason to click on this.  I will save the 20 seconds.  What do you think he sends you?  Like just worthless, unfunny little things you see on the line?  It's just, I can't even really explain what he sends.  Like stuff he finds interesting.  He's out and about it.  It's got to be nothing.  Look what I saw.  Food.  Look what I saw today.  And then you open it up and it's like a traffic cop or something.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  What's the point?  What are you trying to tell me here? 
[00:26:30]  Or it'll say Greg's Hardware Store because it's the same name as you.  You're like, oh, that's cool.  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck am I going to do with that?  Exactly.  Something like that.  Or screen caps like the fact that he's playing punch out.  Like, I don't.  Who cares?  Because look what I defeated today.  And then you click on it.  It's like, it's a screen cap of punch out.  Then he says, look what I lost to and it's obesity.  Sorry, Eric.  You were saying it.  Keyboard now when you're texting and stuff.  You had to hold it straight up and use it like that. 
[00:27:00]  But now you will be able to type in landscape mode.  That's pretty cool.  And use a much bigger keyboard on that thing.  So that's a plus.  That's something people were clamoring about.  Anthony, all those are pluses.  But the picture texting, though.  You're going to have to wait until the end of the summer.  I understand.  But that's just something they should have figured out way before all this other stuff.  Before you could text message using landscape. 
[00:27:30]  You should have figured it all out.  No, no.  The iPhone did.  It's AT&T that's got the problem.  AT&T's got the fucking big problem with this shit.  I know.  Pain in the ass.  Runtime error.  Something's going on with the phone.  I just lost the phones.  What?  We've had...  Oh, the phones have...  Yeah, why do they look different or not?  Because someone used our studio last night.  And every time someone uses our studio, and I'm not going to name names, the place is a mess. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  I just lost the phones, Mars.  Is it true every time someone uses a studio, there's problems the next day?  Yeah.  Seems to be, right?  I lost the phones.  Let's take a break, because the phones were lit, and it's important.  And we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Ah, yeah, that's right.  Let's go.  Dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun. 
[00:28:30]  Dun, dun, dun.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm trying to figure out what happened.  I have a spare battery for my MacBook Pro, and I carry it in my laptop carry-on bag, which I bring on the play with me.  So I opened it last night to put it in my computer, and it's exploded.  Like, it's burst out.  It looks like a popcorn thing that has burst out, and I don't know what's...  I'm going to Twitter it.  That looks like heat damage.  But from where?  I have the...  From in itself.  Like, the battery itself probably shorted out, heated up, and just warped the metal. 
[00:29:00]  Luckily, it didn't start a fire.  Jesus.  Because these Mac laptops, I think, look like...  Let me see.  Smell it.  You would smell a little fire damage, or a little, like, uh...  You might.  It does not smell like that at all.  There should be discoloration or something, if...  Yeah, what is...  Exactly what happened.  What's that?  This thing is so warped, though.  Yeah, why don't you open it up?  See what's inside.  No, I'm going to bring it to Mac like that.  I'll bring it like that.  Danny, what does that mean?  I bet you there's a cockroach living inside.  Oh, my God.  That is a picture of your fucking battery, dude.  Apparently, that's not the first one that's happened to. 
[00:29:30]  What happens to them?  Well, they expand, and it looks like they kind of explode.  But how do they...  Why do they expand?  Do they give a reason?  Not on this particular website.  Wow, but you sent a picture of Jimmy's battery.  Oh, I see.  The little cells in here kind of expanded and pushed it out.  Wow.  Are human cells...  Dude, that is...  Are they making...  That is an exact picture of this clusterfuck battery.  Look at that.  What the fuck, man?  It seems to be a problem other people have. 
[00:30:00]  So should I not leave this in my bag?  What's causing this?  Oh.  I'm going to burn my apartment down with a battery.  It doesn't seem to be the heat, but it's probably all the kitty porn trying to get out.  No, that's stuff I put on disk.  Not on the battery.  I know this as well.  I'm just...  Oh, kitty.  I spell it K-I-T-T-Y.  Yes, I like to fuck cats.  Meow.  Meow.  No, I don't know what it is, man.  I mean, nothing.  So...  Any answers?  Not yet.  I'll get to the bottom.  Yeah, Danny will get an answer.  Wow.  I got to bring The Hangover to the show's attention, because now I'm confused. 
[00:30:30]  I went and saw The Hangover yesterday.  Yeah.  I liked it.  It wasn't an over-the-top, holy shit, there's a million just incredible laughs in the movie,  but it's a well-written comedy.  Then I tweeted just that for the most part.  If you're not laughing in the first 20 minutes, should you leave?  I was definitely laughing throughout the whole movie, and then I tweeted that, and then people  said I didn't give it a good enough review. 
[00:31:00]  They're like, what?  That was one of the funniest movies ever.  But then other people said it was garbage, and it was horrible.  And then I get in today, and Jimmy said they were discussing The Hangover at The Cellar  last night, and Keith Robinson killed it, right?  He said he didn't like it.  Yeah, but Colin and Nick, I don't think had seen it, but he said he didn't like it.  Was he the only one that didn't see it?  I don't know.  I mean, the only one that saw it.  I'm sorry.  I believe he was, yeah.  I liked the movie.  So now I don't know what to...  I wonder what the listeners are thinking.  And then Mall Cop was brought up. 
[00:31:30]  Now, how much did Mall Cop make?  I finally sat down and watched Mall Cop.  I watched the first half hour to 40 minutes, and then I just got up off the couch.  There were a bunch of people over.  Threw yourself out a window?  Actually, I didn't have to get up, because everyone has remotes now.  But I picked up the remote and just pushed stop.  And everyone said, thank you.  You weren't laughing just at him on the Segway?  Why?  Not only was I not laughing at Mall Cop the first 40 minutes, I didn't even know where 
[00:32:00]  I was supposed to laugh if I was a comedy dummy.  You know what I mean?  Comedy dummies, yeah, that laugh at dumb movies.  Like, I wish I was in the theater, because then I would have went, oh, I'm supposed to  laugh.  I didn't even know where I was supposed to laugh.  You had no gauge?  No clue.  Like, was I supposed to laugh when he was on the Segway?  I don't know.  Because it's hysterical.  He's a big guy, and he's on a Segway.  Doing weird Segway things as a fat guy in a Segway. 
[00:32:30]  That's hysterical.  I know what Keith was complaining about with the movie.  Okay.  He said they were using props, and they said some of the writing he didn't like.  He said, I could see what the writers were doing.  It was so obvious.  He just didn't like how obvious some of the things were.  And again, I don't know what he's talking about, because I haven't seen it.  I thought as far as comedies go, it was well written.  Jesus, that movie.  It might have been.  Keith Serration.  Mall Cop made $147 million.  Oh, God.  Let's discuss the hangover for a couple minutes and Mall Cop.  Like, tell me where I was supposed to laugh in Mall Cop.  I really want to know. 
[00:33:00]  Knowing, by the way, that I only saw the first half hour to 40 minutes.  Yeah.  It was a long setup to the first laugh that I never got to.  First laugh.  And then I just threw in Network, and everyone was very happy to check on Network.  Oh, how great is it?  The movie's amazing.  What a brilliant insight he had into what television was going to be.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to remember, like, there was only a few TV channels when they made that.  They saw reality TV coming.  They saw all of it, man.  Patty Chester.  Reality.  Oh, geez. 
[00:33:30]  There go the phones.  They just disappeared.  Phones just disappeared.  Why does this company insist on sharing our studio if it can't be set up properly for our show, the main show?  We just lost, like, 10 or 12 really good fucking phones.  Yeah.  Someone was in studio yesterday.  I'm not even blaming that person.  I don't want to name names, but somebody that was associated with yesterday's show that was in this studio fucked up something because we can't get phones today. 
[00:34:00]  They just disappeared again, Morris.  Yeah.  They just vanished.  And this company insists on sharing this studio, which is fine if we don't ever notice.  Yeah, if we never know.  If we never knew someone was in here, I don't give a shit if they have an orgy in front of, you know, on this big table in front of us.  I could care less as long as they clean up and we don't have a clue.  But it's just, I don't know why so many things have to be touched.  We broadcast. 
[00:34:30]  Everything seems fine.  We barely touch anything.  Everything seems fine.  We take calls.  We talk into the microphones.  What are people doing?  Are they setting things so they could talk to Venus?  Like, what's the difference between us broadcasting and someone coming in here and broadcasting?  And we just set up a nice phone topic.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to the phones.  The phones were nice and lit with comments about those two movies.  Some liked it.  Some didn't like it.  We were going to try to discuss it a little bit. 
[00:35:00]  And then, poof, there go the phones.  Look at this connect.  And then, does it even connect?  A connection to the server could not be made.  It's just a catastrophe.  Out of all, there are, how many studios are here?  Why do they have to use this one?  You think our fucking, yeah, you think everybody else's phones just go out like this?  You know, during breaks, I walk down the long hall to the bathroom.  There are so many studios that are just not being used here.  Yeah.  And I would imagine it's the same thing at night.  So have them use another one. 
[00:35:30]  More so at night, I would say.  Yeah, why can't they just use a different studio?  Just don't use this fucking studio.  This should be for us and Imran and Fez.  Because it doesn't seem like they destroy the fucking thing.  But it's this late night shit.  People come in and then there's always an excuse or something.  I don't know.  Are they going to work now?  You don't know, right?  Connect.  They're going to work until they don't work.  At least Mars is honest.  Can't win for losing.  Let's make a pact. 
[00:36:00]  If the phones crap out again, we go home.  Oh, Jesus.  Even if they don't.  We need proper equipment.  Even if they don't.  I have a very short throat.  We need proper equipment to do our show.  Yeah.  We need a...  Oh.  That was a dial tone.  That's probably a good sign.  Did you see Mall Cop?  Me?  Fuck no.  And my pal is in it.  I know.  Adam Farrar is in it.  I didn't get to Adam Farrar.  Yeah.  Didn't get to his scene?  I wanted to.  Yeah.  Because I think I would have turned off Mall Cop in the first ten minutes. 
[00:36:30]  Because I realize, wow, there's nothing here for me.  Uh-huh.  And then I'm like, wait, Adam's in this though.  Maybe.  All right.  I'll try to get to Adam's part.  Yeah.  Just to tell him, you know, I saw Mall Cop next time he comes in here.  I never got to Adam's part.  You know, I'm sure he's done some projects where he's just like, eh, eh, eh, catch the  check.  Oh, God.  It's amazing that, like, as a performer...  A performer!  I want to say, Kevin James is actually a good comic or whatever. 
[00:37:00]  It's like, you do a movie like that.  He had a hit show, though, so it's hard to say, but it's like, you do a movie that makes  $140 million.  You're made.  Exactly.  That's it.  Yeah.  You're doing a couple of more fucking multi-million dollar films you set for life.  Yeah, you fucking, you made a successful movie.  It doesn't matter if people thought it was shit.  But what's confusing, we talked to some of these guys that have been in movies that are  definitely shit.  Shit.  But made a lot of money.  Uh-huh.  And you kind of call them out on the fact that the movie sucked.  And they go, what? 
[00:37:30]  It made $100 million.  That has happened a few times on our show.  Seth Rogen got mad.  It happened with Seth Rogen.  And what's his name?  There was at least another person.  No, with...  Not Seth Rogen.  No, Seth Green.  Seth Green.  I'm sorry.  Seth Green.  Seth Green.  Seth Green.  I brought up that River movie, Up the River, or whatever the fuck it was called.  Because we were having fun with the guy, and he's obviously had a very successful career.  Yeah.  He's in some amazing things.  So we're like, oh, but that Up the Creek thing. 
[00:38:00]  I go, yeah, but you did that frigging River movie.  He goes, uh, that River movie made $100 and something.  Like, I take a joke.  But that's the question.  Do you think in their world that means it was a success?  Or do you think someone like Kevin James goes, huh, I know it made $147 million, but I'm  not proud of that film.  I bet both.  You really think both?  Yeah.  Both, sure.  You know who knows?  A guy like Michael Madsen.  That's an honest gentleman.  Yep.  He knows when he's making a big tub of shit.  Because he'll fucking admit it right on his website. 
[00:38:30]  Go, here, I use this one to make a car payment.  I use this movie to pay the mortgage.  Dennis Leary did that recently.  Oh, did he?  Interesting.  Dennis Leary decided to do that.  Maybe you don't like your sandwich?  It's all right.  Make it a face.  You don't like your cream cheese bagel?  Okay.  It's all right?  It's all right.  You must like it because there's cream cheese on your upper lip.  You're enjoying it.  Clockwork Orange. 
[00:39:00]  What's job and how much?  The most obnoxious chewing in a film.  Oh, yeah.  Ever.  Is what?  Bar none, I said.  Clockwork, yeah.  Absolutely.  Which is worse?  Mall Cop or Chuck and Larry?  Did you see Chuck and Larry?  I wouldn't fucking turn that on if my family was in danger.  And the only way to get them out of danger was to watch that. 
[00:39:30]  Who are they making these comedies for?  Comedy.  Who are they making it for?  Are people out there that dumb?  I don't think our audience is that dumb.  There'll probably be a few that will now call and defend Chuck and Larry.  But in general, our audience would say no fucking way.  No way, no how.  They have to get married.  They're two men.  It would be funny if they had to go through with everything and fuck each other.  There it is, just a fucking sloppy party bottom. 
[00:40:00]  You know, if you're going to make a bad movie that makes over $100 million, it should be in  your contract that you've got to take it in the ass on film.  Chuck and Larry made $120 million.  Fuck.  I don't get it.  Kevin James has done two comedy films.  I know Sandler's in one, which is massive.  But he's been like one of the leads in two movies, $267 million fucking dollars, that  guy.  And it wasn't a movie where you needed like a CGI or anything like that, so it wasn't  one of these high production movies. 
[00:40:30]  Just the actor's salaries and whatever.  I think what a lot of these films appeal to, and one of the reasons they do so well.  Mongoloids?  The Pete Rose haircuts are endless.  But no, I think it's because a lot of people, I happen to like mean comedy.  That makes me laugh.  Yep.  Or what people think is mean.  But I think a lot of people want their comedy to not be mean.  And it seems like a lot of the films that do tremendously well don't have an element 
[00:41:00]  of real meanness in them.  Yeah.  They're just kind of silly and they are kind of like, oh, come on now.  And I think people like that a little bit more than the mean stuff.  My gauge is off.  Mean rules.  You like to observe and report.  I fucking, I never laugh in movies.  That movie, when Ray Liotta screamed at him, I hate your fucking guts.  I think that's what he, I fucking screamed in the theater.  But when they were bashing, when Seth Rogen and the other guy are taking skateboards and  breaking them across those teenagers' faces and heads, it was violent and hilarious. 
[00:41:30]  Because it's violent, it's something you, out of the ordinary.  I really laughed at that.  Seth Rogen was, oh, come on, he's fucking Anna Faris.  She's passed out and she's got vomit on her and he's fucking her.  And the film, they had to make it look like it was hilarious in that film.  It wasn't a rape?  It wasn't a rape.  So she's like, come on.  Come on already.  Let's go.  Which I was like, all right.  I guess they had to do that because it was a rape.  But it was like she had puke on her and he's fucking her.  And I'm like, that's what a comedy should be.  Like, that's it right there. 
[00:42:00]  That's reality.  But it was a movie about a serial killer.  And they were showing him having sex with a passed out girl.  They would show it like that to portray it like that.  But because it's a fucking comedy, you have to soften it.  I never understood that.  Yeah, yeah.  Why does comedy have to be softened but drama doesn't?  I know.  That's a very good question.  Hey, a lot of people say Mall Cop was definitely funnier than Chuck and Larry or Larry and Chuck  or whatever the fuck.  What was it called again?  For real.  Chuck and Larry.  Chuck and Larry.  Mike in Boston.  What's up, boys? 
[00:42:30]  Hey.  All right.  Paul Blatt wasn't too bad.  I mean, oh, no, wait a minute.  That movie fucking sucks.  I just thought that was awful.  Both those movies could lick my frigging balls.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Lick his balls.  Yeah.  I hated them.  They were frigging awful.  I watched that whole Mall Cop movie.  And what the hell was with, like, skateboarders and bikers doing jumps into the frigging scenes?  I mean, honestly, you're robbing a mall and you have, like, bikers doing jumps?  See, I never got to that point. 
[00:43:00]  He lost me in the first half hour.  I just couldn't sit through it anymore.  He pulled over an old guy that was on a scooter or something.  I'm like, what?  That's hysterical.  Was he on a Segway when he did it?  Yeah.  He was on a Segway.  That's funny.  And the old guy's on, like, a little rascal scooter.  And he's yelling at the guy, pull over, pull over.  Oh, come on, dude.  Come on.  That's hysterical stuff.  I don't even know why he pulled the guy over in the mall.  I was like, what?  Why would he do that?  Do you know what made me laugh?  Used cars made me laugh. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I got to watch used cars, man.  Mean-spirited.  Big, big, black Frank McRae when he's trying to sell the car to the old guy.  He's fucking, there's nothing funny.  Look at his face.  He's on the Segway.  He's got a little blue light on it, too, which I'm sure at some point in the movie it goes on.  And it's like, look, he's got a little rotating beacon on it.  He doesn't need that.  Let's say hi to Tony in New York.  Tony.  You know, to Jimmy's point, Adam Sandler, when he made Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, 
[00:44:00]  those were funny movies and they were raw.  And then he came out with A Wedding Singer and it was, you know, safe, funny comedy.  It was okay, but it wasn't great comedy.  Yeah, I thought The Wedding Singer was all right.  I love The Wedding Singer.  But I think you make a good point.  The Wedding Singer is where he started changing.  Yeah, yeah.  Into the sensitive.  I was excited to watch that movie.  What was it called?  Click?  Where he had a remote control that could control the world in front of him.  I thought the concept was good. 
[00:44:30]  And then all of a sudden it went into this deep fucking weird place.  Like, what are you doing?  Trying to, like, give us a message?  Just give us some laughs.  That's exactly what he did.  A message tried to come out of it.  Is there anything worse than comedies that try to give you a message?  Ow.  The message is always predictable.  That's what's annoying.  Yeah, yeah.  It's never, like, an interesting point.  It's always the same.  Oh, we get it.  You're a comic.  You hate this.  We get it.  It's always the same.  I've never seen the Adam Sandler film, so I don't know.  Never. 
[00:45:00]  Not one?  Not on purpose.  I just haven't seen one.  Happy Gilmore was fun.  Yeah, I never saw him.  Yeah, that was fun.  That was a pretty good movie.  That was your typical underdog against the snobby guy kind of thing.  The one with the little kid.  What was that called again, Ant?  Big Daddy.  Big Daddy I liked.  Big Daddy.  You liked Big Daddy?  Yeah, that was kind of safe, but.  What about.  Oh, my God.  You know, I never saw that movie.  You never saw it?  I just know the character like anyone else.  Little Nicky. 
[00:45:30]  Was Little Nicky good?  Did you see it?  It was so weird.  You don't know?  He's the son of fucking Satan.  Hey, for the boys down the hall, I heard about this.  Kevin from Connecticut.  John Sterling had a horrendous home run call yesterday.  Oh, what else?  Oh, wow.  Nick Swisher hit a home run, so you can only imagine what he came up with.  Swish goes the ball.  Oh, Swisher?  I don't know.  I can't even say his name.  Yeah, or Swisher.  Swisher? 
[00:46:00]  Swisher?  Huh?  Swisher.  Swisher?  That's how you pronounce it?  All right.  Wait till you hear the home run call.  Do we have it?  We're going to get it.  Is it a Swisher?  Wisher?  It probably rhymed.  Waterboy, you like Waterboy?  No.  Waterboy had its moments.  Let's say hi to Marcos in New York.  Marcos.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I know.  I was going to say Waterboy was a pretty funny movie.  You guys all didn't like that one?  I saw it so many years ago.  I would have to see it again.  I remember there were a couple good scenes in it. 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  He was just...  He was too...  He was too old.  He was too old.  The way he was tackling people, it was pretty funny.  I don't know.  He's too fucking weird in it.  Like that over-the-top shit is just too weird.  His mom wouldn't let him get laid?  My mama says, oh God, that stupid fucking voice again, all right?  All right, boys.  Had it with him.  Not a fan of Adam Sandler?  Not at all anymore.  Let's say hi to Keith.  Keith. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  This isn't the break we were trying to do.  We really want to talk about why Mall Cop was considered funny, and if anyone saw The Hangover,  and what's your opinion on the movie?  Is it good or bad?  I liked it.  Yeah.  But some people say, no, it sucked.  It was horrible, so I want to gauge that movie today a little bit, too.  Somehow we went off to Adam Sandler sucks now.  Yeah, no kidding.  All right, go ahead, Keith.  We got you on the line.  What's up?  Yeah, listen, man.  The Adam Sandler movies are just terrible.  Come on.  What about like real comedies? 
[00:47:30]  Easy Money, Animal House.  Those are the funny movies.  That's what we should be gauging new movies on.  You know what?  They're trying to go back to those type of comedies.  They really are.  Yeah.  With the whole Seth Rogen gang and stuff, they're really trying to go back to that Animal House  type of comedy.  We're getting there, I think.  I feel good where these comedies go in lately.  You know what?  They don't seem to be as a cookie cutter anymore.  I saw a movie recently that was just, I sat through it, but it wasn't funny at all. 
[00:48:00]  Porky's.  Porky's.  Porky's.  Doesn't hold up.  It's not funny.  I don't even know about holding up.  It just isn't funny.  I'm watching it going, there isn't a laugh in this thing at all.  It's like, you know, you watch it because, okay, here they go.  They go over to Porky's and then Porky fucks them over and then they wreck Porky's place.  The end.  That fucking peewee character that is trying to get laid is so over-the-top stupid. 
[00:48:30]  Why?  Why so bad?  I don't remember.  What's so bad?  Yeah, I'm going to have to watch Porky's again.  Oh, he's just too, like everything's about getting laid and he's too over-the-top about  it and I don't know.  And the girls in it are supposed to be hot.  They're not.  Wow.  And when they're looking through that little peephole into the shower.  They're huge muffs, right?  Huge, huge fucking muffs.  Dude, those muffs were giant, giant muffs. 
[00:49:00]  Just want to talk to the youth of America.  We took one for the team for you guys.  Oh, Christ.  We used to have to dig into that shit.  Did we ever.  There's the show.  Look.  Oh, my God.  Look at the muffs.  If you saw that today, wouldn't that just scare the fuck out of you?  No, like I said, I wouldn't mind a little hair these days.  Really?  Just to see.  You know why?  Get out of my house.  You know why?  Get out.  Everyone fucking shaves it down these days.  How about you change it up a little bit? 
[00:49:30]  Look at the muffler.  Looks like she's wearing black panties.  It's ridiculous.  The one in the back right there.  That's like.  Those were supposed to be hot girls.  But that's like.  They're all right.  But the one in the middle is all right.  I got to fucking just.  Every pussy now is shaved completely raw.  And I don't know.  What do we need?  A little something going on there?  Let's just get a little something growing there.  Can we just get a little something there? 
[00:50:00]  Wow, you're very disappointed, man.  To remember.  No, just to remember what that looked like.  Memories?  Yes.  Nostalgia.  Cue up memories.  I just want a little nostalgia when it comes to some fucking muff.  That's why they called it Muff Bush Pussy.  That's what the fucking name came from.  By gum.  There have been a lot of pussies out there that are hairless cats.  No, that ain't many.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that front.  Look at her. 
[00:50:30]  Through the little hole.  I think she was one of the stars of the movie.  Look at that.  See, it was just that triangle of hair that made you go like, oh, look, because it's hair,  but there's no dick there.  And you wonder if they shampoo it or use soap.  Yeah.  Which one?  Just one of those things that you kind of like.  I want to give props to that last caller.  We lost him a few minutes ago, but he mentioned Easy Money as a good comedy.  Yeah.  Bravo to you, my friend.  That was a good one.  How many people saw Easy Money, you think? 
[00:51:00]  That doesn't come up in comedy discussions.  No.  Let's say hi to Pete in New York.  Pete.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Pete.  Hey, I saw The Hangover this weekend.  I thought it was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Don't jump out.  Just bury it.  You think just bury it?  Just drag it down where it's not in the way.  You sure?  Yeah.  And just leave it.  Just put it in the corner.  Marge, we might lose the phones.  I'm like, I'm moving this thing like it's plutonium. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, you're moving it like it's a bomb.  Something just came up, a runtime error, invalid property value.  And do not hit OK.  Just look at this streak it made across the phone.  Oh, look at it.  Just erased everything.  Hit OK.  You're fine.  Oh, you want me to hit OK?  No.  The phones will die.  Yeah, they will.  Just because I wasn't able to email them.  Steve Blatter, this is causing major problems on our show today once again.  See if we can take another call without it blowing up. 
[00:52:00]  Don't touch that.  Where's the mouse?  Oh, you can't do anything until you...  You have to hit OK.  It's the only way to do it.  Or just shut it down.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wait, wait.  You didn't lose your caller.  We didn't lose the caller or all the callers?  No, none of the callers are lost.  None of them are lost?  Hello?  Yeah.  We can't hang up on you, so just say whatever the fuck you want.  It's your show now.  It's your show now.  For real.  Go ahead.  You're the boss. 
[00:52:30]  Go ahead.  Go.  This is a rare opportunity.  You can say whatever the fuck you want.  We can't do shit.  That's right.  All right.  Let's talk about the hangover, Oak.  I like the hangover.  What do you think of the last one minute of all those pictures?  What do you say at the end of the show for the movie, sir?  Let's just say, yeah, I mean, we're trying not to be dicks like we used to be with movies.  Let's just say the last few minutes of the movie was just amazing.  It was good?  Oh, it just, there was an excitement in the theater when they did what they did at the end. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  Yeah.  It brought it all together nicely.  I am.  Yeah, I agree.  I thought it was hysterical.  I'm not trying to give anything away.  Sorry.  It's okay.  Did you see Mall Cop?  I saw Mall Cop, and I did the same thing you did.  20 minutes, half an hour, shut it right off.  I thought it was awful.  It really was bad.  I mean, you know, we know Kevin's a nice guy and all that, very successful, and he doesn't  need our endorsement.  He does very well for himself, but I think I would be embarrassed if I was him, for real. 
[00:53:30]  Really?  That bad?  Yeah.  I didn't understand where, you got to, like, if I at least knew that I was supposed to  laugh somewhere, I'd go, okay, someone out there's laughing because this is where  you're supposed to laugh.  Right.  They should have had, like, that, like, laugh, like, light go on or something.  A little light.  That would help.  All right, boys.  I'm just looking up at the Morning Joe show, Joe Scarborough's book, The Last Best Hope,  and the picture is him on the cover, like, with his arms folded.  That is, looks fucking horrendous. 
[00:54:00]  These two fruits.  How big is fucking Joe Scarborough?  Is he 6'8"?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God, no.  I'm just...  Oh, my God.  Hold on, hold on.  Are people mad at me since I said that?  Just breathe.  Just breathe.  No, the runtime error thing came up again.  Mars fixed it.  And this is because someone used our studio again last night.  Yeah.  The company insists that people use our studio, even though they told us they were going to  give us our own studio.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  And all we ask is that the studio is put back the way it was so we could not be distracted  and taken completely out of our game.  Yeah.  We have been taken completely out of our game.  Because we're trying so hard to hang on here by our fingernails and not lose our minds  and smash shit.  But it's getting very difficult to do that.  Like, I wanted to talk to Lydia.  We're completely out of our game.  I want to talk to the guy about John Hughes' comedies.  Because he says it ruined a comedy. 
[00:55:00]  I disagree.  That would be a great phone call.  And I would like to know why he says that.  Yeah.  Bad Santa is the best movie.  I loved Bad Santa.  That's the type of movie you would like.  You ever see Jimmy?  I did enjoy that, yeah.  Yeah.  Because it's mean-spirited.  You know, Billy Bob annoys me so fucking much.  How could I have liked the guy so much and just hate his guts now?  I know.  Like, in Sling Blade, he was fantastic.  He was fantastic?  You hated him in Bad Santa?  No, he was funny then.  I just, I don't know what, I think after they softened the Bad News Bears and he's supposed  to be an edgy guy.  Dude.  Astronaut Farmer he was really good at. 
[00:55:30]  Don't get me started with that Bad News Bears.  It sucked.  Well, Bad News Bears, that remake was an embarrassment to comedy.  How do you fuck with Bad News Bears and make it kind of like kid and family friendly?  Wasn't there no drunk driving in, like no beer in their car or something?  Yeah, instead of drinking beer, they were drinking, I don't even remember.  You can't show the kids drinking because that's a bad message.  It's unbelievable.  Lydia, I think we still have you.  Hi, guys.  Good morning.  Hi, Lydia.  So, I want you to know, Anthony, if you are so jaded that bald pussy doesn't even turn 
[00:56:00]  you on.  Did I, hey, Ms. Shrink, did I ever say it didn't turn me on?  All I'm saying is a little variety.  Every girl thinks that they just got to shave that fucking thing down a bare skin.  And every fucking day.  Or else it's not going to be attractive to anybody.  I would like to see some hair down there at some point. 
[00:56:30]  Just even if I want to look and just go, okay, that's what it looks like.  I forgot what a fucking pussy with hair on it looks like.  Do we need to start a new website?  No, we do not.  Savethehair.com for Anthony.  Savethehair.com.  No, you know why?  Because they get these fetish ones like that.  See, look.  Look.  See, that's a little too much.  I don't like weeds around the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't mind a little hair above, but then when it's like, it's on the border of the... 
[00:57:00]  See, you're going one extreme to the other.  And I'm not...  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  Better watch out.  What?  The curtains aren't closed.  Um, I'm saying we, we, you're going one extreme to the other.  Either shaved or fucking wolf man.  It's...  And I'm not talking the little landing strip or the Hitler mustache that looks ridiculous.  I'm talking natural shape triangle, but well-kept, you know?  Just kind of, uh, uh, trimmed. 
[00:57:30]  No.  And, and just looking like a pussy.  Why triangle?  No.  Just kind of the shape.  That's what used to be popular.  What's that?  That's what used to be popular.  Are you shaved, Lydia?  I'm shaved.  How much do you shave?  I shave it all.  Oh, sexy.  See, some women shouldn't shave it all.  I think after a certain age, some women should stop shaving that fucking thing, shaving it all.  No.  I was thinking about that, Anthony.  Stop it.  Bullshit.  Here's what hair is.  It's, it's a leftover from evolution. 
[00:58:00]  We don't need it to keep warm.  All it does is make it stink.  I like to see the lips.  There's no reason for a bunch of tangled, ugly hair.  It gets sweaty and matted down.  It looks like a forehead.  It's terrible.  A forehead?  It's fucking terrible.  You ever see a lawyer's forehead?  That's what a pussy was...  During a tough case.  Yeah, exactly.  The little hair's all matted.  It's fucking horrendous.  I'm not talking about that.  And I'm not talking about these bushes that Danny's putting up on the screen.  Danny must be... 
[00:58:30]  What did you put in the search?  Oh, my God.  Big, fat, hairy pussies.  That looks like a head wound.  For real.  That does look like Kennedy.  That looks like a Kennedy photo.  That looks like Kennedy's autopsy photo.  Oh, my God, why?  That's...  No, see...  That's disgusting.  I'm not talking about that.  That's fucking horrendous, man.  I'm talking about a nicely trimmed...  Everything's nicey-nice.  Nicey-nice.  All in order.  Well taken care of.  But there's something down there.  There was just something about the underwear coming off, the little panties coming off, 
[00:59:00]  and seeing that little tuft.  Perfect.  Right there, right?  See, look.  There's a little bit on there.  It lets you know it's there.  You got the chimp lips.  The chimp lips.  Looking real nice.  And you got a little something going on above it.  Homer Simpson mouth.  How about this?  It's Homer Simpson mouth.  Nice.  You look in the panties, and you see a big, fat bulge, and it's all lips.  And then you pull it off, and it's bald, and that whole big bulge you were looking at  was all lips.  And here's what's worse.  When you think there's a big, sexy pair of lips, and you pull it off, and you realize 
[00:59:30]  it was the fucking hair puffing out the panties...  See, I wouldn't be into that at all.  I wouldn't be into the big, hairy thing like that.  That's the Jiffy Pop popcorn.  The big hairy.  Yeah.  Making Jiffy Pop popcorn in her underwear.  I'm sort of figuring out how...  All right, Lydia, please shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up, really.  Just shut the fuck up.  Can't Lydia just be fun sometimes?  I think what's going on, Lydia, can't you just...  I think it's...  What these women are thinking is there's a... 
[01:00:00]  No, it's weird.  I actually like Lydia.  Sure.  She's sexy for her age.  Yeah.  But it's the voice.  Yeah.  It goes right through you.  Really does.  I'm so sorry about that.  Can you do something about your voice, and then maybe I won't tell you to shut the fuck  up so much?  Yeah.  Well, I don't mind so much, Opie.  I don't mind.  Why don't you do some of that morning drinking?  The Patty thing.  How's the drinking going?  Oh, drinking's going so fine.  I think Gary's put me back on the wagon again.  Oh, really?  I had an episode. 
[01:00:30]  What was the episode?  Oh, boy.  It was a long weekend, you know.  Lost weekend?  She woke up with a man of questionable ethnicity in a motel.  Long weekend.  She doesn't feel like holding your hair for eight hours every weekend.  Holding her hair.  Yeah.  All right.  You okay?  Oh, shit.  Can I go back to the game?  It's the bourbon barbecue.  Hair's in the toilet.  Yeah.  All right, Lydia.  We got to go.  And unfortunately, we got 10 phone calls on hold with great stuff. 
[01:01:00]  But as I do this, watch the phones go.  That'll be fine.  Poof.  Oh, they're gone.  Just lost the phones.  Again.  Because the company insists on sharing our studio.  Mars.  And now, you get a show today that is very distracted.  That's half-assed, as I like to call it.  How does that make sense?  It's a half-assed show.  I don't know how that makes sense.  But for some reason, it makes sense to the company.  We're not very likely.  They continue to do this to us.  No.  No.  We're broken records.  We're assholes. 
[01:01:30]  Every time someone uses a studio, there's a problem.  Simple as that.  Simple as that.  We're assholes.  That's what we are.  We're the assholes.  I think so.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  What the fuck is this?  We could have made it to eight.  We could have just skated to eight o'clock with some fun phone calls.  Now we've got to take another break and have Mars fix the phones, hopefully.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I want to play this Derek thing from yesterday.  It's terrific.  It really is.  We got into a discussion.  Anthony just needs Jim to graduate high school. 
[01:02:00]  It's been an ongoing thing on the show for many years.  And it's never going to go back to high school to take Jim to get his diploma.  Of course not.  But we had a little fun with the fact that Anthony never graduated high school.  And possibly maybe he goes back to high school.  And it's a different story.  Right.  Jimmy thought it would make a nice comedy.  Great sitcom.  Like a great sitcom.  And started singing my little theme song.  And Derek took it and put it to music.  Oh, he's older than the teachers. 
[01:02:30]  And he makes more money than the whole school.  He's an alcoholic.  He's Anthony.  He's the oldest kid in class.  He gets them drugs and fucks their hineys.  His big delicious cock.  Shouldn't be black.  It's not.  He's Anthony.  Oh, he carries a trapper keeper full of Hitler photographs.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  He tries to be everyone's friend. 
[01:03:00]  But he gives all the girls the creeps.  They think he's somebody's father who just showed up for no reason.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  We'll try this again.  Opie and Anthony.  I guess we just blew off the phone topics.  We had some good phone topics.  I know.  People wanted to talk about Harry Muffs.  They wanted to talk about Mall Cop.  They wanted to talk about the hangover.  So many things.  What else?  What else? 
[01:03:30]  So many topics.  We need our phones for our show.  I know.  Sorry for all the filler, but we had guys in here like rewiring stuff and trying to figure  out what's up with the phones.  Pain in the ass.  All good stuff to hear, but maybe not back to back to back to back to back.  No.  You're supposed to sprinkle that stuff in.  A little bit here, a little bit there.  Now what?  I don't know what to do.  We could talk about all these checks I have.  None of them are more than $22.  What are they from?  There's 13 of them. 
[01:04:00]  Are they royalty?  Royalties for Lucky Louie.  Yeah.  I still get them, but it's funny.  Every time they sell it to this network, whatever happens to it, it just gets less and less.  Yeah.  And now my check's like $23.  It's going to be down to a couple of pennies.  Someday, sure.  Like Jerry.  What was Jerry's show?  Seinfeld.  Happy.  No.  I know.  It was Seinfeld.  I think it was Super Fun Time Happy Hour.  Super Fun Time Happy Hour in Japan.  He was the guy. 
[01:04:30]  And he kept getting one penny checks.  Who?  Jerry.  On one of the episodes of Seinfeld.  Oh.  You know that show he did.  That little show.  A little show named Seinfeld.  That's another one I really...  I might have seen two episodes of Seinfeld in my life.  Really?  Not funny.  I hear it's a great show.  I don't know why.  Really?  I was going to ask you if you like it or don't.  No.  What I've seen of it was really well written.  Yeah?  I mean, funny.  Hey, why is it important that we know Kenny Rankin died of lung cancer at the age of 69? 
[01:05:00]  Kenny Rankin died?  Singer-songwriter?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  No, Jerry.  Come on.  Kenny Rankin?  Of course.  What songs?  I've heard of them.  Oh, okay.  What the fuck is he?  What was his big song?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Didn't he write Memories?  No.  A little jerky.  Also, Slash's mother died of cancer overnight.  Age 62.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, a banana.  And our old friend, Bodden? 
[01:05:30]  Yes.  Michael?  Michael Bodden?  Yes, you are.  What about him?  Hope he's not dead.  No, but he's doing David Carradine's ghoulish autopsy.  Oh, he is.  Oh, good.  He got the job.  Wow.  Oh, love it.  He's doing the ghoulish autopsy.  Damn, yo.  That Bodden loves death.  He loves it.  God, he can't get enough of it.  Yes.  Kenny Rankin.  What was his big hit, Danny?  You know?  I have no idea.  That's the songs right there?  A song for you?  I think this is like his latest thing. 
[01:06:00]  It's on the prep sheet, so he had to have one song we all know, I'm thinking.  I know the name.  You do know the name?  Yes.  Is he a country guy, right?  Was he?  American Pop and Jazz.  American Pop and Jazz.  Okay.  Who put him on the prep sheet?  Give us the hit.  Travis?  Who is he?  I don't know, but usually when it's like the...  Look, when something is the main headline on Yahoo Entertainment, I figure, hey, you know 
[01:06:30]  what?  Someone has to know.  It should probably be on the prep sheet.  Yeah, but what if he's a singer?  Wouldn't we have his songs ready?  Like, or something?  Dude, he has like a hundred songs in Dillette.  I have no idea what his...  All right, we're just looking for the big hit that he had.  Yeah, what's one of them?  He must have had a big hit.  Start naming Kenny Rankin songs.  Did he sing these, or did he just write them for other people?  I know I've heard his name, too.  I have no idea who this fucking guy is.  On and On?  Or was?  He did On and On?  Stephen Bishop had a major hit with his song On and On. 
[01:07:00]  On and On is like a 70s pop fluff.  Give me a little On and On.  Fuck, this guy won't be missed.  Fuck.  I'm sorry.  Why are you angry?  I just don't...  I don't think this guy will be missed.  Because he had one song he didn't like, all of a sudden, good and glad he's off the earth.  You're a tough critic, Ant.  You know this song. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, everybody knows this.  This isn't the version everybody knows.  Yeah, it is.  This is Stephen Bishop.  No, no.  No?  This isn't the version.  Travis is the king of the not-the-version everyone knows.  I'm the king of playing Kenny Rankin's On and On.  King of the Trees.  Hey.  No way, no how.  You're fucking king of the trees.  Not me.  No way.  Not once.  Not never.  Not never.  No way. 
[01:08:00]  King of the Trees.  No way.  This is garbage.  This isn't the version everyone knows.  Anyone knows is more accurate.  You want Steve Bishop?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  See, what happens with these songwriters, they write these hit songs for other people.  Other people may get a huge hit, and then the songwriter decides, you know what?  I'm going to do my own version.  I'll do my own thing.  There you go.  You were right.  Now, that's the version, everybody.  How do you know?  Wait, no, Travis, get one that was sung at a birthday party in the Midwest in 1980. 
[01:08:30]  You asshole.  Oh, she's in love with old Sam, taken from the fire and to the frying pan.  Hey, remember this?  Yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut has some Stephen Bishop trivia.  No.  You want to guess?  Not really, but no.  Okay, let's give it a try.  Don't look up there.  I can't look up there.  All right.  What's the trivia?  Who the fuck is Stephen Bishop? 
[01:09:00]  And I don't know if this is true.  Ask a few questions.  We'll get there.  All right.  Isn't he going to ask?  No.  He's got, it's on instant feedback.  He gave me a little Stephen Bishop trivia.  Stephen Bishop was in Animal House.  You knew this?  Yes.  He's the guy on the stairs playing the fucking guitar.  Did you look down?  Blue sheet.  No, there's nothing.  I have nothing in front of me.  How'd you know that?  Because I knew it was Stephen Bishop.  And that was give my love a cherry or whatever the fuck he sang that.  I gave my love a cherry that had no stone. 
[01:09:30]  I get it.  And Belushi takes the.  And that was Stephen Bishop?  Yeah.  On the stairs?  Stephen Bishop.  Right on.  Kevin from Connecticut.  And you knew that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  For real.  I don't know.  It's just one of those like Animal House trivia things.  God damn it.  Give yourself a bell, motherfucker.  All righty.  The fuck you waiting for?  That's my bell.  Let's say hi to Ray in Philly.  Ray, what's up?  Hey. 
[01:10:00]  No, you don't have to call me Ray.  You can call me Ray.  Or you can call me Jay.  Or you can call me Johnny.  Or you can call me Ray J. Johnny.  Or you can call me John Ray Johnson.  That is a funny bit.  It's hysterical.  It's terrific.  Ray.  Hi, Ray.  Kenny Rankin.  You guys are too young.  So, Kenny Rankin was introduced by Helen Reddy as a very good songwriter.  Helen Reddy.  Ex-drug addict. 
[01:10:30]  Ex-drug addict.  Yeah.  He recovered from drugs and Helen Reddy brought him out on his show.  Because I got two of his albums.  But I would have to pick his hits from a list.  Hey, this is Big Ray, by the way.  This is Big Ray.  Say hi to the rest of the Rays.  The whole family is Ray.  Who's Big Ray?  Ray is very close to me and my family down to Kelly.  You don't have to call him Ray.  I'm going to use you guys to recover again.  I had a major setback at work. 
[01:11:00]  I heard.  What happened?  But you're going to freak out, Anthony.  You got shut down?  The same thing happened to your phone system happened to my body.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  What happened?  I'm coming back.  What happened?  You passed out?  I took a seizure and got CPR.  Jesus.  And the CPR is very, very hard to recover from.  We helped him recover from a little brain surgery.  And now he's back on the job.  He had a little seizure.  Holy fuck.  His brain shut down like our phone system. 
[01:11:30]  Getting the heebie-jeebies.  Yeah, you're freaking out, Ant Pig Ray.  You're a fun guy in the morning, Ray.  I was able to get my...  The guys got me out of the crane.  I locked everything down.  Everything was cool.  So I had a couple minutes' notice.  But everything's coming back?  Yeah, it's all coming back.  I'm listening to you guys all the time.  All right, Big Ray.  Hang in there.  I remember Kenny Rankin.  Yeah.  Helen Reddy.  Hey, that's good.  That means the seizure wasn't too bad.  That means we have to question his information.  He could be totally wrong.  Helen Reddy could have nothing to do with this.  Can you imagine?  I can remember the 70s and not yesterday. 
[01:12:00]  We might have to test you to make sure your brain's still there, Ray.  It could be all about Helen Reddy for this guy.  Can you imagine?  He lost everything.  Everything's Helen Reddy.  Everything.  Who was that?  She was in Deep Throat.  Helen Reddy.  Everything's Helen Reddy, this man.  He's obsessed.  He lost everything.  He's got Kenny Rankin knowledge.  That's all he remembers is Kenny Rankin and Helen Reddy.  It's the answer for everything.  That would be very tragic.  All right, Ray.  I'm glad you're doing well, my friend.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Say hi to the rest of the Rays.  Big Ray, Little Ray, and what?  Middle Ray, we call him? 
[01:12:30]  Hello.  The horn.  My last name's Horn, so it's the horn section.  Yeah, the horn section.  All right.  Thank you, Ray.  All right.  Thanks.  I hope you're good.  All right.  Yep.  Let's say hi to JJ.  JJ.  Hey, good morning, boys.  JJ.  Hey, JJ.  JJ.  JJ.  JJ.  JJ.  JJ.  JJ.  JJ.  JJ.  Hey, I just wanted to see if you guys had seen on What Would Tyler Durden Do?  It was apparently an article out of the New York Times that was announced on Larry King.  That's ridiculous.  If David Carradine's family doesn't believe that he committed suicide or died in the way 
[01:13:00]  he did, he was murdered by black ninjas whose secret society he was working to uncover.  No, they actually, you know what they really think happened?  They actually think that he was strangled by Helen Reddy.  That's all I'm talking about for the rest of the day is Helen Reddy.  While listening to Kenny Rankin's On and On song.  Kenny Rankin.  What's a Helen Reddy song, Travis?  I'm sure you have heard of it.  Oh, I am woman.  Hear me roar.  I am woman.  Hear me roar.  Hear me roar.  Give us a little Helen Reddy.  And the press is too big to ignore.  Well, JJ, the problem there, I mean, the family, you know, they want to distract the 
[01:13:30]  fact that he had a rope tied around his cock.  I mean.  So wouldn't you come up with something like black ninjas?  Yeah, you got to come up with even the most ridiculous story kind of throws an element  of doubt in there.  And gets people talking about other theories instead of the fact that he had a rope around  his cock.  A rope around his cock.  He was fucking jerking off.  Where was Opie?  He is, after all, a black ninja fuckface.  Wow.  Leave it, leave it, leave it.  Leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it.  All right, JJ, we're going to enjoy some Helen Reddy now. 
[01:14:00]  Uh-oh.  If it's not Helen Reddy, I'm going to stab him with a fucking pen.  So it has to be.  Uh-oh.  It sounded a little too twain.  Wait a minute.  I am woman.  Hear me roar.  You got it.  Yeah, that's Helen Reddy.  It's too big to ignore.  And I know too much to go back and pretend.  Cause I've heard it all before.  And I've been down there on the floor. 
[01:14:30]  No one is ever gonna keep me down again.  Everybody.  Yes, I was.  But it's wisdom.  No way.  No way.  This is garbage.  Not me.  No way.  Not once.  Not never.  Not never.  Not once.  Not never.  All right.  You're going to play the whole fucking thing?  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  I'm all about Helen Reddy. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, name another Helen Reddy song, though.  No one here could do that.  I am Quiff.  Smell me roar.  Come on.  Delta Dawn.  Delta Dawn.  Wow.  What's that flower you have on?  That was Helen Reddy.  Yeah.  Delta Dawn.  What's that flower you have on?  Later used in a parody on the Ron and Fez show.  You're a faded rose from days gone by.  What is this?  This is Helen Reddy.  Helen Reddy stinks.  Taking care of the older demos today. 
[01:15:30]  I am woman.  All right.  Enough of the job.  No way, no how.  Fuck you.  We used to sing a song to that song about Crazy John, who used to go behind the House of Beer  in Elwood.  It used to be the International House of Beer.  Why was he called Crazy John?  Because he walked around with a shopping cart and went through the garbage and had a big sunflower.  You know those old sunflowers that used to spin?  He had that on his shopping cart. 
[01:16:00]  And he would go around and he was like, he was definitely like Sling Blade.  And we called him Crazy John because he used to stay behind John's.  And it was John's Bargain Store was in the same shopping center.  And he would always be behind there.  So we called him Crazy John.  And then we wrote the song.  Crazy John.  What's that flower you have on?  Could it be a faded daisy from Daisy's Gone By?  The comedy, even back then, folks.  I was a genius. 
[01:16:30]  Hey, remember that drinking from cups thing?  Drinking from cups.  Can we give the fine people another taste of that?  Because we're trying to get a bit going.  I don't know if it's going to work, but Kevin from Connecticut did send in the first one.  Oh, no.  We want people to attempt to do their version based on the old age show.  Oh, boy.  No?  Not much confidence in this?  No, I hope so.  Can we hear Kevin's?  Yeah, but we need a reference point.  So we need the original for the people that have never heard it. 
[01:17:00]  Drinking from cups.  Drinking from cups.  We try to play just the first 30 seconds of this, but then we end up playing the whole thing.  I know.  Because it's good.  It's too goddamn funny.  All right, here we go.  What does this guy think is an Indian?  Drinking out of cups.  Indian.  What is he, a goddamn asshole?  What the fuck is he doing?  Not ever.  No way.  Now he's Johnny Hammersticks.  Johnny Hammersticks.  Friggin' Tommy Noble.  What the hell is he doing? 
[01:17:30]  Think she's got it going bossing over.  No way.  The lizard's great.  No way.  What is this garbage?  Garbage.  What is this?  Oh, I'm king of the trees.  I'm the tree-meister.

[01:20:00]  I love the one where he goes, bullshit.  Bullshit.  Yeah, of course bullshit.  Everyone in the world would say bullshit to what you just said.  I'm by this floor.  Not once.  Not never.  So, Kevin from Connecticut came over this.  After playing the original, this is going to be a tough spot for you, Kevin.  I'm telling you right now.  Tough spot.  But let's give it a shot.  See what happens.  What does this guy think?  He's an angelfish?  Is he a goddamn asshole?  What the fuck is he doing?  Not ever.  No way.

That's not bad.  He did it all show related, but yet gibberish.  That was pretty good.  Kevin from Connecticut, shitting into cups.  He had the right tone.  Yep.  I liked it.  Gotta tell you.  I liked it.  Funny.  Liked it a lot.  Bullshit.  No way. 
[01:23:00]  No way.  I fucking love that no way shit.  That's quite the thing.  No way.  What do you got?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E to the rock.  What do you got?  Bill Burr.  That's right.  Bill Burr was the first comedian on Conan.  Oh.  Oh, he did that stamp?  He's now a trivia question.  Wow.  He was the first one.  You want to take a little listen? 
[01:23:30]  Damn, yo.  You got the whole set?  Should we just go whole set?  Want to do a whole set?  Yeah.  I'm sure it went well.  A whole set.  Bill Burr on Conan O'Brien last night.  The first stand-up comedian.  That's huge for Mr. Burr.  This is.  Also, I hear he's going to be filming a movie in New York or something.  Really?  I was in the paper yesterday, too.  No way.  Yeah.  Get real.  Yeah.  Everybody right back.  My next guest is a comedian who will be appearing at the Denver Comedy Works from July 23rd to the 25th. 
[01:24:00]  His special, Why Do I Do This?, is now available on DVD and CD.  Please welcome very funny man, Bill Burr.  Thank you.  Jeez, that's a long walk.  I didn't think I was going to make it.  How are you?  Fantastic.  I think I'm slowly going crazy.  I was on YouTube last night for an hour and a half watching people get bit by poisonous snakes. 
[01:24:30]  Just having the time of my life.  You know?  Just screaming at my computer.  That's what you get, you dumb bitch!  You know?  I don't even know what that means.  I do it every single night.  Four hours I spend on YouTube.  This is how I break it down.  The first hour, I watch fat people fall off of stuff.  You know?  Just to take the edge off the day.  Then I watch animals attack people.  Couple of slap fights. 
[01:25:00]  Then I watch conspiracy theory.  I let it marinate all in my head.  And then I go to sleep and have like these Pink Floyd acid trip dreams.  Where Dick Cheney's like half a cat crawling towards me.  Grr!  Grr!  That's why I don't have any kids.  I don't.  I love kids.  But I think it's irresponsible to be a complete maniac.  Not work on yourself.  And then just have a kid.  You know?  And just start downloading all your crazy thoughts onto their pristine little hard drive. 
[01:25:30]  Then you just send them off to school.  They start freaking out the other kids.  You want to play in the sandbox?  My daddy keeps cashing the walls because he doesn't trust banks.  Daddy says they're all whores.  I love kids though.  I like them when they're little.  I don't like when they get a little bit bigger.  You know?  When they start thinking like they know stuff.  You know?  They start sitting.  My buddy's kids like that.  You know?  The other night was standing in the driveway.  I'm like, hey, look at the stars are out.  He goes, actually, that's Jupiter. 
[01:26:00]  Jupiter is your fifth planet.  And I'm like, all right, all right.  Shut up.  Lord, I knew that for a week when I was in fifth grade too.  You know?  I saw a stripper quit on stage two weeks ago.  What are you honestly going to tell me?  Couple of strip club people.  There you go.  I don't know why you'd want to have a kid anyways.  I think they're getting ready to microchip all of us.  You know?  You guys seen that creepy new commercial where they're trying to sell batteries  where that woman can't find her kid in the park? 
[01:26:30]  You know?  What kind of way is that to sell batteries?  Remember back in the day when they would have a battery commercial?  They'd just show some guy in a rainstorm, pulls out a flashlight.  Oh, thank God I had fresh batteries.  I can see how wet I'm getting.  Right?  Now they're showing this woman she can't find her kid in the park.  She's sitting there going, Kevin?  Kevin?  Hey, has anybody seen Kevin?  Sitting there freaking out.  Then she pulls out this little device.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.  And there comes Kevin running out of the woods. 
[01:27:00]  And they're like, Duracell batteries.  I'm like, dude, to hell with the batteries?  What was that thing she just took out of her pocket?  You know?  How did Kevin know to come out of the woods?  He didn't have an antenna.  His speakers weren't glowing.  What the hell is in Kevin?  Don't you show me that like that's normal.  Oh, yeah.  Remote control kid.  Yeah, I must go see mommy.  Dude, that is some psycho New World Order stuff. 
[01:27:30]  I think bankers run the world.  I think that's what it is.  Nerds.  Isn't that depressing?  Nerds run the world.  Remember those kids in fourth grade who'd strike out playing kickball?  Which is literally physically impossible at that age.  The ball's like half the size of your body.  Yet somehow they do it.  You know, big swing and a miss.  Penny loafer flying down the third baseline.  I was having lunch with this girl the other day, right? 
[01:28:00]  Right in the middle of lunch, she looks across the table from me and she goes, um, this is  going to seem oddly racist.  And I was like, all right, this is going to be awesome.  Never heard a conversation started this way.  She's like, um, there are a lot of Asians in this restaurant.  I'm like, that's not racist.  That's an observation.  There are a lot of Asians in this restaurant.  Now, if you were to say, what the hell are all these Asians doing in this restaurant?  That would seem oddly racist. 
[01:28:30]  You still haven't said anything bad about Asians, but you definitely seem to have a problem with  them being in a restaurant, which is odd.  Because I've never heard any bad stereotypes about Asians in restaurants, you know?  Oh, they're taking up all the tables.  Just being all Asian.  I think about killing myself sometimes.  No, it's weird.  You know what? 
[01:29:00]  Because it's never over anything big.  Little things.  Like I thought about killing myself on Thanksgiving, because I said I was going to make a pie.  This is what it was.  Two weeks before Thanksgiving, my girlfriend was all excited.  She's like, Thanksgiving's coming.  I'm going to make a turkey.  I'm going to make stuffing.  What are you going to do?  So I panicked.  I'm like, I'm going to make a pie.  She's like, you can make a pie?  I didn't know you could make a pie.  I'm like, yeah, I'm making the best damn cream pie you ever had.  I don't want to make a pie.  I was just trying to make her leave, right? 
[01:29:30]  So it worked.  No, she walked away totally excited.  I completely forgot about it.  Two weeks later, it's Thanksgiving.  She's like, oh my God, it's Thanksgiving.  You're going to make that pie, right?  You're going to make a pie?  And I was like, oh my God.  I got to go to the grocery store.  I got to buy some flour.  Then I just started thinking, you know, what if I just slam my head right through this plate  glass window and just bled out right down the side of the house?  You know, I wouldn't have to make the pie.  So it's not even like I'm suicidal.  It's more like I'm like lazy.  You know what I mean?  Like whenever I know the next four hours of my life is going to suck, like I think about 
[01:30:00]  it.  Like, oh God, I got to pay my taxes.  It's going to be a long line at the bank.  And then a bus comes by.  What if I just dove head first right behind those double-backed tires?  All right, I'm out of time.  You guys have a lot of fun.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Hey.  That was great.  Thank you, brother.  Bill Burr.  Hilarious.  Thank you so much.  Look at Bill, huh?  Fucking firing those jokes off.  They weren't a great crowd and Bill just took it and really, really turned them around, 
[01:30:30]  man.  Bill's funny, man.  Absolutely.  Really funny.  Very good for Bill Burr.  Very happy for him.  Yeah, that's a great job, man.  Damn.  Goddamn Bill.  Fucking Bill Burr.  Right.  Forget it.  Telling his jokes.  Jokes.  The joke meister.  The joke meister.  He's king of the jokes.  You don't like red hair?  You suck.  All right.  That's fantastic.  A lot of, by the way, a lot of people, I want to just clear this up, are asking me, 
[01:31:00]  like, what is with Florida?  No one's asking that.  Dude, I've gotten, I can't tell you how many emails.  I'm coming.  You might, you know what?  Probably clear it up just by saying it here.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  I will be in Fort Lauderdale on the 18th and the 19th, 20th, West Palm.  It's not all the same place.  Stop being confused.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop.  It's not complicated.  It's two places.  Fright.  You be in Miami?  No.  I'm not. 
[01:31:30]  I was kind of kidding with the setup, but it's amazing the emails you get.  Like, I announced I'm doing Fort Lauderdale on West Palm, and then you get an email, Tampa?  The question mark?  No.  No.  Like, what proximity makes it appropriate to ask?  Anything below Mason Dixon?  Georgia?  Fucking dude.  No, I'm not doing Jacksonville.  I won't.  So you're doing Jacksonville and Tampa?  Yes, I am.  Okay, good.  But I'm doing one Tuesday, September 8th, and then I'm doing one on New Year's Eve. 
[01:32:00]  Okay.  And I guarantee I'll get an email about that.  Dude, were you kidding?  Yes.  So what's the real info?  Now I'm confused.  Fort Lauderdale on West Palm.  There you go.  June 17th through 19th.  Very good.  We never got the home run call from John Sterling.  Yeah, where is that?  I don't want to hear that.  That ain't a good sign.  It's not Danny's responsibility.  Dan is in studio here.  I'm sure Sam's looking forward to that.  They're still trying to find it?  Yeah, I mean, it could have been anyway, especially when it's just so broad like that.  All right.  Do we know what you don't know what any of it is? 
[01:32:30]  Sam's looking for it.  Let me say hi to Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Hey, Tom.  Welcome aboard, Thomas.  Hey, Tom.  How are you?  Happy birthday, Yimmy.  Aw.  Hey, did you guys catch that he slipped in the word cream pie into his set?  Well, cream pie is a cream pie.  I don't think he was trying to be, like, silly with it.  Yeah, I don't think he was.  It's just a cream pie.  I think he's the best cream pie you ever.  Oh, you know what?  Maybe Bill is a bowl preparer and doesn't even know it. 
[01:33:00]  Bill likes to prep bowls.  He has no idea.  Subliminal.  Prep and bowls, right.  Yeah, right.  Don't fuck my girl.  No way, no how.  No way.  No how.  No way.  What are you, the cummeister?  No way.  Somebody sent me a clip that, oh, what the fuck is it?  I think it's from the office.  They were talking about cuckolding.  Really?  Yes.  I'll find the link.  I got it on my email or something.  Oh, there's a video I want to turn you guys on to.  Another video. 
[01:33:30]  It's cracking up.  Philly fuck.  It's an elephant.  If you go to my Twitter and go down a little bit.  Is that MySpace and Twitter?  MySpace.  What did I say?  My Twitter.  My Twitter.  Oh, MyTwitter, yeah.  But you're Twitter.  Go down a little bit.  A little bit.  There's a video a little further.  It was from The Weeknd.  The Weeknd?  From Philly.  Fuck, I think.  Keep going.  Heather, that was...  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Have you guys seen this video yet?  I don't know.  I know.  No.  I was just a set-up.  Ricky?  My...  Listen to Ricky.  Kelsey.  You manipulate me.  Oh, no.  You manipulate my mind.  You manipulate my heart.  Oh, boy.  You tell me...  How?  Can you pause this?  We might have to start over.  You're the one.  What is this guy's fucking story?  Well, you don't really...  We could give you the visual very easy. 
[01:34:30]  He's on a webcam.  Very pissed off because I guess his girlfriend did him wrong.  He's a lunatic.  He has crazy eyes, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Short black hair, kind of a goatee thing happening.  Exactly.  Dark eyes that are just crazy.  He looks like Steve wants to look.  And he is not happy.  He's got wood paneling and horrible drapes behind him.  He's obviously living with...  I would say grandma, not even mom.  And he talks to, I think, what is his ex. 
[01:35:00]  Here we go.  Poor girl.  To help me get through my dad's death.  You were there for me.  Oh, boy.  How...  I promised my dad that he would meet the girl of my future before he dies.  Holy shit.  And that you were the one.  Wide eyes into the camera.  And then...  Looking away from the camera.  Today...  You have the audacity to go out with someone else. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, shit.  After telling me that you were falling back in love with me.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  That shit don't fly with me.  Ooh, no, huh?  Don't talk.  I may have been dating Jess.  I didn't love her, and you knew that.  Yeah.  Use your fucking mind.  What a bad actor.  Right.  Of course you don't have one.  Ooh.  They're too fucked up with drugs and alcohol.  And all the other poisoning. 
[01:36:00]  You go out with someone who you said raped you.  What?  The ex-habway champ?  You keep getting your heart broke, and you keep going back to the same guy.  Same guys over and over and over.  At least I don't do that.  Yeah.  I'm not gay.  The fact is, you want to manipulate my mind?  You want to manipulate my heart?  You want to try and break me down?  Yeah.  It's not going to happen. 
[01:36:30]  I'm a lot smarter than that.  I'm a lot smarter than a lot of people give me credit for.  Uh-oh.  Are you?  I'm smart.  But if you want to try and destroy me, and go that low, say, oh, I love you.  I'm falling back in love with you.  And you're not.  He's like cockeyed.  Yeah, he's awful.  Do me a favor.  You do those drugs.  You do that alcohol.  You end up dead. 
[01:37:00]  And you burn.  Burn.  In.  Hell.  Rest.  In.  Peace.  Bitch.  How fucking embarrassing.  And that's, now that's forever.  The teeth clenched.  Yeah.  Can we please hear the end quote again?  He's like, rest.  In.  There he goes.  This is clenched teeth. 
[01:37:30]  He's trying to be.  And you burn.  Burn.  In.  Hell.  Hell.  Rest.  In.  Peace.  Bitch.  Shit.  Louie beans.  What else does he have up, daddy?  He's a lunatic.  His name's Ricky.  But I was off of some guys.  It's not his own, uh, it's not his own post.  It's from, uh, his Facebook page. 
[01:38:00]  Uh-huh.  What do you think?  I think he's, uh, unstable.  You can see it in his eyes, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, like anybody could act like that, I guess.  But, uh, he's got those crazy eyes that just make him crazy.  He can get wide, then he's clenching his teeth.  And one goes one way, one goes the other.  Crazy.  He tries to, uh, look away from the webcam a few times.  Yeah, he can't.  He's cock-eyed.  Yeah, he's doing bad actor things.  Yeah.  But you don't think that's fake, do you, Jimmy? 
[01:38:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  Because you said he's a bad actor.  Oh, no, I mean, not that he's a bad actor in the video.  But when he says he's looking away and looking back, when he's trying to be dramatic, it doesn't work with me.  But obviously, it works perfectly well with him.  Of course.  Of course it works with him.  Burn.  In.  Hell.  He thinks he's, um, yeah, he, I think he, he looked at it and looks at, like, actors and sees what they do and tried to emulate that.  You know, very poor job. 
[01:39:00]  I couldn't see where his hands were.  See if he was a good actor.  Unfortunately, they went on a gun.  In his mouth.  Yes.  Let's go to Sergio in New York.  Sergio.  Sergio.  Good evening.  Hey.  That guy who just did that rendering sounds like primetime Sam.  Maybe he can do a, you know, read it, read it, read it out.  Some people said it sounded like Ron Howard.  Gamer dad said Ron Howard.  Uh, let's go to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad.  Hey, boys, you gotta get Ricky on the show.  He's my new hero. 
[01:39:30]  He's awesome.  You like Ricky?  He's hilarious, dude.  He's pushing out.  He's hilarious.  He seems a little dangerous.  I don't think I'd like to have him around.  No.  Get out of here.  Uh, best rant of all time.  Filthy fucking rant by Earl Weaver.  Yeah, we've played that many times over the years.  Maybe we could squeeze it in today for Mark Patch in Boston.  Hear what a Yankee fan did in Boston?  Uh.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Let me think.  Anyone?  It might be on this one.  Um, a Yankee fan. 
[01:40:00]  Was it something good?  Something with the green monster, I think.  Yes.  Green monster.  Throw himself off of it?  I'm trying to figure out, I didn't feel like reading the whole story, but why would I?  Ron Valeri taught me, you read the first two lines of any story, and then you got pretty  much the whole story.  Try it at home.  Add the details yourself.  Try it at home.  It kind of works.  If anybody needs to know any more than that, you just make it up.  Or the first paragraph, I think he said.  First paragraph.  I would hope it's the first paragraph. 
[01:40:30]  And then the rest of it is just filler.  Filler.  Of the story that they just told you in the first paragraph.  You would just want to know who, what, when, why.  I guess a Yankee fan decided to get some grass seeds from Yankee Stadium, I think.  That might have been in, you know, more of the paragraphs that I didn't read.  Yeah, right.  He put in a baggie, put some water in the baggie, and then he was at a Red Sox game, and he  might have been hanging out around the green monster or so, and threw it onto the field,  hoping that just one seed from Yankee Stadium starts growing at Fenway. 
[01:41:00]  Ah.  And that actually made the news today.  What a nut.  Can you give me the paper?  Maybe I should read this one.  I don't know which paper is it in.  I don't know either, Jimmy.  I don't know.  What a dumb sentiment that is.  It really is.  Give me the paper while you rank, because I've got to find the whole thing.  It really is.  Because I knew this would bother you.  I just have had enough of baseball, and I've had enough.  Why?  What's wrong with baseball, Jimmy?  I'm sick of the baseball purist fucking bellyaching about steroids, and I'm sick and tired of 
[01:41:30]  bellyaching of these traditions, and so, hey, I buried the jersey in Yankee Stadium.  They don't.  Shut up.  I'm tired of bellyaching.  Well, I guess he's getting the Red Sox back for the guy that buried the Red Sox jersey in  the Yankee Stadium.  Oh, it's a fun rivalry.  I think that's what this is about.  Let me try to find a story.  Why don't you take a big dump in the shape of an N and a Y on a home plate?  You want to make a statement at Fenway?  That's what you do.  Shit the Yankee logo. 
[01:42:00]  That's a statement.  Yeah.  I think we would pay a lot of money for that, Jimmy.  First person to shit the Yankee logo at Fenway.  Wins.  I might have to go to the second paper, so this could take a minute.  Yeah, so talk them on yourselves.  What?  It is?  All right.  What section?  The sports?  Must be, right?  Do you think they'll replace my fucking exploded battery?  No.  Yes.  They better.  Will they ask me when it was from?  Yeah, probably.  How old is it? 
[01:42:30]  Might be a couple years.  But even if it's old, should it do this?  Never.  I don't care how old it is.  You shouldn't have a problem.  It shouldn't explode.  That's ridiculous.  It's crazy.  Exploding batteries.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put it back in your laptop.  No way, no how.  Fucking, no way.  It's the battery hands.  No way.  Why read when we got a guy that read for us?  Tim in Boston.  Tim, what do you got on this story?  The guy actually was at the fish concert last weekend, and he did it.  He's a lifelong Yankees fan. 
[01:43:00]  He thought it would be funny.  He's from Vermont.  But who reported it?  Yeah, why is it a story?  It's page two down here, by the way.  Page two in the paper.  Two.  Let me read.  Stay on the line to help us out, Tim.  The Yankees will have home field advantage at Fenway Park tonight, thanks to one fan's  grassroots effort to sabotage the Red Sox.  I get it.  I didn't know you could, you could like put grass puns into a news story.  Yeah.  Amazing. 
[01:43:30]  Let's see.  Oh, that's why the headline says, Yank fan puts green monster in Fenway.  See?  See, because it's a green.  It's literally a monster, because it's grass from Yankee Stadium.  Ian Ferris, a Bombers fan in the heart of Red Sox Nation, green-thumbed his nose.  How many fucking puns?  What the fuck?  Who wouldn't write this shit?  They are really, really trying for the puns.  I think that's three or four already.  A little too hard.  Puns are awful.  Green-thumbed his nose at Boston by planting Yankee Stadium grass in the Fenway infield during 
[01:44:00]  the May 31st fish concert.  Yankee Stadium grass seeds went on sale this year.  Ferris hid the seeds in his pants as he entered Fenway, filled the bag with water, and tossed  it onto the infield.  This is payback, said Ferris, who manages a Hooters in Vermont.  I've had seed in my pants.  And then it said, if even one blade of grass sprouts in the field, I feel it was a success.  It wasn't.  It was a dismal, boring failure. 
[01:44:30]  Where your grass is, it's all over some hippie's foot in the parking lot.  A bunch of dopey fish fans.  They all stepped on it and carried it out with them.  Killed it.  And smoked it.  You know what's weird, though?  And back me up, Tim.  You guys are such lunatics up there that I bet you they replaced the infield grass now.  They probably don't.  They're going to have to.  Yeah.  Well, I was there on Saturday at the game, and they actually walked through the infield  and picked up anything that isn't the grass.  So I'm sure they already pulled it out.  They don't know which blade it is, Tim.  They actually have five guys that walk through and pick the lint out of the grass, so I'm 
[01:45:00]  sure they pulled it out.  They pulled what out?  Seeds?  They're seeds with water.  What do you think?  They drain the water, too?  Yeah, they walk with a hair dryer.  They didn't just throw the whole baggie down there.  Yeah, he kind of like emptied the baggie.  You reckon they put a piece of sod down?  Give it a whoosh.  A willful boy in Jersey writes, page two is on page one of my Denny's placemat.  Oh, wow.  So that's good.  Denny's placemat.  Let me say hi to Cindy in Jersey. 
[01:45:30]  Cindy.  Cindy.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  My boyfriend and I went to the Dave Matthews fan concert at Fenway Park two weekends ago.  God, that sounds fun.  Wow.  I'm not a big Dave Matthews fan.  Hold on.  Hold on, Cindy, because I like where you're going, but I want to...  I don't know when Sony does.  What I've heard of him, I thought he was, it was like listening to fucking, to lead settle.  It was just dull.  What would you say?  Can I have a little Dave Matthews fan? 
[01:46:00]  No, Willie Nelson opened.  That was a little worse.  No, Willie Nelson still rocks.  Yeah, to all the girls he's loved before.  Willie Nelson has dementia.  Like, he's lucky he remembered the lyrics to his own song.  Nope, he's right here.  He smokes a lot of pot.  Anyway, with the green monster, it was definitely accessible, and everybody was all over it.  My boyfriend's shtick is to moon everybody everywhere, like he's notorious with his friends for pulling his pants down.  So we're standing against the green monster, him being a lifelong Yankee fan, and leaning against him, and he goes, don't move. 
[01:46:30]  I was like, why?  What's the matter?  I thought, like, there was a bug on me or something, being that I'm a chick.  He's like, don't move.  And I feel him moving around.  Next thing I know, he's wiping his ass against the green monster, and he's like, that was the all-time best moment of my life ever.  But he didn't warn me so I could get a picture of it.  Meanwhile, there's dirty cleat marks, and he's rubbing his asshole where all these fucking men's knees are.  Exactly.  Guys have spit tobacco there.  Yeah, but he's that much of a Yankee fan.  He could care less.  He does what he said if he knew he was going to have the opportunity. 
[01:47:00]  Like, he went in a wig for a week just to make it even worse.  So you're saying he wasn't able to get a smudge on the actual wall?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  He probably tried his best, but I was blocking the view of the bodyguards and security and all that, so we didn't get thrown out.  But unfortunately, I couldn't get a picture because I didn't know what was going to happen.  How was the show?  The show was phenomenal.  How long did Dave Matthews play for?  He plays forever.  About three hours.  Ah!  Oh, wow.  Can I hear a little? 
[01:47:30]  I don't know what I've heard.  You know Dave Matthews, Jimmy.  Doesn't mean you like or search it out.  What song is this?  This is What Would You Say?  What Would You Say?  All right.  Yeah.  The beginning throw, Mabel.  Sounds a little like the Spin Doctors.  A little bit.  In the beginning, right?  This is atrocious.  This is boring.  What's boring about it?  It's just like nice.  Harmonica.  It's fucking awful. 
[01:48:00]  Ah!  It fucking blows.  Jimmy loves it.  What's wrong with this?  The fact...  What's right with it?  It doesn't hurt anyone.  Fucking heinous.  The fact...  We're just going to get to the hook for you, Jimmy.  A lifetime is past you by. 
[01:48:30]  Juicy!  Oh yeah, I've heard this.  Sounds like fucking music that lawyers enjoy.  This is lawyer music.  That's, you know...  It's exactly right.  They loosen their fucking ties.  Getting a little crazy on the weekends?  Yeah.  This is like lawyer or fucking office guy music.  It's atrocious.  Is it not your top 10, Jimmy?  I'm sorry, sweetheart?  Is it not your top 10?  No, it's not my...  What?  You ever go to a barbecue where you don't know people and like the real conservative guy 
[01:49:00]  shows up with his casual outfit, but it was so not casual.  It was like so planned out to be casual.  You'd tell he's still the stuffed shirt.  Right.  It's a tuxedo with a dildo on the outside.  Or a strap-on.  Like everyone else is just kind of wearing like long shorts and whatever, some t-shirts,  and he has his casual like, look, I can be cool too, guys.  What's another big Dave Matthews song?  Well, Crash...  I have heard that hook.  A little Crash Into Me or whatever that fucking song is. 
[01:49:30]  Crush.  Crash Into Me.  No, Travis, we just heard this.  Every day.  This is another song?  Yes.  Yes.  A little planking guitar.  Yeah.  He's got a new album out.  He was promoted.  Oh, thank God.  You weren't into Dave Matthews either there?  No.  No. 
[01:50:00]  Sounds like that other guy.  Into your heart.  Right, the heart.  Enough with the fucking heart.  What's wrong with the heart?  Everything.  I'm sick of it.  There's not a lot of songs about the heart.  Fucking boring cracker sentiments.  Into your heart.  Bunch of fucking, bunch of fucking medical assistants enjoying this.  This is a bunch of dentists.  This is great.  To your heart.  Dentists.  It's fucking awful.  Put the radio and your sob up and play this. 
[01:50:30]  You don't like...  Sob, really?  You don't like songs about the heart in general?  I don't fucking...  I loathe them.  You do?  I loathe them.  All right, Cindy.  I'm going to move on to a lawyer who is offended by Jimmy.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  Jimmy, I am so offended.  How could you say something like that about lawyers?  You're not a Dave Matthews fan?  No, I am not.  I apologize.  Thank you.  I apologize to all lawyers.  Hi, John.  All right. 
[01:51:00]  Let's say hi to Tom in Jersey.  He's a lawyer, and you love Dave Matthews?  Good evening.  Hey, what's up, Tom?  I love Dave Matthews, man.  I've been to about 30 shows.  All my lawyer friends have been to about 30 shows.  We love Dave Matthews, man.  Jimmy hit it right on the head.  He's absolutely right.  And I'm ashamed.  How does Jimmy know this stuff?  I'm ashamed.  I just sense it.  You just sense the fact that lawyers would like Dave Matthews?  It's just the type of music that you can just pick them, kick them back to a beer, and 
[01:51:30]  kind of listen to the words.  Oh, this one's a cool one.  It's not a cool one.  No.  It's like every shitty fucking beer commercial, guys letting their hair down.  Fucking stinks.  I know.  I love to get angry, Jimmy.  The angry part just makes me very happy.  It's just like, ah, it's not for me.  He just gets really annoyed.  Yeah.  As they get fucking their barbecues, they get a little drunk, they crank this up. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're having a good time, Jim.  They sure are.  Just having a good old time.  Good friends, good times.  Right.  Someone nods and they hold up their fucking imported beer.  Let's go to Roy in New York.  Roy?  Yes.  Hey, Roy.  Stop playing, like, stuff from 20 years ago.  What?  These are the hits.  What do you want from me?  Yeah.  Sorry the guy hasn't had a hit in 20 years.  If we're going to talk about Dave Matthews, you've got to play the hits for Jimmy, because  he doesn't even know the band.  Yeah, Roy. 
[01:52:30]  He's got new hits.  This shit's dark.  What's a new hit?  Play Bartender.  Play Bartender.  Hey, Bartender, make me a drink.  You've got to have it.  All right, I'll play Bartender.  Is it like that?  What are you drinking?  Come, Papa.  Is this Bartender?  Yeah, it's got a long intro.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  And he wants us to play new stuff.  This song is seven years old. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You just said play new stuff, and you just told us to play a song that's seven years old.  Seven years old?  Newer than the other shit.  All right.  Okay, by two years.  Oh, really?  The other stuff was nine years old, this is seven years old?  The last time Dave Matthews had a big hit was probably around, yeah, 2002, 2004.  Hold on.  One day I know it's a day.  One day I know it's a day.  Do you either love him or hate him?  There's no one between.  Hold on.  This is it.  Oh. 
[01:53:30]  It's like the soundtrack of a 90s movie.  I'm sounding more and more like Peter Gabriel, huh?  Yeah, look at that.  That's his band?  It's so dark.  Yeah, that's his band, Jimmy.  Look, it's that guy with dreadlocks.  He likes the brothers.  He's got a few brothers in his band.  And Kevin Bacon next to him?  One of the Bacon brothers.  Who's that one black guy with a long face?  That is the ugliest band I've ever seen. 
[01:54:00]  Next to Dave Matthews.  The three ugliest black guys in the country are in the Dave Matthews band.  The white guys are actually Dave Matthews.  I don't want to fuck them.  I just want to listen to what Dave Matthews is.  One guy's dead, you know.  The one guy looks like...  Yeah, which guy died?  His saxophone side.  What did he do?  Of course, saxophone.  Fucking...  Of course, there's a sax player.  He's depressed.  Look at the long face.  The guy in the middle kind of looks like Eminem.  Dave Matthews has a fucking giant skull.  His head gets bigger as you go up.  It's awful.  His hairline's receding a bit there. 
[01:54:30]  Well, he's in the fourth side of the photo, Jimmy.  It doesn't matter.  His head was bigger than the rest of the guy.  He's not that close.  It's not a Google fucking earth image.  Then he's also seven foot tall, too.  Is he that big?  No, but look.  He's so much taller than everyone, too.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you for trying.  Oh, his fucking over-the-shoulder look.  This thoughtful glance.  We get this phone call every time we talk about music.  Let's go to Jeremy and Charlotte.  Jimmy doesn't know what he's talking about.  Jeremy.  Here we go.  Well, because it's not Gene Simmons. 
[01:55:00]  It's not a good band, Jimmy.  No, I'll accept criticism of Gene.  Because Kiss is wicked awesome.  Well, Kiss is not what we're talking about.  We're talking about Dave Matthews.  Kiss knows better than to play for three hours.  And they don't have the three ugliest black guys in the country in their band.  Dude, I saw better-looking guys in Oz.  That's fucking...  They're awful band members.  Do you know how many songs Kiss would have to play if they played for three hours?  Every song is, what, three minutes long?  Exactly.  They get to the point.  That would be...  They would have to play 60 songs.  Right?  Wait, is that true? 
[01:55:30]  Wait, 320, 2020, right?  60 songs.  Roland has just texted me.  Yeah, what did he say?  Dave Matthews, this is the music you play when you find out you just got AIDS.  Bruce!  There you go.  I'm such a Springsteen fan.  Yeah, and a couple of Springsteen songs I'm really starting to love, but I don't like  his high-energy stuff.  Bound, bound, bound, glory days.  It's terrible.  Glory days.  However, Youngstown I love.  The hitter I love.  I like his weird, slow shit. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah?  A lot.  You like the song from The Wrestler?  I'd have to hear it again, but like, Philadelphia's a fucking amazing song.  What about it?  It's droning and boring.  In my hometown.  I like that.  In my hometown.  You're right.  What about Tunnel of Love?  I don't know that one.  Let's go to Brian in Maryland.  Tunnel of Love.  Brian.  Hey, what's up, guys?  It sounds like Adam Sandler singing.  What, Dave Matthews?  Yeah.  And I think the saxophone player's dead. 
[01:56:30]  He's dead.  Coil, poil, spook.  What happened to the sax player?  Jesus.  I don't know.  Probably heard he was on something.  I don't know.  I heard he's dead.  God.  This guy just lost his mind.  Was he sick or was it like...  Hey, Jimmy, I love...  Got an axe in the chest when he went to the Overlook.  What's that, sir?  I love, love a meaty pussy, Jimmy.  I like it to look like a ham sandwich.  Yeah, I do, too, man.  I like a fucking...  Oh, roast beef.  Yeah.  I like cold cuts.  He sure does. 
[01:57:00]  All right, let's go to...  You know what?  It should look like a Subway sandwich that a truck has just run over.  It should look like a fucking three-meat Subway sandwich that a truck has run over.  That's a little too much, you know?  A disemboweled sandwich.  Sandwiches.  Sandwiches.  Sandwich.  Chad and P.A.  Hey, you guys realize you're probably going to get spent hours to be for this one again.  They've got...  Channel 56 has Dave Matthews Radio right now, and they've been promoting the shit out of  it on your channel. 
[01:57:30]  Dude, there's nothing I'm going to say that's going to affect Dave Matthews' popularity.  This guy's massive.  They're promoting the shit out of the Dave Matthews channel on our fine channel?  I know he sucks.  You know he sucks, but it's everywhere.  They're promoting it on your channel on Raw Dog.  I know that's the only two things I've listened to.  What would management say?  Oh, no.  I bet they'd be angry.  They sure would be, Anthony.  They sure would be.  All right, just got to the office punching out, boys.  God, imagine if all of a sudden I just trashed Dave Matthews for three minutes and his record 
[01:58:00]  sales plunged.  If I had that kind of power, do you know what a cunt that would be?  Of course.  Let's go to Keith and we'll have to keep doing it.  To everyone.  Even people I like, I would just boss around.  I'd trash Ozzy, watch his fucking record sales go down, then make myself a hero, like  bringing him back up.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That's Jim's dream.  No kidding.  It's like being hugged by Kiss.  I think that's an actual dream, yeah.  Keith in Louisville.  Hey, yeah.  I got drugged at one of these concerts last year. 
[01:58:30]  I figured it out about halfway through.  One minute into every song, it sounds exactly the same.  And that black guy, he looks just like Barbaro, the horse that won the derby.  He really is.  What a long, thin head that guy has.  Wow, Keith.  We might have to bring Line of the Day back just for Keith, because that would be right  up there.  What does sax player die?  I have to know.  He's like the fatter guy, right?  ATV accident last year.  Oh, really?  That's what Joe in Baltimore is saying. 
[01:59:00]  What the fuck did he hit?  I don't know.  Maybe Dave Matthews' big head, because you said it's so big.  No, but he's kind of like, he has those old guy, black guy dreads.  Like when black guys are going bald, a lot of times they'll let dreads grow in.  Yeah.  Because it's a way of kind of covering area.  And it's like gray on the bottom.  Corey in Ohio.  Corey?  What's up, O?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Hey, you guys just don't understand.  Dave Matthews is some pussy getting music.  The ladies love Dave.  Probably right. 
[01:59:30]  Let's go with this a little bit.  Name some other artists that are pussy getting music.  Merciful Fate.  I play that really loud.  I'll say, look, if you suck my dick, I'll turn it off.  You can't beat Dave, man.  Half of his music is about getting pussy.  Especially Crash Into Me.  That's nothing but getting pussy.  You know what, Corey? 
[02:00:00]  He's making a pretty good point, I'm thinking.  Well, back in the day, I was dragged to a Jackson Brown concert.  Is that pussy getting music?  Ed gave it up.  I think it was.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was a pussy for going.  What about Jack Johnson?  Pussy getting music?  You could call me Jack Johnson.  Is that pussy getting music?  What's his song?  I don't know.  What does he do?  Well, Travis, you want to help me out with a little Jack Johnson?  Please, Travis.  He's got that surfer thing going.  For once.  A little surfer.  I don't know if you could even call it rock, because he's on the softer side. 
[02:00:30]  What is it?  Does it have got vocals?  You know Jack Johnson.  I'm going to listen to James Blunt through a megaphone.  Oh, that guy.  James Blunt is beautiful.  That's pussy getting music, though.  Yeah, it is.  The girls eat that shit up.  They eat that shit up.  This is Jack Johnson.  Oh, you know where I saw this guy?  I saw him at Bonnaroo.  Okay, that's where I know the name.  Did you like him?  I was doing interviews and stuff.  I didn't watch him.  Bonnaroo.  This is Dave Matthews. 
[02:01:00]  It's pussy getting music.  Corey is right.  It's background white guy music.  If regular radio was smart, they would have a whole fucking station just dedicated to  pussy getting music.  All their sweepers would be that, too.  Pussy getting music.  C-W-C-U.  I know this song.  You know this one?  Yeah, yeah.  Now it's ringing a bell.  Would you listen to this if it popped on something, or would you turn the channel?  I'd probably turn the channel.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Why bother?  You know what?  We're going to help Jim Norton out.  Jenny in Louisiana is going to help you out.  Okay.  You might appreciate Dave Matthews after this next phone call.  Jenny, go ahead.  Hey, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Jenny.  A couple of years ago, the Dave Matthews tour bus.  I don't know what city it was in, but it was going over a bridge.  Yeah.  They accidentally dumped the whole shitter on this whole ferry full of people.  Oh, right.  I remember that. 
[02:02:00]  On a ferry filled with people.  I think it was like one of those little tourist fairies.  They got fined a bunch of money from the city for doing that.  You got to like Dave Matthews now, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I sit in Dave Matthews.  How do you do that by accident?  There was somebody that said, you know what?  Watch this.  Yeah.  I didn't remember hearing about that.  There's no fucking way that was by accident.  Yep.  Later.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Bye, Jenny.  Let me say hi to Mike in New York.  Mike.  Mike.  Good evening.  Stupid. 
[02:02:30]  It really is.  Good evening.  This guy's the greatest.  Yeah.  You guys hit it right on the head.  Me, I grew up in Westchester, you know, me and all my friends, you know, prep school up,  bringing total stereotypical, you know, after-school special stuff, sitting around, you know, smoking  and listening to Dave Matthews.  Every single one of us now works like in finance, IT, total white-collar office douchebags.  So you guys absolutely nailed it.  And the saxophonist, I believe, died from an ATV accident. 
[02:03:00]  That's one of those all-terrain vehicles.  He just must have flipped it over and broke his neck or something?  Something like that.  But you guys are great.  You know, I actually wrote wow on the back of my Humvee in Iraq.  And I would have Army guys walk up to me and be like, you're an opening Anthony, that's  awesome.  That's great.  The local women were flashing their eyes and noses.  Love it.  You guys are great.  I absolutely love you.  You absolutely rock.  Thank you.  When you guys went off here a little while ago, I stopped listening to my radio. 
[02:03:30]  Like, it just, it sucks.  If you guys, if you ever went off the radio, I literally don't know what I would do with  myself.  Well, I appreciate that, Mike.  Thank you.  You guys rock.  And we need a new angle on that wow thing.  It's just sitting there.  It's still happening.  But we need a new angle.  It's just tough to do it when you do morning radio.  Yeah.  It was perfect when we were doing afternoons.  Perfect.  Seal.  Pussy getting music?  Seal.  I don't know.  Not for me. 
[02:04:00]  Here's one.  We talk about it on the show a lot.  Not a lot, but it comes up.  Michael.  Oh, Michael.  Michael.  Michael.  Michael.  Michael.  Play.  The women love Michael.  Michael.  Play.  You put on some Michael play and they get moist instantly.  Dave Matthew Band is frat and sorority music.  Is that true?  And what do we know?  Seal.  Pussy getting music.  What?  How many songs did he have?  I mean.  Kiss from a Rose.  And what else?  Seal.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  One good song from the shitty Batman 2 and the rest of it is nonsense.  Kiss from a Rose.  Right.  The Penguin.  We know.  What else?  This is a great song, but what else?  I would call it a great song.  I like this.  It's catchy.  It's this.  It's a seal.  Oh, right.  Kiss from a Rose.  I know this one.  Didn't he just rework another one of his hits to make this song?  Probably.  I think.  Yeah.  Let me say how to Matt in Jamestown.  Matt.  Ain't no cunt huge.  Huge.  So a chick song you get pussy with. 
[02:05:00]  Ain't no cunt was a band that wasn't thinking properly.  They weren't thinking about like getting popular.  Promotion, marketing, anything.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a band that could truly say, look, we're not in this to be famous.  Right.  And have a huge sellout audience.  Obviously.  Because what would they do if all of a sudden they started making hit records?  Well, for a while, people were just calling them AC if you tried to reference them on  the radio.  Remember?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, you know, AC.  Oh, anal cunt?  Let's really wake up these fuckers.  Do we have anal cunt in the master computer, Travis?  Anal cunt.  No way.  We have so much anal cunt.  For real?  Oh, yeah.  And they have the greatest names for their songs.  Yeah.  Read some of the names of anal cunt's music.  You guys decide what you want.  I'll read some names.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Look.  Sandra Bernhardt.  Wow, I know that time's a bitch, but holy shit.  Oh, my God.  That's plastic surgery gone wrong right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Something's happening.  Dude, I've always thought she was sexy. 
[02:06:00]  I really...  Sandra Bernhardt is...  She's a little older now, but I've always thought she was super sexy.  That's weird.  Her face is bloated.  What's happening?  There's something going on.  There's definitely something going on with Sandra Bernhardt.  I love the gap in RT.  That, to me, fucking...  When a girl has a little gap like that, I love it.  I had a crush for years on The Waitress with a little gap like that.  Then she got it fixed, and I punched it out.  Jimmy, your old friend makes Pussy Getting Music.  Did the show once.  Sully?  John Mayer. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, yeah, of course.  J.M.  Yeah.  Pussy Getting Music.  He gets all the pussy.  Yeah, he does.  John also has a giant head, though.  But, yeah, he fucking...  Box swirls to him.  Anal cunt opened up for Pantera at the Worcester Centrum.  Are we going to get to hear some Anal cunt?  Oh, yeah.  So what are some of the songs?  Why don't it be all nice names like Sunday Surprise, Blueberry Medley, A Rose for My Dear.  A Rose for My Dear.  It's A Rose for My Dear, a little band called Anal cunt. 
[02:07:00]  Would You Be Mine, You Goose?  Go ahead.  Hitler was a sensitive man.  I fucked your wife.  I gave Nambla pictures of your kids.  I got an office job for the sole purpose of sexually harassing.  I intentionally ran over your dog.  One of my favorite songs, I Just Saw the Gayest Guy on Earth.  Of course you did.  You sing it to a mirror.  That song's hilarious.  Did someone ask for me?  I opened the door.  Perfectly squiggy. 
[02:07:30]  Hello.  Hello.  He just walked right in.  Yes, I have sunglasses on my head.  I lit your baby on fire.  A swish.  Sorry.  All right.  A swish.  A swish.  A swish.  We have a very important job here.  We need the Anal cunt.  To suck and we're doing it.  We need the Anal cunt fans to call.  We're going to play one song that represents this band.  What song is it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I like how all the songs are, I did something.  They have a song called Radio Hit.  That's probably their big hit. 
[02:08:00]  I wouldn't want to hear that.  So then we do Afternoon Delight.  Kevin from Connecticut once again saying that.  It's not in Delight.  I think it was.  I know they did a death metal version of the A-Team theme song.  Oh, really?  Now they have a song.  The only reason men talk to you is because they want to get laid, you stupid fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Let's play that.  They're playing a Sandra Bernhardt clip from King of Comedy right there.  She was really kissable, man.  Is she gay or no?  I think so.  She's really sexy, man.  How miserable is Jerry Lewis in this? 
[02:08:30]  Jerry is wrapped in tape.  Oh, wait.  Here we go.  We got some AC for everybody.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC.  A little AC. 
[02:09:00]  A little AC.  Jimmy's so fucking annoying.  Jimmy's disgusted.  Why?  Why?  Because it's fucking idiocy.  Why is it?  The music is fine.  Why is it idiocy?  It is.  I can't even say the word.  Why?  Why is it that word you used?  I don't know.  It's just nonsense.  No one can listen to this cigar.  That makes sense.  Why?  There are people that enjoy this.  They continue to make music.  Again, the music is fine. 
[02:09:30]  I would love to just put that on during a nice candlelit dinner with a girl like the first  time you ever met her.  Well, the next time a girl goes...  Is she pregnant?  Is that why she's getting weight?  She has to be pregnant.  Is that Rachel Ray?  No, no.  That's Suki.  Who's Suki?  Suki or something.  She tells the news over there.  I don't know who Suki is.  She is?  She's on Jules' channel.  Well, I don't know who she is.  Ant.  You know how you get into a situation every once in a while and you're setting up something  and then you go, hey, you want to hear? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, I'm going to put some music on.  What do you want to hear?  And they go, eh, whatever you want.  All right.  Then you grab the anal cunt.  You grab a little anal cunt and you throw it on.  They have a 22-second song called Van Full of Retards.  All right, let's listen to this.  Van Full of Retards.  Let me guess.  Blah, blah, blah!  Retards, blah!  Retards, dumb!  Blah!  Let me guess.  Let me guess.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!  Maybe you're going to say blah, blah, blah!  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!  All right, let's play our new game.  We give you the title of an anal cunt song, Jimmy, and you tell us how it goes. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, they'll all be that way.  Well, let's see if this one is like that.  Maybe Travis should play an anal cunt song and then Jimmy has the title.  Okay, yeah.  All right.  Let me hear the retards then.  Well, I'm going to hear the retards song.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's it.  Wow.  What bugs me about them is their song titles are too funny. 
[02:11:00]  It's almost like the whole point is just to get a funny song title so they can go look  and read the back of the album.  It's like, who gives a fuck?  And then because all the songs just go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Dark, dark.  Ooh, the devil.  Ooh.  Rebecca Marshall from Jersey writes, you guys rule AC at 8.45 a.m. with Oney. 
[02:11:30]  with ONA.  Supposedly they do a Hootie and the Blowfish  remake. I'm sure it's crazy.  It's funny how they call themselves anal cunt instead of  ass cunt. They go with the proper name  for anus. Fucking douchebags.  They kind of want mainstream  success, but they don't.  Look, if we say anal, maybe  MTV will pick up our video.  Maybe they'll bail out before they get the cunt and they'll think  we're legitimate.  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.  You don't like it? 
[02:12:00]  It stinks to high heaven.  What are you going to play for us next, Travis?  Well, I don't have a Hootie and the Blowfish song, but I do have the theme  from Three's Company.  Oh, they do the theme from...  Wait for you!  Wait for you!  Alright, let's do it.  Oh, see? So far so good.  It'll change.  I know it is.  This is fucking horse shit. 
[02:12:30]  They can only go five seconds before they went into their format, Jimmy.  Hey, that's good.  The singer is the weak link in this band.  Observer Report made $24 million.  That's it?  At the box office?  Disgusting.  That movie was way better than what I...  The...  The mall cop. 
[02:13:00]  You know, I think Jimmy's wrong, though.  Maybe one more, Travis.  Yeah, yeah.  One more.  Give the title.  Do you want the title, or do you want Jim to hear the song?  No, I want the title.  Alright.  This is, uh, Your Kid Committed Suicide Because You Suck.  How do you think this one goes, Jimmy?  Uh, a lot like the other ones, but it's a little bit longer, like...  Right. 
[02:13:30]  We know.  Gotcha.  You're pissing off a lot of your anal cunt fans, Jimmy.  They're out there.  Yeah.  When would you play that? 
[02:14:00]  By the way, when would you ever play that?  When your party's over and you want everyone to leave.  Clear the room fucking faster than Agent Orange.  But you know, one dopey kid would jump up and go, it's about time, and just take over  the room all happy.  It's about time, playing some good shit.  Is it true?  Eric and Philly, I can't get to the phones right now, because I would have to reach, and  I really don't feel like reaching right now. 
[02:14:30]  Eric writes, anal cunt put out a love album.  Is that true, Travis?  Really?  Uh, it is.  I don't know if that's true.  What wacky title is it?  I love you to die, or I love your death.  Something...  I guarantee you, it's something...  Ho, ho.  It's called Picnic of Love.  Okay, fine.  Picnic of Love.  I love it.  Some of the song titles are, uh...  I respect your feelings as a woman and a human.  That's pretty funny.  Saving ourselves for marriage.  Greed is something that we don't need. 
[02:15:00]  What?  I'm not that kind of boy.  That's very funny.  Like, what does it matter, though, if you can't understand the words, what the title is?  Exactly.  It's more funny.  The whole thing is about having funny song titles, playing fast, and bellowing like an  idiot.  Well, good news, they do a cover of Staying Alive.  You got that one, Travis?  Oh, wow.  A little disco.  How do you think Staying Alive would go about it?  It'll start off recognizable, because they know that once they go into what they do, it's  like fucking train tracks.  It just sounds like a train coming. 
[02:15:30]  It's a train rumbling down the track.  I mean, redundancy-wise, it's the exact same noise over and over.  But they'll at least help you out and go, this is the song we're playing.  So you know, okay.  How long will it be recognizable?  Five seconds.  Five seconds.  All right.  You got that, Travis?  No, sadly, I don't.  Motherfucker.  We had a nice setup to that.  We might have it on YouTube.  Did you guys hear how good that setup was?  Perfect.  God damn it.  We're brilliant.  None better.  None better.  I probably could have played just any song and told you that that's what it was.  You're right.  Yeah, that's true. 
[02:16:00]  This is leading to shit dick.  Look at that, by the way, I'm out.  This is leading to shit dick.  People are repulsing shit dick on the phones, on the instant feedback.  They lie.  Do you want some of the stuff from the love album?  Yeah.  Picnic of love?  Picnic of love.  Do you want, I'm not that kind of boy, or I respect your feelings as a woman?  I'm not that kind of boy.  Or here's, obviously this isn't on the same album, but right underneath those two is Ha Ha  Holocaust. 
[02:16:30]  Come on.  They did not write a song named Ha Ha Holocaust.  They're obviously in on the goof.  Holy shit.  They're goofing, right?  Is that what Ant-A-L-C-T is all about?  They have to be.  They have to be.  Come on, now.  You can't write a song like that.  Here's, I'm not that kind of boy.  I hope it's good.  I can't prove it.  All right.  Oh, you want me to do this one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was selling flowers by the side of the road, and you killed my flowers instead. 
[02:17:00]  I was telling you about berries and roses, but you tried to grab my hand.  Ha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Ha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Ha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Ha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm blood and fuck it's my choice.  Sorry, I'm not that kind of boy.  You're missing a heart as a toy.  Sorry, I'm not that kind of boy.  It's a joke.  I like the guitar.  This is better than what they normally do.  I like the guitar, actually.  Yeah.  You think love's a game, whatever you wish.  But for me, it's years till that magical first kiss. 
[02:18:00]  I'll wait until my heart's on cloud nine.  Is the A supposed to look like an asshole, and the C like a cunt?  All right.  Oh, they're all in with their name.  Oh, my God.  Could someone get that part in my replay?  It's going to drive people nuts.  That is bad.  Let's go to Matt in Maryland.  Matt, just laying in front of the door again, Matt. 
[02:18:30]  Anal Cunt fans checking in.  Anal Cunt is completely serious.  All right, Matt, what do you got?  Yeah, sure they are.  Hey, you know what?  Drinking at Cups, the dude for no reason says 5-6-4-3, get real.  Hear that part?  Yes.  Here's the Analcon EP titled 5-6-4-3 Song EP.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Crazy.  I bet I fist, I bet I fiddlest, burned, patter, scoom, patted, little kid in the background 
[02:19:00]  fucking going crazy.  Crazy.  Hey.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I love that part.  Hold on.  We're doing the la-la part.  Let me turn this down a little bit.  What do you got there, Tom?  I'm a fireman in a suburb of Chicago.  I've actually been to two suicides where Dave Manthews band is playing on a loop.  So I think that Dave Manthews kills people. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, okay.  More than Ozzy, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking.  No, I certainly want it to fucking blow my brains out of this.  I'll tell you one thing.  Anal cunt has, to me, more varied music openings than fucking dumb Dave Matthews.  I wish I could have said that better.  I bet you every fucking mid-level manager in this place loves Dave Matthews.  They probably all loosen their fucking shirts, take their ties off, kick back on a Friday  with a brew.  We're rocking.  You know they would take a field trip together to a Dave Matthews.  Of course they would.  Dressing casually, but they're not casual. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Ugh.  Would you ever hang out with those people?  Linda Carter is singing.  Is that what she's doing?  Why she's going around?  She still looks fucking pretty good, though, man.  For her age?  Holy shit.  Yeah, let's see if the tits held up, though, Jimmy.  She'll be here today.  Really?  Yeah, she's here yesterday.  She'll be here today.  Is she coming in?  Yeah, she's doing an interview.  Doing our show?  No, she's doing Judith Riggs.  Oh, oh.  She's fucking sexy, man, for an older woman.  That's to be an older woman that you'd want to bang.  Let me say hi to some dude in Corpus Christi. 
[02:20:30]  He wants us to play.  Where the fuck are you, Corpus Christi?  You want that old lady hand around your cock?  I do.  It's Wonder Woman's.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Look at it.  No.  Look at it.  I want those wrinkled fingers in my ass in the invisible plane.  You realize you're not on a plane, just laying on the runway, having an old lady finger  at your rear end, and the police come for you?  You're yelling, take off.  It's like, yeah, why would you want an invisible plane if they could see you?  Hey, look, there she is, flying through the sky in nothing.  Stupid.  It certainly is. 
[02:21:00]  Sammy Hagar's got a new band.  Oh, I'm sure it's terrific.  We passed on them, and they're doing press everywhere.  Chicken Foot.  I guess they're doing all right, the Chicken Foot.  Yeah, apparently.  What the hell's that about?  That's who they got there.  Chili Peppers drummer.  Right?  Chad Smith is in that one.  Oh, really?  And Michael Anthony.  And Sammy.  And Sammy.  And what's his name?  The guitar player there.  Eddie Van Halen?  No, I don't know. 
[02:21:30]  Is it Wolfgang?  Satriani, I think.  Oh, yuck.  Satriani.  What's the name of the new band?  Chicken Foot.  Ugh.  Why is it Chicken Foot?  Because it's called Chicken Foot.  Can we hear a little bit of it?  Do we have any Chicken Foot in there?  I'm sure it's a bomb in there.  I don't know if they're hit.  It's like their new release.  No, I'm sorry.  We don't.  What?  How do we not have Chicken Foot?  I apologize.  I don't know.  There's got to be Chicken Foot, because aren't they playing on one of the stations here? 
[02:22:00]  I'm about to take a phone call that could offend a lot of people.  Warning, warning, warning.  Let's say hi to George in D.C.  George?  Morning, folks.  Hi.  I saw Anal Con about a month ago, and they debuted a new song.  It's called Beating Up Niggers for Selling You Fake Crack.  Hmm.  How did it go?  It's like...  Big crack, big crack. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, more or less.  More or less.  But it was the weirdest show, because it was a strange mix of, like, there were a lot of,  like, punk rock kids, but then there were also frat boys.  And I didn't really understand it, but they made more of the songs than any of the punk  kids did, so...  Yeah.  Well, is it true that Phil sings on a lot of those songs, or what's his relationship with  the band?  I know their lead singer is Seth Putnam.  The dude is kind of famous for overdosing and being in a coma for about two months, 
[02:23:00]  and then, like, not being able to walk, but playing shows while sitting down, and still  being his completely insane self.  But, I don't know, they're a kind of cool dude, so...  All right.  I think I'm going to do some Googling of this anal cunt.  A little Google.  A little Google.  Do you have...  Did you find Chicken Foot?  Oh, yeah.  We got Chicken Foot.  I want to hear a little Sammy.  Let's see if it sounds like typical Sammy.  Yeah, he's fucking horrendous.  This is down the drain.  I like Sammy Hagar.  Oh, do you?  Oh, I think he's terrible.  I was a fan of Sammy Hagar. 
[02:23:30]  Well, you weren't.  I was a fan of the Sammy.  Yeah, what's wrong with Sammy?  He's awful.  Sammy.  Oh, God.  Holy shit, this is fucking bad.  It's going to be so annoying.  I love when you get annoyed.  It's like the B-side of every fucking album.  Listen, man, come on.  They're building up the stuff.  Let's go.  It better be.  Why is he talking? 
[02:24:00]  Well, that's normal.  Exactly.  It's just like...  It's fucking awful.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  For the intro.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Sometimes you gotta roll with an up-up.  Some things are better left in the closet.  Some things just...  You're like David Caron-y. 
[02:24:30]  Someone tells me this isn't the hit.  Really?  Better not be, is what you're saying?  Yeah.  You'll know after this verse, the chorus will come in.  This is his textbook songwriting.  Oh, this is brutal.  It is droning. 
[02:25:00]  Here it comes.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not in.  It's just the dawn checking and sounds a little like running with the devil.  Yeah.  In the background here.  Yeah.  Good call.  Yeah.  It's just the retooled Van Halen song.  Yeah.  You're right. 
[02:25:30]  Why is Chad in the band?  What's going on with the Red Hot Chili Peppers?  That he has time to hang out with Chickenfoot.  I don't know.  But he does.  Fade out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not for chicken shit.  Chickenfoot.  He likes Sammy, though.  He's been good to us over the years.  Chicken, chicken scoot.  Ah, yeah.  Yes.  I like what that chicken was singing better.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[02:26:00]  Chicken anal cunt.  What?  First song's a single.  Oh, you want to hear the single?  Oh, is that the single?  Oh, is that the single?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Let's hear it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's called Oh, yeah.  It's called Oh, yeah.  Sammy's 61, by the way.  Wow.  No shit.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, no.  It's a fucking.  Who liked having a great time before the song started?  I hate that.  That was a David Lee Roth staple.  If I were a healer, I'd use my hands 
[02:26:30]  I'd put a spell on you  If I were a magic man  If I were a healer, Buddha or a cave  If I were a bruise man  Oh, Lord, I could sing about how I want to be 
[02:27:00]  You're a hoochie-coochie man  You got me out of your head  Oh, yeah  Come on, baby, tell me what you want  Oh, yeah  Come on, baby, tell me what you need  Oh, yeah  Nothing I wouldn't do for you  Can I say that?  I'll say this. 
[02:27:30]  His voice does sound really good.  His voice is amazing.  It's a really good voice.  I can't say it's not.  Lyrically, it's fucking atrocious.  You didn't like hoochie-coochie, man?  Yeah, that was blues, man.  All right, the idea of the blues, man.  Who are you fucking?  Ronnie Van Zandt sang about that in 75.  Stop.  You're not a blues, man.  Hoochie-coochie, man.  What is a hoochie-coochie man?  I don't know.  Fucking asshole.  You might need a Wikipedia in that. 
[02:28:00]  I got the nice chant.  I do actually like the song.  It's catchy.  Yeah, I don't want to like it.  Sammy knows how to make a catchy song.  Yeah.  I don't know if I would buy it or download it, but whatever.  I download this one just out of the iPod.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Literally, it's fucking sick.  Sammy's voice is great.  Yeah.  Got a range of a motherfucker, that guy.  Yeah, I get it.  No more songs about the hoochie-coochie man.  That's what we're getting at.  That's the hoochie-coochie man. 
[02:28:30]  Who fucking?  Why didn't somebody go, look, can we change that to anything but that?  Your hubba-bubba man.  Your toenail jam man.  You know?  Jimmy hates the hoochie-coochie man.  Everyone hates the hoochie-coochie.  Look, can you look that up, please?  It's legend.  Mini the moochie man.  It's a blues legend.  Mini the moochie.  What does Z-Rock got?  He's in front of a man.  An awful fucking serious satellite radio shirt.  Sorry.  And a dicky fucking-  Brown nose!  Oh, really? 
[02:29:00]  What the fuck, dude?  Why are you brown nosing?  Fucking worm.  You fucking trustee.  What, are you painting Mel's office today?  You want him to know you're part of the team?  What are you doing?  I didn't know you were a brown noser.  What the fuck, dude?  God damn, dude.  We came from XM.  God damn, man.  We used to make fun of that fucking shit.  Giant pimple on your neck.  I wasn't fortunate enough to get the serious hoodie that somebody else on our staff gets,  so I got the team.  Who got that?  Who got that?  Oh, by the way, by the way, want everyone to notice, the passing of the buck just happened.  Oh, baby! 
[02:29:30]  He's still doing it.  He was in a jam up, and he's like, let me usher this off to somebody else.  And you gotta appreciate that.  Yeah, I love the pass the buck.  Who got the serious hoodie?  Who's got the hoodie?  Um, primetime Sam Roberts.  Oh, primetime Sam Roberts.  Is he a brown noser, too?  It's the worst.  Sam is a brown noser?  That motherfucker.  You know, all the crap we went through.  Is he wearing it?  With that fucking dog.  Dude, take that shirt off now.  Remember that shit we went through with the dog?  Yeah.  And you fucking now wear it with pride.  Yeah, do you? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, you suck.  Are you wearing it?  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you guys?  It's like a soccer jacket.  Yeah, it's like a jogging suit.  I don't even realize.  I like being over here, but that's brown nosing shit.  It's raining out, that's all.  Turn around.  Is there anything on the back?  Should be a target.  Oh, the dog.  Yeah, there you go.  The dog is on the back.  That looks good on the radio.  It says Sirius Salad Radio, the best radio on radio.  Sirius XM.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Where's the XM part?  It's a buzzing.  It's a bug.  It's a bug. 
[02:30:30]  This was...  Turned into a bug.  This is one of the older ones before there was an XM.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  I'm sure if you want the newer ones, they drop the XM.  Yeah, exactly.  That won't go obsolete.  Is there anything worse than brown nosers?  No.  You know a brown noser out there, don't you?  Dig deep.  Sure do.  Dig deep with your nose.  Nuzzle it right in there.  How about we take brown nosing phone calls next?  We all know one.  Yeah, that's right.  Fucking brown noser.  Lose the shirts, guys.  Please.  Check out... 
[02:31:00]  Please.  Gene the truck.  What is he saying?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Gene, what's up, man?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Yeah, you got to check out Chickenfoot's new single.  It's called We're Back and We're Better Than Ever.  That's exactly it.  The laughing is back.  Because I'm a hoochie-coochie man.  Bye-bye.  Later.  Yeah, this is Jimmy.  This could be a Chickenfoot song. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  For real.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long, long time.  Let me throw one of those spots out there.  We've been changes.  We've played some games.  Yeah.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  The more things stay the same.  I say.  We're a little bit older, but we might find us.  We're back.  We're better than ever.  We're back.  We're back.  I hate this song. 
[02:32:00]  We're back.  We're back.  We're better than ever.  We're back.  We're back.  Together forever.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  I like this part.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  Yeah.  We're back.  We're back.  But they'd be leaning back to back.  Eddie would be playing and smiling, and David would be leaning back to back. 
[02:32:30]  Of course.  Wolfgang would be there, smiling at them.  Yeah.  We're back.  We're, we're, we're.  I'm power harder.  I make you real.  I'm rolling touch you on my spirit wheel.  Oh, yeah.  It's catchy.  It is.  And Sammy Hagar's fucking voice is still right there. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Right the fuck there for Sammy Hagar.  I think I got to download this.  He has a lot of shit in his voice, man.  Yeah, he can sing.  And you know what?  He, he, he talked to us.  He said he just wants to have a good time with his music.  He doesn't want to take it too serious.  He wants to just, you know, write cool, fun songs.  Just party songs.  That's what he's about.  Hoochie Coochie Man.  Could we play the original Hoochie Coochie Man?  That's where it should have started and ended.  I think it's an old Willie Dixon song, but I think Muddy Waters made the Hoochie Coochie Man.  Oh, he's like, should I be a blues man? 
[02:33:30]  You got a little Hoochie Coochie by Muddy?  I have so many versions of Hoochie Coochie Man.  Oh.  Just whichever one you like.  Play the wrong one.  All right.  Play the absolute wrong one.  I'm sure this isn't what you're looking for.  Of course.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Hang on.  It's Ellen's audience clapping.  You're terrible, Travis.  Can you imagine taking this nail clipper and just fucking pinching the head of your cock  with it?  Oh, Jesus.  Ow.  Just pinching, like putting the corner in the hole and pinching.  Ow. 
[02:34:00]  No.  I can't.  How about just clip the edge of your tip off?  Oh.  Oh, wait, wait.  I got to get involved now.  You put it right over the hole and snip, so it comes out like a little piece of kalema.  A little ring.  Oh, like my mother used to make out of fucking penis tips.  Rest in peace.  She'd go down in a morgue.  She was a saint.  Just a saint in the way she would make the kalema. 
[02:34:30]  Right.  Dan H. from Rally writes, play It's About Time from VH.  It was their 2004 comeback with Sammy, and it's almost exactly like Jimmy's song.  What's it called?  We're back and better than ever?  It's called...  Oh, boy.  We're back.  We're back.  I think I'm getting more popular because the answer feedback just flies by now.  We're back.  We're back.  It's About Time?  I have that.  It's About Time.  Right.  Right.  Don't forget about Muddy Waters, though.  You're going to give me a little muddy.  I have like three versions of Muddy Waters. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  Try another Muddy.  All right.  Where's the Van Halen song?  Yeah, this is it.  Sounds like Bo Diddley.  Yeah.  These are all the same, by the way.  This sounds just like Bo Diddley.  It sucks a dick.  You wouldn't listen to this?  No!  Come on.  I don't mind this.  Bad to the bone.  Yeah, but this was before Bad to the Bone. 
[02:35:30]  Bad.  Well, these are the real guys.  Yeah, this was the...  Every one of them sounded like this.  What?  Every blues song was that.  But they were the first...  All right.  They were the first to put it on tape, my friend.  I hate this shit.  Everyone else afterwards.  Redundant.  Come on.  Let's roll Muddy.  It's the same old shit.  He's good, though. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  Enough.  A little taste.  What's the Van Halen one?  What's it called?  It's About Tired.  I went back.  They're saying it's close to what you did.  We have it?  I like the beat. 
[02:36:30]  Last time, wrong time, outside, out of line.  Yeah, but this time's our time.  Right on, we'll let it shine.  Get up.  Turn it off.  Clock back.  Paint red or black.  Bring it on.  Rock back.  Oh, hell yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Come on.  All right.  Hey, hey, hey.  You can spin my money.  Don't you waste my time?  My time.  My time.  Yeah, we're right now making up for lost time.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  I think it's high time.  We let it out there on the line.  Wow.  Yeah, it's about time. 
[02:37:30]  It's about time.  It's about time.  It's kind of telling that we're backstory, but...  I've never heard a song go off the cliff faster.  Like, it started off really heavy.  Yeah, yeah.  And then Eddie did that stupid bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, which I fucking hate when he does.  And then Hagar, again, his voice is good, but it's just nonsense.  All right.  Sammy is the shit. 
[02:38:00]  Yes.  Sammy is the shit.  That started really good.  Then it started to suck a big fucking pile of dicks.  I might have to download...  No, you're not.  You're going to forget.  Oh, yeah.  That one.  We got three...  Oh, yeah.  We got three chicken foot songs.  Oh, yeah.  Get it up and learning to fall.  Get it up.  Well, now that I...  Get it up is probably pretty sexually risque.  Pretty racy.  And now that it's 61, learning to fall.  So it's perfect.  At least he's got a sense of humor.  God love him.  This is very last before the song. 
[02:38:30]  What's funny?  Are you laughing in studio?  What's funny?  What do you get the fucking Marx Brothers on in the background?  Wah-ha!  Woo-rah!  The Marx Brothers.  Okay, asshole.  You don't like when they do that?  I fucking nothing...  I hate nothing more.  They just kind of get into the feel of what they're about to do.  Yeah, a bunch of boys about to have fun.  Get the fucking beers out!  Assholes.  What's wrong with getting the beers out?  Have nothing, but just don't laugh.  Like, yeah, whoo!  You don't need to tell me we're having fun.  If I'm having fun, I'll let you know.  Oh, my God.  But then you're telling.  Well, I'm saying I'm the one... 
[02:39:00]  If I'm having fun with the music, I'll let them know.  You don't have to show me that it's a ball before the lyrics even start.  All right.  Are we doing shit dick to break there, Travis?  Yeah, we got shit dick.  Yeah, I know you were on the same page.  Why don't we do this and we do something else after that?  Na-na-na-na-na.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah, we got it. 
[02:39:30]  Another overrated song.  Sorry, Van Halen fans.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  I live my life like this.  Not tomorrow!  You don't like this, eh?  I did back in 79.  All right.  Well, you taste change.  Oh, no.  What was...  Running with the devil.  Come on.  Now we're getting picky.  I kicked that.  The devil doesn't run.  That big cloven hooves.  His tail drags.  He walks slowly.  Did you like Eddie Van Halen growing up?  I said Eddie, not Eddie. 
[02:40:00]  Eddie Van Halen.  This is okay.  Growing up.  Hot for teachers, okay.  You know, they were okay.  I didn't think...  I don't think they stink.  I'm just...  I'm not a fan.  How about Jamie's crying?  Who cares about her?  For real.  How's that go?  Jamie's crying!  Meow, meow, meow.  No.  Why is she crying?  I don't get it.  She was...  Very badly raped.  See?  This is okay.  No Van Halen growing up?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  I think they're extraordinarily overrated.  Wow. 
[02:40:30]  I like their version.  It really got me.  That's great.  With a little eruption before that.  Yeah, eruption I was already told.  Not for the time, my friend.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  Eddie was doing some things with that guitar.  They did some things with his tongue.  Oh, shit.  He's using it as a paperweight.  Torch, stop.  Oh, oh, oh.  Is she?  All right.  Why don't we move on? 
[02:41:00]  We did a lot of music today.  Certainly did.  You know why we did a lot of music?  Because...  We're queers.  Les Paul is 94 years old today.  See?  That's how we tie it in.  Oh, yeah?  94 years young.  I'm 57 years young.  I'll be 58 in March.  No, you have to be 58 by now.  I'm 57 years young, Greg.  You have to be 58 going on 59.  I used to babysit you.  We all know that.  I used to babysit you.  I remember one time I gave you a talking to.  I told you about the birds and the bees, and you ran up the apple tree. 
[02:41:30]  That was my dad.  No, no, no.  He went and got you.  And I ran up there before it came.  The birds and the bees.  Yeah, he showed you.  I'm like, this is what you do to make yourself feel good.  And you're like, Uncle Paul, why is it standing up straight?  And Uncle Paul said?  Oh, that's good.  Uncle Paul in the sky.  I love my uncle.  Was that an I love my Uncle Paul bib? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, right.  Holy shit.  Where'd you find that?  Is someone selling that from, like, our community?  Looks like it goes around a cock.  No, I don't think so.  That's cute.  I think it's just, you know, you could put whatever you want on a t-shirt and have it  hosted on a site somewhere.  I think Travis did that with his shitty dog.  So, this is available for purchase somewhere.  Are there Dexter shirts that no one bought but you?  You know, someone bought a Dexter shirt?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  That's great. 
[02:42:30]  How about that?  I hope they were killed on drunk Friday Dexters.  Hit by a drunken fucking, they have a drunk, like, Mac ball from a truck on the front of  the Dexter shirt.  We may have created a baby onesie with Dexter's picture on it and then we may have put it  up on Cafe Press.  Huh?  No.  How do I turn you off?  I can control it.  Give me a button to turn you off in there.  Can't do that.  God damn it.  Can't do that.  He actually has true control, Travis.  Yeah, I know.  Yes, he does.  Hey, speaking of Jamie's Crying, I heard we almost lost Tone Loke. 
[02:43:00]  What happened there?  What's the connection to Jamie's Crying and Tone Loke?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Ah, okay.  No, Jimmy.  No.  He didn't do anything.  A wild thing?  Because Jamie was a wild thing?  I think he sampled a little Jamie's Crying, right?  Right.  A wild thing?  Yeah.  I think he passed out or something at a concert.  He's still performing.  A wild thing.  Maybe we can find that story.  What happened?  Or maybe not.  Maybe no one gives a shit.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[02:43:30]  He was big for ten minutes.  I know.  But yet these are a couple of enjoyable beats.  Did you like this growing up in?  Nah.  You didn't like this?  Nah, none of this shit.  Why not?  The only stuff I liked during this time was NWA and Ghetto Boys.  How about Eric B and Rakim?  You didn't like them?  Are you a criminal?  I only liked the fucking hardcore gangster shit because it was hysterically funny.  You didn't like the pop rap?  No.  How about Big Daddy Kane?  Fuck that.  But the fat boys.  Parents just don't understand. 
[02:44:00]  That's Bill Smith.  That was a little silly.  Little.  You're not going to get anything.  How about Houdini?  The freaks come out at night.  No.  How about Just Ice?  No.  How about Bust the Move, Young MC?  Ghetto Boys.  Ghetto Boys.  That was the shit.  What about Bust the Move?  Nope.  I didn't care about Bust the No Move.  How about Run DMC?  Nope.  Run DMC for real?  No.  Wow.  How about Dana Dane?  I only liked NWA and Ghetto Boys because it was funny shit. 
[02:44:30]  They would sing just everything about whores, hoes and drugs and fucking killing people.  How about Slick Rick and Dougie Fresh?  And no.  Dougie Fresh.  He's beatbox.  Fab Five Freddy.  Oh wow, yeah.  More music.  We can't stop us.  God, this old school shit is just hysterical.  Some of it doesn't hold up.  It's so old.  This is like hip hop's answer to doo-wop music. 
[02:45:00]  Like compared to rock music now, this is fucking doo-wop and doo-wop and doo-wop and bop  bop doop doop.  You're probably right.  Hey, speaking of Uncle Paul.  Sure.  We have a pedo story in the paper today.  You know, when you was young.  No, not me.  It would be really hot, Greg.  And you'd go, Uncle Paul, it's so hot out.  So I'd make you a cumsicle.  Oh, fuck.  I'd put some cum in the ice tray and put a cigarette button there. 
[02:45:30]  Why would that be pleasurable for anyone?  Like even the creepiest creep.  Why would a cumsicle?  Like, what the fuck, dude?  Usually Uncle Paul.  Name one person that would enjoy a cumsicle.  Note, Paul raised his hand.  Usually Uncle Paul isn't so blatant.  Well, you know, he was very poor.  All he had was sardines in the house and papaya juice.  He's a very awful diet.  Jackie's half-brother busted in kiddie porn raid. 
[02:46:00]  This is on pretty much the front page of the paper today.  Just about.  Just missed.  Jiminy.  Page two or three.  Jackie Kennedy's half-brother, who has long lived a quiet existence in a sleepy Oregon suburb,  was busted for harboring a sickening kiddie porn habit, authorities said yesterday.  As opposed to another kind of kiddie porn habit?  There's the sickening ones, and then there's what?  Well, there are the funny ones.  Endearing, funny, sensitive. 
[02:46:30]  Well, you don't fuck the kids.  You just lick their feet and run.  That's kind of funny.  Oh, my God.  It's creepy, but it's funny.  Oh, my God.  You lick their feet and run.  Yeah.  You lick their tootsies and run.  Hey, someone licked my tootsies.  Mommy, that man, his mustache tickled my tootsies.  Did he touch you?  His mustache tickled the bottom of my tootsies.  And then he made a stain in his pants and ran away.  My feet smell like bad breath.  Yeah.  My feet smell like cigarettes and liquor. 
[02:47:00]  That's terrible.  My feet smell like sardine oil and papaya juice.  So what did this character do?  Well, they share the same mom, this creep in Jackie O.  Jackie O.  And this happened in October, but the paper finally got the documents.  And here's the one thing you never want to happen to your house.  Uh-oh.  Computers and other electronic equipment were seized during the search. 
[02:47:30]  When you see them pulling those things out of houses during the search.  When you see a keyboard poking out of a box.  A box.  The guy's got rubber gloves on and he's a big box with a tower in it.  Not good.  Whatever you have or ever have had, they're going to find.  They'll find it.  I don't care how many times you've wiped that fucking hard drive clean.  And this guy trying to get out of it, in an interview with his local paper, he said  the information about the photos is a private matter.  Yes, between me and the children. 
[02:48:00]  I paint my hard drive with thermite paint.  So if they show up, I blow it up.  Because I was a Navy SEAL.  Shut up.  Do you know the panic you must feel when you hear, uh, it's the police, and you know that  you have 11 gigs of child porn?  11 gigs.  Do you know how fucking, you'd probably think, is there one button that deletes everything  forever?  Uh, could you wait at the door?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Be right there.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  I'll bet you panic and unplug your computer.  They'll never get it now.  Yeah.  This computer's broken.  We might as well leave it here and give up.  We'll never catch him.  Would you try to eat your hard drive?  Dude.  What would you do?  I wonder how many people were caught just taking that computer and smashing it all the  floor.  Over and over again as they're trying to get through the front door.  The monitor, while the hard drive is fine.  The monitor, yes.  I'll show him.  The mouse, he's swinging around, throwing it against the wall.  Van Halen, guitar hero, coming out at the end of the year. 
[02:49:00]  That's good.  Oh, uh, we got a story from Jason in Virginia.  Jason, go ahead.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, which you fully enjoy.  Go ahead.  Good evening.  Hello.  Good evening.  That's getting old, huh?  No.  Hey, they busted a guy one street over from me and he was in his seventies or late seventies.  I don't know if, uh, if Danny or anybody could find the picture of him on the internet, but  he's a complete creep.  He, he, his arrest photo, he has like a nasal cannula. 
[02:49:30]  He's on oxygen, but, uh, they busted him for child porn.  So now I have like a face to go with the, uh, uncle Paul character and I'm, and I've  got a three-year-old and I'm completely creeped out.  Jimmy, you're a sick fuck.  Punching out, buddy.  All right.  Hey, um, a lot of people pissed off at the Van Halen thing.  Ian Rice from Long Island writes, for fuck's sake, what music does Anthony like?  I've never heard him not shit on the genre or artists. 
[02:50:00]  I said, I liked Van Halen back in the day, as they say, the day, of course, Alice in  Chains, Alice in Chains, of course, solid, uh, Nirvana, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Chris  Cornell, Soundgarden, I have my era, I have my three year span, no kidding, what about old  school, old school, I'm sure it'll, it'll be rock.  I was kind of into the, uh, you like Stone Temple Pilots too.  Yeah, yeah, STP, definitely. 
[02:50:30]  I was kind of into the, um, you know, I got sucked up in that Southern Rock thing back  in the day.  You like Skinnerd?  Um, Skinnerd.  I love Skinnerd.  Molly Hatchett, Charlie Daniels, Marshall Tucker.  Not so much.  Fucking, all that happy horse shit.  Yeah, you went deep with the Southern Rock.  Yeah.  Molly Hatchett.  What's a Molly Hatchett song?  I don't even know Molly Hatchett.  Rock and bop up here.  Do you have a Molly Hatchett?  I don't know.  Blood weight disaster.  There's whistling in the song.  I liked a couple of their songs. 
[02:51:00]  I don't know.  Do we have a favorite?  I don't know.  Anyone.  No, it's flirting with disaster.  Flirting with disaster.  That's probably their biggest, no?  I do not know one Molly Hatchett who heard of this.  You know this.  You know this.  You know this.  You're probably sitting around a campfire with your friends listening to this.  They must live nice in the South.  Really?  Drinking your beers.  You've got to think they live nice in the South.  It has that nice.  Fighting your homosexuality? 
[02:51:30]  Yes.  I mean, no.  The double leads.  How could you forget this voice?  You know this, right, Jimmy?  No?  This is weird.  It's like a Muppet.  Yeah.  This is pretty cool.  Yeah.  We've got that double lead thing going. 
[02:52:00]  Who else did you like, Ant?  Southern Rockwise.  Yeah.  You said Charlie Daniels.  Oh, man.  Not 38 Special, though, right?  No, that's just before 38 Special, really.  I like that.  Like some Marshall Tucker, I guess.  I don't know one Marshall Tucker song.  That's a little more mellow.  Yeah.  What's one Marshall Tucker song, Travis? 
[02:52:30]  I honestly don't know who these bands are.  I remember them growing up.  I don't know their music.  I didn't think of a Marshall Tucker song.  All right.  We can listen to the whole fucking album.  Yeah, we can figure that out.  I think it's true.  Ian's instant feedback continues.  Then he writes, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Eddie Van Halen blows Tony Iommi away.  Yeah, he gets.  Of course he does.  Sure.  Molly.  As Jimmy sits there in an Ozzy Oswald.  T-shirt, he's going to agree with me.  It's just silly.  Eddie is a good guitarist, but it's like, all right, already.  We got it. 
[02:53:00]  Eruption.  Oh, yes.  You know what?  I only invented that fucking guitar.  What's weird?  I can't think of a Marshall Tucker song.  I can't either.  It's driving me nuts.  I know this one.  Like, I know this shit.  I had to play this forever.  Oh, there was the General Store Blues, and then there was Bring Me a Pipe.  Wait, don't even go.  Can't you see?  Yeah, can't you see?  There you go.  That's like their hair.  I knew there was a C in one of their songs.  There was a live version.  Good work.  King of the live version.  Exactly.  Fucking just that live version.  How about you choose the second one every time now?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:53:30]  And you're going to be right.  King of the live version.  Yeah.  Live versions from Studio?  Fuck you.  Uh-oh.  Oh, they did have a flute.  You know what?  You're going to take a beating now.  I forgot they did have a flute.  Rock with flutes.  This is when you were mellowing out, man.  This is when you were mellowing out.  Yeah, man.  Smoking a little weed.  Drinking a little Jack Dandas in the woods.  Light a fire.  Those are dopes.  You've got to think, like, Ian Anderson looked ridiculous going to concerts with his little 
[02:54:00]  flute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With his little flute.  Get flute luggage.  Flute luggage, right.  Get the little case.  The flute.  Worship.  People would joke at him.  The guy has a guitar slung over his shoulder, and Ian comes to the concert with his little  flute.  All his friends would put their scrotums on the mouth part of his flute.  There's seven people in this band?  Wow.  Yeah, they like to hang out.  Those Southern rockers love the big band.  I do like Southern rock, man.  A bunch of guys with big hats who fuck their own sisters. 
[02:54:30]  You coming now?  Now.  I'm going to take a red train.  Down at the station hall.  I don't care where it goes.  Nice.  Never cares where it goes.  Yeah, they never do.  I always want to know where I'm going.  Yes.  Fuck no.  I have to know where my fucking train's going.  You're on the road.  You don't give a shit.  You're just out there on the road, Jimmy.  Come on.  But it's a train.  It doesn't deviate.  You know where it's going.  You can look on the next.  Yeah, that's a good point.  I've heard this. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Everyone knows where the train is going.  Oh.  All right.  We got school also.  I fucking loved Deep Purple.  Oh, yeah.  Loved fucking Deep Purple.  I like the later stuff.  Yeah, that stuff was good.  Meaning like knocking on your back door.  Yeah, knocking on your back door.  And the other one.  What's the other huge one from that?  Perfect Strangers.  Yes.  Those two.  With that guitar in the beginning.  I know. 
[02:55:30]  Give me a little Perfect Strangers.  Little Perfect Strangers.  Deep Purple.  Come on.  It's fucking music day on the Opie and Anthony show.  You really are talking a lot about music.  Oh, the live version.  Are you kidding?  No.  You fucking piece of...  We told you to pick the second one every time.  Yeah, you really are.  You know what you are?  You're a fucking...  You're a live version.  That's the only reason he has a beard.  So you know it's a person.  Not a shit bucket.  Damn.  Who was the keyboard player?  Wasn't it...  What's his name?  John Lourdes.  Rick Allen.  Who?  I think John Lourdes or something. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, shit.  I don't know that.  John Lourdes.  I was in a gang called The Lourdes.  Of course you were.  This is some good shit, man.  This is fucking rock.  This is fucking rock.  We might be dating ourselves, but come on.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Can you remember?  Good shit.  Remember my name?  As I flowed in your life.  A thousand oceans I have flown. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, as I come.  Good shit.  It was actually the other one that has the cool guitar.  Yeah.  Knocking on your back door.  Fills.  All my life.  Look at those guys.  I have made a cool year. 
[02:57:00]  We can fade out.  There's a picture of Deep Purple.  That was good shit.  And there's a guy in the end with a fucking, like a light green satin jacket.  It's a truck.  Who keeps their hands in their jacket pocket for a band photo?  But he's not the problem.  I think the guy in the middle is the problem.  With the fucking horrible beard.  Mustache.  The big Lebowski.  He's a creative.  They're all trying to look cool.  None of them look cool.  That picture doesn't really hold up, huh?  No, it's awful.  The coolest guy is the fucking, is the guy with the red all the way to the left.  Exactly.  He's not in the photo. 
[02:57:30]  We're here.  A little knocking on your back door.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on, Charles.  Let's go.  Here we go.  Listen to this fucking guitar.  Yeah.  Very ominous.  That sounds like it was done with a bow.  Doesn't it?  Is that possible?  Yeah, it sure is.  I'm scared.  This fucker kicks in nice.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I will listen to this song every time it's on the radio.  I'll stop whatever I'm fucking doing. 
[02:58:00]  Of course.  I've never heard this.  No?  For real, Jimmy?  I don't think so.  How'd you avoid radio for two decades?  Great as that.  I'm glad I did.  How'd you avoid it, though?  I would listen to it.  I always hate the radio.  They would talk over the song.  That's what I'm doing.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha. 
[02:58:30]  Sweet Lucy was a dancer  But no one was a dancer  Because she was a samurai  She made an electric shadow  Beyond our fingertips  But none of us could reach that high  She came on like a teaser  I had to touch the beat  All right.  We could do this all day  But we've got to change gears  We've got some great  Great fucking pedo stories  The good pedo stories, by the way 
[02:59:00]  You know, where  That might be just of age  Fucking  Listen to this one  John in New York  John  Hi, John  Hey, John  Sean from Georgia, actually  Wow, sorry  Wow, they really got that one wrong  Fucking phone screener  It's Albany, Georgia  But recently down here  At Albany High School  The basketball team  The girls' basketball team  Had a party at one of the hotels  After the season was over  And one of the coaches  At the school  Not the basketball coach 
[02:59:30]  Just a PE coach  Decided to start texting the girl  And one of the girls  On the basketball team  Telling her that he  Wanted to have sex with her  And all this  And he decided  It was a good idea  To show up to the hotel  Where the party was  And all the coaches were  And he showed up  With some alcohol  And got fired  And I believe  That's charges  Pressed against him right now  Oh, that's not good  You can't show up  At the hotel room  Where the big party's going on  No  Teenage girls  From your high school  I know y'all were 
[03:00:00]  Talking about Dave Matthews earlier  His song Angel  Will get you laid  Every time  No, it won't  When they fall asleep  You just climb on  And stick it in  Before they wake up  Every girl  Every girl thinks  It's the greatest  Song ever made  No, they don't  Know what  Will get you laid  Every time  Happy birthday  If you have a gun  Any song  If you have the right weapon  If you have a lead pipe  Fucking crazy  Trying to get you laid  Roofies will get you laid

[03:01:30]  Yeah, they all say that  He didn't get in trouble  For just talking  I was only talking  There's something else  Going on there  You know, when you think  Of pedophiles  Or you look at  David Carradine  Or  Like  When you look at people  That have a high  Why David Carradine?  Not as a pedophile  I'm saying  What he needed to get off  Oh, okay  Like, you know  Apparently he needed  To have something  Tied around his neck  And like  I'm a fucking filth bag  Did you read up  On this David Carradine?  His ex-wife  Was he just talking about  How he came up  With these crazy contraptions  Oh, no  For his sexual needs

[03:08:00]  I 
[03:08:30]  I  ever seen Roger Clemens  standing right in George  Steinbrenner's box, announcing  he is back. There's a ramp going  by with people in it, because of her  spittle. And there we go, John. You don't have  to worry about who's going to take that spot.  That is wet. That is damp.  You should see what's going on in  the Yankee dugout. Big grin.  Yeah. Pettichita  peanuts. Pessana's  leafing through Highlights magazine and  jerking off. Roger Clemens is now a Yankee. 
[03:09:00]  Attention fans, he is here.  Derrick Keene is ignoring some nobody  comedian.  We, uh, that is...  I cannot fucking get enough of that,  because she just...  Let me paint the picture  for you.  There's nothing going on.  It's the worst thing. The water cooler's got water  in it, and the bench is still where it  was yesterday. The phone to the  bullpen is on the hook. Bunch of  gloves in the little glove storage areas. 
[03:09:30]  And the greens  keepers, the field keepers, whatever  they're called, are coming out to cover  the field from ice metal.  The best part is she has a heavy  Boston accent. Oh, yeah.  And she covers the Yankees.  And she covers the Yankees.  My bread is blocks. What a terrible  fucking, uh, war correspondent she'd be.  Can we search out brand new Susan  Wallman clips? I think it's about time.  Oh, do we have to?  She had a... She must get  excited from time to time.  They're raising the flag  here on Iwo Jima.  But no, she wouldn't get the key part.  During the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, 
[03:10:00]  oh my god,  it's supposed to be cloudy,  but it's actually nicer out.  Everybody's boots are muddy.  We won't have to worry about  what kind of weather  we're getting in the jungle today.  She is the worst.  Oh, her fucking giant wet leaf lips.  Oh, shit.  She cries.  She cries.  Oh, come on.  We might have a new  Susan Wallman.  During the Joe Torre.  I don't know how good this is.  It's about Joe Torre, I think.  No way.  Oh, we...  I think we played this.  No way.  Let's hear it.  I think when they were 
[03:10:30]  knocked out of the playoffs  or something like that.  Well, when Joe was...  Yankee post-game show.  Let's play and see where it goes.  The first question was  about his future.  He didn't want to talk about that.  He said,  I told the players  I was so proud of what they did.  They were in a hole.  Sometimes you get complacent.  Sometimes you forget  how hard it is.  We didn't forget.  Then he said something  that everybody in the room,  we all looked at each other.  He said,  this Yankee team  has a great future.  It's got a lot of young kids.  There is no question 
[03:11:00]  about the ability  of these people.  They're very impressive.  He said,  you think it's going  to last forever?  And...  This is rough.  He's your friend.  Oh, shut up.  He said...  My prostate hurts.  This has been  the best 12 years of my life.  All right.  I wouldn't have missed  this for anybody.  Now, I was okay, actually,  until I went into the clubhouse  and the coaches...  I saw somebody's car.  Yeah, exactly.  Gary Sheffield hit my mouth  with his cock  and the tears  that you hear in my voice 
[03:11:30]  are coming down  the faces of the coaches  in that coaches room.  Well, Susan...  And Rivera threw a fastball  at my anus.  In life, unfortunately,  all good things come to an end.  Really?  That's very poignant, John.  All good things come to an end.  Six World Series appearances,  four championships,  and 12 postseason appearances  in 12 years.  I guess she'll be broadcasting  forever.  And...  That's a quoting  of fortune cookies.  Well, you know, Susan...  Good things come to those  who wait. 
[03:12:00]  Confucius selling  my lucky numbers.  Yes.  She with big tongue  will have wet pants.  One more thing  that I'll say out here.  I don't know if he wants.  I think he does.  I don't know if he wants.  Talking about...  That was her.  When the inevitable...  Just yapping.  Yapping and yapping.  But Joe Torre,  that was the most  meaningless quotes ever.  He said they're all  a bunch of good kids  and they got bright futures.  And what did he say  about his 12 years?  Like, I would have missed  this for anything?  Of course not.  What else are you doing?  Ruining the Mets again?  It's a dream life. 
[03:12:30]  What is he supposed  to say in that position?  Exactly.  At least he said  I'm sick of lying  on my side.  And my stomach.  Because my tiny hole hurts.  Well, here's John Sterling.  His latest home run call  that we hate.  Yeah.  There's just tons  of these things.  A switch hitter  batting left pitch.  Swung on and there  it goes to deep right.  That ball is high.  And it is far.  It is gone. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, Nick Swisher  has driven  a two-run home run  to deep right center.  Why?  He's Swisher-licious.  His two-run blast  gives the Yankees  a 3-0 lead.  Do the biff.  Do the biff.  No way.  No way.  No way.  This is garbage.  Are you kidding me?  Swish.  He's Swisher-licious? 
[03:13:30]  Swisher-licious.  Is that his thing  for this guy?  That was my nickname.  It's like, as a Yankee fan,  how can you enjoy  listening to that broadcast?  Michael K. was pretty good.  How can you enjoy that?  It's deplorable  what he said there.  It's not funny.  It's not compelling.  No.  It's not cool.  It just stinks.  Horrible.  Dinks. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, that's a bad one.  God almighty.  Oh, I thought  Little Nicky was coming.  Where is Little Nicky?  We missed Little Nicky.  This guy who's the most  awkward walk I've ever seen.  Well, old swivel hips.  Can't forget him.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, my gosh.  Should we take a quick break  and then we'll wrap it up?  Oh, my God.  Uh, I guess Danny's  watching Lock Up, huh?  Like there's a big tent  in front of his pants?  No, actually,  I haven't been watching it. 
[03:14:30]  It's just this clip.  I was rooting around  for some material this morning  and I came across this clip  and I just thought  it was very funny.  Yeah, it's kind of  a slow thing in the news, really.  I think we've got to  spank North Korea.  I've really had enough  of that fucking little weirdo.  Yeah.  Now he's threatening  what kind of nuclear shit?  Aggressive nuclear action  or an offense?  Let him try.  He'll wind up  blowing himself up,  the dummy.  His missiles barely  fucking work.  I'm sure his nuclear bomb  doesn't even work.  South Korea, 
[03:15:00]  some big company  is pulling off the border  that they were on.  They've had enough of him, too.  The whole world  has had enough of this douchebag.  Why would you be on the border  with your business?  That's got to be just...  I know.  Nerve wracking.  I call it the 39th parallel.  38th parallel?  Yeah, 38th parallel.  What could you sell  that you need?  You think they have fun  on the border over there?  No.  There's no fun going on.  There's a lot of binoculars  and a lot of guns  pointing at you.  You think there's a lot  of binocular shops?  Lots of binocular shops.  Ye olde binocular shop. 
[03:15:30]  How do you get from...  Shoppy.  ...from north to south?  You've got to go through  Checkpoint Charlie.  Checkpoint Charlie.  Practice.  Practice.  Practice.  Yes.  Yeah.  Or if you run for it...  Oh, that's smart.  Those borders are usually  very wide.  That's the problem.  Yeah, that's what it is.  If it's one little line,  you'd have a lot more people  getting by.  They call it no man's land  in there.  Probably mines?  Yeah.  How long is it?  Barbed wire.  If you want to go from  North Korea to South Korea,  how long is it for real? 
[03:16:00]  The line?  It's got to be five,  six feet.  You think?  I would have thought longer.  Not longer.  I'm talking with, obviously.  When we were in Cuba,  me and Jeff Ross stood  on the U.S. side.  You weren't in Cuba ever, Jimmy.  You're not allowed to go there.  We weren't going to go there.  Oh, you weren't.  We were looking into the...  Oh, I got a shirt from you  from there.  Yes, you did.  I like wearing that shirt.  As we were looking  at the Cuban soldiers,  they might have been  a quarter of a mile,  half a mile.  Hi, boys.  Yes.  See, the checkpoints  themselves are...  Wait, it's one long field? 
[03:16:30]  They're not very big,  but then there's that  no man's land in between.  That's the field  that you have to run across  to get to the other side?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I've never been there.  What if you serpentine?  Yeah, you could try  to serpentine.  If you serpentine,  I think...  As they follow you  with fucking ridiculous machines.  Hey, it worked for Peter Falk.  I think you could serpentine  right over to the...  Serpentine!  Right over to South Korea.  What's that mean, serpentine?  To run like a snake.  Yeah, serpentine.  Oh, I thought it was  just to run straight  and make hissing sounds.  Jimmy, in-laws.  Your tongue out.  In-laws.  One of the best comedies ever. 
[03:17:00]  Of course you know.  One of the best comedies ever,  in-laws?  I haven't seen it in too long  to make a judgment right now.  I'll have to watch it again.  Oh, I saw that video.  John in Philly.  He hung up.  Danny, did you see the video  of the Indian guy  on top of the train?  Go to...  I heard about it.  Where the fuck did I see it?  It might have been on break.  It might have been on break.com.  Like, you know how they like  to pile people  on the train?  Oh, pile people on trains.  And then they start, like, 
[03:17:30]  going on top of the train?  Yeah.  If you could find...  Let me see.  Please tell me  they came to a low bridge  or a sign  or something.  Dude, wait till you see this.  Come on.  We'll turn you on  to the video  if you haven't seen it before.  We gotta find it, though.  If someone out there  knows exactly where we can find it,  that would be great.  Instant feedback.  That's shit.  Now, keep going.  I'll know it when I see it.  Ah, fuck me.  It's not break.  God damn it.  Was it Dig?  Uh, was it Google videos? 
[03:18:00]  Was it...  Uh...  Big Titted Monster?  Was it  SaveTheTitMonster.com?  Save the...  Look at SaveTheTitMonster.com.  If you're just tuning in,  we got SaveTheTitMonster.com  up and running.  We're hoping for national exposure,  but I think the name of the website  is really gonna fuck us over.  Yeah, that can fuck us up.  We're like anal cunts.  We fucked up with the name.  I don't know.  Anybody, anybody... 
[03:18:30]  Drunken Stepfather.  You know, Instant Feedback  hasn't reloaded in an hour.  We lost that.  Jesus Christ.  What's going on there?  Oh, Drunken Stepfather  or Daughter.  I always forget the name of that.  Father.  Father is a great website, yeah.  It's a good one.  And we lost Instant Feedback, too.  Another problem tonight.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  There are minefields  between North and South.  No, yeah, of course.  Anybody know where that video is?  Fuck.  What other video we got?  Motherfucker.  What's it?  Indian guys on train? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Why, you saw that?  No.  No.  I think maybe you could...  It's on top of the train.  Google.  Go Google.  We lost Instant Feedback.  Don't come over here, though.  It's all right.  It's too...  It's a small space.  It's a small space.  F.  What's that chick doing  with her tits just hanging out  in that picture?  Jesus.  If you were young...  Falling out a window?  Dude, if you were young  and you had nice tits,  wouldn't you just be, like,  all about showing them off?  Apparently not. 
[03:19:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Girls think differently.  They certainly do.  Yeah, we'd never find that.  All right, let me see.  I got to hang up on everybody  because we're trying  to find this video.  Oh, Opie.  I'm sorry to everyone  I just hung up on.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Should we take a break  and by the time we get back,  we'll have it?  Yeah, let's hang out a whiz.  Oh, you think you got it?  I think I might have it.  Hang on.  Yeah?  Let me see, Dan.  What do you got over there? 
[03:20:00]  All right, explain what's going on.  Pause this first.  I got it.  Okay.  All right, they're loading a train.  All aboard.  It looks like it's India.  I don't know.  And people are getting into the train  and now people are trying  to get a free ride  like we saw in...  I forgot the name of the fucking...  Slumdog Millionaire.  Slumdog Millionaire  where they like to ride on top.  Yeah.  So there's a guy on top  being all cocky  trying to get some other people  on top of the train  and now push play there, Dan.  You do see the wires 
[03:20:30]  right above the stairs.  Oh, shit.  You do see the wires.  No fucking way.  You do see the wires.  The high voltage wires that...  And they're laughing.  Whoever's filming this video  is laughing.  Run the train.  As people try to get  on the roof of the train.  And this guy's not really  helping them anymore.  And then he just walks...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, yeah, go.  Wow.  He's smoking.  He's smoking dead. 
[03:21:00]  And there's blood.  No, that's fire, too.  His head's on fire.  His head's on fire.  Holy shit.  Is that sick?  And watch that guy  take a quick look  before he boards the train.  Like, he assumes  the train's going to, like...  Yeah, it's going to leave  on time.  It's going to leave on time.  Are we still on schedule?  I've got to say that again.  The guy's on the roof  and he just reaches up.  We'll link this video.  Dead.  Boy, does he just fall  right down, huh?  He gets two shots  and just drops  dead instantly  and then there's a fire 
[03:21:30]  shooting out of his skull.  What, he was just gesturing  and he touched it?  His head is on fire.  Yeah, he didn't mean to touch it.  I think he meant to touch it  thinking it wasn't, you know,  going to do anything.  His head is on fire.  Look at this guy  taking a look  before he boards the train  like, eh, it's burning.  Wow.  Bam.  Bam.  He hit it with his arm first  and then he fell into it  with his head.  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Because he got two shots.  Because the first shot  killed him.  You can see the first shot  is his arm.  The first shot killed him.  The second one  hit him in the head.  That was his head right there. 
[03:22:00]  Oh my boy.  And the way he falls  and his arms are straight up  that instantly killed him.  He never fucking knew  what happened.  You don't think he thought  anything?  Nothing.  He never knew it.  His head, you know how bad  he was...  Probably right there.  Right when he touched it.  Oh, the first one got him.  He felt like something's wrong.  The big flame.  Boink.  Oh, does he go down?  Down goes.  I know it.  I was trying to...  Hassan.  Down goes Strap Hanger. 
[03:22:30]  Look at his head.  And then his head's on fire.  His fucking head is burning.  On fire.  How's your head catch on fire?  It's not very flammable.  And smoke's coming out of his chest?  Yeah.  Wow, is that fucking...  Electricity is a bitch.  No one's going to get him.  What are you going to do with him?  I'll tweet that shit.  What the hell was he thinking?  Why did that guy stop filming her?  That runs a fucking train.  Yeah.  The power in there  has to run a fucking train.  How many...  Or if you want to find it yourself,  it's...  12, 13 volts.  I'd believe you.  I don't know anything about electricity.  No, I would assume that it's a lot of fucking voltage. 
[03:23:00]  I have no clue.  Is that like the third rail?  Yeah, exactly.  Like, if you just touch it,  you're dead instantly?  Yeah.  Done.  All right.  Um...  Wow.  That must have just blew a fucking chunk out of his head, too.  Had to.  Just blew...  Explode a chunk out of his head.  Do you think he touched it, like, twice  because, like, when you touch electricity,  you get stuck to it?  No.  No.  He kind of, like, fell...  He fell...  Yeah, he hit it with his hand.  He was done.  No, it was... 
[03:23:30]  At that point.  He fell into it with his head.  He reached up to grab it.  That got him.  And then I think he was...  He was sort of pulling it down  and then it hit the top of his head.  Did he reach to grab it  or did he just touch it by...  I think he just had his hand on his head.  Well, he was walking on the top of the train.  I think he was walking.  He used it, like, to guide himself, I think.  Thinking it was a fucking, what,  a railing up there?  Amazing.  Oof.  That's fucking hideous.  That cooked him.  Wow.  In a microsecond,  every fucking thing he ever, like,  wanted to be,  every homework assignment he made 
[03:24:00]  or didn't make and...  But, you know,  I think his whole life,  go through his whole life.  See, look.  Ended in a nanosecond.  He grabbed it kind of to guide him.  He grabbed it to kind of guide himself  as he's walking on top of the train  and then go forward.  Look at him, he's lit up.  I think it actually pulled it down a little bit  and then his head hit.  Yeah, and then his head hit.  Wow.  Right there, his head hits.  Look, he's on fire.  His whole body's on fire right there.  Yeah, that thing went right through.  He's grounded.  That power's going from him,  from that wire,  through him to the fucking train. 
[03:24:30]  He's a hurting dude right there.  He's just...  He is the weak circuit breaker.  He is a fuse.  He has become a fuse,  a living fucking fuse.  His head's on fire  and his leg's on fire too?  Yeah.  It shoots right out of here.  His whole body is on fire right there.  220...  And the fall with the arms are just like...  220,000 watts.  Let's go to Paul in India.  Paul.  Yeah, hey man.  How you guys doing?  Hi.  This is in India, right?  Yeah, it is because... 
[03:25:00]  Actually, I'm just sitting here  listening to you guys  and the guy...  He's saying,  Marga, Marga.  What that means is,  he's dead.  He's dead.  Wow.  Very observant.  Are you...  Huh?  No go.  I'm sorry, Paul.  Yeah, so I mean,  I'm just saying,  it is India definitely  because I mean,  I understand the language  and it is 220 volts.  So that...  I mean, over here,  North America is 110.  I understand with this 220,  but it's kind of different.  I don't know if Anthony  knows anything about it. 
[03:25:30]  If you touch the wires over there,  I don't know why would you,  but if you do,  by any chance,  you would get just thrown away.  Wow.  Yeah, it explodes you.  Yeah, yeah.  Amazing.  And there were electricity videos?  That's fun.  You like watching those people  get zapped on them.  But it's so...  It's so...  How come the electric chair,  when they kill you  and the state kills you,  why do they have to keep...  Because they don't want  your fucking head  catching on fire  and pieces of you  being blown out. 
[03:26:00]  They could probably  kill you a lot faster,  but I think they do that  to, you know,  keep you from exploding.  How about they just  stand on a metal floor  and they soup it up to 220  and you're dead in a second.  And then just...  Bam!  Yeah.  Lots of amperage.  They would argue  that it hurts you somehow.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, hey,  I was originally from India.  I was listening to you  talking about Desert Eagle  when I came here  a few months ago.  Uh-huh.  And I went to Vegas  two days ago.  I actually went to the range.  Oh, you shoot one? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, I did, man.  The funny thing is,  you know,  they give you those  target,  you know,  those pictures there?  Oh, what?  What do they put,  the Middle Eastern guys?  No, actually,  they actually had  the one with the hostage  and two culprits.  I missed all of them.  Oh, shit.  You missed them all?  What is this?  Yeah.  They're such a...  Like, the kickback  is unbelievable, man,  you know?  Yeah, it's kind of...  You really got to get used  to shooting that one.  Yeah, but I mean,  I just got to get in.  I just called him.  I love you guys, man.  I come here all the time 
[03:27:00]  and, you know,  first thing I do  is hook up my X-ray, man.  Listen to you guys, man.  You guys rock.  Oh, thank you, Paul.  Our Indian friend, Paul.  Hold on.  Danny found a video  of a guy.  Is that a fish tank, Danny?  No, it's grapes.  This video's been floating around  for a while.  It's just...  I never pulled it  because it's in Spanish.  So it just...  I mean, it makes sense now  because you guys  are watching electric...  Electrocution videos.  Why would there be  electrical grapes?  You know, I don't know.  I think it was part  of, like, the lighting system.  Oh, okay.  And, like, something  just was exposed or whatever.  He just touched it  in the wrong area.  He's at some kind  of a function.  He makes a great  little sound, though. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, does he?  Jump up.  Hey.  Ay-yi!  Ay-yi!  Is he alive?  Yeah, I think he was all right.  Wait, the grapes are hanging  from some kind of wall  and there was electricity  going through?  Yeah, I don't really know.  It's a weird setup.  It looked like some kind  of a function.  And then he was touching  the grapes.  Estas mais de mesa.  Aqui do lado, pederneiras.  Aqui, por exemplo, 
[03:28:00]  tem...  Ay-yi!  Let go, you...  Ay-yi!  How bad.  He shit and pissed himself.  Oh, yeah.  How bad do you want  to let go  when you first  touch something like that?  All your mind is saying  is open your hand.  Please open your hand.  God damn.  That's funny.  That's something.  Holy shit.  Ay-yi!  Let's talk to someone  who works for Amtrak.  Dave in D.C.  Dave?  Hey, yeah, 
[03:28:30]  I work for Amtrak in D.C.  The pan wires  are 17,000 volts  and, yeah,  it's pretty much instant  dead whenever you touch.  I'm an electrician, so...  Oh, yeah.  You're done.  How about if you had  a wrench  and you touched  the metal to it  and you were  holding the wrench?  Ted?  We had a guy  last year,  he was climbing up  a ladder.  He put a ladder  up against one  of the engines  and was trying  to cut a ground  strap on the  panograph.  The thing that goes  up and down  to touch the wires,  they get the voltage  to the train. 
[03:29:00]  And he climbed up  there,  put a wrench,  well,  the guide cutters  on the ground  strap and blow  him off the train.  Wow.  Blow him like 20 feet,  something like that.  People who work  on those wires  for a living,  how do they know  that they're off?  We cut them out.  There's switches  that we can throw  and it'll put a  ground strap up to it  and cut it out  of the circuit.  You ever see  the guys that work  on those real  fucking high towers  where they bring  them over  with the helicopter?  Yeah,  and they have  some kind of metal 
[03:29:30]  like a rod  that kind of  directs electricity  towards it  so that they  could safely work?  Yeah,  the guy actually  has to get out  on this plank  on the side  of a helicopter  and take this rod  and discharge the wire  with this fucking  metal rod  before they could  drop him off  on the wire.  Wait,  what's he doing?  He works on those  high tension wires  like the real  fucking tall towers  that go up  hundreds of feet  where like major  fucking electricity  is going through  these things.  And yeah,  the guy like  comes out the door 
[03:30:00]  and he's on this  platform,  this thin little  platform,  and he takes  a metal pole  and discharges  the wire.  But how does  that discharge it?  It's hooked  to a strap  or something.  Here's the guy.  Look at this  sick shit  this guy is doing.  This is his job?  This is this guy's  fucking job.  He's on the skid  of this little  helicopter  going up  to work  on these  power lines  that are  a couple of  hundred feet  in the air, 
[03:30:30]  these fucking  things.  And they got  to stop the  copter close  but not  too close  or else  it'll arc  to the  helicopter.  It's like a  weird fucking  thing going on.  Because electricity  is right on the  outside of it,  right?  Yeah,  yeah.  So look at  what he does.  He has a  wire.  Yeah.  And he's  got to like  touch the  fucking  say  he's touching  he's got the  wire next to it.  What he's doing  is he's putting  the charge  into himself. 
[03:31:00]  The wire  is off  and he's  putting the  static charge  into himself  the same  to uh  so he's  positively  charged  and now  he can get  on the  wire in  this little  fucking  seat  and work  up there.  That's what  he does.  He just  shocked himself?  He actually  made him  himself  positively  charged.  So he's  the same  as the  wires.  Is that  healthy for 
[03:31:30]  your organs?  How could  it be?  And now  he's just  hanging from  a helicopter  and now  he steps  off the  copter.  He's on  the fucking  wires and  this is his  job.  He better  make a  billion billion  dollars.  Hold on a  second.  And the  helicopter has  to leave.  How much  do you think  his health  insurance is?  Oh forget  about it.  He's hanging  in between  crawling on  the wires.  It's the  dumbest thing 
[03:32:00]  I've ever  seen.  What job  is this?  Wouldn't  you just  go back  and go  I took  care of  the  wires  and  there's  another  guy  on the  other  wire.  How are you  doing Fred?  Hi Tom.  They're passing  each other on  the wires.  He's crawling  on his hands  and knees  but in  between  two wires  probably  70 feet  in the air.  Is it  easy to  do that  you think?  No!  How could  it be?  There's  fucking  electricity  going through  you.  They're  picking up  the other  guy now.  They're  picking up  the  helicopter  guy.  He's  picking up  the other  one.  So he's  tied to  it so  he falls.  So he's  going over  by the  tower by  the  insulator. 
[03:32:30]  And now  what is  he going  to do?  They drop  you off  on the  middle  wire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the  middle  wire because  they can't  drop you  off by  the  insulator.  So now  he's got  to do  some  work  over  there.  Now  you see  the  electric  charge?  Now  he's  recharging  himself so  he can  touch  the  helicopter.  Is he  cutting  through  electricity?  No it's  just  discharging.  Even when  you shut  the power  off of  those lines  they're 
[03:33:00]  still  charged  with  static  electricity.  So the  power's  off?  The  power's  off.  It's  really  fucking  sick.  I'd love  to know  the first  guy they  brought up  to do  that  who  just  said  it's  off  I'm  okay.  He had  a fucking  metal  hat.  How do  they find  this out  there  Danny?  Lineman  says I  got it  wrong.  I might.  I don't  know.  I watched  the show  and I  was amazed.  Go to  John from  Philly.  Just google  a high  voltage  wire worker.  Oh that 
[03:33:30]  guy.  Frank what's  up?  Hey I  started with  a guy that  decided to  climb up  the high  tension  tower when  he was  about seven  years old  and swing  from one  of the  wires.  He fell  about 75  feet and  eventually  lost his  arm.  The guy  is not  quite right  in the  head if  you know  what I  mean.  Who  are those  guys that  work?  I saw  a show  it was  on Discovery  or one  of those.  The structure 
[03:34:00]  is 2,000  feet.  It's almost  twice the  height of  what the  twin towers  were.  And it's  a radio  tower.  We've seen  all the radio  towers.  But there's  a big  transmitter on  the top and  when they  have to  replace that.  What a  motherfucker  of an  operation it  is.  You're  2,000  feet in  the air  tied to  something  that could  just fall  off.  John and  PA, we're  going to  learn a  little more  about this.  John?  Hey, Ant,  just want to  correct you  there.  That wire  is energized.  It's a  live wire? 
[03:34:30]  It is a  live wire.  And what  they do  with the  helicopter,  when he  connects to  that wire,  he has the  same potential  as that  wire.  If they  get within  10 to  15 feet  of the  pole  standard,  they're  going to  ground.  They're  dead.  So they're  actually putting  the energy  field around  the entire  helicopter.  Oh, right.  Okay, now I  remember that  because I saw  it a while  ago.  Yeah, they're  putting the  entire energy 
[03:35:00]  field around  the helicopter.  Correct.  How sick  is that?  Well, if he  reached out  while he was  working on  that and  touched the  tower,  he's  instantly  smoked.  Right.  Wait.  So that's  usually, it's  usually like  those wires  are 250  kVA, 250,000  volts.  So do they  stop the  power when  he has to  work on  it?  Say that  again, Jim?  Like when  they have to  say he has  to do  something on  those wires,  they don't  turn the  power off?  No, they  can't.  They would  shut down  some of 
[03:35:30]  those supply  major cities  like New  York City.  So he's  got to work  on live  wires.  Yes, sir.  But they  got to charge  like the  helicopter and  the guy  first.  Correct.  So he goes  up there.  What would  you do on  a live  wire?  What would  he have  to do?  Why would  he go,  all right,  you've got to  drop him off  in the middle  there.  What would  he have to  do?  They might  be changing  the insulators  out,  possibly one  might have  hit by  lightning or  something like  that,  or they  just have  to short  the wires  up again, 
[03:36:00]  just check  connections,  make sure  everything's  cool.  So does  he feel  weird or  a little  off while  he's doing  that,  or does  he feel  perfectly  normal?  That I  don't know.  I don't  deal with  that much  electricity,  so I  would imagine  it would  probably  tingle a  little bit.  Is your  hair standing  up?  Do you  feel stupid?  He feels  stupid.  He's wearing  like a  ridiculous  suit,  too.  Yeah.  And plus  they're at  150 feet  in the air  and they  can also  fall.  He seems  like he  was chained  tied up  to the  thing with  some sort 
[03:36:30]  of a  pulley.  Those  never  fail.  How about  the nerves  of the  helicopter  pilot?  He's  got to be  one hell  of a  pilot  to keep  that  thing  steady.  I'd be  fucking  out of  my mind.  Punch it  out,  boys.  Good  job there.  Good call,  John.  That's a sick  shit,  man.  You can  feel your  hair  stand up  on you.  God damn.  I want to  see a video  of the  guys.  What kind  of job  is this?  I don't,  why would  you do,  like who 
[03:37:00]  looks up  at those  wires and  goes,  boy,  I want  to sit  up there  with a  wrench  or a  fucking  hammer.  And it's  right by  a nuclear  power plant.  Look at  this fucking,  these guys  just love  danger.  It's amazing  how women  will fuck  cops.  All you  ladies should  do is  blow  maniacs  like this.  If you  want a  man's  man,  fuck  fireman,  this guy  goes up  on live  electricity  and fucking  hangs out.  He's just  swinging off  a helicopter,  heading toward  the live  wires.  Electrical  towers.  You can  see the  nuclear  power plant  right there.  In the  background.  What does  he do  for fun?  He's got  all the 
[03:37:30]  features.  How do  you stimulate  yourself after  you do  this for a  living?  Just fucking  stick your  tongue into  light sockets.  He's only  having fun  if he's  playing  fucking  having a  catch with  some old  dynamite.  That's his  idea.  I want  to see  footage of  those guys  that change  out those  radio tower  things.  Those guys  are 2,000  feet in the  air.  It's terrifying.  Someone wants  to know how  did the birds  stay in the  lines?  Don't they  get shit  zapped?  They're not  grounded. 
[03:38:00]  They're just  flying from  the air?  Yeah.  It's like if a  wire falls on  your car and  you're sitting  in the car,  you're fine.  But the  second you  step out and  touch the  ground and  the car,  you're fucked.  But that's  what we  would do.  Every single  one of us  would get  out of the  car.  You're supposed  to stay in  the car.  Oh, fuck.  Unless the  car's on fire.  Then you've  got to take a  flying leap from  the doorway to  the ground without  touching the  car.  So wait, if you  open the door and  you jump out and  you're in mid-air for  a split second,  then you land on 
[03:38:30]  the ground, you're  okay.  Then you're  in mid-air.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you step  out...  As long as you're  far enough away where  when you touch the  ground, it won't  arc between you and  the car.  You could get  shocked without  being...  Without exactly  touching it.  How far, though?  They tell you just  stay in the  fucking vehicle.  You've got to get  away fucking...  I don't know how  far, but...  More than two  feet?  Yeah, I would say.  It depends on how  much voltage is...  Just drive away. 
[03:39:00]  What the fuck  are you hanging out  for talking?  We're out.  Ron and Fez  next.  Yes.  Mars has to get in  here and do some  maintenance.  The instant feedback  is down.  I don't know.  He's got to do  some tweaking here.  Yeah, it's a wreck.  Marcel S. had a  great line when we  were talking about  Uncle Paul and  old school rap.  What happened?  And he's from  Rhode Island.  He writes,  Uncle Paul should  sing, parents just  don't understand.  Uh-oh.  They sure don't.  Hey, you want to  play Kevin from  Connecticut's  shitting into  cups?  Yeah, that was  fun. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, let's play  this as we leave  today.  We're digging that  drinking out of  cups.  And Kevin did a  show version of  that thing.  That's very good.  We're going to  meet Felice Johnson  tomorrow there, Danny.  All right.  Don't forget, we  meet Felice Johnson  tomorrow.  No way.  No way, no  hell.  No how.  This is Kevin from  Connecticut doing a  good job for the  show.  We'll see you guys  tomorrow.  What does this guy  think?  He's an angelfish?  Is he a goddamn  asshole?  What the fuck is he  doing?  Not ever.  No way.  Now he's Kenny 
[03:40:00]  angelfish face.  Hammering away like  he's frigging Tommy  Throwdown.  What the hell is he  doing?  Thinks he's got to go  and bust it over.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage?  What is this?  Oh, I'm king of the  boners.  I'm the Cialis  Meister.  I show you my  tent.  Well, sometimes I  fronk us like the  burka.  You're right.  You're right.  This guy's a faggot.  This guy's some sort  of faggot hoagie on  the fridgy ride.  This guy thinks he's  Captain Mayo. 
[03:40:30]  Thinks he's Captain  Garlic Butter Sauce.  When everyone needs  some halitosis they go  to him.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  He's such a bitch.  Thinks he's Miss  Cinnamon.  Shitting in two cups.  Being a bitch.  I better fist.  I better fisk.  Barg.  Little twink in the  background.  I'm fucking going  crazy.  Who's this guy?  Mr. Hobo  Kisser?  Mr. Man  Kiss?  No way.  No way.  Get real.  Like those things  in Mr. Hallway. 
[03:41:00]  Mr. Run  Down Me on the  hallway.  Lead me to the  studio.  Fuck you.  Five, six, four,  three.  You're right.  Here's some hair  plug, bitch.  Who pays for that  gun?  Not me.  No way.  Never paying for  no gun ever again.  Not once.  Not never.  Nope.  Whose pair of  capris is that?  Who brought that  goddamn flame shirt  here?  That's not my  blouse.  Not my blouse.  Not my problem.  That's what I say.  No way.  Stupid foundry.  Stupid logo. 
[03:41:30]  Satellites rule.  If you don't like  the satellite, you  suck.  What is this?  Captain Giveaway?  What, a money  party?  Who didn't invite  me?  Why didn't I get  invited, Timmy  Ten Grand?  What is this?  Get real.  I'm in love with  the outcasts.  I'm in love with  them.  They're so beautiful  and cute.  I'm in love with  the rejects.  They're fucking  unreal.  I love them.  They're like all  the Wednesday tits.  I love them.  I love boobs.  I love looking at  them.  I love decoupage.  I love decoupage 
[03:42:00]  things.  I love things  with wiffle ball  bats and phones  on them, like  blankets and towels  and little bags.  I love them.  ONA forever. </pre>
