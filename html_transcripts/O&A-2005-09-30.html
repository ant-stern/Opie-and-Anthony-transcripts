<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their usual vulgar banter, targeting their staff, Ben and Steve.  The conversation quickly shifted to a televised wildfire, sparking a discussion about natural disasters and media coverage.  They speculated on the historical choices of city locations, questioning early settlers’ consideration of weather patterns.  Listeners Shane (Florida) and Mike (New York) called in to discuss the wildfire and the possibility of New York earthquakes, respectively.

Jim Norton then called in from Los Angeles, describing his new apartment's unsettling odor and fly infestation, speculating about a previous death. He mentioned upcoming filming for an HBO series and his new nickname, "The Disciplinarian," before transitioning to a detailed discussion of Natalia (or Natalie) McLennan, a high-profile escort, recounting his past encounters with her and other escorts.

A large portion of the show recounted a disastrous pitch meeting with A&E for a "Mythbusters" meets "Jackass" style show, highlighting the awkwardness and embarrassment of the experience.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, sports commentators, and the Red Sox curse. A listener-submitted remix of the *Shining* trailer was briefly played and discussed.

The sports discussion continued, focusing on the cyclical nature of sports fandom and the negativity in sports journalism, particularly targeting Phil Mushnick.  The hosts mocked superstitious fans and compared the experiences of fans of various teams, highlighting the struggles of Cleveland Indians, Milwaukee Brewers, and Chicago Cubs fans, contrasting them with Yankees and Red Sox fans. Numerous calls from listeners, many from Cleveland and Chicago, followed, sharing their frustrations.  The conversation included mentions of Derek Jeter, David Ortiz, LeBron James, the Steve Bartman incident, and the Billy Goat Curse.  A heated exchange between Bill Burr (Red Sox fan, in studio) and one of the hosts (Yankees fan) occurred.  The segment also covered Bill Burr's temporary departure, plans for a Halloween party with live music and a costume contest, and a recent Washington Post article about the hosts and the launch of XM radio on DirecTV.  Profanity was heavily used throughout this segment.

The show then moved to the hosts' experiences joining XM Satellite Radio, noting the surprising lack of recognition from industry figures like Bob Edwards.  They described XM employee Eric Logan.  A phone call with Evangeline followed, initiating the "Guess What's in My Pants" game, involving sexually suggestive descriptions and crude commentary from the hosts about Evangeline’s physique. Opie accidentally hung up on her.  A subsequent conversation with Chris from "The Apprentice" ensued, focusing on his elimination and the Lamborghini advertising challenge, including playing clips of Marcus.  The conversation returned to Evangeline (who remained nude), only to be interrupted by a call from Bill Burr promoting a gig.  The hosts continued making sexually suggestive comments and discussed the "Assault on the Media" contest entries from Boston, Buffalo, and Philadelphia. The contest winner was announced, and celebrity voicemails congratulating XM on reaching 5 million subscribers were played.

The next segment highlighted the "Assault on the Media" contest entries from Philadelphia, Boston, and Buffalo, with staff voting on the best entry.  A call with the naked Evangeline followed, featuring sexually suggestive questions and an "ass test."  Bill, the intern, explained his lateness due to drinking.  A call with Chuck Farnham discussed the annual James Dean fan gathering.  The show concluded with a call from Danny Bonaduce, who discussed his VH1 show, "Breaking Bonaduce," including steroid injections, his marriage, past boxing matches (including one with Barry Williams), substance abuse struggles, and career challenges.

A lengthy interview with Danny Bonaduce followed, covering his recent radio firing, his VH1 show *Breaking Bonaduce* (including a high-speed chase and an incident with a transvestite prostitute), his appearance on *The View*, and a potential lawsuit from his former co-host, Jamie White.  The "Guess What's in My Pants" game with a Canadian caller followed. The show concluded with discussions of their charity auction ($50,000 raised), more banter with Bill Burr, and further jokes about various topics and personalities.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Well, we're waiting.  Wildfire is out of control. 
[00:05:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  There's a guy on his roof with a hose.  Trying to save his house.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  I love that shot.  Sucks that you're worried about your house going up in flames.  But you and a hose against nature.  Nature wins every time.  Look at these people.  They just got hoses in their backyard. 
[00:05:30]  And they're just hoping that's going to prevent their house from being the next one that...  That's swallowed.  That's swallowed.  That's what you need.  You need the helicopter.  Look at that.  Bam!  Those things drop a lot of shit on fires.  That fire is heading right for that neighborhood.  And there's really...  You know, as far as the wind goes, there's nothing they can do about it.  There is not enough fire trucks they can just spray.  He's got his thumb over the end of the hose.  Oh, he did?  I didn't say...  I thought he was just having that little arc of water go down there. 
[00:06:00]  No, no.  He had to spray in it.  Oh, he's got no worries at all.  Yeah.  He's fine.  This is the latest disaster because we're...  He's fine and dandy.  Get that green garden hose going.  I guess the hurricane coverage is done.  Now it's all about fires.  Fire.  They love any disaster.  You get these regional disasters.  California is great for the fires.  They are just great.  Fires, landslides, an occasional earthquake pops up. 
[00:06:30]  The news loves it.  Now it's the fires.  What do we get, really?  Aside from, you know, the once-in-a-lifetime terrorism.  I'm trying to think, what do we get?  We don't really have the big natural disasters here.  No, not really.  Dude, what are you doing?  I'm jinxing it for everybody and just hoping something happens.  Slow news.  We need news to fuel the show.  Disaster fuels the show.  We've been great lately.  We don't get any of them natural disasters, do we? 
[00:07:00]  I don't recall any.  This is the last time we had a tornado.  No tornadoes, no hurricanes, no fires.  The hurricanes get here.  It's rain with wind.  Tornadoes, you occasionally hear about, you know, in Jersey.  The tornado struck in Jersey.  Yeah, but it's always in the middle of nowhere.  It's not like Jersey.  Yeah, it's not making its way through Newark or something.  It's always way northeastern New Jersey or south Jersey or something like that.  Our forefathers just knew where to build shit in this country. 
[00:07:30]  Except New Orleans.  You notice that?  Yeah.  Like, why didn't we put New York City where New Orleans is?  That would have been a disaster waiting to happen.  But someone, a long time ago, just figured it out.  Do you think they actually took the weather into consideration?  Hell yeah.  Or the fact that, man, there's a lot of waterways to get to this city?  Hell yeah.  They got that all figured out.  Do you think they figured it out way back then?  A long time ago.  They brought some wizard out and he said,  The weather here is wonderful. 
[00:08:00]  Like, they knew anything about where tornadoes were, what they were, what caused them, areas where they don't get them.  I was thinking that shit, even like 25 years ago before basic cable, I mean, that hurricane just would have happened.  They would have been saying that it was coming, but as far as us knowing about it, it all would have been on the front page, like, you know, after all this shit happened.  You'd be like, oh, wow, look what happened.  Front page of the paper, or in the nightly news, you'd get, like, grainy film from it. 
[00:08:30]  Like, no video feed live.  It was like they would film it and then ship it up to the affiliates.  The cheesy graphic over his shoulder that just says, Hurricane, written in scary letters.  And now we watch it in real time.  That was their only graphic, yeah.  Hurricane, and it kind of was shaky a little bit.  Yeah, the shaky writing.  That's right, very good.  Clock behind him.  You'll know what time it is.  Yeah, the news really sucked.  Yeah, remember that?  Man slain, and then they would have just the silhouette of somebody, like, laying on the ground. 
[00:09:00]  Now they, like, fucking, they literally show, like, his nostrils.  Yeah, 0.8 seconds after the crime.  The guy's still falling to the ground.  Right there.  A man was killed two days ago.  And they showed the silhouette.  That was it.  Now, yeah, up to the minute.  Oh, we must have wanted it.  All right, let's say hi to Shane in Florida.  Shane, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  Happy 5 million plus 14. 
[00:09:30]  Wait, plus 14?  Yeah, DirecTV.  You got 19 million new listeners.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, that DirecTV deal that XM made yesterday is huge for us.  Yeah, congratulations on that.  Hey, Los Alamos, New Mexico, a couple years ago, place burned down.  One guy's house was standing, and all these that burned down, he was all happy until the new houses went up.  And everybody had new houses, and this last guy standing was all pissed because his house wasn't worth as much.  Now, how's that for a story, huh?  Tell that guy with the hose to just shut the hose off and remove the thumb. 
[00:10:00]  He's just on his roof with the hose hoping that's going to take care of it, and that'll do it.  You kind of feel bad for the guy.  You know what I think?  I'm kind of mulling your theory over in my head, Opie, your whole theory of they built the cities where they would be safe.  I think it was more that back then they just built a bunch of them everywhere,  and whichever ones are still there are the ones that didn't get all fucked up because they built them where the weather was.  I don't know about that.  Like, there could have been this thriving metropolis in the middle of the country somewhere 
[00:10:30]  that they really thought was going to take off, and a tornado comes through, wipes it out,  and they go, okay, we're moving on.  Yeah, it just keeps knocking it down.  Yeah.  Like knocking it down, they just said, fuck it.  And then you move on and go, all right, let's try it here.  Let's try it here, and then they went to the Gulf Coast maybe, big hurricane comes in, wipes them out,  and go, no, we can't really make a major city here.  Are you trying to say there was, like, a huge, like, city as large as New York City, let's say, in the middle of Arizona?  I think it would. 
[00:11:00]  You're saying Kansas would have been a cultural meckle.  Right.  I said meckle.  What a meckle.  A meckle.  The meckle heads that built meckle.  I think they were a little like, fucking idiot.  There was a potential for there to be a thriving city there.  But early on, that little sprout was knocked down.  A little known fact, the United States owned Montreal for a day or two.  We needed that crap, right?  Well, then we realized, what are we doing?  It's too cold. 
[00:11:30]  Stinks.  We don't need this.  Too cold.  So we pretty much just gave that away.  That's why the UN isn't in, like, Fargo.  You know, because it's just too cold.  Can't really get there all the time.  So they put it here, where people work every day, get stuck in traffic anyway.  But they weren't planning on that way back then.  They were just happy.  You know, they built New York City.  Nothing knocked it over.  And it continued.  Right.  I think that's more the theory than some very smart people back then going, 
[00:12:00]  as I look at my satellite photo, I see this area is free.  All right.  That's a good point, too.  Hey, on the instant feedback, someone's writing,  you guys should call Joe Rogan.  His house is right in the path of the fire.  He says there are fire trucks in his driveway right now.  Joe don't care, though.  He'll just buy another one.  Carlos Mencia started that fire.  The Punisher.  I show you.  I'm the Punisher.  We're going to have to ask him about his nickname when he comes in next week. 
[00:12:30]  Of course we are.  First question.  Because now it does sound kind of silly.  Who calls you the Punisher?  Have him give you a list of names of what comedians actually call him the Punisher.  Right.  Who made it up?  How did you hear that they were calling you the Punisher?  Who's walking up to you saying,  Hey, Punisher.  Mr. Punisher.  Does his mail say resident or Mr. Punisher?  Mr. Punisher or current resident?  Even if comedians believe that, they wouldn't do it because you're admitting defeat. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I'm just Joe Blow.  This guy.  Yeah.  He's the Punisher.  He's the Punisher.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York real fast.  And then Jimmy Norton's on hold.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  I just wanted to remind you that we're kind of sitting on a major fault line here in New York.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's one of those that they talk about and try to scare you.  And sorry, it ain't good.  But I saw a news tease maybe a year ago that we are sitting on one and it could happen here in New York. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, of course it can.  Sure it is.  I didn't watch the news that night, but you know.  Yeah.  If it ever happens, it'll happen way, way, way in the future.  We'll all be long gone.  I wouldn't worry about the fault lines.  It's just the geography of the East Coast isn't conducive to earthquakes.  It just isn't.  There isn't that moving plate shit going on where there's fault lines,  but there's not this tremendous amount of pressure between the two plates, 
[00:14:00]  like just going, yeah, just waiting to snap.  Yeah, there's fault lines and they're just sitting there.  They're like cracks.  Jesus.  We get a slight shake every once in a while.  We're sitting on a major fault line.  What could this mean for New York?  Nothing.  You get a slight shake and then you've got a report that some housewife in Bayshore felt something.  I felt something.  Yeah, great.  I felt something and a lamp moved.  I dropped my spoon.  Yeah, nothing.  California, meanwhile, you know, highways are collapsing in San Francisco. 
[00:14:30]  That's an earthquake.  Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  There he is.  Jim Norton live from Los Angeles, California.  Oh, it's so early, Jimmy.  It's 4.15 in the morning.  Now I'm, by the way, call me by my new name, the Disciplinarian.  Oh.  Wow, a bunch of comics gave you that name?  Yeah, you know, they talk about me and I'm there.  He disciplines people.  Yeah, we're all trying to come up with a nickname for each other.  So I'm either going to go with the Destroyer or the Instigator. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  Yeah, I know.  Whatever.  That's fine.  Hey, where are these fires out there?  Do you know?  You know, it's funny, man.  Funny story.  I actually, they said there was fires burning and I could see a little white flecks, which  I didn't know what they were, but I think it was like embers or smoke or something.  Like, it was just in the air from the fires.  Are they close?  Really?  Falling down around where you are, huh?  I mean, really light, though.  It looked like a mild, teeny, teeny snow.  You hardly notice it until you look through the headlights. 
[00:15:30]  You're like, oh, yeah.  And the only good thing is that guy, remember I told you that awful apartment I looked at  in the guy's house where he had his music equipment?  Yeah.  I'm hoping his house burned.  That's the only bit of a fire.  And maybe all of his possessions are on the side of a mountain and he died face first in  the mud.  How's the sore throat?  It's better, actually.  I just took another antibiotic.  I was in a call yesterday, man.  I have late calls.  Yeah? 
[00:16:00]  You there?  Jim.  Jimmy?  Is this a new bit?  Like anything?  I'm just going to, like, in the middle of a conversation, stop talking.  Damn it.  He hung up on us.  Well, fuck him.  You are the new permanent third man, Bill, because we can't be hung up on.  They call me the substitutes.  Just repeat after me.  I'm Bill Burr, and I'm on the radio.  So we can't do that.  That's all you need.  So we can throw that into the open.  Well, we want to talk to Jim about his hooker. 
[00:16:30]  His hooker went to Rikers.  Oh, here he is.  Yeah.  Big story in the paper today.  We'll get into that and a few other things.  So you're feeling better, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got shitty cell connection here.  I'm in my new pad, as I like to call it.  Oh!  How is that?  It's a studio in Los Feliz, or however you say it, Los Feliz.  Oh, boy.  It's like seven miles from where I'm working.  Not even.  It's great.  But I came in to look at the apartment, and there were flies on the window inside. 
[00:17:00]  There was like 20 flies on the inside of my apartment.  Like Amityville Horror?  Dude, that's exactly what it was like.  And I'm starting to think something bad happened here, because there's like, you know, like  those little vases filled with oil, and they have like those little sticks coming out of  them, and they give up a nice scent, and they kind of like, for a roomless freshener.  Yeah, I've heard of that.  They had a really strong one in here, and there were flies on the window, and I came in today,  and there were more flies in here.  Oh, dude, there was a body in there.  Dude, that's what I'm starting to think.  Yeah.  It's a small little studio, but I'm like, there's this sickly smell. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Someone died in your apartment.  Dude, I don't know what it is.  I'm not even being paranoid, but because of the flies were all concentrated on the window,  they were all inside the apartment, right by this part by the window, and the thing was  open.  They could have flown out whenever they wanted to, and they didn't fly out.  Jimmy, did you Google your address?  Oh, no.  Yeah, do that, because sometimes that turns up a crime or murder or death that might have 
[00:18:00]  taken place in the residence.  Are your neighbors, like, avoiding eye contact with you?  No, I haven't seen any of my neighbors.  There's only my phone.  Oh, that makes sense.  That makes sense.  Oh, my God.  Somebody got their brains blown out, and they sprayed across the window.  I thought of that, man.  There was a bludgeoning, or there was something soft and red leaked out of somebody onto that  window because the flies were digging it.  Oh, man.  This is my first night in the apartment, so I'm kind of creeped out by that.  Scary.  You're going to be sitting on the bed like that scene in Big, when he was all scared, 
[00:18:30]  sitting in the hotel, crying with the sirens going fast, pulling his knees into his chest.  Yeah, yeah.  Just wanting his mommy.  How's the taping going, Jimmy?  It's great, dude.  I'm really happy.  I mean, we shot last night, and we shoot tomorrow night, but this week has been great, too.  So far, so good.  My acting is getting better, so I'm kind of happy.  I thought they were going to fire me.  Yeah, you're bringing the tone of your voice down a little bit.  Dude, I was doing something today where I had to actually point a weapon at somebody 
[00:19:00]  in the scene, and I'm like, how do you just look like that?  And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing, stupid?  I started doing my awful raise the voice because you can't act acting.  Put your hands in the air.  Don't make me shoot you.  I open my eyes really wide sometimes, too, like to try to pretend I have expression.  I'm like, what are you doing now?  Is that show going to be on BET?  That's great. 
[00:19:30]  Open his eyes.  The only expression.  Hey, guys, what time are we coming back tomorrow?  The show is good.  The scripts are great, and they're very happy with the way things are going.  Yeah, you got any complete yet?  Oh, yeah.  We've shot one.  We're on our second one now.  We shoot over tonight.  And then next week we do the third one.  And then I come back.  I was going to come back Monday, but I'm coming back Tuesday because I'm doing actually the  Tonight Show on Monday.  Oh.  Oh, wow. 
[00:20:00]  So we'll have you Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then...  Nice.  A week from this coming Tuesday, Jimmy returns.  You know who I'm doing it with?  You know the chick that played the lead in Pirates of the Caribbean?  Yeah.  She's pretty hot, right?  Yeah.  She's really hot.  I may try to ask her for coffee.  What do you think?  Good luck, bro.  Take her back to your smelly, fly-ridden apartment.  Yeah, exactly.  Just push her face where the other body was and just sodomize her brutally and laugh while 
[00:20:30]  the bugs attack her.  And there's this group called The Killers, who I never heard of.  Do you guys know who they are?  Yeah, The Killers are huge.  Oh, yeah.  That's what the guy told me, but I never heard of them.  But these are very popular.  They're one of the biggest bands of the past year.  You should get a picture.  No, Ozzy, but, you know.  No, they're really good.  I'm serious.  You might like their stuff.  You should download a couple tunes.  Hold on, guys.  Fuck.  What happened?  Can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm just a cell connection as shit.  I'm getting a home phone soon, like next Wednesday.  Oh, you are?  Oh, the phone guy is going to come in and hook it up and go, yeah, we just took a phone 
[00:21:00]  out of here.  You should have seen.  Any hookers, Jimmy?  Dude, that's why I'm still awake.  I was just out riding around because I kind of found a couple of spots just by accident.  Yeah, by accident?  No, dude, on my way home, I saw a couple.  I was just driving home.  This is a new way for me to come home.  Are they real chicks or, you know?  Yeah, you got to weed through them.  There's a couple of different areas.  It's like where the trannies are, it's like a main drag on the way, right on the way up  to my fucking place, like two miles from where I am. 
[00:21:30]  Lucky ducky.  No, I'm avoiding them.  You got to go down like Hollywood Boulevard a little bit and hook it up on some side streets  to find like the regular chicks.  I've done Craigs a few times from Craigslist.  Yeah, what's the quality compared to the East Coast?  Not bad.  I mean, I've had good success so far.  Can you guys hear me?  Yeah, of course.  Okay, get my phone.  I keep hearing some little background noise.  A ghost.  No, it's not a ghost.  Dude, don't tell me that.  I'm all fucking weird as hell.  I know you are, and well, you should be. 
[00:22:00]  I'm fucking Larry Lonely calling my friends and hoping the sun will come up before we get  off the phone.  I can kind of hear it in your voice.  I know.  You're a little freaked out.  A little Jimmy's scared.  He's a little freaked out.  A little scared.  Jimmy, a serious question.  If you get arrested, is that going to fuck up your deal out there?  You know, that is exactly why I'm here right now.  I fucking said, what are you doing, you psychopath?  Get back to the apartment.  Because I forgot my phone, and I'm riding around.  I'm not doing anything wrong. 
[00:22:30]  I'm just kind of, you know, I'm just looking around, you know.  Uh-huh.  You know what?  Just shopping.  His voice just went up during his alibi.  You're not doing anything wrong.  I'm not doing anything.  You hear those guys all the time on cops.  You know what?  What?  I'm not doing anything.  You know what's great?  When this HBO series finally airs, you know, the National Enquirer and all those rag magazines,  they pick apart everybody.  Oh, they love it when celebrities trip on their own dicks.  And the stories are going to come up for Jim Norton that we all know already.  Yeah, we've heard of them.  It's going to just be hilarious that it's going to be available for the entire country.  You know what it is?  They'll probably fucking fuck up with nice stories. 
[00:23:00]  Because they'll ask me, what do you like to do?  I'll say, well, I picked up some crannies, and I'll actually have to have women come out of the woodwork  that admitted I was nice to them.  That'll be the shocker.  That'll be the scandal.  Because I remember when Voss was, you know, doing his thing there, you know,  they even had stories on him in the National Enquirer, how he used to smoke crack and stuff.  Yeah.  The old Voss.  Yeah, boy, that fucking ended quickly, didn't it?  That National Enquirer coverage.  Yeah, no shit.  Hey, your hooker went to Rikers yesterday. 
[00:23:30]  Dude, I know.  Ben just told me, like, when I first called in, he got on.  I'm bummed out to hear that, man.  I can't believe I fucked her, though.  I'm so proud of myself.  Yeah.  Thank you, boys.  Thank you, boys.  That was all because of you that that happened.  She went to jail crying.  Well, I want to bring everyone up to speak, because we have a lot of new listeners.  This escort service was just a...  They were huge fans of the show, and they gave us all a free hour.  Jimmy was the only one that we know of that actually partook in the free hour, and the 
[00:24:00]  guy that ran the company, he's been in Rikers for a while now, because he was just bragging  way too much to the media and everybody else, and bringing his hookers on a national talk  show like ours.  And then Jimmy spent a night, or more than a night, no, Jim?  No, no, no.  It was only one section I had with her.  It was one section.  Yeah, and you got the ass flu from her, remember?  I did.  I did either ask, but I didn't have a flu right after.  I mean, you might be right after that.  We dubbed it the ass flu, yes.  The ass flu, and these girls were coming in in the early days of XM, and they were really  just bragging how much money they're making and how hot they were. 
[00:24:30]  And this one, Natalie.  Natalie or Natalia?  Natalia, right?  Natalia.  She would get $2,000 an hour, and it was a two-hour minimum.  And Jimmy...  Freebie.  Jimmy got a freebie, yeah.  So it was a big deal on our show, and so Jason, who ran the company, he got busted  a while ago, and they were trying to nail Natalia, and they finally got her, and she went  off to Rikers yesterday, I guess.  Yeah.  She was claiming to be the number one escort. 
[00:25:00]  Well, there's a lot of expensive escorts, dude.  Like, I told you, in Florida, the one girl and her boyfriend who liked the show hooked  me up.  She runs an escort agency, and she hooked me up with like a $1,500 an hour hooker who  did like fire things with her asshole in porn movies, some really weird stuff.  Fabulous.  Yeah.  So, I mean, there's a lot of girls that charge that much, but Natalia was just very high profile,  and she should have just kind of kept quiet, you know?  You can't fucking brag about that shit.  No, she went on bragging, man.  She was on TV bragging about it.  Yeah.  I mean, she just got out of control. 
[00:25:30]  Did interviews.  It says Natalie McLennan, I guess that's her name, her brown eyes filled with tears, and  her body convulsed in sobs as Manhattan Supreme Court guards handcuffed her and hauled her  off to Rikers Island.  She was not merely a call girl, argued the prosecutor, Jeffrey Davis.  He charges McLennan, known in the underworld sex trade as Natalia, held a managerial position  and hired and fired prostitutes for an escort company called New York Confidential. 
[00:26:00]  Well, I heard that the defense is actually going to show my picture and say that she  fucked me.  She's an angel of mercy.  Yeah, that might do her some good.  Look at that.  She's taking care of little cancer kids.  The story's really funny.  It says her high heels clicking across the courtroom linoleum.  Yeah, it says she was not dressed for Rikers. 
[00:26:30]  She had a little flirty skirt on, an off-the-shoulder sweater, and five-inch pumps being led off to  Rikers.  Stiletto heels.  Where she will soon be also wearing a broom handle.  But she was in front of the show for a while there, and that's too bad.  Remember, they were flying her off to the West Coast.  Some guy, some rich Wall Street guy, she had a beat down at the airport.  He's going to get into his Learjet and just fly off with this guy and fuck him over the 
[00:27:00]  course of a weekend.  Yeah, they have good lives, those chicks, man.  I mean, if you're making that kind of money and you're getting flown all over, you're living  a pretty good life.  I think, though, when, what's his face?  Who was the guy that ran the joint?  Jason.  Yeah, I think when Jason went off, her world came apart, and she wasn't pulling in that  kind of cake anymore, and she figured she'd talk about it.  How do you get to that level as a hooker?  Like a national, like, headliner.  Yeah.  A hooker show headliner.  Making four grand a gig. 
[00:27:30]  She's like, right now, she's like the Dane cook of hookers.  The rest of them are making all kinds of money.  Yeah, the rest of them are doing food spots in the corner, blowing somebody for a falafel.  To get ready to jerk a guy off, a bigger hooker comes in and bumps him and blows him in front  of him.  That's terrible.  Billy's right, dude.  Billy's right.  They have a hierarchy like we do, man.  It's the same.  It's by your credit. 
[00:28:00]  It really is.  It's almost like she's got the fame and she's got the notoriety and she charges more money.  You may have seen her sucking cock at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.  Well, she's got an upcoming gangbang coming out on HBO.  Yeah, she's in the joint now.  $50,000 bail.  Isn't that 5G's cash?  Dude, that's 25 blowjobs.  You can't get started, Jimmy. 
[00:28:30]  Someone can't scrape up 5G's for this chick?  Get her out on bail?  I guess she's going to call.  Who's she going to call?  I think her money dried up a long time ago.  Yeah, she seemed like the type that was spending it.  Because they got...  I doubt...  Oh, go ahead, Jim.  No, no, I can't.  It's just like you're here, Jim.  It's just like you're here.  I know.  I keep...  I don't know.  Did anybody hear Colin Quinn and Nick's show at all when they were on Jamf Day?  No, we need tape of that.  It was actually funny.  I heard a break where Patrice called in and was talking. 
[00:29:00]  And the three of them were funny together.  But just to listen to nervous, idiot Colin try to be a radio host and talk.  Like, he must have said, okay, but I was going to...  Okay, but I was going to...  About six times.  It's like you fucking idiot.  Will you just wait a second and let everybody finish and then you can talk?  Oh, we should get tape of that.  Yeah.  They say it.  No, they think it's easy.  He thinks it's easy.  He's a fool.  Colin's a fool.  A lot of people think this radio thing is easy.  They just come in and talk, right?  Yeah.  No problem.  Is it getting lighter yet, Jimmy?  Is what getting lighter? 
[00:29:30]  Where you are.  Oh, um...  No, why?  Is that a hint?  It's still pitch black.  Yeah, it's still dark and creepy.  Are you hearing any creaks or sounds or anything?  No, it's actually a pretty newly renovated building.  Yeah.  And the studios, I hate studios.  Especially the rug in your apartment.  Yeah.  Well, no, only one section is brand new.  It's really creepy, dude. 
[00:30:00]  That's the first thing I thought of was these flies are collected in an area where some fucking  shit was...  And you know what the lady told me, this fucking liar?  She told me, oh, they cooked a lot of Greek food in here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's what did it.  That'll do it.  Yeah.  I guarantee Jimmy's out of that place within a week.  It's a gyro.  What do you cook the Greek food against the patio door on the fucking lower half of it?  This is fucking just really creepy.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, the woman who fucked me out of the money for the other apartment, she gave  me a refund of $200 and something dollars.  So I'm out to $1,600 from this lady. 
[00:30:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  $1,600 and she gives you a refund of $250?  It was $1,800 and then she gave me $250 or something back.  And what was this bitch's...  What was her explanation for not giving you a full refund for that shithole?  Well, she has to.  The lawyer talked to her and said something.  Well, she charged me for administrative fees.  What?  And for stopping payment.  Believe me, dude.  If we don't work this out, I've never requested any pest help, of course, for something personal. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  And look, I had to deal with some pests in that apartment.  Right.  I certainly think that she should understand that that's a very uncomfortable thing to have  to live with.  Call the troops out, right?  Dude, I've never...  Do you understand how much money she's stealing $1,600 from me?  Of course she is.  That's probably what she does.  She gets money like this.  People go in there.  They can't fucking live there.  She gives them back a little bit of money and pockets the rest.  Well, her argument was, well, I held the apartment for them.  Well, the fucking...  You're holding a roach-ridden apartment.  Yeah.  What's that mean? 
[00:31:30]  That's not a good product.  No.  That's why you're holding it.  Exactly.  There's no one in it because it's fucking bugs.  The bugs were there.  That is disgusting.  Dude, I can't live.  How are your mice, by the way?  I haven't found a mouse in a long time now.  You roaches or no?  I haven't seen a roach in a long time as well, so I'm all good.  I'm starting to look around now.  I'm going to buy finally.  You have to, dude.  I know.  Finally.  Because, you know, XM gave us a...  You know, they're real happy with us and we're going to be around in a while. 
[00:32:00]  So now we can set some roots down.  That's right.  Hey, did you hear about the DirecTV deal yesterday?  I was just about to congratulate.  Yeah.  I actually heard about that from Yoshi.  Did they announce five or no?  Yeah.  Five million was announced, I think, Monday.  Something like that.  And yesterday, the DirecTV deal.  And, man, the company's definitely coming to the table finally and showing that they believe in us.  Because they added us to this deal.  They didn't have to.  That's great.  And, you know, we're going to be... 
[00:32:30]  We're going to be...  What are you doing, Ben?  He's laying out the papers.  Oh, okay.  All the other papers I just got here.  We're going to be exposed to close to 15 million more people.  Dude, that's fucking...  Obviously, we're not going to get all 15 million.  But, you know, if we get even a small percent, we'll probably double the size of our audience easily.  So...  Well, congratulations, XM, for five million.  And I got a thanks to Logan very much.  I have to call to thank him.  But, you know, he took very good care of me recently. 
[00:33:00]  So, uh...  Ah.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy's getting a little raise.  Yes, they gave your pal a raise.  Oh, I heard about that.  Nice.  Yeah, I'm really happy.  So, I got to thank Logan.  I didn't get a chance to call him yet.  But, you know, it's just great news, man.  I'm glad the company's doing well.  What other job can you leave for weeks on end and get a raise?  I know.  What other job can you possibly do that?  I want that deal.  What does that show you about how badly I'm doing the job that I'm gone?  And he's like, all right, no, just stay out there.  Here's a little more money. 
[00:33:30]  You just stay away, and here's more money.  Hey, Jimmy, your pal's aunt and myself, we're negotiating with some networks ourselves.  Oh, yeah.  You know, you're not the only one that might be on television, my friend.  That's right.  We got some TV projects.  Movers and shakers working for us.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  You got to hook up your MiFi because you're missing some great radio, bro.  Yeah.  We spent at least two to three hours on this.  We did a TV pitch with A&E with this really bad production company that pretty much pitched Mythbusters to A&E starring Opie and Anthony. 
[00:34:00]  Dude, it was such a flop in the pitch.  We're sitting there as the guy that's pitching it is just eating his balls, and we're sitting there, and they're just straight-faced, the A&E people.  Just straight-faced.  And then they just, like, started picking apart everything the guy had just brought up for the pitch. 
[00:34:30]  It was embarrassing.  Were you guys embarrassed?  Oh, God, were we?  Just sitting there wanting to leave.  We couldn't.  The woman that's in charge over there at A&E, she had this bracelet watch, and, like, two minutes in, it was like a chandelier on her wrist.  And I just heard, clang, clang, clang, clang, as she looked at her watch.  And I was like, oh, this is going nowhere fast. 
[00:35:00]  And we explained it on the air, like, when we were off the air and we had no career, you know, I was brought right back to that moment thinking, this is all we have and we need this.  And then I realized, wait, no, we don't need this.  This would be just a little side thing.  So then we actually sat back in that conference room and enjoyed the disaster that was taking place in front of us.  The guy pitched the show as Mythbusters meets Jackass.  Jackass meets Jackass.  And the woman instantly went, well, we don't want to hear Jackass because the lawsuits that are happening with Jackass. 
[00:35:30]  And we have two shows in the can we can't even put out because of lawsuits with that Jackass type thing.  And then the guy kept bringing up Jackass.  And the woman's telling him.  But Jackass was, he's like, but Jackass was so huge and they made a movie because it was huge and blah, blah, blah.  And she's like, well, let's just not, you know, enough about the moose.  You know, no more Jackass.  And he just kept going.  And we're sitting there just at that huge, lonely conference table just eating it. 
[00:36:00]  Was he smooth or no?  Oh, God.  No.  It was embarrassing.  They might replay some of that over the weekend when they replay some of our shows.  It was a nightmare.  It was the exact opposite of how you want a pitch meeting to go.  That's fucking hilarious.  Dude, I mean, we did about two or three hours on it because it was just unbelievable.  He wouldn't take no for an answer.  It was so obvious they were done with us.  And then we're in the elevator.  And he's like, guys, I think we're really close.  We just got to tweak this a little bit.  I'm like, it was not a chance in hell. 
[00:36:30]  And he's like, I think we just got to tweak this a little and get back to them.  They gave us a one-way limo ride just there.  Opie gets in, shuts the door.  The handle comes off in his hand.  It was just a nightmare.  Yeah, because the production house, this TV production house, whatever, they needed us more than we need them.  So they were trying to show us, you know, that we're stars or whatever.  So, yeah, they get a limo to drive us over to A&E.  That was just awful.  We met them at their offices.  It was set up like a boiler room, like one of those where there's a bunch of illegal aliens on telephones until the cops come and chase them out soliciting illegal goods. 
[00:37:00]  We can't find one thing these guys have done that anyone knows of.  He was crowing about some equestrian reality show that the Travel Channel was picking up.  Unless they're showing over and over again Christopher Reeve breaking his neck.  I don't want to see it. 
[00:37:30]  It was the worst pitch meeting.  We walked 38 blocks after we left this.  Me and Opie just laughing our asses of like two lunatics in Manhattan laughing at how badly this went.  This guy pitched the show as Mythbusters with lawsuits.  Yeah.  Brilliant.  So what you're saying is this is Mythbusters with some kind of court action later.  Some type of financial burden through litigation later.  Tell them about, he's like, what would they just be doing? 
[00:38:00]  He's just like, hey, you guys are just doing it.  Oh, that's it too, because then they're asking questions.  It's like, okay, well, I guess the gist was we're going to do things that everyone wants to see ever since they're a kid.  Jimmy, you ever want to see a grand piano drop through the roof of a house?  That's the kind of stuff ONA will be doing.  And then the woman's like, all right, well, you got the stunt type thing.  We understand that.  But what's happening?  What's the setup?  How does it end?  And he just kind of didn't have an answer.  It was just kind of like, well, ONA, just do what they do. 
[00:38:30]  And then she turns and she starts looking at us for an answer on how this ends.  And I'm sitting there.  I felt like I was in school and just picked on and didn't know the answer.  I think it actually came out of my mouth.  I think I said, don't pick me.  Don't pick.  I don't have the I don't know.  I can't even make something up.  He actually told them that by the end of the show, we don't accomplish anything.  No.  That's the beauty.  We just don't figure out anything. 
[00:39:00]  At which point it felt like the Seinfeld pitch episode where George just kept going to show about nothing.  And they were bombing in the meeting.  We were bombing.  Well, was she looking at you, though, like when he said, look, Opie and Anthony will just do what they do.  Did she look at you to go, all right, what is it that you guys do?  Yes.  Yes.  And then we're trying to say, well, you know, on the radio, we have a very, you know, it's like guys just kind of hanging out and talking to each other like we would at a bar or any other setting that, you know, 
[00:39:30]  and how does that translate into driving a car into a big pool of Jell-O?  Oh, but let me, Opie, how would that?  And at that point I just openly started laughing.  You know how I do?  Because I don't have anything else and I'm uncomfortable and a little nervous.  So I just started laughing really loud in her face.  Dude, it was so embarrassing.  Such bomb.  I was getting like hot flashes.  The guy is turning beet red. 
[00:40:00]  Like I had, you know, you know how they hand out bottles of water at the conference tables whenever you do those meetings?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I finished mine.  And no one ever finishes the water.  I was so hot and like my mouth was getting all dry and I, it was such an uncomfortable place to be a minute in.  And, Jimmy, you know when we knew we were done is when the head muckety-muck there that makes all the decisions changed the conversation  and she actually said, so is it still nice outside? 
[00:40:30]  Still nice outside?  Ah.  Never a good sign of the pitch.  Yeah.  Well, you know, Jerry Seinfeld must have gotten the same question after the pitch meeting.  Yeah.  For that show.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  I think that's even worse than bombing on a comedy stage because bombing in comedy is just, you know, a bunch of fucking idiots.  You'll never see them again.  Right, right.  That actually might have made your life better.  Right.  It could have made that one instance may have made our life better and now no.  No.  And we might have to deal with them again. 
[00:41:00]  We could walk in now to a pitch meeting with Jesus and Satan with us and pitch a show of these two fighting live on television.  And they will go, weren't they the guys that were in here with that idiot about the Mythbusters jackass show?  No, I'm sorry.  Christ's sake, we're going to have to pass.  Were you embarrassed for him?  Oh, yeah.  Embarrassed for everyone in the room.  I saw my reflection in the window and I was embarrassed for that guy.  I swear to God.  This guy is delusional, man. 
[00:41:30]  Absolutely delusional.  Yeah.  And then she's talking about the weather.  I'm like, oh, God, just get us out of here.  It was a horror.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm going to go outside and check.  Hang on a second.  Yeah, let me go and then run.  Yeah.  Run from those scenes.  I'm sure that's how other pitch meetings go where they're walking to the elevator talking about the weather.  The weather.  Instead of saying stuff like, don't pitch this to anyone else.  We'll get together later today.  Yeah, let's talk tonight.  Tonight.  I'm going to email you there.  Yeah.  Hey, still warm out?  I'm like, yeah.  For this late in the season, it's pretty warm still. 
[00:42:00]  Obviously, it's warm.  I'm sweating.  I'm in an air-conditioned building and I'm sweating.  That really is humiliating.  Oh, Jimmy.  You're walking and pretending that didn't just happen.  Right.  You're talking with the guy who raped you and just chatting with him.  But then we're thinking, we're all the way up.  Your ass still hurts and he's asking you about the weather.  He's telling you to put your coat on.  There you go, sweetie.  All right, take it easy.  I think the relationship went well. 
[00:42:30]  I think it just needs some tweaking.  Every brutalized dude who's asking you how the food is in that restaurant down the street.  You're like, yeah, it's good.  Oh, jeez.  That's like one of those bad date rape school movies where the girl starts crying afterwards  and the guy has no clue.  Like, what's wrong?  Yeah, what?  What?  Why are you crying?  I'm showing you how much I care about you.  Well, there's nothing better than a passive-aggressive date rape in a movie.  And then, you know, the meeting was summed up when we hit the sidewalk. 
[00:43:00]  We all went our own ways.  And we're 35 blocks from where we need to be.  And that's the point we realize.  It's rush hour traffic and the limo's gone.  Yeah, the limo.  No limo for the ride back.  He only hired it for one way.  Jesus.  Great.  Very, very great.  I wish I had been there for that.  Oh, I know.  It's great.  Just when you think things are going well in your career, you know, you get these reminders.  Get that little reminder of your place on the ladder.  That's right.  I've got to go to bed, boys, because it's quarter to five already.  Dude, they're telling us that you've got to go. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, they're saying they've got to let me be.  Jimmy, a heads up.  I don't know if it works for radio.  I'm going to try it here.  But I think Steve sent it to you, or it's on foundrymusic.com or opianathony.com.  Someone out there, this thing is just going everywhere.  Someone took the Shining trailer and added different music to the trailer.  Same.  Yeah, they use actual audio from the movie.  They cut it.  They cut the video up and added music to it to make it seem like it's a completely different  type of movie.  Oh, really? 
[00:44:00]  Like a romantic comedy almost.  Yeah, like a romantic comedy.  You've got to see the video.  It's really, really good.  I think it's on opianathony.com right now.  I'll check it out soon.  I'll wake up.  All right, buddy.  Check in soon, all right?  I'll talk to you guys earlier in the week, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.  I really miss you guys, man.  We miss you, Jimmy.  We'll see you soon.  I miss you guys.  All right, Billy.  Take care.  All right, Jim.  Bye, boy.  There he goes, Jimmy Norton.  It's our little pal.  You want to try this Shining thing?  I don't know.  I don't know how it works with just the audio.  Trust me, the video's really, really good. 
[00:44:30]  This thing's going to be all over the world.  It is already.  I'm noticing it's getting emailed to me like five times a day I'm getting this thing.  Very funny.  All right, let's try it here.  Meet Jack Torrance.  I'm outlining a new writing project.  He's a writer looking for inspiration.  Lots of ideas.  Little good ones.  Meet Danny.  Hi, Mr. Torrance.  He's a kid looking for a dad.  There's hardly anybody to play with around here.  Dad. 
[00:45:00]  What's up, Doc?  Jack just can't finish his book.  I don't want to sound melodramatic, but there's no way to make it economically feasible.  Here's to five miserable months.  But now, sometimes, what we need the most is just around the corner.  I'm your new foster father. 
[00:45:30]  I'd do anything.  Climbing up on Salisbury Hill.  I love it.  I could see the city light.  My heart going boom, boom, boom, boom.  Sun, he said.  Grab your things.  I've come to take you home.  Shining.  There you have it.  Shining.  Obviously, the video brings the whole thing together, but you get the idea. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, music's playing.  They're all frolicking.  Like, every scene is them frolicking.  Even if they're running away from a murderer, it looks like they're running, like, with that  music playing.  It really did a good job, whoever edited that together.  That's up there, Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a link right on the front of Opie and Anthony.  Just another nameless guy that just put something on the web, and, you know, everyone's going  to take credit for it.  Dude, that was me.  I'm not so sure that was a nameless guy.  That was, uh, it could have been, but I got...  What's his name? 
[00:46:30]  What?  What's his name?  I don't know what his name is, but I got a...  So he's a nameless guy.  Uh, well, at the moment he's a nameless guy, but, uh, I got that sent to me a hundred  times yesterday alone, only because, you know, when it's so obvious when stuff like  that hits the web, because the links come in like crazy.  Yeah.  So it must have just happened, and Yoshi called me at maybe nine o'clock last night and said  a friend of his, a friend of his is the one that actually did it.  Yeah, sure it is.  I don't know.  Sure it is.  I don't know.  So he's a friend.  These are the new urban legends.  They, the things that pop up on the web.  Someone obviously had to sit there and cut it up and had the idea and everything, but you never 
[00:47:00]  know who they are.  Their, their genius just goes unnoticed.  It's true.  Well, I wish.  All right.  Good one.  We're going to step aside and we'll continue.  We got to talk about, uh, the Red Sox and the Yankees a little bit.  It's going to be unbelievable.  Also, you know what?  Unbelievable.  Bill Burr got rave reviews yesterday when he went at it with Scott Farrell.  Oh, that was great.  We cut it up in case you missed it yesterday.  It's about two and a half minutes long.  It's really good.  A hardcore Yankee fan and a hardcore Red Sox fan just going at it. 
[00:47:30]  It's topical.  Talking baseball.  Right.  Yeah, right.  Like, it didn't get personal.  Boston, New York fans always talk.  We should get Scott Farrell on the, on the phone today because it's going to be a huge  weekend.  It's a, just such a big news story.  Uh, you turn on the news here in New York and I'm sure up in Boston and that's like  lead story.  Yeah.  The whole thing.  John Montone from 1010 wins, uh, it went up to Boston.  He was here talking to New Yorkers and just, again, just like Bill said, they just get  the dolts.  Yeah.  The dopes. 
[00:48:00]  He probably got 50 intelligent comments on the upcoming games and, uh, they just pick  the curse is back.  The curse is back.  It's not even a one-year curse.  They're the defending champions, you fucking moron.  I can't wait to chant 2004 at you.  Then what are you going to do?  Huh?  It's the curse of nine months ago.  That's how it works, because I'm a fucking moron. 
[00:48:30]  And you'd still have to, even if they beat us,  you've still got to win the World Series,  because if you don't, you haven't won it since 2000.  Right.  Just relax.  Both of us, our pitching staffs are beat up.  I have no idea.  It's just going to be...  I'm going to have to watch it with the sound turned down,  because for a second I hear Chris Berman like,  oh, the Yankees scored a run in the top of the first.  You'd just lose your mind.  Yeah, him and Dan Sean.  You got your MiFi. 
[00:49:00]  Huh?  You got your MiFi.  Listen to the game on your MiFi.  Or maybe, you know, watch it.  I can't.  I have to watch these local guys and just hate them.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Part of the love.  Page two of the paper, the New York paper here, the Daily News.  Curses.  Ghost of Bambino is back.  Oh, my God, already.  And the first line is,  it's official, the curse is back.  Well, it's official.  Obviously.  This guy, Dave Goldener, a Daily News staff writer, he's making it official. 
[00:49:30]  It's official.  How is it official that the curse is back?  The curse is back.  They're still the defending World Series champions.  How is that?  They're just hanging their heads.  Did they wake up and all their rings were gone?  And it was like, wait, what happened?  Yeah.  It disappeared.  It's off the record books.  They never won.  You have to go.  They didn't start talking curse until at least 60 years in.  So we're good until about 2064.  Oh, yeah.  You can't bring it up now. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, this is what you were talking about in The Office, Dan Shaughnessy, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's a writer for the Boston Globe.  He's the guy who actually coined the phrase, the curse of the babe.  And he's the only guy in Boston who was pissed, I bet, when the Red Sox won it because he  has made an absolute fortune off of that fucking fairy tale rather than just going, hey,  we sucked as a franchise for 86 years or whatever.  They're like, oh, it was a goblin.  It's in his best interest to keep this going.  Let me read a little bit of this. 
[00:50:30]  It's official.  The curse is back.  The chronicler of the Red Sox near century of futility now admits that the star-crossed  team has slipped back into choke mode after its unlikely World Series win last year.  And I quote, these are, after all, the Red Sox, wrote Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy,  author, excuse me, of Curse of the Bambino.  He added the Sox have been put on this earth to make us suffer.  I mean, what do you have to do?  They had the greatest comeback in professional sports history about a year ago. 
[00:51:00]  You know what I mean?  They're one game out of first, and this guy's writing it like he just went through another  70 years of misery.  Right.  I'm surprised no one in Boston's beat him up, really, because Red Sox fans absolutely  hate Dan Shaughnessy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I'm really surprised because he's at all the games.  You can't miss him.  He's got that goofy hair.  He's a funny-looking guy.  No, he's just trying to make money.  They're trying to sell papers, and he's stirring it up.  What a loser.  He continues.  She said, the Sox, 2005 September swoon, has brought back all the bad vibes the Beantown 
[00:51:30]  buffoons thought were gone for good.  I quote again here.  It's alliteration.  It has to be right, huh?  The Beantown buffoons.  Beantown buffoons.  The quote is, we thought we put all this stuff to bed last year.  No more 1948, 1949, 1974, 1978, 1986, or 2003.  No more talk of collapse, he wrote last weekend.  Now this.  Now this.  Can you believe that shit?  It's like, we grew up like what?  Like five games? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not a collapse.  They're a $200 million team.  We're a $150 million team.  It's like you just, they're going to battle it out.  And it's going to be a great weekend, and just watch it, enjoy it, and whoever wins is  the better team.  That's it.  All this fucking, the misery.  We thought we put it to bed.  We did put it to bed, and you wrote that article last year, you fucking idiot.  I still have it.  I got it framed on my wall.  I like how the curse is back, and it's official. 
[00:52:30]  That's official.  Yeah, that guy said it.  Like, how is it made official?  It's official.  We need to sell papers.  Unbelievable.  He continues.  Go to the fridge and look at that photograph of you standing next to the World Series trophy,  Shaughnessy 52 wrote on September 10th.  Remind yourself, it's different now.  Huh?  Why?  Why is it different?  I bet he married the first girl he ever fucked.  You know what I mean?  You think?  Because he just figured, you know, it'll never happen again with that negative mindset. 
[00:53:00]  The curse of my penis.  I better get this girl and just scoop her up.  I went 24 years without getting anything.  Better fucking cling on.  Yeah.  That's just, you know, in this day and age, it's hard for any sports franchise to repeat,  you know?  I know it still happens, but...  Yeah, the Patriots have done it.  Let's see.  No.  That's why I say I know it still happens, but...  Jesus, I'm in this fucking pats.  I know.  You can't believe this shit.  As far as a sports fan, it's like, no matter, even if the Yankees sweep us, whatever, I 
[00:53:30]  can't be in a bad mood.  It's like, we've won three out of the last four Super Bowls in a World Series title.  It's like, you know, we've...  That doesn't get taken away when you don't win the next year.  Yeah, like, we're going to be all miserable.  Yeah.  We won't be, but they'll find ten douchebags to get sound bites and be like, you know,  those people like, you know, I hold a pen like this in my right hand any time they  play, and if I set it down, then they lose, and then they play like this on Golden 
[00:54:00]  Pond music underneath it, and they make everybody look like retards.  Right.  Because that's what sells.  That's what people want to hear.  People don't want to hear, you know, well, we won last year, and we hope they give it  their best shot, and then we come out on top.  Whenever they show Yankee fans, they never show somebody with, like, their shit together.  They always show that guy with, like, his shaved head, like he's got, like, fucking  12 beards, and, look at Yankee!  Big fucking gut hanging out like John Goodman.  You know what I mean?  The curse, baby!  Back! 
[00:54:30]  You know who's one of those superstitious idiots is Earl.  Earl's refusing to shave until the Yankees get knocked out.  Yeah, he's not going to shave now, until, like, he's on the team.  Like, he's in the locker room, and they're going to ask him, hey, you're not shaving?  Well, you know how it goes every year.  Well, he's the guy we congratulate when the Yankees win, though.  Yeah.  Earl, congratulations.  Like, he had something to do with it.  Yeah, he had something to do with it.  He gets a ring or something.  Yeah, exactly.  I think it's, I think if you're going to be a sports writer in this day and age, though,  you've got to be as negative as possible about the thing you're writing about.  I mean, the papers, the New York papers are filled with these asses.  Yeah, New York papers are brutal, too.  All these sports writers absolutely hate sports, so why are you even writing about sports anymore? 
[00:55:00]  Because they're the nerds from gym class who never got picked.  And all these guys who play, they're the ones who were, like, during dodgeball.  Right.  Who're fucking breaking their glasses as they beamed them in the face.  They fuck.  Their nose is numb until, like, last period.  They just find something negative about every single thing.  I gave up reading the New York sports writers, because it's the same shit.  That asshole Phil Mushnick.  Phil Mushnick is a perfect example.  The guy hates sports. 
[00:55:30]  Why are you writing about sports at this point?  Wow.  Obviously, the game has passed you by.  You don't like it the way you did, so go write about it.  He's got the perfect last name.  He just sounds like he whines.  Mushnick.  Go write children's book.  It's just a mush.  He's a real ass, this guy.  Boy, they really do not paint a promising picture for the Sox in this article, does he?  No, that's his thing.  Worst bullpen in the American League.  He's probably in danger.  No legitimate closer.  He's probably in danger of losing his house. 
[00:56:00]  All the money he was making off that curse of the Bambino.  Johnny Damon is beat to a pulp and soon will be imitating Will Chamberlain's free throws  when he tosses from center field.  This is a guy that writes for the Boston Globe.  Right.  It sounds like it came out of the post.  Johnny Damon, the guy who hit the Grand Slam to put the Yankees to bed in Game 7 of last  year, and he's already trashing them.  He's beat to a pulp.  I mean, New York papers do the same thing.  I see them, you know.  And what happened, I mean, I think when your team does win a championship, it should last 
[00:56:30]  more than a year, you know.  Most people, as soon as the next year comes and they don't repeat, they get all depressed  again, you know.  I think you should enjoy the fact that you won a championship in recent years.  But the whole, I don't know, the whole sports thing has completely changed.  You can enjoy it for a year until, you know, someone else is crowned World Series champions  and then that's it.  Then your team sucks again.  Yeah.  The misery of a Red Sox fan.  Try being an Expos fan. 
[00:57:00]  Like a Padres fan.  Are there any?  Yeah.  They've never met one.  Didn't you have to go to, like, Puerto Rico or something to watch the Expos this year?  Yeah, the last year.  Now they're down now.  The Nationals.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  They left.  They just won.  They're never, ever winning it again.  There are just some teams you just never hear fans from.  The Brewers.  You could be in any city.  You will see the friggin' Boston hat on somebody.  Any city in the country.  Yeah, I don't see any.  You'll see a Yankee hat.  I don't see any Brewers hats here in New York City. 
[00:57:30]  You really don't see many Brewers hats.  You make a good point.  Padres.  Yeah.  Well, the brothers wear the Padres hats.  I don't know what that's about, but something's going on in the community.  The homeboys wear the Padres hats?  Yeah, all of a sudden they get behind some obscure team, but I think that has...  No, it's more colors.  Yeah, it's about the colors than the team.  Yeah, Patrice does a bit about that.  Oh, really?  So when white people come up and ask him, you know, do you like the whatever?  He's like, no, I just like the colors.  The colors go with what he's wearing.  San Diego actually clinched.  They're in the playoffs this year, the Padres. 
[00:58:00]  And who cares?  I know, exactly.  Hello?  Hello?  Exactly.  What was that?  He didn't bash Ortiz, though.  If he bashed Ortiz, he's suicidal.  Ortiz just really, I'm sorry.  As a Yankee fan, you got to hit him in the head so hard with a ball that he's just out  for good for postseason.  Oh, that's your old guy?  Yeah.  Ortiz, he's just a monster.  For me, it's whenever I see Derek Jeter. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  The fucking guy.  When I remember game seven, he was the only guy.  Like, he just was still, I was like, I was nervous when he was on first.  He started pumping his fist.  Like, this fucking, he has like this, almost like willing them.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He just didn't have the right guys.  That guy is, you know, even though the Red Sox fan, that guy's, I can say that, man.  He's fucking unbelievable.  Yeah, he's one of those, like, Yankee legends.  Oh, he's the first guy up on it.  In the future, it's going to be one of those guys that just is in the same class as DiMaggio. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, he's the first guy up on the dugout steps, getting people high-fived.  Yeah.  When some guy from, like, the minor leagues gets brought up and hits a home run, he's unbelievable.  That's what it is.  Like, when the old guys talk about DiMaggio and Lou Gehrig, and I remember when I watched  him play, you know, that's going to be, he's going to be one of those guys.  Oh, yeah.  When you talk about him playing, yeah.  He'll have a big weekend.  Hopefully we can.  All right, someone is defending the Brewers on the phones here.  All right.  A Brewers fan?  I've got to respect this right off the bat.  Timmy from Wisconsin.  What's going on, guys? 
[00:59:30]  Hey, Timmy.  If the Brewers play the Pirates today, tomorrow, and Sunday, if we win one of those games,  we're guaranteed 500 for this year, for the first time since 92.  Really?  It'll be a 500 team?  Yep.  That's what I love about doing a national talk show.  See, Toss, it's all about the Yankees and the Red Sox.  But in your little neck of the country, there's a whole different thing you're hoping for.  They're all psyched to play 500 ball.  There's probably articles all over the Milwaukee papers talking about how they might be 500. 
[01:00:00]  That's what we talked down to them.  You're a little neck of the woods.  You're a cute little state out there, huh?  Wisconsin's a state.  Yes, it is.  Hey, guys.  Oh, that's horrible.  You just know your own backyard.  That's all.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, Timmy.  Milwaukee Brewers in 2009.  All right.  There you go.  2009.  There you go.  He's giving himself the time to build a team up and everything.  That's nice.  Let's say hi to Max Cleveland.  Checking in.  What's up, Max?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing? 
[01:00:30]  Pretty good.  Hey, I just wanted to say, Bill, I feel your pain from all these years living in Cleveland,  man.  We've been struggling forever, and if the Tribe makes it this year and doesn't win the World  Series, they're just going to give a shit again about how, oh, they can never do it.  They haven't won since 54.  No, sir.  I'm not in that boat.  We won it last year.  There's no pain for you to feel.  People just forgot about it.  It's already starting.  You know.  You know, Bill, right?  The pain.  You still remember.  Every year, right?  No.  Not last year. 
[01:01:00]  No.  I hit the lottery.  I'm sitting in the big house.  I'm done.  I'm tired.  We're hoping for that same ticket, man.  We're hoping to hit that lottery.  Dude, I hope you guys win it.  I hope you win it.  I don't give a shit.  You know, I got mine.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Gooch89.  Gooch89, what's up?  Gooch89.  I don't know.  That's what they're...  Oh.  I'm from Cleveland, too, and I just wanted to...  Well, what's your name, bro?  What's your name?  It's Gooch.  It's just The Gooch, man.  Oh, The Gooch.  The Gooch.  We know you.  I thought there was some other guy with a Gooch type of name.  There's only one Gooch, fellas.  All right, The Gooch. 
[01:01:30]  What's up?  I'm just also from Cleveland, and I want...  Billy, before, was saying that, you know, you can't really bitch because the Patriots  won three fucking Super Bowls.  Try living in Cleveland where we get fucked over any time we have a good team.  That's all I wanted to say.  That guy kind of stole my thunder before me.  You got a great football coach this year.  Romeo?  Yeah, from the Patriots.  He's doing...  Oh, from the Patriots.  Ben, just always brings it back to the Pats.  Ben, you are what everybody hates about Boston fans.  Yeah.  You are that guy.  I'm that guy.  I'm a real fan.  Okay, you're a real fan, but it was... 
[01:02:00]  Oh, the Sox, they got a win.  They haven't won so many four fucking Super Bowls.  You had the greatest basketball player ever.  Didn't the Bruins win a championship?  Yeah, you're all correct, sir.  Thank you.  Okay, well, that's the thing.  Here, we haven't had a championship since 1968.  Yeah, but we're not competing against you.  We're competing against, like, New York.  I understand.  The bar's a lot higher, sir.  Step up your game.  The massive suffering that Boston fans go through.  Shut up.  Get some money.  Buy some players.  And why is your stadium right on that fucking lake?  Because we like it cold. 
[01:02:30]  Holy crap.  We like it cold and nasty.  That's a brilliant place to have a sports stadium, right on the lake.  It starts freezing in October.  Yeah.  I was at a Monday nighter in December at that thing.  Why?  Because it's fun.  It's not fun after a while.  It's fun to get drunk, be cold, yell, throw shit.  It's a blast.  Yeah, but you know something, out in Cleveland, you guys never had to deal with fucking all  these idiots on ESPN every night just trying to find miserable people in your town and  doing these little fairy tales about them.  But you can tell them to all fuck off because you won. 
[01:03:00]  We can't do that.  We still suck.  We have no championship.  You guys remember the drive, the Elway?  You guys, anybody remember that 86 AFC championship game?  No.  I actually remember it.  I'm just being a dick on purpose.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  That was brutal.  What about Jordan's shot against the Cavaliers?  Yeah, but he was killing everybody.  That's right.  You guys had a good basketball team there for a while.  We had Doherty, Nance, Ron Harper, Mark Price, Craig Ewell.  Always someone a little better, right?  They were fucking great, and Jordan just murdered us. 
[01:03:30]  It's all about LeBron now.  Oh, yeah.  LeBron James.  The guy that works for me is a security guard in a building where LeBron lives and saw  him wipe a booger on the elevator.  I would have to get rid of that elevator.  He picked his nose and wiped the booger right on the buttons where everybody touches.  The real story is he refused him an autograph.  He's going to bring you guys a championship.  LeBron's a dick.  What an ass wiping boogers on the buttons.  Hey, I'm going to sound really stupid. 
[01:04:00]  Cavaliers ever win an NBA championship?  I have no idea.  No, they never have.  All right.  LeBron could give you your first one.  Of course.  Well, they made a ton of off-season moves.  I don't know how big a basketball fan you are, but they brought in Larry Hughes.  Tons of guys this year.  They should be good.  Yeah, Larry Hughes will definitely help you.  Plus, we've got a new owner.  Dan Gilbert.  He owns Quicken Loans.  The guy's got a billion fucking dollars.  All right.  Well, good luck to you guys.  All right, Coach.  Thank you.  Later.  Let's say hi to Mark.  Cavaliers will never win anything until they change the name and their logo. 
[01:04:30]  Cavaliers.  What's up, Mark?  What's up, man?  I just want to say, fuck you to all you guys.  Try being a Buffalo fan.  Yeah, that's a tough nut.  I did that for a while when I was living up there.  Four Super Bowls.  No Stanley Cup.  One, two Stanley Cup appearances.  Nothing.  And so close to one of those Super Bowls.  Oh, so close.  I'm saying I'm from Boston.  I'm not miserable.  Right.  You're not miserable.  I just can't beat the fucking tide.  I'm shoveling shit against the tide. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  Because everyone is still going to call, Bill, I know exactly how you feel.  I understand your pain.  Three Super Bowls in a World Series.  By the way, Burr would know this.  I'm at a NACA conference right now.  You're what?  At a NACA conference.  Oh, that's the college thing.  Oh, really?  Those things are the worst.  What do you got to do?  You perform for college kids at like nine in the morning.  Oh, that's...  Doing your stand-up act.  That's a great gig.  You have a halfway decent set.  You think you're going to get a bunch of colleges, and then somebody comes out and juggles. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, no.  And fucking brings people on stage to do a conga line, and they book like 50 schools, and you don't get anything.  Oh, my God.  What is it, like a wedding band thing?  Like a wedding?  They go in and audition.  This comedian band band.  It's auditioning for...  I remember one year I was hosting, and this guy ended his show.  I swear to God, he threw marshmallows out at the crowd.  No, he didn't.  And encouraged them to throw the marshmallows at him as he was hitting them with a bat. 
[01:06:00]  And then he had almost like an anti-aircraft gun kind of thing with marshmallows shooting out all over the fucking stage.  Standing ovation.  And I'm walking out there after him, like kicking the marshmallows out of the way, going,  and so I got a computer recently.  Anybody?  Oh, no.  That's awful.  Oh, God, is that horrid.  That's really funny.  And true, too.  And he gets the gigs.  Of course he did.  Bunch of shit flying around the room.  That's all people want. 
[01:06:30]  And a free T-shirt.  That's another big one.  You could run for president.  Is that your campaign slogan?  Anybody votes for me gets a free T-shirt.  I'm in.  No, I like this guy.  That's a bad idea.  This guy's solid.  Some dumb stats really fast.  Major League Baseball franchises with the longest postseason drought.  Not even making it to the postseason.  Milwaukee Brewers haven't been there since 1982.  Kansas City Royals since 1985.  Tigers since 87. 
[01:07:00]  Pirates since 92.  Philly since 93.  Not even postseason.  Not even postseason.  Phillies are another team, man.  I feel bad for those guys.  These guys have been around since like 1880.  They're averaging one World Series every 100 years.  Don't forget the...  I guess it's not like 125.  Phillies won in 1980.  Yeah, I know, but I'm saying they've been around since 1880.  Right.  And that's the only time?  That's the thing, though.  No one was chanting 19...  Oh, 18, whatever the fuck.  1880.  Yeah, no one was chanting that shit. 
[01:07:30]  There was no ESPN around to hype it.  Right.  Plus, you know, it all depends on like who your biggest rival is.  It's like our biggest rival is New York, and, you know, New York, Boston, Philly are just,  I think, the best shit talkers.  Uh-huh.  So, I mean, if you've got something like that going on against you, you're fucked.  Yeah.  What about Chicago?  We haven't mentioned Chicago.  Dude, they have two teams that combined haven't won it in like, what, 900 years?  I got the stats, and Billy's not far off.  They're doubling down every hand, and they keep losing. 
[01:08:00]  Just splitting aces every fucking season, and they just can't fucking get it done.  The guy at the table playing two spots on the table because the seats aren't all full.  I did a gig on Chicago.  I'm going to play this and this.  And they tried, when somebody yelled 1918 at me, and I just went off.  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  What are you, 1906 and what, 1907?  Double the chance.  Here it is.  The Chicago Cubs last won the World Series in 1908.  Longest drought.  What about the White Sox?  Right behind them, 1917. 
[01:08:30]  See that?  They have two teams going for it every year, and they still haven't won it in, do the math  really fast, 88 years.  And they get a free pass.  No one fucking talks about that.  That's who Shaughnessy should be talking about.  We just won a World Series, you know what I mean?  And it's like, he's bitching about us, and it's like, look at the White Sox.  They have better odds than most of the teams out there.  They've got two teams every year, and they haven't done shit.  Dude, watch old films of World War I. 
[01:09:00]  That's the time.  That's the time frame we're looking at.  Guys with those pointy German helmets running into nerve gas in trenches.  That's the time frame.  The Titanic.  How about you?  That's the time frame we're looking at.  Pop up the year 1917.  1917 was the last time a Chicago team won the World Series.  We'll give them the benefit of the doubt, because the Cubs go all the way back to 1908.  But we'll give them one.  So since 1917, they haven't had a World Series champion in Chicago. 
[01:09:30]  And then after that, as Anthony gets that, the Indians, Cleveland Indians, haven't won  the World Series since 1948.  Very good, Bill.  And then do you know who's next, offhand?  Or I'll give you the team.  San Francisco Giants.  Oh, that wasn't that in the 50s?  Very good, 1954.  God damn, you know your shit.  Them and the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the Yankees won every other time.  And then the stats get to the point where I turn off all the sports channels.  It's the who cares.  You know what I mean? 
[01:10:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The first couple are interesting for everybody, and then that's why sports radio will never  have huge audiences, because then they go, well, and then you got the Astros, they haven't  won since 1962, and then after that, it'll be the Brewers' 19...  Shut up.  Yeah, the Astros, that's just basically when they came into the league, because they've  never won it.  All right.  You got the...  Wow, I can't even find good history.  It was all about, like, the war and the Russian Revolution.  By the way, speaking of baseball, Hank Aaron is going to be on with Rob Dibble and Kevin 
[01:10:30]  Kennedy today at 3 o'clock on the East Coast on...  175.  Is it true that those teams watched communism come in and go out of Russia and hadn't won  the whole time?  Holy shit.  The whole time Russia was communist?  You know how much misery took place?  We did, too.  Yeah, you did, too.  But...  But...  Now...  I mean, when we were on year 86, they were on year 87.  You can't really trash them. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Poor Chicago.  Damn, that is a long time, though.  There's nothing you could give us from 1917, really?  It's very hard to find something.  Is that how they came up with that slogan?  Dan's got a couple of things.  Wow.  Germany announces unrestricted U-boat warfare.  With those new submarine things.  Oh, this is always the worst one.  British captures Baghdad?  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  That would happen.  They should have kept it, bastards.  We'd all been out of some trouble. 
[01:11:30]  Of course...  Peter Malinsky invents toaster.  Of course, 1917, USA enters World War I.  We know that from our stupid history classes, right?  Russian Revolution begins, like Ant said.  Tsar Nicholas II abdicates in Russia.  Yep.  They're even using words that we don't use anymore.  Bizarre.  Lenin arrives in Russia.  John?  He was playing there.  Yeah, it's all about communism and Russia. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, that was a big year for the revolution and World War I.  King Tut visits St. Louis.  British...  The Brits were very busy in the year 1970.  They were taking over everything.  Jerusalem captured by British.  And...  What were they doing back then?  And Russia opened separate peace negotiations with Germany.  What was the number one hit on the radio back in 1917?  Radio.  I want that stuff.  Deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet.  What was the...  What did the subway cost you back in 1917? 
[01:12:30]  Was there a subway in 1917?  Yeah.  It was like the 1800s.  But was it one of those round ones that used air pressure to push them down?  I was getting on that thing.  What did the paper cost you back in 1917?  It had to be a penny.  Everything was a penny back then.  What about a half gallon of milk?  Penny.  Penny?  Everything was a penny.  Everyone just carried around pennies.  Didn't even need dollars.  Those all stayed in the bank.  All right, well, those are boring facts.  Yeah, not much going on in 1917. 
[01:13:00]  Well, we were going to do this after the break, but we did it before the break,  so now we've got to play the Bill Burr-Scott Pharrell fight from yesterday.  It was a discussion.  It was a little discussion.  Because I'd never seen anybody throw it back at Pharrell where you couldn't hear Pharrell anymore,  and Pharrell was just getting lambasted.  Yeah, you killed him.  Renato.  Yes.  What's up?  Renato.  What do you got?  The Cubs have the Billy Goat Curse.  Yeah, the Billy Goat Curse is always second fiddle to the Curse of the Bambino.  Yeah.  And now that there's no Curse of the Bambino, the Billy Goat Curse hasn't really taken over that top spot. 
[01:13:30]  They said you can't bring a farm animal.  It's like a health code violation.  It's a filthy animal.  Get it out of here.  Yeah.  All right, punch out.  Yeah, what's that curse about again?  I don't know.  Some guy tried to bring a goat into the baseball stadium, and they said,  Hey, sir, you can't bring that goat in here.  And then he goes,  Well, then you guys are cursed.  That's that big.  Isn't that a great story?  Kind of like you were trapped in an elevator, and you needed to, like, kill some fucking time. 
[01:14:00]  I'm going to tell you the story of the Curse of the Goat.  The Curse of the Billy Goat.  That's really funny.  Oh, Jesus.  That is so not a curse.  Your team is pretty sad when the last time you won a World Series, you were allowed to bring animals to the stadium.  Yeah, but not goats.  Your monkey may come in, sir, but keep that goat outside.  Let's go to Jim in Illinois.  Jim, it's all about Chicago today. 
[01:14:30]  You guys stink.  I know it.  I know they do, but I'm going to wear my Cubs hat and my Cubs shirt no matter what.  You've got a lot of Cubbies fans wearing the gear.  Were you looking at Anthony's scrapbook earlier when you were talking about the war and stuff?  Yeah, my 1970s scrapbook.  Very nice.  Oh, you know what I wanted to ask him or any Chicago people who were listening?  You know that dude who reached out and grabbed the ball there?  Yeah.  He got so much shit.  I hate how they never brought up the fact that there were, like, six guys around him all lunging for the ball, too. 
[01:15:00]  They just didn't get it.  They just didn't get it.  Yeah.  That poor guy's life was over.  I mean, he got death threats.  Didn't he get, like, plastic surgery to change his appearance or something?  Did he?  I don't know about rumors of that, yeah.  Yeah, I think that's, like, the myth.  Yeah, well, myth buster.  Nobody's ever seen him.  This is your first episode.  That's part of the pitch, side of the bus.  Didn't get a no-job, huh?  Who gets, well, it's a whole show on people that get plastic surgery so baseball fans don't kill them.  At least we're still trying to figure out our pitch, Anthony.  You're just tweaking it.  We'll come up with a TV show.  That was a tweak right there. 
[01:15:30]  Warren, what's up?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  What do you got today?  I was bringing up the fact that Bartman, Steve Bartman, the guy went over, reached, grabbed that foul ball,  and the outfielder, Moises DeLue, went nuts.  And basically, they blew the game, and then everyone was blaming him for blowing the World Series.  They put that guy in witness protection program.  Is that really true?  That sounds like he's a legend.  Well, I mean, more or less, he had to leave his job.  He took a leave of absence and everything.  I mean, it was crazy.  They just lambasted him.  Yeah, I've never heard from him again. 
[01:16:00]  I mean, the guy went under.  Yeah, I mean, all the photoshops that were out with that guy, I mean, the guy was just a big baseball fan, and he just was an overzealous fan.  Yeah, but I never understood why all those other people who were standing up, reaching up for the ball around them, they didn't get just as much shit.  They just didn't have the lockups.  The intent was there.  The intent was there.  And you know what?  We've all been at baseball games.  We're all reaching for that ball, because you're not thinking in that situation.  Like, holy shit, it's coming right at me.  And you get excited, and you're not thinking. 
[01:16:30]  It's like the end of The Accused, right?  She's getting banged on that pinball machine.  People start cheering on.  Hey, you're next.  I mean, yeah.  Caught up in the moment.  Caught up in the moment.  Yeah, caught up in the moment.  There you go.  Oh, by the way, no, I didn't sit on my daddy's shoulders and watch Chicago win the last one.  Other people are coming up with interesting 1917 facts.  Yeah.  Anthony drops out of high school. 
[01:17:00]  Bunch of bastards you are.  1917.  That is very funny.  Bunch of comedians, aren't you?  All right.  There you go.  If you want real baseball talk, the guys are going to be doing it at home plate later today,  175.  We like Rob Dibble a lot, and Kevin Kennedy.  They're great guys.  Elo says baseball talk is alive and well.  That's right.  And they got Hank Aaron on today.  That's pretty cool.  They do a really good show if you're a baseball fan.  The Hammers. 
[01:17:30]  3 o'clock on the East Coast on 175.  We're going to break with Bill Burr and Scott Farrell going at it here.  Listen to this.  All right, let's start with baseball.  What's your thoughts on baseball?  Well, last night I was losing weight watching that game.  I mean, it was one sip.  Oreos, they blow to begin with.  The only thing they got there is good crab cakes.  But all of a sudden, A-Rod came up and pimped one out.  And then they got it when Jeter was the signal to the right.  And they take the 2-1 lead.  They hold on.  They get it on Gordon.  Moe, and now they go one more against these crappy O's. 
[01:18:00]  Beat them tonight.  Have a one-game lead.  Because Toronto beat Boston.  It's going to be crazy.  It's Femway all weekend.  They're going to be watching as the Bombers go in there to take on the red Fems.  I can't wait.  I'm pulling hair out between the football and the baseball.  I may start kicking my dog.  We got a Red Sox fan in studio, Bill Burr.  Well, it's going to be thick.  Your boy, Arroyo, couldn't get it done last night.  Wells jacked one over the wall and left.  They're not pitching well.  Schilling's been getting lit. 
[01:18:30]  Let's face it.  They lose Fulk.  They've lost everybody.  Their bullpen blows.  Their rotation's getting lit like a bong.  The Yankees go in there on fuego.  They've been beating the shit out of everybody.  You lost like 19 to fucking 90 the other night, you jackass.  We had a good night last night, and I'm going to sum up the whole baseball season on that.  And I'm going to regurgitate everything that I saw in SportsCenter.  Shut up.  Fucking jackass.  You're up one game with your $200 million team that could. 
[01:19:00]  It was unbelievable.  Then A-Rod got up.  He got a hit.  Then Jeter.  Then Jesus Christ is on deck.  And it was just fucking amazing that they pulled it out against the Orioles.  This is unbelievable.  Got Dolly Lama in the bullpen.  You guys just win it every fucking year.  Holy shit.  I can have martinis or whatever.  You, like, talk about that politics shit to people.  They must fucking hate you, dude.  You're just painful.  You're just mad because I got you with some good points. 
[01:19:30]  You got nothing.  You're filibustering.  Shut your face.  Go get a fucking cough drop, jackass.  Eat another hot dog and have a heart attack.  Whatever, you homo.  You get no trim because you talk about that shit.  What does that have to do about getting pussy as you sit there fucking eating your soggy cornflakes  watching fucking SportsCenter?  You're so funny, dude.  What do you talk about Kabul and Afghanistan and Iraq?  That was Anthony.  Why don't you pay attention, you fucking drug whore? 
[01:20:00]  I love you.  Come down off the crystal meth.  I love when you get a Red Sox fan and a Yankee fan.  Oh, my God.  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself and he's just ugly and his nose is falling off.  Don't drop it.  He's an asshole. 
[01:20:30]  Eric Nagel is this bisexual and confident radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like what he's saying.  I mean, he's not really that smart.  He can go fuck himself.  He can go fuck himself.  Raphael Calmero.  What a douche. 
[01:21:00]  What do we got here?  Ah, Disturbed.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Thanks for checking us out once again today.  This is off the new album?  I think so, yeah, right?  I like this shit.  These motherfuckers are just the best.  It's kind of a sad day.  Bill Burr now is going away for a little while.  What?  What a mess.  If you say Voss is sitting in that seat, I'm going to punch someone in the head.  It'll just be a surprise who's sitting there on Monday, I guess. 
[01:21:30]  You know, we were really depressed that Jimmy was leaving for a while.  That was a real bummer.  And then Bill Burr steps in and it's been great.  It's been absolutely great.  You know how well it worked?  Old Darren, new Darren.  That's how well the transition was.  Different guy, different face, but the people didn't seem to care.  Right.  They were just as happy watching Esmeralda get pissed at new Darren as they were old Darren.  Same thing.  It's still bewitched.  Right. 
[01:22:00]  It's still bewitched.  Look, Sam is still there.  Uncle Arthur's still there.  All people I'm familiar with.  Darren changed, but that's okay.  Well, Larry Tate.  I can't compete with Norton's transvestite getting shit on stories.  I got nothing.  But it's okay.  It's okay.  People love it.  People have embraced you, Bill.  They have been cool because I was really expecting a brutal trashing like this guy doesn't get hookers.  No.  We were expecting it too.  We thought you would get at least hammered for the first week or something. 
[01:22:30]  19 of 20 days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, they just fucking adore you.  It worked out well.  And now, what are the odds that's going to happen with a third person?  Now, Bill's got to go somewhere.  We bring someone in.  You think all our listeners are going to be...  Maybe it's you guys.  Almost like how a good player makes the players around better.  No.  No.  No.  No.  It is absolutely not us.  Well, next week on the Opie and Anthony program...  Give me some credit.  Nah, don't bother.  Let me tell you this. 
[01:23:00]  Next week on the Opie and Anthony program, we will have the third Darren Stevens...  Third never works.  ...the fourth Darren Stevens, and we will go all the way to the fifth Darren Stevens.  Oh, that never works.  Like the Jets.  Right.  You're going to have that guy, Brooke, what's his face?  We're going to the fifth string.  Vinny Testaverde in studio.  I talked in a mic a couple of times last week.  I said, I haven't really done much.  We have three different people sitting in next week for Jimmy Norton and Bill Burr. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah?  Yes.  And then Bill's going to...  Then Jimmy comes back for, I don't know, two or three days, and then he's gone for another  two or three weeks, and Bill's going to hopefully, you know, spend a lot more time with us again.  Maybe we should just do an All in the Family, Archie Bunker's Place transition, where everyone  leaves.  It's just like one character, like us, but we completely change the setting and everything.  And the show is no longer even a pale reflection of its former self. 
[01:24:00]  I'm looking forward to the day we just franchise this out.  That's it?  Hire a new Opie, hire a new Anthony, hire a new Bill Burr, hire a new Jim Norton.  And just let them run with it?  And we just sit home and collect the checks.  I like that part.  For coming up with the idea.  I like that part of it.  Why not?  Yeah, once a month you do a phoner.  Yeah, hey, how's it going?  We own the name Opie and Anthony.  It's like those bands out there.  They just keep replacing everybody.  That's it.  We heard about what happened with, what was it, Foghat?  Is that a true story, I think? 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  They tore with his mustache.  The drummer's mustache is all that's left.  Who knows?  But Bill will be in Sacramento next weekend.  I actually bond with that bus story there that that dude from Ministry was telling.  You did?  Yeah.  I tried to actually retell that fucking story.  Oh, no.  It's like a 20-minute story.  Yeah.  30 seconds in, I'm bombing.  Oh, no.  I'm just trying to run to the end.  Get to the end.  Yeah, this girl's just looking at me like, yeah, it must have been great. 
[01:25:00]  It's been something.  Yeah, he kind of had an inimitable style about that story.  Yeah.  Very hard to translate.  Oh, I'm talking about bombing.  No, no.  Listen, we've got to go to the phone.  Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I just realized you and Ant are kind of like Van Halen and Jimmy and David Lee Roth  and Bill Burrman and Sammy Hagar.  Oh, no.  No, don't even say it.  We're not going to that extreme guy.  Gary Cherone. 
[01:25:30]  Gary Cherone.  Oh, my.  No.  No, don't do that to us.  Oh, the guy that sits in the seat next week is Gary Cherone.  He's the third guy sitting in that seat.  Oh, no.  That didn't work.  That didn't work too well.  The Hagar thing worked.  And then David Lee Roth comes back for a little while, and then he leaves again.  Yeah.  And then Sammy Hagar will be back.  A little while.  That's a great analogy, Chris. 
[01:26:00]  All right, guys.  Listen, hey, I'm singing live while I see you guys about 31st.  Looking forward to it.  Wait, wait.  You sing for them?  Yeah.  Oh, awesome, man.  You guys are really good.  Thank you very much.  Looking forward to it.  Yeah, it's our Halloween party.  We're just starting to hype this thing.  This is going to be a huge, huge party.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing two things.  We're obviously having a Halloween party with 2U, which is Anthony's brother's U2 tribute  band.  They're great.  And we picked you guys as well.  You guys do the ACDC thing.  Yes, we do.  Thank you very much. 
[01:26:30]  Great job, man.  Absolutely.  Really good.  And then we got a Rush tribute band as well.  21-12.  And those guys are unbelievable, too.  Unbelievable.  When you see a guy trying to cover Rush, you're so super critical of how he sounds because  Getty's got such a distinctive voice, and this guy totally pulls it off.  Yeah, can we get some samples of Live Wire and the Rush tribute band, 21-12?  Either for Monday or later today, whatever.  Yeah, this Halloween party is huge because, like I said, it's a Halloween party, but it's  also celebrating a year on XM. 
[01:27:00]  Yep.  Because we were trying to do something special, and we couldn't really figure it out, and  then Halloween was close, so we're like, ah, let's just throw it all together.  Right down there at the new Hard Rock in Times Square.  Yeah, that's going to be great.  Only 600 people could get into the party, by the way.  Only 600 people.  Limited space.  Limited space, and we're looking for people to dress up as characters from the Opie and  Anthony program.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything we've ever talked about in the last year, or even in our past, if you want to  go old school, because we've got a lot of old listeners.  You could be the wiffle ball bat.  Exactly.  You want to dress like the wiffle ball bat.  That's open. 
[01:27:30]  Any characters from the show.  Anything.  Anything we have talked about that you think you could turn into a character.  Bill Burr is now open.  Your open season on Bill Burr.  That's right.  You want to put on your Bill Burr costume.  That's right.  And we're going to have some great prizes for the winners.  It's going to be just a great, great day.  And we'll see you there, Chris.  On it goes Gary Sharon.  All right.  Gary Sharon.  Oh, is that the war?  No shit.  Let's say hi to Pete in Philly.  Hey, Pete.  Yo, fellas.  How are you?  What's up?  Hey, man.  I just want to say Bill Burr has fucking killed for the last two weeks, and I'm going 
[01:28:00]  to miss the dude.  Yeah, no.  He'll be back.  Oh, thanks, man.  He'll be back.  And even when Jimmy comes back full time, Billy is going to be a big part of this show.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell Sugar Tits he doesn't need to come back?  Full time.  Oh, boy.  You know something.  Hey, for the Halloween party, doesn't it have your audience look like boss anyway?  Wow.  Bro.  Wow.  Wow.  That hit his phone.  Wow.  We all have our haters out there.  Why does this guy want to correct me?  I'm bewitched.  I thought I had all my bewitched facts, right? 
[01:28:30]  Sir, Brian, what happened with my bewitched?  Hey, Sam's mother is Indora, not Esmeralda.  Oh, Indora, right.  Esmeralda is the other one, the cousin or something.  Isn't that from the Smurfs or something?  Esmeralda?  No, Esmeralda was a character on the show, but you're right.  It was Indora was the mother, the bitchy mother-in-law.  Very good.  Thank you, Brian.  All right.  Thank you.  Happy birthday to Bill.  Again.  That whole gag.  See, we lost a lot of our friends when we were doing the old show, so we're very excited 
[01:29:00]  that Bill has worked out so well.  Oh, yeah.  Because we lost the likes of, you know, Jay Moore, who's still a friend of the show.  He just doesn't participate like he used to.  Very busy.  Then we had the dice thing that went away, and Jim Brewer went away, so, you know, Bill's  going to fit in quite nicely as we move forward.  So, we're very happy about that, without a doubt.  Well, Brewer went over to the other place.  And then Dice is the one that was really just out of, it seems, scumbaggedness.  The guy just decided, you know, fuck those guys. 
[01:29:30]  That's too bad.  I don't need them no more.  We don't need you.  Thank you.  Have fun.  Enjoy.  Enjoy the rest of your career.  Yeah, you could have had that crowd at the garden, that show you did.  Yeah, that crowd would have been there, if you hadn't done our show for a month straight  before that.  Right.  Stop it.  Hey, we're getting a nice hickory dickory.  Shut up.  We're getting a nice hit in the Washington Post today, for all you people down in the  D.C. area. 
[01:30:00]  XM's new weapon, a DirecTV link-up.  D.C. radio company offering 72 channels free to satellite TV subscribers.  They got a picture of your pals, Opie and Anthony.  A pretty big picture in the article, actually.  Anthony looking completely thrilled to be there.  I remember when this was taken.  Why do they keep using this picture?  Let me see.  Oh, I didn't see this.  I got this cheap...  Look at the picture they gave me.  Here.  It's right there to your right.  Oh.  It's all staticky.  I don't understand this.  You know, you get a photographer in studio and they take a picture and then this picture 
[01:30:30]  is used for the next, like, three or four years.  Yeah.  And this is, like, the worst picture.  Anthony's just staring into space because I'm making a point, you know, so you're just  kind of waiting to talk because we're being interviewed.  And I'm using, like, weird hand signals and I'm looking off to the side.  And that's the picture they used time and time again.  This was fucking...  Isn't this the stupidest picture?  Dude, do you remember this?  We were exhausted.  Yeah, because we just started.  We didn't know what to expect with this morning thing.  And we're getting up at, like, three in the morning, getting here at 4.30, just stupid 
[01:31:00]  shit.  That's great.  And we're doing all sorts of interviews in the beginning because it was a big deal.  We were coming to Satellite and it was one of many interviews we did.  And that's right.  The guy was just taking pictures as he's talking to us.  What?  You're wearing the same shirt.  Oh, yeah.  I just realized.  You were.  I was looking to see if I was.  But I'm wearing my doll shirt that...  In this picture, I'm wearing my doll shirt that Bill was making fun of.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  My generic shirt.  You wear one every day.  You got another one on. 
[01:31:30]  It's got a little something.  It's a sailboat.  What is that?  It's a sailboat passing a lighthouse, for your information.  Jesus.  Will you shut up, dude?  We're trying to...  We're trying to keep our cool factor off.  Where do you get those?  Those are like...  J.C. Penney?  I don't know where this one is.  Yeah.  This is Nautica.  This is a Nautica shirt, my friend.  All right.  All right. 
[01:32:00]  Nautica.  Hence the nautical motif on the front.  All right.  I love yours.  It's a pigeon.  You've got a Western-style shirt.  It's a buttoned shirt with the Western-style pockets.  The little thing kind of goes down.  Do you have a yoke in the back?  A Western-style yoke?  This is a...  I'm going to be a TV shirt.  And there's a dove.  It's a pigeon.  It's a pigeon.  It's an actual pigeon?  Pigeons don't carry fig leaves or whatever that is.  Olive branch fig leaf.  What am I talking about?  This is one of these shirts. 
[01:32:30]  If some of the women would like it, you're like, oh my God, that's a nice shirt.  And they start touching your chest.  It's really nice.  But every guy fucking trashes you.  What's with the bird over your tit, dude?  What's up with the bird, huh?  Hey, what are you a fucking fag over here?  Hey.  I got a fag your shirt.  I don't know what to tell you.  Women seem to like it for some reason.  And isn't that the only thing that matters?  I'm out of intro lines, so yeah, I got to put on a flashy shirt.  I'm not trying to attract you, dick.  It's like plumage for a bird, you know, and you actually used a bird. 
[01:33:00]  I can't believe I've been in here for almost two hours as you finally...  I've been trying to hunch you over.  I know.  He's turning that pigeon away from us.  Oh, don't worry, Bill.  We take a look around right away.  Bill just think it's a brown shirt.  And we'll get around to this stuff.  I knew it because I heard there was kind of a weird tone in Obie's voice that came.  He's like, morning, Bill.  Hey, morning.  And he's literally thinking, 20 minutes out of the radio, beautiful.  A bit just came walking in.  Well, that's exactly what happens. 
[01:33:30]  You're in the office and you're trying to figure out what the fuck you're going to do with this  particular show.  And then Radio Gold walks in and says hi to everybody.  Unbeknownst.  We get so excited when someone fucks up around here.  Oh, yeah.  The day that Anthony walked in with the periwinkle shirt.  Periwinkle blue shirt I walked in with and I got just murdered for that.  The day that Eric decided to come in with bad breath.  It's like, holy shit, Radio Gold.  This is how you know everybody in that little war room there is just like unbelievably nice  to you and cordial.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  What's up?  You're going to be in the barrel. 
[01:34:00]  And we all give looks to each other like you see that, right?  The eyes open real wide for half a second.  Oh, the second you sat down and put your head in the paper, in the newspaper, in the office,  Opie pointed at his right tit and went, fucking bird.  And I go to Ben.  And it's a really tight office where I'm like, Ben.  And then I'm giving the head movement toward you, like, write this down on the prep sheet.  Sure.  Anyway, the Washington Post with a big, goofy picture of your pals, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  The article, I'll just read the first two paragraphs real fast.  DirecTV satellite subscribers will be able to tune in several XM satellite radio channels  free beginning in November.  That's cool.  I was wondering when the deal was going to start.  Nice.  XM announced this yesterday, escalating the Washington company's war with New York rival  Sirius satellite radio.  It's not a war against those guys at all.  Eek.  It's like what we did to Baghdad the first time around.  It's not even close.  I guess technically that was a war.  It's not even close. 
[01:35:00]  It's not even close anymore.  DirecTV is the nation's leading satellite service with more than 14 million customers.  And starting on November 15th, they will receive 72 of XM's music and talk channels,  including the adult-oriented high-voltage channel, which features shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, they use the shock jock?  Yeah.  They're starting to use other things instead of shock jocks.  Shock.  Beach bags.  Opie and Anthony.  Fired from WNAW in New York for broadcasting a couple claiming to have sex in St. Patrick's 
[01:35:30]  Cathedral.  Oh, yeah.  In nice, bold writing.  I forgot about that.  I'm so glad they remind me in every article that's written about us.  At least this time, like you pointed out.  Look at me all arrogant like they shouldn't mention it.  Why can't we just be judged on our other merits?  It's like Hugh Grant.  No matter what you're typing, there's always a fucking poker blowjob mugshot hunched over  picture thing.  That's all I remember him for.  Well, the exposure for us and XM in general through DirecTV is just absolutely huge. 
[01:36:00]  Fantastic.  And thank you to Hugh and the gang for including us, because they didn't have to.  No.  This seems more like a music deal type of thing.  Yeah, you know, every cable outlet or satellite outlet, they have those channels.  You get up there in the channels, you keep going around, you're looking for movies,  and then boom, you hit the music.  All of a sudden, you got 80s, you got the dance mix, party mix music.  It was funny, because I asked Elo, I'm like, what channel will we be on?  He goes, let me look. 
[01:36:30]  And I heard.  Oh, yeah.  Over and over, right?  He goes, you're going to be on channel.  I don't know if this is the exact channel, but I know this is the ballpark.  Around there.  You're going to be on channel 832.  That's a nice, memorable number.  Or it's probably, you know what that is?  That's probably their wasteland.  Right.  It's their wasteland of programming around it.  On my cable system, I go up into like, I don't know, like the 400s every once in a while. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  And I go, wow, there's some amazing things going on up here.  What's up here?  But you rarely go up there.  You don't go up there.  You know?  But it's like the Reader's Digest channel.  Right.  And some mamba music on the other side of us.  Big band swing.  Yeah, we will be surrounded by just nothingness.  So, to ensure people don't accidentally stumble upon us during one of our blue conversations.  Is that the actual channel?  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  879?  Yeah, I was watching channel 800 yesterday.  I had a big advertisement for XM coming to DirecTV.  Oh, yeah.  And it said channel 879.  For high voltage.  Yeah, high voltage.  How about that, kids?  In about a month and a half.  That's going to be very, very huge.  All right, let's say hi to Jamie.  Jamie, what's up?  Yeah.  How you doing?  Yeah.  What up, Jamie?  Dude, I'm drunk as shit, but I have a Ben's Hog costume. 
[01:38:00]  He's going to dress as Ben's Hog for the Halloween show.  We might have to have an individual costume contest for Ben's Hog costumes, because I think  that one's going to be very popular.  The biggest Ben's Hog, maybe, because that'll make it really inconvenient for the wearers  of the costume, and anything that puts our listeners into any pain gives us pleasure.  They have enough material.  I'm excited to see these costumes from the stage, because you know there's going to be  ones that we never thought of that are just going to be brilliant.  The listeners are going to come up with some great costumes for this thing. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, people, I'm reading instant feedback, people want to come as moths from my house.  Like, that's a pretty obscure little costume to come as, and I'm sure there's going to  be somewhere where we're going to look and have to figure it out.  You know, it'll probably be from a while ago, but that's pretty cool.  And someone else was asking if there's going to be comics.  Well, let's see what Doug has to say.  Doug, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I know you were tossing around in the beginning there, you know, some of the comedians that  might show up doing some sets.  You guys still playing on doing that?  Is this Doug out, Doug? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, bro?  I don't know, because you guys are a bunch of assholes when we have these things.  You don't allow the comics to, like, actually perform.  All right, fair enough.  I don't know.  We're going to try to figure it out.  We might go down that road.  Maybe some of the comics will at least say hi.  I don't know, to be honest.  I'd love to see a guy like Joe Rogan do his thing.  Yeah, I really don't know, because we know you guys are animals.  I mean, it'll be entertaining as hell.  We'll be up there introducing all the characters of the show.  Just spend your host set telling everybody to shut the fuck up, right? 
[01:39:30]  Of course.  No, fuck you.  Thanks a lot, everybody.  Yeah, we'll come up with...  I'm thinking of a seven-hour trip, so I want to be thoroughly entertained.  Oh, no, it's going to be a great party.  We guarantee that.  We've never had a bad party, so...  I think we'll come up with some really just fun things to do on that stage.  All right, guys.  Hey, did you get through to Howard's screener and fuck with them really bad?  Yeah, just a little bit.  You're just teasing for now, right?  Yeah, we're warming up.  I'm trying to get the troops excited for the big day. 
[01:40:00]  All right, very good.  Very good, bro.  Later, gentlemen.  Thanks, Doug.  What is he saying here?  Bobby Bigrigger.  Bobby Bigrigger.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Down here in D.C.  I was driving by headquarters earlier.  I picked up the Washington Post.  What the hell's with that picture, Ant?  Oh.  I don't know.  What the hell kind of hand signal is that?  It's really bizarre.  I don't know.  It is.  I don't even know what I was trying to describe.  Dude, we have both been up for about 24 hours straight.  Right.  We're sitting there.  I was falling asleep. 
[01:40:30]  I don't know what I'm doing with that left hand.  I'm stretching it.  Throwing up gang signs, motherfucker.  It is.  That's what it looks like.  I'm saying hi to my homies.  I mean, we all know the XM compound is in the middle of the ghetto.  Right.  I want to make sure I'm safe as I'm going in and out of that place.  Yeah, looking good, guys.  Looking good.  Very good.  Congratulations, Ken, all right?  Yeah, that's a huge deal for us.  Thanks.  Thank you, Bobby.  It just gets bigger and bigger every week for us.  Corey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Happy birthday, bud.  Gosh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:41:00]  I suck.  Oh, fuck.  Is Bob Edwards going to be on the old satellite?  Uh, no.  No.  No.  Wow, look at that.  He's doing his program.  What happened there?  The tides are changing.  We've finally educated some people down in Washington.  We're the big show.  We're the big show here now, pally.  We're the big show.  They signed us and Bob Edwards at the same time, and, you know, they were so much more 
[01:41:30]  excited that they signed Bob Edwards.  I don't know who that is.  I've been in radio.  Exactly.  We have nothing against Bob Edwards, but.  I'm like the, I'm like a Doogie Howser guy.  Like, I've been in radio since I was, I don't know, like 11.  Some ridiculous age.  I've been around a long time, right?  And, uh, I've never heard of the guy.  And I know everything.  Well, I try to know as much as I can about radio.  I should say.  I don't want to say everything.  But in the NPR world, he was huge.  Absolutely huge.  But I never heard of the guy.  And so they signed us and him at the same time. 
[01:42:00]  And actually, the lady, the lawyer lady that, uh, that signed us and went to dinner with  us, she actually left our celebratory dinner to go celebrate with Bob Edwards.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  How about that?  Oops.  In the beginning, we thought we were in deep trouble by, uh, by actually, you know, deciding  on XM over the other company because we're like, oh my God, did they even get it?  And then they hired Eric Logan and then it's been, uh, it's been fine ever since.  He's a nice enough guy and all.  You know, we've met him. 
[01:42:30]  We beat the shit out of him on our show and he really is a nice guy.  He's a nice guy, but sort of ghoulish.  He looks like he should be hosting one of those late night Channel 5 zombie movie festivals  or something.  Now let me tell you about the next feature.  Like, he's that kind of guy.  Smokes like crazy, I guess.  Goes out there, he's all gray.  But he's a good guy.  Yeah, but he's a good guy.  And, uh, you know, NPR radio is kind of like, uh, you know, I guess they're afraid the DirecTV 
[01:43:00]  satellite might snap off and fall asleep if they bounce the signal off of it.  It happens to the satellite.  Every time we, uh, uplink Bob Edwards, it just shuts off.  The solar array folds up and goes to sleep.  All right, why don't we say hi to Evangeline.  Evangeline.  Evangeline.  Yes.  Hi. 
[01:43:30]  Hello.  Hi.  Is this your picture we're looking at?  Yes, the blonde one.  I don't know, I had to send two pictures.  Oh, you're the blonde one?  Yes.  Yeah, hi.  Why did you send your picture?  Why?  Yeah.  Because I'd like to play What's in My Pants.  Oh!  Oh, okay.  That's nice.  Hey, who's your, who's your friend?  Uh, this is one of my friends from college.  And one of your friends from college?  And why isn't she playing?  Oh, babe.  No.  Stop it.  What's your name? 
[01:44:00]  Evangeline?  You're very lovely.  I'm looking at the picture.  Very lovely girl.  Thank you.  You could, you could, you could tell which one the cock blocker is.  I think, I think Stephen Lynch wrote a song about you.  Yeah.  Anyway, uh, so, uh, what's your deal?  Evangeline?  What's my deal?  Yeah.  Like, how old are you?  What do you do?  What do you do?  Okay.  Um, well, I'm 23 years old.  Oh.  Uh, right now I'm looking for a job. 
[01:44:30]  Oh.  Okay.  Um, I'm about 5'7".  5'7".  All right.  Tall gal.  Um, weighing about 135 pounds.  Mmm.  5'7", Opie.  5'7".  Take that into consideration.  Look at your chart, mister, just off the top of your head.  No, I...  Look at your chart.  5'7".  Do we really need to look at the chart today?  5'7".  If she was 5'5", that would be, uh, you know, maybe, uh, pushing it.  There's a slight problem.  Oh, I have one of those big bubble butts. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, I was going to say.  Yeah, that's nice.  Oh, is that it?  That's nice.  I like that.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right.  So, you're a little bottom heavy.  A little bit.  A little bit.  She's a big girl.  She's got some thighs on her.  Does your ass look like Tara Reade's?  We've all seen the picture.  I think it's in the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine.  Tara Reade's ass isn't so much big as it is just lumpy.  Tara Reade's butt is like, you know, when you fill up the, uh, the, uh, in-ground pool  too much and the sides start to buckle up the buckle. 
[01:45:30]  No, I don't have one of those.  That was the best I could come up with.  That doesn't actually happen, I know, but I was trying.  All right.  It's like if you were in a skirt, let's say, and, uh, you're in your gravel driveway.  You sat down to maybe change your tire, and then you got up, brushed the gravel off your  butt, and then took a picture of it.  Does it look like that?  Um, no.  Oh, good.  Okay.  All right.  She's had some sort of party here.  Yeah, what's the party?  She's had some cups in the background.  Yeah, look at that.  The, uh, the big, uh, beer, the red beer cups that always run out. 
[01:46:00]  Damn it.  Yeah, what was going on?  Sign of a date rape on the horizon.  Yeah, there's some college guys in the background already.  Already making their plan.  Look who they wanted.  Yeah.  Girls are touching each other, fucking dykes.  There's definitely a bunch of young go-getters.  Yeah.  All, uh, standing around the keg.  Yeah, what was this party?  Um, I think that was, um, I don't know, just a regular fall party.  It might have been near, um, coming.  A mixer.  Yeah, actually, uh, you're definitely not bad. 
[01:46:30]  You got blonde hair, right?  Yeah.  And, uh, what color are eyes?  Can't tell.  It's black and white.  Those are blue.  They're kind of like blue-green.  All right.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Okay.  You guys want to play Guess What's in My Pants with Evangeline?  This is good also because you can kind of see the texture of her natural hair, which will  help out, uh, in this game.  It's going to make it tougher to hear, actually.  Um, Angeline?  Yes.  Hi.  I'm going to explain to the listeners how this game works.  Okay.  Um.  Are you in your room? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  At home?  Yes.  Mom and dad?  No.  Were they at work?  No.  No.  Actually, I live by myself.  Oh, okay.  Ah, all right.  All right.  I love it.  Love it.  All right.  What we're going to do is have Angeline rub the phone, rub her phone on her most intimate  of areas, and she will rub, uh, in three ways.  Up and down, side to side, and the ever-telling circular passion.  And from the sounds we hear emanating from her telephone, Opie, we will try to decipher 
[01:47:30]  what type of hairstyle she is sporting in her lap.  The choices are the standard issue basic female triangle.  This can also be now clipped down, but it is still the standard issue triangle, even  if you're just kind of trimming it a little down.  Do you have a lot of sex?  Yes, I do.  You have a lot of sex.  That's going to influence my, uh, answer, by the way. 
[01:48:00]  It's a good question.  Because she's a whore.  I love that one.  And, uh, the next hairstyle would be the mohawk.  This is a mohawk.  It's a strip of hair, also called the landing strip, where you, uh, shave in the sides, and  you leave it from top to bottom.  Up to your navel.  Right.  Right up to the navel.  Down to the asshole.  Big, long strip.  Yeah, some people have a landing strip that's kind of like, uh, a little local airport that 
[01:48:30]  the Cessnas land at.  And some pretty much have JFK.  There's traffic coming in from all angles.  747, no problem.  Oh, they could land the biggest plane and still have plenty of runway at the end.  I like, I sometimes like the spot that just doesn't make any sense.  Ah.  No matter what angle you look at it.  The helipad.  It's just a little dot of nothingness.  Why did you leave it?  It looks like you missed.  It's a little too far from everything.  Yeah.  You know, it's too far.  It's too far from the actual workings of the vagina. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  It looks good when a girl is standing up, nude picture, crossing her legs.  Sure.  And standing there.  Yeah.  And that little tuft of hair just kind of sits there, and it looks good.  The second they're on their back with their legs behind their ears, it's like, why  does that look like the ninth hole at the Masters?  You know, that one that's just surrounded by water?  You've got to fucking chip it on.  I think it's the ninth hole.  I'm not sure what.  The 18th. 
[01:49:30]  We're with you, though.  We've all seen the water.  Oh, my God.  We've all seen it.  It's a useless tuft that just sits there.  It just looks ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  All right.  But that would be the Hitler mustache, or now the helipad.  It's pretty much a Hitler mustache.  It looks like a little tuft of hair.  Okay.  Then, of course, there is the wood floor.  This is clean shaven.  Nothing down there. 
[01:50:00]  We also, much to some people's disgust, like to call it the JonBenet Ramsey or the Conor  Peterson armpit, which Jim Norton dubbed it one day.  That's a Jim Norton Anthony thing.  They just laugh and laugh and laugh.  Well, is it not accurate?  Come on.  You take the horror out of it.  If you take the complete and utter horror out of it, it's very accurate.  All right.  So, we're going to be looking to Evangeline to rub the phone. 
[01:50:30]  And please, Evangeline, as we are guessing, no hints.  Don't go uh-huh or yes or mm or anything like that.  You keep silent until we ask you, indeed, what is in your pants.  Okay.  So, now take the phone.  Wait.  Wait.  What?  What about the wacky jingle?  Fuck the jingle.  All right.  Derek's got to burn his money.  Go ahead.  It's time to play.  That's the wacky.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[01:51:00]  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right.  Very nice.  Now that that theme song is out of the way, Evangeline, if you would please take the phone.  You got your panties completely off?  Yes.  Are you completely naked?  Yes.  Hey, hold on.  Is that the apprentice guy? 
[01:51:30]  It is?  Yeah.  I don't know what to talk to the apprentice guy about.  Let's have him play the game with us.  All right.  Hey, is this...  Hey, did we just lose the girl?  Oh, yeah, we did.  Son of a...  Oh, babe.  Wow.  Chris, I was supposed to pick you up on another bank.  Evangeline has got to call back.  Do we have our number by any chance?  Did you get our number?  No?  No, you didn't.  Holy crap, I wrecked the whole thing.  Okay, Evangeline, if you would please...  No, no, no, no, no. 
[01:52:00]  ...call back.  Turn down your radio.  I can't even talk today.  Turn down your radio.  Hey, Chris.  No?  And now we don't have the apprentice guy?  Wow, this is really bad radio.  All right, I just fucked up everything.  We have a jingle for that?  This fucking sucks.  Holy shit.  What happened?  All right.  We were just talking to her.  Huh?  Who's there?  Chris is there?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Chris.  Yes, sir. 
[01:52:30]  There he is.  You're on with Opie and Anthony.  We were going to do something nice with you, but I just fucked up everything.  Yeah, Opie screwed out of the pooch.  How are you doing today?  Blew the hatch.  I'm doing pretty well.  How are you guys?  Have you ever heard of a game called Guess What's in Your Pants?  Guess What's in My Pants.  No, I've never played a game called Guess What's in My Pants.  No, no, no.  We don't want to play with you.  We play with women on this fine radio show.  Oh, good.  And we were going to have you play along, you know?  And I hung up on the fine lady.  She was just about ready to play.  It's a guessing game.  Sort of a puzzle type thing.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  If she calls back, maybe we could do that with you.  Or do you have any numbers of whores that we could call?  Maybe a friend of yours.  No.  Everyone fucks so you're not cheating.  Hey, I watched The Apprentice last night.  What'd you think?  Dude, man, what the fuck did you do?  What did you do?  I made a business decision.  Yeah, but it was an error, wasn't it?  Even Donald Trump, and, you know, he's all about himself.  He was bummed that he had to fire you.  I noticed that. 
[01:53:30]  You know, I think we hit it off really well, and I did notice that, too.  It's something that I didn't get to see.  But, you know, I just made what I thought was a valid business decision, and I lived with it.  I'm just starting to get into The Apprentice, and, you know, I don't know much about this show.  I'm going to watch, though.  And you look like you had some business chops.  I'm like, wow, it's pretty obvious this guy's going to go a long way.  But you got obsessed with this guy, Marcus.  Right.  This guy, Marcus, is such an asshole.  He is a complete asshole, because it's kind of like the whole survivor thing. 
[01:54:00]  You've got to work with a team and stuff, you know.  Right.  But it's business things, and Marcus just was just, obviously, no one could work with this guy.  And you figured it was a good opportunity to get him thrown out of there, but it backfired on you.  No, it's not necessarily that it backfired.  I just made a decision that I would have made any day of the week in the real world.  I mean, think about it.  If you've got an organization that you're running, and you've got a bunch of people underneath you  that are trying to build your organization and make it a multimillion-dollar business, 
[01:54:30]  what type of people do you want on your team?  Do you want people that are superstars that are going to go out and bust their butt?  Or do you want a guy that literally talks you out of revenue?  And that was Marcus.  So I decided to bring him in the boardroom, and I decided that he was the guy that needed to go.  Here's my logic, though.  You know Marcus can't win this fucking thing, okay?  And you've got to look around the room and go, wow, that guy has some chops.  Whoa, that guy has some chops.  So you try to take out some of the stronger players.  Let the weak ones hang for a while.  Who cares? 
[01:55:00]  Well, you know, that's the game you play when you get down to the final two, the final three.  But when you're sitting here and you're a group of eight or nine people,  you've got to be in a position where you can beat the other team handedly day in and day out.  So if it was in the end, for the sake of the game, you've got to play your cards a little bit differently.  You just wanted him gone.  It was a personal thing, you know, because I guess how the show goes, you guys do these missions, right? 
[01:55:30]  It was for Lamborghini last night.  You've got to come up with an ad campaign for Lamborghini.  How hard is that?  It's a Lamborghini.  Jesus.  And the guys lost to the girls.  Great.  Can you afford it?  Yeah.  You'd think the guys would have, that would have been a piece of cake thing for guys, right?  Well, that's what we thought going into it.  It's guys.  It's cars.  Everybody had a picture of a Lamborghini on their wall when we were little, you know.  It was just one of those things that we thought we had in the bag from day one.  But as you saw on the show last night, we got our asses kicked. 
[01:56:00]  Literally, they got their asses kicked.  The girls had a much better concept and commercial and print ad for Lamborghini.  These guys, you know, the guy you had to present to, one of the muckety-mucks, head muckety-mucks  from Lamborghini, is looking at him just with this look on his face.  Was it like the A&E pitch meeting?  Oh, pretty much.  And then they're showing their print advertising and have to explain what the guy is supposed  to see in the ad.  And I'm sitting at home going, oh, boy.  They're explaining how water is this thing.  Oh, it's supposed to symbolize things? 
[01:56:30]  You want to explain, Chris, or what?  Well, you know, here's my two cents worth, if that's worth anything.  It was a marketing presentation.  So in a marketing presentation, when you're pitching a presentation to somebody, you have  to point out what the subtleties of the presentation are.  So I was making a point of each and every issue.  You know, it was our opinion that the ad spoke for itself.  It was our opinion that it didn't.  Yeah, it seems to me if you're pointing out every subtlety, they're not, you know, maybe 
[01:57:00]  there's too many subtleties.  Oh, maybe there were.  It's too subtle.  I would think.  They were trying to figure if they should capitalize the word Italian.  Right.  I would say yes.  Well, they decided no.  I would say yes.  And they're talking to a Lamborghini guy, and he's like, what's wrong with the Italians,  basically?  I would say capitalize the word Italian and put it right above the huge set of tits that  should be resting on the hood.  Because that's what sells, my friend.  Well, you know, I've got a family full of Italians that have left me about 600 voicemail 
[01:57:30]  messages that all want to take my head off.  What's the matter with you?  What did the women do that was so much better?  Yeah, what did they do?  That was great.  You know, they were just buttoned up.  They were solid.  They made it all about the car.  You know, the women dressed in all black where they had a yellow car.  And they talked about how the car is the star.  And Linda Kaplan-Faylor, one of the decision makers, said, there's a prime example.  Men say it.  Women feel it.  And they felt it last night.  I'll tell you what.  It was an awesome presentation.  And then they had a green Lamborghini. 
[01:58:00]  And then the slogan was Green Envy, right?  We had a poster with a green Lamborghini that said, Green with Envy.  Green with Envy.  I'm sorry.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, but they were trying to figure out if it should end.  No, man.  Man, man.  Man's shaking his head no.  If it should end in a period or a question mark.  And Marcus decided it should end in a question mark.  And they went with the period.  Right?  Exactly.  Why would a question mark make any sense?  Well, they wanted to know if it was a question.  Are you green with Envy?  Or is it green with Envy as a statement? 
[01:58:30]  I mean, it was a very minor issue.  I think it's such a statement.  I think with a Lamborghini, there's no question involved.  Exactly.  You are absolutely green with Envy.  There is no question when it comes to a Lamborghini.  Right.  And then the guys have to film a TV commercial.  And Marcus's job, this guy's just a tool.  You've got to watch The Apprentice.  I hate to say this for Marcus because he's just a tool, as you say.  And his whole job was to tell the Lamborghini went, what, start coming toward the cameras?  I gave Marcus the responsibility.  He gave him the simplest job, this guy, Chris. 
[01:59:00]  Go ahead, Chris.  Directing traffic.  I said, here's the deal.  You call the driver of the Lamborghini and send him down when I tell you to do it.  And he couldn't get it done.  I mean, it was the smallest job.  Oh, my God.  And when I finally, you know, I finally, I just said, that's it.  He's done.  I'm not going to put the fate of this task in his hands and give him any more responsibility.  And he proved the first week that he certainly couldn't manage.  And he proved the second week that he certainly couldn't handle responsibility.  Now, why on earth, then, was this guy kept and you thrown out?  I'll explain, Anthony. 
[01:59:30]  Thank you, Opie.  Because then these guys lost, so now they're all in the boardroom with Donald Trump.  That, got to say it, that twat of a woman.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy crap, is she tough.  Sorry, Chris.  No, hey.  I know.  That's not Chris saying it.  She just comes across, I guess, she comes across great for the show.  Very bitchy and very, ugh.  Yeah, supposed to be like that.  And then Trump's right-hand man, which is an older guy that seems like he's very knowledgeable in the business world himself.  So then they have to explain, you know, what went wrong and stuff. 
[02:00:00]  And the whole team is basically saying they just don't like Marcus.  They need him out, blah, blah, blah.  But in the end, Donald Trump decided that that's not the reason why these guys lost to the women.  Marcus.  Mr. Trump felt, you know, absolutely.  My thought process was, this guy obviously is a loose cannon.  I would not want him on your team.  Nobody would want him on his team.  He has to go.  Whereas Mr. Trump said, good point.  However, you know, the end of the day is he was not the direct reason you lost this task. 
[02:00:30]  So, therefore, he let me go.  You want to hear some audio?  We've got to play some audio of Marcus, if you don't mind there, Chris.  You've got a few more minutes with us?  Sure.  Okay.  Here's Marcus talking.  He talks in a meeting despite being told not to, Anthony.  I told the team, I don't want you guys going in the meeting with any preconceived ideas about Lamborghini whatsoever.  I don't want you to think slogans.  I don't want you to think campaigns.  I don't want you to think anything because we don't know what the client wants.  What's up, buddy?  I already have what I think is a winning slogan. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Okay.  So, you basically told everyone not to talk in the meeting, right?  I said, before we meet with the client, I don't want you thinking anything, saying anything, doing anything.  We don't know what they want.  And what does he do?  Comes up and says, I've got a winning slogan.  Yeah.  You're meeting the big guys from Lamborghini.  Right.  So, it's just a get-to-know meeting and try to feel them out, see what direction they might want to go in and stuff like that.  The first rule in marketing.  You've got to know what the client wants to make happen.  So, this guy, Marcus, speaks up right away, even though Chris, who was the project manager, said, let's just feel this out first. 
[02:01:30]  Listen.  Mythbusters meets Jackass.  He was convinced that he had the perfect slogan for the new Lamborghini, what's the word I'm looking for?  Campaign.  Campaign.  Thank you.  I already have what I think is a winning slogan.  Before we meet with them, you have a winning slogan?  Really?  Yeah.  So, when I say Linda, I'd like to share it with the group of her and just bounce off and see who she has.  What is it?  I don't want, I don't want to be surprised. 
[02:02:00]  What is it?  Just saying.  Smooth as silk.  It might be a little premature.  Let me just say, I think it's great.  I mean, it's awesome you have that.  But it might not be the best idea to come up with a slogan before we even meet with the client.  I didn't want anyone to think in cliches.  The biggest no-no in advertising is using cliches.  Of course, the first thing Marcus does, he comes up to me and he says, I've got a slogan idea.  I said, Marcus, no.  We want to find out what they're trying to make happen.  So, we're experiencing in the last two years exponential growth and that's due to a new model that we came out with, which is the Gallardo. 
[02:02:30]  And this is the beginning of the rebirth of Lamborghini.  One of the ideas that I had talked to my teammates about, just to kind of float it, was to have a complete counterbalance, if you would, or a contrast.  Smooth as silk.  Does that kind of imagery or something, does that tend to be something that would be of any interest to Lamborghini, do you think?  No?  Okay, very good.  Let me just eliminate those things.  See, Chris, this guy, Chris, he knows what he's doing and he told Marcus, don't suggest this in the meeting. 
[02:03:00]  And the Lamborghini guy just shut him down fast.  Why did this ass blurt that out?  That was a funny part of the meeting.  It was one of those things where the second he started opening his mouth, everybody just sort of bit their cheek and was like, oh no.  Here it comes, right.  I like how you actually tried to handle it, like feed his ego to still shut him up, like when he goes, smooth as silk.  And you're like, in your head, you're like, that fucking blows.  But you're like, okay, that's cool, but maybe let's just wait on it. 
[02:03:30]  No preconceived notions here.  Let's just see what he wants.  Right.  Let's sit and wait.  Smooth as silk.  You're probably like, oh, that stinks.  It was rough.  It was rough.  But guys, listen, I enjoyed this.  I'm getting waved that I've got to go on to my next day.  Of course.  Yeah, they're telling us you've got to go.  All right, Chris.  But hey, I appreciate the time.  No worries.  Great show, guys.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Bye.  Chris from The Apprentice.  Smooth as silk.  He got knocked out yesterday. 
[02:04:00]  I didn't even know Lamborghini even needed to advertise.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Yeah, I know.  It's a Lamborghini.  Right.  If you can afford it, you buy it.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Tell us when you've made it in life.  Yeah.  When you have enough money, we're here for you.  That's it.  They don't need like, wow, we're good.  People think this is a good car.  No, we know.  It's a Lamborghini.  Yeah, we're trying to compete with the Escort this year.  Any sort of ad campaign you can come up with?  I don't know.  Ford Taurus?  Lamborghini?  I'm still flipping that coin. 
[02:04:30]  I'm not sure.  Just to quickly wrap it up.  So they lose, and then Chris decides who he wants to bring back into the boardroom as potential  people that Donald Trump could fire.  Yeah.  I think he could pick two.  And then Donald Trump decides if the project manager...  Which he was.  Which Chris was.  Now, how did he get to be project manager?  I guess they vote on that ahead of time.  Why would you want to be project manager?  I don't know.  To show what you got, I guess.  You know what I'm saying?  Yes.  Why would you want to be?  If your team wins as project manager, you're eligible to be exempt from being fired next 
[02:05:00]  week.  Oh, oh.  It's a gamble.  It's one of those things.  I'd lay low under the radar a little bit.  Not fucking up so bad, but not really pushing anything.  But just sit and simmer.  But here's the logic.  So now you're the project...  That's what I do here.  You're the project manager, right?  Yeah.  And Donald Trump now decides if your campaign or whatever, your task was so awful as a leader  that you have to go, or if you did the best you can and it was people around you 
[02:05:30]  that fucked up very key things they needed to do.  And it's him based on his expertise to figure out what it was.  Was it you not leading or your...  Yeah.  But then Chris, as the guy, can bring in two other choices for Donald Trump to fire, whether  it's going to be Chris or the two guys Chris picked, one of those guys.  But Chris, because he's so obsessed with this Marcus guy, only picks Marcus thinking it's  a no-brainer that he'll fire Marcus over him.  Wait, you can pick one or two guys?  He just decided to pick one because he was like, I don't want to badmouth anymore on my 
[02:06:00]  team.  This is the problem.  And it backfired on him.  This is what Trump did.  I mean, this is a very tough one for me.  I'll be honest with you.  It's very, very tough.  Because I think you're somewhat of a disaster, Marcus, really.  You talk too much.  People don't like you.  You know, Chris, unfortunately, I have to be honest with you.  I asked you to make a smart business decision and you made an emotional one.  Marcus was not the reason you lost this task.  And I was saying, don't bring him back in because he was the only one who was right. 
[02:06:30]  And I'm telling you, don't bring him back in.  Bring in Mark.  Get Mark back in the room.  You're fired, Chris.  Fuck you.  You've got great potential, man.  Get out of here.  You've got great potential.  Get out of here.  Yeah, he really just should not have been fired.  But he was like, you know.  Wow.  That's.  He just had a personal thing with his Marcus ass.  So.  That's fucked up.  And here's Chris leaving.  Marcus will not last.  If you've got a bunch of people on your boat and they're all rowing in one direction, 
[02:07:00]  one guy on the other side isn't rowing, your boat's just going to spin in place and you're  not going to get anywhere.  You're not going to make any progress.  That was our next pitch.  But not only was Marcus not rowing, he wasn't even, didn't even have his hands on the paddle.  He was facing the other direction, drinking a martini, talking to the captain.  I'm very busy rowing.  There you go.  The Apprentice on NBC.  All right.  Very nice.  All right.  Where were we?  Evangeline.  Evangeline. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  Hi.  Opie hung up on you.  By accident.  I really didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.  Yeah.  Can you wait through the commercial?  Because I've got to take a leak now.  Okay.  Do you mind?  You can.  You're not getting pissed?  No, that's all right.  Or he wants to call you back so you save some phone charges?  If they can do that, sure.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We'll figure it all out.  Okay.  And we'll play, guess what's in my pants.  You hung up on it.  No, I didn't.  We'll play that next.  Breaking news across the XM nation.

[02:09:30]  All right, we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program.  I thought we'd go long break there.  That was nice. 
[02:10:00]  Ah, I was able to take a leak.  All right, let's get Evangeline back on the line to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Yes, we were interrupted for a little while, but got to get back to business.  Guess What's in My Pants.  Want to reset the plate here, Anthony?  Well, uh...  Reset the tables, they say.  Evangeline, is that her name?  From Philly.  Yes, from Philly.  She sent us a picture of herself and her friend at some kind of college party.  Two cute girls.  And Evangeline, the blonde-haired one, decides she wants to play Guess What's in My Pants. 
[02:10:30]  We explained all the rules, we played the song, and then we got a phone call.  Yeah, Evangeline?  And it kind of interrupted what we were doing.  Evangeline, are you still a nude?  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  But we apologize, I mean, you got bumped for the guy from The Apprentice, so...  Did you watch that show?  I have before, but I haven't watched the season yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we had the guy on and had to go to him, you know, time constraints, but it's very nice  that you can hang on. 
[02:11:00]  And you're completely naked, right?  Yes.  Now, we got new listeners every 15 or 20 minutes, so really fast.  What do you look like again?  I have blonde hair, I have blue-green eyes, I'm about 5'7", and I weigh about 135 pounds.  That's good.  Oh, very good.  Okay.  And you know how to play this game, right?  Oh, hey, dude, dude, really quick, you know, you were trashing my shirt.  Oh, hold on two seconds.  Hold on one second, Evangeline.  Because I do need to defend this, because you guys were trashing me during the break.  Yeah.  About my shirt.  I actually had a late night last night.  I did this.  I just want to thank the people.  I worked down on, there's a bar called Bar on A. It's down on 11th Street in, like, 
[02:11:30]  Avenue A, and they had me down.  It's like, you know, like a private, like, bar area.  I went down there.  They treated me unbelievably.  I told Bob and Ann, I'd give them, you know, a shout-out.  They, like, made me, like, fucking cookies.  Who does that?  It was ridiculous.  They had, like, two little batches of cookies, and they had, like, chocolate chip cake.  Who does that for comics?  And then they gave me, like, a fucking Heineken.  I'm like an Heineken.  Heineken and I'm eating brownies. 
[02:12:00]  Getting ready to go on stage.  But it was, you know, it was a great time down there.  I just wanted to give them a shout-out.  So anybody, uh...  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, people, listen.  You want to go to Cool Bar, go to Bar on A.  Tell Bob and Ann, what's up, 11th Street.  You might get cookies and Heineken.  Yeah, and Avenue A, man.  Very nice.  Bill, we're going to definitely miss you, man.  But Bill will be back very soon on the O.P. and Anthony program.  I like doing gigs like that, you know what I mean?  Just, like, not, like, comedy clubs every once in a while.  Just, like, switch it up, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  How's the reaction?  It's cool, man. 
[02:12:30]  It was kind of a weird thing because it was, like, a small bar, you know what I mean?  So literally there was people, like, on the other side of the bar who couldn't see it, but, you know...  They could hear you.  No, so they were, like, literally...  Listening to your CD.  Yeah, they were putting it on the screen.  Like, I was at Giant Stadium, but I'm just in this bar that's, like...  You're, like, right around the corner.  They could lean in their chair and see you, but they're watching you on the TV.  I was standing on, like, a fucking tabletop.  In fact, every time I moved the mic stand, I spilt my water.  You know what they did, too?  Because they had this big, ridiculous banner. 
[02:13:00]  Like, people kept sending me emails, like, dude, are you doing a gig in the village?  And I'm, like, yeah.  What are they advertising on the radio?  Like, dude, they have a picture of your stupid head that's literally the size of, like, the whole, like, window pane.  It's, like, you know, it was, like, six feet by, like, eight feet or whatever, you know?  Bigger than the stage you were standing on.  That's classic.  Bigger than my actual head, which is, uh...  It's an amazing feat.  Evangeline, you're still there, right?  Yep.  Completely naked, ready to play.  Guess what's in my pants? 
[02:13:30]  Yes.  Yeah, but tonight, dude, I'm actually gonna...  I'm gonna be at, uh...  I'm gonna be at a...  I think it's college up in, like, Pittsfield, so it's gonna be back to the...  Pittsfield, Mass?  You gotta go all the way up to Mass?  Yeah, it's gonna be, like, the regular...  Back to the regular shit.  You drive or you fly up there?  I drive up.  I don't know.  All next week, you got stuff to do, so...  Dude, if I go in the Merritt Parkway one more fucking time...  Dude, do you know every single rock on the side of the road, every single...  We were doing the drive back and forth when we were up there, and it was just every single  pebble on the side of the road.  You're waiting for, like, all right, I'm up to this tree. 
[02:14:00]  Here's this...  I know that I only got, like, two more hours to go.  107 miles from this boulder.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's the most annoying drive.  There's nothingness.  Somehow, yeah, they just say that it's quicker than taking 95.  Yeah.  Stop it.  It's horrendous.  I always end at that friendly...  Just saying...  And by the time you get on the Mass...  By the time you get on the Mass Pike, you feel like you're close, but you're not.  You're an entire state's distance away from Boston.  Oh, and they're always digging up a lane. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, and then you feel like you're close, so now you, like, pour it on, and you're doing,  like, 90, just because I'm close, I'm almost there, and there's the state's right there  on the side.  Then you get into Boston with their wonderful design, where the 15 highways all lead into,  like, one lane.  Oh, because...  Because I'm hub.  But it's underground now.  It's underground.  Yeah, it's underground.  The hub for a major city works just as well as it did in 1714, or whenever the hub was designed.  It's so much better than a grid, where no matter where you are, you can look at a sign 
[02:15:00]  and say, ah, I need to go to this grid point.  Now, the hub, with one-way streets thrown in, and hill, nothing's better than being  on, like, Beacon, and I'm trying to get to Tremont, and I don't know, and it's one way,  and you see where you gotta go, but you're not allowed to go there.  I want to blow up the city.  I hate Boston.  I hate driving in.  Philly's a close second, though.  Philly, yeah.  We had to go to a hotel once in Philly.  Yeah.  One road was closed for a distance of, I swear to you, maybe 200 feet. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  We had to go about 20 minutes out of the way.  We had to go through Baltimore.  Yeah.  But they'll have, like, all one-way streets, and there'll be 15 of them in a row going the  same direction.  Yeah, going the same direction.  Can I have a go left again?  Yeah.  At least again.  The grid, New York.  You know, one way going this way, I'll take the next turn.  I'll go around the block.  15 in a row going left.  Keep passing Ben Franklin's house.  All right.  Where were we? 
[02:16:00]  Evangeline.  Yes.  How you doing?  Sorry.  I guess we keep getting a little sidetracked.  Ben.  Where's Ben?  Well, we're supposed to get Steve on the air real fast.  Are you in your bedroom?  Yes.  On your little bed?  Yes.  What does your bedspread look like?  Because I know a lot of girls, when they move out, when they're young and they move out,  they still have their little bedspread from their parents' house.  What is your bedspread?  I have like a sand-like bedspread. 
[02:16:30]  Like it's sand-like, you know.  This is when you need like Bobby Kelly.  Yeah.  He would be like good for this thing, you know.  Somehow the wiffle ball bat movie.  Yeah, he'd know.  Is he coming in next week?  I don't know.  Who's going to be the third Darren?  I want it to be a huge surprise.  For everybody?  Yeah, why not?  Is it because it's so good or it's so bad?  I want it to be a huge surprise.  You son of a bitch.  This is going to stink on ice.  Shut up.  I know it.  Evangeline, you getting cold yet?  Your coochie getting cold?  A little bit.  Waiting. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  We'll get to you.  For some reason, Steve is in the studio, though.  Hold on a second here.  Oh, whoa, he's circling.  Hey, Steve.  Why does sometimes he circle and waits?  I guess because there's traffic in the area.  To the right of Bill Brown.  There he goes.  There he comes.  He's found an open pod to land it.  You know what my favorite part is?  Wait.  This part.  He snaps the top of it and it turns into a suitcase.  It's the best hybrid vehicle ever, ever.  This is so well worth the money.  Hey, Steve.  What's going on on your website?  FoundryMusic.com and, of course, OpieAndAnthony.com. 
[02:17:30]  We have several new clips.  We have...  What is it?  Can I see that in front of you?  No.  Oh, well, then you're hurting me.  I can't do it.  Thank you.  Well, there it is.  All the new...  All the finalists in the Assault on the Media contest we have.  Oh, shit.  We've got to announce that winner today.  Oh, that's right.  The Assault on the Media contest for September.  Oh, wait a minute.  What's the date?  What is it?  The 30-30.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, then we've got to announce it so we can open up brand new Assault on the Media for October.  For October.  Go ahead, Steve.  So we have those three finalists from Philly, Buffalo, and Boston. 
[02:18:00]  That shining clip that hit the web yesterday?  Yes.  That is up in all of its...  The video is much better than the audio we play.  And please, on instant feedback, yes, I've seen the shining clip.  Half of the instant feedbacks today are people saying, hey, the shining clip.  Isn't that great?  You haven't seen it yet?  We got it as well.  We got it.  The second it hits the web, everybody thinks they're the first one in.  All right.  A bunch of catfight videos as well.  Those have been coming in a lot.  Catfight videos.  Women beating the hell out of each other.  Nice.  It's all about the catfights.  I got the Tara Reid drinking game. 
[02:18:30]  That was a...  It's like a card game.  You have two playing cards in front of you.  One is exposed.  One is unexposed.  You have to guess if the unexposed one is higher or lower than the one that's exposed.  And if you guess right, Tara drinks.  Ooh.  And if you guess wrong, you have to drink.  All right.  That's up there.  That's up there.  We have the video of Steve-O drunk on Adam Carolla's show.  That's really fun.  That's classic, yes.  I don't play.  I don't play.  I don't play.  I don't...  Ah!  As well as Steve-O's reading of his suicide note yesterday. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, very cool.  Very cool.  And you did a movie trailer, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted to get this in before the week ended because that is slowly, slowly coming to a  closer.  Slowly?  Or quickly.  I'm sorry.  Jesus.  Quickly coming to a closer.  Early next week, Nathaniel's going to decide the top five Opie and Anthony movie trailers.  Why Nathaniel?  Huh?  Why Nathaniel?  Well, I thought you were busy.  I can do it, too.  All right.  Steve and Nathaniel will get the top five Opie and Anthony movie trailers together and we'll  announce the winners of that. 
[02:19:30]  No prizes.  Just a cute little quick contest we're doing.  But you did your own Opie and Anthony movie trailer?  Yeah.  It's about Big A and Stalker Patty's date the other day.  Where's Evangeline?  I'm here.  Oh, okay.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, hold on two seconds.  Because we just promoted this movie trailer.  We've got to play it really fast.  You're still naked, though, right?  Yes.  All right.  Nice.  You can play with yourself or something.  We'll get to you in a minute or two.  Hold on.  Oh, okay.  Thanks.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  But first, it's...  Why is... 
[02:20:00]  Oh, hold on a second.  I don't know why that's doing that.  All right.  Here's Steve's Opie and Anthony movie trailer featuring Stalker Patty and Big A.  For years, Andrew has waited for that special someone, a woman to spend his life with.  I think it's very romantic, actually.  A soulmate.  Will you shut up?  Patty has never experienced love.  I have self-control all the time.  And is a boring dipshit.  I like doing puzzles and things from the paper, like all the crossword puzzles, the math puzzles, 
[02:20:30]  and the post.  What if someone you couldn't stand...  You have no sexuality.  ...was the only someone for you?  I think she looks very beautiful.  Witness the romance between a stammering maniac...  With chronic halitosis...  There's a slight breath problem.  And a cliche slinging bag lady.  A wild and crazy evening.  No matter what she says, after she says it, I want her killed. 
[02:21:00]  He has fun on the various wheel.  I was too big, and it wouldn't balance both of us.  Wow.  But what happens after the love is gone?  You know, I just want to be, you know, friends.  Fuck you, bitch.  Why can't we be more than friends?  I can't.  I'm sorry.  What are you doing?  No! 
[02:21:30]  When rejection sends you over the edge, the only answer is murder.  No, why not?  Freak date mumbling its way to a theater near you.  What a dream come true that would be if he chopped her up with a chainsaw.  You've got problems, Steve.  I loved it.  I like that.  I had Nathaniel cut up all the drops for that. 
[02:22:00]  And he heard it yesterday.  He said, finally, you get to kill a woman in a sweeper, and it makes sense.  That's very, very good.  Wow.  All right.  I can't get instant feedback.  Why?  I don't know.  It's been a while.  Is he going to, um...  Oh, there he goes.  Yeah.  There he goes.  Bye-bye.  There goes Steve.  Steve's got to call people and get instant feedback back.  All right.  Uh, let's go back to Evangeline and play Guess What's In My Pass. 
[02:22:30]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pass?  Place the receiver  upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pass?  It's time to guess what's in my pass.  My pass.  All right.  Evangeline from Philly. 
[02:23:00]  She's completely naked.  5'7", 135 pounds.  Sounds like she's got a very hot...  She's got a booty.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, Steve-O.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Evangeline, hold on one second.  That's E-Rock's walk-on music.  Walk-on music, obviously.  Hey, Eric, what's going on?  The O&A charity auction is just about to end.  We're under half an hour.  Oh, and then that's it.  And that's it.  It's done.  Nothing else.  Yes.  How much have we raised?  Um, we'll have a final total in about 40 minutes.  Yeah, and we'll have that total up on opiananthony.com. 
[02:23:30]  But we've got like seven or eight items left, including opiananthony's Scarface movie poster.  How much?  Autographed by the entire cast.  Obviously, Al Pacino and everybody else is going for $1,000 right now, but it only has  14 minutes left as far as bidding on it.  I wanted to bid on that.  I'm going to...  Yeah.  I think I'm going to do a last minute bid.  You're going to do a last minute bid?  Yeah, why not?  Bid in on that one?  By the way, Eric did a great, great job at the opiananthony auction.  Thank you, Eric.  No problem.  Very, very good job.  Mm-hmm.  How are you feeling? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, six glasses.  You got six glasses still on.  Yeah, it should be good by Monday, so...  Sick glasses.  All right.  What else is up for bids?  We got those X-Game t-shirts that we had signed by everybody that we had on the live broadcast.  There's about four of them up there, and one or two other little things.  I think the memo apologizing for Sex for Sam, signed by Ken Stevens, is up there as well.  It's a collector's item for a fan of the show.  Sex for Sam?  Yeah, that was the church debacle.  Oh. 
[02:24:30]  It's called Sex for Sam, because the prize was...  You know, I'll never catch up.  I'm just like, what is that?  You know what, though?  It's too many little details.  Yeah, the prize that day, for the couple that would have won, was to go to the Sam Adams  Brewery with us for a big concert and drinking beer and hanging out with Jim Cook from Sam  Adams.  So it was Sex for Sam.  There you go.  I'm sure Sam Adams, they were so happy to be involved with that promotion as they watched  the Catholic Church people dumping Sam Adams' beer out into the street after that happened. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Yikes.  That was a little much.  All right, Eric, anything else?  Also, the last playlist for any Opie and Anthony material on WNEW, written by Black Earl.  So it's the exact list of all the worst of bits.  All right.  Very good.  That's a biggie.  Once again, Eric did a great job at the auction.  Thanks, Eric.  No problem.  There he goes.  E-Rock.  We're helping.  As he walks out of the studio to walk out music.  Good stuff.  All right, Evangeline, it's time to play Guess What's in My Pants.  All right. 
[02:25:30]  Live with Philly.  We filled in the listeners to the rules.  I believe so, yes.  You ready with the phone, Evangeline?  Yes, I am.  All right.  All right, so Anthony, you want to describe what you want to hear first?  Well, we usually start with the up and down fashion.  I guess if we can hear that.  Right.  Okay.  Hold on a second.  Ben?  Ben.  We have to do the Assault on the Media contest winners.  Why do we have to do it now?  We're in the middle of this pit.  Oh, we've been teasing it forever, and it's got to get done.  God damn it. 
[02:26:00]  Your fucking timing is terrible.  I know.  Evangeline, he's the executive producer.  We've got to get this done.  For what reason?  We've got to get a press release out?  Yeah, we've got to send out a press release.  David Hinkley's going to write a big article about it.  Yeah, sweet, sweet.  It's a little difficult.  All right, Evangeline, hold on one second, okay?  Sorry.  You still naked?  Yes.  Good girl.  Very good.  You don't have to go anywhere, do you?  Nope, not yet.  All right.  Do you have nice boobs and stuff?  I think so.  All right.  Very cool.  Nice.  All right.  Hold on one second.  All right.  All right, Anthony, the assault on the media contest. 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  Boy, I don't remember who the contestants are.  Who's like, who was in the lead.  I've got to say, not a very memorable month.  Are you insane?  What?  Maybe I'm not, maybe I'm forgetting.  What was involved this month?  There was the guys in Boston and Beacon Hill that ran up behind the reporter.  And then one of the guys got tackled live on TV.  The horn, okay.  And then there was the Philly guys.  The Philly guys at the Eagles game.  Look, I'm an asshole. 
[02:27:00]  I shouldn't have said that.  The Philly guys came up with a brand new way to assault the media.  They actually jumped in front of the reporter.  Yes.  We don't see a lot of people jumping in front of the reporter.  There's no way the cameraman could defend.  Yeah, they had the balls to jump in front of the reporter.  They had wow stickers on their entire body, screaming, yelling.  And that was really good.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I was actually, my asshole was just talking.  I was talking right out of my asshole.  And then you had Buffalo Paul.  It's between Buffalo, Philly, and Boston.  But we don't want you guys to vote because of what city you live in. 
[02:27:30]  You've got to just vote for the best assault on the media.  What was the Buffalo one about, Ben?  That was the guy that ran up behind the reporter with a mask on.  He had a cutout of Jim's face with like a cigar in it.  Oh, it was very scary and scared the reporter.  And she ran off the camera.  Yeah, she ran out of camera view.  She ran away and just bailed on her report.  That was a good one.  That was a really good one.  And that also involved a little air horn.  Yeah.  And had a crazy, crazy mask.  Philly was the guys at the Eagles game. 
[02:28:00]  And they ran right in front.  They rang the air horn.  And they said, good luck, bro.  And those guys, one guy was covered in wow stickers.  Had a bunch of tools.  I love them.  I love them.  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  And then the guys in Boston.  And the guys in Boston.  All the videos are up on opiananthony.com.  You want to explain the assault on the media contest, Anthony?  Because we started up for October.  We got new listeners every week.  This is easy, man.  You see a live shot going on.  That's your local news people with their camera crew, their satellite truck, doing a stand-up, 
[02:28:30]  they call it.  Maybe there was a shooting at a deli.  And she's out in front.  And the anchor people toss it to them.  And they go, I'm here live in front of blah, blah, blah.  Your mission is to get into that shot, get behind the reporter, and hold up some type of sign that says opiananthony,  XM Satellite Radio, Channel 202, ONA Party Rock, just any kind of opiananthony-related sign and make kind of a ruckus. 
[02:29:00]  You don't touch the reporter or anything, but you try to get your camera time.  Because if the camera's there, the reporter's there, and I'm there, isn't it really our time?  Yes, it is.  Get behind the reporter or in front of it and get that sign-up in there.  And the best one, which it seems to be the best ones are the most disruptive ones.  Look at the Boston one.  I'm looking at the Boston one.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  There's a big thing going on.  They tackle, like, not tackle, but they grab one guy that was attempting an assault to the media, 
[02:29:30]  and that allowed another guy that was with their posse to run toward the reporter.  Two-prong attack, that one.  Look, they're walking down, and they're using, like, just regular pedestrians.  They're hiding behind the pedestrians.  They're walking down the sidewalk behind the reporter.  And then they strike.  And the pest is behind the pedestrians.  The security guy tried to get them both back.  He grabbed one guy, and the second guy broke through and got right behind the reporter with a wow sticker.  Yeah, he was much more subtle with the bumper sticker.  Yeah, just the bumper sticker.  The other guy had a big sign.  So, basically...  It's like the beginning of Reservoir Dogs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:30:00]  Just come walking up.  Yeah, we're watching all the videos in studio right now.  Basically, we don't want you to harm the reporter.  Oh, he really shoved him, didn't he?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  Oh, no, the guy who got shoved, actually, he comes back.  Yeah, because he shoved him, but then he went for the guy with the sign,  and the guy that he shoved came right back.  Like a ballsy move.  Like Barry Sanders.  Bounced off a tackler, brought it across the goal line.  He shook him and just kept running.  You can pretty much do anything except touch the reporter or harm the reporter. 
[02:30:30]  Shoves him.  Now he goes for the sign guy.  And look at that.  He cuts to the left.  Okay.  And he's back in the shot.  Oh, I see.  All right.  The one guy was trying to take out the two guys.  That's your instinct.  He can't teach that.  No, you can't.  That was a really good instinct.  Really, a well-trained pest.  Very good.  So, yeah, don't touch the reporter if you're going to get involved in the contest for October.  We do this contest every month.  Uh-huh.  And now that this is the season for satellite radio,  we're expecting some very, very big assaults on the media.  And we're looking for creativity.  And more importantly, we're looking to get the name of the show out there. 
[02:31:00]  The exposure, exactly.  On live TV.  So, if you get a combination of good creativity and getting the name out, you know,  you're in a good position to win the Assault on the Media contest.  For the month of September, up for grab.  This is a portable Delphi MiFi radio.  A dinner with E-Rock at Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  30 days free video game rental from Gamefly.com.  And finally, admission to just check out our show one day if you're in the New York area.  All right.  And October, hopefully the prizes will be even better as this contest continues. 
[02:31:30]  All right, Anthony.  So, the videos are up on OpieAndAnthony.com.  But what we did, we had the whole staff vote on their favorite.  Their favorite assault on the media for the month of September.  Well, I was looking at the star-studded panel of voters here.  Wow.  Members of the Academy.  Oh, yeah.  Celebrity judges all over the place.  You know, me and Opie not even involved in the vote. 
[02:32:00]  My God.  Not even involved because they just went way over our heads.  As a cream of the crop.  The people that can really identify talent.  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead, Anthony.  For the voters.  Voting on this.  Master Poe.  E-Rock.  Travis, Steve, Mars, Danny, Nathaniel.  Bill, the intern, was involved in the voting process.  Bill, the intern.  Is Bill here today?  Yeah.  Bill's here.  He showed up a little late. 
[02:32:30]  Derek and Ben.  Let's find out why Bill was late, by the way.  All right.  Yeah, I'm sure it's an interesting story.  Bill, the intern.  Late because this guy is like Johnny on the spot.  Evangeline.  Yeah.  We're almost to you.  Almost.  Hang in there, all right?  We've just got to get past this little bit.  They teach you in radio.  You've got to do one thing at a time, so just bear with us.  Okay.  I mean, you're the star of the show today, obviously.  And speaking of bear, you're...  She's bear as we speak on the bed.  There you go.  On the bed, right?  Are you starting to moan a little bit?  No. 
[02:33:00]  No.  You guys are killing me.  You got posters on your wall?  No, I don't have posters.  No?  No.  You got anything made by grandma in your room?  Do you have bed sores at this point?  No.  No, nothing by grandma.  Nothing?  Wow, your room sounds dull.  Why?  Because I don't have stuff from my grandma.  I tell you what I like.  A girl that just kind of moved out.  How long have you been out of your parents' house?  Since college.  And how many years?  So that's five years now.  Oh, five years?  All right.  I like a girl that just moves out that has maybe a Smurf bedspread. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Posters of boy bands on the wall.  Stuff that you would have.  Fluffing pillows.  I'm the exact opposite.  I come...  You hook up with a chick and she's got like four stuffed animals on the bed.  Yeah.  And she starts on, this one's called Pookie.  Your fucking dick is just like, all right, dude, I'm out of here.  This is just nuts.  You got stuffed animals?  Um, not on my bed.  But you have stuffed animals.  Yeah, I have some leftover from when I was a kid.  Yeah, when you were a kid. 
[02:34:00]  What are they?  A frog?  No.  What?  I have a giant dog, a little lion thing, and this dolphin.  What's the dog's name?  Oh, I don't know.  You have a name.  Stop it.  What's the dog's name?  I didn't name it.  That's actually...  I got that from my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and I didn't name it.  Which one does have a name?  He threw a dart at a balloon at a carnival.  There you go, sweetheart.  Eh, I love you.  Gives you a rash when you're holding it. 
[02:34:30]  The dolphin has a name, doesn't it?  No, none of them domes are.  I'm a liar.  Those awful carnival stuffed animals that look like they have some sort of aneurysm.  They got the bad stitching and the stuffing's pushing through.  Yeah, the stitching's never good.  It's like...  And then they just...  They stop making things with legs.  It's like you want a worm.  And so they could just have a tube with one seam on it.  Oh, that ball with the fucking eyes as they just...  Those prizes.  Thanks.  One of the eyes is just slightly off, always.  All right, hold on, Evangeline. 
[02:35:00]  We got Bill the intern in here.  We're going to get to you, though.  All right, hold on.  Yeah.  You don't have names for your stuffed animals, huh?  Come on.  No, I don't.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You know it.  No?  All right, hold on the line, okay?  Evangeline, completely naked in Philly, getting ready to play.  Guess what's in my pants.  Hello, Bill.  Intern Bill, why are you late today?  Hey, guys.  No, I just...  Certainly wasn't spending time looking for a shirt, was it?  No, I was...  That, at my count right now, and this is just that I have seen, 
[02:35:30]  maybe the fourth appearance of the Charles Bronson shirt.  Yeah, I slept in it last night, basically.  I was going to ask him where he got it, actually.  It is a cool shirt, isn't it?  Charles Bronson.  The first three times it's cool.  Right.  After that, it's like, this nut with the Charles Bronson shirt.  Let's knock it off already.  Why did you sleep?  I didn't sleep.  I basically...  It was someone's birthday last night, and I went, and I was drinking, and...  Of course you were.  At 3 a.m., I get back, and I start walking back from the bar,  and I get back about 3 a.m., and, you know, all my alarms are set to go. 
[02:36:00]  All?  How many?  Three.  Three alarms are set.  And I...  It was pretty bad, and I just passed out on the floor.  But I thought, like, the alarms would have woke me up, and all three of them must have  went off.  And when I got the call from someone called me, I freaked out, and I just gunned it to  the train station as fast as I could.  Yeah.  Yeah, this...  Yeah, I feel really terrible about this.  Like, this is gonna...  I'm gonna obsess over this.  Well, if you were one of those really bad interns, that would have been bad, but, you 
[02:36:30]  know, you're pretty...  What do you do when you obsess about something?  I just play it through my mind over and over, and I'll be like, oh...  Kill chipmunks and stuff?  Yeah, you feel like I need to just choke a random stranger walking down the street?  Fish for pigeons and little black girls, you know...  Cobblestone over some random person's family.  Wait, what'd you say?  What'd you say?  What'd I say?  Something about pigeons and black girls?  It's a weird combination.  Don't strangle Bill's shirt. 
[02:37:00]  He's gonna kick you in the chest.  With a steel-toed boot.  Titty twister.  So this, like, freaks you out like you fucked up and you don't like fucking up a gig like  this.  No, I just feel terrible about it.  Why did you stay out so late?  Three in the morning, you know what?  It was like 10 p.m. and...  It's three in the fucking morning!  And my friend's like, hey, it's this friend's birthday and I haven't been hanging around  my friends that much this semester.  And they're like, come on, come on.  I'm like, dude, I'll only go if we'll be back guaranteed by 1 a.m.  And they said yes. 
[02:37:30]  And when we didn't leave at 1, I'm like, I gotta fucking go.  And I started running the four miles it is to my house.  You ran four miles.  Well, yeah, I got about halfway and I still had my drink in my hand, running and drinking.  And someone in a cab offered me a ride to the fucking place and I had no idea.  And then my friends came in another cab and they picked me up and brought me back.  The way you were home and they came and got you and brought you back to the party.  No, no, no.  They found me in a cab running towards the apartment, which is two towns over or whatever 
[02:38:00]  it is.  Because I was in White Plains or, yeah, I think I was in White Plains and we live in  Port Chester.  Yeah.  So I was running like Lincoln Avenue and down and past the Hutchinson River Parkway.  Why didn't you just take the cab the whole way to your house?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  There was no cab outside the bar.  So I was just.  At some point you were in a cab and then they dropped you off.  That's when they got me.  They picked, they found me.  And when I left, that's when they knew they had to leave and find me.  Oh, so they were in a cab. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, and they came and picked me up.  So he saw the cab and the cab he saw was full of his friends and they got you and drove  you back.  Yeah, to the house.  Oh, to the house.  I kind of, I guess they were drinking or whatever and when I left, they're like, where the fuck  is he going?  And then they figured it out and went and got me and then brought me back.  Wow.  So I wasn't going to say, I couldn't go on any longer.  I knew I needed to get to bed and.  Yeah.  Do you hurt people?  No, no.  Okay.  All been wondering that.  Maybe emotionally, but never physically.  Never physically?  Yeah.  You hurt my feelings. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, you just chip away at them and.  Bill made a very good observation in the office about you.  About who?  Oh.  Yeah.  Those two bills in the studio.  You ever see the movie Stripes?  Yes.  Remember that dude, Psycho?  That's right.  That's what you remind me of.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Does that fit?  The name's Francis Sawyer.  But everybody calls me Psycho.  Any of you guys call me Francis and I'll kill you.  And I don't like nobody touching my stuff. 
[02:39:30]  So just keep your meat hooks off.  If I catch any of you guys in my stuff, I'll kill you.  Also, I don't like nobody touching me.  Now, any of you homos touch me and I'll kill you.  Lighten up, Francis.  It's kind of similar how they talk.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You made that observation and you guys already got that drop that quickly?  Yeah, that's the beauty of what we do.  The magic of radio.  We just make believe that was off the cuff.  Uh-huh.  It was planned, I don't know, at least two days ago.  Yeah.  Thanks for destroying the magic. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Thanks for tearing down the eighth wall.  You're welcome.  In this octagon we work in.  Don't you ever touch me again.  He's like, I know how this radio shit works.  That was pitched in a meeting.  So anyway.  He got some clips.  Where were we?  The assault on the media contest.  Yes.  The voting.  And Bill was one of the.  Bill, the intern, was one of the voters.  Yeah.  You could just put those down right there, Bill. 
[02:40:30]  Who'd you vote for, Bill?  Uh, the guys in Philly.  The guys in Philly.  You could vote for the Philly ones.  Why did you like that one?  Because they got in front of the camera.  And they looked like they would have just like pounded away at anyone who tried to stop  them from what they were doing.  And they were very aggressive.  Psychos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  Why don't you go out and look for a James Coburn shirt that you can wear in between that.  That one.  Lee Marvin.  Lee Marvin.  Tank top.  Thanks, fellas. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  No problem, my friend.  Very nice.  Lee Marvin.  All right.  So we had everyone vote.  I don't know who Master Poe voted for, Ben.  Gentlemen.  It says second place is video number two.  What does that mean?  Video number two was Boston.  Was Boston?  Or Buffalo, I think.  I would say.  It went in order.  It went Boston, Buffalo, and Philly.  How I lined the clubs.  I'm looking here and seeing that one place just got one vote for second place. 
[02:41:30]  And I'm thinking that's the one Poe voted for.  Well, here we go.  I would think Poe would like the guy who made the defensive move.  Right.  On the attacker.  Who would all be analyzed.  You know, this guy's coming in.  I like the way he shoved them off.  It's very good, gentlemen.  All right.  How about we do this?  There he comes.  Mr. Poe, who did you vote for?  Poe, part of the voting?  Poe, Poe.  You know where the mics are?  There you go.  Who did you vote for?  The third video.  What the fuck does that mean? 
[02:42:00]  Well, the email that was given to me by Ben, there was three videos.  What was in the video?  The two guys, two gorillas, jumped in front of the news reporter.  And the one guy had stickers all over his body.  And he was screaming, Opie and Anthony.  That's the one from Philly.  Every article of clothing he owns has some sort of emblem that says,  I can kick the shit out of you.  I will just kill you.  Yeah.  Cobra Kai.  Cobra Kai.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to need a body bag. 
[02:42:30]  Kick his ass.  Well, it's just a sword and a shield.  Sweep the leg.  Yes.  I want you to sweep the leg.  But, Sensei, I'll be disqualified.  He's got nunchucks.  All right.  So, Bill the intern and nunchucks on the tag of his underwear.  Both like the Philly assault on the media.  Very good.  All right.  Good one.  Thank you, Paul.  Thank you, guys.  How about we do this?  In third place, we'll just play the audio of third place.  Third place. 
[02:43:00]  This is third place.  Assault on the media contest for September.  Finally down to the nuts and bolts of this damn thing.  As voted by our illustrious voting staff.  That's right.  Here is third place.  Southern News reporter Julie Fine is live at Erie Community College tonight with the very latest for us.  Julie?  It was quite a scene here.  State Assemblyman Mark Schroeder calling a news conference.  He is critical of the control board's consultant fee.  We'll have to get right back to you with this story.  Yes.  That's right. 
[02:43:30]  Falling short for, I think, the third month in a row.  Much like his football team.  Buffalo Paul and chicken shit.  Oh, he just missed the uprights on the show.  That one, didn't he?  He just missed once again.  Damn.  Third place goes to Buffalo Paul and chicken shit.  Ouch.  I was very surprised.  I thought they were going to either win it finally or come in second place.  I never thought third place.  The Giants win by one.  It was Nathaniel, right?  Poor bastard.  Nathaniel's voter. 
[02:44:00]  I thought it did.  My only problem with the Philly one is it's a bunch of wow stickers moving around the frame.  You're not sure what they're promoting.  He had that t-shirt on.  It had some good air time.  I like Nathaniel's assessment of that one.  The one with the stickers is kind of just stickers.  You got a lot of them.  We're all over them, but, yeah, kind of just stickers.  I like the one big hoof in your face.  Yeah, the big Opie and Anthony.  Bam!  That horn was pretty good.  That really threw her for a loop, if I may say.  That's actually a good idea.  You scare the shit out of the reporter. 
[02:44:30]  They clear out.  You got a nice camera shot.  Now you can finish her story if you want.  Do whatever you want to do.  Yeah.  Just frighten them out of the scene.  Want to play runner-up?  Runner-up.  That'll be obvious who won, but runner-up for the Assault on the Media Contest for the month of September.  Here's the audio.  Let's get a look at the early tailgating.  Oh, Amy, they're already out here.  Tailgating season is here.  Pre-game revelry.  Oh, absolutely.  I knew the tailgaters would be out here earlier this morning, and they are out here in full force in the parking lot by Lincoln Financial. 
[02:45:00]  As you can see.  Do it, do it.  Come on, bro.  Thank you.  Okay.  Totally disrupted the report the lady was trying to do at the Eagles game.  It's Philly in the runner-up position.  But what's great about that is she actually thinks that football fans are going crazy, so they've got an extra couple of seconds.  Right.  They're already getting crazy out here.  And that's kind of why I don't like that one. 
[02:45:30]  I really like the photo one.  It's because it's in an atmosphere where you can get away with doing that because it's tailgating.  Isn't that just a smart form of attack?  Everyone's crazy.  It is, right.  They don't expect it there.  They had creativity with the stickers, though, and jumping in front of the reporter.  Yeah, that is the Trojan horse.  Yeah, the air horn.  The Trojan horse.  Well, Philly got three first-posts.  They kind of rode in on a tailgating party.  It's a gift.  Opened it up and attacked.  Philly got three first-place votes.  Buffalo got one second-place vote. 
[02:46:00]  That was it.  They didn't mean...  Oh, no, Nathaniel got one voted for Buffalo, right?  Yeah, there was only one total vote for Buffalo.  And we've got to congratulate Sonny Ferrelli and the Boston Strangler.  I don't have a drum roll.  I don't have a timpani.  I don't have anything.  They are the winners of the Assault in the Media contest for September.  The video is absolutely great with the guy running out of the truck and trying to prevent the assault from happening.  But that guy failed miserably.  And our winner is...  That's it. 
[02:46:30]  Here's the audio.  I don't know if it'll make sense, but all the videos will be up on opianthony.com with the place they came in.  But here's Sonny Ferrelli and Boston Strangler.  Yes, we're very happy to say that.  But, you know, David, it is coming.  And I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  But, folks, remember these, the good old shovel and broom.  Well, we're going to have to get real familiar with these.  Because if you don't clean your car off of a gun...  That is great.  No, that one deserves to win. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, there is.  They're yelling.  They disrupted her.  They broke through a tackle.  It had a huge sign, a sticker.  It had all the features.  It had all the features.  All right.  Once again.  Definitely worthy of first place.  Sonny Ferrelli and Boston Strangler.  Yeah, bravo, guys.  The Assault on the Media Contest for September is officially over.  We start with October immediately.  Immediately.  Immediately.  We'll have a list of prizes that will be up for grabs.  All right?  Bring it on.  It happens in any city.  You see these live shots.  All right.  Finally, Evangeline from Philly. 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  Hi, Evangeline.  How are you doing?  Sorry about that.  Yeah, we've got to apologize.  This show, it's like a train.  It just keeps chugging, and we, yeah.  Anyway.  You're a fan of the show, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So you understand that we go off on these crazy tangents.  It sucks.  Oh, I know.  I really apologize, man.  A hot girl like you sitting there all naked.  Did she give her breast size?  I think it was, I'm going to guess your breast size.  Oh, I hope he's going to guess by looking. 
[02:48:00]  36, full B, maybe C.  I'm a 34, but yeah, I'm a full B.  34, full B.  All right.  You were giving her a little too much back there, Opie.  Come on.  That's all right.  34, full B with the booty?  Yeah, that's nice.  With the big.  With the booty?  Big, cute.  Is it really big, your ass, or like freakish?  Like where they're walking down, and you can't help but look.  I've looked at some bad asses longer than I've looked at hot asses, because they just baffle  me sometimes. 
[02:48:30]  No, I've been complimented by people just walking by, so I don't think it's one of those bad  asses.  Why didn't you say it?  Black people, right?  Well.  Black guys love that ass on you.  Yeah, they do love my ass.  Blonde hair with the big booty.  Nice.  Can we do the ass test?  Future NBA wife.  Right.  Can we do the ass test?  No one's looking.  What's the ass test, Opie?  She puts the phone down there and gives it a spank.  Oh, could you smack your ass with the phone?  So we could hear the wave motion?  All right. 
[02:49:00]  Let's hear.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, yeah.  That's solid.  Yeah, there's some going on there.  Yeah.  Could you hit a little harder?  On my side?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Tell your roommate.  And get the phone closed, because we can tell a lot from the sound.  Yeah, hit your ass.  All right.  Wow, that was very solid.  There wasn't much struggle there at all.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  You're pretty solid for a girl with a big ass.  What part did you do? 
[02:49:30]  The side of my butt.  Yeah.  But did you tighten it all up, or...  No.  All right.  You left it loose?  One more test.  No, because when the girl...  It's probably her forehead.  When the girl's on...  That's very funny.  I think she's cheating, though.  Why?  Because I think every girl, when they're kind of like bent over and then reaching and slapping  their butt, everything's nice and tight.  Oh, did you bend over?  Well, I'm trying to reach around to get it. 
[02:50:00]  Can you lay down on your belly on your bed?  No, I want her to stand up.  Stand up?  Yeah, stand up.  Okay.  And do the same slap.  I want to see if there's a difference, because it's a solid, solid hit.  That means there's not much movement there.  And not around the side.  You've got to kind of reach around and get, like, dead center on an ass cheek.  There you go.  Okay.  All right, here we go.  You're standing up?  Yeah.  All right.  Ah, see?  That didn't sound...  There was a little movement.  A little movement.  A little bit more.  That's nice.  You need something to hold on to.  That's nice.  Bill, did you hear the little movement there? 
[02:50:30]  She has a phenomenal ass.  Phenomenal.  It sounded, though, a little less tight than the other thing.  What do you mean, Ant?  Well, the side, because I think when it was bent over a little bit, it was very tight.  But this is like, you ever tune a drum?  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  You know, you take the drum key and kind of tune it down.  It sounded a little tuned down.  One more time.  I want to hear that.  On the ass cheek, standing up.  Do the other ass cheek.  Other ass cheek.  Just so you're symmetrical, all right? 
[02:51:00]  Okay.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  I hear it.  You hear it?  I hear it.  That was more of a fleshy kind of moving sound.  The sound of cottage cheese.  What do you want to ask?  No.  That was wonderful.  I liked that.  Okay.  Yeah.  Nice transition from ass to thigh.  No dimpling going on there?  No dimpling.  All right, you wacky bastard.  Get back on the bed so we can play Guess What's in My Pants.  Okay. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  Derek, why don't you play the song there?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver.  Help on your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess.  What's in my pants? 
[02:52:00]  My pants.  All right.  We're ready to play finally.  Okay.  All right.  You know what to do, right?  Yeah.  Up and down first.  Yes.  Listen, guys, Chuck Farnham is calling in on the hotline.  We've got to get right to him.  Chuck Farnham, our friend from California.  He's one of these real sicko guys.  Loves serial killing.  Loves collecting things from serial killers.  Hey, Chuck.  What's going on?  Hello, guys.  Geez, I kind of wanted to hear that myself.  Yeah.  We're going to have to wait a little while, though, because we've got another call coming 
[02:52:30]  in on the hotline, perhaps, in a little while.  Also, we've got to get through all this stuff.  A lot of material today.  A lot of material.  Busy, busy.  So what's going on, Chuck?  September 30th, 1955.  Yeah?  1955.  55.  That's the 50th anniversary of something.  Let me think.  Yes, it is.  Let me think.  Listen, Doug.  September 30th, 1955.  No, it wasn't my prom date. 
[02:53:00]  The last time the Milwaukee Brewers were 500?  The death of James Dean.  Ah.  Yes.  Oh, ah.  Very big story.  So I'm down here about, well, I guess I'm about three and a half hours from San Francisco.  Yes.  At the intersection of Highway 41 and 46.  And it's going to be an all-day affair down here.  What?  It's a big thing?  Oh, God. 
[02:53:30]  Every year, all the nuts come out.  Swear they see his ghost walking up and down the street.  Brother.  Women crying in poodle skirts.  A few years ago, I brought a woman down who carried the ashes of her cousin.  Yeah.  And poured them in the middle of the street where the accident happened.  Why is this fascinating to people?  I have no idea.  They're, like, obsessed with it down there.  I mean, they come from hundreds of miles away.  It's a huge, huge event.  Do people go to, like, where River Phoenix dropped dead and do that every year? 
[02:54:00]  I have.  You have?  Yeah.  But is that something that people, like, do?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, Chuck does all this weird shit.  Yeah, so I got the WOW stickers.  Okay.  Oh.  And they just renamed the highway or the intersection there, the James Dean intersection.  So I figured I'd plaster those up on the old side for you.  Why would they name it after the guy that's, like, croaked at the intersection?  Oh, that's a little weird. 
[02:54:30]  Well, out of respect.  Where's the actual crash?  Right in the middle of the road?  Yeah, it's right in the middle of the road.  He didn't hit a tree, right?  He hit another car or something?  Well, the deal is, it's like, people go, I don't know how the guy died.  At this time of year down here, it happened at 5 o'clock in the evening.  He was coming straight down a road, and this guy's in a pickup truck.  By the way, the guy's name is Don Turnipseed.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, weird name, huh?  He never saw the guy.  Dean apparently said to the guy who was in the car with him, that guy isn't going to pull out. 
[02:55:00]  And in reality, you can't see a thing up that road with the sun where it is at that time of day.  The guy never saw him.  Total both cars.  Matter of fact, I got pictures of the cars on the website this morning.  There was somebody in the car with James Dean?  Yeah.  Yeah, he got thrown clear.  Rolf is a mechanic.  I didn't know that.  He was in the hospital for months.  Dean died of a broken neck.  Eek.  Fascinating.  Are they wearing their seatbelts? 
[02:55:30]  I think not.  1955?  Nah, you didn't need to smoke and cigarettes.  They had those awful ones that just went across your lap.  Yeah, so you could just break in half.  Yes, your torso keeps going into the dashboards.  That friggin' wooden stake of a steering wheel thing.  Like, they didn't think of collapsible steering wheel columns or anything.  This goes right through your heart.  In fact, when cars were made of quality, things all metal.  Cigarette lighter goes through your eye.  I remember driving around when I was a kid with my father in, like, an old Rambler, whatever the hell kind of crap car it was, in the passenger seat. 
[02:56:00]  And it was one of those big bench seats, you know, that just go all the way across.  And the dashboard was metal.  The dashboard itself, where the glove compartment was and everything was metal.  And I wasn't wearing a seatbelt.  I'm a kid.  I'm sitting in the front seat.  And when he'd jam on the brakes, he would just put his arm out to try to, like, stop me.  Not knowing any type of physics that, like, the weight of me and his arm and the way his arm bends.  The fact that you're all moving forward. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, if it was any more than just a little tap on the brake, my face, my teeth, right into the metal dashboard.  They sure figured that shit out slowly.  Why don't we pad the dashboard so when people eat it, it's not quite eating steel.  And it wasn't like that lunchbox metal either.  No.  No, my, my, uh, Pittsburgh steel.  An I-beam right across there.  A girder.  A girder with a glove box.  What are you trying to accomplish on the 50th anniversary of James Dean's death down there? 
[02:57:00]  I'd just like to hang out with weirdos.  You know what?  I went to, uh, that place where JFK got shot there.  Dealey Plaza.  And, uh, that's, uh, one of the most famous spots in all of the world.  Yeah.  And within five minutes, I was bored shitless.  I was like, oh, oh, oh.  Once you see it, it's over.  Gressy Knoll, right there, there's the exit in the road where it happened, and there's the book thing, and the trip.  All right, I got it.  And then I was like, hey, uh, is there a Starbucks around here? 
[02:57:30]  Like, what are you going to do there all day?  My brother tried to tell me that there was actually a tour where you could get in, like, a 1963, uh, Lincoln Continental.  And drive the road.  And drive, and they play all the audio.  And here's a motorcade coming around the corner.  Sick bastards.  I'm sure.  I'm sure that, uh, happened, so.  And then people run out onto the X to get their pictures taken exactly where JFK was.  Yeah, they painted an X in the street.  And then the light changes.  It's now green.  And these cars, you know, they're Dallas.  They don't give a fuck about this site.  They just, they just know they have to take this way to get home. 
[02:58:00]  So they're just flying where JFK, you know, made his way.  And they're, I watched a bunch of people almost got hit.  Because they're, they're clueless tourists.  Like, oh, take my picture.  What a hilarious tourist attraction.  It's not the Statue of Liberty, the Liberty Bell, or like, cheers in Boston.  But they have to run out.  The president's brains got blown up.  They have to run out in the middle of the road to get their picture taken.  And I was down there with Jimmy Norton and a couple of my brothers.  And, you know, we all took our pictures on the X. 
[02:58:30]  Of course they did.  Well, at least we were smarter, making sure that it was a red light, you know.  Anyway.  Oh.  So, Chuck, that's about it?  Yeah, we'll be sending some photos your way over the weekend.  Ah, I can't wait.  Great, man.  Can't wait for the photos.  Yeah, it'll be good.  I'm telling you.  Hey, Evangeline.  Yeah.  We were ready to play Guess What's in My Pants.  I know we stalled a little bit because we have a lot going on.  Yeah.  But we have a big star on the hotline we have to get to.  Danny Bonaduce. 
[02:59:00]  You know Danny, right?  Are you watching the show?  Not right now.  Why not?  Because you say not to listen to it when you're talking.  Oh, no, not this show.  I mean, are you watching Danny Bonaduce?  No.  Why not?  Because.  All right, hold on.  We'll get to you.  Please hold.  You're still naked, though, right?  Yes.  Great.  All right, hold on.  We'll get to you in a minute there.  Let's say hi to Danny Bonaduce.  Danny.  Danny, what's up, man?  How are you, sir?  I'm good, man. 
[02:59:30]  How are you?  Great.  Although, I've got to tell you, I'm the tiniest bit surprised.  Why is that?  Well, because you guys are like, you know, legends in my business.  I'm a morning jock, as you know.  And you guys are like probably one of the biggest names in radio.  And I'm listening, and I'm hearing about how dangerous the dashboard of a car is.  Let me jump in with my life.  So one day, I'm sleeping with Johnny Thunder's wife.  My girlfriend comes home and shoots me in the chest.  Now, that's the night out. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, I know.  We live the pussy lifestyle, man.  Compared to what the hell you've been doing, we are just faggots.  He lives a Behind the Music episode every day.  Every day.  Every day.  And I'm sitting here.  The dashboards were very dangerous.  I was almost injured once in a short stop.  What an ass.  I swear to God, if it wasn't for me and maybe Susan Day being a puker, they'd have had nothing. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, I saw that one, the Partridge Family Behind the Music.  Yeah, they tried to make Susan Day seem like she really had bulimia bad, I guess.  Yeah, but before they named it, like she's the poster child of this stuff.  Because she's way back when it was called throwing up.  Yeah.  And that was kind of back when that was the look anyway.  Exactly.  Everyone loved a nice skinny broad back then.  Everyone was trying to look like Karen Carpenter back then.  Yeah, Karen Carpenter, that was a little too far.  Yeah, there you go. 
[03:01:00]  Danny, we're loving the show.  I don't know what to think of it, though, man.  You're crazy.  Yeah, that seems to be the going concern these days.  My only concern about that is, I mean, I can't say they edited me crazy.  What I just, that's the way I am.  That's how I behave.  There's no way out.  What I can say is, I was really, really, really crazy on Monday.  And then really, really crazy on Friday.  And when they're done editing, I'm crazy all day.  The entire week.  That's reality. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you probably had a couple of nice, normal days in there, right?  I did nice days with the kids.  I like my pants.  I was going to say I mowed the lawn, but I didn't mow the lawn.  Were you ever in the middle of losing your shit and you're just thinking, okay, this is making the show?  Yes, to be honest, to be honest with you, I was, but that was kind of the problem where I started to think of this is really crazy, that there might be something seriously wrong with me.  Yeah.  Because I'd be going so far.  And in my head, I'm thinking, wow, this is probably going to be really interesting. 
[03:02:00]  But then it would go so far in my head, I would think, hey, you have to stop this.  And I couldn't.  People are going to be watching this, for God's sake.  I'm kind of bummed because we have you on live, so obviously you're okay by the end of the show.  Well.  I was watching every week convinced that, you know, we were going to get the headline.  You know what, man?  I swear to God, so was I.  I talked so well.  I don't know if they'll air this or not.  Yeah.  Because we have some legal issues, right? 
[03:02:30]  Not everything went according to plan.  And, you know, I was chock full of Vicodin and vodka and steroids.  Not a great meal.  You know, especially if I got a questionable anger management problem to begin with.  So there's some people that might be suing.  But anyway, there's a game I invented when I was homeless, and it's called Shoot, Bitch.  And what you do is you find the guy with the gun who thinks he's really bad, and you piss him off, and he draws his gun, and you look at him and you go, shoot, bitch. 
[03:03:00]  And then they never do.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's a little suicidal.  No, that's not.  No?  Because I don't really believe they won't do it.  It would be suicidal if I thought, man, if I say this, this guy is going to shoot me.  But, you know, the public places and stuff, they're never going to shoot.  Wow.  Now, obviously, it was the drugs that got you homeless.  You're spending money on drugs instead of the roof over the head. 
[03:03:30]  You mean back when I was homeless when I was, like, 19?  Yeah.  No, everybody thinks I was like this big crack whore, and that came later.  The Partridge family, the last year, the big money, $600 a week.  $600 a week.  Yeah, it wasn't bad money for 1975 or whatever it was.  No.  Well, when I turned 18 to get all this money, it was $72,000.  And I made a conscious decision.  I said to myself, well, I can either try and eat this out into some kind of lifestyle for a little while, 
[03:04:00]  or I can have the most outrageous 30 days ever.  That's what I went with.  God damn.  Oh, we're talking to another rock star.  Jesus.  We bitch about how our rock stars are gone, man, but this is, you're a rock star.  Well, thank you, man.  I'm 46 years old, so I feel like, you know, Eugenus Joplin is one of my heroes, right?  Dead at 27. 
[03:04:30]  Now, Britney Spears is going to live forever.  That's just so inappropriate.  What happened to rock stars dying and choking on their own vomit like they're supposed to?  Hallelujah, brother.  We were just talking about, we were at OzFest a couple years back,  and all these tough-looking bands were eating, like, vegetarian meals and drinking water  and whining and complaining as they're all tatted up,  and I was looking like, man, I've been backstage for many, many years.  I'm like, what happened to the rock star?  Where's the waking up with the needle in your arm, clinically dead?  Right.  All that shit. 
[03:05:00]  Hey, I want you to know, that's the line to beat on Behind the Music.  Yeah.  Mickey Sixx saying, and that's when I woke up with the needle still in my arm.  Yeah.  With the blood.  The line to beat, man.  Yeah.  And people are not really trying to beat that right now.  Although Danny's coming close.  Danny's going to give it a try.  He's going to give it a shot.  So, that's really you doing steroids on the show?  Yeah.  For the first episode, I didn't know what, I'll tell you guys the absolute truth.  Here's what happened.  We sold VH1 one show, a very cute little show called Rock and Roll Dinner Party, 
[03:05:30]  and I got the idea, because it said Mick Jagger drove up to a nightclub,  and I thought, who the hell taught Mick Jagger to drive?  I never thought about Mick Jagger behind the wheel of a car.  Right.  He goes in limousines and all those voices.  I wonder what else he does.  I wonder, if I had him over to my house, would he play Pictionary?  You know, what do these rock stars do?  So, we sold them this cute little show, and then that kind of,  they didn't like that so much, but they thought the Bonaduchis were interesting. 
[03:06:00]  So, my wife started setting up these cute little things for her to do,  like her 39th and a half birthday party, because she was never going to turn 40,  stuff like that, right?  Yeah.  And I said, just send the cameras to my house, and I'll be fascinating, trust me.  So, they sent the cameras to my house, and I'm just sitting there like a retard, doing nothing.  So, I said, excuse me for a minute, and I went to my local bar, and I started drinking,  thinking, what can I do, what can I do, what can I do, what can I do?  And by the time I realized I had no ideas, I was wasted. 
[03:06:30]  And I came back to my house, and I'm literally stumbling through the door,  and the second they see that their subject of their show is just geese,  they light up all the cameras.  Oh, they must have been fucking happy, man.  Oh, my God, they must have been.  Gold.  Half a second before, like, dude, we're getting canceled.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, he's like when Urkel showed up on Family Matters, like, thank God.  Here we go.  Opens the door, there's a shining aura behind him.  I said, no, I'm not done, because my point is to be fascinating. 
[03:07:00]  So, I go, you guys, you guys, you want to see something really cool?  So, we go up to my gym, and I take off my shirt,  and I think they think I'm just being this total narcissist,  because I'm in pretty good shape at this point,  and I'm just standing there shirtless,  and I reach into this fishing tackle box, and I pull out a needle.  I mean, they're huge, these needles, because steroids are oil-based,  so they release slowly.  So, there's essentially the consistency of motor oil. 
[03:07:30]  So, the needle has got to be gigantic.  So, it's not like you're taking a needle.  It's like you're wounding yourself.  So, I go, you guys, you guys, you want to see something cool?  Watch this.  Pow, right through my shoulder.  And I had done it before, but I was showing off, and I hit the bone.  Oh, God damn.  I go, oh, my God, and I let go of the needle,  which is now sticking out of my shoulder.  And I'm going, oh, my God, what do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  And then, finally, I shoot the stuff in, and I pull it out, 
[03:08:00]  and there's just blood everywhere.  Holy crap.  And it's dripping down my arm.  I've got a needle in my hand.  And I don't know.  I promise you, the director is the sweetest man in the world  and had my best interests at heart.  But somebody had to be going, oh, my God, this is good.  Gold, yeah.  The fact that they name it Breaking Bonaduce,  I don't think they're rooting for your health.  I named it Breaking Bonaduce.  Oh, my fault, my fault.  Yeah, but I called them up,  because you get a 10-minute phone call every day.  And I called them up, and I said, 
[03:08:30]  you've got to change the title to Breaking Bonaduce.  It'll give people an idea of what they're in for.  It's just not fair to have being Bonaduce.  People think they're going to watch a Peter Brady show.  You know, it's Peter Brady with a bike through his head.  Danny, this is obviously one of these very stereotypical child star things.  Where did the anger come from?  You know what?  I'm not that angry of a guy.  But aren't you in anger management class or something? 
[03:09:00]  No, I didn't go.  I didn't fucking need it.  You only got a problem if you show up.  Right.  Those are the people.  I don't want to give too much away,  because these guys,  this is the very first interview I've ever done  where there isn't a VH1 publicist on the other end of the phone.  Thank God.  You've done a lot of radio.  How much do you hate that,  when all of a sudden you hear the publicist,  that's too far, that's enough, that's enough.  And they actually cut the connection in the middle of the interview  because you asked something a little too crazy? 
[03:09:30]  Actually, they say, don't do that to me.  I made that real clear.  Good.  I made it real clear.  Okay.  I know your job.  This is my job.  You can shake your head at me.  Aside from that, that's that.  But, Danny, the thing is, what is it?  Is it getting screwed out of money?  Is it the fact that you grow up  and all of a sudden you're not getting the parts anymore?  There just seems to be that,  what the fuck happens to you guys?  Well, you know what I mean?  The actual stars on drugs?  Yeah, it's always drugs.  You know, but I don't think it's fair 
[03:10:00]  that me, Todd Bridges, and Eddie Munster  can bring down an entire industry.  Oh, man, yeah.  All right, you got a point there.  It's just the three.  We're the most pussy gang in the world.  Hey, fucking Blossom's doing fine, asshole.  Which one is the one that's doing the punk rock thing?  Oh, that was...  Courtship of Eddie's father?  Courtship of Eddie's father, what did you tell?  He's a really nice guy, by the way,  so I'm not making fun.  I'm just reporting.  He's 107 years old with green hair. 
[03:10:30]  It's a big mistake.  I think you're a punk rocker.  Is this like some kind of weird fraternity  and you guys all keep in touch with each other?  Yeah, we're best pals.  I'm pretty sure Urkel's coming over.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.  You and...  It's weird.  Is it true that you...  The Brady's actually get together.  Yeah.  That's so strange.  Unless there's partridge barbecues going on  that I'm just not invited to.  We can hang out.  Hey, you know, Barry Williams used to be  a pretty good friend of ours, 
[03:11:00]  and then he's going through a divorce.  Do you know what that's about at all?  No, I don't.  All right.  It's not like I said.  The last time I saw Greg Brady,  I was beating his ass.  Dude, you laid waste to him.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  The celebrity fight?  Oh, my God.  And the whole lead-up to it  was just them showing how Danny  just can fucking, like, rip a tiger apart.  And there's Greg Brady, like,  yeah, well, I'm going to go in there  and give it my shot.  And they're showing, like,  Danny knows martial arts, 
[03:11:30]  and he's in fucking shape,  and now we know he's fucking  driving motor oil into his shoulders.  I know.  And he just goes in there  and kicks his ass.  I didn't mean to beat him so badly  because, at first,  because he's much bigger than I am.  Yeah.  At first, these people kept coming in to me  and people that would know,  like his trainer,  came in and said,  listen, man,  you've got to take it easy on this guy.  You're going to look like a bully.  Yeah.  And I thought,  well, this is a professional trainer. 
[03:12:00]  He's lying.  I'm going to get rid of it  because he knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  And then somebody else said it,  and then somebody else said,  listen, we really need to get  three rounds out of this  if you know what I'm saying.  I said, okay,  don't you worry about it.  Carry him a little.  No problem.  So I get out there  and I'm dancing around.  Well, you know,  I make Jake LaMotta  look like a ballerina.  I'm the most female.  I got one gear  and it's forward.  And so I'm trying to dance around  so not to actually fight the guy.  And then the audience booed. 
[03:12:30]  And once the audience booed,  that's it, man.  And then I killed him.  Yeah.  You know what's funny  is I beat him really badly.  And I felt bad  and after it was over,  I went up to him  and I really thanked him  because I really wanted to do it.  And all my opponents  kept backing out.  Yeah.  They couldn't find an opponent for me.  So he agreed to say,  I went over and I said,  thank you so much for doing this.  I really wanted to do it.  And I wouldn't have gotten  an opportunity  unless you agreed  and all this really nice stuff.  But his back  was all covered in blood. 
[03:13:00]  And I don't know  if it was the ropes  or the canvas,  which is real rough,  but I mean,  he was, you know,  the passion of the crisis.  I mean, he was lashed.  You tooled him really bad.  You know who else  got nailed really bad  was that fucking  Arnold Horshack.  Horshack, yeah.  Screech.  Well, that was his  Screech.  He shouldn't have done that.  Oh, I know.  It's like they take this old guy  and put him in with a young guy.  And that was...  They took,  allegedly,  an old queen  with a reasonably  of young,  healthy man.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  He just got the shit beat out of him.  Did he still have his glasses on?  What about Paula Jones  versus Watch Your Face,  the skater?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was another good one.  That was another good one.  Tonya Harding?  It just appeared  that Greg Brady had a chance.  Yeah.  Because they were wrong.  Funny shit, man.  So what's going on  with your wife?  Hey, first of all,  the story is bizarre.  You really got married  after only knowing her  a few hours?  Yeah.  I'll give you  a quick rundown on this. 
[03:14:00]  Met my wife  on a blind date.  We went out to dinner  and I was drinking heavily,  imagine.  And I just assumed  she was too.  You know,  we were having  a great big party.  We go to my house.  I put the moves on her  and she pushes me back  and says,  you know,  I probably should have  mentioned this earlier.  I'm a Christian  and I'm not prepared  to do that  until I'm married.  And I said,  hey,  you might have mentioned  that $90 ago.  And then I thought, 
[03:14:30]  not that unreasonable  of a request.  It turns out  there's pages of ministers  called,  why don't we be married  15 years now?  Holy shit.  You got married  just so you could get laid.  Now that's a man.  He's filthy good.  Some guys will go  a certain level.  Yeah.  I'm going to go  20 pounds overweight  tonight.  That's my big commitment.  Not me.  I'll get married for it.  Wow.  You hear stories like that  but you don't hear  that they actually  stay together.  Right. 
[03:15:00]  Especially after all  the bullshit.  I was going to say  happy as I've ever been  but that's not true.  I'll tell you honestly  this show,  well I can't say the show  because it's my behavior  and I've got to look at.  But the behavior  I displayed on this show  really drove us apart  a little bit.  That got ugly.  It's very friendly now  but it's not what it was.  I've got to kind of  work my way back into that.  The weird thing  on one of the first shows 
[03:15:30]  was how she talked about  how she doesn't like  having sex.  Right.  That's a big problem.  Well.  That could be a huge problem.  Well, not for me.  And then you're training  like lesbian porn stars  in the gym and stuff  and she's really pissed off  at you and wants you  to drop all the female  clients that you had.  Right.  Well, here was my theory  on that which I think  is valid but when you're  talking to a PhD  anything that doesn't  sound totally normal  like Ozzie and Harriet  is crazy.  Here's my theory on that  because I had the affair 
[03:16:00]  and it was a big drag  but here's my theory  because Gretchen  doesn't like sex, right?  Well, it's like saying  Gretchen will not cook  yet she won't let me  eat anywhere else.  Yeah, it's just like  you know, it does make sense.  Sure.  It does make sense.  It makes sense  because we're best friends too.  If she just let me bone  I'll live with this woman  for the rest of my life.  You're speaking the truth  my friend.  Thank you.  You're speaking for  many, many guys  out there.  I'm just speaking 
[03:16:30]  out loud  for many, many guys.  And the other observation  I had was that  you got a very, very  normal daughter there  that's going into  the business, huh?  No, as a matter of fact  she recently decided  it was boring  so she's done.  Oh, she is done  because part of the show  is showing her  on auditions and stuff.  Yeah, I took her  and I took her  on auditions  and she's, you know,  she's probably got  40 grand put away.  Jeez, we saw her  in a stroller  and she'll have  it paid for.  And like I said  she's up in a room  doing blow right now  at P.C.  Yeah.  You know, Danny 
[03:17:00]  we met you  at the comedy store  Anthony brought up  a point  because I brought  the show  to our attention  or whatever  and we were talking  to him like  you know that  baby we saw  on the stroller  when we saw  Danny and his wife  back at the comedy store  Oh, that's right!  Yeah.  This is about  I don't even know anymore  like 10, 12 years ago  Yeah, over 10 years ago  Oh, 10  so it was a newborn  it was about 10 years ago then.  Yeah, you were walking  around with a newborn  and we were doing  all those lame interviews  down at the comedy store  like the big star 
[03:17:30]  that showed up  I think was Greg Brady  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You know,  because I do the exact same thing  you'll sit there  in the circle of  and no offense  but in a lot of parts  of the country  jocks are the most  offensive people  in the world.  Yeah.  You look around  almost some kind of  because people can't see you  it's an excuse  not only to get  big, fat, and ugly  but for some reason  to have gravy  on your shirt.  When we first started 
[03:18:00]  together about 10 years ago  Ann and I  we did a lot of those  and we gave up on them  I don't know  6, 7 years ago  we couldn't take it.  The fake radio voices  and the fake toughness  and it was just awful.  Absolutely.  And you had to hang out  with these guys  in the same room.  Danny, we lose you?  I think we lost Danny.  Yeah, his phone was  clicking and clacking  the whole time.  There he is.  Oh, wait.  Danny, are you back?  Yeah, I am.  I'm back.  Whatever.  I was making a dumb point  anyway.  It doesn't matter.  So, you know,  I'd do the same thing  you guys would do.  My radio station  would be there  and I'd be in that 
[03:18:30]  big U of disc jockeys  they'd bring by  the celebrities  but there'd never  be any celebrities  except me.  So they'd take me  from my radio station  and walk me around  to everybody else's radio station.  Yeah, I remember  seeing that.  Like, you would be up  interviewing with  other radio stations  yet you were there  doing the same thing  all the radio guys  were doing.  Paul Abdul-Record  is about to run out.  I've got to get back  to my table.  Hey, Danny,  you made the gossip column  in the Daily News today.  Maybe it's all over the country.  I don't know.  I believe it is.  Oh, you've heard?  You want to talk about this  or what? 
[03:19:00]  You know what?  Is it the legal matter?  Yeah, with Jamie White.  Yeah, no, I can't.  She said some weird shit  about you.  She says weird  about me is fine.  She says some weird  stuff about my kid.  Oh.  Which, yeah,  it's one of the very few  things I don't find amusing.  Okay.  Thank you, though.  No, I'm just curious  because it's a big story today.  Why did you get fired  from that job?  I swear to God,  I don't know.  Because I even went  to my boss  and I said,  listen, man,  I'm in trouble.  I need to go to rehab. 
[03:19:30]  I need to know also  because I've never missed  a day of work  in my entire life.  I've never been sick.  I've never been late.  I mean, I am  a together drunk.  So I said,  listen,  I really feel  I need to go to rehab,  but I need to know  my job will be here  when I get back.  And he said,  Danny,  not only do we want you back,  of course,  but you're within  your legal rights  and the law  is on your side.  And then I got back  from rehab  and they fired me.  Fucking radios.  That's what I said.  Yep.  Commercial radios. 
[03:20:00]  If anybody's looking  for a jock,  I'm available.  Well, we're looking  to give out  some golden tickets  for XM Satellite Radio,  my friend.  Right on.  Yeah, we're looking  to rescue a few more guys  from the awful world  of commercial radio.  Nastiness of commercials  and not being able  to say hell anymore.  So we'll have to talk...  By the way,  you guys,  this is the first  satellite radio show  I've ever done  and I'm on hold  and you said,  I don't know,  and you just went,  ah, fuck it.  Oh my God,  that's so cool.  It is so cool, man.  And we don't have  18-minute commercial blocks,  none of that crap. 
[03:20:30]  You're just talking  until you feel like  stopping for a while  and then you go  take a leak.  Well, that is awesome.  That is awesome.  Yeah, pretty cool.  Well, when's the show on?  Sundays.  It seems to be changing.  I believe it is 10.30  on Sunday nights.  And that's when  I'd like you to watch it  because that's when  the ratings count,  but they show it  18 times a week.  Yeah.  It's called  Breaking Bonaduce  on VH1  and watch it  whenever you like.  Yeah, I don't think  you've got to worry, man.  This one's a winner.  Jesus Christ.  It's too much.  Oh, you've seen us  on The View. 
[03:21:00]  It was awesome.  They hated us.  You invited Gretchen  and I on The View  and like Barbara Walters  goes on the attack,  but in the beginning  of the show,  she's talking about  the president  wrote a note  to Condoleezza Rice  saying,  I have to go  to the bathroom.  Is that possible?  And a photographer  got a picture  of that note  and they were  making fun of it.  And Barbara Walters  says,  that's how I got  where I am.  I never have to pee.  I can outweighed anybody  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:21:30]  So I go out on stage  and one time  she starts being  really mean to me  and I go,  are you kidding?  You're going to judge  my show  when you just spent  four minutes  on the fact  that Barbara Walters  doesn't have to pee?  And this definitely  got cut out.  I thought it was cool.  Star Jones goes,  I am not even willing  to talk about this.  And I said,  try keeping your mouth  shut next to a buffet.  Bravo.  Oh, no.  We hate her.  We hate Star Jones.  You know what's great? 
[03:22:00]  You get Danny  on interview shows  like that  and people will try  to get you.  They'll try to like  bring stuff up  but Danny won't deny it.  It's not like,  no, well,  what I meant  was this,  what you saw  was it,  it's just,  no, yeah,  that shit happened.  Next.  You know,  I'll give you  the perfect example  of that.  So Danny,  I read you  picked up  a transvestite hooker.  What really happened?  Well,  I picked up a hooker  and turned out  to be a guy  and I got all pissed off.  It's not like  I'm not going to tell him.  I'm pretty hard  to hurt. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  That story  got blown out of proportion.  I wasn't even  near a hooker.  It was,  no, yeah,  hooker,  reached down,  got a handful of knob  and decided to punch him  in the fucking face.  He had a wiener  and he wasn't supposed to.  He demanded,  he goes,  you owe me 40 bucks  because you took me  off my corner.  I go,  buddy,  get out of the car.  It's just a misunderstanding.  And he said,  no,  you owe me 40 bucks.  You took me off my corner.  I said,  I'm going to give you  one more chance  to get out of this car.  So I go over  to this side of the door  and I pull him out of the car  and he's big. 
[03:23:00]  And now I realize  this is a large man  in fishnets  and pumps  who's selling his ass.  This could be really dangerous.  So I beat the  but Jesus  out of this guy.  And then,  you'll love this part  because this is  things that are to me.  I've heard every story  that you can imagine  and this pops it off for me.  So I see the cops  and they're coming  and I think,  I can explain this.  And he lost,  right?  He lost bad,  but he just lost.  And then I thought, 
[03:23:30]  ooh,  Danny Pudridge  beats transvestment.  I gotta go.  So I jump in my car  and I run.  And I get to listen  to the high-speed chase  I'm in  on the car stereo  of the car I'm dropping.  And that was something.  Oh my God.  That's great, man.  That was a big night out.  You are the real deal, Danny.  Well, thank you.  What do we get to watch you  do on TV  in future episodes? 
[03:24:00]  Let's see.  You know what?  To be honest,  I swear to God,  and I'm not being coy here,  there are huge gaps  of what I remember.  Wow.  So he's gotta watch the show  just to know what he did.  I'm not watching the show.  No?  No.  Why?  Why is that?  Because from what I've heard,  I'm ridiculous.  I get heard  and people are suing me.  Are you trying to say  you're embarrassed  by how you look on TV?  Only, only,  because  when I'm all lit up 
[03:24:30]  and ready,  like my own crew,  I love this shot.  I love this shot  and I know it made it.  At one point,  my own crew  calls the police on me.  I forget what happened.  My wife at the W Hotel  having this party,  somebody says something  I don't like,  I say to the limousine driver,  take me to the W Hotel  right now.  And the director  says no.  And I said,  hey,  the name of the show  is breaking all that  that being.  Bonaduce.  That makes it my show,  that makes this my limousine.  Take me to the W Hotel  right now.  And the guy goes, 
[03:25:00]  no.  So I said,  really?  And I just opened  the door and jumped  at about 25.  They just used to be  rolling down the street.  And I get up  and I stop a car.  Like I'm the police.  I just stop this car.  And the guy goes,  hey,  you're doing part of this?  And they said,  yeah,  will you take me  to the W Hotel?  And he says,  sure,  hop in.  So I hop in,  I drive up,  and they cut to this producer,  and he's on the phone  to the W Hotel.  And he's saying,  listen,  Danny Bonaduce is  on his way down there, 
[03:25:30]  and somebody is  going to get hurt.  You should call  the police right now.  That's my own crew.  Holy shit.  How are you going to do it?  Out of control.  How are you going to get  a second season  of this show,  by the way?  I can beat the hell  out of me.  Yeah,  it's the type of show  I don't see how  you could possibly  do a second season.  Well,  you know,  things have occurred to me.  Because we're,  and here's what  I think might be  interesting.  I'm not,  you know,  because I really do  need to work again.  These shows don't pay  very much.  I need to go back  to radio. 
[03:26:00]  Right.  But I don't live  like regular people  ever.  The fact that I was  drunk makes me  this wild drunk.  The fact that I do  a great deal  of those things  after giving it  careful consideration  and think,  hey,  let's play shoot,  bitch.  I think that's  even more interesting.  Thinking it out,  knowing the ramifications,  and playing anyway,  I think is just  as interesting.  Yeah.  Wow.  And I was so mad  at VH1 about one thing. 
[03:26:30]  They go to pull the plug,  they come up to me  and they go,  hey,  listen,  Danny,  we're going to pull  the plug on the show.  And I said,  why?  And they said,  we believe that you're  dying.  And I said,  perfect.  Why would you not  want to roll on that?  The death of a bee mister?  That would be huge.  Why would you not  want to shoot  until I die?  And they kind of  all looked around like,  please,  that's a good point.  But then they put me  in rehab anyway.  That's the ultimate goal  of reality TV.  It really is,  and it has been.  It's been leading 
[03:27:00]  toward that.  Yeah,  that's the end  of that genre.  It's been leading  there the whole time.  We almost got there  with Pedro  in real world  San Francisco.  Watched him die  on TV  for 12 weeks  or whatever it was.  Just about,  but someone completely  self-destructive.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah,  that was nasty.  Yeah,  we're never going  to be on TV,  Danny.  We pitched a show  to A&E  the other day.  It wasn't our idea.  It wasn't your finest moment.  It was completely,  we were completely embarrassed.  Wait a minute,  wait a minute.  Don't we have 
[03:27:30]  to be pitched a show  to A&E?  A&E.  Yeah,  isn't that great?  Do we have  a great agent  or what?  This is a good show.  We basically pitched  Mythbusters  meets Jackass.  Oh yeah,  I didn't even love that.  Yeah,  exactly.  They looked at us  like we had  like two heads,  the famous...  I got the weirdest  thing happening there.  I can't believe it.  I thought by now,  you know,  because you know radio,  no matter how crazy  I got the show,  the show's a huge success.  I thought my phone  would be ringing  off the hook 
[03:28:00]  with radio offers.  No,  no,  regular radio,  they're petrified.  Everyone's petrified now.  You realize you can't  even say fart  on regular radio?  Is that over now?  Yeah.  And you know how  Danny knows the game.  You know how you would  get away with shit  and talk double entendre  and talk around things?  Now they're finding  DJs because they know  what we were trying to say.  Yeah,  it says,  well,  yeah,  they say,  well,  we know what you meant.  And everyone knew  what you meant,  so we're going to find you,  even though you never said  that the penis  went into the vagina. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Oh God,  I never knew that.  I did not know that.  Business sucks ass.  That's outrageous.  Dude,  they're helping us out  with the satellite radio.  Everyone's coming aboard  in droves at this point.  Well,  good.  I appreciate you  knowing where a good avenue is.  But can I ask you  a real live question  that maybe you can  help me out with?  Yeah.  I've got lunch today  with a really huge producer guy  for TV and two movies,  right?  He's got,  well,  he's just a big shot.  He's a real live big shot.  He's not some Hollywood guy  that says,  I've got a deal. 
[03:29:00]  He's a real big shot.  He's meeting with me  because he's watched the show  and he thinks,  Danny Bonaduce is one of  the scariest people on earth.  I really want to meet him.  I've got some projects.  What do I wear?  Do I show up looking normal  or do I show up for lunch  looking freaky?  Looks scary.  Looks scary?  If he wants,  if he's saying  Danny Bonaduce is one  of the scariest people  and I want to capitalize on that,  you need like  a fucking wife beater shirt. 
[03:29:30]  Danny.  Yeah?  Here's the deal.  Yeah?  You go to the meeting  with a butcher knife, right?  That occurred to me.  Hold on.  You got a film crew, right?  Right in front of him.  You lop off one of your fingers.  You got ten.  You don't need them all.  And they could probably  sew it right back on.  Yeah, and maybe they could  sew it back on.  You take like,  just take one knuckle out, man,  right in front of him.  Like in Sharky's machine.  The crew, the show is wrapped.  So I won't have a film crew,  but if you're looking, 
[03:30:00]  it seems to be the right indication  as to,  God, I want to say how crazy I am  because it seems normal  and right to me.  Yeah.  There is,  I was very sad  that I had this affair.  I love my wife  and I did not mean  to have an affair, right?  Yeah.  And there,  I'm a big fan  of the Japanese culture.  I'm a third degree black belt.  I speak Japanese.  And in the Yakuza,  which is the Japanese  organized crime,  there is a way  no matter what you have done  that you can apologize once.  And it's to cut off  the top knuckle 
[03:30:30]  of your little finger  and present it  in a box  to the person you've offended.  Do it.  So I looked at my wife  and I said,  who I didn't even know about this,  and I said,  listen, honey,  I'm going to apologize to you  in a way  that you have to accept.  And she usually rolls her eyes  and she goes,  you know,  if you cut off your finger,  it won't mean anything to me.  Everybody knows  you can cut off your finger.  Try behaving.  God damn, man.  She knows you. 
[03:31:00]  Yes, she does.  I mean,  30 seconds,  wow,  I was a bitch  for a lifetime of behaving?  Jesus.  Danny,  we got to talk radio with you.  How can Eric Logan  get a hold of you?  Call me at home.  Oh, we got your numbers?  All right, good.  I was assuming you do, yeah.  Yeah, cool, man.  Because we do have  some spots left  and, man,  you're very interesting.  We've been following you  for years  and we bump heads  every once in a while  with you.  And you've always  been very kind to me  and I appreciate that  and I appreciate this time today.  I really, you know,  the show's important to me. 
[03:31:30]  A very obscure thing.  We saw you walking out  of a hamburger joint  on, what was it, Anthony?  Sixth Avenue.  Remember that horrible,  horrible burger joint  and we ended up  killing them on the air?  Oh, yeah.  And you walked out of it.  A place called the Oyster Bar.  There's a couple different  Oyster Bars in New York City.  Yeah, I know it.  I know it.  All right,  but the one on,  I think it was like  56 or 55th Street.  Yeah, no, no.  I only went to the one.  I know exactly what you were talking about.  And you were walking out of there  as we were walking in  and we just kind of said  hey to each other.  No big deal.  We didn't really talk  and we ended up going in there  and having the worst hamburger ever. 
[03:32:00]  Don't go to an outing  after I'd have gotten blamed for it.  And you became part  of the story that day  because we're like,  Jesus, you know,  he's walking out of the place  and it had to be good.  It's a celebrity.  It's got to be good, right?  It's got some cash left.  Yeah.  It was just, whatever.  It's just a dumb, obscure thing.  Danny Bonaduce is walking out.  This place must suck.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Danny.  It's always a pleasure.  Hey, thanks for the time, you guys.  I sincerely appreciate it.  Hey, thank you, man.  Don't kill yourself, all right?  Okay.  Well, not until the second season. 
[03:32:30]  Danny Bonaduce.  Thanks, Danny.  Bye, guys.  All right.  There he goes.  That rocked.  Absolutely.  Evangeline.  Yes.  All right.  You're going to be  the grand finale  of the Opie and Anthony program  this week.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Hold on two seconds.  Jill.  Hey, Jill.  Hi.  Jill, hi.  What do you want to do?  Well, my husband's  a huge, huge fan of you,  and he's been pressuring me  to call in and play that game,  What's in My Pants?  Oh, great. 
[03:33:00]  You got a phone?  Yeah.  All right.  Your pants down?  They can be arranged.  All right.  Pull them down.  We'll play the theme song.  Okay.  Yeah, let's play.  Yeah, that's a great idea.  Yeah.  Let's play Guess What's in My Pants  with Jill from Canada.  This is awesome.  Here's the theme song.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver  upon your beaver. 
[03:33:30]  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess  what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right, Jill.  Jill, you know how the game's played.  We're going to ask you  to rub the phone  on your most intimate of area  in various ways,  and we will guess  what type of hairstyle you have.  There's the basic triangle  that a woman sports all the time.  There's the mohawk,  which is just a strip.  There's the Hitler mustache,  which is the little patch,  and the wood floor,  clean shaved,  or JonBenet Ramsey,  is what we call that.  And really fast, Jill,  are you hot? 
[03:34:00]  I don't know, am I?  I emailed you some pictures.  Oh, well,  we'll have to take a look.  No, we'll take your word for it.  Yeah, we'll take your word for it  that you're hot.
