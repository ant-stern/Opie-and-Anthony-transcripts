<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with complaints about the intro music's low volume, followed by the hosts recounting their long weekend. Opie detailed boating and an air show, while Anthony described unexpectedly cold weather.  Significant airtime was devoted to their frustration with Stephanie Scamardo's unauthorized use of their studio for voice tracking,  expressing anger at the disrespect shown to their workspace and equipment.

The conversation then shifted to Jimmy's experience at Adam Carolla's comedy event in Los Angeles, describing the unusual setting and mentioning the presence of Jay Leno and Jeff Ross amongst others.  This was followed by a caller, Fontaine, recounting Opie's reckless bicycle riding and helicopter antics, prompting playful banter. Anthony further detailed his own boat trip around Manhattan, including a Jersey City Starbucks stop and mentioning his "boat people" friends: Keith, Rob, John, Big Carl, and Tex the Pilot, along with his attendance at the Jones Beach air show.  A substantial portion focused on Sam Roberts' interview with Vince McMahon regarding a conflict with Stan Kroenke, analyzing McMahon's response on Monday Night Raw, including a physical altercation with a Kroenke impersonator and jokes about the impersonator's name.  The hosts discussed the absurdity of the situation and the financial aspects of professional wrestling, including the cost of wrestler autographs, using Virgil as an example.

The show then moved to a discussion on the high cost of celebrity autographs and traffic changes in Times Square.  A serious discussion about Mike Tyson's daughter's treadmill accident transitioned into a broader conversation on overprotective parenting and childhood injuries, contrasted with the hosts' own experiences.  This led to a deeply personal account by one of the hosts (Jimmy) detailing childhood sexual abuse, prompting listener calls.  A caller recounted their numerous childhood injuries leading to police questioning of their parents; another described a steam pipe injury.  Lydia, a regular caller acting as a “middle school therapist,” was a guest in the studio, offering analysis of the hosts’ personalities.  A humorous misinterpretation of Mr. T’s “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” and clips of a cheese rolling competition were also included.  Google Maps was used to locate "Devil's Creek," significant to one host's childhood.

A rambling segment followed, featuring an unseen contributor, Sam Roberts.  The hosts discussed concerns about Anthony Cumia's isolation and Jim Norton's "sexual issues," transitioning to a vulgar description of "Devil's Creek."  Brief discussions touched upon the NBA playoffs, the Indianapolis 500, and a lengthy, humorous bit about a fictional, incompetent Indy 500 driver, Ted Sheckler, focusing on his bodily functions and car smell.  A Mr. T catchphrase trivia game led to a discussion of the hosts' own catchphrases and mockery of Helio Castroneves' emotional Indy 500 win, comparing it to Mike Schmidt's retirement speech.  A racist and vulgar joke about a suicidal man pushed off a bridge was included, along with discussion of the listener call-in segment, the "F.U. line," and vulgar mockery of Lady Gaga and Jamie Foxx's music and personas, including commentary on Lady Gaga's appearance.  The segment also included a comedic auto-tuned news report and a discussion of the movie *Booty Call*.

The final segment began with a discussion of Led Zeppelin and Ozzy Osbourne, comparing their styles and stage personas, using derogatory terms to describe Robert Plant's perceived effeminacy.  A Led Zeppelin concert video was analyzed, focusing on Plant's sexuality and John Bonham's limited screen time. Ozzy Osbourne's image was contrasted with Plant's.  A caller defended Robert Plant.  The conversation expanded to The Who and their aging members, a caller's suggestion of an embarrassing Robert Plant music video ("Sea of Love"), and a description of a now-deleted Pee-wee Herman appearance on 30 Rock.  A segment on E-Rock's lactose intolerance ("pizza problem") and a report from his fiancée followed, concluding with a discussion of bacon-flavored products and a review of *Terminator Salvation*.  The show also featured a discussion of the *Terminator* franchise, criticizing later installments and their plot points (including Terminators moonwalking), and a discussion of parody films like *Scary Movie*, *Airplane*, *Hot Shots*, *Major League*, and *Naked Gun*.  A detailed discussion of a vulgar scene from *Nuts* featuring Richard Dreyfuss, Barbra Streisand, and Leslie Nielsen, and a search for a clip online, was included.  The show ended with a news report about a bee swarm in a lower Manhattan building and a humorous anecdote about a fictional, unorthodox bee removal expert, Ted.  The game "Vossopedia" was also mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Whoa. I don't know what that is.  We have the big opening, and then it just gets low.  The urgent music is at a whisper.  Yeah.  If you're going to play urgent music, it's got to be pretty loud.  Yeah, the urgent, oh my god, they're on the air.  Oh my god, what's going on?  They're broadcasting, we're open for business at...  Instead it was...  A little whisper. 
[00:00:30]  It's a whisper telling people we're here.  Unbelievable. Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Another fine week of broadcasting about to begin.  Oh, yes.  We don't even know what's going to happen this week, but we can tell you this much, something cool will happen.  Guaranteed a good week.  We guarantee that, right?  Is it guaranteed? What kind of guarantee can we offer?  It's a guarantee.  That there'll be a show the next day, perhaps, to make up for a bad show?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:01:00]  Ah!  How's everybody?  Good.  Good?  Relaxed after a little vacation?  You pretty much had a vacation.  Ah, four days.  First day, not quite a vacation, but off.  And then, you know, then the weekend, long weekend shenanigans.  Ah, hanging out, boating involved, and air show.  All those summer activities. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, just fun stuff.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I had a great time.  And now, you know, now it's going to be cold again today.  Yeah, what's that about?  Ah, it's about suck.  I walked out of my place, I'm like, what's this?  What's this?  It's annoying as hell is what it is.  Memorial Day weekend.  That officially says, okay, enough of the weird weather, and now it's sunny for 40 straight  days, and you know, where are the clouds and the rain, just to break it up a little  bit.  But today is cold.  It's so goddamn annoying. 
[00:02:00]  Just get warm and stay that way.  It's almost June.  Is it June?  When's June?  It's May 26th.  Okay, it's close enough.  Close enough to June.  Yeah, close enough where it shouldn't be, you shouldn't need a jacket anymore.  Mm-hmm.  Very rare occasion should you need a little light, little long sleeve or something.  But, yeah, come on.  Wow, I'm cranked over here.  You got any volume for me over there?  Yeah, I got a little volume. 
[00:02:30]  Mars, who's in the studio?  Over the long weekend?  I can't get any more volume for myself.  No?  I'm not blowing out Anthony.  Okay, I'll turn down a little.  Somebody was in the studio, it's obvious.  Yes.  Do you know who?  No, I don't.  Yeah, it's very obvious to me.  I hope they weren't trying to...  That happens.  Oh, I should turn down?  Okay.  You good?  No, no, I'm way too loud.  There, I'll turn up.  Oh, that's good. 
[00:03:00]  I like that.  I'm fine.  Who's in here?  This is great.  This distracts everything.  It's called...  The Deaf Show was in.  Didn't we make a rule if someone uses the studio, they're not allowed to touch anything?  They use our studio as is, right?  Yes, sir.  It's like someone getting in your car and you got all your settings.  Yeah, yeah.  I just need your car for like five minutes.  I gotta go get cigarettes.  And then, next time you're in the car, everything is adjust...  You had to adjust everything for a five-minute car ride? 
[00:03:30]  Ah, I'll tell you who was the master of doing that.  Master Poe did that to you all the time, right?  It was a two-block drive in my vehicle, and every single thing was reset.  The seats, the mirrors, the radio, the angle that the nav screen was on, the headlight settings,  everything was completely screwed up.  For two blocks. 
[00:04:00]  So, for the first few blocks I'm driving, I'm adjusting mirrors and radio stations from urban shit to, you know...  Right.  Who was in here?  I have the culprit.  Who?  I've checked the studio scheduling map here, and on the 23rd and 24th, we had voice tracking sessions with Stephanie Scamardo.  No!  That's not supposed to happen ever!  What is it voice tracking?  No!  What is it in this studio?  Why is that? 
[00:04:30]  Why isn't there voice tracking going on?  On the 23rd and 24th.  In a voice tracking studio.  No!  That's not supposed to happen!  Didn't the last time it was on the schedule, but it didn't actually happen?  Look, uh...  I bet it happened.  Well, we'll get to the...  Can you get to the bottom of it immediately?  Sure.  Immediately.  Because it was promised to us that it was supposed to be one show, and then there was a list.  Well, then it's going to be this, this, and this, but that's it.  No one else.  And now they're doing voice tracking?  Voice tracking.  Enough with fucking us up the ass over here.  Really.  How about you start treating us with a little respect? 
[00:05:00]  There's a closet with a microphone down the hallway they could do voice tracking.  There's a million studios, but, you know...  Yeah.  But we're the, you know...  Ah!  Respect!  That didn't take long.  I know.  I was looking at my watch just going...  That's why...  Oh, right?  That's why I ended with the...  Ah!  Instead of a 15-minute rant that everyone's heard.  But enough.  We want all the respect.  We're doing our...  Our jobs.  We are holding up our end of the bargain. 
[00:05:30]  Stop treating us like shit.  No voice tracking in here.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T.  If you're going to make us a studio, then it's our studio.  Yeah.  Not everyone's studio.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Hopefully, Steve, we'll get to the bottom of it.  But, you know...  Yes.  To bladder in the rest of them.  I love getting to the bottom.  To bladder in the rest of them.  Someone's messing with all the knobs, so the first five or ten minutes every day...  Not every day, but, you know, we have to spend readjusting everything, which kind of  distracts the whole rhythm and flow of what we're attempting to do every day. 
[00:06:00]  It turns into the turning the knob show.  Right.  I mean, you know...  You got a live show over here.  Yeah.  Unlike the other guy who, I guess, has another week off.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah.  That's got to be nice.  No kidding.  Wow.  Go use his stupid facility.  Kazowie.  He's only there part-time.  Go over there and use his facility for all this junk.  He's a part-timer.  He's a part-timer with an amazing facility. 
[00:06:30]  So have everyone use that part of the building.  Over there.  We're actually here on a full-time basis.  We don't need free weeks to get everyone hooked.  We're doing our job.  Wait a minute.  There we go.  That's true, though.  I know it's true.  Wait till I send you an email later today.  All right.  I'll tell you what that was really about.  Good one.  Mm-hmm.  Nice fun one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I'm sure everybody had a pleasant holiday weekend. 
[00:07:00]  What did you do, Jimmy?  I went to L.A.  Yes.  Yes.  And ate like a pig.  Yeah.  I ate like a fatso.  Yeah.  It was a benefit.  You're supposed to eat like a pig at a benefit.  No, but I did it.  I started eating a red velvet cake here that had nothing to do with the benefit.  Ooh.  And then I was like a pig on the plane.  But you had to eat that for the birthday celebration.  Whose birthday was it?  Thanks.  Thanks a lot. 
[00:07:30]  I appreciate that.  So we had cake for him for his birthday.  And then I went to L.A. and ate like a pig.  Yeah.  And the Saturday game was good.  It was quick.  You know, it was Jeff Ross, Carolla Jeff, Saget, myself, Patton Oswalt, and Leno.  But I saw the pictures.  You guys were like doing comedy in an open field or something.  That was the weirdest setup ever.  What stuck?  I don't know what the hell was going on.  It was Carolla's.  It didn't look like an easy place to do comedy is what I'm getting at.  No, it wasn't.  It was like Carolla's backyard. 
[00:08:00]  There's a lot of people there, though.  I mean, it's a large property.  Yeah.  But it was like you were in his yard doing comedy.  There's a lawn chair set up.  Oh, Jesus.  And then you do his set.  Then you run down a level lower and do a podcast overlooking the big valley in Malibu.  It was kind of nice.  We were right across the street from Harry Mandel's house and right down the street from  Emilio Estevez and Martin Sheen.  I wanted Martin Sheen to pop out so bad.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  How did Carolla get such a nice spot out there? 
[00:08:30]  I guess he's made some busts over there.  He must have made some cake.  Over the years?  A little cake?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw the pictures, though.  They were very bizarre.  I didn't see them.  What pictures?  It was like you were performing at a bar mitzvah or something.  Where did you see them?  Whackbag had them, I believe, over the weekend.  How?  How?  How?  I saw a wire image photo.  I assume that you, I don't know, you put it on Twitter or something.  No.  And they picked it up.  I took one picture of Leno.  I didn't take that.  It's Carolla's people. 
[00:09:00]  If you go to Whackbag, you can check out some of the pictures.  Look at the stage.  Look at that.  It looks like.  It's a stage with a band set up, a little riser, and you're in the middle of a field.  Yeah.  It looks like it's someone's birthday party and they got the local, I don't know, Led Zeppelin  cover band to perform.  Why would I say Zeppelin if it's a kid's party?  But whatever.  I guess you get the point.  Yeah.  Wow.  I have not seen these.  I saw the.  Jimmy and Jay.  What's that?  What is that?  It's a picture phone. 
[00:09:30]  Picture of Dice and Jimmy.  Me and Dice at the diner.  Would you Twitter that?  Jimmy looks like a little kid with his daddy.  You look like a child with your daddy.  That's funny.  It's amazing how these photos get up.  These are people I have not seen in these pictures.  Yeah.  I guess Adam Carolla's people.  There's a picture of Jay Leno meeting you and somebody else there.  There's a group of us.  And there's Jeff.  You can see Jeff Ross's head.  Yeah.  And my manager. 
[00:10:00]  And the photos of us and the wire image I've seen.  But there's like four of those.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I'm just running out of things to say about it.  Because I'm looking at these pictures for the first time.  I'm just surprised I'm not wiping.  Yeah, but it's a stage that the stage can't be more than a foot off the actual ground.  Yeah, and it's got like that shitty like indoor-outdoor carpeting on it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like an AstroTurf on top.  And Carolla was behind like you're in a yard and there's a bunch of people in front of you. 
[00:10:30]  And then there's like a 35, 40-foot rise up to the next level of his yard.  There's a huge bunch of steps going up.  And then behind me and down another level.  It's like a multi-level property.  Jesus Christ.  Is this little landing where you can overlook the valley and the mountains and see the ocean.  It's really nice.  How's the house, though?  It's probably just a shack.  I didn't see the house, to be honest with you.  He has no house.  It's just the yard.  It doesn't make sense.  Because, you know, real estate in California is very valuable, very expensive.  Yeah.  So if he has all this land, you've got to think he has like maybe just a tiny little trail. 
[00:11:00]  You didn't see his house?  I didn't go inside of it.  No.  But did you actually see the house?  Yeah.  I didn't really pay attention to it.  Which means it wasn't that great of a house.  I was too busy.  More land than house.  There was only a little bit of a press line.  And you know who blew me off?  These douches.  Access Hollywood, the internet version.  Carolla's people said, well, you might want to wait if you want to talk to these people.  And I could see the one guy who was on his BlackBerry or his iPhone, whatever he was doing.  Just make a believe you had something to do. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, and they're like, well, we're waiting for Jeff Ross.  I was like, oh, God.  Did he say, if you only knew?  No, I just, I was like, I wasn't even annoyed.  I was like, what a douchebag.  What an insult.  Like, what am I going to do?  I wasn't even mad.  The internet version of Access Hollywood.  Yeah, it's like, well, you guys, you're nobodies.  All right.  But he was on Dance with the Stars.  That's what it takes.  Oh, is that it?  You've got to get that big, that big.  Yeah, they know Jeff.  Yeah, the big push.  You've got to have that one big hit, and then you'll get internet Access Hollywood. 
[00:12:00]  It's, you know, knocking at your door.  I wanted to say to him, what could the harm be of us talking for two minutes?  What do you think I'm going to do?  What?  Fucking fruit?  Bite you?  On the internet.  Assholes.  It's tape.  This is not live at the Super Bowl.  They can humor you for two minutes.  Couldn't you just be polite?  Right.  And chat with me?  Right.  And then at least you go home and go, well, I guess they had too much stuff, you know,  that they got at the thing, so they couldn't fit mine on.  That's all.  Oh, just that.  They didn't even have to push record. 
[00:12:30]  Just ask a few questions.  Yeah, yeah.  No lights are on.  Nothing works.  And it's just like, oh, we'll entertain them.  You know what, Jimmy?  Fuck them.  Shouldn't the red light be on?  No, no, no.  We got you.  We got you.  We have the new red lightless cameras and microphones.  But it was on before.  Aw.  Did you get to talk to Jay?  Is he excited about leaving?  I only talked to Jay very briefly.  He was late.  The traffic was horrendous.  That's Los Angeles.  I know.  I even said, you know, kids, real kids, hurry up and wait. 
[00:13:00]  The whole place cracked up.  It was, the traffic was so bad, so Patton was on and he was, he actually went back on  and stretched a little bit because he had just come off.  And Jay came in.  We said hello.  He just, he hugged me when he saw me and he's like, hey, and then he just walked up  and went right on stage.  I'm busy.  We just said hi briefly and then he went, he looks very frazzled, I'll be honest.  He looks really distracted.  Wow.  He's got his last week before he moves to 10 o'clock.  When has he moved to 10, though? 
[00:13:30]  Not right away, right?  He's off for a couple months.  Oh, a couple months.  Yeah.  I think they're going to give Conan time to get settled in.  But he looked very, he said, I heard Jeff Ross ask him about it because we had,  they had us all go down for a photo while Jay was doing the podcast with Adam.  He's what a pro he is.  He goes on and it's like, it's a weird outdoor situation.  The crowd is nice, but the mic's cutting in and out.  It's like fucking no matter where you are in the business.  It made me feel better that like Leno had to deal with it and Saget had to deal with it.  Yeah.  But Jay is such a, he's smart because they were doing auctions for like stuff to raise 
[00:14:00]  some money.  So Jay said, I want you auctioning some stuff?  And then he just started doing the auction, which probably saved him the headache of having  to go through material.  Right, right.  Of course, he killed it.  It was just, it was very funny.  He raised thousands of dollars by just shaming people into bidding more money.  And like, he would just take the top two bids and go, all right, now you both go.  So he was just like doubling the money.  He was doing what you're not supposed to.  Like if something's over $1,600, he's like, all right, you're ready to go $1,500.  All right, well, just do it twice. 
[00:14:30]  Just do it twice.  Like Corolla was auctioning off a spot at his podcast to watch him.  Like go to his house and watch him podcasts.  Of course, Jay shit all over that.  What an awful gift that was.  Of course it is.  Horrendous gift.  Horrible.  But he got like, Jay got like $10,000, like from $4,500, $3,500, and $2,000 for people  just to go and look at his garage of his cars.  Wow.  Yeah, he got a lot of fucking, he raised a lot of money, man.  A lot of bucks.  Yeah, just to go look at a bunch of cars, $4,500.  Wow, that's very cool.  It was so funny.  This chick was bidding all that money and then somebody else got to go for $1,000 cheaper 
[00:15:00]  and then someone else got to go for $2,500 cheaper.  So you had to be the big shot, didn't you, lady?  I would never bid at an auction.  I would hate whoever fucking outbid me.  Yes.  I could never bid at an auction unless it was just me.  It is frustrating when somebody's bidding against you just like, ugh.  You shut up and let me have this.  I just kept raising my hand.  I had a little rolled up piece of paper, like a program in my hand, and I just kept pointing  at the auction guy.  Like the second the other guy bid, I just went, but whatever you're going to say. 
[00:15:30]  You're going to psych him out.  I got it.  I want that.  And I did.  The guy got psyched out and just went, yeah, this guy's not backing down.  What was it?  He backed out.  Pistols.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right.  Let's say hi to Fontaine in Michigan.  Fontaine.  Yo, Fontaine.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Morning.  Hey, I'm calling the rat Opie out to Jimmy.  Jimmy, did this fucko tell you what he did over the weekend?  No.  Well, you told me to stay out of helicopters, Jimmy, you know, and not do dangerous activities 
[00:16:00]  because you get a little scared when me and Ann are doing our dangerous activities.  I didn't do anything, Fontaine.  Shut up.  If it wasn't bad enough, Jimmy, he's now uploading videos on Twitter, Opie Radio, by  the way, riding a fucking bicycle with no hands, no big deal there.  Oh, that was easy.  Yeah.  Opie did a fucking big Mario impression.  At least he cried.  A fucking helicopter's flying right at his head.  Good shot.  That is, sir.  Wait, is that?  No, go with the...  That is a good one.  Is that the long one or the short version? 
[00:16:30]  That's the short.  Yeah, go to the short.  Yeah, do that one again, but Jimmy, look very closely.  The helicopter's barely above the river, if you look closely.  It's lower than the boat, and then it has to, like, pull up at the last second.  Great shot.  That's on Opie Radio on YouTube.  Did you go on?  Did you go on?  No, no.  He told me to stay out of helicopters, so now we do helicopter flybys.  Yeah.  On a boat.  You know.  Oh, you've got to cut the shit.  All right.  There's nothing else worth listening to on the radio. 
[00:17:00]  You made me a better radio listener.  All right, I tried that other shit last week on...  Hold on.  Can you go back up a little bit, Danny?  I'm looking, and I'm looking at Opie correcting himself.  It says Manhattan equals Manhattan.  Did you spell it M-A-N-H-E-T-T-E-N?  I was tired.  I think I make that mistake all the time, yeah, and I live here.  People must have thought it was my Twitter.  Yeah.  With the horrid spelling.  Yeah, they might have pointed out about 100 to 200 times.  So I said, all right, enough, enough. 
[00:17:30]  I get it.  I spelled it wrong.  Just a little helicopter fly by over the weekend.  It was nice.  Oh, that's a good one, too.  What?  This one.  This just shows just how close they...  Wow.  They just love to play, don't they?  Put a pontoon right up that bitch's ass.  Exactly.  Keeping Manhattan safe, that's all.  Yeah.  The waterway's safe.  I don't know what it is.  No, I got surprised by a boat trip around Manhattan, completely around Manhattan. 
[00:18:00]  Did you enjoy it?  Oh, my God, did I enjoy it.  Oh, my God, I had a ball.  And then we stopped Jersey City for Starbucks.  We were all over the place.  Why Jersey City?  Because they have a great Starbucks right on the water.  How do you get there from...  By a boat.  By a boat.  The boat takes you to Starbucks?  Yeah, they needed Starbucks, not me.  I paid for their Starbucks because of what they were doing for me.  Who, the boat people?  How fast that thing gets to Starbucks?  The boat people could go about 55 miles an hour on the water. 
[00:18:30]  Smooth ride, too.  Was it a private boat trip?  I call them the boat people.  My special friends, the boat people.  Yeah, the boat people.  We just keep it at the boat people, Jimmy.  Going around the Statue of Liberty and all sorts of fun stuff.  Yeah.  Helicopter flybys because, you know.  How about...  Oh, nice.  I want to say hi to my new special friends, Keith, Rob, John, Big Carl, and Tex the Pilot. 
[00:19:00]  Tex.  Oh, yeah.  Tex is...  That's nice.  Tex is all right in my book.  But what are the names?  Keith, John.  Keith, John.  Not the Keith we know.  Right, right, right.  Keith, Rob, John, Big Carl, and Tex the Pilot.  That sounds like the cast of a movie I probably wouldn't enjoy.  You walk into the wrong theater in the mid-70s and see how I'm playing.  Oh, no.  It's Big Tex.  I don't like him.  My new special friends.  We're going to do it again, Jimmy.  If you want in, let me know.  On a boat?  Yeah.  I get seasick, so I have to take pills. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  How about this?  Door-to-door service, too.  I like that a lot.  That's nice.  Door-to-door service.  They figure out where they could, like, you know, park that boat so you can get off nice.  That's nice.  No walking, no cabs for me yesterday.  I was on a boat, too, this weekend.  Oh, yeah?  Took a little boat trip to see the air show right by the Jones Beach Theater, pretty much,  down there.  Tied up with a shitload of other boats.  Uh, and, uh, watched, uh, F-18s, watched the, uh, the, the Snow Angels. 
[00:20:00]  I guess they're the Canadian version of the, uh.  Blue Angels?  Blue Angels kind of a thing.  They're called the Snow Angels?  Snow Angels.  Um, A-10 Warthogs and P-51 Mustangs.  And, yeah, that's the, that's one of the pictures of the Long Island Expressway version of the channel.  Oh, wow.  That we were going through.  Just a ton of boats on the water, huh?  Yeah, that's up on my Twitter, which, of course, is twitter.com slash anthonycumia.  Dude, stop using Whitefrog. 
[00:20:30]  It stinks.  It's whatever they put.  No, there's a way to switch that.  When I upload a picture.  I don't know.  Monday, Sunday, Wednesday.  Whitefrog, look, there's no caption.  Why are people using Whitefrog?  I'm confused.  It's just, it's an automatic thing.  I'll show you how to switch it.  Whitefrog.  But there's a caption.  And I said, it's like the Long Island Expressway out here.  Oh, how's your caption?  Whitefrog never showed my caption.  Ah.  Ah.  Ooh.  Whitefrog still.  Ah.  So we went out there and, uh, just amazing watching those, uh, those planes. 
[00:21:00]  Holy Jesus.  Air shows.  The speed of those F-18s.  And they're doing the slow flyby where they're pitched up at like 45 degrees and then they  just hit it and the thing shoots straight up into pretty much outer space.  You don't see the plane anymore.  You see a trail of smoke like a rocket ship and the plane is completely gone.  Uh, just astounding how quickly they get up that high. 
[00:21:30]  I guess there's, uh, yeah, that's one of the.  What I don't understand.  I don't understand, you were explaining the air show, uh, before the show and I don't  understand how they figure out how to do the tricks.  They probably don't want to hear that they're tricks, they're maneuvers.  Yeah.  Right in front of you.  Right in front of where everyone is hanging out.  I know.  How do they time that?  Isn't it something?  They do time it like that too.  I don't know.  I don't understand how they time it like that.  Where they get the, the two planes that pass by each other really close at full speed. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Going right towards each other.  Uh, and then they do a little break left, break right thing.  And yeah, there's, uh, one of them just going straight up.  You can see the tips of his wings are, are just going like sucking the moisture out of  the air.  It was a really cool, loud as fuck these things.  Really?  That crackly sound that comes out of these things when you're that close to them.  Uh, and then they fake out.  They got the four of them flying in a diamond formation kind of far away. 
[00:22:30]  So everyone's got like going, Ooh, look, Ooh, Ooh, look at there.  There they are.  The four of them.  And then out of nowhere, one will come tearing up behind you right over your head.  But those are the Thunderbirds, uh, really wingtip to wingtip doing these maneuvers where they  do rolls, where they're just wingtip to wingtip doing rolls.  And you got to count on those other guys to not be hung over a little tired.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Look at this.  That's six of them or four of them flying right past each other. 
[00:23:00]  Bunch of different, uh, coming from different directions.  How they do this one where it's like six planes, all in formation and they just slowly roll  over all the planes.  What if one guy and guys do that?  Yeah.  And what if one guy decides to start early and go, Oh, I thought you meant now.  And you shouldn't have been a Thunderbird, I guess, because you're blowing up two very  expensive aircraft, but that was cool.  They had, uh, some, um, Blackhawk helicopters and some of the old time biplanes that just 
[00:23:30]  are rigged up to do unbelievable maneuvers.  They throw the planes around the sky.  It just looks like you grabbed a model plane by the wing and threw it.  That's how these things fly, uh, around and, uh, coming straight down, uh, just spinning.  And you hear,  and then at the last minute they pull out and, uh, yeah, they're back on their way. 
[00:24:00]  But, uh, yeah, that's a little slow fly by.  Those are F-18s?  Yeah.  Really cool.  That's a cool video.  Would you go for a ride?  Cause Dane did it in one of the, uh, special, one of the, uh,  Torgasm he did it.  Yeah.  I think Bobby got to do it.  Would you go, I don't know if I'd go up in one of those.  I'd go up.  I wouldn't be happy about it.  Yeah.  I, I would go up in, in one of those, but I wouldn't want the guy to really like show  off and pull nine G's on me or something like that. 
[00:24:30]  Uh, I would like to take a ride and see, you know, how fast you can get up to altitude,  things like that.  I'd rather take a ride in one of those B-17s.  They had a, you know, an old B-17 from World War II, um, flying and that would be really,  wouldn't you be hoping that they kept the maintenance up though while you're up there?  Well, I think they do.  Look at that.  Old scares me.  That's guy breaking the sound barrier, like right over the water.  Wait, wait, was there something you could see physically doing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Check it out.  You could see all of the moisture being sucked out of the air. 
[00:25:00]  Is that what that is?  Dude, that is, yeah, a shockwave of, uh, uh, and the, and it makes a cloud.  It looks like almost some kind of a weird jellyfish thing that pops up on it.  Yeah.  It's like a funnel that comes off of the...  They're correcting you, Ant.  They're snowbirds, not snow angels.  Oh, snowbirds?  Yeah.  Snow angels?  I guess snowbirds sounds a little cooler than snow angels.  Better than snow angels.  They're Canadian. 
[00:25:30]  What do you want from them?  I guess they wouldn't want to be called snow angels.  It's called snow angels.  Yeah, that's amazing.  And that is loud, man.  You hear, boom!  Really cool.  Nice.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  I'd want the old lady, I'd want the old lady ride on these planes where they get up and  they just do like a nice straight out and they bank left slowly and they come back.  It's like you're in a Cessna.  A really nice, a gentleman's ride.  A gentleman's ride.  I'd like a gentleman's ride on an F-18 where you sip your coffee. 
[00:26:00]  Hold on the lid.  We're going to be going up a little bit.  Nice, slow ascent.  Look at these slow flybys they do with the gear down and the nose is pointed way up and  they're flying pretty much as slow as they can fly and still stay in the air.  And then they just goose it and go straight up like a rocket.  Why'd you turn it off there?  That was interesting.  That wasn't me.  It was somebody else's video.  A bunch of YouTube videos on the air show.  Jimmy, I can't get you a slow ride, but I could get you a ride on a fire truck. 
[00:26:30]  I would like a ride on a fire truck.  Would you like a little ride on a fire truck?  You know what it is?  I've been starting fires all over the city and just watching them and masturbating as they  put them out.  What are you crazy?  It's what I do.  I'm a fire bug.  That was great.  Don't even say that today.  They blew up a Starbucks on the Upper East Side.  I don't use explosives.  And they're looking for the culprit.  No, I don't use explosives.  I just set fires and then as the firemen show up, like old Davey Berkowitz, I sit there  and tug my penis.  I shouldn't say they blew up a Starbucks.  Davey.  But.  Fucking hate fire bugs. 
[00:27:00]  Those assholes.  Fire bugs.  They set things on fire and they call the fire.  They waste everybody's time.  Yes.  And they just sit there and watch it get put out.  Dicks.  Then they're across the street just creepily looking at their work.  Bunch of creeps.  That's how they started catching those guys, though.  Someone figured it out.  They're like, look, these people like to watch what they did.  Smells like gasoline in the crowd.  So they get a guy to actually film the crowd as these fires are burning.  Just film the front of everybody's sweatpants and whoever's leaking clear stuff.  Whoever's got a burner.  This guy just plummeting straight down. 
[00:27:30]  Does these loops.  That's one of the prop planes.  Those are loud, too, though.  And it's amazing how quickly they get from point A to point B.  Then he just does these loops and spins.  It looks like he's fucking spinning out of control.  I don't know how they stay conscious to control the plane.  They lose consciousness a little bit here and there, no?  Get a little brown out.  We're like, oh, boy.  It's called the brown out. 
[00:28:00]  Blood is leaving my brain.  They know how to breathe.  They do these breathing exercises where they push.  They go.  They sound like fucking what's-his-name, the Jew from Godfather 2.  Oh, Hyman Roth.  Hyman Roth.  They do the Hyman Roth.  But, yeah, right over the water and doing these just unbelievable maneuvers.  Look at this guy.  Just right over the water.  Jesus.  He could just plummet any time. 
[00:28:30]  I watched a little bit of Top Gun last night.  It was on late.  It's a cheesy movie.  It certainly is.  Who's the guy in the first one that couldn't pass it out and Maverick got him back?  Yeah, he certainly did.  Maverick got him back.  Cougar.  Cougar.  Cougar.  He was thinking about his family.  He lost the edge is what happened.  He lost the edge.  Wasn't that the son from the great Santini?  I think-was it?  No, the son from the great Santini was-  The one who was getting the basketball thrown off his head?  I thought that was, uh, what's his name?  It might have been. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  He was somebody.  Definitely was somebody that I've seen in movies.  Dangerous.  All right, keep it together, Cougar.  Keep it together.  I'm going to bring you right in.  Cougar.  We're running out of fuel, Mav.  I can't leave Cougar.  How come none of these fucking air guys just call themselves, like, Larry or Chip?  There's probably a Chip somewhere.  I don't know about Larry.  Hey, come on, don't do any more fly-bys, Bill.  Oh, Bill. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, it wasn't exciting enough that they had these crazy, like, jobs where they get to fly these planes.  Then they had to jack up their names, too.  I'm Iceman.  Yeah.  Yeah, why?  They have the cool nicknames, too.  I don't like you.  You're dangerous.  Wow, really?  You're going to fuck him in the ass now in the locker room after the volleyball game?  Yeah, put you up against the best.  Yeah, yeah.  Yuck.  You'll be up against the best, gentlemen.  Yeah, whenever a figure of authority calls the people below them gentlemen, that's usually the sign of a bad 80s movie. 
[00:30:00]  Is this the song where they were playing volleyball?  Yeah, this is.  Okay.  The scene wasn't gay enough.  And don't forget, Tom Cruise is actually late.  He stays to play volleyball with Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards, whatever his name is.  Yeah.  He stays there late, playing volleyball shirtless, when he could have been banging, what's-her-face?  Yeah, yeah.  The instructor.  Well, she's a lesbo, though.  But he didn't know.  Kelly McGillis.  Yeah, Kelly's a big-time lesbo. 
[00:30:30]  Kelly McGillis.  Hey, can we get Sam in here?  We've got to put the Vince McMahon story to rest finally.  What about John Stockwell?  What was he in there?  Might as well finish that up.  Didn't see The Great Santini.  Didn't see The Great Santini.  Let's see.  I don't know what he was in.  Nothing very good.  Nothing very good, right?  I've barely heard of any of these things.  He was in an episode of Friday the 13th, the television show.  Oh, I might have seen that.  After Top Gun, there's like nothing.  Corpse number three.  That's pretty much it.  He sucked.  There's nothing really going on here. 
[00:31:00]  He was so good in Top Gun, too.  I believed it.  Yeah, I believed he had lost the edge.  Yeah.  I was thinking about my wife.  Kids.  Shut up.  You're plain stupid.  Then why wouldn't you fucking land safely?  It is.  Instead of fucking aiming for the water.  Think of that emasculating bitch.  She cuckolds me.  Raw was on last night.  The boys.  And Vince McMahon went after Stan Kroenke.  Kroenke.  Well, we had called this one so early in the game. 
[00:31:30]  Well, the only reason we're following this story is because Sam got an exclusive interview with Vince McMahon.  Did you?  Because no one else wanted to talk to him about this dumb thing he's in the world with.  That's not true.  There was a big press conference, and all the New York papers were there, and the Associated Press was there, and there were cameras.  And Sam.  And everything.  And I was there, too.  Yeah.  And he talked to you over everybody else, right?  Well, yes.  And what was the beef again?  The Nuggets needed their own arena for an NBA playoff game. 
[00:32:00]  And Vince had it scheduled for a wrestling match.  Oh, yeah.  And Jimmy's line, did you hear it in the intro?  I can't do it justice.  Where there's real problems going on in the world, and they're fighting over whether to throw a ball through a hoop or do a wrestling match.  Well, I mean, he legally had the arena for the wrestling match.  Right.  So how it ended, even though he was scheduled, he had to leave town. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And find another place to do his Raw, so he went to L.A.  Right, in the Lakers stadium.  Lakers stadium, and obviously the Nuggets and the Lakers are playing in the playoffs, so this is a little slap in the face to Kroenke.  Kroenke.  And everybody in Denver, right?  That's right.  A little stick it to you.  Ah.  So Vince didn't stop there.  He really decided to rub it in during Monday Night Raw.  Last night, right?  We just knew.  Yes.  The opening of Raw had Stan Kroenke coming out. 
[00:33:00]  Why is he there?  I guess he was there for Raw, because in the front...  Why did he take the abuse?  In the front row, just like a Lakers game or something, was Jack Nicholson and the NBA commissioner and one other guy from the NBA all sitting next to each other on Raw.  How is that possible?  I don't know.  But yeah, Stan Kroenke came out, and Vince McMahon decided to come out and tell him face-to-face exactly what he thought.  Face-to-face.  Finally. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Tonight, I'm announcing the formation of a new professional basketball league.  This league will rival that of the NBA, National Basketball Association.  This league of mine will be known as the XBA.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Unfortunately, however, this league will be a miserable, total failure. 
[00:34:00]  And the reason for that is because I'm going to have you and your staff running.  How dare you, sir?  That's Stan Kroenke.  Oh, that was Stan Kroenke.  Yeah.  Saying, how dare you, sir?  That was his big contribution.  These would be great jokes if anyone remembered the XFL.  Just a bunch of kids in the eyes.  It's like the kids weren't even born yet.  They're 12 years old.  I remember.  What are you referencing here, Mr. McMahon? 
[00:34:30]  Now, was Stan and the rest of the guys there, were they big gentlemen in suits?  Probably.  Were they muscular, like perhaps wrestlers?  Stan Kroenke did appear, I mean, beyond his salt and pepper hair and mustache.  Uh-huh.  He did appear to have a youthful, somewhat youthful face under it.  Right.  Which was surprising.  Right.  I think the video is on WWE.com. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, no.  Why are you cutting my hair, Ant?  What the fuck did we do?  I don't know what this was.  What is this?  What is that?  You're in the living room in a purple color.  What do they put over you when they cut your hair?  Oh, that must have been makeup time for XFL, right?  How about we lose that video?  Wow.  Now that's on the internet for good.  It's bad enough we're showing videos from 11, 12 years ago, but the XFL stuff could be, that stuff could stay buried for her. 
[00:35:30]  Pretty bad.  Uh, Vince reveals what the E in Kroenke's name stands for.  Remember?  I'm sure he was making fun of his name so much.  No one remembers, Sam.  No one remembers.  He was crying.  This was Vince McMahon.  Why would anyone remember?  Kroenke and all that stuff.  And he said his name was E. Stan Kroenke and he didn't trust anybody.  Well, he revealed what the E stood for.  Let's talk about your name.  E. Stan Kroenke.  I've never trusted anyone with that initial for a first name. 
[00:36:00]  E.  Give me a break.  But I've done a little research and I think I know what the E stands for.  Uh-oh.  You want to tell everybody what E stands for?  These people do not need to know what my E stands for.  Now, folks, you're not going to believe this, but E stands for...  Enos.  What?  Enos.  Enos. 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  What?  What is he doing?  What is...  Vince has lost his fucking mind.  He has lost...  He has run out of things to do for his wrestling.  I love this.  For his wrassling.  Wrassle.  No, he is...  He's giving it...  He's stocking it to him is what he's doing.  Well, he certainly is.  He should have spent a total of two minutes on this thing.  Not half of raw.  Phew.  Oh, my God.  Enos. 
[00:37:00]  Enos, look at you.  How could your parents have done that to you?  Enos.  Enos, my God, there he is, folks, a life-sized version of Enos.  That's what you are.  You're an Enos.  Yeah.  You're an Enos.  You're an Enos.  He's doing the Vince impression.  What is he doing, Sam?  You're an Enos.  Steven asks for Bashar, wrestling just fucking sucks. 
[00:37:30]  What?  Come on.  He was great.  Yeah.  Out of everything going on, you know, he can't get a cool storyline going with this wrestling thing.  He has to, like, focus on this obscure thing that happened.  It wasn't obscure.  It was all over the news.  It was barely in the sports section of the papers.  Look at the dumb wig he's got on.  And he does look like one of the wrestlers that perhaps...  That's him.  Uh, no, that's not him, Sam.  Isn't that the Brooklyn brawler in a hairpiece or something? 
[00:38:00]  And look at the crowd.  It's, like, booing.  They're holding up boo signs.  Cranky fears McMahon.  Like, they really care.  Yeah, they do.  He probably doesn't realize he's making a fool out of his dad's Cranky.  Well, here we go.  And then Vince makes more jokes about his name than shoves Cranky.  Enos rhymes with, um, Venus.  Yes, it does.  You thought I was going to say something else, right?  That Enos was going to rhyme with genius. 
[00:38:30]  But we know you're not a genius, more like an imbecile, along with the rest of your staff.  But I think I figured it all out.  The problem is that you have an acute case, maybe even a terminal case of...  And let me make sure I get this right.  Enos Envy.  What?  But it doesn't matter what your name is.  All that matters is you disrespect WWE fans. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, see?  And quite frankly, you probably think that you can push around the WWE Universe.  But there's a problem with that.  You see, when you push the WWE Universe around, they push back.  Uh-oh!  And then he pushed him?  And then he pushed him, and he fell.  Oh, damn.  So he fell?  Yep.  And now what?  Is that a...  That's the end.  He's putting the wig back on his head.  Was that a wig?  Uh, yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  That's a giant wig.  And that guy is a wrestler.  That's low in the ranks.  Probably, you know, trying to make a name for himself in the WWE.  And Vince is very proud of himself for having pushed the fake Kroenke out of the ring.  That's right.  Next time, maybe, he will live up to his end of the bargain.  Right.  It's bad business.  Right.  Uh, is, did anything happen to Vince on his way to or from the ring? 
[00:40:00]  No, he ended up safe.  Oh, he did.  He actually did.  No explosions, no falling equipment, nothing happened.  He exited the ring safely.  Wow.  And made his way to the, uh, backstage area.  All right.  Good to hear.  Ah, wow.  But that's the end of that storyline, hopefully.  I think so.  I mean, it was all about, you know, last night.  Stan Kroenke signs.  Well, they didn't like him.  The WWE universe doesn't like Stan Kroenke.  No, they handed out the Stan Kroenke signs to these animals that go to these events. 
[00:40:30]  I don't think so.  Yeah, they did not.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They wouldn't spend time making Stan Kroenke signs for a wrestling event.  I would if I was in L.A. going to Raw.  They looked to see who's sitting close to the ring and said, here, can you hold this  Stan Kroenke sign?  Hold the Stan Kroenke sign.  Vince insists that we do this whole thing and none of us want to.  But maybe if we, you know, get some cool signs of the audience, it'll look all right.  I think he came across pretty well on TV.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Plus, did you get the Enos Envy thing?  Uh, I didn't get what Vince was going for eight times.  Uh, with that cheap dick joke.  He was very clever with it.  Penis!  Penis!  Really working around the word penis.  Yeah, he said, is that what it was?  David, he's brilliant.  Oh, I didn't even realize until you said that.  The old Vince would have just came out and said penis.  Yeah.  Now kiss my ass.  But now we got too many corporate sponsors, so we can't just say penis anymore. 
[00:41:30]  He should have to buff his ass and kiss it.  Yeah.  Like the good old days.  It's TVPG now.  What was it?  TVM?  Yeah.  Yeah, it should be TVM again.  Why are you still watching if it's a PG show now?  Well, PG doesn't mean it's only for kids.  It means kids can watch along with adults.  And what do you consider?  I would be in the adult category.  That could be debated.  I can rent a car.  Do you have a credit card?  Yes, I do. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, okay.  Yes, I do have a credit card.  All right.  Anthony from Vegas writes, Sam needs an Enus in his anus.  An Enus.  That's what the E stands for.  God, I wonder what that meeting was like.  All right.  Letter E.  Let's go, guys.  What can we say the E stands for?  Yeah.  Extremely stupid.  No, that doesn't work.  Evil.  Egocentric.  Yeah.  That's good.  Wait a minute.  How about penis? 
[00:42:30]  But that, sir, there's an E.  Shut up.  I'm going to say Enus.  They'll all know I mean penis.  It's brilliant, Vince.  I know.  Whatever you say, Vince.  And he ran with it.  And then he just said.  Now, one guy stood up and said, you're a bit obsessed with this dumb thing.  Shut up or you're.  He made him look like a real Enus out there, though.  Oh, Sam, of course he did.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, God.  Can you take your Vince McMahon stuff and go home for a while?  Just take your discs and leave the room.  Please leave.  Until the next Vince McMahon story.  Oh, can't wait.  There he is.  Look.  I told you this was a big story.  There he is on MSNBC.  In your face, everyone.  It's big news.  Wow.  Look at this.  It is big news.  Why are half the wrestlers in Lakers jerseys and the other half in Denver Nuggets jerseys?  And they're all white.  You know, this isn't a real team.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened there?  Oh, my God.  The big show can't play basketball. 
[00:43:30]  Why is he in the Denver Nuggets jersey there, Sam?  They did their version of the Lakers.  The good guys dressed as the Lakers and the bad guys dressed as the Nuggets last night.  How about you just watch the basketball game, which was on yesterday?  Ah, look at her face.  She was dumbfounded.  The anchor, the girl, was dumbfounded watching this.  She's a chick.  She doesn't get wrestling.  Of course not.  Dumb girl.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, not to repeat Stephen S. from Bayshore, but wrestling fucking sucks. 
[00:44:00]  It's coming in a lot.  Why is MSNBC covering it then?  Sam, you've got to give up.  Why?  We gave up.  What year did we give up?  Around 2000, I think I might have made it to 2001.  I still like Vince, though.  I love what he does.  I think it's hysterical.  Yes.  I love when Vince gets injured.  I'm not some fair-weathered wrestling fan.  No, you're not.  You've been through all the highs and lows.  Right.  You notice it's a cyclical thing.  You're waiting for it to get edgy again? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, it's going to go through a high again.  It goes in cycles.  Yeah, of course.  It was big in the 80s.  Isn't it true that they now have a pay-per-view every two weeks?  Two and a half weeks?  They do have more pay-per-views.  Remember when the pay-per-views for wrestling were?  They did one a quarter.  WrestleMania.  One a quarter.  It was like four a year.  Yeah.  You got excited for the big wrestling pay-per-view.  Then they had the big battle royale.  Well, they had the Royal Rumble.  Royal Rumble.  WrestleMania.  Yes.  SummerSlam and Survivor Series.  That was it.  And then they went to six, I think. 
[00:45:00]  They went, you know what?  Four is...  Let's do six.  Yeah, then they went like just putting Raw on pay-per-view.  No.  Yeah.  It's still a big, exciting event.  And then you fast forward.  Now they did one a month.  Yeah.  Now Sam is telling me that they have figured out a way to squeeze it so there's more than  one a month.  How...  They do like 16 a year, I think.  Here's the whole thing, though.  It was cool to watch a storyline develop over months and not be resolved until that pay-per-view. 
[00:45:30]  That's where the big payoff was.  How could you get a storyline and have a payoff after two weeks?  Because everybody knows any good pay-per-view match needs three rematches on the next three  pay-per-views with different stipulations.  No!  Yes.  Vince is just trying to make as much money as he can.  Oh, yeah.  I want to drain every room I can.  Drain the room, you heard me. 
[00:46:00]  Don't make me look like an Edith.  Wait, let me do the math.  Yeah.  Most wrestling fans, eh, they don't have a lot of money.  Is it safe to say?  Sure.  Let's do another pay-per-view.  Vince, we just did one last night.  I don't care, run another one tonight.  16 pay-per-views.  How much is a pay-per-view?  They're around like $35 a piece.  Wow.  WrestleMania is like $50.  Oh, of course.  It's the best.  Yeah.  So let's call it $30 would be $480, right? 
[00:46:30]  And then you add another $5, which is what?  Another $50, $80, something like that, right?  Mm-hmm.  So he's expecting his fans to pay $560 a year?  That's a good amount.  That's fair.  For all the entertainment, that's a lot of money for a lot of people.  Yeah.  And then we've got to go out and buy all the DVDs.  Right.  Those are $20 a piece.  And then, like you said, WrestleMania is a little...  There's a few pay-per-views that have to be a little more than the $35, right?  Well, WrestleMania is the big one. 
[00:47:00]  I think maybe some of them are a little more, but WrestleMania is...  So it's safe to say $600 a year.  Yeah.  If you're a true wrestling fan and you want to keep up on what's going on, you have to  spend $600 a year.  And you should.  Wow.  You should.  That's a lot of money.  Boy, he is raking in some cash, huh?  Plus the magazine.  Who would subscribe to a magazine?  Who wouldn't?  Sam?  Yeah.  What's the magazine thing?  It's probably...  I don't know.  It's probably...  What's in there?  What's in the magazine? 
[00:47:30]  All the latest news and pictures and...  But isn't that just...  Columns?  But is it just stills?  The coloring book.  Is it just stills of the pay-per-views?  Yeah.  Is it stills of stuff you've seen?  But no, there's columns and opinions and things.  Activity pages.  There's no...  No.  Because that's WWE Kids Magazine.  That's a different...  Same thing.  No, it's a different magazine.  No, it's all in the same magazine.  They have a kids magazine.  It's called the magazine about wrestling.  No.  That's not true, Danny.  You don't know.  There's pull-outs that you could put up on your wall. 
[00:48:00]  You don't read wrestling magazines.  You don't know.  No, you and Eric have them sent to the studio.  I've seen them plenty.  How much money do you spend on wrestling?  A month.  It's incalculable.  I don't know.  Because, I mean, you got, you know, your live events here and there, pay-per-view at  least one a month, sometimes two a month.  And then you go to all the local signings and that's...  Gotta go to all the signings.  That used to be free.  Right, right.  Yeah, no...  Now everyone needs money for their autograph.  I don't know how...  Yeah.  I don't understand that one.  Well, that's the pro wrestling retirement plan.  I mean, just go on as many autograph signings as you can because there's no retirement. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Well, when you see big stars at the...  What is it?  The Chiller Convention and all that?  Yeah.  Like...  What is it called?  Chiller...  Yeah.  Chiller Theater or whatever.  I don't understand.  Who started the, I'm going to charge for an autograph thing?  Yeah.  Was it the dopey baseball players?  One of my favorites right there.  What?  The picture of Virgil.  Virgil's wrestling superstar.  It says Virgil.  And there isn't even anyone near his booth. 
[00:49:00]  Is he sitting there by himself?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  He is, like, just sitting...  Look at this.  How much money did he make?  Virgil is a sad guy.  I met him...  There's no one there.  I met him at a signing.  And as the conversation continued between the two of us, he decided to try to keep raising  his prices.  So, like, I said, um, hey, how much is it?  And he goes, oh, it's just, uh, 15 for an autograph.  And I was, like, okay. 
[00:49:30]  And I go, okay, can I get a picture?  And he goes, yeah, sure.  And he took a picture with me.  And he's, like, okay, so that's 25 altogether.  And I was, like, uh, okay.  And he was, like, all right, who do you want me to make the autograph out to?  And I was, like, did you just say Sam?  And he goes, okay, two, Sam, blah, blah, blah.  And he's, like, all right, so 30.  What?  You must have really just looked like a sap.  Well, there was nobody on his line.  I felt bad for him.  Oh, God.  How much did you spend on Hulk Hogan?  Hulk Hogan?  Well, here's the thing. 
[00:50:00]  I got a good deal on Hulk Hogan.  He was in Armonk, New York.  Where the hell is that?  That's in Westchester.  All right.  All right.  Uh-huh.  It was $100.  To just for an autograph ticket.  And it's just $100 to get something signed.  What the fuck is this son of a bitch trying to pull?  He's got to get some.  He's going through a divorce.  He needs some money from someone.  He doesn't need any money.  Here's what I, here's the, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't get fucking charging money 
[00:50:30]  for an autograph.  But.  A hundred bucks.  These fucking baseball assholes do that.  Yeah.  What's the minimum salary in, in baseball?  They're all multi-millionaires.  I think it's about, it's about six, six fifty, I think.  Six hundred fifty thousand dollars a year.  But.  I got.  But, but those are the people that, no one wants their autograph yet.  Right.  So it's just, it's the guys that are all-stars that are charging for autographs.  They gave me two autograph tickets by mistake when I only paid for one. 
[00:51:00]  Whoa.  So right there, split in half.  Now you're talking about a pretty good deal.  And then.  Oh, are you?  Oh yeah.  And then when I got to him, I asked him to take a picture with me and he did it for  free.  So a hundred bucks for two autographs and a picture.  Yeah, but it was supposed to be one autograph.  Right.  We're going to tell him.  He's going to, he's going to shake you down for another hundred.  I want my money.  No, no.  I want my money, brother.  Right.  I got him to sign my chair.  Isn't that disgusting?  Yeah.  Hulk Hogan's charging a hundred dollars for an autograph?  A hundred bucks. 
[00:51:30]  He's a nice guy.  We've had him on the show.  We like him, but.  There is no fucking reason anyone should charge a hundred dollars for an autograph.  How much do you think Hulk Hogan is worth?  It's more often.  A hundred bucks.  With those signings.  No, I mean in life.  Oh.  He's got to be pushing what?  Fifty, sixty million?  With those signings, they usually have an appearance fee.  So where the place they're appearing at, like he was at Last Licks, which is an ice cream  slash sports memorabilia store.  The only place that size can afford to get him in there is to charge a couple of dollars. 
[00:52:00]  Right, so this place pays him whatever his fee is, and then that place is the one that  charges a hundred dollars an autograph to make up their money.  So if he charges $10,000 for an appearance, they pay him $10,000, and then they set the  prices for autographs.  And he gets none of the autograph money, he just gets there for showing up.  That's what it sometimes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A percentage.  He probably gets more.  A hundred and fifty for a sign eight by ten.  Hogan charged a hundred and seventy five to sign an item, and then a hundred bucks per 
[00:52:30]  photo.  Not at the one I went through.  It was just a hundred bucks for whatever.  Let me say hi to Nick in Maine.  It's crazy.  He points out the obvious for everybody.  Nick, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  Yeah, the reason why this is all happening like this is because, I don't remember if it  was the 70s, I think it was the 80s, when the collectibles craze started, and people  turned their whole, I mean, businesses are just surrounded by these autographs.  And it's kind of like the music industry, when you're downloading music, and the artists 
[00:53:00]  ain't making any money out of them.  Yeah.  Well, people were making tons and tons of money just on these guys' autographs, and  there were free autographs at the time.  And now these guys are saying, hey, you know what?  If everybody else is going to make money on my signature, why shouldn't I?  And that's what they're doing.  Well, that's the obvious reason, and I understand when old-time athletes do that, like, when  I see guys who played baseball in the 70s doing it, and their big salary was less than  a million bucks a year.  Yeah, you know they didn't make a lot of money playing ball. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, and all these years later, you see players making fucking 15 or 18 or 25 million dollars  a year, and there's guys that maybe made 150,000 or 200,000 back then.  Yeah.  Like, I had no problem with a guy like Goose Gossage.  I don't know what he made, but a guy like that charging photographs.  But it's like, when you're making the amount of money these guys make now, and you're still  charging, it's just gross.  But just personalize everything.  Like, a lot of guys won't sign unless they personalize.  Because that really fucks up.  You can't sell it, you know, Dear Danny.  Nobody wants to buy that on eBay unless it's fucking Babe Ruth. 
[00:54:00]  I got a Dirk Jeter ball.  I got one signed to me.  But it says Opie, so if there's another Opie out there that wants a Dirk Jeter, you know,  signed baseball, I'll give it up.  I hate the Yankees.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this thing.  Just save it in case he has a sex scandal.  Yeah, you never know.  Good idea.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Tyson's in the news.  Bad, bad story there.  And Mr. T was at a baseball game yesterday.  We got some fine audio.  Did he sing Take Me Out to the Ball Game like they do up there? 
[00:54:30]  Hell yeah.  Oh, no.  Did he have to do it his own way?  Well, he did.  I mean, a little bit.  He changed a couple words here and there.  But he's Mr. T.  Sucker, take me out to the ball game, sucker.  We'll find out next.  Wait to hear.  And can you get the laugh track ready for this story?  Man mows down traffic cop to avoid parking ticket.  I'd love to talk about that when we go back.  Jesus Christ.  We certainly will.  Yay.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:55:00]  We're getting answers to that, Dan.  No answer?  Well, you know, it's just funny because, like, the system has been the same for the last five years.  So there really shouldn't be a question about where to go to find stuff out.  So I don't know why it's...  Yeah.  I don't even know why there's questions being asked.  An issue.  Huh?  Yeah.  I don't know why it's an issue to try to find people that are in the know.  So everyone's just hiding now?  Well, no.  It's just that things...  We were promised something.  And, you know, don't promise us anything if you're going to just lie to our faces. 
[00:55:30]  Just tell us what it is and that's it.  That's it.  And then we'll have to accept it and move on.  But this, like...  This...  I guess I can't call it lying yet until we get to the bottom of it.  Yeah, we'll see what it is.  We're trying to get to the bottom of something right now.  The bottom.  We were told no one should be using the studio and that is definitely happening again.  Yeah, that's happening.  So just tell us that we're nobodies in this company and that whoever wants to could use 
[00:56:00]  our studio and then we'll have to accept that.  But don't tell us one thing and then let everyone use our studio.  Yeah.  I hate that more than anything.  Don't lie to my face.  Just tell me how it is and then we'll work around it.  What's wrong, Ed?  They're just showing on the news.  One of the news women is in a little chase lounge in the middle of Broadway in Times Square.  Well, now that's what you get to do. 
[00:56:30]  You don't have to worry about traffic in that area of Times Square.  You get to sit in a lounge chair and take in the air and take in the sights and do a little  people watching.  They have closed down.  But see, we drove down Broadway this morning because this is the way I sort of go to work  and they got a master plan because it just doesn't make sense.  I think what they want to do is they're experimenting with this.  I think what they're going to try to do eventually is just completely close down Times Square, figure  out how the traffic is going to work around Times Square and make it into this just huge 
[00:57:00]  open air mall because it's good for the economy, I guess, or good for the Taurus dollar.  You think sales kiosks are going to pop up in the middle?  Oh, yeah.  Things like that.  Yeah.  If you drive down Broadway, it just doesn't make sense.  It used to be four lanes.  Now it's two with a turning lane.  There is three lanes technically, but one is just for turning.  Yeah.  So it's two real lanes that still go through.  It doesn't make sense unless they got something else that they're thinking about doing. 
[00:57:30]  Maybe they're like sort of a Mardi Gras where, well, not even Mardi Gras, I was going to  say, you know, you go to these cities and it's all just, you know, it's just humans with  no traffic.  So at night it's going to be desolate?  Like, what?  Bloomberg's an idiot.  He certainly is.  He's so, he's completely out of touch.  Yeah.  What an arrogant motherfucker.  He wants to run for the third term.  Like, you know, he should be the one to run for three terms.  No one else should have.  Rudy shouldn't have had three terms, but Mike Bloomberg should have a third term.  Yeah, he's the guy that knows how to run this city. 
[00:58:00]  He's just a jerk.  He doesn't like the fact that his traffic plan got shot down and he's being a little  bitch about it.  That's all it is.  That's exactly what it comes down to.  We have this big traffic plan of putting tolls on the East River and no cars coming in without  10 people in them or something above 42nd Street.  He just had some goofy plan and it didn't work out.  People said no.  So now he's closing down major roadways, chunks of roadways in Manhattan. 
[00:58:30]  How does traffic hurt Broadway?  It's fucking New York.  Yeah.  Now, how are you supposed to, can, you can cross Broadway?  Is that, is that possible?  Because now people are going to be walking on Broadway.  Let me put it this way.  People are going to be walking on Broadway.  So now are people going to be able to cross with, with cars in between 42nd and 47th?  Is it something like that?  I believe that's the streets. 
[00:59:00]  So if you're on a 45th street and you cross, you want to get to Broadway, you have to be able  to cross it.  And what about these people that are just walking?  They're not going to be paying attention to walk, not, don't walk signs because they'll  probably have a cop there that's basically stopped everybody.  A cop, you idiot.  I don't know.  Because when they do these dumb street fairs where there's nothing to buy, by the way,  I mean, it's horrendous.  It's going to be a disaster.  They shut down blocks and blocks of the city for these awful street fairs.  And the same thing, they've got cops at the intersection just holding the people back 
[00:59:30]  for a minute or two every once in a while.  It is going to be a fucking disaster.  Obviously, which means they've got a grand plan because it doesn't make sense.  7th Avenue is going to be?  Dude, it stinks to funnel all that traffic and people just turning on and off of Broadway.  And by the way, what are you supposed to do if you want to get a cab?  Everyone's got to walk four or five blocks to get a cab?  Yeah, now you've got to walk to get a cab.  You've got to walk when you get dropped off if there's some place you need to be. 
[01:00:00]  Times Square is becoming its own monster.  It's becoming its own, like...  During the day, it's pretty hard to drive a car through that area anyway  because there's so much foot traffic.  It's unbelievable how many people are down there now.  It isn't bad during off-peak hours.  Now, you know, now it's just forget about it.  But you're supposed to have traffic on Broadway.  It's New York City.  The traffic, the cabs drop.  I don't think this is going to be good for businesses.  In the rain, people are going to want to walk four or five fucking blocks to get somewhere. 
[01:00:30]  It's stupid.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, bad weather.  It's going to be desolate.  Starts today.  Are you going to take a free yoga class?  You get to do yoga.  Middle Broadway.  Thank you, no.  I don't think I'll be...  You get to do a little yoga.  Doing any yoga.  They've got all sorts of events for where cars used to go.  Yeah.  Right now, it's lounge chairs and free yoga for everybody coming soon.  Oh, man.  Get the list of things they want to do on Broadway instead of have traffic. 
[01:01:00]  What did they put up there to keep people from not knowing that this is happening and make a wrong turn and just plow into people?  Because that's bound to happen.  And some old fogey that doesn't know how to work a gas or a brake pedal, my foot slipped.  And they just plow through a bunch of rubes.  Taking out tourists from 20 different states.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  All right, moving on. 
[01:01:30]  Tyson's in the news.  Very sad story.  Yes, yes.  You've got to watch your kids.  You've got to watch your kids.  What happened here?  Neighbors hearing the news for the first time are worried.  Mike Tyson's four-year-old daughter, Exodus, is in critical condition after reportedly becoming entangled in the cable of a treadmill.  Somehow the little girl got...  The cable of a treadmill.  Now, I'm thinking...  What?  I'm trying to think of treadmills.  Where's the cables?  They're pretty much in the equipment.  You could have the power cable is one, but then there are other cables that come off that you could plug your, you know, plug your iPhone into or something. 
[01:02:00]  With a video screen in the front of the treadmill.  Yeah, video screen.  There's also the lanyard that pulls out.  I don't know.  What should you get tangled in?  To humans, it's just a treadmill.  To a kid, it's just disaster waiting to happen.  Yeah, completely.  It's a spider web of death.  Yeah, yes.  How is that?  Same thing.  Same thing. 
[01:02:30]  Like, there's not even a chance that any of us would get tangled up in treadmill cables.  So what, did she choke or something?  Yeah, I think so.  The treadmill.  Somehow the little girl got something caught across her throat.  She became unresponsive.  The boy went and got the mother.  The mother came out, found the child.  Called 911 and began CPR.  Phoenix police say the girl's mother had been doing housework in another room about 10.30 this morning when it happened.  It's just really sad because the mom's very sweet and very doting on them.  And they're just lovely.  They ride their little bikes down the street. 
[01:03:00]  Riding from her house to across the street, back and forth and saying, how you doing?  The former heavyweight boxing champion moved to North Phoenix with his girlfriend more than five years ago and has lived with her and their two children since.  Just hope that Mr. Tyson and his girlfriend are all going strong and hopes that she's safe.  Again, that little girl in extremely critical condition.  It's not known how long she'd been tangled up in that court.  Now, we know that Mike Tyson was not here at this house when it happened this morning, but we are learning that he is at the hospital with his family right now. 
[01:03:30]  He's going to kill everybody.  Poor guy.  Tyson is going to kill everybody.  What do you mean?  He didn't do anything?  Well, I know, but losing a kid is, you know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know about Tyson losing a kid?  Oh, boy.  That's one of those things, though.  It's like even if you're, it's like you can't watch someone like every second of every day.  It's like that's just the thing that's in the house.  It's like impossible to avoid that type of shit.  We were talking about stuff yesterday, of course, Rayo and Sal, and my brother came over.  My brother brings the baby. 
[01:04:00]  Little Layla comes over.  But we were out back, and she's starting to kind of walk around now a little bit, you know.  Like Joe will hold her hands and then let go, and she kind of wobbles and whoa, whoa.  But my house isn't babysitting.  Like everything Joe has now is either soft or wrapped in bubble wrap.  Or rounded.  Or rounded.  All the edges are rounded.  His entire living room floor now, which is, I guess, a wood floor, is covered with these interlocking puzzle piece mat things. 
[01:04:30]  So if the kid falls down, it's not a wood floor.  They clunk their head on.  It's a mat.  No offense to your brother because this is a general statement.  Oh, believe me.  This really is a general statement.  We are raising a generation of wimps.  Superchildren, what?  I know.  I've heard that they're getting crazy with child safety, but now it's to the point where you put down your own foam.  You put foam down.  Foam flooring?  On the floor. 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  Because even until recently, like the parents were still accepting, look, if the kid falls down on a wood floor, bangs its head or something, it's just part of like, you know.  There it is.  That's Joe's living room.  Growing up.  Right now.  Look at all the rounded, cushiony couch things.  I don't even have to question this.  Joe's not a freak when it comes to this stuff.  This is the norm.  Yeah.  You get sucked up in the norm, and the norm is now that you put padding down in your living room?  That seems to be it.  I had no idea.  So they were over the house, and me and Joe were talking like, God, I remember Joe, like, remembered 20 different life-threatening things that happened to him before he was two years old. 
[01:05:30]  He almost drowned in a pool at one point out in Mastic.  He got his nose broken with a tennis racket.  Someone was swinging one around and hit him in the face.  And just various cuts and bruises and near-death experiences.  I remember choking on an ice cube, and my brother just punching me in the back, and the thing shot across the room.  But I would have been dead.  My brother being chased by the dog, going headfirst into the wall, and then throwing up from hitting his head. 
[01:06:00]  It was just like crap like that would happen.  And now everything Joe has is the dangerous stuff is up high, and everything else is rounded corners and soft.  Amazing.  And that's his floor.  That's not just a regular.  That's his floor, his kid.  That's just the thing parents are doing.  So they were over yesterday, and my house, oof, oof, we're standing in the pit area in the yard. 
[01:06:30]  You know, it's a little sunken-in area with chairs and everything that have, like, granite steps going down to it.  And he's holding her hand, guiding her up the steps, and, like, don't let go of the hand.  He goes, no, no, I'm not going to.  No, no, no, no, no.  And then he puts the little baby, you know those baby seats now that just clip onto a table, and they almost look like they defy gravity?  They just clip onto the edge of a table, and the baby's, like, on the edge.  They put that on my outside picnic table, and it's got these inlay tiles that can just flip right up and out of the table. 
[01:07:00]  So he's always, like, rocks her back and goes, ooh, look at that.  I go, yeah, maybe I ought to put it on the metal.  Wow.  Put it on the metal.  It was just, my house is so not baby conducive.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, brother Joe now plays a Nerf guitar.  Is that true, Ant?  Nerf guitar.  To protect the baby?  Yes, he can't play a guitar made of wood.  So he plays sponge guitars.  You talk about horrific injuries.  My brother Quinn, his best one ever.  We all have one, I guess, like the ones you were just saying. 
[01:07:30]  My dad was changing the twins, you know, Brett and Quinn are twins, on the kitchen counter.  And Brett is, like, just cool as could be, and Quinn is screaming bloody murder.  And my dad just cannot figure out what the hell is wrong with this kid, right?  Oh, God.  Remember the, they got rid of these a long time ago, unless you live in a real old house.  Remember, like, the heating pipes that were exposed?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Was it for the heat or for the hot water?  I'm not really sure.  I think it was the heat.  I think it was the, yeah, the steam heaters. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, but it was a pipe.  Yeah.  That was exposed.  You didn't cover this shit up.  Just a hot, steam-filled pipe.  Quinn's head was resting nicely against the pipe while my dad was trying to change him.  He's screaming bloody murder, and he can't figure it out.  To this day, he can't really get his hair cut too short.  Oh, no, really?  The hair hasn't grown back in that spot since he was a toddler.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  Nice hot steam pipe. 
[01:08:30]  Right on the back of the head.  That'll leave a mark.  I cracked my head open good when I was a boy.  Five years old.  He was an older boy.  An older boy who used to make me suck his penis.  It's true.  Same guy.  Wait a minute.  He was older.  Okay, look.  That is where your issues come from.  Why?  Because an older boy made you suck his penis.  Not my shoulder.  You should never be forced to suck someone's penis.  He was older.  He would just manipulate me.  How old was he? 
[01:09:00]  Only a couple years older, but I was scared of him.  I was very scared of him.  Did he have a nice hog?  I don't remember.  I remember.  I swear to God.  Did he come to your mouth?  No, I don't think he got erection that day.  I was like five.  I was that young.  I was maybe in kindergarten.  Aw.  And I remember he wore Budweiser bathing suit that smelled like mothballs.  It's a very vivid memory I have.  It smelled like mothballs.  Mothball.  So the smell of mothballs must turn you on.  No, I just don't.  But how did he force you?  He would just make me.  It wasn't a violent thing, but he was just older than me, and I was scared of him. 
[01:09:30]  So I remember he walked out of his house, and I just ran, because I just thought he was  going to beat me up, and I just tripped and fell and cracked my head on steps.  I had to go get stitches.  Because you were trying to avoid blowing.  Avoid.  Yes.  I don't know if I was scared of that or if I was scared of he was going to hit me.  I don't remember why I was so scared of him, but I was.  Wow.  That sucks.  A little Jimmy.  I know.  But I got a good head cracking.  Head split open.  A little fruit. 
[01:10:00]  Do yourself a favor today.  They did the famous cheese roll.  Love the footage every year of the cheese roll.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Where these lunatics try to chase, what is it?  It's a cheese.  It's a cheese wheel.  A cheese wheel.  Thank you, Ann.  Like a cheese.  Yeah, it's a cheese wheel.  You're absolutely right.  And they set it down the hill, and these lunatics try to.  What do you get if you catch the cheese roll?  The cheese, I guess.  The cheese wheel.  And the honor of catching the cheese wheel. 
[01:10:30]  The way these guys flip down this hill, just amazing.  Yeah, because it's not made for running down.  No.  It's made for falling down.  And you're under control for the first 20 feet of running down this steep hill, and then  all hell breaks loose with your body.  It's a great video.  It's all over the place today.  Mr. T.  Oh, by the way, someone.  Oh, there they go.  Look at this guy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ragdoll down the hill. 
[01:11:00]  I hope he broke something.  Yeah, Google the cheese roll for some great.  Oh, my God.  Face plant.  Is that a bitch?  Would you do that?  I think if I was younger, I would do that.  Why?  She's a kid.  The kid got it?  Dummy.  This is old.  Oh, it's old?  Okay.  Well, I mean, the footage they just showed on TV was the exact same footage.  She's face planted.  Yeah.  Lovely.  People are really surprised we didn't just beat up Tyson for that kid story.  We don't go for the jugular every single time out. 
[01:11:30]  Why would we beat him up, too?  He wasn't there.  Yeah.  Like, why aren't you making fun of that?  Well, it's, I don't know.  We pick our spots, I guess.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  There really wasn't anything to pick on him about.  I mean, Jesus, what are you going to do?  Well, give us a day.  Maybe by the end of the week, we'll have the, oh, well.  Oh, yeah.  How did a kid have Budweiser swim trunks, Jim? 
[01:12:00]  I don't remember.  Jim Beck from Florida wants to know.  Well, you don't have to be 21 to buy the swim trunks, Dumbbell.  That's true.  But that seems older than.  That's a good point.  But it does seem older than maybe seven or eight if you had Budweiser swim trunks.  No, but he was young, too.  I believe he was, I think he was one grade ahead of me or two grades ahead of him.  He wasn't older by a lot.  He left back quite a few times.  I'm sure he wasn't the brightest boy.  Gentleman of color?  No, he was a white kid.  I remember he, I remember he had a brother. 
[01:12:30]  I remember very little about him.  What a creep.  Yeah.  He's the same one that.  What a fucking creep.  He's the same one that urinated in my mouth in the pool.  What?  I never told you that story.  What?  No, but that kind of explains a lot.  Um, no.  This is where it all started, Jimmy.  Holy Jesus.  The Budweiser kid got you going down this road.  I was, uh...  Because you kind of liked that in your adulthood, no?  Well, yeah, but not from him.  No, I understand, but it had to start somewhere. 
[01:13:00]  I was, uh, in our public pool.  And, um, I guess he was making me go underwater, or I was going underwater and sucking his penis.  But then I would come back up, and he, I didn't think people could see me because I was underwater.  Like, that's the age I was at.  Like, I thought if I was underwater, no one could see me.  I'm invisible underwater.  I'm like, no, stupid.  And he fucking whizzed in my mouth, and I came back up.  I'm like, don't do that again.  And he's like, all right.  And then he did it again.  It's kind of like being here, actually.  He said it was a little more respect shown by him. 
[01:13:30]  Exactly.  He treated you better.  That's the same, that's right around the same time.  Me and my friend Tony Aquino were sitting, uh, on the poolside.  And there was a woman, uh, sitting there with her, uh, bathing suit.  I could see her pubes sticking out the side.  Yeah.  And I said to Tony, I see hairs.  And she goes, what did you say?  Which I knew, like, was a problem.  I'm like, nothing?  And Tony goes, he said he could see hairs.  And, uh, she looked down, and she realized I could see her pussy hair bulging out. 
[01:14:00]  And she's like, you little fucking pig!  And she screamed at me to leave, and I ran out.  Aww.  I had very healthy sexual messages growing up.  Now Danny's just finding pictures of women in bikinis with hair sticking out the side.  That's a little, I don't think it was that kind of bikini, was it?  No, it wasn't.  It was a regular bikini.  Don't forget, this is very early.  I was probably 1975.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember seeing a girl at a pool party with a crocheted bathing suit.  And there were hairs coming, like, out of everywhere. 
[01:14:30]  And I was so excited to look at it.  I was just like, oh.  That's strong stuff.  When you're that age, man.  God, this guy was a creep.  Yep.  What happened to him?  I hope he's dead.  I don't know.  I honestly have very little memory of anything.  Yeah, I bet.  He's got to be older.  I think he tried to fuck me in the butt once, but it didn't work.  You were his little sex toy.  I think so.  But I think it didn't work.  I have a very vague...  You can casually go, but it didn't work.  Fuck you. 
[01:15:00]  I have a really weird, vague memory of my pants around my ankles, on the steps in this apartment  building, and him trying to do that, but it not happening.  That's all I remember.  It's like peeking your head in a room and a movie's on, and then you walk out.  And you were too scared to run away?  I don't remember.  Fucking guy couldn't even fuck you in the ass, huh?  Yeah, but it wasn't abuse like, let me say, I would play monster with my friends at the  same time.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't like he was forcing me at gunpoint.  Him I remember I was scared of, but I did stuff like that with my other friends that  I wasn't scared of, but him I remember I was frightened of. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  He tried to...  I believe he did.  ...bang you in the asshole.  I think so.  It's just a very fleeting and vague memory of that.  Yeah.  Remember when we started the show, we said, something will happen.  We will give you good radio.  Here it is.  Well, that's it.  Yeah, that's all I remember.  I believe you.  I would tell you if I could remember more.  There's the cheese roll, the new footage.  Look at these lunatic dicks.  Oh.  You've got to check this out at home.  It's really worth it.  And then there's what?  If you do get to the bottom of the hill, then this guy's blocking you from the cheese 
[01:16:00]  wheel?  It looks like they're tackling you or something.  Look, your body's not supposed to turn this way.  People are getting...  How do they not bust their arms?  They should put, like, random nails in there.  Yeah.  Dislocate their...  Oh, somebody's fucked up there.  Oh.  And then they bring down the injured.  After the cheese wheel bid is over.  I've got the laughing anchor.  Oh, what a bunch of assholes.  All right.  Damn.  We're learning something about Jimmy today.  Yeah.  I wish I could remember more. 
[01:16:30]  So do I.  Oh.  Wow.  I know.  I get everybody all hot and bothered that I just want to leave you hanging.  You are a tease.  We've got a few things going on today.  Let's go to Greg in D.C.  Greg.  Good morning, b-b-b-boy.  Hola.  I wanted to call, and I'm sorry, also, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I wanted to call and let you guys know that before I was seven years old, my parents were  questioned by the police because of the amount of times I had entered the hospital due to  injuries I had caused myself. 
[01:17:00]  I had, you know, the big concrete tubes that you run through as a little kid on the playground?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I ripped my mouth open three inches because one of the tubes had a jagged edge on it, and  I tripped.  I broke my arm, jumping off the swing set, yelling, I am the six million dollar man.  He must have felt stupid.  Oh, and then I did it again about, I think it was six months later, chasing my brother  around the dinner table, trying to make him puke after dinner. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, I tripped over a big bulb that had been kicked up in the carpet.  I broke my leg.  I sliced my hand open with a hunting knife that my parents gave me.  I mean, I was just a smart kid.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, that was part of growing up.  Yeah, it was.  It was.  It was my grandpa.  When did the wimpy parenting start?  The 90s.  You think it's a year?  Can we put a year on it, you think? 
[01:18:00]  Definitely.  There's a whole article about the gap, the generations, and the line, where the line is  drawn, and it's definitely, this generation is called the millennials, and it's the, yeah,  I know, it's all the.  We didn't have car seats when we were growing up.  When was the car seat invented?  So that's probably, that's probably the start of, you know.  It was probably invented, like, in the 1800s.  You ever see some of those things that you didn't think were invented a long time ago,  but they were, but no one used them until. 
[01:18:30]  Da Vinci?  Yeah, and, like, Da Vinci invented the baby seat.  Did he invent the baby seat knowing we would eventually invent the car?  No, he'd put on horse and buggies, probably, but it was probably restraining the child by  his neck and eyes.  It was probably two nails that would go in front of the eyeballs and stop the kid that  way.  I got a great child seat story for you.  Yeah.  But if you, hold on one second, if you read anything on Da Vinci, that guy was a creep  genius.  He was inventing stuff, assuming that other stuff would be invented. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  So his invention would work.  He was the first one to put a plunger in a toilet.  It was Da Vinci.  What's your car seat story, sir?  You remember the old station wagons?  Yeah, of course.  No child seats in the back.  You just threw your kid in the back and, pray to God, they didn't get hurt.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I was two years old in the back of one of those standing up.  My dad was in the back seat telling my mom, you better slow down, you better slow down.  She had to slam on the brakes to prevent herself from hitting a car behind her. 
[01:19:30]  I did a flip and landed upside down in my dad's lap.  There you go.  Thank you, sir.  I'm getting completely killed on instant feedback and the phone calls.  You go from Jimmy's butt sex stories to cheese wheels.  Talk about ADD.  And then you got Mike D from Chicago.  And this is coming in a lot, Jimmy.  How many cocks has Jimmy had in his mouth when he was a kid?  And then John W. from Hoboken.  Let's not skip over Jimmy's line.  He was one of the boys I was blowing. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, I was sad.  And then he writes, I did not move back to the cheese wheels so quickly.  I would say nine or ten.  I told you, before I was in fourth grade, I can count nine or ten different people.  Nine or ten different people would put their penis in your mouth.  Girls, too, though.  But girls, again, there was only two girls.  Girls don't have penises.  No, I liked their little heinies, though.  And I liked their little vaginas scared me because I didn't know what they were.  Yeah.  But their heinies were nice.  What did you do with their heinies?  I remember this one girl, Janice, she was like a year older than me. 
[01:20:30]  And I was in Devil's Creek, which is what we call the stupid little woods area.  Where a lot of our sexual activities would occur.  That was a freak.  And I remember I was kneeling behind.  I have a very vague memory of Janice pulling her pants.  I wouldn't show her my penis.  I was too embarrassed.  But I can remember kneeling and putting my face on the cheeks of her ass.  And it was so cool.  That's where my ass fetish came from.  It was the feeling of the coolness of her ass.  Like, I can still have a really weird, vivid memory of the feeling. 
[01:21:00]  Like, just seeing the ass by my peripheral and putting my face against it and just gently  resting.  Did she want you to do anything?  I don't remember.  Like, tongue it?  No, no, no.  It never went there.  I think I didn't know what to do with a girl.  Again, a girl scared me a little bit.  I wouldn't even show her my penis.  Sure knew what to do with the boys.  Well, because I had one.  If someone did it to me, I don't even think I got erections at that age.  I can remember my friend's penis getting erect and me wondering, why did that happen with  his penis?  I didn't know what that was.  Because it was in your mouth?  Well, no, now I'm looking back. 
[01:21:30]  I pat myself.  I got to kind of give myself a pat on the back.  Of course you do.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking the Hoover kid.  The Hoover kid.  Hey, it's vacuum Jimmy.  Do you think it was so many other guys because the story was going around that, hey, you  could get a blowjob from Jimmy?  No, because no one talked about it.  We were all kind of...  Like blowjob club?  Yeah.  First rule of blowjob club, you don't talk about blowjob club. 
[01:22:00]  That's right.  Then I realized it was just me hurting my back, rolling down a hill, chasing a cheese wheel,  sucking my own dick.  It was...  And I can remember there was these twins.  I think they were twins.  They were a brother or sister.  Maybe she was older.  But I would get both of them at different times to sit on my face because they used to  pee their pants.  So I liked that smell.  Yeah.  And that would make them sit on my face behind the bushes so I could smell.  And the girl, I got her to take her pants off.  I know I've told this story before.  I got her to pull her pants off and see her hiney. 
[01:22:30]  And she wouldn't sit in my lap.  I'm like, well, there's some sticker bushes.  You can sit on my lap or you can sit in the sticker bushes.  And she sat in the sticker bushes.  Oh, the sticker bushes.  Yeah.  I will never forget that.  Why your lap?  Why didn't you say your face?  I was, again, I was too young.  Too young.  I was in the...  It was like a little wooded area.  We used to hang out behind...  Was that Devil's Creek?  No.  This was actually...  Devil's Creek?  Yeah, we were fucking...  You've got to get a picture of Devil's Creek.  Oh, yeah.  It scares me.  That's a place really frightening.  It should.  I go back to those old apartments sometimes and it's different. 
[01:23:00]  But I took...  In Happy Endings, in the book Happy Endings, I actually photographed the porch that Monster  Rain used to happen under.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But there was no...  I get creeped out by looking at that place, man.  Yeah?  I'd love to walk through my old...  That wooded area.  I'd go with Kenny, though, if he had his fucking weapon with him.  It just freaks me out to walk through that.  Wow.  Is it a scary woods?  I don't remember.  Yeah, what would freak you...  What, like, freaks you out about it?  Don't know.  I just feel, like, helpless there.  I guess so.  Creeped out, yeah.  Yeah.  There's no...  No weapon.  Wouldn't it be funny you go with Kenny and Kenny makes your blow-up? 
[01:23:30]  The only guy you trust.  There he is.  He's got a gun.  He points it at your head and says, suck my dick.  Holy shit.  Completely backfires on you.  I know.  Trying to get some closure by going back to this place safely.  Kenny rapes you.  That's fucked up.  Oh, and he'll get his dick in your hiney.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  Wow.  That's something.  Yeah.  That is something. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  The whole area is just, like, taboo.  Something happened to me.  Something happened.  You're blocking out.  I don't know.  I mean, I know I'm that scared of him.  What's he blocking out?  Jesus Christ.  The stuff he remembers is enough.  I can't picture the woods.  I can't picture them.  No, that apartment complex, you said.  Well, they were right next to each other.  There was Marina Gardens on the bottom, and River Heights, which is...  But you're not...  You're not willing to go back into Devil's Creek, and you're a 40-year-old man without  Kenny.  Something happened at Devil's Creek.  Well, only because I don't want to walk through the woods by myself. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know if it would be...  Most woods are harmless.  We would get from the top of where we lived, like, our apartment's on the top of the hill,  and Marina Gardens are on the bottom.  You know where it is?  It's on Route 1 in New Jersey, where it's where the old flea market used to be.  We would cross over the Raritan River on one side.  I think they're called Riverview Apartments now.  They used to be called River Heights.  And these woods would take you from one down a hill to the other, from what I remember.  Down a little, yeah, into the woods.  Just don't remember how it opened up, or... 
[01:25:00]  They're making a new movie, though, with a bunch of kids.  And a bunch of kids, based on this story, it's called Kneel by Me.  I knew you had a good one.  You were very excited.  I thought it was going to be the Blair Bitch or something.  Blair Bitch Project.  Well, I'm sure the listeners have a few.  I'm sure there could be some movies about Devil's Creek.  And, yeah, it's like a Stephen King type of... 
[01:25:30]  Devil's Creek.  That's what they call you, you know.  A Stephen King movie location.  I believe that's what we called it, yeah.  Oh, man.  But it wasn't...  I don't even know if it was a creek.  It might have been.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just...  Now I remember a piece of plywood.  Look at that.  I think...  Dan is finding their area.  Oh, cool.  Danny's pulling it up on Google Map Images.  He's like, he's around there.  It's a fucking photo from 25,000 fucking feet.  Yes, it is on Earth, Danny.  Go closer. 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  It is Earth.  Could you get closer or I can distinguish what's a road and what's fucking mountains?  Is it by a highway?  Yeah, is this it right here?  It's like a fucking...  A shrub taken from fucking Jupiter.  I don't know.  I want to find Devil's Creek on Google.  I can actually see the moon in the foreground.  The fuck do I know if that's it?  Ooh, take it to street level.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Well, that looks a little new.  That looks...  That's very...  No, no.  That doesn't...  Go to River Heights Apartments...  Riverview Apartments. 
[01:26:30]  I just don't remember.  Anyone that lives in that area, there's a winding road that goes down from one building,  one apartment complex, and it goes down, winds down in kind of an S into Marina Gardens.  There is a creek.  Or a river.  Well, that's the Ratton River.  That's fucking huge.  Oh, that's a river then.  Okay.  That's not Devil's Creek.  So we're not talking about the river, right?  No, no, no.  Not the Ratton River, no.  So it must have been something that...  An offshoot off of that, probably.  Offshoot of the river, yes.  If it was a creek, I don't remember it being a creek.  A creek. 
[01:27:00]  I don't want to do anything else.  I just want to find Devil's Creek.  I want to see it now.  Can we take a little, like, what do you call it?  Field trip?  Discursion?  We've got to do a field trip to Devil's Creek.  I don't even know if you can walk through it anymore.  I just don't know.  Devil's Creek.  It's not called Devil's Creek.  Officially, we would call it that.  All right.  Well, that looks a little creepy.  Go to Fox...  Go to find us...  I'll tell you my old address.  I used to live at 66 Fox Road in Edison, New Jersey.  That's where I lived when I was a boy.  I don't remember the apartment, but that was the actual address. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  So now...  Pop that up.  Yeah.  Danny's got a new old house.  Now walk us...  Yeah, walk us to Devil's Creek.  Come on.  Yeah.  Using...  All right.  Wow, yeah.  That's my old apartment complex, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Oh, look.  There's Jimmy blowing someone.  Yeah.  No, all you see is...  How long ago are these taking?  All you see is a porch, and there's two little feet sticking out from under it  with the toes on the ground, and you can see the little toughskins getting shame dirt  on the knees. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, shit.  Wait, you're not a boy in that picture.  Yeah.  Jimmy, what is that?  There's a Saturn park there.  There's a tranny.  Okay, go...  Now, where's Fox Road?  Right there?  Go this way, down this way.  All right.  And wrap around here.  He's turning.  He's making a...  And there's Fox Road.  Wait, hold on.  Let me see which way we go.  Okay.  Do I have the right perspective?  I think it would be this way.  All right.  He's going back around.  It's a very windy road.  Hold on.  There's the S going down to the apartments down there.  So go back up.  Go back up. 
[01:28:30]  It was...  I want to say this way.  In this area here.  I'm circling this area here.  I just can't get the right perspective.  Oh, no.  That looks very wooded.  Yeah, there's no creek in there.  But you see the woods?  It went through there somehow.  It's a lovely dock and deep.  It went through there somehow.  Is that a creek right there?  Maybe there was like a little...  That's off of the river.  Look, that's a creek.  Maybe that's what we named the woods after.  Yeah, yeah.  I just don't remember.  But I'm almost positive that right up here, up to your right, there's like a little... 
[01:29:00]  You can see where Fox Road turns.  And then we used to hang out.  I'm showing him behind these apartments.  This is all a hill going down.  Zoom up a little bit.  Zoom in.  Could you zoom in?  Take a look.  Keep zooming.  Yeah.  It's right up in the top of here is the entrance.  Really?  Oh, look at this.  Yep.  Wow.  Holy shit.  The fucking Google...  Could you go higher, Danny?  To the top of the hill?  Isn't Google like really fucked up when you look at what they've done now?  Yeah.  It's fucking...  Sir Paul McCartney actually had Google block the view of his house. 
[01:29:30]  Really?  Okay.  Yeah.  If you punch it up, it shows a black screen.  It says, this image has been removed.  Can you do that?  For security reasons.  I guess you can.  Yeah, he's McCartney.  I don't blame him.  It looks a little bit different.  Now, can you show from the other angle we're looking back that way?  That's it right there.  That's the entrance right there.  Right there?  Yep, right there.  It used to be bricks.  It says...  They used to be red brick.  It says Valley Manor Apartments.  And you'd walk in around the back here and then go into the woods that way.  Is that where you parked a DeLorean if you went back in time to hide it from people? 
[01:30:00]  Wow.  That's where we would enter.  Wow.  But that was red brick back then and it didn't say Valley Manor.  It was called Marina Gardens.  Do you remember that speed limit sign?  Was that there?  No, I don't remember any of that.  All I remember is you see to the...  Where are you looking?  I'll show you where we used to walk in.  I'm just looking down here.  So we would enter right there.  So where's Devil's Creek from there?  You would enter right there and Jimmy's pointing at his mouth.  And we'd walk right around that and go into the woods.  Wow. 
[01:30:30]  That's fucked up, huh?  Are you just looking at that shit?  Dude, it's amazing.  This is...  Ten years from now, that's going to be all fucking hologram.  You're just going to talk about it and it's going to appear in front of you.  It'll be right in front of you.  You can walk through it.  The holodeck.  Steven S. from Bayshore, what about Lord of the Open Flies?  That's a good one.  There you go.  Game on.  Yeah.  Oh, we've got to find Devil's Creek.  This little child movie.  Again, I don't remember the creek itself.  It's just the woods.  The woods.  I remember walking back through the woods.  So if you went back there, you would have to go right past that sign and walk through there. 
[01:31:00]  And you wouldn't walk through that by yourself?  Again...  At your age?  I'm 40 now.  I probably have not been back there since I was...  It's probably been at least 28 years.  How long have you been?  Maybe 30 years.  There'll be a bunch of guys out there with the dicks hanging out going, we've been waiting  for you.  Yeah, where the hell you been?  Where you been?  Bunch of guys with long Methuselah beards.  It's no fucking tone.  I don't remember, but I don't know what they're like.  You know how sometimes you go back to an area that used to be wooded and now the apartments  are bleeding into it and you can kind of go out... 
[01:31:30]  Like from one end, you can now see through to the apartments on the other end.  Right, right.  Let's have Kenny gas up the car.  Let's go to Devil's Creek after the show today.  I don't know, dude.  After the show, I'm going to be right to Edison, New Jersey.  I'll sleep.  There'll be nothing there.  We'll all be like, what the fuck is this?  What happened?  We're just in the woods.  Yeah, a bunch of men.  Jimmy, blow me.  I would hate that.  You guys would tell.  I know.  That was the big thing.  Don't tell.  Don't tell.  Don't tell.  Of course, that's the big thing.  Don't tell.  Rapper T.I. 
[01:32:00]  reports to prison today.  Let's say hi to Lydia.  Lydia.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Lydia's on the line.  Lydia.  Hi, guys.  I couldn't help but call him.  Jimmy.  Aw.  What?  I think you should definitely take a field trip back to Devil's Creek.  Well, again, I've driven by it many times.  I love the name.  Yeah, it was awful.  Fantastic.  Devil's Creek.  I was thinking we had a cool name for the woods.  I think it was just the woods.  Fuck.  Devil's Creek. 
[01:32:30]  We had the corral.  The corral.  Nice.  What, Lydia?  I think Jimmy definitely has to do a walkthrough.  You've grown up now.  It can't hurt you.  No, I would walk through.  I just don't know what kind of kids are back in now.  I don't know if the apartments still have the same clients living in them, the same tenants  living in them, or who knows if it's changed.  Maybe it's government subsidized housing.  Now I'm going to get fucking piped over the head.  That could be.  I'm not afraid of a monster.  I'm afraid of a monster in a crooked hat.  I think Devil's Creek no longer exists because there's no little boy, you know, crying. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's all dried up now.  I think it's the tears.  Oh, you like your cleavage picture?  Yeah, we just popped that up so we could get a visual of you.  The only important part.  It makes it so much easier to listen to your dumb voice.  Those mammoth teats.  I got to tell you, that sex thing sells, though.  This dumb picture did very well on Twitter.  I did it?  Yeah.  Did it?  I guess I'll have to become one of your followers, Opie, if I want to see my cleavage. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  The comments are brutal on your cleavage.  What they want to do to your cleavage there, Lydia.  Maybe I don't want to become a follower then.  So you're feeling bad for Jimmy and his Devil's Creek thing?  Yeah, right.  I really wasn't going to call today.  I was just going to listen.  But then I heard all of Jimmy's, you know, revelations.  I've told some of this stuff before.  I just don't remember a lot of it.  Well, you never told the hiney one where the kid tried to put his penis in your hiney.  Yeah, it's a very fleeting memory.  Yeah, fleeting. 
[01:34:00]  You don't remember, like, a limp noodle brushing up against your butt cheeks?  I don't remember if it was limp or not.  I just don't remember.  You just couldn't get the job done.  Yeah.  Maybe because you resisted.  Maybe you're like, you know what, dude?  You know, the blowing is one thing.  But you know what?  I'm not doing this.  But this is how stupid we were.  I would sit, like, you walk into the hallway, and it's like you have his apartment, and then  you walk up a little flight of steps and make a right and go up a couple more steps, and  there was the upstairs apartment.  We would sit three steps up.  We would, like, from his door.  Like, if you open the door to walk into the hallway, you could just see us. 
[01:34:30]  You could see him trying to have sex with you.  Yeah, but there was a creaky step that would walk up, like, which you'd hear, so we always  heard when someone was coming, because they were metal steps.  Ah, hmm.  And I remember my one friend, I was sucking his penis, and we got caught by another friend.  And then what did the other friend do?  I was so embarrassed, I ran up the steps and made the right and went by the other part,  but, like, I just ran.  I don't know what to do.  You had to grow up way too fucking soon, man.  That, and the fact that you're running away shows so much shame. 
[01:35:00]  Of course.  Oh, Jimmy.  You had to grow up way too fast.  It wasn't like that.  Oh, Danny, you son of a bitch.  Danny just popped up some guy fucking another guy in the ass.  Some guy in a Dracula cape trying to fuck his mouth.  A little fun after the old Halloween party.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, I definitely think you should bring Kenny to the woods with you,  and master your fear, Jimmy.  I'm not even that afraid of it.  It's just creepy. 
[01:35:30]  Like, you know, I don't have a phobia of it.  It's just creepy.  I don't blame you.  I'd be creeped out too by a place where I was abused and changed.  But you know what I say?  Have fun.  I don't know about abused.  Again, I was never, I volunteered for a lot of it too.  I can't pass it off as, you know, it felt good and I did it.  It was his fault.  Yes.  You should have seen me in those shorts.  Who could resist?  You were always to blame.  Jim Sharkey from Fairfield, Connecticut writes,  On Golden Pond seems curiously appropriate. 
[01:36:00]  You were always to blame.  You must have had a lot of blue paint on you, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Let's talk about the day we went to Devil's Creek.  I'd show up at Mr. McGregor's with paint on me.  He'd be like, I know, I see.  It's on you.  Did you have to wash the blue paint off in Devil's Creek?  I don't remember, dude.  So with all those penises, did anyone ever come?  No.  Not to my knowledge at all.  Wow.  They're calling the movie The Bloonies. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  That's funny.  See, you asshole.  That's funny.  If you listen to feedback from a cell phone, you've got to put your name somewhere.  You don't get no credit.  Bloonies.  The Bloonies.  All right.  That's a funny movie.  I think you've got a new message board name or a new Twitter name.  Bloonies.  Oh, that's funny, whoever you were.  Good luck with that, Jimmy.  Thank you, Lydia.  I'm okay.  Lydia, very good appearance last week. 
[01:37:00]  Very good appearance.  Oh, thank you.  It was my pleasure.  I really had a lot of fun.  All right.  We'll see you soon.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Let's do a little backstage with Lydia.  I like this thing from last week.  Because we take a break.  I'm funny.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  And Lydia, the middle school therapist who regularly calls in to the O&A show, stopped by to meet the guys in person. 
[01:37:30]  She ended up yapping for over an hour.  And we grabbed her after her appearance to find out what she thought of the guys.  Lydia, now that you've met the guys in person and you've had a lengthy conversation with them,  what's your analysis of Opie, Anthony, and Jim?  I think they make an excellent team together.  But, boy, are those guys fucked up.  What are their problems individually?  Like, what's Opie's issue?  Opie's probably the hardest one to figure out because, on the surface, he has the most normal-looking life.  But I think everyone knows about Opie's anger issues. 
[01:38:00]  I mean, he is the one who told me to suck a big black dick when I suggested psychotherapy.  So you think he's harboring a lot of issues?  I guess growing up in a family so big it must be hard to be heard.  So he's certainly figured out his way to be heard by millions of people every day.  After filling us in on Opie's anger, Lydia confided with us that she was worried about his co-host, Anthony Cumia.  You and Anthony got into some stuff.  What's your analysis of Anthony now? 
[01:38:30]  You know, I think that Anthony's a great guy, but I do really worry about him.  I was very serious about that, all joking aside.  I worry about him isolating himself.  I worry about him identifying with the aggressor.  I know he was beat as a child.  I know that's why he likes guns and control.  And I just sort of worry about what's going to happen over at Casa Cumia one day.  Do you think the story of Anthony could end in tragedy?  I hope and pray not.  And after all this time, she struggled to get to the root of Jim Norton. 
[01:39:00]  What do you think is going on with Jim?  Jesus, I don't even know where to start with Jimmy.  He's got well-documented sexual issues.  Do you have any ideas where those might come from?  I don't know.  You know, I think that Jimmy really feels pretty bad inside about who he is.  And he's working that out.  When you want someone to pee on you, you know, you want someone to pee all over you for a reason.  So he's the typical sad clown, laughing on the outside but crying on the inside?  That's a nice way to put it, Sam. 
[01:39:30]  Thanks a lot.  Wow, Lydia.  Thanks for reminding us what a tragic and pathetic group of people we are.  Oh, well, back to abortion jokes.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with O&A.  Opiate Anthony for a Monday.  So far, so good.  Oh, no, it's a Tuesday, right?  It's Tuesday.  That's it.  Oh, how great is that? 
[01:40:00]  It's nice.  How great is that?  Thinking it's Monday, but it's Tuesday.  Not as good as thinking it's Thursday and it's Friday.  Yeah, but I'll take this one.  We just fast-forwarded 24 hours, my friend.  We work.  A.S., New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I live about five minutes from the elusive, infamous Devil's Creek.  Oh!  If Jim wants some pictures of the area, if I can find it, to stroke his memory, just mention  so on air, I can't guarantee any boys and bud boxers will be out at this hour.  Dr. A.  Check it in.  Yeah, Jimmy, we'd all love to see a picture of this scary Devil's Creek. 
[01:40:30]  I want to see Devil's Creek.  I'm frightened.  Don't be...  Jimmy did say that he wouldn't go back there unless Kenny went with him.  Just because...  It's more because I just haven't been there.  I don't know what type of folks hang out there anymore, and I could be walking, you know,  a bunch of fucking weirdos doing drugs or...  True.  Homeless animals or something.  Who knows, right?  Who knows?  People there sucking each other's penises.  It's a real haven for dick suckers, apparently.  It's just an evil place. 
[01:41:00]  Anybody following the NBA playoffs?  Just a quickie here.  Is that a...  You got the Nuggets...  Basketball?  Yeah, you got the Denver Nuggets beating the Lakers 120-101 series tied at two.  NBA getting very nervous right now.  Why?  They really want LeBron versus Kobe.  They want Cleveland versus the Lakers.  Yeah.  And it's not working out that way so far.  Not so fast, Denver's saying.  Not so fast, Orlando's saying.  If it's Orlando and the Nuggets in the NBA Finals, they will lose millions of dollars. 
[01:41:30]  I am surprised they're still playing.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, how long do these playoffs last?  Into June.  And then the game.  Into June.  And they start in, what, October?  Yeah, well...  It's crazy, right?  It is.  It's like I always say, life is what happens when you're making other plans.  John Lennon said that.  No, I said that.  He said it.  And did you ever watch the Indianapolis 500 growing up?  Yes.  For some reason, I remember that being kind of cool to watch as a kid, but... 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, when there were, you know, 13 channels on your TV.  Not so much as an adult.  You just watch...  Yeah.  Isn't it all about NASCAR now?  No, some people are still very much into Indy.  Do you even know who won?  Could you even name one Indy driver?  Emerson Fittipaldi.  I'm going way back.  Could you name one Indy driver?  Rick Mears.  Harry Chapin.  His body was Indy of his head.  Jane Mansfield. 
[01:42:30]  Jimmy Dean.  I bet you between us, we can't name one driver.  I certainly can't.  I would just say Andretti.  A.J. Foyt Jr.  I would go with an Andretti's got to be racing.  But it's got to be some, like, grandson.  Mario Andretti Jr.  No.  It's got to be past Jr. at this point, I'm thinking.  Ah, really?  I don't know.  That old?  I don't know.  Actually, so some dude won the Indy.  I know of one driver.  Oh.  Yes.  Really?  It's true.  Yeah? 
[01:43:00]  I wonder who that is.  Ted Sheckler.  Ted Sheckler.  He is.  He drives Indy cars?  Sponsored by GasX.  And Kaopectate.  It's nothing but nervous stomach products pasted all over his car.  The inside of my car smells like spoiled meat.  I get very frightened going that quickly.  Everybody's going faster than me.  I'm beeping.  Everybody's slowing down.  Do you have a horn on your Indy car?  I certainly do. 
[01:43:30]  I drink coffee.  And I let out little quiet farts.  The pit crew hates it.  They say my car smells like spoiled meat, Gregory.  I like that the car is sponsored by nervous stomach stuff.  Just nervous stomach stuff.  All over Pepto-Bismol.  Would you want to be the driver of that car?  No.  Sponsored by nervous stomach products.  Nervous stomach products.  Kaopectate.  Pepto.  Pepto.  A little GasX. 
[01:44:00]  A little GasX.  That's wonderful.  Sometimes I leak into my racing slacks.  I wear dress shoes.  That's dangerous.  I wear a tuxedo.  You should be wearing some kind of flame retardant suit.  Sometimes my top hat blows off immediately.  Why would you wear a top hat?  Why wouldn't you?  Everyone else wears the helmet.  The helmet.  Exactly.  I don't like that.  I don't go above 55.  It's dangerous.  But you're not going to win.  And you're just going to be in everyone's way.  But I say, who could do more laps? 
[01:44:30]  So after the race is over, I continue driving and declare myself a winner.  Ted Sheckler's an idiot.  He really is.  I pull over very quickly.  I single when I'm going into the pit crew.  You have blinkers?  10 o'clock, 2 o'clock.  10 o'clock, 2 o'clock.  He's a very safe driver.  Oh, Danica Patrick.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you to John in Jersey.  That's right.  How did she do?  And is there an Andretti racing still?  And the guy who won... 
[01:45:00]  Nigel Mansell.  No, you read that.  Of course I did.  The guy who won...  I don't know his name or anything, but he won his third in a row.  So that's all you need to know.  Third in a row?  Celio Castro Neves.  Wow.  Something like that.  Speaking of sports, Mr. T.  Oh, here's a good little game we can play.  You're good with the TV trivia, right?  Yes, I try.  All right, let's see how good you are today.  Mr. T.  Mr. T.  Cubs-Pirates game? 
[01:45:30]  Cubs-Pirates.  Gets to go on the mic.  What would Mr. T say at a Cubs-Pirates game?  Cubs are the home team.  Cubs-Pirates.  What would he say?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I think I know.  For real?  I pity the Pirates.  Give yourself a bell.  Give yourself a bell. 
[01:46:00]  Hold on.  I pity the Pirates.  That's right.  Oh, no, he didn't.  Yes.  Oh.  Go, Cubs, go!  I pity the Pirates!  Oh!  Oh!  Ryan does this constipated Mr. T noise.  How many catchphrases?  Look, I'm all about the catchphrase, but even I realize when you've got to move on from certain  catchphrases and try and do one.  When some aren't catching on?  Oh, good point.  At least he moved on eventually. 
[01:46:30]  At least he had one, I guess.  I pity the fool.  There you go.  See?  That was an easy quiz.  He pities the Pirates.  Did you ever have a catchphrase that didn't catch on?  How about every single one?  It's an ongoing bit with this show.  Brother Man, Brother Man.  Brother Man was one.  Never took off.  Really.  Mother Hucka.  Yeah, that one never took off.  Which I stole from We, so it wasn't even mine.  What are some of those other catchphrases?  Well, the catchphrase we got.  Oh, well, the Real Rock TV's filled with a bunch of them. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, they certainly are.  I was really hoping for the, yeah, yeah, yeah, dude man, dude man was another one.  You never said that as a catchphrase.  Hey, dude man.  Dude man.  Hey, dude man.  You never said dude man.  Oh, we got crying.  Why wouldn't he?  Helio Kostroneves was crying his eyes out after he won the Indy 500.  Oh, we should get that then.  Yeah, in the winner's circle, if we could find that down the hall.  I thought it was, oh.  What?  Oh, come on, Jimmy. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, wow, that wasn't a bad one.  Yeah.  He was ready to spit out, and then he goes, I'm, I'm, I'm.  I was going to say, I thought the race was won by Helio, um, and he spoke in a really  high voice.  I immediately caught myself.  It was won by, boo, ooh.  Someone's asking.  Nobody caught himself.  He can't give him a car crash for sharing a bomb.  Nah, I just bombed him.  He could have kept to himself.  Rob, Long Island. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, Derek and Patrick finished third.  Remember the Indy commentator, Jackie Stewart?  The drivers have going around the track and driving the cars and driving.  I love Jackie Stewart.  Jackie Stewart used to do a commercial for, uh, um, for Hot Wheels.  Those cars really hug the road.  At them.  This is down fire.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he still doing it?  No, I think Jackie Stewart.  He's got to be dead, right?  He has to be.  I'm Jackie Stewart.  Look at how those cars really hug the road. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I remember him.  $8,500 was a big deal when we were growing up.  Rick Mears was the big driver when I was, uh, watching.  The Pennzoil-Penski team.  All right.  And then more Mr. T, uh, well, he got to sing the famous Take Me Out to the Ball.  Oh, that's fun.  Because that's what you get to do if you're, uh, you know, the guest for the day at, uh,  the Cubs game.  All right, Cubs fans.  Let me hear it.  A one.  A two.  A one.  A three.  Take me out to the ball game. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  Take me out with the crowd.  Buy me some peanuts and crack good jacks.  I don't care if I never get back.  Let me root, root, root for the Cubs thieves.  If they don't win, it's a shame.  Boys, one, two, three strikes you out. 
[01:49:30]  It's a all-ball game!  Go, Cubs, go!  Go, Cubs, go!  It was fun as he was singing Peanuts and Cracker Jacks just to change the foods.  That was awful.  I think he did not hit one note.  No.  Properly.  Kyle S. from Indiana.  Take me out with a shotgun. 
[01:50:00]  Cigars and scotch.  That's a good one.  Stay in school.  Here we go.  Ready?  Let's see.  There's two Andrettis still racing.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, A.J.  Foyt, the fourth.  Holy shit.  A.J.  Foyt, the fourth.  Wow.  Thank you, Will Corr from Jersey.  Uh, people are begging for the Ted Bit Animated as the race car driver.  That would be hysterical.  Marco, Marco. 
[01:50:30]  Wait, now what do we got?  Blinker going on while you pull off the pit.  He's trying to pull into the pit stop.  His pit crew has got clothespins on their nose because of the smell of rotting meat.  Yes, Ted, yes.  You know, sometimes my pit crew will make me one of those charcoal underpants.  Supposed to make your farts smell better.  I just get very nervous.  I hear, blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, pfft.  I fill up my slacks.  I sharted one time by the third lap. 
[01:51:00]  Big Tums sponsors on the front.  Yes, Tums and K.O. P.T.  He has a sour stomach.  God, I love that.  He has a sour stomach.  Yes.  He's got cramps.  I'm lactose intolerant.  I drink a big thing of milk before I race.  I don't know why.  Well, it's a tradition that the winner actually downs a whole big thing of milk in the winner's circle.  Oh.  So that would be very bad if you were lactose intolerant. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, you'd have to take some lactate or something before.  But there are sponsors, so that's good.  I don't like racing wheels.  They're too big.  I like regular.  I ride on donuts.  Four donuts.  My pit crew's always yelling at me.  They're like, Theodore, you're losing badly.  I'm like, it's about endurance.  They're like, Ted, you're down by 378 laps.  I'm like, patience, my good man.  I don't know how he ever got picked to be the driver. 
[01:52:00]  I'm very good.  Oh, you are.  I am.  Two Andrettis.  I don't see it.  Ready for this?  You got Mario's nephew, John, and his grandson, Marco.  Keeping it in the family.  Yeah.  That's how all those guys get into racing anyway.  Of course.  It's all nepotism, especially NASCAR.  There's a lot of that going on.  Helio also won Dance with the Stars this year. 
[01:52:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Hell of a...  Rudder?  Who cares?  That's fantastic.  God, do people love Ted.  They do like him?  Oh, they just love Ted Sheckler.  I can't tell.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Ted's a weird boy.  No, Ted's fine.  You're a little weird.  Why don't you go to Devil's Creek?  Yeah, I have a feeling Uncle Paul lives in Devil's Creek. 
[01:53:00]  Ted talks a lot.  He's a towel-taler.  Oh, he's a big-time towel-taler.  I remember Mr. and Mrs. Sheckler asked me to watch him.  He told all these lies about what I did to him.  I don't like Uncle Paul.  He's creepy.  Why don't you like him?  I don't remember much, Gregory.  All I remember is he called me into the room, and I felt the pillow on my face, and then  I woke up, I was in a hospital.  I think I fell.  That's what Mother told you? 
[01:53:30]  Mother told me I fell down and landed on something.  A skate went into my hiney repeatedly.  Thank God Uncle Paul was there.  He drove me.  I bet he did.  That's wonderful.  Dropped me to the hospital.  Imagine being blessed by Uncle Paul.  And your parents have no clue, so they tell Uncle Paul they're driving to the emergency room.  Of course.  He fell down the steps, and his skate went into his hiney. 
[01:54:00]  Rolled the skate.  Repeatedly, he said.  Yeah, apparently so.  There was some kind of tapioca on the skate.  Got all over little Teddy's backside.  Little freckled backside he has.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That Teddy sure was cute.  Must be why he has such a nervous stomach.  Yeah.  He would always do that.  He would always.  I'd come in and tuck him in.  I'd hear.  Smell like sprirled milk.  Sprirled.  Sometimes I couldn't even keep a heart on. 
[01:54:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, that was Ted's defense.  His own Paul's advances.  Like a skunk.  Yeah.  Yeah, that check was like a skunk.  All right, what happened?  I was here.  As the door was opening, he might hide it.  He would just start firing out bombs.  Let's say hi to Mike in Arizona.  Mike, help us out here, please.  Hey, going back to the Mr. T clip, as painful as it was, did he say root, root, root for the honkies? 
[01:55:00]  Oh.  It was home team, but it could have been honkies.  Maybe honkies.  Hey, honkies.  Speaking of singing, who's this?  Hey, night, the sound from the papers, has a moment so merry that she is smiling on board.  Um, I know. 
[01:55:30]  In the lab light.  Is it fat Will Ferrell?  I've never placed her legs at my feet.  Who?  Susan Boyle.  Give yourself a bell.  I don't have a bell.  Give yourself a bell.  That's Susan Boyle?  Yeah.  She's not very good.  We kind of forgot about her, but she's in the semifinals, I guess.  That show's wrapping up.  That wasn't very good, though.  She's got talent?  Well, now that you know the monster's singing it, it's very good.  That's the problem. 
[01:56:00]  Every street I've seen.  It's like a picture Kong hanging off the building, singing this, gesturing to the city.  She's still in it, I guess.  Oh, obviously she's still in it.  With the fake cuts and fake enthusiasm that this show has.  And Simon's shocked face. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  I can't believe it.  Oh, she's a fucking pig and she's singing.  I can't believe they're choking my ex-girlfriend.  Yeah.  What was that, the American Idol finale they got to Simon's girlfriend?  Some crazy lady, yeah.  Hey, do we have the story about the Chinese dude?  It's coming in a bunch.  Do we have that already?  Yeah.  Oh, we do have it.  Okay.  Thank you, John Hayden.  It's a little vague.  Chinese dude.  Well, I didn't want to give out the punchline.  Ah, good. 
[01:57:00]  So I wasn't sure if we had it, that's all.  All right.  Let me see if I got it.  I wonder what this Chinese dude did.  See, I got you.  What kind of driving mishap story are you getting to?  Look, it's just showing Times Square now.  With people, like, standing in the middle of it just because they can.  Yeah.  Look at these fat fucking rubes.  Brim it over here.  Just taking up, taking up space.  Well, I don't know.  Steve did the prep today, so probably not.  Tables, lounge chairs.  Oh, just, oh, man. 
[01:57:30]  Just somebody.  Some old fogey loses control of their bowels.  Yeah, I don't have it here.  I can't read.  I'll have it.  Yeah, we'll put it out.  How do you get to the Marriott?  You don't.  Practice.  Oh, that's, that's Carnegie Hall, dude.  Trying to go for a great place.  Oh, you don't need, you don't need practice to get to a hotel.  See, here's what I'm thinking.  You, you, you want to go to the Marriott, you want to go to one of these hotels that  are in Times Square.  Are you now supposed to drag your fucking luggage? 
[01:58:00]  That's a good question.  Uh, uh, seven blocks, or, or three blocks, whatever it is.  No, because I'll bet you can cross, I'll bet you can cross on the side streets, like  you said.  You can probably cross over 46th, 45th.  Yeah.  But again, that's going to murder traffic.  People trying to get to the airport, to the hotel.  That's right.  That's going to be very difficult.  This is the start of something big.  He's got something up his sleeve.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  An arm leading to a fucking torso, leading to a fucking wispy, simpy, fucking girl voice  brain.  Makes me sick.  Girl voice brain. 
[01:58:30]  I hate him.  People are just, they're, they're thrilled that they could put a chair in the middle of  Times Square.  I would like to hear meh, meh.  What would be better?  And just see her flattened.  Yeah.  Look, nothing.  He's a dump, a drunken foreign dump truck driver.  Like, he's so drunk, he's vomiting out the window as he plows into her back.  Oh, yay.  Some interesting little shitty language.  I was driving yesterday.  Trying to explain that he drove through here last time he came through. 
[01:59:00]  It's all fine.  I have to send money to my family.  Fucking A.  This is a real story?  Thank you.  God, is this one of the better stories in a long time?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is this great.  Headline, would-be jumper gets helping hand.  We hear these stories from time to time.  All of a sudden you just want to go home.  You're on a bridge and traffic is at a complete stop because some idiot's thinking about jumping,  right?  Asshole, self-centered. 
[01:59:30]  So this happened in China.  A bridge that has gained a reputation as a tourist destination after attracting at least 12 would-be suicide jumpers.  Since the start of April was the scene of a bizarre incident this week in which a passerby pushed a man who was threatening to joke.  That's great.  How great is that?  The passerby was agitated by the fact that the would-be jumper had held up traffic around the bridge for almost five hours.  Well, he deserves it.  None of the 12 who threatened to jump have done so, although each has held up traffic for several hours. 
[02:00:00]  A lot of people go on this bridge saying, hey, I'm going to jump.  And then no one jumps.  And everyone's like, what the fuck?  I waited for hours and you didn't even jump?  In the latest case, a man named...  Threatened to kill himself on Thursday after saying he was in $2,000,000 of debt following a failed construction project.  Yown?  Yown?  Yen?  No, yen is like yen.  That's yown.  That's got to be like eight bucks.  All right. 
[02:00:30]  After being pushed off the bridge, Chen fell eight meters onto a partially inflated emergency air cushion.  The 66-year-old person who pushed him...  Who wants to handle the next Chinese name?  I'll get his name.  I'd broken through a police car and it climbed up to where Chen sat.  God, give us one more name, please.  Nope.  Oh, well.  He greeted him with a handshake before pushing him off the bridge.  Chen damaged his spine and elbow in the fall.  Oh, no.  They actually did call the police station. 
[02:01:00]  It was in the other article and it was answered by Officer...  And he said...  We have a two-letter last name.  I'm...  I know.  No vowels.  That N-G last name.  What's your name?  I looked up the conversion to see how much that guy was in debt.  It comes out to two million won or whatever it's pronounced is two hundred ninety-three...  Two hundred ninety-three grand?  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  One Chinese won is fourteen cents a bit.  And how far is fucking...  And it's one.  But you said it's one.  No, a one is four.  How far is eight...  Enough with meters.  Meters stink.  How far is eight meters?  Meters is .62.  Meters is the equivalent to, like, what a yard would probably be close to.  0.62 of something.  That's what I...  Eight meters.  A meter...  One meter is 3.28 feet.  So eight meters, the guy fell, it's 24 feet? 
[02:02:00]  The fuck is that?  What kind of bridge is that?  What is it, over a fucking creek?  It's over Devil's Creek.  There's Asians blowing each other underneath it.  He fell on a young boy.  Yes.  His dick went right in his mouth.  His fall is cushioned by the fucking...  By the baseball cap of a frightened lad.  Devil's clique, they call it.  Feels good to do Asian jokes again, doesn't it?  Occasionally.  Yep.  Devil's clique. 
[02:02:30]  Helio won the Indy 500 for the third year in a row.  And here is the audio of him crying.  Thanks to one of the listeners for pointing this out.  Helio, can you put into words what you're feeling right now?  This is a...  This is an incredible...  His mom is here in victory lane.  Okay, fuck it!  What's next?  Oh my God. 
[02:03:00]  What a crybaby.  Exactly.  Who, is that me?  For someone that goes vroom, vroom real fast.  Yeah.  He likes to cry.  And then?  They gave my life back.  And I'm here today because of those guys.  And obviously, fans, you guys...  You guys don't understand him.  Stop whining.  You guys...  You guys kept me strong.  You guys are the best.  Thank you so much.  I'm honored to have a fan like you.  Thank you so much.  Stop whining.  Let's celebrate now. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, baby!  Woo!  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  That's horrific.  Stop it.  That's horrific.  Stop it.  Wow.  God, what a baby.  No.  It's kind of a wimpy cry, too.  Fucking awful.  I'm just going to cry.  You got to try to keep it somewhat manly.  That's right.  Motherfucker.  Got gravy on his collar.  That's right.  When I first got into baseball...  Can we get Mike Schmidt?  One of my favorite...  Mike Schmidt's got the best...  The best retirement crying ever. 
[02:04:00]  He's trying to hold it together.  When I first...  And then he just loses it.  You don't think they know out there?  We're just playing it for our own happiness today.  Of course.  It makes us very happy.  Here it is.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio...  ...with two very bad knees...  ...and a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I thank God the dream came true. 
[02:04:30]  Stop whining.  The dream came true.  Yoo-hoo.  Toodle-oo.  The dream came true.  Fucking whining ass.  Exactly.  Congratulations, Mary Poppins...  ...on your induction.  Here's a tampon, Mike.  Fucking...  Fucking yourself.  My God.  Exactly.  It's a stupid game.  All his tears are collecting in that shitty mustache. 
[02:05:00]  His snots and tears are collecting in that fucking...  ...that horrible fucking stretching hair under his nose.  Oh, shit.  What's the big deal anyway?  We all played baseball.  Yeah.  It's kind of easy.  Big deal.  You hit a fucking...  ...a ball and you ran in a circle.  Congratulations.  You contributed nothing.  And then you get a snow cone when the game's over.  You left Dayton and did nothing.  Too bad knees.  Exactly.  It's great.  Who cares?  Fucking...  ...eat some of a pogo stick and fucking hop into the river, sissy boy. 
[02:05:30]  Was he good?  I don't even know anymore.  Oh, Schmidt was great.  That's what time does.  Dayton, Ohio.  How good was he?  He was great.  I know.  In a dream to come in like baseball.  Sorry.  In a dream came true.  I thought you were really asking.  Literal Jim.  I didn't mean to be literal.  Yeah.  He got $3 million for the race.  That's why he was crying.  PIX is asking a question that we couldn't have asked on terrestrial radio.  Ever peed in the shower? 
[02:06:00]  75% of poll takers have.  Wow.  That number's way higher.  We couldn't do that.  We could not have said that on fucking regular radio?  No.  I would say that number is well over 90, 95% of all people stayed in the shower.  Of course.  They're talking with the doctor of the show.  He's actually the doctor.  Oh.  Is he?  So I wonder if he's saying if this is good or bad.  What could he say?  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  Everybody.  You know, if you get in the shower and you're like, I got to take a piss. 
[02:06:30]  You're not going to get out of the shower and go to the toilet.  You're going to fucking take a piss.  I actually walk from the living room and just stand at the tub and piss into it.  I ignore the toilet.  The toilet does not exist.  Exactly.  I use the toilet to cool beverages.  When do we get back?  That's a guy.  What?  Mr. Fusion saying, I poop in the shower.  Of course.  While someone's bathing.  And then you have to stomp it to get it into the drain. 
[02:07:00]  So it goes through the drain like Silly Putty through those molds.  It makes spaghetti.  Well, since we're sharing childhood stories, I do recall one time as a young child and being  in the shower with my dad as it happens sometimes.  And I told him that I had to get out of the shower.  I must have been like three or four.  I was a tiny little child.  And he said, why?  And I said, because I have to go to the bathroom.  So he just assumed that I'm at number one.  He's like, we'll just go since we're on this peeing in the shower situation. 
[02:07:30]  So I was like, yeah.  And he's like, yeah.  And then I shit in the tub.  What did he say?  And I said, hey, no.  Exactly.  Then I got yelled at because he told me to.  And I just remember being just the smallest child going, but you said.  Yeah, you said.  But you said.  That wasn't your father, Danny.  He always mixed us up.  I used to babysit when the Rosses would go out and play Pinochle.  They'd call me and say, oh, boy, he's a little wild.  You had a plump little hiney.  I know you do. 
[02:08:00]  He's a good boy.  When do we get back?  I'd give him sips of my pabs.  Loosen him up a little.  Oh, sure.  Cry and fall asleep.  He'd poop in the tub.  Opie, you should have heard me cry when Jimmy told me he wasn't swimming at my house anymore.  Oh, shit. 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  Oh, shit.  The earlier.  It took me a second, too.  Oh, yeah.  A little while.  Olympic divers jumped from 30 feet.  So that fall that Chinaman did was no big deal.  Oh, but not pushed.  And he landed soft.  Off the diving board.  He landed soft, too.  Did he?  And a few people getting the Brian Regan reference.  Very good.  Hey, when we get back, we're going to talk about Erock's pizza problem.  That's all we know so far.  It might make you forget about Devil's Creek. 
[02:09:00]  I don't think so.  Why?  Just because.  What, do you have little hairless cocks on his pizza?  Good old Erock and his pizza problem.  He had to complain.  I ordered unclipped cocks, and they gave me clipped hairless little penises on my pizza.  Erock's pizza problem is going to be a hoot.  But first, the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  You have five new voice messages.  First voice message. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, this is a big old fuck you to the bitch I used to work with a few months ago.  Bitch, you made my wife nizzle every single moment of the day.  Fuck you and your false teeth and your fat ass and your floppy boobs.  Next message.  Yeah, this goes out to all you assholes in the morning that have to start work as you leave the house.  Put your fucking paperwork down.  Put your makeup down.  Stop texting your friends. 
[02:10:00]  And fucking drive.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Dennis from Ohio.  I want to leave a big F.U. to Mother Nature.  Fuck you, Mother Nature.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a F.U. for that bitch ass motherfucker that called up saying F.U. to the dude that was pissed off.  That couldn't get his F.U. on the phone.  Fuck you, you fucking fat fuck.  Next message.  This F.U. goes out to my ex-wife.  You think he can leave me for some other guy? 
[02:10:30]  Because he's got more money and his business works good?  Well, hey, if I were bankrupt, do you think you can call me back and take me back and come back and call me and want to get back with me?  You've got a better chance of getting laid by little Jimmy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:11:00]  6, FU, line one.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They got another album out, right?  Doing well, too, huh? 
[02:11:30]  It's like Green Day.  Yep.  What's the top five songs in America right now?  Lady Gaga.  Couldn't even tell ya.  Man, you just move around the channels, all you hear is Lady Gaga.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Holy shit.  Is that who's got the number one song?  Denny Miller.  Instant feedback of the day.  Sorry to Steven S. from Bayshore, and sorry to Blue Heeler in Kentucky,  and sorry to just about every single other person out there right now, 
[02:12:00]  but this is the feedback of the day.  Schmidt left Ohio with Two Bad Knees,  and Jimmy left Devil's Creek with Two Bad Knees.  That's not true.  Kind of good.  And then Dan from Rochester.  This just made us laugh, I don't know, for five straight minutes,  and I don't even know why.  He writes,  Let's dress like cars and walk honking horns through Times Square.  That would be really funny.  Yeah, just like cabs.  What do we got? 
[02:12:30]  These are the top five songs in America?  Why can't I read?  I got to fucking get glasses.  I can't see, goddammit.  I got that LASIK.  Me too.  And now it's, I'm ten years in, I think.  I can't see anymore.  What, it wear off?  I think so.  You get older.  They said when you get older, though, you're going to need reading glasses no matter what.  Mine's slightly off on my left side.  It's really good, but my right, I think, is 20-20.  My left is probably close, but I'm 40.  It's like, I should have got it when I was 25.  My distance sight is really good. 
[02:13:00]  My close-up sight is getting worse by the goddamn day.  You know what I did that was a mistake?  Terrible.  This new BlackBerry, the Curve, they told me, avoid the storm, avoid the bold.  They just don't have those two figured out yet.  They just go with the brand new Curve, which is, what, a month and a half old?  Problem is, like, the websites pop up on this thing.  The writing is so ridiculously tiny that I think I'm fucking up my eyes.  It's really bad.  You can, yeah, to a point.  I think a lot of people are straining their eyes looking at their various iPhones. 
[02:13:30]  I think so.  I noticed just a drastic change in the last, I don't know, half a year.  Yeah.  I noticed with the iPhone, if I go to a website, I can make the website bigger, so I could get bigger letters,  but then you're, like, scrolling back and forth with it.  So I'd rather make it just big enough where I could see the whole thing.  Right, and then you're straining.  Why can't I strain to read it that way instead of making it bigger?  The number eight and the number three.  Oh, boy. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, what is that?  The number eight.  What were the top five songs, Dan?  Anything on that list?  Well, you got Black Eyed Peas with Boom Boom Pow.  Boom Boom Pow.  That will be the song of the summer.  I don't know that song.  Every summer, you need a summer song, and that's going to be the one this year.  You could text, you could download Boom Boom Now by texting number four, three.  Boom Boom Pow.  Boom Boom Pow. 
[02:14:30]  This will be the song of the summer.  Sorry to leave.  Is this their beat?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Fergie jumps in in a minute and acts very, very black, which is nice for everybody.  Extremely black, yeah.  Oh, that's so awful.  Oh, fucking you.  That's freaky. 
[02:15:00]  I just said fucking you.  I'm sold three thousand at eight.  You sold two thousand at late.  I got that boom, boom, boom.  That future boom, boom, boom.  Let me get in that boom, boom, boom.  Gotta get that boom, boom, boom.  Gotta get that boom, boom, boom.  Oh, my God.  Horrendous.  Number one song in America.  Then you got Lady Gaga, Poker Face.  I was going to move.  Poker Face?  Yeah, well, that's what she's getting at.  She's being cute with her little Poker Face song.  But number three, Jamie Foxx has the third hottest song in America right now? 
[02:15:30]  And that song is gigantic.  What is it?  It's gigantic.  This song stinks, too.  You've heard it, too.  The minute you hear it, you'll be like, oh, I've heard this a thousand times.  No way.  Uh-huh.  No way.  You got a...  What is it called?  Blame It?  Yeah, it's called Blame It.  All right, let me hear it.  Is that Lady Gaga we just heard?  Yeah, yeah.  She's fucking horrendous.  Really?  She's like...  Horrible.  She is like on every fucking radio station in America.  She's fucking...  I think rock stations are starting to play.  She's god-awful. 
[02:16:00]  This is the song's everywhere.  I am so sick of that fucking effect.  All right.  Everything is auto-tuned.  Everything's got that on it.  Enough already.  If you want to hit song, you have to do that with your voice.  You've got to do the auto-tuning.  Stop it.  Stop it.  This is atrocious.  He used to be a comedian, right?  Yeah, I used that term loosely, too.  I never found him funny, entertaining. 
[02:16:30]  You never found Jamie Foxx entertaining?  No.  Let me think this over.  As a comic.  No.  Let me think.  Let me think.  I thought he was very funny on In Living Color.  I don't know his stand-up.  No, he wasn't even a funny guy on In Living Color.  What characters was he on?  Well, Wanda was his most famous.  Oh, I hated that one.  Yeah.  Are we going to get in trouble for trashing a serious product?  What other characters did he play?  I don't know.  I hated Wanda.  I was not in.  That was it.  Was that really it?  Wasn't he one of the gay movie critics, too?  Yeah, I think he was.  Oh, I hated that one, too. 
[02:17:00]  Damon Wayans and him?  It was Damon Wayans and I don't think it was him.  It wasn't him.  Was it David Allen Greer?  It was David Allen Greer.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  So what other characters on In Living Color?  And then what did he do after that?  Why is Jamie Foxx considered funny?  Exactly.  No, I mean, I'm asking that question.  I don't know.  Someone could maybe answer the question.  I don't know.  Was he in any really funny movies?  I really don't know.  No.  No?  Oh, here comes Sam.  He's done stand-up specials.  I've never seen them.  He had his own show. 
[02:17:30]  The Jamie Foxx show.  Yeah, see?  See, we didn't even know that.  It was on the WB.  Of course it was.  Why is Jamie Foxx funny?  That's the question today.  His sitcom was huge.  What was it called?  No, it wasn't.  The Jamie Foxx show.  It was on the WB.  It wasn't huge.  It was very big with certain audiences.  On the WB.  It was big with audiences.  Oh, with certain audiences.  Moesha was a pretty big show, too.  It was giant.  Yeah, with certain audiences.  You're looking at his IMDb.  What in there?  Jarhead.  That answers the question. 
[02:18:00]  Dreamgirls.  Collateral.  It was a sitcom.  I'm telling you, that's what made people think he was funny.  It was a sitcom.  Huh.  He's not fucking funny.  And then he's got one of the hottest songs in America, but it's barely his voice.  We can make anyone sound this good.  This is a broken CD.  There's a bit.  I found that.  They're using the effect to the point where it sounds like,  a skipping CD.  If you guys Google or YouTube, auto-tune the news, there's somebody, they do a bit where 
[02:18:30]  it's just somebody doing the news, but with this effect.  Oh, really?  Where is it?  Is it worth playing on the show?  Maybe now that it's been brought to everybody's ears.  Yeah, let's take a look at that.  What are the other two songs?  We have these three.  What are they going to affect?  Let's see if they affect you on the other songs.  And people are saying the Boom Boom Pow came out too late.  It's not going to be the summer song?  No.  It's been on the charts for over two months already.  Oh, fuck it.  No, Boom Boom Pow will be around for a little while.  What's going to be the song in the summer?  Well, Lady Gaga's got a new one.  Oh, right with her?  Poker Face is not the song anymore. 
[02:19:00]  Fucking awful.  She's got a third song already?  Love Game.  What's Love Game?  It's good.  It's not good.  It's good.  It's a good album.  I like just yelling at you guys.  No.  It's not.  This stuff gets you angry.  Oh, I know.  Now she's talking about the disco stick.  Is she sitting on the disco stick or something?  She said, I want to take a ride on your disco stick.  Yeah.  All right.  She's all about the double entendre with Lady Gaga.  So she wants to fuck.  She does.  She's had it with cocks in her mouth. 
[02:19:30]  Now she wants to take one in her fart box.  By the way, I was listening to Sam on Woo Kid's show on.  Yeah.  What was it?  Shade.  Shade 45.  Shade 45.  He was on.  Were those black porn stars hot?  Yeah.  One of them was really hot.  Really?  And the other one had to be a mess, right?  She was right.  I mean, she's a porn star.  She's been in the business for a while.  That doesn't mean anything.  Woo Kid had Sam on and these two porn stars that were just talking about sucking cock.  And they were pretty much insane. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  They were out of there.  They were both crazy.  Yeah?  Yes.  Could have gotten any, you think?  Maybe.  They were trying to get Sam in the action.  Oh.  I said no.  They would have destroyed you.  I know.  I said no.  Yeah.  They would destroy any of us.  You definitely wouldn't have held up.  I could have held up.  Fragile young man.  No.  My girlfriend was listening, though.  But if she wasn't, right?  Well.  I'm with you.  You can get serious up in Niagara Falls, Ontario? 
[02:20:30]  That's Fez.  Oh.  Booty Call was a real funny movie.  Oh, yeah.  Jamie Feist was in that movie.  Stop it.  I can't even give my opinion on that.  I don't, I don't, I didn't see Booty Call.  It was not a funny movie.  Well, let me ask Matt why Booty Call was a funny movie.  Let's learn a little bit about Jamie Foxx today.  One of the hottest songs in America.  Yes, Matt.  What made Booty Call a funny movie?  Jamie Foxx made it a funny movie.  I don't know. 
[02:21:00]  They have to try to get laid and they have to go and like, they can't, he can't hook up  with this one girl until his friend hooks up with the other girl.  Oh, damn, yo.  Oh, that does sound funny.  It's not in your genre.  I understand that.  But it was a funny movie.  You got to give it a shot, Anthony.  Have a Booty Call at the theater.  You know, we interviewed Jamie Foxx a long time ago.  He couldn't have been nicer.  But I really am trying to think why people consider him funny.  Yeah, when we flew down for the sort of Grammys thing. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  And we were in the Roseland Ballroom.  He was in between gigs.  He was in between gigs.  He was really trying to figure out what was next.  Yeah.  For himself.  And he couldn't have been nicer.  And when he talks about Miley Cyrus, that's funny, too.  Yeah, but that was all right.  I hear his show does pretty well.  Thank you, Matt.  Let's go to Bob the Girl in Maine.  Bob the Girl.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  You're not a girl.  Oh, who said it was a girl?  It says on the screen, Bob Girl. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, well, I don't think your screen doesn't know what they're talking about.  Probably heard a girl in the background.  All right.  Go ahead.  No, that song, Boom Boom Pow, they mention the word satellite radio, and they actually  beep it out when they play it on Sirius XM.  No.  What do they beep out?  They don't.  I've heard it.  I've heard both versions.  Why are they beeping out satellite radio?  The clean version of the song that's on terrestrial radio has the word satellite out, so it goes  here we go, here we go, radio, when the real version of the song goes here we go, here 
[02:22:30]  we go, satellite radio, but I've heard the real version.  Those fucking cocksuckers, they'll take fucking satellite radio ads, but they won't play.  I don't get it.  What a bunch of fucking cunts they are on regular radio.  I know we are.  They won't take, they'll take satellite revenue ads, but they will not leave a song  with the word, now they're beeping out competitive words?  What a bunch of fucking pussies.  Keep beeping, keep cutting until there's nothing left. 
[02:23:00]  How about you put out a better product?  How about you stop fucking selling the same three commercials for an hour, you fucks, and  letting lawyers dictate your content policies.  Dictate.  Not that the lawyers here are any better, but at least they don't dictate everything  that comes out of our mouths.  Let's say hi to Daryl in Arkansas.  Daryl.  Hey guys, what's going on?  Hey, Daryl.  Hey, in the back of this month's Playboy where they have like the little celebrity pics where  they're exposed, Lady Gaga is in there, and her breast looks like a deflated balloon. 
[02:23:30]  She's got the worst case of pancake titties I've ever seen.  Oh, really?  Lady Gaga has pancake titties?  Yeah, it's bad.  I mean, it looks like droopy's ear.  I mean, it's horrible.  Can we find the picture of Lady Gaga's pancake titties, please?  Really?  It's very funny.  I can't.  You want to hear the terrestrial version of Boom Boom Pow, that line anyway?  Just to reference what we're talking about here?  Hit it there, E-Roc. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, did Louis C.K. write Booty Call?  I don't know.  He directed it.  I don't know if he wrote it.  I don't know.  Louis C.K. directed Booty Call?  No, he directed Pooty Tang.  Pooty Tang.  Jeez, right.  It's a big difference.  The fact that terrestrial radio would beat that out, it's just like, what a fucking disgraceful  group.  What a disgraceful fucking group of people they are. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, would you, Fergie?  Fergie?  Let me see.  Where's the Fergie picture?  Hang on.  I'm on the fence with a little Fergie there.  She looks a little...  Looks a little what?  Oh, yeah.  That looks like...  Yeah, I would.  That's a good fucking picture of Fergie.  That's not a recent picture of Fergie.  No.  Fergie started to look a little too dirty lately.  A little skanky?  A little too dirty.  Nothing wrong with a little dirty.  Let me see Fergie.  Is that her with a sweaty vagina?  That's when she peed her pants.  Can you see what she looks like? 
[02:25:00]  I wouldn't know.  She peed her pants.  Yeah.  Why?  You can't just go to the bathroom when you're on stage doing a show.  She said, fuck it.  That's fucking hot, right?  I don't know why that's hot.  Is it hot?  Yes, very.  Look at Fergie there, though.  Would you do that one?  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Yeah, I gotta give Fergie a yeah.  Yeah.  I'd probably throw Fergie.  Because she's, you know, Fergie.  Would you lick her asshole?  I don't know.  You really gotta see one before you lick it. 
[02:25:30]  There's a lot of shit going on there.  And I don't literally mean shit.  I mean, you know.  I hear you.  A lot of stuff.  Let's go to this guy with the annoying phone.  Avery, Tennessee.  How are you?  Oh, I got an iPhone.  That's all right.  Hey, let's auto-tune Kenny for the bit of the Summer Song Summer thing.  Can we auto-tune Kenny?  Would that be an easy thing to do?  Yeah, we have it here.  What song do we have him auto-tune, though?  We could do the Jamie Foxx song.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  You want to try to, like, make Kenny a pop sensation?  Yeah.  With some auto-tuning?  Auto-tune that motherfucker.  All right, we're going to auto-tune the fuck out of Kenny.  Fergie looked horrible on that picture.  Good idea, Avery.  Hey.  Is that auto-tune the news?  Oh, okay.  Someone's saying number three's the best.  You want to play it?  Yeah, I mean, if you want, we could auto-tune the news, number three.  Run it until it sucks.  On YouTube, if you want to check it out for yourself.  News.  There is a lot of news, and it's happening.  Justice Souter is retiring.  There's a swine flu pandemic.  People are turning into pigs. 
[02:26:30]  Michelle Obama.  She's wearing a cardigan.  You know, Jonah Plummer's making headlines for telling them.  He says they are called queer.  Jonah Plummer.  I think he's really shiny.  I know you're pet.  You guys, this is not making any sense at all.  Can you please just sing about it?  They know where I stand.  I think this is an ignoramus statement.  I was even a person who thought, you know what?  Power to Jonah Plummer at that point.  Before we ran around, laid his pipe all over down.  Jonah Plummer is not invited anywhere around me.  Because baby needed to shoot.  Tissue.  Thinking about the time the plumber kissed you. 
[02:27:00]  Tissue.  Before you go to keep him with the shit suit.  Shit suit.  As Republicans, the party does seem to be in chaos.  They need to change their attitude, attitude, their attitude, attitude.  Tell us what your homies can do to make a change.  When they talk about personal freedoms, they have to believe, you know.  To believe, you know.  To believe, you know.  We know, we know, we know, we know.  You just have to believe, you know.  To believe, you know. 
[02:27:30]  To believe, you know.  We know, we know, we know, we know, we know.  You're saying with Republicans on crack, are you closing with a Democrat?  I just think that the party right now offers a whole lot.  You see some real change from the third party in my house.  Popping champagne, car getting clunked out.  Drip around and win your body while we're vibing here to sleep.  Come on over, drink something, only.  We'll be friends with you.  And PFF with you.  Main enemies with you.  And colleagues with you.  I'll be in your crew.  I'll be in your stew. 
[02:28:00]  Jumping rope with you.  Laying doggy phone with you.  Ashing plans with you.  Invite a Jigestan with you.  We do not believe either Afghanistan or Pakistan can achieve lasting progress.  Without the full participation of all of your citizens, including women and girls.  Having a barbecue.  Rilling a goat with you.  When I'm Paris too.  Getting matching tattoos.  The rights of women must be respected and protected.  Taking flowers with you.  Malti showers with you.  Rolling in love with you.  New death of zoo.  Making memories at the boundary field. 
[02:28:30]  Rub and play on you all afternoon.  Oh.  It would be one of the most dramatic foreign policy about peace is ever.  To have a European charade.  A bipartisan bill in Congress within the 37 mil trade freeze with Cuba.  Oh, hello, congrats.  It has only spotty support so far.  But President Obama's already taken something to say.  That's pretty brilliant.  I mean, I was hating it at first, but then I kind of got me.  You know what?  You got to watch the video alongside it.  It's amazing.  It really is.  It just shows you that they're fucking music up with this auto-tuning. 
[02:29:00]  They're actually...  The one with the Clinton was amazing.  Hillary and the guy from Pakistan and...  News clips.  Pakistan, India?  And they make them sing to it, but they're just talking.  Yeah, they're just auto-tuning there.  That's why you don't have to sing anymore to have a hit record.  Wow.  Just talk the words out in monotone fashion and let the auto-tuner do the work.  That's why Kanye is like the king of auto-tuning.  Did someone post some raw audio of Kanye and it was just...  Well, he did on Saturday Night Live without auto-tuning. 
[02:29:30]  He didn't sound as well.  Because he did his whole last album auto-tune.  I don't think that's going to happen.  This is an awkward silence.  I guess I feel the dick change.  Oh, oh, oh.  Shut up.  Jesus.  It's worth taking a peek later today.  It's auto-tune the news number three on YouTube.  All right.  It's taking off, man.  We didn't get to finish the list of top songs. 
[02:30:00]  His screening technique isn't very good, though, Danny.  I noticed he should light the green screen a little better.  Getting a lot of...  I want to have contact.  A lot of bleeding.  Help him out a little bit.  You know.  Hey, what were the other songs, then?  Oh, no.  Jimmy, you wanted the other two, right?  There was two more I didn't hear.  The other three were such hits and such great songs.  Fabulous.  Fucking god-awful.  Pop music, man.  Brutal.  Pop music. 
[02:30:30]  Well, we can't all listen to Black Sabbath, Jimmy.  Why?  We certainly can.  By the way, I was watching on HD Channel last night.  They were showing some old Zeppelin footage.  There was some concert.  And fucking...  I mean, they're really a great band.  But fucking plant, man.  Enough with the sexuality.  His little open shirt.  He was wearing a vest.  It was a nipple-high vest with his cock bulging.  But that was just a replay.  He's moved on past the sexuality.  I'm just talking about it with Alson Crouch.  I'm talking about the 70s, though.  Or whatever her name is. 
[02:31:00]  His fucking sexy ass up there singing stolen shit.  Enough with the fucking Zeppelin Sabbath comparison.  Holy shit.  About singing about juice running down his leg.  Exactly.  We get it.  You're hot.  You're big head.  You're fucking awful Bette Midler perm.  We get it.  In this song, we know.  Oh, we know.  It's the same song.  The song remains the same.  Right.  Same as who?  The band that wrote it and you took it from?  Fuck one.  I'm alone on this one. 
[02:31:30]  God, did they annoy me last night.  I don't hate Zeppelin.  I'm sick of the overrating of Zeppelin.  I am sick of Zeppelin.  Inside, woman, you need...  That's a new one.  And he hands it off to the audience.  He dressed like a fucking girl.  He's standing there with his tights.  That was the thing in the 70s.  With a little short, sexy vest. 
[02:32:00]  They actually wore like girl jeans and shit.  Exactly.  His little tight vest showing off his midriff.  And he'd hold the mic like this.  Yeah.  Dainty motherfucker.  Look to the side and shake his hips.  With his big balls.  Exactly.  I'm sorry.  God damn it.  I do have the fucking song of the summer, Stephen S.  You're right.  You're right.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  That's my favorite.  You guys all know.  Exactly.  You guys all know this summer song.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  I don't know this summer song.  Yes, you do.  I want to know any summer song.  There he is.  Look how sexy Robert Plant is.  That stupid, sultry face.  Like a woman.  Yeah.  He looks like Rocky Dent as if you were a woman.  Can I present you the summer song for the year?  How do you say the aught part?  20 aught nine.  20 aught nine.  Here it is.  Your summer song.  Two double aught nine.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken. 
[02:33:00]  Let me fry chicken in London.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  You have me.  You have me.  Does that picture bother you, Jimmy?  Fry.  It doesn't even bother me.  I just get so sick of the comparison.  Kind of bothers me, to be honest with you.  And the fact that that's what the critics love.  Of course they did.  He's wearing girl jeans, a girl shirt.  Hip shirt.  Yeah.  Wide open.  Hip huggers.  Sexy look on his face.  We saw Robert Plant.  His head is ridiculously big. 
[02:33:30]  And then you have to throw all that hair on.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  How big was the...  Fucking enough with them already.  The hair head combo.  It was all slow and boom, boom, boom.  Half of it was boring.  I'm sorry.  I watched it.  Of course it was.  Half of it was boring.  Which one did you watch?  I don't remember.  I turned it off.  Song Remains?  Don't remember.  I'm guessing.  Were they showing the clip of the fat guy yelling at the vendor for selling unauthorized  posters?  Really?  I'm guessing it was Apple's manager. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  I never made it through the whole thing.  It's so awful.  Fucking boring.  Did Jimmy Page bring out his bow?  No.  He was playing.  He was very good.  And they didn't really show much of John Bonham.  Why would they?  They were too busy showing this chick.  Too busy showing her.  Why would you go to Bonham with his mustache and his fucking alcohol problem?  I would much rather have watched him.  Or Page.  Yeah.  I didn't need to see her being sultry.  Traipsing on the stage.  Got to give him at you.  Shaking the hips.  And we get it.  You're sexy.  You think that was his real cock?  Or was he packing some shit? 
[02:34:30]  He might have been.  He didn't move.  If you're dancing, won't it shift?  He's up there doing like an elf dance.  Little hips shaking.  His ass was wiggling too.  Fucking Moe.  He was dancing down there.  Kissing off a lot of Zeppelin fans today, my friend.  I'm not saying Zeppelin sucked.  They didn't suck.  I like Zeppelin.  Hammer of the Gods.  I got tired of the overrating of these.  Hammer of the Gods.  Like they were these metal gods.  Let's see.  Ozzy not exactly manly in concert with his fucking eyeliner. 
[02:35:00]  But I'm not saying that it's fucking.  There's a difference between fucking being theatrical and traipsing around.  Oh, God.  Trying to be sexy.  Is that planned?  Yeah.  Find me one Ozzy picture where he's wearing an open muumuu and his fucking hand to the right.  His hand is kind of like he's going to grab a champagne glass from someone.  But Jimmy, for the sake of fairness, Ozzy did go through his Bette Midler wig phase.  In the mid-80s.  Yes, he did.  But that was.  Holy shit.  Ozzy, yes, he did.  And it was awful.  He's wearing blaze barefoot.  When he's doing that fucking shot in the dark video, even he'd tell you he throws a burn. 
[02:35:30]  It's fucking horrible.  Down, down on the bottom line.  And people don't like that you're turning Robert Plant into Herman Munster, Anthony.  All right, look at that.  What?  That you're turning Robert Plant into Herman Munster.  Oh, sorry, that's the way it sounds.  Ho, ho, ho.  The song remains the same, Grandpa.  What's wrong with that Ozzy?  I don't have a problem with that Ozzy picture.  No, it's just like, it's, it's, it's.  What album is that?  I don't remember.  Is it The Rest of the Wicked?  We're looking at it.  Oh, No More Tears.  No More Tears.  He's looking to the right.  It's kind of an effeminate, like, gentle look, but that's a painting. 
[02:36:00]  First of all, it's like a photograph.  He looks like Richard, Richard Marks.  Yeah.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  I'm saying, find me 70s footage of Sabbath, where Ozzy stands up there like a fucking woman.  He's just clapping and jumping like a retard.  Fair enough.  That's true.  You know, motherfucking Carlisle, you're not helping matters.  Carlisle writes, want to see the most embarrassing Robert Plant song? 
[02:36:30]  Check out the video for the song called Sea of Love.  Don't show Jimmy that.  Why?  The honey drippers they were called?  Or honey, um.  Yeah.  It was after the Zeppelin thing, but he is a...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, exactly.  He's wearing his fucking full bodysuit.  What's in Ozzy's pants?  Yeah.  He's all bagged.  That was a toy.  Greatest city in the world.  Who's bigger bag?  I am chic or Ozzy Osbourne?  Goddamn.  Ozzy was just.  What Ozzy song were we listening to?  Ozzy was just... 
[02:37:00]  What Ozzy song were we listening to where it was like, there's no way Ozzy could ever hit  these notes?  A lot of them probably...  Symptom of the Universe he probably couldn't hit.  He won't do that anymore.  The ones that they do live...  What's that song?  May think it's strange  You can't kill rock and roll  Could never sing that song  That's fucking high  Yeah  Give me a little  This 
[02:37:30]  He's talking of another song  No I'm talking of an old song  This is 81  Wait stop again  Is this it?  Do it again Ian  For real  I don't think it's good  This might be the beginning  Let it play in for a second  Does it start rocking?  It doesn't go that fast  Untrue yes  Wow yeah I'm not sure 
[02:38:00]  It does kick in a little bit  It doesn't go that fast  I'm trying to see if anybody knows  Oh yeah you're right  This starts going  Yeah you got it  Yeah  After this it gets  It doesn't get really heavy  But it gets heavier  Yeah yeah it does  But it's really high  For Ozzy  Even this he would have trouble hitting 
[02:38:30]  I think  Yeah yeah  After this it gets a little  And then it kicks in  Right  Let's see  Then it gets going right  Yeah yeah  Here it comes  That's hard to hit  Yeah 
[02:39:00]  Cause rock and roll  Is why we live to the end  I love  I like this song  I love this song  Yeah that's a cool song  Let me say hi to Frank in Chicago  I'm not a big Ozzy fan or anything  But I do like that 
[02:39:30]  He's got some good stuff  Hey  Hey Frank  What's up guys  Hi Frank  What's up Frank  Hey Jimmy  What's going on  Does Robert and Ozzy comparison  Oh Frank was better huh  No I just  You know what this dude  Growing up  I got  I got tired of hearing  I like Robert Plant  He doesn't suck  But it was like  As a Sabbath then  It was always just  A natural comparison  People made  Right  And you got irritated  Of this perception  By the quote unquote  Rock community in the know  That Zeppelin were these gods  Above reproach 
[02:40:00]  And it's like  Then you find out later  That a lot of their rifts  Were taken  And I'm watching Plant  And it's like  He's just this  Look was he great  Sure  But he's effeminate  And they never should have been compared  They were different  They were different styles of music  Here's the thing  Now when you're looking at  A video from 1973  Which was in back  I mean back then  Those moves that he did  And everything  And I'm a huge Zeppelin fan  And I'm a huge Sabbath fan  Sure  But you can't really compare  Ozzy to Robert Plant 
[02:40:30]  In that respect  Well then they shouldn't have been doing that  They shouldn't have been making those comparisons  For all those years  That reality right there  It's just  But you're talking about  You're talking about him  Them ripping off songs  That was their first album  With all those blues  I mean where did all the blues come from  Everybody rips off somebody from somewhere  You're right  That first album  They'll even tell you  That first album  That they stole from Willie  You know  Willie Dixon  And all those old blues  But the difference is dude  Like we've gone over and played it  Like there's a lot of stuff  That's way too similar  And a lot of their bigger songs  Like Stairway to Heaven  And look of course Zeppelin was original 
[02:41:00]  But it was annoying  Like you watch Ozzy  Fuck it  The California Jam  Doing Children of the Grave  You know  That's like  That's a fucking man  At least performing  Watching Plant up there  With that fucking open shirt  Sabbath never sold sexuality  Ever  They never sold sexiness  They really couldn't  Of course they couldn't  Fucking awful  I hope he's terrible mustache  And they're fucking  You know  They couldn't have sold it  I don't think  They were looking for a geezer  As a sex symbol  What's that buddy?  At least we can say 
[02:41:30]  Robert Plant came out of his drug addiction  Better than Ozzy looked  I don't know when he came out though  Let's be honest  I'm sure Ozzy did more  Yeah I would think so  Yeah we're looking at Sabbath  They all look the same  Yeah we're looking at Sabbath  They're just fucking  Four grungy  Fucking dirt bags  This is a lot of pictures  I'm Zeppelin  Just like that  I just wanted to call Wayne  Because I'm a huge Robert Plant fan  I've never called him  And as soon as I heard that  I'm like  God Jimmy you're my guy  But don't piss my boy Robert  I have to though man  Hey Frank  When did you bail on Robert Plant though? 
[02:42:00]  Because most of us have  Well let me tell you something  About Robert Plant  And here's what pissed me off  Most about Robert Plant now  Is that he won't do this  Zeppelin reunion  And he  You know he's  Now more than ever  I'm pissed off at him  Thank God he can't  Because this house and Krauss  And this bullshit  And Jimmy Page  And John Paul Jones  And Jason  They're ready to go  He knows he can't sing  He can't sing those songs anymore  You know I love when my favorite bands  Get back together  But I don't  I'm a huge Zeppelin fan  Frank 
[02:42:30]  I don't know  In a way I want to just  Have it just rest where it is  Did anybody hear the O2  The London concert in December  That they did  The Zeppelin reunion?  It was good bro  You're right  I got it on DVD  It was good  Those guys were ready  I mean they sounded great  I mean give the fans  What you want  Nobody wants to hear you  Singing that bullshit  Lullaby  Elton Krauss shit  They want to hear Zeppelin  Give us one more  The wind was very short with this  Give us one more tour  That's it  Give us maybe  You know  20-30 dates  And then put it to rest 
[02:43:00]  Just do it  I think he knows  I think he knows  He'll never  Like he'll only  The only thing he'll be compared to  Is him  25-30 years ago  And he can't live up to that  It's almost like  There's nothing to be gained from it  He's already making money  Right  It's not a  It's not a motivation factor  Anymore than money  So  You guys are right  He can't think of YouTube  But we watch him  The thing like that  Breathing and yelling  Like in the 60s  I just want to see them play  God damn  Look at that  It's a very famous picture  Of Zeppelin  It's like  Their head shot 
[02:43:30]  It's terrible  It's hilarious  Looks like  Michael Imperioli  With a clown leg on  Robert Plant's hair  Is still not grown out  It's like  Just below  The earlobes  And really big  Yeah  And fucking  Jimmy Page  Looks like he just woke up  Dead head  Why does his head get so fucking big  What's going on  It's like a satellite dish  I gotta tell you Frank  Me and Jimmy  Were lucky enough  To meet Plant  Get a picture  And his head  Is enormous  It's giant  It's unbelievable  He's a giant head  He's a giant headed man  Yes  Like a pregnant chick  It's holding water 
[02:44:00]  Yeah  But you gotta see this photo  Fucking Plant doesn't have his hair grown out yet  And it's just a curly mess  Scott in  Florentine there  In Boston  Why  Why is the song the same  How can the song continue to remain the same  What's the problem  There's a bustle in my head's row  What's the matter with you  What's the matter with you  Scott in Boston  Scott  Hey guys  How's it going  Hi 
[02:44:30]  I just wanted to agree with you  You know  There's a time and a place  For reunions  And stuff like that  And I actually give Robert Plant  A lot of credit  For not doing a reunion  Because you got all these bands  Like  Even Van Halen  You know  How they wanted to get back together  Yeah  There's very few bands  That can continue to do it  After all these years  And Plant can't sing the songs anymore  So I kind of  You know  And I'm a big Zeppelin fan  I get  You know  Zeppelin tattoo  All that shit  But you know what I mean  You gotta know when 
[02:45:00]  When time is up  When your time is up  You know what I mean  Move on  It comes  It comes down to this  Robert Plant moved on  So long ago  He could give a crap about Zeppelin  At this point  But he does care about music  And trying to figure out  Where else he could go  With his  With his creativity  And his talent  Unfortunately  We're left behind  Going  Fuck all this  Weird shit you're doing  And give us  Give us a Zeppelin tour  You know what though  But you have to kind of  Look at it  From a different perspective  And you can't really  Compare the two  Because I mean  It's like 40 years ago 
[02:45:30]  You know what I mean  So you gotta  You remember that  It's Robert Plant  But you know  Like you said  It's a different chapter  So you really kind of  Can't compare  The one to the other  You know  Because he's not  He's not making a mockery  Of Zeppelin  Like Jimmy Page  Jimmy Page will run  Zeppelin into the ground  For as long as he can  Where Plant is  Like you know what  I did it  I'm Robert Plant  I'm doing something else  Take it or leave it  Well as an artist  Plant has moved on  And she really has no reason  To just redo the same stuff  Because she's only going to be 
[02:46:00]  Compared to what she did  Many many years ago  So I definitely understand that  You know Zeppelin's one of my  Zeppelin's one of my go-to bands  But I think  I don't know  I don't really  Need  I never saw Zeppelin  Matter of fact  I gotta pee  I never saw Zeppelin  I don't know if I would  I would go  I guess  I don't know why people  Want to see bands  Do things like that  When you wouldn't want to  Like see any other things  Like I don't want to see  A Charlie's Angels reunion  With the girls  The way they are  Why not  With the ass cancer  Come on  That  The breast cancer 
[02:46:30]  This cancer  I don't want to see it  It's Charlie's Cancers  They really did  Kind of get ravaged  What the hell was on that set  That they all were  Fucking sitting on  Where they filmed that  Nuclear reactor  Something was going on there  Bikini Island  Bikini Island  Three Mile Island  Love Canal  Another band that  Continues to go on  Is that Who  Yeah  And Pete Townsend  Doesn't want to do  That Who shit anymore  He never wanted to do it 
[02:47:00]  It seems like  But boy they keep  They keep getting back together  Enough money I guess  Roger Daltrey  Continues to talk him into it  He's got to pay for  His internet subscriptions  To certain sites  From Denmark or something  Yeah  And I can never tell  If Roger Daltrey  Can still sing  Because he'd crack anyway  Part of his voice was  That he would crack  When he sang  So is he still good  Was he ever good  A lot of harmonies 
[02:47:30]  In the Who stuff  Yeah  I'm trying to think  Was Roger  Daltrey a good singer  A good singer  Or could he really scream  And  Like scream well  I don't know  Yeah he could scream well  He could scream well  That's what I'm saying  But was he  Was he a good singer  Like I like  Behind Blue Eyes  So  Does he have a good voice  In that song  Is that him singing in it  I think so  Really  Yeah I think it is  Yeah yeah 
[02:48:00]  I was thinking of the other song  That Entwistle used to sing  Which one  Boris the Sponger  No that other one  My wife  He sang that  Yeah  Yeah  I don't know if he's a good voice  Or not  Love this song though  He's just talking about  The voice though  To me  Yeah he kind of  There's a lot of effect on this  He's having a tough time  To get up there  He's got good range 
[02:48:30]  In a scream  But how he just said vengeance  This is buried  Like his vocals are struggling  To get up that high  This is buried in echo  I just bury him in some harmony  Like I do  Like I don't know if he was  Ever a good singer  That's a really good question  And I was a big Who fan  Growing up too  Yeah  Did he have a good voice  I don't know 
[02:49:00]  Like he's  He's a little off  At some parts  But  But my dreams  They are  You hear that?  Yeah yeah  He's struggling to keep it up there  As my conscience  Seems to be  I have hours 
[02:49:30]  Only lonely  We could argue that one for a while  Yeah I know  Was Roger Daltrey  A good singer  All right  I don't know  All right  When we get back  Pete Townsend  Looks like an old vicar  Look at Pete  He just  He's a mess  Are we done finally Roger?  Yeah  Roger  Is this the last gig?  Oh does he look like  People's grandfather  Probably Roger found the kiddie porn  And said  Look Pete  You know what  You know what 
[02:50:00]  I got more files  You're going back on tour this summer  You motherfucker  Yeah  Because Roger Daltrey  Didn't write any of those songs  Right?  Wasn't it all Pete Townsend?  Pretty much Townsend  Yeah  Like Roger Daltrey  Looks fine there  Yeah  Look at Pete Townsend  It looks like a ventriloquist  With a down syndrome puppet  Jimmy's back  Nice  Yeah Pete did write most of the songs  Like my generation  I like to fuck people  Not from my generation  Because the kids  Wow 
[02:50:30]  Wow  No that's not what I meant  You want to come back in from the bathroom?  Hold on  Come back in  Yeah come back in  That never happened  Do a sitcom entrance too Jimmy  Please  That never happened  Jimmy's going to do a  It could be  A sitcom entrance  One of Jimmy's worst bombs ever  On the show  Was he going for some kind of  Stuttering joke?  Jimmy  Jimmy's back  I'm back  Hey  You looking at the who?  Yeah  I heard Pete Townsend  Wrote a lot of their stuff  Yeah  Like I don't like to fuck girls  From my generation 
[02:51:00]  See  I figured I'd bomb twice  We can't allow that moment to be  Do the bitch  Yeesh  That was one of my worst bombs ever  That could have been  I think so  We're going to take a break now  When we get back  E-Rock's pizza problem  Alright  God  When did we  We better do that  Alright  Have we played Bossapedia in a while?  Yeah we just played it actually 
[02:51:30]  Ah  Jimmy  No bullshit  They played it today already  A little while ago  Am I right or wrong?  No you did  I'm trying to save us  From humiliating ourselves  Oh  Too late for that last bomb  Well I mean I'll take the bomb  But the whole show  Doesn't have to fucking  Go down the toilet with me  Exactly  Someone say  What about Pink Floyd?  I like Pink Floyd a lot  They were brilliant guys  A lot of their stuff  I get bored with  Yeah  But I still think  That they were brilliant guys  And extremely original  I hate long 
[02:52:00]  Friggin  Yeah  Ponderous  Self-fucking  Congratulatory  Congratulatory songs  Oh look at this  We could do this  We can write a fucking  Nine minute song  And  Lyrically they were brilliant though  You know what  Yeah  It leads to a bit  I loved  We only played it once  Because no one knew them  But Steve Freed  Remember when Steve Freed  Left our show?  The engineer that was at CBS  For like  39 years  10 and a half months  And they decided  They gotta fire him 
[02:52:30]  Because if he gets to 40 years  They gotta pay him a bunch of money  They kicked him down the elevator shaft  As he was taking his nitroglycerin  Yeah  Lovely company  So they kicked him out  Fucking dirtbags  Kicked him out  Around Christmas  All he needed was a couple more months  To get like  Benefits for the rest of it  No  All he wanted was health insurance  Yeah that's all he wanted  I just need my health insurance  Remember he never took a sick day  And he had like  He had like six months  Of vacation built up  I have them all built up  Because I've never taken time  And he took 
[02:53:00]  Oh  Yeah  And they took his sick days away from him  The guy rode a bus  For how many years?  Like 30 straight years  He rode a bus  In and out  To work for that company  And they just showed him the door  How many executives over there  Took fucking his?  I'd love to know  None  How many of them took big pay cuts?  None  So Steve Freed  We try to do the right thing  And throw it together  Some kind of going away  You know  Thing for him  And what did he do with Floyd again?  I love this thing  I can't  Hey did Tim make the cut by the way? 
[02:53:30]  No  He got fired with us  Oh yeah  He  He won't see him no more  How's 92.3 now doing?  Good?  Did they kick an ass?  No  No  There's no buzz on the station  No  Iraq  I thought we had the  Pink Floyd  Steve Freed did  He never did Pink Floyd  What did he do?  Led Zeppelin  What Zeppelin thing did he do?  He did a montage  No  The last day Freed was in  What did he do?  He did something really good  He was doing Cruel Cruel World or something 
[02:54:00]  Like Goodbye  There was some goodbye in it  Goodbye or Cruel World  I have him doing from his last day  Mad World and Love Song  Mad World?  That's a Gary something  Gary Jules  Well the original is  Uh oh  It's Tears for Fears  Tears for Fears  Yeah  Oh they wrote the original  The other guy remade  I didn't realize that  Yes  Cool  Why don't you humiliate me  Was it Mad World that he did  That brought us all  Pretty much to tears  Because it was so pathetic  Yeah it could be 
[02:54:30]  It might have been  It might have been  Let's try  No  Whatever  Just play that  We'll be back with  E-Rock's Pizza Problem  Oh  And I find it kind of funny  I find it kind of sad  The dreams in which I'm dying  The best I've ever had  I find it hard to tell you  Cause I find it hard to take  When people run in circles  The very very  Bad world 
[02:55:00]  Bad world  We get it  We're great  Can we get back to the live show  Jesus  Enough about us  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  I  We got into a discussion  About Pee Wee Herman  And I  I asked Ann  This is for all my  30 Rock fans out there  I said  Did you ever see  Pee Wee Herman  On 30 Rock  As the  As the Duke  Of some  Bizarre 
[02:55:30]  Small  Yeah  European country  That is visiting America  And because of inbreeding  He's a fucking mess  And we try to find the episode  Online  It's really hard  Like most of the videos  Have been removed  So I'm assuming that  NBC had a lot of problems  When this episode  Originally aired  Because  They never brought  This character back  And it was so fucking funny  He's so out there  The face he makes  And his teeth  Are all fucked up  He's got a tiny little hand  And a tiny little leg 
[02:56:00]  Only  Not two tiny hands  Mind you  One tiny hand  Right  And one tiny leg  And he's in a wheelchair  And he's paralyzed  And he's just a mess  His big leg is useless  It's like Linguini  Do you have when they introduce him  That whole introduction  I don't know if it'll work on radio  But  The way he talks though too  Is pretty funny  They try to match  They're making fun of handicapped  Oh  That guy's so far beyond handicapped  That is hysterical  Prince Gerhard Messerschmitt  Ramstein Van Hoop  They first roll around our corner 
[02:56:30]  And you see his face  Thank you  Thank you  Oh dear friends  For coming to my birthday  Wow  Who's Snow White now  745  And I'm still awake  I can't  Gerhard is amazing 
[02:57:00]  Isn't he  I mean most people  In this situation  Would be angry  With their family  For the centuries  Of inbreeding  But not Gerhard  He's too busy  Trying to stave off infection  That's great  It's a great episode  But  Something happened  With that whole thing  Because they made believe  That never happened  Pee Wee was great  In that  It's brilliant  Fucking great in that  They wheel him around a corner  And you first lay eyes on him  And it's like  What kind of makeup  Did they put on him  His eyes  He's got like rat eyes  They're all red around the edges 
[02:57:30]  He's got a horrendous haircut  A tiny little head  His haircut's horrible  A tiny little head  A tiny little leg  Oh it's great  He has to move his  His regular sized leg  With his arms  Arms  With his tiny hand  And his regular hand  So he can cross his legs  I love it  Turn to the head  Horrible teeth  Is that the only scene he's in?  You gotta find another one  I don't remember  This is a couple years ago now 
[02:58:00]  A couple seasons ago  And then he's gotta  He's gotta show what time it is  By holding up his tiny hand  And then pointing at his watch  And then he looks at it again  There's so many peewee-isms  In those little moves  That he makes  God damn  Is that fucking funny  Yeah it's really  Oh  It's really a good one man  I think he has another  Pretty big scene  He wasn't in the episode a lot  But  It just gets me every time 
[02:58:30]  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you all dear friends  For coming to my birthday  Wow  Who's Snow White now?  7.45  And I'm still awake  Oh he died in this episode  Alright  That's why they didn't bring him back  Oh  They could've figured out a way though  Oh god  Gerhard is amazing  Thank you Brian 
[02:59:00]  Oh god  I do my birthday  Centuries of inbreeding  But not Gerhard  Find another scene if you can  Oh  He died in that episode?  Yeah I forgot  Oh that's tragic  Yeah I forgot to be honest  That's fucking great man  Holy shit  How do you do a one and done  With that character?  Oh god  You'd have to bring him back  You'd have to  One of the sickest characters  I've ever seen on this show  I told you  Season 1 episode 12  On Netflix  Instant  Thank you to Tom 
[02:59:30]  I don't even remember  If the rest of the episode  Was good  I just remember  Pee Wee just stole this  Show from everybody  That Netflix Instant  Is great  Especially for TV shows  Love it  And they're getting more movies now  You notice that too?  Which is good  But they're still not like  The regular  Netflix  The regular  I like the regular Netflix  We're gonna move on  To T-Roc's thing  Is that that Dyke-y girl?  What?  Who?  What? 
[03:00:00]  That girl  Is she a lesbian?  In real life?  Wait we might have another scene  Oh shit  No  Attempting to wink  Oh wait wait wait wait  Move back a little bit  Because he's  He's just  He's trying to wink  At the hot blonde  From 30 Rock  He's trying to pick her up  His highness is attempting  To wink  At you  Oh  Okay no  That girl is actually  The daughter  From

[03:02:00]  Oh  Dickie Roberts  Dickie Roberts  Was that it  There's a scene  In Dickie Roberts  That is probably  Amongst the most  Inappropriate  Hot scenes  I've ever seen  What was it  Well  There's this  Cheerleading competition  At the  Junior high  I believe it is  And uh  They're trying to get  New cheerleaders  So Dickie Roberts  Is helping the little girl  In the family  Uh  Work out her cheer act  And uh  The girl that goes on  Before her  Does this 
[03:02:30]  What can only be described  As a stripper  Rug act  In front of the judges  And she is  Well below age  It's not some  Older girl  That looked younger  This is a young girl  Doing this  And it is  Very inappropriate  And I could not  Stop watching it  Is it very funny too?  Uh  I don't think  It's funny  Um  Yeah  That's her  Insane 
[03:03:00]  What this chick  Is doing  It's not appropriate  This is  Pedo stuff  She couldn't be  More than  Twelve  Yeah  You think  She's over 18  They just found  Like an actress  That looks young  Nope  Not at all  I think she played  She played young Brittany 
[03:03:30]  In a video or something  Or a stage show  Yeah she's got  A Brittany  Uh  So she  Uh  They're all like  Harfied by the moves  Give her another  Six months  Eh  Yeah  Yeah  And then she starts  Crawling on her hands  And knees  On the floor  Toward the judges  Oh yeah  Look at that shit  Ah ha ha ha  What the fuck  It's so bad  I saw it though  I was captivated  And then the  What the girl  That has to go next  Is horrified  Cause she has to  Yeah she's gotta  Follow that 
[03:04:00]  E-Rock  And his pizza problem  We go backstage  With Sam Roberts  And now  Backstage  With ONA  Here is  Primetime  Sam Roberts  I'm  Primetime  Sam Roberts  And when we last  Left E-Rock  He was refusing  To come into the studio  To sing happy birthday  To Opie  While only wearing  His underpants  We found E-Rock  To get to the bottom  Of why he wouldn't  Let Opie's birthday  Wish come true  So Eric  Opie wanted you to sing 
[03:04:30]  A song for his birthday  Today  And you didn't show up  In the studio  What the hell happened  No there was  There were some complications  I couldn't make it  To the studio  What do you mean  You couldn't make it  There would have been  A catastrophe  Had I gone  And done that  There was a  There was a  Potty emergency  That was about  To take place  What do you mean  I was going to  Explode my bowels  Tight Mouth  D-Rock wasn't  Detailed enough  So we decided  To get into  His potty emergency 
[03:05:00]  A little deeper  Why would you  Do do in your pants  Because  I was having  Some complications  From yesterday's dinner  What'd you have  For dinner yesterday  Yesterday I had pizza  I have what is  What will probably  Be known as  A pizza problem  I guess the cheese  Doesn't really sit  Well with me  Because about  Half an hour or so  After there's  Some complications  What kind of  Complications  Please describe  Some sharp  Stabbing pains 
[03:05:30]  Some blockage  And then maybe  A few hours after  Then it all decides  To come out at once  A pizza problem  For E-Rock  Well that wasn't  Enough information  For us  So we decided  To find E-Rock's  Live-in fiancé  And ask her  About E-Rock's  Pizza problem  So what's this  I hear about  E-Rock's  Pizza problem  Um let's just say  That E-Rock  Is a little  Lactose intolerant  He says that  Eating pizza  Makes him constipated  And then makes him  Shit himself  Um well he has 
[03:06:00]  Had to throw out  His underwear  A couple times  Now a couple weeks  Ago his ass  Smelled  And it was  Documented on the show  Do you think  That might have  Been a pizza day  I think that was  An ice cream day  Ice cream huh  Ice cream is also  Another issue  For someone who  E-Rock's  So much  E-Rock sure  Has a lot of  Food problems  Hopefully  Old pizza problem  Will find something  To curb his  All consuming need  For fatty foods  One option  Is death  I'm primetime  Sam Roberts  And this has been  Backstage  With ONA  What the fuck 
[03:06:30]  If you have a pizza  Problem and an ice cream  Problem would you  Be eating those foods  First of all  Even if he  Fucking digested  Them perfectly  Why is he eating  Pizza and ice cream  Isn't he on his diet  Or something  No he gave up  On that  Oh he gave up  He'll be the first  To tell you too  Where's E-Rock  Bring E-Rock in  Yeah E-Rock's got  Like hold on  Before  Because this can  This can lead into  A whole thing  I just gotta say  For Steve down the hall  Check your email  We might have  Pictures of Devil's Creek 
[03:07:00]  So check your email  Please  Here comes E-Rock  And Sam  E-Rock's the man child  Look at him  He's like a little boy  E-Rock you're not  On the diet anymore  Right  Oh no  Why  Oh no no no no  That last one  Was a nightmare  Eat meat again  Not as much  As I used to know  A lot of  Back to chicken  But  How much pizza  Don't tell me  A slice  No no no  That particular night  Was three slices  And some garlic bread 
[03:07:30]  And  What was you  And  What was dessert  Oh for dessert  Was  The Turkey Hill  Low fat  Thin mint ice cream  What low fat  Thin mint ice cream  That's a  Mowing down  Three slices of pizza  That low fat shit  Is  Bull's  Crap  And also  As far as  Not eating meat  Apparently  Cold cuts  Don't count  Cause  Oh mister  Five dollar  Footlong  Is putting  Subway  Out of business  Oh shit  Worked for Jared 
[03:08:00]  He didn't eat  Like fucking  Yeah  I think he had  Like the six inch  Lettuce hero  Jared  He's making  Fucking like  Cannolis  And a fucking  Pizza and ice cream  So  Do you shit your pants  Because of pizza  No no  It wasn't  A shitting the pants  Problem  Which would have  Happened  Had I come  Into the studio  It sits there  And it blocks  For a long time  Like you  You can't sit down  You can't bend over  Kind of  And then  A few hours later 
[03:08:30]  It just all  Slides out  It shoots right out  But it comes out  Almost like  Almost like  Shot puts  You know  Just do  These circle things  What's with the  Throwing away  Of the underwear though  Yeah  I think she was  Taking some liberties  With that  I don't think she was  Cause she was  Anytime  We hang out  And I make fun of  E-Rock  In front of her  She gives me  A dirty look  So she wasn't  Making it up  She's definitely  Thrown out  E-Rock's underpants  From shit stains  Why don't you 
[03:09:00]  Just stop at  One slice  If you have a  Pizza problem  I don't know  Why don't you  Eat a steak  Instead of a million  Pieces of pizza  Because I have  A steak problem  That's why  I don't eat it  Are you  Eric Negaliki  Oh god  So you  What the hell  Is that smell  So you just  Can't help it  Cause it  Is that Jimmy  I can't help it  You can't help it  Oh god  That is so bad  You can't help it  Cause you like pizza  That much  Even though it's  Going to cause  These problems  I don't eat it  That often  But when I do

[03:10:30]  From his fucking intestines  Everybody's telling you  And your fiancee  Knows about the pizza problem  Oh yeah  Because it usually involves  Her not being able  To access the bathroom  For hours at a time  Does she get bummed out  When all of a sudden  The pizza delivery guy  Is ringing your bell  It's like uh oh  I know what this means  The reason  The reason the phrase  Pizza problem  Has been used so much  Is because  That's what he and his fiancee  Refer to it as 
[03:11:00]  Like that's how familiar  She is with it  The pizza problem  At breakfast  We were discussing it  And he turned to her  And said  It was the pizza problem  Yeah I wasn't hiding it  It wasn't like a secret  I was like yeah  It was the pizza problem  Alright  I think the way he said  It was the best  Because he kind of  Looked at her  And kind of put his head  Down and he started  Being a little more  Soft spoke  He was like  It's like when I have  My pizza problem  It wasn't that dramatic  That's what they call it  Around the Nagel household 
[03:11:30]  Pizza problem  It's the pizza problem  A little ashamed huh  Yeah  Nah  I'll still eat it  Of course you will  I love you right  You don't give a shit  It'll kill me  But I'll do it  Are you done with diets finally  Uh diets  Probably yeah  For a while  So what are you gonna do  You're just gonna get fat  Cause as you get older  It doesn't slow down  Oh I know  It gets worse  You'll just get fat  You'll be a big fat guy  I know  This is really becoming  He's squeezing his neck 
[03:12:00]  Right now  His pelican neck  Well  This is what  Goes through my head  So I'm looking in the mirror  And I see this  Pizza  Treats  Ice cream  Repeat  No it's um  You know if you're brushing  Your teeth or something  And I see that  All that runs through my mind  Is Jimmy's pelican jokes  Just saying  Like there's a fish  Coming out of my mouth  Or something like that  Going in  And I need to get rid of this  This is becoming a real problem  How do you get rid of this  You should have three slices of pizza  Without diets  Right  I don't know  Yeah  Yeah you gotta 
[03:12:30]  You gotta figure out something  It's not gonna latch itself  To pizza as you should  And then go down your throat  Where you will digest it  It's  Yeah  Mmm  Yeah  You know what helps sometimes  If you just stand in front of the mirror  For hours and make this noise  That can't possibly work  It does  You feel like some sort of a weird animal  Is there something called bacon salt?  Oh my god 
[03:13:00]  There's  I don't know about that  Don't tell me  There's a bacon mayonnaise  I know that  Have you eaten it?  No  But I've had enough people email me  And I went to the supermarket  And I saw it  Why'd you get it?  I don't know  Did you see it or did you eat it?  No I haven't tried it yet  Or did you see it then?  I'd be happy to try it here  I just have not tried it yet  Do you eat mayo?  By the spoonful  Like pudding  It is drastically dropped  Since you finding out my mayo secret here on the show  The big mayo secret  Look there it is  What is it? 
[03:13:30]  It's called Bacon A's  Real clever name  Jesus  It's the best of both worlds  Eating shotgun shells is probably healthier  Than fucking Bacon A's  Bacon A's  Who doesn't want to try it now though?  That sounds like a  Sounds delicious  I don't know  I think I'm with you on that  A little Bacon A's on some pizza would be great  Oh wow  Yeah  Look at that  Bacon A's  Bacon A's  That's horrible  You know the worst part of the pig is thrown in there too  Yeah  Doesn't have to look good  Mixed with mayo  We only make this from pigs with cancer 
[03:14:00]  We throw their tumors in here  Oh shit  And their ground up hooves  And the Bacon A's  In high school you know how they  On Fridays was pizza day  They'd give you the pizza squares  Yeah I used to dip that in mayonnaise  What?  Because it tasted like cardboard  So it gave it a little flavoring to it  Pizza was good no matter what  You didn't have to jazz up pizza usually  Oh E-Rock  I know  E-Rock was the kid that you'd sit at the table  And mix everything into a cup 
[03:14:30]  Like fries  And like everybody's drinks  Oh fries and mayonnaise are the best too  And E-Rock would drink it for 25 cents  Alright  There's the pizza problem  E-Rock's pizza problem  His new nickname is pizza problem  Eric Nagel  Of course  Why wouldn't it be?  Are those pictures  Yes  Of  Devil's Creek  Devil's Creek pictures  Does Jimmy recognize it?  Let me see  Is this Devil's Creek Jimmy?

Yeah  But he wasn't inside of it at all  Let me see  Open this bottom one there  Yeah  Open this bottom?  Oh no  That doesn't look too devilish

Yes  Oh my god  I'd get shot while fishing  And saying Hail Marys  Alone  In the back of the head  No man  But again  It's been so many years  I have to just walk through  You'll have to go back  I'm sure it's much different  Now than it was back then  Do you realize that  Bacon Salt has its own website?  Really?  Bacon Salt  I hope he scoops his fat hand in there 
[03:16:30]  And just sucks it out of his fingers  That's made by the same people  Made by the same people as Bacon A's  Bacon Salt  Brought to you by the people  Who make nitroglycerin  Enough about the bacon  You don't have to put bacon  In everything  What other products  Do they have bacon in?

[03:21:30]  Little bacon  They have little bacon bits  That you can put under  A girl's cliff hood  Oh what is that?  What is that?  Danny what is that?  He's showing me a picture  It's like on a booze bottle  Apparently someone put bacon  In like a vodka bottle  With vodka  And that's like  After a few days  Oh damn it  And I'm thinking about  What that mustache is like  And I'm actually gagging  A little bit  It probably smells bad  That's what it does to your stomach  Horrible 
[03:22:00]  It looks like just  Dead animal  Which it is  In the bottom of the vodka  Pulverized  Do you know what's actually  Very good?  Rotting meat  If you leave bacon  In a container of milk  And you let it get warm outside  That's a delicious  And rare treat  Is that good?  Yeah  It's called sour bacon milk  And you're supposed to  Only drink it before  A long flight  So you can fart shit  And puke  Do you understand  As you take you off  You go like  And you'd shart  And vomit on yourself 
[03:22:30]  Shart?  Yeah  The fucking back  Of your ankles  Would be brown  And you'd have vomit  On the front of your shirt  You'd be very unpleasant  You'd do that  When you were in the middle seat  Going non-stop  To like Australia  You'd drink fucking  Sour bacon milk treats  Treats?  Yeah  Holy shit  You're fucking killing it  Oh my god  Every fucking hole  Would have some  Foul liquid coming out of it  Of course it would  You'd be the worst  Travel companion  Lean over and talk to someone  With your fucking  Bacon milk vomit breath 
[03:23:00]  You'd have sour  Bacon milk puke breath  Stephen S. for Basher  Have to sit on one cheek  Does it feel like  Someone just  Pounded sand  Up your asshole  But as you stand  And go  Look I have to get out  Because the chair  In front of you  Is back  So you have to  Kind of lean back  And then as you're  Climbing over the person  You're shitting down  Both pant legs  It's like you have  Fucking uh  Like fucking  Liquid junior mints  Coming out of the  Back of your pants  You leave me a little  Junior mint trail 
[03:23:30]  On the way to the can  Sitting there waiting  Where the fucking  Flight attendants  Hang out  Shit is actually  Coagulating  In the back of your crack  That whole plane  Would stink so bad  And this is fucking  An hour and forty minutes  Into a flight to Australia  You're already  Shitting and throwing up  On yourself  Stephen S.  Pitcher writes  Bacon bra  There's a picture  Of a girl  Wearing a bacon bra  God damn  That's funny  It's a long flight 
[03:24:00]  Sure is  Bacon puke breath  It sure is  Especially if you  Laugh a lot  Like  And just talk  To the girl  Next to you  Picture of Kevin  Bacon  For some reason  Alright Danny  Alright  Bacon sex lube  God damn funny  Nice nice nice  Yeah  Funde bar  I'm not a big fan  Of bacon  In any other form  Than just cooked up  With eggs 
[03:24:30]  That was always good  Holy shit  Why did Ben Stiller  Even come in here  To promote  Night at the museum  Oh I know right  Holy shit  Did you see that  Battle of the Smithsonian  70 million  Thanks to this show  70 million  Wow everyone went  To the movies  Huh  Well because it's  The long weekend  Probably  I think ticket sales  Were actually down  Over last year  No really  Terminator made 54  How about Terminator 
[03:25:00]  Dan you saw that  Right  I did see it  You know  I share a lot  Of the same issues  That a lot of  The critics have  I wouldn't pan it  As heavily as they have  But you know  Look it's Terminator 4  You know  That's what you gotta  Go into it  Realizing it's not  It's not James Cameron  It's not Terminator 1  Or even 2  Which is a close sequel  But it's Terminator 4  Like what do you want  Is the governator in it  Well I'm not gonna  Blow the surprise  For anybody  Wait please blow the surprise  He makes a cameo 
[03:25:30]  In this  No he doesn't  But his likeness does  What  They kinda CG  Him onto a  Onto a terminator  It was cool  You like the movie  It wasn't bad  I mean  In the grand scheme  Of things  It really doesn't  Do much to  Perpetuate the series  Like it kinda  Begins and ends  And it could've  Never existed  But look  It's a summer movie  You're gonna sit there  You're gonna eat your popcorn  There's some great  Action sequences  I mean what do you want  That's how you know  A movie is shit  When you have to start  Describing the activities  You'll be doing  While it's on  Are you gonna put 
[03:26:00]  Your feet up  The air conditioner  Yeah  I mean like  Everybody's trying to  You know  They want Terminator  Salvation to be  Like this be all  End all movie  Like people  They want  Every Terminator  Should top  The previous one  And you know  Look  In this day and age  It just doesn't  Happen anymore  Especially when  The rights to the movies  Have been thrown around  So many times  It just doesn't  Happen anymore  You're looking for  Like we got with  Star Trek  And before that  The reimagining  Of Batman  Stuff like that  So people are thinking 
[03:26:30]  Alright  They're gonna  Completely  Redo  The Terminator  You don't feel  Like you're missing  Anything when you  Go to the bathroom  Well  Maybe that should  Be on a poster  And you know  What  This movie is so good  You'll just  Shit your pants  In the seat  You know  And if you  If you guys  Haven't seen it yet  You know  If you go into  This thinking  That Christian Bale  Is like  You know  The main character  You're kind of wrong  Because he kind of  Shares like a  Co-starring  Supporting role  Almost with  Sam Worthington  Who's really  The main character  Of the film  I was thinking 
[03:27:00]  To Anthony  The third movie  Star Trek  Made another  29 million  And I was at  A little family  Gathering out east  Yesterday  Two days ago  I guess  At this point  And I was thinking  About you  Because one of the  Guys there  Was watching  Star Trek  Enjoying the  Fuck out of it  And his wife  And his kid  Went to another movie  You know how  You do that  Sometimes  Hey I'll see you  After the movie  Their movie  Let out early  So he figured  That the kid  Could sit through  The remainder  Of Star Trek  He only had  20 minutes to go  Kid was losing  His freaking mind  He had to leave  With 20 minutes  Left 
[03:27:30]  In Star Trek  Just make the girl  Go out there  And hold the baby  Cold cock the kid  Wham right in the face  No I mean honestly  They're a cool family  What it was  They made the decision  Like oh I think  You can sit through  The rest  I'm going to go  With the other kid  You know they have  A couple kids  A few kids  And they miscalculated  And he's like  I had to leave  With 20 minutes  Left  In Star Trek  How old is the kid  And right away  I was thinking  About Anthony  I'm not sure  Which one it was  Must be the little one  Probably five 
[03:28:00]  I wouldn't have left  Somewhere  I wouldn't have either  I wouldn't have left  I would have just fucking  I would have really  Duct taped the kid's mouth  Yeah  There are other options  Yeah  Oh is that the CG  Yeah I mean  It's a shitty quality  Eyes  Big head  Picture phone  But uh  Yeah  My biggest problem  I think with this  Particular Terminator series  Was that  A Terminator  As seen in the first  And second installments  Of Terminator  I don't acknowledge  That three existed  But  Yeah I know  A Terminator  Doesn't river dance 
[03:28:30]  This one river danced  Well close  You know  I don't see a reason  For a Terminator  To pick up its target  And throw it into a wall  There's no reason  For that to happen  And that happens  Like four or five times  And apparently  These Terminators  They can be taken out  With half a clip  Of like an M16  Really  Not a problem  That wasn't the case  In the original  No  That was the scary part  They couldn't kill it  Couldn't kill it  But if it's the fourth movie  Maybe the guns got better  They kill  Tens of Terminators  And it's like  It's no problem 
[03:29:00]  No problem  They'll land in helicopters  On them  It's no big deal  I don't think Danny  Liked the movie  I did though  It's not bad  But  I did but  I just have a problem  With some of the  You know  Some of the screenwriting  They should have kept it  A little more true  Terminators should not  Moonwalk and pop walk  Inappropriate  That'll be  Believe me  You're not far off  Terminator 5  Electric Boogaloo  Then you got  Angels and Demons  Did 27  Fourth place  And then Dance Flick  Is that that  Like parody thing 
[03:29:30]  Yeah  That's the one  With the Dwayne's brothers  They have to pump out  A new  God  They gotta make  A new parody  About some movie genre  Every fucking year  Was it good  Anyone see it  Can't be  What was the first  I'm trying to remember  What the first one was  Scary movie  Was it a scary movie  I think so  Yeah  Was there one before that  Because that was  The argument I was  Getting into  A couple days ago  I'm convinced  There was  There was another one  That came out  Before Scary Movie  Scary Movie  I think put those  Type of movies  On the map  The top  But I can't remember  But for some reason  I feel like  There was one before that 
[03:30:00]  Yeah there was  Airplane  There was no  Charlie Sheen movies  But did Airplane  Mock all those  Yeah it was  Making fun of  The airport movies  Sure  And what was  Charlie Sheen's movie  Part 2  Hot shots  Hot shots  There was Major Leagues  Major Leagues  Making fun of  All the baseball movies  Well I don't think  Major League  Wasn't really  A parody thing  Like that  We're talking  Where wow  This scene was  Joke after joke  Oh I see  Shit  They're completely  Mocking this particular  Scene from this  Particular movie  That's what I'm getting at 
[03:30:30]  So do we still go  With some of those  Movies we mentioned  Airplane is as far back  As I could really think  But that was more  A parody  Of the airport movies  In general  No  I'm talking about  Where they go  Almost  Oh dude  If you watched  Airplane  And then Airplane 76  77  78  79  The Concorde  Some of them are  Yeah exact  Okay  Naked Gun  Naked Gun was after  Airplane 
[03:31:00]  Because that kind of  Put him in that  Comedic spotlight  Leslie Nielsen  Leslie Nielsen  Was really funny  And nuts  When he played  A John  And Barbra Streisand  Killed him by accident  Nuts  What are you gonna do  Fuck someone else  Come on  Let's take a nice  Bubble bath  And she's like  He already fucked her  And she wants to  Get rid of him  Because she has  Another client come  And she's like  Oh sweetie  Or whatever  She goes  Don't give me  That whore talk  See if you can find 
[03:31:30]  Leslie Nielsen  In nuts  Let's take a nice  Bubble bath  After he blew his  Load and paid her  He wants to  Stick around the house  Fucking asshole he was  What a dick  And like they got  Into a physical thing  And she killed him  Like with a mirror  She  I forget how he died  But then Richard Dreyfuss  Plays her lawyer  Because she's saying  She's ready to stand trial  And they're saying  That she's crazy  And she can't  Stand trial  Very good movie  It's called  Nuts  With Richard Dreyfuss  And Barbara Streisand 
[03:32:00]  Who's great  Carl Malden's in it  But Leslie Nielsen  Plays the John  At the beginning  Of the movie  As we find that clip  Let's uh  What are you gonna do  Fuck someone else  You got it  No I don't know  What this is  The original charge  Man slaughtered  The original charge  Is not the issue  Psychiatrist reports  Say she's unfit  I don't know  If this is the scene  Now look for  Leslie Nielsen  Nuts  Yeah it's  It's a log  What are you googling  Leslie Nielsen  Nuts  Oh  What are you gonna do  Fuck someone  I think that's what  He said yeah  What do you have to do  Fuck someone else 
[03:32:30]  So vulgar  He was having such a  Ball with him before  And now this  What were these  New Yorkers buzzing  About this holiday weekend  Bees  Oof  Oh  Could do a little  Pop quiz there  Oh well of course  Buzzing  And then  Bees  What were these  New Yorkers buzzing  About this holiday weekend  Bees  Thousands of them  Swarming around a hive  In this lower  Manhattan building  When I got here  It was already  Like a thousand bees 
[03:33:00]  In there  But then they came out  There were more  They were like in a pack  The swarm left employees  In this video game store  Trapped inside for hours  The insects forced them  To close shop  While waiting for help  While officials  Were trying to figure out  How to solve  The unusual problem  A good Samaritan  Was able to lure  About a thousand bees  Into a bag  Which he then put  In a box for safety  But more bees  Streamed out of the building  What were people doing  When you approached this  I don't know  They were laughing 
[03:33:30]  Some of them  You know  Is anyone stung?  Not yet  Well that's a good thing  Stay away  Stay away  Finally  A bee specialist  Showed up  To begin the tough task  Of removing the bees  I'm probably going to be  Relying on scent  On the queen scent  From in here  I'm going to have her  Attract them in  The trick worked  The store was later reopened  The bees meantime  Have been taken to hives  In upstate New York  Can I tell you something?  Sure  The bees  When did you lose?  The second she opened her mouth 
[03:34:00]  That voice of hers  New Yorkers are buzzing  What happened for real?  About bees  I completely  Like completely zoned out  And then I'm like  I realized I was zoning  And I was trying to focus  And I just went somewhere else  You can't  What happened?  Alright bees in a place  Then what happened at the end?  They didn't stop  And then they called  They called a specialist  To get the bees away  And he used the scent  Of a queen bee  To lure the bees away  And then the bees  Went upstate  The end  Dude I started thinking  About bacon again 
[03:34:30]  Bacon  Bacon honey  They did call a bee expert  Yes  Who are  They did  Thank you  At least someone understands  Why I pulled this up  I wonder what they cost  It's probably very expensive  Wait a bee expert  Bee expert  Bee expert  Yeah  I wonder if you'll be able  To get a  Discount bee expert  I don't think there's many  Bee experts  Nah probably not  A lot of buildings  Not a lot of bees  Yeah  Just feel free to call  Ted's Pesky Bee Removal Emporium 
[03:35:00]  Pesky  They're pesky  Yes  The way to get rid of bees  Is I walk right under the hive  And I flail my arm wildly  And yell  Shoo  I put honey on my fingers  But Ted  You're going to get stung  Yes I have Gregory  I was stung 4,000 times once  4,000 times  Yes  That's how I remove the bees  I entice them to sting me  And they die  Where do they sting you?  All over my body and genitals 
[03:35:30]  Why your genitals?  I don't know  I should probably tuck them in  Before I do this  Sometimes I attempt to tinkle  On the bees  As they're swarming me  Why would you have  Your genitals explode?  Because I'm wee-weeing  On the bees, Gregory  I figure that the  Liquid will kill them  Yeah  That's probably a bad thing  I grab the hornet  As I shake it angrily  Hornet's nest  I say  Get out of here  Sometimes I punch it  Oh, jeez  Like a speed bag  They probably come out 
[03:36:00]  They certainly do  They're very upset  One time I was hitting it  And I was making the noise  Wow  And what do you charge  For a bee removal?  I usually charge  Three dollars per bee  That's a lot of money  So I remove the stingers  And add it up  And the money comes  Rolling in  Three dollars a bee  Do you have to go to the hospital  Every time?  Every single time  Sounds like you don't mind 
[03:36:30]  The bee sting  I hate them there  I just scream and yell  Help  So then I have to call  A bee expert with smoke  So why don't you close  Your business?  Because it makes me riches  Makes me riches?  I understand  Well that's  What's it called?  Ted's Pesky Bee Removal Emporium  I also sell bee removing products  Like I sell a stick  For four hundred dollars  And you can poke the nest with it  But anyone can get a stick 
[03:37:00]  Not like this one they can  It's shaped like a big bee  So it lulls them  Into a sense of security  They think their god has arrived  Isn't that what we're hoping for  For a god to arrive  That's fantastic  That's wonderful  Not another teen movie  Not another teen movie  Was one of the best movies  In that genre  You ever see not another teen movie?  That was an after scary movie though  I know  That was after  But I'm just saying in general  I like that one a lot  Oh that's fake Arnold? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah  Yeah he's got like a  Rrrr on his face  He's got a snarl  I mean there wasn't a bad scene  Why'd you give away that part of the movie?  Because we asked  I was not going to say it  Let me think about that  Will I see Terminator?  I'll see it once it's on like  Yeah  On DVD or something  Something like that  Yeah  Let's go home  Yeah let's uh  Let's bolt  As they say  Bolt  Make like a shepherd  And get the flag out of here  Oh  Oh good gosh
