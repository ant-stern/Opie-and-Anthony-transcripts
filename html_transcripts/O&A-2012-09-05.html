<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the Democratic National Convention, focusing heavily on Michelle Obama’s appearance, using vulgar and offensive language.  This segued into a broader critique of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, their tax returns, and the hosts' disdain for government policies.  They also discussed the roles of first ladies and perceived hypocrisy within both political parties,  all while peppered with profanity and inflammatory rhetoric.  A video of a horrific, yet hilarious, boat accident was shown.  Obama's foreign policy, particularly the Bin Laden raid, also drew criticism.

Next, the show shifted to the US involvement in Libya and Syria, with Opie expressing satisfaction over the death of the Libyan leader.  The conversation then turned to the DNC, focusing on the physical appearances of political figures like Bill Clinton and Obama. A trivia-like segment followed, focusing on the deaths of US presidents, often using disrespectful language and analyzing video footage (or lack thereof) of presidential assassinations.  Andrew Dice Clay made a brief, profane appearance, followed by a humorous reading from a fictional "Book of Ted." Opie detailed his experience at the Made in America concert,  including an encounter with Pearl Jam and Jay-Z,  his less-than-ideal concert tickets compared to Ron Howard's, and his time in the rave tent, fueled by Afrojack's music. A significant portion focused on a humorous back-and-forth with "Iraq," the intern supervisor, who repeatedly quit and was talked back into his position.

The show continued with further discussions regarding "Iraq's" ambiguous job status, using superhero/villain analogies.  Opie recounted his rushed departure from the Pearl Jam concert, leading to a discussion of hearing loss and tinnitus. The infamous "F.U. Line" followed, showcasing angry and vulgar caller messages.  Opie's honeymoon (lack of photos), a caller's bad Delta flight experience, and a troubling incident involving a child with Down syndrome being denied boarding on an American Airlines flight were also discussed.  Technical difficulties plagued the show, focusing on malfunctioning phone lines and highlighting Sal's perceived incompetence.

The show then delved into a discussion of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet impact on Jupiter, with a crude joke about the event.  Calls from Brett (about his brother's disruptive behavior) and Vinny (about his autistic son's challenges with air travel) led to discussions of traveling with individuals exhibiting atypical behavior,  the complexities of raising a child with autism, and airline policies regarding reasonable accommodations.  The conversation then turned to aging, sex, and the attractiveness of various celebrities, including vulgar discussions about elderly women's bodies and anal sex.  A mocking "Getting High with Ron Howard and Seth Rogen" segment was included, along with discussions of Jim Norton's stand-up show and a person with Tourette's syndrome on a plane.  Bob Barker's exclusion from the *Price is Right* anniversary special and Vanna White's reduced role and Playboy past were also discussed, leading to further crude jokes about Vanna White's age and attractiveness, with extensive internet searches for imagery of elderly women’s bodies.  The segment concluded with a somber reflection on the Munich Massacre of 1972.

The show revisited the Munich Olympics massacre, then shifted to Vanna White's net worth, the DNC, and a critique of a Ted Kennedy tribute. A nonsensical song about months was briefly discussed.  A segment with CM Punk on *After Opie and Anthony Live* focused on radio station liners and the practices of major radio companies.  Back on the main show, discussions about Wendy Williams, Sal's performance (and subsequent criticism from a caller), and detailed photos from Roland's weekend (including bathing suit photos, urination in a public phone booth, and his Instagram responses) ensued, with Nicole from *Morning Mashup* offering commentary.  Sal eventually agreed to become Eric's "cocksucker" (personal assistant).

The final segment briefly discussed mandalas and their meaning, with one host expressing disinterest. The show concluded with the hosts thanking their crew (Sal, Roland, Troy, Nicole, Eric) and announcing Ron and Fez as the next show.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Oh 
[00:01:00]  Oh  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, we are?  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in a day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the grub.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, asshole, just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Woo!  Let's do it.  I gotta tell you, that Michelle Obama is terrific.  You know, she looked so beautiful last night during her speech.  She's a beauty.  For the Democratic National Convention.  They brought her up.  She was the big part of the show at the end of the convention last night.  The night's convention, it does continue.  And what a capper on the evening. 
[00:05:30]  She just looked fantastic.  She gets prettier every year.  Well, that's what they say.  I don't see it.  She's not ugly.  But let's relax a little bit.  Let me tell you something.  When she walked out, her fucking hips are wider than any fucking,  any person that's supposed to be that size.  She's standing in front of the podium, so you only see from the hips up, right?  And she's in shape. 
[00:06:00]  You know, she got her arm definition and everything.  She apparently does some type of work.  And now, but look at her hips when she turns.  Watch.  Look how wide they are.  Oh, they didn't even show her turn.  They are so wide.  Look at it.  Look how big that is.  I'm not a fan of women that are shaped like pears.  She's shaped like Godzilla.  You know, Godzilla has like that big bottom half and a little.  Oh, your Godzilla is better than mine.  I used to watch Godzilla all the time.  I'm trying, though. 
[00:06:30]  But, yeah, she's got that big bottom and then the little top, you know?  Yeah, and they try to say she's gorgeous and all that.  Oh, because it's racist to not say she's beautiful.  Why?  Why is it racist?  I don't know.  It just is.  I don't think that part is.  Oh, I do.  Oh, I certainly do.  What?  If you say she's not hot or beautiful?  Then you're racist.  No, man.  I like black broads.  Well, that's what I was told.  I like black broads.  People told me.  She's all right.  Well, that's because you didn't use those words, Ant. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, you kind of phrased it differently.  Maybe that was it.  You kind of pepper your language.  Oh, maybe.  That's your problem.  I was tweeting all night during the convention.  I don't think she's bad looking, though, for an older.  Like, I'm not into women in their 50s, but she's all right.  I mean, there's nothing special.  If you saw her fucking without that dress on, holy shit, what a nightmare those hips  would be.  They're giant.  Boy, hips don't lie.  Oh, man.  Hips don't lie.  Bump.  That's funny.  They show her body, and they got arrows pointing to various parts of her body. 
[00:07:30]  And her back, it says hump.  Her tits, it says slump.  The front, it says bump.  And her ass, it says plump.  Hump, slump, bump.  She had a good speech, though, people are saying.  She had every first lady type speech.  People are saying that she had a good speech.  It's that fucking speech that a battered woman tells her friends when she goes back to her  husband.  It's just that rah, rah, he rules speech. 
[00:08:00]  Whatever.  I had some issues with the Democratic and National Convention last night, and not just the fact  that it was Democrats.  Did you have issues with the Republican National Convention, too?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Hell yeah, I did.  Good.  A lot of people try to quiz me on it, and try to trip me up, and call me out.  And I'm like, you know, because last night somebody said something about, I didn't know  you were such a right-wing Republican, fucking, and, yeah, I love abortions. 
[00:08:30]  Who doesn't love a good abortion?  I love the fact that gays can just slam each other's asses and get married and have a great  gay old time, like the Flintstones said.  Love it!  I have no problem with any of that stuff that, like, that the hard right-wing fucking religious  right wants to get in everyone's business of.  I love all that shit.  I just don't like their fucking forcing me to do certain things when it's America, and  it's my fucking choice.  That's what I don't like about that. 
[00:09:00]  Basically, you want to tell the world you don't want to help anybody.  I want to choose who I help.  A lot of their message last night, I'll just go with their message last night, a lot of  it was that if you make it in this country, if you achieve what they say is the American  dream, it's not all about money, and it's about having that door of opportunity open,  and after you walk through, no, don't slam it shut.  You've got to reach back and help people, other people, through.  No!  I don't have to.  If I want to, I will. 
[00:09:30]  It's my fucking choice what I do with my happiness, my prosperity, my fucking success  in this country.  Once I achieve where I am in this country, it's my choice what I want to do to either  help other people or not help.  I'm not keeping anyone down.  I'm not slamming the door of opportunity shut, but I'm not reaching back and pulling  anyone through.  I'm fucking walking.  I'm through the door.  Why not pull one person through?  I have.  I've pulled people through, family members, things like that. 
[00:10:00]  An occasional story I'll read that might, you know, strike a nerve with me.  I'll help those people.  But for the most part, I don't like a government that tells me that I now have to kick in more  into the till to help this motherfucker out.  Not my problem.  If I want to on my own, I'll do it.  But I can't stand this message of you're a fucking prick, a greedy, rich fuck if you  don't reach back and pull other people through your goddamn door of opportunity. 
[00:10:30]  Fuck you.  You're not wrong for thinking that.  I don't think I am.  I think that I think the government's got to take care of their own fucking business  before they start looking for more money from everybody.  You know, I was getting shit on last night for saying that my fair share.  They keep saying that and people have to do their fair share.  You know what?  When everyone pays some form of income tax, everyone that earns and works on the books  and pays their fair share of income tax, then you could come to me if you're still out 
[00:11:00]  a few bucks and ask me if I'd like to contribute a little more.  But until then, and until you clean up your own shit with the corruption and misappropriation  of money and redundant spending, don't ask me for more.  Is Romney really paying 13% or is that a fact, a stat that's been twisted?  Because like guys like that make 15 or 13% they're paying.  I'm sure that's pretty accurate.  Because it's probably just on his capital gains.  He doesn't make money like he has money and he's probably paid a fuckload of taxes on 
[00:11:30]  it over the years, but he doesn't have this job where he files his income tax and, you  know, like a lot of other people, pays taxes on it like everyone knows how.  It's a lot from investments and capital gains taxes, which, you know, vary in percentage depending  on how long you hold an equity or something else.  But for the most part, you know, I don't know, should he open up more of his taxes? 
[00:12:00]  Probably, yeah.  What hasn't he opened up?  He went back two years.  That's all I have to go back?  I guess so.  That's all, you know, I don't even think I have to go back at all.  But I think it's not in his best interest to give the Democrats more fodder.  If they really just wanted to see, but they'll pick every little thing apart.  And if you don't have to give it, why would you give someone something they're just going  to use to fuck you with?  The Democrats are going, we want your tax return. 
[00:12:30]  And then he goes, OK.  And then they look and go, oh, but that's good.  OK, thank you.  But doesn't it say a lot that he doesn't?  It says that he doesn't want to give them some type of because they'll use anything against  it.  They'll pick through his tax thing and say, well, look what he did here.  He deducted this and that.  And it's like, yeah, well, it's legal.  But he also knows it would look bad if he gave that.  Yeah, he has to be ready to defend.  That kind of bugs me if he won't release at all, because I think we have we have the  right.  Most people, we don't have the right to know. 
[00:13:00]  But if you're one of the guys Obama, too, I mean, I want to know plenty of Obama stuff  that he hasn't released.  But I mean, I want to know.  I think they both should be obligated to release every piece of financial information.  Absolutely.  OK, especially if you're going to be president.  Yeah, man, because they make that that's fine.  I think it's fair.  I got no problem with that.  I'm not sitting here saying, you know, fuck that he should.  I'm just saying what I'm sure their reasoning is in his camp is all they will do is use  it against him in some way, shape or form.  Tax returns, especially something as complicated as his must be, are very easy to twist and 
[00:13:30]  turn things to make you look bad.  They're not going to look at them and say, thank you, Mr. Romney.  Here's your tax returns back.  We found nothing here to use against you in the Obama campaign.  I think because with these guys, this is the biggest one.  It looks like this is the biggest rich versus the poor.  Yes.  Like it's it always is kind of like that.  Like they're all rich.  Obama's rich.  Yeah, he's a rich guy.  It always feels like they're two kind of guys of equal. 
[00:14:00]  This feels like poor guy against rich guy, even though it's not.  Oh, absolutely.  It feels like and they're shaping it up to be this battle of the guy that cares.  Right.  And the the corporate ice cube that just fucking doesn't want to do anything for people.  And and, you know, it's it's more of a social battle than anything else.  This is going to be really close, huh?  Yeah, it is.  Holy fuck.  A close one.  It's going to be a close one.  Because, I mean, you know, the big question, are we better off than we were four years ago? 
[00:14:30]  That's a lot of people have been saying.  And a lot of elections go with that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if Obama just had just a slight bump, he's got this thing.  He's got this thing.  Well, it's it's going to be one of those neck and neck right up until the line based on what's said or what isn't said or mistakes that are made or from now until, you know, election day.  Well, let's listen to Michelle Obama.  We got a couple highlights. 
[00:15:00]  Well, everyone's talking about it.  That's true.  She did a good job.  She knows how to speak.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll give her that.  I'll give her that.  You know, she she did as good a job as any first lady does when they got to go up there and rah rah their husband.  She's not going to get up there and fucking go.  And last night when he was punching me in the face for burning the roast, I don't I said, you know, he should have an unburnt roast.  I just don't get the first lady thing.  I don't get it.  It doesn't make sense. 
[00:15:30]  Why are we supposed to listen to them, too?  Yeah, yeah.  Just imagine what you do for a living and then you bring your wife in and now she knows the business.  Yeah.  You know what?  She's married to you.  We should bring our respective girls in at any moment that we're negotiating a contract and have them stand before the bosses and give a speech about what great guys we are.  I don't understand why the first lady gets so much power.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just because she's married to the guy.  Married to the guy.  It's so weird to me. 
[00:16:00]  The woman behind the man.  That was a big thing last night during the opening of the convention was women.  And boy, did they just like, does anyone see through this shit?  And I'm talking the Republican National Convention, too.  What happened?  What happened?  They parade women out there.  Yeah.  Just for the fact that, hey, look, we like women not just because we fuck them and their tits and stuff.  We like them to just hang around and work and they should make as much money and they should. 
[00:16:30]  It's just we want to show the world we respect them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they paraded all of these women on stage last night.  Literally paraded them.  They were in line on the stage.  I was watching.  A bunch of the women.  They all came up and spoke individually.  And it's all I think it was the great neon taster on Twitter who said, it looks like they all busted through the glass ceiling with their faces.  Some ugly broads up there? 
[00:17:00]  Which got me chuckling.  Yes.  Are you allowed to say there were ugly broads up there?  The Democratic women.  Now, the Republican women at the convention, I noticed, all looked like lunch ladies.  Right.  Just old, white-haired women.  And even the younger women were dressed like very conservatively and stuff.  This crowd is fat.  The Democratic women at this convention, these delegates.  How are the Democrats eating better?  They're fat.  How are they eating better?  I don't know.  Shouldn't the Republicans be eating better?  You'd think.  You'd think. 
[00:17:30]  The Democratic convention has a bunch of women sitting there, the delegates and whatnot, that are fat.  And, you know, they all have that hairdo that's just very easy to manage.  I don't like that attractive long hair.  I like a short bob that's easy to wash and get back on my way.  Was it that obvious?  Oh, God.  The hairdos between the two parties?  Yes.  It really was.  I wasn't watching that closely, to be honest with you.  I was watching with a microscope. 
[00:18:00]  I am.  I'm sure you are.  Well, let's get some highlights from the Michelle Obama speech.  Yes, Michelle.  Like, like so many American families, our families weren't asking for much.  Oh, could you stop for a second?  Sorry.  Listen during this whole thing.  Her on the verge of crying, whining sound, she gets to her voice.  This is, she's like, and I, and I think what he's doing, it's this dramatic, whiny, this is very important, what I'm saying, affectation to her voice. 
[00:18:30]  And I want to just remind you over and over again, both sides do this horse shit.  No, they're both full of shit with their presentations.  Oh, yeah.  Do you know there was a guy, just real quick, at the Comedy Cellar podcast last night who they interviewed, who wrote a book on morality.  And he was talking about the liberals and the conservatives and how, and he was very interesting.  Noam did a great job interviewing him.  He talked about, and I'm not going to quote him part, but just about how the conservatives and the liberals, those people all have kind of, I guess he was saying they both have morality, but what it is that drives them. 
[00:19:00]  And like conservatives are more group oriented, like they protect the group and liberals are more victim oriented.  He was really gut into it.  We should interview this guy because he didn't seem to be too biased either way.  But I obviously thought of having him on.  I just, I had to go home because I was tired.  Let's try to get him on, man.  And be rude to him.  So you sort of listened to the podcast.  Yeah, I was on it for a few minutes, but I wound up going on stage, and then I'm, I'm so, no, but you're right though. 
[00:19:30]  I was so tired.  I was like, I'm going to go home and go to bed.  Didn't begrudge anyone else's success or care that others had much more than they did.  In fact, they admired it.  They simply believed in that fundamental American promise.  That even if you don't start out with much, if you work hard and do what you're supposed to do, you should be able to build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids and grandkids. 
[00:20:00]  That's all well and good, but then the government turns around and tries to fuck you over.  Right, right.  So that doesn't make so much sense.  Yeah.  What happened?  The boat thing that's been all over.  That's what I was telling Danny.  Did you see the boat crash video?  No, it's hilarious.  Holy fuck.  Nice tits in there.  It's horrific and hilarious at the same time, and then it goes to just hilarious.  Yes.  When you realize everyone survived the boat crash, then it's beyond hilarious. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I tweeted.  We should get it on our Facebook page, E-Rock.  You got it on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  It'll be up there in minutes, right?  Yep.  Just in case you haven't seen it.  It'll be down a ways on my fucking Twitter.  But it is up there if you want to search it out.  That's how they raised us.  That's what we learned from their example.  We learned about dignity and decency. 
[00:21:00]  Dignity.  That how hard you work matters more than how much you make.  That helping others means more than just getting ahead yourself.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  What did she just say there?  Even though what she says sounds right.  It sounds right.  It's nice to say that, but it's not what our government's supposed to do.  It's not what the government's supposed to do, motherfucker.  Can you rewind that a little bit?  I'll show you what that is.  Yeah.  Here's the boat crash.  I mean, just for these guys in studio, because they haven't seen it.  Yeah, I've not seen this.  And this is real, huh?  Yes.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  It's some kind of GoPro or something on the front of the boat.  Oh, that's great.  And, yeah, just play it.  Full screen.  What's the matter with you?  The boat slammed from side to side, causing injuries to the driver and six passengers.  Watch the driver just go flying and give up on his own boat.  We have exclusive footage of the graphic accident filmed by our own Lake TV crew.  Oh!  Wow!  Oh, shit!  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Oh, gosh! 
[00:22:00]  Her face went into that other girl's ass!  Yeah, it probably saved her life, though.  Yeah.  Hitting the ass instead of the side of the boat.  They must have hit a boat wave.  Five were taken to Lake Regional Hospital for the treatment of minor to moderate injuries.  That's hilarious.  The boat didn't flip or anything, right?  No, it went sideways.  No, man.  It hit some weird fucking wave.  Oh, wow.  And the boat driver guy just fucking abandoned.  He just laid down.  He couldn't even stay up.  He was slammed down.  Unbelievable.  That thing is everywhere.  It's on our Facebook page if you haven't checked it out. 
[00:22:30]  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Like us, please.  Oh, you want me to go back here?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, man, it's tough to help others when the government has taken so much.  Very tough.  And I don't trust the government with my fucking money.  That's the problem.  I agree.  Yep.  How hard you work matters more than how much you make.  That helping others means more than just getting ahead yourself.  We learned about honesty and integrity. 
[00:23:00]  That the truth matters.  That you don't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules.  And success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square.  Okay, that's right.  And she's attacking the mentality that someone who makes $40 million a year pays 5% or whatever it is.  And I agree with that.  But the problem is guys that make themselves and work really hard are getting fucked in the process. 
[00:23:30]  It's like you're not just attacking fucking trust fund kids who are handed everything.  You're also going after people who work seven days a week and make their money.  I don't want to give any of my fucking more money away.  I'm sick of it.  Yeah.  I'm sick of people taking more money.  I really am.  And a lot of what I was hearing last night, because I was tweeting all night during this,  and a lot of what was coming back to me was stuff like, oh, what, you don't just want to give a little more? 
[00:24:00]  How much more?  Is a little more?  Because it's always a little more.  Right.  No, and you know what?  No, I'm done.  I don't.  And I'm not looking for a tax break.  Like they're saying, Romney wants to give tax breaks to the wealthy.  No.  He just wants to extend what is already there.  And Obama wants to take away what's already there.  So Obama wants to raise taxes.  That's what he wants to do.  That's where I'm in agreement with you, by the way.  I've given enough.  Yeah, absolutely.  Fix your broken shit. 
[00:24:30]  And then if it looks like you guys are really trying to spend your money wisely, and everybody  is putting in their fair share, even someone that makes fucking 20,000 a year can pay their  fair share.  I'm not saying pay a fuckload, but what's fair for someone that makes 20 grand to live in  this great nation and be patriotic and pay for the fucking roads and everything else that  we enjoy in this country? 
[00:25:00]  That I'm supposed to foot the bill for.  No.  How about you fucking put in a small percentage to just in good faith show that you're part  of the solution to, instead of just bitching and whining that everyone else isn't doing  their fair share.  Blow me.  I think both sides are just brainwashing voters.  I think we should focus on the fact that the government is not doing the right thing by  us.  Exactly.  They are wasting our fucking money. 
[00:25:30]  Yes.  Because they can't figure out their own business.  Yes.  And when they can't figure out their own business, they need more money.  So guess what?  Oh, they come after us.  Come after the people that the haves.  That's what they call them.  The haves and the have nots.  Well, it's not just rich people.  The middle class is fucking suffering.  They don't have enough fucking money either.  No, I know.  But it's just infuriating.  So then you've got to decide which party is going to be better. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  But to me, it doesn't seem like it gets that much better either way.  No, it doesn't.  That's where I'm at.  But I'm just sick of the fucking...  And the great part is the Democrats will tell you that the Republicans love telling you  what to do.  You know, as far as a woman's body goes.  You know, all that religious shit that they talk about.  But, I don't know. 
[00:26:30]  The Democrats have a great way of getting right in there in your fucking life and just  stirring shit around.  A lot of this religious right shit, it's despicable.  It's very hard to get past the American people.  Very hard to pull away Roe versus Wade.  Believe me, I bet it's a hard thing to do.  But as far as boosting taxes up so I could help people through the door, that's pretty  easy for a politician to do.  I got a solution. 
[00:27:00]  What's that?  Two presidents.  Oh, co-presidents.  Co-presidents.  Groovy.  One Democrat, one Republican.  Wow, that would be fun.  And force these guys to lock them in a room with a problem.  You get one problem a day.  Right.  You lock them in the room.  Right.  And they have to do whatever they need to do with each other, whether it's fighting  or gay sex.  Preferably twins, by the way.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Preferably twins.  So you're not influenced by... 
[00:27:30]  Whittles the field down?  So you're not influenced by one guy maybe being, I don't know, better looking or hard to  look at or whatever the fuck.  All right.  Two presidents is the solution in this country.  Because both sides have good ideas.  Yeah, you know, for the most part.  Mix and match would be nice.  I want to go a la carte.  You can't.  You can't go a la carte.  Nope.  Well, isn't that kind of stupid?  I'll take their shit.  Isn't it kind of stupid you got to go party line when most of us don't agree with everything 
[00:28:00]  that one side has to offer?  I'll say it now just to avoid everybody else.  What about Ron Paul?  You bet you got Ron Paul.  Third party, baby.  That's the third party.  That's the one you should throw your vote away on.  He's going to be launching what?  Today?  Is he launching today?  Good for him.  He's launching third party.  I like Ron Paul, though.  I like him, too.  I like what he has to say.  I like his stance on a lot of things.  The Republicans.  Yeah, the government.  Democrats, too, I think, though.  Yeah.  He's a weird dude. 
[00:28:30]  I love the third party guys that just fuck over candidates.  I know.  It's the best.  Because they don't have a shot at winning.  He takes from both.  But eventually, a third party guy will have a damn good shot.  Eventually.  Yeah.  Not this time around.  Unfortunately, it just takes so much fucking money.  That's what it's come down to.  And it's not a recent thing.  This has been a thing that's gone on for a while.  But it takes so much money to run for president.  You need to be on TV and have your face there and ads all the time. 
[00:29:00]  But, Anthony, when I was growing up and I was going to school at Washington Drive, they said anyone could be president.  Anyone could be president.  You, too.  That's the beauty of America.  If you work hard enough.  They looked at everyone in that classroom and said, any one of you could be the president of the United States of America.  And then did you go like, oh, me?  And you look around the room and go, oh.  And then I think the teacher whispered, as long as you have a billion dollars.  Yeah, you need pretty much a billion dollars.  What teach?  What was that?  Nothing, nothing. 
[00:29:30]  And you better hope you look good.  You better hope you can speak well.  You better hope.  I'm becoming a curmudgeon.  I just think it's all.  A curmudgeon.  I really am.  I think it's all just bullshit at this point in my life.  It's poppycock.  Just a curmudgeon.  I don't believe.  Why, you?  I don't believe in either side.  I'm sorry.  I just don't.  No, I don't believe in either side.  But I.  Well, you like one side better than the other.  And that's fine.  That's fine.  Yeah.  And here's another thing I was trying to convey last night on Twitter. 
[00:30:00]  It's very difficult with 140 characters.  Obama's been campaigning for a while now, as we know.  Right.  And he's been taking a lot of heat for the economy.  And he's pawned it off on, you know, George W. Bush and whatnot.  That's all well and fine.  Whatever he wants to do.  But he's campaigning.  And everybody else on the convention last night was rah-rah-ing this whole thing.  That Obama's the one that can take care of the economy. 
[00:30:30]  We've got to move forward on this.  And that he has the job.  You're not talking about a guy that isn't in there yet that can't do something.  He's had the job.  Right.  And the economy still stinks.  And unemployment is still where it was, pretty much where it was when he got into office.  And I think we've talked about it.  I don't think a president should be allowed to campaign while he has the job.  Imagine us, right?  We're negotiating. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Imagine now.  We're like, you know what?  We've got a fucking campaign to continue here at SiriusXM.  So we're not going to be on the air.  We're not going to do the show.  We're not doing the show.  That's crazy.  We're just going to tell people how great the show is going to be when we get on.  We have to campaign for another two years or whatever the fuck it'll be if we can work some shit out.  And this show is going to be entertaining and funny.  You've got to stick with us as a show.  Right.  Well, why aren't you doing the show?  Because I'm here to tell you that our show is the best show.  What?  He's in a tough spot because he has to campaign and sacrifice not doing the job. 
[00:31:30]  But if he does the job slightly better, then he's guaranteed a win here.  Right.  What do you do?  What do you do?  It's crazy.  What do you do?  Instead of flying all over and having fucking dinner with idiots that have money.  Yeah.  I want to go to one of those.  I want to go to one of those.  I want to be one of those idiots with money.  You could go to one, dude.  Easy.  You want to go?  You could go.  That's a presidential thing?  I would mock the whole thing. 
[00:32:00]  I've already met a president.  I don't need to meet another president.  Have you met a president?  Oh, that's right.  I met one president.  No, you haven't.  You haven't.  You're right.  I met a Scott Greenstein.  Oh.  Yuck.  Oh, did that come out of my mouth?  Here's more Michelle Obama.  All right.  That's who we are.  What?  And standing before you four years ago, I knew that I didn't want any of that to change if  Barack became president.  Well, today, after so many struggles and triumphs and moments that have tested my husband in 
[00:32:30]  ways I never could have imagined, I have seen firsthand that being president doesn't  change who you are.  No, it reveals who you are.  Stay a privileged Ivy League couple.  Oh, sorry.  What is she talking about there?  We all know Obama is a nice guy.  Well, that's the first lady's job.  But I don't think anyone would question that.  I think between Romney and Obama, Obama has more of a personality. 
[00:33:00]  I think he's a prick.  They did a big cover story on, I think, Time Magazine this week on Romney, and that was  the Republican issue.  And it was pretty interesting to read.  They said Romney, because at Bank Capital, he's like a numbers cruncher.  That's what he does.  They said there's so few risks.  Many things he could have done that were risky, he backed off on until he had 100% of the  numbers.  He's one of those guys, which is one reason that maybe he doesn't weigh in on certain  things. 
[00:33:30]  I'm not saying that's right or wrong.  But until he has all what he sees as all the facts, he's a guy that's not going to go  out there and just make a risky investment.  And he didn't do that when he was even working with Bank Capital, which maybe is not a good  quality for the president.  If you ask a lot of Democrats, they will assume that what Romney was doing at Bank Capital was  illegal.  Absolutely.  They think there was some type of scandal or something illegal that went on at Bank Capital  because of the way it's been presented. 
[00:34:00]  The guy did his job.  He did his job.  Everyone's job isn't to help other fucking people.  And it doesn't make you a prick if what you're doing doesn't help other people.  It helps your company.  It helps the corporation.  It helps you.  And in turn, it winds up helping other people.  Let me ask you this question.  Sure.  Because you know more.  Does Romney help the middle class in the end?  In the end, I think it'll help the middle class, because if the economy does get better 
[00:34:30]  and he's more of a business oriented person than Obama is, I mean, Obama never even fucking  held a real job.  He never ran a business.  He doesn't know what it's even like to have to come up with a payroll.  But that scares people, too.  They said, like, again, they said when it's legal, because everything Romney has done  is legal.  On his tax returns, it's all legal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that almost pisses people off more because you feel like this.  People don't like it when they feel like, and this is the thing I'm talking about in the 
[00:35:00]  middle class here, when they think the system is stacked together.  Like, when it looks like, yes, that was legal, and look what he got away with, you feel like  it's stacked against you.  And that makes people very resentful, too.  I think there's more misappropriation and corruption and whatnot on the bottom end than the top  end these days.  Holy fuck.  It's ridiculous.  I don't know.  Does he help the middle class?  I don't know.  I think he does.  I think if the economy does get better, the middle class has helped. 
[00:35:30]  More jobs.  Is that like trickle down, though, like Reagan?  Yeah.  People say trickle down doesn't work.  I don't know.  In the microcosm that is my life, I see it work.  I see I earn money, and I spend money on things because I earn money.  The less money I earn, or the more money that's taken from me, the less I will spend on things.  That's pretty much how everything works.  So how does trickle down?  Trickle down has become this catchphrase of something that doesn't work, and it's something 
[00:36:00]  the wealthy want.  So I don't even like using it.  It's just the way it is when you make money and spend money, it helps those that you're  spending money on.  If you're not making money and don't spend money, it hurts people that you were spending  money on.  How much more fucking simple could it be put?  And if you ask anybody, they'll say, yeah, that's trickle down.  The money's got to go somewhere.  Didn't he have a lot of money in offshore accounts and stuff, too?  Again, maybe I would do that, too, if I was him, but I'm not running for president.  I'm not going to be in a position where I'm just asking, I've heard he had money on offshore 
[00:36:30]  accounts, and just this shady shit that people do.  I've heard shit.  I haven't seen anything.  I haven't seen any hard evidence of that, but...  That he has to open up his books, then.  If he did, it's amazing that, yeah, that he would do that, but...  Again, it might be...  If he did, I'm sure it's legal.  I don't think he's stupid enough to have him in legal places.  There is a shadiness to it, right?  And it's probably to protect against the fucking unbelievable taxes.  I mean, and I'm not blaming the taxes on Obama. 
[00:37:00]  I'm blaming it on everybody that's been in office since we've had fucking income tax.  Because all they've done is jack it up.  It's the government's ATM.  The second they have a shortage or need money for something, they go to the till and boost  that fucking tax up higher, and just, instead of fixing their shit, don't fix the leak.  Keep pouring water in.  That's pretty much it.  I agree.  And I'm sick of it.  More Obama. 
[00:37:30]  Michelle.  When people ask me whether being in the White House has changed my husband, I can honestly  say that when it comes to his character and his convictions and his heart, Barack Obama  is still the same man I fell in love with all those years ago.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, really?  A guy that goes to a church where the guy hates America?  His Reverend White?  The same guy? 
[00:38:00]  Really?  But why is she saying that?  Right, Reverend White.  Right, White.  Oh, well, see, I said White.  Oops.  Why is she, why is she, this doesn't need to be said by her.  But this is what First Ladies do.  They just rah-rah their mans.  Yeah.  Same thing fucking Romney did.  I liked that Ann Romney until you see her close up and then you see all the fucking,  like.  Oh, is the lipstick wicking up her, the wrinkles?  It's like a dry lake bed around her mouth.  That's pretty bad, yeah. 
[00:38:30]  But before that, I was like, you know what?  There's someone in her 60s, not bad.  Whoa, what the fuck is that?  Come on, is that Photoshop?  No, that's her, without all the nice lighting and stuff.  Someone used the smudge tool?  Someone used the smudge tool?  Well, that's just a bad gummy picture.  That's pretty bad.  I mean, but when she was doing her speech, look at that, that's all right.  That's all right right there.  But then they showed her in the audience with, you know, close up and, wow. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  All those lips are extremely dry.  You know what that means, right?  Oh, what?  Down below.  Oh.  Wet mouth means wet snitch?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that.  Yeah, lips are showing what they got down below.  Wow.  You didn't know that?  No, I've got to look next time.  He's the same man who started his career by turning down high-paying jobs and instead working in struggling neighborhoods where a steel planet shut down. 
[00:39:30]  I'm sorry.  I just don't believe that.  No one turns down high-paying jobs.  He's like, nope.  He might have turned down high-paying jobs because something was not right about it.  Yeah.  But not just because it's a high-paying job.  There's something there.  There's no way.  I'm sorry.  High-paying job, why you?  I'm insulted.  ...neighborhoods where a steel planet shut down fighting to rebuild those communities and get folks back to work. 
[00:40:00]  Because for Barack, success isn't about how much money you make.  It's about the difference you make in people's lives.  Maybe.  To you.  What are you...  Maybe to you.  They're pretty rich, aren't they?  Yeah.  I think he paid 1% in charities also on his tax return and Romney paid like fucking 15.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's definitely a disparity there.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Because he got to vote for Romney now.  Well, his charitable contribution is making sure we all pay large taxes.  So, you know.  One more clip from Michelle Obama's speech.  If immigrants could leave behind everything they knew for a better life on our shores.  If women could be dragged to jail for seeking the vote.  If a generation could defeat a depression and define greatness for all time.  If a young preacher could lift us to the mountaintop with his righteous dream. 
[00:41:00]  And if proud Americans can be who they are.  And boldly stand at the altar with who they love.  Then surely...  Gays, gays.  Surely...  We can give everyone in this country a fair chance at that great American dream.  They have it.  Stop.  Holy fuck.  How much more fair you wanted?  Jesus Christ. 
[00:41:30]  Tired of these people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to help.  Fuck you.  Tired of it.  God.  That was an alright speech, I guess.  Nah.  Fucking A.  I tell you what, a wacky looking crowd.  They love their wacky hats.  The Democrats.  They're all about the hats.  They were wearing wacky fucking light-up hats and funny glasses with blinking LEDs all  over them.  They like to have more fun. 
[00:42:00]  Look at that woman.  She's allowed to fucking vote.  Who does she look like?  Oh, God.  It's a guy, first of all.  She's not...  She looks like the guy that sang the thong song.  Cisco?  It's Cisco.  Cisco, maybe.  Cisco.  The white hair.  Oh, God.  Well, that other dope that's on that dopey show.  Which one?  Black dude from The Voice.  CeeLo.  Oh, CeeLo, yeah.  Oh, CeeLo.  Looks a little CeeLo-ish.  Yeah, she does it like CeeLo.  She's a very unattractive lady. 
[00:42:30]  I was told the Democrats have a lot more fun at these things than the Republicans.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they really...  Oh, that repressed sex thing.  They really enjoy themselves.  When they get behind closed doors, I'm sure those Republicans are just fucking everybody.  It's a shitty choice, though.  You got to either choose to give up more taxes and let the government control more of your  life, or you got to choose to be with fucking a bunch of people who are pretty much anti-gay,  anti-abortion.  It's like there's no...  Yeah, yeah.  I either choose my own financial security and comfort at the risk of all the social stuff 
[00:43:00]  I believe in, or I go with the social shit and I give up way more of my money than I...  What a terrible fucking choice that is.  And if you say that you don't want to give up more of your money, then you're a prick.  You're like a...  You're one of the...  You're part of the problem.  No, I just...  You know what?  This isn't a guarantee.  Do you think I want to fucking...  In a few years, you want to be sitting around thinking, wow, I had so much money.  Boy, if the government didn't take so much, I would still have it. 
[00:43:30]  You know, things happen.  You've got to make your own security at some point.  The government isn't going to take care of you.  Ugh.  She also looks like Desmond Tutu.  Maybe that's what I'm thinking of.  Yeah.  But I have zero guilt over my money because...  And again, first of all, I don't make the kind that classifies you as fucking over-the-top wealthy  by any stretch.  I think you do.  Oh, boy.  No, I do well.  Not what you think.  Oh, boy, do we.  But you make enough that you're considered one of the...  You would be affected by these taxes.  But there's nobody I'm not comfortable defending myself against. 
[00:44:00]  I work seven days a week.  Like, I don't ever feel guilty about making money because I work for it.  Oh, poor baby.  You're on a stage telling some jokes and then you've got to work here four hours.  Poor baby.  But all the money given to me is given by people who choose to show up at my shows.  Like, my money doesn't come from anybody.  I don't bleed out of the economy.  Whatever I make, if nobody shows up, I don't make money.  Dude, you're just selfish and greedy, keeping your fucking money.  Well, you know, a few bucks more to help other people out. 
[00:44:30]  What's your problem?  I've given more than enough.  I've given enough.  I'm fine with helping other people.  Where it gets to a point where they're just not handling the money I give them, the solution  is not to take more.  And here's the third tweet.  Oh, shut up, faggot.  And that's from me to me.  Bill and Comac, no one thinks...  Oh, Bill!  No one thinks what was done at Bain was illegal, stupid.  No, they do.  It proves that this asshole has done nothing but destroy companies and jobs, not create them. 
[00:45:00]  Destroy companies and jobs.  That's what...  Ah, the evil Mitt Romney.  Shut up!  What the fuck has Obama done?  Four fucking years, motherfucker!  What did Bain Capital do?  I know that a venture capital company...  Look at Liberty.  Look what Liberty's gonna do this place.  That's what Bain did.  But don't they...  So basically, he's just a fucking...  Opportunist, right?  An opportunist CEO.  Is he like a Gordon Gekko in Wall Street? 
[00:45:30]  That's what he's been portrayed as.  But I mean, is that accurate to that job?  Here you go.  A liquidator.  I don't know.  Here it is.  You have a company that isn't doing well.  In some circumstances, ready to fold.  They come in without any fucking personal...  What am I looking for?  Some...  Like, personal emotional attachment to the company.  They look at the numbers.  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.  And fucking keep the company going. 
[00:46:00]  Or get it running again.  Get it profitable.  And then sell it.  It's like you would do to turn a house.  So why would a guy like that want to be president?  I know there's guys like that in our country, but...  Because after $200 million, it's hard to...  It's like you got the money.  You're powerful.  It's just the next step.  He's been a governor.  Yeah.  I've been a governor.  I don't know how I feel about that.  Like, I know that it's legal.  And I know that it is a legit thing.  And a lot of times, companies failing, they're going under anyway. 
[00:46:30]  There are a few companies that I know of also that he...  That Bain Capital helped and are prospering today.  But aren't they by and large...  And this is this type of job.  Don't they by and large, for lack of a better word, gobble up companies.  Like you said, cut, cut, cut, cut.  Yeah.  Fire anything.  And then make it nice and lean and sell it.  Or do they liquidate it as well?  Like, will they go in...  Like, not that Liberty would do that. 
[00:47:00]  Let's just say a big company takes over here and says,  Fuck this satellite radio thing.  These satellites can be used for better things.  Just gut the entire company and use the satellites to do...  And piece out everything.  Whatever.  I'm sure if it's looked at like, this isn't even a viable company anymore.  Like, there's no real need for it or no demand for it.  How could you then rebuild it?  Then you, yeah, you dismantle it and fucking get rid of it.  There is a certain hatred I have for those people.  I know you do, yeah.  When you watch Wall Street, again, Michael Douglas, they're playing a Hollywood, Oliver Stone perception of that guy. 
[00:47:30]  He probably played it nice, to be honest with you.  Michael Douglas?  Yeah, it's probably uglier.  Michael Douglas is a pretty funny guy.  No shit.  That's why I'm saying that.  I bet you it's even worse than his portrayal.  The thing I did...  At Wall Street, he won the Oscar for it.  But he said things that only someone who hates him would say.  Right.  Like things like, it's a zero-sum game, buddy.  Like all these things that people who don't like...  Like, you would never say that about yourself.  You would find the good shit you do.  Nobody wants to think they're fucking... 
[00:48:00]  They're fucking pricks.  But I don't know how I feel about those guys.  Even though what they do is legal, and I'm sure it's legit, there's a certain fucking...  There's a certain hatred I have for that mentality.  Well, they see the blood.  Like, if a company's making $10 million a year, they're like, it should be making $12 million a year.  Maybe they're right, and as an investor, I would want them to be right.  But then they just fucking fire all these people, and that just hurts the economy.  I'd rather have a racist community organizer as president.  You're right.  Fuck that guy. 
[00:48:30]  I'd rather have a racist community organizer that has never done any fucking thing as president.  That's good.  With a biased opinion of people and things.  Obama's racist?  Obama's racist?  I think at least he was a lot more honest about his racial...  I think he was a lot more honest about where he put his racial priorities back in what I call the day when he was a community organizer 
[00:49:00]  than he is now because he's got to appeal to white people because that's what he needs to get elected again.  But back in the old days of Chicago, it was total cronyism.  Total fucking cronyism.  I don't...  But he hasn't been...  I wouldn't say he's been the black president.  Like, he's black, but he hasn't been...  No, I haven't looked at it like, oh my god, look what blacks are doing.  Like, it hasn't felt like that.  And I'm not saying I want Obama and I don't like Romney.  I just...  These are things...  This mentality of this fucking...  You're just throwing thoughts out there.  Yeah, because I have a real hatred... 
[00:49:30]  Guys like that, I think, have done more damage.  Guys that have just gobbled up companies and spit them out.  Well, what scares me when someone comes in and fixes a company, you have to be in the inner circle to benefit from that.  Look what happens here, without going into details.  There are guys making a shitload of money upstairs.  Yeah.  Shitload.  You know, the company's been getting better year after year, but the guys actually, you know, doing the grunt work, you know, like ourselves and other shows.  We're not capitalizing on that like they are. 
[00:50:00]  That's what scares me.  The stack is zero.  But if you get in on the inner circle, then holy fuck, your life is fucking set.  Yeah.  I've read the articles on what some of these guys are, you know, making.  Yeah.  From shares and whatnot.  Yeah.  It's hard to empathize with them.  It would be nice in a perfect world.  You come in, you make a company better than the famous trickle-down shit where, no, now everyone benefits.  But we don't, yeah.  Well, I can only talk about what I see in my dumb little life. 
[00:50:30]  And what I see here, if it's a microcosm of what's going on in America, it's scary.  You're in the inner circle, though, man.  Fuck.  You're going to eat very well.  I just don't like this way it's being presented, like we said earlier, as this, you know, the do-gooder, caring man against the stone corporate motherfucker when it's not.  Right.  I mean, Obama, please.  He's not this gentle man that's, you know, he's definitely got an agenda. 
[00:51:00]  And for the country itself, I'm not as paranoid as a lot of these other people who think Obama's just going to roam around and try to get the hammer and sickle on the fucking flag.  But he does have a vision for this country that I don't appreciate and a lot of other people don't appreciate because it's against what I think the free market is all about and free will is all about.  Who do you trust more foreign policy-wise?  Foreign policy-wise, I always trust a president that is a little more feared than not. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, good.  So Obama.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  I think so.  Obama's got some things done, though.  Yeah, man.  You can't deny that.  He's not been – I thought he would be this fucking soft overseas – I don't trust – I don't think Romney has displayed zero foreign policy knowledge.  I'm surprised with what Obama has done.  Yeah, me too.  Very surprised.  I didn't think he had it in him.  Even if they pushed him to do it.  Like, I think the seals of the book is saying some stuff that might not be kind about Obama. 
[00:52:00]  I don't care.  The bottom line is even if he had to be pushed or his arm had to be twisted in private meetings, he did it.  No one in office was not taking out fucking bin Laden.  No one as president was not going to do it.  But I think that – you're right.  But I think that the risk he took was in the thing – again, this is my fucking layman's knowledge – was that he said no to just using bunker busters because he didn't think Pakistan would help us recover the bodies. 
[00:52:30]  Like, he did what he knew was going to humiliate an ally, a quote-unquote ally who we know is shitty.  What he did he knew was going to humiliate them.  He didn't work with them.  He didn't fucking bow to it and think, well, we got to tell Pakistan because the bigger picture is Pakistan.  And it wasn't 100% that it was bin Laden.  They thought it was him and they were pretty sure, but I read the breakdown of the people.  There was a lot of people saying don't go in there because it's not him.  We don't know if it's him. 
[00:53:00]  So he wasn't 100% sure.  Anyone would have done it if it was 100%.  Of course.  But the risks he took was that it wasn't bin Laden, that he invaded in a weird way.  He went into a fucking country.  Well, that isn't this amazing thing.  Yes, there's going to be risks with any operation like that.  You might fuck it up.  You might fucking be wrong.  That's what every president has to deal with with every operation.  Nothing's ever 100%.  But every president that's ever committed troops to do something like that knows that.  You don't give Obama credit at all for that one?  No. 
[00:53:30]  I really don't.  Wow.  I give.  Wow.  How about the fact that he inherited a bunch of years of intelligence being in place to find out where Obama,  Osama bin Laden, was.  Oh, well, he inherited that intelligence information from Bush.  Oh, we don't hear that.  We hear about what are the bad things he inherited.  But we don't hear the fact that, you know, he'd been looked for.  He got away.  There was nothing.  But the fact is, the intelligence that was in place at that time found the courier that was going back and forth to this fucking place in Pakistan. 
[00:54:00]  And they were like, hey, I think this could be the guy.  But this was in place.  Bush put that shit in place.  But the thing was, and this is where I disagree with Trump when he called in, they did not have 100% knowledge that it was him.  If he was in a Pakistan fucking cave and they killed him, I would give, again, I agree.  Any president does that.  If they had gone to Pakistan and said, look, we know he's here. 
[00:54:30]  We're coming in.  I'm glad they didn't do that either.  Any president would have done that.  The fucking fact is, they snuck in.  They said, fuck you to Pakistan.  They not only killed him, they got his body and they fucking dragged it out of there.  They took all the intelligence out of there.  And they would have got his family, but the helicopter.  That's why they didn't do the Bunker Buster.  Bunker Buster would have been safer militarily, though.  Because they needed.  But Jimmy, you're believing what the government is telling you.  Man.  How do you know we got him?  You think he got him.  According to the dictator, we didn't get him. 
[00:55:00]  Thanks for your service.  Right?  Yeah.  According to the dictator, that movie you forced me to fucking watch, Anthony.  Anyway, Osama bin Laden's still alive.  Oh, boy.  And living in one of the dictator's houses right now.  Yeah, yes.  And just like Jimmy Carter takes the hit for that failed military mission.  Yeah.  And he does take the hit for that.  Obama, I think, gets credit for this.  I mean, and if it would have failed, and it wouldn't have been him, and these troops would have been killed,  he would have been seen.  Not one conservative would have said, hey, any president would have tried that. 
[00:55:30]  Right, right.  They would have said, this blundering asshole non-military leader has got to be ousted.  So there's a line.  Can we be honest, though?  Yeah.  Any president would have went for it, except for Jimmy Carter.  Oh, hell.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Poor guy.  Jesus.  He showed some balls, though, and it just didn't work out.  Yeah, well.  He tried.  He did.  It was back in the day where those things weren't that easy, you know?  It's not that easy now.  History will look back and say, well, at least he tried.  At least he tried.  Jimmy Carter, at least he tried. 
[00:56:00]  He gave it the whole, it was eight lives.  I mean, it wasn't like he had 200 people killed.  Oh, Jimmy.  I didn't have none of that GPS shit.  Right.  He's all like, he didn't have all that fun, good military shit that they got now.  But what was it they got?  It was something to do with the helicopter?  Was it the sand or something?  Sand got all kicked up into the filters, and they got clogged, and their visibility was  down to nothing with all the sand.  They weren't in the right place.  It was bad, yeah.  Same thing here.  Two instant feedbacks, if you go with Louie in Stony Point, North Carolina, Jimmy and 
[00:56:30]  Opie have drunk the Kool-Aid, man, Anthony's right on target, and then, that's why, that's  so silly, and then the next, literally the next fucking feedback, now the black guy is  the racist, you fucking suck, Anthony.  The black guy is the racist.  But I'm not, how is it I've drunk the Kool-Aid when I'm giving the guy credit for something  that, look, it happened on his watch.  You gotta give him credit.  Al-Walaki, he had assassinated, who is an American citizen, and a lot of fucking liberals 
[00:57:00]  are so disgusted with the fact that he did that, and I'm so happy he did that, and he  supported fucking Libya, Qaddafi, good, and he didn't go into Syria, good.  I don't want him in Syria.  I don't either, but what's the difference between the Libya situation and the Syria situation?  Personally, I think that Libya, we had much more of a vested interest as a country in  going after that cocksucker for Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, and I think the fact that that 
[00:57:30]  scumbag publicly welcomed back that guy as a hero was a certain humiliating thing for  the United States, and just on principle, I'm glad that we in some way aided his murder.  Yeah, I'm kind of glad with that one, too.  But you know what?  Fucking Assad in Syria, as much as he's a piece of shit, I'm sure he funds terrorism secretly,  I don't have as much of an issue with him, and I don't really care what happens there.  Yeah, okay.  There you go. 
[00:58:00]  We should take our first break.  Who speaks tonight there?  Clinton?  Yeah.  They're calling him Elvis.  Elvis is going to be in the building tonight.  Clinton's up there.  Where is the Democratic Convention?  I should probably know.  Charlotte.  Charlotte, North Carolina.  And what are they, setting up the outdoor fucking stadium for Obama on Thursday?  I saw an aerial view.  Really?  I have a huge stage down there.  Oh, boy.  I think they're taking him outside again.  Rah, rah.  Did he do it last year outside?  He did, right?  The nomination outside, or was that after the DNC? 
[00:58:30]  The last time around.  I don't remember.  Remember the big outdoor thing, and Oprah's calling?  The columns and stuff.  Yeah, and Oprah's calling.  Yeah, that was at the convention.  That was a convention.  Yeah, that was four years ago.  Oh, so that was outside.  Yeah.  All right, so it looks like they're doing something similar this time around.  Trying to do that, huh?  Does anybody speak after the president?  No, no, no.  He's the last one.  I don't think so.  He's the show club.  Look at those hips.  Jesus.  That's a big dress.  It's not that bad, though.  No, no.  You can tell, though, it's hanging on.  She wears dresses like bells. 
[00:59:00]  That's right.  Yes.  Oh, and look at that mess.  Wow.  She's a big lady.  She's really big.  How tall is she, like 5'10"?  At least.  At least.  And Obama's just a skinny little dude.  That must look hilarious.  That's what I always think that, man.  She's 5'11".  How tall is he?  Was he 6'2", 6'3"?  He's probably bigger than we think.  Yeah, probably not.  I bet you he does a little heel thing.  6'1", okay.  He's 6'1"?  Yeah.  That's about right, I guess. 
[00:59:30]  And how tall is Romney?  These guys are all bigger than we think they're going to be.  Romney's 5'6".  Oh, I thought he was taller.  No, he's a little guy.  5'6".  A little twerp.  Fidget.  Have we ever had a short president?  Why can't we have a short president?  We can't have a fat president.  We can't have a short president.  Hmm.  You can have a black president.  We've learned that.  6'2".  You can have a Catholic president.  Who is the shortest president?  Oh, man.  The littlest president.  I bet it's way back.  You ought to do a show. 
[01:00:00]  The littlest president.  Van Buren or Taft.  Taft.  Wait, go backwards.  Bill Clinton was tall, right?  6'2"?  I'm sure he was at least 6'.  Wait, when I met him, let me think.  Yeah, he was a bit taller than me.  He was taller?  Yeah, he's tall.  I was showing that picture recently, and they're like,  Dude, you got your armor out of what's wrong with you.  Yeah.  I put my arm completely around the guy.  What?  It says James Madison was 5'4".  5'4", James Madison?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a little guy.  Oh, no, fella.  What can we help you with? 
[01:00:30]  You think he got tussled a lot?  Oh.  FDR was only 3'6".  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  And then Kennedy's height changed in mid-fucking-car ride.  Whoa.  Yeah.  By an inch or two?  Yeah.  I was 6'2", but now I'm 5'9".  Mid-car ride.  Wow.  He was 5'4".  What a little fella.  Who was the fattest president?  I guess Taft? 
[01:01:00]  That's got to be Taft, right?  I don't know.  None of those guys was like...  We had a few fat presidents.  Yeah, I think we did.  John Quincy Adams.  When did we say enough with the fat presidents?  Because it's been a long time now.  I'm guessing once TV became popular.  Oh, right.  Yeah, TV was big.  Yeah, it was Taft at between 300 and 350 pounds.  Damn.  Was he that fat?  Wow.  Let me see him.  Taft.  What years was he, Sam?  What's the top of your head?  He died in 1930.  So he was president from what? 
[01:01:30]  19...  1901 to 1905 or something?  No, I think it was later than that.  Do you know there was another presidential...  William Henry Nagel Taft.  There was a shooting at a president besides Kennedy and Lincoln.  In Buffalo.  Was it Buffalo?  Yeah, we broadcasted from the spot.  Who was it that...  Because it was the anniversary.  I forgot who it was.  Yeah.  It was Harrison.  Very good.  But there is video of it.  There's not video of it, really.  Yeah, there is.  There's video of...  Not video.  There's video of another presidential shooting. 
[01:02:00]  I understand what he meant by...  We just say video.  Where he gets hit?  No.  No, I don't know if you can see it or not.  Can you Google that?  Ford gets shot at.  No, not Ford.  Shot at it.  Twice.  Yeah.  By Squeaky and that other woman.  But no, no.  I mean...  This was...  No, this was in Buffalo.  From like 1901 or something like that.  It was some weird...  Huh.  Videotape.  Garfield.  Was it Garfield?  Garfield?  The cat from the comic.  I was just saying they were really funny.  He was never president, you cocksucker. 
[01:02:30]  Who got shot in Buffalo?  I forgot.  I don't know.  Harrison, right?  William Henry Harrison?  William Henry Harrison.  Yeah.  But is there a video of that?  Go to video, Sam.  I'll bite you.  I don't think there's a video of that.  Come on.  There should be...  Come on, Jimmy.  Um...  There is.  I've seen it.  You know how big that camera would have been?  Oh, man.  But you...  I can't see anything in it.  But it is listed as the video of...  Everything looked like Instagram back then. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  You can go for...  Yeah.  Okay.  Ah.  McKinley.  Is it McKinley?  The mob outside?  Maybe it was McKinley, right?  Might have been McKinley.  Go over here.  Oh, yeah.  It was McKinley.  Here we go.  This is...  Oh, this is immediately after President McKinley...  Well, what the hell?  Oh, it's immediately...  This is immediately after President McKinley was shot at.  Buffalo.  Wow.  Look at those wacky hats.  Oh, it's immediately after.  It's hot.  But I think that there is footage of the shooting.  Is there not?  That's amazing.  1901. 
[01:03:30]  You think all those people are dead, you think?  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, long.  Like, everyone loved hats.  Yes.  Everyone loved a good hat back then.  That must have been just annoying to carry a hat around all day.  With their hat.  That had to be a nice hat.  Yeah.  Yeah, they really were a hat.  We're a hat nation.  Oh, God.  Enough.  Was he shot at while he was taking the...  No, he was just doing a thing.  What was he doing?  Juggling?  Yeah, he was juggling, I think, in the street for some extra money. 
[01:04:00]  Damn.  Roosevelt was shot and gave a speech.  Teddy.  Teddy was, yeah.  I think so.  A lot of guys have been shot at.  That's a dangerous job, man.  Not anymore.  Man.  Even now, they're all behind glass.  They shut down half the city when Obama shows up.  The old days, it was like, all right, well, I don't know, let's put a rope up and...  Yes.  Now it's like...  Ah, here comes the...  It's our whistle stop.  The train's coming and he's going to be on the back of the train and give a speech.  From my building, when he went to ABC for, well, The View? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  There were snipers on top of a whole bunch of buildings.  Not taking any chances.  And then they shut down, like, I don't know, at least 10 blocks in each direction.  Yeah.  Who else has been assassinated?  It was Kennedy, Lincoln, and there was another president shot to death.  I believe.  I wish I knew this.  I think it was McKinley, right?  Yeah, he died.  Oh, he did die.  Yeah, absolutely, he died.  You're kidding. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, back then...  Leah.  Back then you got shot, you died.  Didn't McKinley die?  Well, they sawed your arm off.  Yeah, yeah, and Garfield, too.  Garfield, too.  No, there's three.  Who's the Garfield guy?  Four that died or no?  Assassinations, yeah.  Where did Garfield die?  Uh...  He was shot on July 2nd, 1881.  He died on September 19th of blood poisoning.  Ah, the blood poisoning.  Okay, so he was assassinated.  Yes.  Died of the lung fever. 
[01:05:30]  And what about McKinley?  McKinley, uh...  In Buffalo on September 6th.  Ooh, 1901.  That's tomorrow.  That's tomorrow.  1901.  So that's 111 years ago.  He was just, say he was shot and killed?  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shot two times by an anarchist.  By a shitty gun, too.  An anarchist.  Yeah.  Who was the...  You know, we're doing presidential facts.  Who was that asshole president that, um, died of the flu after his inaugural speech?  Oh, yeah.  He gave his speech in the rain and caught the fucking flu. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, man.  Dropped dead.  Died.  Was it Harrison?  Died 30 days into office.  30 days into office.  Because he gave his speech...  William Henry Harrison.  Because he gave his speech in the pouring rain.  So he's had five presidents die in office?  Maybe more.  Yeah.  Is it more?  I didn't realize there were four assassinated.  I didn't realize...  I thought it was three.  Hmm.  So after him, 19...  So you're 1891 and 1901.  That's a 10-year difference.  Then 1960...  No, we got Burr in there, too. 
[01:06:30]  Lincoln.  I'm sorry.  Lincoln, too.  Don't forget Burr.  Who?  Bill Burr's, uh, uh, uh, like, uh, great-great...  Oh.  Grandfather.  Aaron Burr.  He died in a fucking duel.  But...  But Aaron Burr wasn't the president, was he?  No.  The mean, Alexander Hamilton?  He was just the guy.  I wish we knew more.  But he was there with the...  Wait, what happened with the Burr guy, then?  Well, he was just the guy that shot...  Was he trying to be president?  No, he shot at, uh...  He shot...  Help me out with the Burr guy.  He was in a duel with the guy that became president.  Which was Jackson. 
[01:07:00]  Andrew Jackson?  Yeah.  Michael?  Eight people have died in office.  Wait, cool.  Eight people?  Yeah.  Zachary Taylor, president...  What happened to him?  Zachary Taylor.  He died of cholera after eating tainted cherries and milk in the middle of the summer.  What a dope...  Why would you do that?  Oh, the things that would kill you back then.  Uh, Warren G. Harding died of pneumonia in 1923.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Roosevelt...  Slipped on a...  He had a weird death.  He slipped on a cum and cracked his head. 
[01:07:30]  What did Roosevelt die?  Uh, cerebral hemorrhage.  Okay.  I'm 45.  And then it was JFK, Warren G. Harding.  Oh, Alexander Hamilton, but he, uh...  Yeah.  Uh...  So wait...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  With the duel?  Aaron Burr was vice president under Jefferson.  I knew he was, like, one of those guys.  I wasn't sure if he was running for office.  You had balls back then to run.  Because, wait, was Lincoln 65, 1865, I think?  Yeah.  And then 1891 and 19...  1881.  What?  Even closer.  It was 1865, 1881... 
[01:08:00]  1881 and then 1901.  Oh, no one.  And three presidents shot and killed in that period of time.  And no one thought, maybe we should get a little more security around these guys.  Yeah, I think they finally figured it out.  Holy fuck.  And then only one in 111 years.  In 100...  No, in 100 years, one, two, three, four, five...  Well, six died in office over the course of 100 years.  Well, they were also older back then as they got elected, too.  FDR died in office.  Did they?  Yeah.  Yep.  Cerebral hemorrhage.  When you say the...  I'm saying the assassinations. 
[01:08:30]  Oh.  Three...  1865...  Three assassinated in 20 fucking years.  Oh, no.  Or is that 40 years?  40 years.  I'm sorry.  Guys, getting this instant feedback.  I did not know this.  Ronald Reagan was shot at and there's footage.  Oh, I'd heard that, but I didn't believe it.  Who knew?  I didn't know there was footage.  Really?  I thought that was just a rumor he got shot at.  I think it is.  I think he's wrong.  So four have been shot in office.  Wait, Burr was never president?  No.  See, I don't know some of those oldie guys. 
[01:09:00]  Oldie guys.  I know the basics, but then I get confused by some of these.  I remember that commercial.  I would suck on...  Burr, yeah.  I would suck on Jeopardy! if it was a presidential category.  How many presidents have there been?  44?  49.  49.  So when they say the 44th president, right, they don't count.  Like, you know, you aren't the 44th and 45th president if you did two times.  You're the 44th.  Right.  So there's 44 presidents, right? 
[01:09:30]  Obama's 44?  Because at least 10% of the presidents, I think, have been...  But how...  We lived in...  There was actually a time in this country where you just dueled.  You were huge political figures, and you guys...  And they would just duel each other?  We're going to duel!  I could see if it's two just fucking assholes in what is now, I don't know, Newark, New Jersey,  but actual huge political figures are like, all right, we gotta fucking have a duel.  A lot of the dueling was to save face. 
[01:10:00]  And because if somebody dissed you, you'd have to save face.  And sometimes it did come down to pistol duel.  But a lot of the times, both of them knew that they could get out of it and save face  by participating in the duel, but missing.  So a lot of duels...  And it was very hard to hit anybody anyway with those dueling pistols.  But they would totally just aim away from the people.  I would so aim.  Because they didn't want to kill them.  They didn't want to kill them.  They didn't want to be killed.  So they'd be like, all right, we saved face. 
[01:10:30]  But I'm not taking the chance that the other guy's going to do the right thing.  Exactly.  So I'm aiming.  I'm sorry.  You never know.  And how many steps?  Ten?  I don't know what the paces really were.  Everybody says ten.  I'm going to cheat on the pacing, too.  I ain't taking no fucking chance.  Yeah, huh?  Fuck yeah.  I like the way Bugs Bunny did it.  They got back to back, and then they counted off the paces with Yosemite Sam.  But Bugs walked backwards.  So when Yosemite Sam turned around and pointed his guns, he was like almost hugging Bugs Bunny.  And Bugs kissed him.  Hilarious. 
[01:11:00]  They said Harrison gave a three-hour inauguration speech in a winter storm and then died of pneumonia.  A fucking three-hour speech?  What a dick.  Enough already.  How many other people died from...  Yeah.  Yeah, who died in the audience?  Yeah, I bet you he wasn't the only one.  Harry Seward from Manhattan says, if you gave Obama any credit for his success, your word would mean something.  Number one, he saved the auto industry.  Oh, did he?  Romney would have done opposite.  Number two, he inherited getting Osama. 
[01:11:30]  Fuck you.  Three, gave tax cuts to middle class.  Why would you say fuck you isn't an explanation to he inherited getting Osama bin Laden.  He inherited a lot of the intelligence that was in place.  All of the people that were finding the courier and looking for him, you know, where do you think that came from?  You think Obama got that first day in office? 
[01:12:00]  Hey, no one's looking for this guy.  No!  They started looking for him when Obama went into office?  Yeah, that must have been what happened.  Because that guy said, fuck you.  That's his explanation.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Shut up.  If you're going to say you inherited the bad economy, then you inherited everything that was started before you got in office.  And the hunt for bin Laden was started well before he got into office.  So, fuck you.  And number three, gave tax cuts to middle class, left all other taxes alone. 
[01:12:30]  Who did that?  Obama.  Yeah, much to his chagrin.  Obama's done some good things.  He's wanted to fucking raise those taxes for quite a while on people that are making $250,000 and more.  And believe me, that number goes down.  And if you really look at it, everybody's going to take a hit on taxes if Obama gets his way.  That's the truth as I speak it.  And I'm being called a douche because Burr killed Hamilton, you douche.  Oh. 
[01:13:00]  Burr shot Hamilton.  And Hamilton died.  Yeah.  I don't think he died right away, did he?  Huh.  No.  No.  Huh.  A duel.  Oh, big lead ball just hitting you like that.  Ah!  Just cracking every bone.  Oh, yeah.  And Hamilton was the money guy.  I did know that.  He created our finance system.  All right, Hamilton!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  All right, enough politics.  Let's get into some stupid shit after the break. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, I gotta eat.  That's the beauty of this show, right?  Stupid shit next.  The Opie and Anthony show presents Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm going, this motherfucker, Fran Suckdick, I call her.  I want to take pictures with just all the guy comics.  You know, she's like jumping in there.  I'm going, no, just the guys, right?  I just want the guys.  And then I'm calling her over.  And this classless piece of fucking shit that talks like a fucking truck driver is giving me the fingers. 
[01:14:00]  I'm going, number one, I don't like girl comics.  I like girl comics that are fucking funny.  I can't help that this motherfucker is talentless, okay?  That is not my problem.  I just hate the ones that fucking stink at what they fucking do.  And she's fucking awful.  And I think she's a scumbag for fucking with me.  How about you stay home and actually raise the fucking baby you have rather than trying out for a fucking Tampax commercial, you dumb fuck.  I'm telling you, honestly, I know her. 
[01:14:30]  She's joking.  That's not real.  Oh, then my mistake.  This has been Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  And now a reading from the book of Ted.  When the wine was gone, Ted had his disciples fill the jugs with water.  And then a miracle occurred.  And Ted said,  I took water and I turned it into crystal light. 
[01:15:00]  The wine was now crystal light.  When the food was gone, Ted's disciples gathered.  And the Lord Ted proclaimed,  I took a bunch of fishes and turned them into more fishes by cutting them in half.  I had 30 fishes and I should like present E.E. with 60 half-fishes.  It was the second miracle Ted had performed.  And Ted then divided the fish among them.  I've worked miracles.  The king was not impressed and ordered Ted to be arrested.  Oh, no!  They misunderstood me!  Ted shouted as he tried to explain himself. 
[01:15:30]  I had an erection.  It was tending out of my robe beautifully.  But the guards just ignored him.  And Ted was taken away.  The Lord Ted was to be crucified.  Ow!  My hands and feet are hurting.  Ted shouted as the nails were driven into his flesh.  As the crowd looked on, Ted looked to the people and announced,  I have it, I have it not.  You go and spore it.  Whatever that means, this has been a reading from the book of Ted.  Sirius XM. 
[01:16:00]  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  We didn't even talk about everyone's time off.  I do want to say something really quickly.  I went to the Made in America concert in Philadelphia.  They set up a stage right below the steps that you run up to the top there like Rocky did.  Ah, the Rocky stairs.  And I finally saw a fucking Pearl Jam, Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Ah!  And I am telling you right the fuck now, as much as you make fun of Pearl Jam,  you would have enjoyed yourself.  I like the Pearl Jam.  Huh?  I like the Pearl Jam.  I goof around with the Pearl Jam.  They're an amazing type band.  Eddie Vedder is ridiculously good.  His voice is completely the same from when he started.  And he doesn't sound like that in concert with every song.  I was blown away.  I took my brother-in-law and he looked at me.  He's been to a lot of shows.  He's like, this is the best concert I've ever been to. 
[01:17:00]  He's a bit.  He's a lot younger than me, but still.  And I'm telling you, I'm putting this concert right up there with any other show I've ever seen.  Damn.  Any other show I've ever seen.  And he didn't disappoint.  Pearl Jam comes out and they just get right to it.  Yeah.  Did he ramble?  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little rambling?  He didn't want to mention the Republicans by name.  Oh, boy.  What a surprise.  Wow.  What a maverick.  And he's very mad that the Republicans are preventing the less fortunate from voting. 
[01:17:30]  No, they're not.  That's that one, too.  Why do these assholes talk?  They're not preventing anyone from voting, you dummy.  You know what?  Besides that, though, he didn't really talk about politics.  What a guy.  Good.  You know, but the band was fucking great.  It's tight as all hell.  But then again, they've been playing these songs off and off for like 20 years now, right?  Most of them. 
[01:18:00]  Is that Jay-Z?  And then Jay-Z came out and he did 99 Problems with Pearl Jam.  And Sam is shaking his head because he knows what happened.  Look, man, there were 60,000 to 70,000 people there.  I decided after Alive that I'm going to beat all these fuckers to the subway.  You left early?  You didn't even have work the next day.  I missed two songs.  It was the song.  This is the only one anybody's talking about.  I figured after Alive he was going to do something, but I figured it would be a letdown after Alive, so I left. 
[01:18:30]  How could you not think Jay-Z?  It was his show.  It was Jay-Z's festival.  Jay-Z put on the Made in America.  You missed this?  But the big chain won't, yeah.  Well, I never missed shows early.  It's like, hey, traffic, hey, traffic.  No, man.  It was, I don't know how many people.  It was at least 60,000, and they were all going right back to the fucking trains.  But you don't even have work.  You didn't have work the next day.  Yeah, but I didn't want to spend two hours.  It would have been worth it.  I figured I'd sacrifice two songs.  I'd get out nice.  I grabbed a cab and went back to the in-laws' house. 
[01:19:00]  I still get over that shit when I'm not in traffic.  I'm like, yeah, motherfucker.  You're with me, right?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Especially if you get a little older, Sam.  Man.  Yeah, but this is like...  You know what?  That's what YouTube is for.  Look.  There you go.  I'm watching it.  Yeah!  And it was a shitty version.  This is the moment everybody's talking about.  Jay-Z performed 99 Problems with Pearl Jam.  And Pearl Jam just had to sit there and try to come up with some kind of riff for Jay-Z.  Yeah, go off.  Yeah, I saw all the videos now. 
[01:19:30]  I missed that.  So did I, and I didn't have to go.  There you go.  I saw everything else.  I heard Yellow Leadbetter, an elderly woman behind the counter in a small town.  He did them all.  Better man.  That's something you don't hear every day.  What?  It's every Pearl Jam concert, though.  This is what made this concert different.  I'm sure it'll be on the Pearl Jam channel.  I'll be good.  You know what?  Who cares?  I didn't have to wait two fucking hours.  And I was standing for eight straight hours.  And you weren't even leaving Philly.  Because I had shitty tickets.  Because my ticket connection is slacking a little bit.  Wait, you had bad tickets? 
[01:20:00]  You couldn't get you good tickets?  I have a really good, solid...  It's the Yankee person.  Well, then you say those were great tickets.  You would be appreciative.  Nice.  I got my tickets and went, general fucking admission?  Oh, boy.  Wasn't it outdoor, like...  What?  Wasn't general admission everything?  General admission show.  You can't get...  You know what?  Ron Howard had some solid tickets.  He probably was like, excuse me, excuse me.  He worked his way up.  Look, I'm an Opie. 
[01:20:30]  He's an Opie.  Why not get the same...  We're both Opsters.  Yeah, but not the same.  Why does one Opster get special treatment?  You're mad at the Yankees lady because you didn't have Ron Howard tickets.  Well, yeah.  Wait, did he...  Where was Ron Howard?  Was there a VIP section or no?  Some of these is Stanley Romali.  Well, let's just put it this way.  My Instagram shots of the Pearl Jam show were a little different than Ron Howard's.  You could pretty much see the nose hairs, a genetic vetter's fucking nose. 
[01:21:00]  I want the Ted Danson plane.  Jay-Z was probably in his pictures.  It was 80,000 people.  Oh, good.  I beat 80,000 people and there was one way out.  No, they beat you because they got to see the concert.  Yeah, good for them, man.  They win.  I never leave early.  Unless I don't like the band or something, then I would, but I would never leave a show.  I was trying to guess what I was going to miss.  And when I heard it live, I'm like, okay, he's got one or two left.  What could it possibly be?  And 99 Problems is the only Jay-Z song you actually like. 
[01:21:30]  No, there's a few Jay-Z songs I like now, but 99 Problems is a fucking great song.  How does that go?  Can you play a little bit of that?  I love 99 Problems.  You're going to play this version?  No.  Honestly, that's really...  I mean, people are praising this shit and Rolling Stone is talking about this.  It's a shitty version of 99 Problems that Jay-Z did with Pearl Jam.  Rolling Stone desperately just wants to not be fucking uptight white people.  Listen for yourself.  Answer to your question, Opie.  Yeah, what?  Why Opie Opster got a better ticket than Opster. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Because he made Apollo 13.  You put baby shit on your lip.  There you go.  There you go.  You're absolutely right.  If you have a GoPro, that's Becky's up.  I got it.  I got it.  Well, the beauty of this is Pearl Jam has no idea what they should be doing for Jay-Z. 
[01:22:30]  This is kind of silly at the end of a Pearl Jam show, though.  It's kind of a letdown.  If Sabbath brought him out, I would laugh at them.  What do you mean, why is it shitty?  Yeah, but if they were playing his show, it's his festival.  They never brought anybody out, though.  I don't know.  Oh, by the way, the other Opster got better tickets because he's also filming a documentary 
[01:23:00]  on the whole thing.  Oh.  Oh, well, that could be it.  And you're yelling at the lady who gave you free tickets.  You want those fucking Ron Howard tickets.  Made in America, bitch.  Let me hear some...  E-Rock, you have some 99 Problems?  Yeah, this is...  If you having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son.  I got 99 Problems.  But a bitch ain't one.  I got the Rat Patrol on the Cat Patrol.  Foes that want to make sure my cask is closed.  Rat critics say he's money, cash hoes.  I'm from the hood, stupid.  What type of facts are those?  If you grew up with hoes in your head and toes, you celebrate the mix. 
[01:23:30]  What's happened, though?  I'm like, fuck critics.  You can kiss my whole asshole.  If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.  I got beef with radio, if I don't play they show, they don't play my hits.  Well, I don't give a shit, so...  This is good.  Awesome.  White people love this song.  I love this song.  I play this song on K-Rock.  Oh, yeah, because what's his name there?  Produced the album.  Rick Rubin.  He produced the song, not the album.  Oh, just this song?  Did Rick Rubin produce this? 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah, he did.  He's a monster.  What I've heard, though, it's funny.  When I asked my pal, well, one of my pals, Tony Gieser and Oz,  and Rick Rubin is doing their album,  they joke that he's just never there.  Like, I've heard Rick Rubin just doesn't show up.  Like, he just lets you do what you want to do,  and he'll come in and listen.  Slap his name on it.  Yeah, but he comes in and goes,  I like that, I don't like that.  What a great gig.  Yeah.  Let's start doing that.  I like it a lot, actually.  Just not show up, but get all the credit.  Well, sometimes producers don't. 
[01:24:30]  Opie, that's like going to Hawaii and not seeing stuff.  Oh, God.  I didn't see where you were going.  I actually, I wasn't going there until we,  we said we should do that, and I just thought of it.  Oh, that's funny.  Someone's saying it's like going to Hawaii and not seeing stuff,  because they didn't stick around for Jay-Z?  No, it's like, wow.  It was over a two-hour concert, and I saw two hours.  They went probably two hours and seven minutes.  Yeah, but you come back and...  And I've heard Keep On Rockin' in the Free World a million times, 
[01:25:00]  and it's great how they do it and all that.  The only question, the first question people are asking you is,  oh, so you saw, and you go, no, I didn't see that part.  Well, I'd tell everyone else they did.  Oh, you didn't?  Yeah, that's fucking awesome.  Yeah, I told everyone I saw Jay-Z.  Because you saw it on YouTube.  I even said it on Twitter.  Fuck, Jay-Z with Pearl Jam.  That was amazing.  But then I figured the truth would be much better radio here today.  Oh, why would you lie to the Twitter people?  Because they're assholes.  We all know that.  No, you should have stayed.  Especially if you don't have work the next day. 
[01:25:30]  I could understand if you had to get up early or something.  And you were staying in Philly.  Yeah.  So there's no excuse.  Especially if you had a train.  You could take a train.  Like, a train's usually not that bad.  Couldn't you have walked or was it way out of your...  Anthony's on my side.  I'm good.  But Anthony's thinking of driving out of the Meadowlands.  I missed seven minutes.  Who cares?  That was these seven minutes.  You were at the Rocky statue.  Couldn't you have walked from there?  No, it was one way out.  It was a pain in the...  What?  Walk where?  Home?  How far is the Rocky statue from where they live?  I don't know. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, half hour?  First of all, walk out gets me too.  Like, to have to walk with all those people to walk out.  I don't understand this.  If everybody's moving toward the exit and walking,  why can't we just immediately start walking at the speed that everybody walks?  Yeah.  Just move!  That's a very good question.  I don't get it.  Why is it this...  You gotta do the shuffle behind people.  Shkunk.  Shkunk.  Shkunk.  Shkunk.  I left at 11.  I bet you it took an hour just to exit the festival. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, that was...  I would bet.  If you're in the back there a little bit, it's an hour.  Because it was one way out.  It's part of the experience.  Fuck that.  You get to see a moment.  I see it now on YouTube.  A moment just fucking start it up and drive out of there.  Get the fuck out.  But the point being, I'm pathetic for not seeing Pearl Jam sooner than I did.  They're an amazing fucking band.  And I've been hooked on them for a long time.  But now I gotta go to like a shitload of shows.  I think you would love it too, man. 
[01:27:00]  I really do.  I know I would.  Yeah.  I like the Pearl Jam.  I'm not like a huge fucking Travis type fan.  And then you forget how many hits they have too.  They have so many sing-along songs.  99 Problems.  99 Problems.  No, man.  Not 99 Problems.  99 Problems, but Opie ain't here.  The Opster was tired and he had to get in the cab.  I got the first cab out of there.  Because then the cab traffic.  Oh, that would have been crazy.  Yeah, but that makes you like a square. 
[01:27:30]  That's not cool.  A square.  I'm not a square because I went into the rave tent.  Yes, you're definitely a square.  You went to the rave tent?  Oh, man.  If you want to feel old, I know old.  But if you want to really feel old, go into a rave tent.  But that shit is...  Oh, I thought you said the rape tent.  Sounds great.  That shit is fucking good, though, man.  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever gone into a rave tent?  No.  And just felt the energy?  No, you didn't chip.  I did.  No, never.  You did?  Yeah, I was just raving like a motherfucker.  No.  You were not. 
[01:28:00]  What's a rave tent?  I thought those were like done in 1999.  Oh, shit.  Hey, man.  Rave tent.  I was checking out Afro Jack.  Okay.  Yeah.  Afro Jack has a remix with somebody with that song that was a big hit this summer.  That's the most nondescript sentence anybody's ever known.  That's an E-Rock vagueness right there.  Now you're just someone that I used to know.  Right.  That's G-T-A.  G-T-A, right.  Yeah.  G-T-A.  Afro Jack did a fucking remix. 
[01:28:30]  Was it good?  It was amazing.  So what goes on in the rave tent?  A lot of good reviews.  A lot of good reviews.  A lot.  A lot.  Take us out.  No.  No.  Rave tent.  A lot of dry humping.  A lot of dry humping.  Did you get a rod?  All you have to do is walk through the middle of the crowd and you're fucking dry humping.  Wow.  A lot of ecstasy, right?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone is just rubbing.  A lot of rubbing going on in the rave tent.  I don't know.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Give me that Afro Jack remix. 
[01:29:00]  Please.  Damn.  So were you, uh, was this hotness in there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Me and my brother-in-law were being creepers.  Shits.  We were being big time creepers.  Oh, Scott.  They were, you should have waited.  Got some pictures?  Well, we were trying, but then you look like a creep.  Yeah.  Well, you are.  Yeah.  No, I understand, but they're fully aware.  Yeah.  The girls, they walk around like they're pretty much naked, but God forbid you lift your camera.  Oh, man.  Then they look at you like, really? 
[01:29:30]  I'm like, yeah, really.  You're naked.  That's bullshit.  Just to go back for a second, this is what Opie wrote on Twitter.  I already said I lied on Twitter.  Oh, but you lied even more.  Oh, you wrote hashtag Pearl Jam Day.  Wake up.  You're missing.  Jay-Z performed 99 problems with Pearl Jam because some people were sleeping.  Well, look at this picture.  Oh, man.  Which is just lies on top of the line because Opie was missing it.  Best comment on that picture was, uh, it looks like Anthony was here.  Oh, God. 
[01:30:00]  I will not describe the picture any further.  Well, there you go.  That's some fat asses.  And Run DMC, I saw.  Oh, you saw Run?  Well, they're, uh, reuniting.  I think that was the first time they reunited since the, you know, the J Master thing.  J Master J, I think so.  And, uh, I, it was very obvious that Run was, um, very tired after the first song.  Oh, really?  Was sweating like crazy.  Oh, boy.  And I think after about seven minutes, next thing you know, there's a long interlude. 
[01:30:30]  So, I think he could go backstage and suck on some oxygen.  Oh, he had a little bit of, uh, a stamina problem?  But, with that said, they, uh, sounded really good.  What's that?  Is that part of the rave tent there?  Yeah, that's the rave tent.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  No filter on my Instagram.  A lot of backwards fucking volcaps and, uh...  Tank tops.  Tank tops, yeah.  And it's just a DJ in the front.  Like, what does he actually do, Sam?  Who, Troy Kwan?  Uh, that's Troy Kwan shit. 
[01:31:00]  I understand that, but what do they actually do?  I mean, they just...  I mean...  I don't think they do anything.  Well, yeah, why do they have to stand there and look at him like a band?  They could theoretically just mix it ahead of time, but I think the...  I think they do mix it ahead of time, and then they, they, you know, they're in front there,  making, believe they're doing it on the spot.  I think the idea is that they're supposed to be mixing it, uh, and just kind of feeling  the crowd, and so when the crowd starts to lull, they put on, you know, they mix in something  else and just go, make them go fucking nuts for as long as possible. 
[01:31:30]  We fucked up the J Master J thing.  It's Jam Master J.  That's what I said, Jam Master J.  Yeah, why?  Jam Master J.  What did you say?  People saying you said, uh, J Master J.  No, you said that.  Because I said J Master, and you said J Master J.  I said Jam Master J because I heard you say J Master J.  Jam Master J.  I fucked that one up.  I know what his name is.  Yes.  That's why the song is called Jam Master Jamin'.  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Come on, Sammy.  Oh, you got him.  Oh, you got him.  That, uh, that just looks, ugh. 
[01:32:00]  Hang on.  It's fucking sweaty.  And I see, all I've seen is a lot of guys, a lot of young men.  Well, when I was walking through, yeah, I guess that's unfortunately the angle I had.  Yeah, because there were a lot of, there were a lot of girls there.  Hmm.  Did you do drugs?  I swear, guys, I swear.  You take pills?  Just take some of those pills?  I drank Budweiser.  I fucking hate Budweiser.  You didn't do any pills while you were in the rave tent?  No, I did not.  You gotta do pills.  No.  But I was smelling pot, and I was taking in deep breaths. 
[01:32:30]  Ooh, hoping that maybe I did a slight contact buzz.  You are a square.  A square.  What's this?  Is this the Afrojack song?  No, that's not in the systems anyway.  This is just, uh, Troy Rave music.  Troy?  Oh.  This is alright.  I don't mind this.  I do.  Can you still play this, though?  This is like, this is old?  It sounds kind of old to me.  Here it goes. 
[01:33:00]  Building, building.  And two, three, four.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Oh, my God.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  I like this, though.  I like this kind of stuff.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you really like this?  Not, I don't love this song, but I like that kind of a beat.  Sam, find the Afrojack remix.  Find it, Sam.  I saw it on YouTube.  Looking up your favorite stuff online.  You bikini girls.  The point being that Pearl Jam was amazing.  Yeah.  Fucking amazing.  Right up there with any show I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:33:30]  Nice.  Fucking loved it.  And I told you I saw STP in Huntington, too.  STP!  And I'm here to say that Scott Weiland, I don't know how he did it, but he's got his shit back  together.  Oh, good.  That band sounded amazing, too.  Good stuff.  Real good stuff.  He gained a few pounds.  He doesn't look like a scarecrow anymore.  He's still extremely thin, but not like we saw him the last time.  He's a little feller.  The band was way better, way tighter, and at the end, they all kind of like arms around 
[01:34:00]  each other, bowed in the crowd, showing that they're one unit again, because they've  had their problems over the years.  But then, of course, I had the VIP treatment at that show, and of course, the owner of the  Paramount in Huntington, you've got to check out that place, by the way.  Oh, hell yeah.  They're asking for you, and they're asking for you, too.  It would be a great place to do a comedy show.  It's probably too big for me.  If STP is doing it, I can't tell.  Oh, 1,800.  1,800.  That's doable, but not by myself.  Well, we can figure something out, because they want to work with us.  So the owner takes me back to CSTP, and I go, please, don't fucking say my name, because 
[01:34:30]  of all the trash talk we've done over the years.  I go, just say I'm some idiot.  Some idiot.  But we didn't even get past the door, because of course they're not meeting anybody.  Of course not.  Really?  And they even turned the owner away.  The owner of the Paramount.  God, they're such douchebags.  Why are they such douchebags?  They really are hateable.  Because they didn't know who was coming in.  They don't even know who we are, to be honest with you, but if they did, we were just schmucks 
[01:35:00]  wanting to say hi, that the owner was bringing back.  Jesus.  So that hasn't changed, but their sound is way better.  They sounded really, really good.  Is this the remix?  There's a bunch of different ones, so I don't know if this will be it or not.  Who's this mixed with?  Like when you said you felt so happy you could die. 
[01:35:30]  That's one of the big hits of the song.  I told myself that you were right for me, but felt so lonely in your company, but that  would love it to make us stay alive. 
[01:36:00]  This one's just wackiness.  This is probably great if you're high.  Yeah.  If you sold it.  I fucking hate this. 
[01:36:30]  There we go.  Now we're raving.  Jimmy's into it.  Yeah, this is good.  Big beat, big beat, coming up.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  We're talking buttery beats here, so.  Buttery beats.  There we go.  Oh, yeah.  I got fucking glow sticks on my ass.  I just put eight of them up my ass.  Do you hate this hand?  It's great.  I fucking hate this.  Oh, you do?  There's nothing I like about this.  But you feel the energy in the rave tank.  I could give it a shot.  And you just go with it.  No.  No, I'm not going with it.  I don't like this one as much. 
[01:37:30]  I don't even know if this is the version that Afrojack played.  I have no idea.  That song was a monster this summer, though.  He sounds like Sting, right?  Yeah.  Now, is this song meant to be, or is Afrojack mixing two things?  Oh, you want to hear the original?  Just to.  Yeah.  This was probably the song of the summer.  Oh.  It sounds like the police. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, this is good.  Some synchronicity.  This guy has very good cheese, too.  Oh, boy.  OTA.  You think Sting is pissed off?  This is very.  He's just doing his tantric sex.  But even that.  Right there.  For ten fucking years without coming.  But even that little.  That's all the police right there. 
[01:38:30]  Very police sounding different.  I like this.  This was a huge song of the summer.  Not this part, but I like this song.  It was no Call Me Maybe, but it was up there.  Yeah, it was.  Call Me Maybe is the song of the summer.  As introduced to the world after opening Anthony Lyons.  Oh, that's right.  How about that?  As did everybody else. 
[01:39:00]  You don't have to play the whole thing.  Iraq, are you still in charge of the interns?  Oh, no.  What?  I'm just asking.  People want to know.  There was a whole thing on the show yesterday that he quit.  He quit, so he's not, I guess.  I'm going to recap for everybody.  Iraq said no.  So there's really no reason to even delve into this.  Iraq said he quit.  It's kind of repetitive at this point.  And he was really definite and very adamant about it yesterday.  So I would say he's not. 
[01:39:30]  He's just not in charge of interns anymore.  He gave up.  He's not in charge.  He quit.  He gave up on them.  And he absolutely quit yesterday, officially.  Good for him.  Iraq?  Iraq.  Where are we at with the interns?  Yeah, I'm still in charge.  Why?  Why?  And then he goes home and wonders why.  Like, you do it to yourself.  Why are you still in charge?  Because there's nobody else around here that's allowed to be in charge of the interns.  Allowed?  What do you mean allowed?  But that's not your problem. 
[01:40:00]  How do you fit a certain criteria that no one else does?  Then I don't do it.  We have no interns.  And then nobody gets your coffee on time.  That's not your problem, though.  It's the radio wizard's problem to figure it out.  So what happened?  You went to them yesterday.  And what did you say?  I spoke with Gary.  What did you say?  No, I'm not going into that.  Why?  Come on the radio.  Oh, of course you go into it.  Talk about sex?  What?  The sex man's in CEO mode.  First of all, his name's not Gary.  It's the radio wizard.  The radio wizard talked to you after the show?  Yeah, I spoke to him.  And he talked you back into being in charge of the interns? 
[01:40:30]  Scared him.  You do realize you get no extra money to do that.  What did he say to you?  But then we don't have interns.  So be it.  Wait, what did he say to you?  He said, I do a good job with this.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Praise him first.  Lied.  Praise him first.  Yes.  I don't know why this is so great.  This is corporate bullshit that so many people have to deal with.  But go ahead, Iraq.  Sorry.  I do a good job with it.  The program's been doing well for the year that we've had them back.  No incidents.  And it's pretty much that there's nobody else that could be in charge of the interns at 
[01:41:00]  this point.  So he asked me to please continue doing so.  Wow, did he fucking bamboozle you.  Yeah, he really fucking...  Oh, you do a great job.  No, did you.  Yes.  Oh, Iraq.  You're good.  Someone said to Iraq, you're good.  He's like, Iraq, you're doing it, boss.  It works well on the weak-minded.  So are you happy that you're back as the boss of the interns?  Sure. 
[01:41:30]  Did they say you're not the boss of me?  I would say that.  Did you ask for more money?  Did you mention that?  We'll talk in February.  Oh.  February.  What's February?  February of...  That's a no, by the way.  We'll talk in February?  We'll talk in February.  You do know that's a big no.  You're talking now.  They're just banking on that whole Mayan end of the world thing.  That's what they're doing.  Fuck you.  Holy fuck.  Why February?  What's February?  That's when they do all the corporate reviews of everyone that works there. 
[01:42:00]  But you've been doing it a year.  Yeah.  But...  They have you look forward to things that...  They never come.  ...that never will happen.  Because now, from now until February, you're like, oh, February's fine.  They're going to do the right thing.  And then some excuse happens in February.  So what is it exactly that you do here?  That's the review.  Right.  Sitting down with the guys from the fucking office space.  Tell me what it is you do here.  Wow. 
[01:42:30]  Iraq, February.  I really thought this time that you would have, like, said, fuck them.  Well, I can't just...  You know, I have to deal with them after this show.  What are the interns doing today?  Right now, one's marking drops, and the other...  Where did the other one go?  Wow.  Don't say he's answering the phones.  He's not.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  So he's answering the phones.  He's on the phone.  All right, cool.  Tell him to bang his new tattoo.  Iraq, let me...  We don't have to spend an hour on this, but I do want to say something really quick to  you, Iraq. 
[01:43:00]  If you said, no, I really don't want to be the boss of the interns, then me and Ant and  Jimmy would obviously go to Steve Blatter and go, look, we need interns.  And then the radio wizard would have to figure it out.  Yeah.  He would have to figure it out.  You don't know how to play hardball.  Right.  No.  It seems it's more that you have a problem with me in charge of the interns, meaning  all three of you, not just him.  Whoa!  Hey, hey.  We hear it in your voice you don't want to be in charge. 
[01:43:30]  Okay, but...  He also said he didn't want to be in charge.  Yeah, yeah.  See, he's...  He also quit twice.  You're full of turkey.  Yeah, you asked him, do you want to do this?  And he said no.  Yeah, so that's what we're basing, what we're saying on.  I don't give a fuck what happens in the end.  But don't do the right thing by the show by keeping the intern program around to help  us out.  Oh, shit.  It will stay around, but if you don't want to do it, then like I said, and I'll say  it again, the radio wizard, that's his job.  He'll have to figure out how this is going to work.  But instead, he talked you into doing something you don't want to do. 
[01:44:00]  Yes, he did, dumb bellow.  That's all I'm saying.  Do you think he likes being the boss and he won't admit it?  Yes, he loves it.  He literally does.  He's fucking Billy Boss.  Maybe.  He loves it.  That's my theory from the beginning.  Who was the new intern eyeballing me today?  Yesterday, he won't look at you.  Yeah, because they didn't admit to getting out of your line of sight yesterday.  How about the fucking one today, the guy that looks like that guy from SNL?  Tall guy or short guy?  The guy with the glasses. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, it's you.  Okay.  You know what his name is?  What?  Anthony.  Oh, boy, great.  Yay.  So just say, you could distinguish us by saying like, the talented Anthony.  And the one on the radio.  Yes.  Who does he look like?  Who's that guy from SNL?  Fred Armisen?  Yes.  It's Fred Armisen.  He looks like Fred Armisen.  How come he was eyeballing Anthony?  I don't know. 
[01:45:00]  Why were you eyeballing the boss?  He actually spoke to me.  What did he say?  He just kept looking at me, so I felt compelled to have to go, how are you doing?  You don't want to deal with that first time.  Oh, man.  I just walked in the fucking door.  I'm like, I got to talk to an intern.  Oh, fudge.  A lowly intern.  Exactly.  I'm going to chat with him.  I'm going to fucking chit chat.  Hi.  Hey, how are you doing?  I'm like, ugh.  I just walked up.  You got to get in the zone.  You got to show to do.  Right.  That's right.  You got to get in your mental space.  Intern.  And it's not like, because believe me, he was staring from the second I walked in the 
[01:45:30]  door.  So I'm looking, oh, this got to be a new intern.  So then I was pressured into going like, how are you doing?  Give him the head nod.  How are you doing?  You got to tell the interns not to stare at the talent.  You do realize it's either an intern or a love child, right?  Oh, no.  That's the only choices.  Could be.  Could possibly be.  So E-Rock's still the boss?  No, no, no.  Oh, yeah, he is.  So you're going to be happy with this position, E-Rock?  I'll make the best of it.  He's bullshitting.  He's happy with it. 
[01:46:00]  He loves it.  He does.  He loves being the boss.  He sacrifices his own well-being for others.  He's not.  He doesn't, though.  You're obviously voting for Obama.  He's a martyr.  You're an Obama guy.  He likes doing it.  He likes having the guys look up to it.  He wants to be a martyr.  But he's the intern boss because he likes being the boss of something.  This is what he has.  Yeah.  Like, he's not, you know what I mean?  Like, he can at least try to command respect from the interns.  Yeah.  It makes sense.  I would, you know, if I was.  Sorry, I'll destroy everything and not give a shit like everyone else around here. 
[01:46:30]  Oh!  Is that what I should be doing?  Thank God for E-Rock.  Is that what I should be doing?  He cares.  E-Rock is saving the show.  I'm not saving anything.  You can say that again.  E-Rock, this is all based on you not being.  This is all based on you have some kind of.  This is annoying you more than it's annoying me at this point now.  And I don't understand why this kid is fucking crazy.  Because he doesn't know.  I think he's a guy.  Because he doesn't know how to argue his points.  He's crazy so much, too.  This is all based on the fact you aren't happy with the position.  If you had, in the beginning, if you had been, if you just said, I like being the intern 
[01:47:00]  boss, then it would have been like, oh.  Yeah.  Cool.  That's why you're the intern boss.  Yeah.  But you won't admit that you like it.  And so then they're like, well, why are you doing it?  And then everything goes in circles.  And that's why it makes for good radio.  Because you made it obvious you don't want to be in that position.  So then we begged you to quit.  And then you finally quit.  And then it turns out you never quit.  That's why this is good.  So I don't even know what's real anymore with you.  No.  Does he like the job?  Does he not like the job? 
[01:47:30]  Does he just want to be a martyr?  What's up?  He likes the job, but he also wants to be a martyr.  And if he likes the job, he can't be a martyr because he would just have the job because  he likes it.  Do you want to be a superhero, Iraq?  Iraq?  Superhero?  Comment?  He kept the job because Gary told him, remember, with great power comes great responsibility.  Oh, man.  That's a good line.  What superhero would you be?  Oh, boy.  In a fantasy world.  Oh, God. 
[01:48:00]  What kind of superhero?  Did we do this already?  I don't know if we did.  Bogey boy.  What superhero would you be?  I don't think I'd be a hero.  I'd be a villain.  Oh.  And he'd be from the city of Competent.  So people could say he lived incompetent.  Why did Sam just slap his face with bullpads?  Because he's what we all want to do, Sam.  Because you don't believe him, right?  No, because he just walked it like...  A villain.  Why would he say he wants to be a villain just to set himself up for you guys to make firemen for trying to be edgy and like... 
[01:48:30]  Are you trying to be edgy, Iraq?  No, I'm not.  Why would he say he's going to be a villain?  What kind of villain would you be?  He just said he wants to save the show and then he said he wants to be a villain.  That's why...  He doesn't...  He's not consistent.  He's not...  He doesn't follow his own train of logic.  That's why it's fun.  And then he gets mad like you're twisting his words.  Right.  I'm not going to allow that.  What kind of villain would you be?  Venom?  Yeah.  No. 
[01:49:00]  Carnage.  Yeah.  What would your name be?  Yeah.  Or you'd be Lex Luthor.  You'd just be like a really rich guy.  Oh, man.  Yes.  He'd be...  Well, he's got the rich part down.  I'm sorry.  He got that going.  Yeah.  Nagel up in this bitch.  Please tell us what kind of villain or what your villain name would be because they're  coming in already.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  It's a million fat jokes, so there you go.  Oh, really?  No.  I would do Magneto from X-Men.  What? 
[01:49:30]  Because...  Because Edo is in there.  Why does he make it so easy?  Magneto.  Oh, wow.  He sits at home reading X-Men comic books and drinking Coke floats and being like, I'm like  Magneto.  Yeah, we have a lot in common.  Wow.  Wow.  Really?  You like that one, huh?  Like X-Men fan fiction.  Definitely.  Magneto wins every time. 
[01:50:00]  Magneto just kicks ass all the time.  Fuck the X-Men.  Nice.  Kicking Professor X over in that stupid wheelchair.  Oh, his dumb wheelchair.  He's just fucking flipping Wolverine around by his dumb claws.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did the radio...  That's why he's the radio wizard.  How did he talk you back into being the boss?  He had to say something.  I told you.  He said, I was doing a good job.  Everything was going good with the show. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Um, there's nobody else they could really give this position to.  Mm-hmm.  So, it was either that or we would probably have a, you know, possibility of losing the  internship program.  We're not losing the interns.  We wouldn't lose the interns.  You know that, right?  Magneto wouldn't let that happen.  Would he?  What happened?  Come on.  Maybe he's trying to, he's trying to be the leader of the interns so he can build  an army of minions.  Yes.  They can be his little Nagel soldiers.  Oh, man.  The Sex Brigade. 
[01:51:00]  Wow.  Sex men.  Well, I think we could all agree, I rock doing the right thing again.  Jeez.  That's what he wants to hear.  I rock always does the right thing.  Always, huh?  Coke Logic, who's a big Pearl Jam fan.  Yeah.  He's in agreement with me.  He goes, 99 problems, but traffic ain't one.  Oh.  See?  True.  Traffic wasn't one, because who wants that?  I made it to 11.  That's good.  I got there at 3.30. 
[01:51:30]  3.30 p.m. to 11 p.m. is not like, whoa.  That's seven and a half hours on my feet, because I didn't have the fucking VIP seats.  It's 11 o'clock at night on a weekend.  It's not like...  Yeah, but then you got to drive back, and then you got to fucking settle down a little bit.  Drive back.  Wait, what do you mean settle down a little bit?  What does that mean?  You're square.  I'm all pumped up from the Pearl Jam show.  I got adrenaline.  What does settle down mean?  You just got to go home.  I just got to settle down.  Settle down?  See my kid before he goes to bed.  Father shit. 
[01:52:00]  Look at Henry.  He's settling down.  After a show?  No, but it just happens.  I don't consider it part of my time.  No, no.  8, 15 to 9 o'clock, I simmer down.  I got to leave early.  I'm with you at leaving early, but I'm not settling down.  I got to settle down.  Yeah?  Need some downtime.  Why would you just settle down?  Isn't just going home settling down?  I guess.  You have to plan your settling time.  I had the cab ride from hell, though, because the guy was pissed off that he had a, like,  you know, there was a lot of, like, concert traffic.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  So I gave him a nice number to get us to where we had to go.  Oh.  But he decided...  What do you say about Mr. Washington having to get where I got to go?  Huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I gave him a nice number, but he's thinking, whoa, I'm getting a nice number for this fare.  But if I drive 120 miles an hour in the rain, I could get back pretty fucking fast and get  another one.  So why is that a hell road?  That's, like, the best cab ride ever.  In the rain?  Oh, when they just get you from point A to point B.  I don't trust someone going 120 miles an hour. 
[01:53:00]  I don't trust them doing 30 in the city.  Less than 120 being about 85.  I figured this way, the less time you're in the cab, the safer it is.  So if you drive real fast, you'll get out faster.  I was white knuckling it, man.  I was like...  Oh, tell him to slow down.  I was not happy with the speed.  Tell him to slow down, dude.  Have you ever done that?  Yes!  You yell at the cab around you?  I don't yell at him.  I'm like, sir, could you slow down a little bit?  We're not in that thing.  Fuck yeah!  You're like some kind of a crazy person.  I'm not getting paralyzed because this fucking jizz bucket wants to go back and make it as 
[01:53:30]  just $30.  He's trying to get back to get another...  Fuck him!  ...another affair, yeah.  What if you get just injured enough to really sue the fuck out of him?  Dude, that would be nice, right?  Yeah.  Shitting into a bag to sue a cab company who's underinsured so you get 10 grand from the  guy?  You know.  I was...  Not going to lie.  I was scared, man, because the rain was coming down.  The rain started right after the show.  Well, right when I left.  I think Jay-Z might have been performing in the rain at that point.  But you can't be sure?  I'm not sure.  Didn't even see it.  I always say slow down a little crazy.  You have no problem with a cab?  You can't be going really fast?  I just fucking shut my eyes, lean back. 
[01:54:00]  Put your life in his hands.  Right.  Yeah, you don't know the first thing about the guy.  Of course not.  Plus, you're trying to settle down.  I was trying to settle down.  You can't settle down.  It's hard to settle down going that fast.  Right.  Trying to chill out a little bit.  Right.  Take in what I just experienced.  Missed.  Yeah, exactly.  You didn't experience the experience.  I experienced Afrojack.  I experienced Run-DMC.  I experienced the band X.  And some Pearl Jam.  Not the moment, though.  And some fucking, like, I don't know, like some Diana Ross and the Supremes fucking weird thing on a tiny little stage. 
[01:54:30]  That doesn't sound good.  It was horrible.  Sounds like a very dorky concert-going experience.  Does it sound dorky?  Dorky.  What's dorky about Pearl Jam?  Oh, man.  Leaving early to beat the crowd.  Seven minutes.  Settling down.  Settling down.  Yeah, got to take some time to mellow out.  The cab going too fast.  I missed two songs.  The cab went too fast.  Yeah.  Yes.  First of all, the band was loud.  Second of all, he was zipping.  He just slowed down at the stop sign. 
[01:55:00]  Terrible.  Somebody brought grandma to me in America.  Oh, shit.  I had a decision to make, too.  I decided to go no earplugs for my Pearl Jam.  Wow.  When you get a little older, Sam, you're going to understand the shit.  Well, with those seats, why would you?  I mean, it's your dad.  Oh, no earplugs because they hurt the hearing aids.  They're pushing the hearing aids in.  Push them in.  Right.  That's what sucks, man.  You know, you still want to go to shows.  You get a little older.  You can't fucking expose your ears to all these shows anymore. 
[01:55:30]  Let me tell you something.  It fucking hurts the next day.  I got you one word.  Tinnitus, my friend.  Yeah.  Do you have any hearing problems, Sam?  No.  Not yet.  What?  Huh?  What?  Huh?  Huh?  When?  I can't hear a word.  You got that?  I got tinnitus.  I swear.  It sounded.  So when you go to a concert, you're a little paranoid, right?  At how loud it gets?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  During the big Rot Gut show on Friday, all I could think of was, oh, boy, this is going  to take another few fucking decibels off of my hearing. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  It's just, and when I, when I go to sleep at night, if I don't have that TV on, it's  just, picture that your whole life.  Is that why you have the TV on?  That makes sense.  Okay.  Yeah, because I would just lay there and fixate on it.  So you had to get that from the bands.  Yeah.  My hearing shot from doing radio. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't help having to wear headphones.  It's like, oh, my job entails having amplified sound thrown into my ears every single day  of the week.  When I'm in a restaurant and it's, you know, it's a loud, you know, noisy restaurant, I  can't hear, I can't hear the conversation at the table.  It sucks.  But I could hear.  So what is that?  Well, I could hear certain frequencies, but other ones, like, I apparently.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  Some of the, because I could hear, I could hear conversations that are probably a couple  tables away, but someone sitting right next to me in a noisy restaurant, I'm fucked. 
[01:57:00]  This was a few months ago.  I guess the, the power went out in the house and the batteries started going in the smoke  detectors and stuff.  Yeah.  And they give like a beep, beep tone.  Right.  Like that.  You can't hear that?  And, and yeah, no, uh, uh, my girl at the time was saying, uh, cause you don't hear that?  There's a loud beeping noise.  And I'm like, I don't hear anything.  She goes, you're, you're fucking with me.  You can't hear that?  I was like, I'm trying to hear it.  And then I heard this faintest light. 
[01:57:30]  I go, oh, I hear it, but it's really low.  She goes, it's blasting through the house.  You're joking.  I'm not kidding.  That high frequency, gone.  So why would they make that high frequency knowing people will have hearing problems  and their house is burning out?  It should go, oh, something.  Oh, uh, yeah, I know it's, it's the hot, the high frequencies because most people can  hear high frequencies.  Not like, like most people don't do radio for a living.  My fucking ear. 
[01:58:00]  I don't know what the inside of my ears must look like with fucking just a, like an abandoned  fucking house.  Can you change what comes through the smoke detector?  Like, I'm thinking if you have something like, Lordy, Lordy, you'll hear it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, look, we're inside.  Right.  Ah, shit.  Well, I, no, I can hear the smoke detector sound.  I just can't hear the, the warning that the battery's dying in it.  Oh, okay.  Ah, okay.  I see what you mean.  No, the smoke detector itself.  I got you.  Yeah, I hear that.  Okay.  But then there's this high beep.  It's like the beep that you hear from your washing machine that tells, like, the load 
[01:58:30]  is done or the dishwasher.  I was half listening because I came here.  What?  Your sound tells me the load is done.  Ow, my eye.  He's like, came in.  Of course.  It's just me alone saying that.  Then what does he say?  Oh, see, because of the light, Anthony.  Oh, Lord.  So, so let's summarize.  I think we're all in agreement.  We'll winterize.  Take it down, piggy.  I think we're all in agreement that the Opster had a good time at the Made in America show. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, sure.  Uncle Opster.  Do you think that was a dorky concert experience?  Yeah, definitely.  How is it dorky?  It was Nerd-O-Rama.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving early.  This crowd, I'm going to beat the crowd while you're driving like a maniac.  What are you doing?  I'm home, but you know what?  I got to wind down.  I'm settling down here.  You got to settle down.  Settle down.  You got to chill out a little bit.  Some of that adrenaline leave my body.  Rolling his eyes. 
[01:59:30]  I don't want to leave yet.  Come on, we'll beat the traffic.  No, actually, he was ready to go before I did.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, that's the truth.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought you were like, come on.  No, no, no.  No, Pearl Jam.  I've never seen him.  Which is fucking lame on my part.  I should have seen him years ago.  Dorka Palooza.  Oh, wow.  That's not nice at all. 
[02:00:00]  Stop with the thus then shit, Opie.  You sound fucking retarded.  That's why I...  I guess you haven't been listening to the show for a few years, have you?  Huh?  Why don't people understand the dumb basics?  I say thus then to sound like an asshole, you fucking asshole.  An intern and then employee named Spaz used to say thus then in his...  And he was retarded.  And he would say things, so we would put the kitty litter into the hurricane, thus then 
[02:00:30]  absorbing the liquid, thus then ending the hurricane.  He said it all the time.  And you would know that if you were a fan of the show, fucko.  It's an homage.  Yes.  I'm fully aware when I say thus then, it sounds retarded, you dope.  It's zboozda.  It's zboozda.  An introduction book or something.  Right.  We should.  Get a fucking pamphlet.  Some kind of pamphlet that we can send out to the idiots.  You should be...  You should have to pass a basic exam before you're allowed to contact any of us. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Oh, an O&A, like an SAT.  Yeah, because some of these guys don't even understand the basics of what we do.  Yeah.  No.  Whatever.  I'm just glad New York is still the boss of my turn.  It's not in my belly button.  Oh, is it bad?  Did you have cum in it?  No, not bad.  Did you have cum in it?  No, I did arc one last night, too, before bed.  Oh.  Arc one.  You got a good arc still?  That's a good one.  Sometimes.  I can still hit my face.  Oh.  And then there's other times where it fucking, it just, it drools out. 
[02:01:30]  Aw.  It literally just drools out like a kid being thrown off American Airlines.  Do you want to talk about that next?  Aw, poor kid.  It's a great story.  Another plane story.  I kind of believe the pilot, though.  Yeah.  You do?  Yes.  I think so.  We'll explain after these messages.  That's TP. 
[02:02:00]  That's TP.  That's TP.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Welcome back to Yentexplorers with Marge and Gertrude.  Let's join the ladies as they head down to the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean to explore the Titanic. 
[02:02:30]  Boy, this elevator sure the heck is taking quite a long time.  Ah, ha, ha.  I hope no one pushes all the buttons on the way back up.  Oh, stopping at every depth.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, this is like going up into the plane, but going down into the ocean.  Where's the clouds and stuff?  Oh, you're funny.  Up where's the whales and the sonar and not?  Hey, stop here.  I'm going to get off and buy some girdles. 
[02:03:00]  Uh, floor five.  Shoes, hats, and gloves.  Ah, ladies' foundations and other picture postcards.  I'd love to go cave diving under there.  That's craziness.  Sure would.  Hey, cave diving.  What are you doing?  Oh, let's journey to it.  Why don't they go down there and just lift it up with a bunch of ropes?  Just pick it up.  Push it.  It's like, uh, it's underwater.  Water, everything's lighter in the water.  I'd light a ciggy down there in a second.  You can bet.  Quick, get me a Benson and Hedges.  I see the core.  Girl, where's my Chesterfields? 
[02:03:30]  Quick, get me a Moor.  I see the big circle of fire.  I'm smoking.  I'd love to have a Titanic pickle sandwich.  Hold the relish, darling.  This is the last one of its kind.  I'm going to have a little bit of pickle with a side of pickle juice.  Get a star line plate.  I'm starving.  Crikey.  The Yenters made it all the way down.  But will they make it back up?  Find out next time on Yente Explorers with Marge and Gertrude.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[02:04:00]  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  I want to send an F.U. who caught me fucking his fiancee and took it upon himself to call  my fucking wife and post shit online about me that my kids would find indicating that  I was fucking his wife and I was fucking his wife.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to my ex-girlfriend.  You lying, scheming, cuntbag of a fucking bitch.  Well, guess what? 
[02:04:30]  Your smoking hot 18-year-old daughter has moved back in with me now that you are gone.  F.U.  Oh, bitch.  Fuck you!  This goes out to Uncle Kevvy for not answering my fucking phone call.  You know what?  I thought you were a cool guy, but you know what?  You're absolutely not.  Uncle Kevvy, if you're the goddamn shit, fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, I want to give a fuck you to Joe DeRosa.  Man, every time you come in on the show, you talk a bunch of shit.  Somebody calls up or walks in like Dr. Steve with Troy Kwan, and they fucking cut you 
[02:05:00]  down, brother.  Fuck you, Joe DeRosa.  Fuck you!  I'd like to leave a big fuck you to Drew Bully for getting that fucking Me Beardsley song  stuck in my head.  Me Beardsley.  Now, every time I fuck my guy, I keep asking him to get his cock to go back into the left.  Fuck you!  I'm going to fuck you to my wife who wants to go ahead and fall asleep before we're about  to phone.  And she wakes up the next morning. 
[02:05:30]  She's like, oh, I'm sorry, baby.  I passed out.  I'm like, passed out?  Why didn't you pass in or something?  Fuck you!  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  This is serious.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do. 
[02:06:00]  I want to thank Big Lou Bruno on Instagram.  One of the few I follow.  O.P. Radio on Instagram for my Pearl Jam pictures, by the way.  He, uh, he posted a whole bunch of pictures of what Hawaii looks like.  Oh, yeah.  I saw those.  In honor of Sam having no pictures from his big honeymoon trip.  I saw those pictures of, uh, like where Lost was filmed and-  All the cool shit that you-  All the cool shit. 
[02:06:30]  That you should have saw.  I don't do movie tours.  This wasn't a movie tour.  No, we're not going to do the same break as yesterday.  And number two, I told you I have pictures.  I'm just not-  I don't have my photo albums on the internet.  No, you don't have pictures.  Big Lou Bruno, uh, thank you.  Now I know what Hawaii looks like.  You want to see what Hawaii looks like?  Go to Hawaii.  I'm not here to-  I'm not a travel agent.  I'm not here to-  You see those fucking big waves when he was fishing?  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw the big waves.  You know what I did?  I saw the person.  And did you see the volcano shit?  Oh.  And the big waterfall from a helicopter tour?  I told you.  I stood on a lava rock for God's sake. 
[02:07:00]  You went to the road to Hana.  Hana is how it's pronounced.  Hana.  And did you read all the tweets from people saying that it kicks ass?  No.  No, it doesn't.  Not a one.  Well, you should be reading more carefully then.  Not one tweet.  Road to Hana is the shit.  Jay-Z was the shit, too.  How would you know?  Saw it online.  Jay-Z.  You missed it.  Huh?  You missed it.  Yeah.  Rocco was good?  Oh, I was fucking- 
[02:07:30]  Sure.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  They just played fucking, you know, people were there.  It was cool.  No stories?  Yeah, no real stories.  You don't have any stories?  Stories.  You have any good stories from your time off?  No, it was pretty, you know, alternating between hard partying and doing nothing.  You know, recovering kind of a thing.  And putting ice on your swollen eye?  Yeah, yeah.  And my fucking swollen eye and side of my face.  Oh, I got a question.  God. 
[02:08:00]  Because you said you had an allergic reaction to the Just For Men, right?  Yeah, yeah.  For the people not listening yesterday, Ant decided to put a little color in his hair  for the big rock gut gig.  Yeah, because I had the big afro.  And I was like, ah, let me, you know, the old rock gut days, I'll- Jimmy just comes in  and farts.  I'll throw some of that Just For Men in my hair and see what happens.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, an itchy scalp.  Chemical burns.  And the right side of your face was pretty swollen.  Oh, it was all swollen.  It's still swollen.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah, my eye is still fucked up. 
[02:08:30]  Like, it's just- I don't know how they get away with selling that shit.  I think I figured it out.  Yeah.  And be honest.  Uh-huh.  Did you leave the Just For Men in?  No, I left it in for how long did I tell you to?  Four minutes?  Five minutes.  Five minutes?  Five minutes, and then fucking-  You didn't leave it in going, eh, maybe if I leave it in a little-  No, no, no, no, no, no, not at all.  I didn't want it to be like crazy fucking-  I didn't want it to be crazy like that.  Really?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  I adhered right to their rules.  Well, that's pretty fucked up. 
[02:09:00]  And then I shampooed the shit off really well and everything.  And it was fine for that night.  And then by the next day, I started noticing some itching and a rash.  And then fucking by Sunday and Monday, forget about it.  The whole- I had half a Hulk face going on the side of my head.  And my eye was swollen.  Behind my ear on the right side was like fucking-  Like burnt.  Felt like chemical burns.  It's like a scab and fucking all on top of my head is like-  Like just hurting and- 
[02:09:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  Terrible!  I don't believe that.  Keith Hernandez could go suck a dick with that dumb commercial.  I hear his contract's up for that thing, and he's finally going to shave his mustache off.  He wasn't allowed to shave his mustache.  He wanted to get rid of the mustache?  Yeah.  And now there's a picture of him.  It's all gray.  Because he doesn't even use that shit.  He probably tried to use it once and fucking burnt his lip.  Does Keith Hernandez realize he's been- he's looked like an idiot with that mustache since 1990- 
[02:10:00]  I'll give him 1995.  You'll say before that it was okay?  Eh, barely.  Yeah, he was like-  But he's looked like a complete idiot since 95 with that mustache.  There, see?  There he is now.  Look.  That's no just for men in that.  He's got a gray mustache.  I know it's had enough of mustaches.  I know the youngsters are trying to bring back the mustache, but in general, mustaches look stupid.  Mustaches stink.  Your mustache.  You want me to bring in my mustache picture?  Yes.  Oh. 
[02:10:30]  From the 80s?  Oh, God, yes.  Yeah?  You ever see Florentine's mustache picture?  Oh, no.  What an asshole he looked like.  Yeah.  Asshole.  Everyone that's in our age zone has a mustache picture.  Oh, hipster mustache.  The hipsters are trying to bring it back.  Yeah, man.  How long until Sal walks in here with a mustache?  Oh, he is a hipster.  Let's make Sal grow a mustache.  Just give him time.  He'll do it himself.  Yeah, he was going to do it anyway.  Man.  Oh, you think? 
[02:11:00]  Definitely.  That was his thing.  Well, what happened with that kid on the flight there, Jimmy?  You're loving this story.  Jimmy's loving two stories today, by the way.  He's loving the Bob Barker, which we'll get to in a second.  That drives me nuts.  But first, you're into the Down syndrome story.  All I know is there was a kid with Down syndrome who, and not the one who works for us in the other room.  This was a California boy with Down syndrome.  He was not allowed to board an airplane.  Aw.  Now, it was an American Airlines flight, and the family is very angry, and they're saying that he was discriminated against. 
[02:11:30]  But I guess the kid is 16 years old, and they were flying from Newark to L.A., which is obviously a long flight.  And they upgraded to first class at the airport kiosk.  So I don't know if that was the father was a Platinum Elite, or if it was mileage upgrades, or I don't know how they did it, maybe with money.  But they upgraded to first.  They asked the airline to seat the kid and one of his parents together, and the airline complied. 
[02:12:00]  So I guess they went to the front and said, look, we're all in separate seats.  No emergency row for you.  Yes, exactly.  What does this do?  Yeah, the door might look like a big piece of candy.  We don't need that.  It always is candy.  It always is candy.  Now, the family was ready to board, and they were stopped by someone who worked for the airline, and they said that the kid was a security risk.  Oh, boy.  And they would not be allowed to board the flight.  Security risk?  Well, they protested, and they were rebooked on another later flight in coach. 
[02:12:30]  Now, an American spokesman said that the disabled kid, well, the kid was agitated and running around prior to boarding.  Now, acclaim his parents' dispute, but apparently the airline pilot observed the kid, and he made the call.  The pilot himself made the call based on the kid's behavior.  Now, this, again, I don't know.  Well, can I speak?  I'm a parent.  You're always in denial that your kid's doing wrong.  Always, right?  Absolutely.  So, if the kid is acting up, you're going to defend your kid every single fucking time, if someone's saying that, you know, you've got to calm him down. 
[02:13:00]  Well, they said that the parents said that the kid didn't run around at any time.  He didn't make any loud noises, and he didn't display any other offensive behaviors.  They said the boy walked around with him or sat quietly in the gate area.  Now, the mother captured with a cell phone video, I guess maybe we could look this up online.  We would have had this, I think, but there's just, you know, we don't have a full staff.  No, I'm kidding.  I am just joking. 
[02:13:30]  But the boy's mother made a video showing the kid sitting and quietly playing with a baseball cap.  I'd love to see the video.  But Opie's right.  The parents never see it.  Why would the pilot just go and get that retarded kid out of the plane?  You've got to put everything in perspective.  If you have a kid in your house where it's like you're living with a one-man marching band at all times,  calm to those people might be a little different than what we think is calm. 
[02:14:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And this is what they did.  On the second plane, when they were thrown in coach, because, again, it must have been a mileage upgrade,  the family was placed in the last row of the plane,  and no passengers were allowed to sit within two rows of them.  That's why.  Now, retarded people fly.  I mean, it's not like there's never been retarded.  It's not like there's never been retarded people.  Can I see that, Sam?  You're not at home relaxing by yourself.  Oh.  This is a group effort here. 
[02:14:30]  Well, if they did that on the second flight, then you know the kid had something going on.  Because a pilot doesn't just, I mean, look, I don't know any.  Because it's two separate freaking planes, right?  Well, unless they just dealt with them that way based on the one pilot.  But if a pilot says, I don't want that kid on the plane,  man, the kid was not just sitting there quietly.  I don't think so.  While a pilot goes, hey, he's retarded.  Get him off the plane.  Come on.  Maybe the pilot hated retarded kids.  I just, that, that, I have, I believe the pilot.  I think you're right.  Let me see, Sam.  Call my son and made a decision. 
[02:15:00]  Joan and Robert Vanderhorst, who spoke with us through Skype,  tell us as they waited to board American Airlines.  There's the kid holding his hat, looking at his hat.  They were told they weren't allowed on.  Okay, my question is, why are you singling me out and saying,  why aren't you telling them and them and them and all these people that have children  that they have to get into a 3D controlled area?  You cannot be recording this.  Joan opened up her cell phone and began to videotape,  documenting what she believes was a violation of her son's civil rights 
[02:15:30]  and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Her son, labeled a flight risk, can be seen in the video sitting at the gate,  quietly playing with his hat.  In the video, you can hear Joan sobbing and her husband expressing disbelief.  He's behaving.  He's demonstrating he's not.  Is this from the delivery room?  Oh, boy.  Only because we have them.  The family has flown together dozens of times.  The only thing different about last night,  they had upgraded for the first time to first class. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, that's terrible.  Poor people.  That's sad.  Well, maybe the pilot, look, maybe the airline won't.  Well, the video does show the kid, like, pretty much behaving,  but I don't know, you know, what the pilot saw.  Yeah, what did the pilot see?  And first of all, did the pilot, like, know that,  hey, get that retard out of first class.  When you're the pilot, you walk onto the plane,  he probably didn't even know they were in first class.  If you're going to do something like that, though, let me tell you something.  I've been next to fucking all kinds of little bastards on planes, 
[02:16:30]  and they're annoying as fuck.  Yes, they are.  Retarded or not.  Right.  So why don't they just throw all the kids off the fucking plane?  Believe me, I want no one under fucking 14 in first.  If you have a fucking load that is less than 14 years old,  throw it in the back.  I'll sit with him.  Hey, the Oafster's got a kid.  No, I know, but if the Oafster's kid is quiet,  he's welcome to sit next to me.  If not, him and the Oafster can sit in the back.  They're always a problem.  He's done one.  So I don't deal, you know?  My kid did one flight so far. 
[02:17:00]  So far so good.  Was he quiet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Again, Geraldo made a great point.  He goes, what do you want parents to do?  Not fly?  It's like kids are going to cry on planes.  It happens.  But that's just it.  It's like, what, does a pilot come out every time a kid is a little rambunctious  and throws him off the plane?  Or is it just the uretatic?  Well, he's 16, too.  If you're 16 and running around like a baby, that is more of a risk than a...  I said this before I was a parent.  As long as you try to control your kids, that's all I ask for. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  No, I need control.  It's the parents that just go, well, he's a kid, what are you going to do?  And they don't even try to do anything when they know that kid is bothering people around  them.  That's when I lose my shit.  And to this day, that's how I feel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just at least give it the fucking try.  Give it the old college try.  Because, I mean, yeah, there's kids in this world.  You come across them all the fucking time.  And they could be a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  I don't know if the pilot's going on.  It's the parent's job to at least try. 
[02:18:00]  Maybe this big lug was just bouncing off the walls or something.  Maybe.  Because I don't believe the kid was just sitting there quietly.  No, I don't either.  And the pilot goes, that retarded kid's a security risk.  I just don't buy that.  I don't buy it.  Because, again, unless he's in the emergency row, then he has a security risk.  Why haven't other passengers come forward?  That's what I want to...  Because they saw something.  They saw something.  They either saw the kid behaving or the kid really acting up in a way where they decided 
[02:18:30]  they needed to do what they did.  Right?  Yeah, I agree.  Well, we may never know.  Somebody will come forward, though.  Yeah.  But I feel really bad for the parents.  It's humiliating, and they love their son so much, and they just upgraded to first for  the first time.  They're probably like, oh, they get upgraded.  This nice feeling.  It's going to be a comfortable flight, you know?  No.  They're looking forward to it.  And then just...  Their life is hard.  It's so sad, man.  Their life is so much harder than most people would begin with. 
[02:19:00]  And then they're like, you know what?  We're going to fucking just do the right thing.  We're going to do first class.  It'll be nice.  I guess they're probably used to expecting something really nice and special, and then  getting, you know, the shitty end of the stick.  Jesus.  So I'm sure the first class to...  Huh?  Oh, boy.  You're just not right.  You're just not right.  You're just an asshole.  Piece of shit.  You're just scum.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God.  I agree wholeheartedly if you last said that.  I am terrible.  You're funny, man.  Wow.  I do realize we're talking to a few parents out there.  I don't even know.  I would love to...  I'd like to give them a chuckle during the day.  During their hard day.  They're probably...  You know, there's parents out there with retarded kids.  Like, what do you think?  I mean, again, you don't know, because you weren't there.  Call from the Nagels coming in.  Why don't we...  See the difference? 
[02:20:00]  That one was a lot more fun to laugh at.  That one was a lot more fun.  The delivery room line made me laugh before.  No, I know.  They're both funny.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm just fucking around.  I really do have more of a sensitive spot for mentally challenged people.  I really do.  I feel totally horrible.  You see, like, a parent with kids...  All I can think of is, like, how bad it must be for the parents to, like...  Anthony.  You know, they're like, oh, they got to deal with this. 
[02:20:30]  It's hard to raise a, quote, normal kid.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't even imagine.  Yeah, that's got to be tough.  That's got to be hell on earth.  No, I agree.  It has to be hell on earth at times.  I'm just here to make jokes.  Someone's bringing up a bit from the past.  Dumb Dumb was annoying everyone in the terminal with his knock-knock Olive jokes.  Oh, God.  Anyone?  I don't know.  You don't remember Olive?  Yeah, I remember.  Olive.  It went on for two hours.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Olive.  Olive.  It was based on one lousy, I think, 15-second clip. 
[02:21:00]  And we did two hours on it.  Might have to do that in a best of down the road.  That's fucking it.  I would love to hear from some parents.  What do you think happened?  Well, you got people calling, so whoever's screening the calls.  Oh, who's screening the calls?  You're all kids from the plane.  Intern.  What?  That would be Sal.  Oh, boy.  What did Papete Hair do wrong?  Papete.  Papete.  It's not good news. 
[02:21:30]  Maybe his arm hurts.  He can't hit the button really quick because of that new tat.  Yeah.  Someone want to explain to me why we hired Sal?  That's a huge question.  It's a question that needs to be explored.  He was an average intern at best.  So why did he shine?  Who was in his class with him?  Because that's probably it.  Intern Matt.  Ah, see?  Matt made Sal look good.  Is Matt still working for Weez?  Sorry, Sam.  I don't know.  We'd had a string of...  Too scared to ask.  See, Weez throws himself through the window. 
[02:22:00]  He was nuts.  We'd had a string of stupid interns, I think.  Yeah.  Starting in 2004.  And then Sal...  But yeah, I mean, I think...  You know what?  When you surround Sal with, like, the utter shit...  Yeah.  He kind of, you know, looks so shiny.  We actually...  I remember specifically telling him, you know, some people change.  They lose their go-to-itiveness.  They lose their hunger and everything.  As soon as they get hired, they think... 
[02:22:30]  Go-to-itiveness?  Yeah.  What is that?  Go-to-itiveness.  You're...  You're...  I've never heard go-to-itiveness.  The amount of...  You've never heard that, did you?  It's stick-to-itiveness.  Oh, that's what it's called.  Maybe stick-to-itiveness.  You know, definitely stick-to-itiveness.  I mean, I'll have to look it up, but it could be...  I'm telling you.  Are you going to accept that you were wrong?  I'm older than you.  Go-to-itiveness is moronic.  It's stick-to-itiveness.  No one's ever said go-to-itiveness.  No.  Maybe can-do-itiveness.  No, it's called stick-to-itiveness.  Sam never admits to doing anything.  Well, the phone doesn't matter. 
[02:23:00]  The phones are still just ringing...  What the fuck is this?  You're like, what is Sal doing?  He's answering the phone.  Okay, well, is he...  Why is he hanging up on all these people?  I see no, like, typing in anything.  He's probably looking up new tattoos he could get.  Oh, exactly.  People aren't saying anything.  Watch.  Let's go cold here.  All right.  Hi, who's this?  I'm kidding, Sal.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, you're on the air.  Who's this?  Who's on the phone?  Hello?  Oh, boy, what's Sal doing now?  Sal, what'd you do to the phones?  Maybe the phones aren't working today.  Let's see. 
[02:23:30]  The phone screener's not working today.  The phones aren't even working today.  Oh, man.  The phones aren't working.  Oh, Sal.  We couldn't put a phone call on the air even if we wanted to.  Mars getting...  Oh.  What are you...  Oh.  I was screening the calls perfectly.  Yeah?  Well, no, no, no.  Nobody's perfect.  I don't see...  Sal, I like your watch, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  I guess we didn't take a phone call today, huh?  Three hours into the show, we're discovering we don't have phones today.  Wait, wait, how can we not have phones? 
[02:24:00]  I was screening the phone calls.  You said screen a call, you had the screen there perfect.  We're talking about two different things.  Yeah, and nothing's perfect.  You have bad focus.  Two days in a row with bad focus.  Yeah, bad focus.  And then I started screening.  I'm trying to start listening.  Eric was like, oh, just keep screening the calls.  Like, I want to hear them talking shit about me.  Why don't we have phones today?  We need a screener.  I am the screener.  Is it just the sound?  No, man.  Look.  Or is it the phones?  Here's a phone call being hung up on.  Look, nothing.  No tones.  Yeah, but is it the sound?  Yeah, look. 
[02:24:30]  Just nothing.  Yeah?  Have you plugged and unplugged?  Oh, well.  Is the thing off the hook?  Sal!  Oh.  You hate that?  Hey, Sam, can you make sure the radio wizard knows that the big radio show doesn't have  fucking phones today?  Oh, yeah.  Don't we usually test them before the show?  Or is there no way to...  I tested them, yeah.  Oh, no.  You tested them.  Why are you testing them?  You were getting coffee six months ago.  Because the phones weren't set up when I got here this morning.  So I was going to test them.  Why would they be?  There's no one in charge.  Why do people go from getting coffee to the big jobs around here? 
[02:25:00]  You called the phones?  Did you answer them?  Yeah.  And you got a fucking...  He probably answered them just like he's on the show.  Hello, Anthony.  Did you test them through the board?  No, you test them through the board.  I didn't.  Why would you?  Well, he does in fairness to Sal.  Well, he's...  That's not my job.  Oh!  No need to piss on Opie.  I mean, I'm just saying.  I'm not pissing on Opie.  I bet when he was an intern, he didn't say it's not my job.  Exactly.  What can I do?  Yes, sir.  How high?  Opie didn't have to walk around with an umbrella before. 
[02:25:30]  He's officially a member of the Opie and Anthony show.  Welcome aboard, officially.  There's no one to test...  It's not my job.  My job.  No one to test the phones in the morning?  I checked them this morning.  I got a dial tone.  Oh, you did?  Okay, so you test them.  Where?  At open position.  Let's try it again.  I put all the pots up, I turned it on, and I got dial tone.  Of course you put the pots up.  Let's try it again.  Let's try it again.  Call in, folks.  No, no.  Okay, here we go.  Hello?  No.  Hello.  This guy, it's frustrating because he probably hears us right now. 
[02:26:00]  I'll be an athlete.  Oh, yeah, that's a great point.  Thank you.  Uh-huh.  Then what happened?  He's talking.  Tried to put water on them.  I'm going to go back to screening.  There's no reason to screen if the phones don't work.  Exactly.  That's a great point.  Go talk to the radio wizard.  Yeah, go to the radio wizard and say...  Make it your mission to get the phones working, Sal.  I will call someone at broadcasting right now.  No, why don't you go talk?  What does he...  What?  I don't even know what that means.  Exactly.  What does that mean?  Someone else who does a similar job to Mars will... 
[02:26:30]  You see what I mean about him just not being there anymore?  Like, he's not...  There's not the sort of...  He doesn't care.  You think he's lost his luster?  He does, yeah.  He's on tattoo sites now.  He doesn't care.  He's looking, yeah, I'm going to get full sleeve.  Like, there's no above and beyond.  Right?  No, no, no.  It's kind of below...  Right below...  Yeah.  E-Rock's coming in to reset the phones.  Oh, no.  What?  That guy for E-Rock.  That guy for E-Rock.  You don't know how to reset the phones, Sal?  I could give it a try, Sal.  Give it a try?  No.  Yeah, I don't...  Again, it's not my job to do that. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, not my job again.  My job is to answer the phones.  Oh, excuse me.  Oh, here comes E-Rock and his gentle trudge.  Is he...  Is this your job, E-Rock?  Wait, are we just resetting the software?  He tried to quit it, and I wouldn't let him.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock has a little of that above and beyond.  He certainly does.  That Sal does not have.  E-Rock lives above and beyond.  Right.  He's got that go-to-itiveness.  Go-to-itiveness.  Yes, that get-there-to-itiveness-ness.  Go-to-itiveness-ness.  Gum-tion-iveness. 
[02:27:30]  Sam, you shitted.  Yes.  You idiots don't take calls anyway.  We do.  Sometimes we do.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Sal lacks a can-do attitude.  That's true.  He does not have a can-do attitude.  Is that good?  Give it a try.  All right.  E-Rock to the rescue.  Thank you.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, boy.  Try another one.  Well, let's try the dial tone thing again.  The dial tone test is failing.  Oh, E-Rock.  All right.  This is a job for the Radio Wizard. 
[02:28:00]  I think Sal should talk to him.  It's not a job.  Say-all.  And if you say Gary-  No, no.  That is my job.  If you instruct me to do something, that is my job.  You address him as the Radio Wizard.  Let's all have a suck.  Let's all have a suck.  He's going to have to accept his new name.  I'm sorry.  He's the Radio Wizard.  There has to be.  Yeah.  Did you see that video that's going around John Entwistle on the bass for Won't Get Fooled Again, isolated? 
[02:28:30]  He's still standing here, Sal.  He hasn't.  Hey!  E-Rock, what'd you do?  What'd you do, E?  I switched studios.  What?  See?  I switched it over to my studio so you can answer the phone.  So what do I do now?  Answer the phone.  So what are we screening calls in here now?  We don't have a screener.  What do we have a screener?  Well, we don't have one, but we make do.  And we don't really feel like answering phone calls today.  I switched studios.  I want to just hear from parents about this.  Yeah, but Sal's got to screen them better.  Let's just answer this one.  See, let's do potluck like they used to do on the price is right. 
[02:29:00]  Potluck and Sal, we're just taking non-screened calls instead of his.  Yeah.  Let's make it fun.  All right.  One through nine.  Six.  All right.  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, what's up?  Hi.  You're on the air.  What's going on?  Yeah.  It's just fine.  What the hell?  All right.  The phone's working just fine because we fixed them.  What do you got?  Not a damn thing.  You told me to call in, so I just thought you'd call him.  See?  All right.  And this guy'd be like, he hangs up on me every time. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  One more.  One more, Jimmy.  Okay.  One through nine.  That wasn't a good one.  That wasn't a good choice.  Four.  Four.  You're not doing your job.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Chris.  I'm Brooklyn.  How's it going?  What's up, Chris?  All right.  What's a retarded kid and Jess have in common?  Two.  Neither one can get upgraded to first class.  Oh, Jess.  She can't get upgraded.  Oh, Jess.  I thought he said Jets.  I thought he said Jets, too.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:30:00]  Jets.  I ruined the joke.  Oh, I said, what does a retarded kid and a Jess have in common?  They're decision making.  I would say let's go with number one.  Let's go for number one.  All right.  Hi.  Who's this?  I don't know.  Am I on or am I not on?  You're on, sir.  Yes, you're on.  You're on the air, sir.  Yeah.  Morning, guys.  Hi.  Morning.  Chisel boy.  God almighty.  I was screaming at the radio yesterday about him not going first class.  I took my wife to Hawaii last year.  Yeah.  Six of the miles. 
[02:30:30]  We went first class.  What a treat that was.  I heard the miles.  Well, he didn't have a mile, but he could have upgraded.  He's a chisel.  What about the retarded kid?  We were talking about that in the American Airlines flight.  Sorry about that.  Well, we took the red eye back from Honolulu.  Okay.  He might have a tie-in.  Oh.  We walked into first class.  There are six babies sitting in first class.  Oof.  Wow.  Four-year-olds.  We're talking six fucking babies, and they cried from Honolulu to Atlanta. 
[02:31:00]  What a nightmare flight it was.  Fucking...  How annoying that the first class upgrade was really worth it.  Yeah, but that's why I travel with earplugs.  Yeah, or an iPod.  Kenny doesn't have an iPod.  It didn't matter.  We had the headset.  Well, of course, the entire entertainment system was off on the goddamn plane as well.  What was it, Delta?  Yeah.  And the plane sits in Honolulu for over 24 hours before it leaves, and they couldn't fix  the fucking entertainment system.  That's annoying.  Wait, you had to wait so they could fix the entertainment system? 
[02:31:30]  No!  They went fucking super...  Sorry, man.  Yeah.  He's still pissed off from that flight.  Yes.  Really makes upgrading to first class sound great.  No, but that's one bad first class experience, whereas I've had many good ones.  Sam, you chose to do nothing special.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  You're not a special guy.  We went to Hawaii.  That's special.  No.  Well, not if you don't do anything, and you have a basement hotel room.  For one night, and then we switched it to a much more special room. 
[02:32:00]  We're not doing this break again.  That sounds sucky.  Well, then don't challenge me.  Listen to the worst of.  I'm sure it'll be up there in the countdown.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You want to try more phones?  We could try.  It just shows how stupid people are.  By the way, the fantasy football guys are not happy with Mr. Jim Florentine.  Fuck them.  That was hilarious yesterday, though.  Great.  Oh, man.  Look, our satellites are out.  What the fuck is happening here?  What do you think?  I don't know.  It's the HAARP system. 
[02:32:30]  HAARP.  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck is going on.  Liberty Mutual just said, turn this off.  Oh.  Liberty Media.  This costs too much.  Oh, Liberty Media.  I'm sorry.  Liberty Mutual.  Isn't that the intro?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and now this ain't work?  Oh, boy.  Is it a sun spot?  It might be.  You think the sun could just go out?  How do you know for sure?  You wouldn't even know for eight minutes.  You'd be sitting here going, oh, and the sun's just out.  And you'd be going, oh, it's a nice sunny day today. 
[02:33:00]  How do you know the sun can't just go out?  How can it just go out?  That's all it is.  What do you know about the sun?  It's a big fire.  It would have to cease to exist if it went out.  What's in the middle of the sun?  Burns out.  What's in the middle?  The hottest of the haunt.  A hat store.  It's a hat store.  Why does it burn like that?  It's the fucking hydrogen.  It's a big fucking reaction going on.  It's nuclear explosions.  It's great.  It's sucking fucking fuel up from the cosmos. 
[02:33:30]  It's burning itself up.  Ooh, look out.  But it can't just go out one day?  Like tomorrow.  Blow it out.  Tomorrow.  I don't see.  You know what?  It's probably not a 100% that it couldn't.  Thank you.  You know?  I mean, anything's possible.  If the astronauts went up with tons of water.  How much water would it take?  Tons of water.  And then they dropped all this water on the sun as a prank.  And then maybe Obi's right.  Then there would be no sun.  Could we use all the water on Earth to put out the sun? 
[02:34:00]  It wouldn't even make a fucking sizzle.  Really?  And then we'd have no water.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Have you ever looked at the picture of the sun and the Earth right next to it to see the size difference?  That's creepy.  It's like there is.  Let's say they had a hat.  How do they put it?  A million Earths fit in the sun.  What?  That's how many?  A million.  How are you sure about that?  Did you ever put them in there?  I did a test.  I have a life-size something.  You could fit a thousand Earths in Jupiter and a thousand Jupiters in the sun. 
[02:34:30]  That's the size of it.  See?  That's all scale right there.  So we're looking at the size.  If you took a bowling ball and it was the sun, the Earth would be the size of...  A Tic-Tac.  Not even.  Not even, you think?  It's smaller than...  If you put a Tic-Tac next to a bowling ball...  Let's say the sun there is a bowling ball.  That is the size of a...  Like a bug.  Like some kind of fucking...  One pop rock?  Yes.  A single pop rock. 
[02:35:00]  There you go.  Yeah, that's it.  Wow.  We gotta give them more water.  Oh, man.  Oh, wait.  So then all the water on Earth...  Yeah, that would be stupid.  I wouldn't do anything.  It would just boil.  Right now that you see...  I wouldn't do anything.  We're just fucked with that.  Didn't they have a sun flare?  They saw that...  They said something like it was a half a million miles long or something.  Huge, right?  What did they say?  What did NASA say?  It was something crazy that people were checking out yesterday.  The official word was, it was as big as shit. 
[02:35:30]  It was big as shit.  NASA says...  When Jupiter got hit with Shoemaker-Levy, the impact was enough to wipe our planet out.  When you look...  If you want to see how...  A couple of Jews.  Two Jews punched a planet.  But look for...  If you find the Shoemaker-Levy impact crater when the comet hit, that, they said, was the  size of the Earth.  It was the explosion on Jupiter.  Oh, man.  Really?  Like, uh...  You start getting to this galactic-sized shit, it just gets crazy. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, like one of those or some small little dot in there, that would have wiped this out.  Really?  Yeah.  Easily.  The law firm of Comet, Shoemaker, and Levy.  Yeah.  I was thinking more of a morning show.  Morning show?  Hey, Shoemaker and Levy in the morning, we're a blast!  Blah, blah, blah!  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh.  What's going on with Mars?  He's out.  He's off for, um...  Who can tell?  Oh, that one.  Why don't we give a shit about the rover?  It's roving. 
[02:36:30]  It's roving.  And that's it?  We're like, all right, go rove, we'll go fucking do something else now?  Yeah, and then when it finds, like, cool shit, it does cool shit...  It's never gonna find cool shit.  It, uh...  It, uh...  People tell us, and they send pictures.  You haven't seen the pictures?  I've seen a couple cool pictures, and then I'm like, all right, what else you got?  Pretty fucking cool.  Look at that shit.  It is cool, but now what, though?  No, the planet, but now what?  Now what?  Um, I don't know.  What is there left to do?  Seriously.  It's doing experiments with lasers, and then it picks up rocks and dumps it inside it, and 
[02:37:00]  there's a little laboratory inside the thing, and it figures out shit.  But what if there's trees on the other side of the horizon, and the rover's never gonna  get there?  No.  Unfortunately.  It's kind of like if, you know, they landed in our dumb desert, they would just think our  planet's shitty, right?  Yeah.  They would never get to the cool stuff.  Or if they landed in, like, the Antarctic.  How do we know we didn't...  We could have landed on some cool stuff on Mars.  Why do they guess on that area?  I guess.  We've taken enough pictures of it, I think.  Yeah.  It's an old crater or something?  If they would have seen, like, Manhattan, they probably would have landed there, you know, 
[02:37:30]  over the years.  Ah, let's go to this deserted desert.  Fuck that big city with moving vehicles.  It's an old crater, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They're on the inside of a crater.  And they figure that's the best place to land this rover?  Yeah.  It's just roving around.  God, it's just not gonna find anything.  And then their experiment's gonna be who gives a fuck.  Pretty creepy that it's just there going...  It is creepy.  Just roving around.  There's nothing on that planet.  Nothing. 
[02:38:00]  I'd like to go there and just skip.  Like, I don't wish you were there and you could just skip in front of the camera how much  that would freak everybody out.  It would freak everyone out.  There's a man skipping on Mars.  We got some real calls coming in about that situation.  Oh, situation.  Brett in Baltimore.  What's up, Brett?  The sun is attempting to eat the wing.  What's up, Brett?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Brett, welcome.  What's up?  My brother's retarded.  We've been kicked out of hotels, flights, everything. 
[02:38:30]  And it's never been...  It's always for a reason.  My brother's acting crazy.  He's being loud.  And they kick us out.  It'd be just...  You know, if you were throwing a party in a hotel room or people are too drunk to get  on a plane.  It's the same concept.  If you're being belligerent, you're not going to be able to stay at the hotel or go on the  flight.  So when you guys get kicked out of hotel rooms and flights, do you understand or do you  get pissed off?  No, we absolutely understand.  Yeah, that sucks, man.  These people don't want something.  They just want attention. 
[02:39:00]  There's something.  They're going after something.  You're just aware that you're going to be kicked out of some situation.  They're going after situations, unfortunately.  Exactly, yeah.  I mean, again, if your normal person's being loud or being belligerent, you're going to  get kicked off the flight.  Well, I think you said it, too.  It's like, compared to what they're used to, he might be really quiet, but their quiet  for him is not what other people find acceptable quiet on a flight.  Right.  He might have been just like, you know, making a little bit of racket or whatever, but...  But yeah, it's always for a reason.  There's never, ever been, hey, your brother's retarded and you're not going to be able to 
[02:39:30]  go on this flight.  He's always doing something.  Right.  They've got to be careful how they handle the situation.  That's what I figured.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah.  Let me go to Dinny.  It says Dinny.  Is it Dinny?  Yeah.  It's Vinny, Opie.  How you doing?  Vinny.  Jesus.  Sal got that way wrong.  Why would you think, if you didn't hear it completely properly, why would you think it's  Dinny instead of a name, which is Vinny?  You know, I have known a few... 
[02:40:00]  I read it to him twice.  I said Dinny and he said yes.  I said it to him twice.  Have you ever met a Dinny in your life?  No.  Hold on, Vinny.  You're a vope.  Have you ever met a Dinny in your life?  Oh, Sal.  No, but sometimes people call up with stupid handles and stuff like that, you know.  The honeymoon's over with this Sal, kid.  Oh, this Sal is just a piece of shit.  We've got to get one of the interns now tuned up to replace Sal by the end of the semester.  We can fire Sal, right?  Totally.  Yeah.  Cool.  Cool.  Well, what's happening with the TVs? 
[02:40:30]  This is weird.  DirecTV is having some issues.  Vinny, what do you got, buddy?  So, Opie, I have a son with autism.  He's 17.  And you're right.  What's normal to us is not normal to others.  And what happens is when they see a 17-year-old kid, you know, shouting Disney lines at the  top of his lungs, people get a little nervous and they don't understand it.  But, you know, he flies two, three times a year.  As long as you give him his cookies and his video, he stays quiet while the rest of the 
[02:41:00]  people are going nuts in the back with their four-year-olds, screaming and puking and doing  everything else.  So, I think the pilot just saw something he didn't understand and made it.  But wait a minute.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Oh, you think the pilot's in the wrong here?  Yeah, I do.  Okay.  But you said your kid screams Disney lines at the top of his lungs.  So what?  That's fine if it's home.  But do you think if that's in the airport, the pilot doesn't have the right to go, he  shouldn't be on the flight?  The pilot has the right to do anything he wants, Jim. 
[02:41:30]  You're absolutely right.  But what security risk does someone yelling at Disney lines?  And my wife and I are doing everything we can to, you know, help them be quiet.  We give them different things to try to keep them quiet.  But in the end, we have a right to fly just as everyone else does.  My son's not going to hurt him.  Let me answer your question.  The security risk is this.  Because you, if you don't know that, like you don't know your kid, you're just a pilot  and you see a kid yelling Disney lines, you're thinking this person is going to be a problem 
[02:42:00]  on the flight.  Security people are going to try to talk to him.  There's going to be an issue.  Just because something says security problem, it doesn't mean they're trying to take over  the plane and crash it.  It's like if a regular, let's say a non-autistic was sitting there yelling Disney lines, every  rational minded passenger would go, other people have the right to fly without sitting  next to somebody shouting.  Oh, here's the problem.  It's not actually the movies.  It's Disney, Walt Disney lines.  Very anti-Semitic.  He's just blurting out how the Jews are ruining the world. 
[02:42:30]  Oh my God.  How'd you know, Anthony?  I know it.  I disagree with you, man.  If he's yelling and making loud noises, he should be treated like any other passenger.  Noises.  I hear what you're saying, but he's not on the plane yet.  Come on, that's not fair.  You don't know how the kid is going to react on the plane.  So really, when he gets on the plane, he knows what he has to do.  He quiets down.  He puts his headphones on and you won't hear another word out of him.  But sitting in an airport for three hours is a really disruptive thing to people with 
[02:43:00]  anxiety disorders, which autism is a big component, is anxiety disorders.  But listen to what you're saying, though.  You're expecting the pilot or other airline personnel to make the judgment call that this  kid who is yelling in the airport is going to suddenly settle down on the plane.  You should try to, whatever it is that helps him quiet down on the plane, that should be 
[02:43:30]  implemented in the airport.  But I would imagine Vinny's experience.  It doesn't work that way.  But you're also very experienced with this whole thing, so I'm sure you've had conversations  with people over the years to assure them that your kid's going to be all right.  We have, and people have asked us.  We've had folks at the desk when we've gone to check in say, is there anything we can do  to help?  And we say, yeah, if you let us get on the plane first, he'll quiet down right away. 
[02:44:00]  He just wants to get on the plane because he's going to Disney World, and his last six months  have been all about obsessing about going to Disney World.  And I can understand, because he's pulled a few tricks to get on the plane.  I've got to get on that plane quick.  Before anyone asks.  I've got to get on that fucking plane.  Vinny, I've got to ask, man.  How hard is it to raise a child like that?  I've got to tell you, Opie, originally it was hard.  And when we're around people that have typical children, sometimes it gets difficult because 
[02:44:30]  you forget about the dreams and stuff that you lost when your kid was not typical.  But today, I wouldn't trade him for a 17-year-old typical kid.  I'm so glad I don't have a daughter.  I'm glad I don't have a 17-year-old boy out there trying to knock up every 16-year-old.  My kid's happy to sit home and watch a Disney movie with me.  Can I say, when you say typical, is it easier to say that than quote-unquote normal? 
[02:45:00]  Is that like an easier term to use?  Yeah, that's what we use.  People who are in our world use the word typical because there is no such thing as normal, Jimmy.  You're normal, but some people don't think you're normal.  There is such thing as normal, though.  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but the problem with normal is that people put a judgment  of right or wrong.  Yes, there's a normal thing.  There is a norm.  In this world, there is a normal thing.  Sure, there is such a thing as normal.  Yeah.  But what's normal?  And who decides what's normal? 
[02:45:30]  Me.  Yeah, Jimmy or Anthony.  No, but I'm not saying you're wrong to say that.  I was only asking because I heard the term twice.  But the society kind of, there is a norm.  We understand what the norm is.  I mean, we can't pretend we don't.  Fun show.  Vinny.  Knowing your kid has these issues, right?  Why would you tell him, I picked up on this, six months in advance you're going to Disney.  I would tell him the second you're off the plane.  I would tell him as you're taking the luggage out of the car. 
[02:46:00]  He's not unaware of the world around him.  I'm just fucking with you, to be honest with you.  I'm just fucking with you.  It's funny.  It's like, oh, boy.  Yeah, I'm just fucking with you.  I figure he picks up on shit.  Yeah, he's planning the trip the day we get home.  Right.  You know, he wants to know if I booked the flight yet.  You know, what room we're staying at.  You know, it's his vacation.  My wife and I go to the Bahamas a couple of months later by ourselves after the vacation so we can have one. 
[02:46:30]  Does your kid truly, is he truly happy?  Like you see that he's just a happy human or what?  Absolutely.  He's the happiest, most loving kid that I know.  He, you know, what's great about his disability is he trusts everybody, and he thinks everybody is wonderful.  Well, that could be bad, right?  It's scary as hell.  You know, we're trying to figure out what are we going to do when he becomes, you know, 21, 22. 
[02:47:00]  Do we want him to live with us forever, or do we want to set him up in some kind of, you know, some type of alternative living, or what are we going to do?  We don't know that yet, so that's the scary part.  But, you know, right now everybody he meets, he loves.  Hey, can you hug him?  Like, I know some autistics don't like to be touched.  Can he be touched, or is he fine with affection?  Oh, he's wonderful with affection.  Oh, okay.  All he wants to do is hug.  Try hugging Sam.  And that makes people uncomfortable.  We'll have an experiment right now. 
[02:47:30]  Try hugging Sam.  Sure.  Well, Sam is what we call non-typical.  He's not a typical.  He's definitely a non-typical person.  Don't touch me.  Don't try to figure out how Sam got a girl out here.  Listen, I get them all.  Remember that.  You know, Club Soda Kenny's thing today?  What's his thing today?  Will you allow me to read what he just texted me?  Is it respectful or disrespectful?  I'm resigning.  It's a little rough.  It's a little rough.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I'll allow it.  All right. 
[02:48:00]  Club Soda Kenny just texted me, and he said,  The marriage won't last.  He didn't fly first class, and he doesn't eat ass.  That's right.  I guess Kenny is the authority on unhappy marriages.  What does that say about him?  No, it's that he's an ass, and he knows what's not like the...  42 years of the marriage, Sam.  You got to eat ass.  The eating ass, I'll consider.  It's for the young, Vinny.  It's for the young.  It's never for the young, Ope.  I don't know, man.  It's for the young.  I love the fucking TV.  I love eating ass.  Get right in there. 
[02:48:30]  Let me ask Anthony.  Would you eat the ass of a 40-year-old that was put together nicely?  40?  Yes.  That's my number today.  It's probably the high limit if it's really nice.  Really?  Yeah.  That's stretching?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is pushing it.  That's still 11 good years of ass eating.  And I got to be really fucking drunk.  I would imagine.  Yeah.  All right, Vinny.  Thanks for...  Thanks, Ope.  Thanks, Vinny.  Yeah.  Good phone call. 
[02:49:00]  That's got to be rough.  But to me, he made the pilot's case, but because it's a hard judgment call to make when somebody  is being loud and disruptive in the boarding area.  It's very hard to take on faith.  Yes, once we're 30,000 feet, because if he's...  Let's just say the kid is loud the whole time, and the pilot doesn't know, and he screams  and yells, then you have to find an airport to land at to remove...  Oh, my God.  It's a nightmare for a whole plane full of people.  You know, it's a hard one to handle. 
[02:49:30]  And the parents have a job to do.  They have to convince everybody, no, he's acting up because of this, but he'll be fine  if we do this.  Let's just Trank Dardom.  Yeah, look, what if turbulence makes him do that?  Like, if this hard thing, even once he's on the plane, if he's really quiet, what if  ears popping makes him do that?  Oh, because he doesn't understand.  But, you know, who knows?  He thinks some more smart vapors leaking out of his head.  He's just gulping.  It's like, oh, it's the last bit of smart vapor.  Most people that complain on the plane don't have kids. 
[02:50:00]  That is the God's honest truth.  Absolutely.  You're right.  I have more of an understanding now that I'm a parent.  Yeah.  But still get pissed off when a kid's acting up and the parents don't try.  Do nothing.  Right.  Like I said, that's my fucking limit.  When they're bouncing, the kids show, okay, hey, and they're trying.  It's like, you know, all right, I would hate to be that person.  I could put my headphones on.  Terrible.  A couple more want in on this.  Jimmy, what's up?  I'm good.  I'm just relaxing.  I'm doing my job today.  Kick an ass, take a nap. 
[02:50:30]  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  How are you, sir?  Hey, I feel bad for all the folks that are calling about the retarded kids, but, you  know, I'll give you my perspective as a single guy.  Ooh.  A stud.  If I'm by the way to the board of playing and a kid is going crazy, and, you know, with  retarded kids, you don't know their age.  He's a 16-year-old kid.  He probably looks like he's 35, and he's going nuts before you go on.  You know, I could see passengers going up to the pilot who probably didn't even realize 
[02:51:00]  what was going on, but adding their two cents to it.  Yeah.  Because, you know, it's an easy way to complain and get what you want, especially when it  comes to a situation like this.  And you're right about when, again, the important thing is the kid was not always a Down syndrome  baby.  He was 16 years old.  And you're right.  Retarded kids are strong.  I mean, people joke about retard strength, but you don't, getting onto a plane, you don't  know.  You're up to lifting the console. 
[02:51:30]  You don't know if it's going to be an issue.  Yeah.  And that's where the security risk can come in.  So it's not unreasonable for a pilot to say that.  I would just feel bad.  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't, I swear to you, I wouldn't be bothered.  You'd have to feel really bad about it.  I would just feel so bad.  Yeah.  I really would.  It'd be a little annoying, yeah, but I would push that down and...  Oh, I'd be out of my mind.  Would you?  Would you?  Fuck, yeah.  I would just feel so fucking bad.  I feel bad.  I would think about what a tough life that is for everyone involved.  Yeah, I guess so.  I wish I, and that's probably the right way to think. 
[02:52:00]  That's a more compassionate way to think, because I just think selfishly of my own flight experience.  My own creature comfort.  Yeah.  I would get way madder at, like, I'll say it, a normal kid that's acting up with the parents  not doing anything.  That would drive me...  A typical child.  A typical child following his lead.  I'm going to use that around.  If you're sitting next to him halfway through the flight and he's going nuts, I don't think  you're going to feel bad.  You're going to be looking for the retard cage in front of him on a little one.  Jesus.  Retard cage. 
[02:52:30]  What the fuck?  Holy shit.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  That is scary, though.  I mean, again, if you're next to somebody who's really strong.  Because they're thinking of...  But then again, there's a lot of crazy people who aren't retarded who have tried to open  the door and cause problems.  You know, so you get plenty of fucking lunatics, too.  I do imagine.  I was just going to say, I think it also depends on how long the flight is, too.  Yes.  And imagine a situation like...  That's rough.  That's rough.  Like with the plane that landed in the river.  And now you just want to get out immediately. 
[02:53:00]  And now there's a problem in front of you for an exit or something.  Why?  He's got the strength.  Yeah.  Wow.  In that situation...  The strength to turn around and go the wrong way against everybody else.  You're like, oh, God, please.  I'm thinking of that situation.  Like, fuck, why did they kick that kid off the plane?  Yeah.  We could rip the whole side of the plane off for us.  I don't know.  More or no?  Yeah, yeah.  Why wait until the doors are shut to make a decision like that?  Was the kid on the plane or he wasn't allowed to board? 
[02:53:30]  Or they're saying, why should the pilots wait?  Yeah.  What are you saying, person?  Nah, all right.  Mike in Denver.  Mike?  Mike?  Hey, Mike, your Broncos suck.  Oh, well, they might be coming back this year.  But, you know, real quick on that, but, you know, it's like, he said, well, he acts  better on the plane.  You know, once he gets on the plane and everything like that, so the pilot's supposed to make  the decision, once he's on the plane and the door's shut, the kid's going to be all 
[02:54:00]  right?  No, of course not.  He's going to make it in the terminal in the airport.  Are you making this phone call from the cockpit, by the way?  I'm going to listen to you.  You sound like a pilot.  There's the boater video again.  The video rules.  All right, Mike.  Yeah, to nothing.  Thank you for that, though.  Let me say hi to Derek in Connecticut.  Derek.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hi, Derek.  Welcome aboard from CT.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I was on a plane from New York to San Francisco. 
[02:54:30]  Wow.  Sounds exciting.  Tell us about a cocksucker.  Yeah, exactly.  What were you doing out there, liberal?  There was a gentleman in his 20s who had Tourette's, who was scaring the shit out of pretty much  everyone on the plane.  He was just saying what everyone was thinking when the flight attendants were walking by.  Old cunt!  Old cunt!  Food sucks, cunt!  Love it.  So, I don't understand what the difference is in having Tourette's, because you're still 
[02:55:00]  scaring the shit out of people.  I'll hang up and listen.  I think people's thinking is, and I'm just guessing, that somebody with Tourette's, people  I think understand what the limits, like you yell stuff and it's annoying, but I think  they're not afraid of your irrational behavior.  I think if you're retarded, people are more afraid of what you might do with your lack of  mental capacity.  That's me guessing as a stud.  I'm afraid of Tourette's people.  Are you?  Yeah.  I think it's yell cunt in the middle of a fucking crowded room. 
[02:55:30]  What else are they capable of doing?  I respect their honesty.  Yeah, really.  That's some scary shit.  It takes balls to be able to yell that.  Yeah.  It takes balls to be able to fucking sing.  I know it's a mental thing, but fuck.  Nickels!  They always try to change it.  There's black people around me and they start going, nickels!  Nickels!  I've seen that too.  They're just afraid of getting punched.  Yeah.  Would I eat Jane Seymour's ass?  Hell no.  No. 
[02:56:00]  Jane Seymour.  I fucking hate Jane Seymour.  I don't care how good her eyes are.  Oh, God.  God damn.  It's just awful.  Jesus.  Jane Seymour.  Oh, God.  No.  No.  Remember?  I hate her.  She turned my mom down for an autograph.  Find an old school picture of Jane Seymour.  Where was it?  We were going up to see Phil Donahue.  Back in the day.  And where was Jane?  In the elevator.  We got...  I told the story a million times.  We were coming down from the Phil Donahue show and we got an elevator and next thing 
[02:56:30]  you know, it's us and Jane Seymour.  No one else.  And my mom was a big fan of, I don't know, was it the medicine woman?  Dr. Quinn.  Dr. Quinn medicine woman.  And my mom actually put herself out there and said, big fan, can I have an autograph?  And she said no.  And then the ride down was awkward.  In front of the family?  Just me, my mom, and Jane Seymour.  What a cunt.  I've told the story many times.  She's a twat.  Look at her there, though.  There's some older pictures.  She's lesser of a twat.  Look at that. 
[02:57:00]  What's wrong, Sam?  Chip is squeezing the pot.  Why are you giving us looks as we're trying to do a radio show?  Not you, Chip.  Shut up.  You shut up.  Fucking Jane Seymour.  How about Jane D-E-F-more?  Fucking go ahead and take us out, you fucking snob.  And now, the O.B. and Anthony Show presents Getting High with Ron Howard and Seth Rogen. 
[02:57:30]  Yo, Ron, man.  Pass that bong, son.  Oh, shit.  Seth's here, dude.  Really?  Yo, what up, Rogen?  You want to hit this?  Yeah.  Yo, check out this fucking drinking out of cups video, dude. 
[02:58:00]  It's fucking nuts.  Who's this guy?  Mr. The Woods.  What the hell is this?  No, wait.  No, wait.  Yo, Seth.  Seth, you want to hit this again, dude?  Give me more.  What are we doing?  I don't know.  Am I that fucked up?  Well.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  That was Getting High with Ron Howard and Seth Rogen.  Get ready, America.  Today's hottest impressionist is coming to a theater near you.  Jim Morton, man of a thousand voices, live, in concert.  All your favorite celebrities are here.  Bill Clinton.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  Samuel L. Jackson.  That girl got snakes near a plane.  Sylvester Stallone. 
[02:59:00]  Baby.  You're going to have to get a lot of body bags if that girl's coming to town.  And Christopher Walken.  Oh, I carried this iPhone in my butt.  Jim Norton, man of a thousand voices, live in concert, coming to a theater near you.  Sirius, Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:59:30]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Who's Linda Cohn?  Huh?  Kevin from Connecticut once told if I would eat Linda Cohn's ass.  What else is she?  She's 53, but she's hot.  Oh, boy.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  Oh, God, no way.  For the story, I really would.  Oh, you know what that would look like?  Stop it.  You wouldn't even be able to do it.  You'd gag.  But for the story, I would.  But all the in-between people, hell, fucking no.  But Betty White, absolutely.  You'd gag.  She's 90, right?  You'd look and you'd be like...  It probably doesn't smell too bad. 
[03:00:00]  The wrinkles and the fucking overlapping flesh, the roids, the skin tags.  What do you think it looks like?  The gray hair.  Like an old Mexican cave.  Oh, it's like twisted.  It's not a nice pucker anymore.  You know, a nice young edible asshole looks like this.  Like your lips go, whoo, whoo, nice and tight.  Her eyes looks like, me, me, me.  You think her asshole has lost its seal?  Yes.  The seal is gone. 
[03:00:30]  Long gone?  That o-ring is shot.  Long gone?  Yeah.  There's no fixing this.  Who's this brud?  Oh, she's that ESPN brud.  No.  She's not 53.  She looks pretty good.  She looks good for 53, but no.  Hell no.  That's the in-between people.  She's like, hi.  You got to go really old for the story and the goof, or you keep it with the young.  She's fucking on her elbows and fucking knees, looking back.  Come on.  Do I call her Betty?  With her post-menopausal voice. 
[03:01:00]  Eat my ass.  No.  No, she has that meh voice, actually.  Well, Betty White.  Yeah, but this...  Oh, this brud.  No.  No.  No.  Would you eat Betty White's ass there, Sam?  No.  Why not?  You don't eat any ass.  Yeah, I'm going to start with Betty White.  You never ate an ass?  No.  What a creep.  God.  Sam's a creep.  Is there a reason for that?  Like, I could understand that no steak or drinking or whatever the fuck you don't eat.  Whatever the fuck. 
[03:01:30]  But, like, what's wrong with an ass that makes it so you don't want to eat it?  No, it's just...  I mean, before working here, I guess, it didn't occur to me.  It wasn't on...  What's the first thing I thought of when I saw an ass when I was a kid?  Jesus.  Boy, I let them put my face in that for three hours.  Yeah, but you also like girls to pee in their pants and sit on you.  I mean...  Exactly.  What are you living over there living your fucking lollipop life?  I'll be honest.  What's the first thing I thought of when I saw a girl?  Right.  Dude, an ass is so nice.  It took a while for me to get to that point.  I've got to get down in there.  I hate when they don't let you...  I don't know. 
[03:02:00]  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  You want to eat Betty White's ass?  Come on.  There is no way I would even get near that.  What would you do for the story of the goof?  Not for the story.  You don't do anything for the story of the goof, ever.  The story is the fucking...  Well, that isn't even a good story.  He got stories.  So, dude, I was eating Betty White's ass.  That isn't even a good story.  You don't think it's a good story?  No.  You're probably right.  That's just a fucking disgusting thing to have happen.  I guess you're right.  You know what her shits are probably like? 
[03:02:30]  Either fucking concrete cinder blocks or a babbling brook coming out of her ass.  I would guess...  Shits are probably terrible.  I would guess gray, almost dry cement.  You know what I mean?  Looks like old dog shit in the yard.  White powder on it.  Where the edges are still that dark gray, but the middle is that white gray.  That's her shits every day.  Or probably has pieces of her colon attached to it.  Ooh, that was a good one.  She's all happy about it.  She's 90. 
[03:03:00]  90, 90, pushing 91 at this point, right?  91 years old.  But that's great.  That's still doing it.  She's funny as fuck.  Still relevant and fucking hilarious.  That's really nice to see.  Yeah, that's great.  Still acting at that age?  Wouldn't eat her ass, but, you know, yeah, that's pretty good.  Would you suck on her nipples?  Yeah.  Right.  Please.  Depending on how she's sitting, it's probably like eating her ass.  I said...  It's right there.  And I said that correctly.  I said suck on her nipples, because I would imagine the tit is just pretty much gone,  and that's about all that's left.  What nip?  It's a hanging nip. 
[03:03:30]  You ever see the pictures of those old woman tits?  The nipple loses any fucking pigment whatsoever.  Let's go with old woman tits.  All you see is like a lump where the...  Well, a little dot where the nipple is, but there's no coloring to it anymore.  It's just fucking disgusting.  Ugh.  God.  What do you look for?  Elderly tits?  What's...  Wait.  The second one in...  It's not elderly.  That's not bad.  You'd go there.  This is probably like...  This is 30-something. 
[03:04:00]  Because that's probably like, these are not elderly tits, you know?  You put it elderly.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  No, Sam.  No, no.  You got to look like that fucking woman that's sucking that guy's dick up there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's terrible.  One more.  Oh, my God, Sam.  Wow.  One over.  Two over.  Now your weight...  Keep going.  Ugh.  One up.  One up from where you were.  One more over.  One more...  Did you do that on purpose?  That was so hard to...  Yeah, she's not even elderly.  No, she's pretty fucking disgusting. 
[03:04:30]  All right, but her boobs looked really old, so we were tricked by that one.  Trickery.  Fucking trickery.  Ugh.  No.  No, that's not really...  You got to put, like, geriatric tits.  Try that.  Yeah.  Elderly porn.  All right, elderly porn.  You know who loves elderly porn?  Who has a fetish for, like, really old women?  DeRosa.  Edgar.  Oh, no, Edgar.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, what does he say? 
[03:05:00]  He does.  She's wonderful.  Oh, wonderful.  Lay there together.  He likes the way their skin tastes, like the folds of their neck.  Ah!  You kiss it, and his little tongue darts out, and it's tarts.  What are you talking about?  Ugh.  God, that grosses me out.  Why the old lady's pubic hair looks like a spider web?  What happens?  Why wouldn't you just shave it at that point?  Look at that.  What is she going to shave for?  There's a lot of space in between the individual pubic hair there. 
[03:05:30]  She ain't shaving for shit.  No.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Let me see.  Yeah.  There's nothing really elderly, elderly there.  Well, we had our famous century porn.  Century sex.  Where's our century sex tape?  You still have it, E-Rock?  No.  No, we gave it away.  Oh, fuck.  Why would we ever give that away?  When we were leaving the old place, we gave away everything in the offices.  Even that?  Yeah, everything went.  That was a classic. 
[03:06:00]  Wow.  Bob Barker.  Jimmy's obsessed with the Bob Barker story.  Oh, really?  I guess Bob Barker, well, we all know he, we do know he hosted the places, right?  For 35 years, they were having their 40th anniversary special, and they didn't invite Bob Barker.  Drew Carey has been hosting it for five years.  How do they not, how do they not invite Bob Barker back?  I know he's been critical of the things they've given away, like...  No, he's a big animal rights guy. 
[03:06:30]  Yes, so he asked him...  Huge.  And he would say at the end, have your animal spayed, neutered, which, all right, that's  fine.  And he said he didn't want any fur coats or leather jackets, so they did stop doing that.  Yeah.  He hated when they gave away trips to the SeaWorld.  Yes, and I agree with him.  He says that's an awful place.  Really?  He's right.  It is an awful place.  I've been to SeaWorld.  You don't like them to kill the whales, do a flip?  No, but it's...  I would imagine they take care of him.  Nah, but when you see that dolphin documentary, how they get the dolphins for that, the whole 
[03:07:00]  thing just sucks.  So I'm on his side there, but for the fact that he hosted the show for 35 years, and  these network cocksuckers don't even invite him back for the special, how do you...  And of course, the network had no comment.  Well, the network, no, they did comment in an article I read saying that it was more about  the contestants.  They were bringing back the...  Who gives a shit about the contestants?  Exactly, the assholes.  I guess that's how they're spinning it, right?  Yeah.  Because they didn't want Bob Barker?  Because you're right.  Why would you have an anniversary special without Bob Barker, no matter what? 
[03:07:30]  No one knows Drew Carey as the host of Price is Right.  I see him every once in a while at the gym on a TV.  When you hear Price is Right, you think of Bob Barker.  Of course.  That's pretty much it.  Why would he take that gig?  I think of Bob Barker holding that shitty little microphone daintily.  Oh, that big long...  Daintily.  It's the long stick microphone, and he'd hold it right at the bottom very daintily.  Yes.  What years did he host, Sam?  Look that up, please.  Instead of fucksing around with you wrestling online, he was done in 2007.  Oh, no.  Okay.  He was taping...  I think that's the full-time host he ended in 2007. 
[03:08:00]  The Price is Right!  But then they said he was still taping in 2009, so I beat it a special.  Was he part-time or something?  And his first appearance was 1972.  72.  He basically says that he hosted the show for 35 years, and now they're celebrating their  40th anniversary.  Ha ha, yeah.  Great.  And they don't invite him.  What a network cocksucker move that is.  Maybe he's an asshole.  I'm sure he is.  But you know what?  He's 88, and if it wasn't for him, the franchise wouldn't be there now. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, true.  So what if he's an asshole?  Yeah, you gotta invite him.  Come on down!  Who hasn't yelled...  Television Studios in Hollywood!  Have you guys watched Wheel of Fortune lately?  No.  I know this is probably a hack bit, but it has to be said, Vanna White literally just  stands there now.  Oh, yeah.  She doesn't have to do anything.  She went from turning the letters to touching the letters.  Now she just stands there.  Wait, they don't even need her to do anything? 
[03:09:00]  No.  Oh, wow.  Why wouldn't they...  She just stands there.  But Vanna White was huge for that show.  Why wouldn't you just say, fuck technology?  She's going to still spin the stupid letters.  Maybe she can't anymore.  How old is she?  She's got to be so old.  That was the 80s, that show, for fuck's sake.  You know what?  The Vanna White reference.  I'd eat her ass.  Yeah, Vanna White, you gotta eat her.  She's 55.  You got it.  Vanna White is 55.  Let me see a picture of her son.  I thought she was old on that.  You got it.  God, was that her in the fucking bikini?  No. 
[03:09:30]  That's not her, right?  Wheel of Fortune!  Oh, I'm touching my nipples.  He's yucky.  Stop.  Get me an olden woman.  Stop.  Say him.  Stop.  Can I have an N?  Like, can I have a vowel?  Yes, an I?  Jimmy, what's up with the nipple thing?  I never got the nipple plug.  I don't know, dude, but that's not how they cast my stuff.  I never got it.  It's just slightly touching.  For me, they're in a rodent of his own, Gregory. 
[03:10:00]  Can we do this?  I'll show you.  Yeah, there you go.  What does that do?  No, you're twisting them like the radio knobs.  I just lightly brush them and just think.  What does that do?  It just.  Ow.  Hoo-ly-hoo.  No.  Toodly-dee-toodly.  Is that like your nipples tweaked in?  Is that Vanna?  Yeah, yeah, she went naked.  Wow.  Yeah, she went naked.  She has a nice, hairy.  That's a lot of times.  Yeah, that's a hairy box.  What's up with the nipple play?  You like that ant?  I don't like playing with my own nipples. 
[03:10:30]  I don't like.  The girl's playing with your nipples.  Not if it's a, like, hey, I'm going to play with your nipples thing.  If she happens to be working her way down somewhere and wants to fiddle around on the trip, yeah, that's fine.  Wants to fiddle around on the trip.  Very sexually fiddle about.  I'm a hopeless romantic.  You really are.  You want to fiddle about on the trip?  Fiddle about.  Fiddle about.  How long is the?  Oh, all right.  It's 82.  Yeah, she's been at it 30 years. 
[03:11:00]  Wow.  Type in.  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut once again doing Sam's job.  Oh, I like that she's here.  Type in octogenarian tits.  Octogenarian.  Octo.  I always say octo.  Octomom.  Octogenarian.  Yeah.  I like pronouncing that.  Stop it.  Feels good that way.  This is.  Oh, man.  Nothing.  Let me see how you spelled it.  I'll smash you.  Yep.  You spelled it right.  You didn't get. 
[03:11:30]  No, it's nothing.  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut.  No, go to page two.  I'm glad he has.  Why are we giving up on this?  There's nothing but like, it's not even a naked woman.  This is page four now.  Don't even see anything.  All right, go to page six.  What are you even talking about?  Let's go to page seven.  It's only six.  Go to page 1,647.  You probably spelled them wrong.  Go down.  Spell octa.  O-C-T-A.  Go try that one.  If that comes up, I'll throw a rock at you.  Octogenarian.  Octo.  Octo.  Okay, don't yell at me.  I'm just asking. 
[03:12:00]  I'm asking questions.  Let's go.  There's nothing there.  All right.  Kevin from Connecticut is a douche.  Is someone actually saying, look up racist wheel of fortune?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They always have had that.  We've done that.  We've done that.  Everyone's done that.  I know.  Please.  Do you see what happens when Kevin from Connecticut does my job?  I thought it was terrific.  Oh, man.  Everything comes to a screeching halt.  I thought it was terrific.  You fucked that up.  I felt like I was on the road to Hana. 
[03:12:30]  80-year-old tits.  That's what someone's saying.  Right.  Put 80-year-old tits in.  That I'll do.  All right.  We got it?  Nice.  Now we're talking.  What is that?  Edgar.  You like that?  You like that?  It's on crazyshit.com.  Yes, I do.  That's horrendous.  She has nice breasts.  Oh, they are not.  I want to hold them.  See, he likes it because her nipples are so long, he can just rub them on his dry teeth. 
[03:13:00]  That looks like raw calamari.  Before they hack them up into the fucking little rings.  Just like empty socks.  Her tits are like squid.  They're like squid.  Squid, right.  All right.  Man, that's terrible.  Yeah.  Vanna touches the letters, but her touch doesn't activate them.  She does nothing.  I like the fact they kind of left her, though, because she's just a part of the show.  Oh, yeah.  She made that show.  Yeah, that's who everyone would talk to.  It was hot Vanna White. 
[03:13:30]  Remember when she would actually do a headstand and turn the letters with her cunt lips?  I thought those were the days.  Vanna White was on Price is Right.  Can we find that video?  Oh, yeah.  She was one of the models.  And someone is going, holy shitballs.  Larry from Connecticut.  Was she on Price is Right?  Let's see, man.  I hate Jane Seymour now.  Someone else said on Reddit about Jane Seymour.  Where the fuck was that?  Ope.  Nick in Philly.  I read a post on Reddit by a guy that claimed that Jane Seymour was the rudest, most difficult  celebrity he has ever met.  He had to convince her that he wasn't going to sell her autograph. 
[03:14:00]  That is a problem.  As if it would be worth anything.  No one gives a fuck about Jane Seymour.  Wait, do I have a picture with her?  Oh, probably not.  Probably not.  She's a jerk.  No, from here, I think I do.  Oh, you do?  She was here?  I would remind her of the time.  That would be perfect.  I would certainly remind her of the time in the elevator.  What year is this?  Whoa, that is Vanna White.  What year?  Just like the monitors here.  They're just like television sets. 
[03:14:30]  When Vanna was invited to come on down, one of them read her t-shirt.  Oh, wow.  Wow, she's a guest.  Oh, man.  I thought she was like a model.  She was a little California girl.  Wow, yeah.  She's pretty hot right there.  Very dirty blonde hair.  What are they saying about her?  Where it says, get serious.  And he said, I am.  I am.  I am.  I thought you'd like to know that.  Now, I thought you would like to know that this is the first item up for bids and the  price is right.  How come we didn't see a run down the stairs? 
[03:15:00]  It's your exercise equipment.  That's when I was staying home to school these times.  Oh, wow.  Look at this exercise equipment.  It's a swim superstar exercise.  Bench, barbells, and dumbbells, all designed to get you in shape and to keep you there.  All right, I'll leave them alone.  That's a formal weight set.  I don't know what do you bid on that.  Oh, Vada.  In the runner.  $500.  Oh, no.  $600.  I'll bet my tits and pussy, Bob.  Oh, man.  For you, Bertha.  What do you bid, Bertha?  Bertha.  Big fat black girl, Bertha. 
[03:15:30]  $350.  Richard.  $625.  $625.  $625.  And Michelle.  $700.  Rape victim.  $700.  The actual retail price.  Plus the $600, right?  That price is $509.  Hey.  Hey, got Bertha.  Good old Bertha.  Bertha wants some gym equipment.  Good luck.  Oh, boy.  Good old Bertha.  Oh, Vada didn't do well.  She gets too high.  She's stupid.  Yep.  And then she went over there and started spinning letters like nobody's business, and then  we'll see.  Looking pretty hot.  She was pretty hot, right? 
[03:16:00]  Hey, Bob Barker gently holds the microphone.  Yes.  That long stick.  And always drawing out the words.  Yeah.  You do that whole thing.  Yeah.  There was a parody called, Hey, Vana, Pick Me a Letter.  Oh, God.  Oh, yuck.  Remember the big thing was, What's Vana Wearing?  Ooh.  Yeah.  Tune in tonight and see what Vana'll be wearing.  I don't remember that.  Oh, yeah.  And she would come out, Vana White, and then she'd do a little spin.  Yeah, it was a big deal.  Big deal.  Go for a video for 2012 or so of that show. 
[03:16:30]  I want to see what she does now.  Who wants to guess, as long as living in Boston, how much Vana is worth?  I'm going to assume this guy looked it up.  I'm going to assume this is correct.  It's got to be $5 million.  How much do you think Vana White's net worth is?  I would say $28. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, man, you're way off.  Ah.  $10 million?  I want to go with $75 for turning fucking letters.  $75 million?  Nah, she must have fucking done that.  She probably has an executive producer credit or deal, or maybe she was a co-creator of  the show.  Wow.  Pat Sajak looks the same.  Yeah, Pat Sajak really, yeah.  He's had.  What a great gig he's had.  Just fucking around with that dumb show.  He-loo-doo.  He-loo-doo.  I'll take an E, an I, an R, two X's, and a Z. 
[03:17:30]  He-loo-doo.  How come that sounded like it?  Oh, that's so funny.  I guess they still have them, right?  He-loo-doo.  He's got $2,000.  He'll be spinning the wheel in just a moment.  Mr. Thornton would like to speak first, however.  I'll do that for you, Pat.  I'll do that for you, Pat.  I'll do that for you, Pat.  I'll take a look at the bays.  That's funny, Jimmy.  He-loo-doo. 
[03:18:00]  He-loo-doo.  R's.  R's, yeah.  Three R's.  Three R's.  Read and write in arithmetic.  Oh.  Okay.  Where am I a vowel?  She just walks by and touches it with her big tits.  There's one E.  Where is that?  One E.  She's not even doing anything.  Three R's.  S.  S, she says, and there's one S.  Oh, that's Z.  Why?  Z-bra.  And it came out recently, they used to drink and shit between tapings. 
[03:18:30]  Of course.  Of course.  What else do they have to do?  She's just touching letters.  Fuck.  That's all she does.  Can I...  For years.  Can I borrow...  Borrow...  Borrow your...  Four dollars.  Can I borrow...  Four...  And I...  Can I borrow...  Can I borrow your niceness?  I love to load out niceness, Gregory.  Have some niceness, Samuel.  It could be, can I borrow your...  Your ends. 
[03:19:00]  Oh.  Can I borrow your nipples?  Can I borrow your...  Niece.  Nose.  Your noses.  Can I borrow your noises?  Your...  Can I borrow your...  Oh, I got it.  Got it.  All right.  Jesus.  She's so stupid.  Noses?  No.  That's dumb.  Can I borrow your notes?  Your nobes.  Notes.  Your notes, because it's the college one, so...  Yeah, notes.  Oh, and no one borrows anyone's notes.  You say, could you email me? 
[03:19:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Or I say, hey, I'm cheating, dork, or take this knuckle sandwich.  Ooh.  Because I was a bully.  Tell him.  You do know Vanna White was in Playboy.  She was.  Yeah.  Before that, right?  You knew Sam, and you're not putting those pictures on her?  Well, I wouldn't.  You just saw that.  I didn't see those.  Well, you should be paying attention.  That was another picture, I thought.  That was from the Playboy issue?  Mm-hmm.  That's what she was naked in, yeah.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Son of a bitch.  Jesus Christ.  I thought I had you.  That's a massive audience.  She was naked in the pictures.  Yeah, what the fuck?  I thought I had this.  Where is this?  No, this must have been at some special event. 
[03:20:00]  College.  Holy do!  Holy do!  There was a fucking thousand people there.  Yeah, it was big.  Holy do-do!  That's so annoying.  I know it is.  I love it.  It's great.  It sounds like the sound, yeah.  Okay, spitting the wheel.  Ho-do-do-do!  I just wanted to get stuck in people's heads.  It is.  Larry from Connecticut is really...  Larry!  He's working hard for us today. 
[03:20:30]  He's come up with some good shit.  Google Wheel of Fortune Chime.  That's what Jimmy is...  Ho-do-do-do!  ...is imitating.  Wheel of Fortune Chime.  Chime.  Chime.  Chime.  Now I need to hear it.  Yeah.  Well, you just did.  Yeah.  A few times.  Ho-do-do-do!  Ho-do-do!  Ho-do-do-do!  Ho-do-do-do!  Ho-do-do-do!  Ho-do-do-do! 
[03:21:00]  So stupid.  All right, no more.  Ho-do-do-do!  No more, right?  No, I can't stop.  All right.  No more.  No more.  Ho-do-do!  Ho-do-do!  No.  Ho-do-do-do!  I'm so fucking retarded.  Ho-do-do-do!  It's a fucking exact replica.  It really is.  I'm done doing it. 
[03:21:30]  You sure?  Ho-do-do-do!  You sure?  Yeah.  You've been doing it a thousand times.  Let's go home.  It is...  What time?  Oh, we have five minutes to complete our contractual obligations to this great company.  Company.  Oh, no.  Ho-do-do-do!  I just tense up and...  I'm trying to drink my water.  Go ahead.  Ho-do-do-do!  It squeezes.  It squeezes his water bottle.  It's like my whole body, my thighs tense up.  My asshole pushes.  You're very good. 
[03:22:00]  Ho-do-do-do!  I drop things.  I guess Michael Duncan-Clark died of natural causes.  Heart attack, yeah.  Is that a natural cause?  A heart attack, officially?  Yeah.  I guess.  He had it in, like, July.  54.  He hung around for a little while.  He's a nice guy.  He was great.  I don't know if we talked about it yesterday.  We only met him once.  Relatively recently, too.  And he was here with Amorosa.  Yeah.  We kind of busted that thing wide open.  They were keeping it on the QT.  He was so nice, man. 
[03:22:30]  That guy was so fucking nice.  And that's what everyone's saying about him.  Joe Rogan knew him pretty well, and he said the same fucking thing.  Yeah, he was a nice man.  Loved the UFC.  Just loved being alive.  Just one of those happy-go-lucky guys.  Man, we interviewed him.  Really, really nice dude, man.  I'd like some of that calm bread, your wife, man.  Why'd he get nominated for that?  They always nominate black guys for weird roles.  Yeah.  You didn't think he was good in that?  He was good, but I mean, I don't remember.  Well, who was he up against? 
[03:23:00]  I think he was great then.  Was it Oscar-worthy, though?  Maybe it was.  Especially when you saw the other stuff he was in afterwards.  I thought he was pretty goddamn good in that.  Yeah, I think so, too, man.  Did you see a clip of that, Sam, if you could find it?  The Green Mill?  Who was he nominated with?  Yeah.  He didn't win.  He was nominated.  The Green Mill.  I'll send him a little video.  And...  What's your call for?  I like the drink.  All right.  Only not.  Spilled the same.  Really?  Oh, you know what?  I guess he couldn't get them bugs out of his mouth. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Remember Jim McKay?  Yes.  40 years ago today.  With the Israelis at the Olympics?  Yeah.  And how he announced that they replayed it on MSNBC this morning?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Can we play that before we do, too?  Yeah, what did he say?  Hey, I don't want to give it away, but just how he said it.  Was it like...  I think his quote was, and then we could play it anyway, he goes, they're all gone. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, wow.  It was so fucking dramatic how he was announcing to the world that all these athletes died.  Oh, that's after they took it at the airport, right?  And they're all gone.  Yeah, that was 40 years ago.  Oh, boy.  I don't remember that.  He got a lot younger.  72 Olympics.  Munich.  Hmm.  And then Mossad has hunted those guys all down.  Oh, hilarious, right?  I love the Israeli Mossad.  They don't have them all.  They got them all?  Well, most of them were all of them.  Oh, that's what the movie was based on, right?  What was the movie?  I never saw it, but wasn't that what it was based on? 
[03:24:30]  I don't know.  I just saw that one.  Them hunting them down?  Yeah.  One by one?  The latest word we get...  Is this it?  Yeah.  Is this a long clip?  Oh, no.  That quote, all hell is broken loose out there.  That there was still shooting going on.  That there was a report of a burning helicopter.  And the worst words I ever heard in my ear was that he said, Jim, we've finally gotten clearance to put it on the air.  When I was a kid, my father used to say, our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized. 
[03:25:00]  Our worst fears have been realized tonight.  They've now said that there were 11 hostages.  Two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning.  Nine were killed at the airport tonight.  They're all gone.  Oh.  Wow.  I just got chills.  No, why?  Because, you know, he wasn't a news guy.  And he had to like...  No, he's like a sports guy.  Yeah, and he had to be a news guy that night.  They're all gone.  Who actually... 
[03:25:30]  What shitty fucking group did that?  Who killed them in the...  Fire of Terrorists.  Oh, definitely.  I mean, was it...  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what group, but...  I don't know.  Killing Olympians.  I met...  Shitty countries.  I met Jim McKay when I was working at CMF in Rochester.  Palestinians, of course.  Oh.  He was a short little guy.  Was he?  He did look like a little guy.  It was the Palestinians.  They had the U.S. Open in Rochester and hung out.  I hung out with all the ABC guys.  We were all drinking every night.  Yeah, they all drink. 
[03:26:00]  Broadcast people.  And I got to meet Jim McKay.  I was like, holy fuck.  Jim fucking McKay.  No one knows who he is nowadays, but...  He was huge.  Yeah.  He was a great sports announcer, too.  Jimmy's looking up the...  tracked down and killed by Israeli intelligence and special forces.  They killed one of those in Norway and four passerbys in Lebanon.  They...  I guess they got all of them, because they had captured three of them, and then, of course,  they hijacked a plane, Lufthansa, so they let them go to release the fucking passengers. 
[03:26:30]  Remember when we said that Vanna White's net worth was $75 million?  Yeah.  Why would that be right?  Of course it's not.  What is it?  This guy really fucking pissed.  Craig Applegate's like, dude, every fucking site says $15 million.  Oh, boy.  That's a little different, no?  Just a little.  Her net's worth...  Why is a net worth so much money?  Is it a net of gold?  That was a good delivery, Chip. 
[03:27:00]  That was really good.  Instead of gold?  Gold?  That's a good fucking question.  That is a good question.  I give a fuck.  They're all gone.  I don't give a fuck.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That's it, I guess, right?  Man.  I guess I'll be watching more of the Democratic National Convention this evening.  Live tweeting it?  Yeah, live tweeting, of course.  Yeah.  Got to see Bill Clinton's speech. 
[03:27:30]  A lot of people speculating, Bill Clinton, not a big fan of the Obamas.  I think over the years we've seen that there hasn't been a great interaction between the  two camps.  And he was quoted as saying what to Ted Kennedy?  That came out over the weekend.  I never heard that before, but I guess it was.  He looked like he had a couple of years.  A couple of years ago, he'd be carrying our bags.  Yes.  I think Teddy laughed and fucking did a shot and poured out his ear.  There's nothing in his head.  It's absolutely in a way with the cancer.  I got it. 
[03:28:00]  I understand.  I love when you say, I've got it.  Don't play sources say he absolutely said that to Ted Kennedy.  So what other people are saying is, what they're saying, reports that I'm hearing, that he  did not submit his speech to the Obama camp.  He's saying, you know, I'm fucking one of the ex-presidents.  I'm Bill Clinton.  Wow.  Can you imagine he just blows up his spot?  He doesn't need to submit his speech.  He's a fucking asshole. 
[03:28:30]  I guess he said that to Ted Kennedy, just to give you the complete story, because, you  know, Bill goes to Ted, like, I need your support for Hillary.  That's interesting.  Hey, by the way, Ted Kennedy last night, they did a little tribute to him in film.  And it was all about ripping Romney, pretty much.  They were showing Ted Kennedy debating Romney, Ted Kennedy commenting on Romney.  Did they show the Chappaquiddick?  No, of course not.  Which was the big thing.  Last night's theme of the convention was pretty much women respecting women and including 
[03:29:00]  them and equal pay and just all that, letting women be in charge of their bodies.  And then they pay tribute to Kennedy, who's from a family that did nothing but fuck and  kill women.  And they don't, it's odd that they don't show the Chappaquiddick, which was a disgraceful.  It's not odd that they didn't show it.  I guess, I mean, you're right.  It would have been odd if they did it.  It's so strange.  Yeah, that's a good point.  I understand what you're trying to say.  No, you're right. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  It was Black September, the Palestinian group that did the hostage thing in the Olympics.  It's a song about a thick puppy.  Black September?  Yeah.  How's it go?  Black September gets into Black November.  Black December.  White January.  It just goes through the months.  What about October?  Yeah.  You went from Black September to Black November.  I didn't.  Yes, you did.  It's October.  You did not.  You didn't.  It's not even a real song.  You're an idiot.  That's all rock, though.  Why would you go October? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, it was kind of...  It goes Black September.  Orange October.  Black November.  Black December.  White January.  Sex.  That song blows.  You don't think that's good?  It's so bad.  The orange.  You like the orange?  Orange.  Yeah, because of Halloween.  It's funking.  Halloween, yeah.  You didn't like it, Sam?  It's terrible.  What a bad song. 
[03:30:30]  And they all sound the same.  They all.  Yeah, it's fucking metal, motherfucker.  Fucking.  All right, look.  You have fun.  I can't listen to any more of this shit.  And that's what the audience is saying.  All right, everybody.  Wait, look at this joke.  Take a look.  I put my thing on wrong.  Where is everybody?  Ah, the hoodie's on backwards.  The hood's over your face, Chip.  Thanks for giving it away.  Oh, sorry.  That was a good one, though.  Look.  Get the fuck out of here.  Everyone have a pleasant day.  All right, let's go.  And we'll see you tomorrow. 
[03:31:00]  Will we?  Thank you.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers.  Because where it's cold, there's the ice road truckers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  What can't I be on tree? 
[03:31:30]  Serious XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  This is CM Punk, and you're listening to After Opie and Anthony Live with Sam Roberts.  Yeah, pipe bomb.  I wasn't expecting that.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  What a nice treat.  What brought that along today? 
[03:32:00]  You can't predict what CM Punk does.  Yeah, right.  He is the most unpredictable entertainer in all of entertainment.  Best in the world.  That's right.  He's the best in the world at cutting liners.  Who's better?  Not the Iron Sheik.  Not Jimmy Snuka.  They both fuck everything up.  Macho Man?  Macho Man's pretty good.  Want to hear of Macho Man?  I would.  Yeah, you're listening to After Opie and Anthony Live.  With the primetime kid himself, Sam Roberts. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, dig it.  One day we'll collect enough of those that we could just spend the whole show listening  to people saying, reminding you.  I always, I never understood liners.  Like, even when I was a kid.  Because all radio stations get people to come in and do the liners.  But you listen.  Like, I guess I get it here.  Because generally, you guys listen, who listen to this channel, listen to the show a lot.  So you hear the liners and you kind of remember when they were in studio or whatever.  But, like, the top 40 stations and stuff that get liners? 
[03:33:00]  Like, you know, you hear Justin Timberlake and whoever, Rihanna, advertising every single  top 40 station wherever you live.  Well.  You hear those pop stars, but you've never heard them on the channel.  Yeah.  Do they just go in and cut liners for every station that the property owns?  Well, it's a couple of things.  One, it would do it for profile, like in New York, L.A., some of the bigger markets.  Wait, but it's profile.  Like, if Z100 here in New York got, like you said, Rihanna, Katy Perry, whatever, they 
[03:33:30]  record those liners because other stations in New York don't get those people.  Right, okay.  But that doesn't really happen anymore.  I mean, does it?  Yes and no.  There's big artists that will do New York, L.A., maybe D.C., Miami, but they're not doing,  you know, Idaho and Montana and stuff.  But with radio, it's not like anybody in Idaho listens to the New York station and it's  like, whoa, New York, that's pretty special.  It's just how it's always been done.  A lot of stuff in radio is like that.  It's just how it's always been done.  Like, nobody actually thinks, is this still relevant to this medium in 2012? 
[03:34:00]  And you can tell what pop stars were on what station and what weren't, because Clear Channel  does this a lot, where here in New York or in L.A. on KISS, they get all that big talent  that comes in.  Right.  They'll record IDs, but then they'll recut those IDs that say, you're listening to Z100  or KISS FM, and then just give the generics out to their top 40 stations in smaller markets.  Right.  So you'll hear montages like, hi, this is Christina.  Yeah.  Hey, this is Justin Timberlake. 
[03:34:30]  Hey, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But then you hear the voice guy say like...  The station, the call letters.  Yeah, like Mix 102, whatever, but you never hear the artists say it.  What's Wendy Williams doing out there?  Tell her to come in.  Stop by.  I used to listen to Wendy Williams on the radio all the time.  I'm sorry.  She's a big dude.  It's a female, Eric.  It's not a dude.  What do you mean you're sorry?  Have you ever heard her...  Did you ever listen to her radio show?  Listen, you can say what you want about her TV show.  It is oriented more towards females.  Her radio show?  No, her TV show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's pretty successful. 
[03:35:00]  I didn't know if it was still long.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's very successful.  But her radio show was awesome.  Was it?  Yeah, it was actually really good.  It was early in the afternoon, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I used to listen to it.  Although, the one...  I remember listening to Wendy Williams once, and I wish I was running tape on it, because  I couldn't...  I guess you can't really download her show anywhere.  But I remember listening to it one day, and it was the day after the Imus thing, when  Imus called the whatever basketball team nappy-headed hoes.  It was the day after that.  So everybody was talking about it, and obviously Wendy Williams was talking about that. 
[03:35:30]  And I was just driving around, and I hear some caller...  This is when Opie and Anthony was still on K-Rock, and so it was kind of, you know, all  the New York people were listening and whatever.  So a caller calls into Wendy Williams, and Wendy's, you know, because Wendy hasn't really  taken a stance on it yet.  And the caller goes, yeah, you know, Imus, this guy, he's not even sorry.  And Wendy's like, well, how do you know that?  And he goes, well, I heard Imus on Opie and Anthony this morning, and he wasn't... 
[03:36:00]  He was saying all kinds of crazy stuff on that show.  He wasn't sorry at all.  And he was going on and on.  And I'm just cracking up in my car, because nobody realizes that it's Ant doing Imus.  It's not actually Don Imus coming on Opie and Anthony and being extraordinarily racist.  It's Anthony doing a voice.  But that was...  I wish I had been running tape on that, because we would have played that clip forever.  However, 866-WOW1-WOW, call me up and tell me what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony 
[03:36:30]  show.  She'll probably be down in 10 minutes.  If she wants to...  Yeah, yeah.  If she wants to stop by.  Although, I think she's only doing, like, gay, hip-hop, and women's stuff.  But she's doing the OutCue...  What's...  She's doing OutCue, Cosmo, and, like, the hip-hop...  I'm sure it's House Tattoo.  And see, what do you think that is?  Gay, feminine, or black?  Just confusing.  A little vicarious, maybe?  Did you learn anything on the show today, Roland?  I learned that Sal got a semi-beating.  Sal, it was a rough day for you today, was it not? 
[03:37:00]  Sorry.  Well, they've been coming more and more towards you.  I mean, the beatings.  But he didn't have to go to Gary's office to call him the wizard, though.  No.  Yeah, that one.  How do you feel about the rash of criticism that's been coming your way lately in terms  of you being better when you were an intern, talks of you being replaced?  I don't know who brought that up today.  Yeah, who would do that?  What do you think of the sort of, the theory or whatever, the opinion of you is that you 
[03:37:30]  were better as an intern?  It's just the nature of what happens, I guess, when you become a staff member.  No, I mean, nobody has ever been like, man, Sam, you were better.  You know what's always happened?  Everybody's like, every day of my life, they're like, man, Sam, you're a little bit better than  you were yesterday.  You just keep improving.  It's great.  Everybody, my wife, my cat, whoever, I mean, everybody, my mom, she texts me, great show  today.  I didn't think it could get better than yesterday, but it was great today. 
[03:38:00]  So, I mean, I hear it all the time.  It's fine.  I understand I'm going to get beatings throughout.  You know, everyone else gets beatings here, so.  Are there elements of truth in the beatings?  Do you look for that?  Yeah, of course.  And improvements that you can make?  Yeah, of course.  What do you think you can improve?  I don't know.  Just, I don't know, put out a little more work, maybe?  That's right.  It's about going above and beyond.  That's something you don't do anymore.  Do you think that's incorrect? 
[03:38:30]  No.  Did I say that?  No.  I do work hard.  Eric, he left early yesterday, right?  No, I didn't.  Did he leave?  He left before 2 o'clock.  Can you do some protest?  He's a hipster.  That's what you're saying.  He left a little early yesterday, right?  Yeah, he left before we did, yeah.  Okay, so you leave a little early, come in a little late, you know.  I'm coming late.  I come on early every day.  Well, whatever.  I don't know what time you get here.  Dan in Wyoming.  I just start rumors. 
[03:39:00]  I learned that normal kids are called typicals by the parents of trainables.  Well, I don't know.  Trainables.  Thank you, Dan.  Yeah, typical is the word.  Instead of saying normal, you say typical.  That was a good one.  But what about you, Andrew in Louisiana?  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  It's Joker.  Joker!  I got trouble getting through because your buddy Sal there has a personal vendetta  and hangs up on me every time he answers the phone.  Why do you hang up on the Joker? 
[03:39:30]  I don't know.  What did you have to say today, Joker?  It wasn't today, buddy.  It's been every day before.  Every day.  I call in yesterday to the main show, have probably the best story for that ridiculous  segment on the football garbage.  The fantasy football.  You hung up on me two or three times and then just put me on hold and said, yeah, sit there.  Well, if you're on hold, that means your call was screened.  Therefore, Opie can see it.  Why'd you hang up on him three times? 
[03:40:00]  Because it probably sucked three times.  His story probably wasn't good.  Yeah, it probably wasn't very good.  I like the Joker.  He has good stories.  He's always good, right?  He's always good for a story.  I see the Joker on the screen.  I go, I think I'm going to get a good story today out of this guy.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam, what I really call for is you can actually be jonesing for the Sam Roberts show,  the after show, whichever show you're doing.  Is that right?  Absolutely.  I've missed you.  I don't know what it is, Sam.  So people, it drives people nuts.  I've been hearing that more and more. 
[03:40:30]  Like, they're like, you know what?  I'd really like to be happy that you're gone.  And I would love to be sitting here hating you.  But there's something, you've infected my brain.  Is this from your mom again?  Yeah.  I mean, she was like, I used to not like you at all.  You used to be terrible.  But there's something about you, Sam, my little sweetie baby, that you're really good now.  And I go, thanks, Mom.  Thank you very much for the compliment.  All right.  Take care, buddy.  Thanks, Joe.  Kiss my ass.  I would love to.  It's coming from all directions. 
[03:41:00]  It's coming from all directions, Sal.  What are you going to do to get a step out of the way of this?  I don't know.  Just come up with some idea, some sort of a bit.  Yeah.  That's what our old intern Kevi said.  That's true.  Yeah.  Kevi had a problem.  If you remember intern Kevi, you probably don't.  He had a problem that we told him at the beginning of the semester to come up with an idea.  And then at the end of the semester, he informed us that he had tried to, but he had not been able to come up with a single idea in a full semester. 
[03:41:30]  Is that going to happen with you, maybe?  No.  I'm going to check in with you in like three weeks, and you're like, I'm trying.  I'm working on it.  I've been thinking, but no ideas come.  No.  I have a slightly greater mental capacity than Uncle Kevi.  And I don't know if ideas are your strong suit either.  Because last time, you came up with an idea.  Eric, do you have on deck the last time Sal came up with an idea?  Don't get the panda angry! 
[03:42:00]  So you can see.  It's horrendous.  Oh, the line is still going.  Yeah, the line's still going.  Why was the line hanging out with the panda?  Oh, there I go.  Sorry, Eric.  Why was the line hanging out with the panda that day?  It's just a...  Is that a zoo?  A major affair at the zoo, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, that's why I think, uh, I don't know.  Maybe ideas are not your strong suit.  Maybe we go in another direction.  Well, I've come up with other ideas and other bits since then that have gone on that have been much better than that.  Well, I mean, it's not all bad feedback.  Kevin in Houston, you have a comment about Sal?  Yeah, man. 
[03:42:30]  How long have y'all been on XM now?  Since 2005?  Oh, 2004.  October 2004.  Eight years I've been a listener.  Mm-hmm.  Back when it was, when we had to pay $1.99.  Wow.  Listen to the virus.  Mm-hmm.  Or back then it was, uh, what was it?  High voltage.  Oh, yeah.  Sal doesn't even know that.  I did know that.  And I knew actually it was 04, you fucking idiot.  So why don't you just hang up?  Go fucking eat a dick, son of a shit.  You're a fucking terrible phone screener.  Wow.  You're not funny.  And you add zero to the show. 
[03:43:00]  Oh.  Did you hear what he said?  I mean, what, what, it's a caller.  Would you have put this call through?  Would I have put it through?  I would have put it up.  Did you not hear me the first time?  By the way.  You add zero to the show.  I heard you the first time.  It's fine.  What was that?  I couldn't hear him.  Did you not hear him, Roland?  Uh, Kevin, Roland didn't hear you.  Oh, hang on a minute.  Did it sucker?  Or did you add zero to the show?  Oh.  He's talking to Sal Roland, not you.  Confusing pronouns.  He's funny.  Um, well, what say you to Kevin then, Sal? 
[03:43:30]  I, he's, he's a, someone who's calling into, uh, a radio show.  He's trying to engage himself with me.  Listen, Sal.  I work in my car all day, so I listen to the radio, and then I listen to Ron and Seth.  Plus, there's nothing wrong with people who call in.  These are the guys who pay our salaries.  Am I right, Kevin?  Absolutely.  I pay, I paid a lifetime subscription.  Lifetime, baby.  Good.  Then, thank you very much for listening, and I hope you're getting some, uh, joy out of  making this phone call.  Hang up.  And keep listening. 
[03:44:00]  You have to still listen, don't you?  No, well, because I'm gonna be happy when I get to hear it on the replay, and then I'll  be like, look, I was on the radio today, and I'll be, like, all excited.  Good.  All right.  That's fantastic.  All right, Kevin, I'll talk to you later.  All right, talk to you now, boys.  Bye.  He got you on that one.  Oh, he beat me.  Oh, he did.  You're not good with comebacks.  He's, he's just, he's just a nobody.  You're not a-  He's like a Dr. Phil with comebacks.  Jesus Christ.  How is Dr. Phil not good?  I don't watch Dr. Phil's show.  No, it's like a, it's like a long-winded.  Yeah, and you're like, where is he going with this?  Don't look back in your life. 
[03:44:30]  Shut up.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Here's what you do.  Fuck you.  Fuck you back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how you do it.  That's so much better, yeah.  It is.  Do you, uh, I, yeah, I, you're not, like, a quick wordsmith type guy.  No.  No, you're not quick on your feet.  Remember when Mark Zito just fucking laid you out?  Destroyed my ass, yeah.  Yeah.  It's gotta be rough.  It's gotta be rough to walk in here knowing that it's, it's gonna, you're gonna lose.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, when you, do you know that when you walk in?  Oh, yeah.  Like, you're like, oh, cause like me, I'm fighting to the death. 
[03:45:00]  And we're gonna go.  Like, I can't guarantee victory, but I'll guarantee we're gonna, we're gonna scrap.  Yeah, when I came in today, I knew I was done.  You did?  Oh, yeah, I was like, I'm going in just to talk.  Well, don't you think that that would be a losing attitude?  Isn't that, isn't that problem number one right there?  I think I just need more time in that environment to get better at it, you know?  You gotta go in and be like, I'm gonna fucking lay everybody out right now.  I walk in, what atomic bombs can I set off and ruin people's lives?  Well, yeah, I mean, that's why nobody pushes Roland to that extent, because Roland doesn't 
[03:45:30]  see the problem with ruining somebody's personal life because they said he was stupid or something  like that, you know?  By the way, Roland, I saw some interesting photos of you over the weekend while I was,  I was still in Hawaii.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, I wasn't cheap when I was in Hawaii.  It was a relaxing vacation.  We weren't there to do tourist activities.  We were there to relax.  Real quick, Mark in Texas wants to chime in with something.  Mark.  Yeah. 
[03:46:00]  What did you want to say?  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Yeah, hey, is Sal, is he an intern there, or what does he do there?  No, Sal used to be an intern, and he now is an employee, his official title is associate  producer, and he has now started screening the calls, and he's, like, Eroch, are you  the assistant boss of the interns?  I've been watching you with the interns.  I do a fair amount of training.  Eroch, would you consider Sal your personal assistant?  No.  I would.  He's a Dwight Shrew.  He hasn't earned that title yet.  He's Dwight Shrew, and Eric is, like, the boss, I see. 
[03:46:30]  Dwight Shrew.  It's Shrew, too.  There's a T at the end there.  It doesn't matter.  Consonants are not Roland's strong suit.  Yeah, like, so Sal is like, yeah, I'm the assistant manager, and Eric's over there going  assistant to the manager, Sal.  Don't you forget it.  Sal's pretty much your, like, your assistant.  Eric?  That's a funny analogy, but no.  He's working on it, though?  Why is he not your assistant?  Because he doesn't have that title, and I work with Sal.  Sal. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  You see yourself more of his assistant in the sense that you don't see Eric working  with you.  He assigns you things, and then you have to do them.  Absolutely.  Okay, so, Eric, it's not, you can, you're allowed to be the boss here.  Sure.  You know, like, I take on personal assistants out of nowhere.  Like, I just grab interns and be like, you're my new personal assistant.  And give them belts and...  Right.  Like, you just do it.  You don't have to wait until, like, you can give someone a title, and if they acknowledge  it, you just did it.  Okay.  What do you, what is anybody going to stop you?  I never asked him.  I think, you don't have to ask.  You could just assign it. 
[03:47:30]  Like, I've never said, hey, would you like to do this?  You just do it.  So, you could right now say, Sal, you are my personal assistant.  No, no, no, no.  Not your personal assistant.  No, no, no.  Why?  Assistant with show-related things.  No, no, no.  Personal assistant.  No, no, no.  Personal assistant, no.  Eric needs a personal assistant, Sal.  This is what I was talking about going above and beyond.  Not show-related things.  I'm going to get further in the company and in the show by assisting Eric.  Yes.  No, that's ridiculous.  Yes, you will.  That's what Mark Zito did.  Yes.  Mark Zito used to be Eric Nagel's personal assistant.  Not a lot of people know that, but for a year, Mark Zito was behind the scenes Eric Nagel's 
[03:48:00]  personal assistant, and then he went on to do great things.  I don't know exactly what they are, but he's doing them.  He's still here.  He's still here doing something.  Now, Sal.  Six photos of girls at raves.  Right.  I thought that was Opie.  No, Mark does that too.  Now, Sal, you have an opportunity at your feet.  Obviously, ideas, not where you're good.  Phone screening, definitely not the best.  Comebacks?  Comebacks, you're right, Roland.  Horrible.  Maybe your calling in life is personal assisting. 
[03:48:30]  No, definitely not.  Why?  What's wrong with that?  Especially not Eric.  Why?  What's wrong with being Eric?  Will you be Eric's executive assistant then?  What's the difference between the two then?  You'd have to ask Eric.  Eric?  Eric, you need to ask.  Eric, you need an executive.  You need some kind of assistant.  Eric needs somebody to make him drinks at home.  That's what I'm saying.  Somebody to make him drinks, lunch reservations.  Like, next time we do a live gig.  Like, if we were going back to Chicago or something, you would book Eric's travel for him. 
[03:49:00]  Stuff like that.  Eric, you see this is all beneficial, correct?  I see it totally beneficial.  To Sal.  Plus, executive assistant gets a belt.  That's true.  I don't want no fucking belt.  I don't want to do your personal stuff.  If you want help, Sal doesn't want the belt.  He doesn't want the belt.  If you need help with show-related stuff.  He used to want the belt.  He used to want the belt when he was an intern.  Not anymore.  Now he just sits in the back there on his Pro Tools and his Mac and says how better he is at everything else than we are.  Why don't you be Eric's assistant?  No.  Why?  Because that's not my job. 
[03:49:30]  What is your job?  Like, what do you do?  I do many things around you.  You do what Eric tells you.  In a way, yeah.  Right.  All right.  So, why don't you just do it with a little bit of honor and at least be able to say I'm his assistant.  So, of course I'm doing it.  All right.  So, be Eric's personal assistant.  No, I'm not being Eric's assistant.  You have a choice then.  Yeah.  Personal or executive assistant.  I still don't know what the difference is.  Because then Eric gets to pretend he's an executive.  Eric's not an executive.  So, how could you be an executive assistant?  He's a senior producer.  Why does he deserve an assistant in general then?  Because he has a lot on his plate. 
[03:50:00]  If it rains, can Sal hold the umbrella for Eric?  Of course.  Like Farnsworth Bentley did for P. Diddy.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's part of the deal.  I would absolutely for O. Vander, Jim.  Farnsworth got his own career going.  Right.  And now Farnsworth Bentley is like, the shit.  Like, everybody's like, oh, shit.  He's the guy.  Because that's where you've got to start.  Eric is the P. Diddy of...  Sal needs to wear more plaid.  You need more plaid because the boss said so.  Eric is the P. Diddy of the show.  Let's be honest.  Is he?  I think that's something all the listeners...  Or maybe it's Notorious B. I.G.  Yeah, I was going to say, it's probably Biggie. 
[03:50:30]  I can't figure out which one it is.  But, um...  What do you want to do?  Personal assistant or executive assistant?  What do you want to be called?  It's what you are.  So what do you want to be called?  Neither.  It doesn't...  Well, you're going to have to pick one.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to think of something more humiliating.  You are already doing the work.  So this is what you're going to be called from now on.  The listeners at home, they don't understand what your job is.  So...  Call him cocksucker.  Okay, Mark in Texas is thinking cocksucker.  Do you want to be just cocksucker?  No, I'd rather be a fluffer than a cocksucker.  Well, it's going to be cocksucker. 
[03:51:00]  And I don't know why you want to fluff guys so bad, but...  I would want to put my mouth on Eric's dick.  I'd rather just fluff him right before the show starts.  That involves putting a mouth on a dick.  No, just a little, you know...  You would rather give Eric a handjob than a blowjob?  Oh, yeah.  You would?  Yeah, definitely.  Would you give him a handjob?  No.  If you had to?  In terms of what I had to...  What's the alternate?  Nazis rape your family.  And you've got to do it to completion and eat your tongue.  Off your hand, though.  Because Eric just gurgles over. 
[03:51:30]  He's not going to shoot.  Deal?  You don't want Nazis raping your family.  Deal?  No deal.  I'm sorry.  No.  Oh, wow.  To your mother?  Yeah.  Hitler's going to rape your mom.  I'd rather that than touch the needle.  You are Eric's executive assistant.  Fine.  I'll take the executive assistant position.  Mark, what did you want to say to Sal?  Well, I usually listen Wednesday to Friday about this time in the week.  I don't know what Sal does on the weekend, but I think he just needs a little bit more 
[03:52:00]  exposure on the air.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't like him.  I kind of, I don't know.  I like him.  I mean, he's all right.  But maybe he would just kind of get some more exposure on the air.  I think maybe he'd do a lot better and people would like him a little bit more.  So, I mean, whether it's all about what Eric, whether he gave the shit or not, but yeah.  It depends on, thank you, Mark.  It depends on what Eric wants him to do.  If Eric wants him to go on the air, he'll go on the air.  If Eric wants him to do some work behind the scenes.  Right, Eric?  Well, let's see if he's, are you thirsty, Eric?  Yeah, I could go for a drink. 
[03:52:30]  Well, you could send an intern because I'm realized.  But he's got an assistant.  Why would he send an intern?  The interns are busy.  Ben in New Jersey.  Hey, Sam.  It sounds like Sal is the executive intern of the paid staff.  Maybe he needs to do reviews of the staff.  Well, I don't know.  No, because you know what?  Sal is like not retarded enough.  You know what I mean?  I'm not retarded at all.  Well, I mean, I'll stick with my word.  You do scare easy.  Why would that make me retarded?  The only one who pulled that off was David.  Right. 
[03:53:00]  I mean, David was the man.  Jack in Washington.  Hey, Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  The listeners know exactly what Sal's job is.  It's cutting up Brett Pesta for almost five seconds within the first show of the week.  That's right.  That's right.  Sal's job is making promos for the weekend best of when the week of shows has only started  10 minutes ago.  Okay.  That wasn't the case.  I understand.  Let's see.  Jordan, what did you learn on today's show?  Jordan.  Yeah, Sam.  Yeah, buddy. 
[03:53:30]  I learned you didn't do shit in Hawaii.  I did shit.  I relaxed.  You didn't do nothing.  It won't be too long because you absolutely love Anthony because you did.  All right.  Well, listen.  I'll tell you one thing.  I did what I did in Hawaii, but at least I did it with a phone that works.  Jordan.  I'll start.  That's right.  Way to call into a radio show with an embarrassingly bad phone.  I mean, that's just Bush League.  No, he just has AT&T.  I saw some interesting photos of you, Roland.  Troy and I, we wrote down.  Well, apparently you did. 
[03:54:00]  I was in Hawaii.  Eric, did you see these photos of Roland?  Um, if it's the one I'm thinking of at a phone booth.  Well, the first, the day started.  See, Troy should come in.  He was there.  On, on, on Troy or Roland's Instagram.  I don't know.  I was expecting you to just see the same lame New York City sunset photos again and again  and again.  Like last night.  No, I didn't say one last night.  I thought you did.  No, no.  I'm just scrolling through.  And first I see a picture.  I guess they were hanging out.  For those that don't know, Troy and Roland have been hanging out because Roland has a pool 
[03:54:30]  and Troy keeps his bathing suit at Roland's house.  Yeah.  Which is a little romantic for my taste.  Why?  To keep your bathing suit at another man's house.  It's like...  Well, it's convenient.  That way if I'm here at work, I don't have to remember to bring my bathing suit.  I can just go over and swim.  Has he given you a drawer?  I don't know.  Where is it?  It's not part of the day.  He's telling his thing.  You haven't given Troy his own drawer yet?  I don't have drawers.  It's New York.  Who has drawers?  They put like a...  Where do you put your stuff?  Well, in my closet.  They did that California closet thing. 
[03:55:00]  I don't know what a California closet is.  Is it a closet with drawers?  No, it's like little...  They make little cubby holes and all that.  I don't know what goes on.  Sounds like a rom-com.  Yeah, I don't know.  Here's the key.  And then I got you your own drawer.  And Roland's talking, oh, it's New York.  We don't have drawers.  Apparently you have Mickey Mouse themed bathrooms, though, in New York.  What's that?  That's Roland's.  Roland's whole bathroom is decked out in Mickey Mouse.  Who knew he was obsessed with Mickey Mouse?  But you were at Roland's pool over the Memorial Day weekend.  Yeah.  And I was scrolling through these pictures, and the first picture I saw was you up on 
[03:55:30]  Roland's shoulders in a small bathing suit.  Your bathing suit's small.  No, no.  I had him pulled up because I had to hoist myself up on his shoulders, so I had to  pull them up my thighs.  Oh.  Yeah.  They're like board shorts.  They're like, they come down almost to my knees.  Oh, I got you.  I thought it was you.  You had more of a European cut.  No, no, no.  Because, I mean, your thighs were in clear view.  They are.  But like I said, I couldn't get on his shoulders with him, so I had to hike them up.  So you had to hike them up.  Yeah.  The one picture is just him, like, it's as if it's a guy and a girl, really. 
[03:56:00]  It's a...  I don't really see a problem with him.  It's just a couple guys having some fun.  Well, the one problem would be your balls were on the back of Roland's neck.  Ah.  Whatever.  I mean, right?  That's neither here nor there.  Did you feel them, Roland?  Yeah.  You did?  No.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought you might have.  Um, so I guess they go swimming together, you know, put their balls on their necks or  whatever.  No, we were just hanging out.  Yeah.  Frolicking.  You were frolicking together?  Sure.  We were just splashing around.  There you go.  We did.  Right.  There's the picture.  What's your...  Whose Instagram is it on? 
[03:56:30]  That's on Roland's.  But then I retweeted it, but...  And also we did some, uh, synchronized swimming.  Yeah, but you could see where people would, uh, you did synchronized swimming together?  Yeah.  That's just...  Did you synchronize swim?  A little bit.  A little bit.  That's like a gay thing.  No.  Nah.  You don't think synchronized swimming...  Sal, do you think synchronized swimming is a little gay?  No, no.  Eric, we're just throwing down.  Yeah, guys don't do it in the Olympics.  Well, teach your assistant that, you know?  He thinks that synchronized swimming is a heterosexual thing.  It's not.  Um...  So, I mean, what's so gay about that foot? 
[03:57:00]  I mean, it's just two dudes.  It's hanging out, you know what I mean?  You're all smiles.  I mean, the balls on the neck thing.  Yeah, but Roland's wearing a shirt, so that's like an extra layer.  Yeah.  No, but the balls are on his neck.  The shirt's not covering his neck.  It's bunching up on his neck.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, there's no...  You got the skyline in the background.  Isn't that a nice photo?  And plus, your shorts are all hiked up.  It really looks like you're wearing a very small bathing suit.  It does, but...  In that picture, it does.  It does.  Okay.  And that's fine, but...  I'm not.  But it's just like, hey, you know, like, we're bros.  Right, hanging out. 
[03:57:30]  We're hanging out.  Well, you decided to extend the hangout sesh.  Was it a sesh?  Yeah.  Okay.  Then we went to Smorgasburg.  That's our thing.  I know Smorgasburg is your thing.  I've heard it before.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  We went there, then I went back, napped, and we made up to the party.  Well, I guess you guys went to a party or a bar or something, because I'm flipping through  photos, and one minute I see, over the weekend, Roland either is slinging his dick around  more than any of us think he is, or he's got a lot of friends that are photogenic females, 
[03:58:00]  because he had his pictures with several different women throughout the weekend.  Roland's a...  A lot of ladies love Roland.  I mean, he's going...  He's got...  On...  When he's hanging out with you, it's a picture of him and a couple brunettes.  Then he goes to Bruce the next night, and he's got some blonde with him.  No, I know.  Yeah, I know.  He gets around.  No, he's pimping.  He's pimping.  Are you pimping a little bit, Roland?  I don't pimp.  I just...  Ladies love Roland.  Yeah.  They do.  They do.  Well, when we got to the bar, first of all, it was Rob, who's a DJ on Liquid Metal. 
[03:58:30]  Okay.  It was his birthday party.  Okay.  And a couple of the other Liquid Metal people were out there, and were like, oh yeah, let's  go out.  And I literally showed up, and Roland is...  What were you drinking?  Vodka.  He was drinking vodka and soda or something?  A little soda.  It's like a dump bar.  I just put vodka...  I don't know what it was called.  Spritz of soda.  A spritz.  It's that.  Vodka with a Coca-Cola essence.  Yeah.  But he was sucking them down like there was no tomorrow.  You drink a lot of them alone?  He would suck them down.  When did you start drinking again?  It was three dollars. 
[03:59:00]  When did you start drinking again?  When it was three fucking dollars.  Because you were just drinking with Bert before, and you were like, yeah, I'm not going to do  that for a while.  And two weeks later, I guess you found three dollar vodkas.  Yeah.  Well, wait.  You remember in Chicago at the anti-social show?  Oh, yeah.  Roland got up and left halfway through the show because there was free booze in the back,  and he was filling these huge wine glasses full of vodka.  He had three of them.  They were basically red Solo cups, but full of vodka.  Hey, Toby Keith.  Yeah.  And then he drinks to the point that he's like, we're getting hot dogs later, and he gets 
[03:59:30]  back to the hotel, and he's like, I threw up.  It must have been the burger.  Yeah, it was the burger, Roland.  It wasn't the half bottle of vodka that you drank an hour ago.  And he was putting these drinks down like there was no tomorrow.  And then he would slam his cup down on the counter, and they would give him a new one.  And I was like, dude, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah.  You're going to be out of your mind.  Yeah.  He didn't care.  Well, and then, yeah, and I guess he was out of his mind because a few pictures down,  I scroll, and the night has progressed. 
[04:00:00]  Because there's a six-hour time difference in Hawaii, so I'm catching, I'm not watching this  as the night goes on.  And it's like, you know, six o'clock in the evening, and I'm just catching up on everything  that's happened.  And Roland is standing in a phone booth, pissing.  Yes.  He's pissing on a public phone, not a urinal, a telephone.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You went to a public phone and decided to piss on it?  Well, I go, I have to pee, and I go, I think I should pee here, but I go, I don't know.  And the truck goes, bro, just pee.  I'm like, all right.  And we were standing with like a crowd of people. 
[04:00:30]  And I was like, eight people.  And I was just like, dude, just piss right there.  Piss right there.  He's like, all right, okay.  Coke Logic is texting me in reference to you justifying the synchronized swimming and  little bathing suits and up on the shoulders.  He's saying that Troy is, and he's right, that you're getting very close to saying, yeah,  we blew each other, but it's just what bros do.  We're just hanging out.  We blew each other for a second.  I don't know if we're going to go that far, but you know.  You might.  No.  You don't think so?  I'm not interested in sucking a penis.  You're not.  I am not.  That's for sure.  No. 
[04:01:00]  Absolutely.  Okay.  Because the jury's been out on that for a while.  I'm glad we finally cleared that up.  No penis sucking for me.  But you are interested in seeing some urine come out of a penis into a public phone.  Absolutely.  Urinating in public is funny.  Uh-huh.  And urinating in a phone booth in public is funny as well.  Yeah.  And you like that, Roland.  Yeah, because I pissed, and then within like five seconds, some guy came and said, right  am I pissed?  So he pointed at him and laughed, and then... 
[04:01:30]  A guy comes and sits down on the pay phone.  Yeah, like, oh my God.  Your piss is all over it.  He cleansed it down.  Did he piss a lot, or did he just score a lot?  It just kept coming out.  And I kept trying to get good photos, because he kept trying to turn his back to me, and  he didn't want to like show his dick to the camera.  Right.  He wants to save that for the ladies.  Right.  Sure.  So I was like, turn more.  Turn more.  Come on.  I didn't get it.  And I'm trying to get the good picture.  Uh-huh.  Because you know, you need a good...  If you're going to Instagram it, you need a good picture.  You need to be able...  You can't just post a picture of Roland's back, and he's facing the phone booth, and then 
[04:02:00]  you write that Roland's pissing in the phone booth.  You need...  And that's what...  And your picture did have that.  You need to see the piss stream.  And that's what...  Like, I showed it to Jess while we were having a romantic honeymoon.  Yeah.  And she went, oh, he really is pissing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I said, pick up the phone.  Get on the phone.  Oh, he's a little goof.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, hey, I'm talking on the phone and I'm pissing.  Right.  Right?  And then it just...  It turned out good.  It did.  It turned out to be a great picture. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  And a guy sat in the piss?  Yeah.  Some guy walked up, what's up?  And sat down.  Oh my God, he's on my piss.  You said that, or you just laughed at him?  I did laugh and said something.  Then we left to a diner.  You went to a diner?  Yeah.  You didn't have to piss anymore, though.  I was empty and hungry.  Because you went all over the phone.  Who knew they even had public phones in New York anymore?  I didn't know.  Well, they're still, yeah, they're still around, but...  And you always think, you assume bums might be pissing on them.  I guess you never assume that talent bookers are going to get you right and piss on them. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah.  And then the funny part then, so we...  And then we took a picture with a couple of the girls from Liquid Metal.  Okay.  I was like, just because, you know, he was showing off how proud he was.  You get the bitches after you piss on a phone.  That's what the message was?  Yeah.  Okay.  And then we're like, okay, let's go get something to eat.  So we went to a diner.  And the whole way there, my Instagram is blowing up.  Both of our Instagrams are blowing up because they're tagging him on stuff.  And people are just talking shit to Roland.  Why are they talking shit?  The guy just peed on a phone. 
[04:03:30]  He should be like a hero.  They're just saying, you know, they're upset with him.  They're saying mean things.  Why would...  Look, a guy pisses on a phone and lets a photo be taken and published for your amusement.  Why would you not say, Roland, I appreciate that you did that.  It gave me something to laugh at.  Who's not laughing at a picture of Roland pissing on a phone?  They're just trying to goof on him.  You know what I mean?  Because it's like everybody thinks that they're funny and they can goof on you like everybody  on the show does.  But why not just let Roland have the laugh?  But they can't.  They need to be involved.  Okay.  So they're just tagging him. 
[04:04:00]  They're like saying all this nasty shit to him.  We're walking and literally at the whole time at the diner, he is sitting there saying  he's looking through people's Instagrams, looking at pictures of their kids, and then  he'll go back to comment on mine and he'll be like, your fucking kids are retarded.  Why would you write that on somebody's Instagram?  No, on my Instagram.  Because he's firing back at the people that are talking shit about him and he's going  down the list talking shit to every person.  Oh, so on the comment.  So it's on your Instagram and it's the comments.  On the photos. 
[04:04:30]  Yes.  And you're seeing like somebody writes Roland, you know.  Roland, your dick is inverted.  And then the next comment would be Roland saying, oh, that's funny because your kids  are retarded.  Yeah, or it was, your wife wasn't complaining when I was fucking her last night.  Did you fuck their wife or were you just saying that?  I was just saying that.  Oh, Roland.  But then what I did is I report the abuse, the comments on Instagram.  I go back and delete everything I said.  So when Instagram sees them, all they see is their retarded comments.  You see what I meant, Sal, when we were talking about Roland?  We don't push him too far because he's not afraid to ruin someone's life. 
[04:05:00]  Absolutely.  Roland's a public figure whether he likes it or not.  People are going to goof on you.  I don't know if you should necessarily be responding by saying your kids are retarded.  Well, that's the thing you can make fun of my pee-pee.  It is, it is.  It's sort of like we throw a pebble at you and Roland responds with a cannon.  Yeah.  He has a cannon in his back.  He takes a cannon out.  It's an old cannon.  It's the old school one.  And he lights the fuse and there's a massive cannonball in there.  And he's going to smash up your whole life with it. 
[04:05:30]  And he doesn't care who he takes out?  No, no.  It doesn't matter.  The old guy goes, I'm taking my kids to an amusement park.  I said, I hope you all ride the roller coaster and light latches.  And you fly.  You hope that him and his family fall off a roller coaster?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just hope that they enjoy themselves?  Because they're assholes.  Oh.  If he's an asshole, they're all assholes.  Yeah.  Roland, you were the one who was pissing on a phone, though.  A public phone.  I was cleaning it.  Come on in, Nicole from the morning mashup.  Nicole from the morning mashup is here.  We were just talking about Roland. 
[04:06:00]  He pissed on a phone.  For what reason?  On Sunday or Saturday, over the weekend.  Saturday night.  Late Saturday night.  Yeah.  He and Troy were hanging out.  Roland got a little drunk.  There was a public phone.  And so he pissed on it.  Wait, like a...  A pay phone.  A pay phone.  It's almost like I'm cleaning it.  No, it's not.  You're actually making it more dirty.  What was the reason?  You weren't drunk.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was very drunk.  You were drunk.  Oh, my God.  Nicole's looking at the picture now.  It's disgusting.  Can you see the urine stream?  I see it.  Okay. 
[04:06:30]  It's actually a great shot.  Yeah, we were just talking about how great it was.  Now, Roland was telling us that there were some comments that were not nice.  I want to find out from you, because maybe I'm just too sensitive.  Because I've been accused of that, of being, oh, there's Sam.  He goes again.  Being too nice, like always.  Well, you're peeing on that thing because it doesn't really matter.  It's a piece of garbage.  You don't have to use that thing.  But no.  Yes, people do.  It gets worse.  That's not my wrestling with my conscience here.  Okay.  As far as I'm concerned, peeing on a pay phone is funny. 
[04:07:00]  You could do it.  I mean, fine.  Okay.  People should have cell phones anyway at this point.  Get a prepaid phone.  It's like $30 at CVS.  It's cool.  Whatever floats your boat?  Roland, the comments on that were not kind towards Roland.  Because you couldn't see his penis in the photo, people said it was small.  Or they said he was fat.  Or they say whatever it is.  They make fun of Roland.  And Roland responds by looking up their Instagram, finding out if they have families or children,  and saying, your kids are retarded.  Really?  That's the response. 
[04:07:30]  It's like Italian.  You push, we fire.  Yeah, but you don't attack people's kids.  Fuck them.  No, they're talking about his penis.  Yeah, but the kids aren't talking about the penis.  But it doesn't matter.  But anything's fair game.  It is?  Yes.  If your pictures are online, fuck you.  Yes.  If they go, hey, let me make fun of you.  If I make fun of you, nothing's going to happen.  But if I make fun of your other people, it's going to push buttons.  But if you put that up there, you put it up there for people to make comments about it.  If you don't like the comments, well, it sucks for you. 
[04:08:00]  You don't have to make fun of their kids.  And vice versa.  Don't put your kids up there.  Okay, the vice versa here is like, okay, well, if you're going to comment and make nasty comments about a person,  you can bust balls.  Now that's up there.  So maybe Rolly can respond and be like, your kids are retarded.  I hope you and your family fall off a roller coaster.  And your kids are not comparable to your penis.  Oh, who says who?  That's where they come from.  They did start in the penis.  And says who?  And you got some in your eye.  Troy, you did get cum in your eye once.  And those are little babies floating around your eye socket. 
[04:08:30]  I know.  Potential babies.  Troy, you're saying that maybe, depending on the circumstance, the penis is as important as children.  Well, it's just like, if you're taking a shot, fuck you.  You know?  And if you're putting your pictures up there, if your shit's blocked, it's a private, then it's a different story.  Have you ever gotten so mad at a morning mashup listener, Nicole, that you're like, oh, well, your kids are fucking retards?  You ever do that?  No, because Stan's the only one with kids, and I think he'd knock me out if I said something about my kids.  No, no, no.  I mean like the mashup listeners.  Oh, no.  I don't think anybody's ever attacked his kids, because he's not that mean. 
[04:09:00]  No, Nicole, you're not following.  Not that mean.  You understand what I'm saying.  I'm sorry.  You're not.  I had a long weekend.  Well, you're a bit of an airhead, too, so, you know.  What happened?  No, have you ever told any of the mashup listeners, the way Roland is referring to the Opie and Anthony listeners,  have you ever gone to a mashup listener while your kids are retarded?  No, I would never do that.  You wouldn't?  That's very mean.  No, no, that's not our style on the mashup.  We don't do that.  Would they ever comment on, like...  Rich might have.  Rich might have, because he gets very offended easily.  He does. 
[04:09:30]  Yeah.  I like Rich.  You like that.  He understands.  Yeah, Rich definitely might have.  We have to go.  Okay, cool.  I'll have to do it as well.  No, you don't.  You're just going because we're going.  You don't have anything going on.  Can I ask you what she thinks about Sal's tattoo?  Okay, what do you think about Sal's tattoo?  Let me see it.  You remember Sal.  He was the intern.  He was much better as an intern.  It's very feminine.  You think it's...  I mean, it's cool, but...  But for a girl.  It's a flower.  Yeah.  Sal?  It's his thing.  It's his art.  It's not a flower.  Oh, what is it?  It looks very flower.  It's a mandala.  It's a mandala.  That sounds even more feminine. 
[04:10:00]  It's like the new version of tribal.  Is it?  I just Googled it.  It says flower.  Yeah.  Little girl flower for little princesses.  That type of thing?  Yeah.  Is that what it means in mandala princess?  No, it doesn't.  It means something.  I don't know what the fuck it means.  Do you just put something on your body?  You don't know what it means?  It's some Buddhist symbol, but I don't really...  Are you Buddhist?  No, I don't really give a shit about the meaning of things.  I just like how it looks.  It's like when people are like, oh, it's tribal.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, it doesn't know what it means.  It's just from tribal.  I just like the lettering.  It's Japanese.  I don't know what it says.  We have to go.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Sal, Roland, Troy, Nicole, Eric. 
[04:10:30]  Thank you all.  Of course.  And we'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
