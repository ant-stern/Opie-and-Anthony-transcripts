<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show featured Filter's Richard Patrick (lead vocals) and Gino (guitar) as guests. The interview began with discussion of Filter's upcoming Hammerstein Ballroom show and their song "Hey Man, Nice Shot," inspired by the suicide of Bud Dwyer.  This segued into a graphic discussion of online videos, including footage of Dwyer's suicide and a woman being hit by a train.  The conversation then devolved into discussions of pornography, with anecdotes about finding porn in hotel rooms and discovering evidence of sexual activity in their own office.  Patrick and Gino recounted their experiences with excessive drinking and debauchery during tour flights, with Patrick detailing the inspiration behind "Take a Picture," relating it to a drunken airplane incident.  He also discussed his relationship with his father and his father's fight against prostate cancer. Opie and Anthony interjected with criticisms of various pop artists and lamented the financial struggles many musicians face due to mismanagement.  The discussion also included a segment on Filter's guitars, Patrick's departure from Nine Inch Nails (attributed to "boredom"), and a caller's positive feedback on a remix of "Take a Picture."

Well, the guys from Filter made it.  Yes, we did.  We've got Richard Patrick in the studio, lead singer extraordinaire, and Gino, right? 
[00:05:00]  Yep.  The guitarist.  Yes.  How are you guys doing?  Don't move over here.  I'll move over here.  I'll help you so I can look at you.  What's up, buddy?  What's up?  How are you?  How are you doing?  Hey, don't do that spazzle.  Good old man.  Yeah.  Looking at opening.  Long story.  You guys playing the Hammerstein Ballroom?  Yes, we are.  And we want to thank you guys for coming on our show.  This is the first band we've had on since going all talk on our radio show, but we're still  like rock and roll guys.  All right.  And we still spin the tunes.  We just played the one with Crystal Meth, Trip Like We Do. 
[00:05:30]  Like I Do.  Like I Do, excuse me.  Right on.  And we're going to play a couple from the new album as well.  Yeah, for some reason, the record company guys, sometimes they feel a little leery about  bands coming on our show because we don't play music, which is stupid because you  could sit here and talk and get the point across.  Yeah, we talk.  Yeah, see?  We can go first.  Perfect English.  We speak English.  Thank God.  Well, let's back up because Hey Man, Nice Shot.  Yeah.  We used to play that a lot at another station we used to work at, and we've played it here 
[00:06:00]  a bunch.  Mm-hmm.  Is that song really about Bud Dwyer?  Loosely.  Loosely?  It's based on anyone who really killed themselves.  Mm-hmm.  Thought it was going to help the world, you know, and obviously.  I mean, you know, there's references kind of to the situation.  You obviously saw the video, like we all did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a copy of the raw footage.  Oh, yeah.  It's nasty.  It's uncut, big, long, and it's from the side where you just watch the blood pour out 
[00:06:30]  of his nose.  I can't even watch that.  And you want to give the story really fast, just get everyone on the same page?  He's a state treasurer that held a press conference, and he was basically, they were  going to throw him away in jail forever for like rebezzling hundreds of millions of dollars  or something.  And he just said, no way, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to go.  And before he was going to be sentenced, he held a press conference, and then he pulled  out a .45 caliber revolver, stuck it in his mouth.  He goes, first he goes, stop, get back, this might hurt someone. 
[00:07:00]  And then he was going to say something, and someone rushed him, and he just blew his  head.  Great.  Yeah.  I wonder how the guy that rushes him feel.  Yeah.  Maybe he wasn't going to do.  You know?  I don't know.  We get those clips all the time sent to us and stuff.  Yeah.  Because, yeah, you get like, people send you gross clips on the internet.  And I can't watch that.  Yeah.  Oh, it skews me out.  I got that other video of, let's see, what was that, a band from TV.  That's how we...  Oh, that's...  Yeah, yeah.  Some of that stuff on TV. 
[00:07:30]  The woman with the train.  Oh, yeah.  She gets hit by the train and just goes spinning into the camera.  It knocks the camera down.  Yeah.  Like a chunk of her body hits a tripod.  She was liquefied.  And you can look back, if you put it in slow-mo, like really slow, you can see the teeth flying  out of her mouth.  Oh, my God.  You know, I can't stand getting clips like that.  The smut, porno.  Oh, send it out.  I love that. 
[00:08:00]  I love the sex stuff.  Porno's good.  Yeah, you can't...  That never gets old.  How long have you had a computer?  And still, like...  I've had computers since my Commodore 64.  And it's still like, oh, porn.  Yeah.  It perks you right up, you know?  Yeah.  Beastiality.com is just hours of good, clean fun, huh?  You just can't get enough.  If you're surfing and you're looking for some information that you need and then you find  it, you go right back to smut.  You know, what scares me is that he slowed down the tape to see the teeth flying out of  the mouth.  No one else caught that?  Oh, I'm researching a song. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  No, you know what's funny?  We were in some hotel in Europe when we were on tour and they had a computer in Rich's  room.  He had this suite and he's like, oh, man, I can't get on or whatever.  So I finally got online and then they have, like, your 10...  The guy who had the room prior to Rich, the 10, like, you know, his favorite hit list  as far as, like, you know, and it's all porno.  It was all porno.  All porno websites.  I've got to clear your history.  I don't know if I want to sleep in this bed.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, you need that infrared light imaging thing to do with it.  Yeah, I need to know about the cops. 
[00:09:00]  That's funny.  Yeah, the light.  We actually went over our office with that light because we found out that one of the  people that work here was having sex in our office.  Really?  Everything was contaminated.  We had cops come in and, like, cordon off the area, get the lights, chemicals, and  they're like, oh, yeah, there's semen on the mouse to the computer.  There's semen on the couch, on the desk, on our phones, on the keyboard.  They could have cloned an army out of what they found in the friggin' office.  It was disgusting.  So, yeah, God knows what's in the hotel rooms and stuff. 
[00:09:30]  You wouldn't even want to...  I just pray to God that they could do a good job.  I'm going to the store to get hefty bags and laying them over my mattress this evening.  And you've got to know they don't clean that top blanket, so you're really...  Oh, you guys spend a lot of time in hotels.  That's the first thing to go.  The first thing that goes, you get rid of the top blanket, man.  That's disgusting.  Oh, man.  You know, getting back to the Bud Dwyer video, my buddy worked in TV, and there was a rap video  going around to that footage. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah, someone put some kind of...  You see that?  No, I didn't see that.  I heard...  I saw someone made a video out of Ministries, The Land, Rape, and Honey.  You know, where he starts laughing.  You know that song?  Which one?  Ministries, The Land, Rape, and Honey.  You know who you are?  The song, Land...  Yeah, you know who you are.  Yeah, you know who you are.  Yeah, you know who you are.  That was brutal.  They just kept doing it over and over.  That's what the Bud Dwyer with the rap beats and his hair going back and forth.  Yeah, every time they pulled the record back for a scratch, it was like...  Like, oh, man, disgusting. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know.  It's pretty brutal.  It's kind of like a water balloon hitting a wall, isn't it?  Not into it.  Well, we have a lot of people that want to talk to you.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We're hanging out with Filter.  We got Richard and Gino from the band.  And let's go to the phones here and talk to Dan real fast.  Dan, what's up?  What's up?  How you doing?  Great.  Rob, how you doing?  Let's just say everyone's fine.  Everyone is great.  Regardless of names.  All right.  We're all changing names today.  We have Richard and Gino.  I'm Fred.  Dan.  Dan. 
[00:11:00]  Richard, sorry.  All right.  Oh, you called him Rob.  That's what we were talking about.  He thought you were Rob.  Richard Rob.  Rob.  Oh, yeah.  No, you're confusing me with my brother, the actor.  Yeah, that's something.  Right.  I just found that out.  One of the Sopranos.  He's a Soprano.  Or was Danny on the Sopranos.  Right.  And he was in...  T2.  T2, thank you.  Terminated 2.  T2.  Copland.  That was like the...  Fire in the Sky.  He's got a new movie coming out with Matt Damon called All the Pretty Horses.  That looks like a hair. 
[00:11:30]  Billy Bob Thornton's in it.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you ever get confused for him?  No.  No?  Not at all.  No.  He's...  In the eyes a little bit.  You kind of look like him.  In the eyes a little bit.  Look at that.  Yeah.  He's just in the face.  That's pretty scary, man.  That was pretty scary.  That's pretty good.  That's cool, though, that both of you have a really good career going for yourselves, you  know?  It's really sweet.  I mean...  You could have the bitter, you know, brother thing where one is, you know, maybe doing the  number one afternoon show in New York and the other one's knocking tin.  That's a bitter, bitter scene. 
[00:12:00]  He's actually that competitive.  Is he really?  He's like, I think my brother's getting bigger than me.  He's all pissed off.  I think Richie's going platinum, and, you know, some of my movies go right to video.  Well, Take a Picture has made you guys huge.  That's a big song.  My God.  What is that song about?  I know, but a lot of people think it has a deep meaning.  It's just like a lot of...  It's got something to do with someone being naked on a plane or something? 
[00:12:30]  I was really wasted one night.  And I was on an airplane, and I just got drunk or, you know, at the altitude, you know?  That's what does it.  And I just was taking my clothes off, man.  I was just taking my clothes off.  Really?  Yeah.  And they were going to arrest me.  And I just had like $700 for some reason in my wallet.  I don't know why I would have that much money anyways, but I had like $700.  I'm like, please, don't arrest me, please.  You gave them money? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Gave the stewardess money.  The last time I got crazy on a plane, we landed in Hawaii, and they said, dude, get off the plane.  And I walk out, and there's cops.  And they're the Hawaiian cops.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  You know, oh, my God.  Gano.  And so they just went right through customs.  Everyone else had to wait two hours.  We got right through customs, right, and they just pushed us right out into the street.  So I was sitting in the disturbance.  Oh, God.  I was so mad, because I was sitting there waiting in line. 
[00:13:30]  I'm like, wait a second.  These guys got a personal escort.  They just got through customs.  Right through.  Right.  And then they're out there on the curb smoking and laughing.  David Frank.  Meanwhile, I'm with Patrick, the tour manager.  Like, he's tripping.  He's just like, I'm quitting.  I'm never doing this again.  I'm never doing this again.  I can't take this.  I'm an English road manager.  Do you have a problem, like, flying?  No, I just, I don't, you know.  Yeah, it's the free drinks in business class.  That's the problem.  Like an eight. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  That's the kicker right there.  And the other guy that was getting drunk with me, he was coming up, because he had coach.  He was a part of the crew.  The crew doesn't fly business usually.  And he comes up, and he's like, Rich, get me a cognac.  I'm like, can I have an order of, what was that?  Going over to the curtain.  What'd you want?  Okay.  Can I get a couple of beers or whatever?  He snuck up there, too, and stole a bottle.  He snuck up.  The whole bottle of whatever it was. 
[00:14:30]  Because then he ran in the back, and then he gave it to our bass player.  He threw it in his chair, and the lady, like, came up to him, do you have a bottle of that  curtain?  Oh, that's ballsy going through that curtain, man.  Oh, yeah.  That's a ballsy move.  He was cool, though.  And the funny thing was, the cops were totally cool.  They were just like, dude, you just had too good a time, and we're just here to make  sure you go home.  That's awesome.  They were so cool.  And, you know, even those stewardess were, they were laughing, because we were just,  it was just funny.  We were just.  Wow, good way to get through customs.  Hey, they weren't laughing at Frank, though. 
[00:15:00]  Frank, there was the Toronto rugby team was sitting right in front of us, and Frank was  like, picking fights with them.  Oh, a rugby team.  Oh, that's smart.  Yeah, exactly.  I was like, Frank, Frank, you can stop him.  My brother's a T-1000.  Shut up.  Tom, what's going on?  We're hanging out with Filter today.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Tom?  Hey, listen, I want to ask Richard, and take a picture.  The lyric where he says, hey, Dad, what do you think about your son now?  Seems like really heartfelt. 
[00:15:30]  Did your dad have a problem with you going into, like, you know, music?  No, it's just, basically, it's like the double-edged sword, like, you know, hey, Dad, I'm in  jail.  Can you come and get me out?  Or, you know, hey, Dad, I'm standing in front of 10,000 people tonight.  What do you think of that?  So, it's just, basically, I really love my father.  And I just want to, I always have his pride.  You know, I want him to be very proud of me.  And, no, it's very heartfelt, you know.  And, actually, it's been really kind of tough.  He just got through prostate cancer. 
[00:16:00]  Whoa.  So, the other night, it was kind of, the other night, he was, came to the show, he's playing  golf again, he's fine, you know, it's all gone, the cancer's gone and everything.  And he was on stage, and I just looked over, and I just was like, oh, my God, this is so  cool.  My dad survived cancer, and here he is, and what do you think?  And I just, I just totally lost it.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  It's very meaningful.  I mean, you know, the key to lyrics and getting people to kind of relate to it is just being 
[00:16:30]  honest and write what you know.  And, you know, at that particular time in my life, I guess I just, you know, hey, Dad,  what do you think?  Cool.  Isn't that pretty cool?  Like, to be able to get that, I don't know, deep into something where you're creative to  write songs like that.  I'm such a shallow son of a bitch, I couldn't write a nursery rhyme.  I mean, you know, like, you write things, and you really have to dig into it to see  what it means.  And, you know, if I ever try to sit down, it's like, oh, God, is that contrived and  stupid.  That's a true talent, man. 
[00:17:00]  That's great.  I do that most of the time.  Really?  Do you write something down and just go, oh, is that lame?  Oh, God, what was that?  There's probably a head he's throwing away.  Let's get a great tune.  Yeah, my crap is Backstreet Boys, you know, forget it.  You can trash the Backstreet Boys.  I don't realize.  We don't mind.  Keith, what's going on?  We're a little tired of that whole situation going on with music.  It's so weird.  It's nice to have a breath of fresh air, listen to you guys and stuff.  I mean, for the love of God, Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears and the boy bands, you're 
[00:17:30]  just like, every station pumping this dribble out.  This is garbage.  Even there was Sting last night with the Backstreet Boys.  What's he doing?  Oh, God.  That was a little tough to swallow, man.  What are you doing?  I hope he has fun cash in that check.  Hope it bleeds.  And then he was talking about how they're good singers.  Yeah.  Walking out.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, man.  Let's see where they are.  I used to love the police. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were all talking about that earlier.  I mean, what happened to that badass thing that was like right between, like, Ghost in  the Machine and Synchronicity?  Yeah.  He was like a badass.  Who, like, had the sharpest wit.  He was just, you know.  The guy was just.  Yeah.  He was s***.  He was on.  Now he's kissing Backstreet Boy ass.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Mom.  We want that police reunion tour.  It ain't gonna happen.  No, it's not gonna happen.  Todd, those guys.  They couldn't even play at his wedding.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:18:30]  They couldn't even get together enough to play at a wedding.  Yeah, they got him up there for Sting's wedding.  And Sting turns around and starts screaming at Stuart again.  Yeah.  He's up there saying, you're rushing it again.  You're rushing it.  Oh, my God.  No way.  Yeah.  That's true.  It's a true story.  It's a true story.  Yeah.  God, that's funny.  You don't watch behind the music, Richard?  I see so much of myself in all these bands.  It's like just a, it's every band is the same terrible story.  Yeah.  It's always a. 
[00:19:00]  And then they found drugs.  It's gotta be a nightmare to think, oh, my God.  You know, someday.  The money was gone.  And then.  There's always.  The manager ran off with, you know.  The horror when they found out that all their money was invested in widgets by their manager.  And you're like, oh, no, not the widget.  We have nothing.  The long deserted road has to come up.  They show that road.  Yeah, yeah.  That's.  The road is usually for a car accident.  Yeah.  That usually happens.  You know, they show that.  Or they show, you know, the parents. 
[00:19:30]  That's always a big thing.  Billy Joel lost his money.  That was another one.  Billy Joel was broke.  Billy Joel.  How does that.  His manager stole it.  Yeah.  I mean, and this is after hit album, after hit album.  And he turns out broke.  You guys got people watching that, right?  Oh, totally.  Yeah.  I don't know how it happens.  What about my CPA?  Really?  I'm a taxed by a public accountant.  All he does is worry about my brother's money.  Good.  My money.  Very good.  And the band's money.  And how little they can be.  Oh, my God. 
[00:20:00]  Did I say that?  Did I say that?  Are you guys finally seeing something?  Because I know usually the first album you get, like, tooled on.  And then.  Yeah.  Are you guys seeing something?  Yeah.  We moved up from Motel 6 to Holiday Inn.  There you go.  It's a Holiday Inn Express.  But it's good.  It's good.  The towels are clean.  That sucks.  At least you're.  Yeah.  We're doing fine.  Obviously, you must have been playing and writing since you were young kids and stuff.  Yeah.  And moving your own equipment and stuff like that.  We've been through it.  We've been through it, you know. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  And now we should get our just desserts.  Cool.  Seeing something.  Let's go to Scotty.  Scotty, what's up?  Hey, what's going on all day?  We've got Richard and Gino from Filter in the studio.  Gino, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good, man.  Hey, I haven't gotten a chance to see you guys live.  One question for you.  Sure.  What's the, Gino, you rely, what, on the Fender side of the house or what?  On the what?  You a Fender man or Gibson man?  This is a Fender versus Gibson question.  The eternal Fender versus Gibson. 
[00:21:00]  Actually, I play guitars from Sears.  Okay.  No, I don't.  No, no, no.  Actually, seriously, we all play Fender Custom Shops.  We're really lucky that they came up to us many years ago and were interested in endorsing us.  And now it's really amazing.  I mean, we can call them up and say we want, like, an ash body, you know, maple neck, rosy  pepper, all that stuff.  You're going to get jealous that I'm getting a red, white, and blue American Telecaster,  American flag.  We're like little, like two brothers. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Richie saw my Doc Holliday Telecaster, which is essentially, you know, it's like this black  one with a pearl pearl.  And he's like, oh, man, I want, now I've got to get three of those.  Give me five of those.  You guys must have creamed when Fender came up to you, though.  It's like, hey, that's like a musician's dream come true.  Like, how long would you like your neck?  What kind of pickup would you like?  Oh, wow.  What kind of wood would you like for the body?  Would you like it in this?  What color paint would you like?  Would you like bird's eye maple, flame maple?  I mean, it's just...  That's a wet dream right there. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, totally.  Yeah.  I mean, Gibson makes a good guitar, but we play Epiphone acoustics.  But Fender, definitely for the electrics.  Could you put in the burn marks on the head so it looks like we're smoking and sticking the  cigarettes in there?  You know what's scary is they do that.  Are you kidding?  No, no, they have a vintage thing.  You can order, like, these vintage guitars that, like, they, like, I don't know, they  sandblast them or something and make it look...  Put a hole in the pick guard.  Like a dragon bar.  Like you're some road warrior who's been gigging since, you know, 1968. 
[00:22:30]  Sand guitar.  Yeah, I got my same axe.  Hey, Richard, what's going on?  Anthony.  Anthony?  Yeah, what's up?  What do you got for filter?  Oh, hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Yo, Richard, I just want to ask you a question, man.  Uh, what made you decide to leave Nine Inch Nails?  Um, pretty much boredom.  Really?  Yeah, I didn't do anything.  You didn't play guitar.  I was...  I swear to God, there wasn't even any guitar parts, dude.  I used to be like, wait.  I used to stand on stage and wait for like...  Are you kidding, man?  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  The song Sin, I did nothing.  Wow.  The song Sin, I waited for this.  What about Wish, dude?  Wish, I played pretty much constantly.  Yeah.  Um, but no, Trent's a good guy, but it's, it's, you know, it was just boredom.  And, and I, I wasn't singing, I wasn't doing anything, I wasn't making any money, I wasn't...  Well, you picked that up now, man, totally.  Oh, well, thanks, bro.  I played it.  You know, another ballsy move.  You might just want to stick with that because it is Nine Inch Nails and then you go off,  uh, with your own gig and could end up being the other guy from Wham if you're not... 
[00:23:30]  That's true.  Oh, I miss those Wham days.  I miss, but check this out.  I'm, I'm like out charting his new record.  I'm like doing better than him.  Hell yeah.  I don't, I don't understand that and it feels weird.  You don't understand that.  Title of record is an amazing piece of work.  I crank that damn thing in the subway all the time.  Thanks.  Welcome to the fold.  I mean, the loud stuff is the best.  To yourself though.  Huh?  To yourself and your headphones.  What do you mean?  You crank it.  Well, I scream out the lyrics. 
[00:24:00]  People run away from me.  Yeah, people stay away from me.  It keeps the bums away if you're screaming like that.  I love the honesty though.  I didn't do anything on stage.  I mean, I would get, I sat there and waited and then I'd get tackled, tackled.  Right.  And then I, and it was every night, you know, okay, here it comes, you know.  And then, you know, it's just boredom.  You at least got to say you were in the house.  I sat on a bus.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  You know.  It works both ways.  I don't know.  It's good and bad.  You still talk to Trent and the guys?  We, we, we ended on a really bad note and I, you know, we never talked and then finally  was just like, dude, look, you know, we're, it's a big world.  We're, we're both making it, you know.  It's, you know, so we, we did make up after a while and we came out that we went to, uh.  You should have them open for you.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Back to the police.  It would be, it would be, that would be a great show though, man. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  I think we're running out of time.  I know.  It's getting so late.  Damn.  We shouldn't end on that note.  No.  Do we have another caller?  Yeah.  We have tons of them.  Let me pick out a good one here.  Actually, they're all a little technical.  Uh, Matt, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  Um, I just wanted to find out.  I'm a, I'm a breakbeat DJ in the city.  I just came back from Miami.  I just played your, uh, remix track by Freak Nasty, the Take a Picture.  Oh, cool.  I just want to tell you guys, the crowd went off the hook. 
[00:25:30]  That is one of the unbelievable, I don't know if you, have you heard the remix yet by,  by Freak Nasty?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Take a picture stuff?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  It's on, it's on.  It's on F-111 records.  It's one of the most amazing breakbeat remixes I've ever had.  I just wanted to know if you guys are putting out any other tracks with, with Freak Nasty  or Rennie Pilgrim, anything like that?  Uh, there's a bunch of remixes of, uh, Best Things.  Yeah, there's a ton of, uh, that are coming out.  It's more transient, though.  It's more like, um, Transy, I guess.  Because it had Welcome to the Fold, too. 
[00:26:00]  That's another slamming track.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah, that was, uh, that remix was hysterical.  It's, it's, uh, an old Alesis HR-16 drum machine that I used to have, that I used to have when  I was, like, 14, back in 87, 89, or something like that.  And, uh, yeah, it was just so bad, I loved it.  It was, it was just a terrible remix, but it sounded awesome.  Oh, the sound, right now, that's, that's what the sound's all about right now, the pub's  down there.  But that, take a picture, I just have to say, people everywhere, whenever I lay it down, 
[00:26:30]  I'd be playing a trance set, it is just, people hear that, and they're like, what the f***?  Ooh, I'm sorry.  Sorry about that.  Nice.  But they were just like, it's off the hook, though.  I just wanted to go.  Yeah, we had to dump.  Yeah, we had to dump.  Yeah, sorry about that.  They say, what the F.  What the F.  When you play that.  Well, yeah, it's, it's an incredible record.  I just want to, uh, give you, give you guys some respect and say thanks for that.  You have some excellent records, man.  Oh, man.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  That's, that's, makes it all worth it, bro.  But thanks for, thanks for putting me through.
