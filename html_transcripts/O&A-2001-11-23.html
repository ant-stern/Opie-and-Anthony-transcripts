<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a scathing critique of daytime talk shows, specifically targeting the Jenny Jones show for allegedly exploiting underage girls in segments featuring teenage strippers, some as young as 13.  The hosts contrasted this with their own show's approach, arguing that their provocative content was at least upfront.  The criticism extended to Maury Povich, Jerry Springer, and Sally Jessy Raphael, citing graphic examples of guests with physical abnormalities or challenging family situations, including  "Progeria kids," Siamese twins, and obese individuals.  A caller, Amy, engaged in a heated argument with the hosts, exchanging insults and vulgar language.  Anthony then shared humorous, and sometimes disturbing, anecdotes about his family's Thanksgiving traditions and his childhood clothing choices, dictated by his mother's questionable fashion sense, including a fur coat that made him a target for bullying.

This transitioned into further reminiscing about his childhood, particularly back-to-school shopping, and name-dropping Charles Nelson Reilly.  The segment continued with sexually explicit jokes and crude humor.  Numerous local advertisements aired throughout, including for a smoke shop, fitness equipment, a motorsports dealership, Galleons (with a buy-one-get-one-free sale), an Ozzy Osbourne public service announcement against drunk driving, and Lyle Video News (promoting adult entertainment).  A caller, Adam, detailed his experiences moving in with his girlfriend, focusing on their differing lifestyles and hygiene habits, prompting more sexually suggestive and crude humor from the hosts.

A humorous, crude, and sexually suggestive Irish folk song about menstruation was played.  The hosts then discussed the upcoming Million Youth March, expressing skepticism about organizer Khalid Muhammad.  Several callers from Harlem responded, offering varying perspectives ranging from apprehension to amusement and disagreement with the hosts' assessment of their neighborhood.  The show concluded with a bizarre, humorous story about a man found dead, naked, atop a killer whale named "Till I Come," followed by a fictional, raunchy and sexually suggestive interview with Popeye the Sailor Man, involving encounters with sea creatures.  Beyond the hosts and callers Amy and Adam, no other in-studio guests were mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Is T-Boy around today?  Maybe we can get him in in a little while.  I want to see how his Halloween went.  We'll see if we can get him in here in a few minutes.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, you guys see the Jenny Jones show today?  Yeah, that's what we wanted to talk about.  The teen strippers.  Yeah, here's the premise, Opie.  Jenny Jones gets people to come out and talk about how horrible one of their relatives are.  They're either a daughter, sister, whatever, that is stripping. 
[00:00:30]  She's teen, you know, anywhere from 13 up to 17, stripping.  And these people are very annoyed.  Another teen show.  Another teen show on Jenny Jones.  So Jenny, of course, and the audience there just getting all pissed off at the people that are stripping  and getting pissed off at the parents saying they should do something.  And this is horrible.  At one point, sitting there, they drag out this 17-year-old chick. 
[00:01:00]  Hot.  Did you see the 17-year-old one?  I missed the first half hour or so.  I think this was toward the end.  They had this guy.  He was 40 years old.  The father.  The tall girl?  Of this girl, yeah.  The one with the dark hair.  Yeah, I've got her.  She's wearing little shorts and a bikini top.  Yep.  Holy hot.  I couldn't take my eyes over a crotch.  She's got like a camel toe going on.  And she's stripping.  And she's stripping.  And the mom's right there?  No, the mom isn't there.  The father was there.  Oh, God.  And they had been estranged from each other. 
[00:01:30]  Now the father's all pissed off.  She's trying to become an emancipated child.  And she loves drugs.  She's saying, I love the Coke.  I love everything.  She's partying.  She's stripping.  What does she strip for?  Friends.  And at bachelor parties and whatnot.  She makes some cash.  You know, she's like, I'm going to put myself through college.  Then they had some fat 16-year-old white chick that just was talking like a black chick.  With the stretch marks on her stomach?  Oh.  She's like, I'll make time for my child. 
[00:02:00]  And she's whiter than white.  I mean, pale white.  Her sister is sitting there going, you don't take care of your child.  And if I was in the audience, I'd go, excuse me, why do you talk like black chicks?  What are you doing?  Why do you talk like, no one ever asked that question.  Well, let me tell you something.  I look good and I dance.  I'm 16.  But I've been with more men than you.  It's like, what?  She's this backwards white chick who, I don't know who's paying her to strip. 
[00:02:30]  What a slob she was.  Then the best part.  Here it is.  Here's the despicableness of Jenny Jones and all these talk shows.  The whole premise is how horrid it is that these young girls are stripping.  They go backstage.  They have that backstage cam where they talk about the girl outside.  Then you see the girl backstage mouthing off to the camera and saying, uh-uh, and dancing.  13-year-old.  Is this before she went to boot camp? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, I guess that's how they try to remedy the whole thing.  They sent her to boot camp.  But that's more of a Sally, Jesse, Raphael thing.  Or a Maury.  Maury.  We're going to boot camp.  You sent her to boot camp for two hours.  Ooh.  Yeah, ooh, that'll solve the problem.  Like, these kids aren't beat up enough.  So, uh, a 13-year-old backstage.  And not one of those 13-year-olds where you go, wow, she looks, you know, 18.  13 looking like she's 10 or 11.  Dressed in this little halter top and shorts.  Shaking her ass.  And, uh, dancing for the camera. 
[00:03:30]  As they're talking about how horrible it is that she's doing something like this.  Dancing for her 19-year-old brother's friends.  And, uh, the mother supports this.  The mother supports it?  The mother's sitting outside.  She goes, I support it.  I know where she is.  And it's not like she's taking her clothes off.  She just dances for her brother's friends.  So they were showing the hot outfit that she dances in, probably, right?  She's dancing in this, yeah, little shorts and halter top thing.  So she comes out and the whole audience booing her, booing her, you know. 
[00:04:00]  And she's like, you don't know me.  That whole act.  And Jenny Jones sitting there on her high horse, uh, talking about how awful this is.  Meanwhile, think about it.  I wouldn't know this girl, uh, was out there.  I wouldn't have seen her dancing in her little shorts and halter top if she hadn't been booked  to do that exact thing on the Jenny Jones show.  And they made sure they got a good shot of her strutting her stuff backstage.  Yeah.  Oh, it wasn't just talking about it and sitting her down and making sure you don't come on  this show unless you're dressed appropriately for a girl that age. 
[00:04:30]  No, they tell her, make sure she's dressed in the same stuff she dances in.  Put her backstage.  Okay, the camera's going to be on you.  We're going live.  You make sure you dance just like you dance for the 19-year-old boys.  Look, it's under the guise of helping, uh, this situation out.  Now, we've caught flack.  Shows, uh, uh, uh, like our show catches flack for exploitation by some of the same people.  You get a Jenny Jones talking about this show, how awful, oh, we're exploiting, and people 
[00:05:00]  are exploiting these girls.  Now, there's no ulterior motive when we ask a girl to take a whiffle ball bat and jam it  in your...  You know what I mean?  This isn't us going on and doing that and saying we're doing it to maybe cure colon cancer.  Oh, we know what we're doing.  We know what we're doing.  The people know what they're getting.  There's no excuse to be a man.  Basically, what you're saying is we don't fake it.  Right.  Like, Jenny Jones is making believe they really care when, uh, the reality is they just want  to, you know, make sure they get, uh, some nice, nice, uh, ratings from these shows.  We know teen girls hot. 
[00:05:30]  And we know, bring them on the show, it rules.  They know the same thing.  But, uh, they play dance music when the girls come out and tell them.  Hell yeah!  Oh, man.  And the girls are strutting.  Some of these girls are strutting.  They're not even developed chests.  Uh, like they're strippers.  And then the brother comes out of this 13-year-old girl.  The mother is sitting on the couch supporting her 13-year-old for dancing.  The brother comes out and he, uh, I guess, uh, is, uh, he was half black, half white. 
[00:06:00]  The mother's white.  And the father, I don't know where he was, but you could tell from the children that he  was a black guy.  Uh, he comes out like he's pimping his 13-year-old sister now.  She can do a pole dance.  Uh, she struts her stuff.  You like what you see?  He's pointing at her ass.  You like what you see?  Uh-huh.  That's the body, man.  That's it.  So what was Jenny Jones doing?  I, I hate to say this.  The brother was all dirty from our show.  It was Lorenzo.  Which I'm embarrassed to say, but...  Jenny Jones is not even sick.  She's, she's in the audience holding the mic with that concerned twat face on. 
[00:06:30]  Like, this is horrible.  How do you support this?  You're showing it.  You have this underage girl parading around half-naked dancing to dance music on your show.  She's doing the exact same thing for a national audience, but yet she's outraged at the whole  thing.  What a bitch.  Oh, please.  Would we have her on this show?  You're damn right we would. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, Jenny Jones or the...  No, the 13-year-old stripper.  We'd get it legal.  Barely.  Well, when we say teens, we, we do mean 18 and 19.  She's getting 13-year-old girls dancing around.  Depends, no, actually it depends on what state we're in.  Right.  True.  Why don't people come down on Jenny Jones and go, oh my God, you've got a 13-year-old  girl shaking her ass.  Fran, what's going on?  Yeah, it could have been worse.  It could have been one of those, my teenagers kicking my ass episodes every day that they  show on every show. 
[00:07:30]  That is a funny one, man, when you see the mother...  Yeah, we see like the girl, like nine-year-old, nine-year-old's four foot nothing, 90-nothing  pounds.  And the mom's like the 300-pound trailer park mom.  And the kids are going, shut up, shut up, you don't know me.  Whoa, yeah, I'm the toughest motherfucker in the universe.  That's like the funniest thing.  I mean...  I love those episodes where they're sitting down and go, Janet, I've got to tell you,  just the other day, I was doing the laundry, and little Joe Bob snuck up behind me and  hit me in the head with a baseball bat. 
[00:08:00]  And the whole thing is going, ooh, ooh, ooh.  And then the little kid just stands up and he's like, I don't care, I'll do it again.  And I've got Pejoria.  It's a table in my head.  You ever watch like Maury when he has like those kids that like...  Like the other day you were talking about the kid who's like eight and he's like, looks  like 90.  Yeah, yeah, the little Pejoria kid.  Yeah.  We call him P-Boy.  They have the girl with the face, and her face has got like Michael Jackson beat a Ligo  at times three.  Oh, the freak show episodes, that are also helping. 
[00:08:30]  Every day it's either, Maury's either got, Maury or Jenny or Sally, or like the lesser  class ones, like the Springer.  Yeah.  Maury's got the Trail Park Trash 5, like this morning.  Maury is more for the freak shows.  Yeah, how about like, I used to be fine, I used to be a geek, now I'm fine, and everybody  stole from Jenny or Ricky.  That's a Ricky one.  I don't even watch Ricky anymore because it's all paternity tests.  Yeah.  How about the 300-pound girls who think they look like Stephanie McMahon?  Yeah, when they come out and they're dressed and everyone boos, they go, you know you want 
[00:09:00]  it.  They're holding their arms, I swear, right on their hips, and their hands are three feet  apart.  Yeah.  And they're just shaking it.  You know you want it.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  You know you want it.  You look a little like M.A. from like Fashion Emergency, I can believe in, because she's beautiful,  but when you look like the big show, and you're a female, and you're 500 pounds, and you're  like, yeah, I know, let them walk out too well.  You're like, the mole on your hip, you can show it.  It's awful.  I can't believe people are still watching these shows. 
[00:09:30]  I gave up on them, you know, over a year.  There are different versions of the show.  There's the Jerry Springer, which is the fake fighting now, so I'm not really into that.  It was cool when they used to really punch people in the face on that show, but that's  gone, so that sucks.  But he usually has the white trash relationship problems.  Jenny and Sally love the teen girls.  Jenny, it's just all about the sex.  Sally occasionally gets the women.  You used to watch regularly.  I know the shows. 
[00:10:00]  Maury makes believe, I know this much, because I take a peek at Maury every once in a while,  he makes believe he really cares about the people.  He cares.  That Maury, probably the most despicable.  The sex ones, yeah, you know what you're getting into there.  The Maury ones, Maury, day after day, will do child freak shows.  Where he brings kids that you know are just effed up, legless children.  Kids that, oh, this was always a good one.  And in a couple of minutes, young Billy's going to come out. 
[00:10:30]  His father doused him in gasoline and threw a lighter on him, and he was burnt on 100% of  his body, third degree burns.  We're going to bring him out here and throw him a little party.  And you're just like, so don't go anywhere.  And now you're not, because you've got to see what the hell this is like.  The only kid is self-conscious.  He probably can't even look at himself in the mirror, and now he's going to show that  face and his body to millions on TV.  And then Maury does the thing where he gets real close to him, holds the hand, gets so  close, like two inches from the face, and goes, you know, you're a special child, and 
[00:11:00]  we're going to do something for you today.  And the audience is just, oh, oh.  He doesn't care.  Let's roll Timmy in.  He's just a head.  He's a head on a gurney, but he's, you're a special head.  How are my ratings?  Check him.  Check him as the...  Check the mid-show ratings, because we might have to go to another freak.  Check him as the head rolls onto the stage.  Are we doing better?  Don't make me bring out Vag Girl.  It's just a vag with a beating heart.  I was saving it for sleep, but case of emergency. 
[00:11:30]  Break glass.  Break glass.  And there is where you will find, like, the P-Boy kids, where they bring them out in  a gaggle.  Oh, they've got like five or six of them.  And Maury's, you know, and we're going to give your parents a minivan.  Cart you around.  Someone check the audience.  Are they crying yet?  No?  All right.  Bring another one out.  Not enough tears?  Let them talk about how if the barometric pressure gets too high, his head caves in.  Can we talk about that?  Get the audience crying.  Give them some free gift certificates for a restaurant in Times Square. 
[00:12:00]  I've got to go home and ban Connie.  You're a special kid.  You're a special kid.  And even though your nose cracked off during the show, you're a special child.  I know that, Maury.  Thank you, Maury, for caring about me.  I'm a normal kid.  And, you know, Maury, as I just want to say, it's a dream come true to be on...  All right, we'll be back right after this with Colon Man.  Find out why he's called Colon Man. 
[00:12:30]  But, Maury, you said you...  Shut up, you little raisin.  Look at you.  It's like someone left you out on a tarp in the sun.  But, Maury, you said you cared about me.  I did, but the show's over, kid.  Look, I can see your pulse for your rolling paper-thin skull.  You need to realize not all the baby turtles make it to the ocean.  Move on.  Sometimes the seagulls get them.  That's right.  Sometimes they flop around. 
[00:13:00]  Seagull gets them, snaps their little neck.  Look at this skull.  It's like a helium balloon a kid took home after, like, three days.  Joey, what's up?  Hey, I'm not to hop back on Jenny.  I did see that today.  She's pretty much the pig.  But she...  Did they coach the girls backstage?  I mean, they all come right out going, you know, oh, what, what, what?  Oh, don't hate, don't hate, don't hate.  You know they are told what to do to titillate the crowd.  And Jenny Jones, the producers, they know that show. 
[00:13:30]  They don't want surprises.  So when those girls are dancing backstage, the guy at the camera is telling them,  shake it, shake it.  You're on.  Shake it.  Shake it.  Because sometimes you see the girls, they're just standing there.  They're doing nothing when they cut to that shot.  And all of a sudden they look off camera, and then they go, oh.  And then they start dancing.  Yeah.  Like they've just been shaking their little asses the whole time.  But Jenny is good for one thing, though.  Three out of five days of the week, she always has the good girls, the bad girls,  or look at me now.  And they always come on with these tremendous tans, and it's awesome. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Three days out of the week, she's good.  The other two days, she's a pig.  But the fat teen girls, always funny.  But then they'll get the ringer hot chick in there.  And then the makeover shows are great.  Wait, you know, I've got to stop, because I want to make sure people understand this.  You know, what it is, it's exploitation.  We understand that.  We do exploit on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, hell, we love it.  But we don't fake it.  Like these talk shows, they exploit, but then they believe they're trying to do some good  to bring the community.  To bring the shrink out at the end of the show to tell why they're doing this 
[00:14:30]  and how the parents can stop doing it.  Oh, please.  Pretend she cares.  If she gets so many guests on, they spend about one minute.  Oh, here's a little, you know, what's-her-face.  She's beating the crap out of her mother.  What's your name?  Oh, my name's Joe.  Oh, next.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  And then they know the ones that have done well.  And then Sally Jessie's great for this one.  We're going to revisit with this one.  Three months ago, she was on our show, and the ratings went through the roof  because she showed so much camel toe that we're bringing her back. 
[00:15:00]  And then they bring back the bad girl.  Yep.  Oh.  I love the bad girl.  You know, I used to go to a lot of those shows when they were really hot.  Rick was on one.  When are you going to bring that tape in from your Rolanda appearance?  Rick was on Rolanda.  Rolanda.  Telling the whole world that he was never going to get married because he didn't believe in it  because his grandfather had 50 kids.  Well, you want to know, was it Mad Max?  No.  That was me, Dave.  It was Rick.  Anyway, I won't tell once.  You went to a Montel taping. 
[00:15:30]  And it was hilarious because, I mean, you just described it to a team, man.  They had some teary-eyed thing going on on the stage, and he was milking it for all it's worth.  Of course.  And then the camera stopped, you know, to play some commercials.  He starts yelling and screaming at his crew that there's lint on his jacket.  On his jacket?  On his jacket.  He stopped like that.  Of course.  On a dime.  We'll, um, we'll be right back.  And the staff, I'll never forget, they were petrified of this guy, and they're running out. 
[00:16:00]  There was, like, two girls working over his coat jacket with a lint brush.  And then we got back from the commercial break or whatever,  and then it was back to get the teary-eyed stuff on stage.  And, um, that's such a touching story.  We'll, we'll, we'll be right back after these words.  All right, Montel, we're clear in the spot.  Why the hell is that lint on my goddamn jacket?  I don't care if this disabled cracker get me a cracker. 
[00:16:30]  I don't need lint on my goddamn jacket.  And we're back.  We're right back from the touching story.  All right, we have to take a break.  Now, Montel's going to come out.  We need a big hand.  I'm Paul Beccurio, everyone.  When Montel comes back, please don't point out lint on his jacket.  Makes him angry.  You're part of the show, remember.  If you see lint on Montel, please pick it off, okay? 
[00:17:00]  Thank you.  I'm Paul Beccurio.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Monday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Now, back to Opie and Anthony on 96.5 WCMF, Rochester, New York. 
[00:17:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Everything you say is amazing.  I'm a mother break.  I need a little room to say.  I'm a mother break.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Amy, what's up?  I'm really pissed off.  You know, these people come on Maury's show because they have problems.  And y'all can get on the air and talk about them.  What's wrong with you?  Like, so you think Maury's doing some help for them, helping them out? 
[00:18:00]  Well, he's trying to make them feel better.  Amy, you really think that's why Maury's doing that?  Yeah, how is Maury helping these people?  Well, like, not too long ago, there was a little boy on there that had a disease.  What was the disease?  I don't know.  He was miniature for his age.  He wasn't old, was he?  Was he in a little body that looked like an old man, only he was nine years old?  Yes, yes, exactly. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, that was me.  Yeah, right.  Did I have a big light bulb head?  Stop making fun of him.  What's wrong with you?  Get, get, get.  Why do you say?  Why do you want to do that?  Did I have a big light bulb head?  That was just about as fragile as a light bulb?  You did not have a light bulb head, okay?  Have a little fin, as brittle as pretzel rods?  You are so mean.  What is wrong with you?  No, me.  Do you not have anything better to do with your time than talk about people in the air?  Amy, we speak the truth. 
[00:19:00]  Let me tell you something.  What is the disease?  The Pejoria.  Pejoria disease?  That is like, that is the diamond in the rough for these talk shows.  They love it because it's a rare find.  Yeah, that is.  There's not many of those kids around.  That is very rare, and it's big ratings for these talk shows.  You've got to be kidding if you think he's parading them on the stage because he's trying  to help these kids.  Well, he must be if he's willing to carry it on Disney World and give them things.  Come on.  Why will he do that?  Small price to pay.  You send the kid down to Disney World, and your ratings go through the roof. 
[00:19:30]  Figure it out.  He's not freaky looking enough.  Get me one that looks like, that has those buck teeth that look like the big white chicklets.  Not the little mini ones, the big ones.  I just think that's very wrong, and you should not be doing things like that.  Amy, I say that you're really stupid and naive, that you don't get what's going on  with these talk shows.  For one, I am not stupid, and I'm not naive.  Like I said, you're stupid and naive.  Did I look like a big scary pet dispenser?  Listen, y'all are two fucking motherfuckers. 
[00:20:00]  They don't have nothing to do with you.  Better things to do with yourself.  Oh, look at you, you're a potty mouth.  You're a little potty.  You're a little potty mouth, Amy.  Amy, you're a little potty mouth bitch, and I love it.  I'm a bitch.  Excuse me?  I don't do so.  Talk dirty, you little hooah.  Did you pump out one of these distorted kids?  What happened?  Yeah, right.  Did your stepdad get you pregnant when he was banging you, and you pumped out a freak  kid?  Is that what happened, Amy?  I have two beautiful children. 
[00:20:30]  Thank you.  Nothing is wrong with my children.  What's the matter?  Are they mental cases?  Did you have a little projuria kid that really had to squeeze to get that huge head through?  Is that what happened, Amy?  Y'all are retarded, okay?  Y'all are so retarded.  You have a big tongue kid with a mohair cut?  Amy, you truly are stupid if you don't get what the talk shows do.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's right.  Two beautiful children that should beat their mother.  The freakier, the better.  That's what happens on these talk shows.  That's what happens with the Jerry Lewis telethon as well.  Right.  They wheel the freaks out for money. 
[00:21:00]  Isn't that right, Amy?  Y'all are so stupid, okay?  Y'all are so stupid.  Y'all don't even know what it's all about.  Y'all have the lights.  He's on the air.  Look, it's like a taco.  Shut up.  You shut up.  I'll beat you again.  You stupid.  Well, she had the one child for me, and then the other one's Arlo's.  But let me tell you something.  I'll take care of my kids.  You're just a stupid concrete walker.  See, we're the shitty folk now that does that, like, wearing shoes and stuff. 
[00:21:30]  And all that shitty stuff and walking on pavement.  You ever crummy and such moron?  Hang the phone up, you skank.  The little one's got what they call the wall around my brain.  I know you didn't just call me a skank.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  You're the skank, okay?  Hang the phone up, you skank.  There you go.  There she goes.  She's talking to a recording.  One of our friends, Amy.  Wow. 
[00:22:00]  She was fun.  You concrete walker?  Well, I was with Amy back in the sixth grade when I dropped out,  and I've been working at the garage to take care of the kids.  Die, get in the club, and die.  I love when girls call up like that.  You're terrible.  You're stupid.  Shut up.  And then she's defending a show that does worse. 
[00:22:30]  She's pissed at us because we spell it out like it really is.  If we're talking about kids that have the pejoria,  and we're goofing on it on this show, we're awful.  But Maury's doing the same goddamn thing,  and it's worse because he's doing it under a lie,  like he's trying to help.  Please.  Don't even care.  Like you said, those pejoria kids are a rare find.  Where are diamonds in the rough?  Well, the lifespan's very short.  Lifespan's short, so it's not like you can have repeated appearances on. 
[00:23:00]  Not many around.  What about the famous Siamese twin chicks?  Oh, God damn, you're right.  Maury did that, too.  Connected at the head.  Connected at the head, and then under the guise that, you know,  it's all cute and fun, the one wanted to be a country singer.  A country western singer, and they had her sing a song  while her sister's attached to her head.  And everyone, the stupid rubes in the audience,  they didn't even have the balls to say this is ridiculous. 
[00:23:30]  They're all clapping like, oh, wow, she does have talent.  I think we're going to get you a record deal.  No one will notice that her sister's attached to her head.  To her head.  And her sister hates country western music,  but she likes to shop in the mall,  so that's the trade-off, because the other girl doesn't like to shop.  Hey, let's show them footage in the mall shopping, everyone.  You're just two regular girls, aren't you?  Right.  You know what the saddest thing was?  Are you hoping to get a boyfriend?  Just shut up.  Yeah, your hair looks really pretty. 
[00:24:00]  When they tell him stuff like that, it's awful.  These two were connected at the face.  Remember that?  They were connected by eye sockets and skulls,  so that when you're looking at one,  you're looking at the back of the head of the other.  Dude, when you looked at the East Siamese twins,  you wanted to puke.  Yeah.  It was so frightening.  It was really, really fun to look at.  And they're making believe that they're beautiful,  and do you have boyfriends?  No, but we're hoping someday they get married.  People who are watching today might want to, you know, 
[00:24:30]  call up and have a date.  Oh, who the hell am I kidding?  This is horrific, isn't it, people?  But, of course, the talk shows.  They have them on because they're doing good.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's what it is.  I'm the stupid moron.  I forgot.  Her dream is to be a country-western singer,  and who are we to stand in our way and bring her out on the Morrie show?  I won't ask how you wash that connected eye socket.  I know that's a question everyone is really wondering about. 
[00:25:00]  And the one is so stupid,  she really thinks she could be a country-western singer,  so all these bars, they book her.  Oh, yeah.  They're not booking her because she sings well.  It's like, holy ass, we got the freak show in our bar tonight.  Look at this.  Come on down.  Connected at the face, chick.  Budweiser, two for a dollar.  Come on down.  Bring all your friends.  And then the other one is all pissed off because, oh, you know, this is her dream,  so I have to go, you know, I have to hang out.  You've got to go along, yeah.  You know, and I hate country-western music.  The best was the hairstyles. 
[00:25:30]  The one dyed her hair a different color.  And then, I don't, you know, it might not be Morrie.  That's what sucks.  One of those tools are like, oh, look at your hair.  Were you at the beauty parlor before you came over here today?  Beauty parlor?  I just did my hair.  I'm glad you noticed.  One of them dyed her hair a different color and just picked a spot on their heads where  she felt the Mason-Dixon line, Jerry.  Where she figured her hair officially ends in the other one.  The other one starts and just didn't touch the rest of it.  So one has this blonde straight hair.  The other one's going with the basic brown mousy kind of curly thing. 
[00:26:00]  With that border line down her head.  And the one was cursed with legs.  And the other one, you know, she has to wheel the other one around that's placed on the curb.  But they're doing it to help the poor kid.  And you know, you're special girls.  I don't want anyone telling you you're not special girls.  He gets real close.  Holds their hand.  You know something?  The courage you girls have, it's just me. 
[00:26:30]  We'll be right there.  What a great freak show.  All right.  Wheel this piece of, wheel this four-legged piece of crap off my stage.  Get this connected at the head freak mess off my stage.  All right, we're in commercials.  You are disgusting messes.  You know, and Lou makes a great, I should let Lou do it.  Lou, what's up? 
[00:27:00]  Hi.  I just wanted to know if more people...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  If Maury Povich...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  I said Lou.  This is Lou.  Oh, her name's Lou, Louise or something?  Lupita.  Lupita?  Lupita.  You got some of that Hispanic blood in you.  Mexican.  Mexicans.  Just as good.  I love the Mexicans.  All right, go ahead, Lou.  If Maury Povich really cares about these children, then why did he adopt a perfectly normal child?  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, if you really care and want to do something...  Show them, exactly.  Show everybody your causes and what really matters to you.  You know, I don't care that he does this type of programming.  I've got to keep saying it, but let's not make believe that you're doing it for this reason when you're actually doing it for ratings.  I wanted to adopt a six-headed mongloid freak, but Connie wasn't into it.  Yeah.  A bunch of hypocrites.  What about the other funny twins?  They...  They... 
[00:28:00]  What are you laughing at, man?  You've got to be talking about crab guys.  The crab guys.  Crab guys.  I knew you were going to be talking about crab guys.  Crab guys.  I think they were from Chicago.  They rocked.  This is the sickest, freakiest thing.  And the goddamn PC people out there ruined their careers.  Yeah.  This is something else that has to be brought up.  I think it was the HBO show Freaks.  Freaks.  Because they had the half-woman.  Remember the half-woman?  Yeah.  I know I'm all over the place now.  I love half-woman.  Half-woman was basically cut right below her boobs. 
[00:28:30]  The sternum.  Yeah.  Belly button, let's say.  There was nothing there.  No parts.  She had no sexual organs whatsoever.  It was about the belly button.  That was it.  But she walked on her hands, and her stump body only came down to her elbow.  They showed her.  She was a checkout girl at the local supermarket because she can't work the freak shows anymore.  That's right.  And she was cursing the politically correct people out there.  Because they took her livelihood away from her.  She didn't mind being a freak in these side shows. 
[00:29:00]  They started protesting the places that were having the freak shows.  She was married to Alligator Man.  Right.  Alligator guy.  What was his name?  Alligator Man?  I think one Alligator Man was married to a hairy woman.  Oh, hairy.  Wolf woman.  Oh, no, no.  She was married.  Half woman was married to one of those tall guys, like tall man.  Right.  Tall man.  And they had the wedding and stuff.  They had wedding pictures of tall guy and half girl.  Right.  But who was the one we saw?  Oh, the crab guys.  Crab guys.  They were connected.  They worked at freak shows forever, and there's no more freak shows. 
[00:29:30]  Get where these guys were connected from.  One guy, I guess they split, they were a single body right to, I guess, the waist and up to  the chest.  So they kind of hung off of each other in the upper part.  Then it was a single body during the midsection part of the body.  But then they had four legs.  So they showed them, this was great.  They showed them playing baseball.  They were playing frigging baseball.  One is hitting, one's catching. 
[00:30:00]  Well, and their normal brother was pitching.  So the one kid would, the one kid, the one twin would hit, but the other guy was catching,  and he wouldn't let him run.  So he never got the first base, and he would take him out.  And the guy's like there, just to throw the ball to him, he makes the tag.  How do you throw home when the guy's round and third?  You just got to throw it to the guy that's connected to the runner.  But the best part was, the way the legs were going, four legs running wildly with a single 
[00:30:30]  body and two heads.  It was the freakiest looking thing.  It looked like a crab boy.  Wait a minute.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they had like the two heads and four arms.  You scared me, because we've got to move on to the next one that I just was reminded of.  Which one?  The, you know, and we'll get crucified for this one.  And you're a special couple of brothers.  We'll get crucified for this one, because they're cute.  Yeah, who? 
[00:31:00]  The two-headed girl.  Two-headed girl.  Oh, man.  Two-headed girl.  This single body, single legs, just two legs, single body just splits like at the neckline.  Where they have only...  Apparently splits.  Right, right.  It's two heads on a body that almost looks normal.  The shoulders are a little wide.  The shoulders are a little big, because there's two people, you know, squeezed together there.  But two arms, two legs, two heads.  Two heads.  Two heads. 
[00:31:30]  And they're running around playing soccer and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Freaky looking.  And then, I'm sorry, you start thinking about dating implications.  When you have a single...  Help me out.  It was like, it was either 2020, 2020 downtown, one of them, and they're having a serious interview  with these two about dating and stuff.  Did a whole thing on them.  But when you're thinking, that's a single vag they got.  Single vag, yeah.  One.  Then they got two heads.  Yeah.  With two separate brains in them.  Like, the whole thing here is way out there. 
[00:32:00]  What do you do?  Do you get jealous?  If you're the one head that's dating a guy, right?  And you want the action.  And you're connected mentally in a relationship with the guy.  Right.  And you want to have some action.  Right.  Now...  But your bitch, Siamese twin, is the prude and she wants to be a virgin her whole life.  Right.  Now what happens?  And then just the fact that...  You're having great sex and the other girl is going to take you up on rape charges.  Or how about the fact that maybe the other head likes the guy too.  Now the two heads are jealous of one another because, hey, that's my guy. 
[00:32:30]  But they share the common vag.  Maybe you've got to flip a coin and figure out, all right, you get the balloon knot, I get the vag.  And that's how they determine who's the guy having sex with who.  And then what if you've got two guys, okay?  Two guys, you're each dating a head, right?  You're going to feel a little funky that the one guy is banging your chick.  Are you with me on this?  I lost you somewhere, Ed. 
[00:33:00]  Hello?  I lost you somewhere.  You've got two guys.  Two guys.  One guy's dating one head.  Sure.  Another guy's dating another head.  Okay.  Now you're going out on a date.  One guy's going out on a date, right?  He bangs the chick.  Now the other guy comes over to pick up his date.  He's getting sloppy seconds.  I think the guy gets pissed off at the other guy because he's banging his girlfriend.  Exactly.  Okay.  What dictates?  That's why I think the one head picks the balloon knot.  The other head picks the front door.  That's exclusive to them. 
[00:33:30]  And then as far as the hummers go, what if one of the girls loves men and the other likes  bulldogs?  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  Or how about the one head is given a hummer.  Yeah.  And the other one's just got to stare at his balloon knot the whole time.  See, those are the questions I want answers to.  I don't care how they ride a bike.  Instead, are you guys hoping to go to the prom?  You're a special two-headed thing. 
[00:34:00]  Those are the questions I would spend hours getting the answers to.  It truly is an amazing story.  Yeah.  They jump in the pool.  Oh, my God.  And they had to learn because the one head knows how to swim and the other didn't.  No, no.  The one head works the right side of the body and the other head works the left side and  they could still run and stuff.  Yeah, they had a coordinator.  They were on a bike.  Yeah.  Oh, freaky.  Too freaky.  But it's all those weird sex questions that I need answers to. 
[00:34:30]  Now, the head.  Which head are you going out with?  Oh, man.  And then, like, what?  You grab an ass with her?  I can understand the two guys dating the two heads at the same time.  You just put your arm around your respective head, right?  And you're walking down.  You know, you're at the mall.  The two guys.  The two heads.  But then, you know, you want to do a little ass grabbing.  You know, the guy's going to get pissed off.  You're grabbing his chick's ass. 
[00:35:00]  Is it just exclusively you get the right cheek and he gets the left cheek?  How about this one?  Okay, you got to see.  What?  I got to be very careful here.  Okay.  Which girl wipes?  Oh.  Yeah.  I would think, are they right-handed and left-handed?  No, they'd be both because the one is right-handed and the one is left-handed.  They'd just alternate.  So they get in arguments, though, like it's your turn?  I ain't touching. 
[00:35:30]  I ain't going to clean up that mess.  Why did you eat this?  Now we have the squirts.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I lived in Redding, Pennsylvania, which is where the girls that were connected at the head are from.  All right, so now we're going back a few twins ago now.  Where they're attached at the head and the one wants to be the country western singer.  Yeah, well, I used to be walking around the mall with my mom.  I was like 10, 12 years old, something like that.  And we would see these girls, and my mom would be like, Mike, don't stare. 
[00:36:00]  Don't stare.  Whatever you do, don't stare.  You got to stare.  I know.  I mean, it was like the freakiest thing I've ever seen.  I mean, it's not every day that you're walking through the mall, you see this girl with this.  It looked like she was pushing around like a walker.  And she had this other girl sitting on top of it.  It was the freakiest thing I've ever seen.  She's on a gurney.  Yeah.  I mean, it was disturbing.  I love the people like, don't stare.  We're human beings.  We have to stare.  No, let's just make sure you don't stare at these people, because they're special people.  You shouldn't be staring. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, we're in a commercial?  Roll this freak show away from me.  I'm going to puke.  Hey, Larry, who are you having on your show tonight?  Yeah, I know.  Larry King.  Yeah, okay.  Eh, whatever.  Don't you hate it when I sound like Maury?  All right, Mike, thank you.  All right, thanks.  You guys suck.  Ryan, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Did you guys see the Maury one with the bodybuilding midget who was there to cheer up the Progeria  kids?  Was it the midget or it was a kid? 
[00:37:00]  No, the guy who was a midget was a bodybuilder.  And he met the Progeria.  They were twin boys.  He met them at some kind of a freak convention.  And he was there to cheer them up.  That's great.  They met, like, I don't know, they were friends.  Yeah, what is he going to do to cheer up the kids?  Yeah, it's cheering me up.  I'm nine years old and I've got the body of a 96-year-old and I'm going to die in about  ten minutes.  But I'm cheered up.  Thank you.  Well, what I want to know is how does that benefit society, having a bodybuilding midget 
[00:37:30]  to your Progeria kids on a TV show?  Ah, that's just lumping all the freaks together.  Because then after you have, like, the midgets on and the Progeria kids and stuff, then you  work the combinations.  It's like you get the half woman with the Progeria kid and, you know, throwing some  Siamese twins.  You've got ratings, my friend.  You can mix and match them, people.  Mix and match your freak shows.  Look at this.  We've got a Progeria kid and a goddamn weightlifting midget.  Me, darling. 
[00:38:00]  Be watching, Maury Bovich, people.  You're going to see freak shows.  Look at this.  We've got Siamese twins bitches connected at the skulls.  And they're a country western singer.  Where are you going to find stuff like this?  Look at the Progeria kid aging as we speak.  Be watching.  Be watching.  Be watching.  Freak show, people.  Open up your own side show.  Open up your own side show. 
[00:38:30]  Look at the no-body chick walking on her hands.  That's got to be something.  And she got married for the big tall guy.  And she's got no lower organs.  And on that HBO freak show, I think she said how she's pissed off at the politically correct  people out there.  Took away her livelihood.  She better just stay under the covers at all times in bed with the guy.  Just latch on like one of those sucker fishes.  Because first of all, I don't want to see you.  You know, there's a town in Florida.  Second of all, hey, it's all you can do, really. 
[00:39:00]  You know, there's a town in Florida that's where all the freaks live from the old side shows.  It's Freakville or whatever the hell it is.  Who the hell's the man?  Lobster boy?  Yeah, he's got the claws.  Lobster boy.  The official lobster boy got shot by his own family.  Got the claws.  And then there's the wolf woman who...  I think wolf woman died recently.  She did.  She did.  She started shaving, by the way.  Yes, she did.  Because she's a normal lady.  Go to the special woman with hair.  Oh, boy. 
[00:39:30]  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Make wish foundation national.  This place is old.  When you help me.  A wish comes true.  Sorry about that, old.  How can I help you?  Hi.  This is John Huber. 
[00:40:00]  I was told to call back after the holidays.  Make wishes happen for sick kids.  Right.  How can we help you?  Well, son Jonathan is dying.  What state does he live in?  New Hampshire.  Okay, one moment.  He's going to give you his local make-wish chapter.  Yeah, do you do things with celebrities?  Yes.  Where they can meet their celebrities and stuff?  Mm-hmm.  We sure do.  Let me give you a phone number. 
[00:40:30]  Are you ready?  Yeah.  He wants to meet Pamela Lay from Baywatch.  Okay.  Well, let me give you the phone number to the chapter that would help him.  Do you think that's a possibility?  Um, it depends on, you know, there's a lot of things that it would depend on, but first  of all, let's get you going on his local chapter.  They're the ones that would be working with him.  All right.  Well, it's just a simple request.  Oh, yeah.  Um, I mean, Jonathan just wants to see, um, uh, Pam. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  Okay, let me give you this phone number to call.  Let's see, Pam, uh, giving me oral favors before he dies.  Okay.  Hold on.  It's a gift of luck.  Okay, um, let me give you this phone number.  You think that would be possible?  It might be, but you need to get it going, so let's give you this phone number and give  them a call.  Okay.  It's area code 603. 
[00:41:30]  So you honestly think that he could see Pamela giving me a b****?  What?  That's right.  Hello?  Next Monday on the Opie and Anthony Show, Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  96.5 WCMF, Rochester, New York.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony. 
[00:42:00]  WCMF.  Rocks.  So how was your Thanksgiving, Anthony?  Ah, you know, spent a little time with the family, Opie.  Sure.  Over at Grandma's for the big, uh, you know, Italian, uh, Thanksgiving.  Very nice.  All the food that you could feed an army with, and, uh, I was right up there.  Right at the, uh, next to the head of the table.  Uh-huh.  I made it all the way up.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Felt pretty good, uh, because my brother wasn't there this year.  He, uh, he was over at his in-laws. 
[00:42:30]  Ah.  So I got to move up into the Joe seat.  So there I was, like, right at the, before the head of the table.  I looked down at the little card table at the end, remembering years and years ago when I was there.  And I had to worry, I remember the middle of the table.  Sure.  I remember when I became a, a, uh, teenager and worked my way up from the card table to the real table, but way at the, the card table end.  Well, how many people had to die in your family to get that space?  Oh, quite a few.  Okay. 
[00:43:00]  Quite a few.  And then, uh, you know, I worked my way up, and as I was sitting there, next to the head of the table, thinking there's only one more place to go, you start feeling, uh, old.  Old.  Yeah, of course you do.  Old is what you start feeling.  Do you have any teenagers in your family?  Yeah.  So are you, like, the cool uncle where you, you know, go get them high and stuff in the coat room?  Oh, no, no.  Give them a little sip or two here or there?  They're like early teens, RJ and Chris.  Oh, all right.  They're pissing, cool.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, they idolize me.  It's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm cursing, like, a banshee at the table and stuff, and they're just like, you are so cool.  You were drunk again.  You were drunk again, obviously.  Well, a couple of beers, though.  You know.  Not as drunk as my mom.  So, so you're cool?  My, my mom was at the point, uh, she was at the I love you, F you stage.  Really?  Yeah, she gets like that every so often on the holidays.  Was she snotted?  Uh, she was, ooh, drinking her wine.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, sitting there at the table.  All of a sudden, uh, and then you bring up the last time we were all hanging out as 
[00:44:00]  a family and she was hitting the wine.  And she's like, oh, scratch your ass.  I wasn't saying that.  I don't do that.  Because we tell her, when she really gets schnockered, she'll say, uh, she'll talk to you and it's  like, oh, baby, my, my son, it's so good to see you again.  You're like, Ma, calm down.  Oh, F you, F you, F you.  No, but I love you.  I love you.  It's so good to see you again.  All right, Ma, look, I'm going to go into the kitchen.  I'm going, oh, don't leave.  F you, F you.  And it's not F you. 
[00:44:30]  It's the F word.  Well, Coke will do that to you.  Oh, Jesus.  You're saying my mom's doing Coke?  Oh, for you.  Well, I'm just assuming at this point.  No, she's drinking some wine.  And having a good time with the family.  Could be acid.  Then we tell her that, you know, last time we were all together as a family, you got  that I love you, F you face.  And she's like, oh, no, I wasn't.  An hour later, I love you, F you face.  And then she's bringing up, you know, school, when I was in school. 
[00:45:00]  She goes, remember the time I got you that lovely fur coat?  Fur coat?  Fur coat.  She brought this up.  I forgot about it.  Elementary school.  Did it go with your velour shirt that's on the FM Talk website?  Dude, I don't know what kind of.  You were like a pimp when you were eight years old.  I wish I was as cool as a pimp when I was in that grade.  But it turned out all I was was an elementary school kid going to elementary school in a fur coat.  My mother's like, oh, it kept you warm.  I go, no, the coat didn't. 
[00:45:30]  The blood running from my nose over my body kept me warm because I'd be beat up.  Because, faggot.  Hey, Anthony, you're a faggot.  Only faggots and women wear fur coats.  I don't know what kind of dope she was doing.  She comes home one day from the store.  I'm just thinking, I want a snorkel jacket like all the other kids had in school.  But, no, my mother says, you know, you ever see on the sidelines of the football games,  Joe Namath wears a fur coat.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Namath wears a fur coat. 
[00:46:00]  Joe Namath was also a quarterback for the Jets at the time.  You know, pretty cool job.  So he could pretty much wear whatever the hell he wanted.  Right.  He's not in grade.  People are going to still hang out with him.  Right.  Exactly.  You know.  Who's that other big, the big black guy that had the daughter in the films, the football player?  He used to crochet on the sidelines.  Greer.  Rosie Greer.  Sure.  He would crochet on the sidelines.  Right?  Right.  Anybody going to crack him in the head?  Hey, Rosie, you faggot.  Of course not. 
[00:46:30]  If I was to crochet in fifth grade, what would happen to me?  You wear a fur coat.  It doesn't matter.  Joe Namath wears one on the sidelines.  I was being beat up because Mom got me a fur coat.  She was always, she was like a head of the trend and like she was going to make us, we  were models.  Fashion models.  A fur coat.  Give me my snorkel jacket.  By the time you were in ninth grade, were you dressing like Clyde Frazier?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted jeans. 
[00:47:00]  I wanted a t-shirt.  I wanted sneakers.  Like I dressed now.  So she brought up the fur coat at the Thanksgiving Day table.  Yeah.  Right.  And I totally forgot about it.  But, yes, she had gotten me a fur coat.  All those little family memories come up in Thanksgiving.  Things you wish, never remember again.  But another thing, like sneakers, I always wanted the, what were they?  The Pia Flyer high top black sneakers.  Those are the ones I want. 
[00:47:30]  You look like a hoodlum.  You wear those.  You look like a hoodlum.  You want to look like one of those.  And then she'd use the N word and stuff.  Oh, she would?  You know, Italian.  So, you know.  Hey, come on.  She's older now.  She goes to church.  She goes to church now.  Come on.  That was a long time ago.  But I wanted to wear the high top black Pia Flyer sneakers.  And my mother would always come back with those stupid white skippies, you know.  The stupid sneakers with the rubber front and everything. 
[00:48:00]  Your typical Wonder Years sneakers.  Sure.  You know.  And I was pissed.  And pants.  I wanted jeans.  I wanted to go to school in jeans.  She'd get me like dress slacks.  Just your slacks.  And a dress shirt.  And a tie for the first day of school.  I'm there with a briefcase.  I swear to God.  You would think I was closing deals for IBM the way she dressed me to go off to the fifth grade.  I had a briefcase.  And a shirt.  Matching shirt and tie.  Which my brother had to wear the exact same thing. 
[00:48:30]  Are we twins?  No.  No.  But she dressed us like we were.  So now everyone thought you were twins.  Right.  And we had to have the same little ties and pants and shoes.  One time in her disco diva phase, she bought me platform shoes.  Dude.  Platform shoes.  Disco shoes.  I had the big platform shoes.  I swear I had eight inch platform. 
[00:49:00]  I looked like that jerk off in Saturday Night Fever.  Tony, are you going to call me Tony?  Tony, give me a call.  She's pregnant, Father.  You think the Pope could get her an abortion, Father?  Tony, you didn't even call me.  Look, Tony, I'm dancing, Tony.  I'm dancing on the bridge, Tony.  I had those big comfy shoes.  That's classic.  And then one time, my sister's dogs.  She had two little dogs. 
[00:49:30]  Eight.  The shoes.  Yeah, baby.  That was me.  She, my sister's dog ate the heels of the shoes, the big platform shoes.  I was like, thank you.  That extra can of kennel ration for you.  Back to my skippies.  That's why I dressed like this.  Because for years I couldn't.  I wanted jeans, sneakers, and a t-shirt my whole frigging life.  So now, I wear what I want.  And then I go to Thanksgiving dressed the same way.  And my mom's like, it looks like a flop. 
[00:50:00]  I was like, oh, sorry, I don't have my platform disco shoes and fur coat, Mom.  So you could have got the fur coat out of the closet for you.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Looked like I'm coming out of the closet with that frigging thing on.  But her big excuse was, Joe Namath wore a fur coat on the sidelines, walking back and forth.  Remember when he was injured a lot of times?  And he had that wacky coat.  Yeah, he was still like on the field and stuff.  He walked back and forth the sidelines.  He had this big fur coat.  But he could pull off that look, man.  He had the blondes by his side. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, two people pulled off that look.  And there were stories in the paper how he's banging broads in between quarters and stuff.  Joe Namath and Fred Mertz.  Remember that when he put the big coat on?  We're going to 23 skidoo.  Hey, Apple, let's jitterbug.  I'm going to get some broads with this coat.  Come on, Rick.  He had a big furry bear coat.  That's what I looked like.  So was your childhood idol Joe Namath?  Yeah, you know.  Were you wearing pantyhose like him, too? 
[00:51:00]  He did do the commercial for the pantyhose.  No, thank God my mother didn't feel I should be wearing pantyhose.  All right.  Let's go to Caesar.  Caesar, what's going on today?  Anthony, you are a homo, man.  Oh, come on.  Listen, did Mama also buy the little fox skin scarf to match the coat?  No, there was no fox skin scarf.  Yes, there's a little mink scarf.  I bet you.  I'm admitting it was a gay coat.  She put me on a fag gay coat in elementary school where, gee, people aren't judging you  too much by what you look like. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, buddy, I bet she tied the mittens to the sleeve of the coach, too.  No, it wasn't that drastic.  You're a faggot, man.  I had the big dopey, like, galoshes and stuff.  I wanted, like, fireman boots, you know?  Things with the big metal clips.  Sure.  Yeah.  I kept the totes.  Totes galoshes.  Put on your rubbers.  You were obviously poor, like myself, growing up.  No, she did pretty good, you know?  I mean, it was all...  No, she was more...  Like, she would spend more to make me look like an asshole. 
[00:52:00]  Now I know why Boomer beat you up in elementary school.  Yeah, exactly.  She had your cute little fur coat on.  My fur coat.  I wanted a bomber jacket, you know?  I wanted regular high-topia flyer sneakers, jeans, just looking like a kid.  Uh-huh.  But no, my mother figures she's dressing me up like I'm in GQ or something.  GQ?  Well, that's what they would.  They would put stupid things like fur coats on the models and stuff.  And she would see it and go, oh, that's a great look.  She used to dress me up like that. 
[00:52:30]  She was goofing on me because she said over Thanksgiving, she said, well, when you dress  yourself, you look ridiculous.  What do you mean?  And she pulls out pictures of me with striped pants and a plaid shirt.  I'm walking around like that.  I'm like, so that doesn't go, I'm like, I don't care if it went or not.  That's the 70s look, though.  That stuff went in the 70s.  Just like Greg Brady.  Haven't you seen the Brady Bunch?  They say it's in.  I remember going for back-to-school shopping and stuff.  You know, you go to the department store and walk around and you'd see stuff you want. 
[00:53:00]  You're like, oh, that's good.  That's good.  Oh, no, that's crap.  That's what the lowlifes are wearing.  You know, Charles Nelson Reilly is wearing a scarf off to the right.  Oh.  You should wear that.  Yeah.  I can't see that.  Oh.  If there's a picture with you with Charles Nelson Reilly's scarf, I need to see that.  Where's my scarf?  Oh.  Oh.  The ghost and Mrs. Muir.  Oh.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Oh. 
[00:53:30]  I'll tell you one thing.  If she would have bought me that coat when I was like 13, 14, I'd have banged it.  What's with the fur on this coat, Anthony?  Why?  It's like Liberty Spikes at the punk rock.  More girls, more gooders.  Hookers for everyone.  You'll have it.  Oh.  Opie and Anthony.  No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused.

[00:59:30]  Galleons.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  For many years, you know I've had a drink problem, and I'm trying to battle that problem every single day.  But one thing I don't do, I don't drive my car when I'm drinking.  I get someone to drive me.  Do not drink and drive.  It's the stupidest thing.  If you drink, just don't drive.  Not only are you going to hurt yourself, you may hurt some other person.  and you wouldn't want that on your country, would you?  Everyone at Ray Sands Glass reminds you of the three most important things 
[01:00:00]  to remember for the upcoming holiday season.  Family, family, and family.  Hey, you're just as important to your family as they are to you,  so please drive with extra caution and make this a safe holiday season.  Remember to wear your seatbelts,  use only hands-free cellular phones while driving,  and never, never drink and drive.  You can have fun without putting yourself or someone else at risk.

Alright, you got that  Oh man, the boy's in the band  You got that part, right?  Rusty Trombone?  Well, no, no  Not completely  No, not completely  See, that's just the mouthpiece part  I understand  Of the trombone  Right  Then you need the reach around  Wait a minute  I got it  I'm with you  I'm in tune  You got it?  Where does Rusty come in? 
[01:06:00]  Well  What do you think?  What do you think things would look like  After you're done playing it?

She walked in  I saw her unloading  Beep, beep, beep, beep  And I was standing there going  They can't be hers  She must be a cobbler or something  600 pairs  I have one pair of Shaquille O'Neal high tops  Hanging in there like in the closet  Right  And they're screaming  Oh, no, no, no  Hell, no  This ain't pay last  This is my house  Oh, she's got them hanging in these clear 
[01:07:00]  Condo high-rise shoe condominiums  So she can see all the different kind of shoes  They're all black  But she needs to see the different kind of shoes she's got  I can't believe this  I don't get the ladies in their shoes  It's like I have three little birds outside the window  When I go to sleep  They turn into elves  They make shoes  They go back  I'm living in a fairy tale  But I tell you what  You know what else has happened  I used to have this habit  Of getting up in the middle of the night  And just peeing by sonar 
[01:07:30]  Right  You just go till you hear water  Right  That's got to change  Oh, yeah  They get a little mad at that  Oh, yeah  She's like, what are you?  I'm a dolphin  It's a dolphin, huh?  Oh, Christ  Wow, how about that?  Jesus  Living together  It's a big adjustment  It sounds serious  I know  Yeah  A lot of my stuff didn't make it in the transfer  I was going to ask about that 
[01:08:00]  What did you lose?  Pretty much what I thought was furniture  Right  Which she actually couldn't describe  Because the biggest phrase she had is  What is that?  It's a couch  It was  It's my stop sign  Yeah, not there  Oh, God  All that other stuff  You hang posters up with tape?  Yeah  I'm like, well  How nuts am I?  You know  Crazy me  Had I known Velcro was available  I mean, why not?  And then  And I  Every time she says 
[01:08:30]  You know, I was thinking  That means I either have to move, paint, or buy something  Every action has a reaction  Sure  She goes  I'm not living in a dorm room  I go  Neither am I  Yes, you are  I said  Well, I'm pretty comfortable here  Sure  I want  And the hair  There's a lot of hair products  Have you noticed the hair products?  Yeah  Now, how many do you have, like, as far as bottles and puffs and scrubs?  Well, there's all kinds of stuff in the shower  Yeah 
[01:09:00]  Oh, the shower's a nightmare  But let me tell you something  I never before have I ever exfoliated  But I prefer the glycogen wash to the pumice coat  When you exfoliate?  Oh, yeah  I had no idea the layers  And my cuticle  Never once has my consciousness been raised to look at my nails  I didn't even know what they were  I just knew if you pull them, they bleed  So I never touched them before  Right  But now I've got to know  What, you've got to go get them done  And you've got to push that skin on the nail up  Yeah, sure  Because if you don't, you know 
[01:09:30]  You're a Cro-Manian man  How could you go out in public with those digits and the shape they're in?  Oh, my God  That's what he actually said  You know, why don't we go  We'll go to the manicurist  I go, what do you mean, we?  What is this plural thing?  He goes, look at the cuticle  I go, I don't  What?  That's a cuticle?  Don't pull it  It'll bleed  Some adjustments to make there, pal 
[01:10:00]  Huge, my friend  Huge  You've been a bachelor for many years  I know, I had to box up the porn  That was sick  I didn't throw it away, though  Because I like it  I put it out in the garage  And she's like, where are you going?  Going to work on a car  We don't have a car  Yeah, I know  But you do have the trim there readily available  Oh, sure  You know, you reach over, it's right there  Well, let me tell you something  Now, with this girl 
[01:10:30]  It cuts down a lot of stress and aggravation  Now I'm not getting laid  But I know from who  Usually you walk around the bar and go  Which one of these girls ain't going to sleep with me?  Now I just know the one that ain't going to sleep with me  There you go  You know, when you go to bed at night  And you lean over and you start kissing her and everything  And you're trying to be real tender and stuff  The last thing you want to hear is  Again?  Oh, okay  Ouch 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, don't you  I worry  I'm like, maybe there's something wrong with me  I was actually thinking of you  I mean, I'm like a hormone with feet  Adam, welcome to the world of living together  Yeah, well, you guys  And I have no warning from you two  No, no  I know you guys were sitting there going  Oh, let him find out on his own  Why?  Because he'll call up Rant and that's why  So what does she do to chip in? 
[01:11:30]  What do you mean to chip in?  Is she cooking or something?  There's food in the fridge now  I'm eating with a fork  The clothes are from Banana Republic  I get rid of the Rick Springfield hockey hair  Apparently the bi-level do is out  So a lot of changes have been made  This is too funny  What are you doing, a one-man show?  Oh, yeah, tonight is our closing night of a cold 
[01:12:00]  How about that?  One-man show  Yeah, well, hopefully we'll take it to New York  Whoopi Ferrara  Whoopi Ferrara  I got news for you  But this Joe Papp crap ain't for me, man  Running around producing plays and stuff  I'm a comic  I wake up at noon, I stretch  I need a nap  And I go back to bed  That'll end, too, pal  Oh, you tell me about it  There are plans to be made  And things to do  Oh, God, they always have to do things  They're like worker hands  You know, they've got to, like, move stuff 
[01:12:30]  And don't put anything down  I had a cup of coffee  I put it down  I picked up the phone  I came back  Where's the coffee?  I cleaned it  Why did you clean it?  I wasn't done  Well, why'd you leave it there?  Because I don't have a clip on my forehead  Oh, man  Wow  I like my stuff out in the open  It's like, sure  Women have to scurry things away  Does Jen have to put things away?  I like to walk around going  I like to put all my stuff out in front of me 
[01:13:00]  So I can walk around goose-stepping  Looking at all my possessions  All your goods  Yes, fine  This is me  I'm the merchant of Venice  All these possessions are mine  Yeah  They like putting things away  Yeah, and the question  Is that where this belongs?  Oh, great  Now it's an IQ test  Round peg, round hole  Did I do good?  You know what else is good?  I've noticed this from personal experience  Sometimes they will leave something where it is 
[01:13:30]  Just to see how long you'll leave it there  And then the longer it goes on  The bigger the payoff will be  When they finally mention it  I'm going downstairs  That glass on your night table  Has been there for two weeks  Oh, yeah  I put a lump of coal on your night table  It's now a diamond  It's like, I didn't notice it there  Yeah  For two weeks  Obviously you knew when it was there for a day  Yeah, then you put it down  You're going downstairs  Why don't you take it?  Yeah  Oh, apparently 
[01:14:00]  To myself I said that  Yes  Perfect  Really?  Yes  I'll take it right down  The good crystal?  Oh  Our own Rick here  I heard  Congratulations  What's the countdown, Rick?

[01:16:30]  With child-bearing hips and a pink sublass  And make her your wife and lover with love so true  Now some rivers run high, some rivers run low  When her river runs red, then she's starting her flow  And it's called menstruation  Here's what it means to you  You will notice her bloomers are spotty at first  Stand back, her ovarian dam's gonna burst 
[01:17:00]  Son, don't be afraid, it's a natural thing  Just wad up some cotton and hand her a string  And put the old linens on top of the bed  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead  Under the years old  That's why bloomers  Aye  Aye  She'll retain her water, her breasts will be tender  Say something nice and you're sure to offend her  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead 
[01:17:30]  She'll want to make love if you do  You're a fool, you'll only end up with a bloody old tool  Now get out of the house, go down to the old pub instead  She'll want you to sample the fruit of her loins  But son, it'll taste like some old rusty coin  So turn off the light and take off your hat  And drop to your knees, say a prayer to St. Pat  That'll give you the strength to get out of the bed  And for Ireland's sake, go down to the old pub instead  I feel a solo coming on 
[01:18:00]  So that's right here, Anthony  Very good  Now the pub is the place where the lads are a-meeting  When the moon is full and the gals are a-bleeding  The Catholic, the Protestant, even the pagan  The pub is the place when your lady is ragging  So drink of your pint, boys, and thank your shamrocks

I've been a cracker-free zone for many years  I was just up there  Let's see, when was I up in Harlem?  Rick makes a good point  Friday  Friday, on my way up to Massachusetts  Because I had to cut through Harlem  How many red lights did you go through?  I don't pay attention to traffic signals up there  I don't pay attention to roads  I will drive on the sidewalk  I mean, I'm going up on the sidewalk at one point  There's some woman who's like  Whoa, my baby, look out for my stroller 
[01:20:30]  Crazy ass, hog ass cracker  And he's like, whoa, look out  You can't even tell where the roads are  Oh, my God  I had, like, the whole front of my grill  Was Colt 45 labels  From when I was just going through garbage pails and stuff  Why?  Why?  Rick makes a good point about the Million Youth March  It's going to start at 11 a.m.  And it's going to be done at 11.01  Wow  As soon as Khalid Muhammad opens his damn mouth  And we must kill the light 
[01:21:00]  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop  Whoop, whoop  All right, everybody, disperse  What did he say last year?  He said, grab the cops' guns and use them against them  How is this guy getting another permit?  Right  If somebody can say that  And then you wonder why cops shoot  This guy was telling people  If the cops come in to break up the controlled riot  I can't say, I don't know what the hell  To grab their guns and use them against the cops 
[01:21:30]  Yeah  What the  How do you say that  And then the next year you're granted another permit?  Freedom of speech, Anthony  Unbelievable  Hallelujah  Freedom of speech  And Khalid's like, yeah  My brothers, yeah, rise up, rise up, grab the gun  Ooh, the cops be here, let me run out the back  Where I won't be seen for months  The guy disappeared  Oh, man  Reverend Al staying away, too?  Yeah  He makes all the black leaders of the 60s and 70s really proud 
[01:22:00]  Doesn't he?  Oh, my God  Khalid Muhammad  Khalid Muhammad  I don't know  You won't  Guess where I won't be Saturday  Come on  Malcolm X Boulevard  Yes  Malcolm X Boulevard  All right, Vanjie  We love Vanjie  Oh, wait, I didn't go to Vanjie  Hold on  Vanjie, who lives in Harlem  On the line  Vanjie, what's up?  Yeah, hi, how you doing?  All right  We haven't talked to each other in a long time 
[01:22:30]  But  Uh-oh, you sound upset, Vanjie  No, like, first of all  Why are you talking about, like, we got country roads up here?  What, where did you go through?  No, it's not country roads  I think you missed the point  Um, no  Wait, wait, no  I'll be completely honest with you  When, when, uh, um  A white person like Michelle  I'll speak for Michelle  Uh-huh  Go ahead, Opie  When I'm driving through Harlem  Yeah  I am scared S-less  Why?  So what I do  And, and, and Anthony does it too 
[01:23:00]  We drive through red lights and get the hell out  Well, what  Because I don't understand  Because I don't understand it  You know what  There's part of the  Let me, let me fill, let me fill you in  There's part of the, um  You know that, that white conspiracy?  What white conspiracy?  Well, there's a white conspiracy  Oh  Against black people, remember?  Oh, yeah  See, part of it is  We can run through red lights in black neighborhoods  And we just wink at the cops  And they let us off the hook  Oh, I see  I'm sorry I had to fill you in on that one  Oh, I didn't hear that  But that's part of the white conspiracy  Oh 
[01:23:30]  But what streets are you going through  That you're so terrified?  You know, when I'm going, like, uh  You know, back up to Boston to visit and stuff  I just can never find that damn FDR, man  Oh  All of a sudden I'm, like, on first ab or something  I'm like  Well, there's got to be an exit for the FDR around here somewhere  Oh, no, I'm in the hundreds  Oh, no  Listen, guys  Oh, my God  That's 138th Street  How'd I get up here?  Right  Hey, this don't look like Midtown anymore 
[01:24:00]  Where are the people in the business suits?  Right  But listen  Oh, that's a paranoia that goes through your head  I'm just being honest with you, Pansy  I really don't know why  Because you go from east to west on 125th Street  It's all stores  You've got Starbucks, Pathmark, and all that stuff  And it's nice  So I don't know why you should be terrified  I don't see the stores  Because the hour I drive past  All those big grates are down in front of the windows 
[01:24:30]  Uh-huh  And stuff  You know, because they pull down the big locked grates  Yeah  So I don't know  I swear, I was driving through there Friday  It looked like a scene out of my video game Kingpin  That I was playing  Like, it just looked frightening  You guys exaggerate  Benji, but we're just being honest  I swear, there's not much of a bit here  This is what we do  The funniest line is Anthony going  Oh, my  That's 120th Street  Aw, now I'm up in the hundreds  What happened?  Right  Where's the bridge, for God's sake? 
[01:25:00]  Right  I've got to cross a bridge to safety  Well, listen  I need safety  Next time if you come up here  I'll escort you through  Will you?  And you can walk through  And nobody will bother  I would like to try that  But I'm telling you  I'm paranoid  I mean, there's white people  That live up here  I don't care  What's that?  There's white people that live up here  Oh, no, there's not  Yes, there is  Asians, too  You stopped spreading that wrong  Oh, come on  For real  You know that  Yeah, they're called pimps  No  Wow 
[01:25:30]  You're crossing the line  Isn't that terrible?  Oh, that was just a joke  No  You know something  I don't know much about Harlem  Because any time I've been up there  It's been at night  When I'm driving to get to a bridge  And I don't really stop and look around  Believe me  And I don't make any eye contact  And I leave about five car lengths in front of me  Just in case I've got to make one of them quick getaway  Uh-huh  Just in case someone, you know  Right  Get out the core  You know? 
[01:26:00]  I know, but it's not that bad  Get out the core  Well, there's a difference, though  Because, I don't know, right  I don't know  It's bad  In my mind, it's bad  And I've still got my stupid mask plates on  So it's just like  Oh, brother, here it is  Hey, I'm a monster  Hi  Hi, brother  Yeah, no, I'm just down from Worcester, Massachusetts  I need directions to the  What's that?  Is that a fire on you?  Listen, we're so uncivilized  Hey, look, I'm raising the room  I'm like you, homie  Can't we all just get a 
[01:26:30]  Put the knife away?  Could you put  Please  Oh, man  All right  Oh, stop  It's all stereotype  We're just having fun, Angie  I know, like yesterday  With the Polish people today  It's such equal opportunity  No, well  Hey, well, no, let's look  We did rag the Mexicans  Oh, that's right  With the peppers and the men  And the Hasidic Jews  There were a couple jokes  That came in for those folks  Oh, okay  So  Okay, because I was wondering  When we were going to get our tech  Take us up to Harlem one day 
[01:27:00]  And give us the tour  I want to see the Apollo Theater  I want to see  Did I say the Apollo Theater?  Yeah  What else is up there?  If you're going to take us for  Like a drive  In your neighborhood  Would you mind if we did it  In an armored tank?  Oh, ladies and gentlemen  We're now on Malcolm X Boulevard  If you look to the right  You'll see  Oh, look at that  Ladies and gentlemen  If you reach out of your seat  Come find your keb lot  Put on your vest and your helmet  This is your safety 
[01:27:30]  As we drive down Malcolm X Boulevard  You may hear a woozing  Next to your ears  Which you might think  Is a mosquito or a fly  These are actually  Small arms fire  That are going right past your head  Do the tour buses  Really go up there?  No, yes  They really do  Every day  Okay  And of course  We'll be just embarking  From the bus  To go on the  Attraction ride here  At the roller coaster  We call Crack Hall Mountain  Ladies and gentlemen 
[01:28:00]  If you look to your right  There's Huggie Bears Wild Ride  We will be leaving the bus  And going into an authentic  Seventies  Style  Pimpobile  In Cadillac  You'll all get a complimentary hat  With a big booster feather on it  Thank you for taking  Huzzled tour lines  Where our motto is  It's night  You know what I'm saying?  Mike, what's going on?  How you doing?  Alright  I just wanted to tell you guys  I'm a cop  And I go home at midnight 
[01:28:30]  And I'm scared  I got a gun on me  I blow the lights too  He has a gun  And he blows the red lights  You blow all the lights?  Yeah  Yeah  Cops got to be pretty cool with that  Like if you see some guy  Blowing lights in a bad neighborhood  And you pull him over or something  It's got to be like  Hey, you know  Officer  Come on  Look around  Yeah  Help me out  That's a guy  That's a guy  A little flock  You know where he's coming from  Come on  Alright, Mike  Thank you  Well, you know  It is a small percentage of people  But I think the image that some of these towns have 
[01:29:00]  A little scary  Let's hear from Starks  Starks  Yo, what's up?  You're from Harlem?  No doubt  Yeah  Listen  Y'all killing me over here, man  I understand  I'm out of stock  We're just being honest, though  We get a little nervous when we drive through Harlem  What do you want from us?

There's one up there  In some way  Yeah, there is  Yeah  Well, what  High five in Kentucky  What do you want?  Well, Starks, what could you tell Whitey about Harlem?  That we don't know  That we don't know  Listen, y'all got more respect than a regular brother up there  Yeah  Trust me, they ain't trying to make the neighborhood  Got to get a badge rap, you know?

Yeah, come to Starbucks  Starbucks  You guys will walk by laughing at us  Look at the white boys in Starbucks  Yeah, right?  White boys as well  I don't know why they put a Starbucks in Harlem  We have to be educated  You know, we're ignorant  We are ignorant  We got to get up there and then take a look around  Because I'm just going off of what I heard  And what I see when I'm driving through very late at night 
[01:31:00]  And it's very scary  Right  Yeah, what's the deal with that cop?  Somebody's scared  He is  Get the hell out of Harlem then  He says he's scared  When he drives home, he has a gun  He goes for the red lights too  Yeah, he's full of s***  Starks, you got some chops to you, man  We want to hang with you  You call back any time  All right, no problem, Luke  You're funny though, man  Yeah  And you guys suck  All right  Thanks, Starks  All right  Bye  Starks trying to give us the other side of it 
[01:31:30]  We obviously don't know anything about Harlem  We don't spend time up there  How can we make any kind of a s***?  That's what we're pretty much proving here  Rosa, very pissed off at us  Rosa  Yo  Hey, what's up?  Well, I mean, I'm black  I'm from Harlem  What's the deal?  And you're listening to our show?  Yeah  Man, I think that's awesome  Somebody's got to listen to it  So help us out  We don't understand Harlem  Is what we're pretty much saying here today 
[01:32:00]  Yeah  Why is it that you don't understand Harlem?  The people up there are just a skid as dark  We're naive white boys  We don't know about up there  What is it that you don't know?  What do you want to know?  I don't know  We get the image like a lot of people have  That it's very scary  And if you go up there  Something bad will happen to you  Well, I was born and raised up there  And there's nothing going on up there  People trying to survive  What do you think?  But you're black  So?  And you're white  And you're a point  So if we go up there  It's like  Are we going to be looked at as victims? 
[01:32:30]  Oh, please  How about you going to look at you like a victim?  What?  Are you walking up there with guns and stuff?  No  You know  I don't know  If I'm walking around  And  We just want to find the FDR  That's all  You don't know what the FDR is?

[01:33:30]  You can walk the streets, bro  Yeah  In and out of the buildings  They don't do a thing to you  You don't know  And stocks, man  Stocks, you're cool  Bro, but you're lying  Ain't nobody working on the projects  All right  They use the same garbage  On the back of the truck  And ride around and around and around  Right  Oh, man  See, this is the kind of stuff we hear  So we don't know what the real deal is  It's all right, though  I have no problem going up there  I'll go up there  We'll work something out 
[01:34:00]  Ain't nobody going to bother you up there  We're going to bring, like, a DAT recorder  And we're going to record our day in Harlem  That's it, man  It'll be like the Blair Witch Project  I'll find the tape years later  All right, man.  Josh!  Josh!  Wow, that's funny, man. 
[01:34:30]  It's a pile of crack pipes outside our tent.  What does it mean?  I'm sorry I came up here.  I'm sorry.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  What's that sound?  Oh, my God. 
[01:35:00]  Josh!  Oh, man.  I can't breathe.  What a mess.  The Alty and Anthony Show.  It's going today. 
[01:35:30]  We just got to bring it up in there.  We started the show with it.  Got a little out there.  There's a huge new development.  There is a huge new development.  The man who died in the whale tank at SeaWorld down there in Orlando.  The story goes, the guy was hiding.  He waited for the park to close.  Jumps in the tank with a killer whale, et cetera.  Jumps in there, completely naked.  They find him, I believe, this morning or yesterday, dead, still attached to the top of the whale. 
[01:36:00]  The killer whale.  Look how you're making it sound.  Still attached.  Still attached.  Well, he was found, the story, laying on top of the whale.  Laying on top of the whale, dead as a doorknob, not floating on the top of the pool, still attached to the killer whale.  We were just trying to figure out how.  Naked, Anthony, naked.  No clothes, nothing.  What is stuck?  How he stayed on the whale.  What is stuck to the whale?  Hello?  I don't know how he was staying on the whale.  Hello, Mueller. 
[01:36:30]  Hello?  Are you saying that perhaps he was trying to pleasure himself at the whale's blowhole's expense?  Well, Ed, you come up with something better.  I can't figure out any other way he would have still been there by morning.  If he stayed there, the park closed, now everyone leaves the park, he figures, now's my chance.  Dives in the killer whale tank, takes his clothes off.  In the morning, seven in the morning, whenever they show up and see him, he's on top of the whale. 
[01:37:00]  Now, that is a long time to be up there.  So maybe something had to be fastening him to the whale.  Why isn't anyone else bringing this up in the media?  He was doing the blowhole.  It's obvious.  Well, I think so.  I think you're right.  I think you're right.  That's a sick F.  That's the deal.  And then we figured, earlier we were saying, the blowhole closes up when the whale dives.  So perhaps, as he was having a little fun, the whale decides to descend, closes the blowhole. 
[01:37:30]  Oh!  All right.  Well, there's an incredible development in this story.  Yeah.  The name of the whale.  Yeah, this is very interesting.  I'm not making this up.  The name of the whale that the guy was attached to.  Well, let me spell it out.  Because I don't even know if we can say this on the air.  You can say the whale's name. 
[01:38:00]  Till I Come.  Or Till It Come.  How's it spelled?  Thank you, Anthony.  It's spelled T-I-L-L.  That's Till.  Right.  I.  I.  That's I.  Okay.  K-U-M.  That's the name.  That's the whale's name.  That's the name of the whale.  Till I Come.  Till I Come.  It's Till I Come.  Till I Come.  Who's laughing out there?  I hear someone laughing outside.  Who's laughing?  Who was that? 
[01:38:30]  Who the hell was that?  Who's laughing out there?  That was the whale's name.  It is the whale's name.  It's the whale's name.  The whale's still alive.  Yeah.  Gurgling a little bit.  Do you think it was a sperm whale?  Oh, ho, went from a killer whale to a humpback.  Oh, ho, ho, K-Rock.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But that is a very interesting development there.  Read it for yourself in the paper. 
[01:39:00]  Till I Come.  Or Till I Come.  You've got to say it real fast, I guess.  Till I Come.  Telecom was the name of the whale that the guy was stuck to.  Yeah.  You can't write stuff better than this, man.  Yeah.  You can try for hours.  Well, the other whale, Touch-A-Snatch, in the next pen, was uninjured.  I just want to make sure everyone knows that Touch-A-Snatch was fine.  Can we bring Popeye in? 
[01:39:30]  Because Popeye has some experience with...  With a killer whale.  Hey, Popeye.  Yes?  Thanks for coming back on the show.  Well, blow me down.  Give me member.  Now, could you explain this story?  Why a guy would be naked on the back of a killer whale?  Obviously, he was a nautical man.  Yeah.  A man of the sea.  Yeah.  Because we used to do that. 
[01:40:00]  We'd be out at sea for a long time.  Without any signs, Kapuski.  Ah-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.  Ah-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka 
[01:40:30]  It's kind of hard for Popsky, though.  Why?  Well, I'm used to Olivesk.  Yeah?  She's like a little, uh, a little Gupski.  Little skinny Olivesk.  Oh, gotta get what you can out there at sea.  You figure that out, okay. 
[01:41:00]  So you get so desperate, you jump on, uh, whales back?  Well, you start with other sea livesk.  Yeah?  Yeah, like a sea hankin.  Ooh, you ever touch one of those and they all fold up?  Ooh.  Ooh, better than Olivesk.  Then you go for the bearded clamsk.  Ooh, it takes the clamsk, it takes your knife, and you start shuckin'.  Ooh, I shucked it, and shucked it, and shucked it. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, I'm quite the mother shucker.  You just keep shuckin', so you've got a juicy, clammy mask in your hands.  Then you use that!  I was shuckin' everything that moved through.  You're scuffed off the teeth of you. 
[01:42:00]  When that didn't work, it clamped shut on Popskye's member.  Yeah.  My mighty member!  So, Popeye, have you, um...  I've done a whale!  You've done a whale, huh?  I was out to seize.  Yep.  Monsk has gone by.  Okay.  I didn't have Pusskye in Monsk.  I didn't want to do the whales.  Oh.  You've got to grab a cute one, though.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than doing an ugly whale. 
[01:42:30]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  But nothing's better than a huge, livegin', breathegin' Monskow!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Oh.  Once you go whalesk, you never go back.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  A lot different than olivesk!  Olivesk is a skinskie bitch!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  With the no指, skis! 
[01:43:00]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  No.  Now, why wouldn't you do, like, the sea hag before the whale?  Well, not the sea hag.  Oh, that old cave.  I'd rather have blowhole than a sea hag.  You ever see the haggy?  Smells like chum.  You know when you throw chums off the sides of a boat? 
[01:43:30]  That's the sea hag.  Hey, uh, Popeye, would you...  Wimsky wouldn't do her for free burgers.  Wimsky could fit into a shrimpsk!  You've never done sea livesk?  No, I can't say I have.  There we were.  Tentacles to testicles. 
[01:44:00]  Me and the octopus-ky!  Do you get crabs from, uh, from the sea life?  I got a crab oncek!  Yeah?  A little tight.  Gotta watch the clock on your testicles.  I'm Popeye the Sailor Man 
[01:44:30]  When there's nothing to nail you should grab you a whale  Says Popeye the Sailor  Ha ha ha ha ha ha </pre>
