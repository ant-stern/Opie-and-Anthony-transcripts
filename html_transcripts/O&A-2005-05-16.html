<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between segments.  The show began with discussions about the upcoming *Revenge of the Sith* movie, criticizing the previous Star Wars installments, particularly Episodes I and II and Jar Jar Binks.  Listener anecdotes recounted the frenzy surrounding Star Wars premieres, including elaborate costumes and a past stunt by the show's crew spoiling the plot for waiting fans.  This segued into a discussion about negative experiences at movie theaters, specifically the Comac theater on Long Island, with numerous callers ("Steve on Long Island," "James in Comac," "Donnie on Long Island," and others) detailing instances of violence and disruptive behavior from various moviegoers, focusing on issues with noise levels, popcorn eating, and cell phone use.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, also shared their own frustrations with moviegoing etiquette.

The show then shifted to a segment detailing a woman's false report of her own abduction, focusing on graphic details from the police report and the hosts' vulgar speculation about her motivations.  This transitioned into a series of increasingly erratic voicemails from a woman named Sage to her ex-boyfriend, Mark, documenting the breakdown of their relationship. Callers Matt and Deidre shared similar experiences with their exes.  The hosts interjected with crude humor and negative comments about Sue Johanson's sex advice.  A listener recounted being drugged and taken to a strip club with Russian dancers, prompting offensive stereotypes about Russian women from the hosts.  A phone call with Elo, a SiriusXM executive, discussed a Rolling Stone article about the show.  The segment concluded with discussion of upcoming show segments, including a recording of a father yelling at his son.

A substantial portion of the broadcast centered on XM Satellite Radio's success, exceeding 4 million subscribers.  An XM representative highlighted the company's growth and partnerships with Hyundai and Toyota, while jokingly criticizing a poorly-received portable XM unit. The conversation touched upon XM's diverse programming, comparing the dedicated listenership of NPR's Bob Edwards to the broader appeal of Opie & Anthony.  A humorous anecdote involved XM executive Lee Abrams' plane tail number.  The "Me 103" contest was announced.  The hosts then criticized recent episodes of *Family Guy*, comparing them unfavorably to *American Dad*, and a caller attributed this to FCC regulations.  A phone interview with Pepper Keenan of Corrosion of Conformity followed, discussing Keenan's near-miss with Metallica, his friendship with Dimebag Darrell, and his views on the music industry.  The interview included a humorous story about hotel security mistaking Keenan for a woman.  The segment concluded with clips of Sue Johanson's sex advice show, prompting laughter and commentary from the hosts.

The show included a segment beginning with a vulgar description of human conception, followed by listener calls with crude jokes.  A caller expressed dislike for Tommy Lee.  A discussion about a library patron requesting books with suggestive titles led to unrelated music and a Gamefly.com commercial.  The hosts then discussed Billy Crystal's frustration with cell phone use and offered a sarcastic review of *Monster-in-Law*.  A lengthy segment played snippets of Paul Anka's music, interspersed with commentary and a recording of Anka berating his band members.

Finally, the hosts, and possibly a guest, ranked their top war films, including *The Great Escape*, *Apocalypse Now* (their top pick), and expressing surprise at its high ranking.  A humorous, dismissive comment was made about Charlie Sheen's narration in an unspecified film. The show ended abruptly during a discussion of Channel 4's list of the 100 greatest war films.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts frequently used highly offensive and racially charged language.

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you for listening. 
[00:03:30]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[00:04:00]  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  It's terrible.  We will be in the end of the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Asshole.  Asshole.  Asshole.  Asshole. 
[00:04:30]  Asshole.  Asshole.  Asshole.  You just mind your peas and juice, buster, and remember who you're dealing with.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Hello, exactly.  Hey, stinks, and I don't like it.  Call me sir, goddammit. 
[00:05:00]  Okay, terrific.  A family member dies, then you insult me.  What the hell is the matter with you anyway?  Okay, terrific.  Yes, sir.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism.  Happens every time one of those dancers start boom-tangin' around with those show folk facts. 
[00:05:30]  Nottice bouncing all over the joint.  Boy, ass was wiggling, too.  God, did they butcher that last night?  What?  That was on TV?  Yeah, I was going to sleep.  It's always a treat to try to get to sleep on Sunday night after I can sleep in on Sunday morning until like 11.  So you try to go to sleep Sunday night to get up for our schedule.  And it's just a chore. 
[00:06:00]  So Smokey and the Bandit was on.  And I think it was on American Movie Classics, AMC, which I can never figure out if it's a movie channel or not.  You know, sometimes it seems to be, sometimes not.  I put it on and just butchered.  They cut out every single little reference to anything.  I mean, you know, when Sally Field is in the car, of course Smokey and the Bandit, with Burt Reynolds,  and they jump the bridge and she goes, I want to jump something else. 
[00:06:30]  I want to jump a house.  I want to jump up.  And Burt Reynolds goes, why don't you jump me?  They cut that out.  It was, I mean, how bad is it when you cut that reference out?  And every line, pretty much every single line Gleason spoke was dubbed in somebody else doing it.  TV is just a waste of time at this point.  I'm surprised you would even watch a movie on regular TV.  I was trying to go to sleep. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, that's the only reason?  Pop that on just to get an occasional, you know, a little laugh.  I'll go to HBO and all the movie channels, but, you know, to watch a movie on regular TV at this point, why bother?  They butcher all of them to the point, it just gets you mad.  I love what Fox is doing.  I guess after the premiere of the latest Star Wars movie, they're running Attack of the Clones on Fox.  They make it sound like no one's ever seen this thing, and the best place to watch it is going to be commercial television. 
[00:07:30]  No.  You buy these things now for nothing.  You just have them.  You keep them in a library.  I picked up the Star Wars, the first one and the second one.  Sat through them over the weekend.  Really had nothing much to do.  He's got to remake those films now.  No, I'm talking the episode one and episode two.  That's what I mean.  Not episode four.  Oh, okay. 
[00:08:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  In five and six.  I forgot.  His math is all over the place.  Right, right.  I lost the one with Jar Jar Binks.  I'm sorry.  I'm thinking about the first Star Wars movie, which is the fourth one, right?  Which is the fourth one.  Right, okay.  A new hope, Opie.  A new hope.  Goddamn.  You'd think the future would have much better graphics.  Yeah, I know.  Well, from what I hear, that's what they're going to try to do with Sith, the latest one.  You know, there are people...  They kind of transform into that whole 70s-looking technology.  I was going to say, though, you know there are people out there that have never seen the 
[00:08:30]  original couple of Star Wars movies, and now after they see the new one, they're going  to go, whoa, wait, the story continues?  The saga continues, and all I have to do is go to Blockbuster or Tower Records and get  the films?  Why does this look like shit?  Right.  Who's this guy?  Wow, George Lucas really called it in for the fourth and fifth film there.  He must have got senile or something.  Aren't very special.  Yeah.  They've just got to remake those now.  It's obvious.  Oh, man.  If that's his latest project, although that would kind of be cool, but you'd get the purists 
[00:09:00]  that don't want anything done with the original, but that kind of would be a cool idea.  And I think it would work.  They would cast and remake the first three with all the special effects that they could  do now, but the purists would just shit in their pants.  Reviews coming in, amazing, though.  Right on it.  Every review that's coming in for Sith is saying this is a great movie.  Amazing.  Right on the front page of the New York Post Star Wars review, the dots have finally been  connected.  The Force is with Lucas this time. 
[00:09:30]  People are leaving the theater weeping, Opie.  Weeping?  Weeping.  Is it a chick flick?  Is that what we're dealing with?  A chick flick here?  There's a love story.  Great special effects.  I can't wait.  I want to see it.  Is it actually in theaters yet?  No, Friday.  But people have been waiting online for days and days and days.  Yeah, the premiere at Cannes, and the reviews are in for that. 
[00:10:00]  Everyone, even the New York Times guy, loved it.  Yeah, so it's looking like it's going to be the biggie.  The big, good one.  Of the first two, the Jar Jar Binks one sucked.  I just watched them over the weekend.  The Jar Jar Binks is like, the first one, Phantom Menace, is not even useful in the whole thing.  It really doesn't do much.  It kind of, in a confusing way, establishes how the Empire first starts, you know, with some kind of problem with the government that they have in place at the time. 
[00:10:30]  So it's kind of like, who cares?  There's, you know, and you've got the, it's like a kid movie, because you've got that little kid Anakin in there.  The speeder, or the pod race is pretty much the coolest part.  That's kind of fun to watch.  And then, Attack of the Clones, hoo-hoo.  That's pretty cool. 
[00:11:00]  I couldn't, I watched it, I popped it in and had to, out loud, go, hoo-hoo, a pack of the clones.  I'm at home doing impressions.  A pack of the clones, pop it in.  Here's the part where they rip me off.  And, yeah, that one's pretty good.  They got some, you know, good little storyline there and stuff.  The whining from, what's his name, the guy that plays Anakin.  I don't even know their goddamn name.  Hayden Christensen, what? 
[00:11:30]  Hayden Christensen.  He is the worst.  Lucas is known for not casting, you know, the best actors in his movies, that's for sure.  Very wooden, just kind of there.  You know, they're not good actors, but you don't really need them for this kind of story.  Yeah.  But he is just, you know, that second movie, man, he's just whining through the whole thing.  Just a whiny crybaby.  And then the last one, the one that's Sith, is, you know, he actually pulls off being the beginnings of the Dark Lord, Darth Vader. 
[00:12:00]  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Do you know that old bit where Rick and Staz were giving out free CDs on the line of the first Star Wars,  and then they started yelling out some of the key points to the movie?  I think it was actually, Ben was part of that bit as well, right?  And Earl.  And Earl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you hear Rick start yelling because they're throwing the CDs and all the giveaways back at the van.  And Earl had double parked or something.  No, no, he got in between cars.  He actually got boxed in, if you remember correctly. 
[00:12:30]  Is Ben around?  Because Ben was part of that whole thing.  They were trying to escape.  This was, we were thinking of doing this again, but we just couldn't pull it off.  But basically, yeah, here in New York we had fans, like the Uber fans, all dressed up as all the characters and stuff,  and waiting on line for days on end.  And, you know, the Internet, gotta love the Internet, had all the plot spoilers.  So we went down there with a bullhorn, and we made believe that we were a radio station giving away some great stuff to everybody online. 
[00:13:00]  Right, Ben?  Yeah, dumbest move ever letting Earl drive, though, because that's how we almost got killed, because Earl got us boxed in.  What a getaway driver.  Yeah, so we hooked them all in by saying, hey, we're here from WNEW, want to thank you guys for waiting on line for the new Star Wars movie.  Everyone's cheering and stuff, and we got stuff for everybody, and they're throwing out, like, WNEW stupid stuff, like pens and stuff, right?  Tons of stuff, and then Rick started giving out the lines, and then the stuff just came flying at the van.  Well, then all of a sudden, you know, and Rick, well, Rick was making the announcement, like, we got all this stuff for you guys, thanks, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:13:30]  And then he goes, oh, what other thing?  And he had a bullhorn, and he starts to, you know, tell them the end of the movie, and who's going to die, and this and that.  And all of a sudden, you hear the whole crowd change.  I wasn't there, but on the radio, it was unbelievable.  And people just started getting really pissed and started throwing everything they could find at the van.  Yeah, you just heard the van getting pelted.  Nothing like some 30-year-old loser dressed up as Darth Vader shaking the van, and Earl, oh, my God, we're boxed in. 
[00:14:00]  Isn't it true that Earl later on fell asleep at his chick's house, and the cops wound up getting the van, finding fingerprints on the steering wheel?  Guys.  Yeah, Steve.  Yeah, also, I want to let you know this morning, Stern was saying that on Survivor, Jeff Pope said something about the last immunity challenge.  They asked the buoy or bob, and now he's getting ripped off the bye-bye buoy.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  I'm telling you the truth.  I'll go with you later.  All right.  Punch it out. 
[00:14:30]  Bye.  Yeah, and then they were trying to get out of there, and they couldn't because stupid Earl, yeah, boxed the van in.  So then all of a sudden, they're inside, and you hear, like, you know, objects just hitting the side of the van.  Oh, hitting the side of the van.  Live on the show.  It was really, really funny.  Really funny.  Yeah.  Those dorks are waiting on line again, right?  Oh, yeah.  The best part about that, by the time they get to see the movie, they're going to fall asleep in the theater.  They'll be exhausted.  It's kind of like when you were in college, and you did the all-nighters for tests and stuff.  By the time you actually got to the test, you were too tired to care and just wanted to get out of there so you could go to bed. 
[00:15:00]  Now they're standing on line, and if you're lucky and you passed by there, I guess they're at the Ziegfeld Theater.  Right over here.  Yeah.  A couple blocks away.  If you're lucky, what I hear is you could catch a couple of them having a lightsaber fight, which has to just be exciting.  They pull out these toy lightsabers and go at each other and kill yourself.  It's actually more masculine if you bang cockheads.  Yeah, exactly.  Into each other's tongues. 
[00:15:30]  We got some clips of these Zeros waiting on line.  Can you play them today, Derek, or do I have to wait for Eric to come back in the studio here?  He's on it.  You are on it?  Of course he is.  Cut three.  We got some audio of the fans waiting in line.  Let's listen to this one if we have it ready.  Go ahead, Derek.  Oh, this is a deeply damaged guy, but he's fantastic.  He wants to be in line, but more importantly, he's meeting people every day. 
[00:16:00]  That's just part of the process of being a hardcore fan.  All right.  I have no idea what that clip was about.  What is that?  It was this guy, Rick McCallum, was asked what he thinks of the fan who's been waiting outside a theater in Seattle since the beginning of January.  Are you kidding?  Since January?  Since January, there's one dork out there just trying to get his name in the paper.  Attention, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's telling everyone, I've been here since January.  They're going, really? 
[00:16:30]  Wow, you're like the biggest fan ever.  That's right.  Can we talk to you for a few minutes for our little paper in Portland, Oregon?  Sure.  Sure.  I'm not going anywhere.  What do these guys do to take dumps?  I don't know.  Let's try another one.  Let's take a dump.  You just take a spot.  I love that.  When he comes back, just go, no.  Yep.  I'm not leaving.  I didn't see you here.  I didn't see you here.  Why?  Who are you?  Challenging him to a lightsaber fight. 
[00:17:00]  Just cut him in line, and now he's second and no one cares.  Let's go to track four.  Chris Placen, Star Wars fan in line to see Movie Marathon.  Placen says it's worth it to get up early and stand in line for the Movie Marathon.  All right.  Worth it.  Let's go to track four there.  I'm looking forward to it, obviously, but I also wanted to see the three originals again  on their big screen.  I mean, I've seen them on DVD loads of times, but it's good to see them back on the big screen  again.  Is it? 
[00:17:30]  That's right.  Cock it.  Oh, my God.  Now we got a track of this fan dressed as a Jedi Knight.  Oh.  Go to...  Don't mess with him.  Go to cut sex there, Derek.  Nerds.  I just want to be there, you know.  I just can't wait.  The music's going to be around.  I think this is huge.  I've never seen so many stormtroopers before.  I could take them all.  Whoa.  All right.  Well, these geeks are all over the world doing this.  So, whatever. 
[00:18:00]  I just can't wait to see the movie.  A couple weeks down the road, the theater will be a little less crowded.  I'll go on a Tuesday around noon.  I'll be very happy.  I'm going to go opening night.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  Are you really?  I'm going to sit in that theater and enjoy being with people.  You're going to get tickets for the 1 a.m. showing?  That's it.  Right when it's released, I am going to see it in a theater full of people.  Because I love going to the movies when it's packed.  Lots of people around me to really add to the movie-going experience. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, God.  Dude, I'm telling you, man.  I might have been kidding.  You better get there at least two hours early.  This is going to be a lot.  At least.  This is going to be one of these dumb movies.  They're going to be running it around the clock.  Yeah, multiple theaters.  It'll be like a 3 a.m. showing.  Who goes to the movies at 3 in the morning?  There will be people there.  Oh, it'll be packed.  Especially opening weekend.  I don't understand why people go to the movies and just yap through the movie.  Or do anything. 
[00:19:00]  I always say stuff like, oh, I wish everyone drove like me.  Because then everyone would get somewhere faster.  But I've got to be realistic.  Highways would be full of just blood and brain matter and stuff.  But the movie-going experience, I wish everybody handled the movies like me.  I go in with the only reason I have to go to the movies is to see the goddamn movie.  I don't talk.  I sit there.  I watch the movie.  I don't answer cell phones.  I don't do anything. 
[00:19:30]  What is the problem with people that they have to be doing other things and ruining the movie-going experience?  Because there's so many people out there that they go with someone else to the movie  that they feel like they have to acknowledge their presence in the theater.  I don't go alone.  I don't go alone.  I know, but you're like a normal person.  But there's a lot of people out there, just because they are going to the movie with their friend  or boyfriend, girlfriend, what have you, they have to acknowledge them throughout the whole movie.  Like, oh, my God.  Oh, wow. 
[00:20:00]  You see that?  So I was saying, well, at the office the other day.  Right, right, right.  What?  You're at the movie.  Shut up.  Shut up now.  They've got to yap.  Go talk about the movie at Starbucks after the film's over.  There you go.  The answer to your question, why do people yap at the movies?  They actually did do a study.  The answer, melanin.  There certainly is a disproportionate number of black people that like to talk at the movie,  as opposed to white people.  I wouldn't know, because I go to the white movie theater. 
[00:20:30]  Well, I do now, too, Opie.  But as you know, I used to live in Brooklyn.  You search out the white movie theaters.  I had to go to the black movies.  And it is a little frightening.  And unfortunately, it's not like you can turn around and say, hey, shh, please, I'm trying to watch the movie.  Because you'll probably get shanked in the throat.  Or punched and then wake up in a hospital with Christmas music playing.  The latest Christmas movies will be out.  Right.  You can catch. 
[00:21:00]  Excuse me, sir.  I'm trying to watch the movie.  Bam!  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  What happened?  I was...  Okay, I remember.  I was watching Star Wars.  I heard a cell phone go off.  It was late May.  It was like, yeah, late May.  Why is there a Christmas tree in my room?  And now...  And this isn't my room.  It's 4.30 in the afternoon.  It's dark out.  I see Christmas lights.  And there's presents around me. 
[00:21:30]  Excuse me, sir.  We're trying to...  Bam!  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.  Jingle...  What happened?  You used to go to the Comac movie theater, right?  Yep.  Until there were so many shootings that we got the hint.  And Whitey realized, okay, this movie theater isn't for us.  More action in the lobby than on the screen.  They had so many people shooting at the screen, shooting each other online. 
[00:22:00]  Stabbings, too.  Stabbings.  It was a place where the gangs would just hang out as you, as a law-abiding citizen,  wanted to see a lousy movie.  Latin Kings from Brentwood would come in.  Very scary.  To get you through the weekend.  All you want to do is watch a dumb movie.  And you couldn't even enjoy that because you were worried that you were going to get shot or something.  That's all.  Just trying to see a movie.  And you've got to worry about getting in a fight.  And it doesn't matter.  I have the worst goddamn luck in movie theaters.  I will get there a little early. 
[00:22:30]  I'll search out a good spot.  Okay?  Because I don't want to have to deal with climbing over people.  I don't want to sit in a seat that's too far away or too close.  Because then it's always on my mind.  I'm like, goddammit, I'm too far.  Or I'm too close.  So I get there a little early.  I pick out a good seat.  Mm-hmm.  And it never fails that right before the movie starts, a gaggle of criminals comes in and sits right around me.  Right around me.  And then I'm tense the whole movie going, oh, I'm going to be killed because they're not going to shut up. 
[00:23:00]  And I'm going to get pissed.  And I'm going to throw something.  And there's going to be a fight.  It never fails.  I'll sit there and go, I think we made it.  I think we made it.  The movie's starting.  The lights are dimming.  And there's no one around us that could possibly, yeah, I think this seat here good.  It's a lot.  Oh, no.  It's always the last minute traffic.  It is.  Because I'm the same way.  Ah, no one in front of me.  This is awesome.  The previews are just about over.  And here comes the movie.  And all of a sudden, last second, they always sit right in front of you. 
[00:23:30]  Here they come, right in front.  And they're punching each other and laughing and trying to smoke and drink or do something in there.  Answer their cell phones.  Yeah, all their cell phones are going off like crazy.  You know how you do that thing, a kid running by screaming?  Yeah.  You ever been to a movie theater where, like, they decide that the movie is good enough for a babysitter, I guess?  Yeah.  They bring their kids to the movie theater and their kids will run up and down the aisle.  Yeah.  Have you been in one of these?  Ah! 
[00:24:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Up and down the aisle.  And you're looking.  Why aren't they containing this animal?  Why?  Because it is.  It's a babysitter now.  They're on the cell phone in the corner somewhere conducting business that they can't conduct when their kid is around the house yelling.  And their kid now can just run around in the movie theater.  Yeah.  Because who cares?  It's their babysitter.  It just cost them a couple of bucks to get in there. 
[00:24:30]  And I'm just trying to watch the goddamn movie.  Let's go to John and Comac.  John, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Comac.  Home of the Comac Motor Inn and the Comac Movie Theater.  Yeah, good times back in high school, man.  Good times.  Good times.  Yeah.  My first date ever.  I took these couple of girls, me and my buddy, took these girls to the movie theater, and we had a gun pulled on us.  Oh.  Why would you have a gun pulled on you? 
[00:25:00]  Were you being robbed?  Did you speak up?  What happened?  No, we were a bunch of Comac kids.  You know, we were wearing little pieces of gold, walking in there like we owned the place, and a couple of kids of Brentwood do it otherwise.  Brentwood.  That is a dangerous area these days.  Yeah, good thing my friend's mommy was outside, so we pulled ass to her car.  My friend's mommy.  The station wagon pulled up and let you kids off?  Yeah.  And you guys think you're badasses?  Yeah.  All badasses from Comac.  With your...  With your fine gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. 
[00:25:30]  With your very thin bling on, thinking you're all that.  And then the Brentwood Hispanics come in, and it's over, Johnny.  My friend with his bar mitzvah gold on, thinking he's a shit.  His bar mitzvah gold.  All the people are wearing license plates.  I went one time to, I think a movie was my buddies from work, they were all these hardcore black guys,  we worked in a warehouse together, and I didn't realize that there was a one-seat rule  when you sit next to another guy, and it was an empty theater.  So we all walk in and sit down, and I sit right next to my friend Malcolm, 
[00:26:00]  and he goes, what the fuck are you doing, man?  We're not dating.  Move over.  I'm sorry.  Leave an empty seat for a man.  Suburban idiot.  Sit next to another man.  No surprise here.  Let's go to James in Comac.  James.  What's up, boys?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Two quick stories for you.  First one was, I never go to the Comac movie theater anymore because it is just run by criminals.  But I ran into a pimp walking out one time.  Not a guy who looked like a pimp, or, you know, the full getup.  The loud green suit, purple hat with an orange feather, and a gold cane. 
[00:26:30]  Huggy bear.  Yeah.  And had the whores from Brentwood nearby.  Second story was, and I told him.  Wait, and he was trying to get the girls some dates as people were leaving the movie theater?  There you go.  That's a little business.  Oh, yeah.  What you guys got to understand now, you know, there are towns that just have these theaters,  like these black, whatever you want to call them, these gang theaters or what have you.  Gang theaters.  That's good.  But this Comac multiplex is in a relatively nice area. 
[00:27:00]  Nice area, but it's bordered with crap.  Yeah.  And people come from all over because it was the first real multiplex in our area on Long Island.  And this is the stuff you just didn't expect at first.  No.  Going there.  But slowly but surely, all this has moved in.  The pimps, the drug dealer, and the gangsters.  You know, when you look in the parking lot and just see, like, a ton of old Toyotas with spoilers on them,  that you're in trouble.  And gold-painted hubcaps.  You know there's trouble.  Second story for the guys. 
[00:27:30]  I told this a couple years ago on N.E.W.  Was gone in 60 seconds.  A Latin family comes in right as the movie's starting.  We're there with my friends.  And they're stealing the cars and whatnot.  And the Latin boyfriend, baby daddy, whatever you want to call him, is going,  Yo, man, I haven't tried that.  I got to fucking try that one.  He's picking up pointers.  Yeah, meanwhile, the grandmother, who looks like she's 25, has the three-year-old kid  rocking back and forth, hitting it to my legs as I'm trying to watch the movie. 
[00:28:00]  And baby daddy's telling me about his methods of stealing cars.  It's a very safe movie theater.  That's classic.  All right, thanks, James.  That one time I was at the movie theater in Brooklyn, and I had a Hispanic family in front of me,  and they just went on and on and wouldn't shut up.  And it was an entire row in front of us that was just full of Hispanics.  And I'm sitting there going, Oh, they're not going to shut up. 
[00:28:30]  They're not going to shut up.  And my girlfriend at one point just yells out, Would you shut the fuck up?  Oh, great.  And that's when the guy turned around and said of his chick that was up there,  said, Oh, she's in battle mode.  Now she's in battle mode.  I'm like, battle mode.  Oh, this is trouble.  This is trouble.  You bring up something that's great that maybe we can get into later.  You know, our chicks.  And I'm saying our chicks.  I'm talking about all guys out there. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  To get us in trouble.  Yeah.  You know, that's obviously something your chick should have said.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  But they're not turning around and going to confront the chick.  No.  They're going to confront you.  No, it's me.  Now you have to defend your honor, her honor.  Because then the woman turns around and goes, How about I smack your face?  I'm like, I just came to see Mission Impossible 2.  I'm trying to see Mission Impossible 2.  And now I'm in a fight for my life with some Hispanic family. 
[00:29:30]  Now it's just going to be a mission to get out of this.  Mission Impossible.  Get out alive.  Exactly.  She's throwing young Hispanic children at me.  It's just horrific.  Yeah.  Quick, go for the exit by the screen.  I think our car's parked outside.  Baby, you go for the door.  I'm going to head for the ventilation system.  I think I can get them on my trail and lose them.  Oh, she's in battle mode, is she? 
[00:30:00]  Unbelievable.  It was frightening.  Did you have to change seats?  What I did was probably one of the biggest whitey pussy moves ever.  I got up and left the theater.  Just left.  What was I going to do?  Dude, there were, it was a complete row, one Hispanic family.  Guys, those chicks that'll pull razor blades out and slit your throat, and screaming children.  It was a whole family that did not give a shit what was going on in this theater. 
[00:30:30]  It was their living room.  It was their roach infested living room at the time.  Anyone in there was an inconvenience to them.  So I went up, you know, I find the assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  Hey, Red, you're the assistant to the assistant manager.  And I was placed in another theater that was playing Mission Impossible 2. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, that's pretty cool.  That was just starting.  So I got to sit down with other frightened white people that had left that theater, I think.  Because it was just, there was only a few of us.  And we were all white, just sitting there, kind of, I'm a pussy, but at least I'm seeing the movie and I'm alive.  You know, this is not a movie that comes out that I want to see that badly that I'll go on weekends or when the movie theater's crowded.  Yeah.  All these movies, I wait to almost the day it's going to be out of theaters, and then I finally see the movie.  And then it's a lot less people and a lot less hassle. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Every once in a while I do get in a situation because maybe other people want to go or what have you, and I'm in a crowded movie theater.  I have the strangest pet peeve.  Maybe there's other people out there that feel the same way.  But when the previews are done and it gets really quiet for that minute or two as the movie's slowly but surely starting up,  I start hearing everyone eating their popcorn and opening up their candy and drinking their soda.  It goes right through me where I start, like, getting all, I get nuts. 
[00:32:00]  I get nuts.  It's kind of like the same thing that happens when, you know, I hear vacuum cleaners.  Yeah.  It goes right through me.  I don't know what it is.  I mean, when you're in a theater and there's a couple hundred people all eating popcorn at the same time, it sounds like locusts.  It is the most disturbing sound.  It is our locusts.  Next time, listen closely.  Animals.  As, you know, it gets dark and really quiet in the theater, and listen to what's going on around you.  It is amazing.  Everyone.  Yeah.  And the packaging for, you know, all this stuff is just the worst, because it's not a quick little rip and you're ready to eat. 
[00:32:30]  No, it takes forever.  It takes forever for these people to open up their shit.  They're all digging in their hands and making noise.  I don't even want to admit this on the air, but it just drives me.  It's gotten to the point where I'm with people and they have to tell me, just relax, relax.  It'll be over soon.  Yeah.  And there's been a few times where I want to just walk out.  I can't handle it.  And then I'm just waiting for everyone to finish up with their popcorn and stuff, and it usually takes a good 20 to 30 minutes. 
[00:33:00]  And then I can finally relax.  Do you eat anything?  If I do, I'm so considerate, because I know how bad it is.  You wait until the movie gets loud?  Or either, yeah, or I'll open up my stuff beforehand.  No joke.  Yeah.  I'm eating popcorn like...  Just letting it melt in your mouth?  Basically, yeah.  Soften it up.  Squeeze it between your tongue and palate.  It is one of my worst pet peeves.  Dude, it's like...  That's a little rough.  It's like if you were taking your nails and just right across a chalkboard, it's the same effect to me. 
[00:33:30]  Wow.  It just drives me nuts.  And people that go with me, they think I'm out of my mind.  I'm a Twizzlers guy.  See, that's nice and soft.  I don't think that makes much noise.  No.  Popcorn makes a lot of noise.  Oh, it's just like, like I said, I'll say it again, like locusts just going at it.  Donnie on Long Island.  What's up, Donnie?  A couple of things.  One is, here's worse than guys talking.  These guys are the gangsters talking around you.  And I'm there with my wife.  And my wife turns around and goes, you guys haven't shut up in the entire fucking movie. 
[00:34:00]  And so my wife opens the can of worms with them.  And now I'm the one holding the bag that I have to, like, defend her and everything.  And I look over and I go, why don't you just shut up?  Let them, you know, let them talk.  Let them do whatever they want.  Yeah, because she turns around and she starts it.  And then I got to get involved, you know?  What did they do besides apologize to her for being loud?  Yeah.  You little bitch.  And then the girl starts licking my wife in the head.  And then the other thing is, you ever just wish you were like Charles Bronson at that moment? 
[00:34:30]  And it's like, just deal with it that way, you know?  It's like, imagine Charles Bronson next to the theater.  Okay, you guys shut the fuck up now.  Pull out a magnum and blow their heads off.  Yeah, that would be nice.  That would be fun.  But then you would go to jail for a long time.  Yeah, you'd go to jail.  And the lawyer fees would be astronomical.  You're a man in jail, what can you say?  All right.  Thank you, Don.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Mark in Long Island.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I went about 10 years ago.  Me and my girlfriend at the time went to go see A Time to Kill. 
[00:35:00]  So we're trying to go.  She lived on the South Shore.  So we're trying to go to Rockville Center.  Sold out.  Trying to go to, you know, Westbury.  Anywhere we could go, it's all sold out.  The only place we can go to the movies is the Green Acres Mall at Valley Stream to see this movie.  Now, you guys know Valley Stream.  So you get in there, and it's just like a crime scene waiting to happen.  And it's all, you have to go through metal detectors to go through there.  Now, in the movie A Time to Kill, there's somebody that's, some white guys rape a little black girl and whatever. 
[00:35:30]  Everybody in the movie theater thought they were in the courthouse, and they were ready to lynch, like, all the white people.  And me and my girlfriend are sitting there just like, oh, my God, we are going to die.  It is rough to go to a movie that's racially charged and look around and see it's a very diverse audience.  People do tend to feel a little uncomfortable, don't they?  Oh, it is.  You sit there and, oh, this is uncomfortable.  I think it was a bad move.  So I went to see Malcolm X in the theater, and there's one scene where the cops are beating up a black guy before X and the rest of the Muslims go down to protest. 
[00:36:00]  And I actually went, good job, Officer Ho.  That could be some trouble for you there, Jimmy.  Let's go to Paul on Long Island.  Yeah, hi.  My wife and I just moved to Ronkonkoma, and we were looking to go see that movie Saw.  Yeah.  And we went to the Comac movie theater, which was a bad idea.  But all the gang kids, they just keep using their bleep, bleep Nextel cell phones the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  Talking to you.  Beep, bleep, bleep. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, all the time.  Beep, bleep, bleep.  And they're laughing.  That's why they've got to bring the drinking age back down to 18, I'm telling you right now,  because these kids have nothing to do but hang out in movie theaters.  Go to the movies?  Yeah.  I mean, the parents are on to the keg parties at their houses when they're away on those little weekend jaunts.  Yeah.  So what happens, it was happening in Huntington.  You know, every Friday and Saturday night, the theaters, it didn't matter what movie,  were just packed with teenagers because that's where they socialize and hang out  and maybe cop a feel during the movie, and they check their cell phones and their text messaging, 
[00:37:00]  and they're getting up 10, 12 times a movie to run out in the hall to run into another theater  because they heard this dude is there or this chick is there.  Yeah.  It's just a whole social thing that has nothing to do with watching the movie.  With actually watching the movie.  Get the drinking age down to 18 so these kids have something to do.  There you go.  Because then that means, you know, you'll be drinking at 15 again.  Yeah.  Like the good old days.  Like the good old days.  Let's say hi to Brian in Virginia. 
[00:37:30]  Brian, what's up?  Hey, I cannot stay.  The last movie I went to because of this kind of crap was Spider-Man.  And we had the most cliche family, everything.  The little kid, the cell phones.  I got so effing tired of it.  I literally pulled out a $20 bill, walked up to him and said,  if you just fucking leave, you can have this $20.  They all stopped, looked at each other, and like they won the lottery.  Okay, great.  That was the best $20 I ever spent.  Never thought of that.  Yeah, right on.  The Brooklyn theaters I went to, they'd probably rob me, though.  So if he has $20, yeah, if he has $20 to give me, he's probably got a lot more on him. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, or do they just take it and go, I ain't going nowhere.  Thanks.  And buy popcorn.  Yep.  Or some jujubes or whatever else young gentleman like.  Ammunition.  Yeah.  You guys, this just in?  Huge press release just released?  Oh, oh, I got this in front of me, too.  Yes.  How about this?  XM Satellite Radio surpasses 4 million subscribers?  That's unbelievable.  4 million.  We've been at this, I don't know, I guess we're heading toward eight months. 
[00:38:30]  Heading toward eight months.  When we first started with XM, I mean, the company was at like 2.2, something like that.  Like a little over 2 million.  Yeah.  It just shows you, when you're looking back a little bit, how fast this is really growing.  XM Satellite Radio, the nation's leading satellite radio provider, announced today that it exceeded  4 million subscribers last week, extending its significant leadership position in the  satellite radio industry.  By adding 1 million new subscribers in less than five months, XM is clearly the fastest 
[00:39:00]  growing satellite radio company, said Hugh Pinero.  XM has continued to increase its subscriber base at an impressive rate since its launch.  It took 23 months for XM to reach its first 1 million subscribers.  It took eight more months to reach our second million, six months to hit 3 million, and  less than five months to exceed 4 million subs.  Did you read this right here?  More than 70% of all satellite radio subscribers have XM.  That is an amazing stat.  There you go.  Oh yeah, when we talk about the little doggy company, it's not out of jealousy, trust me. 
[00:39:30]  We just know we're kicking their ass, and we want to make it perfectly clear that everyone  knows it.  They're looking for 5.5 million subs by the end of this year.  So this is huge news for the company today.  Hell yeah.  Huge, huge news.  That's a lot of potential listeners we got here.  Growing every day.  Mm-hmm.  70% of satellite radio subscribers have XM.  They're sitting on 30%.  They're sitting on 30% of the market with really shitty equipment. 
[00:40:00]  And 95% of the entertainment cost.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  That strategy's working well for you.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Bravo.  I read something on one of the Wall Street articles that said that Sirius is spending so much  money per subscriber that it's actually the more subscribers they get at this point, the  worse it is for the company.  The more subscribers they get, the more money they have to pump out in order to get and hold 
[00:40:30]  that subscriber.  Remember, that it's better for them to not get subscribers.  Who got the company into that mess?  That Martha Stewart move was good, though, man.  Because a lot of people I know, especially like buy stuff, we always say, I wish Martha  Stewart could be heard for a couple hours a day.  Yeah.  Talking about cooking and recipes and stuff.  Yeah.  That's going to be worth $7 million a year that they spend.  Yeah, sure.  That's a good move.  Martha Stewart.  The goal with this whole thing, in a business sense, is to make the cost of having one 
[00:41:00]  subscriber to be less than what that subscriber is paying.  And then you reach that point where you're actually profitable.  But it's costing them so much money just per subscriber that they can't possibly turn  this around in the foreseeable future.  All these big names just that have their own channels and don't do much.  I don't know if Eminem does anything on his channel, but what could he do?  He just plays the name.  Well, they bought his name. 
[00:41:30]  To hip-hop.  They were counting on Howard to just have the same effect he did back in 1990, and it's  just not going to happen.  It's just not going to happen.  He'll drive a bunch of people to satellite radio, which will help XM as well, but in  the end, it's not going to justify the cost at all.  Sure as hell ain't going to surpass XM.  No.  That's for sure.  No.  It's not the old day.  I mean, the guy had his huge moment, but the truth of the matter is, if he went out  to do a book signing now, sure as shit ain't going to be closing down blocks of Manhattan. 
[00:42:00]  Obviously, the guy would get a really good turnout, but it ain't going to be what it was.  Years ago, there's not going to be blocks of crazed fans with police holding him back  and stuff.  And I thought Mel was smart enough to know that, but obviously he's not.  Yeah.  Some guy last night at the Comedy Cellar goes, how come you guys don't go to Cyrus?  Cyrus?  Exactly.  That's what happens if you put two I's and a U in your company name, stupid asses. 
[00:42:30]  Don't even know how to...  With the logo, that doesn't make any sense.  It's just dumb.  Cyrus, it sounds like something you find on your foot, which is kind of like a crusty skin  thing.  Well, it's because it's the dog star, which is the brightest star in the universe.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, that's where all that comes from.  Is that what that nonsense is?  Yeah, but you'd have to be an astronomer to care.  But that's what their logic was.  Well, we'll name our company, uh, you know... 
[00:43:00]  Cyrus!  After the...  They killed Cyrus!  It was them, the warriors!  We'll name the company after the brightest star in the sky, which is the dog star.  And they figured people would go to buy a satellite company and then just go, you know  what, we should buy one which symbolizes the brightest in the sky.  That is just awful.  It's simple.  A-M-F-M-X-M.  Hello.  Just like the Hyundai guy said, makes it easy.  It makes it look good on the nameplate.  That's why we went with XM.  You like their helmets? 
[00:43:30]  All right, let's, uh, say hi to Eric in Pennsylvania.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, I was just wondering...  One shit at a time!  Go ahead, Eric.  I was just wondering about that.  You said you guys were kicking a little doggy company's ass, right?  Yeah.  I was wondering, was it the ass or the liver?  Oh, Opie.  Well, you should field that one.  There's a bunch of people I would love to kick in the liver, trust me.  I think that'd be a good little promotion for you guys. 
[00:44:00]  Maybe they can make that for your billboard.  You guys kicking a little doggy around?  There you go.  I like the commercial they have with the little dog in the car.  I love it.  So I'm trying to have, like, look at the dog and go, all the people are just automatically  associated with Sirius.  Your company name is difficult to say and aggravating to the mouth.  Dude, I was, um, really fast, too.  I was having dinner with my brother, who works on Wall Street, so he knows, uh, you know,  these companies inside and out.  And he knows a little bit more about this, uh, portable unit that they're coming out with.  And we already talked about it.  It has, like, two batteries, and it's so bulky and stupid that you can't even listen 
[00:44:30]  to, you know, uh, live programming.  You have to tape everything before you leave the house.  And my brother says, another thing that they didn't really want in the press release,  you're going to actually have to wear an antenna.  Stop it.  No, you're not.  Are you kidding me?  I swear to God.  Wear an antenna where?  Like, like, he, he made a sound, but, you know, he's, he's a, he's a goofball, too.  But he made it sound like you have to fucking wear the antenna. 
[00:45:00]  Like one of those Dan Rather on the convention floor, old 60s.  Pretty much sticking out of your head.  Yeah, pretty much sticking out of your head.  You got to look like, um, from the Starsky and Hutch movie when Starsky's jogging down  the beach.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With the headphones on.  Yeah, he was, uh, listening to satellite radio as he was running down the beach.  Yeah, listening to some cirrus.  Psoriasis.  Psoriasis.  Psoriasis.  Psoriasis.  Isn't that, uh, because they have no repeaters, right? 
[00:45:30]  They have, like, hardly any repeaters.  That's probably one of the problems.  It's hard to pick it up.  Yeah, they're just, uh, they're just a mess.  I understand, though, one thing I'll say in their defense, you get excellent reception  if you're on, like, 46th and 6th Avenue.  Right there?  You can hear it really well.  Yeah, park your car right outside there and just enjoy and laugh and listen to some rap.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, congratulations to the gang down there in Washington.  Big day for XM.  Over 4 million subscribers.  70% of the market.  That's just amazing.  With, uh, things around the corner that are just gonna blow people away. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  It's only gonna get better.  All right, we should take our first break, huh, Ant?  Mm-hmm.  Even Howard knows that this company's great.  Here's Howard talking about XM Satellite Radio.  Do you want to kiss me, or?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for the ride.

[00:47:00]  It's XM Satellite Radio.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Why wouldn't you see a doctor right away?  I mean, you need an operation and all that crap, right?  Because it was an insurance.  You know, who's paying for this?  I was like, you know what?  I'll fucking...  I paid 300 bucks a month for medical, so, you know, let me...  Go.  I'll go.  But it took me...  These doctors are so good, I guess, that, you know, they get a lot of shit. 
[00:47:30]  I guess a lot of people have ACLs that need to be fixed.  I don't know.  That seems like something just kind of...  It sounds fucked up, right?  Maybe gets it right away.  That should have been taken care of already.  I went to the guy that I'm going to see website, and then I called this other guy who was going  to give me an appointment the next day.  Yeah.  And he's got, like, a flat HTML page with a picture that his, you know, daughter took  at a picnic.  Oh, my God.  You're in trouble.  And then my guy that I'm going to see has, like, awards he won from Harvard.  Yeah.  And he's Asian.  Well, you need that.  I mean, I might wait.  You know, an Asian guy has got his shit together.  This guy's bald. 
[00:48:00]  Well, you know, he looks...  But can't it heal all fucked up?  Yep.  I don't know, dude.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Norton, did you just say yes?  It can.  How do you know?  Well, Kaiser Soze, I know what happened.  How do you know?  Your knees go backwards naturally, you flamingo.  You don't have ligaments.  I'm just amazed you haven't taken care of this yet.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm going Friday.  I can't.  You're going to be a gimbal.  I can't.  No, I'm not going to be a gimbal.  You might be.  I'm not going to be a gimbal. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, you're going to have problems the rest of your life.  He's got some fucking...  Dragging your foot.  Orthopedic white shoe.  Oh.  One sneaker, one white shoe.  One being dragged.  One heel bigger than the other.  Nothing's funnier than going out on stage with those metal crutches that go around your wrist.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I am alone.  Everything that I believe is fading. 
[00:49:00]  I am alone.  All right.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Four million subs and growing every day. 
[00:49:30]  Nice.  That is huge news today for the company.  Yeah.  God, this story about the runaway bride just gets better and better every day, huh?  Gotta love this girl.  Gotta love this girl.  She's a horny one.  Google-eyed whore.  She's a horndog.  I guess the latest, they're trying to say that she was headed to an ex-lover's house in New Mexico.  And love her.  This guy...  I'm trying to think how this goes.  This guy's sister and friend came out to see him. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Wait, no.  How does this work?  Because she was one of them.  He used to live back in their hometown.  Right.  Okay.  And they had hooked up there.  Gone on a couple of dates.  That was fixed up through family members.  Right.  Okay.  Oh, here it is.  About three years ago, she and my sister, okay, that's it, came out to New Mexico together  to visit me.  And I dated Jennifer a couple of times, he said.  Yeah.  And then he says that she liked sex. 
[00:50:30]  She was, you know, they had some hot and heavy sessions.  And then that was it.  She had a healthy sexual appetite.  There you go.  Num-num.  She liked sex, he said.  Eat him up.  So now they're speculating that she might have been on her way to try to, you know,  see this guy, to get banged.  Only two hours away from where he lived.  Right.  When she made that phone call to the police.  And, you know, when you travel across the country and you end up two hours away from 
[00:51:00]  an ex that you enjoyed your sex with.  It wasn't really an ex, by the way.  Yeah.  They went on like two or three dates.  And she did a few times.  She was real loose and just had a great time with this guy.  Yeah, that's what that was about.  So, you know, her fiancé back there, he had abstained from sex for 18 months during  their courtship.  Courtship.  What century is this?  And, uh, I guess she, uh, is he a virgin? 
[00:51:30]  The fiancé?  You gotta think.  The guy?  He's either a virgin or has had just, uh, minimal contact.  What an ass.  One of these religious types that, um, think it's a, you gotta save yourself for the marriage.  One of these religious, uh, do-gooders that thinks, you know, he could, he could, uh, show  her the, the real way.  You know, if you're one of these guys that assumes that you should save yourself for marriage,  your chick better be a virgin who is also saving herself for marriage.  Because you'll end up in a situation like this.  I keep going 18 months. 
[00:52:00]  I completely don't agree with saving yourself for marriage.  Oh, you gotta know what you're getting into, man.  Of course.  That's a pretty big part of things.  You need to test drive the vehicle.  Right.  You might, uh, you know, you might not, uh, be compatible.  He grabs you by the ears and shoves that in there.  And you gag.  That could be a problem.  What if her birth canal is too short and, and you can't get all the way in there?  Ooh.  You get halfway in and hear, ow!  You go, aw, damn it. 
[00:52:30]  Halfway in and you're hitting the back wall.  Ooh, what the hell's this about?  Hitting off the backboard.  Yeah, so, uh, she, she apparently wanted, uh, wanted a little more than, than, uh, the  fiance was giving.  She emailed another ex in St. Louis too before she took off.  Really?  She just wanted a hog show.  Of course.  Of course.  Because she went a while without, uh, sex.  She lost her mind.  Maybe she caught a look at this guy's mule or something getting out of the shower and  it was small.  Now, why would she do this, like, right before the wedding? 
[00:53:00]  Because that's the payday.  That's when they're going to go into the bed and, and, you know, have some sex.  Is she thinking, I can't do this after I'm married?  Ah, that's exactly what I'm thinking.  I think this guy got into her head and, uh, she's thinking, oh my God, you know, I got  to get it all out before I get married.  And she went into panic mode and she's, she's nuts to begin with and just started emailing  and figuring out where her, her conquests were.  Because I don't even think these are old boyfriends and decided one of these guys will  bang me hard before I get married. 
[00:53:30]  I hear the best man was disappointed because he had already gotten pictures of him having  sex with the bride and taped it to the bottom of all the plates.  And during the toast, uh, he was going to tell everyone to flip them over.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Like other men who've gone a few rounds with her, several firemen, a dentist, and gym buffs  among them.  Wow.  This guy said, uh, she had a healthy sexual appetite.  So they made it sound like they were the couple that was going to wait for marriage.  She was getting cold feet and she was getting cold snatch. 
[00:54:00]  She needed some hot cock.  Then she runs off.  They try to make it sound like some, some little storybook thing.  The innocent bride that, uh, was a little nervous and had a run.  No, this is, uh, this is a dopey fiance who hooks up with this woman who has this, uh, as  they said hefty, uh, sexual appetite and, and she ran off to get some cock.  That's it. 
[00:54:30]  Still getting married.  Did they say, I don't know.  Isn't she in a, like a loony bin now or something, right?  She went into something, but I think that was one of those moves to get the public off  of her.  Well, she was getting criticized and they were talking about billing her for the search  and maybe criminal charges.  And then you take the Pat O'Brien route.  You check yourself in somewhere and say, oh, okay.  They can't bill her for the search though.  She didn't tell them to search.  They actually can.  They, they billed some, uh, college student recently.  They, uh, this, this girl disappeared.  She had this story when she came back of how she was abducted. 
[00:55:00]  And then they have, they have videotape of her in a convenience store buying duct tape  and stuff that she used to tie herself up with.  Didn't she actually, maybe there's a difference.  Maybe she, did she stage that beforehand, like plan to get attention or something where  this chick just took off?  Um, no, they're saying that the, the college girl also planned it to get attention.  But this girl, she didn't just take off either.  She planned it in advance.  She had a bus ticket.  Planning to get attention, like wanting people to search for it.  Maybe the college girl wanted to be searched for and this girl just wanted to get away. 
[00:55:30]  Like, can they technically bill you if you just say like, screw this, I'm taking off.  I think if you file a false report like that, they can, they can bill you, regardless of  your intention.  Poor girl just wanted a little dick.  I wish an ex of mine, some chick I banged eight years ago, would get into this kind of  hot water.  I'd be all over the news.  Comes back.  You would be.  I would, and I'd bang her too.  I'd bang her while her face is on TV.  I'd let her give me a hummer and I wouldn't tell anyone until it was over.  This guy in New Mexico would have banged her too. 
[00:56:00]  Oh yeah.  But she only got two hours away.  But he was saying, they asked him what, you know, what would he have done if she did show  up?  And he goes, uh, he was quoted as saying, I would have turned her ass in and, uh, and  asked for that $100,000 reward.  He doesn't care about it.  He's just one of, one of the many chicks he's probably banged meant nothing to him.  I'm sure she's good in bed though.  Cause she has like, I like the fact that her head in this photo, the neck looks like your  Ops in the, in that one Photoshop that you hate.  Photoshop. 
[00:56:30]  Giraffe neck.  Oh my God.  With those eyes.  She's like E.T.  A scared E.T.  Oof.  Yeah.  She wanted to put her finger up and touch a big cock.  But that's the latest on her.  Just when you thought that this story was going away, there's another twist.  She has one bloodshot Googled eye.  Jizz got in there.  Hey, your eyes cleared up, Jimmy.  Oh yeah.  I've done that.  Yeah.  It looks good.  Yeah, I feel good.  Looking good.  All right.  Well, we can play a couple more of these today. 
[00:57:00]  What's that?  Well, the psycho ex-girlfriend voicemails.  Oh, nice bit's been nicely.  Nice little segue.  We'll just do a couple more today.  Where do we leave this bitch on Friday?  You could pretty much just say she's crazy, making phone calls to her boyfriend.  Yeah.  I don't know if she was in the, it's over, take it easy, I'll never see you again mindset,  or the please call me while you're doing this to me.  She was committed to moving back to Allentown.  Yeah.  Sounds like she was in Texas or something, and she wants her cat back. 
[00:57:30]  That's all she cares about is her cat.  Her cat, and she's saying that she's going to go out with some guy that asked her out.  Right.  So she's just done with this guy, Mark.  Yeah.  That's what she said on Friday.  Unfortunately, there's 23 more voicemails to go.  Yeah.  We'll play a couple more here today.  Let's go with this one.  Sage message, Thursday, 12, 25 a.m.  Mark, you know what, seriously, I don't know what is up your ass tonight, but it's 11.22 
[00:58:00]  my time, and if I can recall, you weren't even home at this time last night, and I've  been calling you now, and you're pissed at me, and you know what, it just isn't fucking  fair.  So you do whatever you want to do, okay, and you have a good night, because I'm going  to, and I want my cat back Friday night.  When I get into the airport, I'll take a taxi home, I'll get in my car, and I'm assuming  by that point, it'll probably be close to 9 o'clock, and I want to pick up my cat, and 
[00:58:30]  I'm hoping that even if it's going out of your way, I hope you make yourself available  to me, because I just want to get my cat, and you can go out for the night, you can do  whatever the fuck you want to do, because you know what, I don't care anymore.  If you can do this to me, you obviously don't care.  You can do anything you want, and then you can do it back to me, and it doesn't matter.  So, I just want my cat, and I want to move on.  Okay, goodbye.  All right, good news, Anthony.  Yeah.  Good news.  She seems a lot calmer.  She just wants her cat. 
[00:59:00]  I think it's finally hit her that this relationship's over, and she's calm about it.  She just wants her cat back.  She's getting realistic about the whole situation.  I feel a lot better about this broad.  Oh, sure.  Because over the weekend, I was feeling sorry for her, because she was losing a little bit  last week.  No, she's moving on.  She's moving on.  Let's go to the next one here.  Sage Message, Thursday, 8, 12 a.m.  Mark, I want to talk to you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And you know, we've talked about this before.  I said something stupid, and I didn't mean it. 
[00:59:30]  And you know that.  And I won't call you anymore.  But I'm sorry.  If anybody can understand it to you, I would think, I'm sorry.  And I just think the whole stupid thing, again, is happening.  It's stupid.  It's stupid, Mark.  It's stupid.  We want to be together.  And, you know, it's been a rough week.  And I'm sorry on top of it.  I do feel bad.  I'm sorry.  And I know how you feel, and I'm sorry.  But if you still don't want to talk to me, that's fine. 
[01:00:00]  And you'll get your money, and you'll get some on top of that.  And if you could find out a way for me to get my keys back, because I won't even be able to get in my house, that would be great.  But I love you, and I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone.  I didn't mean to disappoint you.  And that's the last thing I wanted to do.  So I wish you would just think of that and forgive me.  I'm sorry.  Okay?  Bye.  I'm apologetic.  All right.  Now she's sorry.  Did she say she was sorry?  Yeah, I think so.  Jesus, shut up already.  I alluded to it. 
[01:00:30]  But I like that she's calm.  And these phone calls today.  Yeah.  Because I couldn't really handle the crying ones.  Sage message.  Friday, February 16th, 8, 57, E.M.  And another thing to your voicemail.  You just lied to me.  You lied to me so many times.  You lied to me about that with her.  It's mind-blowing.  Untruthful.  Dishonest.  So, hope you're feeling good about that. 
[01:01:00]  Take care.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  She's losing it a little bit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You're hearing her voice.  Oh, boy.  It's a little shaky.  It's a little...  She's quivering a little bit here, Anthony.  Sage message.  Friday, February 16th, 8, 59, P.M.  You know, one last thought.  And, you know, yes, I am saying this because I'm angry and I want to hurt you back, but it  is the truth.  I guess this means I could finally have that date with Joe. 
[01:01:30]  So, you know, you know, the one I've been putting off?  I saved his number.  Bye.  Ooh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Now we got a lot of interest here.  Apparently, she wants to go see his U2 cover band.  Wow.  There's a little tease there, huh?  Yeah.  She saved Joe's number.  Hmm.  Sage message.  Saturday, February 17th, 11, 45, A.M. 
[01:02:00]  Well, we seem to have a little problem here, you and I.  I'm going to need you to call me back real soon because apparently you're stealing things  out of my house now.  What happened to the heart, the crystal decal thing, the heart crystal, the Swarovski crystal  that was on my countertop?  Where did you take that to?  That wasn't yours.  My brother bought that for me and now you're stealing things out of my home.  Joe, unless you want me to call the police and tell them that I need you to return the 
[01:02:30]  stuff that you stole from my house, however small it might be, it was significant to me  and I want that back.  And I don't know how many other things you stole from me.  So, we've got a little problem here.  So, I need you to call me back and return that to me immediately because, you know, don't  put it past me, Mark.  I'm fucking furious.  And I've had it with you and your stupid things that you do and it wasn't yours.  You had no right to take that.  You know what?  Take your fucking gifts if you want them back, but don't take fucking things that don't  belong to you.  You better call me back. 
[01:03:00]  So far, so good, though.  Yeah, yeah.  She's holding it together.  Kind of boring today, actually, these calls.  Here's a short one.  Saturday, February 17th, 1147 AM.  I'm fucking around.  You better call me back because you took stuff out of my house that is not yours.  It doesn't belong to you.  And that's something to call the police about, okay?  So, you better fucking call me back.  I'm not fucking around, Mark.  She's starting to threaten him. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, little threats.  The cops could be involved.  That's a problem.  Sage message.  Saturday, February 17th, 1156 AM.  No need to call me back.  All I can say is there better not be anything else missing from my house, asshole.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, she's going with the quick ones.  The quick ones.  Thank God, because there's 15 more to go.  Sage message. 
[01:04:00]  Saturday, February 17th, 1215 PM.  Well, just thought I'd let you know that you have a good day in my life.  After all your misery.  I just found out that my father's going into the hospital on Wednesday because he's already been diagnosed with prostate cancer.  And he's had cancerous cells removed twice before from surgery.  And they found more.  So now he's going in.  And we never know how bad it is or if it spreads until they go in and operate. 
[01:04:30]  So that's Wednesday.  So, I just hope you fucking leave me alone.  And don't fuck with me.  Because I've had enough.  And by the way, I'm definitely out of here.  I'm probably going to give it a couple months and depending on what happens with my dad.  I'm leaving.  Fucking up my life.  And continuing to fuck with me.  I just want you to leave me alone.  Because, you know what?  You never gave a shit about me.  And if you did, you wouldn't be treating me this way.  You wouldn't continue to break up with me and get back together and break up with me. 
[01:05:00]  You never fucking loved me.  How could someone who wants to marry me do that to me and continuously break up with me?  So just fucking leave me alone.  Leave my life.  Don't fuck with me.  Is he returning calls?  That's what I was going to say.  Leave me alone.  Absolutely he is.  He's still banging her, I bet, too.  You think?  Guaranteed, dude.  He's still, there's no way, because the thing she's saying.  How would you want any contact with this?  She must be great in bed.  Maybe she has a big meat pocket. 
[01:05:30]  She's all over the place, this silly goose, isn't she?  Yeah.  The police might be showing up very shortly.  I'm going to go see Joe.  I'm leaving town.  My father's asshole has to be cut out.  Did you pick one thing and obsess on it?  He's not calling her back at all.  He's not, because she's trying everything to get this guy to call her.  Yeah.  You know, you have my cat.  I'm going to leave.  I might go out on a date with Joe.  And he's not calling.  You're stealing stuff from my place.  I've got to call the police now.  Now my father's sick.  Right. 
[01:06:00]  She just wants a call back from this guy.  And he's not biting.  Saved message.  Wednesday, February 21st, 9.09 p.m.  All right.  Let me say this calmly.  I don't know what could have possibly upset you today.  Because I don't think I did anything wrong.  I really don't.  And I don't know why you're upset with me.  And why you called me all afternoon when I couldn't even get to my phone calls, let alone check my voicemail. 
[01:06:30]  My mother's been calling me all day, and she couldn't reach me.  And I guess that's my fault now, you know.  But you yelled at me when I called you to tell you about the phone.  You know, that was a problem.  So, okay.  I can't check my voicemails.  I can't take any calls.  That's a problem.  But yet, I tell you that's a problem.  And on top of it, you know, I don't know why you don't want to see me tonight.  So, once again, you're running away.  You're withholding.  And you're pulling back.  And you're torturing me.  And I don't know why you're doing this to me again. 
[01:07:00]  And I expect this phone call back because you said you weren't going to run away.  I don't get it, Mark.  I didn't do anything wrong.  What the hell did I do wrong this time?  And, yes, my father went home and they put him.  They sent him.  He got home.  They called the ambulance and they sent him back to the hospital.  And he's not doing well.  And, okay, whatever.  I don't know what I told you.  I expect this phone call back.  To read. 
[01:07:30]  She lost a little bit there.  Huh?  She lost it a little bit there.  What do you mean?  She started getting a little emotional.  Yeah, she's starting to lose it again.  Matt from Connecticut.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to tell you, I like your show.  And this is the first time I heard this thing with the crazy ex-girlfriend.  But I had one not too long ago that did the same thing.  She'd leave 10, 12, 14 messages a night when she knew I wasn't going to be on my phone.  And it's just great to hear somebody else.  Well, I feel bad that somebody else is going through the same thing. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, everybody's been through.  So, you know, I think everybody's gone through one of these where you get these calls and your messages are left.  Check your messages.  You got 15 of them.  Hey, Matt, you know what?  When you call a radio show, you've got to kind of listen.  All right, go ahead.  And Ant was going to kind of relate to you and say a couple things.  And then we were going to end with the big, whoa, how you got rid of her.  It would have been a nice little radio phone call.  No, I'm done, sir.  Go ahead.  See, but now he's done.  He doesn't feel like doing it.  And now this phone call is falling apart as we speak. 
[01:08:30]  Ant's feelings are hurt.  I'm annoyed.  I'm a little hurt.  See, when you guys call the show, we like to interact with you guys.  You know, Matt, I was just trying to give my point, and you just talked and talked and talked and wouldn't let me get a word in S-wise.  I'm sorry.  How do you do this?  I'm just trying to relate to your story, and you talked over me.  Is that asking too much to just want to be able to talk? 
[01:09:00]  Matt?  I apologize.  I'd like to interact with you.  Fuck you, and I want my cat.  All right, Matt, how did you get rid of your ex?  She was very religious, which is kind of odd because she was also nuts.  But, you know, she was always telling me that she's...  Why is it odd that she's religious and nuts?  Have you seen any of these religious people walk around your city?  They're all crazy.  They're all crazy.  That's true.  She was always talking about how she would pray to God to give her the answer and pray to God to tell her what to do. 
[01:09:30]  And so, finally, she got me on the phone, and I couldn't get her off.  So, I told her God talked to me, and he told me she should jump out her window.  Ooh.  So, I guess that either offended her or she believed it because I never heard from her again after that.  You know, when we're looking back at the week of radio shows on Friday,  this is going to be the phone call where we all agree it was the worst of the week.  Matt's call already on a Monday?  I guarantee... 
[01:10:00]  Matt, you got the worst call of the week, and it's only Monday.  I guarantee no one is going to beat Matt's phone call to his program.  Sorry about that, man.  No, it's not that bad, Matt.  So, what happened?  No, shut up, Jimmy.  Don't egg him on, Jimmy.  Let him take his beating and move on, and he'll learn, and he'll get better.  That's right.  The next time he needs to call.  Matt, are you new to the program?  Yeah, I just started listening not too long ago when you guys came on.  All right.  See, he's new to the program.  All right.  I think Matt did a fine job. 
[01:10:30]  Were you religious growing up, Matt?  Shut up, Jimmy.  No, Matt, shut up.  Matt, Matt, Matt, no, don't fall into his clever ruse.  This guy is good.  Matt, I wanted to know a little bit about you.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Yeah, no, I'm not a religious person.  All right.  My parents tried, but it didn't take.  At least you got rid of her, though, man.  Sometimes it's tough, right?  Shut up, Jimmy.  Thank you, Matt.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Hey, Matt. 
[01:11:00]  Let's go to Deidre.  Deidre, what's up?  Hi.  Hey, how are you?  Fine.  How are you?  Girl.  Good.  It's a girl.  A girl.  Hey, I just wanted to ask you guys if you had touched on the fact that all this madness  started going down right around Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they broke up for some reason.  Very touching to me.  I don't think, I don't know, I'm trying to figure out the backstory in this relationship.  It doesn't sound like it was a long one.  It seems like somehow they met because, I don't know, she bought a cell phone from her. 
[01:11:30]  From him?  Then they started cohabitating.  Then cohabitating.  And then she went to Dallas to be with him because she's from Allentown.  Yeah.  So maybe she went down there for Valentine's Day and it just didn't work out.  I don't know.  Well, it's odd that the cat doesn't have a name, too.  She wants her cat.  Right.  They just call it Cat.  And I hate that I love this now because it really grates on my nerves, but I got to hear what happens.  Yeah, it is really annoying. 
[01:12:00]  It's kind of like a soap opera.  Yeah.  You know what, which woman really annoys me is the one that announces the date at the beginning of every stupid phone call and she says February.  That really irritates me.  I didn't even notice that.  Her perfect pronunciation, that dumb operator machine.  Fade message.  Stephanie C.  Friday, 10, 57 p.m.  Perfect question.  I told you not, I'm going to give you a couple minutes to apologize because I don't know if you thought that was funny again, but it wasn't.  You fucking validated my feelings. 
[01:12:30]  You weren't listening to me.  You burst into a cheer.  And I'm supposed to just sit there and take it?  You asked me what was wrong.  I told you.  You didn't fucking listen to me.  In fact, you wanted to prove to me that you weren't and you didn't care.  Well, you did.  So, unless you need anything else, you better call me back.  I'm not fucking around, Mark.  I am so generous.  Oh, she is fucking around.  Oh, she is fucking around.  This is 37 calls we're up to.  Do we keep going or what? 
[01:13:00]  Or do we, uh...  One more, maybe.  One more?  I'd say so.  Then we have some, uh...  Oh, sorry.  Friday, 10, 59 p.m.  Okay, can you stop being spiteful now and obnoxious?  Because if you want this to work, if not, you're not listening to me.  You asked me what the problem was.  It's on my mind.  I told you.  She's rubbing the phone on her bush?  What's going on here?  You know, I'm just here trying to sand this table. 
[01:13:30]  They're playing Guess What's in My Mental Institution.  And then you don't listen to me.  So, while you didn't fucking ask the question,  I am truly and sincerely asking you,  I'm not going to be begging you anymore, Mark.  This is bullshit.  I'm not going to fucking cheese after you.  Chase after me.  Because you know what?  I'm fucking worth it.  So, I'm going to expect a call, like, in a few minutes.  Like, one or two.  And then I know that it's not really worth it to you. 
[01:14:00]  So, goodbye.  I'm going to bet that he doesn't call back.  I would think no.  In a couple minutes.  No phone call.  Now we've got to see if he calls back.  Sage message.  Friday, 11, 17 p.m.  You know what?  You're a fucking bastard.  You have no sensitivity.  And you know what?  When you do something wrong, you can't handle it.  And fuck you.  I'm fucking it.  You can fucking make me feel like shit. 
[01:14:30]  And you can't fucking feel good about it.  So, fuck you.  You've not fucking taken it to burn.  I'm fucking, freaking tired of fucking chasing after you.  Fuck you.  All right.  We're at the fuck you phase.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  Wow.  She held it together right up to that point where she gave him a couple of minutes to call back.  Apparently, I would say that he didn't call. 
[01:15:00]  And she got a little upset.  I have, have you heard the steamy, seedy description of the runaway bride's sexual encounter?  No.  With the Hispanic man and woman that abducted her?  This is from her story.  It's pretty, uh, it's pretty steamy.  What happened, Ed?  Well, let's see.  They talk about how she was jogging out on the evening of April 26th. 
[01:15:30]  Uh, she was grabbed by two individuals, a Hispanic male and white female, this is from the police  report, obviously, in a van and thrown in the back of it.  Her hands were then tied with rope.  The individuals placed her on her right side on the floor of the van and made her face the  back door.  The male then began driving while the female stayed in the back of the van with Jennifer.  After approximately 30 minutes, the male pulled the van off the side of the road and shut  the vehicle off.  She's all tied up and wondering what, what, why are we stopping? 
[01:16:00]  Can I jump in really fast?  Sure.  This obviously is her fantasy that she really wants to happen to her.  Absolutely.  This girl is so horny.  So horned up that the fantasy of an abduction has to include this little sexual, uh, thing  that happened.  All right, go ahead, Ed.  Uh, off the side of the road, the vehicle gets shut off, shut off.  The female took off her pants and underwear but left her shirt on.  The female then pulled down Jennifer's pants and underwear, performed oral sex on her and 
[01:16:30]  digitally penetrated her vagina.  So this, this couple abducts you and licks your pussy.  This chick rocks.  The, the girl takes her clothes off and starts going down on you.  Dude, this reminds me when I was a kid, this is, I, I had a bad thing of some, I, I was  actually walking and this girl with a really meaty vagina pulled over and made me get in  the car and jerk off looking at her and listening to Ozzy.  Right.  It was horrible. 
[01:17:00]  And then let you off.  And she's kicked out.  This is, this doesn't happen.  How about stabbed her in the chest a few times and shit on her face?  Ooh.  Ooh.  I'm going to take the band with the good.  Is there more?  Uh, of course.  Oh, good.  Pulled down and panted under her, performed oral sex on her and digitally penetrated her  vagina.  The female then moved over Jennifer's head and told her to perform oral sex on her.  At the same time, the male had gone to the back of the van.  He then removed his pants and placed his penis into Jennifer's vagina. 
[01:17:30]  According to Jennifer, she performed oral sex on the female until the female had an orgasm.  The male pulled his penis out from Jennifer's vagina once the female had an orgasm.  Jennifer was not sure if the male had ejaculated.  Uh, the female and male then dressed themselves and pulled up Jennifer's underwear and pants.  The male then moved to the front of the van and began driving again. 
[01:18:00]  Uh, Sergeant, uh, one of the sergeants,  asked Jennifer if prior to the van stopping, did the male or female make any comments?  Uh, Jennifer said they only spoke in Spanish.  Now, this is the investigator trying to trip her story up a little bit.  Uh, the sergeant also asked Jennifer if it was dark or lit in the area they had stopped  during the sexual assault.  She replied it was dark.  He then asked, if it was dark, how was she able to see the female and male removing their clothing?  Jennifer stated when she was...  Well, look at those eyes of hers.  She sees in the dark, of course. 
[01:18:30]  Of course she does, man.  Those eyes are adapted for the dark.  If only she thought of that.  She didn't say that.  Look at my eyes, you idiot.  You idiot.  Turn the lights out in here and hold up some fingers.  Well, these pupils don't move.  The investigator kept asking her questions.  She kept going, who?  He went, you.  What do you mean all you did was eat wise potato chips?  What are you talking about, miss?  I can't answer that, but I can tell you how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie 
[01:19:00]  Roll center of a Tootsie Pop.  What exactly did the female, um...  Let me see.  Jennifer stated, I lost my spot.  Where was it?  That's all right, Ann.  Take your time.  Wait a minute.  Because I still got the nice visual in my head of what she wants done to her.  I guarantee you this is what she did in Vegas with this couple.  Because she did hang out with a Spanish couple in Vegas.  Darker light.  Okay.  Jennifer stated, when she was told by the female to perform sex on her, the female placed 
[01:19:30]  her vagina over her face.  She could tell the female was only wearing a shirt.  Because I guess the shirt kind of...  Was hitting her in the head?  Was hitting her in the face.  A little bit.  Sexy.  As she was licking her pussy in this fantasy this woman had.  God, this guy better marry this broad.  Sergeant, uh...  He's got a lot of fun ahead of him.  The sergeant asked Jennifer, what exactly did the female state to you when she wanted  you to perform oral sex?  Jennifer said the female told her, now you can lick my pussy. 
[01:20:00]  The sergeant asked if the male or female made any statements to her while the sexual assault  was taking place.  She said, no.  The sergeant asked Jennifer if the male was wearing a condom when he penetrated her.  Jennifer replied, she did not know.  Would girls know that or not?  Not necessarily.  Feel a condom?  Let's hope not, because I've been pulling it off for quite a few years.  Yeah, yeah, it's on, it's on.  Sergeant asked Jennifer if she was bound by rope during the entire sexual assault. 
[01:20:30]  Jennifer said, yes.  And the detective asked if Jennifer had penetrated her with any force.  Jennifer said the male did not use any force, but he did not use any foreplay either.  I asked her if she was sexually assaulted at any other time throughout the incident.  She stated no.  After the sexual assault, they began driving again.  She told them she remained lying down and did not sit up.  And then she, uh, they stopped numerous times to get gas and junk food. 
[01:21:00]  She was dropped off in Albuquerque, where she made the 911 call.  So that's her little sexual fantasy.  That's the police report.  That rocks.  She told the cops, and the cops asking her those questions must have just known she was lying.  Look at the fact that the girl was sitting on her face.  That turned me on.  Yeah.  Look, I got like half a rod going.  That's really hot, man.  I like how it didn't include anything really bad, though.  Like, the guy might have been wearing a condom.  Didn't seem like he even came.  He was just, like, having sex with her until the girl came. 
[01:21:30]  The girl that was sitting on her face.  She's so good at oral sex that she made her cum.  And this kook is...  And then the guy just stopped.  This kook is going to marry this religious nut.  Because now I think he's nutty, too.  How about plowing it into her ass until it bleeds?  How about that?  Now, that's a rape.  That's not her fantasy, Anthony.  That's not her fantasy.  She's into the threesome.  Why didn't he put his uncut gift into her face when he was finished?  Right.  The husband-to-be had to read this police report.  He must have been out of his mind.  We'll pray together and hopefully get through this with prayer. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Pray together.  What you need to do is get another chick to squat on her face.  She's probably already licked some box in the loony bin.  She's been in a shower with another nut.  Room handles.  And they're scrubbing each other's faces.  Just one of them kneels on some flip-flops.  We heard they do that.  Yeah, we have.  Oh, the story just gets better and better.  Pretty hot.  That's off the smoke.  You know, the religious family had to read the police report going, oh, my God. 
[01:22:30]  They had to read everything.  Are you kidding me?  They had to read everything.  We thought our son found the perfect woman.  They don't want this woman now.  And now we're going to have to deal with this.  Just the fact that she had the ability to make up this perverted crap.  The family would go, oh, no way.  She did that.  She did that in Vegas.  I guarantee.  You think that's it?  She did hook up a Hispanic guy and a white woman.  That is exactly what she did.  And that's what happened somewhere.  She's probably a nympho that was trying to change her ways and then realized, oh, my God, I just can't do this. 
[01:23:00]  I need sex.  I need sex.  I need that cock.  I need the cock.  And just went.  Started contacting the old boyfriends.  That wasn't working out too well.  And then maybe in Vegas ran into a couple like this.  Maybe.  That's why you go to Vegas.  That is why a woman like this would run off to Vegas.  Where can I go in the United States where I could just probably hook up with a couple of people and have some sex? 
[01:23:30]  Ah, Sin City, Vegas.  There you go.  She ends up there, hooks up with this couple, Hispanic guy and a woman.  And they probably did exactly this.  She probably sat on her face.  Guy's banging her.  Oh, he probably had her legs pinned back.  Yeah.  Oh, just look at this owl-eyed whore eat his girlfriend.  Oh, God.  Let's say hi to George in New Jersey.  George.  Morning, guys.  Morning.  Hey, the cops knew this wasn't real the minute she said the other girl came on her face and the guy didn't blow a load. 
[01:24:00]  Exactly.  Stop it.  I don't know.  All right.  Big eyes.  Is that just hitting the press?  The police report finally?  I don't know.  It's on the smoking gun.  I don't know how long it's been here, but.  All right.  Let's go to Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass?  We love Ben's raw ass.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I got a little funny story for you.  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Is it a funny story?  Let's put our laughing hats on.  You guys ready for a funny story from Ben's raw ass? 
[01:24:30]  They're clapping and applauding in the other room.  They're ready to go.  All right.  I was trying to hook up with this religious chick once, right?  And so was my friend at the same time.  So she said she was going to have to pray to God to tell her which guy to go out with, right?  Yeah.  Needless to say, she didn't pick me, but she also didn't put out.  So he ended up raping her.  Wait a minute.  Is that actually...  I got to disagree with the boys. 
[01:25:00]  That was funny and hot.  Okay.  Good story, sir.  All right.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Funny story.  Hmm.  An interesting one.  Let's see.  Do-do-do.  I have a funny story.  Yeah?  It's a story about the intern who didn't come in and take my coffee order fast enough,  and he got a keyboard in the throat of his face.  Go ahead. 
[01:25:30]  Hey.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Wait, wait.  A, the line was awful.  B, I said keyboard.  Keyborn.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to regroup.  Let's do that.  That's what we do on this program, right?  We're going to do some more sex talk with that grandma after the break.  Hot.  Hot.  Some things to look forward to.  Get wet.  Sue Jo's recipe for a sexy shower seduction.  This is all sex advice from a grandma, Anthony.  Saran wrap.  It's not just for leftovers anymore. 
[01:26:00]  Ah.  Let me do it with saran wrap.  What are you bringing saran wrap in?  What?  A hot Carl?  A hot Carl.  A hot Carl?  Or the Cleveland steamer, as they call it?  I've heard it called a hot plate.  A hot plate.  Another one?  Hot lunch?  Yeah.  Hot lunch, yeah.  I think your face feels like a plate, I guess.  So you put the plastic on your face.  I wouldn't know.  And wouldn't that suffocate you?  What would rookies?  Rookies using any kind of...  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Please.  And then plopping it on you would probably feel like your hand feels when you have the  plastic bag on it and you pick up your dog crap from the sidewalk.  Would you let someone do that on your face with plastic on it?  Warm, steamy one on your face?  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  Make like a little mustache out of it and then just laugh out of it.  Oh, you can make things like a magna doodle where you're the face and since you got plastic  you can just make a big Raleigh Fingers mustache or a Groucho mustache or you can make big  eyebrows.  Sure.  That'd be fun.  Crafting little facial features with shit. 
[01:27:00]  A magna doodle.  All right.  Of course.  We'll continue with sex advice from the grandma, Sue Johansson, next.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the only virus.  Dedicated to Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite.  Right, Bill Gump? 
[01:27:30]  Nice round of applause, sir.  Shove it up, shove it up me.  Shove it up, shove it up me.  Shove it up, shove it up me.  Opie and Anthony.  Shove it up me.  Shove it up me.  Shove it up my hairy pussy 
[01:28:00]  Turn around to Bob.  Turn around and see if I might get away.  She's shoving it up her ass.  Alright, we're getting the guards, pal, Robert. Relax.  Look at that, huh?  Someone kicked that dildo right into her ass. 
[01:28:30]  Wait, you need to be on mic now.  Take your panties off.  I say, shove it up, shove it up me.  Shove it up, shove it up me.  Shove it up, shove it up me.  My hairy pussy, Opie and Anthony.  Hold down the pants for the big finale.  Big finale, here we go.  Down, down, down, down, girl. 
[01:29:00]  That just feels kind of sharp, pulling it down, you know?  I'm embarrassed and ashamed.  I'm really, my mother's listening.  My mother gets that sound.  Mmm, I said, shove it up, shove it up me.  Jim Norton and Robert Kelly.  Jim Norton and Robert Kelly.  Shove it up, Jim Norton and Robert Morgan Kelly.  Oh, I think she's got eyes for you, Bob.  I love you, Bob. 
[01:29:30]  I love you, Bob.  I know it's late.  Order the other side.  Shove it up.  Oh, shove it up me.  Oh, shove it up me.  Shove, I'm getting hot.  Uh-oh.  My pussy loves you.  Oh, God.  Oh, we're going to have a gangbang here.  Oh, I want to say, oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Of the morning.  Bob, take a sip of water.  We're losing Robert again.  We're losing Robert.  We're losing Robert.  Shove it up my hairy pussy.  You should have seen the guy sucking on that.  Oh, my hemloided asshole, too. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  Hey, Ben's over.  I'll shove it up you.  All right.  Very good.  Shove it up.  Anthony and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I've been tremendous, but I've grown my whole life.  This is the calling of the rest of our lives.  On holiday. 
[01:30:30]  Man, we got lots to do today.  So much, I don't even know where to go next, Anthony.  We got Paul Anka flipping out, which is actually really entertaining.  Always good to hear somebody that is always calm and collected in public, losing their mind.  Someone, some father yelling at his son.  I need the back story to this.  Let's see.  Oh, it's right on the CD.  Father goes to pick up son.  Son makes him wait.  Father flips out on son, calls him the C word, and screams head off for six straight minutes. 
[01:31:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Calls his son a C.  Yeah.  And then we got the grandma talking about sex.  You want to do a few of these first, and then we'll move on?  Oh, those are always good.  All right.  I love granny talking about sex.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I've seen this lady a bunch of times.  She got a lot of press because she's one of these hip grandmas that speaks openly about  sex.  She knows squat.  And she's on the Oxygen channel.  I guess she's from Canada.  Her name's Sue Johanson. 
[01:31:30]  And she's just awful.  And no one's willing to tell her that she's just awful.  Old Canadian broad.  An old Canuck.  It's like, look at the old broad talking about sex.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  How does she do it?  It's outrageous.  It's so outrageous.  But it's just bad.  Disgusting turnoff.  It's bad TV.  And then, yeah, we played a few of these last week, and she really doesn't know what she's  talking about.  No, she's giving bad advice, too.  It's bad enough to hear her talking about this stuff, but her advice stinks. 
[01:32:00]  Just lick the tip.  No.  When you grab the shaft, make sure you get a handful of hair and yank up and down.  There you go.  When guys are really hard, they love when you take their cock and bang it into third gear.  No.  All right.  Well, here she is talking about getting wet.  Sue Joe's recipe for a sexy shower seduction.  Oh.  I hate shower sex. 
[01:32:30]  Recipe.  It's awful.  Shower sex.  There's no lubricant, really.  It's just that, like...  Water's awful.  Because the water, it's the worst.  Water is an awful lubricant.  That's why pool sex doesn't work very well, either.  Never.  And like Anthony said on a past show, when you take a shower with someone, one person gets  the nice hot water, and you and your little body shivering in the corner.  You're freezing in the corner, waiting.  Waiting for your chance to get that warm goodness.  Oh, just looking.  Could you just splash some of that warm water over here, please? 
[01:33:00]  Could you help me out?  My dick is getting smaller by the moment.  Yeah, that's always good, too.  It's a little awkward.  You're standing there, and the water's running off your dick.  It looks like you're taking a leak.  You've got to have one of those cool showers.  Every once in a while, we're in a hotel where you've got the two shower heads.  That would be perfect for shower sex.  Big, huge shower with shower heads everywhere.  So you could just hang out and, you know...  You and your lady get the nice warm water on your back at the same time.  Not standing in the back of a little tub with the shower curtain blowing the cool breeze 
[01:33:30]  onto you.  Yeah.  Like, oh, all right, I'll wash my hair while you wash your body.  And I'll, okay, I'm freezing.  And now the soap is caking up on you because it's drying.  I take such hot showers that there's like a cold front thing that happens in my bathroom  where, yeah, I can't control the shower curtain.  I need blasting hot.  Yeah, and because of that, like the air is moving so quickly that the cold air is blowing 
[01:34:00]  in the shower curtain.  Is there anything worse than when the curtain keeps sticking to you?  That's what I mean.  Oh, that's the worst.  It lifts up on you and sticks.  It's like, beat it, curtain.  You could do your own weather...  Beat it.  You could do your own weather experiments in your bathroom.  It's just awful.  All right, well, here she is talking about sexy shower seduction.  What does she know?  She's probably got one of those plastic seats in the shower.  Yeah.  While your partner soaps up, you remove your diaper. 
[01:34:30]  What?  I was looking at houses over the weekend.  Yeah.  And there's some old couple in this house, and I guess they're moving because, you know,  the family's gone, and it's just them, and they don't want to knock around a big house.  So we're looking at the master bedroom bathroom.  Oh, God.  And I walk in, and it's just an old person's bathroom.  And I looked, and I saw that stool.  When you need the stool in the shower, it's like, oh.  The reality is they probably moved here like 30, 40 years ago when they were a hip, young  couple.  That's right. 
[01:35:00]  Time stinks.  Never thinking they'd ever have to buy that stool for the shower.  But there it was.  Oh.  Never thought they'd have to get handrails just to take a dump.  A handrail.  Oh, Jesus.  Time just stinks.  That's the worst.  Just to be able to take a dump on the run.  No one beats time.  Who are we kidding?  Time is king.  Ugh.  Kicks everyone's ass.  Ugh.  Moved in with their young kids and a dog running around the yard.  Guy had the big mutton-chop sideburns. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, you kids, damn it.  Get in here.  The mom's, you know, cooking dinner, and he probably walked up and smacked her on the  ass every so often.  Right.  Yeah.  Showering together.  Now they just sit around talking about all the medication they have to take to stay alive.  God.  God, life stinks.  Reading the paper.  Remember, reading the paper out in this sunroom.  Reading the New York Times because you want to still feel important.  Oh, but nothing in there matters to you in your life. 
[01:36:00]  That's just the worst.  That was it.  Huge house, too.  Yeah.  Like a lot, too many rooms.  Everywhere.  Rooms that, like, it would be great if you had, you know, six kids running around.  Probably remember hearing that, you know, kids running all over the place.  Considering you're going to have exactly zero kids in your lifetime, that would be a bad  thing.  I need a chamber of horrors that I can hang people up in and torture them.  I need a big house.  What if I got to sleep and there's someone wailing in pain in the next room? 
[01:36:30]  I need a big house.  I didn't see anything.  You know, I know we're going to go off on a tangent, but you had me laughing really hard  because Anthony, there's a lot of things Anthony hates, and I love when he talks about it.  He hates kids.  He absolutely hates them, and he also hates the Russians.  Russians, you know, I wouldn't mind them so much if they weren't every one of them exactly  the same.  There isn't a stereotype of Russians.  It really is just the way they all are. 
[01:37:00]  They are such self-important, because I was from the Soviet Union and came over here for  some reason, they're better than Americans, and they're constantly telling how much better  they are, and no matter what they do, it's better than what you do, and the dancers just  put it over the top.  You know, it was bad enough the guys talking that way, but the dancers that have come over  now, and every strip club you go to is now a Russian chick, that they have the sexuality 
[01:37:30]  of farm equipment.  There is nothing sexy about these Russian chicks.  They could, don't get me wrong, they could look very hot.  They could have beautiful bodies.  They could look very seductive and sexy, but when the second they try to move or open their  mouth, it's over, Johnny.  Make the good sexy dance for you.  I will make this sexy for you now.  If you give to me the money, oh, and then they do that bad dance. 
[01:38:00]  Like, you know, white people, they always say white people can't dance.  They are the uber white, where they are so bad at it, it just looks ridiculous.  And over the weekend, you ran into a Russian.  Ran into a Russian.  Ran into a Russian.  We go to look at a house, and you know, the things with real estate agents, just my head  explodes.  For some reason, the real estate agent that we're with is showing us the house, but there's  another real estate agent that has to be there. 
[01:38:30]  She wasn't there.  So we're just, you know, looking through the house.  We asked the woman that was there, I guess the housekeeper.  So we're looking through the top half of the house.  So this woman shows up, this other real estate agent, and it's a Russian woman.  And she starts saying, you are not supposed to be in here until I show.  It's like, the house is for sale.  We're just looking.  Believe me, don't worry.  We're not robbing the joint.  So we looked at the upstairs already, and she goes, have you looked at downstairs?  And we're like, no.  Okay. 
[01:39:00]  Come, follow.  So we follow her downstairs.  She goes, this bathroom, here, family room, that is door to outside.  When you leave, use gate.  And I'm stunned.  I'm looking.  I look at my girlfriend and start laughing.  I was laughing because it was like she barely showed us anything downstairs and then just  showed us how to leave the premises.  You're trying to sell the place.  So we're looking out in the backyard just going, okay, now go. 
[01:39:30]  You can leave now.  I'm talking in a Russian accent and just laughing my ass off that this woman who's supposed to  be selling this house for this woman is telling us pretty much, here's the gate.  Know how to use it.  Don't let it swing and hit your ass on the way out.  Unbelievable.  So, you know, obviously we weren't going to go for that house.  I love that.  Let's go to Tony in Queens.  Tony, what's up?  Here's the door to outside.  Gate.  Use it.  Go ahead, Tony. 
[01:40:00]  Have you ever noticed that these Russian people in Russia, mother of Russia, they were  all doctors, lawyers, engineers, and then they get over here and they're fucking custodians,  garbage men, whatever, man.  They have like no sense of humility and they're all arrogant.  They're just dicks.  They're very arrogant.  What it amounts to is they were a conquered people.  They were a conquered people.  It wasn't a conventional war.  It was a cold war.  But they were beaten and their way of life had to change because of it. 
[01:40:30]  Their country became very poor and a lot of them, when the gates opened up and they were  able to leave their country, came here to the United States.  And they feel this, I guess there's this deep down inferiority complex that they have that  they have to conquer by being superior to everybody, no matter what they do.  Sure, I, you know, I clean up your house, but I do it better than anybody ever could.  Well, they were brought up thinking that they were better than the United States, even though 
[01:41:00]  they were a communist nation.  So even though that now we're showing them, well, yeah, right, this way of life is much  better.  They, they don't want to admit that their life before they came to America was awful.  They always talk about what they did before.  This guy's right.  I was, uh, in Russia, I was a nuclear physicist.  Now, you know, okay, how many filters do I use for coffee maker?  What do you want?  You, uh, and the dance is, like I said, just unsexy.  Just stand there, strike a mannequin pose naked, and that'll work. 
[01:41:30]  Just them being naked.  The second they dance, or God forbid, try to talk, you buy for me the champagne.  Buy for me the champagne, I make this sexy dance for you.  Ugh, leave.  It'll smell like cigarettes.  Ech.  Let's go to Mike in Denver.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Mike?  So, so I hate, uh, strip clubs as it is, but I got drugged to one by my friends.  You got what, sir? 
[01:42:00]  I didn't hear you.  You got what?  I feel like I got drugged to a strip club by my friends.  I got drugged.  Drugged to a strip club.  I got drugged.  Yeah.  Why did you get drugged to a strip club?  It was a birthday thing for a friend of mine.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Bachelor party once.  I got dragged over to, uh, one of those clubs, and it was full of Russian chicks.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm sitting there drinking my beer, and this Russian chick comes over and goes, I'd  give you a lap dance.  I was bought for you by friends.  So she takes me behind the curtain for my little lap dance, and they play her song, which 
[01:42:30]  is Sweet Home Alabama, and she starts singing it to me.  Oh, God.  That would sound great.  And she's got this mechanical ass shake, which was horrible, and she goes, I'm actually  from Texas.  Yeah, Texas.  I bet you are from the Eastern Bloc, and you know it, and the thing that really killed  me was I'm getting a lap dance from a Russian chick singing Skinner's, and I'm a black guy.  That just stinks.  All right, I'm putting up.  Sweet Home Alabama.  Great. 
[01:43:00]  That's got to be sexy.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff.  Hey, fellas.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Why are you eating ice cream in the morning?  Oh, it's not ice cream.  Oh.  It's a Starbucks mocha chip frappuccino.  It looks like a sundae.  Very, very sugary, but I decided to treat myself.  I'm tired.  It's chocolatey, and it's got some whipped cream on there.  I asked for no whipped cream, but Travis is, it happens.  Uh-oh.  Is Travis doing a very noble thing, screwing up, knowing that we can't keep him on board 
[01:43:30]  so we feel better about letting him go?  We can't get on with him.  No, Travis takes this stuff seriously.  Travis didn't even ask if he could come in.  He just, yeah, busted right in.  Jimmy didn't want whipped cream on that.  No.  I asked you if you wanted whipped cream.  You said no, and then you said, yeah, yeah, you know what, yeah.  And I said, so you want whipped cream?  You said, yeah.  And then I left.  Did you say that?  No.  Look at him.  No.  Well, somebody's wrong here. 
[01:44:00]  Well, it's a misunderstanding.  Why would I not know what I wanted?  But you're sure you heard him say yes.  I said, yeah, for fat-free yogurt.  When you said fat-free, I said yogurt, and you said the fat-free, I went, yeah.  That was what I said yeah to.  Uh-oh.  That was the end.  Then it's my mistake.  Why are you eating?  Oh, man.  What?  You're eating all these dairy products.  That means we get a special little treat.  It makes him nervous.  I get scared.  I get scared.  We get a special little treat in about an hour.  Enough with the dairy products, please.  Are you really leaving? 
[01:44:30]  We can't find a way to keep it?  We're trying to figure it out.  We're trying to work it out, but Jesus Christ.  Why is it so hard?  I don't know.  If he's not going to school, he can't come here and just hang out.  How about this?  Bob Edwards wants him to stay.  Oh, there you go.  Or it'll be your lickety-split.  All right.  Thank you, Travis.  You're welcome.  I'm on Travis's side.  Me too.  I think he heard whipped cream.  No, I absolutely didn't.  I think Jimmy's freaking out over there.  Why would I freak out?  Lack of sleep.  No, no, no.  If I wanted whipped cream, who's Travis? 
[01:45:00]  He's not going to fall for that.  He's too good.  When I was working for a living, and I used to go to get breakfast in the morning, and  it was always two eggs on a roll with ham, cheese, salt, and pepper.  Every time.  Yeah.  Right?  And I would go to the deli and get it.  Same deli all the time.  And too many times to count, there was ketchup on it.  And I hate eggs with ketchup.  I cannot stand it. 
[01:45:30]  Scrambled eggs, maybe if I was starving, but eggs with like over easy, yolk and ketchup  mixing together, it might as well be, can I have a snot sandwich?  I don't like it.  I don't want it.  I would never order that.  And to have the guy behind the counter go, when I come back in, because I go to the van,  I would open it up and see the ketchup and go, son of a bitch.  Go inside and go, excuse me, like I cut the line and everything, excuse me, there's ketchup  on this.  And the guy would go, oh, you asked for ketchup. 
[01:46:00]  And I would look back and go, if you understood how much I hate ketchup and eggs, why would  I then ask for it?  Hey, could you come in my mouth, please?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you just do that?  They actually say that you asked for it.  No, I...  This is very fascinating, Anthony, but we have a big wig on the phone.  Of course we do.  Oh!  He can't be waiting.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Elo. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, boys.  It's been a while, Elo.  Elo.  What's up?  Hi, Eric.  Welcome back to the program.  Thank you.  I was starting to get a lot of fan mail from the virus nation.  Fan mail from some flounder?  Congratulations on your quotes in the Rolling Stones satellite radio article.  Thank you.  I just would like to also clarify a few things.  Oh, okay.  All right.  The sun will rise in the east and set in the west.  Oh, wow.  That's an exclusive from Elo right there. 
[01:47:00]  Eric and I did talk off air about the whole Rolling Stone thing because, you know, Jimmy's  been riding them really hard.  Yeah.  And I think, Eric, you know, it got to Eric a little bit, and we're talking about a bunch  of, you know, dumb things, and he's like, you know, I'm so pissed off because I talked  to Rolling Stone for a half hour, 40 minutes, just like you and I did.  And that's all they used.  I gave him so much stuff, yep.  Yeah, that's all they used.  And they told that.  One dumb line about it.  What was the line again?  I think it was something like, something to the effect of, at XM, we have channels that 
[01:47:30]  play hit records, and then we have channels that don't.  Or something.  It was some stupid line.  It was actually a really cool quote.  You said something about if you play, like, a lot of hit songs, people will listen.  People will listen.  As opposed to playing non-hit songs.  I thought it was a good quote.  Oh, you did.  You liar.  You know, it's fun to be in these national magazines.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But then when all you get is, you know, the first line of that article says, Opie and Anthony  can curse all they want now.  It's like they totally miss it. 
[01:48:00]  It's like they don't get the point of what we're trying to do here on Satellite Radio.  No, they don't get it at all.  But whatever.  So, big news for the company today, huh, Eric?  Huge down here.  I mean, we've got a party.  We've got a marching band in the parking lot.  We're grilling.  We've actually got a Ferris wheel.  It's fantastic.  It's a regular carnival going on there.  But is this $4 million thing?  Is this, let's be honest, is this actually going to surpass the Martha Stewart signing,  the amount of people she's going to bring on board?  Yeah.  Because they say fat middle-aged women are lining up with toasters. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, no, this is just actually portable units.  Sorry.  Yeah, no, it's a big deal, guys.  You guys heard you talking about it this morning.  It's great.  We're really excited.  It's, you know, I mean, clearly growing faster than anybody had ever expected.  We're growing faster than, you know, most other new technologies.  You know, we were the first to beat a million behind the DVD, but faster than CDs and cell phones and everything else.  So, I mean, it's just amazing, the growth, and it's just really exciting.  And I really don't think, to be honest with you, that the turbo growth, the real fast growth, as you'd refer to it, 
[01:49:00]  really isn't going to start happening until a later part of this year.  And, obviously, next year, you know, we've got Hyundai, as you know, that's coming on next year,  which is just going to be cranking out cars with XM Exclusive.  And then you have Toyota, who chose us as well, over that other, you know, seriesized, whatever you call it, Jimmy, company.  So, I mean, it's really exciting.  We had a lot of fun last week when they announced their portable unit.  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:30]  What are they doing?  Well, I think they should be, we said they should be getting those to the best buys in the circuit cities under darkness.  Just leave it at the back door and hope no one acknowledges how awful these things are.  Why would you send out a press release saying that you have a portable unit, but you can't listen to any channels live?  Yeah.  And that it's bulky and big and has two batteries.  And then my brother, at dinner on Saturday, was saying you actually have to wear an antenna.  Oh, that's just terrible.  You're going to walk around with a little satellite dish on your forehead. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  You guys have Toyota, too?  Should I, XMS Toyota?  What's that?  XMS Toyota, too?  Yeah, we did that deal before the Hyundai deal.  And actually, I think in the next three to four months, there's actually some cars on the lots that are starting to hit with factory install for Toyota.  And it's going to be in all the Lexus and all the Toyotas as well.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, 70% of the market we have, XM.  Yeah.  It's very exciting.  I mean, there's just so much great stuff.  And, you know, the interesting thing is that when you look at what's really happening with the growth and, you know, what is happening with Major League Baseball right now 
[01:50:30]  and what's happening with you guys and what's happening with, you know, all the other, the content that we've done, you know, people are coming to XMS satellite radio for more than just, you know, one thing.  They're coming because they want O&A, and then they discover baseball, and they discover music, and they've got this entire...  And Bob Edwards.  Bob Edwards is another great example.  You know, we've all heard the Kramer spot, of course.  No, Bob Edwards is not a great example.  You know that.  Now, listen, Bob Edwards had a big following. 
[01:51:00]  All right, let me explain this to you.  I'm going to educate you for once.  Explain this to you.  You educate me a lot.  I'm going to educate you.  Okay.  Explain it to me.  Bob Edwards was huge in the NPR world, okay?  He was.  All right.  But the problem is the NPR world is not a huge world.  It's a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny little planet.  It's that planet that we barely know the name of way out in the solar system.  Just outside of Pluto.  They're not sure if it's a planet yet.  That's the NPR world when it comes to the radio.  But it's a big world to the people in that world, though.  Right. 
[01:51:30]  If you're living there, that's your world.  It's your world.  It's got to be hundreds of people that are buying XM for NPR stuff.  But we're dealing with a solar system here.  That's right.  That's what Elon's trying to do.  It's not just on a planetary scale.  That's right.  We're made up of...  Just think about this for a second.  Think about our channel called N'Goma.  Channel 102.  Yeah.  It's African music.  Really?  You know what?  That's how you say that.  I see that on the...  I thought you were making up a channel, but then it hit me.  Because I do go through all the weird channels.  Yeah.  I've seen that channel, and I couldn't pronounce it until just now. 
[01:52:00]  Really?  It's called N'Goma.  N'Goma.  And what type of stuff do they play there?  It's African music.  It's African tribal-inspired music.  Wow.  And to those people, that small planet, that is their entire universe.  They're happy.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  You know, and it's funny, by the way, speaking of odd channels, have you guys picked up on  the...  Because, you know, we had the whole airplane scare down here with Lee Abrams driving over  the White House and everything.  Yeah.  Right.  Now, let me see if you guys can make this.  Do you know what the tail number is of his airplane? 
[01:52:30]  I know there's an XM in it.  Okay.  I'll give you the tail number, and then you see if you can figure out the connection here.  The tail number is N-1-0-1-XM.  So, now what I'll ask you is, given Lee Abrams and given what you know about Lee, what is  Channel 101?  The pot-smoking channel?  It's called The Joint.  The Joint.  Oh, The Joint.  Oh, okay.  You got to respect that.  Oh, God.  Really?  He rocks. 
[01:53:00]  Got that past the FAA, huh?  He rocks.  I just will never fly with him.  No, no.  I won't fly with him either.  No.  But it's exciting times here, guys.  You know, we'll pass five million.  We'll be north of five and a half by the end of this year, and, you know, we don't know  where our competitor is.  Nowhere to be found.  Well, I got one of your quotes that's hitting the wires right now.  Eric Logan says, now that XM has four million subs, there will be more people listening.  We had more people today than we did yesterday. 
[01:53:30]  So, have you guys hit on the fact about the Me 103 thing yet, or no?  No.  Where you can actually, where you, or you, because you guys already have a channel, but,  you know, a lucky subscriber and three of their friends can win an entire channel for 24 hours  where they can play and say and do whatever they want.  Ooh, Howard, Artie, Rob and Chop.  There you go.  Just go to xmradio.com and sign up.  It's right there on the front page.  Wow. 
[01:54:00]  That's pretty cool.  Get your own radio show.  Get your own.  No, no, no.  Not just show, channel.  Channel.  Channel for a day.  Channel for a day.  Channel for a day.  Yeah, we'll fly you here.  It's called Me 103.  It's all about you.  And, you know, they can, whoever wins can reach out and call you guys.  And you guys can come down and host a segment with them if you wanted to.  No, we won't be doing that.  I like that idea.  We're too big for that.  No, I'm just kidding.  We have our own show to do.  But I'm available, by the way.  We're trying to, you know, get this show going every day. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, the show's great.  We're not going to give our A material to some listener out there.  Some listener and three of his friends.  Right.  Any big announcements on the way?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You know me.  I always got something in my bag.  Come on.  Give us a little tease.  Something.  I'm always sitting in my bag.  A little tease.  What's in your bag?  Well, my big bag today was the Me 103 thing.  That was my big thing today.  Yeah.  That was my big thing today.  And, of course, $4 million.  $4 million, that's nothing small.  Now, I think Hugh is actually in Manhattan today.  Oh.  So you should be looking. 
[01:55:00]  He may be popping by.  Deal going down?  No, no.  He's up there for the $4 million, doing a lot of TV, a lot of press, a lot of media.  Very, very cool.  Yeah.  So it's very great.  It's very exciting.  Glad you guys are here.  Just enjoy the ride.  And how are you personally going to be celebrating the fact that XM hit 4 million subscribers?  Tonight?  Oh, God.  You are awful.  Oh, click. 
[01:55:30]  Just picturing him sitting there looking at that phone receiver going, motherfucker.  The beautiful thing is he hasn't looked at it yet.  He is still going through the...  How he's celebrating tonight.  You can actually hear him go, well, tonight he's geared up and was ready to go.  And I saw...  He actually had an answer.  Oh, God.  That was awful.  As he's asking the question, I see him looking at the green things to make sure he has the  hang-up button lined up correctly.  I'm like, oh, Eric, don't answer. 
[01:56:00]  Oh.  That was funny.  Just say nothing.  I got nothing going on.  Wow.  Oh, you are bad, man.  Oh, that makes me happy.  Every chance I get to do that.  I think he's calling back.  Let's go to Scott in Illinois first.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Give me your opinion on the new family guys.  Hate it. 
[01:56:30]  They are doing nothing for me.  As a matter of fact, I'm enjoying American Dad much more.  It seems like they're giving American Dad more latitude with risque material.  What's wrong with the new family guys?  I was never aware of that.  I hate it.  I don't know what's going on.  I think because of the whole new climate and the FCC and that stupid Janet Jackson who  should be assassinated for being a dope.  This is now what you're seeing over a year, year and a half later.  It's watered down shit on these networks. 
[01:57:00]  It just seems like these episodes are kind of the throwaway episodes that you never really  want to watch twice on the first three seasons.  I don't know what's going on.  I don't know if they gave up on Family Guy and then last minute the network decided to  bring it back so they rushed this into production.  Because, I mean, the other show, what is it, American Dad or whatever?  Yeah.  That's a much better show.  So it's almost like his whole production company decided to focus on this new cartoon  and then last minute they said, no, we're going to bring Family Guy back as well. 
[01:57:30]  And I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  There's no Stewie.  There's no real interaction with all the characters in the family.  Yeah.  I'm not digging it at all.  But I just wanted your opinion.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Punching out.  Yeah.  I don't know what's going on, but it's just watered down.  You know, the shows are very similar, too.  The two shows.  Yeah.  Which is very similar.  And it's hard to do two shows, which makes me wonder what was going on.  Like, you know, I think they were only going to do the one.  And then last minute, you know, Fox said, no, let's get some Family Guy episodes back, too. 
[01:58:00]  Imagine us having to come up with this shit twice a day.  Right.  Yeah, because it looks like they took all the characters, just reworked them a little bit  and threw them into American Dad.  Yeah.  Which doesn't make sense unless that was supposed to be the only show that they were going to,  you know, produce.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, we should take a break.  But very disappointed so far with the Family Guy.  Very disappointed.  I mean, everyone's, you know, through a half-hour episode, there's a few chuckles, you know,  maybe five minutes out of 30 minutes, sure. 
[01:58:30]  But it just seems like the quality is way down and the whole thing is watered down in general.  Ooh.  Did you see that scene in American Dad last night where it was like a...  I missed it.  Oh.  I didn't even see American Dad last night, actually.  The dad's looking at a picture of his wife when they went to some beach.  And she's in a bikini.  And he goes, this is the only picture of her where you can't see Vag.  Yeah.  So...  But Vag turns out to be some, like, helper boy on the beach. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, God.  You can't see Vag.  But they get away with that.  Right, right.  And for some reason, it looks like they've tamed down Family Guy a little more than that other show.  Yeah.  Do you think they did it to keep the shows different?  Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Like, maybe, well, we don't want the tempo or the tone to be this.  There was such a buzz.  There was just a few episodes so far.  You can't...  I don't think you could just...  There was such a buzz with Family Guy coming back that I'd be amazed that they purposely toned it down. 
[01:59:30]  You'd want to, you know, put out your best material, right?  I mean, maybe they already had these done.  And they did Family Guy after.  And, like, ugh, would we want to do the same thing we're kind of doing?  I mean, I was just guessing.  I don't know much.  Yeah, there's a back story.  There's a story.  I don't know what it is, but it'll probably come out.  Because, you know what?  I was even thinking when we were talking to...  What was her name?  The chick?  Paula Abdul.  Oh, man.  Alex Borstein.  Alex Borstein.  Yeah, Alex Borstein and Seth that day. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  I just got the feeling in general that there wasn't this overall excitement that Family Guy was coming back.  Almost like there was some stuff going on behind the scenes.  Really?  Yeah.  I just got a weird feeling.  I'm like, wow, where's the real excitement that this show is finally back after being off the air for a few years?  I don't know.  All right, we should take a break and we'll continue with the O&A show.  On the phone line, if you could hold through the break, is Pepper from Corrosion of Conformity.  He was supposed to be on the show on Friday.  And rumor had it he was missing and there's a happy ending to the story, I guess, where he's going to let us know why he missed the show on Friday. 
[02:00:30]  Hey, this is Joe Perry.  This is John C.  This is Brian Regan.  This is Charlie Murphy.  This is Lois Griffin.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is Larry the Cable Guy.  This is Flavo Flav.  And you are listening to Opie and Anthony.  The Valerius.  The Valerius. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, that's New C.O.C., right?  Off of In the Arms of God.  And Pepper's on the phone. 
[02:01:30]  No one's in the studio right now.  I don't know where Opie and Jimmy went.  I guess they're peeing together.  They love peeing together.  You guys love peeing together, man.  You just can't wait to jump up and there's no way we're back on.  Yeah, I know.  We just left.  That was really quick.  That was really fast.  Wow.  That's what I said.  Wow.  We really have weak bladders.  I pay a lot.  Everybody knows that.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  That's custom.  Where are we?  Come on.  You guys couldn't help us out and give us a longer break?  I just gave C.O.C. the big sell.  Nice.  Love the C.O.C.  We go way back with C.O.C.  Oh, yeah.  The old W.A.A.F. days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Played a few blasts back then.  Pepper, what's up, buddy?  What's going down?  Pepper Keenan from C.O.C.  Yeah, you're right.  Do you remember us from A.A.F.?  You can be honest.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A long time ago. 
[02:02:30]  We used to do a lot of shows with you guys.  I know.  You guys were one of our faves back then, man.  We're doing a big time now, man.  Can we do something with them at Momikin, I think it was?  We did a lot of stuff with Pepper.  Nice.  Do I have to explain what happened on Friday?  Yeah, we were really hoping for you to come in.  We haven't seen you in a while.  And next thing I know, Ben is handing us a note saying Pepper is missing somewhere in New York City.  They busted down his room, the door to his room in his hotel.  And they saw some, like, chick in his bed. 
[02:03:00]  And that's all they knew.  You know who that chick was?  Huh?  That was me, face down.  The stupid lady assumed that I was the woman, I guess because of my beautifully long hair.  That's awful, man.  Do you have a hairless ass, too?  It was me.  And I had made the mistake of flying to New York and leaving my phone charger at home.  So my freaking, my cell phone was dead.  So you didn't wake up for our interview or whatever.  You were going to come over here.  I think you were staying right across the street. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, I was ready to go, man.  And then all of a sudden they went into panic mode and what?  I mean, they were calling friends of mine in New Orleans to get, like, running buddies in Manhattan's phone number.  Oh, shit.  It was hilarious.  And, you know, I'd been out in Manhattan the night before.  We were running all over the place.  But I was ready to go.  But the lady, security woman or whatever, assumed that I was a woman, obviously thinking that some guy with beautiful blonde hair wouldn't be the singer for COC. 
[02:04:00]  Jeez.  Did you have the, was the sheet pulled up on you?  I had no idea, man.  I'm lucky I wasn't button naked on the floor.  Well, maybe then she'd know it wasn't a chick.  She really probably would have thought it was a woman.  There's a woman with a cock in this room.  Yeah, it wasn't sounding good on Friday.  It was funny, man.  Everybody would have completed in the panic mode, but I was up and at them.  Well, it didn't help that a national talk show was basically saying that Pepper's missing.  Because that's the info we got.  Pepper's missing and there's some chick naked in his bed. 
[02:04:30]  There's a dead chick in the bed.  Yeah.  I think at one point we did say that.  She wasn't moving.  We're like, ah, it's rock and roll.  What are you going to do?  We've seen this story before.  You're right.  We've been down that muddy road.  I got to tell you, I haven't seen you in a while, Pepper.  And I was watching Some Kind of Monster and I was rooting for you.  How bad did you want to be the bassist in Metallica?  That was some crazy stuff, man.  I mean, those guys that kind of had secretly under the radar been wanting me to do it for a while at that time. 
[02:05:00]  And it was between me and Trahia, you know.  I knew it was going to be tough because he is a damn bass playing monster.  But I think he couldn't sing quite as well as I could.  So I thought that was kind of an ace in the hole on that end of it, you know, because the backing vocals are pretty important to James.  Yeah.  But in the reality of it, once I got in there behind closed doors, I was like, man, I don't really know if I want this.  Really?  Yeah.  Was it a little, they were a little crazy, huh? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, just, I mean, just in terms of the whole musicianship thing and the way they operate nowadays, you know, it just wasn't quite the way I would do things.  I just loved Some Kind of Monster because it exploited what this band has become.  It's just one big business, which is, you know, whatever.  It happens all the time.  But then when you see a therapist like that dude.  I kept calling him Dr. Phil and he didn't really like that.  Well, he was just an older dude and these guys were just listening and hanging on to every word he had to say. 
[02:06:00]  I guess at that point in their career it might have been important.  I don't know.  I mean, I just saw James recently and they seemed like they're back to their normal selves.  You know, but shit, man, people argue.  People don't always get along.  It's just the reality of life.  You can't fake it and understand all the issues that they have.  But it's, you know, that was a big time thing.  And if I think if I would have gotten a gig, you know, I mean, they needed, they didn't need me. 
[02:06:30]  They needed some, they needed a yes man in that band.  That's what I was just going to ask you.  They don't need another Headfield or another Lars in there and that's what would have happened.  Yeah, I was just going to ask you that.  If you did get in, I doubt you'd have any say over what goes on, creatively especially.  Yeah, and that would, you know, obviously my ego couldn't have handled anything remotely close to that.  You know, there's no way.  Wow, did you think, though, going in that you might actually have a say in things or was it just kind of make some Metallica money? 
[02:07:00]  I wouldn't have done it, you know.  No?  Hell no.  There's no way.  You know, in terms of songwriting and stuff, I'm not a genius, but I think I'm pretty good at it at this point in the game.  But the Metallica money's got to be kind of nice.  Yeah, I mean, I never would have changed my life, you know.  It's not the kind of person I would like to think that I am.  Yeah, but you know something?  A million bucks.  I mean, come on.  You've got to be human, too.  A lot of people say that.  You know, you've got to compromise sometimes your artistic credibility against making some money. 
[02:07:30]  And, you know, a lot of people, I don't know.  Well, see, what happened when the whole thing went down, they were filming the whole time.  I went there twice.  I was there for quite some time.  And they were filming the whole time, and they wanted me to sign a release form.  So they said I had said a lot of intelligent things and blocks.  Everywhere you went, the camera was on you.  And I told them, I said, hell no, man.  If I don't get this gig, nobody even knows I was here.  You know, I'm not...  Everybody else was calling out Rolling Stones, saying they were auditioning for Metallica and all that shit. 
[02:08:00]  And I didn't even give a crap, you know.  I was like, I'm very happy in my other bands, man.  You know.  Damn.  This is not going to change my life.  And then they called back at the end and really wanted me to be in there because they thought it was important.  You know, I agree with it to a degree.  But I was definitely not using it as any kind of catalyst or selling point, you know.  No, you've got stuff going on.  Yeah.  So I was fine with it.  But I think in the long run, it turned out best for everybody, you know.  I probably would have been initially happy, you know. 
[02:08:30]  But I think as things would have gone down the road,  I would have not realized what I would have given up musicianship-wise or musically.  Right.  Personally, you know, because I've got my hand in a lot of different things.  You know, I wouldn't have been able to deal with that.  I wouldn't have been Pepper Keenan anymore.  I would have been the bass player for Metallica.  Right.  Basically.  Pepper, you're a huge fan of Motorhead.  Yeah.  There's an old quote here.  Lemmy is to metal as Johnny Cash is to country.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  We got to hang out with Lemmy in L.A.  We just did like an hour and a half of radio with him where we just talked shit.  It was really interesting.  Yeah, he was talking about aliens and all sorts of fun stuff, man.  He's quite a guy, man.  You know, that guy's like, you know, he's a cultural icon.  I mean, he definitely made rock and roll turn, you know.  Not many people are going to say that as one person, you know.  It's a lot of fun to drink with him.  Oh, yeah.  I'll tell you that.  That man knows how to put him down.  He's in good shape, too, man.  It's crazy. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, I never, you know, I never actually sat down and talked to them at length.  And I thought he was completely burnt out.  No.  But the guy is pretty sharp and very funny.  That goddamn English humor.  Yeah, yeah.  He's up there, man.  He's 60 years old or some shit like that.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's no kid, man.  He's fucking amazing.  Dude, is there any better song than Love Me Like a Reptile?  Love Me Like a Reptile.  I got to play Overkill with him on the last night of the tour. 
[02:10:00]  Really?  Which is pretty outstanding.  I told Lemmy I felt like the little ball-headed kid with cancer in the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  Hey, did you see when they were on The Tonight Show and they sang Ozzy's Hellraiser?  I didn't see that, no.  Yeah, it was great, man.  But let him put Lemmy on The Tonight Show.  You know, he wrote a lot of songs for Ozzy.  Yeah, I think he wrote Hellraiser, actually.  He wrote a couple of the huge hits.  No More Tears.  Yeah, No More Tears, that's right.  That's the one he wrote, yeah.  I had no idea until we talked to Lemmy that day. 
[02:10:30]  Yep.  And you were really good friends with Dimebag, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was rough.  Is it going to change how you tore, you think?  No.  I mean, if I was to let it do that, I think Dimebag would slap me over the back of the head.  Yeah, I hear you.  Get the fuck up.  What the hell are you doing?  Yeah, that whole situation was just weird, like a friggin' soap opera, and then...  Yeah, it's just...  I mean, I don't know, man. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, the way I perceived the whole thing was a different take.  You know, and I just think that in terms of a lot of bands and musicians out there, not  talking about Daryl at all, but there's a lot of negativity out there, and people use  that as a catalyst to write music.  Yeah.  I think sometimes in this day and age, it can send the wrong messages, man.  All it takes is one shitbag loose cannon out there to direct their anger.  Oh, yeah.  I hate the rappers, too, man.  It just doesn't make any sense, you know? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, I hear you.  But he was quite a person, man.  There's no doubt.  If not a day that goes by, I don't think about something crazy-ass shit that fool did.  Right on.  Well, the new desk is called In the Arms of God, the single Stonebreaker, and you guys  are going to hit the road, obviously, huh?  Yeah.  We go back out June 1st or 2nd, I think, starting in Indiana, and we're doing 49 shows  in the United States.  Hey, wait.  Were you guys just on?  Were you guys just playing with Motorhead in L.A. for the 30th anniversary?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:12:00]  I actually was at that show, and I was backstage, but I got there late.  I got there.  I didn't see you guys.  I didn't get to see Jericho.  Oh, these guys are amazing.  That was a good show.  It was like backstage.  It was like a who's who of heavy metal people.  There was so many 80s metal guys.  I had my camera.  I got fucking everybody, Dio, Rudy Sarzo.  I got my picture taken with Dio.  Yeah, I bothered him, too.  I wasn't sure if it was him.  I'm like, he's just a tiny little fella.  You want to pick him up and just kiss him.  He's a little fucker.  He's a super nice guy, man.  He was great.  He was really great.  Yeah.  Yeah, and all the voice comes out of a body like that. 
[02:12:30]  He's a powerful vocal.  Yeah, I was asking him all kind of questions.  It was grilling him, and he was just sitting there.  We were sitting there and talking.  I was asking, what the hell were you all thinking when you did Mob Rules, man?  I mean, come on.  You didn't like Mob Rules?  I loved it.  Oh, okay, yeah.  My favorite, you know, that song itself was just the most powerful thing.  I was like, man, you guys must have been freaking out when you heard it come back to the speakers.  I'll be honest.  On that album, I would take Country Girl or Sign of the Southern Cross, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  And I preferred Heaven and Hell to Mob Rules, but I still like it. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, Heaven and Hell is incredible, too.  All right, let's go to Howard in New York.  Hoo-hoo.  Howard, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I fucking love COC, man.  You guys are the fucking best, man.  There you go.  Thank you very much.  I go way fucking back to, like, Techocracy and Animosity.  Nice.  We're doing some Animosity songs on this next tour.  Oh, it's fucking awesome, man.  Yeah.  But anyway, open the anthem.  You guys should, like, get fucking anthrax to, like, fucking get that whole spreading the disease or virus thing there. 
[02:13:30]  You should fucking get anthrax in there and write a fucking song for you because, you know, they got that spreading disease song and shit.  A little tie-in.  That would be fucking cool.  A cool tie-in and shit.  But anyway, I'm punching out fucking COC fucking rules.  That's all you wanted to say?  I thought you had a question.  Nah, nah.  I just love fucking COC.  Dude, I love COC, dude.  All right.  That's cool.  No worries.  Let's go to Dave in Queens.  Dave, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Yo, did you get to speak to Phil at all since, you know, he wasn't allowed at the funeral at all?  I just wanted to know if he's still alive. 
[02:14:00]  Phil Anselmo from Pantera?  I've been fucking to Phil in a long, long time, man.  But what's the reason?  Why wouldn't they allow him to come to the funeral?  I think it's kind of fucked up, don't you think?  It's hard to say, man.  I don't really know.  I went to the funeral regardless, you know?  Yeah.  You have to ask Phil.  I mean, obviously, there's some tension between the Abbott family and Phil, you know, and I think it might have been perpetrated by the press, but, you know, I don't know. 
[02:14:30]  I got you, man.  I got a hand, you know, things were said about each other, mean things, spiteful things that, you know, hindsight were completely stupid.  Yeah.  I'm smoking a blunt for you guys.  There you go.  Nice.  Have a good day.  All right.  I got to tell you, one of our highlights was talking to Phil at OzFest a couple years back.  That was great.  Oh, he was so freaking adamant.  On what, on down or super joint or?  Was he in down?  I think he was in down.  I think it was down, right?  Uh-huh. 
[02:15:00]  You were in that band with him, no?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, why didn't, we would have loved to talk to you that day as we go back with you, but  they brought Phil over.  He couldn't even walk by himself.  Yeah.  He looked like.  The stories he was telling, man.  He looked like Weekend at Bernie's, man.  His eyes were behind these sunglasses.  They weren't focusing on anything.  He looked like he was dead.  I swear to you.  It was like 100 degrees and he's wearing like a winter cap.  Yeah.  I haven't spoken to a dude in quite some time.  Oh, man.  But one of the, he told us death is overrated and all sorts of fun little things. 
[02:15:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Death is overrated.  Death is overrated.  Right.  All right, Pepper.  Always a pleasure.  It's been a long time.  Maybe you should come in when you guys are playing.  Yeah.  We'll be back.  We'll be playing in New York on the 10th of June, I believe.  Yeah.  Irving Plaza, June 10th.  Anybody wants to check out our dates, it's on our COC.com.  Okay.  Very cool.  We're going out with Crowbar and a band called Alabama Thunder Pussy and a band called Weed  Eater and then Fu Manchu on the West Coast.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  It's going to be cool.  All right.  Thanks, Pepper.  All right, brother.  There he goes, Pepper from COC.  See you.  Good.  Wasn't a chick at all.  It was just him and his golden locks.  See?  I'm not the only one that's made that mistake.  Try to wake him up and grab that big back.  Yeah.  Hello.  Wake up.  Happens.  All right.  People are reminding us that we were going to talk about Sue Johansson, the grandma.  Right.  The grandma.  And the sex advice from that show she does on the Oxygen channel. 
[02:16:30]  Here's a clip from the show, Anthony, where she talks about her recipe for a sexy shower  seduction.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We were talking about showers an hour ago on this show.  No, we get sidetracked, don't we?  All right.  Let's get back on the road with this clip.  And here's this week's idea to spice up your sex life.  A shower with a difference.  Now, you light candles all around the bathroom.  And you burn some incense.  And you plug in your favorite romantic CD. 
[02:17:00]  And you lure your partner into the shower fully clothed, except for shoes, of course.  Kill them.  Lure them in and hit them with a hatchet.  How do you lure someone into the shower?  Lure.  Lure.  Lure.  Lure.  Lure.  Lure.  Lure.  Lure.  Lure.  Do you break out the old yu-hoo?  You know what you have to do?  Through the doorway.  You have to just put your, stick your arm out there and then do the come hither thing  with your finger.  Right.  And go, yoo-hoo. 
[02:17:30]  How do you lure someone?  Lure them.  Actually, how about place rose petals on the ground leading to the bathroom?  And you as that dummy is like, oh, what's this?  What's this?  I better follow the trail.  Oh, fully clothed, she says.  Why fully clothed?  Except for shoes, of course.  Then you undress them button by button.  Unzipped and unhooked. 
[02:18:00]  Now you start by kissing them all over.  Take off the girdle.  You lick, you suck, and you whisper sweet nothings.  Or you make animal noises.  Under the circumstances, I'd suggest dolphin noises.  When you're peeling off those wet, clinging undergarments, you can pretty well count on  it.  It's going to get steamy.  Animal noises.  You'll probably end up on a soggy bath, Matt, in the middle of the floor. 
[02:18:30]  Sounds like fun to me.  No, it doesn't.  Oh, it does not.  Stinks.  These pseudo-sexy things.  These things that are supposed to be sexy.  That are sexy in movies.  Button by button.  You're just sitting there going, take my fucking clothes off.  Yeah.  Put a little lip cream on the nipple.  Arrgh.  Yuck.  Make animal noises.  Stop it.  I wish I could do a billy goat.  That would be a fine one to do. 
[02:19:00]  Make a billy goat noise while someone's eating your ass.  Dolphin noises.  Who can make a dolphin noise?  She was trying to be cute and funny.  Yeah.  Of course.  How about a whale noise?  You know that low thing you're doing when you're getting blown?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Make that look like you're going down on that, girl.  Jeff on Long Island.  What's up?  Last time I saw a good shower scene, something roaring in was Pony Montana with a chainsaw and  Scarface. 
[02:19:30]  That's a shower scene.  Be good, guys.  She's rubbing them in.  She's rubbing your stomach.  She goes, now they're laying, huh?  That isn't sexy.  That old broad doesn't know anything.  Well, why don't we try another clip from her show, Anthony?  Her voice is awful, by the way.  She has, like, a lisp.  A weird, like, lisp.  Well, she's got the, uh...  I want to lick you.  Yeah, baby.  Touch my dick. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, you like that, don't you?  Wow, you're talented.  All right, I'm just going to reach around and grab your pussy.  Wow.  Oh, you're good.  You're two at the same time.  Ho, ho, baby.  Ho, ho.  Easy.  Suck that cock.  Whoa.  There she goes. 
[02:20:30]  She's swimming away.  Oh, I was waiting for the motorboat.  Yes.  Wrap her in duct tape and plastic.  Then, ever so sexy, throw her over the side.  And make sure you tape it all up.  Otherwise, that little fella's going to pop out and say,  ruin your trip to Mexico.  Want to try another one?  Let's try another one.  she talks about saran wrap Anthony it's just it's not just for leftovers anymore

[02:29:00]  and she goes into the chest and and kind of reviews uh these things  all right  this time around she reviews the aqua erotic massager  oh  so it's called the aqua erotic  and it looks like your average garden variety hard vibrator  but this one is different  you can fill this one with hot water  not too hot folks be gentle now  or cold water  to give different sensations  and it gives a whole new meaning to priming the pump 
[02:29:30]  you can even add food coloring just for fun  what's fun about that  a couple  what is fun about that  hey it's a blue cock  what is fun about a food coloring  besides staining your sheets  and having to get them washed  sooner than you want to wash them  you have water all over the place  nothing fun about that at all  food coloring  it stinks 
[02:30:00]  prime the pump  a couple of hours  and and it has a battery  it's battery operated  and it really doesn't do a thing  i mean the water  i guess adds heat or cool  but other than that  it's a vibrator  pure and simple  that's all it is to it  the water jiggles  but nothing like  it looks like  in the commercials  and after spending  a couple of hours  at the computer  writing this week's script  i had a stiff neck  and tight shoulders 
[02:30:30]  and there was nobody around  for a massage  so  i put hot water in the tube  and i sat there  rubbing it around my back  and guess what  it worked  well no  i did not have an orgasm  but it sure  took the kinks  out of my shoulders  see she used it  as a little  massage thing  help her shoulders out  oh my god  oh my god  she doesn't use 
[02:31:00]  any of these things  something tells me  she doesn't have sex  she's not a sexual person  but she's  kind of telling everybody  what they should be doing  she's not trying  that thing out  shoving it up there  prime the pump  oof  um  there's a bunch of  different food coloring  color nuts like easter eggs  what does that mean  color nuts  what's going on

[02:32:00]  the hell is with this  damn what are you doing  food coloring  color someone's balls  like their easter egg  there you go  i didn't actually get it  there you go  maybe you hide one ball  in a shoe  the other one behind the lamp  the cocks in the middle  hey what do you want from me  want to do one more here  of course  all right  adult material  how to explain explicit images  to a child  why would you do that  because how else  are you going to get them  on your lap  thanks michael jackson 
[02:32:30]  jesus  a child to her  is probably a man of 40  so it's probably not the same thing  we're moving on  we're going to talk to travis  hi travis  hello miss sue  hello how are you  fine  good  my wife and i have a  six-year-old daughter  yeah  and we were moving recently  and she accidentally found a box  of adult magazines  yeah  and we explained to her 
[02:33:00]  she already looked through a few of them  before we knew what was going on  yeah  we explained to her  that's how we make babies  and  and she accepted all that  but now a few weeks later  with an amount  she can look at them again  okay  ah  and i don't know what  should we  let her look  not let her look  tell her it's wrong  i don't know what magazines they were  and i don't know how explicit they were  but um  i would be a little  if they're pretty explicit magazines 
[02:33:30]  i would be  very uncomfortable  letting  your  little daughter  look at them  um  i would be very uncomfortable  looking most of them  so what i  um  would do is  just explain to her  look honey  um  those are for big people only  you know how there's some books  that you can't read yet  because you can't read that well yet  right  well  these are books  that are designed  for big people  for adults  they're not designed

[02:34:30]  but it's a big book  and it's a picture book  for kids  and then you  take it home  and you sit down  and you read it to her  and read it  and she may want to hear it  four or five times  that's fine  you read it to her  and explain the pictures  it's a beautiful book  okay  where do i come from  okay  great  thank you  thank you very much  you're very welcome  we actually have that book  in the studio  yeah we have the  african-american edition 
[02:35:00]  yeah  anything good in there  jimmy  um  the first thing  is this book  is all about you  and has a mocha colored baby  with white feet  oh  with the white little  bottoms of their feet  white bottoms of the feet  so the uh  uh  different ethnic backgrounds  can relate to their children  with that book  right  this is uh  we wrote it because  we thought you'd like to know  where you came from  and uh  anyway  before we wrote this all down  we asked some boys and girls  your age  where they thought they came from 
[02:35:30]  and one of the answers was uh  god this sounds like a bit  for the cause  when the cause had that  no i'm not saying  where the cause had that  dumb show  where they talk to the kids  oh  oh  kids say the darndest things  yeah i'm not trying to set you up  for a bit  it just sounds like uh  you know  what the cause would do  it's the african-american edition  all they did was uh  take the other book  and just rip out  any reference to a dad  nice  well here's what some of the kids said  um 
[02:36:00]  i was brought special delivery  by the stork  how did that rumor get started  by the way  that's actually how kids  were delivered up  back in the olden days  no idea  who came up with that  dumb one  somebody who thought  sexual parts  were filthy dirty  and didn't even want to get into it  uh  another kid thought  that the cat brought me in  one night  oh there's a picture  on the next page  of  naked  cartoon people  wow  and look at the  the black dude  with a tiny penis 
[02:36:30]  doesn't he have a small slong  oh  and look at her  big fat black woman  with the boobies  hanging out  two in a tub  in the middle of the room  with a ducky  in the middle of them  uh  dad got me from the saloon  saloon  mom found me at the hospital  i was a christmas present  from the fairies  look at that other one right there  uh  ben ate sushi  and then  shat me out  now it shows the naked couple 
[02:37:00]  standing up  is there a part  where they have sex  do they show that in  uh  animated style  well they show like  a naked man and woman  and it's like  first of all  you'll see that the man  has a flat chest  but the woman has  two round bumps  on her chest  these bumps have a lot of names  some people call them  the bosom  which you say like this  bosom  other people call them  titties or boobs  and then says 
[02:37:30]  don't ask us why  are you supposed to read this  to your kids  yeah then you got a kid  suckling on a boob  then the whole thing  about the breasts  and what they're used for  let's see  when you were just born  your mother's breasts  were rather like  a mobile milk bar  for the first few months  of your life  the only food you could eat  was milk  because at that time  you didn't have any teeth  so you couldn't eat  hot dogs or hamburgers  or french fries  or candy or anything  couldn't eat fried chicken  you had to drink your food  there won't be any 
[02:38:00]  fried chicken or titty milk  I guess  well the milk  that keeps you alive  for those first few months  either came from a bottle  or your mother's breasts  welfare's paying for it  you eat it  so it's a quick thank you  to breasts  before we move on  take a look further down  the pictures  you'll see that  just below the middle  the woman spreads out  but the man doesn't  oh  does it come to a point  where they talk about  actual having sex  yeah well it talks  about the hips  you want to hear  about the penis  sure 
[02:38:30]  but the important thing  to notice is that  the man has something  hanging between his legs  that the woman  doesn't have  all you boys have one  and yours will grow  bigger as you grow bigger  and it shows a picture  of a tiny little tot  with a tiny little penis  staring at it  going what the fuck  is going on down there  white bottoms of his feet  again  they show the little  black baby with the  large penis  and the white male  with a comparable  sized penis  and he's boo-hooing  let's go to Ken  in Connecticut 
[02:39:00]  Ken  yeah what's going on  dude  what's up  hey Professor Anthony  I thought you would  know this one  but the stork  and the baby  yeah  there's a correlation  between it  it's kind of dumb  but I'll just say it  quickly  back in the older days  when a baby  would arrive home  they would heat up  the house  and the house  or the heat  would be  or Jesus Christ  I'm nervous  but the stork  would land on  the roof  to keep warm  it was attracted  by the heat  so there's  a dumb correlation  really  yeah 
[02:39:30]  hmm  I'm not buying  that one sir  check it out  check it out  I'm serious  I learned that  in econ class  oddly enough  yeah but I heard  I've heard that  rumor dispelled  come on Jimmy  alright we gotta  move on with the  story here  alright sorry guys  thank you sir  the beginning of a  baby Anthony  what happens is this  let's say the man  and the woman  are lying in bed  together  this part often  happens in bed  because a bed  is so nice  and comfortable  sometimes it happens 
[02:40:00]  in a car too  in a back alley  in a back alley  did you show the woman  warming up  with a little  mouth to bag action  the man loves the woman  so he gives her a kiss  and she gives him a kiss  and then they hug each other  very tight  and after a while  the man's penis  becomes stiff  and hard  and much bigger  than it usually is  it gets bigger  because it has  lots of work to do  is that what it says  yeah  and the mother  is trying to come up 
[02:40:30]  with excuses  but the father  won't let her go  because he pays the rent  god damn it  and the mother  is a whore  who wants to be  thrown into a van  and have her face  sat on by a white lady  while a Puerto Rican  sticks it in  with or without a bag  by this time  the man wants to get  as close to the woman  as he can  oh he definitely does  because he's feeling  very loving to her  and to get really close  the best thing he can do  is lie on top of her  and put his penis 
[02:41:00]  inside her  into her vagina  yeah  making love Anthony  yeah  here we go  this is a very nice feeling  for both the man  and the woman  he likes being inside her  and she likes him  being inside her  it's called making love  because it all starts  with the man  and the woman  loving each other  really  that's what it starts with  love  sure does  where's that part  where they show the man  meeting the woman  and pumping drinks into her  and then hugging her  from the back  in his Saturn  and making love to her 
[02:41:30]  yeah  and trying to fertilize  that egg  but he misses  and actually gets it  all over the floor  because he doesn't want  to knock this psychopath up  yeah  it starts with love  it's a difficult feeling  to describe  but if you can imagine  a gentle tingly  sort of tickle  that starts in your stomach  and spreads all over  that will give you  some idea of what it's like  and as you know  when you're feeling tickly  you wriggle about a bit  yeah  it's just the same here  except it's a special  kind of wriggling  it's easier to understand 
[02:42:00]  when you realize  that the parts  that tickle most  are the man's penis  and the woman's vagina  so most of the wriggling  happens down there  and sometimes her butt  once a month  her throat will wriggle around  when daddy doesn't want  to get copper stained  all over the sheet  he'll make mommy's tonsils wriggle  because they used to wriggle  when they dated  and then she stopped wriggling  and once that ring  went on her finger  so daddy 
[02:42:30]  daddy wants to wriggle her  into a boat  oh man it gets better  the man pushes his penis  up and down  inside the woman's vagina  so that both  the tickly parts  are being rubbed  against each other  it's like scratching an itch  but a lot nicer  yeah  this usually starts slowly  and gets quicker  and quicker  as the tickly feeling  gets stronger and stronger 
[02:43:00]  tickly feeling  then the mommy talks  and ruins daddy's fantasy  because he's pretending  that she's anyone  but who she really is  why does the tickling stop  you might ask  oh  now you may be thinking  if it's so nice  why don't people do it  all the time  there are two reasons  first it's very tiring  more than playing football  or running or skipping  or climbing trees  or almost anything  good as it is  you just can't do it 
[02:43:30]  all day long  and the second reason  is that something really  that the cops show up  and the second reason  is that something  really wonderful happens  which puts an end  to the tickly feeling  and at the same time  starts the making  of the baby  oh  when the man and the woman  have been wriggling  so hard  you think they're both  going to pop  they nearly do just that  all the rubbing up and down  that's been going on  ends in a tremendous  big lovely shiver  for both of them  oh a shiver huh 
[02:44:00]  you're in a perfect world baby  again it's not easy  to tell you what this  feels like  but you know how it is  when you have a tickle  in your nose  for a long time  and then you have  a really big sneeze  it's a little like that  that's right  daddy blows snot  into mommy's vagina  like when you have a sneeze  and mommy takes it  in her mouth  and swallows it  mommy takes a face  full of blood boogers  oh  this is where it gets hot 
[02:44:30]  at the same time  a spurt of quite thick  sticky stuff  comes from the end  of the man's penis  and this goes into  the woman's vagina  it sounds just like a sneeze  because his daddy's coming  he's going  hate you  hate you  well believe it or not 
[02:45:00]  this sticky stuff  is how you and I  and all of us started  it's called semen  and in the semen  are sperm  yeah  and inside is DNA evidence  which will eventually  get daddy convicted  when they find it  on the dress  of a 13 year old  you gotta ruin everything  it's a cute little story  for kids  it's a beautiful moment  here Jimmy  the romantic sperm  there's a whole chapter 
[02:45:30]  on the romantic sperm  Anthony  romantic sperm  each drop of semen  is actually made up  of hundreds and thousands  of smaller drops  of sperm  which you can only see  under a very powerful  microscope  and what they get up  to is quite amazing  after leaving the man's  penis  the sperm  make their way up  the woman's vagina  like tiny tadpoles  swimming up a stream  what they're hoping  to find is one of the  eggs that the woman  produces inside her  every month  there it is  if one single sperm 
[02:46:00]  meets one single egg  they have a romance  of their own  this is called  fertilization  and the result of it  is the beginning  of a baby  the result of it  is you losing  any fun in life  whatsoever  unless daddy leads  an alternative lifestyle  then that sperm  will wriggle  and wind up going  face first  in a log  and then instead  of gaining weight  he starts losing weight 
[02:46:30]  a very magical thing  happens  daddy puts on a robe  and has friends  visit him a lot  the beginning of  three special letters  HIV  and then it goes on  and on  and on  explaining what happens  every month of the  pregnancy  until this little  tot is born  that's about it  sometimes  that sperm's efforts 
[02:47:00]  you're going to get  mommy turned into  an anchor  and this  will negate  everything you just read  well Dave from Arizona  has a good question here  go ahead Dave  yeah I wanted to know 
[02:47:30]  if it said anything  about the woman  falling asleep  and the man  giving himself  an angry pirate  sometimes  the sperm cells  the semen  has a love affair  with an eyeball  trying to fertilize  your eye  just poking into it  bam bam  looks like an egg  bam  I wonder  if your eye  got all red  Phil in New York  what's up  hey Norton  there's a third reason  that tickly feeling 
[02:48:00]  stops  when the lady  knocks on the door  and says the hour's up  the wiggling  and wriggling  stops  that's right  let's go to  Cliff in Oklahoma  Cliff  what's up boys  what's up  hey I was wondering  in the book  does it talk about  the man  trying to talk  the woman  into giving her  50 bucks back  and just leaving  later  these guys pick up  on every little  nuance of this show  oh there you have it  then there's the scene  where the hour's  almost up 
[02:48:30]  and daddy is wriggling  and he looks up  into that expressionless  Asian face  and finally decides  to release all  of her stomach  before she fucks up  another L word  oh my head hurts  I have a headache  wriggling  that was very informative  she gave some good  advice there  for the kids  that book  yeah sure 
[02:49:00]  the old broad  she seemed to enjoy it  we rarely take calls  from Wyoming  let's see what Clint has  Clint what's up  Clint  yeah  what's up buddy  hey this is uh  I just want to tell you guys  you guys kick ass  and rock  thank you  alright  thank you Clint  and I also want to say  Tommy Lee  is a bitch boy  motherfucker  oh the good old  oh you heard the  Tommy Lee thing  thanks for that  yeah he sucks ass  alright  thank you mister  but they've been doing  some good things lately  they were on

[02:56:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We forgot to talk about Gamefly.com before the break, Anthony.

Some people get pissed off because we're doing live commercials, but I don't think it's  that big of a deal.  Shut up.  That's what I say.  It's usually for stuff we believe in and it's, you know, we just gave them an hour of radio  and I'm sure I'll have email later.  Why are you guys doing live reads?  Dude, dude, I don't pay for it. 
[02:58:00]  Shut up.  It's one stupid commercial and you know what?  It's a good service and, you know, people will get turned on to that and maybe save some  money.  Whatever.  Whatever.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We could go a couple different places.  It's kind of slow in the news today, so we're kind of screwing off.  All I want to say about the news today is, I don't know if this is for today or not, but  Billy Crystal getting annoyed that people's cell phones were going off.  Oh, right.  At his one-man show.  I got to say, people, I really hate the public.  How do you not know? 
[02:58:30]  And Billy Crystal really annoyed me.  To get me to sympathize with Billy Crystal is amazing.  How do you assholes not know to turn off your fucking cell phones during a Broadway play?  During a live show, man.  Oh, it's bad enough in the movie theater, but at a live performance, when now the performance  is going to be affected?  At the movies, the movie ain't going to change if a cell phone goes off.  You're going to be annoyed and stuff.  But at a live show, the actors, I don't think they appreciate the brrrt, brrrt, and then 
[02:59:00]  somebody yapping.  Well, he said, in the second act, the material gets very personal and darker, and it deals  with the death of my parents.  It's hard material to do.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm at a point where I'm just about to talk about the first passing and brrrt, brrrt,  what you just said.  Yeah.  And this guy doesn't get it because he doesn't want the audience to know he's the schmuck,  so he lets it ring, and this happened 12 times.  12 times.  By the sixth one, Billy said, look, folks, this is tough material to get through.  If you want to talk on the phone, go talk on the phone. 
[02:59:30]  We'll put the lights on.  Turn them off.  I'm going to leave for a second and collect my thoughts.  He walked off.  He walked off.  To a big ovation, because it really is aggravating, and I really respect him for doing that,  because it's different than doing stand-up where you can just kind of address it.  You know, when you're telling a long three-hour fucking story, you've got to kind of  do it a certain way.  Okay, so he gets off, he comes back, it starts again.  I mean, you...  How does it start again?  You dummies out there, turn your phones off.  The whole reason he left the stage was so everyone could shut their goddamn cell phones off, 
[03:00:00]  and it happened again?  Was someone fucking with him?  They're just dummies.  People are just stupid.  Look, you want to know how stupid the public is?  Monster-in-law, $24 million.  That's all you need to know.  The J-Lo, Jane Fonda movie.  We are a nation of fucking morons.  Yeah, of dummies.  Absolute.  If you actually saw something that said monster-in-law, and you allowed your fat date to talk you  into going, you should be shot.  It's not as fun as Monster Rain. 
[03:00:30]  Monster Rain has more artistic integrity than watching this traitor play a cranky mother-in-law.  What happened?  Your new son-in-law was in the military, and you sat on an enemy tank, did you?  You bitch.  Now, that would make a good movie.  Oh, she makes me sick.  Have her son is over there in Iraq, and the mother goes over there and actually chops people's  heads off with the Al-Qaeda. 
[03:01:00]  It was a fun little movie.  Monster-in-law.  And she says that they are not being mistreated, the POW, so of course they're, you know, continue  to be tortured because she's saying that they're not.  She should just have been executed.  Treat her.  I love that guy that spit in her face, too.  I love you.  Big wad of tobacco.  I love this guy because he didn't even chew tobacco.  No.  He only chewed it to spit in her face.  You know how much you have to hate someone to hold tobacco juice in your mouth?  For the first time, you're on that line just, oh, this is awful. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, thanks.  Why can't this line move faster?  Grab the book from him.  She grabbed the book from him.  Hello.  Whap.  Right in a dumb face.  There you go.  Monster-in-law.  Sign that.  Whore.  Monster-in-law.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Trying to think.  We got the father.  I love that.  Yeah, I wonder where that came from.  And we got the Paul Anka's really good, too, though.  Yeah.  Not many people know who Paul Anka is, but... 
[03:02:00]  What?  A lot of people know who Paul Anka is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Name one song.  I know who he is.  I couldn't really tell you.  I know he wrote a lot of songs that he didn't sing.  Bridge Over Troubled Water.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Who wrote that?  I don't know.  I just made that up.  That was Simon Garfunkel.  Simon Garfunkel.  No, I...  Because I wouldn't have known if he wrote that.  Didn't he write the Tonight Show theme?  Did he?  Hey, Eric, why did you have this? 
[03:02:30]  Can I ask you?  What is this?  Oh, that's pretty cool, too.  The...  He wrote My Way, too, didn't he?  Yeah, he wrote My Way.  I'm talking about songs he actually sang and made popular.  There's not many, are there?  Diana?  Let me hear a little Diana. 
[03:03:00]  I will be at free, as the first up is my dream.  Oh, yes, get my beat, Diana.  All right, enough, enough, enough.  CBS FM. 
[03:03:30]  Turn it off, turn it off.  Ron Lundy here.  Turn it off.  Thank you.  Well, this is pretty cool.  Sometimes, you know, we play these songs until we get to the hook, and sometimes it takes forever.  Well, that was the hook, the Diana.  I know, we finally got there.  It took forever.  Is there another one?  This cute number you might remember.  Which one is that?  I like something.  Having my baby? 
[03:04:00]  Having my baby.  Oh, yeah.  What a lovely way of saying how much you love me.  Having my baby.  What a lovely way of saying what you're thinking of me.  I can't see it.  When you said stewed tomato.  I can't see it in your eyes.  All right, that's awful, too. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Dude, I laughed for a week over I told you to leave a stewed tomato on the floor.  How about this one?  Biff, take your goddamn hands off her.  Put your head on my shoulder.  Hold me in your arms. 
[03:05:00]  Baby.  Ball, I know.  Squeeze me oh so tight.  Show me.  It was big when that granny was actually fucking.  But you love me too.  All right, enough, enough.  I like this.  Enough.  Jesus.  I like that one.  We can do it all day.  Yeah.  It's a good song.  So you get the idea.  Didn't you write Times of Your Life, too?  Oh, yeah.  The old Kodak commercial theme song?  Yeah.  Good morning yesterday. 
[03:05:30]  Everyone remembers it.  You wake up and your wife has drifted away.  And suddenly it's off.  Isn't this the song playing in Christmas Vacation?  When he was up in the attic, no?  Looking at the old films. 
[03:06:00]  Do you remember?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  You remember the times of your life. 
[03:06:30]  Weird memories.  I don't know.  Paul Anka.  All right, all right, all right.  I have to say, I didn't realize how much I enjoyed Paul Anka's work.  Well, he's a real prick to his band is what I'm getting at here.  We got some audio that I guess some lovely engineer.  You got to love the engineers out there.  Oh, yeah.  If there's an engineer taping you.  See, these are all nice songs, right?  Oh, yeah.  They're all sweet and sugary.  Oh, yeah.  So you figure out the guy singing him must be a really nice guy. 
[03:07:00]  Can I point out how awful Jennifer Lopez looks on Ellen right now?  J-Lo looks awful.  She looks...  Do you T-Vo it?  We do.  We T-Vo it.  We catch up on everything.  Yeah, when we get home, then we watch like five episodes in a row.  We have a marathon.  Now, was it surreal to be sitting...  You know, she's still from the block.  I'll say.  I was with you in the dressing room before you came out.  Watching everyone dance before you went on.  Yeah, she's trying to be really white with Ben, and now she's ghetto in it.  She was amazing in such a lot of outfits, tricks. 
[03:07:30]  Let me see.  What looks bad about her, though?  Her hair is horrendous.  Who's got the five head?  She looks like Dio.  You're watching Dio.  Dio.  Look at her.  Holy dave her.  Fucking eat her ass and hum Neon Nights. 
[03:08:00]  All right, let's focus.  Paul Anka is a real prick.  And some studio engineer kind of taped him as he was going off on his band.  Yeah.  No t-shirts on stage.  Do you understand that?  See the shirts that everybody's wearing?  Can everybody put...  Where's the guy at the end?  We saw him won't wear.  He's missing.  Yeah, he won't wear a t-shirt on.  No, no. 
[03:08:30]  No, but the other guy on the end had the t-shirt.  T-shirt!  I'm sorry.  Didn't I say shirts?  Yep.  I thought he was covered.  You thought, you thought, you thought, you thought eight things tonight.  You're on fucking notice, John.  I gave you a list.  That half a list that I gave you was choosing everything on it.  Okay?  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get shirts.  Do you understand?  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest link.  The guys get shirts. 
[03:09:00]  Do you understand that?  This is like football, baseball, like anything else.  The guys get shirts.  That's just the fucking weight it is.  You first start with getting your goddamn list correct.  So there's no confusion.  When I write something down, it gets exactly that.  Now, what are we going to do about these cutoffs?  My weight cutoffs?  I'm kind of waiting for you. 
[03:09:30]  What did we discuss at the last...  Holy crap are these guys nervous.  They're all flustered now.  The cutoffs, the...  What about these shirts?  What about the shirts?  I don't know.  It sounds like Paul Anka wanted some things done,  and everybody just kind of said,  fuck off, Paul Anka,  and now they have to pay the piper.  Now they've got to pay the piper?  Absolutely.  And why does the trumpet player have to sit out here waiting all day, fuckface?  I love this behind-the-scenes stuff, man. 
[03:10:00]  It's so nerve-wracking to listen to these poor guys like,  oh, I'm a schlep-fucking-session player.  Right.  It was making minimum,  because for all the senior citizens out there,  Paul Anka can't do wrong, you know what I mean? 
[03:10:30]  No, of course not.  They think he's just the sweetest, nicest, hometown boy,  makes good type of guy,  and it turns out he's a prick like everybody else.  There you go.  Did he sing,  wait, he's not the one that sang,  Roses are Red, My Love, is he?  No, I think that was Bobby Vinton.  Bobby Vinton, okay.  He sat and watched Bobby Vinton.  Is that correct?  I was going to do that one,  you're going to hold the cord and cut it,  is that right?  Absolutely.  All right, now what are we going to do about my one?  We're not walking around, waiting and waiting, 
[03:11:00]  and you finally give it,  and when was everybody cutting off with you?  I don't know.  Evidently they were watching you,  or they should have been watching me.  But you were doing it.  I did it.  What's it going to be, guys?  Who are you watching?  I'd suggest they watch me, I'll watch you.  But you were the only one to watch.  Absolutely.  Let me ask you this.  A pilot is in a plane, he's landing.  He not only looks at his instrument,  but he looks at the fucking runway to make sure it's there. 
[03:11:30]  What do you look at?  Oh, my God.  He's giving aircraft analogies.  You know who this sounds like, don't you?  Who?  I'll give you one guess.  We've been the band members.  Oh, Mel?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah, this is a meeting with Mel Karmazin.  Oh, my.  There's nothing you can say that is right.  Yeah.  You just have to sit there and take your beating.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting, like, flashbacks in it. 
[03:12:00]  What do you look at?  Who are you watching?  Where were you guys on the end of my way?  Graham, what happened?  I was late because I usually watch you on that.  I told you to go fuck your mother.  If I'm not doing anything, if I'm not doing anything, and he throws, do you remember the last meeting where I said, I'll bow, I'll do, take it, and end it?  Except for I'm not anyone, I'll give, I'm not anyone.  Do you all remember that?  If my arms aren't up, and he's the only one, why wouldn't you take it in there? 
[03:12:30]  What is the confusion on these enemies?  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Do you understand that?  I don't know.  What's it going to be, guys?  Do you want fucking Vinnie Falcone in front?  Do you want me to go and get a conductor that'll sit and ride your asses?  Is that what you want?  Do you want your jobs? 
[03:13:00]  Oh.  You want your jobs?  Oh, man.  Oh.  Wow.  That's rough.  You've got to read that one feedback that Eric Logan wrote in, and he said, after this episode, Paul Anka was not happy.  Wow, man.  Want a conductor to come in here and ride your ass?  As opposed to you riding our ass?  Yeah, sure.  We would welcome the conductor at this point.  This is the point where you've just got to say, Paul, we get it. 
[03:13:30]  Shut your face.  All right.  We screwed up the endings of a couple of songs.  Do you think the old friggin' fogies in the audience even noticed?  Enough or nothing, but Elvis does it better.  Perfectionist.  He does it better my way than you do.  Yeah.  Why are you even trying to do my way?  Exactly.  Where's Joe?  I'll tell you I want the band.  Do you understand that?  I want the fuckin' band, okay?  There is a lot of loose shit going on, and I am telling you, you guys are on thin ice. 
[03:14:00]  All right?  I'm telling you right now.  And when I fuckin' move, I slice like a fuckin' hammer.  You've seen it, and I'll do it again.  When I tell you the band, you better look and make sure everybody's here when you walk  in this room.  I will not put up with this shit.  Do you understand that?  That's just the fuckin' weight it is.  Every one of your fuckin' checks cash with the amount on it.  Do any of your checks mount it?  Do y'all get full value on your money?  I want full value on your fuckin' service. 
[03:14:30]  Do you hear me?  Do you understand that?  You guys have three fuckin' days to get it together.  Oh, man.  I would so walk and go, you know what, you fuckin' prick.  Go fuck yourself.  They're band guys.  They're playing for Paul Anka.  Packed houses.  Yeah, our checks don't bounce, but they're a lot smaller than yours.  Yeah.  Jesus.  What a bastard.  And in the end, does anyone really notice when a band member fucks up?  I mean, come on.  Not in these settings? 
[03:15:00]  Exactly.  No one would notice.  I did it my way.  You're kidding.  What happened?  He blew the whole end of the song.  Who's song is this?  No, the trombone player came in in the right spot.  Where?  Where?  I was just listening to the song.  Oh, God love him. 
[03:15:30]  Give my condolences to the baritone.  What is it?  Who's is?  Who is this?  Who is this?  Who is this?  Senile old broad.  Where?  It makes me laugh every day.  This isn't the right Paul Anka.  Any of them would notice. 
[03:16:00]  Sit there and applaud.  All of you head of your department.  Okay?  The light of the times of your life.  What is that blue doing over there on?  All the way to the middle.  And then you shut it off.  What is that all?  That was a fuck-up.  That was a fuck-up.  I see that again.  You're gone with the rest of them.  Is that clear?  That's just the way it is around here.  You understand that?  That's how fucking crucial this is.  You have nothing to do but watch to see if one special is on and if the film is on. 
[03:16:30]  Correct?  You have nothing else to worry about with those lights.  That whole thing was washing out that film.  You will straighten out this goddamn cut-off, John.  Absolutely.  Do you understand?  You will get it straight.  I'm the only important one on that stage.  You know it.  Oh, wow.  I'm the only important one on that stage and you know it.  Wow.  Good point, Paul. 
[03:17:00]  Good point.  He's the boss.  I like him.  He's a take-charge guy.  A guy missed a light cue or something?  Yeah, there seems to be a light problem, a lighting problem, because they were taping  something and it washed it out, because the lighting was wrong, and then the endings of  the songs aren't going the way he wants.  I have had this very discussion with Keith Robertson and Robert Kelly and other people  that have opened for me.  I am the important one on that stage.  Right.  And you know it. 
[03:17:30]  No one else matters.  That's right.  Do you guys have anything to add to this?  Can you help them out?  Do you guys have anything to add to this for confusion?  Can you give us some intelligent input here?  Where's your problem?  I'm warning you.  I'm the only important one on that stage.  You understand that?  I'm warning you.  Do you want to lose the job? 
[03:18:00]  Do you?  Then put me some fucking knowledge in here.  Tell me what's wrong.  He's the only one with his hands up and he cuts off.  Now give me some intelligent fucking answers.  Who are you watching?  Ain't you watching it, Hooper?  Why have I an idea?  I don't want an idea.  I want an idea.  Oh my God.  Oh boy.  Why would you ever say, well, I have an idea?  Oh boy.  I have an idea.  I haven't heard this, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this idea is not that good. 
[03:18:30]  I have an idea.  Kill Paul Anker.  Yeah.  Sounds like Paul Anker could get these guys whacked if he wanted to.  Go ahead.  Why have I an idea?  I don't want an idea.  I want to know what went wrong.  I don't want to know how to fix it.  I don't know what's going on to me.  I can't even play it again.  I don't want to know how to fix it.  Now I'm definitely taking it from John.  It won't happen again.  Absolutely.  Where's Joe?  Now guys, I'm giving you all one week to get this together. 
[03:19:00]  Okay?  I'm giving you one week to play that music the way it's supposed to be played.  I'm giving everybody one week.  Everybody's got one week to do it right.  Because I'm in my form right now.  If you guys are not going to come up and support me with the enthusiasm I got for it, it ain't  going to work.  I'm the only important one on that stage. 
[03:19:30]  And you are letting me down.  Do you understand that?  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Do you understand that?  And the only satisfaction I'm going to get is to win your fucking asses like the coach  of a ball team or any goddamn business until you get it.  Do you understand that?  Because if you don't feel embarrassed about it, and you have no conscience, you have no  heart, you have no integrity.  Do you understand that?  Then all you do is you take the fucking money and you've got no substance. 
[03:20:00]  Remember that.  People of substance and character care about what the fuck they do when they fix it.  Okay?  And I think you're working with me because I think that's the way you are.  And I don't pull any punches with you guys.  I am telling you that his job is on thin ice.  And you know how fast I move.  I don't care if you're a light man, a production manager, an agent, or a theater owner like  last night.  Do you understand?  I have a new philosophy.  Don't give it to Jesus Christ.  I'm the only important one on that stage.  Don't do it my way. 
[03:20:30]  Then it's the highway.  Oh, my way or the highway.  If you're supposed to be properly with integrity or no one is fucking dispensating to them,  you all fucking can go.  Wow.  I'm the only important one on that stage.  Do you understand that?  Shit, how many fucking times?  This guy is pulling one of those Sinatra things.  He heard about all the cool Sinatra stories, but you know something, Paul?  That was Sinatra.  And now he figures he's got to, you know, keep these guys in line.  Keep them down.  Did he yell at his band, Sinatra? 
[03:21:00]  Yo, I swear to God, I didn't know that.  Sinatra was known for being a real scumbag, a son of a bitch.  To his band?  Yeah, very, like, behind the scenes.  Very overbearing.  Don't you fuck up.  Yeah.  But this is, you know, it's Paul Anka.  That's just the kick that I'm on, the move that I'm on, okay?  I don't care if it's a promoter in the theater.  I don't care if it's CJ Powell.  Is that fair enough?  Fair enough, sir.  I'm warning you.  Is that good enough for all of you? 
[03:21:30]  I'm on that kind of an integrity kick.  For those of you that don't care, step forward.  You finish up the rest of the tour, and then you're gone.  Now, we're all important in the totality.  If you don't care like I care, I don't need you guys to take my money.  Just like that guy last night that fucked up my crew and was short labor.  I lost out $20,000 or $30,000 because my crew got fucked.  Do you understand?  Do you understand where I'm coming from with integrity?  That you guys are better at the same thing. 
[03:22:00]  Because you're all replacing.  Do you all like your jobs?  Do you want your jobs?  Do you?  Always waiting for an answer.  Then you better protect his.  Because if that happens again, he does not have that job.  Do you understand?  And you better make it life.  If you don't do the job, you're gone.  And that goes for everybody.  That's just the fucking way it is.  Because you've got to do good.  And as long as you've got it good, you've got to make it good.  Get it fucking right. 
[03:22:30]  That's just the way it is around here.  Do you understand that?  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Late.  Where's Joe?  And there you go.  Where's Joe?  That's all we got.  What are those pictures that we're supposed to see?  Wow.  Well, who is this?  Aromaine?  I don't know.  From Jersey?  Keith Robertson?  Never heard of him.  He's not letting you get away with that.  Did I say Robertson?  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[03:23:00]  No one knows his name.  It's lucky I know his first name.  Let's go to Scott.  What a prick.  Let's go to Scott in Tennessee.  Scott?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, it sounds like he's trying to get all the negativity out of his life.  Punch it out.  There you go.  Let's go to New Jersey.  Say hi to Tony.  Tony?  How you doing, boss?  Hey.  I want to know why little Jimmy's making fun of Paul Wanker, considering probably him  and his lords sat around listening to him back in the day. 
[03:23:30]  Did you hang out with you and the lords listening?  Sal, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I drummed for the prick.  And let me tell you something.  That was light compared to what he put his guys through over at the Westbury Music Fair.  Oh, you played with him over there?  Oh, my God.  He is unbearable.  And he thinks who the fuck is.  And the worst thing is, he sang off-key and out of tune the whole fucking night.  Maybe that was your fucking fault, Sal.  He's the only important one, Sal.  That's right. 
[03:24:00]  I'm telling you what.  He started with that shit.  Now, we got called out of the union.  And we're a pretty tight union in New York.  You know, nobody can fuck with us too much, you know?  Yeah.  And this guy, Vinny, he was a saxophone player for him.  This guy here, he turned around at the end of the night.  We got our checks.  This guy, Vinny, turned around and looked at me.  He said, you know something?  You're a scumbag with a bad tan.  And we walked out the door.  You showed him.  What year did you play with him?  Oh, I believe that was probably 80, 81, around there.  Yeah.  Did I call him a scumbag? 
[03:24:30]  He's a prick then.  He thinks he's like Mr. Mafia or something, but he doesn't carry no juice.  He's just, you know, he's just an overbearing piece of shit.  Well, the mafia doesn't matter.  Mafia men don't whack you for playing out of key.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  He's just, he's just, he's just terrible to work for.  Nobody in the industry.  When he comes to New York, nobody will play for him.  Nobody.  All right.  Thank you, Sal.  You got it.  Wait, these guys.  Now go home and get your fucking flugel horn. 
[03:25:00]  Wait, these guys don't travel with a band?  I don't know.  He probably has some regulars.  When they do, probably when they tour, they travel with them.  And then when the tour ends, they all just go.  And then the next tour he does, he probably gets a whole bunch of new guys.  They rehearse, learn the new songs, and then they're out again.  What a cock.  I know.  Oh, I think, who is that?  Pat from Monaki had a funny line.  He was waiting for Harry Shearer to ask if they're going to play Stonehenge tonight.  No, we're not going to fucking do Stonehenge. 
[03:25:30]  Spinal Tap.  I never saw it.  Oh, Spinal Tap's great.  Anka should dress his band as the signs of the Zodiac.  Another Spinal Tap reference.  That's funny.  Freddie B. from Philly.  I'm waiting for Anka to say, whatever, dude, whatever.  So I'm going to call Paul Anka a sociopath.  Is that Paul Anka or Joe Cumia, my brother? 
[03:26:00]  And John can go fuck himself from D.C.  I hope this is funnier on the replay.  It's just an interesting tool.  How do you not enjoy that, John, from D.C.?  You know what?  If you're in D.C., turn on Don and Mike later and have a few laughs.  There you go.  Listen to that dog shit.  Just leave the show, John.  Idiot.  People don't get it.  There's a lot of different things we do on this show on a daily basis.  We get serious.  We get funny.  And then sometimes you just listen and go, wow, that's really interesting. 
[03:26:30]  What would you rather have us do?  A wacky alert?  Some drum?  This is funny.  This is hilarious.  The guy's screaming at his band?  You guys want to hear the Bobby Knight or?  Yeah, let's do the Bobby Knight.  Anyone with a mustangasaurus at hotmail.com is their email address.  It has to be a complete tool anyway.  Mustangasaurus?  Mustangasaurus at hotmail.com.  It's got to be an idiot.  Like Mustang with A-S-A-U-R-A?  Yeah, yeah.  Like the, you know, like Brontosaurus.  I don't think he spells it right, though. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  A-saurus with an A.  A-S-A-U-R-A-U-R-A-U-R-A.  A-S-A-U-R-A-U-R-A-U-R-A.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know, anybody with an email address like that has to be a complete tool.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we go to a break with the Bobby Knight rant, and we'll continue. 
[03:27:30]  Now, you may be, but I'm not.  Now, I'm going to fucking guarantee you that if we don't play up there Monday night, you're going to believe the next four fucking days.  Now, I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday.  Now, you better fucking understand that right now.  This is absolute fucking bullshit.  Now, I'll fucking run your ass right into the ground. 
[03:28:00]  I mean, I'll fucking run you.  You'll think last night was a fucking picnic.  I had to sit around for a fucking year with an 8-10 record in this fucking league.  And I mean, you will not put me in that fucking position again, or you will goddamn pay for it like you can't fucking believe.  Now, you better get your head out of your ass.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  So, this morning, I go to make reservations to stay in the city, and I call up the hotel, but their front desk to take reservations is not open this early. 
[03:28:30]  So, she goes, well, I can hand you off to our entire hotel chain reservation service.  I'm like, oh, that's good.  I'll do that.  I'll just make a reservation there.  The connection's really bad.  I'm trying to listen to the guy, and all I'm getting is it's really bad.  Yeah, I can barely hear you. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, well, we've got a connection here, but if you'd like to make a reservation.  Yeah, I'm staying Tuesday.  Two people or one person?  Two people?  Hello?  Hello?  Can't connect on to someone.  Oh, and now the guy's in the office see that I'm getting all pissed off. 
[03:29:30]  I'm starting to get a little pissed.  A little?  Yeah, I know, very pissed.  They call me a psycho.  When it comes to stuff not going your way, all of a sudden you're like, can you hear me?  I know.  I'm like, whoa, hey.  Well, then he goes, like, yeah, king bed, yeah. 
[03:30:00]  Yes, I'll take it.  Whatever.  That's when I said, I'll take it.  Yes, yes.  I went, yes, yes, yes.  I'll take it.  Oh, my God.  And I said, yeah, we're having a bad connection.  I go, what's wrong with your phone?  He goes, he goes, well, are you, are you in the United States?  And that's what I'm, I, I was, yes.  Well, I'm in England. 
[03:30:30]  England?  I make, dude, what am I looking at right now?  I think you're looking at the hotel that you want to stay at.  I'm looking out my window at the hotel I wanted to stay at.  Tomorrow night.  It's right there.  It's right there.  Why do I have to call England to make a reservation?  It's England.  The guy couldn't hear me.  The hotel's right there.  Right there.  Why in God's name does my call have to go thousands of miles to make a reservation that is across the street? 
[03:31:00]  And I can't even hear the guy talking.  It stunned me.  And how I ended the call?  I took my little cell phone and threw it on my desk and went, fuck this.  That was it.  That's how the call ended.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I'll realize your mind And you look for your mind 
[03:31:30]  I'll realize your mind  And you look for your mind  Rich Thompson from Parsippany, New Jersey, Opie.  has an observation.  He said,  How fast would Norton grab his camera 
[03:32:00]  if Jane Fonda the traitor  was in the same building as him?  As we recall,  at the Parker Meridian,  we were eating dinner,  or lunch,  and a woman,  who Jimmy thought was Jane Fonda,  was sitting a couple of tables over.  And he was obsessing.  Is it Jane Fonda?  Is it?  Do you know?  Asking people,  Is that Jane Fonda?  And he had his camera,  and yes, indeed,  he would have snapped a picture.  In a second.  I'd get my picture taken  with Al-Zarkawi if he showed up. 
[03:32:30]  It has nothing to do with me liking the person.  I told you,  I have no integrity.  You'd sit on her lap  on that anti-aircraft gun.  Absolutely.  I'd wear the helmet, too,  and point at her,  smile,  love you on Golden Pond,  LOL,  and then just call her a C-word.  On the way out the door.  Spits a tobacco in her face.  Yeah.  All right.  Anthony,  we forgot to talk about Vonage.  The Broadband Phone Company.  Oh, ah.  What's the deal with them now?  Well, it's phone service 
[03:33:00]  over your broadband line.  That's cable or DSL.  That's right.  It's so easy to use  and install.  Just a simple  one, two, three step process.  Mm-hmm.  Well, this has four steps, though.  But the fourth step  is kind of just a given.  All right.  Step one,  you order Vonage.  Yeah.  That's V-O-N-A-G-E.  Step two,  you receive the hardware, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Step three,  plug into your voice adapter.  Yeah.  Step four,  plug into your home phone.  That's it.  It's all very self-explanatory  when you get it. 
[03:33:30]  Can I say step two  is not really a step  receiving the stuff,  so it actually is three steps.  Yeah, you wouldn't go,  okay, I got it.  Let me check off that step.  Yes.  Step one and two  are kind of the same.  Order, get it.  Counts.  So you're saying  it goes step one, three, four.  No, it's step one,  A and B  and the next one  should be two  and the next one  should be three.  Exactly.  Oh, sure.  They do listen  as four steps  after saying  it's a one, two, three  step process.  It's easy as one, two, three,  so don't wonder  why it doesn't work  when you don't do step four. 
[03:34:00]  Right.  And it's also step five,  pick up, say hello  when ringing.  So it's a 35-step process.  Do not forget  to hang up  after you're done.  Jesus.  Ah.  Well, it sounds  just like a regular phone.  Well, I sure hope so, Anthony.  And plans start as low  as $14.99 a month.  Unlimited calling  anywhere in the United States,  Canada, and Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico.  For just $24.99 a month. 
[03:34:30]  Portability, Opie?  Tell them a little bit  about portability.  Well, you can take hardware  to anywhere that has broadband  and call using your number.  Imagine that.  Say you go over  a little Jimmy Norton's house  and he has a broadband connection  over there.  You can just plug right into it  and make and receive calls  as if it's your phone  and your phone number.  That's a great thing,  but it just shows  that whoever's house you're at  is a cheap fuck  that they're not letting you  use their phone.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I've got to make a call.  All right, did you bring  your software?  Did you bring your phone equipment? 
[03:35:00]  Jesus.  What kind of shizlers  do you hang out with?  Do what I do.  Just go in the bedroom  and make a phone call.  There you go.  That's what I do.  All right.  Vonage comes with all  of the features  other phone companies  charge you for  like voicemail,  call waiting,  caller ID,  and three-way calling.  You have the ability  to keep your home phone number  with Vonage service.  No need to switch  to a new number.  That's a good thing.  If you've got broadband,  you're ready to go.  Call now.  1-800-581-4866.  There are no contracts  and no hassles  so you can begin saving  on your phone bill  right away. 
[03:35:30]  Sign up today.  1-800-581-4866.  1-800-581-4866.  Vonage,  the broadband phone company.  Vonage, actually,  I have a question about this  because I have Verizon  and I'm moving 30 blocks away  and they're telling me  that the building  I'm moving into  I might not have.  It's a 2-1-2 number  but it might not be able  to get so  I don't want to lose  my home number.  So I'm going to have  with Vonage  if I can keep it.  Yes, you can keep  your existing number.  How does that work though?  I don't know. 
[03:36:00]  It's quite amazing.  I would like to know  because I don't want  to lose my home number.  Then I call everybody  and tell them  it's just annoying.  Tell them I changed  the number.  That is a pain in the ass.  I'll just give it out  on the air  and I'll just say  people who don't know me  don't call.  Yeah, don't write it down.  Don't acknowledge this.  That's a good idea.  I guess this is a quickie.  Channel 4 did  100 greatest war films  of all time.  We're just kind of  doing filler now  because we're running  out of show.  I think we're having  a good show though.  That's my thing.  Huh?  I think we're having  a very good show.  I loved today's show.  No, I didn't say  I thought we had  a great show. 
[03:36:30]  I loved and loved.  Me too.  Do I agree with this list?  Let me look.  It's not bad.  Usually they have to like...  The order's a little  screwy on a few of them.  Agreed.  Yeah, alright.  And I'll probably think  of some that are missing.  10th place,  The Bridge on the River Kwai.  That was a good one.  Classic.  Yeah.  Japanese,  The Goddamn Japs.  That's one of those  movies though  they show on Sundays 
[03:37:00]  and it starts at like...  Sometimes they even  start them at 11 a.m.  Just kind of waking up  on a Sunday.  Goes till four  in the afternoon.  Right, exactly.  I love those.  You get rocked in  and you get nothing accomplished.  You think you can watch  a quick movie  over coffee and breakfast.  And it starts out  with huge segments  of movie  and then like  a couple of commercials  and then you're back  to the movie  and by the end  it just comes back  well we've built it  and back to our movie  after these words.  And big long  commercial break.  They come back  oh jolly good 
[03:37:30]  well take some  of this material  we'll be back  with Bridge on the River Kwai.  That was a second  of movie.  Sponsored by Hallmark.  Whatever.  It takes forever  to get to the end  of the movie.  Good point.  Stupid god damn commercials.  Ninth place  Black Hawk Down.  Great movie.  That was a very good movie.  I like that a lot.  Skinny's on the roof.  Skinny's on the roof.  The one thing different  I was reading the book  by the guy  one of the guys  involved in that  and I didn't finish it  because I left it  in a stupid  Saturn dealership.  But remember  there's a scene 
[03:38:00]  when they're getting  captured  and the guy  gets his face  beaten with a rifle butt.  That was actually  an arm.  He said he kept  that out originally  because he didn't  want the family  to know.  Beating him  in the face  with one of his  comrades' arms.  Yeah he said  I think for the family  he kind of kept it out  in the original report  he just didn't want  that known  but that is the reality  and it came out  in the book.  You know it's unfortunate  we pulled out  and ran  from that area.  Mogadishu was it?  Somalia. 
[03:38:30]  Somalia.  And  but the body count  before we left  was just fantastic.  We killed so many  of those savages  on the way out.  Well weren't we  trying to protect them  from a warlord  or something like that  who was starving them?  I mean I don't know  the exact  Yeah well the whole thing  was they were  sending in food  because people there  were starving.  Right.  And the food  was being taken  by these warlords  and sold.  So the people  that needed it  weren't getting  the yeah  they weren't getting  the food. 
[03:39:00]  So Clinton sent  in a bunch of troops  to protect the food lines  to send in the food  and also  to take out  some of these warlords.  That was like  one of the missions  was and the mission  they were on at the time  was to capture  one of these warlords  and bring them in.  And it went horribly wrong.  They were horribly undermanned.  Totally underestimated  the strength  of the savages there.  And got in a world of hurt.  And it was just  a silly thing  I mean a silly thing  a guy fell out  of the helicopter  and they had to go back down  and one took a hit 
[03:39:30]  when they were going back down  to get the guy  who fell out.  Bam.  Got hurt.  Hit the helicopter  that helicopter goes down  they send in more helicopters  to rescue him  that goes down  there's a convoy  that gets lost  they underestimate  how many roadblocks  were put up also.  They had maps  of this area  but sometimes  they would try  to turn down a street  and that street  didn't exist anymore.  It was just all  blocked up.  Horrible.  But I mean  so many of these  savages were killed  as we were pulling out  that doesn't make up 
[03:40:00]  for the dead guys  but it's always nice  to have more of them  dead than you.  Absolutely.  I say.  Let them starve.  Tough shit.  Black Hawk Down.  Good movie too.  Ridley Scott.  Yeah.  Very good director.  All right.  In 8th place  100 greatest war films  Zulu.  I don't think  I ever saw Zulu.  Yeah.  I saw Zulu years ago.  That was pretty good.  Definitely got you thinking  what it would be like  to be these few soldiers  sitting there  in the midst of these  being overrun by Zulus.  Pretty scary.  With spears. 
[03:40:30]  Spears glistening  in the sunlight.  In 7th place  A Bridge Too Far.  I'm not sure  if I recall that one.  Who was in that?  Who was in A Bridge Too Far?  I don't even remember.  Directed by Sir Richard Attenborough.  Mm-hmm.  Who was in that?  Doesn't say?  No.  I forget that one.  6th place  Platoon Anthony.  There you go.  Love the Platoon.  Who doesn't love Platoon?  I would have put Platoon  a little higher on the list.  So would I.  Absolutely.  But the top five  isn't too shabby. 
[03:41:00]  I would have put it  ahead of number five  believe it or not.  Well yeah.  I agree.  Although I preferred  number five.  Yeah.  I had a number five  as a movie.  It's two movies though.  It's such a schizo film.  I still can't get used  to seeing that whole thing  at once.  I was telling Anthony  I called him the other day.  I was so psyched.  We haven't even said  the name of the movie yet.  But this movie  I did that reading last week  and dove his friends  with this guy Tony  who I actually know  and had no idea  Tony used to be an actor.  He's now a writer.  Tony had the second biggest  speaking part in this movie  and was cut out of it. 
[03:41:30]  He had the second biggest  the movie's full metal jacket.  Yes.  Number five.  And this guy behind  Moe Dean had the biggest  speaking part  Captain January  and he got cut out.  But he was telling me  full metal jacket  behind the scenes story  which was unbelievable.  You've got to get him in  because it was just amazing  because we're such freaks  for that.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh.  Cut out of it.  Cut out of it.  But I mean  the number two role.  Not some like  you know  he stinks  and I don't like him  and you happen to  I made it in Spider-Man  with one line  and he didn't make it  in a full metal jacket  he played chess with Kubrick. 
[03:42:00]  It's not like being cut out  of the gynecologist  you know.  Exactly.  It's full metal jacket.  Which we've got  not to you know  demean any of your work.  No no no no  but I mean  the way Voss stays in character  and focuses  when he does a line  I mean  it's like  the fact that he's  kind of looking like  off into space  he doesn't even throw you.  We may have to finish  this list up tomorrow.  I say we just  kind of leave people  wondering what's going to happen  because that's kind of like  you know what  That is the show  it's always a work in progress.  You know what guys  we really shouldn't 
[03:42:30]  leave people wondering  because people are going  to want to know  what are the next four movies  we have four more to go  we got up to five  and we should probably  let them know  because a lot of people  may not be able to tune in  tomorrow and hear the end of this.  There isn't much time  but I think we ought to recap  number ten was  Bridge on the River Clyde  Absolutely.  Number nine was  Black Hawk Down.  Good movie.  Did I tell you  I enjoyed that movie?  Yeah.  The guy fell out  of the helicopter  and that kind of  that screwed everything up.  Yeah.  And Ridley Scott's direction  on this one  was just fantastic.  I enjoy his works. 
[03:43:00]  Excellent.  Excellent point.  Number eight was  Zulu.  As we recall  Michael Caine  in his first starring role  in the movie Zulu  which was from 1964  I believe.  64.  I was born in 68  I obviously never saw that.  Hey I know  what you guys are doing.  What?  I'm trying to recap.  What was number seven?  Because usually they get down  to number five  and you recap the topic.  I'm on to your game.  Number seven  A Bridge Too Far  A Bridge Too Far  which is 1977.  No wait a minute.  I was platoon  I thought was great 
[03:43:30]  although Charlie  Charlie Sheen's narration  was good.  I would say  it wasn't as good  as other narration  in other films.  Really?  I thought he did  that whole thing  kind of  number four  Schindler's List  not the best war movie  though.  Not a good call  at all.  Glory I would have  put up above that  as a war movie.  Yeah.  Schindler's List  was pretty good.  I put in you.  Number three  Can I get to number three  please?  I'm sorry.  One of the best movies ever. 
[03:44:00]  I love number three.  And number three is Anthony?  The Great Escape.  Ow.  Steve McQueen.  Star studded cast  about an escape  from a Nazi POW camp.  That's right.  Number two  Apocalypse Now.  Who can forget that movie?  I'm amazed  that made it that high  and I'm actually happy  that it did.  And the number one  greatest war film  of all time  is  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
