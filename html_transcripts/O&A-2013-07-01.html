<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

This Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts in the absence of Opie and Anthony, was a "worst of 2013 so far" compilation.  The show began with a humorous recounting of Opie's three-year-old son's sugar-fueled rampage, which included destroying a 65-inch TV with a T-ball and taking an unsupervised elevator ride across multiple floors of their 50-story building.

This was followed by a previously aired interview with James Lipton. Lipton discussed his career at *Inside the Actor's Studio*, detailing his interview techniques (avoiding pre-interviews for spontaneity) and sharing anecdotes from his celebrity interviews.  A particularly shocking revelation was Lipton's admission to working as a male escort ("mech") in Paris during the 1950s, contextualizing it within the social norms of the era. He also recounted emotionally charged interviews with Bradley Cooper and Jack Lemmon, notably Lemmon's candid confession of alcoholism.  The conversation touched on transatlantic differences in attitudes toward sex and the impact of the Stanislavski system on American acting.

The show then shifted to a discussion of acting techniques, focusing on the challenges actors face, particularly with hand placement, using Humphrey Bogart as an example.  This transitioned into an extensive analysis of various interviews with Charles Ramsey, the Cleveland man who helped rescue three missing women.  The hosts played several interviews, highlighting inconsistencies in his statements, his colorful language ("bitches," "motherfucker"), and his frequent mention of McDonald's. They speculated about his future, predicting both fame and potential legal trouble, and compared his case to the Jaycee Dugard kidnapping, criticizing law enforcement's shortcomings in both instances.  Ramsey's unfiltered 911 call was played, alongside discussion of the 911 operator's unprofessionalism and Ramsey's possibly evolving story.

The show's engineer, Mars, was then interviewed. He revealed details about his childhood physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his mother, including incidents involving a hot spatula and being trapped under a stereo system.  He detailed ongoing challenges maintaining a relationship with his mother, despite her self-absorbed behavior.  The hosts expressed empathy and support.  Mars further expanded on his abuse, recounting numerous instances of physical assault by his mother, with his father present but uninvolved. He described his mother's bizarre habits, including urinating in bedpans.  A caller, Ken, shared a similar story of parental neglect and substance abuse, emphasizing his decision to cut ties with his parents to prevent repeating the pattern. Mars discussed his adult life, his strained relationship with his mother, and his wife's encouragement to maintain contact.  He also recounted his own childhood mischief and stealing, and incidents of bullying at school.

Mars's discussion of abuse continued, triggered by a conversation about bathroom convenience.  He detailed further instances of abuse (extension cord beatings), the conversation branching into types of corporal punishment and humorous, yet dark, tangents involving hot spatulas.  Troy Kwonk was briefly mentioned. The conversation touched upon Mars's current relationship with his mother, his reluctance to cut ties, and his feelings of unlovability.  Other contributors shared their experiences with parental abuse and discipline.  Mars discussed how his upbringing affected his parenting style.

Moses Gates, an urban explorer and author of "Hidden Cities," joined the show.  He recounted his exploits with Opie, including exploring under the West Side Highway. They discussed the dangers and excitement of urban exploration, and interactions with security and the public.

A later segment focused on Gates' book, "Hidden Cities."  Gates detailed his illegal entry into the Chrysler Building (reaching the 61st floor and sitting on an eagle statue), climbing to its top, exploring the Naglinka River in Moscow (nearly getting arrested), the Paris catacombs, Egyptian pyramids, and New York bridges and subways.  He discussed his methods, risks, and global network of urban explorers.  His arrest in France for climbing Notre Dame was mentioned.  The segment concluded with the hosts and Gates developing a comedic cop show concept featuring "The Goose," based on Gates' experiences, and a promotional announcement for the show's return after a vacation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission.  James Lipton.  A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide.  I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shitface buffoonery.  E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry.  And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers up my ass.  What the fuck happened?  Relive six months of ONA in just one short week.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  Welcome, everybody, to the worst of the year so far. 
[00:00:30]  An Opie and Anthony special.  Opie and Anthony are taking a well-deserved vacation this week.  So in their absence, I am Sam Roberts.  And I am bringing to you the best moments that have happened in 2013 so far.  We'll be doing this all week long.  But today, we'll start this by going over stuff like Mars and his abusive mother.  Talking about Charles Ramsey. 
[00:01:00]  You know, the guy who rescued the girls from Cleveland.  Moses Gates.  Opie City Exploring.  He saw some insane things that he shared with us.  Norton's new cop show.  A whole bunch of stuff.  This all happened this year.  And it's only July.  Anyway, we're going to start this worst of 2013 so far week-long special with Opie's son's adventure.  This is like baby's day out come to life.  Opie, he's got a three-year-old son who decided to go for a walkabout. 
[00:01:30]  He left Opie's apartment.  And you're sitting there saying, it's an apartment building.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well, it caused a very long day for Opie and a very misadventure for his son.  Here it is.  Opie's son's adventure.  Can you say very misadventure?  On the worst of the year so far.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  So then I go home and my kid is starting to feel better. 
[00:02:00]  So he's like, his energy is back.  So he's fucking rocking around the apartment.  He wants to be outside.  And I'm sure it's all good constructive stuff that helps the family that's ill.  Not shit you have to mind 24 hours a day.  There's got to be a worst case scenario when the whole house is sick and the kid is the one that gets better first.  When I'm 100% healthy, it's a pain in the neck to chase him around all day.  Imagine when your bones are achy and you've got a sinus headache and you can't breathe. 
[00:02:30]  And every time you go up an elevator, you can't hear for 15 minutes.  Oh my God.  Because whatever the fuck happens to your ears when you're all clogged up.  That's what happens when you live in Cloud City.  Cloud City, baby.  That's it.  So all of a sudden, I don't know.  Like, the kid's got to run into place.  Because I can't.  I just can't.  And my wife can't.  And somehow he got into the chocolate bars.  What?  So now he's on a sugar high.  A three-year-old on a sugar high in a fucking house where everyone's sick. 
[00:03:00]  Somehow.  Yeah.  Somehow he got into the chocolate bars.  Because I heard some yelling from the other room.  He got into the chocolate bars.  I'm like, all right.  How much could he have had?  I guess he had a lot.  Because then.  Like fucking Beavis.  Yeah.  For the next six hours, he was completely out of his mind.  Oh my God.  Completely.  It's like having a little coke head in the house.  Well, that's right.  I said to you before the show, I don't do it anymore.  I did it a long time ago.  I dabbled a little bit.  But I was looking at him going, that's someone on coke. 
[00:03:30]  He's grinding his teeth.  Just talking nonsense.  He was talking nonsense.  For real.  Like just babbling about weird shit.  Yeah.  And then he went through all his toys within an hour.  Like he would play with something for five seconds.  And just fucking lose interest, run around, grab something else.  Kids' attention span is very short to begin with.  But when they're on the chocolate, forget it.  On the chocolate.  On the chocolate.  It's a drug. 
[00:04:00]  That's a drug.  Absolutely.  For kids, that's a fucking drug.  And a kid not even three yet?  Oh my God.  Yeah.  My kid is now completely wired on the chocolate.  And I just said, I just decide, you know what?  Fucking do whatever you want.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm achy.  My tooth fucking hurts.  So I sit on the couch and I'm like, you know what?  The Islanders and Rangers are on.  I'm going to fucking put that on my 65 inch TV.  What?  Nice.  And that's about the time my kid decided to break out his T-ball set. 
[00:04:30]  Aw.  He's got a little plastic T-ball set.  Aw.  And he's like, watch, Daddy, watch.  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I got my laptop on my knees.  I'm checking my numbers.  We all check our numbers, right?  Yeah.  Check some tweets.  Check some YouTube views.  Check Facebook.  Check the Instagram.  And he's doing pretty well with that T-ball thing.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, we taught him to keep his eye on the ball. 
[00:05:00]  So I have a video, but I just don't want my kids in the public eye.  Yeah.  We told him to keep his eye on the ball.  So what he does is he puts the ball on the T.  Yeah.  And then he leans all the way down and puts his right eye on the ball.  Hello, bull.  Right.  So he's like, ah, that's adorable.  He leans all the way down like this, puts his eye on the ball, and then he's ready to swing.  So he, literal.  He does it every time?  Every time. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Eye on the ball.  Kids just understand literal shit.  Oh, literal kid.  Right.  If you say eye on the ball, he's going to listen to you and go, all right, if that's what you say makes me a better hitter, I'm going to fucking put my eye on the ball.  There you go.  So he's hitting, and I'm like, wow, that's good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm playing with him a little bit, but not really, because I feel like shit.  He's wired.  I'm like, I have officially given up.  And this T-ball is going on in the living room.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Literally.  I hate to use the word literally, but feet away from my five-month-old.  I literally use it all the time.  Five-month-old. 
[00:06:00]  I was going to ask, what's going on with the five-month-old while all this is happening?  It's not good enough that he's just playing T-ball in the living room.  He has decided he needs to do it right next to my five-month-old daughter.  I mean, right next to her.  She's in a little bassinet.  Oh, boy.  A couple of the balls ended up in the bassinet.  Oh, no.  But I'm like, I can't control this kid.  He's on drugs right now, a.k.a.  chocolate.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I don't know what happened, but all of a sudden, I look up to check out the Islanders-Rangers  game, and my TV's, like, black. 
[00:06:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  But I can still hear the game.  So, it was on BET?  What happened?  Sounds like a nightmare.  Tony in Brooklyn saying, fatherhood is a young man's game.  I'm kind of figuring that out.  A young man's game.  Kind of figuring that out.  Yeah.  So, I look up at the 65-inch TV where the nice hockey game was on, and all of a sudden,  there's no picture.  I'm like, fuck.  And this happens from time to time, so I'm fucking doing a few things, trying to figure 
[00:07:00]  it out.  Settings.  Yeah.  Settings.  Can't figure it out.  So, I'm like, fuck it.  So, now I'm listening to the game like it's old-school radio.  Oh, you still had sound coming out.  I throw a 65-inch TV and can't see the fucking picture.  What you could get with a fucking little radio.  Right.  So, at this point, my wife comes home.  She's like, I don't know what he did.  So, I'm like, I go, could you just please, you know, fix the TV?  I just want to watch the game.  Because she kind of knows some workarounds, I guess.  Yeah.  And I just don't.  So, she's working on it, working on it, working on it. 
[00:07:30]  Next thing I know, I'm in the other room at this point, and I hear kind of, not a  scream, but like a, ah, something like that, right?  So, I come running into the living room, and that's when she pointed out that my 65-inch  TV was spidered.  Somewhere in my fucking, ah, my cloud of fuzziness, he fucking smacked the ball, and he missed  a 65-inch TV.  You missed a good line shot up the middle.  I missed a good fucking hit.  I missed a good hit.  He connected. 
[00:08:00]  And fucking spidered my TV.  Minutes high.  Minutes high.  Minutes gone.  So, now I'm like, now my TV.  And the people that, you know, our parents out there, they've told me off and on on Twitter  and shit, have you had a, you know, have you lost any of your shit yet?  I've been really lucky.  It's not like a wiffle ball?  Well, or.  He's got all sorts of balls, all sorts of different sizes, and there is this one yellow.  Oh, no.  Yellow like, ah. 
[00:08:30]  Croquet ball.  It's almost.  Almost.  Oh, shit.  It's hard.  It's a hard yellow ball that's hollow, and it has like a thing inside that kind of, you  know.  Jingle jingles.  Jingle jingley jingley.  Yeah.  I don't even know what the ball was used for, but I guess he put that on there.  Breaking TVs, apparently.  Right.  And it fucking connected.  Oh, shit.  Line drive right to the TV.  Oh, man.  Fuck.  So the TV shot, 65-inch TV, gone.  There's no fix in those.  There isn't, right?  You don't get those fixed.  No. 
[00:09:00]  So I'm just.  At least you could upgrade now to fucking like an 80.  My day's not over yet.  It's still.  It's not over yet.  So at that point.  If this was a daily day.  If I filmed this, I would compete with Hangover.  This would be a good documentary.  Yeah.  And it should be called Fatherhood is for the Young.  Oh, my God.  So then a young man's game.  Your day should be played for sex ed classes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do not have sex.  See what happens to you.  Nah.  And so then my left eye at this point, I'm kind of closing it because of fucking everything 
[00:09:30]  just aches.  I'm like, I got to get out of the house.  You can close your eyes because it's not like you can watch the TV.  Right.  So you can just relax.  You have to imagine.  So I'm going downstairs because we had to fax something.  And we used to have a printer, but that went a while ago when the kid decided he has to  stand on it a lot.  They just are little tornadoes in your house.  Little tiny tornadoes. 
[00:10:00]  We lost that about a year ago.  Wow.  I just never replaced it.  So if I need to send a fax or something, I just go downstairs.  You got that shit.  Yeah.  So my kid goes, I want to go with you, daddy.  I'm like, no, man.  Dad needs to just breathe.  A minute away.  Yeah.  So I locked the door.  And then with my key, I locked the top lock as well because he's getting pretty good leaving  the apartment.  You got to fucking put him in a little solitary.  Yeah.  So I make sure and I do the double lock.  And I hear him like getting all bummed out. 
[00:10:30]  He can't go with daddy.  And I hear him run away, all bummed out.  I'm still ridiculously wired on the chocolate.  Yeah.  So then I go downstairs.  I'm faxing.  I'm socializing a little bit.  Just chilling out.  Spend some time with some adults.  Right.  And all of a sudden, the lady at the desk goes, it's your wife.  But I hear first, what?  That's what the lady downstairs.  That's I hear her side.  She goes, what?  Oh, no.  So I grab it.  It's my wife on the phone calling downstairs.  What's going on?  She goes, I don't like saying his name on the air. 
[00:11:00]  Blank is in the elevators.  Oh, no.  He's in the elevators.  Your kid?  My kid is in the elevators.  Your kid's in the elevator.  So he got, he.  She said she heard the door open because we figured all this out later.  He will go in the hall a little bit, but come back in.  Oh, boy.  But we sort of watch it.  We're not just assuming it's okay.  Oh, boy.  And then she said that she heard the elevator and was like, no. 
[00:11:30]  No fucking way.  Oh, no.  He got it.  So she ran out in the hall immediately, of course.  And wants to see the doors close.  With a almost three-year-old in the elevator by himself.  Holy shit.  How many floors is your building?  50.  50.  So it's a 50-to-1 shot.  And we're way up there.  We're way up.  Oh, man.  We're almost at the top.  He unlocked all the locks with his little hands?  Yeah, because he now pushes, like, whatever he could find to get up higher. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, so he's climbing.  He's a smart.  A lot of people say he's a pretty smart kid for his age.  I don't know.  Yeah, look at this here.  Booger couch saying, your kid's ripping off your fucking internet show.  Yeah, there's an elevator show for you.  Yeah.  So he pushed a box to open up the top lock.  Wow.  Which we've seen him do.  Holy shit.  And it's not an easy lock, man.  It's kind of heavy duty.  So he used some fucking ingenuity there.  Yes.  Pushed it up.  Yes.  Hopped on the bucket.  And I'm downstairs. 
[00:12:30]  And all of a sudden, you know, the wife's like, he's in the elevators.  I'm like, what?  He's in the elevators?  Oh, my God.  So you can see where the elevators are.  And I'm like, all right, where are the elevators?  This is exhausting.  One was on 18, and one was on, I don't know, like 30, let's say.  Uh-huh.  And I'm like, okay.  I go, call security.  And security goes, yeah, no one's in the elevators.  Because they could see.  Oh, man.  So now he got in the elevator on our floor, and now he got off on a floor somewhere in my building. 
[00:13:00]  So now you don't know where he is?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  No.  So I'm like, all right, get me to the 18th floor, and then I'll just, like, I'll run the stairs until I fucking find him.  Right.  You know?  And then, just as I was about to do that, this lady calls down and goes, we have a kid up here on, I think it was like 24, I guess.  24?  I'm like, what?  How'd he get to 24? 
[00:13:30]  I'm in the 40s.  One of those fucking buttons.  I'm in the 40s.  He hit a button, door open, walked out.  I'm in the 40s.  Wow.  He barely knows how to push the buttons, because I don't, I tell him not to.  So his whole thing was, he was trying to follow me down.  So I go up to the 24th floor, and I'm coming out of, like, the service elevator, and I hear down the hall, it's okay, it's okay, daddy's coming, daddy's coming.  Oh, was he losing his fucking mind?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so then I kind of run around the corner to see my kid pretty fucking freaked out and scared, crying. 
[00:14:00]  Was he happy to see you?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then the lady, the lady, I was thinking of Bill Burr, because she had her apartment door open, her husband was kind of peeking out the door, she was in the hallway with my son, and my son obviously needed comforting, but she wouldn't touch him.  Yeah.  Because, you know.  It's the day and age we live in.  Yeah, it's the Bill Burr thing.  You don't fucking even feel that.  Bill Burr has a great bit about that.  You can't touch kids nowadays, at all.  So she's trying to comfort him without really touching him. 
[00:14:30]  In the old days, he would have, like, the father, like the man of the family, would have had the kid, like, in his arm, going, there, there, over here's your daddy.  You know, a little fucking hat on his head.  Yeah, you know, the police scenario.  Yeah, yeah, the ice cream coat and the cop's hat on his head.  Nowadays, like, don't touch him!  Holy shit!  But I saw that go down in person.  She understands the society we live in.  Yeah.  The world we live in, and she's about a foot or two from him, but trying to calm him, like her hands are out and stuff.  She wants to kind of hold him. 
[00:15:00]  Got to block him like a basketball player.  Yeah.  He's got to fucking...  So I grab him, and I'm like, oh, my God, thank you so much.  I'm so sorry you had to deal with this.  She's like, no, it's cool.  I was just trying to keep him calm, because he was really, really upset.  Jesus.  So then, you know, we go back up to the apartment, and, of course, you know, any moms going through this, when the son is now presented back to you, she's going to kind of break down a little bit.  So she got a little emotional there. 
[00:15:30]  Of course.  A little emotional.  A little emotional.  So then we asked the kid what happened, you know.  He goes, I wanted to follow Daddy.  I got in the elevator.  I pushed five buttons.  He pushed five buttons.  He kept saying that.  I pushed five buttons.  I pushed five buttons.  Because that's what you do.  And then I got out, and then I'm going, Mommy, Mommy, help me.  Help me.  Oh, no.  No.  You can only imagine the emotion that would start off.  So the wife must have fucking just lost it at that point. 
[00:16:00]  Mommy, help me.  Help me.  Mommy, help me.  Daddy, Daddy, help me.  Help me.  And he's, like, conveying this story to you guys.  He's close to 20 stories below where I live.  Oh, no.  Saying this.  He was saying, Mom.  See, he doesn't understand the concept of an elevator.  He thinks you go in, you get out, and you're still kind of on the same floor.  It's magic.  Right.  The door opens.  You're magically somewhere else.  But if you're in the elevator, and he thinks, like, I think he thinks there's only one place  to go, which technically it is, because we only use the elevator. 
[00:16:30]  It's called where Daddy is.  Right.  I want to, I push five buttons.  I go to where Daddy is.  Yeah.  You go in the elevator, you push a button, and you're downstairs.  Yeah.  He doesn't understand the concept that you could possibly stop somewhere else.  Where Daddy isn't.  Right.  Because he just thinks, all right, go in the elevator, push any button, and you're right.  That's the where Daddy is button.  The Daddy buttons.  Right.  But no, he was 20 stories below us.  So, wait a minute.  In the middle of our building.  How many buttons did he push?  He said five.  Five buttons.  Okay.  Over and over again, he said five. 
[00:17:00]  Whatever that means to a kid, you need to push five buttons when you're going into an  elevator.  He's like, Jesse, you don't understand.  I did it right.  I pushed five buttons.  Five buttons.  I pushed five buttons.  That's what you do.  I'm not an asshole.  Yeah.  And then this little, like, kind of, still sort of a baby voice going.  Oh, no.  Then, I wish I could imitate my kid better, but basically, yeah.  And then I got out.  And it was like, Mommy, help me.  Mommy, help me.  Oh, my God.  That's the saddest thing.  A mom never wants to hear that.  No.  Daddy, help me. 
[00:17:30]  Help me.  Of course.  She feels like she failed the kid in some way.  If the kid has to say, Mommy, help me, and Mommy's not there, she had no idea.  Right.  I kept yelling, Mommy, Mommy, Daddy, Daddy.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Which makes it even worse.  Terrible.  He's only in a diaper and a t-shirt.  And dressed like Daddy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Basically.  And he brought, for his little adventure, his three favorite toys.  So he's just holding on to his three.  He's on a little tear. 
[00:18:00]  Sure.  He's holding on to his three favorite toys.  Oh, God.  20-plus fucking floors below where we live in a hallway.  Holy fuck.  Grabbing those fucking toys like it's everything.  Oh, man.  I'm like, oh, my God.  In case he's got a barter for food and shelter later.  He's got some fucking money.  Some kid money.  And that's...  Oh, my God.  So then we kind of got everyone calm and ate dinner.  I woke up with this horrendous sinus headache, and here I am. 
[00:18:30]  I think that's it.  Wow.  I'm exhausted.  It was a weird day, man.  We don't have days like this ever.  That's constant, like, having something to do.  I don't like days where you constantly have something to do.  I need some downtime, and I don't fucking even have a little family.  I don't even know what downtime is anymore.  It's magnificent.  I don't know what it is anymore.  Love it.  The downtime just got destroyed because the minute there is downtime...  Let me flip on the T.  Ah, the old TV. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  Continues right now.  Yeah, now, now.  Continuing on.  It's the worst of the year so far with me, Sam Roberts.  Opie and Anthony are on vacation.  So while they're gone, we're about halfway through 2013. 
[00:19:30]  And 2013 has been a year of years.  It's been a wonderful year.  And so much has happened.  And we thought we had to share everything so far with you all this week.  James Lipton was in studio this year.  It was only a few months ago.  He stopped by.  He was talking about his new book.  But more importantly, he talked about being a pimp in Paris.  Now, you probably read about this.  That James Lipton from inside the actor's studio was once a pimp. 
[00:20:00]  That he pimped hoes.  But you didn't hear that it came from the Opie and Anthony show.  That's because several months after this interview happened,  and some other news source, some magazine article or something,  got the same story.  And they went everywhere with it.  And everybody reported on it like it was news.  We had it first.  We just don't have a great PR firm behind us.  However, this is the evidence.  James Lipton tells us the story way before he told anybody else 
[00:20:30]  on the worst of the year so far.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Obviously, we were astounded by the list of people you have interviewed.  It's quite extensive and an amazing array of celebrities.  When did you start interviewing people in this fashion?  19 years ago.  That's it.  In 1994, when the earth was covered in mists, 
[00:21:00]  I had an idea as a member of the actor's studio  that we ought to create a degree-granting program  for the first time in the history of the studio,  which was then 47 years old.  And you know the people that had given us,  James Dean and Paul Newman and Marlon Brando and so forth,  right up through Pacino and through De Niro and Jack Nicholson, etc.  And I suggested at that time that we...  The studio, first of all, was a very private place. 
[00:21:30]  It was a gymnasium.  And nobody was allowed in from the outside.  It was a place where people could go and what?  Make mistakes.  Why?  Because you learn from your mistakes, right?  But you don't want to make them in public once you're famous.  So that's how it worked.  I said, why don't we create a degree-granting program for the first time?  We don't have to let people in.  The studio is still on 44th Street.  It's still a private, cranky place where nobody can get in.  But let's let this method that has been honed all these years out 
[00:22:00]  in an educational environment.  And that was how we started the Actor's Studio Drama School,  which is now at Pace University.  And when we started the Actor's Studio Drama School,  I had people who would...  All of our core courses, by the way,  are taught by life members of the Actor's Studio.  That way we get the continuity that we wanted.  And so we had people who would teach 30 weeks.  People would come in and do six Fridays in a workshop. 
[00:22:30]  But there was one category left that was unfilled.  And that was those people who were members of the studio  or friends of ours or colleagues with whom we've worked  who could only give us one.  One night of their lives.  So I sent a letter out and said,  Will you come and teach our students for one night?  Paul Newman answered.  Dennis Hopper answered.  Sally Field answered.  I got these extraordinary people saying,  Yes, we'll do it.  And that's when I sent word back into the professional community. 
[00:23:00]  I was by now dean of the Actor's Studio Drama School,  which I had created it.  So they said, Well, you'll give it a year.  Start it, you know?  How long had you been at the studio by this time?  Had you been there since the beginning?  Only two years.  I'd been there by then.  I was trained by Stella Adler and Harold Clurman.  And so I got these responses.  And I sent word back into the professional community  from which I had come.  And I said, Look,  these people are liable to say something worth preserving. 
[00:23:30]  And anybody interested,  because that means television cameras.  And Bravo took the existential leap with me.  At that time, Bravo had 20 million people.  That is to say,  and Cablevision.  They were owned by Cablevision.  There were 20 million subscribers.  Today, we are in 94 million homes on Bravo.  We are in 125 countries.  We have a record-breaking 15 Emmy nominations.  And if you had put a gun to my head in 1994 
[00:24:00]  and said,  Predict that or die,  I would have said,  Pull the trigger.  Can I ask,  when you do such an amazing prep for these interviews,  do publicists give you the same thing they give us?  Well, you can't ask about this.  You can't ask.  What are the parameters you allow?  We are about to do our 250th episode.  Wow.  Not one publicist has ever told me  I can or cannot do anything.  Not one.  There is no pre-interview on our show.  We're the only talk show of our kind  that has no pre-interview.  That's why I have to work for two weeks 
[00:24:30]  to do those 300 or 400 cards all by myself.  Wow.  And the result of that has been  that the guest walks in  and has absolutely no idea what's coming next.  That's the rigid rule on our show.  And nobody has ever asked to violate it.  Not once.  I'm amazed by that.  That level of trust they have for you.  It's trust and trust.  Well, they know that we're going to talk about craft.  We're not interested in gossip.  Right.  We're a master's degree program.  Those are master's degree candidates 
[00:25:00]  sitting out there at Pace University.  And so they know that we're not going to get into gossip.  We don't care about it.  We really don't care.  Seriously.  And what do we care about?  We care about the work they've done.  And if I were to ask you or you  or anybody in this room,  look, I'm going to interview you.  And what we'll talk about,  I'm just going to ask you about  those turning points in your life  that made you whoever the hell you are now.  Both as an artist,  in the case of our show,  and as a person.  And you start, 
[00:25:30]  and I've done my research  and I know that there was a turning point.  Somebody died,  therefore they did this.  And so I asked them,  described to me what happened,  and then they tell me what happened.  And in doing so,  what happens?  It's called effective memory  in the Stanislavski system.  What happens is the emotions  that they felt at the time  begin to come back.  And as a result,  we became to my absolute astonishment  the most intimate  and the most emotional show  of our kind.  Who gave you the most emotional interview 
[00:26:00]  that you can think of?  Bradley Cooper.  Yeah?  Look, when I was asked  over and over again,  over the years,  who's the guest you want the most?  I said, look,  I was for 10 years  the dean of the Actors Studio Journalist School.  I was its founding dean.  I'm no longer its dean.  I'm Dean Emeritus.  And I said,  the night that  one of my graduated students  has achieved so much  that he or she walks out on that stage  and sits down in that chair next to me,  is going to be the night  I've waited for  since we started this program. 
[00:26:30]  And Bradley Cooper  graduated in 2000.  We trained him for three years.  And when Bradley walked out  on that stage,  he looked at me  and I looked at him.  We burst into tears  and we had this,  wow,  we couldn't go on  with the show for a bit  until both of us had recovered.  So there is that kind  of emotional attachment  in the show  that again,  doesn't make us better.  I hope it doesn't make us worse,  but it sure as hell  makes us different.  Yeah,  and it's honest.  I mean,  obviously,  not talking about 
[00:27:00]  the gossipy end of it,  just the craft  and just open honesty about it.  I think people feel safe there, too.  It doesn't feel like  they're going to be blindsided  by some TMZ reporter.  No,  because that's,  look,  we're a master's class  in a university.  We don't care about those things.  Our students don't care.  They would be disappointed in me  if I asked a question about  that it had nothing to do  with the reason  that we're all there.  And the result for us, 
[00:27:30]  for our students,  remember,  they come from 100,  we're in 125 countries.  That's not a joke.  We're immense in France,  in Japan,  in Australia,  in the Scandinavian countries,  in Latin America.  The show is just huge.  And the result is  that our students  come to us  from all over the world  and they come to us  for a reason.  And the guests know  that there's a reason.  And therefore,  the guests have a reason  for coming there,  which is to teach them.  And it turned out, 
[00:28:00]  I thought it would be so dull.  I thought it would be so dry.  I thought we wouldn't last a year.  I'm serious.  I thought we wouldn't last a year.  Here we are,  19 years,  the second longest running show  in the history of cable television.  All of these things,  it sounds like I'm bragging.  Maybe I am.  But it's also the truth.  And it's not something  that I had anticipated  or even planned.  It just evolved organically,  the way an acting role  is supposed to evolve.  Yeah.  How did you accept  being thrust into pop culture 
[00:28:30]  like that?  I mean,  the parodies that have  been done about you,  which are hilarious.  It appears that I am  a figure in pop culture.  Sure.  Watch Arrested Development  when it comes back  on the air on Netflix.  I'm back on the show.  The Warden Gentles,  the character that I created  on the original show.  I'm back on the air.  The Will Ferrell,  of course,  we all know about that.  And it's not something 
[00:29:00]  that I can plan,  but it is something that,  to be perfectly frank,  that I treasure.  Yeah.  I mean,  Will's a friend.  He asked me to be in  his movie with him,  which I did.  And this thing has evolved  too over the years,  this relationship.  Do I like it?  People ask me,  do you hate it?  Hate it?  I would crawl on broken glass 
[00:29:30]  to have this kind of thing  happen to me.  It must have been odd,  though,  to be the dean  of a university.  It was all happening at once.  I was one of seven deans  in a university,  which is an academic position,  of course.  And at the same time,  all this madness was happening.  Yeah.  That's an amazing story.  Of all the people  you've talked to,  what was something  that shocked you?  Like,  what's a piece of information  somebody gave you?  The most shocking one,  I think, 
[00:30:00]  well,  brace yourselves.  It's quite a tale.  It's brief.  Jack Lemmon was on.  I'd known Jack Lemmon  when I was a young actor  and came to New York  and he was already  a famous actor.  And Jack was,  you may know,  an absolutely elegant  human being.  And it was near  the end of his life,  just a few months  to the end of his life,  and he was on the show.  And because I'm  dean of the school,  I'm always trying  to make a point  for the actors.  I'm didactic, 
[00:30:30]  which is one of the things  people make fun of me for,  some people dislike me for.  They think it makes me pompous.  But I'm always trying  to teach them something.  And so here I was  working with Jack  and we were talking  about Days of Wine  and Roses.  And I said to him,  you know,  all the famous scenes  in it,  the scene next to the crib  with the child,  the scene in the greenhouse  when you smash it,  trying to find a bottle  that you stowed there,  the scene when you're arrested, 
[00:31:00]  all those huge scenes,  emotional scenes.  But the most moving,  the most thrilling scene  in the movie  is the quietest.  When you stand up  in front of AA  for the first time  and say those historic words.  And then I paused.  I'm always trying  to get my guest,  I tried to get De Niro  to say,  you're talking to me,  wouldn't do it.  I did get Tom Hanks  to say,  life is like a box of chocolate.  And I waited for him 
[00:31:30]  to say it  and he said it.  He said,  my name is,  he couldn't recall it,  and he said,  my name is so and so  and I'm an alcoholic.  And I turned to the students  and I said,  see, look,  no pushing,  no pushing,  no begging for anything.  Just do it.  Just do what the character does  and let the audience  provide the emotion.  See,  no pushing.  I said,  that's acting.  And he said,  no it's not,  I'm an alcoholic. 
[00:32:00]  Oh wow.  Wow.  And there follows  a 15 second pause,  which I kept in the edit  because I edited the show.  And it's right there  and we just stare  at each other.  And I saw  he didn't want  to go any further  and so I went on  to the next question.  But it was the most startling  moment in the history  of the show.  Wow.  And afterward,  his wife said to me  in the green room,  first time,  Jack's ever said  that in public.  Wow.  So the fact that he said  that I guess obviously  meant he was in recovery  and had kept that private.  Wow.  Yeah.  But he had never admitted 
[00:32:30]  to it in public  in his life  until that moment.  Would you call that  a surprise?  Yeah.  Well,  not in this studio,  I wouldn't.  Come on,  I enjoy a couple  of beers myself.  You're an interesting  guy too in that  but you,  like,  how much of this  is folklore,  but back in France  when you were  a younger guy,  you,  you know,  what is this?  Oh God,  are you going there?  We have to ask.  Yeah,  you were,  you were,  you were,  I don't want to say  a pimp per se, 
[00:33:00]  but.  I was a mech,  macro,  which is not,  which is not strictly  speaking a pimp.  A pimp is somebody  who exploits  the women who work  for him  and generally speaking  that relationship,  nowadays it's unthinkable,  unthinkable.  I'm talking about  when I was a youngster,  this is long,  long ago  where it was all  regulated in France  and so forth,  but a pimp  exploits the women  and often treats  them horribly,  we all know that.  But a macro works 
[00:33:30]  for the women.  They employ him.  And I was living in,  I was living in Paris,  I had no,  I couldn't get a,  a work permit,  it was out of the question  in those days.  Were you acting there?  Are you there?  I had gone,  I was,  I had been acting in Greece  in a film  and then I came back  and I didn't want to come back  to the United States  for a while,  I wanted to live in Europe  and I particularly wanted  to live in Paris.  There's an expression  in French called  rite de passage,  rites of passage.  I was going through it 
[00:34:00]  and I wanted to continue  to go through it  and I had met  by chance  because I had gone  as Americans did  in those days  to the Rupi Gala  to see a sex exhibition  which was in those days  was commonplace  in Paris  and in America  didn't exist at all  and afterward  I had had a drink  in the bar  in the bordello  and met the young woman  who had participated  in this  and we became friends.  she was from Cannes  she was a beautiful 
[00:34:30]  young Canoise  and in those days  France was going  through a very hard time  and the men  couldn't get work  and certainly  the women couldn't  and there was no  opprobrium  associated  with  women who went  into what is called  what was called  the milieu  which is that world  and then came out of it  no  names I could name for you  movie stars  and so forth  who were in it  for a time  and there was nothing 
[00:35:00]  there were students  who were in it  who were earning their way  through school  women who were supporting  their husbands  who were going to college  for example  they were  it was an entirely  different world  and completely regulated  medically regulated  and everything  anyway  then when I ran out  of money  she suggested  that I would become  her mech  so that I could stay there  and we could continue  our friendship  and our relationship  and I did  and it was the most  one of the most interesting  years of my life  now you know the whole story  wow  what is one of the  responsibilities of 
[00:35:30]  I would go to the  I would  in the morning  I would appear  at American Express  which is where all  the tourists turned up  especially the American tourists  right next to the  to the Paris Garnier  and to the Paris Opera  and other people  would be there  saying would you like  I conduct tours  would you like to see  Chartres  would you like to see  Notre Dame  the Paris  etc  all these people  these tour guides  I was a tour guide  I would say  you want to see some sex 
[00:36:00]  and these Americans  startled Americans  would say yes  this is really  what they came to Paris  for  in those days  when was this  roughly  1950s  and so you know  France is still  recovering from  the Second World War  and  and the  then  I would have to go  with them  because they were nervous  they were frightened about it  so I would take them there  to the bordello  and my girlfriend  and another woman 
[00:36:30]  or man  or whatever it was  we had arranged  this thing would occur  and  they were  these people were  electrified  and they would ask me  to translate for them  and speak to these people  and tell them  what they wanted to see  and so forth  so it was a very strange  time in my life  but it was  it was literally  the only way  I could remain in France  I couldn't earn a living  any other way  I would gladly have done  something else  now that's probably  a much more fun way  to make a living  did you get involved  interesting  were you a part of  what do you mean by  get involved 
[00:37:00]  well you know  I mean what I would love  to have done  no  she was my girlfriend  for Christ  yeah yeah  I wasn't going to  betray her  even with her  wow  follow me  it's very complicated  you didn't get jealous  no  no  no  well she wasn't  we were  we were friends  we were really friends  more than anything else  right yeah  and  and she had arranged  for this 
[00:37:30]  it had to be arranged for her  they would have found me  floating in the sand  because you couldn't  you couldn't  practice that profession  unless you had been  endorsed  okay  and so  she got me endorsed  wow  what a great story  I've never discussed this  with anybody else before  on radio  sorry  it's quite amazing  part of  of your history  and just part of history  we never knew  that was going on  I never would have  discussed it at all  I did in my memoir  inside and side 
[00:38:00]  it was there  in black and white  for everybody to read  but  Arthur Lawrence  the great playwright  had been there  and  with a whole group  of people  Stella Adder  who was my acting teacher  and they were all there  in Paris  they came for the summer  and I was there  and that was when  I was working  and they asked me to  and I took them all  and arranged one for them  this is a sex exhibition  and  and Arthur wrote about it  in his memoir  oh really  yeah  six years ago  just before I wrote  my memoir 
[00:38:30]  and  he talked about it  and  and  so I felt  he had outed me  did he drop your name  in there  drop my name  I thought maybe  it was an anonymous  type of  no  he called me  he didn't mention  the name  he was the guy  who hosts  the actor's studio  no I wasn't that then  he called me  the sex guide  and  and so  once that had been done  I had  there was nothing  I could do about it  except 
[00:39:00]  my memoir  to put it on record  truthfully  once and for all  when  Julia Roberts  was on my show  years ago  and  Julia had played  of course  a prostitute  famously  and  I said  did we interview  prostitutes  and so what  she said  yes  and we got into that  and then I began  to talk about  I said  well when I was in France  I  and so forth  and then  now I realized  I had trapped myself  that was long  before I ever discussed it  and I didn't want to go  any further with it  and Julia  she started laughing  she couldn't stop laughing  and it's one of the most 
[00:39:30]  famous moments on the show  where I was just  sort of fumbling around  and I didn't know  what to say  or how to get out of it  and Julia could not  stop laughing  tried to drink her water  and her teeth  were rattling on the glass  she let you off the hook  or she probably could have  pursued it  oh she didn't  but I didn't  confess anything  right right  it wasn't until  Arthur Lawrence  wrote about it  as an experience  of his life  that I decided  I had better set  the record straight  such as it is  it's an interesting story  and you know what  it's so  it's in a time in history  where it doesn't seem  as seedy 
[00:40:00]  as anything like that  now  listen  the women who were  in the media  in those days  were  some of them  were very  very elegant  and  it was  and as I say  they were examined  weekly by a doctor  it was  completely regulated  some of the bordellos  of that time  were among the most famous  in the history  of the world  these women  were like geishas  and they were so  royally treated  and as I said  women moved in and out  they needed the money 
[00:40:30]  they were desperate  and so they would do this  for a while  and then would come out of it  people would know  that they were in it  there's a very famous  very very famous  French movie star  who was in and out  of that milieu  I won't say who it was  and that's not my right  but I know she was  and when they came  out of it  there was no  opprobrium whatsoever  people never even  gave it a thought  the French have always been  look  we're the United States  of America  we're uptight  what tradition do we have  that the French do not have  the Puritan tradition 
[00:41:00]  there is a Puritan tradition  in America  which we inherited  from England  but the Catholic countries  of Europe  France  and Italy  and so forth  do not have a Puritan tradition  as a result  they look  neither does Asia  neither does Japan  for example  and so in those countries  you don't find  the same kind of nervousness  or obsession  with sex  they're much less  actually  much less obsessed  less uptight  too  just less uptight  in general  one of the problems  with the Catholic Church  today is that  it has become  absolutely riveted 
[00:41:30]  on the subject of sex  and I'm not criticizing them  that's their right  but it is a fact  and  they are  they are more sophisticated  perhaps about it  and certainly more casual  about it  they don't see it  as a  as  every  encounter  as a life-changing event  sure  I'm not saying  that's right or wrong  but it's  different from our own tradition  we are more  uptight  and it has to do 
[00:42:00]  with our Puritan tradition  yeah absolutely  I think it takes away  from some  things that could be  you know  art  I think it takes away  from art  in this country  look at Japanese art  the greatest  Japanese artist  the Rembrandts  and the  Da Vinci's  of Japan  all  painted  pornography  pure  pure  graphic  pornography  my wife  is half Japanese  and half Irish  and she studied art  with a great Japanese artist  he was a national treasurer  they declare them  national treasurers 
[00:42:30]  in Japan  and he gave her  as a gift once  this  it hangs in our house  this painting  by a  master  one of the  18th century masters  of Japanese painting  and it is a  pure  pornographic  picture  and it has a  place in your home  right there  prominently displayed  pride of place  you see  wonderful  love it  why not  absolutely  why not  absolutely  did you study with 
[00:43:00]  did Brando study  with Stella Adler  Brando studied  with Stella Adler  De Niro studied  with Stella Adler  Harvey Keitel  studied with Stella Adler  I studied with her  for two and a half years  she taught for two years  and actually I was  she asked me to stay  for another six months  which I did  and worked with her  she was the greatest  single  academic influence  on my life  did you  so you knew Brando  yes I knew Brando  when he was  when I first came to  New York  he was already  you know  a star  but he  I didn't know him  quite well 
[00:43:30]  I'm always fascinated  with people who got  to know him  because he seems  like one of these guys  that was rather difficult  to get to know  at the end of his life  I was always trying  to get him to be  inside the actor's studio  by then he was reclusive  and he would sit up  in his home  and he would  and he would  make phone calls  he would call me  and we would  talk for 45 minutes  but he would  never appear  on the show  by then he would  not come out  of his house  and he was  very  very  very bizarre  he'd speak to me 
[00:44:00]  in Spanish  and I said  I don't speak  Spanish  and then he would  stop  but  we used to talk  for a long time  and I said  why don't we say  this on the air  for God's sake  and nobody  wouldn't do it  so he's one  that got away  but by then  it wouldn't have  been very valuable  anyway  because he had  spit the bit  and he was  no longer  interested in acting  and he contemned it  and he hated himself  as we all know  it ended poorly 
[00:44:30]  but when I first saw him  when I first came  to New York  I saw him in Streetcar  and he was  the greatest actor  I ever saw  did he really  dislike guys  like Rod Steiger  there's this famous  story about  when they were  doing that  I could have  been a contender  Charlie  that he wouldn't  even do  Rod's close-ups  with him  that he just  he hated his acting  is that the truth  I have no idea  I don't know  I don't know  that he did  but certainly  that scene  is justly famous  he did everything 
[00:45:00]  wrong in it  he did everything  unpredictable  instead of being  angry at his brother  instead of being  frightened  of his brother  the two things  that you would  think  that any actor  would have chosen  made those choices  in the scene  his brother was  destroying him  at that moment  what was he instead  he was heartbroken  he was heartbroken  that his brother  would do  it was the most  amazing choice 
[00:45:30]  and only a Brando  could have made it  I think that  nothing  nothing  impresses me  an actor  more than risk  if an actor  takes chances  and is utterly  unpredictable  then I know  I'm in the presence  of a great actor  and  there's one more  ingredient  that's necessary  if the actor  first  you are  absolutely  startled  by his choices 
[00:46:00]  or her choices  and in the end  you realize  they were what  inevitable  that's what makes  a great  great actor  and that's why  Brando  to my taste  is the greatest  of his time  and we have some  great ones going now  who do you think  is unpredictable now  completely  who shocked you  Philip Seymour Hoffman  there you go  he is good  yeah that's a good one  yeah  did Brando ever  talk about  acting  and the actual  craft of acting  in public  in any way 
[00:46:30]  yeah  he decided  after I started  inside the actor's studio  I think he was  inspired by  because he's a member  of the actor's studio  he was so aware  of it  he decided  he was going to  teach a class  in Los Angeles  advertisements  went out  people walked  and they rushed  to be taught  by Marlon Brando  and they arrived  at the appointed  place  and he waited  for the door  to open  for him to come in  he walked in  in a dress  as I recall  it lasted 
[00:47:00]  I think  about 24 hours  by then  he was 2  he hated acting  he thought  that acting  was not  a worthy profession  and you know why  because he was  a genius  geniuses  make one  mistake  consistently  they think  that whatever  they do  is easy  why  because it's  easy for them  and they  didn't have  to learn it  because it  came from  instinctively  and as a result 
[00:47:30]  they think  it's easy  and it's easy  for them  to become  contemptuous  of it  because look  I'm doing  this thing  what's so special  about what I'm doing  why should anybody  make a fuss  and eventually  people like Brando  become contemptuous  of it  for example  Ted Williams  had to teach himself  every moment  of swinging a bat  he could teach you  how to swing a bat  because he had  to teach himself  he wasn't  a genius  what he was  was a great  great  great  great student  and he taught  himself how to do it  Willie Mays 
[00:48:00]  never gave it  a minute's thought  in his life  he was a genius  it just happened  he would get up there  he'd swing the bat  and he'd hit a home run  there are those  two kinds of  those two approaches  to a craft  and Marlon  was absolutely  a genius  he just was able  to do it  now he was  well trained  by Stella Adler  he had a thorough  training from her  when you put together  technique  with talent  you can't teach talent  talent  tell us what you  bring to the table  and  I wonder what that's like 
[00:48:30]  yeah exactly  I said I wonder  what that's like  I'm sure you know  but  you put together  talent and technique  and then out comes  some brand  you know  I can't even watch  movies like  Miracle on 34th Street  was on recently  I just can't watch  things from that era  anymore  because again  like watching guys  like Brando  and like  Hoppin  I can't watch  the old school  acting anymore  it just seems so  disconnected to anything  because it was  English acting  until the  Stanislawsky system  took hold in America 
[00:49:00]  through the group theater  on which came  Stella Adler  and Lee Strasberg  and all the teachers  whom I have studied with  until then  it was a pale imitation  of English theater  they had a kind of  false English accent  everything had to look good  and they practiced  in front of a mirror  until they had themselves  just the way they wanted  none of it was organic  none of it was felt  none of it was emotional  none of it was real  it was all  a system of  posing  of 
[00:49:30]  it was rhetorical  it was  it was  essentially false  very much like  old stage acting  that's what I'm talking about  it was theater acting  they took it to film  but then when the group  when  the Moscow Art Theater  on Stanislavsky  came here in the 1920s  there was a revolution  and that was when  Strasberg  and Stella Adler  and Harold Klerman  and Cheryl Crawford  they saw what was happening  on that stage  and they knew that the door 
[00:50:00]  had opened  it would never close again  and then they founded  the group theater  out of that came  the plays of Odette  out of that came  all of our greatest actors  and today  it is  it's transcendent  in the world  there is no actor  who is not touched  by it in one way  or another  and in America  we've had some  very very very  great teachers  the greatest whom  I thought was  Stella Adler  and she did  teach Brando  and once again  there with me  I brought a minimal  talent to it  so I was okay  but he brought  this great talent  put it together  with her technique 
[00:50:30]  and out came  a very great actor  this footage  oh the same  yeah unfortunately  I should have  one more question  did they say  this footage  I'm not a fan  of Shakespeare  I can't enjoy it  but I watched  Brando doing like  you know  you know  Mark Anthony  I think he was doing  and I couldn't  take my eyes off it  because it was like  this is the only guy  I've ever seen  do it  neither could the  English actors  I remember once  one of the English  actors on my show  was it Tony Hopkins  or John Hurt  I've forgotten  which one it was 
[00:51:00]  Ian McKellen  they said to me  look at the Julius Caesar  you'll see  what Brando was doing  was  here we all came  with this classical  training  with the perfect  body  the perfect voice  the perfect  behavior  and Brando came  on that screen  and we were all  of us  in the shadow  and  he was  he was able  to bring to it  the kind of  of  of  of  deeply  felt 
[00:51:30]  emotions  of American  training  and acting  when applied  to Shakespeare  who was  a great  writer  of emotion  a great writer  of feeling  a great writer  of character  and when you put  those two together  then you've got  a performance  like Brando's  but I mean  others do it  very well  I think Tony Hopkins  is a perfect  combination  when he was  on my show  he told me  that while he was  studying at the  Royal Academy  in London  learning the 
[00:52:00]  kind of acting  that we all  associate with  with Shakespeare  and with English  tradition  he was sneaking  off and studying  Stanislavski  with an actor  acting teacher  in London  and putting the  two of them  together  and when you put  that exterior  technique  which is external  in which  certain aspects  of the character  are acquired  externally  together  with an  internal technique  that digs deep  into your own  soul  and makes you  recreate  whatever it was 
[00:52:30]  that Shakespeare  wrote and said  organically  from your own  life experience  and from your own  deepest  deepest  the marrow  of your bones  then you get  the kind of  exquisite acting  that all of us  can react to  and never forget  yeah  wow  so rare to see  they're telling us  what they did  oh yeah  yeah  you're  you're  you're  very busy  today  apparently  James is promoting  of course  inside the  actor's studio 
[00:53:00]  it's an amazing  show  you get more  out of actors  you watch  Tina Fey  which is tomorrow  night  on Bravo  and you  we talked about  what  improvisation  because she came  from Second City  she gives a lesson  in improvisation  that is incomparable  and guess what  we then improvised  and I was allowed  by her  to interview  Sarah Palin  oh  she does  watch it  yep  she does  Sarah Palin  that we do  about  eight minutes 
[00:53:30]  together  of Sarah Palin  of her Sarah Palin  and it is  absolutely  extraordinary  and it's  improvisation  oh totally  improvising  we're both  improvising  you're an amazing  interviewer  and a great guest  and you know  what you get out of  actors is amazing  no one gets that  stuff out of them  thank you  fantastic  thanks for coming in  and I think a great  interviewer gets things  out of people  like you know  some people got James  to talk about things  that he hasn't talked  about  right  Jimmy  my wife  if she hears this 
[00:54:00]  she's going to kill me  meanwhile you should have  maybe gotten an acting  lesson from him  instead of acting  yeah I really should have  I do things that are  unpredictable too  I forget the lines  and when I do remember  I suck  Jimmy has a problem  he doesn't know  what to do with his hands  to make them look natural  as he's acting  yes  he's either by there  or fault  hands are the problem  look at  when you watch  Humphrey Bogart  Bogart never figured out  what to do with his hands  he usually tucks them  into the belt of his pants  really Bogart  couldn't even figure it out  watch him  he was never comfortable  with his hands 
[00:54:30]  I find that  like what I'll do  is I'll just talk  I'll just put them  over my head  out of frame  people just forget  that they exist  that's why in the K-mutiny  he was doing that  with the Marvels  but he just brought those  one day  it wasn't even part  of the script  the worst is yet to come  this is ONA's worst  of 2013  so far  on the Opie and Anthony  channel  Opie and Anthony's worst  of 2013  so far  Opie and Anthony  I'm here on vacation 
[00:55:00]  I'm sorry  I know that you may not be  I'm not either  my name's Sam Roberts  and I am bringing to you  Opie and Anthony's worst  of 2000  2013  so far  going over  just a few  of the amazing things  that have happened  this year  all week long  right now  I want to talk about  Charles Ramsey  there's a big news story  that happened this year  in Cleveland, Ohio  where a man  found  three missing girls 
[00:55:30]  that have been missing  for quite some time  he was a man  who just wanted a Big Mac  and instead  became a hero  it's Charles Ramsey  we report on him  you decide  it's the worst  of 2013  so far  ONA's worst  of 2013  so far  Charles Ramsey  as Travis put it  during the break  is the gift  that keeps on giving  he uh  he's the guy  that saved  the broad up  there in Cleveland  what's her name again  Amanda Burry  right 
[00:56:00]  Amanda Burry  was yelling and screaming  she had a hand  like sticking out  of the house  I guess  she's the daughter  of Blue and Dingle  and Charles Ramsey  hears the commotion  and helps her get out  of that fucking  house of horrors  and uh  and now they can't  stop fucking interviewing  him because they know  he's gold  we have to just find  every interview  Charles Ramsey  has done  we found another one  with a black reporter  that we're about to play  is there a remix yet  are there 20 remixes  out there yet  this is from Fox  Fox  Fox 8 
[00:56:30]  is it good  yeah I mean  I listened to the first  you asked me  to preview it  it's two and a half  minutes long  I listened to the first  30 seconds  and I stopped  and I said  this is good  oh  oh okay  what channel  was this on  this is on Fox  in Cleveland  so Fox  local Fox  Fox 8  what was Fox  hungry  wow  we all fell  for that one  here's Charles Ramsey  another interview  yeah this is Charles Ramsey  correct  yes sir  you live next door  to the home

[00:57:30]  my name is Amanda  please  get me out of this house  so I'm thinking  yeah whatever  so I helped her  get out the house  I ain't thinking  that you really  that girl that's missing  you've been gone  for so long  you know  you think you lying  and she called the police  and they came  and they took  a fingerprint sample  of her blood sample  and it came back  it was her  and then she said  it was two more  girls up in the house  now I don't know this  I just helped her move out  you're correct  I helped her move out

[00:58:30]  two more bitches in the house  bitches  up in the motherfucker  it came back  it was her  and then she said  it was two more  girls in the house  now I don't know this  I just helped her move out  you're correct  it was Gina DeJesus  was the other  and then a woman  named Michelle Knight  so you've been living  next door to that house  like you were on the  he doesn't give a fuck  and Michelle Knight  he's like  whatever  whatever  I don't know that nigga  I don't know  Charles Ramsey 
[00:59:00]  fucking rule  Buzz Ramsey  Buzz Ramsey  best guy ever  to get involved  in this situation  you're correct  Gina DeJesus  was the other  and then a woman  named Michelle Knight  so you've been living  next door to that house  had you known  there were any people  no  because I'd have pulled  this heroic stuff  last year  I'd have pulled  this heroic shit  he was there to go  I'd have pulled  this heroic shit  so far he wants to say  two bitches  bitches  and shit 
[00:59:30]  and shit  he absolutely  was going to say shit  I'd have pulled  this heroic shit  years ago  motherfucker  door to that house  had you known  there were any people  no  because I'd have pulled  this heroic stuff  last year  with my goons  with my goons  thank you for restraining  yourself  thank you for  restraining yourself  so you realize  who it was  though  once she said her name  you recognized the name  yeah  and then I walked  down the street  in the last interview  he said he had no idea 
[01:00:00]  he didn't recognize the name  this guy's story  will change  he'll be more the hero  and he'll be arrested  for something  I busted in there  motherfucker  I put my guns out  I sensed something  I sensed something  because I seen  he wasn't right  this guy  yeah  he just lied  from the interview  to interview  I'm black's  fucking super fly  this guy is the best  Anthony  and I say Anthony  me and Anthony  talked about this last year  but he told me  I was paranoid  because I just moved 
[01:00:30]  on the street  and I put him  something  oh my god  now he's saying  he knew something  was up next door  oh  this guy is just  fucking gonna build it  I love him  he's gonna be a superhero  by Friday  oh man  I said Anthony  I put him on camp  my spidey senses  and then I walked  down the street  and I told my  neighbor  Anthony  and I say Anthony  me and Anthony  talked about this  last year  but he told me  I was paranoid  because I just  moved on the street  and I told him  something wrong  with that house  he told me  just leave it alone  pause  what the fuck 
[01:01:00]  he didn't say any of this  we gotta put the interviews  together  in the one interview  did you know who it was  nah  yeah I knew who it was  and then  I would look at him  you wouldn't think  anything  why were you having  barbecue with him  having barbecue  he was tinkering  with his car  you never know  he was just  normal guy  I said  I knew something  was up last year  there is a fire  oh this guy  there is a fire  I got a feeling  he rules  alright we got those two  we gotta put back to back  yeah  those two  did you know the person  that lived there  yeah we all know him 
[01:01:30]  he a good dude  don't say his name  no  that was a good dude  you know him  yeah  but you thought he lived  there by himself  yes  yes  that's what I'm saying  to hear some noises  coming next door  don't make no sense  cause I know you lived  there by yourself  police took him  into custody  they said  this is what I heard  they caught him  at McDonald's  again  cause what I did  was gave him  I gave them  the description  of the car  that he was in  he drives a blue 
[01:02:00]  Mazda Miata  he gave them  I think  Peggy Sinkovich  just confirmed  that as well  earlier  can you hear me  I gave him  the description  of the car  they never would've  caught that nigga  for my ass  motherfucker  oh my god  this guy's gold  is there any more  interviews with him  two so far  we should get him  on the phone  oh he is great  let's get Charles  Ramsey on the phone  oh he is gonna  oh he's gonna be  all over the place  with this  yeah  changing his little 
[01:02:30]  stories  yeah  Eric in Michigan  he sounds like  the husband of the  I don't got time  for that  yeah  yeah  we've been saying  that all morning  her daughter  that appears  to have been  created by a  sexual assault  or rape  and this man  Charles Ramsey  walking by  didn't turn his head  and say  I don't want to  get involved  he jumps up  on the porch  he breaks down  the door  and gets her out  gets her to 911  there's two heroes  and these women  are alive 
[01:03:00]  because of Charles Ramsey  it's fantastic  John I remember  with the Dugards  in retrospect  there were people  who said  they were girls  kept in the  backyard  and the neighbors  no one ever  stepped forward  the cops  checked it out  but they weren't  able to find  anything  meanwhile  there were girls  inside there  kept for years  what are your  early indications  and investigations  showing  were there people  who were suspicious  all about this house  well let's talk  about J.C. Dugard  for a minute  he you know  neighbors made  complaints 
[01:03:30]  and parole  and probation  officers and sheriffs  went into that house  and Philip Garrido  who was a level  three sex offender  who had been  convicted of  kidnapping a girl  and beating her  severely  and keeping her  in a storage unit  that he was  actually arrested  and went to jail  for a month  for parole violation  while his crazy  mother  I mean sorry  his crazy wife  kept J.C.  in the backyard  now if I was the  cop that came to  arrest him for violation  I would have searched  the whole house  went out in the 
[01:04:00]  backyard etc  so I think  law enforcement  can learn something  from this  to take these calls  very very serious  God can you imagine  they were that close  and they didn't find it  that's the Dugard case  where they were  living in the backyard  in that structure  or whatever  and he had a parole  violation  so they sent him  to jail  and the fucking  wife  watched the captive  didn't set her free  or nothing  and the fact that  he kidnapped a girl  and beat her  and then was on parole  and they were so close 
[01:04:30]  to finding what was  going on in that  residence  but they didn't  check the whole place  from top to bottom  wow  can you imagine  being those people  knowing that the  cops are right outside  and just waiting  going alright  it's a matter of time  they're going to get  to where I'm at  and they never do  yeah  fuck  jeez  I have some  Charles Ramsey  comparisons  oh good  yeah  let's do  Charles Ramsey  comparisons  also we're trying  to call the guy  but his voicemail  box is full  I bet  yeah I would assume  but we got his  actual number  that's kind of cool  yeah  alright so first 
[01:05:00]  we're going to listen  to his first interview  that we listened to  this morning  just a part of it  yeah just a part of it  and then we're going  to listen to  the interview  that we just played  on Fox  okay  see if there's any  discrepancies  yeah  that's my idea  of course  and this is Jim Norton's idea  this is Jim Norton's idea  right  he comes out  with a little girl  and she says  call 911  my name was Amanda Berry  now did you know  who that was  when she said that  when she told me  it didn't register  until I got to call 
[01:05:30]  the 911  and I'm like  I'm calling the 911  for Amanda Berry  I thought this girl  was dead  okay  and then he said  this on Fox  so I'm thinking  whatever  so I helped her  get out the house  I ain't thinking  that you really  that girl that's missing  you've been gone  for so long  you know  you think you lying  and she called the police  and they came  and they took  a fingerprint sample  of her blood sample  and it came back  it was her  so first time  wait they cut the part off there  no  first time he says  I didn't think about it 
[01:06:00]  until I called 911  second time he says  when I'm getting her  out of the house  I'm thinking  no you're not  this person  but doesn't the guy say  did you recognize the name  in the second interview  yeah yeah that's true  and then she said  it was two more  girls up in the house  now I don't know this  I just helped her move out  you're correct  it was Gina DeJesus  and then a woman  named Michelle Knight  so you've been living  next door to that house  had you known  there were any people  no  because I don't pull  this heroic stuff  last year  to my groom  yeah there's a part 
[01:06:30]  of that interview  where he asked him  did you recognize the name  oh you left off  the last part  of the second interview  so you realize who it was  so once she said her name  you recognize the name  yeah  yeah no doubt  alright now  okay  we're going to see  if he had any suspicions  that something  was was a lot  in this other house  first interview  every day  I mean every day  how long have you lived here  I've been here a year  okay  you should come up 
[01:07:00]  I barbecue with this dude  we eat ribs  and what not  and listen to salsa music  you should come up  and you had no indication  that there was anything  bro not a clue  that that girl  was in that house  or anybody  okay  and then he said  this on fire  street  and I told my  my neighbor  Anthony  and I say Anthony  me and Anthony  talked about this last year  but he told me  I was paranoid  because I just moved on the street  and I told him  something's wrong with that house  this motherfucker 
[01:07:30]  Charles Ramsey  would make a horrible witness  I told him  yeah  there's something wrong  with this house  5 52 p.m. 34  Eric says  I haven't listened to this  you just sent it to me  Eric says that this is  Charles Ramsey's 911 call  really  yeah  he called 911 as well  so  alright  4 seconds  May  62013  Cleveland 911 police  ambulance to fire  yeah  hey bro  I'm at 2207  3more  West 25th  hey check this out  I just came from  McDonald's right

[01:13:30]  stop eating  what the hell was that  so when I got up  I saw this  my neighbor across the street  he run across the street  and I'm like  I'm thinking  where are you going  because ain't nobody  next door  because I just saw Ariel leave  and I know ain't nobody over there  heard that girl scream  and saw him run across the street  and I went outside  and wondered what he was doing  and  a man would say  I'm stuck in here  help give me out  so he  either don't know  English that well  or panic  but he just looked at me 
[01:14:00]  and was like  he's a girl  and that's all he did  so here I come  with my  you know  half eating Big Mac  and she's like  I've been trapped in here  and he won't let me out  it's me and my baby  and I say  well you ain't gotta talk no more  come on  and I'm trying to get the door open  they can't  I used some of the grease  from the french fries  to lubricate the lock  that's what I did  and then I put a miss nugget  in the corner  and Jimmy the door open  yeah yeah yeah  what happened to the Big Mac

[01:24:00]  if we had known that  man I'd be facing  triple life  wow  I'm glad it turned out this way  nice  triple life  let's go on it Anderson  yeah  wow  he is cool  triple life  with my double patties  I'm having trouble  if I only had a Big Mac bun  I could rest my head on  because they're so big  and  fluffy  he also was in studio 
[01:24:30]  at a Cleveland TV station  you want to try it  it wasn't  it wasn't as good  as the Anderson Cooper  but  you can give it a shot  see where it goes  I have a  more more more  but the biggest  most mysterious  question  in this whole  motherfucker  whatever happened  to the McDLT  that shit was good  there was the cold  lettuce and tomato  on one side  and the hot  patty on the other  motherfucker  but they done  discontinued  that nigga  I don't know  what the fuck  and I checked 
[01:25:00]  under her shirt  to see if she had  any broken McRibs  that's the only thing  he wants  is to bring that back  of course  that's all he has  bring that back  I love the McDLT  bring back the McDLT  and we're square  the cold side  and the warm side  the lettuce  never wilted  cause they didn't  put the shit  on the meat  till you's ready  to eat up  the motherfucker  this whole problem  could've been avoided  if they just  didn't discontinue  the motherfucking 
[01:25:30]  McDLT  the Cleveland  TV program  with the polished  anchors in studio  and he had a nice  brand new lid on  he brought his  homies with him  and we'll give this  a shot  he's got his crew  I opened the door  naturally as you can  see on the news  and it wouldn't come  it wouldn't bro  he had a lock  on there  and you couldn't  open it  and the police  had to  when they got there  they finally  got in a jar  and Amanda says  it's two more 
[01:26:00]  girls up there  and I looked at her  and I looked at the cop  that was in the middle  of the street  and he said  it's what  and she said  I'm not the only one  and they went up there  in about  I don't know  15-20 seconds  they were coming out  with Gina  and that other girl  and I said  oh my god  Charles you've done  so much  and we are all grateful  for the fact  that you were there  and that you were able  to help them  as you go through this  a lot of people  were wondering 
[01:26:30]  how the community  didn't know  were the windows  boarded up  had you not heard  anything in that house  all I would hear  was salsa music  that's all we  he played  naturally  naturally  naturally  you see  we're a racist  everyone  but we all are racist  you know  all we heard  was salsa music  naturally  naturally  naturally  because those people  played that music  yeah you know  that's as common  as seeing a newborn  with pierceers  in this neighborhood  motherfucker 
[01:27:00]  but of course  naturally  that's funny  oh shit  we all have  oh you all have  our shit  naturally  we get to see  all the races  all jumpity jumpity  I couldn't see  behind a fuzzy dice  as you know  of course though  naturally  it was Cinco de Mayo  naturally  yeah  of course  yeah we didn't even  think twice about a bunch  of living in the same house  you can understand 
[01:27:30]  of course  of course  anything in that house  all I would hear  was salsa music  that's how we  he played  naturally  one day  I was playing my music  rap music  naturally  he came  to my house  and told me  turn my music down  because I'm disturbing him  at this time  he was a bus driver  I understood that  he had to get up in the morning  and go drive the bus  then  when that  came about yesterday  I got girls 
[01:28:00]  in the basement  it had nothing to do  with you getting some sleep  that's why I was bothering you  that's why I had to turn my music down  how can I be disturbing you  what are you doing in there  you weren't reading the bible  damn  why not  the one thing I don't know  how did they pick up Ariel  where was he  did they just wait for him to come home  I don't know  they might even know where he was going  or maybe  has that even came out  how did they pick him up  and his two brothers  I don't know  there it is  McDLT  the hot side  and the cold side  why do we know that part of this 
[01:28:30]  maybe  we know every other detail  I don't know  I'm sure it'll come out  it's probably just some  what did they say  he was going to McDonald's  or something  I think he was going to McDonald's  as well  was he really  I think so  McDonald's is a little less  holy shit right  yeah a little less exposure here  what was the other food option  McDonald's  or the new goat shit palace  that opened up  we have cold goat shit  we have hot goat shit  we have goat shit  that's sliced and diced  and we have melted goat shit  you can eat it on  you can eat it on  peanut bread 
[01:29:00]  or panty bread  we don't know what it's called  or McDonald's  or you can eat it on  the folded scrotum of a horse  goat shit  wrapped in folded horse scrotum  or McDonald's  I think I'll go McDonald's  they all get along  at McDonald's  yeah  perbs, sex slaves, and heroes  they all  yeah  they all fuel their souls  with McDonald's  yes  we've all been brought together  Jesus  what did they say to you?  he told me  he said  you got who?  I said  I got 911  oh yeah 
[01:29:30]  he's talking about  the 911 operator  oh right  I got a man of beer  with me right now  I'm sitting to the police  and his dispatcher said  stop playing on this line  you don't got her  I said  well send the police  moron  and arrest me  if I'm lying  they took  they didn't believe me  now  now since so many people  have been calling them  probably through the years  and said we got it  I understand that  you was just a little  apprehensive about that call  she called too  now you got two people  calling 911 
[01:30:00]  at the same time  somebody can't be lying  how did Amanda look  when you finally rescued her?  fine  she was  trembling  happy that she saw  someone else  other than  her  she was shaking  and if you want a good shake  her main concern  was that child  I didn't know  what that baby  was crying about  did she come out  with the child?  yes  and I was like  who is this kid?  and she said 
[01:30:30]  well  this is his daughter  his daughter  and I'm like  well how?  she had a grimace  on her face  you weren't pregnant  then  and then they  will  do the math  say oh damn  well  it's okay  that's alright  oh that's alright  that's alright  thank god that's alright  that's alright  that's alright  the Cleveland guy  oh the stupid Cleveland guy  we understand  I think the Cleveland guy  used to be in New York too  you look pretty familiar  oh really?  that's why the guy  was taking her to the park though  it's his daughter too  to the park 
[01:31:00]  yeah  how do you fucking  decipher that shit  in your little brain  yeah  they're taking daddy away  good lord  hit him with a bat  hit him with a bat  hit the guy with a bat  she's gonna have  a little bit of baggage  there to deal with  a little bit  a few daddy issues perhaps  daddy was a what?  yeah  I'm here why?  yeah  how did I come around?  ugh  that's when Anthony  swoops in like a falcon  I smell daddy issues  like a fucking  like a vulture  smells like carcass 
[01:31:30]  and I react much  the same way  pick their bones  clean of meat  exactly  tell her legal to vote  then you just drop them somewhere  he talks about being a hero  ah  let me ask you this  you touched on this earlier  has it  sunk in  just how much  attention you're getting  as Aaron was pointing out earlier  you're trending  on Twitter  the world is talking about  what you did  your name is all over the place  it's a hashtag  Chuck Ramsey 
[01:32:00]  everywhere  do you have any idea  of the attention  that you're getting  around the world right now?  I don't even want it  nor looking for it bro  that's why  when they keep saying  I'm a hero  let me tell you something  I'm American  and I'm a human being  a hero ain't nothing  but a sandwich  as is the big man  there was a woman  in distress  so why turn your back  on that  on that dress  my father  would have whooped  the hell out of me  if he had found out  that I was  coward out  see you tough  in these bars  but you won't  and you beat a woman 
[01:32:30]  but you won't help one out  and you're a man huh  no I'm the definition  of a man bro  were you ever concerned  that Ariel would come back  I am a man  yes  only because  I  was doing something  that I had no business doing  which was  prying his door open  on his property  so he had every right  to you know  getting some type of  altercation with me  because I'm on  fiber property  even though I'm doing  a good deed  he's still on my property  you know what I'm saying  so I was thinking about him 
[01:33:00]  but at the time  and I got  you know  I wish you'd bring  my squad with me  I got an entourage  so we weren't worried  about Ariel anyway  that's why I told the police  if we had known  about this  you would have never  got that call  it would have just been  some corners coming  putting a white sheet  over somebody  and we would have  went on with our life  because we would have  handled that bro  we would have handled  the situation  he's talking about that  yeah I'm a hero  I'm all nice and shit  but this could have  gone the other way  motherfucker  kung fu fighting  yeah 
[01:33:30]  they found Ariel  at McDonald's  they really did  they honestly did  yes  that's hilarious  no fucking way  yes  that's coming in  Jesus  they got them  at McDonald's  man  that area  loves their McDonald's  holy fuck  well again  you know  the goat shit palace  is the only other place  yes  the only other option  it really gets a bum rap  the goat shit palace  yes it does  and now  Charles Ramsey  wants to get his hands  on the person 
[01:34:00]  that did this  Ariel I believe  as you said  you have an entourage  and your manager  over there  is saying you have to leave  but let me ask you  one last question  before you go  you talked about  you're not a hero  you were doing  what you had to do  knowing what you did  knowing the attention  that you're getting  knowing how grateful  people are  that because of you  these ladies are now free  how do you feel today  oh I'm uh  I'm alright  I'm uh  I want to get my hands on him  and then I'll be alright  put me in the face  over there with him 
[01:34:30]  and I'll be alright  other than that  I mean it is what it is bro  you know  God's smiling on somebody  you know what I mean  yeah  alright  hey Chuck  thanks man  oh yeah  we appreciate it  really appreciate it  good luck to you  you too bro  he gave him that personal touch  yeah  hey Chuck  good luck Chuck  I feel  I feel like I won  that McDonald's  Monopoly game  they do every so often  I feel like I won  like the grand prize  of the motherfucker  how are you feeling  that you've rescued  these people 
[01:35:00]  I'm loving it  I'm loving it  more awkward moments  can you turn your head  and cough  epic fails  that was a shitty joke  that barbed  and fouled mouth rants  why don't you  shut the fuck up  coming up  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2013  so far  so far  continues  next  welcome back  it's the worst 
[01:35:30]  of 2013  so far  Opie and Anthony  are on vacation  all week  so in the meantime  I'm Sam Roberts  and I'll be bringing  to you  the best moments  that have happened  this year  on the Opie and Anthony  thus far  for instance  our engineer  Mars  people have asked  for a long time  what the fuck  is wrong  with this guy  possibly something  in his upbringing  well that's exactly  what it was  Mars came forward  one day  and got very truthful  about his mother  and the way  his mother raised him 
[01:36:00]  quite some time ago  I believe  somewhere in Puerto Rico  he says it was  in the United States  of America  but you listen  to the guy talk  there's no way  he was raised  in the United States  of America  this is Mars  our engineer  explaining to us  the abuse  and the horrible  childhood that he had  at the hands  of his mother  ONA's worst  of 2013  so far  I don't want to  I don't want to  hit my kids  or anything  give them that  fucking fetish  right  I think as a parent  you're the one 
[01:36:30]  that gives your kids  their fetishes  indirectly  don't you think  yes absolutely  if you spank  your daughter  a lot  guess what  I think she might  get into that  when she gets older  right  yep  that whole  pulling down  the pants  and smacking  that's  it's bizarre  I can't even  imagine doing that  but even  I come from  a generation  where that happened  but I can't  imagine as a father  like I'm gonna  pull your pants  now and spank you  get the fuck  out of here  listen I used to  creepy  I used to get  my ass beat  yeah  beat  and I don't  touch my kids 
[01:37:00]  man  you don't do  that shit  it's just wrong  you got beat  oh fuck  badly  yeah  yeah I got beat  badly  my family was a lot  of yelling  so I don't yell  at my kids  no I got hit  with extension cords  belts  extension cords  sucks  that's a rough one  wow  you were a bad kid  no she was a bad mother  oh you had a bad mom  yeah  where's she now  she's uh  in New Jersey  she's alive  I still deal with her  look you're uncomfortable  to this day  you're uncomfortable  why was she bad  she'd beat you a lot  ah she did a lot 
[01:37:30]  of fucking things  to me that I got  wait do you have  a relationship with her  oh so you're  uncomfortable  because you're  scared this might  get back to her  I don't give a fuck  but no you do  you do  I see it in your eyes  what would she do  that's a little uncomfortable  what would she do  that was so bad  dude she burned my hands  how  with a spatula  why  on purpose  because I stole  what'd you steal  some papers  papers from what  a ream of paper  what's a ream  I don't know what a ream is  a ream  a ream of paper  from her  no from school  why would you steal paper 
[01:38:00]  from school  that's like the worst  thing to steal  a kid's stupid  yeah but what  what do you need paper for  no reason  just to  kids want to avoid paper  just the act  of stealing  that's all  how old were you  maybe nine  I think  she burned your hand  at nine  for just silly shit  that all kids do  the way she did it  too man  she got me really good  she was acting  like she was  frying some eggs  she had me sit  next to her  on the stove  by the stove  and she told me 
[01:38:30]  to put my hands out  for a second  I had no idea  this was coming  no idea  so I put my hands out  and she takes it  the spatula was already  in the oil  in the frying pan  and she took it  straight from the frying pan  and slapped my hand  I moved one hand  left the other one there  she got the other one  oh  burned both hands  badly  badly  um  nine  I'm fucking so mad  right now  I'm telling you bro  I don't even know her  let me tell you  I barely know you  I went to school  not by his choice 
[01:39:00]  I know  he might do some things  for me though soon  yeah  he might help  help out my TVs  and shit  and TV  um  time is so much  different nowadays  because I went to school  and no one really  you had marks on your hands  yeah  I had bandages and stuff  and no one really  got into the story  did you keep the  spatula down on your hands  or just kind of slapped it  just slapped it  but that's the damage  oh because the oil  was on it  yeah  so that oil  was what was burning  the oil would stay on  I'm sorry  yeah  if she takes the spatula  out of the hot oil 
[01:39:30]  it's the oil  that's really burning  yeah  and what did she say  was like  this is for stealing  Jimmy to be honest with you  I don't remember man  I don't  I just remember the action  and how much I  can't stand  now  what else  did your family  your family  react to that  or no  do you get all  freaky when people  are flying  do you like fried food  wait  no  I hate fried food  and yes they reacted  and they  you know  sorry  they told her  you know  it's not right 
[01:40:00]  shouldn't be doing this  but no one really  stepped up to the plate  and you know  did anything else  was she mentally ill  no she's got some issues  though  she's got to have  some issues  she's nasty  she's a nasty individual  yeah  who did she live with  with her  with her husband  your dad  no  of course not  you're Puerto Rican  I forgot  you guys go through  a few right  yeah but she  yeah I've been through  some  wait your stepdad  was he nice to you  oh he's a fucking saint  yeah that's usually  the case right  the fucking dude's a saint  usually the case  you get one whacked out  fucking parent  and the other one's a saint

[01:41:00]  you wind up coming  at the house at three  and then act like  it's no big deal  if I invite you  and say hey  how many of you guys  coming  I need a number  just so I can prepare  yeah  she thinks it's probably  a little too white of me  and  doesn't matter  how many people  I bring  so then now  let's say I have  a kids party  Mars has OCD  because he got hit  in the hands  with hot oil  that's OCD shit  who gives a fuck  probably  but you also want to know  it also  when you're hosting  you want to know  yeah but how many people  is she bringing 
[01:41:30]  instead of two  she's bringing three  and that bothers you  or is it  or is it she bringing  the whole fucking neighborhood  well check it out  we're creating a nice  birthday party  for the kids  does she ruin it  and we want to go ahead  and give goodie bags  to the kids  we're very good like that  gotcha  so I ask you  how many kids  are you bringing  none  kids come  now I have two kids  with no goodie bags  now I have to  I don't want the kids  feeling all fucked up  you gotta make a few  extra goodie bags  yeah so we do  but it would be better  if she were to tell me  in advance  there's a lot of shit 
[01:42:00]  I am so on your side  I'm just fucking around  with you  does she ruin  does she ruin  the birthday party  no she ruined  my fucking wedding  how'd she ruin your wedding  she came an hour late  to your wedding  yeah  was she in the wedding party  or no  no  but just you know  we're waiting on her  you know  because you're not going  to start the ceremony  look at how biting is  oh yeah  but that's  that's self obsession  wow  she's a narcissist  probably  she tries  she makes it about herself  right  all the time  that's what  all the time  in my entire life  she comes to the fucking house  and she will sit there  and she'll start asking me 
[01:42:30]  where are the Spanish channels  on the fucking cable  so then I gotta go  and find the Spanish channel  so she can watch  her fucking telenovelas  well she's in my house  she hasn't been around for  bro you have no idea  holy fuck  you guys have no idea  what's going on right now  you have no idea  he's all dry mouth  Jimmy just gave him water  his eyes have changed  well she's obviously  a narcissist  he grew up with a narcissist  who was fucking abusive  and it's  how many kids did she have  two  you and who  my sister  does your sister get along  yeah  she's the favorite  I'm the scumbag  I'm the scumbag 
[01:43:00]  who's older  I went to college  I made good money  she was a scumbag  because you were stealing  your whole life  I married white  all my kids are white  so I'm a scumbag  oh she's one of those  I'm a scumbag  you should have married  Spanish right  I don't know  I don't let her get  I don't let her  get that out  get it out  I right away tell her  that there's no way  that I would ever marry  a Hispanic woman  why?  we've been through this before  well the reason is obviously  because if it's her  he hates her  so he doesn't want to marry 
[01:43:30]  someone who's like his mom  which is probably normal  probably  because she turned to shit  after the two kids  her body turned into  a disaster zone  so I was like  I don't want a woman like that  that doesn't take care of herself  after having kids  and now my wife  takes great care of herself  but it's also because  she was nasty too  Mars is really fucked up right now  yeah he's crazy  I wasn't expecting this  what else did she do to you?  she made me kneel on a  we have this  you know  pasteles  no  okay pasteles is a dish 
[01:44:00]  there's got to be  the English word for that  they wrap it in plantain leaves  and it's plantains  blended together  with meat in it  and it's  over Christmas  it's a big dish  well that thing  back in the day  because we didn't have  food processors back in the day  the grater  grate like this  the cheese grater  the cheese grater I guess  it's about  yo high  yo high you're showing  yeah I'm sorry  about  ten inches  off the table  ten inches  and  that cunt made me  kneel on that shit 
[01:44:30]  she made you kneel on it?  yes  for what?  I don't know man  whatever you say for what  I don't know  I just know that  yeah  she made me kneel on that shit  for a long time  it seemed long to me  it's hard to put  your two knees  with all your weight  on that shit  and that was your punishment?  yeah and I would  I would cheat  I would take one leg off  and she would come  and smack me  and I had to put the fuck  what a sick fuck man  you know I got yelled at a lot  mine shit was more like a  I'll tell you about the MMA  emotional shit 
[01:45:00]  but bullshit  I didn't get shit like that  I don't think  I wasn't blocking that out  I'll tell you about the MMA shit  look at your eyes  you alright?  yeah I'm getting a little  up there but  the MMA shit  I'll tell you  one day she caught me  after school  and it was just her and I  and this woman actually  put her hands up  and said  we're gonna fight  I'm gonna fuck you up  she said that to you?  I'm serious  I'm not bullshit  maybe this is 12  this is exhausting  oh my god  dude  Joe  dude  you have to 
[01:45:30]  whatever the fuck I did  we're gonna fight  I'm serious  can you imagine  going home to that type of  unpredictability  well  I  well I guess you probably could  I'm not gonna make it  I could so make this about myself  I won't  we'll do it another day  yes I can imagine Sam  is the answer  but it was different in my house  go ahead  so she's  we're gonna fight  yeah  she's pissed  whatever the fuck I did  she puts up her hair  and says we're gonna fight  and I said  what are you doing  you're my mother  she's like I'm gonna fuck you up  you better block  why did she wanna fuck you up 
[01:46:00]  I don't know  was she a drunk  no  but you have to  no drugs  no drugs at all  and no drinking  and that's why I think drugs are great  people like her  fucking no drugs  give me a break  you're a drug addict  huh  I smoke my weed  drug addict  no  and you'd love to get her  to smoke some weed  and fucking relax a little bit  yeah  or take something  that's fucking  for being bipolar  or whatever it is  wait a minute  so  hold on though man  you gotta know  why she wanted to fight you  that day  yeah  dude I've been  so many altercations 
[01:46:30]  with her  I have no idea  what do you think  it was about  some dumb little stupid thing  yeah misbehaving  were you a bad kid growing up  no  I mean the nine year old  stealing the paper  that seems like more normal  that's all I did  I'm just growing up shit  that's it  simple things like that  alright that's why  I'm trying to like  establish something  you weren't a bad kid  you weren't like  fucking dealing drugs  none of that shit  you pretty much  listened to what she  told you to do  exactly  okay  because I get that feeling  that you were that type of kid  you know  which makes this shit worse 
[01:47:00]  by the way  that's why I'm establishing it  just a little fist fights  with my friends  perhaps you know  a little stealing  here and there  nothing really bad  nothing  now smoking  came later  not during this time  so anyhow  she commences  and starts  swinging on me  and she knocks me down  and you remember  back in the day guys  back when you were  growing up  we had these big  stereo systems  with the two speakers  on the side  the record player  in the middle  the radio  and the TV  she didn't go  WWE on you 
[01:47:30]  did she  when she knocks me down  I go underneath  the stereo system  and I had a little ledge  so my head goes in  sideways  but she mounts me  so I turn  my head is facing  directly upward  so now my head is stuck  you're crammed under there  yes  and this bitch is  fucking me up  she's punching me  and looking at me  with her eyes going  huh  huh  where is she punching you  in the face  wow  god damn 
[01:48:00]  yep  see  she was  she was an abusive  shitty narcissist  you were never  coming to my house  why  no  that shit's gonna come out  that's bullshit  because now with my kids  I am the best thing  there is man  let me tell you  I love my children  I would never ever  I would talk  you know like  I perhaps smack them  in the back of the head  one time  but nothing  you wouldn't challenge them  to a fist fight  a knife fight  maybe  we're gonna fight  imagine coming home  and she squares off 
[01:48:30]  and let's go  that's why you do MMA shit  it's so obvious  why do you deal with her  at all at this point  like why not just  like I don't understand  why you deal with your mom  like you're an adult  like you cut her out  fuck her  yeah I barely deal with mine  because I can't deal with it  cut her  there's one way to handle that  it is to cut them out  like a cancer  but then you got a  decent wife  that wants to have  the grandparents  involved in the life  and you try  and I'm trying  how does she treat  your children  now my wife 
[01:49:00]  is getting the idea  now she's beginning  to realize  is she still a twat  your mom  when she comes over  or is it  yeah but now  she's into the church  she's like going to church  every day  and you know  now she's thinking  you think she has some guilt  absolutely  yeah  does she ever acknowledge  the things that she did  no  they rarely do  they rarely do  they could reason  they could give you  some reasoning  for anything they've done  it was the time  let me tell you something else  down by wall 
[01:49:30]  wait wait wait  was there like a man  in the house  yes my father  he would never put his hands on me  your father father  yes  and I bet you  he just allowed her  to just wreak havoc  right  yes  what do you think  that's about  he said that  if he were to put his hands  on me  he would kill me  because he was a bodybuilder  well why did he allow  your mom to do that shit  because I wonder that  I guess he was probably  either fucking around  I don't know  he didn't care  he didn't care  but that wasn't unusual  back then  he pretty much looked  the other way though  when your mom's like 
[01:50:00]  we're going to fight  was he in the house  when he  no  no that particular incident  the hand burning incident  all those really serious incidents  no one else was in the house  her sadistic stuff  she was alone with  yes  so he was  he was usually out  when she would do  what was the other thing  she did  we were at  I said Wall Street  my bad  it was one center street  we were going to court  for some reason  I forget what it was  right  and it's fucking  bitter cold  I'm talking about  what it was  a couple of days ago 
[01:50:30]  cold  right  we're outside  and she  and we're  I'm telling  it's freezing  and she looks at me  and I don't know  what I said  or what I did  those things  I can't recall  it must have been  something not so good  but she tells me  if you cut your eyes at me  once more  I'm going to smack you  in this cold  I guess I cut my eyes man  because that fucking bitch  hit me so hard  and let me tell you  when your face is freezing cold  yeah  yeah  I will remember that 
[01:51:00]  for the rest of my life man  that's the getting hit  in ice cold  is the fucking worst  yes  you got tears in your eyes man  I'd fucking bother us  a little bit  no that's alright  it's not easy  like that  like you know  what I  put up with  when I was a kid  and now that I'm a father  that's when it kills you  like you look at your kids  and go  I can't even imagine  like doing any of this shit  to my kids  right  yeah  and I'm sorry to say  a lot of this  Latino bullshit  like for example 
[01:51:30]  today I saw a fucking video  of a fucking kid  getting tattooed  right  put  a mother's  actually  having a tattoo artist  put a tattoo  on a fucking baby  how old  I don't know  three  how old's the baby  less than two  less than two  what kind of tattoo  um  bro star  yeah  what kind of tattoo  I don't know  I don't give a fuck  I was so angry  fuck wife  and it's gonna be stupid  because he's gonna grow up  and the fucking tattoo  is gonna stretch  right 
[01:52:00]  is that something  that's happening  in the community  I don't know  it's something  that means something  to the mother  that will mean  nothing to the baby  right  it's just again  more self-centeredness  by a parent  Marge  did you ever ask her  what  did you know her father  or her parents  yes  I knew her father  he was a barber  he was pretty rough with them  so she kind of got beat up  so yeah  the cycle continues  yeah  he used to beat her up  beat all of them up  so you're breaking the cycle  oh absolutely  being broken  is this real  this is real  what the fuck 
[01:52:30]  is this world star hip hop yo  yo  let's see this shit  world star  what is this  cunt  getting tattooed  on the baby  and why  would a tattoo artist  accept this  he needs business  this bad  is that reggaeton  in the background  reggaeton  how traumatic  why is this happening 
[01:53:00]  what a fucking cunt  she's holding the kid down  how awful  just so she can show her kid off  what a terrible  fucking cunt  of a woman  you know  before I had kids  it wouldn't bother me  as much  this  fuck 
[01:53:30]  what's wrong  with people  the fuck  is wrong  with people  what kind of tattoo  is this  it'll mean something  to her  like this self-centered  bitch  what's the description  on this video  nothing  why the fuck  would you do that  to your kid  there's no explanation  for that  I don't give a shit  what it is  what culture you're in  you don't do that shit  to a child  he has  he has no concept  that's just  a completely traumatic  experience  it's all about her  it's all about her 
[01:54:00]  and what she wants  so she can show him off  so she can talk about it  it's just  what the fuck  is that about  does anyone know  no clue  is that something  that's now going on  no definitely not  it's probably been  happening forever though  like when you look  at the tribes  you look at tribes  in the way kids  are tattooed  or whatever  I'm sure that's common  but not in modern  day living  it shouldn't be  yeah it's not  like a trend  right no  oh my god  I still want to know  why Mars doesn't  cut his mother  out of his life  like I said 
[01:54:30]  it's tough  because you know  you realize in the end  it's your mom  so it's a weird thing  no I could easily  cut people off  trust me  no you can't  because she's still  in your life  you've only given us  three things  that are horrific  I'm sure there's others  it's really because  of my wife  she squares off  and says let's fight  my wife is the  very decent individual  that wants grandma  she just wants everyone  to get along  and she doesn't understand  I tell my wife  the same stuff  I'm like don't worry  about it  I'm like our kids  have two great  grandparents in Philly  don't worry about  making this work 
[01:55:00]  because it's not  going to work  and I'm cool with it  I make it better  I tell her  you don't want that  fucking element in your life  right  in your kid's life  growing up  you know  your wife's trying  to do the right thing  she doesn't understand  there's one way  to do it  that is to cut them  out  completely  and the wives  don't understand  you've got to tell them  you don't get it  I'm not going to hurt  the kid  because you don't get it  I grew up with  one grandma  and she was  beyond amazing  and I had another  quote  grandma alive 
[01:55:30]  that we never saw  which we've talked  about a lot  on this show  but I had one  amazing grandma  that's all I know  and I'm totally fine  with that  that's all you need  I'm completely fine  with that  she was amazing  she made up  for everything else  as far as  grandparents go  yeah  what happened  to your real dad  by the way  oh I don't know  they broke up  and I haven't heard  from him  for years now  what year did he leave  like how old were you  like 10 or 11  I was  I was about  19, 20  oh you were an adult  I was already 
[01:56:00]  I got this whole thing  figured out  okay  your mom hated  your father  she couldn't stand him  and you looked  like your father  absolutely  mirror image  that's  I'm a mirror  that happens a lot  and then  you look like  your father  who she fucking  hated for whatever  reason he was  cheating or doing  whatever  he did her wrong  in her fucking  stupid mind  and you look  just like the dude  so she took it  out on you  because she really  wanted to take it  out on him  and I also have  a little bit  of his attitude  so  right  that doesn't help 
[01:56:30]  so he just  disappeared  he probably got  no he got fed up  they got divorced  clean  but why wouldn't  he keep in touch  with you  he's an asshole  he's another asshole  you don't like him  no he's an asshole  another one  I had two assholes  rearing me  bringing me up  but he just didn't  hit you  no he didn't  hit me  he was just  but he was done  when you were  19  dude  I don't remember  getting a hug  and a kiss  from my father  and I don't want  to make this  a hoo hoo  but I haven't  I've never  kissed my father  zero affection 
[01:57:00]  zero affection bro  or a hug  do you know  how much  I hug  and kiss  my boy  man  did you want  to kiss  him on the lips  no  you could tell  a little bit  no  but see you don't  do that shit  man  you want a hug  just to see how  no not from you  I didn't say  from me  I was going to  find someone  to hug you  you implied it  no I don't  want to hug you  I didn't find you  a hug  you want to hug  you or no  rarely  coldly  oh  yeah  my parents  were fucked up 
[01:57:30]  they didn't  take drugs  the sons of bitches  I can't say  they were  lacking  and they were  going to work  they were  on time  they were there  every day  one was a  bodybuilder  they kept me  in catholic school  who was a  bodybuilder  my father  oh so he was  on the steroids  probably  he was a pretty  big guy  so you know  I don't know  probably  I don't give a fuck  did he hit her  I saw that  happen  you don't know  I don't know  if it was a hit 
[01:58:00]  but I saw that  when I was a little  kid she was  crying on the floor  and screaming  and crying  and he left  and I don't know  what that was about  perhaps it was a hit  I don't know  but never ever  after that  I was real little  he would never  do things like that  he would say  he was too big  too strong  to put his hands  on us  right  so he wouldn't  were your parents  young when they  had you  I think so  yeah  relatively young  20s  that's not too young  well early 20s  you know  yeah that was  more commonplace  yeah 
[01:58:30]  for a man of your age  I'm like  not feeling right  right now  well it's weird  to talk about stuff  because it's coming out  don't you ever  wonder what happened  to him  not really  because I do  I  there was a lot  that I miss  from a father  a lot  a lot  you know  throwing  I mean  just  I don't know  just  I don't know  you know  like you teach  a kid  like he would  teach  he taught me 
[01:59:00]  not to get  into fights  meanwhile  here comes  this bully  and fucking  cracks me in the eye  and I've come home  with a fucking black eye  oh you're gonna start  martial arts school  tomorrow  why  why couldn't you  start from the beginning  you know  with your son  anybody  you know  puts his hands on you  you know  things like that  like my son  he didn't give you  any lessons  no lessons  no lessons in life  you know  nothing like that  and he didn't protect you  from the fucking bully  no  your mother  he did come through  one time  with a bully  but that's another 
[01:59:30]  what did he do  when I was getting  16  17  I got into  I got jumped  and  you grew up in a  bad neighborhood  Washington Heights  that's pretty bad  it's pretty bad  not as bad as  you know  there's worse places  yes  yeah  but Washington Heights  you can find a lot of things  you know  so  anyhow  so this guy  beats me up  along with his buddies  and Jose was his name  fuck him  we don't  we don't know his last name  but fuck him  he's a dirt bag  anyway  and I went back home 
[02:00:00]  aisle bloodied up  I was broken arm  and my father  you had a broken arm  yeah  it was  that  the broken arm  was from hitting  from hitting him  I didn't hit right  I hit him in the top of the head  I busted my  like Anthony  when he hit  Boomer Sison  when he was a kid  broke one of your bones  and he rest  so then  so then when I went home  I told my father  and he got pretty pissed  and he heard of Jose  and where he hung out  and he went over there 
[02:00:30]  you know  and scared the shit  out of all of them  they all saw this big guy  coming  ready to fuck him up  that was about it  you know  so they never bothered you again  no  no  no  I  no  I tried  tried getting mine back  but he went to jail  oh okay  for what  who the fuck knows  he was a dust head  you know  PCP  Jesus Mars  what  fuck  so your mom still  her mom lives in Jersey now  so she's still close unfortunately  yeah  20 minutes away  and that's too long  that's too much for her to drive 
[02:01:00]  do you have to pick her up  or do people  fuck no  that won't happen  that won't happen  oh she tells you  yeah  she has no interest in your grandkids  I would assume  no man  my little girl Olivia  she's always asking for her  in this fucking bitch  see that's why  you know what  it's better they don't know  yeah exactly  my kids won't know  so they won't be asking  yes  honey  listen  I can talk to your wife  I know I can  there's no need for that bitch  to be in my life man  or in my kids life  you know  and then the kids are asking  because they don't know  all this shit 
[02:01:30]  look let me  let me  let me  let me  let me give you  another insight  right  they're still like  you know  back in the day  type of shit  they don't make  that much money  so they live in an apartment  so this woman  oh she's gonna hate  when I say this  this woman right  she's so fucking  yeah  she's so fucking lazy  that she won't go  to the bathroom  so she has one of those  spit tunes  those white  sparkle buckets  almost like a bedpan  yeah bedpan  but you know  it's got  it's got that white covering 
[02:02:00]  to put in  you know what I mean  it's white and blue  is it made for peeing in  yeah  some shit like that  okay  so okay  so she'd rather  piss in there  than go  20 feet  to the bathroom  okay  that's your business  I don't give a shit  that's your life  no you can't even downplay  that's fucking weird  it is weird  how long has she been doing that  I'm going to  all her life  all her life  so  okay  so that's her business  she'd rather  wait a minute  she'd rather pee 
[02:02:30]  in like  let's just call it  a bedpan type of thing  instead of go to the bathroom  in the middle of the night  what she do it in front of people  no in the middle of the night  I'm sorry  in the middle of the night  this is for when she sleeps  I'm sorry  is she fat  no  is she really lazy  or do you think that  when her father would get a hold of her  when she'd go to the bathroom  when she was a kid  so she learned to fucking  just piss in her room  I never analyzed that  that's based on something  Jimmy's right  that's just too weird  so  in the middle of the night  she won't go to the bathroom  she'd rather  do that  there  in that bedpan  does she get out of bed  to do this  yes of course 
[02:03:00]  so if you're getting out of bed  why wouldn't you go to the bathroom  I don't know  anyhow  so my point is this  I tell my wife  I explain that to her  and I says  do you really want  your kids  to go and see that shit  in the morning  because she has to transport  that pee  and piss  and whatever  to the bathroom  do you really think  you want your fucking kids  to see that shit  well I don't  so they never stay there  you know  that's gross  that type of shit  if they stay there  who else stays there with her  her husband 
[02:03:30]  what do you mean  if they stay there  if like they stay for an overnight  yeah but you're not there  oh no that doesn't happen  yeah exactly  why would you do that  the kids don't go there  without you right  no  so why does her husband  tolerate do you think  she probably gives up  some good shit  that's why  he used to have  an outhouse too  back when he grew up  so he's probably  used to that kind of shit  you know  right  but her nastiness  I don't know  why he puts up with it  is she dirty  nah she's very clean  she's very clean  except for the pee  all over the place 
[02:04:00]  she is very clean  in the bedroom  fucking peeing herself  instead of going to bed  this is fucking ridiculous  I can't believe  I'm talking about this  I get some shit  out of people  she probably doesn't  listen to the show  she can't fucking  even speak English  she doesn't speak English  all these years  she's lazy  lazy  not gonna learn  lives in her community  where they all speak Spanish  science of Spanish  you know  the fucking TV Spanish  so she doesn't need  to speak English  she thinks you're a little  sellout from a white girl 
[02:04:30]  and for fucking whitening up your life  I'm the worst  I'm the worst  I went to college  I make good money  you know  I live in a very nice neighborhood  you know  that's another thing  I invite  okay  whoa  slow down  Mars  turn it into the Mars show  alright guys  you know  I invite them over  to come over to the neighborhood  like to do trick or treating  you know  Halloween and shit  you know  it's too much for them  the way they act  it's not too much for them  because they drive over  it's too much for them  to deal with people 
[02:05:00]  of our caliber  who's them  whites  whites  no no no  you said  you live in a white neighborhood  Mars you live in a white neighborhood  oh no  my sister  oh your sister's on your mom's side  a little bit  just a little bit  she's trying to get away from that  because I live in a white neighborhood  you think they're jealous  that you have this nice life  and they have to go back  it's like  sometimes you don't want to go somewhere nice  then it's a relative comparison  to what you have  okay I agree with that  if that is the case  then if you have  a niece or a nephew  or a grandchild  then I tell you 
[02:05:30]  bring her over  so she can you know  grow up with my kids  and hang out in this area  but just get a little  out of that Newark shit  no  they just  they make up excuses  and all that  so I'm like okay  that little kid  is going to grow up to be  it's you know  a luck of the draw  it's a shitty group  it is  it is  Karis  you got a good family  it sounds like  I know  but then you  gives a fuck about everyone else  yeah but you got a little  baby girl there  that could use some help  you know  and I see it  you know  wait  whose baby girl  my sister's 
[02:06:00]  oh  oh  you're worried about her  I was like  you know  bring her over  bring her over  show her the white world  show her where the rich people live  the beautiful white world  does your sister live in poverty  no  Newark  no no  they live okay  but it's in Newark  it's the neighborhood stinks  yeah  oh  and you  I hear you  so you wish a little  better for your  your niece  yeah  there's a type of place  like you don't see this  where you live  obviously  but uh  where pit bulls  with their masters  are roaming the streets 
[02:06:30]  but with no leash  and you got a fucking  uh  two year old  running around  what's that like  is that like  a ghetto statement  like I can control this dog  without it being on a leash  like a dominance  I think so  it's ridiculous  no one curbs their dog  no one cleans up  after their dog  you know  that type of stuff  but your sister's fine  living like that  she's got no choice  I guess  she a single mom  no  no  what does the father do  he works  he does work 
[02:07:00]  that's  that's fucking interesting man  it really is  very interesting  oh man  the best part is  we're gonna fight  that's crazy  there's enough  there's enough shit  to deal with  as a 12 year old  you're trying to figure out  what the fuck's  going on  and now you gotta go home  and square off  with your own mom  I can remember  like  trying to avoid bullies  and be like  oh I can't wait  to just get home  and then I'm safe 
[02:07:30]  until tomorrow  right  I can't imagine  like  you were brought up  in a relatively good neighborhood  man  what bullies  were fucking with you  at school  everybody  you know  every bunch of people  at school  yeah  so you get home  and you're like  okay  I'm in these four walls  everything is cool  because I'm at home  and you get home  and when you get home  is when this woman  is saying  oh my god  yo we're gonna fight  put your  I love  I love  hearing from like  guys like Sam  that have no idea  he had like  a really like  good upbringing 
[02:08:00]  in his house  my house was the  wild wild west  it was way safer  to be out of the house  are you kidding me  me too  I used to be the one  I feared when that sun  started going down  I'm like  oh fuck  and maybe this was  a product of that  but I was doing  more of the  bullying  and being mischievous  at school  and starting fights  and things like that  I wasn't  when I used the  term bully  before  when I got  hit in the eye  that wasn't really  a bullying  he tried  and I stepped to him  like fuck you 
[02:08:30]  he was a lot bigger  than me  but got my ass kicked  but it wasn't really  a bullying action  like no one really  bullied me  you know  I had this bitch  at home  ain't nobody bullied  yeah I'm gonna take  abuse at home  there's no fucking way  I'm gonna take abuse  from anyone else  so maybe that's  about it  yeah  yeah this is a very  good question  coming in from  Cigars and Scotch  Cigars  hey what's going on guys  hey man  who was your  toughest training  sparring partner  was it an MMA fighter 
[02:09:00]  or an M-O-M-M-A fighter  the latter  she was tough  makes sense  that you train now  no one's gonna fuck  with Mars anymore  I never thought about it  at what age  did you realize  no one's gonna fuck  with Mars anymore  oh young man  I was young  I was still in the house  everyone's going  with the M-O-M-M-A joke  funny  we have a match today  Joe and Jersey  have the same fucking line  hey you wanna go on  Maury  we know Maury  I'm not a sob story bro 
[02:09:30]  I'm not a sob story  I'm just  talking  let me say hi to  I don't know  Ken in Chicago  looks like  Ken what's up  hey what's going on man  hey  hi Ken  hey you know  I just wanted to give a call  man cause it was funny  I just turned you guys on  and I was listening  it was like listening to myself  talking on the radio man  with your story  your upbringing  and I can totally relate to you  and I can tell you one thing  if I've learned nothing  from life man  when people are stuck 
[02:10:00]  in situations like that  growing up man  it either breaks you  or makes you  and obviously  much like myself  I came from a house  where my mother  was very successful  in the medical field  here in Chicago  and she was nothing  but a pill popper  and abusing morphine patches  and my father  was kind of a dissident  here and there  and that made me  the person I am  I bought my house  when I was 19  I got two young kids  a beautiful wife  that I can cherish  and like you man  you gotta judge the situation  and with my mom 
[02:10:30]  and my dad  I didn't want  that effect on my children  so I cut them off  completely now  and now  I thank God  I have the wonderful  grandparents for my kids  through my wife  and I can do nothing  but congratulating man  for making it through  what you have man  thanks man  I would love to talk  to a psychologist  about it  because what motivates you  because like you said  and Maris has said  I got some similar shit too  you either  it either breaks you  and you follow 
[02:11:00]  the same path  and you don't break  the fucking chain  of abuse  whether it's physical  or emotional  or you go completely  the other way  and say fuck that  I'm not doing this  to my kids  it stops right here  what's the turning point  for people  where they can decide  I'll do the same shit  because this is all I know  or I'm gonna fucking  do it different  because I've had it  I would love a psychologist  to answer that question  no I mean for me  by all means  I was  I party all the time 
[02:11:30]  partied hard  I never touched  any type of illegal drugs  because I kind of saw  what it did to my mom  I never did any type  of drugs whatsoever  but to stop you  other people would do drugs  because that's all they know  yeah you know  I guess I see my  defective in my mom  because literally  for about a 10 year span  up until I moved out  of my house  basically from the age  of 9 to 19  I watched my mom  and saw her  about 5 minutes a day  she would go to work  before we woke up  she would come home  at 5, 6 o'clock  in the afternoon  she would go directly  into her bedroom  and go to sleep  and that was my experience  that was my total experience 
[02:12:00]  with my mother  for 10 years  and by seeing  what it did to her  that's what drove me  not to do it  but I think the biggest  thing in my life  was just all the hardships  and seeing how  I guess ultimately  selfish my parents were  you know  they would  they would deprive  me and my children  my sisters  of things  that were basic things  like hey dad  you know  my shoes are worn out  can I get a new pair  I'll go to the  Ovation Army  meanwhile  he's sitting there  he's buying  another truck  for his company  or something like that  something that was  unnecessary  and all  and I saw that  and since I've had 
[02:12:30]  my daughter  my daughter was born  April 11, 2006  and she was 4 pounds  7 ounces  she was in the  neonatal intensive care unit  for almost 40 days  and on top of it all  I had a lapse of insurance  because I was between jobs  so I was stuck  with $270,000  in medical debt  I almost blocked my house  we went through negotiations  to drop it  but when I was  really hard up  and I was on the verge  of losing my house  my mom  like I said  she's up there  as far as the medical field  in Chicago  she makes a lot of money  and I asked my mom 
[02:13:00]  even though our relationship  was rocking  mom can you lend me  $3,000  just so I can make it  come back  I said I'll pay you back  within a month  I'll do side jobs  work whatever I have to  to do it  but I need the money now  and she looked at me  dead in the eye  and said me and your father  did it  you can do it too  and that was it  and walked away  yeah  and you know what  I just talked to myself  you know what  I'm not going to be that parent  I'm going to give my children  everything they need  not everything they want  but everything they need  in life  that they deserve  and you obviously  I work  typically on an average week 
[02:13:30]  60-65 hours a week  on call for 24 coverage  24-7 coverage  for my company  I have almost 3 months  that I'm on call this year  and I'll put that time in  so I can give my family  the thing they need  you know my children  are going to Catholic school  my son's got a speech disability  we hire a private  speech therapist  just come to the house  and invest the money  in my children  instead of taking it away  from like it was to me  you know  I guess I look at the reflection  and try to think to myself  I don't want to be that person  you know  and obviously it's worked for you man  because you hear the things 
[02:14:00]  that you've gone through  and look how far you've come now  you know  you've taken all the negative energy  and put it towards something  that was worthwhile  and made something to yourself  you know  I want to congratulate you  you just  that was the longest sentence ever  longest sentence ever  called Guinness Book of World Records  holy shit  what pisses me off about your story  you didn't put yourself  in that horrible financial spot  I could see if you did it to yourself  then maybe 
[02:14:30]  you know  a parent would go  look man  you got yourself into this mess  you got to get yourself out  you  oh yeah  you didn't do that to yourself  I think we're learning  you needed desperate help there  we're learning  is  you have to be a good boy  when you're growing up  and bad boys like Mars  and this man  just make things difficult  for the adults  so be a good boy  good for you Ken  thanks Ken  I appreciate it  it's good to hear stories  like that man  and everybody out there  can't just kind of bring  push through man  you make it  alright Ken  thanks buddy  hey Ope  you know what I did realize  and Ken could probably  attest to this 
[02:15:00]  you grew up a lot faster  mentally  like  I remember  crying in front of the mirror  no one hated me  just fucking  looking at myself  crying  going  I deserve a better childhood  I'm growing up too fast  because I know  what's going on  right now  shouldn't be happening to me  what is it going to take  to get you to cry today  because that would be great radio  tough guy like you  Puerto Rican guy like you  you break down and cry  my eyes were watery before  I know  I almost had you  I was working it too man  until you said something  what did I say  I made some dumb joke 
[02:15:30]  right  instead of keep going  your eyes are watery  or some shit like that  and that was it  you never acknowledged it  you acknowledged it  and that's what  fucking  put you on  god damn it  damn it  I almost had him  what's it going to take  today  when was the last time  your mom hit you  shit I can't remember  that far  a long time ago  yeah buddy  I wasn't molested  at all  alright  and you know  the funny thing  about all this  I don't ever think 
[02:16:00]  of it as child abuse  why  I don't know  is that weird  well now you do  don't you  I think that  yeah  to a certain extent  anything you want to do  to your own child  that's child abuse  you know  the reason  things you know  happen to you  that you wouldn't do  to your own kid  probably that means  that's child abuse  okay I was thinking  of it because  she was using it  as a corporate punishment  just punishment  that's what I deserve  plus no one wants  to see themselves  as an abused child  no one wants  to look at themselves  like I was that  kid that they talk about  I was douchey 
[02:16:30]  you just got beat up  I was douchey  by a woman  but you don't want  to see yourself  as like that  so you walked in the house  and she goes  we're fighting  yeah  well she let me  put my things down  and all that shit  and you guys  just have normal  conversations now  yeah  ah so fucking weird  but not because  of me man  I don't  if it was up to me  I would not even  deal with her at all  the ex-wife  I mean the wife  you know  she's just  she's a nice person  ah you're a good  person too Mars  yeah I'm sure 
[02:17:00]  she just doesn't  understand  kind of a sellout  but a nice person  why a nice sellout  you know the Puerto Rican  thing you're kind of  giving up  and whitened up  I don't understand  you can punch him  no  ah people are asking  why haven't you  called Mars' mom yet  that's up to you  I don't know Spanish  though  she doesn't understand  the language  and she'll play it off  like she doesn't  understand what's going on  totally  because I'm sure  she understands a lot  but she won't be  good radio  nah  well I do it in Spanish  someone will get it  have a five minute 
[02:17:30]  conversation with your mom  about this  but you know  I don't  I don't know  how to speak Spanish  so we're gonna have to  find somebody  that's great  he's not good at it  I'm not good at it  he's forgotten it  you have a mom  that doesn't read  that's another thing  wait how do you  communicate with your mom  if she doesn't know English  and you don't know Spanish  I speak Spanish  but it's broken  it's dirty Spanish  that's another thing  she watches all these  fucking telenovelas  where they speak  great Spanish  high Spanish  and she always gives me  the junk dialect 
[02:18:00]  you know  I mean we fuck up  so many words in Spanish  it's incredible  when I speak to another person  South American  they're like  what the fuck is that  some of that street  dirty Spanish  right  and you can't even say  it's Puerto Rican  because you have  Puerto Ricans that are  very well educated  listen to me  and they go  dude you're not speaking  you know  like Puerto Rican speak  it's just fucked up  alright  thank you Marsh  you're welcome  sorry  that was great  what do you mean sorry  you stepped up to the plate today  well I literally 
[02:18:30]  you know  I put the show  in a fucking somber mood  the words have yet to come  this is so  fucked up man  this is ONA's  worst of 2013  so far  on the OPN Anthony channel  yeah  this is OPN Anthony's  worst of 2013  so far  what's up Roddy  hey buddy  did you get the red carpet  treatment  oh yeah  I told Mars  to roll out the red carpet today  well  since he's abused 
[02:19:00]  it's hard  it's red with his beaten blood  I told him  I go man  a lot of people  related to you  yesterday Mars  because brah  I didn't even realize  I was abused  until I saw your eyes  I'm like how do you not  realize you're being abused  when you take a hot oil  spatula to your hands  but he learned  he learned  he didn't steal anymore  he did learn  yeah  mean but effective  the only thing that  that takes Mars back now  is if he hears Spanish  if anyone yells in Spanish 
[02:19:30]  he just starts crying  well  it now makes sense though  because over the years  you know  we've needed the Spanish guy  every once in a while  to translate something  maybe say something  and every time he tries  on our show  people call up and go  he doesn't know  how to speak Spanish  he speaks baby Spanish  he speaks baby Spanish  but now we know why  it sets his mom off  because she only knows Spanish  I had a buddy  in Florida  that I thought  spoke Spanish  but when other  Spanish people  they would tell me later 
[02:20:00]  and he was like a big dude  they would say  he talks like a toddler  like a little kid  but to me  it sounded like perfect  it sounded great  yeah but it's  because shit like  their grandparents  or whatever said to them  and then they got to school  and that part of them  never improved  and they need a hot spatula  in the back  yeah right  in the back of the hands  I don't know if that's abuse  do you really think  a hot oiled spatula  I mean no one's ever died  from a hot oiled spatula  let's do it then  I want E-Rock to do it  E-Rock 
[02:20:30]  we'll get a hot plate  what do you think  for Ronnie B  and the eye bag  oh we'll put this right up  no shit  it's going to be perfect for you  come on let's do it  for the eye bag  it's a super weak  okay  no you'll get a couple  like drops of oil  that might burn  a little more than  the spatula itself  the great pictures  he's thinking about it  E-Rock  here's the thing  he's thinking about it  you know we leave here today  we're heading to New Orleans  to be part of Radio Row  and we want to show  those other  wait what  what's going on  yeah we're all going 
[02:21:00]  the whole station  we're going to be in Radio Row  what really  and 150 other radio shows  all lined up  that's my dream  we're really going  that's my dream  have you ever done Radio Row before  yes I have  it's the worst  we stopped doing Radio Row  about  I don't know  at least  I don't know  12 years ago  easy  it was really hard  when me and Ann  first started doing radio together  we had to do a few Radio Rows  I remember we were supposed to do one  and then we got kicked off the air  we were supposed to do one in Boston  for Jim Cook 
[02:21:30]  and I was so excited  because Gene Simmons  was going to be there  but then we never wound up going on  because we got booted off  you know what  that was the last time  we did Radio Row  we did the Sam Adams Brewery  oh yeah  with a whole bunch of other radio guys  the thing is  is like you see Gene Simmons  with everybody  before he gets to him  and by the time he gets here  you just feel like shit  yeah  what else does he have for us  and then there's a lot of things  where they promise Gene Simmons  but then you get to talk to a roadie  and like  I don't know what's with Gene  he should be here  right 
[02:22:00]  it's fucking terrible  they said we were going to go to the Super Bowl  this year again  and there's nothing  don't  it's awful  it's the principle though Ronnie  no no no  at least once  have you ever gone to the Super Bowl  as a radio show  yeah  it's fucking awful  yeah but I want to go once  I've never gone  don't do it  I've been at this radio thing  since I was 18  I want to go once  go for real  and fucking just go to the Super Bowl  and SoundCloud it  yeah  but don't fucking  show up  and like  Jim Nance is running late 
[02:22:30]  and there's  800 shows here  to make it feel like  you're just nobody  of course  you know  it's like the DMV  of fucking radio  and then you start  interviewing janitors  and like  yeah  kind of old cheerleaders  anyone you can find  I did one at Disney  where they kept running  voices by us  you know  so like  this is the voice  of whoever  what fucking cartoon character  right  and then he would try  to talk that way  and then I would try  to like say  so when did you start  doing voices  and he wouldn't  break character  oh Christ 
[02:23:00]  I'm like  come on  people at home  know you're not  a fucking cartoon  exactly  E-Rock  spatula  hot oil  I gotta think about that  we slap both hands  how about we slap one hand  we slap the one hand  you don't need  did it happen to Mars  every time  the same way  or  just once  just once  and that's not abuse  you've had some shit  happen to you  growing up Ronnie  everybody got hit  right  of course  it's our generation  yeah so why would  they now turn around  and call it abuse  if everybody got it  see I don't know  you're the greatest 
[02:23:30]  corny  I don't even know  if you're  fucking with us  I mean  a hot spatula  just because everyone  was a slave  in the 1790s  doesn't mean  it's no longer slavery  yeah but nobody  knew not to  so you can't break  the balls of the people  at the time  oh look  there's a YouTube videos  of guys getting  hit in the butt  with spatulas  that's a little different  this was heated though  yeah  but his mom was cooking  it's not like she  sat it on a pan  right  let's bring him in  I don't care  I mean  I almost had him crying  but I failed  because I pointed out 
[02:24:00]  that he was almost crying  and that made him  uber aware  here's what  I blew it  here's what you say  instead of crying  you just say  I noticed that your eyes  I said that  there's some water in your eyes  that's what I thought  would work  that should have worked  yeah  okay so I didn't blow  because that's exactly  what I said  well you just be comforting  just be comforting  like you know  I know it's rough  but it's going to be alright  and then all of a sudden  they feel relaxed  and then they cry  and then you call them  here comes Mars  and then he tells me  this morning  he goes  brah  I got so many more stories  I'm like  what were you waiting for  yesterday was the 
[02:24:30]  let's make everyone sad  because Mars had a shitty live show  hi buddy  how are you  how are you feeling today  pretty good  you know  I tried to relate to you  a little bit  when I came in  and you didn't really want to talk  about yesterday's appearance  I noticed  I didn't know what to make of it  this morning  talking to you  so I just wanted to leave it alone  I even held the door  a little longer  than I usually do  thinking you would follow me in  it was awkward  I know  I didn't know if I were to say  what's wrong with you  to say thank you  or whatever  but I'm really nervous now  why 
[02:25:00]  because Ronnie's in  because Ronnie's in  and Ronnie fucking pulls shit out of people  that's not true  yes you do sir  you're the best  just relax  you're like an interrogator  no you're all dressed in camouflage  like anything happens  you go into the bushes  we can't even see you Mars  and he says you speak baby Spanish  I do  which I think is hilarious  he's absolutely right  yeah  why don't you speak the language  if your mom only speaks Spanish  like I said  it tore up  I speak it tore up  but how do you have a mom  or father  that you can't really 
[02:25:30]  like communicate with  that's strange  to me  my earlier days  yeah  I spoke better  and as I grew up  and grew distant from them  I didn't use the language  yeah but you probably never  talked to your mom  on more of a  higher I should say  than a third grade level  yeah  absolutely right  your entire life  absolutely right  that's weird  that's all she's got  is there a lot of  no I'm thinking  that's all you got  as far as Spanish goes  that's all she's got  trust me  it's her  it's her  she's  wow she  okay  alright  I got you  alright  so what do you do 
[02:26:00]  most of the time  you're pointing at things  some English words  some point  you guys must enjoy  a nice episode  of Dora the Explorer  that must be your show  huh  I like Dora  as far as he comes home  during Sesame Street  his mom's like  shh  working on apps  right now  so uh  was the spatula  one time  that was just  one time deal  that's why she was cooking  right  no she wasn't cooking  she set it up 
[02:26:30]  she set the heat to it  that's fucking  that means she knows  that's psychotic  you must have been awful  no was it  no  I was not  not deserving  something like that  anyway  I was mischievous  yeah  I was uh  you know  I was an altar boy  well I was one of those  altar boys and choir boys  that uh  a priest  yeah  drinking the wine  eating the fucking hosts  and  which is really  that's a mortal sin  I mean  seriously  I was hungry  yeah but that's the worst  thing you could do  before they were blessed 
[02:27:00]  you're gonna burn  as soon as they come out  the box  no  I was a good altar boy  because I would do it  as soon as they came out  of the box  as opposed  exactly  how hungry are you  that you're eating that crap  it's great  no they don't  yes they do  everyone's  no  there's absolutely no taste  they taste like  fucking uncooked bread  no they're not  I like the way they taste  no it's horrendous  and just  remember how it just lay  in your mouth  and it just kind of  it disappeared  it dissolves  so how does that taste  it's good  it's like a packing peanut  they're disgusting  it's a bracking peanut  it's a breath strip 
[02:27:30]  I love it  without the flavor  I loved them  did you have a priest  yes well that's the thing  I was getting at  well  wow look at him  look at Ronnie  slow it down  Ronnie look at him jumping  no  I didn't even ask the question  what I was getting at  is because of the way I was  priests would not  you know  attempt anything  you know  they don't  they like the docile kids  the kids that do  whatever they're told  not motherfuckers like me  ugly  did you know kids  you wanted it though 
[02:28:00]  no I did not  what  no  oh  no  what  so yeah  but what  but  did you know that other kids  were getting molested  no not in my school  my entourage was also  a bunch of misfits  you know  right  so you were a problem child  no  I was getting the real story  he's one of the Jets  his mama was going to put up with that  she smacked him with a hot spatula  oh man  this is a different story today  no  you were a problem child  no I was  I was  you know  were you one of those guys  on the screen 
[02:28:30]  you know  you remember back in the day  I don't know if you had this game  in Long Island  but we used to have this game  in Washington Heights  called Scully  Scully  what Scully  and you would take  back in the day  the wooden chairs  they would have  on the legs  metal caps  remember those  I think we still  they still have  on the bottom  right  we would take the chairs  and pop them off  take the metal cap  take the rubber off  out of them  the metal  we would fill it with crayon  and on the street itself 
[02:29:00]  we were  the game Scully  would be  a bunch of little boxes  very poor  really  poor  you guys never seen this game  what did you do  okay  so it would be  boxes  they were numbered  in different locations  it was 1 through 13  13 being in the middle  in mud  so it was a small square  so you would go  1  2  3  4  and as you're doing it  the guy that's playing with you  you would knock him out of whack  you know  you knock him out of the place  take his place  things like that  guys never play that  no  it sounds great  it was fun 
[02:29:30]  it was fucking fun  so we would  I would do things like that  I would steal the caps  from the chairs  you couldn't find like  just bottle caps  it seemed like it would have  worked with bottle caps  it worked with the milk  milk caps  the milk caps  alright so get some milk caps  the metal caps were better  because if I hit you  with a metal cap  and you had a plastic shit  I would send your shit away  like boom  gone  man you grew up  in the early 50s  damn  this is like  we did something similar  our parents used to buy us toys  yeah exactly 
[02:30:00]  we played with them  yeah  they would take us to  Toys R Us  with a gift card  but that type of stealing  I would do  you know  fights  I would get into fights  so you deserved  what your mom gave you  I mean you gave her  a rough time  you know what I mean  you were hard on that woman  no it was not hard on that woman  I guess  I guess like  we spoke yesterday  I reminded her of  her husband  wait you spoke to her yesterday  no you're saying  as he said  oh okay  I thought there was  a little conversation  after your appearance  your dad used to steal  the caps on chairs too  that's mean 
[02:30:30]  that's seriously mean  I don't understand  why you're fucking up  good chairs  that's so weird  yeah so  shit like that  so  that's all I would do  did you hear that  but you look like  your dad  so she hated you for it  yeah I think that  these guys hit the nail  on the head  I look a lot like him  I also have an attitude  like him  so  yeah she does  get out on you  did you hear  did you hear the story  where he came home  from school  and his mom was  waiting for him  and said  we're fighting today  she actually put her hands up  and I squared off 
[02:31:00]  but it's weird with him  like  he stayed  he does martial arts  oh yeah  every night  he's just thinking  I have to defend myself  I can't be humiliated  of course  you know  I've got to be able  to stand up  I'm not  you know  you're trying to protect that  I can't inside you  yeah when was the last time  you got  someone got the best of you  yesterday  about 4 o'clock  what  you said the best of me  right  yeah I was training yesterday  with someone  no I don't mean that  because you're in a whole different world  than the average person  I mean just 
[02:31:30]  when did someone take  your scully caps  when was the last time  the last time  I had a good fist fight  was at 21  and since then  no one has really  been able to fuck with you  every day you're ready  that's what I mean  unfortunately  you know  you train  and you think  that it's coming  and it never comes  not that I wanted to come  oh you wanted to come  you wanted to come  you want a good excuse  you want to be attacked  one day  by an older Puerto Rican  with a spatula  yeah I'll fuck her up  I'm not little anymore 
[02:32:00]  holy fuck  she's just  she's just coming out  of Sonoma  with a stupid spatula  I feel bad for her  but you know  a lot of people  bring up the abuse thing  yeah  our whole generation  got hit  did you ever feel  like you were abused  or any of your friends  were abused  not really  no we got the wooden spoons  and the sticks  yet we had to go outside  and get our own stick  every once in a while  see that would be abuse  they would come in  and arrest those people  today  yeah I came in  with a small stick 
[02:32:30]  and then they would laugh  and I would diffuse  the situation a little bit  see Ronnie  honestly  I had no idea  that that was abuse  all these years  I'm fucking 47 man  and as I'm talking  to the guys yesterday  and looking at their eyes  and their reactions  right  this is the first time  I really you know  now you know  I spoke about it  before  plenty of times  I'm good with it  but seeing these guys  reaction  I was like holy shit  you didn't know  that you were such a victim  yeah  I thought that's the way it was  what gave it away  was it the tents 
[02:33:00]  in our pants  I'm sorry  I think you knew  maybe  and maybe  that shit was buried  until yesterday  regressed it  but I mean  the other part of it  is you know  that you weren't loved  that's the thing  oh yeah  you know  that everyone else  see that's the shit man  she did a lot of  other fucking shit  that showed love  like you know  being able to  put me through  parochial school  you know  all these years  that's obligation  that's not love  that's obligation  well she would do something  and remember this  I didn't bring this up  putting you through  just regular school  right like the other kids 
[02:33:30]  what are you talking about  what do you mean  Catholic school  yeah but parents  are just supposed to do that  well they could send me  to public school  well you probably  would have been better off  less molested  no no no no  I think Catholic school  did a lot for me bro  alright  gave you a little discipline  yeah  taught you to be quiet  didn't steal anymore  it taught me how to  what happened to my fucking head  you're the guy  and not be distracted  exactly  we can't call anyone  you're the guy  you've got to figure it out  taught you to take your medicine  it's amazing  that somebody  who committed mortal sins 
[02:34:00]  of drinking the blood of Christ  as if it was a cocktail  and I was like  oh thank God  for Catholic school  yeah exactly  so much  I had a priest  they used to say  god damn  he used to curse  yeah  he used to curse  it was fun  aren't those the hip guys  the what guys  the hip guys  I like priests like that  yeah he was cool  yeah  he was cool  you said you had other stories  yeah  it was a world without love  it took me  wait  it took me nine years  to put this shit on air 
[02:34:30]  slow it down  you were the one  excitedly telling me  this morning  I got other stories  I've seen some shit  man  give us one  a good story  in reference to  my mother  I remember  see like  gay people in my family  and all that shit  that was  that was a common thing  like it was not a big deal  for example  we would go visit  Titi  and Titi had  Wonder Woman  over there  and Wonder Woman  was a nickname  of one of the individuals 
[02:35:00]  I used to hang out with her  and it was  Tranny  so we were used to that  kind of stuff  you know  we grew up with that  Wonder Woman  yeah  his name was Wonder Woman  he used to spin around  like Wonder Woman  his dick was just turning  it was like fucking  helicopter cock  I remember this shit  as a kid  for sure  he was the king  of the meatspan  covered in jizz  just like  oh Wonder Woman  what a fun game  he put his cock  in an invisible condom  and violate you  Wonder Woman 
[02:35:30]  yeah  he was hanging out  with Wonder Woman  um  they didn't show that  Wonder Woman would come around  by herself  or by itself  was she related to yourself  by itself  personal  was she related  oh he  I don't know  family friend  family friend  but then  how was she associated  with your family  I don't know  it was my aunt  I used to go visit her  in the Bronx  and he used to be there  hanging out  I guess  they used to smoke weed  do something together  I don't know  PC pig  gay people that have  good connections with drugs  so what happened 
[02:36:00]  did Wonder Woman  fumble with you  no no  that was just  like growing up  I was used to seeing  shit like that  it wasn't  when I see a tranny  or hear a tranny sex  it was  no big deal  what kind of sex  did you see  not see  but I heard  I heard a lot of  you heard sex  you know  I used to go  I used to go visit  my aunt right  in the Bronx  I used to go into  the rooms in the mornings  and she also had  that fucking piss pot  oh you heard about  the piss pot right  yeah  was your aunt  the sister of your mother 
[02:36:30]  yes  see  there was something  going on with that  father at night  I bet you that  they didn't like  to leave the bedroom  at night  because why would  both of them  get into this habit  of pissing in this  fucking thing  without  one I could see  being a lazy  you know what  but I mean  I don't understand  why too  hold on  for the people  that weren't  listening yesterday  your mom would  piss into some  kind of bedpan thing  instead of getting up  and going 20 feet  to the bathroom  in the middle of the night  and now we're learning  the sister did the same thing  right  now I know  who has Wonder Woman  as a friend  right  and there was three 
[02:37:00]  did Wonder Woman  live with her  no no  Wonder Woman just visit  all right  you know  and I know  of three aunts  that do that  the piss pot  all same  wait three aunts  and your mom  so that would be four  no three all together  it's my mom  and two aunts  so there's three  girls all together  that do the piss pot thing  what the fuck  is that about Ronnie  I don't know  probably they grew up  in some fucking  dirt shack  down in Puerto Rico  with no bathroom  and everything  probably had an outhouse  yeah  maybe instead of  going outside  to an outhouse  where the wild dogs are 
[02:37:30]  yeah  oh you know what  there you go  why wouldn't you go  fuck that  I got a nice bathroom now  that's a bunch of bullshit  because there was an apartment  in Puerto Rico  you're telling Ronnie  that's a bunch of bullshit  no I'm just letting  I'm saying like  if that would be an excuse  for my mother  it's a bunch of bullshit  because they had an apartment  where in Puerto Rico  yeah they didn't have an outhouse  they lived on the second  or third floor  and there was  bathroom on the first floor  on the same floor  you know  in the apartment  but probably all clogged up  with fucking shit  yeah  maybe you're onto something there 
[02:38:00]  Jimmy  that they were afraid  to go to the bathroom  maybe they'd sneak out  and when they went out  to the kitchen  or whatever  in the bathroom  he'd be fucking drunk  in the living room  come in here  come in here  his dad was drunk  all the time  yeah  he was  he was  Afro-Cuban  he came from  fighting father  with the Cuban  we got it  he came  no because actually  I'm Puerto Rican  Afro-Cuban  yeah right  yeah he came over  to Puerto Rico  and he started  a big family  he was ten kids  he was the barber  of the town  everybody knew him 
[02:38:30]  but he was also  he was with your aunt  and your mom  he was with them both  he was like the fucking  cock of the walk there  anybody that was in that  house was gonna get banged  oh yeah  well I don't know  about bang  but they would get  she would tell me stories  that he used to  hit them with the strap  the strap to  their father  sharpen your razor  yeah  yeah so  getting hit with that  was pretty rough too  so I guess  an extension cord to her  because I keep bringing  that shit up  because that  when I felt that  extension cord  I remember to this day 
[02:39:00]  I couldn't breathe  the pain was so much  yeah that's rough  yeah  dude let me  an extension cord is rough  and I understand  a wooden spoon  or that other shit  but that's abuse  no  even for that generation  look at Ronnie  see he's not phased  he's not phased  I just feel like  you can  you know  you're judging  outside of the era  that it took place in  you know  that back then  extension cord though  it's the same as  that's a whip  same as a belt  is it the same as a belt 
[02:39:30]  dude it's two different things  I would love to get hit by a belt  as opposed to being a belt  sure  alright well  I think I got a belt  you said you're fucking  so high there  I'd love to get hit by a belt  Iraq would you get hit  by a belt  and an extension cord  so we can see if it's different  oh I don't want  you haven't done anything  for the show lately  can I tell you something  Troy is texting  yeah  saying Iraq is a pussy  and he will get hit  with a hot spatula  no he shouldn't do that shit  Troy is the fucking real deal  man  where is Troy 
[02:40:00]  is he here yet  he's here  he's here  let's bring Troy in  let's get the hot plate  before fucking  the radio wizard  shuts us down  do you like being spanked  by girls or no  no hell no  I don't like that shit  any rough stuff  tying me down  fuck no  don't like it  oh yeah  I'm losing my mind bro  here's Troy Kwonk  yeah I'll do it  he rocks a pussy  it's a hot spatula  in oil  and then we take it out  of the fucking hot oil  and whack your hands  just smack me on my hand  yeah  that's easy right  yeah  let's do it  did your mom just 
[02:40:30]  let it sit there  Morris how did it go down  that shit was hot  it was you know  and the grease  did she just hit it  yeah she just hit it  but the grease is important  because the grease  is what stayed on his hand  and burned  you dip it in grease  alright we got a hot plate  around this joint or what  get some grease  get some grease  grease  that's easy to get  do you think an extension cord  is worse than a belt  if you got hit by that  well a belt  has a bigger surface  that's what I'm thinking  but a cord might have  more of a whip  type of an effect on it 
[02:41:00]  there's no doubt  that the cord  an extension cord  is a motherfucker  there's metal running  through the extension cord  did you get hit with the end of it  or is it just like  they hold it like a belt would  just like a belt  oh that's a motherfucker  it's gonna come down faster  yeah  did it leave a mark  did it leave the big  long line across  it left a big long line  can you show it to your friends  do you have any scars  I showed you yesterday  the only scar I could come up with  I didn't see any scars  what did you show me  I don't remember  his scars are inside  deep inside  my hair is on my hand  oh right right  they don't grow 
[02:41:30]  he can't grow  so yeah  did you ever  we shouldn't  hey do you ever  bring it up to your mind now  uh no  I have in the past  and they act like  you know  oh well that was Dan  I was stupid  I was ignorant  you know so it's kind of  oh there's a low acknowledgement  what are you gonna do  sometimes there's no acknowledgement  yeah but they  I mean no  what would you like her to say  nothing  but I'm saying  if you talked about  how would you like her to react  what would be  what would be a reaction  where you went  okay she kind of gets it  to stop being a fucking cunt now 
[02:42:00]  and just you know  be there for the  I don't want her around  nothing  I want nothing  good for you  Mars  I really don't  yeah stop with that shit  stop with that  wishing that she's gonna change  the reality is  no one ever changes  no  no one ever changes  they don't  but then it's  it's up to you  whether you accept that  exactly  that's the fucking thing  that I don't understand  like people are like  oh I hit my parents  I'm going over there  this weekend  yeah  why would you  why would you go  to an unpleasant place  you don't put up with it  with anyone else 
[02:42:30]  no  the only  the only reason  like I said yesterday  I put up with it now  is cause I have a lovely wife  that wants to have  all the grandparents  she wants the perfect family  that's a lie  well she's living a lie  she's getting  she's getting  yesterday I told her  about what happened here  and she was like  dude you  really man  if you feel that way  we don't have to  have a run  too late  you know  it's not  it took this show  for her to realize  right  she's a nice person  but seriously  the thing is  is like  Opie went across  for you the way  your wife should have  okay  that's the thing  you gotta let into your head 
[02:43:00]  okay  every fucking night  when you're laying next to her  you know what I mean  like she's asking you  swallow some shit  so we can feel like  we're a real family  instead of the truth  you got a real family  it's not  you know  that's what I said  that's what I said  it's a real radio family  that's what I said  but you got a real family  don't worry about making  your familia  it seems like you're  a grounded father  and you got a good woman  and you got good kids  that's all you need  you don't  because if you bring her around  then there's gonna be  that darkness  and that  everyone's tense 
[02:43:30]  you don't need that shit  and your kids pick up on that  and granted  you know  she's getting older  trying to get to the pearly gates  so she's fucking  too late  but she's trying to do the right thing  like when she does have my kids  what do you mean she's doing the right thing  has she removed all spatulas from our house  stop pissing in front of the kids  how about we start there  how about we get rid of the bedpan and the spatulas  has she stopped tankling into a chock full of nuts can  right  and how about she puts down her fists  start there  and get rid of that old fucking stereo system 
[02:44:00]  seems to be a fucking hazard in her house  parrots flying around  lizards on the wall  someone throws a quarter off the fucking cruise ship  the whole family's diving in  as fast as they can  I'm glad we were able to make the jokes today  because yesterday was a little intense  we got some jokes in  but  did you hear his head got  kind of got stuck in the  oh yeah  you remember  I was describing that big stereo  back in the 70s  two big speakers on either end 
[02:44:30]  there was in the middle  the turntable radio  and then next to that big television  so that big whole stereo system  when she knocked me down  you know  I'm young  I don't know  I go in  with my head turned to the side  and she's mounting me  so I look at her  so now I turn my head upright  and I wedge my head  underneath the stereo system  not knowing that I could turn it back the other way  I'm fucking nervous  this bitch is trying to kill me  you know  and she's looking at me  and then she's actually  Sam asked like 
[02:45:00]  how was she hitting me  she was punching me in the face  and smiling  and going  and like with every hit  was like  huh  like uh-huh  how about that  she's digging  yeah  she hated your father  she's just bullying you  you might want to listen to Pearl Jam's Alive  yeah  it's a whole song about that shit  listen to that whole  don't call me daughter bullshit  yeah  yeah  you're like  Pearl Jam's all about family abuse  you might want to go into their catalog  a little bit  I like Pearl Jam  go listen to Alive  imagine  you should wear shorts  wherever you go now  Troy you ever get hit 
[02:45:30]  is this no big deal to you  I got hit as a kid  I mean nothing like that  oh so you acknowledge that Mars had a rough huh  oh yeah  yeah he had a bad  but it's like um  I guess it's like a Hispanic thing  I mean they just  they're just racist  they're crazy  yeah that's horrible  yeah she threw a  I know we all  maybe not Sam  maybe you  maybe she threw something at you  your parents maybe  right exactly  my mom was about  throwing my whole room out  on the driveway  but thank God  she didn't throw anything  did that mean you had to leave  like you're supposed to leave now  no I was supposed to clean my room 
[02:46:00]  oh great  yeah  did it work  if I left shoes out  it would be the dumbest  stupidest thing  so instead of saying  hey why don't you put  your shoes in the closet  no the whole room  had to be in the  on the driveway  yeah  why do they care about your room  I never understood that  because if the door is closed  who cares  but uh  she uh  back in the day  in the 70s  she threw a  hairbrush at me  and the plastic back then  was not like the plastic  we have now  a little lightweight  plastic back then  was fucking sturdy 
[02:46:30]  you know  plastic today  will do some damage  okay  the bitch throws it  she misses me  you know  back then we didn't have  sheet rock  we had uh  plaster  she made a fucking hole  you see the plaster  coming off  you know  I didn't think anything of it  I thought hey  she missed you know  right  but now as I'm speaking  to you guys  I'm like you know  if she would have hit me  with that shit  she would have fucking  probably really caused  some serious damage  you think she hated you  most  yeah I think so  yeah  that's the part that hurts  I still think she hates me  yeah  she does  she has a problem with me 
[02:47:00]  do you get any love  from the older people  in your family  like an aunt  an uncle  those people  yeah yeah yeah  crazy love  I had a grandma  that was amazing  you know  I have an uncle  that gives me so much love  that I think that he knows  the things that have occurred  you know  so that's kind of cool  well why wasn't he there  to fucking save you  that's the thing  because it's in his house  yeah but the thing is  if he could  you know what I mean  like today  if you found out  some neighbor kid  was getting abused  you'd go over  where were these people  for you  that's the part that hurts  despite all the  the nice things 
[02:47:30]  that are being said  that's why  that's that thing inside you  you'll never be able  to take care of  yeah they thought  it was the thing to do  back then I guess  you know  I really  I'm good with it  you're not good  yes I am  you're fidgeting  in your pockets  you're not good  you know what I mean  it's okay  this is a fucking safe place  I've passed  try to keep your hands still  for a minute  they won't believe  that you're good with it  you're good with it  the way Ving Rhames  was good with it  when Bruce Willis  came back in  is this Armageddon?  I don't know  we're in a couple films together 
[02:48:00]  no this was the  ass fuck  sheriff  and Mars is asking  for music  for a segment  you want your segment  produced  no no  how about the Hulk music  why don't you play some music  you rock instead  just sitting in there  fucking gaining weight  I guess we're not doing  the spatula thing  what happened to this show  I don't know  we would have had a fucking  hot plate fired up by now  nobody takes you seriously  at your word  no no that's not it  lawyers  we're looking out for  they're not up yet  no yeah lawyers  are just sleeping  give the fuck 
[02:48:30]  first hour  is the wild wild west  first hour  we do whatever the fuck  right  they're still sleeping  you got 15 minutes to burn  that's right  why do you want to be burned?  no why not  I'm just tired of people  not stepping up around here  right  you know what I mean  Troy comes to fucking  said comes to work  Troy put a strawberry  up his ass  what's that noise?  what is that?  it's your phone or something  oh  Mars vibrate  what's going on?  that's a water sound  your phone?  yeah  oh man are you trying  to keep calm  yeah right  that's it  even the phone sets them off 
[02:49:00]  yes  it's sad  what was that?  that's what a relative  calls  the sound of just  the fuck  over the water  was that a wave?  you hear the sea  and then you hear  the ship off shore  go  yeah you want to leave  is that  no it reminds them  of this whole family  holding onto a door  who's calling you?  it was one of the guys  in the shop  don't they know  you're busy  you're being a big  radio star right now  that shit could wait  what do they want?  what do they want? 
[02:49:30]  I don't know  they were looking for  some nuts and bolts  or something  probably  there you go  see Sirius is calling me now  let it go  alright listen  so Troy's tired  he's not stepping up  Troy stuck a chocolate  covered strawberry  up his ass  and Sal grabbed it  without his hands  that's the type of program  we're giving people  these days  well you bring it back  the shock jock thing  which I really appreciate  we're trying to bring  back the shock jock  it's retro now  try to have some fun  around here  I know you want to  do it in the studio  but that probably  leaves a mark  and will probably  have legal issues 
[02:50:00]  why are you saying that?  you know what  Troy's not going to sue  there's no legal issues  don't give a shit  I like the other one better  remember when I told you  when she smacked me  in the bitter cold  that's a good one  that's a rough one  that's a rough one man  being slapped in the face  in the cold stinks  so what  we have to hang outside  in the cold for a while  it's not cold out today  can our hands cold?  it's like 40 today  I think  and who would slap Troy?  it's nice out there  way to not bring this up 
[02:50:30]  the last three days  when we were freezing  our asses off  he wasted its  balmy in New York  what are we going to do?  where's that half plate?  where's the grease?  do we even have one?  I don't even know  you have to go buy one  or maybe we can microwave  some fucking oil  or something  pour it on your head  Martha Stewart's studio  but your mother made you  a better parent  right Mars?  I'm sorry?  your mom made you  a better parent  because you'll never  do shit like that  you'll never even  probably hit your kids  yeah absolutely  well that's an  interesting question  Jim Norton  because then he might  be going too far 
[02:51:00]  the other way  oh let the kids  get away  now  now you're talking  that's sort of  what I was talking  to Jimmy about  on the way home  when you are brought  up in a household  that's a little strange  you know  you could go  you could do  the exact same shit  or you could go  the complete opposite way  where they're just  wild kids  no they're not wild  but they'll walk over  daddy  they will right  they'll get over  see nobody  respected you  nah  generation before  generation beneath  no they  they understand  the respect  they do respect me  but you know  they'll get  they'll get 
[02:51:30]  you know  you do the timeouts  that shit don't work  but I have to do  my kid mocks me  and he goes  over here  like he'll point  to places  where he's supposed  to sit  I'm like  are you kidding  you know what  happened to us  when we didn't behave  you know what works  and then he sits  there mocking us  yeah sure  of course  why wouldn't he  so then we like  take his chair  and we try to put  it in like  maybe a boring room  that's the best  we can do  does he have  electronics  what do you want  leaf frogs  and things like that  you want  to electrocute  my kid  get him in a tub  with that stuff  you know  the leap pads  you know 
[02:52:00]  what kind of  sick fucking  thought you got  now  look it up man  I know leap frog  what are you getting at  Tetris  you take that  away from them  I know my son  he's seven man  all I have to do  is talk about  I'm removing your  DS  yeah but what about  these people  in the fucking  like you ever see  these little kids  in a restaurant  where they're  just screaming  to fuck it up  and their parents  are like this  Wallace  Wallace  Wallace  it doesn't  happen to me  I'm like  I've actually  sat in restaurants  that go like this  hey Wallace  I'm not fucking  around with you  sit the fuck down 
[02:52:30]  because I'm not  your parents  because I can't  I don't understand  why people let  themselves get  abused like this  you're not an  equal with those  no no  okay you know  what works  actually works  when my kid  acts up  I'm mortified  I get him  out of the  situation  I get so  uncomfortable  that I'm  bothering other  people  but if your  tonality changes  the kid  has got to  respect that  the kid has got to  say my old man's  kind of crazy  that's it right there  that's exactly what  I do  I could use  more of a stern voice  and he'll calm down  I've realized that 
[02:53:00]  so far  dude you grab him  by the bicep  put a little squeeze  and look at him  in your eyes  I will fucking kill you  I don't do anything  make him drink out of  that coffee can  squeeze his little  bicep  he's got thumbprint 
[02:53:30]  bruises all over his  arms  that's what they do  that's the  Puerto Rican way  what do you do  really  you just squeeze  his arm over  it's all in there  it's 15 years  Mars Jr. is going  to be on a radio  show telling stories  and you're going  to be like  I don't understand  why are you so  upset about it  he's dressed in  camouflage  now all I have  to do is change  my tone  and the eyes  and that's it  it's good enough  oh boy  how old are  these kids  I'm sorry  how old are they  5, 7, and 15 
[02:54:00]  what gang's  they run away  no gang's  I'm on top  of them boy  I'm on top  of them  just like your mom  was on top  of you  giving left  hugs  no  oh boy  it's gross  everyone's looking  down now  hey you got the  Puerto Rican flag  there  I don't know why  it's on this  either  what the alley  float like a  butterfly sweatshirt  that Jimmy's wearing  I don't know  it makes no sense  I have no  my ex saw it  and she goes  that's a hipster  sweatshirt  I'm like  really  she goes  yeah it's got a  Puerto Rican flag  I didn't even  notice it  makes no sense 
[02:54:30]  though  maybe it was  when he fought  did Ali ever  fight down there  in Puerto Rico  I'm sure he did  I don't think so  either  I don't think so  he might have  trained at one  point but  I don't think  that he ever had  did he have some  Puerto Rican blood  in him maybe  a little bit  that's probably  one of those  sweatshirts  they sent to  Africa  you know  they couldn't  sell here  but you got it  no I bought it  at a very hip  place  like where  oh  I think it was  Urban Outfitters  I was cold  really  wow that's weird  Mars do you abuse  your kids  no I do not  abuse my kids 
[02:55:00]  why are you squeezing  their arms  get on top of them  a little bit  no I don't get  on top of them  I'm  your words  me too  I like how nervous  he gets  this is great  oh  you alright  it's unchattered  unchattered waters  for me  unchattered waters  nobody's talking  about them  exactly  this is what you  say  it takes a lot  of bravery  to let this stuff out  to begin with  it takes a lot  of bravery  for you  just to  express this  like I said  it took nine years  to even bring it up 
[02:55:30]  and you're kind of  like an alpha male  too so this is  kind of cool  to see an alpha male  break down a little bit  that's why he's an alpha male  he needs to protect  he can't let it happen again  and that's why he's  always thinking  every day he's thinking  when is something bad  going to happen  now do you grow up  do you think that way  like oh something bad  going to happen  I don't think most people  do that  only from 6 to 10  yeah sure  anything could  I laugh at most of the  stuff that happens  around me  because of how I was  brought up I think  you just laugh it off  like  yeah I've seen a lot 
[02:56:00]  of shit  dumb shit  you know  mine was more like  mental abuse  a lot of screaming  and yelling  that's rough  that's rough too  what was weird about it  though  coming home and seeing  your room in the driveway  it's a little rough  right  why didn't you act  like oh this is  my room now  do you have to read  the comic book  under your lap  come on this is great  thanks  my thing was  I realized from an  early age  so I like avoided 
[02:56:30]  the house as much  as I could  I became a caddy  at 12  13  and I would  I would do two loops  a day easy  so I was there  when the sun rose  and I was there  as the sun was setting  man  did you do two bags  two bags  now I got the  herniated disc  to prove it  yeah that was a lot  of weight for a  13 year old  what kind of  fucking man  let a little kid  carry two fucking bags  it was disgusting  how did you feel  better about yourself  if you're a man  like hey grab  both those bags  and let's go  yeah and follow me  I was half the sizes 
[02:57:00]  of a lot of these  golfers at first  yeah  it was crazy  but I enjoyed it  I enjoyed the conversation  just being out of the  house and being on  the course  loved the sport  you know  that was my thing  to avoid  I had siblings  that confronted  I'm like  that was just stupid  and then I knew  at 18  let's go  let's do this  yeah  so  but in the back  of your mind  you're like  there was never  any comforting time  for you either  I mean  we talk about it  I mean  if two days went by 
[02:57:30]  without some kind  of drama in my house  that was huge  two  two days  barely  and that barely happened  there was always  some dumb issue  it was always  dumb shit  you know  she didn't raise  kids that were bad  you know  she had  seven kids in the house  and none of us  have any real  like  issues or problems  you know what I mean  that deserved anything  that was going down  it was always  dumb shit  like if we didn't  eat our meal  that would be a problem  if we didn't eat  everything on our plate  why do you think 
[02:58:00]  people get into  that thing  because they  like  it's like  they didn't plan  their life  and then they look  around  and there's all  these kids  well  that's a really  good question  in my situation  my mom  has openly  said this  which is kind  of fucked up  that she never  wanted all those  kids  she had  she had six  births  and then she  had my dad's  daughter from  another marriage  so seven kids  in the house  she was raised  catholic  so she did it  the catholic way  where you don't 
[02:58:30]  use birth control  and you have kids  she never wanted  seven kids  she tells us  wouldn't a mentally  ill person  have problems  even if there's  only two though  like the fact  is that they're  crazy so no matter  what the circumstances  they're gonna be  fucked up  but I think  certainly having  a lot of kids  helped it along  a little bit too  but yeah  she came from  a weird house  which I don't  know much about  because I don't  ask the questions  her mom was  a cunt  I will tell you  that much  my mom wasn't  as bad as  her mom  you know  her mom  sued her  for money 
[02:59:00]  that she borrowed  when you know  we had the six kids  and now we gotta  eat and pay  the bills  so my mom  took out a little  loan with her  own mother  and they weren't  paying her back  fast enough  and I remember  that my quote  I say quote  because she wasn't  my grandma  ended up  suing my mom  and went through  the whole court  system everything  lawyers and all  sorts of shit  fucked up right  right it's fucked up  and it was you know  they were in a bad  spot they needed  the money  and my dad  wasn't making  that much money  at the time  and they were  paying her back 
[02:59:30]  but not good  enough for her  and she didn't  even need  the fucking  money  and sued  her own mom  so my mom  my mom actually  did the right  thing  she got rid  of her own mom  early on in my life  said you know  this is a horrendous  influence for my  family so she  can't be around  so I went from  like I don't even  know I think  I was 12  maybe and then  the next time  I saw her  I was like 22  23 when she  was dying in the  hospital  the classic story  I tell on the air  where she looked  at me and went  oh precious  you got so  you know big 
[03:00:00]  and I just  looked at my  mom and said  I'll be in the  car do what  you gotta do  I gave her  nothing  I was like  whatever old  lady enjoy  wherever the  fuck you're  going  and that was  it so  but she  you know  she removed  her from her  own life  to protect  our kids  but then you  know my mom  did her own  shit  see that's the  thing that  brings it back  what is the  fucking hardcore  thing  is it mental  abuse  or is it  physical abuse  you know  because  we didn't  really get  the physical  stuff  right  so who  had it  worse  I had 
[03:00:30]  them both  I don't  know if I've  ever said  this on the  air  but my  step sister  she's my  sister but  for the sake  of the argument  she got  some of the  shit  the physical  shit  from your  mom  yeah and I  always wondered  why we  weren't getting  that  wow that's  fucked up  yeah weird  shit  yeah like  oatmeal over the  head crap  like fucking  mommy deer  shit  oh yeah  like way more  physical shit  with her  I was like  wow  is that  coming our  way  and it  never really  did not  to that  extent  but you  can't have 
[03:01:00]  physical  without mental  you can have  mental without  physical but  you can't have  physical without  some kind of  mental aspect  because you're  always afraid  absolutely  like if you're  walking in the  house and your  mother's a  fucking wacko  he's got the  same thing and  he's also worried  that she's gonna  punch him in the  face it's like  the same person  but you had  seven kids to  kind of spread it  over a little bit  yeah and I  always had the  feeling that my  mom uh  this came out  of therapy which  pumped down my  therapist but I  always had the  kill me which  you know made  it tough to  sleep at night  honestly think  that you might 
[03:01:30]  die oh yeah  yeah yeah yeah  yeah if the  circumstances were  right absolutely  absolutely yeah  because she she  would just fly off  the handle and  just do crazy  shit but I  don't really  remember physical  abuse I just  don't then I  wonder why you  were so afraid  that she would  kill you like  her mental abuse  was just so  fucking just a  lot of screaming  and yelling all  the time and  just like losing  her shit throwing  stuff like hiding  in the attic that  type of thing  she hid in the  attic oh yeah I 
[03:02:00]  found her in the  attic a couple times  just having like  mental breakdowns she  had mental breakdowns  a lot and then  would have to go  away for that so  yeah and that was  must have been nice  right when she went  away it was like  oh look I'm looking  to see if she's  calling in uh yeah  it was kind of nice  it was like a little  vacation and that's  what it was that's  how it was told to  us too you know oh  she's uh visiting a  relative she'd be  gone for a little  while and she did  the shock treatment  back in the day  wow when she did  the shock treatment  when she was  pregnant with my  sister what old 
[03:02:30]  school shock treatment  because now supposedly  they figure that  shit out a little  better American  horror shit huh  American horror  shit I don't know  that's why I want  to flew over the  cuckoo's nest as  brilliant as that  movie is as a little  you know that's a  little creepy for me  just saying the yeah  the crazies because  in the back of your  mind you're like does  it go down another  generation do I have  this somewhere oh  yeah fuck yeah it's  inside my kids  completely yeah  completely aware you  know my my wife  helped me with that  and then I you know  I've been in and 
[03:03:00]  out of therapy making  sure you know figuring  this shit out how'd  your wife help you  she just uh how did  she help me that's a  great question just uh  just being there for  me and talking about  the shit like she she  would acknowledge the  craziness going around  like this is pretty  fucking crazy right and  then we just you know  we'd start talking and  stuff especially when she  comes from kind of a  happy blue collar  family you know I  mean she would  probably tell you she  had her own issues  growing up but I I  kind of laugh at it  you know because of  the you know but 
[03:03:30]  that's not fair but  you know where I how I  grew up and how she  grew up I think is uh  you know but she  would probably argue  that point I think  everyone would argue  that point like well  fuck out we had a bed  too and this is what  happened to us right  yeah I think there's a  difference like I said  our you know in my  whole neighborhood  everybody got whacked  but we took it because  it wasn't a big deal  right there wasn't a  fear it's like I gotta  be home by five we're  still playing ball I'll  go home late and take  a fucking smack on my  way in and that'll be  it right and I my thing  was always just go down 
[03:04:00]  just hit the floor  whatever happens I did  that with my parents I  did it with cops  the cop would start to  fucking hit when we  were kids go right  down my old man used  to call me the bad  actor because if he gave  me a smack I'd go over  the fucking table  I would come up  it was very wrestling  mover I was just  acting like I was  shaking it off and  then go back down  again that's funny  right and the same  thing if the cops start  to fucking swing at  people just don't 
[03:04:30]  fucking just go down  yeah and then  they're like oh shit  fuck what did I do  hurt that kid hey  Ronnie you ever had  your mom come on  and get you and start  smacking the shit out  of you outside in the  fucking street yeah  and then pull your  ass in and slapping  you and you go in  front of your friends  yeah so she humiliated  you in front of the  whole neighborhood  but it was we were  accustomed to it  because that seems  more normal yeah  you know oh I've  heard a lot of those  type of stories oh  Mars got in trouble  no big deal you know  and then you know  Willie might get in  trouble tomorrow we  always your penis  I understand what did 
[03:05:00]  he do yeah Mars  talks about him in  third person that's  funny Willie  Willie got me in  trouble again  yeah I'm trying to  explain my situation  a little bit to  Ronnie here I don't  know if I'm fully  explaining it hey  there was like a  there was always like  a sadness there was  always like a black  cloud there was  there was always an  issue over just 
[03:05:30]  dumb stuff no one  no one really acted  up you know just  normal acting up in  our family but it  was always just an  extremely big deal  you know if he came  home a little drunk  or something at 17  18 normal shit like  that would just be  just horrendous a lot  of just yelling and  screaming and my dad  you know a great guy  but would just sit  there and just kind of  allow her to run the  household like this  you know everything  was a big fucking  deal it's the only way  I could explain it  just dumb shit that  might have been a  quick little you know 
[03:06:00]  two minute thing like  don't do that or  clean your room became  this over the top  fucking thing see  the weird thing is  Fez had the same  thing where his dad  was uh passive  right his mom was  aggressive and you  saw how he turned  out right so you've  already I mean every  time that he uh you  know something comes  up it always go back  to well then my mom  and I'm like your mom  isn't fucking here  no yeah I'm just I'm  just yeah I'm just  saying that it doesn't  bother me to the level 
[03:06:30]  it used to for many  years now I'm just  bringing it up because  it's the discussion  today no but I think  the weirdest thing  about it and people  don't normally talk  about this but the  thing that hurts the  most is not being  loved that when you're  not loved enough when  you're a kid then that  makes you feel like  you're unlovable and  then you spend the  rest of your life you  can't accept and give  love all right here's  the weird thing and I  don't know if I've ever  mentioned on the air I  was completely loved by  my mom completely she  just had a weird way of  fucking showing it I 
[03:07:00]  see that I have no  doubt that my mom to  this day loves this  shit out of me but  then my dad what does  love even mean what  the hell is it if it's  love how come it can  be so explosive right a  little while later I  mean and that adds to  our fucking confusion  right that's why we go  through life yeah but  I'm not acting the way  we should act yeah  that's a good point you  know but I have no  doubt I was loved but  you know she would she  would always try to do  the right thing but she 
[03:07:30]  just had her own issues  that always got in the  fucking way you know but  I mean Christmas was  beyond amazing our  birthday she she fucking  cooked every night a meal  and we all sat down she  really did fucking try  absolutely but then  would just fly off the  handle over the dumbest  shit all the fucking  time and that's the  lesson I learned because  for many years that's  what I did obviously  everyone knows but it's  been a few years now  where I don't do that  shit anymore I realize  how stupid that is and 
[03:08:00]  how it actually hurts  you yeah so the same  way it would be for  you like if things  didn't work out  perfect everyone knows  you can fucking pull a  million fucking clips of  me losing my fucking  mind and and a lot of  times I had a good  point to make but when  you're yelling and  screaming and flying off  the handle no one's  gonna listen to you  they can obviously look  at you like you're a  fucking idiot you're an  asshole you're a dick  you're a lunatic right  so I purposely purposely  try not to yell that  much and it's been a few  years now so you then  become your dad instead 
[03:08:30]  of your mom then you  let all this stuff go  on but inside no I try  to like just handle it  from a different angle  I'm not giving up on  like my feelings and and  you know things I want  to express but instead  of yelling and screaming  it I'm trying to find  another way well your  wife doesn't yell either  though she doesn't yell  at the kid either no  there are times like I'll  raise my voice in my  house and she'll go  stop yelling I'm like  wow this is so not  yelling my definition of  yelling it's so  different you know  yeah it's interesting 
[03:09:00]  I'm sorry yeah it's  interesting how with you  therapy works because you  let you let it out you  know and I don't know  it's just cool to talk  about it like a lot of  people when they find a  therapist they're expecting  some fucking magic cure  from the person you're  talking to but really  they're there just to let  to really just listen and  let you just you know get  it out I mean there's so  many times when I'm  sitting and talking to  therapy I go holy fuck  that's why I do that like 
[03:09:30]  I have the realization  she's not telling me from  a stupid textbook what's  going on I think a good  therapist shows up late  like Judd Hirsch in  ordinary people that's  what a therapist does  yeah because of the  swimming you know you  call them on a pay phone  you remember something  about Buck and they  show up for you yeah you  saved yourself seriously  you had to but if you're  uh if you go if you go  to a therapist you were  the strong one if you go  to a therapist and think  she's gonna fucking lay out  your plan for you you're  you're on you're on the  wrong path they're  perceptive they ask  questions that are smart  like they they kind of  guide you a little bit  right but it's very it's 
[03:10:00]  very subtle if you got a  good one very subtle the  how they guide you with  these little questions and  then you will uh you go  with that that thought or  that question for a while  Mars are you thinking you  couldn't even go no I  don't think speaking about  it helps not me I'm not  the type I'm not the type  to talk about something  that's he thinks he's not  what yeah that's silly no  it's reason being because  everyone's the type to  talk about what the fuck's  going on in their in their  lives okay I can probably  talk about it but I'm 
[03:10:30]  saying the end result will  still be the same we  didn't do anything nothing  changed I went through  experience so what change  yeah you learn to this  shit you're supposed to  change you're not the  problem is a lot of  people Ronnie's you're  gonna nod your head  Ronnie knows you know  you get in these  situations with people in  your life and and and  you waste so much fucking  time waiting for them to  change that's not gonna  happen you're supposed to  change you're supposed to  change how you handle that  person but talking about  it I don't know yeah  because you're an alpha  male you talked about it  yesterday for the first 
[03:11:00]  time and it was different  you made you feel better  it was maybe it was a  relief that that is  possible but I'm talking  like with a relative  never change no I know  that she affects you to  this day we saw it  yesterday on this show you  had tears in your eyes  that was a big moment  did not nobody saw that  but I'm just said it's  okay sorry but it is okay  forget about her she'll  never fucking change  she'll always be that  person I know that but  I'm just saying speaking  about it doesn't really I  don't know it doesn't do  anything for me because  I've tried speaking about  it with other people I  just think about it with  your wife yes and yes in 
[03:11:30]  the past but it doesn't  do anything I mean it  doesn't make me feel  better it makes me angrier  when I speak what happened  yesterday or here I was  getting fucking angry that's  good yes what's wrong with  that what's so good about  anger getting out beyond the  anger's just a smokescreen  Mars it's about her  feeling pain anger is just  safe that's a male it's  easy for us anger is easy  we're in control when we're  angry Jimmy's right too  man and here's the  transition you're at the  age now that it's time for 
[03:12:00]  you to start the warrior has  to go in a different place  and you go on you become the  wise man you become the  medicine man this is what  happened as we evolve as we  age you don't want to stay  in any one thing that's why  nobody likes a guy who's  fucking 38 running around  like he's 18 okay so you  you've created this warrior  character you wanted to  protect yourself and the  people around you now  slowly surely you move on  to become about wisdom and  that's what you get from  understanding yourself 
[03:12:30]  you're not holding on to  this shit you at least get  knowledge why this happened  and why maybe you do certain  things and then maybe you can  help somebody else who's got a  problem you're like hey I know  what you're talking about I  went through this and this is  how I came out the other side  right now you're just stuck at  that early part that you  wouldn't deal with why why did  this happen to me what did I do  what did they do why so you  want to find that out and you  can move on I just think I'm  good with it that's fine that's 
[03:13:00]  up to you I think I'm good with  it you're 47 you're wearing  camouflage Mars  I'll fucking not see you're  still trying to hide it's true  are you hiding from your mom you  think she's gonna pop up yes  hide behind a bush or something  like a Puerto Rican Clarice  Starling  right  camouflage that says it all you're  still trying to run in maybe  she'll hit the bush instead of  you  oh lord well I want to make that  point again really I mean you  know the people around you that 
[03:13:30]  cause all this strife they're  they're never gonna fucking change  yeah I know you have to fucking  change how you deal with that  shit and I didn't know that for  many fucking years trust me many  fucking years as soon as I learned  that lesson that made things a lot  easier  oh yeah  yeah  this is hilariously bad  more of Opie and Anthony's worst of  2013 so far  so far  coming up  must hear moments from the past  six months 
[03:14:00]  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013  so far  continues  continuing on with the worst of  2013  2013 so far  Opie and Anthony are on vacation  all week  in the meantime I'm like you  I don't get vacations  so what am I gonna do  share  the best things  that have happened on the Opie and  Anthony show  so far  in this year  2013  the year of our lord  Opie became an urban explorer  this year  Opie has been on a quest for quite 
[03:14:30]  some time  for that viral video gold  all he wants is a YouTube hit  there was a day when having a radio show  that paid him millions of dollars  just to bullshit all morning  would be enough  but no  that's not enough for him anymore  he wants that  excuse me  he wants  he wants that viral video  and he'll do whatever it takes  to get it  Moses Gates stopped by  Moses Gates is a guy  who took Opie  underground  on top of buildings  everywhere  that you're not supposed to go 
[03:15:00]  in New York City  we got some great video  out of it  which you can see  at youtube.com  slash Opie radio  we also got  some great radio  out of it  which you can hear right now  Moses Gates  in studio  on the worst of Opie and Anthony  2013  a year in review  something like that  so far  the worst of 2013  so far  the Opie and Anthony show  we got my new friend  Moses Gates  in studio  hey how you doing man  Moses  it's MosesNYC 
[03:15:30]  on twitter  and of course  he's the author  of Hidden Cities  travels to the secret corners  of the world's greatest metropolises  a memoir  of urban exploration  it's on Amazon  Barnes and Noble  iBookstore  books a million  and indie bound  damn that's like  it's going to be a big book  that's for real  I hope so  a lot of people are pre-ordering  just because of the videos we made  yeah that was a crazy time  man that was a fun day  yeah that was  I finally said it  the same  I think it was last week  I posted three videos 
[03:16:00]  it was all in one day  that we did all that shit  yeah  and we were on the ground  for at least two and a half hours  yeah because that's a  it was about a three mile walk  and we stopped a little bit  so  yeah  I think that was like  a four or five hour day  I would think even longer  but yeah  I was going to say  five or six hours  but  I found out that  Moses was coming in  and Roland goes  hey man  he's more than willing  to show you around  a little bit  I'm like  fuck yeah  and the one thing  I always wanted to see  was where mole people  was filmed 
[03:16:30]  yeah  not mole people  oh fuck  I forgot the name of it  Dark Days  Dark Days  thank you  thank you  thank you  the black and white movie  and it so happens  it's relatively close  to where I live  and I've walked that area  a ton of times  near the water  and all of a sudden  man  you know  I show him  Moses goes  alright  meet me by the statue  statue  Eleanor Roosevelt  yeah  it was all creepy  like I was in  in the middle of some  like game of clue  or something  meet me at the statue  well it's no fun 
[03:17:00]  if you know  we just meet at a coffee shop  or something  right  and then I like  I just trusted you  because of Roland  I didn't know him  and all of a sudden  I meet him at the statue  and there's Moses  I'm like  alright  and then he doesn't  I'm expecting flashlights  and all sorts of shit  we did have one flashlight  but he didn't check the battery  so we're underground  for three hours  in the dark  I'm like  oh man  we could have used a flashlight  oh shit  so you gotta read the book  because there's at least  three times in the book  where I forget a flashlight  so you would know  that it's always me  wouldn't that be  the number one thing 
[03:17:30]  that should be  the number one thing  is you  like yourself  second thing  the flashlight  so you can see  in a way  it was cool  that we didn't have  a flashlight  because a lot of times  we were walking  and it was pitch dark  and remember  the one moment  I almost fell into  a fucking hole  yeah you gotta watch for that  there's holes  like big fucking holes  down there  and there just happened  to be light in this area  we were walking  just chatting  you know  bullshit  and all of a sudden  I'm like  holy fuck  we almost walked  into this pretty  impressive hole  there was one time  this is a long time ago 
[03:18:00]  I was in an old  abandoned courthouse  and I just fell backwards  down a hole  just like  really  bang  yeah  wow  fell about like  seven or eight feet  got up  hurt to breathe  got on the number two train  checked myself into  Harlem General  right  waited a couple hours  in the emergency room  and you know  I ended up okay  but you always gotta  pay attention  that's the point  right  holy  where was that courthouse  on 163rd  and Boston Road 
[03:18:30]  up in the Bronx  is it still  something you could  like check out  I don't think so  because they're  redeveloping it  I mean it's this  beautiful beautiful  old courthouse  and it was abandoned  I want to say  since the 1970s  but I'm not sure  and they've been  redoing it  they've been rehabilitating it  I think it's gonna be  a community center  I'm not 100% sure  but that whole area  has been built up a lot  what'd you get to see in there  before you fell backwards  like have you been to any  of the downtown courthouses  or any  you know  just an old courthouse  downtown  I've been in an active one 
[03:19:00]  yeah we've been in  a few active ones  over the years  imagine that  and there's a  there's a real  cool statue  up on top also  so just imagine  like  one of those  old beautiful courthouses  with the  staircases  and the railings  and everything like that  but just empty  there were also  old jail cells  in there too  really  yeah in the basement  and also I think  on the fourth floor  you feel like you're  walking through  like Silent Hill  or something  yeah like  one of those  creepy video games  right  so we went  where Dark Days 
[03:19:30]  was filmed  where the mole people  used to live  and that's below  I guess  the West Side Highway  more or less  yeah like  underneath Riverside Park  Riverside Park  really  and you could kind of  see the West Side Highway  through some of these  gates that open up  yeah it's crazy  because you're down there  and you can hear people  like walking their dog  above you  yeah wow  we saw one  we yelled to them  and I was like  oh great  if fucking Moses  was a serial killer  I'm fucked right now  somebody was getting  a Frisbee or something  and I didn't know 
[03:20:00]  I thought people  still lived on the ground  I finally learned  that that's pretty much  not true anymore  there's a few stragglers  here and there  but in general  people aren't living  underground in that area  yeah no that's correct  because what happened  was that was an active  rail line for decades  it was a freight line  like you know the  High Line right  yeah  so the High Line  used to connect  to that rail line  and it would take freight  from the Bronx  or from upstate  down to the meatpacking district  and that was the whole purpose  and the High Line  for the people outside New York  they made it into 
[03:20:30]  a walking park  it's really cool  you know railroads  are obviously above ground  but they made it  it's really a nice  little thing to check out  if you come to New York  so anyway  they decommissioned  that as a freight line  in I believe 1980  and then that entire tunnel  was abandoned  from 1980  until the 1990s  what a great time  yeah  when they started running  Hamtrak through it  yeah  yeah so that was just  a giant wide open space  and it was perfect  for people to just go  chill down there  and with you know  crack and 
[03:21:00]  like the perfect timing  right  the gritty  dirty New York  and everything  shit  shanty towns  popped up  must have been crazy  down there  how many people  live down there  at it's height  I mean nobody  really knows  my best guess  would be a couple  hundred  but I'm not  that was it  I'm not the guy  that had  I wasn't there  back then  yeah  I mean stuff  gets exaggerated  right  right  yeah but then we  you know  we popped down  one of these holes  yep  and then this whole  world opened up  it was so cool  I mean 
[03:21:30]  I'm not gonna lie  I was trying to be cool  but as soon as you said  we're going down  this hole  I was like  I was ready to bail  I'm like  no fucking way  and he found  and the first hole  we found  was just  not just garbage  like horrendous garbage  like almost  sewagey garbage  he's like  well this is the only one  I can find today  because these holes  pop up  yeah  and then  you know  the city takes  you know  covers them up  and then  they just find  another one  you know  they make another one  I do give you props  for meeting a strange man  in a park 
[03:22:00]  and following him  down a hole  in the ground  though  wouldn't be the first time  everybody will do that  hole  so we found a hole  and I went to Moses  you first  he went through  he's gotta lead the way  sure  poked his head up  that was a good one  because he didn't even know  he didn't know  if we were gonna just drop  straight down  he's like  no it was a good one  come on down  that's when I learned  that I had forgotten  the flashlight  and that my batteries  were out  oh nice  yeah  fussed around a while  and then we're like  eh 
[03:22:30]  it'll probably be fine  let your eyes adjust  and just kind of  walk around  it's dark down there  man  and then like  the greats  from above  give you some light  and that's where  all that cool artwork  was that you were  showing me  yeah there's a bunch  of great artwork  down there  and Ed Koch  I can't remember  if you were there  on that trip  or if it was  a different trip  no I know  what you're gonna say  yeah but Ed Koch  died Friday morning  and we were there  on a Sunday afternoon  and somebody had  already painted  a rest in peace  Ed Koch graffiti 
[03:23:00]  really  yeah  it was really cool  in the darkness  and now it's an active  railroad obviously  yeah Amtrak  Amtrak runs through there  now  and we saw  I think three or four  and at one point  we thought it was  one of those  slow moving fucking trains  like it was like  some people that were  gonna get us  in fucking trouble  you even panicked  I saw it on your face  like oh fuck  this is something  we don't really see  I mean I try to play it cool  but I'm always really nervous  on these things  right  right right  I would think  yeah 
[03:23:30]  you're getting  some people  some people are just  some people just  don't give a fuck  some people are just like  on we go  we're good  I'm always really nervous  and have to try to like  kind of play it cool  well some like that  is one thing  but the uh  the Chrysler building  that seemed like  a little more  you could get in  pretty big trouble for  I mean I disagree  I mean I don't know  I mean while we're on  the radio talking about  I guess we'll find out  but it's like  you know  it's all above board  you know 
[03:24:00]  there's nothing shady  so I don't know  I don't know  it's just  the floor is just empty  I read  I read uh  recently an article  was put out  about uh  people saying that  urban explorers  were helping  terrorism  by showing uh  the weaknesses of  I mean that's  that's that's the  silliest thing in the  world man  it's like one of those  things where like  it's 2013  folk like  if you like  think you're gonna  put the internet  back in a box  it's not gonna happen  so it's 
[03:24:30]  you know  the MTA  has an official  twitter feed  where they have  photos of the tunnels  you know  you can go to the  library and get  architectural plans  for everything  like it's just  stuff that's out there  and it's a much  better tack to take  to teach people  about the city  and teach them  like  here is what's  where  how you can get  out of places  in an emergency  it's much better  to have more  knowledge  rather than less  knowledge  he thinks everyone  should have the  opportunity to stand  on that eagle head  and apply to the 
[03:25:00]  top of the spire  where no one has  ever been  or very few people  have ever been  that's pretty fucked up  I was watching that  I was looking at that  that's crazy  the spire is cool  I made a mistake  though that's not  and I got called out  for it on I think  the YouTube comments  or something  where all that  concrete stuff  that's like  fireproofing  right  right  that's  and I messed that up  in the video  so  take the opportunity  to correct  but we  we leave the  underground tunnel  we didn't  we didn't get to  run into the cat lady  who's still living down there  I wanted to talk to her  what's her name again  Brooklyn  Brooklyn 
[03:25:30]  there's a lady named  Brooklyn  that has how many cats  a lot  oh man  like a lot  like dozens  I would say dozens  would be accurate  dozens of cats  she lives down there  full time  and the only reason  I bring this up  Moses and his pals  before he took me around  they spent the night  down there  with her  right  for her birthday  or something  yeah  so this was  that's fucked up  yeah you can read  about in the New York Times  my buddy Steve  was doing a big  underground trip  that you know  he did a lot more  than just that tunnel 
[03:26:00]  but I just joined him  for just the night  in the tunnel  with a few other  friends of mine  and yeah it was fun  we had a party  it's uh  if you look up  I think it's called  the wilderness  beneath your feet  on the New York Times  it documents it  it's got the whole story  right  I would just think  with something like  the Chrysler building  people would be afraid  you know  I mean that's an iconic  building that  maybe some shenanigans  up there would go on  and you know  people  because you try to get 
[03:26:30]  into this building  what you're hoping  they're going to talk to us  no no no  I'm just saying  you go into this building  and security is crazy  right  it would seem to me  like God  why wouldn't there be  more security  you think  well I just want to  walk people through it  so then  we jump in a cab  we're way up near Harlem  when we finally got out  of the tunnel  we walked  you said three miles  on the ground  two and a half  two and a half miles  on the ground  finally got out  where you get out  without really giving  your way to everybody  and the only people  we saw were other people  exploring by the way  down there  yeah every time I go 
[03:27:00]  I run into other folks  taking pictures  or doing whatever  yeah  not many  I mean a handful  I guess every time  you're down there  and then we jump in a cab  because I got something  really cool  but I don't want to tell you  I'm like alright  I guess I gotta trust you  even though I've only  known you three hours  come on  you know we bonded  in the tunnel  we did alright  and then we're in the cab  and then I see  the Chrysler building  coming up  I'm like holy fuck  I think we're going  to the fucking Chrysler building  no fucking way  what am I allowed to say  nothing  okay  well then we 
[03:27:30]  all I'm saying is  I'll say this  then we arrive  it's obvious  we're going into  the Chrysler building  and I could say this much  we got in the building  legit  I can say that  we weren't breaking  we weren't breaking any laws  I don't know what laws  we broke officially that day  but I certainly know  we didn't like  illegally enter the  Chrysler building  yeah I don't think  any actually  like yeah I mean  the 61st floor  is just empty  that amazes me  the 61st floor  is obviously  the old observational deck  or observation deck  no the old observation deck 
[03:28:00]  is 71  and that's actually  oh you know what  I got confused by that too  yeah the old observation deck  was all indoors  it's on 71  it's a private office now  61 it was just  an office building  and it was  there was a lawyer's office  wait the one with the  eagle's heads  what floor is that  61  oh  oh so they have an  observation deck  they used to  it closed in I think  1945  oh I thought where we were  was the observation deck  that was closed in 1945  why wouldn't that be  the observation deck  with the eagles right there  I don't know  they should make it 
[03:28:30]  an observation deck  because you can walk  outside there  they will make more money  than if they rent it out  as an office  and they will especially  make more money  than if they just  keep it empty  like I  if I would totally  make that into  an active observation deck  would be like so great  now I want to know  what's on the 71st floor  71st floor is  I forget what kind  of office is there  but it's a private office  it looks kind of the same  as the other floor  right  because the observation deck  I just assumed  was the floor with the eagles  because that all  would make sense 
[03:29:00]  you go outside  you take the pictures  near the eagles  I think it would be  the coolest thing  in the world  I would definitely  pay $10 to go out there  maybe even $20  who knows  so then we got up to  alright so that was 61  we got up to 61  it's an empty office  and I couldn't believe it  I was like  you gotta be kidding me  this whole floor  is empty  and it's just me and him  and these iconic eagles  I mean it's a great place  the last time I was there  they're doing work on it  so I'm pretty sure  it's gonna be rented up soon  if it's not already  wow they were working on it 
[03:29:30]  you went back after I went  I've been up there  a few times  since  yes I think so  yeah  I mean I've lost track  but yeah  wow  and then  you know  I'm taking a look around  outside  when we got outside  and  the guard rail's  not too high  that was a little freaky  yeah but it's fine  no I was alright  I was alright with that  and then I'm just  kind of taking a look around  checking it out  going holy fuck  I can't believe  I'm checking this out  and then I turn 
[03:30:00]  to my left  and you're just like  sitting on the eagle's head  without even telling me  well yeah  I mean  what's the point of like  going 99% of the way there  and then not going all the way  but why would you want me to  like film that at first  I mean we did some things afterwards  but I'm like  this is so no big  my point is  it was such a no big deal to you  that you just  walked out there  you didn't need to get my attention  or anything  you're like  ah I'm here  I love being here  I'm gonna go sit out  on the eagle's head  for a little while  while he takes a look around  yeah  yeah 
[03:30:30]  I mean it's perfect  like think of it this way  right  you have this table here  this table is made  this like part right here  is maybe the size  of the eagle's head  even like  you  if I told you  jump up and stand  on this table  right here  you'd be like  whatever  no big deal  we all understand  how that works  you know  I'm able to ride a bike  on a sidewalk  without ever thinking  I'm gonna veer off  and you know  hit the grass  right  but if you put that  over the Grand Canyon  yeah put a floating sidewalk 
[03:31:00]  above the Grand Canyon  you would lose  nine out of ten people  easy  even though they would never  yeah yeah  well that made the point  so  so we're on 61  checking out the eagles  and then  and then  that's what Moses said to me  I think we can go higher today  I'm like what  now what  yeah so we get up to  we get up to  the crown I guess  and it's  yeah but how  the triangular  the triangular windows  yeah right  but so we're on 61  I think the elevator 
[03:31:30]  ended more or less  a little further up  right  but we didn't use  elevators at that point  we're just kind of  walking the stairs  the stairs ends where  the stairs ends  at I believe  76  I'm fairly sure  is the highest  actual floor  and then after  76 stories  yeah  and then after that  it's just like ladders  and you gotta haul yourself  up through a couple  of cross beams at times  it's just kind of  monkeying around  I'm not gonna lie to you  we were in a certain area  around 76 I'll say  and it looked like 
[03:32:00]  we were at a dead end  and I was kind of relieved  I was like alright good  I got some cool footage  I know I got a video  or two out of this  this day  let's get the fuck  out of here  and then of course  this guy  always is trying to  the little I know about it  but I figured it out  he's like no man  I can't give up now  I'm here  I gotta see if there's  anything else I can do  before I  you know  call it a day  and he did a couple moves  that I was just like  what the fuck  and next thing you know  well you know  his head is popping  over the side  going hey meet me  over here  I'll just say that 
[03:32:30]  but I mean  I don't  I'm  and that was the floor  where my video starts  where now we have  to climb the ladders  I mean I'm an okay climber  but I'm not a professional  rock climber or anything  you know  like I'm fairly in shape  and can make a couple moves  but like  I've been places  like I was  with my friend  Timmy O'Neill  who's like a really  great professional  rock climber  and he's  like I've been you  when I'm with him  where he's just like  boop boop boop boop  climbing around  buildings and shit 
[03:33:00]  and I'm just like  ah  but it's just  he knows he can do it  he's comfortable with it  so I don't freak out  you know  so people have  how do they access  some of those antennas  and electronics  up there for maintenance  well I mean  that's the thing right  all of these places  are places that  human beings have to go  for maintenance  for repair  for whatever like that  so there's always  a way to get there  yeah yeah  but some  I have a friend of mine  also who works on  a telephone repair  and you know  it's the same 
[03:33:30]  he's always telling me  I should go be a telephone  pole repairman  or something like that  or a cell phone  antenna repairman  you're not scared  of heights at all huh  not really  I'm pretty good with heights  I mean  it doesn't freak me out now  well thanks to you  I now get anxiety  I feel so bad  I didn't know  I'm not even joking  I didn't know I was  no I was never that guy  but since I filmed  you on the eagle  I've just seen you  I'll tell you to your face  I've seen you fall  a million times  as I'm trying to go  to sleep at night  alright  I just see how  it could have easily happened 
[03:34:00]  has this affected  his performance at work  in the mornings  is he alright  no I think he's okay  but  no it's not that bad  but  I just  I just see it  it's reason number 20  that he can't sleep  so Hidden Cities  man  we haven't really  talked about the book  so I'm going to  take us through the book  a little bit  alright  so it's Hidden Cities  it's available in bookstores  everywhere  on the internet  all like that  and it's just a memoir  of me  adventuring around the world 
[03:34:30]  trying to go places  I want to go  see things I want to see  it starts in about  2005  is when I started  to really get into this  I went around  a bunch of places  with my buddy  Steve Duncan  who's a really  really great photographer  and you should check out  his website too  undercity.org  go there  so  it's the kind of thing  where I started  by going  we started going  to France  was the first place  abroad we went  we went to Italy  so you got a lot of money  no I travel really cheap 
[03:35:00]  so everybody  asked me this  right  I was working  as a double decker  tour bus guy  when I did all this stuff  hustling for $20 an hour  on the tours  $10 an hour  if you're waiting  for tours  so I travel really cheap  it doesn't cost any money  to sleep in a tunnel  and it's the kind of thing  where when you're a tour guide  there's high season  and low season  so we did most of these trips  in the winter  like in February  when there's no tourists  money is not  like you can travel cheap nowadays 
[03:35:30]  time is harder than money  getting the time  to do the stuff  is the challenge  alright so you go  to France and Italy  yeah we went to France  we went to Italy  Naples and Rome  we went to Sweden  London  Russia  Russia was the scariest  man we almost got  arrested in Russia  that was probably  the scariest moment  I've ever had in my life  yeah we just  so we're  we're in Russia right  and we meet some  local Russian kids  and for those of you  who don't know  the Russians are the 
[03:36:00]  craziest motherfuckers  in the world  well we see their videos  exactly  yeah yeah  hang and do their push-ups  and pull-ups  I should say  yeah it's the kind  hang with one arm  thousand feet off the ground  somebody tweeted  they were like  me is less than  these guys  is less than  every Russian teenager  and I was just like  that is so true  some of that shit  where they're just  hanging  yeah you weren't  trying to say you were  that's crazy  you weren't  trying to say that  you were better than  these guys  they're on a whole  another trip  yeah they're on  some crazy stuff 
[03:36:30]  what are they thinking  he's doing pull-ups  from an I-beam  that's just  you know  you fall  you're just dead  yep  how do they get up there  they just  they don't give a fuck  in Russia  they let the kids  go wherever the hell  they want huh  pretty much  there's some great  videos of them  there's these  seven buildings  called the seven  sisters in Moscow  that are topped  by stars  like the red  communist star  and they  like one of their  games is to try  to get to the top  of all seven  of the stars  they have videos  like reach for the star  number two  number three  I don't know 
[03:37:00]  if they've gotten up  all seven  but anyway  so we're in Russia  and we're hanging out  with these Russian guys  and oh good lord  I'm watching that  this guy was  Sam looked away  he's on a high beam  about how many feet  would you say that  offhand  oh a few hundred  at least  yeah  five six hundred feet  maybe  definitely  you're dead  and he's doing pull-ups  and he's letting go  you know  as you pull up  he lets go  for a split second  oh wait  is that the top  of the Moscow Bridge  in Kiev  is it 
[03:37:30]  I don't know  but I  no it's not  oh man  so there was  this one bridge  we climbed in Kiev  and we kind of  went the easy way  we went inside  and up to the top  and I was feeling  all cool with myself  and then like later  I see this video  of like  these rut  like this 15 year old  Russian girl  who like climbed  up the stay cables  and did it like  the insane way  in the middle of the day  and I'm like  holy shit  well I'm not cool  Russian bruts  yeah  so anyway  we're in Russia  a lady used that talent  for a stripper pulse  climb right up  them stripper pulse  love them Russians 
[03:38:00]  and we decide  to go in a tunnel  we decide to go  on the underground  Naglinka River  which Moscow  was formed  at the intersection  of the Moscow River  and the Naglinka River  and then they put  the Naglinka River  underground  so we decide  to go through  the Naglinka River  and we're out  kind of  at the outskirts  of the ring road  and we pop a manhole  and the guy we're with  is like  you know  dressed in this  like semi-official  looking vest  and I'm like  is this cool  are people going to stress  and he's like  no no  the only time  people care about  anything is by  the Kremlin  with the special 
[03:38:30]  government police  and we're like  okay fine  so we go down  into the tunnel  and we're walking  along and it's  I think like  maybe a couple  of miles  and we get  to the end  and we've walked  right under  Red Square  come on  I swear to god  that's special  impossible shit  so we're under  Red Square  we come to the  outflow  and it's kind of  raining a little bit  just like a little bit  and for those of you  contemplating draining  or going underground  or whatever  the like  number one  cardinal rule  is do not go in 
[03:39:00]  drains if it's raining  or gonna rain  because you will  completely die  really  yeah  because everything  even if it's only  a little trickle  everything that hits  cement is eventually  going to roll  into the gutter  and then go into  a small drain  and then go into  the big collector  drain where you are  so you know  your drain is  let's say  eight feet by  eight feet  that is not  large enough  to handle the runoff  for an area  of like acres  around you  that's coming at you  so if you're in a  drain when it rains  you're just  you know  the water level 
[03:39:30]  levels just  so we start  to kind of  freak out  we're like  we gotta get  out of here  we run back  and the first  manhole we come to  is right by  I wanna say  the Bolshoi theater  it's like the theater  that's right  by the Kremlin  and the guy  we're with  is like  okay this is like  the worst way  to get out  but we're just  gonna pop the manhole  we're gonna scurry out  and we're gonna  hope nobody's around  in Russia  oh man  come on  I can see if it's in 
[03:40:00]  I don't know  Cleveland or something  yeah so we're like  okay  so we pop the manhole  we scurry out  there's like  I think  I think that there's  five or six of us  and we're right by  this huge statue  of Karl Marx  so we sit  so we go out  we put the thing  in the ground  nobody else is around  we're like  thank god  we made it  we're okay  we sit down  by the Karl Marx  instead of getting  the fuck out of there  which is like  what you always  always always  should do  we just decide  to like hang out 
[03:40:30]  and be happy  with ourselves  and like  we're all wearing  like rubber boots  and hip waders  and have like  these giant backpacks  and tripods  hanging out  from backpacks  and all that thing  so we're just  hanging there  being happy  with ourselves  looking completely  ridiculous  like  why are we  dressed like  we're gonna go  fishing  in the middle  of Red Square  and we just  get rolled up on  by these three  like government  police machine guns  and everything  and it was just  like the scariest  moment of my life  I imagine those guys  are everywhere  right  you can't do anything 
[03:41:00]  yeah yeah  so it ended up  being cool  you know  the Russian guys  talked to him  for a while  and eventually  they took off  we pretended  we didn't  you know  well we obviously  didn't speak Russian  but we also pretended  we didn't speak English  and we're just like  oh no  you know  playing dumb  sometimes works  but it was like  those five minutes  between when they  rolled up on us  and when they left  were just like  I was like  Jesus Christ  I'm gonna end my life  in a Russian prison  like what is the point  of that  that could be  an interesting exploration 
[03:41:30]  yeah  exactly right  a gulag  gulag  locked up abroad  yeah then you do  locked up abroad  so  that's crazy  there's so much  in the book  but where were  some of the  coolest places  some of the ones  some of the highlights  that you really  were like  holy cow man  um so  I'm gonna spoil  the end of the book  which I maybe  shouldn't do  but the  the second to last  chapter of the book  we're in Egypt  and I really wanted  to climb the pyramids  and just  read the book 
[03:42:00]  but the circumstances  didn't allow for it  and it completely  grated on me  for like  two and a half years  and finally  a couple of months ago  I went back  and did it  so I was  and you know  who's doing it now  all the crazy  Russian Skywalker  climbing guys  are all really into it  so obviously  you were trying  to go legit  and climb the pyramids  what  no back then  when they said no  oh you just  couldn't figure out  a workaround  I just bottled it  I just got  I just got too scared  and just couldn't  figure it out  and bottled it 
[03:42:30]  yeah  so you climbed  to the top  of one of the pyramids  yeah really fun  with a couple of friends  isn't that kind of hard  because those blocks  are pretty fucking  the climb's pretty easy  it is  yeah the climb is  oh that's it right there  oh yeah  oh hey  look at that  wow  oh my god  is that cool  where's this picture  that's on  twitter  I think I tweeted it  yeah that's my  that's my friend  the guy who took it  are you at the top  top right there  yeah yeah  the guy who took it  is the guy at the right  that's my friend  my friend QX  who's in the book  how the fuck 
[03:43:00]  did you do that  you just do it  like all these  like a lot of times  people are like  how did you do that  what's  is there a secret tunnel  is there a like  a code or a password  or something like that  and the answer is like  honestly just the way  you think you do it  you know you just  wow  sneak in in the middle  of the night  and just do it  right  there's no guards  I mean if there are  they're pretty lazy about it  so I actually  how long did that climb take  maybe like 20 minutes  I want to say  oh okay  and it was pretty easy  obviously  I mean it was 
[03:43:30]  it was exhausting  it was definitely like  an exhausting climb  but it wasn't  technically difficult now  wow  wow  and that's what  the top looks like  the top is  covered in scratches  like every square  inch of the top  is like  you know  Joe was here  1952  oh no kidding  like the entire thing  yeah because the things  are 3000 years old  you know  there's been a lot of time  and you could  climb up them  until the 80s  until the 80s  it was just  kind of chill  or maybe you know  tip the guard 
[03:44:00]  something and do it  they only started  getting uptight  about it  in the mid 80s  so a lot of this stuff  is stuff that  50 years ago  or 100 years ago  or you know  even 20-30 years ago  is not a big deal  and it's only a big deal  now  like you could climb  the pyramids  in the 80s  you could go to the  observation deck  of the Chrysler building  in the 1940s  like I sneak into  Stonehenge here  just after hours  just kind of walked up  and hung out of Stonehenge  for a little bit  but what do you see  after hours  that you don't see  during the day  like it's just 
[03:44:30]  you go during the day  you roll up  they send you through  the tchotchke shop  you pay 15 quid  you have these ropes  everybody stand behind  the ropes  taking pictures  if you just go at night  you just do whatever you want  like you can go  you go there  you walk up the hill  you hang out  you kiss the rock  I don't know  it's just a different experience  you know  it's a different experience  but you know  you could do that  just hang out  at Stonehenge  70 years ago  so a lot of this stuff  is not new  I mean I want to stress that  like none of this is  new or discovery 
[03:45:00]  or whatever  a lot of it is  just as more and more  people travel  as you know  things go on  things become more and more  and more restricted  and this is kind of a response  to that restriction  if stuff was more chill  it wouldn't be a big deal  you think this book  is going to fuck it up  for others  I don't think so  I mean it's  A. I don't talk about  a whole bunch of really  like tight stuff  in the book  a lot of it is  takes place  between 2005  2007  and the stories 
[03:45:30]  that were crazy  to me  back in 2006  are not  crazy stories  so much anymore  I mean they will be  for the reader  but like not for me  so something like  going into the catacombs  was the  like  I was like  wow this is the craziest  thing I've done in my life  I'm flying across the world  I'm going in a hole  in the ground  and the catacombs  are like  urban exploration 101  you know  really  yeah absolutely  but you could go there  on a legit tour  right  yeah you can do  what do you get to do 
[03:46:00]  differently  so on a short tour  of the catacombs  they take you down  it's a self-guided  walking tour  you go  down into the tunnels  you walk for about  I think about a half a mile  or so  through the tunnels  and it's where all the bones are  and the bones are like  neatly stacked  and everything like that  if you just go in  a different way  through a hatch  or a hole in the ground  you've got about  170 miles to navigate  you know  it's not like  one little tunnel  with a 90-inch path  it's like playing  Dungeons and Dragons 
[03:46:30]  holy fuck  it's like you look at the map  and you're like  literally like  wow when I was 13  I was a  you know  half-elf mage  going through here  it's really crazy  you could spend a week  down there easy  I didn't realize  it was so big  yeah no  it's gigantic  it runs almost  from the Seine  to the southern border  of Paris  like it runs  almost entirely  under the 14th  or on DC Met  like you can walk  I mean well  we  actually my friend 
[03:47:00]  Steve organized a trip  where we tried to walk  underground  underneath Paris  like underneath  the entire city of Paris  so you can get  from the southern border  to almost the Seine  like you can walk  the entire south bank  in the catacombs  and then we did  sewers for the north part  but how do you guys  figure out where to pop out  that's just knowledge  that's been passed around  that's like  you got to know  some folks sometimes  to figure that  because this is like  an underground culture  where you guys  share information  you got a little  something about New York  I'm going to trade  for a little something  about Sweden 
[03:47:30]  or whatever  I would call it  a network  like with a guy  we'll climb the pyramids  with  he lives in Paris  and you know  whenever I go  over there  we always hang out  and see stuff  and you know  we hang out  and see stuff  when he comes over here  a lot of it  are traveling Australians  Australians have these  like magic abilities  to live anywhere  and go anywhere  I don't know  but yeah  it's like a worldwide network  and you know  you know some people  and some people  know some other people  and there you go  you ever got arrested? 
[03:48:00]  I got arrested  I got arrested in France  once actually  it's the first story  in the book  we climbed up the  we were just  we were just  boozed man  we were just  it's like half  of these adventures  are just like  you're boozed  and you're like  well it seems like  a good idea  at the time  so we're in France  we're super boozed  this guy  this French guy  we were with  is like  hey do you want  to go climb a church  and we're like  sure we're up  for climbing a church  and like  we cross the river  and I'm like  I think the church  he's talking about 
[03:48:30]  is the fucking  Notre Dame  so we're just there  and we just  monkey it  like they've got  these little  scaffolding things  and we fit a couple  of them together  and we're rattling  like crazy  and you know  we get up a couple  of the terraces  and like  we just kind of like  finagle our way up  and you know  it's one of those things  where like  looking back on it  I don't know  how it took so long  for us to get arrested  but at the time  I was like  it's France 
[03:49:00]  it'll be fine  nobody will notice  but it was  a very chill experience  France is a little  more civilized  than some other places  or a little more Latin  so we're just up there  the cops come up  they're like  excuse us  you cannot be here  take us to the station  which is right across  the street  stick us in a  stick us in a cell  take our  do a little breathalyzer  test thing  and then after a couple  of hours  they took us  into the room  the police chief 
[03:49:30]  is there  police chief  is dressed like you  like you know  just like  casual  casual  he's like  okay  so did you get  good pictures  we're like  and I was like  I was freaked  because like  you know  I watch cop shows  I'm not answering  questions or anything  and I'm just like  he's like  you know  kind of rolls  his eyes at me  he has a piece  of paper  he's like  okay  so listen  you're a tourist  you're taking  pictures  you don't know  you can't climb  cathedral  you're very sorry  you don't do it again 
[03:50:00]  here sign this  you go away  and I was like  wow  in America  I'm not signing  anything a cop  puts in front of me  and it's like  sign this  you know  but France  it was just  it's just France  it's just a little  more chill  so I was like  alright  and he's like  he takes his pen  he gets up  takes his pen  walks out of the door  and just goes  voila  like that  and yeah  just throws it  over his shoulder  and I was like  wow  they are  would not do that  if they caught me  climbing St. Patrick's Cathedral  probably didn't talk 
[03:50:30]  to the police  just some assholes  that want to fuck with you  yeah  so that  that happened  in France  and yeah  that was  I got called  once here  in New York  but I got out  in a couple of hours  that was an interesting  experience  that's about it  nothing serious  what was the one  in New York  I just got caught  like  not even anything  real  just like  kind of  on the wrong  side of the fence  that really  should be  like a  not a big deal 
[03:51:00]  but for whatever  reason  they were uptight  about it  so they took us in  they got us out  in like two or three hours  but it was just  an interesting  experience  like I'd never been  in a New York City  jail or anything  so I was like  alright  well we'll find out  what this is like  so you know  I just got thrown in  with essentially  like the local  knuckleheads  for a few hours  and it was  you know  just seeing  that side of life  and you know  the thing I took  out of it  is just like  nobody was in there  for anything real  you know  people were in there  for like  I got an open 
[03:51:30]  container  or like  I was smoking weed  or like  you know  just  piddly garbage  things  that it's like  you know  and they all  like one of the guys  got  collared for an  open container  and he had  outstanding summons  for riding his  bike on the sidewalk  and you know  they sent him  through the system  like 24 hours  in jail  without like  you know  just disappeared  and it's just like  so a lot of folks  in there were just  in there on like  garbage stuff 
[03:52:00]  and it's like  ruins your whole  next day  getting a rest  record  like  it's just one  of those things  where it's like  it's a little  out of control  like in my opinion  now you said  that the best  place you'd like  to be is on top  of a bridge  in new york city  yeah  or any city  actually  how many bridges  have you been  on top of  a lot  brooklyn bridge  yep  manhattan bridge  yep  uh williamsburg  queensburg  have you climbed  outside  yeah  first  first  we all see  those  that shit  when we're going  across bridges 
[03:52:30]  and you always  kind of imagine  like ah  it'd be kind of  cool to walk  up this  exactly man  every  but that's where  it ends  for most people  right  but like  in sydney  australia  they have  a bridge climb  and it's  enormously popular  it does like  60 million dollars  of business  a year  or something  like everybody  goes  it's like  so cool  and the sydney  harbor bridge  is probably  the most  famous landmark  on the continent  you know  so it's something  where people are  like why do you  want to do that  and i'm like  don't you  want to do  that  and they're  like well  yeah of course  and i'm like  well then you  answered your  own question 
[03:53:00]  so i think  i mean i would  love it if  they could do  you know the  equivalent of a  sydney harbor  bridge climb  on the queensborough  i've said that  too  yeah i think it  would be i think  it would make a ton  of money and be  great for the city  no shit  but how do you  like climbing on  the outside of the  bridge  however they would  well that's how  they do it in  sydney though  yeah it's amazing  tells me there's  not many lawyers  and yeah i know  this is but this  is the kind of  thing where if  you have like the  will to figure it  out like you can  get around the  lawyer stuff like  i'm a firm  believer that the  people make the 
[03:53:30]  decisions and then  tell the lawyers  to make it work  what i understand  about climbing  bridges outside like  that is i mean  what all the cars  going by how the  fuck do you get  away with that  i haven't climbed  a bridge in a  while actually uh  in like uh you  definitely you know  in a while because  they're absolutely  watching bridges around  new york city these  days i mean folks  you have to go over  that first fence the  one fence that you  know people go all  right i gotta climb  over that and then  maybe fall into the  fucking river and  then i get on that  thing and then i go 
[03:54:00]  up well you know if  you don't yeah it's it  takes a little bit of  monkeying around  fuck takes a little  bit of monkeying around  but you know sometimes  it's i mean it's worth  it because being on  top of a bridge is the  most amazing experience  because like you get  two different views you  get two different  experiences like you've  been to long island  city or williamsburg and  you're looking across the  river at the skyline and  that's awesome and you've  been up to like the  empire state building or  whatever and you're  looking down on the  city and that's also  awesome if you're on  top of a bridge you get  those two things at once 
[03:54:30]  you get like the vertical  separation and the  horizontal separation it's  this totally unique view  and plus like you know  you're by yourself you're  on top of a bridge it's  like a really great  experience  jeez  why are you guys shaking  your heads at me i'll  drive on the bridge  no i think i like that  i absolutely think it's  cool it's just like  yeah crazy  there's one other uh  you ever have a near miss  where you had a little  slip besides the  falling in the hole at  the courthouse  no i've been pretty good  um so like getting 
[03:55:00]  arrested getting hurt all  of that stuff all comes  from just like getting  too happy with yourself  and not paying attention  it doesn't come from  like i've never had  or forgetting your  flashlight or forgetting  your flashlight yeah but  i've never had a near  miss batteries we were  all right though we ended  up okay it was only you  know it only fell in a  hole once but it all  comes from not paying  attention so the times  when i've ever been in  like had any kind of  slips or near misses have 
[03:55:30]  always been with stuff i  was comfortable with and  just got too comfortable  with it and did stop  paying attention all the  crazy stuff where i'm  like really hyper alert and  really like in the zone and  focused i've always been  okay with right okay and  finally um and brought this  to my attention the other  day that someone climbed up  um the world's fair what  what is that the observation  towers oh yeah the  observation towers at the  world's fair there was a  video recently was it a  video in or picture pictures  in his story he used the  grappling hook to get up 
[03:56:00]  there because he couldn't  is that my is that  steve's old story you found  on the website yeah it  might have been because i  remember he had i mean  that's got to be from like  10 years ago yeah i really  like that story i've always  it was a good one he's like  he's at night he's trying to  throw the grappling hook and  it's going clang clang on the  ground yeah yeah that's  steve's story really yeah  that's a good one but that's  from like i think 10 years  ago or like a while ago and  you've been up there too you  said right yeah i was up  there once you know not too  long after that probably like  six or seven years ago oh 
[03:56:30]  no i take it back i was up  there twice we were  peeled off of there once just  for fun wow really yeah  just off of the lower deck  not off of the super high  deck and you were telling  me the stairs are all gone  right the stairs are like  super rusty and like oh  you got the picture yeah you  can kind of see you get no  real treads on the stairs  they're just you got to kind  of walk up on the rails that  the treads used to be on and  yeah that's actually one of  the better ones  oh my god really yeah  jeez louise how do you get  back down it's oh it's oh 
[03:57:00]  the same way you get up  although they didn't i know  but it just seems easier to  climb up then when you're  seeing like it's a lot of  stairs missing and it's time  to climb down and that seems  almost scarier climbing down  is always easier for me because  i'm already in the zone and  like it's less i don't have to  like get hyped up for it they  did renovate the tower a couple  of years ago so they might have  painted it or some shit i  don't know yeah i can't  remember that but i mean  that's another place like  throw in a new staircase and  let people up there again i 
[03:57:30]  mean  seriously it's a great view  people would pay yeah  definitely people would pay  to see this shit  cool just find it so fun in  it like you can't do  anything in the city so i  can't imagine them allowing  you to do anything that  would be fun but there's  been there's been a lot of  stuff that's gotten reopened  because you have folks who  go there kind of gorilla style  take pictures people get into  it the high line like the  high line was this beautiful  old uh old abandoned rail line  got a lot of attention from 
[03:58:00]  people just walking on and  taking pictures and now it's  redeveloped uh another one is  the uh old city hall station  like this beautiful beautiful  old abandoned subway station  underneath city hall uh that's  one that now they open for  tours you got to join the  transit museum but you can go on  a tour like you finally go check  it out yeah so i think that  like once interest in this  stuff becomes known people you  know and it's known that hey  you know you can do tours you  can make a buck right stuff  happens and stuff gets opened 
[03:58:30]  like i love abandoned  observation decks and they  reopened the rockefeller  center observation deck was  abandoned for 20 years before  they reopened it and then you  fool around the subways where  you got to like time out the  trains going by and shit yeah i  haven't been the subways for a  minute either i don't reckon i  mean that one is like uh  you know if you have the urge to  go you're not going to get  talked out of it if you don't  have the urge to go you're not  going to get talked into it i  feel like um it's just one of  those things some people really  are into um but i haven't been 
[03:59:00]  in a minute so and that's to go  see the abandoned subway station  yeah there's a bunch of you know  there's a bunch of stuff in the  subways any of the big rats down  there  no see the thing is everybody  always asks me about rats and  tunnels rats live where there's  food and there's food where  there's people so most of the  rats in the subway stations are  actually in the stations because  that's where people are and  throw their garbage and stuff  like that they're not in the  tunnels because there's no food  in the tunnels i have run into  rats in the london sewers though  and it was really gross how big  well like some apparently cracked 
[03:59:30]  big and like a nice a nice  colony remember that someone  cracked a rat  you let a nervous fart out moses  who me yeah i don't get nervous  who farted i don't know but wow  sam no sam is that you i'm a lady  that's terrible very cool well  moses i think the book's gonna do  very well i want to have your back  because there's so much more we  want to cover like people want to  you know talk about their cities and  stuff like that yeah because every 
[04:00:00]  city has cool stuff to see definitely  i go to rochester a lot and i know  not a lot once or twice a year but um  they have a they have an abandoned  subway system up there yeah i've  never been i would love to go i  just read some articles on it's  pretty damn cool what they were  talking about i would love to see it  there's an abandoned subway system  and it's actually not abandoned it  was built and never used in a  cincinnati also so there's why do  they never use it i don't know the  entire story behind it i know that  you know they had constructed it and  then i think they ran out of funding 
[04:00:30]  or something like that i don't know  the entire story behind it i just  know there's this entire system in  antwerp there's a system that was  built and not used wow um also you  know wherever you are any city in the  world there's like stuff to see have  you got deep underground in new york  where the uh what are they called the  um the mud uh uh where the drilling  uh yeah what do they call them oh the  are you talking like the second avenue  the workers no even deeper than that  for the water tunnel number three no i've 
[04:01:00]  never been so yeah they call the  workers like mud mud rants or mud  sand hogs sand hogs of course sand hogs  so sand hogs are heroes of all of  ours uh we think sand hogs are like  the coolest people in the world uh so  they're digging a bunch of tunnel  projects they're doing digging a new  tunnel to grand central they're digging  the second avenue subway they were  they were doing the west side line  extending the number seven line they're  doing city tunnel number three so  there's a lot of tunnels and the mta  especially has been good about like  letting engineering students on tours and 
[04:01:30]  things like uh you know for  educational purposes and stuff so i've  gotten to go to a couple of them just  on official tours uh like is it cool  it's super cool man and it's the kind  of thing where like i was on the one  uh where they're digging the tunnel to  grand central and i was like why don't  you do these tours all the time and the  guy was just like we got a tunnel to  dig man we can't like right no kidding  all right fair enough you know but i you  know that's another thing like so many  people are interested in it and i think  they could uh you know definitely take 
[04:02:00]  you know you can't do it 24 7 but they  could certainly take more folks down  there uh the city water tunnel number  three i've never been to i'd really  like to go on uh on an excursion in  there oh yeah yeah it gets worse let's  get some asshole sniffing going let's  pep this place up into a mood of fun  and festivity more of opie anthony's  worst of 2013 so far coming up  six months worth of shows more than 500

[04:12:30]  and a plaque  build up  thick enough  to ice skate on  Jenkins always  gives a little  too much information  about his daughter  and his teeth  where does Jenkins  live  in his house  not like a little  trailer  with a hot plane  I live next door  to these Spanish  people in Cleveland  you're not very  perceptive  are you Jenkins  I'm a damn  good cop  I helped them  board up all  with windows  just so you can 
[04:13:00]  see the smile  and those little  captive  you can see  the smile  and to stop  that kid  they're always  waving at me  from up to the  window  I was afraid  they were gonna  fall out  so I boarded  up the window  they love playing  police with you  absolutely  I would always  walk in there  and make sure  that the handcuff  things on the  wall are good  and tight  holy fuck  Jenkins  we got another  one  Tom go ahead  Tom  the press is  gonna have a 
[04:13:30]  field day with  this  yes  Jenkins never  doing things  the press really  are sympathetic  tell them what  you have to  they're just  gonna muck up  the works  anyway  always in trouble  but heart of  gold  heart of gold  what was it  it was tough  as nails  with a heart  of gold  heart of gold  I don't see  it getting  picked up  I've already  got like a  bunch of  episodes written  oh yeah 
[04:14:00]  different things  oh cool  like there's a  nuclear bomb  one time in  Times Square  in a box  and Jenkins  has to take it  and throw it  in the river  why is  that never  happens  but they get  like FBI  Homeland Security  things like that  they weren't  available  the cop  isn't doing  anything  he's doing  like fucking  crowd control  well he takes  time to matter  into his own  hands  while they're  all  they're just  mucking up  the works  oh mucking  up the works  is that like  his catchphrase  yeah  you're mucking 
[04:14:30]  up the works  and everyone  goes oh he said  it  he said it  you're mucking  up the investigation  it's like  dynamite  for Jimmy  J.J. Walker  so there's one  where he does  that  one where he  stops the hijacking  and saves all  the passengers  because like  the pilots  were like  got poisoned  so Jenkins  has to land  the plane  Jenkins lands  a plane  he lands  the plane  to 747  with like  300 people  on it  and he lands  it and saves  all their lives  this goose  can fly  Jenkins  keep your nose  up
