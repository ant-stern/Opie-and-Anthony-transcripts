<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a highly explicit call from Dini, who detailed her bondage and role-playing sexual experiences.  The hosts engaged in suggestive questioning, eliciting graphic descriptions of her practices.  This was followed by a call from Dane Cook, who humorously recounted comedian Bob Kelly's leg injury sustained while playing football.  They attempted to connect with the heavily medicated Kelly, resulting in a bizarre and comedic conversation about his injury and his plans to play paintball.  Bob Kelly was then present in studio for the remainder of the show.


Next, Sandy Kane appeared in-studio, immediately escalating the show's explicit content.  Sandy displayed a growth she claimed was a hemorrhoid, which the hosts believed to be a genital wart, leading to graphic descriptions and vulgar dialogue.  The hosts also commented on Sandy's pubic hair.  Her planned performance of a song titled "Shove It Up Me, Opie and Anthony," using a dildo, was hampered by technical difficulties.  A brief aside mentioned an intern's dislike of large bananas.  Simultaneously, a phone interview with Tommy Lee devolved into an argument after the hosts made comments about his penis size and Pam Anderson’s accusation that he gave her Hepatitis C.  Tommy Lee repeatedly hung up, and the hosts responded with offensive insults.  Bob Kelly’s reaction to Sandy's body and the "hemorrhoid/genital wart" was captured on video, culminating in him vomiting and leaving the studio.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Sandy’s body and the "hemorrhoid/genital wart," and a bit about a messed-up deli order for a staff member.


A later segment featured a listener's call about pending litigation (possibly involving Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson) and a discussion of Johnny Carson's death and the ensuing tributes from Jay Leno and others.  The hosts heavily featured a running gag involving their repeatedly-sent-out intern, Ricky, who was tasked with fetching coffee, bagels, and other items. Colin Quinn was mentioned as a listener.  The discussion about Johnny Carson included criticisms of Jay Leno's tribute and speculation about Carson's relationships with Leno and Letterman, along with anecdotes about Carson’s personality.  The hosts debunked urban legends surrounding Carson and his guests.  They played audio clips of Jay Leno's monologue and Ed McMahon's appearance on Leno's show.  This transitioned into a review of wrestler-themed albums (Hulk Hogan and Chris Jericho) and a call from Swiggy discussing Triple H's role in WWE.


The following segment began with a conversation with Chris Jericho, who discussed the dynamics of professional wrestling, internet rumors, and his radio show.  This segued into a discussion of anti-smoking advertisements, disturbing drunk-driving PSAs, and graphic descriptions of female genitalia, prompted by a photograph.  Ricky's struggle to bring the correct beverage (club soda versus seltzer water) further fueled the comedic moments. The second half featured a phone interview with Matt Hardy, who detailed his girlfriend Lita's affair with Edge, his subsequent release from WWE, and the fallout.  Hardy expressed his anger and frustration, discussed the public reaction, and speculated about Edge's influence within WWE and Hardy’s future. He also discussed Triple H's alleged backstage control.  The interview concluded with Hardy promoting his upcoming DVD.  The segment ended with a return to the hosts' discussion of the intern's apple.


The final segment heavily involved a visibly distressed Ricky, sent on numerous errands (bagels, seltzer, club soda).  His inability to eat a bad apple and the hosts' mockery of his mustache were key comedic elements. The segment then included calls from various celebrities – Joe Perry, John C., Brian Regan, Charlie Murphy, Lois Griffin, Ozzy Osbourne, and Larry the Cable Guy – who listened to a segment deemed the "worst of Opie and Anthony."  This was followed by a musical interlude with Stephen Lynch performing a song about a Nazi girlfriend, and chaotic musical performances by Grey Wolf and Tippi Tom, marked by off-key singing and instrumental playing. The show concluded with a song from Tippi Tom.

[00:10:30]  You did?  No.  Come on.  See, that would be an answer to the tied up thing.  Because that would be like, oh, please don't, you know, oh, don't have sex with me.  Don't.  Okay, look, we're not fucking around anymore.  Put that fucking thing away.  Untie me.  Untie me, bitch.  Green, green, green, green, green, green, green, green.  I can't say green all weekend.  No.  No one said green all weekend, huh?  No.  Oh, look at you.  All right, so what was the big moment for you? 
[00:11:00]  You had him tied up.  What do you do to a guy when he's tied up?  Oh, sometimes he likes a little bit of pain.  So, you know, nipple clamps or whatever.  Do you do any cockball torture?  No, no, no, I don't do that.  The twisting and mutilating?  No, not mutilating, I guess just twisting.  The nipple clamps.  Now you're tied up and you've got the big rod happening.  Now you've got your nippy and nipple clamps.  That's awful.  Well, some people are, you know, into that. 
[00:11:30]  Do you smother him at all?  Sit on his face?  Say that again, Norris.  Do you smother him at all?  Sit on his face?  No.  What do you do?  Just put nipple clamps on him and go, huh?  No.  Hey, how about that?  Look at you now.  Look what I do now.  Look what I do to you now.  All right, so you've got the nipple clamps on, then what?  That's what makes any of this ridiculous.  Yeah, because now you're sitting there like, yeah, you got me.  I got the nipple clamps.  And you've got to think the guy's just going, when are we just going to fuck?  We all do silly stuff in bed, and you're just, I don't know. 
[00:12:00]  You're so close the whole time, just bursting out laughing.  Yeah.  Because the whole act is ridiculous.  Because now you're tied up his arms and his legs.  He's got the rod, and he's got the nipple clamps on.  I'm laughing at this point if it's me.  I'm laughing.  I'm like, what are you doing?  You're like, this is silly.  This is really silly.  So what do you do next?  You just kind of pull on the nipple clamps.  Taser is a yam bag.  And what does he do, scream for more, or does he have to, what?  Sometimes he'll scream for more, yeah.  And what are you saying? 
[00:12:30]  You're a bad boy.  Yeah.  I'm going to fuck the FedEx guy.  Yeah.  There's a five-car pileup on the LIE.  Ow.  That one sounds like it hurt.  So what do you do?  So do you have a feather, too, or something?  Actually, I do.  And then I also have, like, a few lips.  You got a crop, a riding crop?  Are you cropping across his belly or something?  You know what?  Next time you're in town, I'll just bring the equipment in and you can look at it.  Good idea.  Hey, do you smack his penis with the riding crop a little? 
[00:13:00]  A little bit, yeah.  You've done this before, haven't you, Norton?  No, I'm just very familiar with it.  I'm not really a submissive, to be honest.  You're a dominant?  I don't know what I am.  I just don't want to be tied up.  You're a pervert.  Yeah, I'm just filthy.  John wants to know if you used a ball gag on him.  No.  Like the gimp?  No, okay.  Not the gimp.  No.  So, all right.  He's got the nipple clamps, he's got the feather, you're pulling on the nipple clamps  a little bit.  What else?  Yeah, just a little bit of, like, you just talk kind of rough.  What do you say?  I'm not good. 
[00:13:30]  I invited Zed over to fuck him in the ass.  I can't.  Yeah, give us some of the dialogue.  No, I can't.  You've got to.  Give us some of the Dee Dee dialogue.  Here I am.  I'm kind of.  Ooh, I can't move, Dee Dee.  Ow.  Oh, those clips hurt.  Now what do you do?  Come on, Dee Dee.  Come on.  I'll just tell him to shut his whining.  Shut your fucking whining.  Whoa.  And then what do you do?  I can't do this.  Stop whining.  Yeah, what do you do now?  Stop whining.  Because I'm still whining.  I'm hoo.  I can't.  How do you say stop your whining?  I say stop your fucking whining. 
[00:14:00]  Stop whining.  Really?  Stop whining.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stop it.  And then he gets fake scared, right?  Well, he acts like he's really scared.  Quiet.  You think he's faking it?  And then that gives you a little power, right?  Yeah.  And it gets you even more moist.  Yeah.  And now we're having fun.  Oh, my God.  Stop whining.  And then do you climb aboard?  I guess you could say that, yeah.  I'm aboard.  All aboard.  All aboard, everybody.  All aboard.  And then eventually you let him go and he just has his way with you, right? 
[00:14:30]  Then what happens at the end?  Oh, what do you think happens?  Use your imagination.  But do you let him go and then he has his way with you or do you just ride him that way?  For a while, yeah, sure.  I do that.  I can't.  Then you untie him and are you then a little submissive?  Yeah, and then I'm the submissive one.  You're on the bottom?  A little bit of role of playing.  Bottom, top, or both?  What do you like?  A little bit of both.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did he spank you?  Of course he did. 
[00:15:00]  All right, this is the fast round.  Come on, guys, because she only has like 30 seconds.  Okay, you know what?  How many times did you come?  Let's just say we were both very happy numerous times.  Numerous times, okay.  Come on, I had my whole weekend here.  What does he say to you when he spanks you?  Yeah, what does he say to you when he spanks you?  You bad girl, you.  Yeah, you like that.  You like that.  Well, we use the F word a lot.  You tell me about all the cock you suck when I'm not here, you bad girl.  Hold on, keep talking, Opie. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, Opie.  Yeah.  You'd be good at that.  You go pass out and marry some English counterfeiter.  Yeah, you bad girl.  Actually, never mind.  That counterfeiter is an asshole.  Well, what else?  Come on, Dini.  Um, you know.  What does he say to you, sweetie?  Yeah, what does he say to you?  He might be with me.  Good.  This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you.  Yeah.  I told you to do better in your studies. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, do you role play?  Do you make believe you're a little girl or anything like that with him?  Sometimes I'm a little girl, yeah.  Well, with the voice, you know.  How old?  Yeah, the voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How old?  High school, college.  What a rookie.  College?  Can you play one?  You want me to be a little girl?  All right, so you're like a high school girl or a college girl, and what is he?  Okay, he likes me to say, I've been bad, Daddy.  Whoa. 
[00:16:30]  I knew he'd get to that.  Okay, I got to go.  How do you say it, Dini?  You don't say it.  How do you say it?  I've been bad, Daddy.  I can't.  Jesus.  I got it out.  You got me to say that much.  So he spanks you, and you say, I've been bad, Daddy?  I've been very bad, Daddy.  And then you look down, and he's throbbing at that point.  But I don't snort.  You can barely get Daddy out before he just goes, oh.  So when he spanks you, do you say, like, I've been bad, Daddy.  I'm the sheriff. 
[00:17:00]  No.  Okay, you know what?  Next time when you guys are in town, I will bring some stuff in.  I've been bad, Daddy, huh?  I've been bad.  Very bad.  Like what?  What have you done?  I just say it.  No, no.  And then he goes, well, why are you bad?  You know, I have to go do a report.  Daughter?  Yeah.  I have to go do a report.  Whenever you're having age play, you tell her that she's your special girl.  What?  You're my special girl.  That's what you do when you're having Daddy-daughter age play. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, really, Jimmy?  Yeah.  You know that?  My special girl.  Sure.  Special.  You're my special girl.  That's right.  Could you put on a little pink tango hat?  Go missing?  I have to go do a report.  No?  All right, Didi.  Didi's got to do some traffic, everyone.  Sorry.  All right, Didi.  Someone called for and go missing?  Oh, yeah.  I've been getting emails from some of your listeners.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're a cordial bunch. 
[00:18:00]  And?  Oh, they just want to know if I snort while I have an orgasm.  No.  Yeah, do you?  No.  No?  Maybe if he cracks a joke in the middle of it, you'll...  So, Daddy spanked you, does he?  Yes, he does.  Nothing bad.  Does he put it in while he spanks you?  Well, what do you think?  Yes.  I don't know.  It depends.  A lot of people would separate those things.  And then you start yelling that you're going to be good from now on?  That type of thing?  Yeah.  I've got to go. 
[00:18:30]  No, you don't.  No.  Yeah, I do.  I have to go do a Chicago, Dallas, and Minnie.  Yeah.  Tell them you've been bad, too.  I've been bad, Minneapolis.  Yeah, you should shock the hell out of the people that are stupid enough to listen to those dumb traffic stations.  Traffic is so bad.  It's not dumb.  That's...  Yeah, you want an audience on the traffic stations.  Ant's on to something.  Traffic's naughty.  It's so bad.  Traffic is bad, Daddy.  Traffic is bad.  Yeah.  It's all backed up.  Yeah.  Don't go through that tunnel.  It's wet and slippery. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God.  Nope.  All right.  Well, you guys have a good day.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  You too.  All right.  She's going to do traffic, everyone.  But next time you're in town, I'll bring some stuff in.  Yeah, bring your toys.  Give me a notice.  Dee Dee, you've been so bad.  I've been very bad.  Very.  Very bad.  Very bad.  I've been very bad.  I've been very bad.  I've been very bad with Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Thank you, perfect diction.  Go do traffic.  Hey, Norton. 
[00:19:30]  Okay, bye.  Bye.  Satin.  Satin.  There's so much more to her.  Yeah.  She's a filthy girl.  We're just scratching the surface there.  Hi, this is Chris Griffin, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, just like  me.  I like bad stuff.  In my mouth.  Your mom's box.  Thank you for the huge banana.  It's not the same vibe.  Oh, my God.  The banana's got weight to it.  Dude, he doesn't like big bananas. 
[00:20:00]  I hate the big banana.  Mustache guy.  I hate the big banana.  Can you get mustache guy in here?  But, you know, because now I've got to peel it and break it up and eat it.  Why don't you explain to the new intern that you don't like the really big bananas, Anthony?  Is this the only banana they had, sir?  It was a bunch, but I grabbed the first one that came to my hand.  First one that came on your hand?  This is a big banana, isn't it?  Did they have any smaller ones?  I think that was about all the sizes they had.  If you want me to go down and get another one, that's cool. 
[00:20:30]  See, because sometimes, like Nathaniel, when he has to go, he'll get two smaller bananas,  because he knows my phobia to big, thick, meaty, nine-inchers.  There's only one way the intern's going to learn.  Anthony needs two small bananas for this one, okay?  Thank you, mustache guy.  I wouldn't send him back.  Yeah, but he's got to learn.  He's got to learn.  And hurry up, because Anthony gets hungry this time of the morning.  And bring me one, too, a big one, but not that one.  Jimmy, hold on, hold on. 
[00:21:00]  Tell him Jimmy's just kidding.  No, I want one.  Is he kidding?  Yeah, he's kidding.  Okay.  Can he hear me out there?  Can he hear me out there?  Yeah, I know, I know.  Is he out the door?  No, he's in the other studio.  Oh, it's taking him so long.  I need my bananas.  He needs his banana.  Hurry up.  Please.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  XM202, the Opie and Anthony show.  Bob Kelly breaks his leg. 
[00:21:30]  This is how it all began, this little storyline.  Live from Torgasm, we find out that Bob Kelly broke his leg playing football.  Bob sounds like he's heavily medicated.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Because Dane Cook woke him up.  He called in and then decided to wake Bob up.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Pop off.  Hey, Dane.  Yo.  Dane Cook, everyone.  There he is.  A very, very funny comedian.  He's on tour with Bob Kelly.  Who else there, Dane?  We got, let's see, Gary Goleman and Jay Davis on this tour bus coast to coast. 
[00:22:00]  Right now, Bobby's actually out of commission.  But, you know, last night we were on this bus and we took a hard left.  And I'm not just saying this.  I've got to be honest.  It was like being on the Titanic.  Yeah, the bus.  I got a little jostled.  It was just like being on that Metallica bus back in the day.  It really was.  Yeah.  I felt like Cliff Burton back here being thrown around.  How did Bob hurt himself?  Did he hurt his back bending over and tying his shoes with a fat stomach? 
[00:22:30]  Like, we stepped into this camping area and we were just, you know, going to have a little  food, maybe play a little football or something.  And we decided, because we're idiots, we decided to play football on a fucking field where it's  not only uneven, you know, terrain, but there's like rock.  It's like a quarry, basically.  So, Bobby being fucking, you know, trying to be a QB when he doesn't even know how to 
[00:23:00]  hold a ball, he's out there, he's running around and he's, you know, he's being silly.  And then he goes, dude, I'm going to run out.  I want you to lateral it back.  You're going to throw it back to me.  And a couple of the guys on the crew, because, you know, we had to do this thing really cheaply.  You know, we had to like, you know, pull in a couple of these guys from the Dominican  Republic to handle a camera.  So, Bobby goes up with one of these fucking giant Dominicans.  He gets all tangled up and he comes down and he, his knee, I'm telling you, his knee looked 
[00:23:30]  like a flamingo.  It went completely the wrong way.  Oh.  Yeah.  What an ass he is playing football.  He was screaming.  I've known Bobby 15 years.  He was screaming his perfectly trimmed goatee off.  Okay?  He's on the ground.  We're all around him.  We get him to the hospital.  He, we'll know today, because we've got to bring him to this, we're up near Syracuse  now, but we've got to bring him to an orthopedic surgeon.  But he either tore his MLC or he really pulled it. 
[00:24:00]  But they think he may have torn it.  So, what's going to happen?  They're going to have to put a cast on him, which is going to be good because he's trying  to lose weight.  So, I'm sure that will help just sit there for six months.  That's going to work.  Is that, what will happen with his thing?  They just, what do they do?  Did they fix that?  Do you have to be in a cast for a few weeks?  Yeah, he's actually on the bus up front right now, sleeping.  They got him on some meds.  He's in an air cast.  And then, I don't know exactly what the next step is.  We're going to fight it today.  But they said he should be able to, you know, perform. 
[00:24:30]  He just won't be able to, you know, move.  He's going to be on crutches or something like that.  It's going to be hard to fuck a chair while he's standing on one leg.  You know, he was, Dane, he was so excited about this tour.  It's the tourgasm, right?  Yeah, man.  He was so excited.  Yep.  And now it's going to, you know, let's be honest, it's going to suck for him a little  bit.  Well, the good thing is, I mean, we've got the first couple of weeks have been sick.  I mean, we started off in L.A.  And, you know, we've been filming this thing as a documentary 24 hours. 
[00:25:00]  And it's been great.  You know, in fact, we actually got the accident on film.  Oh, great.  There you go.  We were all watching it last night.  And we were already laughing at fucking Bobby Screamin'.  It was actually pretty funny.  I've never, you've got to hear him screaming.  Oh, we've got to hear that.  Oh, dude.  You know, Dane, you've got to give us that audio just of him screaming.  That's all we want.  Oh, we'll get it.  We'll get it for you guys.  You know, I'm one of those people, I'm pretty twisted. 
[00:25:30]  I'll laugh.  You know, I love violence.  I feel like when somebody gets hurt.  But the minute it happened, I almost puked.  Wow.  Wow, he's really hurt, though.  It was bad.  I feel bad.  Yeah, it was bad.  Can we wake him up, you think?  I tried to get him up a little bit ago, but he's all, you know, wrapped up in his blanket,  you know, with his air cast up in the air.  Do you have any painkillers?  Yeah, he's on meds right now.  So, he's all like, you know, this will be a downward spiral once he gets out of this  one. 
[00:26:00]  Jeez.  That's so bad.  We've got to get him.  Yeah.  Is there any way we could try to wake him up live on the show?  I'll try again.  Hold on one second.  All right.  Hold on one second, dude.  Because Bob will just love us for this one.  Yeah.  Also, Sean Rouse, should we get him in here?  What do you mean?  We're running out of show.  Hold on one second.  Get Sean Rouse in here.  Get him in here, Eric, now.  The boss wants him.  Bobby.  Here we go.  Bobby, you know.  How you doing, buddy?  Yeah.  Bobby, how you feeling?  Oh.  What's up, Bob? 
[00:26:30]  What's up, man?  How you feeling?  How's your knee?  Fucked up, dude.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I get the phone in front of your lips here.  We got O&A.  Do you want to say anything to these guys?  Oh, yeah.  Let me talk to those motherfuckers.  All right.  You're right here, dude.  Thank you, Dane.  Bob.  Bobby.  Bob?  Yo.  What's up, man?  What the fuck, Bob?  You hurt yourself.  Yeah, I know.  I fucked up.  What kind of pain medication are you on right now? 
[00:27:00]  I don't know what it is.  I just...  I don't know what it is, man.  It sounds like it's really fucking you up.  Is it killing the pain?  Yeah, man.  Yep.  Yeah, I took it right away.  Good deal.  Yeah, I fucked it up.  When are you going to the doctor, sweetie?  I'm going...  Hey, Jim.  Hi.  I'm going in, I guess, 45 minutes to see a specialist.  I'm going to go see a surgeon later.  What happened to the knee, exactly? 
[00:27:30]  It went sideways.  My, you know, the bottom part of my leg went sideways.  Yeah, I had the friggin' big Dominican I was playing with.  Yeah.  Fell on my...  Fell...  I was going to take him up in the air, and then he fell.  I fell on that one leg, and I just felt it crack, and then I felt it... 
[00:28:00]  I almost felt like it touched the side of my leg.  Oh, Jesus, I think.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That is awful.  That's really bad.  You know something?  You shouldn't...  Anytime...  Anytime...  You know, ever since I think I was 30, I think ever since I was 30, I never played football  anymore with people, and they go, hey, you want to get together and throw the ball around?  Yeah.  It's something to do when you're in your 20s with your friends.  The second you hit a certain time of your life, Bob, you can't play football anymore. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to give up this, and...  I'm going to...  Yeah, I'm going to fucking...  This sucks ass.  Well, it's...  Go ahead.  They were fucking...  Everybody's been getting hurt.  Gary Gelman almost died in a horseback riding.  Who's Gary Gelman?  Gary Gelman.  He's a tall Jewish guy.  He was on Comedian.  Fucked up.  Last Comic Standing.  Yeah?  What happened to him?  He was on Comedian. 
[00:29:00]  Comedian.  You are really fucked up, man.  You're messed up, dude.  He's not even remembered talking to us.  What happened?  What happened on the horse?  He was on like a Clydesdale, because he's 6'4".  And when these dumb horses, when they go back, they all go back.  So this horse started galloping, and it just took off at like 90.  Oh, jeez. 
[00:29:30]  90 on the horse.  And it was like...  And Matt fell off the horse.  It was like a fucking horror show.  Yeah, but do you...  Bobby, do you...  Because the guys were saying that you got hurt, but do you think that because of that  thing yesterday?  What thing?  The thing, bro.  Jesus.  What's wrong with you?  Huh?  Are you going to have to because this is going to start?  Are you what?  Ah, you fucking jizzbucket, Jordan. 
[00:30:00]  Don't be fucking to fall off a cliff and...  So where are you guys?  Ladder under the sidewalk.  There's a water balloon.  Where are you guys?  We're on the bus right now.  Where?  Here.  Where?  Where?  You're kidding.  Bob hurt his leg.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  I was just talking to him. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, but his leg.  But the comedy toy.  Where?  You poor fuck, man.  I feel bad for you, Bob.  Oh, you fucking...  You fucking douche.  Dude, Bobby, what's going to happen if you have to come off the tour besides ticket sales  going through the roof? 
[00:31:00]  The poor guy is bedridden, and you can't let up on him.  Oh.  I tell you, I wish I was there.  Is this wrong?  I want to be there with Bob while he's all doped up and helpless, and just jerk him off  against his will.  He's limp on to his side as he's going, stop it, stop it, stop it. 
[00:31:30]  But his body gives him away.  He's saying stop, but he's pushing his hips forward.  He comes, he straightens his leg, he re-tears his little leg muscle.  Tightening his ass cheeks.  Just sit on the end of the bed and jerk him off and talk to him.  Oh, he's slamming me.  Oh, that's horrible.  Oh, Bob. 
[00:32:00]  Unbelievable.  What's the, uh, did you, did you, did the doctor see it or anything, or today?  He goes in, like, 45 minutes.  Yeah, but shouldn't you have gone to an emergency room?  I did, I did.  They took x-rays just to make sure it's not broken.  So what, did you tear some of those, uh, connecting things?  Yeah, something shit.  That's why I'm going to see another doctor today.  Wow.  And then, um, and then, uh, I got to play, uh, we're going to do paintball around 4 o'clock,  so.  Oh, yeah, good luck with that.  We're going to do what? 
[00:32:30]  Paintball.  Good luck with that one.  A little paintball.  We'll take one to the knee.  It really is.  They're just going to, they're going to put me next to the flag and throw camo all over me.  I just have to guard the flag.  Brilliant.  Unbelievable.  If you go out on that field, you're a nut.  You cannot play paintball.  Does he look like Colonel Kirch just sitting there with his camo all over him?  Waiting for Dane to come over and chop his head off?  But they cannot write fuck on their tour bus because it's obscene. 
[00:33:00]  That's great.  All right.  Well, Bob, you got to let us know what happens today, okay?  All right.  I'll call you guys, man.  We're going to let you be.  All right.  I'll call you later.  Here's Dane.  He wants to tell you bye.  All right.  Look for the stunning conclusion of this tour when it plummets off a cliff into a lake.  Right.  Jesus.  Yo.  Hey, Dane. 
[00:33:30]  What's up?  That's some good radio right there, pal.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  No problem.  No problem at all.  You should see this kid right now.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Is he really going to play paintball with you guys later?  Yeah.  We're just going to give him a bucket of paint to throw at somebody.  How great would it be if Bob lost an eye playing paintball?  He goes back blind and a blind gimp.  I'm blind. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, poor bastard.  All right.  Well, take care of him.  Yeah.  Are you guys going to come in here or what?  Yeah.  I mean, hopefully if we can get through there, we'll bring the gimp in.  That'd be great.  And, Dane, you're filming this for a DVD?  Yeah.  We're doing this for a DVD and just, you know, we're doing 20 university shows cross-country.  So, we've been filming all the shows.  Shows have been killer.  Shows are sick.  And when we're all done with this debacle, then we'll put it all together and see where it goes. 
[00:34:30]  He said the shows have been packed, man.  Where are you guys tonight?  The next show, we're up in Syracuse.  We're doing two up here.  Wow.  Dane Cook, thanks so much.  Good luck to you guys.  All right, guys.  Later.  See you next time.  See you next time.  There he goes, Dane Cook.  I'd love to hurt Bob Kelly.  Get a copy of that DVD when they're done.  That disaster.  It's going to be like watching Platoon.  Do it for Dane and Bobby.  Hey, this is Terry Jones here of Multipython, and you're listening to Opie and Antony. 
[00:35:00]  Your bananas are here.  Oh, my bananas are here.  Let me see.  All right.  Are these keepers?  Oh, hey.  I think you did a good job.  See how bananas.  See how those bananas don't look like, you know, huge schlongs.  I like them to look like adolescents.  Yeah.  So he still gets the nutritional value of one big one, but he doesn't look weird eating  it.  Yeah, but it doesn't hurt going in.  So there you go.  Thank you.  No, Bob.  I've got to thank Nathaniel. 
[00:35:30]  Why?  Why do you have to thank Nathaniel?  I put a second decision in helping.  What?  Oh, he told you where to go?  Yeah, I kind of cheated him a little bit, but, you know, I had to call him up for a split-cision.  Split- split.  Oh, my God.  A split-cision?  A split-cision.  A split-cision.  A split-cision.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  So thanks to Nathaniel for the split-cision.  Why are you carrying that in your pocket?  That big banana.  They wouldn't take it back.  Oh, they wouldn't take the big banana back?  Leave it here.  But I need you to, I want a bagel, a covered bagel with a little bit of cream cheese, please. 
[00:36:00]  Where are you going to send them for the bagel with you?  Where are you going?  Don't go to that place downstairs.  I hate that place.  No, I don't go to pick a bagel either.  I'd take that once.  Yeah, food poisoning.  Starbucks?  I don't like their bagels.  They're never soft enough.  Let's go.  Give me a bagel.  There's a deli on 7th and like 50...  56th that has good bagels.  Cream cheese on the side.  7th and 56th.  Right around there, yeah.  It's right, but don't get one right around here, man. 
[00:36:30]  Seriously, I don't like these.  All right.  All right, make sure he's leaving the...  Make sure he knows, too.  Oh, my God.  It's 10 degrees out.  10 degrees out.  Boy, you would be really good at being a prick, man.  Yeah.  You would be really good at it.  I can't even do that.  I'm just hoping that the cold will freeze that awful little cancer mustache off. 
[00:37:00]  Doesn't he look like Babu from the Seinfeld episodes?  Oh, that's what it is, yeah.  Babu.  Oh, Babu.  You're a bad man, Jedi.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  XM202, the Opie and Anthony show.  Eh, eh, eh.  Eh, eh.  Sandy.  Eh, eh.  Sandy Cain.  Ow.  Sandy Cain on the brand-new Opie and Anthony show has not disappointed at all, Anthony.  No.  Remember, recently she was in and Bob Kelly was here. 
[00:37:30]  And, uh, she was showing Bob Kelly her, uh, her, uh, hemorrhoid.  Hemorrhoid.  Hemorrhoid ass, which we still think is a genital wart, just kind of hanging out back there.  And then she showed the genital wart in the front.  Oh.  And, uh, honestly, I think, I think this is one of the funniest things we've done since, uh, moving to XM.  The video is definitely one of the funniest things.  Yeah.  It's Bob Kelly puking.  And then hobbling out of the studio on his, on his walking stick. 
[00:38:00]  That is the best.  His bad leg.  Him trying to quickly get to the bathroom, but quickly is just a snail's pace because of his gimp leg.  Yeah.  I talked to Bob at the cell the other night.  I was describing it.  And Dan Aderman's eating.  He's like, I can't hear this.  I don't want to hear this.  And Bob is getting, because Bob has a really weak stomach.  Yeah.  Which is amazing for somebody so large to be so weak.  It's like having a giant swimming pool that just bubbles over all the time.  Fat idiot.  Why don't you get some gumption?  Gumption. 
[00:38:30]  Get a little moxie.  A little moxie, Bob.  Well, this is how it all went down.  And then maybe later today you can go to foundrymusic.com or opianathony.com and look at the video.  Because the video is just priceless.  Bob Kelly pukes on the Opian Anthony program.  It's the worst of Opian Anthony.  Do you guys want to talk to Sandy Kane?  Yeah, let's bring Sandy in.  Okay.  She's apparently, I guess, was talking about us on her public access show. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, we're trying to get audio.  She's trolling through the video.  Trying to get audio.  Looking for that audio.  And we'll put that on when...  She just waited for an hour.  Now she has disappeared.  Sandy!  Some of our clips line them up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh!  Anyway!  Oh!  I don't...  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Wow!  Here she comes.  Hey, I'm a boy!  But, uh, you know... 
[00:39:30]  For the black guys.  Ow!  Ow!  Hi, Sandy.  How are you?  Doesn't show the dirt.  Right.  What's the dildo for?  She just likes to show...  It does that.  It rotates and makes her happy.  She's not going to stick anything in herself, right?  It's Mr. Dildo.  Are you?  Yeah.  You said you were going to show us how you use that dildo, right?  Right.  Yeah, Sandy King.  What's wrong with that?  Are you a fag or something?  No, dude, I'm not a fag.  Hey, Sandy.  Do you have any...  Sandy, why don't you pull that mic up toward your face?  Okay, I don't like dildo. 
[00:40:00]  Of course we don't want to see it, Bob, but that's what makes it cool.  No, this is a very...  Because this radio, I totally set up Bob so bad.  This is high-powered.  I put it in Show World, where I used to work.  Yeah.  And the guy remembered me, so...  Remembered you?  That's kind of funny.  If you went in and bought a new dildo, he remembered you.  Right.  He said Ben Dover.  His name was Ben.  Ben Dover. 
[00:40:30]  You're just like Joan Rivers.  That's great.  Very funny.  This is Joan Rivers.  Can we talk?  She doesn't stick a vibrator in her asshole, but I have to.  Sandy, do you have any pictures of you when you were like in your 20s or something?  Anything like that?  I know my brother has a video of me when I was a twirler.  What's a twirler?  I was a major, you know, twirler in my high school.  Wait, no way video of you in high school?  Yeah.  What did they call it then?  Yeah.  What was it, a bird in the camera chipping something on stone? 
[00:41:00]  Did your twirler have two black cocks on the end of it?  There was no video.  Yeah, that was my first.  There was no home video when you were in high school?  Yes, there was.  No, there wasn't.  There was probably film.  There was no videos then.  It wasn't home.  It wasn't home.  How old were you?  What year were you in high school?  Um, in the 60s.  Was it captured on the Dumont network?  Yeah.  A kinescope of her.  Dumont. 
[00:41:30]  Hey, Dumont.  Anyway.  Why is, I gotta interrupt everyone here.  Why is Paris Hilton giving Tony Danza some, oh, a waxing?  All right.  That's the worst.  Tony Danza getting his back waxed.  Yesterday he was in a dunk tank.  Ew.  You're supposed to breathe in and then scream when they pull?  Yeah.  And she forgot to tell me that for a whole ass cheek.  Why are you getting your ass waxed?  Why are you getting your ass waxed?  Because I have, why do you think?  Because I have no idea why you, I didn't have hair.  Did some guy in the rest area complain? 
[00:42:00]  I had wispy, I had some hair, like not a bunch, but I had hair on my ass, and I'd rather  have either my ass hairy or no hair, not just mediocre little wisps like a balding  Jewish guy's head.  I wanted, no, but who was, who was looking at your ass that you really were?  That's what I'm saying.  I don't even know.  Me.  Me.  I don't even know what my ass looks like.  It's nice.  I couldn't even tell you if they're, shut up, Jimmy.  Well, I know, because of my TV show, because I once showed my hemorrhoid on television.  Yeah.  All right, back to the scene.  He doesn't believe you have one, by the way. 
[00:42:30]  No, but it was really out at that point, and I saw a close-up, I said a close-up on my  hemorrhoid, so they closed up, and it was cute.  He doesn't believe you have a hemorrhoid?  Well, it might not be out right now.  You got to show up.  Well, Twato is out.  Yeah, Twato's out.  Twato's always out.  Twato's always out.  We brought Bob Kelly in here, Sandy Kane, specifically to look at Twato today.  What is it?  There's two things now?  Yeah, she's a hemorrhoid.  Well, she's got a hemorrhoid.  She calls it a hemorrhoid.  But sometimes it...  Can I have a pussy?  Sometimes it runs away. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, start taking your clothes off, Sandy.  Yeah, let's get on dressed, baby.  Yes.  Look at that there, you can't.  Everyone says, cover up.  I went to the ladies' room.  Cover up.  What a body.  Yeah.  For 60, she's got a nice body, though, you know?  Yeah.  Not bad, huh?  Not bad.  I know.  All right.  And you're not so hot yourself.  Not you.  Not you.  Okay.  You are hot.  Okay.  What did I say when she was outside?  I said she looks...  No, Anthony.  I said she looks good for her.  I said she looks good for her.  I said you look good for her.  He didn't say that. 
[00:43:30]  He said she looked like the crib keeper with tits.  I didn't say that.  She's nice tits, right?  I wish I thought of that.  There she goes.  You know, I definitely got pasty tape this time, so...  God, your boobs are in there like mercury.  Right.  Yeah, it looks like they could spill over the top at any time, man.  They are spilling over the top.  I had two bras on, so that's how to make your tits look bigger.  Yeah, if you wear two bras.  If you guys want to make your dicks look bigger, wear two jock straps.  Oh, okay.  My dick is just fine, thank you.  Is it?  Let's see.  Good delivery. 
[00:44:00]  Sandy hasn't seen a cock in a while, I take it.  My father was a milkman.  Yeah.  Boy, did he deliver.  My father was a milkman, really.  Really?  And then he started selling melons.  He sold watermelons and cantaloupes and honeydews.  On a wooden cart down the street?  No, on a truck and in the market.  He was a melon salesman.  So my mother always said,  because you have big tits because you ate a lot of melons as a kid. 
[00:44:30]  So all you girls out there are eating melons.  Everyone else is flat-chested but me because I ate a lot of melons.  A lot of sold melons in the street,  but there was video when she was in high school.  Apparently somebody sold cauliflower in your family as well.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  What's going on with the pasties?  I'm a big cauliflower heir.  I might like my tits up.  I had brought matches just in case.  What do you mean matches?  She does a match trick.  I like my tits up. 
[00:45:00]  She's old school.  She's got the pasties and everything.  It's so old it's new.  And inverted nipples.  But she has these inverted nipples that look like holes have been drilled into her tits,  and she actually takes the match and sticks it inside the inverted nipple.  And lights them up.  Bob, what do you want to see first?  It's a hot show.  Are you out of your mind?  Show her the nipple first.  Is that a dick?  I mean, is that an umbrella or what?  This right here?  Yeah.  It's a walking stick.  That would make a good thing for my twat for my show. 
[00:45:30]  Put this in your twat?  Can I borrow it, man?  Yeah.  Robert Kelly's stick.  If you're going to take it and stick it in your twat, you're keeping it.  Okay.  Show him the nipple first, Sandy.  He wants to see your nipples.  Yeah.  Yeah, show the nipple.  Okay, so show my nipple?  Yeah.  But I have pasties on.  So take them off.  Oh, okay.  You know, you're a really good director.  Yeah.  He gave me a breast exam last night.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Bob, you want to feel a breast?  No.  No.  Are you sure?  Yeah, I'm trying.  He had rubber gloves on.  By the way, as Sandy gets rid of her bra and stuff, you know that you weaseled your way 
[00:46:00]  into our penthouse interview?  Take the bra.  Oh.  Get the penthouse.  No, Hustler.  I mean the Hustler, right?  Geez, that's going to make the Hustler people happy.  It's the same magazine.  We've got an interview with Penthouse coming out soon, too.  Oh, those are great.  Great, man.  Great.  I'll be the first one to buy it.  Look at that.  I'm so excited, man.  What do you think?  I'm not that bad.  I'm not that bad.  That's what you want to hear when a girl gets naked for you.  That's not that bad.  They move like your kneecap does now.  Look, dude, they're not that bad for getting a discount at the movie theater. 
[00:46:30]  I mean, those are nice.  Thanks a lot, Robbie.  Hey, Keith Richards' body, take that pasty off so we can see your nipples.  Oh.  Would you like to see me light my tits up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Robert, man?  I guess, yeah.  Light them on fire, honey.  Why don't you turn the lights out?  It looks really good.  Okay.  All right, turn the lights off.  It'll help everybody.  Yeah.  I look better in the dark.  Turn that one off over there.  Make me jealous.  Please let the wick go up.  It's for you, Jim.  I know.  It's a grand treasure, man.  It's a grand treasure. 
[00:47:00]  Can you pull the microphone up while you're talking to us?  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  No.  All right.  We're getting video of this, and we'll get it up on our website.  Oh, great.  We're taking wooden matches.  Yeah.  Man, you think this is easy being made?  I believe you thought she should have been aborted.  I really enjoyed it.  People say, doesn't it hurt?  It feels good.  Here come the pasty.  Look at those awful nipples.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Hey, baby.  It's all right.  If I saw your dick, I might say the same.  I doubt it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I really doubt it. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  You can never tell with a man how big his dick is.  Were your tits in a fire?  She sticks a match in the actual place where the nipples should be.  It should be.  There's no actual...  Are you getting that weird tingly feeling in your groin area when you see something that  disturbs you?  How do you have a hole where your nipples should be?  How did you do that?  Because I was meant to light my tits on fire.  God meant for me to do this.  She has a nice camel toe today. 
[00:48:00]  What does that mean?  Nothing.  Anyone have a fire extinguisher full of gas while she does this?  Wouldn't that be great to just squirt it at her and watch her go up?  How great would that be to splash gas on her right now?  Delightful, delicious, and...  Wow.  Did you have your nipples done some...  What's wrong with your nipples?  What's wrong with your nipples?  Where do you want to start?  I was left out.  I just stick it out.  They're very teeny tiny.  The worst.  So you can't even see them.  I can't even drink my coffee.  All right.  Bye, guys.  What? 
[00:48:30]  What?  All right.  That's very good.  I like this.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  Sometimes you really feel like two pieces of meat.  Well, that's amazing.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We want you to show...  You've got to show the hemorrhoid.  Yeah, turn on the lights, because we've got to make sure the area is lit up nice for Bob.  The hemorrhoid, you've got to show the hemorrhoid.  Show the hemorrhoid.  Show the hemorrhoid.  Send on Robbie Kelly, baby.  Ow!  No, did we meet in the supermarket?  Yes, we did.  Yes.  In the supermarket?  Yes. 
[00:49:00]  Remember?  Yeah.  That's you?  Yeah, you were feeling the melons, and I said, hello.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You were by the melons.  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember that.  So I said, hey, I got melons here.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing, like, um...  That's the latest craze?  Those panties?  Boy short panties.  Those are the hot pants or whatever?  They're awful.  I thought those pants couldn't have looked better.  Those would look better on Lee J. Cobb.  All right, why don't we get Robert Kelly close to...  Lee J. Cobb. 
[00:49:30]  Robert Kelly, you're going to have to limp over there, because you've got to get a close-up.  I don't know what you want.  What happened, man?  We've all looked at it.  I got 20-20 vision.  You just got to sit.  You don't have to touch it.  You just got to look, though.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to.  Robert, I'm sorry, baby, but that show, babe, if she's apologizing about her hemorrhoid,  it must be bad.  It's cute.  It's not even out today, I'm sure.  Oh, you're going to show...  If I would have known, I would have had Mexican food.  Oh, where should Bob go?  Huh?  Yeah, I think Bob should be to your right, Jimmy.  Dildo, man. 
[00:50:00]  Right to the right of Jimmy.  You like him or what?  Jimmy, help him with the microphone for his reaction.  Don't be a dick, Dildo.  Robert, grab that mic.  That's yours now.  Jimmy's moving over there.  My protection.  My bodyguard.  All right, Sandy, focus.  My side dick.  Focus.  Focus.  Focus.  Okay, thank you.  All right, show him the hemorrhoid in the back door first.  Stand over and show him the yellow.  Do you have any music, maybe?  Any music she could dance to?  Anything she could dance to?  I love dick.  You can do that I love dick. 
[00:50:30]  Look at the bush.  I love how the bush comes out the side of that.  Look at that.  That's Twato's side.  All right, don't show Twato yet.  On television, I usually, you know...  You favor the other side.  I don't like the show Twato, but on this show, it's a must.  It's a must on this show.  I mean, I think...  Doesn't it look like Larry Fine's head?  That's great.  The pubic fucking schedule of the Yeti.  Hey, I'm warning you.  All right, we got some music for you to dance.  Hey, I got a growth on my head, Mo. 
[00:51:00]  Are you turning off the lights there, Danny?  Turn them back on, Danny.  All right, we got music for her.  Sandy came to dance to.  Okay, good.  Here we go.  All right.  All right, the music's playing.  Are you ready?  I'm ready.  I think I'm going to cure you.  Cure me of what?  Whatever that's wrong over there.  This will cure you.  Tells the crimp.  My name, Roy.  My asshole will cure you.  What do you mean cure me?  Whatever is wrong.  Turn around.  Turn around.  You can't see my asshole.  Magic, Roy.  When you see my asshole, you'll be cured. 
[00:51:30]  You got to bend over and open it up, though.  Yeah, you got to spread them now.  Take a look.  Look down there.  Oh, no.  Bob's throwing up.  Get him a garbage pill.  He's in the garbage.  Look, Bob.  Look up there, Bob.  Look, look, look up.  Oh, Bob's throwing up.  He's leaving the studio.  Bob's cured.  Bob.  Down goes Bob.  Down goes Bob.  His face was feet red.  Fear factor here.  We got the fear factor.  His face was feet red, and he ran out of here, clutching that cane. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, Eric.  Dragging his leg.  Hey, Eric.  You want to take the thing of vomit with you?  Yeah, get the dude fucking out of here.  He grabs the camera and leaves.  Holy shit.  Boy, the vomit smells.  What is this?  He's beautiful.  What a man.  Oh, my God.  What a man.  You made him vomit.  What a man.  Boy, he doesn't have a strong stomach.  Holy shit.  Wait.  Eric can't follow Bob out of the studio.  I'm going to need therapy on this.  Eric, what's going on?  I'm escorting Bob to the bathroom. 
[00:52:30]  He can barely walk, and he's grabbing his face.  Oh, man.  Bob.  Bob, I want to talk to you.  That is the nastiest asshole I've ever seen in my life.  What's the problem here?  He's got a hairy asshole, dude.  So do you, dude.  Get your headphones on so you can listen to what Robert has to say.  Robert.  Yeah.  What was the problem?  You puked a lot, by the way.  Well, what's the problem? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  You all right?  Did you just ask me what the problem is?  Yeah.  Come back in here.  We've got to show you Twato.  I don't want to see Twato, dude.  I don't want to see Twato.  No, that's the, like, you're leaving after the opening act.  You don't have to see Twato.  You've got to see the headliner.  Yeah.  Twato is, honestly, it's just more silly than anything.  I've got to pee.  We actually tricked you.  We tricked you and gave you the horrific one first.  Twato is just kind of just silly.  We've all done it.  Nice. 
[00:53:30]  Twato.  All right.  Hang on one second.  I'm coming back in.  Come on back in.  All right.  Did she put her calls on?  Did she get her shit back on?  Man, just because there was shit in my asshole, that doesn't mean that.  Oh, God, dude.  What was that?  There's video.  Sorry, I didn't wipe.  In the love of God.  I didn't wipe.  Sorry.  We'll have video up on opianthony.com later today.  I didn't get any show on now that Sandy Cain's here.  That has to go up tonight.  No, I'm just saying.  Just because I...  All right.  Robert Kelly is now hobbling back into the studio.  Just because I didn't wash. 
[00:54:00]  You feel better, Bob?  Oh, my nose.  Your face was so red.  Do you need one of us to hold your hand?  I don't need a gynecologist.  I do the O&A show.  Yeah.  You have a bevy of...  All right, Robert, get back on a microphone.  A bevy of people.  Don't be a pussy.  Sorry, baby.  That is the worst asshole I've...  Awful.  What's wrong with my asshole?  I look like my uncle's.  Well, haven't you seen your uncle's asshole?  A couple times.  What are you going to do?  Why?  How did you do that?  He's growing up.  He's got to get money for drugs.  Oh. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know.  Want to take a nice hot girl to Olive Garden?  You got to do what you got to do.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, dude.  That's hilarious.  Oh, God, dude.  Maybe you were fucking your uncle in the ass.  Maybe that's what it was.  Her underwear.  I can't shake her image out of my head.  Isn't that awful?  You healed my knee.  The thing I...  Yeah, you probably forgot about the knee.  Now I got her friggin' that little...  It looked...  Her panties.  The front of her panties is smaller than her pubic mass.  That matted mess in the front. 
[00:55:00]  I have a very big vagina.  It's very big here.  It really is.  I have a very well-and-dad family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My brother and father were very well-and-dad.  Don't ask how I know.  All right.  Sandy, we're going to ask you now.  Sandy.  You better get the girl out.  This isn't bad, though.  No.  This isn't like a fucking...  No.  No, no.  Don't talk into my thing.  You're cute.  No.  No, it's not bad.  All right.  Why don't we get the garbage pail in here just in case?  Yeah, yeah.  It's really...  All right.  Honestly, we've all seen Twado, and it's just kind of silly. 
[00:55:30]  Like I said, it looks like an ear.  She have to wake it up?  No.  It just sticks right out.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you do the big reveal...  Anthony, you want to explain how big this thing is again?  I guess you said it.  I guess you're right.  Yeah.  It's self-explanatory, but it's just to the left of her area there.  Sandy, if you would...  Bob, if you would just take the camera.  Can I have a drum roll?  Yeah.  Is there a drum roll here?  No.  No drum roll?  No.  We don't do those. 
[00:56:00]  That's kind of hacky.  We would do it as a goof, but...  Oh, you guys...  This is really...  Are you ready, Robert?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on Fear Factor.  You will be cured again.  Really?  I'm telling you.  It might take a day or two.  Is it bad?  No.  It's good.  Turn down the music so we get the reaction here.  Some men love it.  What is it I'm looking at?  Some men love it.  A genital wart.  We think it's a genital wart.  But she says it's not.  She says it's not.  What do you think it is?  Well, um...  Have you gotten it checked out?  Oh, she said...  Oh, she said...  They had a doctor show.  Hold on.  She said that... 
[00:56:30]  Don't show it yet.  Hide it then, stupid.  Yeah, hide it.  She said...  Stick it out.  Does it have a name?  Dude, it's stick straight out.  It'll pop right out.  The thing is, she says that she was shaving, she nicked herself, and then this thing started  growing.  It grew.  That's what happens.  That's what happens.  Now, and then I was...  Being a naked dancer, it's really been weird, because at Show World, I had to dance naked,  and there was this growth on me.  So it's really been...  You know, remember the time I put a...  It's like a shave of a heart. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, she painted it red once.  Yeah, it's like a shave of a heart.  And some guy came in on Ron and Fez's show.  And nibbled on it.  And nibbled on it.  And put it between his lips and started sucking on it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's like, all right?  Yeah.  Are we ready?  Like a calcium deposit, like under your grandmother's armpit, that type of thing?  No, it could be.  Something like that.  How do you know your grandmother's armpit?  All right, Sandy, turn to Robert Kelly and reveal Quato.  Reveal Quato.  For the first time for Robert Kelly. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, my...  Oh!  Here we go.  Look at it, look at it!  Look at me here!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my...  Look at it!  Oh, look at it.  Look at it.  It's the nastiest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.  Look at it.  It's a genital wart.  What is it?  It's a big, nasty genital wart.  Keep it out.  Don't put it away.  Put it out.  Pull it out.  Pick it up a little.  Slick it.  Slick it.  Ah!  Oh, no, there he goes.  He's...  He's got a gimp out of here with a cane. 
[00:58:00]  He hobbled out like he's 80.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm never having this removed.  Oh, if it was a general wart,  wouldn't I be sick or something?  Wouldn't I be sick with a general wart?  Well...  I don't know, okay.  I got you.  Gear factor.  Who's this?  It's our, he's thrown up in the toilet.  Listen, listen.  Shh, shh, shh. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, he dropped his cane.  Oh, fuck.  Fuck it, lift it.  He really can't take this off.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Robert, what's the problem?  Oh, fuck.  That is the nastiest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, shit.  All right, Bob, what the hell is that?  It's a genital wart.  It's a genital wart.  You hearing all this?  Yeah.  Oh, God, what is that fucking thing?  Why did she get that removed? 
[00:59:30]  I don't know why she doesn't get it removed.  And not have a, you know, and not have a great show.  Oh.  Yeah, of course.  The beautiful thing is the way the panties are right now.  No, leave it, leave it.  It's half, it's kind of the panties are resting on it and it's sticking out of the panties.  Oh, half of it is out of the side of the panties.  Oh.  Look at the hair on one bush.  It's gotten bigger, too, man.  I know.  Oh.  What's wrong with hairy bush?  You don't like hairy bush?  You like a shaved?  There's a medium.  There's somewhere between that and shaved. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  It looks like your vag is going through chemo or something.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's all spotty, Bob.  Spot?  Oh, God.  Would you like a shaved bush or hairy?  Your pussy looks like Dan Haggerty's mouth.  Awful.  I saw her pussy on film once.  Some guy fell off a horse up in the Pacific Northwest and filmed it walking through the woods.  In 1967.  He's saying he can't come back in.  He's coming back in.  That's what it looks like.  It looks like one of those plaster casts of a Sasquatch footprint. 
[01:00:30]  Sasquatch foot.  You have Sasquatch foot on your vag.  Your vag.  Well, that's why, I mean, that's why I don't shave anymore because that's what happened.  No, that's really what happened.  Yeah.  Because I just don't know.  If it was a vaginal wart, wouldn't I be sick or something?  Right.  Why don't you do something with a dildo today?  Oh, what are you going to do with a dildo?  Bob's got to be in here for this.  Yeah, Bob, don't tell him though.  Don't tell him.  What are we going to do?  Oh, man.  What a soft stomach.  What a weak stomach he has. 
[01:01:00]  Well, I thought I would sing a song and stick the dildo in.  Because I have a song called Shove It Up Me, Opie and Anthony.  All right, let's do that.  Oh, okay.  Shove it up.  I like that.  Shove it up me.  You got the music for this?  Yeah.  On cassette?  On a cassette.  Sandy.  Are you insane?  I know.  I'm old.  It's the 21st century.  I know.  Compact disc.  I happen to like cassettes.  There it is.  How long will it take, Nathaniel?  Or can you play it from in there, maybe?  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  I really brought two songs for you.  That I did them both on my show to say thank you for coming home.  Coming back.  Right.  We have audio of you talking about us on your public access show, right?  Yeah, that's right.  It's all good, I hope.  Why don't we listen to this?  And Jim Norton, too.  Why don't we listen to a little of this just as they cue up your song for you, okay?  We're going to have a hot show tonight, man.  You know who's on?  Opie and Anthony is on.  We've got a pastor from the Times Square Church. 
[01:02:00]  I mean, I did an Opie and Anthony show the other day.  And thank you, ONA, for inspiring this show.  I did this song on XM for Opie and Anthony.  I think she was on television.  Yeah, she's naked.  You're naked and you move your boobs around, right?  Yeah.  Not yet. 
[01:02:30]  Can we get the video of this for our websites?  I would love to see the video of it.  Yeah, that is really bad.  I'm doing AR back here.  Yeah.  Oh, my name is Beth.  On XM Satellite I showed up my ass crack.  EYLA, EYLA, my boyfriend back here. 
[01:03:00]  I'm so glad Opie and Anthony are back here.  EYLA, EYLA, my boyfriend back here.  I showed my fucking hemorrhoid in my fucking ass crack.  EYLA, EYLA, EYLA, my boyfriend back here.  I think public access is supposed to be to serve the public interest.  Yeah, of course.  It's not late night.  It's there just to let people go on and educate people.  Well, educate that you're back.  Okay.  Do you have a crew?  Do you have a crew? 
[01:03:30]  Of course.  And a camera guy?  Of course.  And sound people?  And a director.  And what do they think?  Just as long as they get paid, they don't care.  I've checked out the show.  It's kind of funny.  Yeah.  That actually doesn't look bad the way you're dressed.  Leave it like that.  Just don't do it the way you're dressed right now.  Look, is that Bobby?  Robert.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  His eyes are tearing.  He's going gay.  He's going gay.  Going gay?  I'd rather suck a cock that size.  She's got her clothes on.  She's not naked.  But look at the way.  Seriously.  Yeah, just look, Robert. 
[01:04:00]  I'm not.  I can't see it.  Robert.  Someone wants to know if you puked up your pain pills.  All right.  All right.  This is what's going to happen here.  I guess we got her latest song queued up.  All right.  The one she wants to play.  Let's go shove it up.  O and A.  All right.  O and Anthony.  All right.  Robert, watch.  And we're doing this for you to make you feel better about your knee.  Really?  You couldn't get the times you have two leg bands in here?  No.  Yeah.  You're sticking shit in the quads?  You're unappreciative.  Oh, really?  Yes, you are.  Triple X.  This is triple XM. 
[01:04:30]  We set this whole thing up for you.  Look at the way it's sticking out of the panties.  I'm not looking at that freaking lobe.  I'll just show my pussy in a second if you're hey.  All right.  And then everything will stink.  You got to take them down so you can do them.  Oh, yeah.  I just feel a little shy.  Hey, my direction.  You got to take them down.  You got to take them down.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't be shy.  Well, I just feel a little bit.  I need a little something on.  There's a little self-conscious.  Yeah, thank you.  Trust me.  You can be completely...  If you take your dick out, I'll take them down.  Dude, don't.  Listen, listen. 
[01:05:00]  Just pull them down.  Take your dick out, I'll do it.  And I'll do it, all right?  I swear to God.  Trust me.  No one cares.  I care.  All right.  I'm getting hot.  I'm getting hot.  All right.  Should we start your song?  Sandy, should we start the song?  Yeah, why not?  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the body of a 20-year-old on Jupiter.  Robert, you better be a good sport and watch the performance.  You have to, Bob.  This is for you.  It's all for you.  All right.  This is for you, Robert, baby.  You're going to be cured after this.  Here we go.  Here's the song.  Either that or kill yourself.  All right.  Here's the debut.  You got a disorder.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Here's the debut of the brand new Sandy Kane song. 
[01:05:30]  Shut up.  Wait, Bob can't sing.  Oh, this is a different song, but I can't.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What song is that?  This is good, though.  This is really great.  No, we're running out of show.  We want to debut the other one.  So it's the other song on there?  Well, that one's a fast one, though.  It's a really good song.  It's dedicated to you guys.  Put your thing down.  You got your clothes on.  You can't have your clothes on for this.  Can I have an orgasm on XM or what?  Yeah, you can.  You have to.  You have to. 
[01:06:00]  It's part of the thing.  It's part of the thing.  You're a naked dancer.  Come on.  I used to be.  Exactly.  Just do it.  All right.  Okay.  It's getting.  You're running out of time.  Okay.  All right.  What are we going to do?  This is just dedicated to you guys.  It's on the tape that I gave you.  Sorry, Rob.  No, I'm sorry, baby.  Are you apologizing for the twaddle?  Or the smell of deli mustard?  This is what Paula Abdul is on.  Painkillers.  Paula Abdul is. 
[01:06:30]  Huh?  It's a second song.  It's awful.  Unless you want to do the first song.  They can't find the other song on the tape.  Do the first song.  Yeah, but this has to be played.  Yeah.  There's a special thing that's going to happen during this song.  Oh.  That fucking OB is so evil.  Oh, man.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  The cell phone's keeping cutting out on one side.  All right.  Will you?  We're trying to find the song.  Derek's having a tough time in there, and he's brilliant at what he does, man.  No.  He was handed this cassette that is from, like, 1982. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Where's the other pasty?  Oh, God.  I hope you find that.  It made a break for it.  Oh, here he is.  You can't replace these.  All right.  We're going to try something here.  You got something?  You can.  All right.  We're going to try this.  Here it is, Sandy Kane.  Sandy, here we go.  Dedicated to Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite.  Right, Bill Dahl.  Nice round of applause, huh? 
[01:07:30]  Shove it up.  Shove it up me.  Shove it up.  Shove it up me.  Shove it up.  Shove it up me.  Opie and Anthony.  Handsome me.  Shove it up me.  Shove it up me.  Shove it up my hair.  Harry pussy. 
[01:08:00]  Can't sing.  Yeah, turn around to Bob.  You got to turn around to see somebody get away.  Oh.  She's shoving it up around.  All right.  We're getting the guards pill, Robert.  Relax.  Wow.  Look at that, huh?  Someone kicked that dildo right into her ass.  Take your panties off.  Wait.  You need to be on mic now.  Take your panties off. 
[01:08:30]  I say, shove it up.  Shove it up me.  Shove it up.  Shove it up me.  Shove it up.  Shove it up me.  My hairy pussy.  Opie and Anthony.  Pull down the pants for the big finale.  Big finale.  Here we go.  Oh, God.  Down.  Down.  Down, girl.  I just feel it's got a shot pulling it down, you know?  All right.  All right.  I'm embarrassed of a shame. 
[01:09:00]  I'm really, my mother's listening.  All right.  My mother gets that sound.  Mm.  I said, shove it up.  Shove it up me.  Jim Norton and Robert Kelly.  Shove it up, Jim Norton and Robert fucking Kelly.  Oh.  She's got eyes for you, Bob.  One side to the other side.  I love you, Bob.  I know it's a thing.  All to the other side.  Shove it up. 
[01:09:30]  Shove it up.  I'm getting hot.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  My pussy loves you.  Oh, God.  We're going to have a gangbang here.  Oh, I love this.  Oh, God.  Bob, take a sip of water.  We're losing Robert again.  We're losing Robert.  We're losing Robert.  Shove it up my hairy pussy and my hemorrhoid asshole, too.  All right.  Hey, Ben's over.  I'll shove it up you.  All right.  Very good. 
[01:10:00]  Does that look like a fucking show?  Shove it up.  Ooh.  Shove it up.  He was kneeling and he could put that in his mouth and it was like a, he said it would have  the tech, like a rubbery texture.  Yeah.  He nibbled on it.  He actually nibbled a little bit.  Robert, get back on mic.  What's wrong with you?  Okay, who wants to smell my vibrator now?  Oh.  Robert was saying outside that that's one of his fetishes.  So why don't you just smell my vibrator?  Just hand it to him.  One of my fetishes, too, is to crack a fucking somebody over the head with my, don't, please,  honey.  Honest to God. 
[01:10:30]  For the love of God.  Dildo, it's nothing personal.  Honey, I know, I know, baby.  No, I'm talking to him, baby.  He easily lives.  Yeah, talk to the dildo.  He's my side dick.  Pull on the side.  I can't see.  Pull on the side.  Pull on the side.  Yeah, Robert, just look at Twado.  One last time.  Robert, just look one more time.  What's the big deal?  What's the big deal?  You're at Twado, man.  You guys are sadistic.  No, it's me.  It's a body, baby.  It's a body.  It's just a body.  Get dental floss, wrap it around that thing, and tie it in a knot until it dies and falls  off.  Maybe I'll take your... 
[01:11:00]  I'm just saying, honey.  Look at it hanging out the side.  Look at it hanging out the side.  Robert, don't...  It hangs out the side.  Don't mention dentistry to her.  That's a whole other problem.  Yeah, it's a whole other problem.  Why?  But, you know, we don't have to get in.  Dentists are evil people.  Yes.  Let's see, I showed it to a dentist, and he...  What?  Anyway.  No, I didn't.  All right.  Sandy, I guess that's it for you today, huh?  Thank you.  Hey, Robert, do you have a picture?  Yeah.  Stand with her, Bobby.  Stand with her.  Yeah, stand with her.  She wants a picture with you.  Oh, good.  Why don't you take a picture? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, take a picture together.  Yeah, why don't you take a picture together, Robert?  You know what, baby?  Yeah, why don't you...  Come on.  Bring her over.  Foreground, background things.  No, why don't you bring her over.  There you go.  Wait, hold the dildo, too, Sam.  Yeah, hold the dildo.  There you go.  There you go.  It's silly.  No.  I like it.  There you go.  No, I'll tell you, a lot of my...  Could you...  Oh, my God, you just pulled her wig off.  I'm sorry.  Jesus.  Hold the dildo up and swing it.  Hold the dildo up and swing it.  She just pulled the wig, so I can swing it off. 
[01:12:00]  She panicked.  Let Bobby smell that thing.  This will be on her TV show.  Oh, my God.  Honey, please don't ever fucking do that.  Please.  I feel like I'm at the Carnegie Deli right now.  He put the dildo right under his nose.  Thank you.  That was in a few holes today.  All right, Sandy Kane, another fine appearance by you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Sandy, how long is your hair under that?  Here?  No, no.  Uh-oh. 
[01:12:30]  It's down to here.  Your real hair?  Yeah.  Why don't you just wear your real hair?  Next time I do the show, I will.  Oh, we've seen her with the real hair.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  Yeah, mm-hmm.  Oh, all right.  My collies match my...  No, but my hair is, like, lighter now, but...  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that's what...  All right, dildo?  Are you satisfied now?  Okay.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Well, Sandy, let's try to get your clothes back on as quickly as possible.  Yeah, why don't we throw the dildo away at this point?  It's...  Put Mr. Dildo away. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  Yeah, the attorney.  And get dressed.  There you go.  That's fantastic.  And another better performance.  Thank you very much, Robert.  My next husband here.  Loved it.  My next husband.  You're going to be having wet dreams about me.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Dude, what's up with the ski mask?  That's nice.  It's what?  It's cold out, huh?  What's going on?  No, I just got Jimmy his bagel, and I had to wear this because it's freaking cold out there.  Where'd you go?  I went to the deli right across from Carnegie, right next to it. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, wow.  That's kind of far.  Wow.  Okay, that's cool.  But there's good bagels there, though, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As long as it's not...  How many blocks is that?  Like one and a half.  It's not that big.  Really?  It's a little further than that.  It's cold out there, and they're long blocks, I think, right?  No, I just kind of got lost.  I'm not familiar with the city yet, that's why.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Works on a grid system.  On my way there, on my way back, I ran over here because I knew where it was.  That's very nice of you.  It's hot.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  It's hot.  Oh, you don't like the... 
[01:14:00]  Oh, no.  I'm not even being...  You don't like hot bagels?  You can't.  You want to...  I should have told you that.  I didn't tell you.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Is it really hot?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone knows Jimmy doesn't like hot bagels.  They toasted it for him, huh?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  That could be a problem.  It's hot.  I know.  That is really hot. 
[01:14:30]  Did you listen to the show at all?  No?  I did.  Because Jimmy hates hot bagels.  That's my fault.  I should have said something.  I'm used to, like, certain guys going.  I should have said something instead of...  I'm not trying to be a jerk.  They all know.  Perhaps, you know, somebody should have said something.  I'll get it next time.  Sorry about that, Jim.  What am I supposed to eat?  The next time might be now, because he needs to eat.  I might eat this.  What is this?  Well, how about you just eat that instead?  The multigrain?  Yeah.  That looks delicious.  Oh, boy. 
[01:15:00]  Would you mind if you just went downstairs, because it's cold outside, and just got you  a bagel, maybe, from downstairs?  I might eat at that deli downstairs.  They wouldn't open...  I went for coffee one time, and they wouldn't open the thing.  It was, like, five to six.  And they're like, we're closed.  We're closed.  I'm like, but I work upstairs.  So I absolutely will not.  I want coffee, too.  Do you want coffee?  Well, he's got to take care of the bagel, I think.  Yeah, you're right.  Would you mind going out and getting him a bagel?  What happens when the bagel just gets cool? 
[01:15:30]  Nah, toast is disgusting.  Bread is not meant to be toasted.  It's just gross.  Bread is never meant to be toasted.  And that's my fault.  I should have said something.  I will take responsibility for that.  Well, all right.  Why don't you give him some more money?  Ugh, how does anybody eat that toasted?  Yeah.  I enjoy it, but I'm weird.  Yeah, I would eat it.  I'd have no problem eating that, but Jimmy's very...  How much was it, man?  It was like 80 cents.  With the cream cheese?  Yeah, on the side.  Oh, okay, here.  Give him a 20-cent tip and let him keep the change on that dollar. 
[01:16:00]  I should have said something.  Next time you'll know.  I didn't say anything.  No, Bob.  You want to write it down?  No, I got it.  All right.  I'm sorry to send you back out there.  It's kind of your ass.  I should have told you.  I didn't, and it's my fault.  Put the mask back on.  What, are you giving him a few more bucks for the cream cheese?  Eric?  Give me mine.  All right.  Sorry.  All right.  Not being a jerk, dude.  I apologize.  There goes the intern.  He's now going to get Jimmy's bagel, and hopefully it's not toasted this time around. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  Sorry, bro.  You live and learn.  Yeah.  There he goes.  All right.  There he goes.  He's heading back out the door again.  It's 10 degrees out there in New York.  Oh, my God.  And I am now feeling bad.  He's gone?  I feel bad.  Me too, especially since I love a toasted bagel.  You are a scumbag.  How do you do that?  I never saw that.  This is delicious.  I never saw that coming. 
[01:17:00]  How do you look at it?  Because I know it's...  I'm like, he goes, it's...  Jimmy pulls it out of the bagel and goes, it's hot.  It's hot.  And I'm like, no, the thing is, it's cold.  It got cold from water.  No, Jimmy puts a whole other spin.  He doesn't like hot bagel.  Oh.  When he's leaving, his head's tilted down.  He's like, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  I said, just do double time.  We're going to go get it now.  Oh, my God.  When he comes back without the coffee, I'm going to go, wait, didn't you hear Jimmy say  he wanted coffee, too?  And then we're going to send him to Starbucks?  Oh, no.  And then I'm going to go, I'm going to just go, you know, maybe you're just not cut out  for this. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, you are horrible.  If you can't get the food orders right.  All right, so we got him to go for another bagel.  When he comes back, he'll go for the coffee.  And then at that point, we need something else.  So start thinking.  I can't be part of this.  I can't do things like this.  Jim's apple.  I got to be good cop.  That's the only way I can do it, because I know it's a bit.  Otherwise, I would feel bad for the guy, but I know it's a bit.  All right, you go into good cop mode.  See, we're tearing down the third wall here.  I'll go to bad cop, no problem.  That's an easy role for me to play.  This is delicious.  Make sure he doesn't see you eating the bagel. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's eating the toasted bagel.  I want him to walk in and see me eating it.  And just say you couldn't wait.  You took too long.  I'm not going to say anything.  I'm just going to tell him what I want for coffee.  I have to explain myself to him and his thin mustache.  He's going to walk in with a bagel and see you eating the bagel you can't see.  Yeah.  If he comes over and gets mouthy, I'll just get his mustache off by going like this.  Dusty.  Hunk his shit under his nose.  It annoys me.  Damn. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, that's awful.  He's going to see you eating it and be fearful and not say a word, but wonder why he had to  go out in the cold and get another bagel.  Let him wonder while he's got me an iced latte.  How many times has he been out?  This is his fourth, easily.  Yeah, it's got to be.  All right.  He's going to be like, sir, please make sure you don't toast that.  Please.  Don't even put it near the toaster.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  XM202, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:19:00]  This bit right here is, um...  Hope you're enjoying the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're enjoying the worst of Jim Norton's ass.  Jesus, Jim.  That was awful.  I kind of like this next one that we're about to play.  Tommy Lee hanging up on us.  A little toddler getting a little too close to the edge.  Oh, it's the Lou Costello movie. 
[01:19:30]  This is self-explanatory.  We're talking to Tommy Lee and...  I don't know.  It just got ugly, unfortunately.  Yeah.  And we had a pretty good relationship with him over the years, but, uh...  I don't know.  Oh, you guys have spoken to him before?  I didn't know that.  Oh, my God.  A bunch of times over the years.  Sure.  Oh, did you talk about the P word?  Yeah, we talked...  Yeah, pool.  We talked about...  We talked about his ex, and he didn't like that too much, and it just got ugly, unfortunately. 
[01:20:00]  Because I would like to have him back on the program in our good graces.  Yeah, me too.  Or good gracious shit.  Why do I think that the interview would go horribly wrong?  Is that hand over there and just getting...  Oh, I know.  Would you do it?  So, Tommy.  What is that noise, guys?  Sounds still send shivers up your spine.  Oh.  You wake up in a cold sweat here in this one, Tommy.  Every time you burp a baby, you snow chlorine. 
[01:20:30]  Jesus.  Hit the sweeper.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lo mas mal de Opie and Anthony en XM2-02.  If you're on hold, stay there, but we've got to go right to the hotline.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy.  Tommy!  Who, me?  Yeah.  Hello, Mr. Lee.  What's up, Tommy?  What's up, guys?  No, we were just talking to everybody about paying for it.  I know.  I heard the conversation.  Yeah, escorts and hookers and stuff.  You, uh... 
[01:21:00]  I have to assume you've done that a couple of times, at least.  I think everyone should own one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When you're Tommy Lee, you don't have to, though.  Yeah, see, that's just it.  You go out, you pick up some chick.  He's a rock star, and he has a mule the size of a small community.  Everyone knows about that.  Everyone's seen that on the tape.  Yeah, that made for some great Thanksgiving viewing, Tommy.  I'm so glad that we get to talk to you today, because I've always wanted to thank you.  We brought that tape to Thanksgiving dinner, swear to God, and watched it upstairs while 
[01:21:30]  Mom and Sis and the aunts were cooking the turkey.  We all went upstairs to see you rail, uh, Pam.  You perverts.  You perverts.  You know something, though?  You're lucky.  You're lucky that you were endowed like that, because it was a big hit.  People saw the tape and went, wow, look at Tommy Lee's hog.  And, uh, you could have been one of those guys, a little puny thing, and then you'd be  going through life embarrassed.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Okay.  You got to be psyched at that gun out there.  Who are you kidding?  Hell yeah.  If I got a 14-incher, I want the world to know.  I'd be happy with six.  Hey, Tommy, I got to ask you.  I saw, uh, I saw Pam on, um, what the hell was she on last night?  CNN?  Larry King.  Larry King.  Why are we even, why are we even talking about the P word?  Because she, she was claiming, uh, I got to go, guys.  Bye.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  He hangs up for talking about Pam?  What a faggot. 
[01:22:30]  What a dick.  All right, Tommy Lee, officially an ass wipe.  Why would he hang up?  Why would he hang up?  You were tooling her, you idiot.  Hey, it got on a video.  You were married.  No one doesn't know.  Why are we bringing up the P word?  He wants to promote some golf tournament.  Wow, that's exciting, radio.  Let's talk about a golf tournament.  Want to talk about her and her goddamn hep?  And the fact that she says Tommy gave it to him?  What, what, what gave it to her?  What, what, what is wrong with these people? 
[01:23:00]  Did Tommy Lee lose his mind?  I didn't see if you were being nasty.  Did he lose his friggin' mind?  He wasn't even happy that we brought up the, the sex tape.  I was complimenting the guy.  I gotta go.  Then go.  Go F yourself.  Have a sense of humor.  You jack off.  Like, anyone wants to hear about anything else that you're doing.  By the way.  You're not exactly at the peak of your music career right now.  We want to talk about the sex you had.  We want to talk about the hep team.  The hep thing, Pam.  Does she have a big C? 
[01:23:30]  The interesting stuff.  Want to ask why you didn't have a lifeguard at the party?  We'll plug your crap.  We'll plug it.  Yeah.  Why don't you stick that mammoth mule in the pool and let the kid climb out on it?  Come on.  Why do, why are we gonna sit there and plug stuff and not get something that would be  worthwhile for this program?  Like, talk about Pam.  He should've used his schlong to separate the shallow end from the deep end in the pool. 
[01:24:00]  Like that thing they put across the pool.  When you hit the throbbing vein, turn back, children.  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm glad this happened today.  It's a perfect example why.  Because a lot of people ask us, a lot of journalists ask us, a lot of listeners, why you guys don't  have more famous people on the show.  That's why.  That's why.  They all have major attitudes.  And they got an agenda.  Well, yeah, they could come on your show, but they will only talk about a stupid golf tournament. 
[01:24:30]  And nobody was being a dick to him.  Like, you weren't saying anything, like, messed up about Pam Anderson.  I just wanted to talk about Pam and the, I saw her on Larry King, and I wanted to comment  on the, uh, hepatitis thing.  Eh, I gotta go.  I gotta go.  Obviously, you're not going to rescue children, are you?  Well, he was being a dick.  He was just a dick.  That's not, oh, that's not Cool Rock or, hey, here's my crib.  Hey, here's where my dogs hang out. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, my dog.  That wasn't Cool Rock or, that was uptight asswipe that doesn't want to, uh, talk about  anything that anyone wants to hear about.  Wants to plug stuff and get off.  Well, it don't work that way on this show.  It does not work that way.  Give and take, it's called.  We used to play that game, and we gave our listeners horrible radio.  Horrible effing radio.  Nothing more.  Hey, why are we bringing up the P word?  No more.  Oh, God disgusts me.  Another rock hero gone. 
[01:25:30]  Gone.  Is it?  Ugh.  Tommy Lee, been through the mill, been at the top of the friggin' rock heap, back down  on the downside of the slide, and you'd think he'd have something to talk about.  There's only been books written about their sex lives and the debauchery that the crew's  been through.  It's known, Tommy.  You went out with Pam.  You were married to the woman.  You had kids with her.  What, what, what is it, a secret? 
[01:26:00]  That's all in the book.  All of a sudden, we can't talk, we can't talk about Pam Anderson?  These celebrities are delusional.  They are effing delusional.  Why do you think you're coming on a radio show to talk about a stupid golf tournament?  There are golf tournaments every day, these celebrity golf tournaments.  And if he would have talked with us, we'd have plugged it like we gave a flying F, too.  We would have given it a good plug.  It would have sounded sincere.  Boy, what a surprise we bring up Pam when she was on Larry King last night.  Last night.  It wasn't like it happened two months ago. 
[01:26:30]  She was blaming you for the hep.  I'd like to go to the horse's mouth and hear the answer, but instead we got the horse's  ass.  Tommy Lee.  Wow, Tommy, you're real brave.  What a rocker.  When he said, I'm out of here, I thought, what a rocker.  Suck it.  I thought he was kidding when he said, I'm out of here.  I thought he was kidding.  So did I.  I thought he was kidding.  Oh, yeah, Vince and Nicky, much cooler when they hung out.  They were talking. 
[01:27:00]  They were talking about the past and their sex lives and everything.  They talked for like two and a half hours.  They answered every single question we threw at them.  Every single one.  He talked about Nicky getting thrown into a dumpster because they thought he was dead  after he OD'd.  He told the whole story.  Yeah.  I think it was in Japan or something.  He OD'd.  And the people that were doing the drugs with him were like, holy S, we just killed a rock  star.  We got to get rid of him.  Threw him in a dumpster.  All the sex stories.  You got to mention the tape, though. 
[01:27:30]  You have to.  It's a very famous porno.  The tape is famous.  He might be tired of talking about it, but you know something?  People still want to hear from him about it.  It's part of, you know, doing what you do, Tommy.  It's part of getting your plugs out.  You got to give a little something first.  I'm not going to sit here.  We're not going to sit here and kiss your ass.  Wow.  Dave is delusional.  Line seven.  I disagree.  What if Ant was on a show and they talked about his wife?  I talk about it all the time, you idiot. 
[01:28:00]  Right here on this radio show.  And she wasn't on Larry King.  And you know what?  Right.  If you were.  All right.  Let's say.  Wow.  You were lucky enough to be on Larry King, let's say.  Right.  You're going there.  You got to think.  Well, some questions are going to come up.  That might be a little uncomfortable.  Right.  Right.  Right.  If my wife was accusing me of giving her hep.  Ex-wife.  Ex-wife.  I would absolutely talk about it.  And Ant wasn't married to another celebrity who was being interviewed on national television.  Yeah.  Well, it's still.  And I've talked about it plenty of times on this show. 
[01:28:30]  Going into a situation like that, you're prepared.  You know they're going to be asking questions.  Every time we sit down to do an interview with one of these magazines or a paper or something  or a Bill O'Reilly, we know some of the questions are going to be a little uncomfortable.  I know those Olsen twins questions are coming.  I'll answer them.  So you decide, all right, do I want to put myself through this?  Or not.  I talked about the goddamn $300 engagement ring.  I talked about the hell night that was my wedding.  Call him back. 
[01:29:00]  Call him back.  Or the publicist.  Call him back.  If I had a good chance to clear my name and go, no, that's not true, that's not true,  I would certainly do it.  I mean, I don't understand why somebody would want to do it.  We got more out of Pantera, Phil, and he was inebriated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy's a rock star.  Phil.  Get him back on the phone.  I'm so sick.  I need answers now.  I really am sick of these fake rock stars, by the way.  I'm tired of it.  I won't bring up names, but I've seen some things like backstage recently, and they're 
[01:29:30]  just fake.  They're not like, you know, I'll hand it to Norton, you know, with the dedication to Ozzy  and stuff.  When you're looking at Ozzy, you know he's not fake.  You know he's the real deal.  You know, there's a lot of bands just putting on the suit, Anthony.  That's it.  Putting on the look.  Yeah.  Oh, MTV Cribs is over.  Hey, here's where I hang with my chicks.  He had chicks dancing on the poles, like, oh, wow, look, he's Tommy Lee.  The strippers are there.  Everything. 
[01:30:00]  It's crap.  Big rock star.  Yeah, where are my dogs?  Stop it.  Whatever.  There it is.  See if he gets on the line and just bust that trash.  Ugh.  God, I'm tired of it.  See you later.  Bye.  I've got to go.  Why are we, uh...  The P word.  The P word.  The P word.  She's got a name.  Her name's Pam. 
[01:30:30]  You were married to the P word.  I think you'd want to maybe address the fact that she was accusing you of giving her the  hep.  Do you have the hep?  Yeah, that phone line just went dark.  That ain't happening.  Tell him not to talk.  No one not talking about stuff.  You know something?  And then, fine.  After we clear some other stuff out of the way.  He could talk about what he's doing.  Give and take.  No one wants to hear about Tommy Lee's music.  Being in a public eye, it's a price you pay. 
[01:31:00]  I mean, I know it's annoying to have your personal life, but you know what?  When you're making millions of dollars and your personal life is a part of that, well,  you've got to talk about it.  You know something else?  If I sat down and Tommy Lee was somewhere and I got to speak with him, I would not bring  up things like this.  Right.  It's, you know, but this is a program that people listen to based on if they're going  to hear interesting banter.  Tommy talking about his latest album and who's on it and what he's doing.  Yeah.  What could he possibly say to make people go out and buy it?  That's the give me that we give him after he gives us something. 
[01:31:30]  It's a give and take.  You know, and you get on the radio and you talk honestly and stuff, you might turn some  people around and go, hey, that Tommy Lee's an interesting guy.  Oh, he's got a new CD out?  I'm going to check it out.  What the hell?  Now he looks like a jackass.  And you look at Ozzy, and I'm not even being a nut with this, talks about, no, no, seriously,  he talks about the time he tried to strangle his wife or the things he did.  Oh, he's very open.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Real open about all the good stuff and the awful stuff.  Yeah, real rock star.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm here in my lounge.  Look at my lounge, man, where my dogs hang out. 
[01:32:00]  All my dogs.  I got a Starbucks right here in my house.  Any time any of my dogs over and I need the Starbucks, we...  Woo!  Real cool rock star.  The P word.  And he hangs up.  Where was the Starbucks the day of the party?  Might have kept a few people awake.  Yeah.  Maybe the machine was getting cleaned that day.  I don't know.  Well, that's it.  I don't care if he calls back.  It's called Never a Dull Moment, and in parentheses, unless you're on the radio. 
[01:32:30]  P equals pussy, Tommy Lee.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Your ex was on Larry King.  Yeah.  A show that the entire world was watching.  What a big dick.  Accusing you of some serious things.  And he's a jackass, too.  And this isn't a small radio show anymore.  Oh, isn't it?  No.  Oh, I wouldn't have started yelling like that if I thought it was...  Oh, I better be quiet. 
[01:33:00]  You had an opportunity to comment.  It happened last night.  Yeah.  Not even 24 hours ago.  Sorry.  You're going to be saddled with her in radio conversations and TV for a while.  It's the nature of the beast.  I'd rather, if he wants to pop on and address why he's very uptight and can't take some questions  about his ex-wife, who is Pam Anderson, you know, I mean, stop it. 
[01:33:30]  We've played the game way too long.  Yeah.  We've had publicists F with this program.  We've had people walk off, and it's just not happening anymore.  We weren't...  We didn't even get any tough questions out.  You didn't say anything.  Anything.  Stop it.  Oh.  Jesus. 
[01:34:00]  God, that bugs me because, you know, you just think Tommy Lee.  Yeah, he'd be cool about it.  Nobody would give a dick to him.  Yeah.  And I could tell right off the bat.  We're like, all right, boy, he's got total lack of any energy.  He's really not adding to the hooker.  Because we were talking about the hooker thing.  I was like, yeah, all right, Tommy.  You've been to some.  Maybe he's got a story.  Maybe something.  Yeah.  Nothing.  So I figure I'm changing directions here.  Let's go for something he does have comments on or stories on. 
[01:34:30]  We'll talk about the videotape a little.  And Pam.  You've got to go.  Shut up.  I was complimenting him.  That was entertainment.  I know.  For our Thanksgiving.  Huh?  I saw him.  His career has just gone downhill.  I saw him at Irving Plaza with his last group, Methods of Mayhem or whatever it was.  It was about 200 people in there.  Yeah.  And they were giving away tickets.  We were giving.  He couldn't give away the tickets. 
[01:35:00]  I think I went with Earl.  There was no one there.  He's no Dave Grohl as far as drummers go after bands.  That's for sure.  And his new album, you know, it's really setting the charts on fire.  Jesus, what an ass.  Oh, that bugs me.  Hate that.  Mutley crew.  Can't believe it.  Hung up.  Tommy Lee.  Tainted blood.  Hepatitis.  Doesn't want to talk about it.  P-word.  P-word.  P-word.  P-word.  P-word.  P-word.  Sounded like the biggest pussy by saying that, too. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, the P-word.  The P-word.  She's talking about you, pally.  I could see if you were saying that the P-word likes to F the N-word.  Oh, God.  Well, we'll step aside, Ant.  All right.  No surprise there.  No.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's a little something from the latest FHM magazine. 
[01:36:00]  A little interview with Pam Anderson, Anthony.  Yeah.  Are you okay with talking about the hepatitis?  Well, he put it out in the press.  He leaked it to the press to make me look like, and then she didn't finish the sentence.  He gave it to me, and he knows he gave it to me.  When we were married in Cancun, we came back and we both had physicals.  We had AIDS tests.  And he had hepatitis C.  Our doctor told him to disclose that to me, and so Tommy said he would. 
[01:36:30]  Then he told the doctor that he did tell me.  He never told me.  Then we went on vacation and shared a needle for a tattoo.  The guy said, I guess the guy had given the tattoo, I only brought one needle, but you guys are married.  Nothing could pass between you, right?  And Tommy goes, no, no problem at all.  I went to the doctor.  I had hepatitis C.  My doctor goes, well, oh, okay, then, all right, so they got the tattoo.  See, this doesn't really make sense.  Yes, it does, because the quotes end. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, okay, okay.  All right, so they share the needle, and Tommy goes, yeah, no, no problem at all here.  We could share this needle.  Pam says, I went to the doctor.  I had hepatitis C.  My doctor goes, well, you know where you got it.  And I went, no.  And the doctor says, you got it from your husband.  And I was like, what?  And the doctor said, Tommy didn't tell you that he had hepatitis C?  There you go.  Just wanted to, you know, when she's saying this in interviews, perhaps I'd like to hear his side of it. 
[01:37:30]  And then maybe get to his fantastic album and golf event.  Golf thing.  And tour and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He made his decision.  He could have done a lot of good promoting today.  Oh, no.  Let's go to Luke.  Hey, Luke, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm not trying to tell you how to run your show.  I'm not trying to break your stacks or anything.  All right.  Do you think you're being a little hard on Tommy, though?  I mean.  Why?  The guy's going, you know, he's going through something. 
[01:38:00]  His ex-wife accusing him of giving her FC.  Maybe he's just trying to be above it and just not comment on it.  Hey, Luke, you're missing the point.  Then don't do an interview.  Right.  Then stop with the interviews.  Then don't do a nationally syndicated show.  You know what?  Every interviewer out there that has the balls will ask him.  Mm-hmm.  No one cares about the album and the tour.  The biggest thing they care about is all these accusations that Pam's making in FHM magazine 
[01:38:30]  on Larry King last night.  That's what they want to know.  It's not like you guys are paparazzi and you chased him down.  No.  He came here and said, look, I want to plug this.  He called us.  He's plugging his album.  He came right to our stoop.  Of course we're going to ask.  I mean, I agree.  It's our job to ask.  I agree with you guys in a way.  Like, I know you guys are friends.  And you know what?  And the listeners expect it.  Absolutely.  Tommy Lee's on our show and we're going to, like, make believe we care about his album?  I haven't even checked it out.  I don't think many people have checked it out, to be honest with you. 
[01:39:00]  You know, but I would have given him the benefit of the doubt and listened to what he had to say about it.  But there's other things we need to get accomplished, too.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  But I kind of feel bad for him.  I think he's just trying to be, like.  And don't call a high-profile radio show.  You know what?  You guys are right.  Maybe some little rock station in Des Moines, Iowa, that doesn't have the balls to, you know, ask some questions.  Because when you're with Pam Anderson, you're going to get the recognition, like, wow, you're with Pam Anderson.  And he never said, no, I don't want to talk about that.  It's like, it's always cool to be with Pam Anderson when you're married to her. 
[01:39:30]  Well, when things go wrong, you've still got to talk about it like you did when you were married.  All right, look.  All right.  Bye.  Bye, sweetie.  What happened to our rock stars?  I don't know.  I'm so delusioned.  There's no real rock stars out there anymore.  Yeah, there's a few, but.  Not really.  They're not living the real rock star lifestyle.  I'm talking about the new.  Phil from Pantera?  I'm talking about the.  Not a lot, but in general.  That guy is living the rock style, rock star lifestyle for 20 people. 
[01:40:00]  You think Creed is living the rock star lifestyle?  No.  You mean up and coming.  That's what I'm saying.  The new guys.  The new guys.  And someone like Phil has been around for a very long time.  I'm talking about the guys that have come along in the last, let's say, five years.  You know?  Yeah.  AIDS is a big one, though.  Don't forget, man.  A lot of people just can't go out and bang like they use them.  No, I'm not even talking about AIDS and stuff.  I'm talking about how they surround themselves with people that tell them, well, you know,  it wouldn't be good to do this or say this on the radio.  Let's just focus on this.  They listened to the people around them instead of just letting it hang out like the old days. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Phil from Pantera.  He didn't have any publicists around or anything.  He said some crazy stuff.  It would have given publicists nightmares.  When the publicists are there standing around, waving their hands.  Protecting their, quote, rock star image.  Doing that finger to the throat thing like, cut, this is enough, we're done.  We're done here.  Ugh.  Go away. 
[01:41:00]  Tommy Lee.  Oh, man.  What a big downer.  You know, you remember him as being the rock star from Motley Crue.  And he's banging the models and stuff.  And he turns out to be just another ass.  Hey, Tommy, you want to jumpstart your career?  Start talking.  Talk.  Start talking.  That's what does it.  Guess what?  Your name will be in the papers again.  It's a known formula that works.  Tommy.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Tommy.  What's up, man?  Hey, why you guys call me a dick, dude?  What's up?  What's up?  Because you called up.  Like, we want to talk to you about a little bit of everything.  And you hung up.  You know what?  You hold on.  You were told not to bring up the teamwork.  What do you do?  No one told us anything.  Tommy, no one tells us what to do, first of all.  And you were the big.  No one tells us what to do.  No one told us not to bring up Pam's name.  We would never agree to that, okay?  Yes, you were.  You were the big pussy for hanging up after we asked about it instead of trying to talk 
[01:42:00]  your way out of it.  You guys did agree to it.  We did not.  My tour manager talked to your producer.  That's bullshit.  Nope.  Nope.  We would never agree to that.  Sorry.  That's kind of a big story that we wanted to hear about.  You know what, guys?  What year are you guys living in?  It's like, dude, turn the page, guys.  I've been divorced for three years.  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  It was big news last night when she was on Larry King accusing you of this. 
[01:42:30]  Don't you think it's a current story if Pam is on Larry King saying pretty much that you  gave her Hep C?  What was big news, guys?  What was big news?  Big news that she's on Larry King accusing you of giving her Hep C.  Dude, you know how many months ago she accused me of that?  It doesn't matter.  It happened last night on Larry King.  Of course we're going to bring it up.  She talked about it last night.  Hey, you know what?  She talked about it in some other stupid magazines as well.  Who cares?  Yeah, but this is the first time we're talking to you, so we'd like to maybe talk to you about 
[01:43:00]  it.  Maybe get your side of the story.  You've never really given your side of the story, right?  You know why?  What?  Because it's nobody's business.  Well, she's made it everyone's business.  Of course she is.  She's an idiot.  I would just love to hear your side of it.  If an ex is accusing me of some crazy things, you know what?  I'm going on the biggest program I can find and calling her a liar, a C, a twat.  Every name I can figure out.  Guys, I don't do that.  That's not my style, okay? 
[01:43:30]  I don't do that crap.  That's why I just hung up the phone.  I was like, you know what?  I got to go.  Because that's not my style, guys.  It may be your style, but it ain't mine.  But you look like a pussy just hanging up.  We were totally confused.  You didn't even say the first time you were on the phone, hey, guys, I thought we agreed  to this.  You know what?  I'm telling you man to man that it never got to us that we couldn't talk about Pam.  Because you know what?  We wouldn't have agreed to this interview.  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy. 
[01:44:00]  Wow, we need Tommy Lee to make a good radio show.  If you say that, I'll take my ball and not play.  I know, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  Hey, you don't want to talk about it.  I'm very open-minded.  Let me tell you something.  If we started talking about it and he just told us what he told us there, look, this  is what she's saying.  I don't like going in that direction.  To me, it's old news.  I'd rather just not really get into it. 
[01:44:30]  It would have been like, all right, that's pretty much his side of it.  If he doesn't want to dwell on it.  And us being us, we might poke at it a little more and make a goof about it.  I'm sure Jim will say some tasteless thing into the mic about it.  But you know something?  He didn't.  He just hung up and it was like, what's he doing?  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Oh, boy.  Jersey Bob here says if I type in pussy, he'll disconnect from the internet.  Wait a minute.  There you go, Jersey Bob.  You were told.  You were told. 
[01:45:00]  I'm told?  Tommy, maybe you should do your research on Ant and I.  No one tells us what to do.  I don't like being told things.  Believe me.  You call him.  You see the hesitation?  He's like, oh, my God, he called me a pussy.  Now I've got to hang up.  No one else told that.  All of a sudden, he goes, you call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  And also, I'm just looking and you know he was confused like, oh, ass.  Now I've got to hang up.  I called him out on it.  You should have told him I will not have an ultimatum put to me. 
[01:45:30]  It was that delayed.  Oh, brother.  Oh, wow.  Now I've got to hang up and I really need to promote this new CD.  Now what do I do?  Well, I guess I've got to hang up.  He's living in a bubble.  You know what I mean?  He says, what year are you living in?  That was three years ago.  No, it's still, like Ope said, when you see her on Larry King the night before talking  about it, you would think, all right, for our side alone, just for this radio, it would  be interesting to hear his rebuttal on the whole thing. 
[01:46:00]  So we're obligated to ask.  Even if his rebuttal is, I don't want to talk about it, that's not how I do things, that's  fine.  That's fine.  Then we get into other things.  He's talking like this Larry King interview happened six months ago.  Yeah, we talk about the Motley Crue days.  You were told.  There's plenty of other things you're talking about.  You were told.  Go after yourself.  Told.  E, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Ope?  Ope, I want to congratulate you on your new balls.  Why are my new ones? 
[01:46:30]  I don't know, man.  And I'm a little disappointed in you, man.  What?  And when he hung up the first time, you were digging into him, man.  Then he called back, he said the guy should have fired right at him, man.  Dude, listen to me on this.  Well, first of all, it's the Opie and Anthony show, and I went.  Yeah, you're right.  That's all that is.  If I didn't go, I guarantee my pal here Ant was going.  You know what makes good radio?  I beat him to the punch, because we were both to the point we had it.  You know what makes good radio?  Two people not yelling over each other, especially when a third is on the phone.  What we identify and know what to do, when one person's speaking, the other person has 
[01:47:00]  to back off, because you don't want to hear this.  Go ahead, Ope.  Just say anything.  Hey, Tommy, what the hell is it?  You know something?  You don't want to talk about anything.  It's August 10th.  It doesn't sound good.  August 10th.  Yeah, I mean, he's a fucking, he's a husband anyway.  Hey, hey.  No one cares about him.  Goddamn Norton, man.  All righty, thanks.  You were told not to call this program with those words.  He could have even said pending litigation. 
[01:47:30]  Perhaps that would have, you know, okay.  And use that one.  Pending litigation.  Well, for you, when I was trying to, because I had a job to do when you were going through  your mess, I was prying you to see how far I could get you to go.  And on the air, I would say, because it's true, it was, you know, pending litigation.  Perhaps there's some kind of lawsuits being filed that he can't talk about.  I don't know, unless he tells us, you know, what do we know?  We're going to talk about it.  The guy doesn't understand that after Motley Crue, the biggest thing he's known for is  a porno movie with his ex-wife, Pamela. 
[01:48:00]  That's the biggest goddamn thing.  Hey, here's some excitement.  Tommy Lee, never a dull moment.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Hey, this is Colin Quinn.  You listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and the best is Lady Diane Marion, so you can  imagine the worst.  Ricky's back with Jimmy's Bagel.  Oh.  All right, let's bring Ricky back in here, our intern, our new intern.  Oh, I got a little out of this one here.  How'd you do, Rick? 
[01:48:30]  Ricky, how'd you do?  Well, you've got to get on mic.  You went back to that other deli?  Yes.  Oh, good.  I got the change and everything.  Not toasted bagel?  Not warm.  Give Jimmy his 20 cents back, please.  All right.  Put that in your pocket, Jimmy.  Cool.  All right.  And, uh...  What's the matter?  Nothing.  It's good.  What, do you have a hot bagel?  What's wrong, Eric?  There's no cream cheese. 
[01:49:00]  My bagel is, like, burnt.  Oh, boy.  How do you know it's burnt?  You didn't even open up the package.  I don't know how hot it is.  Nothing on it.  No cream cheese.  Did you want cream cheese on your bagel?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not going to share this cream cheese.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  It's just Eric.  He's a little man on the totem pole.  You don't have to go back out.  These guys understand.  If, like, one of these guys would have gone out, they know exactly what everyone wants at  this point.  I think the training process is a little rough here, but, you know, it's something everyone's 
[01:49:30]  gone through.  Jimmy?  I just want coffee.  I'm fine, man.  Yeah, bring the coffee in.  And you got the bagels good?  Yeah, I'm not hungry right now.  He didn't get the coffee when he was getting the bagel?  No, I think he did.  Jimmy said, you know, coffee for everybody.  Where is it?  Huh?  Outside?  By the chess board?  I don't remember him mentioning coffee.  Oh, no.  We can play the tape back.  Didn't you say coffee, too, and you asked if I wanted one? 
[01:50:00]  Can we play back that part of the show or no?  No, it would be too tough?  All right, Derek's going to find it.  Yeah, we asked for coffee.  I don't want any.  Yeah.  I don't drink coffee.  Jimmy, can you do without coffee, hopefully?  Uh, no.  I've been up since yesterday.  I've been up since last night at 5 o'clock.  I slept all day yesterday, and I woke up at 5, and I'm trying to stay up today so I can  get my schedule back by going to bed tonight.  Which I have to do.  Well, the coffee's, well, that's just across the street, right? 
[01:50:30]  Starbucks, yeah.  Oh, Starbucks.  Oh, yeah, Starbucks.  Oh, okay.  Where is it?  Huh?  Starbucks is right next door.  Well, he forgot, Jimmy.  It's all right.  He's new.  Um, I want, um, you want me to jot this down?  Yeah, I have to get that down.  You're here.  Yeah, you better write it down.  Just give me a tall coffee.  I'll give you a little extra here.  Keep the 30 cents for yourself, all right?  Tall coffee with, uh, milk, not cream, please.  All right.  It's no big deal.  It's just across the street.  Um, I want a medium iced.  Huh?  No sugars?  No, I got the Splenda over here. 
[01:51:00]  That'll be nice.  Medium iced latte with, uh, skim milk, please, buddy.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  This is, this is four.  Just, like, whatever's left over from his, just use it to finish up that one.  Mm-hmm.  Well, you want the change back, though, I think.  No, no, I'm saying it's going to be more than four.  It's like 430.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, make sure you don't use any of your money.  That's not cool.  Yeah, just use the extra 30.  All right.  Medium iced latte with fat free.  Coffee?  Um, no.  No.  All right.  Ricky, sorry.  Sorry.  I know we said it, though, on the air. 
[01:51:30]  Sorry for it.  All right, there goes Ricky, the new intern.  He's, uh, heading out for, uh, I think the fifth time now.  Uh, to get food and coffee and bagels and stuff like that.  Um, he's gone.  You are awful, Jim.  Why?  Jimmy, right when, like, I noticed he was almost smiling, like, oh, boy, are they sending me  out again?  Is this a gag?  Jimmy puts on this face that completely made him wipe his smile off his face.  You put on this face like, you know, uh, no, I've been up all night. 
[01:52:00]  Like, he's getting pissed off, and the kid just, like, the smile went right away from  his face.  He says, okay, pulls out his little pad, I'll write it down.  Got to get it right.  Oh, that's funny.  All right, well, there you go.  So, uh, it's intern runaround today on the program.  We do this from time to time.  Yeah.  All the other guys are relieved that it wasn't them.  And they're all like, whew, it's the worst.  O.P. and Anthony.  Send 202 to the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:52:30]  Johnny Carson.  This is right after Johnny's death, I guess.  Yeah.  And, uh, what do we do about this?  Jay Leno.  We talked about it.  Uh, does a little tribute or something?  Monologue?  Yeah, and I believe that, uh, Ed McMahon is a guest.  Oh, that's right.  Now I remember.  It was revealed that Johnny wrote some jokes for Letterman.  Yeah.  And, uh, we talked about that.  We didn't get into your sappy, uh, blog entry on Johnny's death.  Well, it hadn't been written yet. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, right.  My poorly written and drippy blog entry had not been written yet.  I only wish I could have found the man himself.  I should be fucking beheaded.  You know something?  He is part of Americana.  I, Jesus.  As you wrote in your blog, Americana.  Believe me, I'm a douche-a-bega.  Well, basically, Johnny Carson died, and as, uh, professional broadcasters, we had something  to say about it.  Well.  He's up on the gay shit. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, Jerry.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, um, the Johnny Carson tributes continue.  Yes.  Uh, we got some audio of Leno doing a very tearful monologue.  He did.  Well, he's a poser.  I mean, you know, no one's going to take the place of, uh...  Did you see a little midget get proposed to?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Very nice. 
[01:54:00]  Here's Leno last night.  Well, hi, everybody.  Welcome to The Tonight Show.  As you all know, this has been a tough 24 hours for those of us that are fans of Johnny Carson.  Why'd you turn that off?  I had a line, damn it.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Tough 24 hours for Johnny.  And I, I, I, I go for Johnny and nothing's there.  You gotta leave those turned up.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Why is it a tough 24 hours for Jay Leno?  I know.  It's a great 24 hours for him because everyone's going to be, you know, 
[01:54:30]  even more people are going to be tuning in to the show to see what he has to say.  That's what it comes down to.  Why is it tough for him?  It's not.  Johnny Carson probably never talked to him after he left.  It's gold for him because people are going to be tuning in to see what he says.  Yeah, but they said it was tough because he had to cancel his appearance this weekend  at the Comedy Works in Albany, and they said that made it tough for Leno  because he was a big Carson fan, and he was too distraught to even perform  this Friday and Saturday in Albany at the Comedy Works.  How dare you? 
[01:55:00]  We're talking about a legend.  You're getting a cheap plug-in for your stupid comedy show.  6-8-9-0-4-90.  Don't even call.  Who cares about that?  It's about Leno.  How dare you?  Don't even call.  You are horrid.  You know, I mean, Johnny Carson was a legend,  but he didn't want to hang out with any of these people.  So how is it tough on them?  He didn't like Leno.  Everyone knows that he'd turned into a recluse after he left The Tonight Show in 92. 
[01:55:30]  Yep.  He didn't like any of you.  And he didn't like Leno.  Right.  He wanted Letterman in that position.  He was a Letterman guy.  It came out last week that he was still writing jokes for Letterman.  Yeah.  You know, because he would watch the news every day and go,  oh, I got a one-liner, and he would send jokes off to Letterman,  and Letterman used some of them.  Right.  Not a lot of them, but every once in a while,  one of those jokes that Letterman told was a Carson joke.  Came out last week.  And now Leno's going to say it's been a tough 24 hours?  Carson hated you.  He's ripping me off. 
[01:56:00]  Don't worry.  Jimmy's not going to comment because Jimmy will be on Leno again soon.  No, I don't think he hated Leno, to be very honest with you.  I think he did want Letterman to replace him because that was his guy.  Honestly, all right, hate's a little strong, but he didn't care.  He didn't care about Leno.  He didn't care about any of these people.  You're not going to.  He had a small group of friends that he kept in touch with,  and the rest of the time he spent it with his wife, and he was on a yacht.  He didn't want to be bothered by any of these jamokes.  I don't think he liked the idea of a replacement either.  He probably would have liked a whole new show to be put in there 
[01:56:30]  instead of the Tonight Show continuing,  because then it's that about Schmidt thing, you know?  It's the new young kid coming in,  dumping all your stuff out in the dumpster in the back.  Dumping all your old jokes into the dumpster.  And I'm sure he would watch Letterman  and wouldn't sit there and watch Leno on the Tonight Show  because you don't want to sit there and watch your own show, you know?  Well, the Late Show, you ever see the film about Leno and Letterman  where they kind of indicate that he was squeezed out  because of Helen Kushnick, who was Jay's manager at the time,  who was relentless and awful, allegedly. 
[01:57:00]  Right, right.  I mean, everyone who made her head of the guts.  Oh, that was huge news back then, what a prick bitch she was.  And Jay wanted to come on his first day  and do a tribute to Carson his first day,  because he understands,  and then she forbade it, you know,  and she was just an awful woman.  Yeah, well, I mean, all these celebrities are coming out of the woodwork  and they're, I don't know,  are they a little bummed that Carson passed?  Sure, but they're more excited  that they're getting FaceTime all over the country today, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Ed McMahon?  When was the last time you saw Ed?  Ed McMahon is enjoying that he's back in the spotlight.  When was the last time you saw Ed? 
[01:57:30]  And he's on every, every newscast.  Jay Leno invited him on last night.  Mm-hmm.  Did he come on?  Yeah, he was on.  I think we have a little audio of that, too.  But here's Jay Leno.  You know, it was a tough 24 hours for Jay.  Very tough, man.  It wasn't tough for any of these guys.  I mean, sentimental, sure.  Bringing back some memories,  but it wasn't like they actually lost a friend.  Yeah, he wasn't bedside with Johnny.  Well, hi, everybody.  Welcome to The Tonight Show.  As you all know,  this has been a tough 24 hours  for those of us that are fans of Johnny Carson. 
[01:58:00]  You know, I was thinking about what I could say about Johnny Carson,  and I kept trying to search for something new  that hadn't been said before.  And after a couple hours,  I realized that was impossible.  Maybe that was the greatest thing about Johnny.  Imagine getting to the end of your life  and there's no compliment.  You haven't been paid.  Johnny had that special quality of grace, charm,  and dignity in the public arena.  He was an incredibly polite man, 
[01:58:30]  and when you were invited into his house,  this show,  you knew you were an honored guest.  Before he came host of The Tonight Show,  he was host of a show called Who Do You Trust,  which was a perfect title for a show starring Johnny Carson,  because the truth is,  we trusted Johnny.  We trusted him to make us laugh,  to entertain us,  to speak for us  with what was truly an American voice.  Johnny hosted this show for 30 years.  Think about that.  These days,  some NBC shows don't last 30 days.  My God.  What made Johnny such a unique talent was, 
[01:59:00]  for 30 years,  he was hip,  but he was smart enough  not to be so hip  that next year,  he was out of stock.  Jay's really nervous,  and Jay is sounding like  he's narrating a movie.  I was just about to say,  yeah,  you know what sucks about this?  He's reading this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, his writers,  I'm sure he didn't just write this.  If it was such a tough 24 hours,  I guarantee,  and this is where Jim and I disagree,  I love Letterman.  I think he's great.  I think Letterman could have,  I don't know what Letterman did.  I think Letterman's in reruns.  I like his statement, 
[01:59:30]  by the way.  Letterman's statement I liked.  Yeah,  but Letterman would just,  Was it F him?  Letterman would just go out there,  and this is the difference between the two,  and just talk from his heart.  Leno,  Leno's reading something,  a prepared statement.  Leno's writers got together,  wrote a statement for him,  and he's reading.  If you're so talented,  and you took over Carson,  you should be able to just walk out there  and speak from your heart  for a couple minutes.  Not read a statement.  No compliment can be paid  that wasn't paid,  and Johnny grew up in a small town 
[02:00:00]  in Nebraska,  so he's doing a Johnny-mentry.  Yeah,  well,  you're right,  it's like a narration.  Yeah.  You know,  there's no real heartfelt,  eh,  man,  man.  Letterman actually said,  I liked what Letterman said,  I think it was like,  it was a prepared statement,  but he's like,  anyone,  any one of us who came after him  were pretenders,  which I thought was a great thing to say.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  and I remember the rest of the statement,  but I liked what he said,  although I'm not a fan of his show at all.  He's hip,  but he was smart enough  not to be so hip  that next year he was out of style.  That was a fine,  almost impossible line to walk, 
[02:00:30]  and no one did it better  than Johnny Carson.  Johnny never went out of style.  As a comedian,  he taught me it was okay  to be known for doing political humor,  but never make the mistake  of thinking you're a political commentator.  It's okay to satirize  the society we live in,  just don't start believing  that you're a social commentator.  You know,  people say this country is divided now,  but these people forget  the 60s and the early 70s.  There were daily marches,  there were race riots,  there were assassinations,  there were anti-war demonstrations.  Oh, the good old days.  We witnessed the most drastic 
[02:01:00]  cultural change in American history,  but throughout it all,  no matter what the state of the world,  it seemed to get its sanity back  every night at 1130.  Johnny was a constant in our lives,  and every night he made us feel okay about it.  And as good as Johnny was  with the celebrities and the politicians,  he was at his best  with just ordinary folks.  Because they didn't treat him  as Johnny Carson,  the king of late night.  They treated him as Johnny Carson  from Nebraska.  You know,  there was always a moment  he would ask him,  you know,  you say to someone,  do you ever watch my show? 
[02:01:30]  And the person would say something like,  no, I don't.  I don't stay up late  unless there's something worthwhile to do.  Well,  Johnny loved that.  He would laugh and laugh  and thought that was  the greatest thing in the world.  And as a performer,  I don't think I ever wanted  to impress anyone  more than Johnny Carson.  He had that effect  on all comedians.  When he gave you the wave  or that wink  or little call over to the desk,  nothing before or since  has had such a profound effect  on me  as that one little gesture  is,  hey,  come on over here. 
[02:02:00]  You know,  in the mid-80s,  I started working  as a guest host for Johnny  and it's strange.  And after all these years,  I still feel like  Is this in real time, Jay?  Because he really built this place.  Everyone who does this for a living  owes it to him.  December 90.  Johnny was the best,  plain and simple.  And the best way  to sum it up is,  I guess,  you know,  you had to be there.  If you were fortunate enough  to be watching  during Johnny's 30-year run,  consider yourself lucky  because you're not going to see  the likes of him  ever again.  Here's some favorite moments. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  Here's some favorite moments.  I love what you said  about being a political commentator  and you're not,  like that with those two lessons  that comedians fall into.  He was absolutely right.  Good point.  True.  Some people get a little too serious  when it comes to that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, you look at The Daily Show  and Jon Stewart's a great comic  and they're talking about him  replacing Dan Rather.  I know.  Dude, you're not a real,  I'm not saying he wants that,  but you're not a real news guy.  You're a comedian.  Is he going to be able  to pull his collar and go,  No.  On the news?  I don't think so.  Like, that's why I watch  The Daily Show. 
[02:03:00]  It's because it's funny.  You know?  You know, I don't think  that's going to wash  on the CBS News.  Yeah, they're doing a story  about the tsunami.  Yeah.  It's going to break into  a Woody Allen voice.  So I don't think it's going to help.  They do that.  And it tends to happen  more with the left.  I'm sorry,  but liberal comics tend to fall  into this intrigue  with Garoppolo and a lot of them.  Like, they think that  they're all of a sudden  these brilliant political voices.  It's like,  you can skewer politics  and trash it,  but you're not this  enlightened genius.  Your job is to make people laugh. 
[02:03:30]  If you're not doing it  making people laugh,  you're cheating  and you're a fraud.  You know who's really good  at it?  Louis Black.  Um, who?  Yeah, Louis, uh...  Wait, no, no.  I've heard that name.  Don't tip me off.  Look, I'm pissed off  at him, too.  But the fact is,  I do find him funny.  Yes.  And, uh, you know,  I can't be phony.  You know, I find the guy funny.  I also find him to be a prick  because he hasn't even attempted  to be on this program.  He's actually shunning it.  You know who's brilliant at it?  It's Colin. 
[02:04:00]  There's nobody better than Colin  at being political and funny  and biting and...  Absolutely.  ...just vicious.  Yep.  And always being funny.  Yeah.  Always being funny.  So now we got Leno  and, uh, they dragged, uh,  Ed McMahon out.  Whoa, ho, ho.  Johnny's sidekick  for so many years.  Who doesn't remember  plump Ed McMahon  chuckling along?  Another guy that, uh,  Johnny Carson  didn't feel like  hanging out with.  Nah.  At all.  Nah.  The guy that he did  the radio, uh, the TV show  with, uh, for 30 years.  Nothing.  They went to lunch 
[02:04:30]  every once in a while.  Oh, oh, oh.  Every once in a while.  Right now, I want to welcome, uh,  the man who shared  the Tonight Show stage  with Johnny for 30 years,  Mr. Ed McMahon,  ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  Hello.  A lot of hugs right here.  The Tonight Show. 
[02:05:00]  Starring with special guest  Tony Randall.  Oh, thank you.  Uh, uh, standing ovation.  I appreciate that,  and, uh, I know Johnny  somewhere is appreciating that.  Well, it's great.  No, he's not.  He's rotting.  He's dead.  Johnny's annoyed,  going, what are you giving  this stupid second banana  a round of applause for?  He did nothing but nod and laugh.  Standing ovation.  Jesus.  How great was their  chemistry, though, man,  between him and McMahon?  Like, Johnny would be doing  Karnak, and Ed would just  repeat what he had just said,  and just the look he would  give him, like, you fat asshole. 
[02:05:30]  He would shut up.  He was just a buffoon  sitting there.  Go back to your announcers,  Mike, and leave me alone.  And Rickles would just come on  and skewer everybody.  Yeah.  That's the greatest.  Honey, somewhere is  appreciating that.  Well, it's great to see you.  You know, it really is great  to see you because I feel  the...  It's so great to see you  that, uh, I'm sorry  I haven't had you on  in the last day ever.  I've been here ten years  and haven't had you on.  I love this Hollywood  phoniness.  I was, uh...  It was really good to see you.  It was an oversight.  Sorry Johnny had to die 
[02:06:00]  for me to invite you  on to the show,  but it's great to see you.  Bit of an oversight.  Ten years?  Yeah, it's so great  to see you.  Sure.  Jesus.  Great to see you  because I feel this is like...  I don't know.  It's just...  It's very emotional  to see you now  and I'm glad you could  take the time  to come and hear this.  I'm very happy to be here.  Thank you.  And, uh,  I had quite a day yesterday.  You can imagine,  uh, Jeff Sotsick  called me at 7 a.m.  And, uh,  I had one of those days  crying, laughing  all day long.  And I just saw,  by the way,  your essay. 
[02:06:30]  Was that marvelous  that essay he did?  Well, well...  He called it an essay?  An essay.  Essay.  Yeah.  An essay.  It was awful.  Wasn't that great  that Watto he did?  It was absolutely awful.  It was horrible.  That essay he did...  Well...  It's all true.  That's so good, of course.  But the clips,  you know,  and I was there,  but I see him again,  I laugh all over again.  And I've got hope for you.  You know,  Johnny would always  add some lightness, 
[02:07:00]  so I have a little lightness  for you.  My son, Jeff,  you just met him.  He's with me.  Driving over,  he told me,  he's got a little  five-year-old,  my granddaughter,  Sarah McMahon,  right?  Sarah Michael McMahon.  So she's watching  some of these clips  and she said,  she turns and says,  Granddaddy lost  his best friend.  And, uh...  That's right.  She says,  well,  who in the world  is going to replace him?  Oh, man.  And that's something,  because she thinks  the show is still on.  That's the story?  And he's gone.  Shut up. 
[02:07:30]  So there's a chance  you could come in.  No wonder you haven't  been invited on the show  in the last ten years.  That's all you've got?  You worked with a guy  for 30 years  and that's all you've got?  And Daddy lost  his best friend.  Oh, shut up.  Who's going to replace him?  So I was hoping  for some kind of punchline.  Yeah.  So I hit her  and said,  shut up, stupid.  Or I sang a tsunami  parody at her.  What was that?  That's the type of question  Voss would ask.  You lost your best friend. 
[02:08:00]  Who's going to replace him?  Who's going to replace him?  Here's McMahon  discussing with Jay  Johnny's privacy.  Johnny was a very complex guy.  I mean,  I don't pretend to know him.  I'd been to dinner  and I'd been to his house,  but it was,  I mean,  explain a little about it,  because he seemed  incredibly nutty shy.  Yeah, he was.  Oh, totally shy.  You know,  he was great  with 10 million people,  lousy with 10.  You know,  the worst thing  in the world,  and I did something  to him.  We had a show  called 
[02:08:30]  Bloopers and Practical Jokes.  What?  Because he was great  with 10 million people,  lousy with 10.  Well,  like your parties.  But I try.  Yeah,  you have no chips.  Right.  And I got rid of the mouse,  so I think people  will start hanging out again.  Me and Ed  in a jubalogue.  Okay.  Ed,  call the fire department.  All right,  it's not that funny.  Relax. 
[02:09:00]  Don't relax.  There's a mouse  in my house,  and he was,  I was chasing him  with a piece of cheese  trying to get him out.  And,  yes,  Ed was over.  We lit a jubalogue,  and it started smoking  in the whole house.  Smoking.  It looked like  Doc in a band meeting.  You know,  because they smoke pot  and I always joke about it.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  Well,  the fire department  showed up.  It was like  the mighty Carson  art players  walking in.  Oh.  There I was  in Ed's arms,  nude.  Oh.  And the doctors  later told me  that gave me  emphysema.  A jubalogue  in flames.  Emphysema.  Great with 10 million,  horrible with 10. 
[02:10:00]  What's wrong  with two men  nude a jubalogue  and some wine?  There was no nudity.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, well,  get back to the clip.  Johnny was a very complex guy.  I mean,  I don't pretend to know him.  I'd been to dinner  and had been to his house,  but it was,  I mean,  explain a little bit  because he seemed  incredibly shy.  Yeah, he was.  Oh, totally shy.  You know,  he was great  with 10 million people,  lousy with 10. 
[02:10:30]  You know,  the worst thing  in the world,  and I did something  to him.  We had a show  called Bloopers  and Practical Jokes.  And he produced it.  His company produced it.  So he caught me  leaving the gate here  with stuff loaded  in the backseat  of my car,  my limousine,  and I thought  I was going to be arrested.  You know,  with all this stuff  in the back,  I thought my driver  had done something wrong.  He caught me,  nailed me.  All right?  So I feel  I'm going to get back at him.  He went to Wimbledon  and we set up  a thing in Wimbledon.  We made him go  to a cocktail party. 
[02:11:00]  Brandon Tartikoff  says you've got  to go to this party.  Got him to the party  and all these actors,  beautiful British actors  were doing this gibberish.  They were talking gibberish  and he was there  and he hated  every minute of it.  And the guy would say,  what was the cost?  You're from  all for the continent.  Oh, I was wondering,  have you ever been  to London before?  Because I know  and then I knew  and they're doing  all this gibberish  and Johnny is there  and you can see  the sweat starting  from the eyebrows  going down 
[02:11:30]  and he's going  and he's looking  for some place  to hide, right?  He almost killed me.  Oh, he was so mad  when he got nailed.  And Ed wonders  why Johnny never  wanted to hang out  with him.  Doesn't want to bite him over.  What a hack.  Yeah, thank you.  Practical jokes on Johnny,  the guy that just wants  privacy, doesn't want  anyone screwing with him,  goes to a restaurant  and Ed's playing jokes  on him.  Ugh. 
[02:12:00]  Fat nothing.  Ugh.  What a prick.  Just trying to eat.  Has fake English people  coming over to him.  Yeah, no wonder  he never invited him over.  All right.  A couple of urban legends,  Anthony?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, I was reading  some of the message boards  and some people actually  post this stuff as true.  And I bet people  that are listening now  will actually go,  no, I remember seeing that.  There's two urban legends  concerning the Tonight Show  with Johnny Carson.  One of them 
[02:12:30]  is that  Zsa Zsa Gabor  was on the show  as a guest  and  she had a cat with her  and the cat  was on her lap  and  she said,  would you like to pet  my pussy?  I thought that was  Raquel Welch.  See?  The story gets all confused  because it's an urban legend.  And she said,  would you like to pet my pussy?  And Johnny said,  yeah,  as soon as you move  that damn cat.  That never happened?  No,  never,  never happened.  First of all, 
[02:13:00]  back then,  it wouldn't have made it  through the censors.  They would go nuts  for something like that.  Well,  did it not happen?  Did it happen  and then all of a sudden  just get cut out of the show?  Nope,  never,  ever happened.  And there's actually  a clip of  Jane Fonda  on an appearance  on the show  and she brought it up  to Johnny  and Johnny dispels  the whole thing.  If we could play it.  Well,  you know,  I've been bitching  about this CD player  for,  you know,  weeks.  Hold up.  Oh,  look what's here.  All right,  here's the clip, 
[02:13:30]  Anthony.  That's good news.  Here's the clip.  All right.  I've got to ask you something.  Last night,  my son,  you know,  you were talking about  Jaja Gabor earlier.  My son said,  you know,  she was on  Johnny Carson's show  one time.  She came there  with a cat on her lap  and she said to you,  do you want to pet my pussy?  My son said  that you said,  I'd love to  if you'd remove  that damn cat. 
[02:14:00]  I tell you,  I...  Is it true?  No,  I think I would  recall that.  Wow,  that's a huge laugh.  That's great.  Can you believe  that got through?  How great is  The Tonight Show?  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Tonight Show  is always great to tune into 
[02:14:30]  because you would see  stuff like that  and that kind of stuff  was never happening  on regular TV  like during the day,  during prime time.  They would allot them  a lot more latitude  for doing material  that was a little more  risque.  Some of those  Mighty Carson  R-Player bits  that he used to do  had some double entendre  and stuff thrown in  and the girl  with the big blonde  with the huge cans  and Johnny's constantly  looking right down her shirt  and making tit jokes.  You know,  what amounted to tit jokes  on television.  But what if kids see that  though?  That's my concern. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, mine too.  You worry about children  seeing that.  Mine too.  So that never happened?  Never happened.  Urban legend.  The other one  is that  Arnold Palmer's wife  was on the show  which is suspect  right there.  It's like,  why is Arnold Palmer's wife  on the show?  And  Johnny asked  if they have any  good luck rituals  and  she said that  yeah,  I kiss Arnold's balls  before he plays  meaning his golf ball  and 
[02:15:30]  Johnny said  that must put a flutter  in his putter  and  that never happened.  Never happened.  I hope not.  That's awful.  I know.  Isn't that just horrible?  And when I  read it on a message board  I'm like  that  that is so not true.  Some of these things  if you hear them  or read them  and you just know  they're fake  you wonder how  anybody thinks  these things are real.  And some guy  posted it  on a message board  as  one of my favorite  memories 
[02:16:00]  from the Tonight Show  was when  Arnold Palmer's wife  was on  and then tells  the whole story.  And he actually  has it as a memory  in his head.  And he's one of those people  you cannot convince  that never happened  because they actually  believe it.  He's said it  so many times  that he actually  thinks he heard it.  Yep.  Do we have audio?  What are you doing?  No, unfortunately  we don't have audio  of that one.  It never happened.  No, I mean  of him dispelling it.  Actually, it was  dispelled on  The Tonight Show 
[02:16:30]  with Jay Leno.  Jay had Arnold Palmer  on.  Oh, okay.  And he asked  Arnold Palmer  about it  and Arnold Palmer  said no,  it never happened  and he goes  please don't ask me  any more about it  because I guess  having for years  to hear about  his wife  kissing his balls  must upset Arnie.  He said to Jay  or to the audience?  To America?  He said to Jay  like alright  don't ask me  about it anymore.  What a baby.  Well, he's probably  one of those  older conservative guys  who's, you know  his wife kissing  his balls  to everybody  that being the 
[02:17:00]  running joke  about your wife  Hey Arnie  your wife gonna  kiss your balls  today?  You hear it so many  times  you're probably like  eh  enough.  You wanna try  one more clip  Johnny Carson?  Where's your noise?  Yeah, cause they  plugged some stuff in  They hooked some  stuff up  Uh, hold on  there  Go ahead  It's over, Johnny  There you go  They found our  instant replay  It's over, Johnny  They just came  off a truck  They were sent  to Washington  ended in Tennessee  and then back 
[02:17:30]  to Washington  now back in New York  I have no templates  though  So you have no  idea what  you're playing?  No, watch  Get on your hands  and knees  like a dog  That's it  Call around  like a dog  It's just a  like  It's a mystery  It's a sound effect  grab bag  What, you two?  Yeah, let me try one  Give it a whirl  Nothing  You get nothing  Let me try again  Oh, good one  Thank you, Anthony  How about this one? 
[02:18:00]  You're just a tool  Oh, alright  Yeah, well, how about  You got a lot of laughs  I don't care  I don't care  I honestly don't care  Don't care  Alright  Well, why don't we  go to break, Anthony?  You can keep your hands  off of my meal  So we can get the  instant replays  all set up  Right, right, right, right  We got the midget  audio finally  of the little midget  girl getting married  We also have this  great website  called Rent-A-Midget  that is very funny  I don't know  if it's real  though  We should try  to get the guy 
[02:18:30]  that is running  this website  on the air  to talk about it  This guy from  Wackbag  saying, Anthony  in that clip  Carson was being  sarcastic when he  said, I think I  would remember  that tool  No, he's not  He's saying that  it never happened  Find the clip  What an idiot  They got just about  every Tonight Show  on tape, right?  That is not  It's not real  If it was real  someone would have  that clip, don't you think?  Of course they would  Well, you know  Johnny Carson 
[02:19:00]  passed away  You're kidding!  Everyone's doing  their tribute  How did it happen?  So people felt like  People felt like  they had to  write the editor  of this newspaper  I think it might be  the Daily News  I'm not even sure  Yeah, this one's  the Daily News  Okay  And it's titled  It's Harry B. Jones  Anthony  Had to write a letter  to the editor  And the headline is  Laughter in Heaven  Ah, laughter in Heaven  Laughter in Heaven, everyone  Get your tissues out 
[02:19:30]  New Hyde Park, Long Island  As a child of the 60s  I remember watching  the Ed Sullivan show  as a family  But when I was able  to stay up  to watch Johnny Carson  I knew I was being  treated as an adult  St. Peter is saying  Here's Johnny  They felt like  they had to print that  in the editorial section today  Here's Johnny  Maybe St. Peter  is saying that  but the rest of the country  reading your letter  is saying 
[02:20:00]  You melodramatic  jizzbag  So basically  I guess what this guy  is saying  St. Peter  is telling all  the tsunami victims  Yeah  To wait in line  and they're bringing  Johnny to the front  of the line  There's a velvet rope  up there too  You know  it takes a while  to process  a quarter million people  There's a quarter million  people online  waiting to get  into heaven  but no  Hold on everybody  Here comes Johnny  Who do I gotta blow  to get to the front  of the line  You hear the music 
[02:20:30]  in a bunch of little  children of Indonesian descent  going  Where's mommy?  Yeah  Because God  I hate that  when they go  I just want one  of these  I can't have two  I'm trying to  watch my figure  If I don't  who will  I have a donut  you put two together  to donuts  You know  All right  Under laughter  in heaven  there's another  letter to the editor  This is even worse  than the first one  No way  You ready for this one 
[02:21:00]  from Little Neck  Frederick writes  Oh boy  Johnny Carson  truly an icon  in American entertainment  was a national institution  for 30 years  He gave us a smooth  nightcap of banter  and heartland charm  I guess maybe  God needs a few  of Johnny's jokes  to cheer him up  as he looks  at mankind today  Wait  What?  Can't God get NBC  and watch  or order the old CDs 
[02:21:30]  He can order  the old DVDs  I'm sure  God has a DVD player  He's God  for God's sake  Wait a minute  God needs a laugh  Well yeah  they're trying to explain  why Johnny  had to go  Anthony  Yeah  He finishes his little letter  I guess maybe  God needs a few  of Johnny's jokes  to cheer him up  as he looks  at mankind today  Because today  it's so bad  that God would need  something to make him laugh  He didn't take Johnny  years during the Vietnam War  But God is causing  all the havoc  Yeah  Like the tsunami 
[02:22:00]  was a quote  an act of God  a lot of people are saying  Yeah wait a minute  So he could like  If God caused the tsunami  why would he  So God is so cruel  that he could kill  a quarter million people  and then kick back  put his feet up  and laugh at Johnny  that he just killed  Right  Plus according to 97  God's laughing  as the bodies  wash away anyway  Right  Did I say God's laughing?  Yeah whatever  I said it right  That's what I meant to say  After killing a quarter million  You said God 97  Yeah listen to 97  According to 97 
[02:22:30]  God is laughing  while the bodies  are washed away  I thought you meant  hot 97  but I think you said  God 97  You did say God 97  Oh no  If you said God  we're going to have  to listen to the tape  No you said God 97  God did your brain  short circuit  You point out  every time I make a mistake  you said God 97  Oh yeah you did  I didn't  Am I right or wrong  Hawk I didn't  You said God 97  Hawk knows  No  That's how hot comes out  when you got a big huge  whatever you're eating  in your face  four hours from now  you will either  be right or wrong 
[02:23:00]  apology from me  or I will laugh my ass off  Yeah four hours from now  I'll just ring you up  Okay you're right  I'm sorry  You think Johnny  is still talking  into a microphone  to make God laugh  is talking in a  patch severed toe  Is it up there  It's gotta be  It led a good life  I guess maybe God  needs a few of  Johnny's jokes  to cheer him up  as he looks at  mankind today  So he kills  a quarter million people  and then he wants  to sit back  and enjoy a few  one-liners  Yeah why don't  have Johnny  just send him  the jokes in  like he's  a letterman  Man that's awful  Tsunami  Tsunami 
[02:23:30]  That is just  awful awful stuff  What do you do  to Nami  when he hits  you with his car  That's really good  I didn't know  I was working  with such a talented  talented guy  Wow  That's pretty damn  funny man  Johnny from Monaki 
[02:24:00]  Johnny from Monaki  My toe came off  May my toe  fall in your  milkshake  Hey this is  Brian Regan  and you are  listening to the  worst of  Opie and Anthony  on XM  Hey Ricky's back  with the coffee  That was fast  Oh my god  Coffee  Cool  Thanks man  Is it cold out  there bud?

[02:24:30]  Let me see  Where did you  get the  seltzer?  Oh this is  perfect  Downstairs  That's not that  far right  I should have  told you  if you were  going for coffee  Could you grab  a can of  seltzer please?  Sure  Thanks man  Hey Ricky  You're doing  such a good job  Here's  21 cents  You tell  Ty Webb  I'm gunning  for him  There you go  Nice  Perfect coffee  Here you go  Yeah  I just need 
[02:25:00]  seltzer  Little club soda  or seltzer?  Wow  Get club soda  I don't know if they have  club soda  I prefer the club soda  to tell you the truth  as opposed to seltzer  Seltzer stinks  But yeah  See if you can find  some club soda  Seltzer's like  Ricky thanks  Yeah that audio  is really  it's like  Don't forget  it's club soda  right? 
[02:25:30]  It's like  from the old days  it's just so  completely  just so completely  dated  a few seconds  as they're walking  It's just really  old stuff  Yeah  What is old?  What?  Just the audio  you can see  what old  Oh my god  Well I'm making  Ricky's outside  he's a little confused  because he heard  club soda  and seltzer  Yeah  No club soda  is the way to go  Yeah club soda  Whatever one he brings  you gotta say 
[02:26:00]  you wanted the other one  Of course I do  Ah  Still there?  Yeah I think so  because Eric is a dummy  Was it on out there though?  Oh it's on  Oh okay  So whatever he brings back  is going to be the wrong thing  It's going to be the wrong thing  Okay  It's the worst  of Opie and Anthony  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program 
[02:26:30]  That's Fozzy enemy bro  Yeah  Chris Jericho in studio  We talked to Chris Jericho  on the phone about that song  I love it  I wasn't expecting much  I think I told you on the phone  because you were doing like  kind of a cover band type of thing  Right absolutely  Yeah  So my buddy 
[02:27:00]  Eddie from Big Brother  the one legged dude  Yeah that's right  He acts  I forgot about that  He's the actor  in the enemy video  and he was the one  who sent it to me  I'm like  alright well  Eddie's a friend of mine  and you know  we've had Chris  on the show a bunch  and my expectations were low  I'm not going to lie to you  That's not a cut down  And then I saw the video  and heard the song  and I was instantly a fan  and blown away by both  Blown away  That's very good  People are pleasantly surprised  when they hear it  all across the board  which is good  I mean that's  that's kind of cool 
[02:27:30]  because people  like they said  they think  well this can't be any good  because it's a wrestler singing  but I mean what difference  does it make  if it's a wrestler  or a florist  or a psychiatrist  it's either good music  or it's bad  and people are digging it  so that's cool for us  I think because wrestlers  don't have that record  behind them  of good records  Yeah exactly  You look at maybe  the Hulkster  I remember the Hulkster  playing a couple  Oh yeah  So in the line  of wrestlers  becoming musicians  you're pretty much  an original  Anthony I got  Stop  you got the Hulk Hogan disc  Oh you got the Hulk  record there  I got to hear some of that 
[02:28:00]  I got the Hulk Hogan record  Is that where he sings  gospel music?  This is the one  it's called  Hulk Hogan  and the Wrestling Boot Band  Hulk rules  Wow  See there you go  that's my competition  right there  Yeah there it is  Yeah that's the automatic  you think of  Now give us a track  off there  Gotta hear it  Well which one  did you like?  There's so many  to choose from  I like the rock  and American one  It's very patriotic  We found the other two  that you liked  I want to be a Hulkamaniac  and Hulkster in Heaven  Remember that one?  Yeah yeah  That's the gospel one 
[02:28:30]  That's the touching one  Yeah that's right  Let's hear the rock  and one first  and then we'll hear the ballad  Well Eric  Eric is like a Hulkster geek  which one is the rockin' one?  I don't think any of them  are all rockin'  I think that's kind of  an oxymoron  Yeah this isn't like  There might be an up-tempo song  but rockin' would  Isn't there the one you mentioned?  The Hulkster in Heaven  or I want to be a Hulkamaniac?  I want to be a Hulkamaniac  I want to be a Hulkamaniac  That's got to be the one  We are not comparing this 
[02:29:00]  to what Chris Jericho  is doing musically  by the way  Please don't  Come on  Oh my gosh  This kicked ass  Rick Astley  Watch out  Oh that's great  I want to be a Hulkamaniac  Have fun with my family and friends  Have fun with my family and friends  Yeah  Alright  Oh my gosh  He's rapping  Who the fuck enjoys this? 
[02:29:30]  Nobody  How famous are you  when people around you say  Oh this is good  Yeah exactly  This is a great idea  People actually greenlit that  and said this is good  This is going to make us money  But then again  people greenlit  William Hung as well  It's the same shit right?  We have one that beats all of them  The Joe Pesci record  Wow 
[02:30:00]  Right  He's not really singing is he?  Oh my gosh  Rapping  More rapping  Why?  People decided that  they had to rap  because that's what  the kids are listening to  That's what the kids want  The kids want the rap star  But of all the stars  It's like Joe Pesci  He's our man  Why Joe?  Of all the guys you can choose  Why did Joe decide to do that?  What kind of street cred  does Joe have?  No we can do that  None  We can play bitches that'll get you  On just the bed  Bitches gonna get you?  It's the bitches that'll get you  That's Joe Pesci  That's Joe Pesci  I don't believe  Do we have it?  They should have a sample of him  saying they fuck you 
[02:30:30]  in the drive-thru  They fuck fuck fuck  fuck you in the drive-thru  Wait wait wait wait  I wanna be a hok  Jericho does a show on  Fun with my family and friends  We got a little harmony there too  That was wonderful  Here's the follow-up by the way  Talk about bringing the show  to a screeching halt  Here's the follow-up  Oh this is a nice one  Wasn't the kid a hulk  This kid was a big hulk band  He died  You heard this before?  Oh my god yeah  Hulkster in heaven  Oh my gosh  Saw him on TV 
[02:31:00]  I guess he'll be one empty seat  When I wrestle at Wembley  Wembley  Wait a minute  Hold on  That could be the worst rhyme  I've ever heard  I've thrown a flag  He made Wembley  into a four-world  Four-syllable word  Wembley  Wembley  And it's a lie  because his father  would probably just  scalp the ticket outside  Somebody will sit there  Wembley  Wembley  I went back  I guess he'll be one empty seat 
[02:31:30]  When I wrestle at Wembley  That is awful  I've never heard of this  in existence before  This is the first time  I've ever heard this record  Fantastic  And I guarantee it's the last  The last  I used to tear my shirt  But now you turn my heart  I knew you were a hulkamaniac  Right from the very start  Right from the start  The gospel singers  in the background  Bring in the girls  Yeah 
[02:32:00]  Wow  I would like to see a sound scan  on how many records that sold  Yeah  How many returns there was as well  You were my friend  I see your fucking hands  Just trying to get to the heart  Hope still comes to heaven  Heaven, heaven, heaven  We'll tag up again  We'll tag up again  We'll do it again  The world just won't 
[02:32:30]  All right  Enough of that  Wow  We'll tag up again  Celebrity skeet shooting  and use that as the first target  for sure  He's going to wrestle once again  with a five-year-old  with Hodgkins  That's really attractive  We'll wrestle again  Again  Oh, is that horrid?  I'm in shock at this point in time  I think we all are  Ladies and gentlemen  This is what you paid  your hard-earned money for  to get XM Radio  to hear us play Hulkster songs  Play Hulkster songs  This is it 
[02:33:00]  Someone's enjoying it  That's right  It's Hulkster Monday, brother  Let's go to Tim in Tennessee  Tim  Macho Man Randy Savage  put out some of the best  wrestling rap ever recorded  Macho Man has some?  You've never heard that?  Do we have that?  Are you kidding me?  Of course I wouldn't have  You are a man amongst men there, Chris  I've got to tell you  because  the track record  of wrestlers making music  is all alone  Now you're going to have to  play our song 
[02:33:30]  because now it's just  getting lumped into  this horrible  I'm going to defend  Chris Jericho  I didn't say anything bad about him  No, he didn't  No, he hasn't  I'm just saying  if you're listening at home  and you heard what we just heard  it's just spiraling out of control  He's not putting out his music  as Chris Jericho  What?  He's part of Fozzy  Well, there you go  He's separating the two, Anthony  That's the key  That's the secret  That is the secret  I don't want to give it away  but that is the secret  That's the secret to it all  This is not positive  No call getting Hollywood 
[02:34:00]  off your  whatever they call you  I'm coming after you  You really caught  You're kidding me  I think it is  I'm glad you set it off  Set it off  Who's to be hard off  now you done turns off  Doing telephone commercials  I seen ya  Dancing in tight  as a ballerina  I do want to know  you and those tendencies  Cause you've been running  from lockdown  like I got a disease  Dude  This is Walker  I'm digging this  Come on  That bony fight  The rocks  It's made too fast  But when I tell his  homie threw a real fight 
[02:34:30]  He passed  I called him out  But the punk was  scared to go  It was a charity event  But the Hulk didn't show  Hollywood Hulk stuff  You're at the end of your rope  And I'm going to kick you  in the butt  Wash your mouth  I was so  Cause  Like Rodney Dangerfield  You get so respect  So come on  Hulk McRack  So I can put you in chat  Be a man Hulk  Come on  That is terrible  That is really bad  Be a man Hulk  Be a man Hulk  Here's a secret  You got no clairs  If you're going to do  Like if you're a wrestling guy 
[02:35:00]  And you want to make a record  Don't sing about wrestling  Yeah I know  He's rapping about wrestling  It's terrible  That is fucking terrible  I'm going to be the first  You fuck with me  You'll stick a Slim Jim up your ass  Oh yeah  I never heard that either  I'm out of the loop  Of the wrestling albums guys  Thank god  It didn't influence you  Yeah no kidding  You know if you heard this beforehand  You might have gone that  A whole rap direction  Another direction  Alright we got  Swiggy checking in  Swiggy  Hey guys 
[02:35:30]  What's going on  Hangin out with Chris Jericho  Hey Chris  I got to ask you something  I know you can't give a true answer to this  But I want to turn the topic  Of conversation back to wrestling  What the hell is the deal  With Triple H  I mean come on  You got a new champion  And Batista  And Triple H is all over  Saying how wonderful he is  Booking 101  That's not how you promote  A new champion  I mean it's ridiculous  Well  I know you're unhappy there  And you talked about  Not renewing a contract  But god  Who said that?  It's just so  How do you know that  He's unhappy? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah  Have we buds from another life?  You gave an interview  I read an interview  Where you were saying  That's a bullshit interview  That was  In an interview  I heard the fact  You ain't renewing  You're a contour rat  Listen  When I was in Wimbled Alley  This year  I thought about it  No  I don't know what happened  In that interview  I don't think I even really did that one  Yeah  Being unhappy  I mean  What can you be unhappy about?  You're working  Doing your dream job  And having a great life  Because of it  I mean  Things never go 100%  The way you want it to go 
[02:36:30]  But I mean  That's work  And I mean  Triple H is  I mean  He's the star of the show  On our show  And that's how he's  Promoted at  And that's how he's pushed  And that's kind of  The guy that they're going with  Similar to  Hulk Hogan was  You know  10 years ago  Maybe someday  Triple H will have  His own record  Triple H and Triple Heaven  I'm not sure  So politically correct  Anyway  Let's not be politically correct  I'm just telling you  I mean  That's just the way it is  You either like it  Or you don't like it  Or whatever  But you have to deal with it  Because that's the guy  Who's got the gig right now  Just like  In any job you have 
[02:37:00]  Somebody will get  The promotion  Someone will get the  You know  Be the senior vice president  Are they the best man for the job?  I guess we'll find out and see  But that's kind of the way  That the world works  Booking 101 says  When you have a new champion  All eyes  The focus of the show  Should be around him  Not the ex-champion  Trying to get his belt back  They've been doing that  For the last five years  Ever since I was a champion  It was like that  When Ben was a champion  It was like that  Exactly  That's the whole promotion  That's why the ratings  I'm not saying  It's the right way to do things  I'm saying that's the way it is  Either you accept it  Or you just quit 
[02:37:30]  You know what I mean  That's kind of how  You have to deal with it  Or you just go work  At McDonald's  Or something I guess  Hey guys real quickly  I want to be a Hulkamaniac  The bugs are going to get us  How'd that song go  By the retarded kids  Oh you better watch out  Or the insects  Yeah  Yeah it almost sounded like that  Didn't it  Yeah thanks guys  Thanks man  Is that a real song?  Yeah there's a song  You've never heard the insect song?  No  It was done by the  Can we find that?  What was the school name?  The kids of  Yeah here it is  Kids of Wheatley High  Or something like that 
[02:38:00]  Listen to this  And it's a bunch of  Mentally challenged children  Retards  They put together  An album  Opie  Mentally challenged  Or retards  And it sounds better  Than the Hulksters  You better watch out  Every insect against you  Oh my gosh  Poor kids  Poor kids  Poor parents  Oh this isn't that album  I thought it was the retarded  This is actually from the first ten rows of the wrestling 
[02:38:30]  As a garden  The other night  But what do they tell these poor kids?  Is that the insects are going to get them and eat them alive?  Yeah isn't that kind of creepy?  I know  If they make this song  It's like what influence  It's like Catholic school  Be good or I'll throw some bugs in your bed  Right and they will kill you  Son of a bitch  Yeah  But why are we playing this now?  I know you are  When there's other  There's better music we can be listening to  So you're going to be re-signing with the WWE there Chris? 
[02:39:00]  Well my contract is up in about eight months  And if you ask me today  I'd say absolutely not  We just got back from Australia on Sunday  If you can hear the funk in my voice  I'm dead sick  I was home for six days  And now we've got to go back to England for another two weeks  Going to wing on over to London  And jam with the stone  We have jam on over the  Yeah  My dad's a TV repairman  He's got an awesome set of tools  That's what I'm doing  Winging on over there  And actually we're jamming with Fozzy in Germany  We have a German tour  But we've got to go to Scotland and England and Germany  Before that with the WWE 
[02:39:30]  So the wheel never ends  I'm the hamster on the wheel  Going for my little pellet of grain  And it just goes and goes and goes  So sometimes it kind of gets to you in that respect  You book the gigs that coincide with where you're going to be with the wrestling  Sometimes  But this German tour came up before we even actually had this tour  So I was able to kind of piggyback it together  Yeah  But a lot of times we do shows after a wrestling show  We have a show in New York coming up on July 11th  At B.B. King's right after the Raw show at the Garden  So we do that quite a bit  We play a Fozzy show after the Raw show was done 
[02:40:00]  It's kind of connected to you there  So he said he's not going to resign if asked today  Let's see what's going to happen is now on the internet  It's like Jericho says  I know  I heard it, man  And all the people at the office will read it and go  Hey, Jericho's not resigning, man  All these guys get their exclusive interview  Exclusive info from the internet  That's right  Wrestling is one of those things that's just huge  With rumors being spread on the internet  Oh, it's so bad  It's probably one of the worst industries  And a lot of these people that do it  Are like literally 14 and 15 year old kids 
[02:40:30]  They're controlling everything  Yeah, and the kids are controlling the world  And the guys read it and believe it  You know, some guys don't know if they've had a good match or not  Until they read the internet to tell them  Oh, you guys are reading those things  And going, oh, motherfucker  Yeah, fuck, I suck this week  Oh, man, you know, a lot of guys do that  They read the internet to see, you know  We read every day  We have this called instant feedback  And people are able to put in comments  Responses to what we're saying  Critiques of the show  Funny lines, things like that  And on any given day 
[02:41:00]  You could read  Like right next to each other  You guys rule  Just start listening to the show  You're the funniest thing  I've ever heard on the radio  The next post down  Why are you wasting my time  Right  Which is shit  You guys suck  So to actually take any of it seriously  Instead of just do what you do on a daily basis  And enjoy yourself the most you can  To read that and take it to heart  And take it to heart  Holy shit  And that's the thing  Jump off a building  Well, totally  And as a professional  You know whether you've had a good show  Right  Inside  So we don't need people to tell us  You don't need to tell you  We already know 
[02:41:30]  It's nice to hear if it was good  But I mean, you know  You could get like some guys  That was a great show  And you know  Stunk on ice  It's the same thing with  With my radio show  That I have  On XM  On Da Boneyard  On Da Boneyard  I'll get  Like, you know  Play some different tunes  Some more obscure stuff  And a lot of people  Like, this is great  You play stuff that we never heard  Or we haven't heard in a long time  And other people will be like  I hate all this shit  What are you doing?  You know, play  You know  Pour some sugar on me  Or something stupid like that  Pull your finger out of your ass  And stop playing  Shut the fuck  Exactly  I'll do what I do  That's why I got the gig  In the first place  That's why you guys are here  That's why  You know 
[02:42:00]  That's why you get to a certain position  Yeah  You don't need someone to tell you  If it's good or bad or not  So, anyways  How am I doing on this show so far?  And that's Sundays at 8pm  Sundays at 8pm on Da Boneyard  What channel are we on right now?  202  Okay  We're hidden  When you turn on your X  I noticed this over the weekend  They have added so many channels  For the Major League Baseball thing  Yeah  When you first power up your unit  It takes a while  For it to get 202 into the system  Are you kidding really?  I swear to God  Are we buried?  What's around us?  We're like the Easter egg  I think there's like 
[02:42:30]  Yeah  Easter egg station  I think it goes 202  And then goes 205 Playboy, right?  And then all the traffic channels  Traffic  Because those are  Because people are just listening  To those channels like crazy  What's the Playboy channel?  That's the last premium channel they have  But what is it though?  Like chicks talking and stuff?  Yeah  It's cool for about five minutes  Yeah  Who wants to hear them talk  When you can't see them, right?  Yeah  It's like phone sex  I mean, you know  For a goof  You tune in every once in a while  And a girl's, you know  Telling some dirty story  It'd be like being blind  And watching a porno  Oh, okay  Pretty much the same thing 
[02:43:00]  You're blind guy  You're watching porno  And they want some fat chick from Hoboken  Like she's like 45 years old  Yeah, probably  With three kids on each teat  Like the old phone sex people  That's right, exactly  Those phone sex things that were exposed  Like on Maury or something  And we have our phone sex operators  Here today  And they're all these pigs  Talking about how  They get these guys off with their voice  You know what I was watching the day  We just had Wrestlemania  And Roddy Piper was on  They were showing a bunch of  Classic Roddy Piper clips  And they had Morton Downey Jr.  Oh, yeah  Do you remember that guy?  Of course  Do you remember how much controversy he caused  When he first came out? 
[02:43:30]  Like he was like the biggest asshole  How silly does it look now?  Now it's like so funny, right?  At the time he had that cigarette  And he'd blow smoke in their face  Listen, Buster!  Yeah  He's like someone's angry dad  That's right  He's just yelling all crotchety and grumpy  Anytime anyone's having any fun  He's there to knock it off  Stop it  Turn that down  God got him back though  Because he was blowing that smoke  In everyone's face  To make his point  And he dies of lung cancer  Lung cancer, right?  Got the lung cancer  There you go  It's a lung cancer  Anti-smoking thing before he died  Like, you know, I was wrong 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah  Well, they told her, yeah  Oh, really?  He went back on his smoking past?  Wow  Well, after the doctor tells you  You have lung cancer  I think you start doing  I better start being good  Yeah, that's right  You know?  The best anti-smoking ad ever  Was Yul, uh  Yul Brenner  Yul Brenner  Talking about how he's dead now  Oh, he did it before he died?  Yeah, he taped it before he died  It was the creepiest thing  All of a sudden  He's like, I'm dead now  Like this emaciated Yul Brenner  And then tells you  The reason why he's now dead  Wow  Even though he was still alive  When he, uh  That's pretty heavy  I'm surprised they showed that  Well, it was  Before everything got so PC 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, you could get away with that  Like in the late 70s, early 80s  But now you've never allowed that, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I don't know  Because anti-smoking they might  Anything that kind of  Goes hand-in-hand with their own thinking  They'll allow you to do it  If it's anti-smoking  They'd probably  It's got to be  No, no  Because you know what it is?  It's got to be  Uh, more politically correct  Because even though it's anti-smoking  It's almost like  Exploitation of this poor guy  That was, uh  That was fed these cigarettes  By the tobacco company  Right, right  He's the victim  But look at the drunk driving ads  They show  They show all these  Like little video games  That's true 
[02:45:00]  Oh, don't you know  Those are miserable  You ever get roped into one of those?  Yeah  You see and you're like  What?  Oh, look at the cute little kid  On the swing  Dog, dead  Murdered  Whoever did that  Is a jinxed  That is the most brilliant  Advertising  Oh, man  Yeah, that's heavy  That gets to you  Yeah, you gotta stop  You're jerking off  You're like  Alright, I gotta quit  I gotta stop through this one  The whole family's singing  Happy birthday  It's the kids' first birthday  Oh, I know  Yeah, it's a little awful  This kid's singing  Don't drink and drive  Ladies and gentlemen  He's in front of that big cake  Oh  Oh, it's just the worst 
[02:45:30]  That's brutal  I curse my TV  When that stuff comes on  They rope you in like that  Why are you making me feel bad?  Yeah, those are miserable  So  Oh, man, jeez  I put an end to that conversation  Certainly did  What a downer, Chris  Yeah, I know  Thanks, guys  So  Hey, you gotta back time  Any suicides to report today?  You gotta back time  Because we want to play Enemy today  The whole song  Yep, from Fozzy  Which means we only have a couple minutes  Man, this has gone by fast  It's already almost 11 o'clock  We had a real fast show today  I don't know if we got anything  The show blew on by 
[02:46:00]  Well, we took like  I think three breaks  The whole show  That's great  That's the beauty of XM  You don't need to  No, we talked about an hour and a half  At one point  Without stopping  Ask Chris about Lita  Banging Edge  Behind Matt Hardy's back  Ooh  Watch him squirm  Watch who squirm?  Me?  I don't know  I'm not squirming about shit, man  It's a shitty situation  And it's wrong  And it shouldn't have happened  Yeah  And, you know  I'm not squirming about it  I got nothing to be ashamed of  But it's bad business, man  Yeah  They fired Matt Hardy  As a result 
[02:46:30]  How could you be sitting at home  Rehabbing your knee  And a month later  You lose your girlfriend  And your job  For doing nothing wrong  You know what I mean?  That is rough  Yeah, it's the shit  That's, you know  Alright, there you go  There you go  So squirm on that  John Q  It's John Q  From Wackbag  Wackbag?  Wackbag is one of the websites  That we get critiqued on  All the time  That we were talking about earlier  And we put the ones  That rule the world  And we pretend we don't read  Yeah  That's right  Yeah, exactly  And that we read every post  And they say we don't 
[02:47:00]  And we respond under pseudonyms  Pseudonyms  Dude, so China's clit  Oh, Jesus  Oh, yeah, wow  There you go  Wow  Yay or nay  It wrote a song, I heard  Two guys in this room  Say no fucking way  One guy saying  It's the hottest thing ever  Okay, first of all  I've never watched that  Oh, you want it?  We got it right here  I can't  I can't  But it's bad when China's clit  Is bigger than Xbox penis  Yeah  That's the truth, right?  Very comparable, both of them  And you like that?  I like a big  I don't like the piercing  Piercings always irritate me 
[02:47:30]  But I like a fucking midget thumb clit  I really like a big, nasty  So let me ask you a question  If you give the midget clit, like, head  Does that make you gay?  No, because there's a pussy attached to it  Of course not  Okay  But it's the same motion, though  Uh-huh  It doesn't matter  So is nodding  I mean, if I think something's an affirmative  I'm a homo  If you have a banana in your mouth  While you do it  It's a different story  If you're nodding  Oh, it's not  It's not bad  It's a total different thing  Nodding, hello, hello, hello  You should see him eat a banana  He grabs the back of his head  Pushes into it  I like a big clit 
[02:48:00]  I've always liked a big clit  I've always liked  Because I like pussy  And the more of it there is  The happier I am  Yeah, but that isn't more of it  That's, ugh  Yeah, that's like  That's like a skin flap  That you get a skin tag  When you, like, you know  Have to get, like, cut off  Like a third nipple or something  Yeah, exactly  Take it off  It's not supposed to be right  It's like a spleen  It's not supposed to be there  It has no function whatsoever  I like it big, man  Big and thick and meaty  That's what I like  Ooh, dude  With some nice testicles  Hanging under it  Yeah  No, no, I don't want a bag under it  Push in the face  That awful little vagina  That looks like an Asian eye  Who can, what do you do with that? 
[02:48:30]  You're fucking, blah  You're done with it  You want it to be  You're done with it  In proportion  No, I don't  You want it to be in proportion  You want to be able to use  A tongue on it  Without being able to use  Like your lips  And move your head back  And forth like that  You don't want to actually  Gag on it  Yeah, right  That's the number one rule  The number one rule  Cuddlingus is do not gag on it  You don't want to gag on it  When I come within three inches of a pussy  You ever see Alien?  How it grabs your face?  That's what I want to do  Oh, you want to drop out of the egg  And just hold my face and pull me in  When you come within three inches of China's pussy  You're there  Because it's got extra three inches 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, there it is  I really like that  What am I looking at here?  That's it  Oh, dude  That's the reaction  That's actually a little bigger than I like  That's brutal  That was a natural reaction from Chris Jordan  Isn't that just insane?  If you just saw this bottom picture  It looks like my son's genitalia  A small penis and a sack  Yeah  That's disgusting  I don't know  You've crossed the line  Opie and Anthony  You wouldn't work on that for a few minutes, Sean? 
[02:49:30]  Oh, nice  Work on it with a belt sander  That's right  Put it down to reasonable size  Anything, Sean?  That is disgusting  That is a bruschon's just threw up in the corner  That is sick  Oh, hello  This is Miss Swan  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  All of it is so bad  It's hard to tell which is the worst  Hold on  We've got to interrupt the show  Oh  Ricky's back  Ricky  We're in the middle of doing a bit here  Ah  Seltzer, my friend  No club soda? 
[02:50:00]  There wasn't club soda?  Hold on, what?  We've got to turn your mic on  Oh, boy  Uh, what?  No, there wasn't any club soda over there  I was looking around the store for a while  That's why it took me a little bit  Yeah  See, I'm on a low-sodium diet  Do you see 25 milligrams of sodium in that?  Club soda has no sodium  That's the difference  Still bubbly water  But, you know  One or two is fine  But three?  Seltzer steaks, dude  Yeah  Yeah  I mean, I'll keep it here or something 
[02:50:30]  But, you know  Ah  Get a buck  Oh, my God  This is, like, wasting the whole show today  Yeah, I know  Sorry  Sorry, dude  I don't know  Maybe I told you  Ricky, you think you're cut out for this gig?  You're killing me  I'm trying my best  I'm trying to do what I can  There you go  Yeah, club soda  You keep that  You keep that  Well, I don't even know where we were  All right, let's start the whole bit over again  Oh, boy 
[02:51:00]  You want to replay the audio?  I don't know  Eric, did you interview him before we hired him to be an intern?  He seems reliable  Yeah  Holy ass  The audio's off out there, right?  Oh, my God  Yeah  I feel bad  I can't even do this  Don't separate yourself from the group, Anthony  I can't help it  He's going to spit in your club soda like Kizzy  I know, right? 
[02:51:30]  You did say club soda, though  He's gone?  Yeah  Club soda, seltzer  It's no difference  I don't care  It's not called seltzer water, can he?  And you try to say how you can't drink seltzer  And there's an empty one right next to you  There's three of them next to me  Yeah  If I have to worry about 25 milligrams of sodium  All right  What do we need next?  We're running out of things  We need things  Things  Things  Did he get your apple today yet? 
[02:52:00]  No, I didn't  All right  Very good  He could probably really screw up  All right  I think he's going to come back with a nice crisp apple  Don't even say it's crisp  I won't say a word  Okay  Dude, and then throw it against the wall when he comes in  Please  Dude  Throw it against the wall  Even if it's crisp  And walk out  Yeah, and walk out  And walk out of the studio  All right  Please  All right, here's another clip  He's not going to come back with a crisp one, by the way  Of course he's not  Of course he's not  It's going to have the consistency of something you find in a dumpster behind a Planned Parenthood  Should this have two little eyes in it? 
[02:52:30]  Little mouth-worn ears  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  Send to a 2  The Opie and Anthony Show  Let's say hi to Matt Hardy  Hey Matt  Yes sir, what's up man?  How are you guys?  How are you buddy?  Very good  I was very surprised to get an email from you, I gotta tell you  Yeah, you know, it's quite a big story these days  A lot of people were talking about it 
[02:53:00]  And, you know, Chris was on your guy's show  And it was addressed  And I was very happy that Chris stuck up for me, so to say  And just wanted to buzz you on it  No worries  I gotta start by saying, you know, the Hardy Boys  When I was watching wrestling, you know, on a regular basis  I mean, you guys were right up there as far as my favorites go  Thanks man  Yeah, I mean, we really, we made tag team wrestling cool again back in the day  Yep, the ladder matches and all of that stuff is just insane  Yeah, I mean, you know, both Jeff  And I, we gave the WWE everything inside our body, you know, night in and night out 
[02:53:30]  Now what, let's get right into it  Why did they, why did they let you go?  Well, as you just kind of said the situation before  I found out that my girlfriend of, you know, five or six years  Had become involved in a relationship  Which was the agenda of Adam Copeland, which is Edge  Obviously he had some sort of agenda going into this thing  And I found out something had happened  And Amy, who was leading, knew she got herself into a situation that she really shouldn't have 
[02:54:00]  And she was kind of trying to back out  And this guy was putting the pressure on her  And there was actually, the weekend I found out about her  She had gone the whole weekend and not spoke to her  And he had just piled up messages on her phone  Just real pitiful messages  Just, you know, I love you, I love you  If you're going to be with Matt and not with me  Then I don't have a reason to be here  And just absurd stuff  Wow, really?  Yeah, just like psychotic level stuff  Wait, so we're talking about Edge and Lita?  Yes  All right, and is Edge  And Edge, you know, who was leaving these messages  Once she was kind of trying to get her head right  At the end, you know, is a guy who's married 
[02:54:30]  Who has a wife at home  His second wife  All right, so Edge has a wife at home  You were seeing Lita for five or six years?  Yeah, we'd been seeing each other serious  We'd known each other for six years  We'd probably been serious for four to four and a half years  All right, and then behind your back  She starts fooling around with Edge?  Yeah, Edge has an agenda  She was by herself on the road  He asked, oh, can I ride with you?  I'll take care of you  All right, all right, wait, we've got to slow down here  So, okay, Lita's on the road  And so 
[02:55:00]  I'm actually out injured at this point  I had, you know, my left knee  I had complete reconstructive surgery on my left knee  Just from years of wear and tear  Just being a wrestler, being with the WWE  So it's got to be tough to begin with  To be a female wrestler on the road  You know  Sure  Now she's on the road  And she's traveling by herself  Because we always travel together  Right  And there came a point up  Where this guy had been one of my closest friends  For so many years  And it's like  I would have trusted him with my life  Wow  At this point  And then when  She was going to ride with him 
[02:55:30]  I was going, well, that's cool  Because, you know, now she'll be fine  Because there's a guy with us  All right, okay  So you're at home and thinking  Okay, now Edge is going to, you know  Travel with Lita  That's exactly something I would want  Because I know both people very well, right?  Yeah  Just like the same thing  If I traveled with his wife  It would never go through my mind  Because that's the kind of relationship we had  Right  It's like a brother type relationship  Guys don't do that to each other  Right  Oh, man  That's the biggest taboo in any business  Especially the rest of me  Exactly  So then all of a sudden  You're starting to get an idea  That maybe she's fooling around on you  Well, I just 
[02:56:00]  Actually, his wife contacted me  And said there were some weird text messages  Oh, boy  And then I'd ask about it  Nothing was going on  And like I said  She obviously knew that she  Had got herself into a situation  She couldn't get out of  And I think she was regretful  I don't think Edge was  You know, that's the big thing there  And then once I discovered  These messages from Edge  That he'd called and left her  All during the weekend  He'd called and left five or six messages  Like a psycho  And, you know, I questioned her about it  She was asked to leave the house 
[02:56:30]  At that point  And then, you know, him  I spoke to him actually after that  Like, you know  You know, what in the hell are you thinking, man?  You know, like  What a piece of shit  You know, why would you do this?  And he's like  Oh, buddy, you know  I'm sorry  You know, I messed up  You know, you guys can still work things out  Da-da-da-da-da  And then he would get off the phone  Right after that  And I know he'd call her and say  Yeah, I know that was bad  But he's gone now  We can be together  We can be together  Jesus Christ  Are you kidding me?  No, I mean  This is the kind of guy we're dealing with here  So they fooled around  How many times, you think? 
[02:57:00]  Was it an ongoing thing?  It was a pretty brief thing  All right  So it was a brief thing  She's lonely on the road  And then, you know  Unfortunately, it happened  But then she realized  She made a mistake  Yeah  Yeah, definitely  But, you know  By this point  It was obviously too late  You know  Because all this stuff had gone on  And then I'm making my return  I'm rehabbing  I've been busting my ass for six months  To get back to the company  To the WWE  The company I love  The company I've given everything for  And, you know  I have a couple of appearances here and there  Then these appearances start  You know 
[02:57:30]  They get canceled  And the reason why  Is they're worried  Because of a physical confrontation  Obviously between me and Edge  You know  Because obviously  This guy wants to do anything he can  Not to face me  And he still does  And he's still married  And now he wants Lita  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But how does Edge have that kind of pull  In the company  That if they don't want some kind of  Problems between you two  To get you out of the picture  Well, I don't know  Well, that's the thing  I don't know if he really does have that pull  But  It's just like 
[02:58:00]  He was on TV  You know  He was in the midst of  Having a lot done with him  You know  He was in the midst of a push  And she's been on TV as well  I'm just the odd man out  Because I've been sitting at home  For six months  Right  You know  So then  Once the story starts breaking  And another thing  Maybe  You know  I was so outraged  When I heard all this  Maybe I didn't handle everything  Perfectly right  Because  You know  Once people start talking  About this story  I went ahead and defended myself  You know  I went ahead and let people know  Like this was the situation  And  You know  It's a fucked up situation  All the way around  You know 
[02:58:30]  But I'm not the bad guy  And this is what happened  You know  And I'm not ashamed of doing that  Because I wasn't going to look like  The bad guy  Right  In such a terrible situation  Alright  So you don't want to get back  With Lita at all  Right now  I speak with her on a social level  And that's pretty much where it is  And you're really pissed off  That she cheated on you  Obviously  And what would you do to Edge  If you saw him?  I probably shouldn't say that on the air  So you're still  You're still beyond angry  And he was one of your  Better friends  In the company right?  Beyond  Beyond anger 
[02:59:00]  And then  You know  Just with the WWE  You know  It came to a point  Where it was just  I think  Just like Chris said  It was real bad business  Because I'm the guy  That was the odd man out  I was sitting at home  And the easy way  To get out of the situation  Without having a confrontation  Was to release me  And let my deal run out  Can you imagine Anthony?  I mean  You leave the company  Because you got an injury  You got your chick  That's still in the company  Still in the company  And you're at home  Just rehabbing  And you have nothing to do with it  She ends up cheating on you  And now the company  Releases you 
[02:59:30]  Because that's the easy way to do it  Insult to injury man  Literally  And it's just  It's just brutal  On so many levels  And you know  If they were upset with me  Addressing the situation  Or if they were worried  About a physical confrontation  If they would have set  The three of us down  And  Well what do you mean  By address the situation?  What did you say about this  Publicly?  I mean  I just clear up the situation  I just said  Well this is what's happened  Once words started  I mean dude  We're celebrities  We're in the  You know  We're in the public eye  And this situation 
[03:00:00]  Was going to get out anyway  You know what I'm saying  As far as like  On the internet and what not  And when this situation  Was addressed  Well this is  You know  There was never  Problem between  Lita and I  At all  Zero problems  The whole time  During a relationship  So people didn't turn  Into a situation  Like  Oh well Matt was abusive  Towards her  Or Matt was this  Or Matt was that  No there was no problems  At all  Right  That's what I'm saying  Do you understand?  Yeah I do understand that  You know  I didn't want that  To come out  Well you know  If the situation  Comes out  And they say  Well Lita and Edge  Are together  And then people say  Why is that?  You know  Did Matt beat her? 
[03:00:30]  Was he mean to her?  Was this?  Well because it was well  Well because it was well known  You were seeing her  Obviously  So it wasn't a private thing  We were like  We were a poster couple  Of the WWE  Because we'd been together  So long  Right right  You know  Our relationship was great  Because like I said  From day one  There had been zero problems  Less than zero  So it seems obvious to me  That you pretty much  Threatened Edge  Over this whole situation  And Vince  You know  Decided  This is how he's going to handle it  Because he doesn't want  Any confrontations  I guess right  Well I guess too  Also there was 
[03:01:00]  But who would blame you?  I mean  Every guy out there  Is probably nodding  At the radio  Going of course  I'm going to  You know  Defend myself  In a situation like this  Absolutely  I mean  You can even look at  I mean  Look at the locker room  Just like  Jericho's on your show  There's a ton of guys  Who just think  This is absolutely horrible  I mean  Just even  For running a locker room  What does that say  To the rest of your locker room  If this situation happens  To one of your most  Loyal employees  Is sitting at home hurt  And there's a situation  Where his girlfriend  And one of his better friends  Get involved in  In a relationship  And this guy 
[03:01:30]  Instead again  To come back to work  Ended up getting released  Make it paranoid  You know  And two  There was a couple  Other things  Like  There was one time  Edge was here  In Fedville  And then on the way  To Columbia  South Carolina  I think it happened  In Columbia  I'm not exactly sure  What happened  His tires were slashed  On his rental car  And for some reason  I got the blame  For that  Although I was  Two  You know  I was 200 miles away  At home  You know  And I don't know  If that were  You know  We're fans  Or you know  Whoever it was  I mean  There's a lot of people  That hate this guy  Especially coming off  This situation  Like you said before 
[03:02:00]  That's just like  Something that guys  Do not do  I mean  You're breaking  The guy code  Man  I mean  That's crazy  Yep  You know  One of your best friends  Banging your chick  That is  That just  Should never happen  You know  I mean  And this guy too  Once again  Like  You know  I spoke to his wife  A lot  He was just  Terribly  Just so  Mentally abusive  To his wife  It was just brutal  I mean  She's a real sweet girl too  And he just put her  Through the ringer  And like I said  He's 30 years old  This is the second time  He's been married  Getting ready to be over  I mean  Just  That pretty much  Says right there 
[03:02:30]  What the quality  Of this guy is  So you think  He's separated  From his wife right now  They're in the process  Of getting a divorce  I would say right now  And he still wants Lita  He's still working  That angle  I'm sure he is  I'm sure he's still  Trying to work it  You know  I think she's caught on  To his game  By this point  But yeah  He's definitely  Still trying to work it  Dude did you  Completely blow up at her  Because that's like  Yeah  How can you not  I mean  Of course  I've been the most  Driving force  In her career anyway  Like when she started  It was with myself  And my brother  Jeff Hardy  And you know 
[03:03:00]  Pretty much everything  She learned  From starting in the WB  Coming through  Was through me  You know  Well you guys  It's obvious  That's when I was  Watching a lot  You guys brought her up  Into the whole business  And made her  What she is today  So  And you know  I mean  It was very like  Once again  You said  This whole situation  Which is a real  Bullshit situation  Like when you watch  You know  Raw from MSG  I mean  They  You know  People in New York  They're the barometer  Of what wrestling  Is all about  Especially in the WB  And when you sit there  And you watch  20,000 people  Chant  You know 
[03:03:30]  You screwed Matt  And we want Matt  I mean  That's a message  That says something  That says what  Those people believe  And Vince hasn't  Said anything to you  No  I mean  I haven't been  Since I was notified  Of my release  I hadn't heard  Of anything  From the company  Right now  They haven't even  Contacted you  And what was the  Excuse for the release  They had to give you  Something  No  It was  It was  Not very much  We're going to  Look at some  Other guys  And do you think  You could wrestle  You think you could  Wrestle like you  Were wrestling  In the WWE  Oh even better 
[03:04:00]  Than that  So they can't  Use the excuse  That you're  You're  You're  A weaker product  No I mean  Right now  I'm healthier  Than I've ever been  I'm in the best  Shape I've ever been  I actually  I have more to offer  To the wrestling business  Right now  Than I ever have before  And you know  That we also have  Two branches  We have Raw and Smackdown  And if I would have  Went to Smackdown  And you know  Lita and Edge  Would have been on Raw  There'd never been  A problem won  Yeah it's like  Two separate camps  Right  Yeah you know  You don't even  Bump in at each other  A couple times  Yeah but it sounds  Like Vince is really  Really scared 
[03:04:30]  That there's going to  Be some crazy  Physical confrontation  I say let it happen  Yeah right  Bring it on  Put that in the  God damn ring  Yeah screw the  Quote fake stuff  Get a cage match  With you two  With you two  Kicking each other's ass  In a UFC match  Oh my god  Pay per view  Ultimate fighting  I will tell you this too  Like I even got to the point  Where right before  I was notified  Of my release  That I'd kind of  Come  Especially the first  Two or three weeks  Man as you can imagine  I was  It was like  Temporary insanity 
[03:05:00]  You know like  No shit  I was just a maniac  You don't have to tell  Anthony about that  I guess you guys  Know temporary  Insanity good  Yeah  But anyway man  I got to the point  Where I'd cool down  Like I said  I could be on a  Social level  With Lita  Even though I wasn't  Appreciative  Any of what she did  Obviously  Of course  But I would have got  To a point  Where I could have  Went to Smackdown  And I would have  Avoided all conflict  With him  And just went ahead  About daily life  As it was  And be professional  Do your job  And then be pissed off  When you're done  Unfortunately  Instead of sitting me down 
[03:05:30]  And just saying  Okay can you do this  Or will you do this  Or is there going to be  An altercation here  It was just like  Just such a cheap way out  Of just like  Giving me my release  And like okay  Well we're done with it  You know and it's just like  Man I mean I love  The WWE  And Vince McMahon  Has been great to me  Over all the years  It just  I hate it ended  On such a sour note  It was just a poor way  To end things  Well you know  I'm an outsider  But we have relationships  With a lot of you guys  And we've done a lot  For the WWE  WWF  All that crap  And it seems like  A lot of people 
[03:06:00]  Leave on a bad note  Over and over again  It just seems like  You know  People leave on a bad note  I don't really understand that  I don't think  I mean like  For this one  There should have been  No reason for it  You know  And  Well Vince looks at it  As a business  And unfortunately  He doesn't really care  About the personal crap  And he probably  You know I'm just  Playing devil's advocate  You know right  Right now Edge  Has more of a push  Because you were rehabbing  And out of the business  And Lita has more of a push  Because they're on TV  Every week still  So instead of really 
[03:06:30]  Looking at the situation  Just went ah  He's more popular  At this moment  So it's so much easier  Just to release Matt Hardy  Which is in my opinion  A huge shame  Absolutely  It sure is  I mean  And that's how it is  Especially like you said  You don't want to deal  With the social problems  Or whatever  But then once again  You look at that crowd  And if you're going to have Edge  And you're going to have  Lead out there  Week in and week out  And people are chanting  We want Matt  And you screw Matt  And they demand Matt  Because it's such a bullshit situation  That I was the victim in  Hey Matt  When did you really know  That she was effing on you 
[03:07:00]  What was the one thing  Where you went  Oh my god  Where you felt it  In the pit of your stomach  Honestly  It wasn't until  I got those phone messages  From Edge  That was the only proof positive  Because  What do you mean by the phone messages  From her machine  No  From her cell phone  Where he had  He'd left  All these phone messages  Just saying like  You know  Oh if I can't be with you  And you know  I can't sleep at night  And please don't be with Matt  And da da da  And how did you get those messages  I just pulled them off her phone 
[03:07:30]  Yeah  Oh my god  You got it  Obviously because you had  Your suspicions  Yeah  That was the only  But you know what  I've never done that  You know  If I would have  If I would have been  Our relationship was always so great  That we never even thought  Twice about that  With each other  You know  She was out for 16 months  With a broken neck man  And I was on the road  I never compromised  Her integrity at all  Because our relationship  Was so cool  Just because we were  Like best friends  What gave you the suspicions  In the first place  That you wanted to  Check her cell phone  Yeah  Yeah  Okay you're right  But just because  We had  Went through a couple days 
[03:08:00]  Where she just said  Like you know  I know  She said  My head's not where  It needs to be  And I need to figure things out  Uh oh  I know I'm messing up  And I was just like  You know  What is this all about  I've never heard this from you  Yeah  And that's what it was  She'd actually told him  That she didn't want to  Speak to him anymore  Because she wanted to get her head right  Because she knew she was screwing up  But by the time  She was going to get her head right  It was too late  Because I'd already heard  These messages from her  Matt I'm from the school  Of one screw up  And it's over Johnny  Right  It's like you know  You can't 
[03:08:30]  You just can never go back  And not think  First of all  That it's going to happen again  And just not get that  That deceit out of your head  It's uh  I'll tell you what man  It's just terrible  Because it takes  A really long time  To have something good  But it only takes  A very short time  To destroy it  That's it  Oh god damn  That is rough  What a screw job  Jesus  So uh  That's what's really bad  You know  It's like  In the course of  You know  Just a few weeks  I lost my dream girl 
[03:09:00]  And my dream job  Just both over bullshit reasons  You know what I mean  Wow  Wow  Well if it's any consolation  Uh  Opie and Jimmy  Are back together  As friends  I'll tell you what  That definitely makes my day  It puts a smile on my face  For the day  So what do you want to happen  Uh  I don't know  That's a good question  That's a very good question  It seems like  Has it split the league  I mean it seems like  There's more people  That are supporting you as well  Uh  Besides Chris Jericho  Right  Oh no  No question yeah  Man 
[03:09:30]  No question more people  Supporting me  Um  I mean  There's nobody  There's nobody  That supports him  There's nobody  That can sit behind him  And support him  Yeah  Hey did you and Alita  Make any tapes  Or anything in the bedroom  There might be a few  Floating around  That's always a good way  To get back  Yeah if you got one  Of those sex tapes  We could uh  You never know  It'll pop up  We could host it  On one of our websites  No problem for you  Oh thank you  No problem whatsoever  Jesus Christ  But uh  You know  I guess I'm at a point  Right now  You know  Uh  Thinking ahead  There are other places  To wrestle  You know 
[03:10:00]  If you can't wrestle  In the WWE  The WWE is by far  The biggest place  And best place to wrestle  And once again man  I love the WWE  And I have nothing  But good things to say  About my entire experience there  I just really hate  How it ended  And I thought  I think things  Should have ended differently  Is what I would say  You know  But there's  You know  There's definitely  Other places to wrestle  And my brother  Jeff Hardy  I actually just watched him  Last night  He was on TNA  They have a little  Wrestling show as well  They had a pay-per-view  And he enjoys  What he does down there  And there's several places  Across the world  And why is he out of the league  By the way  Uh 
[03:10:30]  He's been out for  A couple years now  Just uh  He was very very burnt out  With the WWE schedule  And uh  There were a couple things  That uh  He just  He just really couldn't  Continue to do  While wrestling with the WWE  So right now  He's at a deal  Where he only works  Two or three days  Every couple weeks  So he loves our schedule  He just likes to stay  At home all day  Wow man  And you really want  To just beat the hell  Out of uh  Out of that show  Well who wouldn't  He's my least favorite  Person in the world  I would definitely say that  And it would get ugly 
[03:11:00]  If you saw him on the street  It wouldn't be pretty  Um  But uh  That just shows his character though  Yeah I mean  It definitely shows  I mean you know  Well once again  Like I said man  And  To cheat with your  He's only been married  He's only been married  For three months  Like when this went down  Are you kidding me  He just got married  He just got married  On his second marriage  To cheat with your  Best friend's girl  That is  That's nuts  And you know  And he confessed to  Cheating on  On both his wives  Jesus  You know I mean  This guy's just a mess 
[03:11:30]  I mean this guy  Recently too  Like even  You know he was on  Uh  Off the record  A Canadian  Uh  TV show  You know he was  An admitted steroid user  On there  Just said that he'd used them  Before and that's why  They were illegal  Also when they were  Flying back  Overseas there was  One of the diva girls  That had a drink  Port on her  This was the guy  That did that  I mean he's done  A ton of  Just terrible things  As far as that goes  Does he have a lot  Of friends  True quality  Does he have a lot  Of friends in the WWE  No  Not now  Wow  God  And even if somebody  Is  You know even if 
[03:12:00]  Someone is social  With him  I mean really  What can you think  About a person  That has those  Characteristics  Right  Yeah  Man you got  Screwed bro  Yep  That's for sure  So I mean right  Now man just like  Just I'm sitting here  I guess you know  Now is the time  To promote myself  For me to promote  Matt Hardy  Well we got a  Huge audience  That loves wrestling  You want them  To chant anything out  Every time they  See Lita  Yeah I mean I  Think every time  They see Lita  Orage they should  Chant we want Matt  You screwed Matt  I mean it's just  A constant reminder  It's one thing  Like the whole thing  With Bret Hart  And the Montreal  Screwjob 
[03:12:30]  Just how they would  You know especially  The Canadians  And even here in the states  They would never  Stop chanting  You know you screwed  Bret you screwed  Bret  It was just nice  How they would  Never let the WWE  Forget that  Now that's some  Of the best video  Ever when Bret Hart  Spit on Vince McMahon  That was just amazing  And then Vince McMahon  What was it  They were filming  Some kind of documentary  In the WWF  When all that went down  And then they had  This thing happen  With Bret Hart  Too long to go into  Well basically  He was retiring  And they wanted him  To retire as a champion 
[03:13:00]  In front of his  In front of his  Hometown country  In front of his  In his country  In Canada  And at the last minute  Vince set up  A different storyline  Didn't tell Bret Hart  And gave the championship  To Triple H  I guess right  Yeah  It was Shawn Michaels  Actually  Shawn Michaels  I'm sorry  And so Bret Hart  Realized he got  A major screw job  In front of his  Hometown fans  Up there in Canada  Looked at Vince  And went  Oh my god  After all I did  For you  You screwed me  Spits in his face 
[03:13:30]  It had nothing to do  With the storyline  And then they turned  Off the cameras  As they went backstage  To talk about this  And all you see  Is Vince coming out  Of the locker room  Staggering  Because I guess  Bret Hart popped him  Really hard  Staggering with a shiner  It is some of the  Best best video  I've ever seen  Very funny  That whole documentary  On that thing  Yeah  It was a  It was a big deal  And you got it  You're pretty accurate  There in your description  Okay  Yeah  And rumor has it  Yeah  There was a huge  Convitation that  Unfortunately the cameras  Weren't rolling for 
[03:14:00]  And Bret Hart  You know gave Vince  A couple really  Really big shots  To the head  And he's staggering  Down the hall afterwards  That's when they  Turn the cameras back on  Yeah  So  Alright Matt  I appreciate your honesty  Man  Oh yeah  No problem man  I don't know  Coming on our show  If it's actually  Going to help you  But  But at least you get  Your side of the story  Out there  Well it's just  You know  I guess that's  Why I'm at right now  I mean if  I have to worry  About Matt Hart  Then I have to worry  About Matt Hart  Right  You know  It's just  You know the story  Is what it is man 
[03:14:30]  There's no denying  You want to  Have you been  Banging other broads  Since Lita now  Well I've just  Made the most  Of the time I have  Yeah you got to  Get back on the horse  My friend  I'll just leave it  To that  I've made the most  Of the time I have  There you go  I'd imagine  You're fucking  Like a rabbit  Who are you kidding  That's what you  Got to do  My friend  Yeah  Just going to buzz  To like actually  There's a  Company who has  Contacted me  Who's very interested  In sitting down  With myself and my brother  And I'm going to  Really sit down 
[03:15:00]  And tell the story  From A to Z  And then plus  We're going to sit back  And talk about  Our whole career  And it's going to  Be a really big deal  It's going to be  A big DVD set  And it's going to  Be available  In some different markets  In a mainstream way  So it's going to  Be a very interesting thing  I've got that project  Coming up in a couple weeks  And there's a ton of people  That have contacted me  All over about doing things  And you know  Who knows  You know  The stuff you guys  Did in the ring  Was just amazing  It was just amazing  It brought the tag team  To a whole other level  I mean jumping from  The top of those ladders  And I mean all that stuff  No one was doing that 
[03:15:30]  It was amazing  Yeah that was definitely  I remember  I think it was  I think it was  WrestleMania  When we went Anthony  In Sacramento  No it was Anaheim  Anaheim  We were basically  Invited by the WWF  It was WWF at the time  And Anthony and I  We were pretty much  In the second or third row  Yeah it's insane  And you  That was the match  Where you guys  You know  Somersaulted off the ladders  Yeah  But these ladders  Were extremely high  Not just a basic ladder  They were like 
[03:16:00]  I don't know  15, 17 feet up  And you somersault  Not into the ring  But you know  Outside the ring  Remember that  Yeah that was  My brother Jeff  Did a real big dive  On the aisle  I'm sure that's probably  The one you're talking about  But that was the first ever  Triple ladder match  It was a huge deal  But that's where  When I really truly  Had respect for what  You guys do  Because I remember  At the time  Looking at Jim Ross  Who was announcing the match  And the look on his face  Like I can't believe  He just did that  That's what we were doing too  We were going  We can't believe  We just did that 
[03:16:30]  Yeah  Because I mean  A lot of times  You guys make this stuff up  As you go  And I just remember  The faces of the people  That see this stuff  Every day  So they're kind of jaded  And I saw the looks  On their faces  Like did they just  Do what we just saw  And they weren't  Saying that on the air  To try to really  Push it over the top  This was just  Very natural reactions  And the cameras  Didn't capture that  Yeah  And that's when I realized  Man these guys are nuts  Yeah I mean  The first time  That we did  That was the first time  That we ever really  Did a match like that  Especially with three teams 
[03:17:00]  And just everybody  Was watching in awe  Because it was just like  Oh my god  What are these guys  Going to do next  Are they going to  You know  They really thought  We were going to  Kill each other out there  And we almost did  Kill each other  Yeah let's go to  Shwaggy real fast  Shwaggy  Hey Matt  How are you guys  Doing today  What's up  Hey Matt  Here's your chance  Man let's shoot back  On Triple H  After his comment  What did Triple H say  Because he's a fire  After his fire  Triple H was heard  Backstage saying  No big deal  He never drew any money  Anyhow  So Matt  Here's your chance  To shoot back  And please  Tell the world  All the marks  All the marks  Know  What it's really like  There with him 
[03:17:30]  Controlling everything  Well all I can say  I heard that comment  I don't know  If he truly said it  Or not  But I mean  If that is the comment  That he said  I mean  I think it's just  A pretty petty comment  I mean  You know  Matt Hardy  And Jeff Hardy  Were the Hardy boys  The tag team  And like  In the amount of time  We were together  As a tag team  No other tag team  Has sold that much merchandise  And there's no denying  The drawing power  That Jeff and I  Had together  I mean  We brought a whole new  Demographic  Into the WWE  And the wrestling business  I mean  For every  You know  We had a t-shirt  Constantly  We had merchandise 
[03:18:00]  Constantly  And we sold it  Like crazy  And we were drawing  I mean  There were people  Young girls  Especially  That paid  To see Matt Hardy  And Jeff Hardy  I mean  So right there  You can already  Said that  You know  That I have made  Money for the company  And then even  As a singles wrestler  When I was doing  Matt Hardy  Version 1  The Sensate Mattitude  I mean  There was a point  Where I was the  Hottest thing on Smackdown  Especially when I was  Doing that  Cruiserweight title  Sensate Mattitude  Yeah  And then even  You know  I wasn't given  The ultimate opportunity  To like  Become a top level draw  But even with what  I was given  I made the most of it  And there were still  People that paid  To see me  And I always had 
[03:18:30]  Merchandise  Will you shoot on him  Though about the way  Will you shoot on him  About the way  He just controls the  Backstage  Being married to Stephanie  Does he really  You know Matt  You know  What's going on  About how he's  Promoting himself  Over Batista  How he does it  Over all the other  Champs  Just so he can  Get his belt back  I mean  Come on  The whole show  Revolves around him  And it really  Shouldn't be that way  And Jericho  Wanted to say it  Last week when he  Was on  But you know  That's the way  It should be  You're saying  Because Triple H  Is married to  Vince McMahon's  Daughter  That he's  Really really  Controlling stuff  Oh without a doubt  He controls  Almost everything 
[03:19:00]  That goes on  If you watch the show  Whenever a new champ  Is crowned  Booking 101  Says that the new champ  Should be out to  All others  He should be made  As the champion  Everyone else  As the challenger  The way it's been  Over the last few  Champions  Interim champions  It's been all about  Triple H  And how he's going  To get his belt back  And it's so obvious  Because the next  Pay-per-view  What's coming up  It's being  Billed as  Triple H  Batista 2  And Triple H  Has all the camera time 
[03:19:30]  Now granted  Batista's not the best  On the mic  But Triple H  Not this  Not last week  The following week  Open the show  With a 20 minute promo  Saying about how great  He was  And you don't do that  I mean he's stroking  His own ego  And Matt  I know you probably  Will never do it  Because I know  You want to go back  To work  You probably eventually  Want to get back there  But you know  That's the way it is  Well I mean  I don't think  It's any secret  I mean the show  Revolves around Triple H  But you know  One thing that you do say  I think like  When you have Benoit 
[03:20:00]  And Batista  As the champions  I mean I really think  You do need to focus  On them as being  The most important thing  On the show  Alright let's take  One more call  Then we gotta move on here  Jeff in Philly  What's up  Hey guys  Hey  Matt  Yes  I'm gonna be honest  With you  I just love how  You ruined the  Half hour of this show  This is horrible radio  Thank you  Horrible radio  I'm glad you enjoyed  It that much  I totally disagree  Because it's  You know  You don't have to  Like wrestling  To get into this  This subject  Appreciate real life drama 
[03:20:30]  No shit  Jesus Christ  This stuff  The stuff that's  Being described  As you know  Matt's situation  The situation  With Triple H  Being married  To the boss's daughter  And that having  An influence  Over what goes on  It blows away  Any of the  Written storylines  In wrestling  Believe me  You can't write  Stuff this good  No  This is the stuff  The real life drama  That's going on  Behind the scenes  Yeah  Because somebody's  Saying this guy  Joe from South Jersey  Is going  For God's sake  It's not real  No we're talking  About the real stuff 
[03:21:00]  Not the storylines  That are happening  In wrestling  You asshole  People aren't stupid  Enough to think  That this is a storyline  They think we're  Discussing like  A wrestling storyline  No this is the  Behind the scenes  Stuff that's really  Happening  This is a  Yeah he was  He was going out  With Lita for five years  He's home  You know  Recovering from an injury  And his quote  One of his best friends  Or a friend  On the road  Is banging his trick  Yeah this guy  That's not a storyline  This guy doesn't realize  We're talking about  Real life here  Joe Wagner from  South Jersey  You fucking tool  Jesus man 
[03:21:30]  How'd that guy get on  Exactly  Alright Matt  Alright well cool  Well definitely  It was nice chatting  With you guys  Yeah Matt  Keep us updated man  Let us know  What's going on  Most certainly  We'll all keep you updated  You never know  What turn this  Huge story's going  To take next  I'm telling you  It's just  It's unbelievable  That this is my life  It's the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  We're back with the

[03:29:00]  Alright  Okay  I don't think it's in tune  I don't know the fingering  It's not working  Johnny, grab my hand  Grab, grab the bass  Hey everybody, it's Stephen Lynch 
[03:29:30]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  And also, I have herpes  Alright  Nervous about this one  You're the love of my life  But it cuts like a knife  And I feel that I'm being misled  See, I'm a little concerned  For I recently learned  Of the swastika tattoo on your head  And it makes you smile  When you hear Sieg Heil 
[03:30:00]  You love the smell of a burning cross in the yard  You do goose-step salutes  In your Doc Martin boots  And you quoted Mein Kampf  In our fifth anniversary card  I think you're a Nazi, baby  Are you a Nazi?  I think you're a Nazi, maybe  You keep extensive files  On the Nuremberg trials 
[03:30:30]  And you watch them whenever they're airing  I guess I should've known  When you bought a new bone  For your puppies  Named Goebbels and Goering  And you showed up late  To our very first date  I said, how are you?  You said, white power  Call me paranoid  But I'm not overjoyed  When you ask me  If I want to shower  I think you're a Nazi  Don't be lying, baby 
[03:31:00]  Tell me if you're a Nazi  Are you anti-Zion, maybe  Your reverie dress is monogrammed  SS  You hold an annual Tom Metzger bash  And it makes me irate  When you say I look great  If I wear a little tiny mustache  Your social politics  Say that races don't mix 
[03:31:30]  And you call it pure blood pollution  And whenever I'm sad  You say it's not so bad  For every problem  There's a final solution  I think you're a Nazi  Give me an answer, baby  Are you a Nazi?  You drive a fucking Panzer, baby  They say that love is blind 
[03:32:00]  So how could I have guessed?  But then again  But then again  I met you at the Wagner Fest  I know you're a Nazi  I know you're a Nazi  And that's why I'm leaving  I know you're a Nazi  I know you're a Nazi  Sure as my name is  Steven Lynch  Bergstein 
[03:32:30]  That's a Nazi song  That's a sweet song  I like it  That girl sounds nice  It's the worst  All right, Grey Wolf  Give us a little something  You're going to have to sing it  You want to do a little duet, you think?  Tippy Tom, you jump in when you can  I'm scared, I'm scared  I'm scared  All right  You sing and I'll play  Stairway 7 
[03:33:00]  Stairway 7  Oh, whatever  Something like that  This is the best show on me  It smells like shit in there  I don't know the lyrics yet, but I'll try. 
[03:33:30]  In my heart, I will give it a try.  It's only the most famous song ever.  And I'm sorry.  I'm trying to get the same thing to work. 
[03:34:00]  All right, well, let it rip, Tom.  It's like fixing a car.  Let it rip, Tom.  Here we go.  Tippi Tom singing the Rolling Stones.  Tippi Tom will do it.  Yeah.  You got it.

I'm holding Al Shalom.  Lord, I miss you.  I'll do the best I can.  I'll do the best I can.  I'll do the best I can.  I'll do the best I can.  I'll do the best I can.  I'll do the best I can.  I'll do the best I can.  Hey!  Lord, I miss you.  Don't you know that I really miss you? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah!  Come on, Tom.  Nice.  Because my heart is so out of shape.  Because you've been gone and you're out of my face.  Hey!  Come on, Tom.  Keep rocking.  Lord, I miss you.  Yes, I miss you.  Don't you know I miss you? 
[03:35:30]  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's wrong, Tiffy?  No!  I can't.  What's wrong, Tom?  No.  Oh, it is solo.  I want you to do something different.  All right, you do something different.  And Eric, someone's got to hold the mic for Grey Wolf because he's going to do a little flute  solo.  We're making music on the fly here, all right?  It's a little time for us.  I want to use that if we haven't recorded.  Hey, Grey Wolf, would you let Tom play your flute? 
[03:36:00]  How you do I?  You can't get no sound out of it.  I tried every one of them.  All right.  Give me the best time.  I always sing with Tom all the time.  Hey!  He's one of my oldest buddies on a tape from that world.  Grey Wolf, shh.  Let Tiffy Tom play.  Hold on.  Tiffy Tom.  I know, I know, I know.  You don't love me.  Tom, I'm with you.  I'm with you.  Here we go.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  You don't love me.  Tom, Tom, this is what's going to happen.  I want to hear your music.  You play again, and this is what's going to happen. 
[03:36:30]  But Grey Wolf, when you're feeling it, you jump in with that flute solo.  All right.  Here we go.  Tiffy Tom on the Opie and Anthony program.  I can't get my fingers together.  You're sounding great.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Tiffy Tom.  How do you tune it?  It's all wrong.  It's out of tune, man.  It's out of tune.  It's out of tune.  I feel unhappy.  I'm going to break this guitar over my head. 
[03:37:00]  Tom, do you know any songs?  Do you know any songs?  I don't know nothing right.  That's a Tiffy Tom original, Anthony.  Tom, don't you know any songs?  This Grey Wolf guitar is stupid.  All right.  Here we go.  We got one more.  One more.  Come on, Tom.  One more.  One more.  One more.  One more.  One more.  One more.  Over the Rainbow. 
[03:37:30]  That's for that one.  Yeah.  Over the Rainbow.  Over the Rainbow?  Yeah.  I forget the chords.  I mean, it's simple.  I do, but I forget.  We have to send you back to school.

Bluebirds, bluebirds.  Well, I'm stuck.  Over the Rainbow. 
[03:38:00]  Lost in a lullaby.  All right, Tom, you ready for the break?

Where's the grass at, man?  I'll do Barry Manilow.  All right, Barry Manilow.  Let's go.  Give it your all, because this is your last one.  Come on.  Are you feeling it, Grey Wolf? 
[03:39:00]  You jump in with that blue.  I have some old country.  I have some.  Ah, shit, I've played so long.  Go back to the Rolling Stones.  That's the only one that comes down there and takes care of him.  Ah, shut up.  Shut up.  I'm going to do some Neil Young. 
[03:39:30]  Neil Young?  Neil Young.  Very young.  Neil Young.  I forgot, man.  I've been waiting years.  Plus, I don't even know how to play it right anyway.  Come on, Tom.  Come on, Tom.  People are waiting.  Tippi Tom does not know how to play the guitar.  All right.  Sing something, Tom.  Sing something, Tom. 
[03:40:00]  Maybe the dirt in his finger now is getting in the way of awful.  It's almost good.  Yes.  It's your turn.  Your turn.  I'm taking a break.  All right.  Tippi Tom's taking a break.  Listen, we're moving, Tom.  All right.  Yeah, this is always fun.  We're getting kicked out.  Yeah, you're getting kicked out.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  You dropped something.

This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You could hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one. 
[03:41:00]  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  All right.  Yo.  All right.  Yo.  All right.  Yo.  You played that night.  And now you got nowhere to go.  My money's gone and off to all my friends.  And the cops said to me.  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here. 
[03:41:30]  And he says, you know I have an angel.  And he says, that is you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me.  Shelter me from the falling rain. 
[03:42:00]  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  And it's just a little piece.  This is the end.  What are you talking about?  Of the worst of Opie and Anthony.
