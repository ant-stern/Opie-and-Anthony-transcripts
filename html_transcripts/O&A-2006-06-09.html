<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious discussion of a zero-star review of Jim Norton's HBO show, *Lucky Louie*, by Linda Stassi of the New York Post.  Opie and Anthony unleashed a torrent of vulgarity and threats (including spitting in Stassi's face) while dissecting the review point-by-point, defending the show's humor and characters.  They then transitioned to promoting Norton's upcoming *Lucky Louie* appearance at Tower Records, promising giveaways and a performance by the Black Sabbath tribute band Sabra Cadabra, arranged by listener "No Filter Paul," who was present in the studio.  The hosts interspersed this with jokes about news items, including the death of Al Zarqawi (with graphic descriptions of the newspaper photo) and an 80-year-old college graduate, all delivered with their characteristic offensive and crude humor.  They also discussed past controversies, their relationship with listeners, and the success of their WBCN show in Boston, contrasting it unfavorably with the Hillman Morning Show.  Big A and Twitchels,  along with No Filter Paul,  were in studio, with Twitchels performing comedic movie scenes.

The show continued with a scathing, homophobic and misogynistic parody of a rival Boston radio show's "Man Town" segment, featuring audio clips and further derogatory commentary from the hosts and callers.  This was followed by an off-color anecdote from Anthony about a strip club encounter, and discussion of Julie Kahn, who had prevented their return to a previous station (AF).  Further news segments, covering an elderly Harvard graduate and an elderly woman fighting off a robber, were met with cynical and offensive commentary.  The promotion of Norton's Tower Records appearance, including Sabra Cadabra's performance, concluded this segment.

A significant portion focused on an awkward encounter with Howard Stern Show member Boyd Gary and "Tom Chiasano" in the building lobby, resulting in a tense handshake and Opie's expressed dislike for Gary and the Stern Show.  The hosts speculated about Chiasano's motives. This segued into "Jimmy Day," a listener-organized celebration for Jim Norton, beginning with a walk from the studio to XM radio, interacting with fans wearing Breathe Right strips and holding crude signs.  The hosts then discussed their frustration with angry users on the "Wackbag" online forum before announcing their upcoming XM national television commercial for Father's Day, met with surprise and speculation.  The "Jimmy Day" celebration culminated in a large cake from MafiaLife.com revealing strippers from Centerfoldstrips.com, leading to further raunchy jokes and interactions.

The "Jimmy Day" celebration continued with an extended, graphic depiction of multiple strippers (Natalie, Rio, Janela) from Centerfoldstrips.com engaging in various explicit sexual acts with Jim Norton in the studio, accompanied by detailed, vulgar commentary from the hosts.  Happy Typing Girl and Taz were also present, and a montage of comedic messages for Norton was played. Norton himself briefly appeared to perform an offensive stand-up routine. The hosts repeatedly promoted Centerfoldstrips.com, fullblownaids.com, and MafiaLife.com throughout the segment.

The broadcast concluded with a segment focused on coffee cake muffins from Rivoli's in Tom's River, NJ (781 Fisher Boulevard), involving a humorous struggle over the last muffin with owner Tony Rivoli briefly appearing in-studio.  A "Daily Dump Report" reviewed offensive segments of the show, quoting instances of vulgar language and discussing FCC regulations.  The hosts then mocked "The Wise Guys Show,"  using offensive language to criticize its stereotypical portrayal of Italian-Americans.  Professional wrestler Taz was interviewed about upcoming ECW matches, and Jim Leiritz's amphetamine use was mentioned, before the show ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No! Right off!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron? 
[00:01:00]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opie and A.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Don't you like to mow my lawn? 
[00:01:30]  Huh?  You're just a tool.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  My machine wasn't turned on.  La machine.  Here it is.  What do you got?  It's Friday's. 
[00:02:00]  Friday's.  It's Friday's.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out today.  You know what I like saying?  T-G-I-F.  It makes everyone laugh and feel good about the day.  Sure.  You know what that stands for, by the way?  Sure you could come up with something that can't be used here because of the Friday word. 
[00:02:30]  Transgendered something?  Yeah, exactly.  And it's sort of Jimmy Day.  It's sort of Jimmy Day.  It's turned into sort of Jimmy Day.  Jesus.  The faithful listeners understand, but maybe for the casual listeners, we've been trying  to get this Jimmy Day together because Jimmy's going to be at Tower Records tonight, 6 p.m.  Yep.  Broadway and 66th Street.  We're all going to be down there.  Anthony and I will definitely be there. 
[00:03:00]  Most of the crew from the Opie and Anthony show will be there.  It's pretty much our first appearance since going back to commercial radio, so we're expecting  a pretty nice crowd.  We'll have lots of stuff to give away, including Jimmy's HBO comedy special that he did.  He's going to be signing copies of that, about two to 250 of those.  Then he's got the Lucky Louie premiere episode or what have you from HBO that he's going to  be signing.  Yeah, Linda Stassi is going to be handing them out on her hands and knees with an apple in  her mouth, like the pig that she is.  She's going to hand them out.  Bad review, was it? 
[00:03:30]  It wasn't bad.  It was actually kind of what I expected.  Let me tell you something.  If you haven't been following, Jim Norton is part of Lucky Louie that's debuting on HBO  this Sunday at 1030, right after Entourage.  A great spot.  Fantastic spot.  For a brand new show.  And we've been reading the reviews off and on this week, and most of them have been good  reviews.  Yes.  Yeah.  And killed in the San Francisco Chronicle, I heard.  Yeah.  Douchebag we talked to yesterday, who a lot of the listeners didn't care for the way I handled  it, die, die, die.  Him and the Newark star, Ledger, her. 
[00:04:00]  There's going to be some that hate us, but this one I think.  Of course.  Can I tell you something?  If Linda Stassi likes Lucky Louie, then you're in deep trouble.  Linda Stassi.  There are people you don't want to like your project.  I'm telling you right now.  Because if Linda Stassi's sitting there laughing with the girls as she watches Lucky Louie,  you guys are in deep trouble.  She's a soccer mom, and she's a pig, and I never liked her.  Well, she said some crappy things about us when we got fired.  Oh, yeah.  And I swear, and I said this, and lawyers told me to shut the hell up.  But when I do see her, because it does happen, eventually you do see these people live, you 
[00:04:30]  know, I will spit in her face.  Ooh.  No problem.  And then they debated if that's a crime and this and that, blah, blah.  I don't give a crap.  If I see Linda Stassi for the crap she said personally about my parents, I will spit in  her stupid face.  Do you think she'll take two fingers, wipe it off, and go, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  I would have no problem punching her in the face, but that would obviously be a real deal  and a real problem.  That's assault.  You can still fantasize about it. 
[00:05:00]  No, but I will definitely spit in her face.  And I'll make sure I eat it like a candy bar or something, just get it all, uh.  Chocolate milk.  Chocolate milk.  Gets it all clammy.  You know, get my mouth working where, you know, you can do that saliva spit that goes  all the way down the floor and then suck it up.  Suck it back up.  That's the kind of spit that's going to land on her face when I finally run into that bitch.  Mm.  Oh, she's all brave.  These people, you know, hiding behind their columns and stuff.  Yeah.  I'm thinking they're going to be cute and talk about how my parents, uh, must be awful 
[00:05:30]  people, uh, to raise someone like me and someone like Anthony.  That's right.  Our parents had nothing to do with our Sex for Sam thing.  My parents were awful people, but that's none of her business.  That's right.  Damn it.  Our parents have nothing to do what we choose to do on the radio.  Yes.  You pig.  So today in the New York Post, um, she gives Lucky Louie no stars.  That's better than four.  No stars for Lucky Louie. 
[00:06:00]  None of those pesky stars getting in the way of the review.  No stars.  Stars are distracting.  No stars.  This was one I saw coming.  I even said to Louie, we talked to them like, uh.  You know what program gets no stars?  A program that's a half hour long that is just a blank black screen.  Right.  That should get no stars.  No stars.  Because it didn't even start to do anything.  It should at least get one star that the actors showed up.  Exactly.  Yeah, you've got to acknowledge at least they threw something on TV.  Yeah.  Zero stars means that your cable went out while you were trying to review the thing. 
[00:06:30]  You know what I'm having?  Zero stars.  Zero stars.  Self-centered ass I am.  I'm so happy that even through the bad reviews, I mean, so far, nobody has bad mouthy acting.  That's all I was worried about.  Yeah.  I was going to say, the show is okay, except for Jim Norton, his weak, novice acting.  Oh, no.  I watched it last night.  Now, I hadn't watched it through all these reviews and everything, so I popped in the  disc last night.  And, geez, perish the thought HBO sent over a copy without the ghost of HBO over the whole 
[00:07:00]  thing.  So it looked like, in certain scenes, people had sunburn on their cheek in the shape of  a D from the middle of the O.  That wasn't meant for us.  That was just meant to be given out of comedy clubs for fans.  What about me, Jimmy?  I agree.  What about, I gave it zero stars because of the HBO logo in front.  That's actually the final copy.  They have that.  I watched it.  I thought it was very funny.  And that, what, with the girl, the little girl's adorable.  And then her saying, why?  Why? 
[00:07:30]  At the beginning?  That guy didn't get that scene.  Do you see what I'm saying?  How he viewed it backwards.  And it wasn't just, if she had asked why about the questions that a child has and the father's  just answering each one legitimately and logically, it would be boring.  It would be a boring scene.  But that built because it got so awkward because he's now answering these philosophical questions  that he's been asking himself.  It's his inner dialogue now saying why and him answering himself. 
[00:08:00]  The kid is there as a prop at that moment.  He didn't get that.  No.  That part of the joke.  Right.  The black guy is very funny.  He's very good.  Yeah, he's great.  And I'm just going to call him the black guy.  That's all we call him on the show.  But he's very good.  Hey, Tolkien, it's time for a scene.  He's very good.  And the whole dynamic there, the way Louie, for some guilt-ridden reason, is trying to  get him as his friend is very funny. 
[00:08:30]  I like that.  It's silly.  And he's not a typical black guy on TV.  He's deadpan.  He's not shucking jive.  And, you know, it's just.  Yeah.  And they give him the chance to be friends again.  And he comes over and the dinner's on the table already over.  And they're just standing at the door disgusted.  Yeah.  How many stars?  Me?  Yeah.  First episode, the only one I saw, three stars.  Three stars, man.  And I know that's one of the, this is a show that has what they call legs.  Like, I could see the character building. 
[00:09:00]  First show of anything.  Watch the first Seinfeld.  The characters aren't developed yet.  The first Seinfeld is awful.  It's awful.  The characters aren't like they ended up being after even a few weeks in.  They started really feeling who they were and getting a grasp of the character.  And I'm sure that that happens in any sitcom.  You realize what your character is and make more of it.  And our own little Jimmy Norton only has one scene in the first episode.  But as the series goes, I hear you get a lot more scenes. 
[00:09:30]  And you're just scary and creepy.  Did you see he's like unshaven?  He's unshaven.  All the way down to his Adam's apple.  I didn't know you could grow like facial hair like that.  He's all like belligerent.  Yeah.  Like, your facial hair is weird because you have none where you're supposed to have it,  like way up here.  It starts on your lower jaw and then continues all the way down to your Adam's apple.  He's got like 1,800 politician hair.  Right.  If it grew in.  If it grew in.  Right.  I look almost like Alzar Cowie on the top of these magazines. 
[00:10:00]  By the way, yeah, we're going to be all over the ball field.  We'll talk about Alzar Cowie on the front page of all the New York papers.  Here's Linda Stassi.  I never forgot this.  Good riddance.  One more thing, though.  Yeah.  When the show, when it ended, the first episode, it did leave me wanting more.  Like, I was like, we get one episode?  I should have the whole catalog.  The critics got four episodes.  And this is what bugged me about certain things that were said,  which I can't say what plot lines are.  You're just not allowed to.  Except for the pilot. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Certain things like, yeah, typical sitcom.  It's like, dude, if you wait till this one and that one,  certain things are addressed very differently.  That's what kind of irritated me.  Right, right.  I think that's a good show.  All right, listen.  My wife's got a hot little body on her there.  Pam, yeah.  She's Bobby on King of the Hill.  Yes, she is.  Good riddance to Radio Cancer is backing up a little bit.  This is from August 25th, 2002.  Oh, yes, I hold a grudge.  Oh, yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Linda Stacey, Stassi, whatever.  The Catholic Church, which has been rocked by Linda Alzar Cowie, 
[00:11:00]  by more sex scandals than Bill Clinton.  Well, almost.  Then she has to write in parentheses.  Well, almost.  She's funny.  The Catholic Church, which has been rocked by more sex scandals than Bill Clinton,  well, almost, managed to take the heat off themselves last week  by finally getting a couple of perverts fired.  That's funny.  No, not priest.  That's why God invented rehab, medication, and meditation.  Let me say something.  She makes jokes about actual abuses of pedophilia going on in the church. 
[00:11:30]  This is what we brought up yesterday, how the stupid news people won't comment on some of  the horrific real news, you know, real things out there, but they have no problem commenting  on some dopey thing we do on the radio.  A double joke.  One about that.  Another one about a president of the United States using the Oval Office as his little  sex den.  Yet we are the scumbags in this whole story that she writes.  Linda Stassi is fat-faced and kind of ugly, and she has almost a mullet, and it annoys 
[00:12:00]  me.  I don't like her almost mullet.  But now you're making her sound hot.  Just a little bit hand in her face.  The Firing Fuhrer concerned rabid radio retards Opie Anthony.  Fuhrer.  The Firing Fuhrer.  What?  She's just...  Sorry, I had to give this a word when you say that.  Oh, okay.  The Firing Fuhrer concerned rabid radio retards Opie Anthony.  Two of the most mean-spirited women haters ever on the air.  Oh.  I'm all for free speech, pal.  Ooh.  That's what she writes.  We're not mean-spirited women haters. 
[00:12:30]  We're fun women haters.  That's right.  We don't hate women.  We hit them and they go, come on, we're kidding.  Listen, I'm all for free speech, pal.  That's how I make a living.  Here they are.  When they're all for free speech and they say it, they're not.  There's a problem.  There's an asterisk coming.  Right.  But you lose me when you think breast cancer is funny.  We didn't say funny.  We said hot.  But that's not why they were given the boot.  No.  It took a radio stunt that went as sour as one of their jokes to do the deed. 
[00:13:00]  What?  It took a radio stunt that went as sour as one of their jokes.  Oh, as sour as one of our jokes.  Oh, like our jokes all go sour.  They all go sour.  Every once in a while.  I tell you, refrigerate the jokes, E-Rock.  She's a gal that doesn't take any gunk, though.  I say pasteurize our jokes.  They're going sour.  They should be salted.  Can't we get some Parmalat jokes?  They last in the cabinet.  Christ.  The two geniuses offered points to any equally dopey, nearly as unattractive half-wits willing 
[00:13:30]  to have sex inside St. Pat's.  Cunts is what?  Nearly as unattractive.  Hey, I'm very attractive.  I think I'm going to get the first dump today.  I'll see you.  I actually forgot where we were.  The second one on principle.  It's nice to stop that after the S is already out.  I completely forgot where we were.  Way to go, Anthony.  The two geniuses offered points to any equally dopey, nearly as unattractive half-wits willing  to have sex inside St. Pat's.  Hey, I'm warning you.  A couple out-of-towners stepped in and dropped them before the cops showed up and cuffed them, 
[00:14:00]  which, given the circumstances, was probably a thrill.  Yeah, because they were handcuffed as they were.  Oh, that they probably dug it like, instead of it being bad, it was kind of like a sexual  thing, possibly.  She is a laugh riot.  Let me tell you something.  A lot of people don't think that kind of like fat middle-aged women are funny writers,  but this one is good.  She's a douche.  That's why she has a job in the paper. 
[00:14:30]  Let's see.  All right.  Why it took a stunt in a church to get these guys yanked off the air is what's so puzzling,  really.  Does it have to involve religion for people to get outraged?  Their station, N.E.W., should have pulled their sorry butts off the air when they had a  celebration after a woman who had criticized them, got breast cancer, and had to have a  radical mastectomy?  Did that happen?  I don't remember.  I don't remember that either.  You jackass.  Why were they allowed to make jokes about how great it would be to have her pose topless 
[00:15:00]  with her missing breast?  I was sickened.  I didn't say that.  A quick question.  I would love to know what she's talking about.  Quick question.  I know we're going to...  And I guarantee we could defend it.  But why should that be okay?  I don't know, pig.  Why should it be okay for the paper you worked for to have a picture of Alzar Kowdy's dead  face, which they should have on the front, with a little cartoon circle saying warm up  the virgins on it?  Tee hee.  Tee hee hee.  Tee hee hee. 
[00:15:30]  Why should that be okay?  Ugh.  And then downplaying the story of the New York Post.  Gotcha.  It's Alzar Kowdy dead.  Dead as a doorknob.  This is okay for the kids to see, by the way.  But God forbid you try to have adult talk on a radio show.  I don't mind the face.  It's the warm up the virgins.  It's in like a cartoon circle.  I think this should, I certainly think this should be on the front page of every paper  in America, of course.  But we're so hypocritical.  God forbid there's a breast in the paper. 
[00:16:00]  God forbid we have an adult conversation on the radio.  Then it's like, whoa, hey, we got to protect the children.  A lot more disturbing.  But then right after, right below the dead picture, how America, oh wait, it's actually  the other one.  Sorry, it's the Daily News.  Four stars, car zooms into Fast Lane.  Talking about the cartoon, cars.  Well, this is what we were talking about yesterday, how they can't help themselves. 
[00:16:30]  Their headline is smoke.  It's one of the sickest dead guy pictures in recent memory on the front page of all the  New York papers.  And the Daily News, right under the dead guy, four stars, car zooms into Fast Lane.  It says smoked.  Warplanes take out al-Qaeda's top terrorists in Iraq.  Bush could be turning point.  Coverage begins on page two and three.  Car zooms into Fast Lane.  Four stars.  It looks like he got run over by a car.  You know who I think haters, too, is the broad from Newsday. 
[00:17:00]  They shouldn't allow broads.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't be allowed to do what you do.  Look, you cook.  You reproduce.  Godspeed.  You should not be reviewing comedy.  That's not what broads do.  Yeah, keep the broads to, like, the advice columns, things like that.  How about hints from Heloise?  Make sure the Sudoku is all organized nice on one page.  Absolutely.  Steven wants to know, at any point in her article, does she say, and I like to laugh as much as the next gal? 
[00:17:30]  Steve from Bayshore tearing it up.  All right.  She does if the next gal is Hedda Nushbaum.  So getting back to this article, which is obviously very old, but I never forgot.  And now with her doing a zero-star review on Lucky Louie, we figured we'd bring this up today.  Let's be honest.  That really says something.  When someone gives me zero stars, there's, like, a little bit more going on than just not enjoying.  I've not enjoyed programs, but I've never not enjoyed a program like zero.  Zero.  Zero.  Silly goose.  Zero.  I've sat through zeros that I thought were, like, zeros, but at least I sat through them and watched it. 
[00:18:00]  They're not zero.  They're not zero stars.  It has to be a half a star at best.  A blank screen, like you said, a blank screen is zero stars.  But then again, maybe people would enjoy that.  They would meditate, too, and go, that was some terrific meditation, and I'm going to give it three stars.  Relaxing.  All right.  The next time I tuned into the show, so she gave us two shots, I guess, back in the day.  The second and last time I tuned in, which I had to do for my day job.  Wow.  She doesn't have to listen to the show for her day job. 
[00:18:30]  Her boss said, put on the Opie and Anthony show, but I don't want to.  You're at work, miss.  They were asking moms to call in and tell them what disgusting things they do to score a couple of Britney Spears tickets for their kids.  We did do that.  We used to play a game, and we'll do it again.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  Yeah, absolutely we did that.  I don't think we'll be playing the exact game.  It'll be for something else.  Sure.  Right.  We'll do it.  Yeah.  Who wants to see a fat, you know, Britney Spears?  Pregnant.  Pregnant mess.  Who wants to see Britney Spears sing the same songs with a lasagna belly? 
[00:19:00]  The only thing that made it good was her body.  Right.  She did these elaborate stage shows where she would faux taking a bath in some skin-colored tight body suit.  It was great.  Then she flings herself on a bed while some gay black dancer makes like he's having sex with her.  That's fine.  I could care less if she could sing or not.  And now, looks like a rising dough coming out of the top of her pants. 
[00:19:30]  This doesn't sound good in writing, but it makes me laugh still to this day.  One woman volunteered to have sex with her daughter in front of them.  One woman volunteered to have sex.  And then she writes, they thought that was just great.  Of course we did.  Who wouldn't?  Every man in America thinks that would be great to see.  Including the father and husband in that family.  How do you not enjoy that, you goose?  They were all of age, by the way.  Yes.  Oh, by the way, she continues, I don't know what happened because by then I was projectile vomiting. 
[00:20:00]  Nuh-uh, were ya?  And forgot to bring a radio into the bathroom with me.  You probably didn't forget to bring cake, though, did you, fat face?  A little binging and purging going on there?  Projectile vomiting would be good for you.  Then she writes, fired.  They should all have been arrested.  Ooh.  Wow.  Baba!  Ta-da!  You have that?  Yeah.  Hold on.  We should be, that needs a little drama to it all.  Yeah.  That was a statement.  All right. 
[00:20:30]  You're absolutely right.  Linda, David Cassidy-Hare from 1976 made a statement.  And I want it to be addressed properly.  All right.  Oh, they made fun of my appearance.  Uh, which one?  What was the line?  The arrested line.  Oh, uh, fired?  They should all have been arrested.  Oh, this bitch stinks.  She's a hack. 
[00:21:00]  Excuse me.  Who'd want morons like that for listeners anyway?  Oh, yes.  W-O-N-A-W.  That's who.  And, of course, that squeaky voice guy from the Sam Adams beer commercials who happens to  be the brewery owner.  Didn't you know?  Didn't you know?  Why don't you shut up, you whore?  The contest was called Sex for Sam 3, the prize a trip to the Sam Adams Brewery, O&A's major  sponsor.  Instead, the copulating couple may get a trip to beautiful Rikers Island, all expenses paid. 
[00:21:30]  Wow.  Ooh.  She's great.  Ooh.  I like how she's writing gritty and pretty.  Yeah.  This is, like, noir.  Yeah.  This is, she's got, like, a writing style.  What's that guy's name?  Raymond Chandler?  That's a good one.  She should have, like, a fedora.  Yeah.  She's Sam Slade.  She tells it like it is, honey.  Who's the guy who used to do the light beer commercials?  And he had, like, this.  Mickey Spillane.  Mickey Spillane. 
[00:22:00]  That's who she is.  And she looks like him.  I can't believe I actually knew something today.  Mickey Spillane.  So, she's at it again.  Lucky Louie.  Rikers Island, all expenses paid.  Whore.  Oh, she really is.  So, Lucky Louie.  Louie, out of luck.  No stars.  We'll do the review next.  All right.  All right.  It's kind of Jimmy Day today.  It's kind of Jimmy Day.  But I've got to tell you, the Pest, the fans of the Opie and Anthony show took it upon themselves 
[00:22:30]  to make this a very nice day for you, Jimmy.  Yes.  Thank you.  A very nice day.  I'm still calling it kind of Jimmy Day.  I think at the end of the Lucky Louie season, I think we're going to do it upright.  Yes.  Really do it upright.  Which, according to Linda, get ready for next week.  So, but it's kind of Jimmy Day.  I know some of the boys, some of the Pest have planned some things for you.  Oh.  Ben, excuse me.  Ben got a band for you.  They're going to play next a little bit. 
[00:23:00]  Huh?  Sabbath.  Yeah.  Actually, yeah.  Poe thinks Black Sabbath is here.  He actually thinks Black Sabbath is here, right?  Am I lying?  Ben?  Hey.  Am I lying?  Nope.  And he doesn't think the band.  He thinks the Boris Karloff movie.  We actually have Sabra Kadabra here.  Yes.  I'm really excited.  The greatest Black Sabbath tribute band.  So, they're going to play a few songs in and out of breaks for us today for Kind of  Jimmy Day.  Kind of Jimmy Day.  Ben hysterical laughing.  Kind of Jimmy Day.  So, Black Sabbath's here. 
[00:23:30]  And one of the message boards that we're not allowed to mention here for some reason,  they changed their entire board to reflect Kind of Jimmy Day.  I know.  I was a little annoyed with some of them, and I went on to post something at the end,  and I went on, and it was all yellow in honor of me.  I was like, oh.  Oh, yeah.  Yellow.  You know what?  I didn't even get the yellow until just now.  What an ass I am.  What a day we had yesterday, me and Jimmy and the board.  Yeah, we'll get into that as well.  Oof.  A couple of men.  But don't forget, later today, 6 p.m., Tower Records, 66th Street, and Broadway,  we'll be there hanging out with Jim Norton, the whole crew. 
[00:24:00]  Yep.  Should be a good time.  If you're in the New York area, please stop by and say hi.  It's our first appearance that's coming back to commercial radio.  Might not even rain today.  So, it's kind of exciting.  God likes Jimmy Day.  It's the one virus spreading across America.  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know. 
[00:24:30]  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yep.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not exactly.  I want Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva. 
[00:25:00]  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O&A, Uncut and Live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, now there's an 80-year-old graduate. 
[00:25:30]  Octogenarian.  Oh, man.  Well, who remembers the 70-year-old graduate?  Now we got an 80-year-old broad that just graduated college.  Is that a broad?  It's so old, you can't tell gender anymore.  Yeah, it just turns into a thing.  Yeah, if you're still having sex with your wife at 80, you're officially gay.  You know who she looks like?  Do you remember the old guy from The Longest Yard?  He said, was it worth it?  When you hit the ward, he goes, yeah, it was. 
[00:26:00]  That's who she looks like.  Can we get the audio of the 80-year-old graduate from college?  It's a terrific story.  It's a feel-good story today.  Feel good.  I've got to tell you.  Here's the great thing that no one can see.  When Ope does a line like that, he's got his little fist clashed, and he's kind of doing  it like in a joyous...  Because he's happy about it.  Nobody can see that.  That makes me happy.  Joyous.  I'm in a mood today.  I'm wide awake.  Yesterday, I felt like crap.  I didn't, you know what, for like two or three days. 
[00:26:30]  I was starting to look like, you know, maybe a baby that Angelina Jolie should adopt.  A little bloated.  Oh my God, was I bloated.  And then I go home yesterday, right?  My brother's in town for a few days, Elmo.  Brother Elmo on MySpace.  Jesus.  He loves the MySpace.  Who doesn't?  And he's been staying with me here in New York for the last two or three days, and I got  home from our TV meeting.  Oh, yeah.  And he was out cold on the couch, so I went into the bathroom. 
[00:27:00]  There's no fan in my bathroom.  Why would there be?  And proceeded to finally have my first, can I say movement?  You could say that.  All right.  The first one in like two or three days.  Wow.  And I thought I was getting away with murder in there, and good old Elmo heard the whole  thing from the couch.  I heard you drop anchor big time, man.  Drop anchor.  Let's just put it this way.  It sounded like I was puking.  God. 
[00:27:30]  You know, there are other ways to camouflage the sound.  You got to sink, don't you?  Turn the water on loud.  Oh, it sounded like the water was on loud.  Oh, it did anyway?  It sounded like I was filling up a bathtub.  But I feel much better because now I'm back to all cleaned out.  It was just the worst.  So, Linda Stassi, no stars for Lucky Louie.  But I say this is a good thing for Jim Norton and Louis C.K. and the rest of the gang as 
[00:28:00]  the show debuts Sunday night on HBO after Entourage, 1030.  Because if this broad likes your show, then you're in deep trouble creatively.  I told you in the break, I will take no stars over one or one and a half stars.  That's just like, ugh.  But no stars, she's obviously got like a, you know, a problem with it.  A bird from Philly wants to know if the 80-year-old college grad has pictures of Uncle  Junior up on her dorm walls.  What kind of job is she going to get?  And what is she proving? 
[00:28:30]  Nothing.  Just read a few books at home.  Stop.  What does she major in?  Diaper cleaning?  Me, me, me.  Exactly.  It's all about me, me, me.  Look at me.  Anyway.  You want to read this Lucky Louie?  It's very short.  Review, Jimmy?  Yes.  And this one, by the way, she annoys me less than that guy yesterday.  Really?  She really does, yeah.  Because it's what you expect from a kind of like a, you know, a soccer mom broad.  What if you took the Honeymooners and placed it in 2006?  Would it end up as ugly and slimy as Lucky Louie? 
[00:29:00]  HBO's misguided answer to the comedy void left by Sex and the City.  Another Sex and the City.  The comedy void.  That show was a comedy void, you dumb broads.  Broads, that show stunk.  If the answer is yes, then the bigger question should be, how did we sink to this level?  How?  I don't know.  Maybe because you're fat, Linda, and the floor caved in.  Hey, we need some dinners.  Well, yeah.  I got the dinners. 
[00:29:30]  Jimmy should get the dinners.  I would like, I will read that one again because that does deserve, hold on.  If the answer is yes, then the bigger question is, how did we sink to this level?  The show opens with Lou, a low-paid muffler installer, talking to his unpleasant preschool daughter.  Unpleasant?  The girl's adorable.  She's as cute as a button.  She is mean, though, which I like.  Is she mean?  Yeah, and that's the beauty of what she does.  Of course, a fat lady doesn't like the fact that the kid is mean and adorable, but at times unlikable because she's just awful. 
[00:30:00]  You know what I found hysterical, too?  That Louie pays no attention to what she's saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's hysterical.  Like, he's walking her home from school or something.  She's got a little backpack on.  She's talking about her day nonstop and won't shut up.  And Louie's not paying attention to anything she's saying.  Just opens the door to their apartment and kind of shoves her in there.  Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.  Yeah, okay.  Well, that's honesty.  Most parents don't listen to their kids babble.  Of course not.  They really don't. 
[00:30:30]  Who are you kidding?  Drivel.  Oh, she goes, uh, and you get the impression that it's a boring Roseanne.  You should be so lucky.  Instead, it's a darkly depressing and, uh-oh, out come the quotes.  Mm-hmm.  Comedy, end quote.  Oh, see, it's not really a comedy.  It's a, um, comedy.  About what Louie C.K. thinks is close to real life fun.  Honey, if that's your reality, check me out now.  Fat pig. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  Why is she allowed to still write?  I mean, come on.  She writes, like, Mae West talks.  Yeah.  She's an old...  This is hack writing.  Honey, if that's your idea.  If you handed this in in a writing class in college, they would laugh at you and say,  change majors.  Yeah, you stink.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  She really takes you to task.  Louie and wife Kim live in a depressing Honeymooners-era apartment with, yes, a dingy brown kitchen.  I mean, really, who paints their kitchen brown? 
[00:31:30]  She didn't like the color scheme of the kitchen.  Or the fact...  Oh, what a broad.  Does that not show you what a woman this is?  I pray there is not a Mr. Stassi.  I pray that this woman is single because that husband, the hell, he must have to go through  on a daily basis dealing with the likes of her.  If there is, what he's doing right now, he's got it tucked back like James Gumb and he's  rearranging the guest bath soaps so she doesn't get upset when she comes home. 
[00:32:00]  Refilling the potpourri and getting paints for the kitchen because it's getting a little dingy.  Who notices?  It's supposed to be a dingy set.  Right.  But the fact that that would bother you, you fat friends lover, that's who paints it.  Yeah, the friend's apartment was fun.  It had little chutzkies on around and knick-knack and brick-a-brick-a-brack.  Fall on some sharp brick-a-brack in your house. 
[00:32:30]  I hate brick-a-brack.  Brick-a-brack stinks.  Brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-brick-a-br 
[00:33:00]  That's why I'll rephrase.  You know what?  I'll rephrase.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, start over.  When Kim wants another baby, she tries to force Louie to have sex.  But Louie prefers to, let's just say, do it with himself, to a magazine layout of Jessica Simpson.  And then she writes, ew.  You know what's amazing about what you just did?  This is in a paper.  Yes, I know.  But we're not allowed to read it word for word on a radio show. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  That's so stupid.  It makes no sense.  Because the fact that she would go, ew, after someone does that to a layout of Jessica Simpson.  Ew.  That should show you what you need to know.  Here's the last paragraph.  There's a lot of nasty looking sex between Kim and Louie.  What?  Yeah, like in a couple of the episodes, they show them having sex.  It's not pretty.  Oh, she saw four episodes.  Yeah, of course.  And even a full frontal nude shot of Louie running out of bed.  Okay, now I'm offended.  Not a pretty sight.  And that's the end of her review.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:34:00]  That's.  They're doing a whole montage on CNN.  Of dead guy photos.  It's called dead guy photos.  I guess they have action figures that their head spins around and it goes from the guy alive to the guy dead.  Right.  They're showing dead guy photos from the years.  Dead guy photos.  Dead guy photos.  And it's okay to show dead people on TV now.  It's okay to show dead people on the front page of your newspaper. 
[00:34:30]  But God forbid you have an old conversation on a radio show.  Mussolini.  This is going to be a good one.  They really caved his head in.  The hanging upside down picture.  Was that done in the spirit of the gun?  That's him.  His wife.  Look at his chest.  Was blown out.  And, of course, Adolf.  Sit down.  They never got him.  Never got him.  Never took him.  He was like LaMotta talking to the coalition forces. 
[00:35:00]  You never knocked me down.  You never knocked me down.  I like that.  They put a little rouge on his cheeks.  On Alzar Kawi's cheeks.  He has rosacea.  That's right.  And, of course.  By the way, I stole Anthony's observation.  Was it Anthony's observation about the framed picture?  Yeah.  I was pondering that all night.  It was a group effort there.  It was.  Yes, it was.  I brought to the attention, and then you hit it out of the park.  All right.  I want to review the tape because I know I came up with a framed reference.  Well, then the whole. 
[00:35:30]  I said it was.  It's on tape.  We're going to fight.  Well, then the whole group bombed.  I tried it at the cellar, and I gave credit to you guys.  Did it bomb?  Did it bomb?  Yeah.  There was actually a dead militant leader on the stage after the joke.  What was the joke he came up with?  We just thought it was funny that someone had to go out.  Blame it on me.  And figure out the frame that they needed to use for the dead guy photo.  Well, I said.  That was someone's job yesterday.  I said that I gave credit.  I can't steal the joke.  It was like one day. 
[00:36:00]  It's good for me.  Sorry.  I hate this.  Channel 2 news here.  We need audio of the old woman that beat up somebody with her umbrella, a potential robber  or rapist or something, with her walker umbrella.  This woman is demonstrating for people how she beat up an attacker with her umbrella.  And I've got to hear this old bag.  I wouldn't mind it as much if they brought on successful attackers, and they showed you  how they beat the old person with a brick.  For legal time.  Exactly how did you crack the potted plant over that skull?  But anyway, the joke about the framed picture of... 
[00:36:30]  I tried it.  I said, look, my friend pointed this out.  I had to give credit because, again, I can't, you know, whatever.  It was just a fun thing I was wanting to do.  Yeah.  I said that there was a frame around the picture of Al Zarqawi.  They actually had to go out and get a frame.  And the setup would have...  I figured we'd get a chuckle as I built.  It got such a non-reaction.  I'm like, somebody must have just said these exact words.  And I'm like, but then they had to mat it.  I'm like, did somebody have to pick out things that would bring out, like, features on his...  I was just like, uh, uh. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, Jesus.  It got, it got this.  Do they pay attention down there?  I think they do.  I think they do.  And I took folk, they were good friends.  You know what?  It's more just an observation as a ha-ha funny thing.  Yeah.  That they brought it out.  Because you would think all they would need is a poster board picture of Al Zarqawi on  an easel for the press to take pictures of.  Here's the dead guy.  Look, we prove it. 
[00:37:30]  He's dead.  Why did somebody in some department somewhere decide that they had to go out and get a frame  and have it matted with three-inch white matting around the photo?  And someone had to make a conscious decision as to what frame was appropriate.  You don't want to go with chrome because it's too modern and happy.  You don't want something gaudy with a lot of gold because it almost makes the guy look special.  It's a simple, plain, wooden, Jesus Christ would have made it frame that they put it in. 
[00:38:00]  But a conscious decision was made.  And I found that odd.  With a mat.  With the white matting around it for some reason.  And I'll tell you why the boke, the joke bombed.  Why?  And I said boke.  That's all right.  The boke jumped.  I bet you most people in the audience last night at the cellar didn't see the shot.  Didn't even see the boke.  Maybe not.  People are stupid.  I explained it to the fact, but even if they didn't see the shot, even if they didn't  know that he was dead, it should have gotten some kind of a response that a human being  had just spoken to them. 
[00:38:30]  He's dead.  His health won't allow it.  All right.  It got...  I could have easily just stood up there and said, you know, I ordered some ice, right?  And it was a little bit melted.  And that would have gotten a bigger laugh than that frame.  I tried to explain it and I actually just started going like...  Did he get dry mouthed?  As I was saying it, I realized it was 180 people.  Someone will figure it out.  Completely disinterested in what I was saying.  Someone's going to figure it out and knock that one out of the park.  Ben, bring in the band. 
[00:39:00]  Ooh!  We don't have enough confidence in today, so we're calling it Kind of Jimmy Day.  Kind of Jimmy Day.  We wanted a full-blown Jimmy Day.  And the listeners are...  It's amazing.  We have a really weird relationship with the listeners of the show.  Yes.  They are.  They just take it upon themselves.  Love some of them.  And hate some of them.  Yeah.  To do stuff like this.  Little gentleman.  Hi, sweetie.  There they are.  Wow.  We're talking Sabra Cadabra in studio for Kind of Jimmy Day. 
[00:39:30]  Kind of Jimmy Day.  My favorite Sabbath cover band.  I love these guys because they play like that hardcore.  Saddle stuff, man.  Yeah.  Can we talk to the band?  How do we talk to the guys?  I don't know.  Ben, should we talk to them through these mics?  What do you want to do?  No, I know where to pot it up on the board.  They can just talk through the mics they're using?  All right.  And no filter Paul is here?  Bill from Waterford says,  Jimmy, to make the LZARCOWIE picture joke funny.  You should have said,  Well, the people who made this decision on crack. 
[00:40:00]  It was like a picture frame from hell.  No filter Paul is in studio.  Oh, one of the great ONA listeners.  No filter Paul.  Don't want to blow up your spot.  No.  But you know what I'm talking about.  I'll just say it doesn't work in my DVD player.  Oh, no.  That's taken care of.  Oh, no.  It's already taken care of.  Thank you.  Why don't you talk into a mic?  He's just talking to a mic.  Why would you talk into a mic?  But the funny thing is there's a mic over Paul,  and he's just like staring like it's above his head, 
[00:40:30]  and he's just not acknowledging it.  I don't do it like that in Britain.  Go ahead.  Hi, Dumply.  Hey, sweetie.  Paul's up.  So what do you got here, Paul?  We've got to make it quick.  It's a fast-paced version of the opening of the show  on this side of the fence.  We heard that Jimmy Day had fell apart,  and we thought we'd do something for it.  And Denise and I thought it would be great to get a hold of it.  Wait, wait.  You what?  Thought.  Thought.  Thought.  I fought.  Okay, anyway. 
[00:41:00]  We love Jimmy.  We work for Jimmy.  He's a great guy.  He's a really cool guy,  and we want to do this.  He's all right.  Let's calm down.  I'm sweet.  Well, when they do Opie Day,  we'll help you out, too.  There will never be an Opie Day.  There's Opie Day.  There'll be an Opie Day  when there's a framed picture of you  on the news somewhere.  All right.  I was like, how are you?  Then people will realize how nice I really was.  Make a stamp out of you.  All right.  So you did a bunch of things  for sort of Jimmy Day, right?  Yeah, we did. 
[00:41:30]  And you contacted the band?  We called Zabra Kedabra,  and we explained, you know,  the whole thing that fell apart,  and Jimmy was, you know,  this was his favorite group.  Obviously, we can't get the real black Sabbath as easily.  So, yeah.  Well, you're English.  Well, I work.  Couldn't swing that?  You don't know him?  I thought everyone knew everybody over there.  I don't want to blow up anything else  that might happen today, so.  Oh.  There's other things planned?  There's a possibility of something.  I don't want to...  I don't want to...  I honestly have no idea what the Pests have planned today.  Your wife going into the bathroom with a black guy?  That would make Jimmy very happy. 
[00:42:00]  It would officially be Jimmy Day.  No, we honestly don't know,  but the ONA Pests have taken it upon themselves  to make this a much better day for you, Jimmy.  It was supposed to be Jimmy Day today,  and I've got to be honest,  the people behind the scenes failed miserably.  It just fell apart.  And then the ONA Pests took it upon themselves  to try to salvage today for you.  Yes.  And don't forget, later today,  it's Jim Norton, Anthony, and I,  and the whole show,  and ONA Pests,  and everybody,  we're going to be at Tower Records  at 66th Street and Broadway,  starting at 6 p.m., 
[00:42:30]  with lots of stuff to sign and give away.  I'll be giving away, actually,  like 200 copies of the HBO One Night Stand.  XM very generously bought those  just to give to the listeners,  which was really great.  So the first 200 people get them for free,  and I signed them.  Sabra Kadabra.  What's up, guys?  What's going on, man?  Mic's working?  Yeah, they're...  It's working.  Oh, yeah, they got some volume cranking up there.  You guys got a website  people can check you out at and all that?  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  www.sabrakadabra.com  Only two Ws?  Only two Ws. 
[00:43:00]  It's a worldwide something.  TP one slash kind of a colon.  It's sabrakadabra.com  .co  You guys want to jam a little song for us today?  Hell yeah.  All right, this is for Jimmy.

[00:48:00]  God is calling  And the news of war pigs  Crawling  Taking ass  As if I decide  And  Satan laughs  With French's wings  The racer  guitar solo  Thank you. 
[00:48:30]  Thank you. 
[00:49:00]  Thank you. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you. 
[00:50:00]  Thank you. 
[00:50:30]  Sabracadabra.com.  Yes. 
[00:51:00]  We're sort of Jimmy Day.  Sort of Jimmy Day.  We love you, Jim.  You're the best, bro.  These guys are great.  Wait, say that again, because I turned your mic off.  We love you, Jim.  You're the best, bro.  Thank you, man.  I love you.  These are my favorite Sabbath cover band.  The only ones I would actually go to see is Sabbath.  And you guys got gigs all the time, right?  Where are you playing this weekend?  Wild Spirits in New York City.  I got the address over here somewhere.  All right.  Well, we're going to have you, you know, come back to do another song or two.  So I also hear you do some Zeppelin.  I, you know, I got to hear a little Zeppelin.  Oh, no, no.  He's cringing over there. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  Forget it.  We can stick with the Sabbath and the Aussie that's 7 in the morning.  It's a different singer, man.  Guys named Rob Malone.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I got the wrong info there.  I have no problem here.  More Sabbath and Aussie.  So it's Sabra Cadabra for sort of Jimmy Day.  You guys did great.  We'll have you back in a little while here.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  And now, Reflections on James Norton with Mr. Robert Stack.  I'd sure like to be his girlfriend.  Walking in the park hand in hand.  Wrapping my legs around.  Cuddling in the spoon position. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Bring on the flippin' hand cringler.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out sort of Jimmy Day on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  1-866-313-313 if you have anything for the program, for the show, for the virus,  the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thank you, No Filter Paul, for getting Sabra Cadabra to play today. 
[00:52:30]  Rave reviews, by the way, on the instant feedback for Sabra Cadabra.  I guess it's been brought up that No Filter Paul looks like Man Cow's retarded brother.  Has anyone done a split screen with that yet?  Yeah, yeah.  Plenty.  I've been done.  Oh, really?  I haven't seen that yet.  Yep, yep.  A few websites have run with that one.  Yes, absolutely.  Yeah.  By the way, you know, you've got to point it out, you know, free FM here in New York City  making XM look really stupid.  Sabra Cadabra, we can't even have them play at XM. 
[00:53:00]  No.  Because they still have it built out in our studio over there.  They'd never fit.  They wouldn't fit.  They'd have to be in cubicles, each one of them, sitting at a desk with a computer on it.  And their website is sabracadabra.com with two B's, just in case anyone wants to visit them.  S-A-B-B-R-A, right.  S-A-B-B-R-A.  Cadabra.com, yeah.  C-A-D-A-B-R-A.com.  Something like that.  Thanks, Free FM, for helping out with this. 
[00:53:30]  It's very nice of you.  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  Thank you.  Hey, I got a WCN today in Boston.  Oh, wow.  Yep.  It's our second shot at being on at WBCN.  Third shot in Boston.  Third shot in Boston.  Second time at WBCN.  And they just get the program.  It seems like there's a different attitude at WBCN than the first time we were there.  Yeah.  First time we were there, I got to be honest, it was starting to become a lazy radio station.  You know, they depended on Howard a lot. 
[00:54:00]  And the music and the jocks were getting a little tired.  And I don't know.  You know, people weren't hungry.  Right.  The new staff at WBCN, they're very, very hungry.  And they got attitude.  And they get the program.  And they're driving the show up there in the Boston area.  They're doing sticker stops.  And their production and all that is quite good because they're going right for the jugular of AAF up there.  Yeah.  You know, it's a no fact when Howard left commercial radio, a lot of radio stations benefited. 
[00:54:30]  A lot of stations benefited.  And the station that benefited in Boston, I'm not going to lie to you, our old joint AAF.  Yep.  And they don't deserve it, to be quite honest with you.  So the Hillman is sitting there with some really, really good ratings that he didn't really deserve.  You know, the people needed something to listen to.  So they're like, ah, well, there's another rock station in town.  I guess we'll go there.  I guess we'll go there.  And his ratings went through the roof.  But that's not going to last.  Everyone knows it.  And WBCN is already going after the Hillman's Morning Show and AAF in general. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, they are.  And we couldn't be happier.  Yeah.  Nice.  We got some examples of their production.  I guess the big thing with their show is Mantown.  What?  What?  They have a concept called Mantown.  Ew.  Exactly.  That sounds...  They do it like Mantown calendars and stuff, I guess.  But that sounds a little gay.  It sounds very gay.  Because I guess they're... 
[00:55:30]  I don't know.  Mantown.  Mantown.  Yuck.  In the words of Jimmy, yuck.  Yuck.  I give Mantown no stars.  No stars for Mantown.  I give it one star.  And it's brown.  Jimmy goes cruising through Mantown at night.  Hi, Daddy.  No, I don't.  And I personally have no problem going after Hillman because we got fired from Boston for  the mayor's thing.  Never heard from the guy.  Not once. 
[00:56:00]  Not once.  I think the guy was happy that we got fired because we were becoming the big stars at that  radio station.  I don't think we heard from anybody.  We heard from Ozone.  Yeah, Ozone.  We heard from Cary, who I think still works there.  Yeah, Cary's cool.  We've corresponded.  We've heard from a bunch of the people.  We heard from Kevin Barber, even, that works on the Hillman show.  I like Kevin.  I like Cary.  Cary's all right, I guess.  Cary's very cool.  You know?  And who else over there was pretty nice to us? 
[00:56:30]  A few of the people that are the production guy.  He was cool.  Chuck?  Chuck.  I don't know if he's still there.  I have no idea who still works there.  We kind of moved on with our careers and kind of made a name for ourselves, a huge name  for ourselves, while Hillman just sat and rotted in Worcester for, I think he's up to  17 years of rotting in Worcester.  Is it really 17 years?  Something like that.  Because that's a long time.  And no one really gave a crap about his show until Howard left, and then all of a sudden  he got this giant ratings boost, and he's enjoying that. 
[00:57:00]  But we're hearing that he's very, very nervous that we're back in Boston.  And BCN is just having a lot of fun with it.  So it's Man Town or something like that is one of their big bits.  So listen to some of the production.  I've got to know what Man Town's about.  What is Man Town?  I've got to know what it's about.  Maybe someone can call and tell us what Man Town's all about.  Man Town.  You shouldn't have anything with man in it.  So listen to what BCN's doing.  A couple of their production pieces. 
[00:57:30]  We can't hear the Man Town Morning Show through the static.  But we can smell the fear of a defeat.  The Opium Anthony Show.  Weekday Mornings at 6 in crystal clear HD stereo on the Rock of Boston 104.1 WBCN.  See, for the people around America, the static reference.  Yeah.  They work at a radio station that you can't even hear in Boston.  Hitting them with that signal problem.  And you know something? 
[00:58:00]  No matter how many people over there say that doesn't bother them, it does because it bugged  the living crap out of us.  When we were there.  When we were there, it was just...  BCN would hammer us all the time about, hey, Worcester.  How you doing?  You're not even a real Boston station.  We can't even hear you in Boston.  And we'd be like, yeah, well, you shut up.  We had nothing.  It really was frustrating, man.  We had nothing.  Well, here's a definition of Man Town.  All right.  Man Town. 
[00:58:30]  I better do it with a deeper voice.  Man Town.  Man Town.  Man Town.  For those who may not know what this Man Town thing is all about, or for those who may need  a refresher, Man Town is a guy's last refuge.  That place where he goes to be alone and do manly things.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I don't believe this is actually written.  It couldn't be this long.  It may be the renovated basement, the study, a shack outside, or just a section of the  apartment.  So like in a sitcom or something, it would be the place where the husband goes and all 
[00:59:00]  his buddies come over and they just hang out and drink beers until the wife says it's  time to do something.  In front of that big screen TV.  Right.  Bunch of chips and beers talking about guy things.  I'll see you later over in Man Town.  Me and you will grab a couple.  Who the hell would want to hang out in Man Town?  I want to hang out in Slut Town.  Right.  Whoresville.  Whoresville, USA for us.  You know who I got in Man Town?  Faggots!  Faggot! 
[00:59:30]  Mantown.  Put on your robe, grab your poodle, and head to Man Town.  It's that forced married guy place that they have to go to try to be men again when you've  been castrated by your wife.  Right.  Or girl or whatever it is.  Right, right, right.  Mantown.  Wow.  Uh, the important thing is that every man have one.  Right.  They turn the stools upside down when you sit down at Man Town.  Four friends on the same stool talking and laughing at Man Town. 
[01:00:00]  Just talking and laughing.  Uh, yeah, to back up.  Justing themselves.  To back up.  It may be the renovated basement, the study, a shack outside, or just a section of the apartment.  The important thing is that every man have one.  Right.  A shack outside?  A bunch of your faggoty friends and you in a shack?  Can't even stay in the house?  While you have a house there?  You want to go sit in the shack?  No, faggot.  I don't.  Because your domineering wife told you to go out to the shack if you want to hang out  with your friends.  Why don't you be a man's man and just give your wife the little shack outside? 
[01:00:30]  I'll tell you what Man Town is.  And make your house a palace.  Write a review out in the little, write a review in the shack, you fat pig.  I'll tell you where Man Town is.  The ER of a hospital when your wife comes in with two black eyes.  That's Man Town.  Discuss trading ideas of how to shut her up.  While you're all in the waiting room, yours fell too, huh?  You bet she did.  Nah, mine hit the corner of the door again.  That's Man Town, buddy.  We're a member of the Clumsy Wives Club. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, Man Town.  Stinks, it really does stink.  God, man up and get out of Man Town.  They can't even do this bit right.  Just that forced guy reveling the camaraderie.  The camaraderie is there.  We're all men.  We understand.  Should it be Slut Town or Coorsville or something like that?  Hey, hell, man, I can't be inside with my wife and friends either.  So we have a place.  It's down in the basement. 
[01:01:30]  We paneled it, and I've set up something that looks like a little bar.  And I'm going to call it Man Town.  Hey, that's great.  That's great.  And they probably encourage you to listen.  What?  Do you think they encourage you to listen to the Hillman show in Man Town?  Of course.  You've got to listen.  Go to Man Town so you can hear the man things.  Go down to Man Town.  You know what Man Town should be?  I go to Man Town.  It's a bar where Jodie Foster frequents, and it has a pool table and a pinball machine.  That's Man Town.  That's right.  Now you're talking Man Town.  You don't have to worry about what you're saying. 
[01:02:00]  And we're all he is.  Shut up afterwards.  That's right.  Don't rat each other out.  Well, guys, to move on with the definition, the important thing is that every man have one.  There's nothing like sitting back in your recliner in your Man Town, watching the ball game with your buddies,  and checking out the new Miss Man Town calendar and DVD.  Yeah.  Dude, I am getting the douche chills in my brainstem.  A bunch of guys checking out a man.  Yeah, why would you want to go on the net and just find pornography?  You and five homos sit around and look at the calendar. 
[01:02:30]  Because you can't.  Your wife tells you how long you are allowed on the internet and what sites you can go to  because she forbids you from erasing your history.  Here's what you should do when you're in Man Town.  Now, when your friend goes, okay, it's my turn to look at the Man Town calendar.  Go ahead.  All right.  Thank you.  Here you go.  Your turn to look at the calendar.  Man Town sucks.  Oh, my God.  The Hillman is really a jizz bag. 
[01:03:00]  Dope.  This is all I got, though.  They've been driving this dumb thing into the ground.  Who enjoys Man Town?  Well, Steve from Bayshore does Man Town, where every wall has a glory hole.  This is the dumb stuff they do in radio around America.  And I know they record our show in Boston, so why don't we give them some stuff for a promo, okay?  All right.  Hillman, we're coming to get you. 
[01:03:30]  Ant, were you in Man Town when you had that encounter in the treehouse?  Man Treehouse.  Man Town, where they bring out the gimp.  The listener's on fire.  Man Town, you need an umbrella every day because there's always monster rain.  Bunch of mo's.  Cody from Dallas.  The description of Man Town sounds exactly like any rest stop along a major highway.  Man Town, where Oz is considered hardcore fun pornography. 
[01:04:00]  Pinchy in Cleveland.  Does everyone in Man Town ride bikes with no seats?  And they never fix the potholes on purpose?  Makes that ride a little better, ladies and gentlemen.  Booby Man in Brooklyn.  Isn't Man Town where they fill Brokeback Mountains?  All right.  Well, BCN is having a lot of fun with this because it's such a hack bit.  Everyone knows it's a hack bit.  It's awful.  The Man Town show in Worcester is confused. 
[01:04:30]  Is it tuck and cover or run and hide or both?  The Opie and Anthony show in crystal clear HD stereo on the rock of Boston 104.1 WBCN.  You guys live in Man Town.  We live in Whoresville.  Birch from Philly wants to know if the official publication of Man Town is Honcho Magazine.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:05:00]  Favorite food?  Johnny Cakes.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's going on?  Oh, God damn.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Hill Man show was so bad, I used to listen to Roth.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  That's all bad.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  That's rough.  Oh, boy.  Look, I can't even agree to that.  Oh, boy.  I can't even take the...  No, it couldn't be.  Here's more BCN production.  You would think after 17 years, 17 years of losing, that you'd get used to it. 
[01:05:30]  But you don't get used to losing, do you, Greg?  It hurts a lot.  So let's add a little bit to your pain.  Every weekday morning at 6, it's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's static-free, crystal clear, HD stereo, the Rock of Boston, 104.1 WBCN.  I got to tell you, we're on a different BCN, and I love it. 
[01:06:00]  I love the attitude these guys have up there in Boston.  I'm angry.  Dave Wellington, right?  Yeah.  Dave is rocking.  The best one's coming here?  Eddie from...  This is the reason...  Sorry.  Eddie from PA.  Mayor of Mantown?  McGreevy.  He's getting back into politics.  Ex-Jersey governor is running for mayor of Mantown.  This is the reason the Mantown Morning Show is in morning. 
[01:06:30]  Opie and Anthony on WBCN.  Why was that one the best one?  No, I thought...  That was the most boring one.  Is this true Mantown javalogs and bikini teenies for everyone?  T-cells are optional.  Yuck.  By the way, if people are wondering why we didn't go back to AF, there's a fine lady named 
[01:07:00]  Julie Kahn who hates our guts, who said she'd quit the company before she'd have us back.  Well, what is that?  Well, now you're going to have to pay Julie.  Right.  Julie Kahn.  What's that broad do?  She's the...  Julie Kahn.  What is she?  No one likes her.  Julie Kahn.  Now stop.  Now stop.  There you go.  What's that?  There you go. 
[01:07:30]  That might have worked.  I don't think the other two did.  Come on.  It had a word.  No way.  Why?  Because it's one word.  No, it's not.  You kind of made it one word.  Did we get through?  Put a lot of N's in it.  All right.  Let me try it again.  So we didn't go back to AF because this lady, Julie, she didn't want us to work there.  And she said she would quit before she had us back.  Julie Kahn.  No.  No. 
[01:08:00]  A little silence.  Now we got to stop doing it all together.  Why?  Because then it's just too much.  All right.  How about if you do this?  Yeah.  I don't know what's wrong with Julie Kahn.  I don't care.  Okay.  You said don't.  Julie Kahn may feel like this show is unpleasant.  But if Julie Kahn doesn't want to work with this program, we certainly understand. 
[01:08:30]  That's okay because there's plenty of words in between.  All right.  Very good.  Jesus Christ.  So we're going to have a lot of fun as far as taking on our old place.  Mantown.  I don't know how we compete with Mantown, but we'll try.  We're going down to Mantown and that is Friday night at Mantown.  Throw on some Liberace.  Look at the pictures on the wall of Rock Hudson.  Three guys toasting each other with shot glasses full of a bleachy substance. 
[01:09:00]  You chug yours, I'll throw mine on your back.  LOL.  Mantown stinks.  We're going to Mantown.  Are you?  Are you?  Yeah.  What do we have to look forward to when we get there?  Wow.  That does sound brutal.  Do you know who designed Mantown?  What architect?  Mike Brady. 
[01:09:30]  Honey, could you get me some more coffee?  I'm going to be working late in the office tonight.  I've got to get this Mantown project done.  I've got this building shaped like one.  So is this one.  Dad, Dad, Dad, why does one town have nine bathhouses?  You wouldn't understand yet, son.  Some of the other things BCN is doing with the O&A production.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony reminding you to never rat on your friends.  Always keep your mouth shut.  And this is the Rock of Boston.  104.1 WBCN. 
[01:10:00]  The station's really gone to the dogs.  Hey, we're Opie and Anthony.  We're on from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.  But we thought we'd drop in and say this is the Rock of Boston WBCN because we're good like that.  No, we're not.  This is a recorded voice, you dummy. 
[01:10:30]  On 104.1 WBCN.  That's stunk.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You can hear us.  Mornings on WBCN.  The rest of the day.  The rest of the day.  You can hear this.  This is how we do it.  It's one of those days.  Okay, not really.  You can hear this. 
[01:11:00]  The Rock of Boston.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony, and this is the Rock of Boston 104.1 WBCN.  Who gives a s**t?  That's funny.  Make that into a promo, h*****er. 
[01:11:30]  A script.  I love a script.  Say, Opie, did you know that we're back on WBCN?  Why, yes, Anthony.  Mornings, I believe.  Does it sound like we're reading this Opie?  Why, yes, Anthony.  I believe it does.  Rock of Boston.  There you go.  They're doing some good things up in Boston.  I like the aggression.  I love that.  Yeah, I want to just give them props today.  It's a new WBCN.  It has a lot of attitude, and I like that. 
[01:12:00]  God damn Rich Julie Kahn.  L-O-L.  Bobby, Peter, Gregg.  Come on, I want us to all go downstairs to Mantown.  No, the girls can stay up here.  Bring your bathrobes.  Oh, but Dad, I don't like Mantown.  It hurts.  And why do we all have to wear leopard-skin bathing suits? 
[01:12:30]  Now that's just what we do in Mantown, Peter.  Come on, boys.  We're all going to bring Oliver, too.  Yes, I don't care.  I've designed it just with your boys in mind.  Mantown.  I think it's going to be pretty easy in Boston, to be honest with you.  We don't like being cocky, but I think it's going to be pretty easy in Boston.  I don't want to compete with Mantown, dude. 
[01:13:00]  We've got some challenges around America, but I think Boston's going to be an easy one,  I've got to say.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  O.B. Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Welcome to Mantown. 
[01:13:30]  I'm here with the rest of the crew.  Pants are optional.  O.B., did you bring the K-Y?  Mantown.  The official song, by the way, we found out about Mantown.  Yes.  Let's go to Jack in Fort Jefferson.  Jack, what's going on?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Today's Mantown forecast, mostly cloudy and a chant of, it's raining men.  Hallelujah. 
[01:14:00]  It's raining men.  It's raining men in Mantown.  Mantown.  I hear people are settling in Mantown and loving the place.  Gary Glitter just got an apartment in Mantown.  Big statue of Freddie Mercury when you drive in.  Wonderful.  Mantown.  Mantown blows.  By the way, you can play along at home because they're going to dump out of us.  But Matt in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  I just imagine James T. Kirk screaming, 
[01:14:30]  Khan.  Come on.  Every man ought to be a muscle, muscle man.  That better made it through.  Of course.  I'm a professional broadcast.  Sonny Ferelli, what's up?  Make it fast.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  One of our pests from Boston, by the way.  He's a great O&A pest.  Sonny Ferelli, yes. 
[01:15:00]  Go.  I used to do my own sticker stops before you guys went on to Free FM, and I couldn't give  these things away.  People didn't even have no idea that you were back on the air.  You guys have been on CBS now for about, what, a month and a half?  Yeah.  And I got people pulling me over for WoW stickers in Boston.  Awesome.  Nice.  Awesome.  Yeah, get the local WoW stickers for us, will you?  I sure will, guys.  If they'll give them to me, I've been trying to get them.  But, you know, hey, CBS, come on.  Give me some WoW stickers.  All right.  We'll stop by BCN and get a whole bunch of WoW stickers. 
[01:15:30]  Dave, Sonny Ferelli is going to stop by for a whole bunch of WoW stickers.  He'll help you out.  Thanks, Sonny.  Thanks.  Steve from Bayshore has got a little more insight on Mantown.  Apparently, every building there is marked Entry in Rear.  You're not even allowed to go through the front door of the building, which is weird.  Maybe the parking lots are back there.  I don't know the layout.  I guess.  And they had an overabundance of people that wanted works with the sewer company.  Yeah.  Because they heard they'd be working in manholes. 
[01:16:00]  And that got them very, very excited.  I think the Mantown jokes are over.  I don't think so.  They're just beginning.  Let's go to Jim in Boston.  Jim, what's up?  There's a three-block area in your neighborhood where all the sex offenders might be moving to.  What's it called?  Mantown.  Let's go to Kim in Jersey.  Kim.  Hi.  I was wondering if you guys can tell me, is there a lush soap store in Mantown?  Wow.  All right.  This girl goes back a ways. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  Thank you, Kim.  A couple of faggy moments on this very program, weren't there?  Oh, lush.  We're not saying we don't have some faggy moments, but we don't call our show Mantown.  We don't stake out a perimeter and give it a town name.  That's right.  Mantown.  We just look at chicks and then go home and wash with apple butter.  Watch out how queer as we are.  Let's go to Herman in Pittsburgh.  Herman.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up, Herman?  Hey, I got to tell you. 
[01:17:00]  You think Boston's easy.  Pittsburgh's going to be a cakewalk for you.  We don't know much about the Pittsburgh radio market yet.  Maybe someone could help us out with that.  They're going nuts.  There's a big demand for wow stickers right now.  Oh, good.  That sounds great.  Cool.  Well, we're living here in Mantown, and we're pulling all our underwear down.  Mantown.  It can't be this easy.  Stop it.  Someone's joking with us.  Right. 
[01:17:30]  The shack out back.  No one's going to suck.  We want the shack.  Anyone who goes to Mantown, that's what's going to suck.  No walking.  You have to, like, get on your knees and, like, hobble along on your knees.  Is this true?  What?  What?  The entire city of San Francisco is calling Mantown a bunch of faggots.  It can't be true.  Mantown.  Why would you even call it?  You could come up with a different name for it, and it would still be maybe okay. 
[01:18:00]  I don't.  It's just hacky radio.  It's, you know.  They had their fun.  They're going to get destroyed in the ratings.  I guarantee it.  We were hoping it was going to take a little while, but it's pretty obvious it's not going  to.  And the welcome to Mantown sign has a little movie quote on it.  Yeah?  It says, welcome to Mantown.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  That's cool.  I like that movie, Airplane.  All right.  We can do the rest of the show. 
[01:18:30]  Just make fun of Mantown.  Too easy.  We really tried to do a lot of material in one day.  Yeah.  Well, we got the graduate.  We just did this bit with a 70-year-old, but now the 80-year-old trumped the 70-year-old.  Everyone's got to top someone else.  So here's an 80-year-old college graduate.  That's a quick one.  Betty McNeil vowed to get her college degree before her grandchildren, and she did it.  82 years old.  McNeil graduated on Thursday from Harvard University.  You go, girl.  To some respects, though, she's no different than some of her classmates. 
[01:19:00]  Sure.  Well, I'm a procrastinator.  And actually, I wrote my essay on procrastination and turned it in about a half an hour before it was due.  He's turning it in a half an hour late.  McNeil spent nine years getting her liberal arts degree.  She retired last year after 25 years with Harvard's health services department.  Nine years.  Truly young at heart, isn't she?  That's never too old.  Good for her.  And it probably was free, too, because if you work for Harvard.  She's got a deal, right? 
[01:19:30]  I got a little bit of a deal there.  Good for her.  Aw, see, it's such a feel-good story.  It really is.  Nine years.  Enough with the feel-good stories.  They stink.  Lazy bitch.  Why did it take nine years?  She started when she was, what, 73 years old?  And where'd she graduate from?  Harvard.  Harvard.  From Harvard.  That's a merchant degree.  There is some poor son of a bitch that can't afford to go to Harvard that would have loved that free seat.  Or just missed a cut.  Right.  Because they had to let the 80-year-old broad in a seat.  80 years old.  What's she going to do with her Harvard degree? 
[01:20:00]  82 years young.  Young.  Oh.  Get Alzheimer's and use it as a napkin.  Just wiping her mouth with it.  This past is cold.  That's your degree, you idiot.  She, she...  I had a thought.  Oh, her procrastination joke was funny, though.  Yes, it was.  It was wonderful.  She puts things off.  She must have had the old class laughing.  Well, that's not the only old lady in the news today.  We got the 80-year-old grandma that thwarted a robber. 
[01:20:30]  Thwarted.  Off.  Thwarted.  Thwarted.  I hate that word.  A robber.  This is always cute when it works out this way.  Because it usually works out with some gray hair on the sidewalk with a little bit on a brick right next to it.  They never, they're never successful at fighting back.  This idiot doesn't realize she won lotto here.  Absolutely.  Why do they say robber?  Just say Puerto Rican.  Really must be getting a ribbing from the rest of the criminal community. 
[01:21:00]  Was that you?  Sounds like she fought off a robber from Mantown.  Maybe that was it.  Oh.  It was a little...  I like your skirt.  Oh.  A little too weak.  Mantown.  Oh.  Really hit her hard with the brick.  He could barely lift it.  He tried to take her purse, but it didn't match his shoes, so he gave it back.  LOL.  Well, here's the story.  It's just horrific.  Hear what she did.  And turning to the story of the week, an 86-year-old woman turned the tables on a... 
[01:21:30]  No, I think the story of the week might be something else.  Yeah.  The story of the week.  It might be something else.  I don't know.  Anyone want to take a guess what the story of the week might be?  Check the covers of every paper around the country.  Yep.  Maybe that's the story of the week.  Not this old broad swing in an umbrella.  And turning to the story of the week, an 86-year-old woman turned the tables on a would-be robber.  Elizabeth Rubin was window shopping on 34th Street Wednesday when someone tried to grab  her bag containing the cornbread she bakes for her friends. 
[01:22:00]  She quickly found out that an umbrella can protect you from more than just the rainy weather.  There's one of the friends that hate the cornbread.  Would this bitch stop bringing it?  Look, why don't we rob her, steal the cornbread, and she'll stop bringing it.  Yeah, she was holding the cornbread.  Old burden.  Old burden.  Handing out treats that nobody enjoys.  Probably all flaky.  Oh, you know she brings the cornbread over.  It just smells like her own waste.  Because of her dumb fingers.  Horrid. 
[01:22:30]  Gnarled up arthritic fingers making the cornbread thinking people appreciate it.  She doesn't notice as she leaves the apartment that cornbread is being thrown at her.  And the birds are looking at it and just going, no.  I'd rather eat garbage juice.  This old bag in her cornbread should just drop dead.  Scott from Ron Conkoma, by the way.  Backing up a little bit.  The Man Town gang Cree.  We don't need no stinking vagus.  I helped him.  He had another word, but they would have dumped out.  But I think vagus actually works better. 
[01:23:00]  But good one, Scott.  Ron Conkoma, there you go.  It's the rainy weather.  And then go down there and take it like this.  I would say for police, let me beat him up.  You could do it, right?  Oh, yes.  Right?  And we believe you, Liz.  The suspect got away, but he left her cornbread and $5 that was also in the purse on the sidewalk.  He knew better.  He knew better.  People who were there apparently didn't really help out.  People just kept on running by. 
[01:23:30]  They just kept walking by.  Of course they did.  Trains to catch, right?  Would not mess with her.  No, definitely not.  Do not mess with her.  Do not mess with her.  Definitely not.  Get the grandma in here.  Let's see how good she really is.  I'll punch her right in the mouth.  Give me that marble rye, you old bag.  Don't mess with her.  Really?  Get her in here.  Left the cornbread, of course.  Five bucks in cornbread in her old lady purse.  Her apartment must just smell.  Festering diapers by the bed.  Why doesn't she just die? 
[01:24:00]  Can we get Sabra Cadabra back in here?  I saw her on the newscast.  She had one of those walkers with the handbrakes on them.  Like granny's going to get up to 60.  And he needs to really slam on those brakes.  If you have a walker that needs the handbrakes, oh, you are a burden.  I'm sorry.  She'll just be walking around on a dog leash.  Well, here's the deal.  We're just really goofing off today, having a lot of fun.  It's kind of Jimmy Day.  No filter.  Paul's in studio.  He got the band Sabra Cadabra to perform. 
[01:24:30]  I think there's other surprises that Ant and I don't even know about, Jimmy.  So we'll see what happens as the day goes on.  But later today, we're definitely going to be at Tower Records, 66th Street, excuse me,  and Broadway at 6 p.m.  Jimmy's going to be there signing copies of his HBO One Night Stand DVD.  XM was kind enough to buy a lot of copies of that.  Yeah, that's great, man.  Also, we got some premiere episodes of Lucky Louie that you're going to be signing.  And I think Free FM in New York is going to be there with WOW stickers and WOW shirts.  It's our first appearance that's coming back to commercial radio, so we're very excited. 
[01:25:00]  So if you're in the area, it's Tower Records, 66th Street and Broadway.  And I want to thank Tom and Mark and everybody here.  They paid for all the equipment, and they really did it up nicely.  So thank you guys here for helping out with that, man.  It's really nice.  And, you know, we got to call out XM.  We would have done this at XM, but we still have no place for bands to play.  Stop complaining.  Even though we asked for it well over a year and a half ago.  So retyping guy.  All right. 
[01:25:30]  Without further ado, it's Sabra Cadabra.  SabraCadabra.com.  How do you spell that, no filter, Paul?  It's S-A-B-B-R-A-C-A-D-A-B-R-A.com.  Sabra just with two Bs.  All right.  Very good.  Got it.  And, Jimmy, this is your favorite Black Sabbath tribute band, right?  Without a doubt, yeah.  Florentine turned me on to these guys, and they just did great, man.  They're the only ones I really love.  All right, guys.  Rock us the commercial, all right?  It's the only virus spreading across America.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  Sabra Cadabra. 
[01:26:00]  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  This is Sabra Cadabra.  We'll be right back. 
[01:26:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:27:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:27:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:28:00]  We'll be right back.

[01:29:30]  In studio, Sapkadabra.  Sapkadabra.  Sapkadabra.  Sapkadabra. 
[01:30:00]  He's got to see now to live this place to be my one and only time.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:30:30]  Wow, there you go.  Nice.  Put us back into the show.  SabraCadabra.com.  One for Jimmy right there.  Thank you, sweeties.  One of Jimmy's favorite Black Sabbath songs, right?  If not my favorite, yeah.  If not your favorite.  I don't even know the name of it.  I've got to be honest.  It's a national acrobat.  Okay, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Bropy.  That's the song you come out to, though, right? 
[01:31:00]  That's my walk-out music, yeah.  There you go.  You ought to use Paperback Writer by the Beatles.  Voss is such a boob.  We all did shows, and you walk on to bigger shows, you walk on to music.  And stupid Voss walks on to Paperback Writer.  Paperback Writer.  He can't read, and he's too stupid to spell correctly.  How ironic.  He walks on to that 58-year-old jackass.  What's the matter?  Didn't you have Eleanor Rigby queued up?  Fool.  My brother's hanging with us today, and he has an observation about Jimmy Day. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, no.  Well, it is a holiday, and on Christmas, you got your basic Christmas carolers.  But on Jimmy Day, you got tattooed maniacs in complete black playing on Sabbath.  So I just thought that was worth pointing out.  Instead of carolers.  Oh, you bombed just as bad as I do.  I'll give you one.  You're not immune.  Here's the beauty of Elmo.  It's nice to know it runs in the family. 
[01:32:00]  No, but Elmo was like, that's what you get here.  It was fun to listen to it after, like, that's what you get on this day.  Yeah, right here, now.  Yeah.  This day.  Because, like, there's nothing worse.  That's like swinging the bat and doing, like, the layered spin.  It's like, you don't want people to remember the miss.  Don't see that I just missed.  Tattooed maniacs singing.  I mean, it's what you're going to get if you come here today.  Yeah.  It's Friday, you know.  My sister will be calling in with an observation in the next half hour, by the way, to help us out. 
[01:32:30]  Hey, in studio, we got big A in Twitchels.  I know, that old gag.  I get it.  That old gag is back in the studio.  I pay attention to a lot of the feedback that comes in.  It's a very small percentage of people that write to message boards and my MySpace account and things like that.  But I get information.  And, guys, people seem to be getting a little sick of you.  Don't take it personally. 
[01:33:00]  Don't think.  Just some people.  Not everybody.  I'm getting sick of me.  Some people find you.  Don't try to do the self-deprecating thing with saying, I'm getting sick of me.  No, no, seriously.  Which is going to then endear you to everybody that's sick of you.  They're getting sick of me.  More of you, Twitchels, than big A.  I've been reading that.  They're getting a little tired of them.  You know what's great about a radio show?  When you get sick of something, you're able to move on to other things.  You can kill it.  But in your real life, you know you're sick of some of the members in your family. 
[01:33:30]  But you can't fade them out of the program and bring in new characters.  You've got to get a robo.  Cinderblock.  That's what I love about radio.  When we finally get sick of people, we're like, all right, enough of you.  And we bring in new, exciting people.  It's like virtually whacking them.  But in your everyday life, you've got those friends.  You're sick of them.  But what are you going to do?  You can't just say goodbye to your friends like it's a radio show.  You're stuck with them.  Thank God we're not stuck with big A and Twitchels.  Nope.  Whenever we want. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Maybe we just won't accept the phone call or have you on as much.  Phase it out kind of a thing.  Like a slow troop withdrawal or something.  Yeah.  And then before you know it, everyone's home.  So, Twitchels, what have you been up to since the last time you were on the show?  Ah, shut up.  That's why you bring me here.  That's why.  That's funny. 
[01:34:30]  You bastard.  You've been doing your comedy there.  What was the tour?  Short Puzz Comedy Tour.  Short Puzz Comedy Tour.  Still going on?  Yeah, we're still going on with that.  We're doing really well with that.  We had a couple shows coming up.  Angel Dice Tourette's.  Brain Go. 
[01:35:00]  So I got my tongue up this chick's.  You, you, you, hickory dickory dog, this chick was so good, bring.  You're a wreck.  I love it.  Big A, how you been?  Big A's the star, by the way.  By the way, yeah, and when I ask how he's been and you hear silence, it's him trying 
[01:35:30]  to talk.  And by the way, we're not sick of you, Big A.  Thank you, Obie.  No.  We just say that because I know he could smother us with a pillow anytime he wants.  He does have that male nurse look to him.  Awful wrinkled slacks.  Can we dress him in a male nurse outfit one day, please?  Oh, a light blue type?  Yeah, please.  Oh, yes.  Just have him walking around with a pillow.  And we'll have a photo shoot with him in a pillow.  Doing the walk with the smothering old people on the sidewalk. 
[01:36:00]  That's how we should do the walkover.  We have an old lady on a gurney, and Andrew is pushing her, and she has a pillow over  her face.  She can breathe, but that's the visual I want.  By the way, you know, the instant feedback is much different.  They're begging us not to get rid of Big A and Twitchels and the news bid and stuff.  We're going to try something different today.  We're going to do movie scenes, right?  Yeah, we've done this before with the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Yep.  But now we're going to try it with these two.  I think we did it with Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  You know, by the way, we haven't told this side of the Opie and Anthony show about what 
[01:36:30]  happened with Stalker Patty on the other side of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, right.  I sent you guys an email.  What?  You didn't get my email?  No.  Who didn't get my email?  I didn't get your email.  I sent an email yesterday.  Wait, there's an update on Stalker Patty?  Yeah, she sent a message to my MySpace about how people are criticizing her and calling  her.  Jesus H. Christ.  No one checked my email?  No, I don't read them.  I'm getting looks around here like, what the hell are you talking about?  No, no, that's great. 
[01:37:00]  Dude, I never got an email from you.  It was a response email to something.  That's probably why.  He just read the response.  And then I get 8,000 emails a day now, which is wonderful.  I'm going to be alone, everybody.  Well, for this side of the Opie and Anthony show, Stalker Patty joined us at XM, and we  finally had it.  She's a 51-year-old virgin, and she's never even had an O.  She's never even had an O.  Nope.  So we said, screw that.  You're having an O today.  Today.  And without getting into graphic details, Stalker Patty had an O on the second half of the 
[01:37:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we brought out all kinds of stuff.  And it was horrific.  And Jimmy helped.  And it was live on Pal Talk.  Still don't have the Pal Talk cameras over here.  We're waiting for XM.  I think it's going to finally happen next week.  Tuesday.  She had the dumbest face I've ever seen on a human.  Oh.  When that was happening.  It was like surprise and shock from a bad movie.  That's what she looked like.  It was so unsexy that it belonged in man town. 
[01:38:00]  Man town.  So the update, Anthony.  So everyone's saying what?  Uh, she sent me.  I'm trying to look for the, uh, the email, which is now annoying me that, that no one  got it.  I can't believe I sent it to everybody.  Angel.  So if anybody's got an email from me, is anyone checking their email accounts?  We check every day.  I didn't get an email.  I'm telling you.  I just delete them.  Something must have happened.  That's what I do.  Something must have happened to them.  Well, she's saying that, um, she's upset. 
[01:38:30]  A lot of people on pal talk and the message boards are calling her a whore.  She is.  And, uh, and saying that that isn't what she should be doing.  And, uh, like who are the people that are bitching at her for this?  She had the first like good physical sensation of her life and, uh, they're bitching at her  for it.  And she wants to know if we would really have kicked her off the show if she didn't do  this and to like all worried and nervous like she is all the time.  Oh, is she annoying? 
[01:39:00]  Shut up, dirty lady.  Don't worry, you filth.  She enjoyed her O and she got to bring the apparatus home with her.  Yeah.  I want to get an update from her.  Maybe if she's listening, she could call the program.  I'm working at Steel Bucks.  All right.  So why don't we do some movie scenes with Big A and Twitchells here?  Of course, for the new listeners, Twitchells has Tourette's.  Yeah, we know.  What are you waiting for?  And Big A, he hasn't been diagnosed yet.  We don't know what it is.  Big A has some kind of speech problem and, uh, OCD. 
[01:39:30]  Uh, he doesn't quite, he can't talk.  He hasn't said a word.  How are you doing today?  Shut up.  Say you're doing stupendous.  I'm...  Um, I'm doing stupendous.  Oh, he breaks it up.  He goes, stupendous.  All right.  All right.  We have a lot of movie scenes here.  Um, God, what do we want to start with?  Well, someone is asking that they do a scene from Fight Club.  We do have a Fight Club scene. 
[01:40:00]  We got Top Gun.  We got the Top Gun locker room scene, which is good.  We got a huge...  You want to start with that?  Because it's a dialogue from Sling Blade.  Jesus.  You want to hear the original or you want to hear them do it first?  And one of the greatest scenes from, uh, Clerks.  Clockwork Orange.  Clockwork Orange.  Is a gem.  All right.  Why don't we do, uh...  No.  We'll start with Top Gun locker room scene.  Because it's short.  Top Gun locker room scene.  They'll do it first and then we'll, uh, we'll play the clip.  Playing the part of Iceman will be Big A. 
[01:40:30]  All right.  And playing the part of Maverick is Twitchels.  Anthony, uh, could you set up this scene for people?  Oh, this is in the locker room.  Right.  I believe it's right after, um, Maverick, uh, and Goose got in trouble for taking their,  uh, plane below the hard deck to, uh, take out Jester.  And, uh, it wasn't, uh, it wasn't deemed a win because they went below the hard deck.  So now Iceman and Maverick are arguing about that point and gets a little personal 
[01:41:00]  in there with their towels and they're biting at each other through the air.  I believe the locker room had a big sign over it called Man Town.  Hey, by the way, Sean from Ann Arbor, Michigan, you can't get rid of Big A because then you'd  have to make fun of Opie for having the smallest, you know what, in the ring.  Oh, boy.  Big A, you're never living that down, huh?  And wait a minute.  I don't have the smallest after Big A, ass.  How do you know?  I guarantee it.  How do you know?  How does Jimmy know?  No, but I've checked it out when you didn't know. 
[01:41:30]  Oh.  You dozed off once we were on the road.  Dozed off?  Slipped your roofie.  Just downright creepy.  No, you dozed off your head on sweats.  What's wrong with one friend doing a little checking?  I have no idea of anyone's size.  I have an idea of Anthony's size from that old story that we'll tell some other day.  Oh, yeah.  I did not see Anthony's, but I heard the reaction of a girl that did.  It was a bunch of girls.  They had wanted to see.  Oh, wow.  They'd want to see.  They were leaving a strip club, and we were leaving some other club we were doing an appearance 
[01:42:00]  at, and they were all drunk and hammered, and they had seen male strippers, and they  were looking for something.  And so one of the girls goes, show us your – and used the C word for a guy.  Yeah.  And Anthony goes, you want to see?  You want to see?  I go, we've got to take trade out.  I go, I want to see a couple of you girls, your areas.  And so we made the deal.  I went around back with this motorhome thing.  Yeah, it's because there was some bachelorette party.  So they ran one of the company.  Yeah, it was a big bachelorette party.  So they all gathered around, and I unzipped. 
[01:42:30]  And I was in the front of the van because they were negotiating with me still.  Yeah.  And all I hear from the back of the motorhome van, what have you, is, oh, wow.  And then I went into panic mode because I was hung like an acorn at that particular moment.  And I'm like, I'm kind of, you know, whatever, trying to – whatever, guys do.  You know, don't dump out.  It was optimum.  Like I was at the optimum positioning where it's – it doesn't look like you're ready 
[01:43:00]  for action, but it's just before that point.  Absolutely.  So it looks like it is when you're just walking around.  It's deceptive.  It's almost like if you're eating and your arm – like if you're flexing, but it looks  like you're not flexing while you're eating.  And you're like, wow, these guys got really big arms.  They don't know you're flexing.  Right.  You're flexing a little bit.  But it's just below the point where you know something's going on.  Yeah.  Right.  So then they wanted – it was my turn, and I just pushed out because I had nothing.  I had nothing going on.  That's the only reason. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  And then Anthony – then one of the girls had to, you know, do the show.  And what did she lift up, like an awful one-piece dress?  She was huge, and she lifted up, yeah, a dress.  And you heard this out.  As her gut fell over whatever I didn't want to see.  Her lasagna belly went horrible.  Wah, wah, lasagna belly.  That's great.  I have to get a text from my sister going, ew, stop.  No, Dawn, this is my job. 
[01:44:00]  No, Dawn, it's hot.  All right.  So movie scenes.  We're going to do the Top Gun locker room scene.  So it's – I wasn't listening.  It's the scene right after.  They go in the locker room after.  Yeah, locker room, and they're arguing over what they did when they were doing their  little flight test.  All right.  Here we go.  That's – that's not what I heard.  No, we did.  We got Jester.  No, no. 
[01:44:30]  Blow the hard deck.  Does that count?  Hard deck my ass?  We nailed that son of a bitch.  Mitchell's trying to act.  Just annoying me.  Acting for your acting.  I got a great scene partner.  And then we got Ice Mouth.  Ha.  You guys really are cowboys.  What's your problem, Kazanski? 
[01:45:00]  Everyone's problem.  No, hold on.  We look for a little creativity from our staff.  Hey, Iraq.  What are you reading over there?  What are you reading?  What are you reading?  What are you reading?  Our boss wants to know.  What are you reading instead of – what are you reading?  The men's underwear section of the New York Post.  I noticed this.  That's why I quickly – before I could change the page.  What is he reading?  25% off all men's jockey underwear. 
[01:45:30]  Underwear ads in it, you faggot.  And then jump into summer.  They're Macy ads.  You're either reading Macy ads or 9-11 work haunts Inferno Man.  He's too dumb to read that.  Health officials make condoms morning after pill, teen-friendly.  Nope.  Or Fat Nick's fate now rests with jury.  Nope.  Why wouldn't you be looking for Danger Zone that we could play in the background very low  and these guys could do the scene from the movie with a little more familiarity?  The music of Top Gun. 
[01:46:00]  That's a very valid question.  I was just wondering.  He's kicked back, his feet up like Ralph Cramden at Mr. Marshall's desk before Bill walked in.  Hello, Bill.  Trying to convince Bill he ran the bus company?  That's how you looked.  Play some music.  Just a grown man perusing underwear ads.  Fruit.  Man rock. 
[01:46:30]  Do you have something?  All right.  Here we go.  Start over, guys.  Here we go.  The Top Gun scene in the locker room.  Get it.  Here we go.  That's not what I heard.  No, we did.  We got Chester.  No.  No.  Below the hard deck does not count.  Hard deck, my ass.  We nailed that son of a bitch.  Huh.  You guys really are cowboys.  Ah! 
[01:47:00]  What's your problem, Kaskanski?  You're everyone's problem.  You're everyone's problem.  You're everyone's problem.  That's because every time you go up in the air, you're unsafe.  I don't like you because you're dangerous.  That's right, Ice Man. 
[01:47:30]  I am dangerous.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  I heard the bite.  That's right.  I heard the bite.  Just like a hooker's face.  Huh, Andrew?  Here's the real scene.  That's not what I heard.  Well, we did.  We got Chester.  No, no.  Below the hard deck does not count.  Hard deck, my ass.  We nailed that son of a bitch.  You guys really are cowboys.  What's your problem, Kaskanski?  You're everyone's problem.  That's because every time you go up in the air, you're unsafe. 
[01:48:00]  I don't like you because you're dangerous.  That's right.  Ice Man.  I am dangerous.  I don't like Maverick's Captain Kirk delivery there.  Ice.  That's right, Ice Man.  I am dangerous.  Yeah.  All right, which one do you want to hear next?  Bike Club, Napoleon Dynamite.  What do you want?  Something short.  Jesus Christ.  How about they do clockwork just at the beginning, a few lines, only like four lines, but without  the paragraph at the end. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  A little clockwork.  All right.  Any music we would be able to play?  How about the opening for Clockwork?  You have that?  You got it?  Oh, you actually, yeah.  Alex is a good boy.  All right, here we go.  What's the scene?  Set us up there, Jimmy.  This is when Alex wakes up.  He's been at the old man's house.  He actually, him and his boys raped and killed the guy's wife in an earlier scene.  Now Alex has been to rehabilitation.  He's been beaten up by the police, and he wakes up unknowingly at the guy's house who  he committed the crime against, and he is now nervous at the table because he realizes 
[01:49:00]  whose house he's at.  Right.  And the old man recognizes him.  Mm-hmm.  Um, please, you appreciate me.  Got to put on an English accent.  Yeah, English accent.  English accents.  Let's go.  Just sound like that idiot over there.  Where is he?  Go ahead.  Wherever the hell he went.  Um, um, please, appreciate good wine. 
[01:49:30]  Have another glass.  Wow.  You closed your eyes, you'd think you were there.  Jesus, you did no adjusting, stupid.  Thank you, sir.  That was not British.  That was not an English accent.  Oh, we're both British?  Yes!  Of course, it's clockwork orange.  You didn't indicate that.  No, he's standing in Maine, and you're in London, and you're shouting at each other.  Across the pond.  Yeah, big megaphone. 
[01:50:00]  Very, very big megaphone.  Come on.  What's the matter?  You look nervous there, white clips of Doverchin.  I don't know what that means, but I love it.  England.  Oh.  Thank you, sir.  Okay.  My wife used to do everything for me.  More English.  More English.  My wife.  And he's very upset.  My writing. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, start over there, big A.  Yell it a little bit.  Yeah.  My wife.  Gotta act a little.  My wife used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.  Your wife said, is she awake?  Yeah.  He cannot do a hint of an English accent.  Big A, why?  Have you ever heard someone from England?  Because his brain's going to explode.  Do you know what they do?  Do you know what that sounds like?  Yes, they do.  Just do it.  I've seen better acting in Lucky Louie. 
[01:51:00]  Oh.  Zero stars.  Zero stars for this performance in front of us today, fellas.  And he looks like Linda Stassi.  These are accents.  British.  Come on, British.  Go ahead.  Go.  Do the line over.  Go.  With your best British accent.  Hey, shut up.  Shut up, you.  Quiet.  Let's go, big A.  My wife. 
[01:51:30]  I can't do a British accent.  You don't have to do a British accent on mine.  If you don't do a British accent, Club Soda Kenny's going to slap you.  Not punch you or hurt you.  Just slap you.  Just lubricate his hand and slap your face.  All right, try again.  All right.  Try again.  Try again.  Go ahead.  Kenny's right there, right to slap.  Kenny's hovering over him. 
[01:52:00]  That's right, he is.  English accent.  Go ahead.  Rooting against it.  And action.  My wife used to do everything for me and lead me to my writing.  Wow.  All right.  Sounds like an American with a deeper voice.  No one's own.  I got to give him props to try.  He's trying.  Kenny is hovering over him and Big A is truly scared.  Keep it up.  What was your motivation?  I like to chew solid food. 
[01:52:30]  Twitchels, go ahead.  I can't wait for the grand finale with Big A.  That's going to be really good.  You watch this.  Is she away?  No.  No.  She's dead.  I'm sorry.  Perfectly delivered.  I'm sorry to hear that about that, sir.  She was very badly great, you see. 
[01:53:00]  She was assaulted by a gang of vicious young hoodlums.  In this house.  In this house.  It is very true. 
[01:53:30]  You are sitting in now.  I was left with a helpless, crippled, but the agony was too great.  The doctors said it was pneumonia.  It happened some months later during a flu academic. 
[01:54:00]  Economic?  Flu academic.  Flu academic.  Pneumonia during a flu academic.  Flu academic.  Dumb as they come.  The doctors told me it was pneumonia.  English accent.  You're losing it.  But I knew what it was.  A victim of the modern age.  Poor, poor girl.  And now you, another victim of modern age. 
[01:54:30]  There you go.  Excellent.  Now do it in French.  Here's the original scene.  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.  Have another glass.  Thank you, sir.  My wife used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.  Your wife, sir?  Is she away?  No, she's dead. 
[01:55:00]  I'm sorry to hear about that, sir.  She was very badly raped, you see.  We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hoodlums in this house, in this very room you are sitting in now.  I was left a helpless cripple, but for her the agony was too great.  The doctors said it was pneumonia because it happened some months later during a flu epidemic.  The doctors told me it was pneumonia, but I knew what it was.  Victim of the modern age.  Poor, poor girl.  And now you, another victim of the modern age. 
[01:55:30]  That is great.  Oh, how do you not love that scene, man?  All right, very good.  We got to take a break.  God, you two stink.  I know.  Oh, you take a scene like that and destroy it.  We'll do one more after the break, okay?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hi, everybody.  This is Travis Tritt.  Hey, folks.  My name is Henry Rowland.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan.  Hey, this is Tommy Chong, and you're listening to Pot Talk. 
[01:56:00]  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I love this.  Please refrain from the word ****.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Do it like this.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're just running out of show on this side of the Opie and Anthony program.  We did want to get one more scene in by these two idiots.  You know, we forgot to mention something, Anthony.  You got to give me a minute or two.  I wasn't sure what to do with this, but it's just bothered me to a point. 
[01:56:30]  I got to bring it up.  Because we talk about what happens behind the scenes and in our lives and stuff.  Yesterday, after the XM show, we came back over here to Free FM in New York City, and we had a great meeting with some very creative people.  They're working on a TV commercial for the Opie and Anthony Show.  TV campaign.  That'll be, the commercial's going to be aired in New York and in probably all the other cities that we're broadcasting to.  And it was a great meeting.  And Tom Chiasano did tell us during the meeting that Boyd Gary was going to be heading over to this facility to take a look at all the stuff. 
[01:57:00]  They got to get back to Howard in that dumb settlement they had recently.  Yeah.  And I didn't think anything of it.  I'm like, oh, yeah, whatever.  Blah, blah, blah, you know?  And I got to tell you, Tom Chiasano, we like working for the guy.  We really like him a lot.  And we're very surprised at that, by the way.  Tom is one of the best bosses I've ever had so far.  He's a very smart man, and he stays out of our way, and he gets this type of programming, obviously. 
[01:57:30]  And he's been nothing but supportive.  But yesterday was such a weird scene that I got to talk about it for a minute.  So he tells his boy Gary he's coming by for the first time since Howard left.  And I'm like, yeah, all right, whatever.  So we finish up our TV meeting, and we're waiting in the lobby.  I'm actually waiting for my brother who's, you know, trying to steal CDs from somewhere with Ben.  And all of a sudden, Ant and I are standing there talking, and all of a sudden, we see, like, boy Gary go walking by really fast. 
[01:58:00]  And I think he saw us as well at that point.  And Ant and I go, was that Gary?  I knew we had business up here.  Yeah, I know.  And then all of a sudden, I'm still waiting for my brother, and Tom brings him back down the hall to say hi to us.  In Tom's defense, I don't know if that was the case.  Well, that's what I need to know, and I will be having a private conversation with Tom.  Over the weekend, because I don't want to have small talk with boy Gary or anyone else from that show.  Here's what happened.  They went around the part of the building here that there's no exit from. 
[01:58:30]  There's no other way to get from there to Tom's office.  So they had to come back around by the front door where we were in order to get to Tom's office to talk about whatever they were going to talk about.  So he had to either wait for us to leave or bring him right through us, which, you know, whatever.  He came up.  Well, that's what I want to find out because, you know, Tom is in a weird position.  He really likes us.  He's told us behind the scenes.  He's sitting on the air. 
[01:59:00]  He likes us a lot.  He's spent 20 years with those guys.  Yeah, I understand that.  He's very surprised at how professional we actually are and all that.  You know, he's complimented us a lot.  And he also still has a relationship with Howard.  So he's in a weird position.  You know, so I understand that.  So I want to make sure he wasn't just casually bringing Gary down the hall to say hi to us.  I hope he understands how deep this hatred goes.  It got really, really personal with me and Howard, and I don't want to have small talk with Gary or anyone else on that show. 
[01:59:30]  And before Gary goes back on Howard's show, probably Monday, because Howard doesn't work Fridays anymore.  He barely works at this point.  You know, I do want to acknowledge that, you know, boy, Gary has always been nice to us, to our face when he sees us.  But he's a two-faced ass, and he'll say something completely different on Howard's show.  So I want to tell people how it was.  You know, it was a forced handshake that barely happened.  And I turned around.  I didn't even want to, you know, talk to him.  And Anthony, the—  It was two swarthy Italians having a smarmy conversation with each other. 
[02:00:00]  And Anthony, I give him a lot of credit because he's more of a professional than me.  He talked to him for, like, you know, 30 seconds, and it was very swarmy, to say the least.  It was just a quick handshake.  And then he said something like, you know, you try to break the ice or something.  So he said something to the effect of, so I hear you got a morning show now.  And I was like, yeah, something seems to have opened up.  So we jumped in.  And that's pretty much it.  And then Tom went to go, like, take him away.  And then I go, oh, you guys meeting? 
[02:00:30]  I go, Tom, keep your mouth shut about certain things.  And he goes—and then Gary said something like, oh, he will.  And he won't talk about anything that we say either.  Like, it was just kind of a weird little thing going on.  We know because we bashed each other very personally on the air.  And radio is one of those industries where you're going to bump into these people face-to-face.  And unless you're going to—there's one extreme or the other.  There's punch people in the face.  Or there's, you know, you shake hands, you kind of sarcastically smile, and you go about your business. 
[02:01:00]  But you're hearing it right from our mouths.  That's what happened because I'm sure he'll spin it some other way because he's always been two-faced.  In Tom's defense, though, there was nowhere the way—that hallway goes to nowhere.  All right, well, that's what I'm going to find out because, you know, I understand the weird position he's in.  But I have no desire to have small talk with anybody on that show, none whatsoever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't really feel the need to sit down and have a chit-chat with anybody over there to tell you the truth. 
[02:01:30]  But unfortunately during, you know, in this business, we will bump into radio people that don't like us, that we don't like.  And it's going to happen.  But, I mean, I will be asking Tom about that this weekend, but I just couldn't, like, not bring it up.  It was a really, really strange thing.  Are you coming into work this weekend?  No.  Why?  How would you talk to Tom?  I mean, I'd call him.  A phone call to a boss?  Jesus Christ. 
[02:02:00]  I will call him, yes.  It's breaking ground over here.  That is something I just don't do.  I will call him, yes.  I have perfected the art of saying, talk to my agent.  I think he understands our position, but I want to just make sure.  I mean, we can't have that.  I mean, if he wants to continue to talk to those guys and stuff, that's his business.  That's fine.  That's absolutely fine.  He's known him for 20 years.  I mean, he's got a friendship with them.  I have no problem with that.  That could have been an ugly situation yesterday.  It really could have been an ugly situation because he's – Gary, you know, he's just a two-faced ass. 
[02:02:30]  He really is.  Every time he saw us over the years at places, he was really cool and nice to us and said,  you guys are doing a great job, this and that, blah, blah, blah.  And then he has to, you know, do the whole Howard ripoff thing with Howard on the show.  He's a soldier doing what he feels he has to do for his leader.  Well, whatever.  Then be a soldier right to our face.  That's it.  Then be a soldier right to our face.  Hmm.  So that's what happened because I'm sure it will be spun another way.  You want to do one more scene with Big A and Twitchels before we get out of here for the day? 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  Let's do the Gary Delabate Opie meeting.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't say anything to him.  And I was kind of pissed off, to be honest, with myself that I actually had a very weak handshake with him.  Did you give him the –  I was really pissed off, but I felt like Tom's there.  Things have been going great with him.  I'm like, why?  Why are we in this position?  So it was a very weak dead fish, and then I turned around.  Jimmy, he's taking things very personally. 
[02:03:30]  You think?  It's business, and he's taking things very personally.  What are you going to do?  Walk up with your Ivy League shirt and bada bing.  You got to get a gay porno mustache all over your Ivy League suit.  You know, Howard – I mean, you know, Howard had fun with, you know, what he would do with my dead dad's skull.  Let's just put it that way.  I'm not going to be –  There's no forgiving that.  I'm not going to be small talking with anyone.  And he's very lucky to didn't punch him in his face yesterday, okay?  Yes, it's very personal.  Howard thought it was real fun to go that way. 
[02:04:00]  Well, trust me, I don't forget.  There is definitely no –  Trust me, I don't forget.  No forgiving that.  And other things.  But that's the big one.  Yeah, why don't you just not do that for a minute?  Can't you just stop with the Tourette's?  How about this?  Don't do it.  We're discussing something.  He's distracted.  Let's say hi to Bob in Florida.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, I want to know if you check Gary's pockets and see if he took Howard's 11 million listeners with him. 
[02:04:30]  Man, you had a great line.  Bob, what you want to say, was Gary there to pick up the millions of listeners Howard doesn't have?  I don't have any more.  That's right.  That would have killed.  Your phone crapped out, your delivery stunk, and you're an ass.  Thank you for calling the program.  Jesus.  Jennifer doesn't get it in Manhattan.  Wow, Opie, you're so full of hate.  Stop being such an effing baby.  I hope Anthony gets his own show one of these days. 
[02:05:00]  Me too.  I mean, wait, no.  First of all, I have a lot less hate in my soul.  And Jennifer, you're just a cunt.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, please.  I'll be there at the button.  That's what you are, Jennifer.  Be there.  So you would have no problem with someone making fun of your dead dad and what should  be done with his skull?  Maybe dad touched her. 
[02:05:30]  If anyone didn't hear that, Opie said, Jennifer, you're a silly goose.  I know.  Sometimes they don't like when we goof on geese.  That's exactly what it is.  You could be a pussy in your life, Jennifer.  I'm not.  You're a goose American.  I'm proud to say I'm not a pussy.  Anyway, you want to do one more scene before we get out of here?  Try to bring the laughs back before we leave.  I want a laugh.  All right.  Which scene you want to try here? 
[02:06:00]  We got Fight Club, Napoleon Dynamite, Clerks.  The Clerks one's a little long.  You know something?  The Sling Blade one is good because it doesn't include Twitchells.  Twitchells, what is going on here with you and Anthony?  Shut up.  Anthony, you don't like Twitchells?  The Clerks one.  No, no.  I like Twitchells.  I'm kidding with him.  I didn't like Twitchells a little snotty with Opie before.  I didn't care for that.  Were you snotty with me?  I wasn't snotty. 
[02:06:30]  The best part is when you tell him shut up or stop, he has to do one last noise.  Yeah, of course he did.  You know what it is?  I'll give you an example.  You know when we do the news, do the end of the news where you go,  I'm Big A, and then you do what you do.  Go ahead.  Just the very end.  Sign off.  You.  No, no.  You first.  I'm Big A.  And I'm Twitchells.  No.  No, you don't do it like that.  Sign off like you normally do.  Sign off like you normally do. 
[02:07:00]  With the same enthusiasm.  Go ahead.  I'm Big A.  And I'm Twitchells.  It's not the way you say it.  No.  How do I say it?  You always say this is, you say your whole name.  You say your whole name.  Oh.  And you say it with a statement.  No, no, no.  There's been several times where it's written differently on the paper, so I just say whatever  they write.  All right.  One more time.  With the same enthusiasm.  Yeah.  I'm Big A.  And I'm Lewis Twitchells Santani.  Oh.  I hate that. 
[02:07:30]  When you kill yourself.  We hate when you say your whole name.  Then why don't they write it?  I hate it.  Okay.  They write Big A on his paper and they write Lewis Twitchells Santani on mine every time.  It's just how you say it.  Lewis Twitchells Santani.  Anthony hates your name.  Oh.  The way you say it.  No one knows that you're laughterbylue.com.  Like it's Walter Twitchells Cronkite.  Like we should know.  Oh.  And I get the bad reputation.  You should hear some of the stuff Anthony says behind the scenes.  Oh.  He hates you.  He hates your name. 
[02:08:00]  I hate Danny.  And he thinks you're very tired and overdone on this program.  Right, Anthony?  Is that what you were saying?  No, that's quoting Wackback.  You guys call me.  All right?  You call me.  Oh, hey.  You call me.  I travel to.  Well, maybe the phone won't ring anymore.  I travel to.  Shut up.  Maybe that call is a little too much for you.  Two and a half hours every time I come here.  Shut up.  That's because your car goes like three feet forward and eight feet backwards. 
[02:08:30]  You're like Tourette to the foot.  Stepping on the brake.  Yeah.  Smash into the guardrail.  To the right.  Dope.  All right.  We're done with you guys.  I don't.  No, I have nothing against you except for your.  Lewis.  Twitchell Santani.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That just bugs me.  Take the Lewis and the Santani and throw it out.  It's gone.  Someone once told Opie this.  I'll always say Twitchell.  All right.  A program director once told Opie this and he took it to heart.  It's either Greg Hughes or Opie.  Yep.  Not Greg Opie Hughes, not Greg Hughes, or it could be Greg Hughes or it could be Opie. 
[02:09:00]  Not Opie Hughes and not Greg Opie Hughes.  That guy was Stan Main.  See?  And then you said.  Who's running one of the stations that we're on in Rochester.  Hey, how about that?  Look, see?  There's a whole cluster of stations.  We're on one of them.  Stan Main, I believe, runs that.  And he was the one that said it's either Opie or Greg Hughes.  Hey, we got to get out of here.  It's the first half of the Opie and Anthony show is done.  We'll do more movie scenes at XM, I guess, for a little while.  It's kind of Jimmy Day.  Hopefully you'll join us later today, 6 p.m. 
[02:09:30]  We're going to be at Tower Records, 66th Street, and Broadway.  Jimmy's got tons of stuff to sign.  Ant and I will be there.  A lot of the members of the show will be there.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  So if you're in the area, please stop by and say hi and get some free stuff.  Tower Records, 66th Street, and Broadway, okay?  Sabra Kedabra in the house.  They're going to play us out.  You guys, if you're not joining us at XM for the second half of the show,  have a great weekend.  Here we go.  Sabra Kedabra.  Sabra Kedabra.  Sabra Kedabra.

[02:12:30]  I think we're on.  We were stuck upstairs  watching the rest of the performance  from Sabra  Sabra Kadabra.  They did a great job of Paranoid.  We had to cut the song off  because they had to go to commercials  and then we just all  stayed in the studio  and checked it out.  It's almost Jimmy Day  and there are, I don't know,

This is a collection of creeps with Breathe Right strips.  I love the fact they wear Breathe Right strips.  Mavericks in the radio world here.  Yeah, that's what they call us.

By ourselves.  No one joins us when it rains.  Yeah, no one joins us.  Yeah, we happen to get a nice day for a couple of hours, I think, and then it's going to fucking  rain again.  But, yeah, we got a great crowd here today.  Wow.  Yes, really nice.  A lot of people, a lot of signs.  They're leading the way here.  Did you guys see the guy in the bathroom?

We're going to go this way.  My mom just blew my dad.  When Elmo had a bad joke, he runs in the family.  Happy Jimmy Day.  Happy Jimmy Day to everyone as we cross the street.  57th Street here.

[02:18:30]  How about any girls?  Any girls?  No.  Please.  What's that?  Let's have some monster rain, Jimmy.  When we get over to XM, I'm very happy.  His sign says, meet me under the porch, yes.  Definitely.  Oh, look at the pictures of me when I was young.  Little baby Jimmy cancers.  Oh, who is cuter than me?  Hold on.  I think no one.  Presenting you with a...  You feel that your first career didn't take off as well.  Awarded to Big Daddy James for being funky fly fresh, word up on the hype, tip crack a fool. 
[02:19:00]  And the award is not...  It's a statue of a horse's ass.  It's just a horse's ass, which is exactly what Big Daddy James was.  Oh, that is...  Please get that on film.  A complete horse's ass.  God, this is...  Anybody else?  Anybody else have something for little Jimmy Norton?  A horse's ass.  Something they want to say?  A sign we haven't seen yet?  Oh, that makes...  I got AIDS from Jim Norton.  Huh?  Yeah, I don't think...  Which sign is this?  Which one is this?  Oh, I see Flea is here.  What's up, Flea? 
[02:19:30]  We are standing on a corner and completely blocking...  Who cares?  Good.  Fuck him in the mouth.  That's what I say.  Fancy man coming through.  Step aside.  Step aside.  I like it.  They've been leading the way.  All right.  You guys should lead the way.  As soon as this light changes.  I love it.  We'll go up this small hill to XM.  We've still got to cross 6th Avenue.  The horse's ass.  Avenue of the Americas, they call it, ladies and gentlemen.  A little New York history for you.  And here we go.  We just got the universal signal for walk because there's no more fucking English in this city.  Fancy man coming through. 
[02:20:00]  Fancy man.  Fancy man coming through.  That's right.  Fancy man.  You people out of the crosswalk.  That's right.  Don't make eye contact with the fancy man.  Don't look at him.  No, looking at the fancy man.  Don't look at him.  Avert your eyes.  That's right.  You don't deserve to look at him.  Don't gaze upon the eyes of the fancy man.  Hello, Mac.  How are you doing, Mac?  It's not about you today, Mac.  It's about Jimmy Norton.  It's not Mac Day.  Didn't you read that sign? 
[02:20:30]  White man coming through.  Whoops.  I mean.  Well.  LOL.  Who's handing out the sabra-cadabra stuff?  Those guys were great today, man.  Yes.  Where's Paul?  Is he handing out their stuff?  God, do all these guys have AIDS?  Where's the energy?  Let's go.  Yeah.  Fuckers.  Oh.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Step aside, people.  That's right.  Fancy people.  Don't even look.  Avert your eyes. 
[02:21:00]  There's nothing to see here.  Don't you look at him.  Mind your beeswax, uncut foreigner.  Oh.  All right.  Well.  No sneaking peeks.  Oh.  Breathe right, Strip.  You must be a fan.  Everyone has breathe right strips.  All right, man.  This horse's ass trophy is my favorite.  Isn't that hysterical?  Holy shit.  Because who was a bigger horse's ass, Jimmy, than you back then?  Nobody was.  I think we have to take Jimmy Day, the parade, all the way up.  We have to. 
[02:21:30]  A little further.  We have to go all the way.  Let's go to seventh.  All the way.  Let's go to seventh.  Keep going.  Let's go to seventh.  Keep going.  We've got to show people what a fancy, lovely gentleman, Jimmy Norton is.  Big Daddy James.  Step aside, people.  Fancy Jimmy coming through.  This is why we love our listeners.  They took it upon themselves to take the Jimmy Day thing and run with it.  Yep.  Some funny fuckers, man.  There's a lot of funny signs, Jimmy.  Huh?  Thanks, sir.  No one touches Jimmy.  He's much too fancy. 
[02:22:00]  This is a special day for him.  We've got a big signing tonight at Tower Records, the Lincoln Center.  HBO One Night Stand.  Yes, HBO One Night Stand.  Handing out some Lucky Louies.  It's Jimmy Day, family.  It's Jimmy Day.  Jimmy Day.  Hello, hello, hello.  You distract the parents, I'll grab the kid.  What happened?  What happened?  What's that, Jimmy?  I said, you distract the parents, I'll grab the kid.  Young lad.  When do the mics crap out?  Puzzle his hair.  Yeah.  Show him what Jimmy Day's about.  Take advantage of those memories, son. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, I'm so happy.  Listen to the fucker.  So, it's a Jimmy Day.  Oh, this is great.  All right.  Mind your business.  Avert your eyes.  The guy in the robe.  The guy in the robe.  It's just a collection of creeps.  That's why we love them.  Awful.  We attract garbage.  All our fans stink, literally.  Thank you.  I think we're going to lose the mic soon.  Another Uncle Junior. 
[02:23:00]  All right.  Right about here, we lose the mics.  Right about there.  You got like 100 feet.  We got 100 feet.  Ah, sure.  All right.  We'll stop.  We're going to lose the microphone.  There's not enough room.  We all have to sit in cubicles if we invited you up.  And I want to give some acknowledgement to Happy Typing Girl.  Yes.  If it wasn't for her, a lot of these people wouldn't be here.  Where is Happy Typing Girl?  Happy Typing Girl!  Why, did she save their lives?  Yep.  Where is Happy Typing Girl?  Where is she?  See?  Where'd she go?  They're beeping on the streets of New York for Jimmy Day. 
[02:23:30]  Where's Happy Typing Girl?  Where'd she go?  Oh, she's on a mission?  Oh, I wanted to thank her.  There's not a surprise that we don't even know about Jimmy, so we'll see what happens when  we get upstairs to XM.  I hope that mission ends in a load for Happy Little Jimmy.  Give me those ribs, Ant.  All right.  Anyone else got anything for Jimmy?  Well, I got to say, thank you guys.  Thank you all for coming out on the first annual Jimmy Day.  Annual?  Annual?  What are you talking about on annual Jimmy Day?  You're right.  I apologize.  For the first monthly Jimmy Day, thank you for coming out. 
[02:24:00]  You did it once.  We got 11 more of these coming up.  One and done.  People, what do you say we knock over this watch and jewelry store?  Everyone, come on.  Let's loot.  Thank you, guys.  Oh, no.  We only got one black guy.  Shit.  It's looting will stink.  Oh, Jesus.  That girl blurting out the N-word.  I like it.  Oh, boy.  Right there on the street.  We have lovely fans.  All right.  A bounce face.  Let's go back.  We got work to do.  We're going to lose these microphones.  Oh, what repulsive fans.  Happy Jimmy Day. 
[02:24:30]  Happy Jimmy Day, sir.  That's right.  You with the John Voight hairdo.  Oh, my God.  Happy Jimmy Day.  If that face didn't say Alzheimer's.  Oh, I'd love to just kick him right in his ball.  It's Jimmy Day for him every day.  Wow.  Nice dumper on the staff chair.  It's Jimmy Day.  It's Bob Day.  Yes.  It's Larry Day for that guy.  It's a lot of forgotten friends day.  It's a lot of...  Burden day, it should be.  Hold it.  It's Jimmy Day, sir.  That's right.  Raise your coffee and salute.  You Ichabod Crane-looking fuck.  You see him over there? 
[02:25:00]  The police.  The cops slowing down.  He wants to know if this is a political thing.  Yeah.  If we get arrested for Jimmy Day, I will...  How great would that be?  They're just checking it out.  All right.  They gave us the thumbs up.  NYPD, baby.  NYPD.  We love it.  They gave us the thumbs up on Jimmy Day.  Happy Jimmy Day.  Happy Jimmy Day, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy! 
[02:25:30]  Jimmy!  What lovely fans.  All right.  Monster ring!  Monster ring!  Monster ring!  Monster ring!  Monster ring!  Cops are all looking at it, making sure it's okay.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Well, somehow...  We're going to go inside.  Guys, we'll have you guys up in shifts.  Because, I mean, they came all...  You know, they came from far away.  All these people at one time coming up would be a little much for our...  You guys, we're going to organize this and have you guys come up in shifts, like five, 
[02:26:00]  six at a time.  All right?  Yeah.  I think we know who's coming up first.  Half of the shifts come up first to flash their moves.  Don't be mean like that.  I'm not being mean.  I just know how the people pick, and I know which girls are coming up first.  That's right.  I don't pick.  Look, I'm fat smashing as fast as I can.  You look good.  Did I say anything?  They're going to bring everybody up in shifts, because there's just too many people at once.  Hello, everybody.  It's Jimmy Day.  We love him.  Thank you, miss.  Nurse Heather from PalTalk. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, hi.  See?  Oh, look at that.  Nurse Heather.  I'm meeting a celebrity there.  All right.  All right.  All right, everybody.  Thank you, guys.  We'll see you guys upstairs.  We're going to have some of you guys come up in a little bit.  We hope you're happy to hear that.  Sword of Jimmy Day continues in moments.  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites  to fight the forces of evil.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my sweet.  Jeez.  With a cop.  I want to be known as notorious.  No.  Act, act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like poorly spliced.  Oh, it's hilarious.  You ever see if yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it excites.  Pauketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can. 
[02:27:30]  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Those, quietly and anonymously, continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just mixed.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Ooh.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What the hell is this? 
[02:28:00]  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Where's my mic?  Am I on?  Ow, my headphones.  Ow.  I just turned them up. 
[02:28:30]  Hi, everybody.  This is part two of the way the Wackbag people like to think of it.  The lackluster, biding our time, not doing shit portion of the show.  Go fuck yourselves.  Tired of it.  Argued like an idiot last night on, um, on Wackbag.  Just cursing people out.  And then I get a phone call from Jimmy.  He's in another thread, also cursing people out.  And we realize, we're talking to each other, we go, why do we bother? 
[02:29:00]  Why are we two fucking retards typing curse words?  I actually typed to one guy, I said, shut the fuck up, or I will buy your mother and fuck  her in her asshole.  You're romantic.  Yeah.  Hopeless.  They drove me to it.  And then other people go, well, Anthony, why do you bother?  Why do you even care?  And I sit there and go, you know, this person's totally right.  I shouldn't give a shit.  I shouldn't care. 
[02:29:30]  And right when I'm at the point where I'm not going to answer anymore, Jimmy calls me  up and says that he's on a thread, like two threads down, doing the same thing I'm doing.  Reading, getting annoyed, posting curse words.  You just don't want to read.  You want to be like Kevin Smith.  Kevin Smith said he made his own website.  He charges money, like $2 to register, which is nothing, but it's enough to keep, like,  a lot of the riffraff out.  And it's so much easier.  That way. 
[02:30:00]  But we just feel compelled to log on and look and say maybe today.  Maybe today.  This is waterproof?  Yeah.  Waterproof?  Wait, do we get to keep these?  Yeah.  Fucking.  Wow.  Is this somehow Anthony and Opie got included in Jimmy Day?  Yes.  XM.  Thank God.  Those are from Eric.  Are you kidding?  This is awesome.  Fucking XM's technology, man.  God damn it.  So what is the XM?  What is it called officially?  The XM Boombox?  It's called the XM Jimmy.  What's the official name of this? 
[02:30:30]  This is a cool product.  Didn't it say it?  XM Audio System.  Ben says it's waterproof, too.  It's waterproof, too.  Audio system.  The perfect companion for your Delphi Rode XT or Audiovox Express.  Wow.  XM Satellite Receivers.  It's a white boombox, basically.  Oh, and then...  What a really hip design.  A Rode XT fits right inside it.  It looks almost like one of those things you get for an iPod.  It's got that same vibe to it.  Exactly.  It's white.  It's really, really cool, man.  Yeah, because you can, like... 
[02:31:00]  Look.  You pop it out.  Yeah.  You pop out your Rode XT.  You can pop it back in there.  And you can bring this to the beach or to a sodomy.  You can bring this anywhere you want.  This is really great, man.  It's like a ghetto blaster.  Yeah.  It's like the 80s ghetto blaster.  Thank you, Elo and XM.  Wow.  Really nice.  Guys, hopefully the rain will stop long enough so that you can go outside and empty them  or enjoy them.  Jeez.  I got it from a needle.  Enjoy them.  The units are all activated and ready to go.  This boombox is the newest out for the Rode XT and Express. 
[02:31:30]  The radio is already in there for you.  Have a great weekend.  Elo and Hojo.  Who's Hojo?  Or Hoju?  Who is it?  Hoju.  H-O-J-U?  Oh, Hugo.  Hugo.  Hugo.  Hugo.  Hugo with a J?  I don't know.  Is it probably a G poorly written?  The units are all activated and ready to go.  This boombox is the...  Sorry, I just turned mine up and I'm micing it.  Express, the radio is already in there for you.  Listen to how good it sounds.  Wow.  Elo and Hojo? 
[02:32:00]  Who's Hojo?  Or Hoju?  H-O-J-U?  Oh, Hugo.  Hugo.  Hugo.  Hugo with a J?  I don't know.  Is it probably a G poorly written?  The units are all activated and ready to go.  This boombox is...  Sorry, I just turned mine up and I'm micing it.  It's going to be an endless loop.  We can do that all day.  We can just sit here and let it play over and over again.  No, we can't get out of it.  No.  No, no, no. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, Hugo.  Hugo.  Hugo.  Hugo with a J?  I just held the mic up to the speaker.  Gee, poorly written.  The units are all activated and ready to go.  This boombox is...  Sorry, I just turned mine up.  Why do you mean you can't keep going?  No.  I am so confused.  No.  Anyway, and then it says, good luck tonight, Jimmy, with your DVD signing, E.  Thank you, Eric.  As in E-lo.  That is very, very cool, man.  That is very cool.  It's amazing.  When you mentioned WackBank, we were both getting into it on different threads. 
[02:33:00]  But one of the guys was like, yeah, man, when you start yelling at E-lo, it's like,  you dope.  Yell at E-lo.  E-lo's the one guy I wouldn't yell at, A, because he could fire me on the spot, but  B, he's my friend.  It was like, E-lo, I fucking love.  And he gets things done.  Yes.  You know what I looked at right before we walked over to do this show?  Jimmy's penis.  That's right.  And then I downloaded from my email.  Well, a little back history.  As you know, we've been bitching a lot this week because there's a lot of frustration  that comes out.  And, you know, I mean, that's what makes this show good on so many levels that we have 
[02:33:30]  no problem, you know, showing you the ugly side of this program.  Very open.  Whatever you're hearing on this show is what's going on in real life.  So we talk about it.  And we were very frustrated because it's been about 20 months that we've been here and we  haven't been part of a national TV spot.  And that was one of the things that was promised to us the day we sat down and, you know, thought  about signing with XM.  So, you know, and they pretty much at that time did promise that we would be in a national 
[02:34:00]  TV spot.  And we don't want a commercial centered around Opie and Anthony.  It was never what we were asking for.  It's just we want to be part of XM, part of what XM is proud of as their programming and  have that shown on a commercial.  Right.  So and then coincidentally, which made this really very interesting because obviously we have  two bosses now.  We're on commercial radio and we're still on XM, right?  And XM being the big boss, they're the ones that own us.  We like to call them divorce mommy and divorce daddy. 
[02:34:30]  So I swear to you, this had nothing to do with the two.  But then two days ago, Tom Chiasano, after our commercial radio show, goes, guys, can I  meet with you guys tomorrow after you're done with the radio show?  Because we want to discuss a TV spot, a national TV spot saying you're back on commercial radio.  Right.  And now that kind of...  Hold on.  We're in the middle of this.  You have horrendous time.  Oh, my God.  Even on TV.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Whose bad timing is this? 
[02:35:00]  Oh, my God.  We're in the middle of discussing something.  Could you roll out the oversized cake for a minute?  Just for a minute.  Holy crap.  One second.  We're trying to make a point.  Does anyone...  Why would anyone listen to the show?  Why?  Why would they?  Just for a second.  Just for a second.  Roll out the oversized cake, please.  Just for a second.  Oh, my God.  This is just...  Just everyone be patient.  Oh, my God.  I know everyone's excited because it's Jimmy Day.  We're just getting to something that's really cool.  You know, if it was just...  If it was Twitchels and Big A, yeah, interrupt. 
[02:35:30]  Whatever.  Who cares?  If we're blabbing about something just to fill time like we usually do on this side of the show,  then fine.  But we actually have something to say.  So then Tom Chiasano says, yeah, we want to discuss a TV spot, a national TV spot saying  you're back on commercial radio.  Yeah.  And, you know, that kind of made XM look bad.  Let's be honest.  So this morning, I get a phone call and we get emails from Elo.  And he just casually...  He casually writes.  You want me to read this?  Yeah.  Because it's really funny.  Because we all know where this came from, but I guess we're not going to acknowledge 
[02:36:00]  it.  We'll make believe that this was in the works.  That it was just in the works and it happened.  Elo, we'll make believe that this was in the works.  Okay?  We'll give you the benefit of that, although we just told the million people that we're on  to you.  Guys, look at this TV spot that we are running on network TV starting this weekend through  next week.  There are a few other changes that we have, but we're about 90% of the way there.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is why we bitch on this show.  And that's why you've got to understand this on Whackbag and all the other fan sites.  We get things done through our bitching. 
[02:36:30]  And Opie and Anthony will be featured in the XM National TV commercial that starts up this  weekend for Father's Day.  I was emailed the commercial.  They're doing a big Father's Day promotion and we're going to be part of it.  I was emailed the commercial and I saw it.  And yes, we are indeed part of it.  It's a whole montage of personalities done in slideshow format where a picture of somebody  like Bob Dylan will be on screen and it'll slowly kind of move toward the, you know, 
[02:37:00]  like it's a zoom in on the photograph with the XM logo and the name underneath.  And then one of those that come up is the Opie and Anthony show.  It says Opie and Anthony.  It's our pictures.  And we're, you know, kind of moving slowly in with the slideshow picture thing.  And then it goes on to another personality, Ludacris.  Show him.  But we're part of the commercial.  We're part of it.  It's all we ever wanted.  And Elo, he'll probably call up and say no is in the works.  But, I mean, I really do believe with all my heart that we bitched so much that they 
[02:37:30]  said, all right, just throw up their pictures up on this commercial to shut them up.  So they go back to doing funny radio.  We're pitting divorced mommy and divorced daddy against each other.  And they're both giving us brand new bicycles and nice stuff.  Look, we just got all three.  We didn't even make a peep.  And we got three great radios all activated and running.  So it's great.  So we looked at the commercial.  It looks great.  Can we get it up on the website, opieandanthony.com? 
[02:38:00]  I would check with Elo first because it's probably a thing where they want it to air on TV first.  Really?  If it's a national commercial thing.  Well, let's find out.  All right.  Well, then maybe by Monday or something we'll have the finished product because I think we  saw like a version they're still working on.  90%.  I bet the 10% that isn't done is removing us from it.  The editing of the opie and Anthony Robinson.  Putting in Bob Edwards' photo.  Yeah.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  This is what's going to be interesting.  And Elo, he has no problem playing with us. 
[02:38:30]  He obviously had to get rid of somebody to make us happy because he's had it with our  pitching.  I want to know who got cut to get our stupid faces on the commercial.  Is Ellen in it?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  We'll probably find out like Monday or Tuesday after the spot runs a while.  All right.  Finally, can we bring in the oversized cake?  Yeah.  Bring in the cake.  I wonder what this cake is about.  This cake doesn't look edible, by the way.  It's about six feet tall.  You're having a tough time rolling it.  I'll never finish it.  Yeah.  It almost fell over like three times. 
[02:39:00]  It's my fault on the bad timing.  And who gets credit for the cake?  I believe Bam.  Bam, right?  Yes.  General Bam.  FullblownAids.com.  FullblownAids.com.  Doug out Doug and Uncle Inky and Bam.  FullblownAids.com.  Look at these girls.  Got the oversized cake for old Jimmy Norris.  Holy Toledo, they're lovely.  All right.  Wait.  There's a photo op.  Get over here, former child star.  You've got to get a good angle, man.  Yeah, sweetie.  And, uh-oh, wait.  The top of the cake seems to be removable.  Yes, it is.  I thought we were all going to have a slice of cake. 
[02:39:30]  I can't eat that?  There could be something in there.  Oh, Jimmy, you can eat it.  Wait.  Wait.  Why don't we get the PalTalk camera set up perfectly for everybody at home?  There you go.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's funny.  Whatever's inside really needs to get out.  Yeah.  The cake has cerebral palsy.  What are you doing?  They can see.  The curtains are coming down.  Can they see?  Yeah.  I think we should leave it open right now.  Open it up.  Open it up for them.  Open it up.  Open it up.  Open it up.  All right.  That's just the legal thing.  We've got a lot of listeners outside. 
[02:40:00]  They're coming up in shifts to check out the show a little bit today.  Oh, I think I saw a hand.  Wow.  There could be someone in there.  Where?  In the cake?  No.  That's food.  It can't be food.  Jimmy, we got you a little surprise knowing what you love.  Cake all right.  Ice cream cake?  I don't think it's that little.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Wait, get up my cat.  Oh, the humanity.  Hello, miss.  Happy sort of Jimmy day.  Oh, thank you, miss.  She's lovely. 
[02:40:30]  Wow.  She's a big gal.  She's a tall girl.  How tall are you?  How tall are you, ma'am?  With or without heels?  Huh?  With or without heels?  Both, I guess.  6'2 without.  6'2 without?  Without heels.  And wow, your shoulders are very broad, too.  Oh, you're a tall girl.  Do you model?  I've been working out.  Wait, get the mic up to here.  You've been working out?  Yes, I have been working out.  Yeah, make sure she doesn't fall and hurt herself. 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  I didn't sign it yet.  You've got some big feet.  Lady, whoa.  What a view.  Boy.  Well, that is fantastic.  You're wearing an FBA shirt and, oh, geez, FBA thong.  But for some reason, it doesn't look like it does on the other girls.  Yeah, there's something.  There's something.  Is there another Jimmy Day present stuck in the front of your thong?  There's a lot stuck there.  I think so.  Wow. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, no.  Look at what Jimmy got.  It is a national holiday.  Yes.  Well, I heard it was sort of Jimmy Day.  Kind of, yeah.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Just rub them, no pinch.  So what's your name?  Rebecca.  That's good.  Rebecca is your name.  Hi, Rebecca.  Rebecca.  Wow.  There's a girl pinching Jimmy's nipples.  She certainly is.  And another girl behind that girl pinching her nipples.  It's like a nipple-pinching chain going on.  It's like a party of just nipple rubbing.  Yes.  It's like a nipple-pinching centipede. 
[02:42:00]  Look how he's moved his leg.  Oh, and now a little massage for Jimmy Day.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Let's go back to Bam.  Happy birthday.  It's just Jimmy Day.  And whenever you want to close the blinds, the ladies are willing to actually do something  this time.  All right.  Close the fucking blinds.  Fuck the audience.  I'm going down.  Where are these girls from, General Bam?  They are from-  Centerfoldstrips.com.  Yeah.  Centerfoldstrips.com.  They provide us with a cake and the girls.  Just want to thank them.  Centerfoldstrips.com.  What is Centerfoldstrips.com?  It's like a national strip company. 
[02:42:30]  They send strippers out.  They do private parties and events.  Yeah.  Private parties.  Bachelor parties.  Anything you need like that.  Boys parties.  Jimmy Day parties.  Okay.  Jimmy Day parties.  They do all kinds of parties.  And surprisingly reliable and keeping their word.  And you know something?  I got to tell you.  A lot of these generals that we've read about in the paper with Zarkawi being killed think  they pulled off a coup.  General Bam.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  General.  Thank you.  Who gets the job done.  Yes.  Yes, we do. 
[02:43:00]  Bring in the liberator.  Yes.  And bring in the drill dough.  And I think.  Oh, wow.  I think Rebecca has a J-Damn bomb underneath the skirt.  I'm moving away for that.  Wow.  Is this actually going to happen?  A drill dough?  Holy metal.  Yes, it is.  It's going to be used on this very program?  Yes, it is.  Fantastic.  Jimmy, what's going on over there?  I'm getting hugs from some lovely girls.  She's whispering in your ear and a little nuzzling. 
[02:43:30]  She is.  And wow.  And you're rubbing a little bottom?  Yeah.  Oh, she just slapped her ass.  It's a lovely one, too.  I might add.  Jimmy's been rubbing it.  It's a pretty one.  It certainly is.  It's a little bit mighty.  It's like a little Filipino boy's bottom.  Oh.  I mean, it's nice.  Excuse me.  Forgive me.  That's a compliment, believe it or not.  Very nice.  These girls are great.  They have brought the liberator in for Jimmy Day or sort of Jimmy Day.  You know, I've got to tell you, what a welcome change from just a couple of days ago when 
[02:44:00]  we had a girl from Penthouse in here who wouldn't even show off anything.  She was like a fucking Quaker.  She wouldn't show anything.  Oh, hey, look at that, Jimmy.  She has a happy Jimmy Day.  They are lovely nipples.  I have to be honest.  I grew them myself.  They really are.  They're very big.  She grew them herself.  They're even funny.  They're big and juicy.  She grew up next to her.  I like them.  I'm restraining because it's all about Jimmy today.  It's just about Jimmy.  I'm not blowing up anyone's stuff today.  They want to know if they can take off their clothes. 
[02:44:30]  It's up to Jimmy.  It's Jimmy's day.  Jimmy, they want to know if they can take off their clothes.  Yeah.  Not that I want that, but I'm thinking of everyone else.  Yeah.  Did you see him check that out before he said yes?  I have to tinkle.  Can I tinkle?  Oh, Jesus.  Your timing is awful.  I got to tinkle.  I got to let him tinkle.  Your fucking timing.  I have to tinkle.  I can't help it.  I can't let him tinkle.  Thank you. 
[02:45:00]  I'll be right back.  If you don't hurry.  But Jimmy.  Un-fucking-believable.  Jimmy.  I have to pee.  Unbelievable.  I have to pee.  But Jimmy.  Do we have a stunt Jimmy anywhere around here?  I have this horrible feeling I'm not going to get a smoothie today.  Yeah.  What happened to our smoothies?  No smoothies?  No.  Kenny wants to watch.  No.  No.  I'm a married man.  I don't contone this activity.  Oh, is that it?  Can my wife hear that?  Kenny couldn't get to the mic fast enough to make sure his wife knows that he's too busy getting smoothies to see the action in studio today. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  I'll be running errands.  Yes.  A smoothie.  I will help you out today.  You can even call from a cell phone on the street so your wife definitely knows that you weren't in here for the action.  She knows I'm a professional.  But while you're walking with the smoothie, I don't want to wait.  Okay.  I'm an important man.  Anybody else GH smoothie?  No, thank you, Kenny.  No, thank you.  Anybody, Elmo?  No.  No, thanks. 
[02:46:00]  Is Jimmy almost back or should we break?  You never spend this much time asking.  Jimmy's going to get a smoothie somewhere else.  Yeah, we understand.  Why are you waiting in here still, Kenny?  Waiting to see if Jimmy wants a smoothie?  The girls are just smacking each other on the ass while they...  Why don't you...  You know something?  I think Jimmy would probably like it if you girls were naked when he came in.  You know that scene in Pulp Fiction when Uma Thurman comes back and goes,  Don't you love when you come back and your food is waiting for you?  That's kind of it.  Jimmy gets back from his piss. 
[02:46:30]  You girls are already totally naked.  Can we get over there?  Huh?  No, this section here is sectioned off.  Yeah, yeah.  This is an actual zone of no...  I'll climb right over this table and get...  No, no, no, no.  There's a zone of nothingness that happens back here.  I'm actually a flaming, flaming homosexual.  I actually have a question for you.  It's called a forbidden zone.  But you know what?  There's a girl who's my roommate who says she knows you and says that you're not a homosexual.  Well, she's lying. 
[02:47:00]  Really?  Yeah, I'm flaming.  Serena?  Do you know Serena?  Serena?  I've never heard of a Serena.  Really?  I have a note for you.  You have a note for me from Serena?  She said he was so nice.  Is she a MySpace friend?  No, she's a Dix Hills friend.  Dix Hills?  I don't know a Serena.  No?  I'll give you the note later.  Maybe I'll remember.  Give me the note.  I'll read it right now.  I need my dad, Danny.  Give me the note.  I'll read it on the air.  Because I don't really...  I don't know a Serena.  I've never...  These girls are lovely.  You know a Serena?  Oh, there he is. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  I need to pass up again in this chair, please.  All right.  How come you're so quiet?  Oh, mighty, Ben.  Should I move my headphone thing?  There they go.  The top is off.  One girl's got her top off.  Yeah, this guy talks.  Yeah, so they're going to sit down on the chair.  There's a drill dough that's going to be involved.  How come you're so quiet?  We're going to have to get the union involved to work the old drill dough.  I know, the drill dough.  It's a union job.  It's a union job is right.  Where should I sit?  I sit in the chair.  Oh, it is chair. 
[02:48:00]  Jimmy is...  I think we need more microphones over in that area.  What's going on?  Why would there be?  Why?  Like I said, I'm not blowing up anyone's spot today.  I'm just back in...  It's Jimmy's day.  And letting Jimmy have his almost Jimmy day.  And get the...  Jesus Christ.  Is it the Hubble telescope or the PalTalk camera?  Can we put it as close as we can possibly get it to the action?  It looks like a...  Yeah, right on the edge of the console there.  As close as it can go without getting knocked off of there. 
[02:48:30]  There we go.  Because that's what the people want to see.  What's going on, Jimmy?  If you ask me how I feel, the answer is lovely.  Yeah.  Fucking bam and the listeners.  Just unbelievable.  They got girls in here.  Whoa.  The girl is now upside down.  That's a reverse 69 that she is doing.  Jimmy is sitting in a chair.  She has her snatch right in his face.  Holy mackerel.  Wow.  Did you get a little...  Nice.  Yeah.  You like...  She did like a handstand and she put her private area right on my chin. 
[02:49:00]  Private area.  Like it was a fantastic football.  Where the fuck do you think you are?  Her snatch, Jimmy.  Oh, wow.  She's going to get paralyzed.  Now it's a full 69.  It's a full chair born 69.  Oh, I love it.  Don't break his neck.  Yeah, he's going to break his neck on sort of Jimmy Day.  Jimmy, don't you wish a car company would put on an airbag like that?  You'd just be crashing into trees.  Hold on.  Let me take the headphones off.  The headphones are cock-walking. 
[02:49:30]  Jimmy's getting choked.  I had to say...  I never saw a neck bend like that before.  I think you didn't say penis.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  Now this girl is putting her leg...  She's doing a reverse.  Like when you do chicken fights and a girl gets on your back.  She's doing that only on the front of Jimmy.  Holy mackerel.  Now Jimmy's got her legs spread right in front of him.  She has a whole private area.  You like that?  Is it puffy like you like it?  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Oh, another girl.  The other girl losing the top and the bra's got to come off. 
[02:50:00]  And then all the panties are coming down, Jimmy.  Uh-oh.  Totally shaved just like Jimmy likes it.  Oh, I'm relaxed.  I'm very relaxed.  Just like Jimmy likes it.  Jimmy's getting smothered right now.  Oh.  I'm going to have to give you a birthday hat.  I like birthday hats.  Oh, look.  A bra is being put on Jimmy's head.  Birthday hats are fun.  Jimmy's got a black bra strapped to his head like a little birthday hat with two homes on it.  Oh, birthday hats are fun.  You're not annoyed. 
[02:50:30]  He looks like an idiot.  Wow, she's totally shaved.  Oh, that's a lovely one.  She's taking her bottoms completely off now in front of Jimmy.  Her ass is red.  She's been getting spanked.  Well, now she's putting Jimmy's...  She's putting her panties over Jimmy's jeans.  But he's got a C.  Oh, do you look like an idiot?  I feel like I'm wearing Aquaman's mask.  You look like a panda bear.  Oh, I'm wearing, look, a full-blown AIDS... 
[02:51:00]  Oh, I wish you would have told me.  I would have fucking...  All right, great.  It goes with your disease.  And now girls in front of Jimmy...  Girls are climbing on Jimmy.  Ow, that's got to hurt.  Jimmy's going to need a massage.  Jimmy's going to break something.  My shoulders are hurting.  Something's going to get...  Yeah, don't hurt Jimmy's shoulders.  There we go.  Sauté at the car on Jimmy.  Hold it hard.  They're climbing all over him.  My God, they're going to hurt our little boy.  His face is all red. 
[02:51:30]  Slipped out.  Who's looking?  All right.  Well, one girl is completely naked.  She is now climbing on Jimmy and hurting him.  There's some pleasure with the pain.  Oh, my God.  She's grinding into Jimmy's head.  Yeah, there's a vagina right on his nose.  Who knew that they were strippers and gymnasts?  Oh, the other girl's panties are totally coming off now.  Yep.  Wow.  Jimmy, I guess she's got one that you kind of like.  I see a little action.  Oh, it's fucking fantastic.  A little? 
[02:52:00]  What's going on?  It's just fantastic.  It's like hubba-bubba.  Oh, I love it.  It's wonderful.  I'm going to have to ask you to open your mouth and bite it.  Oh, there's a little...  Now that she's using the thong like a horse bit.  It's like I'm in an Alvarkawi video.  It looks like the girls have done this before, huh?  They got a whole thing they do, a whole routine.  They are lovely girls.  Mm-hmm.  She is in blowjob position.  I know.  In front of Jimmy.  She certainly is.  And now, oh, she's through the pants. 
[02:52:30]  You know what Jimmy likes?  What does Jimmy like?  When you breathe hot air through his pants so he can feel it on his cock.  Because we were just doing that last night.  Can I feel you up?  Mm-hmm.  This is so nice.  We have to pierce it later.  Don't pinch it.  Just touch it lightly.  Oh.  It's Jimmy Day.  Jimmy likes his nipples touched lightly.  Do it right.  Sort of Jimmy Day.  No pinching.  No pinching. 
[02:53:00]  It's the birthday boy's birthday.  All right.  All right.  Now Jimmy's on the liberator.  Jimmy's on the liberator.  You might want to turn the pal talk camera to the action.  There you go.  How's the voice?  Very nice.  Jimmy, what's going on over there?  Well, one girl was...  Hold on.  One girl was the only...  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's getting smothered right now.  Is this safe?  It's so funny.  Jimmy won't let me take his shirt off, but his belt and pants are coming.  I have a vagina in my face.  And now I have an ass on my nose. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, they're smothered.  Oh, don't be so violent.  Jim's going to need a chiropractor after this.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Okay.  Tomorrow's opiate Sunday.  All right.  Jimmy, what's going on?  You having fun over there, pal?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah?  Wow.  She has a nice vagina.  Look at Jimmy's dog.  He was really nice.  Nobody gets hurt.  Oh, where are we going?  All right.  They're just taking turns smothering Jimmy's face. 
[02:54:00]  Jimmy?  Can he talk?  Jimmy's so sweet right now.  He's such a nice guy.  Can Jimmy talk?  I think he's sweet.  I think he's dead.  Oh, my God.  The neck is around his neck.  The neck is around his neck.  The belt is around his neck.  Holy shit.  Do I like that?  Wow.  The neck of the vagina.  Jimmy, explain what's going on.  There's a really plump vagina by my face.  And there's another girl's mouth by my face.  And they're getting along nicely.  I'm licking her pussy right in front of Jimmy's face. 
[02:54:30]  That's one way to put it.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, protect your neck.  I need one of those neck collars.  I got actual gum in there.  Is that it is measured?  I think it's going to work like a dental dam, I think.  Wait, what's in there?  Gum.  Gum?  I thought it was a dental dam.  It's gum.  Uh-oh.  Oh, gum.  What's wrong?  Troubles a-brewin'.  What?  What's the matter? 
[02:55:00]  What happened?  Something came up.  Roll over.  Oh, my God.  You have a bigger one?  She's got a drill, though, and she told Jimmy to roll over.  All right.  Oh, my God.  When's the big fella get involved?  I really like the vagina in my face.  Thank you.  It's lovely.  Thank you.  You like the vagina in your face?  I do.  I do.  Oh, thank you.  That's lovely.  Jimmy, they fucking rule.  We should have five of these a week. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, hi.  Jimmy, how are you now?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Jimmy, try to talk while you're in that position.  Fuck.  Opie, they have a midget for you if you want it next time.  A midget?  A midget.  Yes.  I'm short, though.  I'm not a big midget.  All right?  All right.  No, we're talking about the video.  That's my ass, Jimmy.  Do you like it?  I certainly do.  It's right on your chin.  I know.  Wow. 
[02:56:00]  Jimmy's face is being used like toilet paper.  I know.  I know.  These girls, they're the best girls we've had in the studio.  Oh, thank you, miss.  All right.  They're taking turns now.  Wow.  They are all over Jimmy.  They're switching positions.  It's Jimmy Day.  Steve, get your big head out of the way of the action.  Sorry.  Steve's blocking the pal talk camera.  Steve, move your head.  Shut up.  All right.  Yeah, they're all checking this out on the pal talk.  Oh, that's meaty.  Can you move it over?  Oh, look at that pussy.  You want that, don't you, Jimmy? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, I joke.  Yeah, you do.  It's a fucking gem.  How bad do you want it, Jimmy?  How bad?  I know you want it, Jimmy.  How bad do you want it?  That much?  I just want to kiss it.  Really, Jimmy, it's that much?  It's lovely.  No, not that much.  No.  Oh, my God.  All right.  She's rolling over on Jimmy.  There she goes.  Oh, there's more ass in your face, Jimmy.  Get the mic on, Jimmy.  Get the mic on, Jimmy.  He likes it.  He likes it.  He likes it.  He likes it. 
[02:57:00]  I'm sorry, but I'll kiss my ass.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I will.  Oh, I feel so naughty.  You are so naughty, Jimmy.  Yes.  These girls are the fucking greatest.  Holy shit.  Centerfoldstrips.com, baby.  Centerfoldstrips.com.  That's right.  I'll plug you till the cows come home.  I'm Natalie.  That's me.  I'm not.  Screw Lucky Louie.  I say Lucky Jimmy.  Lucky Jimmy.  Lucky Jimmy. 
[02:57:30]  Let's hear him off the mic.  Oh, Natalie is a good girl.  Natalie makes me happy.  Very naughty girl.  I'll say she is.  But we love that about her.  Oh, fuck.  We love that about her.  Look at this.  Now a girl straddling Jimmy.  I like to stall him.  Straddling Jimmy and grinding on him.  And the other girl is sitting up by his head, just kind of rubbing his head and shoulders.  A third girl has entered the scene, Anthony.  What?  A third girl has entered.  Where the hell did she come from?  Where did she come from?  I'm going to go this way. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  All right.  They're completely smothering Jimmy.  Wow.  Jimmy?  Oh, my goodness.  Jimmy, describe the action for everybody.  Okay.  There's a pussy in my face, one on my dick, and one on my head.  That's some great color commentary.  I feel like a rapper.  A rapper.  Jimmy, are you bummed that the big fella's not in the action? 
[02:58:30]  He can't even talk.  That's what it sounds like when you try to talk with a pussy in your face.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, I'm so happy.  Jimmy sounds like he has a cold.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I like this nail trail.  It's like a human breatherite strip.  Oh, wow.  The girls are going to get off with him, and his face is going to look like Alzar Cowie's  after the bombing.  Holy shit. 
[02:59:00]  Why is that time?  I hope not.  Oh, my God.  Oh, for his sake.  Oh, the panties are coming off of girl number three.  Yeah.  I don't care about names at this point.  It's just all about girl number one, two, three.  It looks like somebody dropped a bag of roast beef sandwiches.  Another nice one.  Oh, really?  Is that what we got going over there?  Do they deserve to be called by their names?  No, they're just numbers.  They're just numbers.  Jimmy, this is, you know, probably...  These girls are so fantastic. 
[02:59:30]  It's kind of nice in here.  See, Jimmy hasn't seen this kind of action in this studio.  Right.  Usually when we had a wiffle ball bat challenge and things like that, he was out in California.  That's right.  He missed it.  This is the first time.  This is all about Jimmy.  All about...  What is that girl doing?  Jerking him off?  No, she was just tickling.  All I saw was her hand moving.  She just...  She tickled it a bit and I giggled.  I was checking.  She checked it and I was happy she did.  Oh, God.  Hi.  These girls are fucking professionals. 
[03:00:00]  Is it playing time yet?  Oh, my God.  Well, do you girls have a grand finale?  What time, ladies?  We're not...  Hey.  What is it?  Finale?  Can we break out the wiffle ball bat?  What's that thing called?  This is called a microphone.  No, no, no.  The penis on the drill.  Oh, the penis.  The drill dough.  Drill dough.  Oh, I thought it was like, you know, eliminated.  Jesus.  He looks...  She looks like she's had some familiarity with power tools.  By the way, yeah.  Huh?  Let's try this then.  Oh, pinch softly. 
[03:00:30]  You know what?  I'm going to teach you to like it, John.  Thank you.  You're going to see that you really like it.  Thank you.  All right.  They're still...  Not bad.  They're riding over Jimmy.  Working him over.  To say the least.  No.  No.  No.  Let me get my pants off first.  They try to work the drill dough on Jimmy, and Jimmy said, no, no.  Let me get my pants off first.  All right.  What's going on over there, Jimmy?  A credible piece of machinery, and what it is is...  Jimmy is...  It's a dildo.  You can't do that unless you put on a policeman's uniform. 
[03:01:00]  I got one right here.  Jimmy is down.  Jimmy is down.  No, Jimmy's up.  He's all right.  No.  Oh, there you have it.  You see it in there?  What's in there?  It's conquering for...  What's that?  It's like a what?  You see it in there.  What's in there?  Take it out.  What the hell are they looking at?  I have to look at the pal-to camera to see what's going on.  They're looking at his thing, I guess, and his thingy.  This area here. 
[03:01:30]  A baby's bottom.  What are they sucking on?  They say it's like a baby's bottom, but it smells like that for a reason.  Oh, my God.  I haven't sniffed you at all.  It's clean.  Well, there you have it.  It's clean.  It smells like absolutely nothing.  I'm staying.  It's an ultra-fuck.  Jesus.  There's a lot of self-control.  Oh.  It's very impressive.  Wow.  Now she's...  I think it's that this guy is too close to his penis, honestly.  One of the girls are riding Jimmy through his pants, just rocking back and forth. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, Jimmy, you filling up?  What's that?  A little bit, surprisingly, it was hard until I started looking at Big Kevin Barrett.  Oh, gee, what happened?  All of a sudden, his sound went out.  I want to check that microphone.  Or we might want to check his mouth.  Oh, he's got tits in his face.  That's right.  Mars, no need to be in here.  Oh, I hope you're getting a phone call.  I swear it's cherry flavor. 
[03:02:30]  Is this E-Rock?  I don't know, but it's amazing.  Take the call up.  Hello.  I'm just going to have to check one more time.  Go ahead.  What's going on?  Oh, look, it's your smoothie.  Oh.  Oh, smoothie's here.  It's Jimmy Day.  Thank you.  I'll have him call you.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  I'm kidding me.  Jesus.  I love him in the she-string, by the way.  I think he looks great.  Oh, that's a good smoothie. 
[03:03:00]  I need to know right now.  What?  Who is going to partake in the double-down with me?  Well, I'll tell you who's out.  Rebecca there just...  Rebecca?  Rebecca just held her hand up.  She raised her hand.  What a great hiney.  It's a team effort.  Well, I think you've got three candidates there.  I'm so sorry.  I'm just going to come in here as long.  Whoa, she's deep-throating that dildo.  Wow.  God.  Wow. 
[03:03:30]  You're really good at that.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen anything quite like it, ladies and gentlemen.  That cop should have a Knicks jersey here.  What a blowjob.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you want the dildo up your ass, or...  Come on, Jimmy.  What do you want?  I got a strap-on, too, baby.  And I know how to work it.  That really was nice watching you put that in your mouth, miss.  You like that?  I certainly did.  Yeah, get that camera up.  I don't know.  No one told me your name.  What is my name, Jimmy?  What is your name?  What's my name, bitch?  Woman I would gladly give a lot of money to. 
[03:04:00]  She is Rio.  I am Natalie.  Hi, Rio.  And this is Janela.  Janela.  Janela.  Oh.  You guys can just do the rest of the show.  No need to pay attention to me.  Yeah, well...  It is the rest of the show.  All right, you ready?  What's going on with the double dung?  There it is.  There you have it.  Here we go.  Wait, get that on video.  Take that down.  How big is that?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How much is that? 
[03:04:30]  It's just too much is what it is, really.  How long is that?  That is a lot.  Eyes water.  That made her eyes water.  It did.  Jesus.  It did a little.  You took a lot of that cock.  I thought it was going to come out the other end.  Yeah, that would be a treat.  I'm hoping, you know, that would really save me a lot of time and trouble.  Well, well, girls, you're going to partake in the drill dough or the double dung dildo?  What's it going to be?  I'm going to actually be in charge of the drilling.  Oh, wow. 
[03:05:00]  That was good.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Would you bash your head on your television?  Her IQ just went up three points.  Oh, I knew what you were going for.  I can't even do that with that.  All right.  The cock fell off the drill dough.  Come on.  No way.  That's all right.  Just put a drill bit on it.  All right.  I need a condom for the drill dough because I don't want her to get pregnant.  Well. 
[03:05:30]  Good to see you here for your humor.  Here we go.  Why are you putting a condom on the drill dough?  It's going to spin right off.  It's killing me how restrained I am right now.  I certainly do.  Can you help me with my penis?  Which part?  Like the fact she needs an ass bleaching?  Badly.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Here comes trouble.  I can't get it.  I'm going to get into your vagina when it's over there like that.  The chick. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  I don't care how many want to.  Yeah, there's some asshole brownness that is spreading.  It's covering an ass cheek.  She's going to put a drill dough right over my face.  Just don't let that fall off and hit me in the eye.  All right.  I'll try.  I can lose an eye this way.  Don't hurt Jimmy.  He's a big star.  Don't hurt Jimmy.  Have you seen this thing?  It's a drill dough for Christ's sake.  I know.  You're so tight.  It's retarded.  My God.  How do I know this is going to turn into body double and she's going to drill right through  me?  Are you okay?  Right through your skull. 
[03:06:30]  Now we know why she can give great blowjobs.  The girl.  I would love blowjobs.  Oh, my.  Can you mic the girl that's shitting the, uh, oh, the dildo won't turn because the,  the, I'm sorry, it's not my fault.  I'm just built that way.  Oh, she, she, that feels good.  No, you know what it is?  The, the dildo is only on there with some kind of a, uh, drill.  You can go in reverse now.  It's like a screw.  And there you have it.  Oh.  Is it serious?  The girl is tighter than like. 
[03:07:00]  That looks dangerous.  If you stick a diamond, if you stick a piece of coal in her vagina, you'll have a diamond  in two weeks.  Oh, boy.  I get it.  You don't need the drill.  Just do it manually.  I'm losing my restraint.  Yeah, fuck the drill.  Just, just stick the dildo in her.  Oh, my God.  Look at, Jimmy has got a view.  He is six or five inches away, uh, from her pussy.  She's straddling his face with a dildo going in and out. 
[03:07:30]  You're going to need to turn over so you can get a better view.  There's certainly, there's certainly, there's certainly, there's certainly, Jimmy, what do  you think?  Are you trying to?  This certainly beats, this certainly beats arguing with a critic.  I don't, yeah, strippers don't argue.  Okay.  Okay.  Tell me it's still condomed up.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Although you could have ripped that thing right off.  Is that bug bites?  Oh, goodness.  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.  We're in.  Oh, my God.  We're in.  We're live.  Where's the, I can't believe, I can't even see this live. 
[03:08:00]  I have to look at it on the pal talk camera.  Because there's too much shit going on.  No, I don't want to see it live, tell you the truth.  I'd rather watch it on TV.  Mixed disasters.  That much more distant.  Trust me.  There's less, there's less pixels on the pal talk cameras.  Oh, yeah.  Then real life smooths things out.  Real life has lots and lots of pixels.  Oh, Jimmy just got kicked in the head.  Pal talk has less pixels.  Thank God.  Did Jimmy get kicked in the head?  That's okay.  I deserved it.  What happened?  Did you get laid? 
[03:08:30]  These fucking girls are fantastic.  They're the first real deal girls we've had in this studio in a long time.  They are.  I am really fucking turned on.  Thank you.  Yes, I know.  That was a.  What's it called?  We're trying to name the skin.  No, no.  Centerfold what?  Centerfoldstrips.com.  What is it again?  Centerfold.  You know what it's called.  Centerfoldstrips.com.

Oh, please tell me Happy Typing Girl is jumping in on this.  Please.  I don't see that happening.  You are adorable.  Thank you.  You look cute.  All right.  What do we got next there, Bam?  I have a couple of gifts for Jimmy.  Oh, hold on.  Hit it.  If you want to open it.  We have a couple of gifts for Jimmy.  Okay.  Some stuff you might enjoy.  Wait.  Hold on. 
[03:09:30]  What is it?  It's something that needs to stay clean and needs to be flat.  Clean and flat.  I don't want to give it away.  Okay.  But I don't want to run the fun.  Hold on.  Clean and flat.  An Asian girl?  Nothing on that?  No.  We laughed, Jimmy.  I don't want to stop that.  That's all right.  You know what?  Just open it.  If you want to open it with me, I'll hold it with you.  I'll open it for you.  They're going to hold my gift up.  All right.  I'm actually resting my head on an asshole.  It's something you might not want to touch while doing this.  You won't have to touch it. 
[03:10:00]  Wow.  Perfect wrapping.  A girl did it.  What do you expect?  They're opening something.  I don't know what it is.  Two layers of gift wrap.  Two layers of gift wrap.

So much, guys.  Happy Jimmy Day.  Thank you, Debbie.  How big is that picture?  It's huge.  That is beautiful.  How did he pull off this fucking Jimmy Day shit?  I don't know.  It's basically a poster.  Poster size for his wall to hang up and frame. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, that is awesome.  And you didn't lose any detail either.  No.  Very nice.  Thank you for Happy Typing Girl for arranging that.  Thank you so much.  Bravo.  Happy Typing Girl.  She's in the business.  She's in the business.  She's in the business.  Last but not least, we've got a couple of T-shirts for Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.

Dear me, I hope this ends the same way it ended for him, with his head gone in a car.  Oh, no, that was good.  Where's the Stebbins Freeway sign?  All right, well.  That is the most disgusting ass I've ever seen in my life. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, can we get the skank sounds?  No, the colors.  It's like half a box of Crayola crayons.  Oh, I know.  Just all kinds of different things going on.  I'm sure it looks a lot better when you're really close.  Oh, my God.  John from Kansas is calling Jimmy old tuna head.  I could be able to walk home today.  The seagulls are going to follow.

[03:14:30]  We'll play that after the break.  How's that?  Okay.  Yeah, the instant feedbacks are hysterical.  Let me know when we're going into a break.  All right, are you going to whip it out?  No, I wouldn't do that.  Jimmy, it's almost Jimmy Day, sort of Jimmy Day, so why don't you take us to break?  But you have to do it as one of the girls smothers you.  Okay.  How about two of the girls?  Let's give them earmuffs.  Oh, I thought you would.  Okay.  What are you doing, madam?  I'm going to ask you to lift so I can remove this portion.  Oh, you're taking my G-string off?  Yeah.  Oh, I think you're taking my dick out.

Jimmy's going to take us in a break.  All right.  The girl's smothering him.  Oh, my goodness.  This is what I'm taking.  Let's go.  This is really good.  This is what I'm smothering him.

Maybe the girl with the biggest vagina so we can get some kind of echo and at least hear something.  Oh, they're lovely girls.  That was great.  You're stanking it up for us.  We're like, you can take a joke.  Jesus.  Yeah, one more time.

[03:17:00]  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  You're going to need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from the Hiv Corporation. 
[03:17:30]  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training.  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area.  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan.  Greed is good.  He'll guide you through the hiring process.  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations.  Here's what you do, stupid.  When they complain, you go, click.  You take the phone.  Click.  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations. 
[03:18:00]  You send them to training to not have those big kids showing during the workday.  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor.  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule?  And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships.  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And he'll also assist with time management.  130, Human Resources, Attempts to Talk About Sensitivity Training.  135, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor.

And you're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton.  What a fucking little guy he is.  You're checking out Sword of Jimmy Day.  Sword of?  That was full-blown Jimmy Day. 
[03:19:00]  That was full-blown Jimmy Day right there.  You're right, Anthony.  It may end with something with the same first two words, full-blown.  Jimmy, you don't have to come back in.  You do whatever you want, man.  You do whatever the hell you want today.  Oh, there's food here, too?  Yeah.  Who brought the food?  Can we touch the food or do the strippers get at it?  No, no.  I don't want to touch the clothes out there.  Oh, hey, is it free?  Let's say hi to him.  Jeff in Florida.  Jeff, what's up?  I just wanted to say, man, for you and Anthony, man, you guys are true pals, man. 
[03:19:30]  Stepping out of the spotlight, letting little Jimmy get some runs.  You guys are true pals.  It's all about Jimmy today.  Jimmy, it's the greatest gig in the world, man.  And at the comic, you get this gig, and these two guys hook me up with fucking everything.  It's just the greatest.  Yeah.  I tell you what, man.  You guys are awesome, man.  Jimmy, you rule, man.  Thank you.  Good props, man.  I'm just happy that they're both gay, so whenever strippers come in, easy.  I like on Pal Talk, a red rum is showering, and there's a happy Jimmy Day 06 on there, 
[03:20:00]  so she's taking a shower just for you.  And there's a little caricature of Jimmy in the shower with her, so you're virtually showering with her.  How fucking nice is that?  Hey, we've got to say hi to Taz, an old friend.  Stop by saying hi.  Hello, guys.  Haven't seen you in a while, man.  Yeah, I know.  I bump into you on the street here.  Yeah.  And I kind of get into this flow of this Jimmy, who are you anyway, Jimmy Norton?  No, I'm only kidding.  I'm only fucking with you.  Yeah, you know Jimmy.  I know Jimmy.  We walk out of Free FM. 
[03:20:30]  There's our old friend, Taz.  Holy shit.  Oh, today you just hanging out there?  Last time we talked to Taz, he was working for WWF.  Yeah.  That's how long ago it's been.  It has been a while, the old NEW days.  Right.  And congratulations to you guys, your transition, doing both.  Basically, you guys are on every radio station in the world, more or less, right?  Worked out just as we planned it.  Years ago, we had this whole thing planned.  What the hell is that?  Hey, it's a plane of baccala deuce.  Hey, get some of my mother.  Good God.  That looks like a little stromboli. 
[03:21:00]  Rivoli's?  Rivoli, yeah.  A what?  Rivoli's.  Rivoli's, or I always say Rivoli's.  Rivoli's, this guy is great.  He won the auction.  Yeah, he won the auction.

[03:21:30]  Let everyone get a piece.  If I see Jimmy's gained 30 pounds, I know I have a partner.  If I see some baccala deuce, I'll know I have a partner.  Did you wash your face, Jimmy?  You know what?  Oh, yeah.  Jeez, I hope so.  In a pussy.  Actually, look at it.  It is red, like you scrubbed real hard to make sure that it's not from the washing.  Dude, I was really turned on.  That was disturbing, though.  No, I'm going to tell you it was disturbing.  Wasn't it?  Those are some, I mean, you know.  They were skanky, Jimmy.  I love it.  Bro, you've got issues.  I know.  There was, uh.  Oh, he pays for that.

You had an asshole right in your face.  Good morning, sir.  Yeah.  I mean, goddamn, you're a more man than me.  I'll tell you that.  I fucking love the dude.  Damn it.  He don't care what the, as long as it's got a fucking pussy and an asshole.  A nice pussy.  I have a fucking immediate pussy.  And he can sniff.  I think that, well, I think that one of them maybe had a snip job and a little tuck deal  going on.  I was thinking that.  I was thinking that.  Well, what happened? 
[03:22:30]  I was thinking that exact thing.  What, the blonde, right?  Legit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had a deeper voice than me.  He had a deep voice.  Hey, what's up, Jimmy?  Jimmy.

You stink and I don't like you.  You are garbage.  I know you'll be lying on your stomach for a week crying and pretending it's just comfortable  that way.  I'm the reason you motherfucker you drive a truck.  I have a Saturn. 
[03:24:00]  I cruise off to Manhattan, 43rd Street to 15th Street.  Circle for four hours.  Back home.  Wah, wah, penis.  Wah, wah, penis.  Yes, Ramon.  Don't fail at home.  I really hope he lost his leg in some type of an auto injury.  You people have no idea if I could blow my brains out in front of you right now, I would.  I'm a fat pig. 
[03:24:30]  I don't care if I can throw your eggs down the toilet, buy a series and then fuck your mother.  You're a fat girl with L.A. gear sneakers and I hope you hit a pole and die.  You have the perception of an autistic.  Oh, you really are an ass.  A little fat belly.  A little fat pale fish belly.  A little fat stupid boy.  No, stupid.  That's not what I'm telling you.  Of course.  Funniest thing to ever come out of your mouth was your boyfriend's cock. 
[03:25:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wow, that was really good.  Yeah, I liked the first one.  That really showed you a lot of your personality.  That's at the end of the remix, by the way.

And everyone raves about his performance.  And we think we're going to lose him. 
[03:26:00]  Really?  I think there's no turning back.  I think this is the day you...  It'll be Anthony and Taz.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  You know what?  Hey.  Hey, you know what?  Go in and fucking eat that brajol out there.  I'll call for the boys here.  I have a brajol.  Why don't we have a little tryout?  I can't believe we both going home.  I got a tryout.  Why don't we do a little tryout here with Taz while I'm here?  I'm a local guy.  You know what I mean?  Where are you from, Jimmy?  I actually live in New York now, but I grew up in New Jersey.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Jimmy Day, Goodbye by DJ New Style featuring our friend Rob Bartlett from the I'm His Show. 
[03:26:30]  Oh.  Oh.  A-G-P.  Pee on your chest.  A-T-I.  I.  I think you got it.  Hepatitis C.  Now it's time to say goodbye to Jimmy and his friends.  Is it J-I-M-M-Y-N-O-R-T-O-N?  We need to leave and drink some pee, my face in your rear end. 
[03:27:00]  Do ya?  J-I-M-M-Y-N-O-R-T-O-N.  Jimmy Norton.  A little fat stupid boy.  Jimmy Norton.  A little fat male fish belly.  He'll tell us that we always seem to stink, stink, stink, stink.  Tune in next time and you'll hear a meaty-breasted.  I'm a fat pig.  J-I-M-M-Y-N-O-R-T-O-N.  Yeah.  That's fucking...  That was Rob Bartlett.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:27:30]  Rob Bartlett is the fucking...  He actually had a...  I didn't even address this like last week.  He had a you stink and I don't like you shirt, which is one of my shirts.  He's a huge supporter and so is I'm a good shirt.  They're great friends.  It's a little back story on Bartlett.  I don't know if you guys know this.  He actually did what I did before I did it, if that makes sense.  He worked for...  WWF?  Yeah.  He was doing color commentary years ago.  I didn't know that.  Only like a few shows.  The first Monday Night Raw, he was the color guy.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to ask him about that.  Yeah, it's a true story.  That's pretty cool.  Thank you, Rob.  All right.  The next one is a montage of comedians wishing Jimmy a happy day. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, this is going to be...  I saw Bam at the cellar, so if he got any of those fucking animals, this is going to  be really pleasant.  Did he see my camera that day?  I'm still looking for my digital camera.  But yeah, Bam was outside just waiting for comedians to show up so they could wish you  a happy Jimmy day.  You want that water there?  Jimmy would be a guy.  Here we go.  I could use some water, too.  Any bottle of water?  Get a water for the boss.  Any bottle of water?  Hey, he's the boss.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to piss my new boss.  No, no, no, no, no.  Where's that goddamn...  I don't want to leave, Taz.  Where's that goddamn dump report?  Can I have a chocolate chip?  No, you can't.  I want it.  I want the dump report immediately. 
[03:28:30]  We'll do it later, Anthony.  Yeah, but I want it in front of me.  All right.  Yeah, get the dump report, too.  Get the dump report.  All right, dude.  The skanks are leaving.  Bye, skanks.  Take a bath.  Take a bath.  I love the girl.  Yeah, Jimmy was in love.  They were hot, man.  Okay.  You've got to get out more, bro.  Yeah, right?  That's like Devil's Island hot.  When you become a big TV star, you'll see hot.  I'm telling you, man, yeah.  That fucking vag was fat in my face. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, it's also called a cock.  Let's be honest.  You say potato, I say potato.  Let's listen to comedians wishing Jimmy a happy Jimmy Day.  That's his favorite song.  You know, this is Boss.  They said to insult you, and there's no reason I would insult you on the biggest day of your life. 
[03:29:30]  Happy Jimmy's Day.  And from all your victims, kill yourself.  No, I don't even like that one.  Look, I'm too fucking big to be standing on a fucking stoop, saying happy whatever to a fucking meanie chick.  He's the best.  I hope it shows big, man.  He's going to fucking hit big, and he deserves it.  Yeah, that's nice.  You hear that worm bail out of his mom?  Why don't you get a fucking life? 
[03:30:00]  Boy, how many friends do you have, by the way?  This is a three-minute montage, and one minute's already done.  What did Bam get three?  A minute each?  What Ben just handed me couldn't be real.  All right, hold on.  Back to this.  I'll just say that for a second.  This couldn't be real.  A couple of microphones.  Good evening.  Why am I not getting it?  Why?  All right, so this is, I get it.  I like how you whisper it, and you turn your head like they're not going to hear you.  Look at me.  You didn't want to look at me.  That's how bad this is. 
[03:30:30]  You're embarrassed for me.  Out in the middle of this.  Yeah, all right, fuck you, asshole.  All right, we're here on McDougal Street, and this is Robert Kelly, and I just want to  wish little Jimmy Norton, the thumb puppet that he is, a happy Jimmy Day.  Happy, happy Jimmy Day.  Happy Jimmy Day.  Happy Jimmy.  That's my song to you, Jimmy.  God bless you.  I love you, and have a great day, you faggot.  Hey, it's Dave Attell, and happy Jimmy Day. 
[03:31:00]  Jimmy and I rock the Bergada in New Jersey, and then I saw him whoring out, selling T-shirts,  adult diapers, and whatnot, after the show.  But, Jim, you are the man.  That's about it.  Wow.  Hey, this is Ben Bailey.  What's up, Jim Norton?  Future little creep.  I think for Jimmy Day, I'm going to take you to dinner at your favorite seafood restaurant, 
[03:31:30]  Steamer's Landing.  Have a great fucking Jimmy Day.  Yo, what's up?  This is Keith Robinson.  Happy Jimmy Day.  Happy Jimmy Day.  This is where Jim Norton will actually guess the size of every transvestite that shows up  that day.  He'll guess the penis size.  And cut or uncut.  Uncut.  He'll catch it.  That's right.  Instead of face painting, like they did last year, they're actually going to have tranny face  paintings, where they're just going to blow their load right in Jimmy's face. 
[03:32:00]  With Jimmy Day.  They're going to try to make them look like every singer from Kiss.  That's Robert Kelly of Keith Robinson.  Happy Jimmy Day.  Fucking positive.  You're calling good.  Everybody.  Very nice.  Thank you very much.  I'd like to point out, I just got a text message from one Bubba Ray Dudley.  Oh, I remember Bubba Ray.  Hell yeah.  He has XM and listens to you guys all the time still.  He's still there. 
[03:32:30]  Anyone who's hated Jimmy, good luck and shit like that.  Oh, thank you, man.  I met Bubba Ray once at any W.  He would kill you, by the way.  He would just kill you.  I know he would.  Give me a good mouth fucking straightener right now.  He was nice enough to give me a limo ride back to Long Island, and he pulled over to  the side of the road to let me out, and I proceeded to just start puking, because I  had the side seat.  That's the worst deal, man.  That's the worst.  That or the back one, you know.  I'm finally hanging out with, like, men, you know, like, real dudes, and I'm puking. 
[03:33:00]  Like a little girl on the side of the road.  Last time I saw you was at, um, when they had WWF New York.  Remember, you came to one of the shows, one of the live MTV shows.  No, but this was, like, after you guys did the XFL stuff.  Uh-huh.  How many of you guys did that?  Years ago.  Yeah, we're talking about it a long time ago.  We go back.  Yeah.  Now we got Rob Bartlett.  Dr. Phil speaks about Jim Norton.  Ooh.  Rob Bartlett did a little Dr. Phil for you, Jimmy.  Ooh.  Get up, get up, get up, get up. 
[03:33:30]  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.  This is Dr. Phil.  Even without the yellow treats and the trannies and the crinkle, crinkle paper bags on the feet  and rest up men's rooms, what we have here with this Norton character is a child's garden  of perversion and dysfunction.  You do know that, right?  I mean, Monster Rain?  What the hell ever happened just playing Cowboys and Indians, huh?  Or stickball or Candyland, for Christ's sake? 
[03:34:00]  Happy Jimmy Day to the funniest, most talented comic working today.  Not you.  Damn, you guys love Bartlett.  And we got one more thing from the gang at fullblownaids.com.  They took it upon themselves to do this.  We didn't ask them.  That's what's great about these listeners.  Brian Wilson says, Happy Jimmy Day.  It's Rob Bartlett again.  Round, round, get around, I get around.  Yeah, get around, round, round, I get around, I get around. 
[03:34:30]  Hi, I'm Brian Wilson.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Happy Jimmy Day to little Jimmy the Joke Man Motley.  I am fated, Monster Rain.  Tell him Fred.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Okay, man.  I'm part of the rules, man.  Bam and the gang at fullblownaids. 
[03:35:00]  Thank you guys so much, man.  Great job.  And all the listeners, you know, and Whackbag, man, they changed the site for me today.  And fucking just all the, it's really great, man.  Thank you guys so much.  How embarrassed were you that Whackbag changed their site for you today after so much bitching  yesterday?  And yesterday, you spent half the day pretty much calling everyone a content.  Wait, no, no, but on the phone, I was on the, well, I was actually posting on Mac, oh,  I bet yesterday.  I was fucking, I wasn't even that mad.  I was just correcting some people.  Me and Jimmy were posting on separate strings, threads on the site.  They must have been like, oh, man. 
[03:35:30]  This seems like a goodbye show.  Just like your last show.  I know.  Someone's saying it's like a funeral, it's creepy, it's like Jimmy died.  No, we're just acknowledging that Jimmy's ready to blow up.  Because they were helping me out, because I'm doing DVD signing tonight, and then Lucky  Louie is, you know, so the XM was actually, I think it was Eric and Logan came up with  Don Wick and went with Jimmy Dave.  Yeah, let's just do all this together.  That's cool, yeah, yeah.  But it kind of fell apart.  We were still going to do the signing tonight.  Right.  Open it myself.  But fucking the listeners.  This is turning into, yeah.  Came up through fullblownAids.com and Bam and Happy Typing Girl.  They just fucking put all this stuff together, and these maniacs showed up. 
[03:36:00]  That's cool.  It was just creepy, supportive.  They're just great.  Yeah, 66th and Broadway tonight at 6 o'clock, Tower Records.  So when you become huge, you're going to tell everyone, who?  Fuck you.  You're going to forget about everybody, right?  You're going to forget faster than you can fucking get your heads out.  You are perfectly made for that.  Oh, no doubt.  That's a pro, right?  That's super pro, right?  My trippy sincerity is fucking, believe me, where all the episode money triples.  I'm fucking who?  What fucking radio?  What fucking radio?  I don't want to fuck you.  Radio hurts my back. 
[03:36:30]  I don't want to sit in a day.  I do radio now with pictures, asshole.  Talk TV.  Yeah.  Look into it.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  We'll do the dump report, and then we've got to talk about this in front of us.  We're just laughing at this.  I can't stop laughing.  And we've got Taz.  We'll talk about the WWE pay-per-view.  ECW pay-per-view.  ECW.  It's called the same thing.  One-night stand, just like you.  One-night stand.  It is called one-night stand.  People have some questions about ECW.  Okay, I'll answer them.  We'll do all that next.  Don't get upset.  And now, a parenting tip from the Jim Norton Daycare Center.  How to get little Timmy to take a nap. 
[03:37:00]  Attaboy, Timmy.  Go to bed.  Hey, this is Porn Whore, Mary Carey.  And you're listening to my little, trust me, little pal, Timmy Norton.  All right, we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[03:37:30]  It's sort of Jimmy Day who brought the food.  Rivoli, Tom's River.  The guy's great.  He's a big supporter of the show.  Something called a coffee cake muffin.  How is it?  It's as big as your fucking head.  How is it?  And it is so goddamn good.  I want a coffee cake muffin.  Get a coffee cake muffin.  I want one, too. 
[03:38:00]  You want one?  I'll go get coffee cake.  You will adore it.  I'm good, bro.  I'm watching my coffee.  Can we get some coffee cake muffins?  Can we get coffee cake muffins?  Uh-oh.  There might not be any more.  Rivoli's in studio.  What's your name again, bro?  Tony Rivoli.  How many were there?  Tony?  Tony Rivoli.  Rivoli.  Rivoli.  Rivoli.  Rivoli.  I keep saying Rivoli's.  It's Rivoli's.  It was only one coffee cake muffin muffin.  How about you name your restaurant  something we could all pronounce?  Exactly.  Rivoli's.  Rivoli's.  All fresh baked.  And it's Tom's River.  What's the address?  781 Fisher Boulevard, Tom's River. 
[03:38:30]  Right.  Pests get free apps.  And he invites all of us  to go down there for a free meal,  but I'm not in Tom's River.  On your way to Lang City, stop by.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Right off the parking.  That looks good, Anthony.  It's not a bad idea.  It's so good.  I need one of those.  There's no more left.  Oh, my God.  None left?  No.  Ha ha.  It's Anthony Day.  It comes to this.  Let's do the dump report, huh?  Oh, sorry.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios,  the Daily Dump Report.  We usually do this a lot earlier in the show, 
[03:39:00]  so maybe there's a lot of people out there  that don't know what this is about.  We do the first half of the show.  It's heard on commercial radio,  so we've got to keep it friendly.  A little friendlier.  Derek sure can hit a fucking cue, can't he?  Hold on one second.  Is that coffee cake?  How long is a fucking delay  between the time opening?  I want a piece of that.  Let's do the report,  and it actually went boom.  Hold on.  I'm getting a piece of that coffee cake,  a teeny piece.  That's all I want.  Where?  Kevin has.  I just want a little sliver.  Kevin has the last one?  I only want a sliver.  No, I don't care.  I don't want you to took the last one.  I'll let him have it.  Wow.  He's a goose. 
[03:39:30]  It's Jimmy Day.  You've got to give up.  No, you have to give up that coffee cake.  There's the knife.  I didn't have.  And give me half.  Yeah, you should give that up for Jimmy  for sort of Jimmy Day.  Give me half.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All I want?  Oh, my gosh.  That's all I can have.  Wait, I want a piece that big, Jimmy.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  All right, Kevin, you get out of there.  You guys are gahoon.  This guy, he's like,  Hey, it's good.  Hey, it's good, huh?  Jimmy, where do you fit this food in that box?  You know what? 
[03:40:00]  He just had sex.  Yeah.  That's all kind of whatever that was.  That's kind of like a disturbing type of thing  he did before, whatever that was.  Usually, he's got to eat after sex  to get the taste to come out of his mouth.  Is that Rivoli's?  You made this?  Hold on a second.  I do not do that.  He heard it.  He heard it.  He certainly did.  I leave the taste there.  Why waste it?  Give me those ribs.  Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug.  Ka-ching, ka-ching.  This fucking coffee cake is amazing.  Isn't it great?  I can't.  What about you?  I can't eat it, dude. 
[03:40:30]  Isn't it very filling?  Why?  Filling, and it's doing things to my little gut.  Oh, because you got that little chain.  Are you going to have to go poo right now?  No, but I'm going to have to go back to my studio and sweat for a while.  Poor Steve.  He had the stomach stapling years ago.  Yes.  He looked good.  Did you get implants in your arms?  He's got pretty thick arms there.  What do you got going on?  No, I didn't do that.  Look at that.  The motherfucker's working out like a maniac.  I could tell.  He's a big guy.  If he wasn't such a faggot, he'd be tough.  He's got to get that village people look going on.  That's all right.  Don't hit me from behind, either. 
[03:41:00]  Fucking YMCA over here.  Dump report, yes.  At 6.13, I said, cunts, what?  I think I was doing a cunt says what joke.  You caught yourself after the S.  That was the beauty of it.  After the S in cunts, I think I was too late.  Thank God Al Dukes was there to hit the dump button.  I know Al.  I know Al.  He doesn't.  Al's a good guy.  But you got a blowjob from him.  Yeah, I did, actually.  Yeah, I did. 
[03:41:30]  Talk about faggots.  You're talking to Al Dukes.  He was a great guy on August 15, 2002.  Yeah.  So with the pool table, right?  Could have saved our jobs.  Yeah.  He was on the dump button back then.  And guess who's working on the dump button now?  How stupid are we?  You guys are getting set up by CBS.  Yeah, for another big fall.  Oh, that's good shit.  At 6.41, masturbate to magazines.  Jim Norton and Opie knew right then that that.  That's so weird. 
[03:42:00]  It's in the New York Post.  He was reading it verbatim.  But for something that's in the New York Post, you can't read it on regular radio because company policy.  Someone's got to wake up.  You know what it is?  It's a blanket thing here.  And I'll tell you exactly why they don't want masturbate being used on the radio.  In certain contexts, it isn't against FCC regulations.  It's a company policy to not use the word masturbate on the radio because to police every show on how they use it, it got to be too much for them. 
[03:42:30]  So they decided the only safe way to protect the license is to have everybody on our staff not ever use the word masturbate.  And we discussed this.  A lot of people are scared of the FCC should be scared of the big corporations because they're making their own rules.  They're making up their self-policing rules.  Even as the fines go higher and higher, believe me, they are self-policing.  Let me interrupt.  So if you get banged for, let's say, you know, you get a fine, the talent pays that fine or CBS pays it?  No, CBS has to pay it.  Okay.  But now they just raised it or they're going to once Bush signs it into law. 
[03:43:00]  Right.  Didn't the scumbag conservatives try to make it with the artist pay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking cocksuckers.  But they didn't get that one.  But they went from a maximum fine of $35,000 to now $350,000.  Jesus Christ.  Ten times.  Ten times.  Wow.  That's almost double.  All right.  Could be a couple more than that, Jim.  Hey, do we have the dumps for the week?  Oh, that's right.  Let's see.  At 724, Julie Kahn-t. 
[03:43:30]  Opie was talking about Julie Kahn.  That's her real name.  She's the GM of, I don't know, the Boston cluster for our competition.  As Al explains it, it was dumped because it was the closest one to the word kunt.  He got a little too close with Kahn and the T.  Other times, there was enough separation between Kahn and the T.  So some people heard that?  Yeah, well, XM heard it all.  That was the only time I was funny today.  So I'm glad they heard something.  They just missed one. 
[03:44:00]  I blew a great joke on the street.  I'm still embarrassed by that.  What was the other word you said?  It didn't really matter, though.  That my, that, I don't know, some old lady said she came from England.  I was trying to say, well, I came from my dad's balls.  Oh, you said I came from my, what did you say?  My dad's balls.  On the walk of my dad's balls.  I just screwed it up.  But then I had a great line.  I go, you know what?  My mom should have just blown him that day.  Very funny.  Nice.  You know what happened at first?  You got scared.  I really did.  You got scared.  At 847.  This one, another gray area one. 
[03:44:30]  Opie responding to an instant feedbacker.  Jennifer, you're just a cunt.  Boy, that falls into that zone where.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Well, because cunting is a kind of an adverb.  Well, she says I have a lot of hate.  I don't have as much hate anymore.  I'm a different person.  And then I get dumped.  Still enough hate.  Whackbag.  But I don't like the fact that.  I don't like this because I didn't say whackbag.com.  Why can't you say whackbag?  Exactly.  Because there's a company policy on websites that contain a certain amount of pornography  or links to pornography.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Until that's straightened out in some way, shape, or form, we can't mention whackbag.com. 
[03:45:00]  I don't like them dumping the word whackbag.  That's got to be stopped.  Yeah.  I wasn't using it as a whackbag.com or visit the website.  You weren't promoting the website.  You were just right.  I was saying, yeah, I said, no, that's quoting whackbag, and it wasn't whackbag.com.  I mean, if I don't know what whackbag.com is, that could be a guy named whackbag.  Whackbag is a word I got from Jim Florentine, and then I sat around dice, and just in like  a casual thing, like, yeah, I'm whacking my bag.  Not whackbag, whacking my bag. 
[03:45:30]  It's just for jerking off.  No, you stole that from me.  Andrew heard that.  Hey, Jacob.  No, I don't think you stole it.  It was just like it's something I would say.  I never said it as a joke.  I was talking to him one time, and that was just like, you know, it was just like a normal  thing to say.  I'm like, I got to go whack my bag, man.  Fuck him.  Whatever.  He goes, whack your bag.  And then he just, he did it on stage, basically to make me and Florentine laugh.  And he did it with like a whole whackbag, whackbag.  And that's how, when he said it on the show, whackbag came to be.  Yeah, whackbag.  It's not a real word.  No.  So the only listeners know that word, because of Florentine, and I heard, guys overheard 
[03:46:00]  me in that poem.  So it's a slang word, more or less.  But it's not even slang.  It's ours.  Florentine.  It's not even for sexual content.  It's a made up word.  You know, they just don't want the name of the website on there.  They're telling, and believe me, keep it up over there, and I won't either.  So it's nice to see that after a month and a half, you guys, the relationship with CBS  is going really well.  No, actually, it really is going well.  Or surprisingly well.  We thought we'd have a lot of a couple of months.  You know why?  Because we got this right here.  So you can release it right here. 
[03:46:30]  Whenever we get any shit over there about what we can talk about, we can come here.  You saw what happened.  Yeah, I did.  It was graphically described.  We could say anything we want.  I think after witnessing that, I'm going to be fucking celibate forever.  That was fucking brutal.  Uh-oh.  Jimmy must have found something hysterical.  Jimmy.  What's all about?  This is great.  Jimmy.  Jimmy must have found something hysterically funny.  It's the only time he laughs like this. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, it's...  Hold on.  Wow, he can barely even contain himself.  Hold on to your Zeppelies.  It's the Wise Guys show.  Oh, I get it.  Hold on to your Zeppelies.  And it's got some wise guys.  This could be worse than Mantown.  Uh, no.  No, it can't.  I heard that in a way in.  I heard you guys do that when I was driving in.  That was funny shit.  It was very funny.  Yeah, I heard it.  We're really funny.  That was fucking Mantown. 
[03:47:30]  No, that was funny, bro.  I'm serious.  No, no.  I'm not going to blow smoke up your ass.  We know we're funny, though.  No, no.  I didn't say you're funny.  I just said that was funny.  I said that was funny.  You still intonate the hell out of me, dude.  That's right.  There was one time.  Who did you want to beat the crap out of?  Was it Rick?  Yeah.  Where is that guy?  No, not Ben.  Rick.  Rick.  Where is he?  Oh, he's...  That little fucker.  I don't like that guy.  Gonzo.  Yeah, it got real one day with...  It did get real.  ...with Taz.  I was different then.  I was a little bit more...  Not many people scare me. 
[03:48:00]  Taz still...  Taz is a fucking...  Taz is a problem.  Why would you...  He's got that look.  I mean, he's got that look.  I recognize the look.  He's how you know...  Trust me, I recognize the look.  And I don't see it in many guys.  I've seen it in Taz.  Taz is a problem because he's like laughing and happy.  He's a nice dude.  Right.  So you know that there's a fucking face-biter in there.  Unlike a pillow-biter like yourself.  I don't like the fact he implies that I'm a rookie and I have to buy a pillow.  He's just one of my... 
[03:48:30]  Hey, you want me to replace this guy?  Impossible.  Who the fuck here, Paul?  That motherfucker.  My Giuseppoli, since it'll hold him.  LOL, wise guys.  LOL.  Wise guys are funny guys.  All right, let's get into this.  Is this worse than Man Town?  This is fucking worse than child rape.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, Jimmy.  That's too bad.  There's no comedy in that at all.  No, Jimmy.  It's very hurtful.  It's going to be offending someone out there.  Oh, hey, easy.  Oh, nice thing you know, he's going to be bringing up Amber Alerts to a famous NHL star. 
[03:49:00]  Unbelievable.  By the way...  Oh, God forbid my kids get kidnapped.  Whoops.  And then I'm like, I didn't mean...  I didn't mean your kids.  I mean, if you're going to rape children, you're going to be safe.  Fucking asshole I am.  By the way, Jim Leiritz is in a bit of trouble after his appearance on our show yesterday.  Oh, it was ancient history.  Well, it's in Newsday, and the AP has picked up on it, so other papers are going with it.  The whole, I popped the...  He popped some greenies.  Some greenies, a little amphetamines before a few Yankee games. 
[03:49:30]  Ah, come on.  Oh, he said that I didn't hear the show yesterday.  He said it here.  But look, it's in the sports section of Newsday, and they highlighted the entire article, so  it draws your attention.  I'll just...  We'll get back to that in a second.  Leiritz, I was taking greenies.  In his April 19th interview with federal officials, Jason Grimsley reportedly said everybody had  greenies.  That's like aspirin.  Count Jim Leiritz, Yankee fan favorite, is one of everybody.  In an interview yesterday morning with radio, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock  jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks. 
[03:50:00]  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony, Leiritz confessed to taking greenies or amphetamines.  I can remember my first amphetamine, Leiritz said on the Opie and Anthony show, which airs on  blah, blah, blah, as well as XM.  I was out all night drinking with Andy Hawkins and some of the guys on the team.  I was a young player.  I came in.  I was hungover, sleeping by my locker before a game, and all of a sudden, Don Mattingly  came to me and said, hey, you're in the lineup, and I went, what?  He goes, yeah, I just hurt my back.  Now I'm walking around.  I'm going, I don't know how I'm going to do this. 
[03:50:30]  There's no way that I can go play this game today.  I ran into my teammate, who I knew had some of the little helpers, as they call them.  He said, take one of these.  It should help.  It'll take the edge off.  So sure enough, I took one.  He goes, okay, you can take two, but no more than two.  So I popped one more, and I went out and went three for four with two homers.  They didn't quote my line.  No.  What line?  After each homer, you rounded the bases eight times.  Amphetamine joke.  We had some really good lines in there. 
[03:51:00]  Jim was just joking.  God forbid they throw a little comedy in there.  I know.  How about a laugh for the love of Eve?  Oh, my God.  Well, if you're looking for laughs.  Back to you.  I got these Zeppelis.  Hey.  Hold on to your Zeppelis.  No, you're breaking my meatballs over here.  Get out of here.  We're going to break.  Are you?  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something.  Is the laughter ever end over there?  I think not.  If this was a black show, it would just be like a Sambo show.  Hold on to your Lordy Melons.  Yeah, hold on to your Lordy Melons. 
[03:51:30]  Well, Lordy Lord, people here, let me tell you about what Master done to me last night.  That's how stereotypical this ginzo fucking.  Can I point out one thing?  I was invited on that thing a year ago to be a guest, and I passed.  Hey, you was, huh?  Yeah.  You better camp me in my deal.  What?  I passed to the honor.  I fucking heard it.  That's correct.  Ah.  Soprano lines.  Bah-ha.  Ah.  Well, some of the segments they got here. 
[03:52:00]  Well, it's a celebration of life, arts, and meatballs.  Ha-ha.  Oh.  Look at them.  Oh.  Shut up, you idiots.  Shut up.  Stop celebrating the dumbest part of your culture.  Shut up.  Oh.  Mother used to make meatballs.  Rest in peace.  Yeah.  Should she?  Fuck her.  Black dress wearing fucking melodramatic idiots.  Shut up. 
[03:52:30]  So there's a picture here of a big pussy.  Who I, by the way, I like Vinny Pastore a lot.  All right.  You fucking phony Hollywood cunt.  I only met him.  Stop it.  I met him one time on Tough Crowd.  He was very nice.  Stop it.  He's an asshole.  He was nice to me.  I find him annoying.  Beat up his wife.  How do you not love this guy?  Oh.  How do you say you like the guy?  You just ripped up his show and you say you like him.  That's the beauty of me.  Nice.  I do like him.  I can't be dishonest.  He's never consistent.  Okay.  Now they just call the little t-shirts big pussy shirts. 
[03:53:00]  Ah.  Vinny Pastore shirts.  Excuse me.  Okay.  But the dialogue here is very funny.  Oh, it certainly is.  Nice to see you.  Have a seat.  Your waiter, he's a little slow tonight.  He's in the back listening to the wise guy show.  I'm serious.  So why is he slow?  He probably fell asleep.  It's a...  Waiting for a laugh?  Very funny.  Oh, yes.  It's a regular thing every Wednesday. 
[03:53:30]  You can even listen online.  Blah, blah, blah.  Here's a tip.  Avoid the clams tonight.  Not so good.  But the wise guy show, now we're talking.  First, you got Vinny Big Pussy Pastore.  Then there's musician, actor, and all around nice guy, little Steven Van Zandt.  And...  He's not an Italian.  Why is he on the fucking show?  I know.  He produces the show.  He's a wise guy.  He's the Jew producer.  You need the money, man.  You know how the Jews are with their money. 
[03:54:00]  Give it to a Jew producer.  Mad on.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Get all Jaime out of here.  We're doing business.  Come on.  Give it to a Jew producer in another district.  Not to our paisan.  Big Pussy does not get that picture.  So who's his staff here?  John Cha-Cha Charishi.  Charishi.  Unofficial mayor of Little Italy.  What does that mean?  Brooklyn Joe Cousi.  Pride of the only borough that matters.  Hey.  I don't even got to say what the fuck it is. 
[03:54:30]  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Hey.  Brooklyn.  This is like the Joe Pesci show coming to life.  Coming to life.  The bit.  Remember the old bit that Brewer did on SNL?  Oh my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Joe Joey Rags Rigano.  One of Big Pussy's movie buddies.  And Uncle Floyd Vivino.  One of the hardest working men in show business.  Is that Uncle Floyd the guy from the...  Fucking Uncle Floyd show.  That's the guy?  From the Uncle Floyd show.  I don't know.  No, I don't know.  So did I.  I'm sure everyone who listens to that program does as well. 
[03:55:00]  No one cares about Uncle Floyd.  Come on, they do a What's Your Beef segment.  Big Pussy and the Boys help us.  This is a blow-off theme by getting some things off your chest.  So what's your beef?  You want to get something off your chest?  Like maybe some rocks that we put there?  Why don't you just shut up?  Please, shut up.  Hey, we play some games over there.  You want to play a game?  We play Guess the Wise Guy.  Oh!  Oh!  The boys play a snippet of a famous Wise Guy movie. 
[03:55:30]  You call and guess the name of the film.  Character and actor.  Guess correctly or get whacked.  Oh!  You're going to get whacked over there.  Why don't you just stop embarrassing yourselves?  The only way that would be funny is if you missed the question and someone did shoot you.  Absolutely.  By the way, they come by and put an ice pick in the back of your head.  I want to play the Wise Guys game.  Well, you've got to give them a call.  The number is 1-866-YO-VINNY.  Yo-VINNY.  1-866-YO-VINNY.  Y'all know.  There's going to be a character going, Ramone! 
[03:56:00]  1-866-YO-VINNY.  Yo-VINNY.  I want to play Guess the Wise Guy.  Well, I'm sure the pest will be all over it.  1-866-YO-VINNY.  They do the news in a segment called, What the Hell Happened This Week?  Oh, just like we do.  We're just regular guys.  We're doing Brooklyn!  Oh!  Oh!  Hey!  Hey, Joey Chops!  What the hell happened this week?  I'm not on!  Hey, don't break my meatballs!  Laugh!  Laugh!  Laugh!  Laugh!  Laugh!  From no one.  Then they got the Agumba group.  Know those Sunday morning shows where guys in bow ties yell at each other about the politics 
[03:56:30]  of the week?  Forget about it!  Oh, that hasn't been used too much.  Yeah, the proverbial forget about it.  You know, F-U-H-G-E-D-T.  Hey, but you know, forget about Big Pussy and the Boys of the Pussy Institute.  Oh!  There's fucking bits everywhere!  Hey, they're flying!  Get the kids out of here!  They're flying!  Laugh's are coming!  Do it every week, too, except they know what they're talking about. 
[03:57:00]  Oh!  Trivial prosciutto.  Oh, my God.  It's Trivial Prosciut.  Instead of Trivial Pursuit, they named it Trivial Prosciut.  Get it?  That's actually pretty good, I think.  Holy shit.  This, this, I'm looking at this right now.  There's more humor in Mein Kampf than in this fucking, this is the worst fucking thing  I've ever read.  Don't sell that book short for laughs.  Trivial Prosciut.  This ain't no board game. 
[03:57:30]  It's a thinly sliced, very tasty salute to Italian-American history.  We play with callers who think they got a clue.  You got the cannolis to play?  Oh, my God.  Give the boys a call.  1-866-YOVINY.  You got the cannolis to play?  Yes.  Do you know how that would be funny?  If they said, yeah, we got Lance Armstrong coming in.  He's only got one cannoli.  And then there's Meatball Serenade. 
[03:58:00]  Meatball Serenade.  What's a gathering of Goombas without a nice meal?  Hopefully a funeral.  You smell the gravy as the gang tells stories and enjoy food from New York City's finest Italian  restaurants.  It's a brajol melody, a sausage symphony, it's a Meatball Serenade, a manja.  Oh, manja.  Wow.  Wow.  I swear to you, this is fucking insulting. 
[03:58:30]  Do you want to hear a bunch of fucking guys?  I agree.  Oh, it is insulting.  It is brutally insulting.  What's entertaining about a bunch of people eating around a table, unless they're fucking  bulimics, then it's kind of funny, because you know they'll all be running to the bathroom.  Why did I explain a joke as it bombed?  Every Wednesday.  I don't know.  I don't need for it.  Every Wednesday.  Oh!  Oh!  Someone cut the brakes or I got whacked!  Oh!  Oh!  Hey, yeah.  Shit.  Every Wednesday at 6, the show is on.  This is...  1-866-YO-VINNY. 
[03:59:00]  This is just as bad as, like, a hip-hop show where they're like, you know, hey, it's Coon  Day.  That's right.  We're gonna do fucking Coon Day, yo.  Throw some watermelon at you.  Yeah, watermelon trivia.  Yo.  You know, how many swogies did it take to clear a cotton field?  Yeah, that's exactly like how offended I feel with this fucking dreck.  We're gonna play some games.  Pick a cod or pick a ninny! 
[03:59:30]  Oh!  Oh!  I hear you!  You're crazy!  Oh!  Are you breaking my hump?  Oh!  You dummies!  Oh, my God.  That is wonderful.  Wow.  A Jewish show with an Auschwitz segment?  We're gonna bring a guy named Schvitz in, and you try to hurt him so he goes, ow!  You!  You match the number on your dollar bill to the number on his arms!  You win a free pack!  Oh, my God!  You stupid guineas. 
[04:00:00]  It's all just the worst.  Like, and believe me, I'm the last guy that bitches when these fucking Italian guys come  up and say the mob movies are racist, and it shows Italians in a bad light.  I'm the last one that ever bitches about that.  It's entertaining.  It's fun.  It's cool to watch.  It is part of the culture.  But this dreck is just, like, over the top, trying too hard to be fucking guinea.  You know?  It's just, it's horrid. 
[04:00:30]  It's not even funny.  The mighty pussy art players.  A little culture for you.  Very little.  Words don't do it justice.  You gotta hear it to believe it.  And then movie reviews.  Who needs thumbs when you got meatballs?  Another fucking meatball reference.  Wow.  Get the scoop on Hollywood's latest from a Paisan point of view.  Oh, that's gonna be entertaining, because those guys will say anything.  You better sit down for that segment, folks.  Hey, what is Schindler's list? 
[04:01:00]  I don't know what that means.  I'm on a list of the Bonabin!  Yeah!  That's all that matters to me.  Give me a list of the Bonabin!  Shut up!  Holocaust.  Holler if you want more lasagna.  Holler!  Holocaust cutting!  Can we work out of the back of the truck?  Yeah!  It goes in the front door, out the back door.  Hey!  What do you know?  I don't know nothing.  Ah, get out of here.  Go to break.  Forget about it.  Forget about it!  Forget about it! 
[04:01:30]  Forget about it!  You know they got that sign when you come over to Verrazano from Staten Island to Brooklyn.  They got a fucking sign that says, Brooklyn, forget about it.  Forget about it, yeah.  I'm from Brooklyn, and that's like annoying.  Well, let me tell you, Brooklyn, I did.  I fucking moved.  Yeah, me too.  Enough fucking tickets for parking on the wrong side of the road on whatever fucking day.  They actually have that on the fucking sign?  Forget about it.  Something Brooklyn nice to get up there.  I have my driver.  I tapped my driver.  He made a fucking U-turn.  You made a U-turn away to work, Lou. 
[04:02:00]  That's right.  We listen to the Wise Guy Show?  Maybe.  All right, a couple things we got to get out of here for the day.  The tuning handles behind the toilet.  You could change the station.  Hey, I want my brother walking out of there with more than just a shitty serious radio in his hand.  Or in both his arms.  We got to line up the plugs.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, the dump chart for the week.  Hey, who is number uno?  Forget about it.  Speaking of the dumps.  I'm speaking Spanish.  Speaking of the dumps.  Look at the shitty auto. 
[04:02:30]  Let's get out of here.  Don't ask me where he is.  I don't know what the fuck I got.  I know something about the weekly dump chart.  Yeah.  Anthony's moving up.  Moving up on the list.  All unintentional.  Moving up.  Oh.  I've been framed.  Really fast.  Rich Voss had one dump this week.  The production.  The O&A production got one dump this week.  That was Sam, yeah.  Francine got one dump.  Oh.  Jimmy Norton got four.  Four dumps.  One of them was not accurate, though. 
[04:03:00]  Anthony got five.  Five of them.  Bob Kelly had five dumps in a four-minute phone call.  Yeah.  Hotty mouth.  If you remember.  The callers themselves had five.  Opie, I haven't heard your name yet.  You're kicking ass, Opie.  How many?  You are kicking ass.  Nine dumps for the week?  I actually had the square root of your dumps.  Nine.  I've been doing radio.  Mathematics.  That's no good.  And I've been doing radio longer than everyone.  That's the best part about it.  Right.  I can't have it.  Those two years are reading.  I like that.  I get a little angry.  Fuck out of my mind. 
[04:03:30]  You got some set of meatballs.  Oh, I'm going to kick it right now.  I don't know.  They're going to be.  I'm not angry.  I'm just trying to keep the XMers very happy.  Hey, we got some good guests today.  Oh, we're going to ring the back tie in this.  I'm going to shoot.  Oh, fuck out of my mind.  I will forget about it.  You know why?  Because it stinks.  That's why.  Let's talk to Taz for a couple of minutes.  The ECW, what's it called again?  One Night Stand.  One Night Stand.  Yeah, we were doing live reads at the other place for it.  Oh, cool.  Actually, it sounds like it's going to be a good one. 
[04:04:00]  It's going to be hot.  You got Mick Foley coming back.  You got a lot of guys coming back.  ECW is coming back.  I don't know if you guys know that.  The actual brand is coming back because it will be live starting this Tuesday weekly  on SyFy, 10 p.m.  SyFy.  Yeah.  So it's going to be cool because it's going to be the old ECW with the hardcore-ness of  that and shit mixed in with Vince McMahon's feel on it.  You know what I mean?  So it's going to kind of be like a new ECW with an attitude.  So we're talking barbed wire and shit?  I think you'll see some of that.  Yeah.  And this Sunday, though, at the pay-per-view, it's going to be pretty hot. 
[04:04:30]  Like you said, Mick Foley's coming back.  Terry Funk's going to be in at Sabu's.  Now, when people like Mick Foley come back, is it going to be a real match or is it like,  oh, wow, everyone's like, I can't believe Mick Foley's wrestling.  Then two minutes in, it's over.  No, no, no.  That'll be my match.  I just kind of use his name.  Oh, that's yours?  Yeah, that'll be my match.  And they kind of use the name to get people to go.  Yeah, that'll be me.  Hi.  So they're using you for that.  No, no.  Well, yeah, I'm joking, kind of.  But Mick's match, probably go a lot longer than mine.  I'm wrestling Jared King Lawler. 
[04:05:00]  But it kind of was a challenge.  It's not really a real...  I'm going to choke him out, basically.  Right, yeah.  You don't worry about him?  You already know what you're going to do?  You're just going to choke him out?  He's 85 years old.  I'm going to choke him out.  Oh, my God, King, you're out.  We had so much fun with his situation, his personal life, man.  Oh, please don't get into that with me.  I still work there.  Oh, right.  No, he even enjoyed it.  We had him on the phone.  No, we had him on the phone, him talking about it.  We won't get into it again.  How long ago was this?  It's years now, but we thought it was one of the funniest stories ever.  He's actually an easygoing guy. 
[04:05:30]  He's a great guy.  He's actually a good guy.  He's a really good guy.  He's a funny guy, too.  We'll get into it another day.  Choke the shit out of us.  I will.  We're running out of the show, but what else?  I have nothing else to say.  But I've got to go, too, so I'm busy also.  No, we're all leaving at the same time.  I'm getting a little offended now.  Well, we're going to rock out like a bunch of broshoots.  We're going to rock out like a bunch of broshoots.  We're going to look like a bunch of crumbs falling off.  My grandmother got messed up, peace.  Got messed up, soul.  Hey, boy.  Got messed up, peace.  Whatever.  Whatever the hell out of me.  Hey, peace, Kadeel.  Let's grab your peace, Kadeel. 
[04:06:00]  Why don't you grab your fucking radio and step on it because you stink?  It's not entertaining anyone.  They're trying.  They're trying hard to make that show work over.  They're not going to make it work.  All right, so some of us will be checking out the pay-per-view.  Yeah, it'll be cool.  It's going to be cool.  And you're still doing the announcing, right?  Yes, I am.  Actually, I'd like to point out tonight on SmackDown.  I'm the color commentator of SmackDown, and I have a huge announcement tonight.  Oh.  Yes, yes.  I can't say what it is here, but tune in tonight, and I have a very big announcement, so.  Do you know Hulk Hogan?  Yes, I do. 
[04:06:30]  Okay.  Right.  Nice talking to you.  Good question.  Anyway, do you?  I like Sergeant Slaughter.  I met him in the street.  Yeah, I know Sarge.  You met him in the street.  I met him years ago.  I'm not surprised.  I've seen you in action before with those fucking rough bitches you have.  I don't mean it.  Yeah.  I got Sergeant to rub his bag on my nose.  We all laugh.  What do you think of Hulk's reality show?  I think it's kind of cute.  I think it's kind of.  No, no, no, no, no.  I think it's kind of cute.  This killer.  This killer.  Now, listen.  Why do I got a lot?  The acting is so bad. 
[04:07:00]  It's not about acting.  There's nothing real about that show.  They're handed scripts.  It's kind of a good point.  No, no.  Here's my.  Oh, check it out.  Open.  Here's the thing.  I'm friends with Hulk.  I like Hulk.  He's a personal friend.  Remember when his daughter was missing in Key West?  Yeah.  And there's a camera crew following around while she's lost?  Well, you never know.  That could happen.  Hulk and his wife are crying and stuff.  Of course.  The Secret Service.  Of course.  That happened.  Why would one camera crew call the other camera crew?  When you were Hulk Hogan, you had fucking cameras around. 
[04:07:30]  I love that.  Just look how it looks and stuff laughing.  Yeah, well, it happened.  All right.  It sucks.  The whole family did our show at the Hard Rock Cafe, and they were nothing but nice.  They gave us great radio, but I can't sit through that crap.  I need a little more from my reality show.  Well, like, let's say, some reality.  All right.  That would help.  They're doing a lot of contrived stuff.  I guess that's a little rough.  They're doing a lot of scripted reality.  Actually, that's very true. 
[04:08:00]  Which is what wrestling was for many years.  People didn't know.  No, they didn't know.  I mean, when I wrestled, I mean, the only matches that was scripted when, you know, when I lost.  When I won, it was real.  Oh, do we have that crying guy?  Yeah.  The wrestling crying guy.  Let's see how good you are, Iraq.  Play this for Taz.  See if he's heard it.  Play this.  Is there anything about it?  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on, Iraq.  You guys heard the Iron Sheik stuff, right?  I'm sure you heard that.  Oh, we love that.  Mickey Humball.  The great wrestler, Madison Square Garden. 
[04:08:30]  The great city and world.  Terran, Terran.  But he's just babbling.  He's the best.  And then he starts going,  And you think, oh, shit, something's going to blow up.  He's calling in something.  Something's going to blow up.  He's the best.  The boys are getting together.  That's a shame they bombed him and killed him the other day.  See him on the cover of the paper.  Well, hold on.  No, nothing.  This is what I've done and I've done it a million times.  What did I do?  You prop act.  He picked up the paper and pointed.  He goes, on the cover of the paper.  On the cover of the paper.  On the cover of the paper.  No. 
[04:09:00]  That should have been Anthony Noe times.  All right.  Here's the wrestler.  Here's the wrestling.  Here's the wrestling fan crying.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  Oh, my God.  It's still real to me, damn it.  I'll be.  Thank you.  Take it easy, man.  Take it easy, man.  Thank you, guys.  You're awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Fuck, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thanks. 
[04:09:30]  There's your fans.  Wow.  There's the fan base.  There's your fan base.  That's why I have three BMWs.  You still have me.  There you go.  Nice perspective.  Yo.  Blubbering horse's ass he was.  It's still real.  Is that real?  Yeah.  Be careful about the money humor around here.  People take it personally.  Oh, some people take it.  Ben will come in.  He'll threaten to punch you.  A lot of people around here only have one BMW.  Hey, Ben.  Ben, Taz is talking about cash.  And I'm like, why are you threatening to punch him in the teeth?  Yeah, why don't you come back and have that same argument you had a few days ago. 
[04:10:00]  Oh, it would be so funny to watch Ben walking around with those big glasses shoved up his asshole.  Can you play the Iron Sheik doing the ID for our show?  Come on, Iraq.  Find it.  Find it.  Find it, Iraq.  The pressure's on.  Look, the whole other room is looking at you.  Twice.  Oh, no, no.  The pressure.  He couldn't take it.  Oh, good thing you don't.  Oh, no.  Point to Dirk.  Dirk, do you have a clue?  He couldn't do it.  Don't you do it.  Good thing you don't work for the Wise Guy Show.  Oh, you're going to be in the middle of the end. 
[04:10:30]  Mingy, mingy.  Mingy.  Mingy.  Mingy.  Mingy.  Mingy.  Mingy.  Mingy.  Mingy.  Why don't we start getting the plugs in so we can get out of here?  Yeah, we try to get a clip on in the back of the door.  Oh, what are you going to do?  This guy's acting like a pack of the water.  Is he?  Is he really?  Is he?  Oh, no.  He's going to see these.  Oh, no.  Stop rifling through your personal collection.  All right.  Oh, we just showed it all. 
[04:11:00]  Paula Abdul.  Madonna.  Hey, did we ever get the Hunter nicknames for his hair?  I think they're on FullBlownNatives.com.  I didn't see it.  No, I'm kidding.  They're on Wackbag.  I just wanted to really annoy them.  Oh, they're on Wackbag.  We have the list there somewhere?  Where's the list of the 100 nicknames for E-Rock?  E-Rock's hair.  He hid it, of course.  We should.  Why?  I bring nothing to the table.  What are you, Rock?  I bring nothing to the table.  His hair is so unusual.  I bring nothing to the table.  We had the listeners come up with a Hunter nickname for his hair. 
[04:11:30]  That's right.  He's busting out that part in the middle, man.  Old-timey bartender head.  Muppet hair head.  Old hellraiser head.  Old handle head.  Old shaving brush head.  Old freight knot melon.  Stay puff marshmallow head.  Pineapple steam head.  Stem.  It says spelt steam.  Not so super cuts head.  Nesting ground for bull weevil's hair.  Ben Sparks starter kit.  Potato stick head. 
[04:12:00]  Wet rooster hairdo.  I like.  Old iron chic boot hair.  This bit isn't going as well as I thought head.  Old Bellagio fountain head.  That's a good one.  Old Bellagio fountain head.  That is funny.  That's a great one.  Flock of sea rock.  Good one.  All right.  Bit's coming back.  Let's go, boys.  We can toilet brush head.  We can save this.  Cram grass head.  I like chimney sweep head.  Phyllis Diller's hangover head.  Old backwards Davy Crockett head. 
[04:12:30]  Let's see.  All right.  That was bad, Joey.  It certainly was.  But I didn't write it.  I just read it.  I just tried to laugh my way through it.  Kid gave her Barbie a haircut head.  All right.  There's a plan.  Something about Mary hair.  There's a plenty.  Old hedgehog head.  Yeah.  We'll have to keep this on file.  Did you find it, E-Rod?  Oh, we got it.  All right.  So here's Iron Sheik.  We just said, dude, just say you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm Iron Sheik.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on whatever, WNEW, whatever it was then. 
[04:13:00]  And that's it.  Right.  And we told Ness what we wanted to do.  That's all we want.  And it was a script.  It was right there.  It doesn't matter.  It should have taken two seconds.  This is what he did.  This is Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time chaplain, All-American AAU chaplain,  a pleasure for me today.  Anthony and Opie bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans.  And everybody knows I'm the real Middle Eastern man.  come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world, Manhattan, Madison,

Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to our talk today. 
[04:14:00]  Opie and Anthony, and pleasure for me always.  I want to know what he said in Iranian.  It was probably something like, Opie and Anthony, Israel shouldn't exist.  World Wrestling Federation.  It's like the fucking world's longest soundbite.  Fuck.  He's nuts, though.  But by the way, he's fucking dangerous, though.  I'm not kidding.  Is he a problem?  Still, even as an older man, he's a dangerous individual.  I just picture, as he was saying that, around the world. 
[04:14:30]  Greatest city in the world, Madison Square Garden.  To my Iranian friends,  Abra-gadala, Abra-gadala, Abra-gadala, Abra-gadala, Abra-gadala, Abra-gadala.  I'm eating balls.

Fucking CBS, man.  Thank you to Tom for paying for the equipment.  That was great.  And to XM.  Mark.  Thank you guys so much for paying for those DVDs tonight.  We're giving out about 200 of my DVDs from HBO's One Night Stand signed.  Opie Anthony will be there.

Rivoli's.  Tom's River.  Amazing food.  It really is.  A huge supporter of the show.  Yes, I know.  He's great.  It didn't go unnoticed, by the way, dude.

It was all about Jimmy Norton.  I could smell her asshole and it was clean and lovely. 
[04:16:30]  That's how much I love you because I was restraining myself.  I know you were.  It was so tough.  And I didn't finish my thank you.  It was so tough.  I have to thank, obviously, Keith and Club Soda.  And I have to thank Big Kev and E-Rock for doing nothing.  And I have to thank Elo and I have to thank Mike.  Well, Elo gave us all the brand new boom boxes.  These brand new portable boom boxes.  They're amazing.  The design is unbelievable.  Thank you, Eric, very much for these signs that have been taken already by our dirty interns.  Yeah.  And I thank Mike.  Fuck.  Who else?  Me.  You forgot me.  I want to thank Taz for not raping me the minute you walked in, which he could have. 
[04:17:00]  Thanks, Rob Bartlett.  Staying over.  No, I know.  But at least I'll have time to shower.  I won't feel dirty.  Taz, it's good to see you.  I mean, now you've been too long, man.  You've got to keep in touch.  I will.  I will.  And again, congrats to you.  I don't want to step on you.  I know you're fucking thanking the whole world.  Relax.  I don't think I'm like Halle Berry on a fucking Oscar.  I know.  Shut up.  You whining bitch.  He'll be back Monday, right?  Are you back on the show here Monday?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So relax.  Relax.  I got to say, one more thing. 
[04:17:30]  Lucky Louie, Sunday night.  1030, HBO.  Give it a few weeks.  If you don't like it, fucking call in and slam me.  Just give it a few episodes.  I think you'll like it.  And I had to thank Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, guys.  No.  All right, fuck you.  I don't accept it.  Come on.  And Jimmy's going to be on Jay Leno next week.  Yeah, next Thursday.  I'm Jay Leno.  Next Thursday.  And I think the show's going to make a pretty cool announcement next week.  I think we're ready to make a pretty cool announcement.  Wow, look at that.  What's the announcement?  That's a nice speculative tease.  What is it for the people?  It's a real announcement, and it's pretty cool.  It's pretty cool. 
[04:18:00]  It's definitely cool.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  And that's all we can say for now, unfortunately.  I want to know.  That's pretty cool.  And it has nothing to do with adding more stations at this time.  No, no.  I don't think it's possible for you guys adding more stations.  We only have 10.  Oh, you're right.  We have 10 or 11 right now.  We're going to go.  That's cool.  You guys deserve it.  I'm happy.  We have more on the burners right now.  Yes, Keith, I see you leaning toward a microphone.  Oh, go ahead, Keith.  Wow, motorcycle run, June 21st.  Coming along very well.  Privileged Night Club has signed on.  The Gentleman's Club is sending a corral of women. 
[04:18:30]  Nice.  We have City Style, Uncle Inky, sending a corral of women as well.  It's going to be June 21st.  Chicks are what makes those things.  When?  Plenty of chicks.  We're doing very well.  Pal Talk sending a bunch of girls.  They're going to represent.  It's June 21st.  We're going to meet downstairs.  Leaving here at 6.30, so be here early.  Right.  If you haven't emailed me already, Keith at FoundryMusic.com.  We're leaving from the other place, all right?  Yeah, we're leaving from the other place.  If you haven't emailed me already, Keith at FoundryMusic.com for some forms and some information.  Get it all together, and it's 10 days from now. 
[04:19:00]  And if you want Keith's attention, just use a girl's name.  Right.  Actually, so he knows it's a motorcycle run, and the subject heading put, open this faggot.  How many of those were?  Is that it?  I hope everyone got their plugs, because the O&A passed.  Thank you.  They came together today.  They're the fucking greatest, man.  General Bam, especially, because I saw his face out there.  No filter, Paul.  Of course.  So, Denise, thank you guys, and all these fucking great listeners.  All right.  Of course, happy time.  Come on to me.  He's still thanking people. 
[04:19:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Why don't you just send everybody a bag of cuddles?  Hey, what do you think you are?  The mayor of a...  Oh!  Oh!  He's walking around like, what do you want from me?  Here's a fucking...  Why don't you all just eat shit?  This weekend, keep your eyes out for a XM commercial that we're part of.  Yeah.  See?  Bitching gets things done.  It's about time.  Nice work.  And Taz, we'll see you soon.  Yeah, we'll be back.  Thanks, Taz.  See you guys.  Have a great weekend, or we'll see you... 
[04:20:00]  See you tonight.  Yeah.  We'll see you tonight at 6, Tower Records, 66th Street, and Broadway.  We're out.  Very good.  The National Board of Health and Lucky Fellow brand suppositories bring you your body and you.  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton.  I'm a perv, and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are sleeping and just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay.  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those 8-decibel shits. 
[04:20:30]  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck?  Like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the face.  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire? 
[04:21:00]  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire?  A quagmire? </pre>
