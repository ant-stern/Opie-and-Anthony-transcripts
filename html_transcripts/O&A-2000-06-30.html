<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a segment titled "Mommy, What Would You Do For Britney Spears Tickets?"  The premise involved soliciting calls from mothers willing to perform outrageous stunts for tickets. While the hosts anticipated more extreme entries, only one mother, "Banana Rose," physically appeared in the studio.  Her initial offer – inserting a banana into her exhaust pipe – proved underwhelming, leading to considerable frustration and comedic bickering between Opie and Anthony.  Their disappointment fueled a rapid escalation of increasingly absurd stunt suggestions, culminating in a challenge involving Rose launching a bottle rocket from her vagina using a custom-made plexiglass shield.  Despite initial hesitation, Anthony ultimately agreed to provide Rose with Britney Spears tickets and a limo ride upon successful completion.  The show then detailed preparations for the stunt, mentioning safety measures like a fire extinguisher and a garbage pail.  The stunt was successfully executed, with the bottle rocket striking a cardboard cutout of El Duque.  The segment concluded with celebratory remarks from the hosts and the fulfillment of Rose's prize, solidifying her status as a memorable guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Stupid.  The award-winning Kofi and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people.  Hey, geeky, geeky.  W-N-E-W.  All right, Anthony, we've heard that a few mommies are on the way to try to win the Britney Spears tickets.  Really? Yeah, finally.  We're going to definitely play mommy.  What would you do for Britney Spears tickets today?  We've got a few of the mommies coming down, okay? 
[00:00:30]  Which ones do we have?  We've got the banana lady, we've got the watermelon lady, and we've got the mother-daughter diaper-changing team, Anthony.  The mother-daughter diaper.  That's the one I'm looking for.  Yeah, the mother changing a diaper on an 18-year-old girl.  Yes, that just happens to be her daughter.  Yes.  What's up, Rick?  Banana Rose is here.  Banana Rose!  Okay, I think she should do her stunt.  That's it.  Just the banana check.  After all the stuff that we had going on. 
[00:01:00]  That's the one you didn't want.  Remember playing grab bag in school when they bring in the presents and you got the lousiest grab bag in there?  You got the chia pad or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, great.  This is definitely, oh, thanks, a pen.  Oh, it's a cross pen.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't care what kind of pen it is.  It's a pen.  We had all these mommies calling the last few days to try to win the Britney Spears tickets.  We had some stuff that, queefs, hummers that were just going to be given out by 18-year-old crack whores.  Right. 
[00:01:30]  I don't know.  Oh, look, Crayola crayons.  Not even the big box with the sharpener on the side.  No.  We had anal that was going to go on in this studio.  So what do we end up with?  The banana lady.  Okay.  It's, you know, it's not bad.  But we had asparagus going in the back door a little while back, I remember.  So how are we going to get excited over this?  Wiffle ball bats.  We were tossing cherries into the leather Cheerio no more than a week ago. 
[00:02:00]  So banana chips showed up.  Great.  I'm just thrilled to death.  Wait a minute.  I turned down a hummer from a crack whore.  Right.  All right.  Let's meet Rose.  Yeah, let's bring her in.  This is great.  Oh, I bet this even gets better, LP.  Let's bring her in.  Let's see how much better the banana gig gets.  Now, you've got to apologize to Rose.  No, I'm not in an apologetic mood today.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  I could give a quiet out. 
[00:02:30]  What are you pissed at?  I'm not pissed.  You know, the Tommy thing set me off.  And then we're disappointed now that our mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  Yeah, I'm a little disappointed.  I'm a little disappointed.  Nothing personal.  I swear to you.  I at least showed up.  Nothing personal.  But I was hoping for a mother-daughter diaper change, a mother-daughter queefing, a mother-daughter make-out session.  Instead, you know, oh, the banana in the tailpipe routine.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  You know, I don't know. 
[00:03:00]  It's cold and all, but yeah, maybe I just need a drink.  Hey, I at least started it off.  No, like I said, nothing personal.  But it's like, oh, okay.  Oh, the banana.  Wow.  Out of all the things we had, it was the banana.  You know what I mean?  It's like scratching off the lotto ticket.  No, I won a buck.  Hey, I won.  I won.  But it's a dollar.  I know I'm just going to go in the store, get another ticket, and it'll be a loser. 
[00:03:30]  So, you know, this is the equivalent of the $1 lottery ticket.  I'm sorry.  I don't have to do it.  Do you want me to leave?  You know something?  Yeah.  No!  Okay.  Did you just get up?  No, no, no, no.  Just leave.  That means we'll have to do as fast as we can review, dude.  What's worse at this point?  Truthfully, bring on Spaz.  Rose, thank you.  I've never seen Ed act like this, Rose. 
[00:04:00]  You need a beer, man.  You need a C, Bruce.  Look, I'm teasing, of course.  What about a margarita?  No.  You need a margarita?  Of course.  Of course I'm joking.  Of course.  We are all looking forward to seeing you jam a banana up there.  Can I say...  Oh, now she's getting all pissed.  Opie, what did you do to our guest?  You got her all anxious.  No, I'm usually the one, but today it's you.  I'm very surprised. 
[00:04:30]  Rose, I'm the sweetheart.  That's the a-hole over there.  Yeah.  Today.  These roles can change during the show or every other show.  Stay tuned.  I was really looking forward to the diaper changes.  I'm sorry.  Don't do enough of that at home.  I swear, I'm sorry.  I didn't say I was going to put it in.  No matter what happens, it has nothing to do with you personally.  It is just the talent that you have and what you want to do on the show isn't quite what  I thought we would be seeing.  I thought...  I'm sorry. 
[00:05:00]  I thought it would be like a warm-up.  I'm the only one that showed up.  You know something?  You go to see a band that you like, you know, if you want to go see STP, right?  And the warm-up band comes on.  You know, you would never go see that warm-up band, right?  Depends who's playing.  But since they're...  Well, usually, you wouldn't just go out and out of your way to go see it.  What if it's like Godsmack?  Well, that would be cool.  But it's not Godsmack.  We're talking Zebra.  Ah!  You know?  Come on, man.  Like, if Zebra's warming up for STP, right? 
[00:05:30]  You would watch Zebra and go, okay, I'm watching Zebra.  I'm waiting for STP.  Right.  But Zebra on its own is like, huh.  Well, Ed, let's let Zebra perform, and maybe, just maybe, STP will show up.  You know nothing new is going to happen.  No, no.  It's going to be who's behind the door.  It's going to be all the same old Zebra tunes again.  And it's just Zebra.  We've seen Zebra a thousand times.  But Scott Whalen's off the H, so he might get out of the hotel room and show up.  STP is not showing up. 
[00:06:00]  Today.  We're stuck with Zebra.  Zebra.  Wow.  Not even all of Zebra.  Just the singer doing an acoustic set.  I don't know.  Maybe we're just getting jaded.  Maybe I'm being a little harsh.  I understand.  Tell me what you want.  I love when they do it.  See, this is what we got today.  Oh. 
[00:06:30]  Is it skipping?  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  Hey, Rose, can I have that banana?  Okay?  Throw it over here.  Throw it over here.  He just threw the banana.  Don't break the banana.  She's got to use it.  You can't even hit the turntable with the banana.  Give me something. 
[00:07:00]  Aw.  There's always something around when we need to throw it.  You can't hit it.  You suck.  Oh, that did it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Give me that.  Oh, no.  Give me that final.  The precious.  Hey, it still works.  No, no, no. 
[00:07:30]  The big, no, no.  Stop it.  He just threw the Zebra album like a Frisbee.  It nearly missed.  Just missed my head.  You missed the spot.  Now it's in many pieces.  Don't give it back to him.  Oh, no.  Mark's got the big, the bruiser Gallagher hammer.  Oh, man.  There it goes.  It's already flat as a pancake.  The mouth doesn't work on that.  It's breaking it to pieces, though.  See, that's what we got.  Look, she's so depressed.  Rose, please, please do not take this personally.  It is just your act that I have a problem with today. 
[00:08:00]  I'm so sorry.  Could you juice up your act, you think?  Juice it up?  Yeah, like eat the banana afterwards or something?  Sure, why not?  All right, listen.  Ant, what if...  Here's my hairy yellow butt.  Ant, what if Rose did the banana trick...  Yeah.  ...and then went for the wiffle ball bat record?  I don't know about that.  We'd have a winner, right?  That would definitely improve things.  So, Ant, let me save the show. 
[00:08:30]  So, Rose, you got this banana trick for the Britney Spears tickets and the limo ride, right?  Yeah.  Are you willing to do anything else?  Sure, it depends.  What if I could guarantee you the tickets?  I'll guarantee!  If you decide to do what I'm about to put forth...  A vagina match!  We will give you three Britney Spears tickets and a limo ride.  Guaranteed?  Now, Opie has not even...  At this point...  ...insulted with his partner, Anthony, here. 
[00:09:00]  At this point, I...  Let me speak for the team today.  Okay, I have no problem with that.  Okay.  You have power of attorney today.  I will guarantee her the tickets, and if there's any other mommies on the way, they lose.  Wow.  That's a bold statement.  I got a patriotic theme.  Patriotic.  Have you ever had anything else in your...  No.  No.  Yeah.  And you want these tickets really bad?  Yeah.  Steve, where's your...  Where's your stuff?  I forgot.  Okay. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  That's good.  What if we could put one of these...  And, you know, let it go.  Let it go.  Well, you know, there's a chance I might get burnt.  What she would need.  I could almost see this working.  You're going to help me out now?  You're going to help save the show?  Listen to you.  Shut up.  Yeah.  I'm going to help save the show.  I'm going to help save her...  ...is what I'm going to help. 
[00:10:00]  Okay.  What it would need is some sort of a shield.  Correct.  To protect from any thrust.  No, you can't use that.  I've got the shield right here.  And then where would...  Look.  ...the stick go?  My God, look.  And...  Ta-da.  Like that.  Yeah.  And it would be...  Like that.  Oh, my God.  That would work.  Okay, look.  If you can make that happen...  Yeah.  Fine.  I'm with it. 
[00:10:30]  Anthony, finish up that Bud Light bottle.  Oh, my God.  Never done on radio before.  I'm trying to figure out the safest way this can be done.  And...  Look.  Okay.  You show me.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Opie's in the spread eagle position.  Give me the shield.  Give him the shield.  Give him the shield.  All right.  It's a plexiglass shield with a small hole drilled in it.  Turn off the camera. 
[00:11:00]  No.  Keep the camera.  Okay.  Let's see.  Now, a bottle will go in a certain place.  Yes.  Then, the shield will go over the bottle.  Point.  It's...  That goes in the hole.  It's in.  Holy mother of pearl, that might just work.  I'm telling you.  I'm saving the show up.  Oh, my God.  You're definitely coughing up some cash.  Look.  You're like...  What's his name?  Robert Goddard.  The father of rocketry.  Only different. 
[00:11:30]  What do you think, Ash?  Yeah.  I'm for it.  But you don't got to sell me, pal.  I'm the easy one to sell.  Right here.  What do you say, Rose?  Wow.  It would be game over.  I'm guaranteed the tickets.  Guaranteed the tickets and a limo ride.  Plus, you will be known...  How's that?  You will be known for doing this forever.  When we introduce you at road shows, the place will go nuts.  You will be an O&A celebrity. 
[00:12:00]  Where did you get this?  It's a $50 American Express traveler's check that Anthony, the limo driver, is giving up for this?  All right, Anthony.  Okay.  That's 50 bucks.  50 bucks.  Plus the Britney Spears tickets.  Plus a limo ride.  A limo ride.  What do you think?  All right.  Sure.  Let's go for it.  Where are we going to do this?  Right out there, man.  Oh, my God.  I mean, you guys have put me on the spot.  How can I see that?  Let me see that.  Let me see those. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Uh-huh.  Whistling meteor with white and report.  Yes, they will make a sound.  Well, this is totally against the rules of this thing.  Place on ground, light fuse, get away.  It says nothing about placing it anywhere else.  And, yes, she will be known as the Stone Temple Pilots, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, at this point, after this.  Outdoor use only.  Yes.  Place in wooden trough.  Oh, or pipe.  Well, that could qualify.  At 75 degree angle, pointing away from people.  It will be pointing away.  Do not hold in hand.  It's not a hand.  Light fuse, get away.  We could do that.  I think it might work.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Place in tube.  Fallopian.  I do believe this will save our radio show today.  All right.  Well, she's into it.  But now we got to take some precautions here.  I'm saying.  What I'm saying.  What?  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  We do this.  Right?  When this thing flies, it's going to bounce off some walls.  Someone could get hurt with a ricochet.  And then it's going to explode at the end.  A little firecracker type pop.  Not like that.  Or that.  Oh, my God.  Kowalski, I'm hit. 
[00:14:30]  What do you say?  How are we going to keep the fire extinguisher?  Great.  There you go.  That's, you know something?  It.  That's the old rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  Because if you get to the point where you need a fire extinguisher,  someone's already been injured in the close quarters that we want to do this in.  And we can't do it out on the courtyard.  No.  Okay. 
[00:15:00]  I got an idea.  I got an idea.  I got an idea.  I got an idea.  I'll try to aim for something.  No.  Here we go.  I got an idea.  I don't know how viable this is.  Somebody has to stand in front of you with a garbage pail.  So it fires directly into the garbage pail and explodes in the pail.  So catch it in the pail.  Ram it onto the floor upside down.  Boom.  It explodes.  This is very tricky.  You know what?  This is like a shuttle launch. 
[00:15:30]  How complicated this is.  How complicated this is.  And she's game for it.  You will be the winner of the Mommy What Would You Do for Britney Spears ticket.  And it's a whole theme thing with 4th of July coming up.  This is great.  I've never seen anything like this before. 
[00:16:00]  I'm feeling much better about this.  I'm so happy.  And can we put a sparkler in your pooper?  No, huh?  No.  All right.  All right.  Let's do it.  All right.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on.  The cars have passed.  Okay.  What the hell are we waiting for?  Yeah.  Let's do this.  This is something now, folks.  All right.  Let's move to the other marks. 
[00:16:30]  Okay.  We're moving to the launch pad.  The launch pad area.  Walter Cronkite, I'm here.  It's wonderful that we're seeing another launch of this.  All right.  We need Psycho Mark down the hallway just in case there's a mishap.  I feel like we're setting up like an Evil Knievel jump or something here.  Yeah.  A lot of planning going into this one.  This could be live on Fox.  Yeah.  Like, go into, like, the cubbyhole to the left there just in case there's any problems.  What?  He's going back there with the fire extinguisher?  Yeah.  I don't foresee any problems, Anthony, but just in case. 
[00:17:00]  Just in case.  We have to have our safety team here.  We want to cover all our bases.  Okay.  Where's Rose?  What is actually going to be?  Oh, my God.  What?  Any type of bottle?  Really?  Wait.  You can accommodate that, huh?  Oh, wow.  So then she'll definitely be protected.  Oh, this is great.  Okay.  This is getting better by the moment.  Come on.  I can't believe you can accommodate that.  Where's your husband?  Have you been with any black men? 
[00:17:30]  Where's your husband?  No?  Watch it.  Yeah, look.  Jamaican Mike is here.  He's saying, ah, that beer bottle is nothing, man.  And talk to her husband.  Rose is more like a keg.  Rose is husband.  Rose is husband.  What's your name, man?  Ralph.  Ralph, do you think she can accommodate that beer bottle?  Yeah, I think she can.  Now, you know we're talking this way, so the opening is sticking out.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get down to business.  All right.  Do you have any worries about what she's going to do? 
[00:18:00]  No, not really.  She knows what she's doing.  She's a big girl.  She knows what she's doing.  She's a big girl.  Okay, we have everything set up.  I believe so.  All we need is the rocket launcher, as they say.  Yes.  To remove the pants.  Have her sit down right here.  Sit down here.  Oh, my God.  You see this?  Rose, you see this line right here?  Yeah.  Line up your butt right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, give her a nice cushion.  Oh, we got pillows.  Of course, yeah.  This is great.  We're here looking at the launch gantry here at the Kennedy Space Center. 
[00:18:30]  And she brought something with you.  Rose, what are you putting on the bottle?  KY.  KY.  Whoa, look at that.  There it goes.  Very good.  Anthony, Rose is in position.  Rose, take off your pants.  Wow.  She is...  Is it working?  That's a tight squeeze.  Hey, let me get the field mic on.  Work the area.  Rose, how's it going?  I'm trying. 
[00:19:00]  She's what?  Trying.  She's trying.  Wow.  This is huge.  It's huge, yes.  Yeah, relax.  Breathe.  Breathe.  Jamaican mic is like, ha-ha, what an amateur.  If you spend a week in Jamaica, you can do a keg of beer, never mind a bottle.  Wow.  That's a tough fit.  All right, how are we doing down there, Rose?  Wow.  Okay.  That's good.  Boy, you know, when they get these depositable bottles back, you just never know when you're 
[00:19:30]  popping a bud where that bottle's been.  And at this point, it looks like she's giving a bottle.  Yeah.  All right.  Rose, I think you're ready, huh?  Oh, yeah.  You got it.  Oh, yeah.  There we go.  Oh, okay.  I just saw it.  Look, I just saw it go.  Yeah, that was...  Right?  Okay.  There we go.  All right, that way.  Now we're talking.  All right, and I got the heat shield.  You got the heat shield.  Make sure the heat...  Oh, my God.  Okay, the launch pad is ready.  You can hold that a little back behind. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, like that.  You're going to have to...  You hold it.  There you go.  The heat shield in place, Anthony.  Make sure it doesn't jam up in there, Opie.  It can't jam.  The heat shield's got to be more at a 90-degree angle.  Yeah, like that.  Oh, yeah.  That's going into the ceiling, though.  Wait, wait, wait.  We got to angle the heat shield better.  Don't move, Rose.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Now, Rick, get the heat shield in place.  Okay.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  That's how it's got to go.  All right.  It's perfect.  All right, someone's got to hold the heat shield in place. 
[00:20:30]  Anthony, I'm going to parade the missile around the station a little bit like the Russians do.  Like the Russians did, yeah.  All right.  Oh, this is working perfectly now.  This is good.  All right, Anthony, that's perfect.  All right, hold on.  That's perfect.  All right, hold on.  I got to get behind her and make sure she's got it aimed right.  Are we aiming at El Duque?  Okay.  All right, move.  Very steady.  Move the missile out a little bit so we can light it. 
[00:21:00]  You can light it.  Okay, very good.  This baby is clear.  Psychomark is downrange.  All right, Psychomark is downrange.  She is hiding behind El Duque, the big, giant, life-size cardboard cutout of El Duque.  We're firing a bottle rocket at a black eye.  Isn't that a...  Hey, stop it.  Opie, if you would please give me the lighter.  Okay.  Yes.  Clear the range. 
[00:21:30]  Clear the range.  What a great moment in radio this is.  And fire in the hole.  Let's go.  Fire in the hole, and that's never been more appropriate than it is right now.  Ready?  Don't move.  Here it goes.  Look out, Rick.  And...  We're lit.  We're lit.  We're lit.  Oh, my God.  And...  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:00]  It was beautiful.  It was beautiful.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She fired a bottle rocket out of her most intimate of areas.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  We have a go, Mission Control.  Holy cow!  Wow!  The vehicle has left the...  Wow! 
[00:22:30]  Holy cow!  Steve got that on tape, Anthony.  Steve got that on tape.  It's going to be on the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Foundrymusic.com.  I've got to switch the other microphone.  Oh, my God.  What a great moment in this country's history.  And I do mean country.  Oh, my God.  I was getting a little worried when the fuse burnt down and it wasn't going anywhere. 
[00:23:00]  Because I thought we were going to have one of those short rounds where it just explodes where it is.  You've seen those, right?  You put it in the bottle.  You light it.  And it just blows up.  Rose, I've got to say.  Fantastic.  No.  No, you can take that.  Thank you.  Get Rose on mic.  Get Rose on mic.  Get her some headphones.  Wow.  Another crowning.  Our newest American hero.  Another crowning in radio history. 
[00:23:30]  I'm proud to be an American, Anthony.  I don't know about you.  Yeah.  That's what the 4th of July is all about.  Launching fireworks out of women's intimates.  Yes.  Wow.  The people still on their feet.  What an ovation.  What an ovation.  I was getting a little nervous when that fuse burnt down.  Now, here it is.  No, I'm not going to touch it.  No. 
[00:24:00]  Psycho Mark.  Where did that hit?  I think it hit El Duque.  It was a perfect shot.  It hit El Duque in the foot.  There she is, Rose, with the rocket in her hand now.  We're taking pictures.  It was the press taking pictures when it finally lit up and took off out of the launch pad,  I guess you could call it, the crowd on their feet here at Mission Control.  Mission Control.  There's El Duque.  Can we see the heat shield? 
[00:24:30]  I want to see the heat shield.  Yeah, see the heat shield because now the other jocks got to use it for a copy, a little board.  How is it?  Let me see the heat shield.  Yes, it does have a burn mark on it.  It is scorched.  That saved her most intimate of areas from getting burned.  Wow.  Look at that heat shield.  Wow, let me see that.  Now, that should be a competition on Survivor,  trying to figure out how to launch something out of there without hurting the woman.  Look at that. 
[00:25:00]  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Play it, Jimmy.  Play it, Jimmy.  Play it, Jimmy.  Happy Fourth of July, everybody. 
[00:25:30]  Happy Fourth of July to you.  Rose is STP.  Yeah.  You went from zebra to STP.  Yes, yes.  I can't believe that worked.  Well, we have a winner for the Britney Spears tickets.  Yeah, yeah.  Mom, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  And firing illegal fireworks from the v***** is what she came up with when we did. 
[00:26:00]  Kind of coerced into it, weren't you?  Yes.  But she did it.  Fabulous.  All right, let's hear it for Rose and her husband.  Wow.  Great.  Thank you.  Stars of the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  Yes.  And we'll be back.  Who did it?  Oh, and I wrote.  Conquer us, you bastards.
