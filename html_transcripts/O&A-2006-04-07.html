<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the usual playful banter amongst the hosts, referencing Hawk's mistakes and Ben's illness.  Drew Boogie served as the in-studio DJ.  Their disorganization was a running theme, punctuated by Jimmy Norton's anecdote about a frustrating bar stool delivery, where the delivery person asked "Who's Ramone?", referencing a past prank call.  A significant portion of the show was consumed by a caller's 9/11 conspiracy theories, met with counterarguments and evidence supporting the official narrative from the hosts and other callers.  This discussion involved detailed analysis of reports, evidence, and eyewitness accounts.

The show then transitioned to a scathing critique of a Time Out Magazine article criticizing comedians for using rape and misogynistic jokes. Jimmy Norton, particularly, expressed outrage at the author, Jane Borden, and her subjective assessment of humor.  The hosts debated the boundaries of acceptable humor, touching upon the use of offensive language and the difference between cruel humor and humor stemming from personal experience.  The discussion on the subjectivity of humor and audience sensitivities continued into a discussion about Jimmy Norton telling an abortion joke at Pace University and the negative reaction he received.  The hosts debated using humor to address sensitive topics like violence against women.  A caller referenced the South Park episode about Muhammad.

A phone interview with Frank Vincent followed, promoting his book, *A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man*, and discussing his career, including *Goodfellas*, *Raging Bull*, and *Casino*. He also touched upon the secrecy surrounding *The Sopranos*.  This was followed by a call from Lori, a gang rape survivor, who recounted her experience and the inadequate legal response.  This led to a heated debate with a caller, Julie, who questioned Lori's decision to discuss her trauma publicly. Lori defended her actions, explaining her coping mechanism. Other callers shared similar experiences and coping strategies. Anthony angrily addressed negative comments from PalTalk users about Lori's story, banning several users.  The hosts reflected on the unexpected emotional turn of the show.  A new Ramon promotional bit was mentioned, followed by concluding humorous banter.

The show further covered Rosie O'Donnell, her coming out, outspoken views on Michael Jackson and gun control, and the perceived bias in her opinions.  The hosts debated the use of sensitive topics like cancer in comedy, even if based on personal experience.  A caller shared a story about a short man with a hammer, leading to the "Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day" bit. Another caller recounted a rape story, prompting a darkly humorous exchange.  A substantial portion focused on mocking Tyra Banks' behavior on *America's Next Top Model*, using audio clips of her perceived egotism, including a staged fainting episode.  They also dissected clips from her phobia show, focusing on her contrived fear of dolphins and her approach to other guests' phobias.  The segment included disparaging remarks about Tyra and caller interactions with more offensive humor.

A game show segment about finding a garden gnome with Tyra Banks' logo was discussed, criticizing Tyraâ€™s condescending demeanor.  A caller, Ashley, revealed her fear of ovens, leading to a staged segment (criticized for poor production quality) where she confronted her fear with the help of the staff.  The prize was a trip to Miami.  The show featured other callers discussing their phobias.  Dr. Ian Smith, author of "The Fat Smash Diet," was a guest, discussing his book, weight loss, Celebrity Fit Club (mentioning Kelly LeBrock and upcoming guests), and listener questions. This portion included sexually suggestive and offensive comments about women, weight loss, and celebrities.  Jimmy Norton promoted his upcoming shows and "wow" stickers, and Drew Boogie performed a musical segment. Bob Kelly's fear of treadmills was mentioned.

Finally, the show discussed Celebrity Fit Club 4 participants (Nick Turturro, Carney Wilson, Bone Crusher, Angie Stone), promoted Dr. Ian Smith's and Frank Vincent's books, and Opie promoted his stand-up shows with David Tell. The show concluded with compliments to Dr. Smith and Drew Boogie, followed by playful banter and the sign-off.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We love when Hawk fucks up. 
[00:04:30]  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  That's funny. 
[00:05:00]  That's funny. I'm funny.  That's funny. I'm funny.  That's funny.  That's funny. I'm funny.  I'm funny.  I'm funny.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:05:30]  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  We're showing our diversity today.  We're showing our diversity today.  Is that what we're doing?  It's diversity day.  Actually, yesterday, we talked about heavy metal music for like an hour.  Yeah.  And now today, we bring it into the inner city for everybody. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  Right.  We got Drew Boogie scratching live on our program once again.  He was supposed to do this before he went on vacation, but he overslept.  Overslept.  Oh, this is like a make good.  Come on.  Typical.  Oh, DJ.  Typical.  Jesus.  Okay.  Please.  Typical.  No.  So, what's in the headlines today?  I wouldn't know.  Why? 
[00:06:30]  Why?  Why?  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Problem?  Nah.  Oh, no.  Not at all.  Oh, no.  What?  Wait.  I don't get it.  Nothing.  Oh, okay.  He doesn't have any newspapers.  What's in the headlines today?  I don't know.  The boys are a little disorganized today.  Ben's under the weather.  He's just kind of sweating profusely at his desk.  That could be any day of the week for Ben.  That's true.  Rock is like the one-man wrecking crew trying to get everything done in the studio. 
[00:07:00]  Wrecking crew is a good way to put it.  Yes, that's why I said that.  Anything that might be constructive is just torn down.  And, yeah, I didn't even notice.  I came running in here, me and Jimmy.  We're continuing our 9-11 debate in the office, and I'm hearing the music starts.  Ecstasy of gold.  I look and go, oh, it's 7 o'clock.  Perhaps I should step into the studio.  Yeah, so you guys are bonding, and I'm like...  We just don't stop.  You two are bonding about that, and I'm like, hey, did anyone see the Tyra Banks show yesterday?  Tyra Banks?  She's crazy. 
[00:07:30]  She's a lunatic.  That woman's insane.  Which she is.  Yeah, we got some great audio, actually.  It will be very entertaining.  I got to, just before we go, because I'm in a good mood today.  Actually, I'm a little tired, but I relaxed yesterday on my new bar stools.  Oh, congratulations, Jimmy.  Don't congratulate me.  Why?  Congratulate the listeners.  Oh, yeah.  The old O&A pest got something done for Jimmy.  Beyond belief.  And please, don't call the chair, people. 
[00:08:00]  I almost felt bad.  The guy, the owner's son, you guys know my bar stools weren't coming.  I thought I was being mistreated.  I was very angry.  Yes.  I finally got the guy on the phone.  It's the owner's son.  He goes, look, I was out of the country.  Remember I told you the fabric was going to take a couple weeks?  I'm like, yeah.  He's like, well, they came.  They were in the warehouse, but I had to reupholster them.  And they shouldn't have told you that they were there because they weren't ready to be  picked up yet.  So the times of the guy saying like, yeah, they're here.  The guy's like, I hadn't come back and reupholstered them yet.  They weren't ready for you. 
[00:08:30]  But they didn't know that.  I actually believed him because he was a nice dude.  So you're not supposed to write checks.  You're supposed to only like go in and swipe credit cards.  He's like, I'll bring them to you.  He was getting so assaulted.  He brought them to you.  The owner's son had to bring me bar stools in his car.  And he goes, I'm like, should I write you a check?  He's like, just do what you want.  I don't care.  Just do what you want.  Just call off your dogs.  Dude, I swear to God.  Just take the bar stools.  Dude, he shows up.  There's two bar stools in front of my apartment and he's standing there.  And we say, hello. 
[00:09:00]  And he goes, who's Ramone?  He did not.  It's the first thing he said to me.  Ramone.  Oh, why don't you take Jimmy's bar stools, turn them upside down, and invite over three  friends.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Ramone.  That first day I heard, just cause Neo doesn't change his, there's a guy named Neo on Paltalk  who doesn't change his voice.  Yeah.  There's Ramone.  Let me see what's going on.  Ramone.  Ramone. 
[00:09:30]  And it's just the same guy just saying Ramone.  And these awful calls were being made and it just ruined their business.  Oh, was that hysterical.  Pests.  Dude, I really wanted to laugh in his face when he said, who's Ramone?  Oh, that is.  How do you explain that?  That is wonderful.  So thank you guys very, very much, but please give them a break.  The guys have beaten.  He was a defeated man.  I saw a raped man.  Bravo.  Bravo to the pet.  Good.  Mission accomplished.  We will not be ignored.  Amazing.  I won't be ignored, Dan. 
[00:10:00]  Like that bar stool.  Let's go to John in Utah.  John.  Hey, you guys have had such an awesome week.  I think you guys should just coast today.  All right.  I like this guy's advice.  First of all, we've only worked three days this week so far.  Yeah.  We have had a really good week of radio, which means we're going to stink on ice today.  It's just how it works with us.  It has worked every dime I've spent on XM just on this week.  You know, we're like...  All right. 
[00:10:30]  Punch it out.  Thank you, John.  We're kind of like awakenings with the dopamine.  Like if you get three or four good days in a row, just be grateful and you know a shitty  day is coming.  No one's coming.  Well, Jimmy Norton's in the news today too, Anthony.  I saw that.  Not that I cared about little Jimmy Norton, but I saw Opie and Anthony in Google News.  It was embarrassing.  And had to look.  And there it is, our pal Jimmy.  So you walked in to have a conversation with a 13-year-old.  I love the headline because it says, Jim Norton of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:11:00]  Why can't you just get your own headline every once in a while?  That's fine.  That's how I would put it.  Why?  Because realistically, this show is my...  This is my base.  This is my...  Your bread and butter.  Ooh.  I never would have thought of that.  Yeah, I made it up.  I would have said my low-carb pita.  LOL.  Give me those ribs, Drew.  Oh.  Yeah.  I got to back up just slightly because Evil Trucker has a very good idea out of Dallas.  Evil Trucker, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, fancy men?  Also known as Max.  What's up, Max? 
[00:11:30]  Hey, bud.  Hey, I was wondering, man, we ought to make some money renting the pests out.  Can you imagine?  What an idea.  Someone has a problem like Jimmy did with a furniture company or I did with a car company  or anything like that, and we rent out the pests to do some virtual leg breaking and get  the problem solved.  Can you imagine?  My ex-wife works for a judge and she keeps bugging the fuck out of me, calling me?  How many Ramones would their judge love to hear? 
[00:12:00]  Well, that could be a problem.  Yeah, that's good, sir.  Why don't we just hire them to murder people?  What's the matter with you?  Right.  You call the judge.  Murder, Inc.  Yeah.  Hey, pest, go after the federal judge.  Do that.  That's smart.  I like your idea.  You know, somebody's not getting a delivery, has a problem with a company.  Why don't we start slow with like maybe the local party planner that didn't have enough  balloons for the kids' party.  How about we not go right out to a judge and maybe start with Levitt's or something like  that.  Ramone, unroll my carpet.  There you go. 
[00:12:30]  There you go.  Hey, Anthony, I gotta thank you because I got the divorce based on your story and I wound  up coming out on top, dude.  So, thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  Robbo, did you take some of that advice and take the money out of the bank?  Oh, hell yeah, man.  Yeah.  You wound up losing a $35,000 GMC loaded out Envoy.  That's what I'm driving right now.  You know, I almost feel like the pain I went through is worth it because I helped some people  out there like Evil Trucker.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  You rule, Ed.  I know.  All right.  Thank you.  Ed in Connecticut.  Ed.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Hey, Eddie.  Hey, listen.  Real quick.  I heard Anthony mention this morning in passing that him and Jimmy were arguing this morning  about 9-11.  We weren't arguing this morning.  No, we were pretty much just talking.  Yeah, discussing.  Yeah, and the other night I was listening, or last night I was listening to the replay  and Jimmy mentioned that he agreed with some of the shit that Crackpot was saying.  No, no, no.  Well, dude, what I said was some of it made sense and I didn't have enough technical expertise 
[00:13:30]  to refute it.  Okay.  Dude, hold on.  I figured there was a rational explanation for it, but I'm not going to pretend I know  the answer.  The answer is much better at stuff like that.  Like, there were certain things in the towers that fell, like these little lights going  off.  And I'm like, all right, what is that?  And he made a great point about how it's air being compressed from the pressure.  Okay.  I wouldn't have thought of that.  So not what I did.  Shooting out of ducts that run up the side of the building, shooting out windows, weak  points.  And yeah, it's like a piston moving down a cylinder. 
[00:14:00]  It's not just going to come out of the top.  It's going to come out of any weak point down the cylinder.  And that's what those little puffs were.  I did a lot of research.  I don't just go home after an argument like on the air yesterday.  I did research.  I sat down and read the government's 9-11 report that came out.  Jesus.  I read through it.  First of all, let me tell you something.  How many pages was that?  It's like 519 pages.  I watched this.  And then footnotes. 
[00:14:30]  I watched the second half of the Heavy Metal movie.  Did you watch that?  And I thought I was doing some heavy lifting.  I jerked off in pal talk.  I mean, what the?  Let me recommend the 9-11 Commission's report.  It is great reading.  Even if you just read the first chapter, it shows the whole setup.  And it really, the evidence there, the paper trail that they left is overwhelming.  The logic in how this was carried out and handled by these terrorists, by the upper echelon, 
[00:15:00]  the financing where it came from, the testimony of security, cameras, the people at the airport,  the FAA, air traffic controllers, crew members that called, family members that listened to the call.  There's so much shit, evidence that is completely contrary to what that guy was saying yesterday.  Yeah, of course.  Nothing found at the Pentagon.  There are photos of a fireman standing next to a hole in the Pentagon that is called this small hole.  How did the nose make this?  It's a blowout hole the fireman made for access.  Right. 
[00:15:30]  Nothing to do with the plane.  Laying next to it is a landing gear hub.  They compare it.  It's a perfect picture of it, too.  With the landing gear hub of a 757, it matches perfectly with that.  Obviously, a 757 hit.  Yeah, I just want to make sure Jimmy wasn't buying any of that bullshit.  No, no, no.  I'm sorry.  Jimmy's a smart guy.  We just needed more information to refute the bullshit artist.  Yeah, when you have somebody, like when you watch the documentary and they're raising certain points of physics and stuff,  even though it sounds good and it may be bullshit, I just didn't have the expertise to refute it because I just, 
[00:16:00]  I could have refuted it going, look, you're a crackpot in a jizz bucket and you're walking around.  The guy walks around, this guy Corey Rowe.  I think there's a picture of him wearing a shirt that said, 9-11 investigation.  Yeah, man.  You're like, oh, wait, whatever happened to Corey?  Haven't you heard?  Haven't you heard?  Don't you know what he's been doing?  All right, Ed.  You mean that Corey that I thought would never be, yeah, he's the guy that solved it. 
[00:16:30]  You're reading the report from 1996 until the actual event on 9-11.  It would make, that's what they should make a movie of.  And then, you know, stop it right at the attacks.  They did actually.  Did they?  Yeah.  From 96 on, because that is some fascinating shit, the way it was coordinated between these animals,  how they actually gained entry to flight lessons, how horrible a lot of them were at flying, how the flight instructors were suspicious, how we came so close. 
[00:17:00]  Just a couple of, you're reading it, knowing how it ends, which pisses you off.  And it's just like, God, if this guy just would have spoke up more.  Or if these two would have hooked up and traded info.  Or if this guy, this agent could have traded information with another agency.  Like something might have crumbled in the plan, but it all just went.  Do you know nine out of the ten American airline hijackers were picked out of the security line before they boarded by a computer program that picks up threats to civil aviation? 
[00:17:30]  But all that happened when this program was tripped is that your luggage, your checked luggage was kept off the plane until they made sure you were on the plane.  So you couldn't load a bomb and get off the plane.  They wanted to make sure you were on.  But nine of the hijackers, ten of which were on American Airlines, were screened, were pulled off and pulled aside and kept off until they made sure that their bags were kept off until they made sure they were on. 
[00:18:00]  And a couple of them were stopped at security checkpoints too.  Stopped at security.  Mohamed Atta went to Maine to take the flight back and was pissed off because they made him go through security again.  Usually when you get a transfer flight, you don't go through security again.  You just go to your flight, your connecting flight.  They made him go through security again.  He was pissed off at it.  And, you know, boom, in this day and age, you're pulled aside, you know, things happen.  Security was so lax and like there were so many things.  You read through this, it's really fascinating reading. 
[00:18:30]  And that's why you have to love the fact that when they were doing profiling here, and again, there's a way to do it, but you're taught in this stupid politically correct mentality.  Hey, you know, everyone, really?  We know who's doing these things.  And when you want to pull them aside and talk to them, you have to justify it and pull aside a fat white lady too and a grandmother just so nobody's feelings get hurt.  The terrorist that day didn't have a photograph, didn't have photo ID and couldn't speak English. 
[00:19:00]  And one of the security people pulled him aside, talked to them, got some guy that could understand them a little bit.  And all right, you're free to get on the fucking plane.  You think that would happen now?  How many of these pages did you read?  A couple of hundred.  Was it a page turner like the Warren report?  It really was a page turner.  It was very good.  And even the footnotes.  You know, some of the footnotes were very interesting little things.  And just information that you know it's a collection and it's not this partisan crap. 
[00:19:30]  It's a collection of all the evidence, the physical evidence, the hardware, the testimony from so many different people and agencies and everything that they pawed through.  And the thing is, it makes sense.  It makes perfect sense.  Not like this fucking guy with a plane that landed and then another plane, Flight 93 landed behind it. 
[00:20:00]  Oh God.  And 15 minutes later they all got out and went into a NASA building where 200 people, he don't know where they went but they're somewhere.  Get the fuck out of here.  See, this is what sucks about most conspiracy people is you have no ability to critique when you're wrong.  Like, one of the things that bothered me about the Pentagon hit was, or the Trade Center I understood, but the Pentagon, why is there, there really was hardly any plane.  It's like, how does a plane vaporize?  And he actually did something cool.  He showed a piece of a mountain, like a plane that hit a mountain doing 500 miles an hour. 
[00:20:30]  And he goes, this is what you'd probably find.  You'd find this and that.  Alright, where was that?  And then someone else sent me footage, one of the listeners again, always coming through, of fucking plane.  They did a test on nuclear reactors of this plane that flew.  Did you see that in the video?  Yeah.  Vaporized.  The plane vaporized when it hit the thing.  Dust.  So that explains to me, oh yeah, that can happen if it hits a concrete wall with no give.  You can vaporize a plane.  And here's some of the things that they left out that these conspiracy guys leave out at the Pentagon.  There were wing marks so low on the building, this guy, it was a one in a million shot that he flew this plane into the Pentagon. 
[00:21:00]  Barely nicked the ground right before he hit.  So the wing level was very low and you could see it.  You could see where the wings actually hit the Pentagon.  They take a picture where the firemen have sprayed foam because that whole line was on fire.  They spray foam so now you can't see where the wings hit.  And they say, where are the wing marks?  Well, they're under the fucking foam. 
[00:21:30]  They also show this fenced in area where there was a generator.  And you can see exactly where the engine knocked two of these poles down and ripped through the fence.  They have it like if you just go to a few sites, you can see the exact path that all these planes took.  But, you know, we're all it again.  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Matt, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good, Matt.  Hey, man.  I mean, I'm not with that kook from yesterday.  All right.  I know that two planes flew in.  We all saw it. 
[00:22:00]  I mean, the entire world saw it.  The thing is, though, he did mention a stupid website that actually, if you see it, it does kind of make sense even though it's been disproven by the government.  But the one thing that got me was Flight 93 going in Pennsylvania and the one that went into the Pentagon.  Yeah.  And the website that he did mention, it actually did go into detail.  Eatabullet.com, I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it does make kind of sense.  I mean, if you really look at it. 
[00:22:30]  What makes sense?  Well, I mean, with the way the plane flew in the Pentagon, it shows that the light posts, there's light posts that were around it.  And there was actual film from the Marriott building from across the street.  And there was like video from, I believe, a few gas stations.  The government, the FBI came in and took and seized the film.  Yeah, we know that.  And the light posts were sheared off when the plane hit it.  Yeah.  But it was pointing in a different direction as opposed to where the plane was going in. 
[00:23:00]  Well, dude, my question is this, and this is something, I don't like the fact that they confiscated that film.  I mean, I understand the security, the bottom, the security was breached.  And as American citizens, they should show it.  But you really think that if they were plotting it and making it up that they would shear them in the wrong way?  Like, if they could pull this off, they would shear them in the correct direction.  You know, when a plane hits a light pole, I don't know if you can calculate which way it's going to fucking land to tell you the truth.  Yeah, but I mean, it was all going in one direction.  I mean, because the jet blast would obviously bring it back a different direction. 
[00:23:30]  But it was in a total different direction.  You know, there's a very heavy generator that was pushed by one of the engines toward the building.  Like, there are so many things that refute a light post that spins around like a pixie stick on the ground when it's getting hit.  It doesn't, that's not evidence that tells me that a plane didn't hit the building.  Right.  Because a light post is facing a weird way or in a strange place.  But this website's not, this website's also saying that it wasn't a passenger plane, that it was one of those, like a cruise missile. 
[00:24:00]  No, it was a, then where did the 757 landing gear come from?  Where did the engine, that's another thing.  This turbo fan from the engine, titanium, it didn't, you know something?  It's a blatant lie.  They, I looked at a blueprint of a 757 engine.  Jesus.  And the thing is he actually had one at home.  He didn't have to go find it.  It matches, that piece from the turbine matches perfectly to a 757 engine. 
[00:24:30]  It's a blow.  Wow.  A fucking Rolls-Royce engine.  It's, it, it matches perfectly.  Also, the, uh, do you think that, did the honesty vaporize on the ground?  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  You know what?  Let me just look at Anthony and be nauseous.  Matt, sometimes you gotta really listen.  Do you understand what Anthony just did last night?  Look at that blueprint.  I, I, I looked at the insider.  Ah, the Katie Holmes countdown continues.  I, I, uh.  I was pissed off. 
[00:25:00]  I watched Kara from MySpace and almost got a tit shot when she was cleaning something  off the desk.  I love you punching out.  And Anthony is, uh, unrolling blueprints.  I had to compare.  That's great.  Reminds you of good old days, doesn't it, when the desert fox was looking for you.  Just unrolling them with all your generals.  Oh my God.  Look.  You are the only.  You are the only.  Someone has to do it.  You're literally one of the only people I know in this world that can make me feel really, 
[00:25:30]  really stupid.  I had to.  I was so angered.  You actually look at blueprints?  They're readily available.  They are readily available.  That's why I said, look, I don't want to go on a tear here for hours on end, but that's  what I said yesterday.  This was probably one point that I made.  I listened to the replay and was pissed off all over again.  I made a point to this guy.  And this is something I think a lot of people have to understand in order to think for yourself.  Both sides like to wrap things in packages they can shove down your throat. 
[00:26:00]  That's what this guy has.  He's got a collection.  He made his little flash movie.  It's great.  He used his new little programs to put all his little clips together with his horrid voice  over that he does on that.  You think you've seen enough?  Check it out.  Ugh.  Shut up if I may borrow from Jimmy.  Ugh.  That was a different guy I think he had.  The guy we were supposed to get was the narrator.  Yeah.  But then they brought in the big guns.  Yes. 
[00:26:30]  9-11 investigation.  Hold on.  Baba.  I bet you he actually has like a piano soundtrack following him whenever he walks in.  Baba.  Baba.  My God.  It's the kid with the guts.  Taking on the government.  My God, man.  Young go-getter.  There he is.  Don't tangle with Corey.  And they like to wrap things up and shove it down your throat because it's so easily  packaged that if you watch the whole thing and know nothing else about the situation,  you would sit there and go, wow. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, check that out.  Whoa, look.  The engine doesn't match.  Hey, look.  There was no evidence of a plane here.  Hey, there's flashes that look like multiple explosions bringing the building down.  But all right.  You don't have to go punching up blueprints to certain aircraft.  But there are other ways and means of informing yourself that refute these things.  And, you know, read the 9-11 Commission report, at least pieces of it.  Look online for other pictures from the Pentagon. 
[00:27:30]  Look at all the pictures that you can find of the Pentagon.  Can I get the cliff notes?  No, you kind of got to find it yourself.  Dwayne Reed, you want the cliff notes?  I want the cliff notes, please.  Or how about this?  Don't read any blueprints.  Just hang out with someone who would.  There you go.  There you go.  Just hang out with a smart friend.  You've got a smart friend.  What, um, what would Corey say when he walks into the room about something like that?  Um, the blueprints were manufactured by the government man. 
[00:28:00]  Hey, get me my shirt.  What does it say on it?  9-11 Investigation.  And he can't talk till the music stops, so he has to stare longer than it's comfortable.  All right, well. 
[00:28:30]  Stupid.  That cop yesterday was great.  No, it didn't, stupid.  No, it didn't.  I was there, stupid.  He asks him, too.  The cop was so, like, so pissed.  He just goes, oh, well, how did the building come down?  Well, it, no, it didn't, stupid.  Well, here's a guy that was there.  And the guy sounded to me legit like a, like, a legit retired detective.  Oh, yeah.  Just the way he was talking, you know, a retired cop.  The bottom of the building was, was, uh, was, was, was, was damaged.  Obviously, I'm falling, okay, and he saw it, and he's saying, I saw it, and, and this, 
[00:29:00]  this young dummy is going, no, that's not it, you're mistaken.  Yeah.  Because what?  You read it or you talked to it?  Shut up!  The guy wasn't there, and then you realize, this motherfucker was 18 when it happened?  Yeah, you little shit.  He probably got called out of school when it happened.  We saw it, buster.  Don't tell me with your shirt.  What does his shirt say? 
[00:29:30]  9-11 Investigation!  Let's go to Craig in Texas.  Hey, Craig.  Hey, fellas.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Uh, my father-in-law works at the Pentagon, has worked at the Pentagon about 12 years now.  And we had to sit down and talk about it.  I've been to the Pentagon.  I've seen the little memorial they have.  Hmm.  And he's not going to tell me a lie.  I mean, he, he, luckily he wasn't in his office. 
[00:30:00]  He was in the meeting.  If he was in his office, he would have been dead.  Yeah.  I can't say much about the World Trade Center, but I can talk about the Pentagon a little bit.  And it happened.  Right.  It just happened.  That's the way it happened.  And then he talks about, what did he say yesterday, that the G-forces of the plane,  he made it at 500 miles an hour.  He made it over 300 degree turn to turn into the Pentagon.  You read the report, idiot, from the FAA and from air traffic controllers. 
[00:30:30]  He made the turn and then goosed it and flew in straight at 500, uh, uh, over 500 miles an hour  from five miles away.  It was five miles away when he made that turn at a speed that could handle the turn.  And then he goosed it full speed over 500 miles an hour into the building, which would pulverize  the plane.  The guy didn't.  And they like to just, he cut, pulled out of his ass.  Oh, so at 500 miles an hour, you're going to make a 330 degree turn? 
[00:31:00]  No.  It's not how it happened.  He just mixes shit up, pulls it out of his asshole.  And a valid point is, look, there's voice recordings.  People, family recognize the voice recordings.  You ever hear the flight attendant voice?  Voice morphing.  Dude, voice morphing.  There's a program that you just need 10 minutes, maybe, of audio from anybody.  And you can type it in, and the guy's voice will come out and say anything.  Oh.  So that's what was happening.  These people's family weren't getting calls from loved ones.  They were getting voice morphed calls. 
[00:31:30]  Such outrageous X-Files shit.  And these people were giving the right answers.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  Yeah.  You would think something would be up like that.  The guy, I said, is it possible that it's just people that hate us and wanted to kill it?  And he goes, no, that is impossible.  Oh, that's impossible, but your fucking wacky contraption of a plan.  You know what else?  Of a plan.  You know what else was impossible?  Him to feel like he was going to amount to anything in the eyes of his parents. 
[00:32:00]  Exactly.  And now, all of a sudden, he's doing something, and they probably try to fake like they're  proud of him.  Like, no, no, you're still doing that.  That's good.  I think he comes over the house.  Yes.  And, like, it's always about this.  He argues with his dad all the time.  Yeah.  His father's just like, ugh, what are you?  It's such a douche.  How did I raise you?  He looks at dad.  His dad's probably a veteran and everything, and he's sitting in the chair, and I don't know,  what would he say to him?  Like, something stupid about the buildings.  You know, dad, it's people like you are narrow-minded. 
[00:32:30]  Stop staring creepily at his father.  Jesus, stop.  What up with the stare?  The way he stares, he has a hand on his hip, and he points with one finger.  Ass.  Mike in Jersey.  What's up, Mike?  That's it, youngster.  All right.  Let's go, Mike.  Hello?  Let's go.  What's up, man?  Hey. 
[00:33:00]  I just wanted to say, since I've been listening, I got my XM for Christmas.  Yeah.  Yesterday was two of the funniest segments I've heard.  Between Norton's call and Steve from Yellowstone, I was going to grab a salad for lunch, and I  ended up hearing Steve from Yellowstone, and I'm there with the headphones on, and I'm  starting to cringe.  And the minute I heard Ramon, I burst out into laughter, where tears are streaming down  my face.  Thank you.  Oh, the call.  I heard the replay.  Too goddamn funny.  Pound it.  The AIDS, my favorite.  I hope you get AIDS from your sippy cup. 
[00:33:30]  There's one point I had to make.  Did anybody ever go on these guys that the Pentagon is a fortress?  Yeah.  You know, the thing is, the plane flies into a 500 miles an hour.  The Pentagon is the symbol of our defense.  It's a fortress.  It's got miles and miles of stuff underneath it.  Anything that's going to crash into that or attack it, it's not going to fall down.  So for that little part to be destroyed and the plane be incinerated, it kind of makes 
[00:34:00]  sense.  And the beauty is, like, the one thing they said was Rumsfeld was safely on the other  side of the building in his office.  Like, that was the government was going to do this, and Rumsfeld was in on it, and Rumsfeld  said, alright, I'll be in the building, but just make sure I'm on the other side.  Yeah, right.  Just make sure I'm not on that side when you do it.  Yeah, I think they could come up with a better excuse.  Why you happy in China or something.  Exactly.  Couldn't Rumsfeld have been somewhere?  Right.  Perhaps in Nantucket shopping?  Yeah.  I was looking for Scrimshaw.  Didn't really sound like Rumsfeld, but you got the point.  Not really. 
[00:34:30]  I was doing impersonations.  I sounded more like Carson.  Did a good Carson yesterday.  Yeah, I certainly did.  When did the movie JFK come out?  I don't know, but don't ask for that high-pitched fucking trailing voice again.  Yeah.  When did the movie JFK come out?  Jimmy Acting.  Bye.  Bye, my dear.  Say, I'm Mr. X Bubba Truths on your side.  He was feeling really good and figured he'd have a conversation.  That's right.  Beat it, stupid.  You're not solving anything.  Scott in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  I wouldn't say I necessarily agree with that psycho pass from yesterday.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  But I have a question.  I went down there.  I worked down here, and I was down there on the pile of a volunteer firefighter.  But I have a question.  If, like, one World Trade came down, two World Trade, five and seven.  But, like, the Millennium Building was fine.  140 West Street was fine.  And, like, I'm not saying, I mean, I think that kid's a psychopath.  Yeah.  Dude, you know what it is?  A lot of people can't accept the fact that things are, like, random, you know? 
[00:35:30]  Chaos theory, things like that.  Why does a tornado, like, wipe out the house, one house, and then the house next door doesn't  even have a scratch on it?  Yeah.  Things like that.  There's no test that was ever run on slamming two planes into two giant buildings.  So, one building falls, the other one doesn't, you know?  Yeah.  It just, it happened that way.  But it's just World Trade Center building falling.  And, dude, let me tell you something.  If the government was really doing it, that should be an indicator to you that it was not, 
[00:36:00]  they're not, if they're smart enough to pull that off, do you really think they'd blow everything  around it up and then not the Millennium Building?  No, that's what I'm saying.  It doesn't make any sense at all.  I mean, it was pretty crazy being down there, but it's just...  By it not making sense, sir, that is what makes perfect sense.  Do you understand that part of, like, that's what the conspiracy guy doesn't understand.  Well, there's this little thing, and that's how things happen in life.  It's very random.  Yeah, I know.  It happens like that.  Two planes hit two buildings, they fall down, they're going to smash one, 
[00:36:30]  the other one's not going to be touched, things happen.  And what's his name?  That pedestrian bridge didn't go down.  Holy shit.  What a surprise that was.  Is that still up?  Yeah.  They didn't replace that, did they?  No.  It's still the original.  I was surprised as hell to see that thing was still standing after the whole thing.  What are you talking about, that glass atrium?  Yeah, it's like the sheet metal and windows.  Across the west side highway.  Across the west side highway.  I know what you're talking about.  It's dented, it's got some holes in it, but it's still there. 
[00:37:00]  The buildings were connected to the fucking building.  Did they knock down that other building yet, that's just been sitting there,  that basically a huge piece of it has been carved out?  They're working on it.  They actually found some more remains on the roof the other day.  The other day?  The other day?  Yeah, just the other day.  They found some bones on the roof.  Oh yeah, that was a new day, I saw that.  That they're, you know, they send off to identify.  They'll be finding shit for poof, for years.  Wow.  Every time they move some piece of a building, there's remains. 
[00:37:30]  All right, Scott.  All right, guys, you guys suck.  Love you, bye-bye.  Those must have been the people, you know, that got off the plane.  I was down there within the first week or two, and that one building,  to see the whole front of it just gone.  It looked like Godzilla took his claw and went and just scratched it and left,  because you saw the floors in there and everything.  And it was like 30, 40 stories up, and there was, you know,  the fire department and the NYPD just with huge brooms just sweeping entire offices out.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Because the wall was gone, and you just see desks and computer equipment  and chairs just falling and falling into a, you know, a huge pile,  because they were just, you know, cleaning it up or whatever.  Wasn't there a giant piece of, because, you know, the towers have this great,  very distinctive, like, you'll be able to phrase it better than that.  Remember, like, you see the picture after it fell?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, the metal facade.  Facade, right.  Yeah, facade, thank you.  Yeah.  A piece of that fell into the building, like a tomahawk almost.  Yeah, yeah, and it was, it left a big crease and was stuck right in the side of it. 
[00:38:30]  It was like a piece of snow with like a, I don't give a very good example.  It was like a piece of snow with an icicle sticking.  Yeah.  I didn't give the worst examples.  No, it wasn't.  It was like fluffing on her, but yet in a different state.  What an ass I am.  Can I fucking enunciate or paint a picture?  Ant, you paint these amazing pictures.  You really are fucking.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Fucking Davey description.  And I have no ability.  And we hate you for it.  Oh, we believe me.  And that tight sweater is making me sick to my stomach.  Yeah, I knew it would. 
[00:39:00]  The second I put this on this morning, I go, this is trouble.  It's like a child's medium.  This is awful.  I knew this was going to be trouble right when I put it on.  I opened my closet door and went, oh boy, this is going to be trouble.  And that takes some of the attention away from me because I wasn't able to shower today.  Yeah, but no one would know that.  You don't smell.  I mean, no one would know that till you hear.  Oh, the hair doesn't look too greasy or anything?  It's got a pattern of an apple pie on it, too.  Oh, I kind of like that.  That nice little criss-cross look.  It's adorable.  Isn't it beautiful?  All right, listen, why don't we take a break?  All righty. 
[00:39:30]  We're done with the 9-11 stuff for now.  Yeah.  That was a lot of fun yesterday on so many levels.  We've got Drew Boogie in studio.  He's mixing live for us.  So we'll let him do that, and then we'll come back.  We'll talk about Tyra Banks and what she did on her stupid America's Next Top Model show.  Psychopath, she is.  Psychopath, she is.  It is hilarious.  And then we've got to talk about Tyra Banks.  Tyra Banks!  She did another phobia show.  This is her thing that she does.  That's her thing?  It's her thing.  You've got to give her credit.  Did anyone else do this before?  Like, everyone does the paternity shows. 
[00:40:00]  A lot of people do the cheating show, Springer, things like that.  The freak show.  Has she kind of...  Does she own this?  She...  Does she make up the phobia and then people facing it?  Yeah.  Wow, alright.  She's...  Give her some credit.  She's ridiculous.  She's a genius and a psychopath.  Wait to hear about the lady that is scared of ovens and what Tyra made her do.  Oh, no.  For some kind of cute little prize.  What happened?  Why was Mrs. Siegel so nervous? 
[00:40:30]  But first, it's Drew Boogie, everyone.  Huh, huh?  Mhm.  Ha!  Heh heh heh heh heh...  They were like...  Ha!  Yeah!  Justll take!  Juk!  Just...  Just...  Just...  Just...  Just...  Just...  Just...  Just...  We'll be right back. 
[00:41:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:41:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:42:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:42:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:43:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:43:30]  And Michael Imperioli, but De Niro and Frank Vincent.  Frank Vincent was in a very hectic situation, but it was very funny. 
[00:44:00]  He just kind of snapped at me.  Did he?  Yeah, but I got kissed later, so I didn't really count it.  I'll tell the story when he calls in.  Oh, guys, just sit down for it.  He kissed you?  No, no, no.  I got kissed later.  Jesus, Ope.  That would have been a nice way to surprise you.  Oh, you said I got kissed later.  I kissed.  You were looking in the mirror, and you want to buy some pot?  All right.  Jim Norton, by the way, the article, another fine article on Jim Norton came out today.  Of course.  Google Opie and Anthony and hit news, and you'll see an article called Jim Norton of Opie and Anthony is the headline. 
[00:44:30]  And it's a fine article, Jimmy.  Jimmy's playing Bananas and Poughkeepsie all weekend long.  He's leaving right after the show today.  And this is by this guy.  What's his name?  Jermaine Lussier, which is probably the worst name for a reporter ever.  But he's a fan of the show, and he does accurate jobs with articles, man.  He doesn't fucking misquote you in editables.  No.  I love that he left this in.  He has a question.  If you had to sell yourself to an audience of people who know nothing about you, what would you say, I asked Norton in a phone interview. 
[00:45:00]  Norton's response is, hold on, sweetie.  Let me pay for my lunch and think about that.  Hold on, sweetie.  Norton says in an understated calm voice.  He calls the delivery man, mister, gives him a $4 tip, and answers the question.  Thanks, mister.  That's exactly what happened.  Of course.  Thank you, mister.  And then proceeds to say, kind of Disney-ish, but I think AIDS is funny.  That's the answer. 
[00:45:30]  I summed them up.  I know.  I wish.  Yeah, it's a rough one.  I think AIDS is funny because now I feel like, well, I don't really mean AIDS itself.  Right.  It's more of the tears that it causes.  And then he teases the whole Monster Rain story at the beginning of the article.  And then at the end of the article says he can't really tell you what Monster Rain is all about.  You'll have to go to the show to find out for yourself.  And you won't from Jimmy, but, you know, you could ask around.  It's a very good article.  We'll link it on opianthony.com so you can read the whole thing yourself.  He did a very nice job.  Or just Google Opie and Anthony and you'll find the, it'll be the latest article that's up. 
[00:46:00]  There you go.  Do we have the article that that woman did for Time Out Magazine, which really has been bugging me for a week and a half now.  So I read it on a break.  Drew, can you hand me that?  It's right there, sweetie.  It's a Time Out.  Here, here.  Here's mine.  Oh, I don't want to take your copy open while you'll read.  I get to just sit back and watch.  I haven't read this.  Well, it's an article about the Aspen Festival, the comedy festival that I went to.  And this woman, her name is Jane Borden, right?  And she's from Time Out Magazine.  I wish I had the magazine in front of me because her email address is in it. 
[00:46:30]  And I will give it out because it's in a magazine for publication.  Yeah, her first name is definitely Jane because I got a correspondence.  Jane Borden.  We've been trying to get her on the show.  Whenever there's an uncomfortable thing like this or something I don't like, you want to address it with the person on the air and give them a chance.  To respond.  What happened was she reviewed the Aspen Festival.  And, you know, Chappelle was there.  And she's quoting some of the festival.  And here's one of Dave's lines that she quotes.  Dave Chappelle on last year's flight to Africa. 
[00:47:00]  I'm the first missing nigger that ever made the paper.  And it's true.  I felt very at home in Africa and blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then she goes on.  She's giving, like, best Aspen is homogenous joke.  Best trend eight.  Or best of this, best of that.  Here's the best change of tune.  After watching a clip of his 18-year-old self on an early episode of Def Jam during the Freedom Speech Award panel honoring Russell Simmons,  Dave Chappelle said that was the tail end of gay jokes being acceptable.  I guess he did a bad gay joke.  And those days are over.  And here she says, while sensitivity is always applauded, one can't help but wonder when gay jokes were acceptable. 
[00:47:30]  Can one not help but wonder, Jane?  How about 1953?  That's right.  Good year for them.  And also, when is sensitivity ever applauded in humor?  Never.  Never.  It's never, ever in real life?  Terrific.  When you see a comedian and they're being sensitive, you're in the audience going,  Make me laugh, asshole.  I come here for this shit.  Point out some reality. 
[00:48:00]  Don't hide behind that.  Give me some black humor.  And real chicken wings.  I'm hungry.  And where's the rest of the article?  Oh, well, uh...  Oh, no.  I have...  Oh, no.  Well, uh...  Oh, here it is.  Okay, they didn't highlight the bottom part.  He's thinking the same thing I am.  We're all in a good mood lately.  Let's just keep it this way.  And cover.  Duck.  And here's one of her favorite, uh...  Where's one of her favorite lines?  Boy, they didn't highlight a lot of things. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, the, uh...  Best one-liners?  Which was...  Oh, yeah.  Which is a good one.  By a Canadian comic, Stuart Francis.  My dad collects empty bottles, which sounds much better than alcoholic.  Which is not a bad line.  Yeah.  Uh...  And here's at the end.  Most disturbing theme.  Out of the 15 live events we caught over four nights, 10 contained at least one rape joke.  And even more were aggressively misogynistic in time.  Uh...  This is the festival of violence against women, an anonymous insider scout noted with derision, 
[00:49:00]  or derision, however you say it, uh...  At a late-night party.  Some anonymous...  Fucking reporters can say whatever they want, as long as they say it's from an anonymous source.  Anonymous industry.  A very scout.  A scout.  All of media does that.  We talk about how the media will go, uh, people are saying...  Well, who are the people?  Who are they?  Who are they?  Who are they?  You sure they're not you?  Only...  And then she says, one can only assume that 14 years from now, Jim Norton et al. 
[00:49:30]  will look back on their performances and say that 2006 was the tail end of when rape jokes were acceptable.  But it's more likely they'll find Amelia Earhart first.  This just in.  Amelia Earhart found.  Absolutely.  And rape jokes?  Rib ticklers.  And so she didn't crucify me, but I know what she's doing.  And there's nothing that makes me want to throw up more than someone who imposes their ideology as far as what is acceptable and what's not. 
[00:50:00]  She wants a good old-fashioned redneck joke.  This is what Bobby...  That's what she wants.  Of course.  Like all these fucking phonies calling out Larry the cable guy.  I know you're a redneck.  I know you're a redneck.  If you got two cars in your yard up on cinder...  That's the type of humor she finds funny.  She has no business writing about comedy.  Of course she doesn't.  She likes sensitivity.  And by the way...  As a writer, write about something else.  How about this?  Leave the comedy to somebody else.  To men.  How about this?  Why is that unacceptable? 
[00:50:30]  Why is that all of a sudden hit your little ideological inappropriate button?  And yet the lying quote from Chappelle...  Dave Chappelle on last year's flight to Africa.  I'm the first missing nigger that ever made the paper.  Or why is that acceptable?  You know...  Why isn't this the last year that saying the word nigger is acceptable in comedy?  You understand?  It is, Jimmy.  Didn't you check?  Well...  You didn't get the memo.  We have a few short months left.  Ooh.  Better use it up.  But do you understand what I'm saying?  It's like why...  If you want to talk about invoking images of barbarism... 
[00:51:00]  I would say that those two words, nigger and rape...  Are fairly hand-in-hand as far as how awful...  So she would never critique a black performer.  Well, what sucks about this conversation is that...  We wanted, or Jimmy wanted, especially, to do it to her.  Have her call the show.  And Ben's been going back and forth with her all week long.  Or even longer, actually.  And finally, we got the last communique in, I guess, yesterday.  And it simply says,  Unfortunately, I don't think we'll ever find a convenient time.  Ever.  Ever.  But thanks for asking. 
[00:51:30]  So busy.  Good luck with the show, Jane.  Okay.  Jane.  Comedy at TimeOutNewYork.com  That's comedy at TimeOutNewYork.com  TimeOutNewYork, but New York is abbreviated.  And it's in the magazine, so I'm not giving out anything personal.  Her name is Jane Borden.  If any of you guys know her,  maybe some of you guys have read other opinions on comedy she's had.  But to me, there's nothing more revolting.  Seven dirty words are fair.  They're universal.  You can't say no matter who you are and under what circumstances. 
[00:52:00]  But when ideology gets opposed like that,  that is the problem right there.  The same way the religious nuts do it,  with, ah, you'll make fun of the church and God,  the fucking women like this do it,  with rape jokes or any type of anti-woman joke.  Let's go to Mike in Boston.  Mike, you're on.  Yo, Jimmy, I think you're really funny, number one.  No doubt.  But I gotta say, like,  when I hear, like, the child molesting shit and, like, rape jokes,  it's not about, like, you're crossing a line or some shit like that.  I just think it's, I think it's uncalled for. 
[00:52:30]  And it's just like, I don't think anyone's,  I think you could be a lot bigger if you just cut that shit out.  But how about, dude, here's my question for you.  This is my thing.  Like, when you look at the line, the line she likes very much.  My dad collects empty bottles, which sounds much better than alcoholic.  Any subject you take and you break down  can be horrible to a group of people.  Obviously, rape, child molesting, terrible things.  But you know what?  If truth be told, I'm an alcoholic.  There's a lot of alcoholics in my family. 
[00:53:00]  You know, the members of my family have either done horrible things to themselves  because of alcoholism.  Do you want to go over the drunk driving guests  and the abused children, the abused women due to alcoholism?  So why is that an acceptable?  Do you understand?  Like, as somebody who is,  someone was probably offended by that joke.  Or, but I mean, if you're going to be literal about humor,  if you're going to start picking apart what is quote-unquote acceptable,  what subjects are left with very few exceptions?  Yeah, that's the point Jimmy's trying to make there, Mike.  It's okay.  Hold on.  It's okay if you personally don't like that type of humor. 
[00:53:30]  That's not what we're saying.  But she's trying to decide for everybody else out there what's acceptable or not.  Acceptable.  And we can't live like that.  You don't dig child molesting jokes?  Okay.  I mean, that's not your thing.  All right.  No big deal.  I'll be the first person to say that's absolutely fine.  As long as you're not going over saying,  hey, Jim, I don't think that's acceptable content to talk about.  I don't agree with her on that.  I mean, she definitely shouldn't.  Nobody should be drawing the line for it.  No.  I'm so doubtful about that.  But I don't know why we need to go to that area. 
[00:54:00]  It's like, I don't know.  Dude, to me, the darker,  the only time I don't think something's funny,  or the only line I draw, or the main line,  is something that's done to be deliberately cruel.  Like, if you say, there's a guy in a wheelchair in the audience,  and you're, like, doing vicious wheelchair jokes,  and it's obvious that you're doing them because he's there,  then your intentions are to be cruel,  and everybody knows what your intentions are,  and that's a decision each individual performer has to make.  Hey, man, that's all I got. 
[00:54:30]  I mean, that's really all I got, Jimmy.  No, it's not.  You have a lot more than that young fella.  But do you understand what I mean, dude?  If you don't like child molesting jokes, that's what I'm saying.  That's cool.  I'm not saying you have to like that type of humor.  But, you know, cops have gallows humor,  and I'm not saying I live through what cops do,  but my humor comes from a lot of awful self-hatred and awful places,  so it comes into a, you know.  Now, Jimmy, there's a guy from Texas online,  and he says, it's comedy, everything goes.  Do you agree with that?  Again, up to the line of what is deliberately cruel, 
[00:55:00]  because you're trying to hurt somebody, yeah.  But then at that point, you're not really going for the laugh.  Absolutely.  That's what I mean.  So in comedy, does everything goes?  Yeah.  This is like a Sex and the City moment.  Ooh.  Now we have to figure out the answer to the question.  Do you actually know how that show's formula works?  Of course.  Oh, don't give me the of course like every guy.  I'm the only one that had a sex or sex in the city.  Never, never, ever sat through one fucking episode.  Because you're too busy looking at fucking blueprints of 757s. 
[00:55:30]  Which I'd rather do.  More attractive than any woman on that fucking show.  Yeah, that's crazy.  But I'm the only guy out there that has sat through a Sex and the City.  All right.  Yeah.  I have to hold.  Give me.  I have to hold my Samantha impression.  Did you sit through an episode of Sex and the City?  No.  You sit through an episode?  Thank you.  Moulin Rouge also.  He pushed that one.  Ew.  Sex and the City.  Sex and the City.  No.  Sex and the City.  No.  They're not being honest.  Honestly, I would ask Steve C, but yeah, please, Jesus. 
[00:56:00]  He's got the box hat.  He knows he's a kid.  I never liked the lighting on that show.  Fucking Steve.  Jesus.  Waiting for my Amazon box.  I mean, I got the director's cut.  Yeah, do you?  Season five tomorrow.  It's a Sex and the City marathon this weekend.  Great.  I even watch it on TV.  Not as stupid Sarah Jessica Parker, whatever her character is.  Yeah, whatever. 
[00:56:30]  No, I'll be honest.  I forgot the name of her character.  Horse Face.  No?  I don't remember.  Well, I know Samantha's the Whore.  Right.  Okay.  That I know.  Holy crap.  I don't remember her name in the show.  Barbara.  That's a long time.  Yeah.  Barbara.  But then she presents a little question.  Carrie.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Ah.  And for her column, she writes a little question.  And then she answers the question.  Thank you, Quaggett.  So she presents a question.  What?  At the table where the whore is saying who she fucked last night? 
[00:57:00]  No, usually on her laptop on top of her comfy bed.  What do you got?  No?  Angry typing cunt?  No.  She's just on her comfy bed with a little cup of tea.  Aw.  You know, a little top.  She's sitting Indian style, all comfy.  There's a little...  In the gutter with a bottle of booze.  Some kind of Afghan.  One of my favorite boss jokes.  Some kind of Afghan nearby in case she gets a little cold.  Aw.  Ugh.  Exactly.  A little candle burning.  Stop. 
[00:57:30]  Ugh.  A little scented candle.  Mmm.  Scented candle.  Some potpourri.  Right.  Just...  God, any self-respecting guy watching that show.  Ladies, the reality is we don't get your shit, man.  It's just...  I don't get it.  Tea stinks.  Speaking of tea, I got teabag last night by some construction worker that was doing work  in my building.  Let's get a bill in Jersey. 
[00:58:00]  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Ladies and gentlemen, I was dropping some of Norton's lines recently at Pace University.  And these conservative fucks, they just have no sense of humor whatsoever.  Conservatives in a college?  Which...  In a college?  Yeah, in college.  The specific line that I dropped was, get a coat hanger and fix the first mistake. 
[00:58:30]  And I got fucking chewed apart for it.  I don't understand.  You know, I laughed at that line.  Well, maybe your timing was off.  That's right.  You didn't have good timing.  My timing was fucking perfect.  Hanging out with a bunch of sorority girls, fucking hammered.  Well, that's a rough one.  I thought it was perfect.  I mean, look, as much as most colleges, you know, kind of make me...  I mean, we all watched, you know, the Kent State footage and we'd laugh good naturedly.  But I mean, most colleges really do make me sick.  But I mean, when you're doing an abortion joke to a bunch of sorority girls... 
[00:59:00]  Ow.  ...it's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  Sometimes you do have to...  I mean, there are lines you draw, common sense lines.  Yeah.  Like, you know, you don't do that until after you're, you know, committing a murder like Bundy.  All right.  All right, guys.  That's all right.  Bye, you little doll.  No more violence against women.  Let's go to Fernando in New York.  Why...  By the way, why is it bad, by the way, to address it in humor?  Why can't I address violence against women in humor?  Why is that unacceptable?  And yet not one of these convention bitches ever complains about Lifetime.  Why should those artists in that station address all this violence against women?  Because ideologically, you know where they go with it? 
[00:59:30]  You like where they go with it?  See, in there, the victim is what it is.  They're the...  Oh, such a fine line between genius and stupid.  Hey, Fernando, real fast, because we've got a big star on hold here.  All right, no problem, guys.  Two really quick things.  One thing.  That lady, Jane, she sits there and laughs at blonde jokes, at Polish jokes, at redneck jokes.  Isn't she being sensitive to them about them being stupid all the time?  Okay, good point.  And two, can you guys later on maybe touch on if you guys saw the South Park episode last night? 
[01:00:00]  Which one?  It was actually about Muslims and Mohammed being on the family guy.  Oh, yeah, it's a two-parter.  Got to wait for the second part.  Yeah, we got some clips of that we could go over a little bit today.  Ah, cool, guys, thanks.  All right, we got one of my favorite people on the phone.  Yeah, he writes, it's funny until it's personal, which is...  Absolutely.  ...is very, very true.  ...poses on their ideology.  All right, let's...  We'll get back to that in a second, and you'll comment about Jane a little more?  Yeah, sure.  All right, but first, it's Frank Vincent, everyone. 
[01:00:30]  Frank!  Hey!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hey, there he is.  Opie and Anthony, what are you doing?  There he is.  Paisan.  How are you, Paisano?  Very good, very good.  Who am I talking to?  Well, Opie...  It's Opie over there, and I'm Anthony.  We have a little Jimmy Norton over here.  How'd you get an Irish guy in there?  Ah.  I always come in.  I just kind of come in until they finally just started to pay me.  You know how...  The Italians and Irish have always worked pretty well together.  I know.  I married one.  You did?  Yeah, a long time ago.  How'd that work out for you? 
[01:01:00]  I have beautiful kids, Italian-Irish kids.  Yeah, they usually come out pretty good.  Yep.  Like, they got that good Irish look, but then a little bit of a tan, which is nice.  A lot of loyalty.  Frank, I'm such a big Frank Vincent fan.  I love the fact, first of all, I love the fact that you finally got to smash Pesci after  what he did to you in Raging Bull and Goodfellas.  You finally got him back in Casino.  That must have been kind of satisfying.  It was fun.  Did you like it?  I loved it.  It was just a good batting.  Yeah.  It was a good batting in the cornfield in Vegas. 
[01:01:30]  It really was some retribution there, because you really got it bad in Goodfellas.  Yeah, he gave it to me.  But, you know, most of that was a stuntman, so it didn't hurt.  Oh, really?  I know.  We would hope so.  Sorry there.  I annoyed you one time.  I've only met you one time.  Okay.  And it was at the Kiss Aerosmith concert.  Okay.  And you were running backstage.  You were very busy.  And I'm like, I have my camera, and I'm like, my God, it's Frank Vincent.  I'm like, hey, Frank, can I get a picture?  And you're like, not now. 
[01:02:00]  And I'm like, but I got my camera out, and he said, I said, not now.  And I'm like, God damn it, he did say that.  You know, I was going into the dressing room because I had introduced him on the stage.  No, no, I know, because the security guard wouldn't let you back.  And you're like, I got to get on the stage.  And I said to the security guard, and I know he doesn't remember me, but I said to the security guard, dude, you know who that is?  That's Frank Vincent.  He was in Goodfellas and Raging Bull, and he let him back.  And then the six-foot-eight security guard.  Are you trying to take credit for getting Frank Vincent backstage?  Yes, as well as recommending him for those films. 
[01:02:30]  You are an ass.  You know, when you bring up Goodfellas, everybody, wherever I go, whoever I talk to in the street, in the restaurant, whatever, they all give me the famous line.  You know the famous line?  Get your shine box.  Go home and get your shine box.  Yeah.  My favorite line from that scene, though, is when you said, you're getting fucking fresh.  Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.  It's like...  I've been away a few years, and right away you're over here getting fucking fresh.  Dude, it's like you're in jail probably for murder. 
[01:03:00]  He's a murderer, but he's getting fresh.  Getting fresh, right, at the bar.  That, to me, is the best line ever done in a movie by anybody.  But to do the right...  But to go home and get your shine box, what I did with that, I have...  The character's Billy Bats, so I put him on a T-shirt, and I have go home and get your shine box, and I have Billy Bats T-shirts for sale on my website.  Do you really?  I can't believe it.  People buy it.  They buy 200 a day.  It's amazing.  How do you not love...  What's the website?  Please, let's plug that.  FrankVincent.com. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, you got the FrankVincent.com, nice.  Nice.  I love seeing your role being expanded on Sopranos.  Yep.  That's very nice.  And it's going to get bigger.  Yeah, you guys, with all your secrets, I love talking to you, but I hate talking to you guys because there's no answers.  You get no...  They, like...  There is some kind of a Cosa Nostra code that goes on with the writers and the cast of the Sopranos.  You guys don't rat.  Oh, Murta.  You know, I'm Murta.  I'm Murta. 
[01:04:00]  You guys don't rat.  It's easy.  It's easy not to rat.  You know why?  Because if you're a rat, David writes you off the show.  Oh, is that what...  So you actually virtually get whacked if you're a rat.  You actually virtually sign a confidentiality thing, and your scripts are all numbered with your name on it, and you go to the read-through.  Every episode, we have a read-through with all the characters, and we read through the script, and you have to give the script back to production, and you keep your pages.  Wow.  And that's the way it works.  And that way they can keep everything secret. 
[01:04:30]  Well, you know what?  If people start talking about what's going to happen, nobody wants to watch it anymore.  It just takes away all the fun.  Yeah, it takes away the surprises.  I love when you're watching the show, and all of a sudden something happens, and you didn't expect...  I mean, Uncle Junior shooting Tony was one of those things where, as I'm watching it, I said, holy shit, what just happened?  You know, and yeah, you're right.  If you would have known about that in advance, it wouldn't have been as thrilling.  Sometimes you don't even put it in a script when we're doing a read-through, because you have new talent that's coming in just for this show. 
[01:05:00]  You have people coming in, like, just going to play one or two lines or three lines.  Yeah.  Is it true you've had extras killed so they don't talk about the show?  I've heard about that.  Blinded, and their tongue's taken off.  Their tongue's ripped out of their hands.  Also, they'll hide certain things on the read-throughs.  That's pretty interesting.  Yeah, like, you know, when she was going to get killed, Michael's...  Adriana, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Adriana, when she was going to get killed in the script that we had at the read-throughs, that she just drove away to Atlantic City. 
[01:05:30]  Huh.  Yeah, she certainly did.  They didn't reveal that she was shot.  It's kind of like M.A.S.H. when McLean Stevenson wanted to leave and they wanted to kill off Henry Blake.  They didn't tell anybody they were going to kill him off until Gary Berghoff just came in and read that his plane spun out.  They got an honest reaction out of the cast, yeah.  Then they realized, well, he's never coming back to the show.  That's why they were all like, fuck.  Wow.  Why are you going to do that stuff?  Yeah, it was very poignant of me to raise a 1974 example. 
[01:06:00]  Right on the money, kid.  Right on the money, kid.  I love it.  I always find it odd when you hear a story like that where a director went to get a true reaction and it didn't just end up with someone looking at the camera and going,  are you fucking shitting me?  Yeah.  Or something just ruining the entire shot.  There's two real reactions in Raging Bull.  One is when I go to the table, coming in the copa, and I see Jake and Joseph at the table, and I say to Jake, you're not drinking, are you? 
[01:06:30]  And he just looks at me.  Now, what happened was when they did my close-up, I said to Jake, you're not drinking, are you?  He said, why don't you go fuck your mother?  And I looked at him, and that's the look they took.  That's great.  Oh, that's great.  What's the other one?  That shit, yeah.  Yeah, what's the other one?  Because we all love Raging Bull.  The other one is in the gym.  And when I'm saying, you know, don't hurt yourself, Jake, when I was boxing in the gym, and he says, go fuck yourself. 
[01:07:00]  Same thing.  Same thing.  I heard he also, Pesci said that De Niro actually hurt him in that scene.  He was really pounding the shit out of him, and he said he really-  Oh, he cracked a rib, yeah.  Yeah, he really got a nice little savage.  That's just the greatest, though.  Yeah, don't hurt yourself.  What a great film that is.  Is that your favorite one that you've done, Raging Bull?  Yeah, well, Goodfellas in that one.  You know, I mean, they're all great.  I mean, how do you decide which one's better, you know?  How much do you want to throw up when you think of Scorsese not winning the Oscar for Best Director for that moment? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my God, come on.  That's stupid.  Stupid, stupid.  Ordinary people.  Best Picture, Best Director.  The fucking Academy should be firebombed.  Yeah.  What did the guys say this year on Academy Awards when the black group won an Oscar?  Yeah, it said Martin Scorsese doesn't have an Oscar.  Well, he said the group's name was, like, Tennis, what is it, Drew?  Memphis Mafia?  That's the black guy.  Memphis Mafia won Scorsese nothing.  Yeah.  John Stewart.  You know, yes, Scorsese's long overdue, man.  Yeah, it's almost like the running joke that he hasn't gotten an Oscar. 
[01:08:00]  He's one of the greatest directors in history.  Unbelievable.  Brilliant.  Hey, Frank, you got a book out.  A guide to being a man's man.  You got it there, brother?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we weren't able to look through it yet.  We just got him.  How's this going to help us out?  Well, listen, we got, in part one, we got dating like a man's man.  Getting the digits means getting the number from the girl.  The first date, tell the ex to go home and get a shine box.  Going steady.  Part two, watching movies like a man's man. 
[01:08:30]  We have our gangster flicks, western flicks, sports flicks, war flicks, chick flicks.  I don't think so.  You haven't been dragged to a chick flick?  Oh, yeah.  What are you going to do?  You watch Sex and the City?  You hope they get undressed once in a while.  You hope they get undressed once in a while.  What was the last chick flick you went to?  Gee, I don't know.  Something with Oprah in it, I guess.  Let's call it Darbel.  Kong? 
[01:09:00]  Oh, shit.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  Smoking cigars like a man's man, all right, with an interview by Big Pussy Pastor.  Sure, sure.  Sure, sure.  Mons, you're like a man's man.  It's our favorite restaurant.  Your mother's always the best cook.  That's entertaining.  And Salud, we teach you about wine and stuff.  It's all done with a very, very tongue-in-cheek.  Listening to music like a man's man, our top music legends.  Music picks.  An interview with our man's man, Stevie Van Zandt. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  Music to make love by.  What music to play when you're making love?  Gotta be Sinatra, right?  Yeah.  Fly Me to the Moon.  Of course.  Music to play.  Not to play when you're making love.  Celebration.  Right.  Taps, another bad one.  Visiting Vegas like a man's man.  We have a Vegas history, top ten man's man's hotels, and an interview with James Conn.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  And looking like a man's man.  The Looks, Getting Past the Doorman, Grooming, Accessories. 
[01:10:00]  We have a forward by James Gandolfini.  It's a hot book, man.  It's doing really good, and we're having a lot of fun with it.  Are you doing any signings in New York?  I know you did one in Jersey that I wanted to go to.  We did Huntington, Long Island.  Oh, okay.  Oh, he's right by where Hopi used to live there.  Yeah, yeah.  Damn it.  They get all the big stars in that bookstore.  We're going to Staten Island on May 2nd.  Okay.  Do you know the name of the bookstore?  Uh, it's, uh, Barnes & Noble, one of the Barnes & Nobles.  Okay, in Staten Island. 
[01:10:30]  Staten Island.  You got to come in and see us, man.  I would really love to, uh...  Get a picture with him.  Yep.  Yes, I would love...  That's what it's all about with Jimmy, is get just the picture.  Frank Vincent fan.  Who isn't?  I'll tell you what we'll do.  After the episode, like, after, like, a few more episodes, we'll come in and we'll do it.  Oh, oh, is that a hint?  All right, wait a minute.  No, no, that's as much of a hint as you're going to get.  Looks like it's going to get a lot more heat.  Well, maybe it'll be happening.  Maybe you'll want...  You'll say, please get Vincent back.  Get him back.  Get him back.  Yeah, you got an open invite, my friend.  Anytime you want to come in.  Okay, guys.  It's good to know. 
[01:11:00]  Frank, thanks so much for calling in.  Yeah, the book, once again, A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man, Frank Vincent.  Now, bookstores now, Barnes & Noble, you can get it on Amazon.  How about frankvincent.com?  You can get the Billy Batch shirts.  That's it.  All right, buddy.  That's Sada Marenga.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Frank.  Thank you, Frank.  Frank Vincent, everyone.  All right.  Legend.  I love him, man.  Guy's a legend.  But again, he's one of those guys that, like, I'm so glad everybody knows who he is now,  because for years, you would see him and go, that's the guy. 
[01:11:30]  That guy.  That guy.  That's the guy.  And then it's like now people are finally like, you know, that's his name.  He's kind of stepped out of the that guy, because I have a lot of that where you go,  oh, hey, look, it's that guy.  Yeah.  And he was that guy.  And I said this on break, and I'll bore the audience with it as I bored you with it.  John Cazale, I think for a long time, Fredo, was like, you go, that's Fredo.  You knew who he was.  Yeah.  But because he was always with De Niro or somebody of that, you know, star magnitude.  And then he got known as the old puddin' head.  Wow. 
[01:12:00]  Okay, I'm sorry.  That's a way to make it hurt, Andy.  We do.  We like him very much.  The old empty spot in Meryl's bed.  I mean, if you want to be hurtful completely.  He was getting brain tumors two at a time.  Right.  Jesus.  Players couldn't get a wig at the table.  Wow.  You're doing brain surgery on my brother?  All right. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  You don't smoke.  Your body is the temple of the Lord, but she'll rob a bank.  Give me the cigarette.  Okay.  Draw chemo for everybody at the table.  Fredo, your head is full of Jell-O, and I love you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  We like the guy.  I love the guy.  I loved his work and everything. 
[01:13:00]  It's fucking amazing.  It's tragic that he died so young.  Some type of brain cancer is horrible.  Let's say hi to Lori the trucker.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Howdy.  Hey, I hate to go back after such a great interview, and at the risk of an uncomfortable moment or a laughter break,  I, myself, have been a rape victim, and Anthony.  Oh, no.  All right.  Oh, no.  All right.  Tapping out.  Anthony hit on it. 
[01:13:30]  I hit on it?  Sorry about that.  I was drunk.  It was a pinball machine.  Hit him some friends.  It was good, though, baby.  No, actually, it has to do with victimization, and also another thing that you talk about,  the self-loathing in our country, because I'm not going to live my life being the victim  of something that really had absolutely nothing to do with me.  Right.  Yeah.  But these women can't get over that.  Well, I mean, look.  And I have to tell you that it actually, for me to be able to hear a joke about it, 
[01:14:00]  it is such a surreal, ridiculous thing to have happen.  Lori, are you comfortable at all with, without graphic detail, unless, you know, you want,  is there any way you can tell us briefly what happened to you and how it happened?  If you want to hear a good rape story, mine's great.  How did it happen?  Okay.  I had taken a break from college.  I was a nanny in Westchester County.  How old were you?  I was 19.  And this was what year? 
[01:14:30]  This was in the early 90s.  Early 90s.  You're 19.  Okay.  And you're a college girl.  Yes.  Okay.  Well, I had taken a break from college.  Yeah.  And I was a nanny in Bedford, New York.  And I'm originally from the Midwest.  You know, they like their nannies from either foreign countries or the Midwest for some reason.  And I used to go into the city with some of the other nannies that worked on Westchester  County.  Yeah.  And one day I wanted to go into the city.  Nobody else could or wanted to.  So I had gone in by myself. 
[01:15:00]  I had previously met some guys from the city through another nanny.  Oh, boy.  They hung out with this group of guys in the city.  And we had gone, you know, out dancing with them before.  But I didn't really know them that well.  Right.  So I was in the city by myself.  I happened to run into this group of guys.  And they were like, well, we're going dancing.  Do you want to go with?  And I was like, sure.  And they said, well, do you want me to stay or do you want to come with us?  We have to go home and change.  And I'm thinking, okay, I'm alone in the city and it's getting dark. 
[01:15:30]  You know, do I stay by myself or do I go with this group of guys that I at least am acquainted  with?  Boy, you must have had to go through some guilt about your decision making for a while, eh?  Well, yeah.  I mean, obviously.  Well, here's the, you know what it taught me?  To trust my instincts.  Because I got on the train and when I got off the train, I knew I was somewhere I shouldn't  be.  There wasn't a white face anywhere. 
[01:16:00]  Were these black gentlemen?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  And you're a white...  There wasn't a white face anywhere.  Are you...  And you're a white girl?  Yeah.  You're a white girl and you went with three black guys to their place.  Well, and it gets worse.  Okay.  So I got off the train and my stomach is saying, get out of here, get out of here.  This isn't right.  I get to their supposed apartment.  And it's an abandoned building.  Uh-oh.  All right. 
[01:16:30]  And you're looking around going, you need some furniture.  This doesn't look right.  Electricity, cockroaches.  Oh.  That.  But the one guy who I had talked to more than the other two, you know, when we had gone  out with the other nannies previously.  Yeah.  He was like, he had put me in his bedroom and he said he had to leave.  So he said, stay here.  Don't open up the door.  And I thought, okay, this might be all right.  You know, he's looking out for me, right?  He's protecting me.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, they started coming.  Well, there was one real bad aggressor.  I think the rest were just, you know, joining in for the fun of it.  The rest.  How many actually got you?  Five.  And then when it was all said and done, yeah, I was beat with a pipe.  They stole my, you know, my CD.  I mean, they stole everything.  Holy shit.  Oral sex, anal sex, one after the other after the other.  It lasted for hours. 
[01:17:30]  And then when it was all said and done, they threw me out the window.  So I crawled, practically crawled.  Oh, and a guy said, a guy threw me a subway token.  Oh, well, all right.  How many years ago was this?  This was in the early 90s.  Early 90s.  It was a little over 10 years ago.  Did they ever go to jail, any of these animals?  Well, the worst part about it was when I made it to the subway, and this one black woman, 
[01:18:00]  all I remember her saying is, girl, I don't know what happened, but don't cry.  You're going to make it worse.  You're going to make it worse.  And somebody must have gone and gotten the subway police.  And before I'd let them take me to the hospital, I made them, in the ambulance,  I made them take me back by where it happened because I knew otherwise I would never find the place again.  Yeah.  And, you know, because I really only knew from the turns I made to, you know, from the subway.  That's pretty good thinking. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  And so I guess they had caught three of them right then, that night.  And I had gone back to New York to appear in front of the grand jury.  And, you know, and my family and friends, people are just so uncomfortable with it.  No shit.  And I'm like, I want to testify.  You know, it was wrong.  I made some bad choices, but, you know, these guys didn't have any right to do that.  Of course not.  And if they've done it to me, how many other girls are they doing it to, right?  So how did, did you testify? 
[01:19:00]  Well, I testified at the grand jury, but then on the day I was supposed to fly back to testify for the trial.  I mean, I was at the airport, and I get up to the ticket counter and find out that my ticket had been canceled.  And I call up the DA.  They plea bargained with all of them.  So what did they get?  Well, they got in the world.  They got a man in court. 
[01:19:30]  How many years?  Three years?  And that was the worst.  The other ones did about a year.  Yeah, I figured.  Fucking fat Nick's been sitting in jail for eight months for a bat attack, and a guy was going to steal something.  And that gang rape, they get fucking three years.  Hey, we got Julie from New York that wants in on this conversation.  Julie, you're on with Lori the Trucker.  Hi.  You know, I think she's full of shit.  Women who get treated this way are not able to just go and talk about it like this.  How do you know?  You know what?  Come on.  You know what?  I used to walk with ladies.  Hold on, hold on. 
[01:20:00]  One at a time.  One at a time.  Here's the bottom line.  The bottom line is I can talk about it like this because I've dealt with it.  I understand that what they did had nothing to do with me.  Was I naive and did I make some bad choices?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  But that, I could have been anybody.  It had nothing to do with me personally.  The only thing I had to do was grow up and learn how to adjust my choices.  All right.  Let's hear what Julie has to say.  Julie?  I used to work with sex offenders, and sex offenders are not a matter of hurting you. 
[01:20:30]  It's them.  It's their addiction.  However, working with victims as well, you're not able to call a national radio show and  just spew out that you are thrown out.  How do you know?  Everyone is an individual.  Once we get off the air, I will give you the phone numbers of my sister and my husband.  I think, Julie, you're wrong.  Yeah, Julie, I absolutely believe this woman.  You call them immediately.  Julie, I will give you the numbers of my sister and my husband.  Well, Julie, why would you say?  I'm a trucker, so I'm on the road. 
[01:21:00]  I'm not there.  I just don't think that women who have gone through that type of experience can just  call a radio show for the entire world now.  Maybe you're not smart, Julie, and don't know every cookie-cutter human being that reacts  the same way.  This woman, maybe this is a way that it's her own therapy.  Have you ever been through that experience, Julie, or a similar one?  I had, yes.  Okay, so you personally weren't able to go out and talk about it the way she is.  No.  But a lot of people go out and commit murders and then go on speaking tours about it because 
[01:21:30]  they're able to talk about it, and then a lot of people just lock it away and pretend  it never happened.  You can't just say that everybody's going to react the same way.  Huh?  I dealt with it.  I went through my hell.  I went through blaming myself.  I went through all...  Of course I went to therapy.  But first of all, Julie, don't ever tell me I'm full of shit because this is my life.  It happened to me.  I own it.  It has nothing to do with you.  All right?  I'm not saying it does.  Second of all, how long do you want me to be a victim? 
[01:22:00]  How long?  I don't want you to be a victim at all.  I just don't think that people who go through that are able to...  She is.  She is, Julie.  Of course they are.  The power to you.  The power to you, then.  Julie, let me ask you a question.  People who deal with it can.  When a burn victim, somebody who burns themselves, it's a horrible thing, very rarely is going  to make fun of it or talk about it.  Pryor burned himself horribly, almost died, went on stage and made fun of it.  Pryor's mother was a prostitute.  He made fun of it.  Now, most people whose parents are prostitutes, you'd say, well, no one could ever go up and 
[01:22:30]  tell the world.  Now, I know he's a comic and she's not, but this is an example of how one person will  handle it one way and lock it up, and another person will handle it another way, and maybe  it's therapeutic for her to talk about it.  I mean, I'm not a doctor, but you can't just lump that in and say that that's not real.  Yeah, I would say that it didn't happen because she's not reacting to it the way you think  she should, you know?  No, it's not even about locking it up or being therapeutic.  The bottom line is, I did what I needed to.  I went through, trust me, I went through hell.  I mean, I was in the hospital for two weeks, you know, and then I had therapy afterwards. 
[01:23:00]  I'm not saying that immediately after this that I didn't struggle, but I dealt with it.  And here's the bottom line.  How long do you want me to be the victim of rape?  I don't.  How long do I play that role, Julie?  I don't want you to be the victim of rape forever.  Okay, then.  But I just find it really hard to believe that you could do that.  Wait, Julie, you worked with sex offenders?  I'll see the phone numbers of my sister and husband as soon as we get off the air. 
[01:23:30]  Hold on.  I don't need to do that.  Yes, I did, in college.  Wait, and you were attacked or something bad happened to you before that or after it?  Before that.  So you were hurt by people.  Right, but I wanted to try to, my way was to try to figure out what was going on.  Okay, now most people would say if you're attacked by a sex offender, by one of these animals,  that you'd never want to put yourself in the lion's den again.  And there you went right into it and dealt with them. 
[01:24:00]  You're absolutely right.  Now, most people probably could not do that.  Right.  So maybe her way of dealing with it is her way of being who she is.  Okay.  My reason for calling was to say it's not up to someone else to put a label on, you know,  like try to make all of us victims forever and ever.  I mean, I think the whole thing, when you think about it, was so absurd.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, it is almost funny. 
[01:24:30]  It was so ridiculous.  Wow.  Please don't tempt me.  Yeah, right.  Please.  The self-restraint in Opie's finger.  I know.  I know what she's saying, though.  I'm saying both right now.  It's just, it's an awful thing.  And you got to, like, you got to laugh at it at times because it's just, it's fucking,  it happened and it's monstrous.  Laurie, a lot of people are on the phone, Laurie, a lot of people are on the phones asking,  why didn't you just bite it off when you were doing the oral thing?  See, honestly, you almost go like on, it's true that you almost go on autopilot. 
[01:25:00]  The survival instinct, that's one thing that I learned.  It's unbelievable.  It's almost like an out-of-body experience.  And when I realized that there was no way I was going to get out of this by fighting,  it's almost like I went out of body into this survival mode and you just do what you need  to do to survive.  Plus, it's four guys, right?  Or three guys, not one guy.  If it's one guy, you can bite his dick.  But if it's five guys, there's other guys there.  What do you think they're going to do?  Just stop?  Yeah, and this one guy was huge and I was being beat with a lead pipe. 
[01:25:30]  Jesus.  Fucking animals.  And I'm not a big girl.  So as soon as your mind kind of works like a computer, you know, okay, shit, I'm in trouble.  You know, that's the first thing.  And then how am I going to get out of this?  And then it's like, okay, I'm not going to be able to get out of here.  Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Did the guy that told you to lock yourself in, was he a part of it or did he leave?  He did not rape me. 
[01:26:00]  He left.  So what I think happened was he had set me up for it to happen.  Why did he tell you not to open the door?  Or he was afraid of the other guy.  Right.  And just wasn't able to stand up.  Yeah, they were probably like, hey, you know, this chick's ours, don't get in the way.  And he was like, all right, I'm out of here.  Right.  How does that make you feel these days about black people?  What?  How does it make you feel these days about black people? 
[01:26:30]  Has it affected you?  Your racial whatever I'm looking for.  Racial, do you profile black guys when you see them?  Like, hello?  Hello?  Laurie's still there.  Not any more than any other northern Minnesota person who wasn't raised around them.  Extremely racist, then.  I don't know.  Northern Minnesota is Minneapolis.  Pretty liberal city.  I mean, I don't know how northern.  I'm from way north, Minnesota.  Okay.  She found the whitest place to live, basically.  Hey, Lauren, what's up with your sex life now? 
[01:27:00]  Can you enjoy it?  Actually, I went through a phase where I was really just, you know, out there.  I mean, I was a slut.  After that?  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Probably figured, eh, fuck it.  Once I'd gone through, like, the, you know, the worst of the therapy and all that, I didn't freeze up like I hear some women do.  I went the other direction. 
[01:27:30]  And I actually, you know, and right now, I mean, I'm pretty liberal sexually.  I like to experiment.  There's nothing that I wouldn't try.  If I like it, I'll do it again.  You're a banger comic?  Sure, Jimmy.  Do you have fantasies?  What?  Oh, yeah.  I do the rape fantasy.  That's sort of what I was getting at, but I really didn't want to say it.  Did you, do you, now, is that just the way, because, like, I'm a perv. 
[01:28:00]  Like, I'm a real pervert, and I love stuff like that, but it's really hard to enjoy it if you know it's hitting somebody in a really horrible place.  Like, if somebody is reenacting a fantasy or something because they're dirtbags like I am, it turns me on.  But if it's somebody's survival mechanism, then, to me, it's kind of sad.  Like, you know what I mean?  If I'm with a girl who's been raped or had a horrible thing and she's reenacting it only as a way to not fucking break down.  It's like a hard way of conquering it, then that's kind of sad to me. 
[01:28:30]  No, I mean, my sexual fantasies aren't any different than any other woman.  I mean, the rape or, you know, just somebody who's been authority is also a big one for me.  You know, like reverting back to my teenage years and, you know, a school teacher.  Right.  Those are, so, no, it's not like, oh, I'm reliving the rape through my sex.  I mean, I like, you know, I like my hair being grabbed and my ass being smacked. 
[01:29:00]  I don't like being punched in the mouth during sex.  Okay.  Are you married?  Yeah, I am.  And were you married when this happened?  No.  Okay.  No.  All right, Laurie.  Well, thanks for calling.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Let's thank Laurie for calling.  And let's say hi to Alex in Virginia.  Alex?  Hey, yeah.  I was going to ask her if these guys may have had lacrosse sticks with them, but she said  they're black, so I guess not.  Oh. 
[01:29:30]  Good Lord.  Let me hug up.  Goddamn pal talk.  What's the matter, sweet angel?  All the Arabs came in to jerk off to the story.  Jesus, these Arabs will spank to anything.  What the hell is going on with the Arabs in the pal talk room?  They love jerking off.  Of course they do.  Can you say?  Not that their culture's not freeing.  You know, I mean, when you're seeing eyes until you're 18, and then you fucking see an 
[01:30:00]  elbow, you want to just fucking eat it.  All right.  Let's go to Amy real fast.  Amy?  Hey, yeah.  I just wanted to say that that Julie woman is out of her damn mind.  I was raped for a couple of years when I was a kid.  I was really young, like 30 when I was like 11.  And I'm at the point now, I'm going to be 21 actually on Monday, and I can talk about  it, and I can tell people what I went through.  And, you know, it's just, it doesn't, the lawyer woman was exactly right when she said  that, you know, you can't be a victim forever. 
[01:30:30]  You know, you have to accept this, and you have to know that, you know, it had nothing  to do with you, and you have to be able to talk about it.  And how she was saying how she is sexually, I'm exactly the same way.  And it's really funny.  Where do you live?  Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania.  You're 20, and you're a bit, you're promiscuous?  Very.  I like you.  I like you too, Jimmy, actually.  Jimmy's email address is, just hand it out.  Yeah, don't, don't, it's not important, yellowtreats at AOL.com.  You don't need to write to me there. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  But no, see, and Julie's not, look, Julie.  I have no problem with Julie.  She can't believe that people would be that honest.  What's wrong with that?  I just didn't like the way she didn't believe, Lauren.  There's people out there that have horrific things happen to them, and they're not going to  call a freaking national talk show and talk about it openly.  I don't think Julie was far-fetched with her, with what she was saying.  I didn't like the way she made, like, said, I don't believe Lauren.  Like, that is the only problem I had with it.  No, to call up and say that somebody's full of bullshit is totally not appropriate.  You know, people handle things differently.  What's your name, Shudart?  What's your name, Shudart? 
[01:31:30]  Amy.  Amy, okay.  Sorry.  Yeah.  If you don't agree with something, you know, you can't say, oh, you're full of bullshit.  There's, you know, there's ways of going about that, and that just wasn't cool, you know,  and that's what pissed me off and made me call.  Who was the person that did those awful, who did rotten shit?  Was it a family member or a friend of the family?  It was actually a guy who was close to my age who lived across the street from me.  Oh, so it wasn't an adult.  It was, not that that makes it any better, I guess, but.  No, no, it wasn't.  Actually, it makes it a little more twisted because I have to wonder what was going on 
[01:32:00]  in his life.  Right, right, right.  For him to do some sick shit like that.  Now, does that, that you said you're kind of like she is, did that something that helped  develop fantasies in a certain way, or does that, like, kind of push you completely away  from that, like, when you're being sexual?  It's hard to say because it happened when I was so young, and I didn't really have any  sexuality at all when it was happening, but I can definitely say that immediately after  that stopped, when I was about 14 or 15, I did become very promiscuous because it had 
[01:32:30]  kind of taken away all the meaning behind sex, and so it didn't matter, and I'd do it with  anybody.  You know, older people, people my age, didn't matter.  And then I fell into a more serious relationship, and I was really screwed up, and it took me  a lot of time to kind of get my sexuality to a more, I guess, you know, acceptable level  where it wasn't like, beat the shit out of me with your belt.  It was more like, okay, slap me on the ass, pull my hair a little bit, you know. 
[01:33:00]  But like she said, I don't like to be punched in the mouth.  But when I was 14 or 15, I might have put up with that just because, you know, that's  what I was used to.  I'd belt you now that you're 20, though.  Believe me, I would spank your bottom, and I would redden it properly.  I would love that, Jimmy.  I've been trying to come to one of your shows for a long time.  I think she's very sexy.  As long as you're not doing it for awful reasons, I would be very happy to discipline  you.  Jimmy will be at Bananas in Poughkeepsie this weekend. 
[01:33:30]  Or I will be in Boston May 12th, and tickets went on sale today at Ticketmaster.  Me and Dave Attell at the Boston Orpheum.  And I'm sure he'll be very lonely in between shows, Amy.  Kenny rubs my back nude in my room.  No, and it's definitely not for awful reasons anymore.  You know, it's just because, you know, that experience might have been stiffed me a little  bit, but, you know, it doesn't hurt anymore.  You know, it's not going into a bad place and, you know, dredging up.  I don't cry during sex, you know what I mean?  It's not like that anymore. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, you go with me when you realize how awful it is.  Jesus, I can't believe I fucked this zilch.  All right, Amy.  Bye, Amy.  Email Jimmy.  Thanks for calling.  He'll be checking his email every five minutes now for the entire rest of the show.  So, Ant, what happened over there?  I saw you freaking out of it.  Hold on.  Well, this will set it up, actually.  John on Long Island.  John.  Friday morning on a very special ONA.  Oh, shit.  Marron.  Is this being simulcast on Lifetime?  There's a guy on hold in 90s.  I was kidnapped at gunpoint. 
[01:34:30]  Three guys raped my girlfriend.  Holy Jesus.  Do we want more of these stories?  They are hot.  We very rarely go down this road.  I don't think it's a...  And then Anthony, like, just shut down pal talk because why?  Oh, you think I want to turn my head when we're touching on, yes, subject matter we probably  haven't touched on ever, and girls are telling some stories that are a little shocking.  Some people might find them hot. 
[01:35:00]  Jesus.  Well, you know, I'm being honest.  When you take the tragedy out of the mix, there are pornos that are made with, you know,  the same subject matter.  Yeah.  In the words of Homer, it's hot because we don't know them.  Right.  Exactly.  It's one of those things.  So I got to sit there and then look at pal talk, boring, Anthony, move on from this  subject.  Like some dick bag is telling us what we should fucking...  They're directing the show from pal talk. 
[01:35:30]  So I said, you know something?  I typed, fuck you all.  Boom.  Close the room.  Good.  Bye.  Go find them.  Bye.  Now you can sit and not fucking listen on pal talk.  Go subscribe now.  There you go.  Subscribe to fucking XM you want to hear the show.  Or if you don't, flush it down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and go take your mother to the  fucking Bronx and have five black guys rape her.  You know, that's what amazes me about this radio show.  Then go find a morning zoo. 
[01:36:00]  Who's turning off their radio?  They want to move on.  Hey, Anthony.  Anthony.  Opie, thank you.  Anthony, move on from this subject.  Oh, well, Dickface3 from fucking pal talk has told me to move on.  Guys, stop the conversation.  Let's move on.  I know.  Some of our listeners are very spoiled.  By the way, when someone else opens my room, I get a message that says your room was opened  by, because some admins have the ability to open the room. 
[01:36:30]  If I see that admin, I don't care who you are, how friendly you are with the show, you  will be banned permanently from the room.  So you best reclose the room.  It is not being open for the rest of the show.  Rest of the show?  Rest of the fucking show.  How about you calm down a little bit?  Let me see if I calm down.  Yeah, let's see if you calm down.  But if that room is opened by somebody, I don't care who it is.  Banned.  What the hell happened?  I'm going to check right now to see if someone opened the room.  If someone opened that room, Anthony is going to take his shirt off and sweater so he can 
[01:37:00]  reach the keyboard and he is going to fucking ban you.  Oh, shit.  You bet.  Let me see.  Let me see.  What happened to you, Anthony?  I don't know.  Look, he's going to bedside again.  Look at that.  No one opened it.  Look at it.  Look, look, look.  Admit.  Admit.  Console.  Closed.  Room.  Bye-bye, everybody, again.  Bye.  Nope.  Don't you open that fucking room.  Here's the thing.  And now let's clear up a thing.  People are going to think, what, they can't be criticized? 
[01:37:30]  Exactly.  Right.  You know, people like to speculate.  Yes.  Jimmy's absolutely right.  What, do you want it to be all praise?  Yes.  Yes.  It's what we want.  Damn, that Jim was good today.  Exclamation point.  That's right.  Did you hear Ann's joke about them dot, dot, dot, dot, dot?  We have fragile egos.  We certainly do.  Why else do you think we take a call every once in a while where it's just them praising  us?  Yeah.  You know what?  That's just to build us up a little bit.  Do you understand?  We put the pal talk on so people can watch, join in, and enjoy the show. 
[01:38:00]  It doesn't make you the fucking producer of the show.  We have a pro...  Oh, okay.  Well, maybe...  All right.  All right.  I'll do that job.  Look, we're looking for a producer, but to look over there as I'm trying to listen to  that woman's story and just see, boring, move on.  Why?  Well, because it's not entertaining you personally.  Holy shit.  But as far as radio goes... 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  Who's turning that off?  The woman's talking about getting a train uptown and then five black guys luring her into  an abandoned...  You know, I hate to say this, but my God, was she asking for it.  You know what it was?  Jesus Christ.  Just come on, ladies.  A little thought.  I can't wait for the video game myself.  Oh.  You don't want to be...  San Andreas.  You're taught that you're not supposed to be judgmental.  Right.  You're taught that you're not supposed to be...  Well, and she said her gut, though, did tell her.  Right?  When she says that, all I'm thinking is, how stupid...  And, you know, maybe this is awful of me.  And who...  I'm just thinking, oh, my God, what woman is putting herself in this fucking situation? 
[01:39:00]  And she brought us right in.  Who else wasn't on the train with her?  Seriously.  Yeah.  I'm not even trying to make a joke.  Like, all of a sudden, she's saying, uh-oh, and she's on the train realizing, now she's  looking around.  There are days we know we stink where we deserve the, you know, move on, try something new,  be funny, but that's what I don't get.  When it's, like, radio gold like that, no one's turning off the radio.  Does it have to be a fucking dick joke or something?  Can't we just talk about a subject that pops up? 
[01:39:30]  What do you think?  What do you think?  This was on a prep sheet?  Hey, take the rape call.  Yeah, that was scheduled for this time.  It's not the way this show works, assholes.  And that's why we're great.  That's right.  That's right.  Subjects come up, we roll with it.  Easy come, easy go.  And by the way, why would it be on the prep sheet?  That would require prep.  And there's so many radio shows out there trying to figure out why we're so successful. 
[01:40:00]  This is it.  This is the reason.  Because we don't prep.  We don't.  We just go with the flow.  You have to be brave enough to just go with the flow.  Go with it.  We don't have a schedule.  We don't have sports that we go to or a weather break or a news break.  Right.  And also, we might go, let's talk about sports.  Right.  And then we do.  Mm-hmm.  That's what we do.  That's how it works.  And it's interesting to listen to.  I mean, how do you not want to hear?  I mean, we goof on everything.  We're garbage.  But a woman's talking about an awful thing like that.  What are you going to do?  Not want to hear it? 
[01:40:30]  Hey, that's boring.  Come on, man.  And don't worry.  Opie had his finger on the laugh button.  And it was ready to go.  We were all looking.  We were close.  It was closer than the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Yeah.  I was fighting with myself like I've never fought with myself before.  But then we figure we take the other way.  And I'm looking around the room.  I'm like, Jimmy.  And he's like, I'm like, Anthony, just listen to the story.  And then there was a part of the story where I said, you know what?  I can't do this.  Yeah, it was right.  I've got to be honest.  I'm like, I can't.  There was a perfect spot for it, too.  I know.  Oh.  I think it was when she said I got beat by a... 
[01:41:00]  Beat by...  And they threw me out the window.  And there was silence?  No.  But when she said she was getting beat by a pipe...  The pipe?  That's when I backed off.  I'm like, you know what?  This is just unbelievable on its own.  And I totally expected to hear De Niro.  I was dying.  I saw your finger over the button.  It was shaking.  It was shaking.  I was dying.  It's like you lifted that red cover up.  It started blinking red.  Meep, meep, meep.  Get on the hotline.  We're in F-Con.  Hold on a second.  I just want to look at Studio 54 that just wandered in. 
[01:41:30]  That fucking shirt.  What the hell?  Oh, Iraq, put the camera on it.  Oh, that's right.  You can't fucking see it.  It's a black, shiny shirt with silver, awful, tribal markings on it.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  What tribe would that be?  The fucking Cherokee cock lovers?  That is awful, that shirt.  Perhaps that's who came up with this.  This is another eBay special.  I love it.  I'm really enjoying these shiny shirts. 
[01:42:00]  You're less than a year away from wearing bow ties.  Maybe.  That's funny.  Come on.  I only wear bow ties.  A year away from wearing bow...  Nothing.  Why would you wear bow ties?  It would be an odd way of dress.  Yeah, it's odd.  I'm not...  I don't know.  Is the bow tie being gay?  I don't...  That was the only one I had today.  I'm sorry, Opie.  I have to crash you.  Hold it, but I...  I don't have anything else today.  That was the one I wrote.  Sunglasses perched on the head in that shirt.  Jesus Christ.  It's my look. 
[01:42:30]  That doesn't say apartment on 23rd Street.  Nothing does.  Oof.  And I brought in a new Ramon promo, though.  Oh, that's great.  You did?  I did.  Well, let's listen to the new Ramon promo.  It's 1995.  Exactly.  Get out of here.  Hey, uh...  How did you put that on this morning?  I should talk.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  At least this wasn't fucking painted on.  You know, it's doing your green body paint.  What is the irony going on?  That's not even a sweater.  He was at OzFest last week, and they painted it on, and he left it on. 
[01:43:00]  Sweater has nipples.  No, I wear an undershirt.  Hey, just so I can learn from my mistakes and maybe become a better comedian, if I said  he was a year away from wearing an ascot, would that have been a thing?  Oh, ascot is good.  Can we ask that's a faggier thing?  Because a bow tie, honest to God, I think of Nation of Islam.  I think of like...  I was thinking like more of a tuxedo, so classy wear.  Yeah.  Or like something silly.  Ascot.  Yeah.  A kerchief. 
[01:43:30]  Maybe a chuckle at least.  A kerchief would have worked.  Like Charles Nelson Reilly used to wear.  A dress would have made us all sad due to the reality of it.  What's your Ramon promo, Steve?  Oh, boy.  Who cares?  It's a new type of Ramon promo.  I'm really trying to experiment, so I'm working on another one right now.  You can say that again.  Thank you.  Good.  I'm trying to experiment with new things, so I don't even understand the Ramon thing  has morphed into something with Jimmy, and we don't need the promos anymore. 
[01:44:00]  I don't know.  No, I like the idea of...  Because it is Steve's creation.  Thank you.  And it is Steve's life.  He is Steve.  And I believe...  Who was it that named Steve from Yellowstone?  I won't even take credit for that.  It was Derek.  I'm calling in from that room.  And I'm like, I need a name, Steve.  And now he goes, from Yellowstone.  And I'm like, ah, there it is.  So fucking Derek.  Good job.  No credit.  Fucking job.  Very good.  All right.  Derek came up with the name.  You want to hear the new Ramon promo?  I would love to.  Please.  Trekking through the Himalayas is quite exhausting, but the views are breathtaking. 
[01:44:30]  So tired.  So famished.  Great Scott.  My Sherpa has collapsed.  Ramon.  Fillet this Chinaman.  I kind of like that.  That was all right?  I kind of like it.  I like the Ramon.  Fillet this Chinaman.  Fillet this Chinaman would have been better.  But no, he wouldn't say Chinaman.  All right.  Who wouldn't? 
[01:45:00]  Deep voice guy.  Oh, you're right.  I apologize.  New development.  My apologies.  New development.  You hear this?  Yeah.  What's that?  So tired.  You hear that?  That is somebody streaming the show on another channel on PalTalk.  I am taking his name.  You are now permanently banned from when we do go back.  Right there.  Copy that name down.  Give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  Somebody give the boss a pen.  You will never.  The boss needs a pen.  Six pens went flying in, Anthony.  This new power trip. 
[01:45:30]  There you go.  Really scary.  All right.  John K3U, he's streaming the show.  You're now banned from the live room forever.  And I'll keep checking back.  Whoever's streaming the show gets banned.  I'm sure you will.  I don't take shit.  I'll say you don't.  There you go.  Next.  Anyone else want to be in line?  Anybody else?  That fucking Opie and Anthony fan room is not streaming the show.  Oh.  Give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  That's right.  Whoever gets a fucking mic in that room is banned. 
[01:46:00]  I swear to you, I don't care how friendly you are with me.  Gone.  This fucking man in his short-sleeved sweater will fucking ban you in a second.  I'm not kidding.  He's practicing speeches in front of mirrors again.  Of course he is.  You all right, Ian?  I will check in.  I am fine.  I got that name.  I see you got the info.  Banned.  That's great.  Banned.  Hope you enjoyed the show on PalTalk.  You'll never see it again.  All right.  Let's...  Ow. 
[01:46:30]  Bastard.  What's that?  I think a break.  You got a rule with an iron fist.  All right, listen.  Tyra, South Park, all aboard with Rosie O'Donnell, the gay cruise.  The gay cruise.  We learned some very interesting things about gay people before the show today.  One of my regrets, I don't regret a lot of things, but I wish I hadn't bad-mouthed Rosie  on Tough Crowd.  Why?  Because she was really nice to me when I met her, and when I heard when she's done with 
[01:47:00]  her, I mean, her show was kind of like, blech, but then she's fucking bashing Michael Jackson.  It's like, God damn it, I like her.  I really do.  But she...  Not for any reasons of anything, other than the fact that I like her.  Bobby, get the fuck out.  No, no, no.  She's...  You're banned.  Banned from the show.  No, because she's...  Just because she's fucking...  When she said to Michael...  No, I didn't talk to Michael Jackson.  I don't speak to pedophile.  Like, she just fucking is brutal.  Hey, did she come out of the closet on her own show?  She came...  No, she came out after it was over.  I would have had so much respect for her. 
[01:47:30]  I understand...  I know.  I understand how Hollywood works and entertainment works, so, you know, that would have been a  death sentence if she all of a sudden started telling those fat housewives that believe  that she really is in love with Tom Cruise, that she's gay.  But when she knew the show was ending, like, the last week, the last few shows, I would  have had so much more respect if she did it then.  She was done with that project.  I don't know.  She might have, though.  I actually don't remember.  But it's like, that's why I don't have respect for her.  If she did it then, that would have been cool.  It was like, that chapter was done, that project was done, and then it's like, all right, 
[01:48:00]  it's time to tell the world.  The week she came out, we were doing Colin Quinn's show, and she actually was on the panel.  Remember, we would do that town hall thing.  We would all sit there.  I didn't badmouth her on that one.  I mean, on a later time.  This was the Colin Quinn show.  And I remember she was saying something about, Colin wanted to do a sketch with her about  something, where, like, she was trashing him as a husband, and she's like, look, I just  came out.  If I start doing this, they're going to think, oh, great, she's beating up on men already.  Like, she didn't want to do it because she was like, I just came out of the closet, and  it's just going to sound stupid.  So it was like that recent.  I don't know where that story's going. 
[01:48:30]  Probably nowhere.  But besides, you know, that, she is saying some great, vicious stuff, man.  She's got some major balls on her now.  I don't like her agenda-driven shit that she gets into, though.  Like, it's great.  Yeah, the Michael Jackson thing, she confronts him as a pedophile and is brutal on him.  That's fine and everything.  But then she gets a little too political and a little too high and mighty with her politics.  You can have an opinion.  That's fine.  Have an opinion.  Trade little ideas back and forth.  But she is so adamant. 
[01:49:00]  That whole fight she got into with Tom Selleck when she had him on the show about gun control,  I mean, that was just a blindsiding.  It's on her terms, and he was blindsided by her, and it's agenda-driven.  Have your opinion.  But she goes a little too far.  How long has her show been off the air?  I guess like five years.  Is it that long already?  It's got to be.  No, I'm sorry.  No, it's not.  It's not.  It's actually three and a half.  Okay. 
[01:49:30]  No, it's not.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Because it was already off the air by the time we did that Colin Quinn show, and believe  me, they were all-  Was it really?  Yeah.  That Colin Quinn show seems like it was years ago.  No, it was after 9-11.  I remember some of the material we were doing.  It was after the LA-  No, well, that was LA Roger a long time ago.  That was 94.  It wasn't?  Mm-hmm.  Right now, the inside of my colon is ready to empty.  Yeah, we got to-  Rosie O'Donnell went off the air in 2002.  She was on for six years.  Thank you, E-Rock. 
[01:50:00]  Four years.  Oh, so I said five.  You said three and a half.  Let's just meet in the middle and touch helmets.  All right.  Chew Boogie, get us out of here for a little bit.  We'll be right back. 
[01:50:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:51:00]  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:51:30]  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:52:00]  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  That's amazing.  Nice.  It's just amazing.  Drew Boogie live in studio today.  Comes in every once in a while and mixes some of our favorite clips.  Nice.  And with his music, it's just great.  Let's say hi to James, the trucker. 
[01:52:30]  James, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hi.  Hey, Jimmy, you're a little high strong this morning, ain't you?  Me?  Hell yeah, man.  Earlier.  Don't open that goddamn room.  You're my one.  Yeah, goddamn, dude.  That was Anthony.  I didn't understand that that was me.  That was not me, sir.  I don't wield with an iron-blood germ-free fist.  How long have you been listening to the program?  I've had my XM for about a month now, so I've always listened to you guys for a couple weeks,  and I love you guys.  Thank you, man.  All right, so you don't really recognize the voices yet. 
[01:53:00]  That was Anthony.  That was Anthony.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Yeah, Anthony, you're high-strong as a motherfucker, man.  Well, they get me.  I'll make it very easy for you.  Anything you hear that's really funny on the show, that would be me, Opie.  Any impressions of me, Norton, that's right, and any just yelling and mean-spirited ramblings  would be either Anthony or Hawke.  Okay, okay, I got you, got you.  Now, with all that stuff this morning, man, I don't know if you guys want this. 
[01:53:30]  Bye-bye.  Yes, we got other things to do.  We certainly do.  And you'll learn who that always is as you continue to listen to the show.  Let's go to Mike in New Hampshire.  Mike.  Uh, what's an ascot?  It's kind of, um, uh, that's the last thing Lacey said.  Is it kind of gay that you know that?  Not really, like, I think, I think ascot, an ascot is what, uh, Charles Nelson Riley used 
[01:54:00]  to wear.  Yeah, it's like something Mr. Howell wears.  It's like a, uh, what is it, like a silky, it's a silky scarf.  Silky scarf, but it's kind of tucked into your jacket.  Yeah.  Around your neck.  You know?  Thank you for the, uh, description.  It's the sign of the homo.  Yes.  It's a jizz catcher.  You're not going to see anyone from the NFL wearing one of those.  No.  Unless you're on a gay cruise with a Rosie O'Donnell.  The Rosie Cruz.  Yeah.  That football player.  You guys are kicking ass today. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Doug in Arkansas.  Hey guys, for a fucking show where you're supposed to be coasting, you're really bringing  it to the fucking table this morning.  Thank you, sir.  Wow.  Even when we coast, we're terrific.  Can I ask Jimmy a question real quick?  You feel free to ask anybody anything that you wish to ask.  Do you feel like in comedy that, uh, maybe somebody that's more of a victim, like somebody  that does cancer jokes, but is a cancer survivor, that's more okay than somebody that just does 
[01:55:00]  cancer jokes just to do them.  It's acceptable.  Why is that acceptable?  Everyone in comedy should do cancer, should be able to do cancer jokes.  I hate that.  I'm not kidding.  I hate that shit.  I think he's asking.  I don't think he's saying.  I think he's asking.  No, I know.  Well, I just had to, sorry, Jimmy, sorry.  No, no, no.  You're the expert on being on a fucking stage.  But that does frustrate me when it's like, oh, it's completely acceptable because, uh, the person  that's telling the cancer jokes on the stage had a tumor removed and that's why it's all 
[01:55:30]  right.  That's bullshit.  Because like Robert Schimmel does that and it bugs the shit out of me because they laugh  their ass off at him, but if somebody else does it, they're an evil fuck.  Well, and that's, and that's not about Schimmel.  That's about the, the problem is, and I think what you're saying is like the audience will  accept it from somebody a little bit easier.  Right.  Um, you know, I mean, I guess in some cases I understand that, but I mean, we've all been  affected by like, I don't have AIDS.  Uh, I make fun of it.  But to be honest with you, I've had people I love die of AIDS.  I mean, I'm in recovery.  So I like, I know guys that have, you know, I knew guys really well that, that, that got 
[01:56:00]  the virus when they were shooting dope and shit like that.  And then they died.  I mean, it's awful.  It's an awful thing.  So I'm making fun of something that has certainly fucking killed people that I love.  Yeah.  Not the laugh.  All right.  Well, I'm punching out.  I love you fuckers.  I've been listening for a little.  Uh, Cody in Indiana.  That would be Anthony.  Hey guys.  Uh, you did not give Anthony any recognition for a great fucking line that he threw out  today.  Why would we?  What did I say? 
[01:56:30]  During the, uh, the rape story that that chick had, she said, and I got on the train and you  said, you sure did.  That was a great line and I heard it and I didn't want to acknowledge it because what  would happen is this.  We would have completely become who we really are.  Speaking of train, it would have derailed the story and we would have just gone off and  made her cry.  Opsfinger wouldn't have hovered.  No, no.  She would have laughed good naturedly.  And yet deep down felt like, wow, why did I open up to these pigs? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  I fucking love you guys.  Punching out.  All right.  Thank you for the recognition, sir.  We interrupt this program to bring you.  The Ozone Nidget Sighting of the Day.  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  Because I know they're now reciting it with me at home.  Ed in Sacramento.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Ed.  And I got a dwarf sign for you guys.  There's a guy that works on my job site.  I'm sure he's an illegal Mexican. 
[01:57:30]  He's Mexican.  I'm sure he's illegal.  But, uh, this guy has got to be like two and a half feet tall and he wears this hammer  in his belt instead of, like, in a tool bag.  Yeah.  The same thing nearly drags the ground as he walks.  It's hilarious.  You'll wear a hammer belt so it's easily accessible on your hip like a holster almost.  And usually it hangs down just above your kneecap.  But on him, you're saying it's like leaving a tail trail.  He's walking around like a knight with a sword.  It's freaking hilarious to watch him. 
[01:58:00]  It's so funny.  That's what I just want to tell you, guys.  Take it easy.  Very good.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Where did Jimmy go?  He just got up and left.  Time to go fart in the control room, maybe?  Oh, I hope so.  No, he's got to check his email.  Are you kidding?  From that girl that...  Or he got an email and he just needs to...  He didn't even say anything this time, though.  He got very excited and just left.  He got up and walked off of the show. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Let's see.  Hello, who's this?  Hello?  You're on the air.  You're on the air.  Yeah.  Hello?  You didn't push the button.  Hello?  Hello?  Hold on a second.  All right.  There's something going on that says... 
[01:59:00]  Uh, who's this?  Hold on a second.  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you?  Uh...  Why can't he...  Yeah.  Gee.  All right.  Well, let's blow off that guy.  We interrupt this program to bring you...  The Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Who saw this coming?  Hello?  Hi.  This is Bonnie McFarland and I have a midget sighting.  I just woke up and realized who I married. 
[01:59:30]  Jesus.  Meanwhile, back at the show...  Two days in a row, we went...  We're going down the silly road.  What happened?  That's fantastic.  I mean, it was just a silly little thing that...  Someone called and we missed it.  All right.  Gentlemen.  We got Than in the studio.  Helps us out with getting all the great audio from TV.  Oh. 
[02:00:00]  And I saw something and I go, Than, please get this for the program.  I'm obsessed with Tyra Banks.  I'm so obsessed and not many people are jumping on this bandwagon with me yet, but she is this  just hot piece of ass.  We all know that.  But she has the biggest ego and it has to be all about her.  She doesn't even acknowledge that anyone else is walking around this planet, basically.  And she's a crazy person.  Yeah.  She's got a talk show now.  She's got America's Next Top Model that she does. 
[02:00:30]  So she's got two really hot TV shows right now.  But somehow, some way, she always brings it back to being about her.  Right.  It's all about her.  Tyra.  And she did something on America's Next Top Model that just made me laugh my ass off  because it just proves my point.  All right?  That it's all about her.  Should we just...  Is it best to just play the audio or explain what's going to happen here?  Well, we could play the audio and then explain it, perhaps. 
[02:01:00]  You think?  And then play it again.  Okay.  It'll use up more time.  And that's what this show's about.  It is Friday.  Especially on Coasting Friday.  All right.  Well, Tyra Banks on America's Next Top Model or whatever.  She started her show with this.  Hello.  Hi.  How is everybody?  See, she has to...  See, I just need to talk more about this.  She has to come in, make the grand entrance.  Grand entrance.  Always.  All these hot pieces of asses are just hanging around waiting for Tyra to show up. 
[02:01:30]  You know how Tyra's going to pick her for the spot of being the next top model?  You know how they work the camera when this is all happening?  Like, they show the contestants and the door.  Right.  And then Tyra walks through the door and the reaction.  Yeah.  They're all so happy to see her.  Yeah, it's got to be very dramatic.  Oh, very dramatic.  You can't just start with her hanging out in a room.  No, you're in the fucking room.  Start the show.  With the models, right?  She needs, like, an applause break every freaking show.  Of course.  Hello.  Hi.  How is everybody?  Good.  Is there pressure or anything? 
[02:02:00]  What's the hardest part of being in this competition?  Not knowing what's going to happen next.  Really?  Well, you guys are the top nine.  So, you've gotten this far.  So, is it hard walking into the judging room?  It's so cool.  I've been working so hard.  I'm so tired, you guys.  So, I'm so sorry, you guys.  I don't mean to be all weak in front of you, but I'm just so lightheaded.  Somebody bring some water.  Some peace.  I'm going to drink. 
[02:02:30]  I'm all right.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Please.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Come on, y'all.  Oh, my God.  Press her palm.  Pick her palm.  Oh, no.  I'm all right.  Today, you guys are going to learn about acting.  Come on.  Learn about acting.  Acting, acting, acting.  That was fake.  That was a good job.  Good job. 
[02:03:00]  Good job.  Good job.  That was a good job.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are you okay?  I can't be realistic.  I know.  I'm dying.  I think Tyra's too good of an actress, and that was a very mean trick that she played on  us.  Well, I did that because you guys are going to be learning all about acting this week, and  it's about being convincing, and it's about being real.  You have to be able to be in a commercial and say the words and be convincing.  All right?  So that is why I did this to show you've got to go for it, and you've got to commit. 
[02:03:30]  Do you know who should be doing a thing about acting?  Her producers and staff for not throwing up every time this cunt opens her mouth.  She's never acted in anything really good.  She's awful.  I don't even think she's ever had a speaking role on TV.  Dude, in a commercial.  Maybe, hey, I'm Tyra Banks, and here's Clarol's fucking mascara.  She was trying so hard to make it seem like she was acting, when all she did during that 
[02:04:00]  clip was she was sitting there, she sat down after she walked in, told people she felt a  little lightheaded.  The other models are looking around suggesting the water or something like that.  Pizza.  She put her head down between her legs.  And then she dramatically collapsed on the floor, and that's when you heard them all go,  Tyra!  Oh, my God!  Tyra!  Oh, my God!  Help her!  Oh!  Oh!  Because she fell on the floor. 
[02:04:30]  That was her acting.  And then she jumps up and says, you know, you're going to learn about acting today.  You're going to learn acting!  Acting, acting, acting!  And she said acting, acting, acting, because she's trying to sell it, because she realized  her little thing bombed horribly.  Yeah.  Bombed horribly.  It was...  But is it acting?  If you fall...  Like, if Drew Boogie is sitting there, and you just fell on the floor, we'd all go,  Oh, hey, Drew, you okay?  Hey, you know, are you fine?  No, we wouldn't.  No?  We'd keep going with the show.  I mean, the first break that came up.  Yes.  We'd probably say, are you okay? 
[02:05:00]  We wouldn't notice.  Hey, where's the scratching?  Uh-oh.  We would be saying, lucky us.  It's not acting.  There's one less.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  Do you know, Opie?  You are...  It's just...  ...horrific today.  I happen to love Drew Boogie, and we all love Drew Boogie.  I don't even see color when I look at Drew Boogie.  Why would you mention it anymore?  Okay.  You know, used to be.  Oh, the black guy.  We don't care.  You don't need eyes to see the color. 
[02:05:30]  You just have to use your ears.  What?  Because he can scratch.  Yeah.  You know...  Yeah.  Guys, let's not get to you.  Hate never is the answer.  All right, listen.  I like that, Jimmy.  I made that up.  That on a shirt.  Let's say hi to Reno in Mississippi.  Reno?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hi.  I was going to say, I'm glad you guys are back.  Really, really glad.  But anyway, I felt that one little snippet didn't get enough laughs.  I believe it was Norton was talking about Ascot, and he said it was used for an AIDS tourniquet. 
[02:06:00]  Which I thought was pretty much good.  Thank you, sir.  We reacted to that.  I think I got a hearty laugh out of the AIDS tourniquet.  You got a little chuckle from the background, but that's about it.  Sometimes, you see, we're all selfish, sir.  When a subject comes up, sometimes we're all, our minds are racing to find a joke, and someone comes out with a good one.  And we don't care, because we're thinking of our own.  What the fuck?  Why would the phone...  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Why would she write that?  Someone's got to keep the newspapers away from them. 
[02:06:30]  We try every morning.  No, I was acting.  Oh.  Oh, hey.  Oh.  Acting, acting, acting.  Acting, acting, acting.  Hey, what's the story on the paper?  Here's me acting.  Well, I wonder who wrote that.  I look up, my eyes open, who wrote that?  Wide open.  By the way, getting back to the selfishness and stuff,  and how the brain works when a subject, you know, hits,  and you can come up with a really good line.  I got actual audio of me thinking.  Ooh, let's hear it.  Of a good line.  Oh, shit. 
[02:07:00]  Oh.  Wouldn't it be funny if we were all, we were all just, like, cock-blocking undercutters?  Like, Sam, just this, like, let's say we're all going for a laugh on something.  Just, like, I'm talking, just interrupting.  Like, okay, so then this guy comes out.  Oh, man, in the paper I saw.  I'm talking!  So, listen, back to the tire bags thing and the acting, acting, acting. 
[02:07:30]  So, uh, did you happen to see this?  Whoa.  See, now you're a cutie yell, I'm talking.  I know, but I didn't feel like that.  But I went, ah, and then realized I'm doing nothing.  Yeah, you aren't the guy.  Ah, par for the course.  I'm sitting here reading the paper.  Can we play the tire a bit again now that everyone understands it?  So then she falls down, and she got a reaction, but she didn't expect one of the dopes to start crying uncontrollably.  So then she has to calm her down.  Ew.  So it backfired.  Hello. 
[02:08:00]  Hi.  How is everybody?  Good.  Is there any pressure or anything?  What's the hardest part of being in this competition?  Not knowing what's going to happen next.  Really?  Well, you guys are the top nine.  So you've gotten this far.  So is it hard walking into the judging room?  It's so hard.  I've been working so hard, I'm so tired, you guys.  So, I'm so sorry, you guys.  I don't mean to be all weak in front of you, but I'm just so lightheaded.  Oh, God. 
[02:08:30]  Come on, bring some water.  I'm all right.  Oh, God.  Please, help me now.  Please, what?  Oh, God.  Press her palm.  Kick her palm.  Oh, no.  I'm all right.  Today, you guys are going to learn about acting.  Learn about acting. 
[02:09:00]  Acting, acting, acting.  That was fake.  That was good job.  Good job.  Good job.  That was a good job.  I think, oh, are you okay?  I can't be real.  I know.  I think Tyra's too good of an actress, and that was a very mean trick that she played on  us.  Well, I did that because you guys are going to be learning all about acting this week, and  it's about being convincing, and it's about being real.  You have to be able to be in a commercial and say the words and be convincing. 
[02:09:30]  Say the words.  All right, so that is why I did this, to show you got to go for it, and you got to commit.  That's true.  God, I wish one of those dopes had a heart attack.  Oh.  And died.  Just dropped dead.  That fucking emaciated, whore model heart just stopped beating.  Right.  That's all I'll talk.  A little shock.  Tyra, please.  Waka.  Wah.  She's laying there fucking drooling on the side of her mouth.  Oh, that would make me so happy.  Do you get the douche chills, though?  Dude, when she went acting, acting, because it was like, ah, good job. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was really a weird acting moment.  It was just like Brando letting out that sigh when he found out Sonny was dead.  Oh, she should get off a fucking train and go into an abandoned building with five gentlemen.  We acting, bitch.  You know?  Yo, yo, mouth acting like a pussy.  Oh, all right.  Listen.  What did you bring in, waif?  Thanks.  This is a... 
[02:10:30]  That's right.  You see fucking sissy trying to open the door and have to use all of his body weight to pull open?  Oh, sissy.  Fucking Travis tries to open the door to get out, and he pulls, and then has to just go lean to the left until it finally comes with him.  It is really sad.  Oh, fucking paperweight.  What is she acted in?  Halloween Resurrection.  She was, uh...  Wasn't she like a girlfriend in Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?  Ooh.  For like a day?  Yep.  You've got to be a football hero.  Ninety-three.  She was in Higher Learning, right? 
[02:11:00]  Yep.  Higher.  Since Spike Lee joined her...  Well, as a lot of us speculated, she played Ketitia on an episode of Mad TV.  She was in the...  Her fucking resume is worse than mine.  Do you realize this...  If it wasn't for the fact that people wanted to fuck you, do you understand you...  I really should have had a funny thought there, but I just kind of petered out.  That was a semicolon.  It should have been a period.  We needed a sound effect of a car just running out of gas. 
[02:11:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah, old school.  When I said we need, I should have just said, Anthony, could you please?  No.  I can't.  And no credits count when it says herself.  Like playing herself.  Absolutely.  Which is 99% of her credits here.  But she's an actress.  She acted.  She fell down on the floor.  She was on the new Price is Right in 2006. 
[02:12:00]  Skinny horse.  She played Bob Barker's microphone.  All right.  Let's...  So then Tyra Banks does this talk show.  And she's really into these phobia shows.  I thought my Oprah line didn't get what it deserved either, by the way.  All right.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  No.  Someone out there enjoyed it.  It was very funny, but we couldn't...  We couldn't...  ...roll with it.  Yeah, we were...  Frank Vincent on the line.  I don't know.  He's probably uncomfortable.  You know, he's got a good job.  Holy...  Jimmy. 
[02:12:30]  I understand you need blow your nose, but...  I just...  Right on the microphone...  What?  The tissue.  You were blowing your nose directly into the mic.  Too bad.  Let the next show deal with it.  Hey, fuzz.  Fizz, you got a luger on your mouth.  Hey, fuzz.  I'll fuck both of those guys.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  Let's get into the Tyra Banks phobia show audio, volume two.  This is the second time she's done the phobia show.  All right.  Basically, she brings these dopes in.  Dopes.  And they got these weird fears.  And then Tyra, because she's an expert at this...  Yeah, Dr. Tyra steps in and uses her expertise to try to get these people over their fears.  Right.  So there's a fear of styrofoam.  Styrofoam.  A fear of garden gnomes.  Stop it.  Because they're on every front lawn. 
[02:13:30]  That's not true.  Right?  Tell me you're kidding.  And you threw that one in as a joke.  And then the one I saw, fear of ovens.  Fear of ovens.  Well, make your own joke, please.  Please make your own joke.  They all broadcast.  Here's Tyra's intro to the phobia show.  All right, everybody.  I recently did a...  Making it about her.  Thank you, Than, for writing that in the clip.  Because, yes, once again, she turns it around and makes it about her again. 
[02:14:00]  Because the show should have been, I helped some of my viewers get through their stuff.  Right.  She doesn't mention them once until, you know, after she talks about herself.  All right, everybody.  I recently did a show that was incredibly difficult for me.  Me.  For her.  And on that show, I finally faced my fear of dolphins.  And that was one of the hardest days of my life.  And since that show aired, the emails and phone calls and letters...  Is there anyone with me how this is so ridiculous?  The dumbest fear ever is the fear of a dolphin. 
[02:14:30]  Dear Tyra, please help me.  I have a fear of being blown by three girls at once.  Yes, I don't think my heart could take it.  Well, you just sit in that chair, little Jimmy, and let these three come over here and help you.  But dolphins.  They're so easy to avoid.  Exactly.  They're so easy to spot, first of all.  Oh, my God.  If you never want to be in contact with a dolphin, then you don't step in the water.  But you can even step in the water because you can even see the dolphins coming.  They have an unusual way of swimming.  It's not like a shark that's going to be cruising under the water and maybe bites your leg. 
[02:15:00]  Do you know there is a way, and this is very rare in this life and this world, there is  a way to guarantee 100% that you will not encounter a dolphin.  Yes, Jimmy?  Especially if you're black.  Oh, shit.  That's really good.  Come on.  How many today?  But that's a good one.  I like that.  And I feel I could do the black humor because I got Drew right there laughing really hard.  Drew quivers. 
[02:15:30]  Being used today, Jesus.  Laughing a little too hard because he just wants to fit in with the white people.  Oh, my God.  That's not true.  Drew's got a good sense of humor about everything.  Really does.  I got one more, and he's going to be knocked out.  You all right, Drew?  I'm fine.  All right.  I'm going to knock you out.  Everyone knows we love Drew.  Yeah, Drew's a very talented DJ and our friend.  Anyway, the fear of dolphins.  Yes, dolphins.  It's probably one of the things that is a 100% guarantee, which doesn't come across in 
[02:16:00]  this lifetime very often, that you will not encounter a dolphin.  By the way, I know why she has that fear.  I read her stupid book.  Really?  Yes.  You read her book?  That's right.  She was raped.  Magnificent bastard.  She was raped by Mark Duper.  Wow.  A Mark Duper joke.  He was a Miami Dolphin from the 70s.  All right.  I didn't know.  I'm sorry.  I'm standing.  Thank you, Opie.  Opie, standing ovation.  Thank you very much.  Because he went obscure dolphin. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Why didn't you just go with, you know.  Because last time this came up, I did a Marino joke.  You did.  Oh.  Fucking.  Ralph Redundant.  Fucking.  Chip, change the line.  All right.  So, so.  Why did Norton just be paying his lines?  We're never going to get.  You want me to ban somebody?  What?  I thought you wanted me to ban somebody that was being evil to you.  No. 
[02:17:00]  I'll do it.  No.  All right.  So, the dolphin thing.  Yeah.  I can't get past.  No.  I just can't bet.  It's a stupid fear.  And she makes it so dramatic.  It's a fucking dolphin.  I got over my fear.  All right, everybody.  I recently did a show that was incredibly difficult for me.  And on that show, I finally faced my fear of dolphins.  And that was one of the hardest days of my life.  And since that show aired, the emails and phone calls and letters and even videos have  been pouring in from so many viewers who are ready to confront their phobias, too. 
[02:17:30]  Now, here's a look at just a few of the phobia confessions that we received.  Now, they might seem funny to you.  But believe me, these fears are 100% real.  My fear is rabbits.  I'm terrified when people touch me.  I have the worst fear of velvet.  Garden elves.  Beats.  Mascots.  People don't understand how bad this fear really is.  It freaks me out.  It gives me the chills.  This is a real fear.  We have a fear of being prepared. 
[02:18:00]  Right.  We never face it.  Ben has a fear of actually seeing single.  Where is Ben?  Is he here today?  He's a little under the weather.  This is Ben sick.  Yeah.  I want to tussle his hair.  How can he be under the weather with that huge head?  Doesn't it go into the stratosphere?  Where is he? 
[02:18:30]  Oh, I see his head.  He doesn't want to be bothered.  Highlight.  Highlight.  Highlight.  Highlight.  What do you highlight?  Don't.  Highlight.  He's looking at pictures.  It's just nonsense what he does.  Highlights.  Don't.  I talked about that.  It's a highlight.  Messy desk.  I found.  What?  Yeah.  How do you look so busy all the time and nothing gets accomplished?  You take your mouse and you left click. 
[02:19:00]  Here's what Ben does all day.  Do it at home right now.  Whatever is in front of you on your monitor, just left click your mouse and drag so the text  is highlighted.  And now click off the text and unhighlight.  That's what you do all day.  Repeat for four hours.  That's right.  All right.  Listen, let's get back to Tyra.  So we got the fear of styrofoam.  Right?  Yes. 
[02:19:30]  Styrofoam.  Now for most of us, receiving a big package in the mail is something that we look forward  to.  Yes, we do.  But for Arne, an unopened box only means that her worst nightmare is lurking inside.  Oh, what's in the box?  Severed head.  So tell us what you're dreading.  What is your fear?  I have a really serious phobia and it's with styrofoam.  Styrofoam.  What happens when you see styrofoam?  That's terrific.  It's really hard for me.  I don't like to be around it.  And whenever I encounter it, my first reaction is to get away from it as soon as I can. 
[02:20:00]  If I physically can't get away from it, then I close my eyes, I scream, whatever I can  do to distract myself from it.  Are you shook up?  Are you nervous?  Do you know what I have a fear of?  I have a fear of Tyrofoam.  That's when a box is sent to you and your item is protected by a self-indulgent twat.  Oh, no, there's Tyrofoam in the box.  I really didn't know where I was going with that one. 
[02:20:30]  I liked it.  Thank God it landed on funny.  Yes.  I'm going to start whispering my punchlines just to make you listen.  All right, ready for more of this crap?  Yes.  Why do you think you're so scared of Tyrofoam?  It's been, I've been dealing with it for a really, really long time, but I can remember  being about five or six and my grandfather chewed tobacco and there was all these spit  cups around, you know, and I'm always seeing these little Tyrofoam cups. 
[02:21:00]  I'm like, you chewed tobacco and then spit it in the cups.  I know.  So there's these Tyrofoam cups everywhere and my mother's going, don't touch it, don't  go near it, don't, you know what I mean?  So I'm hearing this, don't touch it, don't go near it.  And so I'm just kind of like, from then on, I think maybe that's where it came from.  No, here's where it came from.  Yeah.  You're on the right track.  Grandpa used a Tyrofoam cup.  So you'd wake up at three in the morning with a burning in your bottom and chin stubble  in your back.  And as you look to the left and pretended you were eating cotton candy while whatever went 
[02:21:30]  on, went on, all you could focus on was grandpa's Tyrofoam cup, which had magically  appeared on your nightstand.  Right.  And you'd feel bottom sore, bottom sore, hand grabbing cup.  Bottom sore, bottom sore, cup put back.  I look forward to the Drew Boogie remix of that.  Wow.  You heard the rhythm in there, right, Drew?  I like that.  I can use it.  I didn't mean to make it hot, but I think that's what happened.  Well, let's say hi to Eric in Jersey.  Eric. 
[02:22:00]  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Good morning there, Joaquin Norton.  Hey, that's good.  All right.  I like that, Eric.  I believe her whole audience have a phobia, job-a-phobia.  Her whole job-a-phobia.  That's funny.  I wanted to smash it because he said I believe her whole audience have a, but then he had  a good one.  That was a good one.  Amy.  Poconos.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Amy.  I was just wondering if anybody ever noticed.  When Tyra speaks, doesn't it sound like she's like a guest speaker at a fucking preschool 
[02:22:30]  talking to a bunch of fucking six-year-olds?  She does because everybody is so far below her that they are children.  Yes.  Yes.  You got it.  My wife loves them shows, and I can't fucking stand it.  She's a dumb whore.  Both of them.  What are you going to say, Finn?  Once she starts coaching people through their little exercises, it really gets very condescending.  Oh, good.  Which we get to see here.  I love it.  They went to a styrofoam factory?  Well, it's factory.  Sorry, I forgot the guy there.  Because I saw a factor.  Tyra's formula is, you're afraid of something? 
[02:23:00]  Let's get the largest amount of that thing and put you near it or in it or on it or open  it.  It couldn't just be a couple of blocks of styrofoam and here, hold this here in the studio.  The whole ceiling has to collapse with styrofoam.  Yeah, we're taking it down on you.  Styrofoam factory, which you know just pumps out like house-sized blocks of styrofoam.  Gigantic blocks.  Just fill the room and just like, I was kind of a little frightened.  Now, we mummified her in styrofoam and beat her feet with a rock. 
[02:23:30]  Well, let's see what happens.  Let's hear.  Hi, I'm Susie Ramirez.  Welcome to Williams Home.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you, too.  You can just see how overwhelming it is for Arne to even be in the presence of styrofoam.  At first, Arne was having none of it.  No.  Arne. 
[02:24:00]  Arne.  Arne.  Arne.  Arne, too bad.  She ran away?  She ran away?  But after a few minutes with the doctor, she was finally ready to face her fear.  Actually touching the styrofoam is something she'd never done before.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Audio for running away.  She's in a styrofoam factory, so where's she going to run to? 
[02:24:30]  Let's go to Jeff in Florida.  Jeff?  It's got to be a safe place to work, though, huh?  Yeah.  Certainly.  A whole big, like, pallet fold falls on you and you all laugh.  And if you need to move the location, like, say you want to move, you don't even need to  pack up the factory.  Just send it as is.  Put an address on the front of it and ship it out.  Nothing gets damaged.  That's right.  I walk the line.  I walk the line.  Jeff?  Florida.  Yeah, I wonder...  Why don't you walk the line to a plastic surgeon and get that fixed? 
[02:25:00]  Why don't you have your face fixed?  Holy shit.  Marry me.  Marry me.  No?  All right.  I'll ask you on stage.  Because you're mine, I walk the line.  Marry me.  What?  Disappointed you didn't win the Oscar?  You fucking birth defect face?  You should do the fucking...  Do the head spin in front of the Viper Room.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  No, you've gone too far. 
[02:25:30]  I'll fuck him in the mouth then, he ass.  What do you think of them apples?  Jim Norton at Bananas in Poughkeepsie all weekend long.  Poughkeepsie.  Jeff in Florida.  Jeff?  Yeah, I wanted to ask Gobe if he has a phobia of marshmallows.  Actually, I didn't have a phobia of marshmallows.  I had a phobia of not fitting in.  Aww.  Hence the joining of a fraternity.  Oh.  Hey, I just want to let you guys know I love all you.  You're all funnier than shit on my...  Thanks. 
[02:26:00]  Another.  Because there might have been a butt coming after that, so cut him off at a good point.  I just want you to know, I love you.  Click.  Hey, because I didn't get to see the video, so did they dump the styrofoam on this broad, or...  Um, she...  She comes back in the studio, and then they put, uh...  I think, uh, Trek 6 is when she's presented with the challenge concerning styrofoam.  Very well put.  Also, what?  They just went to the factory to...  I was trying to read and talk.  Oh, wait, that clip, uh, uh, ends with her running away, so she didn't do anything in the 
[02:26:30]  styrofoam factory?  Yeah.  Okay.  Fans acting illiterate.  Yeah.  The next clip...  Wow, let me dance to the music in the car.  Uh-huh.  I would have killed for that.  Yeah, you would have killed yourself if you got it.  Good for you.  You're a comic, not a fucking commercial.  You're not a product hawker.  Yeah, you tell him.  Exactly.  I'm not a residual collector.  Right.  All right, well, checks.  Way to phrase it better.  Eh, who needs enough money to pay his bills every month?  Eh, you'll make the money.  He's funny.  Pulling down a fortune here, I'm sure.  Nah, he'll make the money.  He's fucking funny. 
[02:27:00]  He's good looking.  He's popular.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What are you an authority?  Yeah, sir.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, thanks for, uh, pardoning the pal talk room, by the way.  But anyway, yeah, I'm just calling to say, hey, I'm a real, I'm doing the dishes, real  big fan and all that, and I just, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Oh, Jesus, I can't feel my arm.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Ah, how was that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Dude, you had me.  Oh, wow.  I was looking for a phone to call someone.  Hey, Tyra, I love you.  All right, see you guys later.  Take care, man.  Thank God you're okay.  Thank God.  I might have to break out some of my acting chops today.  Spuds Buckley?  Oh.  Damn it.  I want to see Spuds.  Let me see.  That guy has some good Foley work.  I see.  Some good Foley work.  That guy on the phone.  That's all right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course. 
[02:28:00]  How'd you do that?  I'm so unmusical.  It's a little rhythm.  One, two, three.  One, two, three.  I have the Mabel King horse.  A little paradiddle.  Mabel King.  I just don't know how to do it.  If this was a horse, McCartney would marry it.  Oh, my knuckles hurt.  I hurt my knuckles.  I hope for mine.  And that fucking Reese Witherspoon was mediocre at best. 
[02:28:30]  I shouldn't marry you.  She should marry me.  I like how he does both parts.  Exactly.  You should have won the Oscar.  I certainly should have.  So I guess it's just them coming back into studio.  Tyra.  The fan has decided it's time to move back to the bit.  Well, I saw Hope was looking at the track.  I'm just trying to anticipate needs.  Way to go, little chin scar.  Can I please everyone?  I applaud.  I applaud that.  Very good.  Reining it in.  Certainly.  Let's go to this clip. 
[02:29:00]  It's called Tyra Makes It About Her.  Arne, when I saw you running away from the styrofoam,  I immediately thought back to my experience with the dolphins.  Of course you did.  How could you not?  Who didn't?  Holy.  You can say it a million times.  You're not going to get the reaction you want.  No one gives a shit about your dumps.  No one cares.  Fear of dolphins.  I immediately thought about my reaction.  If she was afraid of heights and she went skydiving, I'd go, wow, that's a pretty legit thing. 
[02:29:30]  But just shut up.  It's styrofoam.  It's a dolphin.  Reese Witherspoon, she should be on.  I had a fear of birth defects on mouths, and then I was forced to live with one for three months and kiss it on film.  Immediately thought back to my experience with the dolphins, because I got acclimated with the water, and then they were going to bring the dolphins in, and I did the same thing.  I ran.  What were you thinking when you were running? 
[02:30:00]  I just wanted to get away from it.  It was like mountains and mountains of styrofoam, like everywhere you looked.  And they were cutting it, so bits of it were on the floor, and it was under my feet, and it was...  And I understand the sound is something for you, too.  Yeah, it was really...  The sound of the styrofoam touching itself.  It felt like I was inside of a piece of styrofoam.  Really?  It really did.  You felt like it was all over you.  It was everywhere.  Everywhere I turned.  And it's not the styrofoam sound.  That was the creaking of the bed.  Bottom sore.  Bottom sore. 
[02:30:30]  Uncle's cup.  No, no.  Grandpa.  Grandpa?  Was it Grandpa?  Yes.  It was Uncle.  Uncle just peeked in and watched.  Uncle was lookout.  Mark from Boston saying you guys should help Voss with his phobia of being funny or his phobia of picking up a check.  I'll say picking up a check, but Voss is very funny.  Voss is very funny.  He's been very funny, especially lately on the program.  He's a good comment.  All right.  Now, what's this last clip?  This is where she confronts her fear of styrofoam.  Yeah, the Tyra Banks treatment.  Okay.  Great. 
[02:31:00]  Okay.  Just stand right here.  Now, this is made of styrofoam, but it's painted orange.  Okay?  Stand by me.  It's painted orange so that it doesn't look too much like styrofoam.  But inside of here is an 18-karat white gold diamond pendant necklace from the Roberto Coin Chento Diamond Collection.  And the cool thing is that the pendant necklace also has a ruby hidden on the back for good luck.  Productory.  All right.  So there are diamonds inside of here waiting for you.  A beautiful diamond pendant necklace.  And if you can open it and get to it, that's for you. 
[02:31:30]  If they really wanted to do it, they would have hid it in her grandfather's foreskin.  Really get to that fear?  Peel his skin back with your teeth and then take the ring off.  Fucking styrofoam.  Yuck.  Is that really curing the fear?  No.  No.  What is she doing?  Do you think after a while the people are going to catch on and know that if they say they have a fear of something, she's going to hide some jewelry in it? 
[02:32:00]  Exactly.  Like a fear of a ring ding or something.  You get a tasty treat, a ring, and off you go.  Oh, I have a fear of being blown in my Saturn and patting a girl's head and a wig coming off and me going, say!  Well, nowadays we've got to take this crap seriously.  That's amazing.  Why can't we just say you're just ridiculous?  Stop.  Styrofoam?  Stop.  Enough.  Garden gnome girls. 
[02:32:30]  How about throwing her into the ocean and only having styrofoam flotation devices there?  Yeah, like those awful life things you see at the pool.  The life preserver, yeah.  That gives you a rash at the pool, yeah.  You get that rash.  It makes their...  See how fast she overcomes her fear of styrofoam.  I'm with you, Anthony.  Who's the gnomes, Stan?  Are we talking about them?  Coming right up.  It's coming up.  Oh, we got them.  But first, Jeff in Ohio.  Jeff?  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, don't you have a fear of vacuum cleaners? 
[02:33:00]  It's not a fear, but it just gives me the old heebie-jeebies.  It gives off the willies.  The sound of a vacuum cleaner.  And it goes back to my mom vacuuming pretty much all day.  Really?  Pretty much all day.  Lift your feet.  Yeah.  But to this day, yeah, when I hear vacuums, it's true.  These guys have seen it.  Goosebumps right away.  The hair, like, as they say, standing up on the back of my neck.  Because people used to call up and unannounce. 
[02:33:30]  They would...  I will remember that next time.  They would give old me, like, a comment or something.  And then they'd turn on a vacuum cleaner in the background.  You can't use a vacuum cleaner if you call up here.  It would just bother old but upset him.  Yeah, don't do that.  We don't want old but upset.  You know, I think the phones in this show, it's overrated.  We're going to have no listener input by the end of this program.  That must be like, hey, how you doing? 
[02:34:00]  You demand a vacuum cleaner?  Oh, no, I can't think of a vacuum cleaner.  I demand a signal.  Dump out, dump out, dump out, dump out.  Pess got me.  Pess got me.  Shut up.  Hey, we didn't get the clip of her, like, conquering her fear of styrofoam.  That was, like, the setup.  It's kind of boring.  It's very good.  Okay.  Look at that.  That's it, then.  Making an editorial decision that was probably right.  Kind of boring.  Somewhere around here is making a decision.  Ben is.  Ben is fucking doing a highlight for it.  Highlight for it.  Highlighting something. 
[02:34:30]  And then scum highlighting.  He's made decisions.  All you see, from our view, is a bunch of desks and stuff.  A fucking creepy Amish bearded intern.  And then all you see is a giant skull with what could be a window behind it.  It's just a fucking head with an awful fucking hairdo.  And occasionally it will turn.  And you're waiting for Comet Shoemaker-Levy to smash into the side of it. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  Well, let's do the garden gnomes.  Fear of garden gnomes.  I'm scared of gnomes.  What is a gnome?  A gnome is a little mythical character.  You've seen them on the front lawns and on the Travelocity commercial.  A little chubby thing with a pointy hat known as the gnome hat.  And I don't know what they're supposed to represent. 
[02:35:30]  Aren't they supposed to, like, do things?  Like, each type of gnome represents something else.  Some kind of power or some kind of thing in your garden.  Oh, do you know, Kev?  Come on, you do know.  Kevin.  Yes, you do.  I know nothing about gnomes.  Come on.  I don't believe you.  You have to know something about gnomes, you geek.  You fucking do.  You probably LARPed as a gnome.  You LARPer.  You LARPer. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, fear of garden gnomes.  So, first track, according to Than, Tyra makes it about her.  Of course.  You said you can't even watch the Travelocity commercials.  Those are the commercials that have the little gnome on the commercial.  I can't.  I'm scared to death of them.  I'm just afraid they're going to crawl out of the TV.  Yeah.  And even talking about gnomes gets to you because I can tell that even right now talking about it.  Yeah?  Tell me why.  It's just, I think it's very nerve-wracking. 
[02:36:30]  I think I've been teased and tormented about it for a long time.  Because people think, oh, it's a gnome.  It's something to be, you know, make fun of.  Just like with me with dolphins, people make fun of that.  And it doesn't mean that it's not real.  You know, they think, oh, I can make fun of you and maybe you'll jump, you know, out of this fear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that was good acting right there by Tyra.  Yeah.  She became the person talking to the other girl, but not as Tyra.  It was good.  I thought it was a different person.  I wonder if this girl has a fear of mental illness as well. 
[02:37:00]  And the fear of taking Paxil and other medication that has obviously been prescribed for her.  If you're crying talking about gnomes, you should just have your fanny pinched.  Gnomes.  Does the world really need you?  No.  Again.  Dude, I swear to God, you need Will Sampson and a pillow.  Why didn't I say chief?  Why did I have to try to be fucking too smart and say Will Sampson?  But now that you said chief, we all know.  I know, but it would have been funny or just spoiled the joke.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  I know.  A brilliant film. 
[02:37:30]  It really was good.  It's pretty much something you can keep away from gnomes, right?  Yeah, no garden.  Who the fuck has a garden?  I mean, they're not going to wake up and be like the Burger King guy just sleeping next  to you.  Which I have a fear of.  I know.  We have a burger king.  Can we please find out where this lady lives and just, like, pile as many gnomes as possible  around her house?  Aren't you just a bunch of little green guys?  Here's the next clip.  Practical jokes, Stan.  I didn't see this part.  This is some of the jokes people play on her involving garden. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, sweet.  So what happens when you see a gnome?  I start shaking really bad and crying.  It's just terrifying.  And tell me about some of the practical jokes that people have played on you.  My sister, her and my brother, they would tell me that, oh, we heard the yard gnomes walking  around outside and then one morning put them in my bed.  My brother has put them in my shower one night.  And it's just my boyfriend chasing me through Walmart with them. 
[02:38:30]  Scumbag.  How do you not love the boyfriend?  Yard gnomes.  What a prick.  Yard gnomes.  Is that what your father called them?  Hey, Prozac from Whackbag wants to be part of the show today.  Prozac.  Yeah, you guys are a bunch of fucking hacks, man.  Come on.  You're a bunch of Howard wannabes, man.  Get off the fucking radio.  Come to Sirius.  That's where you belong.  And you're going to fucking bomb there, too, man. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, boy.  I'm just kidding.  Try acting.  Woo!  Try acting.  Try acting.  You were acting.  I was so angered by him.  I believed him.  Oh, I felt bad about our show.  Oh, what a big relief.  And he was acting.  Hey, let's go to Greg in D.C.  Greg.  Hey, guys.  I was trying to find out if your interns and other employees have a fear of positive reinforcement.  Wow. 
[02:39:30]  Very nice, Greg.  Let's go to Talon, the trucker.  Talon.  Hey, Anthony.  Don't you have a fear of boogers?  And is this the Tyra Banks show or the Zoolander show?  Because she's fucking stupid as hell.  Here's how...  Thank you.  Let me get that in.  Yes.  The Zoolander show didn't need a dash after it with an explanation.  All right, let's go back to the fear of garden gnomes. 
[02:40:00]  I'm scared, Opie.  The source, excuse me, of her fear.  Do you know why you're afraid of them?  I think it goes back to when I was younger, like five or six.  I wanted to be a big girl and hang out with my sister and her friends.  And they were watching the movie The Leprechauns, all those movies.  And it's about a leprechaun who kills people to get his gold back.  So that and the Billy Goat Scruff story.  Is that like Ace of Fable or something?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  The big bad troll lives under the bridge. 
[02:40:30]  And in the same year, we went to a haunted house and we had to cross a bridge.  And someone reached up and grabbed my foot.  And it made you think of the Billy Goat Scruff with the troll underneath that were getting the goats.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Stop watching scary movies.  Yeah.  Obviously, she's got a problem with the scary movies.  Moving on.  Tyra's dumb poem to explain the task. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  She has another task for her.  She tasks me.  She tasks me.  Presents it in the form of a cute limerick.  Hickory dickory dog.  No?  Or how about roses are small, violets are bigger.  I'd say, what?  What?  Well, I'm not a good poet. 
[02:41:30]  No.  How are you feeling right now knowing that you're probably going to encounter some gnomes right now?  I'm very scared and terrified.  I'm very scared and terrified.  Well, you're really brave today, okay?  And I want you to stand up because I have a little something here.  Cue rich posh.  And actually, I have a little clue first.  Let me make my little clue.  What's the pointy hat?  I'm a gnome who's short and stout.  And I promise I won't jump out.  So in the garden that I roam, find me.  I'm the Tyra gnome. 
[02:42:00]  We have a little garden that we set up here, okay?  And there's ten gnomes there, okay?  So what that limerick means is there are ten gnomes, and there's one that's a Tyra gnome.  One intern needed.  So there's one that has my logo.  You see this right here?  That's the logo.  And one of them has that underneath.  She has to find the gnome that says Tyra on it?  Couldn't it say somebody else, then?  No.  It had to say Tyra.  Why does your name have to be under the gnome's foot?  It's not the name of the prize she gets.  It's just Tyra.  Tyra. 
[02:42:30]  Tyra.  Where she gets a prize.  It's like a game show for neurotics.  We should take this bit.  You know we could have fun with this.  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  And laugh the entire time.  Now, there's ten uncles standing nude.  We have taped a necklace behind the testicles of one of them.  All right, well, here's Tyra.  She's, uh, what are you right here?  Tyra's a condescending ass in this clip. 
[02:43:00]  Step inside the garden.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Like a dog.  Okay, so now what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to lift him up  and see underneath which one has the Tyra logo.  The Tyra gnome.  You ready?  Yep, that's one.  I didn't have it.  She touched one.  She's going to try another one.  Yes. 
[02:43:30]  She got it.  She got it.  Is she teaching kindergarten?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you hear her?  Yay, finger painting.  Yay.  Don't eat the paste.  Point to your shoes.  What is the Tyra logo?  Is it a vagina with, like, a torso and legs under it?  It should be.  I thought that they would probably green light that. 
[02:44:00]  I'm sure someone presented it and they went, look, we just, we can't.  Can't go with that.  She has to lift the gnome feet.  We can't and you're fired.  Yes.  Look at this.  Fucking Eric's got the Tyra logo.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, the circle with Tyra in it.  Looks very much like the Blink logo.  The old Blink logo.  The old Blink.  That's very good.  A pink logo.  Tyra.  Hey, let's go to Owen from Ohio.  Owen!  Owen!  Owen!  Oh, I appreciate that.  Owen! 
[02:44:30]  I don't know about Professor Anthony's theories, but I'm on Paxil and all those kinds of antidepressant  medications, and these people can't use that.  They need, like, a fucking lobotomy or shot therapy or something.  Yeah, this isn't curing anything.  Thanks for the call.  That's that Paxil.  Let's go to Joe in Glendale.  Joe?  Hey, I'm embarrassed to say that I was actually in the audience, and my wife wanted to go  to the show.  She warms up her own audience. 
[02:45:00]  She warms up her own...  Usually they have a comic or something that gets the audience warmed up.  She warms up the audience.  You know how she warms them up?  Uh-oh.  Face your fear, Opie.  That's right.  Thanks for that.  Goodbye, Travis.  So...  All right.  Uh, wow.  Where were we?  There was a vacuum plane. 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  That's where we were.  Do you have goosebumps?  Eric, feel his arms.  That is the weirdest thing.  Anyway, uh...  Fear of garden gnomes.  That's right.  That's where we were.  I saw the guy went blank for, like, two seconds.  I had a pee.  Tyra...  The prize.  Yeah, Tyra explains what the prize is and works herself in there.  Clip is labeled the prize.  Tyra makes it about her.  All right.  Let me tell you, Miss Amanda, what you were going to get. 
[02:46:00]  Contiki Vacations is hooking you up with a nine-day trip to Southern Ireland.  So they're all going to be talking like this when you get there.  Tyra, do you have friends with anybody that you want to visit places like...  Hold on, can you pause that real quick?  That would have been funny, especially if it was a trip to Africa, and you said,  and they're all going to be talking like this.  That would have went through on network.  What?  That was Italian.  The African part of, uh...  No, no, no.  Italy?  If you...  No, they're all going to be talking like this.  Like this.  Well, you know.  I'm saying if you stereotype that.  Or, we're going to...  Look, we got you a trip to Israel, and they're all going to be talking like this. 
[02:46:30]  That's better.  Wow.  Why don't you say a trip to Nebraska and do Johnny Carson?  Oh.  That would have been like they gave away a trip to Nebraska, and they're all talking like this.  Oh, I love your Carson.  But do you see how that's acceptable?  And I know I'm preaching, but I don't care.  And that's fine.  But man, if a fucking white talk show host had said that, like you're going to, you know,  Nairobi, and, you know, they'll all be talking like that. 
[02:47:00]  Boy, that would have been fucking dumped in a second.  Fucking Hollywood stinks.  Sorry.  Speech!  Speech!  Day trip to Southern Ireland.  So they're all going to be talking like this when you get there.  And you...  By the way, let's point out the worst...  Is that a horrible...  The worst Irish accent ever.  That's good acting.  Yeah, way to prove you're a good actor.  Way to emphasize.  They're all going to be talking like this.  Like Swedish.  What is the accent she's trying to do?  I don't know. 
[02:47:30]  Get the fucking accent right, you fucking spook.  That's the accent in Ireland.  Why do they use the seawar?  They use that freely over there.  What?  That's right, though.  You fucking cunt.  Get me a Guinness, would you?  To Southern Ireland.  So they're all going to be talking like this when you get there.  And you and a friend...  They're all going to be talking like this.  Yeah, that was a Hindu accent.  Yeah, maybe.  Oh, we're going to Ireland.  That's where we all live. 
[02:48:00]  It's wonderful.  This is Tyra.  Fucking woman of a thousand voices.  None of them with talent.  Trip to Southern Ireland.  So they're all going to be talking like this when you get there.  And you and a friend...  Just for my service.  If you want to visit places like Dublin's Parnell Square and St. Stephen's Green, and you'll  be able to tour Cork and Blarney and Kilkenny and the lively sea town of Galway.  But I've never been to Ireland.  I haven't been there.  They're all drunk anyway. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, sorry.  That's okay.  I stepped on something.  Just drunk Irish Joe.  With Tyra.  Yeah.  Making it about herself.  But I've never been to Ireland.  Yes, I have once.  Modeling job.  They didn't pay me my money, but that's another story.  And Joy, they sure did.  Company went bankrupt.  Enjoy Ireland's medieval towns, castles, and cathedrals.  Do you know how gorgeous that is going to be?  Way to add, Tyra.  Yeah.  Apparently your modeling was not helpful.  They went belly up right after they photographed you. 
[02:49:00]  No kidding.  It is there who went belly up.  Yeah, you fucking asshole with a horse hair wig.  I cannot stomach her.  And that fucking Irish thing doesn't annoy me, but it's going to fucking irritate me.  It doesn't affect...  I fucking can't talk.  I'll just say it doesn't affect me, but it's going to remind me.  I've got to tell you, though.  You've had a terrific show, Jimmy.  I feel good about it.  You've really had a great show.  I don't mean to be preachy, but that's the type of shit that you've got to look for and  just watch.  Just watch what political correctness does.  Exactly.  Dece.  Yes, sir.  All right.  So I guess that's it for that one. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  She got her trip.  Did she?  Yeah.  Well, here's the one I saw.  Fear of Ovens.  To Ireland.  Fear of Ovens.  And the blonde was just shaking her ass off.  Couldn't get anywhere near an oven that was in the studio.  Yeah, well, you know what?  If she was married and she had a fucking husband who knew what he was doing, she'd have a fear  of black eyes and she'd learn to cook.  Well, how'd you get over your fear of Ovens?  Well, my fear of a boot in my spine was greater.  My fear of a slapped mouth was greater. 
[02:50:00]  Let's meet Ashley.  Of course, eight domestic violence jokes in a row.  I wonder why.  This is Ashley, and her phobia involves something that all of us have in our homes.  So Ashley, tell us what you're talking about.  Billions of dollars?  A fucking maid?  A vomitorium, you fucking dumb model?  I was bonding with her for a while.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  This is Ashley, and her phobia involves something that all of us have in our homes. 
[02:50:30]  So Ashley, tell us what your phobia is.  I'm deathly afraid of ovens.  Ovens.  Ovens.  Like ovens.  Ovens that you cook in.  Ovens you drive.  Toaster ovens, barbecue pits, ovens.  Anything that has to do with cooking something.  Yeah.  That's not even that crazy a fear.  That could be a claustrophobic.  Because if you think about an oven, I mean, there's rather unpleasant things that can happen  to you in an oven.  Or you might be scared it might blow up or something. 
[02:51:00]  Explosion.  Yeah.  You're in the oven.  You can't get out.  The heat's coming on.  You're like, I'm going to make me like a human food.  Would he hide in this stove?  Would I throw a lighted match in here?  So I say if Rocky was in this stove?  Oh, yeah.  It's a fear.  You watch that cartoon.  It was very scary as a child.  The voice reminded me of, I said, cook the hostage.  Cook the hostage.  What's up, Doc?  Never noticed that.  Laird sounds like Bugs Bunny. 
[02:51:30]  Yes, he does.  Source of fear.  Why do you think you're scared of ovens?  I'm not, like, really sure.  As long as I can remember, I've been scared of ovens.  But I do remember one thing in particular.  When I was, like, five, six years old, Nickelodeon had a show on Saturday night called Snick.  And one of the shows of Snick was Are You Afraid of the Dark?  Maybe people are familiar.  I know that show.  Yeah.  Well, one of the episodes was there was an oven in a basement. 
[02:52:00]  And kids got, like, locked in the basement.  And the oven came to life.  And it, like, it glowed orange.  And it made this sound.  And the kids got sucked in.  And they died.  Like, they never came out.  Ooh.  I'm scared.  Basically, these people just have trouble discerning fiction from reality.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some kind of fiction from their youth.  TV shows.  Movies.  It wasn't real.  Uh-oh.  What did I do?  Did I do that?  What happened?  Let's hope not for your future.  I know.  I don't know. 
[02:52:30]  Okay.  Thrill as she bakes.  They really do have a fucking awful inability to separate films from...  It's like being fucking terrified of the Hulk and that fucking awful hairdo.  So they bring in Eric Logan to help you.  You just have to touch his hairdo.  No!  I don't want to touch his hairdo.  And their oven... 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Because I guess they couldn't find an extension cord long enough.  They just have an oven sitting in the middle of the stage.  And they open it and there's just four sterno pots lit in there.  Are you shitting me?  They couldn't figure out...  How to have a live oven.  ...work out how to have a real oven.  Yeah.  So it's an oven with sterno in it.  Which doesn't really replicate what it's like to have an oven.  No.  The heat.  Yeah.  The ominous heat and glow of the oven.  The electricity.  Thirting through it.  Gas, perhaps.  Hissing.  It's a waste of time. 
[02:53:30]  Before it...  Very scary.  Not with four little fucking sterno things.  And it's warm, but it's not going to burn you.  I feel the heat, but it's not going to burn you.  Don't get scared when you get close and feel that warmth, okay?  It's not burning me.  You see that?  It's not burning me.  What's the use of it?  You can do it.  Slam her head.  Blow it open.  You can do it.  You can do it.  There you go!  Yes!  Yes!  Okay.  Now, in you go.  In you go.  In you go.  You have to be careful.  Oh, my God.  I don't want you to burn yourself. 
[02:54:00]  This is a hot oven.  There's a fire going on in there.  So you cannot go in and pull so fast that you can burn yourself.  Tyra Mengele.  Oh, yeah.  It's counting out your chest.  Okay.  Here we go.  But remember, when you put it in, don't pull so fast out that you burn yourself, okay?  Here we go.  Here we go.  There you go.  Push it in.  Push, push.  Push.  Push, push.  Yay!  Close it.  Close it.  Close it.  Close it.  Careful.  Don't burn yourself.  Go under.  Under.  Wow!  Yay! 
[02:54:30]  Remove your clothing and put them in a pile.  You will all be kept together when you get to the family camp.  I want to thank the FCC for taking away all our edgy programming.  You made the right choice.  Thank you.  Because this is what you're stuck with.  This is what we get now.  Four sternopots and a stove with a petrified lunatic in front of it.  You really know what the American people want.  Self-important psychopath directing her.  Thank you.  This is kindergarten shit.  And that's why they never plugged in, by the way, because you're afraid of her burning 
[02:55:00]  herself and having a lawsuit.  Ah, yeah, probably.  Well, now she, well, she retrieves the cookies.  That's what it was, cookies?  And she gets a prize for retrieving the cookies.  And not to nitpick, but four sternopots is not going to cook, you know, cookie dough properly.  Cookies.  No.  Like Coven would.  No.  No.  Maybe she should have a fear of uncooked cookies.  She will now.  Are you ready?  So first, bare hands open.  You can do it.  There you go.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes. 
[02:55:30]  Okay.  Here we go.  You can do it.  We want cookies, don't we, guys?  Yeah.  Get it out.  Yeah.  Put it on top of the stove.  Put it on top of the stove.  Put it on top of the stove.  Put it on top of the stove.  Okay.  Push it back in.  Push it back in.  Push it back in.  Now.  Push it.  And close.  Close it.  Yes.  That's enough.  That's enough.  Yes.  All right, Ashley.  Since you have hung up.  Come here.  Oh, we're so done.  It's over.  It's over. 
[02:56:00]  Do you think on the way out, audience members actually, like, it's like coming out of a blackout  and go, I don't remember.  Did we clap and cheer for a woman for taking cookies out of an oven?  We did.  I got a babysitter for this.  Walk out.  Yeah.  You walk out just like, what the?  Well, where do you want to eat before we take the train back to Long Island?  Who the, what the?  Oh, no.  It's a L.A. show, right?  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  What did she get for taking the cookies out of the oven? 
[02:56:30]  Hopefully diabetes.  Now we're going to numb this toe before we garden shear it off.  We all like stuffing styrofoam in our socks, don't we, guys?  Yeah.  She gets a trip to Miami because it's hot.  Get it?  All like an oven.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  Sure.  And then she actually gets cooking lessons, too, just to make sure she really gets burned.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  So there you go.  I can't get enough of her because she's so ridiculous.  You're right, dude.  She's horrendous.  And it's all about her.  And the show's getting good ratings.  She's on XM.  Is it getting good ratings for a show?  I personally don't get it at all.  I'll say it for the record.  She sucks.  And for the record.  Yes.  And might I add, with emphasis, this bitch sucks. 
[02:57:30]  Let's go to Bill in Tennessee.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Wait.  I'm sorry to interrupt, Bill.  Just hold your horses, fucko.  What were we doing yesterday that was making me laugh?  It was something.  Oh, shit.  It was so stupid.  And I wanted it to kind of continue.  Oh, we'll talk about it in the break.  Was it talking in our water bottles?  No, no, no, no.  Now I have a tube of toilet paper that I can talk through.  I'm Cave Boy. 
[02:58:00]  Help.  Help.  I'm Well Boy.  I'm stuck in the well.  Help me.  Bill.  Yeah, hey, guys.  Yeah, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, I was wondering if on that gnome segment, if you guys shot Bob Kelly, would be crying  through the whole thing.  We got to ask him.  Hang it.  Bob's on there, too.  He has a fear of the treadmill.  Fucking big job, guys.  All right, let's smack Bob's face at my dick.  Let's go to Eric in New Jersey. 
[02:58:30]  Eric.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Joaquin, good morning again.  Hey, listen.  It's a very popular phobia, that oven phobia.  Six million Jews had it.  Car crash?  Well, not even.  We did that joke very suddenly.  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  Very, very.  That was one of those jokes we did very carefully.  Yeah.  Like a surgeon.  We were very careful.  Precision.  Mm-hmm.  There's, yeah.  There's a way to address an awful subject because it's obvious, but when you just go six  million Jews were killed, it's like, eh.  Yeah.  Come on, fella. 
[02:59:00]  Frank in New York.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hi, Frank.  Thanks for the call before.  Love the book.  Wow.  Apparently, I have a fear of good punchlines.  I just want to point out the stickers for the Jimmy Show on Saturday.  Oh, good, man.  Thank you.  Bring some wow stickers.  That's Whip Mount Wednesday.  On Wednesday, if you've got a wow sticker, girls will show you their tits to drive away.  That's my explanation.  Or giving out wow stickers at the bananas on the show?  Well, you can buy them. 
[02:59:30]  Whip Mount Wednesday.  Are you bringing some wow stickers?  Yeah, well, you know, I asked for like a couple hundred, but they only gave me a hundred.  Of course they did.  I don't know why.  I don't know why either.  Can you bring up some wow stickers for us, Jimmy?  I will.  Yeah.  They should be giving out at all my shows.  Yeah.  Jimmy's at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  No, Poughkeepsie.  I mean, Poughkeepsie.  And we're doing the bigger room, so there's going to be, you know, hopefully close to  2,000 people for the weekend.  Wow.  Could you bring a box of wow stickers?  A hundred stickers they give us. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, bring a few stickers.  Okay.  Maybe a few shirts, if you would.  Yeah.  Sidecar Club Soda Candy could just throw them out as you're doing your thing.  What?  To the audience?  Throw them out while I'm on stage?  Yeah.  Okay.  I like that idea.  That's a little distracting.  I hope he said so.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Trying to get to a punchline, and there's this fucking 6'6 mustachioed ass throwing rolled  up shirts.  Get them while they're hot.  Exactly.  Ass.  Paul Dave Wonstad.  That fucking narrowing head of his. 
[03:00:30]  Fucking Kenny's head tapers.  He's almost a pinhead.  He really is.  Zippy.  He fucking has big feet, big man legs, wide, giant shoulders, little head.  Kenny, where's your head?  I don't know.  A witch doctor attacked me.  A witch doctor hurt me.  Fucking little teeny head.  Drew, are you ready?  Yes, I am.  I got a piece.  Yeah, Drew Boogie in the studio.  He's been doing great for us all morning long.  We'll go to break with some more Drew Boogie. 
[03:01:00]  I want to get busy.  I want to get busy.  Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy. 
[03:01:30]  I want to get busy.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Our duties do, do, do, do, do, fall.  Our duties do, do, do, do, fall.  Our duties do, do, do, do, do, have destructive power. 
[03:02:00]  You think it stinks now.  You should have seen it a month ago.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  If you battle me, I feel full of fire.  People always say my style is wild.  You got caught, you got caught.  That's me, I'm a rap on fire.  If you want to battle me, I'm going to eat tonight.  People from your ears, you take my style.  Don't walk, and tell my rhymes, I'll try.  Cast you off into exile.  Cast you off into exile.  Cast you off. 
[03:02:30]  Cast you off into exile.  Cast you off into exile.  Cast you off into exile.  Now.  Give it up for Drew Boogie, live in studio today.  Doing a great job for us.  Drew Boogie. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Careful with the clapping.  We don't want to sound like a morning zoo, where we clap for everything.  Why not?  We have our own style here.  That was kind of morning zoo-ish.  No, it wasn't.  We were applauding a fine work by a friend.  It was a genuine applause, as opposed to cover up the silence or a bad cornball moment.  How about we do the applause thing as we introduce our next guest?  Just to give it the morning zoo feel, all right?  This is the morning zoo.  Okay.  All right.  So, from Celebrity Fit Club.  You're not saying it right.  You're talking in your real voice.  No, I'm not doing the voice.  No.  You have to.  You have to. 
[03:03:30]  I don't want to.  It won't fit the clapping.  It's zoo-ish.  Come on, do it.  I just want to do the applause thing.  No.  Anthony's better at the morning zoo voice.  No, you've got to do the zoo voice.  Um.  Because that's more authentic.  I don't feel like doing the hacky radio voice today.  I don't want to play.  I don't want to do the hacky radio voice.  Jimmy, you do it.  Because you do a pretty good job with it as well.  Watch.  Jimmy's great at this.  All right.  Oh, it's the, uh, here's a Dr. Ian Smith.  But that's Johnny Carson. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, but it's good.  Anyway, uh, Dr. Ian Smith from Celebrity Fit Club.  Yeah, let's give it up for him.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And his, uh, his new book that we forgot to promote.  Trying to be a wacky zooey.  He, uh, he was at our St. Paddy's Day broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Yep.  And he had a lot of fun with us.  And then we realized as he was leaving that we never gave him one fucking plug.  Great bunch of guys we are.  The book is called The Fat Smash Diet. 
[03:04:30]  It includes over 50 easy and tasty recipes from Dr. Ian Smith.  And I hear this is working for a lot of people.  It's unbelievable.  I had this guy send me an email who lost 27 pounds in three weeks.  At first of all, I was like.  Robert Reed?  No.  No.  He lost weight for another reason.  But anyway.  Yeah.  If you like strawberries, just put them on the penis of your partner.  They're going to run at you from across the room.  Oh, God.  But I told this guy, I was like, dude, I mean, I'm happy you're losing so much weight, but  that's a lot of weight. 
[03:05:00]  You might want to slow down a little bit.  Yeah.  But no, people are losing weight.  And what's really cool, I did this on the website.  I put up testimonials so, like, people could say, like, what they're doing and stuff like  that.  And people are responding to it.  That is.  That's just as cool as looking at porno.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  I can see the connection.  Honestly, I've already read through the book.  What I like about this diet book, and actually, I'm looking more for, like, nutrition, nutritious  reasons.  It's a very easy read. 
[03:05:30]  Because some of these books are ridiculously complicated.  Like encyclopedias.  You can pretty much, you know, look at this thing in a day.  I can't read the book until I at least weigh as much as the book.  I'm working on it.  And you weigh about five pounds.  It's only, like, 150 pages.  That's it.  And there's a lot of big, big, big printing.  You know why, though?  I'm going to tell you why.  The celebrities, they were like, I gave them another book, and they were like, we love you,  Dr. Ian, but guess what?  It's too complicated.  So I was like, okay, I got it. 
[03:06:00]  For the next season, I'm going to make it nice and easy.  Thin, to the point, all the fat, pun intended, all the fat is cut out, and then boom, here  we have it.  Let me ask you a question.  This starts at 8 a.m., ends at 9 p.m. with a light snack.  What is your assumed wake-up and bedtimes?  Oh, I assume that if you're going to sleep, about 10 o'clock.  All right, so a light snack an hour before bed.  Yeah.  Like something, okay.  So that's, like, 4 in the morning for you.  What are you putting in your mouth at, like, 1 in the morning? 
[03:06:30]  And I mean food.  You haven't eaten lately?  I've been eating, and I haven't worked out in three days.  I feel like such a fatso.  He's not like Bruce Willis when he said that.  I've eaten pretzels lately, which I know of a lot of carbs, but pretzels.  No, no, no, no.  No, that's fine.  But at night?  Yeah.  Are you eating a bag of pretzels?  Um, no, not a bag.  My portions are pretty big.  Yeah.  He just sucks on one pretzel stick.  My portions are, um, just do anything to keep yourself from jerking off until your dick  hurts on Pal Talk. 
[03:07:00]  That's what my portions are.  He's a real guest.  He was just on the Today Show.  I happen to like Dr. Smith very much, but...  We want him to come around every once in a while.  He will come around, but I have to express it in...  He was just on with Matt Lauer.  A language.  What are you on with Matt Lauer?  Yes.  Cool.  And Kelly LeBrock.  Is that the new host?  No, no.  I know Ken, you are a parted.  Meredith Vieira is, but no.  Didn't Kelly look great?  I love her.  These guys didn't really agree with me, but she's still sexy, man, especially after she 
[03:07:30]  lost all that weight.  She lost, what, 30 pounds or something?  31 pounds on the diet.  31 pounds on the show.  Yeah.  She looks great.  She looks great again.  She didn't lose in her titties there, I see.  She was...  Very nice.  I got to tell you something.  And here's the funny thing about her, is that she had a tough time, right, after her  celebrity and tough marriage, blah, blah, blah.  But then she said she gained weight because she was tired of guys looking at her.  And I was like, interesting.  And let me tell you something.  When those pounds started coming off, that hemline got shorter, the cleavage got... 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, that's just an excuse, I think.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't want to get into her personal stuff, but she had a tough...  You just didn't buy it that she got fat because she was tired of guys looking at her.  There was other stuff going on.  There had to be.  There was other stuff.  Dr. Egan Smith had something he really wanted to do for Celebrity Fit Club, but they wouldn't  go for it.  Like, show her getting sexier and sexier with her outfit.  With her excuse...  With her saying, oh, I don't want men looking at me anymore.  And then each time...  I wanted to show like a montage of like, sexier, sexier, sexier, to the very end where 
[03:08:30]  she's like, you know.  Why wouldn't they do that?  Because I'm not a producer, and producers like to be in charge of everything, and no one else  has a good idea but a producer.  There you go.  You like that?  Excellent.  Okay, now I'm going to get fired from my show.  That's why this show works so great.  We don't have a producer.  Yeah.  Try to find him.  Good luck.  Did your producer highlight text for no reason and then put his face on a mirror?  We love Ben.  We're kidding.  And can we talk about what you were talking about before you came in here? 
[03:09:00]  How it's tough to not look at her boobs while you're doing the Today Show interview?  Yeah, this is Ian speaking.  A way to ask as you give it away.  Of course.  So he has to say it.  I like that.  That's what I do.  Of course.  Of course.  For my fans, this is Ian speaking, not Dr. Ian.  This is Ian the man speaking.  I just feel like, you know, it's interesting.  Like, you know, women are very attractive.  I love women.  You know, there's no secret.  Okay, I love beautiful and Kelly's beautiful.  But I always wonder, like, when you're looking, you're checking out a babe, right? 
[03:09:30]  Is she watching you watch her?  Like, does she know you looked at her?  And that worries me because then I'm like, ew, he's a pervert.  But I'm not.  But, like, you know, you have a low-cut dress on.  You look beautiful.  What am I supposed to do?  Look up at the sky at the birth?  I don't know what to do.  Well, you almost have an excuse, though, because of your line of work, you could be assessing her body and, you know, thinking about, you know, what she could do to help herself out or not.  Us, it's just pure, like, pervert. 
[03:10:00]  But what do the ladies expect if they're going to wear those dresses?  Like, the ladies got to call up and explain that.  We're supposed to look, right?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  And I'm not, like, you know, slobbering out of my mouth, but I'm appreciating you are beautiful, and I think that that's fair.  I mean, right?  I mean, don't call me a pig.  People can say, oh, Dr. Ian's a pig now, but it's not.  I'm a guy.  Can't you appreciate a beautiful painting?  Absolutely.  Or the cuteness of a puppy dog?  Sure.  Why can't you then look at a beautiful woman and just appreciate it without having all the other stuff thrown in like you want to bash her over the head with a cinder block and have sex with her and bury her in a shallow grave? 
[03:10:30]  Then again, I don't want to bury my face in a painting on the elevator.  I don't stand behind a painting on the train, pressing my erection on it, making the yummy noise.  That's the worst.  He's never coming back, Jimmy.  Do you understand this?  Well, I'm just saying things I don't do.  I happen to not do that stuff for that guy.  Good for you.  Can I tell you, though?  A friend of mine was on the train, a female friend, and that happened to her, actually. 
[03:11:00]  And I was like, I was mesmerized because, first of all, I couldn't believe that someone, a guy would do that.  First of all, like in a crowded train.  And I said to her, so what do you do in that kind of situation?  And she turned around and told him, and she did it loud to embarrass him.  If you don't get your so-and-so, I know the next time I can say stuff that I can't.  Yeah.  She said, if you don't get your so-and-so off me, I'm going to smack you across your face.  The way you should handle it.  The guy totally like coward.  Everyone in the train was looking at the guy.  They usually are cowards, those guys that would do stuff like that. 
[03:11:30]  Did you hear the story now about the guy?  I remember the guy that was photographed on that.  Yeah, the greatest subway per story ever.  Yeah, it's kind of an empty train, and this guy just sees a beautiful woman and just decides to start cranking.  Whips it out and starts jacking in the seat.  She pulls out her cell phone and goes click.  She pulls out the picture, puts it on the Internet, gives it to the police.  They find out who this guy is.  He's some kind of restaurateur.  What?  The picture is on the front page of the New York Post, I believe, a few months back. 
[03:12:00]  So, since then, he's lost the restaurants.  Like, no one wants to go down there and, you know, do that.  So, he's now claiming, this is what he's claiming, that she was very insensitive to put it on the Internet.  What?  That she perhaps would have been justified to give it to the police, but to put it on the Internet was something she should not have done because it kind of ruined him.  Was he suing her?  Probably will end up suing her.  He also said that she walked in on him. 
[03:12:30]  The train was empty.  He was jacking.  I'm in my own bathroom.  What are you doing?  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm jacking here.  And she walked into the car as he was jacking.  Do you know the beauty of somebody coming with a story?  I've never heard of a story with less merit than what I'm saying.  That jerk-off at the 9-11 conspiracy had a better story than this guy has about why he was jerking in the other way.  Well, she walked in on me.  I mean, I lived here on that train.  Hey, lady.  Hey. 
[03:13:00]  You're right.  Jerking off here.  Like Hamilton.  Didn't anybody fucking knock?  She was insensitive of putting on the Internet, huh?  Yeah.  That's like this weirdo from the Homeland Security.  Oh, yeah.  Like this guy.  Are you crazy?  What is going on with this country?  Yeah.  Like this pervert is sitting there with-  Thought it was a 14-year-old girl.  Yeah.  That he was talking to.  Talking to and describing-  But here's the thing I have in this story.  I mean, it's really sick to even think about it.  But what kind of guy who knows that he's being a pervert, who knows what's happening, he knows the stings, will give his full name and what he does for a living? 
[03:13:30]  He did that.  He said this is-  Can you look to your left?  What the-  You did that?  Jimmy Norton.  No, no, no, no.  Well, not to underage girls, but-  Oh, yeah, to a regular girl.  To anybody.  No, but we're talking about-  This guy's a Homeland Security high official.  He turns around and says, who I am, what I do-  Sent his picture.  Sent his picture.  With his, like, number, his official-  There's a thing on it.  Badge number, whatever he got.  To impress her.  Yeah, to impress her.  And it impressed the police on the other end because they scooped him right up. 
[03:14:00]  I love the fact that they're going after these predators.  They are smashing so many of these child porn people and these fucking vultures.  It's great.  You know what they got to do, though?  They got to do it one more step further.  They got to have tougher laws, like crazy laws.  Like, if you get caught doing this, it's mandatory 50 years.  Like, something crazy.  Wow.  Yeah, it's just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Can we get cut one break?  I know.  We all make mistakes.  Please.  Let's go to the phones.  We got Dr. Ian Smith in studio.  Andy in New Rochelle. 
[03:14:30]  Andy.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up, man?  So, I've been doing the diet, you know, following the book and everything.  The first nine days, the detox thing is, like, the hardest thing you could ever imagine.  You got to eat fruits and vegetables and, like, you're pretty much eating nothing, and you're  pretty much just shitting all day long.  That's about it.  He's right.  It's the flush.  You're right.  The flush.  It's the detox flush.  You're exactly right.  For 90 days.  Yeah, but I was a little disappointed because I only lost about five pounds in that first  nine days. 
[03:15:00]  Only five pounds in nine days?  You're upset at that?  Yeah, because usually I burn fat really quick when I try to diet.  But can I tell you something, though?  You're supposed to lose two pounds a week.  Okay.  You just said you lost five pounds in less than two weeks.  And he was disappointed.  And you're disappointed.  Well, I've lost 11 total in probably about two and a half weeks.  What's wrong with douche?  That's awesome.  I want you to send in your testimonial because that's exactly what I want to happen. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, by the way, let me just say to you, you're right.  The first nine days are tough, and it's meant to be tough because once you get past that  first nine days, you now have a total new respect for fish and chicken and meat.  That's the whole idea.  You detox and you flush it out of your system.  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't wait to start eating again.  It was amazing.  Like, to get past just the fruits and the vegetables, I was driving me nuts.  Well, I want to say congratulations, even though you kind of feel like you should have  lost 100 pounds in a week.  Well, because you know what it is?  I've done all these lousy diets like Atkins and all that crap, and I'm used to losing 
[03:16:00]  weight really fast.  And you used to gain it back.  But I gained it all back.  Yeah, you used to gain it.  Always gain it back.  Doesn't happen on this one, my friend.  All right.  All right, man.  I lost weight faster than Mabel King.  I'm the one who emailed you, Mike.  If I may use Mabel King again in one show.  Email me again.  All right.  Let's go to Momo.  Momo.  Hey, good morning, Doc.  I had a candy bar.  I lost 210 pounds in 45 minutes, or however long I was out for.  Hey, first of all, Opio, I just want to tell you I love you. 
[03:16:30]  I think you're a great guy.  Uh-oh.  That's suspect.  But anyway.  But.  And Jimmy, I love you.  There's a butt there, but.  Yeah, well, I think he wishes there was a butt there.  Yours.  Well, where's Pat been?  Thank you, Momo.  What do you got?  I want to ask Dr. Ian.  Dr. Ian, I have a condition.  I'm sure you're familiar with Celiac Spru, and is there anything, I don't know about your  diet, I've never read the book, I don't know anything about it, but do you have any tips?  Because I really do need, I'm a commercial driver, I'm one of those schleps to drive these 
[03:17:00]  trucks, and I do need to lose some weight.  So what would you recommend as far as that goes?  First of all, I always tell people who have medical conditions, the first thing you have  to do, and I'm just not trying to sell a book, this is for any diet you go on, whether it's  mine or someone else's, you've got to take the foods that are in the program to your doctor  and say, listen, what foods are going to trigger my illness and what won't trigger my illness,  first of all.  Right.  You see what I'm saying?  People go on these programs, they have medical conditions, and they're eating bad stuff  for them, and they get sick.  So, first thing you do is get the book, and you know what? 
[03:17:30]  Like I said, I'm not trying to sell you a book.  Take the book, take it back if you don't want it, but get the book, take it to your doctor  and say, listen, circle or write down the foods that I can eat on this.  The great thing about my program is you can eat tons of different foods and you can have  substitutions.  So this will work for you.  I've actually had people who have this illness who've emailed me.  This will work for you, but you have to choose what food you want to eat on the program.  Right.  Does that make sense?  Yeah, it does make sense.  I've got one quick question.  Jimmy, do you have any idea if you're ever going to come and do a show in Memphis? 
[03:18:00]  I'll get down there eventually.  There's other places like Oklahoma, Minnesota, Seattle that I want to hit first where I've  gotten a lot of email, Portland, Oregon, but I will eventually get down there because  I think XM has a thing down in Tennessee, right?  There is a funny bone down here.  I've been dying now to come down here.  Nashville, Nashville.  Oh, that's right.  Love to have you, man.  All right, guys.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Very good.  Let's see.  Yeah, we've got a lot of truckers calling, Dr. Ian Smith.  This is Troy in South Carolina.  Troy?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I'm not a trucker. 
[03:18:30]  I'm on the road salesman.  I'm 800, 1200 miles a week.  I'm driving around, eating out with customers a lot.  I find myself hitting the drive-thrus and whatnot.  I'd like to lose weight.  I'd like to eat better.  How can I go about making better choices?  You know, is there something I can do?  I don't have a kitchen to go to every day.  I don't have a place to pack a lunch and have that.  What can I do when I'm forced to do it commercially, I guess, eat commercially?  See, I get this question all the time, and let me explain something to you.  The whole purpose of the diet is I give you a long list of foods that you could find in 
[03:19:00]  the middle of freaking Little Butt, Arkansas.  I mean, you know, if you go into a restaurant and you have my book with you, it's very small.  Like Opie said, you can fit it in anything.  You go in there and say, okay, listen, what can I have?  There's tons of stuff on the menu you can have.  It's just an issue of ordering what you can eat off the diet.  And the second...  Go ahead.  As far as the drive-thru, though, are there any better restaurants to, you know, if I'm  hitting, you know, a drive-thru, I mean, is that going to address some of those things 
[03:19:30]  as well?  Absolutely.  I mean, of course, if you go to Fat Burgers Drive-Thru, which I love in L.A., that's not  going to help you.  But if you go to, I don't know, these restaurants that have all these different burgers.  Denny's is like a common one that's open late.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, egg whites.  Yeah, yeah.  But you know what the biggest problem is when you eat out is you know what's healthy on  the menu, but you see all the choices of all that stuff where you're like, ah, I love all  this.  It's so hard in your mind to go, well, all right, I'll blow off what I really want to  eat because I'm trying to eat healthy. 
[03:20:00]  You know, you're so tempted by the menu.  Listen, if I could bottle up discipline and motivation and sell it to you guys...  That's the biggest challenge, though, you know?  Trump would...  I'd be Trump's daddy.  Just getting your mind right.  I'll have to go pick up the book.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Have a good day.  I'm trying to work out because my foot hurts, so I can't do certain like ellipses or anything.  Like even something that's hard because of the motion of my ankle.  I have an Achilles problem.  So I do a lot of bike, which helps.  And then light weights.  And I started doing the stupid, those little faggoty balls, those big rubber balls.  Those things are the...  I've started doing like sit-ups on those things. 
[03:20:30]  And I, honest to God, thought I was going to shit in the gym while I was doing it.  Those things...  I've never felt any type of an abdomen workout.  Yeah.  And went back, too.  Like it's like that stuff was really good.  And I haven't done...  Obviously.  What?  Never felt any type of abdomen workout.  I know.  I really am saying that.  Like I'm built like Bruce Lee.  You're all supposed to go, get out of here, yo.  My wife does those things.  I used to look at those things like, what are these people doing?  Like the trainers?  Like what are they doing with the stupid balls?  And then I tried it because I was helping some people. 
[03:21:00]  I was like, whoa.  Like there are certain muscles you can get with that that you don't get like lying straight  on the floor or whatever.  I can feel a teeny bit of a chest muscle, too.  I've been feeling...  Wait.  Not much.  Not much.  It's a teeny bit.  A teeny bit.  But it's there.  He's motivated, though.  He's lost a lot of weight.  He really has.  Last few days I've been lazy.  But yeah, I've been going to the gym a lot.  How much did you lose?  I don't...  Weight-wise, I don't think a lot of actual pounds.  I'm just trying to tone up.  You're transforming.  No, you've lost a lot of weight. 
[03:21:30]  You think so?  I don't know.  It's very obvious.  I don't...  Because I'll weigh myself and I'm like...  From the HBO show you did to now?  I was a monster then.  Like fat pig with an open shirt.  You know how hard I was to find promo shots?  Everyone at HBO sent me for the DVDs coming out.  Everyone they sent me my neck.  My double fat neck.  Oh, I was just sick in every picture.  I'm like, no, no, no. 
[03:22:00]  How did it look?  It was a smiling.  Big fucking retard face smile.  Happy.  Like John Panette.  I love this guy.  This guy's something wrong.  He's going to be on Lucky Louie in June there, Dr. Ian Smith.  The show is not out yet.  On HBO, yeah.  Oh, cool, cool, cool.  Right after Entourage.  Whoa.  You blowing up, man.  I hope so.  We're going to lose him soon.  You're not.  Please, you're not.  He just is in denial still.  I'm going nowhere.  Let's go to Brian in Jersey. 
[03:22:30]  Brian?  Yeah, gentlemen.  How are you?  Good, Brian.  Thanks for the call.  I got a question for Dr. Ian Smith.  I'm an ex-college football player.  I've lost over 100 pounds.  I was 320 pounds up to a size 48 waist.  I'm down to a 38, and basically I'm at this plateau at 220 where no matter what the hell  I do, no matter how healthy I eat, no matter how much I work out, I'm not losing another  pound.  What's the next step to go into losing more weight?  I want to get down to like 180 so I can actually be in good shape for the next 30, 40 years 
[03:23:00]  if that ever fucking happens.  Okay, hold on.  Can I just first tell you, to lose 108 pounds, you said?  100 pounds, yeah.  First of all, that's tremendous.  I mean, come on, dude.  People are so hard on themselves.  First of all, acknowledge that that's a great job.  Oh, no, it totally is.  It totally is, but I'm still out of shape, you know, like physically.  When I go and run, I still get winded real easily, obviously a lot more than I was when  I was playing football all the time.  Okay, here's the deal, my man.  You hit a plateau because your body is happy with all the weight that you've lost. 
[03:23:30]  That's normal.  Your body is saying, listen, I lost a lot of weight.  Leave me alone.  So you've got to kick it up.  And I have a chapter that's called Busting the Plateau.  And the idea is we're going to drop your calories a little bit.  We're going to kick up your burn on the other side, and that will kick it off.  My nine-day detox will get you running.  Trust me.  It will get you going.  But, you know, I mean, you've got to be patient, though, my man.  It's not going to happen in two days.  Oh, it's been over three years.  It's been a three-year process.  This hasn't been like quickly.  I've been doing this very slowly over three years, but I've been at this plateau now for about 
[03:24:00]  nine months.  Here's the deal.  You get the book and read my chapter on how to break through the plateau.  If it does not work, you email me, and I will send you a refund for the book.  I'm that confident in it.  Cool, man.  All right?  Much appreciated.  All right, man.  Yeah, the book's called The Fat Smash Diet by Dr. Ian.  I'm going to try this because, again, I had a plateau, too.  It's funny you said that because that's where I feel like I'm not.  Maybe that's my problem.  Like, I'm kind of teetering around this one, and I don't care what I weigh.  I don't care what the scale says.  I'm just like...  You just want to look good, right?  I just want to be spelt and gentle. 
[03:24:30]  For the ladies.  Yeah.  I want to just do the bike for a half hour every three days and then look like Dr. Ian  Smith in two months.  Good luck.  I'm very unrealistic.  Good luck to you.  Can I tell you guys who's on season four?  No.  Am I allowed to say that?  No.  Ooh.  Yes.  I want to know.  I would love to know.  You know, really?  Yeah.  Celebrity Fit Club season four.  I was on the phone with Big Pussy yesterday.  Vinny Pastor.  Really?  The Sopranos.  Very cool.  And he's going to be on...  What is he weighing in these days about?  270, he says.  270?  The whole cast got huge, though.  You've seen Gandolfini's a monster. 
[03:25:00]  Except for that one guy, Joe, who was on...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We had him on about a week ago.  Yeah, he's still limpy, but he looks good.  Two weeks, whatever.  So he's on, and guess...  I didn't know this lady.  Her name is Erica Alaniac from Baywatch.  She's one of the Baywatch babes, right?  So I didn't recognize the names.  I went on the internet, and I was like, holy cow.  She is a babe.  She was a babe.  And I'm like, how did she weigh?  How much does she weigh now?  They haven't told me to weigh yet.  Oh.  That is the key, though.  Get her now, start banging her, and then just keep her self-esteem low so when she looks 
[03:25:30]  good again, she still feels like a fatso, and you can climb on whenever you want.  That's my key.  That's the Jim Norton horse smash diet.  I'll tell you someday.  We start taping in L.A. in two weeks.  I'll let her know what Jim Norton's doing.  Oh, man.  And our dream is to see an anorexic model on the show.  Where you just browbeat her because she's only lost two pounds.  What's wrong with you, fatty?  Yeah, exactly.  I ate a pee today. 
[03:26:00]  Well, what else did you indulge in?  Right.  I can only see three ribs.  Oh, my God.  That was horrible.  Well, you guys kind of did it, though, with Gunner.  Let's be honest.  The guy, I mean, we've argued about this, but when I think Celebrity Fit Club, I want to  see fatties right off the bat.  Yeah, but I'm going to stick my grounds, Opie.  I don't care how much I like you.  Used to be.  Yes.  Let's see.  Oh, my God.  That one happened. 
[03:26:30]  Are you kidding me?  She's unbelievable.  She's naked.  You know what?  Now you ruined it because I can't watch the show.  No.  Because if I see her in any other light but that, it's ruined.  Well, you could see her hair in a shot in the dark video.  She looks like Ozzy.  It's Ozzy's hair.  She was in all those movies.  Wow.  She was in the movie with a bunch of movies.  Dude, she was like the.  She was the one that jumped out of the cake, right, in that movie with, was it Steven Seagal  or something?  She was the hot babe for like 10 minutes back in the 80s.  Give her 15 minutes.  She was everywhere.  Give her 15 minutes. 
[03:27:00]  All right.  15 minutes.  And then she was the first one that went out with Scott Baio, I think.  Did she?  I believe.  Steven Seagal put some weight on, too.  I met him once in L.A. just out of luck, and he's like a awesome weight.  Turn that back around, and I shoot you.  So she's on the show.  She's on the show.  How much you think, what would you guess?  How much she weighs?  Yeah.  She's probably 30 pounds overweight, at least.  Really?  Yeah.  Yes.  Wow.  All right.  You were saying, with the Gunner thing.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here's the thing.  I'm going to stick my ground. 
[03:27:30]  Most people, believe it or not, even though America is way overweight, most people only have  about 15 to 20 pounds to lose.  And even though Gunner wasn't very much overweight, Gunner was like, you know, these rock star  guys.  Because I told him, I said, Gunner, dude, you're two pounds overweight.  What can I do for you?  I was upset in the beginning.  But then he was like, but you don't know how I was back in the 80s.  And he wanted to be like ripped and tight, like you.  Anthony, you wanted to be ripped and tight.  Well, yeah.  Well, no.  That's just a tight sweater.  Buy a medium sweater, wet it, dry it for four days, and then put it on where your body 
[03:28:00]  is just forced out through your asshole.  That's the Anthony's sweater diet.  It's really just a sweater.  This sweater is getting burned tonight.  I am burning this sweater.  It'll go up like one match.  Gun.  Oh, gosh.  You guys are awesome.  From the today's show to you guys, this is great.  I love this.  Please come back. 
[03:28:30]  Because we do like you.  Yeah, this is real.  I'm going to try this thing already.  I hit a plateau.  That was exactly the word, what he said.  We got like two minutes left, and then we're going to go right to Drew Boogie to end the  show.  So, to finish up with Gunner, did you finish up?  I don't even know now.  Yeah.  I mean, Gunner lost 19 freaking pounds.  I mean, he looks awesome now.  And he wanted to get more fit.  It wasn't so much about losing a lot of weight.  But as a viewer, it's a lot more fun to see really big, overweight celebrities.  Yeah, that's what people want to see.  You know, big fat celebrities.  Who else is on the Celebrity Fit Club 4?  Oh, we got Nick Turturro, John Turturro's brother. 
[03:29:00]  We got Carney Wilson, who's coming.  She's the one.  I know.  She had the gastric bypass.  Yeah.  She had the kid, and then she didn't wait after the kid.  We got the rapper Bone Crusher.  You have to have that rapper.  You have to have that rapper every season.  And then we got the last one is going to be Angie Stone, who is a big R&B singer.  It's going to be good.  It's something for everybody.  Can I plug these books real quick?  Of course.  Dr. Smith's book, The Fat Smash Diet, definitely good.  Hold on, hold on.  Before you say that.  Oh, are both books on?  Okay, sorry.  Do what you got to do.  And Frank Vincent, A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man, one of my favorite actors. 
[03:29:30]  And of course, I'm at Bananas, and my tickets for The Orpheum with David Tell went on sale today.  And tomorrow, we go on sale for May 13th at the Borgata Event Center.  Me and David Tell.  Where's Bananas?  Bananas.  Poughkeepsie.  Tonight, Friday.  Tomorrow, Saturday.  And the link for the books are up on our website.  Yes.  I've checked out the Fat Smash Diet book.  It's excellent.  There's something in there for everybody.  I'm going to start Monday.  I don't need to follow the program, but I'm getting some really good little tips and some 
[03:30:00]  nice recipes for healthy eating.  You don't need to follow the program.  You ever see the body on him?  I'm just saying.  He's in good shape.  I've been beyond good shape.  He's in the type of shape when he walks in and just goes, Jesus, I wish I was a girl.  You're a mess, Jimmy.  Jimmy had a killer show today, man.  I love you guys.  Dr. Ian Smith, thank you so much.  Good being here, guys.  Always a pleasure.  And Drew Boogie, what can I say?  You rocked today.  Fucking great, man.  And we're going to go out with some Drew Boogie.  You guys have a great weekend.  Have a great time.  I've been busy.  Good kitty, Jimmy.  Thanks.  And I'll make sure I...

[03:31:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, hey, party rock. 
[03:31:30]  That's it. Party is over.  Everybody go home.  Speak for being in the show. </pre>
