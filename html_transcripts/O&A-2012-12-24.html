<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment focused on their “Super Bowl” listener challenge involving insects.  Ken, a New Jersey insect seller, brought various creatures including hissing cockroaches, mealworms, superworms, honeybees, German roaches, and flightless fruit flies to the studio. He discussed their uses and behaviors, culminating in him being stung ten times by the honeybees despite an allergy, triggered by the hosts' insistence on someone blowing into a phallic-shaped contraption to agitate them for the challenge.  A phone company worker then arrived with paper wasps, further highlighting the challenge's dangerous nature. Extensive discussion ensued regarding the challenge's safety and setup, including modifications by Intern Bill, prompting the arrival of EMTs who shared anecdotes from past stunts. Callers added jokes and reminisced about past show antics.  The segment concluded with preparations for the challenge, EMTs on standby, and contestants filling out extensive paperwork, alongside tangential conversations about the hosts' job security and an upcoming holiday show.  Numerous off-color jokes and sexually suggestive remarks were made throughout.


The show then transitioned to preparations for their testicular abuse "Super Bowl," with comedian Tracy Morgan as a guest.  They discussed a long-delayed stunt involving "beasting" a ball bag, originally promised with an Aztec prize that never materialized.  Contestants were still completing waivers and videotaped statements.  The hosts and Tracy Morgan donned bee suits, prompting much joking about their appearance and functionality.  Contestants brought various items for the challenge; some, like vice grips, glue traps, and a staple gun, were rejected, while others, including mousetraps, wax strips, and Bengay, were accepted. The rules were discussed, culminating in the "ultimate challenge": having bees released into a contraption placed against the testicles.  A significant portion focused on the logistical nightmare of safely introducing the bees, fueled by nervous humor and the fear of bee escapes and stings, particularly to those with allergies. The accidental breaking of a jar of bees added to the chaos. The segment concluded with Tracy Morgan suited up and the anticipation of the main event.


The “Super Bowl Thursday” competition commenced with three contestants: Raphael, Steve, and Matt, along with Tracy Morgan (who later left). The first challenge involved snapping mousetraps onto their scrotums; Raphael started strong with three, followed by Steve’s five (one fell off), and Matt's record-breaking six.  The next challenge, applying and ripping off wax strips, proved less successful and more painful. Actress Ari Graynor joined the commentary.  The final challenge, placing their scrotums in containers of live bees, ensued. Numerous obscenities and explicit descriptions accompanied the challenges, with frequent reminders to viewers not to replicate the stunts.  Fez Whatley from the Ron and Fez show made a brief cameo. The entire segment was broadcast live online.


The next segment depicted the bee-testicle challenge in detail.  The hosts adjusted the webcam for optimal genital viewing, noting the contestants' scrotums were sticky from the wax strips.  Raphael’s anxiety was apparent, and difficulty inserting testicles into the apparatus led to much ribbing. Raphael and another contestant, Matt, were stung multiple times. The apparatus broke, leading to discussions about handling the bees and wasps.  The segment concluded with multiple contestants experiencing bee and wasp stings to their testicles.  The show transitioned to listener calls, discussion of Uncle Paul's offensive comedic routines, commercials, and a “worst of” Opie and Anthony segment featuring an eggnog drinking contest.


This eggnog drinking contest featured nine contestants, including guests Ellis (post-stomach surgery) and Doug (who flew in from Arizona).  The rules: vomiting or urinating (in pants or leaving the room) resulted in disqualification. The prize was a MiFi device.  Contestants employed various strategies.  One contestant was penalized for drinking two glasses at once.  As the rounds progressed (up to round 34, then jumping to the end), contestants showed distress, vomiting or dropping out. Trash-talking and banter were frequent. Steve was disqualified for missing a round. Jimmy Norton hit his head. The eggnog supply ran low, requiring a refill.  Pat ultimately won, consuming at least 46 double shots, with John in second place.  The segment included shameless product plugs and promotions for upcoming show content.


The final segment focused on Pat's eggnog victory, with Martini Steve calculating the caloric intake. The hosts counted Pat's double shots past 50, 60, 62, 63, and beyond, with crude remarks.  Pat’s increasingly uncomfortable state was described with expressions like “gurgle” and “cracking.”  He eventually reached 70 double shots before vomiting over 4.3 gallons of eggnog (approximately 12,000 calories), prompting reactions of amusement and disgust. Even studio guest Eric vomited from the smell.  Listener calls and commercials interspersed the segment, culminating in a Hip Hop Abs infomercial clip, punctuated by inappropriate comments from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I don't know how he has so many creepy bugs.  I'll tell you why he's a creepy bug guy, because he has a lot of really creepy bugs that I've never seen in my life.  He decided to just bring in an array of bugs.  Here he is.  Big collection.  This is the guy that is saving Super Bowl so he can do the ultimate challenge.  What's your name, bro?  Ken.  Hey, Ken.  Nice to have you here today.  Nice to meet you guys.  Well, you want to bring some of your bugs in?  Sure.  We can have a little show and tell.  Yeah.  Where are you from?  New Jersey.  Why did I know that before you said it? 
[00:00:30]  Creepy bug guy has to be from New Jersey.  And we can collect this stuff from most of the buildings in New Jersey.  I don't doubt that.  Yuck.  Wait, like, this is your job to...  What is your job?  Yeah, what's your job that you have these bugs?  We sell feeder insects nationwide to pet stores.  Oh, okay.  Sure.  Bait shops, that kind of thing.  So the mealworms over there would be for your reptile, your lizards, things like that.  These are the bigger ones, the bigger, larger mealworms are for bait. 
[00:01:00]  And what about the cockroaches?  Why would people need these?  I see them all the time on this show.  For some reason, they're a staple of this program.  What would people need one of those for, aside from a radio show?  Just to feed reptiles.  Sometimes they keep them as pets.  Are those the hissing cockroaches?  Yeah, I have some hissers there if you're touching the hiss.  Matagascar.  You've got to hear these things.  You know what?  I'm proud to say we introduced the world to the hissing cockroach.  Oh, yes.  Way before...  National Geographic. 
[00:01:30]  Way before Fear Factor.  Yeah, true.  We were doing...  55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah, we were doing things with the hissing cockroaches many, many years ago.  You've got to bring one of those to the mic because this is the creepiest sound.  And they're...  Listen to this.  Ah, E-Rock's running.  Well, listen to what this thing will do when you touch it.  Oh, God. 
[00:02:00]  Right now it's burrowing into my hand, too.  I see that.  That hissing noise.  Can you find those in New York?  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  Can you find those in buildings?  Like, I see...  No, no.  In my apartment, I see a cockroach every once in a while, but I'll never see a hissing cockroach,  right?  Aren't they from Madagascar?  Yeah, these are actually from Madagascar.  They're just indigenous to tropical regions.  Yeah.  We're not allowed to sell these in Florida because they can live down there.  If these were to get loose here, they'd only be able to live during the summer and they'd  die as soon as the temperature went down. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  Like the homeless.  Like just...  Yeah.  The homeless in France.  Yeah.  Oh, but somewhere in Florida, you let those go and, uh-oh, could be a problem.  Yeah.  Two of them get together, hook up.  Well, we got to have a little sex.  The males have bumps on their heads and the females don't, so that's how you can tell them  apart.  Oh, that's how you can tell?  And the males hiss.  The females don't.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's kind of opposite of, uh, humans.  Exactly.  Where the male keeps quiet and the woman is just, you know, yap, yap, yap.  Yeah.  Hiss, hiss, hiss. 
[00:03:00]  And if she does, she usually ends up with bumps on her head.  Well, I got the list of insects in front of me here.  The hissing roaches, maggots, superworm beetles.  Yeah.  What's that?  These are the superworm beetles.  If you touch them, they'll release a pheromone, which is an attractant, like a sexual attractant,  which is something that females also do.  Are females.  Yeah.  But they have, uh, they, they also secrete a brown liquid that'll stain your hands, but 
[00:03:30]  they stink.  So does Jimmy Norton, coincidentally enough, when, uh, when he's out on dates.  Is that right?  Yeah.  This, these, uh, they, they, they, they smell too, but these will also do like a little,  uh, tickle, nibble kind of thing.  Not that I've tried it, but if you, if you were to, you know, place your stuff in there,  you would.  Your bag on top of that.  You'd get a sensation.  Now, none of these are poisonous.  Except maybe the honeybees.  The bees, the bees, the bee venom. 
[00:04:00]  Uh, there they are.  Yeah.  The bees.  Now, I saw your contraption, which is very phallic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Once these, once they place their, their bag, I guess, in that contraption, that appendage  that sticks out.  Yeah.  It should be blown into.  Uh, the reason for that is that it'll, the warm air will get these guys angry.  Oh.  So, someone has to blow into the phallic.  Phallic appendage.  Yeah, to the tip of that. 
[00:04:30]  As, as some guy's sack is hanging in the Tupperware portion.  You know, I've been fighting this for so long, I give up.  This show is gay.  What a gay show we're on.  This is a gay show.  So, you're telling me, as the expert, that someone has to blow into the tube to get these  bees going.  Someone does, and I'm, I'm not expert enough to do that myself.  What is it about, uh, human breath that, um, riles up the bees?  I, I don't know if it's the, just the heat and the moisture or the, something, you know, 
[00:05:00]  instinctive in them that just sets them off.  They start to start to attack.  E-Rock can't do it because it will be a bee holocaust.  It'll be like the showers at Dachau.  Now, if they're, I, I got stung by, by these bees.  I got stung about 10 times just collecting them.  This is how, wait, you got stung 10 times yesterday?  This is how dedicated this guy is to the show.  I love this show.  He's the one that stepped up and said, all right, I'll get the bees for the guys.  Look at his hand.  It's all swollen.  I got my hand and my arms.  He got stung 10 times.  He's allergic to bees.  And this is not fat.  It's a swollen bee venom in my. 
[00:05:30]  Are you kidding?  No, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'm fat.  I don't know.  What, uh.  I know.  I'm like, wow, that stuff must collect in the liver.  Or what, uh, what do you do to collect them?  I just, I just went in and I just stuck a stick in, got them angry when they came out.  I brushed them into cups and they just went all over me and started stinging.  So you got what, what, one of those big box type hive things?  Yeah.  The hives you were talking about.  Yeah.  I'm one of those guys.  How many?  Uh, I have three hives.  And what is it for?  Just honey or?  Just to pollinate. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And for honey, uh, make wine out of the honey.  Mead.  Really?  Mead.  Ah, yes, yes.  Yeah, that's a good old fashioned way to get drunk.  From ye days of old.  How many times did you get stung a year?  Having bees?  Nah, just a couple.  But, uh, last, last, uh, last summer I had some go up in my shorts.  Which is how I know these will work.  And I got stung.  And I, I have, uh, my daughters were out there and they're little and they just saw the bees  going up.  They saw me fall over on the ground screaming and, and, uh.  That's gotta horrify the children.  Oh, they were laughing?  They were laughing at me while I. 
[00:06:30]  That's great kids.  Jesus Christ.  I thought that that was done.  I was it.  No more kids.  All right, hold on.  Ben's raw, uh, Ben's raw ass has something.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Hey, I want to know if this dude brought his, uh, cock licking ball roaches.  What, what's, what's, what's that?  Cock licking ball roaches.  That's from what I cite my call.  Are you doing a callback of his awful, uh, line yesterday?  Yeah, I'm the awful calling guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Ben's raw ass, everyone.  All right.  Uh, what else is there? 
[00:07:00]  Anything of interest?  Um, just, these are just regular German roaches.  We have, we also have some flightless fruit flies.  We, we've bred these so that they wouldn't have wings.  So if you look at them, they kind of look like ants, but they're actually fruit flies.  Okay.  And what the hell can they possibly do?  They just, they just exist and people feed them to frogs.  Oh yeah.  That kind of thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you sell these to pet shops?  Pet shops, bait stores, and then regular just reptile enthusiasts.  Now obviously you've brought a lot of this stuff in just for show, but can we use anything 
[00:07:30]  else there on the table except for the bees?  Yeah, yeah.  I think like these are super worms.  You know, these are the other things that you see them eating on, uh, like Fear Factor  and that kind of thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they, and they stink.  They'll also nibble and stuff, but they're getting a little, uh, lethargic here.  A little tired.  Is it the cold?  Yeah.  Oh, and just so you guys know too, when you're ready for mosquitoes, let me know.  Just give me a week's notice and I can hatch you out a bunch of mosquitoes.  See, we wanted, uh, we thought about that way too late.  We wanted to do the mosquitoes as well.  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Cause, uh, mosquito bites on your bag.  I've never, thank God I've never been bitten on the bag.  I would say the mosquito, uh, bite on the bag would be worse than getting stung by a bee  on the bag.  Uh, maybe the instant pain.  Yeah.  The bee more terrifying knowing it's happening, but a mosquito doing it, you know, after, after  he's done, I think it would be much more of a problem.  And the, the quick pain from the bee sting, but then you have that residual itching, big  bump on your nut kind of thing you got to deal with.  You got to do the whole thing. 
[00:08:30]  You do the thumb and forefinger.  Only a guy could know about the thumb and forefinger roll of the bag.  It's, you sit there like a dog scratching himself.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It is wonderful.  It's the other ecstasy.  That's the other ecstasy.  Oh, all right.  The other ecstasy.  No, sorry.  And we have wax worms.  Yeah.  Wax worms.  Which are the normal just.  Yeah, you brought a lot of tame insects, I got to tell you.  Yeah, these are, these are pretty, pretty tame.  These, these are, if you look at these, these are real maggots, regular house fly. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  They'll eat bodies and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah?  Which is always good for, you know, a guinea from Jersey.  Wow.  I've never seen maggots before.  All right.  She doesn't seem to like the maggots.  Very nice.  Okay.  Well, we got to thank you for bringing the bees in.  Yes.  And getting stung doing it.  Look at his right hand.  It's all swollen.  I know, it's all swollen.  You were taking Benadryl all night long?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it doesn't do what it does for most people, you know. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  You need the epi shot, right?  Yeah.  Why'd you get stung?  They didn't like being taken out of the hive at night.  Oh, are they sleeping?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got one of those hives.  Pissed off bees.  Yes.  And you woke them and they were, like, all biting you?  They bit me all over.  Oh, they were pissed off.  But we got a whole container.  There's got to be, what, 30, 40 in there?  Yeah, and I brought some backups just in case.  So what will you do with these when you don't have them?  I guess, I don't know if I'm going to even want to touch them after they've been, you know. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Probably just open up the container near the hive and see what happens.  Let me know they call them faggot bees after that.  See if they come back.  Boy, but those honeybees are nothing compared to the wasps I saw in that video last night.  Did you watch that, Hope?  I didn't see it.  Oh, God, it is unbelievable.  These killer wasps.  The hornets, Japanese hornets.  The hornets, yeah.  There were 30 of them that took out 30,000 honeybees, took out a whole colony.  30 of these huge wasps come flying in. 
[00:10:30]  One of them comes in, marks it.  Like, he goes out on a little scouting mission, marks the hive.  What, this is a video that shows the whole process?  I saw the clip of the Japanese hornets I told you about.  Yeah, yeah.  The Japanese hornets, and it's filmed very well.  I mean, they get these up-close views of everything.  They get inside the nooks and crannies in the hive and everything, and the hornet flies  back to his crew and goes, hey, I found some honeybees.  I marked it with some theramon or whatever the hell they call it.  Yeah.  And then they take off, and they get to the honeybee hive, and just with these huge jaws 
[00:11:00]  start biting these bees in half.  They were just, and you're watching bee heads falling and bodies just kind of shaking around.  They went through the entire colony in what?  Three hours.  Three hours.  It took 30 of these wasps to kill 30,000 honeybees.  And they couldn't gang up on the wasps?  Were they trying?  They were trying.  They killed, like, a couple of them with the stingers that they have, but just no match. 
[00:11:30]  But then, at the end, they showed this honeybee colony that has a system.  The wasp comes in.  This hornet comes in to the tracking hornet, the initial just one, and as he's laying down  his theramones, the honeybees gather around him and start shaking.  And from their shaking, they work up so much friction that it gets up to 120 degrees.  And the bees can take 120 degrees. 
[00:12:00]  The hornet can't.  How the hell do they figure that out?  They cook the hornet alive, and he never gets to go back and tell his crew where they are.  And they just figure this out.  Yeah.  You gotta love nature.  Yeah.  They did this little weird abdominal shift thing.  The hornet flies in.  All these honeybees are sitting there, kind of moving.  And then, all of a sudden, every one of them goes,  quarter turn to the left.  And that told all of them to jump on this hornet and start shaking.  Like, where does that come from?  It's the way you feel as a white guy when you walk into a black club. 
[00:12:30]  You just feel like everybody is doing some kind of a signal, and they're gonna attack you  at any second.  You walk into the wrong bar, and you feel like everybody's just kind of, like, looking at  you and signaling each other.  That is crazy.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're gonna get to you and your honeybees in a little while, bro.  Thank you so much for helping out the show.  Thank you.  We just didn't think we were gonna pull off the old B-trick today.  No.  Thank God.  Those holes are too small.  Too big, I mean.  They're covered up with some kind of...  Yeah, there's some kind of breathing.  ...membrane.  I wouldn't even touch that, though, because I'd be afraid one of them would poke their 
[00:13:00]  stinger up through that gauze.  Yeah, I had a plastic bag originally, and they were stinging me even through the plastic  bag.  Oh.  Yeah, he just got stung like crazy.  Now, here's the...  Where's the contraption?  Let's bring the contraption in again.  Is this...  Are we going with the contraption?  Yeah, because Intern Bill modified the thing.  Oh, Intern Bill did.  Yeah, bring Intern Bill in.  Is it true that you tried to collect Intern Bill as a new insect?  Here's Bill.  Here's the phallic apparatus that the boys will be using today. 
[00:13:30]  Got two of them.  And we just learned that someone's gonna have to blow into the tube to get the honeybees  riled up.  Riled up, because they don't like human breath.  Bill, are you willing to blow into the tube?  No.  Blow into it?  Yeah.  While it's attached to the guy, though.  But the guy's gotta put his sack in there, and then you have to blow it...  Well, you don't have to get more than a foot away from his bag, because you gotta blow  in the front of that tube.  You gotta blow into the front of the phallic tube, yeah.  There's gotta be better ways than that. 
[00:14:00]  How about if...  Maybe you can just blow on his balls and then put the thing on real fast after.  Oh, yeah.  Just trying to be helpful.  Now, how did you modify it?  Well, instead of just using whatever we originally had, I put gloves, latex gloves, and stretch  them out across the hole which the balls are gonna go in.  And the balls will fit through comfortably?  Comfortably enough that the bees won't get out.  And the bees won't be able to get out?  No.  As long as they don't rip them out while the bee's stinging them and pulls them out, within  moderation, this should work very well. 
[00:14:30]  With basic odds, what are the odds?  We gotta remove some of that tape around that so we can watch the bees.  Yeah, we gotta be able to watch it.  So cut it away, maybe.  Maybe cut it away slightly.  I'm trying to razor it off.  Yeah, razor it off or something.  Yeah, we gotta be able to see that.  The backs, I'm trying to keep open as the windows, mostly.  Well, also, we see the back of his balls.  That's wonderful.  No, see, but...  Well, the problem is, this is the only part you're not gonna be able to see, because  this is gonna be up against their body.  His taint.  Yeah.  Yeah, we need to clear that open.  I think they're gonna do it like this? 
[00:15:00]  Well, they might be able to do it...  Or they could do it sideways, because they're just dropping it in, right?  It can really go any way.  I guess you're right.  It doesn't have to stick out like a big penis.  I would just make more room so we can see from other angles, I guess.  Odds-wise, what are the odds, as you're loading the bees in here, that some bees will escape  into this studio?  He's not an expert at this.  We're fucked.  Yeah, I've never done this.  This is close to 100 bees, the more I look at this container.  Yeah, I don't know how...  And we need to get just a few in these tubes.  I don't know how we're gonna transfer them.  How would you load bees into that? 
[00:15:30]  I think we're gonna get a plastic tube, and we're gonna try to transfer them that way.  This way, they'll go through the tube into that thing, and then we'll close it off.  Sure, they will.  The neat thing is gonna be that when honeybees sting, they die afterward because they lose  their stinger.  Yeah.  So their stinger will actually be stuck in their balls, and they'll just keep pumping  away, secreting that poison.  Is that what it does?  Yeah.  And then, so if you don't let them pull that stinger out, it'll just make everything just  a little worse.  Oh, God. 
[00:16:00]  Wasps can sting multiple times, so...  Yeah.  Are they gonna go after the bees in these things?  Wait, we have wasps?  Yeah, some guy showed me a wasp at some point.  Where?  We have more bees out there?  I don't know.  I don't know where he went.  He just had a wasp and a gerber jar.  Oh, yeah, there he is.  Oh, bring him in.  Who has wasps?  Who's this guy?  I don't know.  He's got some goodies, too, though.  Hey, bro.  What's up, man?  How's it going?  I found that mic there.  You brought a wasp in?  I got a bunch of wasps. 
[00:16:30]  How'd you get these?  We work for the phone company.  Yeah.  And they sting the shit out of us all the time.  I bet.  Holy crap.  Got two singles and two jars with four.  How'd you get them?  Mike dug them out of a pedestal yesterday.  Oh, these are yellow jackets, no?  No, they're paper wasps.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that wasp is nasty.  And then if we heat this up, those guys will be dancing around like your bee sound effects.  Oh, God. 
[00:17:00]  Is that a whole nest in there?  Yeah, pretty much.  Holy crap.  Wait, what do you do?  When you're up on the pole, you're going to grab something and they just fucking attack you?  You pop a terminal open and right in your face.  And you look like a lunatic waving your hard hat in the air.  I got the spray with me that we kill him with just in case.  Why don't you spray it before you open it?  Sometimes we do.  If you see an opening, you squirt it in the sides.  If you see them kind of swarming around before you open it.  How many times have you gotten stung on the job?  I got it about over half a dozen.  Most notable being on the flat part of my ear. 
[00:17:30]  I used to get that with attic jobs when we do jobs in the attic.  And I would just leave.  I'd be like, hey, there's bees here.  I'm not doing the job.  Fuck it.  Hey, yo.  They were all like clustered up.  Oh, it's just so goddamn frightening.  But with this, with these, all you got to do is open a jar and press it against his nuts and rattle it up a little bit.  If we heat that up, like last night when we were in the office breaking them up, they were crawling and very active.  But overnight, it's cool now.  Pissed off. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, it gets a little colder.  Right.  Oh, I got the heebie-jeebies officially.  Yeah, that little nest there.  Who is this?  The ooper?  Youper.  The youper.  What's up?  Hey, I love the show, guys.  I just wanted to say when you get one of your boys to blow in a tube, make sure it's not E-Rockers.  Bad Beth will kill a bee.  Well, the joke was made earlier, sir.  All right.  You're more nervous you went bad Beth. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, I do.  Say it right.  I've noticed on Pal Talk, the girls showing up a lot earlier today on the Pal Talk cams.  Anytime guys' testicles are going to be exposed here on the program, the ladies figure it's their day.  Well, who's going to be the expert here?  On balls or bees?  On bees.  I'll determine if someone's stung.  My method is very simple.  If they scream and drop a jar, we have to check.  Well, how are we going to get these bees into the contraption? 
[00:19:00]  Well, they're pretty slow right now.  I could probably wrangle a couple in there.  Can we do this outside?  Yeah, this will be done outside of the studio.  No, I mean outside.  Oh, you mean outside outside?  It'd be better because they'd stay cold.  Yeah?  As long as they're cold, they're going to move around like that.  Let me bring them in and heat them up.  Don't drop those.  And they're going to get nuts.  I got no problem.  Callously?  Yes.  Carelessly.  No, callous.  Yeah?  Wouldn't callously be if he was like throwing them around and spitting on them? 
[00:19:30]  Yes, that was kind of why I was saying that the way he was handling them to me was callous.  All right.  Also, with wasps, I believe your creepy guy could confirm this, but they don't lose their stinger like bees.  No.  They're just going to keep jabbing and jabbing and jabbing.  Yeah.  They're a tough guy.  And these guys aren't allergic to bees?  The Super Bowl guys?  What they say.  How did you get that nest?  You just dug it out?  Well, yeah.  Just knocked it right out of the tunnel into a jar. 
[00:20:00]  Actually, into a water bottle.  Really?  He squeezed all that through the neck of a water bottle, and last night I cut the water bottle  open and started to break them up into individual jars.  Whoa.  Ballsy move.  Ballsy move, my friend.  So, all right.  Game on.  We have plenty of bees.  We have wasps.  We have something that looks like yellow jackets, but they're not, you're saying.  They're paper wasps.  I looked up yesterday to let Steve know exactly what they were.  Okay.  Paper wasps.  I have no problem with them loading that outside.  Yeah.  Just so there's a complete barrier between us here in the studio and loose bees. 
[00:20:30]  Well, there's a lot of bees.  That's the problem.  I can understand if we try to transfer one or two and it gets loose, whatever.  But there's like, I mean, that jar is close to 100.  No, I don't even want one bee loose in here.  And this is, uh...  Turn it over.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look how many are on the bottom.  Yeah, the whole bottom.  Yeah, kidding.  There's got to be close to 100 in this jar as well.  And then individual wasps.  You know, mixing them together might really get them angry.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  Like different camps? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  You mix the wasps and the honeybees and stuff.  Oh, big race war.  Some kind of conglomerated, a lot of mongrel class bees.  The balls will be the battlefield.  Yeah, that's for sure.  That's great.  And this is just the grand finale.  Yeah.  Finale, excuse me.  The ultimate challenge.  It's the ultimate challenge.  This is like a decathlon of the nutsack.  We're just waiting for the beekeeper suits.  They're coming at 8 o'clock. 
[00:21:30]  I want a beekeeper suit.  All right.  I'm going to have to put a beekeeper suit on.  Let's bring the EMT guys in.  Yeah, let's see some of the dangers involved.  You guys can hang out.  Just go to the back wall for a little bit.  We don't have many mics, that's why.  Here they are.  Here are the EMT guys.  They're outside the studio almost every morning to say hi to us.  And now we finally need them.  Our buddies.  Anytime we need them, they are here to help out.  Never a dull moment with you boys.  I got to shut up.  No, and they have been there for all the fun things. 
[00:22:00]  They were there at the Hard Rock.  Remember the Hard Rock when someone suggested, what was the really bad suggestion that we  knocked down?  Somebody wanted to swallow a knife.  Yeah, a guy wanted to swallow a knife.  Oh, yeah.  For St. Paddy's Day.  And we were dead set against that.  And these guys kind of confirmed that that was a real stupid thing to do.  So we just had a guy piss his pants.  Which is harmless, good harmless fun.  We had a drunk come up on stage and piss his pants in front of hundreds of people.  Well, what else have you guys been involved with with us? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, Jesus.  55-gallon drum challenge.  55-gallon drum challenge, that's right.  Were you the ones that dragged the one girl out on a stretcher?  Yeah, the one that got the cockroach in her ear.  Nice.  She got a cockroach in her ear, and they couldn't get it out with their equipment there, so she  had to be brought to the hospital.  Now, the fun part of that was it wasn't just a cockroach in her ear.  She had been in the drum for quite a while, and we had been dumping cow blood on her and  all kinds of disgusting stuff.  So as these guys are taking her down in the stretcher, she's covered in blood. 
[00:23:00]  It looked like she had been just stabbed hundreds of times.  The building was horrified.  People were horrified.  Horrified.  Yeah.  But they took her down there and pulled it out of her ear.  New York being the wonderful city.  Nobody just, no, this stalking look.  Got a gawk.  The maniacal look of madmen.  If there were camera phones back then, it would have been a lot, a lot of pictures.  So the beekeeper's suits or whatever are coming.  The one guy has some spray that could calm the bees down if he gets too crazy. 
[00:23:30]  No, it kills them.  Kills them on contact?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Zyklon bee just seems to calm them down.  Yeah.  Good one.  And these guys are telling us they're not allergic, but let's say they have an allergic reaction.  That's why you guys are here.  Yeah.  The airway will close up.  They'll swell up, itching.  A whole lot of fun stuff.  The airway closes up.  Closes up.  An allergic reaction, the airway closes up, and that's why we're all concerned.  By the way, any of you boys allergic?  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:24:00]  Now, that's what I meant to ask.  We're all worried about the contestants.  How about you guys?  Does this, do you build up an allergy over time?  Or if you're not allergic at eight, will you maybe be allergic in your forties?  No straight answer to that.  It could change almost overnight.  It could just change.  You don't know.  Do you have stuff with you?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Show us what you got.  Got some epi.  Show us the tools of the trade.  Got the epi.  You got the pen thing?  The ambulance.  Cardiac monitor.  We got, not the pen thing.  We go direct for the IV drugs.  Nice.  I was given a pen thing because I had a really bad allergic reaction to, I think, I guess 
[00:24:30]  it turned out to be chickpeas or hummus or something.  Oof.  Nice.  And I was in the emergency room.  You were stung by a chickpea?  How does that even happen?  And then I went to an allergist and they wanted to give me one of these pens that you  stab yourself with.  Wow.  You have to stab yourself with it violently.  Yeah, it's a harpoon.  Oh my God.  It's like a harpoon.  Dude, they got the paddles.  You got the paddles?  Cardiac monitor.  Nice.  The whole nine yards.  Can you fire those babies up or what?  Hey, that's the finale.  That's the finale.  Right up to take the paddles to the balls. 
[00:25:00]  What would happen if he's looking for a new job?  Only before you do it.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What would happen if you took the paddles to the balls?  Not good, dude.  Not good?  Not good at all.  You can't even joke about that.  I hear if you do it, you do have to put the paddles and yell queer instead of the normal  queer.  It's kind of gay.  You know, I hear there are people that pay big money for that, too.  Yeah.  Wow.  Dropping in the tubes for the airway.  Manage their airway if we need be.  All right.  And yes, all the technical individuals out there, there is a medic in the room before 
[00:25:30]  you start getting all the phone calls.  Yeah.  It's not just some guy that bought the stuff on eBay.  I think I know how to use this.  Wow.  Great.  Oxygen tank behind me and a full drug kit.  All right.  I start whipping out the needles.  You got any puppies full of heroin?  Later.  Later.  Talk to me later.  I love that story.  Yeah, we'll get into that story after the break.  And a bambulance downstairs.  Bambulance.  Just in case we need a bambulance.  Got a bambulance.  Just for shits and grins.  The little voice in our head wants to say something.  The little voice in your head, don't do it. 
[00:26:00]  Don't do it.  Remember St. Pat's.  It's not like we're going to have this done in a church.  What do you mean?  Two wasps ass fucking in St. Pat's.  Get back for your career.  Not well.  Every once in a while, you got to take that chance.  Every once in a while, you got to take the chance.  Don't do it, boy.  Today, we roll the dice.  Super ball.  Today, we roll the dice.  Yeah.  It's super ball.  Super ball.  Super ball.  Super ball.  Super ball.  Dude, if something goes wrong in the company, we'll always stand behind you.  Way behind you. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Every once in a while, you got to just put it all on red.  Right.  That's what we do.  Spin the wheel.  Mike, the trucker.  What's up, Mike?  Good morning, man.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you, this show is just going to have to be an epic production.  I already have my jaw on the steering wheel shaking my head already at 7 o'clock this morning.  Well, I didn't expect this many bees, because we were having a real problem finding bees,  and now we have too many.  It's going to get utterly fucking chaotic in that studio. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I think so.  I love it.  Later.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dana, the trucker.  Dana.  Hey, hey.  How you doing?  All right.  You guys got girls coming in.  Why not get the girls to blow through the tube for you?  Dana.  We have girls coming in today?  We do.  Why are we listening to Dana?  Are you scheduling our guests?  No, I thought you guys said you guys had girls coming in today.  No.  It's just another sausage factory.  Oh, man. 
[00:27:30]  That sucks.  All I see is guys everywhere we look.  No, we don't want girls coming in.  But it's safer that way, trust me.  Women wreck radio shows unless they're getting naked.  Two years later, she'd be in court saying, they held my head to the tube and made me blow.  I was degraded.  Shut up.  Shut up.  How disorganized are we, though?  A caller suggests something, and we're like, really?  All right.  All right.  Must be sold.  Good.  Good.  Girls are coming in.  All right.  Maybe we just forgot.  I don't know.  Bring them right in.  All right, Dana.  Thanks.  Thanks.  All right.  So I think we're all set, and the guys are here, the contestants, the competitors. 
[00:28:00]  Everyone's here.  How does that?  Wow.  That never happens.  I'm stunned.  They're here?  The guys?  Iraq?  Wow, Iraq.  Hawk?  Iraq's got a look on his face.  How about you turn on the wireless mic you're holding first of all?  Yeah, what are you trying to do?  Before you look around close, maybe you should turn on the mic.  Iraq has a clueless, surprised look on his face that I can only describe as Iraq.  Iraq.  Thanks.  That's right.  Come on, Poxitoni Eric. 
[00:28:30]  I'm in here.  I didn't see if the contestants come in here yet.  I was trying to find out for you.  How do you find out by looking around the room?  Yeah, how?  Checking in the other studio.  Maybe they saw the contestants come in.  I don't know.  You think they're going to help you with a nod?  They're going to let you swing and not know what you're talking about.  They're going to let you just sweat.  Hang you out.  You should know that by now.  Steve.  Iraq, prognosticator of prognosticators, has determined nothing.  Wah, wah, wah.  Huh?  Jesus.  Steve, we got the contestants here?  I saw two of them outside. 
[00:29:00]  I believe.  Two.  I think they were all contestants.  I don't know.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Can you tell when Steve puts his headphones on, people?  We get everyone out for just for now.  Right when he starts talking.  Yeah.  We got two of the guys here?  I think if one of the guys might have brought a couple extra people with him, but there are  people filling out paperwork, yes.  Yeah.  They're going to be filling out paperwork for the next hour and a half.  Yeah, they absolutely will.  Because just when people come in here to do dumb things, you've got to fill out a packet.  Oh, yeah.  I can only imagine what they're filling out today. 
[00:29:30]  Extensive.  Extensive paperwork.  Yeah.  Are you scared of these things, Steve?  Wasps?  Yeah.  Or not really.  I mean, I've been stung by a bunch of them before.  It's not fun, but...  You want to just stick your hand in real fast?  Absolutely not.  Is it true your grandfather visited Cuba in 1956?  Yeah, I don't see what that has to do with my ball bag going in a bee jar.  Right, well...  Are you or were you ever a member of the Communist Party, sir?  Have to ask these questions, gentlemen.  That is very funny.  Let's say hi to Joe in Brooklyn. 
[00:30:00]  Joe?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hi, Joe.  All right, two things.  First thing is those wasps that the Verizon guys got there.  I work for Verizon and the wasps are no fucking joke.  We've been stung by them once you go up on a pole.  Secondly, Ron and Fez have got to be fucking panicking because you guys know that Ronnie  says, quote, these guys have no sense of fucking history.  Every time you guys do a bit, they panic because they think they're going to walk in  and have no job.  It is a pretty crazy way to run your life. 
[00:30:30]  I know.  I don't like doing this either, any more than Opie doesn't.  It's our job, though.  It's our job to lay it all on the line every once in a while.  What can I tell you?  It's nice being back, you know, at the base every so often, but sometimes you've got to  go out on patrol.  Yep.  Yep.  And you just go into that great unknown.  It just makes this show so special.  Right.  The chances we take.  And sometimes when you go on patrol, you leave without your weapon, just making the  Arabic woman noise alone. 
[00:31:00]  I know.  I know.  Listen, we are pretty stupid.  Let's go to Big Mike.  Big Mike.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you're going to have to have the other contestant blow into the tube for the other  guy who's got his ball back in there.  That ain't bad.  Because that way, it's like playing defense on football, you know?  You got the, you anger them more.  If you got, like, Jimmy or Ben doing it, then it's, you know, you don't know if it's the  same thing.  Yeah, the other guy's going to do it with some gusto.  Yeah.  The harder you blow, the more pissed the bee gets. 
[00:31:30]  The angrier the bee's going to get.  What a great idea.  We'll have them 69 each other.  Right.  That's another ball back challenge, too.  Oh, fantastic.  That is great.  Thanks, guys.  Watch it out.  I hope everyone saw the contraption on opnathtly.com.  It's ridiculously phallic.  And now we learn that someone has to blow into the tube to get the bees excited.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm a little nervous today.  Just a little.  I'm getting that feeling that I get just every once in a while. 
[00:32:00]  You know what I love, though?  Have you had it twice already?  I've had the feeling only twice.  Yes.  I love the fact.  No, actually.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you, Anthony.  I'm just going to.  Actually, I've had that feeling since coming to XM a lot, which is ridiculous considering  our history.  Yeah.  Like, you would think coming into this new gig, we would never get that feeling again.  I could think of three times already that I've had this exact feeling I have today.  But it's been cleared. 
[00:32:30]  This has all been cleared, Opie.  And when you know when it's been cleared, nothing can happen.  You're a stupid man.  It's not like Sex for Sam was something that had been done times before.  You're a stupid, stupid man.  It's not like everyone knew about it.  Oh, they did.  It's not like it had sponsors.  Oh, it did.  This has been cleared by everybody. 
[00:33:00]  Everyone's signing release forms.  This sounds way too familiar.  Oh, God.  I'm buying a house.  The only reason they accepted this is because I'm sure they sold that shit out of it.  Oh.  Well, maybe they didn't have the heart to tell you guys that they're just not interested  anymore.  And this is their way of doing it.  Like, yeah, go ahead.  Do the contest.  You know, I thought that exact thing last night when I was going to bed.  I'm like, what if they're playing us?  What if they don't want to pay out our contracts?  What if they really want to get rid of us, but they don't have the heart to do it face-to-face 
[00:33:30]  in office?  So they're like, they found out we're doing this and just said, yeah, let them do this.  Well, you know what?  I don't think they're doing that.  And it's like I always say.  I mean, my friends at Sirius.  I mean, that's a great company.  And Mel and those guys are probably, you know.  You know, Howard, a pioneer in satellite radio and the collection of people he's bringing  aboard.  Great, great talents.  Second to none.  Second to none.  And to tell you the truth, I would be honored to go over there and work for Sirius. 
[00:34:00]  Would you call Howard your boss?  He would be.  Why wouldn't I?  I would actually walk in and go, morning, boss.  Morning, boss.  No name.  Right.  Sellouts.  Let's go to Jeremy in Jersey.  Jeremy.  Hello.  Hey.  Listen.  Harvey Keitel said, you're going to be okay.  You're going to be okay.  Yeah, we need that clip today to make ourselves feel better. 
[00:34:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, live from Washington, D.C., it's ELO.  I don't know what the most repulsive thing was, was actually hearing the word Howard and  my boss come out of all three of your mouths.  I did not say Howard and boss.  Here's the other thing.  I have never in my life seen more preparation.  I saw an email yesterday that said, okay, video the contestants signing the release, burn  me two copies of the DVDs and FedEx to them.  That was an actual email that was exchanged yesterday. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  And they're videotaping them, filling out the paperwork?  I mean, I don't know what else you can do.  Yeah.  I'm just here calling, assuring you, I have your back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know something?  You sound just like another great hero during our career days.  Don't say it.  Ken Stevens.  Our friend Ken Stevens.  Did we tell you what Ken is doing now?  He's on a sailboat somewhere.  In the Chesapeake Bay.  He's sailing somewhere in the Chesapeake Bay.  When you go to lunch today, why don't you wave to Ken? 
[00:35:30]  He's out there somewhere.  I heard he talks to a volleyball that he has a handprint of blood on.  The guy hasn't shaved in three years.  He's hanging out with mermaids and a volleyball.  Yeah.  It's all part of my plan to get on my boat.  Ken Stevens.  The old Ken Stevens.  We've got to call him live on the show one day.  Yeah, I want to talk to Ken.  Our old boss.  We liked Ken very much.  Yes.  All right.  I just wanted to dispel what we call the jock paranoia.  Yeah, we have that.  But you can't blame us. 
[00:36:00]  I really can't blame us.  I remember those moments as well with this show going on, what, 19 months or whatever  the hell it's been now.  Yeah.  Our show?  Yeah.  I mean, I can think of a few moments.  We're into our 17th month.  I can think of a few moments when my phone rang.  I'm like, uh-oh, here we are again.  Yeah, of course.  See, I'm from the school of thought that some of the more tamer things that we didn't prepare  for were more dangerous than the bigger things that we do prepare for.  Like, the tamer thing.  So what? 
[00:36:30]  Perhaps there was a little drinking going on.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony's Sirius XM.  Yeah, it's Uncle Paul.  Paul Hogg is here.  And I'm hosting the Christmas special for the Opie and Anthony show while they're away  doing nothing.  I come in here after babysitting all day, cleaning the cranberry juice off the front  of my undershorts.  Join a holiday-themed trip through the ONA archives as the Opie and Anthony channel presents

You're listening to the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  On the virus, Sirius XM.  All right, we're getting ready for Super Bowl.  On the O.P. and Anthony program.  On XM Satellite Radio.  People are starting to pile into the Pal Talk rooms. 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  The contestants are here filling out lots and lots of paperwork.  They're getting videotaped.  Making all sorts of statements on video.  Is there any betting going on?  What kind of betting can we do?  I don't know.  We'll get the contestants in here in a little while, but they're definitely going through all the paperwork.  I bet that I can sleep late tomorrow without being late for work.  What was the other thing I was going to say? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Steve comes in here.  You know Steve.  And E-Rock goes, Steve, what's wrong?  He goes, oh, this is so stressful.  Half the stuff that these guys brought in will never make it into the studio.  We have to say no right off the bat.  Really?  So we should get Steve in here.  Steve is shrugging.  What, it was bad to mention this?  Grr.  Maybe Steve is just sick of coming in here and getting abused.  I think Steve is just disgusted.  Steve, what's wrong?  No, no, no, no, no.  I saw you kind of rolling your eyes as I said that in the other studio. 
[00:42:30]  You know, I, whatever.  Yeah, some of the stuff they brought in, you know, will not make it on the air.  Like what?  Like what?  Vice grips.  Well, yeah, vice grips are a little much.  Yeah.  I don't think you're going to be able to do anything with vice grips.  Yeah, no, anything.  Well, one guy was going to bring one of those industrial like C-clamp kind of vices.  Yeah.  He was going to bring that.  That got nuked last night.  What else got nuked last night?  Rat trap. 
[00:43:00]  A rat trap would cut your ball sack off.  Completely off.  Someone sent in a few rat traps in a cardboard box this morning.  We looked at them and they almost took my finger off when I was like setting.  Do you have them here?  Yeah, bring in the rat trap.  Oh, bring in one.  At least one.  All right.  Maybe bring in two.  I want to see a rat trap.  Bring in the stuff you said no to.  Yeah.  Okay.  Just lay it on the table.  This is kind of like the video you get to see when they do the airport stories and stuff  and they show you the box of stuff they got off people.  Here's what we have confiscated so far. 
[00:43:30]  I want to see the stuff they're saying no to.  I want this contest to be safe.  I think that they should let in cotton balls and maybe some sugar, perhaps an apple.  Things that tickle.  Yeah.  So that the one that giggles the most.  Loses.  He loses.  So.  Wow.  These two lovely devices are rat traps.  Let me see that.  Here we go.  Wow.  Those look like.  Looks like someone built the better one.  Somebody was going to take this to their nutsack?  They wanted to.  Get the fuck out of here.  That is.  You know what that is? 
[00:44:00]  It's a miniature bear trap.  Yeah.  Dude.  That is a bear trap.  All right.  Let me try.  Put something in there.  Give me something that.  Oh.  No thanks.  Look at this.  Dude.  Watch this.  No.  It's going to flip up or something.  Is it on pal talk?  Oh my God.  Look at this.  Is it on pal talk?  It's like a bear trap.  Whoa.  You know, dangerous, yes, but I'm intrigued by these things.  Here.  No.  It's not going to attack you on its own. 
[00:44:30]  It can.  Let's play toss the rat trap.  Let's not.  I don't want to play toss the rat trap.  Kind of like, you know, the old egg toss game.  Let's play it with a rat trap.  Let's not and say we did.  Hey, Jim.  No.  Don't toss the rat trap.  Oh my God.  Wow.  The whole trap jumps up.  That's frightening.  Yeah.  Can you take a finger to that, you think?  No.  No, no, no.  Why not?  No, no, no.  Wait a minute.  You might be able to take a finger to it.  It's just like a big.  It really hurts.  Just.  Yeah.  Just snap. 
[00:45:00]  Just.  Ow.  Okay.  Shit.  It's called T-Rex.  It's a black.  It looks like a black mouth with teeth on it.  The trap's called T-Rex?  That was at barely half volume on my hand, and it really hurt.  You see that?  It doesn't look like a mouth.  I feel like I'm trying to sneak a muffin past Patrice.  Like, uh.  Oh, he got it.  Oh, those things rock.  Yeah, I kind of like these. 
[00:45:30]  Someone has to take a body part in there just to try it out.  I can't load mine now.  Let me see.  Oh, yes, you can.  Oh.  It's supposed to snap.  You broke it already?  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  Ow.  It doesn't hurt.  It hurts a lot.  It doesn't.  Oh, good.  You broke it.  That one's busted.  Oh.  There it is.  Okay.  Hope you load it.  Guy, put your hand in there.  No, no, don't do it.  Please, don't.  Do it at 11.  We have EMTs here, though.  Holy shit.  No, you're crazy.  You're crazy.  You'll break your hand. 
[00:46:00]  Why?  It will break your hand.  That's designed to snap around.  Dude, I'm doing this right here.  Yeah.  Just being closed like that really fucking hurts.  Yeah.  I closed it around like my knuckle.  Ah!  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Look what it did to the pen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It broke it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you just cracked your pen.  All right, so they can't use this on their scrotum?  Oh, God.  Imagine your scrote in that. 
[00:46:30]  Nope.  No rat trash.  There's no way to, like, to disarm it without, like, popping it.  There's no way to disarm it.  Right.  Stop throwing them.  Well, maybe if you give it to your eyes.  So disarming.  Disarm it, Jim.  Let me just give it these baby blues.  Blink, blink.  And by the way, I got to say, we got to talk about Rich Voss at one point today, because  I heard he did everything.  Oh, my God.  We got the audio.  Yeah, I listened.  We got to get him on the phone, or could he stop by, even?  Is he in the area?  Maybe we could get Voss to stop by.  Did the miscarriage.  He did the miscarriage joke on commercial radio. 
[00:47:00]  And the laughter that comes out of those guys' mouths to try to cover up for just a horrific  story is worth the price of admission.  Oh, really?  All right.  Which is free.  Because it's, you know, what they call free.  We'll check that out a little later.  John.  I have the sniffles.  I see that.  Stay away from me.  No.  I just got over the flu.  I won't give it right back.  It took three fucking weeks to get rid of the flu.  Hopefully it doesn't go to full-blown sniffles.  No, I don't have FBS.  John in Virginia.  John?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey. 
[00:47:30]  I just want to let you know, before I let you know what my plans are for today, I'm calling  from Lynchburg, fucking Virginia, home of Jerry fucking Falwell.  And there's wow stickers already in this conservative town.  Oh, cool.  Good.  Love it.  Hey, listen.  Here's my plan.  I got up an hour early just to listen to the Super Bowl.  Told my wife I got to go to work early.  Called my boss.  Called in sick.  I'm sitting in my minivan.  Yeah, the six-pack.  I'm ready to roll.  All right.  Yeah, we got to make a day of it.  They're tailgating, Opie.  They're tailgating.  For Super Bowl.  Oh, it is Super Bowl.  Punch out. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  Are the guys done with their paperwork?  Almost.  Almost.  Almost.  We have to get videotaped statements from them.  And the vice grips.  Oh, yeah.  The vice grips was a no.  Those weren't going to pass you there.  The vice grips.  I'm amazed we're doing this today, by the way.  We've been trying for five years to do the old beasting to the ball bag.  This started at WNEW.  We were told we had a great prize.  An Aztec.  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't mention the prize because these guys are kind of doing it for free today.  No, but I'm mentioning the prize because we never got it. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  Wasn't that stupid?  What's his name?  Our promotion guy, Roger.  Roger, Roger, I am going to get you guys two Aztecs to give away.  It's like, oh, great.  Okay, that sounds good.  And then we came up with the beasting thing, and they said no.  And then they told us we didn't have the Aztec.  It was a bunch of bullshit.  So we gave away an actual Aztec Indian, who I hope is still with that family.  Just standing there in front of the cigar store. 
[00:49:00]  Drunk in the gutter on 57th Street.  Ah, juicy fruit.  All right, we get it.  Just keep mopping.  Just keep mopping.  All right.  As the guys fill out the rest of their paperwork and do their video statements so they don't  sue anyone.  What are you, Rob?  Ben?  The bee suits are in it.  The bee suits are here?  Yes.  Ooh.  How many?  Let the Super Bowl begin.  Three beekeeper suits?  Yeah, bring the beekeeper suits in.  Are they heavy? 
[00:49:30]  Are they thick and hot?  They're nice.  Are they nice and lightweight?  And where are the contestants?  Do they fill out all their paperwork?  Ooh.  Wait, Ben, get on mic.  Did you hear that?  What?  As they bring on the bee a little while, they're still filling out the paperwork.  I go, Ben.  Wow.  He goes, they're not even close to finished with the paperwork.  It's going to be a little while.  Yeah.  All right.  Those look silly.  And trust me, we're not trying to stall to make you listen longer because...  Did you hear what Jimmy just said?  What, what, what, what?  I said, those look silly.  Those look silly.  Of course, they're beekeepers outfits. 
[00:50:00]  Jimmy, they're always silly.  Jimmy, put the thing on.  I don't want to.  I'm going to look dumb.  I was going to call it a hat, but is it a hat?  Yeah, I guess it is a hat.  All right.  I didn't see the hat part.  Put that on.  What's silly in this?  Put that on for PalTalk and get a picture for opianthony.com.  I want my beekeeper hat.  Oh, my God.  I don't like wearing a beekeeper hat.  I don't like it.  Can I see that one? 
[00:50:30]  I feel like a boy in a cage.  All right.  And Anthony has his beekeeper hat.  Look, it's got like...  Hey, kook, why don't you take your regular hat off first?  Yeah.  Which way does it go?  Over the head.  What do you think?  Yeah, right over your head.  Yeah, netting first.  And Anthony has his beekeeper hat net thing on.  I'm ready.  Ugh, you look just like me.  No, I don't.  That is really creepy.  You know what the most frustrating thing is?  I feel like we're at the end of a movie and we want to kiss, but our beekeeper masks are 
[00:51:00]  preventing us from doing so.  Brokeback beekeepers.  I don't know how to quit you.  You look ridiculous.  No, it won't work that way, you goose.  He's trying to put the headphones on.  Let me try it under my beekeeper.  There we go.  All right.  All right.  I'm rocking now.  Hello, caller?  Hello?  Hello, caller? 
[00:51:30]  I can't hear the caller, Opie.  And we got the wasps.  Yes.  We got the wasp hanging out.  Some bees.  I am so excited.  How's that?  Oh, it works with the headphones.  Yeah, but the hat doesn't go quite over your head.  You just kind of...  Why does the hat have to look so wacky?  It's fucking awful.  Why does the hat have to look wacky?  Dude, I want a Kango beekeeper hat outfit.  All right.  Thank you, by the way.  There you go.  Oh, that's better.  Now I can hear. 
[00:52:00]  You know who you look like?  The guy from Poltergeist 2?  God is in his holy temple?  Oh, when he's talking through the screen?  Yeah.  When the old man comes to the screen door?  You're all gonna die.  You're all gonna get stung.  All right.  All right.  Well, we're just stalling and waiting for the guys to pull out their paperwork before we start Super Bowl.  I might just wear this.  Like on the way home, driving.  Let's just walk down the street in our beekeeper fucking...  You know what you do?  Two of us walk down the street in our beekeeper uniforms and we'll walk anywhere and just stand there and people will think that there's bees all over. 
[00:52:30]  There's bees.  Miss, miss.  I have to check your panties.  Clear the way.  Anyone have a hammer?  What, um...  Sir?  Sir.  Beekeeper guy.  Beekeeper suit guy.  Why does Opie get the prettier one?  What is that one?  This is, uh, this is an antique beekeeper.  Give that to Opie, the old one.  I don't want that.  An antique.  Yeah.  And you put the whole suit on.  Yeah.  And then you zip the, uh, you know, you zip the veil.  You zip the neckline around the collar of the suit. 
[00:53:00]  I see.  Now, what, what else about, like, wrist protection or gloves or...  Well, you should be wearing gloves and if you didn't bring your gloves, you know, you're pretty much...  You're fucked.  You're pretty much beat.  I'm gonna pull my hands in the sleeves and rubber band them shut.  Yeah, then, actually, the newer suits, they may have a little elastic on the, uh, on the wrists.  Because I don't want them crawling up my arms or legs.  You definitely don't want that.  Nobody does.  No.  You guys look really silly.  Well, yeah, but you know what? 
[00:53:30]  Silly, but safe.  You look beyond silly.  Why does anyone have...  There's one...  Anthony and I have little hats.  This is to be...  You're supposed to wear this with a hat.  You put the hat on.  You gotta bring your own hat?  A regular hat, yeah.  That's stupid.  Well, see, they've advanced.  They've...  But, yeah, because the beat could get in through that hat hole.  Yes.  I don't like that.  Yeah, it's...  I don't want that.  We're wearing, like...  You have the right one.  This looks like it's sort of like a Park Ranger hat.  Yeah.  And it's got, like, screen all the way around it.  Well...  And then this very flexible screen to the bottom of it that zips into the suits. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, well, the pictures will be up on opianthony.com.  I like this.  Yeah.  Someone's got to roll video on this so I could superimpose huge giant bees invading our studio tonight.  Yeah, Japanese hornets.  Yes.  Get some Japanese hornets.  Okay, I'm going to do this.  All right, someone roll tape on this.  All right, I'm waving them all around.  I'm trying to get them off of me.  Okay.  Ah, ah, ah. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, that'll look good.  I have to do it in the background, too, because it would look silly if bees were only in your side.  If just me, bees would love you, too, Jimmy.  That's right.  We'll look like assholes.  Screw that.  How do you drink a beverage in your bee suit?  Yeah, I never thought of that.  What if the beekeeper gets thirsty?  Yeah.  You have to plan ahead.  Yeah, you've got to drink and piss.  Any kind of bodily function has to be done beforehand?  What if you have diarrhea and there's bees all over?  What if you have diarrhea and you want to get blown?  What do you do?  How are you sure the bees are off of you before you take the suit off? 
[00:55:00]  You should do it with a partner.  Yes.  Ah, that's sexy, too.  Always good with a partner.  That makes it sexy.  What are you doing back there?  Checking for bees.  Checking for bees.  Checking for bees.  That's it.  And gathering the honey.  Jesus.  Open that up.  Let me scoop my hand in it.  See if there's no bees on it.  Yeah, because I always, anytime you see a beekeeper working, I see it on, like, the Discovery Channel, things like that.  There's bees all over them.  And they don't seem to care. 
[00:55:30]  And it petrifies me.  Yeah, and even if you know you don't have any bees on you anymore, when you're driving home in the truck, you think you still have bees on you.  Yeah.  Thanks for bringing in the bee suits.  Thank you.  You guys.  I also brought you some, these are T-Rex.  Oh, that was you?  Oh, that's you.  You crazy bastard.  These are rat snaps, but they're one-handed.  And they would really hurt.  Dude, how do you...  There's also a mouse.  Would that break your finger?  No.  No, it didn't.  No, what am I saying?  It could. 
[00:56:00]  It could.  It definitely would break your finger.  Yeah, make sure you get a lot of meat in there.  You know, I want to be brave enough to take one, but I don't know.  Do you break your finger?  Well, I think I would go in with my hand.  That's the way you got to do it.  The side of the meat of your hand.  That you could take.  Let me tell you something.  I rested it.  I opened it and closed it, like, slowly on my hand, like, on the, like, past the pinky where the bone is.  Yeah.  Just letting it rest there, it left, like, those little teeth indentations in my hand.  Right.  It's got teeth, like a bear trap.  Well, you know, the teeth, it's so that if the rat or the mouse is not killed immediately, he will be suffocated by the teeth. 
[00:56:30]  So, you know, they're thinking.  So your business is, like, pest control, obviously, but you would wear this bee suit if someone had a bee problem?  Actually, we don't really do bee work, but we like to have the suits handy.  Just in case.  You never know when you need them.  You got a big hornet's nest on the side of the house in the summertime, your kids are trying to go in the pool, and dad's got to dress up like this and go,  Honey, stay in the house, I'll take care of it, and just make a disaster out of the whole thing.  No, the best thing to do is wear your beekeeper suit when your friends don't have them, and then start rattling up the bees. 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  Hey, bees, you look like a bunch of faggots, and you swat the nest.  How hysterical would that be to have a big jar of bees go to a park during a picnic and just release them in your bee suit?  That's right.  Or you find the invalid kid in the wheelchair and just throw the bees on them.  And you could stand right there laughing at them because you have the bee suit on.  Do you want to hear a tragic story about a guy who, I think it was a killer bee story. 
[00:57:30]  It was a guy pushing his invalid kid, which is, of course, where I got that, in a wheelchair.  Oh, no.  In a wheelchair, and he pushed the kid into a ditch by accident at a park or something.  Accident.  And there was a whole killer bee nest in the ditch.  Oh, no, no.  And they swarmed up all over the little fella, and the guy tried to beat them off as somebody had to wind up running away.  So he leaves his kid in a wheelchair in a ditch being stung to death while he fucking hightails it out of there.  Oh, that is horrible.  That's not going to be some insurance questions on the claim. 
[00:58:00]  All right, we got the bee suits.  Ben, are they done with the paperwork?  No.  When are they going to be done with the paperwork?  It's time for Super Bowl.  We've got to videotape them signing the paperwork, saying they know what they're doing.  It's going to take a while.  Well, we actually should be done pretty soon.  We're moving faster now.  Because a lot of people are heading into work, so they're going to have to catch us on the replay, I guess.  I'm scared.  Which one are you wearing, Jimmy?  This one.  Will that, like, a jumpsuit type thing?  Is it a jumpsuit?  Yeah, it's a one-piece.  Will it fit over my clothing? 
[00:58:30]  Absolutely.  So I don't have to get naked in here in the studio again?  Oh, Anthony, stop it!  Sometimes after the show, me and Jim, you know.  But we're not really naked.  It's just a couple of hogs coming out for a peek.  Why not, I say.  Don't make it bad.  All right.  We're getting ready for Super Bowl.  They're videotaping the contestants as they fill out their paperwork.  We should be underway very, very soon.  Yeah.  This takes a while.  We want to make sure everything.  See, in the old days, it would have just been run in the studio, do it, big problem. 
[00:59:00]  Got the bees, got the wasp.  Yeah, we'd have been like, ah, my script, sure.  Rat trap, yeah, snap it on your nutsack, asshole.  Right.  And what happened?  What happened?  We would have gotten fired.  All right.  Scared.  Why are you scared?  I don't want to.  Hey, can't they sting through this screen if it, like.  Yeah, that's why they're designed that way.  Your nose like this?  No, they can't.  They can't get through there?  You know, guys, try to keep your head centered.  Right.  Don't lean forward.  Yeah, don't put your head like, don't sleep on it on the side.  I was going to, like, take a little nap, but if I lay on a bee, it's over. 
[00:59:30]  Let's.  Do you want Steve?  Yeah, let's get Steve and Ben in here.  Steve.  Well, we just want an update because we're live on the show.  Yeah.  Steve, he's disgusted.  The update is they're filling out their paperwork and we're videotaping.  And how much longer, Ben?  A couple minutes.  Really?  Yeah.  We just got to make sure that everything that they acknowledge on camera, that they know  what they're doing.  It's like a deposition.  Yeah.  It's very accurate.  25 to 30 minutes.  Ah, screw that. 
[01:00:00]  Wow.  I say we let the games begin.  Hey.  Oh, you asshole.  What did you do?  You are a fucking maniac.  Dude, what the fuck?  Where is it?  I didn't.  Oh, man.  Oh, jeez.  Zip up, fellas.  Oh, no.  I think I saw it fly off. 
[01:00:30]  You are an ass.  Why would you do that?  I hope you get cut on that glass now.  I think I see him.  We might need the spray to kill him.  Yeah, you think?  What else are you doing?  The games have begun.  I don't know where it is, but it's somewhere loose.  I don't know where it is in the studio. 
[01:01:00]  Jesus Christ.  Your face was priceless.  I don't like bees.  I hate them.  Well, I broke one of the jars that contained a few of them.  Where?  Oh, God.  All right.  Please.  Give me this suit.  Do you see him anywhere?  Do you see him?  No.  No, I don't. 
[01:01:30]  You're right, I think.  No.  Jesus.  His hair's all disheveled.  Did you see that?  Oh, what a mess.  Under all.  Well, you need to clean up the jar.  I'm shaking, because they're in here somewhere now.  Where's my bee suit?  They're quickly putting on their bee suits.  Jesus.  I don't like the fact that...  Dude, how do you cover your ankle?  My ankle's exposed.  No, it's pinched at the bottom.  You're all right.  It's not pinched that good.  Pull it down over the top of your arm. 
[01:02:00]  No, it'll bite me.  No.  Pull it down over the top of your shoe.  I'm a professional.  Holy...  Anthony.  Yeah.  No!  Right there.  Ah!  Right there.  Ah!  All right.  We should take a break.  The games have begun.  I get my bee suit on.  The games have begun.  It's the worst of the O.P.D. Anthony Show.  Can we start talking to the contestants, please?  Yeah, come on.  This show has just been one...  Enough of the videotape testimony.  Yeah, we get it.  I'm trying to drink coffee with my bee suit on. 
[01:02:30]  How are you doing that?  I'm in a bit of a quandary.  Can you drink it through the bee suit?  No, you can't.  I'm going to try.  Yeah, you can.  I'm sure that net is nice and clean.  Yeah, guys, hands have it all over.  It's filtering it.  I'm not that crazy.  All right.  Not yet.  Can we get the guys in here?  The paperwork from Washington is just fucking up our show today.  This is how I want to hold it.  This shouldn't take an hour and a half to prepare for a stupid bit that's going to take ten minutes. 
[01:03:00]  Here they are, ladies and gentlemen.  Sociopath number one.  All right.  And your name is?  Steve.  You are Steve.  Oh, this is the last minute guy from yesterday.  You're not allergic to bees, right?  No, I am not.  What did they make you fill out?  Just released a liability.  I hold you guys responsible for nothing.  It's all on my own.  All on your own.  All on your own.  And they got you on tape saying that too, right?  Yes, they did.  This is the same thing as if you just did it at home on your own in your basement. 
[01:03:30]  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Ben's laughing.  You laugh when a bee stings you.  Why are you laughing, Ben?  Jim just looks funny in his outfit.  You think?  Drinking his Starbucks.  A beekeeper's outfit.  But, of course, it looks ridiculous.  It's always good when there's a stretcher, you know, outside the studio.  I know.  We've taken all the precautions that we should.  Now, the bees are not in the contraptions yet, are they?  Yeah.  How are we going to get them in the contraptions?  Bill?  The bees are not currently in the contraptions. 
[01:04:00]  This is how it's going to work.  Yeah.  There's a safety gate between the actual unit that the balls are going in and the tube.  Yeah.  You put the bees in with the gate on, and you close the tube at the end, and then they're  going to put it on their balls, and when they're ready, they're going to open the gate,  and the bees will come into the container.  With their nuts.  Yes.  Because each one of you will have to blow into the tube to force the bee into the nutsack region.  Of the other man.  There's still a, uh, we have to figure out how we're going to get that. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, Bill, come on.  We need a blower.  All right.  And that's the ultimate challenge, by the way.  Hi, Steve.  Look at this cocky guy.  This is Raphael, right?  Sir.  I can tell.  This is Raphael from Connecticut, Anthony.  Representing the CT.  Yes.  Raphael from Connecticut started this whole ball bag abuse thing.  He suggested the mousetrap to the nutsack.  Yep.  He couldn't get down here in time, so Matt stole your thunder.  And now that video is being downloaded all over the world like crazy.  Raphael was not happy about that, so he challenged Matt to a ball bag abuse. 
[01:05:00]  To a Super Bowl.  Yeah, to a Super Bowl, basically.  What did you bring in for your nutsack today?  I brought in a, uh, I call it the chomper.  The little spatula that you pull back and just, ooh.  Ooh.  That's kind of interesting.  I brought some vice grips, but they said it was too dangerous.  Yeah.  I brought the glue traps in.  They shot the glue traps down.  You can't do the glue traps down.  No, they won't.  They will not let us do the glue traps.  Why?  They shot them down.  What's the, I want a reason.  I didn't get a reason.  Uh, let me, let me play devil's advocate because they can rip your ball skin off. 
[01:05:30]  I will not rip your ball skin off.  I'm just saying that's probably what they're thinking of.  It's just, it's, it's, it's sticky stuff.  It's like flypaper.  It would just remove hair, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  What else did they say no to?  Uh, Steve had brought a stapler.  God, we work for a weird company.  It's like you can't use, you can't use, you can't use glue traps, but you could, uh.  Get stung in the balls by bees repeatedly over and over again.  That's okay, but I can't put my sack on a fucking glue trap. 
[01:06:00]  Are your balls pretty tough?  Are you, like, when you guys bang chicks, are you into a girl, like, twisting your balls and stuff like that?  Occasionally, yeah, why not?  All right, Steve, these guys, he.  Are you married?  Girlfriend?  What does she think?  Engaged.  What does she think?  Uh, she thinks I'm a fucking lunatic.  Yeah.  Is that her right there?  But that's okay.  Yeah.  All right, but.  So what are you going to do to your, uh, nut sack?  You're going to do the, the spatula?  The spatula, the mousetrap.  Let's bring all the bees out.  I'm ready for the ultimate challenge.  Yeah.  Um, I was thinking about possibly dry shaving my sack. 
[01:06:30]  And then, if you guys had Icy Hot, we could apply Icy Hot.  Oh!  Another, another brilliant scheme I thought of, along with Steve representing Connecticut  over here.  Steve, you're a Connecticut kid, too?  Yes, I am.  You know each other?  No.  Oh, okay.  Different ends of Connecticut.  Yeah.  Uh, my, uh, my, my brilliant idea was for us to remove our shoelaces and make one long  string and tie it around my hog and his hog and possibly have Jimmy karate chop it. 
[01:07:00]  Now, we didn't talk to them out there.  I don't know if the lawyers know about it or whatnot.  I'll tell you why I wouldn't do that.  I would think, yeah.  That's going to be fun.  Yes, Jimmy?  I'm afraid of a karate chop, but someone's cock helmet will be ripped off.  And then I feel like a silly goose.  I think, uh.  It bounces off the floor, ends up in your mouth.  If they did want to do that, a shoelace or a string or whatever between the testicles  with a line in the middle and have a tug of testicles.  And let's do it.  Where, where you each then pull and the first one to pull the other one over the line with 
[01:07:30]  your balls, uh, wins.  Let's do a tug of testicles.  We got to, we got to, we got to, let the lawyers know.  We got to fill out new paperwork then maybe, but let's do it.  Yeah, let's do tug of testicles.  Tug of testicles.  Nobody wins.  Hey, wait, is your, uh, fiance here?  She's right outside.  Actually, I wanted her to.  Could she be the official blower?  Because we need someone to blow into the air, too.  Well, he has his girl with him, too.  Oh, perfect.  Perfect.  We got two blowers.  We'll be blowing.  Boy, that takes the gayness right out of this, doesn't it?  That's right.  Yeah, sure.  I was kind of, uh.  All right, what else you guys got?  The tug of testicles we like. 
[01:08:00]  Steve, what are you going to do?  They shot down my staple gun.  I was going to do the old Steve-O impression.  Staple my nutsack to my leg, but the lawyer said no.  Why?  I don't even know, because I thought you guys were on XM.  I mean, I thought we could do anything.  Well, they do have their, uh.  What's wrong with the staple gun, uh, to the leg?  I don't know.  Mutilation, maybe.  It comes under the heading of mutilation.  I'm guessing.  I don't know.  Oh, they got to let that through.  I agree.  And they were small staples.  I mean, they were only, uh, quarter inch, six millimeter.  Not major.  Ah.  So what are you going to do to your nutsack?  I'm going to make a cup of tea. 
[01:08:30]  I'm going to teabag a cup of hot water.  Wow.  That machine gets really hot, too.  Of course it does.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  That's, uh, that's his special trick.  Where's the, uh, third guy?  Where's Matt?  He's almost done.  He's still doing paper.  Wow, the paperwork.  Holy shit.  This guy's gone here almost an hour ago.  Video confessions.  Yeah.  These guys are fucking fearless, man.  Unbelievable.  I'm watching them both talk about the things they're going to do to their testicles very casually.  And if I was either one of you, I'd be very psyched out by the other, but neither one of you are. 
[01:09:00]  You're both like, yeah.  No.  Let's do it.  No.  I'm ready to whip it out right now.  Let's get something in here.  Let's start this.  Fuck it.  All right.  Let me get a mousetrap.  Come on.  Usually there's a lot of excitement in the studio, but, uh, we can wait on that.  Rubber bands?  Yeah.  Lovely to the testicles.  What, you're going to snap like that?  Oh, he's snapping rubber bands.  Oh.  Like that.  All right.  I one time had a dominatrix, and I'm not into ball torture, but she squeezed my balls a little bit, a little tougher than I like it. 
[01:09:30]  And for a second, I was like, ah, that was kind of hot.  So I can understand liking a little bit of pressure, like, to your balls.  No.  When you're banging, do you want them squeezed?  Twisted.  Twisted.  Like, I wanted to bring the vice grips, and, like, one of the listeners called in earlier this week and mentioned, you know, I go one full rotation.  Slowly, tight.  I mean, keep going.  This guy's the real deal, by the way.  Yeah.  You can tell.  I'll do it, man.  I'm not here to play games.  This is high voltage.  I don't know much about Steve, but Raphael, you're definitely the real deal.  Raphael's got his game balls on. 
[01:10:00]  Definitely.  You can tell.  All right.  Is Matt ready to come in here?  Can we at least talk to him?  He's getting his blood pressure and everything finalized.  How'd you guys do on your blood pressure?  Pretty good.  Yeah, yeah.  Low, high, what?  Normal.  Normal.  Yeah.  All right.  Who said no to this, Steve?  DC.  DC just called and said no to the testicle tug-o-war.  Oh, why?  Now they're just shooting down anything new. 
[01:10:30]  Now they're getting scared.  Anything new.  Now they're getting scared.  We had faith in them down there.  Tug-o-testicles, Opie.  What an event.  What an event.  Do you think that the lawyers, when they got involved with a satellite radio, and they're  worried about FCC things, ever thought they'd have to decide, should we let two men tie  something to their balls and back up in opposite directions?  You know when you're playing, when you're doing regular tug-of-war, there's like mud in the middle?  Yeah.  It would have been nice to get a gay guy or something waiting in the middle. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  An open asshole in between the two.  Oh.  Oh, God.  All right.  No tug-o-testicle.  No tug-o-testicle.  Who's bummed?  Great idea.  I am, too.  I think we're all bummed.  XM shot down anything electronic or electrical.  That's kind of a bummer also.  I mean, electric mousetrap.  Well, the ultimate-  Car battery.  Come on.  Car battery.  Jesus.  The ultimate challenge, though.  The bees.  Are you guys worried a little about the bees?  Those bees look like little faggots in the jar.  Wow.  Bring them on. 
[01:11:30]  Little faggots in the jar, he says.  He said, bring them on.  Oh, look at this guy.  He's got a robe and everything.  Matt.  Wow.  Look at him.  Matt.  Look, he's a tough guy.  Matt's a problem.  Matt is a problem.  He's wearing a championship belt.  He's got the championship belt on and everything.  How's it going, boys?  What's up, Matt?  Wow.  How's it going?  Matt, you are dressed for action.  You're ready to go.  Matt doesn't even have to be here today because he's legendary already.  That mousetrap video is being downloaded everywhere now.  Everywhere.  It's amazing.  What the hell belt is that? 
[01:12:00]  The balls of steel championship.  It's the balls of steel championship belt he's wearing.  Wow, guys.  That's got to intimidate you a bit.  No, huh?  No?  Nothing?  We'll see.  All right, Matt.  What did you bring in?  I brought a lot of stuff in, but it didn't get cleared.  What didn't get cleared?  Rat Trap.  Yeah, Rat Trap.  You were going to do the Rat Trap to the balls?  Yeah, I was going to.  I brought a vise in.  It didn't get cleared.  No vise.  Like, sort of like clothespins, but a lot heavier.  Tighter.  Not cleared.  No?  No. 
[01:12:30]  Clamps.  Yeah.  What are they afraid of, crush trauma?  What the hell?  Bengay got cleared.  I got wax.  Strips.  Oh, so you're going to wax your nut sack and then slap Bengay on.  Yeah, it's like glue traps.  Glue traps I brought in, they didn't allow that.  All right.  But waxing your nut sack, you can do.  That's got to be brutal.  That could be a nice.  Wow.  That, okay.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Waxing the nut sack and then putting Bengay on it.  Bengay, yep.  I got Bengay also.  Ew, that's got to hurt.  How about, all right, now we've got to organize.  What we should do is come up with a list of events they have to do. 
[01:13:00]  I'm thinking the wax strips first.  Yeah.  They all have to do a wax strip and then immediately apply some Icy Hot.  Yeah.  And then how about what else?  Bengay was shot down.  What else did you bring in, Matt?  But we're using Ben Producer.  I have a weird question about the Bengay.  Yes.  Will that prevent the bees from going on it?  Will that freak the bees out?  Wow.  Good question.  Don't want to sabotage the grand finale.  That might fuck the bees up, dude. 
[01:13:30]  They may get sick.  It might be like, off.  I think it's going to make them just go nuts.  Well, they wouldn't have to go in between rounds and wash their balls.  Like, the bees may stay away from the sack.  Yeah.  It may be a repellent.  It's just something to think of.  Oh, my God.  But we need the Icy Hot after they do the wax strips.  That would be very uncomfortable.  All right.  So we start with wax strips.  What else did you bring in, Matt?  Bengay.  All right.  So I'm thinking, help me out, guys.  Also, regular mousetraps.  I brought about six of those in.  I think they all have to do a mousetrap to the scrotum. 
[01:14:00]  Do we start with that?  Yeah, that seems to be it.  Technically, somebody already did one.  I'm not going to mention any names.  All right.  So we can do that.  All right.  So we're going to start with a mousetrap.  They all have to do a mousetrap to the scrotum to start the competition.  Right.  Then I'm thinking wax strips.  Is that good?  Yeah.  All right.  Wax.  Cup of tea.  Huh?  Cup of tea next.  Well, then that'll be the freestyle.  Yeah.  That's the team competition.  Yeah.  And then we get freestyle.  Then we got freestyle.  So.  Where you each get to show your individual talents.  I'm thinking mousetrap, wax strips, Bengay after the wax strips. 
[01:14:30]  If that fucks up the bees, we'll wash them, you know, we'll have them wash up and stuff.  I know.  Trust me.  I stopped myself.  We'll wash your balls.  No, I did not say that.  Now they're going to use you saying that.  We have to fight over who washes who.  Yeah.  I like Raphael.  So then it's the Bengay.  Okay.  Any other, any other, are we doing piercings or any of that crap today?  I don't, I don't think so.  All right.  I said no punctures though.  Okay.  Yeah.  No punctures seems to be the rule of the day, except if it's, you know, a beast 
[01:15:00]  stinger.  Right.  Okay.  So what else can we do?  We got mousetrap, wax strips, Bengay.  What about that slap thing and the rubber band?  Well, that, I think that's his freestyle.  That's his freestyle.  You're going to do the spatula, right?  Yes.  All right.  So I guess we do one, two, three, freestyle, and then the ultimate challenge.  I think we're pretty good.  Very good.  Mousetrap on sack only, no nuts.  Jesus.  Well, we know that.  These nuts are coming in like crazy.  We know that.  There's a lot of panicky Pete's. 
[01:15:30]  We've done the mousetrap before.  We know.  Do you realize that somebody spent all those years in law school and has to say, should  we allow the mousetrap to close on the ball itself?  And they're going on just the skin, just the skin and possibly the vein.  I went to school for 12 years.  I know that that's as far as we should go.  Wow.  500 people in the talk right now looking for this.  Than, if you could slowly, because if you move it quickly, it fucks up.  Grab that camera from up there.  500 people?  Yeah, we're going to set up the PalTalk camera. 
[01:16:00]  We're going to put it in a better position.  We got a two-camera shoot happening in the studio, so we'll have video up online.  Yeah, lots of video.  So are we done?  Are we not?  Is there anything else that we're not thinking of?  No, then we got to go freestyle.  So, Raphael, you're doing what's called what?  The Chomper.  The Chomper.  All right.  He's doing the Chomper.  Anthony's setting up the camera.  All right.  Steve, what's your freestyle bit?  I'm making a cup of tea with my nuts. 
[01:16:30]  That's right, Steve.  Cup of tea with nuts?  Cup of tea?  Oh, boy.  I don't know what my freestyle is.  All my stuff is taken now.  With nuts?  Yeah, that's a problem.  What could Matt do?  He can go sit in the corner while the big boys play.  Oh, the smack talk.  Or the sack talk.  This guy has to prove he can take one first.  I already took it. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, Matt might not have to do freestyle because he's the one that came in here already.  We'll figure something out for Matt in New York City.  I'm sure Matt could find something to rip off from one of us.  Oh, I love the smack talk going on here.  Uh-oh.  Love the smack talk.  Well, we can brainstorm.  We can figure something out.  By the time we get to Matt, maybe we'll have something.  How about Jeff to let Master Poe kick you in the balls a few times?  I think he wants to.  I think he wants to.  I think he wants to.  Yeah.  Over the room.  How about Matt has to drink a cup of my cum? 
[01:17:30]  Oh, my God.  That raises this to a fucking different competition.  This really is.  Sexiest.  I was going to say, it just got hot.  A cup of my cum.  Well, this is the real deal, though.  Raphael is really pissed off that Matt stole his tuner.  He's a problem.  No, Matt Puerto Rican.  No, I know.  No.  As soon as you walked in, I realized I might have judgment error.  All right, let's go to Pat in Boston.  Pat.  Grr.  Hey, I just want to know if these guys did any pregame.  Did they get a bunch of loads out? 
[01:18:00]  Are they holding loads in for three days?  What's the story?  Yeah, what was the pregame all about?  How about you guys ejaculate or did you save it?  I broke my finger so I can feel the pain.  He did break his finger.  How did you break your finger?  That actually worked.  Oh, okay.  What kind of work do you do?  Construction.  Okay.  All right.  I guess we're ready.  Yeah, absolutely.  Should we take a break and then set up the studio and we'll be ready to go?  And the festivities will start.  Do we have some dramatic music and all that?  Super Bowl Thursday.  I think we need some of that NFL music or something. 
[01:18:30]  Yes, maybe some ACDC.  All right, we'll figure something out after the break.  It's Super Bowl Thursday.  Yes.  And it's going to get crazy in here.  The EMT guys are in here and they're ready to.  Ready to jump in if they have to.  What about the bees?  Have they been transported to the apparatus?  Yeah, how is that going?  We'll do it now.  Where are we going to do this?  Right in that little studio right there.  Right in this studio, huh?  Mr. Fancy Pants.  I see you doing it over there by O.P. 
[01:19:00]  Why not?  He's got a suit.  Why not?  O.P., you do it.  Pick them out by hand and just throw them in the tube.  Yeah.  You laugh at bees.  I do laugh at bees.  Where are the faggots?  Yeah.  What are you doing without your hat on?  I don't know.  The bees aren't going to come out until fucking...  You think I don't know this radio show?  It's fucking 930.  Bees will be brought out at 1056.  Why would I wear that?  It's uncomfortable when the bees are coming out.  No, you just want to look good until you have to.  Yeah, the girls on Pal Talk want to see me.  The complaints were flying in.  Just like the NFL where they take off their helmets to look good on the sideline. 
[01:19:30]  That's what Jimmy's doing right now.  No, this is staying on.  No, it bothers my head.  It itches.  Like, the ear thing gets pressed down with the hat.  I don't like it.  Sorry.  That's all right.  Fuzzy Numkin calling again.  Fuzzy!  Yo, what up, boys?  What's up?  Yo, you got the sequence all wrong.  Check it out.  All right.  First, you got to slap the mousetrap.  Yeah.  Then you got to do the wax.  Yeah.  Then they'll be, like, nice and fresh and red and open.  Then you got to do the bees.  Then to top it off, you hit it with the Bengay. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, but then that messes up the ultimate challenge.  Yeah.  Well.  It has to end with the bees.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then the ante gets up.  The ultimate challenge becomes, can you get the Bengay on your balls after the bee sting?  I thought of that, too, but not for the same reason you're thinking.  I thought of it because if the bee, will it deter the bees from sting?  Because we've already seen Nathaniel took it.  I don't think it will, though.  I mean, if it did, people would be saying, hey, Bengay keeps bees away.  Well, no one's probably ever been put in that position where they put Bengay, like, how  many old people are outside and getting stung? 
[01:20:30]  They put old people get stung all the time.  You'd love to see that.  Ergh!  Ergh!  Just bees all over them.  Right on his joints where that fucking Bengay is.  Arthritis.  Yeah.  I can feel even worse.  But nothing happens because they got the leather skin.  Ergh!  The stingers are just breaking in half.  They're not penetrating anything.  All right, Fuzzy.  Thanks, brothers.  All right.  No, we've got to do the bees last.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm a little concerned like Jimmy is, but it has to be last.  Okay. 
[01:21:00]  I think it'll be all right.  Like we said, we'll be more than happy to go in and wash your balls for you.  I think it'll be okay, too.  After that, Jimmy will get in and lather them up real good.  Why does it we and then Jimmy will get in and lather them up?  Well, because I hope he's got to dry them.  And I got the bee suit on.  I can't do shit.  All right.  These guys will wax like one side of their ball bag so the other side is ready for the beast.  This is the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.  Sirius XM.

Trojan Man.  Okay, which one should we use? 
[01:25:00]  Well, I like Trojan Ecstasy condoms because they feel like there's nothing there.  Nothing there.  Oh, what about Trojan Charged?  An intensified experience from beginning to end.  Intensified.  I might like to try one of these multi-speed vibrating rings.  Lucky Man.  A variety of stimulating products for a variety of pleasures.  All triple tested for quality.  All from Trojan.  America's number one most trusted condom brand.  Trusted brand.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that smell? 
[01:25:30]  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  All right.  We're just about ready.  We've just been informed that Bill the Intern has to transport the bees.  Not yet.  From the jars and containers into the homemade apparatuses that Keith the Cop made.  This is going to be like transporting plutonium.  With drunks.  With drunks.  Let me set the scene.  Is the camera set?  Because Pal Talk, there's so many people in the Pal Talk room right now. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, a lot.  It's the most people we've had in Pal Talk since starting the Pal Talk phenomenon.  Record so far, over 500 people tuned in.  To check this out.  A lot more probably will be downloading it later because people post these video clips up on the web.  And, yeah.  Where do they post these clips, by the way?  They're all over.  On people's personal websites.  There's secret sites.  Through Wackbag or no?  Yeah.  Through Wackbag.com. 
[01:26:30]  Okay.  Because there's a lot of people that don't have the Pal Talk and they're going to want to see video immediately.  He's doing that in here?  He has to do it in here.  He has to do it in here.  According to the lawyers.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, here's the deal.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let me just set this up as Jimmy panics and tries to get his bee suit back on.  There's hundreds of bees in these containers.  We have to open up that lid and try to get a few into these apparatuses.  I don't see how we're going to do this.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll do it.  Fun on me.  We're going to fun.  Oh, my God.  This is a disaster waiting to happen.  Jimmy didn't hear.  Jimmy, here's the problem. 
[01:27:00]  A couple of our guys are allergic to bees.  They have to stay in the production room.  Hold on.  No bees can be exposed outside of this studio because then when they go walk out, if a bee  got away and stung them, there would be a problem.  Yeah, they're in a sealed studio over there.  The ones that are allergic to the bees.  All the bees have to stay in this studio if any get loose.  Huh?  Which guys?  Danny's allergic and Travis is allergic.  Travis is something I can put right there.  Travis is not.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, your hands, Jimmy. 
[01:27:30]  I know.  I'm waiting for this.  Hold on.  Got my ankles.  Oh, my God.  This is just not going to work.  All right.  Is the camera set up nice?  I am so glad I am dressed like this now.  Holy crap.  Those fucking bees are all riled up, too, boy.  They are pissed.  They just woke the fuck up.  How are you guys going to do this?  Have you ever done this before?  No.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  This is uncharted territory.  They haven't tested this funnel method, either.  Yeah, because things with wings go right down funnels. 
[01:28:00]  Another first ropey Anthony, by the way.  There's a chance of them flying out.  This is another first ropey Anthony, by the way.  Am I zipped up right up to the end?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, you got to zip the middle up, Ant.  What the fuck are you doing?  Jimmy, don't fuck with me.  I'll kill you.  Oh, shit.  What are you, nuts?  He just smashed them bees in there.  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Done?  Wow, it worked.  No one was looking and he just did it.  That's safe.  You did it perfectly.  There's fucking 80 bees. 
[01:28:30]  More, man.  Dude, we didn't want 80 bees in one apparatus, though.  We have to spread out the bees or are they going to use the same thing?  They're going to have to use the same apparatus.  They look friendly.  What?  There's some more bees here.  And he has one.  Yeah, there's plenty of bees left.  I got to say, but it worked the first time.  Why are we taking a chance?  It's going to work twice, Opie.  Have faith in the man.  I was going to tell you, ready, set, go.  I have some dramatic confidence in this guy's ability to transfer these bees.  Can I say those bees looked sleepy before, but boy, they're fucking wide awake now. 
[01:29:00]  They're starting to fly around in that pissed off bee-like way they do.  Yeah.  How would you feel?  Ah!  All right, he's transferring the other bees.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  They're in there.  Nope, this one isn't going as smoothly.  That's a fucking honeybee.  Why don't you guys act like men?  Oh, my God, I stopped breathing.  Act like men, the guy in the condom.  I stopped breathing.  All right, we got two apparatuses that are fully loaded.  Oh, now I got a feeling like one's on me.  Get off of me.  Fully loaded.  Yeah, no, I'm like...  All right.  Wow, they are pissed in that one, man. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, now they're all pissed off.  Those fuckers woke up.  They were sleeping for the winter, and now they got fucking...  They're in an apparatus with balls ready to be put in.  How would you feel?  They're unpleasantly...  All right, guys.  This is what's going to happen.  Man, so we got to figure this out.  We got to figure this out step by step.  Ant, when they start getting stung, they're going to freak out and drop the apparatus,  and then all hell's going to break loose in the studio.  And I will laugh and laugh and laugh.  This is on the B.  What do you got?  A B.  I caught one by the wings. 
[01:30:00]  He's ready to sting, so if you want to...  What the hell happened by the wings?  What do you want us to do with it?  You're a fucking insane person.  Don't let him go.  He's holding him by his wings right now.  I'll put him back in here.  Yeah, put him back in.  Talk to him later.  Let's see how he feels about...  Oof.  Let me ask, can you hear them buzzing there, or no?  No.  The bees are in a soundproof booth, so they don't hear the answers.  Can they breathe in there, by the way?  Oh, boy.  Does it matter?  How much air do they breathe, really? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, yeah, we don't need them all...  There's plenty in there.  Imagine as soon as they...  If I was one of these guys, I'd just wait for them to suffocate.  Put your balls in when they're all fucking just not moving.  All right.  I'd play dead.  By the way, we didn't even promote this, but Tracy Morgan's here.  Just to make this even better.  All right.  Get your suit for Tracy.  Yeah, bring up...  Tracy Morgan is getting his bee suit on.  Oh, Tracy Morgan's putting a bee suit on?  And he'll be joining the festivities.  Tracy Morgan rocks.  We met him a few years back at our celebrity softball game.  Yeah.  And he's been a friend ever since. 
[01:31:00]  He is putting a bee suit on.  Oh, this guy is a real trooper, man.  Remember, he went out to the pitching mound in front of 6,000 people in just a jockstrap?  In a jockstrap, and then he jumped in the pool.  We had little kiddie pools with strippers in them.  Yeah.  And he jumped in and bathed with these strippers.  All right.  This guy will do anything.  All right.  Now we're just waiting for Tracy Morgan to get the bee suit on, and then we'll get this going.  So the bees are in the apparatus.  And they're pissed off.  You know something?  They really came alive, these bees, because they were kind of lethargic in the plastic containers.  Yeah.  But when they're in the apparatus now, I think they sense soon testicles will be joining them 
[01:31:30]  in there, and they're angry.  Where's the guy that's got the spray that kills him?  He's outside.  Oh, that's brilliant to have him out there.  Have you noticed all the protection is for outside of this studio?  Like, there's nothing going on in here?  They don't want a bee getting out of this, uh...  Yeah, give me that spray.  Compartment.  Because I don't have a bee suit on it.  At least give me the spray. 
[01:32:00]  That's good.  Just don't spray us.  I'll spray whatever I have to.  Don't spray all willy-nilly.  Don't open the door.  You'll flood the whole compartment.  He's dead already.  Don't get it on your skin?  Really?  Why?  What happens?  Because it's a fucking poison.  Oh, okay.  How about giving a guy...  Can you have a fucking magazine rolled up if a bee comes in?  Don't spray chemical poison.  Oh, wow.  He's like the...  You like the low-tech version?  Yeah, better than chemical poison.  Kind of smack him.  All right. 
[01:32:30]  Tracy Morgan's just about ready to enter the studio.  Is he...  He's close.  He's close?  Okay.  We have so many people in the studio.  EMT guys, you ready?  All set.  They got their gloves on and everything, Anthony.  Yep.  All ready to go.  How do we decide who goes first?  Holy shit, they look angry.  Huh?  I don't know.  Put a coin.  Raphael wants to go first.  Who wants to go second?  Steve?  I'll go second.  All right.  And Matt's kind of like the champion here of what we don't know.  Chump win. 
[01:33:00]  We should have him do it.  We're getting another camera in here to film this?  We have one.  We should get a two-camera shoot going.  Yeah, there are video cameras going, so what you miss or don't get a really good view of on PalTalk,  you could download later in beautiful digital quality.  Yeah, we should get two cameras going just in case.  At that rapid, fast, high-quality video that you can get off of foundrymusic.com.  Yes.  Bandwidth like a thread.  All right.  God. 
[01:33:30]  Can you compress the files anymore?  That's great.  What was this?  I can't tell.  There's only three pixels.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tracy Morgan!  There he is.  In his B-suit.  Bro, bros.  Bro, bros.  What up?  Tracy.  What are we doing in here, man?  This is crazy, man.  He's got his Yankee cap on.  This is crazy, man.  What's up, Tracy?  So dudes are getting, like, stung on the nuts?  Yeah, maybe we should have told you ahead of time what was going on today.  This is so cool, man.  I can't even get a chick to teabag me and y'all letting bees sting you on the nuts. 
[01:34:00]  Look at these.  Don't open those things.  Yeah, look at that.  You see the angry bees in there, Tracy?  Look at that.  They're pissed off, right?  Oh, man, are they pissed.  Dude.  Are you for kidding?  They are pissed off.  They are the Africanized killer bees.  Are you serious?  As opposed to the pussy cracker bee.  Yeah.  That's what they call the ones raised here.  They're going to open up that part, shove their nuts in, and then we're going to release  the bees from that compartment to that compartment.  Who's gay?  These three lunatics.  Wow.  This has never been done on radio before.  Dude's crazy. 
[01:34:30]  No, it's never been done on the planet.  It's super cool, man.  On radio, really.  And we are here to witness this.  Yeah.  This is why this is the greatest show on earth right here.  In the safety of our bee suits.  You guys are the best.  How did you get gloves?  You brought those yourself, huh?  Yeah.  God damn it.  I wish I had gloves.  I got to go around like this.  I know.  I feel silly.  I feel scared.  They gave this to me out there.  They said, you want to go in?  I said, yeah, I got to be here for this.  Well, I want to introduce you to these guys.  That's Raphael.  Raise your hand or something.  There's Raphael. 
[01:35:00]  There's Steve.  What's up, bro?  And that's Matt.  He's the champion.  Well, it all started with...  It's a long story, but...  These things?  No, this is great, actually.  Raphael called our show one day and said, hey, guys, I want to take a mousetrap to the  nutsack.  Because we were doing it when we were bombing with our jokes.  We were taking mousetraps to our hands.  So he goes, fuck that.  I'll take one to the nutsack.  This guy came up with it.  He goes, I could be in tomorrow.  That was sometime last week.  Matt goes, fuck that.  I'm in New York City.  I'll be there in an hour.  So he stole this kid's thunder.  Yeah.  So Raphael really pissed off. 
[01:35:30]  And now we have this competition called Super Bowl.  It is going down.  It's going down now.  It is going down in here.  And you're on a camera, by the way.  We're doing a whole pal talk thing.  There's a ton of people with their webcams checking us out right now.  Right on.  And they're just staring at you and your bee outfit.  How do you feel, man?  How do you guys feel about this, man?  Just do it.  Any thoughts?  There's like one bee in there waiting for your ass.  They are so pissed.  I can't believe how much they've come alive, these bees.  One thing I want to know.  There are two apparatus and three guys. 
[01:36:00]  What's the difference with these guys?  Those are the ones that didn't quite make it into the apparatus.  Yeah.  They kind of got loose and we were able to catch them.  I want to know who.  There are two guys, three guys and two apparatus.  Who's going to get sloppy seconds on the apparatus?  No way.  See, that seems to be the part that has these guys flustered.  I'll tell you what.  I'll take one of the jars, put some bees in there, throw some tape on it.  I'll throw my balls in the jar so all three of us can go at once.  Yeah.  What about the wasps?  I think there's a wasp in there somewhere. 
[01:36:30]  Where's the wasp at?  There's a whole combination of things in there.  They're fighting.  They're willing to.  These guys in here in case one of them have a heart attack or something?  Yeah.  Or in case me or Anthony do.  They need the.  They're EMT guys.  They need some of that shit so your throat don't close up if you're allergic.  They're right there.  There's a possibility that one of these dudes could die?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  Yeah!  Lock and roll, baby!  That seems to be the problem here.  You mean foam coming out the mouth and all of that shaking? 
[01:37:00]  The whole deal, man.  Yes, yes, yes!  Tracy gets it.  All right.  Why am I wearing these EMT gloves?  One of these dudes might die, man.  This is what a way to start the morning.  This is the real deal, Tracy.  Huh?  This is the real deal.  I know!  All right.  Really?  Yeah.  Anthony, I think we're ready.  I'm guessing, Jimmy.  I don't know shit.  Tracy, we came up with a couple things they have to do before the. . .  That's called the ultimate challenge, what you're looking at in front of you.  Okay.  I want to adjust the webcam.  Yep.  First of all, they've got to take a mousetrap to their nutsack. 
[01:37:30]  Go old school.  Where are the mousetraps?  Is it mousetraps or mice traps?  Mousetraps.  I think it's mousetraps.  Even though it doesn't. . .  Because each trap is for a mouse.  Traps is pluralized, not mouse.  Very good, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thanks, Jim.  All right.  The camera's now on the contestants.  Yep.  What's going to happen is, Anthony, you've got to, like, work the camera.  Like, where do you want them to stand when they're doing their thing?  Well, ideally, like it was last time, we got the best shot from where Jimmy is. 
[01:38:00]  But, you know, we've got more people in here, and Jimmy's here.  Can we move the camera just a little closer?  No, we've got no more slack left in the line.  Really?  We wouldn't get more than another inch or two closer, and that really won't make much of a difference.  Once you move the honeybees, the two remaining ones, out of the way, you just slide them over.  Well, you want to move Tracy over there, and then the guys where we were last time for this ant.  Tracy could just move over there for this part.  We could do that.  We could do that.  With these guys?  No, you'll be on that side. 
[01:38:30]  Let's just grab that mic, Tracy.  Okay.  Grab that mic.  All right.  Because we want a close-up for the folks at home.  Yeah.  Keep the bees off my latte.  All right.  Now, I guess where Bill is would be ground zero for this whole thing.  Yeah, where Bill is looks like the best shot right there.  All right.  Bill is setting up the mousetrap.  This is Super Bowl Thursday on the Opie and Anthony program.  Are they going all three at the same time or one at a time?  One at a time.  One at a time for this one.  One at a time.  All right. 
[01:39:00]  So, Raphael from Connecticut, he's stepping up to the mousetrap.  Raphael.  You know, you've got to move the ultimate challenge away, the apparatuses, just to get a better camera.  Yeah, the apparatus is a little in the way.  A little in the way.  We need help here, guys.  I can't broadcast and organize at the same time.  Choreograph this whole thing.  Oh, geez, he's putting them near me.  Ha!  I am getting the heebie-jeebies so bad looking at those things.  All right.  Mousetrap is set.  I think we can move the camera slightly closer, no?  No, we're pretty much. 
[01:39:30]  We're there.  All right.  That's as close as we can get it.  And we've got two cameras rolling just in case.  Two different angles.  Okay, here we go.  This is Raphael from Connecticut.  Hold on one second.  Can you zoom at all yet?  I think you have zoom power with the camera.  Yeah, digital zoom.  It stinks.  Just try it once.  No, it's good.  I think it's good because we've got a close-up for later on for opanathlete.com.  This is at least good enough for...  I did it once.  It's not bad.  All right, yeah.  Keep it like that.  All right, here we go.  Raphael, whenever you're ready.  Now, remember, here's how it's got to be done, Raphael.  You have to take your bag and stretch it out. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, Matt did this perfectly.  You stretch it out.  You stretch your bag out and make sure it's only your sack that is going to be whacked by that thing.  Make sure to push your testicles back so it's only bag skin that is being hit.  You don't want to hit a nut.  You just want sack skin.  This is pretty gay.  There's like 25 guys in here and one female.  Oh, come on.  Matt, go ahead and pull your sack out a little.  It's Tracy Morgan's here.  Let's see this shit go to hell.  Yeah, Tracy Morgan, man.  That ungazed the whole thing. 
[01:40:30]  All right, here we go.  Stop it.  He's got his sack out.  It's stretched out.  And here we go.  We're filming this for opanathlete.com.  Whenever you're ready, Raphael from Connecticut.  Goal!  Goal!  Goal!  Do another one.  Do another one.  Do another one.  Set it up.  Set it up.  Wow, he's ready for another.  Goal!  Ready for another, ladies and gentlemen.  Goal for two.  Set it up, Bill!  What a professional.  What a moment for sport.  I can't believe he's going for a second mousetrap, people.  Dude, don't even.  No one gives a shit about your junk. 
[01:41:00]  Woo!  Trust me.  Don't worry about it.  Wow.  We've got a second trap set and ready to go.  He's going for two.  Whoa!  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Misfire, misfire.  Okay, Raphael's still got the mousetrap.  Bill's trying to set the traps.  Bill's shaking.  What's the matter, Bill?  Raphael still has the mousetrap attached to his ball bag.  Of course he does.  And Bill is just having a real tough time reloading.  He's got the left side of his sack in a mousetrap, I believe.  And he's going to go for the right nut. 
[01:41:30]  He's a nut.  Now.  Here we go.  Here's a second one from Raphael.  A dual hit on the mousetrap.  We didn't see this coming, Anthony.  We're going for two.  No!  Son of a bitch.  Two mousetraps.  Oh, my God.  Raphael from Connecticut kicking off this competition in true professional style.  Unbelievable.  Two mousetraps.  No one saw that coming.  He's giving up my taint. 
[01:42:00]  Unbelievable.  What a kickoff.  What a kickoff to this Super Bowl.  Come on, another one.  Come on.  Give me another one.  Well, I've got to find some more skin.  I've got to find some more skin.  Where would you fit a third?  Show the webcam.  Show pal talk.  Go ahead, show him your arm.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Dude, you're brave.  He's loading up a third mousetrap.  All right, I've got a third mousetrap.  I'm handing over to Raphael.  You know, in the world of professional sports, it's moments like this, Opie.  The unexpected things that happen that show the true professionalism. 
[01:42:30]  That's what history makes it.  By the way, who's judging this?  Oh, judging?  What's the fucking judge?  Let him just do this.  But I mean, in the end.  Oh, in the end.  How do we pick a winner?  I have no fucking idea.  He is now trying to find more skin.  He's pulling at different parts of his bag.  I think on the left side, he's found a little more.  Perhaps you can squeeze it into the corner of the trap.  It's all ball, though.  Make sure you push that ball back.  No balls.  No ball.  Just get skin.  That's delicious skin.  There it is.  He found some skin.  He's going to have to go for the corner, I think. 
[01:43:00]  Not going to be able to dive straight forward into this one, Opie.  He's going to have to come in on the corner with his ball bag.  You want me to push this forward a little bit?  Hitting the detonator.  He was talking about your cock.  Hey, Jimmy, want to hold this to me?  Push this forward.  All right, here we go.  Rafael's going for a third mousetrap.  Come on, Rafael.  All right, let's shh.  Here he goes.  He's got balls, like, right there.  He's trying.  Watch that testicle.  Yeah, protect the testicles.  Here he goes.  Here we go, the third one. 
[01:43:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Three mousetraps on his ball!  Unbelievable!  Wow.  I wish I had more skin.  I'd keep going, but I'm sorry.  It is just a lack of scrotal skin, Opie, that is keeping him from putting even more traps on there.  I have not seen professionalism like this in sport in years.  This motherfucker should join the Marines or something, yo.  Anthony, it's kind of weird. 
[01:44:00]  I kind of like the pain, man.  Do you?  I like it, yeah.  Could you not look me in the eye like that when you say that?  It's almost like an offer.  Sitting there, my balls sagging it off.  All right.  Let's hear it for Rafael from Connecticut.  Rafael, what a kickoff on this Super Bowl 2006.  Wow, that is really going to be hard to beat.  Not only a mousetrap to the nutsack, but a second, and then a third mousetrap.  Right.  This is going to be hard to beat, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:44:30]  Other contestants, are you nervous by the initial kickoff here by Rafael?  Three mousetraps.  How do you compete?  I'm sure I have enough sack for four.  He believes four mousetraps.  Opie, this is something we didn't expect.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  Just being witness to this is fantastic.  It certainly is.  Tracy, any comments so far?  Man, I have no comment on this, man.  These dudes are super freaks, man.  This is unbelievable.  This is like watching Ali enlisting. 
[01:45:00]  This is like watching the 69 Mets in the World Series.  Again, it's like watching the Mets beat the Red Sox.  It's just a moment in sport that I'm going to say,  where were you when they snapped three, four mousetraps on their bag?  And I'm going to say, I have no idea I was drunk.  Unbelievable day for sport.  There's actually, I have a bet with one of the EMTs.  He said they won't make it through the mousetraps.  I'm like, dude, they're going to make it.  Oh, yeah.  This is nothing.  The EMTs were doubting one mousetrap, and we've seen three. 
[01:45:30]  We have four loaded mousetraps here.  You had better have a huge sack, my friend.  All right, now we got four traps.  We got Steve from Connecticut stepping up to the mousetraps.  Let me tell you something.  Listen, Steve has an advantage.  Raphael was uncharted territory with three mousetraps, Opie.  He can now look and see and pick and choose where he wants to snap that first trap,  allowing maybe more skin for the subsequent traps that will come.  I think going second, a very good strategy here. 
[01:46:00]  All right, here we go.  Steve is stepping up to the mousetraps.  Here he goes.  Not afraid.  And he's not shy to show everyone.  Not shy, not afraid.  Where's that first one going?  Look Opie in the face while you do that.  He's pulling as much yam bag over, exposing as much of the right side of his sack as he can.  He's starting on the right side, I believe, working right to left.  Right to left.  Here we go.  Here he goes.  Detonation number one.  Close to you, goose.  Oh, there it is.  He's got a mousetrap on the left side of his bag. 
[01:46:30]  He's pushing over.  Opie's not even taking a second.  Next trap, lining up.  He didn't even blink.  I do think he's going to be able to get two traps on that left side of his bag, leaving  the right side completely open for at least two more traps.  At least two more.  Here we go.  Steve from Connecticut going for the second mousetrap.  Fantastic.  Fucking Steve.  He's shaking.  Are you all right?  Yeah.  He's stepping up to the mousetrap.  One fell off.  I'll do it again.  No biggie.  Uh-oh.  It's the one who likes this.  Well, now, you know, maybe you should break out the rat traps. 
[01:47:00]  You will have to have four hanging in order to beat that three.  Yeah.  Here he goes, having a really tough time keeping that nut out of there and getting enough bag.  He is shaking.  He's all ball, this kid.  You know, right now, I believe he's probably wishing he just got out of a warm shower.  Well, you have that great Turkish taffy consistency to your yambag, which is perfect for this type  of a competition.  Oh, there it is.  Backhand.  On the left side, it is hanging. 
[01:47:30]  That must stay now.  That is, uh, the second one's coming up.  All right.  You know, the studio was a little chilly today, and that could inhibit the number of mousetraps  he gets in there.  But as he goes on, he's forming up there.  Number two.  Two traps on his yambag.  And now his, uh, the other side of his yambag completely exposed and open.  Ready for number three.  He's got plenty of room for another couple of mousetraps.  I love how these guys are shaking.  Mousetraps.  How's it feel so far, Steve?  It doesn't hurt at all.  Oh, this is bullshit.  Oh.  Wow.  You see, that's professional. 
[01:48:00]  That one had her.  God damn it.  That one had her.  Holy shit.  Fucking.  He's going for number four.  He's going for four.  He's going for four.  This is a record.  Yes.  Four.  Three was a record.  Anthony, one was a record.  Here he goes.  Number four.  My God.  This is just.  This will be a new record.  Oh, my God.  Opie.  Opie.  Four mousetraps are hanging from his yambag.  I've seen it all.  I've seen it all.  Where's the camera?  You know, I've seen some things in my day. 
[01:48:30]  There it is.  Right there.  Right there.  No, dude.  There's the camera right in front of you.  I'm trying to see if I can fit one more.  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  One more.  Let's see if we can do this.  I say go for it.  Opie, I've seen Nirvana in a small club.  That's nothing compared if he does five.  Five mousetraps.  Can you load that one?  Where do you think you're going to fit this one, sir?  Yeah, where?  Where?  How much skin do you have there?  Are you going underneath?  He's going way over to the right-hand side, pulling some bag from underneath up into the  right-hand side. 
[01:49:00]  My God, he's finding bag where there shouldn't be bad.  What are you?  Unbelievable.  What are you, Arabian?  He has found more bag.  Yeah, he certainly has.  I think he's pulling up loose taint skin.  All right, here we go.  Here he goes.  If he gets five traps.  Here we go.  Number five.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, one fell off, but he did have five.  No, no, it's not a fish.  All right, it's not a fish.  They're waving it off.  Come on!  You're saying he's waving it off. 
[01:49:30]  It wasn't a catch.  You're saying he didn't have possession.  It wasn't on long enough.  You never had complete control of the mousetrap.  Let's go.  Load it again.  Load it again, Bill.  Take those gloves off.  He never had complete control of the mousetrap with his scrotum.  How are the bees doing, by the way?  Are they still moving around?  They're probably watching, wondering where they fit into this.  No shame.  They're like, what are we going to do?  All right, we're going for five again.  Here's Steve from Connecticut.  It's Super Bowl Thursday.  And nose that forward a little.  There you go.  Here we go.  Number five.  Make sure it stays on.  Oh, he's shaking. 
[01:50:00]  You know, somebody just used to try to hold it in place.  Somebody hold it for me.  Somebody was holding it for me.  He'll just hold it.  Okay, fine.  Fuck it, then.  Just hold it there.  All right.  He's going for five.  Hold on.  Take your time.  Oh, there it is.  Five traps are on this guy's bag.  Unbelievable.  Wow.  Hey, wait.  What a great, this is going to be a ball bag that goes down in history.  That's enough to kill half a mouse baseball team.  We've got to go to Jim in Wisconsin.  Jim?  Yeah, there's a little controversy here. 
[01:50:30]  Somebody ought to check for some performance-enhancing drugs.  Have a nice day.  All right.  We will be checking for some type of steroids or performance-enhancing drugs.  You know, to see five mousetraps like that, sure, the crowd enjoys it.  The people love the competition.  But what is it telling the kids?  If they're using drugs and a normal person, you know, can't get any more than maybe two on there.  You're getting five.  I'm a little suspect here.  But I'm not going to ruin this fine day for sport by bringing up this, maybe an investigation later, maybe something. 
[01:51:00]  But right now, I'm just enjoying the competition, which is fantastic up until now.  It's anyone's game at this point.  Anyone's game.  Steve and Raphael, both very impressive.  When I think I was stunned at three traps, Obi, three traps, and this gentleman, five traps, no way to beat it.  I just don't see enough skin.  Hey, kids, don't try this at home.  Very good.  You are a role model.  You certainly are.  That's what I was going to say.  All right, Matt is stepping up.  Matt, comment, anything? 
[01:51:30]  Did we lose Tracy Morgan already?  Where did Tracy go?  He said he had enough, but he walked out.  He left us?  Yeah.  What?  Oh, he's over there?  Yeah.  What happened to Tracy?  Why is he outside?  Was he laughing hysterical at white guy cock?  Yeah.  Probably, yeah.  I know.  Black guys can get five on each side of the bag.  Interesting underwear you're wearing.  Yeah, nice fucking silk.  I guess maybe he doesn't want to get arrested, maybe. 
[01:52:00]  Maybe that's it.  Maybe he's got some things he's worried about.  Separating himself from.  All right, Matt.  Matt, what are you going to do to beat these guys?  I'll let my cock do the talking right now.  Do you think you could get more than five traps?  What's your cock going to say besides, ouch?  He's really searching for the proper skin placement now.  That seems to be very important.  Now it's all about the numbers.  All right, here we go.  So you can't just go into this and snap the trap. 
[01:52:30]  Here's Matt from New York City.  Oh, there's one.  Oh, Jesus, man.  That's got to hurt.  You're kidding me.  That has got to hurt.  Wow.  All right, he's going for number two, Anthony.  You want to move that a little closer, son?  Yeah, you can move the trap closer.  Don't be such a goose.  That's good.  Yeah, it's all you.  Any technique, any style.  Wow, he's stretching that out like a full mouthful.  Oh, he lost the mouse trap.  He lost the first mouse trap.  That's a tough one.  He'll get it back on. 
[01:53:00]  That one's got to go back on, sir.  Yeah, please.  All right.  Stop cheating.  He's going for number one again.  Oh, my God.  Oh, two traps sprung.  Well, that's just barely hanging from his sack.  It counts.  He has a broken hand.  He does have a broken hand, which, again, shows Opie the courage of the competitors here today.  Broken hand and all.  And that didn't stop him.  He's here for Super Bowl.  A real trooper.  There's number two.  There's two.  Again, he got that trap hand. 
[01:53:30]  He keeps getting his broken hand.  Yeah, he's got two on his yam bag.  But his finger hurts when he gets that slammed in there.  Figure that.  I don't know how this guy is wired.  But very good.  Like I said earlier, he's got a very good hubba-bubba, chewed hubba-bubba consistency to his yam bag,  which I think will really help him get those numbers up.  And here goes number three.  Matt from New York City.  Super Bowl Thursday.  He's out of camera range, by the way.  Yeah, I'll have to move that over a bit.  That's all right.  There you go.  There we go.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  He's got three hanging.  He's got three.  Three are hanging from his yam bag.  How's it feel, Matt?  Feels good.  He's digging it.  All right.  He's going for number four.  Number four is loaded and ready to go.  Oh, it hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  At least somebody owned up to it.  There you go.  It does hurt.  Oh, there's number four.  There's four.  He still has some skin left.  Good placement. 
[01:54:30]  Good strategy.  You know, some people just think this is about slapping your ball bag in a mousetrap and taking the pain, Opie.  But there is a true strategy here as to where you're placing these mousetraps on your yam bag.  And I see, as he goes for five, mousetrap number six loaded and lined up.  And I believe a very optimistic Bill is loading up trap number seven.  You're insane, Bill.  You're insane.  It ain't going to happen.  Not this year.  Matt from New York City going for the fifth mousetrap.  Hanging it way over the side. 
[01:55:00]  Wow, he is really hard to keep into a camera.  He's struggling.  Oh!  Moving side to side.  He's looking to see if he has room for six, Anthony.  Room for six.  Six would be a new world record.  This is something I have never seen before.  And I got to, you know, it's a moment I want to tell my grandchildren about.  Here he goes.  It's a moment they would love to tell their grandchildren about if they can have kids.  Attempting the world record.  He's actually reaching back and pulling asshole skin to the front. 
[01:55:30]  Here it is.  Oh!  A new world record!  A new record.  Six.  He's going for seven, Anthony.  He's going for seven.  No way!  No way!  Not seven!  And do I see mousetrap number eight waiting on deck?  There can't...  I refuse to believe this is even possible.  The only thing that's going to stop this kid is lack of skin.  That's all that's going to stop him.  Lack of skin.  The drive.  Here we go.  Number seven.  That's a tough spot he's picking over there.  Yeah.  Seventh mousetrap.  I don't know about this.  To the ball. 
[01:56:00]  I think he's going to have to go more for part of the upper penile skin and lower penile skin  and upper yambag skin.  It's still officially nutsack, but it's getting a little too close.  He's rifling through these like a janitor looking through his keys.  Yeah!  Number seven!  Oh, my God.  Wait, do we have one that fell?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  It's only six.  Still only six.  I thought we were seeing history in the making.  We still have a world record in front of us, Anthony.  Yes, we do.  Yes.  Oh, it snapped on Bill's hand. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  Like, that really hurts after watching this.  Have you found any open real estate, you think?  Matt?  He's just concentrating.  Matt?  Yes?  Another problem with this, Opie, is finding the skin.  You keep pulling thinner and thinner layers of skin out because so much is taken up by  the previous traps, which makes it even more painful.  All right.  Here we go.  Get it set.  Let's go.  Number seven.  Yeah, he's hurting.  Come on.  Stop taking your time, Bill.  Wait.  Wait.  Get on camera because this is for another world record.  Hold on a minute.  Stop IMing me, you motherfuckers! 
[01:57:00]  I can't see the goddamn camera.  What are they saying?  This is cool.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, Matt.  We're trying to get you on camera.  On Palto camera.  There it is.  Okay, you're on camera again.  He's been moving around like crazy.  Anyone IMs me, they get banned.  Here goes number seven.  Somebody hold the back of the trap.  Yeah, hold the back of the trap.  Yeah, hold it.  Please, Bill.  Bill, it's not gay.  Yeah, it's not at all.  Hold it with your chin.  It's not gay.  Yes, it is.  All right, he's going for seven.  Hold it.  Seven mouse traps.  No.  Oh, no. 
[01:57:30]  I don't think it's going to happen.  It ain't happening.  He said it, son.  But give him one more chance, Opie.  He got three attempts.  Give the kid another chance.  I think he got three attempts.  Someone's on the phone going, could you imagine if Ben played this game?  Yeah.  He's going for 47.  He'll never make it.  You know those containers you see on your way to Jersey?  The shipping containers?  You need one of those filled with mousetraps for Ben.  All right. 
[01:58:00]  All right, we're trying.  We'll give him one more shot at seven mousetraps.  Yeah, we're going to stop at seven.  This is the last shot he's going to get at this.  Right at the edge.  Right at the edge.  Bill, just hold the back of the trap for the guy so he can set his world record.  Yeah, Bill, pull a tag out.  But did they tell, you know, Bruce Jenner not to attempt the final part of his decision?  Oh!  Wait, is it official?  One fucking fell.  Oh, one fell.  That's it.  There is only six.  It's just a skin issue, but six is the record.  Sir, that is more than respectable. 
[01:58:30]  Six mousetraps are hanging from his yard bed.  Unbelievable day for this competition.  Let's go to the phones.  Larry in New Jersey.  Larry!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This is so painful.  That's why I'm the champion.  You're a gentleman in the skull.  And the worst part about it is I can't even, like, there's nothing even on shitty terrestrial radio to listen to otherwise.  Right.  I'm fucking, I have to listen to this pain.  While I'm driving to work with my legs crossed, I'm going to get an accident because I'm going to get my fucking foot off the brake here. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Jesus Christ.  We are up to about 650 people.  All right.  That are watching this competition now.  You know how it starts out like that.  By next year, Super Bowl, I'm sure we'll have millions of viewers around the world.  Millions of viewers.  As it is brought to network television.  And sponsorships, yes.  The ultimate challenge.  Crap's ESPN.  Oh, we are far from through, ladies and gentlemen.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.

[02:04:00]  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of O.P. and Anthony's Sirius XM.  Yeah, what's next?  We're running out of show.  We should move right on.  Right on to the wax?  The wax strips.  Wax strips.  These are wax strips used normally, I guess, to a bikini wax or girls get waxed with.  Mustache wax, ladies, anything?  All right.  Are there any Italian girls out there? 
[02:04:30]  Stop.  A lot of them do.  Oh, my God.  Is that sticky?  A lot of them do.  Is it?  Oh, my God, dude.  Yeah, that's going to hurt.  Fuck that.  Oh, I thought you were touching the wax strip and not Raphael's bag.  That is sticky.  It looks sticky.  Jimmy.  Hey, did we lose Tracy Morgan?  Yeah.  He didn't want to be part of this?  He just said, what?  He just tapped out.  He tapped out.  I can't believe it.  Tracy Morgan tapped out?  Why?  We can do this all at the same time.  Did he get a phone call?  He was mortified.  Why was he mortified?  He's a little too Hollywood these days, I think.  He's got people around him. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  He just didn't like looking at that guy's balls.  He said, come back tomorrow.  Do you think we enjoy this?  This is for the listeners.  That's right.  This is for sports.  We sacrifice for our fans.  Hey, Ben, who else is here?  You watch both.  Ari's here.  Ari's here?  I don't think some people take this sport seriously.  Yep, you're right.  They look at it like it's a game.  Like it's some kind of a joke instead of a true sport.  We're going to the celebrity bullpen, by the way.  We lost Tracy.  We had to take him out of the game.  We got Ari coming in from The Sopranos.  Ari! 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  I'm kind of scared to come in this room.  Yeah, it really is nasty.  That is something to watch.  Does it just reek like awful sex in here?  Yes.  It probably does.  Yes, it does.  It smells like a, ugh.  Wait a minute.  You're from Dog Sees God.  I'm from Dog Sees God.  I thought this thing was from The Sopranos.  You were on there?  I was also on The Sopranos.  What were you on The Sopranos?  Back in the day, I was Meadows College roommate.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  I pulled out my hair.  Remember the crazy girl?  I was crazy, yo.  Yeah.  That was actually a really good role on The Sopranos.  Not as crazy as these guys, but you know. 
[02:06:00]  Hey, I don't always wear this, by the way.  It looks very becoming on you.  You should wear it all the time.  It's not just something I come in with on Thursdays.  It looks good.  Thank you.  It looks really good.  All right, so what do you got to do to wax this off because we're running out?  Okay, so basically warm it up in hand, apply really firm, and I guess they're ripping it  off?  Yeah.  Okay, so I think all three of them should do it at the same time because we have enough  and time issues.  No, I think they want one at a time.  One at a time because you want to get the reaction.  We need reactions.  That's why you're still an intern, Bill.  That's right.  Are you offended by male nudity or anything like that? 
[02:06:30]  I love male nudity.  All right, very good.  Bring it on.  And Tracy Morgan doesn't, by the way.  And Ari is making it less gay, thank God.  Yes.  We need a female in here.  Finally, a lady is in here.  It is a little homoerotic in here.  It's a little homoerotic.  Yeah, a little.  I think it's...  Why add the word erotic?  It's just homo.  Yes.  Two men in beekeeper outfits with erections.  Do they look ridiculous, Ari?  No, it's good.  It's a look.  I got a little beekeeper hat for my head. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  We're running out of show.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, guys, now that there's a lady in here, you can't be shy.  You're going to have to slap that on there.  Yeah, come on.  Don't be fucking shy.  Just do it.  Raphael is up first.  Here goes Raphael from Connecticut.  He was very impressive in the mousetrap challenge, Anthony.  Wet chicken, NH, you're banned.  You're banned.  Goodbye.  What's he saying?  Bounce that person.  I am'd me.  Fine strips?  Interferes with my camera shot.  You're gone.  Goodbye. 
[02:07:30]  You missed the fun now.  I was like, what the fuck?  All right, guys, we're ready.  He's got the wax strip on his ball bag.  That's got to be tender and sore from the mousetraps.  It looks like a fruit roll-up.  All right, the wax strip is on.  This is going to be child's play, I think, for Raphael.  Oh, that's nothing.  Come on.  Bring the glue traps in.  I agree.  Jesus.  Come on.  Bring the glue traps in.  What?  Nothing?  I got to do it again, though.  What the fuck?  All right.  Maybe you're not doing it.  Do you have hairy balls? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very proud of them.  Yeah, hairy sticky balls now.  That's true.  After a fucking...  Yeah, this is nothing after the mousetraps.  Which is good.  It's sticky, so the bees will probably stick to them now as they try to escape.  All right, that ripped a little hair out.  Yeah, it took a little hair out.  That hurt.  This is child's play.  I'm disappointed.  I'm disappointed.  After all the mousetraps.  Look at this.  How many mousetraps did you fit?  On there.  He fit four.  Four.  I didn't strategically place him on my sack. 
[02:08:30]  I would like a recount, maybe.  The excuses come in.  He's blaming it on coaching.  You know, this is something we don't need in professional sport like this, is the excuses,  the blaming, the finger pointing.  All right, Steve is up next from Connecticut.  He's got the wax shirt.  Steve from Connecticut.  He's got some hairy bears.  He doesn't care.  He's got the head caught.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Did they get that on camera?  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, my God.  Ari, what do you think?  Holy.  This is the most horrifying thing I've ever seen.  Oh, did that look like it?  It hurt.  Explain that if you can.  It's worse than trying to pull Turkish taffy off of flypaper.  It stuck to it.  It was like an old fruit roll-up.  You know, on a hot summer day, you step on a piece of gum on the sidewalk, Anthony, and  you're pulling and pulling, and the gum is still on your shoe?  Wrap it in there.  I'll smash it on there real good.  Wait, here goes Matt.  Attempting the wax strip. 
[02:09:30]  He's got the back of the shaft in there.  Don't bend down, or then you're not going to see it on camera.  Lift it up from the back to the front.  Here we go.  Like that.  Here we go.  Yeah, here we go.  Here we go.  Ari, this is for you, Ari.  Hit it.  No, toward the camera.  Ow!  Ow!  Did you hear the rip?  Did you hear the rip?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Dude, hold on.  That hurt, right?  I fucking fallen.  Oh, wow.  He made it through.  The wax strips.  That hurt more than the mousetraps, Matt? 
[02:10:00]  Safe to say?  Yes.  Safe to say.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  All right, all the guys made it through the second stage of Super Bowl Thursday.  And remember, people at home, don't try this.  These are professionally trained athletes.  That's right.  That's right.  Trained for minutes to do this.  You guys aren't going to make me do anything like this.  Well, we're hoping, Ari.  We're hoping.  We only have.  Let me tell you something, Ari.  We only have one competition we've ever had the ladies do.  We haven't had it done in quite a while, and I really don't think you'd be up to it. 
[02:10:30]  It is called the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  See the Wiffle Ball Bat in that glass case up there?  It's protected in the glass case.  It's a special.  Say no more.  All right.  All I'll say is it's a special kind of lady that even tries to compete.  I'm sure that's true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Usually they're strippers or some type of porn star that goes for that.  You can see their notches and names at various points on the bat, which I think you can figure 
[02:11:00]  out why.  Sounds like a fantastic competition.  They weren't just drawing their names willy-nilly on that bat.  We want Ari to hang out a little longer, so let's...  Yes.  Now, are we done with the wax strips?  Yes.  Yeah, that was the wax strip segment.  Now, Icy Hot, applied right to where the wax strip pulled off whatever it pulled off.  Hair, meat, anything else.  This should be easy.  Yeah, they're going to laugh at this.  I can't believe you're still smiling.  Let me go to Robert in Dallas.  Robert?  Yeah, everyone's talking about how painful this seems, but it's so surreal, I can't even 
[02:11:30]  imagine it.  It doesn't even affect me.  I'll have to see the video or something.  You've got to see the video.  Definitely.  This is video that will...  It's the fucking worst thing you've ever seen.  It's like...  It looks like it hurts more than the Kennedy assassination.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, I had a quick suggestion.  Yeah.  I was thinking, how about a zipper to the ball sack?  Oh, zipper to the ball sack.  Oh, that's a lot.  That could be a problem.  Oh, boy.  No, I don't think we'll see that.  Oh, boy.  That could be a problem. 
[02:12:00]  That's enough.  Someone said that that last wax thing sounded like Velcro.  It was being ripped.  It really did make a nice carry.  It came through loud and clear, I believe.  Yes.  All right.  Here we go.  Fucking Gordon.  Drink a Starbucks.  Drink a Starbucks through his bee suit.  Bees moving still?  Oh, they are very active.  Don't shake them up.  Come on.  You know what's happening, Opie?  A lot of people in here, it's warmed up in the studio, and the bees are really coming  around now.  The bees are watching this fucking disgusted.  Oh, what are we going to do with the bees?  What are we going to do with the bees? 
[02:12:30]  All right.  That's the grand finale.  As you see this rubber top, what they will be doing is inserting their bag into the top  of that.  A gate will be open, and bees will be released into their...  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's the grand finale.  That's the grand finale, yes.  Wow.  Wait, what's wrong?  Why are you giggling?  Why is Raphael...  Problem?  My balls are really, really, really sticky.  They're sticking to your leg.  I can demonstrate on the counter over here. 
[02:13:00]  You're going to have to sanitize it.  That's good.  That's why I sit and eat every day.  Go ahead.  Stick your balls there, son.  Feel free.  Watch, watch.  Stick it to the table.  There you go.  Enjoy your eggs tomorrow morning, Jimmy.  My fucking sleeve will get stuck to the counter where his bag was.  Why is it sticky over here?  All right.  What are we doing?  Icy hot?  Yeah.  You did it already?  No, I didn't put it on yet.  No.  All right.  All right.  Icy hot right there.  We're going to have to keep moving along here.  This guy's going to laugh at icy hot.  Icy hot right where the... 
[02:13:30]  Now, how much do we put in our hands now?  Just the tip of your finger.  You don't have to lather them up really well.  We should load them up.  I mean, this is the ultimate.  You know what?  I say we bail on the icy hot and go right to the ultimate shot.  I agree.  Oh, my God.  Because you don't know how it's going to affect it.  Yeah.  Because I just don't see the icy hot being that impressive after what we just saw.  All right.  Where do you want?  These guys have shown themselves as true sport.  Hold on.  They do have freestyle.  Freestyle.  Let's bring in chomper.  Freestyle.  All right.  Yeah.  This guy, Raphael, has something called the chomper.  Where's the chomper?  I don't know.  It might be out there with the lawyers.  All right. 
[02:14:00]  Go get the chomper.  The lawyers.  Look at him mocking the lawyers.  And Steve, he wants to go freestyle and do a cup of tea.  He's going to make.  Yeah.  He's going to take hot water.  Now, they came up with these ideas.  We didn't.  Yeah.  He's going to take a hot cup of water and.  Here's the chomper.  Oh, my God.  That's going to hurt a lot.  All right.  That's called the chomper.  Do you know Master Poe could take out an army of 600 people with that thing?  You want Master Poe to do the chomper? 
[02:14:30]  No, no, no.  You're going to have your girlfriend?  No, no, no, no.  Is that your girlfriend?  Your fiancee, right?  Yes.  My fiancee, Jessica.  Hi, Jessica.  How are you?  You're a lucky lady.  Yeah.  Wow.  She gets to chomp my balls.  All right.  Here's freestyle.  Raphael from Connecticut is doing what's called the chomper.  It's a, what is that?  A plastic.  For pasta?  Yeah, a little pasta.  It's one of those pasta spoon things that you take it out and it's got like fork, thong.  It has a lot of claws.  Tines on it.  Yeah, a lot of claws on it.  Yeah, claws to hold the pasta in there.  Do you hit his balls with things at home?  Have you ever? 
[02:15:00]  First time.  First time for everything.  I hope she's not mad at you.  Can I hold on the cable?  Yeah.  Elevation.  Harder.  All right.  I don't think that's going to happen.  All right.  Here we go.  Go ahead.  I'm having a hard time spreading my sack open.  It's all stuck like fucking honeycomb.  That'll happen.  All right.  Here we go.  He's going to be fun.  He has released the ball bag again.  His fiancee has what's called the chomper.  That's what he says when his cock is there.  Don't hit my hand.  That's a nut right there. 
[02:15:30]  Hold on.  All right.  Yeah.  No nuts.  I might be able to stick my balls right to the counter and just lean back.  Whoa.  That's a nut.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, Jesus.  This is the chomper.  Oh, Jesus.  The chomper.  We're free.  It's live on Pal Talk right now.  People are checking this out at home.  It's a competitor's choice.  Freestyling.  Wait.  You're going to grab a ball.  Oh, she hit my fucking head.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He miscalculated.  No pain.  No gain.  And there was... 
[02:16:00]  She hit your helmet.  Lady again there.  She hit the helmet.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, he is in pain.  Matt's not happy.  What's wrong, Matt?  I'm trying to think of a freestyle thing.  Yeah, Matt's panicking because we added the freestyle part to the competition.  Yeah, the Whipple Ball Bat.  Whipple Ball Bat challenge.  All right.  Where's the hot steaming water there?  I don't know.  Where's the water?  Was this here?  For the tea competition?  Yeah.  The tea freestyle?  Do you believe they actually put a tea bag in there? 
[02:16:30]  Why?  Oh, why not?  Yeah.  You might as well not waste it.  Yeah.  Because he likes yellow tea.  What is it?  There it is.  How hot is it, Bill?  Oh, my God.  What's made?  You requested milk and sugar, too.  This seems almost worse than the chomper.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does.  Hold on.  Before we take it out.  How hot is this?  Oh, that's fucking hot.  It is a...  That's going to be a problem.  Gives a new meaning to teabagging.  All right.  I just want to be clear.  This is all just to get a radio.  Is that right?  I don't even know what they're getting. 
[02:17:00]  No, it's bragging rights.  It's pretty much bragging rights.  It's a guy thing.  It's not always about materialistic things.  Sometimes it's just about sitting in a bar and saying,  You know what I did?  We will find a radio.  We'll figure out some really good prizes for these guys.  I don't know.  All right.  Here's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's stretching.  Wow.  Oh, he's pulling them down.  Jesus.  Short move.  It's not a doorknob.  That's good.  That won't attract bees more.  Nice milk and sugar on your boy.  Yeah, really.  Here he goes.  And here he goes. 
[02:17:30]  Let him steep a bit.  Let him steep.  Let him steep a bit.  Dip it.  Dip it.  Dip it in there already, you goose.  Dip it.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Ew!  All right.  You don't have to drink the dance.  He dipped his balls in hot water and drank some.  Oh!  Lovely.  It's a lovely radio show.  Someone's saying,  I can't wait to see Web Junk 20 this week on BH1.  Oh!  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, Matt, anything? 
[02:18:00]  I'll do the Icy Hot, but...  I'll do the Icy Hot, but...  All right.  Don't worry.  I think it's time for the ultimate challenge.  Yeah.  I say so, too.  It's the worst thing for me, Anthony.  All right.  I guess we're ready for the ultimate challenge.  Yeah, I think so.  The problem is we only have two containers and three people.  I understand.  They're going to have to share.  So, yeah.  They shared mousetraps.  Yeah, you shared mousetraps.  It's not gay, believe me.  I think we should roll the dice or something to figure out who goes first.  Or something.  How about whoever...  Yeah.  Paper, rock, scissors, pulling straws. 
[02:18:30]  What?  What do you want to do?  Smallest cock.  How do you flip a coin with three people?  Who has the edge?  I think my belt speaks for itself that I should go last.  All right, Matt.  That's a good point.  Matt is the champion.  Well, they should flip a coin for who has to go in which one.  They're both pretty full, dude.  What do you want, 80 Bs or 74 on your balls?  Who cares?  The only problem is...  What problem?  I think we should open it up and get the Bs into the main container first just so...  Why?  Because this thing's hard to open the safety hatch.  They're doing it that way.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[02:19:00]  Here's the problem with that, though.  So, once the Bs are in there, if they have a problem getting their bag in there before  it gets sealed, there's going to be some loose Bs in here.  That's right, Bill.  It's going to be someone's responsibility to open that gate.  That's right.  I don't care what it takes.  Balls go in first.  Gate opens second.  Absolutely.  Good point, Andrew.  That's what happened at Chernobyl.  They open the gate first and put the balls in second.  Now, look.  They put your balls right in there.  Yeah.  Do you want to just have Raphael call heads or tails for who goes first here? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, let Raphael do it first.  Nathaniel.  What is it?  It's tails.  Tails it is.  So...  Fez!  Fez!  Fez!  From Ron and Fez, everyone.  I'm very surprised that you're in the studio.  Well, I got here a little early today.  Can I say, finally, great radio.  My God, this is what the country has been waiting for.  Super Bowl every single day is what I said.  Fez, we had girls coming in here doing the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge. 
[02:20:00]  Three of them were up on the console.  Really?  Where were you that day?  I don't recall that day.  But, yeah, I just happened to get in here early to do some paperwork over some things  with Black Girl.  Just great show, guys.  This is the best.  Why are you pulling up a chair, Fez?  Why can't we do this every day?  Don't you have show prep to do or something?  Oh, fuck that show.  All right, well... 
[02:20:30]  Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it.  Yeah, this is the best.  What's next?  What's coming up next here?  Well, we have the ultimate challenge.  This is the grand finale.  The apparatus full of bees.  The guys will be putting their balls in that hopefully airtight rubber top.  And then a gate will be open, releasing the bees into the chamber.  Yeah.  And then they have to sit there until one of them gets stung.  This was one of many prototypes we had to figure out in apparatus.  This is all Nazi technology. 
[02:21:00]  I know.  One prototype was Jimmy Norton's mouth.  And that didn't work out too well.  Yeah, I don't want bees.  He's afraid of bees.  I don't want bees in my mouth.  I'm glad we all had a laugh at my expense.  All right, here we go.  Well, I am now into the frightened portion of the show.  I've never had an anxiety attack.  I think I'm having one.  Yeah, this is a little much.  I'm getting a little freaked out now.  I understand why Tracy left.  Yeah, see?  But you're showing you have more balls than Tracy Morgan. 
[02:21:30]  This is not going to be that handled.  She's seeing more balls than Tracy Morgan.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  All right, now, how do we decide?  Is it who goes first or both at the same time?  I think, shouldn't it be both sequential?  Yeah, okay.  Okay, you're going first?  Raphael.  Raphael?  It's up to you, bro.  You look a little nervous now.  Wait, how do we get him up higher for the camera?  Can he stand on a box?  I'm not even kidding.  Well, the camera, can the camera be aimed?  No, because he's a little shorter, so we want to make sure we get this on camera. 
[02:22:00]  That's all.  If I was in better shape, he could stand on my back.  All right, we are adjusting the webcam.  That's good.  The apparatus filled with, how many bees are in there, seriously?  What do you guess?  Yeah, a shitload.  50?  About 50 bees.  That's fine.  They're not going to bother you.  Wait, and we need the camera where we see their faces, I think, too.  Yeah.  Raising it back up.  We could still proceed here.  You don't bother them, they won't bother you.  Yeah, we need to see their face. 
[02:22:30]  I might have to pull out, then.  Yeah, pull out a little, because we're getting video, as well, for the websites that will  be close-ups and all that crap.  We've got a two-camera shoot happening.  Bill, did you just say whichever way is most comfortable?  None.  Let's say whichever way is most comfortable.  Oh, wait, none way.  And we need a girl to blow into the tube.  I think they're pretty...  Into the phallic tube.  I don't think you need to.  Yeah, I think they're pretty angry.  Who's going to put their mouth by that tube?  Here we go, the ultimate challenge.  We've been waiting five years to do this on the radio.  Five years in the making.  We finally found lawyers were stupid enough to let us do this. 
[02:23:00]  Gentlemen, take your balls out.  All right, let's explain.  Finally.  Raphael has...  Sticky balls.  Sticky balls, yes.  Yeah, they're sticky from the previous competition, which was the wax strip.  You don't have to worry about your penis.  None of us are looking at it from where to the first step.  Please, don't worry about it.  I don't think my balls are going to fit in the asperatis.  Well, it better.  You're going to have to jam them in there somehow. 
[02:23:30]  Bill, push this ball in.  I'll fit.  Bill, open up the rubber.  Force them in there.  Be a man.  Open up the rubber and get them in there.  Jam it in.  All right, is it in there?  Yeah, it's sticking.  Who's looking?  Let your boss know who's boss.  Yeah, get the other side in.  Don't drop it, whatever you do.  Yeah, hold it, dude.  Don't drop it.  That'd be silly.  I don't think you've got enough sack in there.  Yeah, push more sack in there.  Push it up to the base of your, like, schlong.  Can someone get a picture of the apparatus on?  Because it's really thick. 
[02:24:00]  It's funny.  Can you get a shot of that?  Should we do one at a time or both?  Oh, my God.  All right, they're in there pretty good now, right?  Yes.  Do you have a good seal around your nuts so no bees are going to be jumping out?  Yes.  Dude, can you move your shirt?  We can't see from the side at all.  There you go.  And there's a...  Take the shirt off.  It's cool.  There's nutsack.  You can see what's going on in there.  Come on.  I'm going to get fucking...  Nathaniel, get a long shot, too, from the side.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Raphael, smile for Nathaniel.  He's like, one more.  Yeah.  Make sure you hold on to that apparatus.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, God.  Can you have any bag in there?  Yeah.  Can I get signed copies of that?  Is there plenty of sack in there?  Yeah, there's more than enough.  There's enough sack in there.  Okay.  Wait, Raphael, what are you thinking?  Yeah, right now, what are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  Are you nervous?  Be honest.  Oh, my God.  Fuck, let's just open it up and get it done with.  You're freaked out, aren't you?  This is the ultimate challenge.  This is why we're all here today, so...  Oh, my God.  This is the ultimate challenge.  Way to be a champion.  Ari is covering her face.  All right.  Ari's doing that girl thing. 
[02:25:00]  I don't know how the gate is open.  Ask for your fingers.  I feel like I'm doing a bit happy job.  Ask Bill how the gate gets open, because that looks like you're ready to open up the bottom  of the container.  Push the plastic clear lever towards the nozzle front.  Toward the nozzle.  Push it down.  And towards.  You're going to have to jiggle it a little.  Yeah.  Not too much.  Jiggle handle.  Push hard.  Oh.  Don't break the thing.  No.  This is Bill's 4-H project.  I don't like this.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, don't pull the lid off.  Yeah, you're pulling the lid off.  Bill, you're going to have to do it for him.  Bill, you're going to have to help him. 
[02:25:30]  Just get in there, Bill.  Just be a trooper.  Put your gloves on.  Grab a hold of that apparatus.  We are running out of show.  You're going to buy me new gloves after this.  We are running out of show at this point.  Now, how long is this going to stay on my sack?  Oh, shit.  There it goes.  All right.  They're in there.  All right.  They're in.  They're in.  All right.  They're in there.  Do you feel anything crawling on your sack yet?  I don't know.  I don't know, baby.  He doesn't know.  Holy shit, dude.  Are they on you?  They're tickling my bag.  Are you kidding?  Bill, I'm on your bag.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding. 
[02:26:00]  They're on his bag.  There's bees on his balls.  Oh, my God.  There's bees on his balls.  Oh, yes.  What?  Uh-oh.  What?  What?  Jump up and down.  Give us a jump up and down.  Oh, my God.  Don't be a pussy.  Dude, this is fucking.  This is crazy.  I just hate him.  Yeah, just jump up and down.  Just give it a big jump.  You mean it.  Like your twichels.  Boing!  Oh, my God.  All right, we're just waiting now.  No. 
[02:26:30]  I just want to rile him up a bit.  Yeah, rile him up a bit.  I think contestant number two ought to start preparing by getting his.  I think I just got stung.  Did you get stung?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I feel swelling.  You won't be able to get it out of the apparatus.  A fizzle help.  Dude, this is fucking.  This is crazy, guys.  This is nuts.  Are you tapping out or what?  No, I'm not tapping out.  I think we ought to get the other competitor ready.  Yeah, I say so, too.  These guys aren't.  This is nothing.  We don't want to run out of time.  Come on.  Just leave your bag in there.  Let the bees crawl around.  Oh, what the? 
[02:27:00]  The feeling of the bee on my ball, like, walking around is just fucking unexplainable.  How about wasps?  Wow, he got his sack in there pretty quickly.  Wait, now you got to open up the thing.  Yeah, you got to open the gate.  Oh, God.  They're tickling.  They're tickling?  I think you're going to know when you get stung.  I think they're going to stick to the.  I think they're just nibbling.  They don't realize that there's a threat. 
[02:27:30]  It looks like another nest to them.  All right, Steve from Connecticut is trying to open up the hatch.  Sweaty, nervous nest.  To release the bees into the apparatus.  How come Bill could do it so easily?  He was testing this out.  He was working on this apparatus all afternoon.  Bill.  Help him out.  Help him out.  Help him out, son.  All right, Bill will release the bees.  Did you move the paper towel roll?  Oh, fuck.  What happened?  You getting stung?  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  We got a break.  You broke the tube.  Oh, there's a breach. 
[02:28:00]  Is the tube broke?  Yeah, the tube snapped off.  Don't let him out.  They're not coming out.  It's secure again.  Dude, you got stung?  I'm opening this first.  Great.  Good blessing.  All right, he's opening them up.  Master Poe is making a weapon.  Stop it, Jimmy.  Jimmy started smacking me like I got a bee on me.  Fuck.  What happened?  Come on.  You got stung?  What honeybees, son?  They're harmless.  What happened?  It's not opening. 
[02:28:30]  It's just nature.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What?  You having sex with the bee or what?  Let me shoot him.  This kid's going to come out.  We're going to get a bee.  Can't get that gate open?  Damn it.  One of our apparatuses is busted.  Guy's waiting, balls in hand.  Just a big sack of balls hanging around.  A big handful of nutsack.  Oh, those bees are...  What happened, Bill?  Here we go.  All right, Bill.  There you go.  Bill's good, man.  Bill's good.  Bill's got it open. 
[02:29:00]  Bill's a fucking professional.  Give him a second to...  I'll get your nuts in there.  Oh, wow.  There's bees in there already.  That's all right.  Shove your nuts in there.  All right.  He's shoving his nuts into the bee apparatus thing.  No bees getting out.  Ow.  He's kidding.  Steve is...  Oh, Steve is already agitating the bees.  Fucking Steve is tapping them.  Daring them.  Steve is tapping.  He's daring them.  All right.  Now, do you have a good amount of sack in there?  Yeah, he's got his...  I see it hanging in there.  Yeah, there's a lot of...  Dude, he's got a leg in there.  All right.  Not as much as I can get in there.  Now, lift up the phallic-looking thing and tip it back so all the bees get in there. 
[02:29:30]  Mm.  Did you get stung at all, Raphael?  Twice already.  I swear to God.  Now, tap the bottom of your apparatus.  It's on the table.  Tea bagging some bees.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Tea bag, a cup of coffee, not bees.  Do you want to tap the apparatus?  I think...  You got to shake it to get them flying around a little.  I think it was licking my balls.  Licking?  Licking.  Bees have tongues?  Oh, there we go.  Are they on there? 
[02:30:00]  What are they doing?  These suck.  What are they doing?  Nothing.  They're just fucking hanging out there.  I think you got to jump up and down and get a sign of levitate.  There you go.  All right, Steve is rocking and rolling.  Oh, he's getting them.  Steve is jumping up and down a couple feet in the air.  And they're still just laying at the bottom, all fucking...  Well, they probably can't breathe anymore.  Yeah.  Whoa.  That'll piss them off.  You feel them around your ball bag or anything?  No.  You should have painted your sack like a beautiful flower.  I can't get teed on my balls with sugar and shit.  What the fuck? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Where are those wasps?  You may need them.  And you got stung.  Twice.  Twice.  Yes.  Are they moving around your ball bag still?  Uh, they're walking around, definitely.  Fucking agitate them.  I did.  Hey, I got stung twice, dear.  I'm trying to get stung.  They won't let me.  Oh, I see one walking up on the side.  Here we go.  Maybe he's getting closer.  One was flying around in there.  I won't agitate him for a minute.  See what they do.  They got to kind of get acclimated to their new surroundings. 
[02:31:00]  Perhaps that's it.  All right, they're, uh...  That worked for me.  Oh, one's crawling up the side again.  Could make contact with your nuts soon.  Now, Opie, what I'm worried about is when I remove my bag from this unit...  Yeah, we're all going to be worried.  It's what we're all worried about.  Yeah.  That's why they got the bee suits on.  My balls are sticky.  I mentioned it several times.  So you think maybe a couple of bees might be stuck to your nuts?  Yes.  So we'll just swat them.  Well, you know what?  We're running out of show, so we got to get Matt involved.  So, Raphael, why don't you pass over the apparatus to Matt?  Hopefully... 
[02:31:30]  Make sure the bees...  How many bees are on your ball?  None.  EMT, guys.  Check them out.  See if you got stung or not.  What's that?  It's a fucking pubic hair stung.  You know what?  I can see them on the toilet all the time.  Pull off your pubic hair and pass on the apparatus.  I say the wasps.  You got to go for wasps.  You got to get the wasps.  Oh!  I don't know.  Just do it over the jar.  Matt's shaking them up.  Oh, Matt's a fucking kook.  He is shaking them up.  Watch the tube doesn't fall off of that one. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, let's be careful.  All right.  Now we're ready to roll.  Oh, yeah.  They're rocking and rolling.  Look at these.  They're coming right up.  They're coming right up.  What happened?  You might have...  The bees might have suffocated.  All right, here we go.  Matt is throwing his ball bag into the apparatus with the bees.  Get the wasps.  That's a nice contraption.  Very well thought out, yeah.  What the fuck?  Uh-oh.  He's trying to squeeze his ball bag in there.  I'm in a little trouble. 
[02:32:30]  They didn't bother you, huh, Steve?  No, hold up.  Oh, my gosh.  Watch the...  Don't pull that tube out.  Oh, he's shaking them up now.  Get them all angry.  Hoo-hoo, he's copying off of me shaking them.  You got to get them up.  Up by your...  Fucking break.  No, they're not.  They're all down.  They're fucking...  Look at them.  They're moving.  This whole thing has literally left me speechless.  Literally.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to think of something.  It's like...  It's actually taking all the words out of my head.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Will blowing into them help?  No.  Most of them are lying on their back. 
[02:33:00]  They're not doing anything.  All right.  Well, they're fucking...  All right.  Matt's sacked.  What?  You get bitten, Matt?  No.  Matt is...  Matt's got the apparatus on.  He's moving the apparatus.  He's trying to...  Agitate the bees.  Bees are fucking creeps.  All right.  I got a wasp.  I got two wasps.  You want to bring them in?  Yeah, bring in the wasps.  All right.  Let's see if we can get...  Uh-oh, Po.  I just got mine in.  Yeah, well, Matt, you can keep yours on.  Ooh.  There's nothing worse than a wasp. 
[02:33:30]  Uh, Po, when you open that lid, don't let them fly out.  Yeah.  These have to go.  Oh, here they come.  Here they come, Matt.  Oh, they're pissed.  Yeah?  Here they come.  See them?  Yeah, they're all over the...  Oh, Jesus.  They're moving up the wall of the apparatus.  No, you should just put the ball...  No, no.  Leave the wasps in the jar.  They should put his balls over that jar, bro.  Leave them in the jar.  What's that?  Leave them in the jar, dude.  Then we can see it.  And we can just put it...  You can just keep...  Put his balls in there.  Don't dump them in there.  Ari's got to go.  Guys, I'm going to head out.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you so much for having me here. 
[02:34:00]  We'll have you back again.  We'll have you back.  I hope your balls are okay.  Oh, they're on me.  They're on me.  Yeah, dude.  Put the ball...  There's only one wasp in each one.  We only have five minutes of show left.  Five minutes of show.  I just put them...  It's only one.  Oh, what happened?  Nothing.  They're like...  There's like four of them on me.  Crawling on your...  There's four on your nutsack?  Let's see if you can go the longest.  Yeah, champ.  Put that bell.  Put the wasp.  Wow.  Where's Raphael?  Getting checked out.  Okay, he's fine.  All right, put your balls in the wasp one.  He's fine.  Just got stung twice in the nutsack. 
[02:34:30]  What do you want me to do?  Are we going to go head-to-head with each other?  No.  Guys, we are running out of show, so...  We don't have time to do much of anything.  Right in.  Right in.  And just make sure you get a nice seal.  Oh, watch out.  Oh, shit.  Get a nice seal there.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, ow.  All right, there...  I got stung, yeah.  Did you get stung?  Did you get stung?  Oh, no.  Where?  Wasp crawling by the wall.  It's coming up.  You got stung in the sack?  Yeah.  And now the wasp is...  The wasp is now making its way up the jar. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, God.  This is in the way here.  Oh, no.  How close is the wasp?  Oh, shit.  I can feel it on my nut.  Like, his feelers come in and around, and he walks away.  Jumping, yeah.  Matt is jumping up and down.  He's got a wasp in a jar.  Christ.  That is sick.  Oh, yeah.  That's sick.  Is he on your ball bag?  No, now he's walking back.  Get back here.  They're trying to get stung in the balls by a wasp. 
[02:35:30]  They're attempting.  The wasp is disappointing them by his lack of willingness to sting their testicles.  Can I have the jars when you're done?  I'm making jelly later.  Sure, Fez.  I'll sign my jar for you after the show.  There we go.  Oh, oh.  Oh, yeah.  Here he comes.  Boy, are you pissing that thing off?  Hello.  Hello.  Is he up on your sack?  He's right under my fucking sack.  Oh, god damn.  Come on, you fucking cunt.  Wow.  Excuse my English.  Dirty talking.  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  These wasps suck.  We need more vicious bugs.  Let's try this in the spring.  Where'd you get these fucking bees from?  Berkeley?  What are you doing, bro?  Oh, he's really just fucking up the wasps.  He's shaking it up.  Why doesn't they get on their backs and let the wasps fall onto them?  Good point.  You know what, Bill?  You raised an excellent point.  Someone, quick, up on the console on your back.  Fuck it.  I'm not kidding.  All right.  What does he got?  What do you got?  These are four.  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:36:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Jesus Christ!  What?  Holy shit!  Hey, uh.  Holy shit!  Hey, champ.  That came out of nowhere!  Hey, champ, why don't you take that one?  Holy crap!  No, no, no, Paul, leave it there.  Leave it like that, Paul.  Champ.  Holy shit!  Why don't you take that one?  He's obviously a fucking, he's no longer playing games.  Did you see him jump in, did he?  Holy shit!  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  He pops up to the top.  Wait, where's that? 
[02:37:00]  Not yet.  What do I want to do?  Where's that last jar?  Oh, there you go.  Okay, he's got it.  Now he's got the pissed off wasp.  He's got the pissed off wasp.  Is he going right for the nut?  Oh, goddammit.  Oh, my God.  That just ain't right?  That guy, that guy.  Steve jumped like I've never seen anyone jump before in my life.  Oh, my God.  Who brought another jar in?  What was in the other jar?  Four, uh, small paper wasps that I'm shaking up vigorously.  You want to go for the four paper wasps?  Sure.  When are those fucking going to get me started? 
[02:37:30]  That one wasp is getting really pissed.  This wasp has a taste for it now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No, that's how it works.  God damn it.  No, not that jar.  Not the nest.  Plug it up.  That thing is going to hurt.  Nest.  Nest.  Nest.  Nest.  Nest.  Nest.  Oh, god.  I'm petrified.  You can't put your balls with a wasp nest.  We got a minute.  We only have a minute left in the show.  A minute left in the show.  Oh, he's going with the entire wasp nest.  A minute left in the show.  Holy shit.  When the show ends, just end it because we can't get plugs or anything. 
[02:38:00]  Plug that shit up.  We only have a minute left in the show.  Can we go a little long?  Is it possible to?  No, we can't go long.  No, it cuts off and it'll go right to a. . .  All right, we got a minute 15.  Matt has put the jar that has the nest of bees.  Don't drop it if you get stung.  Don't drop it.  Holy shit.  Jump up and down.  Jump up and down.  This is the grand finale.  Matt.  Woo!  The current ball champion.  He has his balls in a jar that has a little wasp nest.  I'm going to pull onto you.  Wow.  Anything? 
[02:38:30]  50 seconds.  They're on it.  Here they come.  They're on it.  They're on it.  Here they come.  Oh, shit.  Here they come.  We have 40 seconds left in the show.  He is basically shaking the jar upside down right onto his nutsack.  Oh, god damn it.  You put the entire nest against his sack.  Oh, my god.  The whole nest is against his sack.  30 seconds left in the show.  What courage.  30 seconds.  The cameras are rolling.  This is for the title, Matt.  You are a madman.  Ah! 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Ah!  Hold the jar.  Oh, my god.  Get the jar.  Again.  Where's the cover?  Put the man.  Give him the cover.  Give him the cover.  Give him the cover.  Oh, my god.  Give him the cover.  Don't spray his balls.  Don't spray his balls.  Kill him again.  Give him the cover.  Give him the fucking cover.  Give him the fucking cover.  Give him the cover.

[02:43:30]  That's right, Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  And what was just so disturbing about Uncle Paul today is that he did the voice of the person yelling at him,  and you could hear someone saying,  Paul, get your dick out between the crib bars.  So gross.  I'm so happy that having a child hasn't diminished my love for Uncle Paul. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  You still enjoy it?  It's hysterical.  I was commenting in the back that it's like, you know,  no one's going to sit here and realistically think that molesting a baby is a good time.  No, it's a bad thing.  But if you have the kind of humor where you listen to a joke like that and you can't laugh hysterically,  I just don't want you in my life.  I just don't need to know you.  I also loved that the characters started morphing into his real life when Jim saw Coco Jones,  who I guess is like a Disney Channel star, who's the daughter of a football player named Mike Jones. 
[02:44:30]  And she was with her father.  Jim thought they must be boyfriend-girlfriend.  And he was talking about how beautiful she was and how much he wanted to kiss her.  We looked her up on Wikipedia.  She's 14 years old.  She is 14 years old.  Jim apologized immediately for his discretions.  Rich in Buffalo.  Yeah, you guys just touched on something that I always think about.  I think anybody's rich in Buffalo.  I can laugh hysterically at Uncle Paul. 
[02:45:00]  And then I stop and think about it and go, wait a minute.  This is like awful, you know.  Yeah, what a fucking asshole this guy is.  I know.  Well, but what's funny, I think what makes it acceptable is that Jim will,  if we're talking about a child molestation story, Jim will morph in and out.  So one moment, you'll have Norton, who's appalled by this person who molested a kid.  And then the next moment, he's morphed into Uncle Paul, who's relating to this guy. 
[02:45:30]  And then the next moment, he's back to Norton being appalled.  So it's like, okay, I got the guy who's appalled.  So I don't, it's okay to laugh at this character.  Yeah, and plus he takes it out to such an extreme level, I think, and that's where.  Well, yeah, I think when Uncle Paul turned the corner is when he started mentioning his penis  and dropping all subtleties from his act.  It used to be all just implied molestation.  Now it's just like, yeah, what I do is I have the little baby touch my penis. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I remember like a couple of years ago, it was like, oh, sure, I used to take care of you when you were a kid.  Now it's like, oh, you used to put your little lips on my balls.  Yeah, yeah, and it's like, what?  You can't say that.  Uncle Paul Hargis is on the phone.  I don't like the fact you're misrepresenting me.  I'm not misrepresenting you, Uncle Paul.  The little Trump bottom Danny over there saying I said this and that.  I didn't say none of those things.  You've gone on the air and you specifically mentioned baby hands on your penis. 
[02:46:30]  There's a nun.  I know, this is the best part about this.  There's a nun who's looking into the studio right now.  There's three old women and one of them is a nun and we're talking about Uncle Paul molesting babies.  Yeah, she's probably a big cow tail.  Meanwhile, she's spanking everybody with a ruler.  Nobody's checking to see if she's damping her, you know what.  Well, either way, it's a terrible thing to do.  Why don't you shut up?  No, why don't you shut up?  You make a lot of people uncomfortable. 
[02:47:00]  You're a little potty man and your father used to call me over and say Sam's misbehaving.  Can you straighten him out?  My father.  So you're.  Get right in there in your little hulk a maniac outfit.  No, Uncle Paul.  My father never punished me through molestation.  Yeah, he did.  He'd say, hey, Paul, why don't you give Sam the world's greatest treat?  And then you'd be rolling around on your belly for three days.  Sam, you obviously don't remember when Paul took you on that wrestling outing when you  went to see the big show. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, we'd only have one share and Sam would have to bounce in my lap.  Up, down, up, down.  Yay, the Hulk a man.  Yay.  The Hulk a man.  You come home and reenact some of the wrestling matches that you've seen?  Yeah, here comes King Kong Brady.  Yay.  Everybody's wrestling.  I don't like you slandering me.  I'll sue you if you keep saying I had baby hands all over my penis.  I didn't say nothing about little soft, cuddly baby hands on my penis, cupping it like experts. 
[02:48:00]  I heard something about cupping it like experts.  First of all, you called a four-year-old a lady today.  I didn't say nothing about none of them little raffle-shaking hands expertly moving back and  forth over my genitals.  I didn't say that.  You're putting words in my mouth.  Didn't I hear something about your penis going through crib bars?  I was trying to hang something on the mofo, and I had my shorts, and it fell through. 
[02:48:30]  It ain't my fault that kid saw it.  Well, no, look, a candy factory or whatever it was she thought and such.  He said the kid was going for it like a hamster to a water bottle.  Yeah.  Paul.  I didn't know what to do.  I got to go.  I'm in the car.  Goodbye, Uncle Paul.  I don't know.  That's just disgusting.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony's Sirius XM. 
[02:49:00]  Plug whore Jim Norton here.  Since we're off, I have to plug my dates.  This New Year's Eve, I will be making my return to Buffalo.

And January 25th, 26th, of course, I'll be in San Diego at the American Comedy Company, my very first weekend in San Diego. 
[02:49:30]  Who gives a shit, Jim?  The Antisocial Comedy Tour, the Antisocial Comedy Tour, February 17th, it returns to the Borgata in Atlantic City.  Bit of a different lineup.  Myself, Artie Lang, Dave Attell, and Amy Schumer.  We've done one show together so far.  It's sold out, and it was amazing.  So February 17th at the Borgata, and then April 11th through 14th, I return to New York to do Caroline's Comedy Club.  That's all I have for now.  Happy New Year.  Ron found out he was in big trouble with the IRS. 
[02:50:00]  Between the state and the feds, I found out I owed $70,000.  Ron had no idea what to do.  There was no way I could have paid that off.  They were getting ready to garnish my wages.  Who knows what else?  Until he heard about 911 tax relief.  911 tax relief.  That was exactly what I needed.  They talked to the IRS for me.  I didn't have to make one phone call.  They just kept those guys off my back.  And within an hour, they had it figured out.  Done.  911 tax relief has an A rating with the Better Business Bureau. 
[02:50:30]  So if you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes, and you're faced with bank levies or wage garnishments,  or if you have unfiled tax returns, do what Ron did and call 911 tax relief at 800-624-0704.

Serious accent.  Worst of Opie and Anthony, my name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  And we're doing Saga Day.  You just heard multiple parts of Club Piscopo.  And now we move into a request that I actually got on Twitter.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  From Gabe Rep. 
[02:58:00]  G-A-B-E-R-E-P-P on Twitter.  I don't know where he's from.  I'm sure it doesn't really matter.  Oh, South Texas.  There you go.  He asked, how come we've never played the original Eggnog Drinking Challenge?  We always play the one that features Pat Duffy and Pat Fumanaki doing the infamous Baby Bird.  But we never play the original one.  So I dug back, looked through, found it.  From 2004, we are going to explore.  Ooh, that rhymed.  The original Eggnog Drinking Challenge when we first came to XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:58:30]  Here it is.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony series.  XM.  I think it's time for the Eggnog Drinking Contest on the Opie and Anthony program.  Steve is in place with his video camera, filming it for opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Ant hates these type of things.  I kind of get giddy.  I like these things.  Look at all the Eggnog is out.  Many cups lined up. 
[02:59:00]  Yes, our ten contestants.  My brother Darren is going to be one of the official pours.  Mathematically, this is a little rough.  Because if these guys are doing shots every minute and there's ten guys, do a little quick math.  That would be six seconds per cup.  Six seconds to pour out each cup so that everyone's ready for the next shot.  I'm up for the challenge.  You're up for the challenge.  Yes, absolutely.  It's a challenge within a challenge, Opie.  Do we have enough Eggnog opened up?  I think this is going to be just a clusterfuck. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, I have confidence in our guys, but I don't know.  I think something's going to go horribly wrong here, Anthony.  They're dirty animals.  I think it's probably closer to five seconds per pour because you're going to need a little bit of time for them to then pick it up and do the shot.  Yes.  You know, the in-between time.  This sounds like the Warren Commission, you know, with the shots.  I need to reload the cartridge before I pour again.  He can't possibly reload those cups quick enough.  You have me consorting with a real cast of beverages. 
[03:00:00]  All right.  It looks like they've got a system in place.  All right.  We'll see if it works out.  Noah's helping out.  It's his birthday today.  Oh.  Happy birthday, Noah.  Happy birthday.  Will you be banging a porn star for your birthday today?  Next month, hopefully.  Next month, hopefully.  We're getting them on the books.  She'll be back.  Did she call you or text you with a happy birthday message?  No, not yet.  She knows, though.  We talked last night, so she's good to go.  Oh, you talked last night.  Yeah, we did.  You guys really have something going.  No, not really.  I think we kindled a little something.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, you do.  You anxiously wait for a phone call.  It's kind of a relationship. 
[03:00:30]  You know when you're next seeing each other.  You call and talk to each other or text each other.  Technically, it's a relationship.  It's really low maintenance.  That's for sure.  I got to give you that one.  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  You don't have a steady?  No.  That wouldn't last very long at this point.  No?  No.  No, because he's banging a porn star on the side.  What girlfriend's going to put up with that?  That is kind of tough to tell your girlfriend.  A really good one.  A really good one.  There's a few of them out there that would.  Would, but.  I guess.  I don't know.  Congrats.  All right. 
[03:01:00]  Good for you.  Thank you.  And then we got Nathaniel.  In between doing stand-up, he's now an official pour in the eggnog drinking contest.  Well, we all have dreams, Opie.  All right.  I guess we're ready for the contestants.  Oh, boy.  I just had a cup.  I could probably do five shots.  Really?  Is it thick and creamy and noggy?  Yeah, but it has a watery undertone to it.  It's thick with a watery undertone.  You know what?  It's like drinking a blood clot.  Listen.  Listen, you're good, but Anthony is brilliant when it comes to describing what contestants 
[03:01:30]  have to direct.  You did such a great job with the chowder eating contest.  The chowder was easy to describe.  The eggnog is a little harder, but it is, I don't know, a creamy mix.  There you go.  Just thick and creamy with a heavy flavor of vanilla.  Lukewarm.  Lukewarm.  And unfortunately, the cups are a little too tall to fill it up to the tippity top, but  it's up to the tippity top of the line.  Of the line. 
[03:02:00]  Pushing a little over the line.  And you just have to swig it down.  Perhaps it backs up a little in your esophagus where you can't get it down quite fast enough.  You've got to give it an extra swallow.  You've got to wish you had maybe a little piece of bread to kind of tamp it down.  And then before you know it, oh, the next shot.  Ready to go.  Thick and creamy like the first.  Filled right up to the tippy top of that line.  And down she goes for another one.  Gulp. 
[03:02:30]  And oh, before it even reaches your stomach, before you feel that gentle caress of thick  nog lining your stomach walls.  Bam!  It's time for another.  And the cup is full in front of you.  And just like the first two, you belt it down.  And thick and hearty.  And creamy as it is.  And getting warmer and warmer.  It works its way down.  Just a little warmer than the last shot.  And you just know shot after shot after shot is going to get a little warmer and warmer and warmer. 
[03:03:00]  And the ones at the edge next to Steve's shirt are going to be bubbling, piping hot, dare I say.  So good luck to all our contestants washing this mix down.  That's how you describe it, Morgan.  Wonderful.  He's the pro.  It's hilarious.  All right.  Let's get the contestants in here.  We've stalled enough.  Bringing them in.  Ten of them, huh?  You're going to have room for all these guys?  Ten contestants.  Filthy, savage. 
[03:03:30]  We've had to remove.  I want to let everyone know that knows the description of the studio.  We've had to remove the lesbian couch.  That space is now replaced with lined garbage pails.  And fat guys.  Looks like my bathroom floor.  Yeah, there's plastic on the floor.  And there's garbage pails.  There's garbage pails where the lesbian couch usually is.  And, guys, I cannot emphasize enough that those pails are there. 
[03:04:00]  They are to be used just in case that creamy, thick mix of egg and nog starts working its way back up.  You can turn around, grab a pail, and go to town.  All right.  Well, why don't we meet our contestants, Anthony?  Let's meet our contestants.  And don't forget we've got five other contestants from all over the country that are playing as well.  Right.  They guessed how many shots the last guy's going to do without puking.  We'll see who's right, and they will see if it might fire as well.  Who do we got?  How you doing, guys? 
[03:04:30]  I'm Dice.  Hey, Dice.  What's up?  I brought you those shirts.  I brought some DVDs this time around.  I just got to say, that shit dick song fucked me up.  Yeah, you like the shit dick?  I was banging a chick in the ass on Wednesday night.  I finish, and I'm humming shit dick the whole time.  It's not the best thing you want to do.  The chick I'm banging likes a shit dick.  We'll play that again for you.  Thank you.  All right.  As soon as you puke, we'll play that for you.  Works for me.  Where are you from, Dice?  Long Island.  Long Island.  Right on.  Of course.  We met Pat.  Pat.  Hi.  From earlier.  I really should be working to pay off those tickets. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, he did our last contest.  It cost him like $900.  Yeah.  Because he decided you could just, yeah, park your van in the middle of 57th Street in  New York City.  He had a suspended license.  He got arrested for it.  He even stands like a psychopath.  Your favorite.  With the hands straight down, not moving.  How much do you weigh, Pat?  $350.  $350.  He's got to be one of the favorites.  I'm thinking the fatter guys are the favorites today.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, this would be my forte.  Forte.  All right.  Thanks.  And Pat, where are you from again? 
[03:05:30]  Munaki, New Jersey.  That's right.  Munaki.  All right.  Jersey.  And then we got Matt.  What's up, Matt?  What's going on?  Where are you from, bro?  Jersey.  More Jersey guys.  Jersey just supporting the show.  Jersey represent.  Wow.  Big time.  Any shout outs?  Anything you want to say before the contest begins?  Just if you've got a Dodge truck, like to work on it, check out RamChargerCentral.com.  It's a good message board.  Yeah, I'm plugging my website here.  What the hell, man?  Fine.  You should get at least five hits from that today.  All right. 
[03:06:00]  You belong to a truck message board?  Do you put in parentheses, sound of air horn?  That's quite exciting.  Driveshaft, LOL.  Do they have names like that?  No.  Like Hemi?  Sure.  I'm Hemi 102.  Hey, hi.  How you doing?  Hey, whatever.  Yeah.  It's just a place to go if you need help with your truck. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, you sound a little taller in email.  All right.  All right, let's move on to Joe.  Joe, where are you from?  From Queens.  Queens.  Nice.  Representing Queens.  Anything?  No, I can't compete with truck driving message boards, so right now I'm thinking this is probably  the worst idea I've done this morning.  How many shots do you think you could do?  The guys are starting to look at the eggnog.  Yeah.  You know what?  You can see them.  I don't even think.  It's the color.  It's this.  Oh.  I'm going to try to do 20, and then I might have to punch. 
[03:07:00]  Let's be honest with the color.  It's like old jizz yellow.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a hepatitis load.  Hey, how do you feel about Pedro joining your Mets there in Queens?  See, I'm a Yankee fan, so you know what?  I'm glad we got Randy last night.  Did they really?  Well, it's still got to work on some deal through the Dodgers.  Eric Duncan, something like three minor leaguers.  Vasquez goes to L.A. 
[03:07:30]  The fucking Yankees.  Can they stop giving up young talent for 50-year-old pitchers?  Cocksucker Steinbrenner.  That really annoys me.  Thanks.  Young talent.  Fucking Yankees.  Thank you, Joe.  Who else?  From Queens.  Do it again.  BJ.  We know BJ.  He's been around the block a few times.  Where are you from, BJ, again?  Oakdale.  Oakdale.  Long Island representing Anthony.  Anything you want to say today?  Hey, BJ.  I want to say hi to Big Dave and Thundar out in Oakdale and everybody in whackbag.com.  And I'll plug Hugbox.net, you know, free girl porn site, you know. 
[03:08:00]  Hugbox.  Do you ever do any drinking down at the wharf down there?  Yeah.  On the water?  Yeah, you used to go down there a lot when we had a boat.  This is a shithole.  I know.  It's a real shithole.  But it's a great place to go if you have a boat real close.  Yeah.  You do some drinking.  You go out on the boat.  You drink.  You come back.  Maybe slam some guy from Pennsylvania in the back of the head.  Come back.  Drink more.  It's a lot of fun.  Then you go on NEW and do a radio show.  Baby. 
[03:08:30]  Fabulous.  BJ.  All right, BJ.  Thank you.  Bang the girls from the college over there, do you?  What college is there?  Dowling?  Dowling.  No, I don't talk to anybody in Dowling.  Nothing good there at Dowling?  No, there's a bunch of black people and Chinese people.  Black people and Chinese people?  Yeah, we don't, like, talk to them much.  Good boy.  If they're not stealing, they're staring blank with no expression on their face.  Gotta love Oakdale.  Thank you, BJ.  All right.  You're welcome.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Where are you from, bud?  I'm from Connecticut. 
[03:09:00]  Connecticut representing.  Yeah.  And what do you want to say today?  I don't know much.  I want to say hello to the guys at obanthony.net.  I'm on there as Grizzly.  Also, thank my sister for coming down.  Moral support today.  She's out.  I thought she was going to be in the contest.  We were hoping one of these girls were going to be in the contest today.  Well, she really doesn't like eggnog.  Who does, though?  I know.  I do.  Yeah.  Oh, we were going to have little bite-sized fruitcakes here.  All right.  We forgot about that.  A little awful fruitcakes.  I see it's Land O'Lakes eggnog.  Yeah.  The same company that makes the butter.  So it's all creamy, buttery, I'm sure, also. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I'm ready.  And you guys, make sure you don't puke on us, please.  You guys all look around and see where the garbage pails are.  We should have made the meat.  Do our best.  Eggnog and some sort of meat.  Some sort of meat?  A little cube of meat.  Like pork?  Yeah.  Okay.  That wouldn't be kosher.  Joe Rogan giving out 50 grand.  No thanks.  All right.  Let's move on to Steve over there, who's wearing one of my brother's fine T-shirts, I noticed.  Oh.  Of course.  Turn around, man.  Last month.  Got a sign on the back by the artist today.  All right on. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  My brother's what's-in-your-pants T-shirts.  Fine T-shirts.  Very cool.  Not much to say.  From Brooklyn.  All right.  You can email Dr. Duckhasm.  Dr. Duckhasm?  Dr. D-U-K at AOL.com if you want one of these fine, open Anthony what's-in-your-pants  T-shirts.  Shameless plug.  Shameless plug.  Speaking of shameless plugs, eatable.com.  Thank you, mister.  Oh, look at you, Steve.  Anything else you want to say?  Downtown, December 23rd, next Thursday.  Oh, by the way, Nathaniel will also be performing there with me. 
[03:10:30]  Our intern will be doing some-  Yeah, Norton at the downtown.  Throwing the kid a bone.  Yeah, he's funny.  Who's breathing like Darth Vader?  Is that you?  Yeah, what's wrong, Steve?  Wow.  Nothing's a little hot in here.  We were on the Death Star.  It's really hot in here.  It's hot, so you have emphysema.  It really is hot in here, which is going to make this contest even worse.  Oh, even better.  Oh, man.  The eggnog is starting to boil.  Oh, by the second, it's just getting hotter and hotter.  It's starting to get a little clumpy, I noticed, Anthony.  Oh.  All right.  Ellis, we talked. 
[03:11:00]  He had his stomach done, so he's just not going to last.  Who is he kidding?  I'd like to dedicate winning this my fight to my surgeon who helped me lose 140 pounds.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  If I don't pass out first.  Okay.  And then, finally, Doug.  We talked to Doug earlier, too.  He's from Arizona.  He flew in just for the contest, Anthony.  Dedication.  Anything you want to say, Doug?  Go Sun Devils in the Sun Bowl.  Fuck Purdue.  Fuck Purdue.  All right.  There you go.  All right, Doug.  Fuck a chicken.  All right.  I think we're ready. 
[03:11:30]  Do you want to get the rules, Anthony?  They're pretty simple, I guess.  The rules are simple.  Our contestants will do one of these glasses full of creamy eggnog every minute.  Every minute.  If you puke, out and see.  If you have to take a leak, whether it's in your pants or you actually leave and go to  the bathroom, oot.  You're oot.  The last guy left that has not puked or pissed himself is the winner of the MiFi.  That is how we play the game. 
[03:12:00]  Do you all understand?  Very good.  You guys all know what cup you're going for?  I guess the cups are numbered, Dan.  Yeah, we will not be doing a Le Mans start where they run to their cups.  And you guys all know where the garbage pails are, right?  Sadly, right behind me.  Yes, please, more important than an exit in a building on fire, please take note.  Just pick up whichever cup you want. 
[03:12:30]  You're going to have to hold it the whole time.  Wait, one question.  Do we have to kind of slam them, or can we take the whole minute to drink?  Whatever you want.  You will have a whole minute.  You can strategically use that minute however you want if you want to do it slow.  But then just remember, the next one's right around the corner.  Some guys that want to chug it can then use the rest of the minute to relax and maybe  get that down.  Guys, here's the deal, too.  We've got two sets of cups here because they're pouring as you're drinking, all right?  So just try to go for the, well, whatever.  Just grab one.  Can I make a holiday toast for the first shot? 
[03:13:00]  Sure, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  Good one, Ken.  Let's everyone raise their glass to our hosts, Opie and Anthony, because, and of course,  little Jim, who I love dear.  Now, don't drink until you hear the bell because we want it on one of the secondhand  on the 12.  We're going to go right at the 12, Kenny.  So go.  Go with your toast.  You've got five seconds.  But without Opie and Anthony, this would not be made possible.  So here we go.  Cheers.  And there's the first one.  The contest has begun, Anthony. 
[03:13:30]  It has begun.  Every time that secondhand sweeps to the 12.  All right.  No, you don't have to drink it right away.  Yeah, hold your, you should hold the glasses.  Oh, they're just going to be doing it.  Hold on.  No, no.  Yeah, but then we won't be able to keep track.  It's got to be every minute.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Every minute, guys.  Every minute.  Every minute.  They're already wrecking the contest.  You do one a minute.  You can't start chugging them all down.  I like that enthusiasm, though.  I like that, too.  All right.  Everyone did their first shot of eggnog, right?  What did it taste like?  It tasted like the spit bucket from Bob Murphy.  And that guy, fill up Steve's cup. 
[03:14:00]  He screwed up.  He's officially on the clock for drinking only one eggnog.  Right.  He decided to get cocky, Anthony, and do two right away.  Opie, if this comes down to one eggnog and he's in it and it worked out that that extra  shot he did puts him over the top, I'm sure we'll have a disappointed lad.  All right.  The cups are all filled.  Wow.  And look how quickly this comes about.  Wow.  That is quick.  All right.  Two.  One.  And here goes the second round.  Second round. 
[03:14:30]  Eggnog drinking motherfuckers.  Goes down as easy as the first.  I see BJ's taking that slower drinking of the eggnog.  Doug from Arizona is having a little problem.  I see it in his face.  What's going on, Doug?  Strategy.  Do we have a mic over there?  I'm six.  Strategy.  Strategy.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Slow and steady wins the race.  All right.  So, Anthony, everyone finish their second?  Everyone finish their second.  John automatically grabbed his third and he's holding it there.  Eager beaver.  Ellis, what's going on with that little stomach of yours? 
[03:15:00]  No problem.  Not a problem at all.  He's got a nog mustache going on.  It's out there.  All right.  Looks like he just got a ride from an older gentleman.  Jesus.  All right, Anthony, we're getting close to the third round.  Everyone's got their eggnog in their hands waiting for the start of the third round here.  Amazing how quickly that minute goes by, isn't it?  Wow.  A little too quick, right?  It's here already.  I'm thinking after five or so, you're going to start seeing a bit of a change.  And here goes the third round.  And the people's attitudes. 
[03:15:30]  I'm looking around the room.  Dice is doing okay in the corner there.  Joe is the first to finish there.  BJ's, everyone's down.  How's everyone feeling?  Still confident?  Still confident.  Wow.  It's starting to weigh me down.  Yeah, Joe, what's going on?  It's starting to weigh Joe down a little bit.  What?  What's going on, Joe?  You don't look too good already.  Yeah, I said it's starting to weigh me down like Connor and Lacey.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Ben, anything else?  Any other observations?  All right, Anthony, the third round is done by everybody. 
[03:16:00]  We're filling up the cups for the fourth round.  Is anyone starting to think, wow, I might not be able to do this after just three?  No.  Anyone?  No?  How about you, Steve?  You're on your ninth.  I'm fine.  Good to go.  Good to go?  Good to go, Jim.  All right.  Any trash talking?  Nothing?  You guys are?  I think Dice over there is starting to puss out, man.  Oh, wow.  No.  I got moved over by the bird, man.  I was fine on the other side of Pat.  All right, here we go.  If I got a puke, I can climb over him.  Hit the bell for the fourth round.  Here we go.  Oh, this is the fourth double shot of eggnog. 
[03:16:30]  It really does come around quickly.  Oh, it sure does.  All right.  Joe slammed his cup down.  Thank you.  There they go.  Doug from Arizona.  Pat, how you holding up over there?  The big guy, Pat?  Tastes like pancake batter.  Tastes like pancake batter?  Warm pancake batter, Anthony.  And why would you know what pancake batter tastes like?  Ooh.  Ooh, a little trash.  I like it.  All right.  Nice punch in the stomach after a bunch of eggnog.  Let's find out what's in my pants.  A good horse foot to the stomach. 
[03:17:00]  Another carton gun.  Ellis, you were a little slow there.  You all right?  I'm just pacing myself.  He's the guy with the small stomach.  Yeah.  He's not going to last too much longer.  I got a minute to drink this thing, you said.  Yeah, you're right.  Hold on.  We're getting ready for the fifth shot.  Wait for the bell.  Wow.  Go ahead, raising the stomach.  They already got four double shots in them, Anthony.  How could that little stomach hold that?  It won't.  It really won't.  Yeah.  We are coming around again.  Another minute is complete.  And there you go.  This is the fifth double shot of eggnog. 
[03:17:30]  Let's look and see.  It's not going down as fast with a couple of people.  Joe's got, I don't know, your eyes are tearing a little bit or something's going on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got a little redder in the face, a little hotter in here.  Anyone else have something to say?  Just raise your hand and Eric will give you the mic.  Ellis is sipping it like it's a Manhattan.  Ellis has a minute.  Ellis is the one with the small stomach.  I've got another 30 seconds before I've got to finish this one.  Yes, you do.  But then the next one will start immediately.  Anybody else?  Anyone else?  When did a small stomach become equal to you to a pussy, exactly? 
[03:18:00]  You were talking shit outside.  Like, oh, I can do this.  I wasn't the one out there blowing a midget to stay warm.  Oh.  Wow.  Hey.  Wow.  I don't know what that means, but whatever it is.  Ellis just finished.  I'll leave it on that one.  I've got nothing.  All right.  Ellis.  With 15 seconds left, Ellis finishes up.  Five shots done already, right?  Five shots were on?  Yeah, somebody's got to keep tabs on this.  This is the sixth round coming up in about five seconds.  Is that number six?  I think they're going to get to the ten easily, and then it's going to get interesting, Anthony.  Yeah.  Get ready.  There we go, guys.  Sixth round has begun.  Sixth round of eggnog. 
[03:18:30]  And Joe is the one who's fishing consistently first.  Got to get him down quick and then rest for 40 seconds, I guess.  That would seem to be the good strategy.  I think the guys that are nursing it for the whole minute, a little more pressure is on these guys.  Has everyone finished?  Even Ellis slammed that one.  Okay.  Anyone feeling anything?  He's stepping up.  I'm feeling good, man.  I'm good.  Everyone's good so far.  It's coming out of Ellis' nose and ears now, though.  That could be a problem.  Yeah.  Ellis is leaking eggnog a little bit. 
[03:19:00]  Uh-oh.  All right.  They're filling up the cups, Anthony.  The seventh round is on its way.  Damn.  Pat, how are you?  One pussy coming.  All of a sudden, you're slamming them with the rest of us now.  Hey, what do you want me to say, man?  Ooh.  Wow.  There's a rivalry.  How about I drink yours, too?  I don't think I'll be able to handle it.  I don't know.  Side wager?  Dice and Ellis are going at it, Anthony.  There's nothing there between these two.  All right.  On the bell, guys.  The seventh round of eggnog will begin.  There's another minute gone.  Jesus.  A minute goes quick. 
[03:19:30]  I'm looking around the room.  Another round.  Pat is done.  Dice is done.  Matt's done.  Joe's done.  BJ's done.  John's done.  Steve's done.  No, Steve's still sipping.  Steve is.  Okay.  Now Steve's done.  Ellis is done.  And Doug.  Doug, how are you feeling from Arizona?  Fantastic.  You?  I don't have to drink this crap.  I'm doing it.  It's not affecting him yet.  No.  You think it's going to be a little higher than we anticipated, Opie?  I don't know.  No.  Or you think it'll kick in?  No.  BJ's already shaking his head.  No way.  Or you think it's going to kick in, like, quickly, where it's going to turn around? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  It's going to hit you.  Absolutely.  BJ is the smallest contestant.  I think he's in risk of getting out very early in the competition.  Smallest contestant in this batch doesn't mean you're small either.  Believe me.  We're just talking about it.  I'm the first one out before Ellis.  That really sucks.  Right?  You don't want to lose to Ellis.  I'm kind of scared.  I'm beginning to smell like a puke smell coming from this dude right here.  Remember the little chick that always wins the Nathan Hot Dog Contest?  Yeah.  True.  I guess.  You know.  All right.  Thank you, Club Soda Kenny.  Brilliant, as always.  There it is.  Here comes the eighth round, Anthony. 
[03:20:30]  Eighth round.  This is eight double shots of eggnog.  Most of the guys having no problem still.  Joe making a lot of faces, though.  Yeah, there was like a chunk of I don't know what in that one.  Well, the eggnog's getting clumpier.  It's been warming up all morning.  Yeah.  Now, eight of these two-ounce shots would make it 16 ounces.  That's right.  Anyone feeling anything they want to talk about?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  You guys all good still?  There's another carton gone. 
[03:21:00]  You all right?  Did anybody get the stalker patty pubes?  No, that was a toenail.  No one's having any problems.  Joe, you look like you're having problems.  No, no, I'm good.  I'm good.  Maybe it's strategy.  Maybe he's playing possum, Anthony.  Playing possum.  It's like poker.  That's true.  All right.  He could lay back, make people think he's injured.  Ellis, you all right?  With the small stomach?  Okay.  I cannot possibly see how he's doing that.  All right.  Here we go.  We're just shitting his pants.  And there it is.  And we're up to the ninth round of eggnog. 
[03:21:30]  I'm trying to get a line on how they're feeling by the way they drink these down.  Yeah.  Steve's taking his slow approach or slower approach.  Ellis kind of having a little more trouble washing this one down?  No?  No.  Just the taste.  He's making it.  Just the taste is kind of snotty.  Well, maybe not the taste.  The consistency is kind of like a viscous, you know?  Yes.  Very thick.  Smooth.  Very thick and viscous.  Yeah.  Like grease and oil.  Yeah.  All right.  Ellis is the only one.  Oh, Ellis and Steve. 
[03:22:00]  They're starting to slow down a little bit.  Yep.  Steve, you all right?  I'm all right.  I'm fine.  All right.  Steve finished up his knife.  And the cups get refilled.  Double shot of eggnog.  Ellis, you're done?  I'm done.  Okay.  Ellis is done, too.  These guys are all East Coast drunks.  You're not going to get anybody puking on 10.  It's going to be a little while before these guys puke.  Yeah, but it's a lot different than being out drinking some real fun booze.  This is thick, creamy, nauseating, heavy, heavy.  Did I say thick?  Yes, you did.  And creamy.  There it is.  Number 10. 
[03:22:30]  Here goes number 10.  We thought we'd be seeing a reaction by 10.  Looking around the room.  Anthony, Pat's done.  Dice is done.  Matt's done.  Joe's done.  Wow.  BJ's slowing down a little bit, but he just completed.  John, and of course, Steve and Ellis taking their time once again.  Steve taking their time.  And Doug from Arizona having no problem so far.  Ellis is starting to swish it around in his mouth, like hold it in his mouth a little  bit.  That's not a good sign.  I think I found my talent.  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  Well, there's a resume stuffer.  That's a good one.  Pat's definitely the one to beat right here.  He has the eye of the tiger. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, definitely.  He's enjoying it.  It's like the eye of the tiger and the stomach of a rhino.  Did I mention my diabetes?  I mentioned my diabetes.  What an ass.  And John, I saw you shaking your head like you were shaking off a punch after that last  cup.  Just letting it all just drip down the gullet a little bit.  You ever see a boxer get hit and he kind of goes, you know, shakes it off?  I saw him doing that.  Yeah, it's getting a little more interesting.  A little bit.  I think we're going to get to 20, no problem, and then it's going to just get 20.  It won't be no problem.  We're only on 10 now.  There it is. 
[03:23:30]  This is the 11th round, Anthony.  That's all the eggnog we got?  John looks like Brother Joe with Down Syndrome.  Are we going to run out of eggnog?  If we're going to run out of eggnog, someone better go get some now.  Like pronto.  That would ruin the contest.  We only have two.  Six.  We only have six.  How many have we been through?  Three gallons, and I'm not sure how many we've been through yet.  Where can we get eggnog?  Somebody better go right now.  Oh, my God.  Just in case.  Underestimation of the eggnog supply?  Just in case. 
[03:24:00]  Perhaps.  All right, Anthony.  What?  This is the 11th round.  How's everyone doing?  I was studying the eggnog in the cooler.  Very good.  I like how you jumped on that, though, Opie, and you saw maybe a dilemma developing.  I saw Nathaniel to my left panicking, going, we're going through this very fast.  Yeah.  I'll be bringing in a different one, and if we switch brands of eggnog, is that going  to affect people?  No, it won't.  All right.  Everyone get their 11th round down?  Steve is slowing way down, dude.  Wow, Steve hasn't even finished it.  Steve, you might be out.  Steve, did you finish? 
[03:24:30]  Drink, drink.  No?  Is he out?  I don't know if we made that one of our rules, did we?  Well, you have a minute to drink every round.  He's got to finish this up.  All right, from now on, if you don't finish by the time the next round starts, you're out.  Steve barely made it.  I don't think we made that clear.  All right, so now we're up to the 12th round, Anthony.  I know, Steve is sounding like Frankie Blue.  No problem, baby.  And there's no alcohol in this eggnog, but it affects you the same way.  Steve, you had a problem with that last cup.  Please let us know what's going on.  You're not drinking this one. 
[03:25:00]  Eric, get over there.  Steve, get over there.  Yeah.  Pay attention.  I'm all right.  You're all right?  Well, you have 25 seconds to finish that one up.  Get it down.  Get that thick beverage down, that thick, heavy beverage.  Uh-oh.  That's fine.  Has everyone else finished?  Swallow that thick beverage.  15 seconds, Steve.  Everyone else finished, right?  Filled with sugar.  You can do it.  10 seconds, Steve.  Steve?  Come on, Steve.  Five seconds, Steve.  Wash it down.  Oh!  He's still in, but barely.  He's on.  And pick up another one, Steve. 
[03:25:30]  Is Ellis out?  I can't take any more down.  A small stomach Ellis is out, Anthony.  Ellis is out.  Let's say goodbye to Ellis.  Thank you, Ellis.  He was great coming up here, guys.  He was the wrong shot in this contest with his little pea stomach.  So, uh, we wish him good luck.  Our first contestant is out.  He couldn't handle any more eggnog.  Now beat it, Raisin Belly.  We're in the middle of the 13th round, Anthony.  I'm on my way, too, guys.  Huh?  What?  I'm on my way, too.  Go ahead, Steve.  Come on, Steve.  Chug it.  Come on.  We've got 30 seconds left.  Come on, Steve.  Come on.  Take it like it's the load of an uncle. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, we don't want you bowing out without finishing.  You've got to at least give it a shot.  We want to see some puking, man.  He can't get a puke.  He'll be fine.  All right.  You've got 20 seconds.  Everyone else finished their round, right?  Come on.  All right.  Here goes Steve.  Come on.  Take that cup of liquid snot.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on, Steve.  Give it a shot.  Thick and creamy.  Come on, Steve.  10 seconds to get the 13th shot of eggnog down.  Uh-oh.  He's having some trouble.  Come on, Steve.  Five seconds.  Five, four, three, two.  He can't do it.  He's out. 
[03:26:30]  He is out.  And the 14th round started.  Now it's going to be interesting, Anthony.  Now, Steve, you've got to spin it in a circle.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, guys, for letting me come on.  Thank you, Steve.  There he goes.  We'll see you after the contest, but we just want to clear the studio out.  Oh.  Oh, burned.  Anthony, this is for the MiFi.  We're down to eight contestants.  We're in the 14th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  What's going on?  We lost two in a row.  What's going on?  We lost two in a row.  So, everyone else.  I've been concentrating on those two that have just been knocked out of the competition. 
[03:27:00]  Haven't really given any attention to the other guys.  How are we feeling?  Fine.  Good.  Everyone else is fine.  Wait, everyone drank their 14th like nothing?  Yep.  Ugh.  Wow.  We're just sitting here waiting for the 15th round to start.  It doesn't affect you guys that two guys are out now?  They don't care.  It's good.  It just motivates us.  It motivates you.  It doesn't make you think, wow, a few more shots and it's going to get ugly here.  That too.  All right.  Wow.  There's a cheering section outside of the window holding up signs now.  Great.  I got fans.  Big boys. 
[03:27:30]  And the 15th round starts.  Go, Pat.  And then another sign.  Hope you puke.  We only have seven contestants?  I don't know.  Didn't we start with ten?  Oh, we started with nine.  Okay.  I don't know, Opie.  All right.  I just started thinking of Foster's ear.  What?  Oh, we had a spot for the guy from Maine.  Fuck him.  All right.  This is the 15th round, Anthony.  Seems the eggnog is draining any humor that might have been in these guys.  Jesus. 
[03:28:00]  Dice, how are you feeling over there?  Feeling fine.  Feeling fine.  Okay.  Pat, you all right?  Piece of cake?  I don't even notice it yet.  Uh-oh.  I'll go a couple more hours.  A couple more hours.  All right.  Yeah, he can.  Everyone got their fifth.  BJ's still in the contest, Ant.  BJ, yeah.  He was thought to have been one of the long shots.  But he's standing too stiff.  BJ's not happy right now.  He's standing too relaxed.  He really wants to vomit.  I was surprised to see Steve out so early.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's a big guy.  Do good.  I knew that an old change purse stomach was going to have trouble. 
[03:28:30]  But we're up to the 16th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  John slammed his.  Doug from Arizona slammed his.  Going around the room.  Everyone's still having no problem.  John, how are you feeling?  You're rubbing your belly.  You're rubbing your belly.  Just massaging it in there.  All right.  It's good.  I'm getting close, I think.  I hope not.  BJ's getting close.  Now, what makes you think you're getting close?  I want to know what the feeling is. 
[03:29:00]  I don't know.  Bloat?  Kind of, yeah.  Yeah, but the thing is, like, the other two, they just quit.  I'm going to keep drinking until I puke my wrist.  Jimmy, did you see your pants?  That's what we want to hear today.  Somebody just shit their pants.  I don't know if that's strategy or something, but it is horrific.  It wasn't a fart over there.  Who the F farted?  Kenny, is it you?  That was my big announcement.  All right, well, Anthony, it stinks in the studio. 
[03:29:30]  There it is, guys.  Another one.  17th round in the eggnog drinking contest.  17th.  And John just slamming it.  Pat slammed his.  Doug from Arizona.  A little slow, but he got down.  A little slower than before.  And BJ still in the competition.  Everyone done?  John?  Who's kill?  Or eggnog?  They better hurry up.  No.  How are we doing on eggnog supply?  How many left?  Three over there.  How many over there?  How many over there?  We should be all right for now until we get more.  Two left over here.  They're going to buy too many now. 
[03:30:00]  They're going to bring back 30.  Oh, we're going to have like 800 things of eggnog over here.  Guys, any, Matt, how are you doing?  It's filling up, but it's, yeah, just make a little more room.  Making a little more room.  Oh, my God.  I like his flaming shirt.  I like Steve.  BJ's closing his eyes, Anthony, and concentrating.  Is it a concentrating move,  or is it like I'm going to puke move?  It's a concentrating move,  trying to ignore that little sharp pain in my stomach right now.  And 18. 
[03:30:30]  There we go.  It's going to be a little hard to ignore when you're drinking a little more.  Here we go.  The 18th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat's just slamming.  Wow.  Pat's unbeatable.  What does Dice have to say about that, though?  Dice?  I think it's me and Pat at the end.  Really?  You're having no problem?  Dice and Pat having no problem.  I'm a Long Island Elkie.  What do you expect?  Matt having a little bit of a problem.  Joe just making a lot of faces.  I don't know what that means, Anthony.  But he seems to be putting it down okay.  BJ?  I got a few more rounds left in me,  and if he doesn't show any cracks, it's his. 
[03:31:00]  No, no.  You got it.  I mean, we need to see some puke, man.  You got to take one for the team.  BJ?  His stomach's pretty full.  Oh, you're fine, BJ.  Yeah, he's...  Sure.  Wait, did you finish your last one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So everyone finished it?  18th round is done.  Doug, how are you feeling over there from Arizona?  I'm going until I vomit.  All right.  It's the Arizona spirit.  Who's cheating?  I was figuring out quick.  You were what?  Grab number nine.  Fuck it.  Go with nine.  Oh, they're mixing up each other. 
[03:31:30]  All right, here we go.  19th round has begun.  You could be drinking somebody else's backwash.  In the eggnog drinking contest.  Someone is...  The notes are going up on the window.  Do it for Connor, BJ.  Because I hope you puke on the window,  and big boys rule, go Pat.  I think...  BJ's ready to puke.  Eric was a little alarmed that Joe was having a problem.  Did he gag a little?  It was a little...  A little reflex.  A little...  Ah, a little trouble getting that one down, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, you have 30 seconds. 
[03:32:00]  BJ's going to puke soon.  This may be it, this one.  Nah, you'll be fine, BJ.  Come on, BJ.  Well, he got that down, right?  BJ's face is looking a little different than earlier.  That festive, I'm here having fun look.  Gone from his face.  It's been replaced by a,  holy shit, I'm going to vomit look.  That determined, I will not puke.  You know that look you get when you're fucked up,  and you know you're going to vomit?  I'm not going to puke, man.  Not this time.  You're fine, dude.  You're fine.  I just got to get through my radio shift.  Kenny.  Baby. 
[03:32:30]  And...  20th round has begun in the eggnog drinking contest.  Kenny, you can let the girls and stuff in.  We have more room in the studio.  Yeah.  More eggnog, please.  Oh, wow.  Uh-oh, BJ.  BJ, you're fine.  Take it down.  All eyes are on BJ.  Oh, his glasses are coming off.  He took his glasses off.  Uh-oh.  I don't want them falling in.  He doesn't want them falling in the...  You got 45 seconds.  In the fell as he pukes.  Come on, BJ.  Plenty of time, BJ.  BJ.  BJ.  Oh!  Wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  There it is.  There it is.  Should I finish this so I can puke more?  Yeah, you can.  Go ahead, BJ.  Sure, you got 20 seconds.  Everyone else finished the 20th round.  BJ, we're going to have to say goodbye to BJ.  Like a champ, he's finishing up the 20th.  Oh, wow.  What a fucking good sport he is.  What a good egg.  What a trooper, man.  Let's hear it for BJ.  Whackbag.com.  Whackbag.com, yes.  Our first vomit release.  That was a pretty puke. 
[03:33:30]  That was a good one.  Here it is.  Uh-oh, Joe.  You drank it down, right, Joe?  You're all right.  Joe just drank it down.  He's holding the edges of the bucket and leaning over a little and bouncing.  Was that his 20th or the 21st?  That was 20th.  Whatever we're up to.  Joe's fine.  Oh, so Joe still has to do the 21st.  No, no.  Joe just did that right down.  No, that was fine.  He sucked that one right down.  Okay.  You can't make him spin in a circle after every shot.  How nice of this.  Whoa.  All right.  We're down.  BJ's still puking out there.  Is he?  He's going, oh, that was cool. 
[03:34:00]  Thank you, Club Soda County.  All right.  What did Jimmy Norton just do?  Did you get that on tape?  I went to look out the window, and I fucking forgot that the glass comes in.  I just smashed my head on it.  It's double-paned with about a foot and a half in between, and he thought it was the far window,  so he went to look out it and smashed his head.  Oh, no.  Did he puke?  Yes, he did.  Did you puke?  Yeah.  I just want to come out. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, Joe is out.  Joe is out.  And we're ready to drink more.  Punch out, Margaret.  Wow.  Joe puked.  All right.  Joe puked.  The 22nd round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Oh, no.  Why don't we move the contestants into the center so we know who's who now?  We've got Doug from Arizona.  We've got John still in the contest.  We've got Matt, Dice, and Pat.  Wow.  We're down to the last five, Anthony.  We have had two puking losses.  That's a good sign for me.  This is for the MiFi, the portable XM satellite radio.  The wall.  She can't ring us on.  Which one? 
[03:35:00]  The shit dicks are behind you, Dice.  Yeah.  All right.  It's classic.  They're putting up signs as the contest continues.  Look at that smudge your head left on the window, Jim.  I know.  It's a little grease mark.  That big spot on the window where you clocked your head.  Eric, everyone get their 20-second shot down?  Yep.  Okay.  Yep.  We're coming up on, what, 10 seconds left before the next one.  Nope.  They're all good.  Two people out by puking.  Two more out by just saying they've had it.  And we have five seconds left before the next shot, guys.  Here it comes. 
[03:35:30]  And we're up to the 23rd round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat putting that one down like he put down his first, Opie.  He does not seem to care.  I'm getting a good whiff of a puke in a garbage can.  How is it?  It's great.  It's beautiful.  Uh-oh.  Ice and creamy.  Doug from Arizona having a little problem.  He came a long way, Anthony.  Come on, Doug.  Think of all the egg yolks.  We're going to have to eat oatmeal for a week to get our cholesterol back down.  Probably a month.  You talk on shit and you bring up cholesterol.  That's true.  Wait, what, Dice? 
[03:36:00]  Who brings up cholesterol when they're trying to talk shit?  That's a good point.  It's hard to throw this.  It's like, oh, go have a piece of bacon.  Your cholesterol will get higher today.  That was just fucking stupid.  Doug is just sipping, Anthony.  I don't think he's going to make it.  No, he's not going to make it.  Come on, Doug.  We've got 15 seconds left, Doug.  Doug said he'll drink until he pukes.  Doug from Arizona is still in, Anthony.  What a trooper.  He's still in.  Drinking like one of those Arizona Indians.  Nothing?  They prefer Native Americans.  Wait, is everyone in? 
[03:36:30]  Matt and I make this one.  Matt's got, no.  Matt's fine.  That's right, drink it down.  Wait, is he one behind?  No, he's on.  No, he's on.  Oh, okay.  Okay, I thought he was behind.  All right, so this is the 24th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  And Matt looks like he's filling up.  It's good between Doug and Matt.  Bowling out next, I think.  Doug has a full cup left.  It's been 20 seconds.  It's been 20 seconds.  Come on, Doug, you can do it.  And to this round, he hasn't taken a sip.  There's his first sip.  Doug, you flew all the way from Arizona on JetBlue, man. 
[03:37:00]  Think about the motion of that plane.  Turbulence.  30 seconds, Doug.  25 seconds, Doug.  The smell of a bad pussy.  He is trying, man.  Wash his ears.  Yeah.  A little rough.  Someone's scraping their tongue and holding it under your nose.  He's 15 seconds.  15 seconds, Anthony.  He's fine.  There's the end of the beat.  Just suck it.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that was as close as you could come to puking.  You got five seconds, my friend.  Come on, Doug.  Come on, Doug.  Five seconds.  Come on. 
[03:37:30]  Slam it.  Slam it.  Slam it.  Slam it down.  You got it.  Yeah, he just made it, Anthony.  There it is.  Just made it.  And just in time to do another.  The 25th round.  Oh!  What a puking guy.  Matt has puked.  And he's shaking.  Matt is out.  He's shaking like a dog and it's flying everywhere.  Matt is out.  Matt is out of the contest.  Just couldn't do it.  Wow.  Couldn't do it.  Let's hear it for Matt.  My suggestion for the next contest. 
[03:38:00]  Get a wider garbage.  Man, his puke went kind of flying all over the place.  Oh, my God.  It was like a scene out of Turner and Hooch.  That's exactly it.  He's shaking his head and vomits flying.  Uh-oh.  Doug's got a problem again, Anthony.  Doug's got 20 seconds left and he's got almost a full cup there.  Come on, Doug.  You flew in for a drink.  Wait.  And I'm also noticing Dice doesn't have a.  All right.  He's getting it down.  No, Dice went with 10 seconds left.  Yeah, Dice went with some strategy.  He waited until the last minute.  Oh, Doug is bowing out.  Doug, you're bowing out.  I'm puking. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, and that's it.  That's it.  We got a gag out of Doug.  Dice is having problems.  He's having problems.  Dice is having problems now.  Please.  I think Matt puking right next to Dice was a little bit of a problem for Dice.  All right.  We got Dice, Pat, and John left in the contest.  There's only three guys left.  Dice, you got 45 seconds and a full glass.  You haven't touched it yet.  What are you thinking?  Absolutely nothing.  All right.  He's having some trouble.  No, he's fine.  He's fine.  Uh-oh. 
[03:39:00]  Wait.  Is he putting it down?  Yep.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Why don't you at least hold your cup so you can finish it if you feel the urge?  Dice, you have 25 seconds left.  I don't know.  It's for the my five.  Everyone is moving away from Dice.  Come on, Dice.  You just got to wolf it.  Here he goes.  You just got to shoot that down.  It's not going to get you sick.  Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice.  Dice is still in, Anthony.  You finished it.  Nice.  It's Pat, Dice, and John.  You finished, John?  I haven't heard that chant for 10 years. 
[03:39:30]  And bang.  There's another.  Pat washing it right down.  Oh!  Was that a puke?  Oh, yes, it was.  Oh, yeah.  It was a power boot.  God damn.  Dice is out in the 27th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Dice, good job, though.  Wow.  Let's hear it for Dice.  I'm going to bow out gracefully.  Very good.  There he goes, Dice.  Made a great effort, Anthony.  It is down to John and Pat. 
[03:40:00]  John and Pat have done their shots already?  They both get a garbage pail.  The first guy to puke loses, obviously, and the other guy gets the MiFi.  We're just down to these two.  The portable X on satellite radio.  This is it.  Wow.  Here we go.  Guys, how are you both feeling?  Good enough?  Were you confident that you could win this?  I'm winning.  And Pat?  I'm fine.  Pat is fine.  That's totally fine.  That's a big fuck, man.  Pat came in second place on our last The Cherry Darts competition.  Just missed winning a MiFi.  This time, I mean, he's hell-bent.  The comeback.  He is confident he's winning this. 
[03:40:30]  And ding.  28th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Straight psycho arms.  Pat just knocks it right back.  John.  Pat.  Very quick second.  Pat.  More eggnog.  Yay.  We don't need that much.  That's all right.  We had to make sure.  We don't need that much, Danny.  That's funny.  Danny, we didn't need more eggnog.  John, you got it down, right?  All right.  They both got it down.  That's all down.  They have their next shot in their hands already.  Hold on.  Man, interesting.  How many more shots you guys think you could do?  How many you got? 
[03:41:00]  Pat's feeling no ill effects from this whatsoever.  It might be striking.  Just another day for me.  John, are you feeling any ill effects?  I'm definitely feeling it, but I can keep going.  I think he's playing possum.  He's hurting.  You think he's hurting a little bit?  He's hurting.  All right.  And, John, where are you from again?  Connecticut.  Connecticut.  And Pat's from?  Munaki.  Munaki.  Jersey and Connecticut.  Jersey.  I got diabetes, but I got nine more toes.  Oh, wow.  That wasn't bad, though.  I like him.  He takes a lot of practice swings. 
[03:41:30]  And, guys, look what time it is.  29.  This is how many shots Jim from PA, who's on the phone, thought the winner would do without  puking, by the way.  Wow.  Pat knocks it right back.  John, a little slower drinking than Pat.  Yeah.  Not as big.  It's like a two-gulp thing, three maybe.  And then Pat just knocks this back like it's nothing.  I have not yet begun to drink.  Wow.  All right.  What was that?  29.  That was 29.  That was 29.  We're coming up on our 30th shot. 
[03:42:00]  That is 60 ounces of creamy, thick, viscous, land-o-lakes eggnog.  When Pat's walking down the street, people just point at him and say, there's Pat, the  best there's ever been.  Great.  All right.  We're just kind of waiting.  Pat letting off a little steam.  I'm running from Mount Vesuvius.  And John has a posture to him that looks a little uncomfortable. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, he's not moving.  As we start the 30th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  30 double shots of eggnog, Anthony.  Two gulps for Pat.  I'm in the mood for some eggnog.  Thank you.  He just takes that other cup.  Good day to you, sir.  You know, it really makes you appreciate the athleticism of these two when you see how easily  the others were knocked out.  That's the difference between the people that came and might have thought they had a chance 
[03:43:00]  and the true champions in eggnog drinking, Opie.  I'm really amazed that these guys are so above and beyond the guys that have been counted  out.  Pat?  And I didn't think I'd accomplish anything in life but this.  John?  All right.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I'm rooting for you.  I'm getting there.  Don't let this big fuck beat you.  I'm not done yet.  I'm not done yet.  Not done.  Here we go, Anthony. 
[03:43:30]  We're just about ready for the 31st round in the eggnog drinking contest.  You know, I like Pat, but I would like him to be the Susan Lucci of my fies, you know?  Where he's always in it but just can't seem to pull it off kind of thing.  They both got it down pretty easily.  The Buffalo Bills of my fie.  A lot of burping going on.  Size 14.  Size 14.  Size 14.  We haven't played that in a while.  Need some help, would you?  Would you?  Would you? 
[03:44:00]  Would you?  Pat?  I got nothing.  It puts the eggnog in its belly.  Does this every minute.  She spilled my eggnog.  This is like the lull before the storm, Anthony.  They're just piling up, aren't they?  Oh, it's the Autobahn in the fog.  All right.  Oh, God.  John, head tilted slightly askew.  He's bent over a little.  Is it hard for you to stand up completely straight now? 
[03:44:30]  I think Pat has him psyched out.  He might.  All right.  It's the 32nd round in the eggnog drinking contest.  Aaron from Texas.  This is what he thought the winner would do without puking, by the way.  Wow.  And right in the hand.  No problem, John?  It's getting there.  It's getting percolating.  Come on, John.  Hang in there.  Hang in there, John.  Are either of you getting a nauseous feeling?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I'm just starting.  No, just starting to drink.  Right, right. 
[03:45:00]  Mmm, that's going to be a tough one.  Holy shit.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Texas real fast.  Aaron.  Yeah.  They did 32 shots, no problem.  Yes?  Yes.  That's too much damn eggnog.  I know.  Well, the next guy, Jim from Illinois, can we get him on the line?  Any of these guys on the line or no?  He said that the winner would do 33 shots without puking.  Looks like Steve's closet on TV.  Yeah, the big fire on the parkway.  All right, Anthony. 
[03:45:30]  Yes.  A little while in the action, but we're just about ready for the 33rd round of the eggnog  drinking contest.  There it is.  Oh, my gosh.  Yummy.  That is just not even waiting.  Pat just chugs it right.  I hate Pat.  Pat, how are you feeling?  Fine.  John?  He is built for this, John.  Yeah.  I might have to give it to him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  John.  No, John.  John.  John.  John.  John.  Come on.  Come on, John. 
[03:46:00]  I finished my last one.  I can try another.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Pat has to be feeling confident.  You've got to be feeling confident, Pat.  Yes, I am.  This could be a scenario where Pat is like the Yankees and John is like the Red Sox.  You count him out.  You think it's all over.  Looks pretty much a done deal.  Jim?  Yeah?  From Illinois.  You might be out.  They both did 33 shots.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  One more.  Come on, guys.  One more.  And here we go. 
[03:46:30]  We're just about ready to start the 34th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Jared, by the way, from Maine, who hates Ben, he said that the winner would do 35 shots.  He might be right on.  Maybe.  Pat, no problem once again.  Pat, just putting it right down.  John, have it up.  Come on, John.  You have 50 seconds.  You're fine.  Come on, John.  There you go.  You're fine.  There it is.  No problem, John.  John just put another one down.  It's really a little tough.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Serious XM.  12 months of celebrities.

[03:51:30]  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is Iraq, Iraq Radio on Twitter as I shamelessly plug my social media outlets.  And because of Twitter, you're listening to the 2004 Eggnog Drinking Challenge.  This is the original Eggnog Drinking Challenge when we came to XM Satellite Radio.  And somebody reached out to me on Twitter saying, hey, you never play this one.  You always play the one that features the baby bird.  We want to hear where it all started. 
[03:52:00]  Well, this is it.  We're going into part two of the original Eggnog Drinking Challenge from 2004.  Here's part two.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  We're getting close to the 35th round of the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  Jared from Maine.  What's up, Jared?  John not picking up the cup after his...  I think it's coming.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  You can do it.  Jared.  Oh, boy.  Oh! 
[03:52:30]  Hold on.  Hello.  Another volley.  Another volley of vomit.  Oh!  Another third volley of vomit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the humanity.  Oh, my God.  Power booting.  Power booting.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  I am speechless.  Time for another shot.  And Pat wins and puts another one down.  More.  More. 
[03:53:00]  More.  Pat.  Unbelievable.  Pat.  John.  Let's hear it for John.  Wow.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  And Pat's drinking another one.  Wait, how many are you up to?  Let's see how many you can do.  More.  More.  How many was that?  37.  That was two after.  37.  37.  This is my victory lap.  All right, let's just keep...  Jared, guess what?  You won the other MyFive.  We'll talk to you in a minute here.  But first, let's say hi to...  Say hi.  Let's say bye to John, I guess. 
[03:53:30]  John.  John.  What a great effort.  Three powerful fire hose boofs into that garbage pail.  It was stunning, wasn't it?  It was the first one.  Just this powerful fire hose-like nozzle spray of puke.  And then, bam, another.  And then, bam, another.  The worst part was I farted during each one, too.  Did you?  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Cheers, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  John.  HappyAnthony.net.  Thanks. 
[03:54:00]  HappyAnthony.net.  What a great message board.  What an effort.  There he goes.  John, you represented well today, buddy.  And Pat.  Hey, John, John.  Drinking another one.  Oh, nailed him.  Now, just for the hell of it.  We're going to see how many shots Pat can do here.  Except for 38.  He might finish every single one.  39.  39.  Keep filling him up.  Yeah, let's just keep filling him up.  I'm a little thirsty.  Let's watch the fat guy puke.  He's like, I'm a little thirsty.  You've got to give him the minute, though.  You've got to give him the time, right?  Why?  Okay.  Now he's just putting him down like a madman. 
[03:54:30]  Does somebody have a blood glucose meter on him?  All right.  You can do it at your pace.  I am at my pace.  You're up to what?  40?  This is 41.  40.  He doesn't want a diabetic.  Come on now.  41.  You've got to stop.  50's a nice even number.  All right.  Let's go for 50.  We'll go for 50.  We're at 41.  You're not really diabetic, are you?  Yeah.  Oh.  God, if he loses a leg, he gets a my-fi and a prosthetic.  We could call this the Mabel King commemorative contest. 
[03:55:00]  There goes 42.  Ah.  That was a little warm.  Uh-oh.  That's the first even hint of a complaint I've heard from Pat.  Yeah.  Could be the turning point.  I do feel my stomach going up into my ribs a little bit.  We just want to set the bar for future contests.  Yeah.  43.  Pat's the heavyweight champion.  What do you got?  This is 40 what?  43.  43 going down.  Well, you're drinking it so fast.  43 double shots of eggnog, Anthony. 
[03:55:30]  Wow.  No, I know.  What are you thinking, Pat?  It won't be accurate, but I'm thinking I can't wait for breakfast.  All right.  Here goes 44.  Oh.  Yeah?  Anything?  You're looking a little different, though.  A bit peaked.  Yeah.  Well, I'm a winner now.  You won a Wi-Fi.  Yeah.  Great if he throws up on it.  Yeah.  His shorts out.  Sparks flying out of it. 
[03:56:00]  Puke.  He's digging eggnog out of it for six months.  How many is that, Eric?  This is 45.  45 double shots of eggnog.  Scraping puke.  Off the display.  Yeah.  You know that nice new smell of electronics has ruined his vile stomach?  This is 46.  46.  46.  Double shots of eggnog.  All right.  You got to get to 50.  Hey, I can pick up your tree.  I got a nice big van. 
[03:56:30]  Everything out of this guy.  47.  47, Anthony.  47.  He's done 12 since the contest ended.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Where am I at?  This is 48.  48.  Two more left, and we'll just call it.  No.  I think he's going to keep calling it.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  Till what?  He won't be able to go.  Till what?  It's up to...  This is 49.  Past 50.  No way.  He's got to go past 50.  Because if he pukes, then he's actually doing himself a favor. 
[03:57:00]  He'll get all of it out of him.  This is number 50.  I don't think he's going to puke.  No, he won't.  I don't think he...  It has to.  It doesn't bother him.  He's superhuman.  That's 50?  How does 50 feel?  50 feels like victory.  Just keep going, man.  Out of curiosity, I want to say...  51.  51.  In my curiosity?  I hope he would be great in the Third Reich. 
[03:57:30]  No, keep putting these spikes in his head.  Let's see how long it takes for him to pass out.  Sew her legs together while she gives birth.  52.  52?  Pat, what do you think?  I'm slowing down.  All right, good.  Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat.  He's slowing down.  No, he isn't.  He just sucked that one right down.  And I started my diet today.  Jesus, Harry Chapin. 
[03:58:00]  53.  53.  53.  Uh-oh.  Someone's got to figure out how many calories he's done.  Wow, yeah.  How many calories?  Well...  What did you have to do with the last thing?  It only goes up to eight digits.  Uh-oh.  Did you just kind of...  Yeah, he's starting to gurgle.  Cracking.  Eric, what are we up to?  This is 54.  54.  Jesus.  He's making everyone else look like a bunch of pussies.  Oh, he laughs at them.  Pat laughs at them.  Isn't he double what some of the guys were out at? 
[03:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  Way.  Pat?  His hands are in his pockets.  He's getting uncomfortable.  Okay, yeah.  It's uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable.  All right.  Yeah.  You want to keep going, Pat?  I'll have a couple more.  Yeah, why not?  55.  Have one for the road.  You'll probably crash soon.  I'm going to put windshield wipers on the inside of my windshield.  Spray on that button, you son of a bitch.  What is this now?  This is 55.  55.  All right.  Every one.  Kenny, what do you think?  I think that's good for me. 
[03:59:00]  I'm not standing nowhere near him, because when he lets loose, it's going to go across  the studio.  I think it could hit the back window behind Anthony.  Just think of the pressure that stomach's under.  It is.  It's like a big rubber bag, all stretched, waiting to squeeze it out at hypervelocity.  He's going to puke.  It's going to keep blacks out of a college in 1964.  I'm just going to roll him out to the sidewalk.  Let's turn the lights back on.  All right. 
[03:59:30]  50.  I think it's for Kenny.  This is 56.  I think he needs to get to 60.  56 is such a weird number.  Yeah, it is.  56.  I mean, what is that?  Pants?  Wow.  What's wrong, Pat?  You're fine.  I'm feeling a little full.  Of course you are.  A little full.  All right.  57.  Three more.  Starting to space out that garbage can.  No, you won't puke.  You have four more.  Oh, man.  You're fine.  We're all starting to like...  I'm starting to look around where I can duck.  It'll be after 60. 
[04:00:00]  What's that?  It'll be after 60.  Oh, cocky.  Oh, look at you being cocky.  58.  Have you ever drank as much eggnog before?  Martini Steve's in the studio.  He's figuring out how many calories with his little calculator.  What's he up to now?  57.  This is 58 right here.  And they're double shots, sweetie.  Right, right.  Yeah.  So how much is one, Steve?  One seven.  Multiply that by 57.  Thank you, Jim.  58 now.  58 now.  Just add...  Take 57 and add whatever...  Jim, can you stop, please?  All right, Pat. 
[04:00:30]  9,860 so far.  9,000.  Just about 10,000 calories.  This is number 59.  59, Pat.  He's really slowing down.  Yeah.  The face is looking a little different.  How are you feeling?  Getting ready to go.  One more.  Oh, boy.  All right, here's 60.  60.  That's the first one he hasn't shot.  No, it's really slow.  But he's also not doing it in a minute. 
[04:01:00]  He would probably do more if he had a minute in between each one.  Yeah, maybe.  Pat, what do you think?  Ready to go.  Pretty soon.  If you do 60, I think you could do 62.  Nah, 62.  Don't make him go up at 62.  62 is fine.  Yeah, 62.  Come on.  Have you ever drank...  This is 61.  Yeah, you could do two more, dude.  Yeah, two more, and then...  What are you, a gay?  What are you, a girl?  Come on.  Come on, eggnog dick.  Oh, he's really slowing down.  Yeah.  That's not done.  He didn't finish it. 
[04:01:30]  That's not done.  Yeah, you didn't finish that.  That's not done, kid.  What's wrong with you?  60 what?  61.  61?  62.  Oh, 62.  Yes.  He's like William Holden looking at the coffee table.  Oh, my God.  He just slammed 62.  Well, if you do 62, I think you could do what?  63, Jim?  I can't bend over to puke.  Uh-oh.  Someone's better light a fire over here.  Someone's better raise that fucking garbage can, man.  Look, dude.  If you did 62, you could do 63. 
[04:02:00]  I mean, come on.  It's only one more.  What do you think, Pat?  There has to be a grand finale.  Pat, almost 63.  Doubled.  Yeah, there has to be a grand finale.  You can't just walk out after 62.  It's such an odd number.  It really is.  All right.  Here goes Pat.  63.  Maybe he needs some encouragement, everyone, in the studio.  Let's go, Pat.  63.  Come on, Peele.  He's fine.  Pat, what do you think? 
[04:02:30]  He's fine.  There's no more room at the inn.  Wow.  Sold out?  All right.  What are we up to here?  This is 64.  64.  Done.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean, Pat?  You can't just walk out after 63 double shots.  65.  It's such a good number.  I'm going to explode.  You want a donut?  Oh, yeah.  This is going to be like from the Monty Python movie.  Waffer Thin.  Waffer Thin.  Waffer Thin.  Waffer Thin.  That's the right ta-ta, but the wrong ho-ho, Pat. 
[04:03:00]  Well, Pat, what do you think?  I'm getting gas pains now.  Uh-oh.  Gas pains?  Oh, please shit your pants.  All right.  64.  I mean, he's so close to 65.  65 is that number.  65 is his max.  He can't go over 65.  That's his max.  Yeah, I don't think.  I think he's a pussy.  He can't go over 65.  He certainly can.  No, he can't.  No, 65.  That's a fine number to stop at.  Oh, wow.  Hey, they're cheering outside.  They want 70.  70 is such an even number, I think. 
[04:03:30]  65.  Be happy with 65.  I don't know.  They want 70 outside.  The other contestants want 70.  Well, that's true.  BJ puked.  He's fine.  Yeah, BJ's fine.  Look at him.  He's smiling.  What is he up to, Eric?  This is 65.  65?  Only 65.  65 double shots of eggnog.  How many calories is he up to?  It's well over 10,000 now.  Yeah.  I'm thinking of the point where I have to make myself puke.  Uh-oh.  No.  Yeah, you might have to.  Yeah, you might have to.  You've got to get rid of that stuff.  11,050. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, no.  He has raised his two fingers, Anthony.  Do you want to do 66?  66.  66.  66.  66.  What do I win?  66.  You're going to puke it out.  The respect of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're the champ.  Here you go.  66.  Dude, you're raising the bar for a future contest here.  66 down.  66.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I have to make myself.  Yeah, you might have to make yourself.  You can't before 67.  I say you.  It's like a foul. 
[04:04:30]  It's going in, but it ain't coming out.  Pat, I say you do 70 and then you make yourself puke.  I think everyone would like to see that, right?  How about you done?  This is 67 right here.  67 double shots of eggnog.  Holy shit.  Only three more in this.  Only three more.  That's okay.  That was 67.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he's getting 20 pounds in front of our eyes, man.  All right.  Here comes 68.  68.  What are you thinking, man?  You're studying him.  I don't know what to think. 
[04:05:00]  68 double shots.  You're starting to sweat.  Just have him puke.  Well, no.  He's got to get to 70.  69.  No.  He's got to get to 70.  No.  I say stop.  He's got to get to 70.  You should stop him.  What do you want, Pat?  You want to walk away after 68 or?  It doesn't matter.  If he pukes, it's all coming out.  69.  69 done. 
[04:05:30]  70.  An even 70 shots.  That's it.  No more, dude.  No more.  Wow.  All right.  70 double shots.  Big dog from Pat.  You doubled what the other guy did.  From Monaki, New Jersey.  Representing.  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  He's in the trailer park.  What do you want to do?  I want a puke.  All right.  Then you better do that.  Why don't you lift those two fingers up?  He's lifting his two fingers up.  Oh, boy.  That's all right.  He's got to do it.  Here we go.  He's got three fingers in his mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  This is Pat from Monaki, Anthony.  This guy. 
[04:06:00]  That was just the warm-up.  That's two shots.  That's the warm-up.  That was a half-gallon on his side.  All right.  Everyone, listen.  Listen.  I'm a star.  Eric's running out. 
[04:06:30]  He's going to puke also.  Eric's car even.  Eric.  Come on.  No.  Eric's puking.  Eric's puking.  How much eggnog is coming out of this guy?  Wow.  I've never seen so much eggnog.  Get me a bucket.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, thank you.  I can't lift any harder. 
[04:07:00]  Oh, my God.  There's no way more is going to come out of this guy.  Is that it, Pat?  It's 12,000 calories.  He's still puking.  Bad day to start a diet. 
[04:07:30]  Maybe he can get his name to puke shop.  All done.  Oh, you're done?  Yeah.  Pat from Monocle, New Jersey.  Thank you.  Wow.  Was that a marathon puke?  How do you feel, man?  You all right?  I feel better now.  Of course.  Holy S.  He did 70 double shots of eggnog.  He got it out, too.  He got most of that out.  Oh, yeah.  That was a lot.  Well, Pat's pretty heavy.  That bucket's, like, swimming. 
[04:08:00]  Make Eric take that out.  I think Eric should have to carry that out.  Eric vomited.  Eric vomited.  How are you, Eric?  You can't speak.  Eric, take those buckets out.  Uh-oh.  Take that bucket out.  Eric.  Smell it.  Darren, get Eric on mic.  Eric, what's up?  No, no, no.  What's the matter?  I'm going to throw up.  No, you're not.  You're fine.  Smell that wonderful puke smell.  Just, Eric, be careful.  Listen to that slosh around in there, Eric. 
[04:08:30]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I was laughing so hard.  I couldn't breathe.  Hey, I'll give somebody 10 bucks to smell Pat's two fingers.  All right.  High five.  Oh, Kathy.  All right, Pat, congratulations.  You won the my five.  Thank you.  Oh, it does smell it.  Now I smell it.  Notice Ben hasn't been around.  Of course not.  Because Ben hates this stuff.  Where is he?  He's combing his hair with a hammer.  I thought it was puke and fucking, my friend is behind him from the sticker.  It does reek in here now.  That was 4.3 gallons at 12,000 calories. 
[04:09:00]  Nice.  You're turning 4.3.  Not gallons.  4.3 gallons.  You sure?  Yeah.  4 ounces per cup.  70 cups.  4 ounces per cup.  Do some more math, Steve.  Okay.  I thought it was 2 ounces per cup.  It should be about 2 ounces.  Two shots.  There's no way the guy did 4.3 gallons.  You know, Steve.  Even 2 gallons would be crazy.  It's 2 shots.  2 shots. 
[04:09:30]  2 gallons.  Maybe it's 2 gallons, but it's still 12,000 calories.  A little over 2 gallons of eggnog from Pat.  All right, Pat.  We got to give him something extra for doing all this.  He did an extra 35 shots.  He certainly did.  I don't know what we can give him.  We'll give him a t-shirt or something.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we get everyone out of the studio?  Pat is the winner of the eggnog drinking contest.  Congratulations.  Pat, any parting words?  Pat?  Parting words?  Yeah, Pat.  What do you want to say?  You won?  I feel like the biggest loser. 
[04:10:00]  Oh, geez.  Thank you, Pat.  Thank you.  Great job, Mike.  Pete from Connecticut Online.  Yes, Pete.  Yeah, I do.  I'm going to mind if I get 27 awful jokes by the end of the eggnog.  27 awful Pat jokes.  Very good.  Thank you, Pete.  Pete from Connecticut.  Let's say hi to Eric in New York City.  Eric, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Good morning there, sweet tit.  Hi there, Angel.  I have a good puke story for you.  All right.  I'm three months into dating my girlfriend. 
[04:10:30]  And I'm trying to get laid and get invited to a wedding.  Get really drunk.  Where are you calling from?  A nuclear reactor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to cut our losses there.  Brian from Long Island.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Syndication how?  Hey, I just wanted to say 70 shots, too.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Yeah, it was definitely insane.  I cannot believe the guy just did 70 double shots of eggnog. 
[04:11:00]  Hey, where's Jared?  Remember Jared?  Oh, yeah.  Who hates Ben?  He ends up winning the other MiFi.  He guessed.  He was closest to how many shots?  40, right?  I think he was right on the button.  He said 35, I think.  Yep.  35.  He did win.  He did win.  Oh, my God.  Jared, give us a call back.  You won the other MiFi today.  That's funny.  Watching him stick his whole fist down his throat like that and just gurgling.  It's probably better for him than he puked up.  Oh, yeah.  That's why I wanted him to keep going.  Because if that's settled in, I think he's going to have major problems later today. 
[04:11:30]  I was actually getting worried about him.  I'm like, dude, he's diabetic, man.  I don't want to see the guy.  Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle.  How funny it would have been if he went into diabetic shock.  Hilarious.  We could have all teabagged him while the ambulance was on his way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eric, you feeling better?  Starting to, yeah.  It really stunk, though, man.  That's sloshing vomit.  Oh, my God.  Did you get a whiff of that, dude?  Dude, how hard were you laughing?  Oh, that's too goddamn funny. 
[04:12:00]  How many times did he power booze?  Like 10 times?  It's got to be 10, and it was liquid.  Did that pill get used?  Yes.  No.  Shut up, Jimmy.  All right, Jared.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up, Jared?  I won a MiFi.  Yes, you did.  After all that, you won the other MiFi today.  Awesome.  So I guess we'll get some info from you, so stay on the line, okay?  I already got the info.  Oh, you do?  All right, congratulations.  Anything you want to say to Ben?  Ben, you're not a dick. 
[04:12:30]  Ben is kind of a dick because he blew off the whole contest.  He's at the computer.  He's probably answering your stupid emails.  Yeah, bring a...  Let's get Ben in here.  There's no puke in here.  He could come back into the studio.  Ben.  I made a mistake, too.  They want to talk to you.  I only sent, like, 11 emails to Steve.  All right.  What is he saying?  He's saying no.  He's not coming in.  He said he's doing stuff.  Yeah, Ben has a serious problem with...  Oh, that's right.  He wasn't in here the whole time.  No, he ran out as soon as the contest started. 
[04:13:00]  He went to screen the call.  I think he's got to be in here for these contests.  You're the boss open.  I think that you and Ed can put your feet down.  He should.  All right, Jared.  Congratulations.  You won the other MiFi from Maine.  Maine.  I appreciate it, guys.  I look forward to coming to the show, and you rock, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  There he goes.  Jared from Maine.  Are we getting rid of all these people out here?  I would say if they want to hang for the extra time, we're almost done.  Yeah.  They're probably going to want to take pictures and stuff like that, probably.  Okay.  All the gurgling, splashing sounds of vomit. 
[04:13:30]  Well, you need a rowboat going...  A motorboat.  A rowboat.  Fucking asshole, I am.  A rowboat.  Row, row.  You stink.  A rowboat.  Ah, I can't find the clip.  Shut up.  A rowboat.

I don't understand why people accept the burn of tequila. 
[04:14:30]  Even those so-called high-end tequilas.  I'm Ken Austin, founder of Tequila Avion.  Historically, you take a shot, recoil from the burn, and make that tequila face.  What's the pleasure in that?  Avion is the finest handcrafted tequila that uses only the best agave and is filtered slowly.  So slowly that the burn you expect just isn't there.  And that's why at the 2012 San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Avion won world's best tequila.  Look, I don't sit atop some giant liquor empire. 
[04:15:00]  I'm just a regular guy who always loved tequila, pursued my dream, and surrounded myself with amazing people.  And now you too can enjoy the world's best tequila.  So the next time you go to your favorite bar or liquor store, ask for tequila, Avion.  If they don't have it, ask for it louder.  So why drink anything else when you can drink what the top bartenders in the world call the world's best tequila?  Avion.  Please drink responsibly.  Imported by Avion Tequila.

[04:18:00]  So you want to do hip-hop abs?  This is what you were watching?  Yeah, this is what I was watching.  Yesterday, waiting for your flight.  Yeah.  This and ladies golf.  Boy, you must have been hungover.  No, no.  Something was going on.  I wasn't drinking.  I drank, like, at the show, but then I just went to club soda.  But you were lazy, so why wouldn't you, like, rent a movie or something?  Uh, because I kind of wanted to go back to sleep, and I couldn't find the remote.  It was all, like, stuck in the covers. 
[04:18:30]  You know how the remotes are?  They just disappear, those goddamn things.  And the worst is when you knock them on the floor.  You search the bed for a while, and then you realize, ah, I knocked it on the floor.  Yeah.  While I was bicycling at night, just pedaling.  My feet are always moving.  I don't know what that's all about.  If you dream that you're a bear in Romania, it'll hook through your nose.  A muzzle on.  Just wanting to chew the throat out of the guy that made me do this.  How embarrassed they must be.  Brr.  Big dumb feet nailed to the pedals. 
[04:19:00]  That's right, stupid.  Here's a shekel.  Have some honey, you dope.  Look, he's bicycling.  Yeah.  I assure you how happy he is.  Oh, he's just trying to get the freaking, yeah, nails out of his feet.  Nail those feet?  Nail the feet to the pedals.  All he's trying to do is get the nails off, and then it makes it look like he's pedaling a bike.  Figure it out, dopes.  The only thing, he does not want to ride the bike.  He wants to chew everyone's head off in a place.  Right, right.  So you're running away from something in your dreams. 
[04:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because I just like pedaling.  I like to analyze dreams.  Yes.  What are you running away from?  What are you running away from?  It's like.  If you're constantly doing this with your feet, you're running it in your dreams.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, I just like the feel of the sheets.  I like the feel of the sheets.  He's right.  You're running.  You're running away from something or two.  You're running away from childhood and towards alcoholism.  Is that it?  Or running from one casino to the next?  All right. 
[04:20:00]  So this is a taste of what you were watching.  Yeah.  Yesterday in the Detroit area.  Actually, Auburn Hills.  You should go local for everyone.  It's my favorite infomercial.  All right.  Chill it.  So I know you want to do that because you're a dancer.  You're a dancer.  So let's start with our feet wide.  Okay.  Good. 
[04:20:30]  Start with your feet wide.  We're going to start with our right knee.  Mm-hmm.  Here we go.  In five.  In six.  In seven.  Right knee two times.  Pull it up.  Now left two times.  The guy's name is Sean Thompson.  He's from Jersey.  Oh.  Ah.  And, um.  I wonder what you're running away from.  Yeah.  I thought his voice sounds familiar.  I'd like to hear him go, psst.  Well, you know, he's a choreographer. 
[04:21:00]  Yeah.  So you're watching this and you couldn't find the remote, huh?  No.  No, I couldn't.  Wow.  Holy.  I bet you had something that looked like the remote tenting up those sheets, didn't you?  Wait a minute.  This isn't right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  No.  What the hell?  Not with, uh, this infomercial.  Because you couldn't find the remote, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Looked everywhere.  You know, the girl that comes on is very hot.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:21:30]  All right.  Good.  Here she is.  Don't try to twist this around, my friend.  No, we'll just let the audience speak for itself.  Yeah.  Uh, very simple.  I know you got, and you're probably like, Sean T, you need to give me just a little bit  more because I know you're fly.  Here we go.  Now let's grab your wrist, okay?  Keep your feet wide.  You're fly.  Grab your wrist, and then we're just going to take it from here.  Seven.  I'm just saying, pull it up, push.  Grab those ankles, pull those knees behind those ears. 
[04:22:00]  Hip-hop abs.  You know, a lot of people are finding out-  That's the one I call the power bottom.  Yeah.  A lot of people are finding out that Anthony's now working out.  I'm thinking you might have done a little hip-hop workout in that hotel room yesterday.  Let me tell you something.  Did you put your leg warmers on and a headband and get up and do a set?  There is no way in hell you would get me to do hip-hop abs.  But you are working out.  It was the one.  Well, in a gym, like real people do, not hip-hop abs. 
[04:22:30]  I bet you was beside that bed just hip-hopping away.  Of course you was.  I was not hip-hopping.  He was trying to get some abs going.  He had like a cut-off sweatshirt like you used to wear 1980s Go-Go's videos.  I was not.  Headband.  Headband.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hmm.  Well.  Well, we got one more clip.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  These don't even sound like they're from the infomercial. 
[04:23:00]  Yeah, okay.  They don't.  Thank God.  Now look, we're about to go tempo, okay?  So don't be in your house looking mad.  You got a smile, act like you got a little attitude.  Here we go.  Are you ready?  I'm ready.  Are you sure?  Here we go.  Let's try it.  Five, six, pull it up.  Go.  Up.  Adjust.  Now swipe.  Punch high.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Be a little aggressive.  Let's still have a little flavor, okay?  Here we go.  Let's try it.  Go five.  Go six.  Toss let rain. 
[04:23:30]  Never see a nude girl again.  Toss let rain.  The first time they do it to you, you feel pain.  Toss let rain.  Look at your father's face.  It's full of shame.  Toss let rain.  And the back of your shirt now has an awful state.  Toss let rain.  Well, couldn't really find a chick in there. 
[04:24:00]  Maybe she's later in the show.  Yeah.  Why would you admit this?  Well, because I think you got that off of the actual tape.  Yeah.  I don't think that was part of the infomercial.  No.  Uh-huh.  The infomercial, you know, a lot of those.  Cool now.  That'll get you rock hard abs, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rock hard abs.  And it's fun.  It's not all the crunches. 
[04:24:30]  And, you know, at the gym, these people are talking about how much fun they had.  I picture you looking like, uh, I don't know, John Travolta and staying alive when you're  working out.  That's what I do.  I dress exactly like that.  I don't know what you're trying to do.  The headband.  You get it?  Yeah.  That's pretty much what he was watching.  Well, I think that's part of the tape and, again, not the infomercial.  The infomercial was a lot more cheesier, I guess, than the actual tape.  These dancers are in the best shape on earth, but they always dance. 
[04:25:00]  They dance for six hours a day.  Yeah.  These aren't like the people that are doing this at home, like sending away for it.  Yeah.  Some fatty from the middle of Akron or something is going to get this tape to get her fat body  in shape like these dancers.  Ain't going to happen.  My mother used to do stuff like this when I was growing up.  She would jog around the house.  My mother was a psychopath.  Jog around the house?  She would jog from room to room like a little old lady.  She would start in the living room and jog through the kitchen.  Get the hell out of here.  I swear to God.  And she would jog into the bedroom because she had to watch my sister. 
[04:25:30]  Why wouldn't she go outside?  Oh, she had to watch your sister.  Apparently she had no friends who could help her out for an hour.  And she would just jog into the rooms around the house.  And my mother would just jog in the house.  Actual jogging?  Slow.  Putter walking.  Putter.  Walk putter.  Walk putter.  It has to be slow.  How big was your house growing up?  Yeah, she wasn't sprinting.  Right.  She would jog.  It was awful.  That's hysterical.  All right.  I'm going to have a Bailey's Irish cream.  I'm going to sleep with a cigar.  I don't know what that meant.  Win it, win it, win it, boo. 
[04:26:00]  That's it for the worst of Opie Dan today.  That's it for the worst of Opie Dan today.  That's it for the worst of Opie Dan today. </pre>
