<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with speculation about Christy's absence, possibly due to a bridge-related incident.  The hosts then launched into a comedic barrage of news commentary, mocking an allegedly explosive Pope Francis interview (revealing atheism and racist jokes), a Russian woman quitting live television, Mick Jagger's interview, and Fez's emotional state.  They extensively discussed the new Cosmos series and Neil deGrasse Tyson's presentation style, contrasting humanity's insignificance with ongoing global conflicts.  One host confessed to significant stock market losses.

Several callers contributed to the show's chaotic energy. One caller passionately defended the movie "Her," sparking a heated debate with the hosts, involving accusations of bullying and delving into the caller's personal life and sexual preferences. Other callers discussed "Her," the woman who drove her car into the ocean with her children, and a dog's tattoo.  The hosts also discussed images of a Duke University student working in the porn industry and a dog tattooed under anesthesia. Throughout this section, the hosts employed extensive crude, misogynistic, homophobic, and ableist language.

Guests Rich Voss and Bob Kelly were mentioned as scheduled to appear later, along with Neil deGrasse Tyson.  A substantial segment focused on mental illness, prompted by the news story about the woman and her children in the ocean.  In-studio guests Rich Voss and Bob Kelly, along with a phone call from psychologist Lydia, discussed culpability, mental health treatment, and hospitalization. Lydia shared graphic personal anecdotes. Callers shared their struggles with mentally ill family members, highlighting challenges with care, privacy laws, and employment. The segment concluded with previews of a live podcast with Voss and Kelly, and a discussion of the "cake horn" controversy involving Sam Roberts, Ron Efez, and Kate Quorn.  Offensive language and graphic descriptions were prevalent.

A significant portion revolved around a dispute between Ron and Fez over a matchbook, escalating into a heated exchange with Fez threatening a heart attack.  The argument shifted to a Macy's gift certificate Ron had exchanged for shirts instead of using, leading to criticism from other hosts.  The discussion included tangents on tattoos, moisturizing, and listener attempts to discredit Fez.  Listener calls further fueled the controversy, questioning Fezâ€™s sincerity.

Neil deGrasse Tyson's guest appearance followed, initially focused on his Cosmos series.  The conversation broadened to include scientific topics such as spaghettification, the Bermuda Triangle, the dinosaur extinction, and the relative dangers of deep-sea and space exploration.  Tyson explained complex concepts accessibly.  The hosts repeatedly teased Rich Voss, resulting in offensive insults and name-calling.  A celebrity identification game further fueled the comedic, insulting dynamic.  The show concluded with promotion of upcoming events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everyone.  Time to do this again.  And again, and again, and again.  And again.  There we go.  Oh boy, Christy's going to speak today, I see.  My boy, Christy. 
[00:00:30]  Your boy, Christy.  I remember him being my boy.  What's he doing, man?  Why is he so silent?  I think he's disgusted with the whole thing.  I mean, the bridge thing, they've tried and tried to tie it to him.  Yeah.  And they haven't been able to.  But they just keep, like, keep on it.  You know?  So I guess he's, like, leave me alone kind of a thing.  I'm not addressing it anymore, he says.  So he should just, you know, start making his public appearances again. 
[00:01:00]  I know he's made a few here and there.  Yeah, yeah.  He used to be front and center, talking almost every day.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he was.  But I guess he's talking about something.  CPAC.  I don't know.  What's the CPAC?  He gives a shit.  All right.  I know what a CPAC is.  What's the explosive interview with Pope Francis?  Do we have that story yet?  Yeah.  He admitted he's an atheist.  Oh, all right.  That'd be really shocking.  Oh, okay.  Groundbreaking. 
[00:01:30]  He's a fan of this radio show.  Oh, all right.  Thank you to Pope Francis.  Cat porn.  Yeah.  He just likes really racist jokes.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that too.  That's what it is.  His favorite movie is Breaking 2, Electric Boogaloo.  It really blew the doors off the place when he said that.  Oh, Pope hints at greater role for women.  Oh, yeah?  Phil, you're not allowed to let the women have anything in the church.  Quite the progressive Pope, this guy.  I like this guy.  Yeah, he's a good Pope.  He is.  He's, you know.  For whatever the Pope is. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, you know.  What are you going to do?  I think it was a tactical move.  They saw that Pope Benedict had zero good imaging.  He just looked creepy and all pomp and circumstance.  Oh, he really was a ghoul.  That was the worst.  He looked great in ruby red shoes, though.  Oh, my God.  Oh, see, with those red shoes.  Ruby red shoes.  That was so creepy.  Queen.  Yeah, queen.  Who would do that?  I don't know.  It was pretty bad, though.  And why is this Russian broad quitting on live TV?  What's going on?  There's weird stuff today.  Is it over the Ukrainian shit? 
[00:02:30]  And why is that dude interviewing Mick Jagger?  Oh, my God.  A lot of questions we've got to answer today.  What kinds of things going on when you don't have sound?  I know.  On the TV.  You just see the pictures.  You're like, what could that possibly be?  Who knows?  What are they chit-chatting about?  Why is Fez crying?  I mean, a lot of questions to be answered today.  I bet I know one reason.  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts?  I'm sure Sam Roberts, instigator extraordinaire.  Right.  Was involved in some way, shape, or form.  Sam, it's very obvious to everyone. 
[00:03:00]  If you quit, hopefully now, Fez will be better immediately.  Is that what?  It's very obvious.  Are they talking shit about me down the hall?  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very obvious.  If you just quit, everything will be better with Fez.  Oh.  That's what happens with those people.  Maybe I need to do the right thing.  Maybe it's been me the whole time.  Probably is.  I would bank on that.  How would you feel if you quit, and the next day, stock was $7 a share?  Oh.  How is the stock?  Is it good?  Yeah.  All right.  Much of these guys can drive you nuts. 
[00:03:30]  It was a nickel at one point, and now it's three.  It was up to four-something at one point.  It's creeping up.  It's going good.  I probably should have bought some shares when it was five cents.  Not a nickel.  That would have been nice.  Yeah, you know what?  Then it would have went down to two cents.  It's just the...  I hate that shit.  Yeah.  I gave up after Citadel.  I know.  Oh, that was really a crushing moment.  Now I have some basic investments.  Right.  Screw that all-in shit. 
[00:04:00]  Leave it to the professionals.  It's nice to know you can laugh at losing $115,000 like it's nothing.  Terrible.  It's not nothing, obviously.  It's a lot of fucking money.  Holy crap.  It's down to $355,000.  $355,000?  Just because you talked about it, right?  Yeah.  I bought one share at 15 cents.  I got my one share portfolio.  I go in there.  I'm just watching it grow.  Nice.  We got a lot of people coming in today.  We got Rich Voss. 
[00:04:30]  Is Bobby coming in, too?  And Bob Kelly?  We also have Neil deGrasse Tyson coming in today.  His new show, Cosmos.  I saw the first episode.  Very good.  He's great, right?  Yeah, man.  They put a lot of money into this show, production-wise.  Yeah.  And Neil just knows how to talk.  And he also knows how to walk out of frame dramatically.  Oh, does he do that little walk out of frame thing?  I might have to make fun of him.  He did it three or four times in the first episode.  Makes that incredible point and then dramatically walks out of frame. 
[00:05:00]  And then all you see is, like, the Cosmos in the background.  That's good.  What I like, though, is he started from the beginning, which is nice, you know?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, like what?  Big Bang?  Before he gets into some crazy stuff.  Yeah, you know, where we are in the universe and stuff.  Yeah.  It just reminds us how ridiculously insignificant and tiny we are.  Yeah.  Oh, it's horrible.  Yeah, we're pretty tiny there. 
[00:05:30]  We're just...  Insignificant.  We're barely a piece of dust in the world.  Yeah.  If the universe was the world, I don't even think you could put it down to scale where  we're just a piece of dust.  Yeah.  Earth is a piece of dust.  And, I mean, yeah, Earth is a piece of dust, but the actual Earth is the universe.  You know what I'm trying to say?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's not even that.  Yeah.  It's not even that.  You'd need more room.  Way more room.  Way more room.  And then we just sit here and beat the shit out of each other. 
[00:06:00]  Then you turn on...  I watch Cosmos, and then I turned on the news with the Ukraine and Russia and everything  else going on.  I'm like, what are we doing?  What are we doing to each other?  We're just like bacteria.  It's pathetic.  It's like watching the news.  If cancer had news, and then you're saying the two cells were fighting over...  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Same thing.  Yeah.  But what are we doing?  It's so obvious that we really should try to figure out how to get along.  We make awesome phones.  Now, that's pretty much it. 
[00:06:30]  So dumb.  He made a great point.  It stuck with me.  When he was in, he said about life forms, like, the next closest thing to us is apes.  And the average three-year-old or two-year-old is as smart as the smartest ape.  Right.  Imagine if the next life form was just that much, was one click above us.  Right.  Like, their two- and three-year-olds were as smart as the smartest of us, how advanced  they are.  Yeah.  I'm thinking about, like, how smart that was of him to say, and like, fuck, man, there  really could be a lot brighter things out there. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That wouldn't even acknowledge us.  Our brains just suck.  Yeah.  Because none of us could understand the concept of infinity.  No, it's very hard.  But it's a real concept.  But our dumb brains can't really figure that out.  No, we need an ending.  Because then we're like, okay, it has to end.  And then you think, well, what's on the other side of the ending?  There's no infinite space.  We can't even understand that concept yet as humans.  But Brian Greene was great because he said, like, we didn't need to know that. 
[00:07:30]  Like, you know, it's like when you're worried about a saber-toothed tiger attacking you,  it doesn't matter what a black hole is doing.  Yeah, who cares?  You just kind of need to know what you need to know to survive.  He was throwing numbers around like it was nothing, Neil, on this new show Cosmos.  Big numbers?  He either said millions or billions, and it's like, yeah, whatever.  Same thing.  He was talking about how there's millions or billions, I forgot at this point,  of planets that are just in pitch darkness.  Yeah.  That we didn't even see for many, many, many, you know, years. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And we can now see with the infrared.  Just millions or billions of these planets.  Sitting there frozen.  Sitting there frozen.  Pitch black.  In complete and utter darkness.  Just go there with a flashlight.  Yeah.  That's why school was a waste of time.  We didn't learn this when we were growing up.  We learned there were, what, three planets, I think, maybe?  Three.  I remember nine.  Yeah.  Was it always nine?  I remember nine with Pluto.  But they were convinced that's all there was out there.  But now apparently Pluto isn't a planet. 
[00:08:30]  No.  Yeah.  If it's round, it's in the sky like that, it's a planet.  I mean, stop.  Yeah.  What's the difference, really?  Pluto's a cuckold moon.  It really is.  Uranus, Neptune.  It doesn't know what it is, right?  Sitting there in the corner.  Is it a moon?  Is it a planet?  And shouldn't the moon just be a planet?  Screw it.  It's like a planetoid.  Yeah.  What?  Something.  Planetoid.  Why?  I don't know.  It doesn't fit the criteria for a planet anymore.  Our criteria.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All that is up there, so just call it all planets. 
[00:09:00]  It's not big enough.  Its orbit is a little fucking wacky.  But, uh, really good show.  Very easy to follow, which is nice, because that astronomy could fucking blow your mind  after a while.  Yeah, they've gotten really good with the graphics and stuff, and kind of making it easy to explain  that way, instead of some guy just rambling on.  Right.  See, I like just to see numbers on the screen.  That's how you teach kids.  You like that?  Just with numbers.  Numbers scrolling on a screen.  Yes, decimal points where they need to be. 
[00:09:30]  Some guy yelling at you to understand it.  Somebody was telling me about the guy who memorized Pi to, like, a thousand digits or something.  Like, you know, Pi, they say 3.14 goes on for however long, and I forget how long.  These guys look autistic, and he's one of those guys that just, I guess his mind just latched  on to that fucking Pi rate.  It goes on forever, right?  Yeah, I don't care.  I think it just keeps going and going and going and going, and they have contests to see  who could go the furthest with remembering it or something.  Well, I'd like to be in the audience for that one. 
[00:10:00]  That's exciting, right?  I have been a record of 67,890 digits.  Memorized.  That was a Chinese guy in 2005.  67,000?  Yes.  All right.  So let's try it now, man.  3.14.  I'm out.  I'm going to go with 2 next.  That's 1, 1.  3.14.  I just like the 1, 4.  2.  It's fine by me.  7?  You're already wrong.  5.  What is it? 
[00:10:30]  3.141.  I said 1.  1.  9.  You were right.  You're smart.  9?  Yeah.  There's a 9 in there eventually.  Remember if there were no 9s?  Wow.  67,000.  67,000.  That guy just rattled them off.  74.  The one guy who we talked about, who I don't know who he is, he said he memorizes that stuff  like, he pictures it in a weird way, like as musical stuff, or he sees it as like planes.  I see it as dead hookers. 
[00:11:00]  I'm counting their toes.  But it's some weird way, like Daryl Hammond sees his impressions in colors.  Yeah.  These weird colors.  Green, blue, red.  He practiced for four years.  He practiced that?  And then his attempt, which was successful, lasted 24 hours, four minutes, and was recorded  on 26 videotapes.  Did he record it?  Yeah, but it was also witnessed by eight officials from Guinness.  Oh, they were there, okay.  That's a guy that just doesn't get laid. 
[00:11:30]  No, no.  There's no time for any of that vagina.  Did he go to the bathroom?  That pesky vagina.  Did he go to the bathroom?  I don't know.  It doesn't say.  Is there a pause?  Can you pause for a minute?  I bet you could.  I don't know.  No, because maybe you could cheat in the bathroom.  Well, no, they probably, like with chess championships, they would make sure that there was no computers  in your, they'd probably do the same thing.  Like, they'd make sure your bathroom's got nothing.  Yeah, but it probably would wreck his rhythm, so he probably would just pee in his pants.  He's just pissing, trying to remember his place.  What?  I'm at the five, five, five, five.  Right, right, right. 
[00:12:00]  No, there's no way he took a break.  You get that brain going, and you've got to keep that, you know, that rhythm going.  24 hours.  Unless he memorized it in patterns, like where the break comes at, say, three hours.  Right.  And then maybe he starts, and five, and two, and one, he sings it to himself.  Find out if he peed his pants.  Yeah, please, we'd love to know that.  I think you could keep your poop at bay.  24 hours?  I think you can.  You could hold this shit in for 24 hours.  You can.  Unless you've got the old leg-wobbling need to.  When everything just starts shivering. 
[00:12:30]  All you can think about.  Everything starts shivering.  Yeah, is going to the bathroom.  That's all that your mind is occupied with.  Yeah.  Wow.  It really does just completely cancel out everything else of importance in your life.  Absolutely.  My friend Jim said the best.  He said it's that telltale heaviness in your lower back.  And that was the best description I've ever heard of it.  It is.  A heaviness.  I love thinking about really famous people shitting. 
[00:13:00]  They just have.  It makes me happy.  Just sitting on the ball.  Like, within the next hour or so, Obama is going to be taking a big shit somewhere.  What do you mean you think?  On the American people.  Over the Constitution.  You're welcome for the setup.  That's not where I was going with that, but.  Well.  Yeah, like the Queen Moon.  Yeah, yeah.  Somewhere is about to take her dump.  Yeah.  They all do it. 
[00:13:30]  Just makes me happy to think that.  All those glamorous women on the red carpet for the Oscars.  It's just sitting there fucking cutting one off.  You know they're squeezing out just little spaghetti dumps, though.  Yeah.  They barely eat.  They can barely squeeze anything out of them.  Little salad dumps.  Rabbit pellets.  Right.  And you know a few of those starlets before the red carpet were absolutely in a bathtub  with an enema with their legs up in the air.  You think they were cleaning out?  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Getting rid of poo weight so they look good on the red carpet.  Jesus.  I would bet a lot of money.  Yeah.  Some very famous actresses especially were doing that.  I bet the skinny skinny ones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If that ones don't care.  Let's say hi to John on Long Island.  First call of the day.  My God, John.  What do you got?  My God?  I wanted to defend the movie Her.  Why?  Yesterday.  Why do you need to defend that?  Well, everything that you were asking, Stan, yesterday, it does get addressed in the movie. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  But we were just trying to go for some jokes.  Yeah.  Oh, you were just trying to go for some jokes?  Well, I was going to say that the movie is actually really fucking good.  And if you guys actually gave it a chance, that actually...  White night for the movie.  Yeah.  That actually you guys would like it.  Especially just...  Do you understand how a radio show works at all?  I just need to ask that.  I don't understand how a radio show works at all.  Yeah.  That's not right.  We just decided that maybe this would be a silly concept. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  That we can make some jokes.  I mean...  I'll probably end up seeing the movie someday and maybe I'll even like it.  I don't know.  No, I figured that.  That's why I just wanted to bring your attention to it.  I thought that Sam just didn't give it justice.  Well, Sam's an idiot.  Sam didn't need to give it justice.  The Academy gave it justice.  Everyone knows that it's considered...  That's a lot, though.  Everyone knows it's considered a good movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But to Ant's point, I am an idiot. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  What was the biggest problem you had with our bit yesterday?  I didn't have a problem with it.  I just wanted you guys to actually give it a chance.  You're calling it a fag just because you didn't even pay attention to it.  Wow.  This guy's reprimanding us.  He's right.  Do you talk to your...  I'm not reprimanding you, no.  Hey, hey.  Raise your voice.  Hey.  Easy.  Easy.  Easy there.  You're bullying, sir.  I'm not bullying.  Stop your bullying.  Why?  Now you're denying it.  Why was her a good movie? 
[00:16:00]  Go ahead.  It was amazing.  It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and pick up little things.  It takes place in the future, but it doesn't tell you exactly when.  Hey, Ships.  I got to tell you, nothing worse than seeing a movie over and over again.  As a parent of an almost four-year-old, trust me, there's nothing fun about seeing movies  over and over again.  You don't discover new things every time?  Oh, God, no.  You have to see it over and over again.  You can see it over and over again.  How many times have you seen it, sir? 
[00:16:30]  How many times have you seen it?  This is Joaquin, by the way.  Yeah.  I've seen it.  I've seen it three times.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  So that's just over and over again.  You saw it once, and you saw it over, and then over again.  It's too new to watch that many times.  This movie talks to this guy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it talks to me, exactly.  No, I'm being serious.  Why would you go see the movie three times?  Well, no, I mean, you can relate to the movie a lot because it's like relationships and  stuff.  But the thing is, the whole concept is that he doesn't try to, you know, he gets the OS,  the operating system in the beginning, not as a relationship, but he ends up falling in love 
[00:17:00]  with it because it ends up being better than his relationships that he tries to go for.  Don't tell me the ending, sir.  You've convinced me.  Yeah, I'm on it.  Don't spoil it.  Okay, well, you're going to talk me down the whole time, but I really think...  Oh, wow.  Now he's paranoid.  Oh, no.  Do you want me to send you copies?  I'll send you copies.  I certainly do, sir, but no address will be given.  No copies had been sent. 
[00:17:30]  I'll figure it out.  It was time to send it to you.  Yeah, the knife is plunged into me.  Here's your copy of her, and she sticks it to me in my chest.  Makes love to my corpse.  Hold on a minute.  Ray in Baltimore once in.  He doesn't have to call him Ray.  Yo, Ray, you're on with John.  I'm going to fight with somebody.  I'd like to say John never gets laid.  Well, that's fucking a retarded ass.  I get laid all the time.  Oh, how could you not?  It's his name.  I'm a retarded ass.  I'm from Baltimore, motherfucker.  I'll kill your ass. 
[00:18:00]  I'm from Baltimore.  I'm talking about a fucking movie.  He's from Baltimore.  That's right.  You know Baltimore, Ant.  Yeah, there's some violence going on in Baltimore.  Yeah, well...  That's right.  That's right.  Thanks, guys.  Punch it out.  All right.  I don't know.  Well, the guy...  Oh, yeah, it totally got smashed.  It's right there.  This kid knows how to handle himself.  John's hostile, I think, though.  Yeah, why are you...  Hostile.  Why are you so hostile?  Maybe this radio show isn't for you, because we were just going for a dumb bit.  I don't even know if it worked. 
[00:18:30]  We just were fooling around a little bit.  You guys have been hostile this whole week, so I was trying to fucking chill you guys out  with a nice awesome movie.  I don't think we've been hostile all this week, have we?  Chill us out.  We have a movie.  We have?  You've had some hostility this week.  Yesterday was very hostile.  Name all the hostilities we've had.  A few hostilities.  I mean...  Yesterday was very hostile.  What?  The Jason Ellis thing?  That got hostile.  What else?  Well, I'm happy about that Jason Ellis thing, because you know what?  I gave him a chance.  I tried to listen to him.  And, you know, I liked him when he was on your show, but then, like, I couldn't really listen 
[00:19:00]  to him.  I have a long-distance friend that, like, likes him, but fucking...  Sir, hold on.  It's not that we're not interested in your biopic.  It was just that the old person was asking Sam a question, and he was just answering it.  Yeah, I just want to know all the hostilities we've had this week.  Definitely.  I'm not asking you.  No, he's got it.  Oh, boy.  This show, by the way, is definitely for him.  Yeah.  Yeah, 100%.  What were some of the other hostilities, John? 
[00:19:30]  I'll ask you.  Wait, now you're asking me?  Now I'm asking you, yes.  So many of the hostilities.  Todd show?  Oh, the Todd show.  I forgot about that.  But did we do that this week?  I think in the beginning of the week.  Not really.  There was some...  That was last week's hostility.  Ron and Fez hostility happened.  There's no Ron and Fez hostility.  Cakehorn is hilarious, and Fez should get over it.  Okay, come on.  Get over it.  Well, yeah.  I mean, Fez really should get over that shit, but he's not going to. 
[00:20:00]  He's one of those guys that needs attention.  I think he's gay.  Wow, one of those guys, huh?  You think he's gay?  I don't know, sir.  We don't want to get sued.  Right, please.  It has nothing to do with him being gay.  Who cares if he's gay?  My God.  Is he gay?  I don't know.  We're doing a show in 2004, apparently.  I think he's gay.  I didn't say that I think he's gay.  I think he's gay for attention.  Oh, okay.  He's not even gay.  Can you think gay for attention?  Wait, you don't even think he's gay?  I'm gay.  He's never fucked anybody.  It doesn't matter.  You know, it doesn't matter.  He's never fucked a girl.  He's never fucked a guy.  What does it matter? 
[00:20:30]  Well, sir, it doesn't.  Of course, meaning you can be, you're gay or straight is not defined by whether or not  you're having sex.  I understand that.  If you did, you wouldn't have said that.  No, he doesn't.  Listen, listen.  What a combative caller he is.  You're a combative caller.  I don't like him.  He's just all over the place.  He is all over the place, and he's combative with everything we say.  Yes.  I'm not trying to be combative.  You look, see.  You took the most basic bit we did yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  Dare I say it was just a silly throwaway, and you're obsessed with the fact that we  were beating up your movie.  Well, I was, yeah, because I liked the movie, and I was just, it was a phone call that I'm  watching it three times.  A whole phone call that ended up turning into a whole phone call that ended up this long  thing.  Now, now we're talking about that.  Oh, God.  When do you sit there with the channel guide on and decide, I'm going to watch it again.  Right.  Everything else that's on that I haven't seen, fuck that.  I'm going to watch it again, and then do it again. 
[00:21:30]  I'll tell you what, when that text goes out that says, what are you doing tonight?  Yeah.  Right.  And nothing comes back.  Nothing comes back.  Yes.  Then it's like, all right, I'll watch her again.  The thing was, I didn't want to watch it at first.  I had a friend over, I was fucked up, and now we get the history of the movie with you.  I was wondering.  He's setting the scene for us.  Yes, please, sir.  Sitting there with your friend, his cock firmly planted in your mouth.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes.  Yeah, exactly.  Taking selfies like you're puffing a big cigar. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, look, I'm like a Dick Tracy villain.  Whatever.  So I watched it the first time, and then I realized it was an awesome movie.  It was better than American Hustle.  American Hustle is a fucking retarded movie because, oh, gee, the con artists in the end  were the con artists.  Wow.  Yippity-doo-dah.  No, it was a good con artist movie, though, sir.  Yeah, but how many do we have in those?  Christian Bell is actually different.  It's written so much better than fucking...  Yeah.  Christian Bell is an amazing actor. 
[00:22:30]  Why are they closing the curtains?  Closing the curtains?  There's some kind of surprise happening.  I don't know.  No?  Why are we closing the curtains?  I don't know.  Why are we closing the curtains?  He's answering, I don't know.  The call is answering, I don't know.  Why are we closing the curtains?  Sam will tell me.  Sam?  Voss is already here.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, okay.  And he's already staring at us through the glass.  Jesus.  There's a reason why we do... 
[00:23:00]  Right, sir?  What's going on?  Tell Voss.  Let's say he gets booked on Jimmy Fallon.  He can't just stand there, you know, peeking around a curtain if he gets there early.  You have to find a more believable scenario than that.  I know.  What is he doing?  Is he right out there already?  Night.  Sir?  Is he?  Just exasperation.  Anything else, John?  Sure.  I don't know. 
[00:23:30]  It's funny.  I don't know.  People are loving you.  Let me go to Scott in Virginia.  Scott?  All right.  Hey, asswipe.  Why don't you shut the hell up?  What, are you going to have a fucking pre-show like Sam?  This guy off the pre-show like Sam, what the fuck are you talking about?  All right, John, I apologize.  I picked up the wrong line.  It was this guy who's loving you.  Colin in Jersey.  Colin, go ahead.  This is the guy that sits in the bathroom and jerks off to Siri. 
[00:24:00]  Like, yeah.  Get the fuck off the phone.  Like the movie.  Yeah, there's something going on with you.  I didn't want to see the movie at first.  I saw it.  Whatever.  But somehow the movie talked to you.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Yeah, it talked to you.  No, what's going on with you that you liked the movie so much you had to see it three times?  Well, it's the same reason why you like 90 Day Fiance.  It's like the same thing.  No, I'm not watching the same episode three times.  I'm watching a series.  That's true.  Well, that's the difference between a series and a movie, you know? 
[00:24:30]  What?  Because the movie's...  Something else is just, you know, whatever it is.  But because the movie's not a series, you've got to watch the movie like it is a series  and keep watching it over and over again?  That's what's in me on the time that I watched it three times.  Hoping it changes.  One, I watched it the first time, I watched it fucked up.  The next time, because there's just little things in the movie that it is written very well.  What was one thing you picked up on the second time you saw the movie?  Oh, the fact that the trend in the future that people just... 
[00:25:00]  Some people wear their pants a little bit higher up and there's a lot of things that  they don't tell you and you just pick up on.  With their pants higher up.  Well, that's a must-see three times.  That's the reason to watch the movie a second time.  Yeah.  To pick up on that.  They tell you a lot of stuff and you just pick it up and you just go with it.  Like what?  Well, the fact is that not everybody's okay with the whole concept of having an OS that  talks to you and you become friends with.  And people, it's just trying to break through the fact of the... 
[00:25:30]  It's the beginning of actually people enjoying that.  Obviously, the guy's wife is totally against it, so that becomes an issue and things like  that.  This guy loves it.  What?  What?  Yeah, well, I do love the movie, but...  Oh, see?  He's combative again.  So I'm going to answer the questions and then you're going to tell me that I love it.  Well, I answer the questions.  Wow.  Is this guy fucking angry?  He's right.  John, what do you do for a living? 
[00:26:00]  What do I do for a living?  I rather not say because you just make fun of me.  Oh, come on.  We all had shitty jobs.  What line of work?  Well, I just...  Right now, I'm just delivering food.  All right.  Well, how old are you?  28.  All right.  You're right at the cusp.  Yeah, right at the cusp.  All right.  I'm not going to make fun of you.  You know, you got to do what you got to do.  What?  Pizza?  Nah, I used to live with pizza.  Now I'm just delivering food for a diner.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah.  I've actually hung out with Anthony. 
[00:26:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, she hung out.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  That's frightening.  On his phone.  Where'd you hang out with Anthony?  Uh, at the...  Oh, shit.  The fucking bar we were singing at.  I can't remember.  Something with nine in it.  Oh, bar nine.  Bar nine.  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, bar nine.  There you go.  The bar.  Something with nine in it.  Something with nine.  Bar nine.  But did you actually hang out with Anthony, or you just felt like that was going on?  Anthony and I, I guess...  Well, no.  We were fucking there.  He was with his girlfriend, and we were talking for a while. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And then some other guy came up and was talking to you.  I pulled him away.  I don't remember.  Whatever.  It was a while ago.  I don't remember anything.  And then there was a time when you were here on Long Island, and whatever.  I was telling you, whatever.  I forget about it.  I don't know why I like this guy.  He is pretty funny.  Something about you.  There is something about me, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you guys, tired today?  Actually, no.  Let me say hi to Mike in Florida. 
[00:27:30]  Mikey.  Hey, this guy has enough time to watch this stupid movie three times, but he's so short  of time, he has to keep saying OS instead of operating system.  What the fuck kind of logic is that?  This guy retarded.  I said both.  I said OS and operating system.  What are you saying?  Oh, you keep saying OS.  I'm angry so bad.  You're like in the club.  If you say OS, that means you're cool, and you know what you're talking about.  You're like a shit bag.  What?  What are you, retarded?  In one sentence, it just said OS, and when I said operating system, you couldn't figure 
[00:28:00]  out that they're both the same fucking thing?  No, stupid.  I've heard you say it three fucking times.  What's the matter with you?  You're fucking retarded.  You're trying to make fun of me.  You could have done a better job, dude.  There's a lot of you.  All right.  Let me say hi to John in Canada.  John.  Hey, morning, guys.  Morning.  This guy sounds like a serial killer.  He should probably get out of his mom's basement and go out and see the world.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Shit out of my mom's basement.  Good.  All right.  Good.  What the fuck?  Serial killer.  All right.  How do I sound like a serial killer? 
[00:28:30]  I don't know.  I'll shit my book.  You're watching robot movies three times in a row.  I didn't watch it in a row, you retard.  I watched it three times.  It's been out for a while.  I've been having it for probably over a month now.  So three times in a month.  You haven't watched the movie three times.  In a month?  No.  That's crazy.  No.  It's almost once a week.  Yeah, that's a little nuts, I think.  Yeah.  Wow, that's crazy.  It's like seeing it every ten days. 
[00:29:00]  That's a little weird.  Yes.  I believe it's a little weird.  Well, the movie was new.  It was written very well.  I've never seen a movie written that well, so I wanted to watch it again.  The first time I watched it, it was fucked up, so I wanted to watch it sober.  And then I watched it again.  Yeah, we remember that part.  This must be how it feels here in the same conversation three times.  Now we understand.  One more call.  Hollis.  You guys kept on asking me.  Hollis and Reno.  Hello.  Hey.  Dude.  Now, okay, I haven't seen this crappy-ass movie, this douchebag you're talking about, 
[00:29:30]  but the bigger thing, why are you hanging out with this guy, Anthony?  I mean, did you fuck him in the mouth?  I mean, come on, tell us the truth.  I don't think so.  I was probably at bar nine, like you said, doing a gig or something, singing some with a band,  and he was there.  This is the ugly side of being a celebrity.  Yeah.  We get scary people.  You guys know the fuck how it's there.  Now we're in trouble.  Please don't say that.  We get in trouble when that happens. 
[00:30:00]  There was a lot of shit that happened.  When Jim Jeffery stopped drinking, and then all of a sudden he started drinking again?  Yeah.  Well, I was the asshole that made him start drinking again.  Where was that?  Oh, it was at a fucking, after it was one of his shows or whatever, we were all hanging  out and stuff, and I was like fucking wasted, and I kept on telling him to take shots and  shit, and he finally did.  Right.  And then a couple times we hung out, and we went fucking all to a couple bars.  Actually, my cousin started fucking like all the groupies that he had, the chicks that 
[00:30:30]  were trying to bang him and shit.  So your cousin banging the girls that wanted to bang Jim Jefferies?  Wow, this guy gets around.  Let me say hi to Rick in the Bronx.  Rick.  Hey, oh, listen, tell this fucking douchebag, John, hurry up with my fucking delivery of  my eggs and bacon and sausage and shit.  Get off the fucking phone and do your fucking job.  You're fucking.  I'm not fucking working now, you retard.  Hey, fuck you.  You're not even fucking working.  You're sitting there talking about bullshit. 
[00:31:00]  It's seven and a fucking movie.  You're doing a fucking lame-ass movie three fucking times.  The movie sucks dick like you do.  You didn't even see the fucking movie.  You fucking piece of shit.  Get off the fucking phone and bring me my fucking food, you faggot.  Whoa, whoa, whoa with the F word.  Whoa.  The F word.  Wow.  John, relax with the retard word, man.  That's not cool.  I don't know.  It just comes off my tongue.  All right.  Are you done? 
[00:31:30]  Everything's good with you?  Everything good?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  When are you going to see her again?  I'll watch it right now.  No, I'm being serious.  I feel like you might watch it a couple more times.  Oh, he'll watch it.  No, actually, well, I got another friend that I want to show it to, so I'm going to fucking  watch it.  Oh, my God.  He's showing his friend.  He's probably sitting there.  Look, look.  Watch this part.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  This, this, this.  Look, look, look.  The guy's like looking at his phone.  He's like, no, no, no.  Don't.  Look, look.  Let me rewind.  You missed it.  In all my years, I don't think I showed a friend a movie. 
[00:32:00]  Let me show you a movie.  I got to show you a movie.  Will you come over?  Whatever.  I'll come over Anthony's house then.  Oh, wow.  I'm sure you will.  I'm sure you can look at it.  He actually delivered pizza right in his area, too.  Of course.  That's good.  That would be funny if he ever ordered, but the pizza sucked where I was delivering at.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it's been a pleasure.  Yep.  Call back any time there, John.  Oh, yeah?  Can I go to Opie and Anthony's party?  I mean, Anthony's party next time? 
[00:32:30]  Next Anthony's party?  Uh, no.  I figured that would be the answer.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Punch it out?  You can't punch out after that.  Found a new character today, I think.  Oh, yeah.  He's angry.  I don't know what's going on with him.  Insasperated, angry.  He's passionate.  I love when we find a new character.  He's a hoot.  He's a hoot, all right.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  All righty. 
[00:33:00]  Eat some food.  Talk about Cuba.  Eating some food.  That's right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Page of our paper is pretty fucked up today.  See the guy that tattooed his dog?  What do you do that for?  Oh.  I don't know.  Wait.  Is your front page different?  This one.  Oh, there you go.  Then I got this.  There you got the Duke student that does porn.  That's hot.  That's how she's getting by, paying her tuition. 
[00:33:30]  Why is she telling everybody, though?  I don't know.  I don't like it.  Maybe somebody found out.  Oh.  Sometimes that happens, and they just do it to get ahead of it.  Cute.  An 18-year-old Duke University student, suddenly the most popular freshman on campus,  is looking for a little more financial aid under the sheets.  With a dozen skin flicks under her belt, she was back in Los Angeles on Wednesday preparing  for another porn casting call.  The budding porn star featured in films like Lick My Lips and How Do You Like It hopes 
[00:34:00]  to screw her way all the way to graduation.  All right.  Are they still making money doing the actual porns?  I don't know how she's paying a 40-something thousand dollar tuition doing porn.  They don't make that much for scenes.  I don't understand it.  Unless she's doing a bunch of scenes per film, maybe they do.  I really enjoy sex, and I've always loved watching porn, so it just seemed like I could  pay my way through college doing something I really love doing.  Knox, a woman's studies and sociology major.  What a good girl. 
[00:34:30]  Like Jimmy said, tuition is 47 Gs.  The petite brunette said her family was supposed to pay for school.  When that didn't work out, she considered taking out loans, but she didn't want to strap  her family with debt.  She says she wasn't eligible for government loans and typical student jobs, just didn't pay  enough.  It was November, and holiday break was approaching.  Then it hit her.  Uh-oh.  I literally just Googled how to be a porn star.  Oh, shit.  It came up with all these modeling agencies.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God. 
[00:35:00]  And I literally just sent in my pictures and my height and weight, she recalled.  I was getting calls literally within days with people saying they really wanted me.  She is cute.  She hopped a plane to L.A. a month later and immediately started her career as Lauren.  Within two days of meeting people here, I was shooting.  The first porn I did was absolutely nerve-wracking because it was really weird to have a photographer  watching me have sex.  I was super self-conscious, but then I just got into it.  Anal?  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure that out. 
[00:35:30]  Belle Knox, her poor name, wouldn't say how much she makes per film, but she has no problems  paying her bills.  In addition to financial freedom, she found comfort within the industry.  There you go.  Nice.  Yep.  She's lovely, too.  Sexy.  Asked what her family thinks of her new career.  Knox declined to answer.  That means they're not happy whatsoever.  They're guilt-ridden over not paying her tuition.  How about some nude pictures, Sam?  What are you, a mo?  Stop finding out where the fuck are her graduation cap on.  Right?  What the fuck?  I'm leaving my family out of this, but they are aware of what I do, she said. 
[00:36:00]  They still want her to be a lawyer, she conceded, and she has no plan to let them down.  I want to be a woman's rights or civil rights lawyer.  Maybe start a foundation for sex workers, she's saying.  Let's see.  That's her?  You don't start a foundation for sex workers two weeks after you're in the business.  Yeah.  God, I love her.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  She looks very smooth.  Yeah, she's really cool.  She's really cool.  Can we find another one?  Sam, you just got one big one.  Sam, come on.  Don't you know how to look at porn? 
[00:36:30]  Stop jotting things down.  You got one big one blown up.  What's that, our picture for the day?  Get us another one.  Yeah, let's go.  Show me her hiney.  You got to, like, let's see her.  Exactly.  Let's see.  What is that?  A vagina.  Go to the one where she's showing everyone where the poo comes out.  She's a nice vagina.  This is where the poo comes out.  Oh, man.  I'd pay her tuition.  Yeah?  Yeah, if she would just kind of hang out with me, not once, but I mean a bunch, I'd pay her tuition.  47?  Yeah.  Let's get her on the phone.  I've got pictures. 
[00:37:00]  She'd have to cough up a lot.  Yeah, she'd have to.  And often.  Yeah.  All right, let's get her on the phone.  Let's see what we can figure out here for little Jimmy Norton.  Just make home movies with me that I show no one.  Where's another one?  That I masturbate fervently to.  What's wrong with you, Sam?  Sam does not know how to look at girly pictures.  Yeah.  Well, a male friend spilled her secret to members of the Duke fraternity he was pledging.  What an asshole.  What a loser.  Spilled the beans.  A male friend.  Yeah, that means like, you know, she wasn't interested in this guy. 
[00:37:30]  Or he banged her once and then bragged.  She's doing porn, dude.  Yeah.  I would tell my friends.  You wouldn't?  At that age, I would.  Yeah, now I wouldn't care.  You know what?  I think you're probably right.  If I was like 20.  18, 19, 20.  You think her family likes that picture?  No.  No.  I hope so.  She's sitting on a penis with her legs propped up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm filling up.  She's actually great.  So let's start getting her on the phone.  Let's say hi to Dan in New York.  Dan.  Dan.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  So I'm a former Duke student. 
[00:38:00]  I definitely, this piqued my interest, so I kind of looked up some of the back story  of this girl.  So it turns out some, she was doing porn to get into school.  Some frat guy, I guess, was watching the porn and had recognized her on campus.  Oh, that's hot.  And, yeah, yeah.  So he then kind of blew up her spot and just started telling all his friends.  She wanted it, you know, obviously on the down low.  And once he started telling everybody, she did a kind of like an exclusive with the 
[00:38:30]  campus newspaper, kind of hiding her identity and her porn name.  But then, of course, you know, Gawker and all the other websites kind of picked up on  it and started looking into her.  And they all blew up her spot.  She wanted to stay anonymous.  And then they all just kind of picked up on it and created this whole thing.  But this works out for her now because she'll make more money for her scenes.  Oh, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  Because now she's got some celebrity to her.  Yeah.  She's got Jim Norton taking a look.  Yeah.  She wanted to stay anonymous. 
[00:39:00]  And then everyone just didn't respect that.  All these women's groups started coming out, saying it was degrading and this and that.  And now she's in this.  You know, she just came out.  And that's good for her.  What do you expect kids to do these days?  Yeah, they've got to pay their bills.  47 Gs for collars.  That's ridiculous.  Right.  Should not be that high.  All right.  All right.  So I'm going to punch out like a real.  Yeah, you're right.  All right.  And I'm sure that's just for the year.  47 Gs a year.  Is that her sucking that penis? 
[00:39:30]  Yep.  Yep.  That is.  Well, she's just holding it and licking it.  Like no one licks a penis that way.  No.  Like you just hold it and lick the head and then stop.  Do it or don't.  Yeah.  Stop futzing around with it.  Shit or get off the pot.  Stop futzing around.  Futsing.  Don't futz with the penis.  Quit futzing with that thing.  Or just licking the underside of the head.  What are you doing?  Quit with the crown tickle.  And you want to go to a better story? 
[00:40:00]  Oh, better than that?  Oh, yeah.  Good luck.  Same thing, but it's a high school student.  Oh.  Middle school.  A woman drives straight into ocean in Daytona Beach with kids in car and possible murder  suicide bid.  Hey, to all you assholes out there, just leave the fucking kids alone.  Go kill yourself.  Oh, they like taking the kids with them.  How about you just leave the kids on the fucking beach and then you drive into the stupid ocean? 
[00:40:30]  Because they're thinking, well, the kid's not going to be able to live without me.  Oh, really?  You got to take them with you to spare them.  Just me, me, me shit.  That's all it is.  Me, me, me, me.  Leave the kids on the beach.  They'll have fun playing in the sand.  She just drove into the ocean.  Yeah.  And a bunch of people were there.  She's pregnant, too.  A pregnant woman drove her SUV into the ocean with three young children inside near Daytona  Beach in an apparent murder-suicide attack.  After talking about demons.  They love demons. 
[00:41:00]  Before you kill your kids, you got to say that you talk to Satan or something.  Right.  Ebony Wilkerson, 31, drove her Honda Odyssey van wildly along the shoreline near Silver Beach  Avenue before veering straight into roughly four feet of water, almost submerging the  vehicle as onlookers watched in horror.  That's attention-seeking.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's attention-seeking.  You don't think you're committing murder-suicide by driving in front of everyone at the four feet  of water.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I sat in the tub and held my breath.  Lifeguards rushed to pull the Daytona woman and the three children, ages 10, 9, and 3, 
[00:41:30]  from the water as the minivan began to take on water.  One of the frantic children wailed.  The mother had snapped, according to reporters.  He was screaming, the mother snapped?  What?  Yeah.  How old was he?  Well, he got a 10 and a 9 and a 3.  Oh, so the 10-year-old was probably like, ah, mom snapped.  Is she a white lady?  This is a white lady crime.  You know her name is Ebony or something?  Ebony.  I would say it's a white lady crime, yes.  Yeah, it's a white lady.  Yeah, it fits the white person. 
[00:42:00]  The two in the backseat was crying with their arms out, saying, our mommy's trying to kill  us.  I can't read this shit.  Our mommy's trying to kill us?  Jesus.  Please help.  You know?  Oh.  That's all right.  They'll get over that, right?  I don't know, Ant.  That's a big one.  They'll get over that.  I don't know.  Talking about demons prior to leaving the residence with her three children.  They're young children.  Okay.  The sister said they knew something was up because she was talking about demons and 
[00:42:30]  they got all the kids in the car and took off.  Just another psycho.  Like, when we can eventually isolate mental illness and just squash these people out in  the womb.  Yeah.  Yes.  Just another nut.  Just suck them out.  Oh, of course.  Oh, they got to go to the Susan Smith thing.  They got to show Susan Smith.  Right.  They got to get to Andrea Yates, two mothers who kill.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So, kids are doing all right.  Was there a hashtag from, what's her name last night? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Nancy Grace.  What's that bitch's Nancy Grace?  No hashtag.  Isn't she wonderful?  Ocean Mom.  Probably.  Tot Drown.  She'll probably go with Ocean Mom.  Ocean Mom.  No, it's not good enough, actually.  Ocean.  No.  You like death.  Drown Mom.  Drown.  Drown.  Kill Kid Mom.  I hate her hashtags.  I hate her.  Staying with her sister who lives in this area.  And her sister says she'd been saying some scary things. 
[00:43:30]  That she was trying to get her into a shelter.  But was having trouble doing so.  And then when she took off with her kids in the minivan, that's when she called 911.  She's talking about Jesus and that there's demons in my house.  She got the kids in a call with him.  She's black.  She's black.  Shortly after that call, officers stopped the minivan.  That's her sister talking.  But they couldn't do anything.  If the officers had known that or had made any statement that she was suicidal or that  she was homicidal, that she was a danger in any way, Daytona officers would have taken 
[00:44:00]  her into custody.  They say she didn't.  Minutes later, bystanders on the beach became heroes, including this man who rescued two of  the kids by himself.  I reached in, grabbed the son first, and grabbed the daughter, and then that's what I did.  She went in the water?  That guy out.  Crazy.  Other rescuers tried desperately to get the little girl out.  In less than two minutes, all were pulled to safety.  The waves were strong.  The water was cold.  They got in the water, got them out of there.  She was angry that day, my friends.  If it had been minutes longer, the outcome probably would have been... 
[00:44:30]  They should have just left the woman in there.  This morning, the children are at the FBI.  Everyone would have been headed off.  They should have just left her in there.  Now, reporting live in Daytona Beach, Ricky Cloud...  I mean, they didn't know what happened to her.  Who knows?  But you just leave her in there.  Good.  Get what you want.  Yep.  Give the kids to somebody more qualified to...  I don't know what happened.  Who knows?  I mean, it's pretty obvious.  Who knows?  I mean, like, until you get her out of there...  You just don't make a sharp left turn when you're driving on a beach. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, we know she could have had a stroke.  Who knows?  Why people drive into the ocean when she got lost.  She got lost.  That goddamn GPS system.  Right.  Turn left.  You want Nancy Grace's hashtag?  Yes.  What was it?  Ocean Mom.  It was Ocean Mom?  It said Ocean Mom.  It said Ocean Mom.  Ocean Mom.  What a pig she is.  Ugh.  What a hateable pig.  Pig fucker.  Ocean Mom.  Yeah.  Ocean Mom.  That's just horrible.  Nancy Grace tries to make her Twitter more, uh, followable. 
[00:45:30]  Provocative.  Provocative, right.  What a pig that woman is.  She's using all these things.  By using dead kids.  Fake outrage, and then she uses all these things to try to get some, uh...  Right.  Followers.  Oh, I hate her.  She is terrible.  With her stuffy nose.  Yee.  So what's up with the tattoo on the dog?  I don't know.  Are people outraged?  Oh, boy, are they.  Why?  They cut dogs' balls off.  I'm sure this is fine. 
[00:46:00]  He was asleep.  Um, was he asleep?  It's on the front page.  A Brooklyn tattoo artist, huh?  Yeah.  Bragged about inking his dog with a heart and his wife's name while the poor pup was drugged  after surgery.  Aw.  And animal lovers are barking mad.  Oh, get it?  Oh, God.  The papers.  Tattoo master says, uh, my dog is cooler than yours in an Instagram post Wednesday that  revealed a photo of what appeared to be his zonked-out pooch sporting the romantic tattoo.  Mmm. 
[00:46:30]  You think that hurts the dog?  It probably doesn't feel very good.  I don't know how conducive dog skin is to tattoos either.  Right, right.  I would assume, uh, it's not exactly the same as, as humans.  She had her spleen removed yesterday, and the vet let me, the vet let this guy tattoo  her while she was under.  Oh, she was under.  All right.  Oh, I don't know.  It's your, I think you're putting the, the dog at unnecessary risk there, maybe for infection  or something like that, so.  Hey, look, every time they do it to a Doberman Pinscher's ears, they do that for effect. 
[00:47:00]  Whenever they make a Doberman's ears point straight up, that's to look cool.  That's not natural for the dog.  Yeah.  So people do shit all the time for aesthetic reasons.  People should shut their faces.  Well, the ASPCA said this, the tattooing of an animal for the selfish joy and entertainment  of its owner, without any regard for the well-being of the animal, is not something the ASPCA  supports.  Oh.  So there you go.  Well, that's a fucking, what a fuddy-duddy kind of a comment that is. 
[00:47:30]  That's just stupid.  I don't, I really don't care.  No, the dog was out.  I wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't, you know.  You wouldn't do it to Beavis?  No, I wouldn't do it to Lil' Beavis.  A little tattoo.  Oh, he'd probably try to swat at me.  It's adorable.  Yeah.  Good for him.  I don't know, though.  But does that fuck up dogs, like, skin up?  Probably not.  I know they put little tattoos sometimes on dogs to, like, identify them and shit like that. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, well, that's a quick, easy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like that.  That was pretty involved.  It's like some red in there.  Right.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Michael in Pennsylvania.  Michael.  Hello, Mike.  Yeah, hey, quick question.  Unless I heard wrong about that crazy chick that drove into the water.  Jim had said, let her stay in the car, you know, get it over with.  I thought, Opie, you said that she was pregnant, though.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  I didn't think of that either.  I was going to defend Jimmy before I even heard Jimmy's answer. 
[00:48:30]  I don't think he knew that she was pregnant.  I did, but I actually just forgot.  Yeah, so.  It ain't a kid until it comes out, anyway.  Yeah, that's a good point.  I thought maybe I heard wrong.  I was like, wait a minute.  Now they're talking about killing the little innocent kid.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  I didn't think of that, so I guess it's good they pulled her out.  All right.  All right.  No problem.  No problem.  I just wanted to clarify and see if I heard right.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dr.  What?  What happened?  For the first time in a long time, Lydia.  Oh, wow. 
[00:49:00]  Hi, guys.  Wow.  Hi, Lydia.  Oh, you sound chipper.  What's that?  Lydia, for the newer listeners, is our clinical psychologist.  Yes.  She's a...  Where have you been?  Right here.  Oh, I've been listening.  I've been listening.  I just...  Well, I was going to give you...  I wanted to give the resume, though.  Oh, here you go.  You've got big fake tits.  You drink a lot, and you were touched as a child.  Well, that is part of my resume, I guess, yes. 
[00:49:30]  She jacked some guy off in the woods, and he came on her.  Oh, that's right.  Right, right.  That was...  Oh, my God.  I remember that story.  Yes.  I don't remember that part.  Right, but that's what happens.  Exactly.  You went home with pine cones in your hair, and what looked like taffy in your ears.  Taffy.  You thought, like, a tree had, like, leaped sap all over your face.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I thought when you said my resume, you were going to talk about my degrees.  No.  God.  That's so silly. 
[00:50:00]  That's a waste of time.  We all know that.  Yeah, whatever.  You been good, Lydia?  I've been good.  I've been good, yes.  Staying out of trouble, mainly.  I'm not calling you guys.  But some days I can't resist.  You know, I understand that people with mental illness can be very trying and very demanding  and extremely narcissistic.  Exactly.  But a lot of this has to do with how difficult it has become to hospitalize people.  As you guys talked about when you were reading the article, her sister called the police, 
[00:50:30]  and rightly so, because here's someone, in a very bad way, talking about demons, which  sounds very much like auditory hallucinations, yet she, until she actually drove that van  into the ocean, she hadn't done anything that allowed her to be hospitalized psychiatry.  Right.  Yeah, but she, you know what?  I understand she's nuts.  She's a nut.  But she also knew what she was doing, and she could have just left the kids there.  She's just being selfish.  Also, you know, we never hear the stories about the people that had families intervene 
[00:51:00]  and did get help, and nothing happened, and that's why you don't hear about it.  So you're never going to be 100%, so some of these people are going to slip through,  as they say, and you get these situations.  That's certainly true.  Of course it is.  You know, there is a lot to be said for family intervention, but...  Say it all, please.  It really has become very, very difficult to get help for people with mental illness. 
[00:51:30]  You know, there's a whole big thing about how people get treated for mental illness only  when they finally go to jail, in many instances.  Right.  More importantly, how are those giant fake tits of yours?  They are fantastic.  Nice.  Thank you so much for asking.  Nice.  Do you like nipple play?  Yes, I just have them checked out.  Well, I do like nipple play, yes, and one of the nice things that happened when I got  my implants was I was still able to have sensation in my nipples. 
[00:52:00]  I was concerned about that.  Sensational.  Are they big or are they small nipples?  I think they're sort of normal size.  They're not really big, but I don't think they're really small either.  They didn't change.  I like that perfect bowl of porridge.  Yes.  Not too hot, not too cold.  They're just right.  I like phallic nipples that look like railroad spikes.  The accent is horrendous.  It's a friend dresser with big tits.  I don't mind the accent.  Those titties don't have a big accent. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, boy.  Well, I am Brooklyn born and bred, raised in Coney Island.  And once saw a dead body.  I just remember that about you.  All right.  That is true.  Stand by me.  That was her.  She was the girl with the big tits.  What was the...  My husband won't let me call you again for another five years.  Why?  Oh, he was the one that prevented you from doing our show?  Well, no one ever prevents people.  But he did point out that it might not be good to talk about dead bodies in my apartment on the air. 
[00:53:00]  That's probably right.  But that was like in the 70s or something, right?  Oh, yeah.  Way back when.  Yeah.  And what?  You woke up and there was just a dead guy on your couch?  I'm trying to remember the story.  You were holding a knife?  Something like that.  Something like that.  I never hurt anybody.  But, you know, someone did pass away in my apartment when I was young.  But the problem here is that you guys disposed of the body in that dumpster.  Oh, I don't know anything about that.  But my ex did carry him out. 
[00:53:30]  And I do believe that he may have indeed done that.  I'm just kidding.  Right?  That's good.  That's great.  But you had nothing.  Lydia had nothing to do with that.  Absolutely murderous.  Nothing to do with it.  Absolutely nothing to do with it.  Only a little to do with it.  Thank you so much.  All right.  Not much to do with it.  Well, Lydia.  I appreciate your reiterating that.  Just a bit to do with it.  No.  No.  I'm just calling to say give people with mental illness a little bit more wiggle room. 
[00:54:00]  Jimmy does such a great job on the Advice Show, which I haven't been able to hear in a very long time.  Nobody with ears has.  Oh, boy.  You had to bring that up.  No, no.  You had to bring that up.  I was promised it's returning.  But, yeah, I know what you say, Lydia.  I get very annoyed at them.  But I don't get annoyed at people who really think that monsters are chasing them.  Because I think they're genuinely fucking crazy.  Monsters.  But the selfishness of the mentally ill is not addressed enough. 
[00:54:30]  And you can't get them in hospitals anymore, so not as easily.  And what the other caller did, I mean, I'm sorry, I think Anthony said, and he actually  was very insightful when it comes to this kind of stuff, that mentally ill people, you  know, who are very depressed really believe this.  They leave their children behind.  They're leaving them in a very bad place, and they're better off taking them with them.  They're doing them a favor by killing them, right? 
[00:55:00]  I think it's also selfishness.  They don't want the kids to go on without them.  That's it.  They want to just take the whole ship down with them.  That's a selfish angle there, too.  I was telling these guys, Lydia, to your point, a story that gets to me still.  I think about it every once in a while.  Around Christmas, you had a guy, very close to where me and Jimmy live, by the way.  He's having a problem with his ex-wife, so he decides, I'll take care of the problem  with my ex-wife.  Like, by taking my kid, who's in his Christmas pajamas, and we're going to go as high as  we can in the building. 
[00:55:30]  I'm not sure if it was on the roof, but I think it was pretty close.  And he jumped with his kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just a horrific story that happened here in New York City around Christmas time.  That is a horrific thing.  It's like you couldn't leave the kid behind, really.  Unbelievable.  Mental illness drives people to do horrific, horrific things.  I'm not saying that they're totally blameless.  And we all have to coddle them.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  What's wrong today? 
[00:56:00]  But the same thing with...  What is wrong with today?  What's that?  You know, the same thing with the school shootings.  This is an issue with treatment of mental illness rather than gun control.  The school shootings are not happening because of issues with gun control.  Right, yes.  They're happening because of lack of treatment for people with mental illness.  But again, that's also because, you know, well, you can't invade somebody.  People are so protective about their records.  You should be able to see somebody's mental health records if you're going to hire them. 
[00:56:30]  Is this person a nut?  Well, but what about the people who have recovered from mental illness and then get barred from jobs?  Well, then there has to be a way to judge that somehow, too.  Right.  Like, there has to be a way to balance that.  But just because some good people might not get jobs, you can't put everybody at risk because, you know,  the privacy laws don't allow some psychotic to get a job.  It's irritating.  I personally think it would be better if we all lobbied for more care for the mentally ill 
[00:57:00]  and more treatment and more options and more open-door policies rather than taking away civil liberties.  But, you know.  I don't want to take away civil liberties, Lydia.  I don't want to take away civil liberties.  More coddling is what you're for.  Yes.  I see it differently.  More of your psycho babble.  Right.  I say line them up and push them over a cliff.  There you go.  The Spartan way.  On televises.  On pay-per-view.  You have some hard personal experience. 
[00:57:30]  Do I?  I think you do, yeah.  Bye.  Is that what you're trying to say today?  No, not really.  Okay.  Now I'm going to do this to you.  Someone wants to say hi to you.  Okay.  Hello?  Hi, Lydia.  Do you remember me?  It's Irving.  I don't remember your name.  All right.  Irving.  Irving claims that he touched Lydia as a child. 
[00:58:00]  Irving did.  Oh, you did say his name was Irving.  Yeah.  I did.  Okay.  Yes.  Jeff.  Lydia, it was consensual, and I know you remember that.  Remember you were in your bikini?  Irving, what you did was a horrible thing to me and many other people.  Oh, gee.  And there's a forum on Facebook for growing up in Seagate where people are talking about you.  Wow.  I'm famous.  Thank you for doing that. 
[00:58:30]  Really?  There were other people in Seagate that Irving fucked around with?  Absolutely.  But, but Lydia, you were my favorite.  Oh, that's sweet.  What a delight.  That's a good thing.  It's like my birthday listening to your nasal twang again.  Just jacking off on the kids.  Oh, my God.  What a monster.  Fucking Seagate.  All right, Irving.  He was a really disgusting monster, yeah.  Whatever happened to the real Irving there, Lydia? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, well, I hope he's dead, but I know he got a serious beating at one time.  Why do you hope he's dead?  He's mentally ill.  You should focus on the treatment.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  You should get him the health that he needs, Lydia.  I draw the line at pedophiles.  What line?  I don't believe pedophiles are mentally ill.  What do you mean we've got to get in line?  Lydia is letting personal experience dip into her professional world. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, that's right.  That's exactly right, Anthony.  That's one of the things that's very difficult for me to be understanding.  All right, Melfi.  Enough of you.  Why do you think, Anthony, that everyone gets bored when I talk?  Oh, why do people wish that my segment wasn't coming up and there was more whacking?  Yeah, why, Anthony, do they hate looking at my dumb legs and my boring voice and my face that looks like we weren't shot in the same room ever?  All right, Lydia. 
[01:00:00]  It was great catching up with you.  Yes, Lydia.  All right.  Thank you so much, guys.  Have a great day.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Let me say hi to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, first off, I want to say I love your show, and I've loved it for a long time.  Good.  But there's one thing I want to comment about your discussion about mental illness.  We want to be very careful about painting mental illness with a broad brush.  Oh, I love that. 
[01:00:30]  Because some of Jimmy's sensual deviations could be considered as mental illness.  I understand that, but I think we all, as intelligent people, we kind of go under the assumption that we know the difference between a guy banging a hooker and a woman driving her children into the ocean.  Yes, and I agree.  And I think you know that I'm not discussing all forms of mental illness, and I'm not talking about people that are OCD, and I'm not talking about people that hoard. 
[01:01:00]  I'm talking about people who are a direct danger to injure other people.  Mm-hmm.  And absolutely.  And anyway, thanks a lot, guys.  I love your show.  Oh, you're so bad.  And have a good day.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to John in Virginia.  John.  Hey, guys.  I want to talk about the opposite end of this spectrum here, about having to be careful about things like this.  In 2005, my cousin, who was my next-door neighbor, is one of those people who always carried his Bible under his right arm, and he got mad at me one night because I didn't want to listen to his preaching, and I kicked him out of my house. 
[01:01:30]  Well, because he was mad, he decided to call the police and say that I was this drunk asshole, which I was drunk, and I was being an asshole.  And he was afraid I was going to hurt someone and maybe hurt myself.  Well, the police came, and since I was drunk, they said that they had to do something.  So they took me to the hospital because they were afraid I was going to hurt myself. 
[01:02:00]  Well, I went to the hospital, and they said, well, you're obviously not any harm to yourself who can come pick you up.  Well, like Ant, I'm a gun enthusiast, and for eight years, I had no problem buying firearms or anything like that, and I went to get my concealed carry permit, which is a little bit more in-depth, and where it says, have you ever had any in-house psychiatric treatment?  Of course.  I put no because I haven't.  Well, I get called down to the police department, and they say, you know, well, what happened here in 2005? 
[01:02:30]  And I said, what do you mean what happened in 2005?  Uh-oh.  And they said, you know, what happened with this temporary detention order?  I said, what temporary detention order?  So, yeah, you do have to be a little bit careful when it comes to this psychiatric treatment and things.  It took me a year and $12,000 of my dollars to get that dropped against me, and I still now have for the rest of my life a psychiatric treatment file on my case. 
[01:03:00]  I haul hazardous materials.  I get a Homeland Security background check.  There's not one thing wrong with me, but just because one asshole got mad at me one night because I didn't want to listen to his preaching, I now have a psychiatric background on my record for the rest of my life.  And I can kind of understand this.  Every time I go to get a background check, I don't have to put that on there, but as soon as they put the paperwork through there on hold, sometimes for a day, sometimes for two days, and I have to come up with some sort of elaborate excuse as to why it's put on hold. 
[01:03:30]  Because, you know, you can't exactly put, oh, well, I was in the psychiatric center, and, you know, now I've got to have everything put on God damn hold.  You know, that kind of makes you look like an asshole.  John, I got to tell you.  I got to tell you something.  I think John was pitching a fit right there, huh? 
[01:04:00]  Get over it.  Just get over it.  Relax, buddy.  Whining and crying and pitching a fit.  Pitching a fit.  Let's say hi to Doug in Syracuse.  Doug.  Hey, guys.  I'm calling in because I've been taking care of my mentally ill brother for 10 years.  He's a violent, narcissistic fuck.  He's a violent, selfish, narcissistic fuck.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  He's exactly what Jimmy was talking about.  Let me guess.  No sense of appreciation.  No sense that maybe he's the problem ever.  That his issues caused these problems around him.  None of that, right?  Nothing.  He's ruined my life, my family's life, my extended family's life.  He's held back everybody and everything around him for literally the entirety of my and everyone 
[01:05:00]  in my family's life.  Then let me ask you a question.  Why do you deal with this zero?  Like, the thing is, totally separate yourself from this person.  It becomes this weird relationship where people feel this need.  Well, I don't want to.  Yeah, but.  Fuck them.  It's the family thing.  So what?  Family is family, but fuck them.  You're stuck with some of these people.  We had a discussion, I think it was about three years ago, me and the whole, basically,  rest of the family, where we basically had a discussion. 
[01:05:30]  It was either, we take care of him or he dies.  Like, that was it.  We had, and we all basically had to discuss, like, how would we feel if we killed him?  Like, that was it.  And we're like, we would be upset.  Okay.  Like, if we were directly responsible for his death.  But you wouldn't be, just by, by just, sorry to interrupt you, by freeing yourself of him.  I know you tied him with family by, by, but you don't have to see him at all.  If you choose not to see this fucking leech, I don't care if he's sick, he's ruining your 
[01:06:00]  life.  And he's, like Obie said, he's unappreciative, not aware.  It's not that easy, though, unfortunately, because you do have that biological connection.  He's a genuinely insane person.  He's mentally ill.  I finally.  He's biologically mentally ill.  I finally got to a good place with my own mother, but it took a really long time, man.  It's not easy.  And unfortunately, I wish it was easy.  God, I would have saved a lot of heartache in years.  So, what, what is he doing now, Doug? 
[01:06:30]  Now I manage, finally, I got him on enough medicine that he's been fucking tranquilized  enough that I was able to get him a job to get him out of the country.  Doing what?  That I would need to move him out.  I convinced him that it was his own idea to move the fuck out of the country and take  a job in fucking China.  Doing what?  And tranquilize in China.  I swear to God.  That this was his own idea to go. 
[01:07:00]  I think he's a lead tester in China.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  It's one of those jilts programs where weirdos go and teach English in China, where you don't  need any qualifications, apparently.  You gave China your problem.  That's amazing.  That's a good one.  Yeah, I respect that.  Yeah, I love.  And what was great about it is I convinced him it was his idea, where this was going to  be this huge opportunity, and he was going to go and be this big shot, and it's a big  adventure and shit.  And he has weird jilts friends who are like, don't do this. 
[01:07:30]  This isn't going to be a good idea.  And he's like, ask for you guys.  I'm going to be a huge fucking success.  Yeah, and now he's there, and he's calling me, because apparently you can get a cell phone  for nothing in China.  He's like, China's weird and scary.  A lot of tea, also.  It's right here.  Fuck you, dude.  You're in China now.  Do you pick up the phone when he calls?  No.  Good.  Oh, my God.  Is he doing all right there?  I read his Facebook posts. 
[01:08:00]  He's doing pretty good, because believe it or not, most of the people he's working with  are even crazier than him.  Right.  All right, so maybe it's going to work.  So can we send our mental patients to China?  That'd be great.  Why don't we just do that?  Right.  From what he's told me, I did pick up the phone once.  He's been there about a month now.  From what he's told me, if I can believe everything he said, because he is a narcissistic, selfish,  lying fuck, the people he's working with are these off-the-grid weirdos, because the job 
[01:08:30]  just pays you in cash.  They don't give you a check.  There's no, like, taxes.  They don't do anything.  They just pay you in cash.  You go, and you're the tutor for Chinese millionaire children, who they bring their kids in.  They teach them English, but they already know English, so they just want to know how  to talk more American-like.  So you just talk at them, and then they talk back at you, and you just have to be very  polite, and that's the job.  So they pay you in cash.  See, I told you guys years ago, the Chinese are a common. 
[01:09:00]  Well, if we could send our nuts over there, and a few Chinese over here, that's a good  deal.  All right, man.  Well, thanks for your story there, Doug.  Thank you.  All right.  I want to take Jay's call in Philly.  Jay.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  I listen to you guys a lot, and the only reason I'm picking up the phone is because it's subject  matter.  And I've got a sibling.  I'm from a large family.  My parents are actually quite old, 87 and 81, and the only reason I've got to deal with 
[01:09:30]  a sibling who's got a mental illness problem is because she has free reign to come over  to my parents' house whenever she wants.  And I'll tell you, she's ruined so many events.  Oh, God.  Imagine that.  I know you can stay away from somebody, but when you've got parents that don't want  to disown their child and think they can make a difference even when they get involved 
[01:10:00]  in these programs to support these people, like she's made my last month of living hell  to the point where, I mean, I'm not 54, I'm not some young kid, but I'm trying to do the  right thing for my parents.  She's lost her kids.  She lives in the state of New Jersey.  They take her.  You know, she certifies that you don't have to work, and she's learned how to play the  fucking system in the state to do not a damn thing.  I got my best friend who calls me up last week.  She showed up at the gym, and he goes over, not knowing my sister's a whack job, he goes 
[01:10:30]  over to say hello to her because back when I got married 30 years ago, he recalled who  my siblings were.  The next thing, she's telling them, I'm over getting my parents drunk at the house and  poisoning them, trying to get into their money.  I'll take some bullshit.  I called the cops on her, on her boyfriend, which is one of like all these guys she finds  on the internet just to go the fuck out with.  I don't have a resolution for it because I'm like the trustee from my parents' will to 
[01:11:00]  take care of their health, and now I've got a bunch of siblings questioning who I am because  I've got a whack job.  She's got in their head.  And what did she do to your parents that you're worried about?  Well, it's not what she does to them.  I mean, like last week, I'm in there because my mother's calling me up.  My father's missing a checkbook from the trust and a register, and I've got to put a stop 
[01:11:30]  payment on everything, but she's just got her ass starting a bunch of fucking rumors.  But I used to feel sorry for her.  I'm at the point now where it's like I wish something would happen to her.  Yeah, you get exhausted after a while.  You get worn out, worn down.  He sounds worn out, worn down, doesn't he?  Absolutely, man.  And then my sister.  But the majority of the people that listen to this radio show, they have one like this.  It's very close to them. 
[01:12:00]  And that take up all the attention, or most of the attention of the whole family.  Well, I know there's a lot of people out there that have problems and got to be on something,  but I've got to tell you, when you've got to deal with something and it's not by choice,  it's a living hell, and you wish they would remove themselves, or one night they would  decide they can't take it anymore.  There you go.  But you don't want to be getting the phone calls where you're being blamed for all their  bullshit, because that's exactly what they do. 
[01:12:30]  Let me ask you, why won't your parents just cut this burden off?  Well, they're old.  Because my father is one of these people that has faith, and he believes you want to know  something.  You don't give up on your kids.  You don't leave them at the doorstep, no matter how fucked up they are.  And I respect where he's coming from, but he should have always done something outside  the house, not allowed it to come to the house.  This guy sounds, uh...  Yeah, I've just beaten by this fucking drain. 
[01:13:00]  Poor bastard.  This drain.  Thanks for sharing, Jay.  Yeah, no problem.  Have a good one.  All right.  I'm telling you, we get one of the life this guy's got.  We'll stop it here, but look.  Every single phone has somebody very close to them doing the exact same shit.  Look, every line.  So...  What a bitch.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Terrible.  Imagine that.  Yeah, like...  Every time you have an event and a family gathering or something, there's that. 
[01:13:30]  That fucking black cloud.  Just waiting for fucking...  To just ruin the good time.  But you know what the key is?  Don't invite them to the event.  Why didn't I get invited?  Because you're a fucking drain on everyone.  Yeah.  What do you mean, imagined?  Just shut them out, though.  Oh, jeez.  Like, everyone has to go, enough.  And then that person will either be alone, like they should be, or go, wow, maybe I really  am a burden on everyone.  They probably won't say that.  Well, you know what, though? 
[01:14:00]  The problem is no one ever puts them in a position where they're completely isolated and alone.  Yeah, most of them will never realize.  Well, then let them be alone.  That they're me, me, mees.  Yeah.  Then they're too crazy to realize they haven't been invited.  If they're sane enough to realize they're being excluded, they should be sane enough to  realize that they're selfish fuckers.  Yep.  But they won't.  Wait, this guy says Jimmy's really pissing them off.  I'm ready to move on, but...  Really?  Tom in Jersey.  Tom.  Yeah, man.  I'm mentally ill. 
[01:14:30]  I'm a little bit pissed off at Jimmy.  You know, look at it this way.  When you were drinking and you had your problems with alcohol, did you act like an asshole?  No, it was a delight.  Yeah, I did.  I did.  Okay.  So, as a mentally ill person, let me tell you, a lot of the times when you're acting out,  it's just like being drunk, man.  I don't remember.  You ever have those blackouts where people tell you what you did and all that shit? 
[01:15:00]  Well, it's exactly the same.  They'll tell, you know, I go into a manic state.  I've been hospitalized, everything like that.  You know, I've got a family and I take my medication.  I work hard.  And I go into these manic states sometimes through no fault of my own.  My mother was exactly like Opie's mom, you know, probably worse.  You know, I grew up looking at it.  And I can tell you, I'm not imitating her behavior because I don't remember a lot of those episodes. 
[01:15:30]  Hold on, let me, I know what you're saying, dude.  And I'm not, it's a hard thing to talk about because then it's like, yeah, this guy's saying something that's legit.  And it's not going to attack all mentally ill people.  But when I was drinking or anyone's drinking, people around have to react accordingly, too.  I'm not saying that mentally ill people should just be hit with a brick.  But when it comes to your, I mean, the person is ruining every family event.  It is the family's responsibility to distance themselves from this person.  I think, well, hold on. 
[01:16:00]  I want to speak for you there, Tom.  I think for a lot of people, we're just looking for any type of awareness.  Yes, or recognition of it.  That your illness is affecting a lot of stuff around you.  But for some reason, there's never that awareness.  And it's so frustrating for people that have to deal with a mentally ill parent or sibling or friend of the family, whatever.  There's never an awareness.  Yes, if once my mom just sat down and said, oh, my God, I'm mentally ill.  I know that.  And I know some of the things I've said and done over the years has had a horrible effect on you kids or, you know, your dad or whatever. 
[01:16:30]  That would have been one of the greatest things to happen to me.  I got you.  My mom's the same way.  She's never recognized the fact that when she was up for two weeks straight, beating us in the middle of the night, that that went on.  And she doesn't even remember that that went on.  But I never got beat, by the way.  Mine was more just yelling and screaming and just, like.  Well, that was most of it. 
[01:17:00]  Nice beating.  But listen, I'm telling you, I've been into the same places she's been, and you don't, it's not about not recognizing it.  It would be nice when you come out of it, like when you sober up if you're drunk, Jimmy, that you say, oh, shit, I fucked up.  You know, and I do.  I try to do that because I got, you know, kids and everything.  And you got to recognize it, but you got to think about some of these people that never, it's like never sobering up. 
[01:17:30]  Imagine you're 12 shots in and you never sober up.  And you're acting like that all the fucking time.  That's the same thing.  You know, I guess it's a person's fault for drinking.  But if you have 12 shots in your brain without ever putting it in there, it's not your fault that it's in there.  And you're acting like a fucking asshole and a narcissistic fuck.  But you don't have any control over it.  I understand.  Look, yes.  But I don't believe all cases are like that.  Like, what you're saying is you're saying, look, I go into manic episodes and I have these things. 
[01:18:00]  Like, you're aware of what's going on.  So that doesn't annoy me as much as, like, what Ope said.  It's people who just refuse because they're so selfish.  And they're not all 12 shots on the brain constantly.  Some of them are just selfish.  Some people are just selfish.  Yeah, there's different levels.  I'll grant you that.  Some, definitely.  But I've been in these mental institutions.  I've seen these people.  And you're right.  They're narcissistic.  They're assholes.  You know, and that's part of their illness. 
[01:18:30]  And no, they're not all 12 shots.  Maybe they're eight shots.  You know, it's this varying level.  They're sick people.  I can be a sick person.  But what really pissed me off was the first comment you made, Jimmy, about this woman who did this thing in Florida.  Yes.  You know, you said something.  And you were genuine.  It was before the jokes were really popping.  And I listen to the show a lot.  I do understand.  What did I say?  Yeah, what did you say that bothered you?  You said that we should find these people in the womb.  Yes.  And stuff them out or crush them out. 
[01:19:00]  Absolutely.  Okay, so we should find every drunk who tried to talk and kill somebody.  Yes.  Yes, you're not.  Let me finish.  Let me finish before you get on a self-righteous tear.  I'm not talking about a...  I'm not talking about a...  What did he say?  Fuck you.  Fuck you, too.  Fuck you, too.  Hey, man.  You know, I'm just calling to...  And I'm responding to you.  And I'm responding to you.  I'm telling you what I meant.  Okay, go ahead.  I'm not saying...  That's right.  I'm sorry, too. 
[01:19:30]  I don't like...  I'm not saying yank them all out of the womb by their legs.  I'm talking about when we can isolate the gene that causes mental illness and alcoholism  and all that, and they will isolate it eventually, that gene should be wiped out.  It's almost like if you can stop polio in advance, they will eventually be able to do  that, and then mental illness won't be an issue.  Of course they should do that.  Okay, that's not how it sounded or came across when you said it about this woman who isn't  in all likelihood, a sick fucking person, she's mumbling about demons, that woman is 
[01:20:00]  12 shots in and someone put it in her.  You know, you feel sorry for that woman, you've got to put her away.  I've been put away.  I don't disagree with that.  But a little bit more compassion, man.  Tom, do you have an awareness that you would leave your kids behind when you're having a  mental issue, breakdown, whatever you want to call it, episode?  You know, would my wife leave me alone for a month with my kids? 
[01:20:30]  Probably not because, you know, yeah, you can kind of see it coming sometimes, and I take  my medication and I work on it, but I've had issues, yeah.  So there are some things that I'm limited to.  I have to be watched a little more, and I have to be extra vigilant myself.  But not everybody, not everybody is as lucky as I am, has a good family, and, you know,  an understanding of this, and have gotten treatment.  It is hard to get into hospitals.  I've had mental breakdowns where I've been sitting for weeks just trying to get into a 
[01:21:00]  hospital, and I've got money.  Have you ever said just, sorry?  Absolutely.  Okay.  All right.  I swear that goes a long way.  For someone that had to deal with this growing up, that shit goes a long way, man.  And, Tom, this wacko who drove this van, she's not so crazy that she didn't know,  I have to stop at a red light, or I have, like, it's like, when you're talking about  crazy people that just go on these, she knew enough to do that. 
[01:21:30]  She knew how to get to the ocean and make the turn, like, there was enough of a conscious  and cognitive behavioral ability.  And that's what I'm trying, that's what I'm trying to get at, man.  Because I don't know about you, but when I was drunk, when I was a younger kid,  I could black out on my feet, and I could still get behind the wheel of a car.  But I'm telling you, I don't remember it.  There are a lot of that.  You don't remember what you did.  So...  It's a talent.  Mm, I like that.  I like Jimmy's point, though. 
[01:22:00]  Like, she said she heard demons, but the demons weren't telling her to, you know,  run red lights and go 90 miles an hour in a 30.  Yeah, or just run by herself into a police station and yell,  I got a gun, and get herself shot.  She knew better than to do that.  No, she was going to make everybody else suffer and take the...  There was a motive behind it.  Yep.  That I know what you mean about blackouts,  but I think that when it's this, when someone drives in to the lake light with the ocean,  there's a consciousness to it, too, man.  I think so.  Hey, Tom, thanks for the call, though, man. 
[01:22:30]  All right.  Yeah, I love you guys.  All right.  Bye, Tom.  Yeah, thank God you love us.  Yes.  Thank God.  Now I'm just sad.  What a kook.  Just relegated to kook.  Just reminds me that my mommy's broken.  Oh, no.  I don't like when we do these topics.  Oh, boy.  Brings back too many memories.  Oh, is it sad?  Bad memories?  No.  Young, little...  Little Greg.  Little sweetie, little lobster.  Oh.  That's all good.  We got Rich Voss next. 
[01:23:00]  Fair.  We got Bob Kelly next.  We got Neil deGrasse Tyson coming in in about an hour, I think, 920-ish.  He's smart.  And I want to do this.  We'll do it after the break.  Please.  More Ron Efez audio.  Oh, please.  I was reading Twitter, and I'm like, uh-oh.  Somebody goes, uh-oh, meltdown.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, he's talking about Sam.  I'm like, oh, man.  I got to hear this tomorrow.  Well, we got to play this one out, don't we?  Yes, we do. 
[01:23:30]  So, we got some amazing, uh, Ron Efez audio.  Yes.  As the drama continues.  Mm-mm-mm.  You bet it does.  Got some funny people in studio.  Funny people.  Bob Kelly and Rich Voss at the same time.  My God.  We're talking about, uh, babies.  Talking about babies hitting their heads.  We were talking about, uh, mental illness.  All this stuff during the break. 
[01:24:00]  You missed out on it.  It was great.  It was terrific stuff.  Amazing.  Well, you're watching the baby.  My daughter, when she was about four.  Yeah.  We're walking into this big glass door.  You know how sliding doors slide?  Sliding doors slide.  Sliding doors slide.  Yes.  Breaking news.  First dumb joke.  Yes.  Breaking news, everyone.  Sliding doors slide.  Let me explain this.  I'm trying to put this in categories.  In categories.  In perspective.  Put it in categories.  In perspective.  So she's walking with her hand going along the glass window. 
[01:24:30]  Uh-huh.  And then the sliding door came and sucked her hand between the two doors.  Oh, yeah.  Her whole arm.  Uh-huh.  Hey, what do you mean?  Oh, you're watching your five-year-old?  Are we trading war stories?  No, no.  My son, the exact same thing happened, but in an elevator door.  Oh.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yeah, but no, it got stuck that way.  He put his hand on the elevator door as it was opening, and it just went right into the  thing.  I had to push the elevator with both hands to try to get it out.  Yeah, but you could buy your son a new hand. 
[01:25:00]  You know, you got that kind of money.  Cunt?  Cunt.  I said you got that kind of money.  You know, he didn't know if he was going to say cash or money.  Right.  And he just fucking panicked.  You should warm up your mouth before you get on air.  Exactly.  Shut up.  Cuck.  And then a shotgun.  So what happened with the sliding glass door?  That's an easy fix.  Yeah, I had to fucking pull the door back.  But I was under the gun because it's an elevator door.  Oh, man.  That elevator door doesn't want to, like, stay open. 
[01:25:30]  It's going to start closing.  And I don't know what that was going to do.  I don't know if it was going to bring it back out all night or not.  It closed, and then the elevator started going up.  Oh, my God.  You see the arm get ripped off like a...  I know, that lady got cut in half.  Right.  That lady got cut in half.  She got caught in one of those faulty...  The elevator, the sensor didn't work.  This was in Lower Manhattan, I think.  And people had been complaining about the elevator, and it grabbed her.  And you never just run in, and it started going up, man.  And it just sucked her up against the wall.  It was terrible.  It cut her in half.  Were people in the elevator watching? 
[01:26:00]  Yes.  Yes.  I want to talk to one of those people.  You're such a great vine.  Remember the one where the guy was coming in, and it chopped his head off, and the elevator  fell into the basement, and there were two women, and the guy's head now in the elevator  in the basement, and they couldn't get out.  It was awful.  It was just trapped in the elevator.  It was doing Jimmy Durant the impression the whole time.  Ah, cha-cha-cha-cha.  After a while, they're just playing catch with it, just to pass the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Socking it around.  Making different faces with his mouth. 
[01:26:30]  I'm angry.  I'm sad.  I'm mad.  How about you want to interview one of those people?  Whether we're stuck in the elevator with the head.  It's like the train stuff when the guy gets cut in half, but he's still alive, and  they have to call his family in, because once they move the train, just innards fall out.  Yeah, yeah.  Why couldn't you build a little house for him?  Just keep him there forever.  Just move the train?  Yeah, just keep him there forever.  No, don't even move the train.  You have to leave the train, so why not just build something?  Build something around him.  Let him live for a little while. 
[01:27:00]  Well, I worked with this.  And who decides, okay, look, it's time to kill you?  In the future, they'd have some laser gun that'd just glue laser, just come like a  robot, just glue his torso together so they can just pick him up and throw him on something.  Well, this magic guy, he's a major.  He does a bit, and he uses...  What's his name?  No, I don't want to give it away, but he uses a guy that has half a body and walks on his  arm.  Criss Angel.  Criss Angel.  No, not Criss Angel.  No, it's Criss Angel.  No, he can't leave his room in the day in the hotel because people will see the half 
[01:27:30]  a body.  So at night, they cut him in half?  Or they cut him into quarters, like from the face, lengthwise?  No, but it's fucking creepy.  So he doesn't have legs?  He has nothing under his torso.  Yeah, I know who you mean.  I've seen this.  There's a few of those guys.  There's a few of those guys.  Yeah, they're great handshakes.  They're very strong guys.  Yeah.  Stepping dog shit a lot.  How do you piss?  They've got to tie their t-shirts in a knot.  They might have a dick and balls at the bottom.  They all look like gay guys in fucking 1970, California. 
[01:28:00]  Could just be a urethra hole right in the front.  Oh, damn.  That's the smell of that.  Those shirts are like trash bags.  Jerry Springer had one of those guys, right?  Yeah.  So they shit.  So do they have dick and balls?  I don't know.  I'd love to know.  No, they're not dick and balls.  Is that your main concern?  Yeah.  No, they're pretty much cut right below the belly button.  So they don't have a dick and balls, but their asshole is somewhere, right?  They have to shit.  Yeah, well, it's not an asshole.  It falls out the hole at the bottom.  Yeah, but they have a bag. 
[01:28:30]  What did you just say?  It falls out of them.  What does?  It's shit.  What happened?  What's going on?  Where's Sam?  There's some stuff been going on with him.  What happened?  Oh, no.  I mean, I'm...  Oh, the thing?  You want to do the thing?  Yeah, where is he?  There's all this fucking buzz around here.  Yes.  What's going on?  A hullabaloo.  What happened?  It's a hullabaloo.  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's been a whole thing with Sam and Robert Fez and Kate Quorn.  I'm just going to point at him.  Look at his legs.  Look at his cartoonish open legs.  And by the way, Bobby and Rich are doing a podcast tonight. 
[01:29:00]  My Wife Hates Me live.  No, no, no.  That's next Tuesday.  Oh, shit.  Oh, sorry.  Next Tuesday, it's live at the Village Underground.  My Wife Hates Me.  Rich and Bonnie's podcast is going to be live.  Moderated by, like, Ron Bennington.  Yeah, he's going to be a guest marriage counselor.  Okay.  And it's going to be a stand-up, the podcast.  And then Q&A at the end.  Great.  Yeah.  Village Underground.  Tuesday night.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  If that works, you could tour that shit.  Yeah.  Well, we did.  What were the stand-ups? 
[01:29:30]  Rich and Bonnie.  Well, what's his name going to open?  Well, who else, though?  Dan Soda's open.  Dan Soda.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then we'll do a few minutes.  We did a live podcast in L.A.  We did at the podcast festival.  Oh, God.  And what?  Why would you do a podcast festival?  I don't know.  Because it was fun.  It was a lot.  Horrible.  I'm sorry.  Why would you fucking rollerblade, you fucking homo?  I don't know.  You like to do it.  Don't come up with something I did 10 years ago, by the way.  Why would you take pictures of a fucking son?  I'm just saying we were invited.  So we went.  Wow.  We don't get invited to a radio together 20 years. 
[01:30:00]  We never went to a radio festival.  Because nobody likes you there.  Why would you go?  You've never been invited.  All right.  Well, I keep it festive.  You want this one.  Nobody wants to see you in a hotel lobby in the morning.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Look at this guy.  What do I do?  I like a lot of podcasts, but I can't imagine going to a podcast festival.  Well, it was fun.  And then there was a lot of big podcasts, Maren and Dana Gould and Isha Tyler, Benz, all the 
[01:30:30]  West Coast.  And from the East Coast, all the West Coast.  Dana Gould and who else?  Isha.  Isha Tyler.  Isha Tyler?  It's Aisha.  Aisha.  I said Aisha.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Just a lot of them.  And when we did it, we had two marriage counselors come up, Andy Kindler and Jake Johansson.  And it was fucking great.  It was a lot of fun.  You know, they came up.  Kindler was fucking on fire.  He's just one of the funniest men alive. 
[01:31:00]  He really is.  Is he really?  I don't know much about him.  He's really funny.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  I hear he's nice.  I want to see the...  I mean, I want to hear...  I got to hear this.  What's going on, Sam?  Sam?  I'm just asking you.  There's all this buzz around this.  What mic is that?  Hullible, as Anthony said.  Hullible.  Seven.  Seven.  Okay.  You are a producer.  Yeah.  You're exaggerating, by the way.  So...  So, um...  So, the Village Underground, right?  Yeah.  On Tuesday night. 
[01:31:30]  Tuesday night.  7.30.  Some tickets available, so they're going to go fast, though.  It's only a 200-seater.  We're already sold.  And it's nice and early.  I'm going to go.  7.30.  I can go to early things.  Yeah.  I'll do it.  Rich always invites me out to dinner at 10 o'clock at night.  And I'm like, I can't...  At least you get invited.  Why can't we eat dinner earlier?  Well, we were supposed to eat dinner one day earlier, but something came up.  That's okay.  No, earlier in the night.  Yeah, we were.  Why do I never get invited?  Because you don't have a spouse, and you don't have time to go buy one. 
[01:32:00]  It's a couple's thing.  Yeah, but I know all your spouses well enough to be a couple's thing.  You can come to dinner with us any time you want.  You always had a town.  I can go to dinner with you and your wife and you and your wife and be totally comfortable  with the couple's.  Well, but last time we had...  You come over to my house all the time.  I invite you over on Sundays.  Yeah, of course.  Sausage soup.  Because I know your spouse is well enough where it's not awkward.  Sausage soup sounds awesome.  It's the best thing on earth is rice soup.  It's fucking amazing.  When am I getting that invite?  We're moving to the house Sunday, and as soon as the new house is open, we're going to 
[01:32:30]  have a nice barbecue.  I'm going to have an O&A Q.  No, I want an individual bite.  Like I said, it's an Opie night, and then I'm going to have a...  Thank you.  It's an Opie night.  You should call it a barbecue, and then just do Bob Kelly things.  Barbecue.  A barbecue.  Dad, you knock down.  I cook the steaks.  You throw your steak, you grill, boom, your gas.  Hopefully, you turn the gas on, boom.  Yeah, you forget to, you know, start a fire, boom.  It's not as big as yours, Anthony, but it's what I got.  I like the suburbia thing.  Oh, that awful discussion. 
[01:33:00]  Cold, you know, it's quiet.  You can hear the birds.  You don't think that...  You wouldn't like that discussion?  No.  You know, when you're out here, it's out of the city, dude.  You guys, your yard.  Oh, funny.  Just pontificating.  That's the exact thing I repeat over and over so I don't kill myself.  You sit, you have a yard and stuff.  I mean, look at this.  It's quiet.  There's no noise.  Yeah, the birds.  Dude, listen.  Listen.  When was the last time you heard the birds?  Listen.  That's what I'm paying for. 
[01:33:30]  Those are cicadas, dude.  You hear them?  Cicadas.  Aren't you scared that you're going to get shot by hunters?  It's not loose.  It's not nice at all.  Are we doing this audio or what?  Yeah, I guess we should.  Should we do this audio?  I mean, this is going well, though.  Who are you asking?  You, Sammy boy.  I'm not going to make the call as to whether or not you should do audio.  You're the executive producer.  So, I don't know.  This needs a big setup.  Take us back to the beginning of this really quickly. 
[01:34:00]  The cake horn?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Well, Fez was mad at management because they told him he couldn't go somewhere in the building.  He yelled that they needed to shut their cake horns.  Right.  Found out that that was not a term.  No.  Doesn't mean anything.  And Ron, because he's brilliant, went with it.  Ron went with it.  Cake horn was trending around America.  Number one trending topic in the United States two days in a row.  And Fez just would not let it go and realize that, wow, now it's something else and maybe  I should just relax and enjoy the fact that cake horn is now a trending topic. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  And then...  And he claimed it was a gay thing because they wouldn't let him near the fishbowl.  Right.  And then yesterday, he went on, Ron and Fez, and said he was mad at me because I was  bullying him because you guys listen to cake horn audio.  And then you brought it to our attention, which is not true.  When my Twitter explodes with everyone talking about Ron and Fez and cake horn, I think...  You've got to find out what it is.  I think I don't need Sam Roberts.  Right.  You can say that again. 
[01:35:00]  Can't we tell Jess that her lawyer said that?  So then Fez was mad at you because he thought you brought it to our attention.  Right.  Because, of course, when we get the audio, it's not going to be pretty for Fez.  Well, of course not.  No.  So he's mad at you.  Right.  And you're on some kind of secret list of his.  And then he said he had put me on his list.  Right.  And would not go into detail as to what that meant.  Well, we have new audio from yesterday, and I swear I had no idea this happened and that 
[01:35:30]  you absolutely brought this to our attention.  I did not.  With a big laugh.  Yes.  But he's like, you've got to hear this.  All right.  Cake horn I knew about.  This, I'm telling you, I didn't know about.  But I'm not the one who brought it to your attention.  Have fun with Fez.  Oh, God.  Who brought it to our attention?  The same guy who cut the cliffs.  Who?  Oh, Eric?  That nagle kid.  He rocked that nagle kid.  Oh, the nagle kid.  Oh, the nagle kid.  Oh, no.  Hobbes McGillicuddy.  Does Ron set up the audio nice here?  Uh, E-Rock cut the cliffs.  But, uh...  Oh, nice pass the buck.  This...  Put it all on the record. 
[01:36:00]  This audio's really creepy.  Yeah.  Uh, well, the backstory is that, uh...  For Christmas, I think, Fez gave Ron a matchbook from the first place they met that I guess  Fez had been saving all these years.  Was that the creepy Christmas gift they alluded to?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  And it was a matchbook?  So, Fez meets Ron.  Fez does such a great night, he saves a matchbook.  From that day.  And then years, years later, he framed it and gave it to Ronnie as a Christmas present?  I'm talking decades later, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  When did he give it to, uh, Ron, as a Christmas present?  This year.  Jesus.  So, uh, easily 20 years.  Easily.  After having the matchbook.  Yeah.  That's a nice gift.  I don't think that's weird.  It's like, hey, this is what our friendship started.  What's Ronnie gonna do with that, honestly?  He put it on your frame.  He's gonna hang it up somewhere.  It became the radio show, so I would say that's okay.  It's kind of interesting.  What is it?  People come on.  What's that?  Oh, that's the match.  I met my friend.  He became your radio partner.  Oh, man.  Yeah, but what if you found out that, like, the day Ant had met you, Ant had saved a matchbook 
[01:37:00]  from the place where he met you.  Ant saved his ponytail.  I know.  Exactly.  He gave you a racket wrench.  Here's my rat tail.  It would be more amazing to me if I found the day Anthony met me there was actually beer  left in the bar when he left.  It's not a sober day.  It was a terrible joke.  I'm sorry.  It wasn't a good joke.  I know you do, but it was a weak joke.  Oh, it's okay.  So whether you think it's a nice thing or not, what happened yesterday is beyond creepy.  Yes.  Okay.  So with that, here's some audio from yesterday's Ron and Fez show. 
[01:37:30]  Let me set this up for any new listeners.  A few years ago, Watley gave me a Christmas gift of a pack of matches that he had framed.  And I looked at it, and I know it was this, like, little club in Florida, and he goes,  this is from the night that we met.  I saved it all these years.  I was very weirded out by it because I'm like, that's not something a man does.  Saves a pack of matches, A. 
[01:38:00]  B, said I saved a pack of matches because we met that night, and I had a good time,  and I always wanted to remember it.  And I've said, and like two decades went by.  And then at least two decades.  And then he gives me the pack of matches, and it weirded me out.  And then to find out the truth, he was given those matches in 2002 because somebody went  back and found an old clip from WNEW. 
[01:38:30]  Where's the clip?  We got it.  I'm letting that sit there for a second.  So he lied about the...  Yeah.  And then someone actually gave him...  He told Ronnie that he's had these matches the whole time.  He created a moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I want to hear the clip, though, because I want to see if it's a misinterpretation of  it.  It might not.  Fez might be telling the truth, and maybe the guy...  Maybe the guy's lying.  Yeah, exactly.  We're twisting a clip.  Here's the WNEW clip of Fez from 2002, I believe.  A friend of mine actually collects matchbooks.  He has them on a display in a display case, hanging up in his living room. 
[01:39:00]  I thought, this is the most retarded thing ever.  He gave me one, Ronnie.  This is not too long ago.  From the club where we first met, me and you.  No way.  Yeah.  All right.  I should have saved it for a gift.  Yeah, that would have been perfect.  I would have cried.  I should have saved it for Valentine's.  This friend of yours?  Yeah.  Gay guy?  Yeah, I think so.  So, there's the truth that someone gave him those matches, then he's saying to me, I should 
[01:39:30]  have gave it to you as a gift, and me making the remark, oh yeah, I would have cried, and  then find out the truth that he fucking rattled them up his ass for a few years, put them in  this shitty little fucking display case and handed them to me.  Wow.  I held this ridiculous book of matches in my ass.  So, the N.E.W.  Birthright.  Birthright.  So, how did he respond to this?  Oh, that's why we're here right now. 
[01:40:00]  Is he in the studio right there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Was he just, he must have been.  So, the N.E.W.  clips from 2002, so Fezzy got the matches from 2002.  Yeah.  12 years ago.  But he didn't actually, you know, get the matchbook himself when he first met Ron.  It's still a long time.  It's still 12 years to hold matches.  And I've done that.  I've had gifts from other people, something lying around the house.  Hey, we're going over here.  I'm going to grab that.  Give me that foot.  Give me that ceramic foot.  I have a gift question.  Can I ask you a gift question? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Say you did a benefit, and you got a watch as a gift from the benefit, and you're never  going to wear that watch.  I already went to Macy's.  Oh, you did?  Yes, I did.  Oh, shit.  Are you kidding me?  I already went to Macy's.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, no, you fucking pricks.  Is this what I think it is?  I didn't.  I still have it.  I saw the Macy's tag.  I still have it.  You know what?  What?  Nice certificate.  A gift certificate.  I still have it, only because of a memento, and that's why I want to keep it, but I'll 
[01:41:00]  never wear it.  So what do you do?  You just hold on to it and never wear it?  Well, not you.  I think some things you just keep as a memento.  I went to Macy's.  I'm not a watch guy, but I'm a shirt guy.  I like shirts.  Jesus.  My God.  Does that answer your question?  That's heartless.  Garbage.  That's a little heartless.  What?  I didn't do anything.  Jesus Christ.  I know not one person has the watch on here today. 
[01:41:30]  I don't have mine.  I don't have mine.  I never bought mine.  I didn't get mine.  You didn't get one?  No.  Maureen has it.  She hasn't given it to me.  Where's everyone else's watches?  Well, I'm not going to...  Mine's in the box.  I got it at home.  For real.  I'll bring it in.  I'll bring it Monday night to the show.  I believe you.  He doesn't...  You got a watch?  Did you get one?  Yes, I did.  I still have it.  I'm going to save it.  That's what I'm going to do.  Save it.  It's a gift.  It's the thought that counts.  It's a gift.  I love the thought.  And I love my new shirts. 
[01:42:00]  You exchanged that thought for a Henley.  Jeez.  A nice three-button fucking pullover.  You know what I'll do?  Maybe I'll just steal Bonnie's and return her.  She got one?  Yeah.  She went on.  All right, and then...  No, I'm kidding.  It was a joke.  And then you guys could share the one watch, and it looks like you both still have the watch.  Oh, that's true.  So you could get away with that.  Oh, God.  Here's Fez trying to explain the matches.  Oh, no.  That was real...  That was a real gift.  I had those matches all... 
[01:42:30]  I didn't get them in 2002.  Then why didn't you act like that guy...  Why wouldn't you say, that guy has something wonderful?  Old matches.  Because he was keeping a complete collection of matches from every bar he ever went to.  Not something special that I thought was between you and me.  There wasn't anything between you and me.  You got them matches from a listener.  No, I didn't get the matches from the listener.  He tried to...  I just found out the fucking truth now.  He tried to give me the matches.  I thought it was a really nice gift. 
[01:43:00]  How's that a really nice gift?  I thought it was something special.  You took matches off a fucking listener and you handed them to me.  I didn't take matches off of the listener.  Ron, go pack Joe a listener, send me these cigarettes.  Would you like one?  That's odd that you would feel so close to me to give me that smoke.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you could hear it.  How is this Sam's fault?  Sam's had nothing to do with this.  Well, Sam...  Well, he brought this door to him.  He's exploiting him.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Exploitation.  Um, yeah.  Sam, Sam...  Are we in still? 
[01:43:30]  Because it gets way worse.  Yeah, I feel bad for Fez.  I think he gave a nice gift.  Is he crying?  It gets really...  Before you go any further.  I can't take my...  I can't take crying.  My kid's crying now.  I fucking...  They're crying.  Your audience is...  Yeah.  That's one thing with a kid, but then a grown man crying is a little...  You're still moisturizing your tattoos?  This new one.  Oh, okay.  It's not new anymore.  This one is just three weeks old.  No, it's not.  This one's three weeks old.  Yeah.  I thought I've seen that one before.  No, you saw that one.  Do you...  What is that? 
[01:44:00]  Moisturizing.  What is it?  Moisturizer in a fucking aspirin bottle?  No, it's in my high blood pressure bottles.  I got so many of them.  Why don't you just...  They come in small bottles, you fucking loser.  You really are a nickel chaser.  Why don't you fucking put this...  Why don't you put this lotion on so you can get through the tunnel going home?  You fucking asshole.  Shut your fucking mouth.  Don't stop.  Slow down.  This is where you ruin it.  You killed it.  You got a good one.  Everybody's laughing.  You start...  You start getting wet mouth. 
[01:44:30]  You fucking fake teeth that start slipping on your fucking thin lips.  He does ruin it, doesn't he?  It does.  It's like pushing a fence over fucking ice.  Fucking stupid Nicorette gum fucks him up.  Yeah, what else is that?  I don't see this being a Sam's fault so far.  You want to take a vote?  Who wants to continue?  Because this gets ugly.  It gets way, way worse.  This gets way worse.  Oh, God.  All right.  So Ron's convinced that, you know, Fez didn't save this matchbook all these years. 
[01:45:00]  He got it from a listener in 2002, saved it for 14, 12 years, and then gave it to Ronnie.  I'm just hearing, too.  But the story's different, that's all.  This gift was actually given to Ron like three years ago, not this Christmas.  Okay.  So nine years ago.  All right.  Here we go.  But I'm sure that, you know, that's...  Sure, it's stock Fez.  Try to find anything that tries to make him look bad.  No one will be happy until I'm dead.  So, fine.  Believe whatever anyone wants.  That was a gift that I kept, and I thought it was really nice, and I gave it to you. 
[01:45:30]  And now someone has to...  I know it made you uncomfortable, and I apologize for that.  But now someone has to try to fuck that up, too.  Someone has to fuck up you making me feel uncomfortable?  No.  Just any...  Anything I try to do, someone out there has to try to make it look like the biggest fuck-up ever.  Fezzy.  Trust me.  The heart attack is coming.  I can feel it.  I'll be gone soon. 
[01:46:00]  Okay, Elizabeth, I'm coming.  Just sounds like...  Holy...  Is this a shoot or a work?  Yes.  It's a shoot.  Well, then why would someone do a fucking job if it's going to give you a heart attack?  And then I promise...  That's what they want me to do.  And then I promise you this.  There'll be no fucking mention of you on the show.  None.  If that's where you go with it.  It won't fucking come up again.  Okay?  It's done. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  It sounds like every night in my kitchen.  Oh, is that it?  Just my wife crying.  Yeah.  We got it.  We got it.  Yeah.  Stop trying to make it a serious statement there.  Stop trying to make it a real moment.  You were trying to track a joke, and no one laughed.  You just completely didn't laugh because it was a point.  He's not actually just making a point.  Hold on.  No one's making a point because his eyes are opening.  That's what happens when you talk.  Your eyes stay open.  Let me tell you something.  Every finger looks like a thumb.  I hate it. 
[01:47:00]  I hate your hands.  They fucking make me just stare at them because they're so fucking odd.  You don't like his non-picks.  You're pigs in the blanket?  I fucking hate you.  You don't like his little stiff hands?  No.  He's got fucking gargoyle fingers.  His fucking thumbs look like fat toes.  I hate it.  Fucking hair.  So I guess that's it, Sam.  No, it gets worse.  Oh, good.  The mat?  The mat?  Are you still in? 
[01:47:30]  Should I?  Fuck, dude.  Are you in, Bobby?  Bobby!  I feel bad, man.  I like you.  He sounds very sad.  Can you just look around the room and there's faces.  People are concerned.  Yeah.  The only one that's just smiling is this disc.  Disconnected hunk of shit boss.  No, I don't.  40 years in the business is just fucking disconnected.  Listen to me.  You're 100% wrong.  He doesn't know how to handle affection or cussing.  You're 100% wrong.  I fucking like fashion.  Give me a hug. 
[01:48:00]  Give me a hug.  Give me a hug.  He's like, my arms are going to reach around.  It creeps like, there's something wrong with him.  He doesn't like being hugged.  It's called autism and being repeatedly raped as a child.  He can't take a hug from a friend.  I'm trying to touch him.  He just cowers away.  It's just gross.  Keep your fucking heart and hands off me.  I hug Norton every time I see him.  I miss this little fucking bastard.  Yes, he does.  He can't fucking touch boss. 
[01:48:30]  I've never gotten anything from him.  I like a good hug.  Do you want to have it?  I like man hugs.  I like fucking hugs.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  I'm fucking, I feel so sad for facing this because.  No, you know what?  You think that you're so, you, you.  No, I don't think I'm supposed to.  As a true sociopath, you're, you're doing an impression of human emotions.  No, listen to me.  First of all, doctor fucking whatever.  Good one.  What?  What dummy couldn't call me something after doctor? 
[01:49:00]  Dr. Detroit.  Retard.  That's smart.  Okay.  One, because.  Yeah.  I don't want to get into it.  I mean, I know what he's going through.  You do?  Oh, shut up.  I don't.  What are you kidding me?  You're wrong.  I can't imagine yourself.  Huh?  Explain.  I used to smoke.  What do you mean you know what he's going through?  Explain.  Because I suffer from anxiety and I could see.  Anxiety.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  And he's got, he's got, whatever.  And, you know, it was a touching moment.  He was trying to be nice.  It's like, would you fucking guys.  You guys, when you bring you guys something, you break it.  You don't appreciate.  You think.  I appreciate the watch.  I just appreciate the watch.  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about the watch.  Other things.  Like you think, like someone's given a gift and you think it's better to get a laugh out  of it and smash it, but he really fucking truly was given a gift and some fucking dumb caller  is trying to degrade his gift.  I know.  All right.  Let's continue because I don't know what he's talking about over there. 
[01:50:00]  What the fuck are you talking about?  Ron has had it.  Okay.  Scott, you're on the Ron and Fez show.  If Fez kept one book, he kept both.  So if he's telling the truth, he'll be able to bring in the other book tomorrow.  I'm not having anything more than that.  Trust me.  I don't want to give anybody a fucking heart attack.  That a pack of matches or a fucking thing could give someone a heart attack.  That's the last thing I want.  Sam, don't go running off to O&A with this.  You'll kill him.  He'll die.  So he did. 
[01:50:30]  Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  What the fuck, man?  That was a murderer.  If I knew that Ronnie said that, I wouldn't be playing these fucking clips.  No.  As he pushes the button again.  Exactly.  He still has his finger on the button.  Because he hasn't heard this before.  Well, we did commit to it, so we've got to finish it out.  And why would Ron give Sam that suggestion on the air?  Right.  Oh, right.  Here's Tom.  Tom, you're on the Ron and Fez show.  Well, I'll just say Team Sam, and then I'll say, yeah, the thing I'd like from the TV show is... 
[01:51:00]  Don't even bring it up.  That's too stupid.  That's true.  We're dealing with life and death now.  Purple Guy, you're on the Ron and Fez show.  Hang on.  I've got to put down my cake horn.  Hey, I want to ask Fez, now that he's a big, fat liar, are we supposed to believe him on his...  Please, don't bring his name up.  Austin, you're on the Ron and Fez show.  Ron, I know I can't name him, but there's two different people in that room.  Todd and Fez.  Todd gave Fez the matches.  You're killing him. 
[01:51:30]  Marty in Texas, you're on the Ron and Fez show.  Oh, poor Fez.  Stop it.  Oh, boy, the listeners are brutal, huh?  Ronnie's evil, man.  He is evil.  Oh, yeah.  Why are these guys waving at us?  They're big stars.  They see some big stars in the room.  They all dress the same.  They all have the same Perry Ellis fucking shirt on.  Yeah.  Yeah, those guys that fucking take the train from Long Island. 
[01:52:00]  Those guys.  Stupid slip-on brown.  Stupid shoes.  Loafers.  Yeah.  Leigh jeans.  Loafers.  Leigh jeans.  Perry Ellis fucking mock turtleneck.  Get the haircut.  It's super cuts.  Or some sports cut.  That new thing.  What do you think?  Everyone's rich?  Huh?  What's a sports cut?  It's, uh...  They got fucking TVs with all the games on it.  It looks like they're fucking, uh...  It's all hot chicks, kind of.  What do I know?  I go.  I get the haircut.  I go.  You got a regular joke.  Yeah, what do I know? 
[01:52:30]  Here's 12 bucks.  Same style since, like, 19 fucking 55.  Yeah.  Yeah, just a little off the top.  A little trim.  We have one more clip from Ron and Fez.  This ends it.  All right.  Uh, Dave, you're on the Ron and Fez show.  Uh, yes, Ronnie.  I would just like to know what changed.  Uh, we were supposed to move to a new channel.  I mean, we got Shelby.  But as far as I can see, it's all the same.  Fez melting down on the listeners and not going with the flow and crying.  And then, how are we going to do an April Fez? 
[01:53:00]  What's going to happen?  You know, if he would have gave a sentimental cry but not threatened us with his death, I'd feel completely different.  But I can't be responsible if this is all too stressful.  If, you know, Sam running back with a tape is going to kill him.  I can't be part of that.  Uh, Josh, Massachusetts.  If I had an item and someone came to me and said, hey, I got this item from there, and I had the same item, I would have brought it up. 
[01:53:30]  There was no mention of, hey, I got the same item.  That's the only thing I'm going to say about it.  You'd think you would at least bring it up.  But there was no mention of it.  He did get busted today, and then he threatened his own death like it would be my fault if he died.  Let me just officially say, that pack of matches was the greatest present I ever got.  I sit and I stare out of it, and I think about our great friendship.  Live forever, my friend.  That's what I say.  Uh, Dusty, you're on the run of Fez's show.  I'm on a bit of delay.  Is Fez still in the studio? 
[01:54:00]  I am not going to bring that up.  I don't want to make him feel upset.  I don't want to kill him.  I love him far too much to see him die over something quite so silly.  Okay.  I don't want to feel like I'm blowing this out of proportion, but I feel like I'm saving his life right now.  That this is some type of preventative service.  I hope I haven't gone too far with that.  But I consider this preventative surgery.  Ron, you define codependence. 
[01:54:30]  I really do.  I really do.  There you go.  Oh, he is fucking hilarious.  There you go.  Saving life.  That's really a strange one.  Wow.  Well, that wasn't Sam, didn't really, you know.  Well, Sam brings it here, and that's what the problem is.  Sam's a double agent.  Yeah, but it's bringing a lot of new listeners to Raw Dog, though.  That's true.  Raw Dog, noon.  Ronnie's on at noon today.  At the price of somebody's life. 
[01:55:00]  Well, hopefully not.  Ronnie says how much he loves the gift, and then everything's fine.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  The second you goof on it, it could be an event.  Lives are at stake.  Right.  Wouldn't the original gift come with papers?  Um, what?  What?  What do you know, like when you buy?  All right, they're not all good.  How about if one of them would be?  You mean a certificate of authenticity?  That's what the fuck I said.  Papers.  I didn't have to go through no big words. 
[01:55:30]  As long as the tag is still on it, you're good.  At Macy's.  You're good.  Oh, yeah?  I can't believe you.  Why?  How many shirts?  Two?  A few.  $200 a watch.  Is it?  Yeah.  Look at his eyes lit up.  I got a few out of it.  How much you got?  Hmm?  How much you got?  It's about right.  That's exactly right.  That's $200.  It's about right.  Of course the Jew looked it up.  Oh, really?  I looked it up.  Who ran to Macy's in the next fucking millionaire plus 200? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, because I'm not.  I don't have the Jew guilt.  That's the only reason why you haven't done it yet.  Yeah, and you don't have that guilt.  Oh, I have a conscience.  Really?  Maybe you could have bought your kid something with it.  He's got enough stuff.  Yeah, that's true.  I've seen it.  The kid's good.  The kid has too much shit.  You bought everything for your kid, Bobby?  No.  Not yet.  You will.  A bunch of toys, but the same toy over and over. 
[01:56:30]  You want to play with something?  You play with a hammer and nails.  There you go.  Bill Learn.  He found his ding-ding the other day.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Ding Norton's mouth?  Jesus.  I hope that comes back to haunt you.  I really do.  Wow.  I hope you get caught molesting somebody, and they use that as evidence.  I'll be right in there.  Yes, he did say that, Your Honor.  And it shocked me, too.  Oh, I told him about your kid?  What?  I didn't know you were talking about your kid.  Oh, shut up.  Of course you knew.  Yeah, shut up, you hilarious fucking thumb-fingered asshole. 
[01:57:00]  Will you please go and get regular ointment for your fucking tattoo?  Fucking Jim, you're just a fucking slumming Jew.  Yeah.  That's all you are.  How about you get some invisible ink?  I hope the industry hears you when you're calling me a slumming Jew.  Jimmy, there you are.  Yeah.  It would have been called vanishing cream.  Okay.  Not invisible ink.  Okay, that's hard. 
[01:57:30]  I just want wrists to disappear.  And by the way, if the industry hears them bashing you, they'll be like, who is he talking  about?  Why can't we just be friends?  Holy shit.  Fucking poor Fez is crying.  Crying?  He's fucking gonna die.  He's threatening to have another heart attack.  It's way worse in here.  People just go with it.  It's so fucking...  Why can't he just go with shit?  Do you understand?  He's crying out for help.  Yeah, whatever.  He's been doing that for years.  Well, yeah, but yeah, it's been going on for a long time.  We got Neil deGrasse Tyson coming in. 
[01:58:00]  We're gonna talk about, like, the Cosmos.  What, the soccer team?  You got any questions about the universe, Rich?  Yeah, why are these two still on?  For the record, he's pointing at Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  What do you know about the universe?  What do you know about the universe?  What do I know about it?  Yeah.  Some planets hanging out.  Good.  Yeah.  A lot of stars.  Light years away. 
[01:58:30]  Mars is not a planet anymore.  Mars?  Pluto, Pluto, Pluto, Pluto.  I made a mistake, Pluto.  That's messed up.  All right.  Pluto.  I covered it.  Pluto.  Pluto's not a planet anymore.  You hear about Pluto?  That's messed up.  Pluto was taken out as a planet.  They put Bobby in.  All right.  That's pretty good.  His fucking reading glasses are broken, too.  I know.  What are you doing?  What use could there be for them? 
[01:59:00]  Reading glasses.  That's like my fucking poker.  Arrgh.  Thanks.  I think I had it since.  Do you need help?  Huh?  You need help.  I need a lot of help.  Do you need money?  What the fuck?  Yes, you have to do my taxes this year.  I put your fingerprints on one of your glasses.  It's crappy.  What do you need to fix those?  He's got a toothpick.  The screw fell out.  Toothpick?  We might have a thing.  You're going to fucking fix it with a toothpick?  What is this?  It's 1920?  They're $4 at Dwayne Reed, you fucking tattooed asshole.  They were a dollar at the dollar store, you jackass.  Why don't you buy another one? 
[01:59:30]  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Buy another one.  Yeah, you're helping your cars.  Yeah.  Who the fuck goes to a dollar store?  Someone's got a couple dollars in their pocket.  Oh, God.  Here's the thing.  You buy these glasses.  I've got like 10 of them.  You lose them, you break them.  Fuck this.  Buy one pair and take care of them.  Yeah.  Really?  Because they break.  You lose them.  They're reading them.  Listen, we've got to go to break because Neil LaGrasse Tyson is going to be in.  That's great.  One of the smartest men in America.  In the world.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:00:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  141 on my IQ test.  Oh, I did another one.  Some guy sent me from O&A.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A tough one.  A real tough.  100 is average.  And I got 120 on this one.  100 is average.  Where is it?  Why didn't you bring it in?  This is bullshit.  I'll do it.  I got, I got, ask the guy.  I sent you back the results.  Where is it?  Could you redo it on?  I guarantee you won't get 100 if you redo the test.  No, I got 120.  I know.  I'm saying you won't even get 100.  I'm not going to do it now.  Could you do it by yourself in a room and then send this?  No, I did it in a tree house with three people watching. 
[02:00:30]  You fucking idiot.  Where else would I do it?  In my room by myself.  I didn't have, I didn't have help and tutors there.  It's an IQ test.  We got what you meant.  Fucking wordy asshole.  You don't need any more examples.  You don't need breaks on your fucking choppers.  Fucking whoosh.  What I'm saying is, did you do it by yourself and we're supposed to trust you?  Or did you go to a place and have it done legitimately where other people saw you take the test?  Oh, listen to me, you fucking idiot.  I'm not a genius like you. 
[02:01:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm just asking questions.  I'm telling you.  Where did you do it?  The guy sent it to me online.  Where did you do it?  In my fucking...  What Holiday Inn Express did you do it?  I did it in my kitchen.  By yourself.  Yeah.  You concentrate.  You get a piece of paper, pencil, and you figure it out.  And I'm not going to lie.  A hundred was average, and I got a hundred and twenty on this one.  What did they do?  It's a tough one.  I got it on...  Shapes.  Like that shit.  All that shit, yeah.  A hundred was average. 
[02:01:30]  A hundred and fifty was blithering idiots.  He got a one twenty.  He doesn't understand what you were doing there.  Whoa.  Went backwards.  Oh, for two.  So sweet.  One more strike.  All right.  Where are you going to be, Rich?  Big plug time.  This Saturday, Mohegan Sun Theater.  And Tuesday, big live podcast.  Rich Voss, Bonnie McFarlane, My Wife Hates Me.  Special guest, marriage counselor, Ron Bennington.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:02:00]  And Bobby's producing it.  Dan Soda's doing a warm-up.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  7.30.  Tickets still available, but they're going fast.  At ComedyCellar.com.  So if you're going to get tickets, ComedyCellar.com.  And this weekend, I'm at the Bushnell Theater in Hartford, Connecticut.  What did you call it?  Theata?  Theata.  Theata.  Bushnell.  It's nice where you're working.  Rich.  Friday night, isn't it?  Yeah, it's nice.  Thanks for coming in.  It was a good scene.  Yeah, that'll really happen, okay?  All right, sports junkies.  They're telling us that you have to come.  I got kicked out last week. 
[02:02:30]  Where did I get kicked out of last week?  Oh, when Cowhead said goodbye.  It was so funny.  Well, thanks.  You did a great job.  Thanks.  Oh, that was it.  But I did enough time on that.  Oh, okay.  I fucking love you guys.  He loves you guys.  I hope he doesn't know who he is.  I don't really know who he is.  I hope he doesn't really know who he is.  He knows you.  He was in your studio recently.  That's what I heard.  I apologize.  I'm not trash in the guy.  I just don't know him.  You were on Twitter that day.  Yeah, you know him.  Cowhead.  He's out of Ontario. 
[02:03:00]  No.  California.  No, I know, but that's where I'm going to be this week.  So I'm fucking shark fest in here.  You got to get the plugs.  This weekend, the Improv in Ontario.  Virginia Beach, March 20 through 22.  Tampa, April 11 and 12.  And then Caroline's here in New York, April 24 through 27.  Where are you in Tampa?  Why are you flexing?  I'm showing Bobby my new tattoo.  But no one cares.  Hold on, I'll finish.  And you can get my Jim Norton.  That's okay.  You can get American Degenerate on jimnorton.com.  It's available for download for five bucks.  That was great. 
[02:03:30]  Just meet him live.  That was a great special, by the way.  Thank you.  Really funny.  Yes.  Yeah, it was great.  It was like a plane, like in England, I couldn't get it, or Australia.  It's like, just go get it.  No, you can.  Yeah.  You know what?  Oh, forget it.  Yeah.  What were you going to say?  I'm just, because we weren't in or any calls after the Patrice benefit, but everybody killed.  It was one of the most fun nights.  Just everybody, the audience was fucking great.  It was just fucking unbelievable.  The host held it together perfectly. 
[02:04:00]  Everything went smoothly.  You did a great job.  Bobby fucking destroyed.  It's just everybody.  Yeah.  You know, Bonnie fucking, you know.  Stop naming people after you said everybody.  We know what that means.  How do you go from, we got to go, what's your probs?  I don't know.  To fucking, to your fucking, I'm saying nice things about everybody.  I don't even want you to.  I want you to fucking go to the break so we can get fucking, there's genius in here.  I want to learn about planets.  Yeah, I know, but Goss is doing his fucking, his summation of the fucking six months ago. 
[02:04:30]  Fucking boring asshole.  Shut up.  The gentlemen are off to drop a deuce.  Stay tuned for their progress.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, busy day.  We got Bob Kelly in the studio.  Rich Voss and Neil deGrasse Tyson is making his way into the studio in a minute or two here.  What number mic you got there, Rich?  Seven still?  There he is. 
[02:05:00]  Hello, sir.  Hey, Neil.  How are you?  Hey, are you familiar with our song lyric Sunday yet?  Yeah.  Is anybody?  Oh, God, we hate it.  We already made fun of it.  We made fun of that last week.  Oh, you did?  Terrible.  I just told Neil off mic how great the new show Cosmos is.  I just want to make sure I say it on air as well.  I saw the first episode last night and I loved it.  Yeah, just trying to keep the universe real.  Right.  What team did you play for?  Team Cosmos. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  I haven't seen it, but Obie was writing about it this morning.  And it's like you're kind of picking up Carl with the show Carl Sagan started and redoing it or just doing it?  Yeah, if you're old enough to remember that.  Yeah, unfortunately, yeah.  Well, a couple things.  I mean, they're putting a lot of money behind this show because the animation.  It's a full-up network production and we took full advantage of that.  It's not just because there's resources or money there, but we actually had access to visualization talent. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  That previously had only given those energies to full-blown blockbusters.  They built you a spaceship, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  He's in a spaceship.  Well, the ship of the imagination.  Ship of the imagination.  Ship of the imagination.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I like that.  In the original, you needed a place to pivot back and forth through space and time.  Right.  Some place to go so that the camera can go to the next place.  Right.  It had some mixed reviews because it was a little weird and wise in the air. 
[02:06:30]  No, I like it.  But in the new one, it's been re-envisioned.  Okay.  And I thought I was biased initially, but I'm not.  The ship is badass.  It is.  I don't mean to tell you.  I'm just saying.  The special effects of this new show is great.  My cousin programmed the computers on the space shuttle.  Andy Post.  You know Andy Post?  I know the name.  He's a genius.  Yeah, okay.  He programmed.  Is that his name, though?  Do you think he's bragging about you somewhere?  My husband.  My husband.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that what you call them now? 
[02:07:00]  My family relations.  Yeah, really?  With a lot of inbreeding, you get cousins.  I've explained it.  I didn't know you met Carl Sagan.  Yeah.  Yeah, when I was 17 years old.  Wow.  I was applying to colleges, and he's a professor up at Cornell.  Cornell, and I didn't know that my application to Cornell was sent to him by the admissions  office.  And they said, what do you think of this guy?  He wrote me a letter.  You were that smart back then? 
[02:07:30]  No, I don't think they just did.  It's not a matter of smart or not smart.  I don't even know what that word means.  But I know that I love the universe.  Okay.  And my application was dripping.  Okay.  Sort of got his attention.  Yeah, I got his attention.  He sent me a letter, invited me up, and showed me around.  And reached behind his desk and pulled out one of his books and signed.  I still have that book.  Showed that on the first episode.  To Neil Tyson's Future Astronomer.  Wow.  So, yeah.  Bobby doesn't know what a book is.  Oh, boy.  No, your polite laughter says it all, my friend. 
[02:08:00]  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  Yes.  Can I just say something?  Books are sources of knowledge that don't require batteries.  Yeah.  Can we segue into something?  In between Rich's ears, let's talk about the dark matter.  Yeah.  The endless void.  He says he's a genius.  He says he's a genius.  He took an IQ.  You're on radio.  No one knows who he is, as you point to him.  No, they know.  The audience knows.  They know.  We're talking about a dummy.  They know.  He took an IQ test recently. 
[02:08:30]  He took an IQ test.  141.  141.  Nice.  141.  And then, yeah.  What I find about people who get high IQs, they have to tell other people.  Right.  And it's like, I think the coolest IQs are the ones that you don't know what it is, and  they just are.  I also had a 142.  And what?  On an online IQ test.  Stop it.  By yourself in a kitchen with a pencil.  What were their Kardashian questions?  Make fun of me.  Can't be down to build yourself up.  No, I'm not building my stuff up at all. 
[02:09:00]  Any 12-step program will tell you that that's what you're doing.  But you just did that to Bobby.  What?  With the book thing.  No, I was being real.  Oh, I see.  You weren't making a joke.  I'm not making a joke.  I'm not.  This is a real.  I do want to hear about the universe.  Exactly.  I would like to be smart about that.  Thank you.  Well, the universe, it's all around us.  And one of the goals of Cosmos is to remind you of that thing.  That it's not just.  Some people don't like feeling insignificant, though.  Well, no, so that meant you started with an ego unjustifiably too large to begin with.  Is that it? 
[02:09:30]  Right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If you said, oh, that made me feel small.  Well, because you thought you were big compared to the universe.  So get real.  Notice how small we are in space and in time.  Yeah.  And then find other things to feel big about.  Like the very material of your body derives from stars.  We are stardust.  What?  Oh, my God.  This is where it gets crazy.  No, no, but so now you look up at night and you see the stars and say,  I'm a participant in the great unfolding of this cosmic story.  That's how you feel big.  You don't feel big by saying I'm bigger than the universe. 
[02:10:00]  Will you explain the ending of Prometheus for me?  No.  And will you spell it for me?  I have a quick Prometheus comment, if I may.  So they've made it clear how far away they are.  They're like, you know, 30 light years away near a star, okay, and around another star.  And there's a scene with Charlize Theron, I don't know if you remember this,  where there's this sexual tension between her and the captain of the ship.  And she says, pretendingly, like she's not interested,  I didn't come 50, no, no, what is it? 
[02:10:30]  I didn't come a billion miles into space to just, you know, make it with you.  And a billion miles is like to Saturn.  That's nothing.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's nothing.  That's nothing.  Would that be, let's see, 180 trillion light years?  180 trillion miles?  A billion miles?  No, a billion miles is a billion miles.  30 light years would be 180 trillion miles.  Yeah, about that, because one light year is six trillion miles, so the man's good.  Yeah, look at Jimmy.  Jimmy knows his light years. 
[02:11:00]  You're the only person that fucking critiqued that part of the movie.  Well, no, it was...  That's a billion.  What a bitch, don't know what she's talking about.  No, what people said was, we know you're a geek because you were not distracted,  otherwise distracted by her body.  I'm thinking, that's the wrong number she's saying here.  See, that's how you get geek street cred, all right?  It's about to be a sex scene.  I'm card carrying.  I got this.  I got this.  Yeah, I'd never have sex with her.  She's terrible at math.  I didn't say that now, but I...  So what are we getting from Cosmos, from the new one that you're hosting? 
[02:11:30]  We're just trying to...  I mean, it's a huge collaboration, and the lead writer is Ann Druyan, who is Carl Sagan's  widow, and co-author with Steve Soder, a colleague of mine, of the original series.  And so they're both...  So that means we have the genetic link to the original, so we know how to turn the knobs  and tweak the themes.  And so what we're trying to do is remind you that it's okay to be stupefied by the universe  to feel a sense of awe and wonder. 
[02:12:00]  And this is something we...  We all had it as kids, but at some point it all got beaten out of us or distracted out  of us.  And I say this often, you know, your parents spent the first year of your lives teaching  you to walk and talk, and the rest of your life telling you to shut up and sit down.  And it's the walking and talking and exploring of the world that a scientist still has as  an adult.  And the whole point of the show is to sort of ignite that flame of curiosity.  You know, so plus, plus the 21st century, you're going to need some kind of science 
[02:12:30]  literacy to solve the problems that we have in energy and transportation and security and  health.  So don't come around me saying, no, I don't need science.  I got other...  It's like, of course you need science.  And cosmos is a way to get you to realize how much you want science.  You're an astrophysicist, right?  Astrophysicist.  And what, like, how much of that involves, like, theoretical physics?  Is it the same thing or is it...  It's half.  I mean, it's all a community of... 
[02:13:00]  You put forth a hypothesis.  We have testing.  We have computer modeling.  And what emerges, once you explain what is known and successfully predict stuff you  hadn't known before, what emerges is a successful theory.  So the theory of gravity, quantum theory, evolutionary theory, these are the successful  understandings of how the natural world works.  And these are the highest fruits of science.  Wow.  You lost me at hello.  Do you think a lot of girl groupies?  A lot of scientist groupies?  Okay. 
[02:13:30]  So you asked me if they're girl groupies.  My assessment of this is that no one is immune...  No one of any gender is immune from being a science groupie.  And so I think my highest compliment I ever got was...  I got this in my Twitter stream.  The guy said, I'm as straight as the next guy, but if Neil Tyson showed up at my door  with a bottle of champagne and a Barry White CD, I'm letting him in.  So my point is, there are people who never before were stimulated intellectually, but they don't 
[02:14:00]  know how to react.  And whenever you're stimulated in other walks of life, you feel it's sensual.  So I'm finding that people are sensually stimulated by the intellectual enlightenment that the universe  brings to them.  And I say, whatever works, we'll do it.  Do you miss being on the love boat?  That wasn't me.  No, no. 
[02:14:30]  We actually just interviewed him recently.  That's why I said it.  I remember that interview.  Don't lie, Bob.  I thought you guys would laugh a little more.  You guys are all uptight because he knows how to make a laser.  We get very few bonafide geniuses.  Yeah, we love talking to guys like Neil.  We know that.  What are some of the subjects you're going to tackle with Cosmos?  Well, so the first episode, as you may remember, because you saw a preview of it, we had  to sort of lay the foundation.  I like the big calendar.  The calendar.  You got to walk on one of those big calendars.  The calendar the size of a football field. 
[02:15:00]  Yes.  And it's a year-at-a-glance calendar.  So it's got all 12 months there.  And you lay the history of the universe onto that calendar.  Oh, man.  So you get to say things like, well, when was the Big Bang?  January 1st.  Okay?  Right.  Go back there.  And I check it.  I don sunglasses for that.  It's the only thing I don sunglasses for.  You got to put on sunglasses.  Let it be for the Big Bang.  And then you can ask, when did our galaxy form, the Milky Way?  That was March 15th.  And then you say, on that calendar, and you say, well, when did our solar system form?  We didn't form when our galaxy formed. 
[02:15:30]  We are, after subsequent generations of stars, have forged these heavy elements that make the  physical chemistry that's in our bodies.  We needed to wait that time to have these ingredients enough to make planets and life  and people.  So that happened August 31st.  Wow.  And you keep going.  And then each day is about 40 million years.  So you can ask, when did the dinosaurs go extinct?  You go to the museums, you see the bones.  You say, boy, that was forever ago on a cosmic calendar.  It was a day and a half ago.  You still want to laugh. 
[02:16:00]  It was a day and a half ago.  A day and a half ago.  It was like midday December 30th.  That's right.  And so it puts it all.  Now you ask, well, when were we?  Right.  Now you, okay.  So all of recorded human history takes place in the last 15 seconds of the cosmic calendar.  Last 15 seconds?  Yes.  Based on one year being the entire history since the Big Bang.  Correct.  And now we are merely 15 seconds.  The entire record of any knowledge of who was a human being. 
[02:16:30]  So when people started taking notes, who were the kings, queens, dynasties, and all the  like, that was in the last, the fact to be precise, 14 seconds.  Can I see this off in my telescope I got with Marlboro Miles?  You got a telescope.  Actually, it's a special edition Cosmos telescope, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Special edition.  So, by Celestron.  Could you talk, it was in the first episode, about the planets that are in pitch darkness?  Oh, yeah.  So we learned. 
[02:17:00]  That's one thing I learned for the first time.  Like, what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the rogue planets.  Yeah, vagabond planets wandering the solar system.  Like, what's that ship that, you know, the ghost ships in the night.  I actually tried to, pardon me, I tried to actually give him a real scientific answer.  You should just put your elbow into my teeth.  No, no.  Because he said, what was that?  I'm going to go to the Voyager, scientist genius.  No, we got Voyager in there, too.  The farthest piece of hardware ever sent.  Yeah.  And on the side of it is a wreck.  I'll get back to the rogue planets in a minute, but since you brought up Voyager, Voyager 
[02:17:30]  was launched in the 70s, and it did a tour of the planets doing sort of a multi-planet  like pool shot, pool cue shot, where you do a slingshot around one planet, gives you  some extra energy, aim it in the right direction upon doing so, and if you plan this out right,  you can visit multiple planets with the same amount of energy, with the same launch energy.  Yeah, yeah, no.  That's crazy.  It's like Newton's laws of physics.  Have you ever been in space? 
[02:18:00]  Never, never.  Do you want to?  Only if you're going to send me somewhere.  I don't, you know, don't just send me in an orbit, boldly going where hundreds have  gone before, and, and, and, wait, wait, and, and, you know the dude, uh, Felix Baumgarten.  Baumgarten, yeah.  Don't get me started.  Edge of space jump.  That's cool.  Don't get me wrong.  Let the man be the edge of space jump.  But let me explain what he did, all right?  If you shrink Earth to the size of a schoolroom globe, so you get a sense of how high up he  was, ask, how high above a schoolroom globe did he jump? 
[02:18:30]  One millimeter above the surface.  One millimeter.  One millimeter above the surface.  And so, but no one from Red Bull is telling you that.  Right.  Where would space be?  And if that was the globe, where would actually, like, space be again?  Well, so space by that definition is kind of arbitrary.  What they're saying for, we have a functional definition of space.  It is the high enough altitude where the atmosphere is not glowing blue so that there's so little  air above you, you can see stars in the daytime sky. 
[02:19:00]  That's the reason why you can't see stars.  It's not because the sun is so bright.  It's because you have air there scattering sunlight.  The blue, blue out of the spectrum of sunlight.  It's scattering that.  That's why you have a blue sky.  You go up high enough, the sky gets thinner and thinner and thinner.  And then you have the universe in broad daylight.  That, for us, is about 60 miles up.  Okay?  So, if you go about 60 miles and up, we call that space.  But I don't like that as a definition of space.  Because if our atmosphere was thinner, then 30 miles up would be space. 
[02:19:30]  Or even thinner, 10 miles up.  If we had no atmosphere at all, what, would just be standing here on Earth be space?  In space, right.  Right, right.  So, when I think of space, I think of orbit.  Now you're talking space.  Now, how high before he would have, like, how high would he have had to go if he just jumped out and all of a sudden he's floating?  How much higher?  No, no, no.  So, that's the point.  You don't float unless you are in orbit.  And orbit is the coolest thing that Isaac Newton figured out.  So, here's what I, this will take me a minute.  Don't worry about me.  I'm already feeling dumb.  No, no, you got a minute.  I'm right behind you. 
[02:20:00]  So, all right.  If you're in an elevator and I cut the cable, the elevator, and you're standing on a scale.  And you weigh, what are you, 150 pounds?  About 149.5 since the dieting.  So, you're squeezing a spring and a scale, and it reads 150 pounds, right, in an elevator.  Now, I cut the cable.  The elevator drops.  The scale drops.  You drop.  You're all dropping at exactly the same rate.  The scale no longer reads 150 pounds.  It reads zero. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  Everything in that elevator is weightless because you're in free fall towards Earth.  Right.  Until you hit the bottom, and then you're dead.  All right.  Unless there's springs and things.  But, so, if you are in orbit, you are going sideways while you are falling towards Earth.  You just happen to have sideways motion.  And so, you are going so fast sideways that for every 10 feet you fall, Earth curves away from you by 10 feet.  Right.  You go 30 feet down, Earth has curved 30 feet. 
[02:21:00]  This is the exact speed you have to have.  You're constantly falling around.  You're constantly falling towards a round object.  Yeah.  So, that's why astronauts are weightless.  I've got to go.  Not because they've left the Earth and are floating randomly in space.  They are weightless because they are falling towards Earth.  So, Felix Baumgartner was never weightless until he actually jumped.  Well, you jump, you're in free fall.  Right.  You're weightless while you jump.  When the astronauts, and I asked the physicists this week, what...  You just talk to physicists. 
[02:21:30]  That's cool.  Yeah.  You have access.  How many people...  We've gotten hookers.  Exactly.  It's not everybody who has access.  How do we get to say...  We're the second one this week.  Yes.  Brian Green came in.  Brian, he's a good friend.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  He's cool.  But the astronauts, when they're in space, we always think, like, oh, my God, they're not  dealing with any gravity.  And I know that they're falling.  But if they were to, like, say, stop falling, what percentage of Earth's gravity would they  feel at that height?  Well, so, if you just stop their sideways motion... 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  ...then they would fall straight down instead of sideways down.  And they would still be weightless until they encountered the atmosphere.  And then the atmosphere would slow them down, and they'd start taking on weight for having  done so.  So what percentage of the Earth's gravity isn't at that height, like, would you say?  Oh, it's slightly less.  Hardly no...  You'd be, like...  Negligible.  No, no, less than a pound.  Yeah.  Less than a pound.  So it's about...  Their experience is about 95% of the gravity we are if they weren't falling.  If they were floating there in a hot air balloon, you would feel the weight at that altitude. 
[02:22:30]  And they would...  If you're 150, you'd be, like, 148 and a half pounds, maybe.  149 pounds.  That's why, unless you're in orbit, the Earth would like to have you back.  Yeah, yeah.  I like that.  And another thing, if you go up, if you just drop down to Earth, you're not going to burn  up.  You know why you burn up coming back?  It's the speed.  Because you were going 18,000 miles an hour sideways.  All right?  And we've got to get rid of that energy somehow.  And so, fortunately, we have the atmosphere.  You say, oh, they need the heat shields, otherwise they'll burn up. 
[02:23:00]  They like the heat shields, because they don't have to bring fuel to slow down.  They're basically aero-breaking.  It is a feature, not a problem, of returning from space.  You've just got to make sure you design it so that you don't burn up.  Amazing.  And so, you need those heat shields to dissipate the 18,000 miles an hour sideways energy.  And if you're just standing up there in space and I drop you, you'll gain speed, but then  you'll start feeling the atmosphere and you'll start to slow down. 
[02:23:30]  Right.  So, you can just drop out of, if the space shuttle turned backwards, the former space  shuttle, turned backwards, fired its rockets so that it lost the energy, the speed, and  it was just like zero, it could just fall, it would drop out and land like an airplane  and you wouldn't need the heat shields.  But it wouldn't be economical.  It wouldn't be economical.  You'd need as much fuel to slow down as they needed to get there in the first place.  Uh-huh.  Wow, yeah.  I never realized that. 
[02:24:00]  I always thought if you kept going up.  No such thing as a free lunch.  I always thought if you kept going up, you'd hit that heat, but I guess not.  Okay.  That's perfect.  It's just friction with air molecules.  Talk about the rogue planets.  He hasn't freaked me out of one-track mind.  Well, you said you'd go back.  It was such a creepy concept.  We learned recently, I mean, the last 15 years or so, when we started creating models  of planets, of the formation of star systems, you realize, okay, here we are with eight  planets and some debris, Pluto included. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  Get over it here.  That's messed up.  Yeah.  I know.  For some people, it's messed up.  It's messed up.  If you've taken the whole picture, it's actually pretty cool.  Yeah, yeah.  So Pluto is the biggest member of a new swath of real estate known as the Kuiper Belt of  icy bodies in the outer solar system.  So Pluto's happier there.  I'm pretty sure.  So if you do this, you say, well, we have these many planets, and did we form that way?  You put it on the computer, take a mass of a gas cloud, collapse it, form planets within 
[02:25:00]  it, and you end up with three or four times as many planets as what ultimately give you  stable orbits later.  And so our solar system probably started with like 30 planets, 20 to 30 planets.  Where did they go?  They get flung out into space because their trajectories moving around the sun and near  other planets is not stable.  It's just not stable.  And so some will collide with Jupiter.  Some get slammed back into the sun.  Others are cast asunder.  And it's those that are cast into interstellar space that constitute the vagabond planets, 
[02:25:30]  and they may outnumber the planets that have homes.  So these are basically homeless planets.  And some of them might still have heat.  Earth still has heat.  That's why we have volcanoes.  That heat doesn't come from the sun.  That comes from leftover heat from our formation.  Plus there's some radioactive decay of elements in our crust pumping heat in.  So that doesn't need the sun.  And we always talk about the Goldilocks zone.  It has the right temperature for liquid water so you have life because you need heat for that.  If you have a planet floating in space and it still has this leftover heat, you don't need the sun. 
[02:26:00]  It'll be frozen on its surface, but go down deep.  Maybe there's life thriving deep beneath the frozen surface.  There is life on other planets.  There could very well likely be, given what we know about life and its ingredients.  Do you think we'll discover it in our lifetime?  I'd like to think so.  Possibly on Mars or one of Jupiter's moons, Europa.  Europa is cool.  It's outside of the Goldilocks zone because Jupiter is too far away. 
[02:26:30]  But Jupiter is pumping heat inside of it with the stress of its gravity.  And when you pump heat inside, you melt the ice.  And we're pretty sure Europa has an ocean of liquid water that's been liquid for billions of years.  So as I tell people often, I want to go ice fishing on Europa.  There's a movie called The Europa Report where they actually took a clip of me talking about Europa, put it in there.  Oh, really?  It was like an actual live clip about the discovery of life on Europa.  I think I saw that one.  Weren't they sending a probe down to go through the ice? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I did see that one.  Yeah, and it's water.  So every place on Earth you have liquid water, you have life.  Including the Dead Sea.  You know why they call it the Dead Sea?  Because they didn't have microscopes.  Okay?  So just be careful how you name stuff.  Because typically you name it in ways derived from the limitations of your physiology.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought they were salty.  I thought there was no salt in it.  Yeah, so there's no macroscopic fishes and things.  So people thought that nothing was alive. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they just didn't.  Microscope hadn't been invented yet.  Right.  So if they get below the surface, do you think they're going to find something that's microbiotic or something?  Yeah, yeah.  If you go to Europa.  So we ask them what are the chances we might find life.  If I were to sort of rank the places, I'd say maybe a subsurface Mars.  There could be some places kept liquid, some aquifers.  That'd be nice to see.  And that's nearby compared with Europa.  Europa, that's a long trip to take.  How far is that?  Well, Jupiter, it's five times the Earth-Sun distance. 
[02:28:00]  So, yeah, I'd give it a ten-year.  That one's like a genius.  As a married guy, your wife has to be brilliant to keep up with you.  I mean, you're not going to talk like this and she's going to talk about the housewives.  Well, she has a Ph.D. in mathematical physics.  Yeah, she's got to be, you can't, like, you can't.  And we met in graduate school.  Yeah, she's got to be brilliant because when you said, when we all talk about the cauliflower or whatever, 
[02:28:30]  none of us talk about the cauliflower.  First of all, no one knows what cauliflower is.  Oh, my God.  When he's talking about.  If you want to reenact this scene that you're hearing right now at home,  just start to listen to an ant talking to you.  If an ant is talking to you, it's the same thing.  That's what Neil has to deal with today.  That's what Neil is dealing with right now.  Because if a bug was in your kitchen and started making noises,  and you had to try to understand what the bug was saying.  To communicate with the worm.  You've got to be brilliant.  But Neil should be sitting on a bank and talking to Rich and telling Rich, 
[02:29:00]  just go ahead, look out across the water, and Rich should be talking about tending the rabbits.  Right.  They try to tear you down.  You know what's more important than knowledge?  Wonder.  Yeah.  I wonder why they're still on the air.  No, but he's a pretty hip scientist, though, as scientists go.  Yeah, he makes it cool.  Yeah, you're actually kind of hip and cool.  Like, if I met you, I wouldn't know you were a fucking genius.  You just didn't.  No, I know.  Let me just say that I, first, I think I got good material. 
[02:29:30]  The universe gives you good material.  But, A, B, I'm not making, the universe, I'm just revealing the universe as I feel it and as I see it.  Right.  So, I'm not, so to say that I make it fun, no, it is fun.  When I think about falling into a black hole, that's some fun stuff right there.  Okay?  How it spaghettifies you as you get extruded through the narrowing fabric of space-time.  All right?  That's just inherently awesome to think about. 
[02:30:00]  How many miles do you think it is from, like, the event horizon into the actual hole?  Like, how far do you think?  Well, the event horizon technically is what we think of as the hole.  Because you cross over the event horizon, you ain't coming back out.  And light doesn't come out, black hole.  Period.  Wow.  So, once you're in, that's it.  And you go all the way down to the singularity as, like I said, you're funneling, the fabric of space and time gets narrower.  Plus, there's something called the tidal force, the thing that makes tides on Earth between the Earth and the Moon and the Sun and the Earth. 
[02:30:30]  But there's also a tidal force for black holes.  As you fall towards a black hole, if you go in a feet-first dive, the gravity, the change in gravity becomes so severe that your feet start getting pulled towards the center of the black hole faster than your head does.  And that's okay initially because you feel like you're stretching, right?  That's just a good stretch.  But then it becomes unrelenting.  And then the force, at one point, the force will exceed the intermolecular forces of your tissue of your body.  And then you will snap into two pieces, likely at the base of your spine. 
[02:31:00]  Then the other two pieces will snap into two pieces.  Then they become four.  And then eight.  And then 16.  And you will bifurcate as you descend down to this cosmic abyss.  And like I said, that's not even the worst part because now you're being funneled down to something that's really narrow.  And so there you are being stretched head to toe and then squeezed shoulder to shoulder.  And this is the extruding that goes on as you descend to a black hole. 
[02:31:30]  And that's why we call it spaghettification.  For sure.  I really hate you to torture people like that.  If they had it, they so surely would have done it.  What's your conclusion with the Bermuda Triangle?  Oh, my God.  I really hate you to ask the Bermuda Triangle.  I got a conclusion of his conclusion.  I'm crazy.  Guys, I'm still in Barry's.  I need to go.  I'm in Barry's.  I want to go because I think this might be contagious.  Bermuda Triangle.  Hold on.  Elmer Fudd had a question. 
[02:32:00]  Elmer Fudd.  Have you seen a rabbit?  I swear we're smart.  I swear we're smart.  No, no.  I have a good answer for you.  No, thank you.  That's a good question.  Don't let them.  I slipped on the word.  We're together here.  I want to hear your conclusion.  You're right at my side.  Pay no mind to the.  I don't listen.  There's nothing to pay.  Listen.  Do you donate your time at a community college?  Why are you being so nice to him?  So, here's an interesting fact. 
[02:32:30]  The Bermuda Triangle.  What was it?  Bermuda, Miami, and somewhere in the Bahamas.  Some large, yeah, some triangle of Atlantic Ocean where there were ships disappearing and  planes disappearing and people were wondering whether there was something mystical, magical  going on there.  And so, okay, if you're losing planes, you want to know why.  All right?  Is it magic or is it not?  And so, you do the analysis and what you find out is that that triangle had such a high, 
[02:33:00]  it was such a highly traversed shipping lane that if you were to find for planes and for  ships, that the normal rate that planes crash or that ships sink for the whole world was  also happening there.  It's just that there were more of them.  That's all that is?  That's all it is.  And so, if you ran through the numbers, it was no more dangerous than any other place  in the world.  It's just that the probability was higher.  The total traffic was higher, of course. 
[02:33:30]  More accidents are going to happen where there's more traffic on the road.  Where there's more traffic.  And here's another interesting point.  No one ever talks about missing trains.  Well, if you crash in the freaking ocean, you sink to the bottom, all right?  To the bottom of an ocean that's miles deep.  Right.  All right?  And so, yeah, for our intents and purposes, you've disappeared.  If you could drain the Atlantic, whoa.  You'd see a lot of planes. 
[02:34:00]  All the biology would have been eaten.  All the human flesh would have been eaten.  But the cargo?  Oh, my gosh.  In fact, the thing you really want to drain is the Mediterranean.  Oh, right.  Because suckers have been sailing that thing since, you know, for thousands of years.  Probably some quite a bit of wealth down there.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  From Caesar's time and all the rest of that.  Yeah.  So.  The salad guy.  So how do you, what do you mean, missing trains?  No, no, so.  Because I mean, Penn Station. 
[02:34:30]  No, no, so you can miss, you can, so.  They're missing planes.  Missing ships.  It's not fair.  That wasn't a joke.  Because when they're gone, they sink to the bottom of the ocean and you don't see them.  Right.  Yes.  I get that.  No one ever reports a missing train.  Because the train is on ground.  Because it's not magical is what he's saying.  And you can stare at it.  It's not just going to go missing.  It's not going to disappear.  It's not going to disappear.  Neil deGrasse.  Salad dressing.  Neil deGrasse Tyson in studio.  Cosmos is on.  What channel is it on?  I just got a copy of this.  Yo, so can I tell you, can I just, okay, so first it's on Fox. 
[02:35:00]  Okay.  Fox primetime, Sunday night, 9 o'clock.  Wow.  And then Fox said, Fox said, we like this show so much that we want to, there's a new word  for me, roadblock the show.  Do you ever know the phrase roadblock?  Roadblock.  That's when he gets out of his car.  Oh.  And then it turns back strong.  I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when.  But he'll bomb again.  If the network roadblocked the show, they take the rest of their properties, their cable  properties, and simultaneously air it on those smart as well. 
[02:35:30]  So it's going to appear on FX, which is a Fox property.  FXX.  Fox owns three quarters of National Geographic television, so that's in their family as well.  It's on Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild.  It's on Fox Sports 1.  Really?  Fox Sports 2.  Sports.  And so, and then it will repeat on National Geographic in the days to come.  And it's in a, I sound like a commercial here, but that's, you got to hear this.  There's 181 countries and 45 languages.  It will air within days of the American premiere. 
[02:36:00]  Wow.  And so, Fox has made a huge investment in this, in the distribution, and I think the  product will live up to the expectations.  I saw it.  It's strong.  It looks great.  You know what, I got a great idea.  Maybe you bring somebody on like me to teach me as you're going through this stuff.  Exactly.  Like this, I brought my friend who I'm going to call Dumb Talking Turtle.  No, so, so the show is for people who, it's, we already got the geeks.  I know we got the geeks.  Yeah.  And it's for people who, who never knew they could or would like science, but it's also 
[02:36:30]  for people who are pretty sure they don't like science.  Right.  Or they can't relate to it.  It's, it's, it's for anyone really with a beating heart.  The show's going to do great.  You have a great way of explaining things.  Well, it was really easy to follow and it was fun to watch because of the animation and  the special effects and stuff.  I hope he brought up the fact that, what is it, what did you say he does very well?  Oh, I, I, you walk out of, out of frame nicely.  You make a dramatic point and then you continue walking.  A dramatic point and then walk off.  And then we're left with the star. 
[02:37:00]  We'll let the universe feel the talking.  I mean, I could spend the whole time lecturing you, but we have awesome visual effects.  What you should have done is actually stood, like, whenever the camera went to the star,  you should have stood in front of it and just kind of walked the room.  Yeah, here I am.  You know, it's like, no, no.  So, so what happened was the original script was wordier than what ultimately came to pass.  I was there describing how hot the sun was.  Right.  And because we, as we dip into the sun and we even visit a black hole.  But then when you realize the visuals were so stunning and so compelling, what the hell am I 
[02:37:30]  talking about?  Yeah.  You feel the heat of the sun.  You know that's a black hole.  Right.  So shut up, Neil.  You know, this is what, so, so we, we, we trimmed just the total number of words.  And I'm there really as a, to guide the voyage, not to be the voyage.  Could you talk about the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs?  That was creepy on the first episode.  I didn't know this either.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know about the asteroid, obviously, but.  But it's the size, a little bit bigger than the size of Mount Everest and it slammed into  Earth, you know, 65, 66 million years ago. 
[02:38:00]  And our mammal ancestors were running underfoot trying to avoid being hors d'oeuvres for T-Rex.  And there we would have stayed had this asteroid not struck.  No, but the reason.  So it's a taker away and bringer of life because it renders that the dinosaurs extinct as well  as 70% of all species of life on Earth.  And then the, the, the, the, the, uh, the early mammals, it opened up an ecological niche  so they can evolve to something more ambitious than tree shrews. 
[02:38:30]  But the actual asteroid, didn't you say something, how it bounced off another asteroid?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, so there's a lot of dynamics.  There's a part of it now.  There's a shooting gallery out there.  And you have these asteroids, big ones, medium ones, small ones.  And though some come a little near one versus another, they each have gravity.  If you come a little close to me, I'm going to nudge you with my,  I don't have to touch you to nudge you because there's this force at a distance called gravity.  And stunning that it exists across the vacuum of space. 
[02:39:00]  Think about that.  This troubled Isaac Newton.  How could one thing affect another?  And there's nothing between them.  What's going on?  There's no, there's no rope.  There's no tether.  There's no hook.  How did, so it was a huge mystery to him until I, until Einstein basically figured this out and said the gravity is not really a force.  It is the curvature of the fabric of space and time.  If you, if you know NASCAR, people say, oh, but NASCAR drivers always turn left, right?  They don't know how to turn right because that's the direction of the track. 
[02:39:30]  However, the tracks are banked.  So if you drive on a NASCAR track and you drive at the speed for which the bank is angled, you never have to turn the wheel.  Right.  You just stay driving forward and the track turns you all by itself.  So too is the curvature in the fabric of space and time.  It will curve you even though you think you're going in a straight line.  The car thinks it's going in a straight line because you didn't turn the steering wheel. 
[02:40:00]  So the only time they turn the steering wheel is to maneuver among the cars.  If they're going the right speed, they're not actually turning left to complete the circle.  So you have a planet with mass that affects space.  Yeah, the fabric of space.  The fabric of space.  So in essence, the force of gravity isn't really a force.  You're almost going down a hill.  You're surfing a hill.  A slope.  To the mass.  Brilliant.  He's got it.  He's got it.  I'm glad I said that earlier.  So brilliant.  Thank you for clarifying.  You said it in fewer words than I did. 
[02:40:30]  So what happens is you have an asteroid minding its own business that might not have otherwise been on a collision course with Earth.  And then another asteroid comes by it and it gets nudged.  It doesn't nudge by the force of gravity into a trajectory that 65 million years ago collided with Earth.  And they think this is the extreme contingency of life on Earth.  And they think this is what happened.  Where did it glide?  Do they know where it is?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we found the spot.  And by the way, it was the Yucatan Peninsula.  The Yucatan Peninsula, what is now Mexico. 
[02:41:00]  Cocoa, really?  You know what's cool?  I've got to tell you this.  I described this to a whole room of people.  And I tried to be funny.  And I said, this asteroid struck at the Yucatan Peninsula of what is now Mexico.  And I said, although that's not what the dinosaurs called it back then.  I thought I was being cute, right?  Oh, boy.  And someone in the front row said, no, they called it Mexico.  Wow. 
[02:41:30]  He's cracking himself up.  No, it was good.  I thought that was good.  The dinosaurs, like, spoke Spanish and pronounced it right.  It doesn't seem odd.  So right there, what they found, and by the way, this was with the help of oil drillers,  people who look for anomalies in the crust of the earth to see where there might be repositories of oil.  In so doing, they found a ridgeline that was, like, 150 miles in circumference.  And this ridgeline, they tracked it around, and it completed an entire circle. 
[02:42:00]  And you go down there and date the rocks 65 million years ago.  So we say, yes, there's the smoking gun, the crater left over from the asteroid that struck.  Is there any of the original asteroid in there, like any pieces of it, teeny pieces?  No.  I mean, there may be, but it's in the Gulf.  And so, plus, most of the asteroid would be vaporized upon impact with the earth.  You'd get maybe, you know, a few percent of the total mass that just happened to fall off. 
[02:42:30]  But we're talking about 65 million years ago, and it's not...  So my point is, it's pure luck we're here, because that asteroid just had a little bump or whatever.  Correct.  And if...  So what would happen is, if the asteroid didn't hit, dinosaurs would surely still be here.  To this day.  And we wouldn't.  Oh, yeah.  Because they were around...  You want to...  Mine...  Mine...  You could say the F word.  No.  Well, he doesn't want to, but it was fun watching him realize what he backed himself into. 
[02:43:00]  No, that was a moment.  There's been a couple times where I thought, shit, it was going to come on.  Motherfucker was going to come on.  No, no, no, no.  Okay, you tell me whether this earns it, okay?  Yeah.  So, if you look at the tenure that dinosaurs enjoyed on earth, they were around for 200 million  years before the asteroid struck.  Wow.  And it's only been 65 million years since.  Wow.  So, given that fact, there is no reason to presume that they wouldn't still be here. 
[02:43:30]  They wouldn't be here.  They were just unlucky.  They didn't have a space program to deflect the asteroid.  So, it is likely that if the asteroid did not strike, they would still be here and we  wouldn't.  Now, maybe would they have technology, would they be in this booth doing a radio show?  And I'd have more listeners.  They would say something like, aren't we lucky that that asteroid didn't strike?  Well, wait, you know when... 
[02:44:00]  Whereas you're saying, aren't we lucky that it did?  Sure, of course.  Hey, we only have a couple minutes, but someone wants you to talk about the discovery of water...  Wait, wait.  No, no, no.  The alien thing.  Okay, yeah.  Can you touch on the theory that aliens are at the bottom of the ocean?  I...  I'm...  Is that one of your things?  I hadn't heard that one.  Oh, no.  I wasn't sure if that was a lot of these guys.  What is true is that there are surely species of fishes thriving at the bottom of the ocean  that are uncatalogued and unknown to biologists. 
[02:44:30]  So, we know so much more about our solar system than the oceanographer knows about the bottom  of the ocean.  In fact, it's more dangerous to visit the bottom of the ocean than it is to visit space.  The pressure difference between your vessel and space is one atmosphere.  The pressure difference between your vessel and the bottom of the ocean is 30 atmospheres, 50 atm...  You go down, you...  Your vessel...  You're ready to die.  Right.  Be ready to die.  Going down, like, to the Marianas Trench off of the Philippines, the deepest part of Earth's crust. 
[02:45:00]  So...  How deep?  It's 30,000 feet down.  It's as far deep into our crust as Mount Everest is high.  Oof.  What is the...  Like, Jupiter's gravity is so intense.  Like, what's the difference between Jupiter's gravity and that?  Okay.  Well, the problem is you can't just stand on Jupiter and pull out your scale and weigh yourself  because it's gaseous.  And plus, Jupiter's large, so you're actually far away from the source of gravity at the...  I mean, how you calculate the gravity. 
[02:45:30]  So, if you're 150 pounds, I forgot the number.  You're not as heavy as you think you would have been.  Like, you might be 400 pounds or something.  You're not going to be, like, thousands and thousands of pounds.  And Jupiter and Saturn are actually very low density because they're made of mostly gas.  Saturn has such low density, it's less dense than water.  So, in fact, Saturn could float if you had a bathtub big enough.  And when I was a kid, I said, I don't want the rubber ducky, I want a rubber Saturn so  that it could float.  And be accurate.  An accurate depiction.  Exactly. 
[02:46:00]  You didn't say that as a kid.  I swear to you I said that as a kid.  Did you go to a regular school?  Yeah.  PS.  All my schools had a PS in front of it.  Are you from New York?  Born and raised in New York City in the Bronx.  Went to PS 36 in the East Bronx for, like, kindergarten.  You still live here?  Yeah.  Yeah, I live in Manhattan now.  And then went to PS 81.  You were, like, 12 years old in college, right?  No, no.  I went to junior high school, 141, and then to the Bronx High School of Science.  What a great statement for the New York City school system.  Yeah.  Well, I think that Bronx Science is a public school.  And one of our proudest points is that Bronx Science counts eight Nobel laureates among its graduates. 
[02:46:30]  And seven Jews, my people.  Big, big Nobel.  All right, then.  He's got to go for real.  No, he's actually right.  A fourth of all Nobel Prizes given in the sciences have gone to Jews.  And what about medicine?  Do you want to go there, too?  That was great.  No, medicine, I'm counting that in the sciences.  Oh, you are?  Exactly.  Dunny.  Human physiology and medicine is a category of the Nobel Prizes.  Calm down.  He always blows it.  I know.  Just when you had him on your side, you had to ruin it with your pro-Semitism. 
[02:47:00]  Pro-Semitism.  That's a great phrase.  What I would try to caution people is the more you cite the achievements of others with whom you associate,  the less you're admitting that you have less to talk about for yourself.  Yep.  Oh.  Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing.  He's basically killing parades.  What you're trying to do is bask in the luminosity of others with whom you associate, and so that some of that luminosity would be shed upon you.  And what I would encourage you... 
[02:47:30]  At least you went from scientist to doctor to therapist.  Luminosity.  Now I really feel stupid.  What I would encourage people, rather than say, oh, these are my people or my country, I would encourage people to be the luminosity yourself.  And believe me...  Well, they are when other people talk about...  And I slightly violate it, because I said the Bronx Sunniers had eight Nobel laureates.  But to make a point, that that's as many Nobel laureates as the country of Spain. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  And so I want to make a point that it's not a given that at any time and place, your nation or your culture puts forth great achievers.  And it takes investments.  It takes nurturing.  And the Jewish community, you have that.  By the way, it's not the entire Jewish community.  No, I know.  It's subsets of the Jewish community that value learning and creative thinking.  So just remember, America may have had its day, and maybe we're fading now. 
[02:48:30]  And as much as you're saying, don't associate yourself with the Jews, believe me, the Jews agree with you.  They do not want Voss admitting that he's Jews.  Every time he talks, they're like, just shut up and convert.  They're saying, I'm like, Jehovah's Witness and Catholicism pamphlets.  Plus, he's fully tattooed.  You're not allowed to do that.  Well, first of all, they were free.  Of course they were.  In the Bible, it says, tattoos are okay if it's free.  Free mutilation of your body.  That's all about the tattoos. 
[02:49:00]  Because if you couldn't get into a cemetery for defacing your body, not one Jew would be in a cemetery because of facelifts, ear piercings.  That's defacing your body.  And what about the circumcision?  That's kind of defacing your body as well.  He doesn't like them.  Yeah, it's a little loophole right there, isn't it?  But I agree with what you're saying about not putting anybody on a pedestal.  Rich, we've got to let him go.  We've got to let him go.  No, I've been trying to do this for five minutes.  And you're agreeing with him.  I agree space is big.  What's that, Rich?  His big time is vast. 
[02:49:30]  There you go.  It's a great ending, and Dummy's going to ask nine more questions.  Neil is very busy, and he truly has to go.  They're panicking outside the studio.  I've been trying to cut him off for real.  Guys, thanks for that.  Great being on the show again.  Thanks for calling me.  Neil, I hope you should just give the plug real quick.  It's 9 o'clock on Fox on Sunday and a bunch of other channels.  And just go to Neil Tyson at Twitter, and he will have all the information.  I want to say it again.  That'd be at Neil Tyson on Twitter.  I want to say it again.  Put the at in front of Neil Tyson.  I saw the first episode. 
[02:50:00]  I'm in.  Big time.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  We're still talking about Neil deGrasse Tyson's appearance.  Bob Kelly has a very, very good observation. 
[02:50:30]  You want to bring it to the people?  Yeah.  Rich Voss is a fucking blithering, never-ending idiot that doesn't take a hint.  All right.  We're wrapping up.  He's got to go.  One more question.  I know.  Fucking let it go.  It's like you've never done radio.  We've been here.  When Ropey goes, all right, thanks for coming in.  Shut the fuck up.  First of all, let me tell you something, fucking idiot.  Sometimes you're not getting the same messages as I am.  People scream in our ear like, holy fuck, he's got to go.  He's got to go.  So I'm like trying to wrap it up. 
[02:51:00]  And then I sound like an idiot because now I'm interrupting people.  We all get when you go, all right.  When you say the word all right, after an hour of conversation with a guy, we all, everybody  in here except for fucking, fucking, bird chirping, fucking douche, front fingered, cock sucking,  fucking mush mouth, fucking sleeve douche bag.  And the only reason I say all right is because we're getting pressure in our ears.  I know.  And here's it too.  And then that's when fucking, he hasn't said a word in fucking a half hour. 
[02:51:30]  So let me, first of all, let me say this.  And two things.  Can you wear your headphones the right way?  I hate when he doesn't wear his head on you.  Let me say, let me say this.  He pops one way on top like he's a rapper or something.  And be honest, a lot of times when you're rapping a show, all of a sudden you'll keep  going or throwing something in.  So you get the vibe like, oh, but now we really, time and time again.  You're just anticlimactic.  It was this great interview.  There was a couple zings, a couple bombs.  I got some good lines. 
[02:52:00]  The golf boat thing didn't really go over with my racist friend.  We were all nervous.  No, we talked about that during the break.  It was a very good line, but we were very nervous.  Well, I get it.  It was perfect.  It was just great.  And he did this thing, and he talks great, and he tells us, and the thing, and then he  goes, all right, okay.  And then, so anyway.  Like, it never.  Could you explain the universe?  It's always a question that takes, like, it has to take 10 minutes.  It's not a quick yes or no question.  Here's the problem with Bobby.  Was it an apple that fell out of a tree? 
[02:52:30]  Is that how we go on it?  Here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  Isaac Newton.  Could you explain him?  Why was his hair, why was Einstein's hair so crazy?  Here's the problem.  Isaac invent the fig.  Here's the problem.  Here's the problem with Bobby.  And, and.  Bobby.  I'm going to play with Bobby on this one.  No, we're all saying this.  Don't just single me out, because I'm a little overweight, you fucking mean person.  That's nothing to do with, wait.  Here's the problem.  You had nine planet jokes.  Listen, I had one.  I said one planet joke.  Here's the problem.  Fucking roadblock.  Can I, that was very fun. 
[02:53:00]  Here's the problem.  Bobby is so dumb.  When the guy was talking, Bobby's eyes were just like, he's so dumb.  So now it's Bobby.  Finish the sentence.  Stupid.  You were staring.  You said twangle.  I didn't say twangle.  Twangle.  And you asked him what his fucking conclusion was.  You fucking shit dick.  Oh, I fucking dumb.  You're dumber.  You're so dumb, it makes me angry.  Like, I'm fucking mad at you.  Because you're dumb.  I want you to get help. 
[02:53:30]  Next year's Patrice benefit is to raise money for stupid.  We're taking all the money and the watch money that we fucking get from selling those.  And we're sending him to school.  Because then we all look at him.  I don't know.  Then we all get embarrassed.  It sounds uncomfortable.  Because he knows we're all friends.  What's your conclusion on the theory?  He fucking stinks.  What's your conclusion? 
[02:54:00]  What the fuck is this?  A board game with you kids?  You fucking mumpf.  I hate you.  I fucking love you richly.  You fucking make me violently angry with your stupid word choice.  He did come up with some good theories and answers on the Bermuda Triangle.  Yeah, but then you asked about the train.  The train.  You didn't even understand his concept.  What about the missing trains?  Where'd they go?  Oh, I thought he was going to come up.  I thought he was going to say that some trains were missing. 
[02:54:30]  No, that's the whole point.  He was making the point that you don't have trains disappearing.  So why would planes and ships disappear?  Or are they just sticking to the bottom of the ocean?  But all of a sudden you go, well, what about the trains?  He asked it after he explained it.  Yes.  It's not that he asked it when he was beginning.  He just fucking told you.  After the explanation.  I was daydreaming.  About what?  Oh, God.  About what?  And what was the fuck?  And what was the cauliflower thing?  I don't know. 
[02:55:00]  I still don't know.  He goes, well, we're all talking.  Was that a cooking joke?  I don't even know.  No, he said we're all sitting around talking to cauliflower theory.  Was it cauliflower?  No.  No, you said cauliflower.  I fucking hate him.  If we don't do something about this, we're going to lose a friend.  You understand that?  One of us is going to fucking kill him someday.  It violently fucking makes me mad.  Cauliflower conclusions.  This fucking dumb cauliflower. 
[02:55:30]  This cauliflower makes me angry.  When we're all talking something theory.  And I want to say.  Something theory?  Something theory.  Let me ask you about the something theory.  You know, it's Einstein something theory.  You guys can make jokes, but I can't.  It's the hypothesis of the cauliflower incident.  Was it cauliflower?  Maybe that wasn't the word.  Incident.  You said cauliflower.  None of us wanted to make fun of you.  We didn't want to call you stupid.  We were all quiet.  We just wanted to hear this genius talk. 
[02:56:00]  Ask some questions.  I asked them a couple.  And you fucking speak.  And you bury yourself.  With your stupid wrong words.  You dumb hand.  And first of all.  Explain the asparagus nebula.  Holy shit.  Then he just starts talking about cues with the guy.  Then he's got to bring up the juice.  That was all after the interview was done.  I get it.  But it's not like I sit here and just eat donuts and pizza.  So you can just make fun of me being fat the whole time. 
[02:56:30]  I make two jokes about it.  I sip coffee and I drink water.  So I don't give you ammunition.  But you just open your dumb mouth.  Fucking cauliflower experiments.  And then he's breaking about juice with the guy.  What the fuck?  He's a black guy.  He don't care.  Yeah, because we both, you know, we're too struggling.  He's not struggling at all.  No, he's just fine.  He's struggling to understand your question.  He is just fine.  The cauliflower incident. 
[02:57:00]  He should study your brain instead of the universe.  I would love to.  I'd just see Rich lean over to Bobby and stop laughing and whispering at the black hole thing.  Right, right.  I'd just see Rich like, it's a good joke here that I'm not saying.  Every time there was a fucking joke like that, he'd look at me wide-eyed.  I know.  Rich is like, well, yeah, when he said, you know, and slide into the black hole.  And Rich was like, black hole.  I got a good one.  I had a lot.  I held back.  I know.  I know.  That's the point it's now making. 
[02:57:30]  We all did.  Yeah, we all were holding back, except for me, a couple times.  I fucked up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that funny, man?  Fucking conclusion.  Yeah.  What's your conclusion?  Wait, people are coming up with other ones.  Oh, I love it.  You got to take this, Rich.  Tony in Cleveland.  Tony.  Hey, Rich.  Love you as a comedian.  Hate you as a freaking intelligent person.  I know where you got cauliflower or something.  He was talking about the aquifers on Mars.  No, but he said when we all.  Aquifer.  No, no, no. 
[02:58:00]  He said when we're all talking about something.  Goldilocks.  Goldilocks was in there, too.  Goldilocks and aquifers.  Yeah.  Oh, the Goldilocks theory or something.  Goldilocks theory?  No, he said we're all talking.  He said something like when we're all sitting around talking about.  God damn, I wish I knew what it was.  I wish.  Yeah, of course.  We wish you did, too.  We wish you listened.  Wow.  Absorbed.  Our pal Justin Stane has a great line.  I can't steal it.  What is it?  He goes, Bonnie, aliens are stealing trains.  Justin rules. 
[02:58:30]  Bonnie.  I only fly because the trains get stolen by UFOs.  I heard a physicist told me once.  Yeah, there was a cauliflower experiment in Roswell.  Bonnie.  Cauliflower.  Fucking what the fuck?  I don't even know what the cauliflower thing is still.  I fucking hate the word conclusion now.  I'll never use it.  I fucking hate it.  What's your conclusion?  Conclusion?  What would I have said there?  Nothing.  Nothing would have been good.  Nothing was probably the best. 
[02:59:00]  He gave a great theory on it for me to Triangle because we've all been wondering about it.  That's true.  It's the high traffic area.  I've never heard that theory before.  Put it in your pocket and put it right in your lips any time you do a fucking show.  God.  A little wordy, but I got it out.  We set up a bit for Rich today.  What was it called?  Still around?  The Cauliflower Experiment.  Have you ever seen him name celebrities?  No.  It's one of my favorite things.  I haven't done that in a while.  I know.  We've set one up for you today.  Fucking rich. 
[02:59:30]  Will cheese sauce affect the cauliflower conclusion?  My wife.  Shut up.  I want to hug Bonnie every time I see her.  I really do.  Just a fucking saint.  Oh, the poor girl.  Oh, my God.  Does Mars do this bit too, right?  You and Mars did it last time?  Because Mars is...  Is Mars a planet?  Oh, yeah.  It's Mars.  Yeah.  Sam's coming down the hall.  We'll see it out.  How do they know the black hole?  The simpleton questions are just the best. 
[03:00:00]  What was the word he fucked up on?  What do you call it?  The flip-flop.  Flozo.  What did he say?  What did his mouth just fall apart on?  After the conclusion.  What's your conclusion on the what?  The Twizzler theory?  The word of the Twiangle.  Twiangle.  He said Twiangle.  This motherfucker is 50.  You can't say Twiangle.  He literally pays his mortgage by speaking to other human beings. 
[03:00:30]  And he said Twiangle.  Twiangle.  On one of the number one fucking shows.  This is when you should have your shit together.  Wait, can I answer that?  He said Twiangle to a genius.  Do you understand how fucking...  Put in a room full of the Viper comedians.  Literally, we are the fastest guns in the fucking world.  Fucking Wes.  We should have shot you.  Okay?  And you say conclusion and Twiangle.  Twiangle.  You should have to quit the business for six months. 
[03:01:00]  He should be suspended from work for six months.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wait.  This guy knows about the cauliflower incident.  Let's go to...  Oh, it's a girl.  Sorry, Karen.  I didn't see the name.  Karen in California.  Hi, guys.  Yeah.  They were talking about the Kuiper Belt.  Oh, you think Kuiper Belt was it?  No.  Cauliflower?  Cauliflower?  I don't know where he fucking got cauliflower.  I'm going to have to listen to the replay.  I'm trying to figure it out.  All I know is he said when we're all sitting around talking about something. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  That's all you know.  You're a genius.  Yeah.  You're a genius.  Your IQ is off the fucking chart.  Here's what we'll do.  You pick a day.  Let's do that conversation over again without you.  We'll do the IQ test that I took online, me and Bobby.  We'll see who scores higher.  Here's the difference.  Here's why that doesn't work.  Why?  I never, ever, ever said I was a genius.  Oh, that's true.  I've never said I was anything.  Smart at all. 
[03:02:00]  Okay?  You run around saying you're a fucking genius, which fucking infuriates people.  I'm kind of like a savant.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I don't buy those online IQ tests either.  No, I buy them.  This one's tough.  I'll show it to you.  I buy them, just not alone in a room.  Right, right.  And then we have to trust you.  Listen, I'm telling you, this one is real.  If you showed me shemale porn and said, did you watch it?  I'd say no.  Uh-huh.  No, I didn't watch any of it. 
[03:02:30]  No.  Here's a link to a nice fucking chick with a dick.  I'm not into that.  I don't watch that.  All right.  We have something for Rich today.  Sam is in the studio.  It's a young Sam.  It's a bullet.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Ross, man.  God damn.  Oh, it was too good, man.  He's the best.  Doesn't that end the fucking segment?  You really are the best, Rich.  I would love to see a talk show.  It just goes on and on into commercials.  Yeah.  With Rich just asking. 
[03:03:00]  We'll be back in a second.  But before we go, would you get those shoes?  I could go explain.  It's always just self-serving.  All right.  Real quick, before I forget, Norton will be in Ontario.  Oh, I almost said Irvine.  No, Ontario, California, Improv.  Right.  This weekend.  He just flew out now.  Do you have to sneeze into the microphone?  Do you have to blow your nose into the microphone?  Live directly into it.  Directly.  Yeah, why not?  All right, well.  What do we got? 
[03:03:30]  This is going to be fun.  I can tell it's going to be fun because I can see fucking anytime something's going  to be mean and fun, Sam is glowing.  Absolutely.  Well, Sam's got pictures of celebrities, and we've learned over the years that Rich has  a tough time naming celebrities.  Yeah.  So we're just going to show a picture, and all Rich has to do is tell us who it is.  That's it.  Right, Sam?  Right.  It's going to be easy.  Are you ready for the first one?  Yeah, the first one.  All right.  Oh.  Well, never fucking seen her.  Come on.  Give me an initial.
