<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties involving Anthony's alien clips, followed by a lament over their inability to book A-list celebrities, despite employing a professional booker.  Their planned guest was Old Dirty, a recurring controversial figure. Andrew, a quiet, ghoulish-looking fan, was introduced as the news anchor for the day.  The hosts then graphically recounted a bizarre incident involving a photo of radio personality Bruce Kelly's exposed genitals, leading to a discussion of Jimmy's habit of photographing people's genitalia, including Ben's.  The upcoming release of a Harry Potter book prompted a discussion of the "Assault on the Media" contest, focusing on frontrunners Steve and Buffalo Paul.  They also reviewed "Wedding Crashers," ironically noting their failure to book any associated guests.  A call from Richard Cheese provided a musical interlude with his song "Shit Dick."  Further complaints ensued regarding the poor quality of intern food (a bruised orange and a cream cheese-less bagel), transitioning into frustrated commentary on the Yankees and the dismissal of a suspected lottery scam email. Listener calls followed, encompassing listener frustrations with the Yankees, workplace dress code issues concerning Sikhs and their turbans, and finally, Andrew's news segment, featuring a story about a cab driver robbed by individuals who recorded the event as a rap song.

The next segment prominently featured "Big A" (Andrew) delivering the news with a stilted, nervous manner and a noticeable difficulty with words starting with "ST," leading to a tongue twister challenge involving Big A, Steve, and callers. Big A's news items included a supermarket collapse where a baby was saved by a recalled stroller, Chief Justice William Frank Quest's hospitalization (later revealed to be due to thyroid cancer), Cameron Diaz's testimony in a lawsuit, Brad Pitt's release from the hospital for viral meningitis, Tiger Woods's lead in the British Open, and a bizarre story about a man's accidental death during sex with a horse.  Humorous moments stemmed from Big A's delivery, the tongue twisters, and the hosts' riffing on the news stories.  Side conversations included discussion of the documentary *Murderball* and a search for its explicit content.  The segment concluded with preparations for Big A's karaoke performance and a bit on exaggeratedly fearful local news teases.

A subsequent segment focused on mocking fear-mongering news teases, playing clips highlighting their perceived absurdity. Examples included stories about the dangers of soda, illegal sunscreen, and sex offender concentrations.  The hosts' commentary was sarcastic, exaggerated, and profane.  Stephen Rockland called in to comment on the soda story, adding his cynical perspective.  Callers discussed the teases and the sunscreen story, one revealing the location of the alleged sex offender zoning plan as Wilmington, Ohio.  Big A participated in a news segment and later performed karaoke ("Waiting for a Girl Like You"), with the hosts offering humorous commentary.  A song about "Special Ed" was played; Cooter from *The Dukes of Hazzard* and his criticism of the movie remake were also discussed.  The segment ended with further discussion and jokes about the sex offender story.

The final segment highlighted Big A's karaoke attempts, hampered by technical difficulties.  His performance of "Brown Eyed Girl" was met with interruptions and mockery from the hosts, leading to Big A's self-deprecating comment, "I fuckin' suck."  Discussions covered future segments, including movie scene recreations with Big A.  A listener poll showed Opie and Anthony slightly ahead of Bruce Kelly in popularity.  The hosts mocked Bruce Kelly with sexually suggestive and offensive comments.  A pre-recorded call to a "Tourette's Whorehouse" featured sexually suggestive remarks and Tourette's-related tics.  Celebrity impersonations followed.  A 911 call about a bad taco was played and debated, with the discussion becoming racially charged due to the caller's preference for a white officer; a former 911 dispatcher offered an opinion on the call's authenticity.  The death of Freddy Soto was mentioned.  Clips from "Celebrity Fit Club," featuring Bam Margera's father, Janie Lane, and Gary Busey, were played and commented on.  Listener calls discussed what they learned, concluding with plans to spoil the ending of the latest Harry Potter movie on live television.  Throughout, the hosts used profanity and engaged in crude and offensive humor.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out.  And I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  It's Friday, it's Friday, it's Friday. 
[00:05:00]  Stop it.  Good morning.  I would like to just get to know you.  Hello, cutie pie.  Hello, I see we have another star-studded show.  My alien clips need to be louder.  Which ones? 
[00:05:30]  My alien clips.  My alien clips.  My alien clips.  Which ones?  This one?  This one.  This one?  This one?  Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This can't be happening.  This is happening.  Nah, it's too low.  Well, that's great.  This is fucking great, man.  Now, what the fuck are we supposed to do?  It's the real pretty shit now, man.  He was great in that.  It's definitely too low.  What's this one?  Well, I got a couple of thousand goddamn questions, you know?  I want to speak to someone in charge.  I...  Eh.  What is that one on there for? 
[00:06:00]  Close Encounters?  Dammit, I know this.  I know what this is.  Yeah.  We'll fix that for you, Anthony.  Get some new ones on there, you know?  Yeah, I'm looking to spice it up a little bit.  I'm looking at the ONA Daily Prep Sheet, and it looks like another star-studded program.  Stellar.  Stellar.  I'll start by announcing the people that will not be on the show today.  Owen Wilson will not be on the show today.  Yeah.  Johnny Depp will not be on the show today. 
[00:06:30]  No?  No.  How about Ali G?  He was at the premiere last night here in New York.  Ali G will not be on the show today.  And we have a professional booker for this program.  Still?  I think so.  No way.  I think.  Mm-hmm.  That's great.  That's great.  Vince Vaughn?  Yeah?  He's coming in?  Will not be on the program today.  Oh, come on.  No baseball players will be on the program today.  Even though we have Major League Baseball on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:07:00]  I was going to say, it's not like, it's not like we got that.  Why can't we get ball players?  Why can't we get 99% of the people we'd like to get?  How about we get a Major League ball player from the year 1995?  Oh, there you go.  They're just sitting around waiting for their phone to ring.  Of course they are.  That's a good place to start.  You know?  Let's talk to Rusty Staub.  Rusty Staub?  I don't know. 
[00:07:30]  I can tell you who's going to be on the program.  All right.  Old Dirty.  Really?  Yeah.  Is he really showing up this time?  I don't know.  He resurfaced and supposedly he's going to be in the studio today.  He's an old favorite.  Yeah.  Now I got to sort through the instant feedback.  People going, I thought, isn't he dead?  That's another old dirty.  Another old dirty, you dopes.  He's from the hood and he gives us a nice perspective on what's going on in the world.  What's going on in the hood? 
[00:08:00]  And we got Andrew, who's looking very ghoulish outside the studio.  Ghoulish?  I don't know.  Well, what do you think?  It's not nice.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Looks like a gentleman waiting to come in and do the news.  Absolutely.  What's the problem, Opie?  He's the type of guy you see walking out of a nursery and then you walk in and all  the baby's feet have been bitten off.  What scares me is he doesn't laugh at those jokes.  What an image.  And he's a huge fan of the show. 
[00:08:30]  Yes, he is.  But Andrew will be doing the news shortly on the Opie and Anthony program.  Oh, I cannot wait.  Our new discovery, thanks to Danny.  All right.  Got a bit of a speech impediment, he says.  That's what it is.  Yeah, slightly.  Eh, just a little.  You barely notice it, but it's there.  Yeah.  Whew.  Anyway, do you like your Bruce Kelly picture there, Jimmy?  I do, actually.  You've got to love Bruce Kelly.  What a pleasant surprise yesterday as we all got in the elevator up here and went down 
[00:09:00]  to the lobby.  The elevator doors open up and who are we greeted with right when the doors open up?  Bruce Kelly, fresh in from D.C., I guess.  Yeah.  And he was going upstairs to interview Rick Springfield.  Yeah, and he was so happy to see us that he had a box of Kleenex.  Yeah.  On him.  He was just weeping.  Eh, guys.  He was dabbing as he was talking to us.  So he's wearing, I guess, his traveling clothes.  You know, you've got to be comfy, so he had these sweatpants on and, I don't know, 
[00:09:30]  some kind of a shirt.  And a towel.  Yes.  He had a towel around his neck.  What was that about?  I don't know, but I don't like anybody with that body wearing workout attire.  No.  It really bothers me.  What the hell was he wearing?  A towel.  Maybe that was for crying.  I'm absolutely crying here.  Maybe it's sop up his tears.  Maybe the Kleenex just don't do the job anymore.  Yeah, he needs a towel.  He needs a towel.  He's just bursting into tears wherever he goes now. 
[00:10:00]  God, with all the crying he does, you'd think he would lose some weight.  Like, God.  So, he decided to make a little joke with us.  So, he took the waistband of his sweatpants and pulled them right up to his nipples.  Well, because we talk about how high he wears his pants.  Paul always wears his pants very high.  So, he goes, hey guys, and pulled his pants up.  What this did was, I can't even describe what his junk looked like in those pants.  Picture a hand and picture the finger in the Khmer thing. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  It was like a crooked finger.  A crooked finger and a fist in his sweatpants.  Yeah.  His cock and balls were just bursting out of the sweatpants.  I had to ask him if he had just one large ball.  Yeah.  I hope he actually asked him that.  It was a mess down there.  And Jimmy, Johnny on the spot, grabs his camera and snapped a picture.  That's right.  So, we have this picture of Bruce Kelly's junk. 
[00:11:00]  I can see the outline of his helmet.  Isn't it disgusting?  Yeah, it's kind of creepy.  It looks like an x-ray.  It does.  It looks like some sort of an x-ray.  Let me see.  Let me check that out again.  That is horrible.  The close-up of his...  Should we be passing the camera around?  Oh, God.  Dude, you can see his vein.  You see the helmet?  Come on, let me see.  Look at the outline.  That is real bad.  It is an x-ray of his cock.  This is Jimmy's new hobby, by the way. 
[00:11:30]  To take pictures of people's crutches.  Holy crap.  What the fuck's going on?  I think he was almost getting a hard-on, too.  I think Bruce is a big boy.  That's why he's so confident and quiet.  He knows he has the goods.  Dude, that is a creepy picture, man.  You've got to get that up on the website.  That's Bruce Kelly's cock.  I think he was getting a little...  I think he was aroused.  He was getting a semi, man.  Bruce was filling up a little bit.  Oh, God.  That is so rude.  I've absolutely got a boner here.  I'm actually...  I'm absolutely leaking clear stuff. 
[00:12:00]  His mule's always crying.  But that's your new hobby, Jim.  That's fine.  Why not?  You've got a bunch of Ben's hog.  Oh, he snapped one in the office yesterday.  Ben was trying to get, like, a little impromptu, quick little meeting about something together  for about five minutes in the office.  He's just standing around.  He's sitting in his chair with his knees kind of apart, relaxing in his chair.  So, of course, I point to his hog and start laughing to Jimmy.  Jimmy turns around, pulls his camera out, and spins and takes a picture of Ben's hog. 
[00:12:30]  Ben gets, of course, as always, gets so self-conscious but doesn't want to let us know he's self-conscious  because then we win.  So, he slowly brings another chair over and puts it in front of him like he's leaning on it.  We know he's doing that to cover up his huge hogs.  He spent a lifetime finding large enough objects to hide behind him.  Buicks.  He found out certain things wouldn't work. 
[00:13:00]  Baseball bats, no good.  Smaller apartment complexes work wonderfully.  Just little things to stand behind.  To hide his shame.  Oh, that's classic.  Classic.  Yeah, he doesn't even look or acknowledge that we're making fun of it or looking at it  or snapping pictures, but then he'll always do something to completely cover it up.  Yeah.  You know, that's from a lifetime, a childhood.  Ben never made the transfer into adulthood like mentally with that, like where he understands  that he's a lucky boy.  Right.  He's still big head, large glasses, little body, and large junk fella getting pointed at 
[00:13:30]  from the girls going, ha, ha, that's who he is.  He wore sweatpants one day and he walked in and the whole class pointed and went, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  One of the times he was stopped in the store and accused of stealing when he hadn't.  Big weenie Ben, they called him back in those days, and he never got over it.  When he was a little boy, they thought he was stealing like a Steve Largent football  helmet from the store. 
[00:14:00]  Take that out of your pants, young man.  That was me.  Well, we've got to put up a montage of all those cross shots.  Oh, that's why I haven't put them up yet.  I want people to get a relative.  Because we also got Earl in Starbucks.  That was hilarious.  Yeah, Earl's is awful.  Because, you know, black girl, we want to see if the myth was true.  I don't think Earl's packing though, right?  We were, not really, I don't think so, right?  We couldn't see his pick if he wore cellophane pants.  Awful.  We distracted him and then was able to get a cross shot of him as well.  Hey, is the Harry Potter book out today? 
[00:14:30]  Ooh.  I hope so.  Well, I think it's released at midnight tonight and I will be waiting online at the bookstore.  I didn't have it queued up.  Nah, you gotta have the crickets.  Sorry.  I'll wait.  All right.  I'm car crashing your crickets sound.  You set me up, you fuck.  Wait.  Anyway, someone out there has to have the Harry Potter book by now, right?  I think it's been leaked, but yeah, they're very strict about putting that out at the proper time. 
[00:15:00]  I want someone to just read the last line of the book on the show today.  The last line of a book usually doesn't give away anything.  Well, we could start there.  It's usually just kind of like the follow-up.  How about we have someone read the last line of the book and then try to figure out what's going on?  Go backwards?  Backwards.  Backwards.  Backwards.  Actually, we got a guy that is on the line and he has a Harry Potter spoiler.  Oh.  All righty. 
[00:15:30]  Ben?  What's up?  Hello?  Hey, what's OT.com?  It's a website.  A what?  A website.  No shit, man.  We know that.  Jesus.  What do you think, I was born yesterday?  The website.  HTTP colon slash slash www.  People used to give you addresses like that?  He's acting like we're four years old and he's got to explain what a website is.  A website.  Thank you, Ben.  That's the only...  Ah, whatever.  It's forums that aren't filled with shit dicks like Whack Bag. 
[00:16:00]  What does it cover, my friend?  Mr.  Off-topic.  Whatever.  All right.  Anything.  They've got Photoshop, O&A listening threads, whatever.  And are you in charge of that site?  No, I'm just a little pissant on the site, but I figured I would call in with some Harry  Potter info.  All right.  Do we want Harry Potter info?  Do you think I even care about the book or the movie or anything? 
[00:16:30]  No, but I know there's people out there who will be spoiled.  I managed to piss off a bunch of my friends last night by leaving that in my away message.  Well, we know somebody dies, right?  Yeah.  And there's a little love affair, right?  Yeah, yeah.  How do you know so much about Harry Potter if you don't care about it?  I was...  I know a little bit about everything.  Does Harry die?  That's what I know.  I forget.  Aristotle. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, fuck.  Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  I somehow pick up tidbits of it.  We're both just giving you that look like we just like, I don't know, sucked on a lemon.  Do you even know stuff about stuff you don't want to know about?  I don't want to know.  Oh, it's my curse, Opie.  It's my curse.  Oh, there.  They're doing it on the news.  A little Harry Potter book is out.  Oh, how cute.  All right.  Well, you have a spoiler. 
[00:17:30]  Okay.  Who dies?  All right.  Well, before that, the half-blood prince of the title is Alan Rickman's character.  Alan Rickman.  Professor Snape.  It turns out he's a bad guy or whatever, and he kills the old guy, Professor Dumbledore,  in front of Harry, no less.  Wow.  So, apparently, the end is Harry, you know, bitching and moaning about how he's going  to go kill Alan Rickman.  Uh-huh.  So, I figured, you know, I don't know. 
[00:18:00]  I remember the Star Wars bit, like, what was that, five, six years ago.  Uh-huh.  There are a lot of bookstores open at midnight, and it could be a good attack on the media for  those so inclined.  Oh, my God.  That would be really good.  Holy crap, you're onto so much.  Go out and announce that, because that's a huge spoiler.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Where?  At the actual?  At the bookstores that people are waiting online until midnight to buy the book.  Well, we'll see.  The Atlanta ending out.  I guess we'll see Monday if anyone has the balls to do it. 
[00:18:30]  You've got to record it, obviously, for the show.  Does anybody have, like, one of those, like, something Anthony has right next to him?  A bullhorn.  Does anybody have a bullhorn?  You need a bullhorn.  You need a bullhorn.  You need some kind of recording device.  And you have to get the Opie and Anthony name in there somehow.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony say.  Yeah.  Uh, now what about the, uh, horrid love affair?  Um, apparently Harry, uh, I don't, it's a little, the details are a little...  That little red-haired boy and Harry? 
[00:19:00]  Right.  One can only wish.  One can only wish.  Now that's a real twist for you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Monster rain.  I don't want to say what happens, but in the last chapter, Gary Glitter walks in with a camera.  Oh.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, real.  Yes.  Oh, that, dude, that is hilarious.  Yeah, we got it.  Although, I will say, most of the people online for the book are probably parents buying it for children who can't be told no, but there might be enough of the-  It might be enough of them.  I don't know.  There's really some geeky people that are into the Harry Potter books. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, I know.  And the parents, it'll be a special night.  They'll bring the kids to the bookstore.  They're all dressed like Harry Potter, little kids rubbing their eyes because they're so sleepy.  Keep your kids at home, you creeps.  Really?  Out till midnight.  Someone's going to ruin it.  I got to tell you, this, I don't know.  You could be in the lead for the assault on the media contest for July if you do that.  That'd be a good one.  That would be a huge one.  Oh, how about a catch it on the news? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  On the news, the 11 o'clock news, people waiting online, they'll go to a live shot from one of the big bookstores.  Shock jerks.  Oh, and just hold up an O&A sign and announce the end of the book.  Oh, that is a winner.  If you get that on live TV, I think we have to announce that contest is over for the month.  It's over.  That's right.  Over.  You not only get the MiFi in a day in studio, but you get like a carbonite thing of Bruce Kelly's genitals. 
[00:20:30]  Well, all right.  We'll throw that out there.  Yeah.  You know what to do, people.  Pull that off.  You know what to do.  I'm sure it'll be a Barnes & Noble somewhere.  Oh, my God.  A Barnes & Noble in your area.  All right.  What do you think wins in a fight?  Ben's junk or Bruce's junk?  Ben kills it.  Ben's junk, you think?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Bruce's junk looked pretty impressive.  Ben's looks impressive in loose dungarees.  Jesus, Bruce pulled it like a mummy wrap. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  Just had a...  Who's wooden in that?  Ben did that?  His pants would have burst at the seams.  He tried to wrap the pants around.  If he pulled his sweatpants up, the waistband would have gotten like to his waist and then  just stopped.  He couldn't pull any higher.  No higher?  There's no more material left.  All right.  Just had to ask.  All right.  Thanks, Ben.  All right.  Lil Jimmy, what do you do on July 23rd?  Oh, thank you.  I'll be in Cleveland at the Odeon.  You're a good egg.  All right.  See you later, shit dick.  Bye, Angel.  There he goes.  Ben from OT.com. 
[00:21:30]  That's a great idea.  It's a website.  Indeed.  Ass.  By the way, dude.  That's the dot com at the end.  What the...  The assault on the media.  We're asking you guys to vote for, you know, who you think has the best assault on the  media for the month of July.  Yeah.  How's the voting going?  Well, Steve was like kicking major ass and now we're very suspicious in the back office  that Buffalo Paul has some underground campaign going on.  You think?  That's what I'm thinking. 
[00:22:00]  That's what Ben's thinking.  Why he's kind of pulled in the lead or...  It's pretty much tied, right?  You go to opiananthony.com and you can vote for the best assault on the media for the  month of July.  We're going to do this every month, by the way.  And we need everyone to vote.  Steve's had a great one in Boston where he was topless and had wow stickers over his  man boobs.  Wow.  It is almost just about neck and neck.  Steven in Salem, Mass has 409 votes and Buffalo Paul has 400 votes.  Huh.  How did that happen? 
[00:22:30]  I don't know.  And, you know, there's other people planning to, you know, do an assault on the media before  the end of the month, so it doesn't mean that it's going to be one of these two.  No.  And, you know something?  Yeah.  The voting, it's our decision, right?  We take the voting maybe into consideration, but, yeah, if somebody does it the last day  of the month, they're not going to get a lot of votes.  If it's really good, they're going to be the winner.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, this was just between these two because these two were the best so far.  Yeah.  You know, there might be another guy out there that's going to just blow everyone away. 
[00:23:00]  You never know.  Someone that might wear a wacky costume or something.  Who knows?  I love the wacky costumes, people.  The Gumby suit.  The big dancing bear.  Just, uh, if you could put on some kind of suit, you're almost guaranteed a win.  We love the assaults on the media, so go to opiananthony.com to see what that's all about, okay?  Roy.  Uh-oh.  Jimmy's laughing at something in the paper.  What happened, Jimmy?  Oh, these guys.  Everyone knows that the Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn thing, I just can't wait to see it because 
[00:23:30]  it just looks really funny.  And the, uh, the posters, you know, life's a party, crash it.  It's like, my God, these guys are crazy.  You know, that's what you need, just two really good-looking guys just crashing a party.  You know, that's, that's comedy.  It's getting rave reviews.  Of course it is, as it should.  And, uh, here in the Daily News, they just, they're incorrigible.  There's a picture of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in the suit jackets.  And he, Owen Wilson always has that, that pursed lips look, which is kind of seductive  and funny all in one, which is really a hard combination to achieve. 
[00:24:00]  And they're both standing there with their pants around their ankles.  Oh, no.  It is amazing.  Oh, good gosh.  But the beautiful thing is their faces don't give it away.  Owen still has the Percy look.  I tell you, how do you not just crack up?  Look, their pants are down.  Pants are down around their ankles.  And these guys are just really, really nuts.  What are they trying to say with that shot?  Who knows?  I mean, we're nuts, and boy, it's working.  That they got caught with their pants down?  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  Yeah, wedding crash.  Jimmy just does not like them.  No, I think they're terrific. 
[00:24:30]  They're terrific.  I think you appreciate Vince Vaughn.  I wouldn't know Vince Vaughn.  I don't know one movie he's done.  Really?  Did you watch Old School?  No.  I didn't.  I don't know one movie he's done, and I know they're both better actors than I am.  I went to acting class yesterday.  Acting lessons.  Fancy lessons.  I was going to make him a big star until I realized he had no talent and a weak chin and a fat neck.  Vince Vaughn carried Old School.  I never saw it.  Everyone talks about how that was a Will Ferrell movie.  That was a Vince Vaughn movie. 
[00:25:00]  Vince Vaughn's pretty funny.  He's really funny.  I'm not a big Owen Wilson fan, though.  I've got to tell you that much.  And he's actually a good actor.  You've never saw Bottle Rocket?  Yeah.  What?  Bottle Rocket?  Which film was that?  First film.  I guess the film that put him on the map.  What?  What is it?  It's just a great little indie film.  I might have seen it, but I don't remember anything about it.  Oh, boy.  Did you help me?  To kind of do a caper.  A caper?  And he's just all weird and stuff through the whole movie. 
[00:25:30]  Gets his crew together to do a little caper.  A caper?  Who else is in it?  That might help.  Honestly, I don't know.  I don't know.  It was a lot of nobodies, really.  They're writing.  They're writing on a sign in the other room to hold it up.  I have an internet movie database right there.  Oh, yeah.  Luke Wilson, of course.  Luke Wilson was in it.  Yeah.  His brother, Luke Wilson.  Of course.  Yeah.  No, I didn't see Bottle Rocket.  Might want to check that out.  It's pretty good.  Yeah.  Someone on the phone here wants to talk about the Harry Potter book.  Jeremiah?  Spelled weird? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, Jeremiah.  What's up, Jeremiah?  California.  How much, boys?  What's happening?  How are you?  I know the ending to the Harry Potter book.  All right.  He finally comes up with a spell to shrink Ben's hog down to normal size.  Uh-oh.  Bucking out.  Yeah, you better.  Dear Lord.  Dear Lord.  Yeah, dear Lord.  All right.  So, Wedding Crashers, that's getting huge reviews today in New York.  Yeah.  Not one person from that movie or premiere could we get on the show. 
[00:26:30]  No, of course not.  No.  Those are big stars.  Yeah, we don't get big stars for some reason.  Big stars.  Not one.  We get peripheral people, people that have been shunned by the industry.  Let's do it ourselves today.  TV people.  If you're a big star and you're listening to this program today, give us a call.  Yeah?  Give us a call.  If you're a big star, give us a call today.  I think a lot of big stars have XM in their radio.  They do.  And if you're listening to this on a replay, next time we're live, give us a call. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Because our talent book are just, I don't know.  Ah!  Eh.  They get mad when we bitch about them, but this is what I'll say.  Ah!  I think they book them for elsewhere.  I don't think we're thought about very much.  No.  You've got to get someone to book the show who's hungry, who cares about this show being  booked.  Yeah.  That's the key.  Getting someone who wants this show booked.  If you've got like five different people, places you're trying to book, it's like, oh,  you want to do this one?  No.  Oh, how about this one?  This one?  This one?  This one?  This one?  Okay.  Hell, our own company can't get people on this show. 
[00:27:30]  We have Major League Baseball.  They were at the All-Star Game.  A massive display for XM up there.  Massive.  Huge.  All the bigwigs went up to Detroit or wherever it was for the game, and we couldn't get one  player on.  Not one.  How does that happen?  I have no idea.  Do you think players are on other stations?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  They couldn't be that afraid of this show.  It's an impossibility.  We're just dumbbells.  We're not slaughtering animals in here.  We're just three idiots chatting.  So if you're a big star, give us a call right now, okay? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Please.  We could use your help, because the booker isn't getting it done.  But it's not just the booker.  I mean, we're not getting them from in-house or anything.  It's nothing.  Yeah.  Well, that's an area where the show needs to grow.  We'll get the job done.  I hope so.  You know, Big Kev is at that San Diego comic convention, the Comic Con.  It's like the big one.  I saw a commercial for it last night, and apparently, like, Keanu Reeves is there, and 
[00:28:30]  Jessica Alba, Angelina Jolie, and I'm laying in bed, and my girlfriend says, oh, look, all  the people Big Kev won't even get close to.  That's so true.  He might if he puts on a King Tut outfit, and they're like, hey, the guy from Batman.  Who was that guy?  I remember him.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, the old Batman series.  Kevin has perfectly parted psychopath hair.  He has hair like Andrew.  Only a psycho has a hair parted that neatly. 
[00:29:00]  Andrew's a huge fan of the show, and he hasn't laughed once.  He hates us.  No.  He hasn't laughed once.  No laughter.  We've had some chuckles in this first half hour.  Let's just look at him.  He's getting all uncomfortable.  He's really creepy.  Look at him.  Is he sweating?  He's ghoulish and creepy.  I don't know.  He has Lego person hair, and it scares me.  He's going to be doing the news for us in a few minutes here.  There he is.  Oh, it was Victor.  What?  King Tut, you mean?  Yeah, that's him.  Victor Buono?  Yeah.  B-U-O-N-O? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, that's close.  I guess if he'd grow a beard or something.  Anyway.  Andrew looks like somebody, maybe like some big guy that you'd put on Jupiter for a while  and just let him, like, let gravity just suck everything down.  Doesn't he look like he's stretching, kind of?  He looks like you're stretching.  He looks like an alien from Men in Black.  That's a good one, too.  Or Total Recall, you know, with the weird eyes. 
[00:30:00]  I, the mutant, you know, the chick put a red wig on him.  He is a creep.  Oh, jeez.  Anyway.  Martha Stewart has a TV show coming on NBC.  What is the attraction to this person?  I don't understand it.  Jessica Simpson?  The women.  That's obvious.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  That video for the Dukes of Hazzard that Jessica Simpson is on, it's ridiculous. 
[00:30:30]  She is in a bikini cleaning the General Lee.  Oh, my God.  And just, oh, just stop it.  Dude, I think this is intended to be sexy.  This is even about the movie.  Holy crap.  Do you know what?  You got, you know what the credit is to her body?  Is the fact that she is so fucking annoying that she is still hot.  There are chicks that are hot, but they're so annoying it takes away from their hotness.  Yeah.  There is nothing that takes away from that hotness right there.  Look at that ass.  Jesus.  She is ridiculous. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, man.  Anyway.  Look at the Today Show showing that.  Yeah.  And then they show these.  Midlander Housewives holding one of them holding a Carole King sign.  Jesus.  Ugh.  All right, anyway.  At least Jessica Simpson can sing.  At least she can, you know, she has a voice.  She's not a complete lack of talent.  Who cares?  Yeah, I know.  I wouldn't care if she pelted out to us like Babe Ruth.  I'd still think she was lovely.  Hey, one of our friends checking in.  Richard Cheese.  Richard!  Good evening, fellas.  There he is.  Congratulations.  The biggest star to check in.  How are you? 
[00:31:30]  I know.  I'm huge.  I don't know how I got through, but I'm huge.  Richard Cheese.  Fellas, I've got to tell you, that Shit Dick song is top of the charts as far as I can tell.  It's a phenomenon.  We haven't played that in a while.  I've had so many wonderful ONA listeners email me begging me to put that on on CD.  It is really good.  I'm so grateful that you guys, you know, handed us that gem of a composition to record.  Are you guys playing it in concert yet? 
[00:32:00]  No, we actually, I did it on a different radio station, you know, an uncensored, you know,  an FM broadcast station in Los Angeles.  They didn't want to hear it.  They didn't even know the original.  How many people do?  Kevin and Bean?  No, actually, it was a college station.  Oh, okay.  So, guys, I want to thank you again for having me on.  And, you know, really, the ONA fans have been phenomenal, and I've made a shitload of money 
[00:32:30]  off of that, so thank you.  At least he's honest.  Always good to milk the fans.  Did you guys go to the Bowery Ballroom show that we did?  I don't remember if I saw you there or not, but it was really a huge success.  It was unbelievable.  Well, I was in the back row, and unfortunately, I had somewhere to go after the show, so I  couldn't go backstage and say hi to you.  It was a good show.  It was unbelievable.  We were all there.  Good.  Thanks, guys.  I didn't know.  Well, thanks so much for coming out, and, you know, I'll be back in New York hopefully 
[00:33:00]  in the fall.  We'll do a...  What was the encore you did?  I loved that song.  It was...  Oh, what the hell was it?  I don't remember.  We were going drunk.  Yeah.  A little help.  You came out for that encore, and you did that song.  Oh, Pussy by Lords of Acid.  Yeah, that's the one.  Yeah, it's a good song.  What night of the week was that open?  It's a love song.  It was a...  It was a...  I went on a Friday.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you guys went on a Friday night. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, it was Friday.  Friday.  We went...  But, you know, we did the show, and then we went.  Yeah.  Because then we had to go somewhere else after that, so...  So, anyway, guys, thanks again so much.  Went down to the cellar.  And, you know, I'm just grateful, and I really...  It was great to see you guys, and I'm glad it's going well.  And, Jim, thanks, and I love you guys, so...  All right.  Now, let me clear the lines for the next big star to call in.  Bye, Mr. Cheese.  Thank you, Mr. Cheese.  Thanks, fellas.  We'll see you soon.  Well, there you have it, guys.  A huge star, Richard Cheese.  Richard Cheese.  We're looking for all the big stars out there to give the program a call. 
[00:34:00]  So far, it's Richard Cheese.  Richard Cheese.  Well, that's our starting point right there, which means if you're, you know, Voss, don't  bother calling.  You have a bigger star.  Who would be a bigger star, Richard Cheese or Voss?  Voss has been on television a lot, though, with that...  Voss is bigger than Richard Cheese.  Yes.  Yeah?  Okay.  Wow.  Why don't we go to break?  That's where we're starting, then?  Before we go to break, can I wonder why my apple, my orange has a black eye? 
[00:34:30]  Where did he...  What is that?  Dude, it's not an orange.  It's a yellow, first of all.  A yellow and green.  It is yellow and green.  These interns are all beat up already, man.  Dude, look at this.  Would you bring this as food to somebody?  What is that?  It's a line.  It looks like a can of dust bomb if she were fruit.  All the oranges in that store were freaking mushy.  Where'd you go?  I had an international food market.  I'm sure that's a nice place for Al-Qaeda to recruit members.  Where is that?  International food market.  They told me Jimmy likes his apple and orange from the international supermarket down the 
[00:35:00]  road.  International supermarket.  I don't care where they come from as long as they're fresh.  I just hate food in New York.  Look at that mess of an orange, Jimmy.  It's yellow and green, and it's got a bruise on it.  This orange should come with a robe.  That orange definitely has a lot of problems.  It stinks.  The top of it is very green.  It's jaundice.  It is.  You played drums from Motley Crue.  I hate this stupid orange. 
[00:35:30]  Sorry about that, Jimmy.  He needs a new orange.  All right.  Well, I'm going to be a new orange.  Yeah, I'm not trying to be a prima donna.  I just want an orange that hasn't been punched.  You're right.  You're right.  And then Danny just threw a bagel or something at the window.  Yeah, they're freaking...  Everyone's food is awful today.  What happened with Danny's bagel?  I thought it was $7.20.  Wow.  Yeah, I...  Behind the equipment?  What time did they send you out?  They sent me out about $6.40 with 10 orders.  Oh, boy.  Danny, what's the problem with your bagel?  There's nothing on it. 
[00:36:00]  No side of cream cheese in the bag, and it's my fault, and I apologize to Danny.  Oh, my God.  It's supposed to be a garlic bagel as well.  They were out of garlic, so I didn't want to be presumptuous and get you something else.  Remember when that was you, Danny?  That's right.  Remember when you were the guy that was coming in here, and we were yelling at you about the food,  and now he's yelling about the food.  Oh, and he's a bitch about the food.  I love it.  He just opened the tinfoil at the bagel and pointed like the evidence is here.  I like his tactic, though.  You tell me what's wrong with this.  I'm not going to tell you.  You tell me, because you know. 
[00:36:30]  I say that would give Sam a little respect, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's related to Thomas Jefferson.  That's true.  Right, Sam?  Tell him.  I am.  No, it's true.  I am.  He is related to Thomas Jefferson.  But, yeah.  You know, I screwed up the food order.  That's right.  It doesn't matter who my relatives are.  Good point, Sam.  What Thomas Jefferson was saying is, hey, this place is bogus.  I think that's pretty impressive that he's related to Thomas Jefferson.  We don't get cream cheese pronto.  It will just be bogus, too. 
[00:37:00]  All right, well.  I apologize for all the, uh.  God, these interns are walking around like beaten men.  Oh, remember the first day they were all happy and chipper?  Now they're walking around.  Just happy to be here.  Now they're walking around with their heads down.  A little beaten.  Unshaven, unkept.  They're just, like, losing it.  I'm so happy to be here, though.  You see what can happen to an intern, though, when you look at some of the gentlemen in there being very well paid.  Yeah, see?  Or paid, at least.  Yeah.  That is the incentive, the booth of incentive right there. 
[00:37:30]  They look good in there.  I'll say they do.  It's the booth of dreams, really, because you come in here, an intern, and look where you can end up.  That's right.  A paid employee sitting there mocking the intern.  Absolutely.  Pointing and laughing.  All right, Sam.  We'll go see what I can fix.  Thank you.  All right.  Good luck to you, buddy.  Good luck to you.  And I know you have to get a bunch of food orders, but there's eight interns.  Can we ever send two when food has to be back here by seven?  The other ones are doing something.  What?  Very important.  We really don't know.  I would like to know what.  I mean, look, I just want my stuff before I go on the air, so I don't have to chew on the air. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave in New Jersey.  Dave?  Good morning, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Dave.  Hey, in between breaks yesterday, I flipped over and listened to Howard, and the batching has begun.  He's, according to him, you're extremely unoriginal.  Yeah.  He's going to kick your ass, and you're nothing.  All right.  Oh, that's good.  What context was he saying in him, though?  All right, we're going to go to break with Richard Cheese doing one of our faves. 
[00:38:30]  Someone else said that Howie was talking about how his father, when he used to, I guess, be in the radio station and do some weekend stuff,  actually invented, and this is serious, somebody said this, invented the underdog character on his show.  So, yeah, and then someone ripped it off.  So, he's actually saying that his father invented stuff that was ripped off.  As well.  Wait a minute. 
[00:39:00]  Was that his mule that Brando was tooting on?  Maybe.  All right.  We're going to go to break with Richard Cheese doing...  Shit Dick.  We love it.  Oh, yeah.  That's a little better for me.  It's always important to take a good song and give it that lounge style.  We hate all shit dicks.  We hate all shit dicks.  We hate all shit dicks. 
[00:39:30]  We hate all shit dicks.  Andy Warhol.  Shit Dick.  Mick Jagger.  Shit Dick.  Michael Jackson.  Sean Molester and Shit Dick.  Allegedly, Jeffrey Dahmer.  Cannibal.  Shit Dick.  Butt slamming shit dicks. 
[00:40:00]  Rock Hudson.  Shit Dick.  Liberace.  Shit Dick.  Jim Neighbors.  Shit Dick.  Robert Englund.  Freddy Krueger.  Freddy Krueger.  Shit Dick.  Fizz fucking shit dick.  We hate the fucking shit dicks.  The fucking shit dicks.  Fuck those shit dicks. 
[00:40:30]  Thank you shit dick over here.  Wow.  The highlight of the week right there.  Nice job, boys.  Thank you.  Bravo.  Richard Cheese in the band.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  I'm in a good mood because his stupid socks are winning and winning and winning.  Seven games in a row.  Seven games in a row.  Two games in a row.  Ben doesn't even do jokes at you, though.  He'll just list the facts. 
[00:41:00]  He just does that.  Hey, dude.  Seven games in a row.  Seven games.  I'm not a comedian like you.  Seven games.  Seven games.  Isn't that wonderful?  And the Yankees' big thing is they have to like, oh, they didn't get swept by the Mets.  Oh, I love it.  And they're talking like it's the best thing ever.  Yeah.  Great.  Big meeting with the boss of Tampa tomorrow.  I know.  It's going to be things done.  Steinbrenner in Tampa.  I'm sick of them.  I'm glad they're getting their faces smashed.  I don't want to see Giambi and Randy Johnson in Yankee uniforms.  Can there be no just enemies of your goddamn team?  Mm-hmm.  Holy shit is that aggravating. 
[00:41:30]  A-Rod's that one right here, though.  A-Rod.  Definitely.  I like A-Rod only because he was a bat for bat.  But why?  Stop buying it.  And I never was one of these guys that said the Yankees bought the team.  I was never one of these guys.  No.  I like farm system guys.  Fuck.  Ring them up.  Somebody you can watch over the years and appreciate their growth.  Well, there's talk they're going to trade their top three picks.  Of course they will.  For another.  For some pitcher.  And it's either Barry Zito.  There you go.  Barry Zito sucks my dick. 
[00:42:00]  Top three picks, Jim.  Like the top three prospects in the organization they're talking about trading.  Jesus Christ.  They deserve to get the shit beat out of them for that.  Goddamn Steinbrenner.  When he was out of baseball, this team was built up.  And they won three out of four years.  Oh, is that frustrating?  Yes, it is.  God damn it.  Can we take one year where you just admit like, all right, this is going to be an off year.  We're going to let some of that young talent develop.  Any team.  Pick your team around the country.  You'd rather give up the young talent, get a name, and flounder. 
[00:42:30]  That fucking Barry Zito, I can't tell you how...  I'd rather have Bob Kelly's leg pitching for the Yankees than that fucking Barry Zito.  Cocksucker, that's aggravating.  Catch my fistball, man.  I hurt my dynasty, man.  God damn it, is that frustrating.  Fucking Barry Zito.  And Randy Johnson, what do you have an issue?  That's one guy they're talking about.  They're talking about a bunch of different pitchers, but he's one of the ones that's taking care. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, who else?  We bring Jim Abbott back, cocksucker.  Bob O'Hita.  Holy God, is that aggravating.  Toby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  That's all that's about.  Yeah.  Well, I could go home.  Why?  I don't have to work anymore.  Why?  I just checked my email. 
[00:43:30]  Uh-huh.  It says, Lotto Draw, Master Mega Million Lottery Winner Notification.  Be notified that on the 9th of July, your email address was selected on the Computer Promotional  Ballad System Draw as one of the winning email address on the Internet Computer Lottery Draw.  They didn't play my address?  Sounds legit.  No.  Sounds legit.  This program was held by the South African leading national lottery organization.  There was Computer Ballad, which qualify you as winner of sum of two million U.S. dollars. 
[00:44:00]  Wow, well worded.  For more inquiries and information, please contact Mr. James Cameron.  That's what it says.  Wow.  Who knew?  Yeah.  I won.  And then it tells you at the bottom here to call them up and not to tell anybody about  this because there's a lot of scammers out there. 
[00:44:30]  How many of these do I get a day?  Every day.  That might be real.  Mr. Paul Morgan, Eagle Treasure, South Africa.  He's got his phone number.  Can we call South Africa from here?  I don't know.  Let's try.  We've never tried to make a call out of this place.  Well, give somebody here.  Take this number and call because I've always wanted to call these guys and see what they  say when you finally get them.  Yeah, let's do that.  Some international number.  Let's write down that number.  Andrew's getting ready for the news.  He's freaking out outside the studio.  Absolutely freaking out. 
[00:45:00]  That's what it is.  I don't know what that means.  They're wacky numbers when you call international.  Is it actual numbers, though?  Yeah.  There's a plus sign in front.  There's a plus sign.  That might mean after you dial the country code.  I don't know what that means.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  It's just what this is.  It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 numbers.  With a plus sign?  And you think we're going to get someone on the phone?  How do you dial a plus?  You've got to use a calculator to dial your phone.  I'm going to look on my phone. 
[00:45:30]  Is there a plus sign?  There is a plus sign.  Yeah, but that's for text messaging.  Call Mr. Paul Morgan at that number.  Let's go to Bill the Trucker.  Bill, what's up?  Hi.  This is a guy that calls day too late for a bit guy.  It's day late for a bit guy?  Hey, Colin.  Do I hear you're playing at Caroline's all weekend?  You're a two days late guy.  You're a two days late guy. 
[00:46:00]  You just wrecked your own character.  Very good.  Yeah, that was really funny to listen to yesterday, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, trying out new characters for the program.  Let's say hi to Jay in Boston.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Jay?  How you doing?  How's it doing today?  All right.  Yeah, what's up, Jimmy?  Nah, anyways.  I just wanted to say, fuck the Yankees and the Yankees suck.  Why, sir? 
[00:46:30]  Because they suck.  Fuck them.  They won the ball game.  Where are you from, Jay?  I'm actually from Boston.  I'm actually, believe it or not.  How could you guys guess?  All right.  Well, I think the Yankees took care of you last night.  Yeah.  Dispatch.  Yeah, why do you guys think I'm fucking calling?  After a shaky beginning.  Yeah, Curt Schilling looked awful.  Poor Curt.  Old bloody sock.  Didn't look too good last night.  What happened?  A-Rod hit the ball.  Gave up that homer to A-Rod.  All right.  Why don't we move on here? 
[00:47:00]  What were we doing?  I think we were just going to go, ugh, to all the Sikhs who want to work at the TA and  wear their turbans on the job.  Oh, the poor Sikhs.  Come on.  Cut the Sikhs a break.  I don't hate the Sikhs.  The poor Sikhs are being beat up because people think they're terrorists.  I don't want them beaten up, but how about this?  You leave that thing at home.  Yeah, leave your stupid towel hat at home.  No one should know what religion you are.  When you're riding a train by looking at you.  Yeah.  No one.  You wear the uniform or you get another job.  End of discussion. 
[00:47:30]  And there are a lot of uneducated people out there that will just beat you up for it.  You've got to be a nut to walk around with a turban on.  Even though none of the terrorists wear turbans.  Can't these people join our dress code, though, please?  I know.  Enough already.  Jimmy and I were walking home the other day.  There was a lady completely covered.  You can only see her eyes.  And it's 100 degrees out.  Yeah.  It's like, what are you doing?  Nice middle of the summer in New York City.  You're in America.  She's wrapped up.  Can you at least join our dress code a little bit?  Maybe get a Gap logo on the damn thing or something. 
[00:48:00]  Stop with your multicultural.  No one cares.  Maybe get a little Puma thing on the side of your attire.  They want to wear turbans.  But what is the TA saying no?  Of course they are.  They're like, no.  You wear the hat that we have.  You don't wear your own religious hat with an MTA symbol on it.  They've got to wear the TA hat, right?  Well, if it's part of the uniform, then.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  But people think that their religion is more important than that.  And it's not.  Put on the uniform.  Have some pride. 
[00:48:30]  Those boys down at the Transit Authority expect you to wear that uniform.  It's part of the Transit Authority.  Oh, wait a minute.  I think the bottom line is they're letting them wear it if they wear an MTA sign on the  turban.  And they don't even want to do that.  On the turban?  Yeah.  That would look ridiculous.  How do you think it looks good without one?  No.  The whole turban thing is ridiculous.  Enough already. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Why don't we get Andrew in here to do some news for us?  All righty.  Andrew, I don't know.  What do we say about this guy, Anthony?  Well, he's a fan of the show.  Yeah.  He takes a lot of pictures.  Yeah.  He has a speech impediment.  Yeah.  We discovered him on the streets.  He gets a little nervous.  The other day when we were getting ready for the WOW motorcycle ride, that was a huge  success to Philly.  He's been to a lot of my brother's shows.  Yeah.  Takes a lot of pictures.  Yeah.  He posts on the message board.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  And he's now in the studio.  And he drives an independent cab.  Oh, that's right.  In the Bronx.  I forgot about that.  Which is very dangerous.  You hear about those guys that were robbing cabs?  And they were found because they found a CD on their possession.  And it was a rap song that they recorded bragging about how they robbed cabs.  Jesus.  Brilliant, isn't it?  They made a rap song detailing how they robbed these cabs.  They would call up a cab to have them meet them at a corner or a house address. 
[00:50:00]  And then three or four guys would run out from the parked cars with bandanas around their mouths.  Tell them, Fred.  And they would put guns in the guy's face, steal his money and his cell phone, and then  slit his tires so he couldn't follow him.  And then they made a rap song about the whole thing?  And then they made rap songs about how they did it and what they did.  And then the cops found the CD when they arrested one of them for, I'm sure, helping out to doing some kind of public service, I'm sure.  Right. 
[00:50:30]  You ever been robbed, though?  Not yet, no.  Never?  Not.  How long have you been doing it?  Over ten years.  Ten years and you've never been robbed and you work in the Bronx.  Do you not pick up certain people?  Is that what you do?  Yeah.  Not really.  I pick up the calls, I'm told, off the phone.  Off the phone?  Yes.  So if you hear somebody go, yo, I need a cab, man. 
[00:51:00]  You go, oh, sorry, I'm booked.  And then if you hear them go, hello, I need a ride out of this horrible neighborhood.  Then you're on your way, and that's helped you from being robbed over ten years.  Yes.  All right.  Good system.  What's the craziest thing that happened to you while driving a cab?  The craziest?  For the while, you know, just a memorable moment in your cab driving.  Oh, one time, I had to pick up a customer, and they were picking up their clothes and belongings in Jersey. 
[00:51:30]  Uh-huh.  And I think the wife and the...  What's the matter, Opie?  Opie, you didn't even get to the funny part of the story. 
[00:52:00]  Opie.  Is it the tapping fingers thing that's getting you?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, I'm figuring it out.  I'm just not a nice person.  You're evil.  Oh, God.  I'm trying to show my nice side lately on this show, but it's tough.  All right, go ahead, Andrew.  I want to hear, Andrew.  I do.  Let her rip.  Um, so, um, I had to drive her out to Jersey to pick up her belongings, and either her husband 
[00:52:30]  or whoever, it was very uncomfortable.  Oh, what?  The husband was there?  She was leaving?  Yeah, pick up all her belongings, her bags, her belongings, everything.  You were picking them up?  Well, uh, she was picking them up, and I had to take her to New Jersey and back to the  Bronx.  What was she picking up?  Um, all her belongings, bags, and...  And the husband was there? 
[00:53:00]  And he didn't want her leaving?  All the belongings.  All the belongings, yes.  He didn't want her leaving?  Was that it?  Um, I don't know.  It was kind of uncomfortable.  I don't...  I mean, it was kind of uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable.  I understand.  Were they arguing or no?  A little bit.  I wasn't paying attention much.  Went to that special place mentally.  Uh-oh.  Are you a gentle giant?  Yes, I am.  Okay, good.  You look strong.  You're probably very strong.  It looks like you have retard strength. 
[00:53:30]  I would want to take...  He's got big forearms.  Yeah.  Is your orange, uh, to your liking?  It looks a little off still.  It looks kind of yellow, and, uh...  John, it's...  Yeah, but that might just be the season.  Yeah, okay.  Ooh, Travis has the camera.  All right.  Anyway, don't...  Don't get nervous.  Okay.  It's no big deal with the camera and stuff.  Yeah.  What's the ring on your finger?  You got a ring on your left pinky.  Is it a class ring?  Oh, actually, I was, um...  I was the head of equipment manager  of a football team in the Bronx  of John F. Kennedy Knights Football. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, wow.  Awesome.  Equipment manager.  What does that entail?  Oh, I guess...  I'm taking equipment and...  Managing it?  Managing it.  Would you carry their belongings?  No, no, no.  They wouldn't shoot jockstraps at you  in the locker room or nothing, right?  Oh, no, definitely not, no.  No, no.  How about if you asked nice?  Football team in the Bronx? 
[00:54:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Must have been a good team.  That year, they were undefeated.  Uh-huh.  The coach gave the whole team  of rings and watches.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Nice.  All pulled off of livery drivers.  Yeah.  Tax.  I'm sure those are all  in small manila envelopes 
[00:55:00]  waiting for their release.  Those little possessions.  All right.  There's a little bit more  about Andrew,  the cab driver from the Bronx.  Yeah, look at that.  Are you ready to do  the news there, Andrew?  Okay.  Are you up on the news  on a daily basis?  I know a lot of cab drivers  listen to the news stations.  Are you up on the news?  Oh, yeah, pretty much, yes.  You kind of know  what's going on day to day?  Oh, yeah, pretty much.  I do.  All right. 
[00:55:30]  That's good.  Keeps you educated.  All right.  Well, do we have  our little ticker?  Yes, we do, Anthony.  We need the ticker.  Do you have, like,  a nickname or anything, Andrew?  Ooh.  Friends of mine  call me Big A.  Big A.  Yes.  Big A.  Big A.  All right.  They call you Big A?  Yes.  That's funny  because they say  Jim has the Big A.  Why do they call you Big A? 
[00:56:00]  It's because I'm tall.  And his name would be,  yeah.  It's with A,  that big.  Big A.  Oh, okay.  Yo, Big A,  we need some more helmets  over here.  Something like that.  Big A,  hand me that piano.  And you say  your friends call you this.  Yes.  You hang out  with your friends  on weekends and stuff?  Sometimes, yes.  Guys you've known a while? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, a long time, yes.  Is the tapping thing  like an OCD thing?  Just asking.  So how about your  fumbling?  Is that something?  I like you, Andrew.  You got a set of balls.  You got some set of balls in it here.  I like that.  What's the world coming to?  He fights back.  I like that.  In person. 
[00:57:00]  I've admitted I got OCD stuff going on.  Okay.  Wait till I start...  Don't hand him the poker chips.  Sadistic son of a bitch.  He gives me the poker chips  that they've been trying to keep away  from me for months.  No, is it though?  Seriously,  I know a little bit about OCD  and it looks like you're tapping out  on some kind of pattern there.  Is it a pattern  or he's just kind of  finding the words  and tapping a little nervous?  Or is it like,  yeah,  you're trying to find a rhythm?  Because sometimes  I do that with my foot.  That's the tapping  you hear in the background.  Yeah.  That's not distracting.  Sometimes he does it  with a yogurt spoon 
[00:57:30]  and a yogurt container.  Jimmy's much worse  about that than me.  I swear to God.  You put it right on the mic  and go...  On purpose.  Yeah.  All right.  Well,  very good, Andrew.  I like someone  that fights back.  You ready for the news?  Thanks, baby.  Of course, yes.  Oh, Jesus.  What a terrible, Jimmy.  You're going to get  some kind of sexual harassment  lawsuit against you  from a guy.  That's going to make  some great headlines someday.  Thanks, sweetie.  Right. 
[00:58:00]  Cutie pie.  All right.  Here we go.  Start to teletype.  With the news,  it's the big A.  Stroller Saves Baby  and West Side Collapse.  A supermarket  under demolition  collapsed  onto Upper West Side  pedestrians yesterday.  Among the five injured  was seven-month-old 
[00:58:30]  Abigail Lewinsky,  who was seated  in an urban  double-mounted buggy.  What caused the collapse?  Just reading the news.  They don't...  You ever watch the news, Jimmy?  They don't all of a sudden  ask the anchor  questions like that.  That's our part.  You just let the guy  do the news.  And then we talk about it.  I'm not going to comment.  I'm letting  Big A read the news.  Well, it was a big story  in New York yesterday. 
[00:59:00]  Andrew seemed very informed.  He may have read the article  and maybe have some answers.  A whole building collapsed  and this baby was saved  because of the stroller  the baby was in.  Right.  And that same stroller  was recalled the day before,  by the way.  Because it's dangerous.  Because it's dangerous.  And it saved the kids.  Sorry.  What do you need, Sam?  He's asking me  for my password  for my computer.  Why?  Can we get this off air  for feedback?  Why would you want  his password?  They want me  doing feedback in the office  because the monitor 
[00:59:30]  is out in the cubicles.  Does one of them  have the password  while we're in the middle  of this, no?  No, Ben said  he knew it was something  but he didn't know.  Totally what it was.  He told me to come in here  and rank you  in a little knock.  Alright, this ain't going  to distract the flow  of the show or anything.  Alright, we'll wait  for Jim to give  the password out.  Oh, now the teletype  stopped.  This is great.  We're in the middle  of a bit.  We're doing stuff.  We're doing something.  What a bad position  he's put in.  Sorry, guys.  Ben tells him  to do something. 
[01:00:00]  I don't.  Anyway, we're talking  to Big A.  Big A's doing the news here.  So that's pretty much  the story.  The building collapsed  and the baby was saved.  I don't know how many  people were injured  or anything.  No, it's not on your sheet?  How many of you think  were injured, Big A?  It's not going to be  on the paper.  Wow.  You either know  or you don't know.  Prepare that news.  I don't know, no.  You don't know?  No.  The baby was saved  by the stroller,  I think, right?  Yeah.  And that stroller  was recalled the day  before for being dangerous. 
[01:00:30]  Are you serious?  I swear to God.  That's the little  cute twist in the story  that Andrew didn't have.  Maybe it causes  building collapses.  There you go.  Your stroller  causing building collapses?  I'll wait for the new  news teases that we got.  Maybe we'll do it  right after the news here.  All right.  Go ahead, Big A.  Next story.  Okay.  Next is  Frank Quest.  I'm not  going to quit. 
[01:01:00]  Chief Justice  William  Frank Quest  said last night  he will  pay on  the Supreme Court  as long as  my health  permits.  My health  won't allow it.  No.  My hands  won't allow it.  Okay.  Continue.  All right.  Frank Quest  released  the statement  hours after being  released 
[01:01:30]  from an  Arlington,  Virginia  hospital  after being  treated  for two days  with a fever.  He got  the fever.  Nice.  Very good.  That was informative.  He had a tough time  with that story though.  Yeah.  He did a good job.  Why did he have a fever though?  Did I say what was wrong  on him finally?  Because I did hear  the news today.  And do you know  what he's responsible for?  He's got the thyroid.  He's got the thyroid.  He's got the thyroid cancer.  Do you know  anything about him?  He's the 
[01:02:00]  chief justice.  Ah.  Very good.  All right.  He is.  All right.  Way to look deep  into the story.  I like this kid.  Big A.  Yeah.  Big A.  Big A.  All right.  The next  is  topless  and proud of it.  Oh.  You're  sexy.  This is a  sexy story.  Sexy.  Cameron Diaz  testified  yesterday  she doesn't 
[01:02:30]  regret posing  topless  for pitches  as 19-year-old  unknown.  In fact,  I thought my boobs  looked good  she said  but denied  she ever  signed away  her rights  to those  racy  shots.  Right.  All right.  Diaz  32.  Yeah.  Ah,  more. 
[01:03:00]  Diaz 32  took  center stage  in a criminal  trial  against  photographer  giant  Buddha.  Photographer.  Photographer.  No,  it's  photographer.  Photographer  only.  I said  photographer  many times.  It's not my guy.  It kind of throws you  for a loop.  It's not good to me,  man.  Yeah.  Photographer.  So what's this story  about there,  Andrew?  John  Buddha,  who was accused  of forging  the actress's 
[01:03:30]  signature  on an  authorization  release  in a bid  to pump  $3 million  out of her.  Ah,  whew.  That's,  yeah,  I remember  seeing,  I saw those  pictures.  You ever see  them?  She's topless  wearing some  kind of leather  thing and  a little S&M  looking.  No?  No?  You ever saw it?  You've found them  online.  I did not.  All right.  Why don't we  move on  with the news  with the big A. 
[01:04:00]  Actor Brad Pitt  released  from Los Angeles  Hospital.  Films  star  Brad Pitt  was released  on Wednesday.  Wow,  that was a tough  one,  right?  That was a little  weird.  I'm noticing  that ST  words really  kind of throw  you for a loop,  don't they?  But he tapped  four times  before he said  star.  You guys  found that out,  huh?  Yeah,  the STs  are a little...  It's all about  the ST?  Yeah,  it's the ST. 
[01:04:30]  Can we get  one of those?  The S's  and STs.  STs are the rough  ones.  As a start  or any part  of the word?  The beginning.  The beginning,  mostly.  The start.  That's not  big deal.  It's not like  there's a lot  of ST words  in the English  language.  No.  Jesus.  Let's get a  tongue twister  with the STs.  Is there one  out there?  Or maybe the  listeners can come  up with a quick  one on instant  feedback.  Yeah,  it's the ST thing,  huh?  An ST tongue  twister.  How about  start,  step,  stop? 
[01:05:00]  He's trying to  kill me now,  huh?  He's trying to  kill me.  I just didn't  even notice it.  All right,  let's get back  back to the  Brad Pitt story.  He's a big  movie,  movie,  celebrity.  Celebrity.  That's great.  All right,  yeah,  keep going.  Brad Pitt was 
[01:05:30]  released on  Wednesday from  a Los Angeles  hospital where  he had been  admitted for  flu-like  illness that  turned out  to be  viral  meningitis.  His spokesman  said no  further information  about his  condition was  offered.  good for him. 
[01:06:00]  He's out.  A lot of  people were  worried.  Went over  there to  Africa.  God,  our listeners  come up with  the lines we  should be  coming up  with.  Go ahead,  Earl.  Hey,  what's up,  boys?  Hey.  Is that a  news picker  or his teeth  chattering?  That could be  long.  That's good.  Wow.  Very good.  All right,  back to the  news teletype  there,  yeah.  Okay.  Go ahead, 
[01:06:30]  Andrew.  We're almost  done,  right?  Woods  leads  British Open  by one  stroke.  Tiger Woods  was positioning  himself to  win another  British Open  at St.  Andrews.  Woods  claimed his  first Open  title in  2000 at  the old  course,  and he  was one  stroke ahead  of Mark  Hensby  after a  six under  66 in 
[01:07:00]  the first  round Thursday.  Ah,  a little bit  more about  that story.  Tiger Woods  also admitted  that his  mom was  like a block  away from  one of those  subway bombings  in London.  Oh,  yeah?  Yeah,  that came out  yesterday during,  I guess,  his press  conference.  Playing on  the links  of St.  Andrews.  He invented  the game,  you know,  called it  golf without  the L.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  Continue there,  Andrew.  Very famous  golfer.  Save the news.  He's going to  do another  news report.  What's this?  Oh.  Oh,  a tongue  twister.  All right.  You want to do  the tongue  twister now  or his next  story?  Let's see  this one.  Yeah,  let's do  the tongue  twister first.  Where's Steve?  Let's get  Steve in here  because he has  perfect diction  so we can get  the contrast  here.  You going to  be a good  sport and  try this  big A? 
[01:08:00]  Of course.  Yes.  Wow.  This,  I can't even  do this.  I know,  that's why  we need  Martini Steve.  We're admitting  this is tough  to say.  It's Martini  Steve.  All right.  We can't hear  that anymore.  I know,  we rarely  ever do.  It's Martini  Steve.  Martini  Steve.  It's Martini  Steve.  What's up,  Steve?  What's up,  fellas?  Here it is.  Here's my  copy.  The yin  and yang  right here.  This is an  ST tongue  twister.  Physically,  they could be 
[01:08:30]  twins.  Yeah.  As far as  speech goes,  they couldn't  be further  apart.  I would  hesitate to  agree with  you there.  I would  believe me,  Andrew's not  jumping up to  be happy with  my comparison  either.  All right,  Steve.  A skunk  sat on a  stump and  thunk the  stunk  stunk.  Bleh.  See,  Steve can't  even do  this.  The words  are pronounced  properly.  That's a hard  one.  A skunk.  But the 
[01:09:00]  stump thunk  the skunk  stunk.  Six  sticky  sucker  sticks.  Strict  strong  stringy  Stephen  stretch.  Six  sticky  sucker  sticks.  What's  wrong  with you?  Six  sticky  sucker  sticks.  What did  do wrong  there?  Six  sticky  sucker  sticks.  A skunk  sat on  a stump  and thunk  the stump  stunk,  but the  stump  thunk  the skunk  stunk.  You got  the inflection.  All right,  and six  sticky  sucker  sticks and 
[01:09:30]  strict  strong  stringy  Stephen  stretch.  Forget these  guys.  Let's get  Boston here  to do one  of these.  We need  wetsuits,  snorkels,  because you  didn't know  what the  words were.  Bravo to  Anthony.  Oh, thank  you.  Now throw the  word finger  in there and  see if you  can redo  that.  She said,  bring her my  finger.  Bring her my  finger.  Take your  finger and  linger longer.  Finger.  I say it  right now.  I know,  because I 
[01:10:00]  think linger  in my  head.  Finger.  That was  the biggest  laugh during  the replay  yesterday.  That whole  finger thing  was hilarious.  All right,  let's go with  the big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Let's rip  with the  first one.  A skunk  sat on  a stomp  and thunk 
[01:10:30]  was  stomp  was  stunk.  Oh, baby.  But the  stomp  thought  was  skunk  was  sunk.  Oh,  wow.  Wow.  I am 
[01:11:00]  perspiring  over here.  Holy  shit.  During the  replay,  listen really  closely to him  tapping the  paper.  Oh, I know.  He tapped  it about ten  times before  he could get  to, I forget  which st  word.  That st  is really  a bitch.  That just  hangs you  up.  Has anybody  ever told you  what that is?  No, you've  never been to  a speech  therapist?  When you  were a kid  or something? 
[01:11:30]  When I  was a kid  and also  in junior  high school  but nothing  after that.  They never  told you  this is  this problem  they have  a name  for it  and it's  called  the STs  or something  or nothing?  No, nothing.  No?  STD?  STD.  Listen to this  line.  Paul in  Northport.  Go ahead,  Paul.  So apparently  Andrew has  a problem  with STs  and Jimmy  has a problem  with STDs.  Ah, yes.  I just said  STDs before.  I know.  This is a new  character.  It's three seconds 
[01:12:00]  too late,  guy.  I didn't see it  or I would have  said it as you  said it.  Let's say  how to  Jerry in  Miami.  Here you go.  Stella stared  stoically at the  stoplight.  Stella stared  stoically at the  stoplight.  Can you say that?  That's one.  No?  Don't you want  to try that one?  We'll come up  with another  ST tongue twister  before the end  of the show  today.  How about  the last one  on the list?  Oh, I thought 
[01:12:30]  he was done.  No, strict,  strong, stringy,  Stephen Stretch.  Oh, I thought  it was done  also.  Oh, yeah.  All right, give it  a shot there.  The last one.  Give that, yeah,  strict, strong,  stringy one.  Um, um, strict,  strong, um,  stringy,  Stephen Stretch.  Oh, okay.  It doesn't seem  like the STRs are  as much of a  problem for you  as just the STs. 
[01:13:00]  Like, stump is  pretty hard.  Um, yeah.  Yeah, it's very  hard.  Yeah.  All right, let's  get back to the  news.  That's something  that's right.  I can't buy this.  All right.  Back to the news  with the big A.  Um, the medical  examiner's office.  I hope, I hope  they say Stella  Stevens is dead.  No?  That's what the  medical examiner's  office.  No, actually,  she just had a  stroke.  Oh. 
[01:13:30]  In Stoughton.  Let her, let her  rip.  All right.  Sorry.  Oh, yes, Jimmy?  Is she in  Vincent's?  Yeah, take a  little drink of  water there, big A.  Yeah, as you  drink the water,  let's go to the  phones and talk to  Buddy Hinton.  Buddy Hinton? 
[01:14:00]  Hey, Buddy!  Hey!  Baby talk, baby  talk, it's no wonder  you can walk.  Set that dog  rule.  Oh!  Baby talk.  All right, here  we go.  Is this the last, I  think this is the  last story, right?  You stop that, Buddy  Hinton.  for this hour?  Okay.  All right, go ahead.  The medical examiner's 
[01:14:30]  office ruled the July  2nd death of a man in  South King County was  accidental.  of a man apparently  died after having  sex with a horse.  Whoa!  Here's a funny story.  The sheriff's office  detectives believe  the council took  place near a farm  in unincorporated  King County. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, shit.  It's going to be a  fucking holiday inn.  There's a fourth floor  walk-up in Crown Heights.  All right, go ahead.  Beastiality is not a  climb in Washington.  It's not?  No.  Hats off to  Washington.  Get those bags  packed, folks.  Take this show on  the road.  I'm going to watch  Andrew rape a little 
[01:15:30]  piggy.  Just a little one.  Again.  Just hold it.  So if they call  from Washington,  we could have  girls having sex  with dogs and  stuff on our show?  Is it Washington  State or is it  D.C.?  Not D.C.  Andrew, can you  sing or anything  like that?  Someone's asking  if you could sing.  Actually, I do  karaoke.  Not often, but I 
[01:16:00]  do karaoke.  Oh, my God.  Okay, we need a  karaoke machine.  Someone get a  karaoke machine to  111 57th Street  immediately.  What song?  What do you sing?  What do you sing?  Yeah.  Everyone has that  song they always pick  on the karaoke machine.  That's true.  Which one is yours?  I usually pick,  what though do I  pick?  A lot of,  damn, now I forgot.  Like,  God, I can't even  remember what I  sing now. 
[01:16:30]  Andrew, what song  do you sing?  I swear to God,  she was moving when  I left her.  I sing Neil Diamond.  This is why Eric is  part of the Opie and  Anthony show.  Oh?  Because we abuse him  on a daily basis.  We?  I came from Danny.  Look at Danny  eating his bagel,  just going, yeah, me.  No, it was me.  Where do we get this,  though?  Tizzit.  It doesn't matter  where we got it.  Well, it matters that  Danny gets the credit.  That's right.  He's got a bunch of  karaoke songs.  Stop it.  We got like 15  choices, and we  could have Andrew  pick one, maybe  work on it in the 
[01:17:00]  other studio.  Wow.  And he comes back  and does it for  everybody.  How's that sound,  Andrew?  Okay.  All right.  Let me see the  songs.  What do we got  here?  I Love Rock and  Roll, Joan Jett,  Reelin' in the  Years, Steely Dan,  Waiting for a Girl  Like You,  Foreigner.  What would you say  your range is?  You sound actually  like you have a  pretty high voice.  He should do  Waiting for a Girl  Like You.  Yeah.  All Right Now  from Free.  Got a little BTO  Taking Care of  Business, Brown Eyed 
[01:17:30]  Girl, Always from  Bon Jovi, Blaze of  Glory from Bon Jovi,  Born to be Wild as  you know, standard.  That could be a good  one.  Fleetwood Mac,  Dreams.  Do we have lyrics here?  Yeah, we can print  those up, right?  Yep.  November Rain, maybe,  a little Guns and  Roses, Paradise  City.  Hey, there's quite a  few choices there from  quite a few genres.  Just stand by me.  You know, this horse,  stand, be by me,  be by me, when you're 
[01:18:00]  weak.  I think any one of  these songs will be  radio gold, so we'll  give him the CD and  he'll pick the song he  wants.  Pick a song, let him be  comfortable with it.  I'm hoping he does  Waiting for a Girl Like  You or Born to be  Wild.  Born to be Wild, I think,  could be the hit.  That's a good one.  I think we can work  that to mainstream radio  if you do a good job  with that.  Yeah, definitely.  All right, this horse  story sounds a little  interesting, huh?  People are suggesting,  yes, Stairway to Heaven. 
[01:18:30]  She's flying in escalators.  But this horse story, so  what, the guy had sex with  a horse?  Sex with a horse and  he died?  Of what, a heart attack  or something?  A kick?  What did he have?  Did you read that whole  story there, Andrew?  Big A, sorry.  Big A.  He's reading it now.  No cause of death?  No cause of death? 
[01:19:00]  No cause, no.  All right, we'll find out.  All right.  I guess that's it for the  news.  Yeah, that's a great job,  by the way.  Here, take the karaoke CD,  Big A.  What song do you think  you want to do right off  the bat?  You know those songs on  there?  At least a few of them.  We'll get them the lyrics.  Familiar enough with the  the way they go?  Um, um, um, a little bit.  Yeah?  You've heard them on the  radio and stuff.  Oh, of course.  So you're kind of familiar.  It wouldn't be like you  trying to put words to a 
[01:19:30]  song you have no idea.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Uh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, it's the big A,  everyone.  Big A.  I say he does Born to be  Wild.  You think?  What do you think?  Oh, okay.  Is that the one?  I mean, it's kind of hack,  Born to be Wild.  Yeah, but a version of  the big A can be pretty  funny.  I think I like the  Farner one, though.  A girl like you was a  good choice.  Yeah?  All right, yeah.  It's not going to  trip him up.  It's a lot of range on  that one.  Yeah, he'll do fine. 
[01:20:00]  All right, let's do  Waiting for a Girl Like  You.  Like, almost anyone  could do Born to be  Wild.  It's just a matter of  yelling it out.  You can do that  gruff, Bond.  Yeah.  Waiting for a girl like  you would take some  vocal styling.  Would show his softer  side, I think.  Right.  It would be very nice,  because you are looking  for a woman.  Every psychopath has a  soft side.  Someone's suggesting  that he should sing  Starry, Starry Night.  It's not cloudy.  It's not cloudy. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  What do you like  this Andrew guy?  All right, Andrew.  Good boy.  Good job.  You can leave the  studio there.  Investigating the  owner of an area  farm, Seattle man  died from injuries  sustained while having  sex with a horse  boarded on the  property.  Okay.  Death was accidental  and the result of  having sex with a  horse.  surveillance camera  picked up a license  plate of the car  that dropped the  man off at the  hospital.  Trying to see what  the investigators 
[01:21:00]  found chickens,  goats, and sheep on  the property.  They are looking into  whether animal cruelty,  which is a crime,  was committed by  having sex with  these smaller,  weaker animals.  That horse did  not want to be  fucked.  No shit, Sherlock.  That's great.  No shit.  How would you feel?  You're pulling a  carriage around all  day, people are  bugging you, and  all of a sudden,  uh-oh.  Yeah, oh boy.  Like, I don't give  enough to these  people.  And the cue to the  horse was, like,  every time he sees  the guy walking in  with the little  stepping stool.  No.  No.  I'm not bringing 
[01:21:30]  that in to brush my  back.  Because the other  horses, like, are  looking at him from  across the stool,  and they all just  have to avoid eye  contact.  And he walks in  with the stool.  Oh, is that awful?  They're all eating  oats, and he's just  going to stand there  with a little tear  on the side of his  long face.  Why the long face?  Why the long face?  I was right there.  He, uh, he, uh, I  would gather he  probably got kicked.  That's great.  Probably got kicked  right in the, uh, in  the body there, and 
[01:22:00]  just busted  something open.  What else could  happen while you're  having sex with a  horse?  You just hear,  Ah, Dune.  Ah, Dune.  Ah, Dune.  All right, um,  I'm not going to  race him.  I'm just going to  fuck him everything.  And the Godfather  didn't kill him.  He committed suicide.  I was going to make  him a big star.  Well, star me up  would be another  good one for Andrew.  Yes.  For Andrew.  You know, Anthony,  I think it's time to  develop a road show. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  We got enough of  these freaks, uh,  around now that we  could exploit.  I think they just  have a lot of  personality.  I'm thinking we  could have some  comedy, some cover  band stuff, and then  these guys singing  karaoke would be a  wonderful night for  everybody.  You know, Big A is  showing himself to be  educated and, uh,  and, uh, witty.  Yeah.  And, uh, pretty sharp.  And he likes to  fight back.  I like that.  I know.  He's feisty.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  All right, uh, time  of my life into break.  What do you think?  Oh, this is great.  One of my favorites 
[01:23:00]  of all time.  I listen to this on  the replay while I'm  driving home or at  the house, and, uh, I  laugh every time.  I guess they do these  karaoke things and  record them at  amusement parks.  They have, like, you  know, you ever see  those things, recording  session, come into the  studio and cut a  record?  Well, there was a bunch  of, uh, retarded  people they took to, I  think, Great Adventure  down there in Jersey.  And, uh, two of them  went in the booth and  did, uh, I had the  time of my life from  Dirty Dancing.  And somebody recorded  it, and somebody even  smarter, uh, leaked it 
[01:23:30]  out over the internet, and  we got a copy of it.  I had the time of my  life, now I never felt  this way before, yes, I  swear, it's the truth, and I  owe it all to you.  Cause I've had the time of  my life, now I've always 
[01:24:00]  lost the view.  I've been waiting for so long,  now I've finally found this  fun to stay by me.  Yeah, we're riding on the  wall, and you felt the magic  called fantasy.  Yeah, every time you get it  all right, it's the way we 
[01:24:30]  could decide secretly.  Yeah, we take each other's  hands, something that you  understand, just our teeth.  just remember what you're  for the one—  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I tell you something, this  could be love because I've had the 
[01:25:00]  I've had the time of my mind that I've never felt anything before.  Yes, I swear, it's the truth that I'm all in you.  And my body and soul, can you know that you never know? 
[01:25:30]  No!  So tight, still as well to go, be afraid to lose control.  No!  Here I know you saw your mind, you say, stay with me tonight.  Me! Stay with me, brother.  One more one day.  I can't get in above. 
[01:26:00]  I'll tell you something to turn me on because I've had the time of my life that I never felt afraid anymore.  I'll tell you something to turn me on because I've had the time of my life that I've had the time of my life that I've had the time of my life and I never felt afraid anymore. 
[01:26:30]  The End 
[01:27:00]  The End 
[01:27:30]  The End 
[01:28:00]  Hey, what's that? 
[01:28:30]  You've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have. 
[01:29:00]  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  Is...  Is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo.  It's Friday! 
[01:29:30]  Friday!  Friday!  Friday.  Thank God.  You're checking out the O&A virus spreading across America.  You're watching us rebuild our radio careers slowly but surely. 
[01:30:00]  Brick by fucking brick.  Right.  Trying to keep it from collapsing on a baby carriage.  Help us out and spread the virus for us, okay?  If you like what you're hearing, you tell somebody.  Spread it!  Spread the goddamn thing.  Spread it already!  And don't use a condom.  We got Andrew outside the studio.  He's working on his Waiting for a Girl Like You karaoke thing.  That's such a haunting song.  Can I throw something out there on question almost for listeners?  Sure, Jimmy!  Throw away!  Sometimes I'll ask the listeners for help or advice because you guys are wackos but you do have some knowledge. 
[01:30:30]  I had a little bit of work done in my apartment recently and I have a...  Like, you know, your sand stuff, dust kicks up.  A lot of dust.  So now it looks like two days after a nuclear explosion, that little thin layer.  You have like, yeah, the nuclear winter stuff that came down.  I feel like a fly on one of Ben's mirrors.  It's just like, it's a little dusting.  So I have to... 
[01:31:00]  Don't say that stuff.  I think I have to call...  Yeah, that's what makes him think.  It's not the movements.  It's not what it is.  Walks like the chick from the ring.  Right.  By the way, this is the guy, not to interrupt you, who I want on the program.  I went and saw Murderball.  What a great freaking movie.  And I think the star is doing interviews.  We've got to get him on the show.  Who, Vince Vaughn?  No, sorry, Jimmy.  I totally interrupted you.  I don't care.  I saw the guy from Murderball on TV and it just... 
[01:31:30]  Who?  No, what's his name?  I don't know his name.  Basically, Murderball is a documentary about the paraplegic USA rugby team.  And you would think these paraplegic guys would, you know, it'd be a cute little sport that  they're doing to, you know, waste time.  Yeah.  They take it really, really seriously and they showed that in this documentary.  It was amazing.  I'd be very impressed if they played against people who aren't paralyzed.  Yeah, that's tough.  These guys, you know, redo their wheelchairs.  What was the name of the guy that played the ball? 
[01:32:00]  Cheap shot.  And they just bashed the crap out of each other with their wheelchairs.  Really?  Yeah, they redo their wheelchairs, make them really strong and sturdy.  It's unbelievable.  It's a great documentary.  They, like, hit each other with their wheelchairs?  Oh, hard, man.  Fly out of them?  Yeah, people are falling out of their wheelchairs, flipping.  They take it really seriously.  They're not strapped in?  Yeah, they're strapped in pretty good.  So the wheelchair falls over and they're kind of just like...  Oh, they need help getting up and stuff.  But it shows, I gotta tell you, I'm sure other people out there have seen this movie. 
[01:32:30]  They show that these guys are really athletes.  And they train, and they take it very seriously, and it's the real deal.  And they're getting laid and everything.  Really?  They're getting laid.  Most of these guys had girlfriends and stuff.  Yeah.  And I learned through the movie that, you know, even though you're paralyzed, you know, downstairs  still works in most cases.  And there's a video that they only show in the film for maybe 10 seconds.  Because they showed this one kid who was a motocross guy that just got paralyzed. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  That was part of the movie.  It was a real drag.  They showed him in rehab and trying to figure out what the hell he's going to do with his  life.  And by the end of the movie, it looked like he got very interested in maybe joining the  rugby team, paraplegic rugby team.  And they kind of showed him a video about how, yes, you could still have sex with your  girlfriend back home.  And they show this doctor in this video, and really dry delivery, basically talking about,  you know, what you have to do to have sex while you're in this position. 
[01:33:30]  So they got to pump it up or something?  No.  Supposedly you could still, you know, get hard and all that.  Still get the blood in there?  They showed a girl completely naked, grabbing her, you know, paralyzed boyfriend, you know,  like kind of a bear hug and falling backwards onto the bed.  And that's the only part of the video they showed.  That video has to be out there somewhere.  And we need it.  We need it.  Yeah.  We need it.  Oh, we need it.  We definitely need it.  So there's a project for someone out there to help us try to find that sex video. 
[01:34:00]  I'm sure it's in the credits.  I'm sure it's in the credits of that movie.  But, you know, if you're looking for a different type of movie, Murderball was just really,  really good.  Really good.  Anyway, sorry, Jimmy.  Back to you and your apartment.  It was actually, it was just, I had this layer of dust that I can't get out of the cracks  of my grout now.  I have this white dust on my black floor and in between all my floorboards, and I don't  know how to get it out because like an ass, I took a mop and figured that would help  it.  And then Anthony, I told before, he goes, oh, you made cement? 
[01:34:30]  You made cement out of it now.  Great.  You grouted your wood floor is what you pretty much did.  Oh, wow.  So it's stuck now because of that?  It'll come out, but it's just, it's in there.  It wouldn't have anyway because when you step on it, it just grinds it in.  Because, you know, the contractors, when you're going to have, you know, stuff all over,  why would you put down actually a piece of plastic?  You're supposed to put down something.  Now, what were they doing?  Cutting through some drywall?  A wall, yep.  Cutting through so it's the middle part of the drywall.  The gypsum.  The gypsum board.  What?  Gypsum. 
[01:35:00]  How do you know that?  Oh, yeah, you did that.  That was in stupid construction.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Very interesting show.  Yeah, I heard at the end of the Harry Potter novel, oh, by the way, the gypsum all over  your floor.  God.  Gravity technically happens.  It's to the point now that Jimmy and I are on the same page.  You're just making us look really stupid.  I don't mean to.  Jimmy and I just immediately look at each other and just go, oh, there are things that come  out.  I'm sorry.  We have to change the opening of the show.  Can we get you on Jeopardy, please? 
[01:35:30]  Let's get it over with.  Just get you on Jeopardy.  But I don't know everything.  It's a little bit about everything.  That's all you need to get on Jeopardy.  A lot about everything to be on Jeopardy.  And if Millionaire was still popular.  Millionaire.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  Is that even on?  Yeah.  And syndication with the chick from The View, I guess.  You're supposed to put down a drop cloth, though.  All over, especially nice wood floors like you have.  And you're supposed to put that down so it doesn't happen.  And then clean up.  The guy is supposed to clean up all that dust with a vacuum before he leaves. 
[01:36:00]  They did some sweeping, but it was just awful.  Yeah, sweeping this dust right into the cracks of your wood floor.  Awful the way they handled it.  And my kitchen floor is black.  So you've got these little white lines in between the black.  It's just, I want to bite this contractor on his face.  Black tile?  Yeah.  Oh, that's got to look nice.  Big black tile.  Oh, here's a tip coming in.  I've got to see your place.  Yeah, the tile.  That's really nice.  Mikey from Missouri has a great tip for you, Jimmy.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Use a water pick.  A water pick will get that crap all out of your, in between the slots on your wood. 
[01:36:30]  Imagine using a water pick on your wood floor.  Dude, I bought toothbrushes.  I was going to do, I need a marine.  I was actually.  Going to just brush the dust out of there?  Yeah, and I was hoping that, you know, somebody wouldn't walk up and step right where I had just brushed.  Hope they would walk around.  You know, I never turned down a photo opportunity.  Why don't you bring Andrew back home with you?  Welcome to iWireless. 
[01:37:00]  Oh.  The customer you have dialed is not available or has traveled outside the coverage area.  Oh.  Please try your call again later.  We didn't dial anyone.  All right.  Oh, so a water pick.  Wouldn't that wreck your wood floor?  Yeah, that isn't good.  Not if you dry it.  You don't want to get your wood floor wet.  No, not if you dry it up right away.  You don't want to be putting water in between the slats.  It causes any real problems.  Do you even want to do that in the kitchen, though?  I don't even want to do that on the grout in the kitchen.  Dude, I had a river flowing through my living room on my wood floors and it barely damaged them.  So I think you'll be all right with a water pick. 
[01:37:30]  There's got to be some kind of a vacuum treatment that you can put down that seeps in and gets that kind of stuff out and just gets sucked up.  There's got to be some kind of a professional floor cleaning thing, which I don't know what it is, and I want to bite the – not the guy's face, but I want to hold his face gently and bite the bridge of his nose.  Ow.  I want to bite the bridge of his nose for that immigrant he had in there, sanding and sawing and not covering the floor.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you cover a floor?  You're supposed to cover the floor, and then you're supposed to clean up every mess you made, dust and everything. 
[01:38:00]  Well, they did clean it, actually.  They did a good sweeping job.  They swept everything.  It was horrible.  They swept right into the cracks.  All right, let's say hi to Ben in New York.  Ben, contractor, Jimmy.  Go ahead, Ben.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Jimmy.  Hi, Angel.  There's a special attachment that the guy's supposed to buy for your shop vac.  It's a wet floor vac attachment, and that sucks all the stuff out of there.  Will it work if it's in between the loose?  Absolutely, because it's made to suck up water, so it's got like a rubber pad along the whole edge of it. 
[01:38:30]  But it's pretty strong suction?  Oh, absolutely.  But, you know, they're supposed to put down brown craft paper down first underneath the drop cloths.  That way nothing gets through.  They didn't even put drop cloths down.  They put brown paper where they're going to be walking, and that was it.  They had it down the first day, and they took it up.  Oh, no, no, no.  When I'm on a job, I keep that stuff down the whole time until we walk out of there, and then we're done.  Then you pull the brown paper up.  You pull the drop cloths up, and then there's nothing left, man.  No damage.  You know what I did once?  Really bad.  I was working on a house. 
[01:39:00]  It's brand-new construction, and my job that day was to put in bathroom exhaust vents, and the spot where they were put in was right over the bathtub.  So I get my little four-foot ladder, I put it in the bathtub, and I take my Makita drill, my cordless drill, put my Phillips head attachment in the drill,  because I'm using Phillips head screws, putting the grills up for the vent.  Pop it up there.  The drill slips out of my hand. 
[01:39:30]  I watch it fall in slow motion and spin, and the Phillips head goes, boonk, right into the bathtub and makes a hole.  It's just stuck there.  It's stuck in the bottom of the bathtub.  Oh, no.  A perfectly round hole.  It's a tough one to cover.  Oh, it is.  It's impossible.  There's the grill right above the hole.  They know who's putting the grills in.  So did you just put a rubber ducky over the hole and hope no one noticed until they moved in?  I did what I was supposed to have done beforehand, which is take a cardboard box and put it in the bathtub. 
[01:40:00]  So if anything falls, it hits the very thick cardboard.  And did that and just left.  And I actually took the grill out so it looked like I hadn't gotten there yet.  Oh, my God.  Whoever's listening right now, if you wonder why your baths have been lasting for eight minutes.  Your downstairs neighbor is complaining all the time.  He has an umbrella in his living room.  You can thank the professor.  Martin in New York. 
[01:40:30]  I know what the problem is, Jimmy.  What, buddy?  You should have got him the right breakfast.  You didn't get him the garlic bagel.  You left the cream cheese at the diner.  Okay.  What are you, the caller that breaks my heart guy?  Breaks my heart.  Speaking of which, we have a guy that's trying out to be a new character on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Dave in Boston.  Hey, Norton.  Yes, Dave?  Homina, homina, homina. 
[01:41:00]  I'm the guy you blew last night at the rest stop guy.  That would be, if that was true, you would just say, hi, this is Frank.  All right.  Where are we with the big A?  Is he practicing his karaoke song?  I hope so.  All right.  And he's doing the Farner song?  Yeah, that would be great.  That's good.  That might be the showstopper today.  You know, it would be the real comedy if he came in and did a dead-on perfect job. 
[01:41:30]  I know.  It sounded beautiful.  I know.  Especially if he was doing it like karaoke in Aruba and he was singing it to a young honor student.  Is that what she was doing?  Karaoke?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to be going to that bar next April.  Going on another cruise down Aruba.  April?  Yeah.  I think March.  March.  And, yeah, come with us.  And we're going down to Aruba.  It's one of the stops.  And that famous bar down there. 
[01:42:00]  Going to drop in there.  I'm saying Cuts Like a Knife or something?  Yeah, do a little karaoke.  Yeah.  See if we can't murder a blonde girl.  You know, I want a date.  I'm going to a play next week.  My first play.  My first Broadway play ever.  No, stop it.  Ever.  Let me think what you're saying.  Let me imagine.  Was this your decision?  Yes, I requested it.  The show was your decision.  Okay.  I don't know of any Black Sabbath or Ozzy musicals that are on Broadway, so that's out.  I'm going to go with Moving Out.  What's that?  Billy Joel's thing? 
[01:42:30]  The Billy Joel musical?  No.  Is it a musical?  No.  Okay.  It's not a musical.  Okay.  That only leaves.  I would never go to a musical.  Unless the chick with me was really hot.  New show?  Hasn't been there that long.  Hasn't been there that long.  Is it on Broadway or off Broadway?  45th Street.  It's on Broadway.  Okay.  It's a Broadway show.  One of the big theaters?  Yeah.  All right.  One of the big theaters.  I know Steve C. would know.  He knows all the shows.  He's going to see.  Freaking fag. 
[01:43:00]  No.  Wow.  I can't think of anything aside from stupid musicals.  The Phantom of the Opera?  Yes.  That's not a musical, is it?  No.  It's a dramedy.  All right.  Who's in it?  Jeffrey Tambor.  Oh.  Oh.  Jeffrey Tambor.  Who the fuck's Jeffrey Tambor?  Tom Wopat.  Oh.  Tom Wopat.  Wait.  Didn't he do a musical?  He did a musical.  It was on Larry Sanders.  Tom Wopat did...  Danny Gets Your Gun.  Danny Gets Your Gun or something.  And Dukes of Hazzard.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  And he was in Dukes of Hazzard.  And Alan Alda.  And Alan Alda?  Alan Alda.  That takes musical right out of it.  Of course.  One of my boyhood heroes.  And you're taking a date?  I don't have a date.  Who am I going to...  No.  Are you sitting alone in a seat on Broadway?  I know a guy.  Oh, my God.  He's a pornographer.  But he owns...  But he has a lot...  He owns Broadway theaters.  Yeah.  And this is not his, but he's going to call the guy.  I'm going to try to pay for the tickets, but he's going to try to get me really great seats. 
[01:44:00]  Which is fine.  It's all I want in a photo with Alan Alda.  I've been walking...  You understand?  I've been walking by for the last few nights trying to catch the actors coming in and out.  Ever since I bothered Jeff Goldblum for a picture the other day, I've been trying to get Alan Alda.  I've been trying to catch him coming in and out.  At the stage door, eagerly awaiting him coming out.  Absolutely.  You're one of those guys?  I never was, but now that I...  With your playbill.  Playbill.  And a pen.  Yes.  A marker waiting.  All right.  Why don't we move on with...  I want to know what the show is.  Well, I thought we'd just let it hang there for a little bit.  That's horrible. 
[01:44:30]  I want a pretty girl.  You want a pretty gal to go with you?  Take my picture.  Do you have two tickets?  If I want them, yes.  Oh.  I can get one or two.  I just have to get two.  I just hope.  You have to.  I'm obsessed with Alabama.  Can we get a date from Alabama for you?  I don't care.  Why would you give it away?  Oh.  It's an awful show.  No.  You want us to give it away?  You can.  I don't care.  Excuse me.  Glenn Gary revival.  Glenn Gary?  Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  That was a great film with...  You saw the movie with Pacino and Jack Lemmon and Kevin Spacey?  A Broadway play?  That's what a play should be.  It's all dialogue.  Yeah.  It's a mammoth writing.  Oh, dude.  That's going to be great.  Alan Alden and Shelley.  It's going to be phenomenal.  I hope you enjoy it.  Oh, I love it.  Because that's what a Broadway play should be.  It's all a bunch of just, you know, actors talking.  All right, guys.  I can't do it.  You've got girls all the time hanging around you, and you can't find one to go.  So warm and true.  Oh. 
[01:45:30]  I need to know you feel it too.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Tell me if I'm coming on too strong.  He doesn't know who I'm listening to, by the way.  He has no idea.  No clue.  This is a big A.  This time I want to be sure.  Been waiting for a girl like you come into my life. 
[01:46:00]  You're falling off the beat a little bit.  Been waiting.  You're falling off the beat a little bit.  You're falling off the beat.  Jesus, Steve.  We will survive.  Been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive.  Waiting?  Yeah.  Waiting for a girl to come into my life.  Oh, you got me, man.  All right. 
[01:46:30]  Try to stay on the beat.  Okay.  It's so funny to listen without the music, because he has the music coming through his headphones.  This is Steve's studio, by the way.  People who are listening, he's not in here.  When we make love, it's understood.  Understood.  You're not going to leave alive.  More than a thought or word can say.  Only in dreams could it be this way.  When you love someone. 
[01:47:00]  What?  I didn't hear you.  Yeah, I really love someone.  Now I know it's right.  From the moment I wake up, deep in the night, nowhere on earth I'd rather be.  Holding you tenderly, I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life. 
[01:47:30]  My trap.  I've been waiting for a girl like you to use my night vision goggles on.  Loving will survive.  I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive.  Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, is that great?  Yeah, all right.  Can't wait to hear it with the music.  It's amazing.  Waiting.  He sings exactly like he should sing.  Of course.  There's no difference there.  Let's be honest.  We were all kind of thinking there might be some gross burger from Stir Crazy type twist.  Something like that.  Maybe Gomer Pile.  Yeah, singing Oh My Papa with a mule by his face.  Jim Neighbors.  Jim Neighbors. 
[01:48:30]  Shit dick.  Oh my home.  All right, you guys ready for some news teases?  We love the news teases.  Oh, yeah.  Still trying to get the rest of the country involved in this bit, but Steve gets frustrated  every day.  He goes through his email.  People don't get the concept.  And basically, Steve starts screaming in the office, these people don't get it.  The listeners do not get it.  They're sending me things I don't need.  Ooh.  Yeah, he did.  Wow, that was good.  I was afraid.  And he hates the listeners. 
[01:49:00]  Steve hates you guys.  Yeah, please.  Absolutely.  Doesn't even fake it.  He hates you guys.  And he gets very frustrated when he opens his email every day, every morning.  Why would you send me this?  What am I supposed to do with this?  I can't mix it.  I can't do anything.  Baby shorts.  Well, we're just looking for the fear in your local news.  That's all.  The fear.  Yeah.  News teases that have fear involved.  Fear.  And not legitimate fear.  Don't send us things about a fire in a building and a fire department had to go in and rescue people that were in danger. 
[01:49:30]  That's a real news story.  That should be scary.  We want stupid things that the news conjures up to scare you with everyday ordinary things or items that happen or you come across on a daily basis that are not scary at all.  But the news just scares you with them.  Well, our gang, you know, they get it.  And they got a bunch of examples here.  I think Danny is spearheading this bit, Anthony.  We like to do it from time to time.  So here's the latest installment of news teases where they try to scare the shit out of you to make you watch the news, basically. 
[01:50:00]  Yep.  Here's the first one.  And keeping summer fun safe.  What you need to hear before letting your child back in the pool.  What?  You need to put the kids going in the pool?  Right.  Right now?  What do I do?  You should have Motley Crue music playing in the back.  Oh, there you go.  Your pool's not safe.  Tommy Lee.  And they'll eventually tell you why.  Stay on the swing set, kids. 
[01:50:30]  Tommy's house.  Here's another example.  Tomorrow at 5, from your microwave to your dryer, hidden dangers in household appliances you use every day.  What you should know.  Come on up on Fox 5 News at 5.  Hidden dangers.  Oh, you despicable asses.  With the guy with the voice.  Microwaves to your dryer.  It's like everything.  From the microwave to your dryer and everything in between.  Here it is.  Danger.  Look out.  Live in a teepee. 
[01:51:00]  Let's say hi to Denise in New Jersey.  Denise?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  What's up?  Hello.  A week ago or two weeks ago, our local news station was broadcasting about a tornado warning.  And all of a sudden they say, if you live in Burlington County, go in your basement right now.  There's a tornado.  There's a tornado.  Go in your basement right now.  But turn up the volume really loud so you can hear what's going on.  We barely got lightning or a gust of wind.  And we sat in our basement for like half an hour.  There you have it. 
[01:51:30]  Perfect example.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good weekend.  All right, Denise.  Thank you.  What's wrong yet?  I don't know.  Well, that sounds kind of legit, too.  You can't tell exactly where tornadoes are going to be.  What's the scream, get in your basement now on the news?  I don't know.  That's kind of legit.  That's a lot of fear.  Where did she live?  In Jersey somewhere.  Jersey?  Yeah.  All right.  That's silly.  They get the occasional tornado.  They've gotten some, believe it or not.  Tornado alley there in Newark.  Oh.  Newark.  All right.  Here we go.  Another news tease to scare the crap out of you. 
[01:52:00]  Are thousands living next to a ticking time bomb ready to send a toxic cloud into the air?  What?  I don't know, Chuck.  A toxic cloud is going to...  They don't even narrow it down, these scumbags.  It might be a legitimate thing, but they don't narrow it down to the actual town or the actual area.  What do we do?  Listen.  Are thousands living next to a ticking time bomb ready to send a toxic cloud into the air?  You son of a bitch.  See, this is what they do. 
[01:52:30]  It's probably legitimate, but they say are thousands.  So you're just watching from home, and you're like, well, is it my area?  He didn't even say thousands are living near a ticking time bomb.  He said are thousands living near a ticking time bomb.  Right.  Is that necessary?  All these bastards.  Every one of these I hear makes me hate them more and more.  We just have to continue our assault on the media.  Just, just tie these people up. 
[01:53:00]  Well, we've been successful this month already.  Yes, we have.  Okay.  Back it up a little bit.  Steve's back.  Yeah, we're going back into Steve's studio.  I'll play a different song.  The big A is doing karaoke.  He's practicing his own songs.  You're going to hear yourself a little bit, and you're going to kick him.  Okay.  All right.  I think he's going to sing, what, Brown Eyed Girl?  Tell Steve not to talk, because we get clean audio that way of the entire song.  No, he's doing all right.  He's being quiet for the most part.  I don't.  I just love hearing Steve, because he gets so frustrated. 
[01:53:30]  It's so warm and true.  I need to know if you feel it, too.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Would you tell me if I'm coming on too strong?  I was waiting for a girl.  This heart of mine has been hurt before.  This time I want to be sure.  Waiting.  Okay, wait, wait.  Now, let's check out how he does the chorus. 
[01:54:00]  Check out how he does the chorus.  Oh, they're listening back to the actual song.  All right.  They're working it.  Okay.  Waiting.  Well, big A will do Waiting for a Girl Like You live on our show in a little while here.  Back to the news teaser.  So you hate them, Anthony, right?  Oh, who doesn't?  The Toxic Cloud.  Let me listen to that one again.  Toxic Cloud.  Toxic Cloud.  Are thousands living next to a ticking time bomb ready to send a toxic cloud into the air?  Isn't that amazing?  I'd like to set fire to his wig.  Isn't that amazing?  All right.  Here's another one, Ant. 
[01:54:30]  And cigarettes and soda.  While your soft drink may soon come with a health warning.  We're not even safe from soda!  To soda!  To soda.  Will your soft drinks now come with a health warning?  We're not even safe from soda.  Soda.  The danger of a can of soda.  Oh, no.  Do you still think the...  Or pop, as they call it in some places around the country.  They're disgraceful. 
[01:55:00]  Soda.  They take no responsibility for what they do.  None!  And then they tell the story and it goes away forever.  And you'll never hear them talk about the danger and warning label on a soda again.  It's just...  It's the scare tactic of the day.  And forget dropping your kids at the mall for a few hours.  You may have to hang out with them.  What?  Why?  Who?  A mall? 
[01:55:30]  You gotta hang out with your kids at the...  We might as well just kill ourselves now.  Despicable.  Just blurting these things out.  How would...  You know, I would love to just walk around the street every day  and just get in individuals' faces and go,  Walking!  Could it kill you?  Just...  What's the difference?  They're just scaring people.  They're blurting out these fear things right in your face every night when you watch TV. 
[01:56:00]  Just walk up to people.  Is a common item in your pocket deadly?  They'd be like,  What?  And then walk away.  It's the same thing these idiots are doing.  And they do it under the guise of impartial and real journalism.  And it's not...  It is...  It's tabloid shit.  This is helping you.  And then they get really mad at us when we disrupt their newscasts.  Yeah, don't...  We're doing a real job.  Yeah.  We're informing the public.  How dare they interrupt his report on a subway rape? 
[01:56:30]  Like the guy who was saying something about a night.  They got a sharp reaction.  Yeah.  Really?  That's the way Cronkite would have done it?  Right.  With a cute little line.  That's kind of cute, right?  Right, Hawk?  Kind of cute.  He still likes his mayonnaise, I'm noticing.  Did you just suck mayo out again?  Because if you did, I'm going to throw a CD at your chin.  Right on my own.  All right, anyway.  He's enjoying his little sandwich.  What do your dumps look like? 
[01:57:00]  I have to ask.  They're fine.  No problem.  Are they really big, solid ones?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe the mayo.  Because mayo is never known to go bad.  You know?  If you eat like crap, you crap nicely.  Thank you.  I got to disagree.  I'm telling you.  Because I eat ridiculously healthy, and that's the problem.  No.  You're binding yourself up with ridiculous stuff.  You've got to get the greasy burgers in you, and the fries, and the mayo.  All that stuff helps that stuff slide out.  But they're not healthy, dude.  When I eat McDonald's, my dumps, it looks like a cliff collapse. 
[01:57:30]  It's like a California mudslide.  That's hilarious.  Whips the houses in debris.  That's what I'm saying.  A little helicopter flying over my toilet.  Looking for survivors?  Oh, God, that's funny.  Horrid.  All right, back to the scary news teases.  Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.  Lost, there's a sunblock out there that's better than the rest.  But protecting your skin could mean breaking the law. 
[01:58:00]  Wow.  Wait.  I want to cry.  Look, I'm absolutely crying.  I can't deal with these.  What did that mean?  If you use sunscreen, you're getting arrested?  What?  Well, there's, I guess, a tanning lotion out there that really protects your skin, but you  would be breaking the law.  It's called heroin?  Are they rubbing sunblock?  Sorry, go ahead.  They're rubbing crack or something on themselves? 
[01:58:30]  How is it?  I'm hyperventilating.  You can only get it from the brain stem of a baby.  Rub it on.  That's good.  Let's say hi to Stephen Rockland.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  I actually saw that newscast about the soda.  Oh.  And you know what it was?  They wanted to tell you that sugar was bad for you, can make you fat and rot your teeth.  So there's somebody that wants a warning label on that.  They want to put a warning label on soda cans that sugar can make you fat and rot your teeth. 
[01:59:00]  And these scumbag tabloid zeros tied it into cigarettes because of a warning label.  I'm guessing, is that the tie-in with cigarettes with warning label, warning label?  You got to think, right?  Oh, he left.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, we got rid of him.  Plus, there's a sunblock out there that's better than the rest, but protecting your skin  could mean breaking the law.  Breaking the law?  What the?  What?  I don't.  I'm flabbergasted. 
[01:59:30]  This assault on the media thing we do is going to just get bigger and bigger and bigger and  bigger and bigger and bigger.  I'm just trying to not get burned.  Oh, I know how it is.  There's alcohol in the suntan lotion, but it only works if you're drinking it and driving  55 miles an hour in a 30 zone.  Oh.  All right.  And the guy saw the mall story.  I want to hear the sunblock story, though.  I got to know what that is. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Let's go to Alex in Rockland.  Alex.  Alex.  What up, Opie?  What's up?  Anthony, what's up, Norman?  All right.  What do you got, bro?  They're talking about in Poughkeepsie, how kids under 18, they're now on the mall, at the  four o'clock.  Because they want to protect the store owners.  Either just hanging out there and just whatever.  Well, the problem is kids have nowhere to hang out, so they, you know, hang out in packs  at the malls.  Right.  Not white kids, though.  They're okay.  Oh, that's what they were talking about. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  And the sunblock.  Yeah.  They were talking about how the sunblock comes from Europe and it's not legal over here.  Yeah.  Why?  Because there's a special ingredient in it?  Yeah.  It's illegal over here, so if you order it, what, on the internet?  We got another guy.  Sal in Huntington.  Go ahead, Sal.  What's up, boys?  Hi.  Yeah, the sunblock stupid thing.  Yeah.  The FDA banned it in the United States because of some drug that's in it, and they let you 
[02:01:00]  use it in the UK.  But in the United States, they won't let you use it.  So now it's a big thing on the fucking internet.  Oh, everybody can get this on the internet, but you can't get it in the United States,  so it's against the law.  But you can get it anyway, but you're not getting arrested for it or...  Right.  Yeah.  Fucking ridiculous.  Like there's sunblock police out there.  Yeah.  That's right.  You're slathering that on and bust you.  You've done a good job, boys.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Neil in New Jersey.  Neil, what's up?  I just wanted to let you know that look at the piece of shit broadcast that you're talking 
[02:01:30]  about.  Fox 5.  It's like the bottom fucking of the barrel.  They're all the same, though.  What would you say, ABC and ABC?  Of course, they're all.  P-shit.  Chuck Scarborough, they all do it.  Fox 5 is like almost the bottom next to UPN 9.  Yeah, well, those are probably the worst, but we had Chuck Scarborough, and he's on what,  Channel 4 or something.  I mean, we have a...  You know, these examples come from all different sources. 
[02:02:00]  They're all doing it.  Chuck from Olympia, Washington makes a good point, too, when they show the other side  of the media, fear-mongering, where they say something like, new treatment may cure Parkinson's,  and they get you all excited or something like that.  Cure for cancer right around the corner?  We'll talk to this doctor.  And how long have you heard all those stories?  Right.  That's another way of getting...  They either scare the shit out of you, or get your hopes up.  The cure for Parkinson's is actually a 90-pound lead hat. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, shit.  We're going to miss you when you go to Hollywood, Jimmy.  Oh, does that conjure up an image?  All right.  There's somebody somewhere going, that may just work. 
[02:03:00]  He's slumped in a chair, a little too heavy to move.  How do you do?  I tip my hat, but...  Pop, pop, where's your lead gloves?  They hurt.  Lead.  Jesus.  All right, here we go.  Another news tease, Ant.  Pop, just getting started.  Imagine going for a walk with your dog and wondering if you'd make it home alive.  Wow.  I can't even do this bit anymore. 
[02:03:30]  It can't be real.  I can't do this anymore.  What is that story?  This is comedy stuff.  When they say that, the only time that's legitimate is if it's a picture of a white person with a  poodle at 145th Street.  Just getting started.  Imagine going for a walk with your dog and wondering if you'd make it home alive.  What could that be about?  I'd walk my dog.  Isn't that every person that leaves the house ever?  Ever.  Don't you always wonder if you're going to make it home alive?  Sure.  I'm stunned. 
[02:04:00]  I'm stupefied.  I think I would be immune to these by now, but no.  No.  Please keep sending these in, guys.  Please.  Please, please, please.  It just justifies anything we do to these people out on the street.  It's a justification for everything.  They always get it wrong, too.  Always get it wrong.  They always get the facts wrong.  They're not what they used to be in the 60s and whatever, 70s, when they were actually 
[02:04:30]  just guys doing the news legitimately.  So the assault on the media will continue with your Opie and Anthony signs, your XM satellite  radio signs.  It's good exposure for our program, obviously, as we spread the virus here.  And every month, we give you a prize for the best assault on the media, Anthony.  Yes, we do.  For the month of July, it's a my-fi and a day in the studio with the show.  And right now, we've got Steve from Boston and Paul from Buffalo.  Right.  They're in contention.  But, you know, someone else might do one, who knows, today or over the weekend that might  blow those guys away. 
[02:05:00]  You never know.  Instant feedback.  A 90-pound lead hat.  The greatest line ever spoken by a comedian ever.  Thank you.  From Mr. and Mrs. N, South Jersey.  That really is an amazing line.  Thank you.  All right, here we go.  The last tease for this segment, Anthony.  All right.  We'll do this again maybe next week or something.  You won't believe the warning that could be on the next can of soda you drank. 
[02:05:30]  Then, one city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  Come on.  I thought we were just going to get the soda can one again.  Oh, of course not.  You've got to end with a good one, man.  A three-block area of sex offenders in your neighborhood.  Wow.  Just whacking and jacking.  Oh, that's just the best image.  Just, yeah, sitting on their porch, just jerking off to young children. 
[02:06:00]  Just passing porn off to each other over and over again.  Right in your neighborhood.  Everyone's fighting to open their own trench coat store.  That is such a phony story.  That is not happening.  That would never happen.  They're not packing sex offenders into a three-block area in your neighborhood.  It is not happening ever.  And you're the lucky fellow that's the house right next to that?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Can I borrow a cup of your daughter's piss? 
[02:06:30]  Hi, neighbor.  Howdy, neighbor.  Oh, he comes to bring you a cake and a box, but he's holding it at waist level.  He's encouraging you to reach your hand into it.  Howdy, neighbor.  Oh.  Oh.  Little raccoon traps on their front lawn with Barbie dolls in them.  Every house for three blocks has a little puppy in a room with no windows. 
[02:07:00]  The door's always open, and it says I can come in and pet him.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Three blocks of sex offenders.  Dumbest.  I've got to hear it again.  You won't believe the warning that could be on the next can of soda you drank.  Then, one city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  Could be.  It could be right next to your house. 
[02:07:30]  There's this one guy out there that has the sucks to be you.  Oh.  Right where the three blocks cut off, and it turns into a nice suburban neighborhood.  You're that guy.  You're trying to wave at your new neighbors, and you just see a whole block of them with  their dicks out, just staring at you.  Oh.  You've got to build a moat around your house.  What would you do?  Just eat a moat.  Oh, that's great.  Find a dragon. 
[02:08:00]  Three blocks.  God.  You have to fatten your kids up real quick so they're not so attractive.  Ugly children.  Or dress them in old Victorian clothing.  Cake for breakfast again, Mom?  No more running through the sprinkler.  We'll do that in the living room.  Your 14-year-old daughter washing her face with Crisco.  You bring home mean dogs to bite your kids who don't have the urge to pet them when a 
[02:08:30]  man goes, psst.  It's just horrid.  It's not happening.  How do they get away with that kind of fear-mongering?  That is such a never, ever going to materialize situation.  Do you think any town in their right mind would accept three square blocks of sex offenders 
[02:09:00]  anywhere?  You won't believe the warning that could be on the next can of soda you drank.  Then one city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  That could be the...  We've got to play that a hundred more times.  They kept us in a fun area.  Someone mentioned that on Instant Feedback.  Like the sex offender ghetto.  Like Poland.  You've got to see one pervert with a red dress running through the entire...  Horrible. 
[02:09:30]  Horrible fear-mongering.  I'm essential to Nambula.  I could have just jerked off one more.  Just one more cock I could have grabbed and tugged.  I raped a bunch of people.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  Wow, that is...  Where was that, by the way?  Did they say where it was? 
[02:10:00]  That's a big laugh.  I've got to know.  I've got to put mousetraps in your daughter's panties.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Connecticut.  It might be in Connecticut.  Charlie!  Oh, hey, Jimmy.  What's going on?  How's the chocolate factory?  It's fucking great.  Where is this fun town?  We do this shit all the time with sex offenders.  It's called a fucking prison.  Punch it up.  Oh, I thought he had info.  We need info.  We need info.  It would have been funny if you said it was Chelsea, because that's like a three-block radius. 
[02:10:30]  Let's say hi to James.  James?  Hey, guys.  I was wondering if you saw last night on the Daily Show, they did the Harry Potter, how  it was released in Canada early, and they did this huge spoof about how could it happen  in your neighborhood, or here, or here, or here, and it was right on.  It was exactly what you guys were talking about, and even they were noticing on there,  and it was hilarious.  I'm a little suspicious about the Daily Show.  I hear they've been doing... 
[02:11:00]  A little suspicious.  I know this is not the most original bit, but I'm very suspicious, because we've been  pounding this one hard.  Well, that's what I thought.  It was sounding just like yours, and they just made this spoof up, but it was kind of  funny, and then you guys did Harry Potter and this today, so I thought, well, I've got  to say something about this.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Oh, and one thing.  Jimmy, Never Do the Odeon is the worst venue in Cleveland.  I've done it twice already, bro.  I've done a bunch of shows there.  Yeah.  I went to one of your shows at the Odeon.  I love that place.  It is a sweat shop. 
[02:11:30]  It is the hottest place.  You can't get drinks.  You can't get service.  It is awful.  All right.  Good.  So any tickets that are remaining for the second show?  Thanks for the help, fellas.  Appreciate that.  You're a true fan of the program, sir.  No, I've actually...  I don't live in Cleveland anymore.  I don't care.  I'll see you when you come to Charlotte.  You need to come down here.  I only do, again, sitting shows there, so it's not going to be mobbed in a high-up.  That'd be better.  That's better.  Honestly, you know, I was there for the Norton shows.  It was great.  It really was great.  Instant feedback coming in.  I can't wait to go to the summer block party at Norton Estates Sex Offender Village. 
[02:12:00]  Norton Estates.  Oh, that is...  Yeah, how do the realtors handle that when they're trying to sell the houses around that neighborhood?  It's BYOV.  You bring your own victim.  It's not happening.  Oh, God.  That's...  A town wants to do this?  Like, that's what...  Now I gotta...  I want to hear every word of it.  That's priceless.  Do you have it still?  You want me to play it again?  Oh, you just gotta leave that in the machine all day long.  That is...  Cut out the soda part for later, and I want that on my machine. 
[02:12:30]  This thing just writes itself.  I love bits that just write themselves.  You won't believe the warning that could be on the next can of soda you drank.  Then, one city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  What city, whore?  What city?  What neighborhood?  It's a three-block area, but it could be next to your house.  You know how big of an area that covers? 
[02:13:00]  What city?  Yeah, where?  What city?  What city?  Who's thinking of doing this?  Show me the politician that launched this idea.  You have to, like, look at their broadcast radius, and then stand there like stupid Rocky  Dennis, and...  Except you're putting little pins in the map shaped like Flintstones Chewables.  Oh, yeah, Halloween must be a real treat in that neighborhood.  Trick or...  In other news, 400 children turned up missing. 
[02:13:30]  A bunch of bloody Darth Vader costumes were found in a dumpster.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Oh.  Holy shit.  Figure out creative ways to stick your cock through the bottom of the bowl full of that candy corn.  Grab a handful, kids.  Put your hands behind your back and bob for candy.  Ha ha ha! 
[02:14:00]  We might have more info on the story.  Andy.  Yeah.  What's up, Andy?  Yeah, they're trying to put the facility in Valhalla.  They're closing the one in Armonk and putting the one in between two children's hospitals.  No, it's a three-block area.  Yeah, we still don't know.  It's not the same story.  I don't know where there's a county jail.  Wait, someone is saying it's in Ohio?  Chris, go ahead, Chris. 
[02:14:30]  What's that?  What?  What is it?  Yeah, it's Wilmington, Ohio.  They just put notices on all the sex offenders' addresses, houses, and they got a three-block  radius set up where they can live at.  All right, we're going to find this out.  You're saying Wilmington, Ohio.  Yeah, Wilmington, Ohio.  All right.  They just started doing it here the last few weeks.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:00]  Wow.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  That's just...  That's ridiculous.  All right, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  All right.  We'll find out more about this story.  Yeah.  I'm going to do research.  That's right.  I'm going to call you all.  You all.  We got the big A hanging with us all morning long.  He's going to come back in the studio and do news, Andrew, with the speech impediment.  Yeah.  And he's also going to do karaoke, Waiting for a Girl Like You.  And as we go to break, in honor of having Andrew in all day, we got this song from Stephen 
[02:15:30]  Lynch.  I'll do this one.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very special friend.  Ed was kind, but just a little different, oh, special Ed.  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head. 
[02:16:00]  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special, just a little bit special.  We'd play tag, and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier, he'd eat dirt.  I like math and the spelling bee.  It's like talking to a tree. 
[02:16:30]  He'd be your special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed.  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls, Ed ran headfirst in two walls. 
[02:17:00]  I had girly girls and lots of clothes, Ed had names for all his toes.  Like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Bobby and Ricky and Mike.  And if I love the girl, who cares who you like, and special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special. 
[02:17:30]  I thought college life was great.  It could count from one to two.  I like people and the party scene.  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner specialist.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head. 
[02:18:00]  Now his favorite color is the radio.  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit.  One day talking to special Ed.  He grabbed a brick and he swung at my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew.  That special Ed just made me special too. 
[02:18:30]  Ha!  My shoes hurt!  Now I laugh as I count bugs.  I give strangers great big hugs.  Next to me, it is fine.  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein.  Oh, special Ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head, you see. 
[02:19:00]  Now we're not so, not so bright.  Instead, we're a little bit special.  Oh, just a little bit special.  Oh, that fuck red made me special.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit special.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today? 
[02:19:30]  Cancel all the appointments.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin.  Shh, fix it, fix it, fix it. 
[02:20:00]  Guess who's back?  I'm over here now.  Back looking.  Nice head, dick.  Bag.  Bag it.  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  Back looking.  I don't believe it.  Don't burn your soul.  Don't burn.  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Back looking.  Guess who's back?  Tell her, Frank.  Good luck.  Guess who's back?  Hey!  Guess who's back? 
[02:20:30]  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Turn it off!  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jamming up right now.  What the hell's that doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little woman today.  Because it feels so gay without me.  I'm saying this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little woman today.  We're going to feel so empty without me. 
[02:21:00]  Okay, caught.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  We're getting ready for Andrew to do more news for us. 
[02:21:30]  And then he's going to croon.  And then he's going to sing some karaoke.  There's a little mouth for a big man.  The look he gives is really, really creepy, man.  And then he laughs, and then it's all good.  Anthony, you know a little more about that sex offender story?  Yeah, from what I can gather, it's not that they're looking to round up sex offenders and put them in a three-block area. 
[02:22:00]  From what I can see from the story here, they want to ban sex offenders from being anywhere near where children can gather.  And they want to increase those areas to, well, they already have, you know, schools, bus stops, daycare centers, but they also want playgrounds, parks, and all kinds of other areas where kids might be, which would cut down the areas that they're able to live.  They probably looked at this town, saw that there's a school here, here, here, this eliminates this area, this, this, this, and were probably left over with three blocks of area in this town if you included every place that they want to prohibit sex offenders from living by. 
[02:22:30]  Not, here's a three-block concentration camp of sex offenders that were going to lump into this area, but the way they made it sound was, here's three square blocks near your neighborhood, going to be full of sex offenders.  You mean they probably took the total area and did some math and realized it was about this area?  Right, did some math, realized there's only so much area. 
[02:23:00]  If you take away everything near a school, near a daycare center, near parks, you're going to be left with three square blocks in this town.  Not three blocks, you walk into it and the fun ensues.  A bunch of dopes on the news.  A bunch of dopes.  Scare tactics, come on.  Alright, what's up with the Dukes of Hazzard guy?  Oh, Cooter?  Yeah.  Remember Cooter?  He seems that he's a little bitter.  A little bitter.  Why would Cooter be bitter that he was on a popular show back in the 70s, and when they remake the movie, they didn't ask him to be in it? 
[02:23:30]  Why would that make him bitter?  Cooter was...  Was he the fat guy?  What did he run?  The gas station or something?  He was the mechanic.  I don't know shit about Dukes of Hazzard.  He was the mechanic.  Here's what you need to know.  It stunk.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was the mechanic.  I know the car was called the General Lee.  The General Lee had the big confederate flag on the roof.  Does the car in the movie have the confederate flag on the roof?  Really?  Or did they get PC and not put it on there?  Well, I assume they would get all politically correct and not put it on there. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, well...  Put maybe an African flag or something more inclusive.  Yeah, put something more inclusive on the General Lee, because that's how real Southern people would be.  At least they did it right.  Yeah, really be PC and put a rainbow on it.  Jesus, Jimmy.  What?  And Jimmy goes...  When you hear Jimmy go, ooh, sometimes during the show for no reason, it's because a Pampers commercial comes on TV.  Or one of those underoos or whatever the hell commercial. 
[02:24:30]  You know, I looked up the same time you did.  I thought those were used diapers.  Why?  Because they're all, like, colorful and stuff.  I'm like, what?  You ever see a kid's poop?  It's very colorful.  That'd be a great diaper commercial.  You just pan to a weeping old person.  White shoes sticking straight out.  Just embarrassed.  They've lost control.  I used to work in an office.  All right.  I saved people in the war. 
[02:25:00]  There he is crapping himself.  Waiting there for a good changing.  That's horrid.  A lump of pudding in your underwear.  Yeah, Cooter.  Cooter ran for Congress, I guess, a few years ago in Virginia.  I heard he was a former congressman.  Did he win that?  I have no idea.  But he's all mad.  He says the Dukes of Hazzard TV show was nice, wholesome, family entertainment. 
[02:25:30]  Family entertainment.  And the movie is full of sexual innuendo, dirty jokes, and it is not, and what?  Violence.  And violence, right.  Violence.  And that was never on the Dukes.  Let's go to the clip.  A former star of the 80s TV show Dukes of Hazzard says that the new movie based on the  series is too trashy.  Ben Jones, who played the mechanic Cooter, said the script had too much profanity and 
[02:26:00]  sexual content.  The former Georgia congressman called it an insult to what he believes was a family-friendly  show.  It sounds like Mr. Cooter there didn't get a call for the remake movie thing.  No.  No cameo for him?  Dukes of Hazzard.  I bet you if they called him to be in the movie, he would change his tune, right?  I'm on Internet Movie Database.  I have to find him.  Yeah.  Where's Cooter?  Ben Jones.  Let's see.  Born in 1941. 
[02:26:30]  How old a guy is he?  That would be 50, 60, 60, 60, 60.  62.  62?  So, yeah.  What?  How old?  64.  Is it 64?  Of course.  Yeah.  He's an old curmudgeon now.  The violence.  Doesn't like the violence.  I hear he runs a little museum down there, too.  Got like a Dukes of Hazzard museum.  Makes his money over there.  And they have a whole, every year, they have this Dukes of Hazzard fest where Dukes of 
[02:27:00]  Hazzard fans show up, because some of them dress like the characters, and they have a  General Lee stunt show.  And I'm sure there's no lady showing up for this in their tiny, tiny little Daisy Dukes.  Daisy Dukes.  Because it was a family show.  Right, Cooter?  I'm sure Cooter would tell you that that was, you know, a lot was left to the imagination  back then.  Sure, she wore her Daisy Dukes, but, you know, we never really saw anything.  That offends the Cooter. 
[02:27:30]  Cooter.  Your name's fucking Pussy.  Your name is a slang for Pussy.  You're a twunt.  That's offensive.  He's walking around with his name, might as well be Cunt.  It's Cooter.  All right.  Are we ready for Andrew?  What they should do is they should have this little get-together where all the Dukes of  Hazzard fans show up.  Yeah.  And then people just come in with guns and kill them.  Shoot them all.  In a room.  I think we should just unleash black people on them. 
[02:28:00]  Because I'm sure they have no black people going to the Dukes of Hazzard reunion.  One sellout with really round glasses and perfect white diction.  It's called Cooter's Place.  It's his museum.  Ew.  Do they have memorabilia down there?  Do they have a General Lee also?  Oh, yeah.  Sure they do.  Of course they do.  Cooter's Place.  You walk in like a big pair of panties on the outside.  Cooter.  Look at all the people that show up and they have like a General Lee car show. 
[02:28:30]  So people that have a General Lee car can pull up.  Looks like they have a race.  A General Lee race.  And they have like a weird contest.  Every car has like a rope tied to the back of it with a couple of shoes.  Jesus.  Oh.  All right.  Let's get Andrew in here, guys.  All right.  Did he get his website or no?  He wrote something.  It opened later on his website.  Here he comes into the studio. 
[02:29:00]  The Big A, Andrew.  Our latest creation, Anthony.  A lot of instant feedback coming in.  Oh.  That is.  That's piercing.  That like annoys the crap out of me.  That little whistling song.  It's from Kill Bill.  But.  Oof.  Wow.  Pat from Menachie.  I didn't know he wrote this feedback.  Andrew's a star.  This just in.  Pat from Menachie is on Suicide Watch.  Aw. 
[02:29:30]  Oh.  Can I say something?  No, I'm wondering.  I don't recognize the name.  What?  Oh.  Oh.  Very good.  All right, Andrew.  How are you?  Huh?  Okay.  Okay.  Ah.  We heard you did a pretty good job practicing your Waiting for a Girl Like You song.  I was trying.  Yeah?  How do you think you did?  Not that great.  Not that great?  Not that great?  But you said you did karaoke before. 
[02:30:00]  In a karaoke bar, was it?  We never really got into that.  Or at a party?  Um.  I had a karaoke bar.  Karaoke bar.  And you were there with your friends?  Um.  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  And, uh, what, what, did they put you up to it, or you just figured you'd get up there  and sing a tune?  Because that's kind of a ballsy thing.  A lot of people get scared to get up in front of people, and you seem like a shy guy. 
[02:30:30]  A little shy.  A little shy.  A little shy.  A little shy.  A little shy.  A little shy.  A little shy.  A little shy.  Yeah?  Well, actually, most of the time I do karaoke, you know, of course, in a bar, you know,  you're drinking, and it gives you a little courage.  Ah, that's true.  Very good.  Loosens you up a little bit.  You've got to love alcohol.  Do you talk normal when you're drunk?  Um, a little better.  A little better?  A lot of times.  Wow.  You're not as nervous, right?  Of course not.  We got rid of the Jaeger machine. 
[02:31:00]  No shit.  What, uh...  But I sure enjoy doing a radio show.  Yeah.  What is your favorite song to sing during karaoke?  My Generation by The Who?  Anything by Nell, tell us.  All right.  Actually, I usually sing songs...  Um, there's a singer called Andrew Gold.  Andrew Gold?  Oh, Lonely Boy, right?  Yes.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:31:30]  You know that one?  Dude, I've had to spin this crap.  Are you a lonely boy named Andrew?  That would be a perfect one for him to do.  Is that one?  The next time you come in, Andrew, we'll have you do a Lonely Boy.  We'll get that karaoke.  All right.  Give me a Lonely Boy.  Andrew Gold.  You know the song, right, Dan?  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember how it goes, though.  That's not helping.  I know. 
[02:32:00]  You know the song.  It was a huge hit.  Oh, it's like...  Yeah, could you get the Greg and Tony show thing, too?  People request that.  Please.  All right.  Hit Lonely Boy.  This thing is.  Oh, of course.  You know the word, right?  Yeah.  Right.  You've done this karaoke?  Yeah, I have.  Yeah?  All right, sing along with Andrew Gould there.  He was born on his son of age, 1951. 
[02:32:30]  One.  One.  And with the slap of a hand, he had landed as an only son.  His mother and father said, what a lovely boy.  We'll teach him what we learned, oh, yes, it's just what we learned.  We'll dress him up warmly and we'll send him to school.  It'll teach him how to fight for me.  Do you know this part? 
[02:33:00]  Oh, what a lonely boy.  Oh, what a lonely boy.  What a lonely boy.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  All right.  I've never heard karaoke done like that before.  Vocal stylings.  Where you just kind of choose a word every once in a while.  Andrew was anticipating the word.  Like, they'd go, and a girl.  And he'd go, and boy.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Greatest song ever.  Eric, write a note for yourself.  I want that on my replay.  And I want the other one about, you know, suck my fucking cock.  I'm on that.  Thank you.  All right.  Are you ready for the news, Andrew?  Andrew.  Okay.  More news?  Yeah.  More news with...  Hey, Fez.  The big A.  In our Fez. 
[02:34:00]  Fez.  Fez.  You want to run a Fez?  Hey, Fez.  Hi, Fez.  Hi, Fez.  Fez.  All right.  Whenever you're ready.  I don't think we're going to go with the teletype so we can hear every nuance of your speech impediment.  Go ahead, Andrew.  The big A.  Man, sword, and bombing probe arrested.  Police on fire arrested an Egyptian biochemist who saw it in the probe into the London bombings, 
[02:34:30]  a government official said.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Mag, uh, Magdi, uh, Magdi, uh, Magdi, um, Magdi, uh, Magdi, uh, Magdi El-Nashara  was arrested in Cairo early Friday, an official said.  And was being interrogated by Egyptian authorities.  You're a kid,ハ'am! 
[02:35:00]  Metropolitan Police in London said a man has been arrested in Cairo,  but would not confirm his name or caratize him as a suspect.  Okay, terrific.  Well, what him as a subject?  I didn't hear him struggling. 
[02:35:30]  Caratize.  I didn't hear him.  I know I missed.  No, actually, I didn't hear it.  You turned someone into a carrot.  You caratized them.  Just the last sentence.  I'm sorry.  I actually just missed it because I was...  But would not confirm his name of caratize him.  No, carrotized. 
[02:36:00]  It's the machine bunnies have been working on.  Get me my carrotizer.  I know what the word was.  It was, uh...  Oh, my God.  I'm getting nervous. 
[02:36:30]  This show is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Frickin' grown men.  Part jokes.  Horrid.  Let's say hi to Brian in Alabama.  Brian?  Alabama man!  Alabama man!  Go ahead, Brian.  Hey, yeah, I was just wondering, could somebody take a steak knife and clean my ears out?  This guy here is worse than listening to me on the radio.  I don't think so.  All right.  You're sadly mistaken. 
[02:37:00]  Thank you.  A lot of people saying the Greg and Tony show theme sounds like Andrew.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  Greg and Tony show.  Nice, yes.  All right.  If you will, Andrew.  Good night.  Good night.  Good night.  Good night.  Good night.  Good night.  Good night.  All right.  All right.  On with the news with the Big A.  Another story.  Andrew, what, of Arabia?  All right.  Good night.  Canadian bars and hockey fans ready for a new season. 
[02:37:30]  Bar owners and hockey starved of Canada anticipate a sharp rise in business now that the National 
[02:38:00]  Hockey League seems days away from icing the longest labor spirit in North America professional sports.  The NHL and the union representing its players reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday and are expected to ratify the deal next week.  With a new season beginning in early October. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Cool.  Not bad.  I figured out the fingertips, by the way.  You did?  Yes.  It's Morse code for stop touching me.  Started many, many years ago.  Little feetie pajamas being roughly tugged down.  This is the worst.  The feet kick in.  They still have those little plastic things on the bottom. 
[02:39:00]  Little feetie parts.  Yeah.  For traction.  Shh.  Just keep tapping, boy.  Just keep tapping.  Oh.  Just keep tapping.  What Andrew was trying to say, there's going to be hockey this year.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh.  I got it.  That was a story on the shuttle.  No clue.  All right, Big A.  Let's go.  Tile.  Internet users getting scammed, survey says.  Despite numerous warnings from security firms and financial institutions, 9% of U.S. Internet 
[02:39:30]  users have lost money due to email scams.  According to a recent survey, in a study of 791 users commissioned by Anthony Spam, the firm, Mirror Point. 
[02:40:00]  The group found that the most perceived scams were prescription drug offers, financing services, phishing, emails, and pornographic.  And what? 
[02:40:30]  What?  And pornographic.  Pornographic.  That's terrific.  Pornography.  That's terrific.  Jimmy.  Pornography?  Pornography.  Yeah.  Pornographic-y.  I like pornography.  Pornography is some great stuff.  We all know that.  All right.  Go ahead.  Two St. Louis disc jockeys suspended. 
[02:41:00]  Ooh-hoo.  Two hip-hop radio personalities have been suspended for an unerror discussion of ways to fight police officers.  Comments made not long ago after an officer was slain.  The two suspended disc jockeys whose special names are DJ Chaos and DJ Siley Az were discussing with callers on their morning show how to fight for an officer's radio. 
[02:41:30]  So he or she cannot call for help.  The station said, 
[02:42:00]  Hello!  Exactly!  What were the DJ's names?  I might know those guys from St. Louis.  I think you did their show once, Jimmy.  DJ Chaos and DJ Siley S-Y-L-L-I and the last name is A-S-Z. 
[02:42:30]  All right.  Very good.  So, uh, silly ass.  Some DJ's got suspended for doing something.  All right.  Good.  And Chaos.  Do we have any more there?  No.  Any more stories?  Chaos.  The Greek DJ.  I am Chaos.  Is that it there, Big A?  I have two more.  Oh, two more.  Oh, all right. 
[02:43:00]  Actually, he doesn't have any more.  He was just saying he has a tumor.  It comes out like that.  Oh, very good.  Oh, sports fans.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'll hurt you, Big A.  All right.  Jimmy.  Who's fighting?  Even he's getting in on the ass.  He's trying to fight, Big A.  Well, he knows how to fight back a little bit.  All right.  Go ahead, Big A.  I just did it. 
[02:43:30]  The gas coming out of Jimmy's little A.  Trust me.  It's making the smell in the studio much better.  Oh, God.  Where are you going, little hat?  All right.  Let's go there, Big A.  Hey.  Looking good, sports fans.  Good one.  Yeah.  God, why do you put so many jerks in the world at the same time?  Good ball. 
[02:44:00]  That's great.  All right.  Let's go, Andrew.  Christian Slater turns down a plea deal.  Christian Slater rejected a plea bargain deal from Prosecutors Thursday on a charge of allegedly groping a woman.  Slater was charged with forcible touching after he allegedly walked up behind a woman and grabbed her buttocks. 
[02:44:30]  And she was buying a soda in a small grocery store on Manhattan's Upper East Side in the early morning of May 31st.  I didn't think we were going to get there that time.  Wow.  All right.  And your final story, Andrew?  Housewives fill Emmy void left by absent friends. 
[02:45:00]  The ABC Network's mega hit comedy of suburban shenanigans, Desperate Housewives struck Emmy gold, garnering 15th nominations for U.S. Television's top awards.  The show, which grabbed a global audience in its debut season, shared the series spotlight with NBC's gay-themed sitcom, Will and Grace, which also received 15 nods. 
[02:45:30]  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Okay.  What?  What?  What? 
[02:46:00]  Arr!  Arr!  And that's it with the news, right, Andrew, everyone?  Yeah, another bang-up job, Andrew.  Thank you.  All right, we're going to go to break with the insect song, Anthony, in honor of Andrew hanging with us today.  He's going to sing.  Well, and then, yeah, when we get back, we're going to have Andrew singing, Waiting for a Girl Like You from Foreigner.  I think he's a good, is he a good singer?  Well, singer.  It's not singer.  It is not singer.  It is if you live in, like, you know, very Jewish neighborhoods. 
[02:46:30]  Singer?  He's a good singer.  He's a good singer.  No, it's singer and finger.  Ooh.  I am working on it.  That's right.  I'm going to linger so I can finger a singer.  Yes.  Do you walk around reciting the word over and over again like I do?  I go, don't put your finger in your nose.  But that's what I do now.  I go, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.  All right, here's some retards singing a song. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, that's not nice.  I go, put, put, put, put, put, put, put. 
[02:47:30]  If you accidentally fall in the water, you're in trouble.  Fire is here to have you.  You better watch out or the insides against you.  You better watch out or the insides against you. 
[02:48:00]  You better watch out or the insides against you.  You better watch out or the insides against you.  You better watch out or the insides against you.  You better watch out or the insides against you. 
[02:48:30]  You better watch out or the insides against you.  You better watch out or the insides against you.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar, right, Ramon? 
[02:49:00]  The rich texture, the full flavor, so relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks, no ashtray.  Ramon, open your mouth.  All right, so are we going to fix the... 
[02:49:30]  Is there a space shuttle there, Anthony? 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  It's looking like they're going to be putting this thing off until September.  Do you think after two years they'd have it all figured out?  That's true.  That it would be just flawless, you know?  You would think.  But then it's some dumb thing again.  It's a real dumb thing.  Some kind of fuel sensor that was telling Mission Control that their fuel tank was empty when it was really full.  Yeah.  And if the ship gets a reading that that tank is empty, it shuts the engines down. 
[02:50:30]  Which, you know, that could be a little tragic for engines to shut down.  As you're taking off, yeah.  Yeah.  It could be a little dangerous.  So, they said they don't know what it is, though.  They've replaced the entire system.  The sensor, the wires that go to the sensor, where those wires go.  Like, the entire thing was taken out and replaced.  And they still have the problem.  It's one of those things that they call a gremlin in the system.  Just unplug the goddamn thing.  They can't figure it out. 
[02:51:00]  And they only have certain launch windows.  And I guess if they miss the next one on Sunday, they've got to wait quite a while.  So, they're scrambling.  They're hoping to fix it in time, right?  Aaron from Indiana.  He wants Andrew to sing My Sharona.  It's not much of an SH problem.  I'm just a stuttering thing.  Yeah.  And Brian from Manhattan, you guys are in second place on XMVote.com for the best DJ show on XM. 
[02:51:30]  Tell the Pest to vote for O&A a thousand times.  Damn that, Bruce Kelly.  Who's the best?  Who's winning?  I would assume Bruce Kelly.  Best DJ.  No idea.  Who knows?  Who cares?  Let's say hi to Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right.  Is Andrew still there?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Andrew.  You're a little nervous, huh?  Yeah.  A little bit.  I think you would also, so.  Hey, you know what?  I just wanted to say, I got a rod in my pants. 
[02:52:00]  I wanted to know if Andrew could read from Red Boys.  A lot of people are requesting this, actually.  They really are.  I thought of it, too, but I just, I know you want to, you said you want to keep the sexy  out of the show.  Randy Rhoads is beating us.  Top 10 shows DJs on XM.  Oh.  There's only, there's only, we got 27 votes, she's got 36.  That's it?  It's not even a real poll.  Not a vote.  We probably announced it.  Where, where's this vote, Eric? 
[02:52:30]  Bruce Kelly has 12 votes.  XMvote.com.  I say we, we put Bruce Kelly over the top.  Fuck us.  Oh, yeah.  Make Bruce Kelly number one, everybody.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's what we do now.  You could do that in two minutes.  I don't like Randy Rhoads ever since she was killed in 82 in that Florida plane crash.  Top 10 favorite channels on XM.  I mean, first place, High Voltage.  Second place, Fred.  Third place, The 60s Channel.  Fourth place, Real Jazz.  And fifth place, XM Comedy. 
[02:53:00]  Please, let's put Bruce Kelly over the top.  Yeah, don't put us over the top, people.  Bruce Kelly.  It's all about Bruce Kelly.  Bruce and his huge hog that we saw yesterday.  And second place, he's an abomination in the front of his pants.  All right, so maybe Andrew will read from Rent Boys before we get out of here for the weekend.  But first, are you ready for your karaoke?  I guess.  Ah, yes.  Yeah, move the microphone.  Well, we learned that he likes to do the karaoke thing, Anthony.  Yeah, who doesn't?  And, you know, I think everyone needs to be in the studio for Andrew's karaoke performance. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, I think the boys, they've been working really hard, and I think they all need a little  entertainment, Anthony.  You're not that shy, are you?  No, he's fine.  Come on, right.  Do you want to stand up and stand and hold the mic like that?  Probably better to belt it out, yeah.  Yeah, why don't we get Mars in here to get him a mic that he can hold.  Um, you know, don't, Andrew, it's not like there's over a million people listening right  now.  Don't worry about that.  Don't worry about, uh, you know, about 15 guys just staring at you.  Eh. 
[02:54:00]  It's no big deal.  Can we get Mars to give him a better mic, or?  Yeah.  Uh, alright.  We'll do a little stall tactic here, Ant.  You got a stall tactic?  Yeah, you know that Caddyshack thing that came in from Chemistry?  Uh-huh.  That bit is sort of taking on a life of its own.  Oh, I like that.  I don't necessarily get this bit, but there are people out there that enjoy the Pat Battle  thing.  Uh-huh.  They chuckle and laugh and laugh.  Yeah.  And Chemistry took it to the next, uh, to the next level with this little thing the other 
[02:54:30]  day.  It's easy to grin when your Pat Battle ship comes in, and you've got the stock market beat.  But the man worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay, Pat Battle.  Do the honors.  Pat Battle.  Alright, that made me laugh.  I'm sorry.  That was funny.  Well, a new one came in from Thomas. 
[02:55:00]  Uh-huh.  You're not supposed to tell him.  Just play it.  What?  Thomas?  I'm not going to say what it's from.  Relax.  I'm giving the guy credit, though.  No, no, but the whole thing was just supposed to just play it.  Oh.  Just play it?  Yeah, I think that was the way you should go.  I don't know about that.  I disagree.  Just drop him in.  I disagree.  I think it should have been dropped in in conversation.  Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.  Fire at will, Commander. 
[02:55:30]  That's very good.  Pat Battle rules.  Ugh.  Hope he's brother's working on Pat Battle shirts.  Nice.  He sure is.  I'm sure he is, actually.  Pat Battle.  You can still pre-order your Pest shirts, though.  Your Opie and Anthony Pest t-shirts.  I understand they're being sold July 23rd in Cleveland.  Oh.  Well, show up there.  It's called Mixing and Matching Plugs, folks.  If you want an Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt or Opie and Anthony Pest t-shirt, 
[02:56:00]  just go to opianthony.com and there's a link there.  Explains the whole thing.  Hey, do we have a mic for this guy or what?  What the hell's that?  Oh, my God.  I asked for a mic he can hold.  Oh.  What, like Tom Jones?  Yes.  Got a hold.  And here's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mark.  You got that?  Mark.  Mark.  He's working on him.  Gotcha.  We just need a wire.  That's all.  Just so he can hold it.  We're taking care of him.  Okay.  And did we get...  We got to get everyone in the studio to enjoy Andrew singing.  Next time we do this, by the way, we'll be more prepared. 
[02:56:30]  There have to be girls in the studio.  Well, yeah.  Well, this was just...  Oh, yeah.  Impromptu.  Off the cuff.  My favorite word.  Serenade any chicks.  Be nice, right?  No, we'll do.  We'll have karaoke with the freaks of the show soon on the program.  I want Andrew to serenade some much.  Have Patty sing.  Guests.  So be guests.  Of the show.  Oh, Stalker Patty's a guest?  Yes.  Yes.  Patrick Minocchi's a guest?  Guests.  Wheelchair Fred is a guest?  Yes.  The retard Laverne Shirley? 
[02:57:00]  Yes.  And others?  Yes.  All right.  There we go.  Are you getting, like, pictures of this?  For opianthony.com?  All right.  Now, have good mic technique.  You got to be right up on that thing.  Yeah.  You want to put that down or no?  Do you want to put that down so it's not in the way of the...  Yeah, we go.  There you go.  You want him to just stand there or...  Whatever he wants to, you move around a little bit because you might want to move.  That's why I'm saying that's why we wanted you to have a core list.  Yeah, I would move around a little bit.  So you can move. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  All right, you guys ready?  Oh, please.  Chomping at the bit here.  This is Andrew, our new creation, the Big A, doing karaoke, the song, Waiting for a Girl Like  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So long, I've been looking too hard. 
[02:58:00]  I've been waiting too long.  Sometimes I don't know what I will find.  I only know it's a matter of time.  When you love someone, when you love someone, it feels so right, so warm and true. 
[02:58:30]  I need to know if you feel it too.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Would you tell me if I'm coming, I'm too strong?  A heart of mine has been hurt before.  This time I want to be sure. 
[02:59:00]  I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life.  I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life. 
[02:59:30]  I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life.  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.  You're so good.  When we make love, it's understood.  It's more than a torch we can say. 
[03:00:00]  Only in dreams be this way.  When you love someone, yeah, really love someone.  Now I know it's right from the moment I wake up to deep in the night.  There's nowhere on earth I'd rather be than holding you deep. 
[03:00:30]  I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life.  I've been waiting for a girl like you.  Loving will survive.  I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Bravo. 
[03:01:30]  Bravo.  Sierra.  Wow.  Now, why wasn't that a real karaoke version?  That's what I want to know.  Yes, Danny.  Mm-hmm.  I think because it's formatted for a DVD, like a real DVD player, I think the vocals are on a center channel,  so if you don't suck it out and try and play it through a stereo system, it's going to end up blending in there.  Yeah.  Wait, what? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  All right, we'll figure that out.  You know, this is a new bit on the show.  Yeah, we need real karaoke versions.  I think we need to give that mix to Bruce Kelly for the 80s channel.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Why not?  You know what the joke is here, by the way?  He's got to do a fast song.  Yeah.  He has too much time to...  To what?  To know what's going on.  Stammer.  Yeah.  What are some other songs that we apparently don't have the karaoke version to?  Did you practice Brown Eyed Girl? 
[03:02:30]  Once or twice.  A little bit.  You got the lyrics?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I have the lyrics.  You want to try Brown Eyed Girl real fast?  I would love to hear a little bit of that.  Well, I see the feedback.  They're asking for an encore here.  Oh, they certainly are.  So, guys, come on back into the studio.  Do you have the regular...  What version do we have of this?  It'll be sort of like that, you know, unfortunately.  We've got to work with what we've got today.  Okay.  We'll improve this, though.  All right. 
[03:03:00]  Brown Eyed Girl in?  Sure.  You ready, Andrew?  Yes.  Here we go.  Hey, we're in the hollow.  The days when the rains came.  Down in the hollow.  Playing our new game. 
[03:03:30]  Running.  Running.  Hey, hey.  Skipping and a-jumping.  In the misty morning fog.  With dogs a-thumping.  You, my brown eyed girl.  Happened. 
[03:04:00]  Today, it's so slow.  Going down to the old mine.  With a transistor radio.  Standing in the sunlight, I think.  Behind a rainbow's wall.  Slipping and a-sliding.  Along the waterfall.  Good girl.  You, my brown eyed girl. 
[03:04:30]  Remember when we used to sing?  aula-na-la-la-la-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la-la.  Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la-la.  Bo, boo, boo. 11!  Beau!  Beau! 
[03:05:00]  Beau!  Beau!  Don't work on me.  Don't you find my way, now that I'm on all my own?  I saw you just the other day, my, how have you grown?  In my memory back there, Lord, sometimes I overcome thinking about you.  I'm laughing, I'm running away, I understand your world. 
[03:05:30]  You, my brown-eyed girl, you, brown-eyed girl, remember when we sing,  Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
[03:06:00]  I fuckin' suck. He fuckin' sucks. They fuckin' suck. I fuckin' suck. I fuckin' suck. I fuckin' suck. I fuckin' suck. I fuckin' suck. You don't suck. I fuckin' suck. 
[03:06:30]  Alright, calm down, Andrew. Jesus, it wasn't that bad.  Wait, why didn't you hear that?  That was his inner voice there.  Well, uh, that was nice. I liked the faster tempo there.  I did, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I liked a lot of times when you'd chop the unnecessary lyrics, and you'd see when you came in with, girl.  It's overrated, singing the whole song.  I liked the parts, actually, where you would sing the line before it even came out.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Like, before you were actually able to, you kind of got a little ahead of the lyrics.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  That's good, though.  Alright.  Girl.  Well, great job. Great appearance.  Great appearance, Andrew.  Excellent job.  Look forward to having you back again at some point on the program.  There's right now a van in Munaki headed towards a brick wall.  Yeah.  His last crash.  Eh, eh.  Eh, what are you going to do?  Eh, eh.  I think this is what we're going to do with Andrew next.  We're going to do movie scenes.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  We're going to, you know, team you up with, like, Stalker Patty.  Yeah, I need somebody for him to work again.  Maybe Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Maybe, uh, Marion.  Pat from Munaki.  Had you a yuck for Lady Di.  Isn't that great?  Hey, how are you, Andrew?  Yeah, but we'll do that next on the show.  Movie scenes.  Famous movie scenes done by these guys.  Alright.  Andrew, good job.  Excellent.  We'll see you soon, okay, buddy?  Hey, where is the XM poll?  Where was that for the jocks?  What?  XMvote.com?  Alright, because I hear. 
[03:08:00]  Andrew.  Perhaps.  Let me look.  Yeah, he got you, Andrew.  Alright.  Favorite, uh, DJs?  Ah, top ten shows, DJs.  Bruce Kelly's number two.  What happened?  With 99 votes.  We're number one with 117.  You asses.  I told you people.  Not us, Bruce Kelly.  Bruce, put Bruce Kelly on top.  Bruce Kelly. 
[03:08:30]  Don't make a fucking maniac out of us.  Bruce gets number one.  Where's Randy Rhoads?  A third with 37 now.  Now it's just a...  Still at 37?  Yeah, now it's...  It's gonna be a massacre.  It's us against Bruce Kelly now.  Ugh.  Bruce Kelly is number one.  Vote for Bruce.  He deserves it.  That's right.  Him and his big, delicious...  Whatever that thing is.  Tumor.  He's got in the front of his pants.  Oh, that monstrosity.  That sweat towel.  The nerve of him to wear a sweat towel without ever walking to a gym. 
[03:09:00]  Too good.  Alright.  Where do we go next?  Whatever you want.  I'm in a good mood.  Yeah?  It's been a great show so far.  I think so, too.  Wonderful.  Yeah, Andrew's a hit.  We love Andrew.  That's some great singing.  Wow.  Alright, um...  I can't chuckle, though.  Just watch him.  Because he's doing...  He's making such an effort to sing those songs.  I keep trying to mess him up, too.  Like, when he's singing, I keep making my mouth...  You're the worst.  I saw you.  I'm like... 
[03:09:30]  Oh, you're trying to make it like you're talking to him?  Yeah, like, just...  Because he keeps looking over the paper at me.  And then back out of the paper.  Girl.  Yes, you, you.  Just keywords.  That's all you need.  You won't believe the warning that could be on the next can of soda you drank.  Then one city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  Right next to your house.  Gordon from Nova Scotia.  Can you picture Andrew singing Brown-Eyed Girl as he strangles a nine-year-old girl? 
[03:10:00]  You used to be...  You dirty girl.  Fa-la-la-la-la-la.  Oh, the last thing she hears.  But he doesn't, like, have sex with her.  He just hugs her and lays on her until the police come.  She suffocates.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  All right.  Well, we should, uh...  We'll regroup, I think.  All right.  We've got to figure out... 
[03:10:30]  I don't know.  We've got to figure out where we want to go next.  We'd have to hit him with a wrench to knock him down.  And he has a big neck.  Absolutely.  I think Club Soda Kenny, uh...  I think Kenny's position as security for this program is in grave danger.  Oh!  I wouldn't trust him anywhere.  Oh, I would.  I want him to make arrangements from now on.  Yeah?  We have him on the phone with the hotel.  Jimmy needs a seat.  Oh, that's what we can put.  Continental.  We only have Dalton. 
[03:11:00]  Okay.  Middle seat.  This is what we play now.  What are you...  Oh, yeah.  Tourette's Whorehouse, eh?  We haven't played this in a while.  Oh, wow.  That's an oldie.  And we do have a lot of new listeners from our Demanded World CD.  This is, uh...  This makes sense today.  It's called Tourette's Whorehouse.  Good afternoon.  Hi, um...  I'm going to be in the...  The Nevada area.  Uh-huh.  In about a...  Week. 
[03:11:30]  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's Syndrome.  Mm-hmm.  Which, uh...  Makes it hard to, uh...  Communicate.  Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one-activity party.  A hundred...  Wow, that's pretty cheap. 
[03:12:00]  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit,  because all the ladies are independent contractors.  Uh...  Uh, you don't think the girls would mind being with a...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Uh...  Uh...  Oh, good.  Good.  So I can come down and, uh...  You know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady. 
[03:12:30]  Oh!  Okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh!  I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy,  I can get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Oh!  Is that okay? 
[03:13:00]  That's no problem, hon.  Oh!  Do you take...  For the fees?  For the fees!  For the fees!  A mess of card?  Yes, we do.  Uh...  Could I bring a muzzle?  So I...  Don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't.  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with a lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's worth your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any... 
[03:13:30]  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever.  Do you have any...  Black girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay? 
[03:14:00]  This is Michael Trickman.  Hey, this is Chris Jericho.  This is Jessica Alba.  This is definitely Flavor Flavor on your radio.  This is Bill Burrow, the red-headed white boy from Chappelle Show.  This is Lois Griffin from Family Guy.  Hey, this is adult film star and former Guminatorial candidate, Mary Kay.  This is Jeffrey Ross.  Hey, this is Terry Jones here of Multipipers. 
[03:14:30]  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan, a.k.a. Brian Fellows.  Hey, this is The Game Triple H.  This is your big baby girl, Patrice O'Neal.  How are you, sweetie?  Hey, it's Colin Quinn.  This is Sam Cat Thomas.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  Hey, this is Ridge Ross from Last Comic Standing, Season 1 and Season 3.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony, my favorite radio show on XM.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And y'all listening to Opie and Anthony.  I said you're smart.  You're not dumb.  Like people think. 
[03:15:00]  Trisha.  We can destroy.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you. 
[03:15:30]  Please call the police.  All right.  Yeah, Bruce Kelly's ahead now.  Yeah?  Yeah, Bruce Kelly's ahead.  Kicking our ass.  169 votes.  So, how many we have?  162.  How come people keep voting for us?  No more Opie and Anthony votes.  I know.  Just Bruce.  I now make us on top.  Really?  Just go back and forth.  No, I don't care.  Yeah, have them fight between each other. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, you guys fight it out.  All right.  I don't know.  The boys want us to play this Taco Bell 911 call.  Another frivolous 911 call.  Some crazy lady that called 911 because I guess she has a bad taco.  A bad.  Call the doctor.  That's not the type of taco.  Of course not.  That's what I should be.  The real taco.  I should be like the news girl.  I should be like, I don't even have to, I just wear a tighter shirt that shows my tits  off and do what every woman does on a radio show, which is destroy it and remove the humor. 
[03:16:30]  That's not the type of taco, Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, Anthony.  Anthony.  Now, seriously.  The type of taco.  Thank goodness I'm here.  Keep you guys in line.  Keep you in line if you're going down a, you know, kind of a place where you shouldn't  go, like where, a humor zone, anywhere funny, you just mump, you mump, that's exactly it.  You're a mump, dumb blonde hair, trying to sound younger than you are in the air, kick 
[03:17:00]  you right in the stomach.  All right, well, let's go to the call, see if it's good.  I ask Steve, I go, is this thing real?  He goes, how do I?  I don't know.  I've had enough of Steve not committing.  I don't know.  It could be real.  It might not be.  Steve's a genius.  He never commits to anything.  If you ask Steve, is that funny, a couple of laughs.  Some people would think so.  Yes, I can see how it could be.  Are you one of those people, baby shorts?  See how it could be.  Some would find it funny.  You really should run for office someday. 
[03:17:30]  Why?  Oh, just because I'm so noncommittal?  You're just great with one foot on one side, one on the other, and perfect diction in the  middle going, what do you want from me?  I just, look, I know I'm not going to avoid getting bashed upside the head.  It's just a question of carefully selecting.  You know how to stay out of trouble.  I can try.  I can certainly try.  You know what?  This sounds legit to me.  It really does.  But who knows?  It could be a setup.  What's the setup to the best?  It's another one of those frivolous 911 calls where a woman calls a 911 dispatcher very 
[03:18:00]  upset that she got ripped off and didn't get her taco the way she wanted it.  All right.  Is this true, Steve?  Could be, Jimmy.  Could be.  911, what's your emergency?  I need assistance at Jim's, Lincoln's, and Woodbury's.  I know.  What's the problem?  They throw my damn dollars.  He won't fix my taco.  I'm going to have a ride in it.  He's going with my dollar and 10 cents.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Slow down.  What's going on?  Hello?  What did I say?  I can't tell.  You're yelling at me.  I need assistance.  I want my dollar or my taco.  You're having a problem with the taco? 
[03:18:30]  The owner, the proprietor here.  You're having a problem with the taco?  I am.  The owner, bitch.  Pardon me.  Excuse me?  I am upset.  I know.  You have to calm down and kind of tell me what's going on here now.  How did you elect you to any goddamn thing I'm saying?  Are you drunk?  No, I am not a drunk.  Okay.  Then why don't you just start talking a little bit.  You want me to stop?  You get some motherfucking ass over here.  Slow down.  What?  I need some information from you, so slow down.  You bring your ass and get my motherfucking time out of here.  My ass is staying in the office here.  You know what I'm telling me?  You need to...  You want me to do assistance to me? 
[03:19:00]  You need to calm down and tell me something here.  Okay?  All right, bitch.  What was wrong with the taco?  The motherfucker refused to sell it to me.  He refused to sell you a taco?  He won't get any of my money back.  He took your money, but he won't get you a taco.  Yeah, my goddamn house is locked up, you motherfucking dude.  I got $1.35 here.  Me?  Why are you calling me names?  Look, are you coming in now?  As far as I'm concerned, you can have that taco.  I don't want my goddamn dollar.  What?  I said, as far as I'm concerned, you can have the taco.  Tell that bitch over here.  How am I going to get to this before I get my money?  Okay. 
[03:19:30]  What's your name?  Antoinette.  Antoinette.  Yeah.  Okay, what's your last name, Antoinette?  Jones.  Antoinette Jones.  I want my dollar and my taco.  And he took your money, but he wasn't getting your food.  Jimmy's shaking his head like, no.  Don't buy it because...  I think it sounds legit.  I'll tell you why I don't.  Because he's not saying, ma'am, is there an emergency? 
[03:20:00]  Ma'am, do you need police?  He's not asking questions that he should be asking.  And he's saying things like, I'm keeping my ass in here, which I don't think a real 911 operator...  I mean, we know they've said some odd things, but he's not establishing, look, is there an emergency?  I think he knows right away there isn't an emergency.  Probably right.  I think he knows.  It almost sounds like right from the start he saw what was happening and realized, let me just get this woman's information so we can send a car to arrest her.  You know, she's tying up a 911 line. 
[03:20:30]  Maybe.  Because it almost sounds like now he's talking to somebody in the background, waving someone over.  You hear him typing something.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe you're right.  I'm in Steve's camp now.  I don't know.  I'm not really sure.  Hey, Steve, is it real?  Well, it might be.  It might not be.  Thank you for presenting both possibilities.  You're welcome, Jimmy.  I like to do it now.  That's not right.  What's your day to work?  I don't have to give you all that.  Come get my dollar.  I'm upset. 
[03:21:00]  You don't have to do anything if you don't want.  Well, then God damn it, it'll fix me.  Calm down.  I'm trying to get an example from you.  You're sitting up there, motherfucker.  You're eating, aren't you?  I'm not going to lie to see me.  This motherfucker's insulting me, and you are, too.  Antoinette?  Yes.  Are you going to give me the information, or do you just want to go with me?  I'm just saying what the fuck...  You better come here and get my dollar out this desk.  Or else what?  Look, do you refuse to help me?  No, I'm trying to get some information.  What the fuck do you want?  Where are you at right now?  What did I say?  Where did I say I was?  I know, but are you going to stay there, or are you going to go to your house? 
[03:21:30]  Out here.  Don't come here with no nigger.  What?  Don't bring no nigger here.  Who's a nigger?  Look.  Are you coming?  Are you calling me a nigger?  No, I said don't bring no nigger here.  What does that have to do with this?  You come here.  Do you want...  Are you saying you want a white deputy, or what?  How long?  Are you saying you want a white deputy?  Exactly.  You don't want any...  No, I don't.  African-American deputies?  No, I don't.  Why's that?  Nick.  I don't know. 
[03:22:00]  I don't know if he would have used that language.  Yeah, but those 911 guys have been nailed saying some pretty obnoxious stuff before.  Oh, I know.  That's...  Nothing wrong with wanting a white deputy.  I lean towards saying, yes, that's real.  Really?  Yeah.  Kind of lean in that way.  I lean toward we shouldn't have played it, and I hate it.  No?  Yeah, I don't know.  I hate it.  Steve's running around saying it's the greatest thing ever.  That wasn't bad.  I did not say that at all.  Waving it in the air. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, my God.  I just saw him before the show in the office.  Waving it around.  I know.  This should be in Fort Knox because it's gold.  Don't encourage him, Steve.  Just every once in a while, he gets a good one.  All right.  Yeah, a lot of people calling shenanigans.  All right.  Michigan, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I was a 911 dispatcher for seven and a half years, and that call, the way she's talking, 
[03:23:00]  everything, for inner city, what have you, is very typical of the way they call and the  way a dispatcher would handle it.  Oh, okay.  You don't want to get in trouble for, you know, telling them off or not believing them  or whatever.  You take all the information, you listen to the story, what have you, and you just send  it over to the dispatcher who will dispatch the call.  And, you know, however the police want to handle it, that's up to them.  You know, a lot of times you get an officer saying, well, you know, yeah, right, whatever, 
[03:23:30]  you know, go over there, you know, spend 10 minutes taking care of it, you know, and  moving on.  But definitely, I mean, that's just typical, typical call.  See, there's another one that says, I think it's real.  Yeah, hey, I'm from Steven Lynch's whole town, man.  You got, yeah, Jimmy needs to do a show with Steven Lynch back in Saginaw, man.  I went to school with him.  Saginaw.  They were talking about me and Lynch doing a tour at one point last year.  Yeah.  He was actually out with Hedberg.  And then, I don't know, I think they just stayed on tour.  How's he doing these days?  Lynch is probably still touring at Hedberg. 
[03:24:00]  Unfortunately, not as good.  Another comedian died, by the way, a guy, a really nice guy named Freddy Soto, a comedian  from L.A., 35 years old, just died in his sleep.  Cool.  There might be more to it, but that's all I know.  Wow.  He was a really nice dude.  You knew the guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a great guy.  Thanks for comics.  Jesus.  Usually comics live long, man.  The Groucho, I mean, Rodney, Rodney, and Rodney just smoked pot.  Henny Youngman?  George Burns, Bob Hope.  I mean, these guys live a long time, man. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  Jerry Lewis is old.  Yeah.  Laughter's the best medicine.  That's what I say.  Ah, that's what they say.  Next to AZT.  All right.  One of my favorite shows on TV, Anthony, is Celebrity Fit Club.  Yes.  I haven't watched it this season, unfortunately.  The new version?  Oh, it's great.  It's absolutely great.  Who are the fatties they have this season?  And are they big and fat, or are they just out of shape?  Because I heard some of the names, and I'm like, I don't remember this guy being fat.  Well, they got Bam's father, Phil. 
[03:25:00]  Okay.  He's fat.  He's fat.  They got Janie Lane from Warrant.  Now, I couldn't see him as being a fat guy.  He's, what are the, I think they said he's six foot or 6'1 and 190 pounds.  Is that fat?  No.  I have no clue.  But he has, like, just a big beer belly.  So he's got a gut on him.  Yeah.  And he looks really lame.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And then you got some plus-size model who wants to be 200 pounds, a black model.  Wants to be 200 pounds? 
[03:25:30]  Well, I think she is right around there or whatever, and she wants to stay at that weight.  Oh, she doesn't see anything.  And they told her they want her to lose 50 pounds during the show, and she was laughing  her ass off, like, yeah, right, I want to stay this big.  And then they had Wendy the Snapple Lady.  She's back for a second appearance?  Yeah, and she's just, she just.  I'm absolutely crying.  She just needs to be slapped.  Ugh.  Yeah.  And the tension getting to it.  Don't you hate her?  I remember her bitching a money last season.  I really hate her.  Bitching last season that she gained all the weight because her parents had another kid. 
[03:26:00]  Right.  Yeah, right.  And it made her feel unwanted and unloved.  Right.  How about now, fatso?  Yeah, what's your excuse now?  And then, you know, she was talking on the first season how, you know, she's going to  make this part of her lifestyle, and she's really learned a lot about herself and stuff.  Yeah.  So the new season starts, and they weigh everybody.  She's gained nine pounds since last season.  Of course.  And then they got Willie Ames from Eight is Enough.  Is he fat?  I don't, I guess. 
[03:26:30]  I hope so.  He wasn't a big guy.  I don't remember the others.  Oh, Gary Busey, of course, who's the star of the show.  Gary Busey, he's really out of shape, but is he fat?  Have you seen him?  He's out of shape.  I know he's got a gut on him.  Yeah, he's out of shape.  He's big.  Yeah.  But he's just out of his mind, and that's the reason why I'm watching the show.  That's why they put him on.  Yeah, every week we've got to play the Gary Busey clips from the show.  No one's as big, though, as last season.  Ralphie Mae?  Because they had Ralphie on last season.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, and then they have, oh, yeah. 
[03:27:00]  Remember, Jack A.  Jack A?  Jack A.  From?  And she still wants to be called Jack A.  Two, two, seven.  And we should be calling her Jack.  Holy shit.  What?  She's just a mess all around.  But she's still.  Don't go into room two, two, seven.  You stay out of room two, two, seven.  She's just a mess, though.  There's a fat, well, there's some people in there you don't want to see, Doc. 
[03:27:30]  A fat fuck.  Every fucking day.  Every fucking day.  Jack A is trying to bring an outside jelly donut into this situation.  Jack A.  I bet you she's not opposed to eat it, right?  K to K1 to Jack K12. 
[03:28:00]  Every fucking day.  Every day.  All right.  Thank you for that music.  Over and over again.  I want to find a way to pipe this music into my apartment and have it loop 24 hours.  Oh, with the horrors that are taking place in there.  Just walk around with an axe.  He's covered in piss and women's shit and trying to scrape grout out of his wood floor.  That's Andrew's ringtone.  What a great ringtone that would be. 
[03:28:30]  Anyway, want to play a couple clips from Celebrity Fit Club?  All right.  Do you have to set them up?  I don't know.  Here's Phil, Bam's father.  His idea is about food.  Phil, I've got to tell you something.  My five-year-old cousin has a better idea about weight loss and eating than you do.  And don't share any of your philosophy on eating.  Apple, a lot more calories because it weighs more.  Cotton candy, light and fluffy.  Cantaloupe, heavier than bread. 
[03:29:00]  Well, in truth, the day you eat it, as you eat it, that is the truth.  If you eat it, if you get weight and eat an apple, then jump on the scale, you'll weigh more.  But if you eat the cotton candy that day, it won't show up until the next day.  Mistop.  That's a great way to look at it.  That's good logic.  How heavy is cotton candy?  Right.  It's not heavy at all.  He nailed it.  You eat an apple and weigh yourself right away.  Apple's got some bulk to it.  You're going to be heavier.  Yeah.  Makes perfect sense.  I like how this guy's eating it.  More from Phil. 
[03:29:30]  Maybe not.  And maybe eventually.  I think mowing the lawn can burn calories.  In the summertime, it's really not necessary to go to the gym because a lot of people pay somebody  to mow their lawn, and then they go to the gym.  But if you mow your lawn yourself, that saves a trip to the gym.  Now, going down is just as much exercise because you've got to hold your stomach good muscles.  He's on a riding mower.  He has convinced himself that the twisting and turning of the tractor is a workout. 
[03:30:00]  So he's not even mowing the lawn with a stand-up push mower.  But he's serious.  Yeah, he's losing weight because he's steering.  Yeah, he's steering and sweating, cutting corners and stuff.  Yeah, sweating.  So that's a little taste of Phil, Bam's father on Celebrity Fit Club.  I heard Bam's girlfriend came out on some station after she broke up with Bam because  she found out Bam was fucking other girls.  And she said that the whole show he does is fake and that the family doesn't even live 
[03:30:30]  in that house.  Oh, yeah.  It's a fake house.  Everybody that's involved with it is paid.  And yeah, none of those stunts he does are real authentic.  She also claimed that Bam had sex with Jessica Simpson.  Yes.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I don't know.  I met him once.  He was at that Babe Fest, actually.  He was one of the other.  Oh, yeah?  What did you think of him?  Irrelevant to me.  Irrelevant?  On every level.  I did not recognize him.  Not even an issue.  You didn't even know who he is, huh?  I had no clue.  Were people psyched to meet him?  Wouldn't know. 
[03:31:00]  I didn't look at them either.  You didn't even see.  You just take yourself out of a situation completely?  Completely.  You don't even look at your surroundings and realize, well, that guy's getting a lot of attention.  I said to Florentine, is he famous?  Yeah.  Got a picture of me and him and his brother.  Okay.  He's very famous these days.  Oh, so you got a picture.  Of course.  And I looked at Gene all night.  Yeah.  So I didn't know what Bam did.  Lovingly.  All right.  Tell him you don't want to see him.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  We got a couple quick clips from Jeannie Lane.  Do you remember Jeannie Lane, Anthony?  Of course.  He's the lead singer of Warrant.  We said that already.  Cherry pie.  She's my cherry pie. 
[03:31:30]  Is he all fat now?  I bet you he ate a lot of cherry pie in the last few years.  Fantastic.  He had better write a new song called She's My Yogurt.  Fantastic.  Too much cherry pie.  Wasn't he going out with that hot babe for the video?  What was her name?  Yeah.  What was her name?  I think her name was Bobby Brown. 
[03:32:00]  Bobby Brown.  Very good.  The chick Bobby Brown.  He's not going out with anyone above a four.  Now it's Bobby Brown, the guy.  Probably.  With this one, the guy with the Zappa song.  Bobby Brown.  You saw my friend Zappa, Bobby Brown?  Yes.  Write a song ever written.  No.  Ever.  About anything.  And that includes Star Spangled Banner.  Well, Jeannie Lane is the pussy on the show, Anthony.  Oh, he is?  Looks like he's going to cry at any moment.  I'm absolutely crying over here. 
[03:32:30]  If I get to my desired weight, back to where I was really, really happy with myself when  I looked at myself in the mirror.  That was a feeling that I haven't experienced in a very long time.  I don't know.  I've been really unhappy with the way I look for a long time.  Oh, he's breaking up.  Yeah, yeah.  Bruce Kelly's crying somewhere, too, right now.  Oh, I was watching Warren. 
[03:33:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  It's all right, Bruce.  It's okay.  How are you there?  It's funny.  I relate to this fella.  What I find works for me is a little bit of bike and then light weights and then you  sit in the stem room and then you go and you swim a little bit.  Is that what you're doing on a daily basis?  I haven't done it in three days because I've been so tired all week.  I'm going to go today again.  I've been too tired to do anything.  Good for you, Jimmy.  I've noticed a change.  Yeah, you're looking good, Jimmy.  Yeah, you're going to see me in the mirror when I wake up.  I sleep nude.  Are you on the nude? 
[03:33:30]  To answer all those emails.  Do you sleep in the nude?  I sleep nude with the air conditioner on and my cover on me.  And then when I get up in the morning, I look at my flatter stomach in the mirror  and my cock.  Are you hanging in the morning or are you all bunched up?  No, I'm good in the morning.  Yeah?  You got like morning schlong?  I sleep with a weight tied to it.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, sticky bun. 
[03:34:00]  Don't.  You guys are missing the obvious.  Go ahead.  All work and no play makes Jack A a dull girl.  God damn it, that was a good one.  There you go.  There you go, Tony.  How do you like it?  How's his book?  Here we go.  I wouldn't hurt one goddamn hair in her weave.  Another clip from Janie Lane.  Now, listen.  I know you were a rocker, a big time rocker.  I don't know your songs.  I don't know your history.  I know your medical.  I know you're medical. 
[03:34:30]  I bet they're very good.  They're good.  You know what?  You got chicken legs and you got a big gut.  You got some other problems.  You have hypertension.  Okay?  And you have problems with the thyroid.  Okay, so it's just not about your looks, Janie.  It's about how you feel.  So my question is, how serious are you about your health?  Very serious.  I want to be a healthier person.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[03:35:00]  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Hang in there, Janie.  Hang in there.  Poor Janie.  Chicken legs and a big gut.  Where are you going, Hawk?  All right.  All right, moving on.  We have this black plus-size supermodel, Anthony.  Right.  She was on one of those model shows with the really hot black model that did the show. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, on one of those reality shows.  Supermodel.  Where they voted one off every week.  Right.  That show.  Yeah.  Well, let's see what she says.  Tyra Banks.  Tyra Banks, yeah.  But this isn't Tyra, of course.  Takara, you seem to think you got the perfect body, don't you?  Yes, I am pretty fabulous if I do say so myself.  Fabulous.  Hey, I'm 200 pounds.  Can you handle that?  Yeah.  Good.  My goal is to be the first black plus-size supermodel in the world. 
[03:36:00]  First black plus-size supermodel in the world?  Yeah.  There was a big call for that.  Sure is.  Black black chicks.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, what are you going to sell?  I'm sure Andrew has goals, too, out there.  You should be doing an ad for reinforced floors.  That's what you should sell.  Oh, God, I hate when they do that.  And black women are just notorious for this.  The whole, I look good.  Like, who's the woman that hosts Showtime at the Apollo? 
[03:36:30]  Sinbad?  What the hell's her name?  She's in some movies.  Monique?  Monique.  Oh, yeah, Monique.  Very good, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Monique.  And every week, she comes out, and she's dressed in a fucking gunny sack.  Just this huge thing, this tent on her.  And the audience is howling and hooting.  And she spins around and goes, what you think, Apollo?  And they're all, whoo!  She goes, yeah, I know. 
[03:37:00]  I looked at myself in the murr.  And I was like, I look good.  And you look, you go, there's no way anyone's looking at that going, yeah, I got to knock me off a piece of that.  They get this delusional thing in their head that people actually find that attractive.  I'm not a big fan of, like, diet soda or diet ice cream.  You know, like, I'm not really a fan of the word diet.  I feel good to be able to be 200 pounds and look like this.  And a lot of people are like, I have to lose my hips or my thighs or I need to lose this. 
[03:37:30]  This is something asking me for you to grab on to.  This is some love for you.  I'll defend her a little bit.  She's got the young fat going for her.  Because she's only, like, 20 years old.  Young fat is not as bad as, like, you know.  Old fat?  Middle-aged fat.  Middle-aged fat.  And, you know, then it starts smelling.  Cellulite fat?  Smelling in the creases and stuff.  Young fat is almost doable.  Still smells like baby shampoo and bubble gum?  How about this, um, fat plus size models? 
[03:38:00]  You all fly on a plane together.  So how about that?  So I don't have to have your sweaty blubber on me.  I don't care what you look like.  I don't care if you drop dead.  I actually root for it.  But when you're next to me on a plane and your fat fuck eating ways are interfering with me,  I have a problem.  Now there's a problem.  So lean over and put this in your mouth.  Your weight tonight is...  205 pounds.  Isn't that fabulous? 
[03:38:30]  Now, I know you think that's fabulous, but I gotta tell you something.  Your body fat percentage is 29%.  Wow.  And that is way too much for someone 23 years old.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  I look good, though.  You laugh at it.  I mean, you can laugh at it now, but you know what?  High percentage body fat means diabetes, means cardiovascular disease, means blood vessel disease.  And I'm not gonna let that happen.  So we're gonna work on this together.  Okay.  She's one of those people who's desperately trying to just smile and make it okay.  You're a fat fuck and you couldn't be happy about it. 
[03:39:00]  There's tears behind her smile.  She's the type of girl, you bang her from behind, you grab her back and it's like a sharp-faced face.  You can just hold on to like six inches of back fat.  Hold on to it like big handles, like right in the middle of the back where there should be no fat.  Yeah, it's just pouring over the bra strap.  And then under the bra strap, you got another one and another one hanging down.  And another one.  Don't you want to just bite it?  Back boobs.  Just bite it.  All right.  As you feel the crunch of fat and gristle going through your teeth. 
[03:39:30]  All right, let's move on.  We got to get the Gary Busey clips in before we get out of here in a few minutes.  Ooh.  He is the star of Celebrity Fit Club, without a doubt.  Here's Gary Busey.  I don't look at it as a physical challenge.  I look at it as an amusement park with the body.  What a tool, man.  What a complete ass this guy is.  I love him.  Gary Busey.  You got to love this guy.  You're talking crazy.  I'm not crazy. 
[03:40:00]  No.  Where do you live?  Wherever I'm standing.  I'll be the other side.  When I went off a motorcycle going 45 miles an hour,  I hit my hair in a curb without a helmet, spread my skull.  I died after brain surgery.  Tell us how that's changing what you're doing today.  Supernatural information.  And it's time for me to get back in a shape that honors my truth.  Your arm, Mr. Joshua.  Your cigarette lighter.  Huh?  Your cigarette lighter. 
[03:40:30]  That worst line in movie history.  Where'd you get him?  Cycles or us?  Is that the worst line ever?  You're a lighter.  Fear.  F-A-I-R.  False evidence appear in Rio.  I think when it comes to Gary,  the abuseisms,  you can be philosophical,  and you can be full of f***ing.  Go for it.  The greatest risk of all is not taking one.  Wow.  Wow.  So profound.  Very deep.  More head hit that curb.  I can think of a greater risk than I tried in Rio twice. 
[03:41:00]  Gary, you've been very athletic all your life,  and now you're training with a bad knee after a lot of illnesses.  How do you feel?  The bad knee injury doesn't bother me anymore mentally, physically, spiritually, and emotionally.  And the word team, T-E-A-M, that stands for together, everyone achieves more.  And the first things we'll start with is focus, ambition, discipline, and follow-through.  And we do it together.  We do it strong.  The circle will not be broken. 
[03:41:30]  And that's my pursuit of this goal, the victory.  Thank you so much.  He's out of his mind.  I love it.  One more from Gary Busey.  He's out of his mind.  Willie, how do you feel about being on Gary's team?  I have my reservations, but I think we're going to work hard.  I'll tell you that.  What are your reservations?  Yeah, I'd like to hear what your reservations are.  You're my reservation.  Why?  You're my reservation because you are out there, man.  I think at one point you and I are going to clash.  No, we won't clash if you consider the team mate of it. 
[03:42:00]  And there's no reason to clash when you're on a team going for a common goal, which is victory.  Woo!  Sometimes I don't want to, you know, sometimes I don't want to hear this.  Sometimes I just want to, sometimes you just want to, you know, like, hey.  What you have is self-doubt.  And the word doubt, D-O-U-B-T, that stands for debating on understanding bewildering thoughts.  I don't give a word what it means.  I just want to work out.  That's what I'm talking about, Gary.  You know what?  Willie lost his dictionary when he was in fifth grade. 
[03:42:30]  Hey, Gary should have this one.  Don't underestimate cardio heart exercise.  That'd be douche.  Yes.  Yes, it would be.  Bravo, Sierra.  Douche.  All right.  Oh, I hear the music.  Thank God.  Because we want to get the hell out of here.  Yeah, I got to nurse my cold.  T-shirt with a T-shirt under it.  Undershirt.  Why are you looking at undershirt?  Undershirt.  He's trying to look like Brad Pitt.  Let him be.  Is that a sleeveless wife beater, or does it have sleeves? 
[03:43:00]  Oh, you are a creep on ice.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show, Vinny?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that a cure for Parkinson's is a 90-pound lead helmet.  Aw, lead hat, you idiot.  A lead helmet would work, but the hat is so much funnier.  He blew the best line of the week.  It implies that a man has a 90-pound hat on.  A hat.  He's just sitting there slumped in a chair, but you made it a helmet and ruined it.  Jim in Canada, what did you learn on the show today? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, this week I learned that if you're in the shower with the CNBC anchor, don't drop the soap.  All right.  Oh, very good.  That was what you learned for the week, I guess.  Rob on Long Island, what did you learn on the show?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  That one that's giving me something dumps would look like a cliff collapse.  Ah, like a cliff collapse, yes.  That was a great line, too, but your phone sucked.  Thanks.  Bad cell phone guy.  All right, assault on the media.  Hopefully we'll get a few over the weekend.  Harry Potter.  Best assault on the media will win a MiFi and a day in the studio with Dopey Nance. 
[03:44:00]  Please give away the ending of the Harry Potter movie.  Please drive by with a bullhorn.  A book, whatever it is.  Please give it away with a bullhorn.  We love you for that.  Yeah, they're selling the book at midnight tonight, so there'll be lines.  So just drive by and say that the...  What are you pointing at?  Enjoy the book, Eric.  What's that mean?  There will be news crews going live.  Professor Snope kills Dumbledore.  Half-Blood Prince is Greyfinder. 
[03:44:30]  Hermione and Ron get together.  Draco leaves Hogwarts.  Who gives a fuck about any of that nonsense?  What is it?  But if you get on live TV and you spoil some of that for the Harry Potter fans,  that could be huge for the Opie and Anthony program.  See you guys Monday.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  The Internet Show. </pre>
