<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the heavy rain predicted for New York City, leading to a conversation about unreliable landscapers and Opie's flooded basement. This segued into a broader commentary on human incompetence, punctuated by the hashtag "#whitepeopleproblems."  The hosts then launched into a scathing critique of True TV reality shows like *Operation Repo*, *Hardcore Pawn*, and *Bait Car*,  lambasting their obvious fakery, staged scenes, and the viewers' gullibility, using highly offensive language to describe both the shows and their audiences.  Specific examples of perceived manipulation were detailed, including exaggerated reactions, convenient camera placement, sound effects, and the use of "actuality" instead of "reality" in disclaimers.

The conversation shifted to a car accident the hosts witnessed, focusing on the peculiar phenomenon of shoes being left at accident scenes, followed by a listener's anecdote about encountering Michael Douglas.  This transitioned into a discussion of the hosts' encounters with various New Yorkers – a doomsday preacher, homeless individuals, and the listener Roland –  as documented by Opie's new camera.  Opie showcased footage of these encounters.  The segment included strong criticism of New York City cab drivers and sanitation workers, filled with offensive language and disparaging remarks.  The show concluded this section with a humorous "Afro of the Day" award.

The next segment focused on the hosts' new Contour cameras – one for windshield mounting and one for hat mounting – and their frustrations with their SiriusXM employment. Opie expressed a preference for video over radio, contrasting their situation with Kevin Smith’s success in visual media.  They discussed new high-definition sunglasses cameras and launched into a rant about the show's technical limitations and perceived lack of support from SiriusXM management, citing cancelled events and a last-minute cancellation of a post-show meeting.  This led to a humorous exchange involving suggestive comments and a photo of genitalia. Opie mentioned the possibility of creating their own True TV-style show and his desire to move away from his YouTube channel. The discussion included details about different camera types, and Opie’s "splash videos"— videos of him splashing pedestrians with puddles while driving—  along with a critique of a poorly filmed example.

The show briefly touched on news items: Reggie Jackson's birthday, updates on a French man and Arnold Schwarzenegger's situation, and a woman who talked on her phone for 16 hours on an Amtrak train.  They also teased an upcoming announcement about a new addition to their channel.  A listener called in suggesting a West Side location for a splash video, leading to a promotion for a physical fitness challenge with a NASCAR-themed contest, involving Bobo (described as a "creep"), Eric (with a long, uncut afro), and Iraq (who was apparently uninformed while on his honeymoon).  The challenge involved 500-word essays.  The segment included discussions about Sam Roberts's radio show, Eastside Dave (who nearly set a wedding on fire), and Opie's plans to film his Pocono Raceway experience with multiple cameras, concluding with an anecdote about an energy wrap.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a conflict between Opie and E-Rock, stemming from perceived unfair criticism on a previous broadcast. The argument devolved into name-calling and insults, with audio clips played as evidence.  Sam Roberts and Jim Norton were mentioned, with Opie seemingly favoring Sam.  The conversation included unrelated tangents, such as conspiracy theories (JFK assassination), E-Rock's perceived social awkwardness, and Opie's gift-giving habits (a dispute over an Islanders hockey picture). Twitter interactions and Roland’s participation were also featured. The segment concluded with a ranking of who E-Rock was most angry with, Opie ultimately taking the top spot.

The next segment revolved around gifts Opie received from "Iraq," including an Islanders jersey and a Lost box set, which Opie re-gifted.  The conversation became heated, with Opie defending his actions. Anthony added humorous commentary, revealing he received gifts from Iraq that he appreciated.  The discussion expanded to include broader perspectives on gift-giving and the hosts' preferences for female bodybuilders, using highly graphic and offensive language.  The segment concluded with the announcement of Joe Rogan's podcast being featured on their new channel, with Anthony on Long Island present in studio.

The final segment covered a rumor about a "radio chick" and a virus, Bill Burr and Patrice O'Neal's upcoming appearances, the addition of Joe Rogan to their channel, and internal company issues.  The rumor, possibly started by Alan "Sniffing," caused a Twitter frenzy.  The hosts discussed scheduling difficulties with high-profile guests, including Aziz Ansari and Zari, and criticized the media’s coverage of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s scandal and John Edwards.  A bizarre story about Dominique Strauss-Kahn and an alleged rape, with speculation about AIDS transmission, was also recounted in graphic detail.  The segment highlighted the positive reaction to Joe Rogan’s addition, contrasted with negative feedback, and ended with a discussion of internal company politics, frustrations over guest bookings (Russell Brand and Patrice O'Neal), and an awkward bathroom encounter with a coworker. The NASCAR contest was also promoted again.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  Has rapture begun? 
[00:01:30]  I took that swig of water.  I had three ice cubes out of my mouth and I couldn't talk.  I just want to know if this is the rapture  because eventually humans will be on this earth  when the rapture does happen.  When something, yeah, does go awry.  They're saying there's going to be more rain today  than the whole month.  Really?  The whole month that we usually get.  They're talking maybe five inches of rain  for the New York area today.  Five inches?  With all those May flowers you're supposed to have. 
[00:02:00]  Ah, no, that was April showers, right?  Yeah, but if you go back a couple months ago,  I said on this very program  that the whole thing has shifted.  Shifted a month.  And it's not April showers anymore.  It's May showers.  Pull the fucking tape.  June flowers.  Yes.  There was a shift somewhere along the way.  You might be right.  They're changing the zodiac a little bit, right?  Didn't they add a sign?  When we were growing up, it was April showers,  certainly in the New York area.  But now, I'm telling you, every year,  because I pay attention,  because it's my birthday month,  and it's always a rainy, shitty month. 
[00:02:30]  Every year.  May showers bring June...  Mud?  Mud.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't rhyme, though.  Inconvenience.  Bring June drivers that don't know  how to drive in the rain.  That's a good one.  I had to, yesterday, actually,  go out to the pool  and turn the little knob to waste  and pump water out.  Oh, boy.  Because all the rain we got  actually increased the level of my pule.  And the dumb fuck landscapers, 
[00:03:00]  there was a strip of carpeting outside by my...  You know when you go down some cement stairs  in people's backyards to the basement area?  Sure.  Well, at the bottom of that basement area is a drain.  Never worked very well.  So I had a big drain thing put in  right under the door to the basement  with a pump system  that just pumps that shit right out of there.  Because one day, I swear,  it had clogged up the little shit drain  that they put in there.  And this was before my basement was finished. 
[00:03:30]  It left a mark.  Like, you know when the tide comes up  and then it goes down,  you could tell how high the water was on the beach?  Same thing,  two and a half feet up my door.  Wow.  In that stairwell.  So water was just pouring in  underneath the door and shit.  So I had this big pump system put in.  No problems now.  And, uh,  but the landscapers thought it would be nice  to take that strip of carpet  that was sitting out there  and put it in front of the doorway. 
[00:04:00]  Like, I guess,  so you could wipe your feet before you go in.  Thus covering...  The drain.  The drain.  So the water yesterday came up again,  not that high,  but under the door  and went in underneath the door  and into the basement.  But it's in the cement part of the basement,  you know,  the only part that isn't finished.  Right, right.  Thank God.  But there's a few things stored in there,  like Christmas boxes and stuff,  all wet on the bottom of the boxes.  It's just like you're fucking cocks.  People are just incompetent  no matter where you are or what you do. 
[00:04:30]  They really are stupid across the board, right?  Yes.  People are just stupid across the board.  They're dummies.  No one thinks for a second.  Just basic shit they can't figure out.  Yeah.  They've got to deal with it.  But the amount of water is fucking ridiculous.  Is that a white person problem?  That's a white person problem.  What's your hashtag?  White people problems?  White people problems.  Yeah, I like that.  White people problems.  I like that hashtag you started.  Occasionally, whenever something happens,  I go,  white people problems. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Keith is having a white person problem with his boat.  Really?  Wow.  I don't know.  I put a couple of new engines in last year  and go to start it up  and there's some type of problem.  I have to take care of my boat.  You just described every boat owner  in the world,  not even in the country.  Boats are probably  the worst thing you can get  if you don't want to throw money at something.  Because a boat, 
[00:05:30]  you can put new shit in  and then something else will fuck up.  And by the time you get to that,  the new shit you put in is fucking up.  Right.  Just constantly trying  to keep your boat running.  How big is this boat?  It's 87 foot.  No.  I had one like that.  Did you?  It was the yacht.  No, I believe it's  30,  34,  something like that.  That's a big boat, right?  It's a nice one.  He has like a real boat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a real one.  Yeah, 34 footer.  Wow.  That's all right. 
[00:06:00]  You think your friends  have a little shitty,  almost like the equivalent  of a rowboat  where they did the racism commercial?  Yeah.  With a little fucking engine on it?  Does he sleep on it?  He went from a little one  to a bigger one.  Quincy.  I gotta put the cuffs on him, Sam.  Quincy.  A creep.  Shit.  Yeah, man.  You just throw money away  if you have a boat.  But when you get out there  on the water,  it seems to be worth it.  That's just the thing.  You don't get to use it  all year round up here 
[00:06:30]  in New York.  No.  It's a very limited time,  so when your boat's up  getting repaired,  especially if you gotta  take it out of the water,  Oh, forget it.  It's just weeks  where, yeah,  I'm not using the boat anymore.  Right.  That's it.  Right.  It's fucked.  Yeah.  So I didn't get to do much  of anything outside,  no hanging out,  so it was inside  watching shit television.  I gotta address something  with the TV.  This true TV channel 
[00:07:00]  is the worst thing  on television.  There's a couple of shows  that I don't mind  watching on it.  Those shocking videos  where they show,  you know,  cops tasing people  and shit.  Love those.  Love those.  Those are real,  even though they do  enhance the sound.  You know,  it's always the same guy  in the helicopter.  He's making a turn  on L Street there.  The police seem to be  pursuing this guy.  It's like,  wow,  you're the helicopter guy  in every helicopter 
[00:07:30]  in every city.  It's just a voiceover  that he does.  Yeah,  I've heard that  before they do that  just so you know.  Do cops really know  if you're on L Street  from that high?  Well,  they would,  but it's not the guy.  It's the same voice  in every city.  It's like,  and then in Detroit  it was this,  and here he is,  and he seems to be giving  too accurate  a play-by-play.  It's like,  oh,  if he keeps going  at this rate,  he's going to wreck.  And he wrecks.  And he wrecks.  And it's just 
[00:08:00]  the same voice.  They put in  like screeches.  I've heard sound effects  we've used on this show.  That's never good.  They use that one.  Everyone uses that one.  They use the police.  You would think  someone out there  would come up  with a new car screech  sound effect  that we could all use.  And they use like,  here he is.  The police are hot  on his tail now  and the fire,  the fire department  is in on it.  And here comes  a semi.  Oh no,  what are we going to do?  And we're in Europe now. 
[00:08:30]  We're in Europe.  And always in the water.  True TV stinks.  True TV stinks.  I don't mind watching that.  And that's like  the only thing.  It stinks because  there's not a lot  of reality going on.  When they say  true reality,  not reality,  actuality,  I finally realized  I went,  actuality is not a word.  Actuality is making a movie.  It's not a word.  So it's like,  they say not reality,  so they get away with it,  I think.  Because actuality sounds 
[00:09:00]  like it's even more real.  It's even more right.  Right.  But it's actual.  Actual.  It's not a word.  Actuality does sound  realer than reality.  But it's not.  It's a garbage.  It's fake.  It's fake.  So now,  God.  The first inkling  I got of this  was years ago  when that Operation Repo show  came on.  Right.  And I gotta say  these rubes,  these idiots  that would email  or tweet  or fucking,  however they get  in touch with you,  would say like,  you gotta check this out. 
[00:09:30]  It's cool as shit.  Last night,  this fat fuck  did this  and he started  busting his car apart.  The second I put it on,  I'm thinking,  who are the retards?  That really think  this is happening.  That this is an  honest,  real show.  It's so fake.  The position  of the camera people,  like the camera guy  watches them  repo a vehicle  and then  everyone drives away  and the two angry  people are standing there  that got their car repoed 
[00:10:00]  going,  oh,  I can't believe  they took my car.  They wouldn't turn  and go,  hey,  camera guy,  who are these fucks?  Or beat the fuck  out of the camera guy.  Of course.  He's not invisible.  And then,  next thing you know,  the camera guy's  back in the vehicles  with the guys  that repoed the car.  How did that happen?  They come back  and pick him up?  So instantly,  you know that show  is bullshit.  And then,  so I've been watching  for a little while.  You pop on a show  called Pawn Stars 
[00:10:30]  and that's real.  It's a pawn shop  and people go in  and see what they got  and they assess it  and see if they want  to sell it.  And that one's authentic.  I've watched that show.  But True TV  has to have a show  all called  Hardcore Pawn  that is in Detroit  and I don't doubt  that a couple of,  in a couple of instances  per episode,  real people are coming in  because it is a real pawn shop  and trying to pawn something 
[00:11:00]  or sell something.  And the people are,  obviously know  they're on camera  and they're being  overly dramatic  and shit like that.  But I think it's  an authentic transaction.  But then there's  the street ghetto blacks  that come in  trying to sell like,  I've got some VCR!  Get the fuck out of here.  And the guy goes,  I can't give that to you.  And then the woman's like,  why don't you take that?  We need money  to get LaToya out of prison. 
[00:11:30]  And it's like this  over the top,  if I was any black organization,  that's the show  I'd go after.  Because it's really  just this bullshit.  And it's all about  stereotyping.  And it always ends  with the chick  like grabbing the thing,  the VCR,  and smashing it  on the floor.  And they're big security guys  like ushering  the people out.  And at one point  I saw they were trying  to grab this woman  and drag her out.  And the back of her shirt  lifted up  to reveal a clip-on 
[00:12:00]  square wireless mic.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like, we're going to  have an argument with you.  But let's make sure  we get good sound.  Yeah, we've got to  get good sound.  So once we throw you out.  Lift up your shirt  so we can put the mic pack on you.  As you're grabbing it  and pulling it on the floor  on the way out.  But can we have  our wireless backpack?  You know,  the one we wired you up with.  And it's not even so much  that they're doing that  because any asshole  will go tune in  and go,  this sucks  and not tune in.  But it's the people  that fucking Twitter,  you've got to see this. 
[00:12:30]  It's so much better  than the other porn shows  because like  these crazy  black Detroit people  come in  and try to sell things  and it gets all crazy.  And it's obvious  that it's fake.  What kind of retard are you?  Wait,  is the original porn show  on the same network?  No.  Of course not.  The original porn show  is on History Channel.  So they basically  stole a fucking idea.  They're notorious  for doing that,  by the way.  Made a corny,  hardcore porn.  Right.  Oh, I fucking hate them. 
[00:13:00]  And there's always  a problem between  the employees  where we're all family.  So it's like  the son has a problem  with the dad  which came from  the, you know,  the bike show.  The son has a problem  with the dad  and they're yelling  about how much he,  money he gave  this person  that came in  for some piece of shit.  And it's like,  so last night  I was just watching a little.  I sat there  fucking watching  and just pointing out  all the fake shit  that was going on.  And that, 
[00:13:30]  it's all this  true TV crap shows  where they advertise it  and it's like,  watch this shitty  fucking show.  And three guys  are standing there  and then they gotta  fold their arms  and not their head.  We mean business.  We own a pawn shop.  Yeah, we're crazy.  Watch out for us.  We're gonna repo your car.  We're folding our arms  and we're,  our head's shaved.  We're folding.  And we're nodding.  We're folding our arms  to make our biceps  look bigger.  Yeah, look out.  New season coming up. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, God.  True TV stinks.  It's still worse.  And it used to be,  I guess,  Court TV.  Which was good.  Which was good  if you wanted to tune in  and now watch an actual trial  or shit like that.  You turned me off  of True TV,  but it's,  I don't know,  time is weird  when you do this radio show.  It's gotta be over  a year ago now  when we started talking about,  I think it was  the Repo show.  Operation Repo.  And then that's when  I realized  I'm not even gonna try  this True TV anymore.  It's completely scripted.  I went to, 
[00:14:30]  and then at the beginning  when I was watching  that Operation Repo  and knew it was fake,  I wanted to see  if other people like,  I was begging,  please,  other people,  please be with me.  Please,  whole earth,  don't be stupid.  So,  I went online  and put in,  you know,  Operation Repo fake,  and then you get  a bunch of websites  and blogs  and message boards,  so I went there,  and there was actually  an episode  where they showed  the big fat lead guy  trying to roust somebody 
[00:15:00]  out of the vehicle,  and he started getting  chest pains,  and the ambulance came,  and it was like,  again,  like the WWF ambulance,  you know,  those fake fucking people,  a cop car that just says  police on the side,  and they just threw  an oxygen mask on him.  That wasn't attached  to anything?  It wasn't attached  to anything,  and he's sitting there,  and then the season ended  with him going,  he was,  and it said he was  taken to the hospital  with chest pains,  we'll give you more info,  like, 
[00:15:30]  in the future,  and some adult  actually wrote a post  that said,  how could they end  the season  where we don't know  if he's going to be  okay or not?  We watch all season  and start liking  these characters,  these people,  not even characters,  and we didn't know  if he was okay.  Shame on you.  And I'm thinking,  of course he's okay,  this is fake!  You just described  Grey's Anatomy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, 
[00:16:00]  wait for the fucking  cliffhanger.  You want to talk about  a horse shit show,  but anyway, go ahead.  It's terrible, right?  Yeah, it's just...  Well, because everything  has to be...  Sorry,  let me...  No, it's just...  It's on a roll here.  No, it was just that...  We'll talk about  Grey's Anatomy  another day.  I'm pretty much done,  but all I...  It's not even so much  that they put fake shows on,  because you know what?  People watch  these fucking things.  It's that I have,  again,  again,  it's reinforced  my hatred  and disappointment  in humanity  that they watch this 
[00:16:30]  and think it's real  and tweet  that you gotta watch this.  It's so good.  And there's a big gap  between every once in a while  and maybe getting tricked  by a YouTube video  or a break.com video.  Like that shoe video  yesterday on the subway?  Right.  I'm starting to think...  I think we started  saying it yesterday.  I think it's a fake video  that someone is trying  to get a viral video out there,  but you're not really sure.  I'm not sure.  But this shit,  as soon as you watch it,  you're very sure  that a lot of it 
[00:17:00]  is made up  and scripted  and there's actors  involved and stuff,  but it's amazing  how many people,  like you said,  are buying into it,  which is really disappointing.  And if you use your pause  on your DVR  and read the disclaimers  at the beginning  and end...  It tells you right there,  right?  It tells you...  What does it say  in the beginning?  ...that it's scripted  fucking reality  and it's...  Or they use those words  like actuality, so...  Recreations of  similar events,  things like that.  Catchphrases.  And it's always like 
[00:17:30]  a big boudel,  as they say.  A big boudel.  It's always some big drama  going on.  They never just hook a car up  and take it away.  Like every fucking  where they go,  there's a problem.  And they got the big  shaved head guy  that crosses his arms  and he's always talking like,  hey, I try to keep  the situation calm  until, you know,  the guy realizes  he doesn't want his car repoed  so he takes it apart  with a tire iron.  Yeah, I'm sure that happens  all the time.  It's great.  They're thinking  Mike Epps' car. 
[00:18:00]  What new nonsense?  I hate the fact  that true is spelled  without a fucking E.  Ah, see?  Oh, there's your first clue.  Because it's not true.  Right.  Yeah.  That's probably a good way.  Not reality, actuality.  What's he doing?  Oh, he's doing some  wacky Michael Jackson dance  and he kicked the guy  in the butt.  This is wrestling  like you just said.  Yeah.  He does Michael Jackson  dance moves  while he's trying  to fight the repo guys.  A couple crotch grabs  and then kicks him  in the butt. 
[00:18:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  It's horrible.  This channel does suck.  And people think  it's real.  Well, look at that.  This video is so horribly  scripted and lame  but it has 1.3 million views.  What is it?  Proving your fucking point.  Why?  I would never watch this.  No.  Most of those people  are watching this  because they really  think it was real.  Ugh.  And now he's walking  around like Michael Jackson  because his car  is being repoed.  And then they  interview the repo team.  They go to like,  you know, 
[00:19:00]  behind the scenes  and they're like,  I couldn't believe it  when it was happening.  He just started dancing  like a crazy person.  Really?  Did he?  Really?  Mm-hmm.  And he was fine  with the cameras  and...  Mm-hmm.  He signed the release.  Yeah, he signed the release  because his face  isn't pixelated out  or anything.  Like, he's dancing more.  Look, look.  He's moonwalking.  And people sit there  going,  this is great.  He's moonwalking  and crying  because his car  is being taken away.  And it looks like 
[00:19:30]  that's not his car  like a tow truck  had to pull that  into the driveway  because it looks like  it doesn't even run  because it's sort of  a DeLorean, right?  It's like a DeLorean.  Like a knockoff DeLorean.  I don't even think  it had license plates on it.  Watch Operation Repo.  Not reality,  actuality.  We got a guy  that does repos,  watch the Repo show,  it's nothing like that.  Of course not.  In the middle of the night,  you're fucking  hitching cars up  and praying  that you don't get shot at.  Yeah.  That's the real Repo. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, that's Repo.  Right, Keith?  Yeah, when I go out there,  man, we have a spotter  and that guy,  we drop them off  and keep driving.  That guy goes  and checks the VIN number,  he calls us back,  that truck is prepared  and ready around the corner.  I don't care if it's in park,  if the wheels are cut,  I'll drag that car a mile  until I'm safe.  Yeah.  It's such a horse shit.  How many times have you repoed,  hold on,  how many times have you repoed a car  in the middle of the day,  bright sunlight?  No, never.  Exactly.  It's always at night, right? 
[00:20:30]  Always at night.  In the middle of the night  when people are sleeping.  I've watched documentaries  on actual Repo guys  and it's exactly what he's saying.  They drop someone off,  they check the VIN number,  they make sure that  there's a,  it's the real car.  And a lot of these companies  own these trucks.  You could back the fucking truck up,  lift the fucking car up,  and drive away within seconds  with that fucking car  on the back.  That's 30 seconds most amount.  30 seconds.  And then,  and then, 
[00:21:00]  don't you get another guy  that does knock on the door  and inform the people  that the car has been taken  and here's how they can  get it back  or get their goods out of it  and shit?  Fuck that.  I leave a business card  in the door.  All right.  Yeah, exactly.  Who the fuck would knock  on the door?  Good for you.  Wait, what kind of,  you have a different  than a typical tow truck?  Yeah, we pick them up  out of tires.  These guys are so fucking cheap.  They use it,  it's called the fling  where they back up underneath it.  If you've got a Corvette 
[00:21:30]  or something,  you're ripping the bumper off.  You can't even pick  the fucking car up.  Oh, so the show is cheap  and they don't even use  the real Repo vehicles?  They're causing more damage  than anybody using  that shitty equipment they use.  It's all fake.  That big guy,  why the fuck does he  fall on the ground  the second you touch him  and start holding his head?  I mean, the fucking guy  got to be 6'3", 260.  Yeah.  It's so fucking fake.  Listen, not to change it,  but one more.  That's Southern Fried Sting.  That's another fucking bullshit show.  Check that one out, too.  That was fake. 
[00:22:00]  Another one was the bait car.  Can we get the list of shows?  Oh, bait car.  Why do they,  there's so much reality.  Why do they have to make fake reality?  There's enough real stuff,  like cops and that.  Because the lawyers got involved  with reality programming, I bet.  Maybe, yeah.  So you can't really do it anymore,  so you've got to fake do it.  It's also...  I guarantee that  it has something to do with it.  And I've watched documentaries  on bait cars.  On cops,  they've done some of the sting operations. 
[00:22:30]  On other cop shows,  you see real bait car footage.  And it's nothing like  the show Bait Car.  Or the other one  where the guy's going around  and it's even just  making traffic tickets,  writing tickets,  parking...  There's a parking meter  reality show that's fake.  And everybody's always  got a problem.  Oh, fuck you!  Beep, beep, beep!  Beep, you!  Beep, beep!  Really?  Really?  Well, it's cable.  They could leave it in.  Yeah.  It's all crap.  By the way,  I would never...  What a smart guy is  not reality, actuality 
[00:23:00]  to pick that up.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  It gives them an out right there.  They're not lying.  It's, uh...  Parking Wars?  Parking Wars.  Yeah, that's another one  that's just...  Is that the one out of Philly?  Or is that the...  I've seen one out of Philly,  Parking Wars.  But is that on True TV?  Probably.  Because the one out of Philly,  that was kind of entertaining.  I don't know if it's on True TV  or True TV's doing their own version of that.  I've only seen one episode of that.  But I like, like, watching things like  Forensic Files  and cool shows that are on there 
[00:23:30]  because there's a couple of good ones.  But any of those, like,  phony fucking bullshit.  Oh, here's another crap.  Party heat.  Wet, wild, and under arrest.  Underage flashing.  Boys do cry.  What is this one?  I guess this is, uh...  Cops that patrol the beaches  during spring break and shit.  Oh, so this is real.  Or Arizona.  Uh, they, they, uh...  Go to, uh...  Spring break there. 
[00:24:00]  No, I don't think this is real either.  But it's True TV, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's True TV.  It's actuality.  They leave the E off for what?  Yeah.  So it can't say True.  Yeah, so it's...  It's like TRU.  That don't mean shit.  Oh, these girls look like  they're fucking...  Down for some action.  Yeah, what is this?  She's flashing?  This is Daytona Beach.  Where's your identification, ladies?  Daytona Beach.  All right, run, yeah.  Hey, what are you doing? 
[00:24:30]  Leave that girl alone.  She's got beads around her neck.  Oh, yeah.  These girls look kind of fake.  And if she's underage,  why are they showing her face?  And they all...  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you...  The entire group,  not one of them  had a pixelated face,  so that means they...  Every single person  signed a release.  Everyone's signed a release.  And even if an underage girl  signs a release,  you can't put her on fucking TV  if she's being arrested.  It doesn't matter.  I wonder if these are actors  or real people  if they just say  to do this scenario. 
[00:25:00]  Maybe both.  I don't know how  these bullshit shows work,  but...  Yeah, they would be  pixelating everything there.  I'd watch this  just for the fucking...  Oh, yeah, of course.  There's some nice ass...  Why are you complaining  about this?  Yeah, Party Heat...  What's wrong with you?  Party Heat has some watchability.  Okay, good.  Not for the fucking...  Kids are fucked.  They're all actresses.  Yeah.  You see those bikinis?  Yeah.  All right.  Party Heat.  Party Heat rules.  I think I love true TV now. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, man.  Yep.  Yeah, so that's...  That's probably...  That's pretty much  what I spent doing yesterday  is just watching bullshit shows  and getting angry.  I don't know why, too.  I just start...  I'm in my house going,  Look at this bullshit!  I just start yelling.  Because too many people  are buying into it.  I guess that's what frustrates you.  Yeah, that is the frustrating part.  Because I do get tweets  from people that just say,  Dude, if you're into that,  then you've got to watch this  because it's so much better.  And then you watch it  and realize, 
[00:26:00]  Who's the dummy?  Sometimes I actually do  go back to the tweet  and say,  What are you retarded?  Or blind?  And then block him.  Very good at it.  Actuality.  I like to pride myself  on a man who picks apart slogans.  Of course, yes.  Picks apart a good slogan.  What I'm surprised at  is how fake the action is, though.  It's so fake.  I mean, if you want to fake some shit, 
[00:26:30]  I think you can get better actors  and better writers  and make it a little more believable.  I mean, to have a guy  doing Michael Jackson dance moves  and people buying into that  is a...  Maybe they realize  people will just buy into it.  They've run out of...  Maybe we're the stupid ones.  ...anything  that is near reality  that would be entertaining.  You know what, Ed?  So they just make this shit up.  I gotta turn this on you.  We're the stupid ones.  I just figured it out.  These people are brilliant.  They know what...  They know what people  are gonna fucking buy into. 
[00:27:00]  And they realize  they don't have to try too hard.  That's right.  They realize  a dumb Michael Jackson asshole  grabbing his crotch  and moonwalking  and then kicking a guy.  People are gonna buy into it.  Oh, that's great.  Just see that guy.  So we're the stupid ones.  That's what...  Well, that's what I said.  I go, I don't blame them  for putting on shitty fake shows.  But I blame fucking people  for being so stupid  that they buy into this garbage.  It's bullshite.  I say bullshite.  Hey, there was...  To change subjects,  there was a lot of action  in the neighborhood yesterday. 
[00:27:30]  In the neighborhood there?  I saw some pictures of...  Looked like some kind of a wreck.  Yeah, we've talked about the shoe.  Yes, the shoe.  Oh, boy.  Every time there's a car accident,  you'll see a shoe.  You know, people get knocked  out of their shoes.  And I don't really understand that.  Did a Mythbusters do the shoe episode?  I think they did, right?  They did something called  Knock Your Socks Off.  Yeah.  Where they wanted to see  if you could be punched  or even hit by a car  out of your socks or shoes.  And depending on the right combo,  yeah, you can.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  I've seen it.  I've seen videos  of getting knocked out of their shoes  on fucking that chaotic site  or whatever.  Yeah.  You'll see a person get hit  and then there's the old shoes-a-roo.  Well, it's one of Newton's  most popular laws, you know.  An object at rest  will remain at rest.  Object in motion  will stay in motion  unless, of course,  something gets in its way.  And that's what happens.  Your mass of you  is separate than the mass  of your shoes  and anything else you wear. 
[00:28:30]  So if you get hit,  your energy,  the energy that's in you,  the kinetic energy,  is going to push you.  And meanwhile,  your shoes,  for that split second,  aren't moving.  Right.  And you will be knocked out of them.  I get that.  Yeah.  Sort of.  Because you just explained it to me.  I didn't get it before that.  Yeah.  I'll be honest.  But when your shoes are tight...  By the way,  that was a great way  to tell on yourself  because to say,  I get that,  sounds like,  yeah,  we're on the same page,  but you don't have to  just snitch on yourself.  No, I understand something  when someone explains it to me, 
[00:29:00]  but I didn't know that  until this very moment.  I didn't either.  But when your shoes  are tied on tight,  that's where you lose me.  It would have to be  really tight.  Because I like to keep  tied around your ankle,  like up top.  Because if you could,  put it this way,  if you could take your shoes off  with your other foot,  you know how you do that.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  You put your toe near your heel  and knock your shoes off,  then your shoes can fly off your feet.  Here's the deal.  There's two things I hate doing.  I don't like combing my hair.  I haven't done it in decades. 
[00:29:30]  And I don't like tying my shoes.  I'll maybe tie my shoes once a month.  And every once in a while,  I'll tie them.  You just slide into them?  Yeah.  And every once in a while,  I'll tie my shoes a little too tight,  so I can't do what you just said.  Right.  It's like really hard  to get my shoes off.  And I know people tie their shoes  even tighter than that.  Yeah.  But their shoes will fall off  if they get hit by a car.  I still don't get it.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  It is an amazing phenomenon. 
[00:30:00]  But yesterday,  Roland lives in the neighborhood,  so I take a lot of walks with him and stuff.  And yesterday,  he ran into Michael Douglas.  So if he's here,  he's got to tell his Michael Douglas story.  He tweeted the picture.  Yeah.  He sent me a copy of it.  I just wrote back,  die.  I was so annoyed  that he met Michael Douglas.  That is a biggie, right?  I hope we understand him today  because his Michael Douglas meeting  was very strange.  I think we did some Michael Douglas.  And then he writes me  and says there was a huge accident 
[00:30:30]  on 72nd and Columbus.  How did you know?  Oh, it was written.  Okay.  I thought he said it.  So we went up to the accident site  and this fucking car  went on the sidewalk,  hit four people,  and I tweeted a picture of a shoe.  But that shoe could have  easily fallen off, obviously.  But there's always a shoe  left behind at accidents.  Shoes and accidents?  Ah, yes.  I don't even know  what happens to the people.  I hope they're all right.  I don't wish harm on anyone,  but fuck.  Some people.  Some people, you're right, actually. 
[00:31:00]  Actually, it's the same principle  as pulling a tablecloth  out from under dishes  on a table.  You're still trying  to explain this to me?  Well, it's the same principle  behind it.  But if it's on tight,  how does it get around your ankle  and your toes  and everything else?  Well, there's a lot of energy  jamming you forward  and the shoe wants to stay there  and your body wants to move.  Yeah, but doesn't your body  just drag the shoe with it  because your toes are in there?  Well, it's such a weird thing  with physics 
[00:31:30]  in that the shoe wants to stay  in one place  regardless of you moving.  Right.  And there will be,  if there is enough  what would be friction  between your foot and the shoe,  then that will overcome  the inertia in the shoe  which is holding the shoe in place.  Right.  And then you have your shoes with you.  But if there's so much energy  in your body,  you'll be thrown right out of your shoes. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, it's...  It's fucked up.  It is strange.  But there are always shoes in the road  from people that have just been flung.  It's bizarre.  Roland, explain your Michael Douglas sighting.  Oh, it just says it's up front.  There's tons of celebrities  on the Upper West Side now.  So I just went walking  through Central Park  saw an old gentleman...  In the very, merry month of May.  Don't steal that. 
[00:32:30]  I got that one.  I got this down.  I've hung out long enough  to know this one.  Then I just saw a group of people  talking to this guy  and then I just overheard his voice.  Then they were taking pictures.  I look up as Michael Douglas.  He's talking about Endicott's steal?  No, then he started walking by himself  and I just went up to him,  I knew the manager,  like, hey, how are you?  And then he goes,  walked with me for a few blocks  and just talked for a few minutes.  I asked for a picture  and gave me a hug,  took a picture. 
[00:33:00]  I said, oh, my mom loves you.  And he goes, give her my best.  Why would he want to walk with you?  I don't know.  I knew the same people he knew.  I hope he knows why.  I hope he nailed this one.  Why he wanted to walk and talk with him.  Because Michael Douglas is like,  holy shit, I should be dead  and I'm alive.  He should be dead.  I'm alive.  He is walking around  with a gusto.  The colors look a lot brighter.  Right.  A lot brighter.  The air is fresher.  He was whistling  when he was walking.  He's talking with people like Roland.  When someone asks him for a picture, 
[00:33:30]  he's never saying no.  Either that  or he wanted a blowjob from Roland.  That's why he was in the park.  I'm in the park.  Didn't you say that  before he took the picture  he wanted to know  a little bit about you?  Yeah, he just says,  so what about yourself?  Unless you saw death.  I know Roland  that I'm not interested in him.  Right.  That is a joy to be alive.  When you've stared  at the Grim Reaper,  Roland looks like a treat.  Didn't he have stage four?  Yeah, he was in bed.  Stage four throat cancer? 
[00:34:00]  And he can still talk.  He's not even like,  he actually looks healthy now, man.  Yeah.  He was super nice  and you just see him  wave to people  and maybe he's in  the happiest guy in the world.  Maybe he's in that place  where they don't know  if it's going to be  fucking close to God.  Who knows?  Right.  Roland may help AIDS babies  off the train.  Never know.  And, uh,  yeah, so you met  Michael Douglas.  That's pretty cool.  That's a good one.  And then,  and then you sort of  heard the car accident  on 72nd and Columbus, right?  Yeah, I was ordering  dinner at the Harding Room.  Oh, what's that? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, it must be an accident.  Let me go see you.  Roland probably caused it.  He probably yelled,  Michael Douglas  and somebody went where?  It's somebody else.  I turned him on  to my favorite fucking place  to eat in all  What glory hole is this?  The West Side.  Just a dumb  little chicken plate  better than any  fucking restaurant  I eat at.  Do I know where it is?  12 bucks.  Kenny Rogers Roasters.  I'm not saying where it is.  Do I know where it is?  I don't want to line  out the door.  Out the door.  I'll tell you secretly.  But you were there  getting a chicken plate 
[00:35:00]  and then this fucking  accident happened, huh?  Yeah, they just went outside  and, ooh, free show.  Were there people  all over the place?  One guy goes,  they hit four people  and he's like,  one guy this way,  one woman that way.  You had a guy in the middle  going,  what do you want from me?  Do they look dead  or they looked all right?  I know.  They call my number  so I get back  and get my food.  Oh, food more important.  Of course,  that's way more important  than seeing if human beings  are dead right in front of you.  What the hell's wrong with you?  It seems okay.  There are ambulances  and people there  to take care of.  That was a good one.  Ambulances.  What amazes me 
[00:35:30]  about living in New York  is the amount  of fucking cars  that end up on sidewalks  and buildings?  How is that possible  when there's red lights  every fucking hundred feet?  I don't get it.  I guess because  there is a very limited space  between the edge of the street  and a building.  You know,  it's not like  a country road.  You could fuck up  and be like,  knock down some mailboxes,  drive through people's backyards.  Sure.  But the city,  it's like,  if you fuck up,  you're pretty much  on the sidewalk  and then there's people 
[00:36:00]  all over the sidewalks  all the time  and then a building  is a mere few feet  away from that.  Within a four block area  of where I live  in the last,  a little over a year,  probably a year and a half,  four major cars  going off the road accidents.  One taking out  a whole fucking side  of a bank.  And what,  did you know  the ethnic  or age makeup  of the people  that have a problem?  Because when you see it  on the news, though.  Because thank God  I don't see it live.  I'm always on the scene  after the fact.  On the news, though, 
[00:36:30]  they always say like  an elderly woman  or an elderly man  said the car  took off on them.  And meanwhile,  you know,  they just plastered  that big old foot  down on the skinny pedal.  No, I got a theory.  It's actually,  a lot of the cabbies  end up in buildings  and on the sidewalks.  Oh, thank God.  And the reason is  because they're so aggressive  to get fares.  Yeah.  So they're doing  some crazy shit  to try to beat  the other cab  that's right next to them.  And so they're cutting  all the way over  and stuff like that. 
[00:37:00]  And then that guy  has to make a move  to avoid the cab  and they're going  off the road.  They're very aggressive.  Yep.  Because, you know,  people aren't taking  cabs as much  because they raised  their rates to the point  where they took  some of their  fucking clientele  out of the picture.  I don't give them  a fucking inch,  those cocksuckers.  They're terrible.  Not an inch.  And they get so pissed.  And my whole excuse is  you're not going to be  going faster than me.  Right.  You're going to  fucking stop for a fare.  You're going to stop  at a light 
[00:37:30]  and when the light  turns green  you're going to  still be there  until I beat  my fucking horn  doing your dumb  paperwork  with your stupid  dome light on  as they're writing.  Fuck them.  Fuck them  and their living.  Please.  If every single  one of them  turned into the river  I would applaud.  I hate cab drivers.  Them and I got to say  also  and I know  we probably got  a lot of fans  Blacks and Jews. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  Exactly.  And women.  Them too.  They could all  You said Jews wrong.  The garbage truck drivers.  The fucking garbage truck drivers.  They're terrible.  Can fuck themselves.  Yeah.  They run  and I look  I know they got a job to do  they got to pick up the garbage  but you know what  I got a job to do  and I got to get to it  and these motherfuckers  are amongst the worst drivers  they don't give a fuck  where they are  where they stop  they'll stop in the middle  of the block 
[00:38:30]  when there's plenty of room  not to.  And then fucking  you know  Julio will get off the back  and start throwing the garbage in  and it's like  really?  You had to stop  in the middle of the fucking road  and now I'm stuck here  behind you?  Shouldn't they be  a little more humble  considering they're picking up garbage?  Yeah.  You're picking up garbage  and the driver  the shooting from the right side  across five lanes  of fucking traffic  to make the turn  you want to  fucking kill them.  It's like I understand  and it's like  they get away with it  because everybody knows 
[00:39:00]  they have a hard job  and they are  unnecessary  very necessary function  but a lot of times  when they'll leave  the ass into that truck  sticking out  because they don't want  to walk an extra ten feet  I fucking cannot stomach  when they do that.  And the driver  doesn't want to  pull over enough  to let traffic through  so you just sit there.  Well you got an insight  on this Dan?  Well a little bit  I used to do this  like ten years ago.  Oh you did?  You were a garbage man?  Yeah for private sanitation.  Ah yeah that's the  mob run one. 
[00:39:30]  Kinda yeah.  Yeah I know that  Long Island.  I understand it pisses  everybody off  some of the stuff  that garbage guys do  but at the same time  it's like when you're  throwing trash  for like 11-12 hours  a night man  anything that you  could do to cut  a corner or two  it saves  because you got to  do it all over again  the next day  it's tough  it's really really  physically demanding.  That's their fucking job  and you know what  to get in the fucking way  and nearly cause accidents  what time are we  talking about?  Oh so this is 
[00:40:00]  pretty early in the morning  yeah cause we would  do overnights too  so we would be  pretty early in the  fucking morning  all night long  and in order to  completely block someone  at five in the morning  is a talent  you really gotta be  across every lane  of fucking traffic  yeah but you know what  you guys block the garbage  sometimes too  so we have to walk  around a car  oh I don't mind  if you fucking  walk around a car  beat the shit out  of the fucking car  drag garbage over it  I don't care about that  if you part  if there's a pile of garbage  like a pyramid  of garbage bags 
[00:40:30]  and you park your car there  guess what's gonna happen  garbage bags will be  sliding across the  the roof and hood  for it to get to the truck  no don't think for a second  that garbage man  is gonna walk around  your car to place  gently the bag  into the hopper  no I believe you  and fuck that  fuck that car guy  I agree  you should see  some of the condition  we've left people's cars in  just smeared with  banana peeling condoms  there's like a hundred bags  and you park right  in front of the thing  we'll purposely  we used to  allegedly  prop bags  that we knew 
[00:41:00]  were just full of shit  and gross  Vietnamese restaurant  dripping  and run the hopper  right in the middle  of the bag  so that all the pressure  just bursts the bag  like a fucking  like a paper bag  like a balloon  and it would just  shoot out  onto the windshield  onto someone's  brand new car washed car  go fuck yourself  but what if they  parked there  before the garbage  went out  like earlier that day  I didn't know  you should pay attention  to the garbage collection  I don't think  it probably  they probably wouldn't  have parked there  before the garbage  got there  plus it's all like  you know  private sanitation  is mostly commercial  garbage  so it's mostly 
[00:41:30]  in commercial  restaurants and stuff  like that  so you should know  yeah you shouldn't  be  this guy  Daniel in Jersey  Daniel  welcome aboard Dan  hey guys  Jimmy you were saying  before that  these people should  be a little  garbage  yes I was making  a joke  because Ant was saying  how arrogant they were  yes  because I've heard  that they actually  make a shitload  of money  you know  especially during  the winter time  whenever it snows  yeah  overtime that they pull in  and there's actually  a pretty long waiting list  to become a New York 
[00:42:00]  City sanitation  they actually do  make good money  which kind of removes  the pity factor  yeah yeah  and you should make  good money  that's a fucking  horrendous thing to do  is get garbage juice  on you  but they do make  good cash  deal with the rats  yeah that's a job  where you should make  a very very good  amount of money  the only good thing  is there's not as many  of those out there  as there are cabs  but I've been stuck  behind garbage trucks  that  or fucking lights  and turns  and everything else  but cabs do it  all the time 
[00:42:30]  a cab will not realize  he should be  in the right  or left lane  when the arrow  is there  for the right  or left turn  so he'll block  the straight lane  of course  it's just  it's every  fucking day  you gotta deal  with these  these moron  savages  you realize  that like  you're sitting here  going  fuck these guys  they're in my way  but at the same time  they're in their car  or garbage truck  going fuck that guy  he's in my way  well you know what  but they're causing  the problems  they're like  if there's a cab 
[00:43:00]  and he's in the  go straight lane  and he wants to  make a left turn  and the left arrow  comes up  but the go straight  is still red  and now no one  can go straight  cause he's sitting  there in the  go straight lane  and now he's realizing  he's gotta make a turn  so he's fucked  everyone behind him  that wants to go straight  fuck him  he knows he's in the  wrong lane  me  I'm over  to the right  or left  depending on where  I'm going  and when I  fucking can get  around those  motherfuckers  I stop  and just  fucking 
[00:43:30]  lambast  I  I throw out  every racial  epithet  things about  his mother  things I know  that  that certain  cultures  don't like to hear  you know  I'm very  cultural based  in my insult  you fucked  their wife  yes yes  shit like that  I'll fuck  your wife  yes yes  your hairy  fucking wife  just shit like that  where you know  it's a culture  thing  where they don't  want  I've seen  yeah  I've seen  your wife's  pussy  I've seen  her fucking 
[00:44:00]  stinky pussy  and you know  that their wives  are all wrapped  up and  and they're  very like  oh my god  you should  respect that  oh yeah  oh yeah  I'm very ethnic  based in my insult  I go for the  A-bomb  every time  I don't get as  mad at a garbage  truck if I see  that that garbage  truck had no  choice  like sometimes  when a garbage  truck puts his  nose in somewhere  or whatever  or backs his  ass ended  and they're  doing garbage  and you see  that there's  cars parked  and literally  a truck  couldn't have  stopped  anywhere else  I'm not as  mad  like alright  there's nothing 
[00:44:30]  else they can  do  the garbage  has to be  picked up  it's only  when they  could do  something  literally  ten feet  away  or five  feet away  and they  don't care  that everyone's  backed up  that's what  fucking makes  me angry  he has another  fucking piss off  move though  that I love  that cabs do  especially in front  of the building  in the morning  right  yes  they  let's say  there's a parking  space and there's  limited parking  spaces  there's a parking  space and there's  limited parking  spaces  well I said  let's  that's everybody  please  and I could have 
[00:45:00]  parked there  but a cab is  dropping someone off  or waiting to  pick someone up  they don't pull  into the spot  they double park  in front of  an open parking  space  thus wasting  the parking  space because  if you're going  to double park  why not just  double park  next to a car  that's already  parked there  right  he's not leaving  the vehicle  he's not leaving  it there  so if some guy  comes out  and needs to  move  the cab can  then move  but he'll  double park  in front of 
[00:45:30]  an open space  fucking you over  not allowing you  to park in that  spot  now double park  in front of a car  that's already there  I'm just amazed  you run into so many  problems so early  in the morning  every morning  I'm amazed by that  I believe you  every day  but I'm amazed  by that  there's no one  in Manhattan  everyone's commuting  there's still  there's still no one  in Manhattan  right now  that's why I got  that contour camera  just amazing  oh boy  oh boy  strap that fucker  right to my head  and we are going  to have a treat

[00:53:30]  with the tape  it's like  why do you have  a tape  you can get  like 32 gigs  on a fucking  Uncle Paul  and then put it  oh on a chip  sorry  I may have a  I may have a camera  but it's a Sony  which is so fucking hard  but it has a hard drive  oh the old hard drive one  those are even fucking  you don't need it  now it's just USB  or  SD  SD chip  you fucking put it in  and you could put  a USB in there  and you don't have 
[00:54:00]  to take the  what's that  out  you could just  plug it right  into the computer  no one's fucked up  and the old days  this would have been  a two hour rant  today it's a 30 second rant  we're so fucking  motivated  but this company  just  will  will let us  just fucking  rot here  but we will move on  from this place  we're obviously  really into  visual shit  oh please  and these assholes  down the hall  can't figure that out  and how to fucking  make it part of the  Opie and Anthony  experience here at  Sirius XM  and make money 
[00:54:30]  out of it  but instead  they'd rather go  into their stupid  offices and let  this show fucking  rot  but Opie and Anthony  and Jim Norton  aren't gonna rot  the show might  fucking rot  at this place  the show might rot  but we're moving  the fuck on from this  because they're not  visionaries as far  as what this show  could be  but we'll have to  sit in that  asshole's office  and he'll go  hey we want a big  event this summer  go fuck yourself  we had big events  that you took away  from us  I'm not gonna  fucking hang out

[01:01:00]  are going to  be doing a show  yes called  you think that  we're columns  tired  it worked  gave me a mental  image  columns in her  face  what's this  ah that one  was talking  on a phone  for 16  fucking hours  in the quiet  car of an  Amtrak  really  this big  fat  um  piggish  fucking  uh  uh  uh  rambunctious  woman 
[01:01:30]  let's just say  she was  rambunctious  why didn't they  just throw off  the car  yeah they  usually  shut you down  they stopped  the fucking  train  the police  came and took  a ride off  the god damn  train  after 16 hours  uh  I guess so  yeah  I can't even  get a minute  before someone  yells at me  it had to get  enough people  had to be like  shut the fuck  up  and now she's  feeling  disrespected  after being  kicked off the  train  so she's  gonna win  the fucking  lottery  no she won't  nah  she won't  talking on the  quiet car  and they asked 
[01:02:00]  you to be  quiet  that fat  pig would  my dignity  was  disrespected  shut up  you heifer  god what's  the problem  lose some  weight  let me see her  the fuck  are you  eating  uh  how  let's  wait  big fat  fuck  just sitting  there  and she  was talking  loudly  Lakeisha  Beard  of  Tiggard  was charged  with disorder  what where  is she from  what a coincidence  oh  uh  where did  it say  16 hours  wow 
[01:02:30]  uh  I'm amazed  on the news  and in  in the story  it says it  somewhere  yeah  uh  had been  the phone  non-stop  since the  train pulled  out of  Oakland  16 hours  earlier  Lakeisha  Beard  what a  fat pig  Oakland  figures  good battery  life  yeah  I would  think  plugged  in  that  should  have  lasted  20  minutes  before  she  was  thrown  out  of  the  car  not even  yeah  what's  she talk  what is  this  fucking  have to 
[01:03:00]  talk about  for 16  fucking  hours  oh  god  people  yeah  but that  that selfish  fat  fuck  is  everything  that's  hateable  about  fucking  personal  freedoms  yeah  I don't know  why I just  said that  but  no it  is  you're  absolutely  right  people  have no  regard  for each  other  none  oh yeah  you're  right  and you  can't  legislate  that  it's like  that's  just the  behavior  of a  selfish  if she  had a  five minute  phone  conversation 
[01:03:30]  because  something  was going  on  that's  one  thing  but that's  just a  selfish  fucking  pig  of  woman  there  are  certain  people  that  just  have  no  fucking  common  sense  no  courtesy  have  these  just  expect  everything  the  blacks  I didn't  say that  that's  why  it was  a  question  certain  people  that was  a  question  mark  yeah  certain  people  did  you  why  did  that  take  16  hours  to get  her  off  that  fucking  train  it's  like  they  probably  told her  they're  probably  afraid  of a  seeming  racist 
[01:04:00]  that's  another  thing  very  good  very  good  yeah  yeah  everyone  probably  kept  their  big  dumb  scaredy  cat  white  fucking  pussy  mouth  shut  well  start  speaking  up  colin  ferguson  would have  handled  that  situation  well  you might  be right  about that  amp  but  we've  all been  in that  quiet  car  and  I mean  the guys  running  the quiet  car  are  brutal  they don't  allow  that  shit  usually  so  who  the  fuck  was in  charge  of the  quiet  car  for  16  hours  don't  be  racist  let  her  talk  she's 
[01:04:30]  had  what  16  hours  after  fucking  you know  hundreds  of  years  of  oppression  right  so  what's  16  hours  we could  deal  with  16  hours  of  this  fucking  useless  piece  of  shit  rambling  on  and  on  about  nothing  if  she  was  you know  all right  yeah  yeah  here's  it  it's  gonna  take  a while  it's  gonna  be  16  hours  but  here's  the  cure  for  AIDS  and  she's  just  telling  you know  the  doctor  on  the  other  end  that  maybe  but  you  know  it  was  just  some

[01:11:00]  it looks good  it doesn't look  good  now what about  what about  when you get  married  when you get  married  and have to  now walk  down the aisle  you've heard  like Montgomery  in Fame  it's fucking  instead of red  it's fucking  light creepy  it's not even  a good color  it's like a  shitty copper  it's like what  Christ's hair  was really like  I'll have long  hair when I get  married  you'll have long  hair when you  get married  yeah  it'll be like  that  name and Bryce  hair really 
[01:11:30]  annoys me  so  why  will you get  a trim  you gotta get  a cut  I mean I might  get the back  of my neck  cleaned up  or something  but I mean  it doesn't  shit with a  fucking machete  you don't even  have to clean  up  I have to  clean up  my fucking  neck  like every  week  well I do  from time  to time  but I mean  my hair's a  mess anyway  so nobody  can tell  if the back  of my neck  needs to be  cleaned up  as long as  you pull it  back  he'll be  alright  no it won't  people are not  gonna like  the fact that  your hair is  like that 
[01:12:00]  well it's the  people it's not  their wedding  is it  aww shit  you know what  and by people  I mean your  your wife to be  probably is not  going to enjoy  the fact that  you're ruining  her day and  her pictures and  everything with  that hair do  she turned the  corner  yeah she doesn't  mind it  she used to  hate his hair  yeah there's  one thing not  minding it when  he's walking  around the house  eating fucking  chicken fingers  but when  you're taking  your vows  you know pledging  your undying  love for someone 
[01:12:30]  until death do  you part  perhaps a more  respectable hairdo  she's in love  with the real  Sam Roberts  this is the real  Sam Roberts  baby take her  to leave it  this is the  package  but we made  the real  Sam Roberts  because you  didn't even  want to grow  your hair  I remember  yeah but  then you've  been asking  me to cut  it for like  two years  so technically  we've been  begging you  yeah what  happened  you created  a monster  is what  happened  and when  was the  last time  he had a  haircut  because we  forgot about  that contest  years ago  is it safe  to say  you're pushing  four years  it must have 
[01:13:00]  been October  2007  really  he hasn't had a  haircut in three  and a half years  you know if you  had a fucking  if you really  wanted to do  something for the  show you'd come  in one day or  you'd let us  shave you  completely bald  luckily I'm not  at that stage  where I want to  do things for the  show anymore  do you know how  great that would  be to go  completely  fucking bald  you're not a  team player  man  and watch your  head roll back  why aren't you  a team player  I was  let us shave  your head  and your pubes  for the show  I think that 10  o'clock hour  should depend  on it  that's right  and your pubes 
[01:13:30]  why the pubes  come into play  did I say that  why the pubes  came into play  there  we want him  to look like  one of those  things walking  off the ship  at the end  of Close Encounters  Afro Wars  started October  18th 2007  so we are  coming up  on four years  holy shit  but I won that  shit didn't I  I guess  yeah well  I don't even know  did we ever  officially name a  winner  I don't think  we did  I don't think  so  one of many  things we  never  played all 
[01:14:00]  the way  through  because now  I like it  that's what  I look like  now  you don't  like it  I do  indeed  how do you  know you  like it  because I  look in the  mirror and  say now  that's a  hairdo  but isn't  it odd  that you  can't really  go anywhere  and you  know look  respectable  I look  respectable  you look  like a  jerk  I put on  a suit  I still  look nice  I went  to Nagel's  wedding  and I  look like  a million  bucks  compared to  who  him  not disrespect 
[01:14:30]  Eric  you  don't hear  those fucking  spats  die  hold on  a minute  you went  to a  wedding  where  Eastside  Dave  tried to  burn  the place  down  as he  was yelling  let's burn  this  motherfucker  down  so the  level  wasn't that  high  as far  as  Kuz  those shoes  should come  with black  and white  water fountains  they were  fucking  horrendous  1950s  my fiance 
[01:15:00]  is trying  to figure  out how  we can  do a  wedding  without  inviting  Eastside  Dave  but it's  not  it's not  a possibility  I don't  think that's  possible  do you want  him there  I do  she doesn't  no  I mean  he'll burn  the  he tried  to light  Eric's  wedding  on fire  literally  like he  put candles  and then he  draped a  table  and then he  started  throwing  furniture  around  tables  and chairs  out of his  fucking mind  I think it was  hilarious  because it  wasn't my  wedding  it was  absolutely  hilarious  I would  imagine  if it  Iraq did  you think  it was  hilarious 
[01:15:30]  or not  no  not at all  of course  not  it started  out fun  and then  went  drastically  bad  you can see  the transition  wow Dave  really  it started  out fun  and then  went  horrifically  bad  Iraq was  filming it  and laughing  as Dave  was singing  Guns N' Roses  like oh  this is great  what a party  my wedding  is  and then all  of a sudden  he sees  Dave drape  a table  cloth  over candles  and he  throws his  camera away  and runs  panicking  then he was  grabbing  chairs  and then  scuffing it  and throwing 
[01:16:00]  them across  the dance  floor  yeah  motherfucker  just yelling  motherfucker  it's a  wedding  what a  jerk  guy's  brilliant  he doesn't  behave himself  yeah shit  it's fun  unless it's  it's not  you  you should  have had  someone  throw him  out  what's wrong  with you  it was  1am  and pretty  much everybody  was leaving  and they  were gone  so there  was just  a handful  of people  chasing  them out  they were  frightened of  a fucking  happy land  social club  incident  the Nagel  family didn't 
[01:16:30]  like Eastside  Dave  no  Eric's dad  did  the Nagel  family liked  Dave  it was  the bride's  family that  was standing  there ready  to kill  him  because they were  in a shitty mood  to begin with  I'm sure  watching her make  the worst mistake  of her life  oh shit  shoes didn't help  how does this  get turned  around on  Eric  come on  I mean  Eric  finally felt  like he was  part of the  team  you think  they turned  it on him  you think  her family  didn't like  his shoes  no I know  yeah they  probably saw  my wedding  day and  they were  like alright  let's make  the best  of this  and then  they saw  the shoes 
[01:17:00]  and like  come on  exactly  oh great  she's marrying  detective  sam slade  I'll tweet  the shoes  later for  everybody  they ruled  they didn't  rule  they did  too  you know  those shoes  needed a  garbage truck  tire mark  on them  they're very  hurtful  you know  Eric's competing  in the  physical fitness  channel  no Eric  is not  yes he is  no he is  not  he is indeed  who's he  competing with  a neutron star  sorry that's  not possible  why aren't  you competing  because I  wasn't asked 
[01:17:30]  Bobo called  you out  you're being  asked  good for  fucking  Bobo  Bobo called  you out  and said  he could do  more sit-ups  than you  Bobo  I mean  he gave  us numbers  Bobo said  he could do  470 sit-ups  in a half  hour  470  in a half  hour  what's the  record  I don't even  think  are they  retard sit-ups  or real sit-ups  he said he could  do sit-ups  come on  Bobo said  he could do  150 push-ups  in a half  hour  then take a  break for  Gatorade  and then do  470 sit-ups  in another  half hour 
[01:18:00]  Bobo was  incredibly  confident  yes  he said  he's gonna  kick the  shit out  of Eric  is what  he said  kick  the  shit  out of Eric  not just  win  no no  kick  the  shit  he's gonna  embarrass and  humble  E-Rock  is what  he said  I will  humble you  exactly  how many  sit-ups  470  in a half  hour  yes  I will  give him  a dollar  for every  sit-up he does  over 200  over 200  how about  how about  a dollar  for every 
[01:18:30]  sit-up  he does  over  over 3  no but  I'm saying  if he does  470  that's a nice  day  I'll give him  270 bucks  Bobo is not  gonna do  470  I can't do  that  you're safe  by saying  I'll give him  a dollar  for every  push-up  he does  over 20  give him  a thousand  dollars  for every  push-up  I'll give him  a dollar  for every  push-up  he does  could you  just see him  there  he'll be  like  looking around  for approval  like  not being able  to get his  head off  the floor  how many  push-ups  he said  he could  do  150 
[01:19:00]  in a half  hour  in a half  hour  now let's  wait  let's go  back to  sit-ups  how many  sit-ups  470  in a half  hour  yes  okay  well  this is  not  impossible  because  Jack LaLanne  did  a thousand  in 23  minutes  so  Jack LaLanne  did he do  a thousand  sit-ups  yes  yeah  he's  dead  god damn  Jack LaLanne  in 23  minutes  that motherfucker  was in  shape  it doesn't  say  but he was  averaging  44.9  23 minutes  he did  that  the record  in an  hour  yeah  is 
[01:19:30]  2200  2200  which was  set  just  last month  I gotta  tell you  60 year old  Vladimir  J-U-R-C-I-K  Vladimir  I do this  sit-up  and  win  I can't  do them  everything  the ONA  physical fitness  challenge  is gonna  be a bust  unless  Iraq  joins  this  Iraq  what the  fuck  you're in  Eric's gonna  kick Bobo's  ass  why  no because  I wasn't  asked  this whole  thing was  set up  on the  subject  like oh  don't even 
[01:20:00]  bother  he's just  going to  do it  I'm  I came  back and  they're like  oh guess  what you're  doing  Friday  no I'm  not  wait  Iraq  we didn't  ask you  because we  did not  want to  bother you  on your  honeymoon  bullshit  bullshit  you can  call me  with whale  noises  but you  can't  say hey  you want  to do  sit-ups  on Friday  fuck  both of  you  we didn't  want to  bother you  with show  stuff  when you're  on your  honeymoon  it would  have been a  complete  lack of respect  you'd call me  with whale  noises  whale 
[01:20:30]  noises  could be the  funniest thing  Iraq's ever  said on this  show  did you eat  unhealthily on  your honeymoon  or no  I actually  I actually  very well  except for the  ice cream  yeah bullshit  twit picked ice  cream  yeah exactly  why would you  do that to  yourself  why would you  twit pick ice  cream  that's what I  tell Iraq  off the air  when we have  one on ones  I'm like you do  it to yourself  then you say  why don't you  play along with  the bits  so that's what  I'm doing  so when Jimmy  look Jimmy had  a really  what's this world 
[01:21:00]  coming to  Jimmy had a  and I gotta say  he had a really  funny line while  doing the Jamaican  accent saying  the bowls were  falling out the  door like marbles  falling out of a  closet that was  pretty funny and  then he kept  going him like  the ice cream  so that's what I  did and I put  him I had them  put him in  martini glasses  just like the  martini steak  and put it up on  Twitter to say I  was going with  it  fantastic  but you actually  were eating ice  cream out of a  punch bowl  when we ran out 
[01:21:30]  of martini glasses  him was eating  out of the  champagne tub  there it is  there it is  and I don't  why does he have  a Twitter name  that's 70  characters you  idiot  who is that  what an idiot  because Bobo  had to change  his Twitter name  now because we  changed channels  radio Bobo  XM 105  but somebody took  radio Bobo 105  before he could  get it  and they started  tweeting all of us  saying just so  you know this is  Bobo and this is 
[01:22:00]  my new Twitter name  but there's his  tweet I will beat  E-Rock in a  sit-up contest  yeah which is  this poor guy  E-Rock is not  Eric  that's not  E-Rock's Twitter  I know  Eric's E-Rock  radio  this guy in  Kansas City  is like  who the fuck  is the fuck  is E-Rock  guy's a big  Royals fan  just wants to  go watch  fucking  listen to  Wilbur Harrison  songs and go  to Royals  games  boo twice  did you say  Minnesota and  Royals in the  same  no I said  Wilbur Harrison  song  Kansas City 
[01:22:30]  here I come  they got a lot  of pretty girls  and I'm gonna  get me one  it's a good song  let's hear it  good ditty  why am I the  only one picking  songs  I agree but he's  looking up Kansas  City under C  I want to hear this  I don't really  understand this  physical challenge  thing without  E-Rock it's not  E-Rock's in  yeah we need  E-Rock  Wilbur Harrison  we have it  E-Rock if we  ask nicely will  you do the  thing Friday  I got the  song  no no wait  will you do 
[01:23:00]  the contest  if we ask  nicely  no because  this whole  thing was  sold  son of a  bitch  and done  before even  asking me  or they just  said oh guess  what you're doing  it's already  done deal  no  so how do  we change  that  seven dollars  some kind of  action figure  oh yeah  we'll take you  to Comic Con  and buy you  whatever you  want  maybe we  give you  some pocket  money  to buy an  action figure  how about if  you beat  Bobo 
[01:23:30]  Bobo's  banned from  the show  or if  you know  you can beat  Bobo  and you get  an Undertaker  toy  how about if  we beat  if you  beat Bobo  we have to  be nice to  you  and if  we're not  nice to  you  I don't  know  I'm not  how do  we do  that  how do  we do  that  how that's  done  but then  maybe there's  a little  penalty if  we're not  nice to  you  oh shit  we can  work out  some shit  here  like a curse  jar where you  put money in 
[01:24:00]  if you curse  pocket money  you gotta put  pocket money  in every time  you make  fun of your  pocket money  because what  happens is he  goes to all  these conventions  and he goes  out finding all  the different  treats that  everybody has  and before  he knows  it all  his pocket  money is  gone  his pocket  money  that he's  saving for  action figures  every time  he saves  his money  up  what ends  up happening  A-Rock  that you  don't have  enough pocket  money for  your action  figure  it was never  that case  that he ran  out of money  because you  found the  transformer that  had the cassette  tape deck in it 
[01:24:30]  yeah but it was  also $180  and you didn't  have enough  pocket money  that's a lot  of pocket money  you had spent  all your pocket  money irresponsibly  no I spent  it getting  shit signed  by you know  celebrities  he buys other  treats  yeah he's  very short sighted  when it comes  to his pocket  money  and so when  he sees something  later in the day  that he'd like  he's already  spent it all  he does love  treats doesn't  he loves treats  he's a very  indulgent young  man  is there food  at those  things  you don't eat  the food  at those  things  the food's  not good  what do you 
[01:25:00]  starve  no  you just  don't eat  there  are you going  to comic-con  in San Diego  no  are you  hopefully  hopefully  Iraq will be  part of the  physical fitness  challenge  on Friday  he's going to  beat Bobo  anything else  we have to  say about  what do we  have to get  out there  well we need  people that  want to win  tickets to  this awesome  Pocono 500  race  and look  the more  people that  enter  the more  likely it  is that  we're going  to get  Iraq to  compete  so if  you want  to see  Iraq and

[01:34:30]  with you  in another car  and then you  in your own car  and I guess  as you go around  they kind of increase  the speed on you  and before you know it  you're whipping around  that fucking track  yeah you follow the instructor  your turn one  makes you feel  a little weird  because that's one of the  ones that are more banked  and it feels like  it wants to suck you down  into the infield  so you really got to  kind of  it looks very cool  just stay on the  fucking rubber 
[01:35:00]  look at where  everyone else went  and stay on that  you know how impossible  that would be for me to do  to stay on the rubber  and you too  from what I understand  well I know  that's the first time  I love it to say that  I hope you get the Shelby  out there  and fucking  something happens at 60  where the engine blows  and you're humiliated  no the Shelby  I'll have to feel out  you know  go around a little slow  at first  and kind of  gradually get it up to speed 
[01:35:30]  but the straightaway  is very long  very nice  and I think I'll be able  to get the Shelby  really cranked  how long are you on  the straightaway for  well it would depend  on how fast you're going  how long is it  how long is that  a mile  I don't know  it's a two and a half mile  two and a half mile track  so  you racing for pinks  let's race for pinks  for pink socks  I get to fuck you  in the ass  and pull out  my dry dick  real fast and hard  right over the  right over the fucking 
[01:36:00]  hood of your nice car  so you have fecal matter  and fucking  flecks of ass skin  on your car  and then when you  drive fast  the wind blows  them onto your windshield  you're racing for pink socks  yeah  raking for pink socks  yeah  Kenicky  gets to put his penis  in your buttocks  and remove them  quickly  John Travolta nails him  after he hit his head  on the door  doesn't know what  happened  yeah  Travolta's kissing him  like that man  on the stairs  with the airplane  Kenicky  fucked Travolta's wig off  it fell into the engine  caused an engine fire

[01:39:30]  we could do this in a break  matter of fact  Oompa Loompas  Scorch was talking  to the Oompa Loompas  Oompa Loompas  and we called in  to Scorch's show  to shoot the shit with him  yeah to shoot the shit  and then Ramon  got on the phone  yeah  I wasn't sure  if he had really  been simulcasting  now Sam Roberts  was there at the time  with Scorch  he was lying about it  because we were cursing  and he's like  it's okay  I don't give a fuck  he was not simulcasting  he was not simulcasting  he was playing songs  in commercials  right  oh  that's when you were  working for him 
[01:40:00]  before you backstabbed him  yeah yeah  okay  I'm just trying to  alright  gotcha  your backstab is coming soon  I know  I'm not stupid  okay  and I appreciate  the backwards compliments  E-Rot gave me  on the 10 o'clock hour  oh my god  it wasn't even  pound you  it wasn't even  that was a compliment  I don't think so  he said it would  pin him  what was it  what did he say  there was some nasty  stuff said about you  yesterday on that  fucking post game  this is the  go ahead  I love pre-San  Robert's life  word for word  how do you describe me  here comes the pre- 
[01:40:30]  here comes the pre-  here's Z-Rock everyone  oh great  I don't remember  I  no I did  I just don't know  what I said  I was sitting there  and I was saying  um  did I make fun of people  oh okay  yeah yeah  yeah  so Sam tried  taking a page  from Opie's book  it wasn't what I was  trying to do  you're the one  who brought up Opie  the same speech  he's given to me  and to you  he's never given  that speech to me  because he doesn't  treat me like he treats you  this is exactly  what was happening  yesterday  and then 
[01:41:00]  but  but  but  but  but  E-Rock really  kind of put you  in a bad light  because I wasn't  going for that  I just said  I make fun of people  I care about  and then E-Rock goes  yeah like somebody else  who sits in that seat  yeah  yeah  that was it  where did that come from  because he was saying  word for word  the exact same thing  that Opie said  to me  and said to him  I've never heard it  and what is it  what was the word for word  what is it  it was that  look  I make fun of you  because I like you  and I cut him off  and I go  that's the same thing  that Opie says to us 
[01:41:30]  he's panicking  you're saying to me  can you get the clip  from your show Sam  you bet I could  the shit show  he is a panicky  because he can't do it  in front of me  the pussy  but he said it  when I was  fuck it was in Kenny's car  and he said it was venom  and now he has a chance  to say it to my face  and once again  he backs down  now say it  say it  stick up for yourself  come on puss boy  say it  hang on  puss boy  come on puss boy  he's gonna find the clip  it was right  like  it was close  to the beginning  no it was right  before the scorch bit  I guess  must have been  I would be proud of him  if he said it to my face 
[01:42:00]  I wouldn't even be mad  that what frustrates me  about this kid  he doesn't fight his battles  no he doesn't  the Nagelmeister  can't find it  I'll tell you  Sam  Sam takes shit  very well  I'm breaking character  right now  believe it or not  Troy Kwan  takes shit very well  he takes it a lot  he knows how to  fucking battle back  yeah  E-Rock  doesn't take shit well  you don't have questions  you know it's questions  I've got questions  Troy Passive-Aggressive  hey look  if you want to believe  what the government tells you  because you know 
[01:42:30]  you're a piece of garbage  it's fine  so what do you believe  I don't know  I just have questions  and then  and then you come back  at him with the facts  well what do you believe  do you believe it  you go  well I'm smart with that  answer your question  with a question  he's got quite the spin  do they  do they  do they  do they do that  why  because that  told you  and he points for the TV  because that told you  yeah that told you  well then what do you believe  I don't know  I just have questions  alright  non-committal shit 
[01:43:00]  he says  I find him entertaining  I find him entertaining  I disagree with Troy  but I respect the fact  that he tries fighting back  that's all I'm saying  yeah  I'm like E-Rock  you're saying  yes  exactly  I wouldn't even be mad  if he said it to my face  what he said on the show yesterday  oh you got it  Travis  oh there it is  Travis couldn't wait  Travis big smile on his face  comes in with a disc  and this will prove my point  E-Rock could not say this to my face  live  right  but yesterday when I was long gone 
[01:43:30]  look how confident  he is  I was driving home  listening to what I call  the shit hour  and this is  fair  yeah see  no  and this is what  oh shit  I told you  no  what happened  I gave you something different  oh that's something else  what is this  what's that  just play it  that  this  this is  this is for Troy  oh oh for Troy  oh oh for Troy  Troy's new thing  Troy's new thing  you'll enjoy it  it's not what you were prepping  well you're gonna give up  the other thing  we should get the other thing  get the other thing  you know 
[01:44:00]  you know  you know  you know  I don't trust anybody  there has been an attempt  on the life of President Kennedy  I want to see the body  you know  there is an agenda  with our government  we've been lied to before  do you know for sure  it's a little hard to believe  you know  I don't trust anybody  you know  you know  you know  you know  is it the truth  I don't know  that's fucking great  classic Troy  oh  oh is that 
[01:44:30]  classic Troy  fucking bravo  I want to know  who molested  that poor sweet boy  oh I know right  and wiped his fucking  trust blackboard clean  Jimmy's flow chart  goes to molest  every time  oh yeah  that's just amazing  if you have some weird quirk  that means you were touched  only always  only because he's so  only always  no only because he's so  he's so  untrusting  yes he's very untrusting  even those Venn diagrams  where it's two circles  and then there's like 
[01:45:00]  when they  when they intersect  where they intersect  yeah  Jimmy  there was a graph of Jimmy  there's a huge area  in the middle  that says molested  yeah yeah  barely any sticking out  from the other sides  it's virtually once  the shit squad  is working on  finding that clip  from the shit hour  from the shit hour  right  oh now you got a shit squad  yeah  that's my staff  that's wonderful Sam  shitmo squad  shitmo squad  yeah  I'll tell you right now  you backstab me  I'll fucking shoot you  what  that's where I'm at

[01:46:00]  Sam Roberts  talking with various  members of the staff  here's what I heard  in Kenny's car  yesterday  Iraq knew  I was long gone  I gave him  I gave him the opportunity  to do it live  in front of my fucking face  today  once again  he disappointed me  of course  because he can't fight this shit  puss is out  that's right  and when he  Iraq you know  I wouldn't be mad  if he  if he fucking  said it to my face  believe it or not  because that's what I want  from this fucking kid  fight back  fight the fuck back  fight back  I forgot 
[01:46:30]  wear your balls  but here it is  from yesterday  when I was long gone  Iraq you know  first hand  and Roland you do too  that the ones I care about  are probably the ones  I treat the worst  yes  I mean the ones  that I have the most  hurtful things to say  Eric  and those are the ones  I care  I like Eric  I like Roland  I say horrible  hurtful things about them  sounds like a speech  from somebody else  but go ahead  what a speech from who  Opie  where you're standing  you think Opie says that  I think you're  reciting word for word  the same shit  that he says 
[01:47:00]  yeah you know  I like you  but you know  fuck you  that's not how  he's getting at  is it  Opie Jr  he said that to you  he said that to me  he's never said that to me  he treats me very well  oh yeah right  he does  for instance  when he named the show  The Shit Hour  he treats me great  see there you go  wow  you couldn't do it live  he fucking  see now  the way you described it  let me tell you something  the way you described it  today live  during this show  was nothing 
[01:47:30]  compared to how  fucking like  venomous  venomous  yes  there was real  venom  real anger  where'd the fuck you  come from  yeah yeah yeah  yep yep  the way he talks  like not even saying  his name  the way he talks  he didn't even want  to say Opie  because he was  disgusted  the guy who stands  there  fucking Opie  yeah that fucking dick  yeah yeah we heard it  let's get  let's get  whatever I'm fine with that  it's too bad  you can't do it live  though  chicken shit  listen to me  chicken shit 
[01:48:00]  E-Rock  when you're on  when you're on  your honeymoon  and unfortunately  you got  you know  interrupted  unfortunately  it happened  for 40 minutes  some saying  some saying  bit of the year  we'll have to wait  and see if that  becomes bit of the year  fucking  but  I want to  I want you to rank  who you're  mad at  the most  me  Jimmy  or Anne  from top  from bottom to top  what a loaded question 
[01:48:30]  bottom to top  so the least angry  first  least angry  first  least angry  as far as that  whole bit goes  and why  hold on  and the why  I already know  the list  and the why  don't say it  let's write it down  I guarantee  Jimmy  fucking skates  on this one  let's write it down  even though he came up  with the Jamaican character  Opie you make a list too  everybody make your list  everybody make a list  least to most hated  yes  alright  least to most  no well  least to most  least  one two three

[01:49:30]  like what do you  they are  he is a  from the  especially from the back  he looks like the fucking  warden from  Midnight Express  and from the front  yeah it does  from the front  yeah  beat somebody's feet  with a stick  while his big fat  kids look on  I know  I just want to put a flower  in someone's hiney  okay sir  we're ready  I have  we're ready  third place  third place  the ones  that doesn't  that you don't hate  as much  based on 
[01:50:00]  overall  or based on recently  based on the bit  based on the interruption  of your honeymoon  who do you blame the most  and is mad at the most  I thought it was just  overall  overall  yeah  I want to do the bit  part  but was Jimmy even here  of course it was  he's the Jamaican character  oh right okay  I thought you were absent  then we can do part two  that's fine  great  the bit though  because that's gotten  a lot of fucking legs  yeah  go ahead  least pissed off 
[01:50:30]  number three  would be Jimmy  of course  okay  Jimmy just fucking  he's taking a victory lap  that's right  why  the champ  he beat the shit out of you  but his characters  because he did it in character  no  because Jimmy treats  everybody  like that  it was no different  than what he would do  if I was standing in there  and  oh so you're saying  he makes fun of everybody  equally  he doesn't just pick on you  he'd do that to anybody  there's no racial bigotry here  when you don't look down  on niggers 
[01:51:00]  kikes  whops  or greasers  here you are all  equally worthless  that's fucking great  oh man  now I want to see  who number two is  yeah number two  I already know it  which we will know then  what number one is  oh yeah  so should we  should we announce  the winner  or the runner up  so you might as well go  announce the winner  so announce the runner up  and then the winner celebrates  do pageant fucking  yeah  pageant rules  okay  oh wait a minute  wait a minute  I made a mistake  hold on hold on  hold on  motherfuckers 
[01:51:30]  I fucked up  by the way  my list is intact still  is yours  uh  my list  intact  was your list intact  you had no doubt  that he wasn't mad at you  I changed  I wrote it down wrong  but my list is exactly  what it was  are you still in this game  oh I knew it was  did he pick you  as the third  I did  yes I rewrote  here's what I wrote  Sam can see  yeah  I wrote me  and then I wrote  that but I actually  just wrote that down  all right go ahead  erock  this is we're going  with runner up 
[01:52:00]  now  runner up  pageant rules  runner up  is going to be  opi  oh  there it is  which makes me  the most annoying  and there it is kids  and I had it too  I had it  I was convinced  it was me  nope  I had it too  I had it  I lose  I had it too  yes  that's a shock  I knew it  why  why  why  why  why didn't I get the top spot 
[01:52:30]  and then you have to go with it  all right  well that's the same answer  why you didn't get the top spot  and why Ant is number one  is because Ant gave out where I was  no you weren't staying at Fatlantis  and it was the way he gave it out  not only did he give out your location  it was the way he gave it out  oh that's terrible  the way he gave it out  yes hurtful  but he gave it out  so when he  the last call you guys did  and I heard whale sounds 
[01:53:00]  where I put the phone over the balcony  and just walked out of the room  you didn't know that  no  that's even better  I came back later that day  with a message to contact  the front desk of the hotel  oh boy  people were calling  for about an hour  after you guys were  done with  talking to me  trying to find  what room I was in  trying to get connected to me  they thought there was an emergency  that so many people  were trying to call  there was  we wanted you on the program  it was also the way  you gave out Fatlantis 
[01:53:30]  was Opie saw somebody  on the phone line  that could guess where it was  and Opie goes  yeah  he was like  no we can't go to that one  and then you said  why isn't it obvious  Fatlantis  oh no  hence  shitster  oh no  it was all on the record  you got some t-shirts  in the future  it was all on the record  it might have slipped out  it was an accident  yeah that was an accident  but overall though  how about  not just with the bit  round two  overall  here's round two 
[01:54:00]  let me get the sheet again  and um  make your overall list everybody  yes  yes  okay  alright  here is overall  on the actual  just  yes  the show  um  uh  who  even in life  who don't like  in life  in life  I mean  do you need time to think  we can always have a moment of music  do you need some music he rock  him and Troy are arguing  there's a good boy phone 
[01:54:30]  and a naughty boy phone  a naughty boy's phone  and his good boy's phone  I sing that sometimes  for no reason  everybody does  I just walk around the house  singing that god damn song  a naughty boy  well because  he has a good  you have to dip when you sing it  not to dip  he has a good  you have to go like this  should I get this on film too  no I won't do it on film yet  it's not ready  yes  eventually I will  but I'm not ready yet  alright alright  no problem  he has a good boy phone 
[01:55:00]  and his naughty boy's phone  and you have to like  robot the  yeah you gotta kind of  you do a little dance  and your head  kind of tilts sideways  it goes down a little bit  bend up a little bit  and down a little bit  I see what you're doing there  he has a good boy's phone  and his naughty boy's phone  and you have to do robot movements  yeah  with the phones in each hand  yes you do  one in each  looking at each phone  as you pick out  the good boy phone  and the naughty boy phone  and the beauty is  that people really do  start singing that  yes  and that's the only reason  I brought it to the show 
[01:55:30]  it's so annoying  was to get it in  everybody's awful head  oh god  you're good at that  I know  it's so terrible  isn't it  I thought I was an asshole  Jesus  oh he's the best  my manager is so OCD  I knew it would get to him  and he's like  my wife just asked me  when I was singing  around the house  alright sorry  I didn't mean to interrupt  go ahead  number three  number three  the least hated person 
[01:56:00]  Jim Norton  yay  yay  of pudding  why is that  of course  check mark there  I got that  again  same answer  Jim does what he does  and it's never any different  oh sorry  that's it  it's like  right  Jim is  is what he is  I'm also seen  as less of an authority  figure by Eric  oh  I'm  because even though  what happened to me  being one of your  fucking heroes  asshole  that went out the window  you let him down  Hulkamania  but that's 
[01:56:30]  I was fucking top five  but he expects more  to you  I'm like  I want to know  you know what  I also want to know  it's not disrespectful to you  who was on his top five again  hero list  Hulk Hogan  oh god  your dad  my dad  that's the only three I remember  and I laughed  and he got so pumped  oh god  I think he started tearing up  a little bit  so who replaced me  in the top three  Jesus  who's now in the top three  your dad  Scott  Gary  Steve Blatter  Danny  Sam

[01:57:30]  Little Caesar  Duncan Hines  Colonel Sanders  Sarah Lee  and Dominic Inno  known as Dom  no you know  here's what it is  Eric expects more  to open amp  because you guys  are like parents  or authority figures  I'm telling you  I'm not seen as  well that's true  in life  but I mean  I'm not seen as  an authority figure  he's also saying  that you make fun  of everybody equally  which he hasn't said  but implies  that the others  make fun of him  more than they do  anywhere else  that is a good  implication  number two overall 
[01:58:00]  who fucked him  number two  here it is  number two  Anthony  oh shit  which makes  Opie  number three  there it is  I was wrong  right there  I was wrong  I had the whole thing  picked out perfectly  what the fuck  I knew it  I was wrong  I could read  Iraq like a book  it's perfect  I went from  I went from  being a hero  to a zero  to a goat  what a fall from grace  yeah that really is  that really was  a fall from grace

[02:00:30]  probably one retweeted  by people  or in studio  when we brought it up  right  right  let me see  E-Rock radio  there it is  E-Rock radio  I spent all this time  he didn't even know  though  he didn't even realize  he didn't see his tweets  he doesn't think about you  I don't exist  so if he doesn't exist  he should be on the top  of your list  there you are  following  I'm fucking not  following you  oh shit  oh your count  stays the same  you pick one up  and you lost one  you pick up an ally 
[02:01:00]  you lose an ally  I didn't say he hates  Obi  what the fuck  wow  I would like to know  why he hates  Obi so much  how can I not be  following E-Rock  because he had  some good tweets  like this one  at Trucking James  nope  was accurate  ha ha  is the cake boss  on your hero list  ugh  no  fucking rip off  whoa  I agree  oh let's see  my fucking sister  could take  that motherfucker down 
[02:01:30]  and maybe that's why  you rock hates you  and your mom  no she couldn't take down  my mom  what  she couldn't take down  my mom  with that dry ass  cake your mom sent in  I meant your mom  could take down  the cake boss too  oh okay  but not  not Martha Stewart though  Iraq doesn't tweet much  she can't take down  nobody  you don't tweet much  I try not to  like I do once in a while  but you guys always  complain about people  that tweet a million times  well if it's you know  pertinent  yeah  I have nothing pertinent  no  I hope I didn't talk  all of that  that was a good one 
[02:02:00]  I have nothing pertinent  I'm not good  I'm not good  it's one of the best  fucking audio grabs ever  there you go  Iraq now you're in my life  as a  as a tweety guy  please just do nothing  but over tweet  and annoy him  the next couple days  I'll just block him  yeah prepare to be blocked  no  no no  I  now  I'm following the Iraq  okay so  I'm kind of irrelevant to you  Anthony hurt your feelings 
[02:02:30]  because you felt like  you weren't a part of  his life  or his psyche  but didn't hurt enough  to make him number one  right but  all of a sudden  real motherfucker  all of a sudden  there's a log in shoes  what happened  so what you're implying is  that Obi on the other hand  does pay attention to you  and it's so bad  negative  that you  that's so negative  yeah  could you ring that bell there  please  oh shit  and the other thing too  give yourself a bill  that Obi picks on Iraq  way worse  than everybody else 
[02:03:00]  he'll look past  he'll look past  other people's shortcomings  and then just attack Eric  it's what Eric's saying  this is weird  because I'm not the same  negative person I used to be  I didn't think so either  but you've taken all that  negativity  and just put it to one guy  one focal point  like a magnifying glass  oh wow  go ahead E  well  no he  he pretty much  nailed it  where  you leave  and say  I meet you  for dinner  or something  everything  that I do  around Opie 
[02:03:30]  is detailed  and documented  if not videotaped  when I wasn't paying attention  and then gets brought up  to the show  so you're saying  that when Opie  I'm socially awkward  I don't know how  to have friends  it's okay  yeah  why are you socially awkward  huh  you're a nice guy  but why are you mean to Eric  if he loves you so much  you were his hero  and you took that opportunity  to be mean to him  I'm mean to Eric  because I want him  to be tougher  I want him to have  tough skin  but it's not working  just a lot of it  not at all 
[02:04:00]  he needs positive  he needs scaffolding  at this point  positive reinforcement  you better be positive  the floor is reinforced  yes we understand  oh Eric's got a sad face  and he's eating his breakfast  oh my sweetie  what's in that wrap  is it a healthy wrap  no  it's toast  oh okay  oh your hands shaking  I get frustrated  that Eric doesn't have  tougher skin  and doesn't fight back 
[02:04:30]  oh  yeah  so you're just mean to him  to try to make him stronger  yeah  like naming your son Sue  would be a thing  like a boy named Sue  yeah yeah  like that  I just did it  the song says  I just did that  because I knew  I wouldn't be around  all the time  and I wanted you  to be a stronger guy  so you wanted him  to thank you  for the gravel in his guts  and the spit in his eye  yeah  that's right  as Johnny Cash said  Eric do you buy that 
[02:05:00]  I was a lot thinner  when I started this show  oh you're blaming me  for your weekend  get the fuck out of here  get the fuck out of here  is your radio show  making you fat  we'll tell you at 11  get the fuck out of here  he won't put tell you  on the 10 o'clock news  oh chip  wow he's kind of blaming you  you're blaming me  for your fucking waking  no  do you think you'd have been  a svelte man  if you had a different job  I think so 
[02:05:30]  do you think the stress  of this job  kind of makes you  seek comfort in the food  I just think the environment  of this show  but you also  you didn't answer  whether or not you think  I'm not saying that it's not my fault  that I gained this weight  do you think Opie's being truthful  two  wait two  oh  you're saying it's not your fault  that you gained that weight two  so you are shifting  you are sharing responsibility  I'm not saying you force  like you force fed me  while I was working here  who complimented you  on the honeymoon bit  saying how great it was  alright do we have to get back 
[02:06:00]  into the  I fuck with the people  that I like  I compliment you though  we had a nice talk  he doesn't believe  what you're saying  I compliment you  saying how great the bit was  and how everyone  thought it was  a great bit  and could be bit of the year  do you believe Opie's  trying to toughen up your skin  when I'm talking to him  I go  what the fuck  are you calling me  on my honeymoon  and you go  that was bit of the year  do you know how many people  love that  deal with us  fucking up your honeymoon  yeah exactly  so there's a lot 
[02:06:30]  of resentment there  a little resentment  I think a lot  yeah a lot  there's some  what do you resent the most  I don't know right now  I'd have to think  just think  think  that's why we're  what was that  I was rolling  doing whale noises  rolling  can't get enough  of that bit  oh god  where's rolling  he's in  is rolling like  when Eric's weight  is made fun of  yes because then  it takes attention  off of his weight  oh 
[02:07:00]  rolling get close  to a mic  and I don't mean  to make you perform  but just do a little  bit of the Jamaican  character  so he could hear it  hello  a little bit of the  Jamaican character  no no I mean Jimmy  oh  just a little  um  Iraq blaming  Opie because  it was so  fought  ain't fair  that's like  that's like  blaming a crowd  because it rains  he laughs like 
[02:07:30]  oh yeah  yeah  he laughs like  a whale  all right  oh god  can we take a  break now  I want Iraq to  mention some of  his representatives  he's not doing it  yeah he's not  mentioning why  he resents you  he's doing the  thing that you  always say that  he does where  he's not  addressing the  issue  you're saying  basically he's  shirking his  duties  exactly  are you mad  that I'm  I'm closer  with Sam  than you  no  and that whole  dynamic changed  over the years 
[02:08:00]  it did  yeah  you were like  the top dog  had muckety muck  I was just an  intern  and you were  just an intern  and then this  kind of dynamic  change where  Opie started  maybe  I blame Sam  in the end  for what  being likable  you're not likable  I think I am  you have the  you have the  fucking worst  traits of both  races  oh  Iraq should have  whacked you out  like when he  saw that  power change  happening  yeah  yeah  I blame  Sam for  being the  type of  person  that I  would hang 
[02:08:30]  out with  more  oh  that seems  like you're  shifting  responsibilities  now Opie  we've been  interrogating  Iraq for a while  but I would  like to ask  you something  what is it  about Sam  that's different  from Iraq  that you  find yourself  maybe having  a little more  in common  with or  hanging out  with him  more  or just  genuinely  like him  more  why do you  just generally  like him  more  as a person  and value  his opinion  more  I love  people that  are assholes  I'm not an 
[02:09:00]  asshole  because he  stirs the shit  up  yeah we  sort of have  some things  in common  but there's  got to be  a little more  than just  that  I would think  like if you're  hanging out  you're able  to talk  about things  and the  video thing  is kind of  you know  Sam's into  that whole  aspect of  what you're  doing  and shit  like that  and Iraq  of course  completely  dropped the  ball  and never  got involved  in it  he wasn't  asked to  really  yeah that's  true  he's probably 
[02:09:30]  got no real  talent at that  we can all  be the judge  because after  Opie started  doing video  yeah  I mean don't  pretend like  Iraq video  doesn't exist  because I mean  Iraq you did  try to get  into the video  game after  Opie started  oh wait a minute  I tried to  learn the  editing software  and all that  stuff and  he tried to  because he  said oh  pop is doing  it I can  do it too  oh no  did he change  it no  do you have  Eric's eye  why aren't you  taping anything  around here too  except there's  coming it  Eric's blowhole 
[02:10:00]  should have went  with whipped cream  try Iraq radio  poor Iraq  we're gonna  we're gonna  work on our  relationship  I want to  see his videos  is that what's  gonna happen  you have  do holiday  greeting  holiday greeting  is good  holiday greeting  is it just you  no  holiday greeting  that's the  Yule log  playing  thank you coke 
[02:10:30]  logic  what is that  at the end  it goes  Iraq video  and it's  him as  Super Mario  it's awesome  try Rick Springfield  Jesse's girl  Rick Springfield  Jesse's girl  I don't think  I've seen this one  Roland Sims  Jesse's girl  I asked you  four times  to watch it  is the sound up  I saw this one  I didn't like this one  does the sound up  no  I don't want it  I want to hear  I want to hear Roland  the problem is  like  who fucking 
[02:11:00]  filmed shadows  it's Roland  singing  hey by the way  you're not shooting  Citizen Kane  these fucking  shadows  Orson  I know  that's what I'm saying  he's shooting Orson  though  Iraq if you moved  I'll give you a little tip 
[02:11:30]  if you moved the video  to your right  it would have taken  the light away  from the background  and then Roland  would have fucking appeared  and filmed something good  that was an easy fix  and when you're driving  and he doesn't know  that I'm taping him  off my fucking camera phone  so I just turned it on  just to try to grab him  so he thinks  you're just holding  your phone at him  for what purpose?  he wasn't paying attention  so I just put it down  and all that  right  what about the outro?  where were you guys  going together?  yeah where were you?  we know where you  weren't going together 
[02:12:00]  we're going up to Foxwoods  but I'm the asshole  I'm just teasing  yeah you mean it  yeah  Iraq doesn't  my opinion of Eric  is not as important to him  as your opinion of him  yeah that's true  that's why me teasing him  is not as bad  because he values  what you say about him  a lot more  I think mine too  mine doesn't matter  to him as much  because I just  kind of don't think  about him  after the show's over  yeah  in fact you're dressed  like a Cuban rebel  every day  makes him question  your judgment  like a Sandinista  yeah  you really are 
[02:12:30]  silly goose  arms for beers  silly goose nailed it  thank you  nailed it  Mineola  Opie uses Sam  for Sam's mother  so Opie could feel  genuine motherly love  that's true  wow  I mean you do  how much does Bobby love me?  more than she should  okay  wow  have you ever met her  live and in person?  oh yes he has  oh yeah  Bobby rules  a couple times  I've even met her  haven't I?  where do I meet the bitch? 
[02:13:00]  do you want her to come in here  and meet you too Ian?  yeah  you want to come to my house?  you'd fall in love with Bobby  have her come to your house  if you have her come in  I will show up  I'll take a full Cialis  and show up in white spandex  oh shit  teacher who's boss  yeah  a full fucking Cialis rod  in my spandex  I think at one point  E-Rock thought of Opie  as like a role model  and a hero  I mean that's obvious  from the MySpace profile  and somebody that  you know  wait there's a MySpace 
[02:13:30]  oh that's where the hero list  came from  did he come up with  your hero list  that replaced me  and Hulk Hogan yet?  no  come on who?  I don't know  I gotta think of some people  well what else do you resent  about Opie  other than that he hangs out  with me instead of you  shit stir  yeah  but that's a good question though  you know  what is it about Gregorio  get to the heart of the issue  you're skirting the heart of the issue  hey  E-Rock  well let's make your Twitter  worth something today  oh see that's  do a before  do a before and after  picture 
[02:14:00]  what do you look like  before you joined  the Opie and Anthony  fucking  corporation  and what do you look like now  oh that's  that's kind of good  yeah  well someone's saying  just like the Elo thing  because this place  does ruin people  yeah it really does  oh yeah  yeah  I am  do you have a before picture  about the time you were hired  professor  Dr. Eric Nagel  is on  god that looks like  Elo a little bit too  yeah  yeah  Stephen Hawking  hair  but I want to know 
[02:14:30]  the root of Eric's resentment  he's not saying it  he never does  he's gotta learn  to speak up for himself  there's no resentment  you do resent  I don't like the fact  that you enunciated the T  in the middle there  no resentment  sorry it's there  what was I supposed to do  good point  that's that picture  of Eric with a retard  it looked like  it's a mirror  it looked like the Paris Hilton  thing had been photoshopped  I can't believe I've got a zero  in the mirror line  yeah  sorry 
[02:15:00]  I wasn't listening  really  nah fair enough  you're not mad  that I had a kid  and you're no longer  my kid right  none of that shit  okay  like the fucking  Snapple lady  on that fat show  I'm obsessed with that  I never got the attention  after my mother  had another child  you needy fat cunt  do you feel like  Opie's been too  genuinely mean to you  and not genuinely mean to Sam  like he'll  he'll make fun of Sam  and criticize  no I've seen him treat Sam  like shit too  oh damn  so is it other people 
[02:15:30]  Sam learns from it though  oh  hey uh  did I really say  what happened to me  being one of your  top five heroes  you fucking asshole  Liz what's that exactly  that doesn't say it all  that's it  did I really say it that way  the proverbial nutshell  because someone said  maybe this is why  alright  let's take a break  yeah  I can only handle so much  you rock  yeah the scores call  so uh  lumpas 
[02:16:00]  lumpa lumpas  how long ago was that  that was 2005  oh my god  and wasn't he uh  six years ago  wasn't he gonna be coming  to satellite radio  yes he announced  that he would be there  during that  in January 2006  but uh  nope  that slipped  nope  that slipped  yeah that's what he said  nope that slipped  as he said  he used to tell me  every two or three months  that he was going to  satellite radio  in two or three months  it's unbelievable  what bit was this  we were watching  he rocked marshmallow hat  marshmallow hat 
[02:16:30]  in a wonder woman costume  of course  costume  that's how you say it  ew  oh god damn  oh little sweetie  he probably is thinking  about all the things  like this that he's done  for the show  and then he still gets  treated unfairly  he looks like a  so fatale maid  he has creamy white stuff  on his heavy face  he has  marshmallow fluff  I believe that was  or something  hey  love that stuff  yes  it's great  eat your own hat day  go ahead  yeah I agree that 
[02:17:00]  um  not sam on twitter  has a passion for radio  like myself  I do have a passion  and you don't feel  iraq lost his passion  no he does not have a passion  he lost a bit  beaten out of him though  sometimes you can beat  sometimes you can beat  something into someone  or beat it out of him  you could break a horse  so you could ride him  but you don't want to  break his spirit  I believe his spirit  has been broken  but you guys made  every attempt  to break mine as well  uh did we though  absolutely  let me say  you know what  I'll defend myself 
[02:17:30]  I can name a whole list  of opies that were  in my life  that try to beat me  oh yeah yeah yeah  that try to beat me  out of this motherfucking  business  I had a lot of opies  in my fucking life  hmm  I can name them all  and you  are iraq's opie  I overcome  I overcame  I should say  he lost his passion  he lost it  he's not tough enough  he's not tough enough  he allowed his opie  D.O.R  he allowed his opie  to take him out of the game 
[02:18:00]  yeah  take that passion away  D.O.R  favorite food  you got taken out of the game  let's get the passion back  he's saying that basically  like the end of the Terminator  the weight of his criticism  crushed your skull  and the light flickered out  of your eyes  yes  fair analogy  you were looking through  hoping for love  and the crushing weight  of his rejection  yeah  and genuine criticism  don't blame me  motherfucker  that's on you 
[02:18:30]  I had enough fucking people  trying to knock my  fucking shit down  oh damn  I didn't blame you for that  I got tougher  I got tougher  ultimately we're all  responsible for ourselves  so you didn't blame him for that  no I didn't blame him for that  I'll play a card right now  I was a fucking wimp  when I started in this business  there was a lot of motherfuckers  knocking me around  knocking me the fuck around  I woke up one day  and said  I'm done  but what happened to E.R.O.K.  he's still getting  knocked the fuck around  unfortunately  but he's not  you really want to get into this 
[02:19:00]  but he's not that kid  anyway  he's reaching the point where  that's why it's frustrating  enough already  I was a wimp  in this business  coming up  a fucking wimp  you're saying  he's still a wimp  I was a wimp  even when  we first moved to AAF  so I was in the business  a long time  BAB  I was a wimp  well we took a lot of shit  from  AAF I turned  and never looked back  ooh  so there's like a mutual thing  going on here  okay  what are your goals E.R.O.K. 
[02:19:30]  shutting you the fuck up  and letting the business go  wow see  there you go  there you go  there you go  step number one  you know what  you just took your first baby step  the first step  the longest journey to the buffet  starts with one step  you just took your first baby elephant step  unfortunately that shut the fuck up  baby elephant  elephants are so big  they're so fat  that shut the fuck up  was not meant towards me  we all know where that anger  was meant to be  oh 
[02:20:00]  directing it towards  Opie  so you're saying that Sam  is an Opie mirror  where he'll bounce his anger  at you off of Sam  yes  I'm an easy target  I know  there's gotta be jealousy  such jealousy  oh jealousy  that knows no bounds  Opie's going over there  with the family  and you know  hanging out with my mom  yeah hanging out with your mom  and then Sam's going over the house  like what's up guys  hey buddy  and where are you  you're in Palookaville  and the girls probably like  chit chat a lot  and everything  he's like oh  say hello to Uncle Sam  to his kid 
[02:20:30]  oh Uncle Sam  that's funny  yeah exactly  don't tell him that  and Opie's like  and then Opie goes  this is another guy  I work with  Eric  yeah  and it's just like  ouch  yeah he looks like  a taller version of you  that body of Uncle Sam  goes over there  dressed in less mature clothing  Opie  I told you too  that  better eating habits  onesie  the nice gift you gave me  is at my brother's house  yeah  what's the rest of the nice gifts  I've ever given  that was another thing  we brought up on the shit show  right right  I heard that shit show  what was the nice gift 
[02:21:00]  he gave me a really nice picture  of let me think  Gillies  Nystrom  and  don't tell me  and  La Fontaine  no no no  Bill Tetley  Bill Tetley  mustache  help me out  mustache  back in hockey  in the fucking  early 80s  oh I know  oh my god  it's fucking  Randy Juergens  Randy fucking Juergens  that's right 
[02:21:30]  it was a 4 foot tall  custom framed  it was really nice  signed  Islanders picture  he gave Opie  this gift for Christmas  that gift  that's a great gift  I loved it  you know how long  it was in Opie's house  before it was given away  how long  you gave that away  18 hours  oh my god  because he said  what did you give it  to your brother  yes  because he's a huge fan  I have nowhere to  fucking hang it  you have a 4 bedroom mansion  shut up  I have nowhere to hang it  there's no wall space  oh 
[02:22:00]  could have hung in the restaurant  Gillies comes down there  he didn't even give it  to that brother  we already got a signed  Gillies picture in the restaurant  but he could have hung  in the restaurant  that's right  let the public see the gift  wow  given by the little plaque  presented by Iraq  the sex bagel  my brother has it  in his office  he loves it  I visit it from time to time  but that was meant for you  see the thought  that you just gave that away  that's very terrible  I'm tough to buy for  a lot of money  a lot of thought  a lot of thought  but that was an important gift  a lot of thought probably 
[02:22:30]  Iraq  I'm tough to buy for  could you honestly  just tell me a few  of the thoughts  and feelings  as you were purchasing that  finally I got a great gift  what you were thinking  he'll love it  this will make him love me again  well what made it different  from other things  was that this was  a joint gift  from my wife  and myself  it was from the Nagel family  so not only  did you feel like  he had jilted you  but he had jilted  the woman you love  she came across  and said  do you think he'll like this  I said  that's perfect 
[02:23:00]  let's get that  that's perfect  how long before  he gave it away  18 hours  18 hours later  yet he still has the  it would have been sooner  but I didn't have the family party  until 18 hours later  yet he claims  he still has that  shitty oil painting  he got for his wedding  that he's never revealed  to anybody  he kept that  wow  you're paying attention  damn  everyone else forgot about that  so you and your wife  pick out a nice gift  and you feel like  he gave it away  hold on  the oil painting  was done by a very close  member of my wife's family 
[02:23:30]  and that's not  hanging up either  E-Rock  it's not  I'll break character again  you didn't give it away though  you talked about how awful it was  and that you were going to reveal  on Twitter  a little piece of the  of the oil painting  as time went on  guess what  you just blew up my Twitter  OP Radio  because I'm showing that shit today  aw shit  you want to see the oil painting  that was given to me  as a wedding gift  I am tweeting that  motherfucker today  god damn  OP Radio  but E-Rock's heard that  they thought of the gift for you 
[02:24:00]  O-P-I-E-R-A-D-I-O  how much did it cost?  Travis just had a suggestion  if we could see  E-Rock's gift too  but you wouldn't be able to  are you going to your brother's house  does he have a Twitter?  his office  when was the last time  you saw that thing  Scott if you're listening  he listens every day  how big is the picture?  can you send me a picture  of E-Rock's gift  that is in your office?  that's a great gift  my motherfucking Twitter  is blowing up  how many signatures?  three  how much did it cost you?  come on how much?  a nice amount  how much?  the Nago family 
[02:24:30]  not just you  how much did the Nago family?  I'm not giving out the price  is it more than a hundred bucks?  yeah  custom framing alone  yeah  whatever  double matting  more than two  oh no  you had it matted in glass?  more than two  there was a custom made  Islanders logo  made  oh shit  licensed  licensed  look all I have to say  is live and learn  fuck  I lived and learned  no more gifts  you know how I see this  try harder  is what I'm saying  this is the theme  of this fucking segment  try harder  what do you get a millionaire? 
[02:25:00]  you know  you think something  that he liked hockey  by the way  to me this is  by the way  multi  this is a gift  from one family  to another  right  yes  Sam  so there you go  what have you gotten  Opie as a gift  and  great question  and Opie  where is that gift?  alright  for instance  yes  you know the latest version  of iMovie  iMovie 2011  oh yeah  yeah  what do you think  Opie bought that  for himself?  I was fucking  I was living with  the old one  oh my god  so now you got  the new one  from Sam Roberts  and what did you think? 
[02:25:30]  I loved it  my latest video  which is on  Opie Radio  it was edited  with iMovie  011  something you can use  is what I'm seeing  and he uses it  every day  hold on  yes  Sam  what else have you  given Opie?  have I given Opie?  yes  that he's  that he's  happiness  a smile  besides  hours  of bad radio  what else  you're just  feeding those  people on twitter  um  remember  when Opie 
[02:26:00]  had sweatpants  that he couldn't  keep up  and Steve Blatter  yelled at him  yeah  who do you think  bought him  the sweatpants?  oh shit  I knew he liked  sweatpants  I got him  a nice pair  so basically  he uses  your gift  every day  to cover  his genitals  exactly  and your other  gift  he uses  to create  right  on Opie Radio  on twitter  you want me  to tweet  my sweatpants  that Sam  gave me  Opie Radio  and  E-Rock's  gifts  get  given away  get given away  sometimes to goodwill  and put  pretty much  a hundred miles  away  it gets 
[02:26:30]  re-gifted  to his brother's  home office  in Long Island  wow  immediately  well hopefully  no one looks at it  I do want to see  that gift again  I hope my brother  sends a picture  today  and by the way  those sweatpants  it was very nice  I got them off season  they were on clearance  they didn't have to spend  a whole bunch of money  so they didn't even  have to spend  a lot of money  I bet E-Rock  spent $3.50  on that gift  that's knowing  that's knowing  your friend  at least  what'd you do  with the Justin Bieber  balloon  that gave your son  that thing  is still floating  on my ceiling  a Justin Bieber  balloon  outdoes  a custom Islander  do you want to see 
[02:27:00]  the Justin Bieber  balloon  Opie Radio  I got a lot of stuff  to tweet today  wow  that's insulting  he feels insulted  for his wife too  he feels like  they picked out  a gift together  and that it was  something that  they cared about  and even though  we joke on the show  like hey man  I know you're  going to like this  but he's tried  gifts like the  iMovie thing  hold on  I like the gift  no because you  gave it away  I just have nowhere  to hang it  I have a baby's room  now  you have a restaurant  where they go  all my radio shit 
[02:27:30]  went into a fucking  closet basically  I have nothing  hung up  in my place  but that's not radio shit  that's like a  sentimental gift  from E-Rock  like if someone  gave me something  a signed  like I've gotten  signed baseballs  and stuff like that  I put them right up  I have them displayed  because they're sentimental  you like that kind of stuff  what about when  Opie not so much  he likes that stuff  when Opie was like  talking about  not seeing Lost  and E-Rock goes  that was years ago  E-Rock goes  you know I'll bet  my friend  my close friend  and role model 
[02:28:00]  Opie  would love to see  this  I'm thinking  I'm gonna give him  the first couple seasons  the first couple  not just one box set  fuck where is that  you gave it away  to your brother  Elmo  Elmo's got that  so you gave him  a couple of Lost  seasons  it was right when  the show  just everybody  was really getting  into it  starting to talk  about it  and he's like  I haven't seen  the show  I haven't seen  the show  so you blocked  him for him  Elmo  got him the first  two seasons  if Elmo's listening  fucking take a  picture of that  Lost box set  so I can tweet 
[02:28:30]  that shit too  open radio  so I gotta find  all your gifts  to me  but E-Rock  doesn't make  like the money  that a lot of  people make  so that's hard  money  if he spends  $300 on a gift  or even a box  how much is a box set  $65 at least  and he bought  two of them  so that's $130  right there  and it's easy  to just buy  sweatpants  on clearance  yeah it was  off season  I bought them  in like May  they were winter  sweatpants  they were maybe  $15  we got somebody  asking a question  here  was  E-Rock  asked  if he could  do you a favor 
[02:29:00]  one day  and bring  your luggage  that you had  forgotten down  to Atlantic City  was E-Rock  asked about that  are you insulted  that you didn't  have to take  the trip  to AC  no I laughed  at you  on the phone  and hung up  and hung up  and then who  did deliver  that luggage  that was  Sam Roberts  the guy whose  gifts aren't  given away  he went  I think he  showed a little  appreciation  loyalty  and dedication  and I didn't  mind a nice  weekend  in Atlantic City  and hanging out  you got a  fucking room  out of the deal  and you laughed 
[02:29:30]  at me  I slept in  so enjoy  what's coming  your way  I got a free  room and he  had to buy  gifts that got  given away  how did you  feel when you  first heard  that that gift  was given away  I was a bit  livid  on that one  on that one  on that hockey  one that really  bothered him  that had to  that really  bugs him  how'd you find  out I didn't  tell you  you brought it  up on the  shit show  I did  yeah  you get very  loosey goosey  on that show  yeah the shit show  is wow 
[02:30:00]  a lot of people  open up  when did you  give him that  gift  Christmas  and when did  you find out  it was given  away  a couple weeks  ago  oh you just  found out  so you thought  maybe a month  ago  that it was  hanging in a  place of honor  it all makes  sense now  that was the  turning point  right there  over the mantle  perhaps  he was still in  until that point  well had you  been over  Opie's house  in between  the time you  gave him the gift  and the time you  found out he gave  it away  hell no  that's like five  months  oh wow  how many times  have you been  over it  in five months  it can't even  count right 
[02:30:30]  no way  that's a lot  I mean I thought  you were going  to say like  this week  five months  I don't know  how many times  I've been there  in five months  oh shit  oh shit  you know  wow man  so E-Rock  he really doesn't  have any place  to hang it  in that giant  living room  or dining room  or the other  bedroom  I have all  the hallways  half my place  is glass  but half isn't  three bathrooms  and you know  plenty of places  a lot of  hallways  I don't want to  disrespect him  and put it  in a bathroom  that's horrible  just get rid of it 
[02:31:00]  two and a half  bedrooms  oh shit  yeah just get rid of it  wow this is real  you also didn't  really search  it was 18 hours later  there wasn't a lot  of searching  I bet if I walk  if I walk through  Opie's house  with a video camera  I could find  at least ten  amazing places  to hang out  oh yeah  it has to be  now that's  twit pic worthy  do you have a lot  of things on your  walls at your house  oof  nope  no there's plenty  of space  a lot of space  but he probably  looked at that  and he felt like  I just don't care  about this gift 
[02:31:30]  what am I going to do  with this big  gaudy islanders thing  yeah this is not that good  give it to my brother  he's into this shit  yeah this is bullshit  yeah Eric and his wife  are standing there  holding hands  looking like  where's our picture  how tired  how tired would you get  like having to  talk about it  and explain it  if people come over  to your house  and it's like  hey well look at this  this is nice  and you have to be like  yay Eric got it for me  so you just figured  fuck this  let me get rid of it  I'm an asshole  I'm an asshole  with gifts  what can I tell you  not with mine 
[02:32:00]  I mean you use mine  a lot  my birthday is  soon  I think a couple days  after the earth ends  I'll be celebrating  a birthday  right after the earth  and I drive my wife  nuts too  because right around  this time  I go out and buy  everything I want  like look  she wanted to buy this  this would have been  a perfect fucking  birthday gift  but then you wouldn't have had it  that's what I try to tell her  that's what I say  and so I buy everything  I want  so then she has nothing  to buy me for my birthday  and you're the breadwinner  so you're buying it anyway 
[02:32:30]  either way  it frustrates her  so if you wanted  an Islanders signed  big thing  I would have bought it already  you'd have bought it yourself  yes  right  you didn't want it  to begin with then  no  it wasn't the walls  what did you think  honestly  what did you think  when you saw the  Islanders picture  honestly  my brother's gonna love this  honestly  if Billy Smith was on it  then I would have really loved it  it fell short  but that means  knowing me  and who my favorite Island  this is so painful 
[02:33:00]  it fell short  it fell short a little bit  Clark Gillies  yes  nice drum  not so much  not a big deal  I'm being reminded  a Mike Bossy  would have been nice on there  what about just like  a little signed puck  to put on your desk  or something  instead of that big giant  gauntlet  yes  that I would have kept  what are you being reminded of  you Rock  I'm being reminded that  is it your wife  now I have a problem with her  that we were there  for his son's christening  oh  and when we were at 
[02:33:30]  the apartment  I forgot that  she reminded me  she goes  I wonder if he had a chance  to hang it up yet  oh no  she asked you that  I forgot all about that  that's humiliating  because we didn't see it  and this is before  he admitted what he did with it  so she was looking for it  oh maybe he just hasn't had time  to hang it up yet  and I did say  this is several months  after Christmas  I know  it's like December 28th  oh no  so the wife noticed  yeah  Iraq hates you  yeah that was the turning point 
[02:34:00]  I knew things were  a little different recently  he feels like him and his wife  have been disrespected  in a very real way  oh well  and they had been  by the way  sure  what happened  and they had been  disrespected  in their eyes  are you going to buy  a birthday person  did I give you a birthday  fucking gift  that you enjoyed  the bottle of wine  was great  there you go  just a little simple  little thing  that I know  that Ann would have enjoyed  it's delicious  western echo on twitter  what's hysterical  is that  Opie doesn't want  Iraq's gifts back  he just wants  pictures sent to him 
[02:34:30]  so he gets the gift  let's go to Best Buy  and photo  the lost box  and you say  I gave that to you  and you're done  oh  wow that's venomous  the venom is coming out  finally  I didn't even realize  that you gave me  the lost box set  until today  oh he didn't even realize  poor Iraq  he doesn't like the fact  that he put so much  thought and feeling  into you  and he feels like  you have no thought  or real feeling  for him  well  if we want to go  that route  Opie and Anthony 
[02:35:00]  were both very generous  with their wedding gifts  oh well  when it's only cash  it's easy  did I not give you a gift  it was not cash  your gift was very nice  I know you had no idea  you got me a gift  but  it was nice  did I give you a gift  no I know what it was  oh  I actually meant to  I would  I don't do that  I know what it was  because it was on the  I'm sorry  it was on your list  why did you give Iraq  a wedding gift  and not me  because I figured  you could just get  whatever you want  like I do 
[02:35:30]  why don't you buy  a nice wedding gift  for Opie's brother  oh  oh damn  oh I feel bad  I didn't  I meant to  I was in  I was in fucking  Poughkeepsie that we got  can I just say  is it Poughkeepsie  I was  what does that mean  I was working  I was away  I forgot to do it  because I wasn't at the wedding  oh  it wasn't like I went  and stiffed the motherfucker  I didn't go to the wedding either  yeah but you were fucking  what were you doing  what were you doing  I don't know  probably drunk somewhere  he wasn't in your life  he was just  he wasn't in my life  what's going on this weekend 
[02:36:00]  I have no idea  Kenny can you make a note  to get me  I'm gonna get a $50 gift certificate  for that scumbag  wait I'm number one  on your fucking hate list  and I was the only one  in this room  that went to your fucking wedding  god damn  motherfucker  I was working though  I couldn't  he gave you a nice fucking cash gift  but it does help  how much you give him  it does help  and you're the only one  that got an invitation  to the wedding  I don't like discussing figures  I'm teasing of course  I don't like discussing figures  ever  it was a healthy  more than a hundred  sweatpants  way the fuck over a hundred 
[02:36:30]  sweatpants  way the fuck over a hundred  on sale  add some zeros my friend  alright so fucking  he gave you  oh oh oh oh  one dollar  and some zeros  and some decimal points  yeah that's right  or one decimal point  that's alright  idiot  why are people mad at me  that I give gifts away  if I don't  if I feel like  say it you don't want it  you're gonna say that  you stop yourself  you stop yourself  why are people mad at me  if I don't want a wall  right out of wall space  you're fucking pristine walls 
[02:37:00]  I could eat off your walls  there's nothing on them  some asshole gives me  an oil painting  and assumes that  I like oil painting  so what am I supposed to do  and I'm the only honest guy here  you're supposed to hang it up  in your house  for 30 fucking years  and hate it  some asshole gives you  an islanders  or do you give it to someone  that might appreciate it  my brother appreciates  that islander thing  man  he fucking  he fucking dusts it  whatever it every day  how much wall space  do you need for  Eric understands that  but he's hurt that  you didn't appreciate it  he knows your brother 
[02:37:30]  appreciates it  he wanted you to appreciate it  playing this up a little bit  for the show  sure  I appreciate it  yes  but I didn't know  what to do with it  and how much wall space  does the Lost box sets  take up  yeah exactly  I didn't want to watch Lost  the empty city  he assumes  that he has  no  you assume  that I wanted to watch Lost  because you thought  it was a good show  that's fine  I never had a desire  to watch this show  so when you gave me  the box set  I was appreciative  I said thank you  and I gave it to someone  that would want to watch it  what's wrong with that 
[02:38:00]  the problem is  people don't fucking tell  the person  that they gave the gifts away  many people give gifts away  but they never fucking tell the person  I don't think he minded  the Lost one as much  the Lost one is just like  a pop culture thing  but I think that the Islanders one  got to him so bad  because he knows you love the Islanders  you talk about them every day  you're a very loyal fan  and he and his wife together  put some thought into that  and that's different than the Lost thing  am I right or wrong?  yeah that is different  I just remembered  the wine rack that me and Jess gave you 
[02:38:30]  is still in your house too  oh shit  because that's when he was saying  he had all this wine  and then you thought  so we said  why would we get a wine rack  wine rack  right  what a thoughtful gift  it was very nice actually  we gave him  I think it was for his wedding  we gave him  a nice basket full of  different wines  which like he does  he quickly pulls up his computer  and goes to wine.com  and reviews  how good this wine is  based on the price  that's fucked up  what was his  what was his  what was his conclusion  no he was 
[02:39:00]  he approved  because it was over  a certain dollar amount  what's the dollar amount  50  okay  no it was a basket  like five or six different wines  and they were all over  a certain range  ah Dr. Steve  ah  Iraq puts a lot of thought  into Obie's gifts  there was a  there was a wine  I was going to get Anthony  that the guy suggested  in the store  and I looked it up  on my fucking phone  and saw it didn't make  the criteria  so I had to tell the guy  nope we got to go higher  motherfucker  so I live it  I live it in my own life  let me tell you something  I looked up that bottle  of wine that Obie got 
[02:39:30]  it was a damn good  bottle of wine  yes it was  and it tastes great  well while you two  are congratulating each other  we have a hurt boy  in that room  you know Jim  you said that Eric  gives really good gifts  and puts a lot of thought  into it  yeah  to Obie  yeah  I gotta kind of  go the other way  where it's  I kind of feel like  Eric is giving gifts  that like  a fan would know  to get Obie  oh  oh shit  hang on  that's one of the biggest  insults you could ever say  by the way  I'm just saying  because like  fanboy  like if I'm a fan  what do I know 
[02:40:00]  that Obie likes  well he likes  wine and the Islanders  so I'll just get him  wine and Islanders  stuff  and I think  maybe it's just a little  and I don't mean to smash it  but perhaps it's a little  too generic  oh shit  when he has enough money  to buy anything  he fucking wants  you try to find something  that like  he could use this  or he might enjoy that  even though he can  purchase that himself  yeah  this was the mistake  but the Islanders thing  is a little different  it was a mistake  he wouldn't seek that out  to go and get that  no it was a mistake  because it was  Clark Gillies  Nystrom  and I remember now  that it was 
[02:40:30]  Brian Trottier  Trottier  if it was Gillies  Smith  yeah  and a Bossy  now we're talking  that would have been  that would have been  adorning one of your walls  well then you would have  to know me for that shit  yeah  wait but there would be  wall space for that  oh yeah  oh shit  so it had nothing  to do with wall space  yeah what would you  have taken down  to put that up  or would you have  had a wall built  or just built  put it up  put it up where  there's a spot anyway  yeah it was  it was the three guy 
[02:41:00]  combo that was  a little off  yeah I like it  so you guys looked  out of the rock  and you and your  beautiful wife agreed  this is a cool gift  and you knew  that he looked at it  and went ugh  alright so it fell  a little short  next time we'll be there  yeah  if he went ugh  it was not to my face  it's a learning exercise  that's what I keep  trying to tell the kids  I get it  I get it  all this is learning exercises  this is life lessons  not just radio lessons  exactly  if he wants to look at you  like a father  he has to accept  the life lessons  that's fucking right  let me see if my twitter 
[02:41:30]  is blowing up to date  what's your twitter  opi radio  and Jimmy retweeted  one of my lines yesterday  motherfucker  it was funny  it was fucking  I don't remember  what the line was  but it made me laugh  actually I want to retweet  one of yours  feel free  the sofa towel  leave the black light on  I should have retweeted that  I don't know why I didn't  I owe you a RT today  holy mother of god  this has just been  so uncomfortable 
[02:42:00]  but I love Iraq  I live in this fucking world  let's go  I feel bad for poor Iraq  poor Iraq has a  he's a hurt boy  but it's good  that he gets this stuff  off his chest  he has so much pent up  he's got to get things  off his gut though  it's just not the time  he's hurting in there  there's a hurting boy  in that class  I get uncomfortable  around neediness  I'm sorry  but that's love  I think that's a love  I get uncomfortable  when things are a little  too needy  but that's love  I don't even know  if that was needy  don't get me wrong  Iraq is garbage  but I think that was love 
[02:42:30]  he loves you  Iraq should have bought  I don't have time  to go to you Jake  I'm sorry but it's great  Iraq should have bought  Beatles books  I was trying to figure out  a way to squeeze that in  but I knew  how much that bothered me  that hurt my feelings  but I didn't take it personally  I know  even though we  we got a great video  out of that  I could see in your face  that there was a party  that was a little  he wanted Ozzy  to take those  and be like  wow I really appreciate  there was a moment  where you like  turned from all the laughter 
[02:43:00]  to look at the books  and it's a great shot  of what Jimmy  was really feeling  because he did  and then he thought into it  and then he moved back  to laughing  with the rest of them  but there was a split second  where he was a hurt little boy  sure that's why I know  because what it does  it puts in perspective  where you are  in the mind of that person  right  now me  I'm an Ozzy fan  from you know  30 years  but I do realistically  understand that I'm not  high on his radar  but when something like that  brings it home  it makes me go like  ugh  like wince a little bit  right  but I get over it quickly 
[02:43:30]  because again  he fucking forgets everything  and he's Ozzy Osbourne  so you  this is a little harder  because I don't work with Ozzy  every day  I don't expect Ozzy to love me  he thought of Opie  as like an idol  but also at this point  a friend  and a co-worker  I'm under no illusions  look  that Ozzy is a co-worker  Iraq I'll help you out  for next time  like it's really tough  to buy for me  I like  it's not that tough  I like duck horn  cabernet  hoping a few of those  arrive just in time  for my birthday  why don't I just call Brett  and ask what he likes  oh  that's your brother's name 
[02:44:00]  what are you talking about  it was Scott  that got your Islanders  fucking shit  not the one with the restaurant  right  because Brett's sort of like me  to be honest with you  why don't you get him  a napkin holder  and Silver Oak  is a fine wine  Silver Oak  yes  cabernet  I'm a cabernet guy  Anthony is a fucking  I'm a Shiraz guy  I'm a Shiraz nut  but I do have a lot  of other ones  I'm actually having  a wine tasting  set up at the house  which always will not  be invited to  no it's just 
[02:44:30]  it's actually  usually just me  Keith and Danny  sit around  with a distributor  and I restock  my wine cellar  nice  and you know  you try out different wines  and figure what you want  what the fuck  happened to you  you used to fucking  take toilet lids off  and you're a garbage man  and fucking  Keith's a patrolman  and the three of you  are sitting around  like you're fucking  the queen  and her fucking  royal entourage  faggots  I don't turn down 
[02:45:00]  free alcoholic beverages  that's right  oh that's hilarious  by the way  oh god damn  my twitter has  blown up today  I've gained 20 followers  after all those mentions  oh wow  poor Iraq  I don't like to see  Iraq hurt  because Iraq  I gave him the  greatest fucking gift  a job  and my fucking  knowledge  oh shit  now give me a better  fucking Islanders poster  next time  and let's all relax  bossy 
[02:45:30]  bossy  I love how it's just  been boiled down  to a poster  that's it  you want a fucking  bumper sticker  yeah  print me out a better  picture at Kinko's  a job  and at least  20 some odd years  of knowledge  remember  Iraq  so how about you  you made a sex bagel  a household  bossy  that's how you  can remember it  you don't even know  hockey  obviously  so you ask around  wow he's an Islander fan  who does he fucking  like from the old days  yeah  have I bought you guys  any gifts  I don't think so 
[02:46:00]  we don't give gifts  nah we're not big  gift givers  we give the gift of  laughter to our audience  Jimmy gave me a fine  check for my wedding  yes I did  and we all know  I don't need money  but Jimmy made sure  he fucking  acknowledged  that special day  what about the  money  in the bag  well I said that  and he said  nobody's going to  steal that  not here  and then I said  all this money  if anybody else  is winning  a lot  all wrong  oh Iraq  I love you  oh there you go 
[02:46:30]  Iraq  everything's okay  everything's fine now  I'm sure  I'm sure he'll have  a lot to say  during the shit hour  I was going to  I was going to say  thank God  it's all settled  and taken care of  and won't be brought up  on the shit hour  his wife has to hear that  because I'm sure  Sam will just move on  from this  yeah I don't want  to get into this  I don't like conflict  oh no  without getting too  personal or anything  Iraq  just a generalization  how does your wife  feel about this  we know your wife  she's very lovely  a great girl  way out of your league  you're hitting way  out of your league  oh yeah  she's slumming 
[02:47:00]  how does she feel  about a situation  like this  she  I was texted  that she picked out  both the wine  and the islanders thing  so she  the wine thing  she played off  but the islanders thing  yes she was disappointed  oh disappointed  how does she feel  about the way  Opie treats you  that's a good one  we won't go into that  oh shit  a few late night  chit chats  how does she  come on  how does she feel  about the way  come on 
[02:47:30]  you can say it  holy shit  I'm not even  listening to you  because guess  what's in the mail  as we speak  oh  that fucking  suction device  autographed  fucking hockey card  that's incredible  you gotta hang that up  I fucking have a spot  for that  so now wait  what did she say  about the way  Opie treats you  come on  what'd she say to you  wow this is gonna  end friendships today  I love this  did she say  what'd she say  I was starting to think  I had too many friends  anyway  you gotta start  thinning out the  herds  E-Rock's a little hurt  did she say 
[02:48:00]  hey Eric  does he really  not like you  or did she ask you  something  or did she say it  no  not getting into that  crunched in her statement  you're an asshole  that's a fair question  does that mean  she said some shit  so now we can't be friends  anymore  I just don't want to  bring her into this  conversation anymore  than I need to  no it's fair enough  we have a civilian rule  but that's not  if you don't want to  bring your civilians  onto the show  we don't push that  that's all it is  I just don't want to  bring her more  into this  than I need to  okay how about this  let me rephrase  what have you heard  it might not mean by her  but what have you heard  that kind of pointed out 
[02:48:30]  that your relationship  was a little unequal  I mean I'm sure  somebody must have said  something to you  if not her  then another friend  do the people close to you  comment on the way  Opie treats you  I mean like Sam  all the time  no but other people  who are in your  personal life  there's really no one  in my personal life  that knows him  but they know the  relationship on the radio  on the radio  they don't know  they know that your  gifts are hustled out  faster than  they do now  and I'm sure it's  number one on the  countdown  after he became  a restaurant partner  you see that 
[02:49:00]  you get an islander's  gift in through the  front door  out through the back  you get wine  out the back door  you should see the  gifts that end up  in the garbage chute  because I don't like  clutter  oh no  oh yeah  by the way  back scratchers  I have my first  E-Rock tweet  nice  is in  it says  Anthony Cumia  hey you watching  the news  very funny  I'll retweet you  and that way  you'll get some  of my watching  the news  twitter thing  though  hey we're just 
[02:49:30]  talking between  friends  why don't you  stay out of this  I'm sorry  and I tweeted  to E-Rock  to try to get him  some more followers  yeah  so I did  it's beautiful  I wrote  please be nice  to E-Rock radio  the poor angel  feels unloved  do not  chip bomb him  it will make him  feel silly  I love you  do not  chip bomb  no do not  do not  write things  about him  with a  I was wondering  what that was  because a lot  of responses 
[02:50:00]  just go  there's nothing  by the way  that makes me  happier than  a twitter chip  bombing  me and Sam  were going  back and forth  yesterday  because  that's what  friends do  that's right  I photo  bombed  one of Sam's  pictures yesterday  and it was on  E-Rock's camera  so I kept  writing E-Rock  like what the  fuck  I want to  tweet this  picture  E-Rock  and I was  frustrated  and I wrote  Sam  where's that  fucking picture  and Sam  writes 
[02:50:30]  E-Rock moves  like molasses  oh  that's like  slow right  very slow  oh okay  E-Rock  would I say  that to your  face  fuck yeah  exactly  that's why  it's a great  E-Rock behind  my back  E-Rock is a  very thoughtful  guy  and I told  him that  one time  he got me  we were going  to get pictures  with Carol  Burnett  and he bought  me a Carol  Burnett book  I gave him  the money  for it  but it was  like that he  thought oh  you might  want to get  this sign  and I said  you're a  thoughtful  guy  thoughtful  boy  very  thoughtful  good  Eric's 
[02:51:00]  a good  friend  I will  agree with  you  Eric retouched  a photo  for me  two years  afterwards  and I didn't  even ask  for it  it's weird  wow  yes  he's very  thoughtful  get rid of  did he draw  you in  what  there's random  acts of kindness  that Eric does  for apparently  no reason  because no one's  kind back  isn't it more  a cry for help  and love  than it is  I don't know  what it is  but Eric  Eric went out  of his way 
[02:51:30]  to get one  of my Carrie  Byron pictures  printed out  and signed  I didn't ever  ask him to do  it  but he just  did  and I thought  I thanked  him for it  he's a nice  guy  Eric is a genuinely  nice guy  that is a nice  thing to do  why would you  do that  he comes from  money  he's not a  spoiled rich  kid  he's a fucking  nice guy  hey scout  when you get  the Islanders  poster  I want to  tweet that  today  thanks  he was born  with a silver  he was born  with a silver  shovel in his  mouth  I left 
[02:52:00]  I left a message  from my  brother  so  you should  get it  a silver  show  oh  that was  hurtful  oh  it was a  goddamn  good one  I apologize  Iraq  but I'm  number one  right  Iraq  I'm gonna  keep reminding you  I see a lot of  mentions are coming  in on your  Twitter  oh are they  yeah  yeah I'll read a few  sis sis  you're a trooper  sis 
[02:52:30]  Iraq  like he boulder  or something  he boulder  sis sis  or something  there's nothing  better than a  fucking chip  frenzy  I think we can  all agree on  that  a chip  frenzy  like little  piranhas  going sis  sis  with their  chip teeth  something about  getting a good  boy phone  getting bad  reception  or something  poor Iraq 
[02:53:00]  he's such a  sweet kid  he is sweet  he's a sweet  boy  all around  sweet  nice guy  and just  gets the  brunt  of the  shit  here  he does  nice guy  things that  aren't even  needy  though  like he's  just a  thoughtful  guy  him getting  me that  Carol Burnett  book  was  because I  gave him  the money  for it  it was just  a thoughtful  thing  like he  realized I  would probably  want that  and he was  like oh  you know  what  that was  a very  nice gift  he doesn't  work out  with me  you give  the shit  away  maybe you're  not paying  close enough  attention 
[02:53:30]  yeah if you  were a little  more thoughtful  towards Obi  you would get  him something  he wants  hey I got  this for you  great throws  it on the  floor try  again  and do  you try  again  yes you  do  Eric do  you think  if you dropped  weight and got  all cut  they'd still  fuck with  you like  this  oh I'd  start  punching  wow  dude I  can fucking  fight  I'll fight  you right  the fuck  now  why does  that motivate  you though  get big  get a little  bulk  and then no  one's  gonna make a lot 
[02:54:00]  of sense  if Opie and  Iraq fought  I would put  my  Opie's a better  fighter  he's in better  shape  I'd put my  money on  Iraq though  yes because  no  are you saying  that  no because  Iraq has a  bull rage  there's a rage  there  he's the  stocky kid  you don't want  pushing you up  again  he outweighs  you  Iraq  could be  talking to  everybody in  the building  and I want you  to take this  with what I  mean it as  Iraq is the  retarded kid  that everybody  has been flicking  rubber bands at  and when he  snaps  everyone's like  oh my god  I didn't know  he was that 
[02:54:30]  strong and  thick wristy  Eric is the  bully in the  bully video  he's not  the victim  in the bully  video  but retarded  he's just  going to  pick someone  up  me and  Iraq will  be the  undercard  of the  Ian Halperin  fucking  that big  brawl  where's the  ring outside  the building  next week  apparently  it's right  outside  we'll be  the undercard  thousands of  people there  Oscar de la  Hoya  refereeing  oh yes  I was talking  to a girl  last night  who had  on like  fucking  what the

[03:14:00]  no problem  with Don  but I found  out  the antisocial  in DC  was being  I didn't  know this  Mike's show  was I guess  plugging it  or something  or helping  to promote  it  I had no  idea  and so we  were all  doing  phoners  but like  he wouldn't  let me  call in  and I had  like mixed  feelings about  Mike wouldn't  let you  call in  yeah  we buried  that shit  that's what  I'm saying  I guess  he didn't  but I was  but I don't  think Mike  wow  alright let's  go with  that's weird  I think  Don 
[03:14:30]  we went  after Don  way harder  than Mike  Mike actually  even through  that weird  period  was kind  of cool  to us  but he  wouldn't have  me on  the show  and again  that's his  prerogative  he did  promote the  show  so I can't  motherfuck the  guy  because honestly  he promoted  the show  he didn't say  fuck it  does he  think there's  still an issue  it doesn't  make any sense  we made it  very very public  that we're  done with that  as soon as  Don's wife  was killed  it just felt  silly  to be  fucking  it felt  silly  to have a  dumb radio  fight  I had no  desire to keep  that going  and it didn't  it ended that  day and there  was nothing  more to it  it was like 
[03:15:00]  I never had  any animosity  for real  it ended  that day  I'm like  who gives  a fuck  about a  dumb radio  fucking war  when that  shit happened  to somebody  I was surprised  that Mike  still holds  I guess  a grudge  if I literally  if I would  have just  called in  that's weird  I wouldn't  have even  known it  was him  but I went  up doing  the sports  junkies  who are  better friends  to us  anyway  but still  it was  an odd  Kirk  and Mike  he's doing  Kirk  and Mike  I didn't  even know  I know  Don's doing  his own  thing out  there  where is  he now  California  right  who Don's  out in  California  Sacramento  is he on  the radio  he's PD 
[03:15:30]  of the station  out there  now  is he on  the air  too  I think  so yeah  so they  broke up  angrily  or do you  think Don  just needed  to change  the scenery  it's kind  of like  this show  it was just  time  I really  don't know  the Mike  O'Mara  show  sorry  it's funny  why don't we  announce  who wants  to do it  I don't  have to  yes  Mark  Parento 
[03:16:00]  will be  joining  that's right  the virus  that's right  this is a big  young black  yes the young  black and crying  show  let me do it  this way  let me do it  this way  Jim  and then we  could all  talk about  this  there's a  short list  of people  I would  love to  have on  this  channel  that's  true  I would  love to  have  Jim  Brewer  I would  love to  have  Bill  Burr  I would  love to  have  Patrice  O'Neil  as far  as  you want  the  antisocial  network  on this  show  exactly  actual  like  guys  that  could  pull  off  a  show  yes  those  are  those  are  those 
[03:16:30]  are  three  and this  guy's  right  right  with  them  as well  he  certainly  is  and he's  been a  good  friend  to this  show  for a  long  time  I  know  him  for  many  years  and  he's  become  a  loyal  motherfucker  very  loyal  guy  and  he's  become  a  very  much  more  famous  guy  in  the  last  few  years  and  has  not  wavered  in  loyalty  at  all  he's  a  good  guy  he's  a  good  dude  it's  scorched  no  we're  not  that  lucky  so  we  want  to  welcome  Joe  Rogan  Joe 
[03:17:00]  Rogan  yes  it's  Joe  Rogan  everybody  his  podcast  is  fucking  great  I've  done  it  once  we  sat  in  Kevin  Smith  smodcast  and  did  two  and a  half  hours  I  called  Joe  that  day  and  he  they  fucking  great  they  do  a  great  podcast  my  boys  down  in  Philly  they  listen  to  only  us  and  Joe  Rogan's  podcast  that's  what  they  listen  to  and  we 
[03:17:30]  couldn't  be  happier  that  the  Joe  Rogan  experience  joins  the  virus  so  fucking  happy  so  smoke  a lot  of  marijuana  and  listen  to  Joe  Rogan  here  on  the  virus  and  I  probably  couldn't  have  more  opposite  conspiracy  feelings  or  politics  from a  guy  than  I  do  Rogan  and  I  fucking  love  him  and  I  love  the  show  but  that's  why  I hate  when  people  feel like  they  have  to  agree  to  like  it  because  I  don't  we  say  that  about  our  own  show  we're  like  look  we're  not  there  are  radio  shows  out  there  that  want 
[03:18:00]  you  to  agree  with  the  radio  show  in  general  and  we're  one  of  those  shows  that  say  no  you  don't  Sunday  starting  at  9  o'clock  in the  morning  Eastern  6  AM  West  ends  at  9  PM  so  basically  this  Sunday  you're  getting  12  hours  of  Joe  Rogan  podcast  back  to  back  to  back  to  back  to  back  to  back  back  back  back 
[03:18:30]  back  back  back  and  then  the  virus  the  show  is  going to  move  to  its  regular  air  times  starting  Memorial  Day  weekend  we're  going to  hear  them  Saturdays  at  noon  Eastern  Sundays  at  5  AM  and  6  PM  so  he's  getting  three  plays  on  the  weekend  which  is  great  because  he gives  you  three  totally  different  times  to  hear  that  yes  Joe  Rogan  yes  the  Joe  Rogan  experience  his  podcast  is  extremely 
[03:19:00]  popular  and  it's  fucking  it's  fun  to  do  man  I  would  love  to  do  that  again  when  I'm  out  there  it's  fucking  fun  oh  look at  these  people  please  tell  me  the  it's  been  canceled  no  no  no  we're  expanding  that  too  in the  near  future  expanding  it  United  and  Continental  unveil  aligned  services  boy are  Continental  users  flyers  getting  fucked  that's  great  they keep  the  Continental  tail  little  globe  thing  but they  painted  United  over  the 
[03:19:30]  windows  yeah  because  they're  one  airline  now  so  yeah  you're  all  fucked  so  my  loyalty  to  Continental  is  over  it's  American  now  even  though  they  fucked  me  on the  luggage  and  everything  but it  was  weather  related  I mean  they  couldn't  really  any  airline  would have  fucked up  on that  one  but I  like  American  like American  airlines  I got  fired from  that job  look at  that  I was  doing  exercises  with my  red  wig  and they  fired me  from  McDonald  land  yeah 
[03:20:00]  Ronald  McDonald  under  pressure  to fire  Ronald  McDonald  why  people  want  him  fired  because  they're  saying  the food  is not  healthy  for  children  and  they  want  to  get  rid  of  happy  meals  or  anything  that  you  know  how  sometimes  they  said  that  cigarettes  were being  marketed  to  children  through  things like  that camel  with the big  balls  that was  to women  that was being  marketed to  women  was it  yes  honestly  that was  a subliminal  thing for  women  subliminal  yes  and when  they say  any cartoony  character  they were saying  was marketed 
[03:20:30]  to  children  but  I don't  know  yeah  I could  say  it's  kind  of  a  dick  balls  oh  it  is  but  they're  saying  that  having  the clown  and the  happy meal  and the  toys  and having  fried food  and all that  is bad  for the  children  so they  want  McDonald's  to get  rid of  any  kind  of  marketing  tool  that  is  based  on  the  children  do we  have  to  fucking  legislate  everything  I  understand  childhood  obesity  is one  thing  but  can  fucking  parents  ever 
[03:21:00]  just  do  their  fucking  jobs  I'm  so  sick  of  the  rest  of  us  not  that  I  care  about  happy  meals  but  what  if  you  do  it  with  your  good  parent  and  your  kid  is  skinny  and  once  in a  while  you  want  to  buy  the  kid  a  happy  meal  why does  everybody  have to  suffer  because  a lot  of  parents  can't  control  their  fucking  fat  pig  children  how about  you  just  order  a  cheeseburger  and  a  small  soda  and  fry  I don't  understand  it  myself  I don't  know  I kind  of like  a fat 
[03:21:30]  kid  I feel  like  they're  a little  older  more  cushion  for the  pushing  it  always  comes  down  to the  same  jokes  it  sure  does  you've  never  seen  a  room  full  of  people  leaping  for  one  pedophile  joke  it's  amazing  like  it  was  a  gold  bullion  fucking  this  show  should  be  called  easy  easier  and  easiest  it  really  is  just  sad  gosh  oh 
[03:22:00]  gosh  darn it  cigars  and scotch  gets credit  for the  radio  chick  rumor  oh  he  started  that  one  right  on  cigars  that's  a good  one  I had  to go  on  twitter  did  sniffing  pick  it  up  or  did  he  actually  say  sniffing  picked  it  up  oh  I  know  I  don't  know  I  read  either  but  he  said  something  like  Alan  sniffing  reporting  that  the  radio  chick  is  going  to  the  virus  so  maybe  he  just  used  that  to  get  some  cred  dude  people  were  fucking  screaming 
[03:22:30]  at me  on twitter  it's  gonna  fuck  up  the  west  coast  feed  and  I'm  like  you're  losing  west  coast  audience  we didn't  say  anything  dude  this is  why  I  actually  tweeted  my  fucking  I  had that  hang  with  Aziz  and  Zari  and  we're  gonna  be  at  work  at  three  I  twittered  like  are  you  guys  talking  about  the  Aziz  I  had  no  idea  what  they  meant  I  thought  that  was  a joke  what  you  know  I  was  serious  because  I'm  like  why 
[03:23:00]  would  they  be  saying  I'm  gonna  lose  half  the  fucking  people  I'm  like  well  that  interview  airs  Friday  at  six  so  maybe  the  west  coast  three  o'clock  people  think  that  they  can't  hear  it  I  didn't  know  if  we  could  get  bill  burr  and  patrice  on  this  damn  channel  then  maybe  we  could  get  another  channel  going  bill's  here  tomorrow  isn't he  yeah  bill's  in town  he's  at  he's  at  caroline  so  he's  got  an  open  door  because  he  lives  on  the  west  coast  whenever  he's  in  New  York  he's  just  allowed  to  fucking  come  through  that  yeah  yes  of course  I  just  saw  bill 
[03:23:30]  I'll  be  happy  to  see  him  again  hello  bill  you  got a  brewer  phone  call  did  I  I  got a  brewer  phone  call  no  but  I  saw  Jim  and  I  had  a  lovely  time  he  suggestions  for 
[03:24:00]  that  for  him  nice  chat  I  like  the  clandestine  shit  it's  just  private  friend  stuff  that's  right  but  yeah  it  was  fun  I  had a  great  talking  among  friends  I  had  nice  dinner  with  fucking  with  with  fucking  bill  and  Dave  one  night  and  then  the  next  day  Jim  and  I  went  out  and  did  radio  together  while  Dave  and  Bill  did  Mike  show  Jim  and  I  did  the  sports  show  having  problems 
[03:24:30]  and  Attell  kind  of  plays  both  sides  you know  because  he's  a  you  know  what  you  have  to  do  like  this  stiffen  up  those  lips  let's  go  home  yeah  we  should  you  know  we  didn't  do  any  shit  today  at  all  the  only  thing  we  did  is  a  quick  holy  shit  Reggie  Jackson  is  65  that  was  the  only  thing  we  did  today 
[03:25:00]  that  that  made  this  show  sound  current  whatever  it's  one  of  those  shows  now  we  can  play  anytime  and  no one  will  know  when  it  is  not  even  if  we  say  something  like  the  fucking  woman  who  that  guy  allegedly  raped  lives  in a  house  or  apartment  that  are  only  given  out  to  HIV  positive  people  and  she's  lived  in  two  in  a  row  oh  boy  I  think  that's  what  the  rumor  is  hope  he  got  a  little  blood  on  an  open  sore  on  his  dick  dude  if  that  guy  if  she  has  AIDS  and  he  raped  her  and  he  got  AIDS  just  in 
[03:25:30]  case  you  have  Dominique  fucking  Klaus  Strauss  Kahn  you're  right  Strauss  Kahn  I  cannot  think  of a  better  thing  if  he  fucking  force  fed  his  cock  to  someone  and  she  possibly  has  the  virus  he's  Nick  nervous  and  jail  unshaven  suicide  watch  good  I  think  they  do  that  maybe  he  spread  that  rumor  around  so  he  doesn't  get  fucked  in  the  ass  unless  someone  goes  I  have  AIDS

[03:30:00]  agreement  never  this could be  the first  time ever  and now that  i say this  it'll turn  because we  have assholes  what was it  they all love  that we just  announced joe rogan  has joined the  channel  oh  i've been looking  at the feedback  the phones  and the twitter  and nothing but  fucking holy shit  i saw one person  said rogan sucks  i didn't see one  it's like wow  what really  does he  he has to be  different i guess  everyone pumped  so we'll have  i'm not pumped  we'll have more
