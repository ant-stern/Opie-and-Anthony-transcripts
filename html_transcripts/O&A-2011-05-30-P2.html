<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with E-Rock and Primetime Sam Roberts hosting a “Worst Of” segment focusing on the show’s most uncomfortable interviews.  This segment teased upcoming interviews with George Wendt, Dax Shepard, and Donald Rumsfeld.  The main focus was a highly contentious off-site interview with Ed Asner at a World Poker Tournament in Los Angeles, with Joe Rogan filling in for Anthony.  Opie’s aggressive questioning led to a heated exchange, culminating in Asner angrily telling Opie to “fuck you” and leaving the interview. The hosts reacted with amusement. The conversation touched on poker, politics (including Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh), and Asner's career.  A preview of a less confrontational, but still awkward, interview with George Wendt was also shown.  This preview focused on Wendt’s book about beer, his post-*Cheers* career, and his drinking habits, with the hosts frequently commenting on his drinking and appearance. Wendt admitted to drinking almost nightly and discussed the financial challenges following his television success. Listener calls and commentary on television comedy were also included.

The full George Wendt interview followed, revealing an awkward encounter due to a scheduling misunderstanding and Wendt’s discomfort with the conversation's direction, particularly its focus on his personal struggles with alcohol.  The hosts attempted to relate to Wendt’s experiences, resulting in an uncomfortable exchange about his “demons.”  Wendt left early, leaving the hosts feeling awkward and concerned.  This was followed by a discussion of the Tucker Max interview, presented as another "Most Uncomfortable Interviews" segment. Max recounted explicit and unbelievable stories involving excessive drinking, sexual encounters, and various mishaps.  Listeners expressed skepticism and accused Max of lying.  Technical difficulties with a wireless microphone further complicated the interview.

The show then transitioned to a phone interview with Donald Rumsfeld promoting his memoir.  The interview covered his career, political views (Middle East, 2012 election), and legacy.  A significant portion involved Louis C.K.’s repeated, absurd questions about Rumsfeld being a lizard person.  This was preceded by Jimmy Norton recounting a sexually explicit and vulgar anecdote, prompting uncomfortable laughter from the hosts.  Callers continued to express amusement or skepticism about Tucker Max’s stories, including a claim about an ostrich.  Max himself called in to defend himself against accusations of lying.

The broadcast culminated in a confrontation with Bernie Getz, a “subway vigilante.” Following a discussion about *Weekly World News*, Opie's actions regarding Getz's CD, titled "Haunted Pussy," escalated into a shouting match, with Getz storming out before returning after apologies and explanations.  The incident involved shouting, physical gestures, and the potential for physical violence. The hosts apologized for the prank.  This incident was revisited later in the show, further detailing the misunderstanding over the CD, Bernie's furious outburst, and the hosts' repeated apologies.  Eric acted as a buffer.  The segment then transitioned to an interview with Steve the Whistler, a world champion whistler, which was plagued by technical difficulties with the CD player interrupting Steve’s demonstrations. Opie's attempts to whistle along added to the awkwardness.  Despite the technical issues, the interview covered Steve's career, competitions, and techniques, interspersed with inappropriate jokes and banter, and Jimmy Norton's inability to whistle.

The show also included an interview with Willem Dafoe, covering his career, views on the film industry (pressure of box office success vs. artistic merit, formulaic scripts vs. independent cinema), specific films (*The Last Temptation of Christ*, *Animorph*), and his experiences with negative reviews. He described an intensely physical crucifixion scene and an awkwardly filmed passionate kiss.

A studio visit from Lingerie Bowl participants and comedian Patrice O'Neal followed. O'Neal’s interactions with the Lingerie Bowl participants were highly confrontational and sexually charged, leading to an argument and one woman leaving the studio after O'Neal aggressively insulted her attire with offensive language.  The segment included attempts by Opie and Anthony to mitigate the situation, subsequent discussion of O'Neal's behavior, and a brief apology to the departing woman.

Finally, the show featured a phone interview with Richard Jenney, conducted as a prank "prison style" from outside the studio.  This caused initial anger from Jenney, who felt it was asinine and juvenile, but he eventually found humor in it.  The conversation included discussion of Jenney's previous appearance on Ron and Fez, jokes (including a knock-knock joke), riffing about Ron Jeremy (who was mentioned as an upcoming guest), and multiple caller interactions, some expressing frustration with the hosts' treatment of Jenney.  Jenney was eventually invited into the studio, concluding with further banter about his past career and pornography.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the O.P.N. Anthony Show.  Rageous Borderline Illegal Audio Entertainment.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  In honor of Memorial Day, 
[00:00:30]  we pause to honor fallen guests of the O.P.N. Anthony Show.  Brave souls who valiantly jumped into the fray,  only to be smashed in the rubble of a radio segment gone horribly, horribly awry.  However, these guests did not suffer in vain.  Their torment is now your joy.  This is the Worst of O.P.N. Anthony Presents  ONA's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  Welcome, everybody, to another fun-filled, themed Worst of.  This one being, for Memorial Day, 
[00:01:00]  my name is E-Rock, and he is Primetime Sam Roberts.  You didn't say what the theme was.  I'm not good. Who cares?  E-Rock.  Today, the O.P.N. Anthony Show is presenting  the most uncomfortable moments in interview show history.  I take that back.  This is a very good show.  It is.  Because O.P.N. Anthony are known for a lot of things.  And one of the things they've become known for throughout their careers  is the amount of uncomfortable moments they have with guests.  And we at the O.P.N. Anthony Show decided 
[00:01:30]  what better way than to celebrate this...  What better way to celebrate this day off with you  than to play some of the most uncomfortable interview moments  in show history.  So let's get started.  Eric, before we get started...  In here...  We gotta tease a little bit.  Let's get it started.  You know how much trouble we'll get in?  Let's get it started.  In here...  You're talking George Wendt from Cheers.  You're talking Dax Shepard.  You're talking Donald Rumsfeld.  I'm not talking to these people.  No, I'm saying you're talking, not talking to. 
[00:02:00]  But E-Rock, before we do all that...  Let's get it started.  No.  In here.  Let's light this candle.  That again?  Yeah.  Well, you're not using it anywhere else.  I guess we had to break here.  Just start the thing.  Sam...  Eric!  Ah, you got me.  Jinx.  Sam, this is when we had Ed Asner on the show.  And it wasn't in studio because this was one of those unique situations  where the company actually let the show...  Travel.  That company, not this company.  Oh, not the current company. 
[00:02:30]  World Poker Tournament.  In Los Angeles.  Yeah, it was a great set of shows.  Joe Rogan was sitting in for Anthony, who was out playing poker.  And we got to talk to an entertainment icon at this point just about Ed Asner.  He was also in the tournament.  This was the famous moment, and you long-term fans have heard it many times, heard about it.  It's the stuff of legend.  When Opie became the Destroyer.  It's Ed Asner and Opie the Destroyer on Opie and Anthony's most uncomfortable interviews. 
[00:03:00]  O&A's most uncomfortable interviews.  Do you have an update, Steve?  Travel Mike.  What's the update?  I don't know.  He ran to the table panicking.  No, it's not a panic.  It's Kenny got Ed Asner to come over.  Oh, good.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Good.  Here he comes.  Here we go.  Holy shit.  Lou Grant, baby.  Holy shit.  Lou Grant.  Come on.  How do you like that?  He has no idea what show he's going on.  I guarantee you.  Oh, wow.  Hello, sir.  Have a seat.  Mr. Asner. 
[00:03:30]  Hello, Mr. Asner.  It's a pleasure.  Fine.  Fine.  Mr. Asner.  No, I said mine.  Oh, okay.  I thought you said, yeah, fine.  I'm not that overcome.  I'm Opie.  Joe Rogan from Fear Factor.  How are you doing?  Pleasure to meet you.  Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing.  How are you doing?  And Jim Norton.  I loved you in JFK.  Thank you, Jim.  I loved you in a lot of things.  I actually recently watched a documentary that you narrated on the drug war in Columbia.  It was really good.  Yeah, it was a nice piece.  Really, really good.  Really fascinating. 
[00:04:00]  So what happened?  You got knocked out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You fall asleep.  You got tired.  You fell asleep?  No.  You just got bored out there?  Figuratively.  Why?  You just got bored?  The table was like, not much action at the table?  And I didn't play well.  Yeah.  I think, isn't that the bottom line?  I didn't play well.  Yeah.  Do you play all the time?  No.  I play straight poker.  Seven, seven and five.  And I'm still new to Texas Hold'em. 
[00:04:30]  It's a great game.  It's taking over the country, though.  I know.  It's a contest of smelling the shorts on the other players.  Yeah.  Excellent way of putting that.  I know.  I never thought Texas Hold'em could be hot.  I don't mean that sexually.  Oh, I know.  Don't we mean everything sexually, really?  I used to. 
[00:05:00]  Mr. A lot of people feel like, I'm not a big poker player.  My friend loves poker.  Do you feel that in a tournament setting, the cameras and the lights kind of make the  whole thing just like, you know, boom?  What does boom mean?  Like, just the whole, like, the intensity of the whole thing because of the cameras and  lights might set it up differently than, like, under other things.  I really don't, I mean, I am very, I don't think I'm that much more excited.  What's that?  No, I'm just trying to give the mic.  I don't think I'm that much more excited than if I were playing in a high-stakes game in 
[00:05:30]  a house.  In this particular game, starting out, of course, I'm very relieved that it's not my  money that I'm playing with.  Were you the first to go at your table?  Yeah.  Kind of embarrassing, huh?  What's your name?  Remember, Anthony.  He hates spunk.  Yes.  Anthony.  You're not a saint, are you?  No. 
[00:06:00]  You figured that out right off the bat.  And you never will be.  No, no.  And I don't claim to be.  Yeah, no.  No, but then, but then.  Well, what do you want us to ask?  The first charging up the hill to take the hill, who gets killed, is not necessarily  a loser.  I didn't say you were a loser.  Yes, you implied this much.  Look, you know what?  I'm smart.  No, he didn't piss me off.  No, I'm smart.  I don't like that implication at all.  I don't like that implication.  I can't believe you're doing that.  He's trying to show that he's better than I am. 
[00:06:30]  I don't like that at all.  He really is.  No, I mean, you survived 20 minutes.  That's not bad.  20 minutes.  Once again, he's belittling me.  Unbelievable.  Disrespect.  I don't do that.  He sounds like a drug lord to me.  He looks like it, too.  I couldn't sit at these tables.  No?  No, the guy I do the radio show with, he was brave enough to get in there.  I'm not claiming to be brave enough.  But he wouldn't give you the money?  No, they know he was better for this than I.  No.  I'm good at just being a jerk.  I don't know. 
[00:07:00]  Now, don't backtrack, please.  Okay, go ahead.  Let's move on.  Let's move on a little bit, please.  Backtrack.  Is there an awkward feeling at that?  Not at all.  I just don't like the fact that you implied that about Mr. Asner.  He's here to help out with the radio show.  How dare you?  Well, there's still three, four hundred pounds still playing.  Let's see.  He made me a loser.  And then he called himself a jerk.  Now, does that equate?  Well, I didn't say you were a loser.  Yes, you did.  No, no, no.  Yes, you did.  No.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, no. 
[00:07:30]  Where are we going with this?  Where's the car crash now when you need it?  Look at the sweat coming off my forehead.  I'm usually pretty good at this, but I'm losing this one, buddy.  Do you think that in this day and age that I would condemn you?  I mean, I've had to deal with people like Sean Hannity.  Sean's a good friend of ours.  Is he?  Yeah.  I don't agree with his politics, but he's a good friend of ours.  Why?  We were on his show a few times.  He's no conservative.  I don't like conservatives at all.  What's your opinion of him? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Of Sean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I think he's a mannequin.  What's a mannequin?  That's a big word for me.  You don't know what a mannequin is?  Oh, a mannequin mannequin.  He's very stiff.  Right.  Oh, no.  He's not stiff, but he's too pretty.  He really is too.  He really should be modeling clothes.  Yeah.  He doesn't belong on TV.  He really doesn't belong on TV.  Only ugly people should be on TV, right?  I think, you know, Sean is very good in this day and age because he has such a warped political ideology 
[00:08:30]  that seems to be going very well right now.  Big Bush reporter.  Yeah.  So I'm, you know.  You're the biggest dick.  No, I'm not.  Hannity is like that.  He's absolutely right.  Hannity is a very, very conservative pundit.  Well, you weren't aware of that, Anthony?  No.  That's not really Anthony.  That's Opie.  He's lying.  What's his name?  His real name is Opie.  Opie.  I see.  Anthony's playing cards.  I see.  I can't let this happen.  The great Asner.  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you.  Ed, can I ask you a question?  Do you feel like you were on?  Where is this radio show heard?  This is XM.  All over the country.  All over the country.  In this casino.  I have a question.  Have you ever heard the Banana Foam?  No.  It's a great song.  We'll play it going in a break or something.  You were on one of the greatest shows in history.  One of the greatest comedies to ever be on television.  Do you feel that, like, what do you think about the comedy today?  Do you think it's watered down on television, what they're passing off as comedy?  How do you feel about the comedies that are on now?  I'm a fan.  I love Curb Your Enthusiast.  Yeah.  Great show. 
[00:09:30]  That's my favorite show.  I like that a lot.  I don't watch that either.  But, unfortunately, I don't watch the others.  What do you like?  I like Mary Tyler Moore.  I like...  What do you mean now?  Nothing.  Nothing.  You look back at the old shows like Sanford and Son, All in the Family.  There was so much better.  There was so much better.  The sitcoms were so much better.  But Mary Tyler Moore, everybody in the show got their own spin-off show.  Everybody.  From the Weatherman, Gordon.  They all had their own show. 
[00:10:00]  That's how good it was.  It was a great fucking show.  That was a great observation.  You didn't know that?  Everyone.  Of course I did.  No, you didn't.  You can say fuck on that show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's totally uncensored.  It's phenomenal.  Who do you want to curse out first?  Well, let's see.  Did we cover Hannity all the way?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Who's left?  Rush Limbaugh.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  The Herman Goering of radio. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, nice.  No, I don't have a...  But Kerry just didn't have a shot.  He didn't stand up for anything during the election.  Well, he did tend to self-destruct, didn't he?  I mean, I was rooting for him.  The weirdest thing to me was how everybody just threw Dean down the sewer after that one crazy speech.  I think he was one crazy speech.  But it wasn't crazy.  You don't even know what happened there, do you?  I do.  No, I do.  He doesn't know.  Can I show my knowledge?  What's your knowledge?  He was yelling because he couldn't be heard. 
[00:11:00]  That's all.  Do you understand that they gave him a microphone, which the media uses to block out exterior noises?  Exactly.  It's called a unidirectional.  Whatever.  Oh, so the crowd was going crazy.  Yeah, the crowd was going crazy.  And he was trying to shout so he could be heard to the crowd.  Oh.  The microphone cut out the crowd noises so that he sounded like a lunatic on the microphone.  Why do you think they kept looping it and showing it on all the media?  Because it's Republican media. 
[00:11:30]  No, no.  The Republican-controlled media absolutely sold him down the river.  Do you think maybe it was because the Clintons wanted Hillary to...  Oh, my God.  They didn't want him to...  No.  No, listen.  I think everybody's wrong.  I think it was the most sensational thing to talk about.  I mean, look, it was fucking ridiculous.  Exactly.  I don't think there was any conspiracy.  I think if you watch that tape, it's fucking hysterical.  The guy's screaming, hey, we're going to go to Washington.  And you're like, whoa, this guy wants to be president.  He's out of his fucking mind.  At that point, it didn't matter why it happened.  Yeah, you got to run with it.  It happened.  They had to run with it.  But, yeah, that's exactly what happened.  The crowd was really into what he was saying. 
[00:12:00]  It was insane.  But you didn't get to hear the crowd.  He sounded like a maniac.  From the very beginning, the Republicans were spreading the story when Dean started out doing  well in Iowa that they couldn't wait for him to gain the nomination because they knew  they could beat him.  They spread that story.  The Democrats bought it hook, line, and sinker, which is why they so fell easily into the trap  of going to Kerry in Iowa.  There you go. 
[00:12:30]  And I do think the Republican media kind of sold him down after that.  They kept showing it because, you know, like ABC, CBS, they're all very, very conservative.  And they definitely, you know, Dan Rad, they're all very conservative.  And they did attack him and kind of throw him to the wolves like that.  Yeah, well, you know, thank God he became, he did win head of the DNC.  You trying to get rid of me?  Yes, sort of.  What are you doing?  Making sign language.  What's his sign language?  Ed.  He's our producer.  And he decides when a guest is getting a little too boring.  And that was the sign. 
[00:13:00]  What the fuck?  What the fuck usually gives Ed?  More disrespect.  We're having a good interview with Ed Astin.  I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time I'll ever be on your show.  No, that was, yeah.  I've suffered your insults enough.  I certainly wouldn't come back again.  I'll be glad to talk to you about the Columbia documentary some other time when he's not around.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  I love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Make sure that he's not in there.  He does this all the time. 
[00:13:30]  I'm a big fan.  I'm very happy to have you on the show.  He's a destroyer.  He's a destroyer.  A destroyer.  He's like Gordon Gekko.  He builds nothing.  He liquidates.  He's filthy.  He's greasy.  Yes, he is.  I don't want to smell his shorts.  He's a Svengali.  In quotes, I don't want to smell his shorts.  Ed Astin.  Bravo.  The great Ed Astin.  The great Ed Astin.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Kenny, yes?  We got Superman.  Yeah, I know.  Where's Norton going and where's Voss going?  Oh, you're getting photos and stuff? 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Thank you, Ed Astin.  Ben, like...  What is this?  Yeah, well, sit him down there.  Everyone is getting pictures with Ed Astin.  What did you do?  Dude, you went after Ed Astin.  I didn't go after him.  Oh, my God.  You so hurt him.  We were just having fun.  I think he was really upset.  I guess he didn't really get our sense of humor.  No.  The goof.  It's hard for people to get the goof, dude.  Actually, he's a legend, and I loved Mary Tomlin more growing up.  A lot of the old guys don't get the goof. 
[00:14:30]  They don't want to.  They're like, come on.  But I can't be something I'm not.  You're a destroyer.  He called you a destroyer.  Wait till Anthony hears this on the replay.  Oh, it was phenomenal.  Hey, Jimmy, get back here, man.  I started sweating.  No, come on.  Give me a handshake, please.  Fuck you, he said.  No, fuck you.  Dude, Ed Astin just said, fuck you.  Oh, that's phenomenal. 
[00:15:00]  I'll never have lunch at this time again.  I'll never have lunch at this time again.  Wait, get him on mic.  Get him on mic.  He's like cursing me out and stuff as he's walking away.  I don't know if I hate Oprah or if he's my hero.  Don't go anywhere.  More prolonged silence and awkward exits are coming up.  The worst of the worst of Opie and Anthony presents ONA's most uncomfortable interviews.  Welcome back to Opie and Anthony's most uncomfortable thing, worst of, that we're doing.  It's the most uncomfortable interviews.  Please, Eric, a little bit of professionalism. 
[00:15:30]  Most uncomfortable time of the year.  I am E-Rock Radio.  It's a song.  E-Rock Radio.  And he is not Sam.  We're both on Twitter.  So hit us up.  But anyway, we continue on in this segment, George Wendt.  Now, this one just got strange.  He was in to promote, basically, George Wendt, you all know him from Cheers.  Norm!  He never really let the Norm thing go, did he?  He was in, uh, what's that movie with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Chevy Chase?  Snowday?  No, no, no, no.  It was before that where Chevy Chase is the stepfather. 
[00:16:00]  It's a great movie.  But he was in that movie, whatever the title is.  He came in because he wrote a book about beer and drinking.  Way to get away from the Norm persona.  And so, I mean, to me, when I see that somebody's writing this book, Man of the House is the name of the movie.  Okay.  Yes!  That just came in my head.  Um, ew.  When somebody writes a book about beer, I'm thinking, this could be fun and everything, but is he an alcoholic?  Like, is there a problem here? 
[00:16:30]  Look, I loved Cheers when it was on, and I was really excited to meet Norm, but he came in.  He had gained some weight, but it wasn't, like, fat weight.  He was bloated.  His eyes.  Red-faced.  Yeah, it's like he, it was, it was from drinking.  I'll tweet out a picture, as you're listening to this, of me and George Wendt from that day.  Because you can also see on his face, I didn't even care about a picture.  I just thought it would be funny to ask him for a picture after this uncomfortable interview. 
[00:17:00]  After being browbeat.  You could just see on his face how much he doesn't want to be there.  He was dejected.  And nobody knows why this got so bad, but it just was bad.  I mean, he just, pretty much, he doesn't talk.  It was weird, and it never got better, and he didn't want to, listen for yourself.  It's Norm from Cheers on O.B.  Anthony's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  ONA's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  How are you, George?  Welcome to the O.B.  Anthony Show.  Fresh as a daisy?  Yeah, yeah.  How did the bathroom go? 
[00:17:30]  You all right?  Yeah.  You have cameras?  We have cameras in there, yeah.  Did you take a good one?  It left my scent.  Huh?  It left my scent.  You had to drop a deuce before you came in?  Yeah.  Yeah, nice.  All right, here's the thing.  I want to talk about what he dropped.  Oh, yeah.  Was it solid, or was it, you know, was it messy?  It's solid.  Solid?  Okay, that's good.  That's healthy.  I love the fact that you actually answered that question. 
[00:18:00]  Why not?  What are we going to do?  Talk about Cheers?  He doesn't want to hear about Cheers.  Let's talk about our dumps for a while.  Are you tired of hearing about Cheers?  Whatever.  You don't care?  You know, I don't have an agenda.  All right.  So, what...  Other than I need coffee.  We can get you coffee.  No, it's actually...  Oh, is it good?  The press rep is on her way.  The what?  The press rep is on her way.  Okay.  Is she bringing you coffee?  Mm-hmm.  So, you're tired of...  You got you in...  Who played Cliff?  I don't know his name.  John Ratzenberg.  John Ratzenberg sued because they were using your likenesses in these Cheers-like bars. 
[00:18:30]  What was it, in airports?  Yeah.  Were they mannequins?  Were they dummies or just voices?  They were, um...  They were like...  Audio-animatronic...  Yeah.  Like robots.  Yeah.  Do you get tired of being...  As a guy who was...  You know, like your...  Who became a very iconic character.  Do you get tired of being associated with that, like as an actor?  Well, I don't spend much energy, like, worrying about it.  So, you know, it doesn't make me tired or anything. 
[00:19:00]  But it's, you know, it's not really anything I can control.  But have you got out for things where they said, we want you for something, but they're  like, ah, no, we associate you too much with that.  Oh, yeah, I should think, yeah.  Actually, they probably don't even see me, you know, based on that, if that's what they're  thinking.  Do you like television now?  Are we on radio now, by the way?  Yes, we are.  Oh, yeah.  I just wondered.  I thought we were shooting the shit.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's...  That's actually a compliment.  That's a compliment.  That's how we do our radio show.  We don't need it all polished and nice.  George, we like that. 
[00:19:30]  To talk about your dump, a little cheer to action, and we'll get you out of here so  you can go back to bed.  George didn't know if he was actually on there.  Yeah, yeah, we are on there.  This is the way we kind of talk.  You're not a morning person, are you?  I know.  No.  Well, if you drink beer, it's tough to be a morning person.  Yeah, I was actually, you know, out with friends last night, and this really does not  fit into my schedule.  What time did you go home?  Not too bad.  I was 12.30 or so.  But I left to my own devices.  It would have been worse.  Really?  Yeah, but I, you know, I'm a professional.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  So you went to bed, you had a few?  Yeah, I did.  Okay.  So you were...  Yeah, I did.  How many is a few?  I don't...  Geez, I don't know.  You don't really keep...  You don't keep track, right?  Yeah, I don't keep track.  More than six?  Probably about six.  About six.  Maybe.  It would have been more if I had...  Didn't have a seven o'clock wake up.  Sure.  So, okay.  So you know you have to get up and do radio this morning and just promote the paperback.  That kind of sucks when you're out and you want to have a few more drinks and you got  to...  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what are you going to do?  Yeah, the book's about beer. 
[00:20:30]  The book's about beer.  Yeah.  So I was doing my research.  That's what I did.  Yeah, exactly.  Exhaustive research.  You should come in here really hungover.  It would help sell the book, I'm thinking.  So you like a...  I'm sorry.  No, go, go.  Are you a hard drinker?  I mean, I was at one point, too.  Yeah, I wouldn't call it that hard, but you know, I drink pretty much every night.  Every night?  Unless I have some reason not to.  Yeah, that would be a hard drinker.  You think so?  Yeah, man. 
[00:21:00]  I mean, sure, sure, sure.  Good.  Okay.  Yes, then yes.  It's cool to not have to get up, though.  Like, as a guy, you know, you're obviously set because, you know, here's an 11-year run  you're on.  Yeah, I wouldn't call myself set.  No?  No, look at the look he gave you.  Crazy.  Well, you have five kids?  Yeah, so, you know.  So you don't get the residual checks?  Yeah, I get the residual checks.  I mean, you get them, but I mean, they're not big checks, is what you're saying.  Yeah, they're okay.  You know, I just, I need to keep working and all that.  So you get this impression that a guy does a show, like, cheers, you're set for life. 
[00:21:30]  One of the biggest of all time.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I could be set for life if I had, like, no kids and lived in a, you  know, double wide in Idaho or something, you know, I'd be set for life.  Do you, were you, are you a guy who is really responsible and smart with money?  Like, I got to sock it away.  Are you one of those guys who's just like, enjoy it while it's here?  I just enjoyed it.  And, you know, I did sock a good bit away, but, you know, just enough for the kids, college 
[00:22:00]  and stuff.  So I thought, but no, it's not even close.  Really?  So as, as time has gone on, it's, the college has got more expensive.  Yeah.  Cost of living goes up.  Yeah.  And now you're at a point where you're like, shit.  Yeah.  I better write a book or something.  Is that really, is that, that's, see, that's a, a very, are you scared?  Of.  Meaning, like, are you at a point where you, where you're like, I'm a little worried here  about the money.  Yeah.  Well, who isn't in this, uh, economy? 
[00:22:30]  Ted Danson, probably, you know?  Well, no, you'd be surprised.  Really?  Yeah.  He, he's always complaining.  I'm like, what?  He's complaining about money?  Well, you know, he has in the past.  Yeah.  Wow.  No kidding.  Yeah, I know.  Shocking.  You should have, has Ted invited you to do his new show?  Uh, you're bored to death?  Yeah.  Uh, no, but it's not his show really.  Thanks.  Well, he's the star of the show though, right?  Yeah, Ted is.  Well, I guess he's the biggest name, but.  Biggest name on the show.  Like the lead guy or.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's the second lead to Jason Schwartzman. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Uh, Jimmy, Jimmy did his show.  I did one episode.  I just, I have.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We still have something in common.  You both did, did, uh, work with Ted Danson.  That's kind of cool, Jimmy.  He's actually very, like a nice guy.  It's kind of intimidating.  You've done lines with Ted Danson.  Yes.  That's right.  I had one line.  As George doesn't get the phone call at home, you're hanging out with Ted Danson.  That's got to be comfortable for everybody in the room.  But, no, you know what it is?  It's, it's probably that it's, it's awkward to use people from the same show and different  projects because it all of a sudden associates everybody with the own show.  But I'm interested in the fact that you leave Cheers or Cheers is done and you think, all 
[00:23:30]  right, for the rest of my life, I can just kind of cruise, do some plays, whatever, right?  Just do what I want to do.  And when does the realization hit that, like, shit, the money, there is a cap on it?  Uh, it was a couple years ago.  A couple years ago?  Yeah.  My youngest is 20 now, so.  Oh, you're getting there.  Yeah, yeah.  You're getting there.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm almost off the hook.  Almost.  So what happened?  He was going to college and, uh.  Yeah, everybody.  Yeah, all of them, you know, like.  Are you, uh, are you married?  Yes.  All right.  I was wondering if there was a divorce in there because that could hurt. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  Now that might be why Ted was.  Oh, is he, uh, is he a divorce?  Oh, is he a divorce guy?  I didn't know that.  We don't need to get into that.  Have you done, have you done another series since then or have you worked a lot or no?  Yeah, I've done a couple of, um, short live series and, uh, you know, it's, uh, tough sledding  out there, you know, uh, uh, I don't know, I don't know how to, if anyone knew how to make 
[00:24:30]  something work, they'd do it all the time.  So it's, it's kind of an alchemy thing, you know, it's kind of, you know, although Ted's  going on three things.  So Becker and then this, yeah.  Becker damages this other.  Is it depressing at all?  Um, when, when you look at, I mean, well, you, you were an actor before that, right?  You're going out, you're doing auditions and then you get cheers and it goes to what it  goes to.  And then when it's over, is it, does it become a point where it's like, eh, it's, it's not  like the star treatment anymore. 
[00:25:00]  Do you get, is there a depression that comes with that?  No.  No?  When, when, how long does it take to kind of hit home?  Like, okay, that's done now.  I have to move on to something else.  Yeah.  That's a bit of an adjustment because, you know, it was rather dizzying heights, uh, you  know, parades thrown in our honor.  It's that you feel like the Pope, you know, like thousands of people on the streets in  Boston and stuff.  And, and, and then, you know, um, so it's a bit of an adjustment, but, uh, it was very 
[00:25:30]  sort of amorphous and vague and probably took, uh, you know, over the course of five years  or something to.  And then what, what, what was it?  It must've been something like, was it something you wanted to do that you weren't able to do?  Like a role you wanted to do?  Or what was it that hit you that you're like, ugh, now I have to kind of starve a little  bit.  Um, nothing, uh, that I can think of right now that, that, uh, was a, a specific moment,  you know, but just in general, you know, you kind of don't get as many, uh, meetings 
[00:26:00]  or something like that.  The calls don't come back as fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Do you watch the show when it's on?  No.  Why would he?  No.  I mean, just like if I'm channel surfing and, and I run across it, you know, I may just sort  of stick with it until the next commercial kind of going, huh, what was that bit?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  That bit.  And, um, that's all.  Do you, but do you, when you watch it, does it feel good or does it, is there a kind of a  bitterness with it? 
[00:26:30]  It's not bitterness at all.  Uh, but, uh, you know, it's just kind of a bitterness.  It's just kind of, I guess I'm like any other American.  It's just part of the landscape.  Sure.  Sure is.  So the drinking, I want to get back to the drinking.  All right.  I like the fact that George was honest.  He said he drinks every night.  Um, see, Jimmy, uh, stopped drinking and doing drugs at 17.  18.  18.  I'm sorry.  I was 18 years old.  He knew he just couldn't, uh, do the drinking thing there, George.  I was, I was not a functional guy when I drank.  Are you, as a guy who drinks every night, is it, have you had gigs that kind of got 
[00:27:00]  messed up because of it?  Like you're supposed to have a call at six and you get there at eight or.  No, no.  I don't, uh, when I say every night, it's not, um, that's if I'm left to my own devices,  you know?  Right.  If I, if I have, uh, something.  Like, for example, when my kids were in grade school, you know, like I would only drink  on weekends because, you know, I had to like hit the deck at 6.30 or something and, you  know, feed them, get them out the door, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:27:30]  Because they don't understand hangovers, right, George?  That too.  And then the night before, I was always like, you know, now did you do homework?  And, you know, so, um, you know, I, I was a lot more responsible, but now I'm just sort  of sliding, sliding back into my, like, college days.  Where you can kind of do what you want?  Kind of, yeah, unless I have a gig.  Does it feel good or does it kind of feel like, uh, floating somewhere?  It feels fine.  I, I, frankly, I wish I was busier and then maybe I'd, you know, probably, you know, take 
[00:28:00]  care of myself a little better.  I was busier.  You mean, uh, you mean eating better or do you mean, uh, drinking less?  Just drinking less.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well.  I eat well.  Are you, are you a vomiter?  No.  You mean vomiter like.  So you're drinking?  No.  So you never throw it up?  No.  Yeah, I have, yeah.  Actually, I did it, um, when, a couple summers ago, my brother poisoned me. 
[00:28:30]  And you threw up?  Yes.  It was, it was so frat boy.  It was like, yeah.  Are you a blackout drinker?  No.  No, you remember everything?  Yeah.  You have to make the, some, I used to make the phone calls.  There's got to be some calls you make where you're like, uh, what exactly, where they  call you back and you're trying to piece together the night before, but you have to act  like, yeah, no, no, I remember that.  No, no.  No?  Uh-uh.  So you drink every night a lot, um, but it hasn't really affected you that badly.  Well, I don't know.  You know, uh, I'm obviously grossly overweight. 
[00:29:00]  You know, maybe that's, you know, could have something to do with it.  It could be an effect.  But, uh, um, no, other than that, I wouldn't say.  Does, does the weight, is it, uh, something like, for me, it's sex.  You know, I mean, eating is tough.  I think eating and sex are very similar because you can't be abstinent.  Like, you know what I mean?  You can, you can not drink, you can not do drugs, but you can't not fuck or you can't  not be sexual.  You can't not eat.  So is it, is it been something that's always been a struggle for you?  Were you like, all right, I kind of want to fix this or, I mean, how do you kind of take 
[00:29:30]  that on?  What?  The weight, yeah.  The weight?  You know, just try to, you know, exercise a lot.  And, uh, if I, if I, you know, obviously I know how to lose weight.  The hard part's keeping it off.  So, I mean, it's, it's kind of fun to lose weight, you know, cause it's all very active  and, you know, um.  When are you going to do that?  Yeah, you can do, you know, you can do it pretty easy.  Oh, oh.  It's just, uh, you know, cause it's just like maybe several weeks and it's like, you know,  people are like, oh my God, you look fabulous. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, right.  And then it's, just gets really boring.  And it kind of motivates you to lose more for, right, then you go right back to.  Yeah.  Sounds like you need beer, George.  I think that's what Jimmy's getting at.  You need beer.  No, George kind of, you seem, talking to you, you seem like a little, I know you're tired  too, cause morning radio is a bitch.  Yeah.  But you seem a little bummed.  A little bit.  Yeah, slightly bummed.  Oh, jeez.  I don't know.  But, you know, maybe if we change the subject, maybe I wouldn't be, but, uh.  Oh, okay. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  But, you know, you can talk, you talk about whatever you want.  Well, it's hard to change the subject when the book is called Drinking with George.  Yeah, I guess that's what, that's what kind of motivated me to talk about it.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  Cause it leads, uh, into the book, A Barstool Professional's Guide to Beer, Drinking with  George.  Yeah, that's kind of.  Yeah, it's fun.  Yeah, that's it.  It's a, it's a laugh a minute.  Uh, well, what can you tell us about the book there, George?  Uh, it's just a couple dozen anecdotes from my life, um, regarding beer, you know, involving 
[00:31:00]  beer in general.  And, uh, there's all sorts of, uh, tidbits, uh, you know, uh, little factoids about beer  and stuff like that.  What made you want to write a book about, obviously you like to drink, but what made you want to  write a book about beer?  They're like, you want, like, cause your life is probably interesting.  I mean, you know, again, you're a guy that already knows.  So what made you want to just tie the alcohol in with it?  Um, just kind of, uh, playing off my image from the show.  Yeah, his character was known to, you know, tip a few back. 
[00:31:30]  Do you get to a point when you're doing a show, like, where you're on for a long time,  where you start to want to change direction in the way they're portraying you?  I think they said Larry Linville from MASH, who was Frank Burns, they said that was, the  producers always said that was one mistake they made, was they never allowed him to kind  of go beyond just being idiot Frank Burns, like everybody else evolved, but he didn't  really evolve as a character.  When you're doing something for 11 years, do you get to a point where you want to, like,  yeah, I want this guy to be taken more seriously, or I want this guy to do this, or whatever  it is?  Uh, didn't, uh, didn't happen to me. 
[00:32:00]  I didn't feel that way.  It was a big group of, uh, folks.  There was, uh, you know, seven or eight of us usually, uh, you know, series regulars, and  it's only 22 minutes, so you kind of had to, uh, you know, make do with, with your little  angle of the show that week, whether it was, uh, you know, whether it was the story was  about you, or whether the B story was about you, or, uh, you know, it didn't really matter.  How about Kirstie Alley? 
[00:32:30]  You, you, you mean, obviously you know her well.  She's making a weird living now, like, it's a weird, it's, it's kind of like, it's something  that obviously hurts her, is being, the weight, and she keeps going, like, kind of, she's  pretty fat.  She is, but she's, like, trying to take it.  No one ever thought she would become a, a big girl, George.  Did you see it on set at Cheers?  No.  Yeah, she's, like, a completely different person now.  But what's interesting to me is not the fact that she's heavier, it's the way that she's,  it's almost like taking something that hurts you, and owning it, to make, to make it comfortable. 
[00:33:00]  Like, you know what I mean?  It's like, you know, I'm, for me, I'm a perv.  Yeah, I get hooked, all that shit.  So, a way of me not helping it, a way of me fucking owning it, and using it in my, you  understand what I'm saying?  That's kind of what she's, seems to have done.  Yeah, I don't know, um, yeah.  You don't, you don't talk to her anymore?  Yeah, I speak with her now and then.  Now and then?  Yeah.  She's hilarious.  But does she get tired of the whole, uh, the fat actress thing, or is she comfortable  with it?  I mean, I haven't spoken with her about these issues, you know, whether she's, she's tired 
[00:33:30]  of that, or, or, you know, tired of tabloids, and, you know, it's not really what we talk  about, but, so I can't, uh, speak for her, you know?  And she speaks so well for herself, so.  Yeah, she is.  I mean, I'm just kind of, uh, I guess from my own experience, just interested, that's  all.  Yeah.  You know, I, I, uh, I read, uh, half your book, George, and I didn't get to the end  where you have a whole chapter on rehab, I noticed.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't get there yet.  What's your thoughts on rehab?  Because there's a quote that starts the chapter, it says, 
[00:34:00]  Why is it that when you drink seven nights a week in college, you're a partier, but  after that, you're an alcoholic?  So you don't believe in rehab, right?  Well, yeah, no, I, I have lots of, uh, friends and, and family, indeed, in rehab.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, you know, uh, rehab, well, in recovery, as they say.  Recovery, sure, yeah.  And, uh, and, you know, I think it's awesome, and, uh, you know, I've thought about it as a  career move, uh, you know, because I think there's some serious networking done at those 
[00:34:30]  meetings, you know, like, uh, but, uh, I've, I've also thought about becoming a Cub fan  as a career move, um, just because all the cool guys are.  So, but have you thought about quitting?  Like, uh, I think, I'm not saying you need to, I just don't know.  Yeah, no, I've, I've quit from time to time, um, not in a comprehensive way where I've joined  the, uh, program or anything like that, but, uh, just out of discipline, you know.  Just because you can say, like, all right, I know this might be getting a little out of  hand, so I want to see if I can do it for X amount of time. 
[00:35:00]  No, not because I thought it was getting out of hand, just because, um, you know, I was  on a diet, or because, you know, I just felt like it.  What's the longest you were able to stop, or that you chose to stop?  Six weeks, maybe, a couple months, something like that.  How good did that first one feel?  That was great.  I was in Amsterdam.  I was like, I know I'm going to drink again, you know, have a beer again.  Yeah.  So, like, if I don't have a beer in Amsterdam, and then.  Well, of course.  I'm going to be, like, you know, down at the corner and just, you know, have some. 
[00:35:30]  Crap beer.  When you were, you kind of, it's kind of hard when you're portrayed as a guy on a show  who drinks, that's your thing, you know, you're the guy who's sitting there with a  beer, you're Norm.  Were you, did that kind of make you drink more, or were you, like, was that the guy you were  when you kind of came in?  Kind of was the guy when I came in.  The lifetime in the making, the preparation for the role.  And it happened to work out, and it happened to give you a great role.  Yeah.  So you write a book about drinking, and I mean, I'm obsessed over the drinking, it's just, it  is the book.  Yeah, it is the book. 
[00:36:00]  Any, because to me, we write what we know.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I've written stuff, and it's like, you kind of write with the stuff that's good about  you and the stuff that's bad about you.  So to me, like, the fact that George wrote this, and you could have written about anything,  because, again, you are who you are.  It says something.  It's like, I know you love beer, and it's fun, but to me, that's like, ah.  That's owning something that is, at times, maybe frightening.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  Kind of like the Kirstie thing?  In a way, for me, the sex, yeah.  Yeah, we're, in a way, owning stuff that is, we're somehow taking something that's bad 
[00:36:30]  and hurting me and making it work for me.  Mm-hmm.  That's just why, I guess that's why I'm talking on it.  That's great.  You can talk whatever you want.  Now, this is the soft cover, right?  Paperback, yeah.  Paperback, I mean.  So did you add anything to the paperback?  It wasn't in the original book?  I added one more thank you or something.  That was it?  The cover's softer.  Yeah.  That's it.  Good for you.  Good for you, man. 
[00:37:00]  Did you, uh...  No, why would I add two?  Well, no, that's what people do to sell more copies.  Oh, like the special version, the DVD.  You add a little to the paperback, so the people, yeah, the people that bought  the hardcover go, wow, now I need the paperback, because he added a chapter.  I've added chapters to both books and paperback, because it kind of motivated  people to go out, like, because they're like, why would I buy the same book I have?  Okay.  That's what we're saying.  You just, it kind of, yeah, all right, I'll buy it, because it's 15 bucks  instead of 25 bucks, and it's got an extra chapter on it.  Yeah, that's all I was thinking, but what, I guess...  Let me go to the phones. 
[00:37:30]  Kevin from Connecticut.  We got George Wendt in studio from Cheers Fame, of course.  Kevin, what do you got?  No!  He can't hear you, buddy.  He's got a George Wendt.  He yelled Norm, which is kind of fun.  I could hear that, actually.  Yeah, it's fun, right?  Fun for everyone.  Kevin, what do you got?  When you were on Cheers, did you actually drink beer?  Nah.  It was fake beer, non-alcoholic beer.  Couldn't drink it?  The director thought we'd cast Mike at Sluggish, according to our director.  I'm having real beer right now for you, buddy. 
[00:38:00]  Really?  All right.  Now, there was never a time that there was a real beer just for the hell of it.  Oh, yeah, towards the end of the evening, we'd convince the crop man to slip some real beers in,  because we were mostly done.  Yeah, they had their takes, and, you know, sure.  Why not enjoy a beer?  What's that, sir?  One last thing.  Nothing about beer.  Love you in Dreamscape, buddy.  Oh, yeah, Dreamscape.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Let me say hi to Greg in Jersey.  Greg? 
[00:38:30]  Hey, what's up, George?  How you doing?  Uh, good.  Hey, George, I was at the, uh, I was at Paramount VIP for the last episode.  Mm-hmm.  What time did you guys start drinking?  Because the whole cast, you guys were all shit-faced.  Uh, you talking about in Boston when the episode aired?  Correct.  We started drinking when the show aired, you know, when we got there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, and it was a two-hour show, and nobody thought to feed us, and we were just a little lit up.  Oh, a bunch of booze, no food. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Was it, is it hard?  No, sorry, sorry.  Hey, Jimmy, stop being such a freaking downer, too.  Let the guy drink.  I'm not being a downer, not letting me drink.  Yeah, right.  It's like, I, I, believe me, I relate to George in a certain way, and he's written a book about something,  so what kind of an idiot would I be if I didn't talk about the guy who's, he comes in, he goes, and this, I'm not saying,  and he's, how you doing?  I'm hungover.  All right, my book, what's it called?  Drinking with George.  All right, well, how do we not go there?  To me, that's really interesting.  Of course.  That's great.  I didn't say I was hungover.  I hadn't had coffee yet.  All right, I, I, I, you're correct. 
[00:39:30]  I did say that.  It's a big part of his life, the beer.  It is.  Do you drink anything else?  Uh, yeah, the Odd Shooters.  The Odd Shooters, sure.  Yeah.  So, what is your, I guess, what's, what's your, your favorite beer?  I have to ask you that.  Oh, that's a great question.  You know, honestly, I don't, you know, I'm a creature of whim, like, I just, like.  Let's make history today, because I know you've never, uh, said what your favorite beer is.  Let's make history today.  What's your favorite beer, if you had to say?  I swear to God, I, I can't do it. 
[00:40:00]  Hmm.  I believe him, too.  I, I, I really do.  What is, what, what, what beer sucks?  There's got to be one that you won't drink.  I, I don't really like the, uh, some of the, the new craft brews that are, like, uh, seasonal  and fruity and pumpkin-y and raspberry, you know, those sorts of types.  You always taste like fucking beer.  Yeah, yeah, I like beer.  And yellow or, you know, dark or in between, you know, I'm sort of digging the, um, craft  brews, obviously.  But, you know, I'll just grab a six-pack of anything, you know, uh, depending on, you know, 
[00:40:30]  how I feel.  I used to drink, uh, beer I found was awful, was, because I, you know, yeah, I was young,  I, I, I couldn't have no money.  So, one of them was Meister, you ever drink Meister Brown?  Meister Brown?  Yeah, it's fucking terrible, but you can get a case for it.  Oh!  But we never drank a cold.  We only drank a warm.  Okay, see, that's a problem.  You gotta, you gotta, yeah, you gotta chill it up a little bit.  Eight bucks for a case of beer.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So you could drink Meister Brown?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  That George is definitely a fucking drinker.  Anyone, anyone who says Meister Brown, that's not bad.  Sure.  It was terrible.  Really?  Oh!  When will you have your first beer today?  Yeah, what time?  Uh.  We don't have any here, we'd offer you a, yeah, I'd.  It would be kind of fun if you, he was drinking a beer while talking about his, uh, drinking  a George book.  Yeah, right, right.  Why not?  I'll have a coffee.  Well, because I, I don't drink in the daytime.  You started pretty much, you make yourself wait till.  Yeah.  That's why I hate, like, daylight savings.  No.  What the hell?  Come on, go down already. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, the shake's real bad as you wait to, wait for the sun to go down?  Yeah, I'm shaking away.  No, but have you had, do you make yourself wait?  Like, I'd like to indulge a little bit, but I'm, you know, I better wait until.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  You know, like, when the game comes on at, like, you know, six out, out west or something,  I'm kind of like, hmm.  It's like still two hours of daylight.  I don't really, you know, so it's, you're a little bit thrown off.  Right, right, right.  Does the wife give you a crap about it?  Are the kids like, yeah, come on.  No.  No, they don't care?  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  Let me say hi to Steve in Florida.  We got George Wendt in studio.  Hey, George, how you doing?  Good.  Listen, I saw you at the Great American Beer Fest in Denver, Colorado.  Tell us a little bit about that.  I know you made the appearance, I guess, to kind of sign in some autographs or whatever,  but did you get a chance to, you know, enjoy the beer, and what did you think about the  different regions and all?  It's really kind of shocking, the quality of the craft brew, you know, movement in America,  at least, I'm sure all over the world, but it just blows my mind. 
[00:42:30]  Like, everything is just ridiculously good.  What was this beer event?  Oh, Great American Beer Festival in Denver, and it's probably the, they give out awards,  and it's probably the biggest award thing for America.  For the beer itself?  For beers, various beers, various categories of beers.  Did you go out there, or did they bring you out as a celebrity?  I think I went out there by way of trying to promote my book. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  So you went out there to kind of be around a bunch of other...  Drums?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't, my book wasn't released yet, so it was kind of not the best timing in the  world, because I couldn't really sell any or sign any or how they do, you know?  How many, how long before the book came out, did you promote there?  Kind of just a few weeks before, so the timing was bad, but I'll go back, say, next year,  if possible, and, you know, be, like, selling the merch, if you will. 
[00:43:30]  Do you think television now is, what happens, you know, I find there's no, there's getting  a bunch of shit now on Family Guy because of some anti-Vietnam War joke or whatever,  but doesn't it seem like the only place we allow any type of edgy comedy anymore on TV  is in cartoons?  I mean, what do you think as a guy who was in a successful show about what's, what is  being passed off, I guess, as edgy comedy or whatever on sitcoms now? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  I don't pay much attention to a lot of shows, so I'm not a good person to answer that, but,  you know, a lot of the comedy is very soft, and if they try to be edgy, it's, yeah, it's  really more fun on the cartoons because they're just so fast.  Like, for example, Family Guy, it's just hilarious, but they say stuff and it just, it's over, it's  like, did he, whoa, what?  Yeah.  You know, and the references are so fast and funny that, you know, it's, it's like a freight 
[00:44:30]  train, you just can't, you guys want the clip that you're referencing, Jim?  Uh, yeah.  So I have it if you want.  Okay, yeah, this was on this week's, I think, South Park?  Sunday's Family Guy.  Sunday's, oh, Family Guy, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  If it ever goes.  There is actually, it's actually a very funny part in this where they have the, it's not  playing, there's two monuments, they show the Washington Monument, oh.  There it is, Washington, D.C., the seat of government for the world's former most powerful 
[00:45:00]  nation.  Wow, those are all the monuments I read about in school.  There's the Washington Monument.  The Washington Monument.  There's the Obama Monument.  It's black, much bigger.  See, because.  And there's the Vietnam War Memorial.  Hey, check out that Vietnamese guy giving a business to those Vietnam vets.  School board!  School board!  Oh, what happened to your friend?  Man, hey, I know that guy.  I killed him.  He cried like a bitch.  Holy shit.  Vietnam, undefeated!  Wow. 
[00:45:30]  Wow.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  Wow.  So, so you don't really watch most of sitcoms or anything like that?  Not really.  Um, what, I think, like, Curb Your Enthusiasm, I'll watch, and it's not judgmental or anything.  I'm judging.  I think most of it's terrible.  It's, because I think they're too afraid of being offensive, they're too afraid of getting  the letters from people.  I mean, even, you know, Sam Malone.  Like, you know, he's just a drinker who wanted to bang a bunch of chicks in a bar.  Oh, you know, he's in recovery, but he wants to bang a bunch of chicks. 
[00:46:00]  And the idea of wanting to bang a bunch of girls now in a sitcom, they'd probably go,  well, it's not really likable.  He should, you know, he should be.  Yeah, so for Charlie Sheen does that.  In real life, yeah.  Well, no, I think they should go.  Oh, come on now.  I'm hearing that George has to go.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're saying you've got to go.  The book is called...  I mean, we could talk to you all day.  It's called...  It's got to go.  Yeah.  Drinking with George, a Barstool Professional's Guide to Beer.  Have you done signings and stuff?  Yeah.  All right, are you doing any for this now on the soft cover? 
[00:46:30]  I don't think, no.  Did you want to do a promo for this?  Are they kind of like, you've got to get out and do some promo and you're like,  No, I think I wanted to do it.  I mean, I definitely wanted to do it.  What else are you doing?  Not much.  I'm just drinking beer.  A lot of theater lately.  Oh, you are doing...  Oh, I mean, I meant for the book.  Oh, for the book, yeah.  Various radio and that's about it.  Are you doing plays?  Yeah.  Do you like theater acting?  Yeah.  I think I'm terrible at it.  I've tried it.  It's fucking hard, man.  Because you have to kind of project out, but not look like you're talking unnaturally. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, and then they mic you these days, which is a bit odd.  So it's a bit of adjustment if you're not mic'd.  How much do you despise cell phones and beepers and all that shit?  It's all right.  It doesn't bother me that much.  But it's pretty funny how they go off sometimes.  He's got to go.  I really haven't hit one thing that George relates to.  I suck.  My apologies, Mr. Woods.  No, it was a fine interview, but he's a very nice guy.  They're saying he really has to go.  He's got to...  Huh?  I don't know what you're talking about, but if you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever. 
[00:47:30]  I thought I was here until 8.30.  We're waiting a word.  Unless I misheard, I was told he had to be somewhere at 8.30.  Ah, see?  See, George?  I wasn't giving you the hook.  Got to be across the street at 9.  Oh, they gave us the wrong information.  We have you at 7.45, and we have Mike Baker.  There you go.  See, you've got somebody waiting in the way.  No, no, no.  We have him at 8.15, but I think we were told that you had to leave at 8.15.  Whatever.  Peachy.  All right.  Well, what's going on? 
[00:48:00]  I do what I'm told.  I don't care.  You don't care?  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't think George is happy, and I like George.  I don't feel like he's happy, and I don't know why.  I don't want you to be upset with us.  No, I'm fine.  I thought he had to go.  That's all.  I wasn't giving you the hook.  Now I feel awkward.  No, I don't feel awkward.  I've got to pee anyway.  I mean, we talk for a half hour.  That's fine.  But, you know, Mike Baker is here, so I guess we should take a break.  All right. 
[00:48:30]  Because I'm going to take a leak.  I have the feeling you're annoyed at this.  I don't want you to be annoyed at this.  You're right, George.  All right.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  Did we go too far with the drinking, maybe?  It wasn't intentional.  It was all based on the book.  Was it good for you?  It was all based on the book, Drinking with George.  I mean, no, we weren't.  Look, I wasn't talking about that to make you uncomfortable.  It's simply something I talk about.  We do five hours a day here, so you kind of cover everything for a long period of time.  Are you sure?  You know, I've talked a lot about my own drinking, my own, I guess, demons. 
[00:49:00]  And, you know, I don't know.  It's like he's got demons.  Like any of us do.  I mean, I don't think George...  What's your demons, George?  Gosh.  I don't know.  I never thought about it.  Children.  You don't like children?  No.  I want to hug George.  I really like George Wendt.  Can you give Jimmy a hug?  Before we go, I'll hug him.  I don't know if he wants to hug him.  We're going to hug.  We're going to hug.  Like men. 
[00:49:30]  I don't mean a soft...  Like a Viking.  Yeah, like men.  Like men.  A men hug.  Yeah.  All right, well, this ended a little awkwardly.  Let's be honest.  It was an odd time for all of us.  I think George hates us now.  I don't want George to hate us, for real.  So, I want George to come back and enjoy our show.  All right.  All right, well, I do have to leak.  So, we'll take a leak.  Hold on, we're all going to break.  Yeah, that was all right, man.  I don't want George to leave while we're talking. 
[00:50:00]  Kenny?  Hi.  Kenny.  I want to take a photo with you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, are you on a commercial break now?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Thanks for coming in, sir.  Sure.  Marge, can you photograph Mr. Wett and myself?  It was a very nice day.  Should we be getting a photograph with George Wett?  The great George Wett.  That's what I say, George.  Thanks.  Thank you, George. 
[00:50:30]  Lid for my...  Thank you.  I'm going to take a leak.  My morning drug.  Okay.  Huh?  That was good.  Yeah, thanks.  Yeah, no problem, man.  Good luck with the book.  Enjoy it.  All right.  Do you all, George?  There goes George Wett.  The great George Wett.  Um...  I do have to piss.  Huh?  I do have to piss.  Speaker on the hallway. 
[00:51:00]  Eric's trying to get something signed.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Coming up, my next segment.  Oh, what's your next segment, Kenny?  Well, you'll have to sit through the commercials.  Are you excited about the next segment as you produce the show today?  Yes, sir.  It's one of those really, really weird days.  It's a great day.  It is a great day.  Yeah, it's raining in New York.  Yeah.  The only thing that would make it better is thunder and lightning.  Yeah.  What's up, Jimmy? 
[00:51:30]  He wasn't...  He's a nice guy.  He strikes me as very sad.  He strikes me as a really sad guy.  Like, I feel like we missed something with him.  He hasn't done a fucking thing since Cheers.  But I mean, like, he's...  Like, it's like...  Eh, he's on the edge of...  Dude, he's a mess.  Yeah, he is a mess.  What's wrong, Sam?  He was a nice guy.  Sam?  Uh, Mr. Wendt chose not to do liners for the show.  Oh, no?  No.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Ask him why.  Bring him back.  No, no, no.  Bring him back in. 
[00:52:00]  Bring him back in.  Bring him back in here.  Eric.  D-Rock, get him.  D-Rock.  He's not mad.  He just has no idea what all this was.  What happened.  Yeah.  Wait.  Bring him back.  Go get him.  Go get him.  Tell him we're back on the air.  But what was weird, though, is like...  I was being very honest with the guy.  Look.  I wasn't being rude to him.  Was I rude to him?  No.  He's a very talented guy.  He's not working because he's drinking too much.  And that's sort of what you were trying to get at, subtly, without being a dick. 
[00:52:30]  But I wasn't...  I was always, like, trying to get him to talk about it because, to me, that's interesting.  It's like...  I mean, I would talk about...  Oh, he rocks back.  Oh, boy.  Mm-hmm.  What happened?  Yeah, he's done.  All right.  Fuck him.  Why?  No, I asked him.  I said, we just came back.  They just finished doing live reads.  We wanted to see if you had more time.  Would you like to come back on and continue?  And he goes, no, I really have nothing more to say here. 
[00:53:00]  But he had nothing to say to begin with.  Yeah, he was great.  I wonder if he heard any of the show before.  No.  You see him?  He's a mess.  Yeah, he's...  He's tired and he's very hungover, in my opinion.  I think he's also probably hypersensitive to the...  Drinking thing?  Alcoholism thing.  No, I understand he is.  He doesn't want people to take drinking out of the context of it's a fun thing.  No, I understand that.  But he wanted us to just keep the drinking as a fun thing, which is...  I can't do that.  Like, I don't...  That's tough for Jimmy. 
[00:53:30]  Because it's not honest.  It's like, I'm honest about what I am.  And where you come from, that's almost impossible to do.  You've seen what drinking can do to you personally and the people around you.  So it's tough for Jimmy just to turn all that off and go, okay, drinking is fun.  Yay.  But you know when Ozzy's here?  He'll talk about the horror stories.  But it's never a bummy interview.  It's always a fun interview.  And yet he admits that he almost choked his wife.  Or he talks about the horrific things.  And when a guy comes in after writing a book about beer and says, I'm, like, too tired, 
[00:54:00]  you have to ask.  Sam nailed it, though.  Yeah.  His book is called Drinking with George.  It's all just fun things about drinking.  The rehab quote I read, you know, we twisted that around.  And he wanted us to just keep it all fun, like beer is fun.  I didn't think it would, yeah.  Let's party and, you know.  And we took a serious approach with that and he was not prepared.  Trying to ask him real questions.  Like, what happens when, do you feel like the money's going to run?  And I'm interested in that.  A guy's been on top for 11 years.  I don't know, man.  I apologize if I fucked up. 
[00:54:30]  I don't think you fucked up.  All right.  I mean, I think we did our best with him.  I don't think it's one for the ages, right?  Not at all.  But to me, the interesting part of that was his.  They're saying you got to go, what?  Really?  What?  Who?  No, they didn't.  What happened?  Apparently, George Wentz of Wikipedia has been updated since this interview.  And what does it say?  He's a nice guy.  He's a very nice guy.  It says, he looks like he's in rough shape, though, man. 
[00:55:00]  Ted Danson doesn't look like that.  Even Fat Christy Alley doesn't look like that.  And he mentioned the weight.  Woody Harrelson doesn't look like that.  Shelly Long doesn't look like that.  Jay Thomas doesn't look like that.  We see him every day.  George has, in my opinion, a drinking problem that's getting in the way of some things.  Because maybe it's not our place to have an intervention with a fucking sitcom legend.  I didn't want to have an intervention.  It was just like, if you're talking about it, if you write a book about it.  Again, I know what this is, because I wrote a book about it. 
[00:55:30]  About the fucking perversion.  I get it.  She's doing fat actors.  It all ties in.  We're all fucking addicts on some level.  So just, come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talk about what it's doing to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  To me, that's more interesting than, uh...  What was he talking about?  Like a workout program.  What is he talking about?  When did he...  What?  The exercises.  I said, when are you going to start?  I didn't know.  Mars, did you like that interview? 
[00:56:00]  It was a little slow.  A little slow?  Just a little slow.  To me, he didn't seem like a dick, though.  He seemed really depressed and really bummed out.  I think because we took the serious approach.  I think he really wanted to keep it fun with just beer.  Beer, fun, drink, fun.  But he wasn't in a fun vibe when he came in.  It's true.  He came in very low energy.  He came in very low energy, like a guy who had had too many beers last night.  So how do you not talk?  What are we going to...  His eyes look like he's dealing with maybe too many beers last night.  All right.  Well, if the listeners are annoyed, I'll take the hit on this one. 
[00:56:30]  No, no.  They, uh...  No, they're all right.  You did a great job.  What are we going to do?  We're not going to keep beer fun when there's another angle we could take.  Your angle was great.  I don't even mind keeping beer fun if he was in a fun mood.  What?  Some feedback made me laugh.  Somebody on a cell phone says, how does coach look?  It just made me cool.  All right, good.  Um, if he was coming, if he came in like in a kind of a jocular, upbeat mood, but hey 
[00:57:00]  guys, hey, what's up, man?  I'm just drinking.  Then you do the interview.  But when a guy comes in and he looks like he just needs to be laid down and have a fucking  and be held.  Where do you think it went wrong?  When I mentioned that Ted Danson hasn't called him yet, but Jimmy has done the show with him?  No, he was bummed before that.  The drinking got him, I think.  The moment's so awkward, you can almost hear the perspiration.  The worst of Opie and Anthony presents ONA's Most Uncomfortable Interviews continues. 
[00:57:30]  Welcome back to Opie and Anthony's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  Thank you so much, Eric.  I am Iraq.  He's primetime Sam Roberts.  We'll just call him Sam for now.  Never float your boat.  This segment features Tucker Max in studio.  Now, who the fuck is Tucker Max?  I'm thinking it.  You're thinking it.  But Sam's here to explain it.  Well, Tucker Max started this website a while back where he was blogging about some of  his crazy things that were happening in his life.  He turned it into a book, which eventually ended up turning into a very, very poorly received 
[00:58:00]  and unsuccessful movie.  But the book did alright.  What was the movie?  It was named after the book.  Whatever the name of the book was, he released a movie.  No, I forgot the name of the book.  I think it was, I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell?  Does that sound right?  Yeah, that sounds right.  I mean, the movie did nothing.  When I say nothing, I mean, this could have been the most unsuccessful movie of all time.  It's not even on Netflix.  No, it's nowhere.  And I mean, everything is on Netflix. 
[00:58:30]  This movie cannot be seen, and I wouldn't recommend it if you had the opportunity.  But!  Ian Halpern's movie did better.  Yeah, His Highness Hollywood.  But Tucker Max was in studio, and he was, this was when he was promoting the book.  He was promoting the book.  The book did well.  And he was starting to tell us some of the stories.  Midway through the interview, or actually pretty early on, we all kind of realized he's  just a liar.  Bullshit!  Like, he's just making up stories to put in a book, and that didn't sit too well with 
[00:59:00]  the Opie and Anthony show.  So, it got uncomfortable, and that's why we play it here, on Opie and Anthony's Most  Uncomfortable Interview Moments things.  This should have been worked out better title-wise.  Hit the sweeper!  O&A's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  Hey, books.  What the hell is this?  Tucker Max.  Oh.  He actually was on the New York Times bestseller list.  Ooh!  Really?  I've never heard of that list.  All right, let's get him in here, then.  Get him in here right now, somebody, before I start kicking ass. 
[00:59:30]  Excuse me.  Drunk scale.  Sucked his cock.  Blackout.  Hook up with ugly or fat girls.  Make loud.  Boisterous.  What's up, man?  Come on in, yeah.  Take a seat, my friend.  Highly entertaining.  Don't mind us.  Highly entertaining and thoroughly reprehensible.  The New York Times.  That's what they said.  Look at you.  Tucker Max.  I hope they serve beer in hell is the name of the book.  What is it about?  What's the...  It's about everything I do in my life. 
[01:00:00]  It's just about me.  I'm not good at doing anything else except writing about myself.  All right, good.  Wait, so hold on.  I can curse and stuff?  We're on a set of light?  Oh, yeah.  You fucking can.  Don't even worry about it.  Yeah.  Say curse for us.  All right, fuck.  The only thing you can't do is put profanity...  You can't...  The only regulation we have is you can't mix and match a verb with profanity.  Right.  You can say a cunt fart is fine, but cunt sniffing is unacceptable.  Ah. 
[01:00:30]  You got it?  You got it.  All right.  All right.  So what's the book about?  It's your life, basically?  It's a bunch of short stories about stuff that happened to me.  I mean, I'm just an average, you know, 20-something idiot that goes out and gets drunk and does  stupid shit, except I just write about it.  You know, that's pretty much it.  Like, I mean, you know, like one time I hooked up with this girl and we went back to her place  and she was in the bathroom.  We were done.  She was in the bathroom, you know, like peeing so she wouldn't get a UTI and I had to throw  up.  I was so drunk and I couldn't, you know, like I couldn't go in her bathroom, so I just threw  up under her bed and then, and then so she came back, you know, she came back out 
[01:01:00]  and we started hooking up again.  And then next thing I know, I'm hearing this jingling noise and I'm like, what the fuck  is that?  And so I stop.  I think it's, you know, like the bed moving or, you know, from sex and then I stop and  she's like, the noise is still going and she's like, oh, that's just my dog.  He always licks himself when, you know, when I'm having sex and then all of a sudden I'm  like, oh my God, he's not licking himself.  He's eating the vomit.  So then I'm like, you know, having sex or fucking, I guess, I'm fucking this girl and 
[01:01:30]  the dog is like, I almost couldn't stay hard.  Like I had to, I had to focus.  Normally you gotta, you know, focus to, like to, to hold it in.  I had to focus just to stay hard.  I had, I had a chick, this is true too, uh, not long ago, she was blowing me and I fucking,  like when I, when I come, you know how it is when you, like if you grab the ball and you  fucking push your hips and I, I'm a shooter.  Like I, I fucking blast.  And, uh, I fucking crammed it and I hear, and I've never actually had it happen. 
[01:02:00]  All over my fucking balls and on my bed.  She threw up?  Yeah.  Dude, did she?  It's in the book, dude.  And she's like, I'm sorry.  He's like, yeah, it's in the book, dude.  She's like, I'm sorry.  I ate a muffin before I came.  Oh my God.  I had muffin all over me.  No, the best, the best, my favorite blowjob story.  I got two favorites.  One is, uh, this girl took me, you know, like back to her place.  She was like kind of chunky, but she kind of had that look like, you know, she could suck  the fuck out of you, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, uh, so we go back to her place and, um, you know, I take off, you know, pants and we're  sitting on her sofa and she's blowing me. 
[01:02:30]  She, it was like unbelievable.  Like the type of blowjob makes your ankle sweat, you know?  And so she gets up like afterwards, I guess to go wash out her mouth or whatever.  And I stand up and, you know, put my pants on and there's a huge  skid mark on her white sofa from me.  I didn't know what to do, you know?  Cause like it was, the worst part was like, you know, like this, she comes out of the bathroom  and I'm like, oh my God.  And so I couldn't flip the sofa, like the cushion in front of her.  So, you know, so I sweep her up all romantically and carry her in the bedroom. 
[01:03:00]  I kind of had to lug her in the bedroom.  And then, you know, after I hooked up with her four or five times or whatever until one  of us passed or she passed out.  And then I went and flipped the cushion after she was asleep.  A big fucking brown skid mark.  That or the time that, one time this girl burped, like, you know, she swallowed and then burped.  Wouldn't it have been funny if when you turn the skid mark cushion over, there was another  one on the other side from some other guy?  Facing the other way. 
[01:03:30]  That would be great.  All right, let's go to Brett in Boston.  Brett, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  How's it going, bud?  Hey, so this guy, Tucker Max, I guess he's got a website, right?  I've read a bunch of his stories, but they're the ones that are just on the edge of believable.  But if they're true, he's a stud.  So, Tucker, can you tell the story about your Tucker Tries Butt Sex story?  Yeah, all right.  That's the one everyone asks for.  All right, this story, this is a true story.  You know, like I was maybe 20, 21.  I was spending a summer in Florida when I was in college. 
[01:04:00]  And I met this one girl, she's really hot, and I had never tried butt sex before, and  I really wanted to.  So, I kept trying to convince this girl, and she wouldn't do it.  She's like, no, I don't know.  So, I finally convinced her.  I'm like, look, you know, it's like she wanted to be a runway model.  That's why she was living in South Beach.  I was in Florida at the time.  And I'm like, you know, it's what all the models do, blah, blah, blah.  So, I finally convinced her by convincing her that, like, it was what, it was like the  European way to have sex.  This is like the level of intelligence of this girl.  And so, anyway, so, but she's like, you know, you have to take me to a nice dinner, and it's 
[01:04:30]  got to be like a production.  So, I take her out, and we go to some restaurant, Tantra, actually.  And I spent like 400 bucks on this girl on dinner.  And, you know, two, like, good bottles of wine and whatever.  So, she's totally ready, and we go back to my place.  And what I hadn't told her, and you've got to remember, I was like 20, I think 20 or 21  at the time, and like, I'm kind of an asshole now, but I was possibly the worst person on  earth at this point in my life.  So, what I hadn't told her was that my buddy and I decided that since this was going to  be the first time I'd had butt sex, that I wanted to videotape it, right? 
[01:05:00]  But instead of just like setting up like a camera, this is like nine years ago, so it  was before like, you know, like really cheap cameras.  We had like one of the, like the sort of shoulder ones.  Right, right, that had like the VHS, sort of like that, except the crappy version.  Right, right.  And so, my buddy hid in the closet with the camera and was going to film us.  Like, so he was hanging out at my place, and then, you know, he saw us pull up, and then  he was going to go run in the closet and hide.  And so, I was so shit-faced by the time that I got back.  At this point, I had pretty much forgotten that he was in there. 
[01:05:30]  So, we go in, we start kissing, whatever.  And then, you know, like, she's like, okay, I'm ready.  And so, I bought like, you know, one of the big industrial, like this size of like Astroglide.  Like, it's like huge.  Because I didn't know, what the fuck do I know about ass sex, you know?  And so, I'm figuring, well, you know, a little bit's good, so more is better.  So, I basically just, now here I am filming this girl, but at the same time, I'm thinking,  okay, you know, I don't want to hurt her anus.  So, I pretty much like uncap it and just stick it in her ass and just squeeze.  And I emptied like half the bottle. 
[01:06:00]  Because I'm thinking, you know, you've got to put enough in to make sure.  Because I don't know how much it takes.  What do I know, right?  And so, this is like pretty much pre-internet porn, you know?  And like, I thought you could just spit on your dick and, you know, like, no, that's  like, that's only in porn movies, right?  That's the prison way, right?  So, I fill her up with this stuff.  And then, of course, I slide right in, no problem.  And everything's going great for a while.  And, you know, and we start going harder and harder.  And she's more into it, and I'm more into it.  And like, I'm right about to come.  And, you know, I'm slamming hard, come way in and out. 
[01:06:30]  And I come out too far.  And I kind of like, you know, I come out and I like, you know, hit her butt or something.  So, I go down to put myself back in.  And all of a sudden, I feel this like warm splash on my hand.  And I'm like, what?  The lights are kind of low.  So, I look down.  And it's like kind of dark.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  And then the smell hits me.  Shit, all over my dick.  And it wasn't just like poop.  It was like watery, diarrhea fucking mix of like diarrhea and Astroglide. 
[01:07:00]  And so, like, the smell hits me.  And it was like, oh my.  And then, of course, I realized she's shit on my dick.  And then combine that with like the seafood and the two bottles of wine.  And I just, bleh.  And I blew all over her ass.  Like in her asshole.  Everywhere.  And so, bleh, I'm throwing up.  And she's like kind of hammered.  So, she's like, what are you doing?  She sees me throwing up.  She goes, oh my God, bleh.  She's just throwing up everywhere.  So, I'm seeing her throwing up.  And it's making me throw up.  I'm throwing up more. 
[01:07:30]  All of a sudden, true fucking story.  My fucking buddy falls out of the closet.  And he's like, oh my God, bleh.  Because he saw us and, you know, smelled it.  I mean, you can imagine the smell.  And, you know, it's like seafood and wine and Astroglide and shit.  And he fucking is throwing up everywhere.  So, like, there's like a three-second period where all three of us are staring at each other,  vomiting everywhere.  That video would be like.  I know.  You have no idea how upset I am.  A million-dollar video.  I don't have that.  I know.  And so, anyway, so she, like, you know, of course, freaks out.  Oh, I thought you loved me. 
[01:08:00]  I can't believe I did this.  Throws, you know, the sheet, like, puts it, wraps the shit and Astroglide stand sheet around her.  Runs out of my apartment.  Like, leaves her clothes, everything.  I still, to this day, don't know how she got home.  Like, I called her, you know, three or four times.  Are you okay?  Whatever.  She ended up changing her phone number.  Like, the girl who introduced us, like, you know, she wouldn't return her calls.  I don't know how she got home.  But, yeah, it was, uh, I didn't get my deposit back on that apartment either.  We couldn't get the smell out. 
[01:08:30]  We tried for days.  It was disgusting.  You're a good boy.  Let's go to Steve in Houston.  Steve.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, Steve.  Hey, Tucker Max.  Holy shit, you are the king shit.  Your stories are some of the funniest shit I've ever heard.  But, I had two questions, the first of which was, uh, how did that lawsuit ever come out?  Which one?  Yeah.  There's been, like, three.  With the, uh, Miss America?  Uh, Miss Vermont?  Yeah.  Uh, the story is this girl, um, I, like, hooked up with this girl for about a month. 
[01:09:00]  And, like, you know, it's no big deal.  I met her at the gym.  We ended up going to dinner, getting drunk, fucking, like, that night.  Whatever.  So, she's a slut.  No big deal.  Like, God bless her.  But, she has this website where she, um, she claims to be, like, uh, abstinent and, like,  sober.  And, like, she set herself up as, like, a role model for little girls.  So, I wrote a story, um, after, like, you know, a month of this.  I wrote a story, just the true story about our relationship.  And, I used a real name.  And, I never, ever used real names except for my own.  And, hers was the only one because I was just calling her out as being a hypocrite.  And, so, she sued me and lost. 
[01:09:30]  Um, it, she ended up, uh, we removed the case to federal court.  And, uh, they ended up withdrawing their claim because they were going to get smoked.  So, I mean, I won.  But, it was, like, it wasn't, like, a big, it was a big deal that, like, uh, you know,  the case at first because it was, like, an internet landmark, whatever, First Amendment  case.  But, I won.  It was all that matters.  Well, the other thing was, uh, I gotta say that Sushi Pants has to be my favorite story  of all of them.  Yeah, thanks.  All right, man.  Appreciate it.  All right.  Goddamn. 
[01:10:00]  Makes you put all of it in a book.  Money.  Yeah.  Fucking smart moves.  We had 26 on the Times bestseller list, right?  Uh, yeah.  I had, uh, yeah.  Two weeks on the bestseller list.  And, like, the best part was, like, there was no book reviews.  Like, you know, no one would review it because, like, oh, this is whatever.  You know, frat boy humor.  Of course.  The snobby douchebags.  Exactly.  How did you get a buzz, uh, going on this book?  My website, dude.  My website gets...  So, your website was popular before the book, I'm assuming?  Okay.  Yeah, the book is, like, half stories from the website, half new stuff. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Um, and, uh, like, uh, I get, like, a million visitors a month to my site.  I get a ton of traffic.  And so, uh, I've got, like, a bunch of fans, so...  When did you start the website?  Website started in 2002.  Yeah.  Like, uh, it was funny.  I sent, not none of these exact stories, but basically these stories, I sent them out to  publishers and magazines, like, four years ago.  And, I mean, dude, I could not have gotten turned down any harder.  If I had been a hunchback at Playboy Mansion, I would have gotten more action.  Every single person told me it was shit, so I'm like, whatever.  I put up a website, and then it, like, blew up, and then everyone was like, oh, yeah, 
[01:11:00]  we love you now.  A lot of people are just out of touch, man.  They judge the content.  You know, if it's a fucking spy novel or a war novel where people are having their heads  blown up, it's fine.  But you're dumping a load in some girl's fucking back.  You have to shoot shits on the bed and throw up.  All of a sudden, you know, people have a problem with it.  Anyone accusing you of being like a James Fry, making up stories?  I mean, like, people always, like, I don't, it's funny, like, half the people say, oh,  I don't see how this stuff could happen, and the other half are like, oh, I have way cooler  stories, you know? 
[01:11:30]  If you, I guarantee you, there's nothing in there that you guys either haven't done  or your friends have done, you know?  I was going to say, a lot of these stories sound very familiar.  I was in a fraternity, you know, but we weren't smart enough to write down our stories  back in the day.  Yeah, fucking you're out, you're getting blown all of a sudden, you're like, hey, you know,  you have a dress, I thought you were a girl.  Right, right.  You know, you would tell the story at the frat house or something, the next thing you  know, you forgot all about it, you don't have it written down for a book.  Yeah, exactly.  There's nothing in there that any, like, any guy who goes out drinking and hooking up  hasn't done.  It's just, it's just like people who don't live life, you know, to the fullest think 
[01:12:00]  it's like, oh, this guy's crazy, he got drunk.  Let's go to Eric in New York.  Eric.  Hey, Tucker Max.  What's up, man?  Yeah, I just wanted to say you're my hero, man.  You're the fucking funniest guy ever.  Next, Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  Thanks.  Oh, cut it out, you.  Thanks.  Hey, enjoy yourself.  Thank you, man.  All right, bye.  Way to start off strong on a call and then peep out miserably.  Oh, my God, that was awful.  Some of my fans.  Do you allow people to, you know, throw their stories up on the site? 
[01:12:30]  No, I have a message board where people can, like, put up their stuff, yeah, but I'm not  sharing the spotlight with anybody on the main site now.  I don't blame you, man.  All right, let's go to Jason in New Hampshire.  Jason.  Hey, what's up?  Tucker, I just wanted to know if there's ever going to be any more stories about Sling  Blade.  Yes, actually, there are.  Sling Blade is a buddy of mine who, there's a story in the book that's, like, all about  him, and he's, like, one of those guys who got dumped in high school by his girlfriend  and he's never gotten over it, so he thinks, like, all women are whores and he just goes 
[01:13:00]  crazy every time we go out drinking.  Yeah, dude, chances are, he works at a job now.  He can't really write anything or whatever, but chances are, in the next year or two, I'm going  to make him have his own site, like, start his own site and write.  All right, right on.  Sean in Alabama.  Sean.  Seany.  You there?  Yoohoo.  All right.  Yoohoo.  He's from Alabama.  Just be happy he knows how to use a phone.  He didn't know.  He's probably talking into the fucking earpiece.  Stupid hillbilly. 
[01:13:30]  Yoohoo.  I'm from Kentucky.  I can't really make fun of people from Alabama.  I really have an accent.  Any plans for a movie?  I, well, actually, I optioned a screenplay.  I don't know how you would do that.  No, I optioned a screenplay based on one of the stories in the book called The Austin  Road Trip Story.  It's just, it's a simple road trip.  Like, my buddies and I, you know, go to Austin when we were in law school, and, like, the  big, like, climax of the story was when my buddy Slingbite, who he called about, he  literally stopped up a hotel toilet.  And, like, that's, like, I didn't think it was possible, but the dude took such a dump that  it was, like, overflowing.  And I had to, you know, it's, like, after we got back from drinking, I had to shit, like, 
[01:14:00]  something terrible, so I ended up, like, going down to the lobby, and I can't find  the bathroom, because, like, the way the lobby was arranged, and I ended up shitting my pants  all over, and, like, running around the lobby, and, um, yeah, I got kicked out of it.  I got banned from Embassy Suites forever.  Yeah, I shit all over, it was awful, it was so embarrassing, I shit all over myself.  And I get back up to the hotel, up to the room, after, like, I finally found a bathroom  halfway through shitting myself.  And I get back up, and I'm covered, like, little, my whole back is covered in shit, because  I've been running around the lobby, and my buddy literally tore an ab muscle, he was 
[01:14:30]  laughing so hard at me, did he?  He's a cocksucker, right?  Of course, because it's his fault, right?  Yes, he is, right.  If you, by the way, if you do that movie, um, I want to play the big piece of shit that  clocked the toilet.  Let's go to Kent.  I've been gearing up for that role for years.  It's Kent.  Yeah, hey, what's up?  It's a role I've meant to play my whole life.  Kent, the movie guy.  Yeah, that's right, um, yeah, I gotta call this guy out.  There's no way I believe that story about the chick and the Astro Glide, and, uh, I'm 
[01:15:00]  in the Paltalk room right now, and pretty much no one else believes him either.  The what room?  Paltalk?  The Paltalk, you're on video conferencing, you know.  Yeah.  Kent.  I got, well.  That's your prerogative, Kent.  Well, I was a little suspicious when he was telling the story, because I'm wondering,  you have to have the tape.  No, dude, it was like, you remember the VHS, the big cameras where you put the VHS tape in?  He fell out, and, like, you know, like, the little tape itself broke.  Of course, like, the magnet, you know, it's magnetized, so we could have easily gone and 
[01:15:30]  changed it, but it's like, I didn't think, you know, it's like, remember you said you  don't write down your stories at 20, I didn't write this stuff down at 21, I started writing  it down at 27, you know?  And so I just didn't think about, like, oh, we should save this tape.  The tape was broke, I was like, ah, fuck it, just whatever, you know?  It didn't occur to me that, like, I was going to ever do any of this shit, you know?  If I had known I was going to become a writer, motherfucker, I would have, you know, gone  through hell and high water to save that tape.  Are you kidding?  I mean, you know how much money I've cost myself?  I could have charged 10 bucks a person.  I was in a frat.  Me and the boys would have figured out how to save that tape, let's be honest. 
[01:16:00]  We would have figured something out.  Hell yeah, man.  If somebody fucked me in the ass and threw up on me, I would want that tape saved.  I mean, um...  Uh, let's go to...  Food, all right!  Let's go to angry little fella.  Angry!  What's up, Tucker?  What's up, fellas?  Good boy.  What's up, I?  Um, Tucker, I came across your website, um, when I was...  Wipe off the screen.  LOL.  No.  Uh, yeah, anyways, I came across your website when I was looking for absent online. 
[01:16:30]  Did you tell them about driving into the donut shop yet?  Uh, no, it's, I mean, like, I can't tell the whole story.  I can't hear that.  I mean, it's, it's like, uh, 18 pages in the book.  I basically, I got shit-faced on absent, and, uh, and this girl, and I was, like, really  drunk, and this girl was, she's like, oh, I'm too drunk to drive home, you gotta drive,  and I was like, all right.  So I ended up driving her home, and then she, like, had me drop her off at her, like, apartment  building, and she's like, well, go find a parking place, and when you find it, then  come up.  And I couldn't find a parking spot, and I was fucking pissed off at her, so I ended up, like, 
[01:17:00]  parking, you know, I, I found a spot, and it was, like, uh, kind of too small, but  I was still trying to cram the car in there, and I ended up jumping the curb, and, like,  running the back of the car into a, uh, a donut shop, and, like, crashing the window  down and shit, and so then I just pulled, I got all scared, so I just pulled the car  off, and, like, parked it somewhere, and threw the keys, like, in the bushes, and then, like,  went home.  I didn't even go up to her spot.  Yeah, so, um, I mean, like, you gotta read the story.  Wait, when you condense 18 pages into, like, you know, a sentence, was there ever a police 
[01:17:30]  report?  Um, no, dude, I looked, and looked, and looked, and, uh, I never found one.  I remember one time, I was in Colorado back in, like, 96, and I was fucking horny, and,  um, yeah, Boulder, and I, there's, I'm like, fuck, I'm not getting legs, I don't know anybody  in Colorado, and I went to a Christmas party, and then I snuck back that night, and I went  downstairs, and I had my way with the little girl, and then I snuck away, and nobody ever  figured out what happened.  I just hear some, another tragedy just befell that family. 
[01:18:00]  Well, uh, let's, uh, let's go to Nathan, let's go to Nathan, let's go to Nathan and Jericho.  Hey, man.  What do you say, Nate?  Welcome aboard.  Hey, Jimmy, I love you, buddy, how you doing?  All right.  Listen, Tucker, I just wanted to thank you, because, um, it's really nice to see somebody  actually document some of the crazy stuff that goes on.  This, this stuff does happen, and, uh, I think most of the time, it's really just, it's likely 
[01:18:30]  to happen when you pay attention to a girl, and, uh, I don't think a lot of guys realize  that you're able to do a lot of this stuff.  Once you actually listen to her, she'll pretty much let you do whatever you'd like.  Yeah, I mean, whatever.  Listen to her.  That's what I always tell people.  I'm like, if you, plenty of people have stories.  They're just as funny, they're just as cool as mine, and they just don't write them  down.  I mean, like, if you think about it, it was just a crashed out window in a donut shop.  I don't think anyone would call the cops on that. 
[01:19:00]  All right, let's, uh, let's go to, uh, Kyle in Michigan.  Kyle?  Yeah.  Hey, Ken.  Hey, Ken.  The Lucky Louie star, Jim Norton.  Hi, Kyle.  Thanks for calling the program.  Get to the point.  Does Dr. Max have any good gay or funny stories?  Yeah, we do a segment called Gay or Funny, and people call in with their stories, and  then we decide if it's a gay moment or a funny moment.  Both being kind of gay, but one, the humor in it is so much that it takes the gay away. 
[01:19:30]  Like an example would be, and we've all seen this, like a guy dozes off at a party, and  a bunch of guys stand around with their hogs in his face, and you take a picture.  It's kind of gay, but it's more funny, so the funnier bride is the gay.  Yeah, kind of gay, funny.  When he wakes up and sucks them all, then it becomes hotter funny.  LOL.  You're a fucking silly goose.  Oh, cut it out.  You'll give me those ribs.  And no one calls the cops.  No one does.  I've got one.  This, uh, I didn't really realize at the time, like when I was living in South Florida,  I ended up, like, hooking up with whatever, dating this one stripper, and she was, you 
[01:20:00]  know, like tall and big fake tits, and she couldn't lubricate on her own.  And she had a pussy, but couldn't, you know, which happens to some girls, but, um, it turns  out that, uh, like one of my buddies is gay.  He thinks that it was actually a post-op transsexual.  Like in that, you know, because she had fake tits, you know, six, like about my height, and,  uh, but, you know, can't lubricate on her own.  You're a liar!  Well, that one, uh, I don't know, post-op transsexual, I think, you feel, here's what  it is, and I know I've hooked up with one, that's how I know, and it wasn't on purpose, 
[01:20:30]  but you feel the inside is like, it's not lubricating, it is, you're right, it's fucking  like a, like a, like a change purse.  And it's hard, a tranny pussy, and again, I realize it's in hindsight, uh, it's, it's  a harder, it's not, it doesn't feel natural, there's something about it.  All right, guys, punch it out.  All right, take care, man.  Be good.  You too.  Godspeed.  All right, let's say hi to Scott in Texas.  Scott!  Hey, boys, how's it going?  Hey, we're on with, uh, Tucker Max. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, Tucker, what's the name of your book?  I hope they serve beer in hell.  Okay, thanks.  That was it?  All right, you wanted to leave them with one more story there, Tucker?  Um, no.  They're all, all right, let me think.  Um, I'm trying to think of a short one.  I'm trying to think of a short one.  Um, well, all right, this one time, if we're talking about blowjobs, this one time this  girl, this was actually one of the first blowjobs I ever got.  She was, you know, we were in high school, and we were parked, like, out front of her  house, and so it was like, you know, we've got to be quiet, whatever, and she, uh, she's 
[01:21:30]  like, you know, well, don't come in my mouth, like, you know, give me a courtesy tap, so  I'm like, okay, fine.  So, uh, you know, I mean, I was, whatever, 17, I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.  Well, I guess I kind of did, but I pretended I didn't, and I blew, you know, I blew my load  in her mouth, and she got pissed and spit it in my face.  Like, she came up all mad with something in her mouth and, right, right, all in my face.  Goddamn liar!  Did she?  Wow. 
[01:22:00]  Nice.  That's sick.  Oh, wow.  All right, let's say hi to Travis the trucker.  Travis!  Yeah, man, that dude's a fucking liar.  Tell that motherfucker to get out of this studio.  He's a fucking liar.  Do you think people are jealous?  Whatever.  Do you think, like, they're jealous?  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe they, uh...  I'm a trucker.  I go all over the water, fuck with you.  You're a U.S.U.  You're twenty fucking seven to write a fucking book. 
[01:22:30]  You're a fucking dickhead, you fucking asshole.  Get the fuck out of the studio.  Kick his ass off.  He's a fucking liar.  Well, the, um...  Travis obviously feels one way.  Yeah.  Um, you have to realize...  That's one man's opinion.  A lot of people may...  Not that they have boring lives, but they're quote-unquote normal, where they have a girlfriend,  whatever, they're kind of mellow, and they're not out sticking to their dicks and everybody,  and, you know, everybody's puking and laughing.  You know, I mean, they just have more normal experiences.  Okay.  That's what happens sometimes. 
[01:23:00]  People can't appreciate that.  Let's get a positive call here.  Finding things in life.  Uh, Robin, uh, Marilyn.  It's been coming your face.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Tucker.  I just checked out your website and looked at you guys online.  You're a clown, dude.  I mean, there's no way these are real, for one.  But also, it just sounds like you're just trying to make things up.  You know, everyone has friends that go through and, you know, one-up you and make things up  when you're blatantly lying, and that's what it sounds like you're doing.  Okay.  You're right.  You got me, dude.  Are you calling him a faker?  Oh, without a question.  Uh, you got me. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, you're right.  You win.  Uh, we got to find a, uh, good phone call here.  Let's go to Mike in Indiana.  Mike?  Hey.  Hey.  This is Mike.  Hey, I was wondering, how the hell do you get all these girls to take it in the ass?  I can't get my wife to take it in the ass.  Yeah, a little tip for the guys out there.  Just ask them.  What do you mean, how do you get a girl to...  I mean, just, if you hook up with enough girls, there's more than a few of them that  like it in the ass or that are willing to try.  Just ask them.  I mean, if you're married to one and she doesn't want to, then I guess you're shit out of luck.  Get it?  Shit out of luck.  Yeah.  I guess I did the car crash again. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Let's, uh...  All right.  Talk to you later.  Thank you.  Let's go to Kevin in, uh, North Dakota.  Kevin.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, Tucker.  I was wondering, when did you lose your virginity?  Uh, 16.  Ramon!  Ramon!  Tucker takes it up the ass from a tranny.  Ramon!  You take it up the ass from a tranny?  No.  No, no.  He lifts up his balls and gets his videotaping buddies to gargle them.  Gargle, gargle, gargle, gargle. 
[01:24:30]  Jesus, dude.  Ramon!  Ramon!  A tucker match has a penis the size of an erect gorilla.  Ramon!  What?  What?  What?  Let's go to Ted from Yellowstone.  You trash.  Let's go to Darren in North Carolina.  Darren?  Yeah, man.  I'll call him out.  You can tell I'm nervous.  It's in his voice.  Look at how many times you said like.  I didn't notice that.  Oh, is that a detective? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  He got me.  Is that all a detective has to do?  Is listen for the word like?  That guy should be on CSI.  He got me, yeah?  Well, maybe he's just a little nervous.  Sometimes you're on the radio.  You may be getting a call from Oprah Winfrey.  She's going to want to see police reports and videotapes.  No, Oprah's the one he was fucking in the ass.  I wish.  Believe me, if she'd endorse me, I'd sell books.  Yeah.  No, I actually have.  I sent an email to Smoking Gun when the whole James Frey thing broke. 
[01:25:30]  And I was like, here's how you can vet a bunch of my stories.  I'm like, please, please, you know, investigate me and then post about it.  Because he sold.  Hello?  Did I hit?  Sometimes I hit the buttons.  It's on.  Check, check, check.  One.  One.  What the fuck's going on?  Go.  Fucking college radio.  Tucker.  No, Mike's got it.  Holy crap.  Okay.  Would it work?  Can we get him a wireless mic, maybe? 
[01:26:00]  We want to wrap up the interview here.  Jesus.  You got to sign this, too, bro.  Nice.  Nice.  No, sign the front.  Oh, yeah, sign the back.  Yeah, that wireless should work right there.  Tucker meets adoring fans.  Gets cock-blocked.  Yeah.  There you go, Tucker.  What happened?  There you go.  Huh?  Dude, turn the fan.  Let me see.  Let me see.  She won't take no for an answer.  I like these.  Oh.  Tucker ruptures his appendix. 
[01:26:30]  Just do that fucking...  Which one?  On the side.  It's amazing.  Where?  It's amazing.  Every time we go to that wireless mic, it works.  Is it on the fucking new ones?  Yeah.  That should be on now.  All right.  I'll throw it.  Hello?  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  Oh!  Oh!  All right.  There you go.  Go.  All right.  Go ahead, Tucker.  What was I talking about?  You were talking about...  Is it me?  No, wait.  Check, check.  Over here.  Nice, nice.  You got to talk right into it like it's...  I got to stand over.  Yeah, there you go. 
[01:27:00]  Go.  I don't even know what I was talking about.  Oh, yeah.  A wireless mic.  Go ahead.  Something about James Frey.  Oh, yeah.  I sent an email to the smoking gun asking them to call to investigate and post because  it'll sell books, but whatever.  Is that Mike working?  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Can I?  I can't.  I mean, I can't hear me.  Do you hear it through your phones?  No.  I don't know.  Because the...  The fucking problems with that.  The headphones.  I can't...  Am I hearing him just live?  I don't hear me in my...  You know what it is? 
[01:27:30]  The headphones interfere with the wireless.  Cut the shit, sonny.  We've always had the problem with the headphones interfere with the fucking wireless.  That's so weird.  Try...  That might usually work.  Pull it...  Pull out the headphone plug.  Yeah.  And see if it works.  Does it work now?  Yeah, that...  Perfect.  Perfect.  Crack of shit.  Is it working?  I can't hear you guys now.  What?  What a line.  Wait, what are you doing?  Now I'm hitting this.  Yeah, see, it's working, Jimmy.  Bomp, bomp, bomp.  There you go.  Now you're hearing me live. 
[01:28:00]  Try new headphones.  Are you hearing me live or are you hearing me through...  I hear you fine.  Through your headphones.  Yeah.  Okay.  Try new headphones.  Or...  Do you have your headphones in?  Hurry up, fan.  Yeah, take those off.  Yeah, unplug.  Your headphones are off, so...  They're plugging your other headphones.  So, uh...  Are you hearing me?  Hear the whole time?  What?  Is this on the air the whole time?  It's on Believe in the Rift.  Yeah, we're on.  Shit.  Unbelievable.  Get those headphones in, fan. 
[01:28:30]  All right, there you go.  Cool.  All right.  Did that work?  All right, so the name of the book is...  That's who worked better now.  I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell by Tucker Max, right?  Yeah.  Did Steve call in?  Steve's out there?  Well, we got a bunch of people...  The fucking phones are lit up.  Even more for them.  I know.  Phones are going crazy.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's say hi to Bill in Texas.  Bill?  Yeah, hey.  Hello, Bill.  What's up, Bill?  What's up?  Hey, I just want to say that I agree with Tucker. 
[01:29:00]  Do you?  Yeah, because a lot...  Not everything that happened to him has happened to me, but I've had a whole chill of stories  like that.  I just was...  Especially when I was in the Army.  I mean, I was quite the whore when I was in the Army.  Anyway, I just wish I'd had the hindsight to fucking write the shit down, but...  Right, right.  You know?  Yeah, so you believe in him.  Yeah, I would be a broke-ass motherfucker first of my life if I'm stupid.  All right.  But anyway...  All right.  See, there you go, Tucker.  You got your support out there.  Yeah.  I'm noticing a lot of shit things go on.  Yep.  Am I reading properly? 
[01:29:30]  Are you getting head on the toilet while you're taking a shit?  Yep.  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  Wow.  That girl was nuts.  That girl was nuts?  Why?  Well, she was like...  Jimmy, could you share your mic?  Because obviously...  Sure.  Cool.  Jimmy, look.  Wait, let me...  There.  Is that one on?  Yeah, take Jimmy's mic.  No, that girl...  Let me just...  Is this on?  Can you hear me?  Now, mine's not on.  Huh?  This is not working.  You know, if we keep having glitches like this...  Jimmy, your mic... 
[01:30:00]  Yes, Jimmy, your mic is working.  Jimmy.  Oh.  Your mic's working.  Try his mic.  No.  I want to hear about the toilet bowl.  All right.  Can you hear me or not?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Now, that girl was nuts.  She was just like...  No matter what I did...  Yeah.  It wouldn't...  I couldn't push her to her limit.  Really?  Goddamn liar!  So she just...  Everything I did, she was like, you know, you want to spank her? 
[01:30:30]  She wanted harder.  You need to shut the fuck up!  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Why would you guys do that to me?  It's very uncomfortable in here now.  I want to know...  Jesus.  But...  God, that is funny.  All right.  Let's say hi to Eric in Bethlehem.  Eric?  Pushing out.  Hi there.  I got to tell you, it's entertainment.  You know?  Yes, absolutely.  Whether he's lying or not, what's the difference?  It makes people laugh.  It's making people talk.  That's all that counts. 
[01:31:00]  Very good.  There you go.  That's a way to look at it.  Exactly.  Let's go to Don the Trucker.  Don?  Don?  Don?  Is that Don on the phone?  Don?  Don.  Don?  Don?  All right.  Don?  Don?  All right.  Thank you, Tucker.  No problem.  Thanks you guys for having me.  No problem, man.  Hope you sell a lot of books.  Where do you live?  You're in New York?  Yeah.  You're a New Yorker?  Originally?  No, no, no.  I just moved here six months ago.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  A whole new crop.  Yeah, a whole new crop of girls. 
[01:31:30]  Will there be a follow-up?  Yeah.  It's called The Assholes Finish First.  That's going to be hard to get in.  How are you going to promote that?  The book?  It'll be like, you know, A, asterisk, asterisk.  No, actually, like, you can put that shit in titles now.  Like, there's a bunch of books that have bullshit in the title.  On Bullshit.  Another Suck Night in Bullshit City.  Hey, we got, uh, they won't put it in the paper.  We got Tippi Tom.  He wants to say hi.  They didn't put me in the paper before, didn't he?  I mean, what's the difference? 
[01:32:00]  Tippi Tom, yeah.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, Tucker.  Is it true that you woke up in a bathtub full of ice with a note saying get to the hospital  straight away?  You lying motherfucker.  Missing a kidney?  I think people are a little pissed off because you don't have the videotape.  I think that's made a lot of people very uncomfortable, including everybody in this room.  Well, it gives him his fell, I mean.  Not me.  Fell in what?  I don't need no fucking tape.  Absolutely.  You're buying it? 
[01:32:30]  I think the stories are hysterical.  Yeah, if it fell, it fell.  The fucking shit.  If he's sitting on the bowl, fucking logs coming out as some girl sucking on his cock.  I don't need no tape.  I don't need no nothing.  Fuck yeah.  That's funny shit.  That's right.  Absolutely.  You don't need a police report for that one to back that up.  No, unless you bang your head against the porcelain part of the fucking toilet.  I want to ask Tucker something.  Yes.  It's fun.  Yeah, you ever fucked an ostrich?  No, that would be crazy.  That's actually a true story.  How?  Yeah.  Fuck that, boy. 
[01:33:00]  When you're on acid in a zoo and you're a rock star.  Right.  Nick in New York.  What's happened?  Nick.  Yes.  How you guys doing?  Good.  I just wanted to say Tucker Max, your fucking God.  Oh, good.  I love your book and I love all your fucking stories.  Great.  Thanks, man.  I don't know.  Oh, and I love you guys, too.  Great.  Did you have a question?  No.  I just wanted to say Tucker Max, your God.  It says, how many girls has he hooked up with?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:33:30]  That's my question.  Boy, are you an idiot.  Who fucked an ostrich?  I probably am.  Actually, I am a fucking idiot.  Don't steal that one.  No, that's ours.  What is that?  It was a keyboard tech or something from what band?  That band.  Oh, my phone's a ministry.  Ministry.  I can't hear anything.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I don't know what that is.  Yeah, don't steal that one.  That's a good one.  All right.  Thank you, Tucker Max.  Tucker, thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  I hope they serve beer in hell as the New York Times bestseller.  Man. 
[01:34:00]  How do you get on the bestseller list?  Thank you, sir.  Tucker.  Thanks.  All right.  No, dude, dude, dude.  No, I was looking at the door through the PalTalk camera because I didn't want to look. 
[01:34:30]  I didn't want to look at it live.  Why don't you go grab Mother's cell phone?  Because he saw the book fly against the window.  Tell him to call from out there.  Get him on the phone from out there before you're just out there.  Oh, is that uncomfortable?  Wait.  Should we rip it up?  A little late.  A little late.  You know what?  I mean, God bless him, but I mean, he doesn't have the videotape of one of the most amazing 
[01:35:00]  stories, if it's true.  Why would I do that?  The kid fell out.  What happened?  He fell out onto the tape.  Everybody was just puke.  I didn't hear what happened to the tape.  What happened?  Because, like, that would be something you would want.  He said something about it.  It was, you know, it was the old days where it was the big VHS tapes.  Yeah, the clunky VHS.  The guy fell out while it was vomiting.  And it broke the tape?  Yeah, and then Monty Python stole it and made a sketch out.  Really?  Did they?  But what, um, I like the subtle stuff. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, no police report, really.  Hmm.  Interesting.  What?  Did he?  Does it?  Hey, E-Rock.  Hello, sirs.  Hey, E-Rock.  We're outside here with, uh, with him.  Tucker.  Wait, what, Tucker?  Yes.  We got a bunch of people on the phone that were, like, kind of, not calling you out necessarily,  but some of them were uncomfortable.  Yeah, we want to allow you to defend yourself a little bit.  We also want to make sure we left on good terms and stuff, because you kind of looked 
[01:36:00]  a little bummed when you left.  Yeah, we don't want a James Fry situation here, so we want you to, you know, to defend  yourself.  Is everything cool?  I was just in the studio.  They want to talk to him.  He doesn't want to talk.  He said if he wants to talk, he'll come back in the studio.  Well, we can't have any of that.  For the show?  Hey, just making sure everything, you know, ends good.  Everything's cool.  There was some listeners calling about the bug.  Okay.  What happened?  Yeah, we just want to make sure everything's cool. 
[01:36:30]  What happened?  Okay, well, he told me to go fuck myself and walk in the elevator, and he's just sitting  there with the middle finger as the door shuts.  E-Rock's got balls.  E-Rock is great.  All right, E-Rock, thank you.  Beat it, stupid.  E-Rock's had a fine day with this program.  Wow.  Look.  Oh, he's pissed, huh?  Yeah, is he? 
[01:37:00]  Is he?  Look.  He's embarrassed.  We're not supposed to call him out on it?  Absolutely.  Come on.  There's a crazy story going on.  You've got your friend videotaping, and he's going to fall out of the closet, and it has  to break through the camera.  Then the VHS tape has got to be ruined, and that's the only reason you don't have a tape  in it?  Dude, I was rolling at that story.  And if you ever had a tape like that, you would never tape over it or anything.  When he said he puked on her back, I could almost go with it.  It went too far.  And then she started puking.  It's like, do you understand the type of fucking awful radio we do?  Like, come on, man.  We're not frat guys.  And then everyone started puking. 
[01:37:30]  Everybody's puking, and I got it.  The dog started puking, and the bird flew in, and it was puking.  And then my friend rolled out of the closet.  He's puking, so then I'm puking more.  And where's the tape?  And then she runs out of the room with a sheet covered in shit and puke, and wraps it around  her, and she blows off her clothes.  And he crashes a car into a donut shop, and there's no police report?  And he just throws the keys in a bush and leaves the car there?  Yeah! 
[01:38:00]  Bullshit.  That was a little bit over the top.  You should have left that stuff for the book, but if you knew who you were talking to as  far as the believability, you would have kept it to a minimum and just went what was  obvious.  It was fun at first, and then when he told that story, I felt it in the room.  Everyone was getting really uncomfortable.  Like, somebody's got to call him out on this, man.  It was funny.  I started going, did ya?  Would ya?  I was just reading Pal Talk, and all they were printing, all they were typing up was,  oh my god, bravo, Sierra. 
[01:38:30]  This guy's full of shit.  Fuck this liar.  Shenanigans!  Shenanigans!  Shenanigans!  Yeah.  They're like, uh...  You're a liar!  That was...  That really got him.  That was what really put him over the top, was the, you're a liar clips.  The mics.  And then the mics.  You shut his mic off.  I wanted him to unplug his headphones, because when he unplugged them, I was just saying,  you are so full of shit. 
[01:39:00]  He couldn't hear it.  It's so funny.  Just fucking with people.  All right, well...  Oh, wait.  What is this?  What happened?  On, uh, Jim from Philly.  What happened?  We weren't able to read any of this.  Oh.  Well, it's still up to...  It says...  Jim, what's the pad data?  What was going on there?  Jim!  Jim.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah.  What was going on in the pad data?  Uh, it just says, Tucker Max lying. 
[01:39:30]  It could have been more fucking accurate.  Good.  It was fucking awesome.  I was laughing just looking at that.  That's very funny.  Was it spelled L-I-I-N-G?  Oh, no.  That's a reference chant.  L-Y-E-N-G.  Derek said dope.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Frank in California.  Frank, what's up?  You guys are great.  That was fucking awesome.  The only thing I was waiting for Jimmy to say, hey, you dropped something on his way  out the door.  I should have got him, but I got him with Tucker. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, he got him with his name.  Like, he was walking out, right, and as he's walking away, Opie throws the book at the  window right at the moment where Jimmy said, Tucker.  So, he turned around right as his book hit the window that he was looking at.  That was great, guys.  Love you.  So, he was pretty pissed off.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to J.W. from Jersey.  J.W.  Good day, shit dick.  Hey.  Good day.  Yes, sir.  He would have been more credible if he would have went, ta-da, at the end of every one 
[01:40:30]  of those stories.  Ta-da.  Little aristocrats.  Yeah.  Sure.  Bye, Midge Me.  Goodbye, fella.  Midge Me.  I don't know who Midge Me is.  Midge Me.  One of my favorite things in which one brought a sign that said, Jimmy helped my rascal.  This is what happens when guests go wrong.  The worst of Opie and Anthony presents ONA's most uncomfortable interviews.  It's Opie and Anthony's most uncomfortable interviews. 
[01:41:00]  Talking to the mic.  My name is E-Rock, and he is primetime Sam Roberts.  We're celebrating Memorial Day with Opie and Anthony's most uncomfortable interviews.  We're going through the archives, and we're...  What are you doing, Goldust?  Shut the fuck up, Eric.  Let me host this on my own if you're not going to take this seriously.  Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of State.  You're a maniac.  Oh, speaking about segments that take things seriously.  Well, he was not in studio.  He was on the phone.  And my favorite part about this was a lot of blogs picked up what happened in this interview. 
[01:41:30]  And the number one comment was...  Huffington Post picked it up.  Yeah.  Number one comment was, what on earth is Donald Rumsfeld doing calling the Opie and Anthony  show?  Louis C.K., our Lord and Savior, was in studio that day.  And he asked Donald Trump...  Donald Trump?  I wish it was Donald Trump.  I love that guy.  Donald Rumsfeld.  It said Trump on TV.  That's where I got it from.  A simple question.  A question that will remain in infamy as long as this show does. 
[01:42:00]  I'm not going to tell you what it is.  Nope.  Because you'll hear it yourself.  But also, again, there's a video attached to this.  If you YouTube or Google Opie and Anthony, Donald Rumsfeld.  Check it out.  And it's Donald Rumsfeld, the former Secretary of State, answering a question that he wants  no part of on Opie and Anthony's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  O&A's Most Uncomfortable Interviews. 
[01:42:30]  We've got to go right to the phone.  Oh, my God.  Turn that music down.  And welcome Donald Rumsfeld to the Opie and Anthony show.  Sir?  Hello, sir.  Yes, indeed.  How are you?  Very good.  Very good.  What a pleasure to talk to you.  Donald Rumsfeld's new book, Known and Unknown, a memoir.  I've been looking through this.  Fascinating stuff.  Because, boy, you have been a part of history in this country for many years, known many presidents. 
[01:43:00]  Welcome to the show, Mr. Rumsfeld.  Well, thank you.  It's a little embarrassing to discover that I've lived one-third of the history of our country.  One-third the history.  And been involved in a lot of things that have gone on through history.  Indeed.  Important.  I want to mention that all the proceeds that I receive from the book are going to go to the troops and their families.  Oh, that's nice.  I thought what you were going to mention was you know exactly where we live, and to be nice.  Oh, we...  Opie. 
[01:43:30]  It's not...  Where are you right now?  Are you just at home?  No, I'm in New York City.  Oh, okay.  Last night I was on the Jon Stewart show.  Right.  There was a...  How did that go?  Because Jon is a little liberal, I would say.  Well, he comes at things from that direction, but he is very smart.  Very good.  And it was a good discussion.  I was pleased to be there.  Yeah.  Have you ever been interviewed where you got upset with how it went and then actually did anything to exact revenge on the person? 
[01:44:00]  Never.  Why would he do that, Louis?  That's Louis C.K.  Because, you know, if you're a man of power, it's got to be an interesting thought, at least.  Well, no.  What you do is you think to yourself, what might I have done differently?  You've got to expect people to come at you, because in our wonderful country, everyone can have their own opinion.  And goodness knows, they can have intense opinions.  But I find that if they have intense opinions that are opposite to mine, there's an awful lot of people who have intense opinions that are very much like mine. 
[01:44:30]  Now, you have been in front of a lot of the press over the years, and you've learned how to kind of deflect certain questions and handle the press.  So I guess interviews are pretty easy for you?  Well, I enjoy it.  I think it's important that people, you know, put their views out there so that we have a competition of ideas and the American people can sift through it and make their own judgments.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:45:00]  When did you first get inside?  And by inside, I mean, you know, the kind of inner circle of power in the government, especially during the Cold War.  When did you just go from a military guy into becoming kind of an enigma, kind of a person of power and on the inside?  How did that happen?  Well, you know, I don't have any idea.  I was a Navy pilot, and I knocked on doors, got a job working for a congressman in Washington. 
[01:45:30]  I'd never met a congressman.  And then I ran for Congress and served during the Kennedy and Johnson era.  And then I was in Nixon's cabinet and Ford's cabinet and worked for Reagan as a special envoy to the Middle East and then George W. Bush's cabinet.  It just kind of all happened over the decades, and suddenly I'm 78 years old.  But so how are you, like, how much, how does it feel to a, you've probably accumulated a lot of things that you know that you'll never tell anybody on the planet Earth, right? 
[01:46:00]  Well, you know, not really.  I'm interested in history.  I love to read biographies, which is one of the reasons I took four years and wrote the book and tried to discuss what it was like being inside and how the decisions are made and how complicated they are when they reach the senior levels of government.  I also created a website, Rumsfeld.com, where we've put hundreds of documents, thousands of pages, from throughout my life so that people can read them and check things in the book. 
[01:46:30]  For example, if I quote a paragraph off a memo in the book, you can go to the website and read the whole memo.  Oh, okay.  But you must have lived moments where you were like, holy cow, no one but me and these two people are ever going to know this happened.  And it had a massive impact on history.  Well, there certainly are times like that, but over time, almost everything comes out.  And there are moments when what's going on inside the White House is very sensitive and very private. 
[01:47:00]  But within any reasonable period of time, much of what goes on becomes public and the American people look at it.  Yeah.  Do you look at – how do you see your legacy based on your career with George W. Bush?  Do you see yourself as a fall guy?  Do you see yourself as somebody looked upon as evil? 
[01:47:30]  And do you think it affects what you've done before that?  Because I see you as a very patriotic guy that served his country well and still does.  But some people, based especially on your experience with George W. Bush, see you as an evil guy.  How do you accept that?  Well, you know, I know who I am.  I know what I've done.  And one of the reasons I wrote the book was to try to get out there what the arguments pro and con were so people can look at them. 
[01:48:00]  And I've taken on tough jobs.  I've had to make tough decisions.  And when you do that, you can expect people are going to disagree strongly.  It doesn't come as a great surprise to me, I suppose, having lived so many decades.  Yeah.  Were you disappointed, though, with the way your career ended with George W. Bush's administration?  No.  I think he made the right decision, and I made the right decision. 
[01:48:30]  I think once one of the houses of Congress went to the other party, the next two years would have been hearings and, you know, people would have tried to go after the Bush administration through me.  And I decided it would be better for the military, better for the Pentagon, better for the president and the administration if I left.  And the president and I were very much in agreement.  But doesn't that kind of leave you hanging out to dry, is what I'm saying, and looking bad, like you did something very wrong?  No, I don't feel that way, and I don't think history will suggest that. 
[01:49:00]  And I don't think that serious people interested in what went on who go to the website and read the book carefully will feel that way.  These are complicated issues, and we took on tough jobs.  We spent every waking moment trying to protect the American people.  And we put in place some structures that, lo and behold, almost a decade later, there's not been another successful attack on America.  Now, that's worth something. 
[01:49:30]  And I think...  I agree with you.  And the book, Known and Unknown, a memoir by Donald Rumsfeld, it's out there.  And does this kind of open up who you are as a person?  Because I think, I don't think people really know you as a person.  They see you and have seen you at press conferences and whatnot and kind of see you as, I don't know, a very mysterious guy.  And that kind of scares people.  Well, I don't feel mysterious.  I think what you see is what you get.  And I think that the book, it does open up my life, my family life, my circumstance, where I came from, from a small town in Illinois. 
[01:50:00]  I went to college on a scholarship and was a wrestler and a person who loves the country and is so grateful to have had so many opportunities to serve.  It's interesting, though, because there are people who think, I mean, here's a guy who, you know, met Eisenhower as a congressman, right?  I was running for Congress, exactly. 
[01:50:30]  And, you know, worked for Ford and Nixon and Reagan and both Bushes.  And there's still those people out there that think, you know, Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are actually lizards who, I mean, literally, there's people that think they're lizards from outer space.  Yeah, that's true.  Who eat human flesh.  I don't know if anybody's ever asked you directly, sir, but are you a lizard?  I don't think I'm a lizard.  Can you just please give that a straight answer? 
[01:51:00]  Are you a lizard person?  Louie's a little left-leaning, sir.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Let him answer, are you a lizard?  Here's the short answer.  I'm in New York City.  I walk down the street.  People walk up, shake hands, stop me.  They want an autograph.  He's a lizard.  I want to get a photograph with me.  I go to eat last night at dinner, and Joyce and I were sitting there in the little Italian restaurant, and a man came up and said he'd like to buy my dinner.  And it turns out I paid for my dinner. 
[01:51:30]  The next thing I know, the waiter comes back and said, the man insisted to pay for your dinner, and here's your canceled receipt for me.  Oh, wow.  That's very nice.  See, there's plenty of people that...  You didn't answer the question.  He's not going to dignify...  I think you're hanging around with the wrong people.  He's not going to dignify an answer to, are you a lizard, Louie?  Why not?  Because he's not a lizard.  What is the story about getting somebody paid for your dinner?  I would pay for a lizard's dinner.  I think I understood the fact that there are people out there that appreciate what he's done as a leader. 
[01:52:00]  There is plenty of evidence that this guy is a well-decorated and appreciated American, and he has more credibility than almost anybody.  Exactly.  But I just want to know if he's a lizard.  He's not a lizard.  Stop it.  I want to apologize, Mr. Rumsfeld.  Well, Louis C.K. is a stand-up comedian, and I do not share his ideology one iota.  Matter of fact, we're meeting him for the first time.  We don't even really know him.  Yes.  So we apologize.  Exactly.  It's usually just me and Anthony, but we say, what the hell?  We'll try out this local comment.  Mr. Rumsfeld, I want to ask you a little bit about the situation that's going on now in the Middle East. 
[01:52:30]  You are an envoy to the Middle East.  What do you see happening there?  What's your take on the whole situation?  Well, I think what's happening is that we had good relations with many of the governments in there, in that region,  and it was contributing to a stable situation with respect to the generally hostile attitude towards Israel,  because an important country like Egypt had a peace treaty with Israel,  and that was a valuable thing that Sadat did and Mubarak stuck with. 
[01:53:00]  The problem is that those countries did not move towards freer political systems and freer economic systems as rapidly as they should have,  and the people are looking for opportunities.  There are very large populations that are young, and they don't have jobs, and they don't see opportunities,  and they look around the world on television or Facebook or something,  and they see other countries where people are doing well, and they become dissatisfied. 
[01:53:30]  So you have these kinds of turmoil and popular revolutions.  Now, the problem is that, take Lebanon, for example.  There was a popular revolution.  Yeah, the Hamas.  Hezbollah ended up taking over, and that's a terrorist organization, and repressive.  Right.  The same thing in Iran.  Now, isn't that a worry?  Like, especially when you have a revolution, as they did in Egypt,  not a revolution, but, you know, whatever you want to call it, the guy's gone, 
[01:54:00]  without having another guy to put in there,  isn't there a worry, America, as to who's going to be there,  and what kind of government's going to be in place?  Absolutely.  Everyone ought to be concerned, not just our country, but Europe and Israel,  and the neighboring countries.  The problem is that you can have a popular protest and revolution,  and the winner is not the people that are looking for greater opportunity. 
[01:54:30]  The winner often is the most, a minority group that is very disciplined, very well-organized,  and very vicious, like Hezbollah in Lebanon, or like the Ayatollahs in Iran.  Yeah.  So you could get the Muslim Brotherhood.  Oh, that doesn't sound good.  The radical extremists.  Exactly.  Over Egypt, which would be terribly dangerous.  Absolutely.  Listen, and these are great questions, Anthony,  and they're questions that Mr. Rumsfeld is going to answer better than almost anybody in the world. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  But I still want to know if he's a lizard.  And if he is...  Stop it.  If he's tasted human flesh.  Oh, stop.  I just want to know.  Mr. Rumsfeld, again, I want to apologize for Louis C.K.  He's an extended comedian.  He's playing at the Borgata.  Go to Borgata.com.  Look, if he's a lizard who has eaten people...  Don't encourage him.  It'll just make him worse.  See, and I will stop the second I get a denial, I'll stop asking.  Tell Louis that my grandchildren are listening. 
[01:55:30]  See?  Well, listen, they have a right to know, too.  No, he's not a lizard, and he's not tasted human flesh.  But here is...  He's answering.  That's easy for you to say.  I can answer, because the guy is a great American, a great patriot.  I totally agree with that.  He's done great things for this country, and...  Yes, Anthony.  Is he a lizard?  Is Dick Cheney a lizard?  No, they're not.  They are people.  Didn't any Mexican babies have eaten any human beings?  Stop it.  Stop it. 
[01:56:00]  I know.  Mr. Roosevelt, I apologize.  Louis C.K. is...  I paid for this microphone, mister.  He's trying to be funny.  I don't understand it.  Where do you see the...  Why don't you let him answer?  Where do you see the 2012 elections going?  Do you see the Republicans taking the White House again?  And who do you see as maybe a good frontrunner for the Republicans?  You know, I don't think there is one.  I think it's one of those rare times when there's not an incumbent president running,  and there's not a vice president running, and there's not an obvious person. 
[01:56:30]  And I think what we ought to do is watch them run around the track a while and see how they handle things.  It's a tough job.  And as President Obama is finding out, it's a lot easier to campaign.  Exactly.  And so I think we ought to watch all these candidates.  There are some terrific ones running, and I think some of them have executive experience.  Some of them have a lot of legislative experience.  And see how they handle it.  Because what's going to happen is they're going to get asked tough questions.  They're going to get put in difficult positions.  And we're going to then be able to see how their brains work, how they react, how they handle things, 
[01:57:00]  what kind of people they recruit for their campaign team, how effective they are in organizing.  And all of those are attributes that are helpful for a president.  Before the Lizard Council meets and decides who to appoint.  The Lizard Council doesn't appoint a president.  And he's not part of the Lizard Council.  If they do, don't you want to know?  No.  Don't you at least want to give them a chance to say, no, I'm not a lizard?  I don't want to picture Donald Rumsfeld on the other end of this phone.  Nobody does.  Listening to you asking lizard questions. 
[01:57:30]  With red lizard eyes.  No, he's not.  Mr. Rumsfeld, again, with the 2012 elections.  I'm really disappointed.  Wouldn't it be good to, and I always wonder why this doesn't happen sooner,  to start really grooming a good candidate now?  The Republicans always seem to wait until the last minute to really kind of get together  and get a candidate there, a viable candidate that could take on a Democrat, especially an incumbent. 
[01:58:00]  Well, I think that's true of both political parties.  If you think back to the Democratic primary that Mr. Obama won,  and I think the reason for that is there's no senior council of leading Democrats  or leading Republicans who can go into a smoke-filled room and start grooming somebody.  It's the American people and the parties, the people of each party that end up picking these candidates.  But it does seem like it would be a lot more advantageous, especially for the party, 
[01:58:30]  if they would kind of work together instead of everybody trying to get their piece of the presidency,  to just work together and get a candidate, a viable candidate to run that would really have a shot at winning.  Well, and of course, a primary process can produce a mistake,  and you can end up with a candidate who's not very good.  Exactly. And I don't think we want to see that.  I definitely don't want to see another four years of Barack Obama.  No, I know.  That's for sure. 
[01:59:00]  Incumbents, you know, often get re-elected.  And I think the Republicans are going to have to be careful not to overreach  and to manage their affairs in a way that are responsible  and yet address what the American people really care about.  And my goodness, this administration has served up a number of targets.  How anyone can think that the budget President Obama put forward is responsible is beyond me.  The debt in this country is crushing, 
[01:59:30]  and it's going to damage this generation and future generations  and let people have the courage to step up and deal with it.  What was it like when you met?  There's a picture of you shaking hands with Saddam Hussein.  Like, what was that day like?  The day you met that dude.  Oh, that famous picture.  The dude who later was hung in a badly lit room.  I tried to tell Louis that that was indeed during the time when he was an ally.  I'm just curious what that day was like.  Okay.  I'm just curious.  What was that like to meet that fellow?  Fair enough.  Well, it was, I was in Baghdad at the request of President Reagan, 
[02:00:00]  and I kind of described this in my book.  I met the night before with Tariq Asis, the deputy prime minister,  and then the next morning I was invited in to be with Saddam Hussein.  And the reason that Secretary Shultz and President Reagan and I all agreed that it made sense was  Saddam Hussein was in a war with Iran and had taken our embassy people hostage  and was very hostile to the United States.  The United States did not have diplomatic relations with Iraq, 
[02:00:30]  and the thought was that, you know, the old adage,  the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Right.  How did we manage to get crossways with the two big countries in that region, both of them?  And yet they were hostile to each other.  Right.  So we felt that it was a good idea to see if we could reestablish relations,  and that ultimately was done shortly after my visit.  Now, what was it like?  You walk in, there's a Middle Eastern despot.  Is he a good guy or a Democrat? 
[02:01:00]  No.  He's a thug.  And he's in it fatigues, and he's got a pistol on his hip.  And he's a tough guy and not a good guy.  On the other hand, people in Iran were worse.  And when you get up in the morning and look around the world,  you know, there are not a lot of George Washingtons or Abraham Lincolns.  We have to deal with people who aren't perfect on occasion.  Exactly.  That's what I was trying to tell Louie.  So how many guys do you think you've met that died by hanging?  Oh, Jesus.  That's a good question. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, more than one.  More than one.  More than one.  I've never met anybody who...  I met a girl who hung herself.  He's had...  I've never met anybody who was sentenced to hang.  He's had to deal with thugs during his career at some point.  He's, you know, the world...  And a lot of people judge things, I've noticed, Mr. Rumsfeld,  a lot of people judge things based on what's going on now.  They don't take it in the context of the history and what was going on at the time.  Now, during the Cold War, I think we were willing, as Americans and the press, 
[02:02:00]  to accept a lot more covert action on the part of the government for our own safety than we are now.  Do you think that's a better thing, that there's so much more information available now?  Or is it kind of a good thing for the government to have maybe a little bit of...  a little more covertness in their actions?  Oh, I think you're right.  I think that we live in a world where there are relatively few countries that are like we are.  We have free political systems. 
[02:02:30]  And that means that we have got to have intelligence-gathering activities  if we're going to protect the American people.  Exactly.  But what, like, hey, American safety is, like, the biggest deal to us.  American defense.  We've got to keep the American people safe.  But how many...  But what if a whole lot of people in other places have to die in order for us to be safe?  Like, what if you found out that a lot of America was going to get hurt  unless we just took France and just wiped it out?  Would you trade France... 
[02:03:00]  Hypothetical.  Would you trade France for Texas and Arizona?  Can you imagine if I answered that question?  Thank you.  Thank you.  But the new plead would be...  Exactly.  It would be like answering your earlier question,  where I would deny that I'm something that you asked me.  Right.  He's not going to deny he's a lizard.  But he hasn't officially denied it.  What would be hurt by denying that you're a lizard?  I did not just arrive in town falling off a turnip. 
[02:03:30]  There are no turnip carts in New York City.  Well, he didn't fall off of one.  No, I totally understand.  But no, that's fascinating to me.  What would be hurt by...  And I'm not going to ask you to deny it now.  I'm more interested in what would be hurt if you denied that you're a lizard.  It's justifying the question.  Sorry, I brought it up.  I apologize.  No.  But, I mean, we like to think that we're a comedy show,  so we're just kind of asking a silly question there, Mr. Rumsfeld.  But that is fascinating to me,  that saying I am not a lizard might be dangerous. 
[02:04:00]  I want to know how it might hurt...  How would it hurt your credibility?  How did this happen?  How did this happen?  There's a guy laughing in the background  that is looking up our addresses now.  Mr. Rumsfeld, notice that Anthony Cumia is...  A true patriot.  I am right behind you.  I love your book.  Donald Rumsfeld, known and unknown memoir in bookstores now.  This thing really flying off the shelves, too.  I want to ask Mr. Rumsfeld his opinion on the unions right now. 
[02:04:30]  That's a big topic right out there.  Well, it is, and what we've got is a government and administration  that, according to the data,  has fewer people who've ever been in business  than any administration in modern history.  And what you've got is a lot of people who are lawyers  and professional government people,  and they don't have the business background.  They have very close connections to the unions,  and I'm terribly worried about the way that our trade relations  are going around the country. 
[02:05:00]  We are...  The president and the administration have been responding  to pressure from the unions  with respect to the trade deal with South Korea,  the trade agreement with Colombia.  Here's Colombia, an important country in our hemisphere,  and we've been stiffing them.  And not...  We're missing what's going on in the world.  In Asia, there are all kinds of trade agreements,  and the United States is absent without leave.  We're not engaged in doing it.  And I think the answer is it's because of the unions.  And we're at a first point in our country 
[02:05:30]  that there are who are in the private sector.  That's a conflict, if you ask me.  Well, it's a worry.  Yeah.  And I think it's also not surprising, then,  to note that the average pay of government employees  is now higher than in the private sector.  That's not right.  And of course...  That is not right.  Why is that not right?  Because it should be the other way around.  Well, of course, we're...  Teachers are government employees, right?  And the jobs and the products and the opportunities 
[02:06:00]  are all in the private sector, not in government.  Right.  But a teacher is a public employee, right?  Is a unionized public employee.  Yes.  So they should be paid well, right?  But it's not a matter of being paid well.  But they should have the power to get together  and bargain for better pay and better benefits, right?  Well, if you look around at the school systems,  they are in trouble.  And they're not providing the kind of education for kids.  And so the system isn't working perfectly. 
[02:06:30]  My wife, Joyce, started the Chicago Foundation for Education  because the Chicago school system was described  as the worst school system in America some years, 25 years ago.  Wow.  And that's...  Here's a great city, a wonderful city.  And it had a school system that the Secretary of Education  labeled the worst.  Now, why is that?  It isn't because people are bad.  It's because the process isn't working.  There wasn't any choice.  People didn't have a choice. 
[02:07:00]  They paid their taxes, and they had to go to school  in their neighborhood, and they didn't have choice.  I'm a Milton Friedman fan.  I think giving school vouchers so that people can...  Parents and kids can make those choices.  And pretty soon, the schools that nobody wants to choose  have to disappear.  And the schools where people want to go  succeed because they get a good education,  they prosper.  Yeah, but American public schools used to be great,  and now they're not.  So for years and years, they did well without vouchers  and charter schools, and then all of a sudden, 
[02:07:30]  money got taken out of those systems,  and now they're suffering.  And then the people that took the money out  pointed at the system and go,  ha-ha, you suck, because I took your money away.  So now we're going to...  So what happened?  Why did they work before?  I don't think that's the case.  What you just said,  I don't think that the reason the schools  are not doing well today  is because the money's not there.  I think that you look at the average price  that we're paying per student or per school,  and it's quite high.  It just isn't producing the kind of results  that a more competitive system would. 
[02:08:00]  How come it worked before, though?  When it was simpler,  most people went to public schools,  and you could just walk down to your public school  and get a great education.  How come there's a decline  when it was working without the competition?  I think probably it was a result of the fact  that we were more of a rural country.  We had much more parental involvement.  There was more smaller elements.  And then as we became more of an urbanized country, 
[02:08:30]  there was more distance between parents in the schools,  more distance between government in the schools,  and they just deteriorated.  And teaching the basics of what people need to know  instead of a lot of political correct gibberish  that are in the schools now.  That's what hurts the schools.  I believe that, Louie.  Is teaching evolution that's what hurts the schools?  No, no, no, I'm not saying that.  I just think that there's a lot going on in schools  that has nothing to do with educating the students  and preparing them for life. 
[02:09:00]  I could be wrong,  but I think there might have been one other thing.  You know, for years we had the draft,  and we excluded people from the draft  who were students, teachers, or married.  And as a result,  people who did not want to serve in the military  kind of gravitated to getting married  or becoming a teacher or becoming a student.  And so over time you had a bifurcation of a generation.  And that group is now just about retiring. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  The all-volunteer military came in  under the Nixon administration  in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  And so all of those people that were up to 1970  now, of course, would be 30, 40 years later.  So if they became teachers in the ages of 20, 25, 30,  they'd now be retiring.  Did he answer the question about unions?  Are you for or against the unions, sir? 
[02:10:00]  What do you mean?  I've got no problem with unions.  What I have a problem with is  if unions end up exerting an undue influence  in what's taking place in our country  and stopping the United States of America  from participating in free trade agreements  around the world,  which are the kinds of things  that help to create jobs.  Yeah, that's not a good thing.  But if the jobs are in other places and what...  I mean, if the United States is getting to compete,  who is the United States at that point?  Is it General Electric and, you know, Walmart? 
[02:10:30]  Or is it actual people who live in these places  like Wisconsin who are asking to be able  to sue for their own rights as a union?  Well, you know, I think that the governor up there,  I'm not knowledgeable about Wisconsin.  I'm from New Mexico,  as the cover of my book shows.  No, you've got a polar fleece on.  A handsome picture.  But my recollection is that the governor ran on a platform  of doing exactly what he's doing,  addressing the fact that the state is bankrupt. 
[02:11:00]  And how does he fix that?  Well, he can't fix it if the unions won't let him.  And he's going to have to find a way  to put that state on an upward path  rather than allowing it continue to go down,  spending more than they take in.  Exactly.  And if the unions are going to try to prevent that,  he has to do something about that.  I got an observation.  You sound just like Dr. Demento.  What?  Dr. Demento.  Someone's going to appreciate that out there.  Why is somebody...  The Funny Five.  The guy used to do the funny radio thing. 
[02:11:30]  Yes.  You've got the exact same voice.  Well, he's got a very distinctive voice.  I know you could always tell Donald Rumsfeld  when he was on TV,  even from the other room,  you have a very strong, distinct voice.  I have a couple of questions.  Just out of curiosity, I want to ask you.  It's just an observation.  Mr. Rumsfeld,  what type of aircraft did you fly?  I was flying...  The last plane I flew was an S-2F,  which was a Grumman anti-submarine plane.  Oh, that's cool.  Did you have more capability to fly it  because of your lizard reflexes? 
[02:12:00]  Stop it!  I've got a thought for you.  Okay, good.  Folks are looking for a present for friends of yours.  I spent eight days recording  the unabridged version of my book.  Oh.  About eight hours a day.  And if you want to hear the voice...  And the voice, right.  What you do is you buy the unabridged version of the book,  and then you can play it in your car  when you're going to and from work,  and I'll be right there with you.  I think you need that, Louie. 
[02:12:30]  I'll be right there with you.  You absolutely do.  I want to ask you one more thing  because I know you've got to go soon.  I'm a very, very strong advocate of the Second Amendment.  I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.  Are you a member of the NRA?  I'm not sure if I am right now.  I have been, and I think I am.  And are you an avid shooter?  Because I am, and I love it.  I have guns.  I have rifles and shotguns and pistols  at various locations,  and I'm an elk hunter out in New Mexico. 
[02:13:00]  So you're a strong advocate of the Second Amendment,  as I am, sir?  Have you ever shot a person?  No.  No.  That's a great question.  I think everybody should be asked that.  No, I have.  Have you shot a person?  He was the Secretary of Defense.  He was in charge of everybody that America killed  for a very long time.  Oh, stop it.  I've been shot at.  Does that count?  He's been shot at.  That's crazy.  I was next to President Ford  when the bullet went right by his head  and right by my head  into the hotel in San Francisco.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  That was that crazy.  Were you ever shot at with any other,  besides bullets,  like plasma rays or anything else  that are used?  Space to take down.  Would you stop it, Louie?  My God.  Flesh-eating space lizards.  My God, man.  We eat the poor.  Donald Rumsfeld,  Known and Unknown,  a memoir.  I suggest anybody that's interested  in the history of this fine country  and the history of a patriot  and this fine man,  go out and buy this book.  Thank you, Donald Rumsfeld.  Thank you so much.  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Enjoy being with you.  I'm pretty sure you're a lizard.  Thanks, sir.  He's not a lizard.  Stop it.  Thank you, sir.  He ate people once.  You should select your partners carefully.  Yeah, I'm trying.  I'm trying.  This is a local comic, sir,  that we really don't know much about.  Yeah, I don't know him.  He'll be gone tomorrow.  Thank you, sir.  Donald Rumsfeld, everyone.  There he is.  Donald Rumsfeld.  It's Memorial Day,  and our tribute to fallen guests continues.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony presents  ONA's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  The show, Opie and Anthony.  The special, uncomfortable interviews.  The hosts, E-Rock and Sam. 
[02:14:30]  We were going to go with Sam and E-Rock,  but go ahead.  It sounds better that way.  As Sam and E-Rock.  So we're playing uncomfortable interviews  from the archives of the Opie and Anthony program.  Not just uncomfortable interviews.  The most uncomfortable interviews.  Well, there was a lot of them,  but we can only play a certain amount for this special.  Opie and Anthony's interview prowess  is best uncomfortable.  That's where they're at on their A-game.  And sometimes it's not even them doing it.  Sometimes it's the guest's fault.  Well, you remember the subway vigilante, 
[02:15:00]  Bernie Getz?  Bernie Getz.  If you don't know who he is,  Wikipedia, because we don't have time.  For a minute, he was like a regular on our show.  He was like a Bobo type.  Yeah.  Like this guy, this crazy guy,  he would come on the show  until one day  when Opie did something  that rubbed him the wrong way.  And let's just say  this interview  is one of the very few times  when Opie and Anthony have proven  that they need a security guard on premises.  There is actual video 
[02:15:30]  of this incident.  If you Google or go on YouTube  and you type in  Opie and Anthony and Bernie Getz,  you'll find it.  Facebook slash Primetime Sam Roberts.  No.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Club Soda Kenny.  Stop it with him.  He wants...  I forgot to plug him.  It's Bernie Getz,  the subway vigilante,  not the guy you want to mess with.  Here's why.  I know Opie and Anthony's  Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  ONA's Most Uncomfortable Interviews. 
[02:16:00]  Bernie loves the weekly world news.  Yeah.  Hey, can you believe this?  There's an article,  this is a new revelation about history  that the Vikings were sissies.  Actually sissies.  The Vikings were sissies?  And they used that word sissies?  Wow, I don't know if I believe that.  Did you see that one weekly world news  where the headline was  Bernie Gets to the Point?  Well, this is the news.  This is the news I see.  There's a bunch of pictures  of dead animals and stuff.  I can't understand what that is.  That's just for shock value.  There's a crossword puzzle. 
[02:16:30]  I wouldn't even know how to do that.  And then other, let's see,  nonsense, some personal ads.  Six-letter word for Target starts with N.  Here's something everyone here could learn.  Strip club adequate.  Ten essential do's and don'ts.  Okay?  Okay?  Wait, wait.  What was that?  I missed that.  Oh, look.  And there's another...  Oh, so what?  And look, here's another article.  The Republicans now,  they're fighting for  Caucasian History Month. 
[02:17:00]  And they show a picture  of Donald Trump shouting  with Ronald Reagan  standing in the background.  I bet you'd be honored  during that month.  They won Caucasian History Month.  I would honor you during that month.  Wait, what's that name?  Where's that other thing?  I want to hear...  What month is he on the Klan calendar?  This is a new one.  Just hit the newsstands.  They have him shirtless for July.  Strip club...  Wait, was that strip club?  What was the name of that?  Oh, look.  Here's other stuff.  History.  Jesus drove his brother to drink.  It's possible.  Adequate. 
[02:17:30]  Get Craig Christ ready.  That's how we'll end this.  Craig Christ from Stephen Lynch.  This is about vegetarian.  They're showing giant pictures  of mutant vegetables.  Mutant vegetables.  This is horrible.  Anyway, I'm going to take this home  and read it.  Hold on.  Can you go back to the stripper etiquette?  We'll end with stripper etiquette.  Oh, what is there?  You know, you just do nothing.  You know, buy drinks.  Put money in their belt  and say nothing.  It's usually the best thing.  Right.  Just look.  Look and enjoy.  Bernie, would you like to go  to a strip club with us?  Nah.  No?  No, why not?  We'll take you out. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, thanks.  That'd be fun.  Nah.  Nah?  Nah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Nah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Better porno on the internet.  Gotta get bullets.  That's the news.  And no news is good news.  You're safe from the horrible storm.  Definitely easier to shoot a gun  than drive a car.  Yeah.  Laugh at me.  I'll get out of here.  I'm a good shooter.  I'm a good shooter.  Definitely a good shooter.  Definitely a good shooter.  Yeah.  And I want my CD back.  What CD?  That one CD.  You played one CD of that nice music in the beginning. 
[02:18:30]  Of course, Wapner comes on it.  That was the arm.  Yeah.  Remember that arm you played one music of that?  You played about a minute and a half of that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Goddamn, Bernie.  I love when you come on.  Yeah.  The best I love when you come on.  The first 40 minutes were quite boring, but, man, you made up for it.  What are you kidding?  You made up for it for the last 10 minutes.  Well, I didn't mean to.  I thought it was the worst.  What did we learn, Anthony?  That Jesus Christ drove his own brother to drink.  That fat chicks make sexy faces sometimes. 
[02:19:00]  Should we first have adequate?  Adequate.  It's easier to shoot a pistol than to drive a car with one hand.  Asma Bin Laden.  Oh, Bernie, what are you doing?  Of Asma.  It's right here.  It's right here.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  No, no, no.  You got to go out of the machine.  Yeah, sit down, Bernie.  It's in a thing.  It's right there.  Oh, yeah, sit down.  I'll get it to you.  We're going to say goodbye to you.  Wow.  You rule, Bernie.  No.  No.  No.  This one, right?  It says arm on the front.  Oh.  What are you? 
[02:19:30]  Motherfucker.  Tony.  Both of you are asking for trouble.  Tony.  Oh, he's coming over.  Oh, Bernie, Bernie, sit down.  Sit down.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  He's really mad.  He's really mad.  You pissed off Bernie.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right, sit down.  Stand up to your right, Bernie.  Sit down, Bernie. 
[02:20:00]  Sit down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay, Poe.  Poe, it's okay.  It's okay.  Poe, it's okay.  Poe, it's okay.  Poe, it's okay.  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh.  I'm ready to get that fucking CD.  Oh, yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you got to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie.  He's fine, Poe.  You tell him to relax.  Poe, he's fine.  You tell him to relax. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  I mean.  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep your CD.  I won't be here again.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie's leaving.  Oh, man.  Do you got his CD?  Give him his CD.  Oh, you ruined it.  Bring him back in.  Give him his CD.  No, we'll explain what happened.  We'll explain what happened.  Bring him back in.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Oh, he's going into his bag.  Holy shit.  He's going into his bag.  No, he's at Bernie.  It's okay.  Bernie, we got the CD.  We got the CD. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, he's pissed.  Oh, my God.  Wait, follow him out with the cell phone.  Make sure he knows we never, it was a fake CD.  No, follow him out with the cell phone.  Opie took a fake, it wasn't his CD, and started smashing it.  No, of course not.  And he lost his mind.  Of course not.  Did you get him with the CD?  Lord, I think we saw some of that rage.  Yeah.  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it.  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV where the guy finally snaps on the stand.  Finally cracks him.  The lawyer cracks him.  All right, I did it.  See?  All right, hold on.  I think...  And I'm not sorry. 
[02:21:30]  I'd do it again.  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Jesus.  Bernie, this is your CD right there.  Okay, thank you.  That's not the one he...  Relax.  That's not the one.  That's yours.  Tell him...  Listening back.  That's the one he used in the studio.  Eric, explain.  Explain what we do.  Bernie, the joke.  He had another CD.  Take a look at it.  It's not even broken or damaged.  Anyway, it's okay.  Watch your life.  Watch your life.  No, no, no.  I want to go...  It's 9 o'clock. 
[02:22:00]  They want to go home anyway.  They still want to talk to you.  Go back inside and at least let's not burn bridges.  Let's go back.  Come back in and talk.  He's coming in.  All right.  Wait, that sounds scary.  Hold on.  He's coming in.  They just want to talk to you.  I hope he's building a barrier.  All right, Bernie.  I'm waiting for you.  Sit down, sit down.  No, it's 9 o'clock.  Bernie, let me explain what happened, though, Bernie.  Let me explain what happened.  Wait, put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  Yeah.  Because I don't explain.  Because we really like you.  We want you to be a friend of the show.  I love Bernie Getz, and I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here. 
[02:22:30]  Bernie, we felt like...  Here.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  We felt like you were a friend of the show that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Here's the...  Wait, here.  I'm going to show you.  Calm down.  Here's the CD I was smashing.  Okay, I didn't know that.  Okay.  The CD I was smashing was called Haunted Pussy.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  It had nothing to do with the one that...  You were smashing Haunted Pussy.  You're smashing that time.  Bernie, I never touched your CD.  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in, and made the old switcheroo. 
[02:23:00]  Bernie, we still pals?  Things are okay.  Things are okay.  I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  A friend of mine.  I consider...  Okay, or just...  Or whatever.  Bernie, look at your CD.  He doesn't like the Bernie label.  It's okay.  Look at your CD.  There's not a scratch on it.  I didn't smash you.  I trust you.  All right?  Sure enough to look at it.  I thought we were at that stage in our friendship that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all.  Why didn't you smash your CD, though?  It's like...  I mean, it wasn't as bad as what if someone took your kid and said,  I'm hanging your kid out the window like Michael Jackson. 
[02:23:30]  Well, there you go.  That's bad.  I know.  It's not that bad.  It's only a CD.  There you go.  All right, Bernie.  So we're cool.  We're cool.  And anyway, that's the news for the week.  Thank you, Bernie.  Very good.  Bernie gets everybody.  Now that everybody knows what's happening in the world, you know?  I hear you.  And it's...  All right.  It's up on...  Phew!  Yeah, that was cool.  We're cool in the gang.  That was intense.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You guys are...  Now I know what those guys felt on that subway.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh, boy.  Just all night and day.  The way he could turn it on?  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  He really turned it on.  Oh, what a quick fuse.  What?  That's not a slow burn.  You taking the subway home?  Everything's cool, Bernie.  Everything's open.  Shut the fuck up!  We're going to be like little Fonzies.  And what's Fonzie, Bernie?  I don't know.  Cool.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  That's okay.  All right.  Bernie, we didn't want you...  It's going to be a mild winter.  We didn't want you going away mad.  All right.  Is that yours?  Oh, you dropped something, Bernie?  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  Now let's take the same ski jacket he was probably wearing back in the back. 
[02:24:30]  Okay, guys.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Bernie.  Thank you.  Bernie, guys.  Bernie, is this yours?  Bernie, is this yours?  Holy S.  No, no.  Eric, it's...  Yeah.  Did I get him?  Yes, you did.  He was coming back in.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  Dude, that was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  We saw it. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Eric was in between me and Bernie, and I got to give Eric a lot of credit, man.  He was holding him back.  He was out of his mind.  Hey, you know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man, and when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was  kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go, it's not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport, he just like, ah, just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster, and a little smoke billowed up, and he couldn't  handle it. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  Imagine that, though.  No, but you didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just walked.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You bastard.  Have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Look at me.  I'm still shaking.  I am shaking.  Dude, you had a pissed Bernie Gats right here in your face. 
[02:26:00]  Oh.  And there's no reasoning with him when he's that mad.  You can't reason with him.  No.  No.  He just walked out.  Yeah.  He was convinced you smashed that CD of his.  That was one of his things.  You see how he was looking for it before you made Like He Smashed It?  He came over to Opie's area, looked through those CDs that Opie's got in front of him,  going, there was a CD.  I have it.  Because he needs to know where everything is.  Yeah.  Very particular.  Yeah.  Or there's something wrong with him in the world.  Yeah.  And then he sat back down. 
[02:26:30]  You told him that the CD you had in your hand was the CD in question.  When you started smashing it, the look on his face, that's when he snapped.  Keep your fucking CD.  Rawr.  Wow.  Eric, is he all right?  He's gone.  Eric, you, I have to tell you, you rock.  No problem.  Eric got in between me and Bernie.  Bernie was literally like, what?  He kept kneeing me in the legs.  I'm like, stop.  He's like, give me my CD, my CD.  And I'm sitting here with this hand trying to cover his real CD so he doesn't see it. 
[02:27:00]  And Opie's just sitting there going, oh my God.  He's going to hit me.  Could you imagine if he's got to go on the subway right now?  Oh.  Some black guy is in his seat or something?  Oh, forget it.  With an iPod?  With just disrespecting CDs?  All right.  Bernie, what's the matter?  Hot water burn baby.  Hot water burn baby.  Fucking psychopath.  Why don't we take a break?  We have Billy Burr in studio.  And that's the news for today.  Keep your fucking CD.  I pushed the CD in the case.  It does this when it's told. 
[02:27:30]  It does this when it's told.  You want your CD, Bernie?  Would you?  Wait a minute.  Would she be a great big black person?  We're going to do that.  A CD.  Was that track 14?  Wow.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Billy Burr in studio, like I said.  Fine.  Keep your fucking CD.  But first, you know, Bernie Goetz was talking about how Jesus Christ, you know, drove his own  brother to drink.  He was.  I forgot everything that happened before that snap. 
[02:28:00]  It's just a segue.  Just a segue.  Huh?  The heart rate's still up.  I know.  That was really, like, exciting.  Poe came in here with the...  He was the second most crazy person in this room.  That look in his eyes.  And he went to grab Bernie, and Bernie was, like, pissed.  Everyone was just out of their minds.  Poe was in the other room calming down, doing his little...  Oh, doing his calm down procedure.  Did they get video of that?  Yeah, we have it all.  Danny was in here the whole time?  Yep, you stayed right there with the camera. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, nice.  Get Danny in here.  I got to see how the video looks.  Did Poe make a wrong turn and go into the production studio first before he came in here?  I don't know what happened.  But did he know the directions to get here, to this studio?  Probably in his office, there's a delay, so he was hearing it late.  Oh.  Wow.  Hot in here.  Yeah, he heard the eye.  Oh, it's getting hot.  Looks like rain.  Whoa, it certainly looks like rain tonight.  John.  Yo.  Hey.  John.  How fucking crazy are you to piss off Bernie Katz in the goddamn studio? 
[02:29:00]  That's not smart.  Yeah, I hope he's an idiot.  Ed Asner's one thing, he's 80.  Yeah, what's Ed Asner going to do?  And Ed has never shot anyone.  Exactly.  It's not like it's Psycho Patty or anything, man.  Wow, yeah.  Dude, I never expected him to go like that.  I thought he'd get a little pissed off and bummed out.  I never expected him to lose his mind like he did.  All right.  All right, thank you.  Master Poe, you all right?  No, no.  I'm going to talk to Marcelino, and I'm going to find out. 
[02:29:30]  What?  What's up?  What's up?  I want to get a patch directly into my room because this delay is no good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's why.  Yeah.  All right.  My heart is...  It's all good, bro.  Poe, you did great.  You did great.  That's good.  But I want to get a patch.  What do you do to calm down, Poe?  I heard you just kind of sit...  Poe is pissed off now, too.  Poe is freaking right now.  Nothing was going to happen.  If it came down to it, all of us would have piled on Bernie.  We just didn't want to go there.  That's all.  Here's what they call in the zone right now. 
[02:30:00]  Well, plus, there's not many problems in the studio, so when there is one, this year,  the security guy, you don't want to not be there.  15-second delay.  A lot can happen.  I'm sure, though, he shot those four guys in a lot less than 15 seconds on that subway.  Bernie can do a lot of damage.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know, no one's hearing it.  No one hears...  Yeah, the security guy, 15 seconds after the fact, he's hearing what's going on.  We've got a direct patch.  This is what we do, though.  We create major havoc, and the only ones that are enjoying it are you and I. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, I know.  Poe's pissed.  Everyone's freaked.  Why do you say we?  There's one problem in the studio.  There's one fucking irritant constantly hurting and annoying guests.  Poking and prodding of Bernie guests.  Always.  But I'm saying, you guys enjoy it, though.  Yes.  Of course.  It was incredible.  Who else was freaked out when he was running for his bag?  Bernie's probably on his way to a pawn shop right now.  Right.  Todd from California.  That man wants to be the mayor?  I know.  Jesus.  We might have wrecked his whole campaign. 
[02:31:00]  I hope he'd be the guy if we had Ted Bundy as a guest.  Let's get some girls in here naked.  Come on.  Bring in the nude girls.  They could give them a laugh dance.  A waiting pool full of mud and a 12-year-old.  Ted, here.  Hold this blunt object.  Now bring in the girls.  They're all whores, aren't they, Ted?  Come on in, ladies.  Yeah.  These girls were bringing in their filthy whores, Ted.  Here's a bat.  We got Ted Bundy audio? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, that's when he's having sex with his girlfriend.  He's telling her to lay there and pretend she's dead.  What's that from?  The movie.  Oh, the movie.  Oh, the movie.  Which one was that?  Who played him in that one?  Mark Harmon.  Was it Mark Harmon?  Yeah.  That was a good one.  I liked the Mark Harmon, Ted Bundy.  All right.  Why don't we play Craig Christ?  Or Ted Bungy, as Bernie would call him.  Did he get one name right?  Al Bundy.  Martin Scorsese.  What did he say?  Raji.  That was my favorite one.  Raji Dangerfield.  Raji Dangerfield. 
[02:32:00]  We're going to be a very dangerous man.  Bernie Gates.  Raji.  Now I keep your fucking dick.  He ran right over, pointing at all.  Oh, was he mad?  He was the irate white man.  He was fucking angry.  Michael Douglas falling down.  Right.  Falling down.  That was it.  Bernie Gates falling down.  I'm like you, man.  God damn.  I'm just like you.  That's every thug's worst nightmare is some bespectacled guy with a pistol who gets mad 
[02:32:30]  that fucking quickly.  Looks like the mild-mannered Easy Mark.  Yeah.  And he just loses his mind.  When he went out and grabbed his bag, his black bag, and put it up on the file cabinet,  I'm like, oh my God, here it comes.  Here it comes.  We're getting the best publicity we've ever had.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  As much as I'd hate to see Opie get shot, what that would do for fucking gigs for the  next year.  Oh, forget about it.  Every radio station in the country would want you on.  That would be huge.  If you pulled through, his record isn't that good. 
[02:33:00]  You know, he shot four guys and none of them died, so you'd probably live.  So much for that vegetarian angle he has.  Yeah.  So much for the vegetarians making you mellow.  Jesus Christ.  Can I have another piece of broccoli and I'll take some asparagus and...  We got a fucking CD.  We got a CD in the fucking basket.  Oh, yeah.  Enough about the friggin' soy milk and broccoli and soybeans. 
[02:33:30]  Wow.  That was great that we really got to see him do his thing.  No one gives a shit about him running for office.  We want to see you snap and go into a murderous rage.  That's what we wanted to see.  That was it right there.  It took four hours.  Of course we wanted to see that.  Four hours of horrible news.  Four hours.  It took four or five appearances.  Yeah, he's actually been on our show about four times, so it took that long to actually  make him snap.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Chris.  What's up, man?  Oh, hey.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, man. 
[02:34:00]  The best part of that whole shit was as soon as you hear the CD break, you hear Bernie Gasko,  you motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You motherfucker.  He was pissed.  You can just hear him snapping.  Is there any way to pull that audio?  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I want to know what you think he would actually have done if he actually had gotten  to Opie.  I don't know.  He probably would have hit him.  He probably would have hit him.  Yeah, I didn't want him to get to that point, so I used poor Eric as a blocker.  He would have hit you for disrespecting him. 
[02:34:30]  He used lethal force last time.  Would he have dug his thumbs into your eyeballs?  That guy would use the gun at a drop.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think he's the...  He doesn't strike me as a grappler.  No, no, no.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Maybe a bitch slap.  I saw him walking down the street looking like a raving lunatic.  He had a shovel, and he was talking about Vermont.  I don't know what that meant.  That's where his gun's buried, by the way.  That's where he buried his gun.  It's still there somewhere.  All right.  Well.  Whew.  All right.  We'll do a...  A lot of people saying don't lose Bernie as a friend of the show. 
[02:35:00]  No, we won't.  No, he'll be back.  No one else is going to let him talk for an hour about nothing.  Of course.  No one who has advertisers to answer to would allow that nonsense.  Oh, it gets worse.  More of the worst of Opie and Anthony presents ONA's most uncomfortable interviews coming up.  The worst of Opie and Anthony presents ONA's most uncomfortable interviews continues.  We're back with Opie and Anthony's worst of show because they're off. 
[02:35:30]  But Sam and I are here.  I am.  And I am Sam.  We said that already.  Oh.  Edit.  I don't pay attention.  This bit is being played by request of one of the hosts.  Well, not only by the host, but this, in terms of uncomfortable interviews, this is the interview  that comes up more often than any else.  This is the number one most requested uncomfortable moment interview right here on Total Request Live 
[02:36:00]  to Tape.  No.  It's Steve.  No Total Request.  It's Steve the Whistler.  Yes.  You thought I was going to say Steve C., didn't you?  No.  Steve the Whistler could be the most uncomfortable moment of all.  You've got to talk right into that, Mike.  When you move off, it gets really muffled.  Oh my God.  That's the last thing I want.  There you go.  Steve the Whistler, he's a world champion whistler.  You were popping your peas.  I do that on purpose.  Oh.  He's a world champion whistler.  It's my technique.  And he came in to show off his prowess. 
[02:36:30]  See?  I did it again.  Eric, if you were a world champion whistler, how do you think you would take it if somebody  decided to whistle along with you as if it took no skill at all?  That would be really irritating, considering that would be your only talent.  If it happened during an interview, would you say it would get uncomfortable?  I would think, yes.  But I think it would be even worse is if they decided to play my CD that I recorded, and  I was going to whistle along with that, and there was just an onslaught of technical issues. 
[02:37:00]  Well, studios, they're not made like they used to be.  No, that's the problem.  They're made like they used to be.  Oh.  It's Steve the Whistler, maybe the most uncomfortable moment ever, on Opie and Anthony's Most Uncomfortable  Moments.  O&A's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  All right.  Well, the next segment might get a little uncomfortable.  Dude.  What? 
[02:37:30]  Shut that door.  So it's been...  Three hours.  Three hours.  Waiting to come on our show.  Whistler's been out there.  Dude, dude.  He...  I was going to take a leak.  He comes out of the bathroom, and he's wiping his hands off, so apparently he washed his hands,  and so he goes to shake my hand.  I'm like, well, I like a man that washes his hands.  I go...  And I pointed to the No S Zone sign that is now on our bathroom door.  I had to put the sign up after yesterday.  It says No S, you know, on the door.  And I said, you didn't...  You know, and I pointed to the sign. 
[02:38:00]  He goes, no, no, no.  Whistler...  And all this, dead serious.  He goes, Whistler has to drink a lot of water.  And I've been drinking a lot of water.  Yeah, a Whistler.  He calls himself Whistler.  He goes, a Whistler.  He goes, has to drink a lot of water.  And I've been drinking since, you know, for a couple of hours now.  I'm like, oh, cool.  You know what else a Whistler has to do?  Give up all claims to box.  So then I go to the bathroom.  I come out, and he goes, my card. 
[02:38:30]  And he gives me his card.  Right.  Steve the Whistler.  International champion.  So I look.  And of course I have to go, well, international champion.  And he goes, well, since that card's been printed, I'm now international grand champion.  Dude, deadly, deadly serious.  Deadly serious.  So basically we're going to be talking to the best Whistler in the world. 
[02:39:00]  Dude, please.  He's got a CD out called Broadway and Beyond.  Steve the Whistler.  Herps.  Hold on.  Opie, use all your talents and power to describe that album cover.  I'm like, you have to.  Here.  Give me that thing.  Give me that thing.  Okay.  He's right outside.  Be quiet.  The disc.  What?  I love when he gets uncomfortable here. 
[02:39:30]  It better be turned down.  This is getting a little out of control.  It's turned down, right?  Dude.  Broadway and Beyond.  Steve the Whistler.  Herbst.  International champion.  And then there's a picture of him.  Okay.  His lips pursed in the whistling fashion.  He almost has, I guess the closest thing you could say is a slight Joey Buttafuoco look.  Would you say that?  Was this some of him?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:40:00]  Oh.  He is.  Uh-oh.  A CD that's skipping.  On the cover.  Oh, no.  He is standing on what looks to be a, the backdrop is Broadway.  And he has his hands out like an opera star, tenor or something would have if he was singing.  He's in a suit with a red bow tie.  And he's whistling on the cover.  You see his lips are like this.  He's whistling.  On the back, though, it's the cash, Steve the Whistler.  He's sporting a sweater and some pants and cowboy boots. 
[02:40:30]  As he is reclining on the back of his Aurora.  What is that?  A Buick?  Yeah.  His Buick Aurora showing his New York license plate that says, Whistler.  Whistler.  I can't get the CD.  He's like, it looks right out of some, like, turn off on Long Island somewhere, New York.  Wow.  As he's, did you see the back of this yet, Jimmy?  Jim.  Look.  All right.  Let's listen.  Let's listen to Steve the Whistler. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  What song is this, Obi?  What track?  Oh, you'll know.  Oh, I will?  Yeah.  Memories from Cats.  Wow.  Sounds like Zamphir, Master of the Pan Flute.  Wow. 
[02:41:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Every dog in Manhattan has his head slightly tilted 45 degrees.  Looking about, confused.  I was going to whistle along.  Incidentally, this picture where he's reclining, you would actually look more masculine if  you were reclining on a mule.  What's that, Stinky?  He's ready to come in.  Oh, is he? 
[02:42:00]  Okay.  Let's get Steve's.  All right.  Now, people.  People on the phones, we might need your help.  Serious questions only.  Yeah.  No fooling around today.  We want a serious interview, so we're looking for serious questions only.  Questions only.  But Steve and the whistler.  And to the phone screener, please, when you type the serious questions only, use code  words so he does not look over at the screen.  All right.  Let's all right.  Let's welcome Steve the whistler.  On to the Opie and Anthony show.  And I'm whistling a little to welcome him. 
[02:42:30]  Don't whistle in front of him.  I know.  Now, I don't want to clap my hands and go, because it might be wrong.  I might be doing it wrong.  Yep.  Now, I found out Jimmy Norton, Opie, doesn't know how to whistle.  No, maybe Steve can teach a little Jimmy Norton how to whistle.  You got a whistler hat, do you?  I saw that with a little musical note on it.  I was just going, you know, that's one of the ways I whistle.  I was pursing my lips trying to whistle, and I just can't do it.  Hey, Steve.  Thanks for your card.  Thank you. 
[02:43:00]  Steve giving Opie one of his cards.  And Opie, if I might tell you.  Steve the Whistler dot com.  Oh, Steve the Whistler dot com.  If I might tell you, Opie, where it says Steve the Whistler Herbst, and then it says  international champion, I was informed.  Well, let Steve tell.  Steve, you are not just the international champion.  No, I'm actually the international grand champion.  Grand champion.  Now, what does that entail?  Well, we have an international competition, the third week in April, down in Lewisburg, 
[02:43:30]  North Carolina.  North Carolina.  And people come from how far reaching?  Well, this year, the guy who got the award for coming the furthest was from India.  India.  And was he a good whistler?  The highest arc.  He was very good.  He was very good.  But he's no, you know, Steve the Whistler.  Well, he didn't make it to the finals.  Didn't.  Now, what are people looking for when they're judging whistling?  Well, you have a panel of judges, most of whom are musical educators.  And this year, we had a couple of former champion whistlers. 
[02:44:00]  And they're looking for a degree of difficulty of the piece you're doing.  So, if you're just doing something that's kind of easy, not a lot of note changes, they might  not look at that as seriously as somebody who's doing a lot of note changes and dynamics.  Right.  Things like that.  That wouldn't be considered competitive.  Right.  Do a lot of people enter these contests, Steve?  How many people?  Well, we have kids, teens, and adults competing.  And this year, we had 31 adults.  And of that, we had 7 women and 24 men. 
[02:44:30]  Hmm.  Now, you were first place in classical music?  Yes.  What kind of songs would you do classically?  Well, this year, in the preliminary round, I did Claire de Lune by Claude Debussy.  Claire de Lune.  Claire de Lune.  Yes, Claire de Lune.  And in the final round, I did Hungarian Rhapsody, number two, by Franz Liszt.  I don't think I've heard that one.  I probably would know it as something else, right?  You would definitely know it as something else.  As a matter of fact, it's probably been used in a lot of animated cartoons. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, well, then I probably did hear it.  Can you give us a little piece of that?  So maybe we could know what that sounds like?  I don't know if he's warmed up, Anthony.  I kind of want to hear...  No, he's warmed up.  Oh, you're warmed up there, Steve?  Yeah?  He was whistling for me.  I was whistling out there in the lobby, yeah.  Now, is this the music for it?  This is the accompanying music.  The accompanying music.  I have a question, though.  Yes, Jimmy?  Would all the whistlers laugh if a stroke victim entered?  I'm sorry, what was that?  Oh, well, let's play...  You're a horrible man. 
[02:45:30]  Let's play Steve's music.  Let's hear.  Let's hear the music.  And we'll let Steve go here.  And see if we recognize it.  You didn't know you were going to have so much intro, huh?  Well, I'm enjoying it. 
[02:46:00]  It's pretty.  And I do recognize it.  It's quite a pretty line.  Uh-oh.  There we go. 
[02:46:30]  It sounds like an instrument. 
[02:47:00]  That's very good.  How long is this song?  Too long for this. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  But that's a very good demonstration of that song.  There's a lot of dynamic to that.  Very talented.  Now, how the hell do you figure out you can do this so well?  A lot of practice behind this?  Yes.  Years and years of practice.  It's like, how do you get to Carnegie Hall?  Practice.  Practice, they say.  Now, how old were you when you first took this interest in whistling?  About seven or eight.  Seven or eight.  And did your dad maybe whistle around the house?  As a matter of fact, he did whistle, especially in the car whenever we went places, and that's 
[02:48:00]  how I got started.  And you'd join in and whistle along with dad.  They didn't have Little League in your town?  Yeah, actually, they did have Little League.  Steve, do you get a little ribbing about the whistling?  Oh, sure.  You do?  Sure.  Sure.  Do you perform live?  I do perform live.  What kind of venues would we be able to catch you at?  I have had occasion to whistle at Avery Fisher Hall, Carnegie Hall.  At Carnegie Hall. 
[02:48:30]  You took the stage at Carnegie Hall and whistled.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  And I whistled up at West Point with the cadets.  Yeah.  And, you know, different...  Actually, one of the funniest things, I was hired by Lohman's...  Yes, please.  Lohman's Department Store.  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Lohman's Department Store.  They hired me to whistle at the retirement dinner of their chairman.  Really?  Did they pick a wacky song?  No, actually, we had to pick his favorite songs.  What was some of his favorites?  Oh, New York, New York, Greensleeves, Impossible Dream. 
[02:49:00]  Do you do any songs that you wouldn't ordinarily think a whistler should be doing?  Any newer songs or something that kids might like, listen to?  Well, actually, one of the ones that you probably wouldn't expect is Sir Duke by Stevie Wonder.  Stevie Wonder, Sir Duke.  Maybe we could get a little of that, and Steve the Whistler Herbst will now whistle along...  Can't wait.  ...to Sir Duke.  Stevie Wonder, you remember this.  Stop it, Opie! 
[02:49:30]  People are going to think it's him.  Stop it!  Stop it!  I want to hear it.  Stop it!  It's a sing-along.  Yeah, everyone.  Yeah.  Oh, he went off. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, babe!  You're ruining it.  Yeah!  Right, Jimmy?  Wow! 
[02:50:30]  Stop!  Ha, ha, ha!  Oh, yeah!  Stop it, Opie!  Ha, ha, ha!  Thank you, very much.  Stop!  Would you stop?  I didn't do a whistler!  Beautiful.  That's a talent.  You're, uh...  SteveTheWhistler.com  Your lips must cramp up like a $5 hooker, though, sometimes, huh?  You ever have that happen to you? 
[02:51:00]  If I whistle long enough, they do get tired.  They do get tired.  How long would a performance be that they wouldn't just freeze up on you?  It ever happen to you?  And you go, uh-oh.  Not in a performance, no.  I can't go on, no?  Have you ever...  Do you ever do this just to be silly, though?  Like, you ever been giving oral treats to a girl, and then just stop and whistle so  it sounds like she's falling off a building?  Well, this isn't going so well.  Oh, babe!  Okay.  I didn't do anything that time.  Steve, does it annoy you if, like, when Opie started whistling over you? 
[02:51:30]  That's gotta be tough.  Only if people thought it was me.  Yeah, see?  That's what I was thinking.  Like, people are gonna think that...  I thought I did pretty well.  You did horribly.  You did horribly.  What do you think of Opie's whistling?  It wasn't even on key.  Well, he just did a day job.  Yeah.  Very good.  Well, the phones are alight with people that want to learn more about whistling.  Why can't I whistle?  It's so annoying.  I cannot whistle.  Hey, maybe you could teach Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton can't whistle.  Give it a try.  I swear to God, I have the work with my weak chin and little percy lips. 
[02:52:00]  I can't whistle, and I never...  Like you're waiting for a mama bird to regurgitate something into your mouth.  Or an Asian man to put his C in there.  What is he doing wrong?  He's blowing too hard.  Oh.  Well, I've been kicked out of many a car for that.  I want to ask Al Dukes if it's true that he had the flu during the fight on Friday.  Oh, Al Dukes.  Well, how do I do it? 
[02:52:30]  Use your ears.  How do I do it?  It sounds just like him, man.  Hey, Ryan, what's up?  Yes.  Ryan.  Hello, guys.  What's up?  We're talking to Steve the Whistler.  I can hear it.  I've been whistling for the last 20 minutes in the car.  He's fabulous.  Is it right?  I need to know his opinion on something.  Because there's nothing worse than when you have a profession associated with something bad.  And I'd like to know what he thinks about the following saying.  Whistle while you work.  Hitler was a jerk.  Mussolini was a meanie. 
[02:53:00]  But the Japs were worse.  Steve, what do you think?  What do I think about that statement?  What the hell was that?  I don't know, but whistle while you work is a nice song.  It probably is, right?  Especially if you're murdering Chandra Levy.  You know something?  I want to apologize, Steve, for that man because he doesn't have any class or couth and he can't appreciate some of the arts.  I'm not knocking and whistling.  I just think it would be funny to whistle a tune while you're digging a grave and dumping a body into it. 
[02:53:30]  Steve, he's a traveling comedian and he's in New York City this weekend and we don't have an association with him at all.  So don't mind him.  He's from L.A.  Don't mind him.  You're from L.A.?  Not originally, no.  Akron.  Akron, okay.  Let's go to Aaron.  Home of the Beacon Journal.  Yes!  Aaron!  Hey, guys.  Hey, Aaron.  How are you guys doing today?  I'm on the phone with Steve, the Whistler Herbst.  Hey, good afternoon, Steve.  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  So you've been whistling for quite a while, huh?  Oh, yeah.  For like 48 years.  Wow.  Have you acquired the ability to whistle with large objects in your mouth? 
[02:54:00]  You ever try any trick whistling like that, I guess, is what you're trying to get at?  That's a good question, yes.  No, but actually, I can whistle several different ways, including in as well as out.  Stop.  Oh, let's hear a little of that.  Let's hear a little in whistling.  Well, see if you can hear the difference.  Okay.  All right.  Everyone listen.  I hear a difference. 
[02:54:30]  It's a little more woodwind sounding on the inn.  Wait, when did he change?  I heard him change.  It was just a slight difference.  Where did you change, Steve?  He might have been watching.  That would be a giveaway.  Was it?  Oh, I wasn't supposed to tell?  You might have been cheating.  I didn't want to watch.  You could close your eyes and let it up with my ears.  Try it again, and I'll tell you exactly when you change.  Okay.  Do a different song?  I'm not looking.  I'm going to try it.  Do a different one.  Do a different one.  Now! 
[02:55:00]  No, you jack-off.  No!  Try it again.  No, you dumb bunny!  Try it again!  Okay, go ahead.  I'm not watching.  He's whistling in already.  That's out. 
[02:55:30]  Did you whistle in there?  You know something?  God bless you.  I didn't even notice that time.  I think it was that I was watching the first time.  Well, the idea is to be able to keep going, you know, without having to stop for the...  Yeah, for the breath.  Why can't I do it at all?  You can't do it at all.  Because you have a light.  Oh, God.  Look at your nothing lips trying so hard.  It might be genetic.  I don't know.  It could be genetic.  Yeah.  You see, you blow it too hard.  See, stop.  Don't blow so hard.  When I do it, nothing comes out.  My little empty...  I have a Down Syndrome tongue. 
[02:56:00]  Just lols.  Look at his face.  Levi.  What's up?  Levi.  Levi.  There's a theory out that you need to be able to curl your tongue to...  See, that's what I was...  Me and I was saying that before.  And then we just, you know, did something with each other's seas and we forgot about it.  Um, Steve, a lot of people want to know what you lubricate your lips with.  Oh, is there any special lip care that you need?  Soft and supple.  Basically, you know, a lip balm helps and water. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, water.  Lip balm and water.  Who knew?  Levi.  Recipe of champions.  Hey, what's going on?  Yes, yes.  Levi.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, I was wondering if this guy knows anything to do with upbeat classics, like maybe some  Flight of the Bumblebee?  Wow, that would be rough.  You ever try Flight of the Bumblebee?  I haven't, and that's not one of the ones in my repertoire.  Yeah, that would be a tough one.  However, the Hungarian Rhapsody, later on in the piece, is very up-tempo.  I'll have to listen to that. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, let's go to Well Hung.  Well Hung!  Hey, Steve, it sounds like it bends more when you're whistling in.  A what?  It does.  It sounds like it bends more when it's whistling in.  Like it bends more?  Yeah, the notes.  Oh, well...  Actually, I got a request for Steve.  It's not as quite a pure sound, actually.  Ah, ooh.  Steve, can you whistle I Feel Pretty and dedicated to little Jimmy Norton?  Well, yes, and actually that's on the CD, on my CD, Broadway and Beyond.  Oh, is it?  Oh, you got a CD?  Broadway and Beyond, I Feel Pretty from West Side Story, of course. 
[02:57:30]  There's a medley from West Side Story, and I Feel Pretty is one of the tunes.  All right, Steve, are you going to be performing any time soon?  Any performances coming up, Steve?  Uh, actually, uh, no, I, uh, a week or so ago I sang with the, uh, University Glee Club  of New York City.  The Glee Club!  Which I've been a member for 24 years, um, in, um, uh, Alabama School, I expect we'll  be doing a recital, uh, with my wife, because she and I, uh...  Oh, what does she do?  Well, she used to be a professional singer, and right now she's, uh... 
[02:58:00]  She uses her armpit as a company man.  She's, she's a lawyer.  She's a litigator.  Does she, uh, do any backup whistling for you?  She doesn't whistle.  Are you a single act?  Do you ever have the, uh, harmonies going on with you, uh, somebody harmonizing, whistling  or anything?  Yeah, that, that happens.  Oh, yeah?  That has happened.  I just want to know what kind of, you know, what I can expect if I ever go to a performance.  Steve, thank you so much for coming down here and enlightening us a bit on, uh, whistling. 
[02:58:30]  Well, could he leave us with a little more...  You want to leave with a little, uh, number?  A little ditty?  Sure, you want to hear, uh...  Which one, which one?  How about, uh, Maria from West Side Story?  Maria from West Side Story.  Well, I guess we can do that.  You remember, uh...  You remember that?  All right, hold on.  Very popular Broadway tune.  He needs his music, Anthony.  All right, here we go.  It's Steve the Whistler.  Uh, first, first, you still got the, uh, Aurora?  I do.  You do have the Aurora.  I do.  That is some sexy pose you got going there, Steven.  Yeah, I thought it was fun.  Eh, all right.  It's all about fun, Anthony. 
[02:59:00]  And was that picture taken out on Long Island?  No, that picture was taken in Putnam.  Really?  I thought it was D.C.  Because if you look under the tire,  I think I see Chandra's skull.  Look, he's dragging me in to his, his debauchery.  You made him happy.  Yeah, it's so great.  Look, he's trying to gather herself and live her dream.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:59:30]  What happened?  What happened?  What happened to the CD?  It didn't skip.  Rick.  Oh, my God.  Who happened?  Put it in the, um...  Oh, Steve, I'm sorry.  You put it in the wrong one, dude.  No, no.  Something happened to CD4.  All right.  Steve the Whistler.  It wasn't working last time.  I'm sorry.  SteveTheWhistler.com.  Maria, uh, which one is this?  Maria from West Side Story.  Maria from West Side Story.  All right.  Here we go again.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler. 
[03:00:00]  What?  Oh, what the hell is going on with the CD?  Dude, you got it.  That's the third time you've had a problem coming.  Clean it.  This is the same one that was skipping earlier.  Put it in the other one.  But take the CD and, uh, rub it on your helmet.  I'll try the, I'll try, uh, CD2.  Steve the Whistler.  I'll look.  I'll look, because I think...  Here we go.  From, uh, West Side Story.  Steve, I'm embarrassed. 
[03:00:30]  What the hell is wrong with this?  Turn it off and turn it on.  And, can you turn it off from the back there?  I'm doing it.  I'm holding, I'm holding the button down.  I'm holding the button.  Track four, right?  Steve, I'm sorry.  Track nine.  Track nine, right?  It'll, it'll work now, though, guarantee, because I saw the light on here, and I pressed  the breaker.  Yeah, nine.  Nine.  I'm sorry, Steve. 
[03:01:00]  It's okay.  Here we go.  Steve the Whistler.  I'm holding it down.  Uh, it popped.  Dude, it popped.  Maybe it's a CD.  It popped.  Steve, you got another CD, dude, because it was fine before.  You played other stuff on the CD.  It was fine.  Steve, you got another copy of the CD?  Damn it.  Did you burn this one yourself, Steve? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, Steve's getting another copy.  Oh, Steve, I see the problem.  Look.  Look at the back of this thing.  It's all smudged and stuff.  You got, you got some cleaner?  I'm back.  Steve, you got some cleaner?  I don't have any.  You got any clear stuff to rub on that?  No, here, give it to me.  The, uh...  No, give it to me.  I'll, I'll try to clean it with my shirt.  This happens.  Make sure you're putting it in the one that I was, uh, pressing the button on in the back.  All right.  Let's try this.  Oh, God.  Try this.  A, not B.  This is embarrassing, and this is not the way to run a goddamn, um, a radio station.  I'm sorry, Steve.  Steve the Whistler. 
[03:02:00]  Where did...  Hmm.  Um...  Hmm.  Yeah, I'm embarrassed now.  Do you want to try one more time?  We don't have to.  I mean, it's always hitting at the same time.  Acting lessons.  Whistling lessons.  I can't believe this.  Do you have another copy?  I see you're looking.  Do you have another, um...  Well, not of that particular one. 
[03:02:30]  Damn it.  But, uh, you know, we can try a different CD with a different kind of thing.  All right, let me...  Try this.  I want to hear this song.  It sounds beautiful, and, and, um...  Okay.  There seems to be a problem with the CD player.  Steve?  Not all dollars and cents.  What's wrong, Steve?  No, I was saying you, you, you were playing the, uh...  Um...  The Broadway and Beyond CD before, weren't you?  I thought I heard...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yep, yep, yep.  But it was skipping.  It was, uh, skipping.  Skipping.  The first track was skipping a little.  I...  Is it our equipment?  Because then I would really be, um...  Flabbergasted. 
[03:03:00]  Modified.  Let's try it.  Modified.  Let's try it again here.  All right.  One more time.  That's not going.  Stuck.  Oh, Jesus.  Nice tone, though, right?  Yeah, that was.  I, I, I apologize.  All right.  Oh, God.  Well, Steve, I think we're gonna have to just take your word for it.  Well, either that or do something acapella.  What do you, what do you have, um, do you have another CD of, of music? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Maybe you could do another tune?  Sure.  Rick, get that one.  Can I, uh, have, uh, the CD?  Right, no.  No, no, no.  Look, I'm gonna...  I'll check the button in the back.  All right, we solved that problem.  All right.  We solved that problem.  Where'd everyone go? 
[03:04:00]  What's wrong with you, Ben?  Steve, I work with a bunch of lunatics.  I'm sorry.  I don't know where Anthony went.  I don't know where Ben went.  Garrett, you all right?  Jim, why would you look at Steve?  I have no problem looking at Steve.  It's you I don't want to look at.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay, well, if this, if this works, we'll be, uh, doing music of the night from Phantom 
[03:04:30]  of the Opera.  Oh, we're doing...  Oh, ready?  Track, uh, nine there, Steve?  Say goodbye to your T-styles, everyone.  Oh, Steve the Whistler.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  All right.  Sounds like it's working.  He's got a website, uh, stevethewistler.com.  Yeah.  International Grand Champion.  Shh, shh, shh, here comes.  Second.  Second.  Shh. 
[03:05:00]  Whoops.  We've got farther that time.  Yeah, but this CD player is just ridiculous.  Yes, Jim.  I would...  Would it be possible, could you whistle singing in the rain while I'm raping a girl?  Well, you know, you're trying to be outrageous.  You do this every time you're here, and it's not, um...  I don't know why we have you back. 
[03:05:30]  It's not washing.  I, uh, Steve...  I think this reminds me of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Yeah.  Right.  And he's all, uh, three except for the good.  What?  Guess who the good guy is here.  I don't know.  Should be the good, the bad, the positive.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I can almost hear, uh, see Clint ride up.  No, Steve, you turned your mic off.  I did.  Yeah.  Get on.  Son of a...  You mean that didn't get on, the good, bad, and the ugly?  Uh, part of it did.  Oh, my God. 
[03:06:00]  Part of it did.  Try it again from the top.  Did you hit the, uh...  Yeah, he hit the mic by the same time.  It's going off by itself, this mic.  The mic's going off.  Uh, bring it on your tongue.  Yesterday, someone spilled water there. 
[03:06:30]  I think who took the CD player?  No, Steve, uh, hold the on button down, and it should work fine.  Well, that's what we, uh...  There's, like, a loose connection over there sometimes.  We rarely use that microphone.  They should put you on mic four.  Try it again.  Did we find another, um, CD with the other song?  Uh, not one that...  It doesn't work?  Not one that's not...  Great.  Professional.  Okay, welcome to New York City Radio and, uh, National Syndication.  You need a boombox in here.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  That would work.  Oh, you know why, Ian?  It's a CD-R.  The CD-Rs don't, uh...  The Den and CD-Rs don't, uh...  Yeah, the Den and CD-Rs don't, uh, read. 
[03:07:00]  We have one in here that does read that.  Well, these are old Den and CD-Rs, and that's why.  Do we have a boombox, though?  Could it all come in with one on his shoulder?  All right, you know, I think we gotta get Steve the Whistler out of here.  All right.  I, uh, Steve, again, I, uh, I'm a fan, and, uh, your music is beautiful.  I appreciate you coming down, and I'm sorry about the, uh, technical glitches, and, uh,  especially Jim Norton.  Uh, well, it's been fun to be here, and...  He's really an awful man.  But hopefully, uh, you know, if I come back again someday, uh, we'll... 
[03:07:30]  Absolutely.  ...we'll work out the technical difficulty.  Let's do that, then, Steve.  Steve, thank you.  Uh, give out the website once again.  That's www.stevethewhistler.com.  All right.  Uh-huh.  It went off the air.  The button went off.  What?  www.stevethewhistler.com.  Yeah!  Jesus.  All right, Steve, uh...  It was Steve...  I got the Steve part.  All right.  Steve, that's www.stevethewhistler.com.  Okay.  And the CD is Broadway and... 
[03:08:00]  Broadway and Beyond.  And Broadway and...  You can act like a man!  Broadway and Beyond.  Watch out!  Gotcha.  And, uh, and that's that, I guess.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve, thank you so much again.  And, uh, we'll talk to you soon.  Thanks.  Okay.  I'm sorry I said those things.  You should be.  Walk out Steve the Whistler as we go to news with, uh, with, um...  Well, I hope that works again.  Steve, thank you so much.  At, uh, 628, it's, uh, time for news and, uh...  Yes, yes.  And traffic. 
[03:08:30]  With, uh, Debbie.  Debbie!  What's going on on the roadways today?  Oh, yes.  It's always such a cluttered mess out there, isn't it, Debbie?  Debbie?  Yeah.  Debbie!  Debbie!  Debbie!  Debbie!  Debbie!  Where's, uh, Debbie?  Debbie, the U-20...  Now he's...  Exactly, because Jimmy said that.  Jimmy goes, um...  Holy Jesus.  I'm sorry I said that stuff.  Is it done?  Shut up, you dick.  Go talk to Steve so we can talk a little bit.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Make sure everything's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  When you were handing...  He's...  Opus beckoning to me over the...  I know.  ...the CD.  That's when I fled my seat.  I left my seat.  I was embarrassed to be on this program.  I knew he was going to break it.  Oh, he goes, uh, Jimmy, could you hand...  Could you hand that over?  And I'm looking at Ophie going, no, he is absolutely not going to do this.  But then I knew you did, and I got up and went behind your equipment.  Yeah, and that's what made me laugh harder, is that you just took the coward's way out  and hid behind the machinery. 
[03:09:30]  I can't sit here where that's going on.  So uncomfortable.  When he kept turning off the goddamn CD player.  Ben hid in a spot, like, way under the console.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  When you kept turning off his music, like, right at the beginning when he started whistling,  I couldn't hold a straight face.  That's why I had to leave.  I had to leave.  I went behind the equipment and cried.  My tears were back there.  God, that's so embarrassing.  I can't, I can't, I can't deal with situations like that. 
[03:10:00]  No, I'm bored with that.  I freaked out.  The first was that in the background with the machines.  Yeah, I'm holding the button in.  I had to leave the situation.  Co-host chortling behind the scenes.  I had to leave.  This is what happens when guests go wrong.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony presents ONA's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  Welcome back to Opie and Anthony's Most Uncomfortable Interviews show.  My name is Irak.  He is not Sam.  This is not the uncomfortable interview part. 
[03:10:30]  This is just the introduction.  This is the next segment.  Deuce-chilling intro part of the show.  That we are contractually required to do.  Now, Eric, we've said on the show many times, this is the most uncomfortable interview special.  Yes.  We've said many times that we get a lot of big stars on the Opie and Anthony show.  We do.  But only when they have to promote very shitty projects.  And usually when Roland wasn't working with us.  Willem Dafoe.  This one sticks out for me because I remember being in studio the entire time. 
[03:11:00]  And I don't say this about celebrities, usually.  You screamed and jumped out the window because the Green Goblin had come.  Almost.  Yeah.  But this guy was a total dick.  Wow.  He was in promoting.  He rocks showing brass balls.  He was in promoting the movie Animorph, which also had a role for our friend Mick Foley.  That's fucking right.  And he knocked it out of the park.  And Mick was in right before that to promote the movie.  Even Mick said the movie was a piece of shit.  What?  But he got the act.  Mick's part was good, though.  Yes.  This part was not.  No. 
[03:11:30]  Because Willem Dafoe would not let the conversation go in whatever direction that O&A wanted to go.  Like a normal human being.  Exactly.  When you have someone like Willem Dafoe in studio, you want to talk about their whole career,  they're a legend, this and that.  No.  Willem Dafoe strictly wanted to talk about this dumb movie that he must have gotten a producer  credit for because he had to have some kind of money invested in it.  Hello, mystery guests.  We're talking about what a dick Willem Dafoe is.  What do you think?  It's just a very big dick. 
[03:12:00]  Shalom, bitches!  It's Willem Dafoe on O.B. and Anthony's Most Uncomfortable Moments.  O&A's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony show in studio.  Wow, Willem Dafoe.  Very, very excited to have Willem on the radio program.  I don't know if he's excited, but we are.  At least he's being honest.  I've done a million of these.  Let's just get this over with so I can go to the next one. 
[03:12:30]  No.  It's not quite like that.  Promotional things.  I once saw Willem Dafoe downtown, just walking around Mercer Kitchen, to be exact, and I  actually crossed the street because you're a scary, scary man in your movies.  I don't know you personally, but you have that type of an aura about you that I'm like,  I don't want contact with this guy.  Really?  I will look at him from the other side of the street.  I suppose it depends on what movie you see. 
[03:13:00]  True.  Well, when you did the turn and started being like the innocent nice guy in movies, that  was awesome because everyone expected you to be the scary guy.  Right, right.  I suppose when I started out, that's what I was mostly doing.  Yeah.  You play a great nice guy and also a great creep.  You play really well both like a great psychopath and also like a great hero like in Platoon.  Or in the film we starred in together, Spider-Man.  Oh, yes.  Well, Jimmy was in Spider-Man.  You guys got a film.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  I remember that.  Yeah, you know, a lot of people credited me with basically, it was the turning point in  the film for those that didn't see it.  Jimmy was billed as Surly Truck Driver.  Yeah.  And he delivered a line.  We actually have it because we're very proud to have him in a blockbuster movie like that.  So this is his line actually from Spider-Man.  He stinks and I don't like him.  See?  He's the guy that said he stinks and I don't like him when they did the montage of people  commenting on Spider-Man. 
[03:14:00]  That was a cool part of the movie.  Yeah.  It's very polite of him too.  I love this guy.  He's actually a great actor.  He's like, yes, I remember that that well.  You have something in common.  No, seriously.  You have something in common.  You both didn't like Spider-Man, which is very good.  That's true.  Yeah, but he had, I think, a few more scenes with him.  Just a couple more.  Just a couple more scenes.  Obviously, you're in some of my favorite movies.  I don't realize how many good movies you're in until I look at the biome.  I'm like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  And I just saw Born on the Fourth of July again the other night.  You've done so many great things. 
[03:14:30]  Mississippi Burning, another one of my favorites.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, good.  Yeah, great.  What do you want from me?  There really was no question there.  I was basically just telling a man I liked that you did that.  You're kissing his ass.  I say thank you.  Why don't you add Platoon to that list?  Because I didn't want to do them all at once.  I'm going to run out of great movies.  You're a New York guy?  Yeah, I've lived here pretty much my adult life.  Because I think everybody has their Willem Dafoe sightings.  Do people come up to you or they're intimidated? 
[03:15:00]  Because I know when I saw you, you were walking by.  I just left a restaurant.  And I just go, you know, you go, the holy crap, that's Willem Dafoe.  And you want to do something.  You want to kind of step up and say hi or can I get a picture?  But you never know what your vibe's going to be.  People in New York are pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're sweet and they're basically encouraging.  They basically say, you know, say I like what you do or whatever.  They don't ask for much.  And leave you alone, though, for the most part, too? 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  You know, say hello.  Act like, you know, it's a normal thing and we're good friends.  Yeah.  Because you're pretty recognizable.  I'm around.  You're around.  You lashed out in an article, it says here, and you're saying that people are too obsessed  with the kind of puritanical thing in our society.  You know.  What were you?  Yeah, exactly.  These things always need a little context.  No, not misquoted at all.  You know, I was on this talk show and they were talking about a movie, a smaller movie,  and the guy was obsessing on, he made the assumption that it wasn't a successful movie 
[03:16:00]  because it didn't make a lot of money.  And I just said, hey, be careful, you know, don't just look at the grosses and judge the  movie on that.  Some movies aren't meant to make $200 million.  It would be nice if they did, but they're not made for a big audience.  Mass appeal or whatever.  Right, right.  And I think those movies are worth making.  That was my point.  So I just said, you know, like ever since grosses started to get printed on movies and all 
[03:16:30]  these magazines kind of sprang up around the business, around the business, everybody  thinks they know the movie business and they follow it like they follow the stock market  and they kind of forget what it's all about.  Right.  It's movies, not just about making money.  Are the scripts bad?  I mean, it seems like...  That's a leading question.  But I mean, like, it seems like we were talking about Pacino yesterday.  I don't know, Coppola kind of lashed out at Pacino, Nicholson, and De Niro.  Yeah, but I think he took that back. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, did he take it back?  Yeah, because it was out of context.  In fact, I had the occasion to speak to him about that.  Yeah, because that was kind of a weird group of threes to attack.  But I was looking at some of the movies, Pacino and De Niro, and of course you can't  criticize them as actors.  But it just seems like it's the same script getting turned over and over, which probably  means they get to choose what they want to do.  So it's probably just not as many great scripts out there.  Well, for me, you know, you always lament this.  There's not...  You're always saying, oh, the material ain't great, you know. 
[03:17:30]  But no, I don't think that's particularly true.  The thing that is true is I think there's really big movies and there's really small movies,  and the middle has dropped out.  And it's like anything.  It's, you know, like even like a society that doesn't have a big middle class.  It gets a little shaky.  Yeah.  You know?  Now, I think that's true.  But then you try to, you know, I try to do some small ones.  I try to do some big ones.  But the tendency is on the big ones, because they've got to cover their nuts, so to speak. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  They've got to know what they're selling.  There's less risk taking, so they generally tend to want to repeat themselves, repeat their  successes, and use you the same way that you've been used before.  So it's not always.  Sometimes it's great making a big movie.  But I tend to live in the independent world more where just generally more personal and  more risky films can be made.  It does make sense what you're saying, though. 
[03:18:30]  Like, why do they all have to be judged on box office receipts when, you know, you're looking  at something that's art.  Well, we get sucked into it.  It can be entertainment.  It can be junkie.  It can be art.  It can be all kinds of things.  But I guess my point is there's a fundamental philosophical thing about if something doesn't  make money, you know, we think that if something is in the marketplace, the cream will rise to  the top.  No, it's not.  It's like, you know, you look at a specialty food store. 
[03:19:00]  You know, it's not a big chain supermarket.  It has different intentions.  I'm amazed that some of these movies come out and the reviews are horrendous and then  it's number one at the box office.  I'm like, doesn't the public pay attention and do a little work on their own?  I think they don't, you know.  And I'm not like saying that the reviews should be, you know, because some of these reviewers  are way off, too.  But when you get a general review and it's very obvious that this is one of these comedies  that's been done a million times and it's awful and it's getting a half a star and then 
[03:19:30]  you look Monday morning, it's the number one movie at the box office.  Hey, you know, those are usually movies where people have a relationship to it and it's  got a big first weekend and then after that it takes a nosedive.  I mean, you create a relationship with people.  But is marketing that powerful, you think?  Yes.  Marketing's huge.  It gets huger and huger.  Because then all the lemmings just go to the movie theater and see this piece of crap  and how many times have you been in a movie theater and you hear people yelling and screaming  as the credits roll, like, oh, that was a bunch of crap and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, some people, you know, some of the times event movies, you know, people, their expectation 
[03:20:00]  is very low, but they'll go anyway because they got to check it out.  Right, right.  Because, you know, it's in the air.  Wait for it to go on DVD or something.  But, you know, the other thing is when people decide what to do, like for a weekend or they  got some free time, sometimes there's a tendency that, you know, you want to go, you want to  know what you're getting.  If you go with a friend or you go with a girlfriend, you know, you don't want to fight with them 
[03:20:30]  about the meaning of the movie or be traumatized, you know.  So some people kind of like to kick back and kind of do something reassuring and familiar.  What was your favorite movie that no one saw?  Oh, God, that's a tough one.  There's a lot of them.  That was a really good movie and a lot of people should have seen.  I'm not talking about a real obscure artsy piece, but something that really was a solid  movie, but because it didn't have the marketing or the mass appeal, no one went and saw.  Damn, you set me up and I can't think of one right off the bat.  Okay.  There's plenty, though. 
[03:21:00]  Just because, you know, it's all about timing and awareness and sometimes great movies slip  through the cracks and sometimes really mediocre movies get, you know, elevated and called  great.  It's normal.  What's the most intense scene?  I mean, we were talking about a scene the other day.  What's the most intense scene that you've done since you've been doing films?  Oh, God.  And, you know, what comes to mind is always really extreme physical stuff, I suppose,  you know, being crucified was pretty intense. 
[03:21:30]  That's pretty intense.  Not just because physically it was difficult, but also no matter how you're brought up, you  know, you have such associations to that.  Right.  That, you know, assume the pose and a lot of emotions come with that.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Were you, on the set now, on The Last Temptation, were you a little bit pompous to the rest of  the people just because you were...  Pompous?  Well, just because you were posed.  No, the story was about this guy being a regular Joe, so, you know, pompous, hell no. 
[03:22:00]  I was too busy.  That was a movie...  One of the pleasures of that movie is you went out every day and you worked, worked, worked,  worked, worked, and then you worked till you dropped and then you went back to that little  hotel, modest hotel in Morocco, you know, in the place.  I was in Morocco and then woke up and did the same thing.  Were you surprised at all the flack it caught?  Yeah, I was.  I was.  Really?  Yeah, because the heart of the movie is very sincere and deals with spiritual stuff and, 
[03:22:30]  you know, on some level it was a very thoughtful movie.  I mean, in this, uh, in an age where, you know, there's slasher movies and stuff like  that, you know, they're objecting to this movie, but you've got a different take on a  familiar story.  Right, right.  It was Christ's, uh, what was it?  There was a sexual fantasy about Mary Magdalene or something like that, that that was what  said everybody...  Eh, that was part of it.  It was, it was more, it was more about, it was just a reinterpretation, uh, trying to, 
[03:23:00]  uh, um, check into the more, uh, less the divine side and more the human side of, uh, the  Jesus Christ character.  No.  Hey, guys, you gotta plug this movie.  We're going to.  Yes.  We're heading that way.  You have so much history, though.  Yeah, it's really hard to just talk about the new...  I'm happy to talk to you, but I'm thinking, man...  It's gotta be awful that when you come in and you've got so many great films, it's like  everybody wants to talk about the work, um... 
[03:23:30]  No, that's...  Well, the new movie's Animorph, and, uh, we...  I'm sorry, I...  It's all good.  That way we're going.  No, it's fine.  I go, I do gigs on the road and there's nothing worse than when you're like 15 minutes into an interview  and you're like, ah, plug in.  I'm not here to just hang out with you guys.  I know, we're acting like it's our living room.  Right.  Dumps.  Animorph.  I checked it out last night.  Yeah, yeah, what do you think?  A nice serial killer movie there.  Yeah, I mean, I like it.  Very dark?  It's very dark.  I like...  For me, from an actor's perspective, it's, uh, you know, very much a character piece.  It's character-driven. 
[03:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, there's some very interesting ideas in there and, uh, a lot of good visual, uh, ideas  as well.  Oh, absolutely.  I'll say one thing for it.  There's what you think is going to wind up happening.  Like, they're setting something up.  I felt like they were setting something up through the part of the movie and, uh, it's  not what happened, which I kind of liked because I think, oh, okay, I know where this is going  and I didn't know where it was going.  Mm-hmm.  Um, and it really was.  I said you play a great creep because you came off, even though you were not supposed  to be a creep, you came off really just dark and uncomfortable. 
[03:24:30]  It was really, uh...  He's a pretty alienated cat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to explain your character in Animorph?  Uh, well, he's a, he's a...  He's an older detective at the end of his career.  Yeah, and he's, he's really comes, well, he's called in to investigate a series of murders  that are eerily similar to a series of murders that he solved five years earlier.  So, of course, that begs the question whether, A, did he get the right guy and, B, or whether 
[03:25:00]  it's a copycat.  Copycat, sure.  So, he's got to do some soul searching and somewhere in his past, he's got some un, he's  got some unresolved things and it really sends him, as he goes deeper and deeper into the  investigation, he goes deeper and deeper into his past and, uh, you know, some stuff that  he's never quite fessed up to.  Mm-hmm.  It was really interesting film work.  Um, it really, it just had a really weird, dark, creepy feel to it.  I know that's not a great description, but it really, like... 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, but if you're going to film a serial killer type of movie, that's, that's the way  to go, right?  Yeah, I don't think of it as a serial...  I really, I really think it's hung on this guy's, you know, descent into, uh, a dark past.  Mm-hmm.  And that's what I like about it and I, I also like it's very, um, it's, it's got a great  New York feel.  Mm-hmm.  It's no accident that we shot it here.  It, it feels like a New York movie we shot in places that are very specifically New York.  Except for the fact, like, uh, you're driving home and you just have a parking space right 
[03:26:00]  in front of your building.  I mean, come on.  That was, man, that was a little hard to swallow for me, too, but...  What world do you live in?  He just pulls up to his apartment building, oh, parking space in front of the building  once again.  We live in a lucky world where the crew controls the traffic, hopefully.  Besides that, yes, very New York.  And there was some great, uh, really some really great, uh, dissembled torsos in this.  There was some really fantastic...  Yeah.  There's some good visual effects. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, man.  There was some really great, like, pieces of bodies hanging all over.  It was just, like, really revolting.  Some of the, uh...  Is this, is this what we call a spoiler?  No, not at all.  Not really.  No.  You gotta think that the guy's killing somebody, right?  You know, yeah, the serial killer wasn't, he wasn't, uh, he's smothering them.  I thought of Jimmy when I was watching this movie, because he's a huge fan of serial  killers in general.  This guy knows more about serial killers than anyone I've ever met in my life.  I wouldn't say facts.  He could rattle off names and, and facts and what his, uh, specialty was.  You know, I was just...  And not the basic ones. 
[03:27:00]  He goes deep.  Yeah?  You really know that stuff.  Yeah, Bundy was a hack.  You know how it is.  You know, I was thinking the other day, uh, doing some press stuff for this.  I, I've got a connection to serial killers because my father knew Ed Gein.  Really?  Wow.  Ed Gein, I guess.  Yeah, he, ooh.  He was a biggie.  He is a biggie.  He grew up in the same town as Ed Gein.  Wow.  I have a, this guy Andrew made me a coffee mug.  Two Ed Gein coffee mugs.  One had, like, uh, the top half of the victim on it. 
[03:27:30]  And it was actually, like, a really nice piece of art.  And the, and the bottom, it was a painting that he did.  And it had the, the bottom half of the, the victim.  Is he the one that said, and I don't know if this is an accurate quote, uh, when I see  a girl who's pretty, I think two things, what it would be like to date her.  And then the second thing is what her head would look like on a stick.  That was, it might have been him that said that.  Was that him or no?  That was you.  Doesn't sound right.  Okay, no, that sounds like, we can thank Hollywood for that one.  Right.  But I don't know.  No, that was actually in a serial killer book.  One of the guys actually said that. 
[03:28:00]  Hey, baby, you're the expert.  No, I didn't know who it was.  It was Ted.  How did your father know him?  Did, were they on the same baseball team or anything like that?  No, he lived in the same town.  He was like a handyman in the town.  Oh, that is.  He was handy, all right.  Yeah.  And babysitter, that kind of thing.  A lot of people obsessed with serial killers.  I don't know why.  I don't know what that taps into, but.  Well, I don't know, but we sure have our share of them in this country, don't we?  Absolutely.  Well, it shows you how far people can go, I think.  It shows you, like, it's like they're never running around with a big funny hat and an axe.  I mean, it's always like people that live next door to you. 
[03:28:30]  And, you know, I think that's the interesting part is you see how far your fellow citizens can go  and how dark and awful it can.  That's what's interesting.  I mean, that's why a movie about them is interesting.  It's just, I don't know.  And I've got to bring up something, To Live and Die in L.A., which I thought was a cool movie.  No, very cool movie.  Yeah.  That scene, you've got to kiss a guy in that scene.  Yeah.  In the beginning.  What is that like for an actor when they say, look, you've got to kiss this guy?  And it's a pretty passionate kiss. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, you know, it's, you know, you're playing a scene, what can I say?  Is that it?  All a day's work.  Close your eyes and enjoy it.  It just seems like one of those things where you're like, ah, God, it's in the script.  The script looks good, but.  No, the cool thing about that was Billy Friedkin, who's really a great director,  and really I loved working with on that.  He, well, maybe I shouldn't tell you this.  No, I can tell you this.  What the hell?  Yeah, well, promote Animorphs. 
[03:29:30]  Come on, let's go.  It's two shots.  Yeah, yeah.  It's two shots, and you're tracked behind a guy's back, you know?  So it looks like a man.  Right.  Walks like a man.  Everything like a man.  And then you see me go up and greet him with a smile and give him this deep kiss.  And then the camera turns around and it's revealed as a woman.  As a woman, right.  Of course, it's two shots, but we have to start the kiss in the one shot.  Yeah.  And this poor guy that was a guy that I kissed was a dancer, a straight guy, very, very, probably 
[03:30:00]  all his life, you know, having to assert that he's straight.  Yeah.  Comes from a world where a lot of people are gay, you know?  So the guy was unusually uptight about this.  And the director says, oh, don't worry about it.  It's no big deal.  He'll just come up to your face and then we'll cut.  And then Billy goes over to me and says, kiss the shit out of him. 
[03:30:30]  It does look extremely uncomfortable and unnatural the way, like, the hand goes to the back of  the head.  It looks like they're not really into this until you see that scene cut and you notice  that it's a woman.  And then it looks a little more natural and, like, people are enjoying themselves a little  more.  But, uh...  Okay.  And you do play quite the bastard in that movie.  To Live and Die in L.A. is a great flick if you haven't seen it.  You know, that...  That's a really good one.  You were talking about movies. 
[03:31:00]  I mean, how weird success or not success is.  When that movie opened, it was a big flop.  Really?  And it really survived only later, uh, you know, in after life.  Yeah.  And also became, at least in my experience, uh, popular among film people and film directors.  It was an important movie early in my career, but it was a real flop.  And I remember what the reviews said and it was interesting.  They'd say, there are no people to root for. 
[03:31:30]  There are no people to identify with.  And, uh, this is a world full of scum.  And I thought, well, that prefigured, you know, Quentin Tarantino world by, like, ten years.  Sure.  You know?  Yeah, that's, uh, there's nothing wrong with that.  No.  I mean, what the hell?  It's, uh, yeah.  We watch movies like that all the time.  You get bothered by bad reviews?  You know?  Do you read them at this point?  I do.  I try not to read them.  I really don't.  Because a lot of times, you know, uh, because of the short form and because the level is 
[03:32:00]  very low, the critical writing on film is quite low usually.  But sometimes I read them because if it's very good, people are telling you about it.  You want to check it out.  If it's very bad, people are telling you about it and you want to check it out.  Because usually, and then you can decide for yourself.  So, it's like the not knowing is worse.  But generally speaking, I, you know, I like to know, uh, how it's going, what the response  was.  But I don't read them. 
[03:32:30]  It's too, it's too depressing.  It, it can, it can stick in your head.  That's interesting because you have nothing to prove as far as your, uh, film career goes.  I got plenty to prove.  But it's nice to know you're...  You're only as good as your last five minutes.  Well, yeah.  It's nice to know you're human, you know, because we're affected by message board postings  and what some idiot says about us in a dumb local paper.  Remember, don't, don't go there.  I mean, you could drive yourself nuts.  Yeah.  Because, um, also, particularly with the internet, you know, you got, the internet is mostly run 
[03:33:00]  by 12-year-old kids, you know.  Everyone's an expert.  Everyone's an expert.  Or at least cops pretending to be.  And, you know, you can tell by the spelling and the syntax and all that, you know, that these  are kids, you know.  And, and stuff gets in the internet and just sticks there and kind of festers, so.  What was, go ahead, Jimmy.  I'll say, what's one that got to you?  There had to be one that was written by a critic that, who you, you legitimately wanted  to strangle.  Because it didn't...  There's, there's, there's lots of them.  But one I can think of particularly was, uh, I made a, a small personal film on another 
[03:33:30]  one of these movies that I, I was not a, you know, going to reach the huge audience.  And a critic, um, for a variety reviewed it at the Venice Film Festival.  And it was a, it was a movie, a small movie, an art movie.  And it was like, it got under her skin.  And she just did everything to kill it.  And early in a, uh, uh, in, uh, the life of a movie sometimes, a prominent review can 
[03:34:00]  really hurt it.  And she sort of willfully knew that.  And she killed the distribution, basically, on the movie because of a very, very negative,  one person could do that.  Unnecessarily negative review.  Wow.  Yeah.  But, you can cry about this stuff.  It's called Before It Had a Name.  And, uh, you can get it on, uh, video.  But, um, it didn't really get much of a release here.  But you, you gotta be careful because they recut it in, uh, in most of the, uh, most of 
[03:34:30]  the videos here.  But, uh, outside of this country, it's our cut.  Right, right.  Gotcha.  So you must hate our guts.  I mean, I, I don't...  I hate whose guts?  Exactly.  That awful woman.  Yeah.  From Variety.  Yeah.  I, you know, to set it up, I should have told you more.  But then, anyway, let's forget this.  I should have gone there.  But, you know, she stays with me, huh?  Yeah, she should.  She stinks. 
[03:35:00]  I hate critics.  I hate them.  Willem, uh, obviously you did a lot of...  She's a would-be filmmaker, too.  Of course she is.  Of course.  You obviously did a lot of huge, uh, films.  What's, what's your favorite film that you, uh, you did?  Oh, God.  You know, I, uh, people ask me and I, I can't, I, I don't know.  You can't even choose one?  No, I really can't.  One that's up there?  No, you know, you name something.  They're all your babies?  They're, I'm afraid.  You like them all?  It's afraid, yeah, it's true.  And the other thing I remember is once I heard some guy, a guy who I wasn't crazy about, 
[03:35:30]  he had a movie, he had a movie that I thought, this time, wow, he really did something beautiful.  And I heard him on some talk show or something, trashing that movie.  And I thought, oh, babe, you ruined it for me.  I was fine with that.  It's the other stuff that I can't bear.  So, it's like, what I think isn't important, what I think, you put into the work and then,  you know, one man's meat is another man's poison.  So, I don't want to guide anybody by telling them what I like.  I liked American Psycho.  I thought it was a hysterical movie. 
[03:36:00]  Hysterically funny movie.  Beautifully made movie.  But when you say something like that, that's something that, I think it's a great movie,  but I didn't feel, you know, central to it.  It's not hung on me.  I tend to be proudest of the ones that turn out well where I'm a central figure.  Yeah, well, Platoon was very important.  Or I have a strong part, you know.  Platoon was an important movie for its time, especially.  It was kind of one of the first in the Vietnam genre that kind of showed it a little more realistically. 
[03:36:30]  It's true.  And it was a personal movie, and it was real fresh, because, you know, this movie,  man, when we were out there, you know, you looked around, and most, I had only made a couple of movies,  and most of the people around had made no movies.  So, it had a real freshness to it, and passion from Oliver, because that was a very personal story.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you ever been embarrassed in a, because, I mean, I've been very few small, awful films. 
[03:37:00]  Literally, I've probably been in three of the four worst films ever done.  Tell me.  One was called White Chicks Incorporate.  It's so bad.  Sounds good.  I can't even watch it, like, ironically.  Like, uh-huh.  Okay.  We were in the...  What did you do in that?  Oh, I played such an ass.  A boss or something?  What's that?  A boss?  No, no, no.  I played famous comedian Jim Norton, where I had to, like, act like I was just a big comedian.  I was really humiliating.  Sounds good.  Yeah, yeah.  I believe it.  I'd rather describe a pedophilia testimony than what I'm telling you. 
[03:37:30]  And I was in this little theater watching this premiere.  And I wanted to commit suicide.  It was so embarrassing to watch myself.  Like, have you ever been watching it or watching the work they did with the film and just wanted  to just get out?  No, sometimes you get disappointed on, you know...  Oh, okay, now?  Yeah, sure you do.  And, you know, it's always a game.  You know, you got people and they fail you and they surprise you, you know.  So, it's fun.  Because you make this little family around this thing for a while. 
[03:38:00]  And some people step up to the plate and other people kind of fall on their face.  And so you're proud when they do.  And when they don't, you know, you say, eh, that's too bad.  So, he's got a couple of huge movies there, Jimmy, to look back on when he's looking at  one that maybe isn't one that he's most proud of.  You have side splitters, if you want to...  Right, which is a 20-minute just work of art.  It's kind of like Platoon.  But 20 minutes with me and stupid Louis Black.  But no, it was just... 
[03:38:30]  It's interesting to ask somebody who's got such a body of work.  Like, is there times where...  Because I don't have a body of film work.  You know, I get a couple of small, awful ones.  And it's, you know, I'm not really an actor.  But it's got it.  You have to know.  Like you said, you know.  You have to know when you're watching.  You're like, oh, this is just not what I wanted.  Yeah, sometimes.  You know, and it's rough.  Because you make something and then someone else orders it and turns it into something else.  So, sometimes they can help you out and make you look good.  Other times they can think something beautiful that was there.  But, so, you know, it's a trust game and a risk game. 
[03:39:00]  Hey, did you get to see Madonna's, you know, private when you filmed that scene?  Whoa!  Did you get a little peek?  Did you get a little peek?  Give us a little something here.  Because she seems to be a little bit on the, let's really do this.  Oh, she's cool.  That means she's method.  No, it wasn't like that.  But it was, yeah.  Well, you got a big smile on your face, so there's something there. 
[03:39:30]  And a more.  Once again, the movie, what is it about for the people that are just tuning in to the Willem Dafoe interview?  Okay.  It's about a detective that's investigating a series of murders that are very much like a series of murders that he solved years ago.  And it puts some doubts in his mind and kind of forces him to go back into some questions he had about some things that he did in the past.  So, it's something of a ghost story.  I mean, in the respect that he confronts himself. 
[03:40:00]  Right.  Right.  It's really dark, and there are some really weird, creepy scenes in it.  I'm not saying that in a very good way.  No, no, I'm not saying that bad.  It's a circular movie.  It shouldn't be like yellow balloons in the corner.  It was a very dark, interesting movie.  Even the corner is a creep.  It was just, oh yeah.  Oh, he was just a creepy guy.  I love him.  Yeah.  And you walk right in without putting the stuff under your nose.  You just don't care.  I love that.  Yeah, you're just right in there with the corner checking things out.  She's got her coat on.  That means you've got to get to another interview. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  It's the great Willem Dafoe.  We're all huge fans, obviously.  And thanks for stopping by.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'm talking to you.  This is what happens when guests go wrong.

This one features probably one of my favorite guests that we have on the show, Patrice O'Neal. 
[03:41:30]  Well, Patrice calls it like it is, and that can oftentimes lend itself to uncomfortable moments.  And extreme hilarity.  Yeah, that's true too.  The lingerie bowl girls.  These are girls who play football in lingerie.  Yeah, this was back in 2006.  Lingerie bowl was designed to compete against the halftime at the Super Bowl.  Right.  Like halftime heat.  The lingerie bowl.  No one remembers that.  Well, somebody laughed.  MTV.  They came in to talk about what they were going to do during halftime. 
[03:42:00]  One girl left her coat on, though.  And listen.  When it comes to the lingerie bowl, it's not about who can talk the best.  It's not about who can play football the best.  Nope.  It's about looking at you in lingerie.  Yes.  Patrice O'Neal was there to point this out to the girls' faces.  Patrice loves nothing more than if a girl or a group of girls is standing right in front of him.  He'll find the one girl who's got something a little off.  That's what he did. 
[03:42:30]  It's lingerie bowl girls and Patrice O'Neal on Opie and Anthony's most uncomfortable moments in interviews.  ONA's most uncomfortable interviews.  Hey, girls.  Hello.  Hi.  Wowee.  Hi, ladies.  Oh, well.  We got girls.  Girls in the studio.  Girls in the studio.  Woo.  Were you enjoying the radio?  We didn't mean to make you wait that long, but we were on a roll there with the country music and stuff.  Sounded funny. 
[03:43:00]  It sounded funny?  You guys were entertaining, I'll say.  Thank you very much.  Definitely.  Look at that.  We're entertaining.  Thanks.  You guys are on the webcam.  Why do two black girls outside like fucking niggas?  Yeah, what's up with the black girls?  They weren't hot enough?  No.  One's our tour manager.  Bring these bitches in here so I can have some fucking fun.  They don't want to be in here.  Yeah, bring her in.  Benita.  I'm looking like five light bulbs.  My eyes are on for my cornea burning.  Bring something to fucking lower the fucking...  You don't know what a tungsten down in this motherfucker. 
[03:43:30]  Jesus.  You know how pathetic we are, man?  We got girls from the lingerie bowling studio and one of them's wearing a winter coat over her lingerie.  Yeah.  That's how scared they are of us.  We're the worst.  You guys realize that I'm not a cheerleader.  I'm a tour manager.  Oh, we thought you were...  No.  Oh, wow.  But she could be.  Put it in very nicely.  I can go back.  No, I want to look at her.  No, maybe you can help us.  Oh, hi.  The one in the coat is the fucking cunt.  Like, she's the asshole. 
[03:44:00]  She's not controlled.  She's out of control.  She's the only one without a phony fucking smile plastered on her face.  She hates this shit.  You got dreams and aspirations, don't you, dear, Puddin' Pops, huh?  Well, give them up and go down the road of hell like the rest of these fucking girls here.  Stop trying to have dignity.  I'm going to wear a coat.  I'm not just about tits and smiling, you motherfuckers.  And you know why it's true?  Her friends are laughing at her.  Get rid of her.  She's bringing your whole porno group down.  Jesus Christ.  I can fucking sniff it. 
[03:44:30]  Look at her.  She's just like...  Patrice, excuse me, allow me to retort.  Well, let the girl in the winter.  Perhaps the air conditioning is so fucked up in this place all the time that it's chilly.  It's not affecting Blondie.  Thank you.  Everybody has different temperatures.  The girl is beautiful.  They have been outside in the crazy cold weather in New York.  We're from California.  We're not used to that.  We're not used to that.  We're not used to that.  Oh, boy.  And what she's doing now? 
[03:45:00]  Patrice.  She does that every time you come out.  Get rid of her.  But she's...  She does that every time.  She brings it down.  No, you do that every time.  What?  I'm just saying.  Now they're going to act like they heard about it.  That girl is fine.  I would love...  What was her name?  Danielle.  Danielle.  Danielle.  She's a beautiful, fine girl.  I won't say anything else.  She's a classy, very nice girl.  Of course.  Did you hear...  What's your name again, pumpkin?  Benita. 
[03:45:30]  Did you hear Benita has...  She has a script in her head that she says all the time when she has to cover up for Miss  Jacket.  Well, we were disappointed that she came in with a winter coat over her lingerie.  Well, she's cold.  She's...  But you're not cold.  I'm from Michigan originally.  She's from Michigan.  I can take it.  So it depends where you were born, I guess.  You're naked.  I am partly naked.  Yeah, they got their tops on and their tight jeans.  I was disappointed about the coat.  And you're all black.  And you know how we don't like the fucking coat.  I don't like the coat. 
[03:46:00]  Now, this lovely young lady here is wearing some type of outerwear, but at least it's a  sexy coat.  Yes.  Thank you.  It's an inviting, I am chilly, but I'm still in the fucking character coat.  Yes.  Exactly.  She put on fucking Spanky from the fucking Our Gang coat, came in here with this...  Everybody here, look at this girl.  No, she can't stop smiling.  She's a trooper.  Put a surgery smile on.  She's a sexy bitch.  And we call her a good ass.  She is...  But the one in the back...  She's playing the role.  She stood in the back.  You are one of the most misogynistic, women-hating, sons of bitches... 
[03:46:30]  Let's talk about...  Let's talk about why you hate women.  Wait, Patrice...  I'll tell you shit.  You hate women.  We know.  I'm with Patrice, though.  No.  You called her out on it.  Nope.  And that's why she left, because if people...  If she was being righteous, she wouldn't have left.  She'd be like, oh, no, she wouldn't have left.  Go talk to the girl.  You said the C word, and that's bad.  Hold on.  You jumped to conclusions.  All right.  I forgot.  Let me explain something to her.  Wait.  We're going to talk to her.  Let me explain something to life real quick that people don't know.  Huh?  Cunt is the bitch for black girl.  You call a black girl a bitch, it gets the same reaction if you call a white girl a cunt. 
[03:47:00]  Now, cunt to a black girl is not that offensive, but cunt to a white girl.  All right.  That's the biggest word.  That's the A-bomb.  I was saying it, because I call my girl a cunt sometimes, but if she's black, so it doesn't  fuck with her like that.  So I didn't mean to make her go, ooh, because you call me a cunt.  But I wanted to let her know that I can smell her vibe, and that you came in and you're  always playing good cop for her horse shit.  No.  You're absolutely positively wrong.  I don't see that at all.  E-Rock.  Wait, what happened?  I see you as a woman-hating man who had a pick on one of these beautiful girls. 
[03:47:30]  I like that.  Yeah.  I see that too.  Hold on.  We got E-Rock back in the studio.  You might be right.  You might be right.  We were trying to get her word on this whole thing, because you chased her out of the studio.  Yeah.  E-Rock went outside the studio, and what happened?  She's going to come back, and you're going to make it up to her.  I'm not going to.  No.  She left.  I feel it.  I feel her.  She left.  She walked out.  Oh, Jesus.  She wanted nothing to do with this, and walked out.  And she wanted nothing to do with it in the fucking first place.  Nigga.  I don't tell her.  I know shit like that.  She didn't want to come in here.  Tell the truth, Benita. 
[03:48:00]  Tell the motherfucking truth.  Oh, man.  I gave her an excuse to fucking leave.  Benita's like, damn, now I've got to replace a girl.  How am I going to find a hot girl in two weeks?  Oh, my God.  No, I'm just joking.  I'm just joking.  Just don't make me look like a complete dick.  No.  Someone get a phone and let's talk to this girl.  She's running out of the studio now.  I'm not going to talk.  No.  I don't think you're getting a comment.  I will say nothing else.  I'll sit there and shut my face.  Oh, great.  Let us pick up the pieces?  I'm saying, I'll defend myself, but I didn't want her to run out. 
[03:48:30]  But I'm saying that she, before she came in here, she didn't.  And I can tell, you can't see, isn't it?  Oh, really?  Criswell?  The great Preskin?  He's like telepathic.  You were with Criswell when she woke up.  No.  No.  The one with the sexy winter coat on, she keeps looking around with like, oops.  He caught her on her face.  No, I didn't.  Yes, she knows.  These girls, you know, regardless.  Wait, that one's laughing.  You got her. 
[03:49:00]  She's on your side.  The one in the tiny blue top's on your side, Patrice.  The only brunette, you chased her out.  Tell her it's coming out on the air.  I'm sorry for saying cunt to her.  I really am.  And you're also sorry for?  No, he sees himself as completely right.  I apologize for that.  Okay, look.  I didn't want her to run out.  You know, I could be abrasive.  Tell her I'm sorry.  Tell her I'm sorry.  I am sorry.  It's a bit much.  What do I need to do?  What do I need to do for her?  Hold on, Patrice. 
[03:49:30]  Okay.  But she didn't really want to be here, right?  No, of course.  We're excited.  Of course she does.  I don't want to be here.  13th City Tour, we're having a ball.  13th City Tour, and this is the one place she doesn't want to be, Patrice?  Come on.  We were totally excited about being here.  We love New York.  She's just a nice person that kind of keeps to herself, and she doesn't run her mouth  randomly.  This is what you're obsessed with.  These girls.  You just sounded like a dodge trying to start.  I just don't want to be like, because it was unfounded.  Are you going to admit that she's beautiful? 
[03:50:00]  She was fucking sexy.  What do you want?  I mean, that wasn't the point.  It was attitude.  It was one of these things.  It's not like the other.  You are a big bully.  No, you don't want.  I just came off like a big bully guy.  I applaud Patrice, though.  People need to come in here and want to have fun.  She wasn't in here long enough to even see.  She said not one word.  Not a word.  This is you.  On her back.  Right.  And another thing, though, for real, really.  On her back. 
[03:50:30]  Body language.  I just feel cool.  Yeah, you were feeling it.  Usually, I'm a professional at walking people out of comedy shows, and usually, if the person  has been walked, if their friends don't walk with them, there's a slight bit of truth to  us till dawn.  Have you ever seen Quentin Tarantino's character?  Yeah, yeah.  And, like, when a woman was around him, how he fantasized and, like, thought he heard  her say things and meant things.  That's you.  No.  You were two seconds away from the guy leaving the room.  One guy, and you hacking her up into pieces on the bed. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, no, man.  You are a psychopath.  No.  It's like, she was lovely.  All right.  Well, we lost her.  We got three lovely blondes still in the studio.  They're all beautiful.  Well, hopefully, we'll have three by the time this ends.  And the girl outside.  Let's petrice once insult somebody else.  I don't want to.  The girl outside.  You mean the girl that's out in the street?  No, not that bitch.  The, uh, the, your sister.  That's your sister?  No.  I said the sister.  The sister?  What does she do?  Sister and sister.  She's a part of our PR firm.  I love them.  I love all of them.  She was gorgeous.  She'll be the one that gives a full report. 
[03:51:30]  Back to, you know, their people.  And tell them all about you.  Yeah.  So you girls are cheerleaders.  You guys rock.  Do you play?  Secret weapons, yeah.  Do you get out there and knock it around a little bit?  What do you play in?  Do you play in the same, like, cheerleader uniform?  No.  No?  We are brought out on the field.  We're going to play in this and then the little shorts.  In that?  I see, because you got numbers on your little, hot little tops.  And I'm wearing the cheerleader outfit.  And you got the cheerleader outfit on.  We're representing both sides.  Yes, you are. 
[03:52:00]  Very good.  See?  I found nothing wrong with the other girl, with these girls.  Yeah, I thought we could loosen her up a little bit.  It would have been nice, like, you know, I like brunettes.  It would have been nice to have a brunette in here.  Not that, you know, the blondes aren't beautiful.  But he chased the only brunette out of the whole goddamn building.  I know.  Chased her out of Manhattan.  You big, you King Kong motherfucker.  You terrorizing Manhattan, huh?  Call me a big black, uh, call me anything you want.  Go ahead.  You can, go ahead.  Go ahead, ladies.  Get it out.  You King Kong motherfucker. 
[03:52:30]  Wait, I still don't know what this lingerie bowl's about.  Obviously, there's the hotness factor, but then what?  Yeah.  It's girls playing football.  There's hot women playing football.  And lingerie.  Most importantly, there's cheerleaders.  Lingerie.  Oh, Jenny McCarthy's hosting.  Dennis Rodman is the commissioner.  The commissioner.  There's a lot of celebrities involved.  Yeah.  You ever see, it's great, the, uh, the snap.  When they, uh, hike the ball.  Yeah.  The girl bends over.  That's very nice.  And the girl between her legs like that.  Very sexual.  Are there going to be any, uh, oopsies? 
[03:53:00]  Pretty much.  Will there be any?  There are oopsies, yes.  There are oopsies?  Yeah.  Some hair might be cold.  Any record setting for rushing or passing yardage or, uh, field goal, uh.  The record's, uh, broken like that, no?  Who's the lady in charge?  What's, what's your name?  Benita.  You need to sell this better.  The guys out there need to know that there's going to be oopsies.  There are oopsies.  There's a possibility.  Who cares about the football, but all of a sudden, like.  That's the best you this morning.  All of a sudden, there's always a possibility of oopsies. 
[03:53:30]  You ever see, uh, in pro football where a guy, maybe the shirt gets pulled and the  shoulder pad pops out?  Yeah.  Think that.  Think that?  Will that happen?  Anything can happen.  Anything can happen.  Waldrope.  Oh, Waldrope.  Uh.  Anything can happen.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  Write a letter right now.  Are you penning a little note, dear?  He's got a good heart.  Wait, you're making him apologize?  It's a big teddy bear with a good heart.  What's her name?  He can admit when he has made a mistake and that's what he's currently doing. 
[03:54:00]  Is that a picture of her?  Sorry.  And I'm feeling a great deal of pride.  Yeah.  So sorry.  Where did you get that picture of me?  I've seen him be such a big teddy bear sweetheart.  Yeah, look at that.  And I've seen him just be a despicable human being.  Some people have those extremes.  Yes.  And we've seen one extreme and now we're seeing another.  I'm impressed right now.  Keep writing.  The C word and pre-judging you.  Boy. 
[03:54:30]  You pre-judged her.  I was wrong.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Patrice O'Neal.  I like that picture.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  I don't even know what to say other than wow.  There you go.  I'm wowed by you right now.  Wow.  I just wrote Daniel.  Danielle, I am sorry.  So sorry for calling you the C word.  And boy, I was wrong.  And then, Danielle, she let herself go.  She let herself go. 
[03:55:00]  There you go.  That's all you can do is try to make your wrongs.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Will Patrice called her the C word.  You guys, thank you so much for having us on your show.  You guys need more questions?  How many hotties on either side?  Standard football rules?  Yes, sir.  All right.  It's seven on seven.  Seven on seven.  Seven on seven.  What about the nails?  The girl's going to break the nails?  How are they going to protect their fine nails?  I'm looking. 
[03:55:30]  You can't go by me.  I'm a cheerleader.  I'm not playing at all.  I have the real things.  When you're playing contact football, it's not about the nails.  You're out there.  It's about the sport.  No, it's about the oopsies.  And this is going to be tackling.  Tackling.  Full on contact.  What do you wear on your legs?  Is it going to be...  Knee pads.  What do you got on under there?  I see matching some...  Jesus Christ.  These are like little boy shorts.  They are little boy shorts, indeed.  Indeed, they are.  Can we see an oopsie? 
[03:56:00]  That's wonderful.  Knee pads.  It's very sexy.  All right.  All right, girls.  That's wonderful.  They got to go?  All right.  All right, ladies.  I'm sorry.  Thank you for coming in.  You should be in this, by the way.  We appreciate having you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Sorry we got off on the wrong foot there.  Yeah, the wrong foot.  The wrong foot.  But the foot was in balance, so...  Give him a tongue lashing.  Give him a tongue lashing.  Well, we...  Bodog.net, everybody.  Go visit Bodog.net. 
[03:56:30]  We'll be praising him as soon as you leave the studio.  Give you a tongue lashing.  Thank you, ladies.  And there they go.  There they go.  The girls in the lingerie mall.  I want to get this out of the way right now.  Holy...  I bow to Patrice today.  Are you doing the...  I absolutely bow to you, my friend.  You're doing the slow clap.  I bow to you.  You saw something, and you went for it.  I haven't seen that vicious an attack that quickly. 
[03:57:00]  He was like...  You ever hear about the attacks where someone's standing there, and a pit bull, who's all happy  and wagging its tail, just lunges at someone's throat that's in the room?  That's what that reminded me of.  You can't see it, dude.  It's like, I'm not...  Like, you can go to Kreskin, but it's like, I just...  It's just...  You can feel that run through.  Yeah.  And it's just like, you can't feel that comfortable being that just...  Because she did look good, but you can't feel comfortable coming here, changing the 
[03:57:30]  mood of...  Because you know what?  Wow.  She was listening to us for an hour, being completely juvenile, and she just could...  She just was like...  So you're saying...  Yucky.  You are either the nastiest, or the most insightful person I've ever seen.  I just...  No.  You didn't see that?  No.  I am so with Patrice on this.  I didn't even see it.  As soon as she walked in with a winter coat, that was such a sign it wasn't even funny.  Like Patrice said, the other girl had kind of a coat on, but it was still sexy and had  something to do with the lingerie action. 
[03:58:00]  I didn't notice.  That girl had a winter coat like she was ready to go down the slope.  You know, you could be right, but I didn't even notice.  And she pretty much had her arms folded.  She did not want to be in that situation.  And the reason why we don't have a lot of women on the show lately is because of women  just like her.  Where they're like, ugh.  They just want to go through the motions.  Absolutely.  Wow.  The rest of the girls were lovely.  I liked them.  They played the role.  They were having fun.  Bye.  I didn't say anything to... 
[03:58:30]  It's like, you can feel it.  You're just surprised, Anthony, because he jumped on her so quickly.  No, because I didn't notice.  Usually we will kind of like, you know...  We would have had to have talked to her a little bit.  And then we would have been...  Dude.  Because we've been in that situation.  And you talk to him a little while, and then you go, all right, this chick just ain't  into it.  But you were like...  No, no.  I saw some frigging brainwaves.  No, I saw it, too.  I saw it, too.  And when I was thinking to myself, like, here we go again, and I'm going to have to do  a little Evil Opie. 
[03:59:00]  I swear to God.  But I thought it was going to be 10 or 15 minutes in where I finally would call her  out or something.  Evil Opie is Jesus compared to the monster we saw.  I understand.  That's what made it great.  And look at me, man.  I swear to you.  It's just...  It's like the comfort zone to bring it down.  It's just...  You know, she needed that.  It was a little medicine.  It didn't taste right.  You know, she'll feel better later, because she won't do that again.  Are they gone? 
[03:59:30]  Sort of.  Are they out of earshot?  Sort of.  I think Patrice needs to run out there and give the one girl a little camo.  Camo.  I'm getting all thumbs up.  Camo.  I tell her.  I tell her.  I tell her.  Oh, okay.  The audio's off.  Look, let me say this, then.  Patrice, that was fan-fucking-tastic.  Look, someone has to play good cop in order to keep anyone in the room.  But, oh my God, when you unloaded on her, I was laughing my ass off inside.  God bless you, Patrice O'Neal. 
[04:00:00]  Oh my God.  She was an 11, by the way.  It's like you come here, and you're just free.  Your mouth is free.  Well, that's good.  And if you go on a regular radio, you just go, oh, shit, how do I do this again?  Patrice, don't ever lose that.  I'll kill you.  Patrice, do you realize this also?  Do you realize, probably, when you first came on this very show, and I'm not talking about  any W, I'm talking about our XM show, that she was probably in high school? 
[04:00:30]  Like, that was a baby girl.  It's just...  That was a little baby girl.  I don't hate...  It's like, I hate the entitlement that she felt to be how she was.  She can't even go across the street and get a drink to feel better.  She's not old enough.  But she thinks that that makes her somebody because...  But you know what?  Bravo.  I say the same thing that every guy says to her in the street.  They say to 40 other women in the next block, and she has to learn how to be a little bit 
[04:01:00]  bigger than how cute she is.  A little thicker skinned.  Do you understand?  Just better.  You know what you did?  She left because she felt entitled.  She didn't want to be here.  You felt it.  You put the first wrinkle on her face.  She's been a kid, loved, like, just looked at and appreciated, never had a bad thing said.  She, like, scowled.  And you put that first wrinkle in her face.  The first wrinkle!  On that 20-year-old face.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[04:01:30]  You know?  You don't apologize.  It just was...  I don't know.  That was fine.  She's starting to realize that her hotness isn't going to get her through life.  It's life.  It's life.  You gave her a life lesson.  That's right.  There you go.  Thank you.  You're an asshole.  I know.  Oh, it gets worse.  More of the worst of Opie and Anthony presents ONA's Most Uncomfortable Interviews.  Coming up.  Moments so awkward, you can almost hear the perspiration.  The worst of Opie and Anthony presents ONA's Most Uncomfortable Interviews. 
[04:02:00]  Continues.  It's Opie and Anthony's Most Uncomfortable Interviews show.  How fantastic is that?  I am Iraki Asam.  Yeah, yeah.  And we're just playing a lot of stuff that will fit appropriately.  For time.  That's not the case, Eric.  Oh, but it's also interesting.  We're playing some of the most...  According to this disclaimer.  Listen, we're playing some of the most uncomfortable interviews in Opie and Anthony history.  Eric.  Yes.  You remember that guy, Richard Jenny?  He's dead.  Before he killed himself.  We didn't do it.  Well, that can't be confirmed. 
[04:02:30]  Because he's on this special.  He stopped by the old XM Studios.  You're leaving yourself open to be an accessory if you say that.  Oh.  Well, I wasn't there.  I wasn't there.  Me neither.  Well, you were.  We're covered.  No, I really wasn't there.  And he was outside our old studio when we used to have like bullpen type glass.  We saw him out there and he wanted to come in, but Opie and Anthony weren't really feeling  the interview at the time.  No, he wanted to come in like most comics do to promote their project. 
[04:03:00]  He was doing shows in New York.  He wanted to come in the studio like most people do who are invited to come into the studio.  Well, O and A aren't sure that he was really invited.  So, they decided to conduct the interview prison style.  Yeah, they made him stand on the outside of the glass and make them laugh.  It's Richard Jenney on the Opie and Anthony's show's most uncomfortable interviews.  Is this what offed him?  It could have been. 
[04:03:30]  O and A's most uncomfortable interviews.  Get him on the phone.  Richard Jenney's a comedian.  Called up yesterday.  Yes, he did.  At the end of the show.  Wanted to come in.  Mm-hmm.  Plug his show.  Caroline's.  And for some reason, he kept getting disconnected.  Right.  And we invited him to come in today.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello.  Who's this?  This is Richard Jenney.  Who's this?  Richard Jenney.  Hey, Richard, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[04:04:00]  How are you?  Opie and Anthony, how are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good.  I'm just peachy, thanks.  When are you coming in?  I was thinking about coming in today.  Today?  Yeah.  At what time?  Probably about 4.40.  4.40?  It's what, 4.22?  Yeah, I'm really close by.  Where are you?  I'm actually staying in the lobby.  You're outside the studio?  Yeah, I've been staying in the lobby.  I didn't want to miss you guys. 
[04:04:30]  And you want to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  If it's okay, if you're not too busy talking about Ron Jeremy's penis, I could maybe stop in.  Well, Ron's coming in, too.  You get along with him?  Yeah, you said yesterday, right?  Yes.  I've met him before.  In fact, I used to do jokes about him in my head.  Oh, you did?  I used to do a joke about big hairy fat guys with hair on their back getting all kinds  of chicks, and he came up to me.  I did the porno awards.  That's how I met him.  Oh, really?  I had a bit in there about fat hairy guys getting all kinds of women. 
[04:05:00]  He comes up to me and he goes, you were talking about me, weren't you?  And I go, no, I was just a generic fat porno hairy guy.  It wasn't really you.  When you tell that joke on stage, do you get a laugh?  That wasn't actually the porno joke.  It was just telling a story.  Oh, I thought you said that's something you do in your act.  You want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  Well, that's where you're on the phone like you are now, and then you step up to the glass  on the door to the studio.  Right.  And you talk that way. 
[04:05:30]  No, I'm not doing that.  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  You ever watch Oz?  Why can't I just come in?  I can't just come in the studio.  Are you worried about germs or something?  We're going to have Ron Jeremy in.  That was really funny.  That thing yesterday was really funny.  What thing?  The thing where you kept hanging up on me.  Oh, yeah.  It would be funny if we hung up on you right now.  No, I think it gets old.  It gets old after a while.  Yeah, it does. 
[04:06:00]  This is our new game.  You're 15 feet away, and we're making you call us on the telephone.  At first, I was pissed off, and then I just started cracking up.  It was so juvenile.  Were you really mad?  At first, I was.  What the hell was that?  How could they do it?  And then I just go, that is just so asinine.  I have to laugh at it.  But if you're going to get mad at something like that, maybe you shouldn't be on our show,  because we're juvenile.  That's true.  You know?  Well, it's up to you.  I was hoping you'd put me on.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny. 
[04:06:30]  Well, I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure on you or anything.  I'll be funny.  What's the first joke you're going to tell on the air?  Stop it.  You've been totally putting him on the spot here.  Do you have a riff on, like, Clinton or anything?  Clinton.  Any riffs on things in the news?  There's lots of riffs on whatever you want to talk about.  Yeah?  But I've got to be in the studio to do them.  I'm not funny in the lobby.  Yeah.  Do you have any knock-knock jokes?  I don't know. 
[04:07:00]  I don't know.  He's laughing at the juvenile stuff again.  Knock-knock.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Uh-oh.  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny who?  Richard Jenny, you're hearing knock-knock because I'm pistol-whipping Opie and Anthony.  Get it, Richard Jenny who?  Oh, sorry. 
[04:07:30]  All right, Richard.  Can you give us a few minutes to think about it?  Yeah, think it over.  Hope you are just the worst host ever.  All right, hold on, Richard.  Someone wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Paul.  What's up, boys?  You're on the air with Richard Jenny, who's right outside the studio on a phone.  Do yourself a huge favor and leave him where he is.  Why?  Why?  He was on Ron and Fez yesterday and I felt like sticking a steak knife in my forehead. 
[04:08:00]  Oh, Richard?  He was more boring than church.  Richard, did you have a good time on Ron and Fez yesterday?  Yeah, I did, but actually I feel like sticking a steak knife in his forehead, too.  Oh, he was horrendous.  He was horrendous.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  That's not nice, Paul.  Richard Jenny came all this way.  He's in the lobby, outside the studio.  Right, Richard?  In the lobby.  Not for much longer.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[04:08:30]  What does that mean?  Wait a minute, Richard.  I thought you know how to have fun and stuff.  Come on.  You're wearing me out with this crap.  We're just having fun and hanging.  All right.  All right.  You're not having fun with this?  It's funny for like a minute.  Yeah, but you know, some things are funny, right?  And then they get unfunny, and then the longer they go on, it comes right back around and  gets funny again.  Yeah, I guess.  We're waiting for it to get to that point again.  All right.  It's really not there yet. 
[04:09:00]  We'll have a long wait.  Richard, do you know what our show's about?  You ever hear our show?  What have you heard about the Opie and Anthony show, Richard?  Nothing.  Not much?  Nothing?  No.  Are you from New York, or where are you from?  Originally from New York, yeah.  And where you live in L.A. now?  Yeah.  So you're not familiar with this show?  No, but it's so popular.  So this could be like Commonplace, and you wouldn't know it.  We might do this to every guest we've ever had. 
[04:09:30]  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  What?  You thought this wasn't on the air?  No, I thought we were just talking.  We are.  It's a talk show, kind of.  All right.  I'm going to hang it up.  All right.  What?  Hello?  Why did he hang up?  Did he hang up?  What's going on?  Go see how that went.  He's right outside the door. 
[04:10:00]  What's the matter?  I thought we were having fun.  Why is everyone coming in here?  Go smooth things over.  No, we're going to go to the listeners, see if they want Richard Jenny on the show.  There he is.  He looks like he's going to kill us.  Richard Jenny.  Come here.  Sit down, man.  Are you doing this or not?  Oh, no.  Come on.  It's all fun.  Richard Jenny.  How are you?  Aren't you a good sport, Richard?  That's Opie over there.  I'm Anthony.  Uh-oh.  He looks all uptight.  What's the matter?  You spent too much time. 
[04:10:30]  You're wasting time, right?  It's like a waste of time.  See, now you've got to be funny.  No.  After we just pissed you off.  He looks all pissed.  Here, get on the mic.  Just let's see how much we can screw with Richard.  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  Forget it.  No, no, no.  Opie.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  Forget it.  Richard, let me explain something. 
[04:11:00]  Look at two little babies.  He's going to conform to our show.  Don't say...  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to be more funny.  Don't say two, because Opie is...  Press button, you big loser.  Pressing button.  Be more funny.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us, and we can't take it.  I was listening, and Opie is a prick.  You don't have a sense of humor?  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah, we're on the air.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  We got a machine.  No, thanks.  Look what it did to you.  I know.  Would you like a beer or something to listen up? 
[04:11:30]  No, I don't need a beer.  No?  No, I'm fine.  It's not about meeting it.  It's just, you know, you want to hang out.  Yeah, no, I don't drink.  You don't drink anymore?  I never started.  You didn't?  No.  You've never had a beer in your life?  I had a couple.  I've had beers.  I just never got a taste for it.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Michael feels bad, too, now.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Listen, Richard, you're a real radio whore, aren't you?  Well, me and your mom.  How many shows are you going to be on, man?  I mean, come on. 
[04:12:00]  What's the problem?  What other shows would be on radio shows?  He's not funny.  He's, like, miserable.  He can't even go with the flow.  I mean, you know.  Well, we busted his balls the last two days.  Well, I mean, that's what comedians are all about.  But I really like you anyway, man.  You're a good guy.  Thank you.  I don't care.  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  Brian, what's going on?  Richard, I was thinking, just thinking back to some time when I was watching the UPN Network  and your brilliant sitcom Platypus Man.  Right. 
[04:12:30]  Oh, that's great.  You were on that?  It sucked.  It did suck.  Well, finally somebody is.  All right.  I'll take that one.  It did suck.  Come on.  It was a bad show.  Did you see that, man?  No.  How big an idiot are you for watching it, though?  What do you have going on in your life that you were watching a show that bad?  Come on.  Stick a knife in your forehead.  Where are you from originally?  New York City.  New York City.  Brooklyn, New York.  Brooklyn.  And you never made it out to the island when you were living here?  Yeah, I did.  But it was crappy then.  Right.  Governors was a crappy club then.  Now it's gotten a lot better.  Now it's great. 
[04:13:00]  Well, the beaches you went to out there, right?  Yes.  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  Forget it.  Oh, Pete.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  I get it.  Richard, let me explain something.  Look at two little babies.  I mean, he's going to conform to our show.  Don't say...  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to be more funny.  Don't say two, because Opie is...  Press button, you big loser.  Pressing buttons.  Be more funny.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us, and we can't take it.  I was listening, and Opie is a prick to guess. 
[04:13:30]  You don't have a sense of humor?  Can you say prick on the radio?  Yeah.  We can say prick, sure.  They keep changing it.  Really?  Yeah, you just can't use it in the context of a unit.  Right.  Like, I have a big...  Yeah, you could call someone a prick.  You could say, don't be a prick.  Okay.  So you can't say, I grabbed his...  Glenn.  And then use the word.  Glenn, what's up?  Oh, man.  You guys got to cut Richard Jennings a break.  We are.  First of all, the hanging up yesterday, and then having to wait out in the lobby.  Oh, I haven't whacked this heart since Gary Coleman.  See, Nancy from Jersey.  Opie, you are such a rude, unfunny a-hole. 
[04:14:00]  See?  See?  You're being bad to Richard.  See that?  All right.  People are mad at you.  All right, what were you going to say?  I wasn't going to say anything.  I'll be quiet now.  We'll do it your way.  I'll be quiet.  We'll do it your way.  You're a big shot radio guy.  Let's not let him be funny on our show.  We're the funny ones.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We only bring in the comedians to abuse them.  Don't say we.  I was being nice.  I want to sit here.  I'm listening to what you're saying.  And we allow...  He's being a jackal.  We allow a lot of people to be funny on our show.  Yeah.  See, you didn't do your research.  We allow them to be funny. 
[04:14:30]  Well, you know what I mean.  We allow them to be funny.  This is now officially turning uncomfortable for me.  We have this show, and people come in, and they're funny, and we don't care.  All right, okay.  All right?  So what were you going to say?  I forgot.  What were you going to say?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  What were you talking about, Ed?  I don't remember.  I don't remember either.  You're being rude.  It was something about Long Island, right?  Yeah.  And governors.  Yeah.  And then you were going to say something.  I don't want to talk about this.  Let's do whatever it is you do.  We don't do anything, Richard.  This is what we do. 
[04:15:00]  We just sit here and do nothing for four hours a day.  We goof on people and make them feel uncomfortable.  That's our gig.  We have to abuse the comics.  No.  All right.  We're trying to get on that.  We love the comics.  We've had a lot of comics on here.  We had Jay in there yesterday.  We had Jay.  We have Norton comes in all the time.  We've had Andrew Dice Clay in here.  Ron Jeremy's coming in a little while.  He's not a comic.  He's pretty funny.  He wanted to be a comic at one point.  He's got some comics.  Have you ever watched some of those movies?  You watch his movies?  Yeah.  I've seen a couple.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[04:15:30]  I've seen those back in his heyday.  Yeah.  He's great.  He's quite the guy.  He's...  I like...  I...  You know, people think that...  We should say this on the air.  That people...  This is a misconception that people have that men like porno, which is false.  It's men's penises that like porno.  Right.  So, like, any guy, no matter how stupid he is, he's going, this movie sucks.  It has a bad plot, to any people.  But the penis is going, it's genius.  It speaks to me.  I haven't seen performances like these in years.  I must have it for my collection.  So, I like Ron Jeremy.  He's a big, disgusting character. 
[04:16:00]  Uh-oh.  Some people call him a hedgehog.  I got a porno dish, a satellite dish that plays porno 24 hours a day.  Yeah?  Plays other things, too.  You like your porno?  You got a steady?  You got a steady gal?  You're never disappointed.  You never sit there going, gee, I didn't think it would end that way.  It was really good, right up until then.  Up until the money shot.  The plot just fell apart.  What the hell happened there?  What's your act like?  I'm really, I haven't seen your stand-up.  It's, uh, you know, what can I say?  It's your act.  You stand there, you talk. 
[04:16:30]  This has been the worst of Opie and Anthony Presents.  ONA's most uncomfortable interviews.  For more uncomfortable interviews, listen to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Every weekday, here on The Virus.  Because this kind of thing happens way more often than it should. </pre>
