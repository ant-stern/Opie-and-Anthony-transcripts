<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous, repetitive song dedicated to their "Tuesday Night Hummer Club," a segment encouraging oral sex.  Listener calls and faxes further fueled the Hummer Club theme, with one listener, Evelyn, urging her boyfriend, Dennis, to leave work early for an induction. Opie shared a childhood crush on Nadia Konich, sparked by a colleague's photo.  Scheduled guest Stephen Lynch was expected to debut a new Hummer Club song later in the show.

A substantial portion of the show debated a new city law confiscating cars from drunk drivers.  The hosts expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, contrasting it with the repeated drunk driving offenses of Francisco Almonte, whose story was featured in the Daily News. They discussed the possibility of a "drunk driver's license" graded by alcohol tolerance.  A drunk driver, Arthur, was interviewed, resulting in a rambling, humorous conversation.

The hosts reminisced about their youth, recounting reckless driving and juvenile pranks like destroying mailboxes and garbage cans.  A caller, John, suggested using breathalyzers for self-regulation.  The discussion veered into professional wrestling, specifically "Inferno Matches," and hilariously absurd hypothetical wrestling scenarios involving anal rape and fisting.  Rosie O'Donnell's weight gain and an unexpected studio visit from Old Dirty Bastard (ODB), who proceeded to drink several 40-ounce beers, were also discussed.  Stephen Lynch then performed his new Hummer Club song, a lengthy comedic piece.

The show continued with further discussion and jokes about Stephen Lynch's song "Peep Show Girl," which was played multiple times. A lengthy anecdote followed about the hosts' and a friend's experiences at a peep show ("Peep Land"), detailing their interactions with performers, including attempts to touch them and the payment system. The hosts recounted the establishment's rebranding as a Kung Fu film festival to avoid legal trouble.

The conversation became sexually charged, focusing on the hosts', Stephen Lynch's, and ODB's past sexual experiences and fantasies, mentioning celebrities like Nadia Comaneci, Marsha Brady, and Florida from *Good Times*.  Crude humor and offensive language were prevalent.  The hosts also discussed their financial success in radio and gave several shout-outs.  The show concluded with Stephen Lynch performing his song "Lullaby," a darkly humorous song about divorce and a father's questionable behavior.  Finally, the hosts discussed comedian Chris Burke, gifting him a copy of his album and playing a track, sparking further crude humor and discussion of Burke's career.

I'm Rybrook  Just had a chance to check out the new Tara pics  Must say, much, much, much better  Also, it looks like the photographer must have been practicing  That's Anthony  Well, I took the pictures, but I did have a different camera  All right  And, of course, the fax line is 212-957-WNAW  Two for Tuesday with Soundgarden on 1027-WNAW  Burden in my hand and Spoonman before that  It's Opie and Anthony  And the faxes are coming in for the club, Anthony 
[00:03:30]  Already?  Oh, this one's great  From Evelyn  Referring to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  Please mention to Dennis working in Manhasset  To get his ass out of work early if he wants to be inducted tonight  Ooh  You guys rule, butt plug forever  Uh, butt plug?  Uh, butt plug  Dennis, leave work now  What, are you kidding me?  Man  Evelyn, if you're listening, you've got to call up  We want to talk to you on the air  I didn't want to call you at work and embarrass you  You know, you might want to cross out your work number  Next time you send a fax like this  Oh, yeah, watch that 
[00:04:00]  With the company name and everything, you know  But Evelyn, if you want to talk to us, give us a call, alright?  Alright  Tuesday Hummer Club underway  Yes  Steven Lynch on his way in at 5 o'clock today  Got a new song  And, uh, there he is  There's the loser  You knew they'd put the guy's face on the front page of the paper today  Driver number one  Snared in the Dewey Dragnet  Uh-huh  And had his car taken away  Francisco  But it was a  Almonte  But it was a beater, man  1987, uh, Toyota, right? 
[00:04:30]  Is that the one he had?  Yeah  Hmm  Yeah, there it is, yep  1987, Toyota  Oh, what a surprise  He had a drinking car  Yeah  You know, Anthony started the drinking, uh, car thing yesterday  Yeah  And I guess people enjoyed, uh, Anthony's concept so much that they used it on their own show today  That's okay  In the morning  I appreciate it  Appreciate the props  Yeah, I was saying, um, obviously, you get yourself a crap mobile  Uh-huh 
[00:05:00]  Your drunk mobile  Uh-huh  And, uh, minimal insurance  And you have your friends use it  Yep  When they want to go out  And it's the drunk car  If it gets taken away, you're like, oh, well, there you go  Gee  I could get another one of these  But Francisco Almonte  This guy's a winner  The first motorist nabbed in the city's new campaign to seize cars of drunken drivers  Has been arrested eight times before on charges he got behind the wheel while intoxicated  Eight times?  Eight times  Phew  Though, uh, Almonte, 47, was convicted or pleaded guilty 
[00:05:30]  Five of the eight times he was arrested  He had a valid license Sunday when they arrested him again for drinking and driving  Now, how do you get your license back after, uh, being charged with Dewey that much?  Eight times  That many times  Well, this is, uh, what we were talking about yesterday  It's like, we think this whole law is a real stupid idea  Stupid  If the mayor really wants to crack down on drunk driving  Why is a guy that, uh, was convicted five out of eight times driving drunk  Why does that guy have a license to begin with? 
[00:06:00]  Exactly  Do you honestly think this guy, when he gets out of jail or wherever he is, he probably just got a slap on the wrist  You don't think he's going to get behind another car?  Well, behind the car wouldn't be bad  Behind the wheel?  That's another story  Behind the car, whatever, right  Well, you'll get behind the car and someone will back over him  Yeah, well, he's so drunk he might just get behind the car  You know what I'm saying, though?  This guy's not going to stop doing this  So what did we prove by taking the car away from him?  Hmm  And then they arrested another guy 
[00:06:30]  Because there's a whole bunch of people in the paper today  Yeah  Another guy that, uh, had his license suspended 22 times?  Oh  20  How does that happen?  22?  Man  Honestly, like, okay, your license has been suspended  Let's give you 10 times  Maybe after that it's time to just not give you a license ever, ever again  How do you get it suspended 22 times?  I don't know  Wow  22  22 times?  There's a very simple way to stay out of this problem for you 
[00:07:00]  And your family and anyone else  Do not drink and get behind the wheel of a car, Giuliani said  Just don't do it  Well, that's easy for someone who gets limo'd around everywhere  Yeah  What a jack-off  What is he talking about?  Sometimes you go out, you go to the bar  You drink two beers and you're over the limit  Mm-hmm  You get pulled over, you're screwed  You can drive  And they're taking your brand new car away that, uh  They should have tough laws like this guy?  Forget about it  This many times?  Yeah  I'm for, uh, just take this guy's license away 
[00:07:30]  Mm-hmm  Give him some jail time  Whatever, whatever it takes  But when you're cruising around, you add a couple of beers  And you get pulled over and get popped  Now that's ridiculous  Of course it is  Totally  Of course it is  You shouldn't take your car away for that  But, uh, I guess  Giuliani  I guess we're gonna get one of the guys that got caught  And had his car taken away  We're gonna have him on the show a little later on  Are we?  Yeah, I think we're gonna talk to him within, uh  Let me look over there  About 40 minutes it looks like  Can I force you an opinion?  Half a page written  Half a page written  All right, go ahead, Ralph  I don't think it's 
[00:08:00]  What's up, Ralph?  I don't think it's a totally bad law  Uh-oh  I really don't  Why?  I just don't think, uh, the problem with it  I think the flaw is that it's after the first shot  I think everybody's allowed to make a mistake  Well  And it should be severe  And the license should get suspended and all that  Mm-hmm  But to take the car away immediately  That doesn't quite sit right with me  Well  The second time, maybe take the car  Well, uh, but the point I'm trying to make  A guy like the guy on the front page of the Daily News 
[00:08:30]  That guy is  It didn't deter  It didn't deter this guy  He's going to go and drink again  If he can get his, uh, hands on another, uh, vehicle  And first of all  Any type of  The real thing here  Is the seizure of personal property  Before a conviction  Which is  Come on  Mm-hmm  You can't do that  Right  The ACLU's got to jump on this one  I think it will  I think it was in the Post  Uh, they said  Where will the mayor stop?  You know, if you're caught jaywalking  Are they going to take your shoes away?  Uh, actually  We're going to be, uh, confiscating feet 
[00:09:00]  We have the police out there with hatchets  And if you are jaywalk  We're going to steal your feet  Too much  He's a rip, this guy  He drives around  He's limoed around everywhere  And he's saying  He goes to these functions where  Uh, you know  He's down in a couple  Mm-hmm  At these little political things  With all the drunk politicians  And they all hop in their  Chauffeur-driven limos  And they're, uh, car at home  Right  What about us people  That have to drive everywhere?  What about the average man? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah  What if you go  You go to, like, a friend's wedding  You drink at a wedding  Now you've got to drive home  I don't say  You get snotty drunk  And try to drive home  That's stupid  But after a few beers  Or a few drinks  And you're safe to drive  You can still get popped  Mm-hmm  By the law  You're not safe to drive, though  By the law  According to the law  You're not safe to drive  That's where my drunk driver's license comes in  You have  Motor vehicles set up a test  For people that want to drink and drive  They test you  After a certain 
[00:10:00]  Uh, a blood alcohol level  To see how good you are  Through a rigorous course  Not the stupid, dopey DMV course  That they give you  Every time you try to get a license  I mean, a real hard course  And you are rated  On your license  For a .1  Or a .13  Get out  Or a .2  That would be me  Or, or, or  Or some people would wash out  All a .03  He's serious  People handle alcohol differently  They're serious  Yes, of course they do  So the cop would give you a breathalyzer  All right, you blew a .09 
[00:10:30]  Mm-hmm  You know  You're, you're impaired  You're just below  Well, officer, look  I'm rated at a .12  Be on your way  You're free to go  He's serious  I like this idea  Anthony drove perfectly fine  After yesterday's show  When we were drinking the malt liquor  On our show  No problems  All the way home, right?  Some people's tolerance  Is higher than others  As far as alcohol is concerned  I don't think we should all be lumped  In the category  What about the, the skinny little chick  You used to see at the parties 
[00:11:00]  One glass of bubbly  And she's, uh, snotted  She's running around  Taking her clothes off  And then there's your, your big fat friend  Who could just drink all night long  Hefty keg  Why should the law be the same  For these two people  To hop behind a wheel?  Hmm?  Some people aren't good  Under the legal limit  They're bouncing off the walls  And they're, they're, I have a 05  Some people  You got a 1  And you're fine  Why should we all be judged the same?  Have a drunk driver's license  So maybe Mr. DWI number 1 
[00:11:30]  Had like a  No, he hit something  0.25  The reason they got him  Is he hit something  Yeah, obviously  But you're saying  If he had a 0.25 on his license  Well, no, this guy  Then the 8 time  8 priors would have  Probably  No, let me tell you something  This guy was  From his record  This guy was snotty  From his record  He would probably have a very low  Point of value  On his, on his drunk driver's license  And be getting pulled over anyway  And getting arrested  Because he's rated for a  0.05, let's say  And, and he's bouncing off of things  He's drunk all the time  He's getting pulled over 8 times 
[00:12:00]  Anthony, the sad part is  Is your rules aren't even in effect  And he got away with it 8 times  Right  Well, put my rules in effect  Anthony for, uh  For mayor  Yes  That's what you'd get  With Mayor Anthony  At the helm  No, this guy had a 0.19 though  The guy was snotted  A 1.9  We're talking about  Those fringe, those fringe people  I'm talking when you go out to a bar  You're gonna drink  And have to drive home  There was one in the article  That was kind of fringe  The second guy they nailed, I think  What is it? 
[00:12:30]  0.1 is, is the legal limit  Yeah  He was like 0.11  Hmm  Well, that's over  That's just over a little bit though, isn't it?  Yeah  And his car's gone  Gone  That's the law  Acura, goodbye  See, now maybe he could have been rated  At a 0.15  And been fine  Well, that's a little much  But until Mayor Anthony is in  You won't see such a law  And believe me  I'll bring the strip clubs back  Hey, you wanna talk to Evelyn real fast?  Bottomless  We have to 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, you're getting silly  Silly?  Bottomless?  Come on  Bring it back  Bring it back  That's right  You wanna talk to Evelyn real fast?  Yeah, sure  We started the break with Evelyn  Evelyn  Hi, guys  Hi, so you're gonna induct your husband tonight?  Boyfriend  Boyfriend  He's not a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  No, because he works too hard  Oh, man  You think he's listening to us right now?  Well, I know he is  Because I just beeped him to listen  All right, so why don't you talk to him through the radio now?  Go ahead  Dennis, get your ass out of work early tonight, hon 
[00:13:30]  What do you got in store for him?  Well, what do you think?  Well, I don't know  What's the move, though?  You're just gonna go for it?  Or are you just gonna kind of  I'm not just gonna jump down  Never mind  All right  Little din-din or something, or what?  Well, we'll see what happens  We'll see what time he gets home  If he gets home early  If he gets home late  Are you gonna dress all seductive for when he comes home?  Oh, I don't have to do that  Oh  I like this girl right to the point  So basically, if Dennis gets home early, he's gonna be in  Oh, definitely  Man, Dennis 
[00:14:00]  Without a doubt  It's a no-brainer  Yeah, you gotta leave  Dennis, you gotta leave  No-brainer  All right, Evelyn  Let us know if it happens  And call us tomorrow  I'll call you tomorrow, guys  All right, Evelyn  Anthony for governor  Yeah  You're welcome  All right, man  Bye-bye  I think a DJ's done that already in this town  You went from mayor to governor  Yeah, look at that  I'm just trying to get mayor  1027 WNEW  The Rock of New York  Two for Tuesday with Deep Purple  Love that song  Knock it out your back door  In space trucking

[00:15:00]  I'm all in favor of that drunk driving test  You know, whose idea was that?  Anthony  Yeah, you know  I got a problem with the government telling me  I can't drive my car after two beers  But they don't have a problem with every senior citizen  Driving around  Who has the reaction time of a turtle  How come it's only the old people's cars  That the accelerator sticks?  I don't know what happened  The accelerator stuck  I knew a guy who was an epileptic  And he still had his license

[00:25:00]  And we passed a side road  That a police car was parked in  And he came pulling right out after us  So I figured we can make this next right turn  And we'll just  He'll go right past  Oh sure  That never worked  Went to turn  The thing slid  Boom  Right into the curb  And the car is up on its side  And then bam  Comes back down  Shut the lights  And the cop went past  He didn't see you go over the curb?  No  So I was just like  Thank you God 
[00:25:30]  And that was it  After that  It was pretty much  You know  No more of those shenanigans  Yeah  Time to settle down  Yeah  You kind of learn  You know  And you think back  And you wonder how you ever made it  Without getting killed  Or arrested or something  Do you wake up some mornings and go  Huh  You just have a flashback  Of something really stupid and crazy  You did when you were younger  And now that you're more responsible  And stuff  And older  You just can't imagine  You ever said that  Yeah  You did it  You made it through  Oof  Some people don't  That's true  We got a guy on the line that 
[00:26:00]  I don't know  What is  He's got a breathalyzer thing he does  Alright  Because we're talking about  The new law that Giuliani  Enacted about taking away your car  These guys have a solution to the problem  Alright  Buddy what do you got  Hey what's up  It's John from Westchester  How you guys doing  Good  Hey John  I think Giuliani's new law is stupid  You think it's stupid  But until we have Mayor Anthony  I have a solution for you  What I do  And what my friends do  Is we bought a battery operator breathalyzer  Through one of these mail order catalogs  And we go out to the bar  We drink until we're at our absolute legal limit 
[00:26:30]  And as soon as it's just getting into the red zone  We hold off for about a half hour  And drive home  Now how many beers could you guys get in  Before you hit that limit  You'd be surprised  A trained professional like myself  I can get in a good six beers  And sell on my parents  A trained professional  I know now  At about five and a half  We start easing off a little bit  You know  Right right  And we go from there  Sometimes you know  We'll think we're drunk  We go out to the car  We test the breathalyzer  We see we're not  So we go back in for a couple of cups 
[00:27:00]  Yeah  Look at that  So I wonder  When are you guys coming up to Westchester?  We're definitely planning on it  Yeah sure  No I swear to God  The Yopi and Anthony on the road freak show  Continues all through our career here at N.E.W.  And we'll make it up there  I'll bring the breathalyzer  So we can all try it out  It has disposable ends  So we won't catch anything from each other  Very cool  Alright sounds good guys  I think our next party  I think we're doing some St. Paddy's Day  Right here in the city  Oh sounds good  I'll be there  And then maybe Westchester's the next stop  You never know 
[00:27:30]  You got a lot of fans up there  Cool man  Alright take it easy  Thank you  Speaking of that breathalyzer thing  I forgot what city I was living in  Because I've lived way too many places  I think it was Rochester  One of the bars had a breathalyzer  So you could check if you're drunk or not  But me and my friends  You know we took it to the limit  And we tried to figure out  Who would get the highest limit  On the breathalyzer  It becomes a game  It defeats the purpose  Doesn't it  It was a sick game  And I'm serious  Give me another shot man  I'll kick your ass  It was like every 20 minutes or so 
[00:28:00]  We'd all get on the breathalyzer  And see who's in the lead  Ugh  Oh it was just insane  Speaking of things you did when you were younger  And you wake up going  Oh my god I couldn't believe that  Horrible  That's one of the things we did  We were blowing 2-0  Oh stop  Swear to you man  Ugh  This show's about honesty  I swear to you  1027 WNEW  The rug of New York  Two for Tuesday  Days of the New  Shelf in the Room  And Touch Peel and Stan  From the debut CD  From the boys  From Kentucky  It's Opie and Anthony

[00:29:30]  This guy did a good job at this  We encourage our listeners  To send in their  Tuesday Night  Hummer Club songs  Of course  But before we play this song  We got to read Annie's  Instant feedback  From North Arlington  New Jersey  Annie writes  Hey guys  My husband and I  Are weekly members  Of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club  But he has a little fetish  This is bizarre  Every Tuesday  When I'm humming him  He has to have  The Flintstones on  What  Any suggestions  Without the Flintstones  He's not as excited  About getting it on 
[00:30:00]  Get out of here  Personally I think  He's got a thing  For Betty Rubble  Now Annie  If you're listening  Please give us a call  We got to talk to you  About your  Is that for real  Your husband's fetish  Hey Bonnie  Hey  He's looking at my wife  While he's getting a Hummer  That's a sick fetish  Hmm  Maybe I  Rock Quarry  Could get a Hummer  Wouldn't that be nice 
[00:30:30]  I'll get one from  Betty and Wilma  When I tell them  I'm not  Gus Schultz  Gas station worker  I miss  Holly Rock  I miss  The adulation  Of my fans  I miss  The Hummers  I used to get  As Rock Quarry  Yeah he had  Everyone fooled  Huh  Maybe you'll remember  Me from my film  The Dancing Playboy  Or this one 
[00:31:00]  Dr. Jekyll's Hyde  Ah  How the hell  Do you remember  This stuff  I loved that one  That was my favorite  Flintstones  When Rock Quarry  Comes to town  And he's fed up  With all of his fans  And he leaves  And works at the gas station  As Gus Schultz  And he's befriended  By Fred and Barney  So they take him home  And the girls freak out  But he convinces him  That he's really just  Gus Schultz  Then he gets sick  Of the boredom  This life  Is not for me 
[00:31:30]  I am a star  I miss the  Adulation  So he figures  I'll tell them  Who I really am  They will get  A big kick  Out of it  And he tells them  Guess what  I'm Rock Quarry  And they all laugh at him  Right  So he starts doing  His little scenes  In front of him  You might remember  This scene  From what was this  Cowboy picture  Pow  Pow  Pow  He's like  He's shooting  And Dr. Jickles  Hide  Ah  Yeah he messes  His hair up  Ah  The dancing playboy 
[00:32:00]  And then he gets pissed  And punches Fred  In the mouth  And then Fred  Throws him out  And they realize  When his agent  Drives by and goes  Rock  Rock baby  Where have you been  And they take him away  And they go  Oh he was Rock Quarry  Favorite Flintstone  Okay very good  Might be an opium  Anthony trivia question  In the future  Yeah we'll do it  This weekend  We'll give away  The Allman Brothers tickets  Ah  Alright  You might remember  This one  Alright here's the deal  Another Hummer song 
[00:32:30]  From our listeners  I love Hummers  One of our three listeners  Sent in a song  So that's pretty good odds  It was John right  I don't have his info anymore  We really laugh  At this damn thing  Bring it on home baby  1027 WNEW  The Rock in New York  Two for Tuesday  With ACDC  Whole lot of Rosie  And there sure is  A lot of Rosie

Have you ever watched it?  No  No  It's pretty ridiculous  Too white trash for you?  Too exciting for me  Okay  It's like crack though  The more you don't want to do it  You just find yourself sitting there watching USA  I wish I didn't have to do this 
[00:36:00]  Losing my family over it  Well Raw is War was on last night  Yeah we watched of course  And I don't know  A lot of hype went into the Inferno match  At the end of the show last night  You want to explain the Inferno match  To the people that don't watch wrestling  Well Opie they wrestle in the ring  But on the border  The outskirts of the ring  There's a fire  Coming out of this pipe  And gas jets  And whenever they slam someone down 
[00:36:30]  The flames get as high as the ropes  Correct  But for the most part  They're just kind of sitting there  Like a pilot light on an oven  And they kind of  Eh you know  They're kind of pushing  Eh  And what was the object of the Inferno match?  Well as Vince McMahon describes it  In all of his glory and eloquence  Kane and the Undertaker  Are going in the ring  In an Inferno match  The first man to come out  In flames is the loser 
[00:37:00]  Yeah  Yeah so if you're on fire you lose  They said somebody will be barbecuing  Yeah  Turns out  If you're squeamish  Yeah  Please leave the building  It turns out they had some of that fire gel  On Kane's foot  Yeah  And his foot was on fire  For about ten seconds  Yeah  But he lost  Ding ding ding  Oh my god  A lot of hype  Not much of a payoff  But it was cool  It doesn't make you miss  The Fuji days  With the dust  Oh man  When Fuji would throw the salt 
[00:37:30]  In the people's eyes  Right  My god  Don't the refs know  He's going to do that  Do you watch him  I mean he's coming  To the side of the ring  He's going to throw the salt  In the guy's eyes  Ref  Pat him down  For god's sake  Yeah  Everyone knows that  Who was the guy  With the broken thumb  For years  Ernie Ladd  Ernie Ladd  He's going to jab him  In the eye  With the thumb  Ernie Ladd  Had a thumb injury  For ten years  In WWF  Right  And he would gouge  And have people's eyes out  Yeah  Well D'Lo Brown 
[00:38:00]  Had the chest protector  On for two years  And he'd slam people  With that  Yeah he finally took that off  I noticed last night  Yes  I saw that  Now getting back to this  Inferno death match  They had last night  With the Flames  The WWF  It's becoming funny  Because they're just inventing  These new type of matches  Like  A ladder match  Like a ladder match  Yeah  And no matter what  Vince McMahon suggests  As a match  The wrestlers do it  Oh they'll buy it  You know  It gets ridiculous  I want 
[00:38:30]  Stone Cold  Steve Austin  And The Rock  At Wrestlemania 15  In an anal rape match  First person to be  Anally raped  Loses the match  What do you say guys  Let me tell you  Something Vince  I'm going to take  The Rock  And bend him over  And plow it home  And that's the bottom line  Because Stone Cold  Says so  Yeah that's what's

[00:56:00]  And then I watch you as you shake that ass  I watch you grind  I watch you dance  I show you mine  You show me yours  And when we're done  I button up my pants  And my friends all laugh  My friends all scoff  When I say I love a girl  I should take it off  But I tell them that they're crazy  Cause I've been around the world  And there's nothing wrong  Nothing  With my Peep Show 
[00:56:30]  Girl  No  No  There's nothing wrong  Nothing  Wrong  I love your mind  I love your soul  I love it when you grease your body  And you slide it up and down that pole  Yeah  I love your hair  I love your eyes 
[00:57:00]  And I know that you feel the same way  Cause I can see the love dripping down your thighs  And my mama would laugh  My mama would scoff  If she knew I loved a girl  I'd love to take it off  And she'd probably disown me  If she met my little pearl  But there's nothing wrong  Oh mama  With my Peep Show  Girl  No  No  There's nothing wrong  Nothing  Wrong 
[00:57:30]  So now I'm broke  You bled me dry  And it's amazing how much money that a guy'll spend to taste a little pie  But I'm okay  I'm a little sore  I can't believe that I found love in a place where my feet stick to the floor  And I went to confession and the preacher said 
[00:58:00]  No, it's a single of a girl who isn't pure as driven snow  I said, preacher, I don't care, man  I found heaven in this world  And there's nothing wrong  The preacher  Oh, and my Peep Show  Girl  No  I said, there's nothing wrong  Nothing wrong  With my Peep Show  Girl  Yeah  Steven Lynch, everyone  We love the Peep Shows 
[00:58:30]  I love the Peep Shows, too  Have you gone?  Yeah  No  Oh, come on  Ever  We've gone a bunch of times to Peep Land  But they've changed it now  It's not as cool as it used to be  We had a blast at Peep Land at one time  We were putting the tokens in  And the little board slides up  You guys went together?  Well, we went with a bunch of people  A bunch of guys  A bunch of guys  Yeah  Yeah  We were in the anal intruder room  And all of a sudden 
[00:59:00]  Now there's girls there  Of course you're going to go  Come on  You put the tokens in  And this thing goes up  Wait, wait, wait  If you go to Peep Land by yourself  Then you're the sicko  But if you go with a bunch of guys  It's kind of cool  What do you mean by sicko?  No  We were sitting there  Standing  Because you don't want to sit  Exactly  You put the tokens in  This board comes up  And there's this hole  And her name is Debbie  No, there's a hole in the wall  And you peek in 
[00:59:30]  And there's a girl dancing  In this arena  But you could see the other guys  Looking at the girl  From across the arena  Through their little holes  And they come up  And go  You want to touch?  You want to touch?  I was like  No, I'm just looking  What do you mean?  You have to tip me  Like I don't want to tip  I just  I'm looking  What?  No, you touch  You tip, you touch  And then the thing slides down again  I put some more coins in  It lifts up  She looks and goes  Ah, you again  Why you keep putting in  You no tip 
[01:00:00]  You no touch  I don't want to touch  I just want to look  I was getting in an argument  With a guy  I could go home to my wife  And get this  No tokens  And then she wouldn't  Perform for you  Yeah  But she was performing  For the other guy  And I'm watching  So it was fine by me  I didn't care  Your brother was funny, Ope  He's sticking his head  Through the hole  And his arm  Trying to grab  At her high heel  And she kicked him  It was hysterical  Well, she was trying  To climb up over the thing  Because she got scared  And my brother's  Holding onto her ankle  And then they had 
[01:00:30]  The little video room  Where you go in  And put the tokens in  And you could pick  From thousands of movies  And boy  There's some nasty stuff  Going on in there  It got to the point  Where three guys  In a booth  Watching this  It was like  Maybe we shouldn't  Be in here  I'm feeling a little weird  Watching this  With three guys  We're all pressed  Against each other  Very close  And for five bucks  You could tune in Tokyo  So  Yeah  Five bucks  To cop a feel  It was  Right?  We call it  Tuning in Tokyo 
[01:01:00]  Yeah  It was fun  But I guess  Giuliani put a stop  To that  Well  I passed by the place  And it's like  Kung Fu movie festival  It's like  Oh really?  Oh that old ruse  It's the truth  Yeah they show  Like Bruce Lee movie festivals  And they have the  Ads for that  All over the front  Of the store  Yeah  But then you go  In the back  And I guess  They have the  Smut in there  But they got to do  A 60% legitimate business  To 40% smut  They still have the booth  But it's all plexiglass  Now you can't get  Oh really?  Your arms in there 
[01:01:30]  Damn  No tuning in Tokyo  No tuning in Tokyo  You just got to  Look at the dial  Yeah  No touch  But the  Kung Fu film festival  It's ridiculous  Because you've just  Got to keep putting  Like who's going to  I've got to go  And go  I've got to see  If he kicks him in the face  This is great  More tokens  More tokens  Nah  Not for me  Which detachable hand  Is he going to use this time?  Great  He's got the big blade  Look at him go  Not quite the same 
[01:02:00]  As pumping in the coins  And going  Where's the money shot?  Looking for the money shot  Alright  You want to do another one?
