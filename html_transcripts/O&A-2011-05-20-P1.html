<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts introducing themselves and their controversial style, immediately diving into crude jokes about a tabloid story alleging Arnold Schwarzenegger had sex with a pig in his wife's bed.  This transitioned into a heated debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, sparked by a news item on President Obama's stance.  A call-in segment featured David from Israel and Mike from California (a Jew and a Palestinian respectively), escalating into a shouting match rife with insults, accusations, and competing historical narratives.  Further fueled by calls from Chris (a Muslim) from Massachusetts and Steve from Staten Island, the segment devolved into a chaotic exchange filled with graphic language and accusations of terrorism, concluding without resolution.

The hosts then wrapped up this segment, moving to announce upcoming guests: Bill Burr, Dr. Steve, Chris Hardwick, John Rich (a *Celebrity Apprentice* finalist), and others.  A scheduling conflict with producer Roland regarding John Rich's appearance was discussed.  They reminisced about a sold-out Bill Burr show attended by Stephen Wright, recounting a heckler confrontation involving Greg Charles.  Their dislike of Donald Trump and *Celebrity Apprentice* was voiced, followed by a humorous "one question" interview with Christian Slater by Primetime Sam Roberts.

The show continued with tangents: Opie discussing a wine gift from Dr. Steve (whose price he researched online); his experience running out of gas in Manhattan and a confrontation with a gas station attendant; a lengthy, exasperated discussion about NYC gas attendant regulations and licensing, including sample test questions;  reminiscences about *The Stand*; Opie's fondness for the smell of gasoline; a documentary about an adult baby; appearances by show regulars; a vulgar and sexually charged reimagining of the "Goofus and Gallant" comic strip;  and discussions of TV commercials and the attractiveness of the actresses featured.

A video of "Stanley," an adult baby receiving government assistance, was shown, prompting amusement and outrage over the incongruity of his lifestyle and disability benefits. The hosts highlighted Stanley's activities (drinking from a bottle implied to be urine, being spoon-fed, playing with Legos, and building oversized baby furniture), questioning the fairness of his receiving benefits.  This shifted to a discussion of Big A's recent hospitalization for congestive heart failure and significant weight loss.  A phone call with Big A followed, describing his lifestyle changes and improved health.  Dr. Steve called in to discuss Big A's condition, followed by Stalker Patty, whose discussion veered into personal trauma, including possible childhood molestation, and her recent bankruptcy.  A "Rapture Prank" YouTube video was also discussed. Dr. Steve, PA John, and PA Jill were in studio.

A segment featuring a female caller, "Patty," who declared bankruptcy for $18,000, was highly charged. Opie repeatedly called her a "deadbeat" and demanded she remove her clothing.  Bill Burr left in protest. The segment then shifted to Big A's weight loss and perceived penis enlargement (referencing a humorous "Dr. Steve's rule"), a failed attempt to use a pediatric speculum to examine Patty's vagina, and discussions about Patty's virginity, past, and accusations of childhood molestation.  Chris Hardwick joined, commenting on Burr's departure and the situation's absurdity. John Rich then appeared, discussing his upbringing, *Celebrity Apprentice* experiences (including anecdotes about Gary Busey and Meat Loaf), politics, the American dream, and his country music career.  An unsuccessful attempt to measure E-Rock's head fat percentage concluded the segment.

A discussion about gun ownership ensued, prompted by John Rich detailing his gun safety practices and opposing strict gun control. He contrasted Texas's gun culture with stricter states, arguing restrictive laws lead to higher crime.  He described his home security measures.  Bobo, a recurring character, complained about being snubbed and engaged in a poorly executed physical fitness challenge with the hosts.  A song about a man's obsession with an inflatable doll was played, described as "haunting".  Other brief topics included Chris Hardwick's career, Jim Norton's comedy engagements, and a bizarre badger incident.  The segment continued with significant vulgar language and offensive jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live? No, is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's your headline.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, movie star, ex-politician.  Father of bastard children.  Loves to fuck pigs in his wife's bed. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, no.  That's today's headline.  Now, how do we know where they had their sexual intercourse?  I love the paper.  In her bed!  Was the headline.  Oh!  Well, fuck, if you're going to fuck some broad, where are you supposed to fuck her?  Home field advantage.  You can do a lot better in your own bed.  She's like, all right, Arnie, I'm going to do a speaking...  This is how she talks.  I'm going to do a speaking engagement back in Boston.  I'll see you in a week or so.  Okay, sweetie, I'll see you when you get back. 
[00:02:00]  And then, of course, the pig jumps in the bed with Arnie.  Yeah.  Where are they supposed to fuck?  Uh, come here, let's cuddle.  Oh, God.  Oh, this is getting better and better, this one.  No surprise, right?  No surprise.  God, she gets uglier by the day, too, doesn't she?  She's just a fucking slob.  Someone wrote on my Twitter while I was on the bowl.  I was on the bowl.  That she looks like Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler.  The Wrestler, yeah.  Not the young Mickey Rourke. 
[00:02:30]  No.  No.  So that's your headline today.  In her bed!  In her bed.  Did you think she found some pubes?  Some straight pubes?  Because that woman doesn't look like she's shaved down or nothing.  Oh.  No, Maria finally went to this maid or whatever she did for the household.  I still don't know, really.  And basically said, all right, look, is that fucking Arnie's kid or not?  She was suspicious for years.  Oh, shit.  And finally said, tell me, is that his kid? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And then she, I guess, finally kind of came clean.  Is that what happened?  I think that's what the paper's saying today.  I jerked off on the toilet seat.  She sat down when I was jerking off.  Jerking.  I don't know.  It was accident.  Shit.  Anto's a good one.  How many hacky Arnold Schwarzeneggers are people here these days?  Plenty.  I don't even do a good one.  I do, to be honest with everybody, I do a parody of everyone's hacky Arnold impression. 
[00:03:30]  Sure.  Because you've got to just go.  You've made it your own.  Yeah.  You just kind of.  You have your way of doing voices that makes it your own.  Yeah.  You've got to, you know.  Put your own thing on it.  Jimmy, do one.  It's so easy.  Yeah.  I've been doing them for years.  I'll do them.  I asked Jimmy.  I know.  He don't do impressions.  I'm terminating everything.  That's a good one.  It sounds just like them.  Thanks. 
[00:04:00]  I'm terminating everything.  You should have terminated the fucking pregnancy.  I know.  It's funny.  God damn it.  What was this?  You're pregnant.  Did you guys see the South Park clip of them trashing them?  Oh, no.  I heard about it.  Because you know how those guys, they sometimes don't hand in South Park episodes until like  an hour before they're supposed to air.  Yeah.  So they actually, on Wednesday, got a nice set.  Oh, they did?  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  This is one of their last South Park episodes because, you know, they're going to be dead soon,  Matt and Joe.  Yeah, yeah.  The Muslims are after them.  Muzzies.  The Muzzies.  Here we go.  From South Park.  Then it turns out that Terminator secretly had a kid ten years ago, meaning Terminator  could be his own father.  And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.  No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5.  That really happened.  Skeletor's wheel?  No, dude, that's not Skeletor. 
[00:05:00]  That's Terminator's wife.  Skeletor's a lady?  God damn it.  Skeletor.  All right, I just like the fact that she does.  They managed to actually get that in.  That's my last name.  It remains so topical.  They took some dialogue out and just put that right there.  They probably had like an hour to write that.  They're like, we've got to get something in.  Throw something in there.  Let's throw something together.  Skeletor's a lady.  They're, yeah, they got some Muslim guys pissed off at them for portraying Mohammed in the bear suit. 
[00:05:30]  Again?  That's back?  But he was in the suit, though.  But he's in the suit.  That was the whole thing.  They didn't show him.  He was in the suit.  Where's the Muslim guy?  It doesn't matter.  What else is new?  It doesn't matter.  He's been making threats and posting their address online and calling for...  Oh, is he still doing it?  Yeah, he just got arrested, I think, and calling for people to visit their house.  But that was a few months ago.  Well, actually, it was a while ago, even longer ago, the episode.  I guess this guy's just been, you know, had a hard-on for him for a while. 
[00:06:00]  Just started posting threats.  Threats.  Well, let them deal with that one.  That's okay.  Good luck to you, Mike.  Obama's making everybody happy over there.  Israel and Palestine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That old gag?  Yeah, he's going to get peace over there by telling the Israelis that they should go fuck themselves.  Yeah, he wants to kind of shrink their borders a little bit, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Go back to the 1967 rules.  67 rules.  Is that what he's saying?  It's like, we've got to start by going back to 1967. 
[00:06:30]  Well, how the fuck do we do that?  Pull the borders back to the 67 borders.  How do we do that?  Time machines for everybody.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you pull borders back, Anthony?  You know a little bit about this.  You take all the settlements that the Israelis have built, and you knock them down.  You knock them down, and tell the Palestinians that it belongs to them now.  Wow.  That's what you do.  And who's pissed at Obama for this?  Every Jew, and every Israeli.  New York Jews, I believe they did vote.  There's a lot of Democratic New York Jews, and they are not happy with the Obama alienating 
[00:07:00]  its base.  Not to be too political, but I do wish they would stop building new settlements.  Come on, guys.  You've got to fucking stop building new settlements.  Well, the whole thing is, it's like, they have these buffer zones, so they build their shit,  and then they have to make a buffer zone between where they built the shit and the Palestinians,  because the Palestinians just kind of launch fucking shit into their new houses. 
[00:07:30]  So then they expand their borders, but then they take that buffer zone, and they build on  it.  And then they go, well, now we built on the buffer zone, so now we need a new buffer zone.  So it just kind of does kind of grow out and grow out.  They're just trying to hold on to a little piece of Israel, a little piece of fucking  their Jewish homeland.  But the headline is this old gag.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Every president tries.  I guess if you're the president, you've got to try this thing, right?  Yeah, you've got to try to make everything great and everyone happy over there.  Well, he mentioned Israel 28 times in his speech. 
[00:08:00]  Uh-huh.  Palestine only four times.  Well.  They're keeping track now.  I think they're not happy with what's going on, though.  The Jews are not happy about this one.  Obama's fault, man.  Well, that's Obama's opinion on the whole situation.  I don't think he really has a say in the fucking matter, to tell you the truth.  But the Jews are very mad at him.  Can we go to Israel?  Oh, please.  David.  And our resident, yeah.  Yeah.  David in Israel.  David. 
[00:08:30]  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Hi, David.  Hello, David.  What do you think of Obama and what he's saying, sir?  Actually, nobody is happy.  The Jews aren't happy, obviously.  The Arabs aren't happy either, because they're saying he's not doing enough.  Ah.  Sorry.  He wants it.  I think the Palestinians want it pulled back to the pre-1947 borders.  Yes.  I'm not saying that.  That's the one.  I just want to explain something.  Before 67, they were in their land.  They were there.  We were in our land.  In 1948, when the original borders were set up, it was set up the way it was until 67. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Three countries attacked us.  We defeated three countries attacking us.  It was Egypt, Jordan, and I think it was Syria.  In a week, we killed all of them.  We took over a big chunk of Egypt.  The only reason why we didn't go towards the Capitol and take that over is because the  Americans told us not to.  We were 40 miles out.  Go Jews.  They attacked us.  We beat the shit out of them and took their land.  What do they want?  I mean, does Mexico want California back, and I believe Texas as well? 
[00:09:30]  I think they do, but...  Yeah, but that's never happened.  California sold them anyways.  No, we're giving them back.  Yeah, they gave back Southern California, at least.  Northern California is all about the Asians.  Do you think they should stop building new ones?  That's my issue.  I understand that Israel took that when they got attacked, and they...  Isn't it the 30-day war?  They just kicked the shit out of everybody?  The 30-day war was a six-day war.  We kicked the shit out of three countries in a matter of six days.  Oh, okay.  That was kind of amazing.  Yeah.  Crazy Israelis. 
[00:10:00]  No, he's right.  They was in...  I forget what the air count was.  There was, like, no Israeli jets lost, and they fucking shot everybody else down.  I mean, their air force was superior.  Beat the shit out of their tanks.  Those Israelis...  Six-day war, yes.  Don't you mistake your American Jewish person for an Israeli, because those Israelis are fucking...  They don't fuck around.  ...amazing fighters when it comes to defending their homeland.  But, David, don't you think they should stop building new ones, or how do you feel about that?  Personally, I feel they shouldn't, but at the end of the day, we got the land-fearing square. 
[00:10:30]  We didn't start off with them.  They came over to us and they were fucking with us, and we got them.  I mean, if somebody came to the hands-house with a gun, what should they do?  All right, take my shit?  You're going to blow his head off.  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, if this shit would happen to America, how long do you think the United States would sit around?  If Canada decided one day to stop throwing shit over...  Canada.  Canada.  You know what we tell Canada? 
[00:11:00]  I lick my sweaty balls.  Right.  Canada.  We find a way to apologize and make it our fault for provoking Canada.  You're absolutely right.  David, we would apologize and give them what they wanted.  Yeah, hold on, David.  Hold on.  Don't go anywhere.  I got a Palestinian that is really not happy with David the Jew.  So let's see if we can make our own peace accord right here.  This is Mike from California.  He's Palestinian.  And David in Israel, who, of course, is a Jew. 
[00:11:30]  And this is exactly what Obama's trying to do.  So let's see if we have any luck.  Go ahead, Mike.  Well, first of all, David should learn his history and shut the fuck up.  Oh.  So basically...  That's a good dialogue.  It's not like somebody would have walked in and gotten into Anthony's house and saying,  What are you going to do?  I'm going to take over your land.  It's like Anthony going over to his neighbor's house, getting the shit out of him and saying,  What are you going to do?  And then what's up with somebody?  Who started the war?  Who started the war?  You fucking shoe bastard.  Who the fuck with me, Taylor?  Who the fuck with me, Taylor? 
[00:12:00]  Who the fuck with me, Taylor?  Who the fuck with you are talking about?  You're a bitch, you man, nigga.  Hold on.  That was a 1948 partition, you bitch.  Why don't you follow that 1948 partition?  No.  No.  We did.  We did.  We did.  See, you know what he's talking about.  The very first terrorist, the very first terrorist, the very first terrorist, who blew up all  the trade, or blew up the British.  Remember that?  Before you know it before 1948?  Remember that?  Oh, no.  You don't remember that? 
[00:12:30]  No.  You don't want to remember that.  Oh, there was no terrorist before the Palestinians were there.  Oh, no.  There was no Palestinians before we got there.  How about that one?  What the fuck?  We were there.  You were there.  In 1948, we split it evenly.  We were nice.  In 1967, we were attacked.  What should we do?  It's not ant going out.  Someone's coming after us.  What do you want us to do?  Sit there?  Okay, take all my shit.  No.  You attack me.  I beat the shit out of you.  I took your land.  You want it back, I'll give it to you.  But if you're going to go ahead and keep fighting, look at Egypt. 
[00:13:00]  We took a big chunk of the Sinai Desert.  We were in a fight with them.  We were in a war with them.  Okay?  We made a peace deal.  We gave all their shit back to them.  We gave them back their land.  We're living nicely and happily with them.  How are we supposed to make peace with people that don't recognize us?  We're willing to recognize them.  And they just keep blowing up innocent women and children.  We only go after people that are coming after us.  The only time children...  Let me know when you're done.  Let me know when you're done.  Okay.  The only time that they've gone in Gaza and gone after people and children have been killed 
[00:13:30]  is when they were going after terrorists.  On your end, the terrorists hang out in the populated areas where there's a bunch of children  so they can be casted to you.  So they can...  Ah, okay.  And I want to finish.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  On our end.  Stick to a point.  Stick to a point.  You run over 12 points.  Stick to a point.  Make one point.  Don't sit there and bring up 15 different points.  Because I'm bringing up all your problems and all the shit you lie about and that you won't  talk about and be honest about. 
[00:14:00]  Now talk.  Okay.  First of all, very, very, very first of all, you guys don't want Arabs in your land.  And I can tell you this with personal experience.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead and talk over me.  Go right in.  I got an important thing.  Talk.  You're right.  You're right.  Talk.  I'm biologized.  Talk.  I'll tell you why.  Because very simply, my father and his father, they were born in Jerusalem.  They were born in Jerusalem.  My father is 75 years old.  Guess what?  My father can't live in Palestine or Israel for more than three months at a time.  You know why? 
[00:14:30]  Because they don't allow him there.  Well, he was born there.  He can't live there?  Why can't he go back?  Me?  I can't go visit.  I'll tell you why I can't go visit.  Because I'm an Arab.  I flew back to go visit my parents.  You know what they did?  They told me the next plane to send me back.  You're not allowed in Palestine.  Period.  You don't want AMs here, first of all.  The second of all.  See, see, see.  You keep talking, bro.  You keep talking.  Go on.  Go on.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You know what?  My book.  You know what?  I'm going to stick to one point.  I got that point right there. 
[00:15:00]  How come my father, who was born in that country, how come my mother, who was born in that country, can't live in that country?  Ask me that question.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay.  Okay, fine.  Hold on.  We'll skip that point.  You don't know that point.  You're not going to be stopped.  You're going to say you should.  I don't know.  Let me stop.  I would say that you can't, your father can't go there because it's not the same country anymore. 
[00:15:30]  Things change.  Isn't it called the right of return?  Is that what the problem was?  Where they were afraid, the Jews were afraid that they won't be the majority anymore if they allow all the Palestinians to return?  No, I'm asking you if that's it.  It's more than that.  It's more than that.  It's more than just the right of return.  I'll tell you what the biggest problem is.  The biggest problem is that the Jews are not having enough kids in that country.  So what's happened is that if they gave Palestinians any tax or right, within a certain number of years, the Palestinians are going to overrun and have a majority. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  Like the Puerto Ricans here, right?  Mars.  Where's Mars?  Basically, basically.  So when it's overrun and saying, you can't be there.  Why is it separate?  You can't have an Israeli passport.  You can't have an Israeli passport.  You're not allowed.  So what they do is they bring in Jews from outside so they can try to get to the population.  My parents, my uncles, my brothers, they're born there.  They're not allowed in that country.  Whether it's a different country or not, they can't live there peacefully. 
[00:16:30]  You know, I'll tell you exactly what it's like.  I'll give you a perfect example.  If you're an Arab and you have an Israeli passport, it's like being black in the 40s and 50s.  If you're a Palestinian, it's like being an American Indian.  All the stuff that was done to the American Indians was being done to the Palestinians.  Nah.  Exactly.  And it's being worth it.  Yeah, don't worry about the American Indian.  Can I go to a Palestinian casino?  Hopefully the blackjack dealers treat me better.  You know what?  There was a casino in the Arab population, in the Arab side of the Palestine, because the Jews didn't want it. 
[00:17:00]  What do you bet, clits and fucking stonings?  Hold on the phone, David, in Israel.  We got Chris in Massachusetts, who wants to talk to the Arab.  All right.  All right.  Go for it.  I'm here.  Go ahead, Chris.  Yeah, to that filthy hodgy, and nobody fucking wants you in their country, because you just fucking blow people off for no reason.  Why don't you get with your buddies and tell them to cut the shit, and maybe people will start letting you in.  I love the Boston. 
[00:17:30]  I spoke like a true Boston.  Oh, yeah.  I don't even fucking know your name.  Oh, that's Chris.  I was born in the United States.  And my family, my wife is born in the United States, and my kids are born in the United States.  We're all Muslim.  We have no interest in blowing anybody up.  So whoever you're talking about is a minority, not a majority.  All right.  Let's go back to David.  You go back to wherever you want to fucking come from.  You hit town, hit boy town, and go fuck your sister.  Oh.  So, David, are we going to get along with Mike, or what?  I have no problem. 
[00:18:00]  Which country is the only country in this area that's a democratic country?  The only country that's a free country in the whole area is Israel.  We have a big Arab population in this country.  We have no problem.  The only country that gives social services to people that curse them out every single day is Israel.  In America, if a senator got up and cursed out the United States, they would throw him out in a second.  You have two Arab parties here in Israel that their whole slogan, everything that they have, is the demise of the country that they're in.  And Israel still lets them stay around.  No other country in the world would stand for this shit. 
[00:18:30]  If anybody in America got up and said, I don't like Israel, I don't like America, we're a bunch of idiots, they would throw him out in a second.  We're the only country that let you guys in.  We're the only country where people that don't like us, we give them freedom of speech, we let them do whatever they want, and all they want is more and more and more.  We're willing to talk, but there's nobody to talk with.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.  You're the only country that gives what?  You don't give Arabs anything.  I'll take a real spice up to you.  The Palestinian territories, they don't have a control of electricity. 
[00:19:00]  There's no Palestinian electric company.  There's no Palestinian water company.  There's no...  There's no water in us.  Because they can't us for it.  They can't what?  Because you guys can't us, because you can't get this shit yourself.  No, absolutely not.  This is because Israel doesn't want us there.  Why don't you build it yourself?  Why doesn't the Palestinians...  Because it's not allowed.  It is restricted.  They don't allow you to do this.  And Israel doesn't give any Palestinian any aid?  No way!  Absolutely not.  Okay, one second, let me explain. 
[00:19:30]  Sorry, there's two differences.  There's the Palestinians, and then there's the Arab Israelis that live in Israel.  If you're an Israeli citizen, we're going to take care of you.  If you want your own country, why should I take care of you?  It's like the Mexicans, well, it actually does happen in America,  but it's like the Mexicans that want free aid from America,  and if they're not American citizens, why should they get it?  If you want your own country, do your own shit.  Support yourselves.  If you're an Israeli, even if you're an Arab, it doesn't matter what religion you are,  you will get money from the state.  If you're a student, you're a Christian, and you're in this country,  the state will give you money, and it'll help you support yourself.  It doesn't matter who you are. 
[00:20:00]  The Arabs in this country get a lot of support.  The Israeli Arabs that are here, they get whatever they want.  They get all the social programs.  If you're not an Israeli, you want to be a Palestinian,  you want to be a different country, why should I support you?  And yes, this is unheard of.  Let me just finish my point, and you can talk.  Israel collects taxes on behalf of the Palestinians,  and we give over the money all the time to them,  knowing that that money ends up turning around against us.  So whenever any of your products come in, we tax it, and we give you the money.  Which other country would do anything like that?  Okay, first of all, you're bullshit. 
[00:20:30]  And I'll tell you why you're bullshit.  That's not true.  Okay, why am I bullshit?  Okay, I'll tell you why it's bullshit.  Because when my father goes to visit in Israel, and we've got a house there, bro,  there is a freeway driving right by our house.  And guess what?  If you're an Arab, you're not allowed on that freeway.  Only Israelis are allowed on that freeway.  If you're an Israeli Arab, I'm telling you, it's like being black in the 50s.  You have your separate waterfowl.  You have your separate freeways.  You're not allowed on these streets.  There are Israeli Arabs who cannot go from one part of the country to the other. 
[00:21:00]  Why?  Because the last name is Arabic.  There's no way you're going to sit there and tell me that an Israeli Arab has the same right as an Israeli Jew.  No.  Whether you're an Arab, whether you're a Christian.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You spoke, right?  You spoke.  Go on, dude.  Go on.  Hold on.  What most people don't realize is that there's a lot of Palestinian Christians there who are treated the same exact way.  Besides whether you're being Muslim or not, there's a lot of Palestinian Christians who are treated the same exact way. 
[00:21:30]  All right, hold on.  Hold on, David from Israel.  Everybody wants in.  I want to go to TJ, who has lived in the Middle East.  And TJ, you're on with Mike, the Palestinian.  Morning, gentlemen.  I was in Bahrain in the Navy for a couple years, and I tried to get a fuel for the land by, you know, when I'm in taxis.  I told them to the cab drivers, you know, because they have a pretty good feel of what's going on.  They said to the taxi driver once, they said, what's up?  You know, the Palestinians, why don't you invite them into your country? 
[00:22:00]  You know, Bahrain, they seem to be having a lot of issues over there in Israel.  And the taxi driver essentially said to me, Palestinians, how do I say in your country, America, they're the same as niggers or trailer tracks.  They don't want them in our country.  Really?  Is that, like, yeah, because you wonder why the Palestinians aren't given a homeland by, you know, Egypt or any other of the Arab countries around there.  Why is it so necessary to have a piece of Israel?  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  By the way, Anthony, I'll be 100% honest with you. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  If Israel took the whole country and said, listen, we are going to treat everybody the same, anybody who says no is an idiot, absolutely is an idiot.  They will not.  They don't want the Arabs there because of the population.  The Jews are not growing fast enough.  Well, is it the population, or is it that there has been a history of violence against the Israelis by Arabs in their own country of Israel? 
[00:23:00]  Well, hold on for a second.  Yes.  There's two separate things there for a second.  One, it's the population, because, and I'll give you a perfect example.  In California, there's a lot of Hispanics, and Hispanics are in the government.  Hispanics are part of the community.  There's a huge effort in that.  That same scenario is going to happen in Israel if they gave the Arabs citizenship.  But let me tell you something, you're talking about, I don't buy the analogy of anything American put onto Israel and the Palestinian situation, because it's a different place. 
[00:23:30]  Israel doesn't have the Constitution we have.  People don't automatically get the rights that Americans have.  I know they do have their own version of a Constitution, but it's not the American Constitution.  So if they want to discriminate against Palestinians, I believe they are able to, allowed to.  And I think they have to do things purely out of self-preservation, because over the years it has been proven that Arab people do not want Israel there, do not want the Jewish people to have a homeland there, 
[00:24:00]  and have tried numerous times to wipe them off the face of the earth.  And I guess that left a bad taste in their mouth.  They hate each other.  Listen to these two guys go at it.  Oh, I know.  There's a special...  I love that.  You Jew motherfucker and okay, sand nigger.  That was...  And that was within the first five seconds of the conversation. 
[00:24:30]  That's what Obama's going to hear if he gets a couple of these guys together.  Do you guys...  Do you remember...  I don't know if either one of you saw, there was a special done by suicide bombers.  A girl...  A teenage girl suicide bombed and killed another teenage girl in a supermarket.  It was a pretty big, you know, story.  And the mother of the...  The Jewish mother of the victim and the Palestinian mother of the bomber were trying to meet for like five years.  And they just...  They finally met like via...  Sike? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, they couldn't actually get it together.  It's so hard to get it together over there where they could just meet in person.  Wow.  And at the end, they just fucking hated each other.  Shit, they couldn't make like a moment.  Dude, I saw a special on the Holocaust where a woman who survived the Holocaust...  What?  And a lot of Jews are married to her because she forgave the Germans publicly.  Oh, really?  And she just cannot live with the Palestinians.  She fucking hates them.  They hate each other.  Yeah.  There's a guy on Twitter saying, tell this fuck they don't let them on their freeway because the fuckers would blow it up. 
[00:25:30]  See, now on the other side, I'm not going to say that every Palestinian or Arab is blowing up every part of Israel when they go in there.  But you can't blame the Israelis for being a little leery when they're surrounded by people that hate them.  And it is a little difficult, I think, to get some kind of agreement with the Palestinians when it's almost like you're opening the door to your enemy.  And I know the Palestinians don't feel that way.  They feel like, you know, this is our homeland, too. 
[00:26:00]  And I don't think that's ever going to get solved.  Here's the issue.  Okay.  David, you're back on the line, by the way, just so you know.  David from Israel.  Here's the issue.  In the 1980s, there was before the Tefada, there was a lot of peace.  And the reason why there was a lot of peace is that because the Palestinians were able to go to work, they were able to do what they were doing.  If you look at it now, they've built these walls that are called apartheid walls, that they are to protect themselves.  And what this is is, you're laughing at me, what this is is that they can't go to work because they're not allowed through that wall. 
[00:26:30]  So now it's like, well, I can't go to work.  I can't feed my family.  Israelis return the water off.  Israelis return electricity off.  Wait a minute.  I've got to survive.  Now let David explain.  I won't say it, but let David explain why those walls were built.  Okay.  Oh, no.  It's the question is what came first, the chicken or the egg.  All I can say is statistics have shown that since that wall went up, suicide attacks went actually down. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  It's actually stopping people from coming in.  Another point I want to make is there's a big difference between Arab Israelis and Palestinians.  Like I said before, Arab Israelis, Israelis that have citizenship in Israel, can move around as freely as Israelis.  Palestinians, on the other hand, can't.  Now, what Mike said before is true, that they're like the black people from back in the 60s.  And, yes, when I go through checkpoints, they wave me on.  If there's an Arab, they'll ask him for identification, then they'll move on.  And I agree, you can call it racism, call it whatever you want. 
[00:27:30]  There's a reason why it's done.  It's because Jews aren't blowing up their own country.  The Arabs are.  It's the same thing like what Ant was saying back on about the Oklahoma City bombing.  You know, black people aren't going around.  They're not mass murderers.  It's usually the white dude that's doing it the same way who's doing all the bombings.  It's the Arabs.  I'm not saying everything going on as bad.  I'm not saying you're bad.  Mr. Jewy Jew, tear down that wall.  Hey, can you guys explain the Oslo agreement and how that was kind of close?  What went wrong with that? 
[00:28:00]  I honestly don't look into it a lot.  You know what, Jimmy?  I gave up a long time ago.  It's actually the Oslo agreement.  They were talking and then just decided to smoke pot and play games.  My friend was a man who owned the cellar who was an adamant Israeli.  Yes.  But he was a smart guy.  He wanted to debate the Palestinian prime minister, I think, and the guy backed out like  he was going to debate him and he wouldn't.  Wow.  Like, man, he was a smart guy.  And he said that in Oslo, like, the Jews gave everything the Palestinians wanted except  for like 3% of the land, which was strategic. 
[00:28:30]  He said they offered everything.  And they turned it down.  No, actually.  What's that?  It was 98% they offered.  Okay.  So I said 98%.  I was saying 93%.  98%.  Wow.  I'm saying except for 3%.  For Jews, every single percent counts.  Okay.  But it was...  Oh, Jesus.  I, I, uh, there was a, uh, a relative of a man.  He's a Jewish, very, very liberal woman who was very, very pro-Palestinian.  And she was an interpreter and she was in those meetings.  And then she just turned and she said they offered them everything and they said no. 
[00:29:00]  Who was that, Arafat fucking, uh, Saba?  No, no.  Oh, I'm sorry, yes, yes.  Yes.  So I don't understand what that was about.  Well, I could tell you exactly what that was about.  When Arafat died, he had, what, 23 million in the bank?  He did not have the Palestinian people in his, for his whatchamacallit.  Only thing him and the current Habas, all they're in it for is in their money.  They have no interest.  You know, I, I, I know, because he had this.  And whatchamacallit, because they're, they're in it for the money. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, he had the same suit that Hans Gruber had.  The only, only, only group that had the Palestinian in mind was Hamas.  That's the only group.  They're the ones who take the money and put them into schools.  They take the money to build hospitals.  They take the money to build this.  They're the only...  And they go ahead and kill three-month-old babies in their sleep.  That, too.  Just, just put that in as well.  Really?  Yup.  Didn't that happen to me tomorrow, a few months ago, three months ago?  Oh, really?  And, and, and, and, and it's really good. 
[00:30:00]  Dude, there is a video of, of a father protecting his son.  An Israeli soldier shot him.  There's a video of Israeli, six Israelis, beating a five-year-old kid.  There's pictures and videos of Israelis using children at S.H.I.E.L.D.  Do you know what the Israeli army is there?  They're not there for peace.  They are there to protect the settlement.  That's the only reason why the Israeli army is in there.  That's it.  There's a job to protect the settlement.  And you know what?  There's, there was a movie, there was a movie made in the U.K. called The Promise. 
[00:30:30]  It is a perfect example of what goes on in Israel.  The Promise?  Yeah, it's called The Promise.  The U.K. movie.  It's, I, I, I, I, I watched all six hours of it and it's sitting and I couldn't believe it.  And I learned so much about how bad, what they've done to that country.  Sounds like a chick.  Yeah.  Sorry, Sarah Jessica Parker is the horse who tries to save the Middle East.  I like it.  I like the cover of the, uh, the, uh, disc, the movie poster and stuff.  It's got like an Arab and a Jew in there back to back. 
[00:31:00]  And it's like, and the, and the Palestinians holding on to the Jews' prayer shawl.  And he's going, oh, look at you.  And the Palestinians are like, oh, you.  Oh, yeah, the Jew is holding on to his bomb belt so he can't pull it.  The movie is actually about how Israel was created through the eyes of a British shoulder.  And it, you know, goes back and forth to see now and then.  But it's actually a really good movie.  And you ought to give up one of our children.  I was so sad.  Should we have, should we have closing arguments now? 
[00:31:30]  Closing arguments.  We've got David live from Israel and Mike in California, who's the Palestinian.  Yes, we'd like some kind of solution here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, okay, Mike, you go first.  Mike.  David, you go first.  Oh, David.  Oh, boy.  After you.  After you.  They're even going to argue who goes first.  Let's toss a coin and watch David snatch it out of the air.  So we'll never know if it's head or tails.  Went through ten coins already.  I keep it.  That never hits the ground.  I know. 
[00:32:00]  It's like picking him up like a frog tongue with a fly.  I love David from Israel because, no offense to David, comes across slightly wimpy when  he calls our show, but very informative.  But, man, when it comes right down.  Oh, his Jew comes out.  He'll fucking snap your neck.  Exactly.  Big cape with a J on it.  Right.  David doesn't play games.  David does not play games.  Fucking David of the Mossad.  So have you guys decided who goes first and why?  You know, I'll go first. 
[00:32:30]  And just for the fact that there's never going to be peace there.  And nobody wants peace there because it's not worth it to have peace.  It's all about money.  And it's all about Israeli wanting all of the land.  They don't want to share it.  And that's just the bottom line.  Palestinians don't want to go anywhere else.  And, you know, that's it.  There's just no way for peace to happen there.  And, David, any rebuttal there on Mike's comment there?  I agree with him.  I don't think there's going to be peace anytime soon.  I think eventually there will be something catastrophic that's going to have to happen 
[00:33:00]  for there to be peace.  I mean, I understand they want their land.  But, again, who attacked you?  Who came after who?  Right.  That's number one.  And number two, we were kicked out of your lands back in the day.  We were, you know, allowed to come from Syria and stuff like that.  I don't see you guys opening your doors to take them out.  Oh, man.  And letting us have the right of return to come back to you guys.  God.  First of all, we were there first before 1948.  So who came first, the chicken or the egg?  It was us.  We were there first.  We opened up the doors.  You all came in. 
[00:33:30]  We were all welcoming you.  There was no problems before 1948.  You can't sit there and say, oh, Jews always at problems.  Before 1948, the Jews and Palestinians lived peacefully.  Or that.  And then we split up the country and everybody was living nicely until you guys came along  and attacked us.  Who attacked who?  David, David, David.  The country wasn't split evenly.  The country was split 90% in favor of Israel, 20% of Palestinians. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, on top of that, we were going to go separately, which means that in order to get from one Palestinian territory to the other,  you have to go to the state of Israel.  That doesn't work.  No way should that work.  Isn't the big sticking point that both of you want dibs on Jerusalem?  That's another one.  I think that was the sour point with the 98%.  Yeah.  The other 2% was Jerusalem.  Was Jerusalem.  We'll call that there.  Right.  That's the big part.  At the end of the day, I don't think it's this part of land.  I don't think it's that part of land.  We just don't trust them based on history and they're pissed off at us. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  Based on how we treat them because of what they do to us.  And we don't like them because every single time there's a bombing.  I love that point.  I love it.  I love, they don't treat us because of the way they don't like us because of history  and they don't like us because of what we do to them because of what we do to defend ourselves.  Can they just agree to dismember each other?  You know what, man?  You know what?  The bottom line is that my father goes back.  He stays there for three months.  He comes back.  He's not allowed in that country.  My uncles are not allowed in that country. 
[00:35:00]  It's just that basic human right.  If you're an A-Rab in that country, you do not have basic human right.  Bottom line.  All right.  Hold on.  One second.  If a Jew went to Syria, how long do you think they'd keep him there before they kill him?  Oh.  Or if a Jew went to the Gaza Strip, how long do you think he'll live there before they go in and take his head off?  Why would you say he has a house in Israel?  He has a house in Israel.  He can't live in his house.  We're talking about... 
[00:35:30]  Is he an American citizen?  He is an American citizen.  He was born there.  He is an American citizen.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  I know the deal is if you're an American, you come in for three months on a tourist visa, and after that you have to get some of the paperwork.  Wouldn't that be any immigrant, or...  It's more than that.  It's more than that.  I got family in Jordan who can't visit.  Dude, I went to go visit.  Me, personally, as an American citizen, with an American passport, born in America, I went to go visit.  They're like, no, you're not allowed in. 
[00:36:00]  They turned me back.  Why?  Okay.  Why?  Because, again, like I said, there's history.  They don't know who you are.  They don't trust you.  So a lot of Arabs do come into this country.  And a lot of Pakistanis have personal business partners.  The Jews have got to start trusting.  First of all, they don't know who I am.  There's a lie, and I'll tell you why they don't know who I am.  And I'll tell you why.  It's hard to end this.  Because the computers between Israel and America are linked.  There have been times where my family has gone, and they bring up a lot of the traveling history, a lot of the history that's there. 
[00:36:30]  And they were able to go in, but they're able to see their traveling history.  So it's not like they don't know who I am.  They know who's coming in out of the country.  You know?  They know exactly who's coming in.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Steve on Staten Island wants to talk to the Palestinians.  Steve, go ahead.  How are you, guys?  How are you doing?  This Arab guy loves to reinvent history.  You know, he threw out the words that they all did.  It was their land first.  Well, I got to know something.  They built the Dome of the Rock on our temple, but not the other way around.  So we were there well before them thousands of years ago. 
[00:37:00]  Number two, he keeps talking about, oh, you know, Arabs want peace, and, you know, it's all the Jews for.  You know, throughout history, Arabs cannot live with anybody but Arabs.  In India, the Arabs went crazy.  They had to create Pakistan because they were killing each other.  Now, in Jerusalem, I mean, I'm sorry, in Israel, when it was created, the Jews begged the Arabs, please stay, don't leave, when the U.N. created.  What'd they do?  The Arabs left, came back, and attacked them.  They attacked them two times after that. 
[00:37:30]  The reason that nobody could ever live in peace with these people is they're animals.  One point at a time, bro.  One point at a time.  Okay, well, you can't multi-gast and, you know, multiple things?  All right, one point at a time.  All right?  You'll be in 2011.  You bring your rocks, I'll bring my tank.  Oh, shit.  You know what?  It's funny, because you know who paid for that tank?  Me as an American citizen paid for that tank.  Uh-huh.  That's who paid for that tank.  Me as an American citizen.  I'm the biggest pro-patriot American in this country, but let me tell you something. 
[00:38:00]  The Israelis are a very self-sufficient country.  The only reason America has to give them money is because no country of that size can defend themselves  against 300, 400 million animals living around them.  Mike, you wanted to rebut?  I'm sorry?  No, no, Mike wanted to rebut.  Yeah, Mike has something on that.  First of all, it's very, very, very, very simple.  So, we as an American citizen, when Israel gets $4 billion a year, all right, that money... 
[00:38:30]  We just spent over a trillion dollars fighting you people, continue.  Righteous buck.  Wow.  Wow, wow.  This country, this country, America, gives Israel over $4 billion.  We just forgave Egypt a billion dollar debt yesterday.  We spent trillions of dollars fighting you people from trying to kill our babies, women, children.  See, that's a difference. 
[00:39:00]  You also mentioned originally, let's go back, because I like to multitask.  You mentioned originally that issues with the original terrorists when they were fighting the British.  See, the big difference is when I have a terrorist that fights the military and not only fights them,  but lets them know, hey, we're going to blow up this place, so you may want to get your soldiers out.  They actually even gave the British warnings before they attacked.  There's a big difference between a person attacking a military target and a person strapping a bomb on a 12-year-old 
[00:39:30]  and sending him into a bus station.  And if you can't see the difference in that, then it just proves you're an idiot.  You know what?  You know what?  Let's go back a little bit here.  King David Hotel, when the British Army was there,  What? I don't remember that.  Yeah, the King David Hotel in 1945, when it was blown up by a Jewish terrorist.  What did you give them?  Oh, we didn't give them one.  Okay.  Excuse me. 
[00:40:00]  The Jews gave the British the warning  and told them that the King David Hotel was going to be blown up at this time and this day.  Well, the British weren't good enough talking to milk to find the bomb.  Oh, so, so, so, so, so, let me get this.  That's their own problem.  They couldn't find the bomb.  Let me get this.  But again, you go, you tell somebody else.  You like to make the point that, oh, the Jews were the terrorists before.  The Jews were the terrorists before.  Let me ask you.  You guys don't like Christians.  You don't like Hindus.  You don't like anybody who's an atom. 
[00:40:30]  In fact, you don't even like other terrorists.  So let's get to the fact that you guys just can't live with anybody.  The fact that I mean, you know what your problem is?  You want to sit there and talk to them well.  You do whatever you want.  This is why Obama's wasting his time.  Just like the rest of the president that tried.  I'm going to talk over you.  You're not going to make it work.  I'm going to talk to you.  You're not talking to you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look, there's a corner.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  What are you talking to you?  You don't.  And that's the reason you have to pick me for food. 
[00:41:00]  Talk over me.  I'm loving the poison.  The way you talk is why your motherfucking family is storming in Gaza.  Because they don't even have a farm.  The Jews took a desert and turned it into a fucking agricultural center.  What the fuck do you get to me?  I'm going to get this shit.  We took it.  Don't fucking sit there.  You guys took it in 1948.  They're what?  You guys took it in 1948.  Look, look what you did in 1948.  This guy's being called Jew Pesci.  Jew Pesci. 
[00:41:30]  That's a good one.  Jew Pesci.  Jimmy James.  Thank you.  Uneducated California.  I'm uneducated.  It really is an example of just how futile this is.  That was a good point, though.  I heard that one.  You find that corner yet?  Right.  This is what it sounds like over there all the time.  I got a couple quarters.  How many quarters do you want to shut the fuck up?  That's wonderful. 
[00:42:00]  Answer to me.  Now, do you want to get to the points or do you want to get the personal bullshit attached?  Because I'm allowed to buy and sell you with that.  My family may own your family.  You haven't stopped talking.  Do you understand that you have not talking?  Did you got on the fucking phone?  You have not stopped talking.  Because all you've done is you've tried to bully poor little David over there.  I haven't stopped talking.  He is too bashing.  Thank God.  All the Jews ain't like David or else we would have lost a war 30 years ago.  Oh, shit.  Let me explain.  Let me explain.  Let me explain. 
[00:42:30]  Why don't you answer that?  Why don't you answer one fact?  Why don't you answer one fact?  Why don't you answer this one fact?  We wouldn't have had this conversation if it wasn't for my David.  Because you keep talking.  I love the song of my cock built on top of King David's.  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  You're talking again.  What did you say?  What?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  There you go.  You're a very intelligent man.  You're the right to create.  You're the right to create your own history.  The fact remains that there are Irish on the Israeli.  This is my last relationship. 
[00:43:00]  I love this.  You are any Jews.  We are an eight.  Jews.  Iron F.  Jew.  Yeah.  We need Jews only here because of this.  You guys are fucked, man.  The only thing you guys are, I manipulate it.  The only thing you're begging us for electricity.  Four minutes ago, you were thinking about electricity, but we're fucked.  My friend, if we have electricity, you're fucked.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you guys have electricity.  Exactly.  Oh, wait.  Are you an Israeli or are you an American? 
[00:43:30]  Who are you an American?  My father's an Israeli, but my allegiance is to this country.  But when I hear an idiot like you reinventing history, reinventing history to try and move  your point, that's what I said.  It's fully documented.  The only people who reinvented history are you.  You guys sit down and you make up.  You don't have a valid point to stand on.  Okay, you know what?  Let's sit down, gentlemen, for a minute.  Originally, your point was that the Jews took your land.  Is that correct?  In 1948, the U.N. gave Jews the land. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  Okay.  Do they not?  So, what happened 2,000 years ago?  You act like the Jews have zero claim to that land.  It's just yours.  You guys started it.  Do we have any claim to the land?  Do you have any claim to the land?  Do you have any claim to the land?  Have it two years ago?  Absolutely not.  You know, all the time you have claim to the land is when it was given to you in 1948.  Okay, so before that don't matter.  When the Arab people have the Jews throughout history, there's no claim. 
[00:44:30]  So, Matthew, should the Jews have the Middle East?  Why would that matter?  He's talking like 2,000 years ago.  2,000 years ago, when in 1948, you're given the land.  Now, let me ask you a question here.  I don't know your name.  Let me ask you this question here.  The people that were in that land, when it was given to Israelis, when it was given to Israel, the people in that land that were Arabs were not allowed to stay.  They had to leave.  Actually, you're wrong about that.  The Jews asked the Arabs, don't leave, don't stay. 
[00:45:00]  We can do this together.  What you guys decided to do was leave and immediately turn around, make a U-turn, and kill us.  That is not true.  U-turn.  The Jews at that time, the Jews at that time, were going door-to-door, killing everybody.  Oh, shit.  They don't want them to be in that town.  Okay.  There you go.  That's a reinvention of history 101.  There you go.  That's what the Arab people were doing.  Jews are going to the door.  You know why I feel really bad for you?  Because apparently your father's been lying to you your whole life.  Oh, shit. 
[00:45:30]  Your father's just been giving you...  Bringing a father into it.  Oh, shit.  That's how she does, though.  Woe is me.  The Jews hate us.  Let me ask you a question.  Are they really...  Let me ask you something.  They are the master of woe is me.  Let's pull the Jews out of this equation for a second.  How about the Christians?  How are they treated in Arab countries?  Very well.  Absolutely.  Are they really?  So now you're telling me that Christians are treated well.  I got stuck in the middle of a bunch of Palestinians. 
[00:46:00]  Pow, boom, bang, ping, pow.  If you don't want to hear the answer, you're going to talk over everybody.  That's what you do.  You don't want to talk over you.  I'm not talking over you when it comes to that subject.  The fact remains, Christians are not treated well in Arab countries.  I don't know if Mike is arguing with a cartoon.  In fact, wasn't it a few months ago that there were some churches being burned all over the Arab world?  Absolutely not.  That's part of the answer.  Sponsor.  This is... 
[00:46:30]  Sponsor.  Give me an example.  Let me know.  You want to pound that shit all night?  Oh, that's fucking...  You're allowed to know your question.  People are being entertained by this.  Wow.  I love it.  It's just a great insight.  Why Obama's wasting his time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're all wasting your time.  Because this is street level.  Yeah, this is it.  You too are...  If the Jews pulled out.  If the Jews pulled out of Israel tomorrow, and you guys pulled out 14 years ago, all right? 
[00:47:00]  Is it still us?  Is it still the Jews, folks?  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear y'all.  It's going to be the cussing y'all.  See, I'm just saying, like, you guys are stripping it down from, you know, the politicians and Obama and Netanyahu and all of these fucking leaders and everything to street level.  This is the population.  These are the people.  And it's, to me, the situation is hopeless. 
[00:47:30]  It absolutely is hopeless because, you know, politicians are worthless on both sides.  And I'm not going to say that Israeli politicians are really better than Arab politicians.  I agree.  I made him agree.  The Anthony Peace Accord right there.  I agree that the politicians suck and it will never be solved.  The people in the street on the Arab side feel like him.  On the Jewish side feel like me.  And the fact that means there will never be peace there.  The guy in the middle is saying, what do you want from me?  Yep.  The guy in the middle is the children.  What did Steve say about Obama at the end of that rant? 
[00:48:00]  I said Obama can do whatever he wants.  He can do.  The man's 67 borders.  He can send flowers.  He can forgive debt.  It's not going to change the feeling of the average person in the street.  When you're a person, an Israeli, for example, who gets in a bus and has to worry, oh, shit,  this guy's two shades of mocha, he may blow the bus up.  Two shades of mocha.  Hold on.  My turn.  My turn.  The motor transportation for troops in Israel is the bus.  That's how troops get around Israel, by the bus. 
[00:48:30]  So when they blow up a bus, they're blowing up Israeli soldiers.  Oh, real?  Okay, so those little 13-year-old girls, you see pieces of them, those are soldiers, too.  So now Israel has slave-labor children in the army.  The only people 17 and 16 I see getting killed are Jews, and I see Palestinians getting killed  when they strap bombs on themselves.  Oh, really?  Maybe if you people, you people should first gain a respect for human life. 
[00:49:00]  When you can respect human life, then maybe you'll stop blowing yourselves up, and then  you'll be able to respect other people's lives.  Yeah, we blow ourselves up because we've got nothing better to do.  It's got nothing to do with self-depression.  Apparently, you are nothing better to do.  You guys blow on electricity.  You want to have a man up school?  How about you guys when you blow up school?  How about you guys when you kill children?  When you blow up school?  That doesn't happen.  We don't do that.  Are you talking about Gaza?  When you dumb motherfuckers decided to use children as a shield by shooting rocks?  What if I lose children as a shield for those Israelis? 
[00:49:30]  So, and there's proof of that, my friend.  So, should we actually not attack terrorists because you guys are cowards and hiding fools?  Dude, I'm going to be booed by the time you go with this bullshit here.  No, you're going to have a million people.  One day tomorrow, you're going to wake up and say, damn.  What do we do?  Wow.  This is insane.  You're going to wake up tomorrow.  This is insane.  This is insane.  It is just a mutual.  You want to have time on this?  Yeah, we have to take a break.  Yeah, yeah, we do have to call time.  It has to be an hour.  We've got a lot of compliments. 
[00:50:00]  Yes, yes.  I think we've got a lot of compliments here.  We've started a dialogue, which is good.  We've started a dialogue.  We are close.  We're definitely close.  Yes.  You know, I can taste it.  Listen, listen.  Closing statements, hopefully.  Steve in Staten Island, you first.  Yes.  Staten Island, until Arabs will recognize not only Israel's right to existence, but that  Jews are not monkeys, there will never be peace.  But the difference is, we will always whoop their ass in the fight. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  And then it's your turn.  Mike?  Mikey?  All we want are basic human rights.  That's the bottom line.  All Palestinians want are basic human rights.  They want a right to exist.  That's all they want.  That's the bottom line.  I'm a violinist.  Look who's talking about the violinist.  Look who's talking about the violinist.  And there they go.  They can't just do a closing statement.  All right, listen.  This tour, un-fucking-believable. 
[00:51:00]  Steve in Staten Island, thank you so much.  Guys, it's been a pleasure.  Thank you for hearing this.  Thank you, Mike.  They're calling you Jew passion.  Call back soon, please, Steve.  Mike, good job.  Thank you, Mike.  Mike, thank you so much.  Calling from California.  The Palestinian side.  We greatly appreciate it.  And, of course, I'm very surprised David stayed on the line.  He just lost some money on hold there.  David, Israel, who started this whole thing.  Also, one thing to ask.  Did you get my contact information from last time? 
[00:51:30]  Wait, did I?  I don't think I did.  Oh, he was supposed to.  Yeah, it just matters to me the money, so.  Okay.  All right, David.  If you put me in hold, I'll give it to you again.  All right, David from Israel.  In the heart of the situation.  Wow.  Thank you, David.  All this doesn't mean shit because the world's ending.  The world ends tomorrow.  Do the Jews and the Palestinians think the world's ending?  I don't know.  But it sure sounds like the beginning of the end right there. 
[00:52:00]  There is such hatred between those peoples.  It will never be resolved.  That's why when I saw Obama on TV, I'm like, this old shit.  Just shut up.  What the hell is he going to accomplish?  Just shut the fuck up.  By the way, why do we forgive a billion dollars in debt to Egypt?  That's the type of shit that makes me so sick.  It's a bribe to keep them from fucking around with, you know.  But they still want to fuck us for more money afterwards.  You were reading that thing which annoyed me so much about gas pumping. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, we'll talk about that, yeah.  It's like they just got to fuck you for more money.  That's a good one.  It's constantly being fucked.  This is what we're going to do.  We're going to take a break.  We have a really fucking busy show.  Bill Burt, Dr. Steve, Chris Hardwick, John Rich, who's in the finals of the Celebrity Apprentice.  Bobo, Bobo, Big A, Big Stalker Patty, The Rapture's Tomorrow.  Do you know who John Rich is?  I don't know who he is.  He's just a finalist in the Celebrity Apprentice thing.  He asked us on the way out.  We both said no.  Yeah, we said no, and then Roland was saying no. 
[00:53:00]  I said, I don't care, or I don't give a shit.  And what I was saying was, I don't give a shit about the show, The Apprentice.  And I said no about the guest.  But then it was turned around to, I don't give a shit.  Like, yes or no, book him or don't.  And he turned it into a book him.  Well, then he cornered me, and I said yes, but that's not how.  I'm just one vote.  No, we're with it.  Right, right, right.  So he cornered me, but it's a huge show, and the guy's a finalist. 
[00:53:30]  Roland's coming down the hall.  Yeah, we can't be squeezing in.  I don't care if he's here or not.  As Roland takes his time walking down the hall.  On the way, we got an update on the adult baby.  Oh, yeah.  Noise tweets yesterday, fantastic.  And an update on Botox Mom.  Yes.  After the break.  Botox Mom.  But first, Roland, quickly, before the break.  Hello, Roland.  Roland, was there a misunderstanding yesterday in any way, shape, or form?  Are we going to have to tape record these conversations? 
[00:54:00]  I'm tired today.  If you don't want them, I'll email right now.  What's the matter?  What?  What's the matter with your voice?  Went out for the show, trying to get a bigger guest.  What show?  What the fuck are you here?  Right here.  This show.  You said you went out for the show.  Yeah, for this show.  I think you went to just watch a show.  No.  Well, I went to see Bill Burr, and then we went to the other bars.  Okay.  Oh, oh, okay, because you sound a little raspy today.  Tired?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll leave you alone.  My friends, I didn't know they had off today, so it's three in the morning. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, late night.  You only stopped partying four hours ago?  Yeah.  Wow.  Holy shit.  What do you got there?  Anything fun?  Oh, no.  It's short.  Oh, yeah.  That will take you out.  Thanks.  Greg Charles said hello.  Greg Charles.  Great.  Bill Burr killed last night.  Of course he did.  Bill Burr's great.  It was sold out.  It was like packed.  Yeah.  Sold out on Thursday.  Yeah, Bill Burr's great.  It was a standing room only, and it was, Stephen Wright came by to see Bill Burr, like  a bunch of older comics.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  I just heard this guy laughing, and then one woman goes, can you shut up?  And you hear, okay.  Like that voice.  Oh, why?  And I turn around to Stephen Wright.  I'm like, oh, shit.  Who told him to shut up?  Some fat broad.  Because he was laughing?  Because he was laughing.  He goes, yeah, that's a really good, like he just said, that was a really good point that  Bill made.  Yeah.  And the one woman goes, can you be quiet?  Oh, shut up, you cunt.  And then you see Greg like this.  He went there and kind of like lashed at the woman.  Really good.  Good for Greg Charles.  Yeah.  He didn't take any cup from that. 
[00:55:30]  No.  And Greg goes, are you a lesbian?  And the one woman goes, no.  He goes, you should be.  Wow.  Wow.  You hammered him.  Is the Sunday show sold out for Bill Burr?  Uh, he said just about.  It has to be.  They're doing like standing tickets now for him.  Jesus.  Good for Bill Burr.  He's got six shows at Carolinas, right?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, eight shows.  Yeah, DeRosa and Duxinier opened up.  He was a really funny guy.  All right.  I don't know him, but DeRosa always kills, too.  Yeah.  All right.  Are we taking John Rich for a few minutes or I don't? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We are.  I'm not going to tell him no now.  Yeah, that's not nice.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  We'll just throw him in his ass.  Fuck that show.  I'll take him, but I'm just sick of it.  I hate Trump so much.  I'm sick of it.  I couldn't tell you one fucking second of that show.  You're fired.  You're fired.  Meatloaf.  Losing his mind a little bit.  I like Meatloaf.  Oh, that was from that show.  Right.  Okay.  Trump and his dumb, miserable face.  Yeah, I can't watch The Apprentice myself.  I don't know how it's still on.  But I understand why he wouldn't want to run the free world and want to continue with 
[00:56:30]  that show.  Oh, of course.  It makes perfect sense if you're like Donald Trump.  Yeah.  Let's, uh, Palestinian gotta eat.  Yeah.  It's one question time.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest  we couldn't get. 
[00:57:00]  Star of film and television, Robin Hood star, Christian Slater.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Christian Slater.  Christian, do you watch Top Chef?  No.  Thank you so much for your time.  My pleasure.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on  The Opie and Anthony Show.  F*** this. 
[00:57:30]  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday.  It's Friday.  It's a good day to eat French fries.  Ah, Friday.  I get it.  I see.  Oh, Chip, you're incorrigible.  I see Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve.  Who, by the way, we were just commenting on how the impression of Dr. Steve has degenerated 
[00:58:00]  to just a sound now.  A vocal chord like that.  Ah.  Yes.  Was Danny not able to do that, Travis?  What happened?  Is that what was happening?  What did you think Danny did do?  Oh, you were doing it just fine.  Ah.  Ah.  I want to thank Dr. Steve for giving me a birthday gift.  What did he give you?  A bottle of wine.  Ah.  People got confused.  They thought it was his home brew. 
[00:58:30]  Fuck that.  He's not that stupid.  Oh.  Oh.  He got a real bottle of wine for you?  It was called, it's called High Roller.  High Roller.  Or High Rollers.  It's a Cabernet.  Never heard of this.  Cabernet Sauvignon.  So I quickly, oh, you can just go to my Twitter, because I, no, I went and checked out the  price, and that's how I tweeted my thank you to Dr. Steve.  Oh, really?  I wrote, Dr. Steve gave me a nice birthday gift, and then it's a picture, and then you 
[00:59:00]  see the bottle of wine, and then right next to it is my computer screen on wine.com, trying  to figure out how much it was.  How much, oh, there it is.  Oh, look at the bottle with the big happy birthday.  That's a cool looking bottle.  Yeah, it has a chip on it, because, you know, High Rollers, oh, fuck, did I just do that?  I did not just do that.  You fucking did.  Did I just do that?  Yes.  I did not just do that.  I think I did it.  Fuck me.  I deserve it.  The glass is molded around what appears to be a casino token.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  A casino circle.  Yes, it represents money.  And if you, you know, you zoom in on the picture that I did tweet yesterday, it passed criteria.  Oh, it did.  The wine passed criteria.  High roller.  It's a $67 bottle of wine.  You can get it online.  And which means...  In a restaurant?  Retail, out, yeah.  In a restaurant, it's pushing $150.  Right, right.  So thank you to Dr. Steve.  Well, that's nice.  How fucking obnoxious is that, really? 
[01:00:00]  It really is, with that big fucking...  No, I mean that I had to look it up.  No, no, I know.  Yeah, you, well, you gotta look up the wine.  You have to.  You gotta see what's good, what's bad.  I love a good wine.  Nice wine.  You want to talk about how we're just being fucking raked over the coals again?  Oh, the gas thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, I did...  I mean, this is amazing.  I guess Kenny was doing you a favor yesterday and filled up your Escalade, right? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, sometimes I fucking...  I'm driving, and I don't even realize, and I hear boom, boom in the Escalade, and I go,  what the fuck is that?  And I look down and say, oh, my gas cage.  Which is the worst sound to hear when you're driving in Manhattan, because you gotta explain  for the people that don't live anywhere near Manhattan, there's no gas stations.  I think there's like four, and they're way on the outskirts, in the middle of an area  they don't mind if the damn thing blows up.  If it blows up, exactly.  That's what that's about.  They don't have them anywhere of importance. 
[01:01:00]  It's always just pushed out to the side.  West Side Highway, yeah.  A couple on the east side.  But, yeah, so when you're in Midtown, and you're running low on gas in this traffic,  you're just fucked.  You could easily run out of gas.  Oh, yeah.  Which probably surprised a lot of people, but I'm telling you, they just decided there's  some kind of law that if it is a gas station, way on the outskirts, and they don't  allow too many of them.  Yeah.  So yesterday, as a matter of fact, I was driving in, and I heard the boom-boom when  I was on the Northern State Parkway.  Oh, shit. 
[01:01:30]  And I'm like, fuck, now, I still got to drive in.  I'm not sure if, you know, if there's going to be traffic.  So I had to do a pit stop.  I pulled onto that median gas station that's on Northern State, and left the vehicle running,  jumped out, slid the credit card, beep, beep, beep, beep, quick with the fucking zip  code, pumped in, like, maybe five gallons.  And then, boom, shot back out into the fast lane.  It had to be a two-minute stop.  A pit stop.  It was a fucking pit stop. 
[01:02:00]  Why only $5?  Because I understand you didn't want to sit there and fill up the whole fucking thing.  I was already running late, and I didn't want to come in here, like, just as the show started.  So I just did enough.  And then Kenny, being the very vigilant man that he is, noticed that my gas was a little  low, and he topped my tank off.  And when he did that, he was talking to the gas station attendant, because Kenny will talk  to anybody, it seems.  How do you get into these conversations with a gas station attendant? 
[01:02:30]  I'm a little perplexed.  I'm very charming, and I'm a people person.  Is that what he is?  He sure is.  A people person.  And very efficient.  I don't even believe the person part.  So, now, this gas station attendant, I guess, was reprimanding you.  Yeah, that's how the whole thing started.  Yeah.  He yelled at me, because I didn't shut the engine of the truck.  Was he concerned about any flames from your dry hair? 
[01:03:00]  I could just burst into flames at the gas station, Jimmy, right?  Absolutely could.  Too much static electricity.  Did you run a comb through that?  But another, that old gag, they think that, what, your car or the gas station is going  to blow up?  It's going to blow up, yeah.  But didn't Mythbusters try that?  It's impossible?  It's an old wise tale.  I think if you have sparks shooting out of the fucking exhaust pipe, and your gas is spilling 
[01:03:30]  down the side of the car and hitting the exhaust, I don't know.  It can probably be done, but there...  It's almost impossible.  Yeah.  I think it's more possible if you get a static electricity spark on your finger, which is  impossible.  But...  Why are old wives so stupid?  Old wives.  Did I say wives?  No, no.  Old wives.  You're right.  Old wives are just dumb.  Old wives tale.  And cell phones, by the way, just do not do anything at a gas station. 
[01:04:00]  You could fucking shove the cell phone down your gas...  Tank.  Tank.  What's the tube?  The fill tube.  And call it.  What about matches?  Matches?  No, you can flick them and throw them right in there.  A horse's ass and you.  Look at the kid.  He gets all happy.  He really does.  Yeah, what about matches?  I think matches might do something.  So anyway, he talked to this guy. 
[01:04:30]  Because he got yelled at because he didn't turn off your car while he was filling up your  Escalade.  And apparently there is a fine if you keep your car running.  Yeah, he told me it's a $125 ticket for not only the gas pumper, but for the owner  of the vehicle also.  They both get the ticket.  They both get the...  And who's got to catch him?  A cop?  I guess it's a fire department regulation because it's a fire department license.  So you're going to get a ticket from the fire department.  So basically, they figured out how to get more money from us. 
[01:05:00]  That's exactly it.  But it doesn't end there.  Kenny was informed of a license that is necessary to pump gas in New York City.  You need a license.  You can't just...  If you're just some schlep and you want to go pump gas at a gas station there and make  some money, you have to have a license.  And listen to what they call it.  You've got to take a test.  Of course.  And if you pass the test, you then have to pay them $25 and a $15 renewal fee. 
[01:05:30]  And I guess...  I'm not sure what the expiration is on this.  How long it lasts.  About two years.  Two years?  I would think.  And here's what the title is.  Examination for the Certificate of Fitness for Motor Fuel Dispensing.  Motor Fuel Dispensing.  Ugh.  What a fucking...  Face.  Stump.  Ugh.  Fitness for Motor Fuel Dispensing. 
[01:06:00]  You take a test.  It's a written test.  It's Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 2.30 p.m.  So it's real convenient.  No, it's not.  What asshole came up with this?  Someone that just wanted to drain people that don't make any money of more money.  Applicants, you've got to be 18 years of age.  Applicant must have a reasonable understanding of the English language.  They don't say how to speak English.  A reasonable understanding.  Just enough English to understand, give us $25. 
[01:06:30]  Applicant must present a letter of recommendation from his or her employer.  The letter must be on official letterhead and must state the applicant's full name, character,  physical condition, experience, and address of premises where applicant will be employed.  Are you kidding?  Physical condition?  Character?  What type of character do you need to pump fucking gas?  Gotta have a crystal meth habit. 
[01:07:00]  They came up with shit.  Or be nice to your camel.  Get it?  Because they're all, you know.  If only people could see...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  If only people could see how Kenny sat up straight.  Yes.  Excitedly.  All excited.  Like a giraffe.  Very excited.  You know what it is, though?  They had to come up with stuff.  They couldn't just say, here, we can't even have enough...  We don't even have enough questions.  We have to come up with other things.  How about we make them get a letter that says it's physical condition?  Fucking assholes.  Because it's a fitness for motor fuel dispensing. 
[01:07:30]  What happens if you're too weak and the pump falls out of your hand?  Oh, you're not strong enough.  That must be it.  So they felt guilty instead of going, look, we need $25 from you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a shakedown.  So they came up with a reason.  Instead of a shakedown, now it's all official.  It's official.  It's a fucking shakedown by our politicians.  The test is multiple choice.  A passing score of at least 70 is required to secure that certificate of fitness. 
[01:08:00]  Do we have the test?  By the way, there are some sample questions.  Oh, perfect.  The study material.  This study material.  Oh, we got the study material.  There's a booklet with a study material.  Eleven pages.  Eleven pages of bullshit.  Wow.  Dispensing gasoline-approved containers.  You've got to know about all this shit. 
[01:08:30]  You can't just go pumping gas like everybody has done for years and years.  Although, these questions are a little tough.  I've got to say, and I'm not even kidding.  The pumps used to transfer gas from underground tanks must be approved by the A.  At the ground gas tank pump guy who runs it.  That is correct.  Thanks.  I was going to do this.  This is one of those wasteful questions.  Why would it matter? 
[01:09:00]  Right.  Why would it matter?  That has nothing to do with the guy that's pumping the gas.  With the guy pumping the gas.  Now, I've got to understand, maybe the owner needs to know this shit.  That's a separate license to have a gas station.  Well, yeah, I understand why you have to have a license to own the gas station.  But they should be the only ones that need to know who the pumps are approved by.  Why would that matter?  If a guy's pumping...  He's pumping.  A.  New York Fire Department.  B.  Board of Standards and Appeals.  Yes, I am.  C. 
[01:09:30]  Department of Buildings.  Or D.  Department of Electricity.  A.  New York Fire Department.  Jimmy?  Um, I say it's, uh, L.  Department of Gas.  The correct answer is B.  The Board of Standards and Appeals.  All right, whatever.  And if you notice, that little tag is on the pump.  Because you do just read the pump every time you're there.  And it does say, Standard of Appeals.  It looks like a little inspection sticker. 
[01:10:00]  You read it.  I do read it.  I wouldn't know there were words there if you made me say it at gunpoint.  I read Octane Levels.  I know it all.  Uh, the gasoline storage tanks must be A.  Underground only.  B.  Above ground only.  C.  Either above ground or underground.  D.  Easily moved in case of emergency.  Let me, let me, uh, once again say, why does the guy who's pumping your gas have to know that?  Have to know where the tanks...  They just have to be fucking assholes at every turn. 
[01:10:30]  How to fucking...  I just go with the underground thing.  You can't move an underground tank easily, so...  Uh, the answer...  I know the answer.  Yeah.  It's J next to the M&M vending machines.  Oh, Chip.  You are just a card.  That's right.  And to the teachers out there, stop being cunty with the, uh, A, B, is it A and B?  I don't like that one.  I used to fucking hate that shit.  Look, look, I know one of these things.  Because it's either, you know, you know the info and then they try to trick you. 
[01:11:00]  They trick you.  Yeah.  That's bullshit.  Don't try to trick me.  They're using that as a cunt.  They don't want you...  You know what it is on multiple choice.  They don't want you to guess the choice?  Multiple.  Multiple.  That's how I said it.  Multiple.  I've always had a weird way of saying that word.  I hate multiple choice.  Multiple.  I can't say it.  Multiple.  Was there anything worse when it said A, A and B, B and C, all of the above?  Oh, God.  Your fucking brain would explode in class, right?  Oh, God.  Yes.  It would explode.  Fucking annoying.  Yeah.  But go ahead. 
[01:11:30]  Uh, well, the correct answer is C, either above ground or underground.  Now, again, you're pumping gas at a fucking gas station.  Your life is a nightmare.  Why the fuck do you need to know that?  And pay 25 bucks.  Yeah.  I would love to get a...  It's a politician, obviously, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  I would love to get one.  I would love to get a guy on the phone to explain this bullshit.  It's a waste of time.  I have the whole list of licenses you need to, like, do things in the city. 
[01:12:00]  To do things.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  18 pages.  18 pages of licenses to do things.  All right.  Kenny's going to read off the list as fast as possible after this.  Go ahead.  Uh, Anthony.  Um, oh, Kenny's, uh, reading those off?  No, after, after you're done, man.  Oh, I was, um, going through all, uh, inspection.  Yeah.  Self-service stations.  In these service stations, the customers pump, uh, fuel into their own fuel tanks.  Although he does not pump the fuel for the customer, a certificate of fitness holder must be on premises while the self-service station is open for business. 
[01:12:30]  So that means, that means, that means you don't need a fucking thing to pump gas at a self-serve thing.  They are such scumbags.  Right.  They're shaking you down for, for, for 25 hours.  It could be a complete self-serve station.  The guy that works there to take your money needs to have this certificate of fitness to pump gas, even though he's never touching the fucking thing. 
[01:13:00]  And they're all, the only reason they're shaking us down for more money is because they, they can't figure out what to do with all the money that we give them already.  Yeah.  How about you don't forgive a billion dollars to Egypt?  Exactly.  And then you won't have to be, you know, shaking us down.  Fuck guys, it makes no money.  Well, the certificate.  $10 here, $20 there.  The certificate of fitness holder should also know how to operate the fire extinguisher system for the fuel pumps and, uh, how to turn on and off the pumps.  Shut the pumps, Hap.  Shut the pumps off, Hap.  What's that from?  I know what it's from.  Um.  Happy days. 
[01:13:30]  Happy days.  Give him a bell.  Shut the pumps off, Hap.  Pumps off, Hap.  That was the stand.  Oh, I've never known that.  When the sick guy was.  Was, is that when, uh.  The first guy.  The walking dude.  Champion or Champagne.  And what was the woman's name?  Or his name was.  Mother something.  Mother Abigail.  Mother Abigail.  Oh, Stephen can have had to put a friggin' old black wise woman in the thing.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Why don't you come and see Mother Abigail? 
[01:14:00]  Bring all your friends with ya.  You gotta hurry, Stu.  Bring all your friends.  Shut up.  You didn't like the walking dude?  Was I throwing the N-word out watching that?  Oh, God.  Was I throwing it out at the house?  Like a maniac.  Was it annoying you?  Shut this old bitch up, I'd say.  Oh, it was so annoying.  I didn't like the name.  The walking dude.  The walking dude. 
[01:14:30]  Captain Trips.  That movie stunk on ice.  Of course it did.  The fucking book was good.  Movie.  Stunk.  Not so good.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A fire extinguisher device thing.  And then they have a picture of a fire extinguisher and how to use it.  I didn't like this, Dan.  I thought it was about music.  That's a boring movie, really.  I thought there was something about a guy selling lemonade.  I'm a fan.  It's about someone who used to sit.  I could just keep going.  It's riffing.  It's pretty much it.  It's just the fact that they need a reason to shake down these guys that are just working 
[01:15:00]  at a gas station.  Because in the end, me and you, just a bunch of dummies, are filling up our gas tank.  Yeah, we do it ourselves.  So in the end, it's not even safety.  No.  Because what the fuck do we know?  We don't know shit.  We leave the car running.  We fucking pump the gas.  And I'll pry anything into that thing so I can sit in my car on a cold day.  Do you?  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's highly illegal.  Well, too bad.  I bet there's a big fine for that one.  Yeah, well, fucking catch me.  I like actually putting a lit Bunsen burner in there to hold the handle. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I like to warm my hands under a Bunsen burner.  Yes, while I'm pumping the gas.  Right next to the gas tank.  I light a little fire.  I take a...  Well, you got it.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to take a little, some kindling.  Sure.  And start it right by where you're pumping the gas in the winter.  Usually right near your feet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Keep your tootsies warm.  Of course.  Fucking assholes.  I think I hate getting a little bit of gas on your hand when you're pumping gas.  I would always pump with holding a paper towel.  I would get any contacts for so many years that I would always want to rub my eyes. 
[01:16:00]  Afterwards?  Yeah.  I'm always putting my fingers in my eyes.  I would get like the smell of gas on my hand.  I kind of like the smell of gas.  But then as you're driving, all you're doing is holding your fingers up to your nose and  smelling like you did when you were 16 and got your first piece of pussy.  Yeah, and the gas smells better.  Just a little bit, a little dribble on your fingers as you're driving down the New Jersey  Turpike.  I don't mind it.  Yeah.  It smells nice.  It'll wear off.  If you're going somewhere quickly, though.  I don't like smoking, but I like the smell of a cigarette every once in a while.  It's got to be the right consistency. 
[01:16:30]  I love the smell of pot, even though I don't smoke pot.  Great.  What else?  I don't like cocaine, but I like the smell of it.  I'll tell you what I don't like the sound of.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  And a slight smell of skunk as you're driving in the country.  Slight, not bad.  Right, right.  Believe it or not, not bad.  You're like, there's something, you know, kind of a country feel about the scent.  What about a slight smell of rancid pussy, though?  Just a slight smell of fucking rancid, rank vagina is quite enticing. 
[01:17:00]  What about a slight smell of your own asshole?  No.  You never want that.  Yes, you do.  Really?  I love the smell of my own asshole.  No.  Like, I want it to have such a nice flair that when I have jeans on in the house, somebody  in the next room goes, what is that?  I thought higher hopes for that joke.  Too wordy.  What about a slight smell of your own rotting tooth? 
[01:17:30]  No.  No.  That's awful.  How about the smell of a bad cough phlegm?  Oh, God damn it.  Just a little whiff.  How about when your mouth is dry, you take your pinky and you scrape the back of your  tongue and then sniff it.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  That is really bad.  That reeks.  See, there you go, Rob.  Fuck, you just gave me a great idea.  Opie, I keep a pinky handball in the car and use it to keep the pump going. 
[01:18:00]  Ah, that is a great idea.  Pink handball.  Because I'm always using one of those pink handballs.  Yeah.  Okay, you put it in there.  Fucking brilliant.  Yeah?  I'm getting one tomorrow.  Yeah, that is good.  So I usually do the gas cap thing kind of sideways.  I just use a zip strip and then I throw the fucking pump head on the ground and drive away.  And yell, clean it up!  Yeah, and just leave gas spewing out of it.  Yeah, but to go to a strip club that's just named after the grip dancers is just inappropriate. 
[01:18:30]  No, you did not.  Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  I did.  I meant it.  That's fantastic.  Kenny, you got a list of licenses?  Yes.  Yeah.  And they all start with certificate of fitness.  Oh, so now, because they say you have to be fit enough to do this.  Right.  Or be fit to perform this duty.  Right. 
[01:19:00]  Uh-huh.  What are they?  Fit what?  Who did Patrice O'Neill's website?  Let me see it.  That looks pretty good.  Travis, turn that a little bit.  Thanks.  I like that.  That stinks.  No, that's good.  It's got a good picture.  It's got a New York background kind of fucking blurred in the background.  My favorite part is Patrice is squinting into the sun.  Yes.  In that picture.  That is good.  That is good.  That's fucking, it's got his dates on there.  It's got like fucking.  And it covers the whole page, which I like. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Find out who did his web page.  I need one.  Because I need one.  And that looks like a really good one.  I should get the exact same design he has.  Oh, would that annoy him?  You know what?  Same picture.  Everything.  Exact same photo.  I'd be so mad.  With a hat.  But I don't wear hats and jackets.  I'm sorry, Kenny.  That's right, Kenny.  We were just distracted by a great website from Patrice O'Neal.  That's right.  A great website for a mediocre man. 
[01:20:00]  This guy, Donnie, really quick.  Donnie?  Go ahead, Donnie.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I was coming back from the Jersey Shore about a couple years back.  And I stopped on the Garden State to get gas.  And I poked to the pumps.  There's this good chick about 19 years old, seven months pregnant, pumping gas.  Yeah, you're not allowed to pump your own gas in Jersey, so.  Yeah, and I'm looking at her like that.  What are you doing?  Yeah, that might be a safety concern for her.  Why?  She's not pumping it into her pussy. 
[01:20:30]  Now that would be something.  I could see if she had one nozzle in the mouth and one in the vagina, and she was like,  just fill me.  That'd be a problem.  The kid would probably get sick.  This guy's going to explain the law.  He's going to say goodbye in the normal line.  Bill in New York.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, hello.  Hey, listen.  I'll tell you what.  Thanks for calling before you become a law.  Okay, thanks.  Jesus, you cannot just do that.  You are really on fire, as I wish you were.  I should be.  I didn't go to sleep. 
[01:21:00]  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Bill.  I'm sorry.  It's okay now?  Yeah, sorry.  All right, good.  Worked in a service station back in the 70s.  Why aren't you hot shit?  Are you done now?  With his big mustache.  Go ahead, Bill.  I'm sideburns.  I apologize.  All right, fine.  Yeah.  And this is when I first started with the self-serve.  And they had the automatic pumps.  And the lady comes in and pays for the gas. 
[01:21:30]  And she pays for it and leaves.  And I'm looking down at this register and it's flying.  The numbers are flying.  I can't figure out why.  Well, because she pulled off with a goddamn nozzle in the thing.  Yeah, people used to do that all the time.  Oh, it was on the way.  I don't know why they don't do it as much anymore.  How far did she drag the whole gas station?  Boom.  I had to take her name off the car and call her up and tell her to bring back the hose.  Oh.  It was just hanging out of the...  Yeah, it's cool.  Was she pulling a small church behind her? 
[01:22:00]  Like in the jerk?  I was terrible.  All right.  Check it out.  That guy had to delve back to the 70s to have such a compelling story to tell.  Do you realize his story is 40 years old almost?  And he said one time a lady had the pump fall.  Yes.  Do you know how many times...  I want you to look back on your life, sir.  And I want you to realize how many times you've been at a party holding a glass.  And you start that story, and you all of a sudden realize there's nobody around me anymore. 
[01:22:30]  Do you know how many fucking times he's had like one too many martinis and like tried to captivate people?  It was back.  It was 1977.  And the numbers are going and they're going and they're going because you know if he's losing people.  And she's, you know, we're doing a self-serve and the numbers, I'm just seeing him go.  You know, I'm aware.  A ride with your dumb gas pump story.  But he notices people's eyes shifting away, so he tries to rope them back in so they don't miss the end of the story. 
[01:23:00]  They're looking around for somebody else to talk to.  You know, anything else to look at.  Oh, a drink, something.  Is there a fern plant we could stare at?  A fern plant.  Perhaps a fucking bowl of Tostitos, even though it's the 70s and they're not around yet.  How about a bowl of Doritos?  Yes.  Some cheese doodles.  Yes, cheese doodles.  Does he?  It's a wire joke.  Yes.  Kenny?  Yes, sir.  Probably not.  Doodles with his brains. 
[01:23:30]  What the fuck you do that for?  What the fuck you do that for?  Go ahead, sentimental.  Kenny, let's do this.  Kenny, so what is this now?  They all start with Certificate of Fitness.  Yes.  Supervision of aerosol.  Supervision for LNG plants.  I guess that's liquid nitrogen.  What is supervision of aerosol?  You need a license for that now?  Yeah, it's a huff, I guess.  What are you doing with aerosols?  Who has to get a license to have aerosol?  Is that like, you know, or if you carry it in your establishment? 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  Supervision non-production chemical laboratories.  Supervision of chemical laboratories.  Okay.  Supervision of fireproofing.  Oh.  Supervision of spray painting.  Oh, that's a little stupid.  These are all licenses you got.  Yeah.  Supervision bulk acid storage.  Well, I would think you would need a license for that.  Some are legit.  I'm going to give them the storing acid.  Yeah.  I kind of want somebody to maybe take a test when they're storing acid. 
[01:24:30]  You know how many Tupperwares have things I've damaged trying to store my acid?  I have nowhere to put it.  I wrap it up in pillowcases.  Pillowcases.  Pillow.  Pillow.  Pillowcases.  Acid storage is a big one.  Yes.  In most of our lives.  What else?  I'm thinking gas stations and repair shops where this would be very expensive if it's $25 for each one of these.  It starts adding up.  Hazard miss materials.  Hazard miss material.  Yeah.  Hazard miss.  Yeah, rightfully so.  It's a woman with a fucking herpetic vagina. 
[01:25:00]  Hazard miss.  Hazard miss.  Supervise wholesale drugstores, drug, and chemical supply houses.  All right.  Manufacture of combustible materials and mixtures.  I don't like the fact that Kenny's suit is the same color as Jaws.  What?  Where do you get these colors?  That is a gray suit.  It really is.  That is shark belly gray.  Oh, it's awful.  Fucking fabric from a battleship.  That's very bothersome. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, she's pretty.  Big in that?  Juice just walked by.  She's a ten of them, Jeff.  She's an ebony princess that works across the hall.  Hello, my Nubian queen.  Yes.  We came from kings and queens.  We built pyramids and flying pyramids.  We were all right.  Hello, my Nubian princess.  Invented peanut butter.  Deal with it.  Can I offer you some money to put my alabaster penis by your mouth? 
[01:26:00]  It's been a big drop-off since those days.  I wouldn't be bragging about that.  No.  Really?  Exactly.  Peanut butter.  It's basically one of the fucking fat women in the house stepped on a peanut.  Right.  And you licked it off her foot.  Off what George Washington Carver cares about him.  Had him.  What else did he invent?  Nothing.  Love the peanut, that guy.  Love the peanut.  Peanut butter and the cumsicle.  He had one really great invention and the rest were terrible.  Who wasn't inventing peanut butter? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, I know.  Take peanuts.  But when you chew peanuts up, it's pretty much peanut butter in your mouth before you swallow it.  Exactly.  That's all you got to do.  Peanut vomit.  He fucking put peanuts in his mouth, chewed them up, spit them into a jar, and gave it  to white people.  That's an eagle fucking...  That's their payback?  Put it on a cracker.  Yeah.  That's how they're secretly making their peanut butter in the peanut butter factories.  Yes.  Whitey just doesn't know it yet.  George Washington Carver.  Are we done there, Kenny?  I'm only on page two.  Did we make our point, though? 
[01:27:00]  I think our point was...  Actually, though, everyone he's read is like, I could see needing some type of certification  for that.  License to fly aircraft to drive motor vehicles.  What a waste.  Yeah.  We probably should have had someone go over them and see the crazy ones.  And circle the bad ones.  Yeah.  Well, here.  A supervised technical establishment.  What is that?  What is that?  I don't know.  That doesn't mean it's not legit, just because we don't know what it is.  We don't know.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough. 
[01:27:30]  But it's technical.  Look, a doctor.  Fitness for magazine keeper.  No.  It's probably in guns.  Oh, right.  Magazine.  Okay.  Not...  I was thinking magazine, and then it's like some type of magazine, some kind of loading  thing.  Maybe not even guns.  Not ladies' home journal.  Yeah.  It could be a magazine.  Highlights.  Right.  Go for some gallons.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Highlights.  Goofus was always making mistakes.  Yeah.  Sure.  He had to be taught a lesson. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because Gallant throws the underwear with the cum in the back and the hamper.  Goofus wears it again.  Goofus has a problem.  Yeah.  Always has a problem.  Goofus bosses his friends.  Goofus has great hair.  Yeah.  His Potsy Weber hair.  Gallant asks, what do you want to do next?  And then the bottom one says, Goofus takes the last apple.  Gallant shares his orange.  Aw.  Gallant's a jizz bag.  Gallant's a fruit.  Goofus rules.  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  Goofus is going to get ahead in life.  We all want to be Goofus, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But unfortunately, society says we have to be Gallant.  Gallant washes his hands after a fingering.  Goofus wipes them on his friend's mustache.  That's fantastic.  Gallant helps his blind friend into her home.  Goofus leaves a plunger with itching powder on it in the toilet.  Gallant just seems like a pain in the ass to set up. 
[01:29:00]  Literally, yes.  Yes.  Gallant props up the invalid's head with a pillow to make her more comfortable.  Goofus farts into her open mouth.  She lays there stupidly.  Why do they come up with such lame names?  Goofus and Gallant.  It was way back in the day.  I've never come across one Goofus or one Gallant.  We find another one.  Don't be a Goofus.  Be a Gallant.  Yeah, there we go. 
[01:29:30]  Let's see what...  Well, they've illustrated Goofus and Gallant different.  Goofus, he's saying,  Here, sew this button on.  I guess to his mom or...  With the woman who's been having sex with his giant Goofus cock.  It's an older woman who likes his young but fat Goofus cock in her mouth and ass.  Fill me with Goofus cum.  Gallant preps the bowl with his mouth. 
[01:30:00]  Goofus fucks the ass of the wife.  Holy shit.  What's wrong with the button one?  It is the 50s.  The button fell off.  That's how you talk to your mom back then.  But he's being mean.  He's saying, Here, sew this button on.  That's what you told a broad.  Hey, bitch.  You can't see the cartoon.  She's laying on her back crying and he's pissing on her face.  And there's a sewing needle in her clit.  In her clit.  And she was darning the husband's socks to where he gets home and lays one into her eye. 
[01:30:30]  And Goofus said, Here, sew this button on.  And then I'm necessarily, Jew, bitch.  That's not necessarily...  Oh, would he say that?  And Gallant says, Will you please sew on this button?  And Gallant has his hand around the old woman's neck and he's cupping her tit with his left hand.  It kind of looks like that.  And it's more a grandmotherly thing that he's asking.  They are Gallant.  Not Goofus who's asking the young, hot milf from the 50s.  Goofus, I want to read the funnies. 
[01:31:00]  Because the woman is holding a newspaper, but the dumb baby maker is holding it upside down because she's looking for a fucking comforter, Ed.  Goofus wants to have some laughs.  And by the funnies, he means Nazi propaganda.  I want to read that funny cartoon with the mustache and the giant nose attached to it.  And Gallant says to the older gentleman next door who's molesting him,  Are you finished with the funnies? 
[01:31:30]  And why are those kids doing that with those adults in these funnies?  Can we watch cartoons with Arnold and Dudley?  Now this one is Goofus is sitting there with some playing cards.  And that cunty old woman is sitting there.  It's fucking Dagwood Bumstead's wife.  Blondie.  Blondie.  Blondie.  And Goofus says, let me see it.  And he's snatching away a card.  Her panties.  He's pulling her panties down.  He wants to see her vagina.  Her big 50s hairy muff. 
[01:32:00]  Because there's four cats have been at her ankles looking up meowing.  So Goofus thinks that her vagina is smelling up the house.  And Gallant, looking at the older woman, says, may I see it?  Yes, he's asking nicely.  May I see it?  Yeah.  And she pulls it down, showing her meaty, juicy pussy, taint and asshole.  Yes.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Wow.  That's a different...  How many are there?  3,478. 
[01:32:30]  You know.  Sure, their hair was messy.  Each one is animated completely different, though.  Yeah, they're like drawn by different people.  We, uh...  Over the years, this is more of a 60s, 70s look to it.  We should break, though, because we got Dr. Steve and a whole office full of people that  want to come in and say hi, right?  We're going to get really fucking busy here, huh?  How annoying is that? 
[01:33:00]  Holy shit.  We're going to catch up with Dr. Steve, Big A, Bobo, Stalker, Patty next.  Bill Burr should be here in minutes.  Oh, he's here, so we'll bring him in.  My new TV girlfriend, by the way, is the red-headed daughter on the Safelite Repair commercial.  Have you seen her?  She chips the windshield.  What's that?  And it's like, oh, shit.  And the Safelite Repair guy comes and he puts the resin in the windshield and she's all 
[01:33:30]  like standing there and shit.  I think she's hot.  How old is she?  I don't know, but I think she's hot.  So she's probably really funny, too, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Like Jenna Marbles.  Jenna Marbles.  I like the Safelite Repair girl.  I like Jenna Marbles' tits.  Who's hot?  Is the Safelite Repair girl hotter than the Volkswagen girl?  No.  Not as hot.  Different type.  The Volkswagen girl looks like that blonde one, right, you're talking about?  She looks like she's taking that Volkswagen out, not even going down the block before she's 
[01:34:00]  got a cock in her.  This red-headed girl looks like, you know, you've got to take her out.  She's a little innocent, kind of like, ooh.  Daddy, I broke the windshield.  What should I do?  And he says, suck Anthony's cock.  Because she's got her.  Do we have it?  Or should we give her left to the break?  No.  It might be.  Yeah, yeah, her.  Look at her.  No, look, she's driving.  She's old enough.  And then she's like, Dad, look, I chipped my windshield.  So they scheduled online.  And look at them. 
[01:34:30]  Right?  So the young Frankenstein helps her.  Who is that creep?  I know.  The father really grows longer.  Yeah.  Or stays stronger.  There's even a national lifetime warranty.  Plus, thanks to his insurance.  And he waves off the money.  No.  No.  He's waving at the wallet.  Say goodbye to this, scumbag.  Thanks.  That's all.  She can't be more than 17.  Yeah.  She's playing about a 17-year-old.  Yeah, she's like 17.  What?  By the way, worst computer graphic ever is the chipped windshield. 
[01:35:00]  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, look.  And he's looking at the windshield.  Oh, I see the chip.  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, look, she's still driving.  It's still there.  She was driving through Palestine, and they were throwing rocks in her car.  That's what happened.  She's a Dubrow.  I just think it's...  Fucking Dubrow gets that cracked windshield.  All right, we got a break, and then this studio's going to be very full when we get back.  So, stay there. 
[01:35:30]  The virus.  Virus.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Bill Burr in studio.  Yeah.  Roland went to the show last night saying, sold out.  Standing room only.  That was a good time.  Yeah.  He said you killed.  He said Stephen Wright was there. 
[01:36:00]  Yes, he was.  Got to talk to him.  A legend.  He really is a legend.  Yeah.  Very, very nice guy.  He seemed to like your act, too.  Yeah.  Said some nice...  Oh, yeah.  And I was like a little schoolgirl.  Oh, were you?  I started in Boston, too.  Did he shake your hand?  He doesn't seem to like shaking hands.  No, no, no.  He did.  The fist bump, right?  He did the fist bump.  And, oh, yeah.  Comics are weirdos.  She said, what's up?  No, dude, I'm telling you, there's something after shaking all those hands after a while.  Oh, no.  I believe in that.  Purell makes more sense after every show.  People coming out, they're hammered. 
[01:36:30]  You know they don't wash their hands in the bathroom.  And there's always the guy with the...  You can tell he's got the sweaty hand.  He's even wiping it on his shirt because he knows and it's still.  He just grabs you.  He's just trying to get some of the sweat off.  Oh, it's like a clammy sponge.  It's true.  During the virus tour, when we used to have to shake a fucking shitload of hands and just have Purell right next to you.  It doesn't matter.  It just turns into mud on your hands.  Oh, it's horrible.  Disgusting.  No, I have Purell in my pocket right now.  You just got to start getting obsessed with it.  Just washing the crowd off of your hands.  It's just like... 
[01:37:00]  Constantly.  By the...  After shaking hands after a show, it's like you could run like neck and neck with like a hotel-like comforter.  There's a lot of germs on your hand.  Yeah.  As long as you don't touch your face, you're fine.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, you know, absolutely.  You don't think that shit can run right up your arm?  You know what's the worst is when you forget and then you go back to the green room and say,  Here's that order of mozzarella sticks.  And you eat like two of them and you're like,  Fuck!  I didn't wash my fucking hands.  You realize you're licking something off your fingers that wasn't the sauce you ate? 
[01:37:30]  Jesus.  That guy had an injury.  What a good show last night.  Is Sunday sold out?  Almost.  Just about.  Oh, all right.  So you still have a chance.  They've got a few 10.30 show on Sunday.  That's the only show that's still available.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  I came here to see you guys.  Ah.  Right?  And your Bruins won last night after all our bullshit yesterday.  I know.  And actually, I didn't see a second of the game because...  I saw a little bit of it.  I guess they got physical.  It was a great game, but I was too tired.  A little brawling?  Were they gooding it up a little bit? 
[01:38:00]  There was...  I think there was a fight in there.  I have no idea.  I went home, checked out NHL.com, so I just got a quick little highlights.  2-0.  Take a 2-1 series lead.  So much for me thinking the Lightning are going to win it all.  There's Stalker Patty.  There's Dr. Steve.  There's Bobo.  Who else?  Big A, who has lost a shitload of weight.  Did you see?  Patty's fucking...  The gravity is really just damaging what little there was there.  Like, she's getting pulled down in a... 
[01:38:30]  She's horrendous.  Like the fucking tub of the Shining Woman.  Yeah.  You know how it looked like...  Without that nice laugh.  Without the pleasant face.  Hey, uh...  Before we get Dr. Steve in, because Jimmy was all over this yesterday, remember that adult  baby we talked about?  Yeah, yeah.  He had...  It was on a documentary.  Yes.  Taboo, it was called.  I watched it.  I watched that documentary.  It was so creepy.  And there was a portion of that where I actually yelled out, are you fucking kidding me? 
[01:39:00]  And it was what this politician is angry about.  Right.  This guy is on the government till.  Right.  He's fucking...  What, an adult baby?  What is it?  It's a guy that lives his life dressed in diapers.  And she...  If that fucking...  Did you see that?  ...dumb son of a bitch keeps fucking waving.  Out of the corner of my...  I'm trying to kind of carry on a conversation.  This dumb motherfucker, Bobo, is outside the window.  Open the door.  Waving with two hands.  No, but is...  Did the shit stirrer do this? 
[01:39:30]  Who did that?  Was it Sam or is it Bobo on his own?  Who the fuck put him up to that?  Bobo, who fucking told you to wave at the air staff as we're trying to talk?  You look like you're waving in a fucking jet.  Don't come in.  Stay right there.  Why are you waving?  Who told you to wave?  Sam did.  Sam did.  Sam did.  Why don't you wave on the shit show?  The shit hour.  He's waving like he's bringing in a plane as we're trying to talk about the adult age. 
[01:40:00]  I was so distracting.  If I was in the Secret Service, that's the guy I would hone in on.  Guy in the Mets hat.  Guy in the Mets hat.  He's talking to your wrist.  Let's see your hands.  Let's see your hands, sir.  That would be...  Check out the guy in the Mets hat.  He's down there.  To the left.  Yeah, that guy.  Hands in the coat pocket.  Yeah.  Adult baby.  So, he lives his life like an adult baby.  He's got a full-size crib.  He builds his own stuff.  He is hateable.  He built a high chair. 
[01:40:30]  He built his own high chair.  He's a big, fat fuck.  Good for him.  Really?  Good for him.  Good for him.  Nobody wants to move out.  Don't you just want to just watch cartoons and eat donuts all day?  He's got this woman, this big slob lady that plays his mother for him and rubs his hair  and feeds him a bottle and he lays there in a diaper.  That's awesome.  Look at this fucking doll.  Oh, that looks great. 
[01:41:00]  Does he have feet pajamas, too?  Yeah, yeah.  I would love to do this.  You would love to do this.  Look how awesome that is.  Bill's got a whole other take on this.  Oh, how much fucking attention does this fat fuck need?  He was molested as a child, by the way.  So have some fucking sympathy, Jim, okay?  So is Scott Weiland.  Came out today.  Really?  I thought we might be getting him on the show. 
[01:41:30]  He's a cute little thing.  Scott Weiland raped at 12.  Wait a minute.  He holds himself an adult baby.  He spends half his life.  The other half, he actually has to go to work, right?  No, no, no.  That's just it.  We're paying for this, Bill.  People have disability.  As he drinks out of his Bob-Ock.  He's laughing.  He's drinking urine.  We drink that Bob-Ock.  Look at him.  Like they think that it's an automatic that you're a pedophile because you're into it.  Me, me, me.  Take care of me.  Nurture me.  Look at this fucking guy. 
[01:42:00]  He's drinking out of his Bob-Ock.  And she's rubbing his head.  Jesus.  What sort of adult gets that sort of attention?  The life of Riley he's living.  Dude, you're telling me you never seen like one kid when you're just tired, your feet fucking  hurt, and you just see some kid getting pushed down the street in a stroller, and you just  go, why didn't I enjoy that more?  Why didn't I enjoy that?  I took him for granted.  I appreciated that.  Yes.  Look at him.  He's playing with his Legos.  Laying on his fat stomach like a saddle.  We paid for those Legos, too.  Government assistance. 
[01:42:30]  He's in a playpen.  This is the guy you're outraged about?  He looks like Big A.  He's just awful.  Well, that's a pack-and-play.  A pack-and-play.  All right.  Yes.  Pack-and-play.  Spoon-fed.  Sorry.  Spoon-fed.  Then he eats like a little kid.  Yeah, he goes num-num-num.  And even wears a diaper.  That's a big thing.  He's having a bedtime story read to him.  I think our cultural norms tell us that we're supposed to...  Psychobabble, psychobabble. 
[01:43:00]  And then we grow up, and we go through teenage, and then we become adults, and then we become  adults, and then if somebody is trying to jump back, then that feels uncomfortable.  Playing with Legos, he's terrible.  Just built a big block out of it.  Of the argument.  Dummy.  When he wants to go to the bathroom, he's...  To avoid public shaming, Stanley switches to adult mode.  Oh, why?  Oh, why?  Yeah, exactly.  This afternoon, he's at a hardware store, buying wood for an upcoming DIY project.  We're paying for this shit? 
[01:43:30]  A supersized high chair.  Oh, this guy, this guy's a...  He's making a supersized high chair.  Yeah, good for him.  Now, here's the thing.  Could you pause that for a second?  Wait a minute.  You know, it's those fucking bankers.  You know, they got some goddamn eight-year-old building them a yacht.  You're going to get mad at this guy?  You know what?  He takes out of your check probably half a cent.  Look at the entertainment he's giving you.  He's just hateable.  Well, that's true.  He...  The problem is...  Did he go to DuPont to make a giant rattle?  Dude, DuPont.  Aren't they in plastics? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, of course.  The problem is, he's on disability, and they show him going to a Home Depot-type place, getting  wood.  He obviously can use tools and build things.  He's built himself a giant crib.  Sure.  And he's building a high chair.  So he can work.  Anthony, do you think this guy...  Hold on.  Do you want his life?  Do you think he's getting away with something here?  No.  Do you think...  Look at him.  That heart attack face he has.  Those rings under his eyes.  Like somebody did the old binoculars trick to him in the 1920s. 
[01:44:30]  Hey!  All right, listen.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Have you ever got any pussy?  Anything?  Oh, he's never getting pussy.  A hundred dollars if someone knocks those coffees out of that intern's hand.  She's carrying five fucking cups of coffee.  A hundred dollars.  A hundred dollars.  It wouldn't be worth the beating you'd get.  Come on.  You'd get a beating from everybody at Shade 45.  You would talk great body, man.  Remember back in the day when we used to scald innocent women?  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  I'm like, I don't think we've ever done that.  Dude, that's how shit...  No.  You're all going nuts.  You've got an even better camera.  Yeah, I've got a better camera.  You weren't even thinking about what you were asking us to do.  You're like, dude, this is going to be a bunch of hits.  Why not?  She was carrying five fucking hot cups of coffee.  Balanced.  Yeah.  One on top of the other.  She has parents who love her.  We don't want her to come with lobster hands to the skull.  Balanced.  Her Thanksgiving body is amazing.  She's making peeling off what she is.  Oh, what a fucking ass is.  Sorry.  We should have... 
[01:45:30]  We were in the same place getting breakfast, and she just commands all the attention wherever  she goes.  Did you talk to her?  No.  What am I going to talk to her about?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  Christ.  Look at that.  Let me tell you what I want.  Look at the ass on her.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Dude, why would you do that to her?  She's beautiful.  I open those ass cheeks, and I go...  I want to buy a timeshare in there.  Yeah.  Nice, right?  All right. 
[01:46:00]  Nice.  Jesus.  I just railed us for a bit.  That didn't work.  Fine.  So where were we with this guy?  We were talking about the adult baby who evidently is living the greatest life ever.  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm saying he is and he isn't.  Come on, dude.  This guy, he's going to die of a heart attack.  We all have a needy person in our lives, and this just brings it up to that level where  you just fucking get frustrated.  He should be on disability.  He's obviously capable of working.  He's a lump.  I think he should fucking get out there and get a job.  Does he sleep through the night yet? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  I would just...  You know, but there's a lot of funny shit in here.  The fact that he has to go into adult mode to avoid public shaming.  Oh, humiliation.  Those are the stories I want to know.  What?  What did people say?  Yeah, he should have a giant stroller that she wheels him around in.  That would be hilarious.  Then I would give him a little slack.  If he went out in public as this adult baby, then maybe I wouldn't be so harsh.  I want him to make an adult version of that little jumpy seat that babies have.  The crane. 
[01:47:00]  Bring him in.  I want more public shaming.  I would love to talk to him.  You know what we ought to do?  We ought to get him in for an interview and off because he needs money.  Right.  And fucking just...  From a couple of bucks.  Oh, no, yeah.  Just tell him...  We'll make him dress like a baby.  He's in some trouble now.  We'll make you an adult-sized teddy bear.  She's coming back.  She's coming back.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Look, Bill.  Oh, my Jesus.  I hate all this white-faced and kind of bouncy thing going on.  Here's the...  We're just talking about you. 
[01:47:30]  That's what I'm talking about.  Yes, you dirty little fucking whore.  All the thoughts of a guy.  Let's get back to this clip.  Let's get back to this clip.  The adult baby.  And then we're going to give you the update.  I wouldn't care.  He's picking out his wart for his high chair.  A little guy.  Stanley's already customized other baby furniture to make his fantasy life feel more real.  This is my nursery, and this is my crib. 
[01:48:00]  My nursery?  It took me about a day to build it and another day to paint it.  This particular side goes up and down, and the other one's stationary.  I like it.  That giant pocket TV.  You could stick a fucking iPad in there.  You fat-titted jackass.  Sleeping in the crib, you wake up as a child, and you can continue on from there.  It's easy to stay in the same mindset.  I got my hands on a baby-sized play yard. 
[01:48:30]  Please get in it.  Please get in it.  Didn't take much more than putting an inch-thick board in the bottom.  He reinforced it for his fat self.  Supporting 60 pounds to about 350 pounds.  I went out to the breezeway and removed all the screens.  Stanley knows many people might forgot his lifestyle.  Ordering on Insanity.  I love his fucking shorts and socks ensemble.  Borderlining on Insanity.  Look, he's fucking working.  He should be on a job site.  It's like Eddie...  Oh, he's sort of thinking you're crazy. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, the Eddie Trunk angle.  Because this isn't normal.  At least that's what you think.  And you think you're the only one that's doing it.  How much cum did he have to swallow?  Hopefully a lot.  When the baba wasn't ready.  He's claiming other people are doing it.  There's a few more out there.  It's a new sensation all the kids are doing it.  And then Stanley's lifestyle is infantilism.  He got in it.  Look at him.  He's in it.  Oh, he's adorable.  Gucci, Gucci, Gucci.  He's in his back of his fucking stubble fat chin. 
[01:49:30]  You know the producer said make him get in this.  He has to get in there.  Play with your toys.  Put the diapers on him.  A sexual fetish.  He's playing with his toy.  How boring.  What happens after five minutes?  Am I really going to play with this?  No, dude.  Something happened to this guy and he's blocking it all out.  He's just going back to when he was fucking two.  It gets on hold.  There you have it.  What a douche.  He's a hateable guy.  The update is he's going to kill himself if what?  They take away his benefits. 
[01:50:00]  They take away his benefits.  If his social security or his fucking money for doing nothing is stopped, he's threatening  to kill himself.  He's going to hang himself from the mobile above his crib.  I'm going to put cyanide in my baby formula if you guys don't.  So fucking hateable.  What the fuck?  He actually said he's going to kill himself.  Oh, yeah.  I read the quote.  He said, if I can find it.  I'm going to kill everybody who gets it.  That's like a little kid. 
[01:50:30]  Money.  Yeah.  I'm going to run away.  He's going to hold his breath until he dies.  He said, oh, I got it.  You want to test how damn serious I am about leaving this world?  Screw with my check that pays for this apartment and food.  Try it.  See how serious I am.  I don't care.  The California man said, I have no problem killing myself.  Take away the last thing.  Keep me here and see what happens.  Next time you see me on the news, it will be me and a body bag.  Oh, somebody needs a nap. 
[01:51:00]  Someone gets cranky around this time.  Oh, you're going to kill yourself.  Is that what you're going to do?  Nine people have to come up.  Throw him in that giant crib.  Take a nap.  He's acting like a baby, obviously, right?  Yeah, he really is.  That's like, fuck.  Quite literally.  What an asshole.  This is what?  Some senator questioned this whole thing?  After seeing this, how he's on disability.  When you see that he's on disability, I mean, people go on disability and are taken off of 
[01:51:30]  it for a lot less, this guy was able to get himself to the fucking store, buy some fucking  lumber, and make a goddamn project.  He's on the same thing as 9-11 respondents getting the same fucking treatment.  And they got him on leaving the house as a normal person.  Given that Mr. Thornton is able to determine what is appropriate attire and actions in  public, drive himself to complete errands, design, and custom-make baby furniture to  support a 350-pound adult, and run an internet support group, it is possible that he has 
[01:52:00]  been improperly collecting disability benefits.  This guy is a genius.  He's a genius.  He's just a fatty who doesn't want to work.  He's just committing to it.  He's really committing to the fucking...  Yeah.  I bet when they're not there, he's got a hockey jersey on.  He's got all the sports packages.  His life is the act!  Thank you.  The prestige.  Of course the prestige.  He's like...  Like that fucking Chinaman that holds the fish tank between his knees.  You know what I would love to do is dress Big A like a baby, too, and have them meet 
[01:52:30]  each other and have a play date.  A play date.  That would be great.  Big A just looking at him with that psycho look he always has as they both stare at the  same toy.  We have footage of Big A as a baby.  Do we?  Yes.  I think so.  I use it to promote Hit Your Guts.  Oh, right!  I don't know if it's out.  Dan, we don't know if that was.  Big A?  I've never seen it.  Can you check on YouTube or something?  Let's get Dr. Steven here.  Literally.  Let's bring him in.  Dr. Steven.  As we try to find that clip. 
[01:53:00]  Dr. Steven.  Yeah.  I want to hear your stalker, Patty.  Big A.  Oh, yeah.  I hit your guts promo or something?  We haven't seen her in quite a while.  Hi, guys.  She's going to be, hi, guys.  All happy and peppy.  Yes.  Stalker, Patty.  Dr. Steve.  There's Dr. Steve.  You can hear him on Weird Medicine.  Hi, Steve.  He does Weird Medicine.  Very soon at 10 p.m. on Saturday night.  10 p.m. Saturday night. 
[01:53:30]  I'm not sure when that starts.  So what about the fucking end of the world thing?  Are you going to interrupt with your show or anything?  I hope not.  If it happens, it would disturb the show, yes.  People have medical issues.  They want answered.  And if a rapture occurs, it's a waste of time then.  You got anything on?  My husband is just a pile of clothes now.  What is the cure for that?  He just disappeared.  Yeah.  Does Steve have anything on adult babies? 
[01:54:00]  Close.  Steve, do you know anything about adult babies and what that shit's about?  Yeah.  It's called...  I believe it's called hebephrenia and...  Hey, watch the fuck, man.  That's what Mike from...  Yeah.  It's...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  We all know you're a doctor.  That's when you're afraid of gay Jewish people.  Hebephrenia.  You hebephrenia son of a bitch.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's confusing it with niggerosis.  Wow, he almost fell over. 
[01:54:30]  We all know Dr. Steve's a doctor, so why have to wear the doctor thing?  That's called a stethoscope.  The doctor thing.  Well, they do that on TV to say, look, you're looking at a doctor.  But we already know you're a doctor.  No, we're doing a physical...  I don't know what we're doing today.  Yeah, we don't either.  We don't either.  We just like having you on, Dr. Steve.  That's right.  Well, we were...  You know, we...  Initially, we were going to do this proctopalooza thing.  Yeah.  What's that, like a big concert for all, like, proctologists?  I like that.  You didn't even do the chip voice.  No, I don't.  No, I should have. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Steve, adult babies.  What's that about?  Okay.  Yeah, you know what?  It's just all absurd.  Hold on.  Can you go back?  Sorry.  Andrew, just like a baby.  Message from Andrew.  I hate your guts by Jimmy Jordan.  Available in...  In...  In...  In...  In... 
[01:55:30]  In...  Oh, no.  In...  In...  In...  In...  In...  In...  In...  What now?  Oh, give Daddy a kiss.  Good night.  Good night.  He licks the cover of the book.  I hate your guts by Jim Norton.  How does that only have 7,000 hits? 
[01:56:00]  That's fucking hilarious.  How does that only have 7,000?  I don't know.  That's gotta...  That's gotta be a hybrid offshoot of...  That's hilarious.  Come on.  That shit.  Yeah.  Message from Baby Boy.  I hate your guts on YouTube.  That's hilarious.  It could probably use some...  A better title and some tags or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a little long.  Yeah, put Jim Norton in the title.  Jimmy Norton.  I hate your guts in quotes and then Jim Norton in Google and it comes up.  Oh, good.  YouTube, I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's the fourth one down if you like.  Oh.  It's hilarious.  His licks in the book is disgusting. 
[01:56:30]  Isn't it infantilism or something?  Yeah.  They call it that.  Yeah, and, you know, life itself is just absurd, so, you know, what the fuck?  You know, it's...  We're all gonna die and, you know, it's whatever it takes to get through this life and...  You have a wonderful bedside manner.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, this sounds like the green room doctor's talking.  And you got six months to live.  Okay, we'll see you later.  And then go to the back, too.  What the fuck?  I don't have any opinion about it.  It is disturbing to watch. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Why are you obsessed with that?  We went out to dinner last night, and the dinner conversation was, we're all gonna die.  I'm like, what are you...  Well, where are you enjoying ourselves?  He works at, like, a hospice.  He watches people drop down all the time.  His friend helps him with his fucking pillow with handlebars on it.  Angel of death, Steve.  I was setting him free.  Ah, no more suffering.  You're free, Ethel.  You're free.  He's, ah, I'm freeing people.  They want to know why all his patients have fucking, like, teeth marks on the inside of 
[01:57:30]  their lip.  Sure sign of smothering.  Sorry.  Hey, Dr. Steve, what do you want to do?  You want to start with Big A?  Last we saw Big A, he was close to death, right?  Let's be honest with each other.  Yeah.  Big A was in the hospital a few months ago with congestive heart failure.  Holy shit.  That's the big one.  You don't come back for that, usually.  Probably related to, well, I mean, probably.  It was related to his weight, but that was contributing to his sleep apnea. 
[01:58:00]  So he was living basically as an anaerobe.  What's an anaerobe?  An anaerobe is someone that lives without oxygen.  You know, so he was living at a very low oxygen level.  And what that does is, as the oxygen level in your lungs decreases, the arteries contract  in the lungs.  Oh, man.  Trying to shunt blood away to a place where there might be more oxygen.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't anywhere. 
[01:58:30]  It was all in both of his lungs.  So you get a pulmonary embolism?  Well, you get pulmonary hypertension.  Hypertension.  Ah.  It causes the resistance to flow in the lung to increase, and it's much harder for the  heart to pump through the lungs.  And now the heart starts acting like a pump that is overprimed, and it backs up.  His body was working like every car I had when I was in my teens.  Just barely fucking there.  Overheating.  Overheating. 
[01:59:00]  Wow.  You know, somebody said to me the other day, every extra pound you have on is an extra  five miles of capillaries.  Is that true?  That can't be right.  Well, I don't know if that...  I don't know the numbers.  But capillaries are amazing.  There's a...  It's...  The amount of surface area inside the capillaries is, like, it's astronomical.  Really?  It wouldn't be.  It's also where so many of the decisions are made and the votes are taken.  No, that's the capital.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Ooh.  I know.  I know.  Wow.  Before it came out, I went to... 
[01:59:30]  Did you forget how to do the chip knife?  No.  I just...  They're calling him Big Aorta now.  Big Aorta!  Tony C and Boston.  Oh, shit!  Dr. Steve, so then what happened?  So he was close to death, obviously.  Yeah.  Wow.  We were close to losing our own Big A?  I think we were admitting this for the first time on our show.  We were kind of talking around this, but now we're getting pretty honest.  Yeah, he got out of the hospital and had a change of life.  Yeah.  He's a woman now. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Amazing.  He's gorgeous.  Yeah, he stopped having his periods.  He's dating an adult baby.  No, he...  I've seen a lot of people turn their life around, but very few this dramatically.  Wow.  You know, he just got the fear of God and started eating right, using his CPAP mask.  We raised some money on our show and through some of your Twitter followers donated some  money because, you know, Big A has insurance, but he still can't afford health care. 
[02:00:30]  And, you know, just to walk into the gastroenterologist's office, because he had anemia on top of everything  else, they wanted 350 up front and his insurance, you know, wouldn't cover that.  Why would they cover it?  Was it his deductible?  Well, his insurance apparently only covers...  It's catastrophic.  You know, so it covers M&P.  So if he's laying there fucking dying...  Then it'll pay.  Oh, shit.  Right.  Fucking sick.  So it's sort of anti-insurance, you know, because... 
[02:01:00]  That's the kind I have.  Yeah.  Yeah, just catastrophic illness.  Yeah, what did you come in for?  Yeah, we don't cover that.  It encourages ill health, too, if you think about it.  Yeah, yeah, because there's no preventative measures or anything that nips something in  the bud, as they say.  So we covered those.  We got him in to see a primary care doctor, and we paid some lab work and some of that  stuff, and really appreciate the listeners of...  What are the channels now?  105 and... 
[02:01:30]  We don't know.  216.  2,700.  105 and 206.  And if someone wants to continue to donate, because we're still...  This is an ongoing thing, they can go to my website at drsteve.com, and it's right  at the top.  It says, Help Big A.  Cheap plug right there, sir.  There you go.  Help Big A.  Should we get that before you're hung up on me?  I've got to see him, man.  You want to talk to Big A?  It's got the big reveal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's have him sashay in here.  I know.  I present you...  Oh, wait, wait.  Wait.  Is it true that his speech is improving with the weight loss?  You did tell me that at dinner.  Yeah, I was talking to him on the phone, and it's like, dude, your stutter's gotten 
[02:02:00]  better, too.  So, uh...  You should know the words to ask him.  Because he's got the confidence.  Yeah.  Hi, Andrew.  And the swagger.  I present to you as medium A.  Look at that.  Medium-sized A.  Lowercase A.  Big A has lost a lot of weight.  I'm amazed.  A hundred pounds.  A hundred pounds.  Dude, he looks great.  A hundred pounds.  That's the same guy?  Yes.  Holy shit, Big A.  A hundred pounds.  A hundred pounds.  That's right.  Are you... 
[02:02:30]  Water?  He drinks water now.  All he drinks?  Oh, he's been over a few of the shindigs at the compound there, and he brings his own  little vegetables.  Absolutely.  Yeah, he's an annoying guy.  He brings his own shindigs.  And everybody else is just pigging out on horrible chunks of meat and everything.  Steamed vegetables.  Steamed.  Steamed.  You miss all the good food?  Big A.  No, not at all.  Come on.  Honestly.  You like eating steamed vegetables. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Well, good for you, man.  You look...  You're doing the right thing.  How do you like oxygen?  Is it good?  Are you appreciating it?  Yeah.  Living is awesome, you know?  Yeah.  Hey, Dr. Steve, can we build him shoulders next, or what?  Yeah, right?  What happened?  You were like...  Your shoulders are gone.  It looks like an athlete that's been paralyzed for three days, but he still has, like, those  trap muscles, you know, when they start to shrink.  That was really mean.  Yeah, he was carrying around.  It was really fucking mean.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders, and now it's gone, but your shoulders... 
[02:03:30]  Dude, if you look how small his shoulders are, he should be about a buck thirty.  You really should be, like, a skinny guy.  If you look at his skeletal system, dude, you're gonna be...  How much is more...  Can he lose, you think, Dr. Steve?  Well, we're gonna shoot for 250.  Lose 250?  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  Go away to 250.  I don't know how much he weighs.  Yeah, you're a skinny big A, but you look like a fat Joe DeRosa.  He had no shoulders.  Andrew's tall, so he can carry a little bit more weight, but if we can get him down to 
[02:04:00]  200...  Yeah, he's got that big head, and he's got the Popeye forearms.  Yeah.  I think you should put him on a weightlifting program.  How much does he weigh right now?  Get him in the sandlot league.  Sandlot league.  Big leather helmet.  313.  So you were 413?  Yes, I was.  Holy shit, so...  And we want to get him in the 200s.  Did you play sports at all when you were in high school, or...?  No.  No?  No.  Do you feel healthier?  Oh, yes. 
[02:04:30]  Much healthier.  The color came back to your skin.  That's kind of nice.  Yeah, your eyes are clear.  A lot more energy.  Kind of a grand...  Big A, the makeover.  I love it.  Good for you.  I know, really.  How do you sleep with that mask on?  Is it better?  Do you feel more rested?  Much better.  I sleep much better.  About five to six hours, at least.  So when you were in the morning, but you feel like you've rested.  Yes.  I want to get one of those.  Much better.  Wow.  What is the mask?  This is for sleep apnea.  You wear it when you're sleeping.  It forces air into your mouth.  It's like you don't go... 
[02:05:00]  It always gasp for breath.  Why?  Do you have that?  Yeah, I think so.  Terrible sleeper.  What, do you just wake up and the woman next to you is staring at you with hatred?  Exactly.  That happens anyway.  That would happen if she was deaf.  Madam, why are you fixing your wig?  And what's that...  Oh, it's not eating a swallow or something.  Daddy, you kept waking up.  You keep dreaming of Todd Christensen.  Oh, God, that was obscure.  Sorry.  But that big A looks much better.  All of Jimmy's women, he gives the Heimlich to thinking they swallowed a jawbreaker stuck 
[02:05:30]  in their throat.  As long as they don't give it to me.  A jawbreaker.  Hey, another jawbreaker stuck in another girl's neck.  And they have their own jawbreakers.  So...  Huh?  Actually, what...  Scared the hell out of me is...  We're not allowing curses much.  Bad language.  Language.  Sorry.  Language. 
[02:06:00]  When I had my arteries checked...  Forget what I said about the soldering.  Yeah, yeah.  I know, yeah, yeah.  Nah, he's just nervous.  He's nervous.  No, he's panicking.  So you had your arteries checked.  And the doctor who checked it told me if I keep eating the way I'm eating in six months,  I'll be dead.  Shit.  Oh, my God.  And I called the... 
[02:06:30]  And I called the...  That's fucking show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's terrible.  Ew, guys.  Oh, that's not even right.  Now, what...  So you're sitting there.  You got on the...  So they have that awful little hospital robe there, and you're, you know, exposed in the  back.  Now, what's going through your head when he said you're going to die in six months?  I called my nutritionist up, and I changed my eating habits completely.  What do you eat mostly?  Like, you eat a lot of salmon? 
[02:07:00]  McDonald's.  Yeah.  You're a nutritionist.  What were you thinking?  Clown.  It's big Ronald.  Is that for fucking delivery?  Yeah.  When you said you were going to die, what were you thinking?  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  I'm going to die.  Yeah.  Look at that picture.  I'm trying to get another applause break.  I'm trying to set you up for the sound effect.  That's sick.  Bill, that's sick.  Jesus Christ.  You have a face within a face there.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Look at his hands, too.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You lost fat on your hands. 
[02:07:30]  More importantly, that picture was taken at FH Riley.  It's 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  What's Andrew stopped eating there?  His heart got better.  He's healthier.  The business is in trouble now that Big A hasn't been around.  Fuck.  Look at the pelican.  Fly, pelican, fly.  So they said if you don't stop eating like that, you're dead in six months.  Yep.  Wow.  You didn't need any heart work done?  Dr. Steve?  No, actually, my arteries were clear. 
[02:08:00]  All clear.  Are you exercising?  You're lucky.  I'm walking about 15, 20 minutes a day until I build up.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll do treadmill or something next.  That's always.  Do you do treadmill or do you walk outside?  Just walk.  Just walk outside.  That's what always amazes me on The Biggest Loser.  They have some 400-pound guy jogging on a treadmill.  It's like, there's got to be a defibrillator, like, jumping to the left of the camera.  Right off the camera.  Right off the camera.  Sweating like crazy.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no way you can have people do that. 
[02:08:30]  Bill.  They're running longer than I would.  Bill, every once in a while, one of those people will fall off the treadmill.  And they will break character, and you will see the medical team come in immediately.  Right.  Swoop in.  That probably happens more.  Well, I suspect that they probably have showed every incident of that happening.  Yeah.  I watch The Biggest Loser crap.  I don't know.  I watch it.  You watch?  Yeah, I watch.  Watching the, looking at these old pictures, though.  It's weird.  It's the same guy.  Fucking no. 
[02:09:00]  They were huge.  My God.  He keeps going this way.  This time next year, he'll be unrecognizable.  He's going to be doing a calendar in about eight months.  There's a bunch of, or a group, a dental group in the city that's also doing free dental  work for him.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Good for you, big guy.  Big one, I have fiction.  He's like a barn find, like human being.  Yeah, a barn find.  All originals.  Now they're just redoing them.  I got somebody doing the upholstery.  This guy's doing his heart.  You get a whole makeover, dude. 
[02:09:30]  Body off restoration.  How great would it be if he loses all this weight, and then he's killed in an auto accident?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm just kidding.  How great.  He's crossing the street to accept his, to meet the hot girl he's going on a date with.  And he's hit by an ice cream truck.  Yeah.  The irony, yes.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wow, who's that girl on your lap there, big A?  When was that taken?  Oh, she has a nice rump. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, she does.  That's a nice hiney.  Big A was like, come here and sit on my gut.  Oh, what a fucking juicy ass.  Where was that?  That's big A's.  Was that one of the hookers you killed?  Yeah.  No.  Who was she?  Pau Tucci.  Oh, porn star.  Yeah, she squirted.  Big squirter.  I was trying to hug her.  Where'd you meet her?  Oh, yeah.  That was the one that squirted on your face?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Affirmative.  Affirmative.  All right, what else can we do with big A?  Damn, man.  Good for him.  Let's move on. 
[02:10:30]  Ah, yeah, yeah, good for you.  We're very happy.  Yeah, there's nothing but good shit happening in your life.  There's no humor here.  There's no humor in that.  What if...  You're dead to us.  Now, could you see he goes through all that and tomorrow is the last day of Earth.  Oh, that would suck.  On Earth.  Everything just goes to shit.  That would be terrible, huh?  That would be...  You'd have wasted all that good eating, you know?  You could eat in shit.  He'll look good in heaven, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  I don't think you take a lot of fat up there.  Oh, is that how that works?  You go to heaven, you take the body you died in?  Yeah.  There's one for suicide. 
[02:11:00]  That's how I think it works.  That's why the young ones are, you know...  Yeah.  They're the lucky ones.  If you believe in heaven.  Yeah.  The pill doesn't.  You go on the ground.  And that's it?  You go on the ground.  That's out.  You become a fossil fuel.  That's it.  Hard to...  All of the kittens...  Hard to wrap my mind around that.  Exactly.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  And that's how they come up with that shit.  I know.  You can't...  No one can wrap their brain around not existing.  So then you create the little Santa Claus story. 
[02:11:30]  There's this guy, and he's watching you.  Yeah.  Oh, you better watch out.  You better not.  And you gotta be good.  Yeah.  So that you can continue this better life for eternity.  You know what it is?  I was brought up in a bad religion.  Every higher power was mad at you.  Yeah.  I resented it.  Very angry.  It made me a very resentful person.  Very vengeful, angry God we have in the Catholic religion.  So everybody's gonna get saved who's a good person during the rapture, 
[02:12:00]  and then Jesus is gonna commit murder on a Stalin-esque level times.  It's like 900 times.  That's okay.  That's fine.  There's no like...  Sinners repent.  Yeah.  There's no questions that people ask when they come up with that.  Sinners repent, man.  Or else it's over, Johnny.  You don't...  That little pile of fucking Bill Burr clothes.  Have you guys seen that YouTube video where they did that Jesus freak?  They fuck with her?  They basically...  She goes to the bathroom, and then they leave a bunch of piles of clothes. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, my God.  And she came...  I swear to God, I don't know what the name of the video is.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Do a rapture prank.  Search that.  Rapture prank.  Rapture prank.  Oh, you gotta love 2011.  Yeah.  Fake raptures.  Fake raptures.  Do you know what?  I don't want to have the wrong one, because there's a couple of them on here.  Try that one, and just play it with the...  Or this one.  Yeah, it looks like they're in, like, a Starbucks...  Right here, right here.  Try this one right here.  We're gonna watch a video on the radio, everybody.  Well, we do it all the time.  Fuck the listeners.  We don't care.  We're back with Prank 316. 
[02:13:00]  Uh-oh.  You ever been someplace, and all of a sudden there's nobody around?  I think this is it.  Then you think, is this a rapture?  Happened to me once.  I was on a date.  It wasn't a rapture.  The girl just didn't like me.  But she's my wife now.  I think a lot of times, people are always looking forward towards the end of the world.  They're always thinking about the rapture.  They're always concentrating on it.  Let's not lose sight of the fact that we're here now.  We need to get other people saved.  We need to get other people in the church.  What the fuck is this guy? 
[02:13:30]  We need to go to heaven, too.  We just can't always be looking towards the future, because today...  Is this a trick, Bill, to preach to us?  No, no, no.  This is like his...  Just go past all this horse shit.  Geez, Bill.  The victim.  Here we go.  So she believes in this shit.  They're sitting in a little Starbucks.  Rusty, who helped set Rebecca up to get left behind.  I love how they've stolen the formula for a reality show for this Jesus Freak shit.  Yeah, this is it.  All right.  So they're all sitting in this Starbucks.  And I forget what happens.  Everybody...  The restaurant is in on the prank. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  I forgot he's going to explain it.  Of course.  Yeah.  All right.  She's...  Here she comes.  Rebecca thinks she's just meeting her friends for coffee and gossip.  But little does she know what's going to happen.  So these guys are all full-on Jesus Freaks, and they believe in the rapture.  She's going to gossip.  Yeah.  You hear who the devil's been fucking?  Ooh.  Ooh.  That's right.  You might want to just fast...  Did you guys see the movie?  I'm sitting around. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  You don't need any of this shit.  It's like five minutes.  Two girls, one cup.  Two girls, one cup.  All right.  So basically...  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  They call her on a cell phone.  She has to go out to make a call.  And the second it closes...  Everyone now...  Okay.  Everyone's getting up.  Yeah.  They're grabbing clothes, and they're taking their shoes off and shirts off.  Yeah, because...  Why don't they just have clothes stashed somewhere?  Because they can't afford a second set of clothes.  Oh.  Oh.  And now they're all running... 
[02:15:00]  They're all running away.  So...  To a back room.  So they left a couple people who didn't get saved.  And now there's just clothes sitting on the chairs where...  Where people were.  People had been.  And coffee.  Laptop on the ground.  Shoes just strewn about.  Now you gotta understand, this girl is full on into this stuff.  Right.  So she totally believes this.  What a dope.  You don't get to take your clothes.  How embarrassing.  Tom.  Now watch. 
[02:15:30]  Okay.  What happened?  Now this is their bad acting, and she believes it.  Yeah.  She doesn't notice the camera.  She's looking off.  She's holding her cup of coffee.  She's looking perplexed.  And no one is answering their phone.  No one...  No one's picking up.  No one in there?  What's the...  They're gone.  They're gone.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  Wait.  What are you talking about?  Just a second ago, everyone was hearing that. 
[02:16:00]  Tribulation time, biatch.  Are you...  Yeah.  Wait.  This is really scaring me.  She thinks she's going to hell.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Because she didn't get taken.  That's great.  Have we been left behind?  What'd she say?  Have we been left behind?  No.  But I love G.  No.  She's crying.  This is what he...  You guys, I think...  We've been left behind.  Yay. 
[02:16:30]  What does that mean?  What is that?  I wonder if she's talking about it.  Who?  Who's talking about it?  They've...  They've gone...  They've gone to heaven,  and we've been left here.  Idiot.  Who's they?  Who's they?  Christians.  How far are you going to take this fucking joke with them?  They should keep it going.  I thought you guys were bad.  They should have let her just kill herself or something.  No.  No.  I think it's fake.  Maybe it is.  You start thinking it's fake.  Wait, wait, wait.  I've got to hit the camera TV show. 
[02:17:00]  I've got to hit the camera TV show.  Come on, you guys.  Oh, look.  Everyone's coming out now and looking at her like she's a lunatic.  You guys, this is freaking out.  By the way, she doesn't have the relief she should have that she...  She should have a lot more relief realizing she's not going to hell.  Yeah, exactly.  First being tormented and killed in horrific fashion by being left behind.  I think that's what happens, right?  If you're left behind, Jesus comes down and deals with you within a few... 
[02:17:30]  That's the funny thing.  ...a couple of months of just beating the piss out of you.  It's not enough that they were taken to heaven.  No, why don't I just go directly to hell?  I've got to wait for the beat down, and then I'm going to go to hell.  It's just so...  Reeks of human people.  What do you think?  Jesus was given a fucking fatal injection of blue fluid?  Exactly.  No!  Not true.  That guy was beaten, so he's getting some retribution.  Her acting gave it away.  She was in on it, Bill.  You think so?  I think so, too.  You guys are all so...  No, no, because she didn't react strongly enough when they came back in. 
[02:18:00]  Fake, fake, totally fake.  Oh, you guys have got me.  Oh, my God, you got me.  You just thought the rapture happened, stupid.  Exactly.  That would be a big relief.  Much bigger relief.  Well, I just found it to be consistent with the guy in the beginning.  I thought he was awful with the monologue he was doing.  It's not a bad video.  You know, the religious people, though, fanatics like that, you don't know.  She probably did believe it.  I got to admit, three-quarters of the way through it, I started going, oh, fuck, is this fake?  Yeah.  As you were watching that?  That was the rapture.  Did I just waste radio time, valuable radio time? 
[02:18:30]  That's all right.  Dr. Steve, can we meet, who are we bringing in next?  Bobo?  Stalker Patty?  Well, I've got PA John and PA Jill.  PA John's my partner on Weird Medicine.  PA Jill's his wife, and she's on our show from time to time.  Does that thing measure body fat?  Yes.  How does it do that?  It does it by measuring electrical...  Resistance?  Resistance?  In the fucking fat?  Yeah.  Holy shit, that's science.  There's a formula.  Does that guy on Green Acres sell you that? 
[02:19:00]  Mr. Haney, I've got a genuine gin.  Mr. Douglas, we're going to sell you a fat body index reader.  Oh, Mr. Haney, I don't need one of those.  Haney always sells it to me.  Ah, that guy.  Genuine.  I would never get on that.  Fuck that.  No, you don't want to deal with that.  No.  All right, bring your people in there, Dr. Steve.  What are you talking about?  You've been dropping poundage.  It's only $5.  $5?  $10? 
[02:19:30]  He's always trying to juw him up.  Hi.  Here we go.  Hey, hello.  How are you doing?  How are you?  What's up?  That's a radio partner, huh?  Lovely lady.  Yes, I know.  Lovely lady alert.  Lovely lady alert.  The lovely PA Jill.  Les Nesman.  Yes.  And the equally lovely PA John.  Ah.  Yes.  And Weird Medicine is your co-host, I guess?  Yes.  And in what capacity do you serve? 
[02:20:00]  Absolutely nothing.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you a doctor?  No.  PA.  He's PA.  Physician's assistant.  Oh, I thought that was a nickname for them because they're from Pennsylvania.  I really did.  He's a nurse?  Like DC Benny?  No, he's a physician's assistant.  They both are.  Oh, physician's assistants.  So you go get me this and they get it for you.  Yeah, pretty much it.  Sort of like that.  I like that.  He's your Kenny.  Your club soda Kenny.  But instead of coffee, he has to get you four sips.  He has to get me.  Five.  Five sips. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you, Chip.  Finally, you put the voice on for a bomb.  Hey, could you give Stalker Patty a pussy exam today?  Oh.  I mean, there's nothing in the physics of the universe that would prevent it.  I don't think a snatch has ever been looked at.  I bet you could examine the outside.  You know, the labia region.  Please, please, please.  The clitoral hood.  Yes.  Making sure there's no abnormalities.  Smell the mucus. 
[02:21:00]  Make sure it smells proper.  Oh, God.  Where's Stalker Patty?  Fuck this polite shit.  Let's do a bit for once.  There's probably an old TV guide in there.  Okay.  To cast a one day at a time on it.  Patty, how old are you?  I'll be 56 in three weeks.  Holy shit.  My fault.  Family affair.  Yeah, family affair.  Have you ever had your pussy looked at?  Well, they tried to do a pap smear and didn't succeed. 
[02:21:30]  Finally, they did because I'm so small.  Because I'm a virgin.  But I did very well.  I was clear and everything.  I'm very healthy.  Dr. Steve, now...  I'm just so fucking sad.  It's a bright, sunny day.  How would it be too small to do a pap smear?  Don't they put in...  What is that?  A speculum?  Yes.  Now, they would put that in and...  And what's the matter?  You couldn't really crank it open?  No, it hurt.  It was excruciating.  If I ever go through that again, I want to be knocked out. 
[02:22:00]  I'm sure that could be arranged.  Yeah, believe me.  I want to take...  I want them to give me medicine to knock me out so I sleep through it.  Then maybe I'll be more relaxed.  I'd hit that spatula like a fucking handbrake.  Just make her hurt.  Wham!  Fucking squeegee.  Oh, you bitch.  I put one in your ass.  Would you allow this medical team to look at your vagina?  As long as it was on a medical standpoint only and that's it.  Well, of course.  On a radio show, why wouldn't it be medical? 
[02:22:30]  It's not for entertainment purposes whatsoever.  Why wouldn't Patty be a virgin?  Because if she's this freaked out by sex, she's been...  Something happened.  Oh, something happened years ago.  She's had a dick in her.  Oh, she was fumbled when she was younger.  That's never happened.  No.  You don't remember.  That fucking foster father, whatever he was, the guy that was taking care of you, that  peeked in on you when you showered.  He didn't watch me.  He would just walk in and out like I was a baby or something.  That was about it.  Like you were a baby. 
[02:23:00]  Not like you were a baby or something.  You weren't a baby.  You were a baby.  You were uncovering trauma here.  Let's try to be delicate.  Well, about 10, 11.  Patty was 10 or 11.  She's in the bathtub.  You know, but we weren't allowed to close the door.  Yeah, no shit.  That guy was pretty smart, though, when you break it down.  You just really make the rules.  You set the rules.  But he would lay on the couch with her and then make her sleep with him.  You hear that?  Well, that was when I went to my Auntie Margaret's house and that was because there was no room.  They don't have another good room.  Yeah, that's why.  That's why he did it.  So there's no room, so he had to sleep in the bed with you. 
[02:23:30]  Well, not the bed.  On the couch.  The couch.  How old were you?  But nothing happened.  I was fine.  Yeah, you never thought of getting 12.  You remember.  12.  You don't sleep with 12.  12 years old.  I know.  And what were you dressed like during this sleep?  Just my regular flannels, you know?  You were in flannel jammies.  Yeah.  And what did he dress in?  His regular flannels.  Sometimes he was just in his underwear, right?  No.  Did you have a door in the back?  What?  The trap door.  Do you understand why it's a little curious that you find a speculum to be excruciating? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Well, it hurts.  It's psychological, though.  Yeah, but do you understand how the two could be related?  It's not psychological.  It was very physical.  You tighten up, though.  You tighten up because you don't want that feeling again of something in your vagina.  It's just like probing fingers, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Probing fingers.  It's like a full-court press-like therapy.  Her hymen was still...  Yeah, I was going to say intervention.  Yeah, but I was the tampon used, too.  Delicate part of her life.  You're supposed to be concerned of that.  You were molested.  He had a mustache. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, he touched you in the shower.  Yeah.  We don't have a lot of time because this show's moving fast.  Can we start from looking at her vagina?  You got a medical team right there for you, Patty.  Before this gets crazy, Bill Burr.  This is what they left at Caroline's, 10.30.  Bill might be leaving.  Yes.  This is what they invented PAs for, so absolutely.  All right.  I would think Big A has to get up from where he is, and you could use that couch, I guess.  How is that going to work if...  Well, I think she should lay on the counter.  We need a blanket or something.  I just remembered I forgot something down the hall. 
[02:25:00]  What happened, Bill?  You all right?  There was something...  What, blindfold?  Yeah.  Can I have one of those curtains across my face?  Yeah, blindfold and a clothespin.  A clothespin, right.  We were supposed to see how many sit-ups and push-ups, Patty.  Right.  We'll get to that.  We'll step up, you motherfuckers.  We've got to make sure she's physically sound to do those exercises.  Instead of sit-ups, we're going to...  I do have arthritis.  God damn it.  Shut up.  I have a cyst joke.  Oh, God. 
[02:25:30]  It's funny.  I'm going to count the cysts.  Oh, fuck, Patty.  I hate you.  No, she didn't know.  I know.  Can we put her up on the console?  Why?  Really?  We could, I guess.  We got a blanket or something?  God, this is like...  Yeah, we need a blanket.  What about a pinball machine?  We need a blanket.  Can we use your coat, Bill?  We've got a blanket.  What?  Can we use your jacket so she's comfortable?  Oh, I see where this bit's going.  Bill appears to be uncomfortable.  What if we put the comedy as close to Bill as humanly possible? 
[02:26:00]  How do you want to do this?  Hey, Dr. Steve, we'll just have you come up and do some sit-ups and push-ups and we'll  do...  Hey, let's be fine.  How many times are you going to fall for that?  I didn't know this was going to happen.  Look, this is a step up.  Usually, you're sticking fingers in guys' asses when you do...  That's true.  At least it's an alleged woman.  Patty, why don't you take your pants off?  If it's time for your vaginal exam from Dr. Steve and his medical crew...  Patty, what do you say?  You haven't been naked in this studio a lot, or are we just...  I'm assuming that's what's happening behind these lovely curtains. 
[02:26:30]  I have to assume that other people work on this radio show as well.  Curtain change.  Yeah, we should wait for the blanket.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How have you been, Patty?  I've been fine.  I declared bankruptcy three weeks ago.  Congratulations.  Well, I filed three years ago.  And I just finally got through the final court process three weeks ago.  Bankruptcy?  Yeah.  How much are your bills?  How much do you owe?  I was about $18,000 in debt, which to me is a billion dollars to me. 
[02:27:00]  No, it's just $18,000.  Well, to me, that's all the money in the world.  You're tapped out.  You let the rest of us fucking pay your check.  Yeah.  How dare you come in here and talk about your goddamn bankruptcy?  You're a quitter.  No, actually...  You're tapped out.  Oh, yeah, we know that.  You could fucking beg for $18,000 over the course of a year in front of Penn Station.  What the fuck?  Wait a minute.  How did you get into $18,000 in debt?  A lot of it's the medical.  When I was uninsured and getting my heart checked and everything. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, everybody's got a sob story.  Then I just got the Fidelis, so that's going to help.  I don't buy a fucking word of it.  I just got my Fidelis a couple years ago.  Fidelis.  You know.  Sky, what is it, a secret?  No, it's a type of insurance, HMO.  I know.  How's your heart?  I'm buying all those Christy Alley products.  Well, I still got my Treval prolapse.  I take medication for it, and it's under control.  It's fine.  And so is my asthma.  Yeah, right, Steve?  Yeah.  Her asthma. 
[02:28:00]  You're like a fucking Yorkie.  It's a mess.  Holy shit.  I don't understand the baby aspirin, though, but the doctor's making me take it.  The what?  I don't understand the aspirin.  It's a blood thinner.  Wait.  I didn't hear you.  Exactly right.  You pat it in what?  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you.  What?  You didn't understand the what?  What did you say?  The taking of the aspirin with the heart medication.  What kind of aspirin?  What do you take?  Baby aspirin.  81 milligrams a day.  Ten more times, please.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Aspirin.  S-P-E-R-N.  So you take the baby aspirin?  Yeah, and then I just take the heart medication.  Heart medication plus what?  Baby aspirin.  Oh.  I thought that was what preparation H was for.  Aspirin.  That's a good one.  See?  Play on words.  Oh, that's an old, old joke.  My ass burns.  My ass burns.  Why don't you guess?  Yeah, right.  18,000 in debt and you declared bankruptcy. 
[02:29:00]  18,000?  They probably were like, you quit.  That's crazy.  I did it for less than that, but I was a kid.  So I don't know.  Yeah, you're a little.  You weren't fucking 57.  But look at the big differences.  I've been going for counseling.  I haven't overdrawn my bank account in six months.  I've been in the positive.  Good for me.  Well, that's pretty easy when you have everybody else pay your goddamn bills.  That's right.  And you steal your shoes from there.  The only thing I owe is my electricity and gas, and I pay my phone, and I pay my XM bill. 
[02:29:30]  Randy Moss has more yards than you have my desk.  You know, we love that they have XM, but she couldn't get rid of that, right?  No, no.  No, she declares bankruptcy, but goddamn, I've got to hear this dumbass show.  I've got to hear this piece of shit.  How much do you owe the Santa Dark Knight for those shoes?  I didn't even see it.  I go to K-more.  All right, Patty, it's time to disrobe for the doctors.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:30:00]  Time to disrobe for the doctors.  I'm trying to do some sort of Robin Hood reference.  I just couldn't get that.  That's a good one.  Way down?  I don't know.  You doing summer stock, Patty?  Can we get her up here so we can be able to talk you guys through it?  We can move Bill over, because he's uncomfortable.  We'll need to move some things, but I think...  You know what?  Now I know.  I fell back for her until she declared bankruptcy.  Now I don't care.  Move the phone, and she can kind of lay in that area so we can talk.  Yeah, there you go, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Oh, Patty.  She's got no stick-to-itiveness.  Patty, come on up on the console.  I owe $50, and I declared bankruptcy. 
[02:30:30]  All right, Patty.  Bill hates stock or Patty?  No, I don't.  I hate people who fucking declare bankruptcy when you have that low amount of money.  Yeah, that's like $18,000.  Yeah, because then we all have to pay for it.  Yeah.  What do you think that is?  What are you getting?  A government bailout?  I swear to God.  That's got to be an extra $0.15 I pay a year, because...  What are you, Lehman?  Patty, come on.  Get your clothes off.  She's going to...  Bill, you have to move over a little bit.  Yeah, move over.  I'm not moving for this goddamn deadbeat son of a bitch.  We'll do it over here. 
[02:31:00]  This deadbeat son of a bitch.  Let's do it over here.  They want the couch.  We'll need a flashlight, then.  No, no, no, no.  Bill, move this way.  Go ahead, absolutely.  Bill, move that way.  Oh, absolutely.  No, you can move this way, Bill.  You have a flashlight, sir?  And you have a zero balance on your credit card, thanks to the rest of us, and I've yet  to hear you say thank you.  I don't use credit cards.  Patty, get up on the console, and then you can take your pants off.  Yeah, you want to cover up with the blanket first, and then...  No, it's a snuggie.  We're going to use this.  Jesus.  How weird is it that that's here while this is going on? 
[02:31:30]  Why is she...  Well, she can...  No, no, no.  No, no, no, Patty, wait.  A little of the old in-out, in-out.  But she's still standing there and doing nothing.  You got another one of those?  Real savage.  Patty, do you remember how to do radio?  We don't have all day.  Take your fucking pants off.  Wait a minute.  Losing Bill Burr?  No.  I'm not going to stand here.  You're taking off?  All this deadbeat.  All this deadbeat.  Are you really leaving?  We can do something else.  No, no.  I'm out of here.  I don't stand for this.  We can do something else.  I don't want to lose Bill Burr. 
[02:32:00]  Me too.  It's not that she's showing her pussy.  She declared bankruptcy, and I've had it.  Wait a minute.  Do you have to go...  These deadbeat sons of bitches.  Wait.  I don't want to lose Bill.  We can fucking not do this.  No, no, no.  Let the deadbeat show her pussy.  This hit a nerve.  It hit a nerve?  You know, Patty, I used to like you.  I really did.  Yeah, $18,000.  You don't declare bankruptcy.  You know, Patty, that was a great joke until you looked at me with that level of hurt.  I'm just fucking around with you. 
[02:32:30]  I hope so.  Because I want my credit to be good again.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  I just made it worse.  Credit score is like five.  Does she have sexy underpants on?  Patty, what the fuck do you care about a credit score?  What major purchases are you going to buy ever?  None.  Exactly.  So what the fuck do you give a shit for?  Why do you wear a real...  I want to be...  They'll put a mic on it.  Why does she wear sexy underwear if she's not using her vagina?  What if she got, like, a thong on or something?  They look like the shirt of someone in the barbershop court everywhere.  What are you covering yourself?  Don't be modest.  We've seen you a thousand times. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Well, she's embarrassed because there's all these studs in the room.  She won't be mad.  Where's Big A?  He's over there with his blackness bag.  Oh, no.  Hey, you get nice boners now that you lost weight, Big A?  Better boners?  Yeah, we can talk about that.  Go ahead.  Yeah, actually, I am...  You got some good stiffies on.  Yeah.  We have a thing on our show.  It's...  Feature. 
[02:33:30]  Make Big A cum.  Cumsies for Big A.  But it's Dr. Steve's rule.  For every 35 pounds of weight that you lose, you gain an inch of penis length.  Oh, wow.  Yep.  Is that if you're overweight or no?  Yeah, it's if you're overweight.  So you've gained three inches on your penis there, Big A?  He was probably starting out with a negative flaccid, so I'm guessing.  Oh, my God.  Am I right?  Wait, he couldn't find his penis?  He was so fat, is what you're saying?  Well, at that level, what happens is the fat pad in the pelvis... 
[02:34:00]  ...involutes the penis so that you can't see it.  You know, it then becomes flush with the skin.  It hides.  It's so scared.  The pubis.  Yeah.  Did you have a fatty pubis?  The pubis.  That's a great name for a horse in the derby.  Fatty pubis.  Fatty pubis.  Fatty pubis.  All right, Patty, take off your sexy underwear.  Let's go.  Speaking of fatty pubis.  I'm right.  Fatty pubis.  Let's get a dunk fist.  Look at it.  Let's get a dunk fist.  Wait, we're losing Jimmy now? 
[02:34:30]  I had a pee.  Holy shit.  I got to run to the bathroom, too.  What's going on, man?  We could take leaks.  I don't care.  All right, we'll break and we'll have...  Are we done for real?  Yeah, we might as well.  We'll get a break and then we'll have Stalker Patty's...  Just stay there.  Just stay there.  And Chris is here, right?  Whatever.  Chris Hardwick is here.  Oh, is he?  All right, so he's going to have to look at a very old vagina when we get back as well.  And then John Rich, one of the finalists of Celebrity Apprentice, is going to be on 
[02:35:00]  the show.  And hopefully Bill comes back.  What was that about?  I don't know.  Does he have something to do?  I have no idea.  Don't blame me, because we'll fucking blow off this bit if it means he wasn't Bill Burr.  I don't know what that was.  No, no, no.  He's here.  I don't think he wants to look at a snatch, but he's here.  All right, so we're going to figure some shit out.  Yeah, we'll do this.  Stay there.  Sirius XM, the virus.  Yeah, this is the OPN Anthony Show.  Damn it.  All right, what a mess. 
[02:35:30]  Patty put her pants back on.  That's not good.  You're taking your pants off.  We lost Bill Burr.  Bill has decided there's some things he just doesn't want to be a part of anymore.  Bill's changed a little bit over the years.  Bill, is it a...  Oh, you didn't find God, because you think we just rot. 
[02:36:00]  So it's not a God thing.  Bill's changed over the years a little bit.  I think your soul is pixelated, and every time you see something you shouldn't have seen,  a couple of cubes float away, and you never get them back.  A couple of cubes.  Yeah, food doesn't quite taste as good.  You don't enjoy music as much.  I don't need to see a 57-year-old homeless pussy.  And you think it's only a couple of cubes, but after a while, those cubes add...  Bill says he thinks we rot.  He means as a show.  Yes.  What if we brought a mic all the way around, Toby, here, so you're not really seeing her 
[02:36:30]  pussy?  You know, come on.  It's accessory to a crime.  Yeah, he's close enough.  No, we got real doctors.  What if I just drive the getaway car?  Yeah, he's just the wheel man.  What if they do it over there?  What if we do it here?  I was doing my job.  Hey.  I did what I was told about.  I'm just the wheel man.  It's not like I'm a second story guy.  What if we do it over there?  You don't even have to turn around.  You just face this way.  I'm just...  Did you guys put Purell all over here, or no?  That's right.  There's nothing cleaner than her vagina. 
[02:37:00]  There's nothing in it.  Really?  No germs.  We do have a bit, but...  Dog's mouth.  He only knew.  That's clean.  He only knew what happened here.  Let me just set this up.  We do have a bit, Bill.  But we are waiting for a medical supply store to open.  We need a pediatric speculum, by the way.  But don't say why, because I don't want her to back out.  But we do have a bit now.  Speculum.  You're predicting what's going to fall out of her vagina when you open it up.  But the medical supply store doesn't open until 10.  Right.  So now we're in this quandary.  Ah, jeez. 
[02:37:30]  That's why you've got to do a little research before you start a bit.  Shrinky dink.  So much for the city that never sleeps, you can't get a pediatric speculum.  This is a niche.  Am I allowed to talk yet?  Yeah.  I'm trying to introduce you, but there's so many mics on.  This is Chris Hardwick.  Hey, guys.  I love Bill Burr's idea that his spiritual de-resolution.  Just a slow de-resolution process.  It really is.  It makes sense.  Well, all of a sudden, we just cease to exist anymore.  It's like...  That's why I won't watch beheading videos and stuff like that.  So I do understand the concept. 
[02:38:00]  You can't un-watch it.  Why do I always do that?  Yeah, exactly.  I understand the concept, but this doesn't bother me, this type of thing.  And the resolution gets worse and worse.  Until you can't make out the features anymore, and then you're just not...  No, people, you still look like a guy walking down the street, but you're empty.  No, I mean, your soul is just...  Yeah, it's gone.  Like the resolution...  I mean, the line at the pediatric spectrum store, speculum store, must be at least...  How many pediatric speculum?  10, 12 people deep right now, right?  I mean...  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  It's New York.  You should be able to get a speculum at any hour. 
[02:38:30]  Well, Paul's got an account down there.  Can't we just go down to Times Square where they sell those boom boxes in the store?  They must have.  They've got one.  I bet you they do have one.  Yeah, go down to Canal Street.  Buy a ripoff one.  Hey, speculum, buddy.  You need speculum, buddy.  I love New York.  Those camera stores, I bet you they do have one.  They've got a speculum.  Yeah.  In the back.  Yeah.  For 10 times the price.  They probably do the procedure.  You can use and eat Chinese food, too.  You want the door of the Explorer speculum?  Oh, shit.  Door of the Explorer.  Yeah.  Patty needs a small one because her vagina apparently is very small. 
[02:39:00]  Should we give out the bit?  Yeah, why not?  Sure, of course.  We can find out if she's really a virgin.  Yeah.  But I am.  Well, that's easy for you to say.  That's your word against your personality, which says that you were molested.  I don't think anything could happen between me and my cat.  Well, no.  We're talking about many years ago.  You don't have to worry about it.  You don't need to use a euphemism.  Nothing ever happened.  I never slept with a guy before. 
[02:39:30]  All right.  That's fine.  So then you have nothing to worry about.  My cat.  I have nothing.  Well, you slept with a man, and it was that guy that watched over you.  That's your father.  It was completely non-sexual.  Trust me.  Stop it.  You can see he can smell his breath and how bad his breath was when he lay there.  He would hold you.  He smelled cigarettes and liquor.  He told me that.  No, he didn't do that either.  Yes, he did.  You said he held you on the couch.  You've already told us that.  He put his arms around you and hold you on the couch when you slept.  Yes, he told us that.  This is much different than the chess talk Jim Norton and I had the last time I was talking 
[02:40:00]  about Boris Basky and Bobby Fischer.  Oh, were we?  Oh, man.  Yes, you were.  Just a little different.  Jimmy's a renaissance man.  That's right.  No, it doesn't matter.  It's a topic.  You can roll with it.  A little bit of everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's a 56-year-old virgin, Chris.  Oh, hi.  Nice to meet you.  She's not that ugly where she should be a virgin at 56.  No, she's just so hung up and crazy about sex.  God and stuff.  And, yeah, I think the religion thing screwed her up. 
[02:40:30]  She was left at the diner when she was a kid in a basket like the little rascal or some  shit.  You know, the rapture is tomorrow, so now would be a good time to hop on something.  Yeah.  Oh, it's not going to happen.  You want to blow everyone in the room?  They're all hamsters, those guys predicting that.  Hamsters.  She had to go to a foundling home.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so she was raised in the foundling home, and then she was given to a certain foster  people.  Yeah.  And they apparently think there was this heavy religion that was placed onto her, which gave 
[02:41:00]  her the guilt, and then there could have been some touching.  Tell me how there's a God when you can allow a kid to just, you know, have that kind of...  I agree, Bill.  That's why there is a God.  That's my whole dating fucking...  What shit happens to me.  Exactly.  I just...  There's also the devil.  Yes.  I mean, what...  Yes.  Oh, so he won this round?  Hey, John.  Well, when rapture...  Exactly.  It doesn't make any...  The whole thing doesn't make any...  Wait, is John a God guy?  You a God guy, John? 
[02:41:30]  Raised that way.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we all were raised that way.  Yeah, and then we all realize, oh, Santa, he's the bunny.  I just sit like that.  Are you a God guy?  Hey, look at that God guy over there.  Look at that God guy.  What stupid God guy.  But the rapture then comes around.  What a problem with your faith?  Call the God guys.  And then everyone's fine.  You know, if you're good, then you're fine with the rapture, and then the bad people...  The devil doesn't win, because the bad people get to, you know... 
[02:42:00]  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's like, good from whose perspective?  It's interesting.  The Bible, sir.  Right, right, right.  The Bible, sir.  Yes, yes, yes.  It's all in the book.  The good book.  Do you read the Bible, Patty?  Yeah, I have looked through it, yeah.  What do you think of it?  Well, yeah, it's, you know, it's the inerrant word of God.  I believe that.  You do?  Yeah.  You believe all those wacky fantasy stories of, you know, Job and shit like that?  Talking to a bush and killing your kid.  Well, I don't know. 
[02:42:30]  I think a lot of it's...  See, I don't know.  I wasn't there when it was written, and that book was written.  You weren't that far off, though.  You know.  Yeah.  She knew the author.  You know.  Exactly.  But I had very basic beliefs.  Pontius Pilate would always try to touch my vagina.  I used to hate when Pontius Pilate would touch my vagina.  It also says in there that if a man dies, his brother is supposed to take, marry his sister  and procreate with his sister.  Yeah, yeah.  How about that?  That's a little twisted.  I love that.  You have to understand that when these books were being constructed, you know, like, there 
[02:43:00]  was not a population problem, and all these tribes were vying for dominance.  Yeah.  And so, like, one of the prime directives was you have to procreate as much as possible,  which is why, you know...  Yeah, procreation is one of the biggies in the Bible.  Yeah, and you're not supposed to pull out...  Be fruitful and multiply.  Yeah, you're not supposed to come on her back.  It doesn't say, cometh on her back.  Right.  Nothing like that.  Well, it's against the religion right to spill seed. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Which is how they justify seed upon the ground.  Oh, well, the ground.  I'm a cereal seed spiller.  Oh, please, so am I.  I love spilling seed.  That was about sperm?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, Onan kept casting his seed on the ground.  I'm sorry.  If it's just spilling out of you, you're not enjoying it.  Yeah.  Welcome back.  I was just...  You got news on in the background.  There's two guys.  One has an American flag tie, and the other guy has a tie that has a bunch of dollar signs 
[02:44:00]  on it.  Oh, wow.  That says it all, America.  This is a legitimate, like, news channel, right?  That says it all.  Yeah.  It's on...  Well, it's Friday.  It's casual Friday.  That's why.  Casual.  They're wearing their fun ties.  Oh, we got that.  The other guy's got a Tasmanian devil tie.  It's for the deaf audience who can't afford a...  Patty doesn't...  ...text.  I can't remember a word today.  Patty wants to have sex, though.  I just want to throw that out there, too.  With somebody that I love that I'll be with the rest of my life in a committed relationship. 
[02:44:30]  What, a week?  Yeah.  Why don't you join one of those dating sites on the web?  Ah, eHarmony.  Exactly.  You're an eHarmony broad.  Yeah.  How about that?  What, do you do eHarmony?  Yeah.  Yeah, but that has a price.  You have to pay to be on that site.  eHarmony, eHarmony, eHarmony, eHarmony, you know.  She tried that.  Remember, she signed up for some...  Yeah, that's the one.  I mean, I'm still on it, but I'm not active, you know.  And Chris Hardwick, she just declared bankruptcy because she owed $18,000. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, my God.  And she said, I give up.  I gave up at 18 G's.  Every single person we're talking to right now owes at least that.  But she decided she needs to fucking...  Actually, maybe it might even be a little more.  I don't have the exact balance sheet home.  You could panhandle a third of that by Friday.  You know.  If you had some gumption.  How's the right sign and a little dog there if you could feel bad for the dog?  But anyway, I'm on the right track.  You know, I haven't overdrawn my bank account for six months. 
[02:45:30]  I'm keeping track of everything.  I'm doing everything they told me to track.  It's like the name of a bad early 80s sitcom.  On the right track.  On the right track.  She's on the right track.  She's gonna make something of her dumb self.  It's raining baby specimens.  She's a single mom.  Are we gonna examine her behind us?  She's a single mom.  And she's got a Chevy Vega.  But she's on the right track.  She's just driving.  You're in her son. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, God.  It's Alice.  Isn't that Alice?  It is Alice, yeah.  Guys, you just made a Whit Thomas production.  That's what that was.  Sorry.  Chris Hardwick.  There's a Nell Carter or a B. Arthur in there somewhere.  And a very special episode.  We'd get at least a season three.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The episode All in the Family where that guy tries to rape Edith and then she guilts him out of it.  Oh, yeah.  That one was great.  He didn't actually rape her, right?  No, no.  She sucked him out of it.  I don't think she sucked it a little.  That was before you could show blowjobs on television. 
[02:46:30]  Dr. Steve, it's to you.  Let's get her vagina examined.  Make sure she's got nothing going on in there.  Oh, boy.  I don't.  Okay.  A slight problem is that the Speculum store doesn't open until 10.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Can we make one?  If they stay open late on Fridays.  Please tell me they have a jingle in a TV commercial.  Can we MacGyver one or what?  Is this a clubhouse?  Can we make one? 
[02:47:00]  Should I just go get some binder clips from the mailroom?  It's a piece of medical equipment that has to come in a sterile fucking...  Dr. Steve, we can make one, right?  We can build one.  We can build one.  Yeah.  If you build it, she will come.  Go down to the hardware store and get some WD-40, a couple of clamps.  Is it sanitary?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Is your vagina sanitary?  All right.  Let's examine.  I have nothing going on there.  Let's examine her clam.  Let's do this.  Speculums, that sounds like a bad metal band.  It sounds like a bad metal band.  It sounds like a bad metal band. 
[02:47:30]  Speculums!  Yeah.  That's the forum.  The LA forum.  Oh, fuck.  Those guys are sick.  Yeah.  The first song was open wider.  Fucking love the open with that.  Exactly.  I really like Queen Hood.  Yeah.  Smells Like Plaque was a good one.  Oh, shit.  They're on their way up, those guys.  I remember when they used to just play clubs.  You ready to...  Yeah, exactly.  They're successful.  Fucking sellout.  Fucking I remember seeing them in a club, man. 
[02:48:00]  Not to play in the fucking garden.  Fuck them.  They're going all glam.  Yeah.  Selling out.  Hey, let's look at our vagina.  Chris, you all right with this?  Well, I feel bad.  Are you okay with this?  It's pure woman.  We've never asked her that question.  It's so nice I can have the blanket over me.  Chris, we've never asked that question.  Like in a full metal jacket.  Yeah.  Anthony, we've been doing bits with her for over ten years, and we never asked that question. 
[02:48:30]  That's so strange.  I love that there's an Opie and Anthony blanket that just goes over someone's head.  A crusty blanket.  To hide their shame.  The same blanket a girl used to clean up after she squirted for us.  Right.  I don't do things like that.  Dr. Steve, we're going to have to crawl under there like an 1800s photographer.  She's going to hold still for three hours.  I'm so glad I bought this body fat analyzer and had it chipped up.  Yeah, that is chipped up. 
[02:49:00]  Let's get our snatch.  If we did it now, it would just be silly.  Just put E-Rock's head on it.  I'll leave it here.  You guys have to lay out of that fucking thing.  Fat head.  That's a good idea.  Let's put E-Rock's head on the scale.  Let's do this.  Come on, everybody put up 20 bucks, the closest to get the amount of fat in his head.  It takes the pot.  Did that work?  Can we see how much fat is in his head?  Get that lunk head here.  How does the numbers work on this? 
[02:49:30]  Fat head.  E-Rock, can we measure your head?  It measures electrical resistance.  But I'm saying if we want to gamble, what kind of numbers do I got?  Over, under is?  Oh, okay.  Over, under is a percent.  Twenty-five percent is the line for men where you're considered obese.  What does the average head have as far as fat?  Fat head.  I'm trying to get an over-under here so we can get a line going.  You know, the average non-obese male would probably be about 20%.  Twenty-percent fat.  Twenty-percent fat. 
[02:50:00]  In their head?  In their head.  Well, it's like your cheek, right?  Over, under for E-Rock is 42.  Forty-two?  Forty-two?  That's a fat head.  I'll take the under.  No, no, no.  We got...  Now, if he lays the side of his face on there, it'll give you a reading?  You'll need to put his hand on the other side to complete the circuit.  To complete the circuit.  E-Rock, will you do this for us?  Just your head.  E-Rock.  E-Rock is in on the fat head contest.  It says here, I just looked up online, an adult human head weighs approximately between  eight and twelve pounds. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, we're not talking weight, though, sir.  Oh, no, no.  We're talking fat percentage.  Oh, fat percentage.  Okay.  Because we think E-Rock might have a fatter head than other people.  Okay.  An adult human cadaver head cut off around vertebrae C3 with no hair weighs on an average  somewhere between 4.5 and five kilograms, typically constituting around 8% of the body mass.  Okay.  That's on answer.com.  Yeah.  Written by Al-Zarqawi.  Yeah.  Exactly.  If the victim is a contractor...  5% you're saying is about the average? 
[02:51:00]  Well, actually, this just says that it's 8% of your total body mass.  Body mass.  Yeah.  Of your total body mass.  Now, quick question, though.  I'm going that he has 20% fat in his head.  Now, hang on.  Because his hand is going to be completing the circuit that we need to get his body fat percentage,  we will actually, in turn, be measuring the fat inside of his arm as well.  Is that correct?  That's right.  So this is going to be brain and arm.  What are the chances of him electrocuting himself today?  What if we dump water on his head as it's laying there?  Much resistance.  What did you say?  You said 22%? 
[02:51:30]  I said 20%.  All right.  No price is right.  I go 89.  No, no.  The one fucking...  I hate that.  21.  23.  None of that shit.  One dollar!  Yeah!  Yeah!  And then they win, and the person's just like, you fucking man.  Fucking fuck this game up.  Let's bring in E-Rock.  E-Rock, come on in.  I'm going to say 17%.  17?  Yep.  All right.  I went 89.  This poor guy, he's barely awake at the board.  You're dragging him in here to weigh his head.  You have no idea.  Barely awake and bored.  No, he eats mayonnaise directly out of the packet.  Yeah, you have no idea. 
[02:52:00]  That seems right.  You're supposed to do that, right?  You're supposed to do that.  Yeah.  He's skinny fat.  It's, you know, that muscle confusion.  You're supposed to do it to your heart every once in a while.  Confuse your heart into thinking you're dead.  Muscle confusion.  Yeah.  You do that with your heart, too.  After a couple days of broccoli, you just take some mayonnaise packets.  Okay, now this is designed to put feet on it, but I think we can make this work.  One thing that may screw it up is E-Rock's got a, you know, a double chin.  That's got to be 18%.  He's got some beard, so it may, you know, affect the conductivity. 
[02:52:30]  Very good, Danny.  You should get enough skin on that.  How old are you?  33.  Jesus.  Same age Christ and Belushi were.  And Chris Farley.  So you're going to stick his face where feet usually are?  Yeah, but it's clean.  It's never, we haven't used it.  Yeah, it's fine.  It's never been used.  It's okay.  How tall are you?  5'11".  Oh, this will take a minute.  Trying to squeeze an inch in on me?  Yeah.  I didn't know they stacked shit that high. 
[02:53:00]  Chris Hardwick, are we promoting anything as we get the...  Ah, yes.  I think we're promoting the decline of human civilization.  Yeah, that's true.  Nerdist on Twitter doing very well.  How many followers are you up to, just so we could all cry?  Oh, I don't know, like a million and a half.  Oh, I'm doing it.  It's amazing.  I'm performing at the Littlefield in Brooklyn this weekend.  The Littlefield?  Yeah, tonight.  Brooklyn, this evening.  Tonight.  Oh, I have to promote something.  My interview with Aziz is airing today at 6 p.m. Eastern on Raw Dog. 
[02:53:30]  And on the Boneyard, they have a Jim Norton weekend starting tonight, 6 p.m. Eastern as well.  Oh, a Jim Norton weekend.  They're just playing clips from my show all weekend on the Boneyard on Channel 38.  Good for you.  Yay.  Why is she taking pictures?  He rocked me, too.  He rocked me, too.  He wants to document the...  His fat hat.  That's for the future lawsuit.  He wants to document this moment in history, weighing his head.  You have very nice feet.  Why, thank you.  I'm not a foot guy, but you have nice feet.  Why won't you...  Look at the cleavage.  What's wrong?  She's beautiful, but she has very lovely feet.  Toes are like foot cleavage.  I don't...  I just happened to notice, because the shoes are very nice. 
[02:54:00]  Chris Hardwick, we don't get the feet thing in general on this show.  I don't...  I'm not a...  I don't get the foot feathers.  She has great feet.  Yeah.  I don't notice feet, but if they're exceptionally nice or exceptionally ugly, and hers are nice.  Yeah, they're very nice feet.  They're absolutely nice.  Might I call them tootsies?  Thank you.  Tootsies.  Jimmy.  You have nice little piggies, if I may.  Oh, I didn't forget about Patty, by the way.  How are we on the scale thing?  Why does he have a bedspread for underwear?  Danny jumps out with his shoes before Iraq puts his face on. 
[02:54:30]  Why does he have a bedspread underwear?  We don't like your fucking fire engine underpants.  We don't like your bedspread underwear, he says.  You go into a picnic.  Oh, it's guitars!  Bedspread underwear.  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star!  Underpants are fun.  What's wrong with you guys?  Underpants.  Underpants are fun.  I'm going to see a flying V.  Yeah.  Is that the prototype?  Does it usually take this long?  Yeah, all right. 
[02:55:00]  What's wrong with Dr. Steve?  What are you doing?  He was on the floor trying to get that...  He's panicking.  It's a little touchy, but we can try it.  Now, what you need to do is lay down so that we're just measuring your head.  Put your head on one side with the electrode touching...  With skin touching this electrode, and then on this side, put your arm across so it's touching  all three electrodes.  Oh, God, if his head just blew off like in scanners. 
[02:55:30]  If this doesn't work, then we can get him to stand up, and we can just do it the regular  way.  I've never tried it this way.  This, in theory, should work.  Let's just try it then.  All right, let's try it this way.  All right, 17, 20 bucks.  I say 20.  Don't touch it until we're ready.  I say 31.  31.  And then once you do it, I say fat.  This one here?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Put that little beautiful face there.  Press it down hard, yeah.  Yeah.  Is he supposed to bleed from the eyes?  Yep, yep.  Just like that.  Aw, he's sleeping.  Baby boy taking a nap. 
[02:56:00]  Okay, it's working.  Oh, it's working.  It's working.  Okay, try not to move.  Ah, shit.  That should be easy.  It's giving us an error.  Of course, there's nothing in there.  But it has a hollow thing on it.  It's like nothing can weigh this much and be this fucking...  Empty.  ...devoid of anything.  Right.  Holy shit.  We're measuring Erock's head.  It thinks you put a black hole on it.  I swear to God, New York sucks.  You can't get a speculum before 10 a.m.  You can't measure people's head fat. 
[02:56:30]  Ah, it really is.  What happened to the city?  Very, very disappointing.  The city used to be something, yeah.  Extremely disappointing.  What did I say, 31?  You said 30-something, yeah.  What kind of exercises can Chris do to decrease the...  Eric.  His...  Oh, it's Dr. Chris.  Am I saying Erock?  No, that's Dr. Steve.  The weight of his head is 21 pounds.  Michael.  Are you all right?  No, not, dude.  I'm going to get up at 6.30, 3.30 my time.  I hear you.  Wait, who said 21?  I said 12. 
[02:57:00]  And, Bill, what did you say?  What did I just call Erock?  Chris or something.  Chris?  I thought the doctor's name was Chris.  That's Dr. Steve.  And that's Chris Hardwick, too.  I know Chris Hardwick.  Jesus Christ.  You thought there was more than one Chris?  Getting a reading?  Yeah, I don't fucking know.  Bunch of zeros, right?  Perfect.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say the momentum of this bit is slowly dying here.  Because Dr. Steve doesn't know what he's doing.  Is it going to spell out boobs like on a calculator?  What do you got, Dr. Steve?  Okay.  He's looking. 
[02:57:30]  So his arm is 9 pounds.  Yeah.  So that...  Plus 21 is 30.  30 total.  21 plus 9.  No, but...  Well, it's 21 minus.  We want body fat.  All right.  We need to get the percentages.  Okay.  Now let me get the percentages.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  This...  Dr. Steve does not use a scale.  There's nothing more compelling than listening people measure things.  Yes.  Measuring is very important and people can relate to it.  Yeah.  You got to watch the video at the time.  People relate to it. 
[02:58:00]  Everybody measures.  Yeah.  Sometimes you push the ruler too far.  What kind of doctor is Dr. Steve?  He's a hospice doctor.  Oh, he is.  Oh, he is.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the last doctor you get to see.  He's known as the white angel.  So it must be very...  It must be refreshing for him to measure people's head fat and look at vaginas.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, not being an error.  He couldn't do that in hospice.  An error?  We're getting an error because he doesn't weigh enough for it to calculate the body.  That's an impossibility.  What if he just lays on it? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, that would work.  What if he just lays your belly on it?  What if we put Big A's head on the other side?  What?  They just sort of stared at each other while we waited for a reading.  John Richards outside?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Bring him into this.  He's part of the Celebrity Apprentice finale.  Oh, yeah?  This couldn't be any worse than watching Gary Busey and Meatloaf yell at each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like the Meatloaf.  He's out of his mind.  Yeah.  We had him on and we didn't realize how out of his mind he is. 
[02:59:00]  Is there a John about that?  I guess.  John Rich joins the show now?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  What happened to Patty's vagina?  I think it's still there.  It should be.  Can we do this, though?  I mysteriously forgot about it.  It should be.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  Join the hijinks.  Hi, John Rich.  How are you, sir?  I just saw you on TV.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people here.  You were just on the TV.  You're, you're, yeah, that commercial's everywhere.  I just saw you on TV.  TV.  Yeah.  Is this me?  Yes.  That's you right there.  Oh, that's you? 
[02:59:30]  Wow.  Welcome.  Got a stand.  Is your father a preacher?  Yes.  How did that affect you?  Where you at with the...  Religious guy?  Absolutely.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about this whole thing about a rapture happening?  A rapture tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Freaking everybody up.  A rapture happening tomorrow?  Yeah.  Not buying into that one.  Yeah.  Not buying into that one.  Too many things have to happen.  Yeah.  Not to happen.  Oh, really?  There hasn't been enough lead up yet?  Right.  We haven't even got started.  We're not evil enough or something?  We're pretty evil.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  What are they waiting for?  I think there's some evil going on.  Yeah.  You know.  I don't buy into it.  It's probably somebody trying to sell something, I'm sure.  Yeah.  What kind of reaction do you get in New York with the hat?  Yee-haw!  A lot of that?  Everywhere I go, but...  What about the hat?  What about the ring?  Look at that.  I got my blue gator boots on.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, because that really stands out in New York City.  I've noticed that.  What's that?  Just the hat.  Yeah.  I was having dinner last night, sitting outdoors, some little Italian joint in Soho, eating, 
[03:00:30]  and about every third person would stop and ask to get a picture, I guess, from seeing  me on Apprentice, or thought it was just novel that they saw a cowboy hat sitting there.  But either way, you don't see a lot of cowboy hats walking around in Soho.  No, it's true.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's not, you know, where I come from, that's part of...  We had hat trees in the back of the rooms at school.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My dad, you know, my dad put a cowboy hat on my hat when I was three and said, keep  this on your head, boy, or your face will burn. 
[03:01:00]  Now, when I was growing up in San Juan Capistrano, I was in a very equestrian city I grew up in.  And I used to wear, yeah, the straw.  That's the dress hat.  But I had, like, the straw one and the cowboy boots.  At what point in your life was there a question?  Were you cleaning out the stables?  I did.  I had to clean out stalls.  Okay, but I was going to say, you didn't have that upper crust vibe about you.  Yeah, yeah, I didn't.  I thought you were saying you were riding side saddle like a lady.  No, no, western, like a real person. 
[03:01:30]  Do you ride?  Oh, yeah.  I grew up riding.  Yeah.  I originally wanted to be a team roper in Texas.  Your rope, yeah.  Head him and heal him?  I was a healer.  Yeah?  Yeah, and then we moved to Tennessee.  My mother was in Tennessee, and so there wasn't a lot of rodeo around Nashville.  That's where I'm from.  Yeah?  Memphis.  Memphis?  Oh, excellent.  You ever get your fingers caught in a dally?  No, thank God.  I still have them all.  Yeah, yeah.  See, some of the old cowboys, they're, like, walking around.  Yeah, I got into a dally storm, and I couldn't.  Because you've got to wind the rope around the horn of the saddle, and sometimes their fingers 
[03:02:00]  get caught in there.  Oh, shit.  The bull just takes the slack out of the rope, and your fingers just pop right out.  Yeah.  And you'd see these old guys just roping still with fucking three fingers.  Jesus.  It's rough, man.  Tough guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the tough guy.  Oh, that's cool.  They're actually wearing, like, goalie masks now, finally.  Yeah, it is kind of odd to watch rodeo, because, again, doing that, and believe me, I was growing  up in an environment with adults who were drinking a lot and putting their children in  harm's way.  So I would be like, hey, you know, stay on this bull for eight seconds. 
[03:02:30]  And they would just throw us on these bulls and open up the gate and let us go.  And we'd fall off and have to run out of the arena.  But there was no Kevlar like they wear.  Now they wear chest Kevlar and helmets.  Do the bulls have guns?  No, actually.  But they do have horns.  And 2,000 pound feet.  Yeah.  And once you fall off, not if you fall off, once you fall off, you've got to run out of  there no matter how hurt you are, because this thing's going to come back at you. 
[03:03:00]  Doesn't that kind of make it not as exciting, though?  If the guy has Kevlar and a helmet, then I could do it.  Well, that's like the old school.  Old school is just, you know.  That's what I'm saying.  Old school is just get on and go.  Yeah.  But then a few guys got killed.  So they kind of.  Yeah, yeah.  A little chest trauma.  No, I saw a guy broke his entire face.  He got, like, knocked forward.  Oh, he went back and then the bulls came up on him.  And just pancaked his face.  It was brutal.  I mean, if you're going to do that, though, I kind of feel like, you know, you've got to  go in there wrong.  Did you do a lot of that growing up as a kid? 
[03:03:30]  I never got into riding bulls.  Did you do any, like, Jim Canna?  Smart man.  Barrel.  My sisters did barrels.  Dudes really don't ride barrels.  Wow.  Maybe you did.  I used to do a little cloverleaf, though.  Oh, did you?  Oh, when you were a kid.  What's that mean, cloverleaf?  It's like.  Oh, I like that.  I think he's saying you.  Oh, he's looking at you.  I know.  He's looking at you a little funny.  Maybe I could have done some more man.  My sister rode the barrels.  That's all I'm saying.  Pole bending and barrel.  Pole bending.  I didn't do pole bending. 
[03:04:00]  He's being polite to you.  Wait, when that horse is leaning down and your elbow is on the dirt.  You're never more alive.  Did you do it on a pony, you sissy?  No, I didn't.  I didn't.  Why couldn't you do pole bending?  You were curious he's sitting on them and sucking them?  That's uncalled for, sir.  John Ritz looked at you a little funny, though.  You know, I had to enter something and just shut up.  And those are the events that were open up. 
[03:04:30]  How old were you?  Jim Canna.  Like 12, 13, 14, 15, those years.  What is barrel riding?  You already had a mustache.  What is barrel riding?  It's that you go through timing poles and then you've got to go around three barrels.  Actually, it's that way, that way.  It's probably better to ask a woman, I think.  And the best time wins.  You've got to go around the barrel.  Is it right?  Side saddle?  No, not side saddle.  See what I've got to put up with?  I see what you're putting that way.  Just because I spent some of my formative years as an equestrian. 
[03:05:00]  John Ritz wants to say all this stuff to you.  It's not fair.  You were the prettiest girl in Salon Capistrano.  You'd think I was.  A little rough around the edges.  Where exactly are you from, sir?  Amarillo, Texas.  Texas.  Up in the Pan Amarillo.  I'm the ultimate cliche.  I grew up in a double-wide trailer in Tornado Alley.  Wow.  So there you go.  How many times was your house relocated?  I mean, we didn't have a basement or anything.  And so you'd see them coming, and it was always get in the bathtub and put the mattress over  your head.  I mean, I can't tell you how many times that happened. 
[03:05:30]  You ever seen F5?  Yeah.  I've seen.  One time I saw.  It's on my fork.  It's so flat out there, you can see in 20 miles in every direction.  Yeah.  So you can see tornadoes ripping through fields, and it's a clear blue sky over your head.  One time I saw a tornado go through a herd of cows, sucked them up in the sky, and dropped  them out all over the county.  And there were people out.  You'd go around, and there's cows snapped all up.  Looked like snapped pencil legs all over the place.  Holy shit.  You had to go out, and you had to shoot them. 
[03:06:00]  Because, I mean, they were laying out.  Wow, that is crazy.  Just snapped all over the place.  Yeah.  One time it rained frogs on us coming back from the photo church.  I never saw that episode.  Because they were just lifted up somewhere.  That didn't seem like the rapture.  That did seem very apocalyptic.  It seemed apocalyptic.  That might get you thinking.  My dad did a sermon on it, actually.  Raining frogs.  They got these things they call buffalo wallers, where the buffalo used to roll.  There was 30-some-odd million buffalo, and they would roll and actually wore the ground  down a couple of inches.  And the oil out of those buffalo hides actually has sealed the ground off for all these years. 
[03:06:30]  And when it rains, it'll hold about two or three inches of water.  And these toads by the billions just start breeding out in there.  And a tornado somewhere will rip through one of those buffalo wallers and then drop it out.  And one night, we're coming on from church, and the windshield wipers are flapping.  And it sounds like it's hailing, but it didn't have that crack sound to it.  It was more thuddy.  And it looked like there was oil all over the windshield.  My dad is slowing down, puts his high beams on.  He's like, what in the world is going on?  And finally, we stop in the middle of the road, and you see frogs bouncing off the hood 
[03:07:00]  of the car.  And he goes out in the road and picks one up.  And sure enough, it was raining frogs, and it was frog blood all over the car.  Oh.  All right.  That is insane.  So if the world's not going to end with that, it ain't ending tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the answer to that question.  Or today or any other.  That should have been the end right there.  Yeah.  Wow.  How do you think coming from Texas and stuff has helped you out with Apprentice?  Do you think that brought a certain quality that other people don't have?  Probably the culture of country music, for sure. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  It's a different mindset.  You know, it's a very individual kind of a situation.  You know, in country music, you make your music, and you go forward with what you do.  Being a road musician, I mean, I've been on the road for almost 20 years.  Wow.  So the grind of Celebrity Apprentice, it ground me up, too, but I was able to pace through  it, whereas some other people didn't know how to handle being that tired for that long.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  And then being in a band, you know, I've been big and rich.  I've been a lone star.  I know it takes more than one player to make a band, so I like being on a team and going 
[03:08:00]  at it.  Dealing with it, yeah.  I'm sorry, what's the big song for a lone star?  We had a lot of big songs.  That was the big, well, the...  Amaze was probably the biggest song.  That was your and Jill's song, right?  Oh, it was mine and Jill's song.  That's where I heard that song was from you guys.  Oh, that's a great tune.  I actually have that on my fucking iPod.  Yeah, yeah, that was...  I don't know why I had to curse to make it cool.  That's the kids love cursing.  The kids love cursing.  Hey, now, when you were coming up as a country singer, did you ever have, like, the...  perform behind the chicken wire?  Like, what sort of... 
[03:08:30]  Like, you did, right?  Absolutely.  Really horrific.  I performed the...  Probably the roughest bar I ever performed at was in Boaz, Louisiana, and it was a truck  stop that had a nightclub in it.  Oh, man.  Sure.  And it was a chicken wire bar.  It straight up had the chicken wire, and it was customary.  If they liked the song, they threw beer at you.  Not if they didn't like it, if they liked it.  So you wanted them to throw the beer at you, and we're shaking beer back at them through  the chicken wire going the other direction.  What did they do if they didn't like you? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  If they didn't like you, you'd just get the hell out of there.  Sure, yeah.  Is that one of those weird sort of...  That's why they break out the wire cutters.  That's one of those weird sort of trucker ecosystems where they have, like, lot lizard  prostitutes and, like, a diner and a nightclub.  It was similar to that.  One-stop shopping, yeah.  Cold beer, cigarette, strippers.  That's all on the same sign.  Yeah.  You seem uncommonly stable for someone who's been on Celebrity Apprentice.  Well, when you live through Gary Busey, it's hard to rattle your nerves. 
[03:09:30]  That should be the name of an album.  I live through Gary Busey.  Busey was at my house last weekend, and we watched the last episode of Celebrity Apprentice  together and smoked cigars and sat there and watched it.  And, listen, you know, he's a good person, but he is, he's crazy.  I mean, he'll tell you, I'm not all there, you know, which is fine, because, you know...  Really breaks the tension.  It's kind of a cool, it's a cool friend to have in your back pocket.  You just go, I know Gary Busey.  You know, if you ever want to go there, you can call Gary Busey, and it's a blast.  Be that crazy.  Correct.  Yeah, yeah, hang out like that.  What about Meat Loaf? 
[03:10:00]  Well, I never, I always wondered what kind of a person it must be that makes songs like  Bad Outta Hell, and Two Outta Three Ain't Bad, and can put those on the same, you know,  sing those in the same concert, and then you meet Meat Loaf, and he's either cussing mad,  or he's bawling his eyes out.  One or the other.  You go, makes perfect sense.  He's a true artist.  That's really how he is.  None of that was made up.  That's really him.  Yeah, because he comes off a little psycho.  He's not psycho.  He's just an emotional rollercoaster ride all the time.  He's a wreck. 
[03:10:30]  A little psycho.  I saw one clip from the show.  He was freaking out about that.  If he gets really mad, he goes to Psycho Mad.  Yeah, he was freaking out at Gary Busey for touching his paints.  Yeah, he thought he stole his paint.  He touched my motherfucking paints!  I'll fucking kill you!  These are my fucking paints!  What happened?  Really?  Yeah.  You're a grown person!  They called it the Meat Loaf Meltdown.  I was project manager when that happened and had to diffuse that situation.  It was crazy.  But being in, you said, like, being in bands, you do deal with conflicts with people. 
[03:11:00]  You know, it's like, oh, crap.  You're like a teacher.  Gary Busey, did you touch Meat Loaf's paints?  Can't we all just...  Gary, where's Meat Loaf's paints?  In the corner.  Meat Loaf, calm down.  Both of you.  We have a challenge to win.  Come on.  Gary, stop fucking the paints.  Everybody turn your back, and we just want the paints to be back on the table.  We're going to have a timeout.  When we...  That's about right.  Yeah, but like with fans, you have to deal with people you absolutely don't like, whether  you don't like them forever or don't like them for that day or something like that. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, you're getting a fight over what the song, what the single should be, you know,  whatever.  There's a million different things.  The thing that kept me, you know, I'm in the final two.  This thing's live on Sunday.  The finale's going to happen live.  And if you win, you get another quarter of a million dollars for your charity, which  is just a huge sum of money.  And so far, I've raised over $800,000 for St. Jude Children's Hospital.  Wow.  So if I win, I go over a million bucks.  That's awesome.  That's noble.  It's a huge amount of money.  So the thing that kept me focused through all that insanity that we're sitting here talking 
[03:12:00]  about was, remember, you're here for the charity.  You know, you're not here to be dramatic or engage crazy people.  Who else is with you?  Who's the other guy?  Marlee Matlin.  Marlee.  Marlee Matlin, who's also raised a million bucks.  You know, she's deaf.  She's won an Academy Award.  She might get sympathy because she's deaf.  I don't know.  Sympathy is really not what she is.  She don't like sympathy.  I understand.  She's a tough, tough competitor, and it's a horse race.  I don't think anybody has really called it either way, and we're going to have to hash  it out Sunday.  How was it with Donald Trump there? 
[03:12:30]  He's a character, huh?  It was a lot of fun.  You know, it was great.  It was fantastic.  He's funny.  So many things that he said that didn't make the edit.  I mean, this guy, no filter between what he's thinking and what he's saying, for better  or worse.  You know, I mean, he just, he says what he's thinking all the time, which I kind of like  that.  You know exactly what you're dealing with.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, kind of like you guys, you know.  Yeah, that's right. 
[03:13:00]  What did you think of the whole running for president thing?  Did you think?  I'm disappointed that he's not running because I wanted to see him debate.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I wanted to see him not be autonomous for a second and have to go head-to-head with other  people and just see what he says and see what makes him tick.  That really would have turned the president's race into a reality show.  It would have been interesting to see it.  It really would have turned into a crazy reality show.  But it doesn't matter now.  I know.  I don't know who's getting my vote now.  My opponent is a degenerate.  Yeah, he would just say that.  When he got into it with Rosie O'Donnell at one time, it was just, it was hilarious. 
[03:13:30]  He just was like a little kid.  He just, she's fat.  He just insulted.  He really was brutal with her.  You lean a little right of center politically?  I'm a constitutionalist is what I would say.  I think over 90% of our politicians in both parties have jacked it up so bad.  And it's been going on for decades.  I'm probably like everybody else, just going, can we please just start over and get out 
[03:14:00]  of our business a little bit as American people.  Just get out of our business for a second.  That's what I'm talking about.  You know, I'm a trailer park kid who just worked really hard and now I hire a bunch of  people, you know, because I worked really hard and I did well.  I had a great career thanks to country music fans out there.  And now I hire people and I run a business and I don't like it when people tell me how to  run my business.  And how about, yeah, how about you're, you're, you made something yourself and now penalize  me for achieving the American dream, employing people. 
[03:14:30]  Well, I'm one of those evil, I'm one of those evil guys to a lot of people.  Cause they say, Oh, he makes, he makes, this guy makes good money.  So we're going to knock his head off with taxes.  They've demonized people that make money.  I don't, listen, you're talking to a kid who grew up in a trailer park.  Okay.  I did not have a silver spoon.  I had nothing.  So I'm a good example of how that is not cool.  Meanwhile, there's people acting like babies getting, I understand your point though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The adult baby.  Yeah.  The guy in the, in the crib.  Work. 
[03:15:00]  Work for a living.  I can't stand.  No, I'm, I'm, I'm in the same mindset as you on, on that one.  I, I like, uh, our freedoms that are spelt out in the constitution.  I can't stand when the government steps in and starts regulating everything and, uh, trying  to get their, uh, ideology on, on, on us when, you know, we were given these rights and, uh,  and then the, the rest of the time they spent trying to take them away.  I'm a big, uh, number two guy.  Yeah.  I'm a big second amendment.  Talk a lot of it.  Yeah, I know.  Talk a lot.  I knew.  I, I saw those wheels are turning in Jimmy's head. 
[03:15:30]  Uh, and, and now, now Texas, you're, you're pretty, uh, well, I live in Tennessee now  and Texas and Nashville, but yeah, I mean, I have carry permit, but you know what?  I've got nut jobs out there that I've got orders of protection against people because  you know, you're out in the spotlight.  There's, there's, there's weirdos running around, man.  I hear you don't know what, you know, they don't mean well.  Some people don't.  So I got a 15 month old son, you know, and a wife and I'm not, I'll be damned if anybody's 
[03:16:00]  going to come up and hurt them.  That's a man's man.  He's going to protect his family.  You can't call 911 and think, uh, instantly someone's going to appear.  You protect your family and yourself.  That's what the number one thing is.  Explain this to me.  Oh, mother-tackle doctrine.  I, I, I support people owning guns, but I'm terrified of them because I didn't grow up  with them.  I don't understand the whole, because you have kids, now you got to keep the gun somewhere  and the bullets somewhere else.  So what do you do when the, the, the hatchet man comes in?  I can tell you what I do.  Are you running around the house? 
[03:16:30]  Let me tell you what my bedroom looks like.  Oh yeah.  At least this part of it, uh, about six and a half feet above, uh, above the floor line.  So where I have to reach up to grab it, there's a, uh, there's a pump shotgun with six rounds  of buckshot in it.  And there's a, and there's a, and there's a 45 with hollow points hanging right underneath  it.  Oh, that's great.  See?  And there's no ladder where anybody can get up there and grab it.  And I, I have to stand on my tippy toes to grab it.  But if a bad guy comes in my house, he's in trouble.  Yeah.  That's, oh, see, that's great. 
[03:17:00]  Pardon me.  Pardon me for wanting to protect my family.  As I was getting older, my father, uh, would educate me, uh, as far as the guns went.  And the number one thing was, don't touch the damn things when I was a kid.  And then he, uh, you know, as I got a little older, he started showing me how they're used.  And I grew up with them ever since I was a, you know, a kid, uh, uh, and safety was always  paramount.  But they're not toys.  You know, and they're not for everybody.  And if you're not comfortable with them, I suggest don't own one.  Don't own one.  Is there any home invasions in Texas?  I mean, you have to be out of your fucking mind. 
[03:17:30]  There's not many.  Hey, let's go in there and try to take his microwave.  You know, that's a good point.  Exactly.  Because some states that crack down on that, there's lots of home invasions because they  know that nobody in the house, that they're the, only the bad guys got games.  Try getting a, try getting a carry permit in D.C.  Can't.  Chicago.  Chicago.  New York.  And these are the highest.  Los Angeles.  Gun crime cities in the country.  Yet you're not even allowed to have them.  So where does this strict gun control come in?  It's all a bunch of bull.  I never understood, like, I think if there's, maybe because it's such a dense population that 
[03:18:00]  everybody, if everybody was packing heat with the whole trying to get into the Lincoln  Tunnel at five o'clock in the, I think maybe there's something to that.  Like, when you live, you live in Texas and it's spread out.  Like you said, if you call the cops.  Dallas, Houston.  Yeah, you're right.  These cities don't get traffic jams.  Yeah, they're huge.  You know what it is?  Come on.  Some sort of cute towns you have down there.  Yeah, a little cute town like Houston.  Oh my God.  With all those football fields between your sky.  But I've been there.  You're going to compare that to New York?  I got you.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:18:30]  I got you.  Jesus Christ.  Goddamn tumbleweeds blowing through your fucking downtown.  But you're talking about a culture that grew up with guns.  Not like, all of a sudden, if you just dropped a bunch of guns in New York.  But you can't do that.  Yeah, obviously, you've got to be a safe, responsible owner.  That's the key thing.  When you talk to some of these liberal politicians that want to take guns away from everybody,  they treat everybody like a gun-wielding maniac.  Like, if people are allowed to carry guns, it's going to be the Old West.  It's like, no. 
[03:19:00]  Except those same politicians have armed guards everywhere they go.  Yeah, absolutely.  They're the ones that allow guns.  You think they'd want a guard with nothing but a stick?  Yeah.  Of course not.  When somebody comes up to them with an illegally owned gun.  Well, the thing is, if you outlaw guns, then no one will have them anymore.  See the bad guys have them.  They just did it.  I love that.  Get a bumper sticker.  Yeah.  That's a fucking cross-eyed look.  From my cold dead end.  Yeah, if you outlaw heroin, no one's going to do it.  Did anyone ever pry that gun out of Charlton Heston's hand?  Yeah, right? 
[03:19:30]  There did come a time where I guess somebody had...  NRA member for life, my friend.  I'm a lifer.  I'm in.  I love it.  I got my card right here.  Absolutely.  See, I like this guy.  I like this.  The second I'm able to retire from this god-forsaken job, I am leaving New York and going to either  Texas, Arizona, somewhere...  Come to Nashville.  Nashville's a great town.  Nashville's a phenomenal town.  Lots of music, lots of sports, lots of fun.  I actually went to Nashville a couple of years ago.  Yeah, great town. 
[03:20:00]  You're going to move out there, Anthony, after all these years of fighting all the liberals  out here.  This will be like the Truman Show for you.  This is totally perfect.  Believe me.  I've been fighting the battle here, and it's the hardest thing.  Because no one listens.  This is liberal-minded crap.  This left-wing garbage.  And they don't listen to his racist rants.  It's just unbelievable.  You're painting yourself out like you're this fucking hero.  I'm not a racist.  I'm a realist.  I agree with your stance on gun control, but your stance is on humanity. 
[03:20:30]  They're just reprehensible.  We also devote some time to looking at a 56-year-old woman's vagina.  There are some social issues that need to be addressed.  Put your eyebrows down and say what you've got to say.  There are certain social issues that need to be addressed with a little more honesty and  Anthony, you're a silly, silly man.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  You're a silly, silly man.  That's all I'm saying.  Well, God bless you.  Thank you guys for having me.  Good luck on the show, man.  Thanks, man.  Best of luck on the show.  Sunday Live.  Tune me in.  I appreciate you guys having me.  You guys are great.  But what job do you get if you win? 
[03:21:00]  Best of luck, man.  I'm confused by that.  He doesn't have to work.  He's a celebrity apprentice.  Trump's supposed to hire you.  He could bitch slap Donald Trump with his money.  He doesn't hire you, but he does give you a quarter million for your charity.  For the charity.  So that's awesome.  Straight children's hospital.  St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Yeah, Memphis.  Based in Memphis.  Take care of them if you can.  God bless you all for having me.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  John Rich is going to win this thing.  Thanks.  Team John Rich right here.  Thank you, guys.  All right, John.  Great job.  Thanks a lot.  That raining frog story is amazing. 
[03:21:30]  It's cool, man.  Thank you, man.  When I go down south and I, you know, after the show, you just talk to those guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we're so removed from nature.  Even though we're outside, we've just paved over it.  And they've got these, you know.  We've built buildings paved over everything.  Oh, I love this.  I'll come out there and this damn badger starts coming out.  You just jaws on the ground.  When was the last time you were getting into the parking garage and a badger jumped out  at you?  Yeah, you're just like, what?  It doesn't happen.  But there, it's like, like you said, 20 miles. 
[03:22:00]  You're seeing to where the earth curves.  And that's why you can't see any further.  And the amount of wildlife and shit that's out there is frightening.  You have to live in a mobile home because it's got, like, it's pointless to have a station  area.  This is going to get blown up.  It will get destroyed.  You need a home that's used to being thrown around.  Fuck it.  Get a new one.  You live down in the kind of woodsy area, don't you?  Yeah, absolutely.  Where we are is in the mountains.  Tennessee.  You're in the mountains.  Another Tennessee guy.  Yeah? 
[03:22:30]  Do you have any fucking hostages?  You got 12 games.  Are you one of those mountain men that just kidnap young girls and lock them in dungeons?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Oh, Uncle Dr. Steve.  He didn't deny it.  I know.  Dr. Why would he?  He was great.  That was great.  Really great.  He was very personable.  Cool guy, man.  Very gentlemanly.  Like I said, uncommonly stable for someone who's on a reality show.  Yeah.  They usually like to cast complete psychos.  I guess they needed him to lay like the whole Busey and meatloaf thing. 
[03:23:00]  They need that dynamic.  Someone's got to anchor him.  Yeah.  Hold all those people there.  He's got to loosely tether them to humanity.  Can you imagine if the Donald ran the country?  Oh, good gosh.  Don't even say it.  I think it would go a little.  I know.  He'd probably say, uh, Qaddafi, you fie it.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah.  That would kill on Hollywood squares.  Oh, God.  I think it'd be great to have a president.  Jim Norton for the block.  I think it'd be great to have a president who just came on and said, you know what? 
[03:23:30]  Fuck that guy.  Like, whoa.  That was, yeah, yeah.  I would love to see someone.  When will that happen?  I don't know.  I thought that was going to happen before the black one.  Fuck that guy in the face.  Look at Bill.  Bill loves my racism.  I wasn't racist.  I thought it was kind of funny.  Teasing, of course.  Dr. Steve, all right.  So, what did we accomplish today?  Nothing.  Very little.  But I did very little.  We did fine.  We did fine.  I'm doing it.  I'm doing it.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  Dr. Steve sounds like cicadas.  Dr. Steve just, he took the thing he was going to read.  He just threw his arms up and walked away from the night.  He's like, yeah, fuck it.  No.  Come on.  We want to hear what you have to say.  What are you going to say?  Yeah, go ahead.  Read it.  Do you got to read it?  No, the, uh, you're not shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Wrap it up.  We're almost done with the show.  The error message that we were getting from the body fat analyzer said that, um, the body  fat percentage was out.  What was it?  Was it, uh, too high? 
[03:24:30]  He crumbled it up and threw it away.  Was it too high?  He doesn't care.  What was the name of that thing we were trying to get?  The what?  Fluids.  The, uh, speculum.  The, uh, speculum.  The, uh, speculum.  What was the problem was his ears were dirty and there was fluid seeping.  It was like a seeping.  Seeping.  Seeping.  There was ear seepage.  Capillaries are fascinating and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,  It's just funny.  What happened?  I don't know why.  It was outside the measurement range. 
[03:25:00]  Nah.  Oh.  Outside the measurement range.  Yeah.  Because the circumference, uh, wraps around.  Um, assuming that this show ever ends, we're going to be doing a, uh, mini weird medicine  between 10 and 11.  Oh, okay.  The shit hour.  Well, we, it's the excrement hour.  Oh, right.  The excrement hour.  Sure.  Dr. C's getting a little ahead of himself.  It's going to be after Opie and Anthony live with Dr. Stephen P.A. John.  Yeah.  Oh, are you involved in this at all? 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  And what capacity?  What about Bobo?  Bobo's not happy with you guys.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you guys missed that when I was out there.  No, he's, he's angry now.  All right, bring him in for a second.  He was angry that stalker Patty came in before him.  I was trying to say, Sinatra always went on last.  Oh, shit, yeah.  He's the headliner.  Bobo, why are you fucking mad at us?  What's wrong?  Diva.  No, it's just, I came here and I thought, and I, I thought I was going to be snubbed again.  Well, you were.  It looked like.  Yeah.  We're just, we're just having you comment on your snub. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Oh, it just feels the worst.  It ain't, it ain't going to get to me, all right?  And how could it not get to me, all right?  This Saturday, I'll be, I'm going to be going to the game on Saturday.  Oh, I thought you were plugging a gig or something.  What game?  The Mets versus Yankees.  Yeah, huh?  How did Patty get in before you?  That was, we didn't want that.  Yeah, what happened there?  Yeah, why do you think she got in?  Was she talking smack that she was in here before you?  Yeah.  No.  No?  How's your hair looking these days?  My hair's okay.  Let me see.  Nice. 
[03:26:30]  It's not okay.  Filt your head down a little.  Oof.  Okay.  That's not fair.  He's got a hat on.  I'm missing it.  No, I understand.  Looks like shimp.  Not that.  Are you coloring it?  No.  Yes, you are.  A little bit.  Just for idiots?  Oh, God.  Ah, shit, Jimmy.  Are you a little bit?  A little bit of just for men in there?  No, I'm not.  You leave a little gray on the side to show experience, yet youthful. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, salt and pepper, they say.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  Glad you came in.  Lead and chips.  I mean, you know, this is why they're not bringing you in, dude.  I was telling you, you've got to be the headliner.  You've got to close strong.  Yeah, you've got to crush it.  You're coming in.  Crush it.  What did you have for today, by the way?  Yeah, what did you have?  Let your hands go.  Come on.  Just start talking.  Well, what I had today, I would have wanted to have come in here doing a one-man band.  There was a situation, though.  Oh?  Yeah, my mother uses those pots and pans. 
[03:27:30]  Ah.  And?  Right.  I could break those, all right.  All right.  She should have used them on her belly during a certain fucking gestation period.  Sorry, Chris Hardwick.  That's okay.  I'm reading about the human head.  I'm sorry, Chris Hardwick.  That's all right.  We're talking to someone that lacks one.  So, wait.  That's a joke.  I also got to say, at this whole end of the world thing, I got a comment about this one. 
[03:28:00]  A really good one.  And I think this is going to be the biggest hoax since the vault of Al Capone.  Whoa.  Good reference.  You are calling out the news, really.  Come on.  Let's have a religious voice.  It's going to be the biggest hoax.  Yeah, I wish I had it.  It's going to be the biggest hoax than that, Y2K, and 2012 combined.  Well, how do you know 2012 is a hoax?  It hasn't happened yet.  Yeah, it is true.  Yeah, well, that one's going to be an even bigger hoax.  That's true. 
[03:28:30]  Why are you moving like Ray Charles when you talk?  Right.  It's just an impulse thing.  But it's going to be that big of a hoax thing that people are saying,  I should have paid the bill, all right?  I bet you there's going to be a lot of people that didn't pay their bills  because they thought this whole thing was going to happen tomorrow  and they realize they didn't when they realize there's still an even more debt.  Whoa.  I don't think there's enough words in that.  Yeah, yeah.  That wasn't wordy enough.  It's probably because he's looking at a teleprompter on the Upper East Side. 
[03:29:00]  He's got a fucking three-mile stare.  It really is, man.  Where are you looking?  I also got to say that this physical fitness challenge, for those of you who think...  That's a great question.  Yes.  Bobo, where are you looking right now?  Exactly.  Wow, you see his eyes as full.  Yeah, he just came in.  That was weird, right?  You're kind of looking...  Regarding that physical fitness challenge, anybody who thinks...  Bobo, where are you looking right now?  At you guys.  Yes.  At you guys.  No, which person? 
[03:29:30]  Where's the other Bobo looking?  At you guys.  No, at you, Opie, direct.  At you guys.  That's what it sits in front of me.  At you guys.  And I want to say, for those of you who didn't think I'm going to win that physical fitness challenge...  Yeah.  You're not.  No, I am going to win.  You're not going to win.  You're not going to win.  I'm going to win or go down fighting.  That's what you'll do.  Fighting.  Can you do some push-ups right now to show...  Yeah, you got it. 
[03:30:00]  Let's see how hard you're going.  I love Iraq.  Oops.  Don't fuck the floor.  Here we go.  I had wondered what happened to Rick Moranis.  All right, one.  No, no, you can't touch the ground.  You can't touch the ground with the rest of your body.  Back straight.  Back straight.  There's one.  There's two.  All the way down.  All the way down.  Three.  Chest to the floor.  Ah, Jesus.  And up.  Now you've got to start over again.  And up.  Don't rest on the floor.  What's wrong, Danny?  You want to fly jets? 
[03:30:30]  You're not doing push-ups.  You want to fly jets?  I don't think that's...  I want your D-O-R.  What?  He's doing like a worm.  Yeah, you're...  He hasn't done one push-up.  Yeah, you're doing like a break-dance move.  Oh, what the hell is that?  What is that?  Keep that...  Bobo, you don't even know how to do one push-up.  Come on, Bobo.  What's that one?  How many is that?  That's one full one.  That's one.  You got one in.  Come on, Bobo.  Give us three.  Give us three.  Come on.  Go, go, go, go.  Push.  Come on.  Push.  Push.  Push.  No, that's a girl push-up.

He said he's doing the worm.  He's resting in the middle.  That's all right.  He's tired.  All right.  Let's see sit-ups.

He's ripping off your act there, Jimmy.  Your act.  Yeah, everybody wants to get in the act.  Chick-cha-cha.  I woke up thinking about that yesterday.  That embarrassing Michael J.  Fox scene when he's with Kirk Douglas. 
[03:33:00]  And he's doing the Jimmy Durante impression on the steps.  Fucking humiliating.  Who's doing it?  Michael J.  Fox.  He's playing.  Kirk Douglas plays a millionaire and he thinks everybody in the family is out to get his money.  So Michael J.  Fox is trying to entertain his grandfather with the old Jimmy Durante impression.  What's worse, that or Goldie Hawn singing the football song in that movie?  Wildcats.  Wildcats.  That was terrible.  Horrible.  But at least I could fantasize that Wesley Snipes might have fucking put a finger in her backside  and just raped her for private Benjamin. 
[03:33:30]  No, that's more humiliating than Michael J. Fox one.  Much more.  I didn't see that one.  I saw, I thought I saw all this movie.  Oh, it's awful.  Everybody wants to get in the act.  Oh, yeah, I remember that movie.  It destroys something in you.  It's fucking awful.  I have forgotten about that movie, but I think it's great that you're still carrying around rage.  Dude, it's one of the weird things.  It's not even anger.  It just came off the other day.  It's like a, ugh.

[03:38:00]  Haunting.  Definitely.  Haunting.  Literally haunting.  This is going to haunt my nightmare.  The smell of your skin, the taste of your kiss.  Your breath.  The way you whisper in the dark.  I'm going to kill you.  Your hair's all around me.  Baby, you surround me.  I see her body parts all over the room.  You touch every place in my heart.  She surround us with her legs over there, her hands over there.
