<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Charlie Sheen's potential return to "Two and a Half Men," comparing his chaotic career trajectory to their own past, less-structured broadcasting style.  This transitioned into a highly critical and vulgar commentary on Wendy Williams' performance on "Dancing with the Stars," filled with offensive and demeaning physical descriptions.  The hosts also touched upon other "Dancing with the Stars" contestants, mentioning Ralph Macchio and Chris Jericho.

The bulk of the show centered around a listener, Sam, whose fiancée, Jess, was on a nine-day work trip to Brazil with her boss and colleagues.  The hosts and numerous callers engaged in extensive, sexually explicit speculation about Jess's potential infidelity, particularly with a man named "Juan," fueled by sexually suggestive jokes and innuendo,  references to specific sexual acts, and  comparisons to previous Opie and Anthony experiences in tropical locations.  One detailed anecdote involved a woman performing oral sex on a boat captain during a Turks and Caicos booze cruise.  Other vacation stories involving skydiving, trapeze artists, and various encounters with men in tropical locales were also shared.  Callers contributed anecdotes about their own partners' infidelities, including a caller whose wife was attracted to young Brazilian men, and another whose girlfriend left him for four black men in Jamaica. The listener, Sam, also expressed concerns about Jess's safety and security in Brazil.  The show also featured multiple voicemails and text messages from an angry ex-girlfriend of Sam, detailing the fallout from their breakup.  Sammy Hagar's claim of alien abduction was briefly discussed.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to Anthony's stalker, who left numerous lengthy and increasingly erratic voicemails.  These voicemails were played extensively, revealing the stalker's obsessive behavior, including a 300-mile drive to Anthony's home. Listeners successfully guessed individuals mentioned in the voicemails (Ann Coulter and Jodie Sweetin), winning prizes.  A therapist even called in to offer analysis of the stalker's mental state.  This segment included tangents on Charlie Sheen's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, William Shatner's 80th birthday, and a video of a woman claiming to have a religious orgasm.  Highly offensive language was used throughout this segment.

The show concluded with a segment covering several loosely connected topics.  This included discussion of an upcoming staff meeting and Steve Lauder's absence; a vulgar exchange about Mars’ urination habits;  the unexpected popularity of Rebecca Black's "Friday"; a segment featuring an annoying child fashion designer; and a listener's recommendation of a humorous honey badger video.  Future show segments, including a death metal version of "Friday" and further discussion of previous topics, were mentioned.  No guests appeared on the show beyond the regular hosts and staff.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few minutes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  And we're off and running.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  Yeah.  Well, it looks like Charlie Sheen's winning because, uh...  I don't know how this is happening.  CBS wants him back.  Yeah.  Boy, that must have really, uh...  Been a great feeling for the CBS brass to go, 
[00:01:30]  You know, we really have to send the word out that we want him back.  Everything he's been saying.  They're losing too much money.  I bet you the stockholders got to Les Moonves and the rest of the gang and said,  Get this asshole back.  Get him back.  We don't care.  If he wants to do his coke on the set, we don't care.  Get him back.  Like, we don't care if he's fucking...  What he's doing.  He's shooting up heroin on set.  Get him back.  I think they wanted to sit back and see if the guy could sober up a little bit. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And I believe that's what Charlie is doing.  Yeah.  And they said, Okay.  Now we've got to get him back.  Because you can tell most of it's just an act.  It wasn't at first.  No, at first I think he was legitimately fucked up on drugs and booze.  Sure.  And then he kind of quit cold turkeys.  He was a bit manic.  And now he's settling in.  Yeah.  To what he is, I guess, normally.  And I think CBS sees that.  It goes, Oh, okay.  That's the guy we know and we can deal with.  Yeah.  Because now they want him back.  Charlie Sheen and CBS are reportedly close to a deal that would see the actor return to two and a half men, sources said Monday. 
[00:02:30]  So what about his stupid road show?  He's doing an O&A road show.  He's still doing it, I would gather.  An O&A road show, meaning where we just go, Hey, we're going to be here, here, and here, and we have nothing planned.  And we don't know what we're doing.  We're just going to cart some people out on stage.  I think Charlie Sheen's ripping us off.  Who, who, who, who.  Because that's what we did.  Yeah.  You just kind of wing it on stage and hope something works.  That's all we needed to do back then. 
[00:03:00]  And that's what Charlie Sheen's doing.  Is he regretting the fact that he's hitting the road?  I don't think so.  He's probably making upwards of seven mil.  Yeah.  But if CBS turns around and says, Look, we're going to give you a little extra for being such a good boy.  He's going to be like, Oh, fuck.  I still got to go on the road.  They'll work around it, I'm sure.  Yeah.  They'll work around that.  So then what it would amount to is he'd still make the money from the show and all the money he's made while he's off the show.  That's a lot of money.  So I hate to say it, but is he winning? 
[00:03:30]  I think he's kind of winning now.  I don't like that.  I think he's kind of winning again.  That sucks.  He started off winning, and then he was definitely losing.  Now I'm starting to think he's winning again.  Winning again.  CBS has offered him his job back.  This was a rumor yesterday, but now they're starting to say this is real.  Discussion's ongoing.  Not a done deal.  NBC reporter Jeff Rossin tweeted Monday, citing sources close to Sheen.  Earlier Monday report.  All right, whatever.  You've heard the rest. 
[00:04:00]  But it looks like something's in the works.  It's too late for this season, right?  I would think so, unless they...  No, no, it would be too late, right?  I think so.  I think the season ends in May.  In me.  And then Charlie Sheen did a walk-on on Jimmy Kimmel yesterday.  Charlie Sheen.  He did?  What did he do?  Anything?  Unfortunately, I didn't stay up late enough to see this.  Nothing exciting?  But we got a couple clips real quickly for everybody, in case you missed it.  I found myself just webbing it all night. 
[00:04:30]  I barely watched television.  I watched like Heavy and a few freak shows.  But for the most part, I'm just on the web all the time.  Can you go behind that and see if it's plugged in?  All right.  That's great.  That's whatever.  It's this one.  Is this thing plugged in?  Right here.  Oh, wait.  Something's flashing now.  Got to give it a good jiggle?  Yeah.  The jiggle worked.  All right.  Mars.  The jiggle worked.  The jiggle.  It's like the handle on the fucking toilet.  What were you saying?  I'm sorry.  I was distracted because this was off. 
[00:05:00]  That I just watch.  I'm on the web a lot.  I don't even fucking...  Watch the TV.  Watch TV.  A lot of shit, too, I get from the web and I throw it up on that fucking Apple TV.  It goes right up on my screen and I watch shit like that.  Yeah.  I don't really watch TV either.  No.  Like regular TV now.  I'm not watching it.  I was getting beat up for commenting that Wendy Williams looks like a dude.  She did?  Yeah.  That's not what I was getting beat up about.  I was getting beat up about watching Dance with the Stars. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, right.  Okay.  You watch a lot of girl shows.  Only faggans who watch TV.  You're gay.  Only gay people would do that.  Is that what they sound like?  How about, asshole, I was walking by the fucking TV and it's a big pop culture show and  I said, holy shit, Wendy Williams looks like a dude.  I gotta tweet this.  I'm not sitting there watching the actual show.  You weren't sitting going, oh, she's looking good.  Look at the dance steps. 
[00:06:00]  I'm a big girl.  Fucking idiots.  I would actually love to hear somebody say that in that voice.  Oh, that's how I see these dumb things.  They probably are.  You know, you read it in text form.  Because they're ignorant.  Ignat.  They just assume a lot.  You must have a kid who's a star-gay.  Wow.  Yeah, that's what's going on.  Yep.  Sucking the cock and watching Dancing with the Stars.  That's what's going on because I took a little peek.  That's what we're all doing, right? 
[00:06:30]  And saw that monster in a dress trying to dance last night.  Yep.  Yep, that's it.  Yeah.  You got it.  You're right.  So she wasn't looking very feminine?  Oh, my God.  She looked like a refrigerator with dancing shoes.  Something like horrible.  Like, she's like, she's like, I want to say she's square, but because she's tall, she's  like rectangular.  But not, yeah, she's like got shoulders.  She's dressed.  She looks like a linebacker or something.  Kind of like a refrigerator.  You know what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to stick with that.  A refrigerator with arms and dancing shoes on. 
[00:07:00]  Was she making wacky faces?  Because she's got a manly face, too.  Was she making like, like, woo, like trying to look like a girl face?  That would mean sitting down and really studying the program.  But like I said, like I said, I danced across my living room floor.  Did you do a little, like, two step across the floor to watch you, Dancing with the Stars?  Look, because you want to dance with the stars.  That's pretty gay. 
[00:07:30]  Fucking idiots.  Just mindless idiots.  Yeah.  Not all of you.  Yeah.  Just a small percentage.  You looked up from a man's pubis for a second to see Dancing with the Stars through his curly, gnarly, puby hair.  Yeah, that's it.  And then right back to balls.  Because that's what you are if you watch Dancing with the Stars, according to a very, very tiny percent of people that follow me on Twitter. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, you'll love it.  Gotta love it.  I didn't even see the rest of it, to be honest.  I saw, I did.  What'd you switch to in real housewives?  Gay.  Hey, Kirk, Kim Kardashian.  For a guy who watches a lot of girl shows.  Shut up.  Fucking idiots.  I did take a peek at Ralph Macchio, though.  He's got a weird hair thing going on.  Does he?  Where was he?  He's Dancing with the Stars, too.  Oh, he is?  Okay.  Well, I wouldn't know that, because... 
[00:08:30]  I'm not gay!  That's the worst voice ever.  But I know, like, the guy writing that's gotta be pushing 50.  That's...  What, do we?  I did fucking...  Gay.  I didn't see Chris Jerk.  I didn't see the rest of them.  I saw Wendy Williams, because she's such a fucking train wreck to watch.  Was that when you were replacing your tampons?  Right. 
[00:09:00]  Like...  I love the gay...  The guy yelling gay voice.  It's like we're 15 again.  That's like 15-year-old bullshit.  All right, this is it, huh?  So that's when...  Oh, God.  Why is she trying to look like a fucking sexy or something?  She's a monster.  Hey, Tony, you dancing tonight?  Oh, they gotta play every woman just to remind the people?  All right.  I didn't even know she danced to this, because honestly, when I was watching, the sound was 
[00:09:30]  down.  I didn't know she danced to I'm Every Woman.  Why were you listening to Medina?  Because gay...  She, uh...  Wow.  She should not be dancing to I'm Every Woman.  She should not be dancing.  She's the furthest thing from Every Woman.  Look how big her fucking legs are.  She is a giant woman.  She is truly Every Woman in Mass.  That they're...  Wow.  Wendy and Tony.  And she's not even fat. 
[00:10:00]  She's just massively large.  She's tripping the sun fantastic.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  The light.  But it's the sun, because she's huge.  I know people aren't completely buying into it, but I really think she looks like Hermione  like a black version of Hermann Munster.  But other people don't see that one yet.  I'll lead, Lily.  I'll lead.  Could you cast a spell, Grandpa, to make me dance better?  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:10:30]  That's like the smallest dress she can have on with that size body.  She's more manly than the man dancer or the male dancer there.  She should do, like, a Mexican hat dance, but throw her wig on the ground and just start  dancing around it.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Wouldn't that be cool?  With, you know, that hair that would be all, like, nasty and oily underneath that net that  goes over the head that the extensions are on?  I don't know.  You know, I don't even know why we beat her up so much, because I hear she's cool with 
[00:11:00]  us, but...  I am.  And she used to do radio, but she's like, I'd pay to see her in a...  Oh, boy.  This is gonna...  Get that bell ready, but this is not what I mean.  All right.  I would pay to see her in a zoo.  Oh, jeez.  As an attraction.  Like some kind of exhibit.  Yes, but not for the reason you're thinking.  Not for some horrible...  But I'm just telling you, hit the bell just in case.  Just to cover our bases.  You could say it, because it's...  Her body type is just that of something far beyond a human being. 
[00:11:30]  She's...  Her body's very intimidating, too.  Yeah.  Like it's...  Like the parts are too big.  Are those her real tits?  No.  Come on.  I don't know.  Some fatty bitches get them big tits, and if they lose weight...  But she's not...  I'm telling you, she's not fat.  Did you see the bikini video?  We've shown it a few times.  Yeah.  She's just really large.  Everything is just big on her.  Yeah.  And not in a fat way, I'm telling you.  You've seen the bikini thing, right?  She comes out of the water looking all sexy. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, God.  Would she bat a seal around and then go back in?  You haven't seen this?  I don't know.  This is scaring me.  You haven't seen this?  Wendy Williams shows off her hot bikini pics.  You've never seen this video?  Hot bikini pics.  No, the video you gotta see.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, here it is.  Okay.  She comes out of the water in front of her kid.  See, she's not fat.  Just everything is large.  All right.  It's just big. 
[00:12:30]  I don't know what it is.  She's like the incredible 50th foot woman or something.  Huh?  Yeah, she's really tall.  She's giant.  Like, if you put a regular girl next to that, you'd be like, oh my God, she's giant.  Yeah, and if you put my head and your head on her chest, her boobs would be bigger than that.  Oh, yeah.  They're gigantic.  They're giant and probably really, like, hard.  Hard in a bad way.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  I don't think those are the implants that feel supple.  Kind of like a stress ball.  You would squeeze them and they would kind of, your fingerprints would stay.  Stay in for a little while.  Stay in the booth for a little while.  Yeah, yeah.  And then come out.  Slowly come back out, like that fucking posturepedic material.  Yeah.  That space age material.  There it is.  There it is.  You could jump on one tit while your partner's on another and they'd never feel it.  Right.  You could place a glass of wine on her tit, jump on the other, and it wouldn't even shake. 
[00:13:30]  That dumb commercial.  Yeah, I know.  Let me say hi to Matt in New Hampshire.  Matt, what's up?  Matt.  Things I learned by listening to O.B. and Anthony.  I can talk this morning.  But much like, I'm sorry, much like O.B., I was just strolling through and I saw Wendy  Williams on TV.  My wife says, oh, I thought that was RuPaul.  I'm like, no, I think it was Wendy Williams.  And she says, how do you know that?  I'm like, well, O.B. and Anthony said she looks like a beast.  Yeah.  Watch it out, boy.  Yeah, a few people thought it was RuPaul.  He was just walking by the TV. 
[00:14:00]  No.  Yay.  I purposely turned it on.  I'm not going to say that it was on and I just happened to look.  Show research.  Because that's all bullshit.  Yeah, do show research.  Of course.  That's right.  Whatever.  Man.  You got to see Ralph Macchio, though.  The hair thing.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on with him.  Do we have any video of Ralph Macchio?  That was the only other thing I saw.  I almost saw Sugar Ray Leonard dance, too.  Almost.  Yeah?  Almost saw.  Couldn't take it?  Well, I was walking by.  Started getting an estrogen fucking rush.  They did a pre-interview with him. 
[00:14:30]  I saw that.  But I didn't see him actually fucking dance.  But I saw Ralph Macchio a little bit.  I saw the Wendy Williams.  And that was it, I think.  I didn't see Chris Jericho.  No?  How did Chris do it?  Did you see it?  The only real star, by the way.  The rest of them are kind of has-beens or almost stars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're either on their way up or they were up a long time ago.  Is that Ralph Macchio right there?  Yeah.  Is that him?  Yeah.  A little video?  All right.  Yeah.  You want to see Ralph Macchio?  Let's see.  You said there's like a Donald Trump thing going on with his hair? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, you'll see.  Is he doing a comb over?  Yeah, a little bit.  Why doesn't the Macchio get some follicles?  He's got to take that Karate Kid money.  Or it looks like it could be some kind of hair piece.  Something's going on.  Really?  Something's going on.  Ralph should come on the show.  I'll film him in on the follicles.  Let's see.  There he goes.  Yeah.  Old school.  I kissed her and she kissed me.  Like a fella once said, ain't that a kick in the head? 
[00:15:30]  A kick in the head.  That's funny.  He could send his comb over.  Get fucked up.  They're all themes, these songs.  I guess I think they theme these, depending on the celebrity.  Oh, of course.  A kick in the head is a karate thing, too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's true.  The Karate Kid.  He kicked, uh, what was his name?  Kicked the leg, Johnny.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Johnny kicked him in the head with the crane move.  But it's more the hair piece thing.  Yeah.  Why aren't they going close?  The feeling that you're a great stonking hit! 
[00:16:00]  See, look at this weird part comes from way over.  And that was just an amazing surprise.  You've got great potential.  It's a bit rough around the edge.  Oh, shut up.  A bit rough around the edges.  The radiators cracked at the core.  Did you see Wendy Williams' practice video?  I swear I didn't.  It was emotional.  I really was just taking a quick peek, just because it's a big show.  I sat down and turned on the program and watched it, and my girlfriend wasn't even home. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, did she leave you?  No, she's out of town.  Oh, because that would have made sense.  But, uh...  So you went out of your way to watch the whole show.  Yes.  See, that's way worse.  I've got to tweet you later.  Or, you think did you watch?  But that guy on the phone, he wasn't flipping around and stumbled upon it.  People lie.  He watched it like I did.  No, we're not...  Yeah, you can't use that with us, that you just happen to stumble across it.  No, it doesn't work.  Or your chick was watching.  And I just...  Yeah, because there's plenty...  Maybe if it was the 70s when we all had one fucking TV. 
[00:17:00]  But nowadays, even the poor people could...  Poor people.  Could afford three or four TVs in their house.  Yes.  You could go somewhere else and watch something.  Wendy was getting very emotional while she was...  She was practicing and she was crying a lot in her...  Leading up to the dancing video.  Because dancing's very hard for her.  Oh.  What?  She has a difficult time with it, so she cried.  And as she said, she doesn't see crying as a weakness.  It's just how she lets out your stress.  But she's a man.  Men are not supposed to cry.  That's true.  Enough of this crying on the TV. 
[00:17:30]  That's all I see now.  She started wiping her eyes with her wig.  It's a goofy show.  Did she?  Yeah.  It's a goofy show.  Why is she crying?  Chris Jericho didn't cry and he did well.  No.  I mean, the outfit, I mean, it's a little iffy.  I don't know.  Yeah, what's that about?  If you do well on a dance show, what's that really about?  Well, he's...  What's that really about?  Ralph Macchio did really well.  What's that really about?  I don't know in Ralph Macchio's case.  Is he married, Ralph Macchio?  That I don't know.  Married man? 
[00:18:00]  You ever see anything in the paper about who he's dating?  Didn't I?  No.  No, he's not in the gossip columns lately.  Just wondering.  Huh.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Maybe he watches Dancing with the Stars.  Do you think?  Well, he didn't want to come on this show and talk about his dating life.  No, I met him at a Jets game.  He knows exactly who we are.  And he also said, I'll never do your show.  What?  That was an exact quote from Ralph Macchio when we met.  He's got things.  Two Long Island guys, you know, talking about Smithtown and Huntington.  Yeah.  And he's like, yeah, I know about you guys. 
[00:18:30]  I'll never do your show.  People have such misconceptions about us, don't they?  Well, because he thinks we're going to pop right into hardcore personal shit.  When a lot of times we just hang with these people and have a good time.  I wonder what's going on in that personal life that he doesn't want to talk about.  What?  Ralph Macchio said he's coming in.  When?  Once he gets eliminated.  Macchio is?  He told me he would never do our show.  I know, man.  That's how great Roland is.  That's how Roland works. 
[00:19:00]  Once he gets eliminated.  Roland just fucking gets on the phone.  What if he wins?  Are we getting all the Dance with the Stars rejects this year?  Well, Chris Jericho and...  Well, he's just kind of a...  He's sort of a friend, even though he doesn't, like, pop any real info on our show.  He waits until the art interviews over and then tells everybody else.  I just picture three in the morning, a Ralph Macchio or the similar sort,  getting woken up from a call from Roland.  Hey, it's Roland.  You know, you really should do the European Anthony show. 
[00:19:30]  I have pictures.  We've been following you.  And if you don't get on the show, hey, you know, I have those pictures getting out.  Hey, oh, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce.  Do you blackmail them into coming on the show, Roland?  Is that what you do?  I don't know.  Because he said he'd never do the show, but then he really, he really, truly told me he would never do the show.  I know.  I changed his mind. 
[00:20:00]  Well, we'll have to wait and see on that one.  Yeah, I can't wait.  Even when I see it.  I can't wait.  We can't have Wendy Williams in here, though.  Oh, my God.  No.  She'll beat us up.  We've said some nasty things.  I don't care what she said.  How awkward would that be if we have to take heels to the fucking head from her?  Actually, you know, she'd probably be cool with it.  She knows the radio game.  Nah, she walked by the studio one day when she was doing Shade, and I could see.  Really?  Yeah.  I could see through people.  It's gotten back to her. 
[00:20:30]  Her husband-slash-manager was...  When she walked by, did you see your water rippling in the cups?  Everybody, no?  I was just wondering.  That's just because she's big, though.  Yeah, she is.  And very muscular.  Yes.  Too muscular.  Too fucking muscular.  All right.  So you watch Dancing with the Stars without your girl home?  Yeah.  That's pretty bad.  I wanted to see my boy, Chris Jericho.  And he did well?  Yeah, he did well.  I mean, yeah, I mean...  Did he talk about how good he was doing and shit like that?  Like he does...  Cutting promos? 
[00:21:00]  Was he cutting promos?  Yeah.  Was he working the mic?  He wasn't.  He was trying to be...  I think he's really trying to be the...  Ryan Seacrest guy.  Like, because, you know, he hosted that game show for a little while on ABC.  I think he's really trying to...  Oh.  Jericho.  I don't remember that.  Walls of Jericho?  Like, last season.  I don't remember that.  Was that his finishing move?  The Walls of Jericho.  The Walls of Jericho.  What was it?  It was like a Boston Crab where he just really stretched up the bag.  It used to be called the Lion Tamer, but then it became The Walls of Jericho. 
[00:21:30]  Everyone's finishing move just puts their name to it, but it's the same thing.  It's a suplex.  Yeah, Boston Crab.  It's a pile driver or something.  Modified.  Okay.  I'd wrestle like...  Or a Jera Salt.  Jera Salt.  It's like a moonsault.  I like that.  Sounds like a disinfectant.  Yeah.  So, Jess is gone and you're watching Dance with the Stars.  Yeah.  Sounds like a party at your place.  And Wednesday and Thursday, it'll be Idol Night.  Yeah.  American Idol's on.  Oh, I didn't think you meant the show.  I just meant you sitting there. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, Idol.  Doing nothing with your life.  Unless it's a personal thing or something.  Can I ask where she is?  She's in Brazil on a work trip.  Is she with Obama?  Holy shit.  No, but she went on the same day.  She left on Friday.  Is she Obama's squeeze?  That doesn't sound good.  That doesn't sound good at all.  Brazil, a work trip.  You know what goes on in Brazil?  For nine days.  You heard what Rogan said.  You know what Brazil is like?  What do they get...  I do.  They get bit by what again?  Or is it in cats?  AIDS. 
[00:22:30]  No, what was that thing he said?  That fucking thing that fucking makes everyone horny.  Yeah, I didn't like when he was talking about that.  And aggressive.  What was that again?  I don't remember exactly.  I forgot it.  Was it rats?  And then the cats eat the rats?  And then it's the cat poo or something?  And now it's in 80% of the Brazilians?  Damn.  I'm so off on my facts, but it makes everyone very...  It's something like that, though.  But Ant's right.  It makes everyone very horny down there.  Yeah.  You gotta watch that for nine days?  Yeah.  She's with a lot of work friends, so they're traveling groups.  Oh, boy.  Mainly girls.  Some guys. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, no.  Do you know what that's like?  It's Brazil.  You go to all another country, which culture is carnival, and there's guys involved?  How do you allow this?  Well, her boss is from Brazil.  Oh, my God.  And he flew her up.  He paid for it.  Because she's a pretty girl and everything.  She's beautiful.  It's a work trip.  It's business.  But you know this stuff like...  It doesn't matter.  You don't work 24 hours.  Who should you share in a hotel room with?  She's in an apartment. 
[00:23:30]  In an apartment?  Her boss has apartments.  Oh, my God.  Just everyone knocking on everyone's door at night after the workday's over.  Is there a group area to the apartment where everybody can kind of hang out?  There's several female co-workers with her in the apartment.  What about the men?  I don't know.  I don't know everybody who's in the apartment.  Did you talk to her and say, what are the sleeping arrangements?  No, I didn't want to be, you know...  I mean, sleeping arrangements.  I'm sure she has her own bed.  I would hope. 
[00:24:00]  How would you be sure of anything at this point?  I guess I didn't ask, but...  You ever watch fucking Real World and Jersey Shore and things like that?  I mean, you know I do.  Can you picture that green cam in the bedroom and somebody coming in?  Night vision?  Yeah.  This is how shit works.  With the blankets going up real high?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You know what that means, right?  Sexual intercourse.  Some pile driving.  Did she get a Brazilian before she went Brazilian?  I don't think so.  She would have had no reason to, since she'll have her pants on the whole time. 
[00:24:30]  When in Brazil, she'll have the Brazilians, though.  Yeah, no, I think she'll have her pants on the whole time.  Look, I know when you're in a relationship, you're supposed to be trusting, but...  But that's really pushing it.  But, I mean, maybe if she took a trip to Cleveland...  No, Brazil.  Especially right before, like, you know, you're engaged, so it's pre-marriage, so it's kind  of like, this might feel like her last...  Well, she left her engagement ring here, because she didn't want somebody in Brazil  to steal it.  Are you making that up for the radio?  No, I swear to God, it's in my apartment.  Because she knows that crime runs rampant in Brazil, so she didn't want to wear that 
[00:25:00]  with her.  Diamond on her finger.  So she left it home.  She left it at home.  Guaranteeing.  I asked her last night where it was.  Hold on.  Guaranteeing when she...  If she did bring the ring down there and took it off, she could lose it.  Yeah, exactly.  Guaranteeing that it won't be lost, and she'll be able to walk around Brazil without a ring  on.  This sounds...  She doesn't like...  She said she hates not having the ring on, but...  Oh, I bet.  She doesn't want to get her finger cut off by somebody trying to get that diamond.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  You ever see City of God?  What, the Sam Roberts?  I would gather.  Didn't you name the diamond?  Oh, yeah.  The Roberts maker, 6,000.  Everything needs a some thousand after it.  All right, so she's down there in Brazil with men and women and no wedding ring.  When does she check in?  What do you mean check in?  She hasn't checked in yet.  Checked in to where?  No, check in with you.  Check in with you.  Oh, yeah.  Phone calls, texts.  We were emailing back and forth, and yesterday we were on iChat webcamming. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, you were?  Yes.  Okay, now, with that...  That's to make you feel comfortable.  Were you able to look around a little bit?  No, I mean, it's such a limited scope.  She didn't move.  Why didn't she spin it around?  She didn't.  I don't know.  There could be a bunch of Brazilian fucking guys on the other side of that fucking laptop.  Naked.  Naked, just unclipped hogs.  She spins it around, and there's just one Nike 13.  Oh, oh.  In the corner.  It's like, why is it Anteater in your apartment?  It looks like Snuffleupagus. 
[00:26:30]  I didn't hear any male voices.  No?  No.  Was she doing this at all, like, beforehand?  But she was wearing the headphones with the mic, so it wouldn't have picked everything.  Oh, my God.  Do not.  Jordan and Scranton has written ha-ha so many times on the screen right now.  She left the engagement ring home, and then, ah, as far as the eye could see.  It's a very nice ring.  Steven Singer hooked me up.  Yes, of course.  And she doesn't want it to get stolen.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, we have insurance on it, but still, somebody could cut her finger off to get the ring. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What about their security and safety down there?  What?  Do you feel a little bit...  Do you know there are a lot of kidnappings that go on?  That's true.  Because, you know, people from the United States are worth the cash.  And she's a pretty girl, so it could be one of those fucking situations like that fucking...  That girl there in Aruba.  Luckily, she's not blonde, and she's somewhat olive-skinned, so when she travels, she sometimes  does get confused for not being American.  She blends in?  And she speaks some Portuguese. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my God.  So she can fit in with the culture a little bit.  So she can speak well enough to make a hookup.  She emailed me this morning and said they went to dinner, and she ordered in Portuguese.  And they thought she was a native.  And they thought she was adorable is what they thought.  Oh, she's very good-looking, yeah.  Let me say hi to Howard in Mississippi.  Howard.  Yeah, I just want to know how stupid it's saying.  Not stupid at all.  Well, this is coming from this guy that has that Mississippi wall. 
[00:28:00]  Even a Mississippi man ain't that damn stupid.  That's naive.  I'm very secure.  No, that's realistic.  If my wife would go somewhere and take any of her wedding ring off, her engagement ring,  you only take it off for one reason, open season.  No, it's not open season.  It's so it doesn't get stolen, or her finger doesn't get cut off, or she doesn't get kidnapped.  I can't wait.  Sam, you will never get past the youth part again. 
[00:28:30]  I love Howard.  Thank you, Howard.  I think she's going to come back from her Brazil trip, look at Sam, and go, I don't need a bachelorette party anymore.  I just had one.  Then I would start getting suspicious.  How many days?  Nine.  Nine days in Brazil.  A lot of days.  She'll be like, you know that ring I left there?  Just take it back to Steven Singer.  Oh, that one stinks.  Maybe you can get yourself a nicer TV.  I have no use for that anymore.  I'm not coming back from Brazil. 
[00:29:00]  I'm very secure.  She's with a lot of females.  They're just having a fun time.  They went up to the same statue that Obama was at, the big Christ statue on the mountain.  They went there yesterday.  They had a great time.  Isn't that one of the wonders of the world?  I think it is a wonder.  She said it was wonderful.  A big Jesus with his arms stretched out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's some of those other wonders?  They wonder pretty good.  Machu Picchu.  The pyramids.  What?  The Great Barrier Reefs.  The pyramids. 
[00:29:30]  But how does she know that while she's gone, I'm not, you know, getting around?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  From what I hear, you're having a genuine pisser alone in your house watching Dancing  with the Stars.  That's true.  What did you do last night?  You watched Dancing with the Stars by yourself, which is very suspect.  Well, the cat was there.  Did Ralph Machu stop by after he danced?  Why would he do that?  I don't know.  What would we have to talk about?  I don't know.  So, what was your life like last night without Jess, with Jess ordering fucking Brazilian 
[00:30:00]  food in their native tongue to waiters that are probably drooling over her?  What were you doing?  Well, I got home and I made some chicken.  What kind of chicken?  Just a chicken breast.  You put it, you grill it up.  Uh-huh.  It's okay.  That's, you know, regular food.  But then I realized that I don't really have any other food in the house.  Nothing for a side?  I looked for some kind of vegetable or bread or even some lettuce.  She left you with nothing in the house. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I didn't realize.  I should have checked.  Yeah, maybe.  But so I had popcorn.  Chicken and popcorn?  That's all I had in the house.  That's what you had?  That's all I had.  She's having some great Brazilian food that she ordered and guaranteed the wine was flowing  and stuff.  I mean, they probably, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I swear to you, my 10-month-old son eats better than Sam already.  I mean, he's already eating more shit than you do.  I'm going to try to get some vegetables today because now I know they're not there. 
[00:31:00]  But usually Jess has some carrots and some bread and all this stuff ready to go.  And you, do you want to know about Brazil or what?  We got people checking.  Yeah, I mean, I'd love to be more cultured.  All right, hold on a minute.  We'll start with Marcos in Yonkers.  Marcos.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, Sam, look, I know you have a lot of haters, bro, but I'm not one of them.  But I just want you to know Brazil is the orgy capital of the world.  Of course it is.  I can't believe you let your girl go over there, bro. 
[00:31:30]  I appreciate that, bro.  I appreciate that, bro.  Como, Jess.  Como.  Como.  She's not one of the Brazilian girls.  No, no.  Como?  No.  Como.  Como.  She's just there to see the sights.  Como, Jess.  To work.  She's very busy working.  Yeah.  It's a work trip.  You know when you go to Hawaii and they give you one of those leis as a greeting?  Yeah, sure.  Oh, boy.  In Brazil, it's like blowjobs and stuff.  Yeah.  That's how your visit starts.  Yep.  I'll have to ask her about some of this, but I don't think she's giving a... 
[00:32:00]  Well, what would the equivalent be to the woman there?  That's what she's getting.  Oh, I hope not.  Oh, yeah.  That's a greeting down there.  She's not...  Other people aren't supposed to be doing that.  Huh?  Other people are not supposed to be doing that.  Well, not supposed to.  All right, let's say hi to Ron in Boston.  This can't be good.  It's coming from Boston.  Hey, Ron.  It might be supportive.  What's up, Ron?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, did your Celtics beat the shit out of my Knicks last night?  I don't know.  I don't watch the...  God, I can't find one guy in Boston that watches the Celtics. 
[00:32:30]  Why?  Because they're too black, right?  Yeah.  If I want to get carjacked, I'll go watch the Celtics.  You don't fucking watch the Celtics up there for some reason.  Boston's great.  Yeah.  Fucking the Knicks lost, I think, to the Celtics last night.  And, yeah, we're not doing well with Carmelo Anthony, Anthony.  He was supposed to be the big get for the Knicks.  I thought he was doing well when he first signed on.  No, I started to hint that maybe we'll gel next year, that maybe he got me a little too  late in the season.  All right, whatever.  What's up, Ron?  Yeah, I just wanted to tell Sam that Jeff left her wedding ring home because she's getting 
[00:33:00]  thick.  Oh.  That's very, first of all, it's a vulgar way of saying it.  That is.  And second of all, sorry.  Oh, guys, make out with Bob Kelly, so she's out getting some real men.  Is there like three or four hours where you just can't get a hold of her at a time?  Well, we just email pretty much because, I mean, she doesn't have cell phone service.  She's out of the country.  Oh, she doesn't have cell phone service.  It's expensive to make those international calls. 
[00:33:30]  How does she not have cell service?  Because it's international.  It's international.  Yeah, it's very expensive.  Cells work.  I mean, they work, but you've got to pay a whole bunch of money for international calling.  Nate in D.C.  Nate, a satellite phone.  We don't have a satellite phone.  You should get one.  You really should.  Nate.  Hey, what's up?  Real quick, the only Portuguese she's speaking is iPop B while Sam's throwing out freaking  hot dogs in the sink like no house is dead. 
[00:34:00]  I don't think.  First of all, I don't even need hot dogs.  Hi, puppy.  Right now, Jess has a red and green paddle over her ass and she's just flipping back and  forth.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, no.  I mean, that's obviously not true.  This guy is feeling for you.  Joe in Texas.  Joe.  Thank God.  Sam, literally, I'm not even playing.  My stomach hurts for you.  That's all I got to say.  Well, thank you for the support.  She went on a business trip with her boss.  That's so bad.  Well, not just her and her boss.  Have you watched fucking rom-coms, by the way? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Have you ever seen the one where the girl, she goes on a business trip and it's out of  the country.  It's far away.  It's with a bunch of people.  And she leaves the dicky boyfriend at home.  I'm not dicky, though.  I'm just describing a sitcom.  Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  Sorry.  And she leaves the dicky, asshole, useless boyfriend at home.  And is just like annoyed to be going on this business trip.  It's like, oh, God.  And then she realizes the fun that she's having and the life that's opened up when she's not 
[00:35:00]  with this fucking piece of shit, boring asshole at home.  You're just talking about the movie still?  Yeah, there's still the rom-com.  And then she hooks up with somebody and then there's a little tension and she's got to  tell the complete loser at home.  In the movie.  In the movie.  That she doesn't want to see him anymore.  And then the couple, the one she met away, they get along fine.  Well, I mean, it sounds like an interesting plot for a movie, but I'm the catch. 
[00:35:30]  What movie?  Oh, the movie.  Oh, right.  I was talking about a rom-com.  Is her boss married?  Yes.  With children.  But it's not just her and her boss.  No, no.  There's other guys.  Did the boss bring the wife?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  The whole family's there.  You sure?  I'm positive.  So why didn't you go?  Because I have to go to work.  I can't take vacation days around here.  That's convenient.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I got to work.  What about other guys that are there?  Has she named the guys?  No, I don't know any names. 
[00:36:00]  How many?  I have no idea.  What's the ratio?  There's a lot of people from the company that are going.  Yeah, let me tell you something, though.  How many girls from the company are as pretty as Jess?  I would imagine not many.  I mean...  I would imagine not many either.  I think that's a fair assessment.  Yeah.  So now the guys that went are all going to be fixated on Jess.  And they have a rapport already, because it's been around the office.  Yeah, but I have a rapport.  They chat.  You're old news.  You're not exciting anymore and fun. 
[00:36:30]  You're kind of...  You're there.  And now she's in a whole other context with these people that she's friendly with already.  There's no need to break any ice.  This is fucking...  They're drinking.  Yeah, and they're social.  Out on the town in Brazil, a very erotic country.  This is craziness.  I mean, I will have to...  I mean, I'll have to send a couple emails just to see what's up, but...  You better.  Is she sending pictures?  She's going to just be swept away in the energy down there. 
[00:37:00]  Yes, exactly.  The energy.  That's what happens.  She has no iPhoto on her computer that she has with her, so she said she couldn't send  pictures.  I have never heard of so many excuses for cutting off communication with a fiancé.  It's on her work computer.  Why would her work computer have iPhoto?  Let me say hi to Paulo in Jersey.  He knows a little bit about Brazil.  Oh, boy.  He's a Brazilian guy, matter of fact.  Oh, great.  Great, great, great.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I go down there every other year.  I have family down there. 
[00:37:30]  And as soon as they get a hold that she's American, because they love Americans, dude,  a lot of those guys that have game, man, they're all in shape, they do that martial  arts, she's going to get laid.  Oh, boy.  Well, she doesn't look that American, though.  They're going to put her...  She looks American.  They will find out, man.  They will find out.  You're crazy.  She looks American.  People are suggesting also that giant Jesus statue.  Yeah.  It's Jesus saying, down here, our dicks are this big.  Oh, no.  I hope so.  That's so big. 
[00:38:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  So, I don't know.  I mean, that's big.  That right there is a little iffy.  Fuck, that's funny.  I've never heard that one before.  He's got his arms all the way out.  Very wide.  Oh, yeah.  That is a big one.  Big one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're lucky, maybe they'll just use their tip.  I don't think they'll use anything.  Just the tip.  Just the tip.  Emmett in Bayside.  That's really funny.  That's huge.  Emmett, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yellow.  I'm a long-time listener. 
[00:38:30]  I just wanted to remind Sam about the Brazilian wandering spider.  Oh, the wandering spider.  That's what Rogan was talking about, right?  Yes.  Exactly.  Makes them all horny.  Tell him to call his girl right away.  Don't go near any cats.  Yeah, the cats.  Well, I mean, she's not going to go near stray animals.  All right.  Well, you know what?  She's acting funny when she gets home.  You'll know what happens.  Whatever.  I bet she'll be acting just the same.  I would study her gait when she gets off the plane.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  If she's walking like John Wayne when he gets off the horses, you know, he does that, like,  off, you know, that walk.  Yeah.  That's bad.  Yeah, study her gait.  She told me that she got me a souvenir yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, there's some guilt already.  No, it's just she's getting something for her friend.  Is it a surprise?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  Chlamydia.  I hope not.  Chlamydia.  No, and she's meeting her best friend there, who is a girl, who moved to Brazil for work. 
[00:39:30]  Uh-huh.  And they're just hanging out.  So her best friend, this girl?  Yeah.  Does she have a boyfriend?  Yes, she does.  All right.  And they're just going to be, it's just going to be...  Wait, the boyfriend down there?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, so you don't think the boyfriend's going to have a few friends?  Right, I was just getting there, yeah.  What, are you crazy?  You think they're just going to go out and it'll be like her friend and the boyfriend  and Jess, the third wheel, to just chit-chat?  You don't think the guy's going to be like, let me grab my friend fucking, you know...  It'll be large groups of people, I think.  My friend Juan. 
[00:40:00]  No, there'll be no Wans.  I think Juan's going to dinner with them one night.  I hope not.  And it'll be like, your Portuguese is quite fascinating.  I'm quite taken with you, Jess.  And she'll be like, oh my God, nobody's ever paid this much attention to me.  Yes, I love dark skin, but like bright blue eyes.  Oh, that's a terrible combination.  And just be like, oh, Jess, who is this man you have at home?  Oh, this is a very good question right here.  Give me a boy.  Paul, go ahead, Paul. 
[00:40:30]  Hey there, Paul.  We're talking about Brazil here.  How the hell are nine people sleeping in an apartment in Brazil with the boss and his wife?  This must be...  What is it, real world apartment size?  I know.  The boss doesn't...  He's a boss.  He doesn't have one apartment.  He has several places of residencies.  Oh, he owns a whole...  He owns the whole building.  No, he owns different residencies.  So they're strewn all around Brazil.  Well, around the city, whatever city they're in, yeah.  Where are they?  I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  Sao Paulo?  I would assume so.  How do you not know what city your girlfriend's in in Brazil?  You know how big Brazil is?  It's a giant place.  What did she get?  Rio.  Oh, Rio.  Oh, fuck.  The worst possible city you could have mentioned is Rio.  That's the place.  That's where the animals are.  That's the place.  That's the place where it all goes down.  That's the Vegas of fucking Brazil.  I thought it was just like the capital.  It's like the touristy area.  Rio is where Carnival is. 
[00:41:30]  Rio laughs at Vegas.  You ever watch Blame It on Rio?  No.  Yeah.  Give it a look.  Give it a look.  See what happens.  I shouldn't have been watching Dancing with the Stars.  See what happens when you go to Rio.  How hot was that girl in Blame It on Rio?  Or am I dating myself now?  I gotta see what she looks like.  There was Demi.  Demi was in it.  No, no, not her.  And then the other one.  Demi had her little titties at the time.  And she would cover them up with her hair on the beach.  Because they went topless.  Because by the way, the beaches down there are topless.  What's the temperature in Rio?  Let me punch up. 
[00:42:00]  Let me just punch this up.  You can do that?  You can get the temperature just like that?  She's not going to go to the beach with her bathing suit on.  She's not going to go topless.  Of course she will.  It's absolutely perfect.  Oh my god.  Let's see.  In Rio it's 73 degrees.  Is that right now?  Mostly clouds.  What's it going up to?  Today we're looking at 82 degrees.  Yeah, but there is a chance of rain.  No, that's Jess's tears.  Yeah, that's a chance for everyone to go inside somewhere.  Oh, 82 degrees in Rio. 
[00:42:30]  You know what those beaches are like?  Probably nice.  I don't know.  Holy shit.  Danny, why don't you pop up maybe a Google image of a beach.  Rio beach.  Yeah, let's see a beach of Rio and see what it looks like.  Danny doesn't have to search hard.  This is going to be a quick search just to show you what's going on down there.  Okay.  Oh boy.  Oh my god.  That is paradise.  Look at the thongs.  The multitude of thongs.  Well, she didn't bring any bathing suits like that. 
[00:43:00]  It doesn't matter.  You don't think they sell that shit right there at the resort she's staying at?  Oh, there it is.  Just women.  Women sitting in beach chairs with their tits just out because it's topless.  She's there with her co-workers.  She's not going to go naked on the beach.  How do you know?  82 degrees?  82 degrees is not weather to get new with your co-workers.  Get caught up in the whole...  Look at that.  Oh, Jesus.  There's girls with pom-poms on the beach in little bikinis.  They look gorgeous.  Oh my god.  Their asses are slamming.  This is what the locals do, not the tourists. 
[00:43:30]  No, this is what everyone does.  Mm-hmm.  Brazil beach.  Not with their co-workers.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  They don't look like...  The second picture in doesn't look like locals.  Yeah.  They look pretty white.  They are a little lighter skin.  Oh my god.  She doesn't have any bathing suits like that.  Well, she'll go naked.  She's not going to go naked.  Then she'll just go naked.  They do that there.  They're allowed.  She'll just go naked.  I understand they're allowed, but she'll be too bashful.  Well, you know, caught up in the moment.  A little bit of booze, right?  There's going to be a... 
[00:44:00]  There's drinking involved.  You think there's going to be a...  Ah, what the hell.  Yeah.  This is a work-cation, they call it.  Ah, what the hell.  I don't think so.  A work-cation.  I don't think so.  You know, yeah, she'll be thinking...  And Juan is going to be like, Jess, why don't we go in the water a little bit?  She goes, well, I don't have my bathing suit, my bikini, or anything.  And he'll go, Jess, there is no need to be bashful.  We remove our clothes.  That's Juan?  That's Juan right there.  He's punched up a picture of a guy, like, showering with ripped abs, and he's totally 
[00:44:30]  nude.  That's what you're going to have to deal with.  And he'll be like, just take off...  We do not pay attention to the confines of clothing here in Rio.  And then, here, have another shot.  And she'll just take another shot, and before you know it, she'll go, you know what?  What the hell?  I'm only here once.  And then the clothes are off.  He's got her in the water, like, holding her waist, and she's got...  Her hands on his big, muscular shoulders.  Is he also nude? 
[00:45:00]  He's nude.  Ah, shit.  Nude.  You gotta say it like that, right?  He's nude.  Yeah, because that's going nowhere good.  I'm getting a hard on.  Are you?  With this story?  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut, Anthony?  Yeah.  I did not know this, but Rio de Janeiro translates to River of Jism.  Oh, thank God.  I didn't know that.  De Janeiro is Portean.  I had no idea.  Because it's like DeGenaes.  Right.  Rio de Janeiro.  You're making E-Rock hungry.  You're nuts, man. 
[00:45:30]  Hey, by the way, Michelle Johnson was in Blame It on Rio, and I'm also getting word that  she did not age well.  Really?  And Michelle Johnson, I think she had the heavies in Blame It on Rio.  Is that her right there?  Look at her bush.  Oh, my God.  Look at her bush.  She got some nice titties, though.  Yeah, she showed them off in Blame It on Rio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or at least she saw more than what Demi Moore was doing.  Is that going to...  I don't think so.  She's going to be...  She's not on vacation.  She's not by herself.  She's with co-workers. 
[00:46:00]  She wants to make a good impression.  Yes, it's Juan.  I'm at my apartment.  I know you're at yours with the workers, but why don't you just come over for a little  bit?  Play some music.  I have a cooker's dinner.  Real dinner, not chicken fingers and popcorn.  Your fiancé.  There's nothing else in the house, Juan.  Real dinner, and I have some wonderful wine that we can sit back and listen to music.  And you can tell me all about your life, and I would listen intently, looking directly 
[00:46:30]  into your eyes and listen to you.  You probably don't have a man that listens to you, do you?  I listen enough.  What?  I didn't hear you.  I'm not even paying attention to your fiancé.  Oh, you have to go on camera with him?  Okay, I'll stand back here and just pose for you.  Is that what's going on?  Yes.  Well, I think she was looking at the cam.  Let me nod over behind it.  This guy's going to give you a little knowledge.  His name's Dave in Jersey, and I believe Dave's wife also liked to travel with her boss. 
[00:47:00]  That sounds good.  Dave.  Happens.  Hey, Phil.  How are you doing?  This will give you some peace of mind, I bet.  Thank God, Dave.  Yeah, this will be some peace of mind for Sam.  What's up, Dave?  Yeah, my wife used to travel all the time with her boss and coworkers.  Cool.  And, you know, 8 o'clock at night, wouldn't be able to get in touch with her anymore.  She'd start texting and emailing.  Oh, boy.  And, you know, she wouldn't get back to me that night.  You know, after a few months, I started getting suspicious. 
[00:47:30]  My wife, now ex-wife, started to find a lingerie in the bag.  And, uh...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, she was hitting the boss.  Oh, jeez.  Well, the boss is there with his family, his wife, and children.  Yeah, but all of a sudden, like, Jess has to, like, have a little meeting about work shit.  I've met her boss.  He's a very reserved, nice man.  And then Jess knocks on the door, and he's in there in just a ball bag.  Oh, my God.  And, by the way, and her friend knows that Jess is in a happy relationship, so I don't think she would take part in introducing Jess to Juan. 
[00:48:00]  She's in a relationship.  And let me tell you something.  She's happy.  Oh.  Let me tell you something.  A very smart man once told me they're all sisters.  Oh, boy.  They're all sisters.  Oh, shit.  She wouldn't introduce Jess to Juan.  They're all sisters.  I don't know how Juan would even come about.  David of Boston.  David.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Come about everywhere.  So she left the Roberts Maker 6000 at home, correct? 
[00:48:30]  Yes, correct.  How about the balloon knot 6000?  Did she bring that with her?  Well, that said, I mean, I don't know.  That's referring to a part of her body.  You can't remove that.  That's a dumb question, for starters.  And didn't David Letterman also bring his family on a trip at the same time with his fiancée or his girlfriend?  I don't know what David Letterman does.  You could ask David Letterman that question.  Are you going to be asking a lot of questions when she gets back?  I mean, after this conversation, there'll be more questions than there was.  Okay, that's good.  I definitely have to start getting her on webcam a little more frequently. 
[00:49:00]  How long is she there for?  Nine days.  Nine days total.  Nine days.  Let's look at the temperatures.  82, 82, 81, 86, 84.  All right.  Wow.  That's just a few days in advance.  Just looking.  The weekend's looking great, by the way.  Well, she's back on Sunday.  Yeah.  Well, Friday's 86, Saturday's 84, whatever.  Why is she there for the weekend?  They work in the weekend?  Yeah.  Why not come back on Friday?  What's going on in the weekend?  Really?  Why not just come back after work Friday? 
[00:49:30]  They flew down Friday night after work.  So two weekends down in Brazil.  Right.  So she's been there since Friday night.  What the fuck is that about?  But they figure Friday night they got right to work.  Yeah.  I mean, they got a lot of stuff going on.  Let me say hi to John and Josie.  John.  Hey, Chad.  This reminds me of a line out of True Romance.  They did so much fuck and they changed the bloodlines forever.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  She's getting fucking slammed.  Well, right now she's not.  It's early in the morning, first of all. 
[00:50:00]  She's getting her fucking balloon up, pound it.  I mean, there's no, I don't think that's happening.  Hey, there's somebody, yeah, I kind of like this theory.  Did your mom send Jess to Brazil?  Of course not.  We all know the hate your mom has for Jess.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  This was a way of getting Jess out of little Sammy's life.  As a matter of fact, Jess has been corresponding with the family and on that family email is my mom.  Yeah.  Guilt.  And she's on a work trip.  How could my mom send her on a work trip?  My mom is very fond of Jess.  Your mom is sending Juan in. 
[00:50:30]  I bet your mom sends Juan in there.  If I find out that's true, I'm going to be super pissed at her.  Hello.  But she's not going to do you laundry, so you're going to just take it.  He's going to sweep her right away.  No.  Right.  Remember that guy?  That's Juan again.  There's Juan.  There's Juan.  First of all, there's Juan.  That is the perfect picture you could have found, Derry.  It is so...  Who took a picture of Juan when he was getting out of the shower?  He's still showering.  That curtain's open.  Dude, that curtain's open for like, why don't we both shower off? 
[00:51:00]  And for Rio, that's out of shape, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  That guy is like the laughing stock of Rio.  Oh, man.  He's in way better shape than me.  Let me say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Jeff gives up the balloon knock to the first guy who doesn't know what WrestleMania is.  Oh, God.  They won't be speaking wrestling.  Well, let me tell you why that's dumb.  WrestleMania is a worldwide phenomenon.  Everybody knows what WrestleMania is.  What does he like?  What does he like to do with you?  Romance, things like that. 
[00:51:30]  And then Jess will be like, oh, he watches wrestling.  I took it to the Royal Rumble.  And he'll be like, oh, so he is an athlete, a wrestler, much like we are down here in Brazil.  Like, you know, no, no.  Professional wrestling.  You know, Vince McMahon, the WWE.  And he'd be like, oh, I am so sorry.  Why would he say that?  It's very entertaining.  And she'll just say, thank you.  No.  Because he feels her pain.  And you know what a thank you is in Rio, right?  Yes.  Just remember what a hello is.  Oh, boy. 
[00:52:00]  I don't think it's based on much.  Let me say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Colorado.  Good morning, boys.  I got two things.  First off, Sam, an international calling package for your cell phone is only $39.99 for either Verizon or AT&T.  $40 is a lot of money in these times.  Economy is tough.  Yeah, sure it is.  And secondly, my wife works with three Brazilian men who are in their early 20s.  And when they first started, all I heard for two weeks was how hot they were. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, God.  Well, obviously, your wife is not happy in her marriage.  Oh, no.  How do you like them apples?  Yeah.  I don't think those apples are very tasty.  That's right.  Unhappy wife is not my problem.  Yeah, but she heard this from her co-workers who are all young women also who are married.  Many of them are married women, too.  Many of them are also unhappy because there aren't a lot of guys who are as great as me.  Kevin's saying Sam has seven radio gigs and he can't afford a... 
[00:53:00]  Listen, international...  The funny thing about radio gigs, they're not as lucrative as one would have thought.  You would imagine, right?  It's a crazy thing, but radio gigs, a lot of them...  Yeah, well...  Matt in Indiana.  Matt.  Matt.  Nothing?  Well, I think anybody's...  Yeah, I think he's got it.  He only gets paid for half of a show.  I get paid for basically half a gig.  All right, well, I mean, the phones are just lit.  People trying to just make you feel better. 
[00:53:30]  They've done a really shit job of it, I'll tell you that much.  Now, they're just trying to help, Sam.  Don't start letting your anger out on the callers because you're mad that your fiancé is in Brazil with Juan.  Well, I have a happy relationship with my fiancé, and just because these callers leave their wives and significant others dissatisfied, don't take it out on me.  Do you guys want a really bad phone call?  I've been trying to keep it slightly...  Well, I break the streak now.  No.  What do you mean slightly?  You've been talking about balloon knots.  Yeah, that's true.  There's nothing respectable.  I've been keeping it respectable.  You just said... 
[00:54:00]  I've been keeping it respectable, Sam.  What do they do?  Do you want a bad one or not?  No, is what I'll say, I guess.  I mean, for the radio show, would you like a bad one?  Yeah, we'll do a bad one.  Okay, we'll do one.  All right.  For the show.  For the show.  For the bit.  John in Philly, go ahead.  Sam.  Yeah, John.  Nine days, plenty of time.  Don't worry about it.  Okay.  Nine days is plenty of time.  She's going to have a nice abortion.  She'll have everything all...  Oh, my honor.  Of all the distasteful things that somebody could say.  That's bad. 
[00:54:30]  That's bad.  I mean, there's so many elements of that that wouldn't happen.  I mean, just the first the act and then no protection.  It's just, it's a horrible thing to say.  It's not true.  Oh, this is a very good question coming in from Gary in New York.  We got food in front of us.  We got to take a break.  But Gary, go ahead.  What happens when Juan asks her into the office to take some dictation?  Oh, not the oral dictation.  She doesn't take dictation.  And second of all, Juan is not her boss. 
[00:55:00]  It's her...  Well, she is a skirt.  She's a secretary, right?  Yeah.  She's not a secretary.  She's not a secretary?  Oh, no.  And she doesn't take dictation.  No?  No.  Executive assistant, all right?  What happens when the poor boy asks you to take dictation?  Assistant to the assistant manager.  I won't get into too many details because her profession will be revealed that way.  Well, we don't want that happening.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the best of luck to you two after she gets back.  Juan is not her boss.  He's her girlfriend's boyfriend's fictional friend. 
[00:55:30]  Fictional friend.  When the four of them just go out.  Through drinks, you know.  And he shows her the town.  Oh, my God.  He's not going to show her the town.  And that's not her.  Neither one of them.  That's Michelle Johnson from Blame It on Rio.  Yeah, but Michelle Johnson can do what Michelle Johnson does.  That has nothing to do with...  Demi looks pretty good there.  Yeah, but she looks good.  You could tell she was becoming a star because she really covered up her boobs with her hair  in front of her face.  The other one you could tell was desperate.  She pulled her hair all the way back so you could see those big and heavies.  But those girls aren't there with their co-workers trying to make a good impression. 
[00:56:00]  That's how you walk around down there.  You know what kind of Bush is in Demi's bikini, by the way?  We have all seen that shot.  Damn.  Some say that...  There was a lot of tit in Blame It on Rio.  Yeah, absolutely.  Some say that picture's fake of Demi.  No, can't be.  Well, first of all, it's fictional, that film, by the way.  It's not a documentary.  Well...  That's pretty accurate.  It's just something that is...  It really is.  It's meant to tantalize American men into thinking in a certain way.  Tantalize.  I miss movies that used to just show breasts for no reason. 
[00:56:30]  I know.  They really have taken that out of the movies for some reason.  Well, they didn't take it out of real life.  What do you mean?  Down in Rio.  People do their shit.  I don't think...  I mean...  Camo.  Camo.  That's for...  Oh, you want to talk to Renardo.  Renardo.  Yeah, I'll talk to Renardo.  Renardo.  Renardo.  Renardo.  What's up?  Yes.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Buenos dias. 
[00:57:00]  I just want to tell Sam how beautiful Jess was last night.  She's sleeping right now, and I don't want to wake her, but you have the most wonderful  girl.  You must take better care of her.  Oh, that's nice.  You don't know Renardo.  That's nice.  She's taking care of her.  Don't be mean.  Renardo doesn't know, and he doesn't have an international sell plan either.  He couldn't be making this call.  This does bring up one of our classic stories that I swear, I just got to tell again, with  the help of Anthony, of course. 
[00:57:30]  The Turks and Caicos trip.  I'm not saying you're...  Oh, God.  Sam, I will step out of character for a second and say, I'm not saying your girl is this  girl.  Right.  But we do remember a time when we all flew down on a charter to Turks and Caicos, and  we saw this girl say goodbye to her boyfriend, and then she's on the flight, and then we're  at Club Med in Turks and Caicos, okay?  And now we're on a booze...  What was it called?  A booze...  Booze cruise.  It was a booze cruise with a boat.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Okay.  That's what a booze cruise is.  It's kind of hard.  Yeah.  Booze cruise without a boat.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's called a booze swim. 
[00:58:00]  So, all of a sudden, we see this girl, and I remember the mental image of this girl  saying goodbye to her boyfriend at JFK.  I swear this is as true as it gets.  Yeah, this gets so bad.  And we'll back me up on it.  So, now we're on the booze cruise, where we go to a beach and play all these fucked up  games, cake stands.  Just drinking.  Drinking.  Yeah.  It was an obstacle course, but you had a drink on the way there and back.  Everyone got so fucked up.  Okay.  We get back on the booze cruise.  The girl is on the booze cruise with us. 
[00:58:30]  We're with our girls at the time.  Okay?  The captain, I swear this is the God's honest truth, all sorts, starts making time with  this girl.  Yeah.  And just has his arm around her.  Yeah.  A little flirting.  This is the short version of the story.  Just talking.  Halfway back to Club Med, she's blowing the guy in front of all of us, but in a way where  you can't really see, but you know what's going on.  You know why?  Because the way the captain's wheel was set up, it had like a podium thing in front of  it, and he was standing at this captain's wheel. 
[00:59:00]  She was underneath the podium thing, blowing the captain of the ship as he's fucking navigating  through a storm to get us back to the fucking resort.  But the best part, we see the storm clouds.  They are getting really dark.  Yes.  He slowed the fucking boat down.  Yeah, he didn't want to get back fast, so he slowed the boat way down to finish his  blowjob while we're ready to get fucking swamped by this Caribbean storm.  Right, with the lightning and all, because the booze cruise just went down the beach.  It wasn't a far... 
[00:59:30]  But he needed a little more time.  It wasn't that far, the boat ride.  Yeah, so he slowed down, and me and Ant, I swear, I remember looking at him, and we're  looking at the fucking clouds like, hurry up and come, you asshole.  I don't want to get hit by lightning.  And then the tag on the story is, once we all went home, we saw her again get off the  plane and run into the arms of her boyfriend.  Run lovingly into the arms of her boyfriend like, sweetheart, oh, I miss you.  And he's like, baby.  And they were just so in love with Captain fucking...  Blowjob.  Blowjob. 
[01:00:00]  With Captain Blowjob on her mouth.  That is a true story.  It certainly is.  I believe the story, but Jess is not going on any booze cruises, and she doesn't drink  to excess.  But I took your girl out of it.  It just reminded me of my story.  Right.  She's there for work purposes.  I'm like, what a fucking whore.  We have a big event happening, so a lot has to get done.  I think she made believe her sunglasses fell.  Oh, I gotta find my sunglasses.  Oh, my God.  Next thing you know, the boat is barely moving. 
[01:00:30]  We saw her fucking hands on each side of his thighs.  What a nightmare.  Like, oh, it was just, oh, my God, she's blowing the captain.  Then she came up wearing his captain's head.  It was so stereotypical.  All right.  Well, we should take a break.  Yeah, let's eat.  One of my favorite stories of all time.  Juan gotta eat.  It's like, holy shit.  That is a nightmare.  Holy shit.  It's bad.  And there is no Juan, by the way.  Our Turks and Caicos stories are some of the best stories ever.  Oh, yeah.  That could be easily a chapter in a book. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, I remember when my ex-wife, wife at the time, ex-wife, future ex-wife, decided  she wanted to go parachuting.  She wanted to go skydiving.  Tandem skydiving.  And I just saw her launch herself out of a plane, saw this little dot.  And I was just like, oh, God, please don't open.  Don't fucking open.  I was looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.  I see the canopy open.  And I'm just like, fuck.  I went right, before she even hit the beach, I went right back to the bar.  Yeah.  Just disappointed. 
[01:01:30]  But you would have sacrificed the other guy.  Fuck the other guy.  Who cares?  But, you know, but it's all about these girls.  It's all about getting close to the guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You come down from.  He's in a virtual butt fuck with her.  Right.  You know, a tandem parachuting.  You obviously didn't care, but I'm sure there's a bunch of guys that do care that their  wives or girlfriends are doing that exact fucking tandem jump.  Here's the way we hold on.  And he grabs a tits, just fucking, you know, wraps his leg around.  And I keep my penis out for another thing for you to grab on to. 
[01:02:00]  She's going to say no to the tit grab.  She's what?  A couple thousand feet in the air, scared shitless.  Of course she's going to go for the tit, allow the tit grab.  Jess is not parachuting in Brazil.  I should have went to the chute packing class that they had that day.  And then my girl, my girl at the time, decided she needed to hang out with the trapeze guy.  The trapeze dude.  What do you mean hang out?  And we're all hanging out at Club Med and I'm like, I'm drunk and tired.  I'm trying to hang in there as long as I can. 
[01:02:30]  She's got all the energy in the world because she's got trapeze guy that's showing interest.  A French trapeze guy that's showing interest.  And then we try to do the trapeze.  So it's like we just look like we're struggling to just stay on the thing.  Yeah.  And the chicks are watching us look like assholes.  And then French guy gets up there.  He's one hand.  He's doing dances and stuff.  He's doing fucking tumbles on the trapeze, grabbing the other trapeze.  It's how they work it.  It's their gig.  It's how they work it. 
[01:03:00]  They get the guys to try the trapeze because then they look like complete idiots.  Or we look like complete idiots because that's what happened to us.  They're the alpha males.  I had a beer belly at the time.  I'm upside down with my fucking just beer belly just hanging out.  Oh, yeah.  I think Ant's ball bag was hanging out because he was fucking hanging the wrong way.  Had the loose shorts on.  You're upside down.  You can't fucking go over the top of the trapeze.  I remember I was scared just walking up that tiny little ladder.  Oh, and he's just like dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. 
[01:03:30]  Right, right, right.  Gets right up there.  So then I hear some commotion outside my fucking room.  And there's my girl at the time, a trapeze guy.  He's walking her home.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  French trapeze guy at 3, 4 in the morning.  That's bad news.  Because I couldn't hang in there anymore.  Oh, boy.  Yep.  Who knows?  These fuckers at Club Med, man.  I'm telling anyone.  Watch out.  That's right.  What you're getting.  All kinds of blowjobs.  Exactly.  Blowjobs.  Club Head.  Captain fucking blowjobs.  Everybody's getting head. 
[01:04:00]  Captain blowjobs.  Fucking Captain Blowjob getting blowjobs everywhere.  Because you go down there with your horribly white middle of the winter body.  Yep.  And these guys are just waiting for the hot chicks.  They don't care if they're married or in a relationship.  They don't care if the guys are even there.  Sucking dick like crazy.  They know how to work every situation.  Yep.  And you're going to lose every time.  And you couldn't be like, wow.  Because you're a hardworking guy that's like, okay, I could afford a little vacation.  Yeah, a little vacation. 
[01:04:30]  Middle of fucking winter.  White, pale body.  Not a muscle because you don't have time to work out.  No.  And then they're fucking ripped, tan.  And they want your chick.  And if they want your chick, there's nothing you could do.  It didn't work for you trying to get your chick back.  You could have been like, yes.  I'll be honest.  I don't know what happened.  Alcohol.  To this day, I don't know what happened.  Who knows?  He's good at trapeze, but he's not that good on the air.  You don't think that would have made a difference?  No.  Remember the big black guy with the exotic name that every girl fawned over down there?  You even remember his name? 
[01:05:00]  He was gorgeous.  Hendel.  Hendel remembers his name.  I remember Hendel.  Hendel was like 12 years ago and you remember his name.  Yeah.  Hendel was this black Jamaican guy that just, he swept every girl off their feet.  Is it a character of Juan based on Hendel?  Yeah, he had girls just hanging off his cock as he walked.  This guy was ridiculous how he was, he was putting up numbers, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's all it was about.  Putting up some fucking all-star numbers. 
[01:05:30]  He'd pick a fucking limping gazelle and just strike.  It was done.  Makes me glad Jess is not at a resort.  Well.  And then you got the guy.  Rio is a resort.  The whole city.  It is.  I've never been.  Well, it is.  Then there's the guy where you go for a little fucking snorkeling.  Oh, God.  And they make you put little floaties on and make you look as stupid.  Sorry, gay guys.  As gay as possible.  And then he, of course, he just jumps in with nothing, which we could do too. 
[01:06:00]  But why?  But then you'd look like a man.  Yeah, then we would look like men.  Exactly.  Our snorkel's got our lips all dead.  You're like, the spit coming out from your snorkel.  The mask is pulling your eyes back.  It's all sideways and full of water.  And then he's just standing on the deck of the boat with nothing but a little fucking speedo on it.  He goes, I'll be right back.  And he does a perfect dive in the water.  He disappears underwater for longer than any of us could hold our breath. 
[01:06:30]  He comes back up and he's going, here's a starfish.  He comes up with fucking aquatic life.  And he's like, don't touch it when you're down there.  I know how to.  All right.  And the girls are getting fucking moist in their bikinis on the boat.  How do you compete with that shit?  He did a jackknife dive like from the 50s off of the deck of the boat.  Fucking comes up.  We all look like fruits.  Comes up with a knife in his teeth.  That type of guy.  Yeah, that guy.  So it may not even matter if I was there with her. 
[01:07:00]  There's not a lot you can do.  That's the point we're making.  Yes, and then you're not, so it's even worse.  That's the point.  She's not at a resort.  Like I said, Rio is a resort.  It's like saying she's not at a resort in Vegas.  Right.  She's staying at a condo in the middle on the strip.  But it's not a resort.  It's not a resort.  That's fucking Rio.  Yeah.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  She's just fucking going crazy hearing that shit.  I can't believe you remember Hendel.  And just saying that name, I will guarantee we'll get phone calls about Hendel after the break. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, that fucking Hendel?  Because a lot of New Yorkers go down a fucking club.  I remember him.  I remember that motherfucker.  He's notorious.  Oh, dude.  Because I fucked my chick.  Knocking him back left and right.  Why don't people like that end up getting killed by somebody?  Like, I don't know.  Know why?  Because by the time you're onto his game, the bus is out front taking you back to the fucking  local airport.  Yep.  And then they see the new fish come in.  Just long enough. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  Just long enough.  Right.  They usually strike around Thursday and you're leaving Saturday, man.  Thursday's a bad day at Club Med for some guys.  Did you feel unsure when she came back with the French guy?  French trapeze guy.  Yeah, extremely suspicious.  And you're just like, what the fuck?  I think there was even an email correspondence that went on after the fact.  Just like, shit.  I don't think I ever brought that one up.  I'm like, why are you emailing the guy?  She was like, I just like trapeze.  Yeah.  I was talking about tightropes.  Should have been a sign, my friend. 
[01:08:30]  Should have been a sign.  Jesus.  Well, there's no tightropes in Rio.  Huh?  They don't have tightropes in Rio.  No.  What?  All right.  Tightrope walking.  All right.  A trapeze.  Again, this can't be true.  Paul and Jersey, are you just, please tell me you're doing this for the radio.  Did we lose him?  Fuck.  I hope not.  Oh, shit.  He waited too long.  He said his girlfriend went down to Jamaica.  Yeah.  And now he has a mixed child. 
[01:09:00]  No.  A mixed race child.  I need to now know if he was just doing that for the radio.  Of course it happens.  Come on.  That happens?  Oh, shit.  Little Hendel.  He's got to raise Little Hendel.  Hendel.  How many kids do you think Hendel has?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  His seed went everywhere.  And he was as black as night, man.  So there'd be no mistaking that.  He was really dark. 
[01:09:30]  He was as black as the night sky.  And it gets dark down there because there's no cities around.  Right.  That's how black this guy was.  Yep.  So even mixed, it would still be dark skinned.  Oh, my God.  That white ain't fucking holding a candle to the blackness.  So you'd have like a dark skinned mixed baby.  You would know.  It was Hendel.  You would know.  I can't believe.  God damn it, Hendel.  You don't remember shit, Ann.  I can't believe you remember his name.  There's certain things that just pop in.  You remember TV shows, movies, and all that.  But you don't remember shit about your life.  You remember it in a second, too. 
[01:10:00]  You remember that guy.  You mean Hendel?  Hendel.  That son of a bitch.  That motherfucker.  He would get the girls around.  They would have little fires at night around the bar area and the pool area.  He would get the girls around and play drinking games.  What the hell?  And you would have to.  Life of the party.  And you would have to sit there and just try to survive going, it could be my girl tonight.  Yeah.  I got to stay up until the fucking sun comes up.  And you can't go up to your girl and be like, don't play with him.  Don't do that.  Just having fun.  Fuck you.  You fucking don't want to. 
[01:10:30]  Then it makes it worse.  And Hendel's like, yeah.  Tell her not to.  Hendel hears that in his ear.  He tilts his head sideways.  They're like, huh?  Huh?  I hear fucking discontent between some of these couples.  And then you would see the husbands and the boyfriends one by one going to bed.  You would try to hang in there as long as you could.  He could outweigh anybody.  Yeah, man.  He slept all day.  What did he have to do?  But get ready to, you know, grab somebody's broad.  Bang tourist girls. 
[01:11:00]  Fucking sprint at them like a cheetah.  You ready to eat?  Yeah.  Hendel got to eat.  He does indeed.  Let's get our eat on, man.  We'll talk about vacation dudes next, I think, because now they're calling.  Oh, are they?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Oh, no.  One before we go.  Mike in Philly.  Mike.  Mike?  Mikey.  What's up, guys? 
[01:11:30]  Hey.  I was 10 years ago.  I was in school.  My girl went down to Jamaica.  And all of a sudden, she came back.  My tic started to hit.  Found out that it ended up being chlamydia.  Oh, boy.  So you came back with a sexually transmitted disease.  Well, she possibly did and passed it onto this guy.  Yeah.  Well, it ain't going to happen in my case.  Oh, boy.  Why is that?  Because my fiance is satisfied.  She's a true blue.  That's right.  She's very happy. 
[01:12:00]  You should have made her put on a rape condom before she went down.  Oh.  A dental dam.  I trust how happy she is in her relationship.  And she wouldn't want to jeopardize that with some fling with Juan.  When was the last time you made her really happy and laugh and smile?  You should have seen the words I sent in these emails.  What emails?  That's great.  She reads these emails and her heart is aflutter.  I'm like a poet.  Yeah.  An e-poet.  Here's one. 
[01:12:30]  And if I haven't been to these islands, I wouldn't believe it.  Right.  But I've been and I believe these stories.  We've seen this stuff first, Pam.  Hey, Paul.  Yep.  Hey, Paul.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, man?  Yeah, this guy I work with, or used to work with, he's not there.  But he went down with his girlfriend in Jamaica or some shit, and he was with, he's really  meek kind of a guy.  And he ends up, she's a party girl.  And then she ends up saying she's staying longer because she had time off. 
[01:13:00]  And she never comes back.  Meanwhile, I'm sending pictures of herself, like four big black guys on his catamaran.  And we're all kind of eyes wide open, like, are you kidding me?  Four big black guys on a catamaran.  You don't want to ever get that picture.  Oh, gosh.  She never came back?  No.  And she had her hair all done in dreadlocks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I will not deny any of these stories.  Nope.  I believe it.  I saw it for myself a few times.  I believe it. 
[01:13:30]  And I saw, like, how they get the voodoo in their own heads, these girls.  Yeah, yeah.  My girl!  At the time.  She got the voodoo.  Well, thank God I'm not meek.  Easily influenced, these girls.  So easily influenced.  It's the atmosphere.  It's the drink.  It's the partying.  It's everything.  All right.  We'll break me.  We'll take some more Club Med phone calls because Club Med is the shit.  Handel's the man.  Handel.  Handel.  He remembers the name.  Handel.  And it's definitely his name, too.  It's all good.  It's all good. 
[01:14:00]  He would walk around going, it's all good.  It's all good.  Trying to be, like, cool with you.  He's like, your chick is blowing him.  And he'd just look at you.  You'd be like, wait, wait, my chick's blowing you.  Right.  And he'd be like, it's all good.  And you're like, yeah, it's all good.  Don't worry about it.  I'll just grab another Sam Adams.  But my girl was out till four in the morning with you guys.  What the fuck?  It's all good.  It's all good.  Don't worry about it.  It's all good.  Everything was all good.  Oh, okay.  So I guess it was okay.  It's all good then.  Vacation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The virus.  Follow the O.P. and Anthony Show online.  Facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.

[01:15:00]  Playing that, of course, because Sammy Hagar is saying he was abducted by aliens, Anthony.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  What is it about?  He needs a good story to sell his book.  Sell his book.  So he put in an abducted by.  Is it like a lost time thing?  He was abducted.  And does he remember anal probes?  Or is it like kind of a lucid dream thing?  Well...  Does he get into details?  Let's take a look at this.  No doubt, Sammy Hagar.  Former lead singer for Van Halen. 
[01:15:30]  Why do they have to put the obvious in some of these stories?  I don't understand who he is.  Has enjoyed a lot of far out experiences in life.  Far out.  But on Monday, the rocker told perhaps his farthest out tale to MTV, he was abducted by aliens.  Or at least his brain was.  In an interview for his new book, Red, My Uncensored Life in Rock, Hagar lets go of what even he admits  might make him sound like a crazy person to some readers.  Crazy person.  He and the reporter are talking about dreams he claims to have had about UFOs. 
[01:16:00]  And when asked whether he believed he had been abducted, Hagar answers, I think I have.  The reporter seems surprised.  What?  Really?  I was kidding.  You seriously believe that?  Yes.  Hagar laughs and goes on to explain that a passage in the book described as a dream in which  he is contacted by aliens from outer space in California was in fact reality.  The tale describes how the beings tapped into his mind through a wireless connection.  Wi-Fi?  Yeah, they Wi-Fi'd his brain. 
[01:16:30]  The alien had Wi-Fi?  They Wi-Fi'd his brain.  It was real, Hagar told the reporter, according to the story, they were plugged into me.  It was a download situation.  Or they uploaded something from my brain, like an experiment.  A riff?  A guitar riff?  Yeah, why is he still making crappy music if they're uploading the real shit to his brain?  Good range for his voice?  Hagar goes on to describe another experience at the age of four where he believes he saw  an alien spaceship in broad daylight hovering over a country field where his family lived. 
[01:17:00]  So he saw a UFO.  I guess.  And then was abducted mentally.  Many years later.  That sounds like bullshit to me.  Yeah, it's just a way to sell books.  Yeah.  You can't put out a book unless you have one really good story.  Did they use a USB up his ass?  Is that how you link up Firewire, perhaps?  Or the new Thunderbolt interface that Apple is putting out?  Very exciting.  Very, very exciting.  Very exciting.  I just got this. 
[01:17:30]  This is a very fascinating coincidence of everything.  What happened?  Well, my girlfriend, she's doing an episode of Law & Order today.  Oh, nice.  With Private Pyle.  Nice.  And Jay Moore.  Jay Moore's?  Yeah, he's in the same episode.  That's very cool.  Yeah, she was at a fitting yesterday for the wardrobe and there's Jay Moore's. 
[01:18:00]  Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's.  Maybe Jay Moore's could stop by.  I know.  I think he said he wanted to.  Maybe we get to Jay Moore's.  You know, he called me.  I don't know.  I didn't listen to the message, though.  Jay Moore's.  Do you listen to your voicemails at this point?  Yeah, I pretty much do.  I, uh, yeah, just setting something off for, we should play what I played you, right?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  The Jesus thing?  Whatever that is.  Yeah, it's weird.  I heard some screaming and stuff.  Sorry, sorry.  I don't listen to my voicemails.  Right now I got four. 
[01:18:30]  That go about a week.  No, I just don't use the phone for a phone anymore.  I don't make calls and I don't want to, I don't want to see who's calling me.  No, you.  Like, why can't you just write me?  Yeah, that would be handy.  I hate when people leave voicemails because they could do that in a, in a text.  I like texts.  I'm a huge fan of the text message.  I hate fucking voicemails.  When my phone rings, I look to see who called and then I figure out, well, is that person  calling because someone died? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  And then I go, no, probably not.  So then I let it go to voicemail and then eventually I, I, uh, listen to my voicemails.  Yeah.  Eventually.  Let's see what this one is.  Let me see.  Um, and the rest of the shit, Anthony, I wasn't going to tell you a lot of stuff, a lot.  I didn't need you involved.  I didn't want you involved. 
[01:19:30]  Just wanted my life back together.  Made things so much worse and I haven't deserved it.  And I haven't deserved a lot of shit that has happened over the last three years.  Really?  But I generally really liked you a lot.  And I tried to be as respectful and cool with you as possible.  Oh yeah?  But between Michael ripping apart my family.  What?  I have no idea what she's talking about. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Anxiety level.  Yeah.  You help bring up a lot more.  Shit's been going on about a year.  To talk to you.  The messages don't stop.  I have you in my life in any way unless it's good.  In any way.  Unless that is, that's my favorite part.  It's like if anybody's going to tell you like that they don't want you in their life anymore.  Yeah.  It's like, listen, listen to what she said.  It's like, it's like, look, I don't want you in my life anymore.  Uh huh.  I don't care to talk to you or have you in my life in any way unless it's good. 
[01:20:30]  It won't be.  And good for me.  Not good for you.  So I got to stick around where it's not good for me.  I'm treated like shit and I don't deserve the shit that I've gone through.  This is great stuff.  I really don't.  Really?  I'm sorry for lashing out at you and everything, but also you helped cause some of it.  These go on forever.  I don't treat people like that. 
[01:21:00]  Wow.  But I had actually given a shit.  I actually liked you.  Did you?  You.  I couldn't even tell.  This is my life.  I don't care to have any contact with you in any way.  Seriously?  Unless it's good.  Again, unless it's good. 
[01:21:30]  Shut up.  Unless it's good.  And good for me.  I need someone that actually gives a shit about me.  Not somebody to hurt me and fuck with me.  I didn't do anything.  I've had enough of it over three years.  And I don't deserve it.  I didn't even know her for...  I deserved a good life, Anthony.  And if you were actually going to give that to me, it's really hard for me to believe that. 
[01:22:00]  A little too much.  Too fast.  But probably that was the whole point, right?  You fuck a girl.  They think you got to dance with him.  It's up to you.  And you know what?  Just...  Whatever.  I don't support you, or show, or any of it.  She doesn't support me, or the show, or any of it.  Not anymore. 
[01:22:30]  Not anymore.  I never will again.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, wait.  How did I get Jess's message from Brazil?  Oh, shit.  It's still going on?  Yeah.  And then it goes off.  That?  Yeah.  I'm so glad you're finally bringing this to the show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I brought it to the compound in a smaller audience.  That's like a test run.  Which made...  You know the limited runs that you do with a movie?  Which made me extremely jealous.  I'm like, why is he giving such great material to the compound show? 
[01:23:00]  But sometimes you've got to release something in a limited run.  And see how it does.  And see how it does.  It's like a preview on Broadway.  Like Spider-Man, you know?  Spider-Man.  You've got to work the kinks out.  Make sure it works.  Make sure the people like it.  That was in previews.  Make sure the people like it.  And then I figured, yeah, I would do this.  My first thought really fast, I don't miss being single.  Ah.  It made me kind of like, kind of shiver.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I know exactly what that's about.  This goes on.  You kind of had a little thing with a girl. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And she thought it was a little more than a little thing.  Yes.  When I'm single, when I was, you know, completely fucking crazy single, yeah, there were things.  There were certain relationships that would last a little while.  Nothing really serious.  Just kind of checking things out.  And then there were just what you would call your flings and things.  And this was a flinging thing that just, like, you bring it, and I'm not trying to sound 
[01:24:00]  like fucking, this is the greatest thing on earth, but when you bring a girl to the house  and it looks all nice and it's fucking, you know, everything's there and you don't have  to worry about a lot of things.  Everything's readily available at your beck and call.  Was it a weekend thing?  Yeah, I think that's, yeah, maybe a little longer, but not much.  Not much.  That was...  And that was it?  Yeah, yeah.  That was it.  And that was it.  And these calls have been going since last spring. 
[01:24:30]  So just about a year.  Yeah.  About a year.  I know you get them every day, because that's...  Just about every day.  Because I've been frustrated for a long time, because your phone will go off, and then you  show me and Jimmy, like, another one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's another.  And I keep looking at you like, let's do something with this.  Yeah, I wanted to see where it was going first.  See, because first, because, you know...  How many do you get a day?  At least one a day, usually.  Sometimes it doesn't... 
[01:25:00]  One doesn't come in for maybe a week or two, and then I'll get, like, fucking five in a  row.  And they all last the four-minute max that you could leave on an iPhone.  So it's the four-minute max, every single one of them.  And then it'll just cut off, and the next one will call...  And then it'll start right back up where it left off.  Do you have any more on that?  Yeah, let me grab another one.  So, yeah, it was a fling thing, and then this whole, like, for three years, three years...  It's like, I didn't know you for three years.  I didn't know what was going on in your fucking life for three fucking years. 
[01:25:30]  It's not my problem.  Maybe you've been talking to her through the radio.  Well, that isn't completely off-base either.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, because I heard some stuff.  It's like, you know, oh, I...  Because I've...  Are you giving...  I haven't put any...  You're giving out secret messages, aren't you?  Yeah, apparently.  I haven't put anything of this on the radio.  Not even talking about it or anything.  And it's like...  But I would hear, like, you know, from voicemails and stuff.  Oh, so you were talking about this situation or that.  I'm thinking, like, no, I wasn't. 
[01:26:00]  And then I just...  I ignore them.  I don't...  I ignore all these calls.  And then one day, she shows up in front of my house.  Shows up in front of my house in her car while I'm leaving for work.  Whoa.  I was like, get the fuck out of here.  Whoa.  Get out of here.  That's funny.  And then, you know, the police have to get involved.  Does she live close?  A report?  No.  I'm talking, like, fucking probably 300 miles away.  So she drove 300 miles just to be in your driveway one morning?  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I actually know this.  I'm just setting it up for the radio audience.  Yeah, of course.  You got to be...  You have to be the audience.  I love tearing down the walls for people.  I already knew that.  You have to be the audience.  That was good, though, wasn't I?  It was good.  I didn't know where you were going with that one.  My acting classes have been pretty damn good lately.  Thanks, Dan.  Let me try one of the newer ones.  Wait, before you...  Yeah.  What I don't understand, why can't...  Hmm.  I don't want to piss off the women.  But why can't women in general see flings, like guys see flings? 
[01:27:00]  Guys see flings.  Like, look, we're just going to have a good time.  Why can't the girls have the same mindset?  Well, let me...  Some can.  Let me tell you something.  I get it.  Some can.  And some guys can't fucking do a fling because they fall head over heels in love with a girl.  And the girl is just like, you know, dude, relax.  And then they become stalkers and shit.  I don't see it that way as much as women misreading it thinking it was more than what it was.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  And this is because, generally, I'm not a fling experience guy. 
[01:27:30]  Like, even if it's a fling, I'll be a nice guy.  I'm not going to be, you know, hey, let's fucking get the fuck out and shit like that.  So I'm a nice guy and I'll, you know, there'll be dinner involved, things like that, hanging out, shit like that.  And then when that turns into, all right, you know, let's...  I'm not available tonight.  I'm going out.  I'm doing it.  It turns into these calls.  It's funny because everyone knows you as the playboy at this point. 
[01:28:00]  Ah, yeah.  Sorry for the horrible old school term.  The playboy.  But I've known you for 17 years.  Most of those years, you were not...  Oh, man, wrapped up.  ...not fling guy.  Wrapped up.  I'm in a relationship now.  Yeah, and you weren't a fling guy.  And now I'm in a relationship.  So, you know.  No, Dawn, it's not her.  Oh, now your sister's trying to figure it out.  My sister's texting me like, who the hell is that?  Oh, she didn't know about this one?  No.  No, I think she did, but she doesn't know who it is. 
[01:28:30]  Is her mouth a gape right now?  Yeah, she's probably like, what the fuck is that?  How many have you gotten in a year?  Wow.  I can't count.  I can't even count.  Because it's also text messages that come in.  Yeah, these are all text messages.  Look at these.  You're just spinning your iPhone right now.  Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning.  You're spinning it as fast as you can, and we're not getting to the top.  They don't end.  They don't end.  And what I notice, there's not one reply from you in there.  They're not replies.  I don't reply.  Why would I reply?  I only saw one color on your iPhone.  I know.  It was just there, and they're all the same things. 
[01:29:00]  You know what you did?  Have you tried to make her stop?  Yeah, I've tried everything.  I've tried the yelling over the phone, like picking up and saying, knock the fuck off.  Don't call me.  I've tried the texting back.  Well, then don't call.  If you don't want anything to do with me, I want to move on with your life, then move on and don't call.  Don't talk to me.  Don't do anything.  And then I called the cops, because there was one that was a kicker.  That one was great.  It's like, you want me to stop?  Yeah, I've got to do it through the hair.  You want me to stop texting and voicemailing you? 
[01:29:30]  I want $10,000.  Is it on a voicemail?  $5,000.  I give that to the cops.  I want $5,000 on one day and $5,000 the next day.  And then I'll stop talking to you.  I was like, oh, cool, extortion.  The cops will love that one.  So the cops got that.  The cops got a whole file and shit.  It's great when you go back for your permit re-up to have somebody such as this. 
[01:30:00]  Makes it easier.  Makes it a lot easier.  So what is her issue?  I think her issue is she's just kind of kooky, a little kooky.  And she thought her time with you was more than it was, obviously.  Yes, definitely interpreted what was going on.  And when you go to the virtual Disneyland that is my house, you don't want to leave.  But there are people that do not want to leave.  Is she one of these?  Now, there's two things that could be going on in her head. 
[01:30:30]  She is extremely pissed that you, quote, used her.  Right.  Or the other scenario where she thinks that she could turn you and that this was meant to be.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Which one of those two?  Because those are the only two, I think.  They're both.  But I get each side of that.  These messages are, the theme of it is either, you know, it's not her either, Dawn.  Dawn is my sister. 
[01:31:00]  I think most people know.  Just in case you don't.  That's funny.  She just keeps texting names.  And I'm like, no.  Yeah, the two you texted are cool.  Dawn Anthony's been in hell.  He couldn't tell you.  He couldn't tell you the hell he's been living.  So I get the ones where it's like, all right, fuck you.  You used me.  You led me on.  And then the other version I get is, oh, you, you know, if you just give me more time and 
[01:31:30]  learn to know me a little more that we can, you know, I'm so perfect for you.  And that's the other one.  So there are two different types of, uh, you got another one, a voice.  Justin Tampa says, Ant, uh, uh, have you thought about changing your phone number?  Why would I fucking get rid of a golden egg laying goose like this?  Right.  This audio is fantastic.  And you've tried everything.  So now you bring it to the show.  Yeah, I've tried everything.  I really have tried everything to, uh, stop these. 
[01:32:00]  So now I just figure, fuck it.  Let's just play them.  Stalkers just have a little fun.  They're just a pain in the ass.  They're really odd things.  Let me see if this one is one.  Because some of these, uh.  Oh, yeah, I still have all your texts of you begging to, uh, keep me around.  Now that, that is hysterically delusional.  I haven't left any texts or anything.  Like, you see all the texts.  I don't answer them. 
[01:32:30]  There's not one reply.  So there's like this weird delusional, like, I still have all your texts.  And it's just the oddest thing.  Let's, um, continue.  Oh, hold on.  We can't.  No names.  Whoops.  Oh, we have no dump now?  I didn't do it.  No, we got a dump.  Did you just pick?  You picked the wrong one?  Yeah, I guess I picked the wrong one.  That's okay.  There's no secrets on this show. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, that's Sal.  Another stalker.  Some friends of mine told me you played my messages.  Uh, yeah.  Whatever.  Actually, I find it kind of funny.  But, whatever.  It's funny how you have to lie about everything.  And you do know about everything.  And it's funny how, you know, you have to lie to make yourself look better and all that shit. 
[01:33:30]  I don't have to do that.  And, uh, she's more white, trash, pathetic, you know.  That's my current girlfriend she's talking about.  I called you out on shit.  Oh, shit.  Die, fucker.  Yeah, it's kind of funny to me.  But, whatever.  I'm quite happy.  Thank you very much.  Sounds like a barrel of laughs. 
[01:34:00]  I didn't do what you wanted me to do, so.  It hurt your feelings.  Aw.  It hurt my feelings.  Yeah, well, whatever.  And Valentine's Day, yeah, I could care less.  Never cared.  So, whatever, Anthony.  You're just not good enough for me, actually.  And, uh, I called you out on all your bullshit and you didn't like it.  So, glad I never, uh, moved 21v2 or jumped 21v2. 
[01:34:30]  What?  Yeah.  More white trash, ghetto, gay-ass shit.  Just more immaturity.  Whatever.  Good luck to the two of you.  You guys deserve each other.  Whereas I, on the other hand, um, I'm actually quite happy.  She sounds...  See ya, bitch.  See ya, bitch. 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  See ya, bitch.  She wouldn't let you do the Angry Pirate.  The Angry Pirate?  I would have loved to have done the Angry Pirate.  So, you're kidding?  She thinks you're, uh, upset because you weren't allowed to do the Angry Pirate.  All right, go ahead, Marissa.  Play the guessing game.  I just got a text from her.  Can I play the guessing game, too?  What, people trying to figure out who it is?  Of course.  Well, a few people know who it is.  The word gets around.  Is there any more?  Oh, yeah.  How many more are on the phone? 
[01:35:30]  On the phone?  Right now.  I don't know, but, um, I don't know.  Probably 25.  You're not joking.  I'm not joking.  I'm not kidding.  Oh, my God.  I would strangle a bitch.  Maybe I can't say that.  Well, you have some with her name on it.  She usually goes under unknown.  You, buddy, you can, um, think whatever you wish about me.  I really don't care.  What did we learn about I don't care?  I don't care means I care so much.  And I was going to put up with, uh, being lied to or mistreated in order to do so. 
[01:36:00]  I deserve a lot better.  I don't sit here whining, crying, bitching, moaning, feeling sorry for myself about everything.  Oh, sorry.  I went there.  No, Dawn!  It's not her!  She's already come up with three names?  Yeah.  God, Dawn! 
[01:36:30]  You had a hell of a run, Sam.  I'm like...  Well, we're getting the typical guy response on instant feedback.  Yeah.  Was she a good lay?  That's all people want to know.  I'm not even going to say.  Was it at least worth it?  I don't know.  Never expected anything from you.  Money, gifts, any of that.  That shit doesn't really matter all that much to me when I'm with someone or whatever. 
[01:37:00]  That shit's just...  I don't know.  People wanted to help me.  Really cared about me.  I don't know.  Just whatever.  Just whatever.  I'll do what I gotta do.  Take care of me.  Never been really coddled or taken care of.  I've always had to do it on my own. 
[01:37:30]  Along with everyone else around me.  You believe this, huh?  I don't know.  I'm getting used to somebody that's wanted to take care of me.  I don't know.  I just didn't trust anybody that's offered to help me.  It's never been a good situation.  And...  I don't know.  I really wanted to trust you. 
[01:38:00]  I wanted things to kind of work out, but...  I know I had to.  Probably never would have.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't.  I don't expect you to ever come back.  I actually guarantee.  Oh, exactly.  I'm not coming back.  I want to actually start over.  And I don't have...  And I've actually gotten my shit together over here.  All I know is... 
[01:38:30]  I need to get out of this date.  Out of this whole situation.  I'm not...  I think guys are ideal.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Whatever I need.  I'll write that one.  Let me find...  Wow.  Let me find this one.  Wow.  This is like...  This is like a plot of a really scary movie.  It is, right?  Single white female.  What was the one with Kathy Bates there? 
[01:39:00]  Misery.  Misery.  Thank you.  It's just been...  Pretty for them.  Like I said...  You know, you're not into girls like me.  And...  You know, they're blowing shit up.  You know, I just...  What hurt me, Jen?  What hurt me?  Yeah, Jim Herbie.  What? 
[01:39:30]  He was an escape.  That was an ex-boyfriend.  And her ex-husband.  It was...  The fact that you...  I gotta hear about her ex-husband all the time.  And it's like...  I don't give a shit.  The fact that you wanted nothing to do with me...  Before.  It was the fact that you...  Pushed me and...  Had a clue.  Go on.  And...  And turned around and... 
[01:40:00]  And pretty much threw me away.  And, uh...  That's what hurt.  What did you expect?  You know, these fucking...  You know, you know...  They're calling it the hand that rocks the compound.  Thank you, Jay.  From Huntington.  I don't need fucking permission.  It's my goddamn fucking voicemails.  They're a free game.  Fair game, motherfucker.  I play whatever I want.  That's how I roll. 
[01:40:30]  It is fair game.  It's a recording.  She knows she's leaving it on a recording device.  Right.  So it's fine.  Your voicemail...  Yeah, my voicemail is my...  Message says, this will be on the radio.  That's what it is.  It's fucking...  Believe me.  That's exactly how it works.  Oh, my God.  Help me!  You need a Mel Gibson...  Soundboard at home.  Follow me first.  Jesus Christ.  You look like a fucking bitch on heat.  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll be your fault.  Oh, my God. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, Mel.  What are you doing, Mel?  That was my side of the conversation?  Yes, yes.  Let me see.  Oh, Marissa!  Hit it with the last one.  You hit it with the last one.  Very good.  Fucking fatal attractions.  Fatal attraction.  Daddy issues much.  People are just way into this.  No, buddy.  That ain't her.  Or...  Papamunaki's saying, play Misty for me. 
[01:41:30]  But, yeah, there's quite a few more that just go on just like this.  And you're not calling back or anything to keep her going.  I tried to figure out some way to make them stop, but they just don't stop.  So they keep going, and I just let them keep going now.  Fuck it.  It seems like she's broken some kind of law.  The extortion thing is...  Yeah, that was a biggie.  That was a biggie.  That was a good one.  And that didn't stop her?  No.  No.  And then she shows up in your driveway? 
[01:42:00]  Shows up right there.  With crazy eyes.  Yeah, with kind of like, I just want to talk for a minute.  I'm like, I'm not saying a word to you.  Get away from here.  I'm going to work.  I said, leave my fucking house area.  And she drove 300 miles.  I gather.  Well, she had to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  Dawn checking in again.  Let me see.  Yeah.  And Dawn...  Hey, Anthony, is it Dara?  No. 
[01:42:30]  Uncle Chip rules.  Let's see.  Is it Dara?  Let's see.  I'll just put that.  Wow.  I got to answer Dawn back.  Dawn's very concerned.  There it is.  She's worried.  There.  She's worried.  I just let her know who it was.  She goes, congratulations, Marissa, for the winning name.  Does she win a prize?  Do we have like a Steven Singer thing we can give Marissa today?  I'm serious.  Yes, Marissa, you've guessed. 
[01:43:00]  You know what?  Lunatic on Anthony's voicemail.  For Marissa guessing the name of the stalker, we have a...  What do you got, Dan?  We got a Marissa.  A $250 gift card to Steven Singer.  To Steven Singer Jewelers.  Marissa, you've won.  We're not even kidding.  We're giving you $250 from Steven Singer for guessing Anthony's stalker's name.  There you go.  We might as well make a little game out of it.  Might as well have fun with it.  Congratulations, Marissa.  Oh, now we have to read the official tag. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, read the info.  Steven Singer Jewelers.  Visit IHateStevenSinger.com today.  Must be at least 18 years or older and a listener or subscriber.  Not open to residents of Alaska, Hawaii, or Canada.  We just gave away $250 from naming Anthony's stalker.  Congratulations, Marissa.  That might be a first for our radio show.  Let's see.  Jace is saying, congrats, Marissa.  You can get a gold-covered restraining order.  But people want to know if it's Richard from the Grey. 
[01:44:00]  Ah, no.  Too many people coming up with that to get credit.  No, that's, uh, no.  Could be Richard.  Richard's dead.  And he didn't even feminine sounding, but not quite that bad.  Did she drive 300 miles nonstop wearing a diaper, Kevin?  Oh, the astronaut woman.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah.  Let's try.  You want to try one more?  Fuck yeah.  This is all I want to do until 10 now.  I know, believe me.  It gives a fuck what Charlie Sheen's up to. 
[01:44:30]  Let's see.  We could, um, see what that one is.  Because sometimes, because she'd always put it under unknown.  Unknown.  Her name.  Hey, someone wants us to turn this into a rom-com movie preview.  Oh, that could be cool.  Tiki Ross, I think, on Twitter.  Yeah, that'd work.  Mm-hmm.  Are those drunken voicemails from Danny?  No.  Jesus.  I think it's more complicated with me, because, like I said, I'm not like every other girl. 
[01:45:00]  Most girls haven't gone through, um, maybe I'm wrong, gone through what I have.  But, um, complicated with me, because you just, you need to just give me space.  Just like I always give any guy any space.  I have to give her space?  I really do.  Because I know. 
[01:45:30]  Knowing guys, being friends with guys, listening to them bitch and moan and being with Michael  and learning.  Oh.  Getting the space.  And you're a liar.  And you're dishonest.  And you're fucked up.  I know.  I know.  I've made an ass of myself.  If they want to change, they're going to change on their own.  Not by pushing them, not by harping on them, not by trying to make time. 
[01:46:00]  And that's something I never wanted to do, is change you.  I liked you the way you were.  Did you?  I liked a lot of things about you.  Did you?  I don't waste my time, you know, um, sitting here, pining over you, pining over you. 
[01:46:30]  Pining?  Who's pining?  It's a waste of time.  Could you elm over me?  More important things.  Oak over me.  You worry about and do with.  And do that.  Or worry about who you're fucking now.  Ah.  Who you're dating.  Or who your girlfriend is.  When you say, I have no time to worry about who you're fucking, and you say it like that.  It's not worth it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I gotta focus on me. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  So do that.  Stop calling.  Getting the fuck away from Michael and a few other people.  Oh my god.  I like to get it.  I didn't lose shit out of me for the last couple years.  I had the last three years, the shit beaten out of me.  Well, that ain't me.  Emotionally.  Oh, emotionally.  Basically.  My shoes fell off.  In the manner possible.  So, um...  Yeah.  And that's what I was doing when I met you, was working on me, and I needed you to keep it what it was what it was. 
[01:47:30]  And as much as I really liked you a lot, I had to keep my distance from you.  You drove 300 miles to your house.  I know.  And I didn't want to push you into anything, and I wanted to keep it light and fun. 
[01:48:00]  She didn't want to push me into anything.  I wanted to push her into something.  If you really liked me a lot, and I wanted to be moved to New York, or whatever.  I wanted to do it when I was...  I got all the texts that are coming into my phone.  ...when I was ready.  But I know, yeah.  I was just another girl.  I'm not stupid.  They'd be able to take care of me for a little while, and...  You know, help me. 
[01:48:30]  One second I'm your friend, and the next second I'm your girlfriend, and the next second I'm just a girl, and the next second I'm...  No, see, the second second, you had it totally wrong.  You can't do that to someone that's been through as much as I have.  I just can't.  And then, see, like, it just cuts off.  Wow, she is fucking crazy, man.  And it just cuts off, and then she just takes back up where it left off. 
[01:49:00]  They, uh, they're calling this one flu over the kumia nest.  The instant feedback is, it's unbelievable.  I can't even keep track of it.  Kevin from Connecticut, I think, said the rom-com would be called The Talker and the Stalker.  No, no, buddy, it's not that one.  But people are, uh...  Yeah, but now Buddy, uh, Buddy's in on it.  Oh, no, Buddy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How you doing, bud?  Yeah.  They're trying to guess.  Is it Liz Wilde?  No, it's Liz Wilde. 
[01:49:30]  Is it, uh, Lydia from, uh, Oceanside?  No, no, it's not Lydia from Oceanside, The Shrink.  Is it, uh, The Radio Chick?  No.  These are, these names are coming in.  It wasn't The Radio Chick.  You must be a hell of a catch.  Um, fuck you, E-Rock.  E-Rock just texts, hey, are you watching the news?  From the other room, you're a dick.  Why would he be paying attention to that?  Uh, yeah, that, uh, God, it's just, it goes on and on, like, that message just ended like 
[01:50:00]  that, and then it'll take up on the next one, right where that left off, just keep talking,  and, um, and nothing's ever said.  It's always, like, the one message you listen to, it's the same in every message.  But it makes it sound like you, you're, uh, corresponding with her, but pretty much since  this fling, I'll call it a fling, maybe, maybe a long weekend fling, I'm thinking.  There you go.  Was it?  That's what it was. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, it's a weekend.  One of those Mondays, everyone has off weekends?  Yeah, a little weekend thing.  And you haven't really had any contact with her since, except for maybe picking up just  to yell and scream, like, leave me the fuck home.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that fair enough?  That's fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Tony Smith?  That's pretty much.  Uh, what?  Or is it Shawnee?  Uh, Shawnee.  Shawnee Smith?  No, it wasn't Shawnee.  It wasn't Shawnee Smith.  Shawnee Smith.  Because she talks like you guys are.  No, she didn't live in Cleveland.  It wasn't, uh, the girl from Cleveland.  No, don't even, don't even answer those questions.  Keep it very vague for. 
[01:51:00]  I'm just going to say that.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, fair enough.  It's not Jill Nicolini.  Should keep it vague, though.  Keep it vague.  Yeah, that's what I do.  I keep it very vague.  This sounds just like crazy ex-girlfriend audio.  Well.  Well, this guy knows who it is.  That's the real deal.  He wants to say, I don't know if we should put him on the line.  He knows who it is.  He talked to her on the computer, and she's definitely not right.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was right.  He's right.  He's right?  Yes, but don't say.  No, I don't think we should go to that call. 
[01:51:30]  No, no.  Wow.  Yeah.  Single white supremacist.  Single white supremacist.  That's fucking good, man.  Bravo, sir.  Bravo.  I say one more.  Yeah?  One more?  They're digging it, man.  Let's see if I'll dig up another one here.  Are these some of the recent ones?  Yeah, some of the more recent ones.  I'm kind of going all over the place, just to prove the point that it doesn't matter where 
[01:52:00]  you take up and leave off on these, they're all the same.  And she talks about her ex beating her emotionally and physically.  Yeah, yeah, that's what I heard there.  I was like, oh.  But what does that have to do with you?  I don't know.  And you let her on in this short period of time that she was going to be your girlfriend  and move to New York?  Yes.  And I would assume you didn't really know much about her before the long weekend fling.  Not a thing.  Yeah, because I kind of know the circumstances.  Yeah.  So why would she assume all that? 
[01:52:30]  Oh, that's a good one.  There's a good one?  They're all good.  Anyone that starts, hey, Anthony, this is hard because I've been having a few drinks.  Oh, boy.  We might have to give out another gift certificate.  Oh, really?  Somebody?  They guessed the name, Ann Coulter.  Fuck.  I need another gift certificate.  I didn't want that out.  It is indeed Ann Coulter.  Conservative pundit. 
[01:53:00]  Ann Coulter.  Let's start the rumor.  It's Ann Coulter.  Oh, God.  Let's hear another one.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah, Anthony, I don't know.  This is hard.  I've been having a few drinks and playing Xbox and playing Call of Duty and shooting and blowing  up shits.  And I don't know.  I thought about it for me here and there. 
[01:53:30]  And it's just been the only difficulty I've had.  And the reason I've had kind of issues with anything with you is the fact that...  Oh, hold on.  You have to pause so I can read this.  And I apologize.  But the instant feedback is like a slot machine right now.  Yeah.  Silly Goose writes from Mineola, Ant's dick must smell like Paxil.  That's very funny. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, my God.  Can you rewind that a little bit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me just take care of this.  I just didn't want that one to pass by.  Is it Debbie Gibson?  Yes.  God damn it.  It is.  Yeah.  What about C-Cup from Fox?  No, Essie?  Essie Cup, right?  Essie?  Yeah, yeah.  We call her C-Cup, though, no?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Essie Cup.  Essie Cup.  You're right.  But hold on.  Some people are so curious. 
[01:54:30]  I'm surprised all your pals don't know.  All right.  There we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Let's rewind a little bit.  There.  Let's go.  I don't know if you have had.  Hey, what happened?  All of a sudden, it's showing Vincent's Pizza.  Voicemail.  Here we go.  Was it this one?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Let's go back.  Anthony, I don't know. 
[01:55:00]  This is hard, because I might have been having a few drinks and playing Xbox and playing  Call of Duty and shooting and blowing up shit.  That, by the way, is supposed to get me to go like, oh, fuck.  Oh, she plays Call of Duty.  Right.  And she's like saying, shooting and blowing shit up.  Like, that's my type of girl.  That's cool.  And she's drinking.  Yeah, yeah.  And she's drinking.  I like when girls drink.  Drinking?  Playing Call of Duty?  That's just fucking...  Ah.  Hey, if you're stopping, then I could read another one of these.  Yeah.  Big Tom in Brooklyn writes, rom-com name, how to lose a guy in one voicemail. 
[01:55:30]  That's pretty good.  Ah, fuck.  Is it Jodie Sweetin?  Oh, God.  Now you fucking totally blew up her spot.  You definitely was.  It was indeed Jodie Sweetin.  You were trying to make time with her when she was in here.  Yes.  Ah.  And, um...  I don't know.  I, uh...  I thought about you from here and there, and it's just been... 
[01:56:00]  The only difficulty I've had, and the reason I've had kind of...  Issues with anything with you, is the fact that...  Not that you pushed me.  It was the fact that you pushed me, and...  Having a clue.  What?  Knowing.  What?  So that it was me.  And, uh...  And, uh...  And then saying, you know...  You pushed... 
[01:56:30]  You know, and you went forth with it, because you really liked me a lot.  Well, and...  You know...  Killing me...  All that shit, and pushing me...  Danny says, sleepless in your driveway.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that fucking good, man.  If you're just tuning in, because we get a new audience every, like, half hour or so. 
[01:57:00]  We're listening to Anthony Stalker.  He finally brought it to our show.  We've known about this for a long time.  Had a quick, long weekend playing with a girl when Ann was single.  You know, he was doing his thing.  Yeah, it was about a year ago.  And she, uh...  She really read this one, uh...  Wrong, and, uh...  Convinced that, uh...  They should be, uh...  Going steady.  Yeah, yeah.  And she has not stopped calling them in almost a year.  Yep.  Without any phone calls from Anthony.  Right.  Without any interaction.  Without any responses or anything, yeah.  From Anthony. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  And these are...  And these go on and on.  And I have, like, hundreds of these.  It's crazy.  Hundreds.  It's crazy.  When I went through, it just...  It's been really hard.  If you had confronted me straight up, straight to the point, and put that file in front of me.  What?  And said, hey, what's this?  Because honestly, I don't even remember everything.  I would have gone through it with you. 
[01:58:00]  Gone through what?  And, uh...  It was an escape.  An escape from all the yelling, the fighting, the family drama, and bullshit that I just needed to get away from.  And I wasn't thinking straight.  I used alcohol.  I used anything possible to escape from...  A lot.  I didn't tell you a lot. 
[01:58:30]  You'd think I might have, but...  I really didn't tell you a lot of what was going on.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Chris in Ohio.  You got a good one?  The bipolar express.  American history ex-girlfriend.  Even though it wasn't a girlfriend.  Oh, God.  Wow, man.  You're in hell, man.  Yeah, this was a...  We got a therapist on the line, not Lydia. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, okay.  I think we've had Steve on before.  Steve, we've had you on, right?  Yeah, I'm a therapist.  Steve?  Yes, good morning, boys.  We've had you on before, no?  Yes.  Okay, good.  What's your take on this whole thing?  My guess is she was obsessed with Anthony for a long time before he met her, and she's  slightly delusional in a psychotic way, because while I'm sure the affair was great for her, 
[01:59:30]  she put a lot more meaning to it than is even reasonable for someone who was normal and hoped  more would come from it.  Indeed.  Yeah, she's completely obsessed.  You've wrapped it up there.  What is the threat level?  Obviously, this is your opinion.  Well, you know, it's funny.  I wanted to ask Anthony, in the amount of time he spent with her, what sort of appreciation  did he get for any potential for violence with her, especially after playing her tapes 
[02:00:00]  now on the air, which I'm sure she's aware of?  No, I didn't get any inkling that there would be any violence or anything like that.  There was nothing like that.  I just got the, you know, this is one of those just kind of, they don't stop calling.  Don't stop calling.  That's pretty much all I got out of it.  And she perpetuates the chance of getting back with you.  Yes, that's what I noticed, that whole...  Well, speaking to your voicemail, it's the connection that she keeps. 
[02:00:30]  And it's interesting because in some of them, she makes herself the victim.  And then, you know, in some of the parts of the voicemail messages, she makes herself,  like she's standing up for herself and, you know, like claiming victory.  It's very polarized.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then she'll be like, you know, I could take this.  I could do this.  I do it on my own.  I've done it before.  I'll do it again.  And then it's like, oh, you know, I'm perfect for you. 
[02:01:00]  How does this shit stop?  This would drive me nuts if it was me.  I don't care.  Well, she's going to find a new next victim.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what happens.  Yeah, yeah.  But the fact that Anthony is accessible via the radio is going to make that very difficult.  Yes, exactly.  Yep.  So I would...  You're good, sir.  I would keep strapped, my friend.  I wouldn't worry about it. 
[02:01:30]  All right, I'll punch it out.  Thank you, sir.  Good job, Steve.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's see what else he's saying here.  You still have no clue of anything that has gone on.  Oh, with the husband and the boyfriend.  And as far as what I've gone through lately, I know you can't handle...  The truth.  I understand. 
[02:02:00]  I am.  Yeah.  You know, one person only takes so much, and I've genuinely really liked you a lot.  Not for what you could do for me, or vacations or anything else, but just...  I liked hanging out with you.  I am.  That was her...  I'm really...  Yeah, boyfriend.  Realistic.  No rumor mill going, it's boyfriends and ex-husbands and things from three years ago. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know.  You know, I really do have a...  Michael.  Oh.  But, you know, into girls like me.  You know, I like to just kind of go work and chill at home.  Yeah.  Have a few drinks.  Right. 
[02:03:00]  Play Xbox Explosions.  Shit up.  And hang out.  See, we get along great.  Throw a fire in the fireplace.  Fireplace?  I got one of those.  Hang out.  Have some fun with some people.  Choke around.  Bullshit.  And, uh...  Oh, my God.  And then it just...  And then time.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Here's a memory that I forgot all about.  Thank you, Bambino03. 
[02:03:30]  Hey, Ant, is this Lynn's mom?  Is she still dating Opie's son, Joey?  Whoa.  Remember that from N.E.W.?  Yeah.  Remember Lynn and we got her on the phone?  Linger longer.  She thought she was having a relationship with you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy shit, I remember that.  Didn't she, like, write Anthony a letter or something like that?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Wow, good job. 
[02:04:00]  That's something I forgot about a long time ago.  Another fucking psycho.  Oh, my God.  Let's see.  We could play it at 10, E-Roxane.  I don't know.  Listen to it and see if it makes sense today.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Oh, here's a great observation.  Joe in Jersey.  Go ahead, Joe.  First off, Ant, if you wanted to stop calling you, why don't you just play your first appearance  with Opie from 94? 
[02:04:30]  Nothing on that.  Nah, your phone broke up, dude.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Did it?  Listen to how angry you are.  Hey, it was a good line, but we're not going to give you anything for it.  All right.  Sorry.  Just realize it's a good line, and you got Anthony, you got, you know, it's fine.  Yeah, I know, but my...  Although, for the time, I truly thought that was an amazing fucking first appearance. 
[02:05:00]  It led to everything else.  Right.  All right, Joe.  Go ahead, man.  My thing about it is that whenever these numbskulls leave these voicemails like this, every voicemail  sounds like it's going to be the last one.  Right.  30 more.  Holy shit.  You're so right.  It sounds like the last one, and it's like, ah, good, I'm not going to have to deal with  this anymore.  It either sounds like you're never going to hear from her again, or you're going to hear  a shotgun.  It's like, there's nothing else that could be, except she just goes on with her delusions 
[02:05:30]  over and over again.  Well, I'm just, that's probably the only time I'm glad I'm not rich.  I'll say that right now.  All right.  Good.  All right, gents.  Good job, Joe.  And we did enjoy your line.  Yes, exactly.  Silly goose is back when Harry committed Sally.  Goddamn, that's funny.  Yeah.  What was the one Danny had before?  When a stranger calls and calls and calls and calls and calls and calls and dial E for 
[02:06:00]  extortion.  Is she one of the older bruds, or is she a youngster?  No, I'm not even putting an age range in there.  I'm not even going to.  Is she old enough to know better?  I put 16 year olds in that category.  No, I would say yes, of course, old enough to know better.  Because people are, I want to just throw some people off the track a little bit. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Off the scent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, you know, so that's, that's part of the deal.  Part of what I live with, which is, you know, fun.  A lot of fun.  I played it on the compound show a few times and.  And it did well.  And shook it out.  Yeah.  It did very well.  Got a nice graphic.  Got a nice graphic that goes up before I play them.  Nice.  You know, you got to, you got to put some production value to these things, you know?  Of course.  You can't just throw them out there. 
[02:07:00]  I don't want to beat a dead horse, but they're begging for one more, Ant.  Really?  They really are.  This is not me.  And I, I love running things into the ground, but they really want this.  They want this until 10 o'clock.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  Pretty annoying woman is coming in from cigars and scotch.  Which, let's see, let's see, if you have one more, this will be a little while. 
[02:07:30]  Let me just do this.  Oh, 500.  You got to know the movie, but stink throttle.  Very good from Connecticut.  500 calls of summer based on 500 days of summer.  Yes.  Yes.  You saw that movie.  Very good.  Okay.  Let me find one.  I'm going to go back to the, what's up here?  Let me see if there's a.  Dude, you should be categorizing these into like, you know, two stars.  Oh, I know.  Two stars.  Yeah, exactly.  Four stars. 
[02:08:00]  Driving Miss Crazy.  Brian in Jersey.  Oh, shit.  Let's see if I've done this one.  I'm never going to contact you.  That's a good one.  Wait, I heard never going to, hold on.  Never going to contact you again.  I heard that, right?  Right, right, right.  How many calls have you gotten since this?  Oh, be honest.  Dude, this is February 7th.  This one came in.  The, I'm never going to call you again.  So that's over a month ago and you've had a few since then.  Yes, of course.  Okay, let's go.  I'm never going to contact you in any way, shape, or form after this, and I don't care 
[02:08:30]  to.  I will live my life, go wherever I wish, and I will not revolve my life around you in any  way, shape, or form.  I do not support you, the show, or any of you.  Neither do my friends.  We don't care to even have anything to do with you, the show, anything.  We're all supportive and everything. 
[02:09:00]  Nobody gives a shit anymore.  Well, that's true.  I had my, my head, my emotions, and shit with Jim for three years, and all I've wanted for  three years, three years, just to move on with my life, and get out of the state, and  just start my life over.  Why does she keep bringing up ex-boyfriends and husbands, and three years ago, that have  nothing to do with me?  Like, that I'd like an analyst to, to, to, to hop on. 
[02:09:30]  Like, why?  She's saying the same shit over and over again.  How relieved were you when she said, I'll never contact you again?  I knew it was fucking, uh, not happening.  But did part of your brain go, man, maybe she means it this time?  Yeah.  Maybe.  Fuck.  You did what Mike did to me.  You brought up stuff that you had no right in doing.  What?  Or the qualifications of doing.  And the worst part was, you did it when I was drunk. 
[02:10:00]  What?  I was already defensive with you.  You caused more of it.  I did?  You caused me to be like that.  I don't lash out at people.  I don't do that shit.  I didn't deserve that in any way.  You helped undid everything that, for the past year, I have been trying to straighten out 
[02:10:30]  my life, my head, my emotions, and everything that Michael has put me through over the past three years.  Uh-huh.  I tried very hard without much support or anything from anyone I've done it on.  I don't think it cut out.  But once again, it went to Vincent's Pizza.  Um, I think I keep, my iPhone's a little busted. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, so it's like, uh...  Yeah, let me make sure this is...  And the rest of the shit.  Oh, hold on.  The rest of the shit?  Yeah, that was...  I'm never going to contact you for the most part.  I didn't deserve any of that.  At all.  I never wanted anything from you or expected anything from you.  At times, you disrespected me, talked shit, you told lies about me, just lied in general.  All of that made me be the way I have been. 
[02:11:30]  And the whole...  I'm the bad guy.  I'm the bad guy.  You said because I liked you a lot.  Well, I find it hard to believe.  Because if that was true and genuine, you would have worked things out.  You would have sat down and gone through everything with me.  And I would have gone through everything step-by-step with you and why things happened.  Doesn't that sound fun?  Going through things step-by-step and working things out after a week. 
[02:12:00]  After, like, a fling.  You really want to work things out.  You know, I don't work things out with a wife!  What?  Hold on a minute.  Oh, he had a great line.  This fucking V-back is going by too fast.  What was the Eat, Pray movie?  Eat, Love, Pray?  Oh, Eat, Pray, Love or something.  He turned it to Eat, Love, Pray that she shuts the fuck up and stops calling you. 
[02:12:30]  Something like that.  All right.  That, you did it, you did a lot of shit while I was drunk.  And I didn't trust you and defensively with you to begin with.  It wasn't cool, Anthony.  And I really, generally, had liked you a lot.  And you're pushing, really.  I just, I couldn't have any of what you did happen again.  Not what I was trying to deal with Michael, family, and figure out what I want to do and where I want to go and trying to work out a lot of shit. 
[02:13:00]  Desperately seeking professional help.  That's seriously all I've wanted.  And you just really fucked with me a lot. 
[02:13:30]  And, you know, obviously it was all fake.  I don't know.  I can't tell because one second I care about you the next second, saying you don't, then your actions are doing one thing, then the opposite again.  It's the same shit Mike did to me.  Same shit.  That's why I've been fucked up for the last three years.  That's when I had a breakdown along with...  And then it just stops. 
[02:14:00]  But I think it takes up here.  Wait, before you do that?  Yeah.  Utter disgrace on my Twitter writes, exit through the psych ward.  Homeless Jim writes, the cunt's speech.  And someone on Instant Feedback just writes in big, bold letters.  Yeah.  I'm not bipolar.  Great.  Is that her?  No, that's Charlie Sheen.  He says that.  Oh, okay. 
[02:14:30]  I'm not bipolar.  I'm by winning.  Okay.  Is CBS going to call her for a sitcom, you think?  They should.  Sure.  Yeah.  Sure.  Two and a half personalities.  Message in a bottle was a rom-com, right?  I believe so.  And for president on Twitter writes, message in a bottle of Xenix.  People are trying to figure out other names that are in this phone call, and you're absolutely  not correct. 
[02:15:00]  That's all I'll say.  No, no, no.  That's all I'll say.  There's, I wouldn't play them if anyone knew anybody else in these, to tell you the truth.  Exactly.  They're exes that treated her poorly.  Wow.  Oh, you said it picks up.  We're just trying to get to the end of this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the end of that one, and now she realized it ended.  Chris in Boston, always good for one on instant feedback, writes, black swan dive off a bridge!  All right, this is where it takes up after it cut off the last one. 
[02:15:30]  Right away, she called back.  And the rest of the shit, Anthony, I wasn't going to tell you a lot of stuff.  A lot.  I didn't need you involved.  I didn't want you involved.  Just wanted my life back together.  My life back together.  What did you do to her?  Do you realize I didn't call or anything? 
[02:16:00]  Nothing.  Nothing.  You showed her a good time.  I showed her a good time.  How was the, uh...  And that's it.  How was the, uh...  I'm not going to get into that.  What?  I'm not even going to get into that.  I can't even fucking remember.  Was it?  Believe me.  I'm not even going to get into that.  I'm not even getting into any of that.  I'm not getting into any of that.  I'm not going to say a word.  But the thing is, when she's saying, I want my life back.  I just want my life back.  I'm not doing anything to take your life away from you. 
[02:16:30]  Or she's getting her life back.  All she has to do is not call me.  Right.  Darren in Oyster Bay writes, full straight jacket.  Full straight jacket.  Oh, God.  It's, uh...  Are we, uh...  We're...  Picks up?  We're just trying to get to the end of this one.  Oh, yeah.  And then we'll try to move on to other things.  I don't even know what we do after this.  And I haven't deserved it.  And I haven't deserved a lot of shit that has happened over the last three years.  But I generally really liked you a lot. 
[02:17:00]  And I tried to be as respectful and cool with you as possible.  But between Michael ripping apart my family and everything else...  Oh, my God.  What am I going to fucking...  I don't care about the exes.  You help bring up a lot more.  I don't care to talk to you or have you in my life in any way unless it's good. 
[02:17:30]  That's the good part of it.  Good for me.  Not good for you.  I don't deserve to be treated like shit.  I don't deserve the shit that I've gone through.  Right.  I don't deserve to be treated like shit.  I don't deserve to be treated like shit.  I don't deserve to be treated like shit.  I don't deserve to be treated like shit.  I don't deserve to be treated like shit.  I'm sorry for lashing out at you and everything, but also, you helped cause some of it.  I did?  Really?  I don't treat people like that.  Really?  But I had actually given a shit. 
[02:18:00]  I actually liked you.  You, I couldn't even tell.  Oh, my God.  That about sums it up anyway.  Magic rat from Atlanta?  Yeah.  Desperately seek anxiety.  Holy shit.  Robert from Birmingham. 
[02:18:30]  Where is that?  Hold on a minute.  Where the fuck did he go?  I don't want to ruin any of these.  Ah, where did it fucking go?  Hold on a minute.  Uh, um, there's, there's something about Mary that wants me to get a restraining order.  Something like that.  Fuck.  They're flying by now.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Apocalypse me. 
[02:19:00]  That's, um...  Wow, man.  Jesus.  That's, uh...  I'm glad you finally brought it to the show.  It should be...  It should be, uh, freeing for you.  It should be a regular feature.  It sure should.  To tell you the truth, any new ones that come in, we could just, uh...  Yeah, maybe that'll make her stop.  You know, play them and, uh, see what happens.  She needs to fucking stop.  Yeah, yeah.  Just stop already.  This plays right into my wheelhouse, man.  Just stop.  This fucking me, me bullshit.  Me.  Just move on with your fucking life.  I know.  Please.  Please.  Holy shit. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  No sense or sensibility.  They got on.  Shane and Philly, he's a good one to follow on Twitter.  He writes, how to lose a guy in 10 million calls.  Failure to hang up just came in.  Failure to hang up.  Oh, that is good.  You guys are funny motherfuckers.  That's funny.  Take Me Home Tonight's a new movie, but, uh, this guy, Miguel's Perr, I don't know, 
[02:20:00]  whatever.  You gotta get a better Twitter name if you want publicity on our show.  I tell all you guys that.  Take Me Home Tonight at Your Own Peril came in.  At Your Own Peril.  Uh...  It was just supposed to be a good time, right, Ant?  This is every guy's nightmare.  That's why I think this is great.  Not a...  Yeah.  I think most of us have had stalkers in our life.  In our lives.  Yeah.  Some kind of fucking, uh, you know.  It's a person that won't stop. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, you just...  Kind of a thing.  You just assume when you're in a situation in a bar or whatever, and you see that girl  and you want to get a little action or whatever, you just assume she's on board with what it's  about.  It's whatever.  But every once in a while, man, you catch a bad one.  I gotta, you know, I gotta be fucking, uh...  You know, Mr. Fucking Commitment, and...  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Whatever.  40 days and 40 nights worth of voicemails.  The DNA Project, but you have underscores and shit in your name. 
[02:21:00]  No one's gonna follow you, because they're not gonna be able to find you, buddy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's fucking funny.  A padded room with a view.  JHD's I-95.  Ugh.  All right.  Well, you're doing the right thing, right, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  People worry about you.  Family worries about you.  We're worried about you.  Oh, please.  The authorities are involved.  They were.  While back.  Now it's just kind of what it is. 
[02:21:30]  I just leave it.  I take the voicemails, I play them on various shows, and, uh...  But she said you'll never hear from her again, so...  Yeah, so I guess that's a good sign.  But that was how many voicemails ago?  Oh, wow.  Ten?  Yeah, probably.  Ish?  More than that.  When was the last one?  Um, probably...  She's been a little while.  Been going maybe a week.  Ooh.  I haven't got...  But I've gotten a lot of text.  Um, which, by the way, hold on.  Let me see if I can find one of these.  Real fast.  Uh, here we go. 
[02:22:00]  Do-do-do.  Doink.  We'll go here.  We'll go right there.  There it is.  Um, wow, this goes on and on.  On and on.  Phew.  I felt bad if you actually did like me a lot.  I didn't want you to pay my bills, even though you offered to help.  Didn't and don't want a sugar daddy thing either with anyone. 
[02:22:30]  Don't and don't want to fling with you or anyone.  Don't ever think I didn't appreciate you, especially from a guy who is a sign of manipulation.  Like, she'll say, she'll write things that you have no idea.  Uh, it just, like I said, it goes on and on.  It goes from being like, hey, you know, it was cool.  It was cool.  To, you're an asshole. 
[02:23:00]  Uh, so, anyway, that's, that's my, that's my, uh, one of my little, uh, nightmares.  All started, because I said I got a voicemail from Jay Moore.  Yeah, Jay Moore's.  Maybe I should fucking see, I should play his voicemail, see if he's stalking.  Jay Moore, actually, Jay Moore right now is on set with, uh, with my girlfriend.  Nice.  They're filming a Law & Order episode.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  And she just sent me a picture that looks, like, why do they make girls up that are supposed 
[02:23:30]  to be models in a show to look ridiculous, like, crazy?  It's like, alright, it's gotta be a model, so we gotta make them those real crazy models.  Is she playing crazy on Law & Order?  Nah, she's just playing a model.  But they put her hair up like the Bride of Frankenstein.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it looks silly.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  But apparently she's involved in a photo shoot thing with Jay Moore.  Oh, cool.  Like, that's part of the storyline. 
[02:24:00]  And then I guess Private Pile comes in or something.  Is Jay Pervy a photo guy?  Oh, that would be funny if he's a photographer.  Is he a Pervy photographer?  Jay Moore's!  You wanna bet that's what he is?  He's probably the Pervy photographer.  Right.  Alright, let me, uh, let me take a shot of you here.  Oh, that was the line I missed.  Thank you for, uh, doing that voice.  Bridges of Nassau County.  Bridges of Nassau County. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, God, that is fantastic.  Alright.  A lot of funny motherfuckers.  Look what's here.  My turkey chili.  Yeah, let's eat some more food.  I don't even know how we continue doing radio after that, so maybe we should go home early.  Yeah, that's worth the price of admission right there.  No kidding.  I say.  Uh, we'll figure something out.  We're professionals.  Stay there.  Save message Sunday, 9.04 p.m.  You're so fucking hot.  I have a big cock.  I want you to suck it.  I told Betsy, Betsy's so jealous. 
[02:25:00]  If you agree with this, when I see you, walk by me in the hallway.  Don't punch me in the face.  I want to get Betsy in and just pick up Jay Mansfield's head and eat it.  If you're into this, just breathe while you're in the office.  Oh, I just want to put white powder in an envelope and dump it in your face and fuck you all.  Betsy, let's eat the hooker's ass.  If you want to suck my cock, just look at me stupidly and kind of half smile.  You have no more messages.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah, this is the Opinion 3 Show.  Damn it.  My pal Justin Stangle from Letterman's Show. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  One of the head writers.  You know him well, too.  Sure, sure.  He wrote nine and a half weeks at a mental hospital.  They came in during the entire break.  Oh, yeah.  We took a bit of a longer break than usual there.  And we also, I guess you got to hear some of that lunatic guy stalker phone message. 
[02:26:00]  Dimitri.  Dimitri.  Remember Dimitri?  Yeah.  That's a great one.  He was a classic as well.  So it does work both ways.  But I think there are more female stalkers than...  You think?  I think so.  I don't know.  Guys are really possessive.  I really think so.  I think the guys are the ones that usually will kill a bitch.  Yeah, well, that's true.  Guys will take it a little more...  Take it a little further.  Women, they'll just fucking boil your pet or something in the end.  Do something that's just completely whacked. 
[02:26:30]  Hey, why haven't you mentioned that your buddy there, William Shatner, is 80 years old today?  Bill Shatner.  We have anything for Bill's 80th birthday?  Hello, Bill.  We should find something.  Yeah, William Shatner, 80, huh?  I was telling Ann before the show, he's a good 80.  Yeah, yeah.  He seems to be holding up all right.  Pat Cooper's a good 80, although Pat Cooper's now about 82.  And I was telling Ann, I was like, these guys that get a little older, it must be really strange to see their peers in old age homes and walk in the streets just completely clueless. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  At any second, they could be fucking wiped out by a bus or something.  And you're the same age going, fuck, I don't look or feel that way at all.  Yeah, he's doing shows, he's active.  And some of these guys do end up doing shows in old age homes, and they're doing their act for people that are probably younger than them.  That's easy, I guess.  But William's a good 80.  He's a solid 80.  He's still doing it big time.  He's done good his whole career.  We love having him on the show.  I know, I'd love to have him back on. 
[02:27:30]  80 years old.  Fuck, William Shatner is 80 years old.  And isn't, let me think, is Leonard Nimoy older or younger than him?  I would guess he's got to be older.  I thought older.  He has to be older, I'm guessing.  Happy birthday, William Shatner, with his dentures.  Bob Costas, there's no way he's only 59.  He's been around forever.  There's no way Bob Costas is 59 today.  Bob Costas. 
[02:28:00]  And the situation...  Is he also?  Huh?  Um, uh, Leonard Nimoy.  We got an age on him?  Younger.  By?  By?  Seven years.  Four years.  Four years.  Four days.  Four days.  Oh, my God.  He got his pants.  He puts four and then types in days.  Uh, and the original situation, Wolf Blitzer, 63.  Situation room, yes.  Well, if he's in the situation room, that means he's the situation.  And for once, that fucking TV show makes sense, the situation room. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  What do we got?  We got Libya.  We got Japan.  We got, uh, we had the, uh, Egypt thing.  One after another.  Well, there's also other things going on in, like, Yemen and stuff.  So he's got that situation.  Why not Yemen is starting to happen?  And it could be, you know, tsunami, earthquake cleanup, and then nuclear power plant on another  screen.  And, oh, my God, where do we go?  And, yeah, it's a situation room.  Do we know where Anderson Cooper is today?  Is he safe?  Do we know?  Can we Google Earth that guy?  I don't know where he is.  Where is he today? 
[02:29:00]  We should just have a tracking device on him so we know at all times.  He seems to be in danger a lot.  Danger.  That's no way to live your life.  He's getting punched somewhere.  And he's also a journalist.  F-15 jet crew.  He's a journalist.  Oh, let's see, because it's...  Yeah.  I just crack myself up sometimes.  What were you saying?  Uh, F-15 jet crew, safe in U.S. hands after crash.  I guess they went down in, uh, in Libya.  We lost an F-15?  An F-15 went down. 
[02:29:30]  Uh, they, they say it was mechanical problems.  They didn't say they were shot down or anything.  Okay.  Uh, but I heard now this morning on the news that we weren't involved in any of the flyovers.  Like, the French and the Brits were taking care of the actual flying over and, and using aircraft in the bombardment.  And we were just firing, like, cruise missiles.  So for a plane to now be crashing in Libya, that would obviously mean we were, you know, using planes. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, okay.  So that's, that's a little odd.  Ah, they never tell us the truth.  Yeah.  No matter who's in office, by the way.  Man.  Uh, Bob Cost is 59.  And then we just mentioned this name because we like saying her name.  Mm.  Reese is 35 today.  You want to take this one?  Huh?  Reese.  Who?  With her.  Oh, wait.  How old is she?  35.  35.  Happy 35th birthday, Reese Witherspoon. 
[02:30:30]  Hi, I'm Reese Witherspoon.  I hate when she says her name.  It's the easiest name.  It's Spoon.  Spoon.  Say Spoon.  Reese Witherspoon.  Hi, I'm Reese Witherspoon.  Please give to, uh, the Spoon.  Yeah.  And for the Fagulas, uh, Andrew Lloyd Webber is 63 today.  Owl.  One for the Fagulas.  Owl.  Hey, uh, I hear James Franco's placing some blame on his, uh, Oscar appearance there as host 
[02:31:00]  of the Oscars on, uh, the writer, uh, Bruce Valanche.  Really?  Is that his name?  Bruce Valanche?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's saying that he, uh, wrote, uh, shit for him.  And that's why he was so, like, shitty?  Sucky on, on the, uh, the Oscars.  Nah, he was gonna suck no matter what.  Meanwhile, it looked like...  If Chris Rock wrote for the guy, he was gonna suck.  It looked like he was stoned with something.  He looked like he wasn't into it at all.  Yeah.  But that's, like, the big thing.  Bruce Valanche.

[02:40:30]  on here is that somebody i think is overcompensating for oh gayness oh shit manliness oh shit femininity  and gayness yeah i don't know you're not gonna get your ass handed to you now there's some weird  things going on so you're telling me that these bathroom habits are suspect but i think gay guys  isn't even peace sitting down yeah but mars is so afraid of being a gay guy that he is  it's got nothing so that's why he's so that's why he's always talking about fighters and fighting 
[02:41:00]  oh my god this is some of the most horrible stuff i've ever heard not coming out of my mouth 
[02:41:30]  a custodial engineer right oh he's taking shots at you oh he's an engineer i came in here to do my  job what job is that yeah finally jesus christ we've been waiting seven years  oh shots and shots he's just making it this is crazy wow this is crazy you guys hurt my feelings  and mars got nothing back have you noticed that he's just taking shots and shots and shots and he's got 
[02:42:00]  nothing to come back with i mean i don't know how to fight that i mean i it's not a gay bone in my  body yeah oh shit oh shit in your asshole oh boner bone in your body man oh now most people do sit  down and if you're taking a dump you'll just you know you you feel like you take piss you just take  piss while you're sitting down because you're taking a dump you're there yeah you stretch your  ball bag out a little bit so everything you know and who's seeing you to say that you're a bitch  well no it's not it's not like i've never done it i have done it but shag 
[02:42:30]  honestly  it's a girl's name the a at the end it feels very uncomfortable peeing when i'm sitting for some  well but what feels more uncomfortable holding in the piss while you're taking a dump sometimes  that piss just comes out when you're taking a dump yeah but if i have enough time i'll stand  up and turn you know stand up turn around and pee in the toilet why would you wait how only 
[02:43:00]  bitches pee sitting down that wasn't my reasoning i just that's just the way what am i a bitch i'm  old man i'm a man puerto ricans have a lot of time on their hands well mars i mean spend all that time  in the bathroom you don't do much you can spend some extra time oh oh another shot unanswered well  another unanswered shot ouch well it's it's obvious that we need some time filled up in  this show because we're bringing up my fucking bathroom oh well that was a shot at it i think 
[02:43:30]  that wow you're so far this show has a theme today and i think it has a lot to do with uh psychological  imbalances oh which clearly you have oh because you won't shit and piss at the same time  a reversal a reversal we're all bringing up personal items there was jess in brazil there  was your voicemails now there's mars peeing like a bitch like a bitch like a bitch it's like like a  bitch who what what man did mars kiss as a child that he has to know that's the best to not stand 
[02:44:00]  every single let me ask you guys this other question this is something else i do all right  no i've never sucked cock no i also i'll say jerk off until i'm about to come but i don't  i also wipe when i pee that's like a bitch your ass that means you got a leaky hose you  dab you dab your little pee hole no i like now that's you you're saying that's not like a

[02:51:30]  seeing why badly done things why did this get so far well that's the luck factor also you gotta have  the luck factor with a viral video it's because there's a shitload of girls and guys trying to  do the justin bieber and they sound like shit selena gomez miley cyrus thing it's just  i don't know what happened to your voice danny i don't know i'm actually trying to get a real  answer because this is no i hear you this is a weird phenomenon because then you look at the video 
[02:52:00]  and like we saw yesterday there's i don't know 30 000 dislikes and i don't know 5 000 likes whatever  millions of yeah yeah it's like it's the perfect encompassment or whatever you want to call it of  everything that's wrong with popular music that is yeah okay i can i it's everything the auto  tuning the bad video it's the the processing on the voice it's the bad the words it's the black rap  guy for his fucking cameo in it yeah and just the fact that it sounds like every other thing that's 
[02:52:30]  out there i mean i'm not surprised that there's 30 million views on that on that clip all right here's  one yeah kim kardashian uh released a song recently no one gave a shit because she's pretty  fucking famous for for being like you know whatever do you want her to be famous or not  because obviously for a song didn't do anything but she's maybe she's not as famous as uh she's  extremely famous but she released that song and no one cared on any level like they didn't like  watch it a shitload of times because it was so bad you know what i mean yeah i do but it's like 
[02:53:00]  it's like saying well why is one song popular it's that's exactly what we're saying why is one  song popular one song is not that's why i don't understand why it's this one and she came out of  nowhere she had no backing behind her right it wasn't like it is all independent there's no  was there an usher involved no there was no usher involved two two half-assed like rap producer guys  uh yeah but those guys are out there trying to get a yeah yeah a youtube sensation left and right  and it's not happening it's just it's it's there's a luck factor and it's just how these things work 
[02:53:30]  some of them hit some of them don't some of the bad ones hit some of them don't what about that dumb  guy leave brandy alone right that was huge right and no one liked that and there was a million of  those type of guys trying to do that right yeah it's just like luck of the draw sometimes and but  now she's on gma now she's doing a mall tour because she's you know why because she's very like  nice about the whole thing she's like well i know people said bad mean things she's gonna do an acoustic 
[02:54:00]  version of it yeah this is this is this is golden voice guy all over again except some girl with some  music oh yeah it's the same thing god damn what i know by netflix me i suck hold on a minute i just  was reminded of something you wanted you want something so fucking hateable please please do i  did i save this one i didn't save it oh danny you gotta find this because it's the youngest public  fucking the eye right now that's why we're talking about the dumb fucking song again shut up leave

[02:56:30]  are you you are the youngest fashion designer in the country is what i hear yes i am the youngest  and you got your first sewing machine at age six yes i did get my first sewing machine at age six  after begging for like a year do you remember the moment that you had the epiphany that you wanted  to be a fashion designer yeah i do that was like the moment when i was tying ponytail holders in the  back of my dresses to make them fit and i was just like wait a second wouldn't it be like amazing 
[02:57:00]  she is so fucking annoying thank you wow that is an annoying kid your natural reaction  like she leans back  wow yeah but you know that's not her fault well no people she's working with in the fashion industry  i believe it's a lady gaga thing rubbing off is it a gaga thing this broad is looking up to the lady  gaga thing can you back up a little bit and get that line again oh so hateable i was just like 
[02:57:30]  wait a second wouldn't it be like amazing if i had a sewing machine to sew and make them actually fit me  properly so then i just asked for a sewing machine for my sixth birthday  so have you been taking sewing classes or did you kind of teach yourself um well i took like three  sewing classes but then i really didn't like my teacher she was like rude like she told me that 
[02:58:00]  some fabrics didn't match what i thought that they did and so i didn't go to her anymore so then i  basically just taught myself so what do you like designing the most dresses i love designing dresses  because they're so like amazing like every little girl should have a dress like then i don't think  they need yeah that's for sure yeah who are the designers that you look up to carl lagerfeld and 
[02:58:30]  diane von fristenberg i love them they are works of art can you do a little fashion spin for our  camera to check out that beautiful dress hot you are so cute i want you to design a dress for me  oh of course i will can you tell everyone your website yes so my website is ceceliacassini.com  if you can check out your designs yes you can buy my designs online or at fred siegel  fabulous darling thank you so much first of all she's 10 she's 10 and she acts like that so hateable 
[02:59:00]  three years she's gonna be hot yeah she's she's yeah you're not you're not lying no she actually  you could tell she's gonna be a good looking yeah there's gonna there's gonna have to be a lot of  weird changes there to make a problem i was gonna say and now i'm gonna say it you can tell she's  gonna be a good-looking tween a good-looking tween she's gonna be an attractive tween  what do you think of that is that is she so hateable though yeah that whole and wow wow 
[02:59:30]  she was red and she's got dresses already and fred siegel and stuff of course she's making a  shitload of money already yeah well what does she say about lady gaga i want one more clip oh she says  something about the gaga yeah there was a there was a video how she's uh she's talking about lady  talks about lady lady gaga well i like lady gaga is that the one yeah my designs are very fun and  colorful and avant-garde and um very outgoing um i get my inspiration from like everywhere i get it 
[03:00:00]  from paris and from new york i get it from like a patch of flowers or what somebody's wearing i just  get inspiration from everywhere i think that i've always wanted to be a passion designer and i think  i thought that we shouldn't wait till we're older i just think that we should just do it now so  she's rolling her eyes and i hope that other little girls on a red carpet um i just think that i listen 
[03:00:30]  to the customer of what they want and like a hooker i think that i'm different from other designers  because i'm so avant-garde now she's so avant-garde by the way like i dream of dressing lady gaga and  what i would make for her is something on a plastic sequins feathers about me faux fur and it's all  going to be matched together with a huge bow and i'm going to make her a huge puff um well this i got 
[03:01:00]  inspired by um new york fall fashion week and i love faux fur so this is why i thought that she  loves faux fur a blue faux fur well enough right so fucking annoying enough of you you're affected  little brat yeah yeah but god i hate children that are motivated i mean actually know what they want to  do with their lives at a young age yeah i think that's part of it isn't it annoying i think that's  part of why she's so hateable yeah why don't you go outside and fucking ride your stupid bike yeah

[03:04:00]  Yes, he will.  No.  I don't want to.  All right, it goes on and on.  We'll save you the rest of that.  Yeah.  It's approaching 700,000 views.  It's a newer video, too, so it'll do a few mil.  I don't get it.  You know, just because of...  It doesn't necessarily gauge something's worth.  I know, but it doesn't make sense.  A lot of people love dumb shit.  Yeah, but this one's not even good dumb.  I really don't get that.  The 10-year-old, that's just hateable.  That's totally hateable. 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  With her affectation.  Oh, she's going to destroy a few men in her life.  Oh, yeah.  She's going to get some divorce money.  She's going to be a looker, and people are going to fall into that, and they're going to be in hell.  And then, I think I want a divorce.  You're rude.  All right, you want to hear Rebecca Black at GMA?  Yeah, let's see what...  Because she's been gracious, I've heard.  She's gracious. 
[03:05:00]  She could take the low road and address the haters that way.  But she's gracious.  She's an internet sensation.  She will make millions now.  And she's going to do a mall tour for that Dumb Friday song.  Oh, she is really doing a mall tour?  I thought that was a rumor.  Unless Andy Levy just tweets bullshit.  Well, Andy Levy later then said, this might be a rumor.  He's checking into it.  Oh, okay.  He's affiliated with Fox News, so he could check.  Okay, so he's checking into it. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  Why would this work today?  Today?  Today.  Today.  All right.  Gotta catch my bus, and I'll see my friends.  Rebecca Black's song, Friday, is a hit all around the world.  It's Friday, Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday.  You must feel like you're in a dream right now.  I really do.  You know, fuck this.  Because something I haven't tweeted yet. 
[03:06:00]  Have you checked out?  Thank you, Brad.  You know what?  Fuck Brad.  I mean, fuck Brad in a good way.  Meaning, give him some fucking air time today.  Go ahead, Brad.  Hey, what's up?  I was going to do your call, but yes, I'm all in with this fucking video you're about to explain.  Uh, yeah, the fucking funny honey badger, bro.  Search that shit.  It'll make you laugh your ass off.  Have you seen this guy?  Funny honey badger?  He's an over-the-top gay guy that does, like, uh...  Yeah, it's that shit.  He commentaries like a honey badger or, like, it's actual search of a honey badger.  It's that first one. 
[03:06:30]  Never.  I've never heard of this.  This is creepy.  It's the honey badger.  Watch it run in slow motion.  It's pretty badass.  Look.  It runs all over the place.  Whoa, watch out, says that bird.  Ew, it's got a snake.  Oh, it's chasing a jackal.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, the honey badgers are just crazy.  The honey badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom.  It really doesn't give a shit.  If it's hungry, it's hungry.  Ew, what's that in its mouth? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, it's got a cobra.  Oh, it runs backwards.  Now, watch this.  Look, the snake's up in the tree.  Honey badger don't care.  Honey badger don't give a shit.  It just takes what it wants.  And every time it just, ew, and it eats snakes.  Oh, my God.  Watch it dig.  Look at that digging.  The honey badger is really pretty badass.  They have no regard for any other animal whatsoever.  Look, and it's just grunting and, ew, eating snakes.  Ew, what's that, a mouse?  Oh, that's nasty.  Oh, they're so nasty. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, look.  It's chasing things and eating them.  The honey badgers have a fairly long body.  Just watching a nature film.  Exactly, thick set, broad shoulders, and, you know, their skin is loose, allowing them  to move about freely, and they twist around.  Now, look, here's a house full of bees.  A house full of bees.  Think the honey badger cares?  It doesn't give a shit.  It goes right into the house of bees to get some larva.  How disgusting is that?  It eats larva.  Ew, that's so nasty.  But, look, the honey badger doesn't care. 
[03:08:00]  It's getting stung like a thousand times.  It doesn't give a shit.  It just, it's hungry.  It doesn't care about being stung by bees.  Nothing can stop the honey badger when it's hungry.  Oh, what a crazy fuck.  Look.  Ew, it's eating larva.  That's disgusting.  There it is, running in slow motion again.  See?  Now, what's interesting is that other animals, like these birds here, they just like to wait  around until the honey badger's done eating, and then it swoops in to pick up the scraps.  It says, you do all the work for us, honey badger, and we'll just eat whatever you find. 
[03:08:30]  How's that?  What do you say, stupid?  Look at this bird.  Thanks for the treat, stupid.  Hey, come back here, says the honey badger.  Birds don't care.  And you know what?  The jackals do it, too.  Look at these little dogs.  They're like, thanks, stupid.  Thanks for the mouse.  See you later.  The honey badger does all the work while these other animals just pick up the scraps.  At nighttime, the honey badger goes hunting because it's hungry.  Look.  Here comes a fierce battle between a king cobra and a honey badger.  I wonder what'll happen. 
[03:09:00]  Look at this.  There's the honey badger just eating a mouse.  And then, look.  Get away from me, says the snake.  Get away from me.  Honey badger don't care.  Honey badger smacks the shit out of it.  The snake comes back, and it lashes right at the honey badger.  Oh, little does the honey badger know, FYI.  It's been stung.  It's been bitten by the snake.  So while it's eating the snake, ew, that's disgusting.  Meanwhile, the poisonous venom is seeping through the honey badger's body, and it passes out.  Oh, my God.  Look at that sleepy fuck. 
[03:09:30]  Now, the honey badger's just going to pass out for a few minutes, and then it's going  to get right back up and start eating all over again because it's a hungry little bastard.  Look at this.  Like, nothing happened.  The honey badger gets right back up and continues eating the cobra.  How disgusting.  And, of course, what does the honey badger have to eat for the next three weeks?  Cobra.  The honey badger.  Now, holy shit, 3,300,000 views.  You think that, I don't know, you think it's a fake voice? 
[03:10:00]  You think it's a put-on?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't think it's a put-on.  I don't know.  But who gets the idea of just having a gay guy narrate nature footage like that?  He just doesn't give a shit.  I don't even know if there's more, but that thing made me fucking hell.  That is kind of funny.  It's horrible.  This lizard, you'll find out why in a second.  Oh, no.  Basilisks can be found in Costa Rica as well as throughout Central and South America rainforests, 
[03:10:30]  near rivers and streams.  Look, there's the father lizard doing some crazy head dance.  And there's mommy lizard.  Hi, mom.  I'm just a young little basilisk.  Now, basilisks generally eat insects, as well as berries and other small little fruits.  Okay, it's a put-on.  Whoops, looks like that snack got away.  Basilisks get their name from Basiliskus, the Greek mythological creature comprised of... 
[03:11:00]  It's not as good as Honey Badger.  No, Honey Badger is the best.  I don't know why, but Jesus.  He's trying to...  He's taking old fucking films, obviously, from National Geographic.  Yeah, old nature footage, and he narrates them in a very effeminate voice.  Yeah.  Very funny.  Uh, let me go to Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Uh, yeah, the reason all these things blow up, man, any internet meme, they all come from  our 4chan.  Like, anonymous, the dudes that attack Scientology.  Once they latch on to something, it just fucking exploded.  That's where, like, uh, you know, the Rick Rowling came from, the Sad Keanu, the LOL cats, 
[03:11:30]  all that shit starts on 4chan.  Like, a random board, and then it just explodes to the internet.  Once they latch on to something, it's a wrap.  So you gotta get on that board, Dan.  Yeah, that's where it all comes from, man.  If you look at all the comments on that video, you'll see, like, a lot of people saying anonymous  and, you know, random 4chan and shit like that, that's where it all comes from.  Oh, really?  Do you know about this 4chan?  No.  Do you, uh, Danny?  Yeah.  It's 4chan is, is, is the, that's like the real internet, you know what I mean? 
[03:12:00]  Like, where, where all these other viral websites, where, like, the guy's right, where all that  shit really originates from is typically 4chan, like all the memes or whatever you call them,  you know.  They call it, they call it the asshole of the internet.  That's basically what they call it, sir.  Or the mafia of the internet.  Cool.  So, yeah, everything ends up starting there before it branches out everywhere else.  So shit that's on 4chan, like a month ago, is just starting to, like, hit mainstream  shit now.  So who knows about this, like?  Everyone.  I don't know.  Like, what age group?  It's a mix.  There's a lot of weird shit that goes on on 4chan. 
[03:12:30]  Like, you remember the story about the, that lady, there was a video of some chick, she  drowned a whole bunch of puppies in a lake.  Oh, yeah.  Or some shit like that.  It was people on 4chan, like, hunted her down and found her.  You know, it's like, when you hear weird stories like that, it's, oh, it always boils  down to 4chan.  Who runs 4chan?  It's just, it's a board.  It's, you know, it's just, a board blew up.  There's actually one dude that runs that shit.  His name is Moot.  M-O-O-T.  He, he, he started it.  I can't vouch for you, sir.  I don't know Moot.  No, that's true.  Okay.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  I did not know that.  I learned something today. 
[03:13:00]  Let's say hi to Meredith in South Carolina.  Meredith.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was calling to let y'all know, my husband showed me, and I believe he found it on 4chan.  It's a guy that's shirtless with suspenders, and he just goes to different places and plays  his saxophone.  He plays the instrumental George Michael song.  Oh, yeah, I saw that.  It's not that great.  Thanks.  Thanks for calling, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah, not that great.  Oh, boy.  You got shot down by the internet, man.  It's funny.  It's, you know.  Yeah, he's the internet, man.  It's more to watch.  It's not, I mean, look. 
[03:13:30]  So, just because it's an internet video doesn't mean it's going to work so great on the radio.  On the radio.  Yeah.  Did you know Fez was doing those narrations for the nature vids?  I had no idea.  I better tell Ronnie B.  I think Fez is moonlighting on Ronnie B. Could be a problem.  That was, uh...  The honey badger.  Never heard of that.  He really enjoyed the honey badger.  I can't tell if I'm awake or not.  It's crazy.  When did you realize that things were really getting out of control?  After seeing it go from 4,000 views to 70,000 views in one night, and then waking up and 
[03:14:00]  it was at 200,000 views, that was when I realized this is going to be big.  But the song has become famous for all the wrong reasons.  Gotta jump, jump, gotta pet a cat.  Blueberries, strawberries, so many berries.  Rolling Stone called Friday an unintentional parody of modern pop, and the general public  has been even meaner.  I see my friend. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, they've been pretty mean to the poor gal.  Really?  She's taking a right to the bank.  Yeah.  I'm going to read you just some of the comments that people...  I love this.  Fucking GMA.  I love when they have to read the nasty comments, like she knows what they are.  But we would do the same thing, and just mock and laugh at her, but they do it in a  way like, no, we're just doing journalism.  We have to, you know, just to read these to you.  Right.  I hope you can handle it.  Yes.  You all right?  You want some tea or something before we do this?  We'd be right in her face. 
[03:15:00]  It's the same fucking thing.  Of course.  In the end.  I'm going to read you just some of the comments that people have been saying online, and they're  not nice.  No.  Her song Friday is the worst song I've ever heard in my entire life.  Even deaf people are complaining.  Okay.  It doesn't bother me.  I hate her voice.  It's going to be stuck in my head for life.  Friday, Friday, Friday, OMG.  I think that's an accomplishment.  You know, even a person that doesn't like it, it's going to be stuck in their head.  So that's the point of it. 
[03:15:30]  It's a catchy song.  Yeah.  What's the meanest thing you've read that maybe hurt you the most?  I hope you cut yourself, and I hope you get an eating disorder so you'll look pretty,  and I hope you go cut and die.  Have you cried?  That is the greatest.  An eating disorder so you'll look pretty.  Why isn't she laughing?  Oh, God damn.  That's, you just have to laugh at that.  And I hope you will cut and die.  Have you cried at all throughout all of this, or are you just strong? 
[03:16:00]  When I first saw all these nasty comments, I did cry.  I felt like this was my fault, and I shouldn't have done this, and this is all because of me.  And now I don't feel that way.  Hate is going to hate, yo.  Hate is going to hate.  The reporter talks to her mom and her producers.  That's her baby.  To read such hateful, hurtful things about her.  She doesn't have to read them.  You said them.  On the world stage.  In all honesty, I probably could have killed a few people, but that probably would get me nowhere. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, I mean, it makes you angry.  It makes you upset.  The song was produced by ARK Music Factory.  Their goal to turn the teen next door into a household name, with a little help from auto-tune voice technology.  How much did you change Rebecca's voice?  Actually, not a lot.  Was she off-key without the software?  She was actually in-key.  Her voice was actually really good. 
[03:17:00]  And finally...  Do you think you're a good singer?  I think I have talent on some level.  I don't think I'm the worst singer, but I don't think I'm the best singer.  Friday, Friday, kick me down on Friday.  Who would your dream duet be with?  I have Bieber fever.  I am in love with Justin Bieber.  Who doesn't?  That would just be...  Oh my gosh. 
[03:17:30]  Just thinking of it just gives me butterflies.  Yeah, where?  We thought we'd let her ask Justin directly.  Do you have a message for Justin?  Justin, if you're watching this right now, would you do a duet with me?  That would be unreal.  That would just make my life.  Would it make your life to do a duet with Justin Bieber?  He probably will do it.  Yeah, he probably will.  By the way, give me a few minutes and I'll tweet the Honey Badger for everybody. 
[03:18:00]  I've got to find it.  If his daddy, Usher, lets him do it, he'll do it.  Yeah, they'll do it.  They'll do the duet.  And then he'll be like, you know, kicking it up a notch.  That Friday, Friday thing.  Well, we have our own version.  Tomorrow we debut Club Soda Kenny doing Rebecca Black's Friday.  Unbelievable.  Hey, man, we've got to do this.  It's a bigger hit than hers.  It's going to get tens of views.  Uh, this is pie. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, well.  Let me say something.  Glenn in New Hampshire.  Glenn?  Gentlemen, how are you today?  All right.  What's up, Glenn?  Just as, uh, you'd be real right in this bitch's face just like you were when Whoopi Goldberg walked in the studio, right?  Yeah, that was a bad one.  We, uh, we, we, we cowered.  You're right.  Yeah.  That was fucking hilarious.  We do cower.  We do cower at times.  I know you're trying to, like, uh, you know, hit us between the eyes, but we're the first ones to admit sometimes we back way the fuck down. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, I just had to call you out on that.  It was funny.  I love to show you guys stuff.  Well, when they're not in here, we, uh, beat the shit out of them.  Yeah.  That's right.  We've had our moments, though, right in people's faces as well, sir.  Friday.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Whoopi certainly turned us that day.  It was.  Yeah.  That was, who surprised us?  Was that, uh, Eric Logan before he ran off to Oprah?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, well, I forgot, you know what, I forgot all about that until, uh, in the middle of this phone call, I remembered.  Yeah.  Because we've done a lot of radio, sir.  But that's right. 
[03:19:30]  We beat the shit out of Whoopi, and next thing you know, the door opens a couple days later, and she walks in, and we had no clue she was coming in that day.  Yep.  That was funny.  Actually, I knew.  I knew ahead of time, and then I led these guys on.  Now it's all coming back to me.  I see.  Pull the curtain back a little bit.  I don't know.  She, uh...  Yeah, a little bit.  Just, just a tad.  And then we, uh, we were cowards.  You're right.  We were cowards that day.  And she made some good points.  What are you gonna do?  But it made for some great radio. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, it was funny.  Yeah, she's awesome.  And we also, we were also cowards to, uh, Sarah Jessica Parker.  Oh, the horse face.  Yeah, we were cowards to her when she called in after we beat the shit out of her.  Yeah.  Didn't think anybody was listening.  Nah.  That's our problem.  We don't think anyone's listening at any given moment, and then we hear that they heard something  terrible about themselves, and then you gotta go like, eh.  Well, we, uh, we end today with the, uh, is this, uh, what kind of metal is this? 
[03:20:30]  Death metal.  A death metal version?  Of Friday by Rebecca Black.  This is how we end today.  A death metal honey badger.  Yes, the show continues with Sam.  He'll, he takes our scraps.  Oh, yeah.  And makes something of it.  What, what are we doing in the, uh, 10 o'clock hour?  Does anyone know?  Sam.  He's just wandering around.  Sam.  Look at him, yeah.  He doesn't know.  Sam!  He doesn't know any better.  Sam, what are we doing in the 10 o'clock hour, really quick?  Uh.  These guys gotta decide if they're going to the Pearl Jam channel or. 
[03:21:00]  No, you should stick around.  We gotta, uh, we're gonna go a little more in depth, of course, and Mara's pissing like  a bitch.  Okay.  Outtakes of Club Soda Kenny's recording session.  Of, oh, good.  Of today.  Just got done cutting it up.  That's something we should do within our show, though.  But we don't have time.  So we'll do it tomorrow as well.  I'm gonna give him a little taste, but not enough to spoil anything.  All right, good.  You see what I mean?  Just a little appetizer for tomorrow.  But we'll have the outtakes and, uh, the finished song by Club Soda Kenny tomorrow, right?  Hopefully, because we gotta add some auto-tune and stuff.  If we're gonna do this, we gotta make sure it's right, so hopefully.  All right, all right.  And, uh, yesterday we brought up Aunt's Mother-in-Law, so we might bring some people 
[03:21:30]  in to, uh, to an old Aunt's Mother-in-Law bit.  Oh, okay.  Those are fun.  Cool.  Okay.  Yeah.  We leave you with the death metal, uh, version of Rebecca Black's Friday.  See you guys tomorrow.  We'll be right back. 
[03:22:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.
