<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a protracted, sexually graphic monologue focused on anal sex.  The hosts then shifted to a discussion of the film *No Country for Old Men*, specifically praising a gas station scene and pondering the concept of a "death figure" in life.  They hyped an upcoming coin toss segment.

A "guess the sound" game followed, featuring listeners' often ludicrous guesses about a sound effect. A caller correctly identified the sound, prematurely ending the hosts' intended comedic bit.

Next, the "$10,000 homeless pyramid" game commenced, a crudely humorous variation of "$25,000 Pyramid" featuring homeless individuals and other unusual past show guests. Communication was poor, and the humor was based on the absurdity of the situation.

Clips from a Vince McMahon wrestling segment were played, showcasing highly profane and exaggerated interactions between McMahon and Hornswoggle, including a scene where McMahon orders Hornswoggle to "kiss his ass."  In-studio guest Christopher Titus was mentioned during this segment.

Andrew Dice Clay called in for a segment called "Quantum Dice," delivering rambling, offensive jokes referencing various historical events and tragedies.  The hosts commented on Dice Clay's perceived mental decline.

The show returned to a discussion of the film *Fatal Contact*, focusing on a graphically described autopsy scene related to the bird flu.

A "Name That Poon" segment followed, where the hosts and a caller attempted to identify celebrities in sex tapes using audio clues.  The segment involved graphic descriptions of the tapes' contents.  Winners were announced at the conclusion of the segment.

The final minutes included brief discussion of Fidel Castro's health, a listener's anecdote about their manager's dinner with Castro, and a lengthy story from Opie about a childhood baseball card incident involving a "greaser" kid.  Bob Kelly promoted his upcoming shows and CD before the broadcast ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the LB and Anthony Show.  But first, sexual pleasure. The buttocks and the anus.  Ooh. Not sure what year this is from, but the narrator reminds me, that would be Danny right in this, of Alan Funt, talking about the buttocks and the anus.  Buttocks are one of the major erogenous zones of women, and it is a known fact that man's greatest pleasure is in the natural parts of a woman.  And second only to the female breast, the buttocks are a visual turn-on. 
[00:00:30]  Not too many years ago, the buttocks were taboo as a sex object.  This is Don Kirshner for Don Kirshner's rock concert.  And now Casey and the Sunshine Band will play as I fondle his buttocks.  Now, with permissive sex attitudes, penetration from the rear, and anal lingus are considered perfectly normal.  Anal sexual practices play as much a part in heterosexual relationships as in homosexual ones. 
[00:01:00]  Many men, as well as women, are stimulated by the contemplation of the posterior.  They also like to include this part of the body in their sexual practices.  The buttocks, the anus, and the ridge between the actual sex organs, perineum, are among the most erogenous zones in both men and women.  In spite of this, anal eroticism is still subjected to many taboos.  However, with today's more permissive sexual attitudes, heterosexual anal intercourse is being more widely practiced by young people. 
[00:01:30]  Hmm. All right.  That guy, by the way, that guy talking, he's the worst person alive.  Why? This is a fantastic way to talk about anal lingus.  Ano lingus.  He's wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful.  I like to call it the car wash.  The prostate massage inside your asshole.  And the posterior.  And when she's rubbing the back of your leg, if her finger brushes where the shit comes out, it's going to be a sexual massage. 
[00:02:00]  Can you dig it? I knew that you could.  Tony, will you dance with me?  Tony, if she drapes you and her finger does not go near the posterior, you're probably going to be ripped off for $80.  But if her fingernail comes out and there's a little bit of shit underneath the nail, be prepared to hand over another $100.  Now let's view two girls, one cup.  This is one topping the charts this week. 
[00:02:30]  This is how the posterior is emptied before anal lingus or anal stimulation is noticed that her asshole opens like a dolphin's pee hole.  Let's talk about gaping.  Gaping.  Huge gaping assholes can be fun.  I said pee hole.  I suck.  A pee hole.  A porthole.  Whatever the fuck they call it.  Let's learn more.  You should know you have one.  I'm a sucker.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Chubsy! 
[00:03:00]  Opian Anthony.  Opian Anthony.  Opian Anthony.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  The Opian Anthony Show.  Last week.  Make sure you see No Country for Old Men.  I saw.  Saw that.  Anthony just saw.  Man.  Good, right?  That gas station scene could be in the top scenes of all of them.  That is really a good one.  Right up there with Pulp Fiction, Sam Jackson in the diner.  Yeah.  We're going to be doing that.  That is good.  That little discussion they have back in the long run. 
[00:03:30]  That's your lucky coin.  That guy's just crazy.  I love him.  Me and Gavin was watching it, and all I can think of, right, when I was watching that scene is you just go, I daydream about sometimes being the end of your life guy.  Just the guy that all you have to do is go, how's your day?  Excuse me?  Excuse me?  And you just go, oh, my God.  No, this is the end of my life guy.  This is the guy that's going to kill me.  I just said, how are you?  I was just minding my own business, and here it is.  I dream about being an end of your life guy. 
[00:04:00]  It's just, I dream of it.  I'd give up comedy to be that guy.  Yeah.  Just the end of your life guy.  No, sir, you can't come in here.  What?  What did you say?  Pardon?  Excuse me?  Yeah.  And then she realizes, like.  What's the most you ever lost in a coin toss?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, what am I going to win?  Everything.  Everything.  Everything.  You've been betting it your whole life and just didn't know it.  Here it is.  Oh, dude.  I just don't know.  There's the end of life guy.  Oh, wow.  Oh, he ticked me today. 
[00:04:30]  Damn.  Damn.  What time do you go to sleep?  You live in that house in the back?  You live in that house?  What if I come back and see you?  What?  Oh, damn.  I'm like, what?  I'm the end of your life guy.  What?  And then the fat lady in the office is like, he's not here.  Where's he at?  Where's Llewellyn?  Yeah.  He's not here.  And he looked like, you know, it's the end of your life.  End of your life guy.  End of your life guy.  I'm sorry, man.  What a great movie that is.  Yeah.  It really is.  That gas station scene is. 
[00:05:00]  The ending was, eh.  I didn't understand it.  Eh.  Yeah.  When those, that's.  They're trying to do that now in Hollywood.  They don't want the basic Hollywood ending anymore.  I don't get what.  We're going to be doing a coin toss thing on our show, by the way.  What are you going to do?  Life or death.  We're going to be doing a little coin toss thing on our show.  Should be anyway.  It's a little tease.  No.  Don't put it.  Don't put it in your pocket.  Yeah.  Don't put it in your pocket.  It's a lucky coin.  It's a lucky coin.  We're going to be playing.  We're going to be playing.  It's a bun pal talk.  Anthony, we're going to be playing. 
[00:05:30]  Should we stay or should we go?  Bang, Anthony.  Toss the coin.  Bring it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This week.  But first, we're going to do another guess the sound today.  We got this fine sound that just came in.  We're trying to figure out what this is.  Me looking at Super Tuesday results. 
[00:06:00]  No?  Bob Kelly in the fourth quarter of a Patriot.  So we got that.  Wow.  That's a.  Hmm.  They're usually not the obvious.  Like, it sounds like somebody being hacked apart.  Right.  But it's probably something silly.  It's someone videotaping something because I think the person laughing is videotaping.  Yes.  Hmm.  Oh.  Jimmy's correct.  Very good, Jimmy.  Jimmy's on to something there. 
[00:06:30]  You use your forensic expertise?  You could hear screaming and then all of a sudden, a laugh.  You shouldn't have heard laughter in the middle of screaming, Sam.  It obviously was the person with the camera.  Do you think it's some kind of.  Anthony's afraid that blackness is contagious.  It's not, Sam.  You're born with it or you're not.  Does it sound like that person was in some kind of distress, alive, dead? 
[00:07:00]  Do you think it was natural causes?  What did that sound like?  I don't know.  I can't tell because of the 80 decibel song coming to my head.  Sounds of one thing, E-Rock.  I'm going to be deaf and you're going to be accused of murder.  Gypsy.  I love Gypsy.  I can't get enough of Gypsy.  With his flat-ass girlfriend.  Yeah.  Turn the music louder.  They can't hear it, Sam.  Wild Clans, get your tiny genitals away from me, Sam. 
[00:07:30]  Stop with the magnifying glass underwear.  You're not fooling anyone.  Gypsy.  Gypsy's a five-line pony.  I love him, though.  Those five lines are gold.  We've got Steve in Boston.  He wants to play guest of sound.  Steve, go ahead.  Hi.  Is it that kid who runs the 200-meter screaming the entire way?  Steve, yeah, it is.  Is it?  Oh.  Thanks for ruining the bit. 
[00:08:00]  Good guess.  Steve, do you understand what this bit's about?  Hmm.  Sorry, gentlemen.  Would anyone care what the real answer is?  Not at all.  Isn't it fun to come up with, like, goofy answers?  Goofy answers about, uh, I don't know.  Isn't that the first time someone's guest, though?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Steve wrecked it for everybody.  See, all the phones are lit with silly answers.  Now we can't do silly answers because you decided everyone needed to know the right answer.  Thanks, Steve. 
[00:08:30]  Well, I'm a douche.  Enjoy your day.  Good.  You too.  Bye.  Look at that.  Somebody wanted to say a woman in a restroom.  Yeah.  Uh, standing in something that looks like spilled Jell-O.  Yeah, see?  We could have went with silly answers.  We don't give a crap what the real answer is when we do this bit.  Let me, let me just make sure I understand.  We're mad at that guy for giving the real answer when the bit is called, guess the sound.  And we're mad because he spoiled a miscarriage joke.  This is a repugnant radio show. 
[00:09:00]  We are awful.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Get infected.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're going to do something called the, uh, what, $10,000 homeless pyramid.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  It's going to be a homeless pyramid.  Right, right.  We're going to be playing.  And, uh, I guess the rules are very similar to the game that you're all so familiar with.  Right, right.  Uh, at home, the $25,000 pyramid hosted by Knickknock. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Uh, but only done with, uh, homeless people and, uh, the rest of the dregs of society we've  had on our program.  Why is Big A sitting on the homeless side?  First observation.  All right, Big A, go ahead.  Big A has to give the clues, and the cane's got to, uh, figure out what the word is.  Oh, I held my nose, and I just...  I listened, Santa Cain.  Shut up.  Is that you, Judah?  No.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Here we go.  All right.  Okay, um...  Wait, wait, what is the word? 
[00:10:00]  Well...  I don't know how do you play.  Uh, okay.  Uh, the word...  Things below the waist.  Oh, I got one.  Things below the waist.  Okay.  Thanks.  All right.  Um, um, um, um, kneecaps.  Ankles.  Things on time that are rotting.  No, you can't jump in.  Oh, I'm trying to...  It might have well been the answer, too.  Tired kneecaps.  Legs.  Legs.  Legs.  Legs, uh, uh, uh, uh... 
[00:10:30]  Well, at least they're below the waist.  Can I say...  I don't know.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I can't...  What can I say?  Uh, I think it's something a little bit more risque that's in the middle of my thighs.  That.  Does it begin with a V?  No?  No?  The V word?  Okay.  Uh, what are you trying to describe?  Eh!  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  The answer was things below the waist.  Oh.  Jesus.  No points for that team.  You...  Oh, this is going to take forever. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Tippi Tom.  Incredibly stupid.  Let's try to squeeze one more in before the break.  It's, uh, Tippi Tom and Twitchels.  Um, Tom will be giving the clues.  All right, Tom.  Tom will be giving the clues.  Does he know what he's, uh...  He's getting...  Writing it down right now.  Writing it down.  All right.  But we have to whisper it to everybody out there.  No, don't...  Don't say it.  Did he say it?  I knew he was going to do that.  Did he say it?  I'll say office.  An office.  Danny, what's the word?  Uh, give me something else. 
[00:11:30]  Office.  What?  Okay, you've used the word that's in the phrase.  Oh, my God.  All right.  He said office.  All right.  The phrase was, uh, things in a doctor's office.  And your first clue was an office.  No, you didn't.  All right, you're out.  You were saying orifice.  You were supposed to get doctor's office.  He was trying to say orifice.  You gave it away.  A good clue would have been...  I gave it a big clue.  You should have said stethoscope.  You should have said he's an alcohol.  All right, one more. 
[00:12:00]  We can squeeze one more in before the break, because that went so fast.  All right, yeah, Pop Rock is going to try to have Francine say what's on the paper.  All right, he's thinking.  All right, what is it?  Whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there in the radio.  Things on a plane.  You didn't hear that, did you, Francine?  Things on a plane.  All right, here we go.  Here's Pop Rock.  Go.  Stewardess. 
[00:12:30]  What?  Airplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute.  But it wasn't you.  He's giving the clues.  He's talking right to Pop Rock.  He's giving the clues.  I'll give you the clues.  Francine gets closed by saying a plane, not things on a plane.  She goes, I'm playing.  And then Pop Rock goes, things on a plane, like he won.  But he's the guy giving the clues. 
[00:13:00]  He's not even part of that team.  Good one.  Things on a plane.  Oh, Jesus.  What did you do?  You're not.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  Vince was getting his ass buffed professionally, and he had addressed the crowd of children in the audience 
[00:13:30]  and told the parents that the only way to really discipline the children and treat them is to have them kiss your ass as a parent.  Right.  And I gather now that his illegitimate son, what's his name?  Hornswoggle.  Hornswoggle.  Now will have to kiss Vince's ass as an example.  Is that what I'm led to believe?  Yeah, well, it's all about tough love.  Tough love. 
[00:14:00]  And if anyone could give tough love, it's Vince McMahon.  Is this a lesson to other parents?  It's a lesson, yeah, to both Hornswoggle and to other parents.  Hornswoggle.  And we're flattered because it's very obvious that Vince is now doing Angry Vince.  Angry Vince, Anthony's impression.  But he's Vince McMahon, so why would he do someone else's impression of himself?  I'm really confused.  I love this Vince.  He's just upped it a bit.  That's the ass buffer.  Look at him buffing his ass. 
[00:14:30]  He's a grown man.  All right, here we go.  Rules.  You know that your father loves you, right?  You know that this is going to hurt me more than it hurts you, right?  All right, let's get on with it.  No, no.  Let's get on with it.  Pardon the tan lines.  Come on.  I'll bend over for you.  How about that?  You don't even have to get on your knees.  Come on, kiss it. 
[00:15:00]  I don't have all night now.  Kiss my ass.  I said kiss it, you little bastard.  Jesus.  You little bastard.  Just hilarious.  Oh, God.  I love this Vince McMahon.  All right, kiss it.  Come on, Hornswaddle.  I don't have all night.  I'm your father, and I said kiss it.  And I mean kiss it right now. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, he's fighting.  Oh, there's no kissing.  He's fighting.  They're fighting.  They're fighting.  And they play the leprechaun music.  Wait, so he bit him, huh?  Hornswaddle bit him.  Look at Vince is just standing there.  Yeah.  And then finally this last clip.  I love the little bikini underpants.  Yeah.  Go buy the tan lines. 
[00:16:00]  They're the teeniest little thong underpants.  He's in his 60s, this guy.  He's got to be.  Here we go.  I suppose you all like that.  You like that, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's see if you like this.  Next week right here, Mr. McMahon's going to be in action.  That's who my opponent's going to be.  My son, bastard son, Hornswaddle.  I'm, because of you, because of each and every one of you, 
[00:16:30]  I'm going to beat the holy hell out of my son.  Oh, and by the way, Finley, if Finley gets involved in my match,  then it's all on you as well, because Finley, you'll be fine.  We just played that clip because we knew it ended like that  with the angry Vince Anthony impression.  Oh, that's great.  You'll be fine. 
[00:17:00]  Finley.  If you get involved in this match, you'll be fine.  God, that was hysterical.  Yeah.  You'll be fine.  Look at him.  He's walking around the ring.  He's biting his ass all the way around there.  With a leprechaun midget biting on his ass.  The virus is spreading.  And in studio, Christopher Titus. 
[00:17:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  But, Christopher, I've got to go back to the phone,  because Andrew Dice, Clay calling back.  Oh, God, not again.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, hey, hey, guys, how you doing?  What's up, Dice?  I'm very busy.  Baby Jessica's caught in the well, and I've got to help her get out.  People, we need to spread the word.  Those workers need sodas and water and hats.  Hey, baby Jessica.  Oh, wait a minute.  What's that?  Dice.  Yes.  Baby Jessica is now 32 years old. 
[00:18:00]  Well, then she better get out of there,  because it's probably getting very tight for her.  You're a little late on that one.  Oh, wait a minute.  Just like going down to Ground Zero.  Oh, my God, tragedy.  Yeah.  I've got to head over to the Dakota.  Not Dakota, because I hear one of the Beatles got shot.  Oh, it's a tragic day for everybody.  I've got to get over there.  But now I'm going from over here to over here now.  I'm over here in Bethlehem.  You'll be the only one outside the Dakota.  That happened a long time ago.  Yeah.  I mean, there'll be tourists out there, 
[00:18:30]  because they're there every effing day  taking pictures of the place, but...  I've got to go to Bethlehem.  You're going to Bethlehem?  Oh, my God, look at this poor guy up on a cross.  And they're nailing him up there.  Someone help the man.  Give him some water or something.  And then look at...  Oh, no, they're putting thorns on his head.  Just give him a hat.  You don't put thorns on their head.  You give him a police hat.  An NYPD hat.  NYPD.  Yeah.  Oh!  And, ladies and gentlemen, that was another episode of Quantum Dice. 
[00:19:00]  Hey, it's Quantum Dice.  Hey, Quantum Dice.  I'm Dr. Dice Beckett.  I go back in history.  I leap.  They call it leaping.  And I've got to fix mistakes in history.  So everything's okay now.  See, that's what I do.  I've got a happy face, a hologram that helps me out.  And sometimes I communicate with Club Soda Zinky. 
[00:19:30]  You know, a happy face hits the little light thing and says, I've got to help out here.  Some days I wake up.  I look in the mirror after I leap.  I'm a Negro.  And I'm like a ball player.  But sometimes I'm a chick with meat curtains.  And I go, oh, I got meat curtains.  And so once, I remember once I left, and I'm a goddamn retard.  I was a retard, but I was still diced.  But I look in the mirror, and I got a retard face. 
[00:20:00]  I go, I go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I Club Soda Ziggy.  I got a retard face.  But then, you know, the next day, I might be a midget.  And I hate the goddamn midgets.  Oh.  So I leap this one time, and I'm in the body of a chick, right?  And then the hell, happy face, the hologram, starts banging me.  Bop! Bop! 
[00:20:30]  His yambig slapping against my ass.  Oh!  Quantum Dice.  Next week, Dice is in the Nixon administration while Nixon's recording.  I hate the Jews, too, there, Tricky Dick.  I understand.  They're what you call shifty.  I understand.  We got to bomb the gooks in the nom.  And for sweeps, for sweeps, Dice in Saigon.  Hey, I can't believe I'm still in Saigon. 
[00:21:00]  How does this happen?  I got to take a boat up the Nung River?  I got to kill some guy.  Look, they napalmed the road.  This poor girl's running down it naked.  Someone help the poor girl.  I hear she's in Texas with a 97-year-old.  Oh, give her a hug.  All right, thank you, Dice.  I'm watching Quantum Dice.  Very nice.  That would be a great show.  Quantum Dice.  Quantum Dice. 
[00:21:30]  Anthony on fire today.  Oh, come on.  Man.  Hey, Mike, what's going on, bro?  Not to break from what I put on the screen, but I heard Dice was helping with the recovery  effort of the dinosaurs.  A huge tragedy.  The comedy is.  All right, Mike.  So how long has this been going on, man?  I mean, he's got...  Yeah, about four years.  We've been watching him slowly but surely to lose it.  I'm a comic, so I don't want to rip on a guy, but it seems like he's lost his mind.  It seems.  Well, no, but if comedy goes, most comics get on stage and they say, I remember this,  and then I was on my way to the show.  I mean, what just happened was real.  And like, I don't know about anybody else, but I had this grin on my face like I just  got stoned for the first time. 
[00:22:00]  I could not stop.  Because Anthony was doing exactly what we all wanted to be doing, just shut up.  I know.  He was fired up.  You should see he was bright red.  His head was bright red.  I know.  I'm spitting into the mic.  He's screaming into the mic, and I thought, man, and then all of a sudden, boom, the brilliant  comedy comes out of you.  You got to get him fired up so he has a vein sticking out in his head, and then all of  a sudden, beautiful.  So you go.  That's the key to get him fired up.  Man.  All right, bro.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There you go.  Plenty of fun.  Quantum Dice. 
[00:22:30]  That's fun.  That's fun.  Come on.  We're having fun today now.  It was really fun.  Well, now we can do an Alamo joke.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  We know that dice history, right?  Every time he calls now, you just do Quantum Dice.  Now we got to do Quantum Dice.  We just got caught.  You got a bit forever.  We can always go back to the Alamo.  There's plenty of history we can work on.  Dude, you went through a textbook already.  You were like, we went through the history of the world.  I know.  You did like the last 200 years with dice.  Yeah, hand me a pen.  I'll sign the Magna Carta.  Doesn't anyone have a pen?  They got to sign this thing. 
[00:23:00]  That's funny.  Got to take off?  I got to go, man.  I got to go get a sound check.  Oh, he's giving us the signs.  Anthony's giving us the signs.  Well, I'm sorry.  You guys spent so much time talking about my act, and I'm going to go to the  How Funny I Was.  We've beaten it.  Look, I will tell you.  Answer it last time.  I saw Christopher last time.  It was very funny.  And it's not just you run in the middle, you know, going there and see a comic.  It's very funny stuff.  Intense stuff.  It's an amazing chain of events you go through that I brought to you where you are now, and 
[00:23:30]  it's really funny.  We got a standing ovation that you were there.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  They were leaving.  Whatever it was.  Yeah, but they were standing.  I saw they were standing.  They didn't just stand up and go.  They stood up and clapped for a minute, and then they laughed.  Then they laughed.  That's how good it was.  Guys, appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  I will see you later.  Good luck with the Fox thing, too.  All right, man.  I feel much better on my career.  Yeah, goddamn puppets.  Hearing Dice, I feel a lot better about my career.  Well, you should.  Thanks, guys.  Talk to you.  All right.  Take it easy, Christopher.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:24:00]  Let's get back to the bird flu movie from last night.  Fatal Contact.  Bird flu in America.  How are these?  This next clip, what happens to body?  Yeah, they're doing the autopsy on Team Connolly.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Team Connolly.  Not all patients with H5 get ARDS.  For those that do, at least 40 to 60% of them will die.  An hour prior to his death, he complained of body aches so intense he thought his bones 
[00:24:30]  were breaking.  Uh-oh.  I think I got that.  He thought so violently that he tore apart his abdominal muscles and his rib cordilage.  Basically, he drowned in his own blood.  What kind of – is that the woman doing the autopsy or a doctor or something?  Why does she sound so –  She has the most wooden delivery for the entire movie.  She's docked him healthy with a scalpel.  I love the squishy sound effects in the background.  And he ripped apart his abdominal – 
[00:25:00]  He ripped apart his abdominal muscles.  And he drowned in his own blood.  And then he threw me out of the car.  He said I had the sniffles.  I said I didn't.  Karen, where's the medicine?  They were going to find it, Henry.  They were, and we need that, Robitussin for the bird flu.  They were going to find it. 
[00:25:30]  Janice Rossi has the bird flu.  Janice Rossi has the bird flu in your apartment.  There's a pigeon living in your building.  Get your own, Connelly.  When he said the body count, most people would have been horrified.  I have to admit, it kind of turned me on.  What type of people are these sneezing and coughing with pelicans? 
[00:26:00]  Never not a moment for a Goodfellas reference.  It's always – here's the rule of thumb for Goodfellas references.  Always appropriate.  O.P. and Anthony.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  All right, name that poon.  Let's go there, Tony.  Don't let Anthony compliment you on the air.  It's degrading to the host. 
[00:26:30]  Yes, sir.  Sorry to interrupt.  Okay.  Yeah, so you guys are going to alternate bidding on how few seconds you guys are going to need  to identify the celebrity who's getting banged, as in I can name that poon in three seconds.  Oh, like name that toon.  But it says only – yes, it's poon, which is slang for pussy.  I get it now.  All right.  Nice.  How about we just play, like – how long is each track?  I think the longest one is a minute and a half. 
[00:27:00]  Two, but that doesn't go by the rules of name that poon.  He was fairly insistent on going by the right – you got to go, like, I could name that  poon in – and then a certain amount of seconds, I guess.  And then the person goes, what, dot, dot, dot, name that poon.  All right.  I'll – I can name that poon in zero seconds.  Oh, you want to hear the clue?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, the clue.  There's a clue.  Zero seconds.  You're ruining the game.  Zero seconds.  All right.  There's only four sex tapes out there.  I'm going to take a shot here. 
[00:27:30]  I'm going to go with Pam Anderson as my first answer.  No, don't ruin it.  You're ruining the game.  My second answer is going to be Paris Hilton.  My third will be Kim Kardashian.  And my fourth guest –  Amy Fisher.  Amy Fisher.  And fifth is China.  And fifth is China.  There you go.  All right.  Name that poon.  Okay.  All right.  Let's just go clockwise here.  I'll read the first clue, and then you start –  Clockwise.  And you start the bidding.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Once gracing the pages of Playboy, this annoying bitch rose to fame in the early 90s.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:28:00]  I cannot – I can name that poon in zero seconds.  I don't know.  I got more.  Okay, good.  This is tough.  Oh, my God.  Fortunately for us all, the only thing that fell faster than her career was her pushy husband  in order to fuck her doggy style in this video.  Okay.  Now, let the bidding start at one minute and 30 seconds.  I will name that poon in 30 seconds.  Anthony, name that poon.  One second. 
[00:28:30]  All right.  So he has to name it because one second, there's no more.  Jim, name that poon.  All right.  Cam Anderson.  Hold on.  I got to play the clip.  I got to play the clip.  Go ahead.  I'm trying to stick with the game.  Go ahead.  Okay, now I'm going to get to show this.  Pam Anderson.  And it is indeed – you are indeed wrong, sir.  You are wrong.  You are wrong.  Now –  Say, smartasses.  You'll play the rest of the clip, and I guess whoever just says it first wins, I guess. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, all right.  Hands on buzzers.  Hands on buzzers.  Dakota Fanning.  So you can study it.  Move your camera.  Just move your hands.  Don't even – put your hands on your spine.  Baby, no.  My scar is on there.  Take my off to see the scars and see the difference.  Here, this is the scars.  Guide your fucking mouth.  Take the bra off.  Now.  Drop the panties.  Just let him go.  You are – you've been – you're going to freak me. 
[00:29:30]  See this?  Oh, God.  I'm turning off force.  Peter is sticking out.  I got it.  Dorothy Stratton, right before he shot her.  All right.  I guess nobody got that one.  No.  Tough one.  Gina Lee Nolan.  Yeah, but we didn't hear the fucking part.  Well, it's –  Well, he was flipping around.  Hold on.  We got to at least –  Gina Lee Nolan?  Got to get something out of this bitch.  Bitch is that?  No one knows who she is.  Nobody's going off force.  All right. 
[00:30:00]  Hold on.  Doggy.  Go doggy.  Oh, my God.  I'm really bad.  Stop you bitching.  Okay, prick face.  God, you know.  Selfish one.  I'm in pain.  See the ass.  Smile for daddy.  Move towards that wall.  Daddy.  Stop.  That's great.  Stop.  Face the camera.  Perfectly framed.  Put your hands forward.  Stop.  I don't feel comfortable here.  Baby, you're going to hurt me. 
[00:30:30]  You need to tell us in front of you.  Ow.  You're hurting me.  Like every minute you're doing that.  I mean, I can't believe what you're fucking doing.  Creep.  I'm in pain.  Is that – do you care?  No.  I am.  I'm in pain.  Who's fucking –  It's my bra.  It's hurting.  It's an old dude.  What?  I think it's her husband that she divorced a while ago.  She just had tit implants.  That's what she was complaining about when he was fucking her.  They were bouncing around.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What's that? 
[00:31:00]  What year is that?  93.  93?  94?  Cool.  Like so.  I just guessed.  All right.  All Sam's keeping track.  So I get a point for that.  How?  You didn't guess it.  What?  You didn't guess it.  Yeah, I said Gina Lynn.  Okay.  That's a point.  Gina Lee Nolan?  What?  Nolan?  That's it, Sam.  Who is she, by the way?  Thank you.  She was on Baywatch.  She was on Playboy.  All right.  That describes everybody that's made a sex tape or a drunk tape. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Here's the second clue.  Oh, we'll start with you, the bidding, after I'm done.  This multi-talented gash made her fame through sports, music, and reality TV.  Even though she has not succeeded in any of these, she certainly succeeds in making your  dick limp in this video.  I could name that poon in half a second.  All right.  Well, it's 1-0-2.  You want to go with the one second?  One or two?  No, 1-0-2 is where you start at.  One minute and two seconds.  Oh, I'm going to go with one second.  One second. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Then take a shot.  I had to go ahead.  All right.  You'll stop it after a second?  Yes.  One second?  That's ridiculous.  One night in China.  Bang!  Give it one for the boss.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  And I even cut out the obvious part of that fucking...  Which was what?  Cock or wrestling?  What obvious part?  I heard silence in my one second.  Yeah.  You heard nothing.  No, no, no.  I mean out of my clue. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Now we get to hear her get banged.  Okay.  Looks good.  Does that feel comfortable?  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I don't know what you're going to do.  Ugh.  You want to hold that?  Yeah.  Oh, that looks so hot.  That's an awful cock. 
[00:33:00]  That's an awful cock.  That clip was nice.  No.  It looks like a fleshy dunce cat.  It looks fucking juicy.  It's a meat pack.  I'm going to leave the faucet running?  What is she watching out there?  What up, baby?  What is she watching out there? 
[00:33:30]  How long is this clip?  No.  One minute.  Oh, it's kind of big right there.  Man, let's go.  Why wouldn't you get like the real crazy like screaming?  There really wasn't that much in that video.  She was like terrible.  All right, Tony.  All right.  Clue three.  Jimmy, this one will be for you.  All right.  I'm done.  They say money can't buy you happiness.  And apparently it can't buy you dick-sucking skills either.  This slit shows us why sometimes it's just better to go home and jerk off.  Start the bidding at one minute and 49 seconds. 
[00:34:00]  Ten seconds.  Really?  It's a mess.  Five seconds.  Wait, can you guys say, can you guys say, I can name the poon?  I can name that poon.  Thank God, you OCD freak.  I can name that poon in five seconds.  I can name that poon in two seconds.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to turn.  But I already said it.  No, you said ten.  He said five.  Now Oaks got to be five.  I know, but I didn't say I named that poon. 
[00:34:30]  So I said it the way you wanted me to.  Oh, nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  I got five seconds.  I apologize for yelling at you.  Five seconds.  Out of turn.  But you said ten.  I know.  No, I didn't.  You can't change it.  I said five.  Wait, hold on.  You know, you're a good host.  You should be like Ray Combs.  Someone find this kid a closet.  I can name that poon in ten seconds.  All right.  I can name that poon in five seconds.  I can't name that poon.  You got to tell him to name it. 
[00:35:00]  Why?  You got to play it.  Because if you don't think you can beat it, you say name that poon.  What about Jimmy, though?  Yeah.  He doesn't go back to Jimmy?  Yeah.  He goes back to Jimmy.  Oh, so what do you need me to say?  You don't want to guess lower than five.  You tell him to name the poon.  Name that poon.  I can name that poon in four seconds.  Ooh.  Jimmy?  Go ahead and name it.  Me?  Now it's to me.  Can I hear the clue one more time, sir?  Sure.  They say money can't buy you happiness, and apparently it can't buy you dick-sucking skills 
[00:35:30]  either.  This slit shows us all why sometimes it's better to just go home and jerk off.  So she didn't suck the cock good.  That's your clue in there.  All right.  Okay.  Well, I could name that poon in one second.  Wow.  Let him have it.  Yeah, his first clue was too obvious.  Go ahead.  All right.  Ready?  Turn off the Tony music.  Yep.  Yep.  I hear it.  That poon is Paris Hilton.  We got a tie.

[00:48:00]  you have two jobs in this show to go and to hit a few buttons that's your gig  see that's easy that's all you have to do on a daily basis is push buttons and go  so if someone says montage  oh god i want to start like slowly getting mad at him for doing it now like but slowly phase it in 
[00:48:30]  so he's very confused as to what to do can we work uh the word montage into the show about a hundred  times today see so every time we say montage we want uh eric to say montage because that's his gig  that and pushing buttons i think you'll be doing it like about something really serious where you  don't want it and the dummy will just chime in you'll throw your hot coffee on him  cup and all god on tv they're showing a montage of missing children 
[00:49:00]  oh i don't think that was very appropriate yeah you rock what the hell you gotta know when to use  the montage thing anyway they were showing yeah exactly they were showing a montage  of uh fidel castro on tv the young tough scary fidel castro always in his uh uniform and  and like uh the observation you made today now he's in an old person's track suit he's in the  track suit like the old folks wear where they got the walker with the tennis balls on the front of 
[00:49:30]  him and he's he's look he's trying to look like he's in shape so he's doing some kind of jogging  move with his hands but his feet are just barely shuffling on the floor and he's gotta weigh 90  pounds uh when he was really sick remember when they said he was on death's door a few months ago  he was the picture of health compared to what he is now yeah he's lost even more weight he's got a  little mohawk thing going because his hair is like falling out his beard just oh just mangy i don't know 
[00:50:00]  what happened there it's really really not looking good this beard looks like your 18 year old dog  just all mangy and unkempt yeah but uh we bring up fidel castro because jimmy's got a story  someone he knows this is one of the most amazing things ever oh it's tragic it's too much pressure  now now it's oh no amazing no well a barrel through him he flew to cuba without a plane no we know this  guy that gets to go to cuba and he uh he had food lunch or dinner with fidel castro a few times 
[00:50:30]  my manager um went to cuba a few times and um he knows people that know fidel and he took a bunch of  people to dinner and uh he actually got to introduce them all to fidel and uh pretty impressive  very impressive yeah my manager's a weird guy he goes to africa by himself he's a creepy arms dealer  i know that and he uh actually fidel gave him no we got to get into the johnson stories one day  yeah he shows us pictures where he's in like nigeria or west africa one of the scary parts of 
[00:51:00]  africa i don't i don't know uh does he hunt huh no no he doesn't big game hunt he just goes to  africa that's like people that go to thailand or or uh cambodia you know they're going there to  have sex with uh youngsters that's like that area of the world if you're going to africa and you have  no is is he a white guy yes yeah all right if you're a white guy and you're going to africa  you're selling guns to various factions so they got pictures of him exactly pictures of him on the  side of the road as they're bringing the you know a parade of the new king in the background 
[00:51:30]  yeah kind of like if you've seen last king of scotland you know it's it's the area is not stable  whatsoever and there he is on on vacation as they're bringing the new west african what have  you leader through oh he's in it and everyone around him has guns it's you know that type of scene  and then he he went to timbuktu and uh just goes it really a place yes he he goes to all these  strange places and it's like you're nuts he's zealic my manager is zealic wow he just shows up in 
[00:52:00]  these odd places and nothing happens to him that's that's cool he had a he had a meeting with  fidel castro they had a dinner and fidel did something which he really didn't do anymore he  signed a box of cigars it was sodomy rarely do this anymore but i like you for old times sake  but he he gave jonathan uh a box of cigars cuban cigars and he signed the box or the probably the box 
[00:52:30]  right a signed box of cuban cigars and i was fidel castro especially after he died  completely priceless i was gonna say one of the most amazing things you could collect as as a  collector i can't think of other things you could actually get and um he was storing them in my  other manager david's uh uh cigar humidor humidor in his office in los angeles david on the road would  have his assistant send him some cigars and he'd say i need some cigars for a meeting tonight could you  send me some and his assistant would run and go to the humidor not touch the jonathan box most times 
[00:53:00]  um but one time she oh no yeah open the box and and does he still have the signed box at least  see that would be a good thing but she didn't know it was a signed castro box so after she sent the  cigars out she threw the box oh my threw the box away imagine threw a signed castro box of cigars  that's hey you get another one there's collectors out there crying right now it's gotta be easy well  jimmy's you know a collector of all those you know that type of stuff that would that just drive you 
[00:53:30]  nuts it it my manager told me at the uh at comic relief and and i could see it affects him i can't  even tease him about you never get over something no he just blinks harder it just it affects him  badly like there's something that kind of life-changing for him so uh where was her body placed  you can't even mention it to her you gotta just put her in a 55 gallon drum and throw it into the  ocean i uh i collected baseball cards growing up and uh i had a don larson card of the year he  picked uh pitched the perfect game in the world series so this card was worth a lot of money 
[00:54:00]  it was like from the whatever what the 50s whatever and i brought it to school for like  kind of show and tell and it was one of these cards that i just i would not depart i would just  keep it at home in a box in plastic it was one of those things and i brought it in to show  everyone to kind of brag like very what i got out show and tell and there was just just this like  greaser just this kid that had long hair before anyone else had long hair and he was wearing the  leather jackets he's sitting next to me he goes oh let me see that card i'm i'm stupid like oh this
