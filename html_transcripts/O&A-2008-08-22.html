<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie describing his physical therapy, highlighting his atrophied buttock, and his subsequent urgent need for a restroom break at Starbucks, recounted with humorous detail.  This transitioned into a discussion of their personal ailments and a story about Opie's father's mosquito-repelling misadventure with a citronella candle (a caller later corrected their usage).  The hosts then shifted to the Yankees' poor performance compared to the Mets' success, followed by a discussion of a planned rematch between Kimbo Slice and a Boston cop from a viral video.  Caller opinions on both topics were solicited. Opie provided a lukewarm review of the movie "Traitor," starring Don Cheadle. This led to a discussion about Long Island magician Bob Infantino's arrest for secretly videotaping children undressing, prompting speculation about predatory behavior in professions involving children, including gynecologists, gym teachers, and magicians. The segment concluded with Olympics discussion, covering BMX cycling, the women's soccer team's win, potential Chinese gymnast age falsification, a comparison of men's and women's beach volleyball popularity, and suggestions for new Olympic sports (chess and strongman competitions). A caller’s name was mistakenly recorded as “Donna” instead of “Dennis.”


The show then moved to speculation surrounding Barack Obama's VP choice, with humorous conjecture about his announcement method (text message) and potential candidates like Kathleen Sebelius, Cain, and Biden, including commentary on the political ramifications of a female VP. A Florida caller briefly discussed a hurricane. The focus then shifted to the K-Rock girl selection process, contrasting past overtly sexualized segments with current station restrictions. The hosts recounted past outrageous stunts, including a couple having sex on a new carpet and forcing an employee to wear a “chin dildo.”  This selection involved 17 finalists, and a significant portion was dedicated to a crude game attempting to determine which girls were menstruating, involving increasingly absurd methods such as a “white couch test” and Pat Duffy's attempts at olfactory detection.  Vinny Brand from the Stress Factory participated, offering commentary and unintentionally revealing details about his daughter's attractiveness. The selection used PalTalk cameras for a live online feed. QuickCheck was thanked for providing Italian subs.  The segment ended with a discussion of a baby whale attempting to suckle on a yacht and its subsequent euthanasia.


The next segment featured the K-Rock girl contest judged by Opie, Anthony, and Vinny Brand.  Contestants, identified by initials, were assessed based on physical attributes and personality, with crude and sexually explicit commentary.  Pat Duffy attempted (unsuccessfully) to determine menstruation by smell.  Ron, a staff member, also tried but was rebuffed.  The hosts criticized the contestants' photos, blaming the photographer. Several contestants had tattoos and discussed their meanings.  Vinny Brand also promoted his upcoming stand-up gig.  The segment ended with a break before the contest's conclusion.


This continued the K-Rock girl contest, with Opie, Anthony, and Vinny Brand providing sexually suggestive and crude commentary on the contestants' appearances, tattoos, body types, and sexual preferences. Contestants described their tattoos and sexual orientations; one contestant's purple hair led to discussion of her relationship with her father, and another's description of being both submissive and dominant sparked discussion about BDSM. One contestant spanked Duffy.  Mara, the station's General Manager, made a surprise appearance, causing disruption and humorous comments.  The selection process was chaotic, with arguments and disagreements. The segment concluded with the selection of the final K-Rock girls, accompanied by further sexually charged commentary.


The final segment began with discussions of failed marriages and the hosts' and caller Travis’ subsequent dating lives. Travis detailed his ex-wife abandoning their children, and the conversation became increasingly vulgar and sexually explicit.  Caller Keith attempted to get his brother Dan on the air, leading to a chaotic segment involving studio logistics and arguments about workflow and a building manager.  Dan and his girlfriend were brought in, and the conversation quickly became explicit, focusing on their sex life and the girlfriend's physical attributes.  The focus then shifted to a graphic discussion of a video of Pat Duffy performing oral sex.  This led to a detailed description of their violent sexual encounters, including slapping, biting, and the girlfriend's enjoyment of being hurt.  The segment culminated with the couple engaging in consensual on-air physical acts (slapping and anal fingering), described and witnessed by the hosts and the audience, using frequent crude and offensive language.


The show concluded with a segment featuring a woman repeatedly kicking Pat Duffy in the testicles. The hosts and the woman engaged in sexually explicit discussion of the act, describing it in detail and commenting on Pat's reactions and apparent enjoyment.  Various sexual acts were described, including "the rusty trombone," period sex, and cock and ball torture.  Movies (Platoon, The Shining, and The Caine Mutiny) were also mentioned, along with a brief mention of the show’s line of the day segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Shoe.  Hi.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Opie.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hi, Jim.  Hi.  I just figured we'd get that in. 
[00:00:30]  Well, Friday edition.  I want to say, well, yeah, speaking of Friday, I want to start with some FUs.  Because it's FU Friday, right, Ant?  Yes, it is.  I want to send a huge FU out to my physical therapy trainers.  Ooh.  Yes.  What did they do?  Well, they decided while they were stretching me yesterday.  Yeah, I went in for a bad wing.  And I'm getting that fixed, right?  Yeah.  But I'm getting like a full body, like, uh, uh, uh, uh, what's the, what's the thing when 
[00:01:00]  you look and you go, wow, you need this and that and this and do a few of these.  And I don't know.  Like, uh, like an overhaul, basically, I guess.  It sounds like the sisters in Shawshank.  What are you?  Yeah.  But, uh, they decided that they were comfortable enough with me to start pointing out all my  flaws on, on my body.  Oh.  And then they made me stand up and the girl, which makes it even worse, points to my butt 
[00:01:30]  and goes to, uh, uh, uh, I always forget his name.  See, I can't even talk.  Saeed.  Saeed.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yes.  You were listening yesterday.  Of course.  Who used to be the ex, uh, Knicks trainer.  He goes, look, Saeed.  He has no butt.  Ooh.  Look, the right one is atrophied.  Atrophied.  And then they start laughing.  They're like, this is kind of like being in a sorority where we get to point out what's  wrong with your body.  And I'm like, yeah, that's really funny. 
[00:02:00]  And they're laughing to each other.  And I'm like, well, payback's going to be a bitch because I'm going to start talking about  your flaws on my radio show in front of a million people.  Ooh.  Well, that sounds like, that didn't sound very, um.  They told me I had to work on my.  Constructive.  They told me I had to work on my ass.  Atrophied.  Well, yeah, atrophied means the muscles haven't been, you know, need to, uh, you  know, start, I don't know.  Well, I got to tell you something.  You, uh.  They're weak muscles.  Whenever we've talked about working out or something, you have always said you never 
[00:02:30]  work out your legs.  Right.  Perhaps there was a.  Well, because I used to be a runner and running would just, you know, give you a nice ease.  But now that I bike.  See, because a lot of people think I still like, uh, rollerblade and stuff.  I really can't because I also I'm dealing with like a lower back issue.  Boy.  Yeah, I know.  No kidding.  It's like wear and tear injuries all over my body.  That's why I'm going to this place to kind of like have them rebuild me.  Yeah.  And actually I feel a lot better. 
[00:03:00]  But when one of my butt muscles is atrophied.  How can one be?  Because I've been.  Walking in circles a lot.  Because I've been favoring this, this side of my butt because of my lower back problem.  Oh.  But I didn't need it pointed out to me yesterday.  Like walking or, or what, how have you been favoring one half of your butt?  You just kind of like, I don't know, you push off on your left a little more, I guess.  It's almost like, um, uh, I don't know if you had a broken leg or something.  Yeah.  You know how you sort of favor it, but you use it kind of. 
[00:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  You know, that's the exaggerated version, I guess.  Do that long enough and I guess, uh.  Yeah.  But they said no.  One cheek looks less than the other.  Yeah.  Looks like a Bell's palsy.  Yeah.  But they said I could, uh, they could rebuild my, uh, my, my right butt.  Can rebuild it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's what my butt looks like if you want to put it up on a radio.com.  That's pretty much an atrophied butt.  It looks like Eastside Dave's, uh.  Yeah.  Butt.  And then, then she's like, uh, then she goes, lift up your shirt.  And I'm like, well, I, I gotta say ahead of time, I'm bloated today. 
[00:04:00]  You had, you had to tell people you were bloated?  Yes.  Because I didn't want them to point out that I might need to work on my, uh, my abs.  Mm-hmm.  I'm like, do you see what you're, what you're seeing right now is because I'm bloated.  Yeah.  Because I've been eating too many vegetables and according to my stupid doctor, you know,  that, that, uh, they don't, they don't digest quickly enough and it, and it produces gas  and that will bloat you.  Mm-hmm.  So I'm a mess.  So they were ready for it?  Oh, well, they were ready to make fun of my, my bloatations. 
[00:04:30]  And saying, I might need to do a few crunches.  And I'm like, no, this is just a temporary thing.  Wait, did you tell the, the workout people that like, I might have like a little bit of  a gut because I ate too many veggies.  Too many veggies.  I ate too many veggies.  So, so I got an atrophied butt muscle and other problems with my body that they had to  point out.  And look, look at his lower back.  It's flat.  Well, like, gee, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  And then I was walking home and I'll prove that I was bloated because I was having a 
[00:05:00]  nice, like a nice lovey dovey, like, um, like, uh, I am chat with my, my girl and we  were chatting about this and that and blah, blah, blah.  I love you.  I love all that crap.  Right.  And then all of a sudden she goes, what are you doing now?  And at that moment I was in Starbucks taking care of my blotation.  Penny for your thoughts.  Right.  And let's just say the Starbucks, uh, bathroom got a, got a workout. 
[00:05:30]  Oh yeah.  To the point people started knocking on the door.  That's not good.  No.  So then they know that there's a shenanigans going on in there above and beyond.  I could say this.  It turned out to be snakes in a can.  My friend snakes in a can.  Oh no.  You ever play with those kids, uh, toys?  Maybe someone out there knows it.  Can.  No.  Well, the snake can is good, but then they got these little things like, um, Oh, you light  them.  What? 
[00:06:00]  No, you know, the stuff you throw in water and all of a sudden it goes, it becomes huge.  Oh, the little sponges.  Yeah.  But they start out as tiny, tiny, tiny little sponges.  I think you can get them at Urban Outfitters, I believe.  I think I've seen them in there where you could grow your own Jesus, right?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  See?  Grow your own Jesus.  Yeah.  They say grow your own Jesus and it's a tiny little Jesus thing.  It's like a spongy thing and you throw in your bathtub and next thing you know, Jesus  is like three feet from this, from like an inch to three feet.  It's like a miracle.  Yeah.  Well, that's what was going on in Starbucks yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  Very impressed.  Very impressed with that.  And it took care of my, uh, my bloatation there, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  Bloated, atrophied butt.  A herniated disc and a bad wing.  Bad, uh, arm and a...  Welcome to my thirties.  Wow.  My thirties.  Yep.  Again?  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Uh.  Yeah.  I was bitching about my age, uh, the other day and Jimmy goes, how did you, how did you 
[00:07:00]  get younger than me even?  I don't know.  I don't know what you're doing, but that's my age.  I'd hate to sit there and be critiqued.  No kidding.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And she's six months pregnant.  She's a looker.  She's six months pregnant and she's, and she's like pointing out my flaws.  I'm like, gee, thanks.  Pointing out hers.  Tells she's probably got hemorrhoids.  All these pregnant women always bitching about their roids.  But, but they finally got comfortable, comfortable with me because I've been going for about 
[00:07:30]  three weeks and they're like, this is like a sorority where we get to point out flaws.  Yeah.  Only I'm the one they're pointing at.  Right.  This isn't fun.  No.  Uh, but I will be rebuilt slowly, but surely.  But then the first thing you say to me this morning is, dude, you got to get a trainer and  then you poke your stomach and you go, ow, I can't even, all he tells me is how sore he  is.  Yeah.  Humiliated him.  Humiliated, sore.  Well, I, uh, I, I, I've been known to like, you know, work out and try to, you know, stay 
[00:08:00]  in pretty good shape.  And I told Jimmy, I'm like, what have I been doing in the gym all these years?  Cause like, they're doing stuff where I'm like, what, like leaving with completely soaked  and stuff.  I'm like, I was just wasting time in the gym over these last few years, just wasting  time compared to what they're doing.  I'm like, oh man, I'm, I'm doing drive the bus.  I'm doing supermans.  I'm doing all sorts.  Drive the bus and supermans. 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  What is a superman?  I can't even tell you.  That has to be, and does it involve a ball?  It, it, yeah.  And do you lay on it on your belly like superman and, and go like with your arms straight out  and go.  Well, it's, first of all, it's a, it's one of those half balls.  Oh, so it's a dome, a dome thing.  And then you like get your belly on there and then you, and then you lift your arms and  your legs up at the same time and you yell superman.  But you don't yell superman. 
[00:09:00]  I hope not.  No, but.  Better than what I thought.  They put you up on a sawhorse of some sort and then just kicked you off it.  But I will be rebuilt.  It's about time.  And the, um, all right, the superman and what's the other one?  Well, drive the buses.  Drive the bus.  You hold the ball with the handles on the side and you just kind of go back and forth  like you're driving the bus.  It's, it's, it's more like erratically driving the bus because you're kind of. 
[00:09:30]  Oh yeah.  Just steering back and forth.  Well, you got to make believe you're like, uh, you know, steering a plane in Madrid.  You just do a lot of quick lefts and then quick rights, quick left, quick right, quick  left, quick right.  Yeah.  And you got to do it on a crunchy ball.  So enough about me.  How are you guys?  I hope he is doing kindergarten exercises.  Yeah.  Uh, they want to know if the superman is working out in a wheelchair.  Oh my God.  It's a great workout.  They had me do head, shoulder, knees and toes, knees and toes. 
[00:10:00]  Knees and toes.  I didn't, I didn't need to be, uh, pretty much, uh, pointed at and laughed at.  Wow.  Look at it.  We've never seen an atrophied butt like that before.  Well, they want to know if you're doing the parachute next where they just take the parachute  out and go, and you all get underneath it and go, Ooh, so what do you guys do last night?  Anything fun?  I think I just fell asleep in my yard. 
[00:10:30]  Really?  Talk about like, like an old person.  Really?  Sat in my chair.  And the next thing I know, flump, I'm out.  What the hell's going on with us?  We're shark jocks.  I got an atrophied butt.  You're falling asleep in your yard.  I've been exhausted.  I'm in my yard.  Get out of my yard.  You kids.  Yeah.  I was just exhausted yesterday.  So like I said, I'm good every other day with this job, with these hours, but I completely  screwed my sleep up. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I fell asleep and then I, I pulled over another chair and I was in it.  Like, I swear to you, I was in two chairs.  One, I was slouched all the way down in and the other one was directly across from me  and I had my feet up.  It was as if I was in the Apollo capsule.  That's how I was sitting or the Mercury capsule.  Right.  My feet were up on the back of the other chair and I'm laying on my back slouched.  I woke up.  I get, this is our medical bitching. 
[00:11:30]  This is our medical bitching break.  Sure.  It feels like someone stabbed me in the shoulder.  I slept all screwed up in the chair.  Yeah.  You just slept wrong.  Oh.  Yeah.  You got to get a hammock for that backyard.  A hammock.  I'm telling you.  The hammock is the way to go.  That's a good idea.  And then you get a nice, like, like one of those outdoor pillows and one of those nice  blankies and you'll, you'll really look like an old man.  I was too lazy to bring the lounge chairs out from the garage and put them out back because 
[00:12:00]  that's what I wanted to do.  I'm kind of, you know, lay back, but I was just twisted like a pretzel in two chairs.  That never, ever should have been used for sleeping.  That means you were really tired though.  Yeah.  That you fell asleep in that position.  Did I ever tell you the hammock story with my dad?  I don't know.  Well, one of us was bringing over a pod.  What was it made out of?  What the heck?  Yeah, no kidding.  Like the Hughes family couldn't just buy a hammock.  I'm sure it was constructed by the children out of some things that were found in the garage 
[00:12:30]  and people's piles in front of their recycling.  I laugh because I want to cry.  You're so right.  One of, uh, one of, one of, uh, my brothers was bringing home a broad and you know, you  can't have the broad sleeping with, uh, sleeping with the sun, right?  Not under my roof.  Not under my roof.  So, so dad, uh, offers up his, uh, his bed to the broad.  I forget which broad it was.  I don't think, uh, was he leaving at the time or was he just going to, or was he going 
[00:13:00]  to stay in the bed too?  All right.  It's just like, Hey, I'll offer my bed.  I started staying though.  Send her up here.  I started this by saying the hammock story.  Yeah.  So we all started asking my dad, I'm like, where are you going to sleep?  Cause I think someone was on the couch.  I think a lot of people happen to come home at the same time.  So we were trying to figure out where everyone's going to sleep.  And he goes, Oh, I'll just sleep on the hammock outside.  And we're like, dad, there's a lot of mosquitoes out there.  He goes, no, I got one of those. 
[00:13:30]  What is it called?  One of those, uh, citra citronella citronella candles.  I'll be fine.  So he brings a blanket, a pillow, and he puts one citronella candle under the hammock.  And he assumes that the smoke will just take care of the mosquitoes.  And, uh, where my family house is, it's, there's a lot of woods in the area and it, there's  a lot of mosquitoes to say the least.  Sure.  Fast forward to the morning.  He comes in from outside for his morning coffee.  We couldn't even, and I'm not even kidding. 
[00:14:00]  We couldn't even count how many mosquito bites my dad had.  We couldn't even count.  And he's like, good morning, everybody.  And it's all over his face, his neck.  He slept in short sleeves just everywhere.  Let me tell you, I think citronella is like, um, like airport lights to, uh, mosquitoes.  I don't buy that it works at all.  It smells like, you smell, I go, oh, I smell a little citronella. 
[00:14:30]  I think I'm safe.  And then, ow!  Well, you know, you just got mosquito bites all over you.  I think you're right.  I think it's a way to just, you know, get it over with.  It's called the get it over with candle.  Bring them in.  Bring them in.  Let them bite you.  And they're all full.  And now they leave you alone for the rest of the night.  You got to use, uh, off.  Yeah.  Off.  That's what I use.  I spray a little off on myself.  With toothpaste.  If they have, if you have mosquito bites, put toothpaste on them.  What?  Lapse the itching.  I think I'm going to brush the mosquito's teeth first so it doesn't give you encephalitis. 
[00:15:00]  It's very little toothbrush.  How hard that would be to hold a little mosquito gums up?  God.  And then try to floss him.  All right.  We're just getting harder.  What are we, old ladies?  Yeah.  No kidding.  A little mosquito joke.  I know.  Well, let me tell you.  We've admitted way too much today.  But I'm going to be rebuilt.  Yeah.  That's my goal, to be rebuilt.  Work on that atrophied ass first. 
[00:15:30]  Who else is going to admit they have an atrophied ass on the radio?  That's the beauty of us.  Of course.  You think that makes me look good?  No.  No.  That's probably something most people would keep to themselves.  But they did admit that I'm strong as an ox up top.  Oh.  Strong as an ox.  Atrophied butt, though.  877-212-ON-A.  Just getting started.  We'll do a little Olympic coverage.  We'll tell you where Gary Glitter is now.  We got a magician on Long Island with the perv switch thing. 
[00:16:00]  That's really funny.  Because they had to talk to the neighbors and stuff.  Was anyone surprised at this story?  I don't know.  We could get into that next.  Yeah, we should.  And then we got an update on the baby whale that thought that a yacht was his mother.  Yes.  This has a real funny ending, this one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just wait until you hear it.  All right.  And then you got...  Because it thought the yacht was his mommy.  Oh.  So he snuggled up next to a yacht.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  It's a cute.  Cute story.  Oh, wow.  Hold on a minute. 
[00:16:30]  Rob on Long Island.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Citronella attracts mosquitoes.  You're supposed to put it in the back of the yard to draw them away from the deck.  So you thought I had an invitation out there.  Sorry for him, man.  Oh.  I think we all get confused with those dumb candles.  Because we all, like, if you're outside just, like, kind of socializing a few beers around  a picnic table or what have you, you always put the candle right in the middle.  I'm supposed to put it...  I'm not a half-ass-fuse story.  Oh, my God.  Dude, you know what I've been doing?  I have these citronella oil tiki torches. 
[00:17:00]  They're all over the yard.  And I've just been surrounding myself with them.  It looks like some kind of devil worship thing going on.  I'm surrounded with this fire, and they're just coming and flying over and biting me.  To the mosquitoes, you're like Marlon Brando.  What a apocalypse now.  They love it.  They're just worshiping you.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  I'll put them in my neighbor's yard.  Well, that makes sense, because this candle was under them the whole night, and wow. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  It was quite impressive.  Thanks, Rob.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right.  We got a lot to do.  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  A lot of people are pissed at you, Rob.  Right before the break, we were talking about mosquitoes and citronella candles.  Good old Rob from Long Island said that you're supposed to put those candles, like, away from you.  Ah.  To attract the mosquitoes to a different area. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, but everyone is saying that the citronella is a what?  A natural what?  It's a repellent.  That's right.  It repels mosquitoes.  So in my dad's case, having the citronella candle right under the hammock should have helped.  But he didn't have enough.  Not enough.  Not enough candles.  To bathe himself in the smoke and scent of citronella.  So we want to correct Rob from Long Island.  Stunt brain, we're right with that one?  Or stunt Google, whatever the hell your name is?  Stunt Google.  No, this one I got you on.  I didn't have to Google this. 
[00:18:30]  It is a repellent.  And it's very, very accurate to say, put it on and keep them away.  All right.  What is this?  It's kind of cool, right?  I don't know this one.  This is something that Matt Jiven found and gave us.  Is that his first name?  Matt.  Yeah.  I never knew Jiven's first name.  Why would you?  I know.  Jiven, I think it's like Quincy.  He's so forgettable.  One name.  Sure.  He's a bearded guy with his svelte little torso down the hall. 
[00:19:00]  Even as I said, he's so forgettable.  No one heard me say he's so forgettable, which makes it even better.  Oh, wow.  He really is.  He's so forgettable.  He's like dumping.  Yeah.  He's dumping out of all the bad things said about him.  It's funny if he started just dumping things he didn't like.  Like, no, I like the Yankees.  I don't want to hear them bad mouth.  Is he the one guy that likes the Yankees?  Wow.  Who's not laughing at the Yankees at this point?  Boston certainly is.  By the way, good morning to everybody in Boston today. 
[00:19:30]  Not even going to make the playoffs.  Not even going to be close to making the playoffs.  You're Yankees.  Oh, they are.  Horrific.  Horrific.  What about Melky and Johnny Damon?  Johnny Damon.  How about holding on to a ball?  Jesus Christ.  Pudge Rodriguez.  That's a great move in 1995.  Idiots.  Almighty.  But, guys, the Yankees lost yesterday.  They certainly did.  Got trounced.  14-3.  That's not too bad.  Yeah.  What pitcher? 
[00:20:00]  I love the fact that this team has gone to the toilet.  Yeah.  Love it.  Big shakeup when Torrey left, and, you know, it's just having the Steinbrenner kids taking  care of business now.  It just really is a mess over at the Yankee organization.  But, Wade, Carl Pavano's coming back this weekend.  All right.  It'll be going for his sixth win in four years on that four-year, $40 million contract. 
[00:20:30]  Holy Jesus.  Yeah.  He's had an arm injury, a back injury, a butt injury.  Oh, atrophied butt?  Possibly.  Obviously, an atrophied arm, right?  Oh.  Possibly.  Really?  Travis did the math on it for me.  That's $6.6 million per win.  Wow.  That's a bargain.  Wow.  We'll tell you what a bargain is.  Ass.  Yankees are 10 and a half games out of first place.  10 and a half.  10 and a half. 
[00:21:00]  And you got the Red Sox, you know, in the wild card position.  So.  Seven games over .500.  They suck.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, they should never get rid of Torrey.  That just seemed weird.  Torrey is just a machine, man.  He hadn't won in seven years.  I actually didn't mind them getting rid of it.  I mean, I like Torrey, but it's like sometimes you got to move on.  It's just that the organization keeps bringing in these old men.  Yeah.  Nobody wants Johnny Damon.  Beat it.  Yeah, that's how you're going to win.  Yeah.  Stupid asses.  By the way, let's go, Mets go. 
[00:21:30]  Well, Mets doing very well.  Right, Danny?  Let's go, Mets go.  Hell yeah.  Booyah.  Booyah.  Yeah, we got 71 wins, my friend.  Mm-hmm.  We're 14 games over .500.  Yeah.  And remember when everyone was crying when they got rid of Willie Randolph?  That turned out to be the best move the organization has done in years.  Good.  Remember, everyone was like, oh, I can't believe they got rid of Willie Randolph.  They stapled his firing notice to his head while he was asleep or something.  Everyone was outraged at how they did it.  I was one of those people. 
[00:22:00]  Well, now it's good riddance, it looks like.  They forced him to go to what, L.A. or wherever the hell he was?  To the Yankees.  They're hiring him to play second again.  Yeah.  His new young kid they're bringing on board.  Yeah.  And then in the middle of the night, they fire Willie Randolph, and I was like, wow,  that's outrageous.  But the Mets know what they are doing.  They really wanted it to hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now they're 14 games over .500, my friend.  Yeah, they're doing very well.  14 games over .500.  And Kimbo Slice. 
[00:22:30]  Jimmy turned us on to Kimbo Slice back in the day.  Well, yeah, it's just a YouTube fighting animal.  Yeah, but they're going to do that rematch.  Yep.  CBS is going to do the Kimbo Slice YouTube rematch.  The guy, Gannon, I think he's a Boston cop, but he's the one guy he lost to on YouTube.  It was a brutal basement fight.  Is this the only guy Kimbo Slice lost to?  I think so.  It's basically, yeah, Kimbo Slice got really famous with the YouTube videos, and there's  a video of the Boston cop beating him up in a basement or something like that, and it's 
[00:23:00]  the only fight that Kimbo Slice lost.  And CBS saw an opportunity, like, wow, let's do a rematch.  Because the YouTube video is a sensation.  Yeah.  So, do we have a date?  I don't know if it's been worked out yet.  I mean, they said it again.  Oh, I thought you were asking, do we have a date?  I don't know where.  October 4th in Florida they're looking at.  Yeah, but CBS, stop.  They're going to do it in a ring.  Get a basement. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Make it look like Fight Club.  Get a basement.  How would you get an audience in there, though?  You don't need an audience if you got it on TV.  Yeah.  Or do a facade basement in the middle of a ring.  Oh, is that what you do?  Just build a fake-looking basement?  Yeah, in the middle of a ring.  Three sides.  But that's something I would check out.  Kimbo Slice in the rematch with the Boston cop.  But if that's where he's fighting now, though, it's like if that's already, like, this guy  wants to move up the ranks.  And if already they got him just kind of doing, like, an interest fight, like, hey, this  will be kind of cool.  It's like, that's not a good sign. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, not that Gannon's bad, but it's like, come on, he's not a real MMA contender, I don't  think.  Let's say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Obi, I just wanted to say thank you very much for publicly supporting the Mets as a Philly  fan.  That sets my mind at ease.  Does it?  Everyone knows I'm a Mets fan.  The Phillies are going down, my friend.  The Phillies are going down.  Hmm, heard it here. 
[00:24:30]  That's right.  Okay.  I think.  How many wins do you guys have?  I forgot.  Oh, I don't know.  I just wanted to, you know, I was actually about ready to give up on the season, but since  you're rooting for the Mets, I'm looking forward to a cold repeat of the collapse of last year.  Actually, it's a close race.  Phillies are two and a half games back.  68 wins for the Phills.  For the Phills.  My second favorite NL East team.  Oh.  Well, you know. 
[00:25:00]  Except the Philly crew, I got to like show some kind of loyalty.  Thanks, Brian.  All right.  Have a good one.  All right.  Let's go to Ken in Jersey.  Ken.  Hey, what's wrong, guys?  Hey, Ken.  Talking about Kimbo Slice, if anyone actually like watches fighting, he's a joke.  I wouldn't go that far, dude.  He's not a good fighter in any form.  He's not a joke, but he's just, he's more of a street brawler.  You know, he's just, maybe he's not as good as, I wouldn't call him a good fighter.  I wouldn't call him a joke, but he's certainly not, he's certainly not going to beat Liddell  or Rampage or Farris Griffin. 
[00:25:30]  If he's such a joke, would you get in a basement with the guy?  I wouldn't get in a basement with the guy.  He's a pretty big, scary dude.  But the way that CBS is talking about him, they're making it seem like he's the next Mike Tyson.  Well, I don't know about that.  I think they understand the YouTube video got a lot of hits and a lot of interest, and  they're capitalizing on that.  I don't think they're thinking that he's actually a great fighter or any of that stuff.  They just see an opportunity to get some viewers.  This guy's so scary, I wouldn't even play checkers with him. 
[00:26:00]  He's eating the pieces.  Oh my God.  Punching him in the face.  He shaves his hairy chest so he can show off one of his tattoos, but he keeps the other  side all hairy.  Does he really?  Yeah, he's an animal, man.  It's an odd thing to do.  All right, Ken.  This is cool.  This is like Rocky and Apollo Creed when they have their secret fight.  Yeah.  Do you want to go with the Long Island Magician?  Oh, yeah.  I was going to do an Olympic talk here, but why would we watch the Olympics? 
[00:26:30]  Did you watch it last night?  No.  Did you watch it last night?  Yes.  What'd you like?  He did not.  He's lying.  Did I go to the Don Cheadle premiere?  Yes.  Oh!  Did you get a picture with Mr. Cheadle?  No, I didn't see him.  Roland, I think.  Roland threw up and left.  He went home.  He was sick.  He threw up.  Yeah, he was sick.  Something was, you know.  Sick?  Roger Stewart syndrome.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  He texted me on the way out like, yeah, Don's on his way in, but who knows?  Roland is so awful with celebrity sightings. 
[00:27:00]  It literally could have been any.  I saw Tracy Morgan there.  That was the only guy I saw and some guys who were in the film.  Yeah.  But I didn't see Don Cheadle.  I didn't see.  Was the film good?  I liked it.  I didn't love it.  Oh, boy.  But it started out like okay.  I'm like, oh, this is going to suck.  I just thought it was going to suck, but then all of a sudden I started to like it.  But it's always better than I thought it was going to be initially, but it was okay.  Not the best review.  No, that didn't sound very good.  No.  Not the best review.  I love Don Cheadle, too.  I actually had to come home and watch Crash.  Really?  Afterwards, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  I like that Hotel Rwanda.  It was great.  He's good in that.  He's fantastic.  Well, he can't be good in every single movie he does.  He wasn't even bad.  I just thought it was a weird movie for me.  You know, sometimes they put a guy in a movie and you're like, eh.  Well, what's the movie about?  It's called Traitor.  It's about him as a Muslim kind of being involved in suicide bombings or helping to facilitate  a suicide bombing attack in the U.S.  Oh.  Yeah, conceptually.  It sounds like an interesting subject.  It was.  It wasn't a terrible movie. 
[00:28:00]  I just didn't love it.  It sounds like a ball of laughs.  It was a comedy.  They play, like, wacky music every time there's a bomb.  So Jimmy says it's a giant piece of crap.  That's the review.  No, it wasn't that bad.  Believe me, if it was, I would tell you.  But it was okay.  You're hoping to work with Don Cheadle someday.  Yeah.  I understand, Jimmy.  I trashed the board.  You are blowing up and you got to keep your options open.  But my acting's not improving.  Doing well on the radio and doing some good stand-up has nothing to do with my acting.  You know, I'm still going to bug out my stupid Jesse Jackson eyes in every scene I do. 
[00:28:30]  A little over the top.  Your South Park eyes.  Oh, it's awful.  Jimmy does South Park eyes.  Yeah.  Actually, thank you, Danny.  60% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com so far.  But maybe there's not a lot of reviews in.  That's kind of like what Jimmy says.  That's like, eh, you know.  Well, actually, there's five reviews in so far.  Two hated it.  Three liked it.  All right.  Hey, we got a magician on Long Island with that perv switch, my friend. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  We love the perv switch.  We all have it.  Every single one of us have it.  This guy, he's really twisted.  This isn't just perv switch.  This is your typical guy that got himself into a gig where he can be around the people he wants to victimize.  Don't you get into, like, a profession because you like a certain thing about it?  Like, I'm convinced, Vince, gynecologists, that they're into that. 
[00:29:30]  They figured out a way to make a lot of money checking out you-know-whats all day.  Yeah.  And then you get the guys, look, man, for every 17-year-old that comes in for her first exam,  we got to deal with grandmas.  Get that bullsrap every time.  A lot of diseases you got to look at.  No.  Yeah, we understand.  No.  If you're a gynecologist, you were smart in school.  Yeah.  You figured it all out.  And I'm thinking if you're like a clown for kids' parties or a magician for kids' parties- 
[00:30:00]  Oh, boy.  You might like kids a little too much.  Always a little bit of trouble.  Not all of them, obviously, but I'm thinking some.  I'm saying all.  Really?  I think if you put yourself in a position where you want to deal with other people's children,  there's something wrong with you, I'll give teachers the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah.  Because that's a job I think people go into thinking it's going to be this noble, going 
[00:30:30]  to change the world kind of a thing.  Sometimes it's just for the money, career, whatever.  They like teaching.  But when you get into like, I don't know, softball coach or I don't know.  You're the guy that runs the girls' field hockey team.  You don't even have to go.  The famous lesbian gym teacher.  Well, yeah.  Her too.  We talked about that over the years.  That isn't as shocking when it happens. 
[00:31:00]  You're a female and you're a female gym teacher and you get to go into the girls' locker room  every day.  It's paradise.  Three or four periods a day, you get to go into the locker room to make sure everything's  up.  It could be more depending on how many girls are synced up.  Oh, you mean classes.  Okay.  Sorry.  Like I've seen in the shining elevator doors.  If you're a lesbian gym teacher, that's got to be heaven.  Of course it is.  You don't even care that you're going to die someday because your whole life you're living 
[00:31:30]  in heaven.  Oh, people love saying like, you know, they're professional.  No, they're professionals like gynecologists.  Like, no, they're professional.  They handle things that, you know, they're looking just going sometimes, holy Jesus Christ.  Oh my God, that's amazing.  Dude, in my high school too, the gym teacher's office was kind of like, what's his name's  office, in Taxi, where it just overlooked everything. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, Danny DeVito, where it's the dispatcher.  And it was so obvious that she was a lesbian.  And now she's in this booth in the middle of the locker room.  Oh, it's not the greatest job on earth.  Nice.  Yeah.  But if you're a, you're a magician and you're doing kids parties, just that's, that's a  red flag right there.  He's spinning plates.  That's what I saw him on the news, spinning plates on a stick. 
[00:32:30]  He's doing things they did on the Ed Sullivan show for kids.  He never updated his magic.  No, he didn't have to.  He didn't want to.  Why would he?  He needs a few good tricks.  Yeah, he didn't have any interest in the profession itself.  Get his foot in the door.  It's like, all right, I can do a couple of things.  That's all I need here.  What parents are hiring this guy to come over and entertain their children?  I don't know.  Dummies.  Let's get into the story.  It's a good one.  He calls himself Long Island's favorite magician. 
[00:33:00]  But now Bob Infantino, who frequently performs his tricks with young children.  Infantino?  Italian for, I like infants.  That's a coincidence.  I'm surprised the name John Sterling gave one of the Yanks, the Infantino.  Belly to back.  Woo.  And a back to face and a crib to back.  Bob Infantino, who frequently performs his tricks with young children, is watching his reputation 
[00:33:30]  go up in smoke, his freedom vanishing before his very eyes.  Ah, magic.  Oh, magic.  Magic talk.  Come on now.  Up in smoke.  Vanished.  Vanished before his eyes.  Nice.  I get it.  Someone wants to be a writer.  Yeah.  With young children, is watching his reputation go up in smoke, his freedom vanishing before  his very eyes.  The 50-year-old magic man is under arrest, charged with secretly videotaping children,  taking their clothes off in his central Islip home.  Oops. 
[00:34:00]  Oops.  Why are kids taking their clothes off in his central Islip home?  Are they going to explain this?  I don't know.  They better.  Where'd this dumbbell put the camera that little kids caught him?  What a dope.  It's probably a huge three-camera shoot.  Yeah.  Just sitting there in the bedroom.  All right.  Get changed.  Don't mind those things staring at you.  Those lenses.  Three giant bunny rabbits with their mouths open and the lens in the mouth.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Brass charged with secretly videotaping children, taking their clothes off in his central Islip  home.  Totally horrified by that situation.  It's very scary.  We're four houses down.  You're four houses down.  You have a three-house buffer.  That's right.  Don't sweat it.  Is it going to come over juggling to your house?  Why does everyone have to put themselves close to the disaster always?  Anyways, I'm three towns over.  I was thinking of going to the Twin Towers on September 11th. 
[00:35:00]  Yes.  I was going to go up to that restaurant on September 11th.  Were you really?  Well, no.  But if I did that day.  I saw my cousins.  They're twins.  Very dangerous.  You're four houses away.  Relax.  He was doing it at his home.  He wasn't going to knock on your door and go, hey, I need your house today.  Can I hide some cameras in your house and invite young children over?  Right. 
[00:35:30]  What was he doing?  Oh, is that it?  What?  It was busted Thursday.  Robert Infantino, 50.  The police, they found hidden cameras in a dressing room at his home, a photo studio.  He works as a freelance photographer when he's not performing his family magic show or teaching  kids how to juggle.  All right.  I like starting with this.  Juggle these.  You can't drop them. 
[00:36:00]  There's only two.  It's very easy.  They stay together because they're all in one bag.  We're missing the obvious, though.  Let's take a picture to remember the day you started juggling.  The day you started juggling.  Oh, this guy is a creep.  Let's get more.  Magicians in general are creeps.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  In general, they are creeps.  They know it.  Not Fast Eddie.  Fast Eddie was just weird.  He's trying to get a little pipe booze.  He's like my father-in-law. 
[00:36:30]  I know Eddie for many years.  I like him.  He's not my actual future father-in-law, but my sister is.  All right.  He looks like Rizzo from M.A.S.H.  He's so weird.  He's a mechanic.  Yeah, from the motor pool.  Well, what magician had a sex island?  Copperfield.  Oh, Copperfield.  Yeah, David Copperfield.  Yeah.  He had Rape Island, where he would take women on his boat, take them out to this island  under the promise of hanging out with other people being there and his palatial house on 
[00:37:00]  this island.  And it wound up them just running around like a Jason movie, trying to get away from him  as he uses his magic to rape them.  Horrible.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Although the stories.  Yeah, the stories out there.  Are pretty impressive.  Here's more of the.  Disprove it there, magic man.  Yeah.  Here's more of the pedo magician from Long Island.  Infantino doubles as a photographer and has a studio set up inside a central Islip home.  Last month, he promised to do a photo shoot for a mother and her two daughters, ages 14 
[00:37:30]  and nine, for free.  Police say while the girls were changing into swimsuits and other outfits in another room,  one of the girls noticed a box with a hole cut in it and uncovered a hidden camera rolling  inside.  This guy's lazy, man.  He doesn't know how to do hidden cameras.  Just a box?  I mean.  Oh.  What?  A box with a hole cut in it.  A box with a hole cut in it.  What a one-way mirror, idiot.  And what despicable mother is taking her 14 and nine-year-old daughters over to some guy  for free, he's going to do the photography for free, and photograph them in their bathing 
[00:38:00]  suits?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  No.  Hello, you are.  Very nice.  It's like I'm walking on sunshine.  Sorry.  We just haven't heard that yet today.  We're changing into swimsuits and other outfits in another room.  One of the girls noticed a box with a hole cut in it and uncovered a hidden camera rolling  inside.  This young girl's pretty sharp.  I mean, she picked up on it and it didn't fold up, and she caught it. 
[00:38:30]  Other people didn't catch it.  Police say tapes taken from Infantino's home show there were other victims being secretly  recorded, and in court it was revealed his home computer was loaded with hardcore child  porn.  Infantino's in Dutch.  He's in Dutch.  Yes, try to get out of this jam, magic man.  Wow, that is, what a creep.  What a ghoul.  And Jal, they're going to put his face in a pillow and make his dignity disappear. 
[00:39:00]  Ta-da.  The aristocrat in the shower.  He makes sketches appear.  Playing hard to get.  I like that.  Yes, stunt brain.  He has a MySpace page that lists his upcoming gigs, and I guess you won't be seeing him  at the Ground Round this weekend.  Oh.  Cancellations.  Didn't the Ground Round fold?  Yeah, the big Ground Round gig.  In Leviton.  Oh, wow.  That's a biggie for a Long Island magician to get that booking. 
[00:39:30]  That's good.  Great.  Can I have any children that want to volunteer to come up here, sit on my lap?  He won 10 grand on America's Funniest People.  Really?  Yeah, it's on his page.  I wonder what he did.  Since this story broke.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Speaking of stunt brain, well, we discovered something the other day.  He's not too stunty when his computer goes down. 
[00:40:00]  Well, no.  He lost the internet.  And primetime Sam Roberts picked up on that.  So, just in case you missed it, check this out.  Just when you thought it was safe to come outside, we're back with more primetime gossip.  New CBS executive producer for O&A, Stunt Brain, has been hitting home runs left and right  since bursting onto the scene only a few months ago as the stunt brain to be used when O&A  need an extra mind to think.  His whole gig is he's stunt brain. 
[00:40:30]  When your brain's not working, his does.  He jumps in like a stunt man jumps in for an actor.  Like, he's our brain if we need a stunt brain.  And the head is just filled with so much knowledge that he has to call himself stunt brain.  Unfortunately for Stunty, the O&A internet network collapsed recently, exposing old Stunt Google for what he really is.  A quick typing, no nothing.  No, come on.  I don't think so.  How old is Christine Apple?  Stunt brain.  Stunt brain.  You know what?  It's not stunt brain.  It's stunt computer. 
[00:41:00]  He's just quick with the fingers on a computer.  You're like the Wizard of Oz.  Right.  We all think you're so smart and everything, but it's the machine.  No attention to that man Googling.  That's right.  Without the internet by his side, Stunt Brain's only real skill of supplying information became  virtually non-existent.  How bad was Stunt Brain without his laptop?  He was like, he was almost as smart as E-Rock.  Wow.  He made E-Rock look like, put smart guy in here. 
[00:41:30]  The irony of the unfolding events were not lost on some of the O&A crew.  We talked to one member who prefers to remain nameless.  I told you guys he wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.  What do you mean?  Do I have to spell it out for you?  He's thick.  Has Stunt Brain's stock gone down?  We here at PTG can't confirm, but certainly hope so.  Stay tuned for all the O&A news delivered to you when you need it from Primetime Gossip. 
[00:42:00]  Good morning, everybody.  Opie and Anthony.  I checked out the Olympics for a little bit yesterday.  The BMX stuff was awesome.  I don't know why we're not winning the gold medal on the BMX thing.  That's like an American sport.  Yeah, there was a crash, but we took bronze and silver.  Bronze and silver.  I also discovered that men's volleyball, beach volleyball, not as fun to watch as women's beach volleyball. 
[00:42:30]  Why is that?  Is it played differently?  Do they hit it over the net the same way?  You realize the sport itself is a bore fest.  Really?  But the bikinis make it so much more fun.  So you're saying put the guys in bikinis.  Well, sure.  And then...  That's exactly what I'm saying.  Ball bags for everybody.  Let's go.  Banana hammocks.  But I guess we won the gold.  I watched for a little bit.  This guy's 6'9".  It looked like it wasn't even fair. 
[00:43:00]  But we won gold in beach volleyball, the men's version, which is quite a drop-off from the female version.  Yeah.  That curry waltz in her ass.  Wow.  Well, as long as you don't...  Well, she's got two asses.  Go above the neck.  She's got one on her...  Between her shoulders.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunate for her.  God almost made a perfect specimen.  Yes, Jimmy.  Why is chess not an Olympic sport?  It should be.  All right.  Let me think that over.  Chess.  Absolutely. 
[00:43:30]  Why?  Because to me, it's like...  I don't know.  It's just ping pong.  Even though it is a physical sport...  Yeah, I'm trying to think.  Chess, to me, is a mental sport.  And it's a true art form.  It absolutely should be in the Olympics.  Yeah, but is there anything in the Olympics that requires zero physical activity like chess does?  Probably not.  I don't think so.  Yeah, I think you've got to have some kind of...  That would be kind of cool, though, to throw a couple of those things in the Olympics.  Of course.  Chess and maybe, like, Parcheesi. 
[00:44:00]  No.  Yeah, I like Parcheesi.  Video gaming.  Video gaming.  Call of Duty 4.  Yeah.  Guitar Hero.  Guitar Hero Olympics.  Right?  All right, here's the rule.  What?  What's the rule?  For a game to be in existence, it's got to be around for at least 500 years.  Oh, that's not fair.  Chess should be in the Olympics.  Just as an event, it should...  The Soviets would dominate, but it should be in the Olympics.  I mean, who wants to...  See, I'm looking at volleyball before...  It's like, we're monkeys.  It's like a bunch of people.  We're bouncing a ball in the air.  Yeah.  Trying to let it fall on the floor.  Stupid. 
[00:44:30]  Dumb.  Volleyball's kind of fun to play.  It's a little weird to watch, I guess.  It's a good...  Unless, again, you're watching the girls.  Yeah.  And then, this is what else I know about the Olympics.  The Americans dropped a baton twice.  I don't know how you're dropping a baton in the relay races in the Olympics.  We used to drop it in the high school track, but we were high schoolers, not Olympic athletes.  How are you dropping the baton still?  You've got to get all gay runners because they have three options to grab it. 
[00:45:00]  Here you go.  Your turn.  So, I know that much.  And then, I think that's it for Olympic coverage today because I was bored out of my mind.  Well, the women's soccer team won yesterday, which is kind of cool.  They beat Brazil 1-0 in extra time.  All right.  Thank you.  Women's soccer is pretty cool?  Oh, yeah.  You said women's soccer is pretty cool, and then I was expecting you to say, because the  score was 83-79.  Instead, you said it was 1-0 in overtime. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Oh!  That's the problem with soccer.  Soccer itself knows it's boring because they go to commercials while the game is still being  played.  And they come back and nothing has happened.  Right.  They know it's boring, that they could step away for 20 minutes and play a few commercials.  0-0.  That's the score for so long.  Right.  They just watched the same guys kick it back and forth.  It's awful.  I'm watching some highlights.  Is it highlights or is this the actual game?  The actual game.  You can't tell.  That's the beauty of soccer. 
[00:46:00]  You don't know if it's highlights or the actual game.  This would be the actual game.  It's on right now.  On MSNBC.  Oh, slow motion of a kick.  All right.  And that was all that was.  Wow.  Yeah, but this should be good right here.  Nope.  What's a...  I don't know.  I couldn't even deal with watching this.  No.  Playing the old lady being choked in the elevator for the 80th time.  Well, you want to talk about Olympic sports.  I think that could be a good one.  That could be an Olympic sport. 
[00:46:30]  Sure.  Assaulting old ladies in elevators.  Choke outs.  This guy wins the gold.  Choke outs in elevators.  That should be an Olympic sport.  What a cowardly douche that guy is, apparently.  He just preys on old people.  Let's say hi to Scott in New York.  Scott.  Oh, the other thing about the Olympics.  Hold on one second.  I guess they might strip the Chinese gymnasts of their medals because they're starting to  discover that they're way too young to be a big thing.  Really?  Yeah, that popped late last night, but Ant was telling me he read there wasn't any evidence. 
[00:47:00]  Is that what it is?  Yeah, they say they have no evidence.  They can't cut them in half and count their rings, so they really don't know when they  were born.  There's no real good documentation on these girls.  They have all these articles saying that they were born in 1994, and the Chinese are claiming  no, it was 92.  They'll all be 16, oddly enough.  You know, these communist countries, I'll say these communist countries, they're scary.  I bet you they go to hospitals as you're giving birth, and they do a few little things,  and they just know if they got an Olympic athlete on their name. 
[00:47:30]  That's going to be an athlete.  And then they just grab it from the parents and put it in some kind of Olympic work camp  for the next 16 years, and then they fix the birth certificates if they're developing  a little too fast to keep it all legal.  And then they, like, fudge birth certificates, and the next thing you know, your 14-year-old's  a 16-year-old, and she's walking away with gold.  Scott in New York, what's up?  Hey, boys, why don't they have the world's strongest man as an Olympic competition?  What do you mean, like throwing the barrels over the wall? 
[00:48:00]  They have on ESPN, you know, where you pull the boat, you lift the big tires.  That'd be a great Olympic competition.  You know what?  That's one of those, when you're just, you know, flipping around the channels, and that  strongman competition comes on, you've got to watch.  It's so ridiculous.  Yeah, I watch a lot of the classic ones, so I don't even know, are they still doing  it?  Oh, yeah.  Because I've seen some of the real old ones, and you realize how commercialized everything's  gotten, because you look at these old sports on, like, classic ESPN and stuff like that, 
[00:48:30]  and there's complete walls behind them with no advertising on them.  And there's, like, the barrels they're using, not one bit of advertising on it.  And then the new ones, everything just has advertising all over it.  All over the place.  They finally realized how to cash in on it.  The old days.  And they wear those ridiculous, like, gym shorts that you used to have to wear in gym  classes.  The old school gym shorts.  Yeah.  The stuff, though, they make them, like, just tip cars over.  Just the ideas they come up with are quite clever. 
[00:49:00]  Donna, who's a guy on Long Island.  Donna, what's up?  What?  What's your name, sir?  My name is Dennis, not Donna.  I don't know where they got Donna from.  Who wrote down Donna?  Now, it's a guy.  Pat Duffy, wait a minute.  It's a guy.  Now, if you thought his name was Donna, wouldn't you say, your name's Donna?  And he would just say, no, it's Dennis.  You need to get some new staff in there, I think.  No, you're Donna. 
[00:49:30]  Sorry.  No, it's funny, though.  He writes Donna on the call screen, and then in parentheses, guy.  It says guy.  Like, he was just stunned that his name was Donna.  So, I got to check it.  I don't want you guys to be confused, but his name's Donna, but he's a guy.  Do phone screeners only get one crack at asking the name?  Yeah.  I know that.  Yeah.  Like, what's your name?  Blah, blah, blah.  All right, three Gs and F and an R.  Sure.  Did they never say, wait, what was that?  I know, because they're constantly getting the names wrong.  Yeah.  That's great. 
[00:50:00]  If they can spell Vah, it's good, because my dispatchers can't spell Vah, so.  Hold on.  I got to stay right there, Dennis.  We're watching an old clip of the Strongman competition.  This event, they got three station wagons lined up, and these guys run, and then they have  to tip over the station wagon, and then they get to run to the next station wagon.  They got to tip it over on its side, and then finally the third station wagon, and then  they run over the finish line. 
[00:50:30]  Yes, clever name.  It's called the Car Turnover.  That's what they're doing.  They're turning over the cars.  There's a couple banging in each car.  Yeah.  All right, what do you got, Dennis?  Well, you guys were talking about the female soccer game before.  Well, even though Brazil lost, it was the most watched televised game, and it's been since  they started.  They won the last two Olympics, plus the World Cup.  Not that I'm a big female soccer fan at all, but they're better than the guys.  Are they? 
[00:51:00]  Very much so.  I'm starting to think that soccer is a lot more fun to play than watch or talk about on  the phone.  Although, yeah.  I played it.  My sister plays it.  She got a full right to college on it.  Oh, wow.  God bless her.  It just shows you that.  It shows you we're just so much different than the rest of the world in America, because  everyone else, every other country can't get enough of their soccer.  Yeah.  They love watching it.  They love playing it.  They also love starving.  And doing nothing. 
[00:51:30]  You know, if it wasn't for America, they'd still be lighting candles.  Come on.  They get nothing.  Very true.  Very true.  We brought them into the new age.  I hope little Jimmy's feeling better this week.  Thank you, sir.  My nose is going to be a big scab in it.  Why can't you're a dispatcher?  Why can't your dispatcher spell the...  What was that about?  I work for EMS in the city.  I work for the fire department.  Okay.  And, you know, they can't spell the...  If I showed you what they wrote us...  Yeah.  ...how people can't spell.  So I'm used to my name and stuff being a little confused. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  Thank you, Dennis.  No problem.  Have a good day, guys.  You too.  Right.  Also, it's coming out today that Obama has picked his vice president, but he's not  telling anybody.  Yeah, he's...  What's that about?  Well, I believe he's going to text all his peeps, which is going to take a long time.  Yeah, that's got to be...  Is he just going to sit there and go, hmm...  One by one, yeah.  Bob.  Yeah.  Let me text him.  It's going to be an individual text.  Each one he's got to do a little different. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  B period, O period.  Yeah, apparently he's going to announce his vice presidential running mate there through  texts.  Yeah.  So have your BlackBerry ready.  I believe if you went to his website or signed up and got the little text thing, you'll get  a text message that'll tell you who the vice president is.  See, he's trying to be hip, new, wow. 
[00:53:00]  Well, he's trying to get a database.  Yeah, that too.  Because you sign up for this and you get the text and then you get all the other Obama  info, I'm sure.  Spam.  Advertising.  Obama wants you to know you could have a bigger schlong.  He's probably casting all his vice presidential possibilities, making sure they're not doing  anything stupid like John Edwards.  He's got them all in a room, you know, smelling their fingers, shirt collars.  What have you done?  This is so top secret, though. 
[00:53:30]  Usually you can kind of figure out who they're going to pick.  In this case, Stuntbrain came up with this.  There's no way you're going to be right with this Kathleen.  Kathleen Sebelius, governor of Kansas.  My dark horse pick.  If you're going broad, you got to go Hillary.  Why wouldn't you go Hillary if you're going broad?  She's too galvanizing.  So you're going to pick a female that a lot of the country doesn't know?  Absolutely.  No.  It's Sebelius, Cain, or last shot is Biden. 
[00:54:00]  I don't think Hillary's got a chance.  I agree.  Who's the most conservative of the Democrats?  I would think Cain, probably.  He's the least risky of the choice.  But I think Sebelius brings in the whole Midwest.  I don't know.  I don't know if the Midwest will vote for my president.  For a chick.  Yeah, that's a death sentence for Obama.  And Hillary just is, yeah, she's too, people love her or hate her. 
[00:54:30]  That's it.  And I think if they're looking to get some swing voters, some of the disenfranchised Republicans,  you put Hillary in there, you're not getting them.  They'll just go, okay, I'm disenfranchised, but screw it.  I'm not voting for her.  He needs older white guys.  Simple as that.  He needs, yeah, he needs the older white guy, but then it'll look like business as usual.  Not too old, though.  But older white guy.  He put himself in a weird position with his platform of, you know, this is new, this is  change, it's not business as usual, we've got to change Washington. 
[00:55:00]  So if he gets an old white guy, they'll just be going, oh, more of the same.  But if he gets something a little extreme, they're going to say, this ticket's a little  too crazy for me.  Yeah.  For the traditional American.  Let's say hi to Edie from Florida.  Hey, morning, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Edie.  How's the hurricane?  Yeah, a little bit of rain this morning, but apparently it's coming back a couple of times.  I haven't been able to head one day off work, so, you know, it doesn't help me at all. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, this hurricane in Florida is actually really funny if you've been following it.  It just keeps swinging back.  It just won't leave Florida alone.  It's like one of those paddle balls with the elastic on it.  It just keeps slamming into them.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Hey, well, I just wanted to throw in my opinion there on the whole thing with the soccer, and  I think it's very true what you say about the cultural differences.  I was born and raised and lived in South Africa for 20 years, and even there, it was  more of a, and it's not like a race thing, but it really, really was a big thing between 
[00:56:00]  the black people and the white people, black people.  Really?  There was a big thing between blacks and whites in South Africa?  When was that?  I don't think we heard about it.  The white South Africans are all attributed to soccer.  Yeah.  The whole Mandela thing was all about soccer.  Soccer suck him.  Put a tie around their neck, fill it with gas.  That was Winnie Mandela.  Yes, she was pretty dastardly.  Yeah, that's probably the reason why when I came over here, Anthony, I brought the little 
[00:56:30]  brother to your AFS.  I've got the PS90.  Oh, hey.  Nice.  Nice weapon.  Yeah, I love it.  But yeah, it was a big thing, you know.  Then you got the Afrikaans people and the English people.  Afrikaans people love the rugby.  English people didn't love the rugby so much.  So, I don't know.  All right.  We're trying everything to get soccer to catch on in America.  We tried it with, what, Pele back in the day, right?  Now we got Beckman. 
[00:57:00]  No one cares.  Yeah.  And still, it's like.  Beckman, no one cares.  Right.  No one cares.  It's long.  There's one goal.  We have baseball and football, which the scoring is so different.  And hockey, why would anybody want to watch one goal a game?  Well, hockey's starting to suck because the scoring's way down.  They're trying to figure out how to get scoring up in hockey.  Well, even that, though, at least you have physical confrontations.  And I'm not a hockey fan, but this is endless.  It's on TV right now.  You know why hockey's better than soccer as far as the low-scoring games? 
[00:57:30]  You're getting the shots on goal.  You're getting the drives to the net.  You know, that's the stuff that makes it exciting.  You stand up in your seat.  You're like, oh, here it goes.  Oh, shot.  Save.  You know.  And soccer's just, ah, we'll just kick it around the field.  The field is giant.  And there he goes.  The goalie just kicked it a mile away from himself.  Half the guys are just walking because they know they're not going to be in the action anytime soon.  I hate soccer. 
[00:58:00]  And the guy just pointed there was a penalty.  Why?  Oh, I think he hit him in the neck.  Oh.  And they hit with their head.  With their heads?  That's a stupid move.  Yeah, pick the ball up.  Run with it into the goal.  That's so stupid.  Call it football.  I really try to figure out why soccer is so exciting to so many people.  And I just can't figure it out.  And we'll have people call up and try to explain it.  And I'm telling you, you're not going to come up with anything that's going to change my mind at this moment.  I'm watching it.  It's a bunch of guys on a lawn just kicking a ball. 
[00:58:30]  It's retarded.  Where's the strategy?  Like, yeah, I was just thinking, what's this guy thinking?  What's he thinking?  He's got the ball.  He's kicking it.  Is he thinking, like, I'm going to go down here and score.  I'll pass it to this guy.  Or I'll kick it to the opposite team member, which he just did, so he can kick it back this way.  I don't know.  They have set plays.  And the goalie kicks it another 10 miles to the other side of the field.  They do have set plays.  But I think part of the popularity comes from how cheap it is to outfit a whole team. 
[00:59:00]  Seriously.  Because most of these countries are from impoverished nations.  And they don't have a lot of money.  And an outfit of football player or a hockey player costs a lot of money.  And this is shoes and a shirt and a ball.  You know, the only good part of soccer is when the ref makes a bad call and gets killed by the crowd.  Boy, they love their soccer.  Oh, yeah.  Soccer.  There was a guy who made a bad call.  Oof.  The fans didn't like it.  Were they stormed the field?  Yeah, they killed him.  I think they killed him later on.  Yeah, after the game.  Oh, yeah.  Because you still need him for the game. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  To make it official.  Yeah, there's also in Columbia, they shot their goalie.  Well, there's a...  Yeah, the passion for the sport is pretty impressive.  Is that passion?  Or just...  Yeah, savagery.  Exactly.  Yeah, savagery.  Passion.  Oh, my God.  Like, I had three guys.  The ball came within four yards of the goal.  The excitement is mounting.  Now it's back in the middle of the field, quarter of a mile away.  But now it's within a quarter of a mile.  Oh, this is just...  It's madness, I tell you.  Now, this has been on for the last half hour or so, this game. 
[01:00:00]  How many times has there been a shot on goal?  Seriously.  None.  None?  The ball got within, say, you know, 100 feet on goal.  It's not right with the headbutts.  Oh, I think this guy hurt himself.  Oh, okay.  That was a good little highlight.  He came down on his arm.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Jersey.  Charlie.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Jimmy, I got to call you out. 
[01:00:30]  You're complaining about soccer being such a boring sport.  And I like chess.  You want chess in the Olympics?  Well, here's the difference.  Are you insane?  The difference is this.  Chess...  Kind of with Charlie on this one.  No, because chess doesn't have 70,000 idiots staring at it and then flipping cars over  and setting people on fire.  And they don't have to separate chess fans by country because they're too savage to sit  with each other.  And chess is a gentleman's game.  It's two guys in suits who have probably not gotten laid in 30 years just looking at each 
[01:01:00]  other across the board.  I think the popularity of soccer is pretty obvious.  I mean, every country has a pretty good soccer team.  And it's...  They're basically having a war.  Yeah.  It's like this is the next best thing to actually having an actual all-out war.  Yeah.  But besides that, I don't really, you know, get it.  Don't get it.  All right, Charlie.  Good point.  Good point.  I'm with Charlie on that one, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Bye-bye, guys.  I enjoy a game of chess every once in a while. 
[01:01:30]  But in general...  I mean, Jimmy reads chess books.  I look at them.  I haven't read one in a while.  You just kind of look at them?  What?  Look at the cover?  Yeah.  I like flipping through them.  Oh.  And then I would have to go to the bathroom and not let myself and then just play moves  out.  Do you look at old matches and go like, oh, yes, indeed.  Oh, I see.  I see.  I played them out, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  A little crazy.  Well, you know what?  There's a lot of...  With that, let's go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling the Colby and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs. 
[01:02:00]  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  I want to give a big FU to my ex-effing girlfriend that decided at the bar when I met with my new  girlfriend to come up to me and start talking to me and start f***ing you, you f***ing.  Next message.  Hey, this f*** you goes out to brass.  Quit staring at me in the gym, you homo.  Go choke on it, f***ing.  Next message.  This f*** you goes out to the f*** that was in front of me on the road who don't know 
[01:02:30]  how to read a sign when it says no tongue unwritten when f***ing pedestrians are present.  Thanks for killing my time.  F*** you.  Next message.  I'd like to leave a big f***ing dude to Dave.  God damn it, get to work and quit having me do everything.  Quit f***ing in the bathroom all f***ing day.  Do something.  F*** you.  Next message.  I want to give a big f*** you to the people that I work with.  They all f***ing suck and they just make me angry.  Next message. 
[01:03:00]  F*** you to the construction company that shut down Interstate 57 south of Mount Vernon, Illinois,  for bridge construction.  You could have put a sign up the road, told us what was going on, and I wouldn't have been  30 minutes late for work.  You dumb f***.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton. 
[01:03:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Vinny Brand from the Stress Factory waiting in our office because he got here early.  You just sit there, Vinny.  We'll get to you soon.  We got a bunch of chicks coming in, too.  We got a bunch of girls, yes.  Chicks are, um...  You're calling them chicks?  Yeah, I would like...  I'm happy.  It's too homoerotic in here.  It's a bunch of men.  Well, that's not our fault.  That's the lawyer's fault.  I want girls.  Well, we came back to K-Rock here in New York City, our flagship station. 
[01:04:00]  They welcomed us with, like, a stripper pole.  It's right there.  There's so much dust on it, I can't even tell you.  Oh, yeah.  Because they gave us the stripper pole and then said,  oh, yeah, by the way, you can't have naked women on your show.  Right?  Yeah, thanks.  I'll take a woman right now.  I'll take a woman right now just bouncing a rubber ball in a parka.  At this point, sure.  It's so gay here.  Anything.  Like a mose.  We're all running around looking at each other's bodies.  So we got to pick the K-Rock girls that are going to be doing street team stuff and appearances. 
[01:04:30]  What do we got?  17 girls and we got to get it down to 8 or something like that?  Yes, sir.  17 finalists.  Eight will be chosen today.  And the Pal Talk cameras are going to be here covering it live for the web.  Oh, good.  Oh, wow.  That means it's going to be hardcore lesbian action, right?  Yes.  Oh.  Just like the old days, right?  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.  Oh, is this going to suck?  Quit it now!  Yuck.  Not yuck to girls.  Yuck to what we get to do with girls these days on the radio. 
[01:05:00]  And do you remember?  Oh, my God.  There was some stuff going on that is probably illegal off the radio.  Yeah.  What about Bottle Rocket?  That's not illegal.  It's got to be.  That's good, clean, wholesome fun.  What about ping pong ball and eggs?  Lesbian couch.  What about the phone?  The phone challenge.  The cell phone challenge.  I'm talking about the daisy chain. 
[01:05:30]  Daisy chain.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now we got girls.  Hi.  My name is Stephanie, and I want to be a K-Rock girl.  And here's my bathing suit.  All right.  All right.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Lesbian couch now is actually two women in business suits discussing ideological differences.  Boo.  Sucks.  Remember the couple that we brought in to make the first stain on the brand new carpet that 
[01:06:00]  was put in at N.E.W.?  Yeah.  And we had them just go to town with each other.  Let's just say hardcore action in the corner.  Oh, my God.  While we were talking to Barry Williams.  And it filled the studio up with an aroma that was just horrid.  Oh, yeah.  And remember Pete Johnson?  Like, I think it was the days before guys decided it was still manly.  You could use baby wipes and still be a man.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Was it him?  Oh, yeah.  It was horrific.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:06:30]  And then Pete Johnson got mad at us because then we had to put police tape around the area  because now that rug had to be replaced.  That part of the carpet is stained now.  And how did we pay Pete Johnson back?  We made him wear a dildo chin.  A chin dildo.  A chin dildo.  Yeah, he put it on his chin.  Guy was an engineer for like 30, 40 years.  You don't remember that?  Yeah.  Pete Johnson was such a trooper.  He worked for the company for 30 or 40 years.  He finally retired. 
[01:07:00]  I think he moved to Greece or something.  He had dreams of living in Greece.  He's probably in Bayonne, New Jersey, though.  I bet you his dream never came true.  I'm sure it didn't.  What a great guy.  Years and years with the company.  And near the end, we forced him to wear a chin dildo.  Chin dildo.  They're giving me a gold wadge.  Yeah.  So, nothing against the hot girls that are going to come in in about a half hour, but  it's going to be a bore fest for everybody.  I can't even pretend that it's going to be something better than that. 
[01:07:30]  Hey, I think it'll be fun and exciting.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How are we going to make it exciting, my friend?  Where are their dossiers?  Yeah, let's see the dossiers.  I like their dossiers.  They give us dossiers on each one of the girls.  We're looking at a lot of hot girls, absolutely.  But then what?  Well, that's just it.  In the old days, it wasn't good enough to just be hot and come in to do our show.  It's our job as entertainers.  Remember Cigarette Smoking Girl? 
[01:08:00]  Oh, who could forget that?  Right.  She actually made smoke rings by flicking her belly button.  It was fantastic.  What did we get today?  Maybe a peek at a firm tummy.  Times have changed.  We'll see.  I like that one.  These are...  Dude, we'll see.  These are the same girls we brought on stage to save us at the comedy show at the PNC,  and we were hoping for somebody to wow, and not one of them wowed.  Because I guess that's against corporate policy, too. 
[01:08:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  We're just looking through some of the pictures of the candidates.  Oh, P.  What is her face?  They're a lovely...  I don't think that one made the cut.  Well, no.  She is going to be in here.  All right.  I'll see.  Oh, yeah.  She's white.  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  What is this?  One good, one bad?  I'm going to the picture.  Yikes. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, my God.  Where are the white women at?  It might just be bad photography, too.  What is that?  Well, that's pretty...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She's got a gang in her mouth.  I guess it's some kind of, like, I don't know, a little thumb in the mouth.  Where are they, Steve?  They're on the conference room filling out paperwork at the moment.  Are they listening to the show?  Of course.  Get the paperwork done, of course.  They're, um...  Yeah, they are, but there's a lot of yapping going on, so whether or not they're actually  listening remains to be seen.  I'm sure they are.  All the paperwork.  They're filled out.  People are begging us, please make them cry. 
[01:09:30]  That's very attractive.  It's not their problem.  It's just what radio's become.  We can play a fun little game.  They want us to do this for the station here in New York, and I'm like, but this is...  What are we going to do?  How many girls are there?  Wow.  Uh, 16, 17, whatever.  Really?  Okay.  Here's the deal.  Odds are...  Odds dictate that at least one of these girls is having her time.  Let's play a little game.  Okay.  Which one is having her time? 
[01:10:00]  Okay.  We'll try to figure it out, because out of that many girls, at least one.  All right.  Now we're on to some...  Steve, it's your job to go into that room, and this is what we actually have to do.  Okay.  How many girls are having their time?  They raise their hand in secrecy, and then you come back with a number, and then we have  to figure out which ones are having their time.  Now, you got to sell this, Steve.  Now, go down the hall right now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me preface this a little bit.  Steve, you're going to have to sell this.  You're going to have to use diplomatic skills.  What's that?  That means, yes, walk in and say, look, I'm going to ask you a question. 
[01:10:30]  It might be a little awkward and stuff, but I really need an honest answer.  Like, present it like that.  You're a little forceful, but be nice and make it like it's a fun thing.  You know, smile a little and go, I know, it's a little, but I need an honest answer.  So, be running in with a baseball bat would be a bad...  Yeah, yeah.  Who's on the...  You know, you can't jump in like that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  It's called diplomacy and tact and a little bit of...  I thought he should just walk in, open the door and go, can I have your attention? 
[01:11:00]  How many of you slits are bleeding?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Wow.  See, I don't think no...  Hold on.  I got to cross out something then.  I don't think that works.  That's not the way to do it.  Tell them we're playing bingo and the daughter's broken.  That's the way to go, Jim.  Thank you.  Uh...  Yeah, tell them we're doing the white couch test.  Yeah.  I think you have a way to...  So, you want the total number. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  Total number.  Okay.  And if anyone's lying or they don't answer, then we're not having them in.  Let the station figure it out.  Because we say the guys know...  If no one says anything, just go, look.  Like, some of them might fess right up.  But if they don't, then you got to go to phase two, which is, look, the guys know.  They have ways of sensing these things.  And they will be able to pick it out.  So, we just need a little honesty.  Yeah, tell them if they don't tell the truth, we're going to have Pat Duffy do a little, you know... 
[01:12:00]  A little, you know, a little golden retriever on him.  It's like I'm walking on sunshine.  Yeah, we're going to have Pat Duffy...  He's going to do some huffing.  Yeah.  He's going to huff.  This is Pat Duffy going down the line.  It's like I'm walking on sunshine.  It never ceases to amaze me that we had weeks to plan something. 
[01:12:30]  Whoa, whoa.  I'm going to defend the entire show.  Yeah, we had weeks.  Or a few days.  But we all were sitting around like, oh, is this a waste of time?  Let's just get it over with.  Yes, Danny.  The first I heard of this was yesterday, after the show.  Well, no, I heard about it maybe a week in time.  I went yesterday, after the show.  But just that...  And I'm putting myself in the barrel, too.  It's just like nobody...  We didn't even say, let's try this.  Well, what are we going to try?  I don't know.  Maybe Anthony's idea.  Well, that idea I like a lot.  I'm just like, that pretty much is an idea just until something happens. 
[01:13:00]  Because here's what happens in these circumstances.  You get 16 girls that come in here.  What do you get?  Another day older and deeper in debt.  No, you get 16 girls that come in and boo.  And they're going to have personalities, some of them.  So maybe we roll on that.  You know, that's how it works.  I like the spontaneity.  All right, we're going to try.  Fly by the seat of our pants, as they say.  Why don't we play...  Why don't we make the girls make Olympic flags? 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  Well, that depends on what we were just talking about before.  We can certainly make the Japanese flag.  What other flags can we make?  The Japanese flag can be made, but she'd have to be dropped from some height.  Well, I see a yellow and red flag.  We can make one of those.  Make that.  Yeah.  Hmm.  We'll have it, man.  I'm sure it'll be fun, fun, fun.  Right?  You're becoming a corporate guy, man. 
[01:14:00]  That's what you got to do.  You're being too corporate.  Corporate man!  You know damn well this is going to suck.  It's going to rule.  Oh, by the way, I want to thank the fine folks at QuickCheck for the...  Thank you, QuickCheck.  ...the delicious breakfast today.  Oh.  12-inch hot Italian subs.  For breakfast.  Yeah.  They're good any time, Opie.  They're great any time. 
[01:14:30]  Six in the morning, seven in the morning.  I don't even think they would agree with that.  Hot Italian sub.  Sure.  Ooh, meat products in the morning.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Look, we all know their food is fresh, it's delicious, but it's still eating lunch for  breakfast.  That's the problem I got.  Lunch for breakfast.  Yeah.  When you wake up in the morning, do you want a big heaping pile of pasta? 
[01:15:00]  Ooh, a heaping helping.  And I love pasta, but guess what?  I like it in the afternoon or at night.  Yeah.  I like Italian subs.  I just don't like them at six in the morning.  Well, you know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to take one with me and eat it for lunch.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All six inches?  Yeah.  Rawr.  But thank you, Quick Check, for trying once again.  Mm-hmm.  We asked for healthy, we got cookies and Italian subs that people eat at lunchtime. 
[01:15:30]  Thank you.  They did throw in some strawberries, though.  Thank you for that.  That's nice, see?  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  We got that update on the baby whale.  Oh, we were talking about this the other day.  Oh, what a cute story this is.  Yeah, it's a very, and a very good ending to the story, by the way.  That's the update today.  We start with the original story.  Animal conservationists say this baby whale could die within days if it doesn't find a new mother.  The calf, believed to be about a month or two old, was first spotted near North Sydney, Australia, on Sunday. 
[01:16:00]  Instead of latching onto its mother for nourishment, it was trying to suckle from a yacht.  Suckle from the propeller, dummy.  Did that guy say Australia?  Australia.  Australia.  I know I misspeak from time to time, but Australia?  Stupid whale.  He was trying to suckle off the yacht?  Off a yacht.  That's great.  Suckle from a yacht.  The calf really needs its mom's milk.  It's a desperate situation for that young calf without its mother's milk. 
[01:16:30]  Wildlife officials say they think the whale's mother abandoned it.  We placed it in a position yesterday, or it placed itself with our assistants in a position where it could communicate with other whales or its mother if it was there.  Whales.  All right, I got...  It's a wacky accent.  We got an idea.  I got an idea.  Anthony's idea I like a lot.  Hey, is Steve coming back with the number yet, by the way?  E-Rock, problem?  What's the deal?  Before Steve got down there, apparently the K-Rock people never turned the radio off in the conference room. 
[01:17:00]  Ouch.  But they turned it off before Steve got there, so the girls are lying with their answers, and Steve's buying it.  So he thinks like 15 of the girls all have their periods.  Oh my God, see?  Because they probably think that not having your period means you're going to have to get naked.  So they're lying, or they think that we're going to ask them to do something they don't want to do that's violating.  So they're going to lie and say, I have my period, that this way they won't ask me.  Right.  Oh my... 
[01:17:30]  And Steve's buying it.  Yeah.  Is the radio off now?  It's off right now.  All right, because we got 17 girls?  16, 17 girls, and we got to pick eight?  I say we give one away to the first girl that pukes.  Hmm.  First girl that pukes will get a spot, no matter how ugly they are.  I don't care.  They'll probably be pretty good at it.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  You know, girls that want to keep in shape, they kind of puke up that food.  Sure.  The good ones, anyway.  The old two-finger workout.  Yep. 
[01:18:00]  Here we go, more whale.  Rescuers towed the yacht out to sea.  The calf detached from the boat, but it eventually returned to the inlet near Sydney.  It's moved back in here.  It's still showing a suckling habit.  It's quietly going around from boat to boat, which confirms that it is a young calf,  and it probably still was suckling and reliant on its mother.  Officials say it would be impossible to artificially feed the whale.  They believe its only remaining chance for survival would be to find another female whale to adopt it. 
[01:18:30]  Or how about letting nature take its course?  The mother left it.  It's obviously a dumb calf.  Yeah.  The mother gave birth and realized what a dud.  The father was probably a drunk.  And the mother was like, enough with this idiot.  Yeah, why do we feel like we have to do that?  Like, save this thing?  This is something that should just die.  He's sucking on boats.  He's an idiot.  Yeah.  Stupid.  I've never been that hungry that I tried to drink from somebody that wasn't a human.  Dude, I thought you were my mom. 
[01:19:00]  Dude.  You know what, dude?  I'm under the yacht.  All these people are trying to help me.  Dude.  Stupid Bob.  Help my fin, man.  Well, we got a very good ending to the story.  Happy ending for this little calf.  Yes, very happy ending.  The baby whale that adopted a yacht after its mother abandoned it is going to be euthanized.  Australian wildlife officials say the whale calf is injured more than they thought it was, 
[01:19:30]  and there's nothing else they can do.  One official says it looks like the calf was the victim of a shark attack.  That's what they had worried about before the decision was made.  It's just too weak.  Maybe too late.  We should have acted on it.  We didn't have a protocol in place for this sort of thing.  Experts knew without a lactating female to nurse the one- to two-month-old whale,  its time was limited, and they were working against the clock.  The baby has been trying to suckle on boats in the waters north of Sydney,  making worldwide wars, and dominating the media in Australia since Sunday. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Good.  Old lamp oil.  How is there no way to feed it?  Put it in a big tank, hang an udder in the water, and go ahead, eat it.  If it's drinking out of boats, it'll probably take a sip out of the udder.  What's wrong with people?  Just put it on the beach, throw some water on it, and give it some milk.  Like you said, we hid no protocol.  Protocol, wow. 
[01:20:30]  We hid no protocol.  Stitch it up and kick it back in.  Yeah.  Or let it go.  How do they know it won't survive?  Why don't you let it swim somewhere?  They did.  It swam back to an inlet.  It's stupid.  It's got a big tongue, a Moe Howard haircut.  Stupid.  Dummy.  Well, we're going to get Vinny Brand in here next. 
[01:21:00]  He's going to help us pick out the K-Rock girls.  Are we just picking eight hot girls, and then we can move on with our show?  Yeah.  Could this be like two minutes?  Hot, not, hot, not, hot, hot, not, hot, hot, not, hot, hot, not, hot.  Goodbye.  E-Rock's got an update.  Yes, E-Rock.  Oh, no, no update.  Oh, you were laughing.  Where's Steve?  Yeah, what the hell?  He's still down there?  No, he's compiling data now.  We'll get Steve in here.  What's the criteria for choosing these girls? 
[01:21:30]  Steve, how many girls are having their time of the month?  They're compiling the list right now, just so you have a sheet right now.  It's, I don't want to say.  I think it could be close to 50% of them.  No, we want to say that.  That's what, the whole bit is knowing the number.  I understand that, but Ron's heading up the sheet right now.  We don't need, we don't, are they being honest?  Yeah, totally.  So almost half of them?  Well, actually, you know what?  The first time I asked him, 14 out of 15 fessed up, and then I went around individually. 
[01:22:00]  All right, tell them, the one with the heaviest flow gets in, gets a spot.  How the hell do you find that out?  Yeah, how do you?  The old foot race?  No, the old belly flop onto the floor test.  With the white construction paper behind them.  Yeah, we'll get like a slip and slide that's white, and then just have them just.  This coppery Rorschach test.  Right, just slide across the floor. 
[01:22:30]  We put them in a tank with a shark.  He attacks it.  All right, well, we're going to like pick the girls next.  Yeah.  Can I make all my decisions just based purely on race?  Why?  I don't know.  No, because you only like white.  I didn't say it's going to be my preference or any race like that.  I'm just going to use race as, because people are doing it with the presidential election,  why can't I do it with this? 
[01:23:00]  This is more important.  All righty.  I concur.  There's a lot of ethnics on this contest.  Is there?  A lot.  Well, maybe I'm going with Hispanic.  A lot of ethnics.  Maybe I want a Latina.  Hip-hop, yo, what's up, kid?  What do you got?  Hip-hop pop?  Let hip-hop do it.  Oh, see, that wasn't supposed to be given to us.  Why?  Because we're guessing.  You guys want to guess?  You want to wager?  Or do you just want straight up?  How many girls are having their time? 
[01:23:30]  Four?  Nice.  All right, good.  We should guess.  That's going to be the first part of the contest.  Let's put money down.  Huh?  We should put some money down.  Everybody gets to pick.  It'll get all dirty and red.  Oh.  Put money down on a bet.  Yeah.  Okay.  I thought you meant something.  Boo.  All right.  We'll get Vinny in here.  We'll look at the girls.  Beautiful girls.  Go to K-K-K-Club.  K-K-Club.  We don't even have our hope up today.  We just know how this is going to end. 
[01:24:00]  We know how this is going to end.  We know how this bit ends these days.  In the old days, you never knew how it was going to end.  I'm hoping.  Is it going to end with one of the girls in the bathroom with Jimmy?  Or one in the stairwell with Stinky?  How is it going to end?  I'm in for a pleasant surprise, I think.  I think we're all going to be in for a pleasant surprise.  It's going to go well.  Oh, you optimist.  It's going to, yeah.  I'm just trying to keep the audience here.  No, I say go away.  This is your opportunity to go away today.  Get out of my way. 
[01:24:30]  Go see what Scott and Todd are doing.  Yuck.  Or Matty Siegel, if you're in Boston.  What the hell is he doing today?  Is it boring up the airwaves once again?  Tim, what do you got?  Tape.  He's got tape.  Why do you have tape?  Is it something to trip over this cable?  Oh, I thought we were going to duct tape the girls.  Now we're talking about something.  All right, well.  We're going to pick the eight K-Rock girls next. 
[01:25:00]  And we have an extra camera here in Pal Talk.  So if you're on Pal Talk, you must log on to Daniel's camera.  Because we're going to get up close views of the girls, I would gather.  You're going to be covering the girls.  Wow.  All right, see?  So if you've got Pal Talk, you're going to be able to see the girls.  Wonderful.  Boredom from all angles today.  Why do you have the camera pointed at me?  Nobody's going to want to see me.  We're not in here yet.  Okay, fair enough.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, Danny needs to thank some cops. 
[01:25:30]  Really?  Unfortunately.  Thank you, Sergeant Thorne and Officer Rondini from the Greenwich Precinct for helping me out.  Are you crazy?  Maybe you shouldn't be telling them, saying their last names.  I don't think they did anything bad.  They just like, you know.  I'm just thanking them very much.  Thank you.  They're assistants.  Did they give you back your pants and allow you to leave the grammar school?  For once, it wasn't me that needed the bell money.  Oh, okay.  Get out of here.  Thank you guys very much.  They moved the decimal point on his Dewey test. 
[01:26:00]  Back three spaces.  E-Rock, before we take a break, run down the hall, because Steve takes way too effing long.  Wait a minute.  E-Rock and run.  True.  Good point, good point.  Yeah, just lean forward and then allow it to carry you when you're walking.  Roll down the hallway.  Ask the girls how many are willing to allow Pat Duffy to...  Give a little test.  Yeah.  We'll see how good Pat Duffy is at sniffing out some... 
[01:26:30]  I'm with you, Pat.  I see you're making the mustache gesture back there.  He wants to make a mustache?  Out of you-know-what.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  See, ask the girls how many are willing to let Pat Duffy, you know.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  There goes E-Rock.  You can't possibly still be listening at this point. 
[01:27:00]  We warned you.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Although, we ran out and we got some pregnancy tests.  We're going to do a surprise pregnancy test on these broads in a little while.  Vinny Brand, what's up?  Not much, man.  I'm just...  Thank you for having me in.  I'm miserable.  Why are you miserable?  It doesn't matter.  You know what?  This is...  I have too many kids.  And I like my kids, but they've made me...  I have no life at all. 
[01:27:30]  I'll let you pawn one off on me.  Can I pick?  Yeah, but...  I think I know.  No, because I know you're going to pick my one daughter.  You have no life.  I don't do anything but kids' stuff.  And it's making me very unhappy.  Last night, I spent a night drafting a five-year-old soccer team, which is...  Drafting five-year-old soccer?  You've never seen anything like it.  Really?  Yeah, it's a bunch of parents.  And like a fight broke out. 
[01:28:00]  And I'm sitting there thinking to myself, are these people out of their mind?  We're drafting a five-year-old soccer team.  Who cares whether or not you win or lose it?  Like fantasy football?  No, no.  Where you get together with your guys and you pick your fantasy football team?  And when you're doing that with five-year-olds?  Five-year-old kids.  Or a soccer team?  And you have to draft these kids and then you coach them.  And they don't even care.  The kids all stink.  They're five years old.  Why are we talking about your five...  They all stink.  Why are we talking about your five-year-old when we can talk about your 17-year-old?  19.  Oh, Charles is 19. 
[01:28:30]  Okay.  I got an email.  Because you did one of our...  Who knew that you had a hot daughter?  I know.  It has to be said, Vinny.  I'm sorry.  But she's hot.  And she's got an attitude to match.  So you're in deep trouble.  I know.  That kid makes me nuts.  And what I didn't like is her going to the O&A Roadshow.  That bothered me on many levels.  Yeah.  And I sat next to her, Bobby Kelly, talking about what Bobby Kelly talks about.  Yes.  Yes.  And she looks over at me.  She goes, I don't find any of this funny.  I was like...  Yes, you do.  Good taste in comedy, obviously. 
[01:29:00]  Brutal.  She's a very good looking girl.  I did not like you plugging that.  I paid for an ad.  And this is the ad.  Oh, the stress factor.  Vinny Brand's daughter is hot.  I'm like...  I don't...  You were paying to pimp out your daughter.  That's pretty much...  That's the brilliance of us, Vinny.  We're getting people in the seats.  You know that.  Yes.  Just in a weird way.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm talking about the funny comedy acts that you get down at that club of yours.  We're talking about your hot daughter.  Yeah, exactly.  You should have her open every show, not you.  She came in the club last week in a little, like, sundress. 
[01:29:30]  And I know that that sundress on another 19-year-old daughter...  Girl, I'd say, oh, that girl's hot.  Yeah.  He's going to correct himself on another 19-year-old daughter.  Yeah, and someone else's kid, it's hot.  On her, I'm like, change the dress.  I'll just get rid of that dress.  You can't wear it here.  And she's a pretty girl.  I just don't want her to be hot.  I think she's going to do some stand-up, too.  Too late.  She's got a little...  As long as she's not standing up on a pole, I don't care.  Whoa!  Hey!  She's a very pretty girl.  And so is the older one, but the older one's very... 
[01:30:00]  You got an older one than 19?  And they're identical.  They're both gorgeous.  But the older one's really way more uptight.  She doesn't like the dress.  She dresses like a whore.  She says, you know, it's not really a whore dress.  It's a nice dress.  It's just how the kids dress these days.  It's how the kids dress.  Yeah.  All right, Vinny.  You're going to help us pick out these girls.  I hope they're wearing the dress that my daughter wore.  No, I think we got them at least in bikinis, because that's great for radio.  E-Rock is the one that's going to be escorting each girl to the microphone? 
[01:30:30]  Yes.  Oh, great.  Stump Brain, what horse craft did you get us into?  Can you set this up for everybody?  And why didn't we say no?  What, were we tired when you asked us?  Yeah, we must have been sleeping.  Yeah, I caught you guys in a weak moment, sleep deprived.  And this was the culmination of about four months of online voting.  And these were the finalists picked by the K-Rock listeners.  What, on the website?  Yes, sir.  So could they go to a website to at least see what we're looking at?  They can go to onaradio.com right now.  Or the PalTalk cameras are up, too. 
[01:31:00]  So you can see what's going on.  Yeah, but most people are in their cars right now.  Oh, wait.  Then that's not going to help either.  No.  So they can go to the office and look at onaradio.com and see the girls.  There's a lot of PalTalkers, though.  So what's the other room they have to open to see?  What is it?  No, it's just this room.  Oh, his camera's in our room?  Yeah, the live room.  Oh, yeah.  See, you're on it right now.  I know I am.  Great.  Is there a name for this room, or is it still top secret?  No, no, never top secret.  This would be the, Jesus, Opie and Anthony live room. 
[01:31:30]  Okay, good.  Yeah.  So people can take a peek at what we're looking at here.  Mm-hmm.  All right, E-Roc, let's bring in the first girl.  So we got 14 or 15, and we got to, like, narrow it down to eight.  Yes.  And we're also going to guess who's on their you-know-what.  How many are on their...  Wow.  All right.  You're in.  We have a winner.  Right?  How many are left?  Jesus.  All right. 
[01:32:00]  She's fantastic.  This is Lisa.  Hey, what's up?  Why would the mic work, Tim?  Why?  Try it again.  Say, hey, what's up again?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, why would it work?  No, why would the mic work?  Why would it have been tested?  It had been in there.  When I walked in this morning, I saw the mic there.  This was Tim's only job today.  I was like, what's going on today?  And I go, oh, yeah, the K-Rock girls.  The mic has been sitting there for hours with every single possibility to test it if it worked. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, well, now...  Why is there now a handheld?  There doesn't have to be.  There's a mic stand right there.  I really don't care what she has to say.  Yeah, Tim will just do it this way.  It's fine.  Lisa H., how are you?  You're from Cherry Hill, New Jersey?  I am.  Why isn't that working?  E-Rock, it can't be the mic stand.  No, whatever he did, he just undo it.  What?  How is that working?  All right, now that one's working.  That's impossible.  That's impossible.  Why wasn't it working?  No, he switched them.  Tim just switched them.  Whatever you did. 
[01:33:00]  I didn't do anything.  Now that mic works.  Now that mic works.  All right, one more time.  There we go.  We have a winner.  Holy mother of God.  All right, Lisa H. is from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.  Wow.  And the picture we're looking at sucks.  You're way better in person.  Thanks.  Yeah, I don't like that picture too much.  Hard picture.  Hard picture.  We were...  Well, Pete was holding the light reflector, so...  Who?  Blame it on him.  Oh, really?  Pete, yeah.  What, they were just lighting you up?  We were in like the front booth or whatever, and he's holding like this white piece of  paper, and the guy's flashing pictures, and the lights in my eyes and stuff. 
[01:33:30]  Not very professional.  This is Vinny Brand from the Stress Factory.  Yeah, hello.  How are you?  And basically, the contest is very easy.  We're trying to decide if you're hotter than Vinny's daughter.  You're going to be one of the K-Rock girls.  They're all hotter than my daughter.  I have to tell you, how old are you?  I'll be 22 next week.  All right, so that's all right.  I can look at that.  That's 22.  I can't look at 19.  19's weird.  That's what my daughter did.  This is a very good looking girl.  Thank you.  Does your father know you're walking around like this? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Well, he will.  I'll tell him after.  Does he get up tight?  Like, if you walk around...  Oh, stop with the fatherly crap.  No, I want to know.  Why are you taking the sexiness out of this, Vinny?  I want a bathing suit.  People have sex with guys' daughters.  Face it.  It just happens.  I just don't want to think about it.  I have four daughters.  Let's keep the sexy questions going.  How do you feel about all the soldier deaths in Iraq?  Jeez, really.  Sorry, go ahead.  Oh, damn.  No, I mean, I work in a bathing suit.  I work at a beach bar in Atlantic City during the summer. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, really?  It's kind of my uniform anyway.  That works.  I mean, he's come down to the bar before, but...  Vinny wants you to turn around.  Vinny, just ask her yourself.  Jesus.  Yeah, well, there it is.  You probably get a lot of comments on that.  Which beach bar?  Bally's.  Very nice.  Hey, because this is radio, Lisa, could you describe yourself?  Like, color eyes.  You got the brown hair.  Well, yeah, I'm a brunette.  I have blue, green eyes.  It changes, I guess, depending on... 
[01:35:00]  What I'm wearing.  I'm pretty tan.  Like I said, I work outside, so...  In my bathing suit, so...  You got tan lines?  Pretty dark color.  Yeah, a little bit.  Little tan lines.  Nice.  You can't really see them too much.  Yeah, a little.  You got...  Holy...  Well, a little butt crack.  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Are those 34 C?  No, that's not a C.  That's a B.  Tops.  Hey.  Oh, sorry.  Jesus.  Go easy on me.  Beautiful.  Small C.  Yeah, I'm a 5'3".  115 pounds. 
[01:35:30]  So...  Yeah, you're...  I mean, there's nothing wrong with you.  And she is a K-Rock girl.  Yeah, you're a K-Rock girl.  Wife and...  We might have a problem.  If you're number nine on that line out there, you're screwed.  Well, we have to ask questions, too.  Q&A score.  All right.  What part of your body do you put a hat on?  Your head.  Congratulations.  Good.  All right.  All right.  Ten.  We're also...  How many girls?  Five?  Four.  Four are having their you-know-what.  Oh, wow. 
[01:36:00]  Mm-hmm.  Got about that.  So are you supposed to guess who it is, or they already told you?  We don't know.  We don't know.  You don't know.  Yeah, we're not sure who.  We have...  They're going to quiz you afterwards?  Bring in Pat Duffy.  Pat.  Do your job.  I would say, but on Lisa, I would say no.  Why?  Just based on her personality.  She's smiling.  Very good.  Yeah, she's smiling.  No, a very nice personality.  Thanks.  And there's nothing billowing. 
[01:36:30]  I see.  He's wearing a very small swimsuit.  Would you allow Pat Duffy to maybe, I don't know.  Can I just tell you the answer?  No.  Why not?  Pat Duffy will tell the answer after he does what he does.  All right.  He won't touch you, though.  Okay.  You touch me.  No, Pat doesn't touch.  This girl could scrap.  I could tell.  Now, Pat, go do what you have to do.  All right.  Excuse me. 
[01:37:00]  Mother of God.  Wait, wait.  Why isn't there a mic with Pat?  Why wouldn't there be?  Why wouldn't there be?  That's not working.  Why wouldn't it?  Wait, wait, wait.  Tap that mic there, Steve.  Tap that one.  Oh, now that's working.  There it is.  All right, Pat.  Do that again.  That's amazingly good.  She's clear.  She's clear.  She's clean.  So you have to tell us at the end.  You don't have to tell us now.  I don't have to tell you now.  I like the fact if she says yes or no now. 
[01:37:30]  But that will narrow it down towards the end.  It's okay.  All right.  Like we'll ever remember.  It's okay.  Actually, I am.  I thought that's why they put me first.  Wow.  You are.  Cool.  That's good.  But there you go.  This is my bad mood.  There you go.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Pat, what's wrong with you?  I guess I'd have to smell a clean one first for a comparison.  No, that's good.  I enjoyed that a lot.  A lot of girls can be very fresh.  You also brush your teeth with dog feet.  Right.  You're a terrible barometer.  So maybe he's confused. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  All right.  Lisa, you're in.  Wow.  I don't even care who comes through that door.  You're so in.  You're in the automatic.  You're like the, don't they give you a spot in bingo?  Second bingo joke of the show.  Yeah.  Free spot.  Yes.  Boo.  Is it fair to just say she's in without.  Yeah, she's in.  I think so.  But yeah.  Because I've seen some of these pigs that are going to come.  Oh, my God.  Are the girls very competitive out there?  No.  Actually, everyone's really awesome.  We've all kind of been like keeping in touch ever since the comedy tour, which, by the way, 
[01:38:30]  Jim, you were awesome.  Oh, thank you.  I really enjoyed it.  We got to sneak off after we presented the car and actually got to watch your routine.  I wish she was saying that to me, like we got to sneak off.  Get it?  Boo.  But we couldn't find you backstage, so.  Way to drop the ball, Jim.  All right.  We got to move on because we're never going to get all these girls in here.  Well, some will be run through a little quicker than others, I think.  All right.  Watch how fast some of them come in.  Why does she have to leave?  No, no. 
[01:39:00]  Hang around the stripper pole.  What's he doing?  Yeah.  Some girls will stay.  Some will leave.  I think.  Can she just touch her nose?  Got to go.  You know.  All right, E-Rock, who's next?  This is Jolene from Staten Island.  Jolene from Staten Island.  Hi, Jolene.  Staten Island.  Hello, guys.  How are you doing?  That's it.  Good.  Good.  Very good.  I already like her.  We're going to have a problem.  Staten Island's a problem, though.  Uh-oh.  Why not just have 16 girls?  I agree.  Why not?  What do you...  Describe what you look like for the audience because it's radio. 
[01:39:30]  Okay.  I'm 5'3".  Blonde hair.  Highlights.  Well, my hair is actually brown with blonde highlights.  I don't know.  Why don't you tell?  Oh, oh, we were.  How tall are you?  You said 5'3"?  5'3".  And she said 115.  You're about 100...  No, I'm about 100 pounds.  103 pounds.  Oh, she's fantastic, too.  This is going to be difficult.  All right.  You married? 
[01:40:00]  Single?  Not that it matters.  Single.  Good.  That helps.  How many kids have you had?  Yeah, how many kids?  Two.  Yeah.  Oh, a mommy.  Why did you say that, Vinny?  How did I know that?  Yeah.  The belly button has the wrinkles.  Yes.  They have the wrinkles on the belly button, which is indicative of a child.  Well, listen.  Two kids and look like this.  In the next competition.  Yeah, you look great.  Thank you.  I mean, I'm not saying you look bad.  Don't get me wrong.  I just know.  Why are you attacking it, Vinny?  She looks great.  Huh?  Wow, Vinny.  Jesus, Vinny.  You asked me the question, I answered the question.  You're really going to town.  She looks fantastic. 
[01:40:30]  Thank you.  What did you say, Vinny?  She looks great.  Body came back.  I didn't say she looked bad.  Did you ask me a question?  I answered the question.  The body came back for two kids, Vinny.  Yeah, she did fine.  What's the problem?  How old are the kids?  Eleven, and my son was five.  She had eleven years to put it all together again.  That's a long time.  An eleven-year-old kid?  And five.  And five.  How old are you?  Twenty-seven.  Wowie.  That's a mess.  Wow, wow, wow.  Right.  Now, how old was the father of the first one?  Wow, wow, we, wow.  He was three years older than me.  Okay.  All right, so we have to ask the question, right? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  How many left shoes do you wear with each pair of shoes?  How many pair of left shoes?  All right.  Oh, no, wait.  No, wait.  How many left shoes do you wear with each pair of shoes you have?  I think I would wear one.  Good.  Excellent.  She does well.  All right, Jolene P.  All right.  All right, we're...  Score that one.  We're scoring that one.  I think she looks very good.  What?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Pat Duffy.  Oh.  Pat Duffy's not going to touch you.  I promise.  Okay.  Yeah, he's going to...  Turn to Pat Duffy.  He's doing a test.  I did it.  He failed the first one.  Yeah.  My redeeming chance.  Yeah.  All right.  Go, Pat.  Now, there's definitely a difference between the two.  Oh, yeah.  And I would guess to say that you're clean.  Yes.  Yes.  Wait, do you know what he's asking?  Clean can be one thing.  What do you mean by clean?  Are you bleeding? 
[01:42:00]  Yes, I am.  Oh, my God.  I suck so bad.  What?  What?  Wow.  Wow.  Look at you.  Pat Duffy, man.  What the hell?  All right, Jolene.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  She stands back there, too, right?  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  E-Rock, the next girl from the Bronx.  Angela P is coming into the studio.  I say no.  Of course.  All right.  You're in.  Hi.  All right. 
[01:42:30]  Vinny, what do you want to ask Angela?  Hi, Angela.  I have no questions for Angela at all.  I'll think of one while we're doing it.  But, I mean, how old are you?  26.  26?  In the Bronx.  Six.  She could scrap.  Yeah.  She's got a razor blade under her tongue.  I do.  She does look a little rough.  Why do you want to be a K-Rock girl?  Because, um...  I know.  I know you know, but I had to go, yeah, so you could say, I know.  I just think it would be a really cool job.  I love music.  I love K-Rock. 
[01:43:00]  I love you guys.  Ooh.  What do you love about us?  You're hilarious.  You're funny.  Hilarious and funny.  Name one funny thing we did.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Christ.  This is where it gets uncomfortable.  Every day you're funny.  Yeah.  Every day.  Yeah, name one.  One thing.  Just one.  Okay.  Just one time we were funny.  That made you laugh as you were doing what you do.  All right.  One bit was, like, I think the other day with, uh... 
[01:43:30]  I don't really know what it was, but...  No, no.  But it was really funny.  I was looking at something and somebody, like...  Am I off?  She's completely making this up.  No, no.  And you kept playing the bit of...  Oh, no.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  All right.  She pulled that out of her hat.  All right.  We have to ask a question, too.  What is the estimated gross national product of Moscow?  Very good.  Yes.  That's a good question, Jimmy. 
[01:44:00]  Moscow.  Moscow.  200,000?  All right, Bob.  What did I...  And could you describe yourself for the audience?  Are you Hispanic?  Yes.  Hispanic.  Dark hair, dark eyes, beautiful body.  Got the Bs, right?  Yes.  About 5'3".  Yes.  Any kids?  A lot of 5'3s.  No.  No children.  Wow.  Vinny, do you like the belly button?  Yeah, the belly button's fine.  She could have done better on the breast department.  I have a bigger chest than this girl, which is problematic for me. 
[01:44:30]  You got mommy issues?  No, I'm just saying, Jim.  There's nothing wrong with small ones.  I didn't say it's any wrong.  I'm just saying.  You're proportioned.  He wants to see your hiney.  He's embarrassing.  Yeah, did he turn around for...  Oh, my God.  Vinny's a hiney, man.  I don't really have much of a hiney either, but...  Oh, you got an atrophied butt like yourself.  Yeah, it looks atrophied.  Atrophied.  What are you talking about?  I got a trainer that you might want to see.  Now, Pat, you ready?  All right.  And one final thing from Pat here.  All right. 
[01:45:00]  You're bleeding, right?  No.  Oh, my God!  Pat Duffy sucks.  Pat, I don't think you could say that.  Yeah, I think they're going to dump out it when you say that.  Yeah, you got to be careful.  But you're wrong again.  I am, of course.  Pat's wrong again.  You're 0 for 3, Pat.  I know.  I suck.  What?  What happened?  What?  Hey, Pop, Ron keeps making comments off Mike over there and wants to know if he can replace  Pat Duffy because he's convinced he could do a better job than him.  Well, maybe you both do it and then you guys, you know, work together. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Ron, is that a fetish for you?  Angela P., thank you.  Very nice.  Thank you.  We're going to move on with Stacey F.  We've got to go through this a little faster because we're going to run out of show.  Did she stay or go?  I'm not sure.  On the bubble.  Hi.  Stacey F.  From West Islip, New York.  West Islip, huh?  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  A taller girl.  How tall are you?  5'9".  And, uh...  Yes, you're wearing flip-flops.  I know.  I didn't know everyone was wearing stripping. 
[01:46:00]  No, I mean, you know, stripping.  No, I'm just saying because you're tall.  If you wore heels, it would really be, you know, taller.  Yeah, I'd be a giant.  Yeah.  What do you do in West Islip?  I hang out.  No work?  Bartender.  Uh, guest bartender.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have trouble with the draft beer.  You have to pull the handle and then push it back.  It's very tricky.  Hey, it's difficult.  Have you told it?  Vinny, what do you think of the belly button area?  The belly button.  This girl has a nice body. 
[01:46:30]  This girl's taller, which I like.  Mm-hmm.  Thighs are a little heavy.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm just kidding.  She's Vinny.  Look, do you want me to judge?  I'm going to judge.  Vinny is the worst.  We want you to judge with a little tact, perhaps.  This is not what I do.  I'm an honest guy.  So, but you look good.  So, you think the hips are a little too big?  Huh?  The hips are too big, you're saying?  No, the thigh is a little, uh, it looks like maybe she could do some, uh, lunges for  the thigh.  I did do them two days ago, but.  You should be doing them more often.  Uh, and a high heel would have thinned the thigh out, which would have put you in contention 
[01:47:00]  with number one.  Not for the other two girls.  You're fine, uh, uh, gals.  But this girl here with a little lunges could have been competing with a girl in the blue.  Really?  Yeah.  I think she's so far number two for me.  What color eyes you have?  You've got dark hair.  Yes.  And your eyes?  Brown.  Brown.  I also think a better haircut.  I think if you get something like a, uh, a bob, you look good in a bob.  Well, I cut my hair really, really short and just growing out now.  All right.  Bob?  Yeah, it's called a Bob, Norton.  It's a...  Like the posh spice?  Yeah, a bob cut.  Like, uh, like, uh, that Sienna Miller. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, I see.  That haircut.  Not like Bob, like the guy named Robert.  Right.  You're talking about a little bob cut.  All right.  If you had a beehive, like a, Annette Funicello, what's wrong with you?  Her hair's fine.  I, I didn't say her hair was bad.  I'm saying a bob would look a little better.  And, and the top, is it big enough for you, Vinny?  Because you're, you seem to like the, you seem to like the really big ones.  Not really big ones, just, uh, you know, a little more, uh, 34B?  Yeah.  Should be bigger than me.  All right.  34B?  Yes.  Good eye.  All right.  That's, uh... 
[01:48:00]  That picture doesn't look like you either.  It's really big.  These pictures are awful.  Yeah, we didn't want to, we didn't want to do this contest because we saw your pictures  and they stink.  We're looking and going, these are awful pictures.  Yeah.  Who took them?  This one.  Dude, break your camera.  Sonny Corleone ought to throw that on the ground and not pay you money.  He's got to be gay.  You don't know how to make a girl look hot in a picture.  I'm not a photographer of girls.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Dude.  You're shining light right up into their face.  Soft lighting, my friend.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Stacy F. from West Islip. 
[01:48:30]  Thanks, man.  That was all in something.  Oh, wait.  We didn't do the other thing.  Yeah, the Q&A.  The Q&A.  Pat.  Oh, yeah.  The other thing.  Yeah.  Ron wants to try out.  All right, Ron.  Let's give Ron a shot.  Don't worry.  He's not going to touch you.  No one touches.  He's just...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's what I like.  A little fight.  All right.  No, no, no, no.  No, you just upped your score.  That's what I like.  What the hell are you doing?  The girl says, no, you're not sniffing my vagina.  Whoa!  Wait.  Oh, sorry.  What did you think we were?  I'm trying to say that everybody did that.  Yeah, everyone else did it.  Everyone else did it.  He's not touching you.  You just upped your score for me.  Just saying no. 
[01:49:00]  No one touches, though.  No one touches, though.  No one touches you.  That's all right.  Well, are you having that, you know?  Oh, no.  Okay.  That's what we're trying to find out.  That's right.  And Chunk One from Pleasant City, Ohio, he loves your lips, because they're watching  you on Pal Talk right now.  Thank you.  All right.  I don't like the fact she wouldn't let Ron know.  Yeah, that could hurt you.  She doesn't want to.  That could hurt you in the end.  That could hurt you in the end.  No, that's got to help her.  She said, no, you're not doing that.  That's all right.  Yeah, she was like, step off.  Yeah.  All right.  All right. 
[01:49:30]  Cool.  Thank you.  All right.  Join the other ladies.  She looks very good on the Pal Talk, too.  Very good.  There it is.  Dana Marie L.  Let's see what other pictures they had that they ruined over here.  Kenilworth, New Jersey.  Hi, guys.  Oh, she's a happy one.  It's another awful picture.  It's awesome to be here.  Thank you so much.  Really?  And Vinny's going to love your boobs.  See, Vinny?  That's the size you like right there, right?  Yeah, but the thighs.  You know, it's awesome.  I know.  Jesus, Vinny.  Sorry.  Oh, my God, man.  Don't go into a swimsuit competition and not expect to get judged. 
[01:50:00]  I'm just saying.  It's not a swimsuit competition.  Whatever it is.  It's not a misogynist.  A wrap.  A wrap would look good.  A wrap would make the whole package.  A wrap?  A wrap?  A wrap.  You wanted to put on a sarong?  Yes.  You know what?  You look good in painter's pants.  What a freak.  I'm just saying.  But she's got the bigger boobs, so that might, you know.  She does?  Bigger boobs, a little bigger hips.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing wrong with it.  These girls are all fine young women.  I'm just saying, in the swimsuit score, I have to take away points. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  And how tall are you?  I'm about 5'3".  Another 5'3".  5'3".  How many pounds, Vinny, would you say?  I would say this girl is 121.  Right.  There you go.  What's wrong with 121, Vinny?  There's nothing wrong with 121.  And 111 would be great.  And what color are your eyes?  Brown.  Brown.  Brown eyes.  Very nice.  Anything else for Dana Marie L?  We're never going to get to the end of this.  That's the only problem.  You have to do a Q&A.  Oh. 
[01:51:00]  What size is your breast?  C.  36C.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The 10 on the Q&A.  And would you let Pat Duffy not touch you, but get close enough to a certain nether region  where he could inhale through his nose very, very hard and see if he can detect if there  is a certain thing, a biological function going on with you during this time.  Oh, we got a yes.  He looks way too happy to do it.  Well, he probably is.  He's also looking for a new girlfriend. 
[01:51:30]  This is so wrong.  Oh, it just smells really good.  So now that...  So that means she's having that.  Yeah.  How about Ron?  Because Ron just turned that awful hat the other way.  Pop Ron.  Ron sucks.  Horrendous.  Very nice.  Yes.  All right.  Wait, Ron, you contributed nothing.  You just wanted to do this.  So what would you say, yes, yes, she is, no, she isn't?  I'm going to go with no.  You're right.  Oh, finally.  Finally.  Jesus.  It's a toss of a coin with this idiot. 
[01:52:00]  You had a 50-50 shot on five people and you got one.  Right.  So far so good.  All right.  You stink.  We better take a quick break and then we'll continue with who?  We have Lisa Marie.  Lisa Marie R.  Mm-hmm.  How many do we have to go?  We have a lot.  10 more.  We're never going to get this done.  All right.  Very good.  Should we bring one more in?  Thank you, Dana.  Thank you, guys.  We're really late for a break.  Let's do a quick break and then we'll have to run through this a little faster.  All right.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony with Vinny Brand from the Stress Factory.  Where are you going to be this weekend, Vinny?  I'm going to be the Trump Marina Saturday night with Greg Fitzsimmons at the Trump Marina. 
[01:52:30]  Greg's a very funny comic.  Greg is very funny and I'm hysterically funny.  Very good.  Who's going to be running the club if you're not there?  I guess Kate, the girl Kate, will do it.  She's good.  I love Kate.  Yeah, we love Kate.  Kate does a nice jam.  Oh, yeah.  Charlie Murphy this week.  Okay, good.  Don't promote Charlie Murphy at your club when you've got a gig to promote.  Go to the Trump Marina.  Charlie's already sold out.  I have sold 17 tickets.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:53:00]  A message to the affiliates.  We're going late today.  You do what you got to do.  We understand.  Awesome.  But there's no way we're going to be able to finish this in 10 minutes.  If you got to cut out to go to local programming, we understand.  But we're giving you the option.  We're in the middle of picking the K-Rock girls here in New York City.  K-Rock is our flagship station here in New York City.  And we got like 15 or 16 girls.  We got to knock this down to eight. 
[01:53:30]  And they will be the winners.  The next girl is coming in.  Her name is Lisa Marie R.  And we got Vinnie Brand who's helping us with the judging today.  Who's going to be in Atlantic City, I think, this weekend, tomorrow night?  Yeah, tomorrow night.  Where again?  The Trump Marina, tomorrow night.  Ticket to Ticketmaster.com.  Believe that.  It's going to be a good show.  I have some confidence, man.  I know.  How long have you been doing this?  I haven't done it a long time.  You know what?  I'm going to have a good time.  It's going to be a good show.  Love yourself properly.  You're Greg Fitzsimmons opening actor. 
[01:54:00]  That's so true.  Vinnie, can I just say that I love your club?  Thank you very much.  I've been there.  I saw Davis Howell.  I like this girl already kissing my ass.  This is perfect.  Look at that.  She knows what she's doing.  The Stress Factory girl.  And can I have one more request?  Can I just touch Sam's hair the whole time?  No, yeah.  Get in there, Sam.  I just want to, if I feel like, if I just must it up a little bit.  Can we put Sam's head between your legs to make believe it's the 70s?  That's pretty good.  Okay, I feel so much better right now. 
[01:54:30]  It's comforting, isn't it?  We do it in the elevator sometimes.  Yeah.  It's like a little pillow.  It really is.  Yeah.  I might just fall asleep.  Well, we got Lisa Marie R.  She obviously has a lot of personality.  White House Station, New Jersey is her hometown.  How tall are you?  Five foot two and three quarters.  Five foot two and three quarters.  Another five.  Three quarters makes a big difference.  It really does.  Yes, it does.  And you got the dark hair, shoulder length.  What color eyes?  Brown.  And are you Hispanic?  What do you got in there?  I'm Hispanic, Native American, and Italian.  Native American.  I like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, you like to drink. 
[01:55:00]  Nice.  She didn't deny it.  Oh, and she's got the inner bicep tattoo.  One on the other side, too?  What does it say?  This is Don't Stop Believing, and this is Jersey, and it says there's no place like home.  What is the Don't Stop Believing for?  A Journey fan.  Don't Stop Believing.  Just a Journey fan?  I love Journey.  Okay.  Really?  Maybe you're a Sopranos fan.  I don't know.  I didn't like that.  I wasn't a fan of that.  Or does Don't Stop Believing symbolize some type of philosophy you have on something?  Just Don't Stop. 
[01:55:30]  Believing in what, though?  Just Believing.  Believing in general.  A Loch Ness Monster.  Jim, really?  Yeah, I don't know.  Don't get mad.  I'm not.  I'm like, this girl has more feist.  This girl gets a 12 on the Q&A.  Shut up, Jim.  It's your problem.  Just don't stop believing.  What number correlates with a C?  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  And, Vinny, it's to you.  All right, here's the deal.  So, I like the bathing suit choice because she's trying to, and I know you like the club. 
[01:56:00]  I'm taking away points for the tattoo because, you know what?  In 30 years, they're going to look like shit.  No.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  That's what you got.  You just can't stop cursing.  Basically, in 30 years, you want to say the tattoo's going to read, don't stop sagging.  Right.  You're going to have to cut your arms off to maintain your otherwise nice figure.  Thank you.  And, but other than that, pretty well.  Breath, Bob Infantino would love.  And, other than that.  Wait, you don't.  The boobs are too small again? 
[01:56:30]  He's got mommy issues.  He needs the big.  They're really not small at all.  I don't understand what he's saying.  Don't stop believing that someday these will grow.  Exactly.  But she kind of has the boob, like, it looks like they're going to grow a little more.  I hope so.  How old are you?  21.  21.  You got a couple months left.  Maybe.  You're very, very.  I love the attitude.  I don't like that.  All right, very good.  That's Lisa Marie R.  I think you impressed the judges.  Woo!  All right, let's move on.  We've stopped the other competition for time constraints. 
[01:57:00]  Well, no.  Well, can Pat Duffy?  No?  She's covering up the head, so there's your answer.  How are you doing?  All right.  All right, we got Michelle C.  Yep.  The first one-piece bathing suit.  Yes.  Why the one-piece?  In the competition from Farmingville, New York.  Yes.  Farmingville.  I think I got some cousins out there, actually, in Farmingville.  Do you where?  In the Farmingville area.  Where's E-Rock?  I want to bring E-Rock in to help us with the judging. 
[01:57:30]  E-Rock?  Yeah.  Grab my mic.  What do you think of Michelle C., E-Rock?  I don't think you're going to be a K-Rock girl.  Why?  Why?  No.  That's pretty quick.  We didn't even talk to her, you dummy.  Why would you say that, E-Rock?  She's got, like, that 1920s swimmer body.  Are you kidding me?  You see every piece, because it's all covered up, and if you were wearing just a regular  bikini, it might not have been as bad.  I don't think it looks bad. 
[01:58:00]  That's, uh...  What are you trying to say, E-Rock?  What's up?  There's, uh...  She's a little more girl than the rest of the girls.  I am.  I'm curvy and voluptuous.  It's all right.  It's the...  Zoft-tick, I think.  Maybe you could be a, uh...  Maybe you'd, like, do a black radio station bathing suit.  Why did you say that?  Enough.  I'm just saying.  Look at Kenny just laughing his ass off at that one.  Yeah.  Kenny, why money?  Oh, wait.  Kenny, why are you laughing?  Tell Jenny Craig to grab a sandwich over there. 
[01:58:30]  Move on.  No.  You know what?  Wow.  What is wrong with you people?  Being meanies.  You don't...  I'll sit wherever you want.  That's fine.  I am.  I like it.  Well, you got the big, uh, D's.  Yes.  You got the big D's there, Vinny.  And you got a nice personality, and I would suggest a burka for your next competition.  Oh.  Why, Vin?  What's that mean?  What does that mean?  Yeah, what is a burka?  A full cover.  Exactly.  No, explain to her what that means.  She doesn't know.  I want a full cover.  There's nothing wrong with her face.  No, when you say burka, she thinks king. 
[01:59:00]  Tell her what a burka is.  I think you should wear a more bathing suit.  Okay.  More bathing suit.  She's got a one piece on.  I think you need a whole piece.  She has great cans.  I gotta say, your breasts are fantastic.  Thank you.  I think Michelle's fine.  Nice girl.  Seems nice enough.  But I'm gonna call her M-Rock, though.  Why?  Of course, she's rocking.  I'm trying to think.  Her name's Michelle.  Oh, okay.  Michelle.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  I like Michelle, and I think we need, like, different body types for the K-Rock girls,  because, you know, there's gonna be guys that are into that look.  Exactly.  Right?  I bet you don't have any trouble, right?  You go out.  Oh, no.  You perch those things up on something.  Yeah, a little bit, go out, and...  A little later in the evening.  Are you saying she's a little later in the evening?  She's one of those a little later in the evening girls?  Vinny, what are you trying to say?  I'm just saying. 
[02:00:00]  You're just saying, all right.  I completely disagree.  Right around 2 a.m.  She does fine for herself.  Yes, she's a very attractive girl.  Look at the calluses on her chest.  Jesus.  What do you mean?  Well, just a lot of action on the...  Yeah, see, yeah, yeah.  All right, very nice.  I think Michelle's terrific.  Vinny, what do you think?  Mm-hmm.  You good?  She'll be fine.  I just want to do the Q&A.  Can we do the other thing with you?  Yeah.  See, she's a trooper and everything.  Yeah, exactly.  Trying harder, Opie.  Right.  He looks a little scary, but he's not gonna touch you, I promise. 
[02:00:30]  She's got my vote.  Absolutely.  By the way...  Yes, by the way, Pat Duffy, you are exactly Pat Duffy's type.  I have a thing for giganticism.  No, that's not even right.  That's not...  Be honest.  No.  You like girls...  100% my type.  ...that are full-figure gals.  Pat would date you.  Yes.  Seriously.  I would wrestle you.  I'd wrestle you back.  Do you like Pat Duffy?  He's cute. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, he certainly is.  Yeah, I have a way with fat girls.  Hey, it's funny.  Don't be so brutal.  There's no reason.  Well, this is an important...  How old are you?  21.  This is an important time in your life.  I know.  You're okay now.  Like, in a few years, this could get out of control.  No, I'm keeping it under control.  All right.  And Danny wants to know how the yacht tasted.  What?  Oh, you're just...  You know, people...  It lingers under.  All right, Pat.  Do what you think.  Excuse me? 
[02:01:30]  Danny.  Are you bleeding?  You can't say that.  Don't put it that way.  All right.  I'm sorry.  God damn.  Don't even ask.  All right.  Yeah, just say yes or no.  All right.  Is she or is she not?  Right.  And you're not, right?  You're not.  All right.  Very good.  That's Michelle C.  Let's come on.  Pat Dumpy today, we'll call you.  No kidding.  Oh, Jesus.  That is so stupid, isn't it? 
[02:02:00]  I've been coming out with some real lemons today.  Oh, my God.  Do I stink?  You.  I just learned to shut up after my first crack.  What?  When we snuck off?  Yuck.  Yuck.  You are really seeing us at our worst.  We got Karina C.  Hi.  In the studio from Clifton, New Jersey.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'7".  5'7".  And what's your nationality?  Peruvian.  Yeah.  You're like that javelin, bro.  No, she's from Paraguay.  Oh, Paraguay.  From Paraguay. 
[02:02:30]  Paraguay.  Do you have a small hiney, madam, if I may ask?  You have to go this way.  I can't see.  Oh.  Thank you.  I'm going to see.  Yeah, could you give us the hiney pose?  Wow.  You got that.  That's fantastic.  Could you stand near Vinny for a second?  I've got to get a picture of the hiney pose.  Vinny's over here.  Who's telling me?  Here.  Bend over.  Exactly.  Everybody wants to know.  I'll be asking that at Trump Marina.  Yeah.  I just did that joke.  Did you?  Yeah.  Very nice.  What do we want to ask Karina?  I don't know. 
[02:03:00]  I think he did.  Self-deprecating.  I don't understand it.  Let's go to Vinny.  Vinny?  A question?  Yeah.  What do you got?  I got very...  Do you eat?  Of course I eat.  Yeah, you look very...  The leg, the lower leg, very, very thin.  Looks like maybe a little anorexia going on.  No, I think it's her Peruvian background.  It could be, but I think this girl more than once shoved a finger down her throat after a fine meal.  Excuse me.  Just telling her what I think.  Yeah, good.  Spunky, good.  How about I had Japanese sirloin steak last night before I went to sleep? 
[02:03:30]  I didn't know what you ate.  It was a throw up.  No, I didn't know.  The girl's beautiful.  Yes, I did say...  That's the best you could do with her?  She's in the number two spot for me.  Again, I take away points for the tattoo.  Tattoos, I don't like.  They're permanent.  Where's the tattoo?  It's right there on the hip.  Okay.  Does your daughter have any tats?  No, I'll kill her.  Well, she'll do whatever daddy doesn't like.  Yeah, I know.  Which is tattoos and bringing home gentlemen that you probably won't enjoy. 
[02:04:00]  Vinny, this is what we're going to do for you and your fine club down there in New Brunswick,  New Jersey, the Stress Factory.  All right, good.  We're inviting your daughter in to get her first tattoo live on the OPN.  Oh, thank you so much.  A tramp stamp.  I appreciate that.  Sponsored by the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  That's what we do for you, my friend.  Thank you.  I really appreciate that.  Your daughter, I've known her many years.  We actually get along well.  Yeah, she liked your book.  Oh, that's scary.  That disturbed me.  That's scary.  Yeah.  Yeah, it bothers me.  I'm telling you.  She'll say, oh, I love Jim Norton.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's the thing you'd never want to hear your daughter say.  That's what I don't want to hear.  I love Jim Norton. 
[02:04:30]  I'm a nice guy.  I'm a good boyfriend.  Not to her.  You'd be dead.  I would kill you.  I have no doubt in my mind.  I would kill you right after a successful weekend at the club.  I would take one more rap out of your tail and then kill you.  How about we talk about the hot piece of ass?  What's wrong with you guys?  Yeah, she's a good looking girl and she's got the bathing suit very well done.  Are they fake?  Yes, they are.  Yeah, they're fake.  You got fake boobs.  Yeah.  How do you not know that?  Well, it could be youth.  No, no.  Those have distinct fake marks, which I, again, take away points. 
[02:05:00]  You got to go with God gave you.  I'm going to guess 34D.  A C cup.  Are they C's?  Yep.  Wow.  Maybe they just look larger on your small frame.  Ah.  Or maybe I'm gay.  All right.  That's very nice.  We like Corinna.  Very sexy.  Corinna.  Thank you.  Yes.  Moving on to Holly Michelle B.  Oh, where's that?  These pictures do not do these girls justice.  Your pictures are horrible. 
[02:05:30]  Corinna, your pictures suck.  Sorry, Mr. Photographer.  You look much better in person.  You're way better in person.  Terrible.  These pictures are awful.  Wow.  All right.  This is Holly Michelle B.  She's some kind of rock.  Wow.  You got some tats on your.  Here's another one where the picture just stinks on ice.  Yeah.  Your pictures sucked.  Yeah.  We didn't even want to talk to you when we saw this picture.  In this picture, they actually highlighted the tattoos.  That's the only thing they.  Yeah.  It's like, take a shot of a tats.  It could have been a biker guy.  Yeah.  You look better in person, we're saying.  Thank you.  Everyone's pictures have come out. 
[02:06:00]  We're not attacking you.  We're attacking the photographer.  Yes.  Yeah.  He's the one taking pictures right now.  I can only imagine what these are going to look like.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  She's probably got the microphone and like half her face obscured.  Nothing?  All right.  Now, whatever.  Well, you know, Vinny's bringing up the tats and stuff also.  What do they signify?  Anything?  Family.  Family.  Family, yeah.  Any.  I hope no tragedies on there.  Obviously come from some type of carnival background.  A couple of tragedies.  Yeah.  I hate tragic tats.  What are the tragic tats?  Which one?  Tragic.  Well, tragedy as in my father passed away, so he's on my left arm. 
[02:06:30]  He's on your left arm or what's on your right arm?  The rest of my family.  Zodiac symbols.  Wait, but they're not tragic.  No.  Oh, okay.  No, but you got the one tragic thing.  Me.  Oh, that's you.  Me in tattoo form.  Oh, right.  Nice.  You got to give her extra points for having her bathing suit bottom really hanging low.  That's barely.  Yeah, there's another little tat there.  Yeah, that's barely covering the you know what there.  Now, how tall are you?  5'1"?  5'1"-ish.  5'1"-ish.  That's 5'1".  Vinny's not going to like your boobs because he likes the big ones. 
[02:07:00]  No.  Do you dance?  Do you dance?  Yes, I do.  How do you not like her?  She's fantastic.  What's that little tattoo above your...  Shamrock.  Oh, because you're Irish?  Oh, hell yeah.  She's got the younger Tara Reade look when Tara Reade was kind of still, you know, hot.  You do?  Have people told you that?  Yes.  A little bit?  Just a less trashier version?  No, you're...  Yeah, yeah.  You know, like the younger version when she was...  Tara Reade never...  Before the move job?  Yeah, before she just fell apart.  But Tara Reade never looked as hot as this girl looked. 
[02:07:30]  Tara Reade looked pretty hot like Josie and the Pussycats.  Yeah, I got to tell you.  But this girl's hot.  I'll give her that.  She's hot.  She's done her hair.  What?  You've done your hair before the competition.  She just looked like she rolled out of bed.  Are you saying you could have done your hair?  Is that your critique?  Her hair's a little musk.  If you're in a competition, you should do your hair.  The girl, the first one, look at her hair.  Done.  See?  What's wrong with the messy do there, Vinny?  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  I just think if you're in a competition, you should try and present your best stuff and  the hair looks a little ratty. 
[02:08:00]  I'm sorry.  I like to just roll out of bed look.  I do, too.  Nice.  Exactly what I did.  Yeah, see?  Courtney loves staring into the coffin hair.  No, that's she was up late working last night.  And, you know, a couple of guys maybe bought you some expensive drinks.  So that's tonight.  Oh, that's tonight.  That happens.  Okay.  And then you fall asleep.  You wake up.  Got to be up early for the show.  So where does she dance?  Where do I dance?  Yeah.  Everywhere. 
[02:08:30]  A bunch of clubs?  Oh, yeah.  I'm also an Irish dancer.  What?  What do you mean?  I'm talking about river dancing.  River dancing stuff?  Yes.  River dancing.  You do?  Yeah.  Can we see a little something?  Something?  Please river dance.  Yeah.  Just do a little river dance.  Oh, God.  I shouldn't have said that.  Come on.  A little river dancing.  Yeah, you probably shouldn't have said that.  How can you be embarrassed to dance two different places for a living?  Just do a little river dance.  I'm not asking you to hit the pole.  Just do a little river dance.  I need music.  Sorry.  What do you need?  Yeah.  What kind of music?  This is a music station.  I need music.  I need clogs. 
[02:09:00]  I need...  No.  No.  Come on.  We got to see a little bit.  God bless that.  He tried.  It all sounds like that anyway.  Well, you need the postures.  I want to see what it is.  We don't know what it is.  15 seconds.  Yeah, of course.  Or you're going to river dance your way out of this studio.  Let's go.  All right.  What's this?  The big buildup? 
[02:09:30]  Are you serious?  Is this Lord of the Dance?  Yeah.  It is Lord of the Dance?  Huh?  I need you to go back on the end.  On the flute?  Yeah, do the flute for her.  I can't do the flute.  It was a joke.  But it was good.  I suck at the flute.  No, you can hear it, right?  It's me doing it right now.  I can hear it.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, she got in position?  No, I'm seriously going to, like, get stuck in here.  It should be fine.  Here it goes.  Oh. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  We got to see that naked.  If you did that naked.  Wow.  You're out of my way.  Very nice.  That's nothing I can do unless I get stuck.  It's okay.  I think you impressed the judges.  Yeah.  And Vinny was very nice to you.  Very nice guy.  I like the personality.  Just the messy hair.  That's the only thing you come up with?  Messy hair and the tats.  I don't like the tats.  People are commenting.  Yeah, but it's for the father.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, the father's fine.  I got to give that.  But for the rest of the family, unnecessary. 
[02:10:30]  Well, she's got, she's a, you know, the tattoo look is very sexy.  I mean, some girls.  It's sexy until you're 30.  So what?  But that's, who wants to bang him after 30?  Jesus Christ.  How are you?  You're eight years too late.  I think she's great.  Thank you.  Yeah, we love you all.  I didn't say you weren't great.  You're fine.  All right.  You know.  She did that in heels, by the way.  She did.  Yeah.  And no one likes a shy go-go dancer.  Yeah.  She does everything in heels.  Everything in heels.  And the river dance, do you like doing it?  Because it's arguably the worst dance ever. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, even though you're good at it, it's a terrible dance.  Nobody enjoys it.  It really is.  An awful dance.  It's a good dance.  You can just throw a little river dance in while you're go-go dancing, just to throw  the guys off.  Sometimes.  You know what the river dance is good for?  If you've been looking at booby-trapped maps in an ammo case and blown your arms off,  you could still dance.  Now, this is important stuff.  This is important.  All right.  Can we, uh, do we have to break here and go, oh, a 22-year-old war movie reference? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  All right.  We're going to break.  How old are you?  No kidding.  A platoon joke.  That's great, though.  We have to break as you guys continue to laugh.  We might lose some of our affiliates.  If we do, you could find out the results on onaradio.com.  Hopefully, some of the affiliates will stick with us.  They certainly will here in New York City.  Yes.  We'll come back live here in New York City on KROQ and maybe on some other stations.  Like I said, if not, go to onaradio.com, and the results will be up there. 
[02:12:00]  We'll continue in just a bit.  Thank you.  She was great.  Holly, right?  Yeah.  Holly Michelle B. from Staten Island.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  No.  What the hell's that?  We're not leaving.  Because we're starting.  Because we're usually gone at this time.  Yeah.  Boston bailed on us.  That's too bad.  Oh, Boston.  We're talking about to play in a week of music while we're on vacation.  It's the best of us.  It's hard.  Why would they bail?  We lost Boston, but that's okay.  We're still live in New York.  We're trying to pick the finalists in the KROQ girl contest, that girls contest, whatever 
[02:12:30]  that has been running for four months on the internet.  And we're down to the last 15 or 16, and we're going to knock it down to eight.  And that'll be the girls you'll see on the streets of New York.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  The next contestant has made her way into the studio.  Jesus.  And, yeah, these pictures, I said it to the girls off mic, these pictures suck.  You're so much hotter in person.  What were you doing?  I'm flabbergasted by these pictures.  What are these pictures that the listeners were looking at online? 
[02:13:00]  Oh, God.  Who took the pictures?  There he is, right there.  You should fire yourself.  God.  You really need to just fire yourself.  I've seen sexier shots taken with the Hubble.  We got Karen R.  We should have had our new governor take the pictures.  Done a better job.  Jesus.  You stink.  She's very pretty.  Hi.  Hi, Karen.  Hi.  Karen R., a lovely Bucksotic, looking to get her place as a KROQ girl. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, you got it.  Wearing a little, what is that, a little leopard skin number?  Yeah, it's a little leopard skin.  Whoa.  Nice cheeks.  And she's giving the other girl a run for her money as far as how low the bottom of the swimsuit is.  Yeah, it's really low, but, you know, it is what it is.  Woo!  Whoa!  She wooed.  We got a woo.  I thought she was pissed off when she came in.  She looked annoyed, but now she's wooed.  No, that's good.  Her body is amazing.  Oh, thank you.  You have a kid?  No, I don't. 
[02:14:00]  No kids?  No.  26 Sagittarius, favorite color, pink, and I love you guys.  What nationality are you?  I'm Israeli.  Oh, cool.  Israeli.  Yeah.  I like that because she's never been pushy.  I like that.  Wow, she is fantastic.  This buxotic Jew with raven hair.  Her dark features, the hair is almost to the belly button.  Israeli, we know Israeli is a little different than your American Jewish girl.  Yeah, but I speak Hebrew. 
[02:14:30]  You do you?  Yeah, I do.  Were you in the army and stuff at like 10?  No, I came here when I was four.  Oh, were you in the army at four?  I know they kind of draft people a little young over there.  Yeah, they do.  They do.  They'll explain it.  Hey, look.  I'm not making any excuses today.  It's Friday.  She looks a little like, what's her name, from Meg on Family Guy, who was, she was in that  other movie.  What?  Huh?  Mila Kunis.  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit. 
[02:15:00]  Vinny, what do you got?  All right, you know, first of all, she's using the hair to hide the, yeah, because they're  small.  She's not hiding them, I don't think.  I think they look good.  I don't think they should look good.  We're just, this is a competition, Jim.  This is the Olympics of...  I think she has the smallest boobs in the contest.  She does.  What are you, Vinny Myers?  What do you need, like, giant?  Like, every girl, he needs to have giant bosoms.  I don't need to have giant...  You're like a matronly woman.  Yeah.  A matronly woman.  Put on an apron and make me cupcakes. 
[02:15:30]  I don't like tattoos.  What a goody gumdrop.  All right, and this, and I don't know if I like the attitude.  I take away points.  The attitude's all right.  No, because she's Jewish, and they become annoying.  That's different.  Yeah, but they become annoying.  They become very hard to deal with over time.  I like Israel.  They're the only ones that like us in that part of the world.  I love the Israelis.  I love the Israeli people, but Israeli women are annoying.  And what about the really tiny bottom there?  She had a tiny bottom, and she's got gladiator sandals on, which I don't... 
[02:16:00]  They're gladiator...  You don't like the gladiator sandals?  No, because how tall are you, five foot?  No, I'm five foot three.  Are you five foot...  You don't look five foot three, but neither here nor there.  You did find the bathing suit's very, very small.  Everything else is good.  I have a question.  Your nice big head of hair is nice and everything.  It's real.  It's real.  It's real.  Oh, go ahead.  I know you're from Israel.  Yeah.  Are you hiding...  Are you hiding any bad things with those feet?  Because they're closed-toed... 
[02:16:30]  No, that is because it's the only high shoe that I have.  I don't really wear high shoes.  I wear flat shoes.  Okay.  So it was the only ones that I had.  Don't you hear how annoying that voice is?  That's an annoying-sounding voice.  So it's an accent.  I'm telling you, I'm taking away points.  I'm bilingual.  That could be the reason why.  I'm bilingual.  I'm just telling you, it's grating on me.  Can you say something in Hebrew?  How about, oh, easy, Jim.  It's too large.  I'm sorry, Jim.  You're trying to do it. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  See?  Fantastic.  Great name.  I love Lucky Louie.  Oh.  He said, we've canceled Lucky Louie.  The worst acting I've ever seen was in...  Oh, I love her.  All right.  Karen's one of my favorites.  How about the...  Will you allow Pat Duffy to do the test?  Which is?  He won't touch you.  He's not going to touch you.  He's going to go by an area that he's then going to sniff to see if it's a certain time. 
[02:17:30]  Okay.  It's easy.  I don't have my period, but hey.  All right.  All right.  Let me be honest with you.  I don't have it.  That's good.  Can I still smell?  Yeah, Pat.  He was going to guess, but...  Pat, get in there.  Oh, my gosh.  He's like, hey.  Oh, Pat.  Oh, it's amazingly good.  Is it?  Yes.  Thank you.  He got to go back door with that.  You got to...  Is it like a knish?  For the girls coming in, I prefer that way to smell.  Potato Lucky. 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  You are married?  No, I'm not married.  She's wonderful.  Thank you.  Okay.  And what do you do for a living?  I'm a teacher.  You're a teacher?  Fifth grade English.  Fifth grade teacher.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hope to see your picture in a newspaper someday.  You are.  Fill that fantasy up.  Wow.  All right.  That's good.  Karen R. from West Ham.  Hi.  Karen R. was good.  Tremendous.  Sure.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Oh, wait.  Do you have a friend named Jennifer?  Jennifer or what?  Well, hold on, man.  Let me see something here.  Jennifer in New York.  Jennifer.  Jennifer Romano. 
[02:18:30]  Yes, my best friend.  Hi, Jen.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  That's what you hear in a bar when you go like, oh, God, I got to go over to that.  Yeah.  I went to ultra annoying.  I went over the top.  Why don't you like me?  I didn't do it.  No, I, you, hold on, Jennifer, you're about, Jen, hold on, this is what happens when you're  trying to hit on a girl like this, then Jennifer comes over, babbles over you, and then she  ignores you, too, and then you stand there like an emasculated zilch and walk away with  your Sprite, because you're an alcoholic.  Go take your hip-hop lessons at 50.  And you wait till 2 a.m. and you pick up that other broad. 
[02:19:00]  You guys have been on a line with my friend.  I'm going to come beat you up.  I'm probably taller than all of you.  How tall are you?  60 feet.  I'm 10.  She looks like Angelina Jolie.  Is she also Israeli?  No, she's Italian.  No, I'm Italian.  All right.  And you got an embarrassing story or something?  What are you doing right now, shaving?  Waxing my belly button.  What's that?  Sorry.  I don't want to eat dinner at my house anymore.  Why?  Ask her why she's not at your...  She is Israeli.  Obviously, she's Jewish, so for Christmas, she comes to my house. 
[02:19:30]  There's 20 people eating dinner.  She's telling a joke, and in front of five-year-olds and six-year-olds, she whispers the word black  man and yells out the word C-O-C-K, and then does it like five times, never realizing  what she's doing.  That's good that you spelled it on the radio.  Yeah, that's it.  The SEC always lets that one go.  They won't dump out of spelling it.  I think it meant you came over and looked at the Christmas tree and just yelled, boo.  What is that?  All right.  Thank you, Jennifer.  The worst story ever. 
[02:20:00]  I know.  Jennifer?  Your phone stinks.  I got rid of it.  Karen.  Did you try to crucify the treetop?  What?  A little top of the tree, mate.  No, I didn't.  You know?  Oh, thank you.  How much did you pay for that?  That's true.  It's a rough one.  We still have five girls to go.  Let's go here.  Dominic M.  I'm firing a lot of rounds, but my accuracy is off today.  It's like the guy from the Riverdance picked that joke up. 
[02:20:30]  Good morning, guys.  Say hi to the lovely Dominic M from Bell Rose, New York.  Are you calling her Dominic?  Did you just call her Dominic?  Not the Christmas song.  Dominic, of course.  I'm Dominic Barbara.  Right.  In your photo, you look like Barry Katz.  Yeah, what the hell?  You look very cute and personal.  I don't know.  You know.  I'm going to pee personally.  These photos stink.  They're horrible.  Yeah, we're all in agreement.  Awful pictures.  We didn't want to do this contest.  We thought we were going to be looking at a lot of pigs. 
[02:21:00]  We absolutely thought it was just going to be awful.  Yeah.  How painful is it now?  You look great.  It's very good.  It's good now.  Yeah.  You look okay now?  Yeah, wonderful little dog tags.  Yeah.  They're my grandpa's.  Are they really?  Yeah, from World War II.  Oh, my God.  Was he a Nazi?  No.  God damn it.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  Son of a...  Oh, no.  I mean, good.  Patriot.  And the bathing suit bottoms are getting lower and lower.  Wow, yeah.  That one's almost hanging open.  That one is not only low, it's not tied properly.  Yeah.  No, that's good. 
[02:21:30]  It's secure.  This girl wants to be a K-Rock girl and make a little money.  I love that bathing suit, by the way.  Only big bills.  What are we looking at, Jimmy, for the radio audience there?  Like a nice gold bikini, right?  Yeah.  Gold.  With a nice...  With the foot of an animal.  Yeah, like a leopard shoe.  Or a camel.  They're furry.  Yes, they are furry.  And her top is a little, I don't know, strapless number there.  It kind of wraps around.  No strap necessary.  Very tight.  Very nice.  No strap necessary.  Here goes Vinny again. 
[02:22:00]  Vinny has a problem.  Obviously, Vinny has a problem.  Vinny, I like big boobs for it.  I don't.  I just...  It doesn't matter.  She doesn't have breasts like a Russian housekeeper.  Hey, don't rack on the naughty bits.  They're fine.  They look good.  They're fine, man.  They're totally proportioned.  Little B's, right?  You don't want giant ones.  They're baby boobs.  Are they kind of A's, maybe?  No.  We're a bountiful B.  You know, it's a little restrictive, the top.  But, you know, do what you can with it.  I like that. 
[02:22:30]  How tall are you?  Five, three and a half.  When you're making out...  I'm really this tall.  Dark hair, dark eyes.  When you're making out and a guy puts his hand up your shirt,  he all of a sudden asks to see your ID.  Actually, yeah.  I walk in a bar, and my 17-year-old sister walks right in,  and I get ID'd at the door for 10 minutes.  Pretty annoying.  Benny, what do you got?  She's a very pretty girl.  She's got a nice figure from just above the belly button down,  and then from the neck up.  Very pretty. 
[02:23:00]  Why, thank you.  You're very welcome.  How about you just say you like everything but her breasts?  I like everything but her breasts.  How about the butt?  What's wrong with them?  It's juicy.  Speaking of, would you mind Pat Duffy doing something, something?  He won't touch you, though.  Oh, God.  He's got to do the...  Is he the sniff guy?  Yeah, he's the sniff guy.  He won't touch.  All right, I think we got an answer already.  I'm armed with pepper spray.  Don't come too close.  Yeah, watch it.  Where's the pepper spray hiding?  My grandpa's a war hero.  He coughs and it shoots you in the face.  Ready?  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:30]  Just relax.  Are you...  No.  Okay.  But you know what?  He didn't even guess.  He asked.  There wasn't any...  Why weren't there any comments like, wow, nice?  I was contemplating.  It's like a fine wine.  You have to...  It's a contemplating person.  You're one for whatever we have here.  It's not like a fine wine.  I got this job.  All right, let's move on.  She's very nice.  All right, Dominique.  Dominique.  Thank you very much. 
[02:24:00]  All right, we're going to have a tough choice here today.  I like that we're all very surprised when they come in because the pictures are so awful.  Wow, wait.  Hello.  Hi.  How are you?  Yeah, and yourself?  Kimmy.  It's Kimmy.  Yes.  Kimmy D from West Babylon.  Mm-hmm.  So you have a lot of piercings, it looks like.  Your nose, your lip.  That I do.  Other things?  Anything else?  No, that's it.  No?  That's it.  Go through the speech like Roseanne Arquette in Pulp Fiction.  Wow. 
[02:24:30]  I didn't even.  Well, she gives all her piercings in that movie and she runs through quite a list of  places that she's pierced.  All right.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Jesus.  That's, um...  Holy Jesus.  I'm going to be leaving right now.  I don't seem to be contributing anything to the program.  That's not true.  I just, uh...  This girl, I just want to get my eyebrows waxed and my nails done.  You look like a manicurist.  That's all I can think of.  Oh, God damn.  Your mom is?  Of course she's a manicurist. 
[02:25:00]  What are her career options?  Yankee Cranky?  Or, uh...  Or sushi.  And you actually have big breasts for an Asian girl, which is...  I'm sorry.  She's very cute.  The problem is the bathing suit, though.  It looks like a casino rug or something.  She's also untung.  You need to do...  That's the type of rug you drop your chips on and you can't find them anymore.  Could I...  Could we...  I like the shoes, though.  The shoes are kind of sexy.  Yeah, again, the lace-up, the calf thing. 
[02:25:30]  Very sexy.  Thank you.  I like that.  Can we see your hiney?  But it's not because we...  Nice.  Okay.  And, yeah, the bathing suit...  That's good.  We're going to take you to go with a sexier number.  I don't think the bathing suit shows you off as well.  Yeah, yeah.  See, because I'm seeing some, you know, some curve there that isn't accentuated by the swimsuit.  Okay.  Yeah.  You're very pretty.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Kimmy D, everyone.  I think you're being done in by your clothes. 
[02:26:00]  That blows.  But, yeah, see what happens.  That does blow.  I'll give you that.  That's just an opinion, though.  I kind of like...  It is an opinion.  I like Kimmy D.  We got a lot of judges here.  Don't you worry.  What am I, a fashion expert?  Yeah.  All right, let's go with...  Let's go with Christy C. from Brooklyn.  We got to kind of move through this.  Yeah, I know.  We're running out of time.  Because we still got to go over to the other joint.  We got people waiting for us at the other joint today.  Christy C. from Brooklyn.  Tats are very popular.  Hey, what's going on?  Hi.  Another tatted up girl. 
[02:26:30]  Look at that.  Vinny's loving that.  What do you have, the tattoo?  What's on the right lower calf?  It's a skull.  Cool.  And what's on the stomach?  Black heart.  Yeah, it looks like you went to a discount tattoo parlor.  Thank you.  Jesus.  We can't...  Whatever.  We can't afford color.  Whatever.  She just wrote you off.  I know.  Whatever, Vinny Brandt.  The girl wants to come in here with Merchant Marine tattoos.  She's allowed to...  Jesus.  We can't please Vinny because the boobs are a little bigger like you'd like. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  But now you got the problem with the tattoos.  That's actually good work on her leg.  We got a very...  Wow.  The other one, you got to admit, the other one's a little rough.  Yeah.  Wow.  The one right there is a little...  You ought to have something else done around that one.  Yeah.  Kind of fix it up.  I'll work on it.  Was that a party one night?  Out there in Brooklyn.  Where are you from?  Brooklyn?  Brooklyn.  Williamsburg.  Oh, right on.  Williamsburg.  You have kids?  No kids.  No kids.  Blonde hair.  How tall?  5'2".  5'2".  And how old?  29.  Why the black heart?  Got a jet black heart. 
[02:27:30]  Are you really...  You seem kind of like a melancholy, depressive girl.  Jesus.  She has a skull and a black heart.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to come to that conclusion.  What's on the wrist?  What's on the wrist?  Is that the thorns around the wrist?  It's a star.  It's a what?  It's a bracelet.  Stars.  A bracelet.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  If you treat a guy right, you get a bracelet for free.  You have to tap to one on your wrist.  Yeah, that hurts.  Why are you so hurtful? 
[02:28:00]  I'm just...  All right.  Okay.  Christy C. from Brooklyn, everyone.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  We're still running out of time.  That's why we're taking less and less time with the girls.  I think we just already found our winner.  Kiara M. from Brooklyn.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, sure.  Put that on.  Okay.  Wow.  Okay, Xena.  There's a lot going on with this outfit.  There's a lot happening.  You want to describe the outfit there, Vinny?  Yeah.  Well, it's a purple hair indicative of a desire to be noticed at all times. 
[02:28:30]  She's got the little schoolgirl things on that, again, Infantina would love.  Very, might I say, almost whore-like.  What?  Leg warmers, you mean?  I do not like the leg warmers.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't like that.  The whole outfit, I don't like.  The bathing suit.  With black thigh-high, not the knee-high socks.  The arm warmers on her leg.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  I love that.  I don't like them.  I think it's nice.  Sort of a, you know, red show.  Why the purple hair?  What's with the purple hair? 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  I just like purple.  Color of love.  You get along with your father?  Huh?  I do, actually, yeah.  Yeah.  And he looks at the purple hair and says, that's great.  Yeah.  All right.  You're bringing the parental things again.  No, because that, to me, this whole outfit says-  Did your parents go to the PTA meetings?  No, this whole outfit says, I'm mad at my father, in my head.  Really?  In your head?  In my head, yes.  She's got the tattoo, the purple hair.  I hope your daughter comes home dressed just like that someday.  Those are the type of girls we like.  My daughter's done it.  My daughter, yeah. 
[02:29:30]  You don't want girls with healthy father relationships.  No.  I'm the father completely out of the picture.  The deader, the better, I say.  What are your tattoos of?  Um, this is a decapitated biomechanical pinup girl.  A what?  A decapitated?  Biomechanical pinup girl.  You ever see those kind of robotic looking, looks like nose art from an old World War II 
[02:30:00]  plane, but they're kind of futuristic?  Yeah, but anything decapitated tattooed on your body, that's just an anger.  It could be.  And that's not the girl you want to marry.  You can't sleep comfortably.  I think we're just picking K-Rock girls, not brides here.  It's okay.  There was a picture of her on the website where you had like, uh, you know, your mouth  was gagged and stuff.  Do you like that?  Getting gagged?  Yeah.  Um, sure.  I like both sides, so.  What's the other side?  Oh, giving it and taking it, right?  Suck on shit.  Whoa.  Whoa, hey. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Hold on, now let's discuss this.  Jim just woke right up.  Now we could be looking for a bride.  I think Jimmy's, Jimmy's interested.  Well, so you're, you kind of switched.  You're like submissive and you're also dominant?  Yeah.  So when you say, we have to be careful how we say this on the radio.  When you say you like guys making suck on things, let's just say.  My heel of my shoe.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  What a, are you a dom?  Huh?  Are you a dom?  Are you in the business?  Are you a dominatrix?  Business, no.  Just in your personal life?  Jimmy wants to know if you, Jimmy wants to know if you wear the special belt. 
[02:31:00]  Chastity belt?  No, no, no, no.  Let's say this.  Like picture, picture wearing a belt that most guys would run away from.  Right.  With a buckle that looks like Snuffleupagus.  You like spanking guys?  Yeah.  Have you done, really?  You ever spit in somebody's mouth?  Maybe.  Nice.  After a little cigarette, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Sturdy.  Oh, yeah.  She's a trooper.  She's great.  I'm not even a submissive. 
[02:31:30]  Is there anything you want to do with her, Jimmy, that you're allowed to do?  I don't know.  What'd you eat yesterday?  No, I'm kidding.  No, I like her.  I think she's a tall girl, too.  You want to take some spit in the mouth or anything like that?  I don't know.  I'm just thinking out loud here.  I can't take spit in the mouth.  We don't know each other.  Are you a boyfriend married?  Can you spank one of our guys?  Sure.  Duffy's up.  All right, Duffy.  You got to bend over my leg.  All right.  Yeah, go over her leg.  All right, hold on, Duffy.  This is the best day ever.  Best day ever, Duffy's saying. 
[02:32:00]  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  We got to mic it up and everything.  Best day ever.  All right, here we go.  This is.  Oh, jeez.  Or how about a bare-bottom?  Yeah, pull your pants down.  Yeah, bare-bottom.  You fruit.  Yeah, bare-bottom.  Oh, God.  Look at that little Irish nothing thing.  You're embarrassing.  Lick your hand first.  She doesn't want to lick her hand after she's been slapping his... 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  All right.  She's a trooper.  I'm at the Trump marina on Saturday night.  Oh, God.  Are you, Vinny?  I'm at the Trump.  Just let everyone know your hot daughter's going to be there.  You'll see how.  Duffy just...  Wait, he wants her to spin...  No.  Duffy moved into second place in my competition.  Duffy just, like, pretty much showed himself to a room full of attractive girls and showed  nothing.  He was completely... 
[02:33:00]  He was acorning.  You're a minimalist when it comes to that, huh?  Growing up, show her.  They don't even say that.  That's why everyone...  That is the biggest lie everyone says, because they know you're not going to be seen in the  grown position by most anybody.  I don't get complaints.  Iraq, would you let us...  You don't get complaints?  No.  All these girls laughed when they saw it.  When you pay a girl, she never complained.  This is the reaction I'm used to, but it changes over time.  All right.  Listen.  That's true.  From pity to revulsion to leaving you.  Steven asks for Basher, wants to know if she could slap Iraq's belly. 
[02:33:30]  Could you take a belly slap from her, Iraq, for the team?  How about a punch?  How do you not like this girl?  I know.  She wants to punch Iraq.  I love her.  I love her.  All right.  Can I punch him?  Iraq.  Wait, punch him where?  That mess.  I can punch him?  Yeah, in the stomach.  If he's okay with it.  Wait.  This is how Houdini died.  Good luck getting you.  Do you know how to...  Good luck getting you.  Punch him in the place normally piglets would be suckling. 
[02:34:00]  Wait, wait.  Not as hard as you can.  Not too hard.  Wait, you don't have rings on.  Holy crap.  She's...  Houdini.  Oh, she...  Oh, man.  Can she punch?  Oh, did she wail him?  Oh, my God.  You're right, Iraq.  Yeah, that hurt.  God, she can punch.  What's the tattoo on the back?  It's a bloody lotus flower.  Oh, man.  I'd like to apologize for my comment about your hair. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, that's pretty good.  What nationality?  Yeah, we got past the hair real fast here.  What nationality?  I'm an Irish Italian.  Oh, she's great.  Yeah, that's a hell of a temper Irish Italians get.  Wow.  And she's pretty much just about naked.  We just about saw all your boobs and your punches.  Yeah, she's wearing material just draped over her slightly.  How many of the girls desperately want to show their boobs off today?  Desperately.  No one?  Are you...  No, there's a few.  They really want to, but they know they got to keep it kind of safe for this dumb station. 
[02:35:00]  You ever make guys kiss your feet and stuff?  I'm just curious.  I'm just saying...  Uh, yeah.  Nice.  All right, we're going to do more with Kiara.  It's tough to find a good dominant girl.  We're not sure if you're going to win the contest, but you certainly have a place on our radio show, so.  Punching E-Rock.  E-Rock, is this me?  Do you got a mark yet?  Yeah, let's see your belly.  She bullseyeed his belly button.  There's a fist mark right on his belly button.  Just knuckles. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, wow.  This girl can replace Mr. Poe.  Your security girl.  How did it feel when your fist sunk into his...  The what?  How did it feel punching his stomach?  It felt pretty good.  Yeah?  Oh, she was a lot of anger at men.  Well, that was fantastic, right?  We'll be seeing a lot of her, hopefully.  Yeah, and let's say hi to...  Thank you.  Let's say hi to the last contestant, Tammy B. from Bloomingdale, New Jersey.  Here comes Tammy.  See you again.  Another one where the picture does you no justice.  Thank you.  I like the little frilly number. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, these pictures...  You got the little frilly...  Just awful.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  What's the pattern?  Strawberries?  Yeah.  Yeah, very nice.  Strawberries.  And it's that bikini bottom that's got the frills like she's seven at Jones Beach.  Yeah, that's definitely the child monster bathing suit right there.  That's the one that caused all the problems.  Got a centralized lip magician that might be interested in making your bathing suit disappear.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  But she's not hiding anything.  It's just a...  No, no.  A fine...  That's good.  That's very good. 
[02:36:30]  Again, another tat.  One on the foot.  I don't think you saw that, Vinny.  I want to point it out so you can unleash your anger.  A big star.  Attached girls.  It's a flower.  It's a flower.  It's a flower.  Any other tats anywhere?  And a crown.  Oh, a crown on your wrist and a flower on your foot.  Yep.  Nothing around back?  No.  No?  Okay.  And how tall are you?  I'm 5'2".  5'2".  Yeah.  Very nice.  5'2".  Where the hell are you from?  Dark hair.  Down to the boobs.  You like the boobs there, Vinny?  You know, again, a lot like the girls. 
[02:37:00]  My big problem, again, with the hair.  You've got to do something with the hair.  Like maybe...  What's wrong with the hair?  It's just there.  It's parted and straight.  It's just...  It's just there.  You want a little work out of the hair.  What do you...  But that's like just straight hair that's parted.  It's fine.  That's exactly what I said.  Well, it's just...  What do you look...  Not like a mohawk, no?  No, not a mohawk.  Just like...  What do you want?  The Jennifer Aniston?  See, this girl here, again, the first girl, she's got a nice hairdo.  Hairdo.  Stop saying hairdo, you old lady.  See, that's just... 
[02:37:30]  That's what I was going for, and I hope you would hang yourself with a word like hairdo.  Should they all go to the parlor and get a hairdo?  Yeah.  Look.  Look.  All I'm saying is, that girl...  That girl...  Nice job.  This girl, just...  Do something with the hair.  Who do you want her to look like?  Mom's Mabley?  No.  That looks a little mom-like to me.  Just straight.  You know, something like maybe Farrah.  Yeah.  What do you want?  That's nothing wrong with Farrah.  I like that.  That's a kind of feather do.  A feather do? 
[02:38:00]  A little highlight?  Not purple, but something?  Tammy, how old are you?  24.  Oh, 24.  24, Vinny?  Yeah.  You shouldn't look like a mom.  No.  The hair just...  That's...  I don't see much wrong with you.  Yeah, sure.  I know.  There's nothing wrong with having hair like Steven Van Zandt.  I would have done it.  Jesus.  Yeah, nice smile.  I like the smile.  Thanks.  All right.  Can you do a little spin?  See?  That's...  You see?  Yeah.  She has no problem there at all. 
[02:38:30]  Maybe that's why she doesn't bother with the hair.  Mm-hmm.  Because everything else is...  We have 16 girls, right?  Yeah.  15.  How many of these girls are hotter than your daughter?  None.  Oh.  She just had all of them.  Ah.  A father's inappropriate love.  My daughter is...  She's...  I know what she is.  She's a gorgeous girl.  So are my girls.  P-O-A, they call it.  Vinny, we have a last minute entry in this contest.  It's my daughter, I swear to God.  We have a last minute entry.  We have a last minute entry.  We have a last minute entry.  We have a last minute entry.  If it's my daughter, get Poe in here.  We have a last minute entry in the contest.  People will get hurt.  We have a last minute entry.  It better not be. 
[02:39:00]  This better not happen.  We have a last minute entry.  Danielle, if you're out there, I'm telling you, stay out there.  And if that kid goes near my kid, I'll tell you, I will murder you.  Do you know?  Maybe you can then sniff.  No, I will not be sniffing.  No, don't, don't.  Are you ready for the last minute entry, Vinny?  The surprise last contestant.  She better be wearing something big.  Tammy, very nice, by the way.  Last minute entry coming into the city.  If that kid goes near her. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  I want to be a K-Rock girl.  I swear to God, I had my heart in my throat for fun.  Is this going to be my swan song in this show?  Yeah, it would have been.  We know.  Vinny, what do you think of our last contestant?  She decided not to wear a bathing suit.  You would have been great doing radio in the 40s.  She did.  She says our boss.  Is that who that is?  I thought it was Ricky Gervais. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  That's the boss.  That's our boss.  She signs the checks.  Mara.  Am I in or what?  Yeah, that's Mara.  She's our boss.  I'll tell you my height is six foot.  The weight you're not hearing about.  Six foot.  But one of the pluses, she likes to down a few beverages.  Yeah.  I like that.  Yeah.  I can see you in the gutter somewhere with that little mask on.  She's professional.  You can tell who doesn't get a paycheck from CBS radio.  General manager. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Is that the general manager?  Yes.  Of this very station.  Very nice young lady.  I like your breasts.  You're perfect.  Where'd you get the math?  The Overlook Hotel Party?  That's cool.  1980.  Great party.  That bad Tom Cruise movie.  What was that called?  Oh, yeah.  That dumb movie.  I can't think of it.  All right.  Well, I...  A new level of the lesbian couch, I see.  Yeah, yeah.  Just four girls sitting there. 
[02:41:00]  The fact that you went with...  Instead of a tattoo on your foot, you went with the bunions.  I like that.  I mean, why?  You're absolutely right.  Why?  You're absolutely right.  Maura, would you make out with one of these girls?  No.  Absolutely not.  Just for the show.  No, thanks.  Can I hug you, though?  No.  Oh, yeah.  I want to let a girl hug you.  Hug Maura.  No.  Please.  Hug her.  Hug her.  Hug her.  Would you have the girl on the purple hair punch your mask?  Wait, the Israeli girl.  Why did you want to hug her?  Yeah, why do you want to hug her? 
[02:41:30]  I don't know her.  That's how is where I grow up.  They're annoying.  Go to the mic.  Do you want to hug her because she's her or you just need a hug?  No, I just wanted to hug her.  She reminds me of my bumpka.  Okay, thank you very much.  All right.  I want to thank Maura.  Thank you, Maura.  We'll consider you for the contest.  I want to thank Maura for wrecking an otherwise really good bit.  Wow.  All right, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to announce the finalists and  get the hell out of here. 
[02:42:00]  You just saw Vinny naked.  That was Vinny.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That would have been ugly.  Yeah, yeah.  He really was panicky.  Well, yeah, I'm going to tell you.  There's a point where Vinny doesn't play.  I'm not stupid.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not stupid.  She came on the show one time.  I was very upset with that.  I happened to be very nice to her.  Yeah, we all were.  Actually, I got to tell you something funny.  This is what she said to me.  She goes, you know, I went on the show and she goes, it was the worst five minutes of  their show ever because they were being so nice that listeners hated it.  But I was appreciative that you were all just being vultures. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  You're all being vultures.  Trying to be nice.  She loves the show.  So the girls are staying in, right, for this, of course?  Yeah.  Now we just got to, like, stare at them during the break and make our final...  Oh, probably we have to get eight yeses, right?  Yeah, we need eight.  Because I think I have five or six yeses.  All right, let's get our names together.  We have to tabulate.  Yeah, we'll tabulate.  Quick break and we'll finish up with this.  And then we are going to move over to XM.  I think there's people over there waiting for our show over there.  So it might be a long day today. 
[02:43:00]  Opie and Anthony stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We announce the winners of the K-Rock Girl Contest.  Should we do...  We have a little confusion because the pictures are so, like, non-represented to the girls.  Right.  We actually can't match some of them up.  Right.  Should we, a little bit, do some of the definite yeses first and move them over?  So then we'll know exactly who we have left.  So I know we had a couple we weren't sure about. 
[02:43:30]  Okay.  How about definite?  It's easier because this weekend we can always look.  How about definite yeses and E-Rock has to pick a definite no?  All right.  Vinny Brand from the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  But he's not here promoting that.  He's promoting the fact that he's going to be at...  Trump Marina.  Saturday.  Tomorrow night.  Greg Fitzsimmons tomorrow night.  Okay, very good.  Thanks, man.  Vinny, you did a great job today.  Thank you very much.  You really did.  We finally found something you could do on this radio show.  That's right.  Look for grandmotherly breasts on the... 
[02:44:00]  All right.  So what are we going to do?  I think we should have the definite yeses.  Because there's a couple we weren't too sure about.  So I think the definite yeses should move.  Just because we got confused because the pictures, we couldn't match up with some of these.  They're all holding hands.  They're really into this.  They don't know what to do.  Toss, this is like...  Oh my God.  They're holding hands.  How many minutes do we have?  A few minutes.  Five, ten minutes.  All right.  So can we just start like just... 
[02:44:30]  The first one...  Well, how about you guys huddle?  Over there.  Huddle?  Yeah, make sure you're picking the definites now.  I know some of these.  Yeah, we went through these.  All right.  Lisa?  Yeah.  Lisa H.  Where's Lisa H?  She was the first girl who came in.  Lisa H.  You have to say no.  We have to say no.  She's a yes.  Could she slide?  Oh, she's...  Yeah, just so we know.  Okay.  Yeah, you're...  Yeah, all right.  Lisa H. 
[02:45:00]  Holly Michelle B.  Yes, girl.  Yes.  That's the yes.  That's the definite yeses.  Two?  Yeah.  Kiara M.  You punched Erock in the stomach and you have large breasts.  I mean, but what are you doing?  Just walk.  Of course.  Of course.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And Karen R.  Yeah.  We had to say yes.  Yes. 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  All right.  Pudges against Italians.  Stay in age.  And we had, I think, Stacey F as a yes.  Oh, great.  All right, good.  Yeah, no, I'm just...  Just...  Yes, yes.  We're tabulating.  Do you have that, too, in?  Yes.  Well, Vinny, did you have any of these girls as yeses today?  I had...  I did...  Well, you know, I did not have the purple-haired girl as a yes, because I'm afraid of her.  Yeah.  And if I...  I am.  I had that girl as a yes.  Hold on.  Hold on, we just should do the four... 
[02:46:00]  The deafening yeses first.  These are fine for deafening yeses.  Yeah, now we got to separate them so we could, like...  So now where's the...  See how the broad's over this stuff.  Oh, God.  Oh, there's some pretty girls left over.  Jesus.  Now we got a problem.  Okay, now there's a couple.  All right.  We have Stacey, Karen, Kiara, Holly, Lisa.  There's five.  We need three more.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Now, where's E-Rock?  E-Rock.  There you go, E-Rock.  Oh, the hat backwards.  I like that, kid. 
[02:46:30]  That's anger.  And then he puts it right around forward.  E-Rock, you get to tell two girls no.  Two no's.  Okay.  Let's see.  Oh, man.  Being judged.  Wait, wait, wait, E-Rock.  Before you do that, can we see your belly again?  It's got to be really red by now.  Oh, my God.  Still a little pink.  I want you girls that are being told no to punch her in the face.  I feel comfortable that you're being told no with a man that has a belly like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well said. 
[02:47:00]  Vinny actually likes his breasts.  Yeah.  And they're too big.  Two cellulity.  E-Rock.  Well, if we're going to compare by bellies, then Michelle C., I'm sorry.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  What?  See, I had her in.  What?  She did a good job.  She took the verbal beating.  I like the spunk to do it.  E-Rock, why are you saying no to her?  She's very disappointed.  She seems very nice, but for a K-Rock girl, it's all about in the looks and the presentation. 
[02:47:30]  So, I'm thinking there's some better choices here than Michelle.  Plus, he's afraid that she'll eat the entire buffet and he'll get nothing.  You're a heavy guy yourself.  Who are you kidding me?  We got it, Vinny.  Way to hurt feelings.  No, it hurt feelings.  That was a shot at him, not you.  That's fun.  That's nice.  I meant he was fat, not you.  Well, I just think that I like that girl.  I think she did a good job.  She made it a long way in the competition.  She was in my definites.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Because of the big boobies?  No, she was in my definites because she had a lot of poise and I gave her a beating and  she liked it.  Whatever.  Her dad helped her with her homework and she said, thanks.  Shut up.  You're in my definites.  We got to move on.  Cloverfield, you're out.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, seven, though.  I'm impressed.  Oh, seven.  It's like I'm walking on sunshine.  Jesus.  Okay, that's a no.  I'm sorry, Michelle. 
[02:48:30]  I, uh...  Could you step back?  I'm sad.  Not to be a jerk.  We just have to separate people so we know who's who.  Yeah.  All right, E-Rock, you get to say goodbye to somebody else.  Well, this round's a little tougher, but I'm going to have to go with Kimmy.  What?  Jeez.  All right.  Now, what's the reasoning there?  Oh, look, a couple of the girls.  They're kind of crying.  You're not holding hands.  Well, we have to get rid of some.  What are we...  No, we don't.  She's smiling a lot, though.  You all right?  Kimmy.  Yeah, no, I'm good.  I'm using a stripper pole.  Okay. 
[02:49:00]  I got to tell you, your bathing suit, man.  We think the bathing suit hurt.  I might have, yeah, done you in.  Okay, so we have to find a couple...  Three to go.  Three to go.  Three more yeses, right?  Three more yeses.  Let's force somebody else to knock somebody out.  I think one should be impeached.  All right, how about Kenny?  We'll pick the next one that has to go.  All right.  No, I think one of the winners should be impeached.  What does that mean?  Wait, why?  You don't like...  I think the one in the green should go. 
[02:49:30]  You don't like...  Why?  What's wrong with you?  Are you out of your gourd?  I don't like...  I like the tree broads on the better.  On the left better.  On the better?  Yeah.  Good.  No, she's not being...  The tree broads on the better.  Yeah.  You see them three?  Yeah, we do.  Right there.  That's good.  All right, but Kenny, out of the ones that are remaining, hoping to get picked, which  one do you want to say goodbye to?  The mother from Staten Island.  God, I completely disagree.  I disagree, too, by the way.  I think she is fantastic. 
[02:50:00]  I like it.  I kind of like the fact that she had two kids and she still looks really good, man.  She's sexy.  But, I mean, if it's up to Kenny, it's up to Kenny.  But I...  God damn it.  I had her as a definite yes, and then somebody else disagreed, and then I had to go to a  maybe.  But I think she's fantastic.  You barely...  You almost made it, actually.  All right.  Stunt Brain, you want to knock one out?  Sorry.  Stunt Brain's going to knock one out.  You're all winners, but the black... 
[02:50:30]  Shut up!  The black heart has to go for me.  Oh, that's the one that you don't...  Oh, my God.  Why?  Because you also wrote no.  Oh, damn.  Was I supposed to say?  I'm a good cop today, idiot.  Didn't you read the calendar?  Damage.  All right, well...  How about...  I got to say, it was very confusing for me, because I wrote more yeses than anybody else.  Yeah, Anthony pretty much wrote 13 yeses. 
[02:51:00]  I wrote a lot of yeses.  We need eight.  Because, yeah, I mean, very attractive girls.  All right, Danny, you want to knock one out?  Knock one out or pick one?  Knock one out.  Knock one out.  Like, knock one out, like, physically?  All right.  What do you mean?  Join the club, Danny.  Join the bomb club.  I've been there for a while.  At least I have some company.  We got seven girls left.  We got to pick three.  So, Danny, who are you going to knock out?  And why?  And why? 
[02:51:30]  I think I have to...  And this is going to be...  This is tough for me, because she was in my original top eight.  Oh, Christ.  Can they move up?  I'm not...  Just the six that are still up?  They're basically the ones...  Oh, we're down to six, actually.  Yes.  Six, okay.  We got to pick three.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  They're all holding their tummies in, I notice.  They're all, like, doing whatever it takes.  Hey, camera guy, why the hell are you filming Danny when there are girls over here? 
[02:52:00]  We rarely get this opportunity.  Yeah, at this point, if they had any, their pubic hair would be showing.  What the fuck if they had any?  I don't know.  I'm questioning Israeli.  She might have some.  Oh, yeah.  You...  No.  No?  Nice.  So glad he picked you.  Nice.  Love the Israeli.  Got to spend 12 hours a day inside just to keep that under control.  No pubic hair, but future back hair.  Oh, God.  Oh, Vinny.  There's nothing back there. 
[02:52:30]  Look.  All right, Danny.  Danny.  Danny, you get to say no to one.  Danny.  It's tough.  I think I'm going to go, and excuse me, because I don't remember her name, but third in from  our left.  Christ, what?  I think it's done.  Not Gold Bikini?  No, her.  No, no, no.  Next to her.  What?  From the Bronx?  The Golden Black.  Yeah, Bronx girl.  What?  What's your name?  Angela?  Yeah.  Wow.  Sorry, Angela.  Oh, man.  I disagree with that one.  Yeah.  False.  That was one of my yeses. 
[02:53:00]  Jeez.  Yeah.  All right.  I didn't get it.  We got five left.  Yeah.  How about, can we pick another one that's in?  Okay.  To make the news a little better?  We need three.  We need three more.  Three.  And you and Jimmy, in agreement, who do you want to pick?  Can I?  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, God.  Let's huddle in the men's room for five minutes.  Whoever has to eat the cracker doesn't get to pick.  All right.  A little guy's joke.  Hooah.  All right.  Can we ask, can we, yeah, this is an odd. 
[02:53:30]  How about you, yeah, look at all their hineys.  I know where you're going, Jimmy.  No, no.  Can we ask.  No?  Everyone.  What?  To, uh, to, now this is a weird thing.  So lean forward and just touch your toes very slowly.  Please.  If you would.  Go.  I don't get it, but.  Now stand up.  Okay.  Cool.  All right.  Okay, we have to pick a yes.  Anything else, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Jumping jacks.  What are they?  Calisthenics, Jacqueline?  What do they want?  I just wanted to cop a peek.  Oh, okay. 
[02:54:00]  The girl in the whole bikini.  What's your name?  Dominique.  All right, Dominique.  You're in.  Yeah, Dominique's in.  Definitely.  Her brazen suit's about to fall off.  What do you think I want everybody to touch their toes for?  Yeah, I know.  The hiney on her.  It's all loose and.  All right.  I mean, the bikini.  That's good.  We got four girls, two spots left?  Yep.  All right, you got to knock another one out.  Two spots left.  Vinny, why don't you knock one of the girls out?  I'm a funny girl.  I'm a little girl in the pink.  This is bad.  This is bad having Vinny do it. 
[02:54:30]  Really?  Because he's going to screw this whole thing up.  Yeah, exactly.  I know he's going from another one of my guesses.  All right.  Who are you knocking out?  The girl next to the girl in the pink.  Ah, I liked her a lot, actually.  I liked them all.  They're all very nice girls.  I have to knock one out.  The job I have to do.  Wait, why are you knocking her out?  Dana.  Yeah, she's.  All right.  Well, thank you, Dana.  All right.  What?  All right.  Three girls left.  We got two spots left.  Oh, wow.  Two spots.  Three girls left.  It's very obvious.  So you got to throw someone out. 
[02:55:00]  At this point, it's very obvious which two.  We have to.  What?  No.  Holy.  It's not.  You're terrible.  We have to pick a yes.  I could be very sex attracted to all three of these girls.  How about.  All right.  We got three girls left.  What's your names?  Lisa.  Marie.  All right.  Why don't we all write down who the last two should be?  Lisa, Tammy, and.  Karina.  Karina.  Okay.  So it's Lisa, Tammy, Karina.  Right?  Everyone write down two names on a piece of paper. 
[02:55:30]  And someone tabulates.  Where's my pen?  Everyone remember the names?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Now hold on.  Tandem into Stunt Brain.  That's what I want.  Very tough.  Hand in your votes, please.  Who's the one in the middle?  Who's the one in the middle again?  Tammy.  Hang on, hang on.  Tammy.  How do you spell Tammy?  Just pick two.  Two out of the three.  All right.  Here's mine. 
[02:56:00]  Let's make it fast.  All righty.  There's new Metallica to play.  All right.  Yeah.  Here you go.  That's there.  All right.  Yep.  Would you keep these things closed?  It's a secret ballad.  Yep.  Come on.  Give it to them.  All right.  And Stunt Brain, you announced the last two K-Rock girls.  And all the pictures and everything will be up on onaradio.com?  Many are up right now.  Many are up right now. 
[02:56:30]  Okay.  And I got to say, everyone's picture sucked.  Yeah.  These girls are so much hotter in person.  All of them are so much hotter.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Very good.  Even the fat one.  What?  You know, there's no reason.  What's Vinny writing?  Unbelievable.  He wrote names, but...  So, too nasty.  What is...  Oh, who is that?  Oh, it's Danny.  Oh, Danny.  Yeah, I couldn't remember their name.  Okay.  All right.  Jesus.  All right.  How are we doing?  Star of Memento over there. 
[02:57:00]  I know.  He just has it.  Woman, I hate one.  Woman, I hate two.  Woman, I hate three.  He's just bummed all the girls are under the age of 50.  Why?  Hey, welcome.  That's like...  This room's getting a little crowded.  Wait a minute.  That's a linger longer from yesterday where he, like, dated the old broad.  We get it.  Oh.  Oh, it's a bit of a blur.  Oh, wow. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  How do we do this?  We got to just pick two names and get out of here.  Well, Tammy's in.  Tammy's in.  Congratulations.  Yes.  Little frilly strawberry bikini.  Yeah, I think...  I think that helped you out.  I think the bathing suit put you over the top.  That looks pretty good.  Right, Vinny?  Yes.  The bathing suit was nice.  Like that.  And I think we know where I went with the last two here.  And by one vote...  One vote.  Oh, my God.  One vote.  Karina is in.  Oh, wow.  You're in.  The agony of truth.  All right. 
[02:58:00]  And, oh, by one vote.  Close margin.  Okay.  I'm not mad.  That's okay.  If any of these girls cannot hold up their end of being a K-Rock girl or get arrested...  Basically, Anthony's saying when one of these girls gets pregnant, then you're in.  I'll be calling all my date rapist friends tonight.  Honestly, I thought you should be in.  Thanks, Ope.  I don't like Ope's new nice guy thing.  I like it.  He's been very nice all day.  Yeah, let's make nine K-Rock girls.  Can we have nine?  Can we have nine? 
[02:58:30]  Where's Mara?  Is she drinking?  I don't know if we're...  To be honest with you...  We were supposed to go in the beginning.  I don't know if we're allowed to change the rules last minute.  I don't know if we're allowed to.  Ask Pete.  It's your show.  Yeah, it is our show.  It's not our station.  What rules?  And there's certain rules we have to follow, which have nothing to do with it.  How about we just have all the girls?  Is he finding out?  Huh?  Which means this was a complete waste of time.  I don't like that.  I'm still very bummed about the mom from Staten Island.  That one...  Get her off her Budweiser.  Get her in here.  Everyone has their couple of favorites that I think she can get in.  I really thought she should get in.  Opinions are like AIDS. 
[02:59:00]  Everyone has it.  I really thought she should have been in, though, man.  I deserve more.  Of course.  Once they're in, they don't feel obligated to laugh, do they?  We'll never talk to them again.  Do we ever have use of the K-Rock girls for our events and stuff?  Of course.  We will.  Okay.  We have top priority.  No, the purple-haired girl is going to be on our show.  That's obvious.  Anybody else have any talents that they can bring to the Opinion Anthony show?  I can birth the alphabet.  Birth the alphabet.  Wow.  That's terrific.  That's something remarkably odd about that. 
[02:59:30]  Because you know she's like a party girl.  That was great.  All right.  Wow, that was terrific.  Anthony likes you because he can picture you vomiting into his toilet while he's kneeling behind you.  Now count to ten in queefs.  Kaboom.  Should we get out of here?  Yeah, I guess we have to. 
[03:00:00]  We have a quick decision to make, don't we?  Hey, Mara.  Do we?  Mara, whatever.  Mara.  Can we do nine?  Sorry?  Can we do nine?  The rules say eight.  Plus one?  Well, it's...  Plus one.  It's like a guest list.  Plus one?  We'll call it a plus one?  Well, she's got a personality on her.  Can I hug me again?  It wasn't me.  I'm not the hugger.  I'm not the hugger.  You're not the hugger.  Okay.  You want to see her naked before you make your decision?  I hate those huggers.  Who's it going to be?  Well, we got these eight, but this girl we think should maybe be in two. 
[03:00:30]  An alternate.  A plus one.  An alternate.  I like it.  And I think to see how they react in a party atmosphere.  Right.  I think maybe a party at my house.  Oh, perfect.  What do you think?  Danny?  Absolutely.  We want to see how you respond to Rohypnol.  We got to build up your tolerance to that with our creep listeners.  Yeah.  By the way, don't take a free beer from any of our listeners if it's opened.  Maura, we still have to, it's kind of like the Olympics.  We still got to do the testing to make sure none of these broads are pregnant or anything. 
[03:01:00]  Pregnant?  What would you like me to do with that?  How is that?  Yes.  We could either use the stick method from the pharmacy or Jimmy's face.  I just look and if an eye is staring back at me, it's a yes.  Boo.  I'm the number already.  Yeah.  You're ready here.  So we're going to do like an alternate at the very least.  We could kind of do that?  Yeah, we can kind of do that.  All right.  We'll figure something out.  If one is hungover or something.  I'm sure there's a problem with one of them. 
[03:01:30]  One's taking a dump.  Oh, God.  All right.  We had a lot of fun today.  You guys have a good weekend.  Blah, blah, blah.  Thank you, girls.  Thanks, ladies.  Very good job.  You were wonderful.  This was way better than we thought it would be.  You're all winners.  You're all winners.  Anthony's book.  Oh, look at them running.  Now that the mics are being turned off, they're running out of here.  All right, guys.  We'll see you Monday.  Thank you.  We're ready to get a photo. 
[03:02:00]  Great.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, my God.  Finally making it over to XM Satellite Radio or Sirius XM Radio or whatever it's called  right now.  It's called Sirius XM.  Sirius XM, sure.  And we got Vinnie Brand.  He made the walk from the other radio station.  Of course, the owner of the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  And now we're all arguing over the picks we made for the K-Rock girls.  Yeah, we're sort of breaking it down now, saying which ones we thought were really good, 
[03:02:30]  which ones shouldn't have made it.  Because obviously there are ones that we think unanimously should have been in.  But there are these other ones that we each individually think shouldn't have been in  or should have been in.  And that's what we've been debating during the walkover.  The first one was a definite yes for all of us.  Definitely.  The first one who came in.  Yeah.  We have a mic on out there.  What is Kenny doing? 
[03:03:00]  Kenny.  Kenny, what's the problem out there?  I was saying hello.  Somebody said hello to me.  Oh, we have a mic on.  Oh, yeah.  Hard to talk about.  Well, we try to get the reaction of the fans that show up, especially on a Friday.  Okay.  Yeah, it's fine.  It's all good.  When they're babbling into the mic while you're trying to fucking compose an idea in your head,  it's a little much.  Yeah, then we turn it off.  We try to, like, ride the mic.  The first one we all said yes to.  Yes. 
[03:03:30]  But she was hot.  Yeah.  The Staten Island mom I disagreed with you guys on.  I liked her.  No.  Dude.  No.  Here it is.  A lot of hard miles on that girl.  Here it is.  Truth of the matter.  There's a lot of miles with that one.  Truth of the matter is, it's no fucking, uh, there's nothing here that should hurt anybody  or anything.  But the fact of the matter is, when you had a couple of kids, that fucking belly there  was like a doily.  Yeah.  Kind of hanging a little bit.  It had lasagna going.  And who's going to be watching the kids when she's rocking?  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  And she's K-rock girl-ing.  Yeah.  I did not like the, uh, Israeli girl.  Too much.  A lot of crazy.  I loved her.  There was something crazy about her that was kind of cool.  Uh, the big head of, uh, black hair was kind of cool.  She looked like Charo with really dark hair.  Yeah.  The big back full of black hair was kind of weird.  Eventually she'll.  She had a lot of hair on her back.  She'd get deported.  The other girl can fill in for her.  Yeah.  Because she's a supporter of some bizarre Mid-East terrorist.  Sure. 
[03:04:30]  I didn't, I think she, and she had the hair on the back.  I told you that.  A little hair on the back.  I didn't notice that, but her ass I thought was kind of nice.  I thought the, uh, the Japanese girl was cute.  I thought the bean suit was just so horrific.  Yeah.  I couldn't tell.  It took away from her look, man.  Both of the Asian girls that were in there were wearing horrid.  Yeah.  Where was the other Asian girl?  Was there an Asian or whatever?  I thought there was another one.  The last one with the giant tits.  Right, right.  Letty, by the way, would marry her.  Because he likes, he likes girls with kind of a small ass and giant tits.  Wasn't there kind of an Asian thing going on?  Oh, the purple hair girl?  No, no, no.  No.  Who was sexy? 
[03:05:00]  There was only one Asian girl?  There was only one Asian.  I was singing two.  Wow.  What the hell happened?  Who was that last girl with the giant tits with the, uh, she was one of the last ones in?  The last three in.  I don't remember.  There was, there was no one.  Oh, she made it in, didn't she?  The last girl?  Yeah, but what nationality was.  She wasn't Asian, but she was, uh.  No.  There were no Asian?  Peru.  Peru?  No?  She was from, uh.  Boy, do we suck.  I don't know.  Can't figure out what the fuck girls we just looked at.  I know.  I gotta keep talking because it's all leaving our, our heads.  I don't fucking know.  Our memories stink. 
[03:05:30]  What happened?  I can't remember.  The fat girl was obscuring her.  The girl with the fucking, uh.  The fat girl was cute, though.  I like the fat girl because she took a beating and she stood there and took  it.  I like that.  Greg, that's right.  Why don't we just hire fucking eight Clydesdales?  Yeah.  The K-Rock horses.  You can beat them and they don't get come back.  Yeah, but they're cute in the face.  She always cares.  She wasn't cute.  I thought she was cute.  She was better than Staten Island Mom.  Yeah.  Staten Island Mom.  Yes.  Staten Island Mom was not.  I would have taken Chubby over to Staten Island Mom in a second.  Staten Island Mom would fuck your brains out, man. 
[03:06:00]  And the girl in the green bathing suit who said no to her.  I was disappointed.  Oh, I liked her.  I liked her, too.  No, which one?  The one we said no to.  What did you say no to?  Yeah, she made it in, didn't she?  Nope.  Her thighs were too big, I think.  I would have traded her for the other one in the green bathing suit.  I liked that one better.  Golden Bikini was good.  Oh, yeah.  She ruled.  Petite little thing.  Fucking ruled.  Strawberry Bikini was good.  She was good, yeah.  Yeah.  The Irish Dancer.  Yeah, she was definitely. 
[03:06:30]  Irish Dancer.  She's just too many tats, though.  She's a mess.  And the other one, yeah, too many tats on her, you think?  Yeah.  I'm not big on that.  I'm sorry.  You know something?  So many bitches are going to be in utter deep regret in years to come.  But we're not picking them for 30 years from now.  We're picking them for now.  Exact ticcatacly.  Bikini's looking for the future.  What about when she goes to college?  As a father.  Shut up.  I was very upset. 
[03:07:00]  I really thought you were going to have my daughter in there.  That was very.  I was too winning.  She didn't come out.  Was that believable?  Yeah, it was believable.  He was buying it.  He was totally buying it.  Yeah, because she told, she asked me, I said, well, when are you going up there?  And I'm like, nah, it doesn't matter.  I don't want you to come.  Oh, so you thought that was the setup.  I thought that was the setup.  Where did she get the personality from?  You or your wife?  Well, she's from my first wife.  So, God, I hope it's from me.  Oh, okay.  That's all right.  Gotcha.  My first wife had that personality of a cunt.  Supermodel? 
[03:07:30]  Wow.  She's a nasty human being.  Most of us wives do.  Does she have a relationship with your daughter still?  No.  Really?  No, she doesn't really do anything at all with my kids.  Why?  Because she's a cunt.  She's not involved at all with her kids.  Like, the two older.  At all?  At all.  She's still living in the area or did she move away?  She is in Pennsylvania.  Isn't that rare for a mom to say goodbye to her kids?  I know it happened to Travis, but.  Yeah, it is very rare.  I think it's rare.  It is rare. 
[03:08:00]  But it's not.  I think it's more fathers saying, you know what, I don't want anything to do with the  kids anymore, but you don't hear the mom thing as much.  Travis's mom took off with a Jew banker.  Yeah.  The problem was, Travis's mother, at least she left for money.  Yeah.  No.  Here's Travis.  She explained why she left.  She actually just left a big note on the kitchen table that said, girth.  Yeah.  She never had the walls hit.  She was all about the car.  And Travis's mom was the definitive just mom that would go to school events, do things, 
[03:08:30]  get their lunch, she worked at the school, and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere,  she just takes off and leaves with some guy.  I was going to say, she didn't exactly say goodbye.  She didn't say goodbye.  No.  Just left.  Yeah.  I don't think my ex-wife ever wanted to be, she was never a good doting, you know, let's  go do this shit.  No, no.  I had to do everything.  When we got divorced, I was 30 miles away.  The kid didn't need a pencil from school.  Call your father.  You have to drive 30 miles to drop off a fucking pencil. 
[03:09:00]  She's all horrible.  Jesus Christ.  What a cunt.  Yes.  When did you realize that you made a mistake marrying her?  Right after I said, whoops.  Oh, it was a whoops marriage.  Yeah, it was a whoops marriage.  And, uh, so why didn't you just have the kid?  Cause you know what?  I asked this, this friend of mine, I go, what should I do?  Cause I make an honest girl out of her, marry her.  And I did.  And I tried for a long time.  Two mistakes.  Great.  Yeah.  And you know what?  I hope she's happy now.  God knows she.  How long did you know her before the, the whoops? 
[03:09:30]  I met her when I was 18 and the first kid was at 22.  So three years later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More or less.  Well, we were breaking up.  That's the very hard part.  How long did you, I remember when you guys broke up, how many years ago did you break  up?  92.  Wow, man.  Yeah, 92.  So that's a long time.  Did it cost you a lot of cake?  You know what happened?  I didn't have a lot, so I just gave her everything I had, which wasn't a lot, but then it cost  me a lot, you know, to raise the kids.  I mean, she's no, no, zero.  She doesn't put a dime into her kids. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, but you love your daughter.  That's obvious, so.  Oh, yeah.  You got something nice out of it.  Yeah, I got three good kids out of it.  My son's a kick in the dick right now, but.  He really is.  How many kids you got?  I have five.  Holy shit.  Wow.  I would have one more, because I want one of them to turn out almost perfect.  Yeah.  You're a bastard.  You got to just keep spitting him out, hope you get, you know.  Get one good one out of the last.  My son was the easiest for the longest time, and now he's just, he's impossible. 
[03:10:30]  Really?  Yeah, he doesn't want to work, he doesn't want to go to school.  How old?  21.  Yeah.  Is he a midget like you?  No, he's tall.  Can't go, we have to, like, do the midget thing, you know.  Does he push you around?  Just once before you leave.  No, no.  No, he doesn't push you around.  Haven't reached that point?  No.  Where the son turns around and tells the father to go fuck himself and maybe throw some punches  at each other?  Uh, he would, I think he would know not to do that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He might reach a point, though, where he can kick your ass and...  Uh, he's gonna, I mean, he's gonna, he's younger than I am, I mean, at some point he's 
[03:11:00]  gonna be able to.  Hey, excuse me, but Travis is still looking for attention because his mommy left.  Oh, Travis's mother left.  That's not true.  I forgot about that.  How are Mother's Days?  I'm waiting it out.  How are Mother's Days around your house?  Around my house?  Yeah.  That's fine.  Me and my wife both don't have mothers, so.  So, oh, wow.  How old were you when your mother took off?  21.  Wow.  Oh, come on.  I mean...  21?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  You're a fucking adult.  That's not taking off.  That's moving on. 
[03:11:30]  Jesus Christ.  Taking off is, you know, the baby's laying there in a dirty diaper.  You're like, I'm out of here.  I can't take this.  Fucking 21.  You're crying.  She's lost all contact with the family.  She completely abandoned it.  She won't talk.  New family.  How old are you now, Travis?  27.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Vinny, when did...  So when your wife left, how old were the kids?  My youngest was six.  She left a six-year-old?  Well, yeah, but, you know, we...  Like, in other words, she kept telling me for years, I hate you. 
[03:12:00]  You're a fucking jerk off.  I want to divorce.  And so I was like, all right.  Why should I listen to this for another 30 years?  I've been hearing this for 12 years.  A song is old.  I just took off.  But it's funny.  She didn't want anything.  She didn't want me to work out.  She didn't want me to be in good shape.  She just, you know, don't go to the gym.  You're going to meet girls.  She had this whole thing.  I was going to try and meet girls.  I was 220 pounds.  I had a mullet.  I couldn't meet prostitutes.  But then the worst thing happens.  They split.  And he meets Vicky, who was a fucking 11.  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  Phenomenal blog.  She's still an 11.  And she did not have that belly thing happening at all.  My wife really did the whole get in shape.  How many kids?  Yeah, they got to do something.  Oh, you had two kids there?  Two kids.  Wow.  Eight and five.  And my wife's hot.  I mean, she's hot, Jimmy?  Smoking.  Yeah.  Look at Jimmy's face.  Believe me, if he didn't own a real lucrative nightclub, she wouldn't have spit on him.  She was really, really, yeah.  Look who's talking, Norton.  Look at you.  Dude, the whole reason I told joke one was because the dick was dry. 
[03:13:00]  Norton, do you remember in the club when you were an emcee and there was a night, I was  divorced and I was single and we both hooked up with girls.  On the couch or something?  Yeah.  I don't think I did well, though.  I don't remember.  Not only did you not do well, I was single, so I was really looking to have some release  because I had a horrible marriage.  And so I'm on this couch with this girl.  It's like 2.30 in the morning and Norton's on a couch and Norton's going nowhere.  All I hear the girl doing is giggling.  I don't know why. 
[03:13:30]  And Norton walks over and I'm kind of like involved and I feel a presence.  It's Norton.  And he looks at me, he goes, you want to go to the diner?  And I go, now?  And the girl goes, what?  And Norton looks at the girl and goes, get up, you stupid whore, we're going to the  diner.  Holy shit.  And that was the end of my night.  Oh, fuck.  And now I took it to the diner and I had to fucking buy food for four people.  Wow, you cock-blocked them good.  Oh, it was brutal.  I'm surprised I did that.  Why would I have blocked you?  I mean...  Because you were going nowhere and you were hungry.  Oh.  And you were, you know, you were still unseen. 
[03:14:00]  You were still doing high stuff.  What's your name?  What do you do?  Oh, I was awful.  So what's your name?  Hi, how are you?  My high voice.  What are you doing?  How are you?  How are you doing?  That must have been why she was giggling.  Jimmy was doing his ass back then, yeah.  But that's not the case now, Jim.  No.  No.  Travis just left in desperate, you know, depressed.  Yeah, he went to look for his mommy.  No.  First time she had her legs pinned properly behind her ears, she left the whole family in  mind.  How well do you have to fuck somebody to get them to abandon the idea of a family? 
[03:14:30]  Just leave their family.  Travis, when's the last time you talked to her?  Oh, nice.  Yeah, I mean, if you call her, will she take your call?  Six years ago.  Yeah.  And did you get your plugola for what we just did for K-Rod?  Oh, yeah, I think so.  I actually can't take this yet.  I think you should have Travis call his mother right on air and see how that goes.  I'm waiting for a sports car outside.  I got the GT, the Ford GT today for the car club.  So I'm going to be fucking getting tickets in that son of a bitch.  Guys, I'm a car girl.  Call me the Cruiser. 
[03:15:00]  The Cruiser.  Are you doing supercar weekend?  No, no supercar weekend.  When you drive two cars at the same time at speed, you're just asking for it.  That's what we found out.  Right.  So what?  No, just taking one for the weekend.  Nice.  That's it.  Nice.  That's why I can't take the wine.  Mm-hmm.  Start drinking that shit on my way home.  I'll take yours.  No, I'll take it.  Hey, we got...  Just later.  We got Keith in North Carolina.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, my brother's in the crowd up there. 
[03:15:30]  He's the bald guy with the beady little eyes.  Wait.  Where's the bald guy with the beady little eyes?  I see him.  We got a few bald guys.  Wait.  Let's have him come in studio.  Bring the mic in.  Hey, bring his girlfriend.  He's worried that we're going to take on his girlfriend because she's bald.  Hold on, hold on.  Don't say anything.  We do the radio, sir, because I kind of know what you want to do, and I want to make sure  we get this.  Yes, we need everything in place.  Right.  All right.  So we got headphones so we could hear his brother?  Your brother's on the phone there, sir. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, great.  All right.  He can't hear you yet, Keith, because why would we have headphones for the guy?  Yeah, we probably should have had something set up where if we wanted to bring a guest  in.  Yeah.  He's very nervous.  He looks like a young John List.  John List.  Wow.  John List reference.  But it works.  All right.  Now I'm going to ask again.  Uh-huh.  Can I have a pen when I come in?  I've asked almost every day, just repent.  No, you can't.  To be here.  Know what the running gag is?  To not give you a pen.  It's fucking...  It's so successful. 
[03:16:30]  Thank you.  It's mind-boggling.  We slammed it down in front of you, you mother...  Mother effer.  All right.  Can you...  Now you get 30 pens.  Can you hear now?  Yeah, I can hear.  All right.  Keith, you're on.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, and your brother's name is what?  Dan.  All right, Dan.  Okay, what do you got for Dan?  You ever call him Dan the man?  That's original.  Well, why don't you keep talking, because...  Hold on, Keith.  They're really worried that...  Keith.  Yeah, we didn't hear you, Keith.  Yeah, no, wait, wait.  No.  Keith.  Now go.  All right.  Go, Keith.  Go.  They're really worried that... 
[03:17:00]  Start over, Keith.  You've got to start over, because you talked during the time we were talking.  Can you hear us okay?  I don't think so.  Keith?  Keith?  No, you ass...  Did he bail out?  I think what he was saying...  You have a girlfriend?  Yes.  She's not here?  No, she's here.  But you were nervous that the girlfriend's going to want Jim Norton?  No, I don't think so.  What?  That's what your brother, I think, was getting at.  I don't know.  We can ask her.  Where's the bitch? 
[03:17:30]  I'm supposed to get a lot of paperwork.  Holy shit.  All right.  Jimmy just got very, very upset.  The same fucking issues every time.  Paul, get it.  Every goddamn day, right?  Terrified.  That girl was of Norton.  I'm sorry.  She's just...  Paul, the same old shit ain't going to work.  We got new...  One person.  Just one person at a time. 
[03:18:00]  We got new bosses listening now.  I understand that.  But you know when you guys...  This has to be done before we get here.  You got fucking four hours to do this.  What time did you come to work?  They weren't here.  They weren't here.  They came afterwards.  Everyone that did their paperwork, I took care of them.  Look at Jimmy.  The ones that came afterwards.  You got Jimmy upset.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  You have the same issues in everything.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Whether it's the...  It's little shit.  It's just little shit.  It's just fucking this...  It's like we want...  Where's the girl?  She's around the corner.  All right. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, we couldn't even see her.  She was around the corner out of eye shot and ear shot.  I didn't even know she was here.  And what...  How did you score that chick?  Yeah, something's not up.  I don't know.  Yeah?  Not on the up-up.  I'd like to change the mood and say that you could have come in very handy in the K-Rock  Girl competition.  Yeah, you would have came in.  As you have an ample breast.  Wow.  You like the big boobs on her, huh?  Are those au naturel?  Yes, they are.  Wow.  How old are you? 
[03:19:00]  24.  24.  Nice.  Sorry, I threw water when you came in.  How old's your dad?  I'm kidding, of course.  I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ.  I get that all the time.  I worry about it.  I do.  Oh, do you want...  I guess we have to ask you if you want Jimmy.  No.  Why would she want me?  Do you want Jimmy?  Do I want Jimmy?  Are you a fan of Jimmy?  No.  She's not definitely with the show, I don't think.  I've listened to the show.  I've listened.  Oh, that's always good.  That's good. 
[03:19:30]  You know.  So what was the brother trying to say?  Why did he hang up?  I don't know.  He just completely wrecked his...  Your brother's a douche.  He's wrecking the show.  What can I do?  You guys have never had a conversation where you thought you'd like to have Jimmy.  No.  This is ridiculous.  How long are you dating?  It's so ridiculous.  I guess you gotta just get naked now.  How long are you dating?  Since we were in high school.  Aw.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's...  And you're how old?  24.  Okay.  And you, sir?  25.  I'll be funny if he was 51.  So you guys have dated about, what, seven years? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  All right.  So you're probably a little bored with each other.  I mean, it happens.  Yeah.  Um.  Um.  Do you ever, like, show your breasts off?  No.  Hmm.  That's the problem.  All right.  Now we got a problem.  What's your biggest issue with relationships, sir?  I don't have any issues.  Oh, you might have one.  No.  Not a one.  No.  Nothing?  No.  It's 100% perfect?  It's perfect.  Okay.  I'm...  And I love my wife, and it's not perfect.  It's never perfect.  That's an idiot thing to say.  All right, Vinny, let me ask you. 
[03:20:30]  What's wrong with your wife?  Nothing.  Nothing perfect.  She's too perfect.  Her mere presence highlights his imperfections.  Oh, you two are...  Where are you from?  I forgot.  Raleigh.  North Carolina.  Raleigh.  North Carolina.  What time did you guys show up to the XM show?  Uh, we did the walkover with you guys, but you were late as hell.  So, you were basically outside for an hour, and that you could have easily been brought 
[03:21:00]  up, and the paperwork could have been done.  Well, I think they were in front of CBS.  Yeah, we were in the building.  Okay.  Yeah, they were in front of CBS.  Yes, Danny.  Well, I mean, to be fair, how many times have you guys said, like, do it during a break?  Like, the paperwork.  Well, yeah, yeah.  It should never be done, like, while we're on the air.  So, regardless of whether or not they were waiting at CBS, it's just like, why couldn't  we wait for a break or even after the show?  We need to cull from the audience whatever talent we can and whatever interesting things  happen, and that usually will happen during the first segment that we do, and I think 
[03:21:30]  then, when the break happens, then we can start handing out fucking, you know, clerical  stuff and that.  Good point.  Come on.  Sure.  Okay, there's one intern out there, and he would be the intern to assist me while I'm  taking care of you guys going to the bathroom, as I do every day.  But he complains, so he doesn't do the paperwork.  Who complained?  Well, hold on.  Who complained?  I don't know his name.  You can admit him right now.  He's a complainer.  We have a complainer on the crew. 
[03:22:00]  Here comes a complainer.  What was the complaint, James?  I had no complaint that I know of.  Oh, boy.  I was, one day, a couple weeks ago, Derek had something for me to do, and I was doing  the paperwork for Poe as I did all Fridays I was here.  The couple is in between this fight.  Look how they just kind of stand there going, ah, there's people yelling at each other.  Are you done with us yet?  Are you guys not going to do paperwork today?  No, because he complained.  So what?  So I'll do it myself.  Oh, hold on.  But somebody complaining, if that happened, doesn't affect what we're doing on air. 
[03:22:30]  I don't care if somebody's committing suicide outside.  That's nothing to do with us on air.  Absolutely.  I don't want to interrupt the show.  But what happened is the paperwork hasn't been done.  I know I did.  I'm good at that.  What did he complain about?  He complained about doing the paperwork.  When?  Oh, that was a couple of weeks ago.  So that's his punishment.  You did?  I had no complaint.  I said nothing.  Again, Derek had something for me to do.  Oh, stop your bitching.  I have no idea.  I had no problem doing the paperwork.  I've done it for weeks. 
[03:23:00]  I have no issue.  What did Derek have for you to do?  I think he had some production or FU calls for me to do or something.  Okay.  Oh, show stuff.  Show stuff, exactly.  Roll it.  But I've done the paperwork every week I was here on Fridays.  In fact, I'm copying IDs right now.  The whole idea is that I cannot be in two places at one time.  Why not?  Because I'm not that good.  But, Poe, let me ask this.  I mean, regardless of whether you can be in two places at one time, I'm getting the feeling  that that guy did not complain because he looks very innocent.  And I do sense from you a little bit of a throwing under the bus of this young man 
[03:23:30]  because you didn't do the paperwork.  And I don't even know what the fucking paperwork is.  I just think he's telling the truth.  That's okay.  You weren't here.  Steve, come on in.  Leave Steve knows.  Smoke shirt Vinny alone.  We are our next witness.  I meant that to be serious.  Oh, okay.  And it worked as a serious statement.  Yeah, that was very serious.  I didn't hear it.  My joke couldn't have bombed harder if I said, hey, that banana's yellow.  I didn't hear it.  I wish I did.  I just know you don't.  No, you really.  Wait, is this a surprise witness?  Surprise witness coming into the studio.  Sam? 
[03:24:00]  No, I was just...  Primetime Sam Roberts, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  What's the two places at once thing?  Because you have to...  Because Opie, in case Opie has to go to the bathroom, you have to open the door?  I have to go downstairs and get the guests.  I have to take care of Opie.  But what about signing the paperwork on the break?  Commercial break?  Absolutely.  See, that should be...  That's the whole thing.  I think the way this should work now...  And I don't know if this has come down from Washington or anything.  Washington?  What?  Well, whatever that place used to be.  Now it's New York. 
[03:24:30]  Coming down from down the street.  Yeah.  During the segment, when we first get here, every guest should be sitting there, and regardless  of if they filled out paperwork or not, we should be able to bring them in and use them  for the segment.  Then when the first break comes and we go, okay, we're taking a break, we'll be right  back, then the paperwork frenzy should start happening.  And that way it doesn't interfere like this girl was around the corner.  We didn't know. 
[03:25:00]  She's around the corner with her big boobs.  I understand what you're saying, Anthony.  I'm waiting to come in to be humiliated.  She wasn't humiliated?  I think she's doing a fine job standing in between an argument.  I think she's standing there thinking, why did I come from North Carolina for this?  For this shit.  What?  How do I get in the middle of an argument about paperwork and how is it radio?  I want to hear their conversation after the show.  Do you like that?  Yeah.  And Poe, by the way, you can be in two places at one time. 
[03:25:30]  You have to hop in a DeLorean.  You go back in time.  And while you're playing guitar on stage, you can knock out bad guys that are going to  fuck you up when you get done.  I like that.  So that's being in two places at once.  You just need the DeLorean flux capacitor.  A few other gadgets from Doc Brown.  Sam?  That's it.  No, that is true.  That's accurate.  Yes, of course it is.  It's documented.  May I?  Oh, yes, sir.  May I?  Okay.  While you guys are going on break, that door cannot open. 
[03:26:00]  I always get problems from the building manager.  When we go on break.  Right.  When you guys go on break, that door is not supposed to be open.  So I have to make sure that the door stays open while you guys go in and out.  Are we talking about a fucking door?  Your job is an automatic door closer.  What door can't be open?  The door.  The door.  That door.  Our front door.  Can't be open.  Cannot be opened all the time.  But during a break.  Even during break.  Which building manager can play in that fucking scumbag with the glasses? 
[03:26:30]  Yes.  Okay, he's a fucking cunt.  He's a fucking cunt.  Which one is he?  He looks like a fucking pedophile.  Fucking douchebag.  Jim, if she did want you, I think it is over.  He almost hit her with a water bottle.  Just another fucking, that wormy, ugly motherfucker.  I hope you're listening.  I hope you fucking die.  Wow.  All right, listen.  Now he's reading her mind.  It just cracked him in my mouth. 
[03:27:00]  All this shit that shouldn't affect on-air stuff that does drive me nuts.  I know.  I know they're listening.  It really does.  Serious Midtown.  I just want to let them know.  I want to let the new bosses know that we usually don't talk about doors on this radio show.  This is an exception.  Let's see if we can't get you guys three more hours and we'll do windows too.  Right.  Can we play Make a Hairy Pussy today? 
[03:27:30]  What the hell is that?  I think the Russian broad would be into this.  Are we done with this couple that is still standing here awkwardly?  Oh.  Oh, the couple.  Yeah.  Is your paperwork done?  Mine is.  Is yours done?  No.  Why the fuck not?  Sox, everybody knows the minute you walk up you got to do paperwork and apparently  no.  Post a busy opening and closing the bathroom door.  The building manager is afraid he might look in our door and see a cock balls that he's 
[03:28:00]  attracted to.  Fucking asshole.  Why don't you lay in the toilet with your mouth open?  Why is he worried about our door?  He's a spectacle, Mr. Whipple-looking bag of jism.  He's a fucking Mr. Whipple-looking jizz bag.  I'm trying to remember who this guy is.  He lurks out in front of the building just looking.  That's what you are.  You're a fucking looky-loo.  He's not the guys that are behind the desk, right?  No.  He's the guy that he waits outside.  He used to wait outside every day when we used to do the walkover just to make sure that  we weren't causing a ruckus right in front of the building.  It's like, what's his name?  Dennis the Menace, the neighbor. 
[03:28:30]  Mr. Wilson.  Mr. Wilson.  Yeah, exactly.  Whatever the douchebag was, that's who he was.  He probably loved little Dennis.  Wait, the other point.  Come here, Dennis.  Hold on.  The other point about the doors, we have get smart doors here, too.  Oh, I know.  There's plenty of them.  The one door, if you open that, you still got to get through another door.  So what's the big deal about the fucking first door?  The second door I keep open.  By the way, where are the building rules?  Can we see the building rules where it says the doors cannot be kept open?  Is there a rule for that?  Paragraph two, subsection five.  Well, fuck him.  No, no, starting Monday, we keep all doors open. 
[03:29:00]  We want to know.  All doors open.  If people are going to the bathroom, I would like to know maybe it's in the-  To the bathroom, to the turlet.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I'm sorry.  When you've-  The most mature show I've ever seen.  When you sign a lease, right, there's certain rules and regulations.  Obviously, the guy who's in charge of the building, they can say, you get no pussy at all,  you can't work there.  So, is there something I want to know about the doors being open? 
[03:29:30]  Because to me, he's just being a fucking scumbag.  Yeah.  And we don't violate the rules here.  We don't call the problem.  Dude, I just got you.  Dude, it's obvious.  I'm sorry.  It's obvious because what other fucking office in this whole building has eight cameras focused  on the fucking door that goes to his office so we can jack off to the fucking people that  come in and out of here?  Every day.  There's probably not that many other residents.  Yes, Danny?  Do you know that there's actually a pinhole camera?  Yeah!  In the molding by the elevators that's just focused on our door? 
[03:30:00]  On our door, there's a fucking fake smoke detector.  They want us out of here.  That's a camera.  Yeah.  And there's two of them that are focused right on the fucking door so they can just sit  there and watch his pretty girls come in so he can fucking jack off your fucking lurking  jacker.  He's a lurker and a jacker.  Oh, seriously.  I got yelled at about 15 minutes ago.  Well, go downstairs and ask him why we can't have our doors open.  We want an actual answer.  Okay.  Well, he mentioned something about keeping the air conditioning. 
[03:30:30]  Tell him, fuck the air conditioning.  We want to know where it says in the building rules that we can't keep that fucking bathroom  open.  That door open.  We go to the bathroom.  I want to know if he's going to The Economist and saying the same shit.  We're not causing problems.  Probably no one wants to kill the people on The Economist.  You're right.  They don't inspire rage at anybody.  Yeah, right?  But you know what I'm saying?  It's not like we keep the door open all the time.  We got big kids bobbling around.  To go to the bathroom on a quick break is not unreasonable because we have fucking doors 
[03:31:00]  that you need to lock and unlock with a car.  And E-Rock just made a good point in my ear here.  He said, what about the fucking bathroom that smells like a cadaver's bottle?  Always.  Oh, my God.  It's a fucking monkey cage.  How about you take care of the stupid bathroom?  That's a fucking monkey cage bathroom.  That's a dead mouse.  Take care of that.  Yeah.  Dead mouse smell.  Permanent dead mouse.  That's a fucking hooker.  It is nasty.  Can we have a copy of the building regulations?  Yeah, go get it.  I think that's very reasonable to ask for.  Well, now, I hate to...  This isn't really changing the subject, but I see Steve here and I see Poe here, and I 
[03:31:30]  want to address one more thing.  We could go back to this, but I want to address something that happened this morning.  Closy and homosexual up.  Yes.  All right.  Steve.  I want to address something that happened this morning.  Steve, if you could please enter the studio.  This morning, as I said earlier, I'm picking up a sports car.  Vroom, vroom.  Vroom, vroom.  So, Keith suggested to me that I take my SRX instead of the Escalade in to work.  So, I get in the SRX and realize it's out of gas.  So, I have to stop at the gas station.  Also, there's no easy pass in there. 
[03:32:00]  So, I'm like, shit.  So, I had to go through the cash lane at the tunnel.  So, I call up Poe, and I say, Poe, I'm going to be late.  Because he's sitting out there, and I let him know if I'm going to be a little late.  Uh, so, he then informed me, as I walked in, that Steve had informed Master Poe to ask me why I'm late when I call and say I'm going to be late.  And I got to tell you, I will not fucking tell anybody why I'm going to be fucking late. 
[03:32:30]  Okay.  Nobody.  There's no fucking one that deserves.  Who's my boss?  Who's my fucking boss?  If Mel Carmisen fucking calls me and asks why I was late, and technically, the show starts at six, I should be on fucking Jimmy Hours.  That's right.  We all want to be on Jimmy Hours.  I'm teasing, of course.  But, uh, the thing is, why would you ask Poe to ask me why I was going to be late?  I just asked why he, I, what I did was I asked, did he mention why he was going to be late? 
[03:33:00]  That's all.  No, Poe told me that he said, you said to ask, anytime I'm late, to ask me why I'm late.  Did I?  Yeah.  All right.  A couple of times.  And of course-  None of your fucking business!  All right, it's none of my fucking business.  Christ!  What do you mean a couple of times?  Uh, a few times, but I never ask him.  Usually what I say is-  Holy crap.  When he gets here, who-  I'm going to lose here now.  It's crazy.  Can we play, uh, Harry Pussy or what? 
[03:33:30]  Wait.  Oh, yeah.  Harry Pussy.  Let's play Harry Pussy.  So, let's play-  Actually, you know what?  Yes?  The truth is, sometimes, uh, I'll say to Ope, Ope, Ant's going to be late, and Ope will  ask why, and I'll say, I don't know.  So I ask Poe, and then Poe asks you.  Well, no, I never, ever ask you why you're late.  No, no, no.  Sorry about that.  Uh-uh.  No, Poe is-  Whenever you arrive, you arrive.  Poe has never asked me why.  Oh, really?  He forgets by the time you get there.  No.  All right.  Come on.  I don't ask him his ETA.  I don't care what car he's driving in, as long as it comes in. 
[03:34:00]  Can we bring the team back together and play Harry Pussy?  Can I point out why Steve has good improv skills?  I love you.  Yes.  This is what you should have said.  Um, oh, Steve.  What?  You just let yourself get yelled at.  Let's do this again.  Okay.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to show you what you should have done.  You're going to be Steve?  All right.  Yes, let me be Steve.  Hey.  Playing the part of Steve is Jim Norton.  This is what happened.  Um, say, now say, yeah, say to me, why, why did you ask why I'm going to be late?  Why would you ask why I'm going to be late?  I, I know I'm gay. 
[03:34:30]  Wait a minute.  How does that?  No, but I mean.  Because it's no one's business what, why, why I'm going to be late.  This is what Steve should have said.  Um, let's begin.  All right.  It's, uh, is it anyone's business why I'm going to fucking be late?  Well, I'm only checking because if you're stuck in traffic, you may be 40 minutes late  or I wanted to know if you're going to be five minutes late so I know what to tell  Opie and Jim to prepare something possibly for the beginning of the show.  All right.  That's pretty good.  But I did tell Poe how, but I did tell Poe how late I was going to be. 
[03:35:00]  I said I should be about 15 minutes.  Okay.  I was only asking because if it was traffic, it might've been longer.  So I just wanted to be there.  That was all.  It wasn't to question you.  It was just to see that if it was an issue beyond your control with traffic.  When I give the time of how late it's going to be, if I go, oh, it's going to be 10 minutes.  Oh, it's going to be 15 minutes.  That's good enough.  It shouldn't be whether it's traffic or not.  Well, who the fuck are you, Mr. Traffic?  Because you say 15 minutes, you've also said, yes, I'll only have one. 
[03:35:30]  There's a lot of things you say.  Can we...  That don't necessarily come to fruition.  What the fuck can't I think of that?  God damn it.  Because you're gay.  No, it has nothing to do with it.  I ruin things.  You do?  No, I don't.  I didn't say that.  That was an odd thing.  Let's thank Poe.  Let's thank Steve.  Let's thank the couple that has been standing there awkwardly for the last 20 minutes.  And it's time to play Big Hairy Pussy.  No, it's called Let's Make a Big Hairy Pussy.  I just thought I was Big Hairy Pussy. 
[03:36:00]  Hey, Russian broad.  How naked have we gotten you in the past?  What?  The Russian broad.  You've gotten me to show my ass?  Okay, good.  I am?  All right, get in here.  This is...  I want to...  This is something I...  Now, we might be able to...  Wow.  Wowee.  Voluptuous today.  Did you ever bang Pat Duffy, by the way?  Yes.  You guys had sex?  Yes.  Pat Duffy.  What?  I was just reaching for straws.  So is she, looking at the size of his dick. 
[03:36:30]  How is sex with Pat Duffy?  Tripped up on a little...  A plus.  Really?  Yes.  So, are you guys, like, dating or anything?  Would you like to answer that, Mr. Duffy?  Uh, we fuck sometimes.  Yeah.  And then what happens?  No, we're...  I don't know.  We're not really...  We're not boyfriend and girlfriend, but...  You're like brother and sister.  Yeah.  Wait, what's wrong with her that you don't want to date her?  Oh.  What?  I'm sorry, Sam was distracting me.  What's wrong with her that...  That you don't want to date her?  Good question.  There's nothing wrong with her.  I just...  I don't... 
[03:37:00]  I'm not looking for a girlfriend at the moment.  Is she nice?  Girlfriends cost too much money.  There's too much commitment.  I cost a lot of money.  Is she good?  Yeah.  Why is she good?  She put her tongue in my butthole.  Wow.  She's good.  She hits herself.  Jesus.  Very nice.  Literally, I didn't know I was into it until it happened, and it was the greatest...  Do you have videos on your phone?  Yeah, I do.  You want to see one?  Oh.  Yeah, he's got one.  Holy fuck.  Well, what the hell is this about? 
[03:37:30]  I didn't know we were going to get into this.  I was going for something else, but all right.  What do we got there?  What's the video on?  What, do you use a rear view mirror?  No.  How'd you get that?  It's kind of hard to know.  Oh.  I don't want to see it.  This is the first screening.  That's how big your dick gets?  I told you I was a grown-up shower.  It's Jimmy.  What?  Thanks, Ope.  Not look at her tits bare.  Wow, your cock's hard.  No, all you have to check it out. 
[03:38:00]  Hold on.  Let me see the big mouthful.  That's Duffy's view of himself getting blown.  That's the little thing we saw today gets like that?  All of the interns have seen this.  And all of them mentioned his dick instead of me.  Oh.  Right there, she calls me a filthy lumberjack.  A filthy lumberjack?  Oh, my God.  Just look at him.  Joe Anthony.  Come on, I've got to see Pat's delicious hog.  I would really rather not.  She has great technique, and he fucking Pat has pretty good camera work, considering  he's getting quite a hummer. 
[03:38:30]  All right, let's see.  I can't believe DoorTalk holds up this.  Wow.  She does have a technique.  Quite the technique.  That was just the beginning.  Duffy's packing, though.  Duffy's using camera trickery.  Of course he is.  It's the overhead view, and he's got it framed right before his pube mound.  Just like this?  I'm literally doing it like this.  No, he makes it look like there's just so much cock you can't get it all on film.  Right.  She has a little dollhouse furniture next to it. 
[03:39:00]  Show Vinny.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  Thank you.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Yeah.  Well, she does have very good technique, and she's seen very...  All right, I've seen enough.  That's amazing, by the way.  I can't believe that that is the same cock.  The same little thing we saw earlier.  Pat did tell me that he likes to show that video off because he knows that it's looking a little better  than it's supposed to.  Nowhere in that video do you see his face.  Oh, it's me.  Yeah, that's true.  It's trickery.  What's the tongue in the butthole thing all about? 
[03:39:30]  It's awesome.  I don't know.  She suggested it firsthand.  I never did it before.  I was like, have at it, Hoss.  It was great.  Have at it, Hoss.  It's romantic.  She was filmed sucking nothing in front of a green screen.  You were added in later.  Right.  So can we play Make a Hairy Pussy with you?  What is that?  Make a Hairy Pussy.  We're going to use Sam's hair, of course.  Ooh.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  And somehow we've got to get Sam...  Like, you've got to kind of put Sam's head in a leg lock in such a way that it looks 
[03:40:00]  like a hairy pussy.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I think you'd need someone's permission for that.  Namely, Sam.  All right, let's see if Sam...  And then mine.  Oh, I could pretty much answer that for you.  You said you're not going out with her.  I hate Sam more than anything in the world.  Oh, that's right.  You were stabbed before by K-Rock Girls.  That's fine.  Are you kidding me?  You're going to fuck up our bit.  Sam, would you use your hair as the hairy pussy?  Hey, I'll do anything for this show.  Because now he knows it ain't going to happen.  So he's the one that looks like the good guy.  I don't want to ruin a bit.  Can you put aside your differences for Let's Make a Hairy Pussy? 
[03:40:30]  It's the first time we're trying this bit.  If I punch him, I have no control over my actions.  Wow, and we know he is violent.  I think you guys got over your problem.  We can't have any physical violence threat and can't have it happen.  Yeah.  All right.  Or else nothing will happen.  Can't happen.  All Sam has to do is kind of just bend down and then she's going to just kind of...  So it looks like a hairy pussy.  All right, that's fine.  Don't worry, I'll console you afterwards.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure you will.  Oh.  Sexy bitch.  You're going to get fucking slapped later really hard. 
[03:41:00]  Holy shit.  How are you?  All right.  Oh, is that...  We really beat the shit out of each other.  Oh, yeah.  I got bruises like all up and down my thighs.  You guys are like a healthy couple.  I can't believe you're not more involved.  Mickey and Mallory.  What does he do?  He slap you as he's having sex with you?  Yeah.  Where?  All over?  Yeah, everywhere.  The face?  Mostly the face.  Mostly the face.  Do you like it?  Oh, yeah.  You like it and slapped in the face while he fucks you?  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  I like it even when he's not fucking me.  Really?  All right, give her a slap.  Let's give her a little slap.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, shit, did he nail her?  Nice.  God damn, is that good.  She's a trooper.  Am I crazy?  I filled up.  Missed that.  So did I.  All right.  So why aren't you guys, like, serious?  It seems like this is a good match.  I don't know.  We'll see how things go.  Boxing match.  I missed that one.  We'll smack it one more time.  All right.  Hold on.  This is her pal talk.  Hold on.  Wait, can we get her permission?  You're all right with this, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  This one's a little numb, so...  All right.  You want the other side, left-handed?  Don't hurt her.  Good. 
[03:42:00]  Get out of the...  Fucking idiot.  Who's in the way?  Who got in the way?  Oh, I'm sorry, Steve.  You're not a fucking idiot.  The guy on the camera that I just saw the back of the head of is a fucking idiot.  That would be Steve.  Shit.  Every camera I go to, that is a perfect view.  Of course he's here.  A woman's being injured.  Wow.  And you slap him back?  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Give him one.  All right.  Can we get the head out of the back?  Oh!  I'm going to get the fire.  Fucking camera. 
[03:42:30]  Higher.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  You fucking bitch.  You're going to die.  How about that one right there?  That's good.  I'm not using that one.  What is that about?  Well, I don't know.  That's his dirty talk.  Do you like that?  Yeah.  You're done later.  What does that mean for later?  She can take a punch really well.  Can't she?  Where do you punch her?  Where do you punch her?  No, it's just like, there's just a lot of hitting and biting.  Oh, there's a lot of biting.  Yeah.  All right.  Who's going to bite who now? 
[03:43:00]  Whatever.  I don't care.  It's up to you two.  It especially hurts when he's biting, like, the thigh.  Let her do it to him.  That hurts very much.  All right.  Why don't you bite Pat?  Pat, don't go psycho on us.  No, I'm like right there.  I'm at the tipping point.  You might go psycho on her.  He's getting a boner right now.  Why would I have it?  Because she smacked you?  Yeah.  So it just gets me going.  You do know you're going to end up in a car trunk somewhere, right?  And this is...  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It's got to be her hitting him or whatever.  No, our dirty talk is like him talking about killing me.  Yeah.  That's always a big turn on for me, too. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look.  I got the shovel and the lie.  Oh, I'm left.  What the hell?  Have this always turned you on getting beat up?  Oh, fuck yeah.  She's great.  Are you one of those girls that likes to get their boobs punched?  We've never done that before.  You just planted a brand new game.  Yeah.  We've heard it all on this show.  Yeah, you guys are like silent.  It's like for once the show's phased.  It's because we're slapping each other.  It's a little weird.  Just smacking each other around a little.  That's how me and Ariel met. 
[03:44:00]  My ex-girlfriend on your show.  I slapped her in the face.  Oh, that's right.  Remember on the park, Farron?  Yes.  And love blossomed.  Yeah.  You want Pat to bite her now?  No, she bites Pat.  Yeah, but he might do something stupid.  No, it's better if she bites him.  No way.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  Where do you usually bite him?  Pretty much everywhere.  It doesn't matter.  I don't care.  Ball sack?  It's fine.  Bite his ass and leave teeth marks.  Sure.  All right.  Is he cool with that?  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  Pat, by the way, if she's biting you and you fart, you get upset.  I'll do it sideways.  I'd like to.  Bonus.  Sideways.  We have to see it, though, sweetheart.  We can.  I don't.  I, I, I, I.  I'll take the worst way.  Worst camera angles ever.  Look at the guy.  The guy taking pictures.  The big dopey guy with his fucking camera.  I gotta get a picture of his balls.  Look at.  Oh.  I'm trying to avoid looking at you.  You're taking a picture for later.  All right.  All right. 
[03:45:00]  All right.  Let's pull.  Look away.  Oh, God.  Ow.  Ow.  Wait, Pat, you're uncutched.  Did that leave teeth marks?  No, I'm not.  See?  There we go.  It's just really, stop it.  You're making me feel sheepish.  Watch the language, Pat.  I left the purple mark.  Did she really bite you that bad?  I don't know.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  What the hell's wrong with these two?  Eat McGillicuddy.  All right.  Now what do you do to her in return there, Pat?  I'll bite your vagina.  Sure.  All right.  No, no, no. 
[03:45:30]  You can't.  Why?  You can't have someone's pussy bitten.  Because if something hurts her, you're fucking doomed.  No.  I love something.  You can't bite her cunt.  All right.  Sorry.  How can he be the voice of reason?  That's amazing to me.  If Norton's saying no, you're like, why?  Why can't that happen?  I'll bite her ass, too.  That's so funny.  I think if we leave the clit out of it, we'll be fine.  Bite her clit off and spit it out like a jelly bean.  I already tried to bite it off once.  She made me stop.  Really?  Yeah, I was biting way too hard.  If women don't bite, you bite a little bit, man. 
[03:46:00]  You don't bite too hard.  No, they're violent with each other, these two.  They're very violent with each other.  I almost killed her with a knife one time.  I got really carried away, and I was pressing a knife into her neck.  It was just crazy.  Jesus Christ.  Shit.  Yeah, you're gonna, you're gonna go.  He's only five knives at his place, at least.  The words Robert Chambers mean anything to you.  Yeah, right?  It's gonna just, one day, you're gonna go right through, and you're gonna be trying to  explain that to 12 people in a jury.  I was just having sex, and I jabbed the knife into her heart.  I didn't mean nothing by it.  No, I know.  Amish killer.  No, it really does get to a point where I have to, like, stop for a second. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  And be like, I'm gonna either continue fucking you or kill you.  Do you have other anger issues toward women in general?  A whole lot.  Wow.  Yeah, just really towards a lot of things.  He's a very angry young man.  This tape is gonna be so good after he kills you.  For real.  Like, we're gonna, we're gonna then be able to play it and go, wow, we got this story.  It's gonna be in all the newspapers and everything, and we'll be like, wow, you know.  This is the last thing he said.  So what do you want to do to her that we can do on the radio?  What can I do, Steve?  Can I bite her breasts?  Choke her out?  Can I bite her stomach?  I'm kidding. 
[03:47:00]  Totally kidding.  No bodily harm?  I don't think you should be biting her.  Okay.  Why is it okay for her to bite him?  How about a little...  Because she's not gonna get carried away and get him really hurt.  How about a little spanking on the ass?  That's fine.  Just a little bit.  It's hack for you, guys, I'm sure.  Maybe with a Freddy Krueger glove on it.  I like close fists.  Could you spank her without razors in your fucking face?  I'll try.  I'll try.  Check out your fucking knives.  All right.  All right, hold on.  Can we see her bare bottom?  I got it, Ron.  I got it.  Go ahead. 
[03:47:30]  Let's see the bare bottom.  Bare bottom.  Yeah, you gotta have to move to the side a little bit.  Turn the...  Hold on, turn that way so we can see...  No, we're not just...  Holy mackerel.  No, move the other...  There we go.  Look at those panties!  Five, I guess.  They're lovely.  God damn it.  Oh, sh...  Oh, come on, pussy.  What?  Wow.  All right.  He really nails her.  Yeah.  Do you like being spanked like that?  Everyone's in shock.  Oh, she likes it.  That's gonna leave...  She looks just a little bit like she's in pain.  Just a little bit.  Let's see the marks.  Here, turn this way. 
[03:48:00]  I bet there's big hand marks.  Yeah, they're pretty red.  Oh, shit.  All right, that one had to hurt.  That one hurt?  Well, the third time, yeah.  Yeah.  You liked it, though.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Did you like it?  I did.  Wow.  If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.  Are you guys hanging out or not?  Just there once in a while?  She's coming over today.  Oh, yeah.  She's making me dinner.  That's great.  Fucking cyanide.  Put some cyanide in there.  Yeah, of course.  It's all good.  Yeah.  He's into that.  We're doing everybody a favor. 
[03:48:30]  They are fucking strange.  This is not gonna end well.  They're a strange, strange pair.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good.  Made for each other.  It's been based on violence.  I met her by calling her fat.  You guys are consenting adults.  Are you...  Fuck it.  Are you ever scared of him?  No, never.  I warned her the first time she came over that there's a possibility she'll be killed.  Oh, yeah.  He's like a long text afterwards.  He's like, seriously, I'm at my highest point when we're having sex, so I might just pull 
[03:49:00]  a knife out on you.  So I'm like, okay.  Yeah, because they're both one and the same, violence and sex.  Yeah.  So it's really hard.  But they're really not, though.  For me.  But why, though?  But not even for you.  You're mixing them up, man.  Because it's like you're at that height of passion, I guess, and I just get angry.  How come you don't know how to handle all that emotion?  I don't know.  That's what that is, man.  Especially with a girl you like.  The violence and sex is not the same, because I like his slap.  Who says he likes me?  I like to pull hair.  That doesn't make sense, though.  I like to do nasty shit.  I understand the fucking part about you wanting to hurt somebody a little bit. 
[03:49:30]  I kind of get that, too.  He fucks like De Niro in Cape Fear with that woman that he met at the bar.  Dude, I just saw that the other day.  Well, this is from the 90s.  Just the other day, her awful jokes.  I'm drinking Seabreeze if you can afford it.  How funny is that?  All he's thinking about is I'm going to chew this bitch's cheek out and fucking rape her.  Fuck her silly and leave her with two black eyes.  PC from Virginia.  We missed the line.  I bet the dinner's going to be cold again.  Better not be. 
[03:50:00]  As she cooks her bad dumpy some dinner tonight.  That's a little lippy.  Better watch yourself.  You two are quite a pair.  You didn't like it when he bit your pussy that hard, did you?  Oh, I loved it.  Come on.  How hard did you like it when you almost bit your clit off?  No woman likes that.  When I tell him to stop, that's when I tell him to stop.  But everything up to that is amazing.  Can he pinch it?  He can do anything he wants.  Does he stop right away?  Does he sometimes push it just a little further?  No, he stops.  I think your life is going to end behind bars.  How about a bite through the panties or a pinch? 
[03:50:30]  I say a pinch.  Better taint like an apple.  I say a pinch with the fingers is a lot safer than a fucking bite.  Well, of course.  All right, let's do a pinch.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Can we see the panties with the underpants on?  No, no, no.  I need you to turn this way.  Not so I can see, because I don't care at all.  Of course I care.  All right.  All right.  He's a little bit of a pinch.  I want to rip that off.  Sorry.  See, that's not the right reaction to a vagina.  Yeah. 
[03:51:00]  I handle pain very well.  It's fine.  But wanting to squeeze it and smack it is healthy.  But I want to rip that off.  Is that right, Jim?  Meaning, I understand an animal lust where you're like, you grind your teeth and you don't  know what to do with all this energy you have, this fucking lust.  But it shouldn't come out wanting to rip the vagina off.  Because then what do you do with it?  You have the only part of her that counts.  Let's, uh, true.  Thanks, everybody.  Let's break out some cigarettes.  You guys do the cigarette burns or what?  You've got issues. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  All right.  It's them that doing it.  You're back there just really happy.  How about finger on the hiney?  Who's ever put a finger in each other's hiney?  Oh, they're both.  They're both.  Yeah.  Really?  How about this?  That's a good way to end this.  Like a Norman...  End?  I'm in fucking A.  How about this?  Like a Norman Rockwell.  If you're both facing that way and you each have a finger in the other's hiney.  Aw.  No.  That's cute.  I like that.  Cute picture.  I kind of like it.  She's not into it.  How about a thumb? 
[03:52:00]  Would you put a finger?  I've had a whole hand.  Would you put a finger in Pat's hiney?  Who's going to take a finger?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  A thumb?  She'll put a finger in Pat's hiney.  My thumb with his thumb ring.  No.  All right.  Here we go.  She's going to put a finger in Pat's hiney.  All right.  How about with your left hand?  So if you accidentally shook...  No, no.  I changed it.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  We have to see it.  Pat, turn this way to be good, please, sir.  I don't think we do have to see it.  We have to see it.  No way.  We already watched him getting blown and fucking pinching a pussy and having his ass bit. 
[03:52:30]  I've already had a prostate exam here.  Yeah, I know.  Pat's bending down.  And now she's sticking a thumb in there.  I have to shit.  Just so you know.  Ow!  That's not nearly as cool as this one alone.  Oh, my God.  Oh, brother.  I hope that's nail polish.  It's nail polish.  I thought she...  Oh, my God.  I thought she pulled out a plum.  Hold on.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, E-Rock.  Put the mic down.  Don't give any indications.  You're going to do a little test.  You're going to tell...  No, shoot.  Give Pat the mic to it.  You're going to...  No, Pat.  Ron, you're going to hold the thing for E-Rock.  You're going to smell both of her hands and see which one did she just use.  Yeah.  That's all.  Smell both and then tell us which one she just used.  He looks a little bit like Otto.  Okay?  I can't watch that.  Have fun with this.  No, no.  Separate them.  So he...  Separate them.  There you go.  Yeah.  Separate. 
[03:53:30]  See which one he just used.  No, no, no.  You're not going to...  That's my ass.  That's my ass.  He got on the first guest.  What's it smell like?  It's not as bad as I was expecting, but it's pretty sour.  Yeah.  It's pretty sour.  It's not clean at all.  It's not clean.  Today's going to be fun.  Oh, yeah.  But you won't take a licked Duffy finger, you know, just tell me. 
[03:54:00]  I didn't even mean that.  She's a trooper.  I meant Duffy licks his finger and shoves one up in your bunghole.  I think I'm going to puke.  No?  She's got to be worked into it.  I was a little nervous about the butthole.  Your girls are a little different.  You want to fist her?  Yeah.  Fist her.  A suit puncher in the asshole.  Oh, God.  Every time I come here, it's always asses.  It's the third time this happened.  We do have a fixation on the ass here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, because we never grew up. 
[03:54:30]  You guys are fucked up.  Yeah.  A lot of psychological issues.  A lot of unresolved daddy issues.  Yeah.  When did daddy leave?  Daddy never left.  So what's the problem with daddy?  He's gone tonight.  He's rushing.  He'll be out of there tonight.  If you smell her other thumb.  Wow.  How'd you know it was Valentine's Day?  He was attacking your clit with a nail gun.  Well, we're getting a suggestion for a chili dog. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, the chili dog.  The old chili dog.  Wow.  That's for your shit on a girl's chest and then tit fucker.  Tit fucker.  And your dick, you know, looks like him.  The chili dog's my favorite idea.  You're a beginner after all.  Quick, get your cameras ready.  All right.  This is a photo op.  All right, you two.  I don't know what else to do with that.  I'd be down, but I don't have a log on deck.  You said I had a shit when she was sitting on a finger.  I know.  Well, it felt like I did.  I don't like it. 
[03:55:30]  She just packed it right back up there.  She really did.  He made a disgusting groan.  Because it's not nearly as good here as it is when I'm alone.  Do you think the middle finger might inspire a duty urge more?  Probably.  I love a duty urge being fucking inspired.  Duty urge.  This is fucking sick.  You got anything else you'd want to do?  I think we've covered most of them.  Let's do everything.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:56:00]  Do you want to slap me again?  Sure.  All right.  Same side?  She swings hard, man.  Being slapped with her shit-famed fingers.  Get back at me with that.  You got to get a solid.  That was my jaw.  That's fucked up.  Oh!  What the hell?  Fuck, man.  Look how pissed he is.  He's not pissed.  He's getting really horny.  Ew.  No.  It's a combination of both.  More rage.  Pat, will you have a black eye for that?  That's a big hit. 
[03:56:30]  No.  You want to punch me?  No.  Who's that?  Oh, my God.  That's...  All right.  All right, then.  I think we're good.  Sorry.  I had to step in and say, no, he can't bite our cunt.  Voice of reason, aren't you?  Would you do a rusty trombone today for everybody?  That's a cute thing.  I'm not familiar with all these.  Oh, that's when you tongue his asshole and then give him the reach around 
[03:57:00]  and use his cock like a trombone slide  as you, like, tongue his asshole like the mouthpiece.  Mwah.  Oh, that's been done for her.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  That's been done.  It's the rusty trombone.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  That's been done.  It just hasn't had a name.  And it's rusty because, you know, it's rusty.  Well, yeah.  Rusty trombone.  I've never seen a rusty trombone.  That'd be good therapy, too, wouldn't it, Mac?  Rusty trombone.  Yeah.  Oh, God almighty.  That's amazing.  I have to explain this to my wife later. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  It's such a hard thing to do.  All right.  Well, there they go.  Are we going to see a rusty trombone?  I don't know.  Are we going to see a rusty trombone or what?  I don't think I'm grown right now.  I'm good.  We'll film it later.  She can just grab on and kind of, you know, and then as long as she's shoving her tongue  up your ass, we don't care what she does with the hand.  It could be a rusty harmonica.  We don't care.  I'd rather, before she puts her mouth back there, I'd rather clean my ass.  All of a sudden, she's getting religious.  You want her to just yank it really hard? 
[03:58:00]  You want to pull them around like do the elephant walk or something?  Elephant walk.  You want to pull my balls really hard?  Sure.  You guys do that?  You want to pull my balls really hard?  Wait, you do this too?  Yeah.  You like your balls pulled?  Yeah.  I like her to try to rip everything off.  Like, make it hurt.  All right.  This could be the...  This is like a line.  I mean, this is a direct quotation. 
[03:58:30]  I wish your pussy had teeth.  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, that's healthy.  I always feel like they do.  That's my problem.  Mother issues.  All right, here.  Just a little domineering.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, we can't see, baby.  We can't see.  Oh, it's okay.  Okay.  There you go.  Pull harder.  Come on.  Oh, fine.  Oh.  Damn it.  Ow.  What the hell?  That's gotta hurt.  Oh.  What's up with that?  You could do a little better than that.  Why do you...  I could, but you were...  You're kind of pulling away a bit.  I'm making it worse.  Oh, okay.  I could do it.  Just don't let go. 
[03:59:00]  Whatever you do.  All right.  Just pull.  All right.  Just gotta hold...  Ah!  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  That's not right.  What are you doing?  You really like your bag tug like that.  Yeah.  Why?  It looks fun.  It likes the pain.  Because he's fucked up.  Wow.  And you like that, right?  Love it.  You want to kick him in the balls now?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Have you guys ever done that before?  No.  All right.  Wait a minute.  We've had experience with this, Russian broad.  Don't go full swing.  I don't know your real name.  Gene? 
[03:59:30]  Gene?  You gotta know how to kick him in the balls.  Okay.  How do I kick him in the balls?  Your foot.  You gotta kick me like this.  You can't kick me like a field goal.  You gotta kick like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Use the top of your foot.  No.  You gotta like...  Not the...  Don't use the toe.  Use the top.  Oh, okay.  You have to.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Wait, hang on.  Hang on.  No, that was my thigh.  It's fine.  Take your shoe off.  Can someone...  I'll take your shoe off.  And can someone mic pass balls so we can hear it?  Hurry up, Ron.  All right. 
[04:00:00]  All right, tell me when.  I'd like to say I'm at the...  Oh!  Holy shit.  Do it again.  Do it again.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Everybody...  Oh, yeah.  He's down.  Oh, he's down.  He's down.  He's down.  He's down.  Did you like it?  Oh, that was awesome.  You really liked it, Pat?  Yeah.  We're going to do that later.  We didn't get good audio on that because Vinny was talking...  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah, Vinny, shut your fucking mouth.  Hold on.  Everybody.  Oh, shh. 
[04:00:30]  Okay, when you're ready.  Shh.  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  All right.  She fucking wailed him.  All right.  Listen.  Holy shit.  There's no effing way.  There's no effing way anyone could take a shot like that.  Holy shit.  There's no effing way anyone could take a shot like that.  He's sweating.  He's sweating.  Tom and Atrix is...  You all right?  Kick guys in the balls.  There are guys who will get kicked in the balls like that for an hour.  No fucking way. 
[04:01:00]  Holy shit.  That was fucked up.  Did you like doing that, Jane?  Of course.  Did you?  I did.  I could never...  It was so soft and just...  Cushy, right?  Pat, you all right?  Yeah, I'm great.  Great.  You get that lower abdomen pain and...  Why am I bouncing up and down?  Why?  Because it hurts.  What the fuck?  That was kind of a good audio.  Yeah, that was really...  I could never take that. 
[04:01:30]  I can't...  No way.  He isn't human, I swear.  Give me one more.  All right, hold on.  All right, hold on.  One more, you're crazy.  Wait, good audio.  Hold on, all phones.  We'll tell you one.  All right, guys.  Here she goes.  Go.  Go.  Holy crap.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  You're, like, feeling his pain.  Fuck.  Holy shit.  Dude, I'm dizzy. 
[04:02:00]  And I didn't even get hit.  Wow.  How the fuck can you take a shot like that?  They are fucked up.  Because I deserve it.  Oh, wow.  How can you...  I'm not even...  How can you take a shot like...  Are you guys amazed out there?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  This is no joke.  How the fuck can you take a shot like that?  I like it.  Hey, Pat, have you ever been to a dominatrix?  No.  Because they don't fuck you.  They just...  You would probably like one.  Seriously.  We should get Pat...  Yeah, he's got one. 
[04:02:30]  Holy shit.  But she could be there for it.  But we should get a professional dominatrix to show them things they can do.  Because you'd probably be surprised at the amount of fucking ways they could administer discomfort that you would enjoy.  Discomfort.  That surpasses discomfort.  Jimmy, I gotta ask.  Do you guys ever just hold hands or hug?  Not really.  Really hard.  Just squishing them.  Oh, man.  What do you feel?  Like, how can you...  Like, I couldn't like that.  Like, I can like my balls tugged a little bit.  It's like...  It's just... 
[04:03:00]  It's very warm in here now.  No, they gotta be juggled a little.  It's really good.  But can't that do...  Nothing any harder than Captain Queeg did the little metal balls when he was upset.  Right.  Wow.  Strawberries.  Welcome to the 50s again.  Yes.  We're the 60s.  Hey, Chuck, how many portions of ice cream did you have?  I knew there was a portion.  It was a key.  They called me old Yellowstain.  50-year-old movies.  I collapsed on the floor.  I looked uncircumcised.  That's fucking hilarious.  So we've covered Platoon, The Shining, and The Cain Mutiny. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  Can I put my shoe back on?  Oh, sure.  Yeah, I think you're all right.  Hey, can that do damage?  Do we even know?  I hope so.  Probably, but Dominate, she's doing it all the time.  Yes.  Like, that's such a common thing for Doms to do balls.  She's never done it before, though.  Well, she just kicked him.  She didn't have a shoe on.  There are Doms that will kick guys in the balls.  And I mean really fucking kicking in the balls.  There are guys that...  That was really kicking in the balls for an hour.  They'll stomp on their balls with high heels.  Yeah.  And, like, just stomp on their...  Not just the bag.  They're fucking balls with high heels. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah, I mean, there's damage.  How the fuck do you do that?  What, do you want to try that?  I don't know.  Yeah, here.  He'll be fine.  No, no, no.  He's on the floor.  He's on the floor.  Now I'm into it.  All right, get on that.  Do it in the privacy of your own fucking sick-ass bedroom.  I have a studio apartment.  You probably like CBT, as they call it.  What is that?  Cock and ball torture.  Dom's doing it.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, where they tie your dick up and they slap it.  Slower.  Yeah.  You ever have your dick slapped?  Yeah.  That can be kind of fun.  Yeah.  Fucking... 
[04:04:30]  It feels a lot better than you think.  Not too hard, but when they're just, like, slapping your dick like that, that can be nice.  But I can't take it away from that, yeah.  And does that take away time that your dick is in her mouth?  Because I've slapped my dick, suck it, hmm.  Choice.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.  A dom won't suck your dick.  Fuck that.  I ain't going to any dom.  Well, aren't you, Mr. Spinner?  Fuck that.  Why don't you just explain why you were late, then?  I will.  I'm gay.  I was tied up and... 
[04:05:00]  Well, fucking Steve was giving Anthony the business.  He was giving me the business.  Yes.  Well, make one call him back and ask him why.  I want to know why.  All right.  You can't actually severely hurt yourself by getting kicked in the balls, by the way.  How's that?  Oh, yeah?  Broken blood vessels, probably.  Yeah, there are major arteries in the groin, and a well-aimed kick could crush them, causing  internal bleeding and eventually death.  Yeah, if they bleed to death, that's what happens.  All right, got my weekend plans.  Yeah, but that's like fucking...  Do you feel like you're injured?  No, I feel great. 
[04:05:30]  That's what major artery.  Full of life.  All right, if you guys can do that at home, why don't you make sure you do it right?  That's all we ask.  All right.  Yeah.  Wear a cup.  We don't want a dead head.  Do it the right way.  What's the fun?  What's the fun in that?  Yeah.  That was great.  Bite her cunt later.  All right, I will.  Yeah.  He'll do things to me that he wouldn't do in the studio.  Look how white and ashen he looks.  Hold on, he'll do things to you like he wouldn't do in the studio, like what?  Like be sweet?  No, like totally bite my cunt off.  Yeah.  Does he tool you in the ass?  I did it once by accident. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah.  Jammed it in there.  It was wonderful.  It was a little oopsie.  By accident?  Yeah.  It was a hell of an accident.  We were having a very bloody period sex, which was great.  You like period sex?  Oh, it's great.  Oh, he loves it.  Blood is a ridiculous...  Awesome.  It looked like a crime scene.  Yeah, like I'm killing her.  Pat is earthy.  So I can't fuck on the period.  Do you eat pussy on the period?  Oh, I would, yeah.  Wow, okay.  Yeah.  And you like it messy?  Yeah.  The heavier your flow, the better.  Wow.  I really like blood. 
[04:06:30]  It's just that simple.  Blood from anywhere is good.  It's not like a thing.  I don't mind, but it's not like something I go like, oh, I'm glad.  I can't do it.  I have more.  Can't do it.  More blood.  He was really excited.  Oh, my God.  That was great.  He was really good at once, but he was very excited.  Yeah.  So you were fucking...  Do you want to bleed too in bed?  If it happens, it happens.  All right.  So...  You'd murder somebody that, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah, I can see that.  Yeah.  I came really close to murdering Sam one time.  Really close.  Yeah, but you guys good now? 
[04:07:00]  You're all right?  No.  You got to be good.  He's like a crazy person.  Really.  How can we have to work things out?  What happened?  It's fine.  It's fine.  As he gives him an evil look, you stop Pat.  Because I'm waiting for him to say something.  Because Pat's crazy.  Because after an apology and don't worry, you're not in trouble, and it was just for the air,  for whatever reason, he still thinks I'm picking on him when I've barely even talked  to him.  He's nuts.  Yes.  It's apparently in my head.  All right.  Sorry.  Well, let's thank Pat Duffy for once again helping out the radio show. 
[04:07:30]  Thank you.  Yes.  Are you closer to being hired?  Maybe.  Anything.  Why would we hire a freak like...  We don't know if we're going to be hired.  We'll send the tape to Mel and see what he says.  He enjoys it.  I had no idea that these two were having sex.  Yeah.  No idea.  Oh, yeah.  That was kind of a known thing.  And you still wouldn't know after watching that.  No kidding.  Beating each other up.  Jesus Christ.  Some sick shit. 
[04:08:00]  We bumped into something today.  I'm going to go pet my balls gently in the men's room.  Yeah.  I got to make pee-pee.  We got to do line of the day and we'll just leave.  Shit.  I got to make pee-pee.  Let's go to line of the day and get out of here.  How many are there?  We can't beat that.  We can.  I had some political...  Oh, my God.  It's 11.23?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  See how late?  Hold up half the show.  It was great.  Good job, guys.  It's because we did an extended little tour over there at CBS.  It's cool.  I'm glad K-Rock heard it.  It's because BCN surprisingly dumped out of it.  It didn't do it.  But that's all right. 
[04:08:30]  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's run through these.  I got to piss.  I'm doing a pee-pee dance.  Carbonite.  Carbonite.  Carbonite.  Carbonite.  Carbonite.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any  of your files.  Check it out at Carbonite.com.  Promo code XM.  How many runner-ups?  Well, we'll just start.  Here's our runner-up line of the day.  I've never been that hungry that I tried to drink from somebody that wasn't a human.  Dude, I thought you were my mom.  Dude.  You know what, dude?  I'm under the yacht.  All these people are trying to help me. 
[04:09:00]  Dude.  All right.  I think it's time to get rid of line of the day.  No.  That was funny and all, but you never get the reaction from the people out there because  it's out of context.  It's not about them, though.  It's about the other people out there.  The people that actually heard it and said, I remember that moment.  But, you know, if you watch the end of Chips and just saw the freeze frame portions, you  wouldn't know what went on.  But if you watch the episode, you go, oh, that was the time that Ponch was trying to 
[04:09:30]  pick up that chick.  And then John leaned back and kind of laughed, and then they freeze the frame there.  It's a reward for listening longer.  Right.  That's where Ponch was trying to re-whiten his teeth with more of John's cum.  That's right.  I said that.  Yes, you did.  Yuck.  That kick was the most disturbing thing I've seen on the radio.  I heard.  I heard that fucking whammo.  That fucking...  That sounded loud. 
[04:10:00]  All right, let's go to the next runner-up line of the day.  By the way...  Yes, by the way, Pat Duffy, you are exactly Pat Duffy's type.  I have a thing for giganticism.  No, that's not even right.  And he gets the runner-up line of the day.  Yeah.  Where's he going?  There's nothing this kid can't do.  How dumb is field hockey?  Oh, field hockey's amazing.  But you don't know what to do in chess.  It's amazing because the girls have to bend down all the time to get to the ball.  That's not bad, but...  A bunch of fucking lesbians playing field hockey. 
[04:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Who wants to see that?  This is mullet central right here.  That's awful.  A pervert came up with this game.  Yeah.  Because why wouldn't they just give them the largest sticks so they don't have to bend  down so much?  Yeah, that's a good point.  In hockey, they don't have to bend down, but girls in skirts, make them bend down and  hit the ball around.  Brilliant.  The gym teacher...  They all look the same.  Yeah.  They look the same face and everything.  What happened?  Another dumb Olympic sport.  Okay, another runner-up line of the day.  Get to the spot.  How the hell do you find that out? 
[04:11:00]  Yeah, how do you...  These...  The old foot race?  No, the old belly flop onto the floor test.  You know, I remember what that was for.  Yeah, we were talking about...  We can say this a little more liberally.  We were talking about a girl having a period, and how could you tell?  Nice.  And I was saying that she'd belly flop...  On the floor.  And her vag would open like a mouth spitting.  It would look like Gene Simmons during God of Thunder.  I'm going to be at Trump Marina. 
[04:11:30]  When?  Vinny.  That is.  Plug to it.  Saturday.  Tomorrow.  Vinny's bonner.  Trump Marina.  Yeah, I'm falling asleep now.  Trump Marina, August 23rd.  Tomorrow.  I'm doing this every fucking day.  Yeah.  Runner-up line of the day.  Here's another one.  This is our boss.  Is that who that is?  I thought it was Ricky Gervais.  Wow.  Goddamn, that was good.  Very nice.  When our GM walked in.  Yeah.  I didn't mean it.  Yeah, I guess you did.  I think she likes the clam.  Whoa, stop. 
[04:12:00]  I know you're talking about seafood.  Yes, of course I am.  Wow.  It goes nice with the beer.  She obviously drinks.  Sure, that's what you meant.  Line of the day time.  Vinny Brand from the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, man.  Thanks to the crowd.  That seemed to be growing as the show went on.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  And the K-Rock girls.  Yeah.  They're very lovely.  Yeah.  Oh, the winners.  Congratulations all.  Sure.  That's right.  Yes.  Here is your line of the day. 
[04:12:30]  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Give me one more.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One more.  You're crazy.  Wait.  Good audio.  Hold on.  All phones.  We'll tell you one.  All right, guys.  Here she goes.  Go. 
[04:13:00]  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Yes.  With that.  Line of the day is a thud.  That's great.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys on Monday.  Monday.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Hey, this is intern Pat Duffy, and you're listening to me Desperately Seek Attention.  I'm Opie and Anthony. 
[04:13:30]  A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore.  She'll reach around and get you off with her hand.  All the while, she'll lick your spot by your tiny balloon knot.  Hope you didn't eat too much bran.  A rusty trombone may not be moral.  While I think this sounds kind of gay, I'd rather get some oral with the finger up my butt. 
[04:14:00]  But that's me, what the hell, I'm a nut.  Come on, honey, start the music.  Yeah.  You play that well. </pre>
