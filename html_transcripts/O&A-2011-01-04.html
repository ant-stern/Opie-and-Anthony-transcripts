<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious condemnation of Mayor Bloomberg's handling of a massive post-blizzard garbage pile-up in New York City.  Opie and Anthony used highly offensive language to describe the Mayor, blaming him for prioritizing Broadway cleanliness over residential areas and citing a sanitation worker slowdown as a contributing factor.  A sanitation supervisor, Butch, called in to explain the situation, attributing the problems to budget cuts under Deputy Mayor Goldschmidt, resulting in insufficient equipment and inexperienced workers.  This led to a broader discussion about high costs and poor services in New York City, including parking fees, subway fares, and tolls.  They even recounted a bizarre story of a man surviving a suicide attempt by landing in a pile of garbage.

The conversation then took a sharp turn, with Opie recounting graphic and offensive details from episodes of A&E’s *Intervention* and *Hoarders*.  He described an *Intervention* episode involving a "hot meth whore" and a cuckolded husband, and a *Hoarders* episode featuring a woman who hoarded animals in extremely unsanitary conditions, using highly offensive and graphic language to describe both the woman and her situation. A caller then shared a similar anecdote about Long Island sanitation workers’ pay.  The segment concluded with further discussion of *Beyond Scared Straight* and recollections of the original series.

The next segment focused on three distinct topics: *Beyond Scared Straight*, Brett Favre's legal troubles involving alleged inappropriate text messages and sexual harassment accusations, and a mass bird and fish die-off in Arkansas. The *Beyond Scared Straight* discussion centered on a clip featuring intense and profane confrontations between inmates and juvenile delinquents, highlighted by a memorable offensive line.  The hosts speculated on the show's continued use of harsh language.  One host jokingly claimed past experience with a "Scared Straight" program.

The Brett Favre segment detailed the lawsuit against him by two massage therapists alleging sexually suggestive text messages, including one offering a picture of his penis. The hosts engaged in graphic and vulgar commentary about Favre's penis and the situation.  The upcoming appearance of Deadspin's editor-in-chief was announced. The Arkansas bird and fish die-off segment involved a discussion of various conspiracy theories, including Alex Jones's suggestion of government involvement ("chemtrails"). Guest Troy Kwan initially supported this, later admitting a lack of research. The hosts discussed various theories with a mix of seriousness and humor, referencing swamp gas, UFOs, and a Monty Python sketch. A phone call with Alex Jones provided his perspective and further conspiracy theories, including government experimentation, population control, and the alleged plans of global elites.  Artificial rain in Abu Dhabi was also discussed.  The call was interrupted several times and ended lightheartedly.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about a Hepatitis A outbreak potentially linked to communion wafers at a Massapequa church.  This segued into a criticism of Jay Thomas for airing commercials on their channel while refusing to allow a guest, Ira, on the show.  A listener then criticized Jimmy Norton’s comedic style, alleging gratuitous use of sexually explicit language.  Norton defended himself, claiming factual accuracy and comedic intent.  This led to a heated exchange with the caller and further listener calls criticizing Norton's humor.  The conversation then shifted to clips from the 1978 version of *Scared Straight*, highlighting the graphic and profane language.  The hosts discussed the contrast between the original and the anticipated A&E version.  More clips were played, showcasing the convicts' harsh and violent language and descriptions of prison life, including sexual assault and exploitation.  The discussion returned to the listener criticism of Norton, followed by discussions of a *Rickroll* remix, a Hyundai commercial, and finally, a phone interview with A.J. from Deadspin.com about the Brett Favre sexting scandal, focusing on Deadspin's coverage and speculation on Jen Sterger’s motivations. The interview touched upon other potential Deadspin stories, including a possible photo of a Ryder Cup captain.

The final segment focused on the prevalence of athletes sending unsolicited dick pics and the media coverage, referencing the Tiger Woods scandal.  The hosts discussed their own past exploits, including obtaining and broadcasting a Boston Celtics player's voicemails and uncovering details about Rex Ryan's wife's online presence, leading to revelations about their unconventional relationship.  AJ from Deadspin joined the discussion, explaining Deadspin's focus and mentioning a long-term investigative piece on how Magic Johnson contracted AIDS, focusing on rumors of involvement in transsexual parties.  The hosts speculated on Magic Johnson's sexual activity and its potential connection to his AIDS diagnosis.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the planned removal of the N-word from a new edition of *Huckleberry Finn*, the hosts expressing displeasure and suggesting absurd replacements, alongside numerous offensive jokes and comments on race, sexuality, and other topics.  The show ended with a humorous promotion of a fictional audiobook project.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Wake the fuck up!  What the fuck is going on?!  We're waking you up.  You ought to love it.  It's a privilege to hear our voices.  This is so cool.  This is fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah!  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy, the next minute you're acting like a big giant ass.  He's got a ton of fire!  Oh my god!  It's fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rape.  Yeah, it's amazing. 
[00:00:30]  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Hello, everybody!  Uh, good morning.  I want to say something to the mayor of New York City.  Oh?  Clean up our fucking garbage!  Uh, yeah, drive it in.  You don't live here, Anthony.  You don't live here. 
[00:01:00]  Well, I drive in, so...  This place is starting to stink to high heaven.  When I drive in, I, uh, I see the carnage on the other side of the road, so...  There's, uh, mountains of garbage in New York City at this point.  Yes.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think I pay my city taxes.  Fucking Mayor Bloomberg should be out there himself fucking, uh, pulling away garbage bags at this point.  You must not...  Do something.  You must not pay enough taxes.  The fuck?  Your city taxes.  The snow removal was a nightmare because the sanitation department had a slowdown. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  They don't want to say that.  No one really wants to say that.  And I'm not picking sides, but the fact is they had a slowdown for whatever reason, okay?  But the mayor's not brave enough to say that shit.  And then on top of it, now we got piles and piles of garbage because now they finally were clearing away the snow.  Yeah.  They finally got some of the snow away.  And the garbage reared its ugly head underneath.  Right.  And, uh...  Piles, man. 
[00:02:00]  It stinks out there.  It's literally, I mean, walls of garbage.  Yeah.  They're piled up in garbage bags as, uh...  Big black garbage bags.  That are, um...  Some of them I've seen were, like, 10, 15 feet high.  Well, we were so busy yesterday, we didn't get to this one story.  There's so much garbage on the streets.  This is a true story, by the way, what you're about to hear.  A guy was committing suicide and jumped.  Yeah, jumped out of the garbage.  And survived because he landed on the fucking garbage bags. 
[00:02:30]  That's in a pile of garbage.  Like it was an airbag.  That's how much garbage is in the streets right now.  And this stupid mayor with his dumb fucking cold speaking Spanish every once in a while  Clean up my fucking garbage.  I pay my taxes.  Enough.  Well, you have, like, the little bike lanes.  That's what's important.  Oh, yeah.  They were nice and clean.  That's where the money should go.  They were nice and clean right after the storm.  Yeah, they cleaned up the pedestrian mall there in Times Square.  That was clear.  Because, you know, you've got to get the people in there.  Because he hates...  I'm telling you.  He fucking has such a shit attitude towards the middle class and people that have to drive and work. 
[00:03:00]  He's fucking horrible.  He's so smug.  He's a smug, rich guy.  He's a smug asshole.  Yeah.  He's being glib.  He's a fucking asshole.  He's a whist.  This guy...  Now, we had this blizzard, 18 inches.  We didn't really talk about this yesterday.  And the mayor gets on his first press conference.  He actually says, well, Broadway is nice and clean.  And there's a good opportunity to see a Broadway show.  Because a lot of these shows are sold out all year long. 
[00:03:30]  And a lot of these people aren't going to be able to get to their Broadway show.  So, if you're local, you'll be able to see some of these plays and shows you normally wouldn't see.  Right.  And then you've got people in the Bronx and Queens and Staten Island and Brooklyn that have been housebound.  Not anymore, obviously.  But were housebound up to five days.  And this stupid fucking mayor, that's what he's talking about.  Go see a Broadway show.  Five days of just being fucked.  Because the sanitation department had a work slowdown.  Yeah.  And like I said, I'm not picking sides, but someone at least has to say it and stop beating around the fucking bush. 
[00:04:00]  If they slowed down cleanup on purpose, then you have to, the only sides are they should be fucking fired immediately.  They don't like the concessions they had to make, the union.  They don't like that they, you know, got some pay cuts and furloughs and things like that.  So, they decided, ah, go fuck yourselves.  We're just not going to, we're not going to do our job.  Right.  Well, then fire them and give the job to somebody who'll do it.  I don't blame them for being pissed off, but you can't fucking put people in danger by not plowing the streets. 
[00:04:30]  No.  Well, you need a mayor that's a little tougher, though.  At least fucking.  Oh, he's the worst.  At least call him out on it.  Instead, he's talking like this.  He's got stuff he knows.  During his press conferences.  He has such a puke.  I hate him.  Rudy couldn't stay.  I'm not a fan of fucking Bloomberg.  Rudy couldn't stay after 9-11 because the system and democracy had to continue.  Yet this fucking, this dweeb did some backdoor shit and got himself another term.  He stinks. 
[00:05:00]  And, you know, the mayor of Newark, same blizzard, right?  And, you know, it was a tough cleanup, obviously.  But we've had a lot of these in the past, and it was never this bad.  And the mayor of Newark went out there in his stupid sweatpants and said,  Look, I've got to at least show something.  Yeah.  And he's pushing cars out of snow drifts, and he's shoveling a little bit.  Just showing, I'm the mayor, and I know this is a rough situation.  I'll at least go out there and make it look good for an afternoon. 
[00:05:30]  And that's what he did.  Yeah.  So I'm saying to Mayor Bloomberg, get your fucking sweatpants on and start hauling garbage away.  The place stinks.  I don't think you're going to see that.  Because he's an entitled douchebag.  I don't think you're going to be seeing that.  He's running New York City like it's Sim City.  It's his little fucking private game.  It really is.  Really?  But enough, man.  The garbage piles.  It's unbelievable.  I don't remember ever seeing it like this.  I think when we first moved to New York, there was something going on. 
[00:06:00]  There were piles of garbage, I remember.  And that was like kind of in the summertime.  Remember?  Probably a strike.  Up and down 57th Street, there were mountains of garbage bags.  And the rats are coming.  The rats are coming.  They're coming and nipping at this point.  It is a little cold for the rats.  They'll come out, though.  Which is good.  There's a lot of food out there for them.  Yeah, but the cold keeps them pretty much subterranean.  You think?  Yeah.  We're lucky in LA?  Yeah, very lucky.  If this was the middle of the summer, you think we'd see rats just everywhere at this point? 
[00:06:30]  After a snowstorm?  No, I mean the piles of garbage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  It would be sick.  You think?  Oh!  Yeah.  Let me...  Oh, there'd be plague, pestilence.  Let me say hi to Butch.  Sanitation supervisor.  Butch, New York City.  What's up, brother?  Yeah, what's up, all night?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  That's bullshit that we had at work stop.  It just slowed down.  That's full of shit.  We've been doing this for a hundred fucking years, and we never had a problem like this.  So what?  I can't get these fucking guys to listen to me on a regular day. 
[00:07:00]  I guess you weren't in on what was going on.  So what happened this year?  Everyone?  Huh?  The equipment sucks.  They got a new deputy mayor who's too fucking cheap to put guys in on Saturday to get the equipment ready.  They got guys with fucking two days on the job driving the equipment.  They panicked, and they fired.  They demoted 50 supervisors because they didn't want to put on 50 fucking...  And they're making new guys to drive the equipment. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I don't know what to say.  See, this is what's going on.  You call them out on it, and then they say no.  No fucking way.  But then what does...  You guys have a slowdown on one of those shitty shows eight times a day.  I don't call up and complain about that.  We're having a work slowdown.  We've been having a work slowdown for five years.  A work slowdown.  And the hiring labor is still today for fucking $20 an hour to come chip away at the sidewalks. 
[00:08:00]  All right, Butch.  Fair enough.  Then who do we blame?  I want one person to blame.  Huh?  Deputy Mayor Goldschmidt.  I'm going with Goldschmidt.  Goldschmidt.  Goldschmidt.  There you go.  Oh, no.  You guys rock.  All right, man.  Of course we do.  If you have open minds, if that's what you're saying, then all right, now I'm all pissed off  at the Deputy Mayor of New York City.  You're looking out, man.  Thanks, Butch.  All right.  All I know is, man, if you pay your city fucking taxes, you shouldn't have to deal with any  of this shit ever.  Wow.  Work out your bullshit problems behind closed doors and not get the people involved like 
[00:08:30]  they are.  Good luck.  People were stuck on trains for two days, and it was a complete mess.  And what do they do?  They raise the rates of everything across the board the day after the fucking blizzard.  Oh, yeah.  I saw the, going through the tunnel, it says new tunnel rates.  It's unbelievable.  Yes.  Look, it doesn't affect us, thank God.  I'm, you know, I'm very thankful that I make enough money, but I can't imagine how these  people are affording to get in and out of the city at this point. 
[00:09:00]  It is amazing.  Just.  Isn't a subway ride up to $2.50 now?  I don't know.  It's, uh.  When we first came back to New York, it was still, I think it was under a dollar still.  Yeah, it's $2.50.  Really?  It's $2.50 one way.  That used to be a cab ride.  It's like $110 for a monthly pass now?  Oh.  Who the fuck could afford that if you're not making a shitload of money?  How the hell do you do that?  I don't know what they're fucking doing with this city.  And the cutbacks on service, so you're getting shit service, paying more for it. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, but we don't get cutbacks on what we have to pay.  I never understand that.  No.  Where's our cutbacks?  Like, if we make a mistake, it doesn't matter.  They actually charge you more, right?  But if they make a mistake, like they don't plow your streets or pick up your garbage, they  don't give you a little kickback going, sorry.  Yeah.  Sorry we fucked up.  But if you fuck up, right?  That's always the way.  They make sure they get a little more money out of your pocket.  Same thing with taxes.  If you're late with your taxes, you know what happens. 
[00:10:00]  And then if they're late giving you a refund, you try to ask them for interest on that.  Unbelievable.  You know, someone's got to help me out with this one, but you feed the meters?  Yeah.  It used to be a quarter was 15 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  That's freaking out people right now that live other places.  Yeah.  A quarter was 15 minutes, okay?  That was ridiculous.  So it was a dollar an hour.  Then it went down to, I think, a quarter for 10 minutes. 
[00:10:30]  Somebody help me.  Now it's even less now.  You're getting less time for every quarter.  You could pay 50 cents for 10 minutes in certain areas.  It's fucking sick.  You're paying 50 cents for 10 minutes in certain areas.  Yeah.  Because they did say in some shopping areas it's really bad.  Yeah, Broadway.  So you're barely getting any time on the meter for a quarter now.  What the fuck is that about?  Yeah.  Where's all this money going?  You can't do anything.  It's not like you can go and do something for that short amount of time that you're parked there. 
[00:11:00]  No.  And you can only feed it for an hour, too, by the way, for the people listening elsewhere.  25 cents will get you 15 minutes now.  Just a...  No.  Yeah.  I'm reading an article that they just raised it.  25 cents...  25 cents will now get drivers 15 minutes of parking time down from 20 minutes.  This is an article in yesterday's.  So then something's fucked up because the area I live in, it was already down to 15 minutes.  South of 86th Street, it's $3 an hour. 
[00:11:30]  South of 86th Street, it's $3 an hour.  For the rest of the city, 25 cents will now buy drivers 15 minutes of parking.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm talking about where I live.  So now it's up to $3 an hour of quarters.  Yeah.  And they don't even give you the luxury of giving you two hours so you don't have to keep feeding the fucking meter.  How do they just...  And an hour in New York City is like that.  Yeah.  It's in New York minutes a lot faster.  Right.  So where's all that money?  I know we've done this fucking break a million times, but someone's got to keep doing this break. 
[00:12:00]  Where the fuck is all this money?  It's being misappropriated.  It's being taken away.  It's being skimmed.  What's your tunnel up to?  I know you've got Easy Pass, but do you know?  Six-something, right?  Each way, right?  Midtown is each way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Midtown, each way.  Six-something each fucking way.  Yeah.  So you're an average Joe driving work.  Now it's costing you $12 just to get in the city, you know, back and forth. 
[00:12:30]  And then you've got to take the Queensborough.  And then you've got to park the car.  Let's not even talk about these fucking parking garages and what they get away with.  It's armed robbery, I tell you.  It's like if you park before 5 a.m. for an hour, it's $10.  If you park at 5.05, it'll cost you $52.  It's never what's on the sign.  The signs always look good.  Yeah.  But as soon as you pull that car in, you're fucking broke.  And let's not forget about special New York City parking tax, which doesn't exist anywhere else. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which is like 18% parking tax.  To park in the garage of my building, you have to get something that says you're a resident where you only pay 10%.  But it's fucking repulsive.  Oh, God.  It really is repulsive.  Repulsive.  And you're paying for the parking.  And the parking garage that is collecting the money is paying a tax on that money.  And you've been taxed on the money you're paying with.  Yeah.  And then they throw in that parking tax.  Yeah.  It's just multiple layers of tax. 
[00:13:30]  And you have a big truck.  What about an oversized vehicle fee?  An oversized vehicle fee.  Don't forget about event rates.  Hold on.  Event rates.  If you want to park anywhere near anything, you've got to pay an event rate.  And Ant does have an oversized vehicle.  Of course I do.  My car is officially oversized.  Yeah.  And it's one of the smaller SUV trucks.  I've never had it in the oversized vehicle category.  But they have changed that.  It's...  They changed the definition of that.  Yeah.  If it isn't a car, it's an oversized vehicle. 
[00:14:00]  If it isn't one of those tiny little, what do they call it, the fucking...  The little Prius.  The Mini Coops.  A Mini Cooper.  A Mini Cooper.  It's now an oversized vehicle.  Yeah.  Just fucking...  Oh, the smart car.  I want to fucking run those things over when I see them.  When you see them.  Just shut up.  Who the fuck would ride in one of those?  You get broadsided in one of those things.  You're so dead.  At least with a motorcycle, you can maybe make a move or two before you get creamed.  When you stop to the light and you see that thing just puttering through the intersection, 
[00:14:30]  I look just going...  I just...  Oh, my God.  They're so dead.  We need a reset, man, in this country.  We're long past a reset.  We need a complete and utter reset.  A reboot.  Because your point is a great one, where the amount of taxes they take out of the same  money is...  It's mind-boggling.  It's the same money, multiple layers of tax, and that'll just fuck us over.  Unbelievable. 
[00:15:00]  But our shit went up again here in New York City, so...  And with that, we get piles of garbage, and the mayor just sitting there going,  oh, it's going to take time to clean up.  Well, we needed him again.  We couldn't have done it without him.  We needed him again.  Well, just...  I would love to go to the mayor.  Well, it's going to take time for me to collect all my fucking tax money, so bear with me.  No.  You would get killed with fees.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, that didn't look good.  They got a crash test with one of those mini cars?  Crash tests on these little smart cars. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, you would survive that.  Oh, yeah.  Look at it.  When the door caves in, that airbag ain't helping you at all.  Oh, your whole left side would be shot.  The side airbag is not helping you.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  It's one of these little driving around England, those little tiny road cars.  Yeah.  It's the car that, like, Mr. Bean would drive around in.  Yes.  Yeah.  Fuck Mr. Bean's car.  I never got that fucking guy, ever.  Let me go to Chris in New York. 
[00:16:00]  He's funny for ten minutes.  Chris, what's going on, buddy?  Chuckle.  What's going on, fellas?  Good morning.  How are you?  All right.  You know, that guy Butch was right about one thing.  It is the deputy mayor.  You know, he's the one who kind of deals with the civil servants.  But this guy is a fucking hatchet man.  He's an assassin.  He was the former mayor of Indianapolis, Indiana.  And anybody from Indianapolis knows him.  His claim to fame was he cut, fired, or privatized everything.  Over there.  He's here to cut budgets.  He's here to save money. 
[00:16:30]  And this is what you get when you do that.  You get shitty streets.  But our point, me and Ann and Jimmy's point for years now is, why do you need to cut the  fucking money?  You're making enough.  You're spending it the wrong way.  Because the retarded mayor decided to turn Times Square, which was the crossroads of  the world to a lot of stores, into a fucking flea market.  Does it make less money now, though?  Because it is always crowded.  Like, it's mobs whenever I go down there.  It's got to be making a shitload of money. 
[00:17:00]  Who the fuck is sitting down there all day long?  People who don't spend fucking money.  It's the same people who spend it sitting at Starbucks all day.  Well, that's true.  They're just sitting there.  I don't know what they're buying.  You know?  Mm.  And, you know, but listen, if it wasn't worth slowdown, then fuck you anyway, because I'm  a paramedic.  So I'm the other service that Bloomberg tried to bastardize throughout this whole thing.  Apparently, it was our fault that the ambulances got stuck in the snow.  Right.  Okay.  So there's been so many cuts that they finally got caught with their pants down. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  I'm going with that now.  That's what I think.  Because when you do play...  I'm going with that one.  When you do play SimCity, when you cut down on the budgets of a lot of the fire, police,  power, plumbing, things like that, you will notice things start breaking.  And you'll notice all you're doing is putting out fires.  How close are we to just running around in circles peeing ourselves?  Yeah, just running around, all mad and angry. 
[00:18:00]  Are we a week or two away from that in New York City?  The approval level going down.  Yeah, I think we're really close to that.  I think we have to lock the mayor in a room with no way out.  Well, look on the bright side.  If you're going to piss yourself or whatever, that little hand-shaped bench that's in the  middle of Times Square, that thing was plowed out.  So you can actually take a shit on that thing.  Oh, very good.  Very good.  Thank you.  That's nice.  Now, I blame the hatchet man now.  We're all looking at the hatchet man.  Chris on Long Island. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, Chris.  Hey, how you going, guys?  What's up?  Happy New Year.  I don't know if Chris is still on the line or if Butch is still listening, but I got  some friends who work for a town out here on Long Island, sanitation.  And I know that they busted their ass during the snow.  That's blood money.  I mean, it comes to a point after like 13, 14 hours of power tonight that it's almost  not worth it to be driving.  But those two Fridays that most people have as holidays, the day before Christmas, day  before New Year's, I got a buddy who went in for like three hours. 
[00:19:00]  I got paid for 25 each of those days.  There's your fucking problem.  Well, I don't know what the problem is.  I just know we're doing our part and they keep wanting more and more money from us.  When does it end?  When the fuck does it end?  Anytime you see one of these projects come up, these politicians, little pet projects,  they're always way over budget.  And whenever anybody takes a little magnifying glass to them, they realize that they've been  ripped off severely by the contractors and whatnot. 
[00:19:30]  It's amazing.  It is amazing.  I'm a union guy, but I'm not a public union guy.  I work for Verizon.  So it's kind of different.  I'm protecting myself from the corporation.  And my blood boils when you talk about the unions, Anthony.  But I tell you, when I started hearing my buddy talk about that shit, I'm like, this  is exactly why our local taxes are through the fucking roof.  You're getting paid for 25 hours to go in for three.  And what are you really doing at three fucking hours?  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  So why would he get paid for 25 hours?  Oh, sorry.  What's that?  Why would someone get paid for 25 hours and only go in for three?  Why would he tell me?  No, no.  Why would someone get paid for 25 hours?  Well, it's the union.  It's a holiday.  Those two fines are considered holidays and most union contracts because the holiday fell  on Saturday.  If it falls on a Sunday, you get the Monday off.  In my job, if I go into work on a holiday, I hit double time.  Yeah.  That stuff has been going on forever.  Right.  I'm working eight hours. 
[00:20:30]  I'm getting paid another.  I'm getting paid for 16.  Right on.  Not three for 25.  Jeez.  There you go.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Chris.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  I'm not pointing the finger at unions or any of that shit.  I'm pointing it at our officials.  They have to figure this shit out.  We're paying our shit.  And now we've got garbage piling up.  All the local news is all over the garbage piles.  But that's just it.  It's like trying to find, you know, when something goes awry in here and we try to find who was  responsible. 
[00:21:00]  You can't.  And there's never a single name to anything.  It's this entity.  It's this upstairs.  Somebody said that.  That's what it is.  There's never any accountability.  The politicians will blame it on the workforce and the unions.  And the unions and the workforce blame it on the politicians.  It's so so nobody really knows who who's to blame.  That's why I did that little exercise.  You see that there was everyone was blaming each other.  Blame each other.  You're pointing.  I don't know.  You pass the buck.  I'm still playing blaming the mayor. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  It's his job to figure all this shit out.  Yeah.  I just know that I pay my fucking city taxes and I want my garbage fucking hauled away.  Paying your taxes doesn't mean shit anymore.  Of course.  Paying your taxes doesn't mean you're going to get the services you're supposed to get.  Paying your taxes means you won't go to jail.  Right.  You're paying to stay out of prison is what you're paying for.  Wow.  So you're not paying for a pothole being fixed.  You know, they'll get around to it maybe if they want to. 
[00:22:00]  But you're paying to stay out of prison.  When the fuck did the tax law become that?  Yeah.  It's really reason and cause for an uprising and a legitimate revolution.  Right.  That will never happen because we've just been turned into complete faggots.  And not even because it might not even be our fault because there's, like I said, so many layers of government and taxes that you don't even know who to attack. 
[00:22:30]  And I don't mean attack militarily.  I mean just even attack with fucking emails.  Who do you talk to?  I barely even blame the lawmakers at this point because I think they don't even know what the fuck they're doing.  No, that tax code.  They've never read it.  They don't know what it means.  They don't know what half this shit means.  Charlie Cox Suck Fuck Dick Wrangel.  That's his name as far as I'm concerned and a couple of other words that I'm not going to use. 
[00:23:00]  But that motherfucker was in charge of writing the goddamn tax laws.  And he didn't pay his fucking taxes.  What does that say?  What does that say?  Because he said he didn't even know he had to.  You wrote the laws, you fucking idiot.  That's what we're dealing with.  That's a prime example.  There you go.  Are we on top of it?  Garbage pickup resumes.  So they're going to start cleaning up the fucking piles of garbage that is everywhere at this point. 
[00:23:30]  You can't even get through some of those sidewalks.  No, look at that.  They're just full of garbage.  The rats are coming, I'm telling you.  And it's going to be a little warmer today, Ann.  So your theory of the rats staying underground.  I think we see a few rats today.  It's going to be in the 40s.  So I think rats will deal with the 40s if they can get some leftovers from one of those bags.  Stop biting people.  Please turn them into zombies.  It would be great.  Who's this fuckwad?  That's my old lawyer.  That's your old lawyer?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a fuckwad.  He's the karaoke guy from my old bar.  He's a natural politician.  Oh, is he? 
[00:24:00]  Now he's a politician.  Of course, if that doesn't say a lot.  He's the expert about the garbage piles.  Thanks, Dan.  That's Dan, the garbage guy.  Yeah, he represented me when I got into trouble.  Send us your pictures and video of trash piling up.  Look at that pile is higher than the guy walking down the street.  Yeah.  Clean up our garbage.  Well, they're out there with the trucks today.  I saw that when I was driving in.  Good luck, though.  I like this one, Ann. 
[00:24:30]  I've done this one, the Long Island Railroad.  Yeah.  Greg and Tony checking in from Lake Grove.  He says, I took the Long Island Railroad into the city last weekend.  How to buy a ticket on the train.  This happens to a lot of us because you're in a hurry, right?  Oh, right.  And the Long Island Railroad knows that a lot of times you're in a hurry.  And you can't wait on line, by the way, to get your ticket.  So you have no choice.  Mm-hmm.  So you go on the train without a ticket.  They charge $6 extra for buying a ticket on the train.  Yeah.  I've seen that.  And the funny thing is about that, which brings my theory home. 
[00:25:00]  Now, you go on the train with a regular ticket, okay, that you already bought, and you get  on the train, there's no fucking seat for you because they shove everybody in, especially  during the rush hour.  Go to the conductor and go, hey, I want a few bucks back because I bought my ticket and  I can't sit fucking down for the next hour.  They'll laugh at you.  Sorry, we don't do that.  If you get on the train and you don't have a ticket, they want more money from you.  More money.  It only works one way.  Always.  And you won't get the seat.  Why doesn't it work the other way?  If they can't find me a fucking seat, they should give you a few bucks back. 
[00:25:30]  Did you mention how sometimes the ticket stations are closed, so you kind of just have to buy  your ticket on the train?  Yeah.  I will say one thing, though.  I do like those machines.  Anytime I could use a machine and not deal with human fuck beings, I am in heaven.  Slide a credit card in there, zip, zip, press a few buttons, the ticket comes out.  That's how everything should work.  Fucking toll booths, blow me if you're fucking sticking your savage hand out looking for my 
[00:26:00]  toll money.  Easy pass.  Easy pass.  Anytime I don't have to deal with people.  At the bank, give me an ATM any day of the week.  But you're playing into their scam, man.  Man, what am I, leaving a paper trail, man?  I'm on the grid.  I love people that think they are obsessed with being tracked.  They're always the most uninteresting people.  Oh, no one wants to track you. 
[00:26:30]  I don't want them to see where I'm going, why it's boring.  Yeah.  No.  You know what that means?  You don't want your wife knowing where you're going.  That's what that means.  That's legitimate.  Not the fucking government.  You know, the government knows what time I went through that tunnel, man.  Oh, yeah.  To what?  Go home to your lousy fucking wife.  Right.  And have your shit dinner on sex night so you can't play your video game.  Wait a minute.  That's you.  All right.  It got a little personal from the old days. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, there.  It kind of snapped back in my head.  That's very uncomfortable to hear again.  All right.  Enough of this shit, I guess.  Oh, it's disgusting.  It's happening in every city, isn't it?  It's happening in the whole country.  But New York is just completely out of control.  I don't know another city that is this out of control with the amount of money they're just yanking out of our pockets.  It's a giant city.  It's, you know, it's got a big name to it.  So, I guess that's what we're paying for.  Because, again, if you go on vacation somewhere or you're over a relative's house in a state or city far away and you look at the newspaper and see what real estate values are and taxes, you just want to fucking jump off a roof. 
[00:27:30]  You want to fall down and start crying.  You really do.  The amount of money you spend here, what you can get elsewhere is astonishing.  And all you have to do is convince, in my case, my wife, look, we don't need family and friends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to blow off everybody to live like fucking kings.  Like a fucking king. 
[00:28:00]  That's the problem.  We're stuck here because of family and friends, basically.  You know what it is, though?  Well, everywhere you move, you make some friends.  Well, then why are we doing this?  You make some new friends.  Let's move this fucking show to Boulder, Colorado.  And you'd be the shit because you'd have, like, the big fucking palace.  You could buy a mountainside.  You could literally buy a mountain.  You ever go outside the city and all of a sudden, you know, maybe you treat, you know,  dinner for everybody at a restaurant and you're thinking to yourself, New York, all right,  New York, this is going to be, this is going to be at least $300 and $400. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'll take the hit.  No problem.  And then the bill comes back.  It's $120.  You're like, what the fuck?  What is this?  What is this?  Did they leave something off?  What is this?  Is it half off or something?  Quick, pay this and get the fuck out.  We fucked them good.  It's unbelievable what you get for your money elsewhere.  When I, you book a hotel in another city, let's say you're staying for four days, whatever  it is, and you start adding up in your head, you're like, all right, I'll budget this amount  of money for that.  About $250 a day minimum. 
[00:29:00]  And then it's like, okay, that'll be $300.  And you're like, $300 a day?  For four days?  Because it's $250 in New York.  No, $300 for the whole thing.  Like, what?  Yeah.  You know I'm staying for four days.  You start arguing with them.  You know I'm staying for four days.  Right.  You better have my room for the whole, no, that's fine.  And then on top of it, you get something that's called really nice service.  Yes.  Where they smile at you and they keep doing stuff for you and you're like, what the fuck,  dude?  What do you want from me? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  No, this is what I do.  I'm doing my job.  We're just, oh, what is, what is it?  Danny's looking at palatial fucking mountainsides in Boulder, Colorado.  In Boulder.  All right, what are we looking at?  This is a five-bedroom fucking estate.  Like, it looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  It looks like an entire skit.  It looks like the Overlook Hotel.  It looks like some kind of parks building.  Yeah.  You could move into the Overlook Hotel.  Right.  For two and a half, no.  For two and a half million dollars. 
[00:30:00]  Which I know sounds like a lot to a lot of people out there.  It is a lot of money.  But even in, like, the outer boroughs, like Queens and Brooklyn, I mean, there's plenty of two  million dollars.  Let me tell you what, yeah, look at New York and look in some of the really nice areas of  suburbia and see what two and a half million gets you.  Dude, you, it does not get you, it doesn't get you the Overlook fucking hotel.  Look, I went to the real estate thing.  Jimmy went to the real estate thing.  Safe to say, one bedroom in New York City in a nice neighborhood. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Average neighborhood.  Not a shit neighborhood, but an average neighborhood where you feel safe.  Oh, my God.  You're not getting into a one bedroom for less than a half million dollars.  One fucking bedroom.  Oh, please.  If you're lucky.  Well, it's nice that you, that's the way you want to go find a two and a half million  dollar place on Craigslist.  That's the best place to go.  You're never going to have a problem with a two and a half million dollar mansion from Craigslist.  Why not?  It's either that or a fine-to-kill.  Deal with brokers here, Jimmy.  Yes.  Wow, that is amazing.  Yeah, that's what you'll be if you go there. 
[00:31:00]  Broker than you were when you started.  Oh, Chip, that was actually funny.  I know it was.  Oh, sorry, Chip.  Yeah, I'm going to move to Boulder.  I think I'm moving to Boulder.  Damn, dude.  You could find even other cities that aren't in Boulder, because Boulder is probably like  the expensive Colorado place.  Sure, sure.  And you've got to deal with your Colorado winters.  I'm thinking, I don't know, see, it's just, you get what you're looking for.  What the fuck must live in Boulder?  I know. 
[00:31:30]  What are you doing Boulder?  That's just it, too.  It's like, all right, I could live there, and I could live like a king, but it's like,  why do I want to live there?  Exactly.  You live on a shit pile and live like a king.  I'd rather live like a fucking, like an average, a better than average person in New York.  No, in New York.  You're in New York.  But if you can make your money in New York and just be brave enough to move somewhere  else, you would have just the most amazing life.  You're a fucking fool.  If I still lived in Ashland, Mass., I'd be banking.  Oh, boy, you would.  You would be banking. 
[00:32:00]  You'd be banking all that cash.  Sure.  You would own Green Acres at this point.  I know.  I would.  Was it Green Acres?  Green Acres Bar.  Good old Green Acres.  Wano.  Yeah.  I hear from Wano every once in a while.  He still pops on every so often.  He's a Twitter guy.  Let's go to John in Smithtown.  John.  Hey, John.  On a Sunday paper, I'll get like the McDonald's coupons, 99 cents Big Mac, and in the small  print on the bottom, $1.65 in New York City.  So even the coupons, they charge you more. 
[00:32:30]  See?  That's what we're getting at today.  That's what we're getting at.  Even fucking McDonald's.  Fuck wads.  So, this all started because the garbage really is piling up out there.  It's ugly.  Oh, my God.  All right.  What else is going on?  Well, I had a great evening of television last night.  Yeah?  What'd you check out?  Oh, my God.  Between Intervention, not the show, my own family came over. 
[00:33:00]  They were very upset with me.  Did you jump out a window?  Teasing of course.  Did you make that sound like that guy when he was talking to his son?  Yeah.  I, uh...  They all said, none of us love you, man.  That's the sound you made when that guy moved in next door.  See, because he's black.  Where's Greatest Cry Ever? 
[00:33:30]  You have it or do I have it?  I don't know.  It's the Greatest Cry Ever.  Greatest Cry Ever.  I don't have it, though.  Anyway, you're watching Intervention.  I was watching Intervention, and they had a hot meth whore on.  Naked?  Well, no.  Throwing shit on the walls?  She was wearing these little shorts and stuff, and she had big, big tits, and her husband  was like a cuckold.  Ooh, yay.  And she would smoke the meth. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  She would smoke the meth.  And some shots, you know, when they made her up a little bit, she didn't look too bad.  She looked pretty good.  And you can tell, like, she was hot-looking in her youth.  She's married to this real dud.  This real dud of a guy.  And she goes out and fucks other guys.  And then yells at the husband that she gets what she needs from them.  Love and attention.  See, that's her right there.  She's falling into the wall.  I love her already, by the way.  That's her?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  And that's the husband.  And that's the cuckold?  Yeah, the cuckold husband.  Oh.  Turn back.  Maybe we can get a little...  Yeah, go to the beginning.  It's great.  Yeah, this is the...  She's sexy, man.  She's really fucking sexy, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was the hot method.  You would put up with her problems, right?  Yeah.  I encourage them.  I'm so crazy.  Nothing.  Falling into the wall.  Walking around in wearing panties.  I don't see how you're strengthening our relationship.  By being a whore.  I'm lonely.  Let's do some dope. 
[00:35:00]  Nice to hug to say yes.  I don't think so.  I do.  Get your butt in gear and get this turned around for you.  Intervention.  Ooh, tough talk.  Yeah.  It's turned around for you.  You get your butt in gear.  What's he, a fucking high school coach?  Meh.  She could be the hottest intervention girl ever.  That's why she puts up with her husband.  She was a good one.  Yeah, the husband, I don't know what he's...  He's putting up with her because I...  Because she's hot.  No, because she's hot.  They had a kid.  But, yeah.  But she goes out and fucks other guys. 
[00:35:30]  She was like, oh, my boyfriend's here.  Ooh.  And she runs out to the truck.  And she...  Her and her baby were held at gunpoint at one point from one of the Aryan Nation guys.  It was one of the greatest white trash things I'd seen until Hoarders came on afterwards.  Wow.  Which Hoarders?  It was a brand new Hoarders.  You know I can't watch this show.  It's too close to home.  There was a fat...  Fuck, again, just a fat loser cunt that was hoarding, like, chickens and goats. 
[00:36:00]  Aw.  And they were dying.  Animal Hoarders?  Animal Hoarding.  This is the woman.  She's lovely.  Far up, this cunt.  The prognosis for Hannah is very poor.  The worst of any hoarder I've ever worked with.  This isn't fit for anything to live in.  Is she hoarding dead animals?  We can't allow them to continue to suffer like that.  Half of this is...  I don't care what you're telling me.  I'm telling you. 
[00:36:30]  I own it.  You don't.  Correct.  Leave my stuff alone or you'll get the hell out of here.  Hoarders.  Oh.  Marliss.  Oh, shit.  And that was nothing compared to what she did.  She's getting into a fight with her daughter and then animal control comes pulling up and  she's yelling and crying and then the daughter comes up.  I had to get called for at work to come down here because what are you doing to my mama?  She's got a weak heart.  She's got...  And she's got this delicate neck and I just wanted to choke her. 
[00:37:00]  Did you hate her?  Oh, you hated her.  I couldn't tell you.  I couldn't tweet.  I couldn't tweet fast enough.  Fast enough, right?  How much I hated it.  And the other fat fuck that collected bunnies.  They're rabbits.  Call them bunnies.  Would you have...  Bunnies?  Yeah.  That's how the gook laughs.  They're all over his house.  I didn't even think of it.  Bunny.  Fucking bunny. 
[00:37:30]  You go into another room.  They try to turn us into pacifists.  You open the cage.  Hey, nothing beats a piece of pussy except the Indy 500.  A hundred.  It's like, God, God, they're all over the place.  Bunny.  Bunny.  Fuck.  Yeah, and he was another obnoxious fuck.  Just, just, he wouldn't talk to anybody, wouldn't talk to any of the shrinks.  He's flipping the bird to everybody, saying, fuck you.  And his wife is just a fat-ass enabler. 
[00:38:00]  We gotta get clips from the fucking, that old lady, though.  Oh, yeah.  She is the best.  Can we get some clips of that show?  She's just angry.  What should they look for down the hall?  Because I gotta...  Anytime she opens her big, fat maw.  All right, we got a few clips.  That ugly fucking mouth.  And she has Popeye arms.  Would you have been understanding with her in comm?  Like, do you have to...  I don't know.  Even the shrinks had had it with her. 
[00:38:30]  The one guy was like, look, we gotta clear this out for your goats.  You ain't clearing out nothing.  This is my house, and I'm killing you, you fuck.  Oh, she's cursing at everybody.  And then they get everyone together, and it's like, okay, good morning, everybody.  And the poor, got-junk guys gotta stand there and take abuse from this fucking pig.  I hate her.  She is hateable, isn't she?  Oh, she was the most hateable person I'd ever seen on Hoarders.  Really?  Wow.  The most hateable want to kill her. 
[00:39:00]  And that was the psychologist that was on our show, right?  Or psychiatrist.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We get that wrong.  Psychiatrist.  Whatever it is.  The fucking...  The one when the mic is off.  Yeah, I gotta go to some shithole at some other kook's house.  Did she say that right?  Yeah, she did.  It was great.  All right, well.  It was fantastic.  Don't really want to blow up her spot.  She seems very caring on the show.  You know what?  She's a star on that show.  Oh, was it her?  She's not going anywhere.  The one we interviewed?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, she's great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She turned out to be a really cool lady.  She dealt with it, and she's just like, she got fed up with this fucking... 
[00:39:30]  This animal.  The white trash.  Her teeth.  She had eight teeth in her mouth, maybe.  It was a disaster.  You think her vag smelled?  Oh!  Oh, my God.  She's walking in her yard with this walker, and she comes to the door with a cane.  I just want to beat her with her own fucking walker.  And then the husband that collects the bunnies, his wife had an ass that I couldn't even...  I can't even describe it. 
[00:40:00]  It was so huge.  And she's got a cane.  They all can't walk.  They eat too much.  They're fat, lazy, degenerates, mental problems.  Who cares?  Burn the place down.  I always say it.  But it's...  Just nail the door shut.  Why can't I get out of my house?  Pour the kerosene around it, and let it rock.  I think every Hoarders episode should open with them going to the mall, and then everyone  should end with them headed back towards their house going, why are there firetrucks headed 
[00:40:30]  towards where I live?  Fillowing pile of smoke.  Go put it out with your fucking fat tits, idiot.  They're all fucked up, too.  They showed the one woman is doling out her daily pills in those little pill compartment  things, and there had to be two dozen pills that she's got to take because of the shit. 
[00:41:00]  There was rabbit shit all over the floor to the point where it looked like soil on the  floor that was piled up.  And the landlord came over and saw the house, and he's just like, oh my god, the rabbits  are eating holes through the walls, eating the wires.  And then the guy is just like, you know, I'm leaving.  I don't need to talk to the landlord.  I don't want to even see him.  He's a belligerent.  And it's like, it's your fault, you dummy.  And they try...  They're constantly blaming everyone else... 
[00:41:30]  Except themselves.  ...for what the fuck situation they're in.  That's always the case.  Oh, me, me, me.  You want one of these me, me, me people to actually realize it's, you know, they're the  problem?  That's never going to happen.  I literally, I wanted to beat that fat woman with her own walker in her yard.  She's trying to get along on a bumpy shit yard with her walker as the poor got junk people  have to follow her at a snail's pace so she could dictate what gets thrown away or not. 
[00:42:00]  And by the way, she didn't agree to throw away shit.  She lived in a trailer because her house was filled up.  The trailer she lived in was disgusting.  Do you think she has bugs?  It was worse than bugs.  She has chickens in the house?  Chickens in the house that were like, their feathers were falling off.  They were bleeding from the...  That's cute.  Their cages, by the way, were so full of shit that they were squished between the shit 
[00:42:30]  and the top of the cage.  They were squished between the shit and the top of the cage.  They had to lower their little chicken heads.  That's got to be criminal.  They've got to get a sheriff.  It is.  Did they haul her away?  That's got to be criminal.  At the end, they did put up a graphic that she had been charged with animal cruelty.  Did they take the animals?  They took some of them.  But the animal people that they had were out-of-state animal people that I guess the hoarder's show  had gotten.  But animal control showed up at one point, and I think hoarders put the kibosh on them 
[00:43:00]  and said, like, well, come back next week.  Look, we're shooting a show.  I don't care what you do to her next week.  Right.  Fucking just haul her in.  But, you know, we've got to get a show out of this.  We show the chickens, you know.  And there was this one goat, and it's just limping.  Not even limping.  It wasn't putting one leg on the ground.  And they said, how long has the goat been injured like that?  And she goes, about four months.  Fuck.  And is it pregnant?  Yep, yep, it's pregnant. 
[00:43:30]  It's going to have babies.  Poor Billy.  Yeah, a little Billy goat.  Well, it was a girl goat.  B-I-L-L-I-E.  Yeah, everyone knows that.  What do I know?  All right, we're getting clips of this show.  I can't wait to hear this.  I wanted to fucking just...  Was there a mason jar in this episode?  Ugh!  Thank you, Todd, in Kansas City.  Don't have time to go to you.  At one point, she sits down, and she's just doing that fat bitch sit down where her legs are spread  because that bubble of unimaginable whatever-the-fuck-it-is fat is hanging over her vagina. 
[00:44:00]  So she can't sit like a human being with your knees together.  They fly out like Humpty Dumpty.  Jesus.  And then she's drinking this brown liquid that looked like diarrhea.  It looked like she was drinking diarrhea out of a mason jar.  It was utterly disgusting.  Wow.  Worst hoard as I ever saw.  Dr. Ian Smith. 
[00:44:30]  But we don't know what it was?  What's that?  No, no, they never said what it was.  But she's drinking it, and you could see, like, there were...  They didn't watch it.  It was this brownish liquid.  Maybe it was just coffee.  Meh, meh, meh, meh.  It had, like, chunks in it.  I don't know what it was.  And it's this mason jar.  And she's just disgusting.  She had a mustache.  She had that big chunk of fat.  I wanted to reach in the TV, grab her under-chin fat, and tear it off.  Ugh.  Did she have little, like, chin hairs?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Like, those gray chin hairs?  And just yelling at people right into their face with their four teeth?  Fuck.  I was angry watching this.  All right.  Well, we're going to get clips of that.  Get clips of that.  And then during the show, they were showing Trucker Dan has a call about it.  Beyond Scared Straight.  It's the new Scared Straight that they're doing.  Remember Scared Straight?  They took the kids to the Broadway.  I love that.  Yes, I do.  I have it at home.  Yeah?  The original.  The original.  Yes!  Oh, Jimmy. 
[00:45:30]  They took the kids to Rawway Prison and scared them.  They were, you know, they were on the fence, kids, that might have gotten into some trouble.  And they put them in prison and let the prisoners yell at them, and they cry, and then they went  home and said, I never want to be here.  Didn't they do an update on those guys, Jimmy?  Yes.  And most of them stayed on the straight and narrow?  All but one.  One guy went to jail for, like, ten years.  And one of the guys, one of the convicts got out and then got sent back for something, like,  and then he was in jail with his own son. 
[00:46:00]  Your son.  Wow.  They take these kids now, guys and girls, put them in these prisons, and they get yelled  at by, it's inconceivable what these people are.  I didn't even know if this one thing was a woman, a man.  And apparently it was a woman, yelling at these young girls.  There was this one girl, they go, and there's people in the yard, and they go, come on out,  brother, come on out. 
[00:46:30]  And the guy's going, I'm going to open this door now, and you're going to walk out there.  And these kids were all, like, scared.  Holy shit.  And the one girl that was at the front of the line was so hot, so incredibly hot.  You wanted to say that, didn't you?  All I was looking at was, like, oh, she is just going to be raped with 8,000 things around  this prison.  And they made them wipe their makeup off.  Get that makeup off your face.  Get it off your face.  And they pin them against the wall, kind of, and yell at their face. 
[00:47:00]  But it's kind of like, you know they can't be touched.  They can't do anything.  You know they can't do anything.  Take this to another country and let the prisoners, you know.  Yeah, really fuck with them.  Because there was one woman, and she's saying what her name is, and it's something like,  you know, kill or murder, fucking death, whatever the fuck it is.  Satan, Beelzebub, they were calling her, whatever.  And then she's like, what's my name?  And any smart-ass kid should have turned around and went, uh, two, three,  five, six, eight, oh, two? 
[00:47:30]  It's like, no, motherfucker.  I know you can't touch me, so blow me.  Because what they do is they get the prisoners that have hope that they're getting out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So that's why they don't touch the kids.  That's their act.  You get a guy in there for life, or the death row guys, they're going to fucking fuck your  rules.  I'm going to slap some of these kids around.  Yeah, yeah.  Literally smack them in the face.  But that's the deal.  They both have.  You touch one of these kids, you're fucked.  Yeah.  And then, not only are they fucked, but let's say you have a life sentence, and you don't 
[00:48:00]  give a shit, and you just reach over and belt one of these kids in the face, you know,  what does the prisoner care?  But the prison itself cares, because, you know the lawsuit?  Oh, yeah.  They would get in for fucking a prisoner clocking a kid in the face?  See, the original one, you were convinced that these convicts would hit these kids at  any second.  Was the guy with one eye?  Remember the guy with one eye?  His name was Ali, yeah, he's out of jail now.  Is he?  Yeah, he was a problem.  He was a tough little fucking dude, man. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Because he was small.  But the thinking was, like, by the time they pull me off of you, I'll have hurt you.  And it's like, they can't give me any more time.  That was what these kids are thinking.  These guys are doing 25 to life.  Yeah, yeah.  35 years, double life.  That's the whole fear factor in it.  What are they going to do to them?  Look, they can't give me any more time.  That's what I'm saying.  But I'm sure the new version, it's safer, because the criminals...  Kids are tougher now, man.  They're not as scared of that shit.  You would never scare kids into that shit.  They're more savvy, yeah, they're more savvy now. 
[00:49:00]  They, I think they absolutely took kids that probably did a few little bad things, nothing  too bad, and they interviewed them and made sure they would be scared.  They're not getting these gangbangers that would be like, you know, whatever, motherfucker.  Go fuck your mama, you know?  Because they live with that.  Yeah, yeah.  There was one guy, though, in 10 years later, there was one guy, they had, like, the scared  straight update, where they showed that the modern day kids, and I guess this is 10, 
[00:49:30]  12 years ago now, but one of the newer convicts screaming, he had, like, missing teeth, and  you could see that he was a frightening guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was a frightening, because he was, like, spitting on them as he talked to them,  and he was a problem.  And even the tough fucking kids knew that this guy would probably bite your face.  There's new, uh, new scared straight, there's no new scared straight.  It doesn't work for everyone.  I got scared the other way.  Scared gay. 
[00:50:00]  There should be, like, a trailer, because last night they played an extended trailer,  uh, and, and there's some yelling going on, so that might be fun.  Yeah, I'm gonna check this out.  What channels are there?  I'll watch it.  It's the same as, uh, Hoarders and, um, Intervention.  Beautiful.  A&E?  All those great shows.  Yeah, A&E.  I think, right?  A&E is the go-to fucking channel.  A&E, uh.  They got some good shit.  All these channels are just changing into other things.  Yep.  Arts and entertainment.  I don't think there's any arts going on there. 
[00:50:30]  Nah.  It's, uh, do we got a, do we got a piece of a trailer?  I think so.  All right, here we go.  Yeah.  All it takes is one mistake.  Drug dealing.  Prison out of murder.  Stealing.  These kids got one foot in the door.  We allow kids to see what prison life is like.  You are now in the belly of the bigs.  We're gonna keep you out of prison.  Swing.  I'll fold you like a piece of paper.  In prison, no one cares about you.  Beyond Scared Straight. 
[00:51:00]  The series premiered.  Jesus.  The first day, January 13th.  That stinks.  What was it?  Fold you like a piece of paper.  That's terrible.  But was that a guy or a girl?  Or a chick?  It was a chick?  A girl.  Yeah.  Is there a new...  Because there was a longer clip that they played for the first time.  There's a great moment in the first one where everybody has to take their shoes off.  Oh, right.  And the one guy makes them.  And he's like, you know, I've taken your shoes.  What are you gonna do about it?  So the little guy with one eye comes in. 
[00:51:30]  And this one guy had a dumb look on his face.  Like he always looked like he was smiling, but he wasn't.  He was just nervous.  Five and pile.  So there's two guys.  He goes, there's two guys I don't like.  You and you.  And he's like, show me your shoes.  So they showed his shoes.  And he picked them up and he threw them.  And he goes, go home barefooted, you faggot.  They said that in the original?  It was all profanity.  No, I know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know that we can't use faggot anymore.  But that was one of that word, too.  You could curse on TV.  That was one of the first shows that I was like.  Because it was on regular TV.  And there was cursing. 
[00:52:00]  So it was very provocative.  Go home barefooted, you faggot.  That guy was the greatest.  I'm sure they're not saying that in the new version.  I don't know, man.  But they want it to be effective.  They might leave the language in.  We'll see.  Like, I would be very good at that.  I would say to the kids, like, do you really want to come here and have rough pillows and  small blankets?  Not quite getting the point across.  Yeah.  I'd be bad at it.  It's blankets.  Yeah.  Do you know that you have to stand online to get everything from the commissary? 
[00:52:30]  I would do a terrible job.  I'd be like, hmm, I don't know.  It doesn't sound that bad.  Let's take a break so we can eat.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We'll get, hopefully, more audio from that show.  When we come back, I have some more scared straight tips.  Oh, good, Jimmy.  Because I went through scared straight when I was in high school.  No, you really didn't.  When I was a freshman, I went through it.  You had the scared straight key.  Yeah, I was, they called me the federal prison kid. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, but I had some, and I talked tough to the guys.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I didn't see those clips on the show.  Yeah, they cut it.  It made them all look bad.  Brett Favre in more trouble.  A lot of people know by now, but we'll give you the story next.  Yes.  It's getting tougher and tougher to support this guy, I'll be honest.  It's getting easier and easier for me to support him.  We'll explain.  And a lot of people might have got hepatitis in Massapequa.  Why?  Wait till you find out why.  Oh.  Or how they might have got their hepatitis. 
[00:53:30]  And lots of other things.  Stay there.  Yeah, when you call my name.  Shout a bit at the Pavlov's door.  Yeah, when you lay me out.  The heart of feeling like I've got a big band from my brother.  Fuck yeah.  Timeless, right?  Timeless.  Maybe not, though. 
[00:54:00]  Who knows?  Do the kids enjoy that riff?  I don't mind it.  Do you like the Rolling Stones?  I'm not a big Stones fan.  Oh, my God.  I don't like most of their songs, but there are a few I kind of like.  I like this one.  70s, Rolling Stones, forget about it.  Forget about it.  And they snuck into the 80s with a couple good ones, but that's about it.  But the 70s and the Stones, my God.  Huge.  Good God.  Brett Favarar. 
[00:54:30]  Brett Favri.  Jets sued by two former massage therapists.  Now, who are these loud mouths that are all of a sudden coming out?  Yeah.  Because they see somebody else capitalizing.  Yeah, Brett's been gone a while from the Jets organization, right?  Spent a couple years at this point, I think.  Yeah, but they smell money.  Brett Favre is getting sued for sending pervy text messages and not by Jen Sturger.  She was the original Brut.  Send his cock? 
[00:55:00]  Did he send his cock?  Speaking of that situation with Jen Sturger, the website that broke that news was Deadspin,  and we got the editor-in-chief coming in today, AJ.  Oh.  Deadspin's a very good sports site there.  Editor-in-chief.  Second only to TedWilliams.com.  Our own Puddle of AIDS does a fine, fine sports blog.  What?  Head.  Ted Williams Head.  Sorry, yeah.  Yes, Ted Williams.  Ted Williams.  Yeah, TedWilliamsHead.com.  Of course it's his head.  I'm thinking TedWilliams.com is probably something a little different.  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, TedWilliamsHead.com is a great place to go for some sports shit.  And, uh...  It's frozen, you know.  What happened?  It's frozen.  What happened?  It's frozen.  You think it's still frozen?  Of course it is.  Let's buy that.  It's frozen in his head.  Let's buy it.  Just have it in a case in the middle of this fucking console.  That would be great.  But I hear it's rotting.  Of course it is.  They would say it's rotting and...  Yeah.  Well, how are you going to put that on a nice body someday?  I don't know what their plan is.  Got a nice body with a rotting head. 
[00:56:00]  With that cryogenic freezing bullshit.  They're doing some freaky shit.  Did you hear about the twin that was born 11 years later?  Or the triplet?  That is odd.  Did you see that story over, Brick?  That fucking egg or the frozen embryo?  Was it the third of a triplet or it was a twin?  I forget now.  But 11 years later, they finally gave birth to the twin's kid.  Yeah.  Or the triplet's kid.  It's strange.  Very strange.  They have a triplet and one of them is... 
[00:56:30]  11 years.  11 years younger.  Older or younger.  Amazing.  All right.  Brett Favre.  So you've got the two former massage therapists now suing over pervy text messages.  Two former massage therapists for the Jets filed suit against the grid.  Great and gangrene.  Today, charging they were fired after they spurned the quarterback's crude digital advances.  Ah.  And papers filed the Manhattan Supreme Court.  Christina Scavo and Shannon O'Toole says Favre made his move on them in the summer of 2008 
[00:57:00]  after the pair had been working at the Jets training camp on Long Island.  Ah.  Here's one of the text messages.  Brett here.  The text to O'Toole began.  You and Chris, you want to get together?  I'm all alone.  Ah.  Jesus.  Come on, man.  He's a fucking rookie, man.  What are you doing?  He then sent a follow-up text saying,  Kind of lonely tonight.  I guess I have bad intentions.  Here's my cock.  Look at the helmet.  It's silly, isn't it? 
[00:57:30]  Now I know why he had a shitty year with the Jets.  He's thinking about everything else but football.  Scavo told her husband about the text, and he called the Packers legend and requested  that he stop soliciting his wife for bad intentions.  Yeah, knock it off.  Or to get together with her.  Mr. Scavo further requested that Favre apologize for his inappropriate behavior of sexually harassing  Christina Scavo and other massage therapists, the suit says.  Favre responded in an inappropriate manner and refused to apologize. 
[00:58:00]  He essentially told him to go away, and as a celebrity, he couldn't be bothered with the little people.  The little people.  I don't think that's true.  No, I don't think he said that.  Who said the little people?  Did he say, if you can't afford bread, eat cake?  Fucking.  If you can't afford bread, eat cake.  Is that the quote?  Yeah, if they can't afford bread, let them eat cake.  Marie Antoinette said that. 
[00:58:30]  But cake is more expensive.  Beauty, that was exactly why she was a cunt, and they cut her head off.  Yeah, she wasn't being genuine.  She was being a cunt.  Oh, I gotcha.  I'm sorry.  Jesus.  She wasn't being helpful.  Okay.  If they can't afford bread, let them eat cake.  He said it was his clients who got sacked after the hubby's phone call.  This is the lawyer talking.  Scavo and O'Toole were never again called to provide massage therapy for the Jets.  We're obviously not good at it.  If you don't have shame leaking over your knuckles, you have no business massaging anyone. 
[00:59:00]  That's called shame.  Go massage an old lady's feet in a fucking shoe store.  Fucking goody gumdrops.  Beat it, narc.  The problem I have here is this is two years old, so it looks like they're capitalizing on some shit.  Of course they are.  Why didn't they bring this up when it happened?  Yeah.  Summer of 2008, so it's almost two and a half years at this point.  They see the shit happening.  They see money's in the air.  Somebody else is making some cake off of Jeff Farvin' his wacky-looking schlong. 
[00:59:30]  What does Brett's wife think of this whole thing?  Is she just standing by her man?  Maybe they have some kind of open relationship.  What's going on?  She's probably happy she's not the only one who has to touch his awful fucking umbrella in the drink cockhead.  Stupid, flattened dickhead.  That is really just an odd-looking dick.  It's fucking horrendous.  He probably jerks off really hard under a desk, so he's always mushing the helmet. 
[01:00:00]  He despises his penis.  It's just silly.  People mad that we didn't play the Ted Williams clip after we mentioned Ted Williams.  The famous Ted Williams clip.  We got way too much shit.  I can't find anything anymore.  I can't find anything.  I really can't.  There's too many clips to play these days. 
[01:00:30]  I just stick to the basics.  That's what I try to do.  I got it.  Look at this.  Oh.  All right.  It's a little, the time he's a little off, but.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Damn.  Freeze his head.  And that is a clip talking about Ted Williams and his head.  His frozen head somewhere in Arizona.  Yes.  Why, again, Arizona?  You'd think they'd put that in Fargo, where it's freezing just in case the power goes out. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  All of a sudden, it's 120 degrees in here.  Holy shit.  All of a sudden, some asshole forgot to turn the AC on.  Yeah, yeah.  No one's looking, so he turns it on and make believe it wasn't 98 degrees all night.  Give you a little extra time.  Right.  Get his head.  He could put it out in the snow.  Right.  Just put all these heads out in the snow like beer cans when the electricity goes off in  your house.  It's like, well, we could always put the beer in the snow.  You're going to trust some asshole that's making $7 an hour to keep your dead fucking 
[01:01:30]  head frozen?  Relative's head.  Until they figure out what to do with it in the future?  Fuck that.  The future.  The future.  So what do we got on Brett Favre?  I guess that's not, there's not much there, right?  No.  I think he's retired and he wants to get jerked off a lot.  I respect that.  He's texting.  People pissed off at me because I'm not convinced that he's retired.  I don't think he's done.  People really fucking mad at me on Twitter. 
[01:02:00]  I'm telling you.  He's done.  He's done.  I think he decides, okay, I could be a mentor for a quarterback out there.  Yeah, I'll do that role.  No, he knows he's done.  He could be a mentor for me.  I'm holding to my thought that there's a slight possibility.  I think the door is open just slightly.  The only thing I'll do is his zipper.  That rotten little flat dickhead is poking out.  His fucking awful mushroom cock.  He should have a frog sitting on his cock.  Yelling ribbit. 
[01:02:30]  Licking his bag.  Really is not.  That sucks.  Horrible presentation.  He has Smurfs living under his cockhead.  His cockhead is dumb.  He's a lunky cockhead and I hate it.  I have to flick it with my finger.  Suck.  Angrily.  Well.  Fuck, man.  I want to flick it like it's a fat kid's ear.  Like just the underside where it's really soft and tender. 
[01:03:00]  With your head.  The juicy underside of a cock.  It looks like a picture of a cock that's been scaled down in Photoshop only on the Y axis.  Y axis.  Come on.  I don't know what that means.  It's a Photoshop joke.  I don't know what that means.  It's too smart for me.  It squishes everything.  Oh.  I didn't say it like that.  I don't know what Y axis means.  You guys want to deal with...  I like the word squishy.  It's squishy.  You guys want to deal with Alex Jones today because he thinks the government is killing 
[01:03:30]  all the birds in Arkansas.  That's stupid.  I hope he's right.  I think I don't want to like...  I think that's what I'm hearing.  I hope he's right.  They said the birds died of massive trauma.  Blunt trauma.  Blunt.  Bird fight.  Forced trauma.  Yeah.  There's some unruly other birds.  Crows.  That were...  Crows.  The crows got them.  Yeah.  They're saying they don't know though if the injuries were sustained when they hit the  ground.  Well, that would be blunt fucking trauma.  Yeah.  Or...  Falling out of the sky.  They could have just... 
[01:04:00]  You know, in the air, perhaps they were just stunned.  They stunned.  He's just pointed.  He's pointed.  My brother talked to me after the show.  He's saying swamp gas.  Swamp gas?  That just happens.  It fucking builds up and releases and fucking...  That gas shit is very toxic to birds.  Well, maybe.  A little methane.  He said that happens a lot where all of a sudden the fucking swamps have to release  their gas.  And the thing is...  You got a flock of birds flying over at that moment. 
[01:04:30]  The gas will kill them.  They don't like that gas shit.  How can they tell if the birds suffered the injury?  They're falling 8,000 feet.  They can't feel it.  We're getting socked in the mouth behind a bar.  But they did say the birds' organs were all fine, which would lead you to believe that  it wasn't any kind of poison.  Ah.  Ah.  So then we can't say swamp gas anymore.  They are saying blunt force trauma, which would be either they hit something in midair, but  there's a lot of birds to have hit something, or... 
[01:05:00]  Maybe a UFO.  Something happened, and then they fell, and hit the ground.  I like your lightning strike theory.  Lightning, a little lightning.  I really do.  I like the lightning strike theory.  Would that kill all of them, though?  Well, it could have phased them enough where they just fell out of the air and hit the ground  and died.  Right.  They didn't have time to fucking get their shit back together.  Hello, Polly!  But aren't they not grounded, so they're...  Have you ever seen the parrot sketch?  Let me see this one.  This is classic. 
[01:05:30]  Now, that's what I call a dead parrot.  Oh, no, they're stunned.  Look, my lad, I've had just about enough of this.  That parrot is definitely deceased.  And when I bought it not half an hour ago, you assured me that its lack of movement was  due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squawk.  Oh, sir, it's got to be pining for the fjords.  Pining for the fjords?  What kind of talk is that?  Look, where did it fall flat in its back the moment I got it home? 
[01:06:00]  The Norwegian blue prefers kipping on its back.  It's a beautiful bird, lovely plume.  Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot, and I discovered that the only reason  that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed  there.  Of course it was nailed there, otherwise it was muzzled up to those bars, and boom!  Look, matey.  We're watching TV.  That's a great sketch, though.  This bird wouldn't voomp if you put 50,000 volts through it. 
[01:06:30]  Fucking Marty Python.  See, then he goes, ain't a bird sleeping or something, right?  I don't like this one, though.  No?  Nah, I thought there should have been farts in it.  The bird should have farted or something.  That would have been funny.  Yeah, hey, the bird's farting over here.  Get out of here.  It's stinking the whole room up with clouds.  Like, I would laugh at that. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, this should be thrown into the bird thing.  Randy in Missouri.  Randy.  Well, you know, you was talking about how the birds all were killed at one time.  Yes, we were.  This time of year, the birds are all flocked up.  You might have a million birds in one big flock down here.  Yeah, I was watching a lot of footage yesterday.  They say that there's so many fucking birds this time of year in that area that you look  up and the sky is black.  There's just millions of these fucking things. 
[01:07:30]  And what do they do?  So 4,000 of these falling out of the sky, you know, is a very small percentage of the  considering the amount of birds in the air.  Or maybe, sir, it's a new Ben Stiller movie, Meet the Flockers.  Have a good day, guys.  Wow, that was bad.  Not as bad as that fucking horse shit of a movie.  That is still doing well at the box office.  I like the way they look at each other in the poster.  It's like, ah. 
[01:08:00]  We're both watching each other now.  Things have changed here.  Have they?  Same joke.  But then what about the fish?  You got the dead fish, too.  Ah, fucking birds and fish die.  But the fish are a little further away.  They say that was disease or something.  Lack of oxygen sometimes?  Too many fish in one area?  Yeah, something too many fish in the pond.  That used to happen at Mill Dam Pond.  Yeah, they'd run out of oxygen in the water. 
[01:08:30]  Do you remember that when we were growing up every once in a while?  Oh, yeah.  Mill Dam Pond in the Centiport area.  All these fucking fish would come in, and then the tide would go out, and they couldn't  get out fast enough or something.  Smell like dirty vaginas.  Oh, my God, dude.  Bunch of dopey fish breathing each other's air.  Stupid mouths.  And the dumb gills.  Yeah.  That fucking rocks.  Dude skis down Park Avenue during the blizzard.  That fucking rocks.  He's kitchen.  Let's see him do it in August.  That would be very impressive. 
[01:09:00]  He's on skis.  He's got a rope tied to the back of a bumper, and he's fucking skiing.  Oh, how great would a dump truck look fucking...  Oh, I love that.  Or a plow with its fucking thing raised.  It just gets nailed fucking plow first.  We used to do that when I used to be a private sanitation collector, and we used to do that  shit all the time.  No skis or anything.  We would just use our shitty work boots.  But did you hold on to the bumper?  Yeah, we used to do that growing up.  We would hold on to the lip of the garbage truck as it would go from stop to stop.  How bad does a garbage truck smell when you're like...  You get used to it really quickly.  Do you really?  It's not as bad as you think. 
[01:09:30]  Did you see a lot of rats and roaches and stuff?  Yeah, we actually knew the paths that the rats would take from certain stops where there  were a lot of rats.  So when we had a helper on the truck, we could set somebody up on an X, on a dime, and be  like, just stand right there.  And then we'd just punch and smack the bags, and all the rats would run across the guy's  feet, and it would work every time.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was really disgusting.  Rats follow a certain fucking track.  That's why they're so goddamn hard to get.  Yeah, like their scent or their oils or something like that.  Yeah, man.  I read a whole book on rats. 
[01:10:00]  It was really disgusting.  They're fucking creepy.  But how do you...  When you're throwing bags away, don't you see rats in the truck?  There has to be some of them.  Not so much.  You don't really...  I mean, I'm sure there's rats in the bags that we've thrown away, but I've never seen  one crawl out and jump out of the hopper or anything.  How about roaches?  Roaches, I don't remember seeing.  I mean, you have to understand, too, when our shift would start, it was nighttime.  We would do for like 8 p.m. until the sun came up, so I'm sure there was tons  of that shit.  I didn't really see a lot.  Did you ever have garbage juice explode on you?  I never did.  A friend of mine, because the bag's like, you know, you're compressing all that garbage  and there's a lot of air pressure in there and it makes a lot of weird sounds sometimes. 
[01:10:30]  So a friend of mine, he was running the hopper and one of the bags, well, a lot of the bags,  started making this weird whistle.  Like, eeeh!  And my friend just went, eeeh!  And like went, eeeh!  And pursed his lips up.  And right as he went, eeeh!  Juice from the garbage truck just shot a perfect scream into his mouth.  It was fantastic.  Was he disgusted?  Oh, of course.  He was dry heaving everywhere.  It was the best thing I've ever seen.  Oh, God damn.  Fucking great.  So you want Alex Jones?  Because this is a conspiracy thing happening with the birds. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's actually...  Can we make a rule that he only gets 10 minutes?  Yeah.  Roland, if Alex Jones is around, tell him we'll give him 10 minutes to explain why the birds  fell out of the sky in Arkansas.  And the dead fish.  100,000 dead fish, right?  And Troy will be jerking off in the other room as he speaks.  Well, Troy has questions.  He questions things.  I question things.  The problem is he has no fucking info to back anything up. 
[01:11:30]  But he questions things.  He doesn't like to research, but he does like to question.  You want to see what he's up to with the birds?  I just think it's interesting.  I just think it's interesting.  Well, he's had a whole day to do more research.  Troy, where are you?  Well, why?  Are you making fun of me?  Because I question things?  Because I question...  But now he's had a whole day.  Yeah.  Because yesterday we did question him back and he had nothing as far as...  And there's been a lot of info on these birds over the past 24 hours.  He just says chemtrails.  And we're like, what do you mean by that?  He has no idea.  Chemtrails.  You know, I'm just saying, I just said...  Troy.  Ah. 
[01:12:00]  Your music is playing.  Yes, it is the mysterious Troy.  Hi, Troy.  Hello.  Now, you've had 24 hours.  Yeah.  And you said the birds died because of chemtrails.  But I'm thinking you might have done a little more research.  Well, I was in Arkansas, like I said.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  And I had never seen in my life that many trails in the sky.  I grew up in Pennsylvania.  Middle of fucking nowhere.  Okay.  I've never seen...  That has nothing to do with Arkansas.  Hold on.  I'm getting to it.  Oh.  Well, just hang on.  I'm going to explain to you why I was saying what I was saying. 
[01:12:30]  Sure.  Yes.  Yes.  Ooh.  So, I grew up in middle of nowhere Pennsylvania.  I'd never seen that many chemtrails.  I had noticed them when I was driving through Arkansas.  I was like, wow.  There's a lot.  What the fuck is going on here?  Um, and then I had just put something up on my Twitter about it, making a joke about  them spraying the hillbillies with, with, what are they spraying on them?  And then a couple days later in Arkansas, birds are falling out of the sky.  So, it was just, I, I'm not a scientist. 
[01:13:00]  It was just something that, it was an observation.  Wait a minute, back up.  What do you mean you're not a scientist?  What are you doing here?  Wow.  We all thought you were a scientist.  We're very confused.  God, Jim.  Neutron Troy.  Go ahead, Troy.  So, I had just made an observation.  That's all.  What's wrong with my shoes, Jim?  Nothing.  If you're Henry Fonda. 
[01:13:30]  Henry Fonda.  It's an ungolden pump.  Let me see your shoes.  That's right.  Great shoes.  The big blueberries.  What's wrong?  He's got hipster sneaks on them.  They're Vans.  They're skate sneakers.  Yeah.  He's a hipster.  Oh, he should.  He's hip.  Troy knows what kind of sneakers to buy.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  So, I mean, that was the only point.  That was the only point.  And what they're saying.  No, but we already, like, debunked that, sort of, because then it was all over yesterday.  So, I'm saying you had 24 hours to maybe, you know, pump up your side of this argument.  Well, whatever you want to say about it, whatever caused it, whatever caused that to happen, 
[01:14:00]  they are still putting aluminum in our atmosphere, regardless of the birds or not.  So, well, thank you, then.  Didn't we want aluminum in the atmosphere?  Is that bad?  Did we?  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Well, it leads to a lot of different diseases.  Like what?  They're finding it in rainwater.  So, we're drinking what they're putting in the atmosphere to supposedly combat global warming. 
[01:14:30]  So, where are the people getting their water so they don't get, you know, affected by the aluminum?  I don't know.  Maybe they have water purifiers.  How are they doing this for global warming when they're still debating global warming?  Well, how is this financed, first of all?  Because a lot of this global warming financing isn't going through because people, a lot of people don't believe it's really an issue.  Well, regardless if it is or not, they're still debating the facts.  So, how do they get to the point where they're spraying barium and aluminum particles in the atmosphere and who's paying for it? 
[01:15:00]  Exactly.  I don't know.  I don't know who's doing it.  No, Troy.  You're our conspiracy guy.  Yeah.  I'm not.  Hey, listen.  You've got to do more research.  I might have just uncovered some secret documents.  All right.  Good.  Give us some secret documents.  We're just like Alex Jones.  Well, I do my digging, and unlike Troy, I do my research.  You've been researching.  And it says here, because I always trust, when I needed to know an answer and I need to be 100% sure that it's accurate and proper, I go to Yahoo Answers. 
[01:15:30]  And it says here that the military is putting aluminum particles in the atmosphere to make the harp weapon more conductive.  Ah, the harp weapon.  That's what it is?  I did a show on that one during the first season of Conspiracy Theory.  I'm a Navy SEAL.  A fighter.  Maybe they just want to keep the earth hot inside. 
[01:16:00]  Maybe.  Maybe that's what it is.  A governor.  Well, Troy, why don't you tell the boys about the...  He's shiny.  Why don't you tell the boys about the rainstorms in the desert?  I don't know.  You think it's the British filter people?  Trying to pump up business?  You know they made rain showers in the desert.  Where's that?  Abu Dhabi?  Abu Dhabi?  You know about the rain showers.  Abu Dhabi?  Troy, you know about that? 
[01:16:30]  No, I don't.  Joe Rogan was tweeting about it, too.  They decided to make it rain in the desert.  That's a good thing.  If we can control weather, that's a sign of progress.  What's wrong with controlling weather?  Where's that article?  So we got the info out there correctly.  They're making it rain in the desert.  Make it rain?  Some scientists.  The candidates have done that.  It's great.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  So they made it rain in...  What about this, man?  In Abu Dhabi. 
[01:17:00]  No, not forest rain.  Oh, what is it?  Desert?  Sorry.  A desert.  I think it was Abu Dhabi.  Yeah, Abu Dhabi.  UPI.com.  Can you read that for me, somebody?  I can't...  I can't...  Scientists working for the ruler of Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates say they've used  weather technology to create rain in the desert.  Jesus Christ.  How do they do that?  Most of the artificially created storms were at the height of the summer.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm trying to figure out how to do this.  They've been using...  They just invented a really big hose and fucking... 
[01:17:30]  No, it's just a giant ionizer's metal antenna on steel poles to generate fields of negatively  charged particles.  The particles attract tiny specks of dust ever present in the atmosphere in desert regions  and are carried up from the particle emitter by rising air over the hot desert.  Once the dust particles reach the right height for cloud formation, the charged particles  attract water molecules...  I was just saying this.  ...and start to condense around them.  Holy shit, is that cool?  Yeah.  Are you buying it in?  I don't know.  It's being reported by Britain's Daily Mail. 
[01:18:00]  Well, that's a good source.  Which is the most lying-est-ass newspaper I've ever fucking read.  It's a good source.  They made it rain in Abu Dhabi.  It was very...  Also, Time is reporting it also.  Time Magazine?  But are they reporting it as this really happened, or are they reporting that it's being reported?  Scientists create 52 artificial rainstorms in Abu Dhabi Desert.  Oh.  It's easy to do in Abu Dhabi.  Good for them, then.  Hail, lightning, what?  Yeah.  Hey, good for them. 
[01:18:30]  Fuck them.  Good.  Good.  All right, we got Alex Jones.  With my weather machine, I'll rule the world.  I'll rule the world.  Neutron Troy, if you want to stay in the studio, you're more than welcome.  Yes, please.  Let's say hi to Alex Jones.  Alex, we're very concerned.  Birds falling from the skies in Arkansas, sir.  Gentlemen, it is good to be with you, but saying that I just was woken out of bed about  30 seconds ago, let me go to the landline here.  Okay.  Ah.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, we got you, Alex. 
[01:19:00]  Alex, you're being brought into this story.  Some of your theories and thoughts on this.  What are they, by the way?  Why don't we let the audience know?  Uh, dealing with the birds?  Yes, the birds.  The birds.  Well, it is very suspicious.  Hmm.  You guys are going to get a good interview from me when I'm one minute up here.  You want to, we can call you back.  We could, we could do one of those dumb commercial breaks and let you get your head together. 
[01:19:30]  No, it's, you know, it's kind of like a toaster oven.  It's starting to glow.  You can see the little, you know, little, little breadcrumbs burning.  He's starting to get his mind together.  What were you dreaming about when that phone went off?  I was dreaming about the bomb going off in my head when the phone rang.  Oh, all that, uh, I bet it's all conspiracy stuff that he dreams about.  How does he even sleep?  I don't know how he sleeps.  How do you sleep?  All that stuff.  Knowing as much as you know. 
[01:20:00]  With the heart project.  How do you sleep, Alex?  Alex.  I'm going to harp.  That's who I was dreaming of, exactly.  I was like.  It's like Alex takes a pill to go to sleep.  Maybe an ambient.  And the pill might not be completely warm.  We're all ambient.  Right.  So what do you think? 
[01:20:30]  What's with these birds?  Why are they falling out of the sky, in your opinion?  Well, maybe they were, uh, walleye fish or something.  Jesus.  You guys can't do that.  Now I'm going to do the whole interview with a Ventura voice.  Yeah.  Love that.  He wants to call you that.  Alex, did you know that they now admit that they have harp-like technologies that they are using in Abu Dhabi to make the desert rain? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, we were just talking about that one.  Is this true?  They're making it rain in the desert?  And is it a problem?  Okay, gentlemen.  Are you awake?  I'm almost ready for the interview.  I'm almost ready.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  What, are you firing up your computers?  Are you firing up Wikipedia and Google? 
[01:21:30]  I'm firing up Wikipedia and Google.  Exactly.  I didn't go to bed until like two, okay?  No.  We can call you back, Alex.  I was up working.  No, no, no.  Researching.  It's happening.  It's happening.  All right.  Danger, Will Robinson.  Danger.  A Navy SEAL is approaching from the Southwest.  I'm turning around.  It's not worth it.  My wife just got up.  She said, you're on the air right now.  You're acting like a fruitcake.  Oh, man. 
[01:22:00]  Yes, I'm on the air, honey.  I'm just screwing around with these guys a little bit.  No one in the room.  Because I'm a Navy SEAL.  Well, Alex, one of our boys, Troy Kwan, he's got questions.  I'm a fighter.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Troy.  What's going on with Troy Kwan?  He's one of your guys, man.  He's one of your disciples.  I want to know what happened with these birds.  Right.  Troy has questions.  He's thinking chemtrails or something.  Made the birds fall out of the sky in Arkansas.  Troy has so many questions, we want to get him a sports jacket with a lot of question marks on it. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Can we do that, Troy?  Would you wear that?  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'm going to answer the questions right now.  Hold on.  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, guys.  Good to be here with you this morning.  Thanks for having me on.  Oh, you want to start over?  We can do that.  Alex Jones, everyone.  Hello, gentlemen.  I don't think that's very funny, you guys making fun of Governor Ventura like that.  Yeah, I'm very disrespectful, and I apologize.  What do you think about these birds now falling out of the sky in Arkansas? 
[01:23:00]  Alex Jones.  Well, to be very serious, it's suspicious because first he said it was 1,000, then 2,000 birds, and 4,000.  Now it's 5,000.  And they've had the different state officials and people come out who have examined the winged creatures,  and they have said that their insides were pulverized, including their livers, and there wasn't any big boom. 
[01:23:30]  People didn't see some big storm.  None of the homes were damaged.  So it's very, very suspicious.  And if we have this big history of government testing, and in many other cases when government has done covert tests over cities,  chemicals, biologicals, or radiologicals, it will kill birds.  I mean, it's kind of like the canary in the coal mine that's affected first by it. 
[01:24:00]  And this ridiculous story that supposedly fireworks would do this, that some type of firecracker,  some type of aerial mortar fired by some group of drunken revelers would cause 5,000 birds to have pulverized insides.  It's very, very suspicious.  Now, Alex, let's say that this is some type of experiment being done by the government, the military maybe, 
[01:24:30]  and we don't know about it because obviously it would be secret at this point.  Is this a bad thing?  I don't know.  I mean, the government shot up all those kids in Guatemala with live syphilis.  Is it bad?  Those black people.  But they went to Guatemala, so who cares?  I mean, we can all agree it's Guatemala.  No, no, no, no.  I think we should trust the government. 
[01:25:00]  And, you know, when they took 4,500 foster children and radiated them to death, I mean, that sounds like a government that I want to get back to.  It was a different time.  It was a different time, Alex.  Well, exactly.  I mean, just like they admit that just a decade ago with Project Shad, they would put our troops out on ships and nerve gas them or nerve gas their own troops.  Or they'd have a young GI sign a form. 
[01:25:30]  The Brits did it as well.  Oh, you're going to get three days off for your country.  We're going to test the flu on you.  And they'd march him into a chamber and hit him with nerve gas and then call mommy up and say that little Billy died of the flu.  And then they dissected Billy's brain.  These are nice people.  I mean, like sodium fluoride in the water, they admitted more than doubles bone cancer in the general population, more than quadruples it in boys who drank it. 
[01:26:00]  I mean, they're doing this because they care about our teeth.  Yeah, but cavities are down.  They care about us a lot.  These are good people.  So what are their intentions if they aren't noble?  They are noble.  They're building a new world order for all of us.  They're doing a big, giant scientific experiment.  And the mere fact that this information is known and the public doesn't fight back is prima facie evidence of the elite that we're animals and need to all be exterminated. 
[01:26:30]  And so they're peacefully, quietly soft-killing us.  We're such animals we're not even aware of it because we're already dead.  But, Alex, don't...  Oh, it's so good.  Doesn't the government need...  But, Alex, doesn't the government need the people and the money from the people to keep this power base?  Isn't it odd to have a bunch of chiefs and no Indians?  What are you talking about here?  What would be the upside? 
[01:27:00]  Actually, the globalists are killing us because they love us.  But why would they kill the people that give them the power?  Well, it's because there's six and a half billion people and the globalists have written in literally, literally thousands of their own reports.  I mean, in the foreword to, if I was an animal by his royal highness, the Duke of Edinburgh.  That's Prince Philip. 
[01:27:30]  He's married to Queen Elizabeth.  All of these people openly explain why.  There's too many of us.  We're useless feeders.  This is their planet, their resources.  See, they've taken the planet over, and now they see us as like weevils or roaches that have gotten into the pantry and are eating their food.  So what's the criteria for being one of these people that get to be on the inside, the people that won't be killed?  There is no criteria. 
[01:28:00]  You're already being soft-killed.  The population's being phased out.  They're now bringing in a global one-child policy that Ted Turner just pushed for three weeks ago.  Is that bad, though?  I mean, really thinning the herd down.  Don't we have too many people?  Wouldn't it be a better planet with less people, regardless of how it happens?  Don't worry.  They're already thinning you out.  Not me.  The sperm count's dropped down by 87% in the Western world.  I'm going down fight now.  The replacement, well, I mean, there was just an issue in the January issue a year ago in 2010 in National Geographic magazine, 
[01:28:30]  and it described how Singapore is the perfect country and how they execute you for criticizing the government  and how they have the lowest population replacement rate in the world for every two adults.  They have 1.2 children, and how that's the world model.  And it's so beautiful.  And they have all these TV shows on Discovery Channel about life after people and how beautiful it's all. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, when the buildings crumble.  We're all being taught how great it is that we're all just kind of societally, in fact, that's what the article says,  slid our wrists and ease into a hot bath.  And we've all been taught that it's kind of smart to disdain our survival instinct,  to not look towards the stars and to hate ourselves and just say, we're all going to die soon.  So now, how do all these countries that can't agree on just trade and ideologies, 
[01:29:30]  how do they all get together to agree to do this to their populace?  Well, I mean, how did China in the 1970s sign on to the one-child policy?  They signed on to State Department Memorandum 200.  You can read it.  It was declassified in 92.  Yeah, I did already.  Written in the night.  You have read that?  Yeah, it was on a fortune cookie.  Good. 
[01:30:00]  It's a very big cookie.  Good.  I'm glad you read that.  That's good for you.  I didn't read it, but I did write a comedy around it.  Well, good.  Oh, exactly.  It was a musical act.  The one kid, you throw something in the water.  The compulsion they implant in the general public to giggle as they flutter towards the open flame.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  They're mothy and malty eyes, happily looking up at their incineration.  Alex, I'm not listening to you and saying, like, no, you're wrong. 
[01:30:30]  This is my whole new tack on this thing.  I am listening to you saying, yes, okay, I'll take your word for this,  but I am waiting to hear the upside of it.  How do the people benefit, the people that are left with all these corpses laying around in time,  how are the people that are left, how do they benefit from this depopulation of the planet? 
[01:31:00]  Well, I mean, that's a really good question.  I know.  Oh, Alex, I like that question.  All right, now, let me get serious and answer that question.  I know the show's a comedy, and I kind of play into that, and I apologize, everybody.  That's all right.  You kind of got me when I was a little dingy, as they say.  But the globalists see us as garbage. 
[01:31:30]  Garbage just doesn't, you know, not have value.  It has a negative value.  You have to pay people to carry it away.  And so, throughout history, human life has been cheap.  If we go back 2,200 years ago, the Romans, you know, were basically killing their slaves,  a hundred and a pop, every weekend for entertainment,  making them hack each other up with battle axes and swords,  and throwing them to cave bears and lions and tigers and all sorts of things like that. 
[01:32:00]  And so, life has always been cheap.  Now, because of robotics and nanotech and mechanization,  the globalists have openly written paper after paper,  one of them written by Bill Joy back in 99 for Wired Magazine.  He's the co-owner of Sun Microsystems,  and he talked about how he went to a meeting of 200 top computer companies, 
[01:32:30]  software engineers, owners, you know, billionaires.  And they openly discussed there at that meeting,  it's called Why the Future Doesn't Need Us,  would the elite go ahead and just wipe everybody out,  or would they just set up a world to entertain us,  but then wasn't that immoral because we would eat up all the resources  and hurt the precious planet.  And so, we have been marked as a plague, a scourge. 
[01:33:00]  But it sounds like what you're saying, then, is the criteria could be  that the people that pay taxes would be the people that fit in to this elite group,  and the scourge are the people that don't pay and don't pull their weight.  Yes, yes, that's one way to look at it.  That's how...  So, I'm safe, right?  No. 
[01:33:30]  I pay my taxes.  No, you particularly.  But I pay a lot of taxes.  I think I'm in the upper echelon.  No, no, you're seen, actually, as someone, as a slave here on the tax farm,  who is a little bit smarter than the others.  And so, the true eugenics program, you're the main one.  They're targeting, you know, I have the government manuals,  that if the young male raises their hand too much,  you know, engages in leadership type behavior of not just regurgitating information. 
[01:34:00]  But again, Alex...  Hold on, let me just...  All right, all right.  I'm just trying to say, though...  Let me just really answer your question, okay?  Yes, yes, please.  I'm trying to quantify this.  Listen, the globalists have said it in literally thousands of statements and publications.  This is official UN policy.  It's official...  You can pull up the video clips of Ted Turner saying that Prince Philip,  Jacques Cousteau, before he died,  that this is all they talk about, the Georgia Guidestones. 
[01:34:30]  They want the world population at 500 million instead of 6.5 billion.  And what they openly say is that they want to orderly reduce the world population  through one-child policies, through cancer viruses and the vaccines and other things,  and through sterilants.  They want to reduce the world population finally in phases down to 500 million.  And then those 500 million will be given the life extension technologies that are being developed. 
[01:35:00]  They will be allowed to go to space.  They will be allowed to be like the gods on Mount Olympus.  But they are not going to allow the profane, as they call us, the unascended ones.  It's all that's in the Luciferianism, to go forward, you know, just like in 2001, a space odyssey.  And, of course, Arthur C. Clarke admitted all this, the inventor of the communications satellite and so much more,  that it's all basically a metaphor for how they're working. 
[01:35:30]  You know, you've got the two supermen on board the spacecraft that have already been separated from humanity.  Now they've got to, at the final point, defeat the computer.  The computer wants to be able to, you know, interface with the aliens.  The computer's been given the message.  The men haven't been given the message yet.  And they're going out into deep space.  And then the computer kills one of them.  The other human, the ascended one, defeats it, gets into the pod, goes to the other dimension,  warps through, and is reincarnated as the superhuman and sent back to Earth. 
[01:36:00]  So, wait, in the final plan, there are 500 million people in on this secret?  No.  The globalists, look, look, I mean, you know the guy that wrote the original James Bond movies was OSS and then MI6.  Well, you're Fleming.  And so many of his books that he wrote got turned into movies.  And, again, they stylized them.  They packaged them. 
[01:36:30]  They did a few things like that.  And you notice that one of the books he wrote was Moonraker.  It had a different name.  Of course, we see it now, a movie from 1970, whatever.  It looks super cheesy.  But there's this super rich, ultra-industrialist who's going to release a bioweapon to kill the entire population of the Earth  while he goes off world to a space station.  And then they're going to return after the bioweapon has dissipated.  It's designed to, you know, wind down on its own and then repopulate with super people. 
[01:37:00]  They believe that the general public are a bunch of ugly, stunted drones and that they are going to, quote,  cull the herd of the useless feeders and that they're going to come back and save the Earth and perfect mankind.  They're going to play God.  Yeah.  And that's what they believe in.  Didn't Hitler think the same thing, though?  Come on.  Absolutely.  This isn't a new idea.  But if you go back, Hitler, on record, was given his funding by the Rockefeller Foundation.  They funded Cold Springs Harbor that was the eugenics office that is now the Human Genome Project office. 
[01:37:30]  Remember, just two years ago, the head of the Human Genome had to step down, Dr. Watson, because he said blacks weren't human.  He was the discoverer of the double helix, Nobel Prize winner.  I mean, just a horrible person.  And Hitler was funded at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.  It was that he went a little too wild for them and kind of exposed them.  So they went ahead and smashed him. 
[01:38:00]  He's what they call a bad son.  You know, if you've got a tree out in your yard and an acre is falling, there's a bunch of little trees come up in the spring.  And, you know, the lawn guy says, you want me to cut those, those bad sons?  Hitler was an aberration who accelerated their program and went after just one or two groups.  They want to go after basically everyone.  And all I'm doing is, all I'm doing, and I cover this in my film, End Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.  And, by the way, it is free.  I know people would care and pay more attention, but I said they could buy the DVD. 
[01:38:30]  People don't appreciate things that are free.  But it's a very well-done film.  And it's at the bottom of the article that's on the Drudge Report and also up on Infowars.com and PrisonPundit.com.  Is mass bird and fish die off connected to government testing?  Gentlemen, I am now fully awake, and I would love to be on your powerfully transmitted, huge broadcast.  But can I, I literally rolled out of bed.  Yes, yes.  Five minutes to get a coffee. 
[01:39:00]  Well, now that you're awake, I think we can, yeah, let you go.  I had a question for Alex.  Talk to me now that I'm awake, because I can break down the whole bird thing, the Abu Dhabi thing, the weather.  What just happened for the last 20 minutes?  Troy has a question, though.  Troy has a question, Troy.  Do you mind if I ask you a question, Alex?  Yes.  Just about chemtrails and what's going on, who is responsible for chemtrails and putting aluminum in the atmosphere?  Hang on one second.  I want to answer the question, but I'm over Berlin right now. 
[01:39:30]  Please call me back in two minutes.  All right, we'll do this.  He has to shit.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  He has to shit.  Wait a minute.  Now he's ready to talk?  I'm so happy that the one guy who really backs him asked a question.  He had a log brewing.  Well, Troy questions things.  I know.  Yeah.  We've got to get you a question jacket.  Yes.  Troy does question things.  Where can I get a sweater that matches my sneakers in color?  Did the Riddler have a lot of question marks on his jacket?  Yes, he did.  We've got to get you one of those.  Yeah, the Riddler.  Sounds good. 
[01:40:00]  And you're only allowed in here if you put on your question jacket.  And you have to leap in as the Riddler would.  Make Riddler noises.  Troy Neutron, everyone.  It's fine.  That works.  Yeah, obviously, you guys don't watch Jimmy Neutron, do you?  I just can't believe we're holding a global enslaved.  Give me a Jimmy Neutron picture, Danny, please.  I just can't buy it.  They're calling it Quanspiracy.  Quanspiracy?  Right, too.  Quandry.  Very good.  There you go.  There's Troy. 
[01:40:30]  He's got the hair.  Yeah?  Yeah.  There you go.  Bob's Big Boy.  That works, too.  Yeah, we've heard that one.  Sure.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know what's wrong with asking questions about things.  But your hero didn't even want to hear your question.  Yeah, I know.  He's not really my hero.  I mean, I've seen some of his films, and I find him interesting, Jim.  Joe Rogan's a big fan of the Riddler Jones.  Yeah, so is Patrice.  Patrice has been on his show a bunch of times.  What is Patrice now, though?  I don't know.  I heard him on Alex's show.  You can find it online.  He's very well-spoken and has a lot to say about it. 
[01:41:00]  Where is Alex based out of Dallas?  Austin, I believe.  Oh, is he in Austin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going on.  I mean, there's just a lot of people that are taking what he says and go, oh, okay.  It's not what the mainstream news is reporting, but I find this interesting.  And I don't really think there's anything wrong with asking questions.  I think when you're not asking questions, there's a problem with that.  Here it comes.  Oh, that was your statement.  Troy's got questions.  That's all I know.  He does have a lot of questions. 
[01:41:30]  Nothing wrong with having questions.  I do, too.  You've got questions.  Where's my food?  Can we go to break?  Sure.  I got a little something before we go to break that I'm going to play for everybody here.  And thank you, Troy.  You all right?  What's up?  You all right?  Yeah, of course.  I wanted my question answered, though.  So.  All right.  Maybe it'll happen.  I already know the answer to it.  Yeah.  I don't know if we're going to let Alex back on.  He had a shot.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Okay.  First this, and then we'll be back.  Whoa, that's a full rainbow now.  All the way. 
[01:42:00]  Double rainbow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It's a double rainbow all the way.  Wow.  Whoa.  That's so intense.  Wow.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Woo.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That's the biggest thing ever.  Woo.  That's so big.  Double rainbow all the way across the sky. 
[01:42:30]  So high that they touched the moon.  Could you go to heaven with that?  It's so beautiful.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  What else is going on in the world today? 
[01:43:00]  He's talked about the birds.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Don Shuler's 81 today?  Wow.  Wow.  Where did that time go, huh?  And Michael Stite made it to 51.  Good for him.  Damn.  The REM dude.  Man, well, well, well, well. 
[01:43:30]  51.  Oh, we got the editor-in-chief of Deadspin.com coming in in about a half hour.  It's a good sports site.  Sports blog site, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it straight ahead sports, or is it those quirky little stories of dick pics?  Exactly.  Right?  I'm just doing a Troy Kwan.  I just ask questions.  I just want to do Troy now all the time.  Well, they're the website that broke the whole fire thing.  Yeah, exactly.  Just to give you an idea of what they do. 
[01:44:00]  See, they question things.  Good question.  Yeah.  I think this will be Troy.  Ask our question.  I love the Troy.  He's all right in my book.  Hey.  Hey, what do we got?  There was something.  Oh, the fucking hepatitis thing.  I teased it.  So, really quickly, there's a church in Massapequa.  Massapequa.  Massapequa.  Massapequa.  Do you know how they hand out the wafers?  The communion wafer.  Why can't they make that shit taste a little better, Bobby?  Body of Christ.  Because it's the body of Christ. 
[01:44:30]  So what?  He didn't want to eat good.  What do you want?  Vanilla?  Chocolate?  A fucking vanilla.  Caramel?  A little vanilla flavoring in the wafer would be just fine.  Yeah.  It would taste just like the lactate pills I take every morning.  Oh, a little lactate?  It probably would taste like lactate.  A little chalky, a little vanilla-y.  Yes.  So, one of the assholes at the church, I don't know if it was the priest himself.  I think it might have been one of his helpers.  You know, you get some of the helpers. 
[01:45:00]  Had the hepatitis A.  Oh, boy.  Now, the hepatitis A, for the people that didn't know, I didn't really know until today myself.  You get from, like, food.  Handling food.  Oh, shit.  So.  It's an easy one to get.  Hepatitis A is very easy to get.  That's the curable one.  Commonly spread by consuming food or drink that was handled by an infected person.  So you could get that very easy if you're eating out a lot.  Someone at a restaurant's got that.  You get it.  Oh, of course. 
[01:45:30]  I don't like that.  So, somebody helping out the father or the father himself.  Hey, that father.  Had the hepatitis A, and now they're handling the little wafers to everybody.  She loves to taste the communion wafers, father.  Yes.  She loves to taste the communion wafers.  Hey, can you help an old Walter boy, father?  Remember the exorcist?  Yeah.  Father.  So, they're thinking a lot of people might have the hep A now because of this unidentified  person who handled the communion wafers could have transmitted the illness to the parishioners, 
[01:46:00]  Anthony.  Father Tommy Lee?  Oh.  So, here's the deal.  If you were at Mass at the Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church in Massapequa at the  1030 a.m. or noon Masses on December 25th, that would be Christmas Mass.  And you're turning yellow from jaundice.  And you might have a little yellow happening.  Yeah.  You might want to go back to the church, they're saying, to get some shots. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, boy.  At the church, they're going to give you shots?  I believe so, yeah.  In the rectory?  Anyone who received the bread wafers should report for inoculation at the church this week.  So, they're setting up shop at the church all week, and you can come in and go, fuck,  I had one of those wafers, give me a shot.  Symptoms of hepatitis A include an abrupt onset of fever, fatigue, poor appetite, nausea,  and stomach pain.  That sounds like what people get from the show.  That's what I was thinking.  I thought it was management.  I think I might have the hep A. 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  And then, yeah.  The hep A.  Yeah, get his fucking commercials off our channel, by the way, if he doesn't want Ira on our show.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  Fucking Jay Thomas has his shit running on our channel, but he won't let his guy come on here.  Fuck him, and I want Rob and Gary to remove his promos immediately.  Thank you.  Anthony, you're right.  A little jaundice happens, too.  A little jaundice.  A yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. 
[01:47:30]  Oh.  I thought when your eyes are nice and white, that's good.  That means you're healthy, though.  Yeah, but that's a yellowing of the whites of the eyes.  Yellowing of...  No.  What?  Yeah, you get yellowing of the skin.  A yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.  Ah!  Yellowing of the skin and yellowing of the whites of the eyes.  So your white goes away.  Gotcha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gotcha.  A little jaundice-y.  Sounds pretty fucked up, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't know you could get hepatitis A that easily.  From communion wafers.  Ah. 
[01:48:00]  Can't you get that from...  Oh, you can get that from eating ass, too.  Hepatitis A, you can't get it from eating ass.  Can you?  Yeah.  Shit.  Does it go away on its own?  The desire to eat ass?  How do you get rid of it?  Yeah, does it just go away, or do you have to get shots?  What do they give you?  I don't know.  No, I don't know.  Well, yeah, it's transmitted through fecal matter.  You'll notice, your skin's eyes get yellow, and you begin to feel jaundiced, and you get 
[01:48:30]  some type of anal sapage.  I'm tired.  Wow, Dr. Steve just texted me.  That's good.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I don't want him on the show today.  He's a dreck.  I'm tired, too.  I get tired, though.  Wait a minute.  Maybe that's it.  Dude, I swear to God, I'm reading this now.  Hep A is transmitted by the fecal-oral root.  So someone has to take shit on their hands to transmit it.  Oh, so if someone wipes their ass.  Or you can get it by the way, but that's just the most popular. 
[01:49:00]  I didn't read that before.  Most popular.  If someone, like, shits and wipes, and they get a little on their finger, and then they  serve food to you, and some of that fecal matter gets in your mouth, first of all, that's  disgusting right away.  What if you just take the log right from the asshole?  Say, thank you, mistress.  We got a churchgoer saying, doesn't the wafer turn into the body of Christ?  How does it have hep on it?  Thank you, Ralph from Virginia.  That's a fine question.  Christ was doing dope.  We need to ask questions, Anthony. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What about that?  Lots of questions.  Good question.  That's a good question.  Good question.  Jay Thomas was on Rana Fez.  Well, then let us have Ira on our show, asshole.  We treat Ira nice over here.  Do we, though?  Yes, we do.  We can talk about blow, Jim.  Zach in Cleveland is going to tell us how our show is run.  Go ahead, Zach.  What's up, gentlemen?  Good morning.  Good morning.  I find that sometimes, you know, Jimmy's funny, but then sometimes there'll just be a 
[01:50:00]  story.  Some guy will be talking about, like, you know, he's a little boy, he's flying a kite, and  all of a sudden, Jimmy will jump in with, yeah, he's flying a kite, and it's got balls  on it, and a giant cock hat.  And then, it's not funny, but Anthony jumps in with, oh, hi, hi, he's bad boy.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and then Opie's like, oh, okay, I guess we're talking about this  now.  So then he goes, oh, you rock.  You got balls, right? 
[01:50:30]  Come on out.  Show everybody your balls.  Are you busy?  All right.  Maybe we should take a break.  If you take a break, I will take a break.  All right, that's all I got.  But what do you mean, balls?  Sorry.  I never jumped in with one.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, your example isn't funny, but the examples that Jimmy gives...  It almost works.  It's kind of, you know, it is funny.  But the character yesterday, for example, I'm not digging the character from yesterday with the wild-eyed Jimmy. 
[01:51:00]  Like, wow, shoot to the moon!  That was very...  Dude, how is that a balls...  You're talking about a character where you have to do 20 hours a week of new content.  So I try a wide-eyed boy, which pleases most of the people.  The cutest factor went right through the roof.  It was well accepted.  It was like a box full of kittens.  Which means you're the problem, and maybe you go find something else to listen to, I guess.  You sure know the show, though.  Yeah, there are times we know we completely suck and the audience hates what we did. 
[01:51:30]  But the Jim character from yesterday was a huge fucking hit.  Huge.  So if everybody...  You just came up with the worst example, to make your point, is what I'm saying.  Yes, sir.  Look, I don't happen to like that character, but I think in general that Jimmy will take a joke  and just add the word balls or cock to it or something, and then Anthony will just start laughing.  Give me an example.  Give me an example.  Yeah, yeah.  Like I was saying, just, you know, just even a second ago, we were talking about hepatitis A.  It was like a regular discussion, and then he's like, he's like, you can get hep A from eating ass. 
[01:52:00]  You can.  Well, you can.  But that's one of the big ways to fucking get the hep A.  Dummy, you can get, that is one of the big ways to get hepatitis A as opposed to C, which is more from needles, I believe.  So that was actually accurate.  Yeah, I'm sure it was accurate, but everything has to do with cock or balls.  Like, there's no, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  But that's just not true.  Like, like, like, like, if I said, hey, uh, Zach, your father has a cock and balls in his mouth right now. 
[01:52:30]  Like that, that would be what I would do.  Or your mom is able to take a cock in her ass and balls in her fucking rancid cunt at the same time, right?  Sure.  All right, just wanted to be sure.  Okay, I just, but that's not funny, and that's why you don't make those.  No, it's not funny.  No, no, I didn't mean it to be funny.  I meant it to be accurate.  All I'm asking you for is an accurate, criticism I can take, but just give you an accurate reference. 
[01:53:00]  I said something actually as a statement of fact.  You really can't get hep A from eating ass.  That's how you get, a big way to get it.  That's fine, but look, I've looked at people a while.  What happened?  Did a priest eat your ass when you were a kid, and you got a little upset?  Uh, no.  At the honest subject matter?  All right, sorry.  What's the matter?  Not your brand, not your brand of comedy. 
[01:53:30]  Why don't you go just turn something else on?  Turn something else on.  I love the show.  No, no, no.  You don't.  You don't.  Just say, you know, why don't we hang up on them?  I don't have them.  Because it felt like it.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't done with them.  Okay.  I hate that guy.  He was making that point as I was hanging up, where I wouldn't have hung up.  Fuck him.  Of course, fuck him.  I like making him look silly.  I guess.  Hey, we were talking about Scared Straight from 1974, and Sam, out of nowhere, got some 
[01:54:00]  of the quality clips from this show.  The original scared shit.  If a guy doesn't like me, just call it and say you don't like me.  Don't try to be clever with anything.  That's what's annoying.  That's a woman's quality.  Just call me and go, I'm not a fan.  I don't like you.  I probably fucked his wife or his girlfriend.  You put your balls on her.  Really?  I probably did.  I probably sent a picture of my cock to his wife or girlfriend.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Sorry, pal.  Tell him not to give her number out.  That'll fucking do it.  How many guys blame you because they're chicks or pigs?  He's been emasculated because the Norton hog has been in his girlfriend's vagina or 
[01:54:30]  asshole.  You just popped on, sir.  I didn't do nothing there.  Hey, who is this?  Parker from Tyler.  All right.  You're on now.  What do you got?  How the hell do you come out against the beloved Jimmy Norton?  I can understand that.  He brings to the show.  I'm very opinionated and I do annoy a lot of people and that's acceptable.  I just wouldn't.  If you don't call up with a bullshit example, like that's what annoyed me. 
[01:55:00]  It was like, oh, the kite.  Like, don't give an example of a joke you didn't like that I told.  Don't say that someone says kite and I go, oh, the ball is cocked.  Because I don't say that.  Repeat a joke that you thought sucked.  All right.  Fair enough.  But you didn't.  It's very, very difficult to throw you under the bus on any joke, Jimmy.  I mean, you are always killing on this show.  You're a good man, but I bought a plenty.  Thank you.  Thanks, buddy.  Well, I appreciate it, guys.  Punching out.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, and I can't hang up on him. 
[01:55:30]  I'll hang up.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, I appreciate it because I can't hang up on you.  He just popped on and, oh, boy.  I got to turn off the phone pots.  Oh, boy.  We'll try to fix the phones during the break, I guess.  Oh, boy.  Whatever.  Okay.  We got Scared Straight Clips from 1974 because there's a new version of the show coming out  and we know the time.  There's a lot of cocks and balls in it. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  E-Rock, get in here.  Oh, God.  And we got to talk about Huckleberry Finn before A.J. comes in from Deadspin.com.  Let's not forget.  Literary classic.  Scared Straight, 1974.  78.  Was it 78?  Yeah.  Okay.  You know 78?  Are you really?  Oh, yeah.  It was 78.  Okay.  Why?  Does Sam write 74?  Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.  That dope.  That's just creepy you know it's 78.  Well, because they did 20 years later in 98.  Oh. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, but that's still fucked up.  Then how do you know that?  I'll be Googling it.  Hold on.  Scared shit.  Hold on.  Let me go.  Could they have done the 20th anniversary in 94?  Well, in 78 I was 10.  So it's like I remember watching that on TV.  You remember?  Yeah, 1978.  As you were sucking a penis?  Yeah.  As there was a black man actually yelling at my face.  I said, I double dare you to rate me.  He straightened me right out.  Sorry to the comedy.  Oh, yes.  The alt comedy guy who called up.  Riddick.  I don't go for that. 
[01:57:00]  Cunt.  They break it down to one dumb thing, too.  It's just like.  Just give an accurate example.  Yeah.  They break down everything we do to one dumb thing.  Ass.  But he raised dick jokes.  And then he said he didn't like the wow cow.  It's like you just, you raised two different things.  Yeah.  So just call up and say, look, I probably talked to your pig girlfriend one time.  She contacted me on Facebook.  She asked for a picture of my cock and I sent it to her.  Yeah.  And she probably sent a picture of her pussy and she won't give you that.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That gets them mad. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, boy.  Who do the fucking guys annoy me?  My wife.  Shut up.  And the wow cow.  Dump her then.  Was massively huge yesterday.  What's that?  It was kind of silly.  Yeah, but then we got a production piece with the double rainbow guy, which was very funny.  Which was my idea.  I made that up.  All right.  So scared straight.  There's a new version coming out.  1978 was the original and the language was a bit salty.  They got away with a lot of language.  Yes, they did.  Which I do believe will not be the same with the new episode. 
[01:58:00]  Are they not going to curse on A&E?  Probably a little bit.  I bet they curse somewhat.  Jimmy, you forgot to talk about it.  Maybe not even.  Remember the clip where they talked about ass eating?  Or getting fucked in the ass?  I mean, they got really wrong with the original scared straight.  Yeah, they were threatening.  Scared straight.  Why don't we get into these clips?  They were wonderful.  Prisoner shows the kids the prison cards.  He slaps them out of a kid's hand.  So we know what's going on.  You've got some kids in trouble.  This is from 78. 
[01:58:30]  So you brought the kids into the jail to scare the shit out of them.  Yeah.  So they don't end up in jail.  Everybody see these cards?  Everybody see these motherfucking cards?  Let me tell you something, man.  When I ask a question, I want to ask it from all of y'all.  Now, do everybody see these cards?  Yeah.  I want you to look at one man and pass it down.  I want you to see them all.  Motherfucker, what did I say?  What did I say, motherfucker? 
[01:59:00]  Now, pick them up and look at them right.  Hurry up.  Pick them goddamn cards up.  You don't get all them cards, clown?  Because if I tell you again, I'm going to break your fucking neck.  Now, did you see them all?  Yeah.  I'm going to try this the last time, man.  The last fucking time.  Don't get on my fucking nerves, all right?  You look at one and pass it down to him.  I'll show you them cards for one reason.  I'll let y'all know that we ain't no social workers, no counselors, no probation officers, or no police.  We are convicts. 
[01:59:30]  Every man you see behind me is doing over 25 years of life.  So y'all ain't come in here and change nothing.  Now, is that understood?  Fuck.  And then the great, that guy, the kids before were all talking shit like they were tough.  And then one guy's like, hey, I'm just going to talk back.  And they always show these kids being fucking humiliated and cowed by these.  And they start crying.  That's great.  Here's the clip.  A prisoner explains love in prison. 
[02:00:00]  Love.  Oh, that's sweet.  I'm sure some of you guys have got girlfriends, right?  Oh, no.  I can't hate.  You girls got boyfriends?  I can't hate.  Yeah, yeah.  I know you guys all got sexual desires, right?  Oh, boy.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we got sexual desires, too.  We're just like you.  We made of flesh and blood.  You tough guy.  Take a wild guess.  When we got sexual desires, who do you think we get?  And don't tell me each other. 
[02:00:30]  Who?  You don't know, huh?  Well, I'll tell you.  We get young, dumb motherfuckers just like you.  Like I told you, I've been out here 10 years.  And I'm going to die in this stinking joint.  And if they wanted you to give me these three bitches right here, I would leap over with them  like a kangaroo just to get the one pretty, young, fat butt boy.  I'm telling you, you guys.  Damn.  And not only me, there's a lot of guys in there that do the same thing.  And so we're in life in these joints. 
[02:01:00]  One day you're laying on your blanket, and your mind is drifting over them 30-foot walls.  And you're thinking about who's with your girl.  When three guys will slide into your cellar, wrap your ass up in that blanket,  and I don't care how tough you think you are or how strong you might be,  they're going to kick your ass over the side of that bed  and do bottomy arms to your asshole by sticking a dick in it.  Holy shit.  I don't think it's just getting hard.  I don't think the new version is going to talk like that.  I know. 
[02:01:30]  No, no.  I can't see that happening.  I think it's going to be a little different.  I can't see that happening.  I can't see that happening in the new version.  That clip made me want to go to jail.  How fun to make friends.  Wrapped in a blanket with your bare asshole hanging over the edge of the bed and pounded.  You have plausible deniability.  There was three of them.  At least they keep you warm as they're violating your asshole.  Right.  That's nice of them.  Wrapped in a blankie.  All wrapped nice in a blankie.  The prisoner explains security in prison.  In the ten years I've been here, I've seen it a thousand times. 
[02:02:00]  You're going to walk around this joint or any joint you might be in.  And you're going to find a guy that's real quiet.  Nobody bothers him and he don't bother nobody.  He's got all respect in the world.  You're going to approach this guy and say, hey my man, I got a very serious problem.  Can you help me?  And after you run it down to him, he's going to tell you yeah.  And it seemed like five minutes after he said yeah, it's like somebody got on the PA system and told 1,300 wild maniacs not to bother you. 
[02:02:30]  And now you're telling yourself, hey, this guy was all right.  He got all this pressure off of me.  And nah, he ain't did nothing.  The only thing this guy did was he told population that you are his property.  You are his kid.  And when you become somebody's kid in one of these joints, there's the things you got to do.  You got to get up in the morning and get his coffee.  You got to clean his cell.  You got to wash his drawers and socks.  And if he wants some head, you will give it to him. 
[02:03:00]  And if he want to fuck you in your ass, you'll let him.  And if he want to sell you to another prisoner, he'll do that too.  Like marriage.  See, they're going to put lipstick on your lips, earrings in your ear, and now you're swishing your ass up and down these tears, hustling cigarettes for your man.  And for you tough motherfuckers like you.  See, when you entertain the thought of telling this guy, nah, man, I ain't about that bullshit.  I ain't going to do it.  Well, the only thing you're telling this guy is to take your life, clown. 
[02:03:30]  Because that's what he's going to do.  Why isn't this program bigger?  Yeah.  Because who the fuck would get in trouble after hearing these guys?  They all went straight.  All of them went straight except for one guy.  I understand the dumb little shit we all do, but why would you do the real shit after hearing this?  The one guy just wanted to get fucked in the ass so bad.  No, the one guy...  I got in trouble afterwards.  I stole something in the prison commissary.  And then turned myself in. 
[02:04:00]  But the one guy who said afterwards, he goes, I was there just to steal your equipment.  He was like a real hardcore criminal.  And he actually went to jail for like 10 years.  Or no, more than 10.  He spent a lot of his life there.  These guys should be going to the fucking schools.  Every school in America should have this program.  That first dude who yelled and knocked the cards out.  His name is Willie.  Willie?  Yeah, he's out now.  Oh, he is?  But these guys were in for murder and stuff, weren't they?  A lot of them did 20 years, maybe more.  So they did their 20? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  A prisoner disregards the kid's comfort.  Slide your goddamn ass back.  Squeeze the fucking...  I don't care if you're uncomfortable.  I've been uncomfortable for four goddamn years.  What the hell am I care about you being uncomfortable now?  You got something in your head you want out?  Because if you move your hand one more time,  you ain't going to have to worry about it  because I'm going to kick that right off the top of your goddamn head.  You understand that?  See, because I don't like nothing in the first place 
[02:05:00]  and I don't like you.  You move one more goddamn time  and I'll bite your fucking nose off  and spit it in your damn face.  You understand that?  Oh, shit.  That goes for you, too.  Because just as quick as I'll kick him in the goddamn ass,  I'll do the same thing to you.  You don't put no damn tears in your eyes.  What the fuck I care about some tears?  Shit.  Jeez.  That guy, I recognize his voice. 
[02:05:30]  He's out.  Yeah.  But then he went back.  I think his name is Malik.  He went back to jail.  Like, that was the one who went back to jail  and his son was in jail with him.  His son's doing 25 years, too.  Ah, that's cute.  Yes, that was bad news.  Yeah.  This is...  It's more of the injustice that goes on in this country.  Yeah, we're listening to the clips of  Scare Straight from 1978.  Yeah.  Because there's a new version that's coming out soon on,  I guess, A&E.  Yes.  A prisoner quietly threatens a young man's life.  The police can make a thousand mistakes. 
[02:06:00]  Remember this guy.  You can only make one mistake and you're done.  You understand?  You understand?  What, am I here to amuse you that you smile?  Yeah.  Huh?  Something's funny?  Something's funny with you?  Get this smile off your face, brother.  Still smiling?  Let me tell you something.  I'll break your nose off your head.  You can think somebody's gonna stop me from going.  Believe me, if you want.  Because by the time they get here,  it'll be too late, it'll be all over with. 
[02:06:30]  I got so much time, they can't give me no more.  You understand what I'm telling you?  So when you sit there, you keep that smile off your face.  Because I'm gonna hurt you.  All right?  Don't make me hurt you.  Don't make me hurt you, darling.  Please.  I thought it'd be a nice fact.  That's probably the most horrifying clip right there.  Dominic.  I believe he died of AIDS, that guy.  Oh, yeah.  I think he died of AIDS.  What?  I think so.  Yeah, he was a white guy. 
[02:07:00]  He was a...  That's way more horrifying than the yelling and screaming.  Yeah.  Scared, straight.  God, Jimmy really knows this show.  I've seen it.  It's been a long time, and I remember...  I remember it.  I loved it.  How did he get the AIDS?  I'm gonna guess drugs.  I want to think three gay guys.  Well, maybe.  Three guys that fucked a mini ass.  Maybe it was a combo platter.  See how cocky these kids are?  This is them talking shit.  Oh, yeah.  Look at them talking shit, these guys.  They...  Yeah.  There's no sound? 
[02:07:30]  There's no sound.  They're just saying, like, hey, man, if the black kid was going, hey, if he talks to me,  I'm gonna talk back.  Like, they're gonna talk shit.  Oh, really?  And then they show him being cowed.  Idiot with a big cheeky on his neck.  Half-blind prisoner throws the kid's shoes.  This is what Jimmy was talking about earlier.  I'm gonna tell you about the prison.  But before I do, show me your shoes.  Show me your shoes.  Show me which ones are yours.  Tell me.  This one here?  Which one is yours? 
[02:08:00]  Which one?  This one right here?  You smiling at me again?  I was knocking you in the motherfucking mouth with this shoe.  You smiling at me?  Knock it off.  Close your mouth.  I don't like none of you.  This is how I think about you.  Think the fuck about you.  Nothing.  Go home and bear it, please, you faggot.  Everything I tell you today up here, I'm gonna show it to you in black.  I'm in for murder, kidnapping, robbery, arm robbery, conspiracy, breaking the dude's jaw, and breaking his fucking woman's bow for a goddamn arm. 
[02:08:30]  Jesus.  I'm in for conspiracy.  I'm in for conspiracy.  Balls tight.  He rocks fat.  Fast forward to the next guy.  I mean, to Danny, the video.  You can see the guy with the missing eye.  I don't like you.  Oh, there you go.  I don't like you.  Yeah.  You got one time to smile at me.  I'm gonna turn your teeth upside down. 
[02:09:00]  Do you understand me?  I just got out the whole of the day, and I will turn your teeth upside down.  Do you dig it?  Yes.  All right.  He's still smiling.  I'm gonna tell you about the prison.  But before I do, show me your shoe.  You should zip.  We just heard this.  Show me your shoe.  Turn, my love.  He just heaves up.  Go home bad, buddy, you faggot.  Faggot.  Everything I tell you today up here, I'm gonna show it to you in black and white.  I'm in for murder, kidnapping, robbery, arm robbery, conspiracy, breaking the dude's jaw, 
[02:09:30]  and breaking his fucking woman's bow for a goddamn arm.  That's all?  But fuck what's happening to me.  That's what's happening to the juveniles we're concerned about.  Why do you care?  It's pretty bad what happens to young boys when they come in somebody's prison, ain't it?  Ain't it?  Yeah.  You think that's fair?  This is even better.  Girls beaten and raped.  18 years old. 
[02:10:00]  She's been molested 11 times by other women in the prison.  All the girls have the Farrah Fawcett flip.  Yeah.  She must have been hot.  Yeah.  They're talking about getting tough on juveniles.  Shut the fuck up and chin.  Shut the fuck up and chin.  Dick, get the fuck out of here.  Get up and get off the stage, my king.  Get your shoes and get the fuck out of here.  Fuck, King.  You know he means it in this case.  Other people say that like, shut the fuck up and chin.  I'll slap your hair off your head. 
[02:10:30]  Slap the hair off your head.  They're talking about getting tough on juveniles.  They say if you commit a crime like an adult, they're gonna send you to an adult prison.  But you don't care, man.  You don't care.  You want to be here with me.  You want to be in the cell next to me.  I don't think so.  See, we know all about juveniles.  How do we know?  We were juveniles one time ourselves.  No.  Everything that you're doing now, we done did it.  We didn't get away with nothing.  We're here.  So what makes you think you're gonna get away with it?  Tell me. 
[02:11:00]  I get to walk out the front door.  Listen to our name and the time that we're doing.  Listen to it.  Give me some names over there, time.  5-5-3-7-2-3-8.  5-6-0-8-3, double life.  5-2-1-4-9, life.  5-6-0-9-3-7-8.  5-1-2-5-8, 30 years.  5-4-9-3-6, life and from motherfucking now on.  Now who know what now on means?  He got out, right?  He did get out. 
[02:11:30]  Somebody tell me.  All right, so.  Yeah, all right, very good.  Now, till the day you die, no, you get out.  Because the system sucks dick.  I love that guy, though.  He's great.  He looks like a problem.  Well, he tells me what happened to his fucking...  Yeah, I think we got that clip coming up.  Prisoner explains his injuries.  5-4-9-3-6, life and from motherfucking now on.  Now who know what now on means?  From now on.  Somebody tell me.  Forever till the day I die.  That means I'm never going to hit the street no more.  See, I was like you when I came to prison, man. 
[02:12:00]  I was wild.  Nobody couldn't tell me a motherfucking thing.  I didn't want to hear it.  But you know how they showed me?  By taking my motherfucking eye right out of my head.  Look.  You see it?  Stabbed me all up in the front and in the motherfucking back.  How motherfucking tough could I have been?  Tell me.  See, you got that fucked up attitude.  You want to be like me.  Well.  And the first...  Sit up, man.  Sit up.  Do they really take his eye?  Yeah, I think so. 
[02:12:30]  He's all stabbed up in this...  Jeez.  He lifts up his shirt.  I think he's all...  He must have been a punk-ass motherfucker.  Yeah, he's all...  All he can do is yell at fucking school kids, shut up.  He's a...  He's a...  When he gets out, though, he's a fucking decent citizen.  You can see with his family, he's like, I'm never going back.  Oh, he's old.  Yeah, he's fucking...  Oh, God.  He did at least 20 years.  That's great.  I want to see what these guys look like now.  They show him.  It's online.  So we're...  But they say they helped a lot of people.  I mean, uh...  Of course they did.  This original group helped a lot of fucking people. 
[02:13:00]  Of course.  A prisoner...  And they do this program more than just for the show, right?  Yeah, they think they had been doing this before the show.  For a while, and then they finally filmed it.  And finally, one more clip from Scare Straight 1978.  A prisoner explains obtaining property in prison.  Oh, yeah.  Come here.  Pretty big dude, ain't you?  Six foot.  Six foot.  Yeah, that's it.  You got your best shot, man.  One punch.  Punch me in my face.  It is my turn.  No punch.  Motherfucker punch.  Damn.  You kill me. 
[02:13:30]  Huh?  You'll kill me.  Yeah, you need protection, don't you?  Yeah.  Come here.  Everybody gonna bother you.  Stay with me.  Bad guy.  Oh, boy.  Grab it, motherfucker.  Grab it.  Make some grab his belt.  This is mine now.  This kind of shit ain't going all day in the motherfucker prison.  This shit.  A young, dumb motherfucker that can't make it.  So he needs somebody to take care of him.  You got any cigarettes?  Mm.  Anybody got a cigarette?  If he just bought this, I can do bad for my motherfucker's self.  Go over there with him.  You belong to him now.  Ah.  His motherfucker manhood man just been tested. 
[02:14:00]  And he failed.  Because he should have punched my motherfucking head off.  That's what he should have did, but he didn't.  Now he belong to somebody else.  Ah, shit.  Ah, see, he should have punched his head.  Yeah, when somebody...  Is that bad?  ...to grab the man's belt loop is probably a sign of weakness.  Yeah, and be led around and then sold for a cigarette.  That's just what I'd be doing, trying to keep my funny face on him.  Your funny face.  But then that guy has someone to talk to about the Jets-Colts game.  You think that's it?  Yeah, have a little banter and talk now.  I don't think he'll be talking. 
[02:14:30]  I think his mouth is full a lot.  Grabbo Kid from North Dakota.  Until forever?  Wow!  That's so long!  Does anybody know how long that is?  Till the sun goes away?  Oh, no!  Fuck. 
[02:15:00]  You know what?  I don't want to watch the new Scared Straight now.  It's going to be fucking awful.  Compared to the original.  Especially since it's cable and they can say whatever they want,  but now they won't.  It's going to be PC even in prison.  I do love one guy from the 20 Year Later special.  I told you the guy who's just yelling in someone's face  and you know his breath is horrible.  Oh, God, really?  His spit's flying at you.  He's great.  I'd love to yell at somebody like that.  Just once I want to yell at my girlfriend like that.  Inmate Nagel? 
[02:15:30]  I was like you before I came to prison.  I fit in my clothes.  I knew when to say no for dessert.  I know.  Why?  It's just always.  We're going to talk about Huckleberry Finn after the break.  Oh.  Before AJ from Deadspin.com comes in. 
[02:16:00]  You're not allowed to say certain things anymore.  Sports blog.  No.  Sports blog guy who does a very good job.  But before that, Danny, the Rick Ashley thing.  The Rick roll?  Yeah.  Rick Astley.  Astley.  Yeah, I've always fucked that up.  Rick Astley.  Thank you.  Rick Astley.  What is this about?  It's the...  Well, I...  I remember the Metallica guy who took like just the vocals and made it into a cool jazz song.  Yeah, like a jazzy Enter Sam.  It's the same guy.  Remember that? 
[02:16:30]  We played it on the show a few times.  He does this a bunch, I guess, and he puts all these videos up on YouTube.  So I kind of forgot about him.  And then I remembered and I found some stuff on, I think it was Fark or wherever it was  today.  And I think it's just some of his latest stuff.  He did a death metal Rick roll.  Rick Astley.  Never going to give you up.  And if anybody's interested after that, there's more.  And speaking of weird shit like this, you know that Hyundai commercial we were beating  up yesterday?  We're so fucking sick of it.  Uh-huh.  From the hipsters from San Francisco, Pompla Moose or whatever they're called.  One of the guys did a version of Nutcracker Suite. 
[02:17:00]  Now I fucking love the guy.  It's online and it did just stupid views.  Someone turned me on to it on Twitter.  What does Nutcracker Suite sound like regular?  Bing, bing.  Can you find that possibly really fast?  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  I know we're off-roading, but.  He's got it. 
[02:17:30]  He's nailing it.  He just fucking nailed it.  How did we find this?  Fuck.  Pompla Moose?  Yeah, it's the other guy from.  It should be on his YouTube site. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, his name's Jack Conte.  Put in Jack Conte.  We got it.  Right.  Dance of the...  Yeah, there it is.  Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.  Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.  Maybe that's different.  Oh, is that why...  You know what British singers do?  I've heard the Beatles doing this.  They go, Sugar Plum Fairy.  Sugar Plum Fairy.  Is that where this is from?  Really?  No?  Listen to this version of this song.  This song is rolling over in his grave. 
[02:18:30]  Yes, again. 
[02:19:00]  It's one guy, by the way.  I kick this in my hand.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[02:19:30]  One guy, by the way.  That's it.  How do you play all his instruments at once?  He's magic. 
[02:20:00]  This guy's busy.  That's the dude that's in that commercial with the chick.  Yeah, yeah.  With the fucking dead eyes.  The wacky chick that doesn't look at the camera.  Right.  Jack Conte, if you're looking online.  C-O-N-T-E.  All right.  Hey, so the Rick Astley thing.  Yeah.  So the Metallica dude that did the cool jazz version.  Yeah, he did a metal-y version.  Again, with the original vocals from Rick Astley.  And again, just like this guy, it's all the same guy. 
[02:20:30]  One guy does everything.  So it's kind of interesting to listen to.  Hmm.  We're no strangers to love.  You know the rules.  And so do I.  I feel commitment's what I'm thinking of

Pretty much for a 41-year-old  And then, uh  Rick DiPietro got a hip injury yesterday  But with all this going on  The Islanders have some weird  Fucking crazy winning streak going on  Yes  So with that  We say hi to AJ  From Deadspin.com  How's it going?  Uh  Good  We've just been, uh  Fucking hanging around here  Doing pretty much nothing  All morning  Excellent  I'm a fan of your site, sir  Thank you very much, sir  I appreciate it  And, uh  TedWilliamsHead.com 
[02:28:00]  Is a big fan of your site, too  Yeah, I noticed that  I think he  I think he tried to work for you  And then realized he can't  So he's doing his own thing  Oh, really?  But he loves Deadspin.com as well  And you guys were the ones  That broke the, uh  Brett Favre of Jen Sturger story  So people know, right?  Yeah  Huge story  How the fuck did you break that?  I had a conversation with Jen  Last February  And she told me the story  And, um  Told me not to say anything about it  And then I, uh  Sat on it for a little while 
[02:28:30]  But then proceeded to talk to other people  Who may or may not have known about it  And they verified everything is true  And I decided to go ahead with it anyway  Last August  Just to, um  Put it out there  Because it seemed like at this point  Jen would have told a lot of people  She didn't tell us  Because Ann was too busy flirting with her  Yeah, I heard you guys had her on  Yeah  Damn it  We could have got some scoop  What was she plugging?  The deli line at the time?  Is that what it was?  She was plugging  The Versus show 
[02:29:00]  It went nowhere  I'm sure it's a terrific show though  She's a talent to be reckoned with  I'll take the show out  Hey  I was  Did you think she was nice?  I don't mind  Did she seem nice on the phone?  Um, she's beautiful  But I got a weird vibe from her  What was the weird vibe?  I didn't like her  Why?  She didn't come across likable  Really?  To me  They loved her  I completely didn't get that  Yeah, I didn't like her  I thought she was nice  I thought she was okay  I thought she was nice  And hot as fuck  Hot as fuck? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, she really is  Yeah, I get mixed reviews on that too  Really?  Yeah  I mean, just  She's definitely hot  I can't fucking deny that  I'm sure  I don't have any doubt about it  But I mean, I think you know how  When people get scrutinized a little closer  Well, it is kind of  Yeah, they have been looking at her very closely  Yeah, I don't know  I mean, I thought I got an email from  Sent around to Sirius  With her photo in it  That was supposedly sent around your office  Right?  I mean  Oh  Wait, what?  Oh, really? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah  No, what was it?  No, it was  Jen in action with some dude  So  Or somebody that looked like her  But it said it came from you guys  I mean, that's what the email was  Wow, look at that  Wait, what is this about?  I'm very confused  Nothing at all  She was kissing a dude?  Kissing  Kissing  Kissing  Well, probably more than that  Yeah  Yeah  And it was happening in Sirius?  It was  But you guys never posted the picture?  No  No, never posted the picture 
[02:30:30]  But  Wait, I just got it like two days ago  And then  It was supposedly sent around the Sirius XM offices  Did we get lucky after the interview?  And you're not telling us?  No, I swear  Well, then it's got to be in someone's corporate email  Exactly  I'll forward it to you later  And then you can see if you had got it  And we're not sure it was her  Yeah  Are you talking about the photos of her felching me?  She's not felching you  No  She wanted no part of me  Felching  Where did you wind up getting photos and all that fun stuff? 
[02:31:00]  It was a third-party source  Third-party source  Yeah  Not allowed to reveal who that person was  I would never ask you to reveal your sources  That's fine  That's fine  Yeah  But  I mean, was it just somebody that said  Hey, you want these?  Yeah  Pretty much  I mean, that was  That was kind of the goal of going ahead with it anyway  Because I knew that there were other people out there  She had at least, you know, may have forwarded it to at some point  Yeah 
[02:31:30]  Did you get a little nervous?  Like, oh, fuck  If this isn't a ham  I don't want to go to court  No  I mean, we had five months to kind of work on that  And it was  You know, the story had made the round so much  That people were already kind of  There was enough circumstantial evidence  I'd heard the voicemails before  Everything kind of matched up  As far as we're concerned  That it was good to go  So, yeah, I felt pretty confident going into it  Is there any material that you have  That you hadn't printed or haven't printed yet?  In regards to that?  Yeah  Or just anything? 
[02:32:00]  Pretty much  There's a lot, yeah  Yeah?  But we just  Anything surprising?  No  There's nothing really that surprising  I mean, there was a lot of people from Green Bay  Who were kind of, you know  These bitter Packers fans at this point  Who were just unloading  Every single Brad Five story  Yeah, like  Yeah, here you go  Yeah  What was going on  Before the dick pictures were sent?  Like, was there a lot of texts that he had sent? 
[02:32:30]  Like, because we've been kind of hashing it about  How long you carry on a text discussion  Before you start sending parts of your body  Before you go to the next level  Yeah, yeah  You know, I mean, Brett Farr is not unique in that situation  Where he steps on that gas pedal a little quicker  I think you or I would  Yeah, there's a lot of athletes that just tend to go right there  It's like, yeah  After they meet somebody  Maybe like one night  Don't you think that Brett Favre thought it was time to send the dick picture, though? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, I think so  I mean, look  That's what confuses me  I mean, it seems like there was some kind of relationship going on  I use that word very loosely  But where he felt like, okay, I'm going to bump this up to a cockpit  Yeah, I mean, I think there was some probably some back and forth that gave him the impression that she was interested in something  But that's what AJ's saying  It's kind of like, you know, the sports guy's kind of a little quicker on the draw  But I understand what you're saying  But he did think something  He did lose his mind and go, I just got to send a dick picture out  You know, that's the thing also 
[02:33:30]  I mean, it could be that  Just because, I mean, a lot of these athletes have, you know, gotten everything they wanted since the young age  Ah, right  And, you know, just go right ahead  And go to places that I don't think you or I wouldn't have said  Was there any of her text messages to him?  We haven't seen any of those yet  But, I mean, I'm sure  I'm pretty positive that whatever she said back to him  She didn't say capital N, capital O at some point  Right  I would assume that there was some  That's what bothers me 
[02:34:00]  You only get the one side of all this shit  Right  All the time  Right  What did she send out?  Maybe no pictures, but maybe she LOL'd or something  I'm there, okay  Where someone might go, oh, now I understand why Brett Favre thought he could send  And there was a guy working for the Jets that was actually as kind of a liaison the whole entire time  So, I mean, whatever kind of conversation she was having with him  He's a dirty boy  Yeah, whomever gave him, you know, the go-ahead at that point  Did you have to pay for the photos?  Yeah  How much were they?  $12,000 
[02:34:30]  That's actually not that bad  No  That's easy  No, it worked out  Oh, yeah, I did actually hear that  I will usually wait until I get the text with at least five or six M's and an exclamation point  Yes  That means she's retarded  Young Frankenstein is saying  You made the yummy sound  The yummy sound  Wow, fuck, that was a huge scoop for you there, AJ  Yeah, it worked out  It continues to this day 
[02:35:00]  Do you think she was really bothered by the picture?  What you know?  Because it seems like you know more than what they're reporting  Well, I mean, in terms of bothered you, do I feel like  I don't think she thought she was a victim  Let's put it that way  I don't think there was any  Right  I don't know about the legal precedence of this  I mean, I'm not an attorney  But it's, in my impressions when talking to her  She was definitely kind of put off by the whole entire thing  But put off by the thing because he was Brett Favre  And she had, you know, the same impression as, like, I think most football fans do 
[02:35:30]  And was a little disappointed that he was going to that level with her a little quickly  But she also saw that this could get her name out there a little bit more now  I really don't think this was, you know, her being careerist  I mean, she's done stuff like that before  I mean, she's already done Maxim Playboy well before  This goes way above that  Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, again, you know, she did not necessarily give me  I mean, we were talking about this last February  And we were talking about, okay, well, why don't you come in, show us the pictures 
[02:36:00]  Show us the voicemails  And we'll try to keep your name out of it  And she, you know, went back and forth a little bit on that  Hesitated about that  And then was kind of concerned about  What is this going to do for her versus the Daily Line  Yeah  She'd just gotten that show  Gotcha  What are you working on now?  I hear there's something about some Ryder Cup guy  What is this?  Yeah, I'm not even sure  I mean, ever since Brett Favre happened, we've been getting offers for  Cockpicks?  Yeah  All the time  All the time 
[02:36:30]  Your Cockpick website  Exactly  You want it from Jim Norton?  We've all seen Jimmy's Cockpick  It's pretty impressive  Way more impressive than the Brett Favre display  I find this girl  Honestly, I don't know Jenster  We interviewed her once  Yeah  But I just, I really hate her  And I know I shouldn't  Because there's probably more to it  But I just from, again, a girl who  Not that a girl who takes those photos should be harassed  Right  But anybody in that world  Don't act like you don't understand the effect you have on people 
[02:37:00]  And don't pretend that you don't use that  To your, she'd be dumb to not use that to her advantage  She's a beautiful girl with a great body  So I don't believe that Brett Favre just went, hi, Cockpick  Of course not  I don't believe anybody does that  Of course not  And I mean, my big thing was like, after all this had happened  If she was, if she did feel, because I think the person that she felt violated by the most  Was us going ahead with that without, you know, her, you know, complete 100% permission to do this 
[02:37:30]  But if that were the case  But then why is she, sorry to interrupt  Then why is she passing the photo around?  Exactly  Did she pass it around?  She had complete control of this thing  And there were plenty of people who had heard those voicemails, seen those photos  And you're plenty of people  You did not get the photo from her, right?  No, not at all  So she sent it to somebody else that gave it to you guys  Whether she did that, hoping that you would end up having it  Yeah  Or maybe they had access to her phone  Somebody may have had access to her phone or computer too  Or maybe he sent the dick pic to somebody else also 
[02:38:00]  Sometimes you get a good angle, you save it so you can ship it out a few times  That wasn't a very good angle  I don't know, I mean, maybe for him it was  It looked like a nail he just pulled out  We're all in agreement that the penis looked sad, right?  Yeah  Yeah, that was not a good one  Yeah, what's the Ryder Cup guy about?  It's on your page today  Right  Yeah, yesterday afternoon somebody had sent and offered a picture of a Ryder Cup captain 
[02:38:30]  From the last few years  And I don't follow Goff that much either  Well, what's his name? I know Goff  Yeah, well, I mean, there's choices between Paul Azinger and Corey Pavin  Tom Watson, possibly  Well, Watson's an old guy, you would know if it's an old guy  Fred Favre's an old guy too, you know  Watson's 60, 61 maybe at this point  Maybe, you never know  Okay  Nothing surprises me  So it's one of those guys, is what this person is saying?  Yeah, and he was  And he, you know, had offered it up and said 
[02:39:00]  How much would something like this cost?  I gave him a price of around $221 just off the top of my head  And he said, you know, it's not going to be enough  And I said, $242  And it just went back and forth  And then I haven't heard from him since  Obviously there's no face in the picture  Yeah, I mean, I think he said something along the lines  You could tell who it is  And I don't know if that really gives any clues  And who was sent this picture?  Well, it's black, we know who it is 
[02:39:30]  He said it was a friend of his who was a girl  Who this person was trying to pick up one night  And, again, went straight to the naked pic  Fairly soon after  Do you think in a way, though, like  And I understand, like, it's competitive and online and stuff  But it's like, in a way, who cares if these guys are sending dick pictures  Isn't it kind of like a vulture mentality?  Like, we're just this country of, gotcha  It's like we just live to catch each other 
[02:40:00]  Doing shit like this  Like, if he's sending this dick picture  I don't understand the attraction or the appeal of it  I don't know why we give a fuck  I mean, the collective we, why we care  Did the Tiger Woods thing turn it all around, you think?  Because there seemed to be some unwritten, like, code  Between the athletes and who they were cheating with  Where they just kept it all on the QT, as we like to say  And then all of a sudden, now it seems like very into now, you know  With De La Hoya  Talk  Look what happened with De La Hoya 
[02:40:30]  Did it start with him, you think?  I don't know if it started with him, but don't forget in the last few years  Because these guys have been doing this since the start of fucking sports  The technology and stealing images and capturing things  He caught up, and also some of these  Snail mailing Polaroids of your dick  Right, right  Some fan that wrote you  Right  No, I think Tiger Woods completely had an impact on that  Which now all these women are thinking  Hey, I could fucking get my face out here  And maybe a payday, right?  Yeah, and I don't even know if it's necessarily a payday  But I mean, I think a lot of the times 
[02:41:00]  It's more these women are a little just stunned  At just, you know, how reckless these guys are  And these are guys that they, you know, seemingly know  And then take it to another level  Which makes them feel uncomfortable  And then, for some reason, they feel like  This is something they shouldn't be doing  But, you know, I mean  We're trying to kind of, I think at this point  Just at least move away from it  In some way  Just because  I don't know what else we can possibly do to top right  That's true 
[02:41:30]  What is the value  And again, if you didn't do it, somebody else would  It's not an attack on you  Because, again, I understand that  No problem  But my question is  Like, what is the value  Like, where is the story?  Like, Brett Favre said  It's on the news right there  Oh, dude, of course  It's going to be all over  Yeah, yeah  Oh, there's the massage  But what is it?  The guy sent his dick picture  To somebody else  Like, who gives a fuck?  I mean, I think the part that kind of separated  From normal dick photo sending to me  Was the fact that there was somebody  In the Jets organization  That was actually acting as almost like his pimp  And that's something where, I mean 
[02:42:00]  If you go into traditional journalism  That makes it a larger story  Than just something a little more  But you're not surprised by that, are you?  No, but at the same time  I would assume every team has one of those guys  I'm sure  I'm absolutely sure  I'm sure of that  But at the same time  It's just like, you know  The Jets  Yeah, we could have made some money  Me and Ann could have made money  Jets were really bad at this stuff  We've told this story many times  But there was a  We don't say his name anymore  But there was a Boston Celtics player  That got all his voicemails  Nice 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, we were able to call up his phone  And just like  Beep, bleep, bleep  Yeah, because there was a  Disruptible cell phone guy  That said, hey  You want something cool?  And he gave us all the codes  Get all those bitches from around the country  Whenever he was in a certain city  And there was a time  We would play his latest folk voicemails  On our show almost every day  Right  And no one was stopping us  Yeah  Remember that?  Yeah, it was great  I think we might have bleeped his name out back then  Yeah, we did  But he had bitches all over the country  Every fucking city  And they all thought  They were the only one  In their head 
[02:43:00]  I see you coming to L.A.  Yeah  I see you coming to Houston  I mean, you're a retired athlete  Same way  Yeah  I mean, it just  It happens  I mean, it's an absolute culture  That I don't think  Normal people can understand  What's the story here  With the Rex Ryan  The wife, the feet  Yeah, you guys broke that too  What's going on?  I don't know if you can  They broke that  We didn't break that  Yeah  I mean, that's the thing about this  I mean, this is not  Like a sex tape  Locked in their closet  I mean, they had  You know, foot shit 
[02:43:30]  All over the most popular website  On the planet  And YouTube  And  Now, why  Is there a lie to this?  It seems  It seems completely dumb  I mean, we happen to have a  Foot fetishist  I don't know if that's the proper term for it  But he's a reader of our site  And a football fan  And then  Was also following  My pretty feet  For apparently a long period of time  And, you know, once Rex Ryan got the Jets job  He's, you know, she started popping up a little bit  And he put two and two together 
[02:44:00]  And it turned out  I mean, she had all her personal info  On this site as well  Which was like  There was no disguise  I mean, she had her face out there  It wasn't just her feet  Yeah  And it was  It was not safe cracking  I mean, we did, you know  We kind of just matched up her birthday  To everything that was on the site  And she kept them all legit  All the time  That's a little different  Because they're actually in a public forum  And that's a bit different  Than Mel Gibson's phone calls  Yeah, definitely  But what's fucked up  They didn't want to hide  What they were up to  No, I mean, that's the thing 
[02:44:30]  I mean, they were looking for an audience  I mean, she had a lot of fans  And Rex Ryan was cool about it  Absolutely  And it turns out  That, I mean, that  He was participating  In a lot of these things  I mean, there was  You think they're swingers?  Yeah, I totally think they are  I totally think they are  I don't think there's any doubt  At this point  I mean, that was the thing  Where it kind of separated  It went from weird  And him role-playing with her feet  And pretending he's a cop  Or whatever that video was  Whatever that was  And then, just after that  Everybody that was on that  Alt.com website 
[02:45:00]  Where they were supposedly members  Started sending all this crazy shit  That was just, you know  Something that  I didn't really feel comfortable  Going there at this point  Because, I mean, right then  It was just like, okay  I don't want to watch Mrs. Ryan  Get her feet sniffed  By some random black dude  Because that's what the photos were  That was it  Just an odd thing  To want to have out there  I mean, they seem like  A very happily married couple  And, I mean  If that keeps it together  For them  Good for them  We love to 
[02:45:30]  We love to stare  At people's private shit  And then all you do  Is get phone calls  About people who complain  About airport security  My rights  My private  We don't give a fuck  About anybody's privacy  But our own  It's bizarre  And believe me  Dude, I've sent out pictures  Of my dick  There's so many  So I'm not being holier  I am a pervert  Like, I know  I've left myself open  If I was an athlete  I just don't understand  The appeal  Or the attraction to it  That people have  None of us ever  Step back and go  Nah, you know what 
[02:46:00]  That would humiliate me  It would probably humiliate them  I shouldn't  I mean, I think a lot of it  People feel like  They're being hypocritical  To what their public persona  Is supposed to be  I mean, a lot of these guys  With these huge endorsement deals  And present themselves as  Family-oriented  Really good guys  And then when they do  Something like this  You know, it's a crushing blow  To a lot of people  Which would  Which would be true  If all the people  Making the snap judgments  Weren't hypocrites themselves  Right  It's like if all the people  Who worked at the companies 
[02:46:30]  That are worried about  Losing their  Their consumer base  Or all of us in the public  We're all doing it  Like, that's what bothers me  It's not like  We're all good  And Brett Favre's  A piece of shit  We're all dirtbags  And we act like we're not  We act like we're not  I don't get it  I don't get this  Fucking morbid attraction  And if I decide  I would probably  Put it out there  I'm not being holier than that  I'm a weak man  Right  Hey  No, it's true  That's what the story is  We never think  That would humiliate me 
[02:47:00]  I shouldn't do it  None of us ever think that  Right, right  We're talking to AJ  From Deadspin.com  Now, what's the website about  For the people that don't know  The newbies?  Deadspin is  The best way to describe it  Is probably alternative sports news  And gossip  You know, we do  A little bit of  We don't really do game stories  I mean  And we cover a lot of  Hence why you didn't know about hockey  Yeah, exactly  I don't mind  But, yeah  And that's pretty much what it is  I mean  And we have, you know  Dick photos 
[02:47:30]  And that much more  How did you get started?  Had you had sites before?  Not really  No, I started in the newspaper industry  And I was a serialized writer  And then started working for Gawker  Who owned Deadspin  Around five years ago  Okay  Gawker, yeah  I love that one  And then just kind of got lucky  With this one  A couple of good hits  As far as stories go  Yeah, I mean  It was going well before  And then something like this 
[02:48:00]  I mean, you really have no control over  I mean, this is  You know  One story turns into  A cultural phenomenon  That lasts four months  I mean  It's not going to happen again  Are you able to monetize this thing?  Not really  No?  No  It's one of those things  Yeah, I mean  Laboral love, right?  Pretty much  Pretty much  What are you working on now?  We always  What's on the site right now?  I have no idea  I haven't seen the site this morning  He's just like  Whatever  I'm doing radio  Are you Dave Thomas?  You don't actually make the burgers 
[02:48:30]  Jim Cook  Jim Cook  Jim Cook didn't know shit about beer  He knows about beer  He was just like  Nah, he did  I don't think he was  Pawing through the books over there  No, not at all  He's too busy going on vacations  And taking shock jocks with him  Too inside  Sorry, AJ  No problem  Yeah, what's some of the big things  You guys are working on?  I mean  We've been working on this story  For around a year and a half  Where we were trying to figure out  Actually how Magic Johnson got AIDS 
[02:49:00]  Because, I mean  There's  You know  We had  I'll get two guesses  It was probably one of two ways  I mean  A needle or a dick  Had to be, right?  Well, I mean  The big rumor that's out there  Was the fact that  Apparently Magic Johnson  And Arsenio Hall  And Eddie Murphy  Used to go to these  Tranny parties  At Eddie Murphy's house  God, I wish I knew  Eddie Murphy back then  What great fun  They would have had  Yeah  And apparently  There was something that happened  Along those lines 
[02:49:30]  And there's  Certain other Lakers players  Who have been  Sworn to silence  About what exactly happened  But I mean  That's something that's  Been out there for a while  And we're trying to just  Like, you know  Track down some people  Who are actually at the party  Or may have seen  I don't know  Magic have sex  With a transsexual  At some point  But, you know  I think that's  It's one of those things  That I think is a good story  For us  In the sense that this is  You know  I mean  That's a story that  Pretty much made  You know  Heterosexual men  Kind of fear for their life  Afterwards 
[02:50:00]  And if it's something  That actually wasn't  I mean  That's something  That should be out there  Are you saying  That sex with a tranny  Isn't heterosexual  I have to take issue  Yeah, Jimmy definitely  Has to take issue  On that one  I don't want to see  The tranny community  Do you really think  Heterosexual men  Really thought that  He got it from  Heterosexual sex though  Yeah, absolutely  I mean  When I heard that  I'm like  Alright  Magic's doing something  In my humble opinion  I'm like  Some shenanigans  Yeah, what is he doing 
[02:50:30]  I never thought  That he got it  From a woman  No  Ever  It scared the crap  Out of me  Really  I was 16 at the time  And I was young too  Because that goes  Way back at this point  Yeah  I didn't think twice about it  I said  This guy's up to something  Whether his drugs  Are a little  A little fucking  I mean  I think  It was obviously  Not the same  Media landscape  As it was now  But  Remember  This is something  The president got behind  There was something  That  Magic Johnson  Was basically  Now the new face  Of age  And was supposed 
[02:51:00]  To be out there  To prove that  Okay, yeah  All I'm saying is  I didn't buy into  Any of that shit  Well, good for you  I was nice  Did you buy into  Jimmy?  Ant?  I figured he was  Doing something  But I would have  Thought more needles  But, you know  Again, nothing  Surprised me  If he was taking it  In the ass  It doesn't surprise me  If he had a cut  On his dick  And fucked a hooker  Who had it  Nothing would have  Surprised me  I just thought  He was fucking  A lot of women  So you thought  He could have got it  From a lot of women  And got it that way  Maybe some women  Kind of, you know  Questionable 
[02:51:30]  Ethics  But he has that  He has that thing  When he talks  Though  You think  If you heard  If I heard  That Magic  Liked Dick  As well  It wouldn't surprise me  I mean  It wouldn't  Yeah  I mean  When he talks  You'd be like  Oh yeah  I can see that  On the DL  You think  Yeah  It happened before  Yeah  Yeah  Well look at  Isaiah Thomas  There's a picture  Of Magic kissing him  Did Isaiah not want  To play with him  Because of the AIDS  In the US  That's Carl Malone  Oh is that Malone? 
[02:52:00]  Was it Malone?  Well he looks like shit now  He looks worse  Than Magic Johnson  He does  And he played  A lot longer  Than Magic Johnson  That's true  They just  There was a commercial  That was on TV  Just very recently  Right where he's all fat  Right  Fucking looks horrendous  I don't know  If Danny can find it  I can't believe  It's the same guy  And Magic looks like  He could play still  So who won that battle?  Well I wouldn't worry  About Magic  Putting on a lot of weight  I kept his weight  Pretty much the same  He ballooned up  He bulked up  20 pounds  Yeah  I think he's actually  Gained weight 
[02:52:30]  Since the AIDS  I heard he stopped  Taking his medication  Like thinking he was cured  And then it started  To progress again  And then he had to  Keep taking the medicine  Oh really?  That's what I heard  Like he's fine  As long as he takes  The cocktail  Or whatever it is  Yeah  Please ask about  Don Mattingly's ex-wife  Okay  That's a question  For you AJ  I don't know what that means  Maybe it means something  Maybe it means nothing  Yeah I don't know  I don't know exactly  What's that referencing to  What happened to Don Mattingly?  Can the guy  What does he want?  Ask what about her? 
[02:53:00]  Is she from Indiana too?  Yeah  What do we ask?  Alright it's another dead end  No surprise here  What about  What about the sports story?  Who's that boxer  That was yelling  At his security guy  At his housing complex?  Mayweather probably  Oh that was Mayweather  Yeah  Did you see that clip?  It's like  Let me in my fucking house  Let me in my fucking house  Yeah he's had a rough year  Floyd Mayweather  I guess it was  He's in a gated community 
[02:53:30]  And they wouldn't let him in?  And they wouldn't let him in  And he  He was a little pissed off  Because  I guess there's  A family  In the same community  That he saw  Go in without  Any question whatsoever  He may have thought  Race came into play  Did he have a  Domestic violence incident too  Or some kind of  Domestic incident?  I think so  I think he punched  A security guard  At that same gate house  It was a security guard  But I think there was something  With a girlfriend  Baby mama  Type situation  A little before that  Oopsie 
[02:54:00]  I mean what do you guys  Think is going to happen  If the Jets actually  Make the Superbowl?  I mean that's going to be  The most awkward  Pre-game telecast ever  Why?  Because they're going to  Have to bring up  All this shit that  Happened on this year  They just don't though  What do you mean  They just don't?  The sports announcers  Make believe none of this shit  Is going on  And if they do talk about it  It's very many  If they make the Superbowl  If the Jets make the Superbowl  More importantly  If Mike  Yeah Michael Vick  Makes the Superbowl  That's a much bigger  Fucking story  Okay no but they've done that 
[02:54:30]  What about the advertisers  Like oh fuck  Now we're advertising  In the Superbowl  When this guy did what he did  You're telling me  Everything that's happened  With the Jets  In terms of being  A public relations nightmare  This year  Is not going to be brought up  I'm a big Jets fan  And they barely talk  About this stuff  Barely  And it's very vague  They're scared  Who?  Just the announcers  In general  Well I mean  Not the  I'm saying  If they're going to have  A big huge Superbowl build up  Where they're going to have  Sit downs with the coach  Right  Sit downs  With the owner 
[02:55:00]  You know  This is the type of stuff  That is  You can't ignore  I mean this is  They're going to talk about  Their season  Right  And they're going to talk about  What happened at the beginning  Of the season  What happened with  Inez Sainz  What happened with  You know  The strength coach  Tripping the guy on the sidelines  What happened with  Brett Farr  They'll certainly talk about  The tripping incident  What happened with  You and your wife's feet  They'll have softball questions  Yeah they'll try to mention it  They really will  They feel too silly  When the guy goes  That's a personal matter  It's almost like  That's a dead end  For those guys 
[02:55:30]  They would have to just go  I know it's a personal matter  But I want to talk about it  Players and coaches  Get out of shit like that  Because the announcer  Looks petty and stupid  If he harps on something  That's non-sports oriented  Well I mean  Anything family oriented  Is technically a personal matter  I mean they'll talk about  You know  Good stuff  I mean  I agree  I mean they'll show his wife  Flipping eggs or something like that  In our home  So  Why wouldn't they talk about  Her fucking feet  They probably will try to bring it up  But it will go nowhere  Yeah 
[02:56:00]  Is your answer  Unfortunately  For the same reason  Those reporters  Don't give any information  About themselves  Yeah  Those sports announcers  Would talk about their wife's pussy  Or feet  Yeah  You know what I mean  I would love it  If they asked Rex Ryan  He goes  Tell me something about your wife  And I'll tell you about mine  And the guy did  How great would that be  Are they trade stories  That'd be phenomenal  I just wonder if advertisers  Will advertise with the Super Bowl  If Michael Vick makes it  Fuck  Yeah  Because that's really confusing  For a lot of people  There's a lot of people  That still are not over  The Michael Vick thing  But a lot of those people  Aren't sports fans 
[02:56:30]  I mean that's the thing  But now you got him playing  In the Super Bowl  Which is  They try to make him this  Make into this wholesome  Family event now  And you got  The dog killer  Apology special  And it'll be fine  Have you already done it  Every single time  He's played home  And he's paid his death  He went to jail  I agree with all that  But there's a lot of people  That certainly aren't over it  And you know  The corporate guys  You know  I think they got a  They got a little situation there  Roman Polanski was playing  That advertises  Just too many fucking people watching  Too many people  Which shows how hypocritical 
[02:57:00]  Those assholes are  They are all jizz bags  And it's like  I kind of like  I want to know about these stories  In a way  And then a part of me  Is like  You know what  The reporters  And those people  Offer nothing about them  It's almost like  If you're not giving  Full disclosure about yourself  Don't fucking expect it  From everybody else  Yeah  If you're giving it  About yourself  Then you can ask anybody  Whatever you want  Right  But if these guys  That fucking  Are closed off  About their own lives  And would feel violated  If anything about their wife  Was brought up  Those are the guys  That are kind of irritating  Did you guys talk about  The Brock Lesnar 
[02:57:30]  Undertaker thing?  No  Not at all  You didn't get any  Insight scoop on that?

[02:59:30]  Huckleberry Finn  It's a classic  A lot of us have read that book  Yes  This is rough man  Knowing how the world should be  It's just rough 
[03:00:00]  It's political correctness  Has gone crazy at this point  Yeah it's rough  How far they're taking  Some of this shit  I don't even think  They should be taking it  Anywhere  But they are  And they're going  Way too fucking far  The new edition  Of Huckleberry Finn  Will remove all instances  Of the N-word  And replace it with slave  The N-word  Is getting taken out  Yes  And they will replace it  With slave  So he won't be  Nigger Jim  He's just going to be  Oh I thought they were  Adding slave in front 
[03:00:30]  To make it a harsher name  Slave Nigger Jim  They're updating it  They're like  We really want to  Drive the point home  That would be harsh  Imagine if they came out  So they were doing that  And we're putting  LOL after it  We've decided to do that  LOL  To update it a little more  Just to make it hip  For the kids  Make the kids understand  Yes we're going to write  Nigger Jim  But then put a winky face  Like a friendly text message  Why don't they just  Change it to the  N-I-G-G-A version  That's acceptable  That too 
[03:01:00]  You can update it like that  That's acceptable though  Put that in Twitter  You'll have a ball  Reading the tweets  Well they've changed it  They've updated it  His name is now going to be  Talks loud in movie theaters  Jim  This is ridiculous  Is this a Mark Twain story right  Yeah  So Mark Twain was able to say  Okay this is fine  You can do this to my fucking masterpiece  I don't think so  Exactly  So who gave the okay  The book company  Who's probably not selling books 
[03:01:30]  Because nobody is buying textbooks  With nigger Jim in them  It's probably a financial decision  I don't think it has anything to do  With the fact that no one's buying it  With  For language purposes  You can't change it  I just don't think anybody's  Reading that book anymore  Okay maybe  But you can't  You can't change people's shit  No no no  When Mark Twain wrote it and stuff  It was completely fine  And it  It was what it was  And that's it  If you want to write a new book 
[03:02:00]  Where you don't have that word in it  Then go ahead  Do it  But don't fucking change  Someone's masterpiece  There's no reason to take  Language out of a book  I mean  It's  It's the guy's words  It's what he wrote  What are they going to change it to n-word  N-word  As in n-word right  No they're just  Changing him to slave Jim  Slave Jim  He's slave Jim now  To give you really  What do you think Mark Twain would have thought  I don't know because  He'd be like  Why am I still alive  Yeah I'm old  So old  Wow 
[03:02:30]  Could God take me before  Zha Zha please  A what president  Right  It's hard to say  Have most  Words  Gone through the  Like  Have  Nigger's a weird word  Like in that  It's unique  Like that  Like he didn't write  Any profanity in the book  Like he didn't write  Anything in that book  Like cunt  Or fuck  Or um  I stuck my dick in her  I jerk  He didn't write anything  That would have been  Deemed offensive  At that time 
[03:03:00]  Yes  Oh really  And it's rare  That a word  Like  Very few words  Have the implication  That nigger does  Like  So like here  It was a hundred and something  Years later  Right  That's a really  When you  Think of it  Common sense wise  You sell books  And a classroom  Reads that  And it is  2011  And a teacher  Is sitting there  Going okay  And then nigger  Jim  It just  It's not gonna happen  In a classroom now  But it  I think it should  Because it just  Shows what 
[03:03:30]  A certain time was  It's put in  Put it in the context  Of when the book  Was written  Not in the context  Of now  If you're reading  The book  You're probably  Studying  Literary history  Things like that  Um  And  And to change that  Changes the whole  Idea of  Educating yourself  On what things were  And history  And uh  How  How  How words were used  Back then  As opposed to 
[03:04:00]  How they are now  Yeah then you could  Have an open discussion  Yeah  How times have changed  It  It  It  It  It  It was in context  Then  Then they probably  Then they just won't  Use it in classrooms  Like that  I mean I could care less  What they do  There's a million  Fucking books  They could read  In class  I just go to  A certain website  It's all over it  I don't need that  God damn book  Slave mania  Yes  I go to  Slave  Slavemania.com  Slave mania  Slave mania  Slave mania  Slave mania  Slave mania  Oh jeez  Fucking asshole  That's perfect though  Yeah  That's exactly where I go 
[03:04:30]  I just don't think  I don't think it helps anyone  To change history like that  I think  Yeah  I think you gotta get better teachers  That are able to discuss  Well this is uh  This was very acceptable  When this book was written  And obviously  It's not so acceptable today  Let's discuss this uh  Children  Yes  Let's have an open discussion  Why do that  Why discuss shit  You know what though  No  Let's have an open discussion  So I could be suspended  True  And or fired  True  And parents can complain  And uh  The news will come here 
[03:05:00]  And blow it out of proportion  So even that  Not even to make it  An open discussion  But how about  Just for honesty's sake  This is what the book was  This is how it was written  Let's look  And it was written  Take it in context  And leave it  Just leave it the fuck alone  If you wanna read it  That's right  You read it  If you don't  You don't  Or just make it available  I don't see any value  To reading this  For students  Either they change  Or not  You know  I really  Yeah but leave the fucking book alone 
[03:05:30]  And get another book  And it's a classic book  And it's nothing  That they can't get  Eight billion times worse  Just downloading something  Off the fucking iTunes  I really do think  I really do think though  By the way  That it's a financial decision  I really  Sure because it's being removed  By New South books  They're the ones  That make the book  They have an interest  In selling them  So it's like  They're not gonna  No classroom  New South  That's what they're called  Oh okay  That sounds like  An agenda in the name  Oh yeah  No one is gonna buy them 
[03:06:00]  With nigger Jim in them  The classrooms just won't  Even though it is  Kind of repulsive  Yeah  They won't buy them  So they're like  Alright do we wanna just  Eat it and not make any money  Or if we take this out  Maybe we'll be able  To sell them and make money  And it goes back  To a point Ant made years ago  You know now  They're gonna have to  Change it in every  Fucking book  Oh right  And it doesn't stop  With the one word  It's gonna be all  The other words  That were  Yeah sanitized  Horribly offensive  Or words that are  Horribly offensive  To some people now  We gotta get rid  Of all those words  In all the books  Ever fucking written 
[03:06:30]  Yep  It doesn't ever end  With just this one  Fucking book  And that's why  You gotta fight this shit  That's why  It will never  Be taken out of  The Anthony Cumia  Driving home book  Because that is  Very important  Which is about to happen  That is a very important  Word  Dog shit sniffer  They're changing  Moby Dick  It's now gonna be  Called Moby Junk  Yeah  One of the classics  Yes  And  Oh  Sarah from Buffalo  She's a regular  She writes 
[03:07:00]  There's a twain expert  Who said  The language  Has to be updated  That's why  It's being changed  Why does the language  No it doesn't  You don't update  It's a book  It's a fucking book  And then  Take the wig  He goes  Mark Twain would have  Heated it  He was a  Career writer  Dedicated to the  Power of language  Mark Twain would have  Despised this  He hated the compulsions  Of the western world  Just read  The Innocents  Abroad  Abroad  If they want to  Update a book  How about the bible  How about they 
[03:07:30]  Win and fucking  Make a few changes  In that  Wow  Imagine the fucking  Uproar  But I mean why not  There's some pretty  Nasty stuff in there  Sure  There's violence in there  There's things that have  Been proven historically  Inaccurate  There's some smiting  Going on  Smiting  People being smited  Why not go in there  And change that  And why are they  Going with slave gym  Wouldn't that be  Pretty damn offensive  To a lot of people too  Well slave is not  A racially based word  Yeah I understand  I understand what they're  Yeah  Hey of course  Family Guy did a little  Something on this  A few years back  Oh yeah  You've never heard this
