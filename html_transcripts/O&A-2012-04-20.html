<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, featuring Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine in studio, but notably absent Jim Norton (supposedly at a wedding), was themed around a "Fuck Around Day." The show began with a graphic account of one host's defecation on a beach during vacation, prompting jokes about the logistics and potential consequences.  This segued into a running debate about Kelly's "Go Runner" bandolier/fanny pack, its masculinity questioned, and its contents ridiculed.  A "fat jar" was introduced, fueled by repeated violations of a self-imposed "no fat jokes" rule.  Many fat jokes were made, adding to the chaotic energy.  The hosts recounted an excruciatingly awkward interview with UFC fighter Rashad Evans, focusing on rumors about Evans's wife and Jon Jones.  Video footage of Jones physically assaulting Florentine was also discussed.  Further anecdotes included Norton's experience at a poorly-organized suicide benefit show with an uncomfortable Mormon comedian, Nortonâ€™s experiences at a club in Ocean City, Maryland, and criticisms of celebrity hairpieces.  Tangents included discussions of gym etiquette, public defecation (a lake and water slide were mentioned),  the UFC fight between Evans and Jones, and a debate about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, mentioning artists like Elvis Costello, Warren Zevon, and Guns N' Roses. The death of the Men at Work saxophonist was also noted.  A prolonged comedic bit involved sexually suggestive children's rhymes played during a commercial break.  The show also featured a discussion about dry humping, spurred by a fat joke leading to a $5 bet, and included anecdotes about the hosts' experiences and preferred underwear for such activities.  Bobby displayed childhood photos, including a controversial tutu picture, generating debate about its authenticity and prompting a planned tweet with a listener poll comparing the "gayness" of Bobby's bandolier and a woman's bag.  The show concluded with further discussion of the host's musical knowledge and a potential upcoming guest appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Today is Fuck Around Day on The Opie and Anthony Show.  I got Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine today.  Anthony, is Anthony at a wedding?  Sam?  I don't know where he's at.  He gave the excuse he had to go to a wedding. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  Is he at a wedding?  He's not the one, he's not the type to lie.  I don't care either way, I just want to know.  Is he at a wedding?  He won't answer the question.  Why won't you answer the question?  Well, he's probably not at a wedding right now at 6 o'clock in the morning.  I love blowing up everyone's shit, so blow up Anthony's shit today.  Well, there's a lot of weddings on Fridays.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't been to one.  He might be at a wedding.  He's probably at a wedding.  Whatever, he's got his days, he can do whatever the fuck he wants.  Why would he lie to us?  Why would he lie to us, exactly.  Wedding?  So, Anthony's at a wedding.  Everybody's got friends to get married. 
[00:02:00]  Anthony doesn't go to weddings.  So when he told me he was going to a wedding, I'm like, okay, enjoy your day off, have fun.  He doesn't go to weddings.  He barely went to mine.  He went to half a bike.  He doesn't go to weddings, okay?  And Jimmy's in where?  Cincinnati.  Yeah.  Doing something down there.  The funny bone.  The funny bone.  Thank you.  So, sitting in, we've got Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine.  And the reason is because the bosses around here told me I should work. 
[00:02:30]  They told me I should work.  It's good to work.  Yeah, so I get to hang out with you guys.  There you go.  Oh.  And Bobby started off by telling me how uncomfortable he was during the Rashad Evans interview.  He's just a jackass.  Why, though?  I've got to make it interesting.  It's not interesting if everybody gets killed in the room.  Hey, did we film the whole interview?  Yeah.  Oh, we've got to get the video up of when I asked that question, then.  Yeah, we had that.  Oh, let's do that.  Okay. 
[00:03:00]  I mean, it's great that I got video of Rashad Evans punching Jimmy twice.  But what Bobby's about to say, that would be a good video as well.  He got hit.  Did Jimmy get hit again?  Oh, yeah.  Here it is.  Right here.  How would you do?  There you go.  Oh!  Would he take that punch?  Oh, man!  I would take it.  He's better to get him when I'm not ready.  It should be on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, right, Erock?  What's the first thing that goes through your mind?  He took two hits. 
[00:03:30]  Well, is anybody going to look into why Jimmy likes this?  We're trying.  We're trying because he really enjoys it.  Because he took two punches, one in the right arm, one in the left arm from Rashad Evans.  And then he wanted more.  Yeah.  Like, he was hinting he was going to take a blow to the chest.  And we're like, you have a comedy special soon.  You don't need a cracked sternum before you go to Cleveland.  Yeah, there's something he likes.  And he's got bruises the next day, I'm sure, right?  Yeah, but you know what?  We forgot to check on the bruises.  But I'm sure, because when Jon Jones punched him. 
[00:04:00]  Jon Jones kicked him in, when he punched him, but before that he kicked him in the upper thigh.  Yeah.  With a shin kick, but really hurt him.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, this guy didn't know his own strength.  And if you watch the video, it's uncomfortable to watch.  You know what?  I'm going to repost all those videos, because we got the big fight tomorrow night.  Rashad Evans and Jon Jones.  But honestly, the best one, because Jon Jones has done, I think, three videos for us now,  but the best one was when he choked you out. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  He took me out.  And he held the choke a little longer than maybe he should have.  And a lot of people are calling him an asshole for that.  Can you repost that on our Facebook page?  E-Rock, Opie and Anthony.  Reposting right now.  What did it feel like?  It just, I...  Right here.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, Bobby!  Bobby fell over and had to be held up by two gentlemen. 
[00:05:00]  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Chuck!  Chuck Jones is sick!  Did you feel that?  It wasn't me.  He literally almost killed me.  It wasn't me?  That's what it is.  You're choking me out until I almost die.  Right.  The lights went out.  They did, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They faded out.  They were starting to fade.  Yeah, but I panicked me.  Right when he started choking me, I heard cracking in my neck.  Really?  I thought he was breaking my spinal cord.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  He was just popping my head off, so I panicked, and I forgot to tap.  And then I saw the lights dimming.  Right.  So then I was like, okay.  And I started tapping, but it was too late.  He decided to go on a little longer, and then the lights just went out.  Well, he kept choking you, even though you probably tapped close to 20 times, because  it was like a hummingbird.  You were tapping like a hummingbird.  Yeah, and it got lighter and lighter.  You hear?  It was like, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  And then when he let go, I mean, you didn't have enough oxygen to continue standing.  I don't have enough oxygen to continue sitting right now. 
[00:06:00]  Never mind fucking having the light heavyweight champ choking me out.  I've decided no fat jokes today.  Hey, no fat joke day.  You're doing me a favor.  No fat jokes.  Wow.  That's nice.  That's great.  I love it.  That was nice, right?  That's great.  I can't guarantee the listeners aren't going to throw one or two.  Is that how it goes?  Is that how it goes?  Jesus Christ.  No phone calls today?  We go, no fat jokes, no phone calls today.  Sounds fantastic.  And we can turn off our Twitters and just hang like old school. 
[00:06:30]  Old school.  I'm in.  I'm out.  My phone's out.  I don't know if I can live without the Twitter.  Are you shitting me?  It doesn't happen in your social life.  Are you shitting me?  I don't know.  Are you doing it here?  What are you, a girl comic?  Why?  They're on Twitter a lot.  Oh, nice.  You know?  The girls are?  I was at Nikki Glaser last night.  Hilarious comedian.  Yeah, she's great.  We drove back from Ocean City, Maryland.  We did a suicide benefit.  Yeah, I saw you tweeting about that.  That was fucking it.  What, someone made a suicide joke, though?  The guy who hosts it, the guy who puts it all together.  One of Voss's friends, of course. 
[00:07:00]  Really?  He's known Voss for years, yeah.  Yeah, it's in this room.  Who is it?  This guy, Dave.  I forget his last name.  Funny guy?  I don't know if he's even a comic.  I don't know what he...  He's a...  He catches fruit in his mouth.  What?  What?  He can throw...  This is his...  He throws fruit in the air.  Why hasn't he made it?  At crazy heights.  Like 100 feet in the air and catches it.  What about jokes, though?  Well, he opened up the suicide benefit last night.  Yeah, we're here for a suicide benefit. 
[00:07:30]  I don't know, man.  I think about killing myself three times a frigging day.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Nothing.  Yeah, because I've done this before, this benefit, too.  And, you know, this is a lot of families that have lost people and stuff like that.  Right.  And they're trying to maybe forget about that part of it.  And they go, you know, to support and they're paying $25 for a ticket, you know.  And he brings two ladies up that both lost kids, which is tragic.  One gives the other one a gift, and she's just bawling.  This other stuff.  And then you're going to be funny after that?  Yeah, then he brings up...  How do you guys do this?  Then he brings up Ryan Hamilton, who's a Mormon comic. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Total crystal clean.  Right.  And he's going to go up, and he took a nice hot one for, like, five minutes.  His voice just kept getting higher and higher, and he turned into, like...  Like a high-pitched Jerry Seinfeld.  He's like, where are we?  What the hell's going on here?  What the hell?  Was he panicking?  He started panicking.  Really?  I started panicking.  Were you next after that?  No, Glazer was next.  Yeah.  She went up.  You know, she didn't give a shit.  She went up and just did her... 
[00:08:30]  She's got some pretty atrocious funny jokes, man.  Right.  Some rough jokes.  She went up and killed it.  Yeah.  But...  And then you did all right?  Yeah, I did fine.  I didn't give a fuck.  By that time, it was all right.  And it's in a bar, too, so it's not a great atmosphere for comedy.  For comedy.  It's not just a bar.  It's this fucking mega bar.  Right.  It's called Secrets Nightclub.  Right.  This guy started out with a little tiny bar.  Now it holds 5,000 people.  Oh, Jesus.  And it has its own radio station.  Really?  Yeah.  It's not a bad idea.  They rip out... 
[00:09:00]  I'm going to need a job in October.  Maybe I'll look there.  You think?  They rip out the palm trees.  They rip out the palm trees.  They have all real palm trees.  They spend over half a million dollars on palm trees.  Inside palm trees?  Inside, outside.  They take...  They're real palm trees.  They rip them all out every year and replace them with new palm trees.  Wow.  It's right on the bay, and it's Ocean City, Maryland.  It's a cool place.  Is it nice down there?  Yeah.  It's beautiful.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll summer down there this summer.  It's fucking beautiful. 
[00:09:30]  I was going to ask you.  Oh, so why don't the suicide people just go bowling or something?  Why are they...  No, I'm serious.  It's a different way to...  I've done a bunch of them before.  It's a different way to just raise money for...  Usually you don't go up there and do those kind of jokes, but that guy...  When I did it, he went up for like five minutes, and then I did...  It was only me and him.  Yeah.  And then I had to do like an hour and 15 minutes.  Wow.  So, yeah.  So, it was rough, but...  I did an hour last night, but after they warmed up, they were fine, though. 
[00:10:00]  They were fine.  After the old ladies and the people who knew this is...  They left.  Like, I go up, and all of a sudden, the old people, they just started taking off.  Oh, really?  Refilled with dudes, and then it was fine.  You can say whatever you want.  All right.  Yeah, it was fine, but...  Back to the Rashad Evans thing.  Yeah, dude.  So, you were telling me you got uncomfortable in the car when we were talking to him?  Yeah, because you brought up...  Here's the thing, is you brought up...  I know it's going to go south when you go, should I ask this? 
[00:10:30]  No, I shouldn't.  Maybe I shouldn't.  Well, that was my way to do it.  You know that, right?  Yeah, it's your little trick.  That was calculated, because then he looks at me, and he goes, what?  I go, I don't know.  He goes, no, say it.  I'm like, all right, you told me to say it.  The guy...  Let me just set this up for you, Jim.  The guy he's fighting, they were friends in the same camp, and now the guy he's fighting...  Now, Rashad was the light heavyweight champ, lost it.  Now, he's fighting his friend, who's the light heavyweight champ.  They had a falling out.  His coaches all went with the new guy.  So he got a divorce, everything's all messed up, he's coming back in his life, he's fighting 
[00:11:00]  his ex-friend, they hate each other now.  The kid's like 20, was he 25?  He's the youngest heavyweight champ ever.  And this fucking jackass has him in here.  We all have him in here.  And here's the worst part, it's fight week.  This guy hasn't eaten right in months.  He's been training for months.  Fight week is the...  They're fucking miserable.  They're cutting weight.  No sex.  No, nothing.  It's just, they're fucking miserable. 
[00:11:30]  They're ready to kill somebody.  They've been wound so tight, they're just gonna shut that cage and go fucking kill somebody.  I'd rather talk to these guys after they fight.  He's so right.  You could just see it in their eyes.  Yeah, it's just not the same person.  They don't want carbs.  You know how miserable you are when you're not eating.  They want just raw meat.  Every time, but can I just say, I know we're not doing fat jokes today, but as soon as somebody  says a good fat joke, and I know where the opening is, I get nervous.  I just got nervous.  That could have led to a fat joke right there.  I'm sorry for Jimmy. 
[00:12:00]  You're lucky he wasn't here.  We would have broken our rule already.  This guy.  I'm gonna try, though.  You watch.  You might be proud of me.  Now it's a try?  Yeah, you might be proud of me.  Huh?  By 10 o'clock.  You, uh...  He goes like this.  He goes, can I ask you something?  One of the listeners, ah, maybe I shouldn't.  And I'm like, oh, God.  And he goes, no, no, no.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I go, I don't know.  And he goes, ah, well, one of the listeners, first of all, he throws a listener under the  bus.  This fucking, whoever, Dave from fucking Shitville, that was probably fake. 
[00:12:30]  But yeah, probably, yeah, because it's coming from a listener.  Look, this is what this guy said.  I didn't say it.  I'm just asking.  And I just, I've never heard of this before, but he's just wondering.  He probably has a notepad with that written in it from last night.  See, you got nervous in a cab.  I saw Norton's face.  Norton's eyes went really big, because he's literally six inches from Rashad Evans.  He's, I mean, for some reason, Jimmy likes to sit almost shoulder to shoulder with the  guests.  Yeah.  So his eyes got really big.  Like, oh, fuck, no. 
[00:13:00]  Please, not today.  You can't forget these guys are fighters.  Like, these guys hurt people forever.  They're fighters.  Yeah, they can come in a room and make people laugh and have fun like everybody else, but  his objective is to beat the fuck out of somebody.  Rule one, most of his brain is focused on hurting people all the time.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  They just tamed him a little bit, you know, with money and houses and cars and shit.  This guy goes, there's a rumor going around that maybe, and he fucking slow draws it, 
[00:13:30]  too, which was more uncomfortable.  Because then I wasn't sure.  I wasn't sure.  Because maybe that John, you got divorced recently.  And maybe that because John Jones maybe had, was with your wife, you know, was...  Oh, man.  E-Rock might have the audio.  It's so fucking uncomfortable.  And this guy, you could hear the second of silence that this guy's trying to grab a hold  of his sanity. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And not jump across this fucking table and grab this toe head by his fucking neck.  Is it a long clip?  E-Rock.  I have a short clip of you asking and it being uncomfortable, but we can keep going if you  want to hear his answer after that.  Oh, yeah.  Of course we want to hear the answer.  Yeah, I want to hear the answer.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Rashad Evans from a couple days ago.  What guy?  What?  I want to put people feeding you questions.  Saying, yeah, you ask.  There's a guy...  No, I'm not asking Rashad Evans fight week about a rumor. 
[00:14:30]  No.  What's the rumor?  Seriously?  Pause.  Pause.  There's not a man alive that would go...  Don't worry about it.  You have to know at that point.  You just have to know.  Right?  You go, seriously?  You totally...  You put everything on him.  He fell for it.  He made it kind of easy at that point.  He kind of made it easy.  I'm like, I don't know.  Really?  All right.  Well...  See, I would have just said, yeah, you know, you know what I'm going to ask you. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  Like, my girl will go, you know, I hate to bring this up.  I go, then don't.  And then I just leave it like that.  Right.  And then I just walk away.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Even that.  At that point, I would have to know.  I've done radio interviews before.  I go, I don't want to ask you this.  I'm like, all right, then don't.  All right, so what's next?  Oh, you're good, then.  Oh, yeah, I'll do that.  Yeah.  Most people, as soon as you say that, you have to know, right?  Florentine's an old school man.  He is.  He's not like...  He's an old...  He reminds me of my grandfather, the greatest generation.  You know what I mean?  I don't want to...  Well, don't. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, then don't.  It's either that or he has some stuff.  He's like, oh, God, I don't think anyone knew about that one.  No, I don't...  There might be a chance, so maybe I should just cut this off now.  I've said everything I've done.  He's an old school man.  I've got nothing to hide.  Nothing to hide.  I've got nothing to hide.  I've still got a fucking BlackBerry, and I don't have a fucking gay belt that Robert Kelly's  walking around with.  Trust me, we're going to get into the bag thing.  It's a bandolier.  A bandolier.  Shush.  We're going to get into the bandolier thing.  He might have brought one in for me. 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  And Florentine might have a purse.  I'm just saying, we might.  We don't know yet.  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  Let's save it, then.  We're going to save it, because we're going to need some time for that.  If you don't want to listen to this, just fucking Google bandolier, and then everyone  will be on my side.  Oh, no.  We already talked.  I had that in last week.  I don't care.  It stinks.  We're going to redo the bandolier thing.  We'll take a picture of your bag and my bag, and we'll decide which one's gay or rota.  Is there a social media site where we can have a polling?  No, because his bag. 
[00:16:30]  We can poll.  They didn't have internet back when his bag was popular.  Can't we get the pictures up somewhere where people can vote which is the gay or bag?  Yeah, we should.  We should definitely have a poll.  How do we do that?  They have a Twitter poll.  Maybe the Facebook page or the Twitter poll.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Go back to the Rashad Evans thing, so ask him the question.  All right.  No, I'm not asking Rashad Evans fight week about a rumor.  No.  What's the rumor?  Seriously?  Yeah.  The guy, Chipstick, says that Jon Jones might have had a little thing with your wife or 
[00:17:00]  something.  What?  Are you out of your mind?  I didn't want to say it.  But you did.  What was it?  But you did.  Is there?  Oh, boy.  Is that true?  He's saying it.  Is that true?  He's giving me the evil look.  No.  I'm going to get my ass kicked.  Yeah, well, rightly so.  Don't kill the messenger?  No.  Messenger, the guy, everyone.  I'm divorced now, but.  No.  But it was totally un-John Jones related.  Besides.  That's a battle you never want to get into. 
[00:17:30]  Thank God.  My wife is not John Jones type.  Believe me.  All right.  We should stop breathing for a second.  I really got to.  I literally couldn't look at Rashad because I didn't ask it to, but I was just trying  to remember you as I knew you.  That's it, I guess.  I like how Anthony went, what?  He's like, he's trying to cover up that uncomfortable because it was so, it was going to be so brutal.  What?  What are you talking about?  Anthony hates being uncomfortable in this studio.  Fucking hates it.  And I've put him in some bad, uncomfortable spots over the years.  I like how Jimmy turned into the worm that he is and just didn't talk and put his head 
[00:18:00]  down and waited for it to be over.  His eyes got really big and he just stared at me.  Even though Rashad was right to his right, he didn't want to look at Rashad to see his  reaction.  I would have done the same thing.  I would have just put my head down and waited for everything to be over.  Yeah.  Fucking loaded.  I was in ref warm this weekend on the way back from the bathroom.  I told Anthony, you might want to put your brim down.  It could get ugly in there because we had a situation with John Cusack that worked out  fine.  It was all good in the end, but John Cusack with the, he was late for his interview with  us.  So I was, I was ready to kind of blow up some shit and have fun. 
[00:18:30]  His fucking hair piece.  Is it a hair piece?  No, I don't know.  He's the only one who has hair that looks like a hair piece.  I think that's his hair, but it just, it hasn't changed in 25 years.  Iraq looks like that.  Iraq looks like he has a hair system.  I never noticed it.  Oh my God.  We talk about it all the time.  He has a lot of hair, but for some reason how it's on his head, it looks like it's a  hair system.  Yeah.  It's a him.  You know, the one that has the fucking 90 degree, those guys that have the 90 degree  angle on the sides. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  It's too far down on the forehead.  Why can't they figure that out where it's a drastic angle on the sides?  That's the, that's the giveaway.  Why can't you fucking soften that angle out a little bit?  Yeah.  You know, where it comes up too far in the forehead, like over here.  Yeah.  But then it's a complete 90 degree turn.  It goes from here and then straight down.  That's where they're fucking up the hair pieces.  Look, he'll find me a picture.  This should be like a little curve.  A little bit.  A little bit of a curve.  A little bit.  Yeah.  So John Cusack's hair is awful. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  He was Liam Neeson have the worst hair.  John Cusack turned out to be a pretty damn cool.  Really, uh, we've heard rumors that he's a hard interview, but he was great, man.  See, look at that.  See, there's the big fucking angle.  No one's hair naturally is like that.  So why can't you figure it out if you're getting a hair piece?  Well, that's just lazy wigging.  Yeah.  There are lazy wiggings.  Yeah.  There's guys who just don't wash their wig.  There are guys that just put it on the top of their head.  Yeah.  They don't even give a fuck that their gray sideburns don't match it anymore. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, just lazy, like Travolta is not a lazy wigger.  No, he fucking spends a lot of time on that shit.  Gorgeous wigs.  To make sure it looks all right.  Yeah.  You're right.  Yeah.  There's guys who, when they first got the wig, you know, did what they were supposed to do.  Yeah.  But then slowly got lazy and lazy.  Yeah.  That's a lazy wigger.  That's what's his name.  He's down there in Washington.  He's one of the famous guys with the horrible hair.  Yeah.  What's his fucking name?  I don't know. 
[00:20:30]  I don't know these guys.  He has to grow his side hair to match his other hair, though.  That's what's awful.  Yeah, yeah.  It has to be a little long.  So who are you picking Saturday, tomorrow?  Rashad or Jon Jones?  I mean, UFC 145 is going to be huge.  I don't, you're really into it, Bobby.  I only get the pay-per-views every once in a while.  This is one of them I'm getting.  This is one you should get.  Absolutely.  If you're into UFC at all, a little bit, you should get this fight.  This fight is going to be, there's a lot of personal shit going on with this fight.  And if Rashad pulls it off, because he's the only one, he's, I thought Machida could pull 
[00:21:00]  it off, almost did, really won the first round.  Right.  You know, won most of the first round.  He, I mean, Rashad is the one that could pull it off because he's a wrestler.  What he did to Phil Davis, he took him down over and over again.  And Phil's a bigger guy, just like Jon Jones is.  This is going to be a fight.  And they don't fucking like each other.  I mean, legitimately don't like each other.  You think we'll get a long fight?  No. 
[00:21:30]  I don't think so.  I don't know.  Look, you don't know what these guys, because I don't, Jon Jones finishes, and he's one of  the only guys out of Greg Jackson's camp.  Greg Jackson is the guy who comes up with the game plan.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  All right.  Greg Jackson is.  I don't either.  I'm sure out there someone is enjoying this.  Everybody knows.  Yeah.  Greg Jackson is the guy.  Explain it to the dummies like myself.  Okay.  Greg Jackson is the trainer.  And he trains George St. Pierre, Carlos Condit.  He has these guys.  And he usually comes up with a game plan, which is to hold the belt.  Or get the belt.  And it's kind of like boxing, where it gets a little boring. 
[00:22:00]  It goes the distance.  It's a little boring.  The guy will run a little bit, so he doesn't get his ass kicked.  It's like if you go head-to-head with a striker, you might lose.  You know, there's some fighters like Nick Diaz who will just, I don't give a shit.  I'll fight.  If he goes to the ground, I'll go to the ground.  I'm here to fight.  Right.  And it's always an exciting fight.  John Jones goes to win.  He goes to tap somebody out or knock them the fuck out with an elbow.  Those pointy elbows. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  He's an elbow.  He's never really knocked somebody out with a punch.  I don't think he's, but he gets people down and brings these elbows, rains elbows down on people.  And he's very unconventional.  He does weird shit.  Looks like a spider.  Yeah.  He'll fucking just spin around, do some weird shit that no one's ever done.  Right.  That will throw you off.  And he's got an 82-inch reach, I think, or something like that.  84-inch reach.  He's got just like a foot on most guys he's fighting.  He could be a heavyweight if you put on a little more weight. 
[00:23:00]  That's how big this kid is.  But Rashad is a wrestler, strong, and can knock people out.  So he can actually win this fight.  But they're both from Greg Jackson's camp.  But when they were to fight the title, it got messed up and Rashad left.  That's where it all, Rashad helped Greg Jackson become what he is.  And then this new guy stepped in and Greg Jackson basically, they got in a little tiff and now Rashad's out.  So there's a lot of back story, which is always fun. 
[00:23:30]  But I think Rashad, if anybody, could take Jon Jones out.  Because someone's got to.  It's got to happen.  That's why I love the UFC.  It's going to happen.  Eventually.  Yeah.  And I don't think this fight's going to go the distance.  Someone's going to get hurt real quick.  We like both guys, too.  They've both been really cool on the show.  It's going to be a great fight.  They've both given us a lot of radio.  Yeah.  This is going to be worth your 60 bucks.  Some of the fights, you're like, oh, shit.  If it goes, ugh, Nick Diaz, Carlos Condit, that shit went the distance.  He ran.  It was like, fuck.  You know, and then you can't really fight that. 
[00:24:00]  Well, what do you want him to do?  Stand there and get punched?  I get it.  I know.  But I want him to fucking fight.  But this one's going to be a humdinger.  You do UFC, Florentine?  A little bit.  I'm starting to get into it more.  Yeah.  That's one sport I do, definitely.  Boxing to me is, you know, boring.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm getting to the point where it's just like.  You should get this weekend's fight.  I know, I've watched some UFC stuff, and it definitely is good.  This would be a good one to pop your cherry.  Yeah.  Yeah, because there's a lot going into this fight.  Yeah.  I need some action.  And plus, Rashad, I think he's going to win just because he's going to have hatred because 
[00:24:30]  he's visualizing Jon Jones banging his ex-wife now.  That might have been.  And this guy throws that into the mix.  What are you going to do?  It just makes me, doesn't it make me, and the way he asked it was just so fucking uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Twiddle Sticks wants to know this rumor.  Twiddle Sticks.  Whatever name he used.  From a faraway line.  And you know there's no fucking. 
[00:25:00]  The guy was from a faraway line.  There's no Twiddle Sticks on fucking Twitter.  No.  We can research that.  You never know.  It's just coming from his iPhone notes.  You never know.  Yeah.  I do take notes.  I didn't take notes for today's show.  Oh, God.  No notes today.  Unbelievable.  Today is all about just fucking hanging.  That was a made-up name.  Fuck.  Twiddle Sticks.  Yeah.  Twiddle Sticks 17.  I don't know if I should ask this.  Oh, yeah.  He stepped right into it.  You fucking coy motherfucker.  Oh, man.  And then I love it. 
[00:25:30]  I love Anthony.  Yeah, come on.  Go ahead.  Do it.  His voice gets a little higher.  What are you?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Poor Jimmy's just nervous.  Yeah.  So you brought your Bandolarian, and Florentine brought it up.  Yeah.  It's just the...  I got one coming for you.  It's really called the...  It's Go Runner with two U's.  A Go Runner?  Go Runner.  Why does it have to have two U's in the title?  Because...  I don't know. 
[00:26:00]  Runner.  I don't know.  It's like the new version of the fanny pack is what it is.  Yes.  It's a...  Why don't you have it on?  It's a bandolier.  Right now, I have it on?  No.  Why don't you have it on so you could really sell it to Florentine?  Florentine would never hear that.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I know Florentine enough to know...  I don't care if Jessica Alba was naked with that on, or it's not going to sell me on it.  It almost makes you look military.  Look at that.  Like you got an AK.  Now you're going to the airport, right?  Hang on.  You're going to the airport. 
[00:26:30]  I got my wallet.  I got my phone.  I got my headphones.  I got all my other bullshit.  I got my...  In here, I got my...  I got my ticket.  I got...  I got everything.  And now when I'm going through, I go like this.  Like that.  And when I get on the plane, I just put that right in the back.  Everything.  I got all my pens.  I got everything right here.  Car keys.  He's got paper pens.  Everything.  A bottle...  The bottle of water is stupid.  I know.  Yeah.  You can really begin to be thirsty walking through the airport.  When you walk through this...  You can't bring that through security anyway, a bottle of water.  No. 
[00:27:00]  Really?  Yeah.  You can't.  Why are you saying it like it's a new fact that nobody...  We all know that.  No, because you're saying that's what you bring through security.  No.  You can actually...  When you go through, you get some water.  You're going to want to run on the plane.  It's very important to be hydrated when you fly.  But who carries their water around?  Do you know that, right?  It is.  Dehydration is one of the...  But who carries their water around?  When you need water, you get a bottle of water and you slam it within 30 seconds.  Yeah, you go...  Wait a minute.  And you just sip it.  Wait a minute.  You sip it like a girl?  Yeah, like fucking fine wine.  So you get a bottle...  Girls sip their water.  They...  In the gym, you know, they put...  They have to keep putting the cap on. 
[00:27:30]  They take a little sip.  I'm doing a lot of work.  Let me...  I just did three sit-ups.  Now I got to look at my fucking iPhone to see if somebody liked my fucking Facebook page.  And then they got a little packet of goodness to put in their water.  Yeah, let me put some water.  Yeah.  Let me put a flavor in.  Yeah, a little flavor.  Because I can't just drink straight water.  Let me put a little orange flavor today.  I like orange flavor.  Yeah, this is good, this stuff.  You don't see girl...  Oh, you don't go to the gym, so you don't know this shit.  Oh, there he is.  He broke it.  Is it a fat joke?  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  What was that?  Was that a fat joke, really?  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Was that a fat joke?  Was it, though?  6.39.  6.39 first fat joke.  Was it really a fat joke, though?  You should give me...  Sam, do.  Yeah.  You should give me $10 every time one slips out.  Maybe it's an out-of-shape fucking...  No, that's a fat joke.  Fat meets fat.  No, it was...  That's a fat joke?  Yeah.  Bobby, I'm really sorry.  Dude, don't be sorry to me.  I'm really sorry to you, because you have no code.  But he hit you in the eye with something.  Yeah, he did.  I didn't want...  What the hell was that?  That was a Starboard coffee thing.  All right.  Fuck.  That was instinctual.  I just threw it at his eye. 
[00:28:30]  That joke was instinctual, I guess.  Fuck.  I'm really going to try, Bobby.  Can I ask you a question?  Can you give me just one?  I'll get that.  You can have one, but from now on, it's $10 every time you make one.  $10.  Shit.  I happen to have cash today.  All right, good.  I still owe Aunt 20.  We'll get a fat jar.  Huh?  A fat jar?  Just get a jar.  It's a fat jar.  It can just be a jar.  It's a fat jar.  No, that's the...  You're defeating...  Get a really wide jar.  You're defeating...  A wide jar.  There's another one. 
[00:29:00]  That's another one.  No, I'm going with that.  That one is a wide jar.  Like a big pickle jar.  You can't do it.  No, that one needs to make fun of the jar.  He's not making fun of the jar.  I don't know.  I was making fun of the jar.  There's jars that are not wide.  Yeah, but I'm saying...  I'm saying I need a wide jar because I might, you know, I might happen to fuck up a lot.  I don't like the word wide.  No, but you could say a tall jar if you're going to fuck up a lot to throw a lot of bills in it.  No, I need to get, like, my hand in a wide jar to put my...  Listen, you're not using fucking gold doubloons.  It's dollar bills or tents. 
[00:29:30]  What kind of jar can we get?  It's a fat jar because it's like a swear jar or a fat jar.  I'm not saying fat jar.  I'm going to go wide jar.  I'm going to throw the bell at you.  I'm not saying you're fat.  I'm saying the jar.  Shut up.  Swear jar, fat jar.  Do we have an intern today?  Get some jars around here.  They must be floating around the place, and we'll pick which jar I could use for this.  The bones on your head are freaking me out.  I'm sorry.  I mean, it looks like a little...  It's starting to weird me out, dude.  You need to gain some weight.  I think I'm in a better position than you.  No, you're not.  No, what is that?  What is that bone?  It's like horns. 
[00:30:00]  It's not horns.  It's my forehead.  Yeah.  See the bones on the side of his head?  No one else has bones like that, Sam.  You all right?  I'm perfectly fine.  Are you mutating into something?  Yeah.  No.  Bob, your bones in your face used to be highly more visible.  Well, let me ask you a question.  Another one.  When you get angry, do wings come out of your head?  All right.  Where were we?  Oh, the girls at the gym sipping their water.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  Yeah, with the little fucking lovey for my calf back on.  Can I...  I got to go with this with Florentine for a second. 
[00:30:30]  So you go to the gym a lot, right?  Yeah.  On a regular basis.  Is there anything more infuriating when you have a woman, usually middle-aged...  You stop right there.  ...going from machine to machine with her purse?  Do you get this at your gym?  What do you...  They literally go from machine to machine and put down their purse to do their reps.  It's like they don't leave that shit in the locker.  Sam knows.  I've seen it.  You haven't seen this?  Wow.  What are you working on?  The YMCA? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, it's a pretty cool gym, man.  But for some reason, these women have to bring all their stuff while they're working out  because they're not really working out.  They don't want to bring a lock for their locker.  Is that what that is?  I don't know.  I guess they don't even...  And then they can't figure out anything and you're waiting.  Well, then they're always on the phone, too, on the treadmill and they're screaming  into their phone.  Right, right.  You can't have two seconds alone without your phone.  I wrote my...  To fucking focus.  I wrote my wife the other day.  This woman that was right next to me on the treadmill had the worst fucking BO ever. 
[00:31:30]  Really?  And I was trying to figure out how I could take a picture of her fucking sweaty armpits  to prove to the world that I was miserable.  It was the worst smell I've ever smelled from a woman.  It was disgusting.  You sure it was coming from her arms?  It was coming from everything.  It had to be a combination of her ass sweat, her armpit sweat.  Fucking twat.  Her twat.  Breaking the seal of her pussy with the sweat.  Yeah, I know.  Because it starts mixing up the juices in there. 
[00:32:00]  Another reason why...  Once it gets a little sweaty.  Another reason why you've got to shave some of that shit down, because it keeps the smells  away.  What, the pubes?  Yeah, the pubes will fucking keep the smell going.  Yeah, because the box won't get that smelly until you start mixing it up in there.  Right.  Like, when it's dry, and they take your pants off, it's okay.  There's nothing.  But once you start stirring, you know what I mean?  Stirring like the pot of sauce.  That's when...  I don't know.  There's, like, dust flying off their pubes or something.  It's like when you microwave some spaghetti the next day, and it kind of heats up, and 
[00:32:30]  the sides...  That little...  All right, buddy.  That was good.  I got what you're saying.  Hey, thanks, Sam Bones.  Oh, so the...  Thanks, porn head.  So the bandolier.  You guys actually, when you get a bottle of water, because you've had a bottle of water  for around a half hour now, and you haven't guzzled it.  Do you just shot it?  You shoot it down?  You're amazed that people could just slam a bottle of water, but we're just sitting  around, so yeah, it might be...  We're talking about people that have to walk around New York with their bottle of water. 
[00:33:00]  I always keep water on me to fucking dehydrate.  When I need to hydrate, I slam a bottle of water, and I continue.  I don't slam water.  What is slamming water?  There's nothing enjoyable about water, so you get it into your system as fast as possible.  Yeah, when you get home, you guzzle a glass.  You don't carry around a bottle.  I don't guzzle water.  That's the best feeling when you guzzle water.  Sipping water sucks.  Sipping a beer or something is all right.  You're saying there's either sipping or guzzling.  There's a mid-ground...  Drinking.  Yeah, drinking.  No, me and quarantine are basically saying you sip like a girl. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, a lot of guys don't carry...  Let me get another sip of my water.  Yeah.  A lot of guys don't walk around with a bottle of water around the city.  They just don't.  They just don't.  You know what?  If it's going to be like 98 degrees and they say like 110 heat index, then you go, you might  want to bring some water with you.  That's when I do it.  Yeah, well, it's fucking 50 out and you got your bottle.  Yeah, I know.  That was here.  I put that in there to show you.  No.  I think you have water all the time.  You do.  You just said you do.  You got to hydrate when you're on a plane, walking through an airport.  You do.  You do have to hydrate.  You do have to hydrate. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, okay.  I know, because a lot of people pass out.  You have to hydrate.  I know, because a lot of people pass out on flights because they don't have to hydrate  with water.  No, not anymore, because they know how to hydrate.  No, because that's what's happening.  And they never give you anything to drink either on a plane.  The point is...  Yeah, because that's what's happening.  People are just falling in the aisles.  Like, what happened?  He didn't drink his water.  Yeah, that's what happened to Kevin Smith.  Didn't that happen to Kevin Smith?  I don't know.  The point is...  The point is, if a guy gets a bottle of water as they're walking around, he has it for maybe  five minutes.  Tops.  It's just ridiculous. 
[00:34:30]  And then throws the bottle away.  Exactly.  Facts.  You guys are just making up stupid facts.  It's not a stupid fact.  There's no way that a guy gets...  Martin said it beautifully.  Girls are the ones that walk around with their stupid water.  Girls walk around with water.  And then they have their water jugs.  Yeah, they put it in their jug with the little sippy thing.  Has a nice little...  A little straw.  Like one of those right there?  A built-in straw.  It's called a Nalgene bottle.  Yeah, like that...  What?  What is that?  Let me see that, Sam.  Yeah, that's how they walk around.  Why would you do that?  But they usually have the straw sticking out, too. 
[00:35:00]  Just fucking go over to the water fountain if you're thirsty at the gym.  All right?  Stop walking around with your fucking water and you got to put it down next to the machine  that you can do three reps on.  You're not even paying attention.  I'm a water fountain guy.  I don't give a fuck.  Exactly.  And I still drink out of the fucking tap, too.  How about that?  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, our parents, you know, live to fucking 80 or 90 drinking out of the tap and drinking  out of a water fountain.  You drink out of the water fountains, Bobby?  Yeah, I do.  But I didn't know it made me a fucking man.  Jesus Christ.  It does make you...  First of all, there's a big difference between the water and the water. 
[00:35:30]  Get your lips right on that water fountain.  My grandfather could swim in the hut and you jacked.  The hut's in you, fucking idiot.  We've polluted a water.  Okay, all right.  I know.  Here we go.  New York State has, they say, the best water in the whole country.  Not for long.  Because it comes from the mountains.  Not for long.  Why didn't we pollute back in the 50s and 60s?  Why did we just start now?  Why did we start 10, 20 years ago?  Because we didn't know how to fucking...  We didn't have the technology to fucking...  Bobby.  ...get down and get natural gases and fracture the fucking earth's crust. 
[00:36:00]  You're telling me...  My dad, when he had a fucking load of shit that he wanted to get out of the garage,  he was just dumping in the fucking ocean.  Okay, you can't do that anymore.  Yeah, they did that for a long time.  They dumped oil in the ocean.  They did all that shit back then.  You can't do it now.  They dumped shit in the ocean.  Yeah, when our parents were drinking from the tap and it was fine.  No, they polluted the fucking water by doing that dumb-dumb.  Yeah, and that's the water they were drinking and they still lived to 90.  That's my point.  No, they didn't drink that fucking water.  They used to dump...  They weren't drinking the fucking Hudson.  Bobby, you just said your fucking grandfather would swim across and it was fine. 
[00:36:30]  They probably dumped more bad shit when our parents were growing up.  Absolutely.  Is what he's saying.  And there's new diseases coming, so you got to drink polluted water to get a little taste  of these new diseases so your body could adjust.  Right?  Oh, that's a wide jug.  Mm-hmm.  See?  That one's perfect.  I said wide.  That actually has the same...  That's an actual wide...  That looks like my body.  That's the same contour as me.  I'm not going to say anything.  And you're not allowed.  You have to put money in the fat jar. 
[00:37:00]  That's right.  That's right.  Does it have to be ten bucks?  All right, do a dollar.  Oh, fuck.  It's like a swear jar.  Oh, you just made it easy for him.  Yeah, now he's just going to reel off the fat jar.  Dude, I was just going to do it now.  You're right.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's not a good move.  It has to be...  I would easily do...  Yeah.  You're going to be like a stripper at the end of the night counting fucking singles.  I would have no problem doing a hundred.  All right.  We're going to do five dollars.  Five dollars?  All right.  Ten bucks.  Ten bucks.  Ten bucks.  No, no, no.  Slow down, Bobby.  Let's calm down.  You're a fucking millionaire.  You have fuck you money.  Multi.  Let's go with five.  Up till October.  Yeah.  Then I have to start spending. 
[00:37:30]  Fuck.  Yeah.  I know it's going to drop fast.  Call five.  Then you're going to be on Riot Cast with me.  Yes.  That's right.  Save me a spot.  We've got an advertiser now.  Yeah, we're going to have...  Me and Jim finally have a nice fucking advertiser.  Are you making money?  We just started.  A little bit.  We just got AdamandEve.com.  Just started.  I just need a little pocket money.  I just started.  That's all I need to continue.  Yeah.  There you go.  We just got some advertising.  Good, good.  So let's get back to his Bolero bag.  It's not a Bolero.  Whatever it is.  But I do like the name Bolero.  Yeah, it's a little more manly than your...  It's almost Spanish. 
[00:38:00]  Bolero.  I mean, to be honest, I think only a fat guy could wear something like that.  Five, ten.  No, that doesn't count.  That's...  That's...  I'm not a judge, Bobby.  Not you.  He got to the line.  He got to the line, but he didn't cross it.  Really?  I think he crossed it there.  That's an observation.  I want...  No, you get to have Sam as your judge, and I want Florentino as my judge.  Hold on a minute.  How about we do this?  I'm the king of the fat jokes, and I know.  How about we do this?  Put the bandolier on Sam, and you tell me I'm wrong.  That's fair.  It's going to look completely ridiculous. 
[00:38:30]  That's fair.  Which will prove my point that it's only for fat guys.  That's not the point.  That's not the fucking point.  What's the point?  The fat...  The fat joke you just made.  It's not in the rules to hit me every time there's a fat joke.  That's not...  There's a fat...  That's a fat joke.  That means I get my five bucks back.  You just admitted...  Ten.  ...that it was a fat joke.  It's ten bucks.  No, it's not ten bucks.  Let's all calm down.  It's ten, but that last one wasn't a fat joke.  But it is ten.  I have my judge.  My judge says it is.  We went with the five dollar thing after the first one.  Let's take a vote, then.  Who wants ten?  I do.  Who wants five? 
[00:39:00]  No, I'd rather ten.  We have sons.  We have sons.  I know, but I'd rather ten, because it's going to really...  I need to get someone on my side.  It's going to hold you back, because you might have one.  You go, you know what?  It's worth five dollars to throw this fat joke out there.  What do you want?  Ten.  Three to one, it's ten.  How is it ten?  Why is it ten?  For what jokes?  It's ten dollars for a fat joke.  No, it's five.  No, it's ten.  I thought you meant I owe ten already.  No, no, no.  Well, no.  Let's get a clean slate right now.  The show will be boring if it's ten.  No, it's true.  It'll be better.  Five dollars a fat joke.  I might throw a few out there. 
[00:39:30]  No, because you're going to throw one out by mistake.  My number in my head is I'll lose a hundred today.  No problem.  That means either ten or twenty jokes.  I'm going to donate this.  I'm going to donate this.  I'm going to donate this.  He's got a good point.  It's five.  All right.  Then we get twenty fat jokes.  We might get twenty fat jokes.  Ten.  That means only ten.  I could just pepper them here and there.  He's going to put money in like in advance.  I'm going to donate this money to a fat listener.  Really?  To help him.  Really?  So any only listener that calls in can actually. 
[00:40:00]  All of them.  Put the bandolier on Sam.  To prove my point, it's only for larger gentlemen.  So Sam, who weighs how much, Sam?  How much you weigh, Sam?  Probably about a hundred and thirty.  All right.  Look how stupid that looks on him.  Awful.  Looks good.  Ridiculous, right?  Yeah.  No, ridiculous.  Now, Bobby, put it on.  Let me put it on you.  Ooh.  Look, it's like part of your body.  See, look.  It's meant for a larger gentleman. 
[00:40:30]  Here's the thing.  I got a large one.  They have small for him.  Oh, they do have small.  Yeah, they have different sizes.  You got me one?  Yeah.  I got Opie one.  Opie, you got one coming in.  But someone's saying I polluted the ocean by shitting in it.  I did not pollute the ocean.  I did shit in the ocean.  You shit in the ocean?  Of course.  We've done this bit already.  People get sick of it.  I shit in a lake.  It's a little, it's a little.  You do shit in the lake?  I've shit in the lake.  And my, the guy, my, I was in my cousin, Billy, the guy we were staying with made me  take it out because he got mad.  I just, a big, like a foot long shit. 
[00:41:00]  You want to take it out?  I had to go.  I thought it was funny because me and my sister were swimming in this lake.  And I just, I mean, a huge shit.  It had to be a foot long and it popped right up.  It was nice and fluffy.  He got mad because he was like a fucking environmentalist or whatever.  And he goes, you get that the fuck out of there.  I had to go in, I had to go in with like, I think it was a badminton racket.  Yeah.  And pick it up and put it in a bag and just took all the fun out of the fucking shit in 
[00:41:30]  the lake.  That's hilarious.  Me and my friend did it at the Action Park.  Remember that place up in Jersey?  Sure.  On that water slide we shit in the bottom.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Did they have to close the water slide?  I don't know.  We just left.  Nowadays they close the water slide.  We just left.  You shit off.  Yeah.  Once we hit the water off the end of the slide in the pool.  So how did you get that done?  We shit and we just got out.  You just pulled your pants down?  Yeah.  Just, yeah.  We were just hanging out like all the water was flowing all over the place.  You know, big waves.  Was it a messy one?  No, it was like, it was like one turd.  It was a nice solid turd.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  One that you don't have to wipe with.  You know, like one of those.  Mine was a messy one in the ocean.  And then the birds came.  And it is a true story.  And then my mother-in-law and my wife's aunt were just finishing their walk.  And I'm like, I'm praying they don't see that the wave came up and just spread all over the place.  And the birds were having a feast.  How long ago was this?  It was last summer.  Or the summer before.  I do it every year.  I'm trying to remember what year that story was. 
[00:42:30]  But you did it.  Why?  Oh, no.  I think it was two years ago.  You had to go?  Because it was too far to get back to the house we were renting.  And you had to go bad.  I figured there was no one around.  But did you have to go bad?  Or you just did it as a go?  Okay.  It was, you know, you wake up in the morning.  You got it.  Everyone has to go in the morning.  And I went down to the ocean with my coffee.  Had the XM cranking some nice tunes.  And I'm like, you know what?  It's beautiful out here.  No one's around.  Sounds like an XM commercial.  So I'm just going to fucking do it right here. 
[00:43:00]  So I usually go down to the water line and squat.  And usually it takes it out to sea.  Wait a minute.  You usually?  So you weren't even like knee deep or shoulder deep in the water and did it?  I didn't want to get.  No.  So that's where I thought you did it.  I thought, all right, that's fine.  I thought you were in the water.  No.  Hanging out.  You had to take a shit out.  Yeah, I'm out here.  This guy goes down like fucking Christopher Columbus used to do.  Did you bring the paper with you?  No.  No, I'm quick.  So that's key to this, too.  I'm quick, man.  What beach are you shitting on that there's nobody else around? 
[00:43:30]  Out of banks at 630 in the morning.  There's no one around.  But they went for an early morning walk.  And they happened to be coming back right when the whole thing was spread out.  So what did you wipe with?  Well, that's the problem.  You got to kind of squat in such a way that maybe you could hang for another hour or two before you go back to the house and take care of everything.  So your asshole had shit in it?  It didn't feel like it.  Or did you wait for a wave to come in?  No, I didn't want to go swimming yet.  It was too early in the morning.  Why don't you just go in the water up to your waist, take a shit?  I guess that would be better. 
[00:44:00]  And then you could use your finger to clean it.  No, because then I thought the shit would kind of be all around me because it wasn't going to be a solid one.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  So now I'm like dealing with all sorts of wrongs.  Wait, so you just squat it down like right?  Yeah, I go.  Right at the edge of the water, basically, in the sand.  I'm further in because the waves are kind of coming through my ankles, I guess.  Okay, so the water is about your ankles.  You did it right there.  You squatted down.  How long?  30 seconds?  Yeah, real fast.  And then the next wave kind of pushed it all up toward the beach. 
[00:44:30]  And the birds came from everywhere.  So it must have hit you, too.  Well, yeah, but if I'm all the way in, that would be more of a problem.  So you didn't wipe your ass.  You just let it go.  Yeah.  It wasn't solid.  I try to spread out in such a way that maybe there wouldn't be as much damage.  You know.  How old are you?  I'm old.  And this is what you do on vacation?  Yeah, why not?  A lot?  Well, probably every morning.  I don't want to go back to the house.  But isn't there like...  How far was the house?  Yeah, like eight miles. 
[00:45:00]  Well, I mean, we got a house right on the water last year, so I didn't do it as much  if at all.  I don't even remember if I did it last summer because it was a lot easier to get to the  house.  But we usually were a couple houses back.  So that was probably...  I mean, it could be like an eighth of a mile.  So there are houses near you while you're taking the shit, though?  So someone could have been looking out the window, though?  Nah, I don't think so.  On the porch?  Nah.  Someone at an oceanfront house?  I got my car backed up, too.  Which, by the way, yes, I could have drove my car back to the house to go to the bathroom.  The listeners have heard this shit over and over again. 
[00:45:30]  And then seagulls came and just started to go.  All sorts of birds, man.  They shared in the feast.  Like someone threw french fries on the fucking ground.  Were they digging it?  Or were they just taking one taste and going, ugh?  They seem to love human shit.  They seem to love it.  They gobble that crap up.  This shit is fucking beautiful.  They fucking...  They gobble that shit up.  Just imagine if he got caught.  No, but where I go, it's like nature.  The houses are kind of far apart.  It's like nature.  It's nature shit. 
[00:46:00]  It's not like, you know, Jersey Shore where everybody's on top of each other.  You kind of spread out a little bit.  It's nice.  Imagine if you got caught, though.  You shit in a lake.  Shut up.  Yeah, but I was fucking eight.  Oh, really?  This wasn't like last time?  Yeah, and I was in my 20s when I did it at Action Park.  Yeah, would you open up because you thought I did it last year?  I was eight swimming with my sister in a lake in New Hampshire.  But I know you a little bit.  You would do that.  No.  No, I'm not going to squat at the fucking edge of the ocean. 
[00:46:30]  How much did you spend a lot of money on the house?  Oh, yeah, I did.  Yeah.  Just picture, though, if he got caught.  Like TMZ would be like, you know, radio star shitting, getting caught shitting on the beach.  That would be great.  I would love that picture.  People would think you would be the biggest animal that you shit on the beach.  Oh, that would be fantastic.  People, the locals got pissed off.  They heard that you did it?  Well, because of Twitter and stuff, and then it made some of their fucking sites and shit.  This animal shitting on our beach. 
[00:47:00]  See, that's why he has to go to Ocean City, Maryland this year.  That's why he was asking.  Just small, dumb blocks.  Nothing big enough.  Yeah, you should make it way out of that.  Jesus Christ.  Whatever.  I thought you shit in the lake last year.  No, I was eight.  Fuck, I thought you were with me on that one.  No.  I'm with you.  I'm with it.  And my shit was nice and fluffy.  Florentine would shit tomorrow in public somewhere.  Too many cameras.  Can't do shit like you used to, you know?  Fucking bothers me. 
[00:47:30]  You'd like to be able to do shit like you used to.  I shit in a urinal one time at my friend's wedding.  I left a turd in the urinal in a bathroom.  Yeah, you've done some crazy stuff.  There you go.  Delper Deckers and stuff.  I know your stuff.  By the way, Florentine's hiding his bag.  I'm not hiding it.  You're wearing yours proudly, Bobby.  Yeah, your bag is worse than...  It must be gay pride week.  Your bag is worse than my bag.  He called you bandolier gay.  It's not even...  That's a nice word for it.  Dude, your bag is fucking stupid. 
[00:48:00]  It's a bag.  It's a bag with a strap on it that I carry stuff in.  Bobby...  I don't have a water bottle.  Where's your bag?  Let me for my pens.  Where's your bag?  I got a spot for my pens.  Where's your bag?  You know what?  Florentine's right.  What makes the bandolier a little weird is the pen holder and the water holder.  Yeah.  Dude, look at this.  Look, you got two pens.  Who needs pens?  I know.  What do you have pens for?  You got a phone.  If you think of a comedy bit, you're going to go, hey, I just saw this guy walking us  through there.  And you're going to put a right in your phone.  What am I going to do?  You're going to go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:48:30]  You can talk at your phone or, obviously, you can just, you can write a note for yourself.  He's fucking Mr. Technology over there.  Mr. fucking Instagram, Mr. Holly, whatever, hula shit.  Hula shit?  Yeah, whatever.  You're not going to use, you're not going to use, where's your little notepad?  You got a little notepad, too?  The only time I, the only time.  So what do you got the two pens for?  Why are you getting so angry?  Settle down, Jim.  Because no one needs pens.  He's right.  He doesn't need pens.  He's right about the pens.  If you don't have paper, they're useless.  I do have paper.  They're useless.  No, there's a place for his paper.  In here.  Let me see.  What was the last thing you wrote on the paper? 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  You guys are like the fucking seagulls on your shit.  Relax.  Let me answer one at a time.  We're getting mad.  You fucking nervous Nellie.  We're getting mad again.  I am getting mad.  First of all, that bag is fucking stupid.  Why is it stupid?  Because it's a woman's purse from the 70s.  Let me explain.  My mother had that bag.  My mother had that bag.  That bag.  Well, then she stole it from your dad because it's a fucking manly bag.  It's not a manly bag.  It's not a manly bag.  It's not as bad as Voss's bag, but it's... 
[00:49:30]  Look, Voss's bag.  It carries shit in it.  Voss's bag.  You've never seen Voss's bag?  It's absolutely a women's...  Louis Vuitton.  It's a Louis Vuitton.  Purse.  Purse.  He says it's not.  He's an asshole.  Florentine almost gets away because it's like black leather.  Look, it's got fucking manly shit in here.  It doesn't have a bottle of water.  You know what it has?  It has noise-canceling headphones.  It's got an iPod filled with metal, and it's got classic rock magazine.  It's all metal.  What else you got in there?  A Clif Bar. 
[00:50:00]  Exactly.  Tag.  And three pens.  Do you have pens?  In case my blood sugar level drops.  What's in the front?  What's in there?  My camera.  What else?  For celebrity photos.  What else?  My recorder.  I do my fucking podcast on.  What else you got?  Is that a good quality?  It's amazing.  Really?  $120.  That's it.  Zoom.  It's the Zoom.  Yeah, and it's just this little fucking whatever. 
[00:50:30]  Charger.  Battery.  Battery charger.  What else?  That's it.  And some deodorant.  Do you understand?  Do you have deodorant?  What else?  That's it.  What's in the front?  The front.  He's not going to open that part.  No, these are receipts.  Receipts and change.  Yeah, I'm fucking silly.  Ugh, you keep receipts?  Yeah, when I'm on the road, I keep receipts.  I pay my taxes, unlike you.  I pay my taxes.  Yeah, bullshit.  You have an Amex.  You have an Amex and it keeps your fucking receipts.  Yeah, I'm not one of these.  Yeah, this is the guy in the airport that buys the New York Post for 75 cents and pulls 
[00:51:00]  his fucking Amex out.  And it's assigned 16 papers for fucking 75 cents.  And that's why I have the pen.  Why don't you pay for it in three quarters?  And that's why I have the pen.  But aren't people constantly...  You know what?  The fact is, nobody's catching any traction because we're both fucking losers with gay  bags.  Bobby, aren't people constantly asking you to borrow your pen, though?  Isn't that annoying?  No.  You like lending out your pen?  No, nobody has to borrow my pen.  I don't even...  Unless I'm on an international flight.  The only time I use a pen is to sign bills. 
[00:51:30]  That's it.  No, I sign...  That is it.  I use it to sign credit cards, stuff on the road.  And I use it...  I have...  When I do a gig, like last night I had it.  I always write my set list down.  Every time.  I always write a set list down.  I always write of this...  I just said it twice.  We get you.  I always write my set list down.  Yeah, but I...  I live in Jersey, so I'm going to be in this city all day.  So I need a bag to have my shit in.  Right.  You live fucking four blocks away and you got that fucking belt on. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  It's a bandolier.  With two pens.  It's a bandolier.  What do you need to write with two pens walking four blocks?  I had to...  I wrote some thoughts.  Yeah, and you needed water for your four blocks when it's 50...  No, that was actually here.  I put that in.  If you remember, I put that in to show you what that's for.  Yeah.  I didn't bring this with me.  Was he demoing the water?  That's demo water.  That's demo water.  That's demo water.  Yeah, this is demo water.  That one was demo.  Last time he was in, he brought his own water.  Do you have any other friends that have that?  Yeah.  Jim Norton?  No, he doesn't.  I just got him one.  Yeah, but he doesn't... 
[00:52:30]  I don't know if he's going to wear it.  And it's in his apartment.  No, he's going to wear it.  He likes it.  No, he doesn't.  No, he does.  He doesn't.  There's no way Jim Norton would wear that.  He does.  He might on the road.  No.  He'll be traveling, maybe.  But I'm never going to wear mine, so you could give mine to somebody else.  No, you'll wear yours.  Why would I wear mine?  You're trying to push them on everybody.  They don't want them.  I don't want the pen thing.  They don't want them.  Does it come without the pen thing?  Get over it.  He wants one.  I asked him.  He wanted me to get him when I got him one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Great.  All right, listen.  I don't like the fucking...  He's in town for one day. 
[00:53:00]  He's got a fucking woman's purse with everything in it.  Everything.  You're a goddamn man.  And you have everything in it.  Yeah, I got an iPod and fucking headphones.  Keep going.  You have a fucking battery charger?  Yeah, for my podcast when I do it.  You have a Clif Bar?  Yeah.  What else you got in there?  Deodorant.  Three pens and deodorant.  Three pens and deodorant.  What else?  Change and receipts.  Yeah.  You look at old Jewish guys.  And classic rock magazine.  Ooh.  Why does that make you manly? 
[00:53:30]  Because it's metal.  He likes his metal.  Just metal makes you manly.  He likes his metal.  We're going to take a break.  Good start.  We're just fucking around.  Look, his two pens.  He's got his two.  He's got his two.  He's got his two.  Don't you like how he's got...  He has to show off that he's got the two pens with the clips.  Yeah, I don't like that.  I don't like the pen holder.  Yeah.  I'm trying to have an open mind.  The pen holder.  I don't know, man.  Why can't the pens be in the back?  They can be.  How's that?  How's that possible?  I just...  Oh, he's got a place for his keys. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, that makes it special.  You get it.  Oh, wow.  The pens are in the back.  Oh, the pens are in the back now.  All right.  All right.  He's got a little something for everybody there.  All right.  Now you're talking.  Now you get your sunglasses in the front.  Yeah.  I don't need a sunglass holder.  I could use that.  I either put them on my head or on my fucking eyes.  I don't need a holder.  You don't need a...  I don't need a sunglass holder.  I can take all your stuff and put it in this.  No.  That's a challenge.  I love how...  This makes me so happy how angry Florentine is about my bandolier. 
[00:54:30]  I just...  I just...  He's getting enraged.  He's staring at it like he wants to fucking...  That's the thing.  Like, if he has...  Someone takes a picture with that five years from now, he's going to look at that.  He goes, I can't fucking believe I walked around with that.  It's the same thing with those fucking fag bags.  I actually like the fag bags.  Anytime I go on vacation, first thing I do is get a fag bag.  Yeah, but I've only seen fat guys with fag bags.  No, so Rogan fucking wears a fag bag.  What?  All the time.  Oh, shit.  I don't think so.  What happened?  Why is everyone pointing at the jar again? 
[00:55:00]  Come on.  He's making an observation.  That was an observation.  You know what?  It's funny how he...  Skinny guys don't wear fag bags.  It's funny how he...  He has not said it about my bag.  Like, only fat guys walk around with a strap and deodorant in there and an iPod.  Different bag.  Yeah, and a cliff box.  He didn't say fat guy.  Yeah, fat guys would never eat a cliff box.  Nothing.  I think Florentine...  Thank you very much.  Florentine's my representation.  Sam is yours.  Eric is the judge.  Eric was that a fat joke?  He knows fat jokes.  Eric's fat, though.  That's true.  He's sensitive to them.  That's just mean.  But he knows it. 
[00:55:30]  He's not fat.  Eric, was that a fat joke?  That was definitely a fat joke.  Thank you.  He is fat.  He's the heaviest he's ever been.  Dude, you can't have...  E-Rock on your side.  Even though I despise that fucking thing around him.  Yeah.  Around Bob's so bad, that Bolero shit.  It's a bad Bolero.  I'm on his side.  That was a fat joke.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  That's a fat joke.  Five bucks in the jar.  Oh, you're going down to five.  I mean, ten.  Sorry, ten.  He said five, though.  No, we went with five.  We already...  Because then...  Yeah, I think the five's going to work better.  Yeah.  I think the five's going to work better.  It's five. 
[00:56:00]  Oh.  Five bucks in the fat jar.  Even though, you know...  It's not a fat jar.  I'm in the white jar.  It's a white jar.  It's a white jar.  That ain't my...  That was close.  That wasn't a fat joke toward him.  No, that's a fat jar like a swear jar.  Yeah, now it's a fat jar.  Yeah, but we have the jar here because...  Because it's...  You're not...  You're not supposed to do fat jokes about Bobby Kelly, so...  It is officially the fat jar.  So now we can officially call it the fat jar instead of the white jar.  I'm fucking been up all night, and I've never really done this show this tired. 
[00:56:30]  I'm literally...  I'm like two seconds behind everything.  You guys are talking, and I'm just watching your mouths move.  You're just whooshing?  I'm just...  Yeah, I'm fucking freaking out right now.  It's like I'm on drugs.  So how about we take a break?  Hey, let's take a break and get a little food, huh?  Let's get some food.  Of course you need food.  Hey...  Okay, that was a fat joke.  That's a fat joke.  And he sets you up, Brad, and you fell for it.  That's a fat joke.  That's five dollars to you.  That's five to you.  That's five.  Five to me.  That's fair.  That's fair.  That's five to you.  You can't make it easy, though.  I didn't make it easy.  I just said I want to eat.  I can't help myself. 
[00:57:00]  I'm a human being.  It's breakfast time.  See, I...  You want to eat.  We get some food.  That's all I said.  Let's get some food.  Five dollars.  I just said a caution.  What kind of food?  Don't repeat that joke.  No, don't do it.  That's another five.  Don't you repeat it.  Repeating is fucking counts.  No, we said it's now a fat jar.  So it's where the money's going for the fat jokes.  It's politically incorrect.  It's the wide jar.  No, we already agreed.  No, that's true.  Because if there was a gay comedian here, and we had that, if you made a gay joke... 
[00:57:30]  What do you mean, if?  Then it would be the fag jar.  See, he wouldn't keep saying, I've got to throw another one in a fag jar.  I would call it the fag jar, though.  Okay.  All right.  It's the fat jar.  We're all in agreement there.  Bingo.  All right.  Where are you guys going to be?  I'm going to be...  I'm going to be at Bananas.  You're not doing this for free.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie tonight and tomorrow night.  I love that club.  You know, I've never been there.  And I've been to almost every comedy club.  It's pretty cool.  It's in a hotel up in Poughkeepsie.  Is that still owned by the same people?  Rich Franchese owns it now.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, so I'll be there.  And then May 4th and 5th...  May 4th, Seattle.  May 5th, Portland, Oregon.  How's Portland?  Portland's amazing.  We'll talk about Portland next.  I want to go there for some reason.  I'm going to be at the...  I'm at Connecticut this weekend.  Tonight at Lorenzo's in West Haven.  And then Saturday, I'm at the Treehouse Comedy in Stanford.

Yeah, I was going to play something as the rejoinder coming back  Double topical  Double topical  Double topical  You're very lucky, Bobby  Why?  You're here for a double topical  Wow, I'm fucking honored  Alright, let's hear the other one now  So we got the, let's go smoke some pot  And then you're going to do what?  I hate Elvis Costello  You like Elvis Costello?  Horrendous  He is, right?  I don't get it  He'll be the most overrated ever 
[01:03:00]  I do  I like three songs  I live close to the Beacon Theater there  And when he plays New York, it sells out for like months  People love Elvis Costello  I never got it  I never got it  You like Elvis Costello?  I really don't  I hate that organ, whatever that fucking noise was  I hate that  That at the beginning of the song really makes me sick  Bobby's tripping  We got it  Did you hear the beginning of the song?  Did you hear that?  What is that? 
[01:03:30]  Right here  Look, I'm kind of  Call a guitar  No, no, no, no, stupid  Listen, at the beginning  We're not in the beginning  You want to start over?  Yeah, play the beginning of the song  All right, sure, go ahead  What is that?  That's a keyboard  That's an organ  Yeah, keyboard  I don't like keyboard  Keyboard action  Yeah, that's one of those old school ones  You don't like the keyboard shit?  I don't like that  It's actually really annoying me  I'm on your side  I was forced to do today's show  So I called up Bobby and Florentine  And I'm counting on Bobby  Me?  And then me and Florentine 
[01:04:00]  Are realizing very quickly  That Bobby is in another world  Yeah  Because he decided  That he didn't need to sleep  For the big morning show  He didn't need to sleep  To sit in Anthony's seat today  That's great  You need a lot of sleep  That's wonderful  I forced myself to go to sleep  At 10 o'clock last night  Really?  I missed some good fucking games  Yeah  Because I wanted to be prepared  Bobby's  Get up at 4.30  Bobby's making all sorts of weird faces  He was touching the mic before  He's like, it's really soft  Like a dick  It's really soft on the outside 
[01:04:30]  But it's hard in the middle  I think they're spraying stuff on here  Like, what the fuck?  Who studies microphones?  But Bobby did during the break  But do you see how he's touching it  Like it was a penis?  He's like, it's really  But he's making expressions  I've never seen before  You alright?  I'm good  When was the last time you slept?  I slept yesterday  Yesterday night  When was yesterday for you?  What time did you get up yesterday?  Fat cock they just brought me  What time did you get up yesterday?  Around like 10?  No, I had to get up at  I had to get up at 7 yesterday 
[01:05:00]  To radio  So you  And you didn't take a nap?  I went back to bed for 45 minutes  And then I had to drive to Maryland  Alright, so you've basically been up  For 24 hours  Yeah  Alright, it starts to get weird  After 24 hours  Yeah, well I don't get  This should be good  Here's the thing is  I don't get  I don't get high  I haven't been high in 27 years  So this is kind of cool  I don't get high either  Yeah  And it's not  You've never gotten  You never did drugs?  No, I smoked a little pot  When I was a teenager  Really?  Never did coke  Really?  None of that stuff, no  You just drink though  You drink  Yeah, I'll still drink 
[01:05:30]  But I don't  You get wasted?  Not really  Really?  You know, four times a year  Four times a year  You'll fucking binge  Yeah, I'll just  I've been thrown off  From drinking in 15 years  Oh yeah, no  That's  And you're probably the same guy  When you drink  As you are right now  Right now?  No, no  I get a lot more balls  When  You get more balls?  Why is it just drink?  Because I wanted to get laid  And I had no rap whatsoever  With chicks  And I was shy  So I put a few beers in me  And I'd go out and approach them  And just say awful things  Really?  Yeah 
[01:06:00]  God, we're similar  And that's the reason I drank  The more I hang out  But I only get a buzz  I never drank to get hammered  And pass out  Right  Girls used to come to me  I never had a rap  And they would come to you?  Yeah, all the time  I was never the pursuer  But he always came to me  And then I just fucking  You know  Yeah, but you were  I watched your one-man show  You used to be fucking atrocious  I mean, like, physically  And then  No, seriously  His one-man show is great 
[01:06:30]  His one-man show is great  But it shows  Why was he atrocious?  I've seen the pictures  With the long hair  But that was it  That was before  Before I had the long hair  He looked like he worked  At a minor key  Before he frosted his hair  Before he knew that  Can I see some of these pictures?  Talk about fucking gay  This guy  Used to frost his hair  Like Bon Jovi  No, it wasn't  He literally went from  A redhead  Like a ginger  Fucking goofy dude  With a mustache  To  I mean  A beautiful woman  Well, I 
[01:07:00]  And  And like  What?  Like a couple years, right?  Like you just  Well, yeah  The transformation was amazing  It was like light brown  And I used to have a mustache  And it was pretty much like a mullet  I kind of get it  Another thing that me and Florentine  Have in common  Like when you sort of have red hair  Yeah  My hair was mousier  When I was in college  I think it was college  And I came home  And I decided  Eh, maybe a couple highlights  Yeah  Blonded up a little bit  The look my dad gave me  I never fucking did it again  He looked at me  With such disappointment 
[01:07:30]  Like what the fuck are you doing?  Because he was old school, man  He was Sinatra  Not the Beatles  Yeah  So he didn't get anything  As far as that stuff goes  Yeah, you don't dye your hair  You can wear a wig  That looks like a dead rat  But you don't dye your hair  Well, I went with a couple highlights  Thinking no one will notice  Maybe it's, you know  The sun lightened up to shit  Got rid of some of the mousy red  And man, never again  Yeah, Florentine  But you got the red  Sort of a little red  Yeah, but I was a bleach blonde  For a long time  Then it went like brown  But in the summertime  My hair turns blonde  Even to this day 
[01:08:00]  It does  So as soon as I'm out in the sun  In your one man show  He went from  Ugh  To a gorgeous woman  Like  I went from like a two and a half  To a seven  Yeah  Yeah  Real quick  Like real quick  And then they show photos of him  At rock clubs  And you're like  Who the fuck is that?  He's got the  You know  This t-shirt with the zipper  Going diagonally across  Is there any pictures of this online?  I gotta see it now  And are we putting the bandolier  Versus Florentine's 
[01:08:30]  Maybe purse online  For the polling?  People want to  Want to  Vote there, Sam  Yeah, well  I'm waiting for  Did E-Rock take the pictures?  I'm going to  Alright, we got  We got E-Rock  We got Bob Kelly's bandolier  Versus Jim Florentine's  Sort of  Womanly purse  And we're gonna have the listeners  Vote on which one  It might be a little  What about Rich Voss'  Fucking pocketbook?  Well, I mean  It's a guarantee he would win  Yeah, let's do that  It was between you two today  And then  Then you can take on Voss  For the title 
[01:09:00]  I want to see Florentine  Looking like a  A beautiful woman  A beautiful woman  I don't know if there's anything online  That's too bad  Well, we're  We could do the double topical  So you did the Elvis Costello  E-Rock?  Yeah  I had a whole bunch of other songs  But that was the one I picked  Why Elvis Costello today?  Well, FM Radio was approved by the FCC  51 years ago  Radio  Yeah, okay  And that was that  What was that song?  That was Radio Radio 
[01:09:30]  Radio Radio  Elvis Costello  I hate Elvis Costello  I know I'm pissing off some fans  I never got into him  You know who I didn't get  But I got like three years ago  It was Warren Zevon  I love Warren Zevon  I always say  I was like  Ugh  Werewolves in London  But then  Well, that's the problem was  That's the only song  You know  FM Radio played  Yeah, but he's a genius  Amazing  That last album he made  Was fucking great  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  But Elvis never  You know  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  And playing with Paul McCartney 
[01:10:00]  And I don't know  I don't know  I don't get it  And then you played the Pot song  Because today is what?  April 20th?  420  420  It's the song that Scorch  Used to end every Friday show with  Oh really?  To get everyone ready  For the weekend?  Yeah, that was the big  Weekend kickoff  I'm gonna delete that one then  Why?  Do we really wanna do  What Scorch does?  Every once in a while  I don't care if you  Throw it in there  Okay  You were at the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  There, Florentine  Yeah  Last Saturday night  How'd it go?  Cleveland  Amazing 
[01:10:30]  Why?  No Axl  Didn't need Axl  Beastie Boys  Love the Beastie Boys  Guns N' Roses  And Red Hot Chili Peppers  That's good  That's a great line  Of getting inducted  Of course  It was super long  Like five and a half hours  Oh, fuck that  What do they do  For five and a half hours?  You get bored  You do get bored  I was there with this comic  Chad Zumach  But it sounds like  They're not organized  If it takes five and a half hours  No, it's just a lot of shit  You know, people go up there 
[01:11:00]  Talking and stuff  But we  Me and my buddy Chad  We just found like a side room  Right by the side of the stage  Where all the  Band guys were hanging out  And there was a bar there  An open bar  And we just hung there  And just bobbed everyone  For pictures  Right  And then we knew  The Beastie Boys  Or Chili Peppers  Or Guns were coming out  Then we'd go out  And see it  So for us  It wasn't boring  Right  But we didn't  You know  Guns N' Roses was great  He didn't even went out  Axel there  What's going on  He's checking his Facebook 
[01:11:30]  No, I was trying to find  The picture of you  With hair  It's not on my  Yeah  Do you know what we're  Talking about right now?  Yeah, talking about the  I'll tell you right now  He went to the  Hall of Fame  And he was hanging out  It was really long  Around five hours  But he hung out at this spot  With his other comic  I was just in it  I'm good  I was just trying to find  The photo on the  Interim net  I know you have Sam  That does that  But I was trying to do it too  Alright, so  What were the highlights?  In his hair?  Get it? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah  Well, the Beastie Boys  Didn't play  Why?  Because MCA  He's got cancer  And supposedly he's really sick  Was he there?  No, he wasn't there  Has he been sick  For a long time?  I think so  I'm not  Don't know the whole story  On that  But  He's got  Like he's looked sick  For like ten years  Yeah, so  The other two guys  Were there  And then Kid Rock  And a couple guys  From the Roots  Went up  And did Beastie Boys stuff  And they were great  Oh wow, very cool  The Beastie Boys  Didn't do Beastie Boys stuff?  No, there was only  Two of them there  They didn't want to 
[01:12:30]  Perform it out on MCA  Oh, I see  Fuck that  That happens a lot  With bands  You know  Like Rod Stewart  Wasn't there  The faces got inducted  Stewart wasn't there  So  Why wouldn't Stewart  Go up there?  I don't know exactly  Why he wasn't there  Because Ron Wood was there, right?  Ron Wood was there  He played  But the guy from  So who the fuck is Stewart?  Simply Red maybe  That Huckleberry guy  Or whatever his name is  Oh, with the red hair  With the curls  I think that was the guy  That went up  I don't know  And he did  He sung the faces stuff good  And then  So you  Wait a minute  So you had  The three bands 
[01:13:00]  The Beastie Boys  Didn't perform  With their original members  Guns N' Roses  Didn't perform without Axl  And then you got  The faces  Faces without Rod Stewart  Yeah  This Hall of Fame  Is a disaster, man  It really is  Because there's always  Fighting going on  And there's always  Money issues with the bands  And they don't want to perform  Rod Stewart was sick  That's bullshit  That's the easiest excuse to use  No one's going to  Call you out on that  It sounds like a blast  It sounds like a good time  Sounds like a fuck  Did you have a good time?  Did you fly in for this?  Well, I did some gigs in Cleveland 
[01:13:30]  During the week  Yeah, I love stuff like that  Especially with guns being there  I know those guys  I know Slash and Duff  And Steven Adler  And Steven Adler  Wear that Metal Show t-shirt  Oh, cool  On stage  Which is awesome  But I knew Axl wasn't going to show up  From day one  Axl's got his own thing going on  With his band  It's pretty obvious  And if he's in a room  With those guys  He hasn't seen Slash  Or talked to them  Since 1995  Is that true?  Yeah  Yeah  They haven't even talked  In 17 years  Haven't even talked  That's 17 years  Yeah, 17 years  So there's no way  He's going to be in another 
[01:14:00]  Even just to show up there  I had no idea  Be in a room with Slash  I just assumed over the years  That they talked  But it just never went well  Not even a conversation  I don't  I mean  I  I believe you, man  I believe your shit  Is Steven Adler  Is he sober?  Is he doing good?  Steven Adler's doing good, yeah  Is he?  Because he's  Last time I saw him  He actually was talking normal  Yeah, he's good  He's sober  And he was the happiest guy  In the world to be there  He's always happy  He's the one who really  Wants the guns  Slash and Duff  Don't even care about  A guns reunion at this point  They're doing their own thing 
[01:14:30]  Slash's got a great solo band  And stuff like that  Duff's got his own thing going on  They don't want the aggravation  All the drama  Right  They're older now  You know  They're like  They don't need that shit  But, you know  Steven's the one  In the end  They probably don't even need the money  I mean  They're giving up a lot of money  But they're probably  They're never going to spend  The money they got  The money they made off  Of Appetite for Destruction  The royalties  They still get off of that record  Every time it's played  In a sports arena  On radio  Internet  All of that stuff  They make a fortune  Imagine going to your mailbox  And getting that check  Every month  I was on Law and Order  Holy fuck  And that check is pretty 
[01:15:00]  I got 96 cents  Last week  That's such a  Swear to god  Such an insult  Don't you want to write it back  And go please  Don't even bother  Well, you know  What's so weird  Is that I got a  You make more money  Off of the  Playing somewhere else  Than you actually make  On the original gig  I've made thousands  Of dollars off it  But it slowly dwindles down  Over years  To nothing  To nothing  Yeah, they put their  Crank Angus shit online  I guess  Oh my god  So it was like 16 cents  I got like 40 checks  For like 16 cents  God  And I was like  How do you bring this 
[01:15:30]  To the bank  Right  So I would just do it  Like three at a time  With another big check  So it didn't look  To  Oh, and could you  Catch this  48 cents  Yeah, 48 cents  You should have framed them  That would have been  You should have framed them  That's an insult  Yeah  But anyway  What else about  The Hall of Fame  So, you know  And it was  Red Hot Chili Peppers  Went on last  And after Guns  Went up there  And kicked ass  Miles Kennedy sang  Instead of Axl  He sings at Alter Bridge  And he sings  And slashes solo band 
[01:16:00]  He does  He's unbelievable  He's the guy  Remember when  Plant didn't want  To do Zeppelin  After they did  That reunion show  Right  That one show  Right  And everyone thought  They were going to go on tour  And Plant just said  I'm not doing it  Plant's an asshole  By the way  Yeah, he doesn't  Why is he an asshole?  I met him  I love Zeppelin  He's a dick  He's just a dick  Is he crazy?  You just get that  That feel  Really?  Yeah, yeah  Well, supposedly  Like even in rehearsals  Like him and Paige  Were going at it big time  You know, rehearsing  For that one show  Plant can't hit those 
[01:16:30]  High notes anymore  He doesn't want to  Matters himself  Not even close  So he's not going to  Go on tour  Where everyone's going to  Put it on fucking YouTube  The next day  He's like  Fuck it  I got enough money  I'm not doing it  He's probably smart  Because he's still singing  And he just does it  Differently now  Yeah  He never stopped performing  He's always reinventing himself  Yeah, but you don't  Want to hear that  As a fan either  You don't want to  You don't want to hear  Plant not fucking  Hit the note  True  Try to fucking  Try to play it  In a different way  So who's this other guy  So Miles Kennedy  Miles Kennedy  Miles Kennedy  Actually got the gig 
[01:17:00]  In Zeppelin  If they were going  To move forward  Steven Tyler  Auditioned for Zeppelin  I know  So did Sammy Hagar  Really  But Miles Kennedy  Would have had the gig  If they were going  To move forward  And they just decided  Not to  That's how good  This guy is  Why didn't they  Go for it  I don't know exactly why  I think Paige  Probably just said  You know what  It's not worth it  It's just going to be weird  And those guys  Are getting pretty old  Now too  Yeah  Not in a good way  Some of these guys  Could age well  I don't think  I don't know  If Paige is aging well  No he's definitely not  Yeah 
[01:17:30]  So Miles sang  The Guns N' Roses  Miles sang The Guns  And he tours with  Slash's solo band  And I've seen him live  Yeah  And he's amazing  He does The Guns  Unbelievable  I didn't even know this  I'm going to check this out  He's great man  He's a great singer  Is there any clips  On YouTube  Of him singing  Guns N' Roses  Yeah from the  From the awards  It should be yeah  Oh give me something  They did Mr. Brownstone  They did  Paradise City  And Sweet Child of Mine  Does he sound like Axl  Yeah  Oh good  He could do it  Yeah  Really  Because I usually hate  When the fucking 
[01:18:00]  Right  You know what I was  You know what I didn't think  Guns went on before  Chili Peppers  And I was like  There's no way  I think what Guns did  Because the place went nuts  Even Miles singing  That I said  How are the Chili Peppers  Going to follow Guns  And they did  Of course  And no problem  They were fucking  Of course  Because they're on tour too  So they're  Anthony Keyes  This is ridiculous  The guy  Whoa  The guy kind of looks like  A younger Steven Tyler  Yeah  A little bit  Let me hear a little taste of it  It's a cell phone video  But it's not bad  What a great riff 
[01:18:30]  It's a fucking great song  Oh fuck  The whole album  Is ridiculous  It's not a bad song on it  .  Sweet, you're the one  I'm sorry  But it seems to be  When Miles made a  Childhood  Memories 
[01:19:00]  Where everything  Was a square  Shot  Right over the sky  I was there  And I'd rather see  Her face  She takes me away  It's not bad at all, man.  Right, it's a little different, but that's good. 
[01:19:30]  He's not totally mimicking that.  He looks like the guy, the lead actor in Burn Notice on USA Network.  That's Sega.  Hey, somebody likes Characters Wanted.  Characters Wanted.  Characters Wanted.  You interviewed Axel.  Yeah.  Was he cool to you after he made you wait?  He made you wait how many hours?  Well, the interview was scary.  I was trying to throw some comedy in this fucking goddamn fucking serious interview you're doing. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, well, look, remember when you were talking about the UFC and that this trainer, me and Opie, you're like, what the fuck's he talking about?  We're just going to let him go.  You know what I mean?  I'm going to shut my mouth.  I was like, really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It does blow my mind how much you know about fucking music.  It really does.  There's no reason.  Yeah, but that's just basically having a fucked up childhood and having nothing going on and not getting laid.  So I just would sit in my room and just fucking listen to this shit over and over again.  But this is the question I want to ask today to Florentine. 
[01:20:30]  I assume you just know metal.  Do you know all music?  You don't talk about other music usually.  I know some classic rock, hard rock, metal.  Who's your classic rock bands growing up?  Stones, Boston.  Love Boston.  I saw them before.  Cars.  You like the Cars?  Oh, yeah.  The Cars are great.  Cars are great, yeah.  No, I'm just surprised that you like the Cars.  Foreigner.  I like some Foreigner stuff.  Jukebox Hero?  Journey.  Journey.  Before they were big again.  Do you like Journey with the new lead singer?  Yeah, the Chinese fella. 
[01:21:00]  Is that Chinese?  Filipino.  Filipino.  Filipino, yeah.  He's great, man.  I've seen him twice with him.  He's unbelievable.  You've seen him live?  Yeah.  And they're good, right?  Phenomenal.  He's miserable.  That guy's miserable.  Who?  The lead singer.  The Filipino guy?  He's miserable.  How is he miserable?  Because they signed him to...  He was living in a shantytown and now he's the lead singer of Journey.  Yeah, but they signed him to a shit deal and he's just stuck in it.  Also because he didn't like touring and stuff too in the beginning.  I don't know if it's changed.  Is he really miserable?  Yeah, he was fucking miserable.  Because he's coming in.  And we'll get into it with him. 
[01:21:30]  He's coming in?  I think.  We said yes.  We'll see if it happens.  He goes, so you're miserable?  He goes, no, I love it.  In the beginning he was.  But he saved that band so you think those guys would get together and go, I know we kind  of gave you a shitty deal because we thought you were just kind of a karaoke guy.  But you know what?  Here's a little extra.  You would assume they would do that.  No.  Why are they going to do that?  It's money.  Because those guys would not be doing shit if they didn't find this guy.  Well, they had another singer in there before him and they were still doing okay.  The reason why people love Journey is because anybody can almost sing the songs. 
[01:22:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you sound like shit.  Journey songs are songs you always try to sing.  Yeah, you can always try to sing.  I don't know why.  Can I hear you sing faithfully to me?  Yeah, if we can get it on the air.  I need the music.  I'll sing any Journey song.  You'll sing faithfully?  Any Journey song.  Hold on, hold on, pause, hold on.  Yeah, hold on.  Can we find a karaoke?  Can we karaoke this shit?  Any Journey song I can sing.  How about you give us your favorite?  I know any Journey song.  I love all Journey songs.  But how about... 
[01:22:30]  The dawn by the bay.  No, I want faithfully would be great.  It's so gay.  He's going to be singing a bunch of men.  We need a karaoke track.  Can you put your fucking bodego belt on?  Bodego.  I love that he says it wrong every time.  Now we're getting into some funny.  Woo!  Listen.  See, man, it doesn't always have to be funny.  I don't want it to be funny.  All right.  Sometimes you're just having a conversation.  I'm enjoying this.  Hopefully they enjoy it.  I am enjoying it.  I like it.  We lost a musician overnight.  Who? 
[01:23:00]  Who?  You know the saxophone in Who Could It Be Now?  What?  Men at Work.  Really?  He's dead?  Dead.  You can't...  Dead.  Men at Work is dead to me now, then.  Dead.  I mean, everyone's talking about Levon Helms dying, but we also lost a saxophone guy from  Men at Work.  Dead in his house.  58.  Really?  58?  Oh, my God.  His friends didn't see him for a while, so they did a little knock-a-roo on the door.  That guy. 
[01:23:30]  He's dead.  Dead.  Dead.  Did you like the 80s shit when they got all weird with the New Wave?  I got into the New Wave because I couldn't get pussy-less in the metal.  This is the early 80s before the hair metal, so I had no choice to start getting the New  Wave and going to dance clubs and trying to dance and get laid.  So I went to New Wave for like three years.  I turned my back on metal.  You had a flock of seagulls haircut?  I didn't have the haircut, but I would just know all the songs, and I would go to the  dance club, and I had a dance.  I went there.  Remember when they, I don't know, right at that time, they had roller skating dance clubs? 
[01:24:00]  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just a roller skating rink.  Yeah, I know, but at night it would be like dance club roller skates.  People would dance?  Yeah, it was, I remember, I remember just boogying around on my roller skates, but I  couldn't roller skate real good, like I couldn't go backwards.  Right.  I could only go forwards, and I would do that, the thing where you'd put one leg out and  bring it back, that was my move.  Really?  You'd push the leg out.  So you were hoping like a girl would see that and come over and skate with you? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Did it ever happen?  Obviously, you can't roller skate anymore.  Did you ever get laid roller skating?  Oh, fat joke.  I don't know if that's a fat joke.  That's a fat joke.  No, no.  Why can't I?  Why can't he do it?  Because of the knee thing?  Yeah, what was your...  Don't give him a fucking knee thing.  What was the meaning behind that joke?  What's your meaning?  I'm thinking you went, because he's too old.  I'm not old.  You're as old as you, you're fucking...  No, I'm not too old, because I like to feel like...  I don't know the job.  I like to keep youthful, so I won't go with the old thing. 
[01:25:00]  But we all know you blew out your knee, man.  Okay, that's not a sad joke.  That's some bullshit.  That's not bullshit.  That's the reason why you can't roller skate anymore.  And why do you think he broke his knee?  Thank you.  Why do you think he busted his knee?  That's why Jim's my lawyer.  Was there maybe too much pressure?  No, he cut the wrong way.  As a fat joke, can you not defend me?  Well, I'm trying to delve into his mind to catch him.  No, you went for a cut?  Yes, sir.  When you were running, and you cut too sharply.  That's not what happened.  Why, you saw the ice cream truck? 
[01:25:30]  That's not what happened.  I didn't say that.  Listen to me.  He should be in on the fat joke thing, by the way.  He's done four fat jokes in a row here.  I jumped an inch in the air, and my knee gave out.  I didn't try to cut.  I'm going to fucking T.O.  No, but the roller skating is because you broke your knee, man.  Because you were showing me some movies you used to do.  I'm like, nah, the knee's not going to be able to do that.  Did you have a roller skater?  I know you're a roller skater.  You used to roller skate good, too.  I used to go backwards.  You did.  I was backwards skating.  Yeah, you were the guy that went backwards.  I thought I was cool.  You had your own roller skates. 
[01:26:00]  Hell fucking no.  I was too poor.  No.  Did you ever get laid?  Yeah, I met one of the hottest chicks ever.  The freshest breath ever.  She used to brush her teeth nine times a day.  But I stopped seeing her because she's like, I'm going roller skating on Saturday night.  Want to go?  She was a real professional roller skater.  And I was like, okay.  And I went with her, and she took me to this ghetto, ghetto roller skating ring that was  like a late Saturday night.  It was open late.  It was just all black dudes that could really roller skate with the headbands, and they'd 
[01:26:30]  do flips and tricks.  And she was out there with them, and I was just like, fuck this.  I'm out.  So it was like a racist thing then?  No, it was just fucking, yeah.  It was just like, I got to go.  I can't fucking compete with a black guy with abs and a fucking headband.  I can't flip.  I can't go backwards.  My move was the fucking V.  So you just left her there?  I left.  I was like, I'm going to go.  She was like, but she knew.  She was like, okay.  Like, she understood.  She was like, okay, because I'm not leaving, because I'm having a fantastic time. 
[01:27:00]  You think she just said, okay, because she was like, good, get out of here?  No, because we went together.  She just realized that it was...  And a black guy drove her home?  Yeah, I hope so.  I don't know what happened to her.  She was a gorgeous, beautiful blonde girl, though.  Oh, my God.  Did you bang her?  No, we made out on her couch.  Did you dry hump her?  No, yeah.  Finger popper?  Remember dry humping?  I used to love dry humping.  Dry humping used to rule.  Oh, I love dry humping.  I don't know why, but you used to rule. 
[01:27:30]  I used to love just getting on and rubbing.  You try to rub your cock on their pussy.  Oh, yeah.  And they start...  If you hit the right spot.  But you had to adjust it.  You had to push it up.  You had to push it up.  Before you started dry humping.  You didn't want it squashed down and pointed down.  Yeah, because you hurt your dick.  You always have to turn around for a second and adjust it.  Just tell the chick, oh, is that a guy by the window?  So she looks the other way and then you adjust it real quick.  You had to pop it to the side, away from the zipper.  Yeah.  And then you had to go in on a different angle.  Yeah, you had to get the hardest part of your cock, though, so you didn't fucking... 
[01:28:00]  Like, right under the helmet, that vein shaft that gets real hard when you just rub it on her fucking clit.  If you didn't do it properly, it was a nightmare.  Did you have out of burns the next day?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, it just ripped it apart.  You could feel when you did it properly because you could pop...  You'd feel that little pop on her clit.  Like, it would just bump over the bump and...  Ugh, ugh.  Women love dry humping, too.  They love it more than fucking.  I don't think you could dry hump anymore.  Why?  That's a fat joke.  How is that a fat joke?  You just let me finish. 
[01:28:30]  I'll tell you why.  I don't know.  Was that directed towards you or is he just saying in general?  I don't think Bobby could dry hump anymore.  Why?  Why?  First of all, he...  First of all, shut up!  Shut up!  Is it the knee thing?  Shut up!  You said why and didn't let me finish.  I'll tell you why.  I'm going to tell you why there's a $5 going to that jack.  He didn't tell my face.  He told my stomach.  Did you look nice?  And he was looking at you.  He wasn't looking at both of us, like...  Did you look at his stomach when he said it?  He blew it.  Because it absolutely was going to be a fat joke.  But he stopped me before I was going to go all in.  $2.50. 
[01:29:00]  $2.50.  Well, you might as well put in $5 and finished a joke.  That's fair.  That's fair.  It's the obvious joke.  I can't wait for him.  What were you going to say?  His dick ain't touching anything.  Because of the belly?  $5.  What?  That's $5.  That's $5.  You just said it.  Take the money out, you fucking...  See, the only way he could dry hump the girl would have to be on top.  Not back then.  I was fucking skinny.  Back then I was 14.  I'll say it for Bobby.  Bobby used to be gorgeous.  Yeah, I was hot too, dude.  Back when I was a kid.  Bobby, you were hot.  I got a photo.  Can I show you a photo?  You were so hot that a chick left you at the roller skating rink. 
[01:29:30]  Bobby.  All right.  I didn't say it was black.  How much money is in the fat jar?  There's 15 in the fat jar.  15 bucks in the fat jar today?  Yeah.  And I can't fucking hit one today.  I'm giving that to a fan.  Where were we?  Oh, we're going to do faithfully after the break.  The dry hump and I would always...  Dry hump.  I knew a girl wasn't going to put out second date or something like that.  I always wore tighty-whities just in case I came.  It wouldn't leak.  Never wear boxes when you're going to dry hump.  Because it just stays right in there.  You want to keep it all in. 
[01:30:00]  You want to keep it all in.  And then when you come, you don't tell her.  And then you go, you know, let's...  Anything worse than...  We should just go out Saturday and just leave.  Right.  Smart.  Anything worse than a leaky penis in boxer shorts?  No.  I was never a boxer guy just because of that.  I went boxers for maybe a year when it was all in.  When everyone was wearing boxers.  I...  The fucking boxers suck.  Are you going to sing faithfully for us after the break, Bobby?  You want to see?  I've seen your gorgeous picture.  Look at that.  Look at that.  You're gorgeous. 
[01:30:30]  Who's that?  That's me.  No, it's not.  I swear to God, that's me.  Why are you in a tutu?  That's not you.  That's me.  Get the fuck out of my mouth.  How old?  How old am I in that?  I don't know.  Dude, you have long hair like a girl, too.  Why are you in a tutu?  This explains everything.  Why haven't you ever shown us?  I just got that from my mom last week.  That's not you.  That's me.  Have you tweeted this yet?  Let me see.  Not yet.  I'm going to tweet it.  Let me see.  That can't be you.  Let me go to the next one.  No, I'm making it big so I can see your face.  That's me. 
[01:31:00]  As a little boy.  It's black and white.  He's in a ballerina outfit.  How old do you think he is?  You're eight or nine?  Maybe a little younger.  Seven?  Yeah.  Six, seven.  Six, seven.  Shell Florentine.  Let me see.  Which way am I going?  This way?  Look at me.  That's me sucking my fingers.  Remember I used to tell you I used to suck my fingers?  What's that about?  Let me see.  That's me.  Keep going.  That's me looking a little cowboy bobby.  Cowboy bobby, everyone.  Cowboy bobby.  This means nothing unless you tweet the pictures to the listeners. 
[01:31:30]  I will.  I'm going to tweet.  You've got to do the tutu.  I'm going to who say the tutu right now.  The who say the tutu.  Let me show Jim.  You're going to who say the tutu.  Hey, ready?  Holy fuck.  We also have the poll ready.  Do you want me to send you the link so you can tweet it?  Do we like the picture, though?  It's good enough.  There's no way.  That's a girl.  That's me.  There's no way.  That's me.  I don't even recognize the face.  That's me.  That's a girl.  No, that's me.  That's a girl.  That's me, dude.  Why are you in a tutu?  It was Halloween.  No, it wasn't.  I swear to God.  My mother dressed me up as a girl. 
[01:32:00]  There's a date in the bottom of that picture.  February 2nd.  No, it's got no sleeves on.  It's summer.  It's summer.  It's summer.  That's right.  Because you lived outside of Boston.  No sleeves and you're outside.  There's no way that was Halloween.  October 31st?  October 31st.  Why are you lying to us?  It was Halloween.  No way.  It's not Halloween.  Why did you have the tutu on?  You don't even have shoes on.  There's no way you're outside.  That's Cowboy Bob.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We can only take the first 400 votes on the poll. 
[01:32:30]  Why?  Because otherwise we've got to pay for the service.  I'm not doing that.  So the first 400 people will decide which bag is gayer?  Yeah.  You want me to send you the link so you can tweet it?  Or you want me to tweet it and you just retweet it?  Will I get followers if I mention I'm Opie Radio on Twitter?  Well, you just did it, didn't you?  Oh, so then now I don't have to tweet the picture?  Right.  But they should go to Opie Radio anyway for great stuff?  Right.  All right.  Sam will tweet it.  Okay.  Give fucking Sam a plug today.  Not Sam on Twitter.  Not Sam.  We've got a picture of the two gay things. 
[01:33:00]  The bandolier.  Bobby's bandolier versus Florentine's sort of womanly bag.  And the listeners will decide which is gayer.  Yeah.  And you're also going to tweet the tutu picture.  I'm going to tweet the...  I'm going to who say it.  Who say it.  Yeah, those guys want me on who say.  I don't know what to do with it.  Who say it's good.  I like it.  And when you guys see this on Twitter, tell me if that's a girl or a boy.  And look at the picture because he says it's Halloween when he's barefoot outside with no sleeves.  Why don't you... </pre>
