<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments and punctuated by numerous commercial breaks advertising everything from adult video stores and Delaware Title Loans to  Frugian smoothies, Magna's Irish Cider, HBO/Cinemax, and a Caribbean getaway.  The show began with a lengthy, vulgar discussion about a listener nicknamed "Stalker Patty," detailing her disruptive behavior at a Ron and Fez boxing event, including verbally harassing Ben and Steve, attempting to steal food, and ultimately crying after being confronted.  Callers shared further anecdotes about Patty's unwelcome presence at various events.

This was followed by discussion of the show's "WOW" contest, sponsored by risquevideo.com, featuring listener-submitted photos of women (with some uncertainty regarding the gender of certain contestants).  The hosts and callers debated the quality of the photos, focusing on issues like lighting and posing, and specifically scrutinized a Philadelphia entry whose gender was heavily debated.

A caller shifted the conversation to Phil Mickelson's birthday and the chaotic atmosphere of the US Open, highlighting the crowd's reactions to Sergio Garcia's "yips" and the difficulty of seeing Tiger Woods play.  This transitioned into speculation about Steve Austin's firing from WWE, rumored to be due to a domestic violence incident involving his wife, along with discussions of Austin's unprofessional absences from Raw.  This segment also included a sexually suggestive joke involving various superheroes and the Invisible Man, and a comedic commercial featuring the fictional character "Tippy Tom," a homeless man engaging in various sexual acts.  A scheduled guest appearance by Tracy Morgan was mentioned, but he wasn't present during this segment. Jim Norton was present but mostly silent, unhappy with his coffee.

The show then moved to a discussion about explicit sex scenes in films like *Monster's Ball*, *Wild Things*, *The Getaway*, and *Bound*, with callers debating the hottest scenes and employing graphic language. This was followed by a segment featuring Knuckle Sandwich, a local band attempting to get their song played.  They offered photos of the lead singer's girlfriend, described by callers as looking like Alicia Silverstone, in exchange for airtime.  The hosts commented extensively on the photos, including a visible “camel toe,” and agreed to consider playing the song, contingent on the band developing a suitable on-air segment.  The band's logo, similar to both the Kiss and Krispy Kreme logos, was also discussed.

Tracy Morgan then appeared in the studio, having participated in a celebrity softball game.  The ensuing conversation was dominated by sexually explicit topics, including Morgan's pornography preferences, his son's discovery of his pornographic collection, and humorous, graphic anecdotes about his sexual experiences. This extended into discussions of race, with Morgan teaching Opie and Anthony racial slang, and their respective views of "white boy cool" versus Black culture, often utilizing racial epithets and sexually suggestive language.  Caller Malik participated in this segment. The conversation further covered Morgan's opinions on celebrities like Mike Tyson, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey, with often crude descriptions of their lives,  his experiences with drugs, his views on interracial relationships, and a story about kissing Britney Spears.  The recurring fictional character "Dippy Tom" was also reintroduced.  

The show also featured a phone interview with Chuck Sawyer, creator of the board game "Life is a Black Man," which depicts the challenges faced by a young Black man in America, including racism, crime, and police interactions.  The interview was interrupted by dropped calls. Speculation on Jennifer Lopez and Puff Daddy's relationship, suggested to be a publicity stunt,  and promotion of the "WOW Contest" (with disappointment expressed at the low number of entries), and a Vince McMahon/Ric Flair wrestling match for WWE ownership, highlighting the extreme violence depicted, were also included. The show concluded with listener calls sharing humorous, often crude observations on the topics discussed.  Tracy Morgan promoted his upcoming Comedy Central appearances.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts and guests made extensive use of crude language and sexually suggestive humor.

[00:03:30]  15.  See the USA in your gentleman.  Fake celebration of freedom.  That's why it's freedom of speech.  It's not freedom to say things except stuff that might offend people. 
[00:04:00]  It's freedom to say horrible things.  Sometimes it's clever and funny and other times it's downright disgusting and offensive.  Opie and Anthony making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea.  We're a virus, virus, virus.  You want to hear a joke?  Oh, a joke.  A little comedy.  It might be it.  It's a guy joke.  Uh-oh. 
[00:04:30]  Are there dirty words in it?  You can't say dirty words.  All right.  Wonder Woman.  Wonder Woman was on the beach with her legs.  I know this joke.  What are you opening up for Vos?  In four Fantastics, Superman saw Wonder Woman, and he flew down and did a little thing.  He died in.  And then, uh, uh, uh, Hulk Cozen, he went down there. 
[00:05:00]  Who?  He did it.  Who?  Oh, the Hulk.  Oh, the Hulk.  The Hulk.  He did a little bit with Wonder Woman.  And then the Rock Man, he comes down, he did his thing.  Well, anyway, they all go back.  Wait, what's the thing they're doing?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me get through this joke.  And they all get back to the fort.  And the Invisible Man shows up and says, my ass is sore as hell. 
[00:05:30]  Somehow it's so much funnier when you tell it.  I'm a faggot. 
[00:06:00]  I was a faggot two years old.  You don't die of AIDS!  Now, you don't like twins, so what are you saying?  Our new friend, Tippy Tom. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  The homeless faggot.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, including...  Uh-huh.  Seattle.  Back on in Seattle at the buzz.  Hi, Seattle.  866-277-4-WOW.  866-277-4-WOW. 
[00:07:00]  I'm a god-damned mess today.  Listen to this voice.  Listen to this crap.  Ugh.  Anthony, very under the weather.  And a sore throat.  I think you got the strap.  Hmm.  I'm driving in today.  I start, like, one of those hacking coughs, and my voice just disappeared.  Just went like that.  You have the same voice when we talk to Mr. Scooby-Doo?  Hey, Mr. Do. 
[00:07:30]  Nah.  Mr. Do.  Ugh.  So I'm a complete waste today.  A waste.  We'll be fine, though.  We got lots to do.  Thank God.  Lots and lots of things to get to today.  Right off the bat, though, I think we got to go to Ashman.  And he wants to say something about Ben.  And I got a report on this on Friday.  I got some info, too.  And believe it or not, I was not happy about it.  And I'll explain my side of it in a minute.  Oh, really?  You want to hear?  Oh, sorry about that.  Let's go to Ashman on line one. 
[00:08:00]  Ashman!  How you doing, guys?  What's going on, bro?  Oh, my God.  Friday night, Ben, I literally thought he was going to lose his effing mind.  We were at the Ron and Fez thing, you know, the boxing match.  Yeah, Ron and Fez did a boxing thing after us here in New York City.  And I heard it was a huge event.  A lot of listeners went down and checked it out.  It was a great event.  Everybody had a great time.  You know, the fight was over.  Crowds started breaking up.  And me and a couple of guys, Dinky, Ben, Steve was there.  And I turned around and I see Stalker Patty standing right over there. 
[00:08:30]  And I turned to Ben.  I said, Ben, you know, Stalker Patty's right over there.  What is she doing over here?  He's like, where, where, where?  And I said, well, I pointed right at her.  He's like, right over there.  Ben got this glazed look like a shark going after fresh meat.  Yeah.  I swear to God, he went over there like a shark with Stinky and Steve in tow, surrounded her.  And, my God, the beratement began.  It was hysterical. 
[00:09:00]  They were yelling at her to leave.  Yeah.  Is what I think.  Yes, they were.  Get out of here, you waste, you're a piece of crap, just leave.  You're not even supposed to be at any of these events.  You suck, get a life, get out of here.  Why don't you just F off and die, walk in front of a bus.  Yeah, all that was being said.  You saw all this?  Yes, I did.  I didn't see this part, Opie.  I did.  I saw the whole thing.  Yeah.  Well, and then Ben and Steve, they had to call me and they were laughing hysterically.  They thought they were doing such a great thing, making Patty cry. 
[00:09:30]  And, like, leave her alone.  Because if anything happens to that girl, they're coming after me, not you guys.  Well, as I was.  Because all the crap I went through with her.  As I was walking in to the place.  It should be noted that Patty's still hanging around.  Oh, yeah.  All those people out there that thought there would be some kind of effect on her after we did the wig thing.  No.  No.  It didn't faze her.  She continued, you know, going to our events and other people's events.  But, guys.  And she's still around.  Yes, Ashman.  Before the event even started, she was hanging out inside of Hooters. 
[00:10:00]  And one of the waitresses came by with a plate of wings for, you know, someone's order.  And she thought it was a free tray of Hooters.  I thought of plucking wings off the goddamn tray.  And I started eating it.  I'm like, what are you doing?  She is a complete, effing idiot.  What, that was someone's order?  Yeah.  And the waitress walks away, puts the order for the guy who obviously ordered it.  I'm like, oh, my God.  That's hysterical.  Oh.  Yeah.  Patty is an idiot.  She has no clue what she's doing. 
[00:10:30]  I also heard that Ben and Steve kind of threw her out of there because she was hanging out at the table up top that, you know, Ron and Fez sit at and other people from the two shows sit at so people can come up and get stuff signed and just hang out.  It's kind of an area away from everybody.  And Patty just decides, you know, she's going to now just take up residence there and sit down and start just chewing everybody's ear off with her name, Babel. 
[00:11:00]  So, uh, as I'm walking in, Patty's crying.  She's by the front door.  She goes, Steve, and Ben told me I got to leave.  Oh, he was right behind.  I saw this whole thing.  Yeah, so I was just looking at her.  I was like, I got to deal with her, the first effing thing.  This is what drives us crazy that we've been talking about.  Why do I have to then deal with this stupid ass?  So I just said, look, Patty, you stay.  I'm like, I don't care.  But they're going to throw me.  I go, I'll talk to them.  Don't worry.  They won't throw you out again. 
[00:11:30]  I go, stay.  But leave everybody alone.  If you want to hang out, just hang out.  But don't bug people.  So that's the last I heard of it.  I guess she got to stay, and she didn't go back up top.  Yeah, she kind of disappeared after that.  I really didn't see her after that whole thing.  Well, Ben, what do you have to say?  Nothing, dude.  She just doesn't work at the radio station.  She doesn't need to.  At that table, there wasn't even enough seats for people to work at the radio station.  Steve was there.  Stinky was there.  Mark was there.  We were all there.  We didn't have room to sit, and she sits there.  There's food come by.  She's just grabbing it.  It's just, you know, it's crap. 
[00:12:00]  It's annoying.  She's annoying.  She doesn't work at the radio station.  She's still around.  She just drives us crazy.  We had it.  And, you know, I'm not the only one that was involved in this thing, too.  There's the likes of Steve and Mark.  And Steve probably had a few in them, which is never good.  That's never good when Steve gets a little drunk.  I was lucid and remember completely the event.  I remember being very irate when I saw Patty, just because she was sort of sitting there like, 
[00:12:30]  as Ben and Aspen are describing, she's grabbing food and talking everybody's ear off,  and everybody's sort of looking around, including Ronnie and Fezzy,  just looking and going, oh, great.  What the hell is she doing here?  Yeah, what the hell is she doing here?  Someone's got to deal with her.  So Ben and I just start screaming, get out.  You stand, like, pointing.  You, Patty, move.  Get over there.  Do whatever you've got to do, but just don't be here.  And she just, you know, got up, you know, with her little cane and hobbled away.  I don't quite frankly care if she was crying or got hit by a bus.  Go away. 
[00:13:00]  She does do that, though.  She starts picking up.  Like the Hooters waitresses, they got their trays full that they're bringing from the kitchen to paying customers.  And Patty just thinks, you know, she thinks it's one of those cocktail party movies.  Well, oh, thank you very much.  I'll take one of these.  Oh, thank you.  More champagne.  Okay, the bubbles tickle my nose.  I don't feel under there, no, I heard.  All this compassion for this bag lady is coming from.  Well, I caught crap from Steve, too, because I walked up.  I go, Patty was crying by the front door.  I told her, you know, I know you guys chased her out. 
[00:13:30]  I personally don't care.  But I told her, you know, she could just hang out.  And Steve's like, what's with this compassion crap out of you?  He goes, you've got to get rid of that side of you.  Oh, not with everybody, just her.  Steve had a couple in them.  Well, it's pretty funny.  Like maybe four Bloody Marys.  All I want to say is if Patty kills herself in the next few days, it's not my problem.  It's because of what you guys do.  Absolutely not.  I accept absolutely no responsibility for that homeless woman killing herself.  I'm just saying, if she does, people are going to come after me because they're going to remember the last thing on the show. 
[00:14:00]  And that was me yelling, take the wig, take the wig.  But now I'm saying you guys made her cry.  So now if she kills herself, it's your fault, not mine.  Thank you.  It's our fault that she got a reality check and she sits at a table.  There wasn't enough room for other people.  She didn't get a reality check.  She still hangs out with everybody.  See, that's what people don't understand.  People just think that, you know, they don't realize that she's everywhere.  She drives us all nuts.  She doesn't shut up.  You know, she can't talk about anything.  She has no life outside of this radio station.  All she wants to talk about is stuff at the radio station. 
[00:14:30]  And it's just a pain.  It's just enough.  You know, it was really funny.  You know, Billy from Ron and Fez's show, he lost a bet, had to shave his head.  So he's got this really ridiculous looking big hair 80s wig.  And they're standing in front of the ring before the fight starts.  They reenacted the entire Patty incident with Billy grabbing it, yelling, no, I don't want  them to see me like this.  And Ron and Fez pulling the wig off his head. 
[00:15:00]  The crowd went wild.  And then they finally rip it off, and Billy's got both hands over his head going, people  are looking at me.  It was so goddamn funny.  A reenactment of the actual event was hysterical.  Hey, Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, radio gods?  Listen, I was there, and I got to tell you, Patty was looking around.  It was like she was a lost puppy looking for somebody to talk to.  And I turned over, and I saw one of my friends going, is that's Dr. Patty? 
[00:15:30]  And he said, do not talk to her.  She will talk your ear off.  She will not shut up.  And she was like trying to go inside and like, you know, see what she can mooch off of people.  It was ridiculous.  And she mooches off everybody.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my.  She looks so pathetic.  It was ridiculous.  No, she's not as pathetic as you think.  She knows how to work Aunt Nye.  She knows how to work the staff here at NAW.  She knows how to work our listeners big time.  Well, you know what?  She doesn't know anymore, so we're learning real fast.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Talk to you later, guys. 
[00:16:00]  I know Patty still has the cane.  That I don't understand.  There are people that have this surgery that she had, I don't know, how long ago is it now?  A long time.  Where they are able to walk fine within days.  And, of course, within weeks, you can walk fine.  It's not this major surgery.  Jesus Christ.  And she's still using the cane and limping.  She does it for sympathy.  And she does it to get free stuff.  And so people feel bad for her.  She's a disgrace. 
[00:16:30]  John wants to defend Patty.  Here we go again talking about Stalker Patty.  Yes, John.  It's just a quick thing.  But in her defense, for one, there was actually guys going around with giant trays of wings offering them to people.  And this is Patty we're talking about.  We have to say that she knows the difference between the free stuff and the not-so-free stuff.  All right.  Otherwise, you...  I saw someone actually bite into her arm thinking it was a chicken wing.  At one point, that little nasty arm of hers.  Well, when Steve called all drunk, I think it was... 
[00:17:00]  And all giggly on my cell phone laughing.  We just made Patty cry and leave the place.  I was actually feeling a little bit for Patty.  I've got to be honest, because I know how brutal Ben and Steve can get when they're drunk.  And Psycho Mark was there, too.  The trifecta.  I was cringing, because I know how bad these guys can get.  And Mark was way out of...  I mean, he was just out of control, screaming at her.  And Diane Marion, he was relentless.  Going off on those two, because the retarded Laverne and Shirley were there. 
[00:17:30]  I was a little pissed at Lady Dump.  Lady Douche.  She's there.  You know, she wants to enjoy the limelight a little bit.  We have a lot of similar fans, the Ron and Fez show and our show.  We share a lot of audience, and that's a great thing.  So she figures she's going to go down there.  Lady Di, not Marion.  Marion earns her keep.  This was all after our show Friday, right?  Yeah.  Lady Di figures she's going to bask in a little bit of the glory.  And at one point, I said, Lady Di, get over here.  I had a Sharpie in my hand. 
[00:18:00]  And I go, let me draw that goddamn Oliver Hardy mustache on you.  You know?  And I go, if I can draw the mustache on you, believe me, you'll have a place on the show.  I want you to walk around here with that mustache permanently on her face with the marker.  No.  No.  And everyone in the crowd is just chanting, draw it on, draw it on, you know.  And no, no, she walked away.  And then they saw the F and C chant, which was really funny.  Fat C chant.  You never want that chant.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  The best was, though, Marion trying to come back on Mark.  She's like, why don't you go smoke some pot?  Yeah.  Why don't you go smoke some pot?  I will.  And Mark's like, hey, that's a good idea.  I'll be right back.  Actually, I think you said something.  I think I smoked too much already because I'm seeing Martians, you freak.  He calls her a Martian.  All right.  He calls her a Martian.  Hysterical.  Classic.  All right, we'll move on.  But that's what happened Friday after the show to Patty.  Barry, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  How you doing? 
[00:19:00]  All right.  Just wanted to let you know, even though it's a Monday, I got finally my second wow in over  three years.  Congrats, dude.  It doesn't matter if it happened on a Monday.  At this point, it's whip them out whenever.  If you have the wow on your car and the girls feel like flesh, then they're going to do it.  They don't have to wait for Wednesday anymore.  Absolutely.  And I wish more of them knew that.  It was 1130 this morning, just in case she's listening in the white car, turnpike north.  I'm a truck driver.  All right.  And just so she knows, I know you always tell the ladies this.  I wasn't following her, but we were getting off at the same exit. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, okay.  And I didn't want to make it look like I was trying to catch her.  That's a good thing.  Thank you, Barry.  Thank you, gentlemen.  All right.  And we're sending out wow stickers all the time for the New York area.  You just sent a self-addressed stamped envelope, and we send out the wow stickers.  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  And that address is up on opandanthony.com.  You were saying today, Ann, you're seeing a lot of wow stickers out there, huh?  Yeah.  More than ever?  I think more than I've ever seen.  Really, it's cool, you know?  Driving in, there's the wow stickers on everything.  Cars, trucks.  It's amazing.  I think we should segue into the wow contest. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Our wow contest blows.  Now, it blows.  I'm not going to agree with you.  Go to opandanthony.com right now and check out the contestants.  I'm not going to agree with you.

They're giving us $5,000 cash in to give to the best wow.  Dude, there are some hot girls on this.  Well, go back.  Go to the site.  Wait, is that a new girl? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Where?  Which one?  The new girl from Philly is interesting.  Okay.  All right.  Go back to the main page.  So far, we got, what, about 12 contestants?  We need a lot more contestants.  Basically, go to opandanthony.com for all the rules.

We'll put them up on opandanthony.com, and then the listeners eventually will vote on the  best wow for that $5,000.  Yes, Anthony.  There's some really hot ones up there.  I cannot tell you how many emails I read today before the show. 
[00:21:00]  There are a lot of people convinced that one of the contestants, that's all I'm going to  say, because I don't want to blow up anyone's spot, that one of the contestants, most of  our listeners are convinced, is either a man or was a man.  Was a man.  Yeah.  All right.  And I don't get what goes on in that lady's, lady or, or this guy's head, where he's naked  or she's naked in front of the window, the mirror at her house, and, and, and this person's  thinking, I should be in the wow contest. 
[00:21:30]  Lauren, what do you think?  You've had experience with this man.  Look at the, look at the hands.  You know what it tells me?  It's the legs.  Look at the hands.  That looks like a guy, it's the legs, not the hands.  Those are guy legs.  Yeah.  And you know, look at the hips.  They're not really that hip woman thing.  Anthony.  The breasts kind of look.  Anthony, the email off the hook.  Hundreds of email, emails, guys and girls convinced that that contestant that we're all looking  at is actually a man or was a man.  That's from Philly?  Yeah.  Wow.  Dude, we're not giving out the person, you idiot.  You just narrowed it way down. 
[00:22:00]  Wow.  Wow.  So maybe this person wants to confess to something today.  I don't know.  Because I'm not blowing up anyone's spot today.  He's got my vote.  Huh?  You like it.  Just respect it.  You twisted man.  Huh?  Yeah.  So ladies, it's not too late to qualify for the WOW Contest.  Yeah, help us out.  You just got to show up at the station.  We want more ladies to show up here in New York. 
[00:22:30]  We had a nice looking lady on Friday that we didn't get to talk to, Diana.  So if ladies want to come down today, we'll take your photos here in New York, okay?  I don't think Rick did her justice.  Who, Diana?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Are you saying reshoot?  I don't know.  I'm just saying like she looked a lot better standing there as she was taking the pictures  when I was walking by.  I took like a quick look and it looked better than her pictures came in.  I was telling Rick in the back office he has to relax with some of these ladies because  Rick is very experienced with the camera at this point. 
[00:23:00]  He's been the photographer for all these contests for a few years now.  And he's got some complicated poses.  And not all the ladies can pull these poses off.  Oh, he'll stand there for like three minutes at a clip sometimes just going, okay, a little  more head.  Right, right, right.  I'll bend down.  I'm going to, all right.  And then he walks over and like grabs their chin and moves their head.  Like, Rick, you're a tool, man.  He's the best.  He takes it very seriously, so.  Yes.  Yeah, because if they come out bad, you guys complain.  Of course.  Of course we do. 
[00:23:30]  The lighting on her is horrendous.  Dude, she's got all white skin.  Yeah, so you know you've got to do something else.  Yeah, I don't think her shots came out as good as they could.  The lighting on her is like an operating room or something.  Yeah.  Sometimes you just don't have as much to work with.  Oh.  What are you saying?  Oh, what are you saying?  I thought she was lovely.  What are you saying there, Rick?  She's a cute girl.  What are you saying?  Between one and...  Sometimes the camera can't hide certain things. 
[00:24:00]  Not Mr. Rick quality.  Do we have to play the between one and ten game?  He said five.  You said five?  I never said five.  I would never be that gracious and say that much.  There is no way.  See, here's what I'm talking about.  I'm looking at one of her pictures.  There's no way that it should be so white in some of these pictures that it's like completely white.  Right.  It's almost overexposed.  I mean, I even darkened the room there because every time I took a shot of her, I took a lot of shots because her skin is so white.  I mean, the light reflected so much. 
[00:24:30]  We need our red filter gels on the lights.  What is happening with Sacramento in this contest, Anthony?  They represent very well in the 90-90 contest.  We have one girl so far from Sacramento.  We're all looking forward to the Sacramento talent once again.  Yes.  And I must say, the lighting in Sacramento.  Beautiful.  She's got like a golden bronze kind of color to her.  Now, Joanne has a question.  Joanne.  Hi.  What's up?  I'm in Delaware, and I wanted to find out if I could send a picture in rather than going to Philly. 
[00:25:00]  Ben and everyone else is shaking their heads going, no.  Yeah.  No.  We've got to make sure you're of age and all that.  Oh, I'm of age, of course.  I'm sure you are, but the stupid lawyers.  Even though my husband will kill me, but I've got 42 triple Ds.  Yeah.  All right, Joanne.  All right.  Well, if you want to send it just for the hell of it, we'll put it up on foundrymusic.com.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, why don't we break, and we'll continue.  We have a great show today.  We've got Tracy Morgan coming in for the first time ever, Anthony.  Our new friend that we met at the Celebrity Softball game. 
[00:25:30]  Tracy Morgan.  The guy is off the hook funny.  He's beyond funny.  We'll have some fun with him.  What time is he getting here, Rick?  About 4.30.  4.30, okay.  Come here whenever I can.  You're going to have to wait.  Also, we're going to talk to Chuck Sawyer.  He has the Black Man Game.  I've been looking at this for a while now, and I can't figure it out.  The Black Man Game?  It's the Black Man Game.  And what's the little selling point on it underneath the title of the game?  It says, Experience the Black Man's Pursuit of Freedom. 
[00:26:00]  It's a game, board game.  It's made by a black guy, and it's supposed to be able to make you experience what it's  like to be a black man in America.  Okay, terrific.  And I think Jim Norton's here today.  So cranky today.  Yeah.  There he is.  Dude, he's sick.  You're cranky, and we're on in Seattle again.  If I keep talking like this, Paul Mercurio's going to tell me to put my goddamn clothes back on.  Hi.  Why are you cranky? 
[00:26:30]  I just, uh, my coffee was wrong, and the guy got it.  He didn't.  Hold on.  I have such, I really am.  Hold on.  What is wrong with everybody?  Stop.  Anthony called me a C-word.  I had to call him a C-word.  He's whining about his coffee.  I have such a hatred for everything but Starbucks now.  I can't drink baggity little, it tastes like water, and it makes me angry that somebody  sold this and went, Aaron, enjoy.  That's why I hate it.  You wanted him to go to that coffee joint.  I'm not mad at that.  It's my own.  I'm just annoyed. 
[00:27:00]  Mine's fine.  I just hate bad iced coffee.  It bugs me.  It's such a simple thing.  I don't drink.  I don't do dope.  All I want is a nice cup of coffee that's very strong and keeps me peppy.  Right.  I'm sitting here with a throat like Babe Ruth's at the end.  Oh, hell.  You're complaining about coffee.  Go find some brewer bits.  We're going home early today.  Nah, we're going to have fun, so.  Anthony, tippy-tom, as we go to break.  Yes, yes.  He's got a new out-call service.  Oh, he does?  Yeah, he's going to, like, go back into that hook-in thing. 
[00:27:30]  And he's got a little phone number and business here.  And here's the commercial.  If you want my body and you think I'm sexy, come on, baby, let me know.  Lonely?  You're damn right.

[00:39:30]  I'm fine.  Anthony's sick.  And Jim Norton is miserable.  I'm a mess.  It's a formula for a great radio show today.  I got some voice cranking on me today.  Hang in there.  Let's go to the phones.  Talk to Ed.  What's up, Ed?  I was in the U.S. Open this weekend, and it made me think about the WOW Contest. 
[00:40:00]  Phil Bickleton had quite a set of hooters on him, and I thought maybe he should enter.  Yeah, I think he should enter our next man-boob contest.  Yeah.  I was feeling bad for the guy, man.  Well, the guy lost a lot of weight, I guess.  Is that what's going on there?  Yeah, and he's got the leftover big man-boobs.  But they showed him jogging to one of the greens.  I was horrified.  It looked like, I swear to God, I wanted to get the clip of it to play in slow motion, 
[00:40:30]  and play the Baywatch music behind it.  Look, they were bouncing, one, the other.  He needs a bro, Jerry.  He needs a bro.  Big, huge cans the guys got, and they were just flapping.  And he was wearing a shirt, too, that really showed him off.  Doesn't he look a little slow, too?  He's just not quite all there.  He's just always happy to come in second.  Yeah, well, I guess what you're playing.  He's a little too happy to keep coming in second.  When you're playing against Tiger, what else are you going to do?  You know, you've got to resign yourself to the fact that you're coming in second. 
[00:41:00]  What about that Garcia guy?  Now, that was hysterical.  New York fans are effing brutal.  And I've got to tell you, I was at the U.S. Open yesterday, so I have some observations,  and one of them is the Sergio Garcia, who choked bad yesterday.  Well, I think the people have a lot to do with that, the New York fans,  is because this guy, he will stand there before he tees off and eff with his club  to the point where the people start yelling at him. 
[00:41:30]  Well, they start counting, which is hilarious.  Yeah.  I saw them do it, about a thousand people, because he does that little, I don't even know  what you call it.  He grabs the grips.  It's a nervous, like, what is it called, though?  All I can describe to the people listening, he grabs the grip of his club,  and he'll give the club a little shake, he'll step a couple of times with his feet real quick,  and then he'll loosen up his grip and grip it again.  It's a yip.  It's a what?  Yip.  They call it a yip? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, like, some guys, they can't putt anymore because they can't hold their hands still,  because they get the yips.  I don't think he's got the yips, though.  That's what it is.  Does he?  Like, you need to do something to concentrate.  Oh, that's what he was doing, like, to concentrate.  It's like a nervous twitch, is what it is.  It's like some weird twitch thing.  But he does it time and time again.  He'll loosen his grip.  Like Chuck Knoblock, right, before he would put it in.  He'll loosen his grip, and then he'll grip again.  He'll move the club just a little bit.  But then he moves it over.  Step his feet, and then he'll move it over, and then he'll loosen his grip and grip again.  Loosen and grip, loosen and grip, loosen and grip.  And you're watching, going, Jesus Christ, come on. 
[00:42:30]  And then people start counting when he loosens and grips again.  I was out there.  One, two, and you see him.  He looks off, and he gets so pissed off.  Of course.  But he doesn't want to, because he kind of said some stuff to the crowd earlier in the week,  and he realized that was the biggest mistake to do to a New York, you know, crowd.  Yeah.  So, like yesterday, he was just biting his lip, looking up, going, ugh.  And they just count.  One, two.  Like, thousands of people just saying that.  Yeah.  And the marshals are trying to shut people up, but it's just not working. 
[00:43:00]  And they're not shutting up.  No.  Those golf fans, and they get rowdy.  Golf fans are completely different now than they used to be.  Well, first of all, there's a hell of a lot more of them.  Well, they said this was one of the craziest crowds ever in golf history.  Remember the crowd in the audience of, what the hell was that movie that came out?  Happy Gilmore.  Happy Gilmore.  Remember that?  It's pretty much getting like that now.  It's getting there, because golf is becoming very mainstream.  A lot of people are into golf now because of Tiger Woods. 
[00:43:30]  You know, you've got to give it to the guy.  They love their beer, too.  Yeah.  Holy ass.  So, now it's more of a respect to the sport.  You know, flags and stuff of countries.  Yeah.  And it was funny.  I was out there yesterday, and I was out there for about four hours, and then it got  to the point, I'm like, you know what?  What am I doing?  I want to go home and watch this.  You can't watch the game.  No, because what you see on TV, you know, well, I should start by saying this.  Wherever you went, people wanted to see Tiger Woods.  It was all about Tiger.  Did you see him putting over there? 
[00:44:00]  I hear he's over here.  I hear his girlfriend's this.  Wherever you walked, the talk was about Tiger Woods, okay?  And then you hear people going, they're looking at their little brochure for the day, and  they're like, yeah, I think I'm going to follow Tiger Woods around for the front nine, and  then we'll go to the 18th and get a nice spot near the green on the 18th.  Dude, you can't follow Tiger Woods around.  Let me explain what happens, because we did this.  You have to find a spot close enough to the fairway, if you're lucky, to be in the front  row, because if you're two, three people back, you're not seeing anything. 
[00:44:30]  You don't see anybody.  So you've got to try to find a spot somewhere along the hole next to the fairway, plant yourself  there for an hour, for an hour, to watch Tiger Woods walk by.  Walk by.  And maybe, maybe you get a good angle of him hitting it toward the green.  That's it.  But you've got to figure out, like, about where his drive's going to be.  But there are people out there smarter than you, and they've already figured that out,  and they got that spot already.  See, when you watch on TV, you just assume these people are kind of following along. 
[00:45:00]  You know, those people that watch golf on TV, they're watching the big stars hit maybe  two or three shots.  That's it.  That's it.  That is it.  Because if you're at the first hole, they're all at the second, third, fourth, they're  just waiting for him to show up there.  People planted themselves at the 18th hole for five, six straight hours just to watch  Tiger Woods putt out.  That's all they saw.  You know, well, I mean, they saw everyone else come through, but as far as watching Tiger  Woods play golf, you're lucky to see him for one hole.  That's it.  And most of that hole, your angle's not that good. 
[00:45:30]  And that's it.  Why bother?  Watch it at home.  And the surge of the fans as Tiger's coming through, it's just off the hook.  It's ridiculous.  Tiger.  I mean, everyone else, even Phil Mickelson, eh, not much of a crowd.  I mean, Tiger Woods had well over 100 people following him along the course.  His peeps.  His peeps, bodyguards, state troopers, his girlfriend, family members, the media, just 
[00:46:00]  well over 100.  I was trying to count.  I just couldn't count that fast by the time they all swept by.  Crazy.  Absolutely crazy.  Well, he's the man.  So I was out there, like, Tiger came through.  I watched him on the first hole.  And then I kind of ran, you know, to, like, I think the third.  And at that point, I'm like, there's no way I'm going to get close again to see him swing  or do anything.  So at that point, I'm like, you know what?  I'm going home.  Screw it.  But Phil Mickelson, it was his birthday yesterday. 
[00:46:30]  As he's walking the course, every 100 yards, thousands of people singing him happy birthday.  Thinking they were the originals, you know, that they're coming up with something different  than everyone else.  Even though the crowd 100 yards prior already sang the happy birthday.  So every hole he had to hear happy birthday, the whole song, at least three or four times.  I wish a black guy would go after those golf fans with kerosene and guns.  What a bunch of dorks.  White people are going to burn tonight.  Basketball fans set cars on fire and soccer fans riot and golf fans sing happy birthday 
[00:47:00]  and count one, two.  What a bunch of nerds.  They were pretty rowdy out there.  They're not rowdy.  And then it rained and it turned into a nice wet t-shirt contest for everybody.  Compared to other sports, no, not rowdy.  But when you look back at the tradition of golf and the people that usually used to go to golf  games, it's come a long way.  They'd all sit there in the galleries.  Wonderful shot.  Now they're drinking, they're yelling.  Well, they're younger. 
[00:47:30]  Let's go with Giovanni.  They're younger people.  Yeah.  Giovanni, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  A friend of mine, he gets tickets to the Buick Classic up in Westchester all the time.  So we went there and about two years ago, Tiger was finally playing it.  You know, he's sponsored by Buick.  And you end up watching them and you end up racing people to other holes.  Like you're on three, Tiger will go by and you hear the guy next to you go,  okay, we're going to four.  That means you've got to get to five because everyone else is going to four.  But they're already at five.  That's what I was trying to say.  I know. 
[00:48:00]  Crazy.  If you're lucky, you get to see him walk by and maybe do a shot.  That is it.  If you want the best way to do it, you've got to see him tee off and then you've got  to run to a green to watch him putt.  He is amazing, though.  Watching him tee off is crazy.  I think if you want to do it the right way, you watch him tee off on one and then run  all the way to the sixth green.  Hoping that people aren't camped out there already because it's going to be at least an  hour and a half, two hours before he gets to the sixth.  And then when he leaves the sixth green, then you should just run right to like 15 or 16. 
[00:48:30]  Or maybe you could just wait outside the Dakota for him and ask him to sign Catcher in the  Rye.  Enough with Tiger Woods.  It was pretty amazing just to watch him walk by once, though.  It was incredible.  I met him.  I like Tiger Woods.  Because, I mean, everyone was there to see Tiger Woods.  Every single person.  No, I want to go.  All right.  I came to a show in Vegas.  Hello, who's this?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Patty? 
[00:49:00]  I can't laugh.  Brian, what's going on?  Brian?  Yeah.  What's up, bro?  Yeah, that thing that Garcia does?  Yeah.  It's called a waggle.  They call it a waggle?  Oh, the waggle.  Yeah.  Well, he's driving everyone nuts.  Yeah, I know.  He does it forever.  It's like 30, 40 seconds before each shot.  Right.  Hey, Norton.  What's that?  I'll cheer you up, but you've got to make sure you give me a tussle when I'm done. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  Later, boys.  Well, how's he going to cheer you up?  How's he going to cheer me up?  I don't know.  Oh.  A waggle.  Oh, he's waggling that one.  Kyle, what's up?  Golf stinks.  No, the commentators weren't even cool about it.  They were just like, enough.  Enough with whatever they were calling it.  Stop.  You're driving everyone nuts.  It's just awful.  The way he golfs.  They basically said he has a problem.  Plus, dude, you've played some golf. 
[00:50:00]  The guy takes forever to hit the ball.  He does.  Forever.  I know.  I'm standing there watching.  And then he does the last one where he'll loosen his grip.  And then right when he grips, wham, he just swings the goddamn thing when he finally  decides to swing.  And yeah, when you're playing behind people like that, it drives you crazy.  It's like a nervous Tourette's ticker or something.  Yeah.  Kyle, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  I don't know if you heard about Steve Austin.  I'm hearing things.  What's the official word on this?  Supposedly beat up his wife, Debra?  Yeah.  It's happened more than once, she said. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah?  Because about Saturday night, he left.  They're like, I guess he's fired now.  That's what they said.  But he went home and he supposedly beat the crap out of her.  Wait.  Ran off.  What do you mean Austin's fired?  They fired him.  Because last Monday, he was supposed to wrestle and he left.  And Saturday night, they had some show talking about how they're not woken him back.  They're not going to just fire Stone Cold.  Yeah, he's gone.  I kind of saw something like that.  Someone sent me a link to one of the wrestling sites.  I think even WWE's site. 
[00:51:00]  Really?  That he's fired, yeah.  And not like a wacky, you know, kind of wrestling thing.  So what's the story?  Does anyone know?  Yeah, supposedly he wouldn't work Monday night and he just left without telling anybody.  But for what reason?  He just wanted to leave.  So there's got to be more to this than that that's out there.  Well, the story goes as far as Deborah, 4 a.m., she calls the cops.  She was beat up.  Supposedly she's got like some black eyes and, I don't know, some other bruises. 
[00:51:30]  And he took off and then the cops called the cell phone and said, get back to the house.  We want to, you know, talk about what happened over here.  And he refused to go back and now they're looking for him?  Yeah.  Huh.  But, yeah, he's fired.  Here's the story I got.  March 18th, this is a while back, the day after WrestleMania, without company approval and without notice, Stone Cold Steve Austin walked off the job, failed to appear at WWE's Raw show in Montreal.  Stone Cold Steve Austin was advised by WWE management.  This was unprofessional, unacceptable. 
[00:52:00]  After a two-week hiatus, Austin returned to work.  Then on Monday, June 10th, I guess it was last week, Stone Cold Steve Austin again failed to appear for the scheduled Raw event in Atlanta, instead choosing to return home to San Antonio without notice, without company approval.  Although Steve was unhappy with his character's creative direction, Steve made the personal and unprofessional decision not to report to work to address his concerns.  Therefore, Stone Cold Steve Austin is no longer an active member of WWE's talent roster.  That's been going on for a while? 
[00:52:30]  I guess that first thing was marching teeth, but he took care of it.  And then last week, last Monday, he pulled this again.  And now they're saying that he's no longer a member of WWE's roster.  That's hard to believe.  All right, Kyle, thank you.  All right, bye.  Well, that's okay.  He can go to that other wrestling company.  I just spoke to the guy that hooks us up with people, and he said, yeah, it's confirmed that he's definitely not on their active roster.  And as of Saturday night, the door was closed to him returning.  Ah, that's what they said about Jerry the King Waller, too. 
[00:53:00]  Well, they say that about everybody, but some people, it does stick.  All right, Johnny, what's up?  Hey, Yopi.  What kind of fan are you?  You're open for four hours?  We were there in the 17th green from 7 in the morning through the rain to 8 o'clock at night.  I wanted to check out some of the main players because you camped out at the 17th, so you saw all the hacks go through.  Yeah, but we saw the hacks, and we sent our buddies out to the course.  They went out for two hours.  Half the guys are...  See the crowd.  Now, look, man, I watch a lot of golf. 
[00:53:30]  I really do.  It's just a great thing to do on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  You're mellow out, and you see if Tiger's going to win another one.  Man, it was like a rock concert.  It was like a rock concert in the stands.  I feel like...  He doesn't shut up.  It wasn't like a rock concert in the stands.  No, it wasn't.  It kind of was.  It wasn't.  All right.  Was Davis Love there?  Were they cheering for Davis Love?  All right.  On a rock show.  Hey, make the butt.  Johnny, what made it fun, though?  What golfing event do you have?  Johnny, what made it fun?  He doesn't want to talk.  The other stands. 
[00:54:00]  Johnny, what made it fun?  People were yelling in the stands, your side sucks.  Where do you hear that?  Where do you hear that in golf?  Whoa.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And that's what made it fun?  Just yelling at the other stands?  Pataki came in the stands.  It was raining.  Ah, it's great.  Just like a rock concert.  I was at OzFest, and there was Pataki.  We were yelling, you suck.  Ha, ha.  Good-naturedly laughing in polo shirts.  Pusa.  Two hours.  How many shots did you watch Tiger make?  I hate this guy, by the way. 
[00:54:30]  I watched him two, but I also followed the Norman group.  You know, you just don't sit at one place.  You follow a group.  You sit for a while.  You can't follow anyone, especially on a Sunday.  You go stand by a hole.  You watch a couple of groups go through.  Try to say something again.  I gave up on him a while ago.  I so want him to interrupt you again.  Just like a rock concert out there.  All right.  Rob, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Just got a little update on why Stone Cold left.  Yeah.  They wanted him to lose to Brock Lesnar last Monday to build up Brock for King of the 
[00:55:00]  Ring this week.  Huh?  Wrestling, yes, it is fixed, Norris.  All right, Rob.  So you think it's just a setup?  No, no, no.  It's definitely real.  He wasn't happy with the direction of his character.  He didn't feel as though he should have the job to Brock Lesnar.  Oh, so he didn't show up for it.  Right.  He just left.  All right.  All right.  Gary, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Yeah, Opie, I wanted to thank you for turning a hour-long railroad ride into two and a half  last night.  Thanks, douche.  What did you do? 
[00:55:30]  What did I do?  Opie.  Well, did you ride the railroad?  No.  Well, tons of you idiots did.  You idiots.  Golf people.  All you golf people running like madmen to catch the train.  Opie didn't ride the train, but tons of you idiots then.  The guy's making no sense.  Is everyone hung over today?  What are you talking about, Gary?  Why would a regular hour ride turn into two and a half hours?  I'm coming from out east.  Yeah.  And they stopped the train on the track to add more trains ahead of us. 
[00:56:00]  Hey, ass monkey.  Do you realize something else?  I drove back to Brooklyn from out on Long Island last night.  And it had nothing to do with golf.  It had to do with Father's Day, you tool.  Hey, what about the...  There was a lot of extra traffic.  What about the announcements on the train saying, because of the U.S. Open, we are stopping  the train here to load up golf folk.  Well, you know something?  I know the same thing happens on Mother's Day and Christmas.  It's just hell.  Whatever.  But, Gary, I mean, the U.S. Open, it's exciting for the whole area. 
[00:56:30]  You've got to admit.  That's true.  It was a good time.  I'm sorry, Opie.  All right.  What is wrong with everyone today?  I agree with that guy.  But what is wrong with everybody?  He's right.  We just went through, like, 20 minutes of phone calls, and they were all awful.  They were awful.  It's because of idiots like you that take the train.  Is everyone hung over because they were drinking all day at Fifth Page?  It was a rock show out there.  We even made the A-OK sign at the other guys. 
[00:57:00]  So it sounded like a rock show.  Yeah, Fleetwood Mac show.  How bad was that, that, you know, guys on the phone talking about how crazy the stands  were on the 17th hole, and we're going with it, hoping it's going to go somewhere.  And nothing.  Nothing.  Our side's better.  Our side's better.  Our side's better.  We did the our side's better than your side gag.  Did you hide their mascot, too?  They took their mascot goat up into the attic room.  If you're not flipping over cars and setting them on fire, I have no respect for your sports 
[00:57:30]  dedication.  Golf will get there.  Jason, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, check this out, man.  You guys, some of these guys sitting there complaining about Sergio and all this, about  his waggle and all that.  Well, my question is, who the hell's putting up these scores that they can contest how,  you know, he swings?  One, he's the only one of the few guys that's beat Tiger head to head.  And the other thing, all these guys that are sitting there saying, oh, golf like Norton.  What the hell's the matter with you, man?  When you're sitting here criticizing golf, don't you realize that that's the escape for 
[00:58:00]  most males that are married?  You get away from the wife.  You don't have to listen to her bitch and complain.  Exactly.  And you should just take the club and beat her with it.  Well, you know what?  Exactly.  That little CT's Moxley clunk.  After he spanked one out in the tree.  How do you fess to that one?  All right, Jason.  All right.  See you guys later.  That Skakel case is hysterical.  Classic.  Like, Kennedy cousin or whatever the hell he is. 
[00:58:30]  How does it get to the point where you have to admit that you climbed a tree, looked at  her through a window, and just jacked it?  Yeah, well, how does that ever come out?  Like, why does that have to come out?  If you know what's in your head, like, why do you then have to go, yeah, well then,  all right, I got to count for all the time that I was doing something after I talked to her.  All right, then I did climb the tree and I jacked it looking at her.  Wow.  Like, what are you going to, why does that have to be public knowledge?  Gotta respect that.  It's like he just walked around the block, you know, how many years ago? 
[00:59:00]  He's cranking it in a tree and then he caved her head in with a golf club.  Yeah, there's something really endearing about him, just the fact that he couldn't take it  anymore, she was too hot and her ass looked too good.  Yeah, that's what happened to him.  I can't look at this waddling down the block, I have to kill her.  I remember, you know, going to school and you'd see a girl that was just so goddamn hot  and you knew there was never a shot in hell of even talking to her.  He'd just look like, and some guys must just lose their money to go, I gotta cave her head  in with a golf club.  Little fat rich kid so used to getting what he wants. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  He can't have M.M.  Yeah, that little moxley ass.  Yeah.  All right, I'm going to make a rule, Anthony.  What's up?  It's obvious that we cannot discuss golf with our listeners.  Yeah, yeah, they don't appreciate the sport.  So golf discussions will now be banned from the Opie and Anthony show, unless they include  death.  Yes.  Like the stankle case.  We thought we would try a little highbrow, U.S. Open, right in our backyard, figured we 
[01:00:00]  could have a little discussion.  No, huh?  It stunk, and it's obvious we can't go highbrow.  They're not digging it?  With a golf discussion.  No, it was awful.  Oh, stop.  Oh, look at the instant feedback.  Were you looking at the instant feedback open?  No, I could just feel it.  I don't need to look at the instant feedback on this one.  Sometimes we wonder, how's it going?  But no, it sucked.  Guy calls up, says his area of the stands was better than that area.  Did you hear that one chant where they were yelling, I'm rubber, you're glue?  I know you are, but what am I?  Boy, golf gone bad. 
[01:00:30]  That should be a video.  Like the two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate chant?  Tiger, tiger, hooray.  If he can't do it, no one can.  And then they all mock the nervous tick and hug.  No more golf discussions on this show.  The current it boys of FM Talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony.  And the talk is racy and raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can.  Show your hairy pork chop.  My mother smokes crack rocks. 
[01:01:00]  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay you down and give you a little bukkake?  We laugh.  We're going to have a disgusting body.  Oh, it blow out.  Gay porn.  Hey, could you soap up your bad place?  The fluttier, the better.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.

You're the sorriest excuse of an owner I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:04:00]  Last Monday night on WWE Raw, Mr. McMahon showed up to put it all on the line.  I propose a match between Ric Flair and me, Vince McMahon.  This match will be for 100% ownership in world wrestling entertainment.  You got it!  With the company at stake, the match was a bloody and brutal battle from the stomach.  McMahon now has busted open Ric Flair.  But when the tide turned and the Nature Boy gained control, McMahon had the next big thing up his sleeve. 
[01:04:30]  Laser assaulting Ric Flair!  The hook of the leg!  And it's over!  Now that McMahon has 100% control of world wrestling entertainment, what will be first on the boss's agenda?

[01:10:00]  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, guys.  You missed out the most important golf story today.  All right.  None of this is U.S. Open crowd.  It's California golf course.  It's being fined or whatever because they had hookers on the golf course.  This is in between holes.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I want to help you out here.  This was the best story of the weekend.  And yes, you're right.  We forgot all about it.  Golf related.  It was a golf course outside of L.A., right, sir? 
[01:10:30]  Riverhead.  Riverside County.  Were they having a private function?  Well, like in between shots or whatever.  He's not answering the question.  What?  Was it a private function?  He has no idea.  Hold on, Joe.  Yeah, I think they were having like one of those private outings.  A little private tournament was going on.  Riverside County.  Like a company takes over the whole golf course for like 12 hours.  I used to have to caddy these things.  They're a complete nightmare.  But the sheriff said that they had this course under surveillance for about three weeks. 
[01:11:00]  So they've been doing this for a while.  Yeah.  And basically they hired some kind of local escort service and they set up tents.  And the hookers were in the tents.  And in between holes, guys who felt like it would go into the tents and bang the broads.  Yeah.  New meaning to a hole-in-one, man.  Right.  But some of these guys just didn't even care and they didn't use the tents and they were  just having sex in the open while other golfers are playing.  Wrong hole.  And a lot of these guys, believe it or not, are getting really pissed off that, you know,  this guy is banging a hooker. 
[01:11:30]  You're just going to the...  In plain sight of everybody else.  Of course they were getting mad.  That's exactly my point with golfers.  Oh, don't do that.  Bunch of bores.  Some of them did do it, though.  They were in the woods, some of them.  You know how they go off into the woods?  Yeah.  And then you get some dumb guy maybe hooked his ball into there and he's looking for  his ball.  And, well, insert your own joke there.  He sees a couple hanging in their own pouch, you know, banging on some hooker's ass. 
[01:12:00]  They weren't taking it out of the box.  Yeah.  I wouldn't care, but...  Yeah, here's the story.  Some people had a problem.  Golf tournament's suspected of offering prostitution.  Riverside County Sheriff's rated a golf tournament Friday where participants were allegedly offered  prostitutes.  They were having a private golf tournament.  Illegal acts of sex for money was offered during the tournament.  Numerous women could be seen detained on the grounds of Hidden Valley Golf Club and there  were small tents placed on several of the greens.  A TV station reported from its helicopters over the course. 
[01:12:30]  So they had helicopters tooling around.  They checked out all this.  About 50 men were detained also.  Phone calls to the Hidden Valley Golf Club were unanswered.  The 18-hole courses arrayed in a desert sitting about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.  Yeah, but I was reading another story where they were having sex right in the open for  everyone else to see.  Do you think any of the guys got stuck behind one guy who would hold his mule and then let  it go like a little waggle like Sergio?  Come on already.  Here's one of the golfers watching another golfer. 
[01:13:00]  Oh.  Get some action.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole!  Yeah.  Yes.  Very nice.  Joe.  Joe, you still there?  Yeah.  Thank you, Joe.  Joe, thank you.  Joe?  Oh, yeah.  No problem.  I'm sorry.  Are you a golfer, Joe?  Uh, no.  Not at all.  Should be.  Hey, thanks, Joe.  Yeah, I suck.  What?  He said he sucks.  Yeah, he said he sucks.  He doesn't suck, but he's honest.  Everyone's hungover today.  John, what's going on? 
[01:13:30]  Hello?  Yeah, John.  Yeah.  What's up, dude?  You know what?  Golf makes even hookers boring.  Stop talking about golf.  We thought the hooker angle was pretty good with the golf, though.  Yeah.  This calls for the old Billy Barule.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy.  This is a biggie.  Don't let me down, Billy.  $30,000, Billy. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What is going on today?  I've had it.  What is going on today?  No one even knows what just happened there, because we had to dump out.  I go to another phone call, and the guy's cursing, saying how he Fs hookers.  The guy's cursing.  I can barely talk.  He steps on my line.  But who was he talking to?  I don't know.  He was on hold, waiting to get on the show. 
[01:14:30]  Cluster F.  Was he talking to his friends?  Oh, man.  Ben's losing it.  It's hilarious.  All right.  Jim.  Yes?  Who the hell were you talking to?  I thought I was talking to the screener.  No, you were on hold, waiting to get on the show.  You were on hold.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  I thought I was still talking to him.  In my car phone, in the volume's way, I can't hear real well.  And had a great line.  You're cursing.  You were cursing, so we had to dump out of you and the line.  Oh, man.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to ruin the show. 
[01:15:00]  That's not what I'm all about.  This is the first time I've ever called, too, so maybe I'm just not into the whole rhythm.  All right.  What's up, Jim?  They've been having these go-go golf outings in New Jersey for a long time.  I can remember.  Where?  In the 80s.  This place in Boundbrook, Torpedoes, and Harrah's up in North Jersey used to throw these golf outings that they had up in,  I don't even remember the name of the golf course or the town it was in, but it was way up north.  And you basically went to the go-go bar in the morning about 7 o'clock, and you picked out your caddy. 
[01:15:30]  Uh-huh.  Right?  And they had, like, 40 girls dancing, and you had 100 golfers in there, and they're all broken up into foursomes.  And you take your caddy, you go on to the golf course, and by the second hole, the go-go dancer's naked.  And then all bets are off.  Anything goes in the middle of the golf course.  Now, the reason why they don't have them anymore is because they used to have the wimp old lady leagues and stuff like that playing at the same time.  So you'd have, like, a 70-year-old lady playing golf and looking across to the next team and seeing a naked woman spread eagle, you know, 
[01:16:00]  or hugging the back of somebody or just doing whatever on a golf course.  Now, were they having sex with these girls, or were they just, you know, doing the topless thing and stuff?  Well, it was kind of tough in the middle of the golf course, but there was a lot of woods,  and a lot of shenanigans were going on in the bathrooms after the tournaments were over, too.  Yeah, I think that was more like, you know, the beer girls were kind of like, you know, strippers from the... 
[01:16:30]  Similar thing, though.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Not a problem.  Are you guys the new sport guys?  Yeah.  That's what we're doing now.  Well, we're waiting.  Enough with the golf.  Enough.  Check it out.  We're dying over here.  Enough with the golf.  Hey, that's what everyone's saying.  Has anyone seen Monster's Ball yet?  Nice one.  Now, this I have not seen yet.  Get it tonight with hand cream. 
[01:17:00]  Let me tell you right now, as far as regular movies go, and I challenge people on this,  and I know what movie they're going to say that's better than this one,  this movie has the best sex scenes.  Out of what?  Any movie ever?  Normal movie.  Normal, but not porno.  Not porno.  You know, movies you could just see in a regular theater.  This could be the best sex scene I've ever seen.  Because my mother...  When Halle Berry gets it on with Billy Bob Thornton.  Yeah, my mother last night said she saw the movie, and I asked her, she goes, 
[01:17:30]  I don't know, I think Halle Berry just decided to start doing porno.  It was very close to porno, Anthony.  Really?  When she pretty much begged Billy Bob Thornton to just F her.  That was a big thing.  Looked over at Billy Bob Thornton and pretty much just ripped off her little top and said,  I need to be loved, or I need to be taken care of, or something.  Six minute scenes.  And then it was just scene after scene after scene after scene.  Well, what was that movie she did recently where she showed her boobs and it was like  the big deal?  Swordfish.  That was Swordfish, and they made this huge deal.  So she went from showing her boobs, which was like huge... 
[01:18:00]  I don't know which movie she filmed first, though, my friend.  ...to now just banging right on film, a year before they come out.  In this movie, you only caught a glimpse of one of her boobs, but it didn't matter.  I mean, it was just ridiculous, the sex scenes in this movie.  Yeah.  And then they have a hooker scene that was even hotter, where this hooker shows up at  the local motel, the guys pay her, or the son pays her.  She's kind of cute, even though she's got the... 
[01:18:30]  Gelatin boobs.  Yeah, you can tell that it's big boobs with the bag, the implants.  It folds on the side and stuff.  I hate those.  A blonde.  So she takes the money, puts it in her little purse or whatever, takes off her shirt, takes  off her pants, and just assumes the position on the dresser.  Puts her hands on the dresser and kind of bends forward, and the guy just does his thing  last, I don't know, 20, 30 seconds, and then she just puts her clothes on and leaves.  Quickie.  It was really hot as far as the quickie goes. 
[01:19:00]  Who plays the son in that one?  The dude that was in The Patriot and...  Legend.  And what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that knight movie.  Good movie.  What was it called?  Yeah, Knight's Tale.  Knight's Tale.  I gave Monster's Ball five and a half nuts on a scale.  Let me tell you something.  I don't even know what the movie was really about.  Don't matter.  And I was kind of getting bored with the whole damn thing, until the Halle Berry scene.  I don't need you to hold me.  It was... 
[01:19:30]  No, I need to be taken care of.  Oh, you're taken care of.  And Billy Bob Thornton got the job done.  She was quick to get out of that skirt.  Oh, man.  So...  Can you reset my computer, please?  Now your computer's broken?  You need to.  Yeah.  Hit the button.  Pain in my ass.  I would say this scene was even hotter than the one in the threesome there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  What movie?  With Nev and... 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Denise Richards.  Wild Things.  I would challenge anyone.  This scene might have been hotter than the scene from Wild Things.  That was pretty hot.  Denise Richards.  Very hot in that one.  Nev Campbell, huh?  Denise Richards when she's washing the car.  Very hot.  She's a girl that...  That could be the hottest scene in movie history.  She's a girl that can look unbelievably hot.  And then a picture taken at another angle.  Kind of a little funny looking. 
[01:20:30]  Kind of funny looking.  I was with the funny looking one.  Oh, so you were with the funny looking one?  Yeah.  Just kind of funny looking.  Hey, Paul, what's going on?  I just want to say, I watched Monsters Ball over the weekend, and I can't believe she won an Academy Award for that.  I could see her winning a porno Academy Award, but...  Yeah, her acting wasn't that great.  It wasn't that great.  And I mean, but the sex was unbelievable.  I sat...  My jaw was on the floor. 
[01:21:00]  I was drooling on myself.  What about the stripper that went to the motel there?  Yeah, pretty funny.  Assume the position.  Assume the position.  It was Billy Bob and his son in the movie, too.  Wasn't that something?  Yeah, well, the son banged her, but no, Billy Bob Thorne wasn't feeling it that night.  He was all depressed, so he got behind her, and then he was like, eh.  Did you bang the same person?  And then he's like, you can keep the money.  I don't care.  That was a strange movie, though, but...  Halle Berry, Bush?  Do we see Bush? 
[01:21:30]  No, no.  No?  That's what we're saying.  Not really, no.  Well, maybe that's with her line.  I mean, but that's about everything else that you see.  I mean, you just barely see that if there's any Bush, you can't make it out.  I would say because you couldn't see the Bush area and both boobs and stuff, it made it  even hotter, just how they were filming it with all the different angles and stuff.  They tease you, because the coffee table would block it, the way they were sitting around  the floor.  Oh, really?  Or then you're kind of peeking into the room through a doorway, but all you can see is 
[01:22:00]  kind of her, like, sweating.  Oh, that's kind of hot.  Doing, like, backwards cowgirl type thing.  Oh, you get a little peek here, a little peek there.  What was that movie?  Now, I know another hot scene that I remember we had talked about this one, too.  I cannot remember the name of the movie.  I think it was, yeah, that's hot.  I think it was, like, one of those, one of the Tilly girls there.  Oh, Bound? 
[01:22:30]  Rick's talking about that.  Gina Gershon.  There's some amazing lesbian sex scenes in Bound.  That was hot.  No, there's another one.  I'm not sure if that's the same movie.  Listen, where the guy is with one of the girls.  And another guy comes in and ties the guy up.  That was it.  Was that it?  And he's banging the guy's chick in the bathroom.  No, I know the movie.  And the guy's tied up, and he can just look in.  Oh, yeah, but he dies in the elevator.  Was that Madsen?  Was that Michael Madsen?  Yeah, Michael Madsen.  And then he walks in and goes, were you looking at us? 
[01:23:00]  That was a really hot scene.  I forgot about that one.  He's devastated, and she's laughing and going, ah, ah.  She's just totally getting into it.  Well, it was the nerdy husband.  Right, right, right.  And it was, ah, ah, man.  It was Kim Basinger was in there, right?  Was it?  And Mike, I think it was Michael Madsen was the guy.  It was Michael Madsen.  And Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid?  Shut up, Jim.  We're into a good discussion here.  Alec Baldwin was in there?  No.  Oh, my thing. 
[01:23:30]  My thing.  Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger.  No.  I think you're telling you guys.  No, help me out.  Someone will get it.  I'll get it.  That was a really, really hot scene.  The guy was a veterinarian or something?  Well, like the guy kidnaps, what's her name?  Right.  Yeah.  With the husband.  With the husband.  And then they kind of fall in love, and then they tie up the guy in the bathroom, and the  doors open a little bit, and she is just having a good effing time.  The getaway? 
[01:24:00]  It might be the getaway.  Yeah, it was.  I think Alec Baldwin.  Dominic, thank you.  I think it was the getaway, Anthony.  Look that up.  I forgot about it.  That scene could have been even hotter than the one from Monster's Ball.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Guy on girl sex scenes are never as hot to me in regular films, because you can't see  anything.  Lesbians are always much hotter in rated R films, because you can see a little bit more.  Unless you're laying next to Voss.  That scene was so hot, because, I mean, the guy was so helpless, and his chick that he  really, really loved was just getting railed right in front of him, and there was nothing 
[01:24:30]  he could do.  It was a sick, sick scene.  Yeah, that ain't even coming up.  Huh?  The getaway?  Yeah, a lot of people saying the getaway.  Yeah, but it ain't even coming up.  Now, someone on the instant feedback, because we're slammed here, was Kim Basinger and Alec  Baldwin in that movie?  I don't think they were.  They were bank.  The getaway was about them being bank robbers.  Yeah.  The bound wasn't.  I don't think Alec Baldwin was in that with bound.  We're not talking about bound anymore, dude.  I mean, what the hell are we talking about? 
[01:25:00]  No, the getaway.  The getaway.  I'm almost positive.  I would bet money that.  I would bet money those two were in that movie.  I don't remember Alec Baldwin in it.  Hmm.  Hmm.  You can't get it in.  Maybe he was.  Wait.  I can't find it.  Bastards.  All right.  Let's go to the phone.  Scott, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  What's up?  Great show as always.  That was the best scene ever.  What?  Monsters Ball?  Oh, dude.  I think Wild Things is second best.  I think.  Oh, so you think it beat out Wild Things, huh? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  That most definitely.  All right.  Most definitely.  Thank you, Scott.  Is Norton there?  Yes, I am.  Sort of.  Sort of.  Norton, I got you tickets for September 7th, man.  Can't wait.  Can't wait to go to Westbury.  Thank you, buddy.  No problem.  Have fun.  Later, guys.  Tickets went on sale for that already?  Yeah, they went on sale Friday.  They're on sale now at Ticketmaster.  Of course, I don't have the number because that would be helpful.  All right.  Joey, what's up?  Joey.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  What's up, Joey?  That was Jennifer Tilly, Alec Baldwin, and King Basinger in that movie. 
[01:26:00]  It was, right?  It definitely was.  We got away.  I kind of remember the movie wasn't that great, but like I said, that scene was unbelievable, man.  Oh, Jennifer Tilly.  I called her Meg Tilly.  What a dope.  Yeah, Jennifer Tilly.  Jennifer Tilly is about her sister or something.  All right, Joey, thank you.  Pretty good.  Yeah.  As far as the sex scene in the movie, that's right up there, but the rest of the movie, eh.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  It definitely was The Getaway.  It was a remake of a Steve McQueen, Ally McGraw movie back in the 60s, and in the original, 
[01:26:30]  Sally Struthers was the wife getting railed in the room.  Yeah.  I didn't let that.  Sally Struthers.  They were eating chicken parts and throw it in his face while he was tied up.  Hey, little girl, keep it down in there, hi.  Hey, teach your mother how to brag me like that, nah.  Hey, guys, now.  Sean, thanks for setting up Norris for us today.  Sorry about that.  One other thing.  There was a movie in the early 90s called The Lover, with the rumor and all this gossip  that this underage actress was getting nailed in the movie. 
[01:27:00]  That's why the scenes were so realistic.  I think I saw The Lover.  It was pretty odd.  Some Chinese guy was nailing some 15-year-old girl.  I think I saw that movie.  The movie blew, but I remember the sex scenes in that were pretty good, too.  There was nothing else blew, too, yeah.  Right on.  Yeah.  You guys saw it.  Way to take the sex out of that hot scene, hearing that Sally Struthers did it originally.  Sally Struthers in the original, huh?  Yeah.  Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Michael Madsen, James Woods was in that, too.  That's right. 
[01:27:30]  I guess.  And, yeah, the guy, who was the guy, though, that was tied up and had a watch?  No one really famous.  It wasn't?  I don't remember seeing him in any other movies, really.  I'm sure someone like Big Kevin would give you his whole resume, but I don't remember.  Oh, is that when they tied the guy up and put a ball in his mouth in the bathroom?  No, they just tied him up and made him watch.  And they sing, singing in the rain and kick him in the stomach and slap his face.  Well, Jennifer Tilly was the worst, too, because she's like, oh, you naughty boy, you're watching us.  She was into it. 
[01:28:00]  She was such a scumbag to this guy.  And I don't think the guy did anything really that bad.  No.  He deserved what she put him through, man.  She's sexy.  And Michael Madsen's just pounding her.  You just hear, like, chung, chung, chung, chung.  She's getting pounded.  She's moaning, and he's watching through the door.  This guy watched the movie last night.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right.  Listen, I just, I can't believe you're talking about this.  I just watched the unrated version of The Getaway last night. 
[01:28:30]  They have an unrated version?  Yes, an unrated version.  And Kim Basinger-Busch.  You want to talk about a hot scene, rent the unrated movie.  Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger going at it, and you see every part of Kim Basinger that you ever want to see.  Did they go out and, was it in a hotel room that they were?  Yes.  I think they see the unedited version.  That's a lot bloodier, too, in a gunfight scene.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  Well, Joe, the movie wasn't that great, though, right?  The movie sucked.  The movie sucked.  The original was better, but it's the same Kim Basinger. 
[01:29:00]  I mean, and also, the carpet doesn't match the curtains, just to let you know.  Right on.  Well, thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Of course not.  I think we knew from that other movie there that, oh, my God, I can't think of movies today.  The movie there, Kim Basinger.  The movie there.  You know what I think?  With the food and stuff.  Oh, nine and a half weeks.  Nine and a half weeks.  Good for you.  John, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Great show.  I'm going to bring it down to reality.  I was at the golf corner, man.  I was at Thursday and Saturday.  All right. 
[01:29:30]  Come on.  I got some death and comedy in this one.  Well, hurry up.  There's a guy in the 15th tunnel, and they're putting.  The guy's going, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, I had to hear this guy screaming after every single putt.  Then I heard DJ Singh attack Rich Voss and killed him with his golf club.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Wouldn't that have been great?  There were a bunch of a-holes.  And Noonan, though.  Yelling Noonan.  They were yelling a lot of crazy things.  It was pretty funny.  Voss even bought.  I saw Voss last week.  We went out to eat, and he showed me his golf seat that he bought. 
[01:30:00]  I wanted to bludgeon him with it.  It's one of those little things you put, and you open it.  It's a portable seat.  No, he didn't.  Oh, yes, he did.  Oh, yeah.  Voss is into his golf.  I know he is, but he bought a seat.  Oh, and you can open it up anywhere and carry it with you.  Yeah, it's got a little stick, and you open it like a little bicycle seat.  A little stick with a seat on it.  I should relax while you're watching him play some golf.  I've seen those things.  Yeah, bring his mitts.  That is big-time loser.  Yeah, you should.  A little midget kickstand, huh?  Yeah.  What's up, Joe?  A stool and a rope.  Back to the getaway for a second.  I guess it's unanimous.  I can't even speak.  We're all getting off on doing another guy's wife. 
[01:30:30]  That's pretty much what that scene is.  We were all enjoying that.  Well, there was something erotic about it.  That ain't true.  That's exactly what's going on.  You're doing another guy's wife.  Yeah, but the lady dies married.  It was wrong.  All right, go ahead, Joe.  Anyway, you can't contend with Basic Instinct, the director's cut, with him and the doctor,  him and the psychiatrist.  I heard the director's cut of that movie was great, but I've never seen it.  That's only an extra minute or two.  But even though Basic Instinct still holds up, it's one of the pretty much the nastiest films  out there that you pretty much enjoy. 
[01:31:00]  Right on.  All right.  All right, golf sucks.  With the gas shot.  I thought Rodney and Juliette Lewis was pretty sexy in Natural Born Killers.  That I liked.  That was a pretty good scene, actually.  Go up and take a bath for Daddy.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that great?  That was a pretty sexy thing.  Take a bath for Daddy.  All right.  Hey, little girl.  Oh, he's just shondling up.  He was great in that movie.  So bad.  He was great in that movie.  Bob, what's up?  You know, you don't have to sit through all that crap plot and stuff on Monsters Ball. 
[01:31:30]  You can download just a six-minute sex scene on Morpheus and Kazan and all that.  They've got all the good sex scenes for all of them.  Byrne goes to jail.  All those good sex scenes are all on Kazan and Morpheus.  So all you have to do is you can just download the sex scenes and screw the rest of the movie?  Who needs that?  Right.  Yeah, I would love.  You know what?  Someone should do this, Anthony.  And there's a company out there.  They advertise on this show.  Remember they did all the scariest scenes from movies?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What was it called? 
[01:32:00]  And the best fights.  The Boogeyman DVD?  The Boogeyman DVD is where they just have the scary scenes from all these different movies.  So it's like a montage.  And then the latest one that came out was all the great fights.  The fight scenes.  If they want to sell something, they should get all the hottest sex scenes from a lot of these movies.  Put it on one DVD.  It would sell like crazy.  Rated X, though.  Huh?  It would have to be like rated X.  No, not really.  Because these are all in regular movies.  Movies you see in the theater.  Tear in the aisles. 
[01:32:30]  Tear in the aisles.  Jesus.  I thought I won a game.  Norris, you've got to relax.  I know.  I'm a little excited.  You don't have to comment about everything we're saying.  You're funny.  Just pick your spot and go with it.  Just relax.  I just want to fit in.  Lisa Bonet, Mickey Rourke, Angel Heart.  Yeah, I saw that movie, too.  Know why?  Because no one cares.  But if you have a witty little thing, because we said that, then jump in.  You're driving Rick nuts.  One of those wrong sex scenes was traffic. 
[01:33:00]  That was just wrong.  No, you know what?  Yes.  No, I thought that was a really, really hot scene, too.  Yeah, but because it was so wrong.  It was disturbing, actually.  The father walks in.  The black crack dealer is pounding.  No, you know what?  We were called out on that.  I don't think the father ever...  He didn't.  He never saw this.  No, he saw his daughter getting raped.  Her in bed.  That is a really high shock.  And there was an older white guy.  When Michael Douglas walked in, there was an older white guy there.  And he goes, I never touched her, man.  And he left.  Yeah, right.  The black guy banging her.  But he knew what was going on.  Right.  But he didn't actually see it.  I thought that scene was beyond hot. 
[01:33:30]  Ugh.  Beyond hot.  I mean, granted, the guy was well built, but that was just gross.  She's just getting slammed by the crack dealer guy.  She has a vacant look on her face.  Yeah.  Well, she wanted the, you know, the candy.  She had to do some little special to get the candy.  I'm not saying the guy was wrong.  Huh?  I'd say it was disturbing.  It was another hot scene.  There was something titillating about it, but it's just so wrong.  Well, that's what makes it kind of hot.  Her helplessness made it hot.  Every guy wants to have a really beautiful woman that helpless and willing to do anything 
[01:34:00]  for something we have.  The bathtub scene in The Shining.  Ooh.  There's a hot one.  That actually started hot, because, I mean, Shelley Duvall was so awful, and then he  has this nine compared to her, and then she...  Did you see her hedges, though, in her black?  I like...  I like...  What do you mean?  Oh, the...  Yeah.  I don't mind that.  It was the late 70s.  What did they know?  That Kay Parker from Tabool look.  It's like...  I like a little bush.  It's nice.  You like a little bulk there?  Yeah.  And then she steps towards him.  That's pretty hot.  They cube that out on TV, and it just pisses me off. 
[01:34:30]  Of course.  Yeah.  Hold on.  There's one more scene from Getaway I forgot all about.  Go ahead, Matt.  Don't say...  Hey, guys.  Don't...  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm going to help you out so you can be on the radio today.  Don't say the P word for...  You know what, okay?  Okay.  Use another word, and it should go through.  Watch him do it.  Guy gets done banging the guy's...  The vet's wife.  Yeah.  He walks into the bathroom to relieve himself.  Guy's hanging from the ceiling, just kind of pushes him gently out of the way so he  used the bathroom. 
[01:35:00]  He's like a carolized.  Yeah, a guy killed himself.  I forgot about that part.  Yeah, it was pretty sick.  Cool.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Howard Sprague.  What?  Jason, what's up?  Yeah, in the original Getaway, man, the most of them that had to watch Sally Struthers  get F was Howard Sprague from the Andy Griffith show.  From the old Andy Griffith show? 
[01:35:30]  Really?  It was great, man.  He's the ultimate awkward freak.  Who was the guy banging her?  McQueen?  Ah, it was some, like, big Mexican-looking guy that just sat around drinking and was fat  and hairy.  Hey, Jason, was the original as hot?  Ah, you know, she looked pretty good back in those days.  It was pretty erotic.  It must have been...  Just have to look at her now, though.  If you remember, she didn't...  It once was.  Yeah, there were times, you know, she didn't look that bad.  Right.  Yeah, she was hot.  She was all bubbly and giddy and laughing.  That movie came out in 72. 
[01:36:00]  72, so she looked pretty good.  Yeah, it was pretty hot.  Sam Peckinpah did that one.  Nice.  All right.  Walter Hill.  Allie McGraw was one of the girls in there?  Yep.  Yeah, she was smoking.  Sally Struthers.  There she is.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Let's go to Ryan.  And goddamn Slim Pickens.  One of the best actors ever.  Hey, what happened to our Slim Pickens audio clips?  We used to have hundreds of those.  Ryan, what's going on? 
[01:36:30]  Jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots.  Yes.  What's up, Ryan?  Yo, original sex scene from Poison Ivy, Tom Skerritt, and Drew Barrymore.  Yeah, that's out there.  We talked about that one.  That's got to be top five.  Easily.  Yo, I'll be.  Sarah Gilbert comes in and sees her father, Tom Skerritt, and he's doing...  What's her face here there?  Help me.  Help me.  Drew Barrymore.  She's got a leg up on the piano bench.  And he's just giving her the slow, long stroke. 
[01:37:00]  California long stroke.  That's a good one.  That is really good.  What about Showgirls?  That movie was so awful, I could care less.  Yeah.  That was just the worst.  But, you know, it's kind of cool to see.  Now, Anthony, someone is asking you about Mulholland Drive.  I did not see that movie.  There's a good sex scene in there?  Yeah.  You could stay up until it happens.  Crap movie.  Yeah, there's a pretty good dyke scene in there.  Nice big canned lesbo and some smaller broad just licking her. 
[01:37:30]  Good job.  Good job.  Good job.  But the movie stunk.  All right.  Tracy Morgan should be here in a few minutes, Anthony.  Yeah.  Also, we got Call Lady Di.  We got the guy that invented the black man game.  And we could, I think we might be able to have fun with this.  Some band wants us to play their latest song. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And they sent pictures of one of the guy's girlfriends.  Yes.  She looks like Alicia Silverstone.  Let me see those pictures.  This girl is beyond hot, and I guess the band is willing to have this guy's girlfriend  come in and do just about anything to get the song on the radio.  Check out these pictures.  There's pictures of her pretty much naked.  She is solid.  Well, she's got lingerie on and stuff and all these seductive poses.  That's why you're in a band.  It's for girls like that. 
[01:38:30]  Rick, where's the note that came along?  Oh, he went to the bathroom.  Yeah.  She's all right, this one.  Yeah.  She's beautiful.  Doesn't she look a lot like Alicia Silverstone when Alicia Silverstone was hot?  Yeah.  John Young from Clueless.  Yeah, definitely.  Rick's running down to get the note real fast, but basically...  That's the good girl picture.  She will come in and do whatever so the band can get some airplay.  How about that?  So we want to call this guy and see what this is all about. 
[01:39:00]  If it's really someone's girlfriend, how serious they are.  Or if it's like a Steve-O's girlfriend type girlfriend.  Right.  Nah, she looks pretty innocent and, I don't know, almost like she was forced to do this  because they really want the exposure.  Which would be the hottest thing ever.  Yeah.  Nothing sexier than when the pants are coming off little teardrops like in Ghost.  All right, here it is, Anthony.  Dear ONA Show, here's a sample of our music as well as pictures of my girlfriend.  We want to come on your show. 
[01:39:30]  If you listen to our song, you will see that the songs are good.  My girlfriend will do whatever it takes to get us played on your show.  This could be fun.  Thanks, guys.  Huge fans.  A band called Knuckle Sandwich.  Dude, if you're going to try to make it in the music business, you've got to get a better name.  Yeah?  The Knuckle Sandwich?  Knuckle Sandwich.  You like Knuckle Sandwiches?  I don't care what they're called.  His girlfriend's hot.  It doesn't matter to me what the name of the band is.  What type of music is it?  I don't know.  Well, we can't play it because that'll tip our hand.  Yeah, that'll wreck the whole bit. 
[01:40:00]  Let me look at the album cover.  See, doesn't the K and S from the Knuckle Sandwich?  See, they got K Knuckle S Sandwich.  Yeah, but they got the same font as Kiss.  The K and the S is...  Good thing they weren't called Silly Sandwich the way that S is shaped.  Jews screaming all over the place.  Be careful, Knuckle Sandwich.  Gene Simmons is going to sue you.  He probably would.  He probably would.  The font is too close to the Kiss logo.  It really looks like Kiss.  And then, let me see that a minute because up top also, Knuckle Sandwich, their logo looks 
[01:40:30]  like Krispy Kreme Donuts logo.  Yeah, it does.  Like they've just completely ripped off logos.  Maybe that's why they do it.  Maybe.  If that's why, then that's very clever.  Well, we'll find out about it when we call these guys.  When?  Let's call the radio tees, dude.  We say up next and then hopefully they stay through the commercials and we get a little  more TSL when the ratings come in.  A little TSL, they call it in the biz.  What's that?  I'm just going to drop dead here for a minute. 
[01:41:00]  It's called time spent listening.  You want your listeners to listen longer.  Linger longer, eh?  That's the whole goal of a radio show.  What a doodle.  All right.  Whatever.  If you don't want to stick around as we talk to this guy, then screw you.  Hey, they're going to miss it.  They're lost.  They're going to miss some incredible radio.  Yeah.  Then go screw.  You got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh! 
[01:41:30]  Bulls, you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  We're coming.  Jackass.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Extreme.  Extreme.

Aye, she left him wide open and he's in a rough spot.  He'll not be happy with that.  Well, how does he now get himself out of danger and back in serious contention? 
[01:50:30]  As you can see on his face, he's desperately trying to decide on the best approach.  He's consulting with his partner, Ferry Johnson, on this one.

[01:54:30]  Oh, wait.  I needed you.  I needed you so much.  All right.  Enough of that, man.  There's a scene from Monsters Ball.  Wow.  And finally checked it out.  What do you think?  It's right up there, right?  That is something.  It is. 
[01:55:00]  Jesus Christ.  That is something.  I love it.  Billy Bob's Horton just banging away at her forever.  All right.  Let's go back to the phones and talk to Jeff.  What's up, Jeff?  Yo, what's going on?  I grew up with these guys.  The only time I see them now is like at funerals and weddings.  And we used to hook up.  I used to hang out with them, guys.  We'd hook up with girls.  Yeah.  And every girl that had fun with the band, Norton's going to love this, they got an animal name. 
[01:55:30]  Like one chick, she was real tall, she was adorable.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  He's talking about the band Knuckle Sandwich.  Oh, he was?  Yeah, just before.  Because I had no clue what he was talking about.  Just before break, Knuckle Sandwich is a local band, I believe, from the Jersey area, Anthony,  and they want to try to get some attention through our radio show.  Right.  So the band, they sent in one of their songs that they would like us to play on the radio  for 25 Cities, Anthony.  Yes.  And to entice us a little bit, one of the guys had his girlfriend pose for you and I. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  And she's in one, two, three or four different pieces of lingerie.  She looks like Alicia Silverstone when Alicia Silverstone was really hot.  Was young and stuff.  Wow.  And I guess this girl will come in and do pretty much anything if we play the band's  song on the radio.  Is that where we're at with this, right?  What a jumper.  Well, we got Richie from Knuckle Sandwich on the line here.  Let's talk to Richie.  Richie, what's up? 
[01:56:30]  How you doing?  Well, we got your package, bro.  Yeah.  Did you listen to it?  Not yet.  No, we haven't even listened yet.  You will like it.  We want to listen to it live on the radio after this.  Whose girlfriend is this?  This is mine.  All right, Richie, how old are you?  I am 24.  And how old's your girlfriend?  She's 21.  This girl's 21?  Yeah.  And how long have you been with her?  Not that long.  Is she a big fan of the band or a big fan of you?  That's exactly what happened, you know? 
[01:57:00]  She's a big fan of the band.  She comes to all the shows.  And, you know, I just pick out, you know, would you blame me?  No, she's really hot.  Oh, my God.  So you want us to play your song on the radio, right?  Absolutely.  And this girl will do anything?  Well, she is, as well as the rest of the band, are huge Opie and Anthony fans.  And when she heard that, you know, I had this idea, she was like, I would just love to meet them.  And I said, well, you know, do you think if I could send some pictures in and they said, could we come in the studio, would you want to go in? 
[01:57:30]  And she said, oh, my God, yeah, I'll do anything.  So I guess we've got to get your girlfriend to do something.  And if she does that, then we'll play the song for 25 cities, man.  I absolutely, that's wonderful.  I'm hoping that you would listen to it just on our musical merit alone.  But if this is what it takes, we can get it off.  Well, this is what it takes.  Yeah, this is definitely what it takes.  All right.  All right.  A couple things, dude.  The KS, your logo.  Yes.  It looks a lot like the KISS logo. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Well, I consider myself a marketing genius.  And I come up with these little things.  Like, if you notice the other Krispy Kreme logo, too.  Yes, I noticed that.  Okay, we did notice that.  Okay.  We weren't sure if you were going with that motif.  Yeah, I go with little things to get people's attention.  You know, they look at it and they go, oh, that's KISS.  And then second glance.  No, that's not.  That's KS.  What is KS?  All right.  And we go from there.  All right, it's smart.  I thought you guys just weren't that creative.  No.  But you were going for that.  So now, all right, I have a little respect for you.  I am ultra-creative, as you will find when you get to meet me face-to-face. 
[01:58:30]  Mampu-i-mano.  Now, what kind of music are you guys are doing?  Well, we're doing all our own music.  I guess you would consider us in the same genre as similar to the offspring, I guess you would say.  Maybe a little more rock.  A little more straight-up rock.  A little more straight-up rock.  Are you kind of like Nickelback?  Well, I can't say we're kind of like anything.  We're trying to do our own sound.  Oh, that's always good.  That's very good.  Good, good, good, good.  Yes, if you play the song Show Me the Rock, of course you would do it off the air, 
[01:59:00]  because I understand the stipulation we have going on here.  But if you listen to it, I guarantee you will say these guys are friggin' awesome.  I could say friggin' on the air, correct?  Yeah.  Well, what you've got to do, Richie, this is what we're going to do for you, okay?  You get together with your band, and you get together with your hot piece of ass girlfriend.  By the way, I noticed that she's got a wood floor.  Let's just put it that way.  She's posing next to a wood floor, and she has a wood floor.  Yes.  You can see the little camel toe right there.  Kind of through the, no nude shots.  You guys didn't notice? 
[01:59:30]  She didn't give us any nude shots.  Oh, look closer.  Come on.  Let's be tasteful now.  I love camel toe.  Oh, look at the white outfit a little closer.  There's nothing sexier than camel toe.  There you go.  So, Richie, you guys get together with the band and your hot girlfriend, you guys decide  what you want to do, and if we could agree on something, we'll have you come down and  we'll do the whole damn thing.  Yeah.  We will definitely come to something.  All right.  Don't you worry about it.  All right.  And look, look.  Yes, sir.  And we try to teach everyone this last week.  Don't come back to us and say, well, what do you want us to do? 
[02:00:00]  Right.  You got it.  I understand.  I can be creative.  You say you're creative and all that.  You come up with something, and if we like what you came up with, we'll have you come down  here, okay?  That sounds great.  Are we on the radio right now?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I didn't know that.  Can I plug the website at least?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I love you.  I love you.  www.knucklesandwich.com.  www.  www.  www.  www.  www.  Yeah.  You clicked him too late. 
[02:00:30]  No.  If all that was left with .com, I thought I'd look like a tough guy, but he got the whole  thing out except .com.  That's what I'm saying.  You clicked him too late.  www.  www.  www.  So, does anyone even say www anymore?  You forgot to put, you forgot to say on.  H-T-T-P slash slash colon.  There's no reason to say www anymore.  You know who did that the other day was Tim Savian, the program director of the Chicago  station and the Philly station. 
[02:01:00]  You know what it says?  He goes, okay, I want you to check out a website.  Go to H-T-T-P.  Are you sure that isn't H-T-T-P-S?  It isn't a secure site that I have.  There's no reason.  Anyone that says H-T-T-P, first of all, should just be shot.  But you don't even realize how uninformed you sound.  You know why he said that?  Because it's Hey Tim, tight pants.  Yes, type in Hey Tim, tight pants. 
[02:01:30]  All right, let's go.  Holin slash slash.  Let's go to Melissa Anthony.  She's one of the contestants in the WOW contest.  Melissa.  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  She's representing Philly.  Okay.  Let me look.  I got the picture up.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  My computer blows ass after that.  What's going on, Melissa?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Contestant number A, right?  That is correct.  Let me look.  Let me look.  I'm not there yet.  You got some biggums.  Got some biggums, and they're all real.  How big?  Well, I'll tell you how big that is.  Well, I'm not that good when it comes to pictures. 
[02:02:00]  I will go with a 38.  Close so far?  You're good.  Okay.  Okay, well, probably, yeah, I was going to go double D, but I'm going to go D, 38 D.  We're a double D.  Damn it, Jim.  We're a double D.  Very nice.  And if you want to get technical, they're actually, like, if you go to, like, the places  to get them fitted, they're a 36 HHI if you want to get technical.  Okay.  HIV?  No.  Oh.  All right.  You got a nice set there.  Thank you.  How are we? 
[02:02:30]  I'm trying to impress Norton.  That's all I want to do.  Oh, Rick has a question for you.  Sure.  Rick, what?  Mr. I'm brave when the mic's not on.  Yes, Rick?  What would you like to say to Melissa?  Melissa, Rick has something for you.  Oh, now you want to see the picture.  Go ahead, Rick.  You're looking at the wrong picture, Rick.  Go ahead, Rick.  No, I'm looking at the right picture.  Go ahead.  I just wanted to know what happened to the rest of her.  The rest of what?  What?  The rest of what, Rick?  Yeah.  The rest of you.  The rest of me?  What's wrong with Melissa?  Melissa, what are you saying?  What is wrong with you, Rick? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Well, my one pose didn't get on there that you guys would have loved, but it was too obscene.  Well, did you send that to tinkledrinker at AOL.com?  If you want me to, I will.  You bet I do.  Rick, what is wrong with Melissa?  I'm just saying.  What happened to the rest of you?  What's wrong with me?  I don't see anything that's wrong with this girl.  I don't know what you say.  I see one shot.  Melissa, Anthony and I think you're beautiful, and Rick is trying to make something.  Yeah.  He's trying to be shocking.  Well, do they send the other pictures to you guys?  Like, they took five, and one didn't make it.  We only have one picture of you so far. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  But I don't know if I can even say on air what I was doing.  Oh, you can say anything you want on the air.  Okay.  Well, on air, for you guys, I went and put it up there, so I was a little disappointed.  Well, that's very nice of you.  Yeah, just for you guys.  You're a good egg.  Thank you.  All right, so what do you want to know today, Melissa?  We want to know when we get to start to vote.  I have a lot of people.  I mean, I have, like, people from all the way down in Florida who are interested in voting.  I met the kid at the bar.  We took him out to the bar, showed him a good time, and he can't wait to get back down to Florida and tell all his friends. 
[02:04:00]  To be honest, until we get some quality in this contest, the voting's not going to begin for a while.  So are you saying I'm not quality?  No, you're probably the only girl up there with quality.  There we go.  No, there's more.  No, there's a few more.  They know who they are.  There's a few.  There is a few more.  I even like that trend.  I like Melissa.  I like her, her, and her.  Look at the one that looks like, would you F me?  I would F me. 
[02:04:30]  Would you F me?  Ah.  No, Melissa.  Ah.  Wait a minute.  Was she a great big fat person?  Ah.  We got to give, uh, hey, we're talking to Frederica Bimmel.  We got to give the girls more time to qualify there, Melissa.  All right.  Will you guys announce it on air when you can start voting?  Of course.  If you're a fan of the show, you'll know.  But we need a few more weeks, I'm thinking.  We're definitely a big fan.  We want to take a trip up to New York and just meet you guys in person one of these days.  You keep talking we.  Who's we?  Well, I have, like, friends at work who, like, I'm at work right now. 
[02:05:00]  I've got the card here somewhere.  And they're letting me do this for you guys right now.  And we just want to take a big trip up and just come up and see you guys.  All right, Melissa.  All right.  Good luck to you in the contest.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Okay.  Think through the hips, roomie.  You're a great big fat person.  She was a large girl.  Anthony, wow contest.

[02:05:30]  show broadcast from.  And let them snap a picture or two of you giving your best wow.  Your best whipping them out.  And they'll put them up on the website.

And the contestants are up on OpieandAnthony.com.  The rules are up on OpieandAnthony.com. 
[02:06:00]  I would F me.  Cleveland's still trying to figure out where they're going to take pictures of the girls.  They have a bunch of girls that want in on the contest.  But the building they broadcast from, they're having a little problem with the nudity thing.  So hopefully Cleveland will be representing soon when they figure it all out.  Can that stupid building just mind their business?  I know.  The landlord or the owner or somebody has a real problem.  Of course they do.  Now, I hope contestant number nine, Gemini, Gemini, Gemini, Gemini, I hope she's not listening 
[02:06:30]  right now.  But it has to be said, a lot of email coming in.  A lot of people are convinced that Gemini is a guy or was a guy.  It's not coming from me.  No.  It's coming from a lot of the listeners that have checked out the photos so far.  That's what people are saying, based not only, not on anything, it's like her hands.  The hands are really big and the legs, people are just saying, wait, that has to have been  a man.  Wow.  So we got Matt from WYSP in Philly.  And Matt took the pictures of Gemini, right, Matt? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, what's up, guys?  All right, what can you tell us about Gemini?  All right, sure.  Well, for the first couple of days, we weren't getting anybody coming down.  So Cousin Ed called up one of his buddies, the cheerleaders here in Philly.  Actually, he was the one in Jersey.  And three girls came down, and Gemini was one of them.  Yeah.  And, well, she's definitely a woman.  Oh?  I don't know if you guys saw some of the other pictures.  Of her?  Yeah.  No, thank God you only sent one. 
[02:07:30]  She places the lotion in the basket.  She places the lotion.  Yeah, that's good.  Ah, ah, ah.  Before it gets the hose again.  All right.  So you're saying Gemini is definitely a lady.  Yeah.  The gods are a bastard.  She was doing, like, handstands in the studio, and the girls were like, there was three girls.  She was doing handstands, and the other two girls were, like, touching her and putting  her tongue in certain places.  Yeah.  I don't think those pictures can go up on the website. 
[02:08:00]  Did she hurt herself moving a couch?  Yeah.  Wait, what size are you?  Fourteen?  Perfect.  All right, Matt.  So, yeah.  All the girls in Philly, come on down.  Okay.  I'm here waiting.  I want to be busy.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Later.  It's easy.  We need more girls to show up at the radio stations.  What girl does it want to try for five grand?  Well, you know what?  We've only had officially one local girl come to New York.  Yeah.  The other girls just happen to be porn stars, and you know what? 
[02:08:30]  I think they were from D.C., but they're listed on opianthony.com as being from New  York, representing New York.  They should not be listed as New York.  They were in New York for the day, but those were the girls we met when we were broadcasting  live from JFK and D.C.  So, so far, we've had one girl in New York come by for the WOW Contest.

It was real when I ran into y'all, man. 
[02:18:30]  That was real, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I'd rather be here than be on the block.  That's a compliment, Anthony.  Tracy Morgan in the studio.

[02:19:00]  Giving us an education in the locker room.  It was so much fun.  After the game, we got an education.  That's right.  My man Biggie Smalls, God bless his dad, told me,  real people do real things.  Yeah.  If I wasn't going to really be there, I wouldn't have been there.  All of me was there.  Yep.  Absolutely.  We saw just about all of you.  They showed up, black, fat, flabby ass.  I got to get it together, brother.  I got to get it together, man.  I looked in the mirror in the locker room.  I got to get it together, man. 
[02:19:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think the chicks were digging you, though.  That's because I got that veteran body now.  You know?  I ran track in high school.  Yeah.  That was 20 years ago, man.  And it's starting to show?  Everybody don't get a pot belly.  That's inherited.  Yeah.  My grandfather passed that down to me.  Yeah.  Stretch marks and everything.  Gave you the pot belly?  Everything.  The witch's brew pot.  Witch's brew pot.  I was just talking to Tracy during commercials, and he was saying how he likes a chick, especially  on his porno tapes, to look like a regular chick.  And he enjoys the C-section scar? 
[02:20:00]  Stretch marks, C-section scars, and pimples on the boo-boo.  On the badonkadonk.  I don't like glamour.  I don't like the good.  There's one thing, glamour.  It makes it a little more real, right?  Come on.  Yeah, come on.  I like something that could actually, possibly live next door.  She's in the hallway dumping the garbage.  I'm in the hallway dumping the garbage, and things pop off.  So you see the girl at the C-section.  Yeah, I don't like amateurs, man.  No.  I'm amateurs.  I'm with you to a point.  It goes down to that R. Kelly thing, man, with a 14-year-old girl.  She was 14 years, but she wasn't no amateur. 
[02:20:30]  No.  She was not an amateur.  Our parents, check on your kids.  She'd be surprised with a 14-year-old nose.  R. Kelly didn't teach her that in that one sitting of that videotape.  When she had her hands up on that, looked like the mantle of a fireplace or whatever  the hell it was, and she was backing into him.  Oh, yeah.  I said, boo-boo, that looked like us.  I told my wife, that looked like us.  Beep.  Oh, yeah.  Beep, just backing right into it.  My son is 16.  He's starting to be into chicks now. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  He's 16.  He went in my stash the other day.  Got my porno tapes.  Went and took a look.  Yeah, because I know where I stopped the tape, you know?  Right where you finished.  I stopped the tape.  I didn't even get that far down.  Five minutes into it.  You stopped him right where you finished.  I come back home, and I'm three chicks down.  Right.  I have no relationship with these chicks yet.  It's like, what happened to the lesbian scene?  Yeah, what happened to that?  He was born through the lesbian scene on me.  Yeah, you know?  So I asked him.  I said, you know, he was embarrassed about it.  But, you know, my wife complained. 
[02:21:30]  And you never spend time with me and show business to him.  You don't teach him about the birds and the bees.  I don't have time for that.  So I just put the tape on and said, this is what we do.  Use a condom.  That's educational.  That's a lot of education.  That's the real Discovery Channel.  That's all the education they really need.  Come on.  What are you going to tell them?  And so I spoke to him.  Yeah.  And I asked everybody to leave the room because I don't want to embarrass my son.  I never want him to feel embarrassed about sex.  Right.  Sex, for you people out there that are embarrassed or afraid of sex, it's a beautiful thing. 
[02:22:00]  Please believe it.  Now, I'm like, so I'm like, do you like what you've seen on the tape?  And he's embarrassing.  Do you like what you see?  He finally said, yeah, I liked it, Dad.  I said, yeah.  I said, guess what?  He said, what?  I said, I know how to get it.  You don't.  Nor your friends.  Like the Wizard of Oz.  You want to go play PlayStation with your friends and ask you to spend quality time with Dad.  Why you never come hang around Dad?  Like, Dad is a lame now. 
[02:22:30]  I got info for you, baby.  I got the 411 on the cootie cat.  And he said, well, Dad, it was.  I said, well, that's an acquired taste.  Once you get used to it, it tastes just like chicken.  That's a little bit of a hurdle.  My wife said, you blow it, it's mine.  I said, fire is in my brain, stabbing me.  Agony.  Agony. 
[02:23:00]  Agony.  I see brothers out here and the weather's changing and these women just couldn't wait  to come out them clothes.  They had them outfits in the closet all winter long.  They wanted to show their stuff off.  Yeah, they played with them nipples before they walk out.  It's all torment.  Baby, don't fall for it.  It's all torment.  They trying to torment us.  They know.  Stay focused.  The lady in red.  The Matrix.  Believe it.  They know what it looks like.  What are you doing when you're on a hot seven train?  Hell yeah.  Bumping into me because I'm leaning against the door. 
[02:23:30]  Come on and kiss it and make it better.  One of the funniest things ever was when you were talking to everybody in the locker room  after the summer.  When we was rapping.  When you were talking about all the white guys who have never had the black.  The nappy dugout.  The nappy dugout.  The nappy dugout.  To change your life.  Make a white dude grow an afro.  To follow you.  And some pork chops.  And some pork chops that I burn.  You basically wanted all the white guys to follow you up to Harlem. 
[02:24:00]  That have never had the nappy dugout.  Yeah.  Don't be cheap.  Dick down deep.  Don't be cheap.  Come out your pocket.  White guys would be intimidated.  Same thing with black dudes.  Black dudes are intimidated too.  Because of the myth though, yeah.  Yeah.  But you know.  You know.  It's like.  It's like you get with a white chick.  And you're intimidated by the intelligence thing.  You know.  But in bed.  I don't get in bed with no.  And your money's on the dresser. 
[02:24:30]  I don't care about all that intellectual stuff.  You ain't got to impress me.  That's one way to put it.  Yeah.  It didn't make the radio.  But you make a good point.  I'm trying to get off, man.  Right.  That's all you care about.  Let's quit the shucking and jiving.  You don't want to grow a knowledge.  Just buy a small talk, man.  There you go.  Just make noise in the bed, man.  Be theatrical.  That's why we watch porno.  Because those ladies are theatrical.  They go off.  So they make them. 
[02:25:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I love that.  You like that good stuff?  Yeah.  It's intense.  We all love that.  When you're using the tape, though, and you got to, you know, take care of yourself, do  you fast forward and then pick the spot that you're going to use?  Absolutely.  Because you can't be tricked into going at it and then all of a sudden it's the guy's  face shot.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  No.  So you got to look at, you got to fast forward, look at what's coming up, look at the good,  pick your mark that you're going to use.  You got to time it out perfectly with what's going on on TV. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I don't want to finish at the same time.  Because if you're finishing with the red guy with his veiny neck going, oh, oh, it's  like, ah, Jesus Christ, man.  I like the surprise of the first time.  Nah.  Hey, you make a good point.  I do fast forward to figure out exactly where I want to end up.  Okay, I'm going to, this, this gives me, this gives me enough time to really go into  high gear.  And then you go back and you're like, okay, I got about four or five minutes to get to  that point.  Yeah.  Nice.  And it's a beautiful thing.  Of course.  I've been justified my porno collection because there's so much war around us. 
[02:26:00]  And I'd rather see lovemaking.  So you got more and more, you got more points.  Yeah, more of that stuff.  Us getting together.  Yeah.  Feet touching and stuff.  Veins and stuff.  It's good stuff.  Hey, I love that.  We got a guy that wants to talk to a really bad regular on our show.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, my two favorite crackers.  What's going on now?  What's up, Mike?  Tracy Morgan, yo, my nigga.  What's up, baby?  What's up, my nigga?  Yo, man, you've been putting it down for years, dog.  Yo, player, player, player, player.  Know that.  Please believe it.  Please believe it. 
[02:26:30]  That's right.  That's right.  Because she ain't making you enough.  Hold down.  That's right.  Back around, she ain't making you no money.  That's right, baby.  That's right.  You know?  There's two things.  And you got to fool these white boys or something about eating a booty.  Now, listen.  If you eat the booty, you got to understand you can't eat no shorty with no 40 because you  will drown up in that mud.  That's right.  That's right.  Yo, you heard that new song, right?  My head.  I told my head.  I said, you need to grow up.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  If you eat the coochie, the booty hole ain't but five inches away. 
[02:27:00]  Amen, brother.  Pretty crazy.  Booty hole don't go nowhere.  I don't know.  I'm about to send you off for now.  That's right.  Dumping.  Are they dumping there, Garrett?  Hold on.  They're dumping like crazy.  Are they dumping out of us?  How can they tell what's dirty?  I need a dictionary over here.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Stick, how many times they dump?  We were down to four seconds at one point.  Wow.  What?  We got to clean it up?  A little bit.  We're going to have to speak the clean English now. 
[02:27:30]  What, do we got a black guy to dump on?  He would be the only one that knows what's going on here.  I didn't know what they were talking about.  Did you, Ed?  I caught a little piece of it.  A little bit?  We were speaking properly.  I just want to know why.  All right, we're going to rewind a little bit because this is too good for the radio.  Why is it that common, I don't know, mythology that the black guys don't like going south?  Let's just say.  I don't know who created that, man. 
[02:28:00]  Really?  It ain't you, though, right?  Because my whole life changed.  I remember when this chick forced my head down there.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Now it tastes just like chicken.  Amen, amen.  Put a little hot pop up.  I'm a grown man.  Put a little hot pop up.  Right.  I take my sex serious.  I tape up, put the black stuff on my eyes and everything.  Stretch and everything.  Get ready for the game.  That's right.  It's for real.  It's for real.  You can't believe you're shorty with that 40, though.  That's right.  I love the 40, though. 
[02:28:30]  I like it naughty.  I said the thing.  They're scared of the big booty, bruh.  Nah, you can't be scared of the big booty.  You can't be scared of the big booty.  Man, slap it, flip it up, rub it down.  No, you can't say that either.  They don't like that either.  Yeah, they will dump out of that.  They don't like the T-word for that.  White guys like boobs.  Yeah.  White guys like the boobs.  The politically correct word for it is boobs.  I can talk for just about every white guy out there.  We don't like the big booty.  But that's not a bad thing.  That's just a difference.  Because brothers like butt, and white guys like boobs. 
[02:29:00]  That's not a bad thing.  That is not a bad thing.  Because this summer, I've just gotten into boobs.  I like the ass better.  I just started watching boobs.  I guess they walk around now, and they're just flowing so freely now.  Because we're in the midst of a sexual revolution.  They know they can do what they want to do.  And they're out.  But you know what I've started to do?  I've started to wear Speedos.  I went to the beach the other day, and we'll have my Speedos on gut, and people were vomiting 
[02:29:30]  and all that.  But I love me.  I love me.  I don't care.  Yeah, the good human man right there, too.  They are dumping out like crazy.  I'm going to say this, and I'm going to leave.  I'm going to leave.  I'm going to leave.  I understand this.  In order to appreciate the black booty, you have to smack it and ride the waves in.  See, that's a transportation mode.  When it comes down to it, you've got to work all that hard.  You've got to do a little pushing. 
[02:30:00]  I don't care what it's like.  As long as the brother, when you're black, white, Puerto Rico, whatever, as long as you  put in work.  Oh, yeah.  You're supposed to have the sweat dripping on the stomach or the booty.  It don't matter.  The sweat's supposed to drip off your chin.  You're supposed to put in work.  That's right, sir.  Put in work.  You could be three inches, but put in work.  Put in work.  Just put in work.  I just let everybody know to come in my bedroom.  I'm putting in work right now.  So if you've got somewhere to go, make a phone call or something. 
[02:30:30]  That's why it's called the bonnet room, baby.  I'm about to tell somebody here.  Period.  Strictly.  You keep putting it down, baby.  My man, I holler.  All right, now.  Make a light.  All right, now, sir, sir, sir, sir.  You know what?  I think I just watched the scene from Airplane.  Tracy, I've got to ask you this.  I wondered it.  A bunch of people probably asked it before.  When Britney Spears was on SNL and you said that fat ass.  You looked at her and went, oh, fat ass. 
[02:31:00]  And she made a look like I don't think fat had been in rehearsal or on the script.  Yeah, she took that in a way like I was complimenting her like, oh, that fat ass.  Right, right.  And she took it like, what?  But, yeah.  But I'm like, you're perfect.  I was watching that when it was live and I said, there is no way she knew that you were  going to say that or anyone else knew.  You seen her face?  Yeah, I looked at her face and was just like, holy Christ, she is pissed. 
[02:31:30]  That's the beauty of live television.  Did she say anything back to you?  What's she going to say?  Nothing.  Nothing.  You're going to take that fat ass and go to your dressing room.  Yeah, fat ass.  Because a lot of, yo, you are blessed.  She's blessed.  She's a beautiful woman, too.  Yeah.  Beautiful woman.  So cool, too, man.  She was a, she did the sketch with me.  She didn't have to.  Oh, yeah.  So she looked out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I got to kiss Britney like the following year. 
[02:32:00]  I kissed her.  And when I was doing Woodrow, that's something a lot of people in this world haven't done.  Yeah.  I had to rehearse with her.  That was good.  He said, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We want to listen to this.  That was nice, man.  Was that good?  Pretty.  Yeah.  No, breath, breath taste was smelling like cinnamon.  Really?  Yeah, man.  Like carnation milk, man.  This was soft.  I'm describing it to you, babe.  You know how we talk.  The dudes is talking.  Excuse us, y'all.  It was talking, man.  It was pretty.  And I got to do it.  I got the kisser like seven times. 
[02:32:30]  Was it getting worked up on you?  Were you feeling it?  Yeah.  Like down there?  Yeah.  Were you packing?  It jumped.  Uh-oh.  It's jumping.  It jumped.  A little jump.  A little wiggle?  Yeah.  A lot of people, a lot of the white guys were intimidated, too.  They were like, mother.  I got my head up like George, you know what I'm saying?  George Jefferson, you know?  I felt good.  You know, I was a cool dad, too, because my kids, he's like, damn, your pops kiss Britney  Spears.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  One of the highlights of my career.  Does your kids think you're still cool, Tracy? 
[02:33:00]  Come on.  No, they don't mess with me, man.  I'm just dad.  Yeah.  Every now and then, I get to be like, every now and then, I'm a cool dad.  Like if they meet like Jackie Chan or something like that.  Yeah, see, you can introduce them to some pretty cool people.  Yeah, so I'm a cool dad every now and then.  You're on TV every week, so.  You pick that.  That's pretty cool.  But other than that, they don't bother with me.  For the most part, they could care less, right?  You're just a dad.  They've been around it so long.  They've been around it so long.  It's just like that's dad.  And, you know, that's the way I wanted at home.  That's his job.  I don't have to do no dancing or all of that at home. 
[02:33:30]  So, yeah, that's a cool part of that, you know?  We got another brother calling in.  I didn't realize all the brothers listened to the O.P. Anthony show.  Of course.  What?  We know Malik.  Malik!  You know what?  Yo, what's the deal, Tracy Moe, from the project?  Yo!  What's the deal?  Yo, Sean, what's the deal?  Yo, I totally feel you on that Britney Spears.  Yo, her ass is so big.  She got the ass like the sister, Badonkadonk.  But check this out.  Open handy.  They don't know how many brothers and sisters listen to their show, yo.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I heard mad.  They gave me mad love, yo, like last week. 
[02:34:00]  Yo, I heard about it from mad people.  That's love.  I had to come through.  I was hoping for y'all to call me.  They know brothers got love for them.  I call Ted all the time, man.  Malik calls all the time, man.  Yeah, no doubt.  And he's in Asbury Park, and that is some nice area.  And I can't remember how that tape.  You like Britney Spears, bro?  No doubt.  Come on.  Son, you got to see her in person, though, because when she walked, I call it the Badonkadonk,  yo, because each cheek just went Badonkadonk.  Badonkadonk.  I would have loved if you just smack her right on the left side of her cheek or something, 
[02:34:30]  son.  Come on.  Justin wasn't having that, son.  I got my respect for son, yo.  That was his joint.  Yeah.  He was on the set, and he had his game face on.  He was there with her, yeah.  Yeah.  Yo, you know what I mean, brother?  Was he looking out?  Cats was trying to push up on that.  Who what?  Cats around the studio was trying to holler at that.  Yeah, they were trying to holler at her.  And he was trying to pull that like a hamstring.  Look at you, Britney.  What's up?  We don't try to step forward.  We don't try to step forward.  We don't care. 
[02:35:00]  No, I think I would want J-Lo, though, son.  Yeah.  I got a thing for Boricuas.  I couldn't even go to the Puerto Rican Day Parade, man.  I just don't want to be coochie-strung no more, man.  What I'm going to do is sit around and watch it.  They ain't messing with me.  They ain't bold enough to mess with a celebrity.  Son, I was at the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  I was messing up all of the celebrity brothers.  Like, see?  Give them a little money and some fame, and look what they do.  It was lovely at the show parade.  Sometimes it hurts.  Hey, Malik.  You just don't videotape it.  Yo.  You done, Malik?  Yeah, Tracy.  I hold it down for the PJs, homeboy. 
[02:35:30]  Huh?  I hold it down for all the PJs and all the ghetto fabulous brothers.  And you know this.  And O&A, yo, you got your brothers listening.  Yo, we hold you down, too.  You know what I mean?  He know that.  That ain't even an issue, baby.  Word.  Big ol' PJs.  You're on the radio every day.  Word.  Malik.  Thanks a lot, man.  Yo, you hear them trying to talk black, Malik?  I'm down with that.  I'm going to corrupt y'all whole time.  Yeah.  But you know what the deal is with me?  You know, yo, Malik, mind you know how I'm making it work,  and I can run in all these different circles? 
[02:36:00]  I learn how to be white boy cool.  Learn how to stay awesome.  And dude, white boy cool, baby.  I have never used awesome.  I go on auditions.  They don't know I'm black.  Tracy Morgan is like a female Irish name.  And I get the director and the guests, and they'll be like, wait a minute.  But you're like a real black guy.  We have a fake black guy that works around here.  Oh, my God.  Like Earl.  Earl.  Earl is the furthest from the ghetto that you can get. 
[02:36:30]  Earl is from Queens.  He must be totally white boy.  Yeah.  He's from Forest Hills.  He's sad.  But we could use him.  We could use him.  Yeah?  Yeah, you could use him.  I like hanging out with the real black brother.  You know it.  And they're like original people.  I wish we would have got to meet Bruce Lee, baby.  Bruce?  Yeah.  That would have been all right.  I don't know, though.  Bruce?  Yeah, I think the movies made him look a lot better than he probably really was.  In real life, right?  Yeah, you can't pull all that karate stuff like that live.  I don't know.  He might have been the only one that could do it. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'll tell you one thing.  I ought to roll a blunt with him.  I'm trying to get him to smoke some weed or something.  Yo, Bruce, come on.  Smoke a blunt.  Let me see you do all that karate stuff now, man.  Still people getting into that on the SNL cast?  What?  You know, drugs have been a part of the SNL cast for many years.  Let me tell you something about the cast and SNL, man.  I have my own friends.  Yeah.  You know, we all professionals, and I don't know what they do.  Yeah, that's a good answer.  I do my dirt all by my lonely.  I know that. 
[02:37:30]  He's a smart guy.  I know I do my dirt all by my lonely.  You're not going to get an answer.  I don't know.  Are you what I'm saying?  You know, we all drink.  We all get our drunk on.  I see him at the wrap party, but then after 4 o'clock, I disappear and retreat to my castle.  You know?  Yeah.  I can't...  I mean, with all due respect to white people, I can't really party with white people because  they remind me of work too much.  Really?  Yeah, man.  You remind me of work.  I'll be partying and drinking, and then I see a white dude with a suit on.  I'll be like, I got to get back to work. 
[02:38:00]  Pardon me.  Where's my mom?  Where's my broom?  What's wrong with us?  No, y'all cool.  Y'all cool.  Y'all got the paper.  Y'all pick up the check for everything.  I love that.  We're trying to understand.  I love that.  That's a beautiful thing, but yo, wait a minute.  Y'all got to have some of the words into my vocabulary.  You got to.  Being around me, you going to watch.  Watch if you say, yo, son.  So, no, they do.  Yo, son.  How about this one?  I got some cheddar.  Oh, please.  I'm leaving the studio.  You sad.  One of the guys downstairs told me to say paper. 
[02:38:30]  Paper.  Oh, now it's paper?  You got to get paper.  So, cheddar's now old school for money?  Cheddar's crazy old school.  Oh.  Cheddar was out with Sugar Hill Gang, man.  You can't keep up.  That went out with the Sugar Hill Gang.  Paper.  Yo, pimps up, hoes down.  If a dude can't swim, he bound to drizzle.  You guys should put out a little paper or something telling us, like, what's cool and what's not.  I got you.  We could kind of keep up a little bit.  No, because by the time white folk get it in their vocabulary, it's over.  It's over, right? 
[02:39:00]  But wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  And I can't do that because then I'm, you know, it's like that new movie, Wind Talkers.  Yeah.  Y'all might be trying to decipher our codes.  The code.  The Navajo code.  I could talk to a juror.  If I ever go on trial, I'd be talking to a juror.  Ebonics.  And the judge won't understand nothing.  I could get him to take a bribe.  Right.  The judge won't understand nothing.  Him.  You see, I said nothing.  Nothing.  Him, the DA, and defense lawyer. 
[02:39:30]  Well, give us one of the, give us something cool today.  I'm going to give you something cool right now.  Give us one thing that'll make it sound cool if we run into a few brothers on the street.  I'm going to give you a nice, cool...  See, I thought cheddar was it.  Oh, jeez.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This is a cool word.  When you want to get your drink on...  How about hoopty?  Oh, my goodness.  What's wrong with the hoopty?  No, no, no, no.  Hoopty.  Say hoop.  Now you got to say hoop.  It's called hoop.  Which is a car.  Now I got a word for you that's going to be fly.  It's when you want to go get your beer on or go get your smoke on. 
[02:40:00]  It's called getting it crunk.  Wow.  He gave us one.  Get it crunk.  Get it crunk.  And then you go, yo, it's getting cloudy in here.  Huh?  No, I just said crunk.  I was like, nah.  Well, we were hanging out at the VMAs.  And the guys, they were smoking the big blunts.  And also one guy goes, yo, it's getting cloudy.  He said that?  Yeah.  He must have been a college student.  Oh, man.  You're as hip-hop as Joseph Goebbels. 
[02:40:30]  You live in an all-white dorm.  So cloudy's not cool anymore?  If you want to get...  No, crunk is cool.  Crunk is cool.  All right.  Remember crunk.  If you want to go, like...  He's probably lying to stuff.  If you're going to go lay down with a chick, like a female, then you say, I'm going to  go, um...  You say, I'm going to go, um...  I'm going to get my F on.  No, I'm going to go hit my skins.  Go hit the skins.  Hitting skins.  Hit the skins.  Yeah.  He's smirking, though.  I don't know.  I don't know if he's giving us a pound on that.  If you just say, get it, get up in them guts.  Wait, man.  He's... 
[02:41:00]  Get up in them guts.  That's good.  Don't get up in them guts, man.  About to get in them guts.  I like that one.  He's going to get up in them guts.  He's smirking, though.  I don't know if he's giving us the good stuff.  No, I'm giving you the good stuff somewhere.  Just like a white guy like me  going into one of your neighborhoods  trying to get a little something  telling me it's the good stuff.  I get back to my crib  and it's not the good stuff.  I know.  I'm not going to stare you wrong.  I'm going to stare you strong.  How about crib?  Is crib still cool?  Crib is good.  All right.  That's always good.  It's one of the classics.  Yeah, crib is a classic.  That ain't going nowhere. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Word.  I hope he's just afraid these words  and ends up like, you know...  But if Ope ever comes to the hood,  you know you're going to holler at his boy.  But that's the number one holler.  Yeah?  Gotta holler.  Holla?  Not holler.  You want to get laid?  Yeah.  You want to get laid?  Just holler at me first.  Yo, Trey, I'm on 116 for Lennox.  I'll be down there in a minute.  I like the nappy dugout thing.  Yeah, nappy dugout.  I've been using the nappy dugout thing.  Yeah, that's the taco right there, B.  We call it the beef patty  when she got the fat cootie cat.  That's called a beef patty. 
[02:42:00]  With Coco Brad.  Fat cootie.  Yeah.  Lil' Kim joint, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it is.  Lil' Kim's got the fat one.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Yeah, you see it on the award shows.  You got the grundes, grundes.  I like that fat one.  You like the fat one, Norton, huh?  Yo, you got to see the Dominicans up in Washington Heights, B.  Yeah.  Oh, man, they got it going on.  But whoever said white chicks ain't got ass,  yo, lied, yo.  Because this is all the mythological cats is comical.  Mythological cats is comical.  I'll be like, yo, I know some white chicks 
[02:42:30]  that got a what?  Banging.  Banging.  Straight junk in your junk back there.  Yeah?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  But usually they got the rest to match.  What?  It's not like a J-Lo, you know,  where she just got the ass  and then the rest of her is like hot, you know?  And they got the little suntan to go along with it.  Yeah.  But I can never get what I want.  I can never get like,  I wouldn't want a white chick to act black.  I would want a white chick to act white.  Right.  Like, we not even belong together.  We don't even belong together. 
[02:43:00]  Like, people look at us and go,  I don't know how to act.  We're two different worlds.  Yeah, but the world to lie is a beautiful thing.  It's destructive.  You're right.  It'll be destructive.  That's why I want a black.  It'll destroy both our lives.  She'll get kicked out of the wheel.  I won't be allowed on the black no more.  But we took the struggle.  Right.  That's why I want...  We fought through all the red tape and all of that.  Like, if you had a black girl named Shawanda...  That's why I want a black girl.  But you've got to get a black girl.  Oh, he always talks about this.  I want a black, they look purple. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And with braids and extensions and all of that.  Attitude, too.  See, that's the thing that's going to turn you on.  You know how fair.  It's going to be the sex.  It's going to be the attitude.  You know how black I want her?  You want the hair moving.  Yeah, that attitude.  You know how black I want her?  Mickey Rivers black.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Mickey Rivers black.  That ain't black.  That's African.  Yeah.  Black, man.  That's back to the Congo, baby.  That doesn't get much black.  That's Mickey Rivers black, baby.  You want something from the jungle.  I thought you was talking about something from the ghetto. 
[02:44:00]  You want to go to the jungle, brother.  You want to be Tarzan on it.  You want to go to the Congo with it.  That's where you look and the contrast.  You want to smell like Africa and everything.  Yeah, I do.  The contrast between you and her is just too much for your eyes to even take, you know?  Man, man.  And then you just finish up all over the back.  And it's a beautiful thing when we're in bed together.  Yeah.  You see, what we're trying to do is definitely break that negative perception that we have  of everybody.  There's only one way to do that.  That's in the bed. 
[02:44:30]  That's effing.  There's only one way to do it.  I'm permitting this.  We've got to come together.  I hope they ain't dumping on us, man.  No, you're doing good now.  No, they're good.  The first 20 minutes, which was hilarious, didn't make the air, but this is making it.  He knows.  He's on a live show.  This is just for the record.  He's on the live show every week.  They're going to play this stuff for me when I get on the E! Channel.  They're going to have the nice silhouette background, and you're going to be saying,  well, Tracy, when he first came in, he was a great dude, didn't he?  You know what happened?  Got to make the tabloids, baby. 
[02:45:00]  I want to be bigger than Bobby Brown.  Then it all went wrong.  The biggest celebrity in the world is Bobby Brown.  Bobby!  You like it, Bobby?  I love you and Whitney.  I love Bobby.  Man, he's destroying that girl.  I think they're fighting for that love.  Fighting for that love?  Oh, yeah.  I think they're fighting for the glass pipe whenever you see her.  Yo, that fessed me up when I heard about that with Whitney, somebody breaking in the crib.  Come on, man.  You're Whitney Houston, man.  Come on, man.  She sweats like nobody's business.  And then you turn around, Mariah. 
[02:45:30]  Look at Mariah.  Yeah.  Mariah.  She lost a mind.  If you're going to do Barbra Streisand, do Barbra Streisand.  Don't do Little Kim no more.  Do Barbra.  Go Barbra Streisand.  Do the coat and put the night evening gown on and go sing the hits.  I think that is so hot how she was in her nightgown just losing her mind, throwing plates  against the walls and freaking out.  And the cheeks.  Oh, half-naked.  Just a side of her.  Yeah.  The side.  A boot pops out.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Hanging out the side.  She's crying.  That's why we love when females fight.  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  We love that.  Because the winner's the one who will pop out.  And they keep fighting.  That's good stuff.  That's commitment.  That's good stuff.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Tracy Morgan in the studio.  Phones have gone crazy.  And they're all black guys.  That's a good thing or a bad thing?  A couple white guys.  Oh, Bling Bling.  Is that still good?  Bling Bling is the name of a culture now.  It used to be fresh.  Now it's Bling Bling.  Yeah.  We're getting money now.  Paper.  We're getting paper now.  What about ice?  How about ice?  You got some ice?  Ice.  That's frozen. 
[02:46:30]  My wrist is first force bit.  Thank you, Jake DeJua.  His wrist is frozen.  My wrist is frost bit.  We dig all the ice out of the tunnels in Africa.  Oh, my God.  All the black men down there in those diamond mines just dying.  Spitting black spit.  Getting their feet chopped off so they don't run off with the booty.  So I could get some booty.  Oh, hell yeah.  It's amazing what goes on in those diamond mines.  What we do to do what we got to do.  I got to do what I got to do. 
[02:47:00]  I get the ice to get the attention in the club.  I'm not a hunk.  Right.  I'm not a hunk.  I'm going to do what I have to do to survive.  If I don't get laid, I will die.  There's nothing like having it on your hands.  You drive home biting that same nail.  I'm nervous of you.  I'm sick of people acting like it don't exist.  All right.  Hold on.  It exists.  That's one they will love.  It's here.  They will dump out of that.  So why don't we just take a break and we'll regroup. 
[02:47:30]  I should have read that article.  We're going to give you some radio rules.  Okay.  And then we got this guy who came up with this black man game.  I don't even know what this is about.

[02:59:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony rock.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How about that, huh?  On YST.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio today, our new friend, Tracy Morgan.  What up?  What up?  We met him at the softball game.  We hit it off.  And we said, come on, Tracy.  Come on in and do some radio with us.  And he's killing us today.  Tracy Morgan, he's going to be on Comedy Central  doing his own thing August 26th.  And then he's going to be hosting the Comic Groove  on Comedy Central on August 28th. 
[03:00:00]  No doubt.  And he's got some theories on the Tyson fight.  Well, I thought it was a fix.  You thought the Tyson fight was a fix.  Yeah, because he whooped Lennox Lewis' butt in the first round  and then he just stopped throwing punches.  I said, oh, this is the thing about this is where the rematch comes in.  I'm not paying another $60 in pay-per-view for that, man.  You thought they were doing it to like...  Yeah, man.  Come on.  Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson.  Ain't no boxer ever going to beat Mike Tyson, man.  He's too good for that.  Mike Tyson got beat by Robert Givens, man.  She ain't laying a glove on him. 
[03:00:30]  I'm telling you, don't get coochie whipped out there.  He said that was the best punch he ever threw in his life, he said.  Oh, yeah.  She put it on him.  The one that he punched.  She put it on him.  She probably gave him the bionic head and everything.  You know something, though?  Bionic.  Think of Mike Tyson, and then you hear him say the best punch he ever threw was the one  he threw into her face.  Imagine the look on her face when Mike's big, fat fist went right into her face.  Well, you know how she became trifling, too, because I'm the biggest Mike Tyson fan, but 
[03:01:00]  she's trifling.  She got it for my mama.  You know, remember when Dave Winfield burned to her mother?  Gave a clap.  And we became public knowledge.  Dave Winfield, you ain't a phone unless you get clapped.  You got to get burnt, man, once and twice, man.  Yeah.  That means you ain't boning.  That's embarrassing, though.  I'd rather get clapped than crabs, though.  Crabs are irritating.  You'd be scratching all day before you know what's going on, man. 
[03:01:30]  What's the best STD to get if you're in the public eye, though?  And it comes out in the news.  What's the best is none?  Chlamydia?  You had to get one.  Get chlamydia, man.  Chlamydia.  Chlamydia.  You can wash that off without being so prepared to the stuff that's out there now.  Crabs got the bad news.  Now you just get a big bubble on the side of your thing, man.  You like that cake on the little rascals.  Rip-rap.  Oh, la-la-la-la.  You like that cake on the little rascals?  Oh, yeah.  Rip-rap.  Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Dave Winfield got clapped. 
[03:02:00]  Gave clapped to Robin Gibbons' moms.  You can't.  Dave got an apology card from Hallmark and stuff.  Sorry for giving you a clap.  You can't get the crabs off.  Because you took them crabs off and they'd just be swimming around in the toilet like this.  Because they'd be surviving, right?  You get crabs that are written about you in the paper that you got crabs?  That just means you're banging some really skank.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Skank bitches.  Hanging out with a kick rockin' them, man.  Syphilis, though?  Yeah.  Anyone could get that, right?  You can't fall in love with a stripper, either, man. 
[03:02:30]  He's crazy.  My boy fell in love with a stripper, man.  I said he was crazy.  Yeah.  Strippers are crazy.  Oh, yeah, they are.  I just get annoyed by them sometimes at the club.  You know something?  I say this all the time.  Don't talk to me, man.  Just go over there.  Shut up and dance.  Yeah.  That's it.  I don't want to hear.  Don't bother me.  Don't cover up when the music isn't playing and they cover up, all of a sudden they're shy.  Yeah.  If there's no two in play.  And then they're like, well, I got a daughter and I'm going through school.  I'm trying to shut up.  You are here in this club because you let hard times take over. 
[03:03:00]  Don't blame it on your daughter, man.  That's right.  And don't blame it on your mom's having leukemia.  Just shut up and dance.  And I'm trying to make it better for you by paying you a couple of bucks.  So dance.  That's right.  We don't care if you go to Bronx Community College.  Yeah.  I'm going to notice how intelligent you are and your boobs are sitting right in my face,  man.  And I'm supposed to focus just on you and there's like 20 other naked women around me?  Yeah.  Don't be cheap.  You know, don't be greedy.  Have some humanity in this strip club.  That's classic.  There has to be humanity here, too. 
[03:03:30]  Hey, Tracy.  Our black guy has a ride.  Oh, yo, he was dead into the game.  Sounded like he had a contract or something.  Yeah, Earl.  He was playing for a trophy.  Earl knows how to play the ball.  Earl was stretched and everything.  He, like, did laps around and feeling everything.  Tracy, can you help us out in blacking him up a little bit?  I'm going to bring him up town with me.  He has nothing.  You're the whitest black guy we know.  Screw you.  We want you more like Tracy.  Screw you.  Yeah, he really don't have it.  We want you to be more like Tracy.  Screw you, man.  You don't have it.  Self-righteous bullcrappy. 
[03:04:00]  Where are you from, Earl?  There you go.  I'm going to bring you.  I should have brought him a plate.  Bang.  Get a plate for Earl.  Tell him where you're from, Earl.  Corona.  Where are you from?  Corona.  Yeah.  Corona.  Where's that at?  Queen.  Hey, Earl, give us some slang.  Tracy's been giving us slang for the last hour here.  You know when he's slang?  Exactly.  Not the news.  It changes every week.  Well, give us something.  You know, though.  Earl, can I ask you a question, Pop?  I don't mean to put you on the spot.  You be going to strip clubs?  Yeah, he goes to strip clubs.  I know you ain't no bad boy.  I tell you, have you ever been locked up? 
[03:04:30]  No.  No.  I got to work on you.  You don't got a record?  Martin Luther King had a record, man.  Martin Luther King had a record.  Yeah.  You got to get a record, baby.  You got to go through, at least go through the system.  Once.  At least.  You grew up on welfare?  No.  Oh, man.  You don't know nothing about the project.  I'm telling you.  You ever been drawn out of the wall?  That's infamous in Project Elevator. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Drawed out of the wall, the elevator.  Earl, you have no idea about that?  Hold on, Tracy, because I know they jumped out of that, too, unfortunately.  I am so sorry, man.  That I do know of that.  My mouth is...  You know about that?  Yeah.  You're talking about the elevators and the projects.  The elevators in my building.  They have drawings of guys' junk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  It happens in my building now.  All right.  Oh, sure it goes, Earl.  Yes, it does.  You still live in Corona?  Yeah.  Okay.  Is that good, Trace? 
[03:05:30]  Corona's cool.  It's Queens.  It's out of the way.  You know, it's not...  He ain't dug down or nothing.  The girls are right, though.  Yeah.  He's athletic.  Good kid.  Good kid.  Brother from Queens doesn't...  He ain't never had a clap or nothing.  Yeah.  He ain't a veteran.  He's still a rookie, though.  He's in the minors, still?  He's got to come up from the far, so, yeah.  You ever have the crabs, Earl?  That's a thing, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, I can't say that.  Okay.  You ever had...  You ever had...  You ever had the...  You ever had the dunk in the trunk?  Earl, do you... 
[03:06:00]  Do you ever have the brown eye?  The brown eye.  That's good.  You ever had some brown eyes?  You're scared.  You take a taste of the balloon?  Ladies.  Ladies out there.  The dirty penny?  Earl said he's willing to taste the brown eye.  No.  No?  What's wrong?  No, he's drinking that water, boy.  You know how I suck on the dirty penny?  He drinks a lot of water when he gets nervous.  No, I was in the van with no air conditioning.  He taught us today that we're close enough.  You've got to make the commitment. 
[03:06:30]  Got to make the commitment.  When you're there, you're close enough to the other, so you should make the commitment.  It's right there.  It's right there.  It's only, what did you say, four or five?  He is so shy.  Look at him, man.  Yeah.  That is so cool.  Earl gets a little embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed, baby.  I'm not embarrassed.  We all men in here.  Wow.  That was enough.  He's exhausted.  Earl, you got anything?  No, I'm exhausted.  Ben just...  We just came back from getting the new guy. 
[03:07:00]  I don't know what to say.  No, no, no.  I'll do it.  We have to put it off on Ben and...  Why are you guys doing this to me, man?  Why'd you bring a real black guy up in here, man?  No, you're real, brother.  You're cool.  He's all right, but he's not black.  He's just a brother from a different mother.  I used to hang out with the fake black guys in my high school, too.  I thought they had something until...  We said this the other day.  I played a lot of hoops growing up.  It was one of my first loves.  And I learned what the real black guys were all about when we went to the projects in 
[03:07:30]  the hood to play some hoops.  Then I knew my guys were fake black guys.  They had nothing.  Suburban.  Yeah, they were suburban.  You know you keep it real.  Give me a pound, man.  Uh-oh.  Does he know what to do?  Even though you didn't say nothing...  Oh, they're going for a handshake.  Even though you didn't say nothing to me at the baseball game, bro.  I hope I didn't embarrass you.  That's not true.  All right, Ant, what's up?  Ant.  Yo, what up?  We're talking to Tracy Morgan.  What's going on, Trey?  What up, baby?  Yo, baby bop.  I saw you in some real hard spots in the Bronx, man. 
[03:08:00]  What bricks you hold on your sights is that, baby?  Uh, say that again?  What bricks you from?  I'm from Brooklyn.  But I'm up in the Bronx, too, though.  Wait a minute.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, and I grew up in the Bronx.  That's where I learned to hustle.  Yeah, because I don't see you, man.  And I keep it real by myself, bro.  That's right.  Because I'm not show business.  I know.  And, yo, it was just last year.  I ain't going to put your whip on fast.  But you might be talking about Club Roomba or something.  Nah, baby.  Listen, I ain't going to put your whip on blast, but you had some nice shoes on that green piece, 
[03:08:30]  though.  Yeah.  You see that, right?  Oh, yeah.  You was real good.  Yeah, I'm grabbing that right.  You was real good to the kids, too.  Yeah, no doubt.  No doubt.  The Jag.  I had the Jag.  They was loving you, dog.  My man.  My man.  All right.  I'll try to keep it moving.  I know that, baby.  All right.  Holla.  All right.  Yo, yo, Jim, what up?

[03:09:00]  Nah, that's hood language, man.  Son, they love that, though.  But that's a beautiful thing, though, right there.  You know what I'm saying?  They love that right there.  You're like secret agents.  Yeah.  All I knew was I was supposed to be quiet there.  And, you know, this is a whole new dynamic now.  You know what I'm saying?  This is a whole new dynamic, too.  Hey, yo, you got...  They're going to take over and end up at Trey's spot.  They're going to have an all-black audience.  All right.  Yeah, sir.  Thank you.  Ain't nothing to talk about Trey, either, man.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Jimmy, what bricks do you throw down your ciphers on?  I don't know a word they said to each other. 
[03:09:30]  I'm just sitting here like a white, chinless nothing.  He asked him what neighborhood he's from, and he had some good shoes on with his...  Is that an outfit or something?  No, that was my car.  My rims on my car.  Oh.  Ah.  The shoes.  The rims.  There you go.  You see, but you know what?  You know what's so crazy?  Because when I first got on SNL, man, it was like a coaching shock.  Yeah.  It took me at least two years, man, to get white boy cool, man.  Now I'm white boy cool and the audience love me.  You know what I'm saying?  So it's a beautiful thing there, man.  You're supposed to embrace everything. 
[03:10:00]  I'm scared of that.  Embrace.  What is white boy cool?  White boy cool is what...  White boy, see, I learned how to be white boy cool, not from the show.  But from the after parties.  Yeah.  Yeah, I learned how to party like a white boy, too.  White boys party.  In what way?  Oh, you have to go down.  You throw down the beers, right?  All of that.  Everything.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Some of the black guys.  I think black guys...  But black guys, wait a minute.  Black guys...  You smoke more weed than...  Sometimes...  Yeah, we smoke weed, but black guys, we just...  We more concerned with our style. 
[03:10:30]  Now, I can't spill no drink on my brand new gators.  White guy don't care.  That's cool, isn't it?  So you got to know how to run in both circles.  So if I'm going to bring you uptown, I got to get you a pair of gators.  Just, you know, know how to walk.  We're going to call you white chocolate.  You know what I'm saying?  That's hilarious.  Fimself hold down.  If a brother can't swim, he bound to drizzle.  You're so right.  If a white guy's in a partying mood, it doesn't matter what he has on.  He doesn't care what he messes up.  Or out.  Black people, we worrying about our hair. 
[03:11:00]  Ladies are worrying about their hair getting messed up.  I just got my hair done out of my nails.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't mean to make it sound like we superficial jerks, but it's just two different cultures.  You know, we're more concerned with, you know, going home in the crease still being in my pants.  Keith has a question, and this has been brought up many times on the show.  Keith?  Yes, sir.  What's up?  Tracy, big fan.  Listen, I'm curious.  You ever ask your wife, like, when she's on top, with a little nigger in it?  Excuse me?  Say that again. 
[03:11:30]  We've heard this, Tracy.  You know, I dated a black girl, and one night, and then I asked her, you know, she was on top,  with a little nigger in it, and she hit me upside the head with a friend there,  and I'm wondering if everything like that happened to you.  You probably shouldn't say that then.  You know, you just hooked up with a black chick.  You know.  Yeah.  You probably shouldn't say that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You probably shouldn't say that.  Oh, don't you see that?  No, that doesn't work for you?  You never heard that in the hood?  No.  Put a little, uh...  No.  Put a little nigger in it?  No.  Yeah.  I never heard that.  I'm going to shake it up. 
[03:12:00]  No.  Yeah.  I never heard nothing like that.  Yeah.  It's probably best you don't say it if you're a white dude and just picked up some black chick.  What do you say when you're banging a Jewish girl?  Just step into the shower?  She'd probably charge you much if you say that to her, baby.  Joe from Portland.  What's up, Joe?  Yeah.  Hey, Tim.  I mean, were you pleased or disappointed in the performance of the ladies' man in the studio?  Did you anticipate bigger box office on that?  Tim or Trey?  That's very funny, you ass.  No.  Are you the buckwheat guy or the baseball been very, very good to me? 
[03:12:30]  Which one are you again?  I'm none of that, man.  I'm brand new, man.  I'm Tracy Morgan.  Tracy's been doing much better than those guys.  How long have you been on?  How long have you been on, man?  I've been on six years.  Six years.  Yeah.  I guess I'm the guy they love to hate, so.  No, that's Portland.  You are.  Brewer told us a story once that you guys were hanging out.  And Brewer goes, and somebody got shot when you two were hanging out.  When we was up in Harlem.  No, we was working.  We wasn't hanging out.  We was working on Uptown Comedy Club. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  And we went outside for a break and somebody got shot.  Supposed to that gunfire when I was like four or five years old.  That's what he said.  He goes, you know, you knew just to stay away from it.  I knew what caliber of gun it was.  And Brewer's saying, he was like, come on, let's go look.  I'm like, no, let's chill.  Yeah.  No, you don't go toward, you don't run toward the gunfire.  It's all right.  But I taught him a lot of stuff when he was up in Harlem.  Yeah.  I taught him a lot of stuff.  That was my dog, though.  Yeah.  Brewer's a good guy.  Jim kept it so real. 
[03:13:30]  We was in the middle.  We was on that TV show.  We was in the middle of Harlem.  And he stayed himself.  And that's why I stayed myself.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't get shook.  I don't get shook around black people or white people.  I just love human beings.  All right.  Are we going to talk to Chuck Sawyer?  The guy that invented the black man game.  We can do that after break.  Yeah.  It's been sitting in the office for a while.  That is some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's like, is it a joke or is it serious or I have no idea. 
[03:14:00]  I want to talk to the guy about this.  It's the black man game.  And we'll talk to Chuck Sawyer next.  Okay.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone.  You want some of this.  Oh.

What the F was he just saying?  I would never know to look for that.  What was he saying, though?  He's a perceptive guy.  Some chick in his neighborhood in Brooklyn.  Yeah?  When I was 17, yeah.  And she had a, what do they call that, with the hole in the neck? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, like a tracheotomy here.  Tracheotomy.  A tracheotomy.  A tracheotomy.  She had the band-aid.  And she had the little band-aid right there, and we was in love.  You know, I made her feel we was in love, but I had to hold on.  She was getting that money, that check.  He knew that she was getting money from somewhere.  My mother told me she got that money coming.  Because of the accident.  From that accident.  If you looked around and saw a chick with something wrong with her body,  she got money coming in.  You'd think, I would never think that. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, hook up with her because she's got a check coming.  Don't overlook them women with the prosthetics and stuff, man.  That one arm.  The fake leg.  That leg got to get ripped off somehow.  That's a steady check.  That leg got to get ripped off in some machine that is a company that has a lot of money.  Somebody had to push you off that platform.  Don't just walk out on it because she's missing something.  You got to look at it.  You might fall in love with that cold piece of plastic setting up against you.  You got to look at the upside of that.  She got that steady check.  You don't got to worry.  Right.  You're your house husband. 
[03:24:00]  Go on Oprah.  Take your shoes off and cry.  You'll be a star.  I can't argue that one.  That is brilliant.  The pain.  The pain of dating a woman with a prosthetic.  Hey, Mike has a question.  Mike E.  Goddamn brilliant.  Mike E.  Real fast.  We're trying to fit you in, Mike.  You there?  The pain.  No pain, no gain, baby.  Tracy, Mike wants to ask, how come guys in the projects like to take a leak in the elevator?  Yeah, there you go.  How come guys in the projects take a leak?  Well, I don't live in the projects no more and I still leak in the elevator.  It's not just dudes in the projects. 
[03:24:30]  We all leak in the elevator.  You got to go.  You got to go.  Yeah, I live down in the city and I still leak in the elevator.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Awesome.  Wait a minute.  Oops.  Oops.  All right, listen.  Chuck Sawyer's been on hold for like an hour.  Chuck.  Yeah, let's talk to Chuck, man.  Hey, Chuck.  Yo, yo.  Opie Anthony.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Tracy, what's up, man?  What's up, baby?  Now, Chuck Sawyer, you invented the black man game.  I did. 
[03:25:00]  Life is a black man in the game.  All right.  Why don't you explain it for the people that haven't seen it yet?  Sure.  Life is a black man in the game is the first and only board game to portray life from the  perspective of a minority.  And in the game, all the players are playing the role of an 18-year-old black male fresh  out of high school.  And the object of the game is to be the first player to get the freedom, which is at the  top of the board.  So in the very beginning of the game, players are going to roll the dice to determine what  their character type is going to be.  So either you'll be creative, intellectual, or athletic, then you'll roll the dice again 
[03:25:30]  to determine where you're going to begin the game.  So if you roll a one or a two, you start in the ghetto.  If you roll a three, you start in military.  If you roll a four or five, you start in black university.  And if you roll a six, you start in glamourwood, which is the entertainment industry, you know,  Hollywood.  Right.  So you're working your way up the board, and you would choose one column on the game  board.  You'll see there are a myriad of spaces all over the place, and it's like career, crime,  police, racism, life, payday, church, corporate America, spaces for each district that you're 
[03:26:00]  in.  Whatever space you land on, you're going to pull that card, and real-life instances are  going to be read, and you're going to basically do whatever the card's telling you to do.  And all the players are racing to be the first players to get the freedom.  And at any time during the game, you can go to church just by saying, I want to go to  church.  And when you go to church, all good things are going to happen.  So the church might take up an offering for you, your pastor might talk to the judge on  your behalf, you know, you might get a college scholarship, but all good things happen when 
[03:26:30]  you go to church.  And who's this game made by, Milton Bradley?  I made it.  That's me, Chuck Sawyer.  Wow.  Who's going to sell it?  Who's going to distribute it?  Well, right now we're distributing it through our website, blackmangame.com, and through mom  and pop stores, so we're upgrading the packaging to go ahead and put it, you know, on Walmart,  Toys R Us, KB Toys, Barnes & Noble, those kind of stores.  It's definitely interesting to see you, that you still see that the struggle is black and 
[03:27:00]  white.  Well, it's even more so than even being black and white.  Well, don't you think it's economics?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And I think that that's the underlying theme, that minorities are discriminated against,  and the life that we live is the same as life that everyone else lives, except we have  to deal with racism.  We have to deal with bad police, and in the game, we demonstrate how that's a setback.  You say that it's hard for a black man in the land of milk and honey because we ain't  allowed in that land because we're lactose intolerant and number one in diabetes? 
[03:27:30]  Hey, I think it gets even deeper than that.  I hear that.  Hey, Chuck, but you start off as an 18-year-old high school graduate, black high school graduate?  Yeah.  But don't black guys graduate high school when they're 26?  Oh, Jesus.  Come on.  You got a three-finger graduation ring.  You don't?  You know what I'm saying?  We usually don't even graduate.  Most of us just leave. 
[03:28:00]  You know exactly.  I left.  I left.  Chuck, who do you want to play in this game, the white boys or the black guys?  Guys and girls.  I'm sorry?  Who do you want to play this game?  I want everyone to play the game.  If you play Monopoly, you can play Life as a Black Man because you don't have to have any  understanding.  Yeah, and white people don't have to really go through it.  It's just a game, right?  It's just a game.  And that's the beautiful thing about it, right?  You can just stop playing.  I don't want to play no more.  But we can't stop, huh?  That's the whole point.  What demo are you going for?  I mean, do you want these games in the Starbucks or the bodegas? 
[03:28:30]  I'd like to see it everywhere.  Put them in the Starbucks, brother.  I'd like to see it everywhere.  That's where the money at.  I'd like to see it everywhere because really, the game is truly all about...  That's like somebody saying, well, where would you rather sell cocaine at, in the hood  or on Wall Street?  They buy them all on Wall Street.  Look, you get an opportunity for crime.  So whenever you land on the crime spot, you have the choice to pull that crime card.  So that's actually you doing a lick right then.  Would you rather have them steal the game or buy the game? 
[03:29:00]  You can steal it.  Just leave 30 bucks behind.  I'm looking at some of the cards here.  The ghetto card.  You fall and break your arm on a wet floor in a restaurant and file suit.  Collect $5,000.  That's a nice come up right there.  That sounds nice.  It's a nice come up.  All you want is $5,000.  You should have put more than that down there.  I dated a chick with a trigonometry, man.  You are followed by police.  She got that lawsuit.  Pull police card.  I haven't seen the police cards yet.  Oh, yeah.  Pull the police card.  That's you dealing with the police, but bad police. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, bad things happen when you deal with the police?  More times than not.  18-year-old black male.  Pull a police card.  See what it says on the back.  Let me grab a couple of police cards here.  All right.  Rodney King right there.  You are taken in for questioning.  Missed three turns if you have $10,000 or more.  So I guess if you have the money, they're going to bring you in and ask you where you got your money from.  There you go.  It's an inconvenience.  An officer pulls his gun on you.  Mistaken identity.  Move back one's face.  Oh, wait. 
[03:30:00]  Being black is an inconvenience?  No, no.  The police is an inconvenience.  Oh, okay.  Dealing with the black man.  You know some black people think being black is an inconvenience.  Oh, no.  I can't even say what I was about to say, but nah.  Uh-uh.  What were you going to say?  I was going to say, hell nah.  Nah, nah.  Well, I'm proud of being black.  And I'm just demonstrating how ignorant racism is and how it's a setback and a detriment to all minorities.  And truly, the game is life is any man, any minority.  However, I call it life is a black man because I find that in our society that we're black men carry such a negative connotation. 
[03:30:30]  Say that again?  Where's the hit the trucker in the head with the toilet and then dance card?  I think that would be under the crime category.  Well, what are some of the other police cars?  I'm looking at it.  Yeah, you're cited for public drunkenness.  You're questioned in conjunction with recent gang shootings.  Son, you got to have the stuff in there about the ignorant blacks, too, man.  Well, that's what I'm assuming this is. 
[03:31:00]  You get caught with an illegal cell phone.  You're caught with an unregistered handgun.  Yeah, because you know, you know, our people stink, too.  Oh, no doubt.  No doubt.  So we show the consequences for negative actions.  Right.  And how is the setback?  Oh, yeah.  It looks like the white guy is supposed to look bad in this game.  No, not at all.  Have you gotten any flags in this show?  Because the game clearly doesn't deal with color.  So the discrimination you may face might not be a white person doing it to you, but it's just a person. 
[03:31:30]  Anthony's going through all the police cars.  There's not many positive police cars you can pull.  No, no.  I can't really personally think of too many positive instances being an 18-year-old black man of me encountering with the police where it's going to be good.  Have you gotten a lot of crap for putting this game out from people or no?  Literally, when people play the game and they're...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Where is he?  It was supposed to...  Hello?  Chuck?  Ah, damn it.  Get him back on the phone.  We'll get him back on.  The conference...  And I lost the other guy now.  And he had a good one.  Yo, are you still there?  Oh, man. 
[03:32:00]  I screwed up everything.  There's a whole prison section here in the game?  Someone asked if there was a Kill Whitey card.  Yeah.  It was right there.  That's the guy from the Daily News today.  He's back, man.  Hey, Will, what's up?  What's up?  I was going to do the Kill Whitey card.  He's lucky you win all the whole game.  I know.  We lost the duty.  He pushed the lotion on.  He pushed the lotion on.  He pushed the lotion on.  He's Genevieve.  I might picture her on the website.  All right.  Thank you, Will.  Thank you.  We're getting Chuck back on.  What did he say?  He was doing white guy lines, I think. 
[03:32:30]  Put the lotion in the basket.  I love that line.  Oh, my goodness.  Push the lotion in the basket.  I'm trying to get Chuck Sawyer back on.  I hung up on him by accident.  This game is crazy.  There's prison.  Like an hour just to read the directions, man.  Yeah.  There's a whole different part of the game.  Like, there's the board.  That's not a fun game.  And then there's another part of the game that if you go to prison, you've got to use this board.  I've got to live this life, man.  And I'm not trying to play no game about it, man.  All right, Chuck.  There's enough to live.  I'm back.  Sorry about that.  Being black, don't you feel that? 
[03:33:00]  It's enough.  Being black, don't you feel that it's enough just to have to live it?  Well, I think that I want everyone to understand the struggle that we truly go through.  Hold on.  Let me say something.  You said a game, right?  Yeah.  Now, I'm with you.  I support you on this and everything.  But I just want to know.  You know, I think that might be a buzzkill at a party.  Hey, let's play a game.  And you feel like the black man struggle game.  And you think they might become depressed and just leave the party?  Absolutely not, Tracy. 
[03:33:30]  Because when you think about it, you're a comedian.  No, no, no.  Not all the time.  Not all the time.  I'm not always a comedian.  No, no, no.  But I want you to understand what I'm about to say.  But hold on.  It'll give some white people and some black people some insight on the struggle of the  black man.  That's true.  That's true.  In a game form.  In a game format.  Right.  But what I'm saying is that the funniest comedians literally get up there and tell the truth.  And the truth is reality.  It's the funniest thing.  And literally, the game is all about reality.  Absolutely.  So, you know, if you're comfortable and you're conscious within yourself and what you're 
[03:34:00]  going through and you're positive in your struggle, then you'll appreciate the game  and you'll appreciate how far you've made it through.  Hey, but you know, I know the game too, baby.  You know, I got white people that say sarcastic stuff to me every day.  You didn't hear what the homeboy just said on the phone about the put a little nigga  into it?  No doubt.  Hey, and that's the color right there.  Once you mature enough, you'll be like, well, you know what I'm saying?  It's not personal.  You know what I'm saying?  I can't take it like that because, you know, then I'll be walking around like I'm on a  rag or something. 
[03:34:30]  Exactly.  And I don't want to live my life angry at nobody like that.  Exactly.  So, you know what?  When you play the game and you pull that racism card and it says you get in a fight with a  co-worker for using the N-word, then it gives you a little bit better understanding.  So when that co-worker says that, you take the power back from him and understand his  ignorance and you ain't even got a bang on it.  Because I used to have issues with females, but then I look around, all the women helped  me out in my life.  So I got to give them props, all the ladies.  Right, right.  You and my ex-girl with the trigonometry, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:35:00]  Right, right.  Because she helped me out when she got that money, you know?  Hey, Ant's looking at more of the cards.  Oh, I'm looking at the prison cards now.  Yeah, prison's tough now.  Prison's tough.  You are forced to toss an inmate's salad.  Move back four spaces.  Oh, my goodness.  That's an inconvenience.  That's more than an inconvenience.  You think?  You get attacked and killed by a rival gang?  Game over?  Now, that's more than an inconvenience.  You're done.  So everyone else is still rolling but you.  If you're getting raped in the jail, do you have to move back in space, then move forward 
[03:35:30]  in space, then move back in space?  Well, no.  When you're getting raped, you're just missing turns.  It's all about them.  Chuck, being a white guy, if I were to play this game, I would just laugh a lot.  I don't think I'm going to learn too much.  Yeah, it's a game.  So it's meant to be fun.  I want you to laugh.  It seems like the people that would play the game are converting.  But male rape ain't fun, man.  I'm not going to sit there and think I'm learning anything from this game.  I'm going to laugh a lot.  But it's a game, though.  I mean, truly, that's the whole purpose.  I want you to laugh.  It's a game.  I want you to have fun. 
[03:36:00]  But inadvertently, you're also going to learn a couple of things when you play.  But that is so true, though, Chuck, because life is a game.  And if you don't laugh, you're going to cry.  There you go.  Look at how you've got to play, though, with tokens.  And you know, this is something that I tell everyone with this game.  That's a little racist right there.  Pick a token and move them around the board.  And there's a white token.  Look at you, Chuck.  Oh, my goodness.  Being a comedian.  Chuck, if a black guy and a white guy both roll a six, does the white guy move four and the black guy move eight?  Well, now, if the black guy has an SUV, he does. 
[03:36:30]  Because once you get downtown, you've got to have a car to get around because you're downtown.  So if you don't have money to buy a car, you get a bus pass.  How long did it take you to create this game?  I spend about 100 hours a week for about 18 months.  100 hours a week.  And how old are you?  33.  Yeah, you're the same age as me.  We're from the same school.  Exactly.  So you know the game now, huh?  We try and accomplish the same thing.  You know the game now?  Where do you live, Chuck?  I'm in L.A., Redondo Beach.  Is that a good neighborhood? 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A real good neighborhood.  All right.  What else can you tell us about the game before we let you go?  Well, I just want to say, really, that...  How much it costs, man?  I'm sorry?  How much does it cost?  30 bucks.  Oh, that's the whole game right there.  30 bucks, huh?  Hey, that's the game.  But I want to let everyone know that they can find a game at our website, www.blackmangame.com,  or they can call us toll-free to find out more information about the game at 877-2526.  Uh-oh. 
[03:37:30]  Hey, Chuck.  Yeah?  You got the call waiting.  Yeah, hey, hey, hey.  You know, I'm a busy guy.  I'm a busy guy.  Well, your phone number...  They're clicking in during your phone number.  Yeah, your phone number didn't get out because somebody's trying to call you.  Oh, you missed me.  Okay, all right.  Here we go again.  877-252-2426.  All right.  Blackmangame.com.  Thank you, Chuck.  Thank you so much, guys, for having me.  Peace, Trace.  Peace out, baby.  Good luck.  Chuck?  Yeah, I'm here.  Oh, you got him, Jim. 
[03:38:00]  That's an awful thing.  And this is about AIDS.  30 bucks.  Clip.  Wow.  Come on, man.  I ain't spending no $30.  I want a video game for 30 bucks.  I want a video game version.  Could you give the J-Lo theory before we take a break, Tracy?  You did curse.  It's all right.  They got it down the line.  Yeah, don't worry about that.  J-Lo.  I don't think Puffy ever broke up.  Now, that's a pretty bold statement right there. 
[03:38:30]  I mean, but that's my personal statement.  I just think that how do you leave Puffy?  Who's eating at the top of the food chain to marry a dancer?  Who's making 40 grand a year?  A dancer.  A dancer.  I saw the behind the music with Puffy.  He's out every night drinking the Chrissy.  That's Puffy joint right there, man.  Yeah, yeah.  That's his joint.  And both of them making songs about each other and getting paid at the same time.  So you're thinking it just makes more drama and keeps involved?  Yeah, you had to take all the attention off of this and put it on that. 
[03:39:00]  She had a career, too.  And he dig her.  That's what I dig about Puff.  Puff cared about her career.  Move away from that for a minute.  And then let her go.  Move away from that for a minute.  Yeah.  I'll come back and get you in a little while.  That makes sense, you know?  You know?  But that's brilliant people having geniuses around you.  But he don't want her.  All the spin thing thing.  He don't want her going on.  Like Michael Jackson.  Let's take the attention off the little boy thing and put it in.  Let me marry Elvis' daughter.  That's a pretty good distraction.  Kiss on MTV to add the drama and the spice and all of that. 
[03:39:30]  I don't see that happening.  Never.  Imagine Mike stinking up the room, man.  Mike don't have no hot, sweaty, stink sex.  No.  I don't see that happening, man.  He don't bust off on the cheeks and all of that.  He never blinded nobody.  You can see where I'm coming from.  I'm gross. 
[03:40:00]  He's so sexist.  He's a sexist.  He's a feminist.  They're dumping it all like crazy, but we're enjoying it.  Damn it.  Why don't we take a break and then we're going to end the show.  I don't know if Tracy's sticking around.  If he is, that's cool.  I got to breeze out.  I got to go get dinner.  All right.  We having rice-a-roni.  We didn't even get to talk about Brian Fellows.  I had the rice-a-roni.  That's a great character.  I'm coming back.  That is a great character. 
[03:40:30]  I got people that's here on the 10th floor.  Named Opie Andy.  I could come back.  Andy.  Anthony.  One or the other.  Do you get crap in the hood for doing the Brian Fellows character?  No.  Do your boys make fun of you pretty good?  No.  Well, my cipher is tight.  I don't have a bun.  I don't have a whole entourage and all of that.  I'm pretty much dolo.  I stand on my own two feet.  And I do what I want to do.  If it's funny to me and creative, I do it. 
[03:41:00]  You know what I'm saying?  I love Brian Fellows because he's a fun character.  So I don't care what anybody's saying.  It's a great character.  That's right.  When the parrot kept saying, I'm Brian Fellow.  I'm Brian Fellow.  He's crazy.  I'm Brian Fellow.  That parrot is crazy.  I'm Brian Fellows.  I'm Brian Fellows.  You know, to make people crack up.  You know, it don't matter.  I don't like your dog.  I've transcended.  Cool.  Well, Tracy's going to come back and hang with us, Anthony.  Tracy Morgan from Saturday Night Live. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  He's going to be on Comedy Central August 26th.  Doing his own thing.  And then he's going to host the comic group.  Tracy Morgan.  One mic.  Tracy Morgan, Comedy Central August 26th.  And then you come back two days later to host Comic Group for Comedy Central on August 28th.  All right.  It's Tracy Morgan.  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with this repetitive.  Mindless.  Don't be crotch-grabbing.  Anthony.  Mindless.  Don't be crotch-grabbing.

You don't think?  It's not strep.  But I gotta go, you know.  All right.  Well, Anthony, we never got to talk to Lady Di today.  To tell her if she stays or goes.  So we'll have to do that tomorrow.  To watch.  No ladies came to New York to get in on the WOW Contest.  Very, very disappointed.  Thank you, ladies.  We have one girl officially representing New York in the WOW Contest. 
[03:48:30]  The WOW Contest, ladies, you got a few more weeks to qualify.  You just go down to the radio station that we broadcast on, and they'll take your picture,  and they'll send the pictures in.  We'll put them up on OpieandAnthony.com.  Our listeners get to go to OpieandAnthony.com, check out the contestants.  Eventually they will vote.  And one lady will walk away with $5,000 cash provided by RisqueVideo.com.  R-I-S-Q-U-E Video.com.  Your 24-hour adult video, novelty, and DVD superstore.  That's RisqueVideo.com. 
[03:49:00]  That's a nice chunk of paper.  So far, though, man, the representation is just plain awful.  Yeah.  Meaning we just don't have a lot of contestants.  We have what?  I think 10 contestants, 12 contestants maybe.  Awful.  Maybe they don't understand $5,000.  This is a really big deal.  We got some of the gentlemen's magazines looking at this contest.  They might do a little piece on it.  Here's your shot.  Also, you know, you get some fame and fortune, too, man.  Right.  Next time we're out and about, we parade you around, you'll be like a rock star, man. 
[03:49:30]  There you go.  So, qualify.  Tomorrow.  Why don't you do it tomorrow?  Go down to the radio station and get your pictures done.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  I'm just cranky all day.  Nothing to do with my own thing.  Nothing to do with anybody.  You're cranky.  He's sick.  He's got his personal...  I want to bite somebody's neck.  All right.  I think he's always in it.  I love it.  We're going to patiently wait, Anthony, for Knuckle Sandwich to figure out what we could  do with one of the guys' girlfriend. 
[03:50:00]  Yes.  She's very hot.  She's very hot.  The band wants this CD right here.  Play it on the radio.  Next time you hear that sound.  It's a big deal.  It's right before you hear it go.  It's a big deal, though.  Exposure in 25 cities.  The band sent pictures of one of their girlfriends.  She's really hot.  She looks like Alicia Silverstone.  She's in all sorts of lingerie.  And they're going to try to figure out what this girl will do in this studio to get this. 
[03:50:30]  Play it on the radio.  Play it on the radio.  See?  Some bands are pretty clever.  You got your songs.  You want to play it on a show that's out there in a lot of cities around the country.  There you go.  You come up with a little idea.  You got our attention.  Now we'll see if they come up with a good idea.  That's the type of girls musicians get.  It's hot girls like that.  That's not comic box.  That's musician box.  You think?  I know for a fact.  You make it up in quantity.  What they lack in quality, though. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, in sheer weight volume.  You know, if we're judging by mass.  Tonnage.  All right.  Let's go back to the phones.  Frank, what did you learn on the show today?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Well, today I learned that Tracy's working hard to break down those racial stereotypes.  He's a 33-year-old black man with a 16-year-old son.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  All right, guys.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned that strippers in New York attend Brooklyn County Community College.  Yeah.  And there'll never be a white man game because we're all too busy working. 
[03:51:30]  There you go.  Jeez.  Mike, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  I do.  It puts the pictures on the website.  It's you again.  What a dick.  You're killing us today, bro.  Thanks, Mike.  Rich, what did you learn on the show today?  Rich.  Hello.  Hey, guys.  How we doing?  Pretty good.  Oh, I learned today that I went to law school for three years to become a trigonometrist.  Very good.  Thank you, Rich. 
[03:52:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Isaac.  Isaac, what did you learn on the show today?  Oh, no.  Today I learned that Tracy Morgan is the mayor of Kicksville.  Kicksville.  Yes.  That's going back a little bit.  Also, Opie, I learned that your fantasy woman is Grace Jones.  Oh, that's small.  All right.  Norton, quit being Chris Cranky and come on out of it.  All right, guys.  I'm out.  Chris Cranky.  That was a good one.  He had a few things there to get off his chest.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned Cheddar went out with the Sugar Hell Gang. 
[03:52:30]  Jersey Gary is good for a bunch every day.  I learned Opie's angle wasn't good yesterday.  He also learned they played a golf game in Long Island and a rock concert broke out.  He also learned you got to smack the booty and ride the wave.  He also learned never, ever overlook the prosthetic money machine.  And he finally learned that H-T-T-P stands for Hey Tim, tight pants.  Thanks, Norton.  Fleacher Anthony.  Today I learned that black girl won't eat the dirty penny, but he stares at male junk pictures on the elevator shaft. 
[03:53:00]  I had a really clean one off.  I don't know if it made sense.  Eric from Brooklyn.  Today I learned that Dave Winfield gave Robin Givens' moms the clap.  And Sean from Philly.  I learned tossing a fellow prison inmate salad is an inconvenience.  Inconvenience.  Once again.  The understatement of the century.  Once again, we want to say hi to Seattle.  Yes, Seattle.  And the buzz for having the balls to get us back on the Seattle airwaves.  So thank you.  Thank you very much.  Very cool.  We had a short run with a tiny little AM station. 
[03:53:30]  They blew us off for Classic Country, which was a very big embarrassment to our careers.  Classic Country.  And the buzz has helped us out, and they put us on a real huge FM station in Seattle.  So thank you very much.  All right?  Right.  With that, I guess we'll do it all again tomorrow.  I'll rest.  I'll rest my throat.  Okay.  A mess.  Feels like he gargled with glass, Opie.  We did all right, Tom.  We did all right.  All right, Ben.  We're out of here.  Oh, it's 6.49 today.  I thought I had another minute. 
[03:54:00]  No.  Why are we early?  He wants to do it early, but now it's too late.  Now you're right on time.  What kind of scumbag would actually go over and make the next show late?  Right.  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, there's going to be problems with that.  Friends of the Opie and Anthony Show stay at the Park Central New York here in Midtown Manhattan.  Call 1-800-346-1359.

Sure, she knows how you feel, but just saying I love you just doesn't seem enough,  and you really want to get it right.  You want poetry, the perfect words, the way you've heard it in songs and movies.  But guys, let's face it, not all of us are poets.  And that's why engagement rings were invented.

We're so patient, answered all of our questions.  I'm just so pleased with the service.  I told them, I wish I had had that kind of service when I went to go buy my wedding dress. 
[03:56:30]  They were so unhelpful.  When I went to go buy my wedding dress at one of those, you know, swanky boutiques.  And these people were just so kind and patient and helpful.  And you have a customer of their life.  Don't worry, Vicki.  The one thing we're not is swanky.  You're going to like the way you look.  I guarantee it.
