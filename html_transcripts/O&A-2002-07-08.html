<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie detailing his intense anxiety about flying, contrasting his own discomfort with the calm demeanor of others on planes. This led to a discussion of airport security, particularly racial profiling following an LAX shooting. Opie recounted observing increased scrutiny of darker-skinned and Middle Eastern-appearing individuals at Long Beach Airport. Anthony, calling in, debated the ethics of such profiling, arguing its justification in a “war” context.  Several callers, including an airline mechanic and a pilot, offered their perspectives on air travel safety and piloting, often contradicting Opie's anxieties. The segment also touched upon absurd airport passenger behavior, like oversized carry-ons.  Opie then described a comedic appearance on "More Sports," where he played a WNBA stalker, detailing the makeup and physical comedy.  The conversation circled back to the show's "WOW" contest and the quality of contestants' tattoos.  The hosts concluded this segment by providing their phone numbers and thanking callers.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Opie's Hollywood segment, including humorous anecdotes about his agent and a fictional encounter with George C. Scott.  Jay Moore was a guest in the studio to discuss the segment, which also involved comedian Ralphie May who reportedly fell asleep in the office afterward.  The hosts then gleefully celebrated the firing of their former program director, Dave Dickless, using highly offensive language to express their resentment and recounting past grievances. They predicted the firing of Dickless’ replacement, Rocco, and excitedly discussed it with several callers.  Listener-submitted photos for the "Wow" segment were shown, prompting explicit commentary on the women depicted.  The cryogenic freezing of Ted Williams’ head was discussed with sarcastic humor, followed by jokes about body parts of deceased sports figures as potential memorabilia.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on a bizarre auction of cloned body parts and memorabilia from deceased and living sports figures.  Don West participated in this segment alongside Opie and Anthony.  Items up for auction included, but were not limited to: Ted Williams' cloned head, Lyle Alzado's brain pieces, John Crook's "cancer nut," Will Chamberlain's "schlong," Vernon Maxwell's daughter (with a suggestion to clone her), Payne Stewart's toes, Jim Abbott's hand, Lance Armstrong's testicle, Thurman Munson's lung and altimeter, Dale Earnhardt's remains, Tiger Woods' fingers, the ball that killed Tony Kimeliaro, Brian Piccolo's backfield, Cory Stringer's doll, parts of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team, Bob Murphy's memory, Donnie Moore's brain matter, George Brett's hemorrhoids, Joe Torre's prostate, Dr. J's child's manifold, Walter Payton's liver, Mike Utley's spine, Len Bias' nostrils, Roberto Clemente's parachute, Argentinian soccer team beef patties, Martina Navratilova's penis, Sonny Bono's skis, Dennis Bird's shoes, Rich Voss's "funny bump," the Kyle family's "shattered hopes and dreams," Bill Buckner's luck, Dave Dickwitz's testicles, Scott Norwood's shoe, Jim Kelly's "Killer Instinct," Darryl Strawberry's colon, Owen Hart's bungee cord, Joe Seisman's thigh bone, Ted Williams' (non-existent) World Series ring, Charles Lindbergh's blood alcohol level, and Duck Koo Kim's fighting trunks. The segment also revisited the firing of Dave Dickless, featured "Wow" contest photos, discussed a photo of President George W. Bush’s supposedly staged fishing trip, and included a call about the cryogenically frozen Ted Williams.  Numerous callers participated, making absurd bids and jokes.  The hosts repeatedly mentioned their upcoming OzFest appearance.

A later segment featured a call from Manny and his girlfriend, where Manny insisted his girlfriend was a "ten" despite her short stature and weight around 110-120 pounds.  The hosts reacted with amusement and skepticism.  Manny and his girlfriend expressed a desire to participate in a segment called "Sex for Sam." The hosts then discussed their own experiences; one host alluded to a past event involving nudity, bodily functions, and significant expense, promising details the following day. Another host, Jim, stated he enjoyed the show passively.  The broadcast ended with the hosts agreeing to begin the next show with a discussion of the aforementioned anecdote.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  How are you?  It stinks and I don't like it.  I'm the party pooper.  Marijuana is a narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show!  Hi!  We are live!  Yeah, one of the few, I guess.  What day is it? I don't even know.  It's July 7th.  8th?  8th?  Stop it.  Are we up to July 8th?  I have to change my watch.  30 days has September, or April, June, and November. 
[00:00:30]  Your watch isn't set?  I have the 7th, Opie.  Look at that Casio.  It's a swatch.  I thought you made $100 million.  It's a swatch.  That's a $100 million watch there.  No, this is the $50 million watch.  Remember.  Oh, yeah.  The $100 million watch had to go elsewhere.  Wow, we got lots to talk about today.  Oh, my God.  Opie was off in Hollywood.  Hollywood.  Hollywood.  Yeah, I can start with that. 
[00:01:00]  I just got back from L.A., and I just flew in, and boy, am I...  Oh, never mind.  Can I start with this?  Could someone explain flying to me, please?  That's a problem.  You always have an issue flying to your vacation locations.  You've known me for a long time.  I don't really get anxiety attacks and stuff, right?  Right.  I mean, I have all the problems.  We all know that.  But for the most part, the anxiety thing, eh, whatever. 
[00:01:30]  You know, flying brings out these anxiety attacks.  I think it's that you are thousands of feet in the air and have no...  They're literally perched on a seat.  Yeah, but everyone else is fine with it.  No.  You look around the plane, they're doing a four- or five-hour sleep thing.  They probably look at you.  We had a five-hour flight.  I saw people sleep the whole time.  Yeah, but they probably...  Not worrying the world.  They look at you and go, God, how does he do to just watch a movie?  You know, how does he sit there and watch the DVD player? 
[00:02:00]  You're the sleeping guy?  He's on drugs.  He's so freaked out.  The sleeping people aren't the most relaxed.  They are the most neurotic.  They take the drugs and they pass out.  Where does one get these drugs before they fly?  Prescription medication from your local doctor.  I need one of those doctors.  You need one of those doctors?  I need an Elvis doctor.  You know something?  People get that, though, just for flying.  Like, my mother's insane with flying.  She doesn't like to fly.  So she goes to the doctor.  They prescribe her Valium or whatever the hell else she's got to take. 
[00:02:30]  And she passes out.  And I'm thinking, that's bad.  There are certain airline mishaps that require you to be sharp.  Oh, stop.  To stay alive.  Name one.  They're few and far between.  Oh, boy, that little seatbelt's going to help us all.  How about that 767, 757 that went down in the water in the Caribbean somewhere?  Right.  And off of that vacation island.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, you know, people had to swim.  Could you imagine that?  Oh, he would have made it.  But, you know, he's on the Valium. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, but most crashes are, you know, pretty nasty.  Yeah.  I don't have to tell you.  And I would probably be better just like, you know, you're just snoring away.  I'm not afraid of the terrorist thing.  I think they got that kind of figured out as far as in the air.  Yeah.  I mean, the airport thing is a whole different situation.  Does the thousands of moving parts that your life depend on?  Is that what it is?  The virtually thousands of moving parts?  It's a nightmare, dude. 
[00:03:30]  It's a nightmare.  I get these insane anxiety attacks.  And you know what?  I see the stewardesses and stuff, and they're just sitting there.  They're sitting there, and we got some turbulence and stuff.  And they're just reading their book, laughing and joking, making fun of all the passengers.  They put down those little flip-down seats, fasten their little safety belts so you can look right at them, because they're right there.  They're sitting on a half seat, not a worry in the world.  And I walk to the bathroom, and I'm thinking, now why aren't they worried?  And I was thinking to myself, I know why, because they were told something. 
[00:04:00]  And someone has to tell me that so I can fly better.  Oh, my God.  What were they told, something good or bad?  Probably, you know, how rare it is that these stupid things fall out of the sky.  It is very rare.  Yeah, but I need to understand more, because I hear the engines working.  Thank God.  I was right over the wing, so you get to hear all sorts of fun noises.  There's a lot of machinery in those.  I heard the cargo beneath, you know, shifting and adjusting, and I'm thinking, bomb.  You heard a little thud?  I'm looking out the window going, oh, God. 
[00:04:30]  How can that engine keep running?  Yeah, and we're in the middle of the desert.  How many times has that turbine spun already?  Right.  I mean, in a weird way, if, you know, you're flying over a civilization, you feel a little safer.  But when you're flying over the desert, that might even be better.  What if he's got to set her down?  I don't know.  I'm thinking maybe he could, you know, something could happen in the desert there.  I don't know. 
[00:05:00]  But someone has to explain this flying thing, because I've had it.  I have had it.  Well, it's just a matter of simple aerodynamics, Opie.  How about this one?  You take off, right?  Yeah, we all know they have to go full throttle.  Full throttle to get that.  Yeah, you kind of, yeah, push it right there, the firewall.  Get that dead weight in the middle of the air.  Right.  For the next five and a half hours.  Sure.  Oh, God.  And then all of a sudden, they do that bank turn, because now they've got to go in their direction, right?  Uh-huh.  But what do they do? 
[00:05:30]  They let up on the throttle and slow it out.  Yeah, you pull her back a little.  At this point, I'm looking out the window going, oh, my God, we're falling to the earth.  You're done with your climb, now.  I am convinced we are falling to the earth.  I'm like, you can't slow down yet.  We're only a mile off the ground.  When you take off and you're climbing, you need that full power.  Yeah, but also...  Then when you turn and you're entering your departure pattern, you have to level off at a certain altitude that the air traffic control gives you.  So you back off a little bit. 
[00:06:00]  Meaning you have to slow the plane down.  Yeah.  To me, that makes no sense when you're in the air.  You should never slow down if you're in the air.  Always go full.  Right.  No, it doesn't work.  How do you slow down in the air?  There are things like other planes, other traffic in the area that you don't want to catch up to.  There are plenty of reasons you have to slow down.  It's about slowing down in the air.  It seems like gravity would somehow take over.  As long as you're over a certain speed, you're fine. 
[00:06:30]  Plenty of...  My heart was in my throat when that happened.  And then we get just a normal thing.  And now you've been flying for five and a half hours.  I didn't even close my eyes.  I was too scared.  And then we're getting close to JFK and they really slowed the plane down.  That's called landing.  Yeah, but you don't...  Eventually...  But now it's pitch dark.  It stops.  I know.  But now it's pitch dark and you don't know where you are in the flight pattern for them  to be slowing down so much.  He knows.  He up front knows.  He's got all his instruments. 
[00:07:00]  He's looking.  Everything's taken care of.  You just sit in the back and watch your videos and relax.  Look out the window.  Whatever it takes, don't worry.  They got it all figured out.  As long as nothing goes wrong, I'm just glad I'm back on Earth.  When things...  But they told the pilots and the stewards or something.  They showed them the odds and stuff, how ridiculous it is.  Yeah.  Because there's not a worry in the world for these people.  How many flights leave this planet every day?  How many flights leave every day? 
[00:07:30]  Tell me, because that'll help me.  There are a million.  A million flights.  A million.  How many people...  How many planes are in the air right now, you think?  I don't know.  But every day, planes...  Right now.  Right now.  Here it is.  Wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish.  Here's them all taking off from this planet.  From all the airports in the world.  Wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish, wish.  And today might be one of those days nothing happens.  This might be a week.  Nothing happens.  A month.  We've gone a year, two years without a major commercial mishap. 
[00:08:00]  And then occasionally one's got to go.  It's just the odds.  The odds are pretty good.  But it can't be the JetBlue that I was on, right?  The very good airline.  There you go.  That's a great name for an airline.  JetBlue.  He needed the money.  Oh!  No, it's, you know, you just got to take it for what it is.  It's another thing, like you say.  Now, Mr. Rollerblading and sketching on the backs of trucks in Manhattan. 
[00:08:30]  That's a lot safer for me.  No, it is not.  The second you strap those goddamn blades on, you're in more danger than getting on a goddamn plane.  But I'm in control of my own destiny.  Do you get it now?  You still are.  You got on the plane.  I'm not in control of anything.  Yes, you are.  What if this day the pilot decides he hates his life?  Well, then you got a problem.  What can I tell you?  But you're in control of your destiny that you chose to go on that vacation. 
[00:09:00]  I would much rather jump on my inlines and sketch around Manhattan, yes.  Hold on to the backs of trucks, which I do from time to time.  Pull a John Travolta.  He went and got his own 747, his commercial airline pilot rating.  The guy can now fly a 747.  Problem there?  Yeah.  I don't think he keeps up on the maintenance.  He's got people.  I don't think people that own planes in general keep up on the maintenance.  You wouldn't fly with John Travolta?  Hell no.  Well, this plane is greased lightning.  You wouldn't fly with him? 
[00:09:30]  Hey, check that.  Check my landing gear.  We flew into Long Beach?  Yeah, because we had a last-minute flight.  We couldn't get anything to LAX, thank God.  Oh, God, I can only imagine if Opie flew into that airport.  Thank God.  I have a feeling.  I have a theory on this whole terrorist thing.  It was a terrorist act.  I mean, when are they going to admit it?  At LAX, the two people that got shot?  I have a feeling that Osama bin Laden called in a strike, and everyone else chickened out  at the last second. 
[00:10:00]  And he was the guy left holding the bag?  You know when you're a kid, and you might be jumping from a cliff into water or something?  On three, everyone goes.  On three, it's, you know, 20, 30 feet in the air, and no, dudes, we're going to do it  on three.  All of us.  One, two, three, and you're the only idiot, and everyone else chickened out at the last  second?  Yeah.  I'm thinking that everyone else chickened out, and this guy was the only one that went.  All right, here we go.  Thank God for all of us.  One, two, three, everybody!  Hey, where is everybody?  Right, why am I the only one?  I thought we called in a strike. 
[00:10:30]  But coming back last night?  Yeah.  At the Long Beach airport, and I am so happy they're doing this.  Every person that had dark skin, they were pulling over for the extra check.  Jesus.  What do you mean by dark skin?  Well, actually...  African Americans?  No, no, no.  The blacks aren't the problem.  We have...  This time around.  We do have audio of the terrorist right before he pulled his gun out.  I think you're right.  Let's do it!  Oh, no, he was the only one that did. 
[00:11:00]  I was kind of chuckling, because at Long Beach airport, everyone that looked a little Middle  Eastern and a little darker was getting that extra check just before they, you know, walk  onto the tarmac.  Are they really doing that?  I saw it like you wouldn't believe.  Because this was the problem I had over this holiday weekend.  Fourth of July, everyone's waiting for the big terrorist event.  Well, can I tell you something?  I think in America, I think in this country, we've got a little PC with who we're going  to check and stuff, but after what happened at LAX, Long Beach is, what, 30, 35 minutes 
[00:11:30]  away?  They're like, screw the PC crap.  We know what happened two days ago.  We are checking everyone that's a little darker in Middle Eastern.  Oh, yeah, dude.  They were lined up.  Well, it's not a, you know something?  I was laughing.  I'm like, that guy's a Mexican.  That guy is a Middle Eastern.  I don't see it happening enough.  When I turn on the news and I see that there was a shooting at LAX, it was the El Al, the  Israeli airline counter, and this guy pulls a gun out, shoots a couple of people, and he's 
[00:12:00]  then shot by the wonderful security of El Al.  Well, these guys mean business, these Israelis.  They know the deal.  You don't want that dork ticket counter guy responsible for your life if someone starts  shooting.  Those guys, when they pull the weapons out, the guy, they just blast them right there.  They don't F around.  They don't try to shoot him in the leg.  No.  Take his goddamn head off.  Done.  And they did.  And I'm watching going, all right, what's the guy's name?  Hours are going by.  What's the guy's name? 
[00:12:30]  Finally, the name comes out, and it's the Mohammed, one of these names.  And you know the names I'm talking about.  And I start saying, why aren't they checking these people?  And they say, do you know how much security, how much money it would take if we now push  this perimeter they talk about back to the street where people then have to enter the  actual airport building?  Don't you think it's silly that they don't put everyone through a metal detector before  they get into the airport?  You're in the airport now. 
[00:13:00]  You shouldn't have guns.  Why only take care of the people that are going to fly?  There are other people that are at risk.  Right.  But for some reason, they say it would take too much money.  And then the guy says this.  He's on the news.  He goes, do you know what it would be like to check everybody coming into the airport?  No.  You don't have to check everybody.  Just the Middle Eastern Arab men.  That's all.  That's all you got to check.  That's all that's doing this.  When are people going to get this?  Those are the only people doing this. 
[00:13:30]  So just check them.  But we're not.  We're too PC, like you said.  But I'm glad to hear they were doing that at Long Beach.  I know.  Something tells me in Long Beach this has been going on for years.  I had a kid.  Check the dark people.  We had the DVD carry-on, so they had to check that, you know, after you go through the x-ray  machine there.  And the kid had to be 22.  Really?  I didn't feel safe.  I'm like, and he didn't even look where I would have hidden explosives.  I want the ex-Navy SEAL. 
[00:14:00]  Guy goes, wow, that's a nice DVD.  I'm like, yeah, why don't you, like, open it and make sure, you know, I would have felt  safer.  Yeah.  He's like, wow, five, how many hours do you get before the battery goes?  I'm like, will you shut up and, you know, do your job so I feel a little safer before  I go on my anxiety flight here?  What time does it blow?  What did you just say?  Right.  No.  Oh, I'm talking about your DVD flight.  Oh, right.  They had a check-in.  I felt good about that.  But then I'm thinking, he's not checking it good enough.  Right.  I never think they're checking it good enough either. 
[00:14:30]  And then we had a whole, a whole flyer.  We're getting to the ticket counter before we go out on the tarmac.  And the carry-on thing is getting out of hand.  Rick.  He's one of those idiots.  Really?  Well, this guy, this guy, you know, is ready to hand his ticket before he walks out the  door.  He literally has a duffel bag.  Huge.  And the lady, really nice, goes, look, you know, we're going to have to check that.  Got to check it.  And even explain, look, we can do it right over there. 
[00:15:00]  Quick tag.  No big deal.  The guy starts yelling and screaming.  They told me at the other ticket counter that this was okay.  No one told them it was okay.  This thing was huge.  You know, everyone has to make sacrifices.  If they say you can't bring that huge duffel bag on the plane, then deal with it.  I've seen these guys on the plane all the time.  They got the overhead thing open.  They're shoving their huge carry-on.  You ever see the guy that brings the hard shell suitcase?  The one that comes out on the carousel because you're supposed to check it.  He brings it in, and you're just hearing this, and he's slamming the door down. 
[00:15:30]  It's not quite going.  And everyone's looking at him like he's a dick.  And he goes, hey, it fit.  Yeah, it fit.  In one whole carry-on bin.  You then make it so three more people cannot put their carry-on in that is the size that  you're supposed to have.  These selfish, I'm the only person on this planet type of person.  You want to throw them out the plane.  Oh, they're out there.  Come, come, come.  You're going to break something. 
[00:16:00]  They're out there.  There are lights in there.  You could short out a goddamn light socket.  Oh, my God.  And my little free TV went out for a little while.  Chepaloo has the free TVs for everybody.  See, that's one thing I don't like about airlines that give you your personal TV.  I'll take my goddamn DVD player on there.  But it's just more goddamn wires running through the body of that thing.  I don't think it.  More goddamn wires that rub.  They're rubbing all the time against each other, against a screw that a maintenance guy  might not have put enough silicone on. 
[00:16:30]  And all of a sudden, it goes, and I'm with you.  Because that didn't help my anxiety.  I'm thinking, wait, no.  If my free TV is going out just like that, what else could just go out?  Just kind of go in the middle of the air, right?  I want a right flyer.  That's what I want to take my flights on.  Simple.  There's no electronics on it at all.  I knew this call was coming in, so get ready for the fireworks.  Let's go to Anthony, who wants to take on Anthony.  Anthony. 
[00:17:00]  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Now, listen, there's no more.  You can't get any more American than me, man.  I could just say that.  Stop every Middle Eastern person.  Stop everyone that looks dark.  Because they're the ones doing this one.  Why not?  Why not?  Come on, man.  Why not?  All right.  I can understand you're going to get, like, the shinobis with the...  You're not telling me what the problem is with this whole solution.  Stop every dark person?  Stop everyone that looks to be of Middle Eastern descent. 
[00:17:30]  That's it.  What's wrong with that problem?  And every German's a Nazi?  No, you idiot.  But back in World War II, you sure as crap checked them.  You sure as crap locked up the Japs that were in this country.  It's called a war that is going on.  It's called these people, and we know who they are, are killing us.  So check them.  There's no reason to check out Aunt Martha, the white woman that's 55, 60 years old.  No reason.  It costs money, and it takes time. 
[00:18:00]  You check the people that are killing us.  Period.  It's called racial profiling.  Right.  You know what?  Sometimes it works.  It works when you're in a war, you idiot.  What about some Puerto Ricans?  Some Puerto Ricans look dark, too.  They look like Arabs.  You know something?  If they look like they're of Abdescent...  I've never seen a Puerto Rican look like an Arab.  You can check up the Brooklyn.  You'll see what I'm talking about.  I've seen Italians that look like Arabs.  Look at me.  I'm Sicilian.  I would be...  You'd think I'd get pulled over, and I'd be told, hey, give me your ID.  Yeah.  I'd go, okay, here's my ID.  I wouldn't care. 
[00:18:30]  But not many Arabs wear in the goatee these days.  Well, you know, what if I shave it?  I would still...  I would have no problem getting pulled aside every time and giving my ID, telling who  I am, then going through my crap.  You say that because you're as white as white gets.  No, I'm not.  Anthony, I'm Italian.  You've never seen Anthony?  He kind of looks Arab-ish.  That's close to black being Italian.  My brother.  And back when it wasn't cool for Arabs to drive vans, Anthony drove a van. 
[00:19:00]  I drove a van, too.  That's not good.  Anthony would drive a van around Babylon while we were doing the BAB thing down the straight  path and stuff, and people looked at him like he was a terrorist.  Like a Apollo air conditioning van.  I don't know what he's going to blow up in the straight path area.  He would do a world of improvements.  I know.  I cost millions of dollars in improvement.  But, yeah, he wasn't cool back in 93 to be Arab in a van.  All right, one more question.  How long is this going to go on for?  How long are you going to start pulling over dog people?  Until the war is over. 
[00:19:30]  Until the war is over.  Until they don't feel wanted anymore in this country.  How's that?  Or until other people start killing us.  You don't understand something.  Think of it this way.  Think of it this way.  If you walked out on the street and every few days on the news you heard that Doberman  Pinschers were biting people and killing them and attacking them, and nothing else but Doberman  Pinschers were biting and killing people. 
[00:20:00]  Why would you then round up the German Shepherds and the Kali's?  We know who is trying to kill us in this war.  We know it is men of Arab descent.  So why the hell are we wasting time and resources and maybe letting a few of them slip through  the cracks as we check a stroller full of white children when we know who's doing this?  Just because we have to be PC.  What's your problem? 
[00:20:30]  You're thinking politically correct as people die.  When I look at that way, you guys do have a point.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right.  You know what?  I'm going to go lock myself in my room and listen to you guys.  That's all good.  And I'll wait another 10 years until everything's done.  Anthony, let me tell you something.  You don't have to agree with us.  We're just throwing our crap out there, so don't worry about it.  But you know what?  We're in a war situation.  Tough ass.  Uh-huh.  Ted?  It's called war.  Look into it.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Bo?  Hey.  I just wanted to explain something real quick.  I don't want to bore everybody, but when you're taking off, they have to go max power. 
[00:21:00]  But once they get up in the air, they're not allowed to exceed 250 knots.  Okay.  So that's why they cut back on power.  Below 10,000, they have to stay below 250.  Once they get above 10,000, then they can start climbing again and using their full power again.  I just don't understand this slowing down in midair thing.  Maybe I should have paid more attention in science when I was growing up.  It just does.  There's something that doesn't make sense there.  Well, they're just following rules and regulations.  I guess they can get in trouble if they don't.  And your body moves forward? 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  So now my body technically is moving faster than a plane for that split second.  You're just feeling the effects of...  That's not a good feeling.  Some well-known physics?  That's all.  A little inertia?  Yeah.  You guys are talking about the whole profiling thing.  Check out page six of the Post today.  They got an article in there about how the Pennsylvania police may have some Afghani guy near a nuclear power plant.  We just heard this.  We were watching the news earlier.  Yeah.  So check that out.  That's a perfect example.  They got to do it.  There's no other way, man.  They have to do that. 
[00:22:00]  Thank you, Mark.  Okay, guys.  Bye.  Later.  People don't seem to understand that.  I think it's time to make people feel unwelcome in this country.  A little bit.  A little bit.  It's not 1850.  Yeah.  Not the big, the melting pot.  No.  Let's bring everybody in.  It's time to make people feel unwelcome.  I like watching those old black and white films and the photographs of the people on the old wooden decks as they pass by the Statue of Liberty.  Right?  That's nice.  And they're crying. 
[00:22:30]  They're damn happy to be here.  A new life.  That's when they should have cut it off.  The advent of color film ruined everything.  I just like the black and white shots.  Here comes Mamma Mia, the big fat Italian mama.  She's bringing over the family, huh?  And then you got the guy at Ellis Island that is a jokester and decides to change your name on you.  Hey, he's just going to change your name.  And now you're going to just wreck your family tree forever and make him go around with a silly name. 
[00:23:00]  It doesn't matter your name was Andolini.  Right.  Now it's Corleone because you're from there.  Our agent, he was telling me a story this past weekend.  I guess when his great-grandfather or whatever came to America, he had a pretty cool Jewish name, I guess.  Okay?  The guy at Ellis Island decided to give him the name Eat Man.  Eat Man.  Now why did he pick Eat Man?  Is that a little joke?  Because the guy had a sense of humor, obviously.  Hey, Eat Man.  So now Eat Man's whole family has to deal with a horrible name. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  It wasn't his name that his ancestors had.  It was a name some schmuck at Ellis Island decided to give him at the last second.  He's lucky.  The guy behind him was Suck Me.  He named him Suck Me.  They were a bunch of jokesters.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Eat Man.  Robert, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You can check how many flights there are here in the United States alone by checking flightview.com. 
[00:24:00]  There's an average of 3,000 flights up in the air here.  The continental United States.  So during the day, there's an average of over 3,000 flights in the air at any given time?  Yes, sir.  Wow.  Hey, that makes me feel a little better.  Yeah, I know.  Imagine that on September 11.  I checked that out.  The middle is empty.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks, Robert.  Later.  The other thing, Ant, when you're looking out the window.  Oh, my God.  Look at current U.S. air traffic.  That's all the plans.  See, they're going to look.  There's dots all over that map. 
[00:24:30]  They're going to be crashing into each other.  No, there's things for that.  There's collision avoidance.  Well, what if that little thingy shorts out like my stupid little TV, Anthony?  Well, then there's a problem.  Look at all the little dots.  How about this one?  You're flying, and you're looking out the window, and all of a sudden you're convinced  that there's a plane coming right at you from the distance, and you're thinking,  hey, you would never see it before it hits this plane.  You wouldn't.  Oh, God.  You just got to sit there and wonder if something's just going to rip right through the flight 
[00:25:00]  cabin.  See, you know, if I fly for an hour, I don't get into this crap, thank God, because by the  time you figure out your seat and figure out you're sitting next to an a-hole, and you're  trying to get a glass of water or a drink and trying to push your carry-on under the  seat in front of you, flight's pretty much over.  But when you go from L.A. to New York, and you got five to six hours, oh, you could  think about it all.  Oh, your mind is a very powerful thing.  Yeah.  I don't like it at all.  Yeah, don't worry about it. 
[00:25:30]  You're fine.  Let me go to Mike.  Mike, what's up, Mike?  Yo, Opie, I'm totally with you, man.  Time to make these people feel a little more happy to be in America, you know what I'm saying?  Well, I like to make them feel a little unwelcome.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I'm talking about, you know?  Make these Arabs feel like, hey, there's no way I'm going to get away with anything because  they got their eye on all of us.  But you know what it is?  They look at us in this country and say, wow, these people are so afraid of offending 
[00:26:00]  us that we could get away with literally murder.  And we can walk all over them.  And they do.  And they also are bombs through some 22-year-olds at the freaking airport.  It's ridiculous, man.  And they also know how to play into our whole PC mentality here in America.  They're not stupid.  They absolutely do.  They have to be laughing like, oh, my God, we kill thousands of their people, and they're  afraid that we may be offended.  What a coup. 
[00:26:30]  What a coup this is.  It's like lions out on the plains of the Serengeti with a bunch of gazelle that are just walking  up to them.  Well, we don't want to take the wide way around the lions.  It might offend the lions.  They might feel that we don't like them.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Let's go to Sid real fast.  Sid?  Yes.  Hey, what's up, Sid?  How are you guys doing?  Airline mechanic, yes.  Uh-oh.  You're the mechanic.  I always think about you guys.  I'm always thinking, who is the last guy that turned a wrench on this bird? 
[00:27:00]  You would be surprised.  No, no.  No, no.  We don't want to be surprised.  No.  We don't want to be surprised.  You guys are so underpaid, it's not even funny.  Yes.  You should get a raise every six months.  I wish you'd make a call directly to the CEO about that.  You don't feel you're being paid enough?  Well, nobody ever feels like they're being paid enough for that.  I was thinking about that, too, Anthony.  I think, you know, you take a little wrench and you loosen it one or two notches.  Oh, God. 
[00:27:30]  No, no, no, no.  No one will ever know.  No, no, no, no.  We're way more professional than that.  Despite the fact that the pay may not be what we want, we're way more professional than that.  You never forgot anything inside one of the panels and closed it up?  No, I can't say that I ever have.  Come on.  Even professional surgeons forget a sponge every once in a while.  A sponge, a suture and a sponge.  You ever walk away from a plane and it's already, like, taking off and you start thinking,  wait, I think I might have left a wrench in the middle of the circuit board.  Where's that wrench?  I know I had a wrench. 
[00:28:00]  In the middle of the circuit board.  Well, whatever.  I don't know how an effing plane works, obviously.  No, no.  What do you work on?  The whole plane?  Yeah, I'm an A&P mechanic.  We generally work on whatever, you know, the whole fleet that the airline that I work for has.  Everything from, you know, from the front of the airplane to the F of the airplane.  Really?  The whole, yeah, the whole ball of wax.  I mean, there's nothing that we don't mess with.  It's engines, flight controls, toilets, you know. 
[00:28:30]  What's...  Sid, simple question.  What are the odds that a plane goes down?  They're very slim, old.  There's so many backup systems on an aircraft that...  Ah, the backup systems.  I heard you saying before, well, talking about the blips on the screen,  what if this guy's, you know, screen just seems to go out like my TV?  Yeah.  Everything.  Can you hear the anxiety?  It made me laugh like hell, because that's, I guess, how the general public is.  You know, the general public isn't aware of all the backup systems that are involved in the aviation industry. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  There's nothing that's left to chance.  There's no one, one particular, just one system for any, you know, one control for any system.  There's so many backups that really...  Yeah.  Just sit back and watch your movies and relax.  So many systems.  Close the window shade, you know.  Don't make yourself nuts.  All right, man.  All right?  Well, thank you, Sid.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Just like all those, um... 
[00:29:30]  Just like all those backup systems were ripped apart when that engine blew apart on the tail end of that plane that landed in that cornfield,  and every system and backup system and hydraulic system just went,  and the pilot had to steer the plane with the two remaining engines on the wings  until it cartwheeled down the runway in flames.  They had enough time to get a film crew to the airport to film it.  Jesus.  So you know the people inside knew what was going on.  Hey, Jay, what's up? 
[00:30:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to put Opie at ease.  My friend, he's a pilot for American Airlines,  and after the 11th, I asked him what he thought about arming pilots.  And he said, firstly, he doesn't trust some of his co-pilots with a plane unless a gun.  Oh, there you go.  Opie, fly this week.  I'll see you later.  Bye-bye.  All right.  They're fine.  Our fleet of planes is fine.  Nothing to worry about here.  Hey, Scott, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I just... 
[00:30:30]  You said you had some questions about airline stuff.  Yeah.  I'm an airline pilot.  What do you want to know?  There's a man on the wing.  What do you do?  He's throwing panels into the engine.  Is it true you guys do absolutely nothing in the cockpit?  Oh, absolutely not.  It's not true at all.  There's lots of stuff from...  I hear you guys, like, do crossword puzzles, read books.  No, not really.  Tip back a few.  Occasionally, cruise flight, it gets pretty slow, but we don't do anything.  See, people are under this...  Monitor systems and stuff like that.  Are you flying right now?  No, I'm not flying right now. 
[00:31:00]  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  You're good.  Well, what are the odds of a plane going down?  The odds of a plane going down?  Yeah.  Oh, hundreds of thousands to one.  You're more likely to get struck by lightning in any given day than you are to go down in a plane.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  See?  All right, thank you.  You bet.  Bye.  People are under this misconception, Opie, that the pilots don't do anything.  Like, it's all automatic.  All right, run rate 211 is clear for takeoff. 
[00:31:30]  Here's a plane getting ready to takeoff.  Where is this guy?  Option 780, turn right at a 2-8-0-5-8-0-1-2-0.  See?  2-8-0-1-2-0, option 780.  Yeah, see the pilot.  Option 780.  He's happy.  That's a pilot.  Look how smooth he is.  This is live from where?  I don't know.  O'Hare?  Chicago.  Is it?  4-2.  See, they got everything under control, Opie.  Team 44, good day, sir.  Good day.  See?  See, good day.  Happy.  Usually that's the last thing they hear on the flight recorder.  Oh, God, no. 
[00:32:00]  Good day.  Have a good day.  4-2-5-0-1-5.  These are just a bunch of planes taking off right now.  5-8-8-6-7-7-0.  Hi, this is Mrs. JFK Jr.  I'd like to place a telephone call, collect for my cell phone.  Hi.  What?  Johnny, why are the gauges all spinning around?  I'm trying to make a phone call.  Could you turn the radio down?  Jesus. 
[00:32:30]  Spoiled brat.  Hi.  Yeah, hi.  We're going to be late for the wedding.  Yeah, we're going to be a little late for the wedding.  We're flying.  We got off a little late.  Johnny with the cast.  It was hard for him to get on the plane.  Then we had to get the dog on.  But hey, they want to go.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  2-7-0-7 on a west heading up.  Johnny, shut that up.  I'm trying to make a phone call.  Why are there sparks coming out of your stick? 
[00:33:00]  8-2-7-0-7 on a west heading up.  Hey.  See?  American Airlines is landing.  25 Seth.  Good day.  A lot of good days.  They're happening.  See?  Everything's running smoothly.  Behind the scenes, Opie.  Everything's taken care of.  Your job, just sit and relax.  By the way, you should tell people that's the latest on the JFK Jr. crash.  Yeah.  That she was on a cell phone.  Caroline's fatal cell phone call.  Signals may have interfered with the plane's instruments as John fought bravely to make a landing. 
[00:33:30]  This bitch couldn't keep her goddamn cell phone off.  Who is she?  Ben?  Making calls all the time?  Ben, don't take a phone if we fly.  Turn it off.  I know you.  You make 50 phone calls.  Hi.  I'm looking up at the sky.  This is wonderful.  It's so blue, the sky.  Oh, wait.  That's water.  John, John, why is the water above us? 
[00:34:00]  Why is the water above us?  Why is that the thing that says ALT on it?  Why is that spinning backwards so quickly?  Hmm.  Let me, okay.  Let me make another phone call.  JFK audio?  Cool.  Hey, Pete.  Yeah, man.  What's going on, bro?  A couple tips for you guys.  All right.  For you, Opie.  All right.  You got to get this OAG book.  It's basically got, it's a little book that's got every flight in the world in it. 
[00:34:30]  And basically what you do is turn turbulence, flip through that thing, and realize that you're  one of the million flights in the world that day.  It helps you.  That day.  That day.  Right.  Another guy is saying at any time there are at least 60,000 people above air in the USA.  Exactly.  But here's the other thing that I think about when I'm, and I fly over 100,000 miles a year.  How many people do you know that have died in car crashes?  Everyone knows someone that's died in a car crash.  You know anybody that's ever died in a plane crash?  Buddy Holly. 
[00:35:00]  Well, do you know anybody that's died in a plane crash?  JFK Jr.  JFK Jr.  Well, if I'm, hey, listen, you know what I'm saying.  I know absolutely what you're saying.  That's the other thing.  And turbulence.  When you're on a flight path and you hit turbulence, it's about a hundred of the flights that  just went through that exact same turbulence that you're going through.  Right.  Oh, that'll help me right there.  And they tell the guys behind them, they say, hey.  It's going to be a little.  You know, he got a little bumpy.  So beforehand they go, all right.  So they know.  Buckle up.  So that's right.  Oh, they see it coming.  Nice.  You're not the first one to hit that turbulence.  There are other flights ahead of you. 
[00:35:30]  And they got the Doppler radar in the nose, Opie.  The Doppler.  They know what the wind's doing up front.  They know all the turbulence that's coming.  All right.  But you know something, Pete?  Yep.  The people that were on TWA flight that went down, going to Flight 300, was it?  They thought the same thing.  Hey, listen.  Odds are in your favor.  And the other thing is, don't call them stewardesses either, by the way.  Sexy stews.  Yeah, baby.  Bring on the sexy stews. 
[00:36:00]  No, they're flight attendants.  I think they're called flight attendants these days.  Yes.  They're stewardesses.  And the guy flight attendants are all gay, by the way.  Every last one of them.  That is the funny thing.  Do you like something to drink?  They are a flying fruit.  They are waitresses in the sky.  Flight attendants.  Basically.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  I just wanted to help you guys out.  Help out.  And by the way, I'm one of those dicks that puts a big, heavy supper bag overhead. 
[00:36:30]  But I'll tell you one thing about it, though.  I've never had an airline lose my bag.  Right.  Well, when you have it with you.  Because it's always with me.  Exactly.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  There you go.  You feeling better now, O?  You feeling a little better?  Trust me.  I know I'm a pussy.  A lot of people saying, quit being a pussy.  I know I'm a pussy.  Yes.  Yes.  Tell you what.  I don't feel like flying today.  Look at all the dots.  And see the airplanes on that, Matt?  Yeah.  Those are the planes that are just going to Philly. 
[00:37:00]  Hello, here.  Red Rock 72.  Welcome, Bob.  All those planes are just going to Philly.  The actual planes that you see on the screen.  The dots are the planes that are going everywhere.  But the planes, those are going to Philly.  There's got to be 50 flights just going to Philly.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Right now, that's like current.  Right.  That's right now.  See?  All right.  All right.  We've got lots to do today.  Got to talk about L.A. a little bit.  We've got to talk about the 4th of July.  I guess you had a good time with Frenchie and the gang. 
[00:37:30]  You've got special privileges to watch the fireworks.  Billy Mack.  And I watched one of the best fireworks displays I've ever seen on any 4th of July.  Right there off of Manhattan.  Okay.  We'll get into a lot of things today.  What else?  Oh, Taylor's here from Philly.  She's getting her pictures done for the WOW Contest.  Ah.  She is really, really hot.  Can't wait to see her pictures.  This is a tough one for Boston, but we've got to go with it.  Ted Williams.  The family is insane. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, Ted Williams.  I know there's a lot of sad people in Boston today.  I understand.  Who is it?  The son?  John Henry.  Yeah, John Henry, the son, is the one that's really insane.  This guy's been nuts for a long time.  I mean, there's a lot of stories that have come out about this guy where, you know,  where Ted Williams, all he wants to do is relax in his retirement stuff.  He's in his 80s, and his son is just piling up hundreds of bats for him to sign.  Pimping him out.  So he can make more money off his father's name.  Yeah.  Well, he's taking it to the next level, and if you haven't heard, you better stick around. 
[00:38:30]  It's sick.  Also, Michael Jackson in the news.  Wacko Jacko, as the Post loves to call him.  Anytime I see a Wacko Jacko headline in the Post, I'm buying it.  Wacko Jacko.  Uh, and lots of things, actually.  Yeah.  I almost thought he was the next Elvis.  Yeah.  We're going to have fun today.  Let me lick that off.  Coming soon to the opening show, Sex for Sam 3, 3, 3, 3. 
[00:39:00]  What?  What the hell was that?  What?  That was the first time I heard that one.  What?  I think the fine people at Hotwire.  The site to go to to save money on airfare and hotels.  I don't know how much they'd appreciate you reading through their commercial with a crawl full of food.  It's my new delivery.  I think it's going to be hot. 
[00:39:30]  The eating food thing?  You think all the other stations will start picking up on it?  Do you know what puppets a lot of PDs are and whatnot?  Hey, that works.  I'm pretty proud of that read, Anthony.  I'll pop that out.  It's better than my Clint Eastwood or my hotel-y read.  The hotel-y read.  You are freaking people out with the hotel-y read.  But that's my new version.  I like it.  I'm proud of that one.  The eating read.  All right.  The eating read.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We haven't even given out the phone numbers yet. 
[00:40:00]  People get pissed off when we don't give out the phone numbers.  I know.  For an interactive radio show, you need the phone numbers.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Wow.  Our buddy Jay Moore is on the line, Anthony.  Yes.  Let's see how this went out in Hollywood.  Jay Moore.  Hello, Anthony.  How are you?  Very well. 
[00:40:30]  And yourself?  Oh, fantastic.  Beautiful day in Southern California, gentlemen.  I want to move there.  Yeah.  Opie was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed when he got off the plane, brother.  Let me tell you.  I just want to know.  We have our entertainment report here.  What happened on the set of more sports?  I know Opie was part of one of the skits, one of your opening segments.  Yeah, Opie.  No, not an opening segment.  This has evolved now.  Oh, this is like a piece now?  It's not just a quick opener?  Yeah.  I think I could say that I was part of kind of like an SNL skit. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, this will be in place of a remote one day.  We do, you know, like the Tyson Goes Wild videotapes.  Right.  This would be our sports century tribute or our tribute to Mr. WNBA Stalker, like a fake beer commercial.  Right.  Now, Jay told me that he was taking care of his pals.  He likes to take care of his pals.  You know the ridicule I'm going to get when this finally airs?  I can't wait. 
[00:41:30]  I thought I was flying out to L.A. and Jay was going to take care of his pal and make me look like Brad Pitt or something.  Uh-oh.  But instead, he made me look like Urkel.  Yeah, you did look like an Opie-esque Urkel.  But you know what?  It's something I was going to shoot myself.  And when I saw Opie dressed as the WNBA Stalker, nothing could ever be funnier than that.  Him wearing like a jacket from Rain Man.  My hair all greased.  It was all greasy.  We gave him cold, cold glasses.  He had a box of tissues under his arm the whole time.  Box of Kleenex at the Handy in case he makes a map of Hawaii in his pants. 
[00:42:00]  It was so funny.  I went to the set.  Anthony, I went to a set.  The set?  Okay.  Of more sports?  Yeah.  I had to get past that security guard that I've tried to do many, many times in my career.  And they whisked me right in, right to makeup.  Whisked in.  See that?  No BS.  He's my friend.  Let him in, dummy.  And Jay, man, you got a good thing going on over there.  He's got a great staff, a lot of hardworking people.  And it was so funny, the girl that wrote the skit, WNBA Stalker, I could tell when I met her, she's like, oh, great. 
[00:42:30]  Jay wants to put one of his friends in the cute little TV show and they're going to wreck my bit.  Oh, my.  That was Courtney Cronin.  And you know what?  She's from Boston.  I got to say hi to Courtney because she has family in Boston.  I sensed a little of that also.  However, she did not know the magnitude of having you in that skit like I knew that magnitude.  I was glad by the end of it she was very happy.  Yeah, she was not.  But at first you could just tell, oh, look at this. 
[00:43:00]  We're doing a favor.  But Anthony, I got to use my bit.  I got to tell you something, Anthony.  Yes?  We're all sitting around on the set and Morty, Bob Morton, of course.  Of course.  It's coming up to Opie's agent going, he's good.  Does he act a lot?  Oh.  Because it was very subtle.  He was Mr. WNBA Stalker, but very easily that could turn into like some goofy best damn sports show period sketch where like they're dunking basketball while eating donuts in slow motion.  I'm sure Adrian was working a deal.  Rumor has it it's going to be a recurring role on more sports. 
[00:43:30]  That's no rumor, my friend.  A recurring role.  Because the next step now is we've got to get you at an autograph signing with actual WNBA players.  Yeah.  And get them to like leave the table like, oh my God, it's him.  Jay, I got to tell you something.  I'm sitting in makeup, right?  Getting ready for this thing.  Oh, lucky you.  No, no, no.  Oh, man, that girl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, okay.  There's lots to talk about.  There it is.  When you say sitting in makeup, I know.  You got to play.  Nice new crutch read.  Makeup artist has. 
[00:44:00]  That's a new crutch read, Anthony.  The makeup artist has 36 double D's and a tiny little tank top has no problem tending over to make sure the makeup's just right.  Did they put the tissue in your collar?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  I was rocking.  She's the kind of chick that, you know, has the best possible tattoos if you're a chick with a big rack.  Yeah, she's...  Like, they don't look trailer trashy at all.  They're just like the chick that knows how to party, knows exactly where to put her ink.  Yeah.  Unlike contestant 71 in the WOW Contest.  Oh, my God. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  I thought it was a bad birthmark.  Speaking of the WOW Contest...  It's Larry Bird, naked.  Looks like Drew Brees' face.  Anyway, go ahead, Anthony.  Speaking of the WOW Contest, I swear, man, these girls have some of the worst tattoos I've ever seen.  There are a couple, Opie, that are very nice.  But most of them, the girls that have tattoos, they are horrible and they had to be drunk when they got these things.  One girl ruined her breasts with tattoos.  Ruined them. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, I think what happened with the tattoo thing at first...  Would you have a tattoo of a bra?  There wasn't a lot of people doing tattoos.  But now that it's such a hot thing, now every guy could do the tattoo thing and they're ruining it for everybody.  Because now all these girls, you know, they're going to be the rebel, they're going to get the tattoos, and they're horrible.  Let me tell you something, guys.  That WOW Contest is blowing up because I was down in Dallas doing an improv and I was doing local radio in Dallas.  And they had, like, a separate floor of the entire radio building just for the WOW photos. 
[00:45:30]  And I was on...  Pugs and Kelly, right?  Pugs and Kelly.  They love you guys, bro.  Right on.  They're cool.  I had a good time with them.  But they were like, hey, you know, the WOW photos are going on upstairs.  I had to, like, take a freight elevator up.  It was, like, on the third floor and there's chicks lined up naked.  It was nice to know that you guys are blowing up all the way in Texas.  Hey, Jay, when were you in Dallas?  June 1st?  A couple...  Yeah, I believe...  No, you ass. 
[00:46:00]  Look, this is what I do know about Opie's sketch.  I was going to shoot it myself.  It's so funny.  But Opie definitely made it funnier.  And this is really going to be a funny, funny piece.  And I don't care what guff you take, for lack of a better expression.  No one will ever change my opinion that this is awesome.  Our listeners are going to kill me.  Well, they can kill the way you look, but that's exactly the way you're supposed to look in that sketch.  I'm telling you.  Can I tell this a quick story so I'm in makeup, right? 
[00:46:30]  And all of a sudden, Bob walks in.  You know, Robert Morton.  Of course.  You didn't tell me he was producing that show.  Robert Morton.  Opie, the Robert Morton.  Robert Morton.  Robert Morton.  Look, I'm a...  Robert Morton came out of retirement to produce more sports.  I'm a huge Letterman fan, and he was the guy that used to produce Letterman, and he was always on the phone, right?  He just casually walks in.  I'm like, hey, good to see you again.  Oh, look at you.  Hobnobbing.  I was freaking.  You were hobnobbing.  A little bit, a little bit.  With the Hollywood elite. 
[00:47:00]  So, by the way, I got the hugest bruise on my bicep.  Tell Walter thank you.  You want to talk to him yourself?  Yeah, get Walter on the phone.  Wow, what the hell happened there?  He said I had some rage.  Let's go.  Hey, Coco.  He's in the office next to mine.  He got a bigger office than me somehow.  I think he talked brother talk to whoever's in charge of the offices.  Brother talk.  I don't want to give away the skit, but there was one point where I had to get beat up pretty good.  Yeah.  And I told Walt, just go for it.  This is Hollywood, after all. 
[00:47:30]  I don't want to fake this.  Right.  You beat the crap out of me.  Look at this bruise.  So, are you saying you do your own stunts?  Oh, definitely he does, because he really got taken down on the bleachers.  It was amazing.  Wow.  And we surrounded him with, like, lesbians in the sketch, and we had Sandy sit up in the back  and look like the hot chick at the WNBA game.  Yeah.  And Walt goes, man, he's got some of that Long Island rage.  Yeah.  Walt was giving you credit on your fighting skills, bro, because you were resisting arrest,  my friend.  Yes, I was.  At one point, it was so funny, Walter got, like, ghetto strong, and then, like, the natural, 
[00:48:00]  angry black man came out, and he just started screaming at Opie, come on, come on, come on,  come on, come on.  Yeah.  He wasn't happy that a white guy was, you know, neck and neck with him there.  But, yeah, he gave Opie the Long Island strong props.  Cool.  But I did tell him that he gave you the bruise, and a special thanks goes out to Walt.  But when do you guys go on vacation?  Because we've got to make sure we sync up so that we make sure it airs when you guys know  that it's going to air.  You've got to air it before we go on vacation so I can take the abuse live. 
[00:48:30]  Well, I'm telling you, man.  It would be a pussy move to make sure it airs when we're on vacation, because I'm telling  you that, you know, our listeners are going to just kill me the next day.  Jay, I don't know why you anticipate that if it's a funny sketch.  You're playing a WNBA stalker.  We're not going to dress a guy up like Brad Pitt.  Jay, Jay, I looked ridiculous.  They won't even notice that it was...  But they think the show is funny, I would assume.  You don't know the mentality of our listeners.  They're not going to notice that it was funny.  They're going to notice how ridiculous I look. 
[00:49:00]  Ridiculous.  Well, let's hope that...  All right, listeners, go crazy on Anthony.  Go crazy on Opie if you want, but he's supposed...  All right, you know what?  They're going to do what they're going to do.  What am I doing?  Jay, it's all right.  They're going to tell me to be quiet.  I missed the softball game.  It's all good.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  I'm like, Jay, this is how you take care of your friends.  No, man, we took care of you.  Oh, Anthony, we send a car service to whisk Opie from his...  Oh! 
[00:49:30]  ...Malibu location to our Hollywood studio.  He thumbs his nose at it and says, no, I'm going to have my agent drive me.  Oh, sorry.  Opie has his agent drive him.  Oh, wait, that's the wrong...  We need the Hollywood music.  When you talk agents and cars to pick you up.  No, but it's even weirder because it's Opie.  I'm talking about agents and Opie.  Like, Opie was out here in the flow, man.  Opie was, like, walking around with his agent, talking to Bob Morton.  It was pretty weird to look at. 
[00:50:00]  They're all caught up in that Hollywood scene.  It was pretty nuts.  I mean, we were taking pictures in the seats, like, on the set.  That was fun.  I've got to get my pictures developed and put them up on the website.  Yeah, Opie sat in the chair like he was being interviewed.  It was nice.  We lit up the stage for everybody.  Nice.  Hey, I've got pictures of me as the WNBA stalker.  I'll put it up on the website before the piece airs.  Yeah, a good cushion to blow a little.  Yeah, that's all that's about.  You're smart, Opie.  It's going to be a hilarious piece.  Opie, but let me tell you a little bit about Hollywood. 
[00:50:30]  Yep.  If things don't happen in five, six months, you're in front of George C. Scott in a seedy hotel room showing him your schlong.  My junk.  So what do you think?  It's not quite what we're looking for.  George C. Scott's casting porn?  Hardcore.  Hardcore.  Oh, that's right.  Turn it off.  I thought you meant literally right now.  He could be.  No, he's dead now.  I know.  It took me aback.  All right, Jay. 
[00:51:00]  All kidding aside, I want to thank you.  We had a lot of fun.  Hey, I had so much fun having you, and I've got to tell you, man, honestly, the whole staff, man, they're all from, you know, Boston, New York.  A lot of New York guys, and people will ride in Opie's step, Monty, let me tell you.  They were like, Opie, nice to meet you, man.  They were a little starstruck.  Absolutely, brother.  I'm telling you, we had NBA champions in here two weeks ago, and they're like, yeah, it's Rick Fox.  I see him on freaking Good Day L.A. every day.  Who cares?  That's cool. 
[00:51:30]  And then Opie rolls in, and they're like, yeah, Opie's here.  People are running around the offices.  Opie's here.  Opie's here.  And then I met your writer there, the big guy.  Ralphie May.  Ralphie.  Holy, yes.  We call him Jupiter.  He's a huge boy.  Yeah, he's not getting any smaller.  No.  He just picked up drinking.  Good for him.  And after we...  600 pounds, just discovered vodka lemonade.  That's a healthy move.  Yeah, the next John Fennett.  After we finished shooting, you finished the shoot. 
[00:52:00]  Ralphie May is back in the office, out cold, snoring with his mouth open, drooling, sleeping  in the middle of the office with 10, 12 guys around.  The guy could sleep anywhere.  Goddamn Hollywood.  The guy's so high, he could sleep anywhere.  Really?  If you did as much weed as that guy did, you'd be out like a light too, pal.  That guy smokes weed while he's smoking weed.  Nice.  Or whatever that means.  I was with you.  Where's Norton?  I don't know.  He decided not to show up today.  I hope he's still alive. 
[00:52:30]  What happened?  Big weekend for the kid?  I don't know.  That might have wrecked him and damn near killed him, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  Try the veal.  Have fun today.  And Opie, as soon as we get a rough cut together, we'll send it right over.  That'll be fun to check out.  Very Hollywood.  Can I hear some of the Hollywood music?  Yeah, sure.  It makes me laugh.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Hold on.  Hold on.  God, you're making me cue it up here for you and everything.  Jay Moore.  Don't you know Opie's a star now? 
[00:53:00]  He's not doing cards and working boards.  Come on, guys.  He had double Ds in his face while they applied makeup.  Come on, guys.  Jay Moore, thank you so much for joining us on this Hollywood segment of the Opie and Anthony program.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jay Moore.  Where's the music?  It's right here.  It's playing.  You just don't hear it.  Oh.  There it is.  I thought I was the one that requested it.  I'm the one not hearing it? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right, Jay.  Gentlemen, take care.  You suck.  There you go.  That's nice.  Suck it, you bitch.  Hey, you're going to Cleveland this weekend?  Yeah, bro.  Cleveland loves you guys, too.  That's right.  Last time I was in Cleveland, guys were in the audience yelling, okay, terrific.  Yeah.  You've got to get up there.  Someone's on the line saying he's going to check you out this weekend.  I'm telling you, more than any city in this country, you should go to Cleveland.  That town knows how to rally like no other. 
[00:54:00]  And I'm not saying that because I'm going there next weekend.  I would have told you that a month ago.  We're doing Buffalo this weekend, and then we've got to set up a Cleveland trip.  Buffalo's cool.  No disrespect to Buffalo, but, man, any town that sues the NFL and says, you can't take  the jerseys with you and wins, that's all you need to know about Cleveland.  Oh, you're going to move the team, huh?  Well, you know what?  The laundry stays, Your Honor.  Yeah.  Because we said so.  How cool is that?  That's the coolest move ever.  Yeah, you guys are blowing up in Cleveland.  Everything's working out for everybody. 
[00:54:30]  Anthony, when's your first catch?  Why don't you write it yourself, Anthony, because I don't want to hear it when I roll you  something like a WNBA stalker.  You roll out the red carpet for a guy, and now it's all, oh, I'm going to have to hear  it.  I was on television.  Nah, I'm pretty flexible.  I said all kidding aside, I'm really psyched.  We had a great time, bro, and that's going to come out real funny as soon as we find the  goofiest singer possible.  We salute you.  Oh, don't want to give away the gag, do we?  Yeah, I'll give away the gag.  All right, sorry.  You know, people get them online, those Bud Light commercials, like, Mr. All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet 
[00:55:00]  Inventor.  Gentlemen, take care of yourselves.  All right, Jay.  All right, bro, take care.  We'll talk to you soon.  There he goes, Jay Moore.  There he goes, Hollywood Jay Moore.  That was fun, though.  Rarely comes out here to New York anymore, now that he's got the TV show.  Doing the show until...  I know.  ...early September, I hear.  Oh, is that it, and then what?  Reruns, and then...  Well, then they've got to see if they're going to be picked up for another season.  Oh, they absolutely will pick that up.  Right?  I think he found a niche. 
[00:55:30]  I think so.  It's a funny show.  What, Ben?  Just go to break.  Why, you got something?  I got something huge.  Just go to break.  You got something huge that we could exploit?  Huge.  All right.  Huge.  Go to break.  Well, what...  I can't tell you.  Go to break.  Oh, okay.  But can we tell our listeners we're going to have something huge?  Something huge to you guys.  Huge.  All right.  Huge news.  Huge.  All right.  All right, we've got to go to break.  Huge news.  Next.  Are you ready?  Opie and Anthony are going to touch you where it's dirty. 
[00:56:00]  Take it like a champ, okay?  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-A-W.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  How you like us now. 
[00:56:30]  Mark, what's going on?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, bro.  Hey, I'm up here.  I'm down here, actually, in the D.C. area.  I was driving around on the Beltway just north of D.C.  And I didn't think these people actually did that wow thing.  I've heard you say it a lot of times, but I never believed it.  This piece of crap minivan pulled up next to me.  I thought they were going to ask for directions because so many people do.  We're driving, like, bumper to bumper.  I had my radio on, and I guess they could hear what I was listening to. 
[00:57:00]  This girl leans over and she asked me, what are you listening to?  And I told them.  I said, I don't need an answer.  They said, hey, is that that wow cell?  Hold on a second.  Let me give you something.  And she pulled up her shirt.  I was like, whoa.  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  Listen, can I say hi to her?  Honey, your minivan is a piece of crap, but your breasts make up for it.  You are hot.  There it is.  There you go.  Okay, guys, you're great.  Thanks a lot.  There you have it.  Wow really does work.  See how excited he sounded?  Who knew?  I thought it was just a goof.  That's what he said. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know.  And then all of a sudden it happens.  He had to tell someone.  Wow really does work.  That's how it works.  It's whip them out whenever, really.  So you just put the wow in your vehicle and wait.  That's all you got to do like that guy.  He didn't even think it worked.  And then all of a sudden he's got boobies in his face.  And if you want a wow sticker, if you want the New York version, I can tell you this much.  I don't know what the individual stations do to get those stickers out there.  But if you want a New York version of the wow sticker, send a self-addressed stamped envelope in.  We send it right out to you.  Yes.  The address is up on opianthony.com.  It's 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106. 
[00:58:00]  Okay?  Roy!  Well, Anthony, sad news today.  Sad news.  We're going with it.  Yeah.  Sounds legit to me.  There's a reason we say that Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Always win in the end.  Always win in the end.  This one took four years and three months to the day.  This one from the Boston chapter of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, what's wrong with our cards today?  Did you hit it?  That one ain't working?  Yeah, I hit it.  Oh, it's okay.  Taking a midway.  Oh.  Oh.  What a great god damn day.  It took a long time.  And I like to think we were the final straw. 
[00:59:00]  The catalyst.  The camel's back.  The catalyst.  Because this, I got a mother effer.  I got a really funny side note to this story that we're about to tell, too.  Mm-hmm.  That is just going to make someone explode.  Something I've been holding back a little info.  Well, just waiting for the right time, Anthony.  Right, right.  You want to explain what happened today?  Well, reports are coming in that Dave Dickless, our old program director, our old boss, when 
[00:59:30]  we were at WAAF in Worcester, they hate when you say that, I got the boot, they fired his  ass.  You're fine.  You're fine.  How does that feel? 
[01:00:00]  That's right.  Out.  Out and Z.  Fired.  One to go.  One to go.  Good.  You ass.  Dave Dickless, the spineless worm that was our boss when we were up there in Massachusetts. 
[01:00:30]  Gone.  He has been fired.  The one that did not stick up for us.  When we did the whole mayor is dead thing.  Pretty much sold us down the river.  That guy was it.  That guy was out of Massachusetts.  We've been waiting for this day for a very long time.  Oh, my God.  He was the guy that when we got fired didn't call nothing.  The one call that Opie got from him was, could you say that you stopped doing the bit a little 
[01:01:00]  early, like after I said something, like trying to just save his own ass.  And, well, you know something, more power to him, he did for a while and skated for a very long time.  But then Opie and Anthony came back into Boston on WBCN and the free ride was over.  You dick.  Over.  He was skating along, just skating along. 
[01:01:30]  Hopefully no one will notice.  Continuing with the station in the same light that we had pretty much started with that station.  Station was purely, you know, a suburb of Boston rock station playing the music.  And then when we got there, we we decided to tear it up a little bit.  We wanted to get our name out there and be recognized a little bit.  So we had some pretty outrageous ideas that he was up against us every goddamn time. 
[01:02:00]  Every time we came up with an idea that we said, this is going to be good.  This is something that's going to get our name out there.  It's not going to cost you anything.  There was always some problem with Dave Dickless.  Some group would call and complain.  The gays would call.  The goddamn PETA would call and he'd schedule meetings with these idiots.  The now organization, National Organization of Women called and said, stop.  Wow.  And what did the spineless wonder Dave Dickless do? 
[01:02:30]  He told us to stop.  Wow.  That's the brave leadership that we got out of this ass wipe.  And then when we got fired, he tried to continue by placing the fake Opie and Anthony in afternoons.  The slob and someone else and some sidekick.  And they skated and they skated. 
[01:03:00]  And then look who shows up back in the Boston radio.  Opie and Anthony on WBCN.  And a lot of the people that used to listen to us came back.  We got a lot of new listeners.  And all of a sudden you looked at the ratings and went, oh, no, what happened?  What happened?  And then management now.  It's all trickled down.  The upper management looks at the management below them and below them.  And then they look.  Why does this station blow all of a sudden?  Why aren't we getting ratings that we were getting? 
[01:03:30]  Hmm.  Hmm.  Where are the Opie and Anthony ratings?  Oh, well, we've started all new direction and we got a show that's just like them.  We didn't really need them.  They weren't that popular when they were here.  And finally, it took how long?  Oh, four years, three months.  Four to the day.  Years, three months.  And one day, actually.  And one day, I've been marking my bedpost for the last four years. 
[01:04:00]  And that's it.  One to go.  Guaranteed, Schlocko is gone within the next three months.  Here we go.  This is how it works in radio.  When a new PD comes into a radio station, ah, they don't really want to work with the old guys.  They want to bring in their guys.  Schlocko was brought in by Dave Dickless.  He brought him in to go on after us when we were up there.  And that was his boy. 
[01:04:30]  That's how it works in radio.  The program director, if they hire someone, you're his boy.  Because if you do well, he goes to management and goes, look at the hire I did.  Look at who I hired.  And look how well they're doing.  And when they fail, it's your responsibility.  And if you're not doing well, like Schlocko, and another program director comes in, he looks and goes, all right, let's take the situation here in New York. 
[01:05:00]  What happened to us?  We had a new PD come in after Gary left.  Remember that?  If we weren't doing well and the only thing that was doing well at this station, we know we would have been gone when they brought in Jeremy and Ken.  I wonder if they made Dave Dickless drive all the way to the colonnade in Boston to get fired.  Oh, would that have been great?  Hi, Dave.  Yeah, we'd like to see you at the colonnade. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, Dave, I got an idea.  Why don't you let the management at Intercom throw pies at your face?  Why don't you do that?  You'll get in the stocks.  You know, like that idea you brought up about the Opie and Anthony show, that we should let the mayor of Boston throw pies at our face.  That's a good one, Dave.  Back to Nebraska.  You want to know how sweet this revenge is?  Oh, I'm loving it.  Oh, by the way, we'll follow Dave Dickless' career.  And if we're on in that city, the nightmare doesn't end. 
[01:06:00]  The nightmare doesn't end.  Yes.  Yes.  You want to know how sweet this revenge is?  The same people, I want to say this carefully.  Yes.  Yes.  The same people that fired Dave Dickless were the ones, Anthony.  Yeah.  That hired us to be on the buzz in Seattle.  Say it again.  Say it again.  Say it again. 
[01:06:30]  The same.  Oh, God, I love this.  Oh, I love this.  The same people that were responsible for firing Dave Dickless at our old station AF were the same people that gave the okay to put us on the buzz in Seattle.  You dick!  Done. 
[01:07:00]  And we love those people.  Thank you for this fine opportunity to be on in Seattle.  Do you smell the reaper, Rocco?  Do you smell him?  He's creeping up behind you with the sickle.  One to go, Anthony.  One to go.  And we can finally rest and move on with our radio careers.  Then that station will mean absolutely nothing.  One to go.  Oh, how great is that? 
[01:07:30]  Yes.  Hello?  Guys, I think we're going into the gay zone on this one.  Why don't we schedule another meeting with the gays?  And they'll talk to you about sensitivity and how we have to be nice to people like the National Organization of Women.  Wow is offensive, guys.  And really, do you think you're going to get much mileage out of it?  I got a great idea.  Why don't we sit you up on a billboard and you won't come down until the Red Sox win or something like that. 
[01:08:00]  That's a great promotion.  Consider me the third member of the Opie and Anthony show.  Remember when you said that?  You jack off.  Do you remember when you said that?  Now you're the latest member of the Loser Club.  You're fired. 
[01:08:30]  Uh, Opie?  I don't really understand this Anthony thing.  He doesn't have any radio experience.  Why, Anthony?  Why?  Why indeed?  You can't see anything?  You jack off.  I think the Anthony thing is going to be a fad.  Yeah.  Why don't we, um, why don't we just pick a ticket number from Fenway and he could be your sidekick.  You don't need Anthony. 
[01:09:00]  You're fired.  Yes.  Take your 70s porno, gay porno mustache back to Nebraska and stick a big corncob up your balloon knot.  We don't want your A.  You're done.  You're labeled failure.  You failed without Opie and Anthony. 
[01:09:30]  Done.  You are one pathetic loser.  Right.  Bye-bye.  You are not the f*** out.  You do it.  Don't.  You.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go. 
[01:10:00]  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk-neck friend.  Look what I did to you again.  That's what happens to someone that doesn't support their people. 
[01:10:30]  There you go.  Bye-bye.  Ah!  Poof!  That's it.  Got to sell the house, Dave.  Sell that house.  Time to find a new school for the kids.  Yep.  Moving on again.  You had a great little run there, didn't you?  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  We came back from exile and destroyed you. 
[01:11:00]  You ass.  One to go.  One to go.  And believe me.  Believe me.  This will not take long.  Oh, God.  Please.  Please.  Please, God.  Yeah.  I hope our listeners in the Boston area are smart enough to go through the real estate section.  Oh.  Of the paper.  Oh.  I do believe there will be an open house in the very near future.  Oh, please, God.  Are they smart enough to figure it out? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine our listeners having to traipse through his house with a real estate agent?  Just knocking things over.  Please, God.  And, well, this is the family room.  Had a lot of great times here.  This is where Pookie, my wife, was running the radio station.  Here's the phone she used to call me on a daily basis to tell me what made good radio.  Dave?  Yes, schnookums? 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  It's your wife.  I don't like what I'm hearing on that Opie and Dopey show.  All right, sweetums.  I'll tame them down.  I'll give them a good talking to when I get to work tomorrow.  I had to listen to people talking about gay people.  I understand, schnookums.  Okay.  I'll have them suspended for the wow thing.  Dave leaving.  Dave leaving. 
[01:12:30]  There he goes.  Out the door.  Out the door.  What a great day.  Yes, Dave?  I don't know.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Bye-bye.  Someone go get champagne immediately.  Yes.  Yes.  Please get some champagne.  This is a big, big day for us. 
[01:13:00]  Here's Dave interviewing at his new job.  You like movies about gladiators.  Back to gay porno.  Here's intercom management with a call to Dave.  What it takes for nothing.  Wish somebody put this retard out of his misery.  Oh, they did.  Yes, they did.  Oh, they did.  Yes, they did.  Oh, they did.  We're going to be giddy for the rest of the show.  Oh.  Sorry. 
[01:13:30]  Because this is one of those moments when you exact revenge on somebody.  And you sit in New York City.  I mean, not to complain to our New York listeners, but you sit there waiting and waiting and waiting  to get back into the Boston market.  And you realize if one douche would have stood up for you, you'd probably still be there.  Yep.  Dave, what do I do, Dave?  I'm sorry, Ruckle.  I'm not your boss anymore. 
[01:14:00]  But, Dave, they're going to fire me.  It was a big surprise to Dave, Anthony.  Yeah?  Audio of Dave getting news of getting fired.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  He did sound a little confused there.  Bundy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Bundy.  Hey, I'm a long time listening from back when you took over for Liz Wilde.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And back when Dave used to harass you with AAF, you had a Da Da Dave song. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, Da Da Dave.  Yes.  One of my favorites.  Yes.  It shows what a tool he is and how much we would rag on him.  Can you play that one?  One of my favorites of all time.  He used to hotline all the time.  We'd be doing a bit, something on the air during the limited time that they would give us between songs to try to do something funny and be a little different and get the audience that we wound up getting up there.  No one hotlines us anymore. 
[01:15:00]  No.  No one.  We do not accept your hotlining.  We took the hotline number right out of the studio.  Guys, Dave, where are we going with this?  I don't know, Dave.  We're just kind of flowing, having fun with talking about, I don't know, the gay parade or something.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, this could get us in some trouble.  Really?  How is that, Dave?  Well, a lot of people are as sensitive, like my schnookies, my schnookums back home. 
[01:15:30]  My honey bunny just called me and she's upset that you're talking about gays and whatnot.  Take your C and put it in her face, Dave.  Shut her up with your C.  Bye-bye.  Well, here's a lovely bit from the ONA archives, Anthony.  When Dave actually hotlined us.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up? 
[01:16:00]  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads.  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really, but...  Pokey pokey in the butt. 
[01:16:30]  No, no.  Licky licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun.  But you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See you.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello.  We're going into the gay zone. 
[01:17:00]  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, you know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Uh-huh.  Gaze, gaze, gaze all.  You know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Uh-huh.  Licky licky.  Licky licky.  Lick, lick, lick.  The old dirt road.  What you doing?  Yeah.  Licky licky.  The old dirt road.  Licky licky.  What you doing?  Dirt road.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  That's fun.  Going into the gay zone.  Yeah.  Going into the gay zone  Going into the gay zone 
[01:17:30]  Want to uh, pokey pokey in the butt  Yeah, pokey pokey in the butt  Yeah, gay zone  Pokey pokey in the butt  Pokey pokey in the butt  Licky licky licky licky  Licky licky pokey pokey in the butt  Yeah, licky licky, yeah it's fun  Licky licky, yeah it's fun  Pokey pokey in the butt  Not really  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up? 
[01:18:00]  Hey, bro.  I just want to congratulate you on your accomplishment on Dave Dickler.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  What a great day.  I hope our listeners could let Rocco know for us that he is next.  Yes, please.  Please just let him know he is indeed next.  This is just the way it works.  I've been doing radio a very long time.  I know how this one's going to end.  We all know how this is going to end.  New guy comes in.  Lots of people leave.  Out with the old. 
[01:18:30]  Out with the old.  And especially if it isn't working anymore.  It just ain't working.  Sorry, but it ain't.  We came to town.  We're up against you, and it just didn't work.  They should have had a two-for-one firing today, though.  A two-for?  That would have been a great thing to do today.  Well, you know something?  They always get you after the shift.  They always get you after. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, you might want to call Rocco and say this could be the last show.  Could be the last show.  Because after the show is over, they always go,  Oh, you want to come into the office for a moment?  The new guy?  Look.  Look.  You're pizza.  I'm looking for a hamburger.  You know, pizza's good.  Pizza's good.  Pizza's good.  Sometimes you want a pizza.  But you know what?  I'm looking for a burger.  I'm looking for a burger.  And you're not a pizza.  Yeah, you're not a burger.  You're a pizza.  Go to a place that's looking for pizza, because I'm looking for burgers. 
[01:19:30]  Hey, I'm hungry.  This sounds great.  Where do we eat?  Oh, is this great.  Victory is sweet.  Victory.  After four years.  Three months, one day.  It's great when you've been exiled.  And then you return to the place that exiled you.  And then you conquer and vanquish. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, it's great.  So there you have it.  Huge news.  There it is.  Opie and Anthony show.  Bye-bye, Dave.  Another example of O&A always winning in the end.  Always win in the end.  Sometimes it takes a while.  It does.  Sometimes you've got to be patient and just sit back and wait.  You should look into buying Dave Dickless' house as a way to rub it in.  How satisfying would it be if you were the guys to buy the house he can no longer afford?  From Hedda in Jersey.  Wheelchair Fred. 
[01:20:30]  Yay.  Wheelchair Fred, how do you feel on this great day?  I'll be safe.  You don't expect to talk to eye to eye.  What?  You don't expect to talk to eye to eye.  Now, Dave didn't...  He wasn't one of the guys that you had sex with, was he?  No, but he was short.  No, of course not.  What are you trying to say today, Fred?  Dave was so darn short, I could look and see in the eye.  Dave was so short, you could look in the eye. 
[01:21:00]  From the wheelchair.  That's a great one.  That's all you have today, Fred.  That's it.  Okay, that's good.  That's good.  Oh, God.  Thank God.  It's a shame.  I'll be doing it for a girl to go.  I hate that guy.  Very good.  All right.  Well, Fred, thank you.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  There he goes.  Wheelchair Fred.  Had nothing.  Absolutely nothing. 
[01:21:30]  I thought...  Blah, blah.  Oh, that's great.  Where's the champagne?  I'm not gay.  I'm desperate.  Right.  That's what Dave's going to be saying now.  Out on job interviews.  I'm not gay.  I'm desperate.  I have the mustache.  He has the mustache for it.  That should be his line of work.  Tom, what's going on?  What's up?  I thought the big news out of Boston was Ted Williams getting frozen.  Oh, thanks for reminding us. 
[01:22:00]  But it's even better when Dave Dickless gets fired.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  All right.  Keep rocking.  Thanks for reminding us.  I guess we should step aside so we can get into the Ted Williams stuff.  Yes.  And other things today, but...  Who feels worse, Ted Williams or Dave Dickless right now?  As they saw through Ted's neck to take his head off.  Isn't that funny?  Dave's head went on the chopping block.  And Ted Williams' head is under a hacksaw as we speak, I think.  That's insane. 
[01:22:30]  We'll get into it.  Yeah.  Can you imagine it right about now?  Dave's wife.  What are we going to do?  Dave.  But what are we going to do?  Well, Poopsie, I've got some leads.  I've made some relationships in the years that I was there.  We've got to pay the bills now.  The kids have to eat.  You better get yourself a job before we go broke.  I can't take this.  You said you were a professional and now you're f***ing lost your job. 
[01:23:00]  I'm sorry, Schnookums.  It's all Rocco's fault.  That's who I'll blame it on.  That fat f*** sold me down the river.  Poopsie.  I don't care if you have to work at Burger King.  You bring home a paycheck, you loser.  I knew I should have married Johnny with a big f***ing d***.  I knew it.  My mother told me you were a waste. 
[01:23:30]  But I married you anyway.  I'm sorry, Poopsie.  Get off of me, you f***ing loser.  Shave that mustache.  All right.  All huddled in the corner.  Dave getting home in the corner crying, looking like Henry Hill after his cocaine was flushed down the toilet. 
[01:24:00]  And Goodfellas said,  Oh, no, I needed that.  What did you do?  Oh, what the f*** am I going to do now?  What the f*** am I going to do now?  We need that clip for the show.  Oh, yeah.  I've come in handy many times.  Oh, that's great.  Don't forget to call Rocco and remind him he's next.  Yes.  That is an ONA guarantee.  Let them know.  A guarantee.  Deacon, what's going on?  Hey, boys, how you doing?  All right.  I got one word for you, boys. 
[01:24:30]  Maximus.  Maximus.  Maximus.  Take care, boys.  Spaniard.  Spaniard.  Spaniard.  ONA.  We did that double sword off with the head thing.  That's it.  See?  See what happens?  You know your neck's fat boy, don't you?  You know it.  You feel it.  You feel it.  A little tickle on the back of your neck.  Ooh.  Ooh.  What's that?  It's called unemployment. 
[01:25:00]  Just talk to Dave.  All of a sudden, people walking around the station that are unfamiliar to you?  Whoa.  That is such a bad feeling.  Did they have security bringing Dave out?  Did they have security lead him out?  I want to know everything.  I want every gory detail.  Yes, I have a couple of things in my...  No, we'll get it for you.  Yeah.  No, just a couple of things in my office that, yeah.  This way, Mr. Dickless.  I was part of a hostile takeover in Buffalo.  They're not pretty.  Where they had armed guards and everything when they fired all of us. 
[01:25:30]  Armed guards.  This is a great, quick story.  I was working at the Fox in Buffalo.  The Fox.  And, um...  The home of rock and roll.  It's just that you have to say things like that.  You know how many home of rock and rolls I've worked for?  The home of rock and roll.  I've worked for the home of rock and roll on Long Island.  Yeah.  The home of rock and roll in Rochester.  And the home of rock and roll in Buffalo.  Maybe Dave is going to live at one of those. 
[01:26:00]  Is this the home of rock and roll?  Me and my wife poopsie need a house.  Please!  This **** can't even support his family!  Help me!  This is getting better.  I was going to stop.  But, you know what?  We've got to get going with this.  So, um...  We're working at the Fox.  And there was a hostile takeover by 97 Rock in Buffalo.  And, uh...  We didn't see it coming.  It was Memorial Day weekend.  We had...  Oh!  We had a ball.  Big special going.  Oh, we had a ball.  We were all partying and drinking and playing volleyball. 
[01:26:30]  And we had some kind of gig, you know, along the shoreline.  And we get to work on Monday.  They casually say, like, before we went off on our Memorial Day weekend,  We're going to have a little meeting, you know, 9 o'clock Tuesday when you get back.  Not much.  That's what they told Dave.  So we...  A little meeting.  Nothing to worry about.  So we get to the conference room, Tuesday morning, 9.15.  There are people we never saw before.  Obviously, like the owners and the upper people.  Uh-huh.  They close the door behind them, pretty much lock the door, and tell us, we're all fired. 
[01:27:00]  We're all in shock.  We leave the conference room, and we try to go back to our offices.  There's armed guards in every office.  Yeah.  One guy tried to touch his computer, and the guy just touches...  I swear to God.  Touches his firearm and goes, I wouldn't do that if I was you.  I don't think that's a good idea.  A lot of secrets in radio.  A lot of things that you could destroy.  Or, you know, there have been people that have come back and erased all of the carts that the commercials are on.  You know what a pain in the ass that is?  When you just erase everything, so they want you out of the building. 
[01:27:30]  No, Dave.  Know where I went?  Yeah.  Because I knew they were looking for us in the offices, because you could tell.  You saw them all over the place, but they weren't guarding the prize closet.  Oh, you hit the prize closet?  Oh, big time.  Big score?  Big time.  Nice.  So, there you have it.  That's great.  That is great.  Bye-bye.  Oh, it's coming for you.  Hey, what's that fin in the water? 
[01:28:00]  He's got a little Dave in his teeth.  He's got some Dave in his teeth.  I see some flapping around over there, and I see a 70s porno star mustache going through the water.  What is that?  Hey, it's coming this way.  He can't go down with a Dave in him.  Not with a Dave in him. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, he's under the boat.  I'm safe.  He's coming for you.  He's coming for you.  Can't wait for this.  Box up your condiments, fat boy.  Yep.  They're coming.  Pack them up.  Pack them up.  Pack them up.  Pack them up.  Well, have fun.  All right.  Now, we're going to be very giddy for the rest of the day.  Oh, that is so fantastic.  I wonder if Dave goes, look, you could throw pies in my face. 
[01:29:00]  Please, please.  Look, I need this job.  I need this f***ing job.  Oh, please.  I'll do anything.  Man, I will suck your...  Have some pride.  Get up.  Hello.  I work for Captain Hooks.  I thought I'd take the uniform off for the drive.  The boys at IBM expect something from you.  Wear the uniform. 
[01:29:30]  Have some pride, Dave.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry, Dave.  You can't come.  And stay out.  Dave, how would you like to mow my lawn?  Oh, that's fantastic.  Bye.  I need this job.  Please. 
[01:30:00]  I'll do anything.  I'll intern.  Could I be Rocco's intern?  Oh, God.  Bring on the champagne.  All right.  It's coming.  It's coming for you, Rocco.  You're next.  Let me lick that off.  Coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Three. 
[01:30:30]  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello, Boston.  Yeah.  Taylor's here from Philly.  Nice, right?  Nice.  Man.  She just got her pictures done.  They should be up on O.P. and Anthony.com.  Mr. Rick took the pictures.  Very nice.  She'll be entering the WOW content.  And we've been on a cold streak.  The last ten girls. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Yikes.  Yeah.  Hey, go to the O.P. and Anthony.com website.  Nice to see us stepping it up a bit.  Let's be blatantly honest.  Go backwards.  Go there.  Okay.  Let's start with 61.  No, we're at 74.  Oh, we're up to 74 now?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Portland.  What's going on?  What's up in Portland?  No.  What is up in Portland?  No.  74 and 73. 
[01:31:30]  72.  71.  Looks like Larry Bird naked.  70.  Iffy.  69's got some rack, man.  Wait, go to 69.  Go to the second picture down, though, because the first one's a little dark.  69.  Not bad.  Yeah, that's correct.  And that's the girl that listened to our advice. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Guaranteed she's fat below.  But said, hey, camera guy, just shoot me from the belly button up.  Now, the next one didn't follow the advice of the photographer.  Which number?  What are we looking at?  68, Anthony.  Crystal.  Holy.  Crystal.  All right.  Huge cans.  Boy, usually when someone says their name is Crystal, I think of something different.  Well.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  What?  The last picture in that. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, like the last one is that outrageous.  Look, look.  Why did you have to go and pass the first one?  What?  Oh, good God.  Nice cans.  Good golly, Miss Hall.  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of fun, that girl right there.  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  Oh, boy.  I like a belly button you can have.  Yes.  Or stash heroin in.  Her belly looks like Billy Staple's belly.  Oh, God. 
[01:33:00]  No.  This looks like a cartoon.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Yeah, Ant.  Ant will help us out with this.  That is hilarious.  All right.  Go back to that picture.  Okay.  Scroll down so our head is out of the picture.  So now you've got what's left is two boobs, a belly button, and her blue huge panties.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  It looks like a smiley face.  Smiley face thing.  But it looks like a cartoon smiley face.  Who does that look like?  Help me out.  Wow, it really does. 
[01:33:30]  It's like a Ren and Stimpy character.  Yeah, like a Ren and Stimpy character smiling.  All right.  Keep going.  That is fun.  That is.  You've got to Ren and Stimpy body.  Yo.  Contestant 67.  Hey.  He entered the contest.  No, we went there.  Stimpy.  You've got to go to 67.  67.  We're going up.  Oh, joy.  I'm in.  Sacramento proving that they didn't go to a strip club for this contest.  Now the real girls from Sacramento are coming out of the woodwork.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  And more bad tats, man.  Go to 66.  Rick, we did all those.  Go to 66.  I'm trying to.  I can't.  Chicago.  All right.  If you like the hoochie mama, she's all right.  Hoochie mama.  She's got a little hooch to her mama.  She can get it.  Rick, hurry, because this is boring for people that aren't following along with us.  Number 71 just ruined her boobs.  Helen Hunt with AIDS.  I don't know what.  Oh, Jim Norton's here.  Hi, Jim.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[01:34:30]  Boys.  Good to see you again.  Pleasure.  That is the worst tattoo I've ever, ever seen in my life.  Which one?  Which one?  The Contessa 71.  Oh, I know.  Know what that tattoo makes the boobs look like?  Like they're saggy messes.  Right.  Why would you stay?  Because it looks like it's shadow.  Because now, because the tat doesn't go right under.  She's got small boobs.  Explain the tat for the people that are in their cars.  It starts in the middle of her chest with a diamond shape.  Like on the breastbone.  Yeah.  And then this feather-like thing is going out and cupping the underside of each boob and 
[01:35:00]  ends almost under her armpit.  Looks like it's an underside of a bra, right?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But the tat doesn't go all the way up to the bottom of her boob.  So the point between the bottom of her boob and the tat looks like boob.  So it makes her boob look very flappy, like those flapping flapjacks.  It's awful.  What's she doing?  Let's go to Lowdown.  Hey, Lowdown.  Hey, this is Lowdown. 
[01:35:30]  Yo, number 68's midsection looks like Grimace from McDonald's.  Grimace.  Hey, Norman.  It is Grimace.  Hey, good work, sir.  Even after a long holiday weekend, I'm sure.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, number 64 looks like she has a melanoma on her boob.  I said that.  I think Contestant 64 has skin cancer.  And I'm not even kidding.  Hey, you can make two contests out of one.  You know, what the hell is that, you know?  I was reading about skin cancer.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was reading about skin cancer recently, and they say if you have one of these birthmark  things and it's not symmetrical. 
[01:36:00]  Exactly.  It's not symmetrical, and it's like different shades of red.  You may have a problem.  Wow.  And that girl should have that checked out.  Next scene, the boob contest.  Only one.  You guys are tough to please.  There's one guy writing in, oh, well hung.  Our buddy, well hung, from New Orleans.  How much beer do I have to drink to make the newest Wow Chicks hot?  Well, the last one we just got that Mr. Rick took pictures of.  Very nice.  Taylor's up? 
[01:36:30]  Not yet.  Oh, they're not up.  Yeah.  I saw the picture.  Taylor's pictures will get the bad taste out of your mouth.  Yep.  Definitely.  And we got another hot girl out there?  You know, the qualifying's going to end really soon, Anthony.  This year?  Well.  Yeah.  And then we're going to go into a four-week voting process.  Oh, is that?  This is like a presidential election.  I understand.  Didn't we say we're trying to get to 100 girls?  Yeah.  So we're up to, what, 75?  Yeah, we'll have 100.  How about we end at 100? 
[01:37:00]  100.  100 girls.  As soon as we get 100 girls, the qualifying is over.  She pretty.  Go to opianthony.com for all the details, ladies, okay?  Right.  $5,000 up for grabs, courtesy of risquevideo.com.  Ah.  I hope he's going to like that.  What?  Is she a Latino?  She's a little latte for you, my brother.  Yeah?  Is she cafe latte?  I don't know.  She looks a little lady.  Yeah?  She got the whole mix going.  Dude, yo, yo, man, come on, man.  Ben swung the mic over and it hit all dirty in the side of the face. 
[01:37:30]  And he freaked out.  He thought it was a billing club.  She's very pretty.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Type of gal, you walk up to her to dance, try to meet.  All right.  Or suckle on.  You sicko.  Well, we've got to be pretty careful about this next segment.  Huh.  Don't want to piss off Boston too much today, but the Ted Williams thing is getting out of  hand.  Well, apparently his family.  And I was a little sad to hear that Ted Williams passed.  Were you?  No joke.  A little sad.  Yeah.  Well, any time a legend passes on. 
[01:38:00]  The last few years of his life were pretty tough.  Mm-hmm.  I think it's an example to the parents out there.  That they should treat their kids much better.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe Ted Williams was a good father.  And this guy turned out to be a douche anyway.  Yeah.  Could you say Ted being a good father?  This guy, John Henry, one of his sons.  Yeah.  Has been living off his father's name for many, many years.  Yeah.  And there's been a lot of, you know, stories that have come out where, you know, he's made  Ted's son a lot of bats while he's, you know, retired in his little home there in Florida 
[01:38:30]  or wherever he was just to try to make more and more money.  And now this new idea is just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Um, well, his son, Ted Williams' son, John Henry, has decided he wants his father to be cryogenically  frozen.  You know, where they take you and they freeze you.  They suspend you in this, uh, liquid until it freezes you. 
[01:39:00]  Bring you back to life.  Until years and years pass and they come up with a cure for what killed you.  But, you know, when you're that old, what are they going to do?  What are they going to come back to?  Yeah, I know.  They're like two years tops after they get defrosted.  Well, the problem is they haven't really figured out how to defrost you where you're going to  be okay.  They just think it's going to be, you know what it is?  They think it'll be, we're thinking in terms of today.  If you're frozen and they take you out, the technology we have today, you know, they're  looking for the Star Trek type technology where like Bones can take that pepper shaker 
[01:39:30]  and wave it over you and all of a sudden you're not cured, but you can get hunger or something.  What a scam.  Yeah, it's a total scam.  You want to believe?  You want to believe immortality.  But, you know, there's also the other option that his son is talking about, which is the  DNA.  He's saying that if they preserve his head, just his head, that later on, this is real, 
[01:40:00]  right?  This is real.  If they preserve his head.  It says AP next to the story, right?  Right.  AP.  Okay.  You want to hear a clip?  Yeah.  Listen to this clip.  Are we ready over here?  Okay, go.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  And I said, we're not doing anything.  It makes me so sick.  That's the daughter, right?  Right.  The half daughter or something. 
[01:40:30]  She's at odds with the brother because she wants to have Ted's wishes, which were to be  cremated.  He was a very private man.  Just the fact that he's part of this spectacle now is probably as rolling in his cryo chamber.  I thought Ted's wishes were that the Red Sox would win a World Series.  Oh, you've got to go there.  Maybe this will be the year now.  They'll rally.  Maybe they'll rally for Ted and Ted can have some influence.  So John Henry wants to preserve the head of his father. 
[01:41:00]  Well, I guess he would like the whole body.  But he'll accept just the head.  Just the head because that's what they do, too.  Get this.  These cryo places, they figure if you can't afford the big chamber for the whole body,  they sell you on the fact that, look, we'll chop off his head.  Wow.  We'll chop off his head and then we freeze the head.  Because in the future, in the future, we'll be able to put that head back on something. 
[01:41:30]  We'll clone his body.  We'll have his brain.  See, that's what they get.  We'll have his brain.  Because cloning, if you clone the body, he'll just be a guy going,  Oh, I'm Ted Williams?  What?  He won't know.  But now they have Ted's brain.  So when the future comes along and they defrost him, he'll be fine.  Can I hear that clip one more time?  That same one?  Can I hear it?  He said, Well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. 
[01:42:00]  We can freeze his head.  It makes me so sick.  It's like something out of a zombie movie.  We can freeze his head.  And Fat Bastard is going to show up at the clinic and steal his mojo.  He's got my mojo.  We have another clip of the daughter?  Ted Williams' daughter.  He said that it would be really interesting to sell dad's DNA. 
[01:42:30]  There's a lot of people out there, he said, that would buy dad's DNA.  And there could be lots of little Ted Williams' running around.  This John Henry guy is insane.  First base, Ted Williams.  Second base, Ted Williams.  Third base, Ted Williams.  Catching, Ted Williams.  Right field, Ted Williams.  A whole team of Ted Williams.  How great would that be for the Sox?  A whole team of just Ted.  They already have that team.  They're called the Yankees. 
[01:43:00]  Ah!  That's a good one.  First base, Bugs Bunny.  Second base, Bugs Bunny.  Effing Yankees.  Williams was good, but he was never the player of the cheater is.  Oh, jeez.  Now you're going to start it.  I thought you were going to say he's never the player Ozzy is.  Oh, man.  But his head, though, that's got to be something.  Just freeze the head.  Ted Williams' head, people.  Ted Williams' head. 
[01:43:30]  Now this is memorabilia at its pinnacle.  All the cards, all the cards I sold over the years ain't nothing compared to sports figure body parts memorabilia.  That's what I'm into now.  And we're starting with Ted Williams' head.  We're going to clone him.  Look, I'm cloning right now in my laboratory.  We're going to clone heads.  Get it on FlexPay. 
[01:44:00]  $1,000.  $1,000.  $1,000.  $1,000.  $1,000.  Terrible, Kyle, Joe.  Cloning with some stronger arteries.  They tend to just bust open on them.  Come on, people. 
[01:44:30]  We got the babes' larynx again.  Up for pids.  I remember that from a few bits ago.  You know, if this guy John Henry could, he would just travel the country with Ted Williams' head in a jar.  Like a pickled punk.  Without a doubt.  He would do something crazy like that.  You know what?  The Sox should sign up Ted Williams' head. 
[01:45:00]  Could you picture it?  Come on.  They just put it out on home plate.  Try to pitch to that.  Ball.  Ball.  Ball.  Well, really can't seem to get a good pitch in on Ted Williams' head.  That's got to be hard.  That one high.  Again, high.  Right up by the eyes, that one.  Playing some chin music.  Just a bit outside.  He tried the corner and missed. 
[01:45:30]  Ted Williams, since coming back to Major League Baseball, has 175 walks.  Ball.  Ball.  That one again, high.  And he takes another base on a walk.  They'll roll him down there to first base.  Ted Williams' head.  What a season he's had.  Clemens with the pitch.  Oh, no.  He hit him.  He hit him.  Clemens again with the chin music.  That one gave him a black eye. 
[01:46:00]  But he takes his base.  Look at Ben.  He's disgusted.  Ben is disgusted.  Don't die in Boston, man.  Don't, don't, don't.  Not today.  You have to let the dug in over.  God forbid we talk about John Henry wanting to, you know, preserve his father's head.  This isn't coming out of the left field.  This is coming from reality.  The guy wants to do this. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  Wants to sell his DNA to sports fans.  We got Lou Gehrig's lymph nodes.  Lou Gehrig's lymph nodes.  You'll be the luckiest man on earth if you get this.  Pardon the pun.  Ted Williams' head.  People, look.  Look, I got it on my shoulder right now.  I'm the two-headed guy.  You could do this all day with your own Ted Williams' head. 
[01:47:00]  Be the life of the party with Mickey Mantle's liver.  The big sliver.  Just put it in a punch bowl.  It's self-basting.  Ben laughs at that.  Ben's laughing at the Mick.  Making fun of the mic.  Mickey's okay, but not making fun of a Red Sox.  There you go.  Yeah, I see where you are.  What, enough time went by that we could make Mickey Mantle jokes and it's okay?  You douche.  You douche. 
[01:47:30]  We got Billy Martin's windshield with his face still on it.  Billy Martin's windshield.  Look at his face on it.  It looks like the shrouded Turin.  All right, I'm in.  You got me.  Come on.  We got various Thurman Munson pieces. 
[01:48:00]  Various Munson pieces.  They're pretty tiny.  But we send them there.  You open it up.  You don't even know what you're going to get.  Look, I'm opening up my Thurman box.  Look, you don't know what you're going to get.  Look at your tongue. 
[01:48:30]  I got Thurman's tongue.  Limited edition.  Pick your own pieces.  You can order enough.  You can build your own Thurman.  All the king's horses, all the king's men couldn't put Thurman together again.  But you can if you order now on Fletch Pay.  It's all about cloning.  Just clone the pieces.  Clone the pieces.  I got a Ted Williams rookie head card. 
[01:49:00]  First edition.  Jim Mintan.  Jim Mintan.  Jim Mintan.  This guy holds the record for walks.  He's never hit a ball since being re-upped with the Sox.  Rookie card.  Ted Williams head rookie.  What are you going to pay for this?  And you could have the head cloned.  Oh, this could be rough. 
[01:49:30]  That could be rough.  Very limited edition Arthur Ashe's T-cells.  Very limited edition.  Ain't many of these people.  Had a hard time finding any at the end. 
[01:50:00]  We got Lyle Alzado's bloated steroid brain pieces.  His brain damn near popped out his head.  He had to keep that bandana around his head because his steroid brain was popping out.  Bob, you'll eat his finger.  Bob, you'll eat his finger.  Bob, you'll eat his finger.  And, of course, we got John Crook's cancer nut. 
[01:50:30]  Cloned anyone could have.  I played ping pong with him with my kids.  Hey, Bob from D.C. once in.  Yes, Bob.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know about the marketing campaign that Boston Red Sox are doing.  It'd be Ted Williams' bobblehead night.  It's a real head.  But there ain't no springs that would just fall soft.  Hey, Norton, love you. 
[01:51:00]  Thank you, Adrian.  There you go.  Dave DeBickey's arm.  Come on, we get it.  Ted Williams' head's on third.  Oh, boy.  Philly.  I think this city's going to start fighting again.  Kobe, what's up?  Ted don't lead much when he's on first. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, perfect for the Sox.  You put Ted Williams' head at first base, the ball never goes through his legs.  I love Bill Buckner, you sock suckers.  Oh, boy.  The cities are going to start fighting.  Hey, Norton.  Forget it, sir.  That was a low blow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Joe, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Lance Armstrong's left nut.  Buy it now.  Get it on Flixby.  I'll see you guys.  You suck. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, do you have Johnny Moses' legs, Anthony?  We got Will Chamberlain schlong.  Will Chamberlain schlong.  This thing isn't in Jim Minton condition.  Been used a lot.  It's a little frayed.  Hey, Keith wants to make a bid.  Yes, Keith?  Keith?  Yeah, I want to place a bid on Thurman Munson's altimeter. 
[01:52:30]  Thurman Munson's altimeter.  That comes with a lung.  Hey, don't you like the Mets have the manufacturers hand over trust any car?  Maybe you guys can make the, uh, any Yankee roll apart?  Thank you, Keith.  Well, look at this.  Coming up for bid now.  Vernon Maxwell's daughter.  Are you insane?  Up for bid now.  Let's clone her.  Cut her head off. 
[01:53:00]  We got Payne Stewart's frostbitten toes.  That was a cold flight.  Cold flight to nowhere.  Kind of twilight zone-ish.  Come on, he was traded.  Shut up, you idiot.  No, stop.  Come on, he was traded.  Like, that makes it all good.  Yeah, yeah.  That was very tragic for the Canby family. 
[01:53:30]  That's all I'm saying.  Carson from Waltham.  Jim Abbott's fleshy baby hand.  Oh, that's funny.  Maybe the Mets can clone Mo Vaughn when he was good.  All right.  Ran for yourself.  Well, we're going to send you Dale Earnhardt. 
[01:54:00]  You want him?  He's yours on Flex Pay.  And the whole thing comes in something the size of a paint can.  Hold on.  You can smell Tiger Woods' fingers.  How about that one?  No one's got to die for that. 
[01:54:30]  Smell the gauge on that finger.  Jason, what's going on?  What's happening, guys?  How are you doing today?  Good.  I just wanted to place a bid with you, Don.  I was wondering how much I could get the ball that killed Tony Kimigliaro for.  The ball that hit him on the head.  And the Red Sox do suck.  Later, guys.  Oh, boy.  This could be rough.  Yes, Joe.  I want to put in a bid for the Gale Saints, Brian Piccolo, backfield. 
[01:55:00]  Get out of here, you freak.  Yeah, boy.  Hey, Nicole, what's up?  You know, you can't just, like, lop off the guy's head and just stick it on something like  Lego figures.  You know, they've got to preserve his final form.  You don't know about the future, my dear.  I don't know, man.  You can't just lop it off and just stick it on somebody else's body.  No, I think they're giving up on bringing him back, but they want to use the DNA.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  Or this crazy, crazy son of a head.  Well, I'm here and preserve his head.  I just picture, like, this giant pickle jar, you know, and, like, his little head floating  around in there.  All right, Nicole, I've got to go.  You guys are nuts.  There's a good one coming in, Frank.  Yes, Frank.  Yo, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to place a bid on the stuffed Cory Stringer.  You missed the joke.  The life-size doll.  That's what makes it funny.  I'm sorry.  That's Cory Stringer.  Very good.  All right, guys, I'm out.  All right. 
[01:56:00]  All right, now we're getting a little rough.  Nathaniel.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Nathaniel.  I'm wondering if you have any of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team left.  All right, stop.  Paul.  I want to apologize to the Israelis today.  Yeah.  Jesus.  The LL security guard.  Oh, horrible.  Let's go to Eric here.  Yes, Eric.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Listen, John Henry Williams got it all wrong. 
[01:56:30]  All he has to do is get another sport for Ted Williams to participate in.  So why don't you just call Al Snow from the WWE?  And it's perfect.  It's a match made in heaven, guys.  What do you think?  He could be head.  Al Snow gets his head back.  There you go.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  Walt from the city.  Can I bid on Bob Murphy's memory?  It's okay.  I'm not using it.  That was a towering high fly ball deep to center field. 
[01:57:00]  Easily caught to end the inning.  With the score tied at nine apiece, we paused for these words from, what, I'm still in my garage?  Oh, I thought I was watching the game and announcing.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  As Ted Williams rolls to second base, we paused for these words from Budweiser, the king of beers.  Go ahead, Mikey.  I've got a bid for Donnie Moore's brain matter.  Oh, and it comes with the second place trophy.  All right, guys, I'm out. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  Okay.  We got George Brant's hemorrhoids that he was so proud of.  Look what I got up on my mantel here.  It's Joe Torrey's prostate.  Hey, Willie.  Hey.  What's up, Willie?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'd like to put a bid in on Dr. J's kid's manifold. 
[01:58:00]  Bastards.  Throw that crap out there and then hang up on it.  And then they run away.  And then it's, you know, and we have to deal with the consequences.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to ask Don West if I could put a bid in on Walter Payton's liver.  Walter Payton's liver?  That thing was ravaged.  Or at the very least, could I get Mike Utley's spine?  All right. 
[01:58:30]  Hey.  Hey, hey.  I want Len Bias' nostrils.  Jesus.  What does it do?  How would you like that Michael Jordan's pop propped up in your own room?  Use his head as a whistle.  Holy cow. 
[01:59:00]  It can happen now through cloning.  All the big sports card memorabilia places are selling the cloned sports figures.  Tony.  Yeah, I'm looking to buy a Dale Earnhardt skull puzzle.  That's a tough one.  But look, I'm trying to fit the pieces together.  There's a thousand of them.  This is worse than the 3-D White House I tried to put together.  It's impossible. 
[01:59:30]  And for Jordan's dad, you can fuse him in your car to get in that H-O-V lane.  It's going to pay for itself, people.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This one's in mint condition.  It's even still sealed.  It's Roberto Clemente's parachute.  All right.  Later.  Argentinian soccer team beef patties.  This stuff isn't that far-fetched if John Henry wants to sell DNA of Tim Williams.  Oh, boy. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  This is...  This could be rough.  Yes, Paul.  Yes.  How much for real?  Martina Navratilova's penis.  Later, douches.  Later.  I know.  You know what?  I know they dumped out of that, unfortunately.  He wanted to know how much Navratilo...  Navratilo...  Navratilo...  Navratilo...  Oh, my God.  I can't say her name.  Say it.  Navratilova.  Thank you.  Her junk.  Her junk.  Her mule. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Well, Nick has a little...  Oh, yes, Nick.  Nick?  Hey.  Okay.  All right.  Well, Joe has one.  It's sort of sports-related.  Joe?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, hey, hey.  Uh-oh.  There could be a problem.  Where's Pete?  Joe?  I don't know where he went.  He wants to put a bid in for Sonny Bono's skis. 
[02:01:00]  Hairy care is useless corneas.  Why is someone saying, and cut?  And scene.  Hey, man.  He's walking these days, Brian.  Brian.  Hey, what's up?  I want to know if I can get some of Dennis Bird's running shoes.  He changed the joke.  Stop it. 
[02:01:30]  He changed the joke on us.  Who wants a flu, Joe Aorta?  We got it here.  I cloned it.  All right.  Now we've gone too far.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I just want to put a bid on, uh, it's not sports-related, but Rich Voss is funny  bump because he ain't using it.  Love you, Norton.  Love you, too, sweetness.  Yeah.  Just when you thought it couldn't get worse.  Uh, Matt? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead, Matt.  I got the Kyle family shattered hopes and dreams.  Oh, okay.  Just punch it out.  I can't.  Ooh.  How do we always start with Ted Williams' head and end up in this quagmire?  Uh...  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, right.  I guess that's...  Can I put on Bill Buckner's luck?  No one wants... 
[02:02:30]  Pam Anderson doesn't play sports?  Yeah.  You...  Stay with the program.  Stay between the lines, guys.  Let me see.  Oh, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  That will really piss off, Buffalo.  And we're going there Saturday.  That is horrible.  You are the worst.  That... 
[02:03:00]  That will get a buffalo.  Let's save that for after we get back from Buffalo.  How's that?  All right.  All right.  He was crazy.  Stop it.  He would need a dunscap.  Oh.  All right.  All righty.  Well, I guess...  I guess that's it. 
[02:03:30]  Whew.  God, those get ugly.  I wonder when we go to break with some classic Bob Murphy.  People just...  Phone in and hang up.  The pitch.  High fly ball.  It keeps the left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Agbayani.  Can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I was sure he was unable to reach it. 
[02:04:00]  It's caught by Agbayani.  I apologize.  He was way out there, and it didn't look like he had a play on it.  But he caught it against the wall in left center field.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We still have jobs.  We still have jobs. 
[02:04:30]  Hello.  How about you, Dave?  How about it?  Did they give him the box?  You know, the big box that they got to give you?  Cardboard box when you clean out your desk.  Put the pictures of the family in there.  And little knick-knacks and bric-a-brac you might have gotten from some bands.  Right about now, he's packing up his gold records into a little box.  Putting them in the box.  Maybe a little plant that his wife gave him.  Yeah.  The world's best dad trophy that he got for Father's Day. 
[02:05:00]  Keeps it there on the desk.  Reminds him of the family.  Everyone around the station going,  Oh, dude, that's a bummer.  Hey, you want to go to Ebenezer's?  Yeah, we'll all get a drink.  We'll all get together and have a drink.  It's a real bummer.  You'll be all right, though.  You'll be fine.  Sure.  You're fired.  Yeah, we went over it earlier.  That's why you got to listen to this show a lot.  Payback today for the Opie and Anthony show.  One down, one to go. 
[02:05:30]  That's why we always say O&A always win in the end.  You do it like this.  It might take four years and three months and one day.  Our old boss in Massachusetts.  Dave Douglas.  Dave Dickless gone.  And we're all broken up about it.  Don't forget to keep reminding Rocco that he's next.  We like this.  Oh, he's absolutely next.  There ain't no denying that.  The new boss comes in. 
[02:06:00]  The old staff.  Gone.  Taking all these little things off his walls.  I'd love to see that.  God, I would love to see that.  Just taking this stuff off the walls.  All the little things that he had on there.  Hey, did he have a big AAF number one finger to wave around at some of the Sox games?  Oh, I think I'll leave that behind.  He's walking out with his box and the manager comes up to him and goes,  One other thing.  Your key. 
[02:06:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  We need your key.  Boom.  And we're going to be changing the codes so you can't come back in after hours.  They changed the lock codes.  But thanks for your service all these years.  Yeah, yeah.  We really appreciate it.  Now, get out.  But the fact is, Opie and Anthony kicked your ass after they came back to town.  And we've got to move in another direction now.  So, good luck to you.  Sorry.  And, yeah, best.  Best wishes.  Best wishes.  In your future endeavors.  Hey, dude.  Now you get the hell out of here. 
[02:07:00]  Is Don West still around the studio?  Oh, my goodness.  More items up for bid?  Well, possibly.  We haven't run a bid into the ground in a while.  We'll see.  We'll see if this one has legs for a second go around.  Just a piece.  Brandon from Buffalo, what's up?  What's up, guys?  First off, I got a bid on Dave Dickwitz's balls.  If you can find him in his wife's closet.  Because if he fired you guys, he's an idiot.  I love when Buffalo understands that old boss. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, dude.  Second thing, you guys are coming to Buffalo.  So, I can say this because I'm from Buffalo.  Yeah.  I'm not putting a bid in for Scott Norwood's white foot.  I got him with that.  Anything to do.  We want to burn it in effigy in Buffalo in downtown.  And if anybody can find the skirt for the Bills because they lost four in a row, we're looking for that, too.  And I'll see you Saturday, guys.  All right.  Well, Don West is going to sell Jim Kelly's Killer Instinct.  Dante, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Do you guys still have Darryl Strawberry's willpower up for sale? 
[02:08:00]  That's hard to bottle.  We do have pieces of his colon, though.  How about John Fox?  Pieces of the strawberry's cancerous colon.  I roll it up on a stick and blow into it like a party fever.  I'm down here in Philly live at Raw tonight.  Yeah.  And I just bought Owen Hart's bungee cord.  Owen Hart's bungee cord? 
[02:08:30]  Hey, tie it in the knot.  Try to use it yourself.  Oh, man.  You guys are brutal.  Hopefully, we'll have some representation in Philly tonight.  Hey, Ed, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey.  I want to make a bid on Joe Seisman's thigh bone.  Oh.  Oh.  That's a calf bone.  Calf bone.  Both of them.  Snap.  Hey, Morton, love you.  Thank you, sir.  What about us?  We do the show, too. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, I love you guys, too.  And we try hard, too.  When are you coming back to Philly?  Are we allowed to announce that?  I don't know.  You've got to ask Ben.  There's always douchebags that swear they're not going to get in our way.  And they're going to, you know.  Yeah.  They're going to try to help us, and they're not going to...  Ixnay, right?  Yeah, we won't.  I don't know that, bro.  We'll never be back.  You can announce it.  You can announce it.  They're going to F us.  I'll announce it.  It's done deal.  The little midget says to our face, no, man.  You know, we're all...  No.  We're one big, happy family, and I'm so glad you're going to be broadcasting live from 
[02:09:30]  OzFest in Philly.  Yeah.  And then behind the scenes, he calls all the bands and says, you go on Open Anthony's show?  You know, I'm not playing your record anymore.  Right.  That's how it works.  But the company likes to think that that doesn't happen, Anthony.  No.  That that doesn't happen.  We all get along.  We have confirmed interviews with a lot of bands, and if they don't happen, there's one  person to blame.  That's all I know.  Dave?  Yeah, OzFest, this Friday, Philly, the ONA show. 
[02:10:00]  Relax, Jim.  We'll get you your little picture with Ozzy.  Yeah, don't worry.  He messes it up.  I'll burn the building down.  That I can't wait to see.  I'll burn his building down.  I cannot wait to see Jim and Ozzy together.  And what a moment that's going to be.  Oh, I'm Mr. Osborne.  I'll actually be.  I've met him before.  I should be very mad.  Yeah, but you know what?  You're going to be talking to 21 cities, and it and I are going to shut our mouths and 
[02:10:30]  just watch you interact with Ozzy.  Yep.  Be quiet.  I'm not going to say it all.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's why it's going to be good radio.  All right.  Blubbering zero.  You will be his fan.  It's fantastic.  Yes, sir.  Watch me pinch my fat bosoms because I have nothing to say.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  The cities are really fighting.  Rob?  Yeah, I want to put in a bid on Ted Williams' World Series ring. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, that's right.  He never got one.  Oh, God.  Good point.  What did I say?  What's wrong?  Love you, Norton.  Boston, I want to apologize for that last phone call.  This could get ugly.  There's like a nuclear war ready to happen between the cities today.  What an ironic thing that would be if Ted Williams' head was brought back to play on the Sox and they won the World Series and he didn't even have fingers to put the ring on.  They'd just like, he'd either stick out his tongue or they'd just put it on his nose. 
[02:11:30]  Or his forehead like an Indian woman.  Just like, put it through his nose.  I do understand that the DiMaggio's World Series ring, they're going, if they can't auction that off, they're actually going to just auction the print of it off out of Marilyn Monroe's face.  Jeff, what's up?  Yeah, I wanted to put a bid in on probably Lemberg's blood alcohol level at a time of impact.  What'd you say? 
[02:12:00]  Who's in play?  Jeff.  Who's blood?  Hey, you guys blow.  Quick.  I didn't hear it.  No, no, no, Jeff.  All right.  I didn't hear you, dude.  Who?  Well, give me another chance.  I didn't hear it.  I said I wanted to put a bid in on Kelly Lindbergh's blood alcohol level at a time of impact.  Who?  Charles Lindbergh.  Hockey player, you guys.  Blow.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Flyers.  Flyers.  Crashed the force into a side of a wall.  All dirty says Charles Lindbergh. 
[02:12:30]  You know what?  I said Chuck Kelly.  Kelly.  I thought you were saying Chuck Lindbergh, too, and I was getting confused.  Yeah.  Now I get it.  The dude from the Flyers that crashed into a tree, right?  No, he crashed into a wall.  Wall tree.  Right down the street from my house.  Same ending.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  He still sucks.  All right.  Sorry, dude.  That was our fault, not yours, by the way.  Oh, it's fine.  All right.  Hey, opianthony.com.  Taylor's pictures are up.  Mm-hmm.  The latest contestant in the WoW contest, and she will be representing New York City. 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  Billy, we stole another one from you.  Those are some really good pictures.  We have a finalist, if not a winner.  Taylor's pictures are up on opianthony.com.  Those are some really good pictures.  And when is the Asian girl's pictures going up?  She'll be up any minute.  Another girl that came in here in New York today.  Gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous.  She didn't do no panty shots, though, right?  She didn't do a...  What?  Bikini bottom shots?  Well, Dirty, we're really having a good show today. 
[02:13:30]  It's a wild contest.  Yeah.  Be careful.  It's okay.  Girls can...  I'm trying to break the flow now.  Who knows?  Below the waist, girls can do whatever they want in these pictures.  You never know.  Maybe in 71, some napalm got splashed on there.  Oh, God.  Hey, Taylor wants to come in.  She's not good with a microphone, but she looks really good.  She looks great.  If her toilet broke, I would just go up.  Hey, Taylor, do you want the $5,000 in cash or a traveler's check?  Cash, please.  She might win the whole damn thing.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  No, I just wanted to give you guys another little flash real quick. 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  Oh, there they go.  Yeah.  So heavy and lovely.  Yeah.  Thank you, Taylor.  You're welcome.  All right.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Is anyone interested in Chris Reeves' equestrian helmet?  He's not a sports star.  He's not using it anymore.  Yeah, but he was involved in a sport.  He went with the Sonny Bono thing in it.  Oh, good.  Okay, yeah, right.  He was riding.  Let's give this bit a little more life.  A little more life?  A little more legs. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you, bro.  Later.  All right.  This is going nowhere.  The second.  The Muhammad Ali salt shaker shakes itself.  You just turn it over and hold still, and it shakes itself.  Comes with the matching Michael J. Fox pepper shaker.  Oh.  Look at him shake.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  Yes, Tim.  Yes, what's up, gentlemen?  Hey, bro.  I'm sorry to hear the beginning of the show.  I was in a meeting, but so Douglas is dead, huh? 
[02:15:00]  Dave Dichlis is done in Boston.  And, uh...  In Worcester.  In Worcester.  In Worcester.  Yes.  So, now what happens if Rocco goes?  What happens to me?  Am I gun?  Psycho Tim?  Am I attack the next guys?  Psycho Tim, we got a homework assignment for you.  Okay.  He's going to have to sell his house.  Okay.  Yeah.  You should haunt the house, kid.  I can, like, inflate the bidding.  I can call...  I can get, like, guys to call up and bid higher and lower or whatever.  So, then no one will buy it.  They're going to have to have an open house. 
[02:15:30]  And I think, uh, Psycho Tim needs to take a look.  Tim, yeah, we need you to go in, uh, with a camera.  Okay.  And, uh, yeah, take some pictures in Dave's house.  Okay.  No problem.  I'm sure Ben has the address.  Oh, I'm sure.  I'll have my, uh, real estate people work it up for me.  Yeah, we'll hook it up and then, uh, take wacky pictures.  I'll try.  How about I just burn the place down?  Yeah, that's more your speed.  There's Boston for you.  He'd probably love it.  They always take the easy way out. 
[02:16:00]  Of course.  Of course.  Well, obviously, Rocco's next to go because he's copying you guys.  There's no tomorrow.  Brutal.  All right.  Thank you, Timmy.  See you guys.  How are the, uh, motorcycle helmet wow stickers doing?  Pretty good.  I got a couple idiots from Jersey sent up to stuff with all stamps on them because they're  so stupid down there in Jersey.  But, uh, pretty good.  Jesus.  I'm giving my boy away.  Hey, uh, do you want to go see Dave's house tomorrow?  Yeah, well, where is it?  Before it hits the market?  You knock on the door.  I don't care.  All right. 
[02:16:30]  Hold on to the line.  Oh, God.  That was so funny.  Yeah.  No, hold on to the line.  We need him.  Stop.  Okay, we're going to break and, uh, regroup here.  Sure, man.  We still haven't heard about the fireworks thing.  Fireworks.  What a great...  We had one of the Gucci kids call up.  Really?  They wanted to talk fireworks with you.  Oh, groochie.  I thought you said...  I did say Gucci.  Gucci.  Hey, I got the jet lag from the LA thing.  It's going to be great.  We're going to talk about bags.  All right.  Gucci bags.  Gucci.  Gucci. 
[02:17:00]  Or...  I was just looking for one.  That one's marginal.  What?  Duck Ku Kim's fighting trunks.  Oh.  Maybe something more injury-related would have been funny.  Like his brain splattered on the inside of his skull.  We've been through that Ted Williams bobblehead doll there, Johnny. 
[02:17:30]  You don't have to send it 80 times.  Casey, what's going on?  Yo, I just wanted to call about that guy who was knocking on Ted Williams.  Yeah.  That is effing ridiculous.  Yep.  You've got to at least have respect for a guy who does something to like...  He is the greatest terror to ever live.  Jonah Maggio even said that.  Shut up, stupid.  You're right, actually.  People just...  We gave him major props, but we're talking about how his son wants to preserve his head.  And sell the DNA to fans. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know.  I just...  That guy was a jerk.  All right.  Thank you, Casey.  Get a hold of yourself, sir.  He wasn't very happy with that.  We understand it.  Everyone got some abuse thrown at him.  Yeah, just settle down.  We took care of every city and every legendary sports figure.  Relax.  Knit a doily.  People panic.  It's my guy.  We understand.  Don't worry.  People take this very seriously.  Just simmer down.  Hey, do we got any of those cute little bits we can play in to break? 
[02:18:30]  I don't know about this one.  Which one you got?  I don't know if we play that a lot.  Where's that latest one there?  I love how we just, you know, figure it out live in the air.  Yeah, might as well.  Yeah, the Wow Institute.  Sure, why not?  I'm not a doctor, but I do sound like one.  And I'd like to tell you about a condition plaguing the Opie and Anthony Best Wow Contest.  It's called Not Hot Enough, Sis.  It's sad, it's tragic, and it strikes nearly every day.  Hi, Jennifer. 
[02:19:00]  Hi.  Hi, why are you talking crap about my picture?  The Zapruder film was clearer and sexier.  She's got to lose.  Lose the face.  You know what?  I think you should take her down for a reshoot.  Believe me, Marlon Perkins is there today.  He'd be more than happy to take a couple of shots.  He should head down.  You know, I would back up a few steps before taking the pictures.  You know, get the camera guy there to back up a little bit.  Possibly have him back up to Cleveland.  Only you can stop Not Hot Enough, Sis, from wiping out the Opie and Anthony Best Wow Contest.  Get your pictures taken today. 
[02:19:30]  See OpieandAnthony.com for detail.  Brought to you by the doctors at the Wow Institute.  New girl up on OpieandAnthony.com.  New girl up.  New girl up alert.  We like alerting our faithful listeners.  OpieandAnthony.com.  New girl up.  We had some quality come through the doors today.  We're back with the O&A show.  All dirty in the studio. 
[02:20:00]  Just stopping by today, huh?  Look at him.  He's talking to Ray.  Dude, this is professional broadcasting now.  Yeah, I understand.  It's a structured environment.  Things are going on.  Timetables need to be met.  I'm not feeling this at all.  Yo, what's up, Noi?  That's like your 10th cup of coffee, kid.  Hey, that's good.  That's what 21 cities want to hear.  I didn't know.  It was really good, though.  I know I have nothing.  So I'm just going to sit here and watch the board.  O30's got the nervous chatter. 
[02:20:30]  Chatter.  We have the nervous chatter in here.  Chatter.  So they chatter.  Where guests come in, they don't know what to say, so they just start saying stupid crap.  So.  You got a goatee.  Hey.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you noticed that, though, when some people, they come in here and, you know, they don't  know what to say.  They feel like they have to say something, so they just start chattering.  Notice I've been doing it for a year.  No.  I, um, so.  Dude, you got a cut?  All of them?  Yeah.  Yeah, right. 
[02:21:00]  Why?  Did you get that haircut in Chelsea?  Oh.  A long elevator ride down.  I don't know what happened.  I mean, they're just, you guys are joking.  All right.  You guys are kidding.  All right, stop.  Come on, fun.  A little inside.  Now, someone out there got it.  Dustin Diamond.  What?  Oh.  Oh, no.  Part two.  Damn, bro.  You compare me to this cat, dude?  Yo, see, it's not always about you, old man. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  You compare me to Dustin Diamond.  We left you alone and went in a whole different direction, my friend.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Hey, I got to ask you something, because you're always on top of the conspiracy theories,  Old Dirty.  Yes, sir.  Old Dirty doesn't trust anything, Anthony.  Right.  Did you see the picture in the paper of our fine president catching a striped bass?  In the paper?  It's been in the papers, on the news, every paper.  It's one of those pictures that the White House puts out.  He went on vacation.  He did some fishing.  Hold on.  Let me see Old Dirty. 
[02:22:00]  I want to hear Old Dirty's take before we do our take.  All right.  Okay, Anthony?  What do you think, Old Dirty?  Because you're into the conspiracy thing.  The fish has obviously been caught for him earlier in the day.  I told you.  It's not fresh.  I told you.  Because you don't see him wiggling or not.  He's coming straight out the water.  It's a photo.  But you can get these things.  You know what I'm saying?  You can't hear it either.  Old Dirty's the best with the conspiracy thing, though.  He don't got the fishing pole in his hand.  Unless that lady took it for him.  You're never disappointed with the conspiracy thing, man. 
[02:22:30]  I knew you'd go with it.  No fishing line coming from the mouth of the wood.  Is this a big striped bass type fish thing?  Ant said it all in the back office.  Ant's convinced.  I'm convinced that he put the line in the water.  And Navy Seals are under the boat.  Right?  And they have a whole bunch of these big fish.  Let's see.  Do we give them the big one first?  Yeah.  Or do we start them out small and work our way up to the monster?  And they grab his hook, right?  They put it in the mouth.  Give it a couple of tugs.  And then they go, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And he goes, oh, I got one. 
[02:23:00]  And he reels it in.  And Old Dirty does make a good point.  Look at the tail of the fish.  It's coming straight.  The water that's coming off of the tail is falling straight down.  It's dripping right down.  That means there is no movement.  Side to side.  There was no movement on this fish.  That is a fake fish.  I disagree.  He's holding it the wrong way, too.  You didn't weigh the chain, did you, Doc?  It's not a fake fish.  The president went out and caught a fish.  It's a real fish, but I think they put it on the line.  That's one of those big photo ops where they just, 
[02:23:30]  W's hauling bass.  Ho, ho.  He lands a striped bass.  There's ice coming out of the fish's mouth, too.  They had it on ice.  Look, he lands a striped bass, hooked by first, co-first twin Jenna Bush.  Oh.  Right.  That's the hot blonde in the boat right there.  Yo, they don't like to, they like to get drunk, right?  Yeah.  Boy, one day they come through my neighborhood, kid, it is over. 
[02:24:00]  Chatter.  More chatter.  Just a little chatter.  More chatter.  Now he's starting to sweat a little bit.  Yeah.  You got the dumb sweats now, right?  You're all freaked out.  Dumb sweats.  You're not feeling like this appearance is going well, right?  Well, I haven't been here for a minute.  You know, been a private citizen for like a month.  A month?  A whole month?  A whole month, kid.  We're talking 30, 31 days.  Yeah.  You know?  Couldn't, wasn't able to listen to the show for a minute either.  Yeah, we gave the, we gave out the bat signal, hoping you would call on your dad. 
[02:24:30]  We need you.  And they were, they were dogging me through 15-hour days.  So, Anthony, you know.  You guys are fouled, bro.  You're so little love for a brother, you know what I'm saying?  Come on, man.  You know, all you're missing is your catchphrase t-shirt.  I've never noticed that a Dominican could like turn red.  You're turning red.  Yeah, I'm red.  You're dying, aren't you?  I'm dying.  I got the dumb sweats. 
[02:25:00]  Save your appearance.  Pull out your junk.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Hey, where'd everyone go?  Anthony Fireworks.  Ah, what a 4th of July I had.  We're going to go back to how the show is structured.  If you feel like something's happening here, you jump in, old dirty.  Yeah, but you ought to keep my mic on.  Don't feel like you could, you know, feel like you have to carry the show.  Okay.  All right.  We went out to... 
[02:25:30]  Pick your spot and jump in, all right?  Yes, Anthony.  All right.  It'll be my 4th of July.  We went out to the World's Fair Marina, right by Shea Stadium, and took a lovely vessel,  the River Rose.  The River Rose?  The River Rose.  What's their boat, the River Rose?  It looks like a big riverboat.  But why Rose?  That's so, girl, you've got to name your boat or girl's name.  How about the River Meat Pistol? 
[02:26:00]  That must have been taken.  Private boat's name is Rose, sir.  Here comes the old River Meat Pistol.  Down the old Mississippi.  It's the River Rose.  You know Billy Mac.  Tough guy.  Wimpy name for his boat.  Exactly.  Right?  I would never mess with Billy Mac.  There's other guys owning the boat.  It's just...  The name's a little rough.  Why?  It's a little faggy.  River Rose. 
[02:26:30]  It's like a...  What are we talking about?  Great double-decker boat.  Yeah.  It looks like an old riverboat, but done up really great.  Without the paddle in the back, you know.  It was one of those charting joints?  Yeah.  Went out there and, you know, Billy Mac is involved.  He totally hooked us up.  The beers, the Captain Morgan, everything great.  Went out to the East River.  And high security.  High security for the 4th.  Because the terrorists always pick those big holidays. 
[02:27:00]  Never the anonymous days like, you know, September 11th or anything like that.  Very high security on the holidays.  So, we're going down the river, down the East River, just crossing under the 59th Street Bridge.  And there they are.  The Coast Guard, the police boats.  It's like, oh boy, you know, I'd like to get a little closer to the fireworks.  How far are you from the fireworks at this point?  At this point, it's quite a few blocks.  You know, it's a few blocks down. 
[02:27:30]  They did it in front of the UN.  So, you know, we're up in the 60s.  You like us in the 60s?  Hmm?  Or it's in the 40s.  It's in the 40s.  30s, yeah.  It's up there.  It's just very wide.  Takes up a lot of room.  But we're above the bridge, you know.  Just passing.  I'm like, oh boy, okay, I kind of want to get close.  And Billy takes care of business.  I see a police boat coming toward the boat.  Like, hmm, what's up with this? 
[02:28:00]  They seem very friendly.  And then I'm noticing food being passed over to the boat as it gets closer.  I'm like, oh, okay.  This is great.  Then when the police boat kind of veers off, I notice we're going down the river a little further.  We ended up, the only people further down the river were the police and Coast Guard blockade.  And we were right next to the UN. 
[02:28:30]  It was right where the barges are that set off the fireworks.  And they got some great new fireworks.  Remember how they were saying, they got to get fireworks that spell things out or make shapes?  They got that down now.  Yeah, they got that.  Big stars.  They had a happy face.  Happy faces.  Yeah, USA spelled out.  USA was spelled out.  How do they do that?  I don't know.  They shoot them up.  And these things are like flying out.  And you see the big firework thing.  And in the middle of it is this big red USA lettering. 
[02:29:00]  And then 2002, they had that.  They had the happy face and these new helicopter-like things.  Like, you know, they go up and then hover for a while.  Go up further.  Go down a little bit up.  And they're flying all over the place.  Look great.  Then the music, of course.  They play the national anthem.  And they get to the rocket's red glare part.  And there's nothing but red rocket.  It was amazing.  And then you look at it off of the U.N. building.  All glass on the side of the U.N.  And the reflection looked just as good as the fireworks display. 
[02:29:30]  So we got a great view.  And Billy Mac, thank you so much.  And the crew.  The crew of the River Rose.  Thank you.  Well, Dirty, how was that?  And Rick held the boat up.  Rick did?  I got laid.  You held the boat up.  Yeah, what?  I got laid.  You got laid?  You got laid.  I thought that's what he said.  I got laid.  How late were you, Rick?  To be laid.  I was just ten minutes late because the World's Fair Marina signs were everywhere.  Not very well laid out.  You know what it was? 
[02:30:00]  There's like a bunch of people on this boat.  And we're like, well, where's Rick?  And Billy's like, oh, I just talked to him.  He'll be here.  Now, a whole charter boat full of people are waiting.  Why aren't we leaving at six?  Oh.  Because of Rick.  Oof.  It wasn't that bad.  Aren't Spick's known for being late anyway?  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, old Dirty, how were the fireworks in the hood?  Oh, they were all right.  We were watching them on Channel 4, dude.  You don't get out there and buck buck, fire a few rounds off? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, fuck.  The precinct's like two blocks away.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I know the old days in the neighborhood.  Oh, yeah.  They would just get out there and fire off their 12s.  M-80s.  We had all that.  Sticks to die.  We used to try to tie in like four, five, six M-80s at a time with duct tape and try  to make a fuse to make them all go off at the same time.  Correct.  Bottle rocket fights.  You used to light up mats of firecrackers on the super's door so he wouldn't be able  to get out because all he'd be hearing firecrackers in the hallway.  So you'd hold him at bay with the fireworks on his stoop. 
[02:31:00]  Blowing their M-80s on the coin return, dude.  What?  I haven't seen a fireworks list go around in years.  Like in the neighborhood, dude, there used to be this fat lady.  She used to live on the third floor of this other project from down the block.  Dude, homegirl had artillery shells.  She used to have like, we used to work for her.  She had like three or four, you know, little kids.  Oh, go out and get me customers.  She used to give us like mad mats of M-80s and bottle rockets and all that.  But once Giuliani came in and threw that, that was over. 
[02:31:30]  In the hood, do they call those little things that flitter down the street of people neighbor  chasers?  Nah.  Yeah, there's a name for that.  Do they call them?  I was just wondering what they call them up there.  Yeah, they call that, man.  Are they?  They call a neighbor chaser.  Neighbor chaser, right?  Yeah.  Break off the stick, you know.  Yeah, you break off the stick of a bottle rocket and you throw it on the ground.  It gets radar, you know.  And it chases the neighbor.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  How that word just gets into everybody.  Like it gets into fireworks and the Brazil nuts.  Remember that around the Thanksgiving table in Italian families?  The big Brazil nuts, the big brown ones.  I know, it was like, pass me the nigger toes.  And fireworks, it was like, oh, yeah, fire off a nigger chaser.  It's like, how did that word just get used so much?  And fireworks could be chasing anyone. 
[02:32:30]  Why not the chaser?  Oh, the speak chaser.  The Jew chaser.  It's never that.  The Guinea chaser.  Hey, Claude, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, they're a rough neighborhood.  You've got to stay away from them come July 4th.  Especially if you've had a fight with someone in the neighborhood.  Because July 4th is when they come looking for you.  Because with all the firecrackers going off, they could easily put a couple of caps in your ass with no one noticing.  So that's Revenge Day in the hood?  Yep. 
[02:33:00]  That's Revenge Day.  And another thing is don't pay your rent on July 3rd.  Because blockbusters will go in the mailboxes come July 4th.  So there's a lot of unpaid bills coming this week.  It looks like a Yankee ticker tape parade.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  There's a good tip for July 8th.  Knife.  They used to.  I remember when they used to get.  Everyone would get the list.  At work.  No matter where you were.  Not just uptown or anything.  You'd get the list. 
[02:33:30]  And you go, all right, man.  Check off what you want.  And I'll deliver it.  You get your money.  And you'd have the list of M-80s and bottle rockets, Roman candles.  And you'd check them off.  And then you'd get your stash.  That just disappeared.  There are no.  People do not have private fireworks anymore.  They got those ones you could send for.  When you go south of the border and bring them up.  No.  It's crap.  I don't want the sparkle fountain.  That's it.  Ooh, sparkle fountain.  You put this ice cream cone looking thing upside down on the ground. 
[02:34:00]  Light the top.  And it goes.  Ooh.  And, like, glitter and sparkles come out of the top.  No explosion.  No nothing.  It sucked.  Anytime I wanted fireworks, I was looking for M-80s and blockbusters.  Then big rockets.  Bottle rockets.  Giuliani put a stop to that.  Bottle rocket fights used to be the best.  Bottle rocket fights.  You get the tube, a round tube from wrapping paper, the cardboard tube that wrapping paper comes in.  Oh.  You're set. 
[02:34:30]  It was.  A bazooka guy.  Right.  Hey, we didn't get to talk about, uh, Imus.  Imus.  He thought he was the next Elvis, and we didn't talk about, uh, the Michael Jackson thing.  No.  We're running out of show here.  Black-o-jack-o.  He's, he's, he's off the hook with those comments, man.  He just, he just came back to the neighborhood, and he decides that this rhetoric is going to be acceptable.  You know what I'm saying?  He's trying to, he's not even right.  He's using it as a promotional tool.  He told him, the brother came and bleached his skin, and all of a sudden he's going to turn around and say, oh, that, that, he, this guy, and this cat is racist. 
[02:35:00]  What, what did you do, my brother?  You ain't even the original color.  You came out the womb.  No, the Jews have nothing to do with this.  He came, he, he's not even the color he came out the womb from, kid.  Right.  He's totally bleached.  And he's going to talk about the other cat's racist?  Oh, man.  He didn't even like his own color.  Oh, there you go.  And nobody bought his album, man, because it sucked.  Word.  Word.  It's hard to believe no one is rushing out to buy a pedophile's new record. 
[02:35:30]  You know what I'm saying?  And he gave 30 mils to, to, to get rid of the kick, touch, charge.  He was still selling as an alleged pedophile.  Sure.  I know it, man.  Yeah.  It's all about the fact that, yeah, the album blows.  You know?  Hey, uh, Anthony, Anthony, um, plans the perfect wedding.  Oh.  Got a little bit.  Really?  A little, a little bit.  Oh, let's listen in.  And then we'll come back and, uh, finish the show, okay?  All right.  You're getting married.  No, no.  Here's Anthony from the Oakley and Anthony Go to help you plan the perfect wedding. 
[02:36:00]  I'm talking to you.  Oh.  Are you listening?  First, you must carefully choose a wedding ring for your gal.  I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station, and I think I spent, um, 300 bucks  on it.  Right.  Well, you should also make sure your betrothed gets along with your dear, sweet mother.  Your f***ing son is a scumbag.  Eh, maybe not.  Your wedding night, on the other hand, should be a magical one. 
[02:36:30]  I believe, uh, I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of, of regret and sorrow  rolling down the sides of my face.  Just follow the simple step, and you'll have the perfect wedding.  Just like Andy.  Eh, I got nothing.  I was shocked.  I was horrified.  I was broke.  Hopeless.  What did I get myself into?  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave.  Never married a lot. 
[02:37:00]  I was a broken, beaten man, and I had been married for six hours.  Let's talk to Lorraine and Manny on the ONA show.  What's up, guys?  Hello.  Did we lose them after all that?  Hello.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  You tell us.  ONA.  Yeah.  Hey, we're, uh, we're in for sex with Sam.  Can you hold on?  Lorraine, come here a second.  We'll get Lorraine.  Lorraine, hold on.  ONA, hold on, please. 
[02:37:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Huh?  We're in for sex with Sam.  Hello.  Everyone say goodbye to Taylor.  She's leaving us.  She qualified for the WOW contest today.  Our pictures are up on opiananthony.com.  She will be representing New York City.  Yes.  Even though she's from Philly.  Philly sucks to be you today.  Doesn't matter.  Here's another hot piece of A from you.  Solid.  Go ahead, guys.  Oh, my God. 
[02:38:00]  Lorraine, Manny.  Yep.  What's up?  Hi.  You want to go in for the sex for Sam?  Yeah.  All right.  We're from the mini state.  Oh, my God.  Do they sound hammering.  You guys are hammering.  You guys are hammering.  Are you guys drunk?  No.  I'm not.  You want to try out for sex for Sam?  Huh?  Oh, boy.  You want to try out for sex for Sam 3?  Yes, I do.  What do you guys want to do? 
[02:38:30]  What do we want to do?  Oh, boy.  You want sex for Sam, brother?  What do you want to do?  Oh, my God.  You want everything, brother?  All right.  Hold on.  Terrific.  Jake and Vicki called in.  Rick.  Phone call.  We've got to start qualifying couples for sex for Sam 3.  Yes.  We need couples.  We'll start that tomorrow.  We'll start that tomorrow.  Sex for Sam 3 is going to be a huge event this year.  Of course.  It is every year.  A trip to Boston with us when we broadcast live from the Sam Adams Brewery. 
[02:39:00]  It's going to be a great, great time as they do their summer jam.  And we do the sex for Sam every year.  Sex all around New York City.  Okay.  Walter.  Yeah, guys.  Listen.  Hey.  I just walked to the sports center.  It's official.  Ted Williams' body is frozen.  Did they do it?  Yeah, they did it.  And then they went into this whole spiel about fake autographs and all this.  It was pretty funny.  They really froze Ted Williams' body.  They really froze his body.  And then his son, they said about his son, he's going to take a lot more heat because of 
[02:39:30]  this, but he doesn't care.  Because they're talking about selling his DNA.  Right.  What a toll.  That's odd, man.  Because they've got to do it fast.  Well, of course.  You know, I've got to get it while the guy's still warm, yeah?  Okay.  Thank you, Walter.  Take it easy.  Bye.  You know what?  I'm all for the DNA with Ted Williams.  If you're going to have a kid, give him DNA from a guy who's a proven winner.  That's the problem with the world.  There's just too many genetic messes happening.  Williams' body now in cryogenic warehouse in Arizona. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Can I ask, is it just his head?  Yeah.  I want to ask something.  Yeah.  Maybe we can get someone out there that has experience in this.  All right.  Now, the son wants just the head.  No, the son wanted the whole body, but he said it would be okay if it was just the head.  How do they get just the head from a body?  Get out the hacksaw, dude.  You just got to cut it off.  We're going to answer that question tomorrow on the show. 
[02:40:30]  How do you just get head?  How do you just get head?  There you go.  Yes.  Because you got the body.  Yeah.  But the head's connected.  And you just want head.  Just want head.  Not the body.  Give me head.  Hmm.  All right.  Interesting, then.  Yeah, I don't know how you go about that.  We could go with this for 20 minutes, huh?  At least.  I never thought of using the axe or hatchet approach, but, man, I'm going to try that one for some head.  Sure. 
[02:41:00]  But I don't love you.  No, just the head.  Okay.  Bleacher Anthony, today I learned that the Red Sox would have won the World Series in 1986 if Ted Williams' head was playing first base.  Jay Dykes from Baton Rouge.  Too bad we couldn't freeze the head of Linda Lovelace.  Why let death stop good porno?  Yo, that would have been ill.  Did you hear what former Boston teammate Johnny Pesky said? 
[02:41:30]  He goes, it's just terrible.  You know, these old gruff guys.  It's just terrible.  Death is terrible enough, but you've got to have a little compassion.  That's a goddamn shame.  I hope John thinks twice about this.  It's just not a good thing.  That son is twisted.  He is a twisted guy.  John from Staten Island.  I apologize to the entire city of Boston before I read this one.  He says, hey, Ben. 
[02:42:00]  What's the difference between Ted Williams and his former team?  Ted Williams and his former team.  Well, the Red Sox wait until September to die.  Oh, wow.  Hey, that's funny.  Ben, I'm sorry you had to hear that.  Very mean-spirited.  That wasn't good.  Very mean-spirited.  It certainly is.  Okay.  Lorraine and Manny.  Hey, Lorraine.  Oh, wait a minute.  She's right here. 
[02:42:30]  Hello?  Lorraine.  Yes, sir.  You and Manny want to participate in sex for Sam in sex for Sam.  Now, do you know what this entails?  Excuse me?  Oh.  Do you know what this is?  No, not really.  Why?  See, you and Manny would have to go around different locations that we pick out around Manhattan.  In other words, you and your brother and have certain types of sex at those locations for points. 
[02:43:00]  If you then have more points than anyone else, any of the other teams, you will win.  Uh-huh.  So, do you have a problem having sex with Manny?  Let's say, let's just pick the Empire State Building.  No.  Yeah.  What drugs are you guys on?  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are we doing?  Nothing.  What drugs are you doing?  Stop it.  No, I don't do drugs.  You're smoking pot.  No, I don't smoke pot.

If you had to say between one and ten.  Huh?  Ten.  A ten?  We mean ten being the best and one being the worst.  I think you're confused.  No, no, no.  Ten.  We're not using, uh, Russian rules here. 
[02:45:00]  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.  Yeah.  What does she look...  She is a ten.  What does she look like?  Just describe her.  Did you ever look through the...  Look, you can't say that.  Listen.

[02:46:00]  Lorraine.  I was listening to the N.E.W., and then one day, she was going to...  Can you name me some past names?  I remember Carol Miller.  Manny.  Yeah.  How much does Lorraine weigh?  Be honest.  Lorraine, about 110, 120 top.  How tall is she?  About 44.  By four?  All right.  She's...  Okay.  She just sounds weird.
