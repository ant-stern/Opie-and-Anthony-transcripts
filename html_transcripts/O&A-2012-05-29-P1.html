<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony complaining about microphone issues.  Mars, a former frequent guest, was in the studio, and became the subject of jokes about his weight gain.  Their conversation drifted to Mars' Memorial Day weekend, prompting a discussion of informal, often raucous, outdoor gatherings.  The bulk of the show then focused on Sam Roberts' upcoming wedding, a remote event that concerned the hosts due to its inconvenient location, potential for inclement weather and bugs, and the questionable menu.  They expressed anxieties about the behavior of guests like Eastside Dave and Troy Kwan, referencing Erock's past wedding experiences for comparison.  Sam's unfinished vows and entrance music choice were also discussed, along with sexually explicit jokes and speculation about attractive wedding attendees.  The hosts made numerous jokes based on offensive stereotypes.  Concerns were raised about the seating arrangements and the potential for disruptions from various guests.  The wedding guest list was discussed, noting the absence of Danny and Travis, while humorous suggestions for plus-ones were made.  Concerns centered on Roberts' "tough guy" groomsmen and their potential reactions to the show personalities.  Opie planned an incredibly inappropriate and offensive toast, further fueling the anticipation of potential wedding chaos.

E-Rock's exclusion from a Memorial Day gathering at another show member's home created minor conflict.  A UFC fight and a sexually charged discussion surrounding a tweet by Jenny Hutt featuring a picture of her 18-year-old niece followed.  This led to an extremely vulgar segment playing and dissecting a song by Drew Boogie.  The graphic image of a man whose face had been allegedly eaten by another man under the influence of "methadrone" (likely bath salts) was extensively discussed, with callers, including "Doggy Daddy," sharing their experiences with bath salts. A rehab worker described the drug's effects.  Hypothetical wedding disruptions, ranging from gazebo decapitations to mass food poisoning, were explored, along with a bizarre Coney Island takeover proposal from a caller, "Bobo."  Wedding DJs called in, sharing stories of death and fights at their events.  The hosts then shared personal anecdotes about family tragedies, including a car accident resulting in the death of one host's father and another's father undergoing numerous surgeries.

The show continued with a discussion of car accidents near one host's childhood home, focusing on drunk driving incidents, including a car crashing into a house.  This transitioned into sexually explicit jokes about the female driver involved. The conversation then shifted to Memorial Day programming and war movies, including impressions of Dale Dye, critiques of "The Green Berets" and John Wayneâ€™s Irish accent in "The Quiet Man."  They reviewed "Men in Black 3," "Chernobyl Diaries," and a poorly-made Animal Planet mermaid special. A major portion then focused on a critical discussion of Chris Hayes' Memorial Day comments questioning the use of "hero" for all fallen soldiers, leading to a heated debate with callers expressing varying opinions, all while employing offensive language.

The final segment heavily criticized the 2012 US Presidential election. Anthony repeatedly used the phrase "blurting out shit" to describe his own commentary style, as well as those of Bill Maher and others.  They used derogatory terms and offensive language while discussing Mitt Romney's potential running mate, Donald Trump's candidacy, and Barack Obama's presidency.  The segment concluded with Opie promoting his upcoming stand-up show at Foxwoods, highlighting the similarly "blue" humor of the other performers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, everybody. Hi.  What day is it? Tuesday?  Tuesday.  What's that? What's that?  Am I, um...  Well, now I sound weird.  Really?  Yeah.  It doesn't sound as, uh...  AC.  Like you guys sound loud in the headphones.  No, no.  I don't.  Turn it up. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, turn it up.  No, but then you got it.  What?  Ow.  No.  Something's amiss.  I don't know what the fuck.  I could do this over here.  What?  How's that?  Turn me up.  No.  No?  No, something's fucked.  Maybe you're losing your hearing.  What?  Were you shooting rounds?  What?  Maybe you got a ringing in your ear.  No.  No, there's definitely something wrong with this setup.  You guys are fine.  You sound good to me.  I hear it in the headphones.  You guys sound nice.  Love volume.  Crisp.  And mine is this, uh, kind of, uh, muddy, um, and the volume isn't as loud. 
[00:01:00]  Now, I know it sounds good to everybody else.  It's my headphones that are not right or something.  You think Mars would run in here?  You think Mars would.  No, why would he?  Ah.  You think Mars would run right in here?  He's probably measuring his barrel chest.  He's trying to get a handlebar mustache so his body looks right.  That's stupid.  He should be holding two dumbbells with weights written on them.  That stupid body is his.  Look, I know age has taken its toll on all of us because, what, we've been on satellite 
[00:01:30]  eight years?  Aids?  Oh.  But, uh, wow, Mars.  Yeah.  Big drop-off since we all met him eight years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was, uh, yeah.  Big fucking drop-off.  Mr. Physically Fit.  He was actually in pretty good shape back then.  Yeah.  He used to spar Poe and all that.  What happened?  He's not sparring anyone.  No.  Man.  Man.  Oh, man.  And he still has a run in here to, here he comes.  Ah.  Look at him.  Marcelino.  Ah, it's Mars. 
[00:02:00]  Look at him with his tight UFC shirt on.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, a pride shirt.  What up?  Well, it's not the headphones.  See, the problem is, if it was the headphones or anything, they sound fine in my headphones.  I don't.  I sound low and muddy.  Anthony feels that the quality of his audio is lacking.  Yes.  And the quality of my content is lacking.  That's non-existent.  You know what?  We're all looking at his barrel chest. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  What do you think?  Fucking North just killed you.  Oh, boy.  I'm covering up.  I don't want people to look at me like we're looking at you.  How was your Memorial Day weekend, Mars?  Very good.  We never talked about your festivities.  Yeah, why don't you have festivities?  Why is that?  Yeah, but you have one of those hoochie mama barbecues.  A hoochie mama barbecue.  Yeah, they have them all up and down the Hudson River.  Oh.  I call them hoochie mama barbecues.  I've heard them.  Those are called spicknicks. 
[00:03:00]  Spicknicks.  They call them that, too, right?  Yeah.  Those are the side of the road ones.  They like that Riverside Park.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You've never heard that, Jimmy?  No.  Oh, it's great.  They used to do it on the, what, Northern State Parkway?  Northern State Parkway.  Anywhere there's a bunch of grass.  They would make believe their car broke down because it's some nice grass.  Yeah, there's nice grass.  It goes up the side of the highway.  They put their hood up, and next thing you know, they got lawn chairs.  Oh, there's hibachis cranking.  This is amazing.  It's kind of sad, though, that somebody wants a little green grass so bad they go on a highway and do it. 
[00:03:30]  That makes me sad.  It's not even a bit they actually do this.  How's that?  Oh, wow.  Way better, right?  Yeah, it's a little better.  What'd you do for Memorial Day weekend?  I don't know.  Something with these headphones.  I've had time with the family.  Yeah, but didn't you do a barbecue or something?  Yeah, I got a backyard, man.  Oh, shit.  You don't have no backyard.  You people don't have no backyard.  Yeah, Mars, you can take these headphones.  They suck dick.  Lucky them.  Wait.  Breaking news, though.  He's trying to tell us he has a backyard.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, right.  A backyard.  That's right.  I have a backyard.  I pay a lot of fucking taxes for that backyard.  How many people do you share the backyard with, though?  No sharing.  No sharing of the backyard?  I do share the Garden State Parkway.  Do you use the backyard?  Because this is a car parked on the front.  I'm just kidding, Mars.  I don't mean that.  That's very racist.  So did you have a barbecue?  Yes.  But you hear what he said.  He shares it with the Garden State Parkway, going back to our point.  They say they love the parkway.  And you knock that fence down to give yourself a little more area, don't you?  I could walk right to the Garden State Parkway from my backyard. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  So that's pretty funny.  So you kind of consider it yours.  Yeah, that's right.  I pay those fucking taxes.  That's right.  Can the people on the parkway see your yard?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  So it's kind of like, ah, look what's going on over there.  Yeah.  I got to work on my fence.  What exit do you buy?  151.  Oh, okay.  Why would he give you out your location?  Well, that's where Erock lives.  Is that really where you live, Erock?  I guess.  I don't know the exits and all that.  Is it what?  How do you get home?  You don't know the exit. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, what do you fucking star navigate?  I don't take the turnpike or the parkway or anything.  What, are you religious?  Exactly.  What do you look for, cloud formations?  How do you get home?  Huge.  He looks for the Big Dipper and then he uses it for ice cream.  He just did it.  Sorry, you're ice cream.  Erock fat joke.  I didn't mean that.  Right off the top of the show.  Are you going this weekend, Erock, to Sam's wedding?  I thought Sam got married already.  Why?  You got married.  I thought you eloped.  No.  That's what I heard.  You got married.  Congratulations to Sam.  Congratulations.  I was just hoping it was true so I don't have to fucking drive up there. 
[00:05:30]  No, you got to.  God damn it.  How far of a drive is this place?  It's so far away.  Is it?  It's crazy.  How about this?  I was coming back from Boston yesterday and it was halfway home.  Oh, God.  It is way the fuck up there.  It's a couple hours.  Why don't you fucking do it?  Why didn't you do it close?  You don't live a couple hours from here.  Why didn't you do it close?  You live 20 minutes from here.  Why not fucking find a wedding hall in your town?  VFW.  Exactly.  Elkslage.  Because Westchester and...  Bestchester. 
[00:06:00]  Westchester is a Bestchester.  And Manhattan aren't exactly known for being affordable for venues.  Oh, my God.  Cheapskate.  Come on, you fucking skinflint.  We need cheapskate.  Chisler.  Manhattan is notorious for having the highest prices anywhere.  Hopefully you'll save some money inconveniencing everybody.  Exactly.  I'm okay with it.  Right.  I'm sure you are.  Totally fine with me.  You're kind of not.  What the hell, man?  You do six radio shows.  Fucking...  Yeah.  Should we get married in Manhattan?  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, there's something...  There's one factor, though, between the radio shows and the paying for the venue that doesn't 
[00:06:30]  add up.  I'm mad because I thought you got married already.  Why?  You didn't get married?  No.  When are we getting married?  This weekend.  You just...  Meaning you and Chisler said we.  The royal we.  But it was that we, how you use it for other people.  Sure.  Oh, Jesus.  Who's her maid of honor?  Her friend from high school.  Travis?  See, I'm implying he's a faggot.  Correct.  Yeah, who?  Her friend from high school.  Oh.  Is she cute?  Yeah.  Uh-oh, what's the matter?  Why are you looking like that?  Did you use the banger? 
[00:07:00]  No.  You don't want Jimmy to talk to her?  Is that what that look was?  Yeah, what are you, a cock block being a body?  Oh boy, look out.  What was that about?  What if I want to get blown in the meat locker downstairs?  You guys are in the meat locker.  You guys are coming back to the show very hostile.  I haven't slept.  I'm tired.  I've been up since yesterday.  Me and Jimmy are going to be wolves at that wedding.  Wolves?  Yeah.  I'm okay with that.  Fucking smelling every seat.  As soon as a woman named Roberts gets up, I'm putting my face on that chair.  Why are you here? 
[00:07:30]  You should take time off before your wedding.  What for?  Just to fucking chill.  I'm chill.  You don't know how to use excuses yet.  You're not chill.  I'm chill.  I never chill.  I'm taking Friday off because you're getting married.  I'm not taking Friday off.  I'm taking it off so I can go up there.  It's that far away.  You're taking Friday off?  Travel day.  I'm taking a travel day.  You have to take Friday off so we can take Friday off.  What's wrong with you?  That's true.  Hey, fucking Adam Ant.  What's wrong with you?  We can't take Friday off if you don't take Friday off.  I said you were taking Friday off, so we take Friday off. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  If the show takes Friday off, then I'll take Friday off.  No, you're supposed to be the leader on this one.  You're the lead on this because it's your gig.  So are you guys going to say?  It's your deal, Wade.  And then I go to the bosses and go, look, you know.  You can't do a show without Sam?  Not necessarily that, but like, you know what?  Sam's getting married.  I'm going to take Friday off.  Take a day.  But if you're working, then we can't do that.  Look, selfish Sam.  You're selfish.  That's his name.  Why would the listeners point that out when I'm trying to give them a live show?  Because you're fucking selfish.  They don't need that many live shows at this point.  Exactly.  They're exhausted listening to this crap.  You want to save a couple of shekels so you fuck us over. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  And now you're not even going to take Friday.  Because he doesn't want to waste a day.  That's all it is.  Yeah, yeah.  Take Friday off.  We all expect in a short week and we get to take Friday off.  Yeah.  If you guys want to take Friday off, I'll take Friday off.  You need to take it off for your wedding.  You really need to take it off for your wedding.  Plans to be made.  On the day of your wedding.  And then we go, you know what?  We're going to take Friday off too.  It just seems logical.  Yeah.  Okay.  These dummies will fall for that.  But if you're fucking working, then we're fucked.  Fall for it.  Yeah.  Take the day off Friday.  Please take the day off so we can take the day off. 
[00:09:00]  That's all.  E-Rock took the day off before the day of his wedding off.  Right.  And you did, but we still did a show and we spent that show shitting on E-Rock's wedding.  So I can't take off that day.  Wait, why did I take off?  I don't know.  You decided to take a travel day to go to Jersey.  And I lived the closest to where he got married.  Right.  It was pretty much down the block.  Are you taking time after the wedding?  Are you taking like honeymoon days?  I won't be here four days after the wedding. 
[00:09:30]  Four days?  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.  Wow.  Where to?  We're going to Bermuda for a few days.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Bermuda Triangle.  Wow.  That's what I'm worried about.  Are you a little worried about flying through the Bermuda Triangle?  Yeah.  I remember hearing about that in school.  Oh, boy.  Do they still fly through the Bermuda Triangle?  I don't think anything's happened in years.  It's been a while.  How about ever?  After they figured out like fucking guidance systems and everything else.  Nothing to do with UFOs or Atlantis.  Right.  Bloomberg's there every weekend.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  It's never gotten lost in the Triangle once.  And you, what the fuck?  Is Jess bringing nice bikinis over there?  I don't know what she's bringing.  How do you not know?  She didn't let me see what she was packing.  Oh, God.  Maybe something exciting.  Did you?  Probably condoms.  Nice.  Yeah.  Are you fucking looking forward to that?  Yeah.  The condom-less fucking?  That's going to happen.  When's the last time you stuck it in?  Oh, man.  With or without a condom?  Anyway.  It's been a week.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:10:30]  And you wear a bag?  While you're saving up.  Did she say put the bag on first?  Have you tried to slip it in?  No.  Oh, man.  It takes away the fun and excitement of the exercise.  Oh, you're okay with that?  Yeah.  Do you say like, I don't want to put a bag on?  She goes, you have to.  It's like, it's okay.  I'm going to put it in your ass.  I've never tried it.  Wow.  Why wouldn't you have told me that months ago?  I know.  That's a little trick.  I don't know these things.  Do you wear magnums?  No.  Good.  That was really disturbing.  He should wear one in his mouth.  It would be a 57 model. 
[00:11:00]  See?  I'm implying you should blow your brains out.  I actually thought you meant you should blow some guy with a big dick.  Oh, that's true, too.  Do both.  Gun first.  And suck it with your fucking brains leaking.  That's terrible.  Well, I can't wait to see the Robertson Uptials.  It's going to be fun.  Exciting night.  Yeah.  This is going to be fun?  Yeah.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Are you guys looking to have a kid right away?  No.  Like I said.  Well, then what about the fucking without a bag? 
[00:11:30]  There'll be some pulling out going on.  Oh, boy.  So why don't you do that now anyway?  Sometimes that doesn't work.  I don't understand why you were saving your condom-less sex for marriage thing.  Because for fun.  What?  Like, it's like.  It's not fun.  What's fun about that?  What's fun about fucking with a condom when you don't have to?  Exactly.  It's like not eating pizza for a month, and then how good does that slice taste?  Let me think about that.  You know what I'm saying?  Really good.  Yeah.  Well, especially if you eat it for a month with a condom on your tongue.  All right.  A latex-y. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, I forgot how good this tastes.  That sucks.  That pizza was awful.  Yeah.  Rubber pizza.  In hindsight.  Huh.  So how long have you been wearing a bag?  Months.  Oh, wow.  I mean, we talked about it months ago.  We've talked about all this.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  It's been a while.  But how long?  He's ready to pull that bag off.  Yeah, I don't know exactly.  I don't remember.  It's been months easily.  Yeah, because from when we talked about it.  Now, when does the bag go on?  Is she manipulating you with her hand a little bit?  Maybe some other hijinks and shenanigans?  And then you decide, all right, I'm going in. 
[00:12:30]  Got to put the bag on.  It's such a distraction.  Does she put it on with her mouth like a hooker?  That's a great trick.  They just pop it in the mouth and go, walk, roll it down.  I got fooled a few times with that one.  Did you?  Yeah.  Wow, she's going, oh, fuck.  Yeah, she likes me.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Does she help put it on?  Is it like a couple thing?  There's foreplay activities, and then I apply the condom.  Do you apply it while you're like, like when she's not looking? 
[00:13:00]  You ever say like, get on your hands and knees so I can do a little ass eating?  And then while you're doing some ass eating, you fucking slip the bag on?  Is that how it works, Sam?  That's a loaded question.  Yeah.  No, that's not how it works.  Do you make a big thing of it like, here it is, and you open it in the pack?  You know what this means.  Oh, I hate these things.  Do you like comment on it?  No.  That kind of would ruin the mood, wouldn't it?  That would ruin the romance.  It's called the condom ruins the mood anyway.  No, you do.  The thing stinks. 
[00:13:30]  You don't need it.  Is it going to be hot this weekend?  That's all I want to know.  It was supposed to be.  Really?  Probably.  It's going to be really hot?  I was screaming that Sam Roberts is ruining my fucking weekend.  Yes.  Well, you're going to, I mean.  What is going on?  A limited amount of weekends that I got to work with, and I got to spend one fucking in the  asshole of paradise up there.  You realize you're getting married like a hundred miles away from right here.  The ceremony will be out.  A hundred miles.  Ceremony shmerimony.  I'm not going to that thing.  It's right there at the same place.  Oh.  Now you're worrying about it. 
[00:14:00]  That outdoor ceremony thing never works out, by the way.  It's an outdoor ceremony?  It's in the same spot.  You're going to have some shade?  What are you, a rom-com?  Fuck that.  You're going to have some shade?  Yeah, I guess so for us.  Did you guys look into mosquitoes and shit like that?  Shade.  What about, what if there's bugs?  It's black.  If there's bugs, I don't know, more the merrier.  I hope it rains frogs.  I hope something really biblical happens.  Flaming hail.  Yeah, what if it rains?  If it rains or rains frogs, we just move the ceremony inside. 
[00:14:30]  Frogs.  Frogs.  Frogs.  Frogs.  Frogs.  Frogs.  He lived in England for a while.  Don't we have a hurricane coming?  I don't know if we have a hurricane coming.  I think we do.  That would be great.  I think we have a hurricane coming.  If there's a hurricane, we'll move it inside.  Do you, Sam Roberts?  Yeah.  Have to guess, can't make it because of the hurricane?  That would rule.  That would be me, too.  A member of the bridal party is a breast ripped off by a piece of flying aluminum siding.  Jimmy's just violent.  That's not me.  It's an act of gun.  Oh, yes.  Corrugated tin. 
[00:15:00]  Jimmy takes our scenario too far.  That could happen, though.  Why would we have the ceremony outside if there was a hurricane happening?  Because it's cheaper.  That's why.  We would move inside.  It's the same price.  We've already paid for it.  Oh, the same low price?  Yeah.  It's not a low price.  It's just not Manhattan prices.  Do we have to eat chicken fingers the whole time?  Oh, God.  You can eat whatever you want.  Are you sure?  I'm positive.  I didn't get a menu yet.  You picked a thing when you RSVP'd.  I did.  What about the fucking earlier, you know, before dinner thing?  That whole...  Tocktail hour? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, what do you got?  What, do we have to fucking drink your homemade soda?  I'll bring some homemade soda if you want.  Oh, God, no.  Are we allowed to have a beverage?  Some soda stream?  Are we allowed to have a gentleman's beverage?  Or are we allowed to drink soda?  There'll be lots of adult beverages for everyone to enjoy.  What about...  Do you have a carving board?  I don't think we have one of those things.  A cheese board?  Do you have a...  Do you have a shrimp station?  Do you have a shrimp station?  I don't remember.  I like them scrimps, yo.  Why don't we outside in the heat?  That's going to be fucking awful.  I don't know, man.  It's just a little ceremony.  I would have taken a gig this weekend if I knew we were standing outside on fucking launchers. 
[00:16:00]  It's going to be squishy when we walk.  Squish?  I don't know if it...  From all the rain from the hurricane that's coming?  There's no hurricane.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  You should turn on the weather chat.  There's a hurricane coming.  If there's a hurricane coming, we'll go inside.  Hurricane warning!  Oh, this is cool.  I want to know if this is true.  Will there be an ice sculpture of Hulk Hogan?  No.  No?  Oh, that's a fantastic idea.  That is a pretty good idea.  I would absolutely have that.  Do we have to do the chicken dance?  No.  Or any kind of line dancing?  No.  You sure?  No?  Maybe cha-cha slide. 
[00:16:30]  What's a cha-cha slide?  What is that?  It's like the new electric slide.  We're not doing no cha-cha slide.  Well, you don't have to, but I think the cha-cha slide are we...  Is your mom going to be screaming, crying like a black woman at her kid's funeral?  No?  No.  Oh, my baby!  Oh, my baby!  Like, because you're leading...  You know, you've got a new woman in your life.  Right.  No, no.  And your mom is very possessive of you.  Is Pop waxing the mustache as we speak?  Getting it ready?  A little special waxing.  I think so.  Yeah?  It's a big day for him.  We ain't doing this shit.  This is the cha-cha slide. 
[00:17:00]  We're not doing the cha-cha slide.  If anyone tries to get me out of my fucking chair to dance at the Roberts wedding...  You're not going to dance at all?  I am not dancing at all.  You do.  You will slow dance.  I do, yeah.  I think it's Cialis before the wedding.  I'm going to say to Miss Roberts, may I have this dance?  And then you mush it up against her upper thigh.  I'm going to fucking blast your heart on against her leg.  I'm going to fucking point my rod sideways and just grind it on her groin.  You should be so proud of your boy.  Let's all take Cialis and dance with us.  One after another. 
[00:17:30]  That would be hilarious, man.  I cut in and just fucking press a bigger rod against her.  She'd feel so good about herself.  Yeah, she would.  Can we do this, Sam?  I'll warn her ahead of time, and then she's dancing with you guys anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  She'd be like, oh.  She keeps trying to get sway to dance with her.  Sway coming?  No, I don't think us.  Any darkies coming?  Oh, Jesus.  That's not what you'll say.  Well, he has darkie friends.  No.  I have black people as friends, but I believe.  African-American.  Oh, you chose not to invite him to your wedding? 
[00:18:00]  I think Stan from the morning mashup might be the only black person there.  Is the mashup coming?  Yes.  Oh, the entire mashup will be there.  The whole mashup will be there?  The whole mashup.  You think they'll go around to the bar all together?  Of course they will.  And they'll sit together?  They'll have group dances.  They'll do everything together.  They disgust me.  They're awful.  They're only going to have 20-second conversations the whole time.  And then just more music.  Is that all they do?  What a bunch of zeros.  Don't find a real job.  You're doing nothing here.  I can't wait until that fucking thing blows up. 
[00:18:30]  What day?  To that fucking show.  I can't wait until that ends.  Oh, it's going to be ugly.  It's going to look like the fucking ring after Silva Velasquez.  Wow.  That was some blood, huh?  Yeah, that was great.  What a great fight.  Well, Sam, I did map it.  It's halfway to Boston where you're getting married.  Holy shit, man.  I saw the exit on the way home and I still had a long fucking ride.  There was nowhere with comparable prices any closer.  We also liked the venue.  Oh, no, you don't.  No one likes the venue. 
[00:19:00]  What's good about the venue?  It's the same thing every wedding is, right?  No.  A couple plants up and a few candles.  Right.  It could be any venue.  You got a chandelier, right?  They got a chandelier.  What are you paying for?  What do you like about the venue?  It's just got...  I like the...  I like it.  I like where...  Ambience.  Oh, boy.  I was going to try and say that.  I like where the ceremony is.  Under a tree?  And then you go inside.  What kind of tree?  A willow tree?  There's plenty of those.  You could have gone to the fucking mill pond over there in Centerport.  Well, they could get married on Long Island because that's where you live.  It would have been convenient for us. 
[00:19:30]  That's a great idea.  Can we change this?  No.  Can we do this already?  It really is a nice spot.  We didn't even look on Long Island.  Why?  It's fucking beautiful.  We don't live on Long Island either.  As far as outdoor weddings go, fucking Long Island is the capital.  It really is.  A lot of outdoor weddings.  Because they got the water right there.  They got the water in New Rochelle.  What water?  The sound.  Yeah, but you didn't do New Rochelle.  You didn't do that either.  That's Westchester.  Your landlocked fucking wedding is going to stink.  There's not a pond nearby?  There's a pond.  A pool with a pond.  Whatever. 
[00:20:00]  Whatever.  There's a pond.  I didn't know it was outdoors.  I know.  It's just outdoors for a second.  Then we're going indoors.  This wedding gets worse by the fucking minute.  Oh, I went to the ceremony and then we go indoors.  Oh, I took the receptionist outdoors.  No, the receptionist.  Oh, that would be so bad shit.  How are you going to guarantee that we're going to stay cool outside?  Yeah.  I'm not going to.  We're going to be sweating our balls off.  Figuratively, we got it.  But literally, how are we going to stay cool?  And then everyone's boxes and assholes are going to start stinking from all the sweat from outside.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Then we move inside.  Oh, man.  It'll be like 25 minutes, maybe.  My cream-colored Pablo Escobar suit is going to have a fucking asshole sweat stain on the back like a skunk. 
[00:20:30]  I'm going to try to be dancing with a young lady.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Is your dad going to get, like, swamp ass from being out there?  I don't know.  He'll be standing.  His dad bag is going to be stuck to his leg.  He's marrying Sam.  That's a nice little gesture.  He'll be standing performing the ceremony.  Yeah, I know.  That's weird, man.  It is a little weird.  A father shouldn't do that for his boy.  You should have said no to that, I'm thinking.  Why?  Why don't we call your dad up now and tell him he can't do the ceremony? 
[00:21:00]  That can't be real.  Probably sleeping.  He's not legally.  That state, is he?  You get Justice of the Peace to observe, and you're striped.  So he's not really doing it?  He's doing it.  No, he's not.  That's like taking your kid to work day.  Yes.  The Justice of the Peace is the one that's really doing it.  He just stands there.  So I could stand there at someone's wedding and say I'm marrying them.  No, no, no, no, no.  The Justice of the Peace just stands there.  I don't think marriage is legal with God, by the way.  And then the other guy.  I don't think we do it properly.  You could perform the ceremony, but the Justice of the Peace would just have to stand there. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  Basically, your father's driving like fucking Rain Man in the driveway.  Yeah.  He's not doing the real wedding.  He really isn't doing anything.  Dude, this is fucking weird.  Not good.  He's performing.  That's weird.  It's the ceremony part that he's doing.  Why?  Did he bring it up or did you say, Dad?  I want you to.  Jess did.  What is wrong with her?  Is she just trying to undermine this from the start?  No.  It's traditional shit that people get involved with.  Why?  Really?  She saw him perform a wedding for our family friends.  And went, oh my God, we need that.  And she goes, that would be nice for our wedding.  Is she crazy?  Nope. 
[00:22:00]  That's weird.  It is better than just fucking having to meet a dummy for a couple weeks and then they marry you.  Do we have to hang out with this guy who's marrying us?  Does he get the right of the first, you know, fuck too?  No.  He gets a ticker in the back like Caligula.  Yeah.  And fucking, uh...  Like Braveheart.  Wow.  The guy's just got to sit there and watch his chick go up on the horse.  I don't even think he wants that.  No?  Never been brought up.  No.  That would be weird.  You didn't tell us why you liked his venue.  It's nice.  It's very vague.  Well, I don't know. 
[00:22:30]  It's a venue.  There's a lot of vagary going on here.  There's no vagary.  Is it going to be comfortable?  What time is this ceremony going?  Yeah.  I think like five-ish.  Till when?  Probably 11.  So what are we going to do after?  I'm not staying in the fucking hotel at 11.  I'm going to get tucked in and relax.  No.  Oh my God.  There's nothing going on in that town either.  The after party is after.  Go to Mystic Seaport the next morning?  Shithead.  Are we close to Mystic Seaport?  I don't know.  I don't either.  What's the after party?  You're in a weird fucking town.  I'm going to look up your town right now.  At the hotel bar?  Right after the bride fucking cuts the cake, the Anthony is going to hop in a fucking car 
[00:23:00]  and go back down to Long Island where this thing should have been.  And so is the gym.  Where this thing should have been.  The stupid does the fucking chicken dance in upstate Connecticut.  If I'm an asshole.  There's not going to be any chicken dance.  It's funny.  All your wedding pictures are going to have Hartford in them.  Fucking boo.  Fucking boo.  God.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Oh my God.  You're literally in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  It is.  There's nothing going on, right?  What town is it?  I'm not going to say what town is.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to say.  Oh. 
[00:23:30]  Wow.  That would be silly.  The paparazzi is going to show up for you.  No.  Fucking idiots will.  You're lucky we're showing up.  That's what he means.  Idiots.  Here you go, boys.  There you go.  That's where we're going.  Holy fuck, man.  Now look how far away that is.  You might as well take a ferry.  I could literally go to Montauk Point and it's faster.  Wow, Sam.  You're way up there.  Can I take a ferry?  Sam, I don't think you could take a ferry.  Whoever you want to bring.  Yeah.  Ferry.  I had it for years. 
[00:24:00]  Wowee, Sam.  This is crazy.  No, that's the other guy.  What?  Which one was Ferry from JFK?  Oh, David Ferry.  Yeah, David Ferry.  That was him.  Oh, okay.  Had it for years.  Had it for years.  I got one fucking weakness.  That's Sam's father after performing the ceremony.  And they defrocked me.  So he's going to say the words and shit.  Yeah, he's writing his own ceremony.  And now, oh, he's writing his own ceremony.  Right.  You're writing your own vows.  Yeah, but except I wrote my notes for my vows and I was going to finish them this weekend. 
[00:24:30]  How'd that work out?  I lost the notebook.  I don't know where it is.  What are you fucking five?  Someone has it?  I don't know where it is.  Good news.  I found this.  So I got to rewrite them.  Good news, I found the skyline of the place we're going to.  Oh, no way.  Let me see.  Dude, there's nothing there.  That's the official skyline.  Is that the hotel right there?  No, we're not near any water.  No, no, there's not a lot going on.  But when we went up there to get our license, some guy who owns a funeral parlor stopped  me in the parking lot because he's a fan of the show.  Oh, cool.  Oh, boy.  I hope we need him on the fucking... 
[00:25:00]  This just sounds like a clusterfuck.  They consolidated the city and the...  It's going to be great.  And the town.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, they had to consolidate the city and the town.  Well, guess what?  We're not taking a tour of the town, so don't worry about it.  Yeah, no shit we're not.  Originally, a busy sailing port.  Oh.  And then an industrial center.  It is now largely residential.  Yeah, but the thing about it is it's not a tourist location.  I'm not taking you all out for a good time.  Yeah, no shit.  Say that again.  You just get to go to the wedding, and then you go home.  The total population of the city and the town, 47,000 people. 
[00:25:30]  Wait till we get there.  What time does it start during the day?  It's at five.  The ceremony?  Yeah.  So I should go up that day.  I'm not going to go up the night before.  How are the rooms?  No, I'm not going up the night before.  I'm going up the night before.  I'm getting a room just in case.  I'm getting a fucking car.  I'm getting a limo.  And I swear I will be out of there so fucking fast.  Are you getting a limo?  Yeah.  That's a pretty good idea.  I'm getting a limo.  They're going to fucking take me up there, and I'm going to snooze on the way up.  That means you'll-  And I'm going to snooze on the way back. 
[00:26:00]  That means you'll have pool time Sunday.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Correctamundo.  Are you going to stay till the very end of the ceremony, of the reception?  What?  Till the very end?  And then go to the after party?  I am not even going to be around when people are picking up those fucking centerpieces and  going home.  I will so-  I'll already be just bubbling in the jacuzzi.  Yeah.  Me and Jimmy.  Yeah.  Touching each other's cocks.  Exactly.  Yeah.  See if we can fucking get our cocks to come up with a bubble before breaking it.  It's a game we play.  It looks like a spaceman. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  It's called cock in the bubble.  I'd hate to take you away from that.  Yeah.  See?  Oh, boy.  People think you've got a moon bounce.  What's a moon?  Instead of a dance floor, because it's cheaper.  Oh, my God.  No.  There's a dance floor.  Ball pit?  No, ball pit.  That would be nice, though.  That would be fun.  Where's the kid stuff?  Because you're kind of a kid at heart.  There's no kid stuff.  Chicken fingers?  I don't remember if it was just chicken fingers.  I don't remember much about the food.  It's your wedding.  What about the broads?  Yeah.  How is that situation looking?  Who's coming to this wedding that's, you know, attractive? 
[00:27:00]  What's going on?  Well, yeah.  We're the goers.  Any sluts?  We're the goers.  I don't know if there's any confirmed sluts.  No.  But Jess has some single friends that are going.  There'll be a couple single girls who work here that are going.  Are they picture-rooners?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Picture-rooners?  Any fatties?  Yeah.  I don't think there are any fatties.  No?  No.  No fatties.  Good.  You don't want that in your wedding party.  Right.  I want to do a little butter churning with my fingers, if you know what I mean. 
[00:27:30]  That's not what you mean.  Malbert.  Butter churning.  Yes, it does.  It looks like they do a little of that up there anyway.  So who do you think?  You know the wedding, the bridal party, right?  Yeah.  So who do you think?  First names.  Who do you think is good?  Yeah.  I mean, in terms of who's the best looking, probably Jess is made of honor.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  But that's like the big catch right there. 
[00:28:00]  That's the big catch.  Does she have a boyfriend?  Yeah, but the boyfriend.  What the fuck?  But.  Okay, go ahead.  Boyfriend's not coming.  Where is he?  Why?  He's smart.  He's in Brazil.  Why won't he come to?  Brazil?  That's where she lives.  What is he, a fighter?  No.  Is he Brazilian?  There's other people.  What is this?  Why wouldn't he come to the big wedding?  I don't know.  He's not coming.  Is she Brazilian?  Yes.  Does she have that ass?  Yes.  Jesus.  I thought you were going to say accent.  Or accent, too.  Wow, that's silly old me.  So she has a good ass, Sam?  Yes.  Kind of a dick move, I'm thinking.  What? 
[00:28:30]  Why wouldn't he come to the wedding?  I don't know.  It's a big wedding for this.  They got their own thing?  They got their own thing going on.  We don't want to go when we're an hour from there.  Imagine a nine-hour plane ride to this fucking shit fest.  To that fucking shit fest.  It's going to be a great wedding fest.  To hear his dad is awful.  Do you promise to milk my son's bag?  That's not part of it.  Is that part of it?  Definitely not.  To step on his cum until his dick is empty?  Until death do you part?  No.  That's your vows?  No, there's nothing to do with it. 
[00:29:00]  You said you wrote your own, right?  No, I wrote notes and I lost them, so I've got to rewrite them.  Oh, I hope someone's having a good laugh at your fucking stupid heart.  Jesus.  Heartfelt words.  Yeah, your heartfelt words.  No, my vows will be good.  Give us a rough idea.  I have no idea.  I have to rewrite it.  Come on.  You have to have one line.  What did you say?  No, I was writing things that I like about her.  Uh-oh.  And then things...  Give us one.  Does it rhyme with pagina?  Yeah.  Well, I look for her vagina.  Give us one.  Give us one.  What rhymes with gag reflex? 
[00:29:30]  Give us one.  What rhymes with three-holer?  Sorry.  Give us one, Sam.  One thought.  One quality of hers that I was going to highlight.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  Her supportiveness.  Oh, God.  It's really romantic and deep.  That's very good.  I appreciate your supportiveness.  The same thing I thank fans for in emails.  Yeah.  Your supportiveness.  My accountant supports me.  Thanks for your supportiveness.  Your supportiveness.  Oh, this is good, yeah.  Her generosity and being a genuine human being. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Those are all sociopathic things to say about somebody.  They're detached.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Once I figure out the wording, you guys would be like, oh, my God, he's so romantic.  Okay, hold on.  The wording so far.  Supportiveness.  Generosity.  And supportiveness.  Her supportiveness.  And what else?  Genuineness.  Genuineness.  Yes.  You're genuinely supportive and generous.  How many things with G-E-N are you going to...  And nice. 
[00:30:30]  And she likes genocide.  Nice.  Nice.  Genocide.  You would assume someone's nice.  How about genitals?  I want to hear about those.  You're going to be very disappointed.  So, what else?  What other attributes?  I'm very excited.  You using this song, by the way?  I don't know.  You don't know anything.  It's a nice song.  Yeah, you fucking don't know shit about your own wedding.  What's one of those wedding songs?  This is before the famous one.  No, I know what I got to pick.  She picked.  Da, da, da.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. 
[00:31:00]  She picked all the coming in music.  Are you going with da, da, da, da, da?  Probably.  That's Here Comes the Bride, right?  Yeah.  You're supposed to play that.  Yeah.  Yeah, she picked all the coming into the ceremony.  Who's walking her down the aisle?  Her dad?  Yeah?  You don't even know?  Who else would?  Her dad?  I know.  Well, that's why I didn't say that.  Because I wasn't sure if, you know, there's a family thing going on there.  He couldn't be happy about that.  No.  Why?  Hand it off to the likes of you? 
[00:31:30]  Exactly.  Is your mom walking you down the aisle?  No, I'm not walking down the aisle.  You should walk down the aisle with your mom.  No, I'm a man.  I don't walk down the aisle.  But she wants to be part of this.  Yeah, she really does.  She's going to walk down the aisle.  She wants to give her boy away.  I'll walk her down.  I'll fucking eat your walk down.  I'll link arms with her.  We're all going to link arms with Bobby.  Get a little elbow tit on the way down.  Is she going to ceremoniously remove the condom for the first time?  Oh, yeah, shit.  She gets the fucking garter thrown out.  Oh, the garter, right? 
[00:32:00]  We're going to fish fight over that.  She's not going to throw the garter.  Why?  Because she thinks that's bullshit.  She's wrong.  What if I catch the garter and I get to put it up Jess's leg?  We're not throwing the garter.  What the fuck?  Sorry, I'm going.  What, are you throwing an IUD?  You get to insert it?  Fight with my face?  Yeah, you jam it.  It winds up on your neck like a fucking Shakespeare shirt.  Like a dog that's chewing its ass after surgery. 
[00:32:30]  Big lampshade.  Although Troy, even though he's bringing his chick.  Oh, shit.  Troy.  Troy was specific.  We were hanging out on Sunday, and he was talking about how much fun he is going to have.  And he was asking me the same questions about single girls that you were asking me.  Fucking, there's no competing with Troy Kwan.  You can't compete with him and his chick.  Both of them.  What a loaded fucking dick bag.  So they're going to be looking, and so.  Oh, so the pickings are going to be fucking slim.  I got to take his fucking scraps like a fucking jackal. 
[00:33:00]  We know where the Brazilian's going.  Yeah.  She'll be home with fucking.  You think so?  Yeah.  Troy.  They love it.  Yeah.  Oh, she has an accent.  Oh.  No, no accent.  No, whatever.  She's from the States.  The Papi, they speak Portuguese.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, por favor.  That's right.  Por favor.  Oh, okay.  Sorry, I didn't know.  She's born and raised in the States.  What else?  All right, let's go down the fucking ladder a little bit then, because we know Troy Kwan's  there.  What do you think I might have a fucking shot with? 
[00:33:30]  Well, I mean, you...  Mmm.  Mmm.  Someone else in the bridal party?  Yeah.  She good?  Who else is in the bridal party?  You got any real good white trash?  Yeah.  Toddlers.  Ha ha.  What about the ring girl or the flower girl?  Or the ring boy?  I don't care.  Whatever.  Whatever works.  No, I don't know if there's any, like, white trash.  There's a couple girls that are writing, like, a relationship advice book, and I kind of... 
[00:34:00]  What the fuck is that?  But I kind of get the feeling that they're young enough that they, like, because they're  in their 20s, so they probably want to gain certain experiences to write about.  I'll give them something to write about.  Sure.  That's something you could use.  Fucking chlamydia.  Yeah.  How to take jizz in your hair at a wedding and act like you meant it to be there.  How to wear it properly.  How to suck a dick in the men's room while you hear the fucking music playing outside.  Wow.  And there's some girls who work here that are going.  Oh, who?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, who?  Like, Monica's going. 
[00:34:30]  Who's Monica?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What?  Monica.  She sat outside this place before.  She was...  She was one.  Joe DeRosa liked her, but she's not interested whatsoever.  Oh, right.  She's not interested in anyone in this room.  Well, we'll see.  We've never sat down in a social setting.  No, she's blown the whole show off.  Yeah, but she's going to be drinking.  No, you know what weddings are?  They're like...  It's like a whole other thing.  And you drink, you start talking.  It's not like work.  And you're stuck in the middle of nowhere.  Right.  Which makes it a little easier, too.  And if I could offer a fucking limo ride back to civilization, they're going to be fucking 
[00:35:00]  creaming over that.  Civilization with a jacuzzi.  That's true.  Exactly.  That's true.  And I could offer that, too, even though it's not my house.  Right.  I could say, look, would you like a ride back to a jacuzzi?  Not in a limo, because he'll fuck you in the limo.  Right.  I'll say, look, you could blow me in the car, and I'll drop you off, and then he can fuck  you in the jacuzzi.  And you can have two different infernarial diseases.  Why don't we have the wedding at Ant's house?  Oh, see?  You could have done that.  That would have been great.  How convenient would that have been?  That would have been cool and everything.  No.  That would have been fun, actually. 
[00:35:30]  It would have been nice.  I'd just come down the stairs all hungover halfway through the ceremony.  Yeah, there's guns all over.  Those are the party favors.  Yeah.  Everyone gets a gun on the way out.  Oh, that would have been a good nice centerpiece.  Just ammunition.  Nicole's going with her fiancÃ©, but we all know that's not going to stay together.  She likes the strange cock we heard.  Right.  She's been engaged for, what, five years now or something?  She's probably been.  A long time, right?  Yeah.  She's going to look at her fiancÃ© and go, this should be us tonight.  She agreed to buy her the first guy who fucking held her hair while she puked. 
[00:36:00]  I don't know for her.  Are you entering to WWE music?  I'm not entering.  Well, you've got to get to the front somehow.  No, I'm just going to walk up there.  All right.  I'm going to come in from the side.  Yeah, so music will play.  No entrance.  Let's do some entrance music.  But what about the...  Let's do it a little different.  No, no, not for the ceremony.  Maybe for the...  Oh, for the reception?  For the reception.  I'm in the side of the show.  What are you and the brand new Mrs. Roberts, what are you coming into?  I haven't decided yet, but I get to pick, so it's going to be something stupid. 
[00:36:30]  Ass man?  Oh, she's going to do it.  Because I'm an ass man!  Good idea.  Oh, it's great.  Oh, what a great idea.  Oh, yeah, here it is.  Yeah, I'm a ass man!  Oh, maybe I should do this.  Oh, that would be great.  Ladies and gentlemen, the brand new Mr. and Mrs. Roberts!  Let's give her a big hand!  She's all smiling and ass man's playing.  And you're just acting the song out on Jess, just shoving in her ass or something, I don't 
[00:37:00]  know, sticking.  This might be a great idea.  Yeah.  And her boss would be there like, what?  Everyone's clapping.  Yeah.  Yeah!  And they don't realize the song is going.  I'm an ass man!  I said, I'm an ass man!  But they don't be climbing because you would start them clapping.  Oh, I would say, come on, everybody!  Because he's an ass man.  Because at first they think it's, I got class man.  And then, no, they realize.  And it should have a comma.  I'm an ass man.  Or I'm an asshole.  Or I'm not a man. 
[00:37:30]  How about that?  Doesn't even rhyme with that.  Whatever.  It still works.  Did you invite Eastside Dave to ruin your wedding?  Not only is he invited, he's at your table.  I got a...  It was this.  I was looking at the way the tables are set up.  Yeah.  And there's going to be...  Actually, Eastside Dave makes weddings a lot.  Oh, hell yeah.  Because of the numbers.  Is he going to burn down your wedding like you burned down E-Roc's?  No, I think that people have more respect for my wedding than they did for E-Roc's.  That's a bold statement.  What happened? 
[00:38:00]  I guess people meaning Eastside Dave and Troy, primarily.  E-Roc, is it true that you were putting out fires from Eastside Dave at your own wedding?  Yes.  Okay.  At the very end.  I don't want to exaggerate anything.  He decided to put candles under the tablecloth.  Under the tablecloth.  I'm also not going to think it's a good idea to have the DJ play Guns and Roses and hand  Eastside Dave a microphone.  That's not happening.  Hand him a microphone and a candle.  That was a very bad idea.  That was bad.  This table am I at?  I was looking at the tables.  And there's going to be like two O&A tables.  All the hosts at one table.  I better be sitting with Jimmy Norton, too.  Right, of course.  So you three at one table. 
[00:38:30]  So where are they?  Me, Opie, Jimmy Norton, Eastside Dave McDonald.  Whatever fucking lucky piece of pussy I bring along.  And what about some fucking snatch?  And Kenny is the less.  That's up to you.  Is he going?  Yeah, he's going.  Oh, fucking yuck.  Can't give him his own table?  I want some prime slits.  Well, you tell me.  It was either E-Rock or Eastside Dave at your table.  That's what it was boiled down to.  Originally, E-Rock was at your table.  But why don't we have E-Rock and you put Kenny somewhere else?  Kenny's a bore.  You don't want Kenny at your table? 
[00:39:00]  He's a bore.  What is Kenny going to say?  You'd rather have E-Rock at your table than Kenny?  Kenny wouldn't even know he's at a wedding.  Well, E-Rock would be fun to, like, you know, goof on and stuff.  But that's why I put him at the table with Roland and Troy.  How uncomfortable will he be eating in front of us?  Wait, we don't get Troy at our table?  No.  I don't want to look at Troy at our table.  No, that's true.  Fucking Jimmy Dean over there with his fucking good hairdo and his fucking great arms.  Wait, I don't like his nice chest.  There's a table next to you.  I don't like this table thing.  Big cock.  Yeah, exactly.  Who wants to see him in his fucking skinny jeans and actually look good on him?  We're missing out on E-Rock and Troy and who else? 
[00:39:30]  You're at the A table.  Yeah, but those guys are all right, too.  Kenny will be funny, though.  Kenny will say something that just shouldn't be said at a wedding.  He won't know he's there.  He'll yell out during speeches.  Yeah.  Kenny's weird.  He was funny at your wedding.  I sat by him at your wedding.  He wasn't fun at my wedding.  I had fun with him.  He'll rub his head back like he does.  When he gets sweat on his head, he fucking takes a napkin and he rubs his head back.  It's fucking hard.  It's the way I would rub somebody else's head back.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just really an unpleasant movement.  I am just going to fucking tell that driver, leave the car running. 
[00:40:00]  I put the exhaust pipe in the window and fucking end this wedding properly with some Kool-Aid.  Be out in a minute.  There's one table with the air talent and one table with the staff.  Who's that?  And they're next to each other.  Talent.  Exactly.  I thought you meant four-hour time wasters.  You can shout if you want to interact with Troy so badly.  True.  You can just yell at the table next to you.  All right.  We're going to do that.  Yeah.  I want Troy at our table. 
[00:40:30]  No.  Yeah.  He's at the staff table.  He's sitting with Roland and Eric because they're going to make fun of Eric.  We don't get Roland either?  No.  How many people do you want at your table?  I'm glad about that.  I'm so tired of saying what?  What are you saying?  I don't understand.  Oh, this is ready.  What?  Can you make our table bigger?  No.  Come on.  Troy, Roland, and Eric are bros.  So they sit at one table.  They're going to be bro-ing down, jerking off each other.  You guys are bros, Frank?  Sure.  Yeah, they're bros. 
[00:41:00]  So they sit together.  Who else sit at their table?  Eastside Dave?  Oh, he's with us.  Eastside Dave's with us.  So there are others.  And then Monica.  And you know who's coming?  Stinky.  Stinky is coming.  Wow.  We don't get Stinky at our table?  I mean, unless you have to make the call right now, I will make the switch between Eastside  Dave and Stinky, but you make the call.  No, Eastside Dave's got to sit at our table.  Okay.  I got a phone call from Eastside Dave over the weekend.  He's very excited that me and him are going to be able to hang out and do some drinking  at your wedding.  I'll put you at the same table next to each other. 
[00:41:30]  I definitely want Eastside Dave right there.  How do you think he's going to ruin your wedding?  He will do something stupid.  He can't help himself.  He actually said he's not going to do anything stupid.  But that means he will.  Yeah, because, no, there's love between Eastside Dave.  How does it end?  He doesn't end it.  Taking his clothes off and dancing?  Yeah, but that's funny.  Like, that's not ruining anything.  Pinning a grandmother down to the floor and dry humping her.  Literally dry humping.  They have no moisture in their vaginas anymore.  If Dave took his clothes off and started dancing, I'd be fine with it. 
[00:42:00]  It's funny.  Yeah.  It is funny.  He's not planning on ruining your wedding, but you know he will do something stupid.  He can't help himself.  Well, also...  So what will that be?  Number one, I would have him escorted out of the vicinity.  Vicinity?  Yes.  Or facility?  Vicinity, facility, sure.  Wow.  No, he's not going to...  I don't think he's going to ruin it.  He might do something stupid, but that's funny.  What do you tip a limo driver to have him wait for you?  Yeah.  Well, how long do you have him wait for?  His tip could be he doesn't have to come in.  That's true. 
[00:42:30]  It's going to be great.  You should do a helicopter.  That would be cool, too.  Right across the town.  Imagine the pussy I could get with a helicopter.  You'll be there.  Yeah, we're just going to fucking chop her back in.  Are you bringing a girl?  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  That's a good question.  I don't know.  Because you got plus one.  I do have plus one.  I know.  If these guys don't use it...  I'll just grab somebody from the town.  Right.  I'll just go to the fucking local gin mill.  Pick up some fucking Connecticut skank.  Hey, whore, you want some wedding cake?  Okay.  Exactly.  Some blue-collar bitch. 
[00:43:00]  You'll end up leaving the girl that you came with and driving back in the limo with somebody.  Straight up at the Robert's wedding.  If these guys don't use their plus ones, can we move some of the guys over?  What?  I don't know.  Why not?  I'm not going to fuck him over that he's buying.  You're going plus one.  I'll go plus one.  But it could be anybody.  It could definitely be an expendable person.  That's fine, too.  Yeah, just dump them there.  Just dump them.  How about bringing fucking Big A?  Oh, my God.  A big A.  You have a plus one. 
[00:43:30]  I might bring Bobo to your wedding.  Oh, man.  All right.  I want to thank you for taking me to the wedding.  All right.  Go up there and walk up while they're talking.  I don't know if I should.  Oh, and he just won't.  Oh, imagine how embarrassing he'd be.  Go ahead, dumbbells.  Just walk up there and talk.  They want you to speak.  They want you to.  Sam said he wishes you would come up and talk during the ceremony.  I have two big guys at my wedding party, and one of them is back from Iraq, so I'm counting  on those people also acting as security. 
[00:44:00]  You know how quickly Bobo...  What was he doing in Iraq?  Probably worked at Abu Ghraib.  He was fucking helping Lindy England fucking open that guy's asshole to put the cape on  his head.  They'll be pointing at you and me.  They'll be trying to hook up electrodes to everyone's genitals, take pictures.  You know how quickly Bobo would be removed and tied up somewhere outside the venue?  Just being interrogated.  Yeah, he would not stay.  Wow.  So what are these tough guys?  Now we've got to deal with fucking tough guys.  No, they're not tough guys.  How could they be there in his wedding party? 
[00:44:30]  How tough can they be?  They're not tough at all, but if I was like, listen, if you need...  Could you get that retarded kid out of here?  They'd be like, yeah, we could do that.  They'd have to look around the room, yeah.  The entire staff would get booted.  Iraq's like, why'd they just throw me out?  Did you invite everyone from the show?  We're all invited, right?  Everybody got invited, yes.  Is everyone going?  No, Danny and Travis aren't going.  Why?  Oh.  I don't know.  Danny didn't get back to me.  I don't know why.  And Travis had, he told me he couldn't, he has another wedding or something.  Oh, does he?  Someone more important than you?  I think either it's more important than me or he told him ahead of time that he was going 
[00:45:00]  or it's closer.  God, I wish I had a closer wedding.  I don't remember.  I would go too.  Let's ask him.  Maybe I got to go to another wedding.  Closer geographically.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe I got to go.  Anybody's wedding.  Anybody.  I'll just crash one at the fucking Larkfield Manor.  I would fucking cancel this to watch a rerun of Luke and Laura's wedding on General  Hospital.  It's going to be a great time.  No, it's not.  It's not going to be a great time.  I bet you have a good time.  I suck.  If you let yourself have fun, you'll have fun.  Oh, is that it, Mr. Psychiatrist?  Yep.  I have to let myself have fun.  If you go in with an open mind, you'll have a good time. 
[00:45:30]  Go in with an open fly.  I'm in.  Yeah, pull your fucking cock out and stick it in everyone's asshole.  Oh, jeez, Chip.  Jesus Christ.  Fuck, sucker.  Idiots.  Fuck your wedding.  I'm going to fuck it up.  Chip.  You're not invited.  Whose table is Chip at?  He's not going.  I'm at the bridal parties.  Well, I'm going to fucking be telling jokes the whole fucking time.  Great.  I'll get some big laughs.  Are you going to cling the glass and do a toast?  Yeah.  I'll be like, God, put it where the shit comes out, Sammy. 
[00:46:00]  Fucking place to crack up.  Sammy.  Jesus.  Put it where the shit comes out.  What a great toast that is.  And there is a sort of, you know, people are doing toasts, and to be polite, you say, if  anybody would like to say anything, feel free, but nobody ever does.  Oh, boy.  But this may...  This could probably be a good one.  I'd like to say...  Oh, no.  Yeah, this is the best wedding I've been to in a long time.  You know, he was wearing condoms for a while. 
[00:46:30]  I couldn't understand.  Oh, how embarrassing.  I would always see him around my house when my mother's friends would come over to fix  the floor.  And I'll find someone who's black, and I'll go, they were men of color, like yourself,  sir.  Stanley T.  How uncomfortable would everybody be, like, that doesn't know the show or anything?  Jess's bosses and coworkers and all of our relatives would be sitting there, like,  what's happening?  Who is this guy?  My friends from home would be like...  She's such a beautiful girl.  Why is she with that man who's so nasty?  Why are we so far away from New York or something? 
[00:47:00]  We should have taken a plane trip or something.  Double gun, Sammy.  And I'll sit down.  Uncomfortable.  Oh, this is like low chatter.  Oh, I can't wait to fucking be chipping a toast.  You got Best Man, right?  He's going to do a toast.  Yeah, Best Man will do a toast, and then...  Just go over it with him?  No.  You say whatever he wants.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be one of those embarrassing ones.  You know, I remember... 
[00:47:30]  Oh, who cares?  There's a few words...  Go through a Sam Roberts retrospective.  There's a few words to describe him.  Calm goes.  Ah, get it?  That guy.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  Calm goes.  That's great.  Dick eater.  Dick eater.  Dick eater.  Dick eater.  That's wedding.  I think this wedding is going to be great.  Oh, yeah.  I think there's a lot of potential here for this.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Oh, yeah.  I can't wait.  The only thing that can make this wedding great would be the same way the Happy Land Disco is 
[00:48:00]  great.  Nice four-alarm fire.  All the eggs are blocked with cigarette machines.  I'd love to tip a Kent machine over.  And watch everyone inside be killed.  I can't.  Kent does 800-pound cigarette machines of old handles.  You can pull them to your conks.  Conk.  And the fucking VFW halls and Oaks Lodges.  I can't.  Stupid.  I found out last week the DJ is a big Jim Norton fan. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, great.  Have fun with that one, Jim.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, every two seconds he's going to be yapping about some fucking bitch.  Man, he'll just play music.  I like his family.  Like, why is there another Ozzy Osbourne song?  Crazy train.  He's going to look over.  He's going to look over.  He's going to look over to Jimmy right before he plays that Sabbath like this.  See what I'm doing for you.  It'll be weird.  All right.  We should take that, little girl.  Except he also, the guy said he wouldn't play the explicit version of Niggas in Paris.  Why?  He said that the venue would get mad at him. 
[00:49:00]  So?  Oh, Jesus.  Who cares?  You can do what you want, Scott.  Connecticut.  Yeah, you're paying for the venue.  There's none going to be around anyway.  Exactly.  Connecticut.  Just put it on.  A whole racist state.  Yeah.  Except for Hartford.  All right, listen.  We're going to break.  Bridgeport.  We're taking Friday off because you're taking Friday off, right?  Yeah.  I think it's a holiday weekend.  What the fuck?  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  We're giving them three days this week.  That's good enough.  That's good.  Yeah, be cool, man.  You march down that hall and go, you know what?  I feel like I have to take Friday off.  Yeah.  To get ready for my own wedding. 
[00:49:30]  And then guess what?  What?  Tomorrow we go, you know what?  I think we're all going to just take Friday off.  We all get some traveling.  Yep.  Got to get settled in.  Yeah.  This is going to work, man.  Okay.  I know what toast I'm going to do to crack everybody up.  Yeah.  I'm going to stand up there with a beverage.  I'm going to go, look out, teeth, mouth, lips, and gums.  Wait.  Past my lips and teeth and gums.  Look out, toilet bowl.  Here it comes.  That's a good one.  It's really good. 
[00:50:00]  I just got to remember my speech.  You're going to speak?  Well, not at the wedding.  My speech is going to be, take the throgs, neck.  It's quicker.  And speech is going to be, you know, when are we going to stand up as a race?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, you should come in full World War II Nazi regalia.  A dress uniform.  Yeah.  I think they would like that, right?  Oh, my God.  I want to buy fucking, like, under-all armor. 
[00:50:30]  I want to buy like white spandex pants  and take a Cialis and just have my  cock ridge in every wedding photo.  Cock ridge.  Who says cock ridge?  I want it to look like a little Vietnamese  hat in my undershorts.  I'm going to turn everybody in the family  on. Of course you are.  Sad part is half fucking Sam's family  would enjoy a lot of this dumb stuff.  It's a pervert.  Yeah, fucking weird.  Those are fuckheads.  We're going to take a break 
[00:51:00]  because we got to talk about the fucking guy eating the fucking guy's  face. There's plenty of fun stories  on the weekend. And the broad  fucking driving completely through a  house on Long Island. Long Island's great for that.  Billy Joel started that. I love this  broad. Great. We'll explain next.  Serious, serious  accents. The O.P. and Anthony  Show. 
[00:51:30]  Well, yeah.  So you've got to  let me know  Get in topical  with the 
[00:52:00]  sex man.  Does that bother him, you think?  When I don't get to the hook?  Does that bother you, Iraq?  He hates the hook.  It always just caught in his mouth.  That was a good one.  Thanks.  Because he likes hookers.  Oh, that's not good.  Why isn't Iraq as cocky  on this show as he is in the 10 o'clock  hour? I need to know that.  Oh, man, right?  He takes his little shots in the 10 o'clock  hour. He's all brave and shit.  What little shots?  He was doing it to your face last time.  Was he? 
[00:52:30]  I didn't even have him.  Because I didn't have headphones on.  He was talking. He was like,  oh, Opie's here.  He accused Opie of ruining  the 10 o'clock show.  It's ruined.  How could you ruin something that's already  so badly damaged?  It's true.  Just stomping on the rubble.  Why should I stay or should I go?  Or the Fred.  Oh, Fred Ruff.  It's Barney.  See, the clash.  Why the clash?  They released Combat Rock in 1982  on this date. 
[00:53:00]  Right back to his shitty fucking...  That's 30 years ago.  Who gives a turkey?  Travis and me gave him way more credit  than we should have.  Yeah, we thought he was talking about  Jay Leno ending his first stint  on The Tonight Show.  Yeah, man.  You could have won with a double.  He just went with an album being released.  Very literal.  Yeah.  What a crud.  Wait, Jay Leno left three years ago already?  I can't believe it.  2009.  Holy fuck.  What a crud indeed. 
[00:53:30]  What a fucking lazy job you did there.  How was E-Rock's Memorial Day weekend?  It was very good.  What'd you do?  I stayed at my house and I drank.  He had Eastside Dave over the house.  Wow, really?  Yeah, I heard that Eastside Dave was over there.  Why have I not been invited to this fucking humble abode?  Actually, none of us have.  He invited Dave before everyone.  We're going to have a housewarming soon.  When?  Hopefully it's a fire.  Probably the end of June.  Yeah, hopefully your housewarming 
[00:54:00]  is caused by an electrical outlet.  A faulty wire.  Faulty wiring.  So when's your fucking housewarming?  Yeah, what do you mean you were just sitting around  drinking with Eastside Dave?  It was fun.  Yeah, but none of us got invited.  Of course it's fun, but, you know.  What the fuck?  We don't know.  We're doing other things.  What was I doing?  I didn't have anything going on.  Me, Troy, and Roland went to Dinosaur Barbecue  because we had nothing going on.  What day?  Sunday.  Uptown in Harlem?  Yeah.  That's a scary little location right there. 
[00:54:30]  To go to the barbecue?  What time did you go?  We went at like 6.30?  I was readily available.  Nothing to do.  Next time we will invite you.  I wouldn't go.  Dinosaur Barbecue.  Yeah.  You just want to be invited.  Yeah.  What'd you guys eat?  Like, Brontosaurus Barbecue?  No, they don't barbecue dinosaurs.  You've never gone to Dinosaur Barbecue?  Never heard of the giant.  But none of us.  She had a good show, though, years ago.  Dinosaur.  Dinosaur.  Dinosaur.  Oh, my God.  How old are you?  Dinosaur joke.  Holy shit. 
[00:55:00]  Ah, shit, Jimmy.  But we didn't have any plans.  Like, I don't think anybody had any plans.  Yeah, I didn't have any plans, E-Rock.  We didn't get invited.  You were in Boston.  Oh.  That's just Opie, though.  Yeah, but I didn't get an official invite.  Why didn't you come to the house?  Yeah, I would have came home early for an E-Rock bash.  Troy and me were...  Troy and me and Roland were all talking about whether or not we should go to the house,  and we all figured that we didn't really get invited.  Get the fuck out of here.  What am I, a fucking party planner?  I have a party.  You show up.  That's how this shit works.  Your invites are a little vague, sir. 
[00:55:30]  You do right now.  They are a little vague.  You're not really sure which one you're actually invited to with you.  You sent me something last time, and you were like, hey, are you coming over?  And I was like, yeah, and then I came over.  How about an E-vite?  But then this time I knew I was having a party.  How about a nice E-vite where we could respond and stuff?  With E-vite reminders and everything?  There are people that need, like, invites.  Like, there are some listeners that are, you know, peripheral, shit like that.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  But you guys know, if I'm having a fucking party, you guys know you just come to the fucking house. 
[00:56:00]  But obviously something's going on if they're discussing it and they're not sure.  We wanted to go.  Because it's always fun.  We just weren't sure.  Oh, man.  You could have fucking definitely shown up.  Did you say, Sam, or what are you doing here?  Sam, what are you doing here?  What did he say?  I need to do to watch the fucking fish tank.  Oh, I see.  Make sure people don't tap on the glass.  Next time, all three of us are going to show up then.  Oh, man.  That would be nice.  You guys should definitely show up. 
[00:56:30]  It was, it was, it's not even an issue.  I went Saturday with Bobby to watch the UFC fight.  Yeah.  How was it?  It was phenomenal.  I watched it in a theater.  We were fucking laughing, jerking each other off.  Yeah, laughing and eating.  Well, yeah, we do that anyway.  King Velasquez basically destroyed him.  Destroyed Bigfoot.  And then fucking, of course, Dos Santos held onto the belt by kicking the shit out of Frank  Muir as we knew he would.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't get to see that.  Overeem fucking got, is out because of steroids.  Right.  So it was Frank Muir.  And now the next fight will hopefully be Velasquez and Dos Santos too. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  I can't wait for that one either.  I have never seen such a bloody fucking fight.  It was amazing.  Oh, it was great.  Blood pumping out of the guy's fucking skull.  That was a great night of fights.  I was out of my mind.  Yeah, it was a really good one.  The last few have been really good, man.  The last few pay-per-views have been really fucking good.  I'm spending half the summer away with fucking Sam.  We're doing Comic-Con and UFC back-to-back.  We are summering together.  We really are.  Oh, wow.  Like a couple of fucking, an alternative radio show.  We had to work for fucking, we had to work for the, what's the one around the corner? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, OutQ.  OutQ.  Yes.  Taking a trip to Vegas together and then, why not go to, what's it called?  We're summering in Vegas.  You know what happens in Vegas.  That's right.  And that's in California.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw a new video posted.  Oh, yeah.  New chippers and videos.  Oh.  I didn't see, I only saw one of them.  Yeah.  It was okay.  Are they on the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony?  Hopefully.  I don't, not yet.  They will be in a minute.  Oh, boy, yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, look.  He was too busy having parties I wasn't invited to.  Oh, man.  Sam was invited.  No.  Yes, you were.  No.  Your fiancee had told my wife that you had plans.  That's bullshit.  You had to do another radio show?  No.  Why didn't you take yesterday off or whatever day it was?  Sunday, maybe?  Because I'm taking next Sunday off.  I didn't want to take this Sunday off.  But everyone else took the fucking day.  I know.  I was literally, I walked into this place on Sunday.  I was the only person in here.  You should have stole shit.  You worked too hard. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, no.  Shit.  Sam, A, you worked too hard, and B, you're making us all look bad.  Yeah.  Stop.  And C, you're not even good.  He's just here a lot.  Like a fucking cobweb.  That's all it takes for this company to show up.  Don't you think it's a problem if you're the only person here?  No.  That there must be something wrong with you?  I don't think a lot of people around here actually have respect for getting better at  their craft.  True.  I do.  You guys do.  Most of the other shows around here are dog shit.  What shows are shitty?  Well, obviously the morning mashup. 
[00:59:00]  Mm-hmm.  We would all agree on that one.  Yeah.  I mean, listen.  Jenny Hutt.  Jenny Hutt.  She doesn't have an hour a day.  It is what it is.  Jenny Hutt.  Covino and Rich are good guys, but they do not put a lot of show prep into that show.  Oh, man.  Jenny Hutt wants so much attention that she's now tweeting pictures of her hot 18-year-old  niece and going, now, now, lay off.  Let's stop in your dirty thoughts.  Hey.  I want to see this girl.  I don't believe it.  Let's see. 
[00:59:30]  Let's take her to the fucking wedding.  She's...  Oh.  Want to go to a wedding?  This broad is twisted, man.  I like this Jenny Hutt.  She's a good egg.  What?  I don't believe it.  Let me see this bitch.  See, watch.  Read the actual tweet.  This one is...  If this doesn't scream attention.  My pre-teen at the end of her friend's bat mitzvah today delivering her gift.  Let me see the bitch.  That is a gift.  That's a pre-teen.  Oh, she's pre-teen?  It's Jenny Hutt's pre-teen daughter.  No, that's not the one I'm talking about. 
[01:00:00]  I don't want to pre-teen.  And they're all Jewish?  She's basically offering up her 18-year-old niece to get attention for herself.  Yes.  I respect that.  She's fucked up, man.  This broad is fucked up.  You know what they say about those Jewish girls?  What?  I don't know.  Something about blowjobs.  Oh.  They like giving them or something until they get married.  Long Island.  Something like that.  Long Island Jew broads.  Long Island Jew broads.  Especially.  Yeah.  Hey, when is she going to invite us to her huge, sprawling mansion with that Olympic-sized  pool that she...  Yeah, there you go. 
[01:00:30]  Whoa.  Well, well, now.  Well, well, well.  Look at the hell.  Looky, looky.  Oh, well.  Nice.  Oh, shish kebab.  Oh, shish kebab city.  Yeah.  What's the tweet, though?  My niece is 18.  Keep inappropriate thoughts to yourself, please.  Well, I'm sorry.  Too late.  Sam, thank you.  Why would you post that?  Why?  Unless you want attention.  I don't have any inappropriate thoughts.  I wouldn't mind a drop of the shit on my face.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's appropriate. 
[01:01:00]  I didn't mean to say drop of the shit.  That's appropriate.  That seems appropriate.  I would have a threesome with them, but I'd totally be tagging the fucking niece, and  I would save one little finger to just diddle Jenny Hut with, just going like, fleedle-leedle-leedle-leedle-leedle.  She'd get the one-finger wife diddle?  Yeah, yeah.  She'd get the one-finger wife diddle.  Like my fucking, my ring finger.  Not even like a strong one.  Oh, you wouldn't give her the thumb at least?  No, I would just give her some girth.  Fleedle-leedle-leedle-leedle-leedle.  And I'd be ravaging the fucking other girl. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, the 18-year-old.  Would you poke her shitter with your pinky at least?  Oh, fucking.  No, no, no.  No?  I don't get near fucking shitters after they-  Old Jewish ass?  They pet.  Oh, God.  Old Jew ass?  Just gefilte fish falling out of it.  Oh, jeez.  What about the 18-year-old's ass?  Oh, my face would be in there.  Yeah.  Playing like a trumpet.  Next time he talks to his broad, ask her why she's kind of basically pimping out her niece  for attention for herself.  I will do that.  And then she'd go, oh, Sam, stop.  No, I said no inappropriate comment. 
[01:02:00]  I was just posting a picture.  But why would you post?  No one knows this girl at all.  What the fuck?  She always has an ulterior motive.  Yes, she does.  When I fucking Twitter in her pictures.  Oh, you want me to bring her in?  Right.  Take your clothes off so I can get some air time.  Mimi Beardsley!  Oh, yes.  That was in my fucking head.  Mimi Beardsley!  Oh, Mimi Beardsley!  Why have we been on the air an hour and a half without hearing that fucking song?  Eat my ass!  Oh, Mimi Beardsley!  Could you eat my ass? 
[01:02:30]  Mimi Beardsley!  Haven't you done this before?  Mimi Beardsley!  Worst name ever!  Mimi Beardsley!  I love this.  Mimi Beardsley!  Are you fucking any Negroes?  Oh!  Do you have any friends who'll eat my ass?  Have some pool-legged alcohol!  Oh!  You're a virgin, aren't you?  Smell these poppers!  Her name is horrible. 
[01:03:00]  It's a real cock-sop now!  Why don't you take care of my baby?  Brother!  His cock went back into the left!  Back into the left!  His cock went back into the left!  Back into the left!  Oh!  Mimi Beardsley!  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley!  Haven't you done this before?  Mimi Beardsley!  Worst name ever!  Mimi Beardsley!  Mimi Beardsley!  Oh!  Mimi Beardsley! 
[01:03:30]  Oh, my dick smells like Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass, Mimi Beardsley?  Worst name ever, Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  So good.  That's a great song.  That song is so fucking good.  Drew Boogie is a fucking...  That, I tell you, the ones I listen to is that, and it's weird.  I don't even associate myself with that because of the way he did it.  I know, that's just it. 
[01:04:00]  And fucking...  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave, but I've heard that one.  The new one is Cry Your Tears Away.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Laugh Your Tears Away is a fucking great one, too.  Wait, how does that one go again?  It should be played already.  Yes.  Hold on, if Clumsy Hoops can hit the button.  Clumsy Hoops.  This one's fucking really good, too.  This is a good one.  I love a good Cranky Ant song.  I'm so angry. 
[01:04:30]  All my songs are very angry.  They're just yelling at people.  I know.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Fucking retard brain.  The insults are so childish.  Fucking retard brain.  What does that even mean?  Uh, duh, duh.  Cause I'm a retard.  Uh, duh.  Shut up. 
[01:05:00]  Brain damage, cunt.  Uh, duh, duh.  You fucking dummy.  Uh, duh.  You're not smart.  You're not funny.  You're not clever.  You're a retard.  Ha, ha, ha.  Fuck everybody.  I love when you fucking say, fuck you, you nosy body.  Thanks, Ant.  Aunt Anthony. 
[01:05:30]  Fucking Nana.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Fucking retard brain.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Take your medication.  Will you kill a child?  Will you kill a child?  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  Fuck.  Oh, that's the fucking, uh, short version?  That's the short version.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you are.  Fucking unshaven jizz bucket.  Hey, shut up.  You never gave us the hard, uh, the wrong one.  What's that?  Whoa! 
[01:06:00]  He never gave us the full version of it.  Whoa!  There was a shut up in there.  Whoa!  Shut up!  Whoa!  It should be in there.  Wow, Erock getting some balls.  Go to iTunes.  God damn it.  I wanted to hear that.  I know, the full version is so fucking good.  What was the line?  He didn't want us playing the full version, because people have been throwing him up on  YouTube and everything.  Oh, he's...  Oh, boy.  So, how did they get this album?  Uh, iTunes, right?  With us singing and talking over it?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:06:30]  Tell Rudy to shut up.  How about they support the Drew Boogie and spend a couple bucks?  I bought it.  Laugh Your Tears Away.  What was the line that I like so much?  Um, oh, yeah.  Fuck you, you nosy body.  You nosy body.  Nosey body.  Fuck you, you nosy body.  Oh, I am a tool.  But who says that in your nosy body?  Get your own fucking life.  Fuck you, you nosy body.  Take your medication before you kill a child.  That's the fucking best line on the record. 
[01:07:00]  That and then the, uh, you know, if you haven't seen CokeLogic's fucking, uh, bowling  for the A video, it's so goddamn good.  Is that all on our Facebook page, Erock?  Yes, it is.  People should just be like...  It's at the very top of the page.  Just like our Facebook page.  All this shit we talk about ends up there.  Yeah.  Like us.  Please.  Like.  Click the like.  Please.  Yeah, dancing guns are fucking great.  What, what, what, what.  How was the party at the compound?  It's, it was fucking just mayhem. 
[01:07:30]  Mayhem.  Um, debauchery.  Good.  Hijinks.  Nice.  Shenanigans.  Wow.  All four.  Yeah, yeah.  Damn.  They were just people.  I didn't even know fucking where they were in the house.  One of my screens came out of my window because some dummy tried hanging fucking clothes out  the window like it's fucking Mayberry.  Why?  I don't know.  I got a dryer.  I got a dryer.  And somebody was up in one of the rooms and tried to flip some clothes over the fucking,  um, uh, the bottom of the window.  Yeah.  And dry them that way.  And didn't know there was a screen there.  And it just fucking fell out of my window. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, was it a hotel this weekend?  Yeah, pretty much was.  Nice.  It pretty much was.  Or as my mother said, it sounds like a real flop house.  A flop house.  Yes.  I went downstairs, uh, after, uh, Sunday morning, Sunday afternoon, whatever the fuck  it was.  And, uh, the bar, it, it looked like every glass bottle and can had been taken and just  strewn about the bar.  And then somebody covered the entire thing with molasses.  That's what it seemed like. 
[01:08:30]  Wow.  Everything lifted up off the bar like this.  A lot of sugary drinks.  A lot of sugary sweetness and, uh.  Everyone needed their sweet and stuff.  It was, yeah.  With their drinks.  It was, they needed their sweet drinks.  And just cups and whatnot around the, the pool and jacuzzi and, uh.  I enjoy a sweet drink, so I shouldn't make fun of it.  It's crazy.  And then, um, uh, for some reason, my, uh, my air conditioning isn't working upstairs in  my house.  Oh, boy.  And it's two separate zones, and they both decide to not work. 
[01:09:00]  Who are you going to fire over that?  Well, I don't know, but I went up there.  You should fire somebody.  Sure.  I, here's, here's the new Anthony.  I went up there to take a look-see, because that was my line of work.  Right.  I, uh, unscrew the filter, a little hatch there, and I go to pull the filter out, and  I couldn't quite get a, a grasp on it, and it got very hot, so I just put the plate back  on and said, fuck this, and went downstairs.  After three minutes in the attic, I had had it.  You gave it a good three minutes, though.  I gave it three fucking minutes.  Nice.  I was done.  I got two AC units out. 
[01:09:30]  Really?  Yeah, they fucking go out.  Why do they go out on the hottest day of the year?  I think what happens-  That's the weirdest fucking thing.  He is, without a good, the filter's probably clogged.  Right.  Then the air doesn't blow over the coil.  Nice.  The coil freezes.  Okay.  And, uh, no air gets through it.  So what do I do?  So it just sits that way, you gotta change the filter out.  Oh boy, how do I do that?  I know, exactly.  They do that in my building for me.  They should do it for me.  Yeah, but they should do it for you.  My stupid building, I called downstairs, they're like, we're not changing filters or cleaning  out the filters till June.  What? 
[01:10:00]  You can get on the list.  I'm like, my apartment's 95 degrees.  Oh, man.  I need something now.  Yeah, fix that shit.  And we talked about this.  Me and Jimmy live in shitty New York City buildings where, and I say shitty because you have  to pay maintenance fees.  Mine is, uh, $2,500.  That's not toward the mortgage.  That's just $2,500.  You basically throw out the window every month so they can take care of shit.  So when you call them because your apartment's 95 degrees because, you know, maybe the filters  need cleaning.  Nope.  You gotta get on the list.  We start that in June.  That's what I was told yesterday.  I have to get an exterminator. 
[01:10:30]  What?  Uh-oh.  I saw.  Oh boy.  Walking from my bedroom.  No.  Uh-oh.  From your bedroom.  A fat pig?  Yeah, exactly.  With a cock?  Yes, but at least he was on time today.  I'm gonna go with a cockroach.  Uh-oh.  The fucking...  There's no way you have a mouse.  I saw a roach.  Oh no.  Roaches are...  The size of a fucking pterodactyl.  Wow.  It fucking looked at me and backed me off. 
[01:11:00]  Oh shit.  It was fucking walking from my bedroom.  It might have been a water bug.  Yeah, you tell yourself that.  It was massive.  Was it one of those silverfishers with all those legs?  No, no, no.  It was either a roach or a water bug.  Dude, man.  It was gigantic.  I'd rather see a mouse over a cockroach any day.  There's something about cockroaches that freak you the fuck out.  And they say if you got one...  I've heard that, but I don't feel freaked out by it because in New York...  What do you think they're hiding?  I don't think they are.  Behind your Aussie poster? 
[01:11:30]  My apartment's immaculate.  Immaculate.  Not if you have a cockroach.  That's like a neighbor or something.  It could have just been...  Or a water bug.  Yeah.  One could just walk in from the pipes.  A water bug?  Dude, a water bug's like a giant roach.  This thing was like...  How big?  It was probably almost the length of my pointer finger.  Jesus, that's big.  Jesus Christ.  It looked like a fucking...  Did it flitter?  Did it have fucking wings?  Yeah, does it fly?  It was reading off my Kindle.  I was so irritated.  I fucking freaked out.  We got bugs on the screen. 
[01:12:00]  Which one was it?  Oh, man.  It was...  Which one you got?  All right.  Sam the entomologist just pulled up some bugs.  Was that a roach carrying eggs?  What is that carrying eggs?  What is that?  You don't want that ever.  Old egg back.  Old egg back.  You don't want that.  No, I just had to...  I fucking hate when they carry eggs.  Yuck.  Oh, man.  That is disgusting.  Half these things look like old lady brooches.  Yeah, yeah.  I love this. 
[01:12:30]  I bought it off of the shopping network.  No, for me, it was a roach.  It was just a giant roach.  Yeah.  What bugs are you showing?  Yeah, man.  This is like from South America or something.  Show roaches.  That's not a New York City bug.  Go New York City water bug.  New York City water bug.  Or just go New York City bugs.  Yeah, because...  Yeah.  Okay, that's what it was.  New York City water bug.  Which one was it?  What is that right there?  Whatever...  Open it, Sam.  Click on it.  Is that it?  Yeah.  That was it?  Damn it.  God.  God.  I got the heebie knees.  Damn it. 
[01:13:00]  I think it was a water bug.  Water bug is a commonly used name for oriental and American cockroaches.  Oriental?  It's a giant roach.  Oh.  Yeah.  But water bugs are weird.  Like, when you see a water bug, that doesn't freak me out the way a teeny roach coming out  of my fucking kitchen would.  Yeah.  No, fuck that.  It might have come in under the door or through it.  Ugh.  It probably got a permission to enter and got my key.  Yeah.  It probably massaged me earlier in the day.  I didn't even realize it.  It might have came out of a vagina.  What is that?  You know that, right?  Oh, God.  It might have came out of that vagina.  No.  Yes. 
[01:13:30]  Dude, I fucking had a delivery that day of food.  It could have come on the bag.  What is that?  Cluster of them?  Yeah.  You got water bugs and look through the glass.  We got a water head.  He doesn't even know.  Doesn't even know what we're talking about.  A water head.  Is that dumb?  What's he doing in there?  Eating?  He doesn't know.  He's doing WrestleMania fan fiction.  I figured I'd just play the odds.  Let me see the egg back thing.  That makes me sick.  Oh, old egg back.  Fucking egg.  You think the people, like, fucking.  Imagine you see one of those walking around your apartment.  What do you do? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, look.  It's got, like, the eggs are, like, fucking little fingers on his back.  Eggie back.  Eggie back.  I fucking hate egg back bugs.  Asshole bug with egg back.  How could another bug fuck that thing with eggs on his back?  Don't break the eggs on my back.  My bug dick won't get hard.  Get rid of those eggs, stupid.  Long, thin finger eggs.  They're, like, giant, long finger eggs.  They are.  Those are nasty eggs.  Are those eggs? 
[01:14:30]  On his nasty back.  Yeah.  They gotta be.  Wow.  How do you know, Sam?  You're just saying yeah for no reason.  What else do you think they are?  His luggage?  What else could it be?  Well, that could be part of its back.  He could have the fucking toy.  Why are the eggs long?  Oh, they're long eggs back.  Maybe he has a fucking egg carton back.  Maybe they use them in sound studios.  Just.  Oh, my God.  Dead in the sound.  They just put a bunch of egg back bugs on the wall.  Oh, I don't like that.  That's gross.  I, entomologists are weird, dude.  Like, who would want to work with bugs?  Like, that thing you step on? 
[01:15:00]  I'd love to handle that all day.  That's a stupid job.  Predatory water bug.  Ew.  What's his back?  God, I hope you're infested.  I don't like those bugs with the eggs on their back at all.  No one does.  Even they don't like themselves.  I hate that.  They probably have a high suicide rate.  They're like the dentists of the bug world.  You think you're infested?  No.  I'm not.  No.  Because my apartment's too clean.  There's nothing for them to eat.  What are they going to eat?  My fucking, my UFC gloves?  There's nothing for them to eat.  If they, if I was infested, that thing just came in or came on something because my apartment's 
[01:15:30]  too clean to be fucking infested.  Yeah?  Oh, another egg-back douche.  Look at these.  Oh.  What's wrong with these things?  This is disgusting.  Why would you carry your eggs like that?  They're all exposed.  I hate that.  It's like having your balls on your head.  We kind of do have our balls exposed if you think about it.  Well, not like that.  Yeah, but at least we have legs.  Just hanging there looking all stupid.  Yeah, but that's the only, God just did that so they could get brushed when there's  a finger sliding down to the asshole.  You get the fucking, the gentlemanly ball brush. 
[01:16:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  Wow.  You got to take that, get that taken care of then, huh?  Would you bite into that thing?  No.  No.  Get fucking, get bug eggs in your mouth.  Oh, God.  Mouth full of fucking bug back all crunchy.  When are you, when are you going to get it like taken care of?  They're coming up today or whatever to make an appointment to do some fucking exterminating.  I probably don't even need it, but I'm going to do it anyway.  Just to be safe. 
[01:16:30]  I need some air conditioners.  How do I do this?  Hang on.  You got to get filters.  Maybe go with the filters first?  Yeah, I'm sure you just need some filters.  They're probably all clogged.  Oh, God.  Did you have any work done in there since you've moved?  Before, like, did you have filters put in?  I re-did my whole place.  Have you changed the filter since you re-did your place?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, man, because that'll fucking clog them up.  How long does the filter last?  If you're doing construction, you got to fucking change them right after you're done.  No, I mean, how long does the filter last just last? 
[01:17:00]  You change them every six months, optimally, but a lot of people go a year sometimes.  I might be a couple years behind then.  Yeah, I'll see.  What, I pull those things out somehow?  Yeah.  Underneath, maybe?  They're big units, like this big.  There's a little hatch.  Yeah.  I don't have a hatch.  Is it a window?  No, it's actually on the other side of the window.  You got to open the window and hang down.  Oh, it's a window unit type thing.  No, it's not a window unit.  It's like a wall unit.  It's something.  It's like a thing.  Yeah.  I know what it is.  It's like ball high.  They're in the front. 
[01:17:30]  And they're long, like this.  It's right in the front.  You pop that grill off.  And then pop out that thing.  Pop off that grill.  And do I wash it?  Yeah.  I don't know how to do it.  They make, they're doing it.  We have to be, I think they do it soon.  They come around and they just do the filters.  I got a video of a tranny streaking in Copley Square.  Everyone was thinking about you, Jimmy.  I know.  I heard.  I saw the video, but.  You didn't see no video.  I saw the picture.  I saw the picture.  I don't know where to fucking put this thing. 
[01:18:00]  Guy has a donger swinging in Copley Square.  What do I do with this?  Did you film all of it?  The swinging dick.  I didn't know.  Oh, my God.  I felt weird filming fucking.  Why?  Well, I got enough.  If you want to see his donger.  Of course I do.  Who wouldn't?  The best part of a naked tranny is the cock.  Please, Ant.  This looks like a guy, though.  Well, now it does.  He is a guy.  He ripped off his bra, his wig, his fucking girl shoes. 
[01:18:30]  He's a guy.  It's a guy.  You got to film this stuff.  It's a dude, man.  And he's laying down on the grass.  Completely nude.  You'll see his donger in a minute.  Let's hope so.  It's just in the middle of the fucking grass.  Copley Square.  That's kind of a busy area in Boston.  Has he laid down?  Yeah, okay.  He lays down.  Walking.  Yeah, he has a pretty big penis and an awful fucking...  He has a body like the tub lady in The Shining. 
[01:19:00]  He's all ball.  Jesus.  It's all hot, though.  That bag is probably just hanging down.  That was a hot bag.  Oh, dude.  You should have kept taping.  I know.  I didn't know what to do.  You have this.  You have a camera.  You have a camera.  I felt weird.  I don't want to film naked dudes.  But, dude, you'll spend 10 minutes filming Bobo.  You got to...  What's the matter with you?  I don't know.  What would you do on 9-11?  Point your camera down?  Oh, no.  I don't want to see this.  I didn't know what to fucking do.  Oh, my God.  And then he ran, and everyone started chasing him, and then the Boston Transit cops fucking 
[01:19:30]  tackled him and beat him up.  That's what you have to film.  Oh, I know.  You should have your camera confiscated for six months for that.  That's a terrible breach.  Well, I don't know.  The dude is running off with his dick flapping around.  Anyone running naked in public has lost their right to privacy.  The dick and balls swinging just didn't do it for me, I guess.  Well, it's not a sexual thing.  I figured I had enough.  You got to be like a journalist.  You got to be like a news guy.  I figured I had enough.  I don't know.  If it turned into a Benny Hill sketch, they all chase him, the fucking naked tranny. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  It didn't hurt you to go point to him.  Yes.  Hey, let's go.  They got the police.  Oh, look at his dick is flapping.  No, no.  I got enough.  I got him when he was over there on his cell phone.  I want to see the cops chasing the naked guy.  I was tired.  That's like me having my camera and seeing De Niro going, nah, fuck it.  Yeah, yeah, forget it.  I already know I blew it.  I just, I don't know.  I was just like tired.  But no one said you had to chase him.  I know.  That's what a camera's for.  I know.  And then he made it to the T station over there near Coppig Square and they got tackled. 
[01:20:30]  But he knocked a lady off a bike.  I know.  You never had all that.  Wow.  But it was hot and I didn't feel like chasing him.  That's the type of video, though, that people are like, holy shit, that's hilarious.  That's why you have Opie's eye.  No, but I was lazy and tired.  Oh, Opie's eye was sleepy.  I was very sleepy.  He had no front teeth either, man.  He must have had his teeth knocked out.  Oh.  I blew it.  Would you have walked away from the guy fucking eating the other guy's face? 
[01:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I usually do all right.  I fucking blew it.  I struck out on that one.  You panicked with like really weird things happening?  No, I didn't panic.  You panicked when the guy yelled.  You were yelling at the cabbie?  You should have kept that.  Which one?  I know you were yelling at some guy for an umbrella thing and fucking, he folded the  umbrellas up when it was raining.  Oh, I didn't have my camera that day.  You had something you were filming, though.  You were like, ah, you deleted it.  I know what you're talking about. 
[01:21:30]  You had something you deleted.  I yell a lot, so it does.  You should put that stuff up.  I do.  Oh, okay.  I do.  I'm trying to think of the one you're talking about.  I don't remember because I didn't see it, but you told me it was outside of where Barnes  and Noble used to be.  Oh, when we were all.  And some asshole was.  No.  It's a tiny little fucking park the size of this room with umbrellas, and it's one  of those summer rains where it's just pouring, and we're all under these umbrellas waiting  it out.  And if we ran across the street, we would have got soaked.  And this fucking asshole that works for the city, he's in charge of the umbrellas, and 
[01:22:00]  he fucking closes them all while we're still standing under them.  That guy.  What a douche.  What a cunt.  I did film that, but it didn't come out right, is what happened.  And then because it was raining literally like cats and dogs.  I couldn't fucking keep filming.  I would have ruined my camera.  That's what it was.  All right.  Now I know.  Yeah, but this fucking city douche.  I'm in charge of the umbrellas, so everyone's got to...  What good are umbrellas if you don't have them open during a rainstorm, you cunt?  Exactly. 
[01:22:30]  It's like having a camera when there's a naked tranny around and turning it off as they  want to get chased by the police.  The cops chase them.  I was so confused by what was going on.  I'm just like, what if I...  Sexually?  So confused.  I want to mock it and fuck it at the same time.  I didn't know what to do.  Oh, yeah.  I think I just panicked.  I don't know, man.  You're right.  I think I had enough footage.  It's still 40 seconds of nudity.  Oh, but the cops fucking... 
[01:23:00]  Oh, no, the cops were laying down and relaxing and walking to the camera.  Good thing you turned it off before the fucking chase ensued and the naked fruit was thrown  to the ground on the cement.  They're calling it Opie's Lazy Eye.  Now I can't post a video because now everyone's going to make fun.  No, no, no.  People want to see it.  No, no, no.  Because they're going to make fun.  I can't do that.  Now they want to see where it cuts off.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, good.  We get to see the Hindenburg throw the lines down.  That's good.  Shut the camera off. 
[01:23:30]  That's good.  One small step for...  Ah, they made it.  I want to save film.  Yeah, they made it.  Don't worry about it.  It was too hot.  Yeah, I know.  I hear you.  All right.  Looks like I was wanting to get in the car.  Turn it off.  Oh, look.  The president's coming.  Nah, the Stimmons freeway sign will be in the way.  Yeah, don't worry.  Put the thing down.  Put the camera down.  They're shooting.  I don't want to catch this.  It's Bruder.  Put that down.  It was too hot.  It's Bruder's all fucking Arab.  It was too hot to chase him.  I saw him.  I got enough.  How much footage of the president? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, I'm going to turn this camera off.  The car is turning down Elm now.  There's no reason to film this.  No reason to film the rest of it.  Oh, God.  I'm panicked.  What about the guy that ate the other guy's face?  I'm still trying to understand this story.  What a great story that is.  Where the fuck were they?  On an overpass?  An underpass?  No, they were on the side of a highway.  But if you could eat someone's face, why would you do it there?  Somehow they ended up there.  They were both naked.  But how do you end up there naked eating another guy's face?  I'm so confused.  I think they were homeless, and perhaps there was some kind of shelter, like an overpass near there. 
[01:24:30]  And they had a little tussle with each other.  Right.  And one naked guy started ripping the flesh off another guy's face and eating it and growling.  They said he was digesting it like he was swallowing big chunks.  Yeah, he was chewing it and eating it.  He ate 70% of the guy's face?  No.  Yeah, 75% of the guy's face.  75% of the guy's face.  And the cops told him to knock it off there. 
[01:25:00]  Stop that there.  Knock it off?  Hey, hey, knock it off.  They do knock it off, you crazy kids.  And then he didn't knock it off.  And one of the cops shot the guy.  Why do they have to shoot the guy?  Because he's endangering another guy's life.  I'm not saying I'm against that, but...  He was endangering somebody else's life right there.  Not really, if you're eating his face.  Yeah, I think it's pretty endangering.  How?  You're maiming the guy with your teeth.  That's a shootable offense.  Definitely, yeah, yeah.  Just for being naked on the highway, they should kill you.  Just shoot, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  So he didn't stop, and the guy shot him.  And he continued, after he was shot, to eat the guy's face.  So they unloaded on him.  I heard the bolts didn't have any effect at first.  Yeah, until they got the headshot.  That's how zombies work.  Oh.  You gotta shoot him in the head.  Are we talking about a zombie invasion?  Yes.  This is it.  This is the beginning of the zombie invasion.  What else?  The guy's fucking eating a man's flesh, and you shoot him.  It doesn't do anything.  And then you gotta get that headshot.  It's a zombie shit.  You're right.  It's a zombie. 
[01:26:00]  They're blaming it on that bath salt shit that's happening.  Yeah.  Calgon?  Yeah.  It might be a case that involved a new type of synthetic stimulant called bath salts or  plant food, which can cause users to become paranoid and aggressive.  They sell those things in, like, the bodegas.  What, the bath salts?  Yeah, they call it bath salts, and they call it plant food, but it's drugs.  What's plant food?  Actual plant food?  It's not plant food, but it's not.  Who figured out you'd get high from that shit?  But it's not really plant food. 
[01:26:30]  They're sold under the guise that, oh, this is a bath salt.  I don't get it.  Oh, this is a plant food.  But it's drugs.  What's the bath salt?  It's drugs.  Can you put it in your bathtub?  No.  It's not meant for that at all.  So why are they calling it bath salts?  So they could sell it.  Huh?  So they could sell it without getting in trouble.  You can't sell, like, hey, these are drugs.  Yeah, but it's got to be based on some kind of bath salt.  I don't think it is.  Really?  It makes you crazy as a fox.  Is it like that Sylvia or whatever it's called? 
[01:27:00]  Salvia?  Salvia, Sylvia.  I think it's Sylvia.  Yes, it turns you into an old Jewish woman.  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.  Oh, get my mumu.  I don't know what to do.  That's why they ran to Miami.  I feel comfortable here.  Sylvia.  Who's going to teach us about this shit?  I don't get it.  I'm not taking your word for this.  Where's Rogan when you need him?  He probably knows about this.  Yeah, Rogan would know.  He probably eats his stuff on a fucking plane.  He eats it.  Why would they name it bath salts?  So they could sell it.  But why they decide?  I think they just had to pick something.  It probably looks like it.  Oh.  And it could look like it, I guess. 
[01:27:30]  But it's under the guise that it's a bath salt.  What kind of drug is it?  I don't know.  Maybe it's African Yo-Himbi bark.  Is it based on another drug?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I need to know now.  It probably looks like a bath salt.  It's probably a meth or something.  It looks like a bath salt.  That's what I'm saying.  That's Jimson weed.  Jackie with the Jimson weed.  That's what I mean, though.  Is it like, what is it associated with?  Yeah.  What type of drug?  Maybe a little crystal meth or what? 
[01:28:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Something that makes you paranoid, apparently.  And hungry.  Yeah.  Starving for man face.  Meth?  Yeah.  It's a crystalline structure like meth or crack.  I bet you think they were fucking or doing something.  That's probably why.  Bath salts, because it kind of looks like, you know, crystals.  Why were they both naked?  They must have been lovers or something.  Oh, I'm sure.  It says one of the things with this drug is that it makes people's,  feels like their body temperature is just rising to crazy degrees,  so they end up taking all their clothes off. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, wow.  We should put it in the punch at the wedding.  How do we get some for the wedding?  Mrs. Roberts.  Both of them, by the way.  Wow.  Yeah, I've seen the pictures, by the way.  Thank you.  We've all seen the pictures at this point.  I haven't seen any pictures.  I've only seen a faraway shot.  Yeah, I've seen the faraway shot.  There's no close-ups.  I know, I think a guy.  Of the guy laying in the gutter shot,  and then the other guy, like, moving his legs.  I think we got a guy that might be, you know, Miami Popo. 
[01:29:00]  Let me see, Sam.  And what?  He sent pictures?  Oh, boy, did this guy send a picture.  Let me try to find it really fast.  You sure?  Because there's a few pictures of people with their faces ripped off  that might not be this guy.  No, this guy said you're welcome,  so I know he was taking care of us.  Wow.  As long as you say you're welcome,  I know that it's real shit.  Oh, boy.  What have we got here?  Yeah.  This is the day we ate the face.  The day we ate the face.  The drug is called methadrone. 
[01:29:30]  Methadrone?  Fuck, I can't find it.  Is that the picture I saw?  Oh, that does look like the picture.  Holy mother of fuck.  Naked black guy.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, the other guy's not naked.  No, the other guy's got a shirt on,  but I think he's naked below the waist.  Did the black guy rip his clothes off,  or is there a fucking...  His pants are right there, it looks like.  Oh, man.  So he got shot up good.  Did he just attack this guy?  I don't know.  I don't get why they were on the side of the road still. 
[01:30:00]  I'm obsessed with that part of the story.  I can't make it out the other guy's face.  Is it just his hair is covered in blood?  Yeah, he's laying on his side facing over.  Oh, because he must have been on his back,  and when he was eating his face,  it just bled out all over his head.  I wonder if the black guy took his clothes off,  or were they...  Because the guy's still wearing his shirt,  and his pants...  There's pants right there.  Whose pants are those?  Well, there's two...  He was protecting his balls.  Maybe.  You think the guy would have went for his balls  after he finished his face?  Oh, my God.  Right?  Hey, we got people that know about this thing. 
[01:30:30]  Might as well.  We got Doggy Daddy.  Doggy Daddy.  What's up?  Hey, Opie, Anthony, little Jimmy.  All right.  My sister's fiance last week,  I guess he was on those bath salts,  and Facebook on the computer was talking to him  and told him to go hang himself.  So what happened?  Oh, he hung himself.  Is he dead? 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yes, sir.  All right, listen.  You think that's the actual picture?  The article...  Shut up.  I'm not talking to you.  Oh, my God.  I just got a picture from the old Twitter.  Oh, that's so fucking disgusting.  You think that's the actual picture?  Let me see the hair.  Could very well be. 
[01:31:30]  Does that guy have a beard over there?  Man.  That looks like a beard, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you can't really tell.  They did say he was trying to gouge his eyes out,  and it looks like that eye is all fucked up.  Holy shit.  I'm looking at a picture that...  I'm not joking.  I'm starting to fucking dry.  I can't look at it.  Oh, that's so bad.  Hey, uh...  His right eye...  TJ Wells 13.  You get a big fucking Twitter plug today,  but are you fucking with us?  His right eye is still there.  You got your plug,  so tell me if you're fucking with us,  because we got a close-up.  I haven't seen this picture yet.  The worst part... 
[01:32:00]  His right eye is still looking.  The nose has been pretty much chewed off.  The left eye has been chewed out.  The whole face has been chewed out.  Oh, my God.  He almost puked.  And he still has a good mustache.  It looks like he bit the bridge of his nose,  just like you could see the teeth mark.  There's a giant gouge,  and he's got a fucking...  There's medical something taped around his face.  He looks silly.  Yeah, he looks like a silly goose.  Like, his teeth are in good shape,  trying to take lemons and make lemonade. 
[01:32:30]  TJ Wells 13.  Are you fucking with us?  Because you got your plug.  Now we need to know.  Did you just find a picture and tweet it?  No.  Or is that the actual guy?  I can't even look at that.  It looks like it.  Yeah, he's fucking...  What a terrible...  Holy fuck.  His face was chewed off by a man.  Go to TJ Wells 13  if you want to see a fucking gruesome picture.  That's a terrible picture.  It could just be from...  Where's he from? 
[01:33:00]  Because I haven't seen that picture anywhere.  That could be from anywhere.  That could be from a motorcycle accident  or a gunshot wound to his face.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, it could be one of those.  That's why I want to know  if this guy just went on the internet quick,  found a good picture that could be the guy.  Or it could be the guy.  Oh, that's probably what it looks like either way.  Or it could be him.  Yeah, true.  It could be him.  But that's a good representative  of what he probably looks like  after the guy was fucking snacking on his face.  But it looks like there's teeth marks  like on either side of his nose.  Like he took his nose and bit into it.  Where?  Like there and there.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Like you just like...  He was trying to pull his nose right off his face.  Trying to pull his nose off.  Yeah.  Do we care about the guy  who had someone, I don't know...  Teeth prints.  Hang himself?  Are we done with doggy daddy?  Well, it looks like he was...  Thanks, doggy daddy.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  That's fucking disgusting.  That's terrible.  Oh, that guy's so fucked.  We're going to learn about bath salts  from Greg in California.  Biting the eyes like that.  Greg in California.  Greg.  Yeah, good morning.  Hey, buddy.  What's this bath salt thing about?  It's just, you know,  what it's labeled as.  It's the new legal stimulant. 
[01:34:00]  I work in a rehab in California, so...  Proud of you.  Fuck you.  The client.  Might as well go to rehab.  How many times have you heard that dumb song?  Hilarious.  I know.  Trust me.  A lot of the kids try and get away with any drugs  that they can that won't show up.  It's a drug test,  but the thing with bath salts  is it always, always leads to paranoia  and about, I want to say, 
[01:34:30]  seven times out of ten,  we have to take them to psychiatric units  because they get so out of hand  and so crazy because of it.  How do you take the bath salts?  Like, how do you ingest them?  Well, there's two ways to take them.  You can freebase them  or you can actually shoot it up.  Ugh.  What is the drug based on, though?  What is it...  What family is it in?  The closest thing that I could relate it to  would be, like, a really bad methamphetamine. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like.  Oh, my goodness.  God.  That just makes you go crazy.  It totally makes you crazy.  So that means we're going to have people  fucking walking around in this state  trying to eat our faces now?  Nice.  How long does it last?  Holy fuck.  It could last a couple hours.  Like, it's a really, really bad...  Like, I'm not saying any drugs are good, obviously,  but this is good, man.  Some are good.  Some are good.  Yeah, penicillin, right?  Yeah.  That's a good drug.  That's a good drug.  That's a good drug.  You're right.  The thing that fixed polio. 
[01:35:30]  Headache, Tylenol.  Right?  That's probably a good one, too.  Valtrex.  Over-the-count Valtrex.  Some of my acid reflux...  AZT.  I like my acid reflux drugs.  Those are good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy's saying he found the picture on Reddit,  so this could be it.  He's, like, saying, yeah, it's going around.  It's the real deal.  Rated.  Thank you, TJ Wells 13.  Goddamn it.  All right, Greg.  Thanks for adding not much to the topic at hand. 
[01:36:00]  I wonder when the guy first realized that someone was eating his face.  I hope they were together and they were both high.  I hope that guy wasn't just walking down the street  when a naked black man just jumped on him  and started eating his fucking face.  Nah, there seems to be some kind of connection there.  I hope so, because I hope he didn't pull the guy's pants off  and try to eat his penis.  Oh.  Because there's pants laying there.  That guy was dressed, dude.  That's a random attack.  Nah.  You think?  No random attack.  I heard they were both homeless.  That's, like, the story I heard yesterday.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, it could have still been a random attack.  Yeah, true.  Let's say hi to Matt. 
[01:36:30]  He's a cop.  Treated yourselves to my face.  Oh, both homeless?  Yeah, they look like two homeless guys from Miami.  Matt in North Carolina.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  So, yeah, bath salt.  It's a synthetic, I don't know what, I can't pronounce the word.  It's too many letters, but it's a synthetic chemical compound.  Yeah.  And they used to sniff Miracle-Gro, actually,  and then they get derived from stuff like that.  Miracle-Gro?  Yeah.  What the fuck does that do to you?  I don't know. 
[01:37:00]  Who figured that out?  I don't know.  I tried putting my cock in it.  It always goes back there, doesn't it?  It's pretty funny, though.  It's not right.  Because we'd make your prick really fucking big.  Nice big fucking fat prick.  And a big flower comes out of the tip.  It looks silly.  Yuck, yeah.  Daisy coming out of your prick hole.  Why is your cock wearing a hat in 1930?  Hurricane Cummins, Sam.  It's going to ruin your wedding. 
[01:37:30]  No way, right?  Sorry to tell you.  Dangerous.  It's Burrell.  Burrell's going to ruin your fucking wedding.  Burrell?  They're saying it's going to hit the Jersey Shore.  Oh, good.  And then it pushes up, and there's going to be a lot of rain by...  By what day?  Yeah.  What day was it?  Saturday.  Okay.  It's going to be a lot of rain.  Into that fucking shithole in Connecticut.  We all have to go to.  Hope that fucking gazebo gets blown over so hard it takes a skull off.  Fucking decapitated by a gazebo.  That'd be embarrassing. 
[01:38:00]  There's just a reveler's head caught in it.  Everyone's running for cover.  While there's one concerned husband trying to get his wife's fucking torso and head out of the gazebo.  They're trapped in the gazebo in the ivy fucking wrap.  You don't think anyone else would help, huh?  No, we'd all run for cover.  His fucking head gets stuck in the lattice work.  Some fucking distant uncle is trying to get his awful wife's fucking head back with her body and dragging it out of the rain.  My wife's been decapitated.  Oh, man.  My wife's been decapitated. 
[01:38:30]  That would ruin it, right?  Would you stop the reception at that point, Sam?  We don't have to worry about it.  There's no gazebo in the race.  But I'm just asking, if someone is dragging there...  Oh, then I could go home, right?  If somebody was decapitated, yes, I would stop the reception.  Are you sure?  I would lie to the police and say, I didn't see anything.  I'd be huddled by the window rubbing my heart on somebody because everybody would be huddled  by the window watching this asshole like it's the Karate Kid 2 and fucking...  When Daniel does the fucking little kid rescue, we'd all be fucking standing at the window.  Oh, I hope he gets the head in.  I'd have my rod pressed against one of the bridesmaids. 
[01:39:00]  Well, can we ask Sam some questions?  I'd be on fucking 94 or 95.  Why would you just assume you would just stop the wedding at that point?  There's nothing you could do for anybody.  Because I wouldn't be in the mood to celebrate anymore, I don't think.  Why not?  One of my family members would be...  We all put our video cameras down, of course.  So we can catch the...  But listen, Sam, A, you paid for the wedding.  B, there's food and drinks.  Yeah, no.  Still, if there was enough wind and rain that it moved the gazebo to the point that it decapitated 
[01:39:30]  somebody, it probably would have affected the food and drinks.  Are we allowed to at least grab drinks and food as you're kicking us out of the place?  You can do whatever you want.  As the cops arrive?  Oh, man.  What a catastrophe.  I hope it's a sudden wind, too.  Like, it just gets blown so suddenly, your father's mustache hair gets straightened out  with a stupid walrus.  Look at him and his mustache is just drooping.  It's all down.  Yeah, it's over his lips.  Oh, man. 
[01:40:00]  I don't think you cancel.  No.  You keep it going.  If somebody was killed, I would cancel the reception, yes.  Depends on who, right?  You know how annoying that would be?  I canceled shows?  The fuck?  I know.  Well, I'm hoping that nobody gets decapitated.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're talking about decapitating.  That does fuck a wedding up.  Exactly.  I think.  I would think.  There's no doubt about it.  That the person ain't coming back.  So at that point, I think you continue with the wedding.  I really do.  I'm hoping for a Twilight Zone-like accident.  You might want to blow off the slow numbers and just go with the upbeat song for the rest 
[01:40:30]  of the wedding.  We don't have a gazebo.  No?  So do we find.  Corrugated tin?  Trees?  There are trees there.  With old limbs?  Oh, boy.  They're all brand new.  Podium?  Yeah.  Things are sharp.  You hear the crack of the fucking tree branch and you look up and all you see is some fucking  woman's feet sticking out from underneath it, crushed in the mud while her husband tries  to free her.  My God!  Somebody help me!  Yeah, our legs are flattened and worthless. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  If there were hurricane-like conditions...  What would you do in that case?  We'd probably move the ceremony indoors.  To Long Island?  What?  But...  To Long...  Yes, to Long Island.  What would you accept where you don't cancel the wedding?  Broken leg.  Broken leg.  Okay.  How about if somebody was caught molesting a child in the restroom?  Would that be grounds for canceling the rest of the reception?  What would happen if, like, one of your dad's co-workers was caught molesting a child in the restroom? 
[01:41:30]  I don't know why I think...  I mean...  It's a good question.  It's hilarious.  It would put such a...  It would put such a dark, awful cloud over your head.  We'd probably not try not to make it...  Police are there.  It's a really good question.  And he was doing, like, a real...  Like, a Penn State fucking thing, where it's thwocking.  Yeah, raping.  You're just hearing fucking thwock, thwock, thwock, thwock, thwock. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, it was a full-out sodomy.  It was a full-on...  Oh.  Everybody knew about it?  His little suit, pants pulled down around his ankles.  It's that little suit they wear.  Did you see?  Someone just saw two sneakers dangling with little Velcro straps.  Oh, and they heard, like, muffled cries.  Oh, my God.  And it turned out that it was a molesting happening. 
[01:42:30]  It was a big to-do at the wedding, and the police came and arrested the guy, and fucking  paramedics showed up.  Oh, man.  You would continue at the wedding at that point.  That's an obvious one.  That's an obvious one.  The father of the child is, like, trying to beat the guy off.  Yeah, but it's holding the guy back, ripping his suit.  Oh, man.  It's a big, ugly scene.  It's loud.  Everyone knows what happened.  Yeah.  But you can't really talk about it openly, because it's so uncomfortable.  We're all fucking...  We're all there watching it happen.  Jerking off.  Yeah.  The fucking wedding hall is, like, empty. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, I'd probably invite everybody to start the after-party early and leave the venue.  Yeah?  Also, we're not...  But at least you're not kicking us out and making us go home.  Well, you don't give...  Rooms and stuff.  You don't have to go home, but...  You should leave the venue.  But we'd probably leave the venue.  I think everyone would have to go to their rooms, but then we'd sneak food and drinks up  and maybe start a little party somewhere.  I guess.  If you really want to party.  Tangling.  Yeah.  With little Velcro strips.  We're not having any kids there.  At first, I didn't think there was a ventriloquist taking a shit. 
[01:43:30]  Jesus.  No kids.  How come the only thing your dummy says is, ow?  It's just horrible.  Oh, I'm crying.  Hello.  So bad. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, no.  No kids at the wedding.  Oh!  Oh!  Boom!  Sorry about that.  So we need another scenario, is what you're saying.  No kids.  Another horrific scenario.  Yeah, we need another scenario.  What if someone gets hit by lightning?  That could happen outside.  Wow.  Yeah, what do we do then?  During the ceremony.  They don't die instantly.  They just go to the hospital, right?  Right.  So as long as they're not dead, we could continue with the reception.  If somebody went to the hospital after getting struck by lightning, we could continue.  We would, right?  Yes.  Now, how about it hits a wire, overhead wire, and then a high voltage line falls on like 
[01:44:30]  half the wedding.  But it's people you don't necessarily like.  Yeah.  If half the wedding is dead, we'd probably cancel.  What about the other half, though?  Yeah, what if the cool people survived?  It was just a struggle of luck.  We could go and have drinks somewhere, then.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Nice.  And we keep our nice clothes on, though.  Somebody Twittered me something about the guy who was getting his face eaten. 
[01:45:00]  He said, it's Jim Pembrey.  Now talk to him, damn it.  It's Jim Pembrey.  Who's on the line?  What was that?  Hello?  It sounded like a jet plane.  This is Bobo.  Oh, Jesus.  What was that?  A jet airplane?  No, no, it was just a truck that passed by.  Oh, unfortunately, it passed by.  It passed by.  It passed over.  Who the fuck still takes phone calls from Bobo?  You?  No, who's putting him on the line?  Oh, we always have our phone screeners put him on hold, because we like to see how long 
[01:45:30]  he'll wait.  How long he'll wait.  Bobo was very angry, I guess.  When was that?  Thursday?  Thursday on the after show, yeah.  Very angry that, I guess, Big A was in here.  Yeah.  Performing, doing the news, and breathing on Iraq.  Yeah.  And Bobo got very upset and said he promised he was going to call Tuesday.  He said, I'm calling Tuesday.  All right, so you called Bobo.  Now what?  Now what?  Now what?  You got our attention.  Go.  Well, what it is is I got a plot to try to get the pets to take over Coney Island the 
[01:46:00]  entire day, June 28th.  This is a flash mob?  Ugh.  What are you talking about?  Bobo, you just want somebody to go to Coney Island with you.  What are you talking about?  What is this, Bobo?  Explain it.  We don't know what you're talking about.  Well, what I want to try to do is try to get the place crowded full of O&A fans and  try to get the whole Brooklyn Cyclones ballpark to go and then the night with that, the park  full of O&A fans.  To do what? 
[01:46:30]  Just jump in circles?  Yeah, what the f-  To make it an unofficial O&A night.  You're a blithering ass.  That plan stinks.  Oh, it's terrible.  What are you talking about?  I think we have some crazy stuff.  Who knows what'll happen?  I know.  It'll be you alone on Coney Island eating a dog.  Fucking hopefully being beaten up by the Furies.  Or fucking a stupid swan.  Is that a real gang?  The Furies?  Yeah, they were from the Wanderers. 
[01:47:00]  You know what I hope is happening?  I hope they're all O&A fans.  I hope they're all O&A fans and it's Riff beating you by the ocean with hockey sticks.  Riff!  So you want people to take over Coney Island?  Coney Island, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, do you think this could happen?  I think it could happen if everybody else shows up.  And then they show up and then what happens?  Well, the thing is, anything could happen.  He's right about that.  Oh, my God.  Quite literally, anything could happen. 
[01:47:30]  One of those possibilities is nothing.  Yeah.  It truly would be a boardwalk.  Why are we talking to this idiot?  I don't know.  He has nothing.  You idiot.  What do you...  You have nothing, Bobo.  Well, I'm hoping some crazy stuff happens.  I know.  You're hoping some crazy stuff happens.  Like someone eats your face.  Yeah, me.  I'm hoping something crazy happens right now.  Like we hear a screeching tires of a drunk driver and this phone call is over.  I hope you're in a fucking phone booth that gets crushed by a truck. 
[01:48:00]  Bobo, would you let someone eat your face to get back on the show?  Right.  I would, I would let someone try to do that.  Attempt it.  Attempt it.  He's already got a mangled dick.  Can't really fuck with the guy anymore.  How's Mr. Maloon against?  He's doing good.  What kind of dog is he?  How many times do I have to go through this? 
[01:48:30]  I have explained this.  I don't know.  What?  He's a snoodle.  He's a snoodle.  A snoodle.  He's got an idiot dog, too.  You're a schnithead.  Bobo, what the fuck?  I think you might have to retire from the radio show.  We were having such a great show.  We really were having a good show, Bobo.  You really don't have anything, Bobo.  You told everyone you were calling Tuesday.  Why did you tell me all these things?  You're like, no. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, jeez.  Babble, babble, babble.  Nothing, babble, nothing, nothing.  I meant to tell you guys, Bobo sent me a message on Facebook about coming back on the show.  Is there any day you wanted me to book him?  No.  No.  Okay, did you hear that, Bobo?  Did you hear them now say, Opie and Anthony have said they don't want you?  Yeah, we don't want you.  Officially, we don't have any bookings for you, Bobo.  That guy in Miami, technically, is he still allowed to go on Facebook? 
[01:49:30]  That guy in Miami, right?  Hey, we got Bobo later.  We got a wedding DJ, Eric.  Eric, what's up, buddy?  What's up, fellas?  Yeah, because we got some scenarios happening with Sam's wedding this Saturday.  Yeah.  And they seem a bit outrageous, but you're telling me you've seen some shit.  I've been doing it for 20 plus years.  I've actually seen two people die at events.  You hear this?  Yeah, I went to the grandfather of Bar Mitzvah Boy about 10 years ago. 
[01:50:00]  And you were talking about New Rochelle.  It was up there along the water in New Rochelle.  I don't care where the wedding was.  What I need to know is after the guy died, did the wedding or the Bar Mitzvah...  Stop, dude.  It was done.  Done.  Oh, that sucks.  What happened?  The ambulance came in and got him?  What happened?  They came in with the fucking...  With the gurney and they brought him out and everybody was like, we want to go home.  Yeah.  I think we should leave.  They moved everybody out of the main hall back into the cocktail hour area.  I stayed in there because my equipment was in there, but that's exactly what happened. 
[01:50:30]  If they moved you into the cocktail hour, are you going to the bar and getting a drink?  Absolutely.  Of course.  It was entertainment for me.  I had no horse in the race.  No horse in the race?  I don't get that, sir.  Stop making E-Rock jokes.  I'm surprised you're still a wedding DJ after 25 years with humor like that.  It should have been discovered by now.  What was the other scenario?  Oh, my God.  What was the other thing?  A mother and her sister-in-law actually coming up to blows like a big fist fight on the dance 
[01:51:00]  floor.  The party ended on that one, too.  I've heard of that, too.  My friend used to film weddings and he said he saw a fist fight between the groom and best  man during the ceremony.  Why would that end the wedding?  I don't know.  It got really out of hand.  That was on the bar mitzvah, actually.  It just got really out of hand.  They couldn't calm the two bitches down and they just...  Wow.  At a bar mitzvah?  At a bar mitzvah, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  What happened?  Some fucking...  They invited the German co-worker and words were exchanged. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Jimmy, what did the devil say to Hitler when he got to hell?  What did the devil say to Hitler when he...  Hold on a second.  Hey, welcome to hell or something with your mustache?  If I knew you're coming, I'd have baked you a kike.  Oh, punching out.  No, you don't punch out.  No, you don't punch out after you fell miserably.  Punching out is the ejection seat of the aircraft.  Yeah, you already hit the ground.  You can't punch out.  You hit the ground.  It's flames.  You're burnt to a crisp.  Mikey.  Hey, man.  What's...  Hi, Mike.  Hey. 
[01:52:00]  So, my cousin was marrying this guy during the Tarantella.  The guy's uncle just straight out drops dead on the floor.  Wheel him out of there.  They're doing CPR in the middle of the fucking dance floor.  So, they get him out of there.  I'd say about 20 minutes later, our family's fucking still partying on the dance floor while  everyone else is in the corner.  Brian.  Brian.  Yeah, you're going to lose half the place.  We understand that.  But you still...  Stop playing!  Oh, God. 
[01:52:30]  We all understand when you go to a wedding, you don't know half the people there.  So, if it's someone from their side dying...  Yeah.  You don't know those.  Who cares?  Holy...  More wine!  So, you guys continued partying.  Partying, drinking, and the depressing news was probably about an hour and a half later.  where the news got back from the hospital was that he was officially dead. 
[01:53:00]  Wow, that sucks.  No.  That's it.  My health doesn't allow it.  All right.  All right.  But at least you guys continued for a while.  That's right, man.  So, I wouldn't be the guy telling everyone that the guy that went to the hospital is dead.  Why don't you just save that news for the next day?  Save that news.  Right.  Oh, he's fine.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Sam, is this giving you a panic attack?  No.  You all right?  All right.  Brian, go ahead.  If somebody dies at the wedding, I'd probably call the wedding mom.  Jesus.  My brother's wedding before the wedding.  Pictures are being taken on the altar of a Catholic church.  My grandmother dies an hour before the wedding as people are lined up trying to get in.  Oh, man.  And we're all debating whether or not to go on with the wedding, which we did.  You have a two-for-one, like a funeral wedding thing.  How did she die?  To deal her in.  She was shot. 
[01:54:00]  By a crip member.  You know what?  I say you go on with the wedding.  It's what she would have wanted.  Oh, she would have wanted that, right?  She would have wanted that.  Probably not.  That's what we tried to say to my grandpa while we were partying at my dad's house during  the reception.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Just send him in the back of the ambulance.  Fucking, hey, you.  You can take all white stockings to the fucking cold room.  Get rid of him, too.  She died of autoerotic asphyxiated. 
[01:54:30]  She was choking herself with a fucking stocking while she shoved a cucumber in her cunt.  That's a hell of a way for grandma to go.  Grandma couldn't handle being on the altar that my mother's funeral was at two years  before that.  Oh, way to bum everyone out.  Listen, is that where you had your wedding?  Really?  We were having fun until you had to fucking bring that into the equation.  Wow.  That's just a bummer.  So your mom died and then your grandmommy died? 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Sorry to hear that.  So the funeral, grandmother was panicking because that's where the funeral was.  Yeah.  Why would you fucking have the wedding in the same place?  Ask my brother.  It's Catholic, you know?  It's the church.  You moved the buzzkill out of there?  The grandpa got him out of the situation, too?  Well, yeah, yeah.  He has to go to the hospital.  He's trying to have some laughs and he's like, boo!  It's all about me.  That's right.  Wow.  People partying in the backyard. 
[01:55:30]  Damn.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  I'm going to a paramedic, Mark in Philly.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hi, Mark.  I work rescue in Philadelphia, fire rescue.  I've had hundreds.  Congrats.  We do a radio show.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I've had hundreds of runs at weddings and different functions where people die.  I once had the bride drop dead on the altar at a wedding.  No.  We actually had to come in and attempt to resuscitate her.  She had a congenital heart disease nobody knew about. 
[01:56:00]  Genitals?  She was over dead.  Genitals on her heart?  Yeah.  That's a disease.  Oh, no.  Cunt heart gutter.  The absolute worst, which Anthony would love, is we go to these huge Baptist churches.  in North Philly.  There might be 3,000, 4,000 people there, and people fall over dead.  And while we're attempting to work on these people, the preacher will come over with a  microphone, and they have a band playing.  And he'll be asking us questions, like interviewing us, while we work on the people. 
[01:56:30]  Swear to God, you couldn't make this shit up.  I wouldn't try.  You should write a book.  I'd read it.  I'd read that shit.  Yep.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  More excitement.  Let's go to Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Hey, what's up?  Hi, Dilly.  Good morning.  So I was at a wedding where the groom died at the altar.  He had a massive coronary and croaked right over at the altar. 
[01:57:00]  How old was he?  That's what I do.  How old was he?  He was telling me in his 30s.  Wow.  Hey, Sam, what if everyone gets food poisoning at your wedding?  Oh, what about that?  Will you continue running to the bathroom shitting?  Yeah.  Everyone's just shitting.  I'm eating into buckets.  It's literally that type of food poisoning where you're going to see some shit and some  puke.  Yeah, puking at the tables and shitting.  What do you do at that point?  He saw Dave just rubbing it on his body.  Yeah, I'm probably keeping it going and see what Dave's going to do and just see if we  can get crazy.  Yeah.  So we would continue under that circumstance.  Just get crazy, you know? 
[01:57:30]  Nice.  I like that.  All right.  That's good.  It's just everyone's shitting.  The place smells like shit.  And vomit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  Just get nuts.  You know that this is more of a special day for Jess than it is you, right?  It's a special day for us.  Well.  But it is.  It's definitely Jess's.  The girl, her wedding.  Yeah, it's very special for Jess.  Yeah.  So you really can't fuck this up.  Or you fuck up like a memory, a huge memory in her life.  I'm not going to fuck it up.  Well, you forgot you fucking lost your vows in your stupid trapper keeper. 
[01:58:00]  How did you do that?  I lost a notebook.  I have a bunch of composition notebooks.  I lost one.  Composition notebooks.  And had all your notes in it.  Right.  I think if grandparents died at a wedding, you continue.  Sure.  I really do.  Yeah.  They would want it that way.  They've lived their lives.  But you don't have to be the asshole that tells everyone that person's dead.  Yeah.  Wheel them out the back fucking door and move on.  How about if your grandmother shits her pants?  Like, say she's sitting and she falls off the chair and shits her pants and just goes  into shock.  He definitely keeps... 
[01:58:30]  What if one duty falls out and rolls onto the dance floor?  Yeah, there's a little ball of Nana's shit.  Oh, my God.  Just one nugget.  Yeah, go grab it with the bottom of your umbrella.  Everyone's dancing around it, just missing it, like the diamond in Indiana Jones and the  Temple of Doom.  You're filming it secretly, hoping someone steps in it.  Oh, yeah.  You don't tell anyone.  No.  Mimi Beardsley!  I hope something like that happens.  That's your karma.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm not hoping for anything. 
[01:59:00]  I don't hope.  No, I'm hoping.  No, you just said it.  I'm hoping.  Don't pin me to what I said.  Well, you said it.  You said I hope.  I was kidding.  It's a joke.  No, but you've been taking...  That's what I hope.  For the show.  For the show.  You've been taking phone calls about it for 20 minutes and asking about it, so it's your  karma, too.  No.  Yeah, you're fucking around.  I want to make sure you know what you're...  No, no, no.  I want to make sure you're properly educating.  For the lovely Jess.  And I'm not hoping for nothing, but I hope everything goes wonderful.  If something does happen, we will certainly enjoy it, but we're not hoping for it.  See, and you just said you'll enjoy it. 
[01:59:30]  We'll see if you do.  We'll see what happens.  Well, it depends.  Yeah.  I bet she makes a damn good-looking bride, I bet, right?  Oh, man.  I bet she will.  She better not wear white, though.  White covered with a condom, maybe, because, you know.  She's lost weight.  What?  She didn't even need to lose weight, and she's lost weight.  Of course she didn't.  She did not need to lose weight.  No.  No, she did not.  No.  She's been exercising like crazy and dieting like crazy.  Yeah?  Yeah, she looks fantastic.  Bulimia?  Is she puking after eating?  No.  Is she drinking cherry Cokes to hide the vomit on her breath? 
[02:00:00]  What those dumb bulimics do?  I know.  I see you drinking cherry Coke.  I get it.  You just got back from the bathroom.  That's horrible.  Is that what they do?  Yes.  The rotting teeth, because they fucking vomit through them all the time.  And drink cherry Cokes.  Yes.  Could I offer money to be with her on your wedding night?  Yeah.  You could offer money.  It would more than likely be turned down.  What if it's a lot of money?  Well, how much are we talking?  Sam, we would pay for the honeymoon to Hawaii.  It would.  That's true.  What if I give you, like, ten grand to sleep with her? 
[02:00:30]  No.  That's not enough money.  I have to start low.  Ten grand?  I'm not for her just to pull my nipples while I jerk off.  Dude, ten grand is a free Hawaiian trip.  With somebody who Anthony just fucked.  So what?  What was that fucking movie about?  Indecent Proposal.  Yes.  It would be like Indecent Proposal, except, you know.  Except $10,000.  It's not a million dollars, it's $10,000.  And it's not Robert Redford, it's me.  Yeah, it's an ass proposal. 
[02:01:00]  What year was Indecent Proposal made?  That was a while ago.  Being a child of the 80s.  Early 90s?  Yeah, I would say 94.  So that's $94 million versus 2012 $10,000.  10 G's is a lot, dude.  10 G's.  I was still in high school when that movie came out.  No?  Yeah.  No.  Let's play Mimi Beardsley, take a break, and do some other shit.  Why don't we do that?  I'm going to take a piss.  Yeah, I got to piss too, actually.  My cock is actually, it's at the tip. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, God, I'm full right now.  Let's go.  All right?  All right.  I'm not all right.  Play the full version of you, Rocker.  I'll fucking bite your fucking face.  Oh, we'll know.  I'll look like I'm in bath salts.  But why wouldn't you ask Drew Boogie for a full version so we could promote this properly?  I did, and he only wanted to give me the short version.  Well, you tell him what we need.  Oh, Drew Boogie getting a big head all of a sudden with his remixes and shit.  Here's Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass? 
[02:02:00]  Mimi Beardsley.  Haven't you done this before?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Are you fucking heavy Negroes?  Oh.  Do you have any friends who'll eat my ass?  Have some pool-legged alcohol.  Oh.  You're a virgin object.  Smell these poppers.  Her name is horrible. 
[02:02:30]  That's a real cock softener.  Why don't you take care of my baby brother?  Oh, look.  His cock went back into the left.  Back into the left.  His cock went back into the left.  Back into the left.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Haven't you done this before?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, my dick smells like Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  I got a quick story.  You know how we were talking about those scenarios with Sam's wedding and stuff, and then you got the phone calls of people dying and stuff?  I forgot.  I had a situation in my own life.  A situation.  But I've blacked it out.  What happened?  I've blacked it out, I guess.  Well, I was graduating from Geneseo, that fine SUNY Institute.  Braggart.  Thank you, sir.  And my mom, my dad, and my sister came up from Long Island. 
[02:04:00]  So you're talking about 400 miles, maybe 350 miles.  Long ride, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm graduating.  They call my name.  I'm all happy in a big fucking stadium, whatever the fuck it was.  I don't even remember where it was.  I think, I'm trying to remember if it was outdoors or indoors.  I don't know.  So then after the graduation, I'm looking for my parents like everyone does, right?  And all of a sudden I see my mom and my sister.  I forgot about this.  Uh-oh.  And they're crying their eyes out.  Oh, they're happy. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, they're so fucking happy for me, man.  They're crying their eyes out.  They're, you know, they're, uh, their kid graduated college.  One of the first in my entire fucking family, extended family.  And all of a sudden I'm like, Hey, where's dad?  Oh, no.  They were crying because during the graduation, uh, my dad collapsed.  Oh, man.  They never saw me graduate because they were too busy dealing with the paramedics outside  the facility.  Wow.  I'm trying to remember where it was.  I don't remember.  Wow.  Because I literally have fucking blocked this thing out. 
[02:05:00]  Did you scream at them?  They're crying their eyes out.  They're like, Dad was rushed to the hospital.  He collapsed.  Oh, wow.  They're like, didn't you see the commotion in the back?  I'm like, no.  They're like, that was because your father dropped.  I was busy fucking graduating.  Exactly.  Oh, wow.  Turned out he had one of those, uh, what, what is it?  Uh, a folded intestine, that thing.  Oh, man.  And he ended up having like two or three feet of his intestine removed in the middle of nowhere  outside of Geneseo. 
[02:05:30]  Fuck.  And I, uh, and I don't remember if we, I, I, I, I know I didn't go to the hospital because  there was too much shit going on.  Shit going on.  But I think we, I think we still went out to dinner and kind of celebrate without him.  Man.  So I, I, I forgot.  Sam, I had a scenario.  My dad collapsed in my, uh, my college graduation.  I'm sorry to hear that.  And I forgot until, uh, this very moment.  You still celebrated though?  Yeah, I think we did.  I, I honestly don't remember exactly what.  Yeah, I probably wouldn't have.  It was a slight buzz kill, but I was also like, you know, kind of like, you know. 
[02:06:00]  Slight buzz kill.  You didn't hang out in the hospital?  Nah, nah, I don't think so.  I don't remember going there.  I probably would have gone in the hospital.  You would have?  Yeah.  But my dad was always collapsing.  That's not good.  It was the stress from my mom.  I finally figured out.  He had so many parts of his body removed.  At this point, it was like, oh, another procedure?  All right.  It'll be fine.  Yeah.  What did he have removed?  Go about your business.  Bladder, um, appendix, uh, two to three feet of his, uh, intestine, his colon scraped, 
[02:06:30]  his prostate scraped, heart valves replaced, arteries replaced.  Damn.  That's the stuff I know of that I remember.  Yeah.  He had a lot of scars on his belly.  His torso had a lot of scars.  Yeah.  I probably would have tried.  And, uh, that we were all fortunate to see every summer when he would take his shirt  off in the backyard.  Oh, nice.  Right.  Reminding us of what's going to happen to us when we get older.  Oh. 
[02:07:00]  What was, what happened to your graduation?  Like, what exactly was wrong?  I told you.  But what, what, what, what, what?  His intestine, uh, folded.  I don't know what the fucking name of it it's called.  It's called folded intestine syndrome.  Yeah.  But what is it from?  You don't know?  I think it's some kind of disease that happens to people.  Not like Crohn's.  When you eat, like, nuts or something.  That, that might be diverticulitis.  Yeah.  I think it's that thing.  Or associated with that thing.  So then they got to go in and remove some shit.  Yeah.  But it was at my graduation, Sam.  They came up to me, uh, crying. 
[02:07:30]  And I, I thought they were crying because they were happy for me.  And it was because my dad collapsed and they took him out.  Yeah.  I probably, I mean, I guess I didn't really think my graduation was a big deal, but I  probably would have skipped most of those festivities and hung out in the hospital.  You would have?  Yeah.  I didn't care about my graduation though.  That means your father's healthy.  My dad was so unhealthy.  We were just used to it.  You know how many times I spent time in a hospital room with my dad?  No.  And he was always jovial about it.  Always, always happy. 
[02:08:00]  Trying to make everybody at ease.  Telling jokes.  Telling some of them jokes.  Showing us his penis and where the catheter goes in.  Yeah.  The catheter.  No.  I see that.  My dad had a big piece.  Did he?  Jesus.  Man, he had a big hog, man.  How big?  I do all right, but his had more girth.  Are you jealous?  Jeez.  No, I'm not jealous to be honest with you, but he definitely had a bigger piece.  My word.  Good for him.  Good for your mom.  Yeah.  What are you implying?  They had sex.  Oh. 
[02:08:30]  They didn't have sex after their sixth kid was born.  Yeah, but they definitely had sex at least six times.  I would almost bet money on that.  Why?  I don't know.  I slept in separate beds most of my life.  Oh, like Lucy and Ricky.  Yeah, it was because of his snoring.  Oh.  So my mom says.  Maybe you think he just was like, eh.  He wanted a taste.  I was going to nap.  My dad definitely wanted a taste.  Yeah.  He wasn't getting a taste anymore.  Yeah.  Do you think he looked elsewhere?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I hope so. 
[02:09:00]  For his sake.  Yeah, if he wasn't getting a taste, I hope he was getting a taste somewhere else.  Was it Robert's house?  I don't know if he fucked my mom.  I don't think so.  Or what happened is he just sucked his dick in the car?  Oh, jeez.  Can you imagine that we're sort of, we're kind of related?  You're like my half-brother.  How great would that be?  I mean, no, it would be fun, but because of the context of how it happened.  Would you be bummed or would you be like, hey, that's kind of cool in a weird way?  No, I'd be bummed because of the context of what it would do to my parents in my eyes.  That your mom was cheating? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, that wouldn't be cool.  But then you're like, holy fuck, but me and Oprah are kind of related there.  Right.  That'd be kind of cool.  That would be cool.  How old's your dad?  He's in his, he might be 70.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  You don't know how old your dad is?  I'm not positive.  My dad would have been 82 this year.  See, I still know.  And he's been dead for a while.  Yeah, I think he's about, I think he's 70.  Oh.  70?  So what if he'd like, just fucking started hooking up with some, like, 20 year old chick?  Or boy.  Or boy. 
[02:10:00]  What if he started hanging out with a twink?  I'd be specifically more bummed out if it was a boy.  A twink, he's just hanging out.  A young blonde kid.  A young blonde kid.  Friendly, taking him everywhere.  Who was tight.  Sorry.  No, it was really, really tight ball-hugging jeans and it's just snotty to the family.  I just had the visual that every family functioned.  Oh.  Coming by with his new friend.  With his new friend.  Why do you have an assistant, Dad?  Oh, well, I'm very busy.  He takes care of it.  And, like, every time you kind of walk in on them and they were not expecting you, they 
[02:10:30]  move very quickly.  You don't see anything really, but they move very quickly and their hands go down.  You notice your father's shirt's always untucked in a weird way with, like, the zippers  open a little bit?  Oh, man.  My mom's just kind of generally annoyed at the whole thing.  She ignores it because it hurts too much?  Yeah, it just hurts too much.  Like, when he goes, we're going to go in the, I'm going to go in the study with Lance  for a little while.  What?  Lance?  And they go in the study for a little while and she just knows that he's jerking your  dad off. 
[02:11:00]  She hears little noises come from the, ugh.  Yeah, it comes in the car.  Like, she'll see, like, full loads in the wastebasket.  Full loads.  Full loads.  That's...  Not in a tissue or anything.  No.  Like, you know, Lance jerks him off over the wastebasket or he just jerks off looking at  Lance in Dan's shirtless.  Would you be upset?  Yep.  Yep.  The answer is yes.  Yeah.  If he was just standing there fucking tugging his pud while fucking Lance paraded around. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  That'd be pretty bad, right?  I'm just about certain I'd be, uh, yeah, upset.  Would you have a talk with him?  No.  Would you be like, Dad, what are you...  I mean, maybe.  I doubt it.  He would try to, like, make it cool and come behind and he looks like a girl from the  back.  Oh.  You know, different strokes for different folks.  Oh, yeah.  Something like that.  You know, Sam, you live a long time.  Yeah.  You want to experience everything.  It's just...  It fits so snug. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  It grips me like a glove, Sammy.  Sammy.  That's a conversation I would, uh, really try to avoid.  People are amazed that I forgot that memory.  But I, I do want to say, my dad was sick all the fucking time.  It was just accepted in our family.  And, you know, during that thing, that's pretty important, though, you know.  No, I, no, I don't think it was important that I graduated college, to be honest with you.  No?  Nope.  Not at all.  At the time, you must have thought it was important. 
[02:12:30]  No, not really.  In hindsight, it was a load of shit, right?  Well, I, yeah.  I mean, I went to, I knew I wanted to be on the radio or on the TV, so in that way, it  was important, but as far as the...  Coca-Cola shirt?  The Coca-Cola shirt?  Yeah.  It's a modeling?  But as far as, like, getting a degree from, um, Geneseo, I didn't really give a fuck about  that part of it.  Nah.  I have a degree.  But I learned my craft.  I have a degree in sociology.  Yeah, how's that working out for you?  I like sociology.  Coming in handy?  Just in case.  I'm going to be a sociologist if this thing doesn't work out.  Yeah?  That's the only other subject I liked. 
[02:13:00]  Sociology.  Yeah.  Yep.  What does that do?  I don't know.  I knew, though, when I was getting my degree in sociology, I was literally driving home  that day so I could be in here on Monday.  Because you knew.  This is where I was going to be.  What are you going to do with sociology?  You're just trying to get out of school.  Yeah.  What kind of jobs do you get with a sociology degree?  Oh, fuck, you could go to Africa and, like, study tribes and shit.  Oh, that's great.  You could be a social worker.  You don't have to go too far.  Social worker?  I wouldn't do that.  I would study shit. 
[02:13:30]  I would study people.  You'd have to find somebody to find your studies.  That's what I do.  I go to Central Park and I study people.  But you don't have any grants.  You just get a grant and just wing off to fucking Zimbabwe?  Right.  Yeah, how cool would that be?  Is that what you do?  I wouldn't do that.  Terrible.  I'm totally uninterested in it.  You were on it.  Really?  I love studying people.  Sociology's kind of cool.  I'll study people here.  I'm not going to Zimbabwe.  Well, that's because of your sociology fucking background, you dummy.  You're saying, I hope you studied anti-sociology.  Oh, you don't even know.  Sociology? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, I'm a sociologist by trade.  Nice.  Do you understand forgetting shit because it happens all the time or no?  I really did forget until just now.  Yeah, because it wasn't a big deal.  Dude, it was all the time.  Holy fuck.  It had to be the stress my mom put on him.  It had to be.  Did your dad have a lot of health issues?  Well, yeah, you know, he fucking smoked like a chimney from the time he was like 16 years old.  But actual health issues from that?  Terrible.  Oh, yeah.  He had like black lung. 
[02:14:30]  Emphysema?  He had hard fucking problems and, you know, he was just a, he didn't really take very good  care of himself over the years.  The funny thing is my dad ended up making it to 74.  I told all my friends growing up, my dad's going to die any day.  Oh, really?  I was convinced of it.  Yeah, he's always had a problem.  Always had something going on.  Horrible.  Jeez.  Now the show's just sad.  Aw.  Yeah.  Well, let's bring it back to Sam getting fucked over. 
[02:15:00]  Sam's father and the twink.  Terrible things to come.  That sounds like a great name for a sitcom.  Aw, they hate the twink.  That's a great name for a sitcom.  Sam's father and the twink.  He's always hovering behind him at the wedding.  Yeah.  He's my assistant.  Always going to the bathroom at the same time, too.  Just think of terrible things that could happen to me instead of have happened to you  and you'll feel much better.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  His father's making out with him.  How come your dummy only says, ow? 
[02:15:30]  You would catch him once, like, kissing.  And that's when you'd have to confront him and be like, dad.  Not in the house.  Everybody knows what you're doing.  What are you doing?  Mom's in the kitchen.  Yeah.  Mom's in the kitchen straddling in Knockwurst.  Knockwurst.  What the fuck?  Nice.  Twink.  Hey, can we talk about this drunk broad from Long Island?  Yeah, what's she, though?  Can we put the picture up on our Facebook page? 
[02:16:00]  Because this is a local story there, E-Rock.  We want to go local with this shit.  This bitch.  Who is this bitch?  I don't think she's a bitch.  Who is this bitch?  What the bitch do?  She just likes her alky haul.  Yeah.  Drunk Brooklyn woman crashes car through Long Island home.  Completely through the Long Island home, by the way.  Went right through the front and right out the back.  Oh, wow.  Huntington Station, right?  This is like, how close to FH Riley's?  Could someone figure this out?  South Down Road.  We know South Down Road.  Google map that shit.  I've heard of that.  I guess the residential area, obviously, there's a stop sign. 
[02:16:30]  And on the other side of the stop sign is this lady's long driveway.  It's obviously a T-stop.  Right.  You've got to either make a left or a right.  You can't go straight.  Her house is there.  She fucking kept going, because this driveway does look like an extension of the road.  Wow.  And they said she was fucking flying.  She's lucky to be alive.  And she went completely through the house and ended up in the backyard.  Fucking drunk.  They should let her go, though.  What? 
[02:17:00]  If you could survive something like that.  Oh.  She's pretty scratched up there in that picture.  And she looks hammered right there in the mugshot.  Look at her mugshot.  She's just like, well, it happens.  That's probably why she's alive.  She should be tense up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All loosey-goosey.  Drunks always survive wrecks that they kill everybody else.  Dude.  Yeah.  I'll bring it right back to myself again.  When I was living on that 25A, my dad ended up dying right in front of our house.  But we had fucking car accidents all the fucking time, because we lived on a weird turn. 
[02:17:30]  And there was one that hit our house going at least 80 miles an hour.  Hit the corner of the house.  Fucking.  We couldn't even get out of the front door, because it just slammed the foundation so hard.  Then it just barrel rolled along the side of the house.  Ended up in the backyard.  I swear to you, there was barely a piece of the car left.  Wow.  Really?  I mean, obviously, there were some big chunks of the car.  But where you actually sit as a passenger, that's what I'm talking about.  And this guy, we all woke up like, what the fuck? 
[02:18:00]  And here's this guy just wandering around in his yard, because he got thrown from the car.  It's pretty amazing.  Completely okay.  When that happens.  Completely okay.  It really is.  Hit so hard, there was a huge crack in the ceiling throughout the entire house.  Go with your point.  They always survive, because they're drunk.  Why is that?  Because you don't tense up?  I guess they relax, so they just, who knows?  Maybe part of the problem is people tense up and try to fight it, and you wind up stiffening up and breaking everything.  I mean, they die, too, sometimes, but they survive for some reason. 
[02:18:30]  A lot of times, they survive for whatever reason.  Yeah, they wind up killing other people.  But they were, yeah.  I told you the help me story, too, right?  In the middle of the night, one night, all of a sudden, we're all sleeping, and all of a sudden, we just hear, help me, help me, help me.  Oh, I wouldn't fucking go out.  I was too young.  My dad went out, and what he found was a car completely flipped over, so the guy can't get out of his car.  With a fucking power line across the bottom of the car.  Oh, man.  And my dad's being fucking Mr. Hero, dude, pulling this guy out of this fucking wreck. 
[02:19:00]  I'm not supposed to go near that.  And then the one across the street.  I'm telling you, I know of four or five accidents, and we lived in that house for a long time.  There was a huge tree across the street from my parents.  I don't think the tree is there anymore.  Huge chunk out of the fucking tree.  Forever.  Never knew the story.  And then finally got around, and we finally found out that it was a car accident, and it was either the fire department or the local police going to the scene of that accident. 
[02:19:30]  It was his son.  It was his son.  And that chunk was still out of that fucking tree.  Just creepy.  Boy, what a great stretch of fucking road.  Well, you know where I live.  Oh, yeah.  It was crazy.  They used to go in the woods.  I think I've told all this on the air before.  I apologize.  They used to go in the woods because it was like going down 25A, and then the drunks would go ride in the woods, and no one was bothered by that.  It's fine.  They're fucking themselves up, and they're not hitting any houses or other cars. 
[02:20:00]  They put a guardrail there because it was happening so much.  So these cars would hit the guardrail, bounce off, and guess what house was in its way?  They started fucking hitting the house.  Our house was the one.  Oof.  Yeah, that's a...  But anyway, this lady went right through the fucking house.  Huh?  Bad stretcher road.  Yeah, yeah.  So she goes through the house.  Sophia Anderson, 21.  She just gets out.  She from Brooklyn?  How was she doing?  Partying?  Huntington?  It says failed to turn left or right because that was her choices. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  And just kept driving right up the driveway and through the fucking house.  What about the people that lived there?  Were they home?  Uh, yeah.  She left a train of wreckage.  She smashed through missing the 90-year-old homeowner and caretaker.  Imagine you live to 90 and some 21-year-old broad takes you out.  In your house.  A drunken kid takes you out.  One place you feel like you're safe.  I'm safe here now.  You're scraping your fucking foot on a pet egg. 
[02:21:00]  Fucking fender winds up hitting you in the forehead.  Look at that hole.  It's right through.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  How close is that to F.H. Riley's?  I'm not sure.  Did we Google image?  Google map it yet?  I don't know what the full address is.  It's a shitty looking house anyway.  Fuck her.  That old bag in a dumb house.  Could probably smell like mothballs when she drove through.  How embarrassing if you're fucking, you're there, your wife's away, and you're watching 
[02:21:30]  gay porn, and someone crashes through and sees it on the way through, and they tell everyone.  You know what I saw before I exited out the back of their house?  I don't know what happened.  I was just really drunk, and then I saw a fist moving in gay porn, and then I saw a tree,  and I blacked out.  She looks like a goer, though, that one.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind fucking eating her ass.  Yeah.  Eat her fucking.  She probably shit herself, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:22:00]  That's funny.  You see gay porn as you're going through the house.  Yeah.  It's a great visual.  Well, I'm sure she'll have the legal ramifications.  Let's go home.  A few legal ramifications.  Oh, yeah?  Are we just, you know...  You want to go home?  We still have another hour.  Oh, an hour.  Are the bosses here?  I'm not sure.  Did everyone take this week off except for us?  No, not everybody.  Us idiots.  It wasn't Steve on vacation or something?  Well, it was last week.  It was last week. 
[02:22:30]  I'm sure he's back now, yeah.  Does Greenstein still work here?  I saw him last week.  How's he doing?  He's good.  He's doing good?  Yeah.  You haven't talked to him in a while?  No.  One since November, if you're asking for real.  Oh, I was watching a lot of the Memorial Day programming, which amounts to a lot of war movies.  Oh, yeah.  And what's his name?  That Dale Dye guy?  His name is Dale Dye.  He's in every war movie.  He's the gray-haired guy.  He usually plays a captain or above. 
[02:23:00]  I'm sure I know him.  He was in Platoon.  You just described a hundred actors.  Oh, yeah.  But this is that guy that's like...  Which guy?  Is he the one that said...  Which guy?  There will be a court-martial.  Yes, yes.  Can I see?  Yeah, yeah.  How do you spell his name?  Yeah, that guy.  Dale Dye.  Dale Dye.  D-Y-E.  Dale Dye.  Dale Family Cry.  He was in Band of Brothers and stuff.  He was in everything this weekend.  It's like whenever Memorial Day rolls around...  That guy?  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's in every war movie ever made. 
[02:23:30]  Fuck, I really don't know.  Well, past a certain point.  U2 will cease fire.  Yes.  U2 will cease fire.  Fingers.  Yeah.  Sergeant Barnes.  Sergeant Elias.  U2 will cease fire.  He's the guy.  Yeah.  Lovely fucking war.  Yeah.  Drop all remaining ordnance on my paws.  Yeah, he was in everything.  But I was also watching...  My paws.  On my paws.  I thought he said pod.  No, on his position.  Oh, position paws.  Yeah.  Oh, I know what he knows. 
[02:24:00]  All remaining.  Yeah.  Fucking flatten the joint.  I watched John Wayne in The Green Berets.  Nice.  This was made in 1968.  It was...  It was...  The green with envy.  No, Chip.  Always with envy.  It was in 68, so Vietnam was still going on.  And I guess they were trying to make a pro-Vietnam War movie.  You know, because I...  How do you do that?  I guess they thought about it like, all right, well, World War II, they made some, you know, 
[02:24:30]  even Korean War, I guess.  They made a few during the war to try, you know, rah-rah up the country and the troops  and everything.  So they tried doing this with Vietnam.  And in hindsight, it just is so ridiculous.  First of all, the Duke, much too old, just be trotting around patrols in the Nam.  Was he topless?  No, no.  Thank God.  A movie where he wasn't topless, showing off his non-existent muscles.  His physique.  His in-shape, out-of-shape guy body. 
[02:25:00]  I love that bit.  But he's just limping and shit.  He's just limping and he can't fucking move.  Right.  And then they have, like, the little kid.  What was his name?  Ham Chop or something.  I don't know.  Some little fucking Vietnamese kid.  He was supposed to be.  He was probably Japanese.  Right.  And he, at the end of the movie, John Wayne kind of tussles his hair and goes,  You're what this war's all about, kid.  And it's like, really?  I don't think it was.  I don't think that kid was what the war was all about. 
[02:25:30]  No, I don't think so either.  It was some commie fucking, some commie paranoia.  Does he look like a Green Beret?  No, he didn't look like a Green Beret.  But they gathered up every friggin' Asian actor in Hollywood.  Even Sulu was in it.  Oh, really?  Oh, my.  You do a good John Wayne, by the way.  He was, huh?  You do a good John Wayne.  The Duke.  Da-ha.  Ah-ha.  Ha-ha.  The Duke.  And it was just so, it was so badly done. 
[02:26:00]  And it's like, yeah, when we win this war, and they're talking like Sulu.  And he's like, I'm from Hanoi.  And when this war's over, I will return there.  He's like, no, I don't think you will.  Well, you're done.  This war's over, Johnny.  And they were like a bunch of booby traps.  And they had punji sticks.  You know, punji sticks.  Oh, yeah, sure.  The bamboo.  Yeah, yeah.  And they showed some of the ones that they had around the perimeter of their firebase.  And they go, yeah, we got some punji sticks here. 
[02:26:30]  Except we don't put on them what they do.  Because, you know, they rub shit on it.  But they wanted to seem like the American soldiers were more civilized than the horrid VC.  Who just seemed to be these faceless actors that would run out of the woods.  And I don't know where they filmed it.  I think it's Southern California.  Do they use Asians or do they use the white people?  Some of the guys were just white guys with black makeup on their face.  It's like they had, like, you know, the combat makeup on. 
[02:27:00]  And you could tell they weren't even Asian.  There was just these fat stuntmen that would come jumping out of the woods and swing swords at people.  That makes me terrible.  It was so badly done.  The old movies, that made me howl.  They would turn these people into Asians or try to.  Into Asians.  I guess they just didn't have enough Asia on.  What was this Quiet Man about?  My grandmother used to love that movie.  They used to really get her fucking juices going.  Well, that with the Duke was like an Irish guy.  He tried to play an Irish guy like this. 
[02:27:30]  It's like every voice he had was the same one.  He couldn't do an accent.  He really stunk, didn't he?  Who?  The Duke.  Look, the Duke was not a good actor.  He stunk.  Sorry.  Sorry, everyone that loves the Duke.  But the Duke wasn't very good.  Let me hear him talk.  He was just a cool guy.  Now he's supposed to be some Irish guy, I think.  In 1952, wow.  Where was this film?  He made movies forever ago.  Was this filmed in Ireland?  Well, you're going to turn this up. 
[02:28:00]  I'm just a guy from Ireland.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Top of the morning to you.  Ah, it's Innisfree, you want.  Be saving your breath, Mr. Maloney.  Let me direct the gentleman.  Haven't you know the way to Nakanor?  Nakanor, if he knew the way to Nakanor, would he be asking the way to Innisfree and adjust beyond?  There's many knows Nakanor that doesn't know Innisfree.  And if you take the time to study your country, it's me, Mr. Maloney.  Because he can't do the accent.  So they're covering it up.  They just didn't let him talk for the whole movie.  Yeah, they're covering it up. 
[02:28:30]  So they call it the quiet man.  He doesn't say anything.  Here we go.  Is it trout or salmon?  All I want is to get to Innisfree.  Ah, no, you're not.  Oh, my God.  That's his...  That's his...  Hey.  52.  Trout as long as you are.  What a horrible...  And salmon.  The last one I know is expecting Jonah to pop out of his mouth.  That's right.  Ah, Innisfree.  We bring you there, Mr. Maloney.  Ah, this potato blight is screwing with my family.  Wow.  Was he telling you about that trout?  If I say one more red pussy, I'm going to throw a rock through the window. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my God, over the other end of the corner.  The Duke.  And my sister's third young one is living in Innisfree, and she'd be only too happy for  to show you the role.  Will she suck my cock?  Yeah, the Duke's not very good.  The colors in the 50s were weird, though, in the movies.  Yeah, yeah.  They couldn't figure it out, really.  I like it, though.  It's nostalgic.  It's not very realistic, but... 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little more vibrant now.  Vibrant, yeah.  Yeah.  I want to do my John Wayne.  They're all talking a lot!  I don't go into...  Oh, Chip.  What's that?  Uh, U-Rock and Drex.  I would just say a picture.  Oh, it does look a little like the U-Rock.  U-Rock's Secret Life.  Duh.  Blah.  Blah.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, that was just a...  He was a...  Green Berets was pretty bad.  He was huge in Hollywood, though.  He was... 
[02:30:00]  One of the biggest ever.  He wasn't bad in the Westerns.  I'll give him that.  But, you know, when he's trying to do movies like...  Where he's just kind of the regular guy, not a cowboy.  You like the Westerns?  Yeah, I mean...  They went on forever.  The original, like, Rooster Cogburn and all that shit.  True Grit.  That was pretty good.  The average movie was, what, like, three hours back then?  No, they made a lot of 90-minute movies.  They weren't that long.  I don't think so. 
[02:30:30]  But the epics were the big ones.  Those were, like, the big-screen epics.  They did take forever.  Well, I like when he was, like, a guest star on I Love Lucy.  All these guys, when they guest starred on I Love Lucy, it's like,  Well, I hope you see my picture, and I hope you enjoy it.  They're always plugging their movies.  Right.  Yeah, Rio Bravo's opening Friday.  I hope you enjoy it.  So things haven't changed at all.  No.  Plug whores.  Plugmeisters.  Plug fucking whores.  Rio Bravo.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, that sucks.  Did you see that Men in Black 3?  No, I didn't see it yet.  What's this movie about?  I guess Will Smith.  Will Smith goes back in time and hangs out with the younger version.  Because, what, Tommy Lee Jones is too old to do his role?  When I first heard this, when I first heard it, I was like, Tommy Lee Jones can't.  He's in it for five minutes, and then they're like, they go back in time, so then it's a  younger Tommy Lee Jones, but Will Smith gets to stay the same.  Josh Brolin, who seems to do a very good fucking job. 
[02:31:30]  So, obviously, Tommy Lee Jones is too old, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Or, he wouldn't hold out for money.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  He's too old.  So, what do they do?  The first five minutes, maybe they come back and they have the first, the last five or so with them?  But, Josh Brolin does the younger version of Tommy Lee Jones, and he seems to do a good  job, you know, doing it.  I mean, they were in No Country for Old Men together, so I guess he knows his whole mannerisms  and stuff.  He did a pretty good goddamn job.  Right.  I like the men in black movies. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, call me silly.  Go ahead.  So, why don't you go for three?  Silly.  Damn it.  Why don't you do three, then?  Well, I never go to movies when they first come out.  I wait until I can see them in the comfort of my own home, so I don't have to deal with,  you know, people.  I heard Chernobyl Diaries is just a fucking bust.  A bomb?  It looked stupid.  It did look stupid?  Enough with your fucking shaky camera, Blair Witch-looking movies.  Paranormal Activity thing.  Where's the guy?  Paranormal Activity, right? 
[02:32:30]  Oren Pally is the guy who did Paranormal Activity.  Yeah, it's like, we get your gag.  We had that guy in.  No.  He's the...  We had one of those guys in, didn't we?  No, we had the guys who did Paranormal Activity 3, who did Catfish.  I don't mind the gimmick.  Right.  I don't mind the gimmick, you know, initially, but now it just seems like, ah, all right,  you've done every scenario.  If you're going to Chernobyl, look, there's no one there.  Right.  And it wasn't like a big fucking murder thing happened there.  What is it?  There's supposed to be radioactive mutant people?  That's right.  What is it? 
[02:33:00]  So why wouldn't they go somewhere else?  I don't know.  I guess they've done all the ghost things.  No, I mean, why wouldn't the zombie people go somewhere else?  They just hang around Chernobyl waiting for fucking people.  Waiting for someone to finally show up so they can eat them?  That's dumb.  Well, they're there, and they did some video shooting, and then I guess the van doesn't  start, and that's what happens, and then they have to spend time there.  And then, of course, they got the creepy child, and then they got this camera where it swings  over just in time to see something disappear real quick.  It's all been done.  Yeah.  It's like that mermaid special that was on fucking, uh... 
[02:33:30]  Oh, I saw you tweeting about that.  Oh, my God, that made me angry.  What?  This piece of shit fucking animal planet.  I thought that was like a legit channel.  They showed this mermaid special with the worst special effect mermaid monster.  It was supposed to be footage that was real, but just captured.  No way.  They didn't say that.  Yes, they fucking did.  Oh, Christ.  The animal planet sucks.  I could see them doing maybe a show about the history of the mermaid and why people thought  they were seeing mermaids and all that shit, but to actually make believe they had footage? 
[02:34:00]  Well, someone claims the alien autopsy.  That's just stupid.  Oh, that's just dumb.  The mermaid monster.  You should find it.  What was the mermaid all about?  Fucking guys at sea for too long, and they're starting to see shit?  Oh, they start seeing chicks.  What were they seeing?  Manatees?  Eh, there's all kinds of theories of what the fuck they were seeing.  Manatees aren't that far out in the ocean, right?  No, no.  Yeah, I don't think you see them.  I heard manatees over the years.  I went to SeaWorld, but manatees aren't in the middle of the ocean.  No, they're in the fucking room over there, not queuing up music. 
[02:34:30]  They're more in like the rivers and shit, aren't they?  Yeah, shit.  Well, they see a lot of them around Florida, around the shallow waters, and that's why they're  always getting hit by speedboats and whatnot.  But I think that's where the mermaid thing comes from.  Oh, no.  Manatees.  We need a marine biologist.  This mermaid special made me fucking angry.  Let me see the stupid footage.  Because they went over why people thought they were mermaids or how they could have actually  come to be, and they went down a pretty logical path. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  But this piece of fucking shit video with the mermaid monster, which cuts off suddenly.  Oh, the animal planet fucking stinks.  And it was bad CGI?  It stunk.  Yeah.  Does the animal planet eat balls?  Oh, and Sam.  Balls, ass.  What are you doing, Sam?  Look for mermaid monster.  Mermaid monster.  It's right there.  You can't put mermaid monster in the Google search.  Body found on beach. 
[02:35:30]  Mermaid.  Ass footage.  Okay, it's somebody just videoing the beach.  And dramatically doing a pan up.  Yeah, they're going up to the water.  Now somebody's running.  That's horrible acting.  They're running towards something.  It's something on the beach.  It looks like a big whale or something.  What is that?  A pile of seaweed.  That's what I see.  That's all I see is seaweed. 
[02:36:00]  See?  So where's the mermaid part?  Where's the mermaid?  They zoom in.  When?  Why don't they walk up to it?  They're making it, like, frustratingly vague because that's the way real footage is, I guess.  Oh, stop.  Oh, look.  The kid's going to have to poke the pile of leaves or whatever.  Oh, wait.  Opie's taping it.  It just shuts off.  All right.  Now I see some kind of, what, hand?  What is that?  Oh, it's moving?  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  I hate that.  It scared me.  Me too.  I got a little scared.  I got scared, too.  But it's fake.  Of course it's fake.  Believe in mermaids.  The fucking animal planet stinks.  Wait, that's obviously a scene from a dumb movie to me.  So what are they trying to say on Animal?  That that's actual footage.  No.  Come on.  Where it goes, turn up the volume real loud and listen and you'll see something in this  video.  And then you do it and it goes.  And you go, ah, you freak out. 
[02:37:00]  Why did the Department of Justice seize that website?  Because it stinks so bad?  I don't think they really did.  I bet that's how dumb I am.  I believed it.  Oh, Jimmy.  The government seized it because they don't want us to believe in the mermaids.  This domain has been seized by the Department of Justice.  I'm really angry right now.  It fucking stinks.  The animal.  Wait, so they play that as a real clip?  It's so obvious it's fake.  That's a gimmick.  Yeah.  They're terrible.  Is that a tie into a movie?  Right?  There's got to be a movie coming out.  It's a fucking...  No, don't play it again.  Oh, the monster jumped up.  The mermaid monster. 
[02:37:30]  I saw it.  It was clawing at the boy.  Thank God he's alive.  Fucking piece of shit.  The mermaid monster.  It doesn't look like Ariel and she's not singing wonderful little songs about hairbrushes.  Whoever said less is more wasn't talked to.  What happened after that clip, Jimmy?  Because I don't feel like watching that show.  Just more garbage scientist interviews.  What are they saying?  Did they look at that clip?  Yeah, they're like, this is the only footage and...  They did not do that.  What are they saying?  That there's some other footage that was taken from a Navy lab or something. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, it's just enraging.  What if you go to that?  What was it?  Mermaid Believe Mermaid?  That's it.  Oh, and the seizure.  The Department of Justice and Homeland Security seized the site.  Oh, boy.  But meanwhile, a mermaid has been discovered, but it makes it onto the fucking animal planet.  Oh, boy.  It's not headline news.  Wouldn't that be on CNN?  They stink.  You would think.  Fucking terrible network.  Hope I get a show there.  Unless the mermaid was a Republican, then it wouldn't be on CNN or MSNBC. 
[02:38:30]  CNN bias, right?  Yes.  Fuck that shit.  Yeah.  What's that fucking guy's name that screwed up over the weekend?  Chris Hayes.  Chris Hayes kind of danced around it, but he said, in essence, was saying that just because  a soldier dies, he doesn't feel comfortable using the word hero in every case, and that's 
[02:39:00]  pretty much what he said.  Was he saying dead soldiers or...  Yes, he was saying dead soldiers.  He was absolutely saying people that have been killed in combat aren't necessarily all soldiers.  He's uncomfortable with that word being, you know, thrown around like that.  But the truth of the matter is, anybody that puts on an American military uniform and goes  into a combat zone and gets killed, in my opinion, anyway, is a hero. 
[02:39:30]  You can't...  Just to put yourself in that situation puts you at that level.  I don't know.  I don't...  I didn't...  I hated what he said, and then I watched the clip.  And then it didn't bother me as much.  It just bugged me also that it was...  He picked...  You know what?  He has the right to say whatever the fuck he wants to say.  I agree with that.  Obviously.  But it's fucking Memorial Day weekend.  It's an insult to family members of soldiers that have been killed to have this fucking 
[02:40:00]  piece of shit, this done-nothing-in-his-whole-life douchebag.  Yeah, they're just kind of downplaying what these guys have done.  Can we see the clip, Sam?  He's a shithead.  They're grooming him to be the next, like, Rachel Maddow, by the way.  He looks just like that man, too.  I didn't think he was...  That old channel's a bunch of fucking cunts.  It wasn't as bad when I heard it, though.  When I saw the clip, it wasn't as bad.  He danced around it.  He was trying to not get in trouble.  I... 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  I don't like what he said.  I hate that he fucking, you know, once again, another apology.  You know, stand by what you said.  Is he apologizing or no?  He apologized immediately.  He apologized the next day, I think, yeah.  Because he wanted to save his job.  It's like, you know, I hate that he said it, but fuck, another guy that has to fucking  apologize.  I don't think...  He meant what he said that day.  I don't think anybody would have fired him.  It's a...  He meant...  It's a liberal talking about something.  You don't get fired for that.  No, someone got to him, though, because he meant what he said that day.  He probably didn't like...  He quickly turned it around. 
[02:41:00]  He probably didn't like the death threats he was probably getting.  But are you...  But let me ask you a question.  Probably.  I think anyone that puts on a uniform and goes to battle is brave.  Without a doubt, brave.  Yeah.  But are you a hero just because you do that?  I think you're...  When there have been soldiers...  And again, the majority of them are fucking...  Are good.  But there have been some that were bad.  Or there have been some that were incompetent.  Or some that were doing shit they shouldn't have been doing.  Um...  I just think if you're...  If you're in a combat zone and you get killed, just the fact that you're fucking there. 
[02:41:30]  What a set of balls.  Yeah, no shit.  You're gonna fucking stand there while shit's blowing up and being shot at?  I like to find a lot of guys...  I like to see this fucking cunt do that.  Definitely brave.  Fucking Chris Hayes.  I can't stand this motherfucker.  The annoying part was that he's just another douchey liberal in glasses giving a predictable point of view.  Can we see it?  Hear it?  I would love to hear it.  Yeah, let's hear this.  I'm thinking today.  I'm observing Memorial Day that will be happening tomorrow. 
[02:42:00]  And I just talked with Lieutenant Colonel Steve Burke, who was a casualty officer with the Marines and had to tell people.  And, um...  Back, sorry.  I think it's interesting because it is, I think, very difficult to talk about the war dead and the fallen  without invoking valor, without invoking the words heroes.  And why do I feel so comfortable about the word hero?  I feel uncomfortable about the word hero because it seems to me that it is so rhetorically proximate to justifications for more war. 
[02:42:30]  And I don't want to, obviously, desecrate or disrespect the memory of anyone that's fallen.  And, obviously, there are individual circumstances in which there is genuine and tremendous heroism.  You know, hail of gunfire and rescuing fellow soldiers and things like that.  But it seems to me that we marshal this word in a way that is problematic.  But maybe I'm wrong about that.  No, words take...  All right.  You know what?  Look, I don't care.  But he has the right to say it. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  I don't agree with him.  And I think it was very inappropriate of him to bring it up on Memorial Day weekend.  Maybe the time he wasn't smart.  But it's fucking with, you know, people that are very emotional about this, you know?  But I do think that he should not have to apologize for that at all.  Yeah, I don't either.  I don't think anyone should have to apologize for anything.  I don't like what he said at all.  He's got to write, but...  I watched this guy on the weekends because he drives me fucking nuts with his big words and his pompous fucking attitude.  But he's gonna...  I bet he got a lot of fucking death threats.  I bet people fucking were just bashing the shit out of him. 
[02:43:30]  And that's probably why he backpedaled on that.  Should he apologize, though, Ant?  I don't think anyone should apologize.  Once you say something, you've said it.  Apologies are bullshit.  Yeah, this is exactly what he believes.  You know what an apology is for?  An apology is to keep your chick from fucking ragging you after you have an argument.  You give in and apologize and hope it ends there.  And that's just as phony as every other apology that happens with news people or sports stars or anybody. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  But this is what he believes, so he should hang in there and take the heat.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Be honest.  Don't bail so quickly.  You know, because now you're just bullshitting everybody.  You believe this.  I think there's...  Fucking cough still.  You can tell that he's uncomfortable, by the way.  He's staring around a little bit.  I think there's levels of heroics.  I don't think you dub somebody a hero because they crossed some fucking imaginary line of heroics.  I think just putting yourself in harm's way for a greater cause than yourself is pretty fucking heroic. 
[02:44:30]  Willingly...  I also think if you're in that situation and then go above and beyond, I think that's also very heroic.  And, you know, I guess there's different levels of heroism.  I think willingly going into the military is pretty fucking heroic.  It's just...  Knowing that someday you might be out there fighting and shooting.  And I can't even imagine that.  I think that takes a heroic person. 
[02:45:00]  Somebody tweeted me, I served with loads of cowards and pieces of shit.  Most were there for the college money.  Right.  That's some guy who is in...  I think with this...  I agree with that, yeah.  What I agree with what this guy said, what I agree with is the way we throw a word around  and it just becomes the word you use...  Like racist?  No, but in a...  That's true, yeah.  That's very true.  Yeah.  But in a way, it's like when you make it almost look like he's saying it perpetuates 
[02:45:30]  more war.  I kind of understand what he's saying.  Like when the word hero is used for everyone involved, that almost inspires you to want  to do it, which maybe there's a good reason to do it and you should want to do it.  They're certainly all brave.  I would never say that anybody...  They have much bigger balls than Oliver have.  But I don't think his point is totally off.  Even though before I heard the clip, I was like, fuck this cocksucker.  But then I heard the clip and I was like, I don't like the way he just hens and haws  into it.  Say what you mean.  If you think that the word is overly used and should only apply to certain people on the 
[02:46:00]  battlefield who earn it, okay, then say that.  And maybe people will agree.  Maybe they will agree.  Well, we got a vet on the line.  Let's say hi to...  Veterinarian?  Jerry.  Hey, what's going on?  Hi, Jerry.  Veteran.  Yes, Jerry.  Look, man, people that are over there are heroes.  And I'm going to tell you why.  But when we're over there, we don't know what's going to happen minute to minute.  I mean, you know, you can step off the curve here and get hit by a bus. 
[02:46:30]  But out there, I mean, there's hostile intentions.  So when you're out there, I mean, you know, people that are out there are heroes, man.  I mean, because they use...  It's just like police officers and firemen, man.  They put their lives in danger in order to save what we have here.  That makes them a hero.  So...  Are we heroes for entertaining people every day?  Yes.  Absolutely.  I absolutely consider myself a hero.  Nice.  To all mankind.  Take that, Rodney B.  Take that.  I think a lot of people in the military certainly are. 
[02:47:00]  But there are some guys in the military that aren't good.  Just because they're in the military doesn't mean that they're automatically amazing or great.  Because that takes away...  To me, that takes away...  That's like saying if you're a piece of shit in the military, if you're Lindy England or any of those...  Like, then you're just...  She's certainly attractive.  I love her.  But then you're just as important as a guy who fucking...  Who runs out and pulls a fellow soldier off the...  Like, it's like, no.  Right. 
[02:47:30]  Well, how do you figure out which is which, then?  It's an individual thing, I think.  Right.  I mean, and I think that...  And who decides that?  I think that we...  Most people would be able...  Like, you as a soldier would look at...  I guarantee if you were just talking to other soldiers, you don't look at every soldier you've ever talked to as a hero.  That's true.  But he was talking specifically about the dead and the fallen.  Yeah, that's rough.  He wasn't talking about soldiers that are, you know, just, you know...  That's rough.  Being a douche, but I mean...  It's a very rough point to make. 
[02:48:00]  I got Greg on the line with Jerry.  Greg, what's your point on this whole thing?  Hey, okay.  My point is this.  Not everyone who is in the military is a hero simply because they're there.  I have had friends of mine who were sentenced to either jail or the military, their choice.  So they chose the military rather than jail.  That person's not a hero.  That person's making the choice of the lesser of two evils.  Right.  Like Jimmy said, some people signed up just to be in the reserves. 
[02:48:30]  They didn't want to go to war.  They wanted the money for school.  You're absolutely right.  Now, but hold on, hold on two seconds.  But now you take that same person and now they're killed in the line of duty, you know, fighting alongside the people that they're with.  How do you know they're fighting?  How do you know that person's not a coward hanging behind the wall going, oh, Jesus Christ, Jesus, just make it stop. 
[02:49:00]  All right, there's going to be exceptions.  I almost do.  All right, there's going to be exceptions.  You know what, dude, I'd almost give the benefit of the doubt.  I think I would rather, in all honesty, not to backtrack, but I would rather err on the side of calling that person a hero than to err on the side of not calling someone one, if that makes any sense.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I would give that saying there are heroes serving our country and that many of the people die are heroes, absolutely.  But I would not, I would absolutely not agree to say that every person serving in our military and every person that dies is a hero. 
[02:49:30]  No, no, no.  I don't know if anyone is saying that.  All right, hold on, hold on.  We've got the vet.  Jerry's still in line.  What do you think of that, Jerry?  Here's the thing.  If you're hiding behind a wall crying because you've got scuds coming in, you're in Saudi Arabia, you're in the rear echelon of every single thing, but there's a scud flying in and demolishing.  I mean, you may not have gotten hurt, and you may have cried while it was doing it, hiding behind a wall without a weapon, but no matter how you look at it, man, I mean, when you get back up, you're still a hero. 
[02:50:00]  You survived it.  That doesn't make you any less a hero because you're a survivor.  And on top of that, I can tell you for a fact that basic training and your individual training tend to make criminals â€“ everybody is made green at that point or blue for the Air Force or whatever you want to call it.  You become of a certain mind that, I mean, some civilians â€“ most civilians really don't understand. 
[02:50:30]  But, I mean, you're trained.  You look at the guys that you're with, and you know that they're there to keep you safe or die with you.  You know, here's what I'm trying to, like, convey with this whole fucking conversation.  If somebody is in the military and they die in the line of duty, I think it's a very heroic thing, regardless of how they got there, because the bottom line was they put on the uniform, they were there, and they were killed being a United States soldier. 
[02:51:00]  To me, I'm not saying everyone in the military is a hero, but I think if you end up dead, that's pretty fucking heroic that you put yourself in the situation where that could happen anyway.  You know, so you got killed.  What the fuck does it make you a hero then?  I think it's very â€“ again, I say it's extremely brave.  Right.  The bravery.  When you talk about Full Metal Jacket, things like that, we all know that there's â€“ 
[02:51:30]  I'm not talking movies.  I've talked to my uncle and my dad, who told me about people when they were in Vietnam who they wanted to kill.  What about those soldiers who are just dicks, who people end up killing while they're out there so they don't then kill them instead?  Well, there's going to be â€“ I know there's going to be exceptions.  I think being a hero like anything else, I think it's individual.  I mean, I think â€“ and again, I think in the military you have a much higher grouping of them.  Absolutely.  A much higher grouping of them because they're living under circumstances which I would never volunteer for, and they're doing things which I could never do, and they're making sacrifices that I could never conceive making. 
[02:52:00]  So you're going to find a tremendous amount of them there, but the way he said we just throw the word around, it almost takes away the specialness of it if you automatically blanket everybody.  Are you throwing a word around when you're talking to somebody that was killed, like going â€“ you know, defending their brothers on the line there? 
[02:52:30]  I mean, that's what we're talking about.  Not everyone in the military.  There are some severe scumbags there.  But I think if you're fucking killed, I think you've put yourself in a situation that you deserve to be called a hero.  If you're there, you're not sitting there in fucking Kansas running the motor pool, then why do they â€“ they give certain medals of valor.  They give, like, certain medals â€“ not necessarily the president pins on you, but they give you â€“ because there are things in the military that differentiate you â€“ that's the word â€“ from other troops and other soldiers. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, there's obviously â€“ even they look at it like that.  Like I said, I think there's levels of it.  And, you know, if you want to find another word for it, then we're just talking semantics.  Right.  But I honestly think that if you've put yourself in that situation where your life has been taken because you're an American soldier in a battle, it's crazy not to say that's not heroic. 
[02:53:30]  A lot of guys checking in.  I'm a vet, and we're all heroes.  I'm in active duty.  We are all heroes.  But by definition, you need to be injured.  I want to hear from a guy that was in, like, some kind of fucking firefights, saved a bunch of his buddies, got the hell out of there.  I want to know what his thought is on this word.  You know what I mean?  Well, you probably think, like, holy shit, I'm a fucking superhero. 
[02:54:00]  But is he frustrated that other people are kind of â€“  I would doubt it.  There's a mindset â€“  I'm asking.  I don't know.  There's a mindset with military people where it's, you know, obviously it's very brother-oriented.  And I don't think a lot of these people ever look at themselves as heroes.  I think they see a lot of heroes around them.  True.  And don't really pin that hero thing on themselves.  But they'll be called a hero by the people that served with him.  So, I don't know.  I just think this guy's fucking â€“ 
[02:54:30]  He's so calculating, too.  He's very fucking calculating.  If anyone watched that channel, it would be a shame.  But thank God no one's really watching.  Yeah, the timing â€“  I'll say the timing did suck.  Timing sucked.  The timing did suck.  He's just a dick.  Like I said, though, he has a right to say it.  I got no fucking qualms.  I don't think he should be fired.  And I don't think he should have apologized.  But I just think he's an asshole.  Yeah, that really is like if you're covering a rape trial and you say, like, you know,  there are men that are falsely accused.  Because some women, even though there are â€“ 
[02:55:00]  it's like we â€“  even though I don't 100% disagree with them at all,  maybe the timing of it was kind of shitty and snide.  The timing of it does seem a bit snide.  Of course.  And, you know, maybe not on Rape Week.  You know, whether you recognize victims of rape,  you don't go off about how some women fake it.  Like, here's an example.  On Black History Month, I guarantee you this fucking guy would not come out and go,  you know, there are a lot of blacks that have done things to hurt this country.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:55:30]  And have done a lot of damage.  Oh, you'd never fucking hear that.  He wouldn't make that fucking â€“ that little asterisk of a point.  And it's MSNBC, so you wouldn't even hear that on any other month either.  No, but you know what I mean.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Let's go to Bill.  He's a 22-year vet.  Bill, what's up, buddy?  Hello, guys.  Listen, I did 22 years in the Army.  I don't consider myself â€“  And you're 17 years doing radio.  Okay, Ron.  I love Ronnie.  Yes, sir.  I don't consider myself a hero at all. 
[02:56:00]  But I will tell you, that guy that called that was complaining about, you know,  a judge sentencing the kid to go to the Army or go to jail is full of shit.  The Army is not like that anymore.  It's not been like that since the year.  It is a very elite group.  It takes a lot to qualify to get into the Army.  You can be a bonehead and join the Army.  Or join any branch of the service, for that matter.  Yeah.  I mean, I spent 12 years on the bag recruiting people. 
[02:56:30]  That was Jimmy.  I spent more time trying to get kids qualified to get into the military than I did processing them.  Yeah.  Open speeding tickets will keep you out of the military.  A felony will absolutely keep you out of the military.  No waivers considered.  Yeah, what the fuck is it?  The Dirty Dozen? 
[02:57:00]  Come on now.  Let's be real.  What about inner city Utes?  Oh.  Like from Detroit.  And they leave that situation and they go overseas to fight.  Is that a hero or a coward that he left the inner city of Detroit?  Yeah, being a hero is staying there.  Holy shit.  That's what I'm saying.  It's crazy.  All right, whatever.  I'm what a fucking idiot I am.  Bill, thank you, sir.  This is one of those discussions that are very, very tricky. 
[02:57:30]  And you'll get people on both sides.  I got to piss.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Really?  What's that about?  Tie that fucking dick in a knot.  Should we all take a break?  I'll just tuck it back and shove it up my asshole with a stick.  Why don't we?  And then we'll come back.  Jesus, I hurt that that bombed.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  And now, more unnecessary cruelty. 
[02:58:00]  Go fuck yourself.  With Jim Norton from The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, let me go to Jeff in Columbus.  Jeff.  Hey, you boys.  Love the show.  That's what they do.  Right with the fucking...  Dude, how many times do we have to hear that?  For real?  Okay.  Go ahead.  What?  I was wondering if the guy had enough whips about him to hit the General E-Horn before  he hit the concrete support show.  This is why we hate the fucking callers, man.  It's like one fucking bad joke after another.  Hey, Bob Kelly. 
[02:58:30]  Why don't you get some cancer and die?  Dude, it's me you're talking to.  And don't try to incorporate the fucking lingo of the show.  It's annoying.  Hey, did you wake up on the wrong side of the fact that you did?  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  I'm just sick and tired of guys like you wrecking the fucking show.  We got a flow going.  Why'd you put me through?  I didn't put you through.  You fucking happy, Bert, that we get it.  It's the same fucking joke time and time again.  Well, then...  Call up and make your fucking point.  Fucking asshole. 
[02:59:00]  That it?  Hey, dude, you're the one that called up  and fucking wrecked what was going on.  Anything else?  Cut your fucking losses, dude.  Just fucking go.  Get killed.  Oh, that was ruthless.  Oh, I was hoping he would hang up.  Oh, was that ruthless?  Angry Jimmy.  That was certainly unnecessary, wasn't it?  Stay tuned for more Unnecessary Cruelty  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Series A. 
[02:59:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Show, show, show, show, show.  Your favorite person, Bill Maher, is doing some talking.  He's trying to protect his fucking $1 million Obama investment,  so that's the only reason he's backing that horse.  Yeah.  Is that what you're talking about?  Obama talk?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I travel all over this country doing stand-up  and since Obama has been president, 
[03:00:00]  what?  It's still the exact same Kentucky-fried country  it has always been.  I see it.  People driving their cars to the mall,  buying stupid shit,  stuffing their faces,  taking pictures.  The only difference is we bump into each other more  because now we're all texting.  Because no one's at work.  All-star freedoms?  I'm pretty sure the only things Obama has killed  are Bin Laden and Donald Trump's last shred of dignity.  And cheap gas. 
[03:00:30]  If Obama were as radical as they claim,  here's what he would have already done.  Pulled the troops out of Afghanistan,  given us Medicare for all,  ended the drug war,  cut the defense budget in half,  and turned Dick Cheney over to The Hague.  Oh, I think he's a war criminal.  Is this liberal cunt bag just fucking...  He's infuriating.  Hey, the clip's not done yet.  Fuck this asshole. 
[03:01:00]  I like the mark.  I really do, yeah.  Here's what Obama actually did.  He cut taxes and spending.  Look at this graph.  No, he didn't!  I showed the growth in federal spending for...  Where's this graph come from?  I was wondering why there was silence after that.  I'm like, wow, maybe Obama really did cut taxes.  Where's this graph come from, first of all,  that he popped up?  I saw this clip.  Probably the graph store.  Yes.  It was the graph store chip.  I saw this clip, 
[03:01:30]  and he pops a graph up.  How are you telling me Obama has cut spending,  and we have a huge deficit,  bigger than has ever been before,  and it's stacked up faster  than any other president's ever stacked it up.  Nice.  Oh, God, shut up.  These bars show the growth in federal spending  for each president.  Obama is at the bottom.  Yes, the black man's is the shortest. 
[03:02:00]  Dick joke.  We get it.  Leave the dick jokes to us,  you big, far-headed fuck dick.  He didn't go on a spending spree.  He didn't break up the too-big-to-fail banks.  They've only gotten bigger and failure.  That's not what liberals wanted.  That's what conservatives wanted.  At the 28th convention,  Sarah Palin chanted,  drill, baby, drill.  Under Obama, there's more drilling than ever.  Shut up, no!  That's not what environmentalists wanted.  What's wrong, man?  We're not drilling. 
[03:02:30]  Drilling a lot.  Oh, he's fucking regulated the shit out of oil drilling,  and then refineries are fucking shut down.  How about you fucking open up the pipeline from Canada,  you fuck dicks?  And I'm not talking about the chick pipeline  that goes to my house.  Yeah.  Ladies.  There's a lot of girls in that pipeline.  This guy, what the fuck is he talking about?  Oh, fuck them all in the ass.  What is he talking about?  Oh, my gosh.  That's not what environmentalists wanted. 
[03:03:00]  That's what conservatives wanted.  Obama spent most of last year  conceding the Republican premise  that government needed cutting.  That's not what progressives wanted.  That's what the Tea Party wanted.  The Dow was at $79,49 when he took office.  Now it's $12,000 and over.  Oh, nice.  So Obama is the corporate president.  He's a lousy one.  Wow.  Wow.  Where's the fucking jobs, cocksucker?  He could not be less threatening  if he was walking home with iced tea and Skittles. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, I get it.  Less threatening than the fucking guy  that assaulted somebody.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fucking fuck.  Bill makes a point, though.  Ugh.  I can't stand that fuck asshole.  The Dow looks good.  It does look good.  Yeah.  It was $79,49 in the 12s.  Much to Obama's fucking chagrin  that they still are able to fucking conduct business.  How can we nothing chaffrown?  Double gun in the room.  Double guns. 
[03:04:00]  Ugh.  Fucking Bill Maher.  That was a good clip right there.  I agree.  I actually enjoyed it.  No.  I feel good about this country.  He's full of shit.  He's just blurting out shit.  Uh, thinking that,  oh, that's,  that's what the Tea Party wanted.  Oh, so you're saying Obama's doing shit  that the Tea Party wanted to do?  Are you really trying to twist shit around like that?  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  Fucking gas through the roof 
[03:04:30]  because this idiot won't fucking drill for oil.  Drill!  I don't think that...  Just drill holes in the country.  That wouldn't change, though.  Oh, it would.  None of the gas company.  I filled my tank up yesterday.  I had like 12 miles left.  I haven't filled it up  with,  within the best gas.  $94.  Yeah.  Don't go Supreme.  Do you know what the fucking gas prices  are based on?  Perception.  It has nothing to do with  honest logistics of gas.  It's another thing  that's based on  people's thought process.  That's the gas company.  If the president goes and says,  we're fucking drilling the shit 
[03:05:00]  out of the Gulf,  we're drilling the shit  out of Alaska,  and we're piping in fucking oil  from Canada  with a new pipeline  that's going to make jobs  when we build it,  the Keystone Pipeline.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  And you'll watch the gas prices  would drop.  But wait,  if gas prices are based on perception,  that means that you're saying  the president should drill  because the gas companies  are being scumbags,  and in order to call their bluff  when they're being scumbags,  they should drill in Alaska. 
[03:05:30]  But if the gas prices  could be brought down now,  then they should be brought down.  Let me tell you something, though.  The gas company's  not in the line of work  to make our fucking lives comfortable.  Their job is to make money.  I can't even fault them on it.  Make as much fucking money  as you can.  But if you increase the supply  so that the gas company's like,  motherfucker,  this guy's got a lot of gas.  He pulled the prices down.  Now I've got to pull the prices down.  It's supply and demand  like anything else.  But none of them would.  None of them would pull the prices down  because they're all...  It's almost like...  But they do,  but it happens. 
[03:06:00]  The price goes down  when the perception is  there's plenty of fucking oil.  When Obama won't drill  for fucking oil  until, mark my words,  toward the end of the summer,  this motherfucker's gonna say  drill, drill, drill.  So why isn't he doing it then?  He's gonna wait.  Till when?  The election?  Till the end of the summer.  And you will see  the gas price will go down  because he's gonna say something  that's gonna bring gas prices down.  And right in time for the election.  Exactly.  The other thing I want to ask you is  could you just tell the world  you're gonna drill  but not actually drill?  I would do that.  Okay.  I'd be like, 
[03:06:30]  you know what?  I'm gonna say I'm gonna drill.  Why would he just put out  a press release going,  hey, starting next year  we're just gonna drill?  Yeah.  A lot of holes.  Because he's trying  to fucking please everybody.  But that's my point.  So he doesn't want  the environmentalists  getting mad at him  because that's pretty much  his constituency.  When does it go from  we're gonna drill  to the gas prices going down?  Like, you know what I'm saying?  It's pretty quick.  So if all you have to do  is go on TV  and say we're gonna drill  and then the prices  would go down?  We're gonna drill  and we're gonna fucking  open up the pipeline,  a Keystone pipeline.  So could you whisper  to the other people 
[03:07:00]  that don't like that idea  and go,  okay, don't worry about it.  We're not actually drilling.  Spotted Owl's fine.  Spotted Owl will be fine.  I'm coddling him myself.  That's so fucking weird.  Obama's chewing up food  and spitting it  in baby birds' mouths.  But if the gas companies,  I know they have to make money  and they're a company  and they should be able  to make money.  Yeah.  But if what they do  affects the fucking lifeblood  of the country  and they,  don't we have any right  to say anything about it?  I don't know if we do.  Okay.  Then you're getting 
[03:07:30]  into the whole thing of  do you want more  government regulation  based on national security  or something?  In some cases,  regulations are okay  because when you  deregulate the banks  and look how they behave,  look at how  they have no giving a fuck  at all about the people under them.  Well, this is why  I don't like the idea  of bailing these motherfuckers out either.  Right.  If you fuck up  and are greedy  to the point  where your whole company 
[03:08:00]  and system collapses,  you should be fucking done  and let someone else move in  that's maybe a little more  ethical  but we don't penalize them  the same.  It's like a weird  catch-22 of us.  We don't,  those guys don't.  Catch-44 is twice as good.  I was going to say  catch-11 is half as bad.  Double guns.  Math jokes.  They don't,  but they don't,  they don't go to prison  unless they're like  Bernie Madoff  and they're so obvious.  Those guys still skate out  with their money.  Like they don't suffer  the same penalties.  Like we try, 
[03:08:30]  all right,  we shouldn't regulate  because it's a free contract.  You can do what you want.  Okay, great.  Yeah.  But then they do this  horrible shit  and they continually  get away with it.  Then let them fail.  Let them fucking fail.  But they still bail out  with a lot of money.  The guys that did it  always bail out  with a lot of money.  They never go to prison.  So the company  a lot of times  does fail  or just gets merged  into a bigger company.  Like those guys  don't pay the price  that you and I  would have to pay.  Do you honestly think  the government  putting their fucking  incompetent face  in there  is going to help 
[03:09:00]  the situation?  They prove they can't  do anything right.  You're right.  They do stink.  But them saying  that you can't do  certain things,  I'm all for business  making what they got to make.  Yeah.  But when it goes beyond  a certain point  of good conscience  where they don't give a fuck  about any of us,  they really,  in a lot of cases,  they really fucking don't.  There are plenty  of laws in place  that are supposed  to keep the average Joe  from getting fucked  by these guys.  But, man,  there's like,  but the government 
[03:09:30]  regulations,  they skirt them  so easily  because the politicians  are so quick  to bail these guys out  because they're the ones  supplying them  with the money  to get re-elected  and keep their towns  and cities making money  because they keep  the businesses there  because they count out  of these fucking  greedy pigs.  I understand,  but more importantly,  and I'm going to  whisper this,  uh, feedback  because I don't want to...  Master Queef,  shut the fuck up!  You're a cunt!  Thank you.  Let me whisper... 
[03:10:00]  I'm going to whisper  this, uh,  this feedback  because I don't want  to piss you off.  Okay, go ahead.  Fix in Denver says  all Ant is doing  is blurting out shit, too.  Am I blurting out shit?  No.  He said all Ant is doing  is blurting out shit.  Is that all I'm doing?  Really?  Because that's what you said  about Bill Maher.  Yeah, Bill Maher is blurting out...  That's what you said  about Bill Maher.  But Bill Maher is blurting out...  That's what you're doing, too.  Inaccuracies.  That you're both blurting out shit.  Inaccuracies.  You're both blurting out shit.  I'm blurting out fact! 
[03:10:30]  You're blurting out shit.  I'm not blurting out  fucking inaccuracies  like, like, uh,  Bill Maher  with his dumb graph  telling me how much  fucking Obama  is in spending.  Meanwhile,  uh, fucking  trillions upon trillions  of dollars  and, and, and, uh...  Oh, my God.  It just says  you're blurting out shit, too.  Shit, shit, shit, shit!  I'm blurting shit!  What's that?  What's that?  No, Chip.  Oh, it said shit,  not chip.  Uh, so I guess  Romney's picking Donald Trump.  That's good news.  No way. 
[03:11:00]  Well, Donald Trump's  telling everyone.  Donald Trump's  out of his fucking gourd.  I was wondering  what he was thinking.  Be careful.  I want to go fly, uh,  fishing with his son,  so let's be careful with that.  Yeah.  But, uh, Donald Trump  is basically saying that,  you know,  he would accept the, uh,  VP if Romney asked him.  Yeah.  And then people are going,  well, has he asked you?  Well, no.  No.  Well, if he does,  I'm going to accept.  I'm going to ask him.  The VP is the next little...  Well, why doesn't the rest  of the press  fucking say that,  that he's never going  to be asked?  But they just run  with the story  like it's a legitimate possibility. 
[03:11:30]  Because he's good with...  Trump, if you're in the media,  he's a great soundbite guy.  But why doesn't the press  call him out on it  and go,  look, idiot,  Romney's not  picking you for the VP.  No.  Romney's VP choice is...  Very important.  This is now the, uh,  the teeter-totter point  because, uh,  apparently Obama  is very vulnerable  at this point  to lose the election.  With women?  With a lot of people.  He's alienated  some of his, um...  What if he gets Hillary  and tells Biden 
[03:12:00]  to sit it out?  No.  He's got to stick with Biden.  It'll look,  it'll look weird  if he changes now.  It'll look weak.  So, so,  who's on the short list  for Romney?  Um, I don't know.  I think you've got to go  with the Mexican.  What about the fatso?  No, no.  He ain't gonna fuck.  No fatso?  No.  Go with Rubio?  No fatso.  I'm gonna,  I think Rubio.  Rubio?  Um, even money?  Yeah.  People are so mad  with Obama  about, uh,  unemployment  just going on  so fucking long.  So long. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, I know.  It's, it's,  it's been very high  and, um,  the economy  in general  is just,  and how long  could you say,  keep saying  you inherited this?  We inherited this  from George W. Bush.  Well, fix it!  If I buy a fucking car  with a flat tire,  I don't drive around  for four years  and say,  well, the guy  that sold it to me  sold it with a flat.  I inherited this flat tire.  Well, we all do that.  No, you fucking fix it!  We all blame  everything else  on somebody else.  God damn! 
[03:13:00]  Or you flatten  the other four tires  and drive it like that.  Well, I had one flat tire,  so now I just flatten  the other three  and drive.  You said the other four,  that would be five tires.  Five tires,  let's spare two.  Oh, no.  Jimmy, I'm mad.  I'm trying to make  sound bites  for Drew Boogie's  next song.  Are you blurting  out more shit?  I'm blurting more shit!  This is just blurting?  Yes.  But it's true.  It's like,  fix it.  How long could you  blame the fucking guy  before?  He's had a lot of time.  If he wasn't so busy,  campaigning  and fucking  do the job 
[03:13:30]  instead of trying  to keep the fucking job.  God damn.  I'm going home.  I'm going home.  Oh, my outrage is over.  Cool.  Now I just drive  on the road  and let me say,  I'll blurt out  racial epithets  for Asians  and African Americans  on my drive home.  Then I'll get home  and take a nap  and I'll have visions  of sugar plums  dancing in my head.  I have  to take my 
[03:14:00]  boneyard show.  Oh, you're doing  the boneyard.  Yeah.  And I'm going to try  to get my Bobby Brown  photo.  Oh.  And let's go home.  And June 9th,  I will be performing  June 9th  at the MGM Grand  Casino, Foxwoods.  Oh.  Is it Foxwoods?  Better be.  I hope so.  You said it.  Now it's going to  seem silly if it's not.  I believe it is.  Oh, boy.  With myself  and Ari Lang  and Nick DiPaolo  and Dave Addle.  I don't know.  Their sense of humor 
[03:14:30]  is a little too blue.  It's a little too harsh  with the language.  It's very blue.  I don't care  for that type of language.  MGM Grand Theater  at Foxwoods.  There it is.  Yep.  Foxwoods.  Very cool.  All right, everybody.  What a fun day today.  Yes, it was.  And we'll have  more fun tomorrow.  Stay tuned for  The Shit Show  with Sam Shit Show Roberts.  Just say after show.  All right, the after show.  The after birth.  All right, my friends. 
[03:15:00]  We'll see you  manana.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony  show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like  sticking around  after one day live  is next.  Next.  Next.  Next. </pre>
