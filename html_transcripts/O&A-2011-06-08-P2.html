<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's "After ONA Live" segment, hosted by Sam Roberts, heavily featured the aftermath of an incident involving Opie, Anthony Cumia, and guest Andrew Breitbart.  Breitbart showed them a picture of Anthony Weiner's penis on his phone. Opie tried to photograph the image on Breitbartâ€™s phone, but Cumia intercepted him. Both Opie and Cumia then tweeted blurry versions of the picture, overloading various photo servers and sparking a significant online frenzy.  They engaged in a competitive game of tweeting the blurry image to numerous news outlets and personalities, including CNN, Fox News, Gawker, Huffington Post, and TMZ.

Ron Bennington called in to react to the unfolding events.  The discussion covered the potential consequences of their actions, speculating on Breitbart's response and the possibility of disciplinary action from Sirius XM.  The conversation branched out to other subjects, including Bennington's personal experiences, Jimmy Fallon's Anthony Weiner-themed comedy, Jim Norton's celebrity photo encounters, and a humorous anecdote about a hotel's attempt to curb sexual assaults by having maids wear pants. The segment concluded with the playing of "30 Days in the Hole" by Humble Pie.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, buddy.  Is that one on?  You're behind my board.  Speaking of board...  You gotta turn that on.  Speaking of board...  Yeah?  It's the shit hour with Sam Roberts.  When I say board, like mixing board. 
[00:00:30]  B-O-A-R-D.  I thought you meant board shitless like the people are  when you're not playing our clips.  You know, Anthony, Mr. Anthony's all talk  because I watch your driving videos  and I know who you listen to on the drive home.  Oh, he did catch me.  Sam, I'm gonna give you an exclusive on this shit hour.  There's always been a speculation that me and Ann...  You know, that I met at Ann and we...  Hatred is the word that pops up.  Well, officially, I'm mad with Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, shit.  And I have a problem with Anthony.  Wow.  Well, let's get into this a little bit.  Sure, no problem.  We had Andrew Breitbart, who's pretty much...  Is it Breitbart or Breitbart?  Breitbart.  It's Breitbart.  We learned Breitbart today.  It's Breitbart.  And obviously, he brooked in Anthony Weiner's scandal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And obviously, he has, in my opinion, a cockpick of Anthony Weiner.  Well, it's no longer an opinion.  I mean...  True.  There was a penis on that phone.  I saw it.  I think we saw something there.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  What the hell?  He passed around the picture. 
[00:01:30]  We all saw Anthony Weiner's Weiner, according to Andrew Breitbart.  And I was being very, very, very clever.  And I was taking a picture of Andrew Breitbart's phone, when Anthony, out of nowhere, panics  and rips the phone out of my hand.  So, I tweeted a very blurry picture of what I was looking at.  You tweeted it anyway.  Yes, because I'm mad.  Well, I thought...  I mean, I saw the picture, and then I'm like, look, this guy obviously wants the picture  out there.  He just doesn't want it to come from him.  He handed the phone around, knowing what kind of guys we are.  I put the phone on the board here. 
[00:02:00]  I pick up my phone, and I had to wait for that delay.  Take a picture of the picture.  And Anthony rips my phone away.  Okay, so now you see something very blurry.  But that was a breach of trust, I think.  Oh, and then he showed it to the Paltalk camera.  Wait, wait, wait.  Well, they inadvertently got on the Paltalk camera.  I think you didn't want me to throw it out there.  You wanted to throw it out there.  I had no idea if I wanted to throw it out there.  See, we got problems now.  No, if I would have wanted to throw it out there, I would have thrown it out there the  other night.  We got problems.  I could have absolutely gotten it off of his iPad the other night when he walked away.  I thought that you were trying to protect your relationship with Andrew when you took the phone 
[00:02:30]  away from Opie.  What were you doing?  You showed it on Paltalk?  I wasn't logged on.  He didn't show it on Paltalk.  By accident, Paltalk saw it because he was actually showing me again when I was missing.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think it ended up, it might have hit the Paltalk screen.  You bear with the angle sometimes.  But yeah, because I thought he was looking at you with that, and I thought you were doing  one of those things like, you know how sometimes you do something to get people's goat, but  you're not really going to do it? 
[00:03:00]  No, he was doing it.  I was under the impression that that's what was going on.  So I do apologize.  I inadvertently...  You were just doing it for the bit.  For the bit.  For the bit.  For the bit.  For the bit.  I'm doing it for the bit.  I have 500 at mentions right now.  Oh no.  I think my blurry picture's going around already.  Well, if Breitbart didn't have a reason to try to end this show before...  Oh, what?  I'm getting him back for the Homeless Charlie thing.  I didn't forget.  Come up in.  Look, I just tweeted a very blurry picture of what might be Wiener's Wiener. 
[00:03:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, the sex man has something to say.  Where you posted the photo is crashing, because it's impossible to load right now.  Is that true?  Yeah, I can't get to it.  The photo server or whatever it is?  It loads halfway and then stops.  Well, the beauty of this photo is no one could claim it's a penis officially.  I mean, it looks a lot like a penis.  Oh, shit.  See, this is a bad one right there.  What?  What does it say?  This is...  What is it?  That's the one from PalTalk, I think.  Oh, no.  Oops. 
[00:04:00]  Well, of course we're the ones that got the photo out there.  Oops.  Of course he came to the right place.  And of course, once again, Opie and Anthony have a worldwide exclusive...  Good thing we videotaped his one and only appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  Why don't you start by going to my Twitter, Opie Radio.  That's spelled O-P-I-E, radio.  You know, Anthony, if you want to...  And you get to see Anthony's hand as he's being a nosy buddy and pulling the phone away.  If you want to one-up Opie, you could retweet whoever tweeted the PalTalk screen grab. 
[00:04:30]  What?  I just did.  Oh, my goodness.  And then I cut his name off of it.  Oh, so it's all Anthony Cumia.  So now it says Anthony Cumia and at CNN.  And it says, TwitPic, brief art showing pictures on Opie and Anthony of Rep Wiener.  And it's the one...  It's the actual one from...  That you could see clear as a bell.  Oh, I nailed you.  Opie, you got one.  Look at the one I got.  It's too small.  No, look.  Oh.  Let me see yours.  Did he get it?  Did you get it just now? 
[00:05:00]  No.  I got to take a picture of it.  Wait, you two.  Keep doing that.  Keep doing that.  Let me see.  We got a...  This is a beautiful moment.  Dude, this is huge.  We're fucked.  We're fucked.  Fuck everybody.  I think we're in big trouble.  Why are we in big trouble?  I don't know.  I'm going to...  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Wait.  I want to see...  Let me see.  Is this what you just showed me?  No, I'm going to take a picture of what you just showed me that I showed you.  Hold on a minute.  Let's keep this thing going.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[00:05:30]  Holy shit.  Of course, everything has to start with...  Hold on a minute.  This is craziness.  I can't even get on my fucking Twitter.  Oh, no.  I can't get on Twitter.  I told you it was crazy.  Did you guys crash Twitter?  I think we crashed...  This, by the way, is the hugest picture ever to be on Twitter, I think.  Of course it is.  Wouldn't you think?  Oh, did we fuck this up?  Oh.  I think we're in big trouble.  This is one of those things that are very short...  Just pretend you were trying to direct message somebody.  Yes.  It was meant as a private message.  How would we find this Twitter?  Wait.  Tell them...  OpiRadio.  P-I-E. 
[00:06:00]  R-A-D-I-O.  Anthony.  I need followers.  I need followers.  I have less than you.  I'll admit it.  I'm a Twitter whore.  Anthony Cumia.  No, but I just...  A-N-T-H-O-N-Y-C-U-M-I-A.  I just tweeted...  It's like Cumia.  I just tweeted the picture from your phone, though.  But you tweeted the picture from my phone, but I tweeted the picture that I have on my  phone.  No.  It doesn't matter.  This is...  I can't believe we're having a wiener war.  This is...  Wiener War 2011!  Wiener War.  Pick from...  ONA Wiener War.  From...  It's on the TV. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, boy.  Apple TV used in all its glory.  There's a wiener's wiener is on earth.  Run the middle of a wiener war.  And this is not...  Open radio on Twitter!  This is not, by the way, that underpants picture where you could see the outline of his penis.  No, no.  This is penis.  This is the actual penis picture that everyone has been clamoring about.  Holy crap.  Oh, boy.  Whoops.  Oh, boy.  It's...  Yeah, but you don't know who...  Okay.  Hold on.  I'm going to win this because you don't know who to fucking add to your tweets. 
[00:07:00]  Look what I do.  What?  You have no idea.  Watch.  Watch the other.  He tweeted CNN.  CNN.  They ain't going to show up and know who will.  Fox News.  James Earl Jones.  Gawker.  Huffington Post.  Gawker.  Gawker.  And...  What happened?  Jump on this one.  Jump on this one, Roland.  Can't get on Twitter?  And...  I can't get on...  What was it?  What would Tyler Durden do?  His WWTD da da da ba ba?  Okay, because fuck TMZ.  Fuck TMZ.  I just...  And now I fucking tweeted it! 
[00:07:30]  I just...  I just tweeted a picture of your phone of the photograph that you took away from  God the first time around.  And we got a release.  Yeah.  Wait, but...  What?  And we got a release.  We got a release!  We got a release!  Yay!  Roland's not getting fired, no matter what anyone says!  All right, now what are you going to do?  Listen, I just...  How are you going to beat that?  I just have both of you.  I could do the same thing.  Shut up, Seth.  It's not about you.  It's so good.  Oh, yes it is.  My picture's clearer.  No, look.  Now you take...  Yeah, I mean, that is a picture of a picture. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, look how great mine is.  Now you take a picture of my picture of a picture.  No, mine's great.  But you want to tweet the picture of the picture of the picture?  No, I'm just treating the picture.  Boom.  Gotcha.  See, I got this one.  That one's fucking...  Oh, that one's not good.  That one's great.  That's not good.  That's the picture.  Well, I got a picture of you and Ant tweeting cockpictures on my Twitter.  Well, what is that going to do?  Hey, aren't they going to fucking kick us off?  No, I got excited.  Cockpictures on Twitter?  Probably.  Shit.  Good thing I just took a picture of you guys tweeting, not actually... 
[00:08:30]  Damn, I need my account.  I don't know.  Yeah, so you guys are going to get a ton of followers and then get thrown off Twitter.  No, they kick you off the picture side, I think.  Oh, oh, oh.  I think.  Oh, what the hell.  Yeah, it's worth a shot.  Twitter can't kick you off.  Holy shit.  I can't even update.  Nothing's updating.  Oh, boy.  Well, Roland's getting on the web-based Twitter.  I don't know.  Anthony Cumia and Opie Radio both have the Representative Wiener penis pictures.  See, but that guy can't prove that's a Wiener pick. 
[00:09:00]  We made it bigger.  Only we could prove that it's a Wiener pick.  No, that's a Wiener pick.  We made it bigger on the TV there.  Plus, that guy stinks.  Nobody's following him anyway.  He's just a guy.  Go to my...  Oh, this is big.  What do I do?  At...  Let me see.  No.  TMZ.  At...  No.  You got to add TMZ.  TMZ.  No.  Wait, wait.  TMZ.  Yeah, TMZ.  Gawker.  Shit.  Come on, TMZ.  TMZ.  Oh, boy. 
[00:09:30]  At...  At...  Opie was right with the gawker.  Yeah, it's too late, Ann.  I already did all that.  That's okay.  They got a better picture.  It's too late, because...  Now you got a good picture.  Look, you zoom in, and it's your picture.  What about Jimmy Fallon?  He played Wiener yesterday.  Golf.  He can't show it.  Jimmy Fallon is not the cockpit type, is he?  No, he played Wiener in a bit.  Really?  At...  Oh, the papers?  Oh, New York Post.  Fox.  At New York Post.  Dead and...  News.  NY Daily News.  Whoa.  What?  At...  N-Y... 
[00:10:00]  Daily...  At...  ...  This is incredible.  The scoop being broken here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  You're shocked, Sam?  We're still here.  It's our show.  No, you're not. 
[00:10:30]  Well, you are here, but this is not your show.  Nice try.  It's not a try.  At...  What else?  Go...  What do you got so far?  At the Daily News.  The Post.  Let's find the Washington Journal for you.  At Not Sam.  The Huffington Post.  Yeah, Huffington would like that.  Throw that on there.  The Huffington boys are all about this.  At Rolando's 99.  That's Rolando's 99.  We got the Wiener pick.  Okay, I think that... 
[00:11:00]  Oh, boy.  I can't believe how...  How quick, Ant, is it going to be before you're hearing from Breitbart?  What the fuck did you guys do?  Oh, my God.  I can't...  I'm not accepting tweets today.  He's on his way to a plane right now, so he's hasn't...  Oh, that's right.  He's heading back out to L.A.  I just got booked on MSNBC.  That quick?  Yep.  That's incredible.  Ant TV bookings?  I'll be on Hannity on the 27th.  That's not for this.  Although, now you'll have something to talk about on Hannity.  That takes the pressure off, doesn't it? 
[00:11:30]  Ah, shit.  I got too many fucking...  I got too many symbols.  Is this official, though?  We're the ones that got it out there?  Of course you are.  Who else could possibly have it?  It's been on Breitbart's phone, and he specifically...  He told you today, we have audio of him saying,  do not send this to anyone.  What?  It really looks like graffiti.  It's a perfect graffiti wiener.  It's exactly what you draw on a wall.  That's the beauty of this.  That's the beauty of this.  He said, don't show this to anybody.  It's Opie and Anthony, and we're doing a little extra time today. 
[00:12:00]  What happened to your mic?  I don't know.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Because we got...  Yeah.  Why are you trying to plug things in?  You know I turned it off.  80.  Well, I was trying to go with your little game.  You were trying to go with the bit?  Sam, this is much bigger than the shit hour.  This is much bigger than Opie and Anthony themselves.  This is...  Twitter.  We are the ones saying, fuck it.  And we're the ones...  Let's sever another relationship.  What about the Drudge Report?  At Drudge Report!  At Drudge Report.  Well, how about Huffington Post?  How about some of our listeners start throwing this shit around there, too? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, motherfucker.  But give us credit.  They won't.  You don't have to give us credit.  They're horrible people.  They have to give us credit.  They probably will.  They love seeing the Opie and Anthony name in the news.  You have to.  I'm being called a genius.  Are you being called a genius on your Twitter right now?  Uh, that's a daily occurrence.  What else is new?  We're all over Google Live results.  Hey, wait a minute.  Oh, my God.  What was the other one?  At what?  HuffPost.  No, no.  Drudge Report. 
[00:13:00]  Drudge.  Oh, I got one.  At Opie Radio.  O-P-I-E Radio.  One word.  I think that's why I don't have a lot of followers, because I don't really know how to spell Opie yet.  Well, Anthony Comey is not easy, either.  It's A-N-T-H-O-N-Y, but then it's C-U-M-I-A.  All one word.  Anthony Comey.  Not Sam's very easy.  Look, my...  There's Drudge Report sent again to all those that I sent, and now Drudge Report.  Hold on.  Wow.  My thought on this, because we'll get some real talk out of this...  This is going to be big.  I have a strong feeling, because I've been doing this for a very long time with Anthony, 
[00:13:30]  right?  That that guy...  Breitbart?  ...wanted this out there.  And that's why he was letting you pass his phone around the room?  We got cameras, we got video, we got assholes, we got everything in here.  I was holding a video camera when he passed me the phone.  Like, you'd think if he really didn't want it out there, he'd tell me to turn the camera off.  And you would think if you were smart, you would have fucking got it on your video camera.  It's on a taped video camera.  By the time I'm done uploading it, it's already out there. 
[00:14:00]  It's yesterday's technology.  Should we go to the phones for praise?  Yes, of course.  Should we go to the phones for praise?  Why wouldn't we?  For praise.  Just click line one.  Huh?  We don't screen on the after show.  Oh, you don't?  No.  You have to deal?  30 fucking...  Hi.  You're on line one, you're on after Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  You!  Hello?  Go.  Go.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, sir.  Tell Sam the...  I don't know what you're saying, sir. 
[00:14:30]  Sir, I don't know what you're saying, sir.  What did you say?  What are you saying, sir?  What are you saying?  Screw it.  Go to line two.  Line two.  Line two, looking for praise today.  How are you?  How are you going to praise us?  I actually want to complain because this is supposed to be the shit hour.  Ronnie!  This is supposed to be the hour that I can actually work.  I'll get him.  Ronnie!  There's Ron Bennington.  Ronnie, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron.  Ron Bennington is an old salt.  He'll tell us what to do here.  This is big.  Ron Bennington.  He's talking to Spencer.  I'm telling him.  Come on.  Ron Bennington.  Ron, and don't throw the... 
[00:15:00]  Don't play the crashing sound effect.  We're not part of it.  We need Ron Bennington.  No, we should.  I mean, that's his sound effect.  Do not do it, Iraq.  Don't do it.  Oh, my...  Who is he?  Ron Bennington.  Ron.  There it is, Ron.  There it is.  That's Representative Wiener's Wiener.  This is insane.  We've just tweeted it.  We tweeted to the world.  It's a poor quality, but it is there.  I think he had a bike accident when he was younger.  You've got to be so careful.  I don't know why that was considered a boy's bike. 
[00:15:30]  That bar never belonged there.  The boy's bike should have been a girl's bike from day one.  What are you doing here, Ron?  We have just tweeted this to every news agency.  We just tweeted to everybody.  Because Breitbart couldn't help himself.  He was passing the phone around, and we're like, fuck that.  We're taking pictures of his phone.  He wanted to get it out there.  He just didn't want to do it himself.  What was he worried about doing it himself for?  I think he has been saying that he did not want to get this out there because of the family. 
[00:16:00]  He called it an insurance policy.  It's an insurance policy.  Which has now been released.  Will keep Wiener from making these women victims and whatnot.  How do we know that's not Breitbart's cock?  Oh, good point.  Oh, my God.  I hope it is.  We matched up the chest.  We matched up the chest.  Breitbart does not have an ab.  It's an ab.  By the way, I wrote up with him.  He was sweating like a wild man before he got here.  He sweats like crazy, that guy.  Sweating.  I think because he's always looking over his shoulder. 
[00:16:30]  Because apparently people are stealing pictures off his phone and tweeting them.  Well, that could be it.  By the way, is he happy about this?  We've yet to find out, but I think it's going to be very angry.  He specifically sat in that chair and said, whatever you do, don't share this with anyone.  And, Ron, we waited for him to leave because we're that brave.  Okay, he's better.  As soon as he was out of sight, we started tweeting.  So this is not going to be a long-term relationship with him.  Do we have many long-term relationships?  No.  You really don't.  I think you're the only one at this point, Ron, and I don't even know why you stay around. 
[00:17:00]  When it comes to the most anticipated photo in the country, I think we could sacrifice, you know, the white bar connection.  Now, how is this going to make the paper tomorrow?  What are they going to do?  How much of it do they...  I think they could blur out the tip of one of the nuts and get it on there.  One ball and the head.  You turn it sideways, it looks like it might be, I don't know, some kind of creature.  It's also not a...  Some kind of snail from the beach or something.  It's blurry and it's zoomed out enough that it's kind of not... 
[00:17:30]  You can't even really tell what it is.  Very difficult to us.  See, up to this point, everybody has been having a lot of fun with the wiener joke over and over.  But you guys just flashed out a hard cock.  Now watch.  The fun leaves the story.  Yes, it does.  As of right now.  Yeah, it does.  What are you going to do?  Of course we had to do this, Ron.  Right.  Of course.  We've needed a big hit.  It's been too long.  We need a push.  I think it's been four years in between hits here.  Well, how long before you've been to the corner office, though? 
[00:18:00]  That's where this normally bleeds.  Yeah.  I don't know how this will get there, though.  I mean...  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What problem could they possibly have?  You know...  Well, that's right.  They'll have one.  They'll find one.  You know who's really responsible for this?  Who?  Who needs to get in trouble?  Huh?  Is Roland.  I think Roland's the ball on this one.  I think Roland's the one to drop the ball on this one.  Maybe firing him is the way to go.  Roland dropped the ball.  Was this your guest?  It was Anthony's.  No, but it was my guest.  Anthony was drinking with him.  I went drinking with him. 
[00:18:30]  It was a Cumia booking.  He went out with the young Republicans, excuse me, and brought Andrew in.  It was me, Wiener, went out with Ann Coulter, the red-eyed people.  All the Nazis got together.  So we all sort of got to see the picture.  And today, now everybody passed it around.  Why don't you have Ann Coulter in that picture, though?  It should be like leaning up, like, maybe she's passed out.  You're holding that up to your garage.  Hey!  That would be a good one.  I do have a picture of Ann Coulter. 
[00:19:00]  I'm now tweeting the screen.  You're tweeting a tweet?  My mind is fucking blown.  This is crazy.  SiriusXN PR is right outside.  I think we need to get them involved in this.  This is fuck pushing her.  Ann Coulter looking at the picture.  That's Ann Coulter actually looking at the picture.  Oh, she's got her hand over her mouth.  Yeah, she's shocked.  This needs to be tweeted.  Now this needs to be put out there.  You know, we showed restraint.  We've been sitting on this.  Not on the cock, of course.  We've been sitting on this. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, God, that'd be awful.  We've been sitting on this cock.  We've been sitting on this thing for two days.  We're showing restraint, Ronnie.  Yeah.  Yes.  Did you interview Glenn Close?  Yes, I did.  Did you feel like he could maybe get a piece of that?  I felt a little something going on.  64 years old, too.  Yeah, she's very, very...  64?  She holds up very well.  Better than she looks on television and the movies right now.  I didn't know she was 64.  64.  Yeah.  I did a little Google.  A little Wikipedia.  But she's cool.  She is.  She's... 
[00:20:00]  You probably did a much better interview than we did.  No, no, no.  Don't put yourself down, I'll be.  She was even saying afterwards.  She was like that thing.  She goes, I didn't know where.  I didn't tell Jimmy to put his hands, but it was like, you know, acting is as hard as  he says.  It was good.  I make believe I hear that for the first time every time he does that.  Every single time.  Well, you know, it's hard.  I don't know what to do.  That's a great question, Jimmy.  I don't know.  What do you do?  What do you do when the other person...  How do you pretend that you're listening?  And Vince goes, you just listen, idiot.  Yeah, you just listen.  But he's running his lines in his mind.  Right. 
[00:20:30]  I wonder how Jimmy...  If these things work for Jimmy.  What?  These questions when he asks about acting.  No, he'll forget the answer.  You know, I...  He's not interested in the answer.  He's too busy figuring out how he's going to get his picture done after the interview.  He's thinking about his next line.  Here's what I'm going to say.  He's got to ask questions until the photo op starts.  Are you part of Lady Gaga gate that happened yesterday?  A few people are a little mad.  What happened?  A little Jimmy Norton didn't get his picture.  Well, I came in late because I'm at jury duty.  And when I came in, it was kind of relaxed and I had a picture taken with her. 
[00:21:00]  And she goes, yeah, she said anybody else after that.  And that was it?  But the thing with Jimmy is, like, we should, in my opinion, just get his picture taken  with whoever he wants to.  Yeah.  Because he needs it.  He does need it.  We're all better off at that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, the day I had Kevorkian, I just looked up in my window, there's Jimmy, and he's kind  of pacing back and forth.  And I'm like, let me call him in real quick.  Let's just get this over with.  This is Jim Norton.  He's a very well-known comedian.  He's on HBO. 
[00:21:30]  He's, you know, get this shot.  And then he's...  You can see the satisfaction hit him.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's the same way you feel when you come.  Now I can relax, go to sleep, smoke a cigarette.  There was a great moment with Malcolm McDowell.  Jimmy got his stuff signed after the interview, which, what a great day we had.  And as soon as Malcolm McDowell signed everything Jimmy needed signed, he grabbed it and ran  into the corner to put it all away safely.  Yeah.  And Malcolm was trying to get his attention and say, hey, I had a fun, thanks, you know,  nice meeting you.  And he's done.  Wanted a handshake. 
[00:22:00]  And Jimmy was too distracted to make sure everything was protected that he got signed.  Again, it's almost like after you come, when the woman tries to either hug you or say, you know, you're trying to get away.  That thing that had you so obsessed just a little while earlier, now you're like, please  shut up.  Your voice makes me sick.  That's Jimmy.  Because the goal's been completed.  But that's why get it for him as quickly as you possibly can.  Sorry, I distracted you there, but Rob Cross, God, what a company, corporate guy.  He wants to keep everything safe around here because we have, which might be the Anthony 
[00:22:30]  Wiener penis photo up on the screen here.  It appears to be.  Yes.  And good old Rob Cross closing the curtains because certainly no one wants to see the Anthony  Wiener cockpit if this, of course, is.  He is already in his mind thinking how he can distance himself from anything that happened.  Or is it going great?  Let me swing in and take credit.  Yeah.  What do I do?  Let me see which way the wind goes.  Yes.  Everybody is Larry Tate in this fucking building. 
[00:23:00]  Larry Tate?  Darren Stevens, fucking boss.  Whatever they can do to take credit and push away blame.  Oh, Mr. Smith, I'm so sorry he came up with that idea.  Obviously, we'll think of a better campaign.  I love it, Tate.  Well, he loves it.  Of course, it's a wonderful idea.  We've done it again.  Stevens.  Oh, yeah, well.  That Tate.  Hey, we got an update.  Where has this picture gone?  There's social networking.  It gets around quickly.  Is it working yet?  It hasn't hit anywhere yet. 
[00:23:30]  Nowhere.  The server's been crashing.  Well, it's been retweeted by Cigars and Scotch.  Yeah, right.  That means.  Starting.  I'm sorry.  Coke Logic is really pushing this through.  Every second I hit the refresh, it's another like 60.  Yeah, I can't.  It's now spreading like wildfire, if I could say.  Yeah.  Wildfire.  We should play that song, Wildfire, while this is all going on.  Maybe it will.  Everybody's witnessing history.  Hold on.  What happened?  Yes, this is history in the making.  Did the horse get out in the cold?  It's so sad.  I think that's what happened.  It died or something.  It's more wildfire.  During a killing frost? 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  How cold was it that a horse died?  She ran calling wildfire.  I was like, I'm anxious to see because Twitter is my name's Sam Roberts.  I host this show.  I host this show.  It's not the Ronnie and Sam Sweetheart, Sam Sweetheart and Ron show.  That show's been canceled.  It was canceled?  Yeah.  I thought it was just on hiatus.  But let me just say this.  The other night, best special delivery all time.  You know.  Kicked ass.  You know goddamn well.  What would you do differently, Sam?  I didn't show up.  Oh.  And Ron knew that when he said that. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Well, who filled in for you?  I heard Dave's wife was awful.  It actually kicked ass.  Did it?  I'm sure it did.  She said, loved it.  Loved it.  Well, they're both talented people.  That's the show they told him to do years ago.  You should be back with Than.  I'm not going to.  Yeah.  That was the show.  That was the show.  That was the show.  Although Sam's name was second, so he probably felt a little off on that.  I'm not doing that again.  Than and Sam.  Yeah.  Now it's Sam and Dave.  You always put Sam first, right?  I always said it that way, yeah.  Thank you.  Plus, I'm not going to do it.  It's all video game talk with him now. 
[00:25:00]  I didn't know.  Rockstar.  Yeah, he's rockstarring.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Ronnie, I want to congratulate you for the blueberry incident.  Oh, yeah.  It went over well.  Yeah.  I caught some heat on that, by the way.  Why?  Well, you're the easiest person.  Also, I was listening to Ryan.  You told Fez that I was entirely responsible for it.  I'm trying to teach Fez to win a fight.  You know what I mean?  So, I'm like, you know, if you're breaking into boxing or you've had a couple losses, don't go calling out the champ. 
[00:25:30]  No.  You know, look for somebody else.  Come in the month club.  Can you teach Fez not to believe every single thing you say?  No, I don't even know what you mean by that.  I mean, I'm sitting here and I'm just...  You know who got into your head?  Yo.  That goddamn Jay Moore.  That Jay Moore.  He has a way of doing that.  He has a way of doing that.  Because, and think to yourself, has Jay ever said anything that made sense?  Very rarely.  Does anyone in the business go, hey, you know who's got a good head on the shoulders? 
[00:26:00]  That Jay Moore really is thinking.  He's a man you've got to listen to.  Yeah.  He's great at impressions.  It's Jay Moore that gets him in trouble.  How are things between Fez and the Stangles?  Oh, boy.  Why?  Why?  Seriously, that's why I'm asking.  This is why I hope he calls you the shitster.  Well, because Justin Stangles had a lot to do with that day.  That's going to cause the whole thing now.  He's stirring.  He's stirring again.  You know that's going to cause a whole thing.  And I know...  You and fucking Jay Moore.  Seriously.  Well, I know Eric Stangles is sitting there writing for Justin while Justin is saying 
[00:26:30]  these terrible things.  I know that's happening.  Kenny, I'll be right down.  Is he waiting?  I think Kenny's waiting for me, yeah.  Something's different today.  I don't know.  I lost track of time like a doggy.  But I'll wag my tail and lick his face when he shows.  This is going to mess up my 10-minute nap that starts at 11 usually every day since  I've been alive.  So when does this thing blow up?  When does this...  I don't know.  Well, some message boards have been picking it up.  The most anticipated picture. 
[00:27:00]  None that I've ever heard of.  This is the most anticipated picture.  Well, that was the first attempt at tweeting it, Ron.  And you could see Anthony ripping the phone away from me because he wanted the credit.  No, I didn't want the credit.  You're causing a major strife in this fucking partnership.  I didn't want him in the room while it was happening.  Partnership.  Partnership.  Look at that.  It was just fooling around.  I almost had it perfect.  Now they get to see your hand in a blurry thing.  Was it on your phone first?  No, it was originally on Breitbart's phone.  Breitbart's phone.  And Breitbart passed it around the room so we could all see.  I put the phone down and picked up my phone like any guy would do. 
[00:27:30]  So then I was showing it to Opie, but I was leaning it toward the Paltalk camera.  Okay.  So they screen capped it, sent it back to me, and that's what I sent out.  And Opie got the picture of me on my phone.  He tweeted the tweet of my tweet.  But you got the tweet first.  He got the picture.  You got the tweet.  Then you got the tweet of your tweet.  Yes, yes, yes.  So we're both all over the place.  And then I got the retweet of the picture.  You know what the best thing is, Opie?  Two versions.  Two versions. 
[00:28:00]  Two versions on two different phones.  Two versions.  It makes it even better.  Yeah.  It almost reinforces it, you know?  Hey, E-Rod, can you put it on the big screen, please?  Sure, one second.  On the big screen.  Apple TV in all its glory.  You got to love the Apple TV.  Oh, I know what his plan is, Anthony.  Oh, take a picture of...  Watch this guy.  Right.  A picture of the picture on the screen.  This is fucking Uma Guma now, the Pink Floyd album.  It starts the fucking mindfuck.  This is big.  What's wrong with...  I'm hitting it.  It's staying on that one.  What are you... 
[00:28:30]  Oh, God.  Eric.  That's not me doing it.  Are you bothering your show?  No, no, no.  E-Rock.  Kick us out when you know you.  E-Rock.  Nothing happened to me.  Eric.  Scroll.  You have to scroll.  I'm hitting it.  Apple TV, and it's not doing anything.  Scroll.  There's the greatest hits of E-Rock on the screen.  Why are you scrolling on the remote?  Why is this all about you, E-Rock?  Where's the little remote?  That's not me doing it.  Why is this all about you?  Eric, don't put up pictures of yourself.  Oh, God.  Where's the little silver remote?  Here.  That's his wedding picture.  He's that one.  To do what?  To scroll. 
[00:29:00]  There it is.  It sucks.  Well, that's...  You can't take a small picture and then put it on a big screen.  That ain't gonna work.  Go back to the other one.  Go back to the other one.  I'm honestly starting to worry about the discoloration of this penis.  There's something fucking wrong.  Maybe there's a doctor out there that can look at this.  Look at this.  And save his life.  Let's get Dr. Steve on the phone.  I think we're saving his life.  That's what happened with Bart Giamatti.  There was a picture of him and his nails were very, very thick. 
[00:29:30]  And then he had a heart attack or something right after that.  Right.  And they were saying that that's a sign.  Yeah, that's a sign that his nails are too thick.  Right.  And I have everyone looking at their nails.  Well, you get those thick Opie nails that, you know, they'll kill you.  Yes.  You gotta watch those.  They have nice thin nails.  I gotta get out of here because I got a personal trainer at noon.  I thought you were looking buff.  I'm looking fucking good.  I take pictures of myself in the mirror.  The topless picture was fantastic.  I had underwear on my head, a gun in my waistband, and I was carrying a beer. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Because you know what?  I'm a radio guy.  You can do it.  I can do whatever the fuck I want.  And I was taking it on a cheap hotel mirror.  Yeah.  That's right.  I'm living the life.  Right outside the airport.  Living the life.  Yeah, right outside the airport.  The vacancy sign blinking in the window.  I got a couple more minutes because he has to do you and then he comes and gets me.  Okay.  Well, he's got me parked out on the street.  All right.  So, I did.  All right.  Ronnie, great to see you again.  Okay, buddy.  Good to see you.  It's always a pleasure.  All right.  Pleasure here. 
[00:30:30]  Listen in on the way home.  Thank God I don't know.  Listen to this drivel.  Well, it's not guaranteed that it's over yet.  Sometimes we extend it.  And it's not.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  Keep talking.  I'm listening.  All right.  I'm going to spell.  How do you spell wiener the dirty way?  Same way.  W-E-I-N-E-R.  W-E-I-N-E-R.  All right.  Because I'm.  Wiener.  I'm going right to the source and I'm asking.  You're going to rep wiener.  Yeah.  Rep wiener.  Is this your wiener?  That's brilliant.  I mean, let's go here. 
[00:31:00]  Now you're taking this whole shit to the next level.  And then I'm going to go.  And then I hashtag.  Wieners.  Wiener.  Wieners.  Is it going to be tough to book Breitbart again?  That's all right.  He'll come back.  He'll come back.  We own for the homeless trolley thing.  You know that.  So now we're even Stevens?  Huh?  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  That's my last tweet.  Opie Radio.  Forever?  Yeah.  Why not?  You quit Twitter?  All right.  It's already up on the front page of AOL.  I don't know how they got it.  Wow.  No, I can't.  You got it. 
[00:31:30]  I looked.  A big penis on the front page of AOL.  I fucking looked.  Look at this idiot's dick.  People Magazine just posted it.  That happened really quick.  Wow.  I didn't expect that.  All right.  Ronnie, sorry to budge it on your time.  Not at all.  I haven't seen you in a while, sir.  What about me?  This is the first day I've been here in weeks.  I know.  Are you done?  No.  No.  I've got a couple more weeks to do.  But I...  So you're the guy.  You're one of the guys.  I'm one of the guys.  Twelve angry men. 
[00:32:00]  Could it be one of these trials that go a year?  No.  Mine is grand jury, so you just decide whether the...  You see about...  Oh, that's going to move forward.  Yeah.  Eight or so a day, and then you decide what moves forward, what stays.  And you have to do that for 30 days?  30 days in a hole.  Oh, my God.  30 days in a hole.  I'm a pie.  Very good call.  Radio guy.  No, why?  Because I was having a discussion with someone recently.  I always thought...  Oh, I said it to Warren Haynes.  Warren Haynes loves that song, and he covers it.  I said, I always felt like the Black Crows should have covered 30 days in the hole. 
[00:32:30]  And that's the discussion.  That's actually a good fucking call for them.  Is it?  Yeah.  I think so.  Because that song...  You know, most people don't even know who Humble Pie is.  Well, how about E-Rock fucking put the damn song on?  He doesn't play Beds.  Yeah, see, that would have been a Chris Stanley move.  Chris Stanley...  30 days in a hole.  Have mercy.  E-Rock doesn't play shit.  My favorite part of that song is they're just...  And then all of a sudden you hear the woman laugh.  Come on in.  Like they're going to leave for a second. 
[00:33:00]  Yes, come on in and enjoy.  How did you get out of jury duty today?  Shut up, Sam.  We want to hear 30 days in a hole.  Do people want to know?  Please.  How did you get out of jury duty today?  The adults are talking, Sam.  There'll be time for shit story.  Obviously, the judge was sick.  We all know that.  The judge was sick?  Wait, I want the part where she goes...  Ha ha, come on in.  Isn't that the beginning?  No, I think it pops in as it's...  Wait.  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  On regular radio, you were supposed to cut this part out. 
[00:33:30]  30 days in a hole.  Yeah.  For the days in a hole.  30 days in a hole.  No, I'm in.  Oh, yeah.  Come on in, man.  See?  Yeah, come on in.  Oh, yeah.  Come on in, man.  We got this.  Now we're really kicking the fuck in.  It's about time. 
[00:34:00]  Home of rock and roll?  All right, all right, all right.  I love this song.  I love this song.  Now, are we not supposed to think that this is a Janis Joplin impersonation?  Yeah, no kidding, right?  Who sang that?  I don't know who's singing in here.  I don't know the members.  I just know the song.  Steve Marriott's band.  Peter Frampton, I think, was even in this band for a while.  Really?  Yeah.  What was their other hit?  Or a song people know. 
[00:34:30]  Might start and end with this one.  I think.  For most people.  This is a great fucking song.  This is when, that short era when English guys tried to play the blues.  Yeah.  There was a very short, like, hey, we're blues guys.  We can do this.  Yeah.  We can do this.  We have no history or anything, but we can do this.  All right, Ronnie, I'm done.  All right, brother.  Have a good show.  You take care.  Best of luck with this thing.  The Wiener Gate.  I hope it doesn't explode. 
[00:35:00]  This is going to take you to the next level.  Is it?  Yeah.  Blurry pictures on social networking?  Yeah.  That's how you get it done?  Yes.  Great.  So you go back to Grand Jury tomorrow?  Go back tomorrow, yeah.  I got a question for you.  Why don't you have to be there today?  The fuck I asked a while ago?  Judge is sick.  You know, I told you.  Judge is sick.  I told you.  This is bullshit.  I can't give away any of my cases that I'm in because there's someone's secrecy, but  I had to walk through a bunch of maids the other day screaming, shame on you.  I'm not even going to make it up. 
[00:35:30]  A thousand maids showed up in maid costumes and they were chanting, shame on you.  It was the fucking funniest thing I ever saw in my life.  I saw that in the paper.  You really saw that live?  Yeah.  Oh, that's classic.  Who got them together, though?  They don't have time to...  I guess a union.  The union said, no one go to work today?  Yeah.  Well, there's three shifts of maids, I'm sure.  But the other funny thing is that hotel has decided the way to stop rapes is the maids  are going to wear pants.  And I never...  I would like to rape you, but the pants are slowing me down. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, it's going to take me forever.  It's not easy to get the pants off.  Maybe a belt, too.  You ever been attracted to a maid before?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know why?  They're there.  Yeah, they're female.  If they're close and they're like, hey, you're in here, I'm in here, it's going to fucking  happen.  Right.  It's all set up and ready to go.  All right, Ronnie.  All right.  Take care, my friend.  Absolutely.  A pleasure.  I want to come in and do another set with you soon.  All right.  What about me?  Not you, Sam.  Oh.  Ron Fett is next.  See what I did? 
[00:36:30]  It's nice.  E-Rod didn't pick up on it.  Hang on.  Let's just play the song.  I'm playing it out.  It's less than a minute.  No, you didn't pick up on it.  I swear.  Dirty days in my home.  Dirty days in my home.  Yeah.  Dirty days in my home.  Dirty days in my home.  Dirty days in my home.  E-Rod's talking on my headphones. 
[00:37:00]  Dirty days in my home.  Yeah, you might as well hit the sweeper after this song.  Then Ron and Fez comes on.  Ron and Fez comes on.  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O.N.A. show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  And catch O.P. and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.
