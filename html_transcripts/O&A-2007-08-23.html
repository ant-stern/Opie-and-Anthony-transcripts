<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of their ongoing feud with the Roth Army, a David Lee Roth fan group, escalating to a physical altercation where the show's "pest" slapped someone from the group.  This led to a conversation about aging rock stars and their live performances, comparing artists who maintain their vocal abilities (like Steven Tyler) to those who don't (Robert Plant, Ozzy Osbourne, and David Lee Roth), focusing on altered song arrangements and key changes made to accommodate vocal limitations.  This segwayed into a lengthy discussion of an email from E-Rock detailing a refrigerator door falling off, sparking speculation, including from listeners, about Roth Army involvement.  A picture of E-Rock's chaotic refrigerator contents was described, followed by a discussion of his ensuing problems with Sears.  The show interspersed these discussions with comedic moments, impersonations of aging rockers, jokes about the refrigerator incident, and the recurring "Phone Call Thursday" segment with often trivial listener calls.  Audio clips from a Flavor Flav roast on Comedy Central were played, highlighting the edgy and offensive humor, contrasting it with radio broadcasting limitations.  A bizarre segment featuring audio from a performance art group with disabled individuals also generated considerable amusement and discussion.  The show concluded this section with commentary on a news story about an elderly couple's tragic cross-country cab ride ending in the wife's death, sparking further comedic and somber commentary, along with promotional announcements for future live shows and appearances.

The broadcast continued with one host detailing his voyeuristic activities and subsequent argument with his girlfriend, transitioning to a discussion about a Texas Rangers baseball game with a record-breaking 33 runs.  This led to a discussion of old baseball records, equipment, and the unsafe conditions of early baseball.  A bridge collapse potentially caused by pigeon droppings was also mentioned.  Numerous listener calls followed, covering topics like werewolf facts (including a caller claiming their immortality due to tissue regeneration), a bizarre wolf-killing method, and listener opinions on the sexual appeal of men wearing women's panties. One host recounted trying on women's panties, claiming it was for evidence, while another refused.  Female callers offered their perspectives, emphasizing confidence and uninhibitedness.  UFC light heavyweight champion Rampage Jackson was a studio guest, discussing his career, fighting styles, opponents (including Chuck Liddell), and experiences in Pride Fighting Championships, highlighting differences between Pride and UFC, including referee bias.  He shared anecdotes about injuries, ghostly encounters, and past online videos, including humorous moments about his YouTube videos showing him farting in a girlfriend's face and shopping for athletic supporters. The show also incorporated discussions about Bill Murray's DUI arrest in a golf cart and continued to weave in listener calls.


The Rampage Jackson interview continued into the next segment, delving into his past drug use, his fashion choices to get discounts on crack, and his current life as a father.  Humorous comments about his ankle bracelet ensued.  The conversation shifted to Michael Vick's dogfighting conviction, prompting listener calls, including a comedic misunderstanding of a soundbite.  A "retarded poetry slam, King Gimp style" game using audio clips of a man with a speech impediment was played, proving challenging to decipher. The hosts debated the severity of Michael Vick's actions compared to other athlete transgressions, showcasing varying opinions.  Richard Gere's career was also briefly discussed, along with an uncensored portion of Greg Giraldo's roast of Flavor Flav.

The final segment began with a discussion about book banning, focusing on *Mein Kampf* and O.J. Simpson's book, debating the logic of banning certain books while others remain accessible.  OJ Simpson's financial situation and the public's intense focus on his trial were also addressed.  Comedian Seton Smith, winner of Car Crash Comedy in D.C., called in, followed by a series of prank calls confusing the hosts and callers regarding the 92nd caller prize, involving explicit and offensive language towards a transgender caller.  The conversation returned to Seton Smith, discussing his post-victory experiences and comedy career.  A significant portion focused on Ego McGonigal (also called "Ed" or "McConical"), the Philadelphia Car Crash Comedy winner who backed out of a performance, with his justifications, including claims of Opie and Anthony owing him money, being heavily criticized and mocked.  A new Philadelphia Car Crash Comedy competition was announced to find a replacement.  Kid Chris provided additional details about McGonigal's behavior.  A Journey cover band, Evolution, was briefly mentioned and an audio clip played.  Various listener emails and voicemails, including humorous anecdotes and listener-submitted lines of the day, were shared.  The segment concluded with more banter, upcoming show plans, a future trip to Boston, and recurring jokes about Rich Vossâ€™s breathing into the microphone.

[00:05:00]  the way home yesterday yeah and uh i'm i'm listening to it and listening to roth singing  and going there is no way he is going to sound like that on this tour no way i'm listening to  like running with the devil man and going he can't do that anymore backup singers you think so yeah  it'll be a whole gaggle of backup singers for all the high parts uh they're looking for the sisters as  we speak and he's just going to be going like woo get me three sisters i gotta hit some high notes 
[00:05:30]  and then we go running with the devil and he'll be going woo yeah all right woo running with the devil  running with that devil back backup singers oh yeah absolutely aging rockers go to the sisters to help  them out and they have to do the screen and they have to do that lame choreography where they go  back and forth as they're singing listen to this he could probably do this but 
[00:06:00]  all i've got but then he's gonna go like down  here he goes  that's what it's gonna be yeah come on backup singers and then and he puts the mic out in front of the  crowd yeah running with the devil baby woohoo 
[00:06:30]  running with the devil let me hear everybody say running with the devil  a lot of audience participation you think oh hell yeah some of the tough songs and all those  dopes with their mullets will be like yeah yeah dude and trading stories when they first saw dude  and up vince neal i saw motley crew and they were doing a show with uh the hard rock and he was on 
[00:07:00]  a tour so his voice was wavering a little bit in the middle of a home sweet home every time it was  home sweet the mic went right out to the crowd yeah that was smart tonight tonight i'm on my way  no ain't happening tonight tonight oh sweet home nothing worse than hearing a uh an aged singer just uh  uh totally blowing it just not being able to hit the notes anymore yeah all right prime example is 
[00:07:30]  uh you know bobby plant robert plant just can't do it he wasn't able to do it back in the 70s i don't  know when it when jimmy and i saw him do that uh our confidential what did he do he was pretty damn  good and i gotta tell you but what songs was he doing i don't remember anymore that we saw there  there was new stuff new stuff okay then he did a little zeppelin honestly he didn't sound too bad  was it was it tuned down because i've heard him go been a long time since i rock and roll 
[00:08:00]  i hate when they do that it's like what happened to the like is that a little trick so you know the  business yeah they they tuned down a little bit way down yeah what's that mean tuned down just do  deeper yeah yeah it's like you take uh the original song and where it was and then you take all the  guitars and go and everything gets tuned down so the singer doesn't have to uh sing as high as he  did all right well we uh we invite the spammers you got live robber plant all right let's let's hear 
[00:08:30]  some robber planet uh live okay this was from uh xm yeah yeah 2005 warming up yeah we saw the warm  up for this  okay that's the easy part though  what happened 
[00:09:00]  where's that  oh  oh shut up no i love it no you don't  anyone could do this what happens to way down inside woman you need  see here's what i'm talking about i hear it there that's what i'm talking about because that 
[00:09:30]  that note is really of course it is of course it is  this kid can hold a note uh-oh what  does he feel silly doing this does he feel silly no  all those noises all that guitar weirdness yeah makes me think that he's talking to a hot dog 
[00:10:00]  and then i talked to the hot dog right and it had a face  all right i like when they when they sing weird live no  no you don't i really let me tell you why and and i don't want to hurt you no you're right  you're a fan of ozzy 100 right and i like that i've always loved that since the 80s he cannot sing 
[00:10:30]  live and that never but he's always he blows his voice out drinking and stuff and i would always kind  of like the the because he's dyslexic you'd miss verse verses and screw up lyrics and i i love  that there is nothing more impressive than seeing a band where the singer is sounds exactly like the  recording because then you're like wow this guy didn't know studio tricks he didn't blow out his  voice in uh you know two years uh and it sounds great that's what i like here i'm a fan where  it sounds like 90 90 like the record that you hear on the radio and then they fool around for 
[00:11:00]  maybe 10 of the song now just to give you a little extra because you paid the big uh the you know  price for the extra i that's not a little extra maybe a little extra guitar solo something something  like that maybe extend the song just a little bit the music's one thing but the vocals completely  another i told the story of uh seeing bob dylan back in the day in rochester when i was working up  there first of all the guy never i know he's a legend in the words of jim norton i get it but uh 
[00:11:30]  he didn't acknowledge the crowd didn't acknowledge his amazing backup band that was like paul schaefer and  you know paul schaefer got all these uh musicians together for bob dylan dude man an hour and a half  into the show i didn't recognize one song even though he was playing all the hits yeah we had to  like talk amongst ourselves going i think that's like like a rolling stone but i'm not really sure  completely changed the entire arrangement why do you want to see that to the point where it was  unrecognizable you're going that i hate you're going to see an artist that you enjoy his music and then 
[00:12:00]  they play the songs that you enjoy and they don't sound like the songs that is a it's it's you can't  do it anymore yeah it's like any other job if you get to the point where you can't do it anymore you  gotta go we saw billy joel a few years ago and my agent uh took me and uh bobby kelly backstage  just to say hello really quick and did you get him and bobby kelly confused they're both big fat 
[00:12:30]  messes now yeah and then and billy lost all his hair yeah wow well it was i did drag him away from  the bar so you could get a picture with him well he was this no no this elton john show so it was  like elton was on so he had to go back on right this is like in between his sets you know at the  meadowlands and uh he was he had a bag of fishermen's friends and you know how strong those things are  and he was chewing them one after the other i guess that's how he keeps his voice like fluid or  whatever in between or he keeps it high but he was just chewing them as we all wait what is that 
[00:13:00]  fisherman's friends cough drops oh okay they're really strong cough drops and you suck on them  and if you bite must be a constipated mess those things are supposed to back you up pretty good  yeah he was chomping off drops yeah yeah he really sounded great well there are people like you know um  whether you like the bands or not uh but uh aerosmith you know they when they put on a show they sound  like uh their records well steven tyler still uh steven tyler can still hit notes they got a 
[00:13:30]  backup singer that also plays keyboards that is uh on you know he he's one of the unsung heroes  they put him off to the side he plays the keyboards and has a great voice he does all the high harmonies  over steven tyler's voice you know what i love when you see a legendary band and you see the guy in  the shadows yeah he's not good enough there's someone in the shadows doing a lot though they're doing  everything yeah there's pretty much a lead guitarist you know just off stage and yeah shadows well 
[00:14:00]  aerosmith got into a lot of songs where they were playing uh a lot of there was a lot of keyboard parts  and samples and things like that so they picked up this guy and uh and he sings all the high harmonies  so when you hear all those high high harmonies uh it's this guy right and who he is i don't know hey  i'm hearing sting still hitting the notes i'm hearing please sounds great i'm hearing uh nothing but  good things from the police tour yeah you know the comeback tour they're doing but uh some of the  people hmm oof yeah but anyway to bring it all around we invite uh roth army to spam our phone

[00:24:00]  that they were going to take too long they just canceled it yeah pretty much just because they were they  said well when i called tuesday when this happened they said well they're going to send somebody  between eight and twelve on wednesday i said i can't i'm at work they said all right well then  one to four do you have a time in one to four when they'll come no we don't guarantee a time okay so i  get home and i'm waiting nothing don't hear it for uh don't hear anything 5 30 they call saying oh the

[00:25:00]  door off yeah done already so um so kids don't get stuck inside yeah it was um we all know that but it's  only a year old and it's just a problem with a door hinge yeah how about the refrigerator people put  something inside that a kid could open i mean how it's it's it's 2007 how about there's a latch  in there where if you're stuck there is no latch anymore there's no latch anymore those old refrigerators  that used to go and you actually pulled a latch now it's just a magnetic seal could you get out now 
[00:25:30]  yeah oh you could yeah you just when you open the refrigerator door you're not doing anything  special you're just opening it like in the old days they had a latch but now uh it's just a magnetic  like seal around that that rubber little rubber piece so any kid could get out but you still got  to take the doors off so no little kid crawls in and just goes to sleep and suffocates uh nor from  texas is suggesting that you go to consumerist.com they love this ass and in the end the company  kisses ass the majority of the time consumerist consumerist why didn't you just like get a makita 
[00:26:00]  drill and and drill the hinge back in i mean to have a refrigerator uh well be a little handy i  didn't know how to do that so and that might void the warranty if you start drilling it yeah well what  we did was we propped the door up and had dining room chairs angled at a way to hold the fridge  by the way speaking of the warranty you should have even when it is working  barricaded scott m from hop hog uh eric probably avoided the warranty by opening the door 4500 times 
[00:26:30]  a day yeah you know how they test these things they put them on machines and open and close the  door a million times and you broke it you could be a tester i bet you like he'd walk into the kitchen  and the refrigerator door just fly up and go i know i know take something oh someone's suggesting that  you call seven on your side oh or that creep with the dumb mustache the shame shame shame shame 
[00:27:00]  that uh arnold diaz i hate arnold diaz that that kill that do-gooder but in ski he is a but in ski  he's a snitch he's a nerd he's a nerd well yeah that door is like a camera crew i think you're gonna  have to take some weight off the door they're right you rock that thing is full uh i i would  post that picture because i think the uh people uh could photoshop that pretty pretty good i think 
[00:27:30]  there should be some pretty funny stuff i think the the picture is already up on the website right  yes just grab that and photoshop a lot of people are amazed that you didn't try to fix it yourself  yeah not not too handy and i'm with anthony i mean it seems like you would know that the door's ready  to go because both hinges got have to go yeah wasn't it getting a little shaky it didn't seem that way  no i had opened it as soon as i got home of course you opened it as soon as you got home as  the screws as the screws were getting loose did the door seem like it wasn't squared up with the 
[00:28:00]  refrigerator no it was actually the the suction yeah the suction would be fine but it wasn't like  tilted like a little more space on the bottom than on top or no huh it did i i didn't notice it  just ripped out without even being touched no it's just the oddest thing i was uh on the computer and  all of a sudden you just hear this loud crash and went into the kitchen there what do you think it  was honestly i didn't know refrigerator door falling off or the roth army coming through your front door

[00:35:00]  and i say technically because it's on your it's it's on your tv just like a local station would be  but that doesn't matter it's because it has nothing to do with um fcc which well they put out a bunch of  the curses and stuff but they just do that for sponsors they left in the s-bomb yeah they left  in a couple s-bombs but the material itself if you did it on the radio you'd be fired yeah you'd be  fired absolutely the racial stuff you would be they they were uh goofing on uh flavor and uh all the 
[00:35:30]  other uh black rappers that were there and just pure race racial humor good it was funny really  funny but uh you can't do it there are a few references on the radio nappy headed blank because  if i say it then there's a there's an outrage but there's all sorts of references to that the  actual n-word was being thrown around like it was the word the yeah they left it on or beep it oh 
[00:36:00]  they of course beat it of course but they're saying it right you know what it was and this  is what jimmy kimmel had to say flavor slave i've gotten to know him he has a large wonderful  family he has um was it seven kids or eight kids seven you sure seven kids with 14 different women  and and he's hoping you're hoping to have 10 three more right that's right his kids names are  desina kwan shaneek william and karen go figure kayla and karma and he has two grandsons too and they 
[00:36:30]  each have four children and they each have two grandsons flavor slave is responsible for more  homeless black children than hurricane patrina  nice right joke nice funny joke nice that's funny but radio guys we're too scared to go down 
[00:37:00]  that road because you know they can't do it there's people out there that'll get you in trouble and  and they'll blog it yeah this will end up on a blog and then kimmel had this to say at the end  of the night tonight um we're gonna hold you down and give you a vasectomy just for the good of the  human race chris benoit is a better father than funny good for you you dummies in the audience  groaning even rosa getting soft what a great joke whoa right oh oh chris benoit wow kimmel's got 
[00:37:30]  balls man no kidding he couldn't he went right for it yeah that's great funny joke and he has more  loose than anyone i mean he's on you know he's a network talk show he's not some he's not some  middle from like you know long island who's trying to make it big yeah he's legitimate he's got a real  gig and i said god bless him i you know but you do some of this stuff on the radio you don't know  you don't know if someone's gonna blog you good for him and send it into the drudge report

[01:06:30]  what we're looking at right now i shut the thing right off because i could care less i could i could  get that anywhere there's just something about a girl in bed naked and and you know a booby pops  are popping out from under the covers because it's like it's like you're there look okay look i'm gonna  i'm gonna go sideways here i'm gonna tilt my there there we go there now i'm sideways she's laying 
[01:07:00]  down look it's almost like i'm laying there you're gonna feel a booby boop boop boop boop boop boop  kevin from connecticut on pal talk opi is a voyeur i'm absolutely a voyeur love the voyeurism  love voyeurism got in trouble got in trouble with the girl last night because uh we got a building that's  very close to ours and uh man there's a show going on i told you about my nephew and niece  checking out uh you know young kids bathing young kids checking out young kids bathing there was 
[01:07:30]  something really creepy about that especially when uh my uh niece yelled for her father to check it out  with her and i'm like i think that i think there's something wrong with this whole thing i'm not  really sure why it's creepy yeah when the whole family when there's kids bathing and the whole family  pulls out binoculars yeah it's not no binoculars yet jimmy that's why i got in trouble because last night i'm  checking out the windows i'm like yeah that window down there that's where that's where the mommy was  showering uh when uh you know jamie and uh jd were here whoopsie and then i'm like and look what's 
[01:08:00]  going on there they're making dinner there and uh and there's a dog walking around that apartment  and i go you know what we need binoculars my hoops i need to see this better right what do you mean  you need binoculars ah just saying so we can you know get a better look at this building  gotta make sure everything's on the up and up over there she comes into the living room at three  in the morning there's like binoculars and a drilled out cantaloupe all right what else is  america talking about today well i'll tell you what they're talking about rangers scored 30 runs 
[01:08:30]  last night in a baseball game 30 runs a modern day record they call it uh yeah what was the final score  uh rangers 33 to three the rangers were losing three nothing after uh the third inning and then  they end up scoring 30 runs wow and then what do they win 30 to three or something like that yeah  what was the final score 33 30 to 3 it was the night embarrassing this is what i found interesting 
[01:09:00]  it was the ninth time a major league team scored 30 runs the first is the chicago  colts ah the old chicago colts this is how old this record is not since the chicago chicago colts  set the major league mark in a 36 7 route of louisville louisville  in a national league game on june 28th 1897 
[01:09:30]  that that shouldn't even be a stat the chicago colts once you go beyond the 1900  it's it's ancient history it's that's like so old that it doesn't even have any relevance on what  we do today but now we're into the 20 hundreds so now the 1900s don't matter no the 1900s still kind  of matter because i don't know you know the 1900s jesus we were just there a little while ago but i mean  that that stuff is that's that's ancient history shouldn't even come up they were playing in ballparks 
[01:10:00]  with like the wood with the ads for cigarettes elixirs and cigarettes and farm equipment  1897 were they using gloves well i'm sure they weren't using face masks they couldn't figure that  one out no little fat gloves they always had like with the big fat palm like midget hands they would  have like yeah midget hands over their hands they weren't much bigger than a regular glove no you ever  watch espn classic yeah like i i especially like watching really old hockey games when instead of 
[01:10:30]  like the plexiglass around the the uh the the rink they had like chain link fence and then they show  the goalies without a face mask and you're like why didn't anyone back then figure out that it's not  a good idea to shoot pucks at a guy that doesn't have any face protection maybe the goalie very least  should have a face mask there's an old glove that's an 1897 glove and then you look at like old  baseball gloves yeah there you go there's a perfect example like how do you catch a ball with 
[01:11:00]  that no one could figure out that there was a better way way back then it looks like just a  giant glove that you'd wear to keep warm right it's like a big fat hand big fat hand glove yeah  many broken fingers must have resulted out of those horrendous gloves but i look at this old equipment  and and you think to yourself why couldn't they figure out something like better even back then  right away they couldn't even figure out lights they had to play in the middle of the afternoon  yeah just awful well they had to wait for the lights to be invented though yeah all right  good point good point enough so there you go chicago uh colts who knew i'm sure they know in 
[01:11:30]  chicago i didn't know they're yeah the team used to be called the chicago colts  there's a a pigeon or something on the camera for uh jill nicolini doing the traffic and the  pigeon and it looks like a vulture ready to peck at her yeah on the outdoor traffic camera also what  else is america talking about today well uh you hear about the bridge collapse obviously uh over  the mississippi river river what again well now they're saying that it could be uh pigeon crap 
[01:12:00]  oh yeah yeah how how are they it corrodes the uh metal how big of a bird was that  uh pounded and strained by heavy traffic and weakened by missing bolts and cracking steel  the failed interstate bridge over the mississippi river also faced a less obvious enemy pigeons  inspectors began documenting the buildup of pigeon dung on the span near downtown minneapolis two decades 
[01:12:30]  ago experts say the corrosive guano uh deposit all over the interstate 35w spans framework helped the steel  beams rust faster pigeon dung could have been one of the causes of the bridge collapse  we all have to die and dying i'm sure sucks but i just hope when it's my time to go it's not because  of a pigeon dump pigeon dung well their droppings contain ammonia and acids said chemist blah blah 
[01:13:00]  blah blah blah an officer with the health and blah blah blah blah blah if the dung isn't washed away  it dries out and turns into a concentrated salt when water gets in and combines with the salt and  ammonia it creates a small uh a small electrochemical reactions that rust the steel underneath  why why would anyone know that why would any scientist look at that and go i i have to find out  what's in it wipe it up because they're not uh you know getting laid they gotta clean if they  gotta do something with their time you know that really isn't information you can use when you're 
[01:13:30]  when you're out with a girl you're trying to get laid and you hey do you know before you wipe the  windshield off he has to tell you about it you know what's in that uh nathan in california sorry  to interrupt but you know we got werewolf facts coming in nathan what's up hey buddies uh just wanted  to let you know that werewolves are virtually immortal because of the constant regeneration of their physical  tissue thus making their true age somewhat difficult to determine hmm interesting let's go to burn in 
[01:14:00]  new york burn hey what's up guys hey wolfman has nards they have nards  nards geez that's from an awful movie what movie monster monster monster squad how do you know that  it i remember the line it's awesome it's awesome let's go with uh mongo the trucker mongo  morning you sure that uh that report pigeon report wasn't about eric's door falling off  uh eric was there pigeon dung on your hinge 
[01:14:30]  one more or your dung yeah i'm thinking his uh chris in maine what's up uh this is about wolves you  can kill a wolf by putting a knife blade first into the ground sprinkling some blood on it  the wolf will smell the blood start licking the blade and bleed to death  michael vick might know that one maybe maybe the uh werewolf acting wasn't a good  i don't think that was a werewolf i think he was talking about a wolf yeah 
[01:15:00]  like a real wolf no i'm gonna tear down a wall here today what i was trying to get at you know how  those kids were talking about werewolf like i like to make werewolf movies and they were just doing  weird crap i was hoping we would go to the calls and they would just do that type of thing no they  would kind of imitate all that stuff they heard earlier then you'd had a way of said you're looking  for retarded werewolf facts well not even facts the same facts is bad yeah you're i want to go the 
[01:15:30]  phone and just hear something like i like to make werewolf movies just werewolf comments or and it  doesn't even have to be comments i like i'm not saying it because it'll be in a promo see i'm  getting smarter yeah women's panties ah see now if you put the two together see but they can't make  a promo unless they edit but i think they could edit that yeah would you wear a woman's panties  ever seriously no i don't know if i would i'm not even kidding i'm not trying to be funny i mean  honestly i might i thought you had i had one time in a sexual encounter but i mean if a woman wanted 
[01:16:00]  me to have might i don't know it's not gay if you if it's something you're doing because you like  women it's not yeah i think i think it would take the uh i think it would just uh turn into silliness  if you did that like what are you going to get done if you got panties it'll turn into a session  with yourself a session what do you mean because it would be all silky smooth yeah exactly i'm saying  i wouldn't wear them with my stomach like this you have to be in perfect shape if you're a guy and  you're going to wear a woman's panties and try to turn her on my fat gut my appendix scar but 
[01:16:30]  that's what i'm getting at how do you wear women's panties and then turn on a woman i don't know  women are filth bags too yeah how does that turn on a woman you would have to be in good shape we  might have to ask the ladies today how does that turn you on i can only guess it's the way you look  at them see i look at all right you put the panties on and then you look kind of silly and then like  your your girl's just laughing at you it's the stuff that's there that isn't there when a woman wears it  yeah and the feeling of it that she would like i think she would like that yeah yeah 
[01:17:00]  i've been asked a few times to do that and i refuse a few times yeah why don't you  because i'd look silly so what i'd love to be asked i'm not gonna do that who asked you uh girlfriend  more than one girlfriend uh yeah yeah what kind of little life body do you have that more than one  girl said that would look good female underpants anyone else hoping he was going to say his mom  i would love that yes that's one of the women that asked me when she's on that drug that she took that

[01:19:30]  yeah i don't think so fans got something on this doing 110 down a freeway in la fox was filming it  yeah that would be shocking but yes then no that you you are allowed to drive golf carts here in  in sweden in this situation here in sweden in this situation okay so you know yeah i mean what's the big  deal bill murray rules absolutely metal leg uh but the trivia band huh there's yugo that's him right  there yeah he looks just like steve perry in that clip isn't it ridiculous even that guy wow she goes

[01:31:30]  yep yeah the title from chuck liddell does our show all the time we we like chuck i like  chuck we had him in uh right after uh yeah you did a number on him oh no why y'all do that well  he's he's all right with it you know he he knows he's a good sport man yeah i really like chuck you  know what i'm saying that's that's on the real what when when you fight someone like chuck now  chuck's got a hell of a reputation but uh with with the public but now all you guys on the inside 
[01:32:00]  kind of know a little more about each other than i think the public does do you see chuck as being  maybe a little a little older and and you had kind of the the edge on him uh during that fight  no i just i just uh know that styles make fights and anyway and i wish all my opponents fought like  chuck really yeah but they don't well he's like a wild thrower it seems like because he's and i'm  certainly no expert on on fighting technique but he even said on the show he threw one punch that his 
[01:32:30]  his his guys had said don't throw it and you certainly took advantage of it yeah yeah that's that's  that's my style you know what i'm saying somebody make a mistake i like to capitalize on it well you  certainly it was weird because like you're the one guy chuck can't beat chuck was on a thing he  wanted to beat the three guys that had beaten him yeah and for some reason i was watching the promos  for the fight uh where you're talking and he's talking i'm like i like chuck this is going to be a  tough one no when the fight started did you think at any time that that you you were in trouble at 
[01:33:00]  any time or did you feel i got this guy under control i know what he's all about did you see the  fight yeah yeah did i look like i was in trouble not at all but believe me not at all but it's just  that kind of i think chuck's got this uh stigma around him that you know that he's he's very badass  yes yes and very intimidating i think but that doesn't affect you well i i don't get intimidated  no really you know i'm not looking at you i don't see how he should right i just go out there and do my 
[01:33:30]  job you know so if i get my ass whooped i got my ass whooped i shake the guy's hand man good job  you with my ass you know what i'm saying so you know you go win or you go lose that's the way it  go yeah well you're from pride i mean you came up in pride in japan uh and those guys seem to be  doing very well in the ufc uh some some some of us are you know saying anderson silver you know took  the belt and stuff like that uh some of us doing pretty well and and pride is it's a tougher fight  but when you come over to the ufc you know saying these guys they up in the end because they know 
[01:34:00]  you know that we we went to battle with some why is pride tougher than the ufc i think uh because we  fight a lot more international people people from all over the world and some people they they fight  for their country like you fight some brazilian dude they you know you you know they fight for  their country they do anything to win and then a lot of times you got to fight the referees in japan too  because the referee got their favorites you know what i'm saying river you might be kicking a dude's ass on  the ground and the referee like ah stand up like oh you know what the hell you got to fight your 
[01:34:30]  opponent and the referee in japan well gonzaga was a brazilian he was i think he might still be a  brazilian you're absolutely right good point good point rampage he has certain times you think guys  are in unbeatable like you look at i'll watch a guy fight and think there's no way that someone's  going to beat this guy and then i watched him against uh a crow cup yeah oh and he destroyed miracle  krokop he destroyed him he krokop wasn't used to the cage and he wasn't used to those elbows and  kind of threw him off and i looked exactly what's going on and he kicked krokop in the head just like 
[01:35:00]  krokop kick it that's bad that's what's great about ufc it's it's like you just don't know what  situation any of these guys any of you guys are going to get in with another guy you know you could  be kicking ass and then some guy comes in and has some weird friggin thing that he yeah it grew up  doing yeah the ufc that's why it's so great you could be kicking somebody's ass and and and and  then next thing you know he he submits you or something yeah you know he catches with some  knock you out he choked you get locked up in something you're going ah damn my arm that's 
[01:35:30]  crazy anything can happen it's all real anything can happen i know when i used to fight in taekwondo  tournaments under the green belt division shut up okay go no no no you can you can talk  whatever you want daniel's son but don't try to relate on like like two two men of similar ilk  discussing fighting that's stopping all of us i used to take track home taekwondo you can't even say  it if you can't say it how are you ever use this um who is oh my god silva is a guy i think he's uh 
[01:36:00]  he's beaten you twice yeah he beat me twice you've never beaten him right uh thank you no no no i'm not  i'm not rubbing salt in the wood i'm saying like it sounds like it no no i'm about to see you after  after this show oh damn why why jimmy's been working the heavy bag i think uh you might have  a shot i slapped the heavy bag like a girl i actually go down with a dress and i slap it like  duck the first time i fought still was actually after the first time i fought chuck the same night 
[01:36:30]  and and it was a tournament i had to fight chuck then i had to fight the champion of japan  and you know what i'm saying it was it was it was tough to fight two great fighters in one night  is he a guy you want another crack at oh hell yeah because like i said you know he's one of the  guys that i know i can beat you know both times i was beating him and then like the referee told me  nah you ain't the one that we want to win you know what i'm saying and that's over in in japan if i  get him in the ufc it ain't gonna be none of that because in ufc everything's real everything's fair  the referees they don't they don't care who wins they you know so they call the fight like they call 
[01:37:00]  they stop it when they stop it you know they stand it up when when it's time to stand it up it's not  so much uh politics like in japan you know who has hit you the hardest you've ever been hit i think  uh maybe kevin random and he's another guy that uh beat crow cup yeah man there's a frightening he's  like a more of a traditional wrestler yeah yeah he's a really good wrestler why do you say he hit  you the hardest because um he uh he hit me the hardest no but what how do you know that because what did 
[01:37:30]  did he knock you out no he didn't knock me out but uh but um i remember going damn yeah i remember  yeah i was like i was like whoa because sometimes when you get knocked out of them necessarily means  it's a real true yeah they just got you just got you but uh kevin random hit me in the right spot  and i remember i went down and i still had my hands up that was kind of crazy if he would have jumped  on me he probably would have knocked me out but he didn't know he was surprised that he hit me so hard  himself he just stood there and watched and praise god that went down that way well you beat him in the  first round didn't you yeah i beat him in the first round i had to get him out of there because he 
[01:38:00]  hit me the hardest yeah yeah that's that's the difference between like there's a world we can't  relate to these men like the guy silver beat him and he's like i can't wait to get him in the ring  again and yet if somebody beat me all i would do for the rest of my life is avoid them  i would make excuses and avoid them and duck them and fake injuries but this is what you got to know  you got to understand you know what i'm saying it's probably that day you know so you're probably  just off that day you know i don't want to make excuses but i know the second time i fought a 
[01:38:30]  silver you know it wasn't my day you know so i probably shouldn't even fought but you know  i'm a fighter so a lot of times i i take fights like when i fought chuck the second time i had a  fractured wrist you know so i'm like you know i gotta take this fight i fractured my wrist three  weeks before the fight it's about it's a gamble you know saying sometimes a lot of times when i fight  and i lose it's a big reason you know saying like man i know i should have took that fight but  it's a gamble you know a lot of times we fight injured do you get nervous before you go in like  are you like a mess i'm not a mess but i get nervous yeah does the crowd have anything to do 
[01:39:00]  with it or it's just the fight it's just the fight it's just um it's a lot of times like i don't want  i don't i don't want to be a make a boring fight i get nervous about that or i don't want to lose you  know i'm in front of my some friends say my parents are there i don't want to lose for my coach  it's nervous and like that it's never a fear of getting my ass whooped just i i want to do it  good i want to put on a good show i want to make people proud because this type of nervous like  like you know you're nervous at a wedding you you don't want to say the wrong thing you know yeah  you don't want to tell that bad party party story when you're like toasting the groom yeah 
[01:39:30]  never saw a donkey do that here's to you yeah the wrong thing i do uh is there any jewish fighters  i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure there's some fighters out there that look that look jewish to me yeah  after they got punched in the nose i'm talking about i'm pretty sure there are some jewish fighters  out there yeah they practice taekwon take your dough that was a good one taekwon take your dough  jiu-jitsu 
[01:40:00]  i should have said jiu-jitsu but i tried to put jiu-jitsu oh he put the jew in jiu-jitsu  jimmy likes to work out there rampage uh why don't you tell him about your swim walking  just one man talking to another man about working out i know i just a little what you  brag about it when when i swim walk it's the thing i i have a bad ankle so like i would probably you  and i would probably similar workouts but my ankle i injured i tripped why don't you give a little  demonstration yeah why don't you show rampage jackson your swim walk technique yeah well it might help 
[01:40:30]  him out in his work yeah you never know you could be trading something all right this is jimmy he  really does this rampage guys know that what's going to happen is you're probably going to take  this and market it as your own and you can have it what i do is as i walk around and my arms going  can i just explain it to him no you have to do it yeah all right yeah i'm not i promise i won't take  it okay you can have it this uh it helps the hound the pound just kind of peel away all right you just  kind of walk here's what you do like that i promise you i won't steal that yeah i don't think there's 
[01:41:00]  any worry in stealing that one no worry no worries you can have that if you if you drill a hole in the  wall he'll show you his neck exercise what's a neck what's a neck exercise exercise what's an  exercise hey man what's wrong with you what's wrong with you man he's an adult he's taking a lot of  shots of the head obviously rampage oh what's his name rich voss rich voss what's wrong with you 
[01:41:30]  we've been asking that same question what's wrong with you he's punch drunk  what about out out on the street uh people try to like challenge you because i i know that's kind  of a problem for a few of you guys like people are hey you know they get a couple of beers in them if  you're out and think that they're uh you know tough guys and they're gonna yeah they used to go after  tyson back in the day yeah because tyson tyson is worth millions you know what i'm saying you you  get punched by tyson man you can buy your whole business is that why they were doing that i think  come on now yeah you know and they never looked at it that way but i'm too but i'm too cool with 
[01:42:00]  everybody most times people get to meet me and stuff they're like oh they just want to talk and  and that's probably i wish i would have punched them then they won't talk in my ear off yeah just shut  up i think the one you're boring me ass wham i think the one thing people don't know about  you is you got a sense of humor we've been looking at your youtube videos this morning  oh there's one of you uh farting in a girl's face oh god damn yeah what is she gonna do man look at  this i was young as hell back then but it's up there you know people check it out that's funny 
[01:42:30]  damn i'm never doing anything else on camera again see look when i did that there was no such  thing as youtube yeah there was no such thing as youtube you never thought this would just be  available yeah back in the day you would just do this for fun and now some some somebody will just  some nerd yeah we'll just throw it up on youtube and now everyone checks it out oh repeat over and  over rampage jackson farts in girl's face that's the search that was my ex-girlfriend oh that was in 
[01:43:00]  japan that was in japan she didn't speak no english that's universal yeah the funniest thing  no translated needed yeah i told her i told her the english i wanted her to say you know oh no she  was a japanese girl walking around what's up my nigger she thought that was good morning  so she was she was sending to everybody white folks like oh i'm not i'm not a nigger 
[01:43:30]  she didn't know no better it was funny there's a there's another video you uh you're shopping for  i guess an athletic supporter and uh you keep saying it's a little too small because you're very  well endowed and you're telling this uh i don't know what you're talking about this little uh japanese  girl you're trying to explain it to her and then you start showing yo what's up with your grill  what's with your choppers her teeth was was throwing gang signs 
[01:44:00]  i got a lot of crap for that a lot of a lot of my fans got mad at me  you know what i'm saying they they you don't say messaged me like uh how could you be so cruel  and blah blah blah i'm like you know what man it's you know yeah i got a big gap of my  too you know people make fun of my teeth screw that that was yeah one of your teeth that was some  of my friends they know yeah what's up with your grill did you see her grill though for real  something something's wrong with her grill for real i was wondering because you know you go to japan  i love japanese people you know so i have two japanese kids and i love them you know saying but 
[01:44:30]  there's something wrong with their teeth over there and i think you know you know how like people  construction men construction workers they went to uh you know uh to new orleans they help out with  katrina we need to send some dentists over there and i think they can make money you know  they're the dentist uh the search is rampage trying to buy a jock strap it is really really funny  are you are you a fan of comedy yeah yeah i like comedy you know i always have been yeah a fan of 
[01:45:00]  comedy you know it's classic what's wrong with your grill what a great way to talk about somebody's  awful teeth you know she didn't understand what i was saying no if she had understood what i was saying  i probably wouldn't have done it but you know yeah i used to do my own behind the scenes thing  because my friends figured out that i'm so stupid that you know maybe they can you know make some  funny footage of me you know if they started videotaping me so i had some friends videotaping  me but the bad thing about that is and i started getting into it a little bit too much too because  i wouldn't do it whether a camera there or not most of the stuff i've done the crazy stuff you guys 
[01:45:30]  would never see there's no camera around yeah yeah but then my friends they started doing i started getting  to it then i started getting serious about it then we started getting fighting my friends because the funny  stuff i started doing they'd be filming themselves or they a nice looking girl walk by they got the  camera on her butt or something so i'm like i'm gonna stop doing it because i'm getting to fight  with my friends because they're not getting the funny stuff how about now you have endorsements and  stuff you do because right now it's got to be tough with endorsements you're going to watch what you  do because they'll yank your endorsements yeah yeah like boost mobile told me you know what i'm saying  i better be cool and toyot tires and stuff like that my sponsor throw down they said man yeah you got to be 
[01:46:00]  you got to be straight don't be beating nobody up and stuff like that and so you know i i i i gotta be cool  and you know they say they go whoop up on me if you saw yeah you have no fear of a guy like tyson do  you no no tyson's a real cool guy why i fear tyson see that's that's how a man discusses tyson he's a  cool guy i don't his personality would mean nothing to me if he was punching me in the face but these  guys are amazing because like there's no standing eight count in the ufc it's like the minute you show 
[01:46:30]  weakness all right well i'm gonna break your arm or you're gonna you're gonna tap yeah yeah that's what  that's what makes the sport so safe though you know it's all about safety as well because you  know in the beginning and the ufc kind of had like a bad rep you know saying the the old owners of the  ufc that they they they did a good job but they really didn't know what they was doing they was  you know brandon is the you know the dangerous the gore is the bloodiest thing and that you know  now it's evolved a lot into you know saying a sport and and it's really safe now it's very safe i'll let  i'll let my kids do it when they grow up we we said this when chuck was in it's making boxing uh look 
[01:47:00]  ridiculous as far as the sport goes i can't watch a boxing match anymore no i'd much rather watch ufc  i had a tough time watching the early years of ufc but now oh and they used to get him down now i can  finally watch and the elbows you get the elbows across the nose and the ref wouldn't step in yeah  i mean this would just be a bloody pulp of a face left yeah i don't know what they told the refs back  in the day but and they they a lot of them was inexperienced back and i used to watch it uh back back 
[01:47:30]  now like yeah i saw one dude get his face you know crushed and and and then uh they they canceled  the ufc and stuff they wasn't on tv or something yeah yeah but then they they changed everything  and it's safe i'll tell you you know i read a i really get like uh this you know little bumps and  bruises and you know little hurt and no elbows and stuff every night and then uh head trauma you  know a lot of boxes can't even talk these days you know yeah it's and it's still you know just action  packed you know you don't get these a lot of times in boxing when they start clenching and grabbing on 
[01:48:00]  man you they lose me you know yeah it's just non-stop action if if one guy's getting tired  he's gonna lose you know he's gonna get his ass kicked yeah but i still like watching bucks like  ricky hadden and and um and mayweather and sugar shane mose i still like watching fighters i like i like  watching a couple of like like mexican flyweights come out and just hands going like like wings  yeah they're just pummeling each other the whole time that's what i like so there's a lot of the 
[01:48:30]  heavyweight uh bouts i can't i can't get lazy or something sometimes you don't see you don't see  too many knockouts and stuff you don't even see people hitting the canvas that much anymore yeah but  you know like ufc they probably had like what seven eight fights you know somebody will get their  ass kicking in one of those seven eight fights you're gonna see some good you know a good show  are you scared of anything i'm scared of ghosts i don't like for real yeah i don't like we're just  talking about ghosts yesterday yeah we're talking about that i don't want to see one have you ever  seen a ghost or felt like you you're in a haunted house or anything i felt like that before i i kind 
[01:49:00]  of like uh i pray to god that you know i don't see no ghosts but i i've i had some type of crazy  experience i was like spending night with some friend's house and it was years ago when i was fighting in  japan and man i couldn't i tried to wake up using the restaurant i couldn't get up then you know it  was it was like a big deal i was like whoa i couldn't move then the next morning i you know i  told the people and they said uh they said uh yeah you that's kind of weird because the bed you're  sleeping in the bed my you know my grandmother died in oh oh thanks oh what the hell that's exactly 
[01:49:30]  what we're talking about the other day yeah i wanted to smack everybody in the house yeah i just  never spent a night over there then another time the same thing happened again i was on one of my  friends house and he like used to do my website and stuff and i crashed i passed out then you know  i tried to get up and stuff like that and all i could do was shake my leg and then and i and i try  to call his name and it happened for like 30 seconds then i said hey hey man you know what this happened  to me i was trying to call you man i was shaking my leg trying to get your attention all right you  know i couldn't move and then and then he said all right he blew it off but then i heard him talking 
[01:50:00]  like a couple of weeks later he was saying how he had a part of his house and one of his friends got  murdered there i'm like man i'm thinking this one got something to do with each other man but you  can't get up from a dead grandmother holding you down i'm not the toughest guy in the world but a dead  grandmother he tapped out hey go walk over there and tell us hey hey hey what are what are you talking  about i heard when a ghost sit on your chest you can't move in the south we say something like that  can i tell you though i have that what you're talking about which is where your head is like 
[01:50:30]  you feel your head and you want to move and you want to talk and you can't yeah you're completely  aware what that is is it's a night paralysis i get that all the time i mean i live with that is that  from your swimming uh exercises swim walking it tuckers me out yeah no what that is is it's like  you're waking up in a weird way and your body that's a safety mechanism your body has so you don't  injure yourself when you sleep uh in your dreams so you don't do too much uh when you sleep it paralyzes  you at one point oh that's what it is not a ghost yeah no what about what about the second time 
[01:51:00]  when i really wasn't sleep i was just laying yeah that was a ghost but the first time  yeah we were talking about when you're staying in a hotel room or an old house you don't know  what's gone on in that place it could have been like you said murders and stuff and and you get  like a creepy feeling and yeah i do not want to see that and no matter if it could be the nicest  smiling ghost bringing me cookies and i'll go i would lose my mind it's crazy my friend uh told  me a lot of ghost stories he's taiwanese and stuff like that and he stayed at one his friend's house 
[01:51:30]  and he saw this white lady walk by you know there's two asian guys and he's like hey man when did you  get a maid or something he's like what are you talking about i ain't got no maid oh man then the  guy put two two games oh you saw the ghost that lives in my house he just said it casually like yeah  like goodbye so long time to sell sell sell he see a lot of ghosts in taiwan you know there's a lot of  it was like a lot of wars or something over there and he's one he he see a lot of ghosts i like man so you  believe in ghosts i know there's ghosts but i'm scared of them you know if i can't if i can't 
[01:52:00]  i'm scared you know what about like the devil and stuff like that you get nervous no he wouldn't  be scared of the devil he would just no i mean do you but like do you get oh my god who wouldn't  be scared of the devil rich i'm saying you're scared of ghosts what's wrong with you what's wrong with  you man wait listen to me listen to me i know there's a lot of ghosts hey what we have this we have to  take a break you want to hang yeah yeah yeah we like rampage rampage jackson great what are we uh  what are we promoting today rampage can i i he's uh ufc 74 is saturday night it's a 10 10 pm pay-per-view

[01:55:00]  has posters up on his walls you've got a great sense of humor man we like you let's say hi to  red in jersey red what's up oh not much i just want to say you're the greatest rampage and the  boys there want to ask you a question uh you ever put on panties for a woman no no did you hear us  talking about that yeah no i didn't hear you i couldn't hear you and i was in the room but now  i don't put on panties for no woman see we got into this discussion like uh some women saying this is  cool for a man to put on panties in front of them and uh and we i don't find it sexy but no you know 
[01:55:30]  what they they you know what women try to do they try to manipulate men so they can say oh he i could  tell him to do anything next thing you know they could be behind you with a dildo  that's a good day  you can say it again what is wrong with you we've been trying to figure that out for years  rampage you're only you're only there's only something wrong with you if she slaps your face 
[01:56:00]  with it and you like it like you've crossed the line well jimmy once you were you were talking about  the panty thing earlier you once you'd like to try to explain somebody used the same thing that that  he just said which is that woman will try to make you do that but i one girl asked me to do it but we  were in the i can't say it on the radio but we were in the middle of very very kinky behavior and i did  it while we were engaging in this behavior and uh she was i can't tell you what a filth bag she  turned into she turned into just a dirty dirty but if it was her on the world you already had them 
[01:56:30]  oh no no they were hers and you fit into them thank you thank you  i was just gonna say this has been a big girl  she turned into a dirt bag no we liked him because no she had a nice little body on her but i i i just  looked so masculine in them because i bulged through them that was well that's your truth  one halloween stretch them out yeah one halloween i dressed like a a girl and i had this dress on  and uh and uh pantyhose yeah we're buying the whole oh yeah like okay it's true yeah in april 
[01:57:00]  whatever it was a late halloween but girls were all over me at the party man when you're dressed  up like a girl listen to me i'm telling you can close a deal like that once you look at rampage  and say yeah yeah rampage where we come from we don't do that yeah all right hey we got an expert  on the line dr jessica uh dr jessica hello boys hi you're gonna explain why women like guys and  panties well i don't i don't have the medical explanation but i think you know in some cases 
[01:57:30]  kind of like gender bending and gender like androgyny can be really hot like david bowie  scott wyland um it's just sexy to have no hang-ups and just kind of like go close to that line where you  don't know what's really going on and and play in that zone um i don't know like a lot of open-mindedness 
[01:58:00]  on the part of the guy and i actually was gonna say i know jimmy would probably  want to play with a little toy back there  in all honesty no um i've had and it's not out of being homophobic it's just not a sensation that  i crave i had one dominatrix almost do it man you guys honest as hell in vegas she almost did it in  vegas and um i kind of backed out because it was just 200. she used another term you really should 
[01:58:30]  back out in that situation i forwarded out there you go  and uh i said no i just it just all of a sudden kind of like struck me like that this is not going  to be this is not this is going to be uncomfortable is it gay if a girl does it to you is it gay if you  do it to yourself i mean it depends on what you're watching you know if you're watching you know let 
[01:59:00]  me tell you something if you're enjoying fighting that if you're enjoying that sensation you have  some kind of a homo erotic enjoyment of of that type of thing it's gay i'm gonna tell you why women  like for you to dress up in pants in a nutshell yeah i think it's i think i think i think so if  you're letting somebody play with your your exit hole is gay right that's my opinion that's my  opinion and opinions yeah hold on woman lets a guy play back there is she gay hell no no because 
[01:59:30]  that's you're a woman you're a woman you know what nothing's supposed to go in back there on women  either see i'm with rampage and i'm with anthony but every time we have this discussion on our show  the guys come out of the woodwork saying the opposite the complete opposite and you'll get some  you know men calling like hey i'm uh bill i'm a construction worker i don't think it's gay i'm  gonna say this and i can't i swear to god we could take calls for the next half hour because  and that's that's one of the one things that uh doing this show for many years with anthony that  amazed me because we go down this road every once in a while and these phones will light up with guys 
[02:00:00]  that swear to god they're straight and they don't mind that type of activity i have to say this from a  woman obviously i dated a girl years ago who also used to hook up with a fighter i can't say his name  but he was not a heavyweight and he won a tremendous amount of of legitimate fighting titles was he  pretty he was i will say this he's a handsome guy uh but again she would just have sex with him i think  and uh he was notorious she said for wanting that type of activity she said he would actually travel 
[02:00:30]  with a few different ones de la jolla would do that no de la jolla i actually don't think would  would engage that roberto duran no mas no mas hey he's yelling no kimmy morrison no i can't say  his name i will say he was a white guy that's all i can say is he was a white guy i think women like  that type of stuff because most women are gay themselves and then for them to be with a man  to be doing that or putting on panties stuff like that's the closest thing they can get kind of fills  that little boy they got where they might want to be with a chick yeah because a lot of women they 
[02:01:00]  do they'll kiss a chick in the club don't see nothing wrong with it yeah everybody experiment a lot of  women they are experimenting they say i just experimented but that's gay if you've been with  it one time that's gay and a lot of women are like that everybody's experimenting either it's  kissing and making out and feeling each other that's not experimenting you're doing it  hold on anthony i'm sorry and i know you're in the middle of a great rant you had to interrupt  we had to interrupt yes because vas uh dr vas has something he wants everybody everybody is born 
[02:01:30]  bisexual whether they practice it you're born ask the doc dr uh jackson you're saying i'm not  saying he everybody's born everybody's born born bisexual because you don't know as a child or you  don't know what's wrong with you listen to me listen to me on the dl everybody is ask the doc is  dr still on dr jessica i'm here no everybody's not born bisexual thank you thank you doc explain 
[02:02:00]  yourself the embryos are not gender identified when they're first created then they get a physical  gender in the womb but they're not born emotionally bisexual i think more people might be if society  allowed it but to me it's a nature like when you get down to the base of nature i mean procreation is  is what nature dictates we do homosexuality may have been put in by nature to kind of like as a  as a population stopper so certain members i don't know what the natural reason i think it's as if you 
[02:02:30]  if you have a child that is destined to be gay and you you try to raise them as a straight child they're  going to end up being gay because they're they're gay well it's the same thing if you have a straight  child and let's say you got some parents that i don't know why but they try to raise the child gay  it's not going to work because they're straight so what what are you what are you talking about  say me and my cousin like when you're young  here comes a cousin story good old when you're young when you're young you know we were kids 
[02:03:00]  we were experimenting young early 20s we didn't know any better right what happened we were both 32  what what me and my cousin what happened we don't have time for this  no no no no we got a little time if you're a surname if you're if you're under like 10 or whatever you  don't know what you're saying you don't know under 10 means he was about 15 he's just lowering the  age let me tell you something 10 is a measurement 
[02:03:30]  under 10 i absolutely had a complete awareness that i liked girls me too in a certain way and i i  liked guys as friends hey look it's hugo uh and uh that was that i didn't need to learn that it  just happened at seven years old you know you like seven years old i was kissing girls in storage  sheds in backyards and playing you know building tree forts with my guy friends i knew one was for 
[02:04:00]  kissing one was for building tree forts that's right yeah mary what were you doing i wasn't doing  any of it i'm just trying to figure out i don't know what i like i like guilt  might as well try both should i should i touch this or stick that in my mouth  your cheeks always look like you had a big gobstopper in his what's the matter we're just  getting to know each other  you guys are sick you know what can we have a better conversation with the ufc champion i think  he's enjoying himself but i don't think he's ever coming back he's laughing at us 
[02:04:30]  i'm laughing at you guys come on he backed away from a dildo and he was confused at 10 years old  dr jessica anything else on this uh yeah i just want to tell you all that i can't tell you how many  guys i've talked to who would never in a million years admit to each other or anywhere in the world  that they are curious about this stuff with the panties and the other thing but they all are 
[02:05:00]  when it comes to you know secretly telling just one person  i think uh i think women out there are trying to get you to put on panties so they have something  on you but that's not a big and they're hoping that you're stupid enough to even uh agree to a  picture and they tell you're done and then you're done they tell all their friends about it trust me  i guess i think i think everybody's secretly naturally curious about what it would be like  to be the other gender because we'll never know well you always think about like oh if i was a girl 
[02:05:30]  all i'd do all day is you know fiddle around with myself yeah yeah exactly what would it be like to  have these things to play with yes i had weight on me i know what it's like  all right you have some pinchable breasts jimmy i really do dr jessica everyone  take care of the dark uh brooklyn ace what's up what's going on boys happy phone call thursday  oh thank you i actually have another reason for calling you guys are forgetting you're talking to

[02:14:00]  what huh as soon as i heard it my first thought right after i heard it was that that's what he said  well yeah you see it our way now right it's obviously saying love mike vick right  you do hear that right yeah situation yes there are many dog lovers fans in the in the nfl but there are  also many many other people who just love mike vick uh and these people too are significant in 
[02:14:30]  numbers wow michelle you're way off on this one it's it's clear as day love mike vick yeah all right  i guess that was worth uh waiting an hour for huh i just i just wanted to tell you guys that it just  sounded a little bit like that all right well i didn't hear it i tried to hear it just for the  sake of the joke but i didn't hear it either yeah i i wish it sounded like that because that would  be hilarious then that would be a clip we would have and we would get to play a lot we would even  be able to play it on regular radio and and maybe uh get one by everybody you know yeah but 
[02:15:00]  unfortunately it's very very obvious he says love mike vick so all right michelle have a good day  okay okay bye bye bye all right sounds just like my deck uh sandy from florida and day sandy  sexism fuck it i like werewolf movie you know what i i put tuna juice on my penis and let the cat lick it

[02:16:00]  vilified for this it's not like a black thing i mean a white athlete who was dog fighting and  murder would get killed for this people go to jail all the time for animal abuse all the time you just  don't know who they are it's it's ridiculous that anybody would say well you know people love dogs and  people love him yeah okay still but he's still you know murderers people love i don't think they go to  jail all the time well a lot of people you barely hear about it look at this because they're not 
[02:16:30]  famous yeah where is this savagery going on bolivia congress well that's good that is great they i love  when these uh countries that um are just uh uh yeah the guy's laughing the the news guy but i love  these countries that think they're um they got this government in place that's doing something and  they just go inside and beat the shit out of each other they just start pounding each other with chairs  and microphones fists it happened in our congress recently too someone threw a punch or a shot it's

[02:17:30]  phrase and then we have to guess what it is and we have multiple choice uh answers just in case you  can't figure it out on your own i certainly hope he was able to decipher what they were saying  because there are a couple of them that were impossible all right before we get to that we  got uh this is the end of the whole poetry slam uh we're squeezing out as much audio as possible  but we're running out here uh poetry slam life in drag first as danny makes it into the studio 
[02:18:00]  we got to play this for everybody today yes sir if i could be a woman my body would be stunning  if i could be a woman my body would be stunning it would be steamy fiery and i would probably weigh  a hundred pounds it would be steamy fiery and i'll probably weigh a hundred pounds i would be six  foot and have a b cup i would be six foot i'll probably have a b cup my hair would be blonde my hair 
[02:18:30]  would be blonde my shoes would be high tops my shoes would my shoes would be high top my toes would  be beautiful my toes would be beautiful i would just have a beautiful body i would just have a beautiful  body all women would be jealous all women will be jealous even straight men would want me even straight  men will want me i would be happy looking like a woman i would be happy looking like a woman and 
[02:19:00]  living a life in drag. I'm gonna get rid of all my male clothes. And get only girl clothes.  My family would be surprised. But they would learn to love me for who I am. And not worry  what I look like. And not worry what I look like. My nails would have a French manicure. My nails 
[02:19:30]  would have a French manicure. I would be in a viper. I would be in a viper. And be a supermodel.  And be a supermodel. Supermodel. They have lots of money. Because they have lots of money. And a lot  of men. And a lot of men. I would be able to walk. I'd be able to walk. I'd be able to have a boyfriend.  I'd be able to have a boyfriend. I'd be able to get married. I'd be able to get married. I would be 
[02:20:00]  loved for who I am. I would be loved for who I am. A retarded cross-dresser. Yeah, he's in a wheelchair  and he's in full cross-dressing attire. The video makes it really creepy. It's special poetry slam  life in drag for people who are trying to find it. Sounds like Mary Jo Badafuka being interviewed.  I don't like the way the poor guy, like, they're trying to make it this high-end thing, a higher  thinker. Yeah. How about this? I love cocks. I love cocks. Dresses make me want to get fucked 
[02:20:30]  up the butt. Dresses make me want to get fucked up the butt. Because I hate daddy and I love  mommy. Why not just say that? Instead of making this artsy thing? Well, yeah, because the guy's  retarded. I mean, you know, if someone's a Columbia grad and they want to make those decisions,  but the guy just likes dresses because they feel silky. Yeah. He doesn't know. He likes  Doris Day. They feel good. Yeah. Let's say hi to Micah Long Island. If I was a woman, I'd  be a cunt. Mike, what's up? Hey, you know, I'm not a black guy. I'm not an athlete. I'm 
[02:21:00]  sticking up for Mike Vick. Why is that? Because what's the difference between beating up a wife  or doing some drugs and then maybe getting 30 days and then going on to the field and getting  all kinds of accolades? So, you know, he did dog fighting. I like that. Hold on, sir.  What's the difference? Hold on, hold on. One thing at a time. Yeah, your phone's crapping  out. You're not wrong. You're not wrong about the drugs and the fighting, like the domestic  violence. But just because that shit is not handled the way it should be doesn't mean  that the dog fighting shouldn't be handled properly. Also, too, a wife talks back. A 
[02:21:30]  dog doesn't. All right. So maybe she deserves it. No, you can't pay off a dog. That's the  problem. You can't pay off a dog. You know what? You can't say, well, if this guy gets  away with armed robbery, why can't a murderer get away? It's illegal and it's inhumane to  sit there and kill dogs, electrocute them and hang them. It's not inhumane to beat your  wife up? Give me a break. Sir, it is. Yes, it is. So you're comparing apples to oranges.  It doesn't matter. It's both apples and oranges. No, it's the problem is, dude, dog fighting 
[02:22:00]  is illegal. So is beating your wife. But dog fighting to me shows is also something  that's done for profit. There's a viciousness. There's a complete indifference in dog  fighting. Doing drugs is stupid, but we understand why people do drugs. Hitting  your wife is all. Jim Norton, are you saying that killing a dog is worse than  beating a wife? Absolutely. I'm saying that. And I'm saying that hitting your wife  should be rewarded. Jesus. I think the problem. I don't think we condone that on 
[02:22:30]  this program. I think the problem a lot of people are having is the magnitude of  this thing. It wasn't like one pit bull. They're finding dead pit bulls all over  that property. And the way, I mean, they're drowning dogs. They're electrocuting  them. It wasn't one. I think it's the amount of dogs that really bother people on  this story there, Mike. Well, you know what? You know what? Making an example out  of this guy, this guy's career is over. That's a bunch of bullshit. I mean, not for 
[02:23:00]  nothing. You know what? Guy, you know what? Maybe he was into this stuff. He made a  mistake. Why are they going to vilify this one guy for this? He made a mistake? 60  dead dogs? That's 60 mistakes. Hey, I'll tell you. You know what? Let me ask you. Did  he kill those dead dogs? Or were those dead dogs being killed by people that were doing  the dog fighting? Both, dude. I think they said he did actually kill someone. He did take  part, apparently. I don't know. Again, I wasn't there, but I heard he did take part in  some of the execution. You know what, though? I sort of agree with Mike on one  point. You know, let him play. Let him play. Well, if he's not in jail, I don't 
[02:23:30]  give a shit what my star player does. I don't give a crap. I really don't. I  don't give a crap. I don't give a crap if the athletes are doing steroids or any  of that anymore. I used to care. I don't care anymore. And if he can help the team  win, who gives a shit what he does in his personal life? If that guy does come back to  the NFL, I guarantee you, whatever team picks him up, he's going to come back to a standard  ovation. And as long as he wins, he's going to do it. And that guy should not come back  to booze. Come back to booze, dude. 
[02:24:00]  And you say you don't care, but any boss or owner, would you hire a pedophile to work  in here that you know was a kid toucher? So everybody still, you still care as a boss  or as an owner. Are you going to make money or lose money on this guy?  This is all right. So what you're saying is that you're not going to hire this guy  because he killed 60 dogs, but let's go get a five year, $50 million contract. They  got a piece of shit out of his wife. Like who? Well, no, no, no. I didn't say  first. Hold on. Who are you talking about? Yeah. Dude, it doesn't make a difference. 
[02:24:30]  Just pick a, pick a guy. Look at Larry. No, no, no. Why? Dude, give me an example of  who you're talking about. Like with, with the drugs, the drugs, they're, they have a policy  for that. Um, third time and you're out. Uh, I'm not saying I agree with it, but I'm  saying there is a policy for it and also dogfighting is gambling, which is a big problem. I mean,  look, Pete Rose, here's an example. Chris Albrecht, it's not an athlete, but had an  incident with his wife or his girlfriend where he gets drunk and he hits her and he loses  one of the greatest gigs in show business, which is the president of HBO. I mean, there 
[02:25:00]  are times when you're off the field or out of the office behavior affect what you're  doing. And it's unfortunate that I don't know. I don't see it that way. I really don't.  I see Mike's point as far as the NFL has this, uh, this fake morality thing where they think  they have, you know, they got this up and up organization, uh, this, uh, high and mighty  organization where everyone is a squeaky clean. I get that part of it, Mike. Absolutely.  All right. Bottom line is without comparing it, say without comparing it to beating up your  wife or doing Coke or robbing a bank, killing 60 dogs and having dog fights in your property 
[02:25:30]  and hanging them. Is there something wrong with that? Yes or no. Okay. Then don't  compare, don't compare, identify. All right. The point he's trying to make, he agrees that  it's wrong, but he doesn't think the guy should lose his entire NFL career over it. Well, that's  it's all about money. You know, that the bosses, uh, team owners are going to say, well, are  we going to lose money on them or are we going to, Oh my God, you can't be further from the 
[02:26:00]  truth. This fucking guy, if he played this year, the, the, they would make a shit  load of money off this. Yep. A shit load of money. Nobody would take his jerseys though.  His merchandising would be a problem. I don't know, dude. I think that PETA is relatively  powerful. The outcry, you want to talk about advertisers being attacked, the banks, all  these people, even the liquor companies that are involved with stadiums would go after  them. It'd be a dumb financial move. That's what I'm saying. I think that they would be  hurt by it because so many people would come after you. Yeah. You know what? All right. 
[02:26:30]  I'd have to back up a little bit. Yeah. Cause I wasn't thinking that, uh, uh, I wasn't  thinking about that, uh, part of this whole thing. Yeah. I was, I was thinking about just  the, I don't agree with it. I don't agree. I think it's ridiculous. Let me get an example  out of this guy. You know what? It's terrible what he did to the dogs. I love dogs. If he  did it to cats, honest, I wouldn't give a rat to it. Sorry about Jack Jack. Okay. But you  know what? Hey, don't you bring Jack Jack into this? I love dogs. All right. But you know  why if this was anybody else, uh, if you know with anything, it wouldn't have been 
[02:27:00]  that big of a deal. They're going to make an example out of this guy. I think it's  unfair. He's like, he's faced what he's faced. Like three years in jail, four years  in jail. He's a plea bargain. I don't know exactly. I think Mike, you know, you  can't downplay it though. I mean, like I said earlier, it's the volume of dogs that  were involved that I think really got people. And the methodology of, of killing  them puts him in, he's not a sane person. He's kind of like serial killer  insane to have the ability to hang a dog and, and slit a dog's throat and 
[02:27:30]  electrocute a dog and drown a dog. It, it makes you, you're, you're crazy. You're  a real crazy, dangerous person. I think if you have the potential to do that to an  animal, but other people would say, we just don't get that culture and that  they're not crazy for doing that. I don't know. I guess we'll just have to agree to  disagree. All right. Hey, I like that. Let's just agree to disagree. All right.  Thanks for the call, Mike. And don't forget, Mike, one more thing is, is they  making the example out of him, but it's this, this, this thing doesn't come up 
[02:28:00]  that often. It's not like this happens a lot. Right. It just, you know, I've never  heard of it. I'm sure it happens, but I haven't heard of it. Well, people get  arrested for animal abuse. People get arrested all the time for animal abuse. You  don't know who they are. Obviously when a superstar does something. That's a good point.  If you hear news, you hear this guy. But you don't hear about it. I don't know. I don't  remember ever hearing. Really? Go on the internet. I couldn't tell you the last time  actually before the internet. Oh, whatever. News. I go on the internet. What do we put 
[02:28:30]  in Google? What do we put in Google? Animal arrests. Animal, animal arrests? Arrests.  How do you spell arrest? They show him handcuffing a horse. Don't turn this. Animal's making a  citizen's arrest and cuffing a guy for sitting in the looks. Animal arrests. No, can you put in  animal arrests for me? I want to see what comes up. A-R-E-S-S. Animal arrests. I heard  an L in there. Animal arrests. But whatever. Yeah, there it is. L arrests. Okay. Animal arrests.  All right. All right. Some foreign language. Animal proteins. Thank you, Rich. I can read 
[02:29:00]  about animal proteins. Nothing about animal arrests. I just don't see anything under animal  arrests. Oh, well. Oh, well. But then again, you know. Did you mean animal oppress? All right.  Let's try animal oppress. Animal planet. All right. Getting closer. Always. She reveals  the dignity of each animal trying to survive in a world made cruel and dangerous by the 
[02:29:30]  thoughtlessness of humans through animals' eyes. Whatever. You hear it on the news all  the time. All the time. Yeah. Not all the time. You know. We're talking about it right now.  Oh, wait. No. That's the weather. Yeah. Well, all the time would mean. Well, we got it.  Yeah. They are talking about it. Oh, it's a bad economy. That's cheaper gas. Yeah. Three  news stations on and not one talking about this all the time. All the time. Oh, thanks.  Well. Oh, here it comes. Uh, no. No. No. People on scooters. And that's from Swollen  River from the Search for Missing Hiker. Hiker. It's an ATV story. Well, maybe the hiker 
[02:30:00]  was a dog. Yeah. Well, gas is at 297. Maybe dogs drive. Maybe. Oh, look. He's doing the  weather. Maybe it's a good day for dog fighting. Maybe it's raining dogs and dogs. All right.  All right. Wow. I didn't like your hand tap because you lost faith in it. Yeah. You  guys can't see out there, but Rich taps his hand with dogs and dogs because he knew. Oh,  my God. Can I say something? Yeah. I tried. I went and started the Terrence Howard. You  know what? There it goes. Oh, there is the dog fighting and football. What is this? A brazen 
[02:30:30]  thief in the act. Look at this guy. What did he break the window with? Rocks? I don't  know. Yo, I'm gone. Yeah. He's pushing the window in, stealing something.  Oh, God. Look, it's a serious unit. Well, you know, it's not a book. We were supposed  to have Terrence Howard calling today and he didn't. I'm thinking he got embarrassed by  that movie. You went and saw it, right, Jimmy? It was a very bad movie. Yeah? With Richard 
[02:31:00]  Gere. Very bad movie. Oh, Richard Gere. Yeah. It's just not at all a good movie. Did you hear  the gerbil story with him? What happened? Oh, it's quite sexy. He kills them, right,  if they don't fight properly? Yes. Wait, are you saying that... Gerbil fighting. Are you  saying if Richard Gere's in a movie, it's got to be bad? Yeah, these days. Or he hasn't  done one in a while? These days. Let's go IMDb, Richard. Last good movie, I would say,  was the one with Edward Norton. Power was his best. Primal Fear? Primal Fear. Right? That was 
[02:31:30]  the last good movie he made. Pretty Woman was good. I mean, you know, it was... No, I liked  some of his earlier movies. How about Nights in Road to Death? What? Exactly. Oh, it's not  out yet. This was a movie. Let me just tell you what it was about. It's called The Hunting  Something. And it's about him and Terrence Howard play reporters. And it's based on a true  story. The Hunting Party. The Hunting Party. It's not 100% true. It's about three reporters  that are going to Bosnia after the Bosnian Serb thing. And trying to capture one of the 
[02:32:00]  guys who's on the run. Like one of the head massacrists. They decide they want to capture  him. It's an awful concept. I didn't know what part tied in to be true. I mean, I guess  that there are reporters and Bosnia exists. I mean, they proved me right. I look on the  map. I'm like, yeah, Bosnia's there. But it was terribly acted. I couldn't leave a bed  the acting was. No kidding. Dude, Terrence Howard's amazing. And Richard Gere's 
[02:32:30]  awful. They had a scene with a CIA agent. And I hate when movies do this. With a CIA  guy. It's such obvious propaganda. Like the CIA guy is not talking like a CIA guy. He's  talking the way two jerk offs at a party think a CIA guy talks. Like, dude, you know  the fucking CIA is over there. They ain't really looking for Bin Laden. And like the CIA guy  is going, why do you think we haven't found him? Don't, do you think we're not looking  like the CIA guy is saying things that a CIA guy would never say to reporters, much less 
[02:33:00]  it was awful. And maybe that's why he didn't want to do our show. There are times when like  an actor sees the reviews and realizes, wow, this is a real bomb. They just go into hiding.  They don't do press for something. I'd like to think that, but between being embarrassed  of a movie that you've just made that is being released or being embarrassed of being on this  show, I would pick this show. I didn't see him doing a lot of other press either. He  was on Good Morning America. He left before the premiere was over. By the way, Richard 
[02:33:30]  Gere was in Chicago. Maybe not a movie. I didn't like that fucking movie either. You saw  Chicago? Of course I did. I don't think I saw Chicago. Didn't like it. Shall we dance?  Oh, yeah, exactly. Shall we dance? But Chicago got a nice buzz out there. Shall we shove a  gerbil up our ass? Why the gerbil joke every time? Because every time Richard Gere is brought  up, I want to bring up that poor gerbil. You ever see that movie? Oh, we can rework. We  can rework all the movies. You ever see Power? Richard Gere, the movie Power? No. When 
[02:34:00]  did that come out? A political campaign manager or something? It was great. It was a great  movie. Internal Affairs is a great movie too. Actually, that movie was called Internal Gerbils.  Internal Gerbils. And we got Pretty Gerbil he made. Final Gerbil he made. Officer  in a Gerbil. And the Gerbil played on. He was in that one. Primal Gerbil. Or Gerbil  Fear, sure. Yeah. What else was he in? American Gerbil-o. He was in the Gerbil Club. Let's 
[02:34:30]  not forget, an officer in a Gerbil. Yeah. How could we forget that? American Gerbil, you  know. He just said it. I know. Oh, vicious dog attack. I was looking at her face. Someone  got their face eaten. No, dude, that's the story we did yesterday. Is that the doggy door  one? Yeah, with the pit balls. Pit balls. Pit balls. The pit balls coming in the doggy  door. Hey, this is something we got to go to. I just don't hear it this way, but Shane  in Kansas. What's up, Shane? What's up, guys? Hey, kiddo. There's a soundbite of the president 
[02:35:00]  of the NAACP that you have to find yesterday. He was giving a press conference about the  Michael Vick case. And the guy should really say, he should really say Michael when he  talks. Because he was talking about how many people hated Michael Vick, but he was, in the  same token, he thought there was many, many people that liked his dick. So you're saying  that, like, you don't understand why he would defend Michael Vick. Okay, and I understand  what you're saying is, how could this guy come out defending Michael Vick? Let's quickly play  it. So you're saying, instead of saying Michael Vick, he said my dick? He said many, many people 
[02:35:30]  like my dick. Get the fuck out of here. Why would someone say that? Do we have a clip of  that interview? We certainly do have a clip. Let's all listen very carefully, okay? All  right, let's listen. So Shane, you're saying he says my dick instead of Mike Vick. That's  correct. All right, let's take a listen. All right, let's take a listen together. Get  to the bottom of this. Trying to remedy the whole situation. Yes, there are many dog lovers, 
[02:36:00]  fans in the NFL, but there are also many, many other people who just love Mike Vick. Oh, my  God. And these people, too, are significant in numbers. I don't hear it, dude. So he said  a lot of people love Mike Vick. No, really. I think he's talking about my dick. Dude, it's  clear. How do you hear my dick in that? I didn't hear that. Are you kidding me? 
[02:36:30]  Hmm. Shane. He's gone. Oh, he hung up. Oh, what a Shane. You gotta be crazy to hear my  dick in this. Yeah. Every time. Wow. How many are we going to guess? This should prove  to some people, though. Why do we even try on the show? No, this should prove to some  people, the hardcore fans that listen to the entire program and then bitch about, you guys  played that or this or that. See, there are plenty of people that don't listen to the 
[02:37:00]  entire program. Not even close. Not even two days. I love the people that listen to every  word. Oh, of course we do. Man, are you a minority. But God bless you guys. God bless.  Hey, so retard poetry slam, King Gimp style game. What happened to Danny? He went away.  Where'd Danny go? Well, Danny put this together. Danny, what do you think? Bars aren't open  yet? You got a mic over there. There's our favorite drunkard. Hi. Partner in crime. Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  We haven't drank in a while. We'll have to go out on Friday. Ah, nice. Ah, ah, oh, drinky.  What's up, Danny? Not much. I just remembered the old, actually, Derek suggested from this clip,  so I should actually give him some credit. No. We both, we all remember the King Gimp game  from years and years and years ago, and we felt that this was a perfect clip to pull  and kind of try and mimic that game from years ago. All right, so we got a phrase. So 
[02:38:00]  we play the phrase. We'll play the phrase first, and then if you guys want to guess what he's  saying off the cuff, if you want to go with multiple choice answers, I have multiple choice  answers. Okay. And then, obviously, for you, the track following will be the answer. Ooh! Because  this is the guy that talks with the Stephen Hawking voice box. Ah. Can I play game show  host? Certainly. No, that's your job. No, it's all yours if you'd like it. All right, here's  the first phrase. Get the fuck out of here. I actually know what you said. Now I remember 
[02:38:30]  the King Gimp game. God, it was so hard. You guys couldn't understand it? No, Jimmy, what  do you got? I know what he said. All right. Merziedotes and doziedotes and...  And she's dodging me. What the fuck? Wow, that's impossible. All right. All right. Give... Wait a minute. Are they doing another interview? Like, I don't need to know what... 
[02:39:00]  Does it follow the I'm blank and I like? No. No, it's just him talking about a subject. Okay. Him talking about a subject. Let's hear it again. Oh, I know what you... 
[02:39:30]  I do like P1s. You're right, Steve. Uh, could you give us a hint? I don't want a hint. I know now he's talking about stuff. He's talking about stuff. All right, you want to hear it again? Yeah, let's hear it. All right.  Ask not what your country can do for you. That is completely unintelligible. It was something about gumdrops. I think he's saying like, but he does not at the end. I got an answer. No? Yeah, I didn't think so. Fucking retard. He's saying there is no God. 
[02:40:00]  You should be. You should be. Wow. Wait. How could he be a God? Wait a minute. Can we hear one more, please? Sure, Jimmy. I think I got it. I don't... Something about more. The word more. Oh. Let's hear it.  I think if my mother drank a little less, this wouldn't have happened. No, he's going... He's going, oil can. Oil can. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, a joke from 1939. A joke from 1939. Well, you got it, though, right? Who didn't? You're a ventriloju.  That was awful. One more time. I can get this. I'm very close to getting it. Oh, really? Yeah, I just want to get it. All right. 
[02:41:00]  I can't hear me now. I can't hear me now. Touring with David Lee Roth is going to be fantastic. I can't wait.  And having my son on the bass guitar will make me very happy.  Wait, I think I got it. What? Yeah. And then Michael Vick put an electric prod. All right, maybe not.  Oh, wow. Oh, maybe not. Where's the car? Why? Could it be a dog? 
[02:41:30]  Well... I made an ass of myself. I'm sorry I did that.  We all hear the word more in there, right?  I'm embarrassed that I did that. Sorry, sorry. Is it? I hear the word more. So I'm going  to guess, choke me more, I could still breathe. How about chromosomes? I have one more than  you do. Hoffman from Wagbag, he writes, well, I don't know what he writes because it updated. 
[02:42:00]  Man, we got to like rework this instant feedback. Like maybe we make things smaller so it stays  on the screen longer. Because he had a great one. Oh, he's saying, I suck cock for K-Rock.  This retard got the phrase that pays. All right, it's time for the answer. You want to give us  a multiple choice here? Yeah, I'll give you four multiple choice. All right. Is it A, I think  I'm in love and I like movies? B, there's pain in my jaw, they might remove it? Could be. 
[02:42:30]  C, ice skating brings me joy, I like the movement. Or D, I think I want more, I like to do it.  That's it. Nope. D, I'll bet money. I know. I think I like more, I want more, I like to  do it. Exactly. He saw a picture of cotton candy. That's what I'm saying. It's the ice skating  one. Positive. Okay. What do you say? I have to go with D too. Now let's listen to it because  now we know what the answer really is. All right. I think I want more and I like to do 
[02:43:00]  it. That's definitely it. Well, should we play the answer, I guess? Yeah, I guess. I heard  ice skating there. No. Ice skating gives me joy. I like the movement. Fuck that cocksucker. How  can you not hear ice skating? He starts off by saying. How could you hear anything in what that  guy was trying to fucking say? One more time, I can't believe you heard it. Ice skating. I heard 
[02:43:30]  that one. All right, it starts with ice skating. I just want to set it up. Listen, it's obvious he  says ice skating to start this. Oh, wow. This is a hard game. One for me. All right, here's  the next one. Like, give a shit. You can tell we're a day away from vacation. Here we 
[02:44:00]  go. We'll have a huge blowout show tomorrow and then we're out of here for a week. All  right. Ah, the second one. Oh my God, my brain's getting tired. It makes me something to be out  there with my friends. It makes me stupid. Fuck ice skating. I can't do it. No. One more 
[02:44:30]  time. Oh, boy. Come on.  It makes me feel hop hog. I'm a teacher in the Peanuts cartoon.  Let's go to Hellboy. Hellboy. Yeah, man. It sounds like Voss talking baby talk to Bonnie 
[02:45:00]  to me. It's Voss baby talk. Let's say hi to Larry in Texas. Larry. Larry. Hey. Larry.  What are you guys doing? I need your stupid intern playing Chubby Bunny. Oh, you think they're  just playing Chubby Bunny? Chubby Tungy. Let's go to Eric in New York. Eric. I believe  he said foundry's watermark is more important than opinion. Yes. Sorry. I laughed over the 
[02:45:30]  second half of you. I'm trying to drive traffic to the Moe haircuts. Let's go to Adam in Wisconsin.  Adam. Hey. I think I got the answer. It's I can hear him. He's saying my refrigerator door  fell off and I need tears. Good callback, sir. I enjoy a good callback. Multiple choice  or any more guess? Guesses? Guess the multiple choice. Yeah. Multiple choice. Well, is it 
[02:46:00]  A? It makes me feel I have somebody out there waiting for me? B? It makes me feel I have  feelings. Help me with mine. C? It hurts because I have nobody helping with my life. Or D? It  makes me feel so happy to be out there with my friends. Ah. That was what I said. D? What  a coincidence it would be if that was wrong. But that's what I heard. Where was out there  though? It was probably just a parking lot they pushed them into. Friends. They're rocks. 
[02:46:30]  You sure there's not another answer? Uh, what could it be? Well, how about, uh, Sean from  Virginia Beach? He's saying, my dick's all shitty. Time for the answer? Yeah. All right.  Here we go. It makes me feel so happy to be out there with my friends. That's easy. Yeah.  That's what I had. Why did you just use that to begin with? I did? No, no. Him. Oh. Because 
[02:47:00]  then we wouldn't have a game. Why should we do all the talking? Can we hear the other,  can we hear the clear one first? Here's the clear one. It makes me feel so happy to be out  there with my friends. I know what he's saying. He's going. All right. Here's, uh, we got  two more to go. Here we go. Cool. Or maybe not. Cut. I know I have ruined many photographs. 
[02:47:30]  I can't exactly. I'm going to guess, uh, I'm going to guess I'm alive. Don't pull that  plug. Pete Rose, 12 o'clock. We were walking through the airport. Fucking Anthony is such  a dick. And we're walking through the airport in Detroit. And he just goes, Pete Rose, 12 
[02:48:00]  o'clock. And he points. And ahead of us, it's a retarded person with the Pete Rose hair.  God, were we laughing? Isn't that horrible? Pete Rose, 12 o'clock. It was so casual. I  didn't, the funny thing was I didn't catch it for another 10 steps. Yeah, until we actually 
[02:48:30]  saw. We were up close. Oh, no. Pete Rose. I know that I have never. No. Something on  my head. Fred from Brooklyn's got it. He's good at this game. Fred, go ahead. Hey, what's  up, guys? Is that Dave ordering another drink at Ball 9? I think he's saying winning last 
[02:49:00]  comic four was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Who won it? Josh, please? Oh, Brian  in New York, what's up? What's up, guys? Hey. He's saying my friend E-Rock is a fat fuck  and has a Pete Rose haircut. That was awful and mean-spirited. Oh, boy, that was very hurtful.  That was very hurtful, Brian. We like to tease E-Rock, but that was just hurtful. We don't 
[02:49:30]  like to hurt E-Rock's feelings. All right, what are the multiple choice answers? Funny. Of  course, then fuck his feelings. That's something with love. Well, the multiple choice for this  one is A, I know that I know, excuse me, I know that I have never in real life, I know  now that I've never seen it with my eyes. I know now. Was he fucking Shakespeare? Hark.  Eric in Texas. I don't know that. No, he sees a red fucking heart. Hark. Eric in Texas? 
[02:50:00]  Pete Rose, 12 o'clock. I know I have a dick in my mouth, but it tastes so good.  Wait, what was it? Oh, boy, Kike from Philly. I know I bet on baseball, but I should be in  the Hall of Fame. That's a damn good one. Yeah, go ahead. Let's see. C, I know I have 
[02:50:30]  never honored a contract. Jesus, Danny. Wait. You got lazy today, didn't you? Wait, wait,  I know I have never honored a contract. You got a reference to something? Oh. No. Or D, I  have never fallen on the ice. Uh, no. Uh, Dana has obviously got it. Yes, Dana. Uh, I think  he's saying, I love to jerk off to videos of Terry Schiavo. Holy shit.  Toss, let me. Yeah. Yes. I am the werewolf. I like to make werewolf movies. Like to make 
[02:51:00]  werewolf movies. Well, it's Tough Target Thursday. Yeah. An hour and a half on retards. Oh, boy.  What the fuck? You're right. Hey, Eric. All right. Uh, who gives a shit? Should we just play  the answer at this point? Yeah, please. I have never fallen on the ice. I've never 
[02:51:30]  what? I've never fallen on the ice. Well, because isn't his, like, skates attached to his wheelchair?  You fall. How do you fall if you're a square? Yeah, you haven't fell. Dummy. What the fuck?  I gotta pee. What? Jimmy? I have to make a leaky. All righty. Dr. Leaky.  Go ahead, man. I don't interfere. Oh. No problem. Here's the next one. And the final 
[02:52:00]  one. The final one. Here it is. All right. What? What are you doing? I was going to ring  it in. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, go, go. Why is he peeing? I'm just kidding. I'm just  gay. Look at you. I'm so gay. Eh, just open it and stick the mic in. Jimmy's peeing.  Come on. Yeah? Sounds like me talking. 
[02:52:30]  Your stream's starting and stops a lot. Prostate problem. He's, uh, removing kidney stones.  Oh. Say. You all right, Jimmy? Yeah. Good. Your stream starts and stops a lot. Well,  towards the end, it does. I don't know why. Uh-oh. Could be prostate. Really? You're 
[02:53:00]  going to... I piss so much, dude. You're going to have to get a finger up your ass. What's  that? You're going to have to get a finger up your ass. At a doctor's office. No, I just  left here. We could all just take turns. I've had my prostate checked before. Oh, you  have. Fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. With what young lady's tongue? A little flaw on. Do  you wake up in the middle of the night pissing a lot? Five times. Out in the middle of the  night? Yeah. I'm a lucky boy. When I go in to my doctor's office for strep throat, I get  my ass checked. Why for strep throat? I want to call my doctor and find out because I'm still 
[02:53:30]  trying to figure it out. I'm, uh... Time to switch doctors, don't you think? I just got the  letter in the mail, too, that said, uh, from my general practitioner that was like, uh,  just a reminder, it's time for your yearly physical exam. It's like, this thing fucking  rolls around. I think they're sending that out every six months. Ah. Because I dread  it because it's the finger up the ass. They probably have some weird bed at the doctor.  Finger up the ass. They probably have a weird bed at the doctor's office. Let's see if he 
[02:54:00]  comes in again. He's coming in so he can stick fingers up his ass. Oh, God. No, because  it's always around this time. Yeah, all right. Oh, hate that. Who takes a physical every  year? Uh, you know. Pretty much people that want to stay healthy. Yeah, you want to kind  of, you know. Yeah, once you reach a certain age, things happen fast. They could cure a  lot of stuff if they catch it early. That's why you go once a year there. Jack Klugman  survived throat cancer. He could still talk because they caught it early. Yeah. Frank Zappa 
[02:54:30]  would have still been alive if he would have gotten his prostate checked. When was the last  time you had your ass checked? Uh, about a month ago. About, I had a physical. In  the doctor's office. Yeah, completely. And it was the first one. And my doctor's funny  too because. Is he hysterical? I go, I said, I feel really close and when you put your finger  in me, he goes, two fingers. Yeah, I've had it all checked. I got a fucked up stomach.  So they have to go in your ass? Well, no, I, I know that was different. That's sort of the 
[02:55:00]  long way around. Don't get it. What the fuck, dude? Through fucking 30 feet of intestine or  so. Why don't they just put a fucking camera in somebody's balls so that they tend to drink  it? Oh my God. Yeah. All right, here's the final one. I don't know, it's a little redundant. 
[02:55:30]  He kind of repeats himself. Sounds like, are we on? Are we on? Hmm. That's a toughie.  Yeah. I'm running out of lines. What's he saying? I played Superman. One more? Just one more  time. All right. I hear a lot of owing, so I'm thinking, ow, that's my ass. Ow, that's 
[02:56:00]  my ass. I don't know. That should hold the fuckers for a while. Right. Oh my, ah, oh  my, ah, I think that, I don't know. What are the choices? Well, you guys will never get  it. It's either A, when we are all done, we have a nice meal. B, when we're, when we are  on set, they're always talking in my ear. C, when we are on the ice, we have the same 
[02:56:30]  freedom. Or D, when we all hang out next, we have to have a beer. C. Wow. I don't know  how to pronounce your name, but some dude from Bermuda. I think he's saying, welcome  to another New Year's Rocket. Good one. Take your bra off. Take it off now. Coming in. 
[02:57:00]  All right. Russman doesn't like this. Well, Russman, go to 47. I would suggest that today.  What does Russman think? It's too mean? All right, enough of this fucking bogus bullshit.  Mean-spirited. Totally not funny. Really? Don't listen. I've never seen more instant  feedback come in, in recent weeks, and the phones just are lit. Yourself. Ready for  the answer? Yep. Here we go. When we are on the ice, we have the same freedom. That's me. 
[02:57:30]  That didn't sound like that at all. No. Who is we? What does he have the same freedom  as? Somebody takes a tree stump and kicks it across the ice?  He's talking about curling. When we were on the ice, we have the same mental capacity.  See him in an empty turtle shell sliding across the ice.  It's got to be empty or it's smarter. I love that. All right. Well, there you go. 
[02:58:00]  That was a tough game. The King Gimp game has made an appearance back on the show there.  The werewolf retards. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like to make werewolf movies. Movies. Movies. I am  the werewolf. More with Rich Voss, who will be at the Improv Labor Day weekend in Pittsburgh.  And I have a phoner to do in a little while. Why? I have to. With who, Jimmy? Mike Gallagher. 
[02:58:30]  I thought it was yesterday, but I fucked up. But, uh... Oh. Can we do it together?  We can't. Oh. He doesn't like us? I don't know. It's not true at all. I think he actually does. Yeah.  But he's God bless America guy. Is he? Right? Very conservative. Yeah. Oh, good. And we're, you know...  NBA star defends Michael Vick. Calls... Yeah, that was the, um... Calls dogfighting sport.  That was... What's his name? Malbury. Malbury. Oh, okay.  It's a culture we just don't understand, maybe. That's what I'm gonna say today. That's my take 
[02:59:00]  on it today. We didn't ask Quentin just in case he aggraved at Michael Vick. We all would have  had to... Oh, fuck. No one was brave enough to ask Rampage. No one was brave enough to ask  him about the dogfighting. All right, here we go. You're kidding? Brave enough? What? I had a great  line when he talked about how he was afraid of ghosts, and I was really not gonna go there.  Oof. Gold. Oh. Just gold. I'm afraid of spooks, too. Oh, Jesus, Ross. Ghosts, I'm saying. 
[02:59:30]  You know, you know, we're trying to just have a little fun here. Do you understand something?  What? When I say something like I said it... What? Don't you understand I'm saying it like  that for a reason? Oh, was that the same joke? Oh, my God. What the fuck did you think  I was talking about? I don't know. There's a lot of jokes about it. He just doesn't know.  About ghosts? Yeah. What possible other joke could there be about ghosts that I wasn't 
[03:00:00]  brave enough to make the joke to a giant African-American fighter? What possible other joke could there  be? Well, that could be quite clear, right? And you have to just blurt it out. I was going  with the old... I was going old school, Abbott and Costello. You know how they would portray  ghosts in Abbott and Costello? And that would look like something else? I honestly didn't  know. I didn't think of what Rich said. I just didn't know where you were going with it.  Well, I was going there. Oh, really? And I think enough people got it. We'll see. Great 
[03:00:30]  minds think a lot. I like... Oh, my God. Yeah, exactly. Great minds think a lot. Technically  correct. I didn't realize we were still playing the King Gimp game. Do we have multiple choice  answers on this one? Great minds think a lot. Great minds think a lot. Is that what he said?  Yeah. Oh, my God. I hope fucking Bonnie is packing her stuff. She really should. I hope  Shahar the kid just leave you. Does your kid have earplugs yet? Do not speak to that child. 
[03:01:00]  Let Bonnie do all the talking. The kid picks up on Bonnie speaking and not yours. I've been  trying to figure out what to get you and Bonnie. I got it. Great minds think a lot. Earplugs  think a lot. Earplugs the boss's kid. Save the kid years of problems. Great minds think a lot.  Think a lot. I slipped on that one. Oh, my God. All right. We're going to break. You know 
[03:01:30]  what? Something a little different today. You know, we got to take a break, but we were  talking about Greg Giraldo earlier this morning. Very funny. We found the uncensored, well, part  of his roasting with Flavor Flav, but it's uncensored, which is cool. Let's see what this  XM could do. We like to do this from time to time. You can't do this on regular radio.  No. So Greg Giraldo, as we go to break, he killed. He was the best one at the Flavor Flav  roast. Here he is uncensored.  Cat Williams, Flavor Flav, Snoop, Ice-T. There's so many black dicks up here, I feel like we're 
[03:02:00]  doing this roast in Lisa Lampanelli's mouth. Face it. Face it, Lisa. You've swallowed more  black seeds than Warren's staff at a watermelon eating contest.  Ice-T is here. Holy. Ice-T, you fucking fossil. Holy shit. You're so old. The first thing 
[03:02:30]  you bought with your record deal money was your freedom. On your first album, the N-word  was Negro. Some more is here. Some more when it comes to movies, maybe you should do some 
[03:03:00]  less. Soul Plane. Holy shit. That was such a horrible embarrassment to black people. Brigitte  Nielsen tried to fuck it. Brigitte Nielsen's here. Good to see you sitting up.  Sweetheart. I guess you're in rehab and I really hope that works out for you. But seriously,  if you want to stop repeating the disgusting things you've done in the past, why don't you  just get your pussy sewn shut? Think of how many spools of thread that would take. You're 
[03:03:30]  very tall. You must have an enormous squack. Your pussy's so big, Sylvester Stallone left  his career in there. God, you are a big, ghoulish woman. I'm talking to you, Carrot Top. 
[03:04:00]  Jesus. What happened to your face? I guess your act is not the only thing that's glued together.  Seriously, what did you do to your face? I'm not even kidding. You look retarded. How did you do  that? Did you just walk in and ask for the corky? Yeah. How did you find a plastic surgeon who could 
[03:04:30]  add a chromosome? This is an emergency broadcast. The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming  from your radio is not a mistake. Rock and roll. So I says, I know, that was hilarious. I says, sticking 
[03:05:00]  in my mouth. Journey tribute audio coming, coming, coming our way in a few minutes. Evolution,  revolution, evolution, evolution. All right. With Hugo, a good friend of Anthony's from the old  days. My brother Joe used to be in this band, but he was making more money with the U2 tribute  band, so he had to give up the Journey tribute band. Yeah. You can only really commit to one  tribute band. Right. Mike in Alabama. What's up? Hey, guys. Mike. I'm talking about the biggest  fucking douchebag that I've ever heard. Why? Because of that damn bitch you guys just did. That's 
[03:05:30]  pretty fucking cool. What if you had a kid like that? Here comes a froncus. Am I that  obvious? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We really don't have haters because we're really great  at this. Yeah. You know what it is? It says, you know, you guys are going to hell for that  last bit, and I don't really worry about that hell and heaven thing because no matter which  one you go to, you're going to miss people on the other, at the other joint. You know what 
[03:06:00]  I mean? Yeah, true. So when they say, hey, you're going to go to hell for that next bit,  I'm like, all right, hell's all right because I'm going to know some people there, but then  all the people that go to heaven, I'm going to be bummed out I don't get to see them for  eternity. What about the people that go to heaven? But if you go to heaven, you're going  to want to visit some of your old friends that happen to go to hell, so I just can't worry  about that crap. Isn't heaven supposed to be like eternal happiness and bliss? Like that's  finally your reward, so there's no sadness, but wouldn't you be sad that there wasn't a  person, like you're missing somebody because they went to hell? Yeah. So, well, you're 
[03:06:30]  asking Anthony who he would miss? You never met him. Well, I would have liked to have  talked to him. He would miss the king of hell. Incidentally, Barnes and Noble is not going  to carry the... Oh, Adolf Hitler! Barnes and Noble is not going to carry... Oh my... What?  Sorry, Jimmy, we'll get to the Barnes and Noble thing. What? He was making... Oh, he was  imitating me. What? Come on, we're a little tired. No, not we. What did he do? I'm enjoying 
[03:07:00]  my part of the show. I missed it. What did he say? What? Why are you looking at me? What  did I do wrong? He obviously was imitating you, and you're like, what? Ah, forget it. What  was his exact line? What, is that me? Forget it. You had to be there, which obviously not.  I, um... Yes, Jimmy, sorry to interrupt you. We're rich. He's getting beat up today.  They're not going to carry the OJ book. They said they will not carry the OJ book. It's 
[03:07:30]  like, come on, guys, you can't start doing that shit. They carry... Because Hitler, maybe  to think of that, they carry Mein Kampf. They carry Hitler's shit. It's like, what is going  to be more offensive than books about serial killers and fucking... I mean, come on.  That isn't if I did it. That's look what I did. Yeah, but you know what I'm saying?  They carry all that shit. You could spend 15 minutes in Barnes and Noble, and you could find  some horrific things, is what Jimmy's getting at. Yes, yes. You know what I think the difference  is? So why would they ban the OJ book overall? I think because if Hitler was walking around 
[03:08:00]  dating blondes in Florida and playing golf, they probably wouldn't put Mein Kampf in the  bookstore. All right, but there's probably other horrific people that are walking around.  And after OJ's dead, they will probably put his book in there. Ah, but I'm with Jimmy.  You can't start doing that because then... No, I'm with you on this, too. I'm just probably  thinking what their logic is. You can. You gotta have it all in there. I'm just thinking  what their logic is as to why, you know, Mein Kampf is in there. You carry the OJ book?  Yeah. Yeah. Why not? Well, Mein Kampf is... OJ just snapped one night. I mean, Jesus Christ, 
[03:08:30]  Hitler snapped for five years. And all the proceeds are going to the Goldman family. So you can  help them out. So why... Yeah, why wouldn't you buy, like, five books? You know? Help them  out. Boy, they are sticking it up OJ's ass, man. Oh, yeah. Any dime this guy tries to  make. Because he lives off of his football pension, which, for some reason, is untouchable.  For some reason, his football pension cannot be touched by the Goldman family, which is 
[03:09:00]  ridiculous. They should be able to make him homeless. But he's living large. Man, OJ is...  They really... The country has just fucking... You know what? Nobody ever watched a trial  that closely. Right. Yeah. People think it's all racial. No. Whoever sat glued today,  on TV, watching a trial, and seeing evidence build up. Like, no one. Yeah. You never fucking  did that before. No. That was every bit of it. You were glued watching the testimony.  And the guy's not going to make any money off the book. You got to put it in the bookstores.  If people want to buy it, they're going to buy it. Absolutely. Let the market decide if 
[03:09:30]  it's going to do well or not. Don't tell me what I can and can't read. Agree. All that shit.  I'd read the book in a second. What the hell's going on with this country?  Let's say... Oh, wow. Cool. Seton Smith. Seton. How you doing? Hey, buddy. How are you?  Man, we've been talking about you all week. I know. I've been recording it all week.  It's beautiful. I don't blame you. I didn't know you had XM.  What did you say? I didn't know you had XM. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, yeah. I've had XM the whole time. I didn't get my promo code from y'all, but I'm not even  holding that against y'all. Y'all are beautiful for just having me on.  Well, Seton Smith, he won Car Crash Comedy in DC. Oh, fuck. Hold on a minute, Seton.  Hold on. Please, stay right there.  Hold on. Oh.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Am I calling 92?  You're trying to be caller 92?  And what are you trying to win, sir? 
[03:10:30]  I'm trying to win the traveling virus ticket.  Ah.  Do you know the phrase that pays?  I'm afraid I don't, unless it's something like frankest.  How come I'm listening to the two of you talk?  Who is this?  My name's Scott.  No.  No, I'm calling 92. Seth isn't.  Well, one of you is calling 92.  I know. 
[03:11:00]  Which one can it be?  I'm going to give it to the tranny.  The who?  The tranny.  Who's that?  Who do you think?  What's your name, ma'am?  My name is Joyce.  Joyce, what was it before? Joe?  No.  Because usually you stick to the same first letter, at least.  Yeah, have you got your dick cut off?  Or just hormone treatments?  Or just a way for an operation? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  No.  No.  No what?  You still got to go for the hormone treatments?  No.  I got two kids.  What are you, kidding me?  Yeah, very, very feminine.  You don't sound feminine.  Old but feminine.  What?  Old but feminine.  Do you suck the...  Very cool.  I'm very cool.  Going with the phrase that pays here?  Yeah, we'll do that one.  Get out of here.  Throw it, throw it. 
[03:12:00]  Hello?  Hi, how are you?  Yeah, what's up?  Uh, hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, hi, how are you?  Hello?  Uh, hi.  Uh, did I win anything, or...?  Did I win?  Yeah.  Cool.  Hello? 
[03:12:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Uh, yeah.  Is this K-Rock?  Yeah, is this K-Rock?  All right.  Did I win?  Yeah.  Do what...  Do I need to choose?  What?  Is this K-Rock?  I just act the same thing. 
[03:13:00]  Am I the ninth caller?  Hello?  Yeah.  So what do I need to do?  Uh, I don't know.  Who is this?  Go with two new ones. 
[03:13:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  K-Rock.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah.  Yo, did I win?  K-Rock.  Hello?  Chuck Cockfork, K-Rock. 
[03:14:00]  Yo, what's up, man?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I'm here.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Am I calling 92?  Am I?  Did I make it?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:14:30]  Hello?  Can you hear me now?  Yep.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  Can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Did I make it?  Am I calling 92?  Hello?  Hello?

[03:15:30]  Can I?  What do you know?  What do you know?  What do you know?  What do you know?  What do you know?  What do you know?  Fuckers?  One more.  Hello?  Hello?  Happy.  Give me tickets.  Come on.  It's all wise to you.  Fuckers are all wise now.  You motherfuckers.  That is so fucking funny.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  One more. 
[03:16:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, how you doing?  Take it.  Hello?  Ah.  All right.  That's today's fuck with the K-Rock call.  That's today's hello.  I love the hello.  All right.  Did I win?  Yeah.  What?  Did I win?  Now I can't get Seton Smith back on.  Oh, wait.  I got to change Micey's. 
[03:16:30]  Which Micey is it?  This one?  Mice's.  All right.  Seton, sorry about that.  What's up, man?  No, it was funny.  What's up, bro?  Anyway, yeah, Seton Smith won Car Crash Comedy down there in Washington, D.C.  And, Rich Voss, you were on the stage and you introed Seton Smith because he got the  opening slot because he won Car Crash Comedy.  And how well did he do?  He killed.  He had a great set.  He just killed.  He took advantage of an opportunity, my friend.  And he just, he looked like he had a good time.  You know, he wasn't intimate. 
[03:17:00]  Bullseye.  And besides you being funny and everything, I have to say, your girlfriend is probably  one of the hottest girls on this planet.  I'm telling you, if you don't marry her, listen to me, she's beautiful.  Oh, my God.  And she supports you and she was really a good looking girl.  And you were really funny, man.  Are you nervous?  Did you tell him the first thing you said when you saw her?  Yeah.  You better hope she doesn't meet a headliner.  That's pretty funny. 
[03:17:30]  I don't know.  She's just very attractive.  You're a lucky man.  Seton, what has happened since you opened up the virus show down there in D.C.?  Every open mic-er in D.C. has all congratulated me.  The D.C. Improv works me now.  But other than that, I don't know.  I ain't really know the strategy of sucking dick.  I ain't know whose dick to suck to get worse.  So if y'all can give me like a letter, give me a diagram to who, because I will do it.  Everybody listening, just work me, wherever.  Well, you know what we're going to do? 
[03:18:00]  We should have you on the show soon.  Please.  When are you going to be in New York next?  We would love for you to stop by.  Whenever your door opens, I will be in New York.  All right.  Well, we're going to be on vacation next week.  But we're doing car crash comedy tomorrow for the PNC show that's this Saturday.  Uh-huh.  And I got to tell you, the dude in Philly, I forgot his name, he won car crash comedy.  What?  What, what, what, what?  Are you hearing Rich breathe into the microphone?  No, I'm not breathing, am I? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Dude, it is like...  I'm just trying to talk over it.  I can't even do it.  I have emphysema.  What?  A little bit, just a little.  You have a little emphysema?  Isn't that like a little cancer?  It's going to get worse if I don't start smoking again. 
[03:19:00]  It's not like Albert.  I love that.  That's what a little emphysema sounds like.  Yeah, there's a little emphysema for you.  I was breathing into a mic, you could hear it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I try to be aware of that.  That's one of the things I try to be aware of.  Emphysema.  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  Oh, well.  Well, what I was saying, though, the dude in Philly that won Car Crash Comedy, he backed  out, and now he's kind of trashing us, I'm hearing.  Is he really? 
[03:19:30]  Is he?  Yeah, let's go to Joe in Philly.  Joe, what's up?  Hello, Pete.  What's going on, man?  What's up, bitches?  Now, I see...  Even yesterday on Kid Chris, Ego McGonigal was talking about how you guys owe him money  for all the free publicity he's giving you guys down here.  Is that the little guy?  I owe him money.  Is he insane?  Wait, now, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  What's up?  This has come in a few times today.  Now, you've got to tell the truth on this one. 
[03:20:00]  Don't exaggerate or nothing.  What is he really...  I'm not exaggerating.  Levy and Chris and Thomas all spoke up for you guys.  Everybody was ripping on him.  They were talking about how they're going to drop him from their show and how...  I mean, I think they were busting his balls, but they were talking about how YSP's pissed  and they don't want him on any more Levy's gigs.  He honestly got it, said that you guys owe him money for the free publicity that he gave  you down there.  Yeah, because now I'm going to talk about it on Kid Chris for three days in a row.  But every time I talk about the winner from Car Crash Comedy in Philly, I forget the kid's 
[03:20:30]  name.  Is he the little guy, McConical?  Is he the little guy?  Yeah, he's like 4'10", maybe.  He's a tiny little guy.  With a horseshoe hairstyle there, and he's just awful.  He has to pay for sex and all, and we're giving him a great opportunity.  We got the winner right here on the phone, Seton Smith.  He went out in front of about, I don't know, 6,000 or 7,000, because people were still  coming in, and destroyed.  I think we should still let McConical do it.  He doesn't want to do it.  How can he not want to do Camden? 
[03:21:00]  He doesn't want to do it.  You know what it is?  I think he's scared, and he's trying to find an excuse to get out of it.  He's absolutely scared.  Yep.  What did he say?  He thinks it's too late now.  Levy was telling him to get back on, try and get back on, and everyone was telling  him it was too late.  Dude, we had patience with the guy, because we figured he was a little nervous, but now he's  he said something about having a mediocre career, and I don't know.  He's at the twilight of a mediocre career.  I don't know what it is.  I think we're going to pay him to do the show. 
[03:21:30]  Fuck pay.  Seton Smith.  Pay him.  Did you need money to open up in front of 6,000 or 7,000 people when you're usually doing  your comedy in front of 15?  Yeah.  I would have paid y'all a good amount of money.  Exactly!  To stand in front of that many white people and not be in a lineup.  What's the kind of lineup you're talking about?  Unless it's a Klan lineup.  I got to lack of height with ego.  Hey, can we get Kid Chris on the phone?  Is he up yet?  I want to get to the bottom of this Philly thing.  And we'll call Kid Chris today or something. 
[03:22:00]  Thanks, Joe.  Later.  But, Seton.  There's something wrong with that midget.  Seton, we just wanted to congratulate you again.  Everyone was talking about how great you did down there in Virginia.  And we'll have you on the show soon after break, okay?  All right, then, dawg.  Thank y'all.  Any plugs today?  Any plugs?  Damn it.  No, I'm in being Woodbridge, Virginia.  I have no plugs at all.  We got a MySpace or something?  Oh, yeah.  My bad.  Yeah.  Please, everybody.  Be my friend.  Seton Smith.  Yeah, MySpace forward slash Seton Smith. 
[03:22:30]  Be my friend.  See me do eight minutes on there.  Please do.  And also, yo, y'all making fun of Rich Voss because of the little spook line.  I want to let you know there's a bunch of ways y'all could have went with that.  You know what I mean?  So, you know, there's, for example, Klan people look like ghosts.  So, you could have been like, yeah, you know, I got my little Klan costume in the closet.  Right.  The Klan costume could have worked, too.  Yeah, you could have been like, oh, your friend, Ghost.  Perhaps I jumped the gun.  I thought black people were just afraid of being fathers.  You know, you could have just been somewhere, you know?  But, so, anyways, y'all, thank y'all for having me on the show.  Talk to y'all later. 
[03:23:00]  All right.  Thanks, man.  Seton Smith, everyone.  He said, what else did he say?  Charlie in Philly.  Smart guy.  Charlie.  Yo, Opie, Anthony, Jimmy, and Rich.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, just to add to little Ed McGonigal's conversation yesterday on Kid Chris.  He said that you guys should be thankful for his little controversy that he started up  because now you've got more people listening to your dopey little show.  Look, dude, he came in for car crash comedy. 
[03:23:30]  What is he talking about?  What a loser.  What's he trying to pull?  Some wacky comedy bit?  No, he was.  Where we talk about him?  I'll tell you what happened.  He tried to bow out because he was scared.  We called him out on it, and now he's trying to, you know, save face.  Yeah.  Thanks, Charlie.  Can you get him on the phone?  Don't we have his number to get him on the phone?  Mechanical?  He can only talk from 6 to like 6.20 or something crazy like that because he goes to work. 
[03:24:00]  So we're trying to get Kid Chris on.  We'll see what happens.  Hey, Evolution on Jill TV, Channel 11 here in New York, Anthony.  Hugo, lead singer.  He looks just like a young Steve Perry, especially.  A younger Steve Perry.  Yep.  Looks like Steve Perry, and it's a Journey cover band.  Yeah.  I guess they're doing cover band week because they had Bon Jovi guy on yesterday, and then  tomorrow they're having a U2 tribute band, but it's not 2U.  Why? 
[03:24:30]  I don't know.  Huh.  I don't know.  Didn't they do Channel 11 already?  I think Joe did.  I think so.  At some point.  The last time they did this.  Yeah.  So now they're doing Unforgettable Fire.  They had Green Day tribute band.  Yeah, they had a Green Day tribute band.  But today they had Yugo, my buddy Yugo there doing...  Evolution.  ...Journey.  Seaton is spelled S-E-T-O-N.  No.  No?  No?  It's S-E-A-T-O-N.  S-E-A? 
[03:25:00]  Oh, really?  Yes.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Fascinating.  Fuck.  S-E-A-T-O-N?  Yeah, I'll double check with it.  Okay.  Here's Evolution on TV this morning.  Sounds good so far.  Wow.  A little fast, actually.  Yeah, they probably had to fit it in at a certain time.  Just a small time ago 
[03:25:30]  Living in the only way  She took it in my train  Hey, kid.  Yo.  I'm sorry I haven't called your show.  I've been really busy this week.  I apologize.  That's all right, bro.  That's okay.  Maybe I'll try to give a call in this afternoon down there.  Okay.  What the fuck is going on?  We just had Seton Smith on, 
[03:26:00]  the guy who won Car Crash Comedy in Washington, D.C.  Yes.  And he won.  He went out there in front of 6,000, 7,000 people  and absolutely destroyed.  All the comedians were talking about him backstage  saying, wow, he took that opportunity  and he ran with it.  What's up with Ed?  I don't know, man.  He's on a high horse for some reason.  He can't get on a horse.  Now they've dubbed him as Ego McGonagall.  And yesterday he was saying on our show  that you guys need to thank him  for all the publicity he's getting you now. 
[03:26:30]  What are you talking about?  What is wrong with him?  What's the real deal?  You think he got nervous?  You know this guy pretty well.  Yeah, well, that's his thing.  You know what?  We noticed with him,  he starts to get a little arrogant,  but yet when he gets an opportunity,  he'll shoot it down so there's no room for failure.  Really?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  You know, so...  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  You know, I guess the guys are doing it forever. 
[03:27:00]  And here's the thing.  You know, one of his complaints was  he doesn't want to just give out his material for free,  but he'll do those open mics all week long.  Yeah, and this is in front of a huge crowd.  Yep.  In front of, you know, industry people.  I mean, I think it'd be a...  You know what?  Tell him I'll pay him out of my pocket if he does the show.  No, we don't fucking want him anymore.  Go fuck yourself, man.  Absolutely.  And for him to come up with an excuse  he wants to be paid for his material,  that's such a lame excuse. 
[03:27:30]  The guy got nervous,  so why don't you admit you're a pussy boy  and you didn't want to do it?  Yeah.  You know, I offered to pay him already too  out of my own pocket if he wouldn't do it.  Yeah, just to prove that he wouldn't do it.  It has nothing to do with money.  No, no.  And now he's kind of trashing us,  saying we have to thank him  for getting people to listen to our show.  He went on our show.  He knew about our show enough to do car crash comedy.  Yeah, well, you know,  it was in the paper yesterday  about how he bowed out of the thing  and then he called in yesterday saying that, 
[03:28:00]  you know, that you guys need to call him  and thank him for getting him in the paper.  Yeah, all right, whatever.  Yeah, I knew what he was going to say,  that he was dead.  You know what we're doing now, though?  We were only going to do one live show from Philly  before the comedy show on that Saturday.  Now we're coming down for two days  and one of the days we're dedicating to car crash comedy  to get a new winner.  Yeah.  Fuck Ed in the fuckhole.  Yeah, we'll do Kill Ed Day.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  But now it's an open call,  whether it's a comedian from the Philly area.  I don't give a shit.  If you're a comedian,  you could get to Philly  when we broadcast live from YSP that Friday,  which would be the 14th of September, I believe.  It is an open call now.  Yeah, good leprechaun.  I think we're doing it from a venue and everything  that holds about 1,000 people.  We're going to do car crash comedy  in front of like 1,000 people that Friday.  It'll be good.  And Philly will represent, you know that,  because Philly's vicious.  Oh, yeah.  So it'll be better now. 
[03:29:00]  This is actually very good.  Yeah, actually, it works out great for us.  But, Ed, what is wrong with you, man?  I'm not going to start saying he's not funny.  He's a funny guy.  We were impressed by him.  But, God, how lame, man.  You were nervous,  and instead of just backing out and saying so,  you're going to come up with some weird excuses?  Yeah, and then start trashing.  Well, the thing is, you know,  what pisses me off and frustrates me is  the opportunity is right there,  and it's a guy just pissing it away. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, here it is.  You know, your chance to be in front of a big crowd,  and he's scared of success, I guess.  Yeah, and if you think about it, too,  wasted a lot of people's time.  You know, there's a lot of comics there.  Yes, he certainly did.  I mean, if there's a lot of comics there  that, you know, woke up, came in to do it,  gave 110%, and then, you know,  and then Ed just got handed the ball,  and he just kind of dropped it.  I feel sorry for Geno.  I think Geno came in second place.  Yeah.  I mean, all those guys.  There was a lot of guys. 
[03:30:00]  Piscani, Piscani.  Piscani, yeah.  Yeah, all those guys got to be pissed.  Like, oh, what a tool.  Yeah, but, you know,  the comics won't trash other comics,  but they're all disappointed.  Hey, Kid Chris, you want to help be a judge that day?  Yes.  Yeah, we'll have, like,  hopefully, I mean, if we get the word out,  we'll get close to 1,000 people at a venue.  We're going to do the whole show that Friday,  and we're going to pick a new comedian  to open up the virus show.  Good.  Well, when you get the venue,  just make sure, you know,  I want to be all over it, 
[03:30:30]  so just tell me when you guys find out  where you're going to be.  Cool, man.  Yeah, Wise P's figuring it out, so.  Good.  Hey, Kid.  Yeah, good talking to you guys.  Does this count as a phone call to your show now?  Yes.  I'll just replay this.  I'll just replay this later.  Oh, you rock.  Just bleep out all the bad words.  That's what I was hoping for,  that you would go, ah, this.  I'm still not used to saying fuck and all that stuff.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, Chris.  That's strange.  Hey, Chris, it's for us.  Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame or not?  No. 
[03:31:00]  Hey, what's up, boss?  How's it going?  I'd say everyone knows.  Everybody here in the office just like,  oh, boss is in there?  Yeah.  The hot little girl that I used to date,  I showed my sneakers to.  Is she there now?  No, no.  Actually, she left.  She doesn't work with you guys anymore?  No, no.  She left.  You scared her off after that.  The shame.  She couldn't take the shame.  Wait, who was boss talking about?  Well, there was a sales chick here that he,  a couple years ago, I guess,  tried to date,  and when he took her out,  he showed her his trunk full of sneakers. 
[03:31:30]  I took my car off.  What is wrong with you, Rich?  She probably thought he was going to  slam the truck on her head and throw her in.  Oh, wow.  Ass.  We're over this Ed dude, though.  I mean, you know,  I'm not going to play his game anymore.  Yeah, fuck him.  It's a lost cause,  because now he's just, you know,  on his horse,  and, you know,  he'll just be playing spaghetti warehouses 
[03:32:00]  for the rest of his life.  It's too bad,  because he's a funny midget,  but we've got to move on  and get another winner now,  so that's what we'll do.  The show must go on.  We'll do an extra day in Philly,  and we'll get a new winner  for the, you know,  the virus tour,  September 15th in Camden.  Cool, boss.  You should come try out.  Now, what spaghetti places  are doing comedy?  Yeah, Rich wants to know a list.  Give him the numbers.  All right, well,  it was good talking to you guys, man.  Absolutely, kid.  And keep me in the loop 
[03:32:30]  on where you're going to be doing this,  you know,  the new comedy thing  when you guys come to town,  and we'll be all over it.  Hell yeah.  I think you're going to know  before we do,  because they're working on that,  and they're going to tell us.  Okay, all right, good.  Well, then I'll call  and fill you guys in  when I find out.  Kid Chris,  Afternoons,  YSP,  for everybody in the Philly area  listening on XM right now.  See you guys.  Thanks, sir.  All right, see you.  Bye.  He's funny, man.  He's a good egg.  He's funny,  has a lot of energy,  and man,  he loves fucking with O.J. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  Loves the O.J.  All right.  Oh, that's right.  They need to turn the vocals up a bit.  Well, they're a new stage.  Something tells me they're not really,  yeah, they can't really mix a band very well.  That sucks,  because his voice,  in the news.  His voice,  that mix isn't doing it justice,  unfortunately.  I mean,  it still sounds really good.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:33:30]  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  A singer in a spoken room  In the style I had cheap life in you  For a star that could share the night 
[03:34:00]  Because I want my girl  Trying to die with me  Looking at the blue behind the shadows  Yeah, that's churning.  I'm going to try to go with the Sopranos ending here.  Hold on.  I'm going to try to go with the Sopranos ending here.  I'm going to try to die with you  There's a Sopranos shining party  Sopranos ending here. 
[03:34:30]  That's going to take to one, all right?  Yeah.  He hit the note, though.  Yeah.  The mix sucks.  Yeah, it's a bad mix, but he did just hit that.  But Hugo's amazing when he does his Sopran impression there.  That's Evolution.  They were on Jill TV this morning, Channel 11 here in New York.  Jill TV.  Can't wait to see Jill at our show.  Yes.  Supposedly she'll be there Saturday, right?  Yeah.  Oh, what a great line.  Steve from Basher, of course. 
[03:35:00]  He writes, this is not a surprise.  Ed also gave up growing at the age of seven.  You guys had an eye on?  That's the line.  No.  No, I talked to Kid Chris, though.  I just did a Mike Gallagher, and we just brief chit-chat.  He was very, very cool.  He said very nice things about you guys.  Very nice things.  Oh, did he?  Yes.  Okay.  Give me something specific.  Those guys are geniuses at what they do.  Oh, what?  He said he said that on Fox.  Off the air.  No, no, no.  He said that on Fox, and he got...  Because I wasn't particularly funny on his show.  I just kind of talked.  Because, again, I could see he was really... 
[03:35:30]  He's got a tremendous...  A little scared.  Yeah, but he likes me, and he likes the show.  And he said he's a fan of the show, and he likes what you guys do.  And he said, I get in trouble with Fox.  I was like, these guys are geniuses at what they do.  And he just...  He said it's not just shock.  He spoke very hard of you.  Oh, that's nice.  Yes.  So it's nice to know.  It's not just...  Look at this cushy fucking radio DJ fest we're having here.  But it's rare, though.  It's rare.  There's so many conflicts and problems with guys like Neil Bortz.  Bortz.  And guys that attack the show. 
[03:36:00]  It's nice to have...  Guys that are supportive.  Some allies in the business.  Helps.  The listeners, they just help us when we don't get the obvious.  What happened?  You know, we get tired after doing almost five hours of radio a day.  What happened?  A bird from Philly.  He's quoting Voss when Voss said, I'm not breathing, am I?  Yes.  We're all amazed you made to 50 years without forgetting, dummy.  We noticed that Voss was going...  I didn't realize...  I wasn't that bad. 
[03:36:30]  It was pretty bad.  You know Ed McConical?  Is that his name?  What is it?  McConical?  Yes.  A douchebag.  I think his phone call right before he got nervous was, all right, Jimmy, I'll talk  to you later, Schubert, and hung up and said, you know what?  Maybe not.  Oh, boy.  I think he was just bashing you.  No, he wasn't.  No, I didn't think he was.  He said Jimmy and Schubert.  He over-explained it.  Hey, no filter Paul helping us out.  He has the I love my dick, that clip up on break.com and YouTube, and he added a very 
[03:37:00]  small opianthony.com logo.  So, make sure you search that out today.  Yeah.  All right.  We finally got that up there.  We interrupt this program for a midget sighting.  Oh, I don't like that.  I don't have my thing.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Chris in Arizona, what's up?  Got a midget sighting for Jimmy.  Okay.  I was hitting an A.  Meanwhile, back...  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  I'm not good at this.  I'm nervous. 
[03:37:30]  Go ahead.  My stomach's turn.  Jimmy, your turn.  I was at a meeting on Monday up in Scottsdale, and I look over, and I see this guy with  his head on the table, and I'm thinking, well, that's not uncommon at a meeting.  You know, people get upset.  Maybe he's new.  And I realized his head was on the table because he was sitting on his chair, and he was sitting  about as upright as he could get.  Oh, you thought he was leaning his head on the table.  I thought he was, like, had his head on his arms, but he was actually...  That's how tall he was.  He was just, like, chin-level with the table.  So, you know, I'm thinking, hey, I've got to have some sympathy.  I don't want to go there. 
[03:38:00]  I end up in the small discussion group with him, and he's telling all about his sponsorship  and all this, and I'm just looking at him thinking, oh, my God, I've got to call  ONA.  Sorry, we're distracted by the glacier surfing video.  Wow.  But it's fake.  It's fake.  You think this is fake?  Yeah, it's got to be fake.  Wait, Fox News is reporting it.  It's got to be real.  No, but they just said, is it real?  And why is that?  Look at the watermark in the middle there.  It's fake.  The big graphic.  Look, it's fake. 
[03:38:30]  I didn't know it's fake.  It's glacier water.  Because, first of all, the guy...  See the back?  Yeah, it's glacier water.  And it just doesn't look real.  Like the water...  I don't know.  It didn't look real.  But it has to be, because now they're interviewing the kid.  And he's going, it's really hot out here.  My balls itch.  The first seen riding wave after glacier collapse.  Wow, that's a pretty cool video.  Yeah, but he was being towed by a jet ski, and then all of a sudden a glacier just kind  of collapses.  They probably knew it was going. 
[03:39:00]  Perfect timing.  You kind of know when those things are about to fall.  What is it?  Give or take 5,000 years?  Jesus Christ.  Good point.  Good point.  That thing has been pulling him since 1971.  Back at the show.  Ah.  Ah, whatever.  That's fake.  You're right.  Came back to the show and fucked up his midget sighting.  I'm sorry about that.  Doesn't look real.  Rich Voss at the Improv in Pittsburgh Labor Day weekend.  It's time for some highlights of the day.  Ow.  Is that what we're calling it now?  Yeah.  Ow.  I was thinking about it on the way home. 
[03:39:30]  It's not line of the day anymore.  I still like line of the day, because even though...  I like the fact they play it in context.  How about this?  Line of the day within proper context, yet line still withstanding.  How about line of the day, sometimes paragraph of the day?  I like that.  Line of the day, semicolon, but occasionally other things.  However, context will be included.  I like that.  Of the day.  Of the day.  Exclamation point. 
[03:40:00]  Question mark.  Here comes.  And then you say all that.  Does everyone have their stickers out?  I have my unicorn stickers.  That's right, Jimmy.  They're very sparkly.  I have Care Bears.  Care Bears.  And I got...  That's good.  I have Care Bears wearing slippers.  I got smiley faces.  Ooh, Voss.  Got a call.  Voss is calling.  Nothing important.  Who's on the phone?  He's hoping he answered it.  I'm Care Bears.  They're mechanical.  Ed McDonicle?  Jesus.  What is he, want to fucking give you a burger and fries? 
[03:40:30]  Is it Ed McConicle or Ed McDonicle?  We're seeing none of the above.  Ed McIdiacle.  Ed Burger Kingable.  Ed McWendy's?  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  What we did was we propped the door up and had dining room chairs angled at a way to hold the door into the fridge.  By the way, speaking of the war...  I think you should have even when it is working.  Barricaded. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, wait.  That was a damn good one.  A little unicorn?  There it is.  It's a runner-up, so you only get one.  Yeah, I know.  Line of the day gets two.  Yeah.  Two stickers for line of the day.  Yes.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Chinese democracy.  Let's go.  It's not even relevant anymore.  How about ten minutes after the guy got a tank on his foot?  That'd be a good time.  Old tank chest.  I think that's when he decided to write the...  Why did you leave me in there?  Just fucking up his line.  You're going to help me out and make me look like a professional broadcaster that listens. 
[03:41:30]  Jimmy?  Yes.  I did it already.  Oh, I see.  Very good.  Yes.  My Care Bears sticker.  Here's another...  I like the Care Bears.  They make me feel good about myself.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  What's with your choppers?  Her teeth was throwing gang signs.  I gotta say, I don't know how any...  Wow, I don't know how you beat that.  That's Rampage Jackson.  Damn Rampage Jackson line was great. 
[03:42:00]  Talking about very crooked teeth, obviously, back there in Japan.  How did...  Wow, you guys got some confidence in that.  Let's see.  We got two more.  All right, here's another and the final...  I guess the final runner-up line.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Rampage isn't here.  So can I take his Care Bears sticker?  No.  No.  Please?  Goes unclaimed.  Unclaimed.  Okay.  Care Bears stickers.  Put it up on the Bolton board.  Okay.  For next time he's back.  That's right.  All right.  Here's the final runner-up line of the day. 
[03:42:30]  Let me ask you...  Here you go.  I could leave.  I think I know what he did.  Like, whenever he opens the refrigerator, he's so happy.  He says, baby, make a Fridgie ride.  He hops on it.  Then he goes back and forth.  And his girlfriend has to go, could you please get off that?  You're going to break it.  That was funny, Joey.  Yeah.  You get another one.  That's two Care Bears stickers in my notebook.  Rich, anything else?  No.  No.  Sweetie.  Do you feel like a beaten man every time you leave here? 
[03:43:00]  Have I really?  No.  Because great minds think occasionally.  No.  What did he say?  Great minds think a lot.  Think a lot.  That might be line of the day.  You can't not love Voss.  That might be line of the day right there.  It's mind-boggling.  Unless you're Bonnie.  Well, Bonnie was great because she said that Voss doesn't understand privacy.  And, like, he'll say something stupid and she'll kick him and he'll go, why'd you kick me?  Wow.  Beautiful baby, by the way.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course.  And Voss is such a detached zilch. 
[03:43:30]  Oh.  Hello?  Antiradio.net.  Anti?  Yeah.  Hi.  I think he called me another thing yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Let's do that.  Yeah, have fun.  I guess he got us.  Well, maybe it's a good site.  Is there anything interesting on it or is it just some jerk-off with a bunch of links? 
[03:44:00]  Some jerk-off.  Is it?  I would think.  All right.  Well, then maybe a lot of our listeners want to go to this fucking Mavericksantiradio.net  site and see what they think of it.  I don't even get it.  Exactly.  Something to do with an internet show, I guess.  He's trying to drive traffic.  It's a podcast.  A podcast.  All right.  Well, maybe a lot of listeners want to go and check out this guy's podcaster.  Just rip up his bandwidth.  Have fun.  Crash his site.  I'm giving a gold star to Bill from Waterford today. 
[03:44:30]  I'm going to give one to Steve from Bayshore.  Steve always gets one.  And I'm just going to randomly give one to Dogshit Sniffer.  Why?  It's not his real name.  Because it was a random one.  All right.  I'm not taking it seriously.  And I'm going to give a gold star to Brian in St. Louis.  Yes.  That's what I do today.  All right.  Line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:45:00]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  We'll see.  Great minds think a lot.  I like.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I'm going to get.  Great minds think a lot.  Technically correct.  I didn't.  Yes.  Yes.  No.  What was the noise at the end?  Anthony.  Play it.  What was it?  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  I can't believe I said duh. 
[03:45:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  That was a highlight right there.  You ready, Kenneth?  Oh, you guys got a goal.  We got a fuck.  Oh, Jimmy's got a goal.  What a day we had.  We take the train to Boston.  I do torture and rich from 520 to 5 o'clock.  And then I go over to Bands and Nobles and Bollison Street.  You know, the Prudential Center.  And I sign hot meetings.  And I take Tyra back to be late and then do the show tomorrow.  Why don't you fly?  Why are you taking the train?  Because I don't have wings.  Choo, choo.  Hey, Kenny, you sleeping over tonight? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  I think Kenny's sleeping over.  We're having a sleepover tonight.  What?  Yeah, where are you going to sleep?  I actually thought of offering you my couch.  This fucking guy, man.  I got a guest room now, right?  And it's all set up nice.  New bed.  New blankets.  New pillows.  New sheets.  Everything's new.  And washed.  So why won't he stay over?  Because you guys are getting back from Boston, what?  Midnight?  Somewhere around there?  Midnight area, yeah.  And Kenny goes, I'll just sleep in the car and then, you know, come get you in the morning.  I'm like, no, just sleep in my place. 
[03:46:30]  I got a room for you.  And he refuses.  What's wrong?  Just leave a key so you don't wake him or lift you up?  He's charging me rent.  Why won't you sleep over?  That I don't get.  I don't get it.  All right, you'll see tonight.  Are you going to sleep over?  Yeah, you'll see why.  Uh-oh.  Why?  Because you shit the bed a lot?  He gets really, he always has dreams.  Then he's in a pudding eating contest.  And he wakes up with his hands shaking and his toes pointed out, just shitting angrily.  Oh, help me. 
[03:47:00]  The best thing about that was he said, he shits a lot.  Like, whether you shit a lot or not, once you shit the bed, you shit the bed.  Yeah, I know, but I've had smudges on the bed.  And then there's the times where, like, I thought it was a fart, and I pumped out about five gallons of fucking liquid venison.  Is it your snoring, Kenny?  Kenny, do you snore loud?  Yeah, I snore very loud.  Yeah.  I won't bother him from the guest room.  We're really scared that he's going to, like, put on his big boy pajamas and then crawl into bed with us because he sleepwalks. 
[03:47:30]  I'm scared.  With his giant thighs.  Can I sleep with you?  Well, you wake up, and you see him, like, your feet are sticking out, and he's jerking off looking at your toes.  Sorry, G.H.  But, yeah, just make sure they leave a key.  You've got to leave a key and a permission to enter.  He already has a key.  He's ready to roll, and I know he's not going to use it.  I just know.  Open the door quietly and go to bed.  What's wrong with you?  Why wouldn't you?  Yeah, he goes, I don't want to disturb you.  You know what?  He's right.  It's hard to sleep in someone's house. 
[03:48:00]  Not a guest room.  It's not, though.  I'd rather sleep in the car.  All right, Rich, here's what we've got to do.  You're rather sleep in a car?  Why?  So you smell in the morning.  Kenny has to get up.  A hotel.  Kenny has to get up, and he has to wake Opie up, make sure Opie's up for the thing.  So what if Kenny oversleeps?  It's important.  It's important.  Sleep in the car.  It'll be a night to remember.  All right, well, we'll have to hear about it.  I want to hear about it.  It'll be important.  Important.  Just get it ready.  He'll be fine.  His sleeping will not.  G.H., I made you breakfast. 
[03:48:30]  I know.  You need your nutrition.  Fucking.  Probably in his underwear making fucking eggs.  Flapjacks.  Flapjacks or something with an apron on.  There's fucking 6'5 creep.  Big pubes in them.  They got you a fruit plate.  A ball of rotted blueberries.  All right.  All right.  We're all babbling.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Done.  Have fun in Boston.  We'll see you tomorrow morning.  We'll get the full report tomorrow, Rich.  We didn't want to miss our last day of radio. 
[03:49:00]  And, Voss, when are you at Labor Day?  Where are you going to be?  Pittsburgh?  Pittsburgh.  Improv.  And tomorrow's the big day.  We, we, we, we, we, we.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We, we.  Exactly.  We feed Sam steak tomorrow.  Yes.  Steak and rice tomorrow.  Eat it.  McFoley will be doing that tomorrow.  One of the many things we got planned for the last show before vacation.  Indeed.  Drew Boogie coming in.  I think we're doing Rap Wars tomorrow.  Rap Wars tomorrow, too?  I believe so.  We haven't really promoted it, but we'll do that on the XM side tomorrow.  That should be really good as well.  Lots to do tomorrow.  Guys, have a great day. 
[03:49:30]  We'll see you tomorrow.  Hi, this is Louis Guzmang, and you're listening to my pal, Little Joey Norton.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Right on.  Nightly News, you know.  I thought I could do a one-cheek sneak.  The war in Iraq.  Excuse me.  And other.  Excuse me.  Social Security is a fucking hard part. 
[03:50:00]  Wait.  Does someone have some, a breeze for my chair?  Oh.  Uh, wardrobe?  Could we get a wardrobe down here to fix something?  Wait.  I need a wardrobe.  Open in Anthony. </pre>
