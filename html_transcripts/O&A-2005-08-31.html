<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with typical chaotic banter, including jokes about bodily functions and a bizarre “robbery rape” invitation.  The conversation quickly shifted to a serious discussion of Hurricane Katrina’s aftermath, focusing heavily on criticism of President George W. Bush’s response and the sensationalized news coverage.  Opie and Anthony voiced strong disapproval of Bush's leadership and speeches,  analyzing the graphic nature of news reports.  A caller, Ron from Tennessee, mentioned a news report about a shark in the New Orleans streets (later attributed to a damaged aquarium).  The hosts then debated the morality of looting in New Orleans, differentiating between looting for survival and the theft of non-essential items.

A lengthy call with Tom, a New Orleans listener, provided a harrowing firsthand account of the devastation: flooding, downed trees, lack of services, encounters with looters, and the sight of bodies.  The show then veered into a discussion of a racially insensitive comedian, followed by Anthony’s incredulous recounting of a bizarrely positive interaction with an overly-enthusiastic cab driver who gave him a lengthy, oddly worded thank-you note.  The broadcast concluded with a return to the Hurricane Katrina discussion and the ongoing crisis in New Orleans.

A later segment began with darkly humorous speculation about a cab driver’s past, followed by an anecdote about another cab driver who showed them accident photos, leading to a suggestion to invite him on the show.  The hosts then discussed bizarre items on their desks (a “Mr. Weenie” sweatshirt, cheerleader magazines, etc.). A caller challenged Jimmy’s description of the Japanese flag, prompting a recurring comedic bit.  The conversation returned to Hurricane Katrina, with criticism of the media’s prolonged focus on the crisis even as conditions improved.  A live interview with a young man in New Orleans painted a picture of chaos, looting, violence, and rape.  A news report detailed the extent of the flooding and suffering. The segment further discussed logistical challenges of rescue and relocation, including speculation about using cruise ships for evacuees.  The segment concluded with more Katrina discussion, including a psychologist's comments on the psychological impact on survivors.

Another segment primarily focused on the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, with Wendy from Louisiana describing the shift from initial chaotic behavior to somber acceptance of the devastation.  A heartbreaking audio clip of a man searching for his missing wife was played. The show also discussed the lack of international aid, contrasted with US criticism during other global disasters.  Opie and Anthony promoted an upcoming anniversary show and Halloween party, and briefly mentioned an upcoming Johnny Cash biopic.  Callers shared their experiences, including the challenges of evacuation, looting, and media coverage. One caller recounted drinking sewage as a child.  A heated exchange occurred with a caller, Frank, about the hosts' charitable contributions and their on-air expression of concern. The segment concluded with discussions about truckers impacted by fuel prices and future programming plans. A sexually suggestive song ("Mound Wednesday") was played.

A further segment addressed listener feedback criticizing their hurricane jokes, with the hosts defending their humor as targeting the news coverage, not the victims.  A caller, Calvin, a truck driver, jokingly claimed to be spreading a virus.  A further update from Tom in New Orleans described worsening conditions.  Opie and Anthony offered to help him evacuate.  The show then discussed the mass evacuation from the New Orleans Superdome to the Houston Astrodome, highlighting logistical challenges.  A caller, Jim, complimented their Monday coverage.  An interview with Ashley Markison, searching for her missing husband, followed. Bob, another caller, described his storm injuries, including glass in his buttocks.  A segment featured two women from GotchaGirls.com, who performed a simulated breast milk squirting prank. They discussed their pranks and encounters with law enforcement. A caller shared a story of getting out of a speeding ticket by flirting with a police officer.  "The Rocker's" a cappella audition tape was played and critiqued.  The show ended with a “What Did We Learn Today?” segment.

A final, brief excerpt described a crudely humorous anecdote involving a quick, impersonal sexual act between a man and a driver through a car window at a gas station in a location referenced only as "성."  The dialogue was highly vulgar and sexually explicit.

[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And he's stinky.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  This show is a disaster.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  Water will seek its own level.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:04:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  Hi.  XM Satellite Radio.  Want to get right into it because we're all watching the coverage.  Yeah, we're watching the coverage of Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath, O.P.  Now it's all about the aftermath.  Wow.  I went home yesterday after the show.  I've been watching the coverage probably for the last 16 to 18 hours.  Can't get enough.  16 to 18 straight hours. 
[00:05:00]  Whatever they do that we goof on all the time, it works.  Because I just tune in.  I can't get enough.  I'm watching the helicopter rescues.  And I need to know where the levee's broken.  What are they doing about it?  What's destroyed?  Yeah, they don't have to throw the fear factor in.  It's already there.  It's well established, you know.  Now they pretty much have a catastrophe that they can just report.  Yeah, now they just go with the flow.  They don't have to do the scare tactics. 
[00:05:30]  Make stuff up.  Or, yeah, throw the fear in there.  It's just a disaster.  It's a mess.  Personally, I don't think New Orleans ever recovered.  Ever?  I don't know, man.  What business is going to want to rebuild there, knowing that this could happen maybe a year from now?  Maybe five?  Maybe ten?  You know, in this case, what?  They went 30-some-odd years between these devastating hurricanes.  But there's nothing they can do about it, really.  It's amazing. 
[00:06:00]  The one thing I want to say right off the bat, CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, the local news,  they've got to calm down with the graphics, saying they're the one for the coverage.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're Hurricane Center, I think is what CNN's calling themselves.  Hurricane Center.  What the hell does that even mean?  I don't know.  Yeah, they want to make it sound like they're the ones.  Truth of the matter is, when one goes to commercials, boom, I'm off to another.  When one gets in other news today, boom, I'm gone. 
[00:06:30]  Exactly.  When someone gets some talking head up there that's babbling about something I don't want to hear,  boom, I'm off to the next one.  That's how it works.  Good to see that President Bush cut his vacation short two days.  Thank you, sir.  You're a true leader.  I hear there was trouble.  You're a true leader of this fine country.  I hear they got a little rain down there.  Go check it out.  I was telling Anthony, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, whatever, I just hate this fucking guy. 
[00:07:00]  I can't stand him as a leader.  I think anyone who's listened to this program for any length of time pretty much knows where  each of us as individuals stands on political things, and I lean a little right.  I'm a moderate.  But I got to tell you, this guy is just a horse's ass.  He has nothing to say.  This is like...  He's got nothing, period.  This is rivaling 9-11.  You understand that.  That'll be decided down the road if this is as big, whatever. 
[00:07:30]  But it's up there.  There's a major, major thing happening.  And as a leader of the country, he has nothing to say.  Back in the day, Reagan would look you in the eye and show a little tear and a little human emotion  where you felt like someone was in charge.  We'll stand together as a country and we'll help them.  Nancy, I forgot my diities.  Could you?  Oh, poor dead guy.  Can't even do the Reagan anymore.  Feel bad that he's dead. 
[00:08:00]  Why?  Go ahead, bully.  Keep picking on the dead guy.  I know.  Pick on the dead guy.  And, yeah, he's done nothing.  Last night, I'm kind of listening to his speech.  Can we get some Bush audio?  If we can find Bush audio, please, please get it.  I'm listening to his speech and I'm going, you know something?  And I really start thinking about what he's done in office since he's been there.  What he has actually done as president.  And all I could come up with is the war.  That's pretty much it. 
[00:08:30]  That war is such a focal point to him that nothing else really matters.  I don't know if it's calculated or he just doesn't know how to do anything else.  Because it's just that, everything else.  Talk to your buddies in Saudi Arabia, in OPEC, and have them increase oil production.  Pressure the motherfuckers to do that.  Send Condoleezza Rice over there.  Have her chat with these people.  Increase oil production so the price goes down.  The price of the gas these days has nothing to do with, we're running out of oil. 
[00:09:00]  No.  It has to do with these greedy motherfuckers in OPEC.  That's what it is.  And what has he done?  Nothing.  The guy has made no effort to put pressure on these motherfuckers to bring the oil prices down.  And now he got this to deal with.  And he decides to cut his vacation short.  Gee, thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks for throwing us a bone.  And then what just pissed me off to no end last night.  I'm watching his speech about World War II ending in Japan. 
[00:09:30]  He gets up there.  There's a bunch of World War II vets standing there.  And he goes on.  Instead of just using that moment to pay tribute to the soldiers of World War II that saved the world, he turns it into a fucking Iraq agenda speech to justify the war because it's so much like our victory in Japan.  And he's trying to make this correlation between the two. 
[00:10:00]  Every, not even just this passing little thing where you might go, hmm, was that a slight hint to the Iraq thing?  Every line out of his mouth was a linking between our victory in Japan in World War II and Iraq.  The kamikaze suicide bombers, he says, trying to link up like we had it back then, same thing.  And we didn't treat them as a conquered people.  We went in there and rebuilt a democracy for Japan. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, and I'm sitting there going, wow, this is fucking subtle.  We get it.  You're trying to make the comparison.  And it ain't working.  This ass, instead of just paying tribute to the heroes of World War II, the guy turns it into another one of these look-what-I'm-doing agendas.  He's an asshole.  An asshole.  And no, I'm the furthest thing from a liberal you're ever going to see. 
[00:11:00]  But that doesn't mean I can't call this guy a douchebag who's doing nothing.  All right, why don't we, I don't even know where to begin.  The phones have exploded.  Let's go to Ron in Tennessee.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Ron.  Hey, did you see the reports they just had on Fox about 30 minutes ago that they said there was a shark swimming in the streets of New Orleans?  Only Fox, man.  Yeah, thanks to Fox.  It's not bad enough.  They got to now tell everyone that there may be sharks in the water. 
[00:11:30]  In the streets of New Orleans.  They had to wait 30 minutes just to say, well, we got reports now that it comes from an aquarium down there now.  Yeah, it's probably a dead shark.  There is no shark that is going to survive for any length of time in, like, fresh sewage water.  Well, they were saying something like it had come up through the Mississippi and jumped in somehow.  I don't know.  Sure it did.  Yeah, but now they have to worry about maybe a shark attack.  You know, calm down, Fox.  Yeah, stop. 
[00:12:00]  You got enough stuff to go.  It's bad enough.  Oh, that's a cool sight right there.  Cops holding a shotgun on a bunch of looters.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, thanks, bro.  Well, the looting thing is very interesting.  I was getting really pissed off watching the coverage last night because not a lot of reporters  brave enough to, you know, talk about the looting in a way that made sense, okay?  Even Sean Hannity, like, kind of disappointed me last night.  They're showing looters in grocery stores and stuff like that.  And these people, for the most part, are going through the grocery stores out of necessity, 
[00:12:30]  trying to find food and fresh water.  These guys, they've taken an entire section of a supermarket.  Well, that's a little...  An entire produce thing.  All right, well, that guy, you know, that was a little over the top.  Okay, just...  Cops are manhandling these guys.  Just as I'm trying to make my point, that didn't help that piece of video.  Well, I think there was food on it, though.  There was food on it.  Yeah, but there was a lot of...  I mean, how much food...  Jeez, stop it.  How many freaking peaches can you possibly eat?  See, you need all of them.  Right.  Leave some for some other looters. 
[00:13:00]  But finally, someone...  I forgot what channel, because like we said,  yesterday, they're all the same channel.  They do the exact same crap.  So, you know, they want us to think one's better than the other.  But in reality, they're not.  They're all the same shit.  Finally, though, some of these guys were getting on TV going,  Look, they're looting the supermarkets, because they have no choice.  They don't have fresh water.  They don't have food.  You know, and you made a good point in the office.  Most of this food's going bad anyway.  Yeah, it's not like if they weren't looting it, that the shop owner is returning that afternoon 
[00:13:30]  to open up the store and crank up the cash registers and start selling his food.  All right, and there's the footlocker.  So now the one guy was making that point, which kind of made sense, okay, to me anyway.  But then he goes, but what I don't understand is seeing 30 guys breaking through the front window of footlocker  and, you know, stealing all the sneakers in the store.  Yeah, stealing the sneakers.  So at least the guy was making, you know, making a comparison there.  Like this is, you can understand this, but obviously you can't understand this. 
[00:14:00]  The electronic stores, too.  Right, right.  Breaking into electronic stores.  Oh, they're pretty much breaking everywhere.  Stealing that.  But as far as the food goes, food and water, it's, you know, right now they're put in a situation where it's survival.  Of course you take food.  You take as much food as you think you're going to need to get yourself out of that area.  It will get spoiled there, too, quickly.  Yeah.  It's 90 degrees over there.  What do you think?  They have no refrigeration.  If they don't take it, it's going to go bad.  They might as well take the food. 
[00:14:30]  Sneakers.  Like sneakers, stop.  Right.  The electronic stores, stop it.  Right.  What are you doing?  Flooded streets, sneakers.  What good are new sneakers?  They're worthless.  Well, if you take boxes and boxes of them and cart them away in some kind of apparatus that keeps it out of the water,  then when everything's said and done, you can then sell them, is what I believe they were doing.  All right.  We got the audio on this, Shark.  Oh, we do.  It's good.  Some residents who had not yet fled reported yesterday seen in the streets of New Orleans sharks. 
[00:15:00]  I'm kidding.  No.  A report of sharks in the street.  Well, I guess you could figure that out by saying Gulf of Mexico.  Oh, absolutely.  Swimming in through the Mississippi River, making their way in there right now.  Well, I mean, how weird was it a day before there were white caps on Canal Street?  Calm down, Fox.  You've got enough to go with.  White caps on Canal Street.  You don't need to go with the shark angle.  The sharks. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, a dead shark floating around the street.  That's what happens.  These aquariums that they got there seem to have overflowed and put some of the wildlife in the streets.  Speaking of that, I guess we've got to start writing down the channels where we're hearing this stuff.  Yeah.  But one of the channels this morning as we're getting ready for the show was talking about all the devastation in Biloxi, Mississippi.  Yep.  Basically, the city, the town, whatever they call it down there, it's completely gone.  Yeah, it's gone. 
[00:16:00]  The new footage that you'll see this morning, it's pretty much completely gone.  Man, there's just lumber fields.  Yeah.  I mean, you can't even tell where neighborhoods were anymore or houses.  Yeah, they were showing some of the houses in the outskirts of New Orleans and other cities that kind of blew off their foundation.  And it looks like they took a house and just dropped it in the middle of the road or there's a roof lying somewhere.  The houses in Biloxi just pulverized.  It was just splinters.  You couldn't make out that it was even a house.  And just bare foundations and individual planks of lumber. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  That was it.  So they're showing all that devastation.  And then they showed an aerial view of, I guess, the aquarium down there that was completely destroyed.  Yeah.  And the stupid anchor woman had to say, you know, and some of the animals had to be destroyed.  Had to be destroyed.  She sounded very somber when she said it.  It was very somber, like, you know, thinking maybe all the death and destruction of human life wasn't good enough.  Maybe we should also let the viewers know that cute little animals that we enjoy are no longer around because they had to be destroyed. 
[00:17:00]  No one cares as much for people as they do a cuddly little seal.  Cute little seal.  Hmm.  And Ant made another good point.  Ant was just on fire with your good points in the office.  Oh, I was watching all the news last night.  Well, the Biloxi thing, you know, they're just showing just barges that used to be in the water that are now, what, a quarter mile on land? 
[00:17:30]  At least a quarter mile.  Some of these things.  It's so odd to see a barge carrying cars.  There was this barge with cars on it and big containers.  And it was in the woods.  Just dropped in the woods somewhere.  How do you get that ship in the woods?  Fifty train cars.  Train cars.  In the middle of the woods now.  Just dumped around in the woods, in fields, people's backyards. 
[00:18:00]  You see boats.  An entire marina full of sailboats, powerboats, just dumped on top of houses in people's backyards.  Casinos, those offshore casinos, the ones that just sit there right on the beach.  Completely pulverized.  And we're sitting in the office and you've got to think, where do you start?  Do you go, all right, let's get that blue Chevy.  Uh, we'll put it over there. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, because where do you put all this stuff?  And then we'll work on the 500 locomotives.  Where do you start?  Someone get the bridge out of the water.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to get these huge concrete sections, tons of concrete highway.  Yeah, we'll start there.  You four, you collect all the cars.  Yeah.  You're on car detail.  How do you clean it up?  How do you start?  You know, you could work for weeks and not even make a dent. 
[00:19:00]  Not even make a dent.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom in New Orleans.  An old friend of the show.  He's been with us off and on for years.  Tom, we were worried about you.  Yeah, we couldn't get you on the phone last night or this morning.  Fuck, dude, it's hot.  Yeah?  How are you doing?  What's around your general location?  What's going on?  What do you know?  It's just that there was a shark.  I think it came from Lake Pontchartrain, because the National Guard guys gave me a ride to another 
[00:19:30]  friend's house to restock, get some beer.  He's out of town.  The National Guard is getting you your beer?  Yeah, he gave me a ride, but we couldn't get all the way through.  So I had to go for the rest of the way, and then we walked back.  This is a different time, everyone.  Three-foot shark, they said.  About two and a half, three feet.  That was just swimming down a causeway in Metair.  Scared the shit out of them.  And now, the area you're in, how's the flooding?  Is it rising?  Is it going down? 
[00:20:00]  It went down a good bit yesterday, but like I just, Danny Colvin woke me up.  I went outside a little bit and looked, and it's looking kind of better, but they say it's  supposed to be coming back up because the 17th Street Canal, a big piece of levee broke.  Yeah, that's how I started the show, because I was watching footage of that, and I could  not believe the water just pouring out of that.  They say it's like a hundred...  Yeah, New Orleans is the actual city.  I mean, I'm hoping we're so far out in the burbs that it won't get to us.  I'm hoping that. 
[00:20:30]  But it looks like the water's pretty much down.  We walked to my house yesterday.  I didn't get any water in it.  It came right to my door, but one of my pine trees crashed.  Just missed my roof.  It hit like the patio cover.  Fence went down.  Looks like a fucking tornado hit it.  But at least I got a roof and no water damage.  Don't sound as bad as what we've been seeing.  It's hot, dude.  We're down about seven beers.  Ice is probably gone by now.  What are you doing about water and food? 
[00:21:00]  Well, we're going to have to cook every last thing in the food ice chest today.  We've been barbecuing.  I mean, we had...  My mom's got like three freezers, and they're stacked with shit, and the gas grill's still on.  So we have to cook everything today, because we need no more ice.  Now, what about running water?  We got about 20 gallons, five-gallon jugs of bottled water.  20 gallons.  And what are you going to do?  Because obviously, they're not going to be turning this stuff on before you run out. 
[00:21:30]  I don't know.  I mean, I'm trying to decide if the water goes down.  I should have got three quarters of a tank of gas.  Do you have a contingency plan to leave?  Where are you going to go?  Can you get out?  I don't know if I can get out right now.  He's got a car.  He's got a little bit of gas in it.  But you don't know if any of the roads are passable.  Right.  When I walked to my house, I was in waist-deep water going there.  So I was like, oh, fuck.  I'm going to be underwater.  But oddly enough, I guess I was on high ground. 
[00:22:00]  But I mean, if all that water goes down and there's fish all over, I mean, we caught.  We kicked them back in, because we have enough fish in the freezer that's already clean.  But we caught, like, speckled trout with our foot just walking, like, through the golf course.  Really?  There's just fish everywhere?  It's drying out, so we might go.  There's one good hole out there.  Back at my mom's house, we might go play golf.  Do a little golf.  What is today?  Thursday.  Yeah, Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  How's your family, Tom? 
[00:22:30]  They're fine.  Yeah.  I mean, they're all high and dry, air-conditioned shit.  I mean, last night was miserable.  It was just so hot.  You'd just go to sleep, because you'd be so tired and spent.  Yeah.  You'd wake up an hour later just in a puddle of sweat.  You can't even shower to cool off, right?  Yeah, be fit.  No, I'm not even fucking with you.  You know you can't take a shower.  I got no water.  It just sucks.  Oof.  You know, so you got to boil it to drink it.  I'm like, fuck, I wish I just had water. 
[00:23:00]  I'd shower in the fucking anything.  But we'll go hit the pool.  What's up with the mosquitoes?  No, at night they're bad.  And at day they're fine.  Oh, really?  For some reason or another.  They're starting to really talk about the mosquitoes.  Yeah.  It's really, really bad, man.  They say we ain't going to have power now, because New Orleans is really underwater.  And by today, they said everything's going to be even with the lake.  So you're going to be three feet above sea level the water's going to be.  So you look downtown, like the French Quarter, for instance, that's 11 feet below sea level. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  The water fills the French Quarter up to three feet above.  That's 14 feet of water.  Have you been getting any news?  Yeah.  Well, I got DirecTV in the Expedition outside of Park, in the driveway, high and dry.  So, I mean, I can go get some air conditioned for a little bit, but I don't want to burn all my gas and listen to XM.  And watch a little DirecTV, yeah, just fear mongers.  And then the little TV that I got here, you know, it's almost like this was the best one. 
[00:24:00]  I have to be going to love this one.  It's like we're getting reports now in New Orleans East that there are bodies floating in the water,  and boaters, when they come across them, they're tying them up to the poles.  We'll have more details right after this break.  Jesus.  Tying the dead to the poles, huh?  But you had to stay tuned to the break.  Yeah, of course.  Of course you do.  Yeah, they're tying the dead to the poles.  So, you know, we've been down there a few times for the old Mardi Gras thing, like Bourbon Street.  That's what we know.  I mean, how much water is down there? 
[00:24:30]  I haven't seen it.  I mean, I know that, you know, in the CBD, like Canal Street and Poetry Street, right around the dome,  I mean, it's just what I saw on TV.  It's all sand and water.  And the dome, they just got to keep people keep showing up there.  Yeah, well, that's where they're evacuating people there.  It's just, ah.  And now they've told everybody to just get out.  Somehow they've got to get all those people from the Superdome out of New Orleans, which is quite an undertaking.  They're going to put them on cruise ships and, like, those floating hospitals. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Or those floating ships.  Yeah, they are.  What lucky cruise ship gets that detail?  Oh, my God.  Well, they had one of the governors on TV last night.  She didn't know what to do.  They were asking her questions and suggesting stuff, and she's like, yeah, that would be a good idea.  Like, she didn't even know where to begin.  Oh, yeah, the Louisiana governor.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw her.  Blanco.  She really had no clue what to do.  She was not ready for this one.  No.  Not that many people were.  Sugar Ray Nagin, our mayor. 
[00:25:30]  He's, ah.  Yeah, the mayor.  Yeah.  What, ah, I don't understand what, why you haven't made plans past you running out of  food and water.  I haven't made plans just yet past me running out of my ten beers.  I've got to drink them before I get hot.  I mean, I've got plenty of food.  We've got canned goods.  I mean, we'll get, once we eat all the shrimp and steak and hamburgers and fish, I mean, then 
[00:26:00]  we'll just start going to fucking Underwood Deviled Ham.  But they're talking, you know, this could be quite some time before there's anything.  Well, I mean, right.  I'm ready, dude.  You don't think I'm ready to jump in the air-conditioned expedition, watch TV all the way to Baton Rouge,  Lafayette, wherever the fuck I'm going to go, but I can't get out right now.  Have you, ah.  It's miserable.  When I tell you it would look like something like Red Dawn or the day after tomorrow yesterday.  Yeah.  Just walking down Chateau Boulevard.  Saw that movie.  The golf course.  I mean, it's this one tree that I saw that was uprooted. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, this was a huge fucking tree, and it just, it didn't snap it.  It pulled the fucking roots right out of the ground, and I knew where this tree was.  It's like by the seventh hole.  Pulled it right up out of the ground, tossed it about 30 feet down the way.  And I mean, the roots were like 15 feet.  I mean, just the roots.  Yeah, ripped it right out.  It pulled it that far out the ground.  It was just amazing.  You got a gun just in case people come for your food?  Yeah, we saw three, like, Mexican-looking guys.  We had come back from one of the runs we made. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And I closed the door, and I was looking at kind of the big glass part by the front door.  And I called a couple of my boys.  I was like, Mike, Mike, get over here.  And the guy was kind of looking in the house.  I walked out of there, and I was like, dude, dude, can I help you?  He was kind of looking at the neighbor, and then two other friends came walking up.  And I was like, hey, y'all live around here?  Which, obviously, they don't, you know what I mean?  These are, like, big, giant houses.  And the guy goes to me, oh, you don't speak Spanish?  No, habla ingles.  So I'm like, y'all got to get the fuck out of here. 
[00:27:30]  So, yeah, those looters, I know we went to the house.  Habla Mossberg, though, I bet, right?  Right.  The guy was looting the Chevron.  They're like, hey, what's going on?  Oh, nothing.  There's plenty of food and water in there.  You got neighbors around you that stayed?  We saw one set of neighbors, yeah.  That's it, but the whole rest of the neighborhood you're in is deserted, except for you?  It was deserted, and, I mean, the only thing that we saw coming down was the National Guard  in that big truck that gave us a ride for a little while.  Through the water, I mean, it's just so hot. 
[00:28:00]  You just want to take a shower, and I just want air conditioning, man.  Yeah.  Or a Klondike bar, something like that.  I guess you're charging your cell phone in your car?  Yeah, I got, like, four batteries, so, I mean, I still haven't run out of batteries.  But it doesn't really matter.  Nobody's gotten through on their cell phone, and I can't dial out.  Every time I dial out, it's like, call failed, call failed, retry, call failed.  But people can call you.  No, it hadn't, no.  People can text message me.  And you're on a landline right now?  Yes.  Isn't that odd that his phone's working?  The landline's underground.  They're buried underground in this neighborhood. 
[00:28:30]  Oh.  Oh.  So my phone at my house doesn't work, my landline.  Wow.  Well, comparable to other people, I say Tom's doing pretty well.  Yeah, he's one of the...  For somebody that's actually there.  He's one of the real lucky ones.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right, because we went last night.  And it doesn't sound that great.  No, it sounds like it.  It sounds awful.  Well, that would have sucked.  Yeah.  It would have sucked.  Some people were using their shotguns to blow holes in their roofs so they could get on  the roof to survive.  At night, it is so fucking dark. 
[00:29:00]  I mean, I've never seen stars in the city.  One or two, maybe.  Yeah.  And it's so dark.  I mean, you can't even...  If you don't have a flashlight or anything, I mean, you can't see anything.  That's what a lot of people are talking about, how creepy and eerie it is at night because  it's just completely silent and you just kind of sometimes see a glow from one of the  fires going on or, you know, kind of creepy.  I hadn't seen...  I mean, we hadn't seen any fires.  No?  I guess in New Orleans.  I mean, I can see how they start because we had a shitload of candles burning every night. 
[00:29:30]  It's just so hot.  I mean, if it gets any worse, dude, last night was probably the worst.  And I'm sure tonight, thanks for telling me it was Wednesday, you could have at least  said, yeah, it's Thursday.  Oh, yeah.  No.  I don't even know what day it is, dude.  I don't even know what day it is.  It's Wednesday, Tom.  It's light now.  The sun's coming out.  Yeah, it's getting light out.  I guess we're going to get a bunch of new video and reports from New Orleans.  Yeah.  Some of the video yesterday.  They're not even releasing the news.  They're not even releasing, like, how many people are dead and stuff. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I would guess it's probably hard for them to get a line on how many people have  been killed so far because there's not enough communication in place for families to find  out if their family members are okay.  They can't get into a lot of these houses that are up to the roof line with water to  see if there are people in there or they got out.  So I think it's going to be some time before we actually know.  And today's going to be a bad day, dude, because all the water's coming up in New Orleans.  And they say if that whole city is three feet above sea level, like I said, there's not 
[00:30:30]  a place in the city that's five feet below sea level, much less three feet above.  I mean, everything's like eight, nine, 15, 11.  The French border's 11.  They're trying to plug up that levee.  They said they're dropping these giant sandbags.  They're going to be filling up big shipping containers with sand and gravel and dropping  that.  It sounds like they're just dropping huge things and they're trying to get it to stop,  but it's opened up even wider now.  Right.  If it's throwing up shit against the wall, some of it just might stick. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  They're not going to, I mean, you can't stop water, you know that.  But until that stops, they can't pump anything out and it's just getting deeper.  Wow, Tom, you're in some shit.  I know.  Yes, I am, boys.  You smoke, right?  No, not cigarettes.  Oh, not cigarettes.  I was wondering, because once the cigarettes run out, man, god damn, that's got to be rough  for a smoker, especially in a stressful situation.  Oh, my God.  Have your cigarettes run out? 
[00:31:30]  No, just beer.  Beer and a little bit of whatever else.  Yeah.  And the provisions are getting low.  It's like day three.  It's like Survivor, man.  Yeah.  You know, we were walking here, we walked to this guy's house, got to his key from under  his mat.  Just got to go on missions.  And got more, raided his refrigerator, got everything he had, made sure his house was  okay, came, trucked back here, went to my house, got some shit, trucked back here. 
[00:32:00]  Like there's nobody on the streets, a couple of looters.  Wow.  How are the National Guard guys, how do they seem?  Oh, they're cool with, I mean, they, you know, because, I mean, I, you know, we don't need  anything.  I don't really have much, but, you know, I gave them some water.  Yeah.  Any war stories from them about what they've seen so far?  Just a lot of brothers looting.  Yeah.  A lot of looting seems to be the big thing.  You know, they just go hit the store and they take everything.  They come out with a shopping cart full of stuff.  This is what I don't understand, though.  They're taking all the stuff.  Okay.  Where are they taking it to? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Where are you going to put it?  I have no clue.  I have no clue.  Where are you putting your stuff down?  I saw one part on TV.  I don't know if they showed it down on the National League.  They went and they had, it was like a little beat-up Explorer.  They went in the store and they were just taking everything.  And they put it in the back of the Explorer.  In fact, they had so much shit in the Explorer, two of them had the rod on the roof.  And so they see the cameras, they're all hiding their faces.  You know, like they don't want to be on TV.  Yeah, of course not.  Wow.  I don't know where they're taking it to.  I mean, everything's underwater. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  It's not like they could just go and store it anywhere.  They got footage on Fox right now.  A family just on an air mattress on a roadway.  On the side of a highway, yeah.  On the side of a highway that's obviously higher than the water.  Yeah.  There's thousands of people just, that's where they're hanging out.  Thousands of people just kind of sleeping.  They just went up there just to get out of the water.  Amazing.  Camped out.  Did you see the prisoners?  They're about to ride, I heard.  Yeah, they were showing the prisoners.  They had them on an on-ramp to one of the highways.  Their backs to water.  And in front of them was some prison guards with shotguns, just kind of keeping them sitting 
[00:33:30]  there.  But how long could you just leave them sitting before they get a little out of hand, you  know?  Is it pretty imploded?  Totally.  One guy with a shotgun.  Yeah.  Yeah, they got the prisoners out of the jail, out of this particular jail.  They're just sitting there.  And none of the prisoners are moving.  And I was thinking, I said, Dan, probably it's better to be in the prison system at this  point than trying to figure out what the hell's going on on the streets of New Orleans.  Probably so. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, I don't know if the city will ever be the same again.  Yeah, you've been there for a while.  What do you think?  Now they're saying schools aren't going to open again until like December or January.  At least, yeah.  Power won't be there.  Now they're talking about New Orleans.  I mean, power won't be restored just to energy for like six weeks.  And then they've got to start getting it house to house.  I don't see people with any money staying.  You know, I see people with any kind of resources picking up and they don't really have much  left anyway, just picking up and moving away from New Orleans. 
[00:34:30]  And I think impoverished people are going to stay because they've got nothing else to  do and nowhere else to go.  And you're really going to see New Orleans take a downturn.  Well, how old is that levy?  It was built after Hurricane Betsy.  That was in like 65.  Oh, 65, you're right.  68, 69.  Yeah, 69, I'm thinking.  Right around the time that Camille devastated Biloxi, we dodged a bullet there, but on this  one, and this storm was just tremendous. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And I don't know.  I have not much.  There's not much to do here.  No.  I just want to hang out.  I just want to, when the water goes down, I'm out.  Yeah, you're getting out?  Yeah, I don't know where I'm going to go.  Just drive.  What about work for you?  What about work?  We've got the one station that's broadcasting from the fifth floor of the Dominion Tower,  the big talk station in our cluster.  Yeah.  And windows are all blown out.  But you have a job to go back to eventually? 
[00:35:30]  I guess.  Because a lot of people don't.  Oh, I mean, who, you know, what do you, I mean, I guess I could go call on carpet people.  Carpenters, people that are rebuilding.  Yeah, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trades down there going in and getting some work.  There's no commerce right now.  Not for a while, though, yeah.  There's no commerce going on for, what, two, three months, four months, maybe?  It looks like another country.  They're showing these scenes.  It just looks like scenes from Hotel Rwanda. 
[00:36:00]  It's just a mess.  It's amazing.  I'm just walking the streets and looking around.  It's just like, you know, there's just trees everywhere and signs blown down and just like a table in the street.  And just nothing.  Just like you're the only people in the streets and you feel like you're the last people left on earth.  Jim in Brooklyn, he says, did Tom say he wanted to jump in a pool?  You have a pool at the house there?  Yeah.  And the pool's all right?  Yep. 
[00:36:30]  Jeez.  Trust me, if Jim was up here and when it's almost 90 degrees at night, you're trying to sleep.  So what, you're jumping in the pool to try to stay cool?  Go for a swim, play some golf.  Hopefully the water will go down.  All right.  What else is there to do?  Wow.  PSP.  I was playing Tiger Woods golf.  That battery ran out.  Just nothing to do, man.  He's waiting for all his batteries to run out and then he's going to leave.  Well, it's going to start getting testy. 
[00:37:00]  Beer will be gone.  Ice will be gone by a couple hours.  Well, this is going to be interesting because Tom's one of the lucky ones.  I want you to keep reporting to us maybe later today and then tomorrow and Friday.  You know, I think it's going to come down to where you're going to hear Tom is looting.  Tom is going to be in his neighbor's houses finding supplies.  Rifling through their stuff.  I'm not even making a joke.  I'm serious.  I think it's going to deteriorate to that point.  If the water goes down, I'm going to lose my ass out of here. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  You've got to get out.  Just get out.  All I want to do is get to the fucking interstate now.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  Well, good luck to you.  All right.  Hopefully we'll hear from you again.  I'll go walk down the streets.  Maybe I'll give you all a call back.  Y'all are on until 10 o'clock my time.  Yeah.  There you have it.  I'll see what's what.  See if the water went down.  I'll give you a little quick check.  All right.  Cool.  All right, Tom.  All right, boys.  All right.  Be good.  There you go.  Tom from New Orleans.  Good luck, bro.  Our old program director when we were syndicated on commercial radio.  Tom, I let you drink right here in A.M. 
[00:38:00]  Poet.  It's a different sounding Tom, isn't it?  It sure is.  More of a somber sounding Tom.  Exhausted.  All right.  We've got lots to do.  We're going to take a very quick break and we'll continue.  I don't know.  There's just so much to do.  The phones, just a lot of people have comments.  So we'll do a lot of phone calls today.  Stay there.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  How about that woman that says his shirt off?

[00:39:30]  XM202 
[00:40:00]  You're checking out the OPN Anthony program  Kind of a different program today  Everyone's talking about Hurricane Katrina 
[00:40:30]  Ah, I'm back  XM's got a channel 247  Really?  Channel 247  247  It's the emergency channel  Whenever there's some kind of an emergency  Hurricanes, what have you  XM has this fine channel  That has around the clock coverage  247  Where do we want to go next?  I guess the phones  There's a few things going on here 
[00:41:00]  Max in Dallas  Hey, Max, what's going on?  Hey, fellas, how's it going?  All right, man  I just had a question for Professor Anthony  Oh, yes, sir  Earlier you were saying about the oil prices being high and everything  Yeah  I heard the other day the reason why mainly is because we haven't built any refineries in this damn country in like 50 years  And they've cut back on production  Oh, yeah?  It's supposed to be plenty of oil, but we just can't refine it enough quick enough or whatever 
[00:41:30]  How come we were able to refine it when it was at $1.50 a gallon?  Oh, I'm not disagreeing with you  I'm just curious to see if you heard the same thing  No  I haven't heard that one  Is it just me or does it just seem like the majority of the people that are looting are swoothing?  Is what?  Oh, good one, bye  He's making a racist comment  Most of New Orleans is black  Jesus  Have you been down there ever?  Of course  Of course, that's why you see that on the news  There's plenty of white people looting 
[00:42:00]  I've seen that  You know, there's white people down there  They were looting  I was on stage last night at the cellar  I'm doing my nonsense  And I'm talking about something  And there's a couple in the corner kind of chit-chatting  And the show's going well  So I'm like, hey, what's going on?  And they're like, well, we're talking about trying to get the barbecue started  And I'm like, what?  I didn't bite their heads off  I'm like, what are you talking about?  And they're like, well, we're from New Orleans  They happen to be staying in New York  But their three kids were stuck in New Orleans  They were frustrated because they couldn't  They were trying to figure out how to get the kids 
[00:42:30]  So I'm so glad I didn't say anything like a dick move  Yeah  So I talked to them for a minute  And, you know  Whatever  And I said to the guy  Are they in the Superdome?  Like, where are they staying?  And the guy's like  The guy's like, no, we're white  But it was a funny line  I mean, I thought it was very funny  Of course, the stupid crowd got uncomfortable with it  Yeah, of course  If it was a black crowd and a black guy  At a stadium that was shown with white people  That said, no, I'm black  The whole crowd would laugh and clap  Yeah, yeah, yeah  White people are just such fucking douches  So the guy says that 
[00:43:00]  And they're in a tense situation  And, uh, of course  And I finish up the set  And whatever  And then after I come off  The host is Marina Franklin  She's black  Happens to be black  Um, and then some other white customer goes  What was that comment about?  Like, uh  Like when the black host comes back up  Yeah  The paternalistic white person  Has to stick up for the little  The little children  The colored children  Who can't think for themselves  Oh my god  And, uh, Marina actually won 
[00:43:30]  He was kidding  It was a joke  Yeah  He didn't mean anything  And then a couple wind up leaving, I guess  I guess they felt bad  Oh  But just  What fucking  Can people have some fucking empathy?  They do a joke that's a little racially insensitive  And that's what they're worried  Their kids are down in this flooded area  Yeah  Yeah  This idiot is more outraged  At the racially insensitive joke  The guy makes  And it was a good one too, by the way, sir  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey  Mike  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up, Mike?  Hey, Mike  Uh, I don't know if you guys are rolling tape 
[00:44:00]  On CNN Daybreak  But, uh, Chad is still sulking  Uh, at that anchor lady  Really?  What did he do?  Well, this morning  I don't know  He's doing his report  And he said something at the end, you know  And she's interrupting him again  Chad, Chad  And, uh, at the end  She's looking for a reporter  In Mississippi  And she's like  Well, we'll definitely try  And get in touch with him  And he's like  Yeah, I'm sure you will  Oh, really?  Ooh  They're still having a little tiff, huh?  Everyone's on edge  A little snippy  All right, thank you, sir  Why is Chad on edge? 
[00:44:30]  Chad  Chad's the guy from yesterday  Remember this video?  I heard Chad this morning  A little bit of Chad  On my drive-in  I listened to, uh, CNN  On, uh, XM  XM, how great is that?  That's very cool  I'm able to  Because, uh, I usually listen to 1010 Winds  Get the local news  And traffic and stuff  But when a national story happens  Uh, you can go right there  To CNN or Fox News  And, uh, catch some of that  And I was listening  And I heard Chad  Or NPR  Ugh, stop it  The monotone delivery of NPR  Yeah  No noise in the background  No noise 
[00:45:00]  And lots of  Dirt  Pauses  Lots of dirt  From your home country  In the back of your head  And on your satin pillow  As you do your broadcast  Oh, my God  Every cabbie in New York City  Has to listen to NPR  NPR  Yeah  Radio  Unless they're listening to  That  That goddamn music  Whatever it is  Unless they  Colin had the best line ever  I wish it was him delivering  But he says something  You get into a cab  And the guy's listening 
[00:45:30]  To the best of  Clitoral Circumstitions  Speaking of cabbies  You gotta tell the cabbie story  I mean, we're gonna be  All over the ball field today  But, uh  Actually, Anthony made this point  A while ago  I mean, in this city  If you're lucky enough  Quote  To have a white cabbie  Nine out of ten times  He's crazy  They're insane  They're like really crazy people  They're  I don't know  They're  They  They seem like homeless people 
[00:46:00]  That happen to get a hack license  They just have like  They're all  Crazy in that way  Where  You could see them sleeping on the street  But they're  They're white  They're  They're not  Middle Eastern  They're not wearing a turban  But you get in the cab  And go  Wow, it's a white guy  And you expect  Maybe, you know  The old style  Like an episode of Taxi  Maybe  Maybe Rieger  Or something  But you don't get that  You get  Certifiably insane people  I  I  Oh, hi  How are you?  This is the new intern  Ah 
[00:46:30]  Can I have a coffee  Just with a little bit of milk  From the machine here?  Thanks a lot  Very good  Oh, new intern  Alternative young gentleman  So I get in my cab  I leave  I say goodbye to all the people  That work in the building  That love me  Yeah  And I get into a cab  And I have my headphones on  I want to listen to something  And I just  It's a white guy  Wearing a hat  And I just see the movement  Of his fat head  And I'm like  Oh, he's talking  What?  And you got your  Earphones in 
[00:47:00]  I got my earplugs in  I'm looking for Sabbath actually  I'm looking for Sabbath  Of course you are  Want to hear a little hole  In the sky  In the wind  So I take it out  I'm like  Oh, I'm sorry  Sorry, I didn't hear you  Which is  I have my thing in  Which is a hint for  Shut your fat face  Right  You stupid  And he's like  Bet you never saw  A well dressed up cabbie before  Which is correct  Um  I just want to get to where I'm going  In silence  So I'm like  No, no  I think it's good  Dressing up  And I put it back in  And I look up again  And I just see his 
[00:47:30]  Fat mouth continuing  It's like  You know when someone's talking  If you're looking at them  From the back  Right view  You'll just see the subtle  Movements of their head  And you're praying  They have Parkinson's  But you know they don't  They're talking  So I take it out again  I'm like  Sorry, I didn't hear you  He's like  Well, you know  After 9-11  And I traded in my black car  I guess he was a livery driver  Right  For a yellow one  So I realized he's wearing  A chauffeur's uniform  He's driving a yellow cab  In a chauffeur uniform  And he looked exactly like  The doorman from the Jeffersons 
[00:48:00]  That's who he looked like  Stupid  And I'm driving me down Broadway  And he goes  Yeah, I even got a red, white, and blue tie  To commemorate the victims  He holds up his red, white, and blue tie  So I can see it in the back  And he starts talking about  How he's the positive cab driver  And he goes  Whenever you have negativity  Use me like a computer chip  Just double click on my icon mentally  And think of the positivity  Let me take away your negativity  And all I'm thinking of  Is what it would be like  To strangle him 
[00:48:30]  Like they did Johnny Ola  His fucking fat neck  With some piano wire  Just to shut him up  As I'm getting out  His awful tip-begging diatribe  That's what it is  Of course it is  And I get out  And he hands me a thank you card  A card?  It's in an envelope  I was praying to be white powder in it  So I could just fucking eat it  And get this over with  And I really  I know he doesn't have XM  I tried to get him to do a phone-in  Because he's such an ass 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, of course he is  But wherever he is  I hope he has hit a poll  Does he have a pile of these on his seat?  I'm sure he does  Because I just want to thank you  For being a  Do you really?  Insincere?  Fatso?  Why do you have these typed out?  You don't know anything about me  How do you know what our experience  Is going to be like together?  Oh, thank you  Yeah, and this is what it says  I thought it was like  A generic Hallmark card  Or whatever  But I look and I realize  This man  Has typed all this in  Are you surprised  To see a dressed up taxi driver?  That's good  He puts his opening line  In the card 
[00:49:30]  Fucking  He's like a hack  In every way  A hack  And a hack  Hack hack  The taxi commission is looking for me  And I'm dodging him  Shithead  I used to be a limo driver before 9-11  And instead of a slash between 9-11  He has a question mark  Because apparently  Fucking  Tom the doorman  Doesn't proofread  Before he hands his shit out  Ah, gotcha  I traded my black car in for a yellow car  And this is what he told me  I'm not  He hit the shift key, did he?  I have not read this card yet 
[00:50:00]  Honestly, I have not  So if it's redundant  It's because he just repeats  What's on his fucking card  Before 9-11 in February 2001  The bubble burst  On the dot-coms  Then millions of people  Were laid off all over the world  Then all the businesses  Cut their expenses accounts to zero  A ripple effect happened  And all businesses  That supported other businesses  Then laid them off  And some went bust  I hope this guy is dead  Right  Then when the World Trade Center  Got hit  Period  Alan Greenspan  With cranky ass  This is 
[00:50:30]  No, no  This is the sentence  This is the sentence  It goes  Went bust  Period  Then when the World Trade Center  Got hit  Period  Shouldn't that be a comma?  Look, you fucking fatso  In a chauffeur outfit  How about that?  Okay, so that's the whole sentence  That's the whole sentence  Then when the World Trade Center  Got hit  Yes  No, that's the end of the thought  Shit  And then the next sentence  It just put icing on the cake  I hate him 
[00:51:00]  It just put icing on the cake  And he capitalizes icing and cake  Well, wouldn't you?  Of course I would  They're both proper names  Mr. Icing Cake  That's right  Mr. Icing and Mrs. Cake  Would like to say  Duh, you fat pig  It just put the icing on the cake  Comma  And it'd blow everything out of the ballpark for everybody  Yes, it does blow everything out of the ballpark for everybody  What?  Wow  So I'm still chauffeuring people around  Why shouldn't I dress appropriately, positively, and professionally?  No question mark, of course 
[00:51:30]  You might as well put that instead of a slash in between 9 and 11  You fucking blubber  That's where you're supposed to use that question  Of course  And he capitalizes and darkens appropriately, positively, and professionally  In the next sentence  Because I want you to leave my car more positive than you came in and have a more positive day  Said Robert Reed  And then in parentheses  I'm positive you're an ass  He really is  I want you to leave my car more positive than you came in and have a more positive day  And then in parentheses 
[00:52:00]  Weekend, comma, flight, comma, stay in New York, comma, etc  Oh, like if you're here for the weekend  Like he's giving different reasons you might have been in his car  Been in his car  It's the weekend, you have a flight to catch  Right  He's just trying to be pertinent and relevant  Anytime you have any negativity, capitalized and darkened  Picture me as a computer icon in your mind  This fucking asshole is just putting a thank you card  What he babbled about the whole time 
[00:52:30]  What he babbled during the ride  As the only taxi driver wearing a chauffeur uniform  And an American flag tie in parentheses since 9-11  What?  What'd you wear before that?  A red one with a white circle in the middle of it?  You fucking Jap lover?  And listen to classical music  Everything is positive and relaxing  Yeah  I wonder if he gives himself these affirmations in the mirror  I am not a fat pig in a yellow cab  I make people happy  You make no one happy  You know how people are happy? 
[00:53:00]  Thank God I'm not that horse's ass  Alright  Everything is positive  Ever since 9-11  And listen to classical music  Everything is positive and relaxing  So anytime you have any negativity  You pull up my icon and double click it  And let my positivity flow out  So to rid of the negativity  Out  So to get rid of the negativity getting in  Use me as a catalyst to get started  Wow  I wish he was here

[01:10:30]  Canal Street's dry  The French Quarter's dry  I was waiting for one of the reporters  To say  Excuse me  But have you been listening  To our coverage?  Yeah they love  They love extending disasters  Is what the news does  So even though they're not adding  Any new features really  Any new fear features  They love making it sound like  It's going to last forever  And they don't love  When the disaster ends  Like the second the water  Starts receding  And going down  They won't want to report that  They'll be like  Well reports that 
[01:11:00]  Part of the levy is weakening  Right right  And it could burst  Causing the whole area to reflood  Like they don't like saying  Well it's getting better  I just saw a video on the news  I gotta step in here  The guy on the roof  Pointing at the fire  Yeah  The fire is out  It's been out for hours  Maybe close to a day now  But they still show the footage  Of the guy on his roof  Pointing at the fire  The Carlos Mencia looking guy  Right  Yeah  So until they get  Other outrageous footage  They're going to keep showing 
[01:11:30]  The stuff they already have  Like it's happening now  Right  Yeah because they don't  Yeah  Yeah  The average viewer is looking up  Going oh my god  Look at that poor guy on his roof  You know pointing at the fire  Well that  That has passed  That one incident  Right  Yes sir  They'll continue showing that  All day long  One of the biggest things  I've got a lot of friends  Who work on refining  And what not  And they said  That is one of the biggest issues  Right now  Is refining capacity  Is down  And one of the local  Talk show hosts  Here in Denver 
[01:12:00]  Yesterday  Was commenting  That the oil and gas  Industry  Is bringing  The oil industry  Is bringing in  More crude  Than they're refining  Oh yeah  It's a variation  Of something like  600,000 barrels  A day  Well then why don't we  Get refineries cranking  That would be  More jobs  Because the fucking  Environmentalists  Won't let us build one  There you go  There you go  They've been trying to build  Five refineries in Arizona  For three years  And the environmental lobby 
[01:12:30]  Has it tied up in court  You know what dude  I'll say the environmental lobby  Is irritating  But the big oil companies  Have really  There's so many other  Alternative ways  To do this  That they're  I don't think there are  I think so  At the point we're at  In history right here  Maybe in the future  Someday we'll have  Matter, antimatter  Generators  Like in Star Trek  But right now  It's all about the Earl  I'm all for the windmills  Windmills huh

The whole front of the thing  You've got to get in this car  It's half that  My energy meter  Yeah half those meters  Are bullshit  They're just there  Spinning and lighting up  For no real reason  Well it tells you  When the engine is shut off  Basically  When the gasoline engine  Has shut down  And you're running on 
[01:18:00]  Battery power  When you're running on  Battery power  Because as it's moving  And as you're braking  It's charging the  The hybrid  Thank you Jimmy  I speak with my hand  When Steve talks  I just interrupted you  You see Steve is moving  His left arm  And like  It looks like he's  Holding a softball  That doesn't exist  That's how his hand is cleansed  Like a Roman emperor  He's presenting something  To the people  Presenting  And it's just  Well spoken dreck  Or shit  The rest of the  Or shit  Where are your batteries  Stored  In the trunk  In the trunk 
[01:18:30]  Well not in the trunk  It's in that area  Below the trunk  Yeah below the trunk  Where a gas tank would be  Yeah I mean half of it  Half of it is like  Maybe a 10 or 11 gallon gas tank  Any problems  How far are batteries  Can you go  Say you run out of gas  How far can you go on your battery  I've had it down to zero once  And I went about  Maybe 20 miles I think  And you're on no gas  On no gas  I mean but you have to drive  Pretty slow  You've got to drive about  30 miles an hour  When you do that  Why did you run out of gas  Because I wasn't paying attention  What could you  With all those gauges  It was brand new  It was brand new 
[01:19:00]  And I thought  Ah shit  Let's see what this thing can do  And I was on  I know what happened  What happened  You went to get gas  And when you got out  They thought you were threatening  They didn't realize  You were just standing up  To look around  I seem to have run out of petrol  Tigger could you pump some gas  Into this please  Or something  Or something that sounds like that  To the attendant  Wow  But you're right  You don't see that many SUVs  On the road 
[01:19:30]  You just don't  No  You won't  And what about those people  That have to drive in from  You know western New Jersey  Or eastern Long Island  Maine  Exactly  Commute from Maine  But that's the way to go man  He's got  He's getting like  60 miles to a gallon  Or 40 miles  Or 50 miles to a gallon  My point was that  There are ways  To do it  To cut down  A lot  A lot  They could do it full  Electric if they wanted to  They could  They absolutely could  I mean  But don't we live in a country  Where if we want to drive  An apartment building on wheels  We should be able to 
[01:20:00]  If you can afford it  Absolutely  I mean why not  This is  America  And if we want to drive  These huge gas sucking SUVs  We should be able to  We shouldn't even have to worry about it  We shouldn't have to be rich  And fancy  We should be able to just be  The average Joe  That goes to work  And earns a good wage  Every day  He should still be able to buy  That big vehicle  Because we're Americans  We shouldn't have to be like 
[01:20:30]  A big cuddly bear  And buy a roller skate  With a diesel battery in it  To get to work  You  A hybrid  What?  It says pussy car  It's a pussy mobile  It certainly does not  There is nothing sexy  Nothing strong  Nothing  People  Heads aren't going to turn  And why  How come there's  Year long waiting lists  For these things  Are there that many pussies  That want hybrids?  Yes  Only one company  Is dumb enough to make them  Right  It's a hybrid 
[01:21:00]  It's part vehicle  Part carnivore  I'm spending a lot less  On gas  Yeah  I got my hybrid  It's a chick magnet  Well look dude  Lexus is making  A hybrid Lexus  SUV that's coming out  That's actually  I think it's out right now  Really?  The Highlander is an SUV  Hummer is making  A hybrid  Which I don't understand  Because it's going to  Maybe 14 miles  What make is yours?  Toyota  I'm sorry 
[01:21:30]  I'm sorry to interrupt you  Speaking of hybrids  Did they take that magazine  Because I want a picture  Hung up  I saw a hybrid  All right  I like Steve  For doing that  I respect the fact  That you're saving some money  Let's say hi to Tim  In St. Louis  Tim what's going on buddy?  What's going on  Hey man  Tim  Tim you're on  Go ahead Tim  Yeah  That's nothing  I just wanted to say  It took like  I filled up my tank  Yesterday  On my big truck  And it was like  Almost $700  $700 
[01:22:00]  $700  What do you drive  Like a tanker truck  Do you have to fill  The actual rig  The back  No it's a  2001 Freightliner  It's got 150 gallon  Tanks on each side  Wow  Oh 300 gallons  700  How many miles  Do you go on that?  I'm on my way  To Spartanburg  South Carolina  Right now  From St. Louis  I mean  How many miles  Can you go on  A full tank?  About 1200  1200  That's it?  That's a lot  Of miles  That's a lot  For $700 
[01:22:30]  That's pretty good  1200  How much a gallon  Sir?  I don't feel like  Doing the math  I was in Nevada  About two weeks ago  And I paid  $2.79 a gallon  That's high  They're saying in Jersey  It's up to $3  In some places already  Alright Tim  Thank you  Well we're going to get  A lot of these calls  John in Oklahoma  $640 to fill up his tank  Right John?  Yeah  What do you drive  A Honda?  No  No  Freightliner  Alright  Well obviously  It's out of control 
[01:23:00]  The fuel cost  Tell B-Power Steve  That all the money  He's saving on gas  Will be spent  Replacing that $500  Battery in about  Three years  Also that big old  Acid filled battery  Causes more damage  To the environment  Than gas  No it doesn't  No it doesn't  You don't have  It's not vented  Right?  Not vented batteries  No  The old style batteries  Used to leak  Yeah  It's totally self-contained  And there's  Seven tons of them  Have they told you  About battery life  And how long  Those things  Are supposed to last  I'm sure  I'm sure it's  In the documentation  Somewhere  It ain't just like  Going to Sears 
[01:23:30]  And buying one of  Those batteries  And popping it  Under your hood  Well no that's the thing  It does regenerate power  It doesn't  You know the  The combustion engine  Powers the fuel cell  While you're driving  So as far as  How long that lasts  I don't know  I can look it up though  Yeah  And the guy who just  Wrote that  He's like one of those guys  He's just saying  He just says shit  Bloom and doom guy  Dude that acid  Causes more problems  Than gas  And people go  Really yeah  He's the guy  That when he's talking  About counterfeiting money  He's like dude  The government's  The ones counterfeiting  Yeah  Where's your facts  None  Dude they are  Don't have one  There's a website  Let's say how to 
[01:24:00]  Carl in Texas  Carl what do you got  For the program  Hey what's going on guys  Hey Carl  Hi Carl  Yeah  Yeah when I was in college  We actually built  A couple of hybrids  For the department of energy  One that was gas electric  Like what she's got  And one that's  A hydrogen  Full hybrid  And to be honest  Yeah those gas electrics  Are great  But you know  The mileage on them  Is still a problem  You're still using gas  And it's a start  But the reality is  The way it looks like  It's going  And BMW's already  Produced one  And Honda's already 
[01:24:30]  Made one  And GM's making them  It's these hydrogen  Powered vehicles  He's right  He's right  But you have to put  Hydrogen refueling stations  On the highways  And it's going to be a while  The hybrid car  Is a nice transition piece  Where do you find one  There was a good  Hydrogen powered  Mode of transportation  A few years ago  It was called  The Hindenburg  That thing worked out well  Oh my god  The humanity  Oh  You guys are talking about  Oh get out of the way  The purpose of the vehicle  Was to actually produce it 
[01:25:00]  To make it  Exactly like  A 2000  Suburban  And it had the same functionality  Same acceleration  Same haul  Everything  So you didn't lose anything  So to the driver  It was exactly the same vehicle  It just you fill up  With a different place  That's all  All right  Thank you Carl  Yeah  Take it  Chuck from Pittsburgh  Saying sorry  The increase in my weekly gas  Cost from $1.60  A gallon to $2.60  A gallon is about $22  The cost of walking away  From an accident  Priceless  There you go  I like some steel around me  My friend 
[01:25:30]  How about that  What happens when  Your car gets rear ended  And you get  Battery acid all over  Well that is the one drawback  Yeah that is a drawback  The whole fucking car  Is a crumple zone  It's a huge like  Crumple zone  Of just tin foil  And battery acid  Is what you drive around in  Yeah it's a very light car  Hopefully  And if you read about hybrids  You realize that the  The progression would be  To build these things  Out of lighter  Stronger metals  Of course  So that you know  You could build a smaller car  That wouldn't weigh so much  Composites  Space age polymers 
[01:26:00]  Exactly  But that's where it's going  Oh there goes Steve  Steve is driving around  In the studio  And it is a hybrid  Here comes Steve  To work  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Cool  Look out  Look here he comes  Oh Steve  He's showing off now  Jesus  There's a bear  Driving the hybrid  Clumsy claws  Are trying to hit the buttons  Are fumbling 
[01:26:30]  Steve  Careful  Oh  It doesn't make sense  That you're the one  With the hybrid  You should be driving  The Hummer  Oh you need the big vehicle  I used to have an SUV  You must be hysterical  Squeezing into that thing  No it's not  It's surprisingly roomy  On the inside  Oak's been inside  It's  Yeah  There's actually a lot  Of room on the inside  It's a weird angle though  What do you mean angle  I don't  I can't even explain it  Like the windshield  And it goes up like  Does he have one of those  Huge dashboards  Yeah  Yeah  Like because the windshield 
[01:27:00]  Has to be at such an extreme angle  To cut down on wind resistance  Yeah  It's a weird  Weird angle  So you're looking out the front  You know  Through the windshield  But because of the angle  It's just a strange view  Yeah  The windshield is huge  It's shaped like a big wedge  To cut down on  Right  On the wind resistance  It's like a big cheese wedge  Shape  Oh my goodness  It's really strange  You can't put anything  On your dashboard  Because it starts off  Really really  You know  Tiny  And it gets bigger  Alright  Hop in it again Steve  Take another laugh around  Hey 
[01:27:30]  Hey  Hey  Can I get  The hybrid  See him on the side of the highway  Broken down with an electrical cord  Looking for a place to plug it in  You don't have to plug it in though  Of course you don't  Alright let's say hi to Gonzo  In Long Island  Gonzo  Yeah  What's up Gonzo  Not much man  How you guys doing  Alright  Go ahead Gonzo  Oh alright  Listen  On defense of Steve man  I got a hybrid  I got a  Toyota Highlander 
[01:28:00]  And that thing boogies man  It puts a 260 horsepower  You can fly on the highway  Oh yeah  It's a Highlander  You know  It does good  The gas mileage  I just took a trip  Up to the Cascales  And on the gas tank  It was what  I got 20  Almost 28 miles per gallon  On the last SUV  Alright well there you go  Thank you sir  Hey  See ya  Bye  Alright  Anthony we got more  Hurricane Katrina coverage here  Fox News 
[01:28:30]  Talked to a homeboy  This is what  One of our  Crack staff  Wrote down  Homeboy talks about  Anarchy in New Orleans  Anarchy  Nice  Joining me now live  Is a man  Aaron Age  You are 22 years old  You have walked  You spent the night  Here on the concrete  Right  How frustrated is  Everyone  I understand there were  Fights overnight  Well yeah  It's a lot of fights  There's a lot of  Looting going on  There's a lot of  You know  Staling or whatever  People fighting  Or whatever  A lot of people  You know  Emotions are running high  You know  Our male 
[01:29:00]  Rene  Has to have a plan  On you know  This kind of  Police needs incidents  Or whatever  But he doesn't  Would you say  There's anarchy  In the city  At this point  It's vellum out there  There's a lot of  People that's going crazy  You know  I want to say  To the people  All across this country  Look how we live in  New Orleans  Is a place  It's called  The Big East  It's a place  Of fun  And having good times  Or whatever  And we have people  That's looting  And acting crazy  Because we're confused  Right now  We don't know  What's going on  And our men's  Not telling us  We're just not  Getting any feedback  Is this one of those  Situations where 
[01:29:30]  It's a desperate  Situation and people  Are taking desperate  Means to survive  Right  Like you say  You take desperate  Mets for desperate  Situations or whatever  And people are doing  Whatever  Staling to looting  To robbing people  You know  One girl got raped  Last night  It's crazy  And I want all kind  Of women to know  Across the country  This is what kind  Of stuff happens  To you  At hurricanes  If you don't take  The right kind  Of provisions  To avoid this  We certainly have  A lot of problems  To fix here  And city leaders  Hopefully we'll resolve  Your plight  As well as that  Of everyone else  Below us 
[01:30:00]  There you go  Some of the latest audio  People get raped  That's what happens  In hurricanes  That hole in the levee  Is getting wider  Seems to be getting wider  Huh  It certainly does  That's the big breach  You can see the water  It looks like the water  Is almost even  In height though  Is that a big drop off  Yeah I think  That's a drop off  Right there  Yeah  Wow man  Unbelievable  Yikes  Jim  So go ahead  Well that particular  Stretch of levee  That's the same  Why don't we only get  In one year  That is one of two 
[01:30:30]  Large breaches  That initially developed  The day  It's only in one year  It's only in one year  Sorry  Oh oh  We got a room  The room is speaking  What happened  Do what  Sometimes you have to  Flip it back and forth  Real quick  It shorts out  Alright  Is that what it is  Let's try that  Monday night  Wow  This wasn't the big one  That everyone feared  We got off easy  Once again  We narrowly averted  A catastrophe once again 
[01:31:00]  But then  The next day  All of that water  All of that  Tidal rise  That  Into Lake  Train  Saturated that section  Of levee  So much so  That it finally fell apart  In two spots  That 17th street section  As well as  At another section  However  The other section  Is now flowing properly  It's not leading  More water into the city  However  As we all know  All night long  More and more water  Has been spreading  Block after block  Rising higher and higher 
[01:31:30]  Into the city  And at 10pm last night  In a very somber  News conference  In Baton Rouge  State leaders  Predicted that  By about right now  The city of New Orleans  Everywhere would be  Under nine feet  Of water  It does not appear  To be  That is the case  Certainly not nine feet  Deep around the superdome  However it is  A crisis  On this elevated bridge  As you can see  This materialized  Overnight in the dark  When we got here  We got up to this  Overpass that we're on  It was one of the most  Eerie scenes 
[01:32:00]  I have ever seen  In my life  You peer over the edge  And you look down  And all of these people  Were sleeping  In fact there were  Even more people  Here last night  It was body to body  Little kids  Sleeping together  Elderly men and women  Sleeping adjacent  To each other  And people talking  You could barely tell  They were humans  It was so dark  Remember it's a blackout  There's no power  In New Orleans  No electricity  Well this is how  Desperate the situation  Has gotten  These are residents 
[01:32:30]  Who had to evacuate  Their neighborhoods  On the day after  The hurricane  When they thought  They had escaped tragedy  Well certainly  Twenty hours later  Next thing you knew  Water rising  Into their front door  Into the windows  Up to the ceiling  And so they have all  Walked here from miles around  And here is where  They were on concrete  An elevated overpass  Hoping some National Guard  Trucks like the ones  We're seeing right there  Will bring them 
[01:33:00]  Into the Superdome  You can't walk  Into the Superdome  Right now  It's surrounded  By four to five feet  Deep water  It's a moat  Around the Superdome  And there's about  Fifteen thousand people  Now inside the Superdome  The helipad  You might be able  To make out  Here on the edge  Of the Superdome  Two Black Hawk helicopters  With the Louisiana  National Guard  This is where they land  And drop off people  They have rescued  Off of rooftops  And in surrounding  Flooded areas  That number is now  At three thousand  But as we speak 
[01:33:30]  The search and rescue  Operation now  In high gear  Back to you in New York  Alright Phil  Oh my god  There's your update  What are they gonna do  Oh my god  Nothing  I didn't realize  People still want  To get in the Superdome  They're trying to get  Everybody out of it  And now people still  Have nowhere to go  Well they don't know  Where to take the people  That are already inside  And then there's more people  That want to get inside  Because it's better  Than living on an overpass  How many people  Can you fit on a cruise ship  Because they weren't  Talking about doing that  A couple thousand  A couple thousand  Yeah  A few thousand  Yeah  How many cruise ships  Can you possibly get 
[01:34:00]  In that area  You'd have to find a way  To get people out  Put them on trucks  Or whatever  That's the hard part  Is getting them out  How about Royal Caribbean  And all these other  They should each donate  A ship for a month  Or whatever  That's a lot but  You're insane  Why not?  Because I'm taking a cruise  In the spring  And I don't want  My room must with  Not the one you're on  I'm a fancy person  And I need a fancy room  Will people be fighting  Over the suites  Graffiti on the walls  Of my room  I'm sure that wouldn't happen 
[01:34:30]  Let's go to Gene  In Florida  Gene  Yeah what's up there  Hey Gene  Yeah I just wanted  To comment  When the waters  Start receding  You were talking  About the media  You know  Not having anything  To go on  Then they'll be  On to the bodies  Now we're going to  Go ahead and recover  The bodies  That'll be the next  Yeah they always  Go in those waves  Right now it's all  About the flooding  And then afterwards  It'll be about  The body recoveries  Exactly  And rebuilding  Exactly  More than 100 reported 
[01:35:00]  Dead in Mississippi  That number is so low  It's not even funny  Oh  That's all they're  Reporting right now  100 people  Hey Gene  It's going to be  Astronomical  Go ahead  Were you in a  Just because you have  A name that goes for  Boy and a girl  Were you in an area  Of Florida got hit  Or no  I was in Fort Pierce  Yep  Two or two times  Last year  Or three times  I'm in with this storm  Though  No  Okay  No we did  The one this year  But last year  Didn't even compare 
[01:35:30]  To what they're  Going through  You know  What we had last year  It was not even close  I felt bad  For my sister  She lost her roof  Last year  In one of the hurricanes  In Florida  Down here  Yeah  Yeah that's nothing  I mean you guys  Got hit with what  Five in a row  Or something  In the Orlando area  If they get any weather  Down there now  It's just going to be  A problem  A bigger problem  It'll be  Tuna can Charlie  What's up  How you doing guys  Hey  Happy birthday bird  Vagina lips  Thank you TC  Hey I'm 
[01:36:00]  I'm up in New Hampshire  And I got pissed off  Yesterday when I drove  Past my gas station  And the price of gas  Went up by 70 cents  Like  Yeah  Overnight 70 cents  Overnight  Wow  Like the gas  In their tank  Is suddenly more expensive  Like  They're laughing  They are laughing  At us  By the way  I heard  Just on the same vein  I heard  Someone instant feedback  To me  Or instant message  To me last night  That there was  Some hotel in Texas  Or a motel  A comfort inn  Again I don't know  This is true  That went from  $99 to $199 
[01:36:30]  They were price gouging  Because these poor people  Are running out of  Bastards  If that's the truth  I would love to know  What their address is  I would love to give them  A good plug on the air  And people could look it up  And call that  Comfort Inn  Make reservations  What scumbags  Jack your price  They didn't want to say  Their skinnies on the roof  Their skinnies on the roof  Yeah the Blackhawks  Coming in to rescue people  Alright let's say  John what's up  Hey what's up guys  Hey  I was just wondering 
[01:37:00]  When they were going to  Get to the important issues  Like whether or not  The New Orleans Saints  Are going to be able to  Go play in their stadium  Or what  Probably not this year  They're probably  To be displaced  They're designing helmets  With clothespins  On the face masks  So they can  No  Got a stink in there right  Awesome  Gene Ann it looks like  From Minnesota  After that joke  We should have our  Headphones designed that way  Gene Ann what's up 
[01:37:30]  We're just talking about  The pollution that's going on  In New Orleans  With the stealing of the shoes  Yeah they're stealing shoes  In New Orleans  Shoes  The footlocker down there  Got destroyed  They took all my shoes  And my glasses  Yeah  You think they'd take water  And food  Well they are  They're taking everything  They're saying on the news now  That they cannot control  The looting in the area  They just have pretty much  Given up on that point  What'd you say  They need to take what  I didn't hear you  Water and food 
[01:38:00]  Instead of shoes  No they gotta take food  But  It's a lot of  A lot of places  Don't have food  Or at least hip waiters  Hip waiters  Hip waiters  Yeah  Well they only work  In certain clubs  Yeah I was going over  Your numbers  And they're pretty sweet  Alright  Over my numbers  Where are you from  Minnesota  Okay I thought so  Alright  Bye  Take care  Would you like some food  That is a dopey ass accent 
[01:38:30]  That's horrendous  I would rather not eat  Than hear that  Do you want some food  Shut up  No  You ruined my appetite  Again  Congratulations  Two weeks running  Gonna take another angle here  What Opie  The experts have hit the TV  The experts have hit  The TV  Every disaster needs an expert  Of course  They parade them out  To help us through  The feelings we're feeling  The know-it-alls  So here's a psychologist  Oh this is  Taking that angle  With that expert  Because I've seen experts 
[01:39:00]  All day on engineering  And disasters  And first aid  Well those you can understand  But this is now  A psychiatrist  I would love  It would be interesting  If one of these  News organizations  Interviewed someone  To just explain  How they even begin  To rebuild  How do you clear out  This devastation  Where do you start  Where do you start  You got the truck  You got the crane  What do you pick up first  The dead fish  And dead animals  That are going to be  I mean do you understand  The rot  Everywhere  That's going to be  The smell  I mean that's  It's not like it's 
[01:39:30]  At least in October  November  I mean it's August  That's just amazing  Well Georgia  The psychologist  Was on the news  This morning  The devastation caused  By Hurricane Katrina  Has the whole nation  Reeling this morning  With us to talk about  A best-selling author  Psychologist  And Fox News contributor  Dr. Georgia Witkin  The author of Stress Relief  For Disasters  Great and Small  And certainly  This would qualify  As great  In fact  Some are saying  This could be  The worst national disaster  We've dealt with  Yeah  You know  And when you see  The range of emotions 
[01:40:00]  The survivors must go through  You know  It seems unbelievable  A lot of them feel  Thrilled that they  Were able to make it through  And now they're looking  Ahead to a future  Where everything  They've known is gone  Yeah  I mean we say  How could they possibly survive  Were kind of built  For disasters  That's part of what  We've dealt with  For millions of years  But what happens  While they're in the midst  Of it like now  Is really a kind  Of emotional shock  You're an automatic pilot  You're saving your own life  You're not feeling pain  Literally  A numbness  That protects you 
[01:40:30]  And helps you move  The hardest part  Literally a numbness  She uh  I tell you one thing  She's insightful  What an ass  And we've been dealing  With disasters  For millions of years  Excuse me  I think an early man  Has been around  For uh  You know  Eh maybe a million  Right  A million  I figure in  The missing links too  Yeah  I don't think they're worried  About the disasters  Back then  They weren't building  Levees either  No  They were just running around  Trying to make fire  Natural disaster was good 
[01:41:00]  Stupid  Because it burned things  And they would keep the fire  It's warm  Wow  But I want to hear more  Because I'm not sure  Because so far  I've learned a lot  Psycho bevel  That people are trying  To save their own lives  Which is interesting  Because I thought  People just kind of  Stood there like cows  On fire  Waiting  She's good  They've got to get rid  Of the experts on TV  They add nothing  To the discussion  Unless like you said  It's a physical expert  On how to build something  Or an engineer  Yeah exactly  Move  The hardest part  Is what happens 
[01:41:30]  Right after  Oh really  Once you've been rescued  And your life  Is devastated  Sure  That is absolutely  The hardest part  What happens  Is number one  You're overwhelmed  By what lies  In front of you  This  See this is why  I like her  Because  Do you understand  Until she said that  I always thought  The hardest part  Was two weeks prior  But apparently  It's right after  Right after  A disaster  Strikes  Things are hard  And then you're  Overwhelmed 
[01:42:00]  When you realize  Because I  I remember a friend  And I were talking  And he said  What do you think  Happens when everything  In your life  Is taken away  And I said  You probably don't  Feel much  No  And according to her  You're overwhelmed  Overwhelmed  I stand correct  I thought you'd go  Search out a carnival  I'm going to the fair  Right  Is there a street fair  That I could go to  You're overwhelmed  Okay  No homes  No community  Etc  Number two  There's no routine  To give you  Any stabilization 
[01:42:30]  To help you  To predict  What's coming next  So your body  Still feels like  There's an emergency  And fight and flight  The adrenaline is pouring  And there's nothing  You can do with it  Right now  Except perhaps  Be in a shelter  Number three  There is exhaustion  You've saved yourself  You've gotten out of danger  You've gathered your family  Hopefully everybody's safe  But there's really  Such exhaustion  And yet  Your brain is still on alert  And your body's still on alert  And survivor's guilt  You've heard it  What that means is 
[01:43:00]  As you said  Are you looking for this one Anthony?  Well  No shit  Right  I saw you looking for it  I'm like  I'll save you the time  I know  That's exactly the one  I was looking for  Well  No shit Sherlock  Wow  Jesus  I don't know  But she was saying  Number three  Has anyone learned anything yet?  I was still looking for one and two  I haven't heard one and two yet  And she's looking for number three  Yeah  I backed up a little bit  Number three  She says you get a little sleepy  You feel lucky to be alive  Yeah  On the other hand  Too guilty about those that have been lost 
[01:43:30]  To relieve any kind of enjoyment  But can you just stop  Can you rewind at this dog shit reporter in the background  Who went  Like the exasperated commiserating sigh  The guilt of the  Listen to this phony  As you said Steve  You feel lucky to be alive  Yeah  On the other hand  Too guilty about those that have been lost  To relieve any kind of enjoyment  Oh shit  Oh  The loss  Yeah  That's such a  Compassionate reporter  Yeah  The loss  Remember  Where's my coffee 
[01:44:00]  Where's my coffee  Great loss  Great loss  Great loss  If any kind of enjoyment  And that's for years  Everything I'm saying goes on for years  Because the brain keeps reviewing the images you've seen  To try to help you digest it  Sure  Which also means it's disrupting sleep  And last but not least  Uh oh  Last but not least  Last but not least  Hopefully it wouldn't be least  Because in this little grouping least  Is really insignificant  And I hope everybody's listening very carefully to this 
[01:44:30]  Are we all listening very carefully  Hey in there  Wake up  Wake up  Wake up in there  Headphones on  She said carefully  We're all going to listen carefully  Listen everybody  She's an expert god damn it  And I hope everybody's listening very carefully to this  Very soon the nation will move on  There may be money allotted  But the huge outpouring now  And the presence of all of the supporters  Okay  I listened very carefully 
[01:45:00]  Very money the soon shall move on  She didn't say that did she  I wasn't listening that correctly  She might as well have  I was  Wait can you play that  I was so nervous I heard it wrong  I don't understand  Very money the soon shall nation  Oh  I tried listening carefully  I couldn't do it  There's so much pressure to listen carefully  Ben is trying to listen carefully  But the poor little fella can't get the headphones  Over that Easter Island skull of his  Just take two separate headsets  And hold one from each on their  Old Biloxi hair  Ben is wondering why he's walking to work 
[01:45:30]  In this National Guard helicopter  Circling his head  Oh was he not helpful this morning  Alright listen we're trying to  We want to get some people from New Orleans  On the phone 
[01:46:00]  Yeah Tom's probably really hot  Alright good  Hey Jim what's that called here  Tom's that dude  What an ass  He really is retarded  You know how awful he'd be in a crisis like this  Trying to find a dry surface to dump white powder onto  He's got flying mirrors and razor blades 
[01:46:30]  Help me out  Oh my god  Wow  Alright I backed it up  Because we've got to listen closely again  I hope everybody's listening very carefully to this  Very soon  The nation will move on  There may be money allotted  But the huge outpouring now  And the presence of all of the support systems  Will be gone  There'll be other disasters  The nation will move on 
[01:47:00]  And these people will still be repairing  For years  And they'll be doing it  As they feel  Alone  Yeah she does make a good point  Because  She does  In a way  Because Fox, CNN  They're all covering it  Like it's the biggest thing  And they're  They're showing that they're caring  And really concerned with what's going on down there  If news breaks on the wire  That we caught Osama bin Laden  This whole thing goes away  Immediately  Yeah  Absolutely immediately 
[01:47:30]  Showing that in the end  They don't give a flying fuck  No  I feel bad for people  It's like  It just sucks to lose everything  All your shit  Your personal irreplaceable  Ugh  Fuck man  That is a  Huge  Your trophies  Your phone  Whatever it is  That you keep  You're not just  All your personal items  The reality is  That we all have just junk  No I know  But there's some stuff  Do you really have anything  That matters that much  Just shit that says  Hey  I'm here  Yeah  And I was here 
[01:48:00]  I've existed  Stuff I fight the urge to throw away  That stuff  Even your photos  No  No one looks at their photos  You need your photos  I do Opie  You never go through  You go through your photo albums  I love  You never go through  At family functions  And go  Oh please  Look remember  Maybe  Maybe once a year tops  Maybe  Yeah that's what they're there for  Maybe  I look at my photos  You think I don't want to see my picture  With 50 Cent  Or any of these other celebrities  Very important to you  That would devastate you 
[01:48:30]  Lloyd Banks maybe  Some other G-Unit members  Your collection of celebrity photographs  I actually have to put that on a server  Somebody is aspiring to do it  Let's get back to the experts  Somebody  You know  This is very important  This is what a self-centered ass I am  We're talking about a disaster in New Orleans  And I've somehow turned it into  I have to save my celebrity photos  Right  I'm a fool and an ass  Hey Paul Anka  Hmm  Paul Anka's on ABC  The residents get relief  There's that band he pitched at 
[01:49:00]  Just want to live  While I'm alive  What a ham  It's my life  Alright he's pretty good  He sounds really good  Damn  You gotta give it to him  That band better play good  Alright  I'm holding up my part of the bargain  He was belted out of tune 
[01:49:30]  He was  Old school  Talking about being alive  That's a good choice of music today  Alone  Right  He doesn't care  And you know I'm sure  Just like that man right there  Waving the towel  Or waving the shirt  He feels alone  When's one of those helicopters  Going to pick me up  For the people who are still inside  Of course  Who did not get out  It's almost as if they're trapped  Because they don't have  That you know there is no food inside  That's right  And so then when you hear a story  About the looting 
[01:50:00]  Where people have broken into the Winn-Dixie  And they're ransacking the store  Or you see these people  You know there are a lot of stories  And a lot of pictures  Of people walking off  With Rolexes and shoes  And groceries  And everything else  But at this  There's just  You know  At some point  You suddenly  I'm sure those people are saying  Look I'm not stealing  I'm surviving  That's very interesting  I think some of them really know  Very clearly they're stealing  Yeah  But this is what happens  In situations where you lose structure 
[01:50:30]  Yeah  You know  This is part of human history  When the structure is gone  And the routine is gone  And the police are busy  There's a feeling  Of that you are anonymous  It's almost as if  People feel like  No one's going to see them  Everyone's busy doing their own thing  Look at these pictures  I'm sure there's a lot of people  Also that feel like  No one's going to help them  But themselves at this point  Because there seems to be  No capacity  You know  Right now  To help everyone  And I think what we're going to find  Is that there are going to be stories  Of how people helped each other 
[01:51:00]  Oh shut up  That's going to be  Touching and breathtaking  Absolutely  Yeah  Dr. Georgia Wicken  Thank you very much  For joining us this morning  How about this  Dr. Georgia  Thanks for nothing  Thanks  For no insight  Thanks for nothing  Nothing  No insight  Nothing extra there  Nothing learned  I'd rather fucking  Sit in a Volkswagen  And listen to Eric  Rave about Florida  Morning radio shows  Oof  What was that one  You love so much  Ooh  What was it again

[01:57:00]  No  Well the 4th  We'll do something different  And then a Halloween party  That is the real bash  Well I hope I've been counting  I want to attend this  Jimmy  I've got some information  For you  Guess who's playing  Johnny Cash  In an upcoming movie  I heard Joaquin Phoenix  Yeah  He may be good though  Yeah I mean maybe  He'll be good  Who knows  I mean he may be  Great for that  I don't know  He looks good in the park  But I mean  I just hope he doesn't  Whisper  Whisper  Yeah I'm sure he will  My name is Rob  And I'm on the radio 
[01:57:30]  I'm stuck and falls in prison  Time keeps tracking  I'm a boy named Sue  That train keeps rolling  On down the sand  I'm told  Joaquin you have to sing louder  My dad left home  When I was three  Well if they freed me  From this prison  If that railroad train  Was mine  I bet I'd move it on  A little farther  Down the line  Far from Folsom prison  That's where I want to stay  I'll let that  Loadsome whistle  Blow my pelouse  What about 
[01:58:00]  I shot a man  In Reno  Just to watch  All right  We got some  Heartbreaking audio here  Cool  We were talking about  This this morning  The man losing his wife  In the hurricane  Oh  Even  I think even the reporter  Was crying in this one  She was getting choked  It was awful  This is brutal  Crying like a grandmother  She was really not happy  Absolutely brutal  How are you doing sir  I'm a big girl  What happened  The house just  Split in half  Your house split in half 
[01:58:30]  Right here on  Hollingham  Bayville  You know  We got up in the roof  All the way to the roof  And  Water  Came  And I just  Just opened up  Divided  Who was at your house  With you  My wife  Where is she now  Can't find her body  She gone  You can't find your wife  No  She told me  She told me  I tried  I hold her hand  And she told me  You can't hold me  She said 
[01:59:00]  Take care of the kids  And the grandkids  And my kids  What's your wife's name  In case we can put this out there  Tonya Jackson  Okay and what's your name  Hardy Jackson  Where are you guys going  We ain't got nowhere to go  I know where I'm going  I'm lost  That's all I had  That's all I had  Longer for more jail  Wow  That's awful  Man  Boy that reporter really 
[01:59:30]  Kept her composure  I know  It's good to see  They never act like human beings  No they really don't  Wow  That's pretty tragic  That was brutal  Yikes  So  They're on the roof  And the house just came  Apart  Yeah  Just busted apart  And couldn't hold on to her  Yeesh  What about the people  That went up to the attic  And had no ways of  You know  Punching a hole  Punching a hole  Yeah that's what they're saying too  People that climbed into the attics  No way to punch a hole  Into the roof  And the water came up 
[02:00:00]  Into the attic  And they're going to find  A bunch of drowned people  In the attics  Or suffocating  Because the air can't get in  Yeah  Done  That's an awful death  Should have fucking left  When they told you  Were there any  Places that got actually  Covered with water  Like the houses got covered  Did it go up that high in places  Yeah  Completely covered  Completely man  A lot of these people  Didn't have a means to  To leave  Walk  Get out  Start walking  Whatever  In the rain  Feel the car  I don't know 
[02:00:30]  Get your ass out of this  Somehow  You do something  You do whatever it takes  To get you  And especially if you  You got a family  Get you and your family  The hell out of there  That's all  Leave  The problem is  If you got no money  There's just nowhere to go  If you got no cash  Like I mean for me  I would just book a first class ticket  If it was available  You get a limo  Takes you to the airport  Right  You go to the continental  Well they have to get the first class  You board first  Of course  And you're having a drink  While you're waiting to leave 
[02:01:00]  Yeah  It's easy  Well that's actually an important point  Because it's kind of a parody  Of the silliness of saying  Just leave  There really is  Some people can't leave  They're just kind of fucked  I don't know  I'm saying  If you have a family  You leave  You figure out something  You get the hell  Or try to figure out something  Out of there  At least get out of the bowl  That they're talking about  That is New Orleans  What if you got the old grandma  Now what 
[02:01:30]  Put her in a shopping cart  And wheel her ass  Out of the bowl  Actually I saw  One family do  Something similar  See  Old grandma in the middle of the boat  Did you see that one  Yeah  Oh man  Seriously though  If you got the older relatives  The sick  The sick  Guy in a wheelchair  What are you doing  With fucking wheelchairs  With hooked up to IVs and stuff  You gotta leave  How are you gonna leave  What  Just go  Well those people  You don't  They die  It's called  You're talking about the people  It's like the old limping zebra  Out on the plains of the Serengeti 
[02:02:00]  You know  He's gonna buy it  When everyone  All the little zebras  Poke their head up  And go  Uh oh lion  And they start running  And that little limping one  Is limping  Yeah you know he's buying it  Because uh  You have problems  On each and every front there  Every single front  Simultaneously  And in a very wide  Geographic area  Which is one of the things  That makes this  Particularly challenging  It's almost in many cases  Worse than the typical  Hurricane  That is much more  Concentrated in the area  That's devastated  So the ability  To get help  From the outside  A lot of raw sewage  From everything  From fresh water  To medical help 
[02:02:30]  Is usually much more easy  Than this particular situation is  The problems with sewage  Started with that  I mean because  Because of the way  New Orleans is built  And really any city  That gets flooded  Sewage automatically  Is going to start  Flowing right into the city  Right down the city streets  Exactly  So you have  First of all  People exposed immediately  To raw sewage  Which the sewage  Treatment plants  Of course are not working  Because the power is down  And secondly  You have sewage  Contaminating the water supply  So you not only have  The danger of the sewage itself  But also the sewage  Contaminating the water supply 
[02:03:00]  And thirst  And the need for water  Is one of the primary needs  That must be fulfilled  As quickly as possible  People will drink dirty water  People will drink dirty water  If they get thirsty enough  What about  I mean we heard this  Oh god  This is going to get  So much worse  Before it starts getting better  When I was young  I played behind a  Crousers in New Brunswick  With my buddy  I was like 13  Yeah  Just you know  Frolicking in the water  Because it was hot  And I drank a whole bunch of it  But I didn't realize  That it was  Basically it was coming out  Of like one of those  Giant concrete  Big cement pools 
[02:03:30]  It was sewage  And that night  I just walked into my living room  And vomited on the rug  I couldn't even  Yeah  Stop it  It's awful  Drank sewage as a child  A lot of it  I was thirsty  What are you stupid  I didn't know it was sewage  You're such a dopey little kid  I don't know  You're just drinking water  From this  This creek behind a Crousers  A creek  In Jersey  Yeah  Good job  I really  Should have done that  Go back to Fox  They had a story about 
[02:04:00]  Looters going through  The slot machines  Looking for change  Oh at the casinos  At the casinos  That's the place  They don't really know  What to do with this coverage  It's like  You know  New Orleans  Underwater  But Mississippi  Just completely destroyed  Or Biloxi  Whatever  Team coverage  They're all over  They're trying  They're trying  There's a few open gas stations  Alright  But how long are the lines?  Speaking of gas  We got a little Bush  A little Bush action here  Bush  President Bush is returning early  From vacation today  To deal with the aftermath  Of Katrina  And the White House says 
[02:04:30]  One of his first orders  Of business will be  To approve the release  Of some oil  From the nation's  Strategic petroleum reserves  An energy department spokesman  Says companies hit hard  By the storm  Have already sought loans  Of crude oil  From the reserve  A supply of oil  Kept in case  Of national emergency  The release  Was approved  By energy officials  Last night  And the president  Will address it  With a White House  Task force  When he returns  To Washington  Around 4pm today  At least  Eight Gulf Coast  Refineries  In the path of the storm  Have shut down 
[02:05:00]  Or reduced operations  Taking out anywhere  From 8 to 10 percent  Of the nation's  Production capacity  It could take weeks  Or even months  Before some are  Fully operational again  Experts say  The refinery's  Loss of power  Is a problem  But the flooding  Is the biggest obstacle  The Coast Guard  Says its crews  Have spotted sunken  Platforms  And oil rigs  In the waters  Its dispatching  Hazmat teams  To deal with  Related oil  And chemical spills  But says  Its primary focus  Remains on the  Search and rescue effort  Man 
[02:05:30]  How about this  Instead of  How about loaning  Them crude oil  How about just  Fucking giving it to them  Instead of  Forgiving foreign debt  30 billion  To get some  Scumbag  Third world  Shithole of a country  To agree with  One of your  Dumb overseas policies  How about just  Giving away  Some fucking oil  To people who  Pay taxes here  It's enraging  It certainly is  Nothing  Nothing to help  Drive down these  Fuel costs  And now it's even worse 
[02:06:00]  $70 a barrel  It's insane  Jesus  When they were  Talking about  You know  Will oil  Go over  $40 a gallon  Or a gallon  A barrel  A barrel  Right  40  Could those  Filthy Saudis  Help us a little bit  No  Of course they won't  Their asses  Are smooched with  All the time  By Bush  And nothing  And they do nothing  They're huge over there  In OPEC  Just do something  Raise production 
[02:06:30]  Pump out more oil  How about  How about some help  Scumbags  Because we're the only  Things preventing  The fucking  House of Sarge  From being overthrown  Yeah  Is the fact that  I think we also  Protect their  Nuclear weapons  So I know we do  In Pakistan  We kind of guard  Their nukes  So the radicals  Can't get them  Bastards  You get nothing  In return  Nothing  Animals  And it's not just  Bush  It's all  Politicians  It's all  Every American  Official on that level  Is tied into  Those creeps  Alright  Let's say hi 
[02:07:00]  To Pete  In Wisconsin  Pete  Hey what's up guys  Let's go Pete  You know  I was listening  To you guys  Talking about  These poor people  And you know  I was watching it  Last night  With my wife  And this guy  Was talking about  His wife dying  And that's sad  But you know  I turned to her  And I said  Look I don't care  How  I mean we have  Memes  We could get  In our car  And drive away  But I know  The police  Were supposed to  Go into these  Neighborhoods  And get the  Hell out of  Here  And what I  Don't get is  If these people  Walked up  They had by  What a day  And a half  Knowing it  Was coming  There 
[02:07:30]  Yeah  If they  Have that much  For warning  Aren't there  Buses and shit  You can get on  And go  I mean  I don't think  It's just a matter  Of the cops  Are just going to  Leave them there  If they say  Hey I don't  Have a car  Just to play  Devil's advocate  Let me ask you  Say you're poor  A lot of people  In New Orleans  Are broke man  You got no money  You got four or five kids  And a couple of babies  Where  You have no  You know  Your credit is shit  You got no money  Where do you go  Like are we going to  Get on a bus  And go to where  Don't they have  Those camps

[02:18:30]  On eggshells  Waiting for an excuse  To jump in and say  You motherfuckers  And by the way  9-11  We played  I don't know how many  9-11 tribute songs  From these schlep  Fuck ass musicians  Trying to capitalize on it  And goofed relentlessly on it  Is that joking about it?  Why not?  Oh we were goofing on the musician  But it was still making light  Of the situation  Don't  Don't try to  Don't try to inform us

[02:20:30]  That will be happening  At Mardi Gras  Next year  Mark my words  They will absolutely  Be ready  For Mardi Gras  To make money  And people will be shouting  Show us your tits  It's human nature  This is how things happen  There will actually  I tell you  The tour  The element of tourism  Is the one thing  That guarantees  New Orleans  Is probably gonna bounce back  Because people are gonna  Go down there  For Mardi Gras  Yeah  And people are gonna 
[02:21:00]  Want to go down  And people have a weird  Desire to do good things  Sometimes  As much as people are creeps  But especially  If they know it's safe  People will go  Let's we gotta support  New Orleans this year  And go down  And fucking drink  And be animals  And people  Mardi Gras  I guarantee you  This year  Will be an absolute  Mob scene  Yeah  More so than normal  People treating me  Like Rick Delgado  Or something  Why  A hat right on your head  Let's say hi to  Dirty Joe  Anthony's wearing a hat  Hey what's up guys  Hey little Jimmy 
[02:21:30]  Hey  I've been watching  All this Fox News footage  And like you guys  Were saying  They're going with  The whole looting thing now  I lost my little thing  I can't concentrate  Until I find it  Hold on sir  Oh we lost something  That's a problem  Oh B  What did you lose  You better find it  Or we might as well  All just go home  Things won't be the same  What was it  I guarantee you  What is it  The tip of the cap  From his pen  Yeah  Not even the thing  Not even the cap  No  The little metal  The thing  So this translates 
[02:22:00]  By the way  What he lost  Nothing  It was no importance  Take  It was important  In my messed up brain  Oh he would have  Looked for it  All right  Sorry  Sorry Dirty Joe  Go ahead  I got my little  Thing  All the looting  That they're  Focusing on now  And all the news channels  Fox News  MSNBC  And all that  And all this footage  I'm watching it  Over and over  And there's only one  Question that keeps  Popping into my mind  Where are the white  People at  New Orleans  White people  I mean  Looting  You can make all  The jokes you want 
[02:22:30]  But we've been down  There  It's predominantly  Black  Right  Black  Especially downtown  New Orleans  And believe me  If a little white  Town got hit  They'd loot  And there was some  Italian looking guy  With his hat on  Backwards  Being kicked out  Of a store  By a cop  Literally  The cop kicked him  Out of one of the  Broken doors  There are white  People looting  He looks nice  No they're not  And can I just say  One other thing  Dude what do you mean  No they're not  Are you saying  That in this situation  They're not  Or that white people  Wouldn't leave  Dirty Joe 
[02:23:00]  Seriously  Have you been down there  No no  I've never been down there  It's pretty much  At least 80%  Black downtown  In certain areas  It is yeah  I'm not surprised  I mean  I was just saying  It's pretty bad  That something like  This happened  And that's  That's what  They're trying to do  It's just  You know  Understeal  Whatever you want  To call it  We all  We all think  We're above  What you're seeing  On TV  No fucking way  If it happened to us  White, black, yellow, blue  You're gonna do what  All of a sudden  Your animal instincts 
[02:23:30]  Are gonna kick in  You're grabbing food  You're gonna be  Jumping into supermarkets  Looking for water  What have you  And if you see  The opportunity  To possibly  Take a pair of sneakers  Or something  You're doing it  Look at the way  Mob scenes happen  Most people in mob scenes  Are normal people  But when a mob  Just  You know  People act weird  With a mob mentality  Man  Love the mob mentality  Can I say  One other thing guys  Yeah  No  These idiots  That instant feedback  Email  Whatever  About your show  I've been listening 
[02:24:00]  Since day one  On NEW  I'm a member of  Whackbag  I don't feel the need  To go on there  And post  Or critique  Anything you guys do  Because  You guys have been  At it for a while  You know what the fuck  You're doing  Alright  9-11  I listened to every  Friggin show  You guys did  And that was  Some of the best radio  I ever heard  If I remember correctly  September 17th  I think it was  You guys were playing  All the stupid songs  That were banned  From radio  And Anthony  Was singing them  As Neil fucking Diamond 
[02:24:30]  Oh yeah  Remember that  That was fun  That was a good impression  And it was fucking hilarious  And it's one of the only things  That made me laugh  Throughout that time  But we went serious  For many shows in a row  We had no idea  When you start  Kind of  Coming around  And you know  Starting  And try to make people  Laugh again  You know  We had no clue  We had to make it up  As we went along  But you just gotta feel it  And I mean  You guys have been  I've heard that  We did a great job  During 9-11  I've never heard those shows  And have no desire  To ever listen back  To those shows  No fucking way 
[02:25:00]  I've listened to them once  Since I originally heard them  And just realized  How great they really were  And you guys have done great  With the hurricane  And you gotta joke  About something  You just gotta know the line  And you guys  Obviously know the line  We're getting it  Especially after being fired twice  We're getting it  We're hitting this story  From all sorts of angles  I mean you know  You have to  I mean you guys  Now that you're on XM  You've got totally different  Kinds of audience  I mean you've got  Totally different members  Of your audience  Now you gotta hit it  From every angle  I think there are  Some douchebags  That hear us talking  About the hurricane 
[02:25:30]  And then hear us  Laughing our ass off  At Jimmy talking  About the cab ride in  And think we're laughing  At the hurricane  Or I make a joke  About Ben's hair  Looking like a hurricane  Went through it  And it's like  Dude  Dude stop it man  Shut up  It's just annoying  As a true fan  Like I said  I've been with you guys  Since day one at NEW  You know  I emailed you guys  While you guys  Were off the air  You guys were really cool  About emailing back  That just made me  Even more of a fan  And go you know 
[02:26:00]  Get XM specifically  To listen to you guys  It's just annoying  And I wish people  Would just  If they're gonna  Listen to the show  Listen to it  Enjoy it  If you're not liking  What they're doing  Take the fucking channel  It's that simple  Thank you Dirty Joe  Alright guys  Later  Alright let's say  Hi to Stan  In Tennessee  Stan what's up  I was just gonna  Agree with Jimmy  I have a five and a half  Month old  And if this happened  Where I live  I'd be looting  Trying to get diapers  Baby food  Whatever  You know  You gotta do  What you gotta do  Anybody would loot 
[02:26:30]  I really believe  None of us  Is above actually looting  If the opportunity  Is there  And you're that desperate  And I'm not saying  I'm not justifying  Stealing Rolexes  And sneakers  And that kind of shit  I don't justify it  But I'm telling you  I think more people  Would  In that position  Would do it  It's as simple as that  I'm a pussy  I'm not the guy  That throws the rock  Through the window  But I'll be in there after  Absolutely  I don't break the window  But if the window's broken  And there's some shit in there  I'm grabbing  And I'm such a bad liar  If a cop is like  What do you do  I'd be like  Oh no I thought it was open  That'd be like acting  No I thought 
[02:27:00]  This door was open  Wasn't it opened  Alright Stan  No I thought  The lights were open  Thank you buddy  I bought this  Last week  I was returning it  Oh officer  Let's go to Jason  In Louisiana  Jason  What's up  What's up  Hey  Hey I got an update  For you on  Some people in the shelter  Yeah man  There was one  Relatively nice lady  That went to a port-a-potty  To brush her teeth  Dropped her toilet  Dropped her toothbrush  In the toilet  And wanted to reuse it 
[02:27:30]  Came back  Asked for some rubbing alcohol  To clean the toothbrush off  And wanted to reuse the toothbrush  Dude why would she be brushing her teeth  Over the toilet  Because the other toilets  Well I don't know  Why not a sink  In terms of what the mirrors  Didn't have  Weren't open  I don't know  Alright I'm moving on  Let's go to Jason  In Pennsylvania  That is bullshit  Kevin  Hey yeah I was just saying  I think a lot of people  Maybe didn't leave  Because all the fear mongering  That was going on  In the media  Every week  They've been hearing  About this storm  Or hearing about this  And they built everything up 
[02:28:00]  When the media built  This one up for them  They just thought  It was another time  Getting hyped  And didn't realize  How devastating  It really was going to be  Nah I think  I don't know  I think the majority of people  Still believe what they see on TV  Yeah  As the word of God  Word of God  Alright guys  Keep up the good show  You would like to think that  You know  Most people out there  Can see through the bullshit  But I don't think so  Do you know what clip we need  I got people in my family 
[02:28:30]  That just buy this shit  As it rolls off the TV  I'm like  Come on  It's so obvious  What they're doing here  Don't you see this  Says cops were looting  Saw looting first hand  Let's go to Allen  Taking you know  Food and things like that  Allen  That they needed  Yes sir  Who are you talking to  He just started his conversation  Before we picked up the phone  You're talking to your pal there  Yeah  I'm about 20 miles  Off New Orleans  I've seen them looting  And all that  And there's some bozos  Stealing TVs and so forth  That kind of thing 
[02:29:00]  But 90% of the people  Are just taking  You know  Things they need  Food  You know  And items  You know  Just to get by  Or what have you  You know  I mean  Walmart opened up  One of their stores there  And just told everybody  To help themselves  And that was literally  You know  Out of need  Right  You know  Obviously  I'm okay  You know  So I didn't take up  On that  But these people  Are you know  Desperate  You know  I mean  Given that situation  I don't care  Who you are  You're going to  You're going to  Loot  I think so 
[02:29:30]  Alright  You're going to  Loot  We got  Communications towers  Down there  And I'm in place  Just waiting  To be able  To access  Damage  To these towers  We can't go nowhere  Nothing we can do  People had cell phone  Coverage for a while  Because all that stuff  Was that battery  Backup  But that stuff  Is cluttered out  All the batteries  Are shot  So that's why  People can't communicate  Right  Alright Alan  Hang in there  Alright  Alright man  We got a problem  With Frank  For some reason

[02:33:30]  And that's something we deal with every day  That balance  I understand that you have a crap  So how do you not get the sarcasm  Because we're saying we care  We're not saying what we donate  What the fuck's the matter with you  You're missing the point  You're missing the point  I get sarcasm  And you know what  This radio show is doing a service today  I guarantee that  You know what I'll say is Frank  It's a pig that don't fly straight  Where are you from Frank?

Well  That's got to be a nice place to be  I have to work  So I guess Ant and I are pretty much working  So Jimmy can get to our status  And then we'll retire the show  Speak for yourself  I've spent more than five bucks a week 
[02:37:00]  Since we've signed our contract  That is a good point  Alright here let me give you something  Yeah just in here I've got to take a cab  Alright  I might be spending six bucks to get home today  I hope he still has checks signed by Dave Douglas  Come on  I got a good chuckle out of that one  That knows our old program director from Boston  He's an ass  Let's see  Forty-five miles an hour until the gas prices drop  What's that about? 
[02:37:30]  What?  Truckers getting together?  The truckers like to do so  Still there?  What's up Lee the trucker?  Hey man  Yeah hey  I'm trying something here in Detroit  Forty-five until the fuel comes down  Or the compensation goes up  I'm sick of it  I'm going broke every god damn day  Alright so you're going to be the one truck out there  With his flashers on  That everybody's honking at and going around  You'll know his name is Lee  Nope no flashers  I can leave until forty-five without them  Alright well enjoy that right lane  Just stay out of the middle of the left lane  Go as slow as you want  I can use the left two lanes  I'll tell you this man 
[02:38:00]  When the trucker's organized  They can get a lot done though  Well the truckers are going to lose more money  By being late with shipments  And they're going to save on gas  No no no  I'll get paid the same amount  They might figure something out  Make the freight late  That's what we're going to go for  Oh make the freight late  You're going to have bumper stickers made up  Hey we got to do something  God damn it  Every day I go to work  My wages go down  Everybody else will go up  Alright  When that fuel goes up  It comes out of my pocket  And nobody cares about the little guy  It's all the big business  They get all their fuel compensations 
[02:38:30]  And it does nothing for us  Well there's a hell of a lot of owner operators out there  And by God it's time to make a stand  And today is the day  That's the day I'm making it  Alright sir  Good luck to you  Boy there's a  Let me tell you something  That whole thing is going to start and end with him  No trucker  No fucking cranked out trucker  Is doing 45 miles an hour  No  Unless it's backing into the dock  Let's say hi to Eric in Orlando 
[02:39:00]  Eric  Hey what's up guys  Hi  Hey what's up  Hey first off  I want to say thank you for ripping that shit dick apart  I appreciate that  If he would have said that you guys donate anything  But it was  I didn't like his confrontational literal attitude  Yeah  He's one of those boobs that just knows  Like hey the government's counterfeiting money  I knew what he was  And I wanted to spit  I wanted to pinch his nose  And then spit into his open mouth  And the reality is the XM Nation is getting together  And there's going to be a whole Red Cross thing  That is happening across the channels 
[02:39:30]  Where's Kelly actually  Right on the front page of the website  There's a number to donate to the Red Cross and all that  So  Of course  I don't even  What is the number by the way  We have it in front of us  Hold on we'll get to you buddy  Hold on buddy  We'll just get out the phone number  Okay okay  800-HELP-NOW is the number  If you want to donate to the Red Cross  Okay  XM is teaming up with the Red Cross  In its effort to help the people in the hurricane damage areas  If you want to donate  800-HELP-NOW  Are you really Eric from Orlando  Yeah yeah  You're like my big idol Jimmy 
[02:40:00]  I call it sometimes on the show  Get through  Thank you  Do you listen to some  Do you know who the fiasco is  Yeah  Pat Lynch and Taco Bell  Did you ever go  Ooh  The fiasco  Because I know another Eric from Orlando  Whose head I want to split open with my elbow  Hopefully it's not me  Well that's why he said another Eric guy  You're safe  Jesus  No I'm the one who like spreads the virus in town  I tell everybody at my work  I play clips of the show so everybody can hear 
[02:40:30]  And they're like  Damn where are these guys on so I can listen to this shit  This is great  You're getting a good fan base down here  And I'm making it happen for you guys  Just to let you know  Alright thank you Eric  Let's say hi to Dan and Philly  Dan what's up  We love Philly  Hey what's up  Hey Dan  Listen I just wanted to tell all these people  Shut the fuck up man  Everybody that's bitching and complaining about you guys  And not being funny and not donating  They just need to shut the fuck up  Alright  And by the way  Maybe Ant wants to read the email we got 
[02:41:00]  It's just typical though  About somebody who will write something  And then not talk  Yeah  This is from Scott  Who wrote before about joking about the hurricane  Which we're not doing  Equating it to 9-11  And why didn't we joke about 9-11  Like just stop  I'm not going to call in to be hammered  Because he didn't like my feedback  I guess this was to Eric  He's commenting about me 
[02:41:30]  I'm not going to call in to be hammered  Because he didn't like my feedback  No thanks  It's not an argumentative point  It's my opinion that is obviously different than his  No  You can't now  I love when people cop this thing  Well that's my opinion  Why can't I express my opinion  You're not expressing your opinion  You were saying  That we were joking  About things that weren't being joked about  And you were being confrontational  Right  In your expression of that opinion  So again stop backtracking  You fucking 
[02:42:00]  You weasel  Yeah  What is it with his calling me names  Like he's in third grade  That is a good point  Did I call him an asshole  No  Or a fuck face  Did I call him a fuckhead  No  I realize he's joking  I realize he watches the same pictures I watch  And feels the same feelings  When is the time right to joke  I don't know  And I'm not telling him when the time is right or wrong  Yes you were  Yes you were  When I have my own talk show 
[02:42:30]  And put my balls on the line  Sorry  That's terrific  That's terrific  Then I will tell him  But I do not have access to a feedback box  A box which I thought was for feedback  And not just ass kissing  Now I know better  Yes now you do  That is for ass kissing  And you're being invited to call into the show  Stupid  It's not for ass kissing  We get plenty of abuse on there  And if it's justified 
[02:43:00]  Fine  Oh  Just the fucking nerve of him  To come in now  Like he wasn't being confrontational  You were  Hey  Leaving on a jet plane  LOL  You didn't write in  Dude how come you were singing that saint song  It sounded like you were making fun of something  You didn't write in  You actually wrote in with a confrontational point of view  So stop backtracking  And trying to change the meaning of what you said  It's all an inflection  And sometimes that comes out in writing as well  That's the whole gist of  Like he's reacting  As if I was singing a parody song  About the hurricane 
[02:43:30]  And not goofing on  First of all  The most thing we're goofing on  Is the news coverage  And the fact that  They absolutely will be back in business  You will hear when the saints come marching in  You will see the tits  On Bourbon Street  And the beads  And everything  Because that's the part that makes the money  And that's the part that's going to be rebuilt  And boy  You're a little sensitive  If you consider that  Joking about the hurricane  And the tragedy 
[02:44:00]  And it is a box for feedback  And your feedback was read  As it was written  Yep  Anthony didn't change the words  And then he smashed your feedback  And invited you to call in  And now you're saying  So I don't get hammered  What you're saying is  You want to express your opinion  Without any rebuttal  Whoa Calvin  Yeah  What's up Calvin  Hey how's it going fellas  Hey  Hey man  Hey big fan of the show  I just wanted to call in and say  I'm one of the truck drivers  That's listening every day  And I'm down south in Georgia and Florida  Spreading the virus for you guys 
[02:44:30]  Thank you  Are you slowing down to 45 miles an hour?  No I don't think I should man  That's a little too dangerous for me  Alright  Well thanks Calvin  Alright you guys have a good day  We got to cut you off  Because Tom from New Orleans  Is checking back in  We talked to him earlier this morning  Hey put the strudel cake  On the top thing  And then the strip  And like the steak  On the bottom  Yeah Tom's got food  What's up Tom?  Oh hey guys  What's going on?  Hey  Yeah we're just  Trying to cook  And survive 
[02:45:00]  It was strudel cake  At least you got food  Yeah  Gotta cook it for it  Goes bad  Yeah  Yeah like a little coffee cake  You know those things  Water coming up  Or are they going down?  In the city it's going up  Dude your dog's out front  Yeah they're showing Bourbon Street  And it looks like the water's  A little higher now  Yeah  But I mean it's going down here  I'm thinking we can  We might make a dash  To the interstate  We're going to  You know  Eat a little bit  And then  Drink the beer 
[02:45:30]  Before they get hot  And then decide  Where we're going to go  And get in the car  Get drunk and drive  Yeah  Wow they're just showing  Lots and lots of footage  Of the looters  I saw it on TV  I went out this morning  Afterwards to listen  To XM a little bit  And watch TV  Don't use your AC by the way  If you drive man  Wait until you're  Actually out of state  Before you use your AC  You're going to kill your gas  I got plenty of gas  I got gas right down the road  In Baton Rouge  Why aren't you going to have to  Be at the line  I've been using my AC  In the driveway dude  Alright  Yeah  Hot  It's hot  Hot as balls 
[02:46:00]  Why don't you  Why don't you do something  For the hurricane release  Like what  Like fly me and my buddy  Out of here  I actually would  You need to get out of there  I'd be willing to put you up  In a hotel far from where I live  I'd be happy to  You would  Yes  Alright  Why don't you come on up  To New York  You know I don't talk like that  You gotta get to  An air poet  I don't talk like that  Other dude  That didn't get it  No  You guys  You guys actually  Hadn't been dicks to me  You know  Well not to your face  Alright  We like you 
[02:46:30]  You're our only hope man  Come on  Get me out of here  If you can get to an airport  Because obviously  How far are you from an airport  That is functioning  Probably about  80 miles  Okay  That's drivable  Yeah  Well if you get to an airport  You know  We'll make sure you get somewhere  Like where  Myself and Opie and Norton  We'll make sure that you get somewhere  Tell me where  I don't know  Where do you want to go  Uh  Vegas  Miami  Jesus 
[02:47:00]  Alright good  Way to just  Way to maintain  We'll fly him to Biloxi  Alright Tom  Well dude  I'm telling you  It's bad  The news station  Has now switched to prayer  The governor  That lady  Is leading everybody  In a prayer  To stop the water  I don't know  If that's really going to help  If that's going to help  Too much  But uh  And you're praying  To the god  That made the hurricane  Right  Please undo the shit  You just unleashed on us  Two days ago  Thanks  He knows what he's doing 
[02:47:30]  Leave him alone  And all those people  Because I've been listening to it  They got people now  Um  Mostly the urban section  Uh  Calling and  And basically  You know  I'm in my house  How do I get there  And they're telling them to walk  And  Kids  And you know  You got water  Uh no  We got some cookies  And these people  Should have prepared  A little better  Alright  Yeah  It's bad though dude  But I think  We're probably  That's going to be it  We're going to  Cook the rest of the food  And get out  And go somewhere  I need to shower 
[02:48:00]  I need to shower  I need some real air condition  Just  Watch TV  Do you know  If there's a road  You can get out on  Yeah  I-10 west  I-10 west  Yes  That's uh  Open  That's open  And we're like  We're on the edge  The western edge  Of the city  On the western edge  Of the parish  Ah you must have been  Yeah  You got lucky  If I get to I-10  Then I'll be fine  Alright Tom  You know  We'll check in with you tomorrow  Alright  Alright  If I'm by a cell  Ben's got my cell  My cell will work 
[02:48:30]  If I'm out of town  Alright  Thank you Tom  So call this number  If I don't have to call you  Hang in there  Good luck  I will  Alright there he goes Tom  Some more audio coming in  And a massive refugee moving effort  About to get underway  Remember all those folks  We've been telling you about  Who have been holed up  In the Louisiana Superdome  Ever since well before the storm hit  They are going to be transported  There are plans underway right now  For a gigantic convoy of buses  To take those folks  From the Superdome in New Orleans  To the Astrodome 
[02:49:00]  The 40 year old structure in Houston  Folks in Houston  Been wondering what to do  With the Astrodome  There's even been talk  Of tearing it down  Well it is going to serve  A very big purpose now  Sheltering all of those folks  Up to 15,000 of them  Who have been holed up  In the Superdome  Under absolutely horrific conditions  They don't have running water  The toilets are all backed up  They don't have power  So now some of those folks  Many of them in frail health  Are going to be bussed  To the Astrodome 
[02:49:30]  In Houston  Are you kidding me?  They're transferring them  From one Superdome to another?  To another stadium  That one will have running water  It will have food  At least they'll be able  To prep the place beforehand  Sure  Right  And yeah  It's got power  Air conditioning  They could bring in  Portable toilets probably  To have extra  For the crowd  Yeah  They'll clean them  Whose job is it going to be  To clean the bathrooms  At the Superdome?  How long of a drive is that? 
[02:50:00]  Does anybody know?  That's got to be pretty far right?  That's got to be 10, 20 miles  I might say even farther than that Anthony  Taking all the people  Inside the Superdome  To Houston?  Let's do a quick  To Houston?  Houston  Let's do a quick  Hello  Math here  How many people can you fit on a bus?  Right  Probably  Because I know  I know you can fit  On certain aircraft  You can fit 16  And on other certain aircraft  You can fit 24  I don't know what it's like 
[02:50:30]  In the back of the plane  I only know what it's like  Up in the front  Right  I don't know how many  Can fit on a bus  I don't take buses  It's got to be what?  75?  You can fit 6?  50 miles  You can fit 6?  Well you know that's in the back  Of a stretch limousine  I don't know how many  Can you fit in a bus?  You could fit about  I'd say  50, 60 people on a bus  Alright so let's say 60  Let's be nuts  Big bus  60 into 20,000  That's a lot of buses  Yeah that is 
[02:51:00]  Get out of the calculator quickly  Or rip your facial hair out  Yeah it's about 350 miles or so  Wow  That many people  350 miles to another stadium  Of one bus at a time  I'm  What?  What?  I'm getting a Nathaniel  Are you getting a communique?  Writing down  I'm getting an urgent communique  From Nathaniel  Why doesn't he run in?  Approximately 300 buses  Approximately 300 buses 
[02:51:30]  Now I'm also thinking  They could probably  Once they get the people out  And onto highways  That actually work  They could probably  Get more transportation  Like you get them  Out of the stadium  Into a staging area  Where they could then  Load them onto buses  Not like you'd need  To bring all the buses  To the stadium  And then bring them all out  You know just kind of  It's going to probably  Take time to get them  To an area where they  Could be loaded on  All the different buses  But the Astrodome 
[02:52:00]  Is going to seem  Like the Hilton  After that awful conditions  In the  Or the Wildlands man  Yeah  You're right the AC  And someone at some point  Is going to have a  Toilet brush in one hand  And a bucket in the other  And have to enter that bathroom  You know some guys  Are going to try to call out sick  And they're going to be like  We need you today  But look man  I know it's my turn  For toilet clean up  I'd prefer  You have to come in  Feeling a little ill today  Imagine you walk in  And you just see that  Heaping helping  Poking up through the seat 
[02:52:30]  Staring at you  No it's as high as the seat  Because you can't flush it  No  They're going to be  On double duty  Oh baby stop  With the word play  Duty  Every stall looks like  The inside of  Dreyfuss' living room  This means something  Let's go to  Let's say hi to  Jim in Charleston  Jim  I'd like to commend y'all  For a certain  I'm not going to  Defend all of it  But a certain amount  Of y'all's coverage  Monday was great  When y'all would play  The Fox News alert 
[02:53:00]  And they reported  That the puke  Had been washed clean  On the streets  Of Bourbon Street  Reported that  The Fox News alert  And he would come out  And he would  Look back  Oh boy  We were using Jim  To make ourselves  Feel better  And his phone stinks  Hmm  We got some  Dramatic audio here  From CNN  Many people decided  To ride out the storm  In the wake of  The previous storms  This season  They had the false  Impression perhaps  That they were more secure 
[02:53:30]  And in some cases  They waited perhaps  A little bit too long  To evacuate  Let's go and talk  To someone who has  Been through that  As a matter of fact  As we speak  Ashley Markison  If you'll come over here  Please  Ashley is looking  For her husband Jason  Ashley tell us  First of all  What happened  On the morning  Of the storm  The morning of the storm  Me and my children  Were at my mother's house  Right off of gauze  And we took it  Well the morning of it  Oh goodness  The morning  Before it even happened  The night before 
[02:54:00]  We took in  We left to go  From our mobile home  And my husband  Was still trying  To fix things  Around there  And found my little  Girl's cat  That she got  For her birthday  And we wound up  Going and bringing  My kids to my mom's house  And some of the stuff  That I had  And I was mind  Saying I was going  To go back  And get them  And by the time  I was able to  Go back and get them  It was too late  And he told me  No just stay  Because the winds  Were starting to pick up  And my stepdad  And my mom said  No don't leave  And we stayed there 
[02:54:30]  And I had contact  With them  All through the storm  And he called me  Quite a few times  And he was in the bathtub  And I could hear the wind  Going around the trailer  And it was  It was horrible sounding  I mean  It didn't sound like that  Where we were at  But it was horrible sounding  And it just  It was  Okay  When I finally  Was able to  You know  When I had a storm  Was the last time  I talked to my husband  And my kids told him 
[02:55:00]  That they loved him  And they wanted him  To come up with us  And he told him  As soon as the storm  Was over  And he could get out  He was going to come to us  But I haven't seen him since  I've been looking  All over the place for him  You went back  To the mobile home  Of course  What did you see there?  My mobile home  It's got at least  Ten trees on top of it  There's no  Structure damage  I'm sure  That once the trees  Finally start setting in more  It's going to wind up  Caving in through the house  I know he got out 
[02:55:30]  Because he took  His good shoes off  And put on his work shoes  And my son's bike  Is missing  And I'm thinking  That he got out  After the storm  Wall passed  The second time  And he took  And that's  When people are  Explaining to me  That I've seen  At the Hampton Inn  That it's friends  Mine that stayed there  Said it was after  The eyewall passed  And they thought  It was okay  That the storm water  The lake punch train  Came rushing in  And I don't know  If maybe he was  On his bike  Got knocked over  I've been to the hospitals  I'm being optimistic 
[02:56:00]  I have children  That cried to me  At night time  But they want their daddy  And I promised them  I promised them  That their daddy  Would come home  And I don't want to  Break it  They're my kids  I don't want to  Ashley Markison  We wish you well  Thank you  Back in a moment  I'm actually  I'm listening to the call  What she's saying  Her husband was there  Was she there with him  Or was she there on the phone  She was on the phone  Oh okay okay  As the storm was coming  She could hear it  It sounds like  He could still be okay though  Obviously she's upset 
[02:56:30]  And worried and everything  But it sounds like  He might have got out  He got out of there  After the hurricane  He got in the tub  Is that what she was saying  To kind of protect himself  Yeah  And then some trees  Crashed down on the trailer  And then he got out  But it's very hard  For people to get in touch  With each other  In this situation  It's not like where Tom is  I guess  Where some of the phones  Are working  Because the lines are buried  You know  There are a bunch of people  That just cannot  Make any kind of contact  With loved ones  The governor is saying  Katrina obliterated 
[02:57:00]  25 to 30 miles  Of Gulf Coast  Ouch  And his face is cut up  Bob you were telling me  You were on that  Inside the second story  And the water  We're 10 feet above sea level  Right here  But the water was up  Into that window  Yeah right  I had a big wave  That some debris hit it  And came in  And knocked me down  And I got about  A 3-4 inch piece of glass  Up my thing  You know  And I had to lay prone  For about 6 hours  Glass in your back side  Right  And then they  Took me to the hospital  And they  Sewed me up 
[02:57:30]  And pulled the glass out  And the cuts on your face  Are from glass as well  When you were trying  To keep the window  From breaking  Screw the cuts on his face  I want to hear more  He got glass on his ass  He goes on my face  Like I say  I got out cheap  Yeah let's start  Walking to the back  I know you want to show me  Something back there  No let's not walk  Tell me more about  The history of this place  This has been here  41 years  You were telling me  Right yeah  My mother opened it up  In 1964  And of course  Take a look at the back  In 69  And Camille hit in 69  And after Camille hit 
[02:58:00]  My mother built  This building right here  And said that  No storm ever  Knocked me down again  Right  He's walking a little  Gingerly isn't he  The building stayed there  But it got kind of gutted  The back of his pants  Look like a Japanese flag  During this hurricane  You know  Too many Japanese flag jokes today  Not enough  Not enough  Because getting people  To understand  Alright they're just  Walking around  Discussing stuff  I got glass up my thing  Up my thing  Up my thing  And they pulled it out  Yikes  Who else was thinking  Pee pee hole  That  Ooh 
[02:58:30]  He  He's a glass up his ass  But he's fine  Alright  But  Yeah he's walking  He's right  Hey where's the  There was chicks outside  For what  Yeah where are they  They're almost ready  They're almost ready  What are they doing  What do you mean  They're almost ready  Filling out paperwork  We saw them a half hour ago  40 minutes ago  They're getting ready  To come in  They're doing something  For the show though  They're not full of paperwork  Because I'll rip your hair out  Oh Jimmy 
[02:59:00]  You're a glass act  Holy crap  I just told Anthony  What was going on  You know  During the breaks  We all run for leaks  Or  My little bladder  And Jimmy's little bladder  We  We take leaks  During every break  So we're in the bathroom  And you know  Today's show is kind of  A different type of show  And  There's a lot of tension out there  And seriousness  And  Also trying to have a little fun 
[02:59:30]  And  It's a little weird  To be sitting here today  Yeah  So I'm kind of expressing that  To Jimmy in the bathroom  As we're taking leaks  You know  We got a stall between us  You know  Going ah man  This is exactly what I said  I'm like I'm done with today's show  I just want to go home  It's one of those weird shows  And  I can't wait for 11 o'clock  Blah blah blah  And I'm saying all this stuff  At the urnals  At the urnals  And I'm like  Why isn't Jimmy commenting  He usually has something to say right  Yeah  So then I  Turn to wash my hands  And  The mirror  Is 
[03:00:00]  Directly across from the urinals  And I catch a glimpse of Jimmy  His pants are completely down  To his like  His knees  Like you know  When you go to a sporting event  And  And little kids have to take leaks  And  And they pull their pants all the way down  Because they don't know any better  They just don't know  So they pull them down on their ankles  Right right  Take a leak  That's how Jimmy  Is taking a leak in the bathroom  I start howling man  And I walk out  And Eric walks in  As I'm leaving  And all I hear  As I'm walking back to the studio 
[03:00:30]  Is just laughing  Coming from the bathroom  Because I hiked  My shirt up  To show the goodies  From the back  You're just an ass  Thanks for the laugh though  I needed that today  I was afraid I was going to piss on my belt  I'm glad that panned out okay  Once again  If you want to help out  The Red Cross effort here  1-800-HELP-NOW  Is the phone number  Alright
