<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of the Amanda Berry kidnapping case and the subsequent media frenzy surrounding Ariel Castro and Charles Ramsey, focusing on the conflicting public perception of Ramsey due to past domestic violence accusations.  This led to a broader conversation about online outrage, spurred by Anthony Cumia's tweet about Jodi Arias's attractiveness, and the hosts’ experiences with online criticism.  Jim Norton shared a personal anecdote about a violent argument with a girlfriend, and the hosts discussed the psychological aspects of violent crime.  The segment concluded with speculation about Arias's post-conviction interview and the future of broadcasting.  The show featured highly offensive language and depictions of graphic violence throughout.

Next, a host recounted a near-violent argument with a former girlfriend, seguing into dark humor about the difficulties of covering up a murder.  This transitioned into a discussion of the *Jerky Boys* movie and their prank calls, with audio clips played from the trailer. The hosts criticized the movie's quality and shared their own prank calling experiences.  A disastrous interview with the original MTV VJs (including Martha Quinn and Alan Hunter), featuring audio clips, highlighted Roland's unpreparedness and the VJs' discomfort. The segment included commentary on the VJs’ careers and their book, "VJ: The Unplugged Adventures of MTV's First Wave," along with more MTV News clips featuring Alan Hunter.  The hosts then debated the merits of eating Chinese food cold or reheated, followed by a bizarre anecdote about one host’s childhood song about cold macaroni and a segment of listener "F.U." calls.  The segment concluded with a Dish Network commercial and the arrival of Colin Quinn in studio, resulting in brief banter about Quinn's new show.

The show continued with a raunchy discussion of the hosts’ and guests’ past experiences, particularly focusing on excessive alcohol consumption, explicit details of sexual encounters (often involving intoxicated individuals), and recollections from their time at MTV, mentioning specific locations like Lloyd Harbor, Long Island.  Anecdotes about interactions with celebrities like David Lee Roth and David Bowie, along with behind-the-scenes MTV stories, were shared, including details about an MTV communication coach. The conversation veered into discussions about the Constitution, the Second Amendment, racial issues, gun control, and a report about missing girls.  Alan Hunter and Martha Quinn joined the show, adding their perspectives on their MTV experiences, including anecdotes about their interactions with celebrities and the show's format.  A humorous story about Jim Brewer repeatedly "raping" a fellow actor to break his character was also recounted.

Martha Quinn and Al (last name unspecified), promoting their book "VJ: The Unplugged Adventures of MTV's First Wave,"  shared anecdotes about their time at MTV, including interactions with Ozzy Osbourne, Madonna, Bob Dylan, and Bono.  Their germophobia and aversion to handshakes became a running gag.  Comedian Jimmy (last name unspecified) then joined, discussing his recent Parkinson's diagnosis and his experiences with the illness, often using dark humor.  He shared stories about the hospital and his reactions to his diagnosis, and engaged in a comedic bit involving Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cobretti, and a discussion of Run DMC's Aerosmith cover.  The conversation became lengthy and vulgar, touching on Jimmy's personal experiences and views on life. The hosts promoted their upcoming appearances and Jimmy's book and stand-up show, followed by off-air comments after the segment's official end.

The final segment started with a discussion of Rick Crom's health issues, followed by a Mother's Day advertisement for Stephen Singer Jewelers, humorously juxtaposed with morbid jokes.  A Pajamagram advertisement followed.  The hosts announced the show's end and the upcoming Sam Roberts after-show with guests E-Rock, Troy Kwan, and Roland.  A running gag about an intern, "Alan Thicke Jr.," was included.  The after-show featured Roberts recounting a severe illness involving prolonged vomiting, even expelling an ice cube, and a discussion of his unsuccessful Entertainment Weekly audition.  Troy Kwan's upcoming trip to Cancun was heavily discussed, with much joking and concern about his safety, particularly from drug cartels.  The "Fandango" connection to DJ Who Kid and his mixtape was also mentioned. The after-show concluded with more discussion about Roberts' voice and appearance, advertisements for Dollar Shave Club, and final send-offs to Troy Kwan before his trip to Cancun, ending with farewells and mention of Ron and Fez.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg Audio!  Antonio!  Ooh!  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6am and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:00:30]  Woo!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flesh it.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten egg from Sir Wibs.  Oh, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting. 
[00:01:00]  All in eight every day, that's what I said.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the ground.  Would you like to make up a pizza again?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat petty white sass.  She's my indie, right?  It doesn't smell too bad. 
[00:01:30]  Anthony.  The rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you want it.  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horns should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  This one's going to hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:02:00]  Not palaver.  Stop it with the palavering.  And get on with the program.  Hi, everybody.  How's everyone?  Hello.  Aw.  So good.  I'm just looking for something on the Twitter from yesterday.  I'm reading updates on this fucking Castro guy.  Yes.  A horrible person.  It's, uh, wow.  It's amazing when investigators can find out in 24 hours, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  They really dig in there.  Well, they interviewed the girls and went into the house, looked for some evidence.  I guess the two brothers of this Castro guy weren't arrested.  I can't believe they had nothing to do with it.  That's so weird.  How do you fucking live in a house?  They did live there.  No, they didn't.  No?  No.  I don't think so.  No.  Oh, then fuck me.  I was paying a little more attention to Benghazi yesterday than I was this story.  But I thought they lived there.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  I guess, let me think.  If my brother is out there in Port Jeff where he lives, and he had three girls captive in  his house, I'd probably know about it.  You may?  I bet I'd know.  Well, did they ever visit his house?  He didn't let anyone in.  See, right there would be a red flag.  I'd be like, why the fuck can't I come over?  It's dirty.  He was always like that.  Yeah?  They said this guy was always like that.  Yeah.  Oh, then fine.  Just let him go then. 
[00:03:30]  Sounds like a great guy.  I was in the gym yesterday in the locker room watching the, uh, yeah.  Yeah, it was really hard to constitute any television.  With all that cock flopping around.  It was so hard to concentrate.  I kept looking from the TV to the cock.  Of course.  And, uh, it was, it was cool watching the girl come home.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was sad, man.  A little homecoming after, uh, ten years.  God, that's gotta be fucked up.  Yeah, I guess he fucking, uh, would offer these girls rides. 
[00:04:00]  That's how he got a guy, at least a couple of them.  The girl at Burger King there, he was like, oh, my son works here at Burger King.  I'm picking him up.  Um, I'll drive you home, and then I'll come back and drive him home.  And she's like, okay.  Ten years later, she goes home.  Oh, my God.  What would he do, pull a pistol, or would he assault them?  I mean, do we know that?  I don't know.  Uh, I don't know.  It doesn't really matter, but.  Yeah.  No, he just, he would say, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take you home, and then he wouldn't.  I mean, there's new young, you know, girls. 
[00:04:30]  Like, you don't really need a gun to, to do that.  Yeah, but it helps.  I'm sure it does, yeah.  Very, very sad.  Yeah, that, and, um, I guess, uh, they were afraid to leave, because he would pull shenanigans  every so often, where he would, um, like, kind of leave a door unlocked, and, and go  outside, and just kind of hang out there, and wait for one of them to come out, and  be like, ah, you, beat him up, get him back to the house.  He had to come and beat the shit out of him.  Yeah, and that would keep him so on their guard about leaving, that, um, this, uh, Berry 
[00:05:00]  girl, Amanda Berry, she didn't know, what the fuck, was that door was kind of left kind  of open, and, uh, she went to get out, but even then, she was scared shitless.  She was freaking out, that's why it was so ballsy, what she did.  Yeah.  They said that's why she screamed instead of trying to open the door, because she was  afraid she was going to get beat again.  So, you could just scream.  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucking real.  You know, I read about a kidnapping where a guy, he had raped this, um, killed this guy, 
[00:05:30]  and he kidnapped his wife.  Oh, it was a home invasion.  And, uh, he took her to his house, and he would, you know, I think he raped her, but what  he would do is, he would, she said one time that she wanted to call 911, but he was leaving,  and she just sensed that he was waiting to see if she tried to escape.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And she said she waited an hour, and, uh, kept her eyes closed like she was sleeping, 
[00:06:00]  and then she sensed that he moved, and left.  Like, then he really left.  Oh, after an hour?  Yeah, but that's probably common with guys like that.  They wait, they watch to see what you do, and they test you, and...  Yeah.  Oh.  It's gotta be very difficult to keep tabs, especially on three women, to keep them in  one house for ten fucking years.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  I mean, how do you...  But that gives me more faith in humanity, that it wasn't the brothers, too.  Yeah.  Like, the fact that three people could keep this secret is much more upsetting than the 
[00:06:30]  fact that one fucking piece of shit.  on the lunatic.  Yeah.  Fuck.  And they're saying he got the, uh...  He would, uh, make them celebrate their anniversaries or their kidnappings?  Yeah, yeah.  Give them cake.  Like a birthday cake.  And, uh, hey, a happy fucking three years.  Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine, nine, that's like, that's a long fucking time.  That's a big chunk.  Just be somewhere you don't want to be. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And being treated terribly.  Raped and fucking beaten up.  What?  SiriusXM?  I was just thinking that, as I said, it's someplace you don't want to be.  All of a sudden, a liar walks in.  Hello.  Hello.  They just told the reporter that her own missing persons flyers were in the basement  cell, possibly to mock her.  Oh, man.  That's, uh, yeah, he's a sadistic motherfucker.  Yeah.  I wasn't just like, hey, you know, I...  I like... 
[00:07:30]  I like you.  I'm going to keep you here and treat you nice.  That's like, he was getting off on the sadistic aspect of the whole thing.  They watched their own, um, vigils on TV.  Why would he give them access to TV like that?  Like, that's really...  I mean, obviously it worked with these...  What Anthony just said.  Yeah.  It's sadistic.  Sadistic, yeah.  Must have thought, like...  Look at what you have no control over.  They must hate this.  Oh, I love it.  Wouldn't that give you more...  I mean, again, I don't know, but wouldn't that give you more hope if you thought there 
[00:08:00]  was, uh...  People cared about you and there was vigils.  Maybe.  A couple of schools that thought there might make your hope go out the fucking window.  And you're like, oh, they're looking for me.  There's nothing I could fucking do about it.  Nah.  That's just, uh, a sick fucking story.  And Amanda...  They said Amanda, uh, Michelle Leck got impregnated, knocked out five times.  Oof.  But he would beat her until each kid died.  He starved her for two weeks and then punched her in the stomach until she miscarried.  Oh, starved her for two weeks. 
[00:08:30]  I get hungry, like, I don't have my breakfast.  Dude, by the end of the day, I'm fucking nauseous and cranky.  I like how people use that word.  I'm starving.  Are you?  How about two weeks without food?  And you're eating for two.  Especially someone like Jim who gets something new every hour.  Yes.  Like, you know, you need your strawberries and your blueberries and your eggs.  Yes, he's a grazer.  Can you imagine not eating for two weeks?  Eh, it's gotta be a little hungry. 
[00:09:00]  And he'd probably just do that to make it a better...  Yeah.  And there's nothing in between when you punch her.  There's no indication why he would do that to, what's her name, Michelle?  Yeah.  And why he had a kid with Amanda.  Like, they haven't figured that out yet.  I'm guessing, betting, because he liked Amanda more.  Maybe.  But he threatened to kill Amanda if the baby died during birth.  And the baby was born not breathing.  And Michelle gave CPR to the baby.  Oh, wow. 
[00:09:30]  Until she started breathing on her own.  So he wanted the baby with her?  Yeah.  For some reason.  Well, the mother said that he called.  When he kidnapped this one, he called Amanda Barry.  That was, I think, the one he probably liked the most.  Just because he called the mother and goes, she's gonna be my wife.  She's with me now.  She's gonna be my wife.  She got...  The mother got two phone calls from this girl's cell phone.  Like, the day after she got kidnapped.  And what did she think?  Print caller?  Print caller?  No, she knew it was from his cell phone.  Oh, oh.  And, um... 
[00:10:00]  So, wow, yeah, maybe he wanted to knock her up.  How fucking...  And she get birthed in an inflatable pool.  Nice.  And the kid apparently didn't know the names of the other two girls.  So, that when she would go out with her dad, she wouldn't be able to say,  Oh, Michelle Knight lives with me.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  She didn't know who they were.  So, did he keep the daughter chained up?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't know, but I don't think so. 
[00:10:30]  Only because when she was rescued and she's screaming, like,  I want my dad, I want my dad.  Like, you know, I don't think...  Yeah, she might be like, Oh, good.  I don't have to be chained up.  Yeah, I think she probably led the most normal life out of...  Wow.  She was yelling, I want my dad?  Yeah.  You were talking about that yesterday.  Well, he's going to prison.  Yeah, I don't think...  Yeah, she's not going to prison.  He's going to fucking prison.  And our big hero of this whole episode, Charles Ramsey, of course. 
[00:11:00]  We've seen him on all the news shows.  His interviews are very funny.  He gives a very urban street viewpoint of the whole thing.  He was apparently the guy that heard her yelling and screaming,  trying to get out of the fucking door,  and helped her get out.  And he's being dubbed the big hero.  Well, whoops. 
[00:11:30]  It seems they didn't take him long to dig into his background there.  And he's got a couple of incidents of beating the piss out of his wife.  A little domestic abuse.  I guess he was also ordered to pay like 50-some-odd dollars a month for child support,  which really busted apart those stereotypes.  Not a dime.  Yeah.  Well, he's broke.  He's busy.  And then, of course, divided right down racial lines on Twitter, 
[00:12:00]  what I notice is black people are like,  why don't you leave him alone?  He's a hero.  He's done this.  And his background and past shouldn't matter in anything,  which, you know, it's true.  I don't give a shit.  But, I mean, it is, you know,  when you put yourself out there, you're in the news like that,  it's unfortunate, but it becomes fair game.  Like, I personally don't give a shit.  I could care less.  But I find it very entertaining. 
[00:12:30]  Other people are just outraged that they would do this,  and character assassination.  But, yeah, white people don't seem to care.  It's just like, oh, it's a news story.  Black people are very angry that this news even came out.  Well, I mean, the news is going to come out.  It's one of those things where, you know,  I guess they see this guy being called a hero.  Like, hey, man, this guy saved some kidnapping.  And then, of course.  You know, if you're black, you're like, of course.  Why?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why?  It isn't being reported widely, though. 
[00:13:00]  Honestly, I don't think it's a big, like, I feel bad for the guy.  There's like one daily news article had it, like,  towards the bottom is like one sentence.  Yeah, it was on the smoking gun.  Yeah.  They, of course, dig into everything.  And, yeah, I mean, who cares?  Yeah.  It doesn't make them less of a hero.  Fuck no, it doesn't, you know?  Although, there are people that just are never, never forgiven for that by, you know, women's groups and whatnot. 
[00:13:30]  That's true.  You know, so.  Normally not.  I don't see any, like, because he's just being hailed for what he did.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think anybody would, would, would, uh, even women's groups aren't going to give a fuck.  It's like.  But is McDonald's still going to, you know, use him?  Because they don't want that kind of heat.  And even if it's just a few people, which it usually is when people raise a stink about something, just a few people.  But, uh, you know, does McDonald's want to take that on as he's promoting Big Macs and whatnot? 
[00:14:00]  He's sure.  Every fucking interview, every interview with McDonald's.  We get it.  You'll love McDonald's.  And that's where you bring these girls.  That's, that's one of the, they were just forced to eat McDonald's all the time.  For years, they probably, that's all they had.  How'd she not get fat, like, the, the, Amanda's not fat.  He probably didn't give them much food.  I mean, they said they were very malnourished.  Oh, oh, right.  McDonald.  Tell you one thing, what are they doing down there at McDonald's? 
[00:14:30]  Not drinking milkshakes, I assure you.  We have audio of this, uh, was there, uh, oh, was there audio of a guy who said that he was the hero and not this guy?  Yes.  The neighbor?  A neighbor is saying that, uh.  Is there audio of him?  I'm the hero.  I read the story.  I read the story, too.  I don't know if there's audio of him, because he doesn't, he doesn't speak English.  Oh, I thought there wasn't in the, uh.  No, that's why he's being.  He no speaky.  No.  Uh, he's saying that, uh, hey, I'm the one that fucking got her out the door.  And, um, Charles didn't show up until she was already outside. 
[00:15:00]  What the fuck?  So then why is this guy not getting any press?  Because he don't speaky.  Oh.  And I'm sure he's not as, uh, colorful a gentleman as Charles Ramsey.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I thought it was.  Is that him?  Yeah.  Does he have a translator?  Let's hear this.  All right.  All right.  Chris, you've been out there all day.  You were actually an eyewitness to a lot of activity still going on there. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, Danita, it's still buzzing here tonight on Cleveland's west side.  You know, we're learning so much more about the neighbors who helped free the three ladies  after a decade of captivity.  News Channel 5's Stephanie Ramirez continues their live team coverage tonight.  And, Steph, one neighbor in particular is truly a hero.  Chris, a very interesting yesterday when we got on scene here on Seymour Avenue, a Cleveland  police officer brought this gentleman to me saying that he helped Amanda Berry by kicking  down the door.  That gentleman we spoke to yesterday, he doesn't speak English, only Spanish, and we spoke to 
[00:16:00]  him again tonight.  I asked Angel Cordero if he thought he was a hero.  The 32-year-old simply said, with a smile on his face, and in Spanish, I helped her, and  I was first.  You see, Monday afternoon, it wasn't just Charles Ramsey to the rescue, and going back, you  hear it in his interview.  We can't get in that way.  The we Ramsey was referring to sounds like the same person a Cleveland police officer told  News Channel 5 on Monday, knocked down the door at 2207 Seymour Avenue. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, boy.  Ramsey arrived after she was outside with the girl.  The girl, Amanda Berry's daughter.  But the truth, who arrived here, who crossed the street, who broke the door, it was me.  When Del Tejeda, who lives across the street from where the rescue happened, said Ramsey  and others...  Where is this fucking neighborhood?  ...and when Amanda Berry came out, she was given a phone.  She was able to call police from my house.  But this is the interview making headwaves across the world.  I knew something was wrong when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms. 
[00:17:00]  Something is wrong here.  The problem is we weren't on camera.  Joking, but saying they're not jealous.  I did what had to be done.  Imagine how the family feels today, he said.  They have their daughters.  But isn't that typical of the media, just to get it wrong?  Totally.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but...  Well, they put a mic in front of...  How are they supposed to get it right if he doesn't speak up?  That's true.  Well, maybe ask him, you know...  Ask Ramsey. 
[00:17:30]  Ask everyone standing around there?  Yeah, maybe ask Ramsey, you know...  Do you have any help?  Who helped you?  You know, can we talk to him?  They just...  You know, they got Ramsey.  He's fucking gold.  He's gold.  What do you think?  This guy's going to be like,  Hey, did you see Angel Cordero on the news?  No, no one's going to say that.  But, uh...  Boy, they love fucking Ramsey.  Angel Cordero, the name of a jockey back in the 80s.  I used to bet on him.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Angel Cordero.  Little monkey.  They'd call him.  They'd yell at him.  Yeah, little fucking monkey.  It was great.  So that guy's the real hero.  Yeah, well, that's what he's saying, but...  That's it.  It's fucking...  That part of this story will never get any fucking heat.  You're right.  It's all about Charles Ramsey now, no matter what the truth was.  You don't think it's going to come back and get as much attention as the other one got?  Done.  You think it's six months when Dr. Phil has the reunion?  Right, right.  He's going to be there? 
[00:18:30]  And here it is.  Let's bring him out here, the man that saved you.  And she'll be like, oh, and he'll be like, yeah, motherfucker.  I'll save that bitch.  Who are you?  No Angel Cordero to be found on the stage.  Yeah, that's funny.  The guy came across and opened the door and did everything.  This guy just showed up.  He shows up.  Yeah, I'm the hero, bitch.  He hijacked this guy's hero stance.  He really did.  So what do you think McDonald's was going to do for him? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, they're probably going to give him free shit, put out a little presser for about that.  And depending on his background, perhaps throw him in a spot real quick, a local fucking spot maybe.  But I don't think anymore.  I think they're backing off old Charles Ramsey.  You don't think they'll use him in a spot considering he did time for beating his wife?  And he's not the original hero there?  When we go out to McDonald's, my wife can't burn dinner. 
[00:19:30]  He only excuses why McDonald's is good for him not beating his wife.  When you go to McDonald's, it's so easy to clean up.  You ain't got to beat your wife's ass to have her wash no dishes.  And you ain't got to make a fist to see onion rings around her eye.  You can just order them.  Yeah, so that was one of the big stories.  Here's my question, too.  If this poor girl had five fucking miscarriages, how is he only charged with three counts of rape? 
[00:20:00]  Four counts of kidnapping.  Oh, the daughter is considered kidnapped?  Okay.  Oh, interesting.  I guess this is like their preliminary shit to hold him.  Yeah, from what I understand, he had to be charged within 36 hours?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  They throw that on there, and then they investigate everything and come up with more charges.  And he wrote a note, like, this is in 2004, but it was some kind of confessional, like, where he blamed... 
[00:20:30]  I mean, it was like, I know, I read part, he said, like, I'm a sexual predator, I need help.  And then he detailed some of the shit about the kidnapping.  Yeah, and he had, like, a fucked up childhood, and he blamed it all on his childhood.  Oh, boy.  And he blamed the girls for getting in the car with him, right?  Yeah, they got in the car.  Hey, they got in the car.  Well, there you go.  Yeah, what do you want me to do?  I think that's a pretty poor defense, if that's what he's going to run with in court. 
[00:21:00]  Hey, they got in the car.  Well, case dismissed.  They got in the car.  You know what's weird?  Like, that's the oldest thing in the book.  Don't take a ride from a stranger.  Don't get in the fucking car, you dummies.  I mean, at least with DeJesus, he wasn't a stranger.  All right, but I mean, it's just weird.  Don't get in the car with anyone.  You don't get...  It's so fucking basic, and that shit that your mom drilled into your head so many times.  There's a reason for that.  Yeah.  That's why parents come up with, like, you know, code words and shit like that. 
[00:21:30]  I think that works.  I would...  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  I have the code word, but you could just pull up.  Kids are so stupid.  Mine's Bosco.  Hi, Bosco.  Bosco.  Bosco.  You could just pull up to a kid, though, and be like,  Hey, there's an emergency at your house, and I have the code word.  But I don't want to say it here.  Get in the car, and I'll tell you.  And it'll be like, Okay, you stupid little fucker. 
[00:22:00]  No, you dummy.  What a genius idea.  Code word.  Yeah.  What's the code word?  Uh, open Saskatchewan?  Open Saskatchewan?  Open Saskatchewan, really?  Imagine if the guy just guessed it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Orange Julius!  All right.  Good guess.  Kids start coming in, and you're like, Wow.  That was a lucky guess.  That worked.  He doesn't remember the code word, either, and he's just yessing me to death.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a terrible thing, though.  Yeah, it's predators.  Fed them through the hole indoors. 
[00:22:30]  This obviously can be an amazing book out of this.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  House of Horrors.  House of Horrors.  It's being used everywhere.  House of Horrors.  I love a good House of Horrors story.  There's been a few of them over the years.  They show the picture of the house.  They put the headline, House of Horrors.  And, you know, some horrible stuff went.  Oh, in that house.  Yes, yes.  The other big story.  Guilty.  Yep.  Arius.  Wow.  Jodi Arius. 
[00:23:00]  Did you see the pictures of her pussy online, dude?  She was fucking sexy.  Show me.  Oh, there's pictures of Jodi Arius naked online.  Pull that up.  Yeah.  So I could pull on this.  Please.  Yeah.  I was fucking, I was tugging my fucking, I was tugging my dick just from the shaft and  bag.  I had my bag lifted and wrapped around my shaft like a cloth.  Yeah.  She's on her hands and knees.  Yep.  That's her too.  Those are all her.  Oh, let me see that one.  Yeah, that's pretty good right there.  Look at the vagina on her. 
[00:23:30]  She was really sexy.  Whoa.  What the hell?  I like the fact that her cheeks are separate.  Look at her ass.  She has a gaping asshole.  There's a sex picture.  Testimony did come out that she did take in the asshole.  Ah, that picture's fucking dry.  She's crazy.  Enjoyed a little, what a fucking lunatic though, man.  Wait, did she have implants?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She had weird breasts.  Weird, perfectly round breasts.  Breasts, it just says.  And I was looking at autopsy photos.  Not autopsy, but crime scene photos of the guy.  What a fucking brutal murder that was. 
[00:24:00]  The slit in the throat.  It was all over the place.  No, I just Googled something and they all came up in the same image bank, really.  The slit in the throat one was fucking, oh, it was like his jaw, the bottom of his jawbone  was showing.  She just fucking, thank God they remembered to shut the curtains for the pictures we just  showed.  Yet, you know, my snotty fucking nose, there's no way I could blow anything out of my nose.  Are there no tissues in here?  Because even after, bitching.  Didn't we do this on there?  I had the tissues in there.  I don't know what the fuck.  Where are they? 
[00:24:30]  Maybe they're here.  Let's talk to Killie Rock.  When did you have them here?  But they should be.  I know, right there.  Like, like right there.  How hard is that?  Fucking tissues has turned into such a fucking production that it just, it's beyond me.  How tissues.  After the gym show yesterday, I specifically put them aside into the bin, made sure they  were here, and I don't know who walked off with them again.  Okay, well, someone keeps doing it. 
[00:25:00]  This morning?  What?  Did you put them on the table this morning?  I had them with the bin in here.  And as they were setting up.  Today?  This morning.  Who checks to make sure that the studio didn't go?  Where did they go?  That's not even the box.  I just opened those up.  Where's the box?  The other one was like a silver gray one.  Who sets up the studio?  Yeah, who sets up the studio?  Who sets up the studio?  So who checks it?  Where's the intern?  It's gonna...  Get that fucking...  Jesus fucking...  No one checks that.  No one checks the studio.  Who took the tissues out of here?  That's what I wanted. 
[00:25:30]  Find out the big tissue caper.  That's what I wanted.  Where did the tissues go that were in here?  I put them in the box.  The box is there when I was there.  Eric put them in the box.  This morning?  You put them in the box.  Well, when I was...  What?  Alan, you're not even in the room.  I want to know.  Where were the tissues this morning?  I didn't...  They weren't inside the bin that I used to set up the studio.  I packed them yesterday, but they weren't there when... 
[00:26:00]  Someone removed them from the bin.  Yeah.  So why didn't you realize that there were no tissues up here and get a new box of tissues?  Because I'm pretty much automated in the morning.  I don't...  I didn't think about it.  Well, part of the automation should be looking to see that there are some tissues up here for snotty noses.  He should catch it, and then the supervisor who's supervising the studio setup should catch it.  Of course.  There is none.  Oh, there's none?  Oh.  Nobody checks the studio if the intern's to set it up. 
[00:26:30]  Oh.  So that cancels the second tier.  It just astounds me.  It's such a big issue.  It's such a difficult thing to do that every day...  Where was it, Iraq?  You don't know.  Where was it, Iraq?  Where was that box?  Shut the fuck up.  They were on the floor, just laying off the floor like they fell out.  The floor where?  In the office?  Right near the office, yeah.  Maybe they fell out.  That's what I just said.  I know, but you made it seem like they fell out. 
[00:27:00]  And they probably just fell out.  I think there's a possibility of them jumping out.  Oh, boy.  This should not even be an issue.  It should.  And once again, it is.  Right.  I can't believe that the tissues are the big breaking point here.  Gotta get a supervisor, I guess.  It's not...  Yeah, someone should check the...  It's not...  An employee of the company.  Yeah.  Now you get the hell out of here.  It's not a major issue, but it's like...  No, it's such a stupid issue that it shouldn't be an issue, is what it is.  It's a small thing.  It's just...  It astounds me. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Where were we?  Jody.  Jody Arias.  Let's get back to her.  Jody Arias.  A little bit of a controversy there on my Twitter, of course.  It was...  When the verdict came in, of course, they say there's a verdict, and then there's like an  hour before they announce it.  So during that time, a lot of people were tweeting the fact that there was indeed a  verdict in.  So I tweeted, Jody Arias' verdict is in.  And I put, fuckable.  Like, the verdict on her is that she is indeed fuckable. 
[00:28:00]  And she is.  Right.  And fucking, of course, she's fuckable.  Well, I guess that upset tweet...  What is it?  Tweety?  What is the fucking thing?  That Twitter fucking police?  It goes around with that Michelle Milken fucking...  Wait, what is this?  Tweety what?  What is it called?  Twitter...  No.  Fucking...  Ah, come on.  Somebody get on that fucking... 
[00:28:30]  See, I can't even remember the...  Twitchy.  What is Twitchy?  What is Twitchy?  It's some fucking...  They try to make news out of Twitter.  And like, oh, look what's happening.  Look, see, they say, what difference does it make?  Eric Nordstrom fights back tears during Benghazi's statement, and then they'll have Kristen  Powers there talking about it.  And then you keep going down.  All right.  Yeah, find that one.  Uh, and, um...  There it is.  No, that's the Michaela... 
[00:29:00]  No?  Moroni.  I make Twitchy a couple of times here on my wonderful...  I just like the quote.  Anthony Cumia.  Twitchy.  Stop being tattletale pussy.  Yeah, because they're little tattletales.  Little tattletales.  Uh, see if...  Twitchy.  Ew.  Oh, there it is.  Let me see Twitchy.  Your first name is Pig?  Pig.  Anthony Cumia.  It says Pig.  Anthony Cumia.  You like it, do you?  You bet I do, and I would, too. 
[00:29:30]  I'd fuck her, too.  You know what bothers me so much about them getting self-righteous about it?  Yes.  And this is why that they should just fucking kill themselves.  It's because what you're saying is really blunt and ugly and true.  The reason that we are so focused...  Her looks and the looks of Casey Anthony...  Right.  ...are absolutely a part of why people are fucking fascinated with them.  Why they're even watching and paying attention to this case.  Do you know how many murder cases are going on in this country right now with ugly people? 
[00:30:00]  Yep.  Yeah, you never hear about it.  This has that...  That are far worse than this.  Right.  This has that sexual thing, you know?  She's very sexual.  She's kinky.  She took it in the ass.  And she fucking, you know, ravages her lover there with a butcher knife.  Uh, but she's hot.  And guys think, yeah, I'd fuck her.  So I put there, the verdict is in.  Fuckable.  And then, of course, I had a hashtag, Jody Arias, so it would get to people that wouldn't 
[00:30:30]  understand the joke.  Not just my followers, of course.  And then Twitchy puts pig Anthony Cumia, quote, and then a little, you know, quote, accused,  and now it says convicted murderer Jody Arias is fuckable.  Twitchy is this, it's like, this is why I fucking, people make me so sick when they  get upset.  Yeah.  Because, with the Menendez trial, these good-looking boys killed, her looks are absolutely a part  of why people are interested in her.  Absolutely. 
[00:31:00]  Why?  And then there was, uh, because of that, I guess people get the word that, um, that I'm  on Twitchy, that something happened on the Twitchy.  So, this fucking guy, and where is this one?  Oh.  It's the Facebook guy?  Yeah, the Facebook guy.  What was he?  Some, um, conservative dickbag.  Oh, figures.  Uh, what happened there?  Facebook now coming up?  Uh-oh.  What happened to his page?  Oh, maybe his page down? 
[00:31:30]  Uh, some fans might have, uh, gone to him.  He goes on this, oh, here it is.  Uh, let me see if I can...  Let me see if I can find him.  Yeah, it's...  What's his name?  The...  Conservative Insurgent.  The Conservative Insurgent.  Ew.  Read his profile.  How embarrassing.  Because he's...  I'm a political insurgent fighting against liberalism, tyranny, Islamification, multiculturalism,  and socialism.  Now, how come I can't agree with this guy?  Is his face on there?  No.  Why would it be? 
[00:32:00]  37,000 likes, though.  Why would it be?  And, um, I guess he, uh, he was a little upset by my Jody Arias comments.  Oh, was he?  And, and...  But, but he doesn't even do the slightest bit of research, like reading, reading five of  my tweets to, uh, see what I'm all about.  Yeah, I think, I think he, he deleted it.  Yeah.  My, my, my, uh, my army of, um, followers, uh, let him know the what is. 
[00:32:30]  Uh, go to that picture, though, so I could read what, what he wrote.  Uh, Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony Show tweets Jody Arias is fuckable.  Yeah.  Anthony Cumia thinks Jody Arias is fuckable.  There are a lot of Opie and Anthony Show fanboys out there.  I have...  He's spelling Opie wrong, by the way.  Of course he is.  I have absolutely no idea why.  Cumia is, of course, a typical liberal moonbat and misogynist pig who can get away with  BS like this.  Personally, I'd love to see Cumia pair up with Jody Arias. 
[00:33:00]  Maybe Cumia would get the Travis Alexander treatment, shot in the head, multiple stab  whoops, and throat slit from ear to ear.  What exactly is so sexually appealing about Jody Arias?  The fact she's disgusting, cold-blooded murderer?  The, uh, the fact she got convicted of first-degree murder?  I guess I'll just never understand how a liberal's mind works.  What a dumb motherfucker this guy sounds like. 
[00:33:30]  What a fucking, an ill-informed dummy.  No, no, I mean you.  Oh, right.  But I mean, like, take the joke that you made and to give it a literal response.  Literally.  The insurgent, conservative insurgent is a cunt.  He's a dumb fuck.  And the fact of the matter is, I, you look at her picture without knowing the context.  I said she's fuckable.  She is fuckable.  Not fuckable for the fact that she slit her boyfriend's throat, although it adds in a little  mystique. 
[00:34:00]  Uh, but the fact that she's just visually, she's appealing to a man.  Not, not, not a fucking guy like, uh, the, the, uh, conservative fucking insurgent.  Conservative insurgent.  Insurgent.  Dude, she got one thing right.  Yeah.  Misogynist pig part.  I bet Kumia thought Casey Anthony was fuckable, too.  Well, he did get that right.  He wrote that.  I'm sure Kumia, uh, thought his remarks were humorous.  They were.  But there's nothing funny about a young man tragically losing his life at the age of 30 
[00:34:30]  because he was murdered by some jealous, crazed, psycho, C slash NT.  Wait a minute.  You're, if you're a misogynist pig.  Yeah.  Why is the conservative insurgent writing cunt?  Even though he beeped out the whole word.  Oh my God.  Why are you a misogynist pig for saying that you want to fuck Jody Arias, but he's not  for making a gender attack by a cunt?  That's horrible, Jimmy.  You're absolutely right.  Uh, there are some very sick minded people out there.  Most of them liberals.  At least justice was served against Arias. 
[00:35:00]  It's just deplorable that liberal losers like Anthony Kumia try to put these vile killers  on a pedestal.  This guy, whoa, swing and a huge miss.  Yeah, you lefty.  I'm a lefty.  I love that.  And then everyone who commented on it, pointing out that you're like a registered Republican  conservative, he would just deflect the issue and say, uh, it's not a funny joke.  Well, of course, he's just a, he's a fucking douche and a party killer and a baby. 
[00:35:30]  Well, it was a little too much for him to handle because he fucking bailed and deleted  the original post, all the replies.  Cause I even replied on it.  I said, look, I'm fucking, uh, I go, I'm the furthest thing from a liberal.  I go, if you just looked at my avatar picture, you'd fucking at least get a hint.  I'm not a liberal.  I have a fucking 50 caliber with a scope on it.  I'm looking through.  And then the other Facebook one, I'm holding a pistol at the camera yelling. 
[00:36:00]  What's wrong with you?  The conservative insurgent.  What an embarrassing name to give yourself.  Like, look at me.  I'm an insurgent.  I'm a conservative insurgent.  Yeah, I'm fighting.  I'm fighting.  You're not.  You're not fighting.  You're some tool at sitting at home trying to be heard under a fake name.  He's an asshole.  And then another guy came out of the woodwork to give me shit.  And he turns out, you know, he's another one of these fucking right wing religious fucking conservatives. 
[00:36:30]  Those guys are the worst.  They are fucking horrible.  Shut up with your holier than thou bullshit.  Fuck you.  He comes out with his name was something Douglas, I guess, if you could find it down there.  Was it on Twitter?  Earl?  Yeah, yeah, it was on Earl.  Fucking Earl Douglas.  Michael?  Frederick?  And, yeah, he wrote some shit about how horrible it was that I wrote that Jody was fuckable.  It makes you so sick because the fascination, like, these people are glued to their TV. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, you have empathy for the victim, of course, but that's not why they're glued to their TV.  No.  It's the same shock that Susan Boyle was a great singer.  We can't believe an ugly fat pig is so gifted.  That's part of the morbid attraction to this case.  We can't believe such a beautiful girl or such a girl that I would be attracted to under other circumstances is involved in this or is guilty of this or is capable of this. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  So her looks are a part of it, you fucking fakes, you phonies.  Douglas Nelson?  Yeah, they...  Douglas Nelson?  Douglas Nelson?  Is that him?  Let me see.  Is it...  No, it was like, it was like, uh, at underscore Douglas, I think was his, um, his tweeter.  His tweeter.  But he, uh, he got all on me and stuff.  And all you gotta do is read their, people's profiles, for the most part, to get enough ammo to just slam them. 
[00:38:00]  So, of course, when he said he was pro-life, I had to just completely go after the abortion angle.  Yeah.  I, I informed him that perhaps, um, if he, him and his wife were having any children, that they should abort them.  Uh, and then I, I, I think the, the, the nice, fun way to, to say that, I think I said, you should, you should hoove that dummy maker.  I don't think he appreciated that his wife's dummy maker should be hooved. 
[00:38:30]  And you know what?  People will cry about being bullied.  He bullied me.  Like, people want to say whatever they want to say and then cry when you respond.  Yes.  Exactly.  You want to fucking say shit?  I'm going to say shit.  It's an open fucking forum.  Have fun with it.  Why not?  Yeah.  So, and just for saying that she's fuckable.  She is.  Any fucking guy, first of all, any just heterosexual guy that's being honest can look at her without looking at what she did or any of that whore shit and go, yeah, okay. 
[00:39:00]  She would be considered, there he is, Dan Donald.  Oh, it's Donaldson.  Sorry.  Dan Donaldson.  And his avatar, his little picture, his profile pic, is Captain America's shield.  How old are you?  Yeah, it's Captain America's shield.  No picture, of course.  But, yeah, he's quite the conservative. 
[00:39:30]  Dan Donaldson is an ass.  He's a marketing, SEO, web development, hockey nut, movie fan, pro-life student of libertarianism.  Yeah, sure.  Views are my own.  It's from Indiana.  Verdict is in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wrote, he wrote the verdict is in.  What did he write?  The verdict is in on Anthony Cumia.  Yeah.  On the XM bird because no one would carry them. 
[00:40:00]  Lower than basic cable above junk mail.  Well, that's the, uh, that old gag where it's like, oh, he's on.  Oh, right.  No one listens to you.  No one would carry us.  So, uh, uh, yeah, because where we really want to be right now is some local fucking FM station  where we are completely gagged to be able to speak.  Shut up.  Love doing satellite radio.  I do too.  Unfortunately, not for this company, but I love doing it.  There's only so many satellites orbiting the earth could do it on the weather channel. 
[00:40:30]  I guess they got a satellite up there.  Yeah.  If I can, the spy satellite show.  We're in great shape.  If, if, if Buzz Aldrin was right and we do colonize fucking Mars, we're in perfect shape  to be broadcasting.  Right.  We have experience with satellites.  I want to do a gig on Mars.  Great.  Yeah.  I wonder if that'll ever, uh, happen where we colonize the moon or Mars and, and, and  and entertain.  Cause you never think of that.  You always think it's scientists and fucking people. 
[00:41:00]  But then after a while, entertainers go, it's like, where are you playing?  Ah, I'm playing moon base alpha.  Ah, tickets are still available.  Call a crater.  Here's what I predict.  This is a future prediction.  Oh, future Jimmy.  Let's just say it's 500 years from now.  Let's say Ray Kurzweil was right.  Let's just say for the sake of argument, human DNA has been 100% mapped and the brain  has been mapped. 
[00:41:30]  So we know how to save all thoughts, everything that makes Anthony or Sam, who you are and  Jim, we can save onto a computer hard drive.  The mystery of God or all that shit has been figured out and we can upload everything we  are into a hard drive.  Cause it's all electrical impulses.  It could take three or four K sparkling personalities.  So let's say that can happen.  Now we're already making body parts in 3d printers.  We can't, um, you know, do a full body yet, but let's just say 500 years from now, we'll 
[00:42:00]  easily be able to replicate a full body exactly as it is in a printer.  Whoa.  Instantly.  So what would the, how hard would it be to have a body of yours replicated, say 10 light  years away and then have your fucking every piece of information about you sent over there  and put into that fucking body.  And so that sounds crazy.  Then what happens to you?  You just, I can picture you just kind of almost in a matrix thing, sitting in a chair, like 
[00:42:30]  a place where your body would, uh, would be and just wait for you to get back.  Wait, wait for you to get back.  I don't know.  I'm sure that'll, that'll be figured out, but it's not as crazy as it sounds crazy, but  it's not fucking.  Yeah.  It'd be like changing clothes, right?  They just beam your info across there.  Look at what's happening.  Everything with these Google glasses, everything we look at now, let's just say again, let's  go a hundred years from now.  Everything you look at is saved and captured and put on a hard drive. 
[00:43:00]  So every experience, every human has is captured and saved on a hard drive or captured and  saved somewhere.  And your thoughts are too, because once we figure that shit out, it's no longer a mystery.  Oh, the thoughts and the dreams.  Oh, of course not.  Oh my God.  It's going to happen.  Kurzweil was right.  He's a fucking smart guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah.  Kind of frightening.  Yeah.  A little image of the future.  Oh, it sounds great.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Just zappy over.  Where are you going?  Oh, planet snook. 
[00:43:30]  I'm going to planet snook.  Oh, we have the Jodi Arias interview.  This is after her conviction, right?  Who the fuck got access to her?  I know.  Probably Sam.  One question.  Oh boy.  Do you like green persona?  Ah, what's in your biak piak?  Yeah.  We should probably play what you have, because this is like seven parts and they're all like  three minutes.  Oh yeah.  Okay.  Immediately after giving this interview, it was told that she would not be giving any 
[00:44:00]  more interviews.  Why is that?  Because she said stuff.  I don't think she's supposed to.  Let me see.  Well, they're still sentencing.  And with her conviction of murder one, she absolutely can get that death penalty.  That's what she wants.  So, yeah, she has said she wants it, but...  Yeah, I think this was the big quote, explaining why she would prefer a death penalty.  Ah, right.  Let's listen in.  By the way, A, she might be using reverse psychology, because she doesn't want it. 
[00:44:30]  And B, when you're convicted, how do they sit silent when they're convicted?  How about this?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  I'm always very curious as to the mindset there.  But her little chin was going, frrrt, frrrt.  Yeah.  She was almost ready to go.  And then the lawyer does that insincere pat on the back and rubbing of the shoulder, because  they're obligated to do that, I guess.  How do you show no emotion?  I love the ones that do.  They collapse. 
[00:45:00]  But it's rare, you know?  Usually they're very composed.  Yeah, how does a lawyer give you sympathy, like rubbing your back, like, I'm going to  go home.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to go to jail forever.  I'm going home.  I'll talk about this moment right here.  All right, I'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah, you're going to prison.  Forever.  Forever and ever.  I failed on this national spotlight to get you off.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry, I failed.  Yeah.  You know, or you just lean over.  You know, it's pretty hard on me, too.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, this is my career here, we're talking.  I can't believe we lost.  Yeah, we lost. 
[00:45:30]  This is so bad for us.  Yeah.  Automatic appeal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, this will go on for a long time.  Did she say, by the way, why she, because she brutally killed this guy.  She said it was self-defense.  She said he was very abusive.  Came after her.  Yeah, he came after her.  That's the only defense she had.  There wasn't even a question as to whether she did it or not.  That wasn't the case.  The case was, was, did she have any justification whatsoever to do that?  The murder was so brutal that it had no, none of the earmarks of a self-defense killing. 
[00:46:00]  It had all the earmarks of a passion killing.  One of these, you know, girlfriend, boyfriend, boyfriend, girlfriend type of overkill murders.  It wasn't a self-defense.  Do you know, because I think he's, he blogged once or something and said, I'm dating an ex-murderer.  Oh, wow.  Can you look that up?  She is.  Travis had written that.  What is it, Travis?  Oh, Travis.  No, not the Travis that should have been stabbed.  The one that unfortunately was. 
[00:46:30]  Travis Teff was stabbed by his dog.  Are you focusing on the court or are you focusing on what could be the, the worst outcome for you?  Well, the worst outcome for me would be natural life.  I would much rather die sooner than later.  Longevity runs in my family and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural life in one place.  You know, I'm pretty healthy.  I don't smoke and I would probably live a long time. 
[00:47:00]  So that's not something I'm looking forward to.  I said years ago that I'd rather get death than life.  And that still is true today.  I believe death is the ultimate freedom.  So I'd rather just have my freedom as soon as I can get it.  Ultimate freedom.  If, you know, if the religion thing doesn't come into play, if it does, yowch, you are in Dutch.  If she thought this thing was bad news, imagine realizing there's a hell.  Well, she goes to heck. 
[00:47:30]  She'll be Satan's concubine.  She thinks she likes taking it in the ass.  How about a flaming, hot, pointy devil tail?  Just fuck.  It's a good song.  Satan's concubine.  How does that go?  Satan's concubine.  His songs are terrible.  Horrible.  All the same.  He just wants to be cool so bad.  I know.  He really does.  He thinks the devil's cool. 
[00:48:00]  I know.  It's a Satan.  Although I do like, what is it?  Satan's circus?  The devil's circus.  Which one was it?  Oh, yeah.  It was the devil's circus.  The devil's circus.  Yeah.  Can I hear a little of that?  Fuck yeah.  This is terrible.  He's acting like he's trying to be cool in seventh grade in 1996. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  Do you think Chip wears Jenko jeans?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely wears Jenko's.  Oh, Chip.  What did he write?  He blogged less than a month before he was killed.  In a lengthy blog post titled, Why I Want to Marry a Gold Digger, he shared his thoughts  about the perils of being single and his desire to change his priorities to date with marriage  in mind.  This is his quote.  Desperately trying to find out if my date has an axe murderer penned up inside of her 
[00:49:00]  and knowing that she's wondering the same thing about me.  That's usually when I think myself into a panic and start acting weird in consequence  to trying so hard to act normal.  Oh, wait.  Is he saying he said my date?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I don't think he's.  He's not saying.  He was speaking figuratively.  Okay.  I forget.  Yeah.  I did.  I was.  I think you're typically speaking.  Yeah.  It was more of an ironic twist.  It's like when you say, oh, she's a psychopath.  Oh, this, you know, it's like it's just anything.  She.  Yeah.  It's she's on a period. 
[00:49:30]  It's like assuming every girl you date is an axe murderer.  Yeah.  And then dating one.  And then you date one.  Right.  You know, I think that's even even a broken clock.  Right.  Do you think they had fought before?  I wonder if they had fought.  Like I told you, I finally broke up my girlfriend when I got so mad.  I went out to the knife drawer.  Oh, Jimmy.  Fucking and handled the knife and buttered some toast for her.  I certainly did.  I'm like, he had a bit of this is cheese bread like my grandmother used to make.  Like, it'll make you stop being a total cunt. 
[00:50:00]  But I just knew that that's how these things end.  What was the process going on in your head where you would even like you could think to  yourself, fucking love to just thrust a knife into her throat or something like that.  But the second you start walking towards, that is a giant leap between just thinking about  anything and actually setting it in motion, regardless of how far you go.  Yeah.  You set it in motion. 
[00:50:30]  That's very scary.  Yeah, I know.  It really frightened me.  What were you thinking?  What were you going to do?  I knew I wasn't going to, but I remember when she was yelling, it was like really late.  It was like three in the morning.  And I was just, you know, I'm so tired.  Oh, it always is.  These dummies.  I wanted to go to sleep and she just wouldn't stop this one night.  And again, believe me, I was a shit boyfriend half the time.  So it's.  Was she yapping?  Yeah.  But this was one night where she wouldn't stop.  And I remember as she was talking, I kept, I could feel my right arm. 
[00:51:00]  It was pitch black.  I could feel the arc of it as I wanted to punch her.  Like how it would.  What it would be like to swing my arm.  I could physically feel my arm itching to go to drill her in the face.  I'm like, I can't do that.  And then I started just getting murderously angry.  And I'm like, I want to fucking stick a knife in her.  I want to stick a knife in her chest.  And I went out to the fucking kitchen.  And again, I didn't walk towards the bed. 
[00:51:30]  I just, more to also take a breath.  Okay, get out of there.  I'm just, I would love to fucking stab her.  I would love to stab myself.  Like I was so.  Wow.  Angry.  That's how that shit happens, I guess.  That is how it happens in a moment.  It keeps going, right, right, right.  In a moment, or especially you're drunk or you're, you know, you take something, it hurts.  Or you have a gun.  That's where guns scare me.  Because in that moment, if there was a gun right there, I would, I don't know if I would have  shot her, but I absolutely would have stuck in her mouth. 
[00:52:00]  Without a doubt, if I had a gun in that moment, I would have stuck it in her fucking mouth.  Jesus.  That's nuts.  And that's why I don't own a pistol.  But you got to believe so many of these things probably happen.  Like I think most of these weird cases are not crazy premeditated things.  Right.  They're just those moments where it's like in this single moment, you just impacted your  entire life.  And you ended theirs.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  Yeah.  And then in this case, though, they found premeditation. 
[00:52:30]  And so she got the murder one.  Yeah.  Kind of hard.  I guess she had this background of being a little kooky.  Is that it?  But that's why sometimes you got to know when to walk away.  Like my anger was my own problem.  But I saw like that's how this could end with her.  And even if it's not something dramatic, even just a physical altercation.  I've never had one.  Was she demeaning you?  Was she?  No. 
[00:53:00]  Just.  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck?  Like she's she was fierce.  Oh, and she would argue nasty and I would argue that, but she didn't know.  I told her, like, I like I'm willing to stop talking right now.  Yeah.  Like, just.  All right.  Please.  Let this go.  Shut the fuck up.  I'm asking you nicely to please stop talking because you don't understand how angry I  remember this.  And it wasn't a tough thing.  It wasn't like it was like, I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to control.  It's almost like if I understand how people get run over with their cars. 
[00:53:30]  It was like, I understand how people do that in that moment.  And I was willing to stop.  It wasn't like I wanted to bully her.  I just.  Right.  I'm done talking.  I'll stop you.  Stop.  Please.  You'd have no part of it.  And I was.  She wouldn't go back to her apartment.  Like, I was paying her rent because I didn't want us to fight like this.  And I'm like, I know that I'm a motherfucker sometimes.  And I'm like, I want her to be able to go home.  And then, like, you know, 20 blocks away she lives.  And she wouldn't leave.  Like, she wouldn't go home that night to her.  Like, and so she wouldn't leave my space.  It was like.  Whatever. 
[00:54:00]  I bet that happens.  And some of these dummies get killed and they don't realize.  You just fucking suck it up and leave.  Just leave.  You dunce.  Yeah.  Just fucking stop.  You're going to get killed.  For the moment.  Yeah.  Just stop for the moment.  But again, it's where we break up and then we don't talk for a while.  And now she's probably my best friend.  Well.  Well.  Yeah.  Girls will like that.  They can do that.  Happy ending.  Yeah.  Do we have any more of that Arius?  No.  I just put the one.  Audio.  That one.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Well.  She's.  You wonder what goes on though.  Sentencing will be.  Like in your head when the rage wears off.  Yeah.  And you just look.  And you just.  Oh man.  You just killed someone.  That's when you got to go into survival mode and you start.  You know.  You got to start cutting through some joints.  Get rid of that fucking body.  Yeah.  It is un.  Retractable.  It's unfixable.  Right.  You can't.  Like this is not fixable.  You just.  Somebody's going to ask about that person.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  And there's DNA all over the place.  And you're connected with them. 
[00:55:00]  Like that's your dude.  And there's no way you can get out of it.  You can try to make up excuses.  The cops are so good at fucking foiling that.  Especially on these.  These instant crimes of passion that happen right off the.  Without any planning.  Because.  Yeah.  Everyone knows she was over your house.  Yeah.  You got evidence.  What's the story?  Where did she go?  You were the last one to see her.  There's got to be blood evidence somewhere.  You start thinking a story.  Like oh it could have been this person. 
[00:55:30]  And you get like halfway through.  And you're like.  Oh fuck.  It comes back to me.  It comes back to me.  It doesn't work.  Like maybe your hands are injured.  How do you explain that?  You got.  It just never works.  The cops know right away.  They look at you.  They'll give you the once over.  His knuckles are a little beat up.  His eyes are dark.  And he's sweating a little bit.  Yeah.  He did it.  Now we know he did it.  Right.  Now it's just putting all the pieces together.  And getting the info.  Can I make you look like a dog attack?  Could I. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Maybe.  Maybe a whole invasion?  As a kid I used to cover up my crimes.  I would cover up my crimes.  But my crimes were pretty much.  I broke the clock in the living room.  And what I would do is.  I would then take the clock.  And once I was bending.  Bending the big hand on a clock.  Just bending it.  Why?  And it went.  It snapped off.  Because it was bendable.  And it went.  Apparently not.  It snapped off. 
[00:56:30]  I'm like.  Oh shit.  I'm going to be in so much trouble for this.  So I laid out the clock on the floor.  And I broke another piece off.  And threw it out over here and stuff.  And of course.  Who did it?  The dog.  The dog.  The dog.  Did it work?  Did it.  No.  How could the dog break the hands off the clock?  Yeah.  But I was saying it was the dog.  It was the dog.  And I never gave in.  But in your head.  It sounded like the most plausible.  Oh yeah.  As a kid. 
[00:57:00]  It's like.  Oh yeah.  The dog did it.  With his non-opposable thumb.  Yeah.  And the dog that had never touched anything that was up on that.  Right.  The clock.  Well.  Well.  That dog hated that clock.  He had it.  Yeah.  Couldn't handle that ticking.  Yes.  He hated that.  We don't have a dog.  Anthony.  That might have been a problem too.  Yeah.  Well.  The cat did it.  The kitten.  The kitten brushed against it.  Yeah.  With his two ounce body.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a fucking little bird told me. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  Be right back.  Serious.  Serious.  XS.  The O.P.  and Anthony Show.  I think this song is.  Remember the song from the Jerky Boys movie?  Jerky Boys soundtrack.  It sounds like one.  I kind of remember that.  Collective soul.  Collective soul.  Remember the Jerky Boys movie?  What the fuck was going on there? 
[00:58:00]  How awful that was.  Hey, these guys made this bootleg tape, a prank phone call.  Ah, let's get my movie.  And it wasn't even when the first or second tapes hit where it was really hot.  It was after the fourth and fifth and they were about to break up anyway.  It was in 95.  That was 95, huh?  And they got big.  Jerky Boys.  I remember them on that bootleg that went around before they edited out the names.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just got a cassette tape.  Play it over and over again. 
[00:58:30]  Real poor quality.  When did they come up?  93.  Oh, God.  I heard them way before that.  That was when the first album came out.  Album.  But the bootleg tape was around for quite a while before that.  A little jerky.  I think that was around before I did stand-up.  That's got to be in the late 80s.  They formed in 89.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I do remember like at least late 80s.  They sold 8 million CDs.  Oof.  8 million.  They probably didn't see shit out of that.  You hoped they made a good deal.  I bet they fucking got fucked. 
[00:59:00]  Artists rarely make good deals with record companies.  And it's not like they're going to tour.  Yeah, they can't.  That's where artists make so much of their money is touring and merchandise.  Like they don't.  Frank Rizzo t-shirts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I listened to Jerky Boys 2, the album, like over and over and over again.  It was very funny.  Yeah.  Just giggling in the backseat.  Just chuckle.  My mom drove me around.  Then she found out what I was listening to.  Oh.  She took the tape away from me and she hid it for years. 
[00:59:30]  Had Cobra.  Saul's warts.  Like these are hysterical.  Dirty.  Yeah, she didn't like that.  Is there a trailer for the Jerky Boys movie?  I'm sure there is.  Oh, not the trailer.  By the way, whoever writes the copy for this company.  Oh, yeah.  You fucking stink.  Yes.  You fucking job.  Yes.  You stink.  Okay.  Let's see.  All right.  The Jerky Boys movie trailer.  This is from what year again?  95.  95. 
[01:00:00]  Do you want the extended minute 30 trailer?  Yeah.  Minute 30 is fine, right?  Nice and 90 second trailer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking yeah.  What a bigger Trav.  Just a limo pulling up to a movie theater.  Oh, there he is.  And they're getting out of the limo.  Oh.  Look, show up there, barrel-ins.  They're walking in. 
[01:00:30]  Kept him in change.  To the movie?  There's a restaurant.  Yeah.  Those are the big shots from Chicago.  Hey, who's in that?  Yeah.  Big pussy in it?  See.  Pre-Sopranos.  Yeah.  So, if somebody crosses you, you just kill them?  Oh, oh, oh, little lady.  In my business, you know, we don't kill.  We whack.  Oh, oof. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, look who it is.  I can't wait to tell the girls.  I was out with a real whacker.  Oh, wow, whacker.  Gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself.  My name's Tony Scarboni.  That's great, Tony.  How about getting us a couple of drinks at the bar up there?  Mr. Scarboni is not your waiter.  He is your host.  Sir, I'll get a couple of drinks here.  This is terrible.  This is very good.  He's doing the voice.  Yeah.  It's a big pussy.  Could you turn it up a little more, please?  So, you know, voice from Chicago, right? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, that's right.  Well, maybe you can give us small timers a few pointers.  What happened?  That's the trailer?  That's the worst trailer ever.  That's not a trailer.  I don't want to see that movie.  What is that?  That's not a trailer.  Boom, boom.  I don't think that was the trailer.  Come on, Travis.  You're breaking everything.  Yeah.  Breaking everything.  There we go.  Watch out, America.  All right.  Saros front desk.  Oh, I got hemorrhoids bad.  My butt is killing me.  The Jerky Boys have got your number. 
[01:02:00]  Who am I talking to?  Frank Rizzo.  Rizzo.  Rizzo.  Rizzo.  I don't know any Frank Rizzo.  Who?  Frank Rizzo.  Open your ears, jackass.  Sometimes it's a good idea just to hang up.  How do you cure this?  What do you do?  Do you jag me?  Do you poke at me?  What, do you beat these things off with a stick?  The Jerky Boys.  The movie starts Friday, February 3rd.  Wow.  Alan Arkin was in that?  Oh, my God.  Remember when you could get away with being funny by just calling and saying,  I got hemorrhoids, my butt hurts real bad. 
[01:02:30]  Yes.  Hilarious.  I would prank call people and fucking crack everybody up.  Did you do voices?  Fuck yeah.  Like what?  Hey, I got my butt hurts.  What?  This sounds like your voice a little higher.  I'll call up and I'll go, hey, you got to press out on the can?  Oh.  And they'll go, yeah.  I'll be like, well, he's probably fucking dead.  Wow.  Fuck yeah.  That's like satanic.  It's devilish.  Fucking devilish rock and roll.  Oh.  They probably liked that guitar riff in the beginning.  Fuck yeah.  That's not what it sounded like. 
[01:03:00]  Fuck it.  They use the same jokes from the records.  They clean it up.  From the tapes.  And they're like, you know, Frank Rizzo, open your ears, Jack.  It's like, we heard that.  Somebody uploaded the movie in parts.  Oh.  And all the descriptions say, The Jerky Boys, a really funny movie with lots of swears.  Oh.  I wonder if an eight-year-old uploaded that.  I do remember they lived in Queens.  Yes.  In the movie. 
[01:03:30]  And they showed the establishing shot of their house.  And you could see the old Elmhurst tanks behind them.  That's for the older people here in the New York area.  You might remember the Elmhurst tanks.  It used to be a landmark for the traffic reports on the radio.  And stop and go traffic passing the tanks.  They're like red and white.  Big giant oil tanks.  Yeah, they're gone.  I don't even remember where they were.  It really was what the movie was all about, though.  Like, you'd sit there watching the trailer, and you'd hear the jokes from the tapes, and 
[01:04:00]  you'd be like, oh, this is going to be hilarious.  And then you'd go and see the movie, and you're like, well, it's just the jokes from the tapes.  And the tapes put in this poorly crafted story of a mob involvement with the jerky boys.  Do you think they would have made more money now because you can actually sell stuff on the internet?  Like, if YouTube and iTunes had been around when they were around?  Oh, to release the tape?  Yeah, you'd think they could have made more money than...  I don't know. 
[01:04:30]  Maybe if they just released the...  If they released on iTunes as themselves?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, like, put up YouTube videos and get some of that money, too?  Oh, this just looks horrible.  All right.  Enough of the jerky boys.  What year was this?  Kamal lived in the building next to mine for a long time.  Did he?  Yeah.  I don't know where he is now.  Oh.  Did he ever do the voice?  I live in the building next to you.  Ah!  Yeah, what is he?  A camel hurting or something?  It's a good one. 
[01:05:00]  You have all the good ones, Chippa.  We have Colin coming in.  Colin Quinn.  Still sniveling on Twitter.  What is he sniveling about now?  I unfollowed him.  Still sniveling.  Oh, he will not leave that alone.  Still sniveling.  What's wrong with him?  Like some grandmother.  And we have Martha Quinn and Alan Hunter.  Yes.  Later on, of course, they got a new book out here.  What is it?  VJ.  The Unplugged Adventures of MTV's First Wave. 
[01:05:30]  And we have Rick Shapiro.  Pictures in this?  Coming in.  No, no pictures.  No.  What?  I'm looking forward to seeing Rick.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You should definitely ask the VJs about the last time they were in here.  They thought they were doing the O&A show, except it was just Roland hosting the after  show.  Oh, boy.  And it was the worst interview that's ever happened.  How many of them were here?  Four.  Why was it the worst interview ever?  Because it was like two years ago, probably.  Oh, oh, oh.  And Roland wasn't prepared to interview him. 
[01:06:00]  And so I left, everybody left the studio, except for him and the VJs, because we wanted  to see Roland just flounder in here.  How'd that work?  And he started the interview by saying, I don't want to be here.  And they looked like.  Really?  What?  You don't.  Do we have any of that?  And then he told them to talk amongst yourselves.  What?  He goes, talk amongst yourselves.  He insulted them.  Absolutely.  And they thought they were doing O&A and like Alan Hunter had his video camera out.  He thought it was going to be like a big deal. 
[01:06:30]  And Roland was just in here floundering.  Oh, wow.  Did he bomb Roland?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was really embarrassing.  We've talked about this before.  Have we?  I don't remember that.  I don't think I was in.  There's a, you know.  I wasn't here.  I must have been out.  Yeah, I was busy.  Anthony, in fact, you say yes, I heard.  What happened?  Oh, yeah?  Bad.  So bad.  What's the show called after us?  After O&A Live?  Yes.  Usually Sam kind of takes that on.  But this week we're having guest hosts. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, I don't know why.  You're spinning this fake wheel and then like it lands on a name that you already decided on.  And what a surprise.  It was Roland.  It was Roland.  You did guess that before the show ended.  I sure did, Jimmy.  I sure did.  It was an easier guess yesterday.  I don't remember this.  Yeah, yeah.  He hosted it.  It was the worst interview that's ever been on the channel, for sure.  Wow.  Even worse than Loverboy?  Yeah, this one was more uncomfortable than Loverboy.  We hear some? 
[01:07:30]  Eric is saying he doesn't know if he has the clips.  Oh, E-Rock.  Let me see if they're in this YouTube video.  What are you doing, E-Rock?  Not bringing tissues in.  Yeah, what are you doing besides not supervising the studio stuff?  It seems like it fell out of the box.  Yeah.  We made a break for it.  Did it?  We got the tissues in a suicide attempt.  Yeah.  Damn.  No?  Nothing?  What?  I'm sorry.  I'm listening.  Oh, okay.  I don't really care. 
[01:08:00]  They're coming in, though.  Yeah, we'll get two of them.  We'll chit-chat with a little Martha Quinn.  Martha Quinn was the little girl next door looking one.  Yeah.  And everybody liked her.  Boy, were they sweet on her.  Yeah.  I was too young when, like, I didn't know who the original MTV VJs were.  Oh, yeah.  So Martha Quinn started doing proactive commercials later on.  Yes, I remember those.  And she was like, hey, I'm Martha Quinn.  And I remember as a kid watching them being like, who the fuck is Martha Quinn? 
[01:08:30]  Why is she talking to me about it?  And then I found out.  Dedicated to JJ.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Do you want to listen to some of Roland's interview?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is taken from the show where we already listened to it the first time.  So there will be some commentary over that.  Maybe we can comment on the commentary.  The original MTV VJs, Roland, just for you.  Oh.  Come on in. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, they can talk.  Come on in.  Everybody grab a mic.  Do we have to?  You want us to grab?  Come on here.  Roland, move over here.  Yeah.  Here, you can move this one.  I'll switch.  What are we doing, man?  How are you?  This is after Opie and Anthony Live, and Roland is a guest host today.  I don't want to do it.  What do you mean you don't want to do it?  Wow, perfect.  I just put the guest, and I'm off all of you.  Yeah, you got stuck with it, man?  Yeah.  It sucks.  It does suck.  I say we bail on him.  Let's talk about how sucky that is.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  I like that. 
[01:09:30]  Roland, you have legends in the studio.  Will you talk to them?  This is your show.  It's your show now.  I'll tell you what.  If you don't know everything about our past, you're fucked right now.  I grew up watching you guys, but then I blanked out, though.  Talk about it.  That's Liam.  He gets nervous.  Why don't we just interview each other on the show?  There you go.  So, Mark, what have you been up to lately?  Oh, gosh, Al.  How about you?  I'm just going to film all of this, if you don't mind.  Fill everybody in.  Tell me, have you done video for your new album? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, right.  No, we're going back.  Question number seven.  We're going retro.  Have you done video?  We're going to do stills.  24 frames per second.  It's crazy.  It's a crazy idea.  It's a second long video.  It's only a second.  I don't think I remember this.  It's not going to be a concept.  It embeds in your brain.  It's all good.  That's fine.  Take over.  Thank you, everybody.  Good night.  All right.  It's been good.  Because usually...  Ah, Sam.  Wait, that was magic, man.  No, usually Sam's supposed to post it, but he makes one of us post for this week. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, gosh.  So where are Opie and Anthony?  Are they gone?  They're on their way home right now.  Really?  They're on vacation?  No, they leave at 10 o'clock.  Oh, they're gone.  So I'm confused.  It's an urgent message.  You have to go to Opie and Anthony right now before they leave, and they hustled us down here.  Oh, I have no idea.  And we find one guy going, oh, I don't want to enjoy this.  It's kind of confusing.  No, no.  At 10 o'clock, they run home.  It's something.  It's a good one.  I'll tell you this. 
[01:11:00]  I need to just go home.  Are you going to go for it?  Yeah, this might be.  Yeah.  We're in the middle of this.  This is terrible.  They said, come on down here real quick.  But I might just get out of your hair here.  Yeah.  I think they did that.  Just torture me.  No problem.  It was good.  That was a great interview.  Thank you.  No problem.  That was the best ever.  No problem.  Good job, Michael.  Oh, thanks.  Was that it?  Yeah, they're all leaving one by one now.  Wait, that was...  Oh, my God. 
[01:11:30]  Ew.  Oh, man.  And that's your commentary over it.  Yeah.  Fuck.  That was fucking good.  No, I don't think that went very well.  Fuck, yeah.  Now, we've heard Roland on his version of his food court show.  Yeah.  And he does very well.  Oh, yeah, he does.  So what happened there?  He was not prepared.  Food court show is extremely well prepared.  Very well prepared, yes.  Oh.  So he can't wing it.  No.  Roland is not a wing it guy. 
[01:12:00]  Plus, when he panics, he loses whatever's in his brain.  Yeah.  And when he goes, oh, Sam, it's because I was walking out of the studio.  Yeah.  And so it was literally like you just look, there was an empty chair.  Huh.  And there was nobody to kind of try to deflect.  There was...  Oh, wow.  It was just Roland.  And I told Eric to leave the booth, if I remember correctly.  So you couldn't even make eye contact with everybody.  There was nobody for Roland to talk to.  Was he panicking?  Yeah.  Roland does this thing when he gets a little jumpy where every word he says flows into 
[01:12:30]  the next word.  Yeah.  It is amazing.  And a lot of times I really can't...  I can't just get on to see.  Yeah.  It was funny when you texted me the other day and you were listening.  I don't know what he's saying right now.  I don't know what he's saying.  One word goes into another.  He's coming up the hallway right now.  He looks very embarrassed that we played the interview again.  Oh, Roland.  Because they walked out one at a time.  Yeah, they did.  I think Alan Hunter was the last to leave, if I remember, because he just felt bad for it.  Roland. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  I shit the bed.  Were you nervous when they all came in?  I started sweating and then Mark Goodman just looked at me like...  Oh, really?  He wasn't happy?  Yeah.  If I won't be here, he goes, should I leave?  I'm like...  You hung us out to dry, too.  No, actually, I think it was the one who brought in those big trash cans and told him, come on  down.  O.P.  Anthony's still there.  Who's...  Who brought the trash cans?  I think Bladder.  He was like, go down there.  O.N.  is still down there.  Then there was me.  Oh, we weren't.  I know. 
[01:13:30]  Jesus Christ.  But you were like, yeah, they left.  You could have said, yeah, they're on vacation.  I got scared.  And then they were like...  I got scared.  And then they asked.  They were like, are they on vacation?  No.  No, they ran home.  No, no.  They just left at 10.  They heard it was you guys coming in.  Because that sounds like they weren't important enough for us to hang out.  Plus, they just heard from Roland, hey, man, I don't want to be here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't want to be there.  I was like, you son of a bitch left.  That was very awkward.  Sam just tapped me like this, like, everything will be okay.  And then usually I'll see him walk back, and then he just walked right out. 
[01:14:00]  Were you embarrassed?  Yeah, because I just had them all staring at me going.  Like, come on, conduct an interview.  And then that's why I said, talk amongst yourselves.  Yeah.  I was scared.  Oh, God.  He threw me under the bus.  I was like, ah.  You think they're going to remember when they come in?  I think Mark Goom still remembers that, because every time he goes, ah, he goes, I like you now.  He got out of the garage for a little while.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He wanted to squeeze my head.  They didn't like you, really, for a while? 
[01:14:30]  I think so, yeah.  I think they were humiliated.  Because they're all excited.  They walk in, and then they're like, hey.  What were they promoting at that time?  That they were on Sirius Radio.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  There's a big 80s on 8 deal.  I have been guilty.  I have been guilty of tuning that 80s on 8 in.  That's a good channel.  I've been guilty of that.  Just that and the Bruce channel I listen to.  Oh, Bruce.  Bruce.  That I don't listen to.  Oh.  I don't even listen to Bruce when it comes on the 80s channel. 
[01:15:00]  I'm just kind of like, oh, time to go to the 70s or the 90s.  Time to make the donuts right here.  Or that.  Or that.  We got rolling.  We got planned for tomorrow.  It's Friday, right?  Yeah.  Anything?  If you want something.  We had Taco Day last week.  Very good.  Hard Rock Johnny wants to bring you in food.  If you want.  That's Hard Rock food.  It's so bad.  I don't mean like bad, you know, tasting.  Like Michael Jackson bad?  Whatever it is.  But, you know.  Jody Arias bad. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Get that grilled cheese truck back.  Oh, yeah.  I can get another truck back.  It's really good.  It's a different type of food.  What comfortable?  Do you like Asian?  Sometimes.  Not in the morning.  Yeah.  Not a morning roll.  Not off a truck.  Yeah.  That might be the one food I don't want in the morning.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah.  Chinese.  Yeah.  It's delicious.  Chinese food in the morning.  Open the fridge.  Eat it.  You can do one great shit.  Do you heat it up?  Yeah.  I put like medium heat. 
[01:16:00]  And I eat the noodles and then take a massive shit.  Because it cleans you out.  Some people are.  It's like a diuretic.  Some people can just eat that shit out of the fridge without heating it up.  Like Chinese food.  I think the only thing you can really eat that's been in the fridge.  That isn't heated up.  It's like turkey.  When you have a turkey, you can just grab some fucking turkey and do that.  Or chicken sometimes.  Roast beef.  Pizza.  Roast beef.  Well, if it's.  Depends.  Sliced.  Even pizza.  No.  It's so much better heated up. 
[01:16:30]  Some things are just.  Sure, it's better.  But it's fucking disgusting not heated.  Chinese food is this coagulated mess.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Of goo and gelatinous.  Ugh.  You've got to heat up Chinese food.  That's the cockat thing.  And the rice, too.  It's fucking hard.  So you can't do that.  Spaghetti is another thing.  That's got to be heated up.  Rice isn't even good when it's heated up.  You don't like rice?  Not when it's like reheated.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because it stays like.  Rice really is a pain in the ass. 
[01:17:00]  You don't like cold spaghetti?  Cold spaghetti is awful.  Awful.  I'm not a spaghetti guy, but I've heard good things.  No.  I used to eat cold macaroni as a kid.  No.  Wow.  I would sing a song when I was going to eat it.  What?  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Please.  If we could recreate the little song you would sing.  You open up the fridge.  I would open up the fridge and I would see.  You're turning red, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I would.  How old of a lad were you at this point?  Between five and nine, I would say. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, wow.  I guess.  I can't remember like a specific age.  This drivel on for years.  Yeah.  So I would see the Tupperware of little macaroni elbows.  Oh.  I would say, cold macaroni, cold macaroni.  Yes.  Wow.  Wow.  That was really difficult.  It sure does.  And then you said, where are you going?  I can't take the cold macaroni song anymore. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Well, let's get out of here.  Yeah.  Well, it's your choice.  You could leave.  Oh, boy.  That's horrible.  So you would sing cold macaroni.  Cold macaroni.  Yeah.  And then I would sit on the couch and eat my cold macaroni.  That's pretty embarrassing.  That made us all hate you.  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be like clever, maybe.  Yeah.  Creative. 
[01:18:30]  Maybe like one word in the song that wasn't either cold or macaroni.  Or macaroni.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  That's pretty bad.  Yeah.  Cold macaroni of the elbow variety.  Cold macaroni.  Doesn't get better with more words.  Sure does.  Cold macaroni song is fucking amazing.  He's got to know what to do with it.  Yeah.  I'm no phony eating cold macaroni.  That's too heavy.  Yeah.  Cold macaroni.  If you want to heat it, got to go down to hell. 
[01:19:00]  Everything's the devil.  Back to the devil.  Yeah.  So we have a, now we only have them, because we had Colin and Rick and now we have them  at 830.  So they're only staying for a little while?  Yeah.  Because then we have their Rachel Ray.  Wait, wait.  Both of them?  Mm-hmm.  Why?  Martha and, we have Martha and Alan.  Oh, oh, I thought Colin had to leave.  No.  No, no, no, no.  Oh.  Now will you be here to awkwardly remove them from the studio?  The VJs?  Why?  Because they're experienced with you. 
[01:19:30]  I think they kind of forgot because I saw them yesterday.  I was like, hey.  They had no recollection.  What are some Alan Hunter, Martha Quinn highlights in the book?  Are there any stories that are like, oh boy, look out.  Where she interviewed police and it was uncomfortable.  The police.  Yeah.  Why?  What happened?  She actually means the real police.  Oh.  It was after the fucking head of the Nussbaum murder.  She's trying to find out what kind of music Robert Chambers liked.  She said they're very angry when they went off stage. 
[01:20:00]  And they sat down and went and talked to her.  Why?  I don't know.  I mean, she said they got seen through a water bottle and left.  Is there a story in there about Alan Hunter or one of them doing Blow with David Lee Roth or something?  I think him or Mark Goodman, one of those.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  There were some hard partying days for the VJs.  What did JJ die of?  He had a bad heart, I think.  Oh, his heart?  Awesome.  Was he the oldest of them?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's really weird when you look at those five original VJs, man. 
[01:20:30]  Like, how much, you forget how much, especially in my age group, how much of our lives were spent watching these fucking five people.  I know.  And Adam Curry was a heavy metal dude.  Well, that was later.  Adam Curry, right?  He came later.  He was later.  That was later.  He had the big fucking heavy metal hair and shit like that.  But no, these, you just watched them.  Weird.  You want to see the videos, but they'd come on and you're like, oh, look.  Oh, Martha's on now.  Oh, look.  Mark has taken over for Martha.  How much ass did these guys get, you think, in the fucking 80s? 
[01:21:00]  A lot.  I bet.  They were as big as the artists.  Without a doubt.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  They must have just done nothing but fuck girls.  And they didn't have to do anything.  Like, they were as big as the artists and they didn't have to make music.  They didn't have to tour.  They just had to go to the TV studio, introduce some videos, interview some people.  Well, you don't want to look awkward.  You want to kind of look natural.  So there is this kind of.  Oh, no. 
[01:21:30]  It's a skill.  You do need some kind of ability.  Because I was just a little jab thrown at us.  Yes.  We mean that.  Exactly.  We don't have to do nothing.  They just kind of sit there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I do what you do.  We didn't like it.  No.  I don't like your little red cheeks either.  Sam knows that he fucked up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why don't you sing that cold macaroni song?  Because I recall the audition process for MTV VJs.  And I remember years ago on Howard, Gary did an audition for it and Howard played it.  And it was one of the most embarrassing things I'd ever heard. 
[01:22:00]  Was it bad?  Yes.  Yes.  I was cringing at how bad and stuttery and just awful he was at trying to audition.  VJ.  He was trying to make...  He was doing like a news segment.  Like how they would do like...  They'd do some quick news things before they got to the videos.  Rock news and stuff.  And he was trying to do that.  And he brought up Madonna.  And tried to make it like something personal between the two of you. 
[01:22:30]  It was so bad.  It was so utterly bad.  Was this before Kurt Loder?  Was Kurt Loder there at that time for the news or no?  I'm not sure.  No, I don't think...  The VJs used to just like in between videos be like...  And, you know, The Who is opening their tour.  They would just tell a little rock news.  They'd say like Live Aid was a big breakout.  Live Aid?  Yeah, that's where they went all night.  No, Kurt Loder joined MTV in 87.  Oh, wow.  As the host of The Week in Rock.  Which I used to love. 
[01:23:00]  Why?  Because it was just...  It was just good.  It was rock news.  MTV News.  Yeah, the typewriter.  MTV News.  Do you have any video of the original old jocks we watched for a second?  Alan or Mark?  Sure, yeah.  What do you want?  I wish Mark was with them and Nina.  Mark's here all the time.  Yeah.  I just wanted them all.  I see Mark all the time.  Nina is...  She's here, too.  Yeah, she's a fan.  Doing her radio thing.  She's a maniac.  She was quite the goer back in the day, I think. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, you want some MTV News from 1983 with Alan Hunter?  83.  Let's hear what Alan had to say in 83.  I'm staying, and so should you, because it is a Tuesday morning, and I'm Alan Hunter with  you.  We're going to have a good day.  Good day.  I feel it already.  I've got a little music news to sort of start things out here.  How'd you like to get your hands on clothing that once belonged to Jimi Hendrix, John Cougar,  or Hart's Wilson sisters?  Well, if you're anywhere near Seattle during the month of June, you could at one of the  biggest rock auctions ever planned. 
[01:24:00]  That is ever planned once again, ever planned.  Three weeks from June the 3rd until June.  Wait a minute.  Three weeks.  June.  Ah, the 24th.  He's got a script in his hand.  Now, Hendrix, you got one of those.  Play video.  Shut up.  Play the music.  Zee.  Zee.  And Nancy's black satin hooded cape.  That's the item for me.  Look at that hairdo.  It's like a little mullet-y.  We're wearing red, shiny red suspenders.  First up in the music, or second up in the music news, is still the only major performer 
[01:24:30]  scheduled for Washington, D.C.'s annual July 4th concert on the Mall.  Wow.  Well, that's going to be a good time there.  Now, MTV asked the National Park Service what happened to plans to include a rock and  roll show along with Mr. Newton.  Well, we were told, quote, that was all talk.  Now, let me back up a little bit.  But back in April, it was Secretary of the Interior, that is Mr. James Watt, said no  these boys because they attract what he called a bad element.  So he said, look, we want a patriotic family show. 
[01:25:00]  Let's get Wayne Newton in there.  He said that he would even think about having a rocker as well.  But as we just told you, it was all talk.  So 500,000 people that showed up in years past ain't going to see anybody but Mr. Newton  and his pencil mustache.  Meet Lois' new album, Midnight at the Lost and Found, has just been released.  Now, if you kept up with Meet Lois, this is the third album for the man.  Max Weinberg, Rick Derringer, and also Gary Rossington and Gail Krantz playing on this album.  Meanwhile, Donny Iris and his cruisers have just finished their fourth album. 
[01:25:30]  It's called Fortune 410.  What was his big hit?  Donny Iris.  Donny Iris had a hit.  He's sitting in a barber chair, by the way.  I remember the set so well.  Noah?  Donny Iris?  The graphics were so primitive back then, too.  They're showing the concert graphics.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Next hour, like I said, we're going to have a good time today, so stay up with me. 
[01:26:00]  Love is like a rock.  Get ready for our MTV.  Love is like a rock.  That's terrible.  Triumph.  Triumph in concert.  Yeah.  Look at the big hair guy.  MTV's own minor notes features Van Halen's David Lee Roth, Billy Idol, plus a tribute to  Muddy Waters, with guests Johnny Witter, George Thorogood, and others.  If everyone looks young, what happened? 
[01:26:30]  Time.  Look at the way MTV, the address, they were talking about Wayne Newton.  He mentioned the Secretary of the Interior, and there's a tribute to Muddy Waters.  Like, they dealt with, it seems like real music, like, not real music, but they dealt with  all kinds of music.  They weren't so obsessed with talking to someone who's 15 years old.  Yeah, yeah, true.  That's the way music in general is now.  You know what I mean?  Like, they would have, they have pop artists go to the White House now, because it's all  much sort of teeny bopper, safe stuff. 
[01:27:00]  Well.  You know, there's not really that.  Oh, really?  Like, yeah, I mean, that fucking convicted criminal rappers going to the White House?  Yeah, what about that?  Perhaps.  Yeah, what about those guys?  I don't know.  I think we ought to fucking go to the conservative insurgents and see what he says about it.  Yeah, let's see what he's going to say.  Maybe we should bring back Wayne Newton then, I guess.  Dick bag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see what he's going to say.  Just trying to have a show, and all these guys are coming in and mucking up the works.  Oh, no.  God.  I didn't give that one ounce of thought after we left the studio yesterday. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, what is Martha?  Let's hear a little bit of Martha Quinn.  What year is this?  83.  82.  Look how cute.  Did she have boyfriends back then?  I'm going to have to ask her when she comes in here. 
[01:28:00]  She had boyfriends on July 14th.  And if they got all jealous for fame and the fact that every guy wanted to fucking have sex with her.  Look at the little cleavage she's showing.  She knows what she's doing.  Sexy.  I think Mark Goodman had a problem with her initially because she wasn't a seasoned broadcaster or something.  Like a radio DJ?  Yeah, because he was a radio guy, and JJ was a radio guy, and of course Nina was very good. 
[01:28:30]  But, uh, like she, yeah, he felt like, why the fuck is, you know.  He probably also didn't like that she was a cute girl, so she was getting all the attention.  You think?  Yeah.  You know, that always happens.  I don't know.  He got attention with his big afro.  It works.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You're Pat Benatar.  What a fucking prominent jaw on her.  Like a goddamn viper. 
[01:29:00]  I like these because, uh, they include the commercials and apparently a trailer for Fast Times.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Should we break real quick?  Yeah.  Yeah, Colin Cummins.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we'll take a, we'll take a break and, uh, be back.  Colin Quinn.  The inimitable Colin Quinn.  Yeah, Colin's gonna come in.  Did some whinging.  What is this?  A fucking 80s commercial for, um, what is it for? 
[01:29:30]  It's up to Defender to save them.  Defender?  Atari?  A great Atari game.  Have you played Defender?  It's almost as bad as a cold macaroni scene.  Wow.  Just keep coming.  Only from Atari.  She's better than me.  Have you played Atari today?  Wow, I remember that jingle.  Yep.  Me too.  Ridgemont High, Jeff Spicoli is one of a kind.  That was my skull.  He's best dressed.  Safest night.  Best speaker.  I know early. 
[01:30:00]  And he's got a message for the youth of America.  Hey bud, let's party.  So come to school with Jeff Spicoli.  He's barely in the movie.  I know.  This is...  For some Fast Times at Ridgemont High, where only the rules get busted.  Rated R.  You know what's so funny?  Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  All those, all the drug jokes in that.  Yeah.  You couldn't do them now in a movie?  No.  No drugs.  They get very upset.  Everybody else in that movie is probably like, what the fuck?  Oh, is this the Apple Jacks pinball machine?  Remember the cereal Apple Jacks? 
[01:30:30]  They're playing the Apple Jacks pinball machine.  Apple Jacks.  Apple Jacks.  Did you have an Apple Jacks song, you fucking fruit?  Yeah.  No, I wasn't allowed to eat Apple Jacks.  Why?  My mom was a big health nut, so we didn't...  Exactly.  Yeah, I had like Product 19 and...  Products 19?  What are you on fucking...  Some military base?  Your welfare food stamps?  No.  Product 19?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  No Apple Jacks for the little trap.  No Apple Jacks. 
[01:31:00]  You know how good Apple Jacks are?  Do you even fucking know growing up?  A's for Apple, J's for Jew.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, you poor fucker.  Yeah, we had Apple Jacks, Puffs.  Yeah.  You know, like generic.  Just Puffs.  Yeah, the ones that came in the bag.  And they weren't sweetened or anything, right?  No.  They were just puffed rice or something.  Yeah, just puffed rice.  Not like Honey Smacks.  Oh, they're like little Puff Thaddies and something, Sammy. 
[01:31:30]  Ah, good one.  No.  Fruit Loops.  No.  Didn't have that.  No.  Powdered milk.  Travis Loops.  Yeah.  That's what happens when Travis runs in a circle.  All right, let's take a break.  I got a Cialis rod.  Do you?  Yeah.  Did you take a Cialis last night?  No.  Save it for more.  How long ago?  Two days.  And you still get a rod?  Oh, God, yeah.  Why'd you take the Cialis?  Sometimes you just want to feel like a man.  You didn't have company? 
[01:32:00]  No.  Why would you do that?  I jerked off.  You took Cialis to master me?  Well, I thought I might be having company.  Holy shit.  I didn't.  Did you feel silly once you realized you weren't having company?  Yeah.  You're going to walk around with a rod?  Me and my rod just laughed at each other.  Like, oh, you.  What are you doing this time?  It's just me and you again tonight, kid.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be right back with the wonderful, lovely, and talented Colin Quinn. 
[01:32:30]  Cold macaroni.  Cold macaroni.  The Obie and Anthony show.  The Obie and Anthony show.  The Obie and Anthony show.  Let's see you next time.  Thanks for calling the Obie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you.

Fuck you.  Yeah, I just want to give a big fuck you to my girlfriend, who is jealous at every fucking thing I do. 
[01:34:00]  I can't even look a waitress in the eye without her giving me a cunty fucking attitude.  Fucking seven days a week makes me fucking miserable.  And worst of all, she's a fucking dancer.  Go fuck yourself.  Fuck you.  Hi, I just want to give a big ask you to Entertainment Weekly Radio for not hiring the masterful of primetime Sam Robertson.

[01:36:30]  I will tell you, his fucking country song is great.  You like that one?  Love it.  That's just because it's odd because he's doing country.  Yeah, exactly.  Colin Quinn is here in studio.  Good morning, guys.  Hi, Colin.  Hi.  Look at that mic.  It's like a limp in front of you.  Fix the mic.  Well, help, help, Colin.  Exactly.  And then you can pull it closer to his face instead of...  You can sit closer to the table, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go. 
[01:37:00]  Sitting back in the middle of the room.  What are you doing, Carl?  I hear you're hitting up Rachel Ray after this.  Yeah.  I got to head over to Rachel Ray after this.  Yeah?  Some promos and stuff.  Promoting?  Promoting the new...  Yeah, promoting the new...  The new...  The new...  Yes, yes.  Now, you've got a whole new...  It's finally up.  ...whole new gig going for yourself.  Yeah.  And what's this one based on...  This one's the one that...  Based on what you saw, Anthony, early on.  I did.  I saw it over there.  Anthony came early. 
[01:37:30]  Almost a year ago.  Yeah.  Wow, that was that long ago?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Took you that long to put a Constitution show together?  I would have had this together two, three weeks.  Yeah, right.  Tell me about it.  Yeah, it was very funny.  And that was early on.  You'll like it now.  Yeah?  Where can I see this, Carl?  Oh, the Barrow Street Theater.  Yeah?  Theater.  Yes.  You spelled it wrong.  They spelled it T-R-E.  Barrow Street Theater with T-R-E at the end. 
[01:38:00]  Dot com.  No, I take it.  You spell it both ways.  Oh, all right.  Maybe that's like the English spelling or something.  Theater-y.  Yeah.  It's only a block around from the corner from the cellar.  I'm going head-to-head with the cellar.  I told you the other night, Jimmy.  Yeah, I know.  Taking down the cellar.  Yep.  It's been empty every night.  I performed with two people, and they were both waitresses.  I'm like, where is everybody?  Like, you know what's going on around the corner, aren't you?  Yeah.  Carl.  Yeah.  So what are you going to do with this?  You're doing five weeks of previews at the Barrow Street Theater.  Then where do you go after that?  Are you going abroad with it?  I don't think so. 
[01:38:30]  No.  No.  On the road?  I don't know yet.  It's really all kind of happened very suddenly.  It's been a whirlwind.  Are we getting a...  Are we getting another multimedia experience?  Well, it's kind of hard to say.  It's in preview, so it's kind of, you know.  Yeah.  You don't know much about this call.  No, I don't.  Well, I didn't expect these kinds of questions.  You guys are really...  We are really...  You guys are really zeroing in, and it's starting to annoy me.  We are drilling you here.  So when I come in, you trash unconstitutional, you trash the fact that was going on with Rachel  Ray, and then we move on to trashing other people that we know. 
[01:39:00]  I think we hit a couple of hot topics on the news.  That's it.  A little veiled racist trashing.  Veiled?  No.  Exactly.  I hate how veiled racism sounds.  It's phony.  I like being authentic.  I like saying the word veiled.  Yes, that is true.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, of course.  I'm very happy for you, Colin.  And...  How come no Wednesday shows?  Now we'll get to it.  Jesus Christ!  I don't know what I'm saying. 
[01:39:30]  Is that like the theater day off or something?  No, that's what you do, too.  No, I don't know.  It's actually not a bad question.  That's what's so annoying about it.  You're supposed to do matinees on Wednesday.  Oh, right, right, right.  No, I'm not in the village.  I'm doing matinees on the weekend, if you'd like to stop by.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Saturday and Sunday.  Yeah.  I mean, it's convenient.  You're in the village.  You're out having a nice afternoon with the family, walking around, doing a little shopping.  You're like, oh, let's catch a show before we head back to the path train station.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, that just takes up your whole life for the entire length of when you do this, doesn't 
[01:40:00]  it?  Yeah.  It's all encompassing.  Yes, it is.  No time for yourself.  There's no me time.  You're right about that.  No you time.  Guess what?  I don't want it right now anyway, but this weather we've been having.  Oh, let's talk about the weather.  What a great segue.  And I tell you, this was the April showers.  That may be right.  Yeah, it's like God pissing on you, right, Carl?  Oh, well.  I guess that's one way to look at it.  Fuck.  Chipper.  I don't like these late to arrive springs and summers.  It makes the summer go by too fast. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, no.  He's serious.  That's what's going to do.  By the time.  Shut up, Anthony.  By the time it gets nice, it's already almost September.  And you know, somehow the weather knows when Labor Day is, because right after that, the  temperature plummets.  He's got a point.  I do have a point.  Yeah.  Well, I have opened the pool, so that's like the official start of summer, but I haven't  even been able to use it, because it's been too, a little too chilly.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  Big bashes.  Although I'm kind of glad.  I'm very pensive about the summer, the summer, getting the pool open, because that's the 
[01:41:00]  real true test of whether I can uphold this little dry streak.  Come on.  You know, I made it through, you know, my birthday weekend, things like that, parties,  you know, stuff like that.  But boy, when the pool is open, it's hot out, you're out in the summer, oh, it could be a  little difficult.  Yeah, you'll have iced tea.  It's fine.  Yeah.  Hey, this is great iced tea. 
[01:41:30]  You think Jim's going to display his new beach body at your pool?  I hope so.  I've been over there every weekend just standing there looking at the tarp on top of it with  no shirt on.  Jim's going to get all inked up before the thing.  He's got like six tattoos, huh, girls?  Oh, Jim, have you ever thought of that?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  I want to get Zappa libs.  Holy shit.  That's a good one.  Have you ever thought of it?  You're getting a Yosemite Sam on your ankle.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Doesn't that mean gay? 
[01:42:00]  No, what?  Yosemite Sam on your ankle?  No, I thought, like, was it Yosemite Sam?  Or what cartoon character represented Hi, I'm gay?  I think it's Sweetie Byrne.  Well, yeah, well, depends on the way you have it.  On the head of your cock.  I don't know.  Cartoon character, gay tattoo.  Okay.  What is it?  Trav?  I'm looking.  Travis?  I thought it was, maybe someone knows.  They're saying Porky Pig.  So why do you want to do this, Travis?  Pepe Le Pew, Woody Woodpecker?  No.  I don't know.  I can't sleep nights. 
[01:42:30]  I don't know.  Fuck it.  So yeah, no.  I have no tattoo.  No tattoo.  No, no inclination.  You haven't even thought about it.  No way.  What if your body gets into a fucking nice shape?  What if?  When it does.  Oh, oh, when it does.  When it does.  Yeah, yeah.  When I'm totally buff, I will not be into it.  I can't wait to have Jimmy over in the jacuzzi, though.  It's always a fun, fun evening.  Yeah.  When Jimmy comes over and hops in the jacuzzi.  And then yells at me because it's not warm enough form.  The temperature of the jacuzzi fluctuates.  A lukewarm jacuzzi is better off than a fire hydrant. 
[01:43:00]  It is terrible.  If you're going to do it, do it, Anthony.  It's upsetting.  I know.  No, I finally figured it all out.  What was wrong with it?  The heater.  I didn't have the settings right on the fucking heater.  But now it's fucking, it's perfect.  But again, it's going to be hard to not imbibe in the vodka, vodka, cranberry, little ice drink.  How long has it been a month?  Something like that?  Oh, my God.  It's probably been a month.  What's that?  A month.  Not drinking.  Oh, my God.  I just pulled a chip.  What's that?  Very hard.  What's that?  It's been a month.  It's great. 
[01:43:30]  Sometimes it's difficult.  Right now, I could get away with not drinking.  How do you feel in the morning when you wake up, Anthony?  Oh, it's a wonderful new experience for me, Carl.  I'll tell you.  That morning, when you wake up and it's not a pounding headache, don't feel queasy.  Nobody's mad.  You don't know what you said the night before.  Right.  I'm not driving in still.  Perhaps if I get pulled over, there might be a problem kind of a thing.  Oh, wow.  Ah, well.  Yeah, sure.  Anthony's not a bad drunk.  He's not a violent drunk.  No, I'm the most fun drunk ever. 
[01:44:00]  Slightly repetitive.  Well, the important thing is you're doing it on your own with your own willpower.  Anyway, I can't believe you didn't have a jacuzzi.  That's such a Long Island move to get that jacuzzi.  You know, when I was 19, my friend hooked me up with this girl.  She had a TR7.  She was very, very pretty.  And she had a TR7.  And then I was like, oh, my God.  She was rich.  She lived in Lloyd Harbor.  Oh, yes.  Nice.  Nice.  Nobody even knows where that is in Long Island.  Billy Joel lived there.  Ah, exactly. 
[01:44:30]  Everyone knows that.  And we actually fooled around in her family's jacuzzi.  Wow.  And then I was a drunken idiot.  I just abused her afterwards and walked away.  It's like an 80s party movie.  I partied her.  Yeah.  And then I saw my friend.  I was like, hey, get out of here.  Meanwhile, she was like the best thing that could have happened in my life.  What's wrong with you?  And then my friend, I just go up to him.  I go, hey, man.  And the next time I saw him, I'm like, sorry.  And he just walked away and would never talk to me again as long as I left.  He never spoke to you?  Just because, not even out of feelings for the girl, just out of how could you blow the 
[01:45:00]  most amazing shot I gave you?  You fucked it up.  Yeah.  Was she pretty?  Oh, really pretty.  You fuck her?  Whoa.  It was the 80s, of course.  That's all people did.  Yeah.  It wasn't like that then, Jimmy.  You banged her in the jacuzzi or no?  No, I would never do that.  That's grotesque.  I couldn't.  I wouldn't.  I don't like jacuzzi water on my dick.  I can't keep a fucking rod in the pool.  You got to get out of it.  You got to kind of hang out.  It's good if they're bent over the edge of the jacuzzi. 
[01:45:30]  Jeez, this conversation is getting crazy.  Yeah.  It's getting a little blue.  Yeah, this will be called Morning Edge.  We're changing the name of the show to the Morning Edge.  It really is.  Yeah, we're bringing it edgy.  Pools are not really too conducive to sex.  No.  Like, it sounds like a good idea.  It plays well in movies.  But the truth of the matter is, the lubricant gets all fucked up.  You know, pool water.  You put lubricant in the pool?  I'm not coming to this jacuzzi.  No, no.  I'm talking about natural.  Natural lubricant.  Natural lubricant. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  You know how it is when it gets all sloppy down there.  Oh, boy.  This won't be like this on Rachael Ray.  Oh, you better believe it.  Oh, I want to talk about that.  She's really sexy, actually.  I remember once I was really sexually attracted to her.  I could not believe how sexy her vibe was.  She's got kind of a motherly thing around her.  Dude, she's fucking...  She's probably such a dirty bang.  You know Veronica Mosey?  Yeah.  She's funny.  So she goes one time...  Rachael Ray, she goes...  She... 
[01:46:30]  Of course, like any of the community, hates everything.  She's just talking about Rachael Ray.  She goes, she's the kind of girl who looks like she just banged the whole frat,  and now she's cooking breakfast for the next morning.  And she's just acting it out.  Wow, you know what?  Those girls never got respect, even for cooking, if they would bang a bunch of guys,  and then they would be nice enough to, like, want to do something.  Yeah.  No good deed goes unpunished.  Right, right.  I do remember...  The ideal person, and everyone's like, ugh, yeah, we were right. 
[01:47:00]  I do recall a girl up in, I believe we were in...  Suni Oneonta.  Well, you know what?  You're close, because it was Kingston, New York.  Oh, yeah.  I know Kingston, yeah.  We were playing the wonderful Augie's Checkered Flag Lounge.  Oh, where's Kingston?  How far is it?  Kingston's...  Two hours.  A couple hours.  As the crow flies.  It's nothing.  Yes.  We were playing the wonderful...  Straight shot, right up 17.  Augie's Checkered Flag Lounge.  We were staying at the Costello Motor Court, which was nearby. 
[01:47:30]  No pool, of course.  Easy.  No pool, no.  And we wound up bringing a couple of girls home, back to Costello.  And, of course, you know what transpired?  Oh, boy.  More fun and shenanigans than hijacking.  Hey, don't leave that part out.  I know.  Oh, boy.  Well, she decided the next morning, she got up early, and she wound up getting, like,  everybody some egg sandwiches from the deli.  Nice.  Nice girl.  And brought it back, and she was like, well, I gotta go, but here you go.  Thanks, guys. 
[01:48:00]  We just took them all and, like, threw them around the hotel room, smashed them all the  wall, laughed at it, stuck on the wall and stuff.  Because, like, why would I eat that fucking whore's sandwich?  Fuck her.  And it's like, and everyone, yeah, yeah.  Meanwhile, you're just a bunch of assholes.  What, are you hungry?  Of course you're hungry, but you're not going to eat some sluts fucking egg, which you rub  it on a fucking pussy, you know?  This is fucking, you don't do that.  You're just such an asshole at that age.  Did you ever see her again?  No.  Did you ever see her again? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that girl is my wife.  We went to a year later.  Yes.  How was that sandwich?  Yes.  Because I'd like to apologize to you.  Yes.  What happened to the egg whore?  Threw her out for your egg sandwich slut.  The general double standard in our sexual society.  Yeah.  The guys are stupid in front of other, they're friends, you know.  I'm sure if it was just a one-on-one experience, you'd be like, thank you so much.  You're so sweet.  But, you know, one other guy in the room, and you've got to act like, you know. 
[01:49:00]  Like the Castro brothers.  Right.  Like the Castro brothers.  Yeah, we were just talking about that before.  How did they act like those brothers didn't know what was going on?  They had to.  I don't know, man.  How are Puerto Rican brothers?  They're tight, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But the girls said that they had never seen them there.  Really?  No, the girls didn't see anybody.  How about the cops walking into a house that literally looked like Silence of the Lambs?  Yeah.  Just upstairs, and they're like, okay, what's in the basement?  Ah, the boiler, you don't want to see. 
[01:49:30]  I don't know, I don't see.  Yeah, all right, fuck it.  Yeah.  Well, I got a card right here.  Miss Littman?  Miss Littman?  Hey, where's she?  Fuck it.  Unbelievable.  They walk in the street.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Were they in the house at all?  The cops?  Yeah, they were called like 20 times to the house over 10 years.  They didn't go in, though.  They went in a couple of times.  Yeah.  I wrote a report on the internet.  Oh.  So they went in a couple of times.  Oh.  It's got to be authentic.  Yeah, they, you know.  You should have heard some of the comments. 
[01:50:00]  They were teed off.  Were they?  Teed off, yes.  Yeah, how they walked in there and, you know, just got disturbance calls.  And I guess somebody called because a girl holding a child knocked on a window once.  Right.  And the cops said, oh, it was a prank.  Right.  You know, all this shit.  Somebody else had a leash and a chain in the yard.  Yeah.  Naked in the yard.  A chain.  But then they came back.  But in that neighborhood, too, you know.  First of all, the cops did a lousy job.  But do you know how many fucking dumb calls they probably get in the neighborhood every day?  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  But if it's the neighborhood that fucking three girls disappeared from, perhaps.  Right.  Well, it wasn't in the neighborhood, was it?  It'd be a little more attentive.  Yeah, it was like five miles away.  Yeah, it wasn't all that far.  You should know, Jimmy, you're the king of Cleveland.  Yeah.  Cleveland does adore me.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I liked going to Cleveland for the gigs.  Yeah.  The city itself leaves a little.  And the women.  I do like the women in Cleveland.  Oh, lovely.  They're good girls.  Boston girls, too.  Philly girls can fucking go jump in the lake.  Whoa.  You don't like the Philly girl?  No.  They can kick rocks, in your opinion.  Yeah, they really can.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Fucking beat it.  Fucking lead me on.  Why?  I mean, they're the worst cock teasers alive.  Jim, I almost feel like you're taking one example isolated over the past 15 years, and  she represents all Philly girls.  I have about 1,600 names I can give you.  It's going to one.  Yeah, what's going on over there?  It's going to one.  What's going on?  You want some water?  Jim went to blowjob.  Yeah, you want some water?  Blowjob.  Blowjob?  I'm not freaking blowing you.  They're all full of shit. 
[01:51:30]  Anyway, from Philly to D.C., they're just fucking phony.  Yeah.  They've never gotten anything good in, like, D.C. or anything?  This is promises and bullshit.  This is like the monologue, the internal monologue of one of those serial killer truckers.  Anyway, from Philly to D.C., the cops start to notice the geographical profile.  They're like, hey, right off 95, between Philly and D.C., there's been five murders.  They've nicknamed it the Jets strip.  Yeah, with their tongues cut out, so they can never make another false promise. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, promises, promises.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's the worst.  Strawberries and...  Oh, my God.  He eats like he's in fucking Rome.  Right.  He needs like, you know...  He's like one of those baby king, you know, like the third...  Yeah, like the baby king of Nero or something.  Yeah, he's very healthy.  I heard his advice show yesterday.  I was driving home.  He was just saying, guys, without diet, it's all BS.  That's exactly what he did say.  So annoying.  Someone was calling saying that they do exercise and whatnot, but they're not losing as much 
[01:52:30]  weight as they wanted to.  And Jimmy said, it's not about the exercise.  It's about the diet.  That's most of it.  Yeah.  That really is.  That's a breakthrough thought anyway, but...  It really is.  Well, you know, Carl, I didn't have to be original.  I just had to give this young man some advice.  He said to me, how do you...  I want to know how you do it.  How do you do it, Rube?  You know, Jerry, a lot of people say, well, you're living proof that you're human.  In fact, more so.  More so.  You know, well, you know, you're famous.  I guess you just got to, you know, deal with it. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  I just love that.  That's okay, because I'm going to be twice as famous as you.  You know, twice as many...  How funny was...  How funny was Jerry Langford in that movie?  Oh, I loved Langford.  Irritated.  Oh.  So was Hitler.  I like to look at all those movies of guys that, like, really...  Because I heard he was like, what am I doing this movie?  What is this now?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The same with, like, Burt Reynolds with Boogie Nights.  Yeah, Burt Reynolds with Boogie Nights.  Yeah, fight his agent, and he ended up winning an Academy Award.  Or, like, the guys who were older that didn't know what they were doing, but they went in  and were brilliant.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, Burt Reynolds with Boogie Nights. 
[01:53:30]  I'd rather...  You know, how about we do another Smoking Bandit?  Right.  That went good.  How about another Hooper?  I guess it just goes to show that you can be a consummate professional.  Well, that's how good those guys are.  Yes.  Even though they're resisting, they show up on the set every day and do their job.  We had Mark Wahlberg in, and he said that Burt Reynolds started doing the dialogue with  an Irish accent the first day, because he thought it was supposed to be the guy with  an Irish accent.  What?  And they had to tell him...  Did they just tell him, look, first?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  This is not what you're supposed to be doing.  Stop it.  Ugh.  Fucking do the...  Read the lines like they're supposed to be read. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  This big toupee.  He did have a giant toupee in that movie.  You know, you posted something about you and Conan having a beef, and it was this  fighting Irish family.  Oh, yeah.  The Joyces and the...  And I wound up watching all these documentaries on these bare-knuckle brawlers in Ireland.  They're pretty fucking interesting, man.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah?  All they do is fight over some slight...  The Irish.  Well, no, they're tinkers.  They're like gypsies.  And you read the comments in the court, because it was like, I'd meet you in Longford.  Now, you never showed up, Joe.  Have it? 
[01:54:30]  And they just keep arguing, and then they beat the balls off each other.  Really?  But then the comments, you can tell they're the most hated people in Ireland, because  underneath, it's like, they're useless cunts.  Hitler was right about killing gypsies.  You should kill every fucking one.  They do nothing.  They had nothing to society.  And it's like all these great comments, but just totally Irish written so well, but just  like a comment that you're cursing and like literate.  Just trash.  Really?  Everybody hates their guts.  So they hate each other, and everybody hates them.  Everybody hates them.  Why do they, like, why are they doing this? 
[01:55:00]  No, they've been doing that for hundreds of years to settle inter-family beefs.  They have two guys, you know, the Joyce, Quinn, McDonough, and there's all these different  families, and they just have these big beefs, and some of them are really funny guys, you  know, but you can barely understand them.  What is that about the Irish?  Why do they hate each other?  And a lot of them, honestly, a lot of them, and I'm not just saying this to be inclusive  to our fill-in for Opie today, but a lot of them do look like Scorch.  Really?  Yes. 
[01:55:30]  Do they?  Yeah, facially.  Do they have a facial?  Look, I'm like, there's just something about them.  This one guy was talking about how he keeps his fucking hands hard.  He goes, I soaked him in-  That's Joe Joyce, yeah.  Joe Joyce.  I soaked him in petrol for 20 minutes a day.  Yeah.  He soaked his hands in gas for 20 minutes a day.  It's not even gas, petrol.  You know, it's like-  Petrol.  He's a European knock-off shit, probably.  Yeah, very low-octane.  Very high in fucking additives.  That's a fight.  His wife must have hated when his big fucking hard rock hands went into her pussy. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, just burns her pussy?  Yeah.  They don't finger each other in Ireland.  They just have regular sex.  Regular missionary position to have kids.  Yeah.  I remember a friend of mine, it was a little kid, went to Ireland, and he was like trying  to visit his relatives.  He came back and told us how we had to have these fights with all these little kids from  this trailer.  And he started describing tinkers, but we didn't know what it was.  You know what I mean?  Oh, shit.  So it's like one of those things, they're like, hey, Yank, come on, Yank, and they made  him fight every day.  And it was the same thing.  They made one of a vacation. 
[01:56:30]  Just getting fucking the shit beat out of you.  That sounds horrible.  He was a wild kid anyway, so I'm kidding.  Was he?  Oh, okay.  It does seem like if you go to Ireland, you're probably going to get in a fight.  Because they like to mix it up.  Well, if you're in the bar the whole time, obviously something's going to happen.  Like the Donnybrook.  I always see, fuck, every piece of footage of Ireland, I see it's fucking dismal out.  The weather is cloudy.  I have zero desire to go there.  Like today.  Yeah, here in our own home.  Oh, yes.  Well, I'm surprised that Jim is like a sunny day enthusiast.  He's like, I don't want to go to that dismal weather. 
[01:57:00]  Jim is.  He smiles when he sees sunshine.  God damn, I didn't realize he was a fucking Brazilian supermodel.  I get the doldrums from some of that weather.  What the fuck is this?  You know, go out before it's dark, do you?  An irrespectable comedian.  I just don't care for overcast weather.  It really dampens my mood.  I don't blame you.  Yeah, people, they put those fucking lights on themselves.  They look into a fucking light all winter long because they get seasonal depression. 
[01:57:30]  I have seen.  So they have to look into a light.  I think I think our own Troy Kwan right there.  He has one.  Yeah.  And it's so you your body and your eyes can see some type of what would be sunlight.  I'm worried about all the other shit.  You worry about this.  What about pesticides?  I don't pour water on my strawberries.  Pour it as water all over your strawberries.  Only because I knew if I reached for your coffee, which I wanted to do and smashed it,  you would have caught me too early. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  I had to go with what was available to my hands.  Now Jim's moving his items away from me.  Well, I told you, this creep started it many years ago.  I was trying to have a lovely cup of tea at the Comedy Cellar, as I like to have.  And so they go upstairs and I was like, oh, they gave me mint tea instead of regular  tea.  You know, I fucking I don't like mint tea.  Turns to turns out to be they gave me regular tea.  It was not the staff swallowing.  I want to emphasize that.  This asshole was chewing gum and stuck his gum in my fucking tea. 
[01:58:30]  I was drinking his goddamn gum, his gum juice.  Holy shit.  You thought it was mint tea.  I was like, oh, mint tea.  I don't like this.  Minty fresh.  He's sitting there smoking at the table.  So ever since then, anytime he's at the table.  I got you twice.  Yeah.  And that was 10 years ago.  Yeah.  And ever since then, literally, if he's at the table, even all these years later, you  think somebody's a mature adult.  I carry my tea, any drink, any beverage I have, I carry him down with me.  Well, you should. 
[01:59:00]  Yes.  He's going to fucking pervert it in some fashion.  Wow.  Now, were you grossed out with the thought?  You know, just one of those things.  It was just infuriating.  It's in his mouth and, you know.  No, Anthony, you know what it is.  You just, you like certain comforts.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all you're saying.  What can we look forward to in your unconstitutional?  Well, you're the only one that really understands what I'm trying to achieve.  I love it.  Oh, I know what you're trying to achieve.  I love it.  No, you don't, Jim. 
[01:59:30]  Maybe you meant me.  What's that?  Maybe you meant that I'm the only one who understands that.  No, I meant Anthony's the only one.  Of course.  What do you think he's trying to achieve?  Let's do a test.  What is he trying to achieve?  What do you think Tom is trying to achieve?  He is trying to rid the world of this ignorance and revisionist history that is going on and  using humor to get these points across instead of the doldrums of C-SPAN.  Thanks.  Of course.  What do you think, Jim?  That's very interesting.  He's trying to do some fucking fun jokes.  Oh, I told you about that idiot voice that time. 
[02:00:00]  Back in the early 90s.  I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again until the whole country understands.  Voice just hated me.  Because all these guys knew I was funny and voice didn't get.  And he would get.  So one time I was on stage at Caroline's and I did something.  But it was like almost like I go.  This is like a poem, but it was like a comedy, but it wasn't a poem.  It was jokes, but it didn't work.  He comes up right after me.  1994 goes, I don't.  We didn't know each other barely.  Just a little bit.  Hey, I don't do poems.  I do fucking jokes, folks. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Just sold me out.  Did you fucking hate him right then and there?  I was like, who is this goddamn fucking mullet bastard?  No, rat tail.  He had a rat tail.  Yeah, rat tail.  Well, rat tails were big in 94.  Yeah.  Well, maybe not big, but they were.  What the fuck?  Why would he say that?  Son of a bitch.  Especially not knowing you.  Yeah.  I mean, he knew me a little bit, but, you know.  Not that well.  Just because he was feeling so to his income.  You know, it was like it was like Voss is the one that broke it open in many ways for 
[02:01:00]  Norton and the rest of the Jersey Hacks to actually work in New York.  Jersey Hacks.  In that sense.  Yeah.  I have to give credit.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Bring in the Jersey Hacks.  Yeah.  I think Voss got there first.  We went around the same time, though.  Yeah.  Now, I remember it very vividly.  It was Voss.  Voss.  Lewis loved Voss.  He did.  Voss probably got you in.  But I used to go to the comic strip and me, you franchisee, Florentine and Eric McMahon  would go out.  Right.  To eat at that place from the strip. 
[02:01:30]  So that's fucking like 1995.  Jeez.  A million years ago, right?  A million years ago, guys.  You used to call me Naughty Norton.  Oh.  Hello, Naughty.  Yeah.  Of course you were Naughty.  I was a Naughty boy.  I was a Naughty boy.  Yeah.  And you lived with Jim at the time?  I think that's before I lived with Jim.  I spoke to Battling Bob Levy.  I'm walking on 46.  Here's the problem with the world.  I'm walking on 46th Street yesterday, going to an important publicity lunch at Joe Allen, 
[02:02:00]  top trendy restaurant with the AP.  And I passed this theater on 46th Street.  And I said, there's a bunch of shows over there.  And I look, and it says, appearing only tonight in one of the theater shows.  Bob, the Reverend Bob Levy.  Wow.  So I took a picture and sent it out.  So the public knew what was going on on the Broadway.  For one night only.  In a great white way.  Bob Levy.  Yeah.  He's like a Broadway name now.  Yeah, right.  Wow.  For one night only.  Kyle, I got to ask you, what's your take on this? 
[02:02:30]  The Constitution in this day and age.  A lot of people saying it's being trotted upon.  Well, that's that's I really I honestly I feel like I feel like we should be having more  constitutional conventions so that people can really discuss this kind of thing.  I feel like it's not a serious discussion.  It's not.  It's just everybody putting their everybody just saying this, this, this, picking and choosing.  Everyone's like, yeah, you need to have a serious conversation.  And they're like, well, let's face it.  The only thing you care about is the gut is the second. 
[02:03:00]  Well, I kind of like the first to.  Now, you care about the second.  I like the second.  But why do you care about the first?  Well, that's what I do.  It's kind of my job.  I'm saying who's trying on the First Amendment.  There are a lot of things that I trot on my First Amendment rights, especially political  correctness, more so than.  Oh, infuriating.  To not have the ability to address especially racial issues in this country without having  the scarlet R put on your chest is a fucking embarrassment.  I'm tired of black people being called racist for addressing white issues. 
[02:03:30]  I agree with you.  Oh, unbelievable.  It really is infuriating.  I would really like to have more of a freedom to say things and have an open dialogue because  nothing gets accomplished unless you can really hash it out like that.  But they're so afraid to just have an open discussion about race in this country.  Well, that's actually addressed very deeply in the show.  Good.  I got to see it.  It's almost like you're quoting the show in many ways.  Wow.  Do you address the fact that with the...  I was actually going to use scarlet R. 
[02:04:00]  I have it written down, but now I'm afraid because...  Scarlet R.  We're not.  Because I feel like I...  The scarlet letter.  Don't even feel...  Instead of an A, it's an R.  Don't even feel that way.  You take it.  Yeah, Hester Prynne.  Oh.  Somebody's doing a little reading on the old stem master.  Now, do you mention the fact that in the Constitution, everybody complains like when you mentioned  the guns.  Right.  And you say something about, well, when the Constitution was drafted, they didn't have 
[02:04:30]  fucking AR-15s or whatever it is they have.  It was a different time.  Well, I certainly don't want to mention that because that would be, you know...  And they say, well, different time.  They still meant the same thing.  But if you say, how can you listen to people who wrote the Constitution because they had slaves  and they were talking about freedom, these same people go, ah, it was a different time.  You have to allow that.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  I see it as there are certain things that you have to look at when they were keeping  rights from people. 
[02:05:00]  That is what is considered wrong.  Right.  When they're respecting rights, because rights aren't given.  They're just...  They're there.  They're your God-given rights.  And when they're respecting those rights, that's a good thing.  So with the Second Amendment, they're respecting your right to bear arms.  As of being slave owners, they are taking away someone's rights.  So you can make that distinction, Jim.  They're not the same thing that you're really talking about.  But it's the overall point and the view of how we say that was the times.  Well, so we throw the entire document away because they were slave owners? 
[02:05:30]  Is that smart?  I mean, it's strawberry.  It's got a very constitutional mustache made out of a napkin, Carl.  You're looking very...  Very...  Come on.  Very constitutional.  The Constitution.  Yeah, but that's...  This little argument, this little...  Whatever this was here, is exactly why the show...  Now it's more important now than ever.  If you see one show this year...  And when I say now, I only mean five weeks.  Right. 
[02:06:00]  Because despite Jim's plans for me to tour all over the goddamn country...  Right, he has you everywhere.  I'm sick of this thing.  I've been doing it in a year.  Great.  Five weeks and I want to fucking shoot it, make some goddamn money, get the fuck out.  Well, I want to go see it.  You know, I have to make one more comment about that, because a lot of people do bring  up the, well, it was muskets back then.  They would never, you know, have it with assault rifles and whatnot.  Do you think when they wrote the Second Amendment and said you have the right to bear arms, that  they weren't talking about the absolute top-of-the-line weaponry of their day, the musket? 
[02:06:30]  They didn't say, well, you have the right to bear this.  It's not as good as our amazing assault musket.  But, so as time went on, you got better weaponry.  And during the course of their own lives, they saw weaponry advance leaps and bounds.  You thought they thought it was just going to stop right there?  They knew it was going to advance.  Firstly, I don't think they saw the way society would degenerate at the school shootings.  I don't believe they saw that coming.  From what they've seen all over the globe back then? 
[02:07:00]  But, regardless of what they thought at that point, this is where we are now.  Right.  And we have to look at things and how they're affecting us now.  And the point I'm making is simply, people are, and this is all of us, are selective when  they look at something like, well, that was the times.  Like, we say that at certain times when it suits the argument.  But to say that that was the times when they wrote about muskets, it's like, well, they  meant it to continue.  Well, then, given that that's what the times was, so we can move along.  Well, that's what the times was.  Anyway, that's all he wants. 
[02:07:30]  That really is all I want.  That's all he wants.  All he wants you to do is go, hey, you know what, that's an interesting point.  Jim, what an interesting point.  And I got to agree with you on that one.  Look, this is not about, this is about states' rights versus federal rights.  Thank you, yes.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Yes.  And the show covers it.  Don't worry about it.  Okay, good.  I'm sitting here going, guys, just come to see the show.  Then you can really make your arguments.  Yes, yes.  And you'll be informed.  Oh, you'll be totally informed.  Yeah.  I don't like New York state's rights.  I don't like what they've done with the Second Amendment as far as that goes. 
[02:08:00]  But they're overstepping their bounds.  But it is their stupid right.  It's their right.  Well, they're right.  The state's rights are limited by the Constitution.  So I think they're overstepping their boundaries in some respects as far as the Second Amendment  goes.  I really do.  Second, you mean Bloomberg?  Yeah.  And I think also that they're putting legislation in place that does nothing.  That whole, when they said, when Cuomo wrote into law that you have to have a magazine with  seven rounds capacity, seven rounds, seven bullets. 
[02:08:30]  Didn't he do enough research to know that they don't make seven round mags for AR-15s and  for a lot of handguns and stuff?  That there's only a five and then a ten round magazine?  So then they're like, okay, we fucked that up.  We didn't even know about magazines when we wrote a law, a fucking law about it.  But now we're allowed to use the ten rounds.  We'll leave you that.  But you can only put in seven bullets.  What is that doing to protect anybody? 
[02:09:00]  Because obviously, if somebody wants to do bodily harm to someone and adhere to the ten  round magazine, they're certainly not going to adhere to the seven round limit in the ten  round magazine.  Meanwhile, I'm there loading seven rounds into a ten round mag because I want to, you  know, adhere to the rules.  Now I punish you.  Hopefully you're preparing lunch.  But it really does go because now I'm guaranteed to be outgunned in at least the number of rounds 
[02:09:30]  I have available to protect myself.  Are you sure that muskets were the most powerful weapon back then?  I was always wondering.  I feel like it would have just said muskets because we're too lazy to Google it.  Well, there were cannons.  No, but I mean handguns.  I think handguns.  Yeah, there were handguns.  They were like flintlock handguns.  But, you know, nothing that really overstepped the musket to the point where it's like, well,  we certainly don't want people having that.  What do you use?  The Gatling gun invented.  That was the 1800s. 
[02:10:00]  Early 1800s.  Those are fun.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  And we got, of course.  Is Martha here or no?  Is Martha here yet?  Oh, it's the way.  Well, we got Alan Hunter and Martha Quinn will be joining us.  Excuse me.  We have to take a break?  Yeah.  Yes.  Is Jim intimately acquainted with Martha Quinn?  Is Martha here?  No, I just looked out the window.  Stop.  You don't know.  I'll call her Miss Quinn.  Martha.  She's in the back.  What's she doing?  Oh, man.  A deuce?  She's staying alone?  It's kind of hot, actually. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  We don't have to go.  We'll do that.  Wait, now, let me ask you a question, because this is a big question for me, and it caused  a lot of contention last night.  Where the fuck do you guys expect me to sit when all these other people are coming in?  Right where you are.  I'm leaving.  No.  Stay where you are.  Don't leave.  Stay there.  Every time I try to move to the other thing, and it caused a lot of problems last week,  you guys were here with Opie, Bill Burr, and Mark Cuban.  So don't move.  Don't move.  I don't want to be rude to the new guests.  No, no.  I want you to stay right there. 
[02:11:00]  I want you to stay right there.  They can sit over there.  That's fine.  I like Colin right there.  Sam, get up.  This whole thing has a synergy to it.  Yes, you know these lovely lads and ladies from MTV.  Yeah.  You have a common background here.  You probably have a real nice laugh, is to tell.  All right.  I'll tell you a good Martha Quinn one, too.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Mom, when she comes in.  When she gets in.  Okay, nice.  Don't go anywhere.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer. 
[02:11:30]  He used to rape Will Fouts just to make him break character,  because he would never, he dressed up as a character for like two straight weeks.  It was so annoying.  It was so annoying, because he's like, Will.  He's like, I'm not Will.  I'm Ron Burgundy.  All right, well, Ron, can we talk?  He's like, I'm busy this week with art.  And so this went on for weeks and weeks.  And Tracy, who can never pronounce his name right, he called him Pharrell.  Will Pharrell.  Hey, Will Pharrell.  Let's play characters and break Will Pharrell. 
[02:12:00]  Let's rape him.  Me, Colin Quinn, and Tracy repeatedly raped, like fake raped him for hours.  We'd leave him in a dumpster, take his clothes off, and he would never break character.  It was so obnoxious.  Will would be, Tracy would be in the doorway as we're fake raped.  As we're literally pulling his pants down.  Tracy would be in the doorway.  We would unlit cigarette going, hurry up and save me some of that.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Sirius XM. 
[02:12:30]  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. Anthony Show.  What's your turn?  You could.  Yes.  Put the other chair back over there.  I got it.  No!  Ah!  What?  Call!  Oh, my goodness.  Of course.  Look at this.  It's like old home week here. 
[02:13:00]  Hi, Martha.  I told you that I got him his job.  Is that what happened?  Everybody sit that way.  He said there was a little story he had with Martha.  Colin, you did say.  Sit over there.  Sit over there.  Run the board, call.  Run the board, call.  There you go.  Take a seat.  Are we actually on?  Oh, yes.  I can't believe I kicked Colin out of his chair.  No, no.  He's got the helm now.  He's got the Kirk chair right now.  He's in charge, as you guys are.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:13:30]  Please.  I'm telling you.  We took pictures here yesterday.  Yes, we did.  I was a little nervous.  I had sweaty palms.  Please.  I'm freaking thrilled to have you guys here.  Of course, Alan and Martha.  Alan and Martha.  Hello.  What a great, this is great.  I've wanted to talk to you guys for so long, like, you know, 30 years.  I come up here every so often, you know, all the time, and I come and wander the halls  looking for a show to get on.  This is it.  I work here, and I look through the curtains, and I wave. 
[02:14:00]  We have an opening.  Anybody want a VJ?  Yeah.  Anybody want one?  We have an open door policy.  I just want you to know that we're going to, since I feel I can say this here.  Yeah.  We're, oh, never mind.  I better not.  Oh, you can say it.  Go ahead.  Oh, Martha.  Go ahead.  Let me think about it.  You're going to think about it?  I was just saying to Martha and Alan in the hallway, the way it's written is really great,  because it's like little, it's like whatever subject they're covering, you have four different,  you know, you have Alan, Mark, you know, and then you have Nina, then Martha, and all  four of them talking about the same thing, but it's done in such quick blurbs and in their 
[02:14:30]  own words.  It's really interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's in oral history.  Book review, Jerkoff.  What's that?  No.  I didn't like the way you were like, you know, it's interesting.  It's really great the way it's written.  He says, I really like the style of the font.  Yeah.  As an author, I felt qualified to comment on the way something was written.  I do think it was very well done, because it's tough to pull this off, as I've said on  many occasions.  Basically, what I think you're saying is we are so fascinating just in our own words. 
[02:15:00]  Yes, you are.  We did not need any management.  Well, I've got to tell you, that was not my approach initially.  I mean, I wanted the writer to write narrative.  You know, we would interview long sessions into the night with a glass of Pinot Noir, and  then he would translate it into poetry.  Right, right.  Instead, it's like, no, we're just going to translate and transcribe what you say.  It's going to be like court documents.  Oh, yeah.  Just one after another.  And then I said, hello, Dave, can I have some more Coke? 
[02:15:30]  No, man.  Who are you asking Coke from?  Dave Kendall.  Oh, no.  That's not what we were talking about.  Not Dave.  Not Dave.  Carl.  You know, he's doing a travel show in Taiwan or something.  What?  Yes.  I saw it online.  He's like, all right, now an amazing little junket we're going to take to the worm farms  of Thailand.  That sounds fascinating.  Yeah, it is Thailand.  I would watch that.  David Lee Roth, of course.  Yes, yes.  We've got stories.  What other Dave?  You're a pal.  Oh, my God.  You guys, were you so stoked? 
[02:16:00]  We had Dave here.  Yeah, he was great.  He was awesome.  He's just really funny.  Always has been.  I remember, there's a picture in the book, actually, of you and David Lee Roth, Martha.  Yes, there is.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess you must have spoken with him a few times back in this.  Spoken with him.  Yeah, spoken with him.  Pretty sure.  I'm pretty sure.  No, look at the picture, and what do you notice?  Like, can you say this?  Oh, for the folks at home.  I'm wearing not just a Boy Scout shirt, but not like a Boy Scout shirt, like jauntily open. 
[02:16:30]  Right.  A Boy Scout shirt, button to the top, with a tie.  With a tie.  It literally looked like a Boy Scout.  We call that a chastity belt.  Yeah.  Oh, there you are.  Wow.  I thought that was cute.  Well, Martha, if you want to, we can get into the many different personalities of each  VJ, which made it so unique and fun to watch back then.  But you definitely were the cute girl next door, but very, like, proper.  It didn't delve into anything the slightest bit dirty, as, you know. 
[02:17:00]  Well, you know, I went on to be a Brady.  Yes.  So it all works out.  That is true.  She was setting her career up at MTV, and it had to be clean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Squeaky, squeaky clean.  Martha would come out.  Yeah, because I remember all the clothes that you wear, very traditional.  But let me tell you.  Look, so she's.  You know, that was a period of time when, like, prep you was happening, and it did make  me feel better to see a People Magazine cover from the 80s of Jodie Foster, and it said, 
[02:17:30]  like, hot, and she was wearing mom jeans, a button-up shirt, and, like, an ascot or something.  An ascot.  See?  It wasn't just me.  That's what was happening.  And they said hot.  But it worked.  Yeah.  Well, but.  I'm sorry.  The most disastrous interview, and there's a photo of Mark talking to Bowie.  Was he, he was really bad?  Well, it was a good interview, but Bowie decided to bring up the black issue of, you know, why  aren't there any black artists on MTV, and Mark sort of got blindsided as well as he 
[02:18:00]  handled the response.  Yeah, yeah.  It was right before Jackson came on, before Beat It, before Billie Jean came on.  Right, right.  Because we were playing black artists, but, you know, Mark's description was accurate.  We were an AOR station, basically, playing rock and roll.  Right, right, right.  We didn't play pop.  And, you know, when Michael came along, it was a real chin-scratcher for the higher-ups,  but it totally made sense that that was a great song, and it was time to widen the musical  parameters in the TV, and then to bring on, bring on Billie Jean. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You guys had plenty of soul artists.  What about the Thompson Twins?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Mark's point, and other people's point, was you're playing Culture Club.  That ain't rock and roll.  So why wouldn't you play pop?  But we had Garland Jeffries, and Gary U.S.  Bonds, and Joan Armatrading.  We had black artists.  Yeah, yeah.  Who just played rock and roll.  Well, the contrasting viewpoint to that, as you could have asked Frankie Crocker, is  WBLS playing AC-DC?  Right, right.  You know, so there's two sides to that.  That's a spirit of the format.  Let them have it.  Let them have it.  Exactly. 
[02:19:00]  But we used to have to be the faces of the channel and talk to these politics, you know,  and now we don't.  Yeah, that's true.  We were watching some earlier clips.  I guess you were doing a news segment, you know, music news before videos and stuff.  And, yeah, it was kind of, you were all over with a lot of little information tidbits,  and you don't really get that anymore.  Although, is there really a need for it anymore with us being inundated with the news 24 hours  days?  I don't know.  Do people want to hear people yapping in between songs?  I don't think so.  If I want to shuffle through my Spotify or listen to Sirius. 
[02:19:30]  You were holding a script.  It was really funny to see.  Things have changed so much.  You were like, um, and you looked down at your script that's in your back pocket, and  it was like, folded up.  You were in the very early days.  You did get a teleprompter eventually.  But it was just funny to see.  You forgot, like, that's only, you know, 30 years ago.  And, man, back then, it was nothing digital.  No cell phones.  And you know what's funny?  I think television has kind of gone back to that, more of the just off-the-cuff reality.  Like, where we started, you know, doing just that, like, oh, what are we doing? 
[02:20:00]  It's come full circle to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, we were told to break.  We weren't told to break the mold.  There was no mold, really.  I mean, all the people working on the show sans the crew guys, you know, the IOTC, you  know, union guys who did the props and stuff and ran the cameras.  They knew what they were doing, but everybody else was just kids.  Producers didn't know how to produce a TV show.  So we were making this crap up all along, and I certainly didn't know what the hell I  was doing.  Most television.  Pretty much everything Colin does is because of us. 
[02:20:30]  We paved the way for Colin.  It's true.  It's true.  And MTV still has a lot of good news people.  What about Farrah Abraham?  Yeah.  Well, I like the other thing.  Is she a news person?  Oh, well, she's making the news.  Did you get Colin's gig?  Did you get Colin's gig?  No.  People have asked me that because somehow that's one of those things that we're brother  and sister.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Do you know how dumb I am?  I just realized that you both have the same last name. 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  I wasn't even putting two or two together at the same time.  Why did you say that you get Colin's gig?  She was joking when she came in.  I joking.  She would never tip them.  I used to watch you in the clubs up here.  I was a comedy whore.  Oh.  Or a pimp.  I don't know which.  But I had a good friend here, Tom, a Tom, an older guy, Tom comedian.  Wait a minute.  Tom, you know.  I think he died not long ago.  Big Tom.  Yes.  But he would, you know, you'll get his name in a minute, but he would take me to the  improv, and I would see Larry David.  Tom Curley.  Tom Curley. 
[02:21:30]  I would see Larry David implode on stage.  This was pre-  Yes.  His fame.  And he would sit at the improv on a Tuesday night and berate the audience.  That's right.  Four of them.  Right.  Yeah, fuck you.  What is that?  That's funny.  You know, you just get out of here.  Tom would go, okay, watch him.  He's really going to go for it now.  But I would do that in my off hours, and I would see you, and then when you got on MTV,  I said, man, you're big now.  Colin Quinn on remote control, of course.  Oh, my God.  Adam Sandler.  Oh, my God.  Adam Sandler on there.  Yeah, yeah.  What a Petri dish. 
[02:22:00]  And now, Ken Oba.  Of course, I was 72, we would go up late, and I used to smoke the first season, and I  smoked cigarettes on the air.  That's right.  You did.  I used to chain smoke on the show.  That was PC.  And then they told me to stop, and right after that.  Oh, they did?  Why?  Well, I did feel bad, because you know how many kids came up to me?  I started smoking because of you.  Are you kidding?  Horrible.  But then Leary came in after you were there, and then he really brought the whole smoking  thing back, I guess.  He sure did.  Yes, he did. 
[02:22:30]  LA gear sneakers.  MTV television that kills you.  How anarchic is that?  We felt it was all squeaky clean at the time when we were starting to leave, because they  were, you know, 84, 85, 86.  They really started making money.  Yeah.  Everybody was paying attention.  The record companies were in bed with them, and we started getting coaches.  They sent this to a communication coach.  Oh, boy.  About 85, was it?  I mean, we started feeling the pressure from the corporate guys. 
[02:23:00]  Great.  We started getting the kind of more official memo.  But this is a coach who also coached like George Bush.  George Bush, Dan Rather.  So we go to the Upper East Side.  Here's the new one from Kajigoo.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  What?  Well, we bring in an air check and plop it in front of the lady, and she would stare  at it.  She's like 60 years old.  Great gal.  Good communicator.  Oh, my God.  And I would go, all right.  That was Kajigoo.  Go.  Dig it.  You know, all right.  No sentences.  I didn't complete a sentence.  She says, what were you trying to communicate there?  I don't know.  I dug this song. 
[02:23:30]  She says, you need to complete your sentence.  No, I don't, by the way.  So then, I don't know.  What years were you guys there from?  81 was the beginning, and we all left kind of within a year period.  So six years for me, five and a half for you.  I kind of had two incarnations.  I had my first incarnation and my second incarnation, which is when I came in contact with you and  Ken.  And so I kind of had two generations there.  Yeah.  They knew they made a mistake with you, and then they wanted you back.  Me, it was okay if I said, I'm out here. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, boy.  I had a couple of years left in my contract.  Goodman and I sat at each, looked at each other.  After Martha went, we said, oh, my God, Martha's gone.  You know, we better leave now.  The leaving is good.  We're leaving with our own walkers.  And we said, we can't be VJ forever.  And we took off to L.A. to, you know, to stand in the unemployment line, basically.  What happened?  When you left, did you think, like, okay, I'm going to do this and this?  And then at what point did you go, like, oh, man, maybe I shouldn't have left?  Well, I had a job with Disney to do a new video show. 
[02:24:30]  I had that before I left MTV, and we were all stoked.  I was going to do something called Videopolis.  It was a little embarrassing, I'll say, to come from MTV, which was kind of, you know,  a little cutting edge and irreverent.  I'm sitting there at Disneyland doing my kind of audition, but it was like a pre-thing.  And I had now a whole new production crew, and I'm used to doing it my way.  I didn't, we weren't playing the F-bomb all over the place, but I was irreverent.  Hey, give me those cue cards, you know.  And I'm like, no, no, the cue cards need to stay over there.  And I was like, oh, no. 
[02:25:00]  And Mickey was wandering around, and I was introducing, you know, a lot of the same videos we played on MTV.  But I was thinking, okay, I'm getting paid.  I've got to have a transitional thing here.  VJ to actor, maybe it goes through Anaheim.  But the day I went to the wardrobe fitting, my manager called up and said,  don't go to the fitting.  Jeffrey Katzenberg doesn't want you.  Wow.  Yeah, he just got wind that an MTV guy was going to be the Videopolis host and said,  no, I'm not having MTV at Disney.  So I went and learned how to play golf in L.A. 
[02:25:30]  You know that, don't you?  But you said something key, Al, when you said, okay, I'm getting paid.  Like at MTV, it was the greatest job in the world.  You're like, I can't believe they're paying me.  And then when you hit the real world and you start to get subsequent jobs, you go, okay,  I'm getting paid.  I'm getting paid.  Yeah.  And better.  Getting paid better.  Oh, yeah.  MTV's the cheapest place ever.  Oh, man.  You know what I made on Movo Control?  Not that I was the lead, but I was the other guy.  A hundred bucks a show.  Wow.  A hundred bucks a show.  Wow.  They made up for it for literally being the center of the universe for a period of time. 
[02:26:00]  And there is equity in enjoying where you are.  Especially when you're young.  Right, right, right.  This is why Martha's so good, because she's putting a very positive, happy spin on you.  You're genuinely bitter, and you want to burn the building down.  And she's like, you know what?  There's a lot of laughs to be had, guys.  But what about the fact that Anthony, who we think of as this man on a constant tyrant,  goes, there is equity in being happy where you are.  Yeah, exactly.  How would you know that is a psychotic mom? 
[02:26:30]  Bite in the hand that feeds him every day.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's equity in being happy where you are.  He's in love with Martha, and he's just playing with her.  Yeah.  Who isn't?  This is not Anthony.  We don't know who this person who showed up right now is.  I've never met him.  Oh, you people.  We're going to say some affirmations in a minute.  Yeah, yeah.  Why did you leave, by the way?  Well, the first time I left, because the weirdest thing happened, the script stopped showing up  at my house.  And I was like, wow, I think I should. 
[02:27:00]  I used to have nightmares that I would go to an MTV party, and I would see JJ and Mark and  Al over with lights and producers, and there's lots of people around, but nobody was talking  to me, and I couldn't get to them.  And I'd be like, oh, my God, oh, my God.  And I'd wake up, and I'd go, oh, shit, it really did happen.  And I did get let go from MTV.  But so the first time, you know, they just didn't pick up my contract.  And then like a year and a half later, they invited me back, which is great.  It's like having your ex-boyfriend go, hey, you know what, baby? 
[02:27:30]  I do want you back.  And that felt really good.  But that time around, I knew, okay, the sun is temporary.  The first time around, I thought I would be there forever.  Yeah.  But the second time around, I was like, yeah, we'll see how long.  I'll milk this as long as we can.  That's when I met Ken and Colin and the whole remote control.  Who knew when we were doing that show, that Iron Maiden shirt reminds me, there's a lonely  boy under a house in New Jersey with a docking t-shirt playing Monster Rain. 
[02:28:00]  A little Jimmy.  Yes.  Jimmy is the prototypical MTV watcher, I bet.  You could just watch.  The thing is, you could watch it for hours and hours on end.  It was so new.  It was a digger.  It was brand new.  It seemed like people on TV were professional people.  You turned on TV and there was somebody that obviously, you didn't know people like that.  You didn't.  It was just actors and TV.  And then MTV, you guys were like, oh, I think I go to school with that guy and stuff. 
[02:28:30]  It was very relatable.  You used to come up to us all the time and go like, instead of like, oh, excuse me,  Miss Quinn would be like, hey, Martha, I like that haircut.  I'm like, could I get some respect a little bit?  None.  The familiarity was kind of, it was.  It was like we were ubiquitous for one.  And we were in everybody's life all the time.  We were in the backdrop and the wallpaper and everybody had it on all the time.  So the familiarity with people was kind of scary.  You didn't want a little awe and respect. 
[02:29:00]  I'm not Tom Cruise, but I'd like a little fainting here instead.  You guys were at parties.  Like when you had a party at your house, you just turned on MTV in the background and left that on.  There were a lot of girls to be had.  Sorry, there were a lot of girls to be had.  There were, had I not been happily married.  You were married at that time?  By the time I was married, I had it a little backwards.  I had it a little backwards.  You know, later in my life, I decided to disrupt everything and change and become a single guy again.  And my friends are like, what?  You got divorced.  You went through MTV. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, man.  You made it through that period.  But yeah, there were close scrapes with all of us.  I think we detailed a few of them in the book.  In the book, of course.  Let me say, it's called The Unplugged Adventures of MTV's First Wave.  It's called VJ.  And it's got the picture of all five of you, of course, with JJ.  And you dedicated the book to JJ.  And it's really, really well done.  I'm just flipping through it because, of course, we got it 10 minutes before you walked in.  They handed us the book.  Well, it's that easy a beach read.  Yes.  Yes.  It's a real beach read. 
[02:30:00]  Exactly.  Suck this down.  They'll be in in three minutes.  The publisher told me not to say that, by the way.  Beach read.  It's a serious examination of the culture of the 80s and the complex landscape of the Reagan era.  Yeah, I left it next to the toilet.  You know what?  A great toilet read is a compliment.  It's not an insult.  I do my best reading on the bowl.  And it's like this one, because there's like little short segments of every one of them saying something.  It's extremely comfortable to read.  You don't need four hours set aside.  I'm with you.  And I read like two pages a night on any book. 
[02:30:30]  I'm slow reader.  As a blurb.  Can we call that?  Absolutely.  Transcribe that.  Yeah.  Because that would be a great reviewer.  Absolutely.  I'll send a picture of me holding up going, with my thumbs up going, it's a two-flusher.  Oh, really?  Oh, the second printing.  Oh, I love that.  Oh, my God.  Martha, were you in any kind of relationships during that time early on at MTV?  I pretty much, when I first started MTV, I still had my high school boyfriend.  Oh, wow.  I mean, that was early on in my life.  Now, what was he thinking?  Like, the jealousy must have been crazy, because guys were really kind of in love with you. 
[02:31:00]  Flowers big time, then.  Hey, Martha.  No, I don't know.  And then, I kind of, I always sort of had...  I don't remember this boyfriend at all.  He never showed up around, you'd never brought him down.  We'd meet him at him.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I never saw him.  He disappeared pretty quickly, but...  Yeah.  Of course.  Can I ask you, who was the most tempting rock star to hit on you?  There had to be one, or maybe you'd be hooked up with someone.  Can I show you this Boy Scout shirt or anything again?  Oh, was it him?  No, I'm just saying that, you know... 
[02:31:30]  Not a lot of...  Well...  She had so many suitors, and most of them were in middle America, who'd come up to me  and go, uh, Mark Hunter, Mark...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, right, right.  That's me, and it's like, what's that Martha Quinn like?  Oh, I want to do her.  I mean...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, what happened to a little respect here?  Yeah, exactly.  All I did was answer questions about you.  What happened to a little respect is all I'm asking.  But there were...  Was it hard to cultivate any kind of relationship with somebody outside of there when you were kind 
[02:32:00]  of...  You're a very public person.  Um, not really, no.  It wasn't really.  I mean, I don't really understand your question.  You had a private life.  No, I just mean, like, as far as relationship, did you have any serious boyfriends during  that time?  I'm one of those girls who I kind of always have, you know, a serious boyfriend.  I'm not really the dating type, really.  Right.  Serial boyfriends.  Ultimately...  I'm telling you, she hops...  She had a crush on me.  She had a crush on Mark.  She had a crush on David Lee Roth.  Yeah, basically, you see, the whole book is like, I used to... 
[02:32:30]  I used to imagine I was Mrs. Rick Springfield in there later.  I used to imagine I was Mrs. Michael Jackson in there later.  I used to imagine I was Mrs. David Lee Roth.  Okay.  But, uh...  I had a sign behind her head saying, she'll break your heart.  Watch out.  Leave her alone.  Well, luckily, I am now Mrs. Jordan Tarlow.  I know.  So, at all, I did achieve my dream.  The funny thing is, is that we all became brother and sisters.  Yeah.  Brothers and sisters.  I mean, that's how we...  You know, we had a little...  We had one small dressing room in the beginning down in Hell's Kitchen.  It was a crappy little studio.  You know, so the guys and the girls all had to dress together. 
[02:33:00]  So, in the beginning, there was Nina and Martha and Fantasies.  But then it quickly became...  Oh, I didn't know about that, did you?  Of course, there was a little heat there.  No doubt.  You know?  But then one day, two, three years later, she shows up on the set with Stiv Bader.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lose a new church.  Yeah.  So, it's like, that's her type?  Really?  Yeah.  We love Stiv.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  But, you know, you like the roadie types, though.  You like those lanky, wiry, kind of spooky, scary types. 
[02:33:30]  And that's the sweetheart of America.  Stiv was the best relationship I ever had, because through Stiv, I met my husband via  Brett Gerwitz in Bad Religion.  That's how it all worked out.  So, it's funny how that happened.  Great picture of you and Ozzy, too.  Great picture of Martha and Ozzy from, like, what's that, like, 83?  I know.  He's like...  84.  And did you just come on to the set?  Because you didn't interview him.  That was my interview, I think.  I think...  We were always photobombing our interviews, you know?  Yeah, look at that, right?  Pissed me off, because I interviewed Ozzy, and that was, you know... 
[02:34:00]  You know, I'm sure Ozzy didn't only come in one time, Al.  You might have interviewed him once, and I might have interviewed him.  Well, Mark cops the Madonna interview, like he did the only Madonna interview, and I was  the first one to interview her at the limelight here.  And then I called her fleshy in some interview, and Daily News ran that a couple weeks ago.  And they said, VJ calls Madonna fleshy.  That was the headline in the post.  And I thought, I'm going to get my legs capped.  But then how did you handle that, Al? 
[02:34:30]  Well, I said it again and again.  You said it again on the Today Show.  I said it on the Today Show.  Why did Bob Dylan fly you to Ireland?  Look at me, how cute am I?  It was for that reason.  Look at me, how cute am I?  Well, fair enough.  He said it was a party.  Did you hook up with him?  No.  Did he try?  No, no, no, no, not at all.  This is a very historic picture, because this is the first time that Bob Dylan and Bono  were ever photographed together, and I'm literally photobombing him.  It's amazing.  There's an amazing photo of Bono. 
[02:35:00]  He's got like a great clockwork orange hat.  Yes.  Looks like an Amish man.  Yeah, and Bob Dylan and Martha, and you're looking the wrong way, but it's still kind  of a great picture.  They're looking into the camera, and you're looking off at someone.  Who's more interesting that way than Bono and Bob Dylan?  I would love to know who's standing off to the side.  I will tell you who was there, and I used to have a picture of it, and I lost it, and  I'm so mad at myself.  Van Morrison was there at the same time, and I had a picture of me, Bono, Bob, and Van 
[02:35:30]  Morrison, and I don't know where it went.  Yes.  Sorry.  It's even better than the one that's in there.  But so imagine in your mind Van Morrison.  Yeah.  So are you saying that there's a lot of good pictures in VJ, The Unplugged Adventures of  MTV?  Yes, there really are.  Yes.  Are you guys still doing signings, by the way?  Yes.  Tonight, we're going to be down at the Apple Store in Soho.  We've got some event down there, and then we're going to be in Paramus, New Jersey tomorrow.  Nice.  It's a little rough on Al and I.  What the...  Because we're kind of... 
[02:36:00]  Germophobes?  Oh, yeah.  So you don't like the whole shaking hands?  Oh.  Somebody yesterday...  Give hugs and tongues.  No!  I'm terrible.  Had to say excuse me and run to the restroom.  Of course.  I'm so worried.  You know, it's...  They're filthy.  Do you not like shaking...  I get a really weird...  Not a rude vibe.  Just like...  We shook hands, I think, the other day when I saw you.  And I sensed that if I had just waved from across the room, you would have been just  as comfortable.  You didn't see her squeegee her fingers with that...  Yeah.  No, it's okay. 
[02:36:30]  I understand.  Don't take it personal.  Kid Kelly's got the best move.  He comes up and he like elbow bumps you.  That's horrendous.  No, no.  And he says, I have a cold, so I don't want to get you sick.  See, that's perfect.  But see, what I think is he doesn't have a cold.  Right.  He just doesn't want to shake hands.  Kid Kelly.  He's here on SiriusXM.  Exactly.  Tell him to fucking relax.  He's going to use so much Purell that he's going to start to get warts on his fingers  because the Purell erodes your natural ability to fight.  I don't like a whole lot of germs.  Shut up.  I'm just trying to talk about germs. 
[02:37:00]  I think it moves the germs around.  Martha, did you have a problem with...  I just wanted to get back to...  I'll talk about the book signings, which I did rudely interrupt.  I'm done.  Paramus.  Apple Store tonight.  And then after this book tour, who knows where else we'll go.  As you guys know who've written books, you've got to sell some more books.  Then maybe we'll hit L.A.  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be nice.  Or, I don't know.  But, you know, publishing is a tight business.  The margins are low.  And we went out to eat the other night, and the publishers are like, 
[02:37:30]  Hey, it's a food and beverage while you guys are here is on us.  And I'm thinking, is it like the record business where they take it out of your royalties?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You think that's happening?  I don't know.  Because we went to the sushi joint for like $5 million the other night.  It's all in the publishers.  Yeah, I'm sure they...  I'm doing the same trap that musicians have done since time began.  Yeah, it's on the record company, man.  Yeah.  Well, that's a big vial of Coke.  They bought it.  They bought it.  And our studio session was $500 million. 
[02:38:00]  So we're going lean and mean.  Yeah, yeah.  You did bring us breakfast.  You're a nice intern.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, good.  So is that on you guys?  Totally on the house.  This is on the house.  Absolutely.  A good Thursday budget.  He kind of hesitated.  Well, no.  Because I'm trying to take like, guys, CXM, they're kind of cheap.  We were last minute guys.  We were last minute guests.  Yeah.  Well, we definitely want to have you in.  Definitely.  How did...  I have to ask, too, about JJ.  How did JJ die?  I mean, I remember what happened. 
[02:38:30]  I just don't remember how.  Yeah, as Mark says, he had a bad ticker.  He had like triple bypass surgery, I don't know how many years ago, early 2000s, I guess.  But, you know, so he was a big hearted guy with a tough heart.  He died of a heart attack basically on the highway, pulled over in Ventura, in the valley, I guess.  No, he was in Hollywood.  How wrong can I get this story?  He's in Hollywood.  He died of a heart attack on the 405 and ran into 50 people, but that's not the story.  He pulled over on the side of the road in his Corvette so that he wouldn't run into anybody else, and he died on the side. 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  That was 2004.  That was a shocker for sure, and we were talking about his funeral the other day in some cheesy place on La Brea.  Big funeral, tacky funeral home, and it was packed with all of these eccentric people.  JJ had a closet full of life.  I mean, there's so much we didn't know about him, and every day you have a different tale about Iwo Jima and going to the club last night.  But people would always show up in the streets, hey, I'm JJ Jackson's friend. 
[02:39:30]  He'd go, really?  You are?  You know?  He had just an amazing caterer of friends from stars like Rod Stewart to just, you know, the person who was at his pharmacy.  But they all showed up at the funeral, including Rod Stewart, in the back, weeping.  Wow.  And it was a pretty phenomenal moment.  Like, our friend was well-loved.  The last time I saw Colin was at Ken's funeral.  Yeah.  That was the saddest situation.  There was a minute there when it was coming out, oh, it's a hoax.  And I called Ken's cell phone, and I said, you better call me back, you bastard. 
[02:40:00]  You better call me back.  Yes, I remember that.  Oh, so.  That was so shocking.  Why did you think it was a hoax?  What happened?  Because, you know, on the internet, it started to come out, Ken Ober's dead.  And then it came out kind of right after, oh, it's a hoax, it's a hoax.  And I was like, oh, okay.  Because, you know, that happens.  You're not familiar with that?  Yeah.  No, no.  I mean, I know that the lies happen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So that's what it came out.  But it seemed like it was.  So I was like, you better call me back, you bastard. 
[02:40:30]  Call me back right now.  And then, of course, it turned out to be true.  And it was really, you know, super shocking.  It was very shocking.  I didn't talk to Colin, though, because he was up on stage surrounded by, you know, superstars.  So I just snuck out the back.  Oh, Colin.  Yeah, exactly.  Speaking of the 80s rock stars, have you guys met Simply Red's son?  Sam.  Speaking of the 80s, I have to go prep for the VJ Big 40 Countdown.  Yes.  Friday night, 9 o'clock east, 6 o'clock west. 
[02:41:00]  Don't got to tell me.  We get humbled every day, don't we?  I mean, the story of our lives at MTV was humility.  Again, it was the MTV thing.  It was the big corporate MTV thing.  Can I just say one thing?  Do you guys agree with this?  Even though people looked at, at that time, being on MTV, and even when I was there,  people would almost make no differential between Bruce Springsteen and you.  Like, because there weren't that many stars.  So people would be like, you were like as big, you know what I mean, in a certain way, 
[02:41:30]  even though people were familiar.  When I was there, people would treat you like you were like as famous as the people in videos.  God, if only we had Twitter back then, we would have so many followers.  Oh, man.  We'd have millions.  Right?  We'd be there.  You know, the, yeah, it's hard for me to concur because I'll lose my humility if I do.  But, you know, there was a certain sort of parody there.  It made it easier to interview these people when they'd come into the studios.  Hey, Martha, how you doing?  It was like, whoa.  I remember coming in to see Robert Plant after J.J. interviewed him. 
[02:42:00]  It was a large entourage.  The whole office came down to the studio, of course, when there was somebody big and shoved us out of the way.  But Robert was there and I decided to go in and just make this funny little bowing motion on my knees.  And I bowed down to Sir Robert Plant and he goes, arise, Sir Alan.  And I was like, oh, God knows my name.  But these guys were watching, you know, in their hotel rooms on tour.  Yes, exactly.  Even Springsteen because this phenomenon was amazing.  So they knew it was all.  Man, Martha's got to go, obviously.  We want to give the book a big plug, though.  We have to break anyway.  VJ, The Unplugged Adventures of MTV's First Wave. 
[02:42:30]  It's out there in what you call your bookstores.  Yeah, or online.  Or online, of course.  You can probably order it online.  Yeah, yeah.  You can download it.  Oh, you can download the Kindle version.  Go for it.  It's crazy in the future.  Well, I appreciate you guys having this on.  Yes, thank you.  I love this show.  Love having you guys out.  I'll see you guys going to Rachel Ray.  Yes, we're going to Rachel Ray.  Awesome.  All right.  Look at you guys.  Drop down with us.  I'm going to whip up some nice recipes.  Some free saves.  Yeah.  And some moose.  The signing is tonight at the Apple Store. 
[02:43:00]  Apple Store appearance tonight.  Apple Store.  Soho.  Apple Store, Soho.  Tomorrow, Paramus, New Jersey.  Barnes & Noble.  Around 6 o'clock.  Great.  Alan and Martha, thanks so much for coming in.  Thank you.  We'll be right back.  It was fun.  Love it.  Fuck it up, you old tree. 
[02:43:30]  Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cobretti is out on the streets, cleaning up the scum.  Do you know how much damage you did out there, Cobretti?  Yeah.  Much as I needed.  Hey, I got those people out of there. 
[02:44:00]  Cobretti likes women who shit on tabletops made of glass that he's sitting under.  I like that.  It's a fetish, but it keeps me relaxed in my topsy-turvy world.  Cobretti likes a nice, firm shit.  I've got a hot deuce for you, Cobretti.  Hey, Cobra.  This is my fat wife, Susan.  Could you drink some beer and shoot her in the face?  Obesity is the disease. 
[02:44:30]  Diet's the cure.  Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cobretti.  Yeah, right.  I got a name like a faggot, but I sure as fuck do kick some ass.  Hey, Cobra.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  You've got to do that Run DMC version. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  I don't love it.  I'm going to cover it.  Say nothing.  You know Run DMC didn't even know the lyrics to that song?  No.  Oh, I saw the thing, the little biography thing on that.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, like both sides didn't want to do it.  Even Aerosmith's like, what?  Fuck that shit.  They're going to fuck our song up.  And they're like, what?  We just wanted to fucking sample the beat.  Shit.  We don't want that motherfucker singing on this motherfucker.  You know what they were talking about.  No. 
[02:45:30]  That was a great start to sign up.  Ow, ow, ow.  They start breaking through the wall like, oh my God, they're coming together.  And if you heard the beginning and then this kicked in, you're like, oh fuck, man.  I want to hear Aerosmith.  These guys.  Even back then, huh?  Oh yeah, always.  Yeah.  I've been flaming racist for my entire life.  My entire life.  Not even adult life.  If you recall, I told a story about when Beauty's Hill, me and my brother lit it on fire in the ELs, in the Elwood development. 
[02:46:00]  It was Beauty's Hill.  There was a horse named Beauty and it lived up there on the hill.  So we would light fires down there.  My brother would stomp it out before it got too big.  But then it got too big.  And it burnt the entire Beauty's Hill down.  The fire department showed up, put the fire out.  And then we were standing there and they asked us what happened.  And I said, two Negroes lit the fire on Beauty's Hill.  It was a lie.  And it was a lie.  I blamed black people.  Just because.  I was in kindergarten.  So that's how. 
[02:46:30]  Kindergarten?  I was in kindergarten.  So that's how deep my racism goes.  And you knew.  What's up, yo?  I won't say it can't.  I know you guys are into Purell.  Ah, fuck.  I don't give a shit.  That was so funny.  Pull up a chair.  Pull up a mic.  We'll hang out.  Absolutely.  I was just talking about lighting a fire when I was in kindergarten in the neighborhood I lived in.  And it got out of control.  And the fire department showed up.  And my brother, who was about a year and a half older than me at the time, we told the firemen that black people started it. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, really?  So I'm just like, yeah, my racism was fucking set way back when.  I used to set hotel management on fire.  Yeah.  Just to piss my father off.  Yeah.  How'd that work out?  Well, it was a hollow victory.  But the waiters running back and forth.  Like, well, I'm going to be like, see how good I treat you.  Then you're like, well, what's happening?  Because all the waiters running back.  It's a fire.  It's a fire.  It's a fire.  It's a fire.  And they see them tiptoe back and forth.  And I was just like, it's just me getting back at you, Dad. 
[02:47:30]  It never amounted to a career.  Could have blamed it on black people.  Could have blamed it on the black people.  Yeah, I'm building different fires.  Oh, is that it?  Who would have known I could have blamed it on the Jews?  Ah, Jews.  You could blame it on any really other ethnic group.  No, the Jews.  Oh, okay.  Them too.  Somebody from years ago when I was a kid Facebooked me recently and said that when we were kids,  we lit a fire.  He goes, you remember we lit that fire and blamed it on black kids?  I'm like, no.  Must be a rite of passage for white kids.  Yes.  Totally unconnected.  Believe me.  30 years apart. 
[02:48:00]  30 years?  You fuck.  Yeah, move up a little bit.  You guys were connected in the Quantum Leap kind of thing.  Yes, yes.  Are you on?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're always on.  I had no idea.  See, the Parkinson goes away when I act gay.  It's a hetero closet case.  No, I found out.  Really?  When I talk gay, a certain kind, phenomenal, phenomenal showman gay, I have no Parkinson's.  But when I'm hetero, I'm like, how old am I?  Why do I act like my Aunt Eddie?  Holy shit. 
[02:48:30]  How did you find out you had it?  Because that's like a new thing.  I mean, you have no idea.  I went to the hospital for three months because these medications collided where I OD'd or  I had appendicitis.  One or the other, huh?  Yeah.  And we went to the Mayo Clinic because, I don't know, she knows the story.  It's all blank in my head.  And when you go to the hospital for three months, you end up talking. 
[02:49:00]  That's all you talk about when you get out.  You're like, I was in the hospital for three months.  I was in the hospital for three months.  You know what happened to me?  And other people are like, I was in the hospital, too.  What'd you have?  What'd you have?  Your whole paradigm shifts.  Fuck that, though.  You don't want to make that your entire fucking existence, right?  I know.  No, you don't.  Yeah, shit.  That's why I'm going to cheat on Tracy like crazy.  I will be an animal again.  Oh, we are in here.  I can hear myself.  Yeah, there we are.  You know what I'm going to do?  When I'm not funny, I'm going to talk trendy. 
[02:49:30]  That's a trendy talk.  Like the new New York.  The new Williamsburg.  Of no importance whatsoever and vacuous.  That is...  Like the name Rachel Ray sounds fun to say.  Well, that's where Colin just went.  Colin's going to make cupcakes.  Colin just went over there to Rachel Ray.  I don't know what he's going to do.  What is he going to do over Rachel Ray?  Colin is...  Colin's good.  He can blend in.  Colin's a fucking aging queen.  He'll be fine on Rachel Ray's queen.  An aging queen.  Talking about fucking...  Talking about Irish recipes.  It's corned beef and cabbage, Rachel. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, he'll do ironic fucking references about stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, back in here, we'll hunt cream.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about some potatoes?  They'll do a whole blight thing.  You know, you can make these chocolate darlings in Hell's Kitchen  when no one's looking.  And then he'll run his pinky across the ice and go,  that is good.  Yeah.  Man, so, yeah, so you were in the hospital for four months.  No, a year.  A year?  A year.  I was in the hospital for three months.  I was in the hospital for a year.  Now, you were in for three months, 
[02:50:30]  and then you were in every month after that for a year.  How do you live in a hospital?  Like, like...  Oh, it's the worst.  Does it just become...  You become an institutionalized, happy moron.  Is that it?  Oh, I...  Oh, man.  I had an argument with a guy...  Over the cookie.  Fix his mic.  Over the cookie.  Mayo Clinic, Iraq.  You like that place?  Yeah, got it.  He loves mayo.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thanks.  I'm used to being treated like a 90-year-old waiting for a wheelchair in an airport. 
[02:51:00]  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, is that frustrating?  Because you're an independent dude.  Yeah.  To have people...  Even though the people are trying to help you,  but have people doing basic shit for you?  Like, wipe your ass?  Yeah.  They'd have the ugliest nurses.  They had, like, U-turn necks, necks hanging in yous.  Like, they were incubating chicks and cockroaches.  It looked like the Star Wars bar.  Where are they now?  I mean, the ugliest.  And then I got stuck.  I couldn't move.  I got stuck between the mattress and the railing, like, squeezed in. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, shit.  And I said, can you help me?  I'd be like, I've got to watch Charlie.  I'll be right there.  And nobody would come.  And so I saw the emergency ass wipe button.  And I said, if I press that and they slide in,  gorgeous, hermetically sealed girls from the OC with diamond earrings.  Little button-nosed rabbits would hop in and be like,  do you need your ass wipe?  And I was like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then after a while, you're sliding down. 
[02:52:00]  There's only, you look stupid.  You're sliding.  She's fucking some guy.  And you're the guy who's sliding down the wall like a broken Spider-Man.  Slipping down.  You look over your shoulder and all your macho is gone.  No matter how many times you cursed out Lee Marvin or he envied you.  No matter how many cowboy boots you were born with.  The only face you can make when some beautiful girl is like wiping your ass for the fifth time is, is this. 
[02:52:30]  God.  That doesn't.  And then the sentence comes out of your mouth.  They're like, don't say.  You're really, you're like this.  You're like, was there a lot?  Oh, no.  And you're like, oh, God.  I'm dead.  Just take me.  Oh, no.  It leads to suicide.  Oh, my God.  Fucking bullshit.  I guess the only, the only comfort you can take him is in that environment to them.  That literally is, it's just a part of the job.  Like for fucking, for us, it's, it's walking on or dealing with a stage.  Yeah, man.  You think it is? 
[02:53:00]  If you're working in a hospital and you're dealing with people, shit is not, they're cleaning out wounds that smell and fucking.  Yeah, yeah.  They're really doing shit.  Shit is like, again, that's to us like a fucking busted stage light or something like that.  It's a fucking, probably an unpleasant part of their job.  They don't even give a, like, they don't, your, your shit and asshole is, your, your asshole probably looks like it should look.  Like it's the fucking, a rotten thing with shit in it.  But when they see a beautiful girl and her asshole looks like that, that's the fucking heartbreaker.  You know, a guy's ass should be a fucking disaster. 
[02:53:30]  So you call me perfectly normal.  Send me in a guy whose ass looks like W.C. Fields' face and I'll feel more comfortable.  Don't send me a girl in that I'm going to try to hit on while shit's pouring out of my ass.  Yeah, yeah.  Single shot.  Single, they would say, is it a single shot?  What was it?  What kind of shit was it?  Was it a single shot?  Single shot.  Well, that's what we're striving for.  I tried to get a fucking cookie because the guy was on the phone, on his daughter's bejeweled phone. 
[02:54:00]  And I said, we missed breakfast.  I said, can I, can you hand me that cookie?  And he says, can't have no cookies.  You missed cookie call.  And that's when I started to feel like a moron.  And I said, no, just give me the cookie.  And he goes, you missed cookie call.  And I had to use the word humanity on him.  And like Martin Luther King, you will feel the vibrations of a visionary writhe and undulate from deep within.  And you will feel the course of humanity run through your veins. 
[02:54:30]  If you hand me the cookie, you'll be like Martin Luther King because I missed breakfast because you're on your daughter's phone talking to some guy about a deal.  Just hand me the cookie.  And that would feel good to have these arguments about nothing.  Like to cause some kind of heated discourse.  Right, something.  And I'm angry.  Like my hitting hand is a hand that shakes.  And I punch people in L.A.  Guys walked into a restaurant. 
[02:55:00]  I don't know when to stop anymore because I've been in a hospital.  So you'll tell me, it's time to stop, Mr. Shapiro.  I have to wheel you to your room.  But I forgot what I was saying.  You saw that cookie time.  A guy at the 101 was pulling girls' hairs, running up and down the restaurant.  He was like a UCB type guy.  He had a bow tie on, but he was tall.  So I took a chance. 
[02:55:30]  And I told my friend, I said, why is nobody stopping this guy?  They're on dates, and the dates aren't stopping the guy.  And they go, it's L.A., man.  They'll chill out.  So he plops down the booth next to me.  And I said, I got this new stutter, too.  It happens between 9 and 9.  And he goes, it's L.A.  They'll chill out.  And he plops down the booth next to me.  And I said, you're a fucking retard in New York. 
[02:56:00]  I don't even know how to get angry anymore.  I've been in L.A. since I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  But back then, I said, you're a fucking retard.  And he goes, but I was thinking, Brett, aren't we all retarded?  Isn't everyone retarded?  Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  Isn't everyone retarded?  Aren't we all retarded?  And I went, no, you are.  My hand went up his nose.  And I hit him.  And the guy gives me a speech.  My new friend with his H&M haircut and his little henna tattoo.  What's bothering you?  What's bothering you?  And there's more to that story, but I'll chime in a little later. 
[02:56:30]  But he had me at that moment like, oh, you're right.  These hands.  What am I capable of?  These hands.  And then these two guys walked out and were like, we stuck out for you.  Yeah, because we're fans of yours.  You were doing just what you do on stage.  You were raging against the plasticity of society.  I went, I said, I'm a hero.  Where's my snakeskin horse guitar named Elvis?  I just threw in guitar and Elvis.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:57:00]  What are you?  What am I on?  No, no.  What do they have you?  We are not.  No, no.  What do they have you taking?  What's the prognosis?  The prognosis is good.  Oh, is it?  The prognosis is really good.  When they told us at the Mayo that he has Parkinson's, he goes, but you got the good  kind.  He goes, it's good news.  I said, you have a nice tie.  What was the good news?  I don't have it.  But it's not the kind that deteriorates.  It's a kind that 20 years from now will start deteriorating. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  But they can get rid of the symptoms.  They say you're lucky because we can get rid of the symptoms.  What kind is Ali and Mike?  Because most people don't have a, like, they have the severe kind.  They have the severe kind.  Ali and Michael J. Fox.  They break it down towards stages and Ricky's in a stage.  But because his was environmentally induced through head injury and bad medications for  many years.  Environmentally induced, amen, because I was living with you.  I'm an abusive boyfriend. 
[02:58:00]  I gave him Parkinson's.  Jesus.  Just for the publicity.  Come on, when you're being controlled, your hand tends to shake.  No, so.  She's actually great.  You fucking saved my ass.  Yeah, so with all the damage that was done with head injury and medication, it's not  that they can fix it or not that they can make it go away, but they can increase his  dopamine levels, get the shake and the stiffness gone, and resume a normal life.  He said up to 90% of normal life.  You know, so.  90%.  That says it casually in me. 
[02:58:30]  I make it 100%.  Now, what was the head injury's?  Oh, it was a car.  Well, that was a car accident.  Right.  He was hit in the head with a two-by-four before that.  I hit him in the head a couple times with an encyclopedia.  Who hit you with a two-by-four?  I was raised to protect my brother.  So, my brother got into a yelling match.  So, I jumped in, went to hit the guy.  And I'm not a good hitter or anything, but I just was taught to jump in.  And some guy comes around with a two-by-four from behind and knocks me out.  Oh, fuck.  And I was gone for a day. 
[02:59:00]  Wow.  How long was this?  This was years ago.  I live in the past, so I don't have to concentrate on your career.  I'm jealous, envious, but when I see Jimmy, when I saw his show, you got to see it.  It was so beautiful to see an honest comedian dissect and work his own brain out.  Like, it was so cool to hear Colin talk now.  You don't see it in L.A.  It breaks my heart.  I get choked up. 
[02:59:30]  Because guys, they all go to class now.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never heard class talk.  It's a UCB.  It's a hugely different scene in New York than L.A.  It's awful.  Yeah, yeah.  It's stupid.  I risk being broke because I like to riff, but now I got a commercial.  The weird thing was, every time I wanted to leave L.A., something came.  Two films, a commercial, a couple of TV shows, and I wasn't getting that shit before I had Parkinson's. 
[03:00:00]  You know, they must think I'm a brilliant career actor, character actor now.  Look how he's shaking for the cup.  Oh, Days of Wine and Roses.  He's educated.  Is that the guy from the Broken Money show?  What's it called?  Bust My Money?  That guy on the TV show.  I thought you meant Sam.  No, Sam.  So they got you on dopamine.  What's the process?  Would that take a while?  Yeah, it's called Leave Adopacarbon.  Leave Adopacarbon, and it's supposed to, they do it in, like, an increasing amount. 
[03:00:30]  So you start off at 0.5, then you go to 1.5, then 1.5, then 1.0, then 1.5, and it's supposed  to, like, start to generate and get the dopamine levels in his brain back up to where they're  supposed to be.  So that's really the big problem right now.  His dopamine levels are really low.  So once they increase, you know, his stiffness, his mobility, his shake, it's all going to 
[03:01:00]  go, it's all going to decrease, and then eventually go away.  And that's the stuff of, the dope I heard of, it was in Awakenings, that was the stuff  that they gave to all those patients that were fucking out for so long, and then it woke  them up, and then it didn't, you know.  I thought it was when Iraq was in a bad mood.  It's dopamine.  No, but the funny thing about Awakenings is De Niro, De Niro wakes up like he's been  boxing for 80 years.  His back is like a bull.  He wakes up like Russell Crowe.  He's like, have I been asleep for 30 years? 
[03:01:30]  All right, let's go hit the road.  Yeah, yeah.  There'd be some issues he would have to, yeah, some muscular issues.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just laying in bed.  And he gets up and he goes, I feel like walking fast.  But I ask away.  So it will take a while to take effect, but when it does, you can get back to, like,  because performing, obviously, for you is really important.  Yeah, I still go on three times a week.  Oh, you are?  Okay, good.  Yeah, because once I hit the mark, once I'm on stage, I'm fine. 
[03:02:00]  I'm fine.  Because I get it all out.  But afterwards, I'm, like, drained, and I don't have the fun of hanging out.  And so I have to run home.  It's just, that's what I hate, because it's L.A. too, you know.  But it's not as big.  I mean, it's, it, when it first started off back in April of 2012, his hands were like  bats, like, just shaking uncontrollably.  Now it's like a small tremor.  And it's just decreasing and decreasing.  And when he gets on stage, it's less. 
[03:02:30]  Sometimes it's more.  It's whether his adrenaline is up.  But he is.  He's booking stuff.  He's doing commercials.  He did a movie all on Parkinson's before he got the label.  So it's really just a matter of adjusting things and getting rid of it.  Yeah.  It's not going to be as bad as what Michael J. Fox said, at least not today.  You know, 20 years down the road, I can't say.  But then 20 years down the road, there might be, what do they call those?  A remedy.  It might be a remedy.  One of them remedies.  One of them remedies.  One of those remedies.  But before the show, before the diagnosis, I had a radio show and I was busy as hell and 
[03:03:00]  running around.  Now I barely read the newspaper.  But that's me concentrating on the negative.  Like, in L.A., all they do is talk about, they don't have opinions, but they're positive  or negative.  Yeah.  But now everyone's telling me, you got to be positive.  You got to know.  Because I go into like, oh, wait, I'm a casualty.  But I'm not.  Like, I can step up on stage. 
[03:03:30]  But I want to do more.  I write a paragraph every now and then, you know, every couple of days.  And I was writing three hours.  Like, I wrote a book out.  My book's unfiltered.  It's called Unfiltered.  You can buy it on Kindle, Relapse, Rehab, whatever.  Redo, iPad, IHOP, Perkins, and just shut up and buy the book.  Listen to that riff.  Perkins and Evil were thrown into the same riff.  Perkins and Evil. 
[03:04:00]  So it's a hybrid.  Do you ever fucking slow down?  No.  I mean, do you know?  No?  Yeah, right now I do.  Now I'll be like, can we go home now?  Well, I have to rest my weary, weary world driven to dark places.  And now I have to watch Law and Order, SVU.  Is this SVU or Criminal Intent?  I'm so desensitized to rape I'm having the time of my life.  And these aren't bits, Jimmy, even though they are.  They completely are. 
[03:04:30]  These are not riffs.  It's just hanging out with you.  I feel so comfortable.  Do you sleep easy or is that a pain in the ass?  No, you give me the sleeping pill.  Well, that's the crazy thing.  I don't sleep easy, though.  I'm up all of that.  That's the crazy thing, though.  All the problems.  No, that's right.  All the problems that they had that he was diagnosed over the past 10 years, depression,  insomnia, irritability, all those things were symptoms of Parkinson's.  If they had just done the one test, the one test, we would have been able to cap all 
[03:05:00]  that stuff either last year or years ago.  I mean, his hands started shaking a couple of years ago.  One test.  He had a neurologist say, oh, you're getting better.  Play basketball.  Get a hobby.  He said under his breath, this tough-looking, like, I hate to say it, but gorgeous Asian  guy.  Oh, he's gorgeous.  He had a chest.  And he looked, you're so ensconced and brainwashed by pop culture that he looked like an American 
[03:05:30]  apparel ad, the hero, like the guy who fucks a girl in the futon.  And that's not a bit.  No.  And he says under his breath, he goes, I don't know, play basketball.  I go, so what do I do now?  I don't know, play basketball.  What is that supposed to be?  That's the big diagnosis.  That was the big thing.  That's the big, uh...  That was it.  And that was back in November of 2012.  So it's like, you know, we're constantly going to doctors and constantly doing tests.  It was one test at the mail.  One test.  They showed the brain thing, uh, the glowering little dots of dopamine. 
[03:06:00]  I threw in glowering, so the brain talk isn't boring.  It worked.  It worked, though.  Glowering.  Did I come in on because I was insecure that because of the Parkinson's, I'd be like, well,  my wife and I just got back from a cruise.  Like, I don't even know what to call it.  I was in denial about it.  Yeah, I couldn't think of the fucking name that I kept calling it. 
[03:06:30]  My Aunt Edna's scotch-sipping, Benson and Hedges smoking, worrying about her son Scotty  with shaky hands disease, or the Edwin Deluxe, or the Parallax View Opious.  I couldn't think of the name.  It's funny how the mind works when it doesn't give a shit about you anymore.  Holy fuck.  Do you feel betrayed by your own physique?  I'm going through a better phase.  Yeah?  Yeah, and people say, well, you've lived such a wild life.  I'm like, what wild life? 
[03:07:00]  Like, I screwed around.  Hmm.  I stuck my dick in shit.  What's the big deal?  What's the big deal?  Stuck my dick in shit.  Do you have to make yourself get out every day, or is it, like, tempting just to sit  there and just go fuck it and give up, or do you say, no, I'm not going to do that?  Uh, well, I don't call it giving up because right now the doctor said I need a lot of rest.  Oh, okay.  But on the other hand...  But I'm sick of sleeping.  But I train.  I have a physical trainer who trains me hard. 
[03:07:30]  He breaks my ass.  Yeah, and they say that the patients with Parkinson's that do the most exercise and do the best nutrition  are the ones that have the least impact.  And I don't have that kind of discipline.  Like, I, you know...  You're like a jock now.  Well, I have to make a lot of appointments, so I train to keep everything going on, but  I don't want to give up, but I don't know what that is yet.  But I just realized today I hate the word casualty, and I don't plan on being that. 
[03:08:00]  You can use all those other words, like giving up, whatever, but casualty is like, no, I'm  going to beat this.  I'm going to be as strong as Muhammad Ali is now.  I'm kidding.  My first Parkinson's jokes against people with Parkinson's.  Yeah, just attack people who have it worse.  I take the worst.  Holy fuck.  God must really hate him.  That's terrible. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, God must really hate him.  Oh my God.  What an evil thing to say.  Ali is very...  I met him once, and he was very...  Like, I expected him to be shaking, and he was very still.  And I mean, like, he hardly...  He couldn't really talk.  Yeah.  But they must have him on something very heavy because he's not shaking.  But that's another form.  But what is he on that he's not moving?  Because I'm like, it must be heavy meds, which is why he was so...  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Well, so it's funny.  I don't know.  But the other night, my friend looked at me and he goes, you're so still.  And that was the first time anyone called me that in my whole life.  So I was taken aback.  I was like, do I want to be?  Like, I liked how I was before because I wasn't in so much pain.  You know, and so I don't know.  What's wrong with my hands fucking shaking? 
[03:09:30]  Like, I have a line on stage.  Like, I'm not shaking because I'm nervous.  I'm shaking because shaky's a new cool.  If you ain't shaking, you ain't stepping up to shit.  Girls go out with the guy who goes, hi, or you want to go out with me?  Don't go out with that guy.  Go out with the guy who says, you, you, you, you, me, me, you, me, you, me, you, me, you, you, you.  Fuck in the bathroom.  Punch line, pow.  Well, why can't we shake?  Why do I have to, this, I get into a rage about it.  Yeah.  Yeah, people don't breathe, meditate, all of a sudden. 
[03:10:00]  And now I'm learning, I listen to a relaxation tape before I go to sleep.  And now I find myself calming down during the day.  Who cares about it?  I never thought I'd be talking about this stuff on the O.B. and Anthony.  Eh, what are you going to do?  The last time I was on, you were talking about colostomies.  So I guess I'm entitled to it.  The last time I was on, Anthony was sleeping.  Is that, was that that show?  You know, I don't want to do that again.  I fucking fell asleep.  Yeah.  I don't want to put anybody to sleep again.  No, it wasn't you.  It wasn't you.  It was the, uh.  No, that was probably fucking, uh, my gray goose disease. 
[03:10:30]  I think it called it.  Gray goose disease.  Yeah, yeah.  That could fucking.  It's like walking into the movie The Hangover.  Yeah, I was a little sleepy that time.  Yeah, that was when I put the mic in front of my face and, uh, listened to me going,  Oh, you were asleep.  That's right.  I was fucking conked right out during the show.  You look healthier now.  Well, yeah.  I, uh, decided, um, you know, to actually, uh, go to the gym and, um, work right, eat right,  and, uh.  Yeah.  Cut back on the drinking. 
[03:11:00]  You know, the drinking.  Isn't it weird when you get healthy, you start talking to guys who juice about juicers?  Like, that's what I talk about.  One guy used to talk about it.  I said, I don't want to hear this.  You know, I'm like, because of my health, I'm like, I'm juicing, and I, I found out  about the juicer, and the bartender goes, you want to try my special concoction of what  I've juiced from the house?  I'm like, I'd love to, and I love this conversation, and I want to, I want to slash my throat.  I know.  Yeah.  You can find plenty of women out there with slashed throats these days.  Yeah, well, they just, uh, put one away, I guess. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  And I was reading about this other woman who slashed her baby's throat.  That was the guy's daughter, yeah.  Yeah, the guy's daughter that kidnapped those three girls.  Yeah.  He's fucking, she was a lunatic, too.  What a great house.  Yeah.  What a great household.  Yeah.  I didn't get a chance to be lonely, but there were like three girls kidnapped or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Had a kid, had a kid with one.  Yeah.  He was just raping them and fucking, keeping them locked in the house.  How do you live like that?  How do you get okay with that?  I know it's a childhood thing.  I don't know.  Or it's an electron thing. 
[03:12:00]  It must be an electrode thing.  Like one crazy synapse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That makes you do things like that.  I'm kind of jealous, though.  That's fucking, that'd be nice to just look at a girl and go, I want her, and then you  just take her.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking great.  Like, you're going to the store.  You're coming with me.  Yeah, fuck it.  How do you, how do you live with yourself?  Like, how do you go to the store, or how do you ever moralize to anybody when you know  you have fucking three kidnapped victims chained up in your house?  How are you not just thinking of that every fucking second of the day?  You think he's judging people?  Like, oh, I can't believe that person's- 
[03:12:30]  Oh, what an asshole that guy is.  Bush lied to the country.  You know, he's got three girls tied up.  Yeah, I used to, I really wonder, like I used to say, and the audience gets behind it at  the end, but they really have to, they don't want to think about it, is when a priest is  blowing like a six-year-old kid, when does it not become okay, the priest, and when does  he say, but I'll still go further, when his nose touches the belly of a six-year-old boy, 
[03:13:00]  does he ever go like my, like, does he look at him and go, like, look how tiny it is?  Jesus.  It doesn't look interesting when it's tiny, I would imagine, but he goes, look how tiny  it is.  No, I should never.  And then he just keeps going.  Like, how does he make that okay in his fucking head?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  From looking, and from wanting, to all of a sudden doing.  And when does it stop, when does he go like, this tastes like shit, it's a six-year-old,  six-and-quarter-inch penis.  I can have M&M's. 
[03:13:30]  I mean, why can't he make the switch?  Yeah, yeah, I don't know how people go to that next step to actually doing things.  How do you co-sign that in your own mind, you know, I'm going to make myself do this.  How does your consciousness happen?  How do you pass by a mirror after that, and like, look at it, be like, oh boy.  I've had some great jack-off sessions where I couldn't even look in the mirror, like,  ugh, don't even look at you, what I was fantasizing about.  Like, lotions I was using.  Fucking machinery. 
[03:14:00]  Go, baby, go, keep going.  Oh, God, enough.  Machinery.  Oh, fuck, you creep.  Don't say, you go to wash your hands, but I pull the hat brim over my eyes so I don't  have to look in the mirror.  Yeah.  Just a creep.  There's nothing worse than when you think about what you were just thinking about while  you still have cum on the back of your knuckles.  Yeah.  And it's not yours.  Yeah.  You're like, what was I just thinking about?  And priests must orate louder to shut the voices out in their heads.  Like, I just, three, six-year-old, I just, and the Lord said, he's got to drown those 
[03:14:30]  sick voices out.  Yeah.  Yeah, the louder you talk about good things, the fucking, maybe the bad things are shut  down a little bit.  Well, yeah, that's, uh, the people, the people that argue and complain about certain debauchery  the most are even more attracted to that kind of a thing, it seems.  What are you promoting, by the way?  Um, because we are ending the show, um, in one minute.  Oh, look at the time.  He's a stand-up tonight. 
[03:15:00]  I'm flying to Utah.  Oh, nice.  He's a stand-up New York tonight at, uh, 11 o'clock.  Uh, his website's got the book, uh, free tracks, uh, the t-shirt that we're trying to raise  awareness through a little bit of humor, um, Ricky's tagline.  He's a new cool and Parkinson's t-shirt.  So rickshapiro.tv.  And listen, Catalyst for Change is my new CD.  And Unfilter's his book.  Unfilter is a new book that has no rules in it.  I think anybody who wants to explore it would love the book. 
[03:15:30]  And it's, everything's through his website.  Cool.  And stand up New York tonight.  Come on and see him.  How long are you in New York for?  Till Sunday.  Or Saturday.  Saturday.  All right, man.  Thanks for coming in.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks for having me.  That's all right.  Good to see you, Jimmy.  Good to see you, Jimmy.  Kick that shit's ass, and, uh, we'll let you back in.  Definitely.  I leave today.  Uh, I'll be at Wise Guys in Utah tomorrow and Saturday.  And I guess we'll, uh, Anthony, any plugs? 
[03:16:00]  Uh, yeah, uh, Ratgut.  Hey, hey, uh, Banzel, uh, get back together there at, um, Mexicali Live in New Jersey.  Um, I'll, I'll, you know, on my brother's fucking face.  But what do you want from me?  I'll just be there.  I just show up.  All right.  Take it easy, everybody.  I'll see you tomorrow, Friday.  Yeah.  All right.  See you later.  Oh, yeah, I'm done.  The Opie and Anthony show is available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it. 
[03:16:30]  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After Opie and Anthony, life is coming up.  Wait, wait.  Was that an intro for Opie and Anthony live?  No, for after Opie and Anthony live.  That's what I mean.  That was an intro for after Opie and Anthony live?  It's the, it's how your show ends and goes.  So why the fuck am I doing this read?  It's now Sam's show.  I don't do live reads on Sam's show. 
[03:17:00]  Well, the technique is yours.  You still got two more.  All right.  I'll wing it.  Steven Singer.  Ah, look what you did there.  Oh, you switched it up.  No, I didn't.  Bye, guys.  Take it easy.  See you later, man.  Take care, man.  Absolutely, man.  Kicky Ace.  Kicky Ace.  What were we talking about?  Oh, Steven Singer.  Steven Singer.  Take this advice from your good pals here at, after Opie and Anthony live. 
[03:17:30]  Not yet.  Well, he, E-Rock played the fucking intro.  Well, he did the wrong thing.  Yeah, apparently so.  It's just not a huge stretch.  He got all fucking excited when he heard the Mayo Clinic.  All right, Anthony, how many times?  I did show your crutch.  I know.  Whenever you get uncomfortable, you have to start making E-Rock jokes.  Fuck, it was so uncomfortable.  I'm not the kind of guy.  I can't. 
[03:18:00]  What is it?  I'm not, like, look face to face with adversity guy.  I don't know how to handle things like that.  You know, I don't know what to do.  I get queasy when people talk about certain things.  I get, ah, I'm a hypochondriac.  I'm like, ah, I got it.  I don't want to catch.  Ah, I'm going to catch something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You made the crank at E-Rock about dopamine and everybody was just like, what would I do?  Dopamine.  See, I don't know what to do. 
[03:18:30]  That's not where we were going.  We were just trying to talk to a guy.  I know.  Goddamn lucky Opie today.  Lucky Opie took the day off for his little boy's birthday party.  Hi, Jimmy.  I'll see you guys.  Oh, you're wearing a Captain America thing.  I was goofing on the guys.  Oh, yeah, that's funny.  Grow up.  I was goofing on somebody on Twitter.  Some asshole on Twitter.  Had a Captain America shield avatar picture.  And I was like, how fucking old are you? 
[03:19:00]  And then I look over at Jimmy's gut sweatshirt with the little guy.  I'm just a little guy.  You are, though.  Poor Rick.  You're just, ah, gosh.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  You're just calling out Ant for being uncomfortable.  I can't deal with real time.  And making E-Rock jokes because he was uncomfortable.  Yeah, but I want to talk to him.  He's a really funny comic.  And people know him from Lucky Louie.  And he's been a friend for years.  And he's just having this fucking, that's what life is, man.  It's sad.  Life is terrible.  But I'm happy that he doesn't have the devastating kind.  That is actually really good news. 
[03:19:30]  I hope he gets better.  Yeah, he probably will.  I mean, we're seeing him now in these early stages.  But for all you Lucky Louie fans and stuff, it's just sad to see Rick going through this.  He did the virus tour, too.  He did a couple of the big shows.  Yeah, he did.  The big shows, yeah?  Yep.  I remember that.  All right, guys.  Oh, boy.  Can you put this in the office and I'll take it Monday?  Oh, no, I'll just bring it.  You just steal it.  You're right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Singer Jewelers for Mother's Day.  You know, everybody, someday, look at your mom. 
[03:20:00]  Someday she's going to be dead.  Oh.  There's no way around it.  There's no way around it.  Shit.  What are you going to do now while she's alive?  Treat her like shit or get her a gold-covered rose?  Guess I'm going to get her a rose.  Before you have to lay that single rose on her casket, why not get her a gold-dipped rose? 
[03:20:30]  How about asking Stephen Singer if maybe after your mom drops dead you can dip her in gold and have, like, the rose, but now you have mom.  She lasts forever.  You can display her, and you can collect her with the rest of your aging family in years to come.  Make a bouquet of your relatives.  We have the technology.  Yes.  That would be great.  Oh, my God.  I'm still here doing this.  It's not even for the gold rose. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, it's the Argentian Mother and Child diamond necklace.  Oh, but you know what?  If you want to get the rose for Mother's Day anyway, get that for $69.  If you want the Argentian Mother and Child diamond necklace, it's just $149.  So if you're shopping for your mom, your wife, mother-in-law, Stephen makes it easy for you.  To treat that someday-going-to-be-dead mom of yours.  I'm sorry, but it's the truth.  It's the hard, hard truth of this awful world. 
[03:21:30]  The beautiful necklace, it's going to make mom really happy.  And perhaps it would be a very special moment if after she's dead, she's wearing that super silver Argentian Mother and Child diamond necklace.  When you step up to that casket to say your last goodbye, pat her little hand, weep a bit, you could look down and go,  Hey, look, they put that super silver Argentian Mother and Child diamond necklace on.  And literally, it will be a gift that lasts forever because, you know. 
[03:22:00]  It's it for her.  That's it.  That's her necklace.  So, my friends, overnight shipping in time for Mother's Day, if you order by 5 p.m. today, don't fuck it up.

I think, well, a lot of people were saying that their presets automatically switched.  Automatically switched?  Yeah.  It automatically, like when you got in your car this morning and hit that preset for O&A,  it went to the proper channel.  Yeah.  A lot of people were saying that.  They were supposed to.  All that whining and crying and bitching we did about the channel change.  And on 105 is a non-stop loop saying that we're over at 103. 
[03:24:30]  Oh!  That's handy.  Yeah.  Kind of like that.  This is EW hasn't started yet.  When does that start?  When does that big kick off?  The end of the month.  End of the month.  Great.  All right.  What the fuck?  I'm going home.  I'm going to hop in the car.  I'm going to listen to Sam Roberts in the after show.  Then, by the time I get home, which is probably going to be a little before 11, 
[03:25:00]  I'm going to crawl into bed, turn on the TV, pull the covers up, and go nappy.  That's nice.  Yeah.  That's got to be nice.  We have a meeting today, so I want to have the same fate.  Sam, let me tell you.  It's so nice to just go to sleep in the middle of the day.  It's going to be like a fucking middle of the day piece of shit.  The morning's not even over yet.  I know!  It's amazing.  It's got to be.  All right.  Is that it?  I think so.  That's it for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:25:30]  But stay tuned for the Sam Roberts after show featuring the likes of E-Rock.  Hopefully.  Troy Kwan.  Yeah.  Roland.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe it was the and as on your show.  You know, with the credits in the 80s, it was and so-and-so as, you know, and Tom Bosley  as Mr. Cunningham.  I guess and intern Alan as Alan Thicke Jr.  All right.  Right?  That works. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Although that's kind of usually the big start.  He fucked up Royal today.  Maybe we'll get to the bottom of the tissue thing.  Tissues he fucked up.  And then, for some reason, when I was walking in, before we went to Colin Quinn segment on  the show, I was walking in the studio and Alan Thicke Jr. was opening the studio door  and walking backwards out the door, which he walked right into me.  I'm like, whoa, whoa.  And he walks right into me because he decided, for some reason, to exit the studio backwards.  We had to look in amazement at everything that was going on in here in front of his eyes. 
[03:26:30]  Just fucking turn around and face the door.  He was looking to see if he was needed.  Yeah.  For, obviously, on air or something.  I know you guys are going to be back from break soon, so.  Is everything good here?  He's only got two days left on his internship.  Is that it?  Well, this is, and tomorrow is his last day.  Wow.  So he's in that sort of last couple days panic.  I got to get some air time.  I got to get.  And I've heard him talking with Troy Kwan on the air and how Troy does this wonderful 
[03:27:00]  thing with people.  He berates them.  Yeah.  Calls them absolute pieces of shit.  They're useless.  They don't have work ethic.  They're fucking by.  But, you know, I like the kid.  I like him as a person.  Right.  Like, he deflects it like, no, you're a good person.  You're just a complete incompetent piece of shit.  And then at the end of the conversation, Troy's always been a good guy.  Troy's a good guy.  Right, right.  No, no, but he's a good guy.  You know, yeah.  Then there's this love fest.  Let's go, please.  I got a plane to catch. 
[03:27:30]  Thanks.  Oh, I'm sorry, Kenny.  Kenny, look at me.  I forgot.  Okay.  Kenny, Kenny.  If you can hear me on the radio, Kenny, I'm coming down right now.  All right.  Over.  Over and out.  All right.  You can't talk back.  Sam Roberts next.  Okay.  Feel like telling someone to fuck off.  Fuck you.  Hey, fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah.  Fuck you, too.  866-FU line 1.  What's your name?  Fuck you.  That's my name.  That's 866-FU line 1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[03:28:00]  Fuck you.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Fuck you.  I want to say fuck you.  I'm like pancreas.  And if your call doesn't suck, it just might make you out of here.  Fuck you.  You're cool.  Fuck you.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right.  You have to bear with me today.  Why are you scowling, you rock? 
[03:28:30]  No, just my headphones.  I must have levels up too loud here.  You just sound like you pop.  No, I don't think so.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  The only thing I pop is bottles.  You know how I do.  In the club?  That's right.  In the club.  That was a good Opie and Anthony show today.  Good to hear from Ray.  You have to bear with me a little bit.  Obviously, my body's falling apart this week.  I was out on Tuesday.  You had to miss the wonderful After Opie and Anthony Live radio show on Tuesday. 
[03:29:00]  Because on Monday night, my body decided that nothing should be inside of it.  That anything that is ingested should be repelled immediately.  To the point where I was sucking an ice cube at one point.  I started throwing up in the evening at like 6.30.  Just in time for Jess to get home.  So she could see me in a vulnerable state. 
[03:29:30]  It's not a very manly or masculine position for your woman to see you hugging a porcelain throne.  Just kneeling beside it.  And hoping that your body finally expels what you feel like it should have been expelling for the last hour and a half.  And then I thought everything was out of me.  I threw up everything that was in my body.  And then I started trying to rehydrate a little bit.  But every 20 minutes, I had to run back to the toilet bowl. 
[03:30:00]  To the point where, okay, I just threw up a whole bunch again.  So what am I going to do?  Have a little bit of Gatorade.  Rehydrate. Electrolytes. Blah, blah, blah.  Have a little sip of Gatorade.  Back in a bowl.  A sip.  Not a chug.  A quick sip.  It got so bad.  It got so bad that I was sucking on an ice cube.  Because I guess my mother-in-law said to my wife, you know, one thing that's good for sickness like that is sucking on an ice cube. 
[03:30:30]  Because it's nice cold water, rehydrating, and also the act of sucking on an ice cube.  I said, if you believe that, I got something for you to suck on.  I didn't say that.  But she said the act of sucking on an ice cube.  So I was sucking on an ice cube.  I threw up an ice cube.  Iraq, have you ever thrown up an ice cube?  No.  I threw up an ice cube. 
[03:31:00]  You should.  Everybody has their remedies.  But I know what works for me.  Sometimes it's just regular ginger ale.  Nothing, dude.  Like, I was not even ginger ale.  I was on seltzer water.  I couldn't drink fizzy water.  It's just H2O with some extra carbonation in it.  And I threw it up.  A sip of it.  It took me about 15 minutes to get into my body.  And then, boom, back in the toilet.  It was disgusting.  And then, Sam, and now my voice is just... 
[03:31:30]  And then yesterday, I started building up a cough.  Now my voice is shot.  My body's falling apart on me.  I don't know what to do about it.  I don't...  I know I've tried ginger ale or whatever,  but none of that stuff actually works when you're just sick.  And I didn't have food poisoning.  I was just sick.  And now I've got a whole other sickness.  My throat wasn't sore before.  I didn't have a cough before.  This is two different sicknesses.  It's not fair. 
[03:32:00]  It's one after the other.  Are you sure it wasn't something you ate?  No, it wasn't something I ate.  I don't eat anything weird.  Throwing up usually doesn't just show up and surprise you like that.  I had, like, I think, like a 12-hour bug.  I ate, like, a peanut butter sandwich and a banana.  There was nothing food-poison-y about it.  And then, if it was food poisoning,  that shit would have been out of me  because I was expelling my entire stomach.  And then it's not like, you know, 
[03:32:30]  whatever's in there would just linger.  It was gone.  By the time I was throwing up ice cubes,  my stomach was empty aside from the ice cubes.  Then, last night I'm up all night coughing.  That's why my voice sounds like this now.  It's probably a little more manageable, actually,  when my voice sounds like this.  You sound like a man.  Thank you very much.  It's about time.  Maybe I should cut a demo for Entertainment Weekly now.  You think I'd have a better shot?  I think so.  You know how women, when you get,  when guys get cold and they sound like you do right now? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  Women think they sound sexy.  You think so?  Like a little bass?  You should get Nicole in here to review it.  No, that's not a bad idea.  Can you go get Nicole?  Yeah, of course.  Why not?  Let her know.  Hey.  She's going.  I am a man after all.  I'm not one of your girlfriends,  which I assume that you've always thought I was.  I desperately want to get back on Channel 105,  so I think this may be my ticket.  If I cut an Entertainment Weekly demo like this,  it's gold.  Well, right now there's nothing but two promos running back-to-back. 
[03:33:30]  What are the two promos?  One announcing that Entertainment Weekly radio will start on the 28th,  and the other one saying,  hey, Opie and Anthony are on 103 in case you're looking for them.  Well, I mean,  I feel like I could give a little more content than that for sure.  You could argue what my value is,  but I feel like I could do a little more than that.  And then,  but this is what I'm saying.  I had the sickness of throwing up,  and then you couple that with,  now I can't talk and I'm up all night coughing.  It's two sicknesses. 
[03:34:00]  They're not supposed to be paired together like this.  I don't understand how this could happen.  It's not like one led to the other.  It's just one started when the other finished.  I was done.  I had my little 12-hour bug,  a little insect,  and then this thing starts.  It doesn't seem rational.  Brad in Mississippi.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Sammy, if you were down here in South Mississippi,  we would apply leeches.  It would suck the venom right out of you. 
[03:34:30]  At this point, I'm willing to try anything.  Oh, I forgot to tell you.  Slammy!  That's exactly right.  Thank you very much, Brad.  No, it's not.  What do you mean not?  No, it's not.  Both leeches and that are both wrong.  Uh-huh.  Larry in Kansas.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Well, Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  I'm sorry you were feeling so under the weather,  but because you are Sam Roberts,  you're still going to do a show.  Yeah.  Because you know we couldn't stand it  if we didn't have Sam Roberts on the radio. 
[03:35:00]  And I'm also pretty glad  you did make the jump to 103  to prop those guys up.  They seemed so worried about their audience  that I know that they needed you  to put them over the top.  Yeah, I decided to help them out.  Hey, you're just a generous guy.  Yeah.  And as a good home remedy on the stomach trouble,  if you take rosemary out of your kitchen,  just the plain herb rosemary,  you'll be amazed at what it will do 
[03:35:30]  to settle a stomach.  I've given it to guys that were suffering  with food poisoning,  been barking for 12 hours,  and in 20 minutes,  it's like they had no symptoms at all.  It's really, really amazing.  Thanks, Larry.  I couldn't get it to you before then.  That's all right.  I'm always a day late.  I know, but I'm a listener, Sammy.  I'm always a day late and a dollar short.  That's exactly right.  Thank you, Larry.  It is a pay service.  I'll talk to you later.  I don't think rosemary would afford it.  I'm telling you,  at one point,  Jess was like, 
[03:36:00]  okay, here's what you do.  I got ice pops here.  How about just a raspberry ice pop?  Not a fancy one with ice cream in the middle.  Not one with berries sticking out of it.  Just a regular ice pop.  I go, perfect.  It's something delicious.  It'll get my blood sugar up.  It'll hydrate me a little bit.  I'm going to tell you this, though.  It was one of those Edie's fruit bars.  I love those.  And they kind of taste just as good coming back up.  Most things...  I'm going to tell you this, Eric. 
[03:36:30]  Most, like, Gatorade coming back up  is the worst thing in the world.  Like, that was horrible.  That was enough for me to be like,  I don't need electrolytes in my life ever again.  That was horrible.  But most things,  when they come back up,  you're like,  well, I'm never going to eat that again.  It's very acidic.  Right.  But,  I don't know.  Those Edie's fruit bars,  especially the raspberry one,  I was like,  it's still delicious.  I mean,  I'm not going to keep it in my mouth.  I'm not going to savor it. 
[03:37:00]  I recognize that,  you know,  it's now mixed with stomach bile  and this isn't healthy.  And I don't want to disgust anybody.  I don't want to gross anybody out.  But I'm telling you,  it was still delicious.  And that does say something about your product.  And I think it says something about the fact,  I think it's natural.  That's an endorsement.  Yeah,  I don't think there's a lot of preservatives in there.  Because otherwise,  once you started to digest,  everything would change.  Everything would be all different.  I didn't want to,  I didn't want to gross everybody out  and talk about sickness, 
[03:37:30]  but I felt like I couldn't not acknowledge the fact  that I sound like this.  Have you ever been in a scenario,  E-Rock,  where you get two sicknesses,  one after the other?  Uh,  I don't think,  no,  because usually if I get sick,  I get really sick.  Yeah,  that's what's supposed to happen.  I don't usually just get,  no,  oh,  I'm having a little cold or something.  It goes from perfectly fine to bronchitis  or to something like that.  I got bronchitis.  Um,  and what am I going to do now?  I was singing this morning. 
[03:38:00]  I was in the shower.  I was like,  I feel like shit,  but I'm going,  what am I going to do?  On Monday night,  I called the bosses and said,  look,  I'm feeling really shitty.  Uh,  you know,  I'm not holding anything down.  I'm not going to be in tomorrow.  And they said you were full of shit.  Well,  they go,  okay,  feel better,  Sam,  feel better.  What am I going to do now?  Wednesday morning,  be like,  sorry guys,  I have a sore throat.  I'm not coming in.  I thought you had stomach problems,  Sam.  They check your Twitter,  your Facebook to see if you were out that night.  Right, 
[03:38:30]  right.  And then,  and then last night I posted a podcast because I was feeling a little better last night and that would have fucked me royally.  Royally.  Uh,  Manuel in Oakland.  What am I making?  How are you doing,  buddy?  Hey,  you think that the little Oaksher probably got you a fit?  I don't know.  I saw,  I was hanging out with Obie's kid,  uh,  over the weekend because Obie had a birthday party for him and he didn't seem sick to me. 
[03:39:00]  Uh,  we played rocket ships.  Everything seemed fine.  He was active in the game.  Uh,  and I don't know.  He might've gotten me halfway there,  but I don't think he had both of these sicknesses.  I don't know which one he could have given me though.  Were you at the party?  Did you dress as a pirate?  I didn't dress up as a pirate.  No,  I didn't go,  I didn't go to the party itself.  I went to the after party,  which was at like two o'clock in the afternoon.  Are you hanging up on me?  Can I get a mixtape?  Yeah,  for sure.  For sure. 
[03:39:30]  I'll put you on hold.  Yeah.  I think he only could have gotten me halfway there because I was,  I was hanging out with that kid.  He didn't seem sick.  And to my knowledge,  he wasn't puking.  So it's like,  come on.  Let me go.  By the way.  Yeah.  The guy that,  uh,  wanted the mixtape.  Yeah.  The intern picked up and called Emmanuel.  Which intern?  Who do you think?  Was it intern Alan Thicc Jr.?  Yeah.  He called him Manuel?  He goes,  Manuel?  That's the one thing,  like even for a Spanish name. 
[03:40:00]  I don't think any Manuel has ever been thought of as manual.  Like as in like a,  like a,  like an instruction book?  Yeah,  exactly.  Oh God,  he's an idiot.  Phil in Charlotte.  Yeah,  Sam.  Yeah,  I've had food poisoning before and what you,  what you're describing sounds a lot like food poisoning.  Did you feel,  uh,  sick leading up to the vomiting?  Like when you get,  when you get a bug,  you kind of feel it coming on.  Did you go through that stage?  Here's what happened.  I was run down on Monday. 
[03:40:30]  I was just feeling run down.  I thought this sore throat thing was coming.  And I was like,  okay,  let me rest.  I'll eat some food.  I'll hydrate.  I'll drink some juices,  all that good shit.  Right.  And then I sit down on the couch.  I start drinking orange juice and I start eating cheese and crackers.  And I don't know what it was,  but after that orange juice and cheese and crackers come,  come into play,  I start to feel sick.  Orange juice is not,  even though they say drink it when you're,  when you have a cold. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  It's not what you should be drinking,  especially if you,  if you know you're going to throw up.  Yeah.  I didn't know I had an upset stomach though.  And so I drank the orange.  Burns.  Even after it's out,  it's still burned.  Oh,  I mean,  are you kidding me?  I saw when I,  my first trip to the toilet,  I saw the three days where I saw three days worth of food.  I thought,  Oh,  there's a little muffin in there.  I see everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some raw potato in there.  That one still looks like it could have some crunch to it.  Adam in Detroit. 
[03:41:30]  But yeah,  but I don't think,  I don't think it was food poisoning.  Cause I didn't have anything weird.  Like when I say cheese and crackers,  I went to A and P and bought cracker barrel,  cracker cuts.  You know what I mean?  Like it wasn't,  it wasn't weird.  I think I was just,  I don't know.  Sick.  What's up,  Adam?  Hey man,  I was just wondering,  you know,  being sick and puke and all that,  whatever up bile and all that.  One of the things that made you throw raw and that's why you're coughing now.  So maybe these two sicknesses are a little bit more together than you thought,  you know?  I don't know,  dude.  Cause I swear to God last night I'm sitting there and I'm hacking, 
[03:42:00]  I'm coughing like croup cough,  horrible coughs.  And I,  and it's happening every three minutes.  I just keep coughing and I almost went into a panic attack thinking the  coughing is never going to stop.  Uh,  I'm never going to go to sleep.  I'm never going to get rested again.  I'm going to be run down for another show tomorrow.  Everything is going horribly.  Sometimes I think I let my mind get carried away with me.  Sometimes I think I'm just not mentally where I need to be at. 
[03:42:30]  Phillip in Oklahoma.  I want to welcome you to the first half of the show of one Oh three.  This is,  this is the one Oh three.  This is the one Oh three generation.  Uh,  it's a whole new ball game.  And I feel like moving this channel to one Oh three is going to make  everybody realize what a contender we really are.  Right.  And,  um,  I was wondering if I could get a mixtape.  I downloaded it.  That's all out of order and it won't input correctly. 
[03:43:00]  And I want the physical one.  If you don't mind.  Yeah.  I'm going to put you on hold and I,  we will send you a mixtape as well.  Who kid.  Everybody's wondering DJ who kid,  uh,  it was a frequent guest on after open Anthony live.  He's back in town.  So he should be back on the show.  One of these days.  Uh,  he put together a mixtape and it's all,  uh,  hip hop songs matched up with the songs that,  that they are sampling.  So,  you know,  it's,  it's the original song and then the rap song that samples that.  And it's hosted by Opie and Anthony and me. 
[03:43:30]  And,  uh,  I think there are shout outs to E-Rock and Roland and all the guys.  Have you heard it,  E-Rock?  Yes,  I have.  What'd you think of it?  That's great.  Nick in California.  Sam,  a couple of weeks ago,  didn't you,  uh,  try out for a,  uh,  a spot for entertainment weekly?  Yes,  I did.  And they didn't give you the job cause they didn't like your voice,  right?  That's exactly why they said I had the best demo of anybody that tried out.  And to anybody who works in this building who also tried out for, 
[03:44:00]  for,  for this gig that I didn't get,  I want you to know my demo was better than yours.  Unfortunately,  my voice is just not a pleasant sounding broadcast voice.  Go on,  Nick.  I think that you need to go try out again because the new thick Sam Roberts voice sounds more refined,  more mature,  more rich.  It's just better.  Maybe,  maybe you're right.  Thank you, 
[03:44:30]  Nick.  Troy,  you think this is a better broadcasting voice?  I like it.  You do?  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe I'll stick with it then.  Yeah,  a little more,  a little more gravel.  You know what you need to do is you need to start smoking some cigarettes.  You think so?  Jigging some Jack Daniels.  Yeah.  Because it kind of gives you a little more like edge.  A little grit.  A little grit.  Some manliness.  A better timber.  I feel like I don't,  maybe I don't come across with enough machismo.  Nah,  sometimes it doesn't sound,  it sounds like your balls didn't even drop yet.  Really?  Yeah.  That's not the,  it's not what I want to get out there.  Right.  That's not the image I want to get.  And you're real nasally. 
[03:45:00]  You might want to think about some sinus surgery.  Well,  you did.  How did it go?  Great.  And your nose looks fantastic,  by the way.  Thank you.  And I can breathe better than ever.  I wanted to tell you that DJ Who Kid,  we were talking about the mixtapes a minute ago.  E-Rock,  did you watch SmackDown on Friday?  No,  I'm a little behind.  I got to watch it on the DVR.  I got some tweets about this.  I heard about this.  I might have had a hand in it,  maybe.  But listen,  you know,  Troy,  you're not a wrestling guy,  but Fandango,  of course,  you know by now.  Well,  the Opie and Anthony Fandango connection 
[03:45:30]  continues to grow.  Okay.  Listen to Fandango's entrance  on SmackDown on Friday.  We're in Detroit.  The Kid Rocks Fandango.  And his opponent,  Fandango.  Now the world-renowned DJ Zabiche  and DJ Who Kid  have been sampling  Fandango's theme  in clubs from New York  to Los Angeles.  We don't know what  Fandango thinks of that.  I'm sure he's not happy.  I don't know if that's true. 
[03:46:00]  I don't know.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Pretty cool, though, right?  Yeah.  On SmackDown,  announcing that DJ Who Kid  has been sampling  Fandango's theme  in the clubs.  Yeah.  We'll have to get him in here  to find out if that's true.  Yeah.  But that was,  I mean,  and if there's any wonder  as to whether or not,  you know,  people at this show  might have had something  to do with it.  Half of the WWE broadcast team  has been on  after Opie and Anthony Live  before.  Yes.  Maybe.  Maybe I had a hand in it.  Slightly.  Is Who Kid  even a wrestling fan? 
[03:46:30]  No, I mean,  Who Kid's a fan  of everything  but might be a fan of him.  Right.  So once he finds out  WWE is shouting him out,  he's into it.  He's into it.  Yeah.  He'll wear the Fandango shirts.  Yeah, he'll wear  a Fandango shirt,  especially if he can  make a couple bucks  doing it.  Yeah.  You know,  he don't wear a t-shirt.  Who Kid's the type of guy,  I don't know if you know this,  like you and I,  we shop at a store,  we pay for shirts  and then we wear them.  Yeah.  Who Kid doesn't pay for shirts?  Who Kid gets paid  to wear shirts.  And I don't think  Who Kid ever repeats a shirt.  No, 
[03:47:00]  unless he gets paid to.  Right.  If somebody's like,  can you wear my shirt again?  He's like, yeah,  for money, I'm assuming.  And they're like,  okay, here you go.  I need that hookup.  Yeah, well,  I mean,  you need that visibility.  Yeah, I know.  You know,  you need to be in pictures  for 50 Cent.  You need to be on MTV Cribs.  Yeah.  You ever see  the Who Kid version  of MTV Cribs?  No.  He's such a liar.  It obviously was not  where he lives.  It was 50 Cent's crib  and Who Kid was in there,  I guess,  saying that he lived  in 50 Cent's guest house.  Yeah.  And he moved the cushions  off the couch  and said that's where  he keeps his big, 
[03:47:30]  giant,  shady necklace.  It's ridiculous.  Robert in Birmingham.  How are you doing, Sam?  Good.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I love you.  I listen to your Sunday show  and call in  and listen to you  on this thing  that's after that  little amateur show  before you.  Right.  But you want to be on TV  and I think you ought to be,  but you don't want to cut  that silly hair.  And you want to be  in your own radio  but you don't go 
[03:48:00]  to a vocal coach  to try to move  your voice down  out of your head  and more into your chest.  No.  Come on, buddy.  I want to see you everywhere.  I want you to take over media.  Yeah, but you know what?  I don't want  to take over media  as a shell  that someone's created.  If I'm going to take over media,  if I'm going to take over media,  okay,  I'm going to take over media.  Not some douchebag  who's training me  to sound like Ryan Seacrest.  Me.  You don't have to sound like,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[03:48:30]  Hey.  Listen.  Hey.  Singers take vocal lessons  not just to learn  the pitches and stuff  but to have a better timbre  of their,  a better vocal quality  to sound.  It's not being spake.  It's just having better.  The quality.  Being up here,  being up here,  it's not a,  that's not where you want to be.  The quality  of what I say,  the quality  of the sounds  that my vocal cords make  are so valuable,  is so valuable,  that it's worth 
[03:49:00]  whatever the sound is.  And people get used to it.  People like  a recognizable voice.  And Eastside Dave  may say  some really funny stuff,  but he's,  he's going to be known  as the guy  that sticks stuff  up his butt  and screams  drunken stuff  on the radio.  Well, I mean,  that's Eastside Dave.  Take him seriously.  I mean,  that's Eastside Dave.  I think we're in,  you know,  a couple separate camps.  But, Robert,  I appreciate the advice,  but I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to sit there.  I know you're not.  I'm not going to do it.  I know you're not.  That's why you're going to be here.  And I hate that, Sam,  because I want you to go 
[03:49:30]  and spread your wings, buddy.  All right.  Thank you, Robert.  You're trying to go  for the road  less traveled by,  and that's fine.  Yeah.  It's harder.  It's harder.  It's a rocky road.  And if it works,  the reward is a lot richer.  You know what Jay-Z once said?  What's that?  I reached the fork in the road,  and I went straight.  That's some fucking crazy shit.  Yeah.  Nobody goes straight.  It's not even a road that way.  It's trees.  But he's one in a million, though.  So am I, Troy.  Well,  so is Sam Robertson.  You know that.  Then you've got to do it.  You know that in your heart.  I know you're a talented dude. 
[03:50:00]  You know that.  I know you're a talented dude.  I told you, though.  I don't think you should be  looking to this place  as you're fucking,  this is going to be  the answer  at all your prayers.  I'm looking all over the place.  Oh, good.  That's what you need to be doing.  I've got eyes everywhere.  Dr. Mike in Naples.  Yes, Sam.  Good morning.  Yes, I believe  you may have obtained  some fecal matter  from Opie's son  who may have been  digging in the back of his drawers  while you were playing  Rocket Ship.  He didn't put his hands 
[03:50:30]  in my mouth.  No, no, not at all.  But you were eating crackers  and having orange juice  not long after that.  I don't know what he's talking about.  He's going for something.  It wasn't working for me.  Was it working for you?  No.  Okay.  Did I make the right call?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Steven in Nashville.  Hey, Sam.  I just want to tell you  that last guy  before the last guy  talking about fecal matter.  Right.  But the guy talking  about the timbre of your voice,  man, that's crazy, dude.  Do you think he works  for Entertainment Weekly?  No.  Fuck that.  No, you're doing a great job, man.  You're changing history 
[03:51:00]  and shit, man.  Thank you.  So you just stick  with what you do, man.  I don't know about that.  All right, Steve.  What do you mean  you don't know about that?  What history are you changing?  I'm changing the history  of, you know,  you can't sound  like a fucking little douchebag  to be on the radio.  Oh, yes, you can.  Well, I'm breaking mold.  There's plenty of douchebags  on the radio.  Like, name one.  Like all those people  with those fake,  sticky voices.  But that's what  they want me to do.  No, I just think  that they want you to talk  at, like,  I'm just, like,  not so nasally.  That's how I talk.  I know it's how you talk.  Actually, this isn't 
[03:51:30]  how I talk.  I'm sick.  Right.  You sound better now, though.  You prefer it.  You start punching myself  in the throat.  I'm telling you, man,  start smoking cigarettes  and drinking Jack Daniels.  Eating up acorns  and pine cones  and stuff like that.  Go out,  go outside  and just start screaming.  Screaming on the top  of your lungs.  Like, shred your vocal cords  and then smoke cigarettes.  Maybe I should,  or should I start,  like, a hardcore band?  Yeah.  And be a singer.  It's like,  this is my voice  that's fucked up right now.  Because?  I was working on some vocals  on my new project.  And you're a hardcore singer.  Yeah.  Maybe that's what I need to do. 
[03:52:00]  Just find some place  where I could scream.  Plus,  it probably helps  vent a lot of frustrations.  Oh, you're not kidding.  You're not kidding.  I wouldn't think so.  Speaking of frustrated,  I'm a little frustrated  with the clips that are counting.  Really?  Yeah,  he was just giving me  a hard time today.  In what way?  Well, because I'm going  to Cancun tonight.  What, tonight?  Yeah.  Aren't you worried?  I saw traffic  the other day.  Yeah.  I wouldn't go to Mexico  if I were you.  Well, and he keeps talking  about all these behaviors.  He's like,  you're going to get beheaded. 
[03:52:30]  You're going to get beheaded.  Okay, well, I mean,  I was kidding.  You know, I don't think...  Are you going to Cancun?  Like, are you just going to  land and then figure out  your shit when you get there?  No, we're going to a resort.  But I said I want to go  on a moped  and go look for tacos.  Yeah, that's not a good idea.  That's not a great idea.  Why is that?  And you're hearing that  from E-Rock.  E-Rock,  if there's one thing  you like more than tacos,  it's mopeds, correct?  I never thought of that,  but sure.  You love both those things.  Like, E-Rock is the type of guy,  that's a motherfucker  you would see on a moped,  and that's a motherfucker  you would definitely 
[03:53:00]  see at a taco stand.  And he's telling you...  All right, we get  where you're going with this.  And he, I mean,  he loves food, you know?  Tacos.  Yeah.  Lots and lots of tacos.  I love tacos, too.  Yeah, but not like...  Shut up, we get it.  All right.  All right, all right.  We're trying to save  Troy's life here.  You're right.  I lost focus.  About me and my eating habits.  Yeah, but they just  don't behead you  for going and getting tacos.  No, but here's the thing.  You are gringo.  That's right.  I'm gringo loco.  A couple years ago, Troy,  I went down there  to a resort in Cancun.  You have a... 
[03:53:30]  When you get to the main highway,  there's military checkpoints  and escorts  to get you to the resort.  And this was a couple years ago.  Now, a few months ago,  we talked about a story  because you know how  Jim's obsessed with the cartels  in Mexico and all that, right?  They talked about a story  where somebody was at a resort  and just walked off the beach  at a resort in Cancun  and got killed.  Dude, eat the tacos  at the resort.  Yeah, but that's not  the authentic shit.  You have a tattoo  on your clavicle.  It says what? 
[03:54:00]  It says, uh,  Vida Loca.  You know what?  That is white faggot  in Spanish.  Like, that is not  what the Mexican people  want to see a guy like you  with on.  So you take your shirt off,  you're in your board shorts  and your flip-flops  riding around Mexico,  Tijuana.  Working on my tan.  Working on your tan  in a moped.  Hey, fellas,  where's a good taco place?  Get the fuck out of here, dude.  You can't drive around  in a moped looking for tacos.  I want tacos.  Especially now with,  your chick is hot.  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  And she's Mexican.  Yeah.  That's gonna piss  some people off down there.  Some gringo  with a fake-ass  Spanish tattoo  across his chest.  They're gonna think  you're, you know,  selling drugs or something.  No, they're gonna be like,  oh, look at the fucking...  He's down?  Yeah, he's cool.  He's one of us.  No, they're not gonna think that.  Because she'll say  some shit in Spanish  and be like, yo.  They're not gonna sneak that.  He's up on Whitey over here.  No.  No.  Don't behead him.  Yeah, don't behead him.  No lo tocas.  All right, gotta remember that.  What's that?  I mean, don't touch him.  All right.  Right?  And if you hear her say that, 
[03:55:00]  be like, okay, cool,  she's got my back.  Yeah, she knows what's up.  Or, fuck,  we're in a bad situation.  She shouldn't even have to say that.  Well, hopefully I have  a fast moped.  Yeah, it probably won't be  that fast  because they have cars in Mexico.  Yeah, but whatever.  They fucking...  I don't think they do.  And ziplines.  Aren't they all on fucking,  like, donkeys and shit?  And ziplines.  Or somebody ziplines down  and just snatches you up  while you're in a taco stand.  Oh.  Oh.  I want some fucking good tacos, man.  I understand,  but Taco Bell's got good tacos.  Nah, it's not that authentic shit, man. 
[03:55:30]  No, I know.  But we had authentic Mexican tacos  in the studio the other day.  I know.  You don't have to drive around  in a moped.  But you gotta go to the homeland.  No, you don't.  Yeah, you do.  That's where I'm going.  It's a bad idea.  Oh, we'll see.  The resort's gotta have  decent tacos, right?  I'll feel it out.  Yeah, you don't like...  How's the food at those resorts?  Are they good?  It's not bad.  Really?  I mean, but E-Rock loves food.  You know what I mean?  So why would I go to a...  spend all that money  to go to a shitty place  that has bad food?  Because he's just like,  whatever, just shovel it in my face.  No, that's not true.  Type of thing, you know?  It's just quantity, not quality. 
[03:56:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  They have a downtown area  that you can go out to clubs and shit.  So you gotta go out to that.  Yeah, that...  Yeah, because a club at night  in Mexico...  What the fuck are you talking about?  We can't go to a club in Mexico.  It's like a tourist thing.  No, you know what a tourist thing is?  What?  Inside the four walls of that resort.  That's fine.  That's fucking boring, man.  Okay, well, yeah,  you live an exciting life then.  It's gonna be very short.  When do you leave?  I leave tonight.  All right, so this is Troy's last show.  Thank you for being here.  Well, it's fun.  It's fun.  Life, you mean. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  Life, the show, hanging out.  Before you go to Mexico then,  you're gonna have to get  that Mother's Day present, right?  Right.  All right.  Time's running out.

Eric.  Hey, Sam.  I wanted to come to your defense  with the fanboy bitching about the timbre of your voice. 
[03:58:00]  Right.  And let you know that, you know,  the glass ceiling has already been broken  for people of your kind.  You know, Fez has been doing  hot-pitched announcements for some time.  In fact, I see a hot-pitched announcer role in your future.  You think that's where I'd be best suited,  just kind of sitting in the studio  and doing live reads and stuff?  Well, I think that the glass ceiling's been broken.  All right.  That's the fact, right?  Yeah, that's the path I'm following, Troy.  I don't need a lot of timbre.  I'm following the Fez path. 
[03:58:30]  Fez and I...  Fez is a great broadcaster.  Yeah.  That's the path I'm following.  Not the sexual stuff, though.  Oh.  Because he's also gay.  And I'm not gay.  I'm a married man.  Wow.  Beautiful woman.  Sometimes that's a cover-up.  Not this time, though.  I understand it's happened before  where there has been cover-ups.  Yeah.  It's not in this scenario.  I promise you that.  My wife and I have been physically intimate.  You love pussy.  Yes, I do.  Very much so.  Good man.  Good man, indeed.  Bob in Illinois. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  Sam, you don't need to cut your hair.  You don't need to change your voice.  Right.  What you need to start doing  is get a balanced diet.  This is the beginning of the end for you,  my friend.  That might be right.  You got stomach problems?  You're not even 30 years old yet, are you?  No.  It's terrible.  You got to start taking care of yourself, man.  That might be right.  I think I got to switch up some shit in the diet.  Yeah.  Start introducing some grown-up food,  is what I call it.  Start juicing.  I got to just start getting some food in me.  Yeah.  You know?  It's not chicken or pizza.  Dude, you can't have that hair, 
[03:59:30]  like, your whole life.  Well, I mean,  you're almost 30.  It's like, you know,  you get any older,  it's like,  you're going to look like fucking Richard Simmons.  You drive around on a fucking longboard.  But what does that have to do with hair?  Well, it has to do with looking fucking ridiculous  at a certain age.  Well, I mean,  hair is hair.  Skateboarding is exercise.  No, skateboarding looks fucking stupid.  And hair is hair, whatever.  I can cut that shit.  But you start thinning out a little bit up top,  you're going to look a little fucking...  You got a orangutan tattooed on your forearm. 
[04:00:00]  Don't worry about me.  I'm talking about your hair.  Well, I'm talking about you.  That's what you're going to do.  You're getting to 30 years old.  Yeah.  Like, your dad doesn't have a full head of hair,  does he?  Yeah, he has a very full head of hair.  What about your grandfather?  Not so much.  Okay, that's...  You might fucking lose your shit.  Maybe, but that's a bridge I'll cross when I get to it.  I'll reach the fork and go straight,  whatever that quote is that I said a minute ago.  You'll have, like, clown hair.  I'm not going to have clown hair.  You have fucking clown arms with your Vita Loca tattoo.  Don't worry about my shit. 
[04:00:30]  You're the one who looks like a fucking asshole  if it's one of us.  Marcus in Dallas with your TCB bullshit.  What's up, Marcus?  What's up, brother?  It's your appearance.  I mean, you're great on O&A,  but no one's going to take you seriously with that hair.  I'm identifiable.  I'm a character.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Get the fuck out of here.  No.  I'm tired of this guy.  What am I just...  Well, all right, fine.  I just look like everybody else,  and that should help things.  You look like every other jerk-off. 
[04:01:00]  Exactly.  You look like every other fucking jerk-off around here.  I like it.  I like your hair, dude.  You're going the harder road.  Yeah, I know.  So, like, when you're frustrated,  you just got to know, like,  you're taking the harder road.  But guess what?  It's going to mean a lot more.  Right, of course.  When I get there.  And it's going to last longer.  Yeah.  It's not going to be any of this bullshit part-time nonsense.  Right.  It's not going to be nobody handed me shit.  Right.  Ever.  What's up, Justin?  What's up, Sammy?  How you doing?  Good.  So, you really think people are going to fuck with Troy in Mexico?  Have you seen this motherfucker? 
[04:01:30]  Dude, people behead people in Mexico.  He looks like the stereotypical drug dealer freaking...  He's the man that goes down there to pick up the picker to pick the weed.  Are you going to have sunglasses on?  Of course.  That's not going to hurt.  Maybe some gold chains?  Two chains?  Good.  Two chains.  You going to be different?  I need one of those white, like a linen, cotton linen suit.  Yes.  With like a pink shirt open.  Yeah.  So, you can see my gold chains.  Hair slicked back. 
[04:02:00]  How many chains will you have?  Two.  Nice.  And then your hair slicked back and some sunglasses on?  Yeah.  That'll be at least a little bit safer for you.  Yeah.  Bring intern David in here.  It's his last day.  In the meantime, I got to tell you, Troy, you got to shape up before you go to Mexico.  You got to make sure you're looking smooth.  With your razor, when you do this, it doesn't need a vibrating handle.  It doesn't need a back scratcher.  It doesn't need 10 blades.  Seriously.  Have you noticed the price that you're paying for new razor blades?  David, how much?  Intern David.  Not the real intern David.  This is just intern Dave. 
[04:02:30]  How much, Dave, do you pay for new razor blades?  Probably 40 or 60.  It's how much?  Pesos.  Is that in pesos?  See, I can't do the catchphrase as well with my voice like this.  That sounds fun.  It was all right?  Yeah.  All right.  You're doing this every month for the rest of your life.  This is your Dollar Shave Club moment, and it's time for all the After Open Anthony Live  listeners who discovered dollarshaveclub.com.  Listen, here's what all the buzz is about.

[04:03:30]  And Intern Dave, we didn't hear from you much this semester.  Today's your last day.  Wanted to make sure we gave you a little shine before you go.  Is there anything you'd like to say?  Just learn some things.  What'd you learn?  I learned that generally it's a bad idea, I mean, to sleep at work.  Are you talking about Intern Allen?  Maybe.  I'm not going to name names.  I'm not going to figure it out.  He used his last moment to shit on Intern Allen.  Point fingers.  Well, you had a great internship.  Thank you for your hard work.  I always thought we did a great job. 
[04:04:00]  Troy?  Yeah.  I hope you survive this trip.  I'll be back.  E-Rock?  Tanned.  We'll go find some tacos someplace.  Is this for Dave or Troy?  Troy.  Troy.  All right, Troy.  I'm going to come back with a fucking belly full of tacos, motherfuckers.  Who's going to produce the I Will Remember You for you if you die?  It's not going to happen.  You sure?  I'm going to fucking tweet pictures of my tacos.  Do it.  And the middle finger's up to the cartel.  Troy Kwan, I don't say that.  I'm joking.  Terrible thing to say.  I don't agree.  Hugs for the cartel as far as I'm concerned. 
[04:04:30]  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye. </pre>
