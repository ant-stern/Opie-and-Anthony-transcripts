<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment centered on a baffling $10,000 fugitive promotion gone wrong at a radio station (92.3 Now FM).  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Sam Roberts, dissected the incredibly poor execution of the promotion, which involved an employee, Lisa Page, being forced to stand on the street with a sign professing her love for Barry Manilow (a claim she denied).  The thief, taunting the station, had filmed and posted this online.  The hosts were incredulous at the lack of media attention given to the theft, contrasting it with coverage of trivial celebrity news.  A caller claiming to be the "$5 Sirius 197 Fugitive" suggested multiple thefts were involved, adding to the chaos.  Opie and Anthony discussed their own history of "hacky" radio stunts, contrasting their rebelliousness with the corporate nature of the 92.3 Now FM debacle. They analyzed recordings of the fugitive's calls, press conferences (described as poorly produced), and security footage.  The fugitive provided cryptic clues – referencing their sushi preference, Facebook friends, Juilliard, and Google.  The hosts expressed frustration at the fugitive's evasiveness and listeners’ inability to solve the puzzle. A caller later suggested the money was hidden with mayonnaise.

The show transitioned to discussions about Tony Clifton’s upcoming appearance (and his demanding entourage), a news story about a drunken ninja impaled on a fence, and a *Curb Your Enthusiasm* episode featuring a Seinfeld reunion and an offensive Super Dave Osborne joke.  Opie and Anthony heavily criticized their Sirius XM website placement, detailing their attempts to improve their logo's visibility.  Further topics included The Who's Super Bowl performance, Obama bowing in China, and a caller's awkward experience in Iraq. They also commented on a publicist interfering with a Robert Pattinson interview and Ryan Seacrest's interview style.  The $10,000 fugitive saga continued as a recurring theme.

A substantial portion of the show involved vulgar and offensive humor and discussions of personal tragedies.  Opie and Anthony discussed a poorly-received movie, a fabricated celebrity relationship, and the poor performance of the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets.  A significant segment focused on listener calls and the hosts' personal anecdotes about their fathers' deaths, punctuated by crude jokes.  They detailed their emotional responses, ranging from embarrassment to acceptance, regarding their fathers' emotional displays. The conversation included further criticism of Ryan Seacrest's perceived lack of assertiveness, a listener's condemnation of those who laughed at dad-dying stories, and a call about a brother in the Peace Corps. They also discussed crying moments in movies such as *Saving Private Ryan*, *Forrest Gump*, *The Passion of the Christ*, and *The Bucket List*.  A caller recounted a father's confession of child assault, prompting discussion about offensive language and racial slurs.  They also talked about their childhood memories, including one host's father throwing popcorn in a theater during *Jaws*.  Later,  they focused on the granddaughter's attractiveness in *Saving Private Ryan*, and a caller's story of a WWII veteran father farting while crying.  A backstage segment detailed Sam Roberts' severe digestive issues after eating McDonald's.


Tony Clifton and the "Katrina Kiss My Ass Orchestra" (two female performers) then joined the show. The ensuing segment was incredibly vulgar and offensive, filled with racist, sexist, and antisemitic jokes.  Clifton boasted about his upcoming album, including a collaboration with R.E.M.  The hosts and guests engaged in a rapid-fire exchange of offensive one-liners, and there was an unsuccessful attempt to get the women to perform a burlesque dance.  Clifton recounted a physical altercation and made numerous offensive jokes. He discussed his lifestyle and living situation with the performers, calling them "Cliftonettes".  Rob Schneider briefly appeared, complaining about waiting in the parking lot.

The show concluded with a contentious interview with Rob Schneider. The interview was strained from the start due to a prior incident involving Schneider waiting in the parking lot.  The hosts attempted to steer the conversation towards Schneider's film career, but he kept returning to the parking lot issue.  The hosts and a female co-host expressed increasing frustration with Schneider's attitude, describing him as being in a "pissy fucking little mood" and believing himself to be a "big fucking star." The conversation became a heated argument, leading to the female co-host and then Schneider leaving.  Opie and Anthony then discussed the interview, praising their co-host ("Jay Bird") for standing up to Schneider and mocking Schneider's behavior. They mentioned previous difficult experiences with guests like Norm Macdonald (who they claimed smoked a lot of pot before the show) and Kevin Nealon (initially mistaken for Norm Macdonald).  The segment concluded with further jokes at Schneider's expense, referencing a *South Park* episode satirizing him and the hosts’ struggles to find material.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Sam!  Sam!  Me and Ann are here.  Yeah.  We're searching through the paper.  I mean, I've been through the paper three or four times now.  Yeah, I'm looking through...  At least three or four times.  Through all the pages. 
[00:00:30]  Every page.  Every single page.  I'm trying to find it.  I see the picture of Rihanna with her cellulite.  Yeah, I see...  I see that the Jets coach cried after the horrible loss on Sunday.  And they're making fun of him in the paper today.  Joe Biden's little fender bender going to the Daily Show.  I see that.  Yep.  Our friend Bob Saget is going to be doing some weird show on A&E.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see that.  Yeah, what else?  Alan Iverson, should the Knicks sign them? 
[00:01:00]  Of course there's a...  By the way, I say no.  Question about the terrorists being tried here in New York.  Yep.  The Attorney General catches them heat for that.  The Nets, a horrendous basketball team.  They had, like, some kind of promotion where they gave away free tickets and people still  didn't show to the game.  Oh, boy.  They haven't won a game yet.  The two New York teams, even though one's like the, you know, it's the New Jersey Nets,  but the New York City area teams.  Yeah.  Combined records?  One and 20 in the NBA this year. 
[00:01:30]  One and 20.  Wow.  The Jacko molest-wrapped dad kills himself in a luxury apartment in New Jersey.  What else we got?  Obama's in China.  Obama's in China.  Basically, Sam, what we're saying is, we just thought by now the media would have picked  up on the fugitive thing.  And I can't find one article on the fugitive.  I'm stunned that a radio station here in New York City gets robbed of $10,000. 
[00:02:00]  In cash.  In cash.  In cash.  That is a lot of money.  During broad daylight.  Yeah.  And there is what seems to be some type of criminal that is taunting them over the fact  that he stole it.  This should be front page news.  Like, look out, people.  Right, right.  Look out.  Like, the city is scared of the fugitive.  The city is what?  What would be like a Batman headline? 
[00:02:30]  Tripled by the fugitive.  Yeah.  Sure, there you go.  This is some kind of, I would call this terrorism, because he is terrorizing people through his  criminal activities.  You would think the media would be writing about this.  Oh, I don't see it at all.  Now, Sam, any opinions on why?  Well, I think that the New York newspapers obviously are flawed.  That's why I don't get my news from newspapers.  I get all my news from wrestling sites. 
[00:03:00]  Wrestling sites and 923now.fm.  And they have been covering this story.  Well, thank God.  But no one else on the internet?  Oh, no, no.  Is there any blogs about it?  No one's blogging about it?  Well, yes, there is one website that's covering it.  That would be 923now.com.  Oh, of course.  They're the only ones.  Yeah, that would be the sole website.  I'm starting to think this might be a shame.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I'm petrified.  You're still not sure?  I'm very scared.  He made that poor girl. 
[00:03:30]  What's her name?  Lisa Page.  Lisa Page made that poor girl go out on the streets with a sign.  What if the fugitive comes here and robs us for all of our Xbox games that are a year old?  Really?  Really?  He comes here, I'll kick his teeth in.  Oh, no.  No problem.  I'm so scared of it.  Are we scared of the fugitive, Anthony?  Oh, petrified.  Petrified?  Petrified.  And what do they do to this Lisa Page?  Well, they made her go downstairs from the radio station, put a sign on that said, 
[00:04:00]  I'm Lisa Page from 92.3 Now FM, and I love Barry Manilow, which, of course, she wouldn't  love Barry Manilow.  That's not now.  No.  No.  Jimmy should scream at her.  This isn't a fucking Barry Manilow concert.  Well, that's pretty outrageous that she had to do that.  Now there's a video.  Oh, no.  Why is she smacking her ass?  Because the fugitive was telling her, and this is the controversy here, she didn't  know there was a video being filmed. 
[00:04:30]  This video was posted by the fugitive.  No way.  He was there.  He was right there.  Nobody even knew.  Watching her.  Nobody knew.  And he said, hop on one leg.  Yes, he did.  And smack your butt.  Yes, he did.  So we're looking at a video of her doing all, everything the fugitive tells her to do,  and New Yorkers are walking by, and they're barely looking at her.  Yeah, they don't care less.  No one cares.  Why?  No, why?  Because, first of all, who cares if she fake likes Barry Manilow? 
[00:05:00]  And second of all, who cares?  Who cares?  And her call...  Would you say, you know, I like rancid pussy or something?  Yeah, something really outrageous.  If you're the fugitive, it would be really outrageous.  Plus, her radio station name is on the sign, so people are walking by and just going, oh,  another shitty radio promotion.  Of course.  Of course.  Exactly.  Of course.  They look at the sign and just go, oh, what is this, hack thing?  Because that's what regular radio has done to everyone.  I've never heard of that radio station. 
[00:05:30]  No, regular radio has made it exactly that, where you walk by and go, oh, another shitty  radio promotion.  Nothing outrageous, no crowds gathering around her.  Nope.  It's just people, they're milling.  People are milling and just walking to work, taking an occasional glance at her sign, so  they can go, oh, another shitty radio promotion.  Oh, just some bullshit.  Anthony?  Yes?  Somebody is on our phone. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, no.  Hello?  Hi, this is the $5 Sirius 197 Fugitive.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, we're...  $5?  I forgot to tell you guys, there's $5 missing from Steve's office.  Yes.  Oh, no.  That was my cheeseburger money.  Wait, you're the...  What's your name, sir?  Because, thank God, you made it easy for everyone, just like 92.3 now. 
[00:06:30]  I have a $1.97 $5 Fugitive.  I have a feeling we're going to have a lot of fugitives calling today.  Oh, no.  His voice is disguised.  How will we find out who he is?  I don't know.  Maybe clues.  We're calling every...  On the 17th, 617, 717, 817, 917, and 1017.  That sounds confusing.  We've got to have Travis trace the number.  Yes, yes.  Travis, trace this number.  My goodness, we have to track down. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We had him.  We only needed another 10 seconds and we'd have had him.  Oh, no.  Hey, why weren't the police there when she was outside and looking for people, maybe videotaping  her, looking oddly at her, you know.  Well, the Fugitive was taping from an alley.  Yeah, well, why did they slow down?  There's no alley.  There's no alley in that.  There's no alley.  It was broad daylight.  He was right across the street.  Open air. 
[00:07:30]  Like, she probably saw him taping her.  Look, man.  Why couldn't somebody else see him taping and then just walk up and go, hey, are you the  92 degree?  It would really suck if our Fugitive made Sam or E-Rock do some outrageous things so we  could get our $5 back.  $5.  $5.  $5.  Oh, no.  I could not get this promotion out of my head, though, last night.  I just kept thinking how horrific it was. 
[00:08:00]  And the thought of, like, placing myself into it was giving me, like, douche chills.  Oh, God, yeah.  I was getting embarrassed.  Look, I was, Ant and I were talking a little bit this morning.  I mean, we've, yeah, we've done a bit of hacky radio in our day.  Oh, hell yeah.  Sure.  But the times were a little different.  I mean, if you listen, this is a good exercise.  If you listen to the radio broadcast of us saying that the mayor of Boston died in that,  you know, horrendous car crash for April Fool's. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  You listen to that.  I mean, you're savvy enough now out there.  You will listen and go, who would believe this?  Yeah.  Who's buying that?  But people believed it because it was, what, 10, 11 years ago?  I mean, you know.  The times were different.  You could get away with it.  And it was, we were never handed something from management and told, here, do this.  If we did something hacky, it was all ours.  It was on our own terms.  Plus.  And we had to fucking deal with it. 
[00:09:00]  You guys had a history of being rebels.  Remember the time you broke into the manager's office?  Of course.  And played the Aerosmith CD early?  Oh, yeah.  Played the Aerosmith CD.  Oh, we were wild.  Yeah.  We went from, like, coming up with, you know, which you gotta say is now a hacky thing  and trying to make something out of it, to just being real.  Yeah.  Because then we realized there was just real shit to be fucking pissed off about and to  do.  Yeah, it was a lot better that way.  I can't even count how many times we walked off a radio show and had some guy in a suit 
[00:09:30]  trying to figure out what the fuck to do.  Now what?  Right.  You can't just leave your show.  Yeah, we can.  Yeah.  Bye.  So, do most of the people know what the Fugitive Bit is all about?  I would think so.  They had to be listening yesterday.  It was a buzz yesterday.  I know one radio station that was listening yesterday.  They were listening?  Apparently.  Some of our old friends over there were listening?  There's quite a buzz over at Now FM because, believe it or not, rumor has it that this entire 
[00:10:00]  station staff is not quite in unity.  A little dissension in the ranks over there?  Over the Fugitive.  Over the Fugitive Bit?  Yes.  Are we calling it a bit?  No.  We don't want to give this away now.  Why isn't it on the front page?  Is it on the front page?  Oh.  There's a banner there, yeah.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, wow.  They got a slick banner for the $10,000 Fugitive.  Help us track down the Fugitive and receive the $10,000 reward.  Now, wait a minute.  If they want the money back so much, why are they then giving it to somebody that finds 
[00:10:30]  the Fugitive?  No.  The $10,000 reward is a different $10,000.  But they want back the first $10,000.  You're robbing Peter to pay Paul, as they say.  And why do they have a slick banner?  Is this going to be on the side of buses?  Is this going to be like a marketing campaign?  They got yellow tape.  Slick yellow tape with writing in the yellow tape.  Right.  The police would tell you, like, don't do this.  Don't do this.  You're just entertaining him. 
[00:11:00]  You've created a blog dedicated to him.  Why would you do this?  It is a spinoff site.  It's really not part of 92.3 Now.  Oh, really?  Well, yeah, because it links to fugitive.923now.com.  So it's its own little entity.  Wow.  Let's just say for some reason, after we spent an hour smashing them yesterday, the web  guys at 92.3 Now decided yesterday afternoon would be a good time to post the last week's 
[00:11:30]  worth of fugitive phone calls.  Ah, so if somebody wanted to go online and listen to the clues, or perhaps record them  and play them.  Sure.  Because you might not like the promotion your radio station is doing.  We got friends and spies at almost every radio station in New York City, especially.  Oh, hysterical.  Maybe we're all the fugitives.  Oh, that is funny.  So this guy.  Oh, it's Jay from Huntington.  He's a regular.  Sign should have read Lisa Page, 92.3 Now. 
[00:12:00]  So, come dumpster, put it in my shitter.  Yeah, get a little wild.  Oh, God.  She would have had to do it.  The fugitive has her hostage.  Well, the fugitive has everyone hostage.  He stole $10,000 from the marketing room of 923now.fm.  That was allotted for the Yankee Parade.  It was the last $10,000 of the budget, so they need it back.  So they can give it away.  So they can give it away to whoever finds the fugitive. 
[00:12:30]  By the way, no one spends money on the Yankee Parade.  No, a radio station.  We've been here for a bunch of the World Series now, wins.  And no one spends any money.  You just show up.  You show up with the van.  And you give out some stickers.  You give out stickers.  And you throw some confetti or whatever the fuck that shit is.  Yeah, you throw your little ticker tape confetti.  Right.  You maybe give out some of those big cards saying what the station's about.  You don't spend $10,000.  Maybe they wanted to buy $10,000 worth of bumper stickers. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, but...  No.  You don't think so?  But they can't even do that right.  No.  The money was for the Yankee Parade.  The $10,000 was going to be used for the Yankee Parade.  So we got a few fugitive clips here for everybody.  Yeah, I wanted to catch everybody up.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I got from the last couple days.  And then I spent all day yesterday listening to fugitive, waiting to hear from the fugitive.  Because he says he'll call at 3 p.m.  Mm-hmm.  Sometimes it's 3.20. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Sometimes it's 3.50.  I wonder why.  I don't know.  I wonder if our fugitive is going to call back soon.  I'm scared.  Well, he said on the 17s.  Yes.  Every day on the 17s.  On the 17s.  So it's 7.17.  Hopefully we'll get a fugitive.  Oh, boy.  I hope so.  But what if there's another fugitive that has to call it on the 22?  Maybe.  It could be another fugitive.  We're just going to be taking fugitive calls.  There's other things missing.  Of course. 
[00:14:00]  Like E-Rock's sense of humor.  Yeah.  Steve's diet plan.  Dignity.  Steve's dignity.  Yeah.  Don't forget about his work ethic.  His work ethic.  Long gone.  Yeah.  The lower half of his shirt.  Oh, my goodness.  There are all these fugitives.  Oh, the fugitive has to return that.  Please.  We beg you.  Steve's getting really fucking fat, man.  Oh, God damn.  What the fuck is that about? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, damn, yo.  Oh, my goodness.  What is that about?  Wow.  It's kind of creepy.  I mean.  He ran through it here.  He said it's an addiction.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  He kind of slipped off of the wagon for a little while.  And, you know.  He'll probably get himself back in shape soon.  I'm sure.  He's under a lot of pressure with, you know, family man and stuff like that.  He's going to be a father.  Not work stuff.  It's just.  Oh, work stuff?  No, no.  No, no.  No, no, no, no.  Don't be silly.  All right.  So. 
[00:15:00]  The fugitive.  Let's take a map.  Hey, Friday.  So we're going back to last Friday.  Yeah.  Catch everybody up because we played the beginning of the fugitive stuff.  Yeah.  Yesterday at the end of the show.  So I wanted to go back and.  Oh, catch people up.  Make sure that everybody knows the fugitive is still out there.  Okay.  And what the fugitive is about because some people probably still don't know.  Yeah.  They're probably paralyzed in fear.  So they don't remember.  Not one article, though, Sam.  We looked in all the papers.  You know how lame this thing is? 
[00:15:30]  Even David Hinckley, who writes the lamest radio column.  The radio column.  In our business.  Isn't even picking up on it.  He didn't mention it today.  I'd rather talk about the classical fucking radio station in town.  Oh.  Classical music.  I would have thought he would at least mention it.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Our intern just brought in 92.3 now at the Yankee Parade.  If you guys want to pass this around.  Let me see.  That's the representation.  Okay.  There's three girls. 
[00:16:00]  Two of them with stickers.  Two of them have stickers on their chest.  Well, they couldn't do anything because they didn't have the $10,000.  That's true.  You're proving their point.  That's true.  They probably had a huge thing planned.  Yeah.  Until this fugitive came along.  Who's the cute girl in the middle?  Oh.  Maybe she's the fugitive.  Oh.  We all know Chunky's the fugitive.  I got to blow up their spot.  Chunky is fugitive.  Because he's the only one not participating as far as all the major day parts.  Oh. 
[00:16:30]  Jesus.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist.  So Friday, the fugitive calls Lisa Page.  Yes.  You think they're sitting over there going, Opie and Anthony are all over this.  We're getting great.  Yeah.  Promotion.  Fantastic.  I told you we'd pick up a buzz on this.  Really?  See, this is an instance of all press isn't good press.  You know?  You know?  They say that.  Every time an intern comes in here with bad audio, I have to explain the difference between  attention and negative attention.  Yeah.  And getting negative attention is not the same thing. 
[00:17:00]  Not good.  And I could speak for probably all the listeners.  There's not one of them that would actually walk around New York tapping people on the shoulder  going, are you the fugitive?  Yeah, this is really not going to happen.  10 G's on the line.  Trust me.  Especially with that audience and that demo.  They're not the type that they're going to be tapping people on the shoulder.  Hello?  Are you the...  No.  Because...  92.3.  Now FM.  10,000 dollar fugitive? 
[00:17:30]  You said it correctly.  Because this is how the promotion works.  Just in case you're thinking of walking around New York and starting to tap, you know, strangers  on the back.  Yeah.  The fugitive is nowhere to be seen until he needs to be seen, which will be at the end  of the promotion.  Of course.  Which will probably be at least another two to three, maybe a month.  We can only hope.  Maybe a month.  You know what?  And then all of a sudden, wow, he's out there.  We know he's out there.  Oh my God, he's in Times Square and he has a yellow shirt on. 
[00:18:00]  Because I guarantee the lawyers made it so specific.  Yeah.  So no one does get hurt.  No one gets hurt.  You know what got me disillusioned with radio contests?  It was years and years ago, before I ever even had the wildest hallucination of getting  into radio.  Right.  I used to listen to WBAB up there on Long Island.  It wasn't one of mine, was it?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, I believe it was, was it Jerry Martir or something?  But it was a whole thing of, if we play the same song twice in a day, you win $10,000. 
[00:18:30]  I was part of that.  And everyone was listening like, oh my God, if they played that song.  And then I was like, wow, okay, I'm listening and I think they play that.  No, they didn't.  And people calling up going, you play that.  He goes, no, it's a trick.  I played this version of another song.  And it ended with, I think, Jerry Martir or something saying, and at such and such an  hour, I think I'm going to slip up and play. 
[00:19:00]  And I was like, it was, the balloon, all the air came out and just went around the room  for me, around the radio room for me.  And I was like, why is he telling?  You never know.  Oh no.  And I was like, oh no.  You never know when it's going to happen.  But I would listen around 7.20 this morning.  And it's exactly what it was.  Oh no, it's the 106.1 BLI $10,000 fugitive page. 
[00:19:30]  Are you funny?  Well, this is the official contest rules page for the fugitive.  Why is it a different station?  Oh no.  You can't have official rules.  You fucking idiot.  Official rules.  But it's a criminal.  The fugitive 106.1 BLI reality radio.  This is real.  Reality.  Reality radio.  It's actuality.  Are they doing the fugitive at the same time as New York? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, isn't BLI like Long Island?  That's Long Island, obviously, yeah.  But if so, then the fugitive, he must be all over the place.  BLI.  How do they know this?  Immediately.  Well, it says the true fugitive will provide identification and give you a letter  on BLI-headed paper duly signed by members of senior staff.  Well, wait a minute.  Why would he have that?  Yeah, why would the fugitive do that?  Maybe he got pictures of them.  I guess he stole some letterhead, too. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  No, I think he got pictures of the staff of the management in compromising sexual positions  and made them sign the paper.  This contest was from 2006, so I figured out what we're dealing with in 92.3 now.  So this was done three years ago, and there was never a buzz on this.  No, but now we're dealing with a copycat burglar.  Ugh.  All right, let's go.  The contest cannot be won outside of the designated operation hours, Monday through Sunday, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
[00:21:00]  Of course, overnight you're not going to find a fugitive.  In order to be a contestant, must the location or identity of the BLI fugitive then approach this individual  and say verbatim, are you the BLI $10,000 fugitive?  If it is the fugitive, the contestant will be given the key, which is a winner's letter on station letterhead, blah, blah, blah.  By the way, what you're listening to is Anthony reading lawyer shit. 
[00:21:30]  This is lawyer shit.  Lawyers will fuck up every great idea on the radio.  This is lawyer shit.  The question has to be asked directly in person and in close physical proximity to the person the listener believes to be the fugitive.  If the person is the fugitive and has been questioned with an acceptable question listed above during a bounty period,  they will answer yes, and the contestant will be subject to complying with these terms and conditions in full with the bounty. 
[00:22:00]  It is total lawyer time.  When you suggest if you're looking for the fugitive, you should be armed, call the police.  I would be armed if I was searching for the fugitive, whatever that means to you.  Whoever finds the fugitive should immediately place him under citizen's arrest.  Neat to his fucking back.  Yes.  Definitely.  Wow, this is amazing.  Matt in Boston.  Matt.  I've got to tell you, man, this fugitive guy really gets around. 
[00:22:30]  Last summer, he was up in Boston with WROR.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Wow, really?  Wow.  Oh, wait, wait.  How could he not have been caught?  Danny, I'm sorry.  It says here, no person who approaches and or questions the fugitive will be answered truthfully  or will win a prize if any of the following apply.  They have done so outside of the bounty period, outside of the designated hours of operation.  The fugitive is traveling in private transport. 
[00:23:00]  Of course.  The fugitive is in a private residence or place of accommodation.  The fugitive, uh, the person is ineligible to enter or, uh, there is one person who has  been appointed as the fugitive.  It's all, like you said, lawyer speak.  It's all lawyer crap.  So that means if he's in a restaurant, you can't ask him.  You can say he'll just lie.  No, he just has to be on the streets or something.  Yes, he has to be in a public.  That's so dumb.  No liabilities for injuries, losses, damages of any kind suffered by participants. 
[00:23:30]  This is how desperate regular radio is.  They get one idea that they think is good, and then they just spread it around the radio  community.  No one's thinking for themselves anymore.  No one.  In New York City, they should be thinking for themselves.  This is the big, uh, the big market in radio.  This isn't Des Moines, Iowa.  Not to make fun of you, uh, Des Moines, Iowans out there.  The number one market.  Take contests for markets lower than number one that didn't work in those markets.  Yeah, this is the first I'm hearing of this, uh, promotion. 
[00:24:00]  I try to stay up on this shit, and you're telling me it happened three years ago.  No clue.  All right, let's get into the audio, Anthony.  Their fugitive is out there, though.  All right, so I'm kidding aside.  It's our old station, 92.3 now.  It's a fugitive, stole $10,000, and now you get to hear a lot of bad acting and just horrible  fucking promotions.  By the way, Kevin from Connecticut says, Google $10,000 fugitive.  There are like 35 results of the same bit.  Oh, my gosh.  Hot 98.1. 
[00:24:30]  What?  The fugitive struck there as well.  Oh, my God.  Not hot 98.1.  How does this hacky fucking contest get into so many stations?  The PDs should be strung up.  Strung up for fucking going along with this.  Oh, my gosh.  Not original 106 FM.  The fugitive struck there as well.  Wow.  And there it is, terms and conditions, and it's pages of legalese at the end of this.  Terms and conditions. 
[00:25:00]  I'm embarrassed to be part of this fucking business.  If you don't ask, you can't win, it says.  That's ridiculous.  That was just March of this year.  And who is this?  Oh, no.  No.  It's like C-102 has the fugitive Manchester.  It's the same logo and everything.  Manchester's number one for dance and R&B.  And the fugitive.  He struck worldwide.  He's in the UK as well.  No way.  Look at that.  Manchester.  That's incredible.  How could he travel country to country without getting stopped by customs or something? 
[00:25:30]  We've got to completely take down regular radio.  We've got to fucking just destroy it.  The fugitive has a lot of money.  I thought 10 grand.  All right.  That's a lot of money.  But you know something?  You can't live off of it.  This guy's up to like hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Did he struck Saskatoon as well?  Yes, he did.  Oh, no.  C-95.  At Saskatoon's number one hit music station.  Saskatoon.  Not Saskatoon.  And then now the phones are lit.  He struck in Austin last summer. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, wow.  Cash in Texas.  Cash.  Yeah.  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  The same fugitive was in Texas last.  I don't know if it was last fall or last summer.  But the only thing they did different was they didn't put the poor bitch out on the street with a sign.  But same stupid game.  This fugitive.  I love how 97.5 Eagle Country couldn't afford to go all in with the promotion. 
[00:26:30]  They have the $5,000 fugitive.  Yes, he's on a discount.  Maybe there wasn't as much cash in the promotions office to steal.  No, not at the country station.  No.  And one of their big sponsors is Mohawk Bingo Palace.  Yeah.  They took our $5,000.  What are we going to do?  Oh, no.  This is a real problem.  This guy is a serial robber.  He certainly is.  He's got to be taken off the streets.  He's just a burglar out there, burglarizing radio stations across the world. 
[00:27:00]  I wouldn't tap him on the shoulder.  If you know who the fugitive is, I would definitely alert the authorities.  Yes.  And point at him and go, that man stole $10,000 and he should be taken into custody, sir.  Immediately.  Or I would suggest to punch him in the face because, you know, he is a fugitive and he needs to be stopped immediately.  YouTube video section.  MediasinAZ.com is in Phoenix, Arizona and is placing and updating a variety of interesting clips on the side to share it with the world. 
[00:27:30]  One of the most competitive fields in the media business is radio.  And the question, how can we capture our audience and add more listeners?  With free giveaways, of course.  And money.  Lots of money.  All right.  Hold on.  Pause this.  Yeah.  Pause it.  Wait.  What is this?  Right as you went to the audio, I started watching it.  So I'm trying to figure it out.  Are they this stupid to have a YouTube clip explaining the whole fugitive fucking promotion?  Promotion.  I think so.  With some suit.  There's some fucking stupid suit sitting there. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Explaining marketing and shit.  And I feel like I'm in one of these dull meetings I used to fall asleep in.  Well, you're not going to get listeners with programming.  You need money.  No.  Money.  I'm plenty of it.  Money in contests.  That's what does it.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Let's hear this.  96.9 in Phoenix obviously has found a way.  Besides a nice chunk of the mixed green stuff, the radio station added a new twist to it called  the Mix 96.9 $10,000 Fugitive. 
[00:28:30]  All of you have no clue what I'm talking about.  Here's the story in a nutshell.  It all started on Monday morning, October 9th, 2006, when Chris Parker, who is a morning  DJ, was set to give away $10,000 to one of the listeners.  One of the employees from a promotions department had to go to the bank and deliver the money  back to the station.  He stopped at a coffee shop to get a booster, and when he came out of the building, the van 
[00:29:00]  was gone.  With the $10,000.  Different amount.  Different amount.  The van was discovered a short time later, but the money was gone.  And now inside the van was found, and it said, I have the money.  I'll be calling you soon.  Now, the self-proclaimed Mix 96.9 $10,000 Fugitive has been calling Mix 96.9 at various times  of the day with clues as to his or her identity and what abouts.  According to the rules, the first person to approach the Fugitive asking him, I use a mix 
[00:29:30]  96.9 $10,000 Fugitive will be able to keep the money.  But to make this even more twisted, the Fugitive demanded the morning DJ Chris Parker to dress  in drag and stand on a corner of 44th Street and Van Geuren, which is one of the hot spots  in Phoenix, just to get another clue from the 96.9 $10,000 Fugitive. 
[00:30:00]  They can't even think of themselves.  We were there, and here's what we saw.  We were there, and here's what we saw.  Mix 96.9, the best mix of the 80s.  I ain't got to sign.  It's the exact same fucking video.  You have been hunting for the Mix 96.9 $10,000 Fugitive.  Do your favor.  Give me a little hon.  Oh, I'm embarrassed.  We've got to get out of radio, eh?  We've got to move on to this.  Give me a little hon.  There's no honking.  There's nobody honking the horn.  One person honked.  Didn't the guy in the video say this was one of the hot spots in Phoenix?  Yes.  He's on a corner. 
[00:30:30]  There's nobody there.  Cars are driving by.  Chris, you look so ugly out there.  I've seen men dress better than this.  That's got a deep voice.  He's just walking up to cars.  No one knows who he is. 
[00:31:00]  It scared him.  I have you a special little rock right now.  Both you and players have something in common other than your singing abilities.  And then a face to find a $10,000 Fugitive.  Oh, jeez.  Holy shit.  It's so funny to just hear some stupid suit with a horrible I don't know where he's from accent describing this horrid promotion.  But he thinks he's, like, helping the promotion along. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Helping.  I can't believe he's stolen a van, too.  Well, he left the van, though.  Yeah.  I wonder if they dusted it for Prince and did, like, some forensics on it, trying to find some hair fibers.  This fugitive is very tricky.  He must have worn gloves.  Well, we got 92.3 now doing the fugitive thing.  We got Lisa Page.  This is from Friday.  Yes, from Friday morning.  All right. 
[00:32:00]  So here's what we know about the person who stole the $10,000.  That they have no soul.  I don't like you very much.  Oh, don't worry.  The feeling's very mutual.  What has happened to this business?  Frustrated that he won't give the money back?  It's dead.  This business is dead.  It's always been hacked.  I understand that.  But now it's just horrendous.  How would a station...  Why would she give a shit? 
[00:32:30]  I don't understand how a station could Google this if they're approached with it and go, like, all right, there's this $10,000 fugitive bit we want to do.  And then it's like, okay, let me Google this and see how many stations have done it.  Watch video and go, yeah, that's what we need.  See you later, Z100.  Oh, whoa.  What happened, Danny?  Danny what?  What do you got?  I found a YouTube video of video surveillance of the heist of the $10,000 from Mix 94.7. 
[00:33:00]  Where is Mix 94.7?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  How long is this?  This is security footage, I guess.  So that's what you know.  You see a car pulling into a parking spot.  Car pulls in.  Right.  I guess this is the money being delivered, maybe, to the station?  I guess so.  I don't know.  What's going to happen?  But somebody's getting out of the vehicle.  Yep.  All right.  They closed the door.  They're walking in. 
[00:33:30]  Now they're out of camera view.  Think out for this surveillance camera.  Oh, maybe the money's still in the car.  Wait, who's that?  Who's that?  That's a different guy.  Somebody's walking up to the car, reaching in the window, and pulling out a suitcase.  Oh, no.  And just walking slowly away.  That's the station's money.  Oh, wow.  The fucking idiot goes like this, like he's setting his alarm.  Press conference.  But the window's open.  What's the press conference?  Oh, my God.  No.  There's a press conference. 
[00:34:00]  No, there isn't a press conference.  It makes me...  Oh, there's the press.  Hold on, this is Nick's 94.7 spokesperson.  This is great.  There are...  Oh, by the way, don't get confused.  We're changing call letters left and right, because everyone is doing the same stupid promotion.  Everyone's doing this.  And this guy now, there's one of the suits.  He's just walked in to give the press conference, I guess, on the missing money.  The press is there.  Yes.  But the press seems to be interns and station workers, maybe a total of eight of them. 
[00:34:30]  I think it's the press.  Uh, no.  I don't think so.  I don't see one local news station at the press conference.  No, there's no news there.  It's just fake people.  It's like the big, giant press people at wrestling press conferences talking about Vince.  They had to get all their microphones from the production studios just to make it look  good.  Yeah.  No one's getting their work done.  They all have notepads.  Yeah, great.  Oh, do they?  Yes.  Let's hear the press conference.  All right, here we go.  Press conference. 
[00:35:00]  I'd like to thank you all for coming.  I want to thank you very much.  I worked here.  Here's the story so far.  This morning, during the JB and Sandy morning show, Digis went to collect the $10,000 for  our contest to place into the Vince 94.7 $10,000 cash vault.  He made a stop along the way back to the station, and the money was taken from his car.  I'll take some questions. 
[00:35:30]  Is the truth that Digis is going to be fired?  I cannot talk about that at this moment.  Oh, no.  Is there a surveillance video of the theft?  Yes, there is, and we will be making that available as soon as possible.  Do you know what I'm doing?  I have a question.  What's going to happen to the cash vault contest?  It looks like it's going to have to be suspended at this time.  Do we know who did it?  Are there any suspects?  Yes, there is, but I cannot disclose that at this time. 
[00:36:00]  I want to thank you all very much.  Oh, that's it?  Oh, they're done with the cash, James.  Why couldn't they have the interns dressed as reporters better?  I am fucking embarrassed.  Why is there a TV camera there?  No one with a microphone.  It's old school reporters with a notepad.  There wasn't one.  They can't even fucking do it right.  There wasn't one microphone or place to plug in a microphone.  If you're going to commit, commit. 
[00:36:30]  This is a big coincidence that they have a surveillance tape, because on 92.3 Now FM's web page,  they also have a surveillance tape.  Oh, thank God.  On the $10,000 Fugitive blog.  They fucking do.  They have a surveillance tape.  Now, that would be of the office, because the MOs are all different.  Sometimes it's stealing a van.  Sometimes it's reaching into a car that's parked at the station.  Sometimes it's at a coffee place.  Here's security footage.  Security footage from what? 
[00:37:00]  92.3 Now?  Yes.  Offices of XRK.  See?  There it is.  Okay.  Who's that guy?  Somebody's just skulking in with a hoodie on, and they got it.  Well, I guess it's not chunky, because this guy's thin.  Could be Buster, the guy who...  Well, Buster did originally pirate his radio show, and then they gave him one.  I don't know who he is.  He's the night guy.  Oh, he's the guy's...  Oh, right.  He did a pirate radio show, and they gave him the night shift. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  All the security cameras.  I like how the security cameras are kind of moving, shaking like a handheld fucking...  They can't even do something.  You can't even get a tripod.  They can't even fucking...  Get a tripod.  Someone's holding the camera.  If it's a security camera, it wouldn't move, you fucking dopes.  Like, it's moving.  Fucking idiots.  I think you even saw it in the reflection in the window.  Right.  Oh, now he's in an office, stealing the money.  He's in the office.  Oh, no.  What?  I mean, it's obvious there's a 923 Now sign right there, so that's the promotion's office. 
[00:38:00]  It's so obvious.  Yeah, front and side.  Hey, that's the money!  So it's a...  Well, he's coming back.  He also took something else.  Oh, my God.  Oh, probably the letterhead.  Of course, the letterhead.  And there's the person standing with the camera in the reflection in the window.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I have the security footage.  It's actually a guy with a camera.  You can see his reflection.  It's moving.  It's moving around.  It's just moving around. 
[00:38:30]  It's a guy on a stool.  They can't even come in and do it right.  They can't do it right.  All right, let's get to Lisa Page.  So this is Friday.  The future of calling her show.  All right, so here's what we know about the person who stole the $10,000.  That they have no soul.  I don't like you very much.  Oh, don't worry.  The feeling's very mutual.  And now everything that Tic Tac has been telling me about you.  What the hell has he been saying about me?  Oh, he doesn't like you very much either, but that's another story. 
[00:39:00]  Well, I'll deal with him at 3 o'clock.  Here's the deal.  You don't seem to have learned anything yet.  So we're going to have a little lesson in humility at 1 o'clock.  Oh, okay.  You're going to teach me a lesson over the phone?  I'm scared.  Oh, honey, so young, so dumb.  Don't call me honey, you a**hole.  Whoa, whoa.  We all start with one and this.  Out sharing in school, my first friend, their name was Aaron. 
[00:39:30]  Ask anyone you know whose name is Aaron.  I'll talk to you at 1 o'clock.  So your first friend's name was Aaron?  Hello?  Hello?  The boat.  Oh, boy.  Thank God that on live radio, they had time to throw that beep in over her curse.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank God somebody hit the beep.  That guy's quick.  Yeah.  You didn't even get the first letter out of that cuss word.  Oh, my God.  The first thing they need to do is make the fugitive so he can understand what he's saying. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  He said his first friend's name was Aaron.  Oh, whatever.  Yeah.  And then Tic Tac sees Lisa Page with the Barry Manilow sign.  But he doesn't know what's going on.  Then hears from the fugitive.  Because he sees he comes to work for his shift.  And Lisa Page is outside with this I heart Barry Manilow sign.  He's going, what the heck is going on?  How would he not know that the fugitive is doing this?  Maybe he wasn't listening to the radio.  I don't know.  How'd she talk?  Why are we trying to make rhyme? 
[00:40:30]  New York's new hit music channel, 92.3 now.  I am Tic Tac.  This is the freak show.  So what happened to Lisa?  I was walking in and she had a big sign saying, I am Lisa Page and I love Barry Manilow.  So why was she freaking out?  Something's going on with this thing.  All right.  Hold on.  So why is she freaking out?  Well, obviously she doesn't want to be sitting outside with a fucking Barry Manilow sign on.  You dope.  Oh, God.  Who told her to do that?  And how did she feel? 
[00:41:00]  No, no.  I mean, really.  Oh.  Management.  Management was like, all right, now you got to do the thing.  See, all the other stations have done this.  You got to go out with a sign in some kind of ridiculous situation.  C100 may have Elvis Duran and Ryan Seacrest, but 92.3 now has the fugitive and commercial free Mondays.  And Tic Tac.  And Tic Tac and the freak show.  So nothing freaky is happening.  No.  Because you can't do anything on regular radio anymore.  I hate this.  I hate this. 
[00:41:30]  Don't forget about their pirate radio show at night.  Yes, Buster.  Who started his night show by hacking in and doing a pirate radio show.  And then they decided to make him there full time.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  We have another press conference.  We got a BLI press conference.  This one includes, it says Breaking News Live on the bottom of the screen.  Must be from a news broadcast.  No, it's not.  What do you think, it's just a template in a movie editor?  And there seems to be a security guy, a uniformed security guy next to the gentleman that we'll be giving the press conference. 
[00:42:00]  Look how lame.  They found one poster.  With a giant fucking banner that's hung crooked on the wall behind him.  Because they didn't have time to set it up right.  And again, the fake press.  The GM was too busy yelling at his salespeople and telling them to sell more.  Get their numbers up.  Oh, we're all going to be fired.  Go ahead.  Let's see.  Good morning, press.  Good morning.  As you know, this morning at 7 a.m.  6.1 BLI, $10,000 was stolen from the BLI van. 
[00:42:30]  Big Randy has lost the money.  And someone who calls themselves the fugitive has the money.  I'm here to answer a few questions.  I can't answer and get into too many details, but I'll take a few questions for the press right now.  That's why the police are there.  Yes.  Do you know who's called the money?  We do not know who it is.  The person's called the fugitive.  And they're going to give out more clues.  I think they're playing a game with us.  More questions.  Yes, in the front.  That's right.  Where does that happen? 
[00:43:00]  It happened on Deer Park Ave.  I can't tell you exactly where Big Randy went to get a cup of coffee.  The wine dance?  The fugitive came into the BLI van and took the money.  Why can't you say exactly where you came from?  Yes.  What does the fugitive look like?  The fugitive, we don't know if it's a male or a female.  Tall, short.  We're looking for a surveillance camera video.  Of course.  We'll find that.  See if we can get more information.  This is a different station.  Yes.  Man in the suit in the back.  Was Big Randy injured?  Big Randy is fine.  Another question, please. 
[00:43:30]  Thank God.  Thank God.  Who the fuck's Big Randy?  The idea where the fugitive is hiding.  We don't know, but we're going to hunt him down.  We're going to find him.  We're going to find the BLI $10,000 fugitive.  And that money deserves to be somewhere in Long Island for a BLI listener.  No perfect questions.  Why?  Why does it deserve to be?  This is not the fugitive station.  It's the people station.  Wow.  That's a $20,000 fugitive.  Oh, the fugitive was daring that day.  Wow.  That radio station is doing a little better. 
[00:44:00]  Well, yeah.  I mean, this press conference has definitely went viral considering it 372 YouTube views.  Wow.  Wow.  372.  Now, what am I really hoping all their listeners would flood to the fucking YouTube video?  Oh, yeah.  What am I looking at here that says BLI $20,000 fugitive captured?  Oh.  Oh, no.  That's three minutes of joy.  No, I can't deal with three minutes.  Come on.  I want to hear if it's...  I can't do three minutes.  This was June 7, 2007. 
[00:44:30]  So two years ago.  No clue.  What's your name?  Michelle.  Michelle, you just won $20,000.  Why does a fugitive have a mic?  Have you guys been hunting around?  Yes.  Yeah.  Where did you go tonight?  I was thinking...  We're at a Cold Spring Harbor.  I never won.  And I heard the last clip.  It's North Point.  It's North Point.  It's North Point.  Is it?  You can pause this.  That's all we need to say.  The fugitive now has a radio station microphone. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, he's got a mic.  And he's really anticlimactic.  Oh, my.  Yeah, you just won.  What did you say?  Yes, I'm the fugitive.  Here.  Here's an envelope.  Bye.  I work for the station.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I am the fugitive.  Police!  Police!  Lamest contest ever?  At least when...  What do you think?  As far as high-profile contests go, it's right up there, man.  At least it's right up there.  Unbelievable.  At least when wrestling does fake press conferences, you get to see a car blow up or something. 
[00:45:30]  Exactly.  You know, or a midget get killed or something.  Big fucking bicep guys holding cameras.  Well, let's get the latest audio from 92.3 Now and their fugitive.  Yeah.  Here's the tip.  It's a different fugitive.  Of course.  Ew!  New York's new hit music channel, 92.3 Now.  I am Tic Tac.  This is the freak show.  So what happened to Lisa?  I was walking in and she had a big sign saying, I am Lisa Page and I love Barry Manilow.  So why was she freaking out?  Something's going on with this fugitive guy. 
[00:46:00]  All right, hold on.  Is the fugitive on the phone?  Yep.  Hello.  Mr. Tic Tac.  Hey, fugitive.  I want to know what you did to Lisa.  She left here freaking out.  Well, Lisa needed a little lesson.  And you, I'm kind of on the fence about you.  You tried a little trickery last night.  Here's the deal.  If you try anything stupid like that again, I'll have you dancing in the middle of Grand  Central Station in a lead-up hard like Lady Gaga if you screw around with me again. 
[00:46:30]  But I sent you the little guest.  Do you see what I put on YouTube?  I was watching Lisa.  She's fun to watch.  Wait a minute.  You were watching Lisa do her sign with Barry Manilow.  The entire time.  Oh, it says Lisa Page loves Barry Manilow.  You posted it?  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Wow, he was very surprised that.  Yeah.  See, he didn't really know there was a video, but obviously he did know there was a video. 
[00:47:00]  Are the police working in conjunction with YouTube to see who uploaded the video?  I would think so, but the username is 923nowfugitive, so it could be anyone.  I wonder who it's traced back to.  We got friends at YouTube.  We should have it removed.  Have their account suspended so that fucking 20 people can't view the video.  Do you think there's a problem if the email that it's registered to ends in at 923now.com?  Yeah, that's a little questionable. 
[00:47:30]  Holy shit, so I guess now he's going to be in Times Square soon and no one's going to give a shit?  Well, no, the fugitive threatened to put him in Grand Central in a leotard dancing like Lady Gaga.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  Because we will be there.  Of course we will.  That has not been confirmed.  It's just a threat.  Let me know when that happens.  We will be there.  Oh, we have to be there.  Okay?  Okay.  I'm going to get a bunch of our listeners to just openly laugh and mock the guy.  Look at you.  What do you think?  And scream how horrendous they're fucking...  Are you the fugitive? 
[00:48:00]  We should do a prelude to the homeless shopping spree and just bring dozens of homeless people in to touch him while he dances.  Ew, ew.  All right, here's...  Get the stench on him.  Let's roll through these clips now that we have really figured out how lame this thing is.  Tic Tac gets the clue and tries to investigate.  Yeah.  But isn't he doing his radio show?  But it is more important.  Remember, I'll always be watching, but I have to go.  So I'm going to say something.  I'm going to say something quick.  I said I've had money, and of fact, I am good. 
[00:48:30]  One of my first painting jobs involved delivering wood.  I'm going to go.  I'll talk to you in three hours.  Hold on.  Let me...  You got the replay on that?  Replay that.  Go ahead.  But one of my first painting...  All right, look.  You've heard us many times when boss says something stupid and we try to get the replay.  And it does take a couple of minutes to get it, to be able to replay it. 
[00:49:00]  Anthony, are you going to sit there and try to tell me that this phone call to a live radio station could have been recorded?  Yeah, I'm saying that.  But the callers are also quick and to the point.  Wow.  I'm having a problem with the horrendous acting.  I can't get past the...  Wait, so you're saying...  Wait, you got that?  Replay that.  One of my first painting jobs involved delivering wood. 
[00:49:30]  Go back a little bit.  Go back.  Now play.  I said I've had money, and of fact...  What does it say here?  And of fact, I am good.  Is it in a vest, I'm good?  One of my first painting jobs involved delivering wood.  Okay, hey, do me a favor.  Get the promotions team that was out filming Lisa, or right by Lisa.  Do me a favor.  Since you posted this one...  Whoopsie-daisy. 
[00:50:00]  Whoopsie.  Why would you be filming Lisa, you fucking asshole?  He blew it right there.  Get the promotions team that was filming her.  I mean, the fugitive was filming her.  The fugitive was filming her.  I gotta hear that again.  He fucked up.  Oops.  Ah, that's so good.  Listen.  The team that was out filming Lisa, or right by Lisa.  Do me a favor.  Since he posted this on YouTube, get the promotions team that had the cameras.  Get them in here. 
[00:50:30]  The promotion team was taking still pictures.  That was just a slip of the tongue, I'm sure.  Get the promotion team that was filming...  I mean, I'm not...  Dyer, Dyer, Dyer.  Dyer.  So we got Monday's phone call.  As in two days ago.  Yes.  Two days ago.  We're really...  I mean, I'm telling you, this thing is still going.  It's been going for 10 days, two weeks, something like that.  All right, Brittany, Commercial Free Monday is on New York's new hit music channel, 92.3. 
[00:51:00]  Now, I am Tic Tac.  I am trying to find this guy that stole the $10,000, the $10,000 fugitive, and apparently  he's on the line.  I need somebody with Google.  Get ready, because...  Oh.  Who has Google?  This clue, I have a weird feeling...  I got it right.  ...is going to get a little bit of it away.  How would you call that?  How would he know?  He's starting to get a feeling.  How would he know they need Google...  And he has a feel...  And he's got his clothing.  Oh, my God.  I can't.  I fucking hate this promotion. 
[00:51:30]  I hate everyone involved with it.  His instincts are freakishly good.  That's why it's called The Freak Show.  That's his freaky quality.  He's got great instincts.  He's got ESP.  He's a mutant.  Yes.  I can't tell you how many times Bob, our agent, calls and goes,  fucking corporate is out of their minds with you, because you just won't listen to them.  They don't understand why you won't listen to them.  They know.  This is why.  This is every suit's good idea. 
[00:52:00]  Right.  Right here.  This is, like, a great idea.  Hey, we're talking about them.  Obviously, they're making waves.  Really?  I think he's going to give a little bit of it away.  Tick-tack.  I went to school.  In fact, I'm on my way right now.  If your school colors included orange, maybe we sat next to each other.  Into study hall.  Nothing rhymes with orange, by the way.  That's it?  How many school colors have orange? 
[00:52:30]  Stop being such a douche.  I'll call tomorrow.  All right.  No, hold on a second.  Does that mean he's heading to school?  What kind of school?  It's got to be a college, but hold on.  Tick-tack.  I went to school.  In fact, I'm on my way right now.  If your school colors included orange, maybe we sat next to each other into study hall.  All right.  What school has orange colors?  Somebody call me up right now or text me. 
[00:53:00]  Wait a minute.  Syracuse University has the color orange.  Does it?  I don't have to fucking smoke up there.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's a cheap color.  Oh.  Oh, my gosh.  I'm angry.  I'm running out of steam.  I'm angry.  I'm trying to get to the end of this segment.  I know.  I'm so mad.  I'm mad at radio.  You guys should try to find the fugitive.  I'm mad at an entire industry.  When they said, look, you know, we're not going to continue with you guys. 
[00:53:30]  I was thinking, all right, they're coming in with something fucking big and strong.  And it's going to.  New.  Well, they don't have a morning show.  Yeah, I understand.  We were.  They didn't want to continue with us.  And they never got another morning show.  No.  Yeah.  But they got middays.  They got middays.  And they got the fugitives.  They got the fugitive.  And they got chunky.  And this person wonders why I fucking hate him.  Yesterday, the fugitive called Lisa Page.  All right. 
[00:54:00]  I'm telling you.  We're going to find this $10,000.  The fugitive is still on the loose and on the line.  Hello, Lisa.  Right on time.  I think that you learned your lesson.  Yes.  I will never be the same person again before Friday.  Well, don't speak too soon.  There's still, you know, until somebody catches me, I'm just messing with your head.  Okay.  So what's the latest hint?  Because people are already calling.  And, you know, I got to tell you, a lot of people are out there putting it together.  I think that we're closer than you think. 
[00:54:30]  You know, I've kept track of what I've said.  And I think that I've given you lots of good information.  Would you like something even better than good?  Yeah.  Hook it up.  Give me a juicy hint.  Oh, how you beg and ask for answers to this mystery.  What's driving me insane?  I really, really know.  I'm curious.  Well, when they find me, will it be because they saw me on TV?  I got to go.  What?  On TV?  Hello?  TV, huh?  Hmm. 
[00:55:00]  What?  TV?  Just play the fucking music.  Play the city of Lena Gaga.  Shut up and play the music.  Shut up and play the music.  I can't take it.  He's been on TV.  He's been on TV.  This fugitive.  Yeah.  I think it's a naked cowboy involved with this.  Oh.  He went to school.  Do you know who it is?  I mean, the naked cowboy sounds like a good guess, actually.  That's actually not a bad guess.  I bet it is a naked cowboy. 
[00:55:30]  It's not a bad guess.  Because they're not going to get a real celebrity to do it, but they'll try to get the closest  thing.  It's probably the naked cowboy.  Right.  Yesterday afternoon, the fugitive called Lisa Page, so now we're up to yesterday.  Oh, this is the second call from Lisa.  And this happened maybe an hour after we smashed them to bits.  Okay.  Yeah.  I got it.  Ninety-two-three now.  I just got a text from Brian.  Tell the fugitive he needs to give us some info, gender and age.  Speaking of the fugitive.  Hello, fugitive. 
[00:56:00]  How are you?  I'm doing pretty good.  How are you doing, Lisa?  I am doing fabulous.  Really?  Maybe you need to go back out on the sidewalk.  No.  No, no, no.  I've learned my lesson.  I promise you.  No more sidewalking for me.  Because that was so tragic.  Wow.  So many people saw.  They think she likes Barry Manilow now.  I know.  I know.  Crazy.  Can you imagine the humiliation?  I don't even know if she can walk around town anymore.  I know.  First of all, they don't even know what she looks like because no one gives a shit to even  care. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Eleven people saw her outside of that scene.  I know.  I know.  Crazy, isn't it?  This is crazy.  Tic Tac was one of them.  Because Barry Manilow is such a crazy artist.  Not so totally dorky.  Tic Tac's on.  He didn't even know what was going on.  He didn't know the average person on the street.  He didn't know who Lisa Page was.  I thought that it was a little sneaky that you had somebody taking pictures.  I looked.  I wanted there to be proof that I stuck to my word like you stuck to yours. 
[00:57:00]  I was watching from an alley.  I didn't realize you were filming me or I would have had my roots touched up.  Well, maybe it's just time to chuck it all and go for a new color.  But right now, listen, if I had a choice, something to lure me, afterwards, I'd go out  and grab me some sushi.  Sushi.  Okay.  Or not sushi.  What kind of roll?  I'll talk to Tic Tac at three.  What kind of sushi roll do you like? 
[00:57:30]  Can you give me a hint?  Tuna?  Temporum?  Nope.  Gotta go.  Philadelphia roll.  Philadelphia roll.  What?  Clack.  Seaweed salad?  Oh.  So the fugitive likes sushi.  And finally, the last clip.  I'm just tired now.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm physically exhausted.  It went from, like, starting the show and having fun with this to I'm just so fucking  annoyed.  I am annoyed.  I'm tired.  I'm upset.  You guys look like you don't want to be in a radio studio anymore. 
[00:58:00]  No, no.  No, I'm going back into tin knocking.  I want to go back into construction where there's at least some dignity.  And finally, the last call.  Last night, the fugitive calls Tic Tac.  Yeah.  Great.  What is it?  Simon, we got to take line five?  All right.  New York's new 92.3 now.  It is Tic Tac in the freak show.  Yes, Tora.  What?  Line seven.  All right, Simon.  What's up, man?  I don't know what's with that 92.3 now. 
[00:58:30]  $10,000 fugitive, dude.  That guy has some serious issues.  He keeps on leaving clues, but nobody ever finds him.  So what good are the clues if nobody can find them?  The fugitive is on the private line.  You know what?  I'm going to ask him about the Facebook.  Hey, what's the deal about your Facebook fugitive?  What's the deal with my face?  What the hell is that supposed to mean?  Facebook.  Oh, I went and I looked, and as of last night, I had 495 friends.  Just don't want to make it any easier for having fun, but I've got something really good. 
[00:59:00]  Are you familiar with Google?  Yes.  Okay, for the Google nuts out there, here's something good.  Google.  On the stage at Juilliard is a place that I've stood.  Ooh.  Pretty good.  On the stage at Juilliard, a place that I've stood.  And speaking of standing, I've got to run.  Have a good night.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  New York News. 
[00:59:30]  Right in with the fucking...  Oh, God.  So we're one step closer to finding the fugitive.  Someone who's went to school at Juilliard, I guess?  He's been on the stage.  Been on the stage at Juilliard.  Orange.  He's been on TV.  I could give a shit.  Oh, you don't care at all?  I couldn't give a shit.  Or I could, or I couldn't.  I don't even know.  I can't imagine anyone would give a shit that listens to their station.  There's no reason for this.  Why would you care?  Because they want to know how does somebody get away with this crime of the century. 
[01:00:00]  How about...  Look, we're going to give...  Time and time again.  $10,000 away and we'll tell you when to fucking call.  Seventh caller gets $10,000.  There you go.  Something like that.  We'll just...  Give away some money.  Just give it away.  Play your stupid Lady Gaga on your commercial-free Mondays, which basically means, holy shit,  we can't sell advertising.  Yeah.  Oh.  Keith J. from Niagara Falls, you stupid fuck.  He writes a bunch of Zs.  Why do you think we want to fucking hear this shit at all, let alone for an hour? 
[01:00:30]  You just did, you dumb fuck.  Yeah, you listened.  Shut it, you stupid dick.  Want to take a break?  There's a difference between just playing it and exposing radio for the shithole that it's become.  The fucking...  The hole full of shit that it has become.  Ugh.  Phones are just lit.  What college has a study hall?  That's a great question.  Yeah, there you go.  Steve and Georgia, go up to Harlem and start tapping people on the shoulder and ask them if they're the fugitive. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  We should start a rumor that the fugitive is up in the 120s.  Oh, you better take line five quick.  Really?  Yeah.  The $5 fugitive is calling back?  Hello?  Good morning.  This is the $5 Sirius 197 fugitive calling.  You're early.  I did not anticipate that my call would be taken at this time.  Well, we want our $5 back. 
[01:01:30]  We sure do.  Oh, we're going to catch you, sir.  Do you have a clue?  Um, the first clue is that I took the $5 from somebody who sounds like a disease.  A virus.  A virus.  Wow.  We're not supposed to answer the clues.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, that would be dumb.  You've got to let the listeners try to figure it out.  Well, that's a gimme.  That it's the virus's money. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Wow, $5.  Is that his pocket money?  Yeah.  No wonder he ran out of pocket money.  Pocket money?  Pocket money.  Because the fugitive stole it.  The fugitive stole the virus's pocket money.  He couldn't buy his figurines.  Yeah.  That's why he doesn't have Mossman in his collection.  Oh, fugitive.  What have you wrought?  What have you wrought?  You're a monster.  You are.  Heartless.  Let's keep the fugitive on the line, and then maybe we can trace the call.  Trace the call.  Fugitive, what else is going on? 
[01:02:30]  What's new?  I have nothing.  All right, I'm saying it's Steve.  All right, let's take a break.  Yeah.  God damn.  That is horrible.  We have Tony Clifton coming in today.  I don't know what to make of this.  Tony Clifton.  I don't want to tell people who it is.  He's Tony Clifton.  Yeah, Tony Clifton.  He's a fugitive. 
[01:03:00]  It was a classic Andy Kaufman bit.  I can tell you that much.  Yeah.  But then somewhere along the way, there was a switcheroo, and Andy Kaufman wasn't playing  Tony Clifton anymore.  And then Andy Kaufman passes, dies, and this guy continued the whole Tony Clifton thing.  Yeah.  Tony Clifton.  He's been doing it for over 20 some odd years, and he's coming in today.  He's a very famous Vegas lounge singer.  He's a complete nightmare, because he stays in character the entire fucking time, and  he's out of his mind. 
[01:03:30]  We should try to get him to break character.  That'll be our thing today.  I don't think he will.  Look up Tony Clifton clips if you want to be involved with the segment.  Moon Goose McQueen.  Huh?  Is he like Moon Goose McQueen?  Oh, yeah.  He's like Mule Juice.  We were going to Mule Juice McQueen.  Tony Clifton's like Dice, like an old version of Dice, where he comes in like a fucking  hurricane.  This Tony Clifton will come in like a hurricane.  And we'll just fuck the show up?  Yeah, I guess his entourage is 12 people and growing. 
[01:04:00]  What?  And he refuses to come up here unless he can bring all 12 people with him.  He's got his demands.  Yeah.  He's very famous.  Great.  You don't want to deal with this.  I'm so excited.  No, because now I'm exhausted from the first segment.  Right.  Yeah, because that was supposed to kind of be fun and then it just got really just infuriated.  To see all those lame YouTube clips of fake press conferences and shit.  Well, I can't wait for 10 o'clock when the fugitive calls 92.3 now. 
[01:04:30]  I'll be listening.  Will ya?  I'm going to try to figure it out.  We've got to blow up their spot somehow.  I can't wait until 8.17 when our fugitive calls.  He didn't expect us to pick up.  He knows he's going to sit there on hold for fucking 5, 10 minutes.  Well, that's a clue.  Must be someone that calls the show a lot.  Ah.  Knowing they have to hold for a while before they get on the show.  Wow.  Huh?  That's a good one. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  We'll break and we'll get into some other shit next.  Opie and Anthony.  Come on in.  What about this one?  I know you're not a Zeppelin guy for the most part.  There are some that I'll leave on.  Listen to this.  No, this one's good.  You all right with this?  Yeah, and then the drums. 
[01:05:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Stupid Rich Voss called in sick.  It's a big opportunity to fill in for Norton and he calls in sick today, that dummy.  Good.  That dummy.  Good, good.  We'll need ya.  We've got Jim Norton doing Leno tonight.  Let's make sure we all take a peek.  Help out Jimmy.  Yeah.  And we got Tony Clifton coming in at 9 o'clock.  We really don't know how to handle this one.  He's going to be in character. 
[01:06:00]  I mean.  Yeah, he's exhausting.  We're not going to do like a fucking fake radio thing with you guys.  He's in character.  We're going to.  I don't even know what we're supposed to do.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of Andy Kaufman big time.  Andy Kaufman stuff.  And certainly Bob Zemuda, who did a lot of bits with Andy Kaufman.  And he plays the Tony Clifton character.  You're not going to know that today.  Because he's going to come in like a hurricane, smoking and drinking.  What the hell is going on?  All right.  With an entourage.  You know, I guess other radio shows just go along with it. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know what to do.  I'm going to ask him if he's the fugitive.  That's a good idea.  We might be done with the fugitive bit.  Me and Dan were talking.  It was fun for the first like 45 minutes.  And then I just got so annoyed.  I just had to tap out of the whole fucking segment.  I got aggravated and tired.  I really got so fucking aggravated.  I got aggravated and exhausted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I don't know when Tony Clifton comes in.  I'm a fan, though.  I am.  During the breaks, if you want to like, you know, do some YouTube and check out some Tony 
[01:07:00]  Clifton shit.  So then you understand Tony a little better if you don't know who he is.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Master Poe's in the paper today.  Did you notice that?  What?  Yeah.  One of our old security guys, Master Poe, is in the newspaper today.  Uh-oh.  He's living in Seattle now.  No.  Would-be ninja impelled by metal fence.  This has to be Master Poe.  It has to be.  Seattle police say an intoxicated man who told officers he believed he was a ninja was impaled 
[01:07:30]  on a metal spike Monday night after a failed attempt to jump a five-foot fence.  Around 11.15 p.m., a 41-year-old man called police to say he had been assaulted.  Said police spokesman, whatever.  Officers arrived and found the impaled would-be ninja.  It turns out the older man, who was heavily intoxicated, tried to go, is this too inside? 
[01:08:00]  Is this too inside?  Yeah, what did he do?  It turns out the older man, who was heavily intoxicated, tried to go into a sports bar in  the 600 block of whatever, King Street.  Uh, the younger man, who isn't a bar employee, uh, barred the man from going inside, and an  argument between the two men escalated into a fight.  At one point, the men chased each other in the street, she said.  In an attempt to get away, the younger man thought he'd basically be able to jump over  this fence, and he didn't quite make it.  As a police account of the incident notes, clearly he was overconfident in his abilities. 
[01:08:30]  Where did he get, uh, impaled?  I don't know yet.  I didn't read that far.  That's when the older man called police.  As police, uh, arrived to search for a suspect, one officer heard the 25-year-old screams  and found him stuck on the fence with the metal spike jutting out from his buttocks.  No way!  Buttocks!  He got caught on the buttocks?  Yes, they said buttocks.  Ow.  Uh, which said the man was bleeding profusely.  Uh, question at the hospital, the man told police he believed he was a ninja. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, yeah, a ninja could do that.  And he really thought he could jump over a four- or five-foot fence and realize that he could not.  Some people could not.  Not him.  So, there you go.  There's the ninja story for everybody today.  Oh, and it's one of those, uh, obviously one of those, like, wrought iron with the spikes on top.  Right.  By the way, Ann, I didn't see you.  When you were talking about Curb Your Enthusiasm yesterday, I did not see it until last night. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, you didn't?  Holy fuckaroony.  Yeah, that's some sick shit.  Holy fuckaroony.  The cunt joke was classic.  The cunt joke was really funny.  And Jerry's face when he tells...  Holy...  Yeah, telling Jerry who...  The beauty of that...  Who is it?  It's, uh...  It's, uh...  What's his name in comedy?  Uh, Super Dave...  Was that the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Super Dave Osborne.  Super Dave Osborne.  If you haven't seen Curb yet, I don't know what you're doing, man.  Curb this year is really good with the whole Seinfeld reunion. 
[01:10:00]  Yep.  And they're getting close to filming the Seinfeld reunion as far as, you know, Curb Your Enthusiasm goes.  Well, one episode left.  Dude, I was telling my girl, I'm like, could you imagine if the last episode,  they'd just do a fucking Seinfeld episode?  That would be...  That would be interesting.  They're obviously not going to do that, but can you imagine they just said, well, here it is?  Here's a real reunion show.  Because they were doing dialogue, and you're like, they're fucking doing Seinfeld 11 years later.  It was kind of cool to see.  And it was really good stuff.  It was like modern day, you know, Bernie Madoff shit and all sorts of other stuff going on in the world. 
[01:10:30]  I like the Seinfeld Newman segment.  Yes!  Where they're laughing and shit at some of the lines.  Jerry, of course, couldn't stop laughing, as he did anyway during the show.  Super Dave, so he's friends with Larry David, and he's invited on the set, or he invites himself,  and he decides Jerry Seinfeld needs to hear this joke.  And what's great about that is, like I said, Jerry Seinfeld is the cleanest comic to ever do comedy, basically.  And Super Dave tells the fucking dirtiest joke I think I've ever heard. 
[01:11:00]  It's really...  It's not even like a funny joke.  Right.  But it's so filthy, it's funny.  Yeah.  It's just a funny joke.  And the way he told it was perfect.  Right.  I don't want to tell the joke in case people are still trying to fucking see that episode.  I'm like, that's awesome.  Because they're just making fun of themselves.  Yeah.  And then fucking Kramer and the black guy.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, no.  Holy shit.  Like, it was two years...  He goes, it was two years ago, don't hurt me.  Well, you gotta explain that scene.  So Michael Richards, a black guy, bangs on his door, part of the episode, whatever.  And Michael Richards answers and says,  He just goes, ah, it's been two years, don't hurt me.  It was pretty goddamn funny.  And then the woman's daughter that has the...  The nine-year-old daughter.  Has an itchy pussy?  She goes, yeah, she has an itchy pussy. 
[01:12:00]  She's nine.  And then Seinfeld.  Then Larry David becomes, you know, like a text friend of the little girl.  And you can only imagine what, you know, he's texting to her.  It is innocent, but if you are watching Larry David do it like some people in the episode were,  they're like, what the fuck?  He's a pedo.  Really good episode, man.  Yeah, that's some funny shit, man.  And them just sitting around the table doing a table read, I'm like, you're watching Seinfeld.  Yeah.  They don't... 
[01:12:30]  These guys don't want to commit to an actual reunion.  So this is the next best thing, I guess.  But you really were watching real Seinfeld shit.  That's the closest you get.  The closest you're gonna get.  What the fuck with that?  The hat that went here.  You made a jump out of me!  Oh, yeah, you gotta...  When he's arguing with a black guy and everybody is holding up their cell phones and filming it.  Yeah.  Keith J. from Niagara Falls.  Didn't I yell at you, Keith?  Did I yell at Keith?  And he's back.  That's strong.  Keith, that's strong. 
[01:13:00]  The kid's pussy comments made us cringe.  Yeah, it was kinda...  Oh, it was cringy.  I kinda cringed.  Cause it was...  Cause Larry goes, what's wrong with your daughter?  And the mom goes, oh, she's got an itchy pussy.  Like, who would ever say that?  It was great.  It was funny as shit.  Who would ever say that?  Anyway.  Yeah, I finally saw it.  I was just out of my mind.  It was great.  And I guess there's only one left.  Next week, last one.  They're doing, like, I guess the filming of the episode.  Right.  And some of the scenes look pretty cool on the previews. 
[01:13:30]  Do you think this is a way for Jerry and the guys to kinda get a feel if, you know, a reunion  show or...  If people wanted to see one?  Or if they came back for a couple seasons, if there would be...  Nah.  They wouldn't.  They just wouldn't do that.  Oh, man.  It's funny.  And you realize what a fuckin'...  I think it really is their characters, because you realize what a prick Jason Alexander is.  Yeah.  Like, he's just a prick.  Right.  He's not George.  Oh, no.  He's just a prick.  Yeah.  By the way, I know it's J.B. Smoove. 
[01:14:00]  Thank you, Booger Couch.  J.B. Smoove.  J.B. Smoove.  Yeah.  He's a comedian.  A very funny fucking guy.  Yeah, he's good on that show, too.  I would love to get him on our radio show.  In other Opie and Anthony news, see, sometimes the bitching helps, Ant.  Yeah.  Sometimes it helps.  My God, Opie.  Sometimes the bitching helps.  I was done.  A lot of listeners tweeting all night long, for real, going,  congratulations.  You are now pretty much front and center on the Sirius XM website. 
[01:14:30]  We have moved from completely off the page to, well, if you haven't listened, Sirius XM  satellite radio's website, when you go to it, it has all the channels, or a lot of the  popular channels, kind of stacked up in that, the way the screens are in the situation room  kind of a thing.  It's basically two, four, six by three.  Yeah.  So there's 18 channels that are featured as soon as you go to the website. 
[01:15:00]  And then there's others.  Off.  Yeah.  Off, off, if you understand how to scroll.  It's a little complicated, to be honest with you, but there are other channels you could  get to.  And originally, me and Ant were tucked in the corner with NPR and Bob Edwards.  And you couldn't see us on the front page when it gets there.  So you would just look at that, and how many people, what's the percentage of people that  are actually going to search out what's on the peripheral edges of those virtually stacked  screens?  That's what I was explaining to Bladder yesterday.  I'm like, look, a lot of people will go to the website. 
[01:15:30]  After that, the numbers dropped drastically to search any further than that.  Yes.  That's just how it is.  Now, Howard is featured prominently front and center right in the middle of the screen.  Right.  And then there are other things, Sinatra, NFL, Major League Baseball, Oprah, E Street  Radio, NASCAR, Elvis.  And then there was, like, Classical.  And we were way off.  Jazz standards.  We weren't even seen.  No. 
[01:16:00]  So we bitched about it, and they moved our logo.  Right.  And if you click on it, it's a link.  It gives you a little synopsis of our show and stuff.  But where they moved it was onto one of the squares that are half on and half off the  screen.  And the people that worked for the channel, they were very excited they were able to get  that done.  But it read I-E and O-N-Y.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever that means.  I-E and O-N-Y is what you saw.  Yesterday.  So we yelled and screamed again. 
[01:16:30]  Yes.  And they moved us over.  We're touching how we're now.  To a box.  They moved us over to the right.  Now we are in the first screen.  We're right there on the lower left-hand corner.  But as I'm looking at it, if they switched us with the rock one-  I would like that.  We would be center on there.  I would like that a lot.  I appreciate the effort now putting us there.  It's good.  We're on there. 
[01:17:00]  You go there.  You see the Opie and Anthony show.  But your eye is drawn to the center of the screen.  And I just think changing it with rock and then putting rock where we are would be fine.  But I kind of would like that position.  I personally would like to switch spots with Howard Stern.  You want that center position?  You think it's in his contract that our logo is not supposed to touch his logo?  Well, what are we, corner to corner now?  We are corner to corner.  Corner to corner.  And I bet you that doesn't make him happy.  I think the rock one should be moved. 
[01:17:30]  That's, yeah.  So we're on the front page, which is nice.  So I guess today, Anthony, we pet the dog.  Pet the dog.  Pet the dog.  You did good.  You did good.  Go get the peanut butter.  Come on, come on.  He had the biscuit resting on his nose the whole time.  And now we go, okay, get it.  Yep.  Yeah.  Yep.  But the company's still stupid.  Because, I mean, I'm helping us, but I'm also trying to help the company. 
[01:18:00]  The NHL logo, home ice should be front and fucking center.  Hey, don't tell them that.  They'll move us now off the screen again.  There's a few other logos they can move.  Trust me.  Get the NHL home ice up there because people need to know they can get hockey on Sirius XM.  That's huge.  Lucky.  For hockey fans.  Yep.  You can check out all sorts of games any night of the week.  It's amazing.  Yes.  Yeah, see, they actually moved us, though.  So today we pet the dog.  Two moves. 
[01:18:30]  Huh?  Two moves.  One, which we weren't, you know, totally happy with.  And now that's good.  It's good.  Now we like it.  We just like it.  We're not jumping up and down.  We're happy.  No, no.  That's, you know why?  We're happy.  You know why we're happy but not jumping up and down?  Because that's where it should have been in the first place.  And then we would have said we should be in the middle.  And you know how these motherfuckers spin shit?  They're going to be like, look, see?  Took care of you.  No.  And it's right.  You should have taken care of us to begin with.  You should have been there day one. 
[01:19:00]  So now we're just kind of where we're supposed to be.  Right.  And now we need to move forward from here.  So we're not going to give this extra ecstatic feel for what it is because that's where it belongs.  Right.  I can't take Howard calls today.  I've pushed it as much as I can for now.  I've got to take a break.  No.  We'll pet the dog.  I've got to take a break.  We're petting the dog today.  Pet the dog.  All right, Ant. 
[01:19:30]  What else is going on?  You know, it's kind of a slow news day, to be completely honest with you.  Is it?  Yeah, it's dumb stuff.  Like Rolling Stones are going to be performing at the Super Bowl.  I mean, not the Rolling Stones.  I thought the Who.  I'm sorry.  Rolling Stones says.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Well, the Who was denying this a couple days ago.  Now I guess it is confirmed they are playing the Super Bowl.  Well, actually, it's Peter Townsend and Roger Daltrey.  There's no.  With a lot of young guys around him.  Whereas the Who is gone. 
[01:20:00]  And I bet you some black fucking young singers to really help Roger's voice.  Help Roger out with the high notes.  I mean, how old are those guys?  Do you want to see the Who still?  50, 60 years old.  I gave up wanting to see the Who maybe 10 years ago.  Although I'm crying over here.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  I was by the Photogs.  Shut it.  You think Bruce Kelly will be at the Super Bowl?  Oh, Bruce Kelly will be there.  Oh, my God.  Peter Townsend looks like an old vicar.  Holy shit.  He looks like an old blind guy. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  That's what they look like now?  Oh, my God.  Oh, I'm so.  This fucking time sucks.  And look at, look at, look at Zaltrey's mic.  This time fucking blows.  Zaltrey's mic is still all taped up.  So, you know, he spins it around.  Are we seeing what looks like a flapjack tit hanging down?  From Roger Daltrey's chest.  Remember, he used to wear his shirt open at Woodstock.  He had a little fringe vest on.  He was there.  Now you can see, look at that line.  I'd rather not.  Right there. 
[01:21:00]  It is old man flapjack tit.  I was a big Who fan, too.  This is depressing.  And who's playing drums?  Some young kid.  Yeah, what is that?  I don't know.  I'm more depressed than Pete Towns, though.  He's wearing a hat.  Jimmy would like that.  Yeah.  If it was full of marmalade.  Oh, God.  What are they going to sing?  Huh?  What are they going to do?  They got to do a safe song.  They can't do Who the Fuck Are You?  They got to do just one of their hits. 
[01:21:30]  It's all about the hits.  Yeah.  It can't be a long song, so it's got to be a couple short ones.  What a shame.  Do a little fucking Magic Bus or something.  It has to have some kind of Super Bowl theme.  Does it?  I don't know.  So you got that going on.  And then other stuff.  Obama was at the Great Wall of China.  How did that work out for him?  I don't know.  Was he bowing to people?  That's a big controversy, by the way.  Because he was bowing in China, I guess. 
[01:22:00]  And they say American presidents, it's been traditional that they shake hands.  They don't bow.  It's customary.  Or hold hands.  Or hold hands.  Because that clip is everywhere again.  I know.  I was holding hands.  Holding hands, having a little walk in the Rose Garden.  Holding a grown man's hand.  Yeah.  I don't care.  I don't care that's a custom.  You just didn't.  That is stupid.  You shouldn't be caught holding hands with an older gentleman.  Look at him. 
[01:22:30]  That just looks so gay.  You got to have some kind of agreement behind closed doors.  Like, look, I understand it's your custom, but you do understand I can't walk across the  lawn holding your hand.  I'm not going to hold your hand.  The press is here.  And it's not the fake press.  It's not the fugitive press.  No, no.  This is the real press.  He's holding his hand.  But the thing is, Obama is...  Look at Bush, though.  He's not comfortable.  His shoulder's up.  How do you get when you're, like, uncomfortable?  Like, oh, my hand.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Why are you still holding my hand?  I said, yeah, you can hold it for, like, three seconds.  Yeah.  Like when your chick goes to grab your hand in front of your friends or something.  Well, I think I told a story, but I made the mistake, you know, Kenny...  We all like to kind of play practical jokes on each other and shit here and there.  So we're going through the airport.  I'm sure I told this.  So I thought it'd be funny to, like, hold Kenny's hand and make people uncomfortable.  But my comfort zone was I could handle holding Kenny's hand for maybe five seconds, maybe 
[01:23:30]  as we walk through one gate.  And then it becomes very uncomfortable.  Because now Kenny goes, oh, you want to play?  And then he grabs on with a death grip and walks you through the entire airport holding  your hand and refuses to let go.  And now you're like, all right.  And now you're with Kenny, let go of my fucking hand.  Now it's like you're having a tiff.  Having a little tiff with Kenny.  He got me fucking mad.  That's embarrassing.  And, of course, the famous Danny star.  He got me really bad at the Mets game, thinking I'm holding my chick's hand. 
[01:24:00]  And it was Danny's as I walked out of the place.  Yeah, they fooled you.  That was bad.  I agree with...  Oh, yeah?  You want to go with this?  Let's say hi to Steve in Michigan.  Steve.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I was...  Tonight on Hannity, Sarah Palin is going to be on in a clip that she taped a couple of  days ago or maybe yesterday or something about how the Fort Hood shooting was indeed an act  of terrorism and that not acknowledging that the media is just being PC and that it's run 
[01:24:30]  amok.  And I thought Ann ought to know that the only support that he's getting on the national  stage for his opinion is coming from this halfway.  Well, I mean, you know, we beat her up pretty good yesterday, but, you know, good for Sarah  Palin saying that.  Good for her.  Yeah, that's...  You know...  Good fucking for her.  That's obvious.  Yeah.  You know, I just don't like her.  And I wasn't trying to make it political yesterday.  She just drives me nuts.  Yeah.  I hate that.  I hate her.  I hear the voice.  I hear the book. 
[01:25:00]  Like, they had to, like, discount the price or something.  It's selling for $8 at Walmart or something.  Really?  But it's confusing because, I mean, I don't...  The news is confusing because, you know, you watch Fox and they're rah-rah about her  book.  You watch CNN and they're laughing because, oh, look, they had to discount the book just  to get people to buy it.  So it's like...  It's so frustrating.  I just want the news.  Out here in West Michigan, I mean, she's in Grand Rapids today, which is where I'm at, 
[01:25:30]  and she's, you know, this is a really Republican stronghold area over here, and there's  a line out the door of the store she's going to appear at today.  But you've got to buy a ticket to her to get her wristband to come back and get her to  sign the frickin' book later tonight.  Maybe the line is just a mile long.  Yeah, it's definitely selling.  Oh, yeah.  People are buying it.  There is an interest out there.  They want to see what the fuck she's about.  For this rogue politician.  Oh, rogue.  She's got some fuckin' sweet legs, though.  I've got to give it to her. 
[01:26:00]  I've been looking at these pictures.  When are these from?  She's got some sweet legs and a nice ass.  This is from an issue of Runner's World magazine.  Really?  And how long ago was this?  Not that long ago.  Maybe like three months.  No, she's all right in the leg department and the ass department.  She's looking good.  The librarian look for me is not a sweet look.  You're into the librarian look there, Danny?  Oh, yeah.  Great time.  Yeah, man.  I think I'm not into it because it's always...  Tina Fey style?  Hell yeah.  Yeah, Danny likes the glasses and the...  It's a hot look, man. 
[01:26:30]  Really?  Yeah.  You don't think so?  I hate the face.  It's blowing up.  I was reading on one of those shitty gossip sites.  Like some chick wore glasses in a Playboy photo shoot, so now all of a sudden all these  hot chicks are wearing glasses.  I couldn't be happy.  Well, it's got to be believable, though.  I mean, we've all seen the porn where she's the librarian, but she has huge, over-the-top,  fuckin' tight breasts.  Yeah, yeah.  Her hair is off.  Pushing out of the blouse.  It's just like...  Yeah, the hair's got to be up.  With the porn star bleach blonde hair. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Could you at least make it a little believable?  With a pencil in her hair, holding it there, and then she takes it out and waves her hair  around.  She's already giving the pencil head.  It's like, all right.  Some girls look good in glasses.  I'll agree with you.  Others, not so much.  Right.  Sarah Palin's book is number one on Amazon.  There you go.  There's news for you.  Thank you, Steve.  And as soon as we said Sarah...  You're welcome.  As soon as we said Sarah Palin, Blue Heeler writes,  No! 
[01:27:30]  With a lot of O's.  Yeah.  Let's go to Vinny in Red Bank.  Vinny!  Hey, good morning, fellas.  How are you?  Pretty good, man.  I just want to let you guys know, the drummer for The Who is Ringo Starr's son, Zach Starkey.  Oh, really?  Oh, it is Zach?  Yeah.  He's actually been their drummer longer than Keith Moon was their drummer.  Wow.  How's that for age?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  He's been their drummer since like the early 90s.  He's actually pretty good.  That would be better than his old man.  What happened to that other guy?  What was the name of the drummer that took over after Keith Moon died? 
[01:28:00]  Keith Jones from the...  What?  Keith Jones.  Kenny Jones.  Yeah, Kenny Jones.  What happened to Kenny Jones?  Yeah.  Kenny Jones.  Is he dead?  No idea.  I don't think so.  Because he was on a couple of their albums and shit.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Wait for the Faces reunion with Rod Stewart, I guess.  Is that happening?  Now.  Nah.  Yeah, I don't know.  Enough old geezer rock.  And how old is Zach Star now?  Zach Star, he's probably young in his 40s, I would imagine. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Ringo's almost 70.  I'm reading a...  44.  I'm reading a John Lennon book.  It's 970-something fucking pages.  Of what?  And it's everything I hate about biographies.  Remember how we talked...  Oh, when they start...  Well, when...  Biography about the parents.  Yeah.  Or like, I don't care about it where his parents were fucking born.  Parents, how about...  The John Lennon book starts with his grandfather, who used to be in minstrel shows and traveling  to America.  Really good.  So there was some foreshadowing. 
[01:29:00]  Another guy...  Supposedly, he was like changing things...  Yeah.  ...back in the whatever, the 1800s or whatever it would be.  And then it's like, when John Lennon was 2, I'm like, will you just get to fucking...  No one cares about...  When they kicked out Pete Best, why did they kick him out?  Yeah.  Playing at the Cavern.  Right.  And, uh, yeah, Stu Sutcliffe dying and all this shit.  Yeah, get to that.  Get to the good stuff.  The lovable...  Lovable liver puddlians.  Yes, that's what I say. 
[01:29:30]  Get to that part.  The teddies.  You know what a teddy is, Ant?  What's a teddy?  Oh, they were...  They were scary characters in...  Were they?  ...in London.  And Liverpool.  Liverpool.  They, uh, they were like gangs.  They were scary.  And John Lennon dressed like a teddy.  Teddy?  Yeah.  Wow, a teddy.  Yeah.  Never heard of it, sir.  All right, Vinny, thank you, sir.  No problem, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, yeah, why not?  Let's go to Tony in Boston.  Hey, Tony.  Tony.  Hey, good morning, guys. 
[01:30:00]  Good morning.  Hey, when I was in Iraq last year, one of my jobs was dealing with all the shakes, and so I'm  walking down a front lawn with one of his shakes, and the guy grabs my hand like it's queer  or something.  So I kind of gave him a douche-chill look, and so he asked me what my problem was, and  so I started explaining to him that, you know, this is kind of a gay thing to do, and that  in America, you know, it means one man wants to put his penis in the other man's butt.  So I turned to the side, and there's a fucking camera crew right there, and it turns out it 
[01:30:30]  was Nova from PBS, and a couple of my guys that worked for me told me they saw it on the  internet, and that there I am explaining to this guy, gay sex, about it, and completely  made America look like we were just, you know, a bunch of three warriors there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck him.  You don't want to be holding some fucking guy's hand as you're walking around.  No, it's not fun.  Looking all badass. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I kind of took away from all the guns I had on me and stuff.  I felt a little weird.  Yeah, all of a sudden, you're just fucking brought down a chick.  You're being a chick for the guy.  Well, I'll tell you what, you drive around any of the cities over there, and there's  just tons of guys walking down the street.  They got their holding hands.  They got their arms around each other.  What the fuck is going on over there?  Yeah, why don't they like girls?  There is this underlying fucking gayness going on over there that just... 
[01:31:30]  But it's completely accepted.  Yeah, but it's not...  We did a whole show on that.  What are the little boys called?  It's like accepted to have a little boy, and you hold his hand, and he provides a service.  Oh, he certainly does, I bet.  But what is the service they say he provides?  It's a whole weird thing, that culture.  Companionship?  No, it was some other fucking thing.  I forgot.  Oh, God.  Jesus, Danny.  All right, Danny.  Danny's fucking veered off into some really nasty man-on-man action. 
[01:32:00]  Danny, Danny, what did I do?  Danny, we were all with you when it was pictures of guys holding hands, but we don't really need to see this.  Now he's showing power moves.  What the fuck?  Only two guys can fuck like that.  Why would you?  All right, Tony.  Thank you, sir.  All right, fellas.  Have a good day.  Yeah, you too.  Hey, Ann, we're going to take a break.  After the break, it was some audio we should have played yesterday.  What is that? 
[01:32:30]  Actually, there's two really good, they're very similar, actually.  You got Rob Schneider getting into a huge fight on a morning show.  Mm-hmm.  Really good, uncomfortable audio.  And there's Robert Patterson from Twilight, walks off Ryan Seacrest's show.  Why?  We were just talking about this.  And it happened to Ryan Seacrest because a publicist didn't like the line of questioning what Ryan Seacrest was asking.  What could Ryan Seacrest be asking someone that a publicist wouldn't want?  And wouldn't you just, well, you know something, with that whole Twilight thing, they know they don't have to promote this shit. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  It's just going to be huge.  But wait.  Wait a couple of years.  We can't allow publicists to take over radio shows.  And they'll be, you know what?  We've got to support Ryan Seacrest on this, obviously.  Oh, my God.  I never thought I'd do that.  No shit.  But how many times have we had, like, people pulled out of studio because of the line of questioning?  I want to know what he asked.  My God.  You want me to tell you now?  No.  No.  Let's wait until after the break. 
[01:33:30]  Because what he asked them is like, oh, whatever.  We'll get into it after the break.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Stay there.  We'll tell you.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Very excited.  Tony Clifton will be in studio within the hour.  He's crazy.  Oh, yeah.  So you want to find out about the Ryan Seacrest thing? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  I want to know what Ryan Seacrest could possibly ask somebody that a publicist would be mad at.  He's like Mr. Softball question guy.  Well, I think it needs a setup because I do watch TMZ and I watch some of these other  entertainment shows.  If you want to see ridiculous TV, take a peek.  Yeah.  I've watched it.  Here's the deal, Ant.  This Twilight movie is really big.  I'm not telling anything.  The little chicks like it.  Yeah.  It's a huge fucking franchise, right?  All these wannabe vampires. 
[01:34:30]  And I haven't seen one Twilight movie.  Is it good?  How many are they up to?  Is this the second one?  No.  It's like fucking...  I think this is the second one.  Second?  It's like...  It's like...  But have you seen it?  No, but I hear it's like the OC with vampires or, you know, fucking Gossip Girl with vampires  or any of those stupid shows.  But is it a good movie?  You know what I mean?  Like...  I submit to you no.  I was surprised when I started watching the Harry Potter movies how good they actually  were. 
[01:35:00]  And that's not crazy to say.  No.  I mean, the first one was a little kind of kid-like, but then they went for a larger audience.  They went more mainstream and they went darker.  A little darker.  And you know what?  I don't mind a Harry Potter movie at this point.  Is it the same thing with the Twilight movies?  Could someone please answer that question today?  All I know is they're all greeted by screaming tweens.  Wherever they go.  Screaming tweens.  We missed the boat on that.  What?  The tween? 
[01:35:30]  I wish tweens were yelling and screaming for us.  Yeah.  Instead of, you know...  They yell and scream.  Let me out of here.  Instead of what we got.  I mean, we love you guys, but let's be honest.  Yeah.  It'd be nice if there were some hot, nice-smelling broads around.  Fat, drunk, and stupid is not a good fan to have.  Mr. Blutarski.  So I need to know if the Twilight movie's worth seeing, being a guy that's pushing 40.  I can't even do it anymore. 
[01:36:00]  So here's the deal, Ant, because I've got to give it away.  Robert Pattison is in Twilight and Kristen Stewart.  Yeah.  And they're going out.  They are seeing each other.  Okay.  But they don't want to make it public.  Why?  This is my opinion, by the way.  Okay.  They don't want to make it public, but it's so obvious.  And everyone is trying to get the video of them really kissing.  They want an interview where they finally admit it, because that would be big for them. 
[01:36:30]  So Ryan Seacrest gave it a shot.  So this isn't outrageous.  This is everywhere.  Everybody's talking about it, so fuck it.  It's pretty obvious that they are seeing each other.  Maybe it's not good for the franchise if they're actually seeing each other, because you want  the girls to want Robert, and you want the guys to love Kristen.  Yes, and want to think they have a chance with them.  It's kind of like the Beatles thing, because I'm in the middle of the John Lennon book.  Just before fucking the Beatles hit, John Lennon marries that broad Cynthia.  Oh, right.  And she's pregnant.  That's why they get married. 
[01:37:00]  And no one was supposed to know that John Lennon was married, because that would be horrible  for the image of the Beatles.  He's got to be available.  Available to every screaming teenager out there.  So it's the same type of thing happening with this Twilight thing.  But it's obvious they're dating.  Yeah.  So Ryan Seacrest, you know, doing what everyone else is doing, trying to find out if they're  actually dating.  Mm-hmm.  That's why I was a little bit more nervous about this one than any of the others, because  it's kind of the finale of the press tour and everything, and you kind of, you have to  sort of please everybody. 
[01:37:30]  What do you say to your fans who are desperate to know about you and your co-star, Kristen?  What can you tell them?  What can you tell them about it?  I can tell them to watch New Moon because it's fantastic for me.  You can't ask that question to the guy?  It's his co-star.  It's a fair question.  Thank you very much.  I was just cut off for the first time ever.  The thing I can say to them is watch New Moon is amazing.  Hey, thank you. 
[01:38:00]  That's publicist.  I'm enraged.  My blood is boiling.  Did you hear it?  Let's go.  Let's go right now.  Let's go.  And Ryan Seacrest, sorry, you're pussed out, buddy.  Yeah.  Thank you?  You'd give him a thank you?  Yeah.  I would have said, fuck you and fuck your movie.  But I would have kept it clean because it's regular radio.  Tell your bitch handler to shut up.  I've got to hear that again.  If you want to answer the question, answer it.  If you don't, don't.  Were you going to let this fucking hag work you like a puppet? 
[01:38:30]  Is that what you're doing?  You're a puppet?  With her designer bag?  Yeah.  The publicist, they come around with the celebrity.  I had an incident yesterday.  Holy shit.  Okay.  They come with their designer bags and they sit outside the studio with their arms folded.  Yeah.  They don't understand that we're trying to entertain our audience.  As soon as it gets a little crazy, they yank him out of the studio.  Dude, Cheech and Chong on the way out.  Yeah.  Did you see what the publicist?  She was annoyed that I stopped him in the hall.  What?  I just saw him and I went, hey, Cheech and Chong. 
[01:39:00]  And they're like, hey.  Well, one of the guys goes, oh, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Like, he recognized us.  So I go, hey, what's up?  And I stopped him in the hall.  I go, hey, did you do Unmasked with, you know, Ron Bennington?  And they're like, yeah.  I'm like, how did it go and stuff?  And I'm like, where are you going now?  And they said some show.  And the publicist goes, yeah, yeah.  They got to go right now.  She's getting all annoyed.  I'm like, they were the ones that recognized us.  And we were having a couple minutes in the hallway together.  Publicists are the worst.  Because I was trying to, I wanted to ask him, hey, you have time to do our show. 
[01:39:30]  I know it didn't really work out yesterday, but we'd love to have you on the show.  And she was all annoyed that I was actually holding him up from another interview.  Lomy.  You want to hear this again?  And by the way, Danny, remind me to play this tomorrow for Jimmy.  I want to hear her go, oh, yeah, Jimmy, you'll lose his fucking mind.  Dude, I, you saw, no, no, no, come on, come on.  You saw me.  I wanted to punch my microphone.  And then I'm thinking, what is that going to do?  I really want her in the studio right now.  That's why I was a little bit more nervous about this one than any of the others. 
[01:40:00]  Because it's kind of the finale of the press tour and everything.  And you kind of, you have to sort of please everybody.  What do you say to your fans who are desperate to know about you and your co-star, Kristen?  What can you tell?  In all fairness to Ryan Seacrest, good question.  And if you don't want to answer it, that's what everyone is wondering.  So, you know, work your way out of it.  Work your way out of it then if you don't want to answer it.  To have her have to step in is so ridiculous.  Hold on.  What can you tell them about it? 
[01:40:30]  They can tell them to what she said.  What did she say?  Nope, nope.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Let's go.  Nope, nope.  Something like I told you not to talk about that.  You know what?  You were told not to.  You know what?  For every broadcaster that gets anybody from the Twilight on their show, just keep asking.  Yeah.  Because that's all anyone cares about.  You ask questions that you're hoping the audience cares about.  And watch the publicist lose her fucking mind.  At every interview.  Oh, would that be great?  What can you tell them about it? 
[01:41:00]  I can tell them to watch the new moon.  You can't ask that question?  You can't ask that question to the guy?  It's his co-star.  It's a fair question.  Thank you very much.  I was just cut off for the first time ever.  The thing I can say to them is watch the new moon.  It's amazing.  Hey, thank you.  I don't understand the thank you.  I don't understand the thank you.  Do we live in a different world?  Wouldn't that make you so pissed at it?  Maybe it was sarcasm?  No, not at all.  Thank you.  No, not at all.  He just lives in a different world. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  He's got to be nice, guy.  I would just be so annoyed.  He doesn't want to fucking jeopardize that American Idol money by being controversial.  You can't let the publicist get away with that shit.  American Idol money.  American Idol money would be nice money, huh, Ant?  So you sit there and you go, thank you.  What kind of money we got if he's got American Idol money?  Why am I looking at cock?  I don't know.  Danny, enough of the cock.  Travis just loves linking me to arbitrary images.  That one was Harry Potter.  That was Harry Potter in his equis cock.  Thank you. 
[01:42:00]  Big face.  We understand.  Jesus.  If he has American Idol money, what kind of money do we have?  Think of a show.  American Idol is the biggest show.  You guys have Soul Train money.  No, I'm thinking of it like a...  Fuck.  Fish.  Fish money.  We have the show, the spinoff from Barney Miller, Fish.  We have fish money.  Uh-oh, Anthony.  Yes?  Hi, who's this?  It is the Sirius 197 $5 fugitive calling. 
[01:42:30]  You're a little early.  Sirius runs on time.  Five minutes early is on time.  On time is late.  Oh, is that a clue?  Wow, it's some kind of riddle, Anthony.  Yeah, he's all full of clues.  Well, $5 fugitive.  Do you have a clue for us about where the money is?  Because you stole $5 of the virus's pocket money.  His pocket money.  And we need it back so we can give it to a listener.  And Iraq couldn't get, what, Moss Man, was it? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, Moss...  Fugitive is distracted by boobs.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  Fugitive says that money is left in drawer with mayo.  Hey, Fugitive, you had an hour to figure something out.  You had an hour.  You had an hour.  If you want to keep your bit going, how about you use the hour to figure something out?  Come up with a clue.  We might dance the virus. 
[01:43:30]  We know who it is.  You only got two more shots today, so you got an hour.  Figure it out.  Thank you, Fugitive.  He just laughs at his own fucking, his own laziness.  You got a bit.  Figure it out.  And what do you do?  Sit there scratching your nuts for an hour?  And they go, oh, fuck.  It's 8.15.  Let me...  Okay, here we go.  Blue Heeler again.  Right on.  Ope, I love the Harry Potter movies for the same reason as you.  And then he writes...  Jerking off. 
[01:44:00]  Jerking off.  Jerking off.  What do you use that for?  Jerking off.  And he goes, Twilight fucking blows.  Don't bother.  I think it's for, like...  Well, that's what I was wondering.  Yeah, but the Harry Potter movies were for kids and shit, but it got the older audience  involved.  I think it gets that, like, the same type...  Not the same audience, because they're older now, but that same type of audience that  first got into Buffy the Vampire Slayer and shit like that, you know?  Ooh, Buffy.  That I want to be a vampire, but it's not real.  Buffy ruled.  A kid thing, but then you got to go see it, so you, you know, you still have something 
[01:44:30]  to talk to your girlfriend about.  Oh, Danny.  Oh, Danny.  That's not nice.  Oh, now, Dan.  Jeremy in New Mexico.  Jeremy, spoken.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, I can tell you about this, uh, this fucking movie, um, Twilight.  Yeah.  All right.  My wife sits there and buys the book when it first comes out.  Yes.  And for the first two weeks, she could not fucking talk to me.  She had to stay in her room and read this bitch over and over again. 
[01:45:00]  I thought it was going to be a fantastic movie when it comes out, so I go watch the movie,  and then when I walk out of the movie, I feel like a bigger bitch than I came in, because  this, this movie sucks a dick.  It doesn't have any action.  It doesn't, the bitches are fine, but other than that, it's just, it's a terrible movie.  It's meant for fucking, like, like teens.  Right.  Yeah, it's, it's just.  It's a target audience.  All right.  Well.  They were doing mall tours.  They were taking the cast around to malls for appearances, and you know what that means. 
[01:45:30]  Just, and just screaming kids.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Okay, so maybe this whole fake relationship is just that fake.  They want people to think those two are going out.  Maybe.  It's kind of like the fugitive thing.  So then why doesn't he say.  You got to look at all the clues and try to figure it out.  Why doesn't he just say, well, you know, that's, draw your own conclusions.  That's my private life.  I'm here to talk about the movie, but, you know, thanks for asking. 
[01:46:00]  Sure.  You could, you could be diplomatic and shit.  You could get around it.  Without stupid fucking whore publicists.  Right.  That just are questioning, question cock blockers.  Right.  Let's go to Jennifer in Cleveland.  Jennifer.  Hey, how you guys doing?  I hear LeBron James says he could play in the NFL.  He could, actually.  You know, he was recruited by Ohio State.  Was he really?  Yeah, he really was.  I know one of his fellow high school guys there was a really good football player. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, at SDSM?  I don't know where.  Did his school have anything to do with an orange color?  Oh, very good.  I want to know.  Oh, yeah.  Just let's not go to the Browns, okay?  Yeah, the Browns are what?  What are they right now?  Oh, they're 1-8.  They are 1-8, right?  Wow.  They are 1-8.  You're a sports chick, huh?  But here's the difference.  I'm a big sports chick.  Here's the difference.  At least you know your fucking football team sucks this year.  See, we had all this hope in New York for Sanchez and the Jets going, 
[01:47:00]  wow, we got a pretty good shot at making the playoffs.  Next thing you know, we're suffering here.  And now the season's a bust.  And you got the fucking coach.  He's 340 pounds.  He's blubbering and crying like an idiot to his players.  Slubbering.  There's a whole article in it where he's in the Hall of Fame of crying with Mike Schmidt and the rest of them now.  Wow.  Unfortunately, there's no tape of him crying, though.  That is true.  With two bad knees.  I love that one.  Hey, Jennifer, hold on a line. 
[01:47:30]  We got a player.  We got a player, Mike Schmidt.  Mike Schmidt crying never gets old.  Hold on a minute.  No problem.  You're doing radio with us.  Enjoy.  Okay, I am.  Travis, you got that?  18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Aye, nigh.  My favorite part. 
[01:48:00]  I thank God the dream came true.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  What a girly cry that is.  True.  Game true.  Beauty who.  It was just about baseball, man.  When my dad died, I didn't cry like that.  I had a good cry, but I didn't sound like that.  No, you go.  Daddy.  Daddy. 
[01:48:30]  But we're about to get back on radio, Daddy.  You supported me for those two years.  Now, you died a week before we're supposed to be back on radio, Daddy.  I think you feel ridiculous at what you sound like, so you just stop crying, hold it in.  That fucking sucks, that death shit.  I want my dad so bad, I'll admit it. 
[01:49:00]  I didn't cry right off the bat when my dad died.  It was one of those things like I couldn't because there were too many people around.  You cried, though, huh?  I couldn't have fucking Anthony Comey cried?  Of course, it's my dad.  Nice.  Same thing.  When did you cry?  Well, here's what it is.  Hold on, Jennifer, we'll get to you.  We like your laugh track, though.  It's really getting us pumped.  He dies.  I'm at the bar because I'm with the ex-wife, and she's working.  This is when we first met.  At the bar.  Yeah, yeah.  She's working at the bar.  So I'm sitting at the bar after work, downing a few beers. 
[01:49:30]  My brother comes in, he's like, oh, I got bad news, blah, blah, blah.  That's how you found out?  Yeah, Joe came in, told me.  Oh, shit.  Where?  So, at the bar.  Broadway?  Yeah, off Broadway in Greenlawn.  So I'm sitting at the bar now going like, oh, wow, that fucking sucks.  So I'm drinking beer and stuff, and my brother has a beer, you know, just kind of like, wow,  I'm fucking shell-shocked and shit like that.  So then I wait till, you know, the ex gets off of work because I got to drive her home,  and I don't want to be in front of her because I didn't want any fucking comforting from her. 
[01:50:00]  So we go home and go to sleep.  Right.  Now we go to sleep, and then I had to get up and go to work the next day.  So I get up and go to work, and I couldn't, like, cry anywhere there and stuff.  I had to wait till I came home the next day, got home, went upstairs, and, like, shut the  door to my bedroom.  It was like, booty-hooty-hooty-hooty-hooty-hooty-ho.  Wait, was the wife home?  What?  Was she home?  No, the house was empty. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, okay.  I missed that part of something.  Yeah, I just didn't want anybody walking in.  No, comforting my ass.  Yeah, exactly.  So it was like, ooh-hoo-hoo.  Didn't have a good cry, though?  Not a good one because, like, for a little while, like, it was pretty intense for 10 seconds,  and then I was just like, I couldn't help thinking how silly I sound.  Yeah.  So I'm just like, all right, I go, I got to stop this.  I think I got it all out.  It was like 10 seconds.  That's it.  It was pretty intense, and then I just heard myself going like, ooh-hoo-hoo, and I was like, 
[01:51:00]  stop that.  You sound silly.  Dude, man.  Believe it or not, man is, you know, is made to cry.  But as a man, you're not supposed to cry.  I mean, in recent years, I guess it's a little more accepted.  Yeah.  A little more, but I don't know.  Dane Cook does a pretty good bit on, like, having a good cry, and he is 100% right.  When you get a good cry going, man, it feels fucking great. 
[01:51:30]  It might, you know why, because I think it exhausts you afterwards, and you just could  take a nap.  Yeah.  I remember the one time, though, I saw my father cry, and I was just awful.  That is the worst.  You don't want to see that.  He drove up in his Le Mans.  Actually, he wasn't even in it, because it had burnt up.  So, the hood, he opened the hood on the highway, and tried to get the fire out and burnt his  hands.  So, he came back to the house, and my mother's like, you know, all right, Joey, come here.  I'll rip you on.  And his hands are under the water. 
[01:52:00]  And now, I don't realize, but at the time, he's younger than I am now.  Jesus.  Like, way fucking younger.  Sure.  And I'm a little kid, and I just feel like, so I go downstairs to see what's the matter,  and there I'm watching my fucking dad, who is, you know, supposed to be at that age, the  do-all, be-all, end-all of men, and he's crying.  And I went, Daddy, are you okay?  And he turned around and goes, get the fuck out of here.  He yelled, get the fuck out of here, because he didn't want me seeing him cry. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, because that's not cool.  So, of course, I was like, yeah, I start crying, I run upstairs, I have a tummy ache,  I'm a fucking baby.  That's great.  Get the fuck out of here.  Thanks, Dad.  A little sympathy I'm trying to give you, and you tell me, get the fuck out.  My dad, I remember crying twice.  There's a good one, and there's a bad one.  Oh, no.  The good one was The Passion of the Christ.  Near the end of his life, by the way.  He wanted to see this movie.  He was like, my dad was very spiritual. 
[01:53:00]  He believed in some good shit.  You got to get high to really get into some of the stuff my dad believed in.  He believed in some shit.  There was some wacky stuff.  Oh, he believed in some good stuff.  Angels and aliens and all sorts of stuff.  He hated organized religion, but he was a religious guy.  Yeah.  He believed in near-death experience, all that shit.  Very spiritual.  So he wanted to see The Passion of the Christ, and I sat down there in Huntington,  that theater in Huntington, and he fucking bawled.  Holy shit, in the theater? 
[01:53:30]  Were you just looking around going like, holy fuck?  No, the whole theater was bawling, because it was like an afternoon showing,  so there was a lot of older people in there.  And the whole, like, the Virgin Mary having to watch Jesus getting beat.  You should have just yelled out, Jesus Christ!  I wanted to stand up so bad and go, we get it.  He got beat bad.  Yeah, not quite as esoteric as they would have you believe in other movies. 
[01:54:00]  And then the other one was, he was in a hospital bed.  You might want to turn off the radio.  Oh, no, no!  And he, oh my God, he was in there for his, like, 20th heart operation.  I lost track.  And the night before, the big heart operations with my dad were always intense,  because he didn't know if he was going to make it through.  And all of a sudden, he just started, I'm the last guy there.  It's, like, it's kind of dark.  How did you get last up?  I was, because he had to come to the city, to one of the VA hospitals, I think.  So it was tough for people to visit, but I was living in the city, 
[01:54:30]  so I went down there, and it was just me and him.  And it's just a cold winter night, and everyone else is gone.  And pretty much the staff is gone.  There's only one night nurse.  And all of a sudden, he's just crying in his bed as he's hooked up to all this stuff.  Oh, no.  He goes, what's, I go, what's wrong, Dad?  He goes, I just love you guys so much.  Oh, fuck.  How do you handle that, though?  You go, goodbye.  That's sort of what I was saying.  I'm like, Dad, it's going to be okay.  It's going to be okay. 
[01:55:00]  Run away from the situation.  Yeah, I try to get out.  I'm not even going to front.  I try to get out as quick as possible, because he was a tough guy.  He was one of these guys, like, ah, if I die tomorrow, you know, and one of those guys, ah, I'm ready if I die tomorrow.  But then when the real mortality was sinking in, where, like, you know, it was a possibility you'd die, yeah, fuck, you realize, no, you're not ready for that shit.  You're not ready for that shit.  Oh, I think I had one more episode, but it wasn't that bad of seeing my dad get emotional. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, by the way, the phones were lit.  Twilight sucks, okay?  We can move on from that fucking subject.  With this, um, oh, my parents, of course, having a giant argument.  I guess I was seven years old and, again, crying and all that happy horse shit.  And it was a big one.  I mean, they'd yell and scream.  And all us kids are just like, ah, crying.  It was just a big crying fucking yelling house.  God, the apartment above us must have hated us.  And, uh, and, like, my mother came out of the bedroom, because they were arguing in the bedroom. 
[01:56:00]  And then we're all crying, and she grabs the three of us, you know?  Yeah.  And she's like, oh, everyone's crying and stuff.  So I, like, pushed away and ran into the room where my father was, because I just thought, that's awful.  Like, he's in there, all upset and alone.  And, what, the three kids and my mom are out here, you know?  Right.  So I run into the room to, you know, be with a dear old dad.  And, uh, he, he was all, like, misty-eyed.  Oh, shit.  And then he goes, he goes, I just gotta tell you, you're, you, you're my, you're my favorite. 
[01:56:30]  I was different.  You're my favorite.  We were, we were both favorites.  I was the favorite.  You know what that meant?  Paying the mortgage for 10 years.  Thanks.  So glad I was your favorite.  My favorite is, holy shit.  How about, how about I'm second favorite?  And then I felt.  And you get the money from one of the other brothers.  But I felt guilty that I was the favorite.  So I felt all guilty.  And, uh, see, that didn't work out.  Parents gotta just shut their fucking mouths.  Shut your mouths with the kids. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, don't pick favorites.  Just be like, get me a beer.  Yeah, don't pick favorites.  Things like that.  Puts a lot of pressure on the little fella.  Help me fix the car.  That was, like, a big thing.  Like, uh, my dad was like, hey, Anthony, help me fix the car.  No, and I couldn't do shit.  I couldn't do exact shit.  So I was standing up on the bumper and kind of holding on to the grill, looking in.  And he's like, oh, yeah, I think it's something with the carburetor and stuff.  I go, what's that screw and stuff?  He goes, oh, yeah, let me try that screw.  He knew.  And I was like, oh, that's cool.  I helped dad fix the car. 
[01:57:30]  That's like a fucking Norman Rockwell painting.  It was fantastic.  You had a normal childhood.  I didn't need love.  You're my favorite.  Now I feel bad.  I got a stomachache.  So, Jennifer, what do you got?  Well, listen, the reason why I called is you guys were talking about Ryan Seacrest, and he  is a complete pussy, because he interviewed Brad and Angelina at the Oscars, and they totally  snubbed him.  And he was, like, trying to run after them.  Right.  So he decides to donate $200,000 to their charity to possibly get them to talk to Ryan Seacrest 
[01:58:00]  at the Academy Awards.  Wow.  He has no balls whatsoever.  No, but I mean, like Jan said, he's in that world.  Yeah.  He makes a fucking gazillion dollars being a nice guy.  I guess we could try to be nice guys, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe that wouldn't work.  Hold on, Jennifer.  Matt in Connecticut has something.  Matt, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got it.  I don't know what it is, but this group is just a total con. 
[01:58:30]  Who laughs at dad dying stories?  Goddamn dad dying stories.  Yeah, I was trying to go for a little shock there.  There's Jennifer just laughing and laughing.  Comes with a name.  I'm sorry.  It's all right, Jennifer.  You've got a good sense of humor.  I guess.  All right, we'll see you next time, Jennifer.  Thank you.  Hey, wait a minute.  I have one question.  Yeah.  Listen, my brother's in Botswana in the Peace Corps.  Yeah.  He's coming back in May.  Can we come see your show?  No. 
[01:59:00]  Not allowed.  Bye.  Peace Corps, you goddamn hippie.  Tommy.  What do you got in?  Well, I guess when I was conveying the story of me running into the room to be with dad  while my brother and sister was with my mom, my sister texts, aw.  Oh, really?  And then I guess after the, you're my favorite part, she goes, okay, I take that aw back. 
[01:59:30]  Oops.  Oops.  Oh, my God.  Regis has a CD coming out.  I got a CD coming out.  Oh, Jesus.  It's going to be me singing the standards again.  For real?  That's all he sings is crap.  I bet you he goes the other way and does like some kind of like shocking thing where he does a little Metallica and Rolling Stones or something.  I don't know.  It's just a guess.  Exit light.  Enter night.  Take my head.  But we're off to Never Never Land.  Gelman.  Gelman.  Stop it.  Whiskey in a jar row. 
[02:00:00]  Let's say hi to Chris in Houston.  Chris Houston.  Hey.  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Come on.  Hey, when I was about 14, I went and saw Forrest Gump with my dad and he started crying so hard whenever Jenny died that this young couple on a date next to us had to get up and move over.  They were embarrassed.  Yeah.  I made eye contact with a guy on a date and it was just, I still remember the look on his face.  It was just humiliating.  I don't know what cord it touched to my dad, but he was just bawling like a fucking baby. 
[02:00:30]  That's great.  Wow.  Maybe he had AIDS.  Dude, I'll fucking tell you something right now.  I fucked up.  I was crying two days ago.  What?  I was fucking watching Private Ryan.  Oh.  Holy mo-  I can't fucking not cry.  Dude, the end of that movie.  Is brutal.  When the old man turns out to be Private Ryan.  Well, what got me going, yeah, I understand all that, but what got me going was Tom Hanks basically saying, what's the famous line, earn it or something like that? 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Paul, as Tom Hanks is dying because he did everything to save this kid's life, even though it was kind of stupid because you save one soldier and 28 guys die or whatever it was.  Exactly.  But whatever.  But he said, you know, make it a good life.  Make it a good life, make it worth it or something like that.  And I'm like, fuck, here come the tears.  And then the old soldier, now he's old.  He's standing in front of the grave of Tom Hanks' character.  And he's like, he asks his wife, you know, where's I, a good man?  Oh, God.  And it's like, oh, my God, you can't fucking do this. 
[02:01:30]  And then the great kids are there and his kids.  And it's like, oh, my.  How do you not cry?  Horrible.  Well, I tell you, all of that, the old soldier shit, like Band of Brothers at the end of Band of Brothers where they show the real guys, the real soldiers that were there.  And they're not young anymore.  And they're not young anymore.  And they're crying over lost buddies from fucking 50 years ago.  What about that, we were watching it yesterday, the World War II in HD.  World War II in HD.  You know, they tell the stories.  But then there's a few of these guys that are still alive. 
[02:02:00]  And they go to them.  And they're talking about how this one guy, I remember, I mean, he was older than anything.  And he was talking about how he got his guys into this situation.  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, he knew that he had to get them out.  And it wasn't his job to fight.  It was his job to get them out of this situation.  Right, get them out.  Because they were pinned down.  Machine gunners were all over the place.  And he goes, we're going to have to sit here until it gets dark out and leave.  So they just hunkered down.  And one young kid gets up and starts getting up.  And he goes, get down, get down.  The guy poses his head up, boom, killed him.  And he goes, I wish, you know, somehow I could have tackled that kid. 
[02:02:30]  Like, you know that kid is haunting that fucking guy.  Sure.  I mean, Private Ryan was some real stuff.  But, I mean, this is real because it is real.  Yeah, it's real shit.  Dude, by the way, that goddamn World War II in HD, I've been watching that, is amazing.  It's all, like, color.  The difference between your attachment to a situation in black and white film or color film is totally different.  You watch World War II in black and white.  You're so separated from it that you really don't feel like it's real or it was so long ago that they weren't real people. 
[02:03:00]  Right, of course.  Like, you get this weird feeling.  When you see it in color and see those soldiers' faces sitting there just shell-shocked, like, waiting, or Guadalcanal, and they're just, they've been through the mill.  And they got that look on their face and it's in color?  You, all of a sudden, you're going, holy shit, that guy's like.  It just seems a lot realer, right?  That's just a guy.  Can I ask the dumb question?  Yeah.  Do they colorize it? 
[02:03:30]  No, it was color film.  Really?  They found a bunch of color film that's never before seen on TV, or a lot of it hasn't been seen before on TV.  And, yeah, there were color films back then.  Remember when they were trying to, like, colorize all the black and white films?  Like, shit.  That went away, right?  Yeah.  And there was one guy that they're talking about, and he wrote a letter back home, and it's like, yeah, things are getting quiet.  He goes, I think the war will be over soon, and blah, blah, blah.  He's talking about that.  And he goes, well, I got to catch some sleep, you know, I'll write again soon. 
[02:04:00]  And it's like, his parents got that letter at the same time they got a telegram saying that he was dead.  Oof.  And then it didn't even say the circumstance.  So many people were dying that they couldn't even say, well, he charged up a hill and was shot as he saved this guy.  It was just, he died.  No ifs, ands, or buts, or why, or how, or nothing.  Listen, you've just got to deal with not even knowing where, how, who.  He just either, you know, was in a car accident, driving in a Jeep, or he saved 20 guys and was gunned down. 
[02:04:30]  God bless their military and their families.  I just don't know how you deal with that.  By the way, someone said the knife scene in Private Ryan.  That didn't make me cry.  No, that was fucking just creepy.  Frightening.  That didn't make me cry.  The Tom Hanks death scene, and then like Ant was saying, at the grave as an old guy, he's just brutal.  I mean, there's other times in that movie, you're like, oh, fuck.  And the end of Band of Brothers, where he gives the speech about, oh, you've got to see that whole fucking thing. 
[02:05:00]  Where the actual, one of the actual guys, you know, obviously old, is talking about, you know, how, he goes,  my grandson asked me if I was a hero in the war, and I said no, but I served in the company of them.  Wow.  And he was all emotional and choked up.  Dude, you just gave me chills.  Dude, it's fucking crazy.  You just gave me chills with that.  You think, well, if I wasn't wearing long sleeves, you see mine.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Look at Anthony.  I get all fucking emotional with that shit.  Look at Anthony opening up with his emotions. 
[02:05:30]  Get Lydia on the phone.  We have a breakthrough today.  A break.  There's been a breakthrough.  And they had the advertising, I think it was on Before Curb or After Curb for Pacific?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  That looks good.  Pacific's coming on.  That's Hanks and what?  Spielberg?  Yeah, it's the same Band of Brothers people.  Same people that did Band of Brothers.  Coming out of March?  Coming out of March.  Doing the Pacific Theater.  And the head guy in there, one of the main characters, is the little kid from Jurassic  Park.  The little boy.  Oh, really?  All grown up.  Yeah.  I hate when they grow up. 
[02:06:00]  Ah.  Or Uncle Paul.  I cry like a bitch at the end of The Bucket List.  I didn't see The Bucket List.  The Bucket List.  I would fucking go.  I would watch it.  I got a story about my dad comforting my mom at a funeral.  You know, I'll tell you something about my parents.  You know, when the older relatives start dying off, you go to those wakes.  My parents were the cool ones in the back of the room making jokes and having fun.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to do that.  And they had a nice group around them that kind of lightened the mode.  They weren't the over-the-top relative bringing everyone down to a level that you don't want 
[02:06:30]  to be at.  Yeah.  When my grandfather died, my mother's father, that was a while ago.  And my mother, obviously younger at the time, she goes to the funeral.  I'm at the funeral.  And when the priest says, you know, the ashes, the ashes, shit, and you throw the fucking  rose in there, my mother just goes like, like, like, starts like crying a little bit.  And I am Mr. Uncomfortable in that situation.  So I felt like I had to do something.  So I just kind of put my arm on her, my hand on her shoulder and very standoffish, awkward. 
[02:07:00]  Anthony doesn't know what to do.  Right.  And then recently, uh, her mother just passed away recently.  And it's just like, all right, when we get the fuck out of here to go eat, yeah, we'll  go back to the house.  We'll grab something to fucking eat and, uh, whatever.  Oh, look at this.  When this asshole died.  As we're walking past, you know, tombstones, totally different.  As they get older, they just like, something happens.  It's nice to know that your death means the whole family gets together at a, uh, an inexpensive 
[02:07:30]  restaurant and get some kind of deal on a nice lunch for everybody.  We did, we did it over, uh, my aunt and uncle's house.  Just, you know, the hero sandwiches, the macaroni and shit like that.  Yeah, your life is worth a six foot hero in someone's backyard.  That's it.  That's comforting.  Eh, whatever.  That's it.  You're in the ground.  I'm hungry.  And by Monday, they're back at work.  Jesus.  Life is really fucked up.  A river dergy.  Speaking of movies, my dad, uh, got to go back slightly.  My dad, most embarrassing moment.  He brought us all to see Jaws. 
[02:08:00]  I don't know how he pulled that one off because, uh, that was an R-rated movie, right?  Crying with that little Kittner boy, uh.  No, no, that's a good one.  This isn't a crying one.  Was it?  It was an R-rated movie, right?  You couldn't be.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And we were, when did that movie come out?  I was, I was.  75.  I was at nothing.  76.  You're allowed to go, as long as you're with a guardian.  Was that how it worked?  And, uh, my dad had a big, did I tell the story on the air?  If I did, I apologize.  And we tell the same stories over and over again.  Sharkin.  I fill up fucking five hours every day.  Yeah, give us a break.  Actually, four and a half.  Wink, wink. 
[02:08:30]  Sometimes it's a clip show without clips.  Right.  Just coming out of our mouths.  Right.  Uh, Jaws.  So he's got the big popcorn.  It's me and, uh, I believe it's the.  Did he put a hole in the bottom of the end?  Brother Elmo and Scott from the Hornets, uh, uh, uh, nest video.  No, he did not.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's sick.  I was hoping you didn't catch that.  Although my dad had a big piece.  All right.  Which I inherited, but, uh.  Nice.  I'm not bragging.  Uh, so the, the scene with Jaws.  So he's got the big popcorn. 
[02:09:00]  We're sitting next to him.  And he, he, he looks down to get some popcorn.  He, he pops up just to see Jaws pop out of the water.  The Roy Scheider scene, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  When he's putting the chum over the side.  Fucking sees that.  Wasn't expecting it.  And I swear to you, threw the popcorn everywhere.  It was a full theater.  It went everywhere.  And then everyone starts laughing.  Was that all laughing?  Oh, yeah.  Just laughing at my dad.  It was just one of those things where he, he's looking down, looks up, just in time to see that.  Which even if you were looking at the screen, it was like, yeah, yeah, it made you jump. 
[02:09:30]  That movie, man.  But when, when.  I never forgot that one.  When Ben Gardner's head comes out of the boat, that was like the big shocker moment of that movie.  Before that, you, you didn't have a scene like that in the history of film, I don't think.  No, that was, well, Carrie had that at the end.  At the end of Carrie, when the girl is kneeling graveside and Carrie's hand comes up and grabs her.  Oh, right, right.  And she's just dreaming.  Yeah.  That was fucking frightening. 
[02:10:00]  You want any of these calls?  My grandfather always cried because he survived D-Day.  Yeah, that's just fucking brutal, man.  Because he didn't cry at his own dad's.  My dad cried at my mom's father's funeral because he didn't cry at his own dad's funeral.  Oh, really?  My dad cried when he admitted he was an alcoholic.  I don't talk to him because I'm embarrassed for him.  Wow, Jesus.  My dad cried when he admitted to beating the crap out of some black kid.  Jesus.  Wait a minute, let's go to Dan.  Dan, what do you got, buddy?  What happened? 
[02:10:30]  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Yeah, this happened when I was like 13 years old, towards the end of my parents' relationship.  He came home from the bar one night, trashed, and then he's sitting at the table trying to eat his fucking dinner and he just starts bawling.  And he started telling a story about when he used to work in Queens when he was in his early 20s.  And he said some black kid was throwing rocks at him when he was working on one of the cars.  So he grabbed a pipe from the shop and he snuck around to, I guess, where the kid was, down from the alleyway. 
[02:11:00]  And he piped the kid down and just walked away.  And then years later, he felt guilty because he wasn't sure if he killed the kid or...  Jesus.  I swear to God, man.  And I'm sitting at the table eating my dinner looking at my drunk father crying for the first time I ever seen him cry.  And he's admitting to, you know, a murder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Admitting to what?  Perhaps my...  Maybe a murder.  Jesus.  My father was...  He was a psychopath, though.  I think, to this day, he had some kind of bipolar that he never got medication for. 
[02:11:30]  Dude, he was throwing rocks at him.  Come on.  I know.  He was asking.  He was asking for it.  Yeah.  Well, he used to throw the N-word around like it was nothing.  Jesus.  It was the time.  Yeah.  It was those carefree times.  Yeah, those carefree times.  I remember being out back when I used to live in East Northport as a little kid.  The old picnic table in the backyard.  All the guys.  The women are all inside jibber-jabbering about recipes and bullshit. 
[02:12:00]  The guys are outside drinking shape of beer that you needed the can opener for and stuff like that.  And the N-word flying.  Flying around.  Not always in derogatory term.  Just, you know, using it like, you know, that type of being rich.  You know?  That.  Yeah, there you go.  That is a memory I have.  Danny just found a picture of a Schaefer can. 
[02:12:30]  It was the steel cans with the seam up the side.  Right.  The big interlocking metal seam.  And you needed an opener.  There wasn't a pull tab or anything.  You had to open the top.  And then you're drinking Schaefer.  A lot of guys walking around with those can openers.  All right, boys.  Check it out, right?  I remember that.  Good job, Dan.  That was the first time I ever drank a beer was out of one of those.  My father just gave me one.  And he's like, yeah, because I used to come up and go, can I have a sip of beer?  And he'd be like, yeah, here you go.  And I'd drink a little bit.  And then, you know, they'd laugh at me as I walked away, kind of wobbling. 
[02:13:00]  Wobbling.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Anthony from Long Island says, Jaws was rated PG.  Believe it or not.  Couldn't be.  I want to challenge that.  Really?  David, Kansas City.  What's up?  Pardon, boys.  Hey.  Hey, one good thing about that last scene in Saving Private Ryan.  If you can wipe your tears away enough, you notice his granddaughter's got gigantic tits.  All right.  Get out of here.  You know something?  You are right.  The granddaughter's hot.  I bet you they put that in there just because they knew it was so intense that you get a 
[02:13:30]  little relief from your cry fashion.  You could just stare at her tits and not acknowledge.  Maybe that's why we're all crying.  We want those tits.  I'm bouncing all over the place.  I have literally stared off the screen to the bottom of the screen so as not to cry in front  of like a girl that I'm at the movies with or something like that at certain scenes.  You still there? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, unfortunately, David.  Oh, Jaws was PG.  Thank you, David.  Well.  Could you get a still of Private Ryan?  I want to see the grandkids' boobs.  Granddaughter's titties.  Real big boobs.  Yeah.  Now everyone's talking about when they cried at movies.  We should take a break.  Yeah.  Dude, I want to get the Rob Schneider shit in before Tony Clifton gets here.  Yeah.  Can he at least wait?  Is that all right?  I'd make him wait.  He's scheduled to...  He's here, but...  He's here already?  We have him scheduled for nine, so it shouldn't be a problem.  Have him do like fucking, you know, hey, you're listening to Opie and Anthony stuff. 
[02:14:30]  Well, he's not going to stay for the rest of the show, right?  No.  I don't think so.  All right, so maybe we do Tony Clifton and then Rob Schneider later?  Hope so.  I want to see what this fight is all about.  I want to hear that.  Rob Schneider's...  I saw him once and he was a prick, so...  Yeah, we say no to Rob Schneider every fucking time he comes around.  I know he's Adam Sandler's friend, so that's not smart, but...  Yeah, whatever.  I don't like the guy.  I don't think he's funny.  Whatever.  I don't think he's been in a funny fucking movie. 
[02:15:00]  I mean, people would argue that point, but good for you.  Yeah.  Have you ever laughed at a Rob Schneider film?  Um, a couple of scenes in, um, in, uh, what was that?  Exactly.  That's something with chicks or, uh...  Oh, hot chicks?  Yeah, yeah.  Was it hot chicks?  A couple of scenes in that were funny, but, um, for the most part, no, I haven't.  Have you found the tittied, uh, the tittied granddaughter?  No, I did try going to Mr. Skin, and it was just kind of funny having to type into Mr. Skin, 
[02:15:30]  Saving Private Ryan.  Saving Private Ryan.  I bet nothing really came up.  No, there's nothing there.  No, because she's not even nude.  Yeah.  Yeah, but sometimes they show, like, sexy stuff.  You know what?  Maybe, uh, YouTube, uh, the last, uh, last scene of, of Saving Private Ryan, and then  we can go fast forward a little bit.  She just turned around.  She has nice sweater meat.  Yes.  Remember that one when you're growing up?  Look at her sweater meat.  All right, Ryan, and...  We were all hags growing up. 
[02:16:00]  And, no.  That's Hold the Bridge.  Oh, that's Hold the Bridge, yeah.  Well, yeah, maybe it could.  That shit ain't gonna...  No, no.  That's when it gets to the point.  You know, make it count.  Yeah, that's pretty much right up to where we want to be.  Yeah.  We want the next scene right after.  Final, okay, final scene.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, but it's, it's just him.  No, they, they, they, they pan to the...  Oh, do they?  The family.  I remember that.  They go to the family?  Oh, right.  Okay.  You gotta keep...  Oh, he salutes it. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, my God.  This is terrible.  Why are we subjecting ourselves to this?  This is so fucking bad.  With all the white crosses.  I'm gonna start crying.  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I like how they trick you at the beginning, making you think it's Tom Hanks.  Who the fuck would give this a bad rating, you idiots on YouTube?  You know...  It's, it's, it's four and a half stars.  Dude.  Fucking haters. 
[02:17:00]  What the fuck do you want from your life?  Give me fucking Private Ryan less than five stars.  Where's the big-titted grid?  I'm gonna see ya.  I mean, we get it.  The American flag.  Is that it?  Fast forward.  Yeah, let's fast forward.  I think that was, yeah, I think it goes to the credits.  Huh?  We missed.  We missed it?  Yeah, I think we missed it.  Like, it's, it's when they're walking up to the crosses.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Damn it.  It's where they're walking up.  Oh, man, we don't have it.  End scene.  We gotta see your sweater.  I thought I saw end scene again.  Oh, God.  End, end.  No, that's that.  God damn it.  Uh, Jed in Connecticut.  Jed.  Jed.  No, dude.  Hey, I saw the movie with about eight of my buddies.  At the very end of it, we're all trying not to choke back tears like a bunch of douches. 
[02:18:00]  And walking out of the theater, I'm sitting there going, yeah, you know, the, uh, end of the, you get in the movie, the first scene, that was pretty intense.  Pretty good movie.  Just trying not to look like a complete clown crying in front of everybody.  Hey, fag.  Hey, you don't want to cry.  You never want to cry in front of your, in front of your boys, man.  You're the toughest freaking guys I know, and all of them are trying to choke back tears.  I wish I had known that bitch had big tits.  Yeah.  I would have said it goes.  Well, I think we might have found it now. 
[02:18:30]  Maybe.  Thank you, sir.  Good story.  Oh, no, it's not them walking.  No, I think they pan back to them or something.  Do they?  Oh, oh, she's looking over.  She's looking over as, uh, there's her family.  Oh, oh.  The wife leaves.  The old wife.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Get out of the way, you old bat!  The old wife whose pussy dried up a long time ago.  His life is over.  Was it worth it?  God damn it.  I hope it was worth it.  Ah, that's what we saw.  It can't kind of, she's hiding.  She's got that sweater on.  Well, she has to, it's not about- 
[02:19:00]  My God, it's not about our tits?  No, it's not about our tits.  They don't want-  Got them taped down for Grandpa.  Uh, let's go to-  Oof, I hate saying this name.  Let's go to some girl in Rochester.  Hi, some girl in Rochester.  Rochester.  Hello?  How are you?  I'm good.  My name's Sandy.  How are you guys today?  Oh.  About that.  Am I the only female that's called you guys this morning?  I've been listening to you. 
[02:19:30]  No, no.  Jennifer was on the phone earlier.  Yeah, we enjoyed-  Oh, that's right.  She was nice.  She was laughing at the dead-  Yeah, she was laughing at the dead stories.  Actually, I appreciate that she was laughing, because I was sort of going for that sick laugh.  What do you got?  Well, I was laughing right along with it.  I just want to tell you guys, I have a story.  My father was a World War II veteran.  In fact, he was in the 82nd Airborne, so he was in all these big, you know, these big invasions,  and never really talked about the war much.  And we used to watch these old movies like 12 O'Clock High and Combat. 
[02:20:00]  I don't know if you guys remember them.  Combat.  War movies?  Yes.  And I remember, I was a little kid, and I looked back at him, and, you know, he was all tearful and choked up.  And I might have been five or six, so I went over to stand by him, and he's in his recliner.  And, you know, the old guys, they're all real prim and proper.  You would never do anything inappropriate in front of the kids.  And he farted in his chair while he was crying.  And I'm trying to console him, and he was so upset that I heard, he was upset that I was watching him cry. 
[02:20:30]  He was upset that I heard him fart in his chair.  So he's yelling at me, trying to make the same noise.  He goes, that was the chair.  And he's, like, trying to wiggle around and make the chair make this weird noise.  And I had no idea what he was talking about.  And, you know, he actually made me leave the room because I heard him fart.  Not because I watched him cry, because I heard him fart.  Oh, that's funny.  That's my little story.  Very good.  He farts when he cries.  I was totally distracted by, Danny found a picture of that chick.  Yeah.  She apparently posed in Maxim. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, she's got a nice set.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck the crying old dude.  Oh, my God.  God damn, is that chick hot.  Now we know why he was crying.  Why am I related to her?  Oh, look at those.  Wow.  Oh.  Thank you, Rochester.  Okay, have a good one.  All right.  And you're a fan?  Big fan.  Oh, I appreciate that.  Big fan.  I listen to you guys every morning, so keep it coming, okay?  Oh, yes.  Keep it coming.  What do you like about the show? 
[02:21:30]  What do I like about the show?  Yes.  She doesn't listen enough.  That means you're not a big fan.  Not a big fan.  Why is she holding oranges?  I don't care.  What does that mean?  I don't even care.  Holy shit.  Wow.  How do I...  Danny, how do they find these pictures?  They've got to see these pictures.  This is the granddaughter from Saving Private Ryan.  Her name is kind of weird, so you're going to have to...  She's obviously a model.  She was in Maxim, and she's...  All right, man. 
[02:22:00]  Her name is Nina.  Uh-huh.  Uh, Muschalik.  That's M-U-S-C-H-A-L-L-I-K.  All right, so M-U-S-C-H-A-L-L-I-K.  Yeah.  Nina Muschalik.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  That's hot.  Why don't we break...  Phones are lit.  Yes.  Fucking lit.  Bunch of weepy motherfuckers out there.  I'd love to continue with this, but we've got to get Tony Clifton here.  He's a big star, man.  Big star.  He's a big star. 
[02:22:30]  Let's go backstage.  Sam went backstage with Greedy E-Rock.  Greedy E-Rock.  Greedy E-Rock eats too much, and Sam wanted to get to the bottom of it.  Speaking of eating, I'm going to be delving into my...  Wait, what are you eating?  It looks like face yogurt, but it's F-A-G-E.  Is it like Activia?  It's all natural.  This is where I throw myself under the bus.  Oh, no.  How's it spelled? 
[02:23:00]  F-A-G-E.  So you're eating faggy yogurt?  You have faggy yogurt.  Wow, I didn't even fucking pick up on that, because I thought this part would throw me  under the bus.  What is that?  It's a dual container.  Well, you got the goodness over here, then you mix in with the shittiness over here.  It's all natural.  Ready for this?  It is called faggy yogurt.  Faggy yogurt.  It's all natural Greek stained.  Oh, strained.  Greek strained yogurt.  Greek stained is different. 
[02:23:30]  There's a diagram here.  Yeah, the yummy and not as yummy.  You mix the yummy with the not as yummy.  Why don't we go backstage with Sam here.  Tony Clifton next.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and it was special breakfast day recently at the O.B. and Anthony  show when some O&A fans came to visit the studio and brought the staff breakfast from McDonald's. 
[02:24:00]  Upon seeing the food, E-Rock decided to live up to expectations and overindulge.  Instead of working for the show, E-Rock spent the rest of the morning on the toilet where  we knew we had to get the story.  Hey, E-Rock.  I was just looking for you.  Where were you?  With Rob Cross.  No, no, no.  Before that.  Oh, I was in the bathroom?  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, uh, McDonald's didn't sit too well.  What did you eat?  Um, I had one of the chicken biscuits that you love so much. 
[02:24:30]  And?  And, um, a few hash browns.  How many is a few?  I think four.  And what else?  And I made it through a bite of a sausage egg McMuffin.  And then what happened?  Um, did little boy's tummy catch up with him?  After a little while, yes.  You see what happens to greedy boys?  So, um, I guess I, um, it didn't sit too well.  So after a little while, I felt the gurgling.  And then I, uh, ran to the bathroom. 
[02:25:00]  Did you, uh, empty your bowels?  Oh, did I?  Do you want a fifth hash brown?  No, I can't do it.  I know.  I really feel like shit.  As E-Rock ran back to the toilet to get rid of the rest of his sausage McMuffin,  we went to the O&A staff and to the listeners who brought in the breakfast to get their opinions.  Hey, Mark, did you hear about Eric's problem?  No, I did not.  I don't know if this falls under engineering or not, but Eric ate a chicken biscuit, a sausage McMuffin, and four hash browns. 
[02:25:30]  And now he's got the shits.  That would be under plumbing.  Okay.  Troy.  No.  We, uh, we had a McDonald's breakfast delivered to us today by some listeners.  Yes.  Eric had a bit much, and now he's spending most of the show on the toilet.  Yeah.  To be honest with you, I'm slightly jealous, because I'm a little backed up this morning.  Well, maybe you should do what Eric did and have a chicken biscuit, a sausage McMuffin, four hash browns, and a Diet Coke.  Wow.  Do you think after such a big breakfast, Eric is going to skip lunch? 
[02:26:00]  I would guess no.  Yeah.  All right.  Jeff, Kasha, Chris, and Liz, you guys are from Chicago and came to visit, and you brought us McDonald's this morning.  Yes, we did.  It was, uh, was it good?  I enjoyed it.  I don't know if you guys know this or not, but E-Rock enjoyed it a little too much, and he's now attached to the toilet bowl.  I figured as much would happen to him.  Yes.  Now, you guys, this is the first time you're seeing the show live.  Uh, after the descriptions of E-Rock on the air, uh, could you tell who he was as soon as you looked at him? 
[02:26:30]  Almost immediately.  Do you think that Eric could stand to lose a few pounds?  A few or 50.  Wow.  How humiliating.  Well, E-Rock, as long as you're enjoying yourself, I suppose it's okay to be a greedy boy.  But one day you'll realize the four hash browns is probably a bit much.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with O&A. 
[02:27:00]  All right, well, we're back.  Um, oh, a little Pop-Tart mouth.  Yeah, I was ready to pass out.  It's got Pop-Tart mouth.  Sorry about that.  That delicious yogurt didn't fill me up.  No, huh?  Someone's saying it's called Faye.  Faggy.  But it's spelled Faggy.  F-A-G-G-Y.  F-A-G-G-Y.  F-A-G-G-Y.  F-A-G-Y-O-G-Y.  It can't be good, man, for you.  It tasted like whipped cream.  That's not good. 
[02:27:30]  I don't think your yogurt's supposed to taste like whipped cream.  I'm a little scared by that.  Why don't you just have Activia?  Trying to keep the calories down.  Huh?  Why don't you have Activia?  I can't after what you said about it.  I can't eat the shit yogurt.  Push the shit out.  Um.  Are they getting Tony Clifton?  Tony Clifton.  Yeah, he should be making his way down the hall.  Is there anything better than brown sugar Pop-Tarts?  I asked that question today.  Uh.

Well, I'm not a fan.  They're softer.  I'm not a fan of the Frosted Pop-Tarts.  Non-frosting.  Look.  You don't have to put the frosting on.  No.  You do that, like, separate.  With toaster's stool.  With your cock.  With your cock.  I guess they're not bringing them down.  They are.  Didn't we say, bring them on when we go on the air?

She's always drunk, so I always keep her loaded.  God damn.  Yeah, what is she on, man?  That's not fucking alcohol.  That's cool.  It was in late night.  I hear you.  Why was it late night?  What were you doing?  I was, um... 
[02:30:30]  Were you licking the little girls again?  No.  How were you licking the little girls again?  No, she liked it.  I'm trying to get her to stop that.  Yeah?  It's like a dick dick.  I was not.  I was fighting with boys.  I was fighting with military boys.  Oh, really?  Why were you fighting with military boys?  Because they're just obnoxious and they need to be...  Were they trying to, uh...  Were they trying to, uh...  You know, maybe bed you down or something?  She's no whore.  Hey, what's the difference between a whore and a bitch?  What?  A whore will screw anybody in the room. 
[02:31:00]  Everybody in the room.  A bitch will screw everybody in the room but you.  Ah.  Very good.  Yeah?  Very good.  So what are you?  Me neither.  Karen?  That's my dog.  This is for real.  I'm just adopted her.  She's fucking cute.  We're going to go to Disneyland, right?  We're talking about it?  Yeah.  Daddy's going to bring me to Disneyland.  We're taking it to Disneyland.  I've never been.  She's never been there.  No?  I didn't know we had the real-life Uncle Paul in the studio.  This is pretty good.  Tony Clifton, where are you performing?  Well, I was just over at that Santos party house.  Yeah? 
[02:31:30]  What's that?  You ever go over there?  I was in Soho.  We did that, what, Monday night?  Yeah.  We did that Monday night and a great show.  Everyone went crazy.  We drank...  How much did we drink that night?  Oh, like a fifth and a half.  Oh, man.  Between me and you.  We had a big bottle of a fifth of Gentleman's Jack.  Wow.  And I got on stage and I said, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not getting off the stage, so that bottle  is empty, right?  And then the bartender filled it back up.  Well, we weren't looking.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, so we got really screwed up, man.  Can you swear on the show or what?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can say anything? 
[02:32:00]  You can say cunt.  I can?  Yeah, anything you want.  Really?  The audience enjoys that word a lot.  I like her smoky voice.  Yeah.  She got that partied out, partying all night voice.  Partied out really, man.  She's a good one.  Is that hot?  She's a good one.  Yeah, well, look at Trixie.  Look at that, huh?  Well, that's just, huh?  Hey, Trixie.  Hey, Trixie.  Yeah, Trixie's got nice bosoms.  Yeah, a lot of cleavage showing that.  Hey, Trixie, Trixie, let me ask you.  Do you smoke after sex?  I don't know, because I never look down.  That's Trixie. 
[02:32:30]  That's timing.  I like that is timing.  It's all about the timing.  That's right.  That's good.  Why do women get yeast infections?  Why, Tony?  So they know how it feels to live with an irritating cunt.  Be more funny.  How do you get a gay guy to make love to a woman?  How would you do that?  You put shit in her pussy.  All right.  You know what?  There you go.  That's all right.  Hey, what sound does a baby make when you put it in a microwave? 
[02:33:00]  What?  I don't know.  I was jerking off.  Hey, what's 80-year-old pussy taste like?  What?  Depends.  Oh, yeah.  Tony, you're supposed to be this big partier, and you're drinking a fucking Pepsi.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, no, man.  We got really fucked up.  Oh, fuck.  No, I was vomiting all the fucking night.  Right, baby?  Yeah.  And then you were sick like a dog?  No.  You were sick like a dog.  Do you have separate rooms or stuff, or is he going to share a big bed together? 
[02:33:30]  Oh, yeah, the same bed.  Yeah, well, that's what you were doing here, doctor girl.  I understand.  We keep it clean.  We keep it clean.  I understand.  I understand.  Every once in a while, Mickey Finn.  Knock her out.  Mickey Finn.  Yeah, I like that.  Old school.  Old school.  Fuck the roofies.  Fuck the roofies.  It's a slip you up Mickey Finn here.  She's got nice stems.  Nice set of stems on her.  Hey, speaking of stems, what do you call a Mexican chick with short legs?  What?  Cunts way low.  Jesus, Tony. 
[02:34:00]  It's all gold.  It's all gold.  Hell, hey, you know, a guy comes home to a trailer park, his wife, and she's packing.  And he says, honey, what are you doing?  She says, I'm leaving you.  You're leaving me?  Why are you leaving?  Because you're a pedophile.  He says, pedophile?  That's a pretty big word for a 14-year-old.  Okay.  Come on.  Where's the drum machine around?  Oh, I wish.  I didn't know we needed our drum today.  Wow.  These girls are beautiful, but I'm telling you, they're a part, for real, part of Tony Clifton 
[02:34:30]  and Katrina Kiss My Ass Orchestra.  What do they do?  Yeah, what do they do?  For the show.  And did she sing?  Can we see some dancing?  Did you sing and dance?  Let's do a little dance.  Do here.  Go on.  Get up.  Do a little dance.  Quick, quick, quick, quick.  Oh, it's all right.  We don't even know she's in a radio station.  Quick, quick.  Oh, wow.  She's doing a little chair dancing.  Let's do it.  Let's watch show.  Shake it a little.  Watch this stuff.  Yeah.  Come on.  You can do it.  Wow.  She...  Wow.  There we go.  Right?  Wow.  Damn.  Nice.  It's so strange without music.  And you're just... 
[02:35:00]  And your daughter's just laughing.  You obviously have good blowjobs.  That's right.  Yeah.  Now, I'll pour the act for her talent.  What?  Interpretive movement?  That's good.  Yeah.  Wow.  Why is the black man couldn't make love all night?  Why is that?  Well, because if you don't have to work the next day, you'll go.  Oh, yeah.  We get everybody out, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, what did the Jewish pedophile say?  What? 
[02:35:30]  Hey, little girl, you want to buy some candy?  I could do the Jew jokes because I had a relative who died at the...  The home source thing?  Yeah.  No, died at the home source.  Oh, really?  He fell off the guard tower.  Jesus, Tony.  You're going to get people outraged.  Guys, did I do this show once before?  Yeah.  It's Bob Zemuda.  That's not me.  That's the Buddha guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's doing that.  Then he's going around riding my coattails.  Yeah, he is.  Like that fucking Kaufman did.  Oh.  You know, they had me host a thing at Caroline's. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Was it two weeks ago?  Yeah.  Two weeks ago over at Caroline's, this Andy Kaufman's 5th Anniversary Comedy Award.  Mm-hmm.  They asked me to emcee it.  The brother calls me.  Kaufman's brother, Michael.  Good old Michael.  Yeah.  Do you ever meet him?  Yeah.  I would like to meet Michael Kaufman.  Yeah, he's strange.  Stranger than his brother.  Andy thought he was strange.  Wow.  So you can imagine how fucking strange this guy is.  Yeah.  You know, and he said, come emcee.  I said, are you serious?  And I had to sit there.  Oh, my God.  They kicked me out.  Really?  Yeah, finally, they had the terrible acts going on.  Finally, the third act, some fucking mime. 
[02:36:30]  I thought I was going to kill myself.  So that was it.  And I said, let's say I had Trixie there.  No, you had Mastare.  No, I had Madame Mastare.  Oh, Madame Mastare.  She went back.  I had Madame Mastare.  I said, hey, instead of this fucking stupid-ass comedy shit, let's get some fucking tits and  ass up on stage.  They didn't like that.  So I was bodily removed.  You're making a good point, though.  Tits and ass, much better than shitty comedy.  Tony, your wig is horrendous.  What?  What's that wig?  What are you talking about?  It's horrendous.  That looks good. 
[02:37:00]  Looks like Pacino.  Sure.  Does Pacino have one?  Is it the wig?  It looks like it.  That reminds me.  You hear about the Polack who bought his wife a wig?  No.  Yeah, he heard she was getting bald in the office.  He's got something for everything.  He sure does.  I feel like it.  Just like that, on the tip of their fingers.  Yes.  But this is, look at this piece of ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm fine.  We're going to find the right husband for you, right?  No, I don't want a husband.  Yes.  Why not?  Why not?  Why don't you want a husband?  I'm happy.  Huh?  I'm happy already.  Yeah?  Come on.  Those are the pills.  You want real happiness. 
[02:37:30]  You're going to be living with me, aren't you?  In two more years, she's out.  Really?  Her newly adopted daughter.  When she turns 18?  How old a gal are you?  About 18.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's 18.  She's 18.  Don't worry about it.  Don't even worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Hey, what do blacks get for Christmas?  What?  What a little black boy gets for Christmas.  What?  Your bike.  See, because...  He's killing me.  Hey, why is aspirin white? 
[02:38:00]  Uh, why?  Because it works.  Ah!  Oh, I heard one yesterday.  Another one for our good black friends out there.  That is...  What's the difference between a pizza and a black man?  Pizza and a black man?  Yeah.  This is a good one.  I'm surprised that doesn't know these.  I don't know this one.  The difference between a pizza and a black man, you know?  No.  The difference between a pizza and a black man is that a pizza can serve, can feed a family  of four.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:38:30]  I think I have heard that one.  Yeah, there you go.  I believe...  You've got to jump on them then quick.  Oh, hey!  We did take that man to your life.  Why did...  Why did...  Why did...  What?  Uh, nothing.  What?  What does she babble about?  What does she babble about?  I found her photography online, so I'm just...  She's like, oh my God, that's me.  ...gawking at her tits and ass.  Is she amazing?  Oh, but she's beautiful.  Those are all natural, so please enjoy them while they're up, because I'm not sure how  long that's going to last.  You can tell they look very natural.  Those are natural.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  And in the show, man, she takes these down and shakes them.  Oh, shit.  Actually, I do Pilates, so there's a little bit...  I guess that's cheating.  I'm not sure...  Well, right now, you should do some pull-outies, if you know what I mean.  Hey, Tony, can she do some pull-outies for us?  Huh?  No, it's me.  No, it's me.  No, it's me.  No, it's me.  It's me.  I've got to talk about it.  I try.  I try.  You've got any tassels here?  Let's do some tassels.  Yeah, put them on.  There's a big radio show.  Turn around there in the corner, because you can do that.  They just don't put them on.  They don't just like...  This is a big radio show.  I'll hold them on for you.  Here, I'll show you guys. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Hold them on.  You need to lick them on.  Ah!  You carry tassels with you?  You never know when you have an emergency burlesque.  Yeah.  Hey, what about you?  Are you going to keep the clothes on?  I'm an actress.  You're an actress?  Really?  I'm a singer.  I thought I'm going to make you a star.  You know what I mean?  What do you sing?  Oh, big, big star.  What kind of music are you singing?  Just Felder.  Oh, yeah.  I mean...  Do a little rap.  Come on, quick.  Yeah, what do you got?  Come on.  This is your good chance. 
[02:40:00]  Work quick.  On the top of your head, man.  You've got to be on soap business.  You've got to be on that all the time.  I can't make up my mind.  Wait for the sun to shine.  All I see is the rain, and all I'm feeling is pain.  Maybe I'm just wasting time.  Oh!  What happened?  That's it.  You don't see anything.  That's not going to help their self-esteem.  That's what you get.  What'd you do, Opie?  What happened to that?  What, what, what?  You said, we don't see any titties now.  Hey, what's the difference?  What are you talking about?  What's the difference between my...  If we don't see titties, that guy in the corner is taking you out. 
[02:40:30]  Taking you out quick.  Show the whole thing, man.  Hey, what's the difference between my girlfriend and a dead baby?  A what?  I don't kiss my girlfriend after sex.  Oh, see, that's just shocking.  Now you're just going for shock.  You think so?  Yeah, yeah.  I like the other ones.  And the timing's a little weird.  A little more humor.  Okay, yeah, let's get more pictures.  I don't hear about the Polack whose wife had triplets.  No.  You went out looking for the two other guys.  I think in that triplets, she's got to fuck two other ones because... 
[02:41:00]  What happened?  Because she's stupid because she's a Polack.  Oh.  What?  Which was it?  She thought two other guys were needed for the two other babies.  Or he did.  He did.  He did.  Because he's Polack.  That's good.  How about the Polack who's...  How about the Polish firing squad?  How does that work?  He's standing in a circle.  Polish parachute.  Opens on impact.  That's crazy.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Who's that?  Is that him?  Is that Triggs?  When we've seen the tassels on the boobs. 
[02:41:30]  Here's one on a boob.  Why can't you perform for us?  Tony, come on.  If you want to see it, come to the show.  It's fabulous.  Yeah, well, come to the show.  If you lay those out, we can then go, wow, you better come to the show.  I'll wear them if you guys wear them.  If you twirl tassels, I will.  Why do you have to wear them?  Let's get you right to wear them.  Because I wear tassels.  I see all your beautiful naturalness.  Tony, you can't get this done.  Well, I mean, it takes your time to put that on.  What do you have to do?  You don't need tassels. 
[02:42:00]  They don't stick.  They don't stick.  You don't need fucking tassels in this environment.  How am I supposed to twirl them?  No, she won't show them.  Only in the show do you see their exposed stuff.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Sit.  And these girls are not?  Tors.  Strippers.  Well, we were all.  Stripperless stars.  Very different.  Very different, right?  Very much so.  Very much so.  Trust me, right?  Yeah, I got it.  Right.  Yeah, they get very offended if you're just thinking, well, you got a Dennis Hoff girl coming in  and shows her fucking titties, shows her fucking pussy.  There's nothing wrong with that, right? 
[02:42:30]  I'm a horse friend of mine.  I don't know.  We are men.  We like to see pussy.  That's right.  That's true.  Pussy good.  Pussy good.  Pussy good.  Cock teasing, real bad.  Real bad.  Blue balls, not as good.  Not good.  Nope.  So they do like a burlesque thing.  That's good.  Yeah, it's a big troupe.  We got a big troupe.  We got a big Katrina Kiss My Ass orchestra, a 15-piece orchestra, a five-piece horn section.  Come see the show, man.  They look like they stepped out of an Ed Wood movie. 
[02:43:00]  Don't they?  Yes.  That's good.  You don't know who Ed Wood is.  No.  You know what Wood is.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, they do.  And the set kind of moves around a little bit.  How pretty, perfect.  Yeah.  Where are you playing, Tony?  Well, now we're going into the studio, and I'm cutting my first album for a CD, going back to Clifton Mirror, right? 
[02:43:30]  You know, Clifton Mirror is where we all live.  We all live together.  You all live together?  The Cliftonettes live with me.  We all live together in Clifton Mirror up in South Lake Tahoe, and we've got a studio there, and we're recording, and this is very exciting.  We're going in for about a month and a half now.  We have many different big names.  I'm going to do a duet album like Frank.  Oh, like Frank did.  That's right.  He brought in all kinds of celebrities.  I'll give you a scoop.  I'll give you a scoop.  Guess who just signed in that I'm going to be singing with?  Who?  R.E.M.  No way.  No way, man.  Really?  It's a done deal.  Done deal.  Well, they obviously were very big fans. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, well, we're going to do Man on the Moon together.  Yeah?  Yeah, you know, the Man on the Moon, because that was one of those days.  It was about Andy Kaufman.  I understand that.  Yeah.  Huh?  How's Andy doing?  Is he still alive?  Well, you know, please, man, I'll tell you.  You know, I go on stage, people say, Andy, like I'm still fucking Andy Kaufman or something,  you know.  I say, oh, you coming to see Andy?  They go, yeah, you want to see Andy?  I say, get yourself a flashlight and a shovel.  Oh, shit.  I swear, I was doing an interview the other day, and a guy says to me, he says, if Andy  Kaufman was alive today, what would he be doing? 
[02:44:30]  And I said, scratching on the inside of his casket.  Oh, yeah, trying to get the fuck out of there.  That's fucking happening.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's been 25 years.  Yes, it has.  He was supposed to come back, right?  I don't know.  What's John Lennon doing now?  Blowing Andy Kaufman in the hereafter.  I don't know.  What do you mean?  Decomposing.  Oh, I like that.  See, because he was a composer.  Write that one down.  I like that.  I'm going to write that down.  That's a strong one.  That's a strong one.  Here's a pen.  Write it down.  I like that.  Write it down.  Take that with you.  He's writing it down. 
[02:45:00]  He likes that one.  I will.  I will.  Fuck him, man.  I need it.  Yeah, take it.  I'm honored.  I'm fucking honored.  We'll help this act of yours.  Hell, yes.  There was a few more minutes.  I like it.  Right?  I like you brought in a couple of, you brought in some eye candy.  That's right.  A lot of guys don't do that.  They come in, they just want to fucking do that.  I love.  Eye candy.  Always.  That's the trick.  I like it.  Then I got a fragrance come out.  This is for true, right?  It is true.  This is true.  They're doing a Tony Clifton fragrance that's going to be in Target stores.  Target.  Yeah, $1.98.  Everybody can afford it.  $1.98 for the fragrance. 
[02:45:30]  $1.98.  I'm serious.  And what is it based on?  I like a lot of this.  Who is the guy's name?  Yuli?  Oh, I don't know.  Yuli.  Wait, we got his name here.  Yuli Lang.  And this is the guy that did all the top fragrances for all the big up perfume coming.  Yeah, this is for real.  Give it a French name.  Pepe Le Pew.  What is the name?  You got a name for it?  Yeah, it's called Clifton.  That's it.  This is for real.  But they had to get my scent.  It's for real.  It's right.  And they had to get my scent, so they put some, they got like Jack Daniels, and they 
[02:46:00]  got like cigarette butts, you know?  It smells like me.  And it gets stronger as the night goes on.  That sounds...  Yeah, I'm telling you.  We're going to send you some.  That sounds like a great little...  That sounds like something people might want to dab behind their ears.  I'm just saying.  It smells good.  It smells good.  It smells good?  It will double do the cocktail.  Yeah.  Well, lean over and talk into Mike.  We can't hear you.  No, don't move the mic on.  This is radio.  See, that's why she's a blonde.  You know what I mean?  Just grab the back of her head and put her deal at Mike.  I'll tell you.  You have to.  It is radio.  I'm not speculating or saying anything.  I don't steal it.  Just put it in the center here.  You could save this segment by showing your boobs. 
[02:46:30]  I know.  We could.  It's going to be so much better when I do.  Where did you find these girls?  Yeah, Tony.  Everybody's from New Orleans, because this was all part of the Katrina Kiss My Ass Orchestra.  Yeah.  Everybody from New Orleans is in the band.  So you're saying anybody that was affected by Katrina can kiss my ass?  Pretty much so.  That's right.  Yeah.  I thought of it that way, Mike.  I do.  Write it down, Tony.  Write it down.  I thought that was it.  Oh, it's in support.  It's like the hurricane can kiss your ass. 
[02:47:00]  I got it.  How do you know when the Japs move into your neighborhood?  How?  All the Mexicans get car insurance.  Okay.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  That might be a West Coast joke.  Let me think.  It's probably a West Coast joke.  Well, here should be Puerto Ricans.  Puerto Ricans.  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Puerto Ricans.  Yeah.  We did that show.  Where was that?  Soho, right?  Yeah.  And man, that was all China.  That's in Chinatown, right?  Close to Chinatown.  Sort of.  Tell him about the guy.  About the Chinese.  The elevator guy.  Oh, there's hitting the phone for money.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  He has his ups and downs.  Oh. 
[02:47:30]  Write it down, Tony.  Write it down.  He has his ups and downs.  I got my standard.  That one doesn't go down, my friend.  Thank you, though.  I didn't see him going for the pen on that one.  Hey, what time does the Chinaman go to the dentist?  Oh.  Kenny, you want to answer that one?  What time does the Chinaman go to the dentist, Kenny?  Kenny, you know this.  We're going to do it.  2.30.  Oh.  Kenny.  Goddamn.  An impeccable timing.  Very good.  And he got up out of the chair.  And he got the pronunciation right. 
[02:48:00]  That's right.  Because if you just go 2.30, people go, what?  What you got?  You got to go 2.30.  Hold on.  I got it.  Chinese.  Kenny can run circles around you with one-liners.  I see him writing this down now, right?  No.  Kenny, you want to give him another one of your fine one-liners?  Let's see if Tony Clifton is on the same level as you.  Here we go.  Clifton or Kenny?  Okay.  Go for it.  Tony.  Yes, sir.  What's the beauty about fucking a five-year-old in the shower?  Because when you slick their hair back, it looks like a little boy. 
[02:48:30]  Bump!  Bump!  Was that really the answer?  Hey, here's one.  Hey, here's one.  Hey, here's one.  Hey, here we go.  This is good.  All right.  This is good.  What's the best part about fucking 26-year-olds?  What?  There's 20 of them.  Ah!  That's a numbers joke.  Kenny, back to you.  I get it.  Back to you, Kenny.  If I knew I needed a calculator for you, you might have brought one.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What are we?  Henny Youngman today?  What is it? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Kenny, back to you.  Tony.  Yes, sir.  Where are you having lunch today?  Uh, I don't know.  Where?  Between my legs.  What?  Did you make that up?  Yeah.  You're embarrassing.  This guy is the king of the one-liners.  Talk about gays here.  We weren't talking about gays.  Yeah, yeah.  So anyway, these two gay guys, these two gay guys are in bed going at him.  Just then a plane comes out of the sky, crashes in the building, and kills both of them. 
[02:49:30]  Who gets to heaven first?  The guy that was taken in the ass because his shit's already packed.  That's a long way to go.  Well, I did it fast.  Kenny?  I'm not the king of the one-liners.  The virus is the king of the one-liners.  Oh!  You're right.  Good.  Oh, look at the virus.  Hey, hey, here's one for New York.  Why is it Superman did not save the World Trade Center?  Why didn't he?  He was crippled. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, I'm dead.  Oh, he was at the time.  Was he?  Was he dead yet?  I don't know.  No, he was crippled.  I don't know chronologically if that joke is wrong.  Okay, okay.  Forgive me.  I'll take it off the lid.  I'll take it off the fucking lid.  I'll take it off the fucking lid.  And he scratches it off.  Look at her.  Come on, look at her.  Hey, Tony.  Tony and his broads.  Look at that.  Tony and his broads.  Oh.  He's a good fish.  Tony and his broads.  Hold on.  Let me get this on film for everybody so they can see this, okay?  That is stunning. 
[02:50:30]  They're stunning girls.  I'm a broad now.  Yeah, but you should see him on stage.  Broads.  Broads.  Broads.  Broads.  Broads.  Broads.  Broads.  Like that.  Tony and the Broads.  There's something endearing and classical about saying, hey, a couple of broads.  Yeah, yeah.  Broads, yeah.  Not in the old days used to be good.  Broads aren't good.  You don't like that.  Yeah, broads are good.  Frank used that.  Or downs.  You call them downs.  Guys didn't want to go on a place where there were no broads.  That's right.  Or dames.  Yeah, dames.  Yeah, yeah.  I was that, yeah.  Nice stems.  Nice pins.  Just not cunts.  Nice set of pins.  No, you keep the cunts outside.  Fuck yeah, man. 
[02:51:00]  Frank didn't like the cunts.  Oh, no.  Ava Gardner, you know.  He shoved them all on fucking half-blind black guy.  Yeah, Sammy got his leftovers.  Hey, hey, let me remind you of all.  Why is Stevie Wonder, why is it Stevie Wonder can't read?  Why?  Because he's black.  You can't say that, Tony.  I thought it was going to be because he was blind.  I thought you could say anything on this damn thing.  I thought it was going to be because he was blind, and he went the other way with it.  You keep that. 
[02:51:30]  Don't you re-scratch that one.  That one works, Tony.  That one works.  That is good.  How did you get so close with this girl here?  Like, I can understand you pick her up somewhere down there.  I was driving about, what, 80 miles away from Biloxi.  This is true.  And what highway was that?  I-10.  I-10.  She was hitchhiking.  You look a little older, but.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were I-10.  I'm sorry.  That's good.  I'm going to play home right in that one down.  That's good.  Right off the top.  No, I-10. 
[02:52:00]  You've got it.  I-10, she was hitchhiking looking like so damn cute, and she got in the car.  I was driving the Chrysler 300, right?  The Chrysler 300?  Uh-huh.  At the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then we picked her up, and then I said, hey, look, baby.  And then we started talking, and she said she started rapping and stuff.  Wow.  I said, look, I'm going to take you and make you a star, right?  And we've been on the road together how long now?  About a year?  About a year and a half.  Many different shows.  A little over a year and a half.  You didn't think maybe something would go wrong?  Were you hitching that a young girl hitchhiking like that?  Maybe somebody picks you up with a little dangerous? 
[02:52:30]  No.  Look at that.  She cute.  She looks cute, but she, I mean, like, she's-  She'll kick your ass.  She'll kick your ass.  She'll kick your ass.  She'll kick a razor blade in her mouth or something.  Kick that ass.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She's a toughie.  I'm sure there's plenty of fucking girls in shallow graves that said the same thing.  I'll kick their ass.  All right.  I told her, she's sitting on your lap, kick some leaves on top and hope I left no fibers.  She's sitting on your lap right now.  That's all right.  Do you have a heart on?  Oh.  Oh, come on, my daddy.  Yeah.  It's my daddy. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Do you feel his heart on?  Daddy lifts her up by the titties when he picks her up on the lap.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, watch your fucking mouth.  I'm sorry, sir.  I didn't mean this any disrespect.  You got my fucking daughter.  No, I'm not.  Don't joke around.  I'm serious.  I didn't mean any disrespect.  Yeah, because it's all fine, but now you're pushing it.  I'm serious.  No disrespect.  That's what I tell you.  I'll fucking come over that fucking table and fuck off me.  Yeah, you remember when you slapped that guy?  I know, yeah.  George Daly.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Because it's my really new lady.  You know what it is?  I'm sorry.  She's just very attractive.  No fucking cunt.  She's very attractive, so, you know, I just keep looking, but no disrespect. 
[02:53:30]  Okay, good.  No disrespect.  Kenny, you got another one-liner?  You're letting us down today, Kenny.  Every time we drive home, you got a one-liner.  Here comes one.  Hey, Tony.  Yes, sir.  You know what happened when I was at the hotel last night?  No, what?  What happened?  I got a knock on the door by a beautiful woman, and she offered me super sex.  Yep.  So I took the soup.  Write it down, Tony.  Write it down.  Write that one down. 
[02:54:00]  That's good.  You like that one?  Oh, she can write?  She can write?  Not that.  You're pushing it, my friend.  You're pushing it.  I'm teasing it.  Hey, what does a black man do after sex?  Oh, what?  20 years.  All right, you know.  Keep that one in there, Tony.  I thought it was watching the mace out of his eyes.  Oh, that was Mike Tyson.  Yeah, I was going to go for that, but then I kind of picked up.  You're good.  I like that.  Hold on.  We got Sean and George has got a one-liner for Tony. 
[02:54:30]  Tony Clifton.  I don't even know why he's here, because he has nothing to promote, but Sean and Georgia.  Sean.  Hey.  Who's that?  Tony, what's the difference between a gay guy and a fridge?  A gay guy and a refridged.  The difference is this.  The difference is that when you pull the meat out of the refridged, it doesn't fart.  Damn it.  Wow.  Pretty good, huh?  Come on, my friend.  Yeah.  Don't mess with Tony Clifton.  Yeah.  Let's see if Bruce is going. 
[02:55:00]  Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  Bruce, huh?  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Hey, guys, Tony, what's the difference between a Jew and a pizza?  Between what?  A Jew and a pizza.  A Jew and a pizza?  Oh, this is a Jew in the oven joke.  I see it coming.  Oh, it's got to be.  It's got to be.  What is it?  Yeah, yeah.  The pizza don't scream when you put it in the oven.  Oh, come on, man.  That's bad.  That's bad.  That's you, Joe.  That's terrible.  That's, come on.  That's as bad as, like, what's the difference between Santa Claus and a Jew?  What?  Santa Claus comes down the chimney.  Oh, Lee.  Hey, you can't do these. 
[02:55:30]  It ain't right.  We cannot go down this road.  I will not be party to this.  No, no, you should not.  We cannot go down this freight car track.  I will not go down that.  Absolutely not.  Kenny, you got one more?  Come on, Kenny.  Hey, Tony.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  You know why I asked my girlfriend to get her belly button pierced? 
[02:56:00]  This sounds like a good one.  No, why?  This way I have some place to hang the air freshener.  Write it down, Tony.  Write it down.  That's a good one.  Wait a sec, wait a sec, wait a sec.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Wait, you get it?  Her cunt stinks.  Hey, what's the good thing about having sex with a homeless woman?  Oh, wow.  You can drop her off from anywhere.  No. 
[02:56:30]  That's a good answer, though.  Her pussy smells just like her asshole.  Why would that be good, Tony?  Explain.  What?  What?  Another guy there with a follow-up question.  You got me to stump, my friend.  Now, what about these girls as far as grooming goes?  What types of hairstyles, and not the ones we can see, what are you sporting there?  Do you go wood floor, or as we like to call it, too, the JonBenet Ramsey? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Which is just, you know.  The blonde is horrifying to be here at this point.  Oh, you JonBenet Ramsey it?  Oh, sorry.  Guilty.  What about you, dear?  Trixie, what do you do?  I plead the fifth on this one.  I'm just going to let the tease go on.  I'm sorry.  Do you have a little airstrip, or a Hitler mustache, or a big 70s Earth Mama muff?  You got to buy me dinner first before we can get there.  I like it to look like a pool table rack and fill it with fucking Afro hair.  That's what I like to look at that.  Like a merkin?  Big fucking, I want the hair, I want the corners of her pubes to reach her ass on. 
[02:57:30]  That's impressive.  Yeah.  Who rocks that?  I want it to look like she's wearing a bikini.  His mom from the 50s.  Oh, no.  You know what those little, you know what those, around a woman's nipple.  You can make a mom joke fast.  Around a woman's nipple, those little bumps around the nipple.  What's that area called?  The areola?  Yeah, the areola.  You know what those little bumps are for around the nipple, a woman?  Oh, that's Braille for sucking me.  Braille to suck you.  Oh, okay.  Come on, Opie knew that one.  Well, it's suck you. 
[02:58:00]  Kenny, you got another one-liner?  Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny!  Time's up, Kenny.  Hey, Tony.  Yes.  That's the best part.  What do you call a taco that doesn't belong to you?  A taco that doesn't belong to you.  Oh, my God.  He has just hey-tonied you.  Yeah, he hey-tonied you.  That's the best joke ever.  Nacho taco.  What?  Nacho taco.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And then she goes, nacho taco. 
[02:58:30]  She's a mess.  I love it.  I need sleep.  You think I need sleep?  She's perfect for it.  That's all I know.  She's perfect for it.  I know.  You guys make good money.  I'm looking for a husband for her.  I picked her.  I don't want a husband.  You ain't going to be living off me, man.  I tell you.  You find the right husband.  You find the right husband.  You find the right husband.  Tony, can Anthony rent her for an afternoon?  I'm not a rent-a-ho.  No.  I'm not a rent-a-ho.  No.  I just like the way we rent a home.  I just like the way we rent a home.  We watch movies.  We hang out.  Yeah.  He's a famous boss.  He's a kid.  I got a bar and I got a complete bar.  Are you married or anything?  Fuck no. 
[02:59:00]  You're married.  But you're not.  We're in a bar in my house and everything.  You've got to make some money there.  Fucking all kinds of good shit.  Now, which one are you?  Are you opiorentic?  What do you think, Tony?  Look at him.  Look at me.  Take two seconds to think of you.  Who's an opiorentic?  Who's a fucking drug?  Yeah, exactly.  She's on fucking drugs, Tony.  Yeah.  Actually, that's the problem.  I don't have any drugs in my life today.  Really?  Today?  What do you like?  What's your poison?  Name your poison.  I'm smoking the grass.  THC.  THC?  You like a little weed?  I don't like it.  I love it.  That's not really drugs, though. 
[02:59:30]  Exactly.  It's like a cigarette that makes you feel good.  Hey, tell what I did.  We took you to Dennis Hoff's place.  What did I buy for you?  He bought me a Renoh.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you listening?  You been there?  I'm going to name it a Renoh.  He's done your show, right?  Yeah.  Dennis Hoff has done the show.  I haven't been there yet, though.  Oh, you've got to go, yeah.  Oh, you've got to go.  What did you do with the Renoh?  Did you eat some box?  Be honest.  Be honest.  Be honest with this guy.  I took a bubble bath with her, and then I told her she didn't need a vibrator. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, because, you know, you would play the part of the vibrator.  Yeah.  Right.  So, you know, you're a little into chicks, too.  But she bought one.  I was like, you don't want that shit, girl.  Yeah, fuck that.  Get your mind right.  Put that down.  Might as well get the chlamydia right on your fucking tongue.  Jesus.  No.  They're very clean.  They're very clean.  I know.  We're all joking here.  Tony, you got one?  Uh, Kenny?  One liner?  Oh, Kenny had one.  One.  Speaking of chlamydia, that's my old girlfriend's name. 
[03:00:30]  Ew.  All right.  We hit a low here, my guys.  Come on.  I like it.  Come on.  You like that?  I'm digging this.  All right.  Hold on.  It was great.  We're going to play a round of Stump, Tony Clifton, and then we'll move on.  Nick in New Hampshire.  Yeah.  Hey, Nick.  Tony, I got one for you.  Okay, man.  Here.  Go on.  Go!  Go!  Go!  We're taking the priest up here.  Black guy.  What's his name?  Fucking piano player.  Black guy.  Black wine guy. 
[03:01:00]  What's his name?  Don't listen to the fucking radio.  Let's shut the radio off, sir.  You got him all nervous.  Let's go to Jim in Indiana.  Jim.  Yeah.  Tony.  Yes, sir.  What's the difference between a black man and Batman?  Black man or Batman.  I know it has something to do with, let's see, black man or Batman.  Is Batman could go out without Robin.  Tony Stogan.  Jeff Stogan.  You're right.  Wow.  I'm telling you, man.  It took a while, but you got it.  Yeah, you got it. 
[03:01:30]  Let's say hi to Eric in Boston.  Eric.  Hey, Tony.  Mm-hmm.  How do black women stop crime?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  How does black?  I don't know.  I know.  It's bad.  How?  What?  No, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That isn't even funny.  What the fuck?  That reminds me of, like, what's 18 inches long and has a purple head and keeps a woman  up all night screaming.  Oh, what?  Crib death.  Holy shit. 
[03:02:00]  Holy shit.  Who's this guy?  He's finally going.  He's saying, uh...  He doesn't laugh at anything.  Joe and Little Rock.  Joe.  Joe and Little Rock.  Joey.  Hello, boys.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey, Tony.  What do you call an Italian slum?  What do you call what?  An Italian slum.  Slum.  What?  Spaghetto.  Spaghetto?  Spaghetto.  Spaghetto.  Ah!  I don't like it.  I don't get it.  Write that down for the kid's show.  No, I do the kid's show Sunday afternoon.  Seriously, on the care lines. 
[03:02:30]  Two o'clock.  Yeah, I'm for real.  Got little kids coming.  Helping the little kids out.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it's community service.  I got to do it.  Part of the deal, man.  All right.  Tony Clifton.  It's a pleasure.  Guys, thanks for having us here.  Working on the new CD.  New CD.  See, R.E.M.'s doing the first song with me.  Can't wait to hear it.  Yeah, we got a lot of other big artists.  I'll come back.  I'll announce.  When we have it done.  Yeah.  I'll come back here, and then we'll play some cuts for the first time.  That sounds good.  Okay.  Bring the girls, too.  They're very nice.  Oh, man. 
[03:03:00]  Look at this.  This would have been two seconds.  Am I lucky?  Yeah.  Of us going like, all right, yeah.  Yeah, fuck Tony Clifton.  Yeah, I know.  That's their show.  But you're smart.  You're bringing something to look at.  You brought some pretty girls.  And then we put up with your shit.  And we look at the girls.  Come back, then.  I'll bring all four of them next time.  A little less cock-teasing by the broadside time.  Yeah.  A little less.  Some of those what they call whores next time.  Not these classy girls.  Yeah, go all in next time.  It's a compliment.  Say thank you, Keeley.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:03:30]  Keeley, you having a good time today?  Thank you, Keeley.  Did you have fun today?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  We don't like you either.  Oh, my God.  Do I want her at my house?  You don't even understand how much I want her at my house.  It works both ways.  Trust me.  We don't like you either.  I'll give you my phone now.  Seriously.  I'm serious.  I'm looking.  You make good money.  That's what I'm saying.  Tony, I don't want to have him.  I'm not talking about him, either.  Just go out with him.  You don't have to do nothing.  I'm talking about him.  He can take out a good dinner.  You know.  All right.  Why don't we get Tony Clifton and the broads out of here? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Okay, guys.  We love you, man.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Tony, come back and see funny.  The very funny Tony Clifton.  Thank you very much, guys.  And the Cliftonettes.  And the Cliftonettes.  It's Keeley and Trixie Meeble.  I'm not a Cliftonette.  What?  I'm not a Cliftonette.  You're not?  No, she's my newly adopted daughter.  I'm my daughter.  She's an honorary Cliftonette.  Yeah.  I was once a Cliftonette.  I got upgraded.  She got upgraded.  It's over.  Yeah, no.  I adopted her.  For real.  This is for real.  Yeah, huh?  I don't think. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  That's Dennis Hoffman.  You get Dennis Hoffman here.  You ask Dennis about Keeley.  He'll tell you.  You got good.  He doesn't like me very much.  No, huh?  No, no.  Because he wants to get on your pants.  I won't.  Oh, shit.  Right?  Tony, thank you, brother.  Big fan.  You know that.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Big fan.  Big Danny Kaufman fan right here.  Thank you very much.  Wow.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you.  There goes Tony in his bed wig.  You got to take your headphones off.  Thank you so much.  I got a kiss on the neck. 
[03:05:00]  Get me some soap.  Oh, look.  There they go.  All right.  There they go.  Tony Clifton, everyone.  Tony, girl.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'd be all up in that shit.  That blonde is hot.  The blonde's hot, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  It's just fucking just show your tits.  I like the drunk chick.  God damn.  She's right where you need her.  Oh, dude.  Right in the zone.  Right in the fucking zone.  Right in your wheelhouse.  That is the epitome of what Anthony's all about. 
[03:05:30]  Dysfunctional, fucking cute, and drunk.  God damn, I'm in love.  Yeah.  We know your type of this.  God damn.  Take a little break.  Then we'll finish with some Rob Schneider audio that we kind of teased earlier.  Some real good stuff, actually.  That went well, I think.  I don't know.  You know what?  I'll be honest.  I don't know.  It was quick.  It was funny.  You know, Kenny's fucking one-liners.  Yeah.  They stand by themselves.  They stand alone.  They sure do. 
[03:06:00]  So to add that in made the segment even better.  She was looking at us like, ugh.  And I'm like, trust me.  It's mutual.  It's a bunch.  Dude, I just love those chicks.  I thought those chicks were fantastic.  You're out of your mind.  I fucking...  There's just something about that total dysfunctionality.  How about we take a break and see what they're all about?  I fucking love it.  Go see what they're all about right now.  They're leaving.  Nah.  They're fucking...  Yeah, whatever.  There they go.  There they go.  No, go. 
[03:06:30]  All right, we'll take a break.  All up inside that.  Go, go.  No, no.  I'm not going to fuck around like that.  We'll finish the show next.  I'm not going to even go.  Opie and Anthony.  The Avenging Llama.  As Tony was walking out, he writes, Opie says I'm a big Danny Kaufman fan.  Did I really say that?  I don't think so.  Fuck if I did.  Fuck.  No, Andy Kaufman's one of my heroes, man.  Greg Opie Voss.  I got video going up in a little while.  Well, no, I got to go home, but my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, I got two. 
[03:07:00]  I got the blonde giving me the finger because I'm zooming in on her cleavage.  Oh, really?  And I also got a great video of Anthony returning the pocketbook to one of the brugs.  Well, she seems to have, she left her pocketbook in here.  Yeah.  And I thought it would be nice if I returned it to her.  So I walked down the hall, and Opie followed with the camera, and I returned it to her, and I got a nice hug out of it.  And E-Rock said that she didn't mind the boner when you were hugging her, but she minded the razor, the stubble. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I didn't shave, I haven't shaved, because, you know, I didn't know that was going to happen today.  If I knew that was going to happen, I would have shaved real nice and everything, but, you know, I'm a little stubbly.  You were in love with that one.  Dude, she's exactly, she's exactly like every chick I end up with.  Fucking dysfunctional.  She just doesn't realize that, you know.  Oh, she doesn't realize how.  No, she doesn't realize she's your new girlfriend.  Yeah, she don't get it.  She doesn't understand that yet. 
[03:08:00]  She doesn't even get how we'd hit it off.  Right.  Oh, because, let me tell you something.  I got my type.  They have their type.  And you know what that type is?  Me!  Perfect.  It's perfect.  Footer, what do you got?  Kismet!  Perhaps mode and rape.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Footer.  What's up, man?  Yo, Opa, I don't know if anybody heard your line, but it was fucking great.  You're like, Tony must have kissed her or whatever, and Opa goes, oh no, Tony just fouled her.  Yeah, it was fucking... 
[03:08:30]  You know...  I don't know why Tony Clifton wasn't doing Tony Clifton, though.  He's all about just coming in and just being a fucking tornado.  Yeah, he was a little subdued.  He was very mellow and stuff.  He was a little subdued.  He used to, like, come in and do his thing and yell and scream at everybody.  If that fucking guy wants to fucking talk to us, then come on in here and fucking talk  to us.  Oh, what's the problem?  Every day it's the same thing.  It's a guy that me and Jimmy really dislike, because the guy just walks down the hall, trying 
[03:09:00]  to be intimidating.  He stares at us.  Yeah.  And I don't even want to say his name, because last time we had a little problem with him,  he went to human resources.  But every day he walks down this fucking hall and gives us this fucking stare like he wants  to kill us.  Then come on in here, you fuck.  Go fuck yourself, Mel.  What the fuck is that about?  Frank.  He's got an issue.  Come in.  Open door.  I'm not scared of you, you piece of shit. 
[03:09:30]  Sorry.  Having fun on how to go there.  Yeah.  But yeah, I got a video of you returning the pocketbook and hugging her.  I think she kissed you.  Indeed.  Yeah, it was nice.  I like the segment.  She doesn't even understand.  Man.  I'm going to say I like that segment.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I liked it, too.  I don't really know what it was.  Yeah.  You know.  The Kenny thing was good.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, Tony. 
[03:10:00]  Kenny let us down, though.  Yeah.  That's all I hear every day when I'm driving home is another one-liner.  One-liners.  And now it's time for one-liners with one of the masters of the one-liner.  What happened, Kenny?  Kenny's, you know, he's under pressure.  That was his moment to shine.  I couldn't overshadow him.  See?  He's always thinking in the best interest of the comics.  No, he got nervous.  Be honest.  I don't give two shits for that guy.  He worked with dice.  He doesn't get nervous.  Were you annoyed by the broads? 
[03:10:30]  They smelled like liquor.  Yeah, that's all right.  I like that.  I thought it was perfume.  That's good.  I'm just not into the high and mighty attitude.  To me.  To you it is.  Yeah.  I'm not into the high and mighty attitude.  You're here with nice cleavage.  Show your fucking tits.  If you're fucking doing a tassel show on stage, then show you the goods.  Oh, the blonde.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know.  Well, I guess she has big dreams for her career.  Some nice, but natural ones she had. 
[03:11:00]  They weren't natural.  They look like they were.  Yeah.  Yes, they did.  Rob Schneider, everyone.  Yes.  Rob Schneider.  And then we're going to call it a day.  Apparently had a little to-do on a radio station.  Yeah, the audio's everywhere.  And I mean, I'm going to have an open mind.  I'm going to listen to this.  And we're going to like figure out what the hell is going on.  Rob Schneider fights with Wild 95.5.  Their morning show about having to wait in the parking lot.  Now, didn't-  When I read that, I was like, oops.  Because we've made people wait on our show. 
[03:11:30]  But sometimes you can't help it.  You've got stuff you're trying to do.  And unfortunately, yeah, you've got to wait.  Sometimes you've got to wait.  Sometimes you're on a roll.  You want to do something.  Isn't that one of the shows that were featured in Jocktober?  95.5.  I don't know, because I forget after we do it.  West Palm Beach?  Is that West Palm?  Is that the-  No, I think we did the Lopeweiser guys.  Ah, right.  Okay.  Probably not.  Right, you are.  It's Wild 95.5 West Palm Beach.  Oh, they're doing the-  Kevin, Virginia, and Jason.  They're doing the 95.5 $10,000 Fugitive promotion. 
[03:12:00]  No?  Not even contest.  Promotion.  Yeah.  Promotion.  Probably.  Let me say hi to Joe in Queens.  Joe.  Hi, Joe.  Yeah, and I'm going to ask you, would you have to barf this girl after she gives you a blowjob?  No, she was of age.  Oh, okay.  I just sounded like she was a little young.  Well, she might have been.  She was on the cusp.  Okay.  Well, you're-  I think she was right over the cusp. 
[03:12:30]  As long as you ain't got a burpee, she's okay.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Watch it out.  Let's do this.  So, approximately two minutes into interview, they finally get Rob Schneider in.  I guess he was waiting in the parking lot.  They finally get him in.  Rob brings up the fact that he had to wait in the parking lot while they finished up an interview.  Rob ends it with a witty quip.  So, what's going on?  How are you?  How was the stuff with the dancer?  Was that worth it?  I don't know.  I was out in the parking lot waiting for you, a-holes.  How was it?  Was it worth it?  Was the dancing thing worth it?  What happened in here?  I heard-  Dancing on the radio and they can't see anything. 
[03:13:00]  What's the point?  Well, you tell me because I heard that you were out there and I heard Rob's very antsy to get in here.  No, I just want to, you know.  And nothing-  Hey, look.  At 8 o'clock in the morning, I love being in the parking lot of a radio station.  Don't get me wrong.  There's a lot to do out there.  There's gum, there's cigarette butts, there's old coffee cups, there's cars to break into.  No, I enjoyed it.  But was it worth it?  Can I start yelling at a man now?  Yeah.  You can yell.  So, what happened with the dancing thing?  We were running late.  We were running late.  But what happened that was so amazing?  What was it? 
[03:13:30]  He was on the Michael Jackson movie, This Is It.  Oh, okay.  Well, that makes sense.  He was the very first backup dancer picked by Michael Jackson.  Okay, see, I didn't know any of this stuff.  He was there the day Michael died, all that.  Oh, he was there, okay.  He wasn't there, though.  He was at the Staples Center practicing for the tour with Michael.  Okay.  Yeah, he was part of that.  He's a local guy.  Well, that's, you know, well, then that's worth it.  Okay, I didn't realize it was that.  He didn't actually dance.  I wanted him to, but Kevin said dancing doesn't work on the radio.  Yeah, but the movie, it's a rehearsal.  Yeah.  I mean, how much, you know, how do you get that excited? 
[03:14:00]  It was a rehearsal.  So, you're not a Michael Jackson fan?  No, well, you know, there are lessons to be learned from Michael Jackson.  We need to know this.  You know what?  There are lessons.  We need to learn them.  Okay.  Either open up your own zoo.  Okay.  Or open up your own amusement park.  Don't do both.  Okay.  You only get so much no's.  Okay.  All right.  And that's why you were in the parking lot.  Wow.  And that's why you waited in the parking lot.  Wow.  That's exactly why. 
[03:14:30]  That's why we constantly turn him down also.  He's not funny.  I don't think he's funny.  No.  Other people would say he is.  I don't see it.  Although the goddamn Deuce Bigelow Met Movies are riot.  Hysterically funny.  Don't look at me like...  I'm trying to figure you out.  Oh, believe me.  I am lying.  Okay. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, but you're a better actor than Jimmy.  Jimmy can't keep a straight face.  That was a good poker face.  Oh, that was horrible, though.  Like, does he have pocket aces or not?  I've got to figure this shit out.  Or the 2-7 off suit.  Is that the worst hand to have?  2-7 off, yeah.  That's pretty bad, right?  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Well, what if a few 7s and a 2 pop up on the board, though?  Then you go, why did I fold it?  Fuck, I'd have a full house.  Of course.  But, yeah, it never works that way. 
[03:15:30]  Well, that's why he was in the parking lot.  I mean, they booked Rob Schneider.  They weren't excited about it.  And then when they were doing stuff they thought was better for their show, they're like, you know what?  Rob could wait.  And if he gets mad, who gives a shit?  He's not going to make our show better today.  That's how it works.  And I think Rob Schneider knows that, and that's why he's so bothered by this.  They were on a roll doing whatever the fuck they thought was worth doing, and he had to wait.  And what?  He's such a big fucking star that he can't wait?  Uh-huh.  Get out of here. 
[03:16:00]  You're not a star if you're not friends with Adam Sandler, my friend.  Well, he is, right?  Yeah, that's why he's a star, though.  Oh.  Okay, it continues.  Rob tries to recover from his bomb and gets into it with Virginia.  Oh, no.  I guess the quality of the audio is bad, but it'll get good in a few seconds, so just bear  with the beginning of this clip.  And then the awkwardness starts, because he can't let it go.  Uh-huh.  And the show is kind of giving him an out.  Like, well, we thought this was going to be a thing, and we went with it.  Yeah, they were actually giving him an out.  They should have.  Something we certainly would have given him. 
[03:16:30]  And in this show, yes, Opie would have turned and gone, hey, Rob, we were doing stuff.  Fuck you.  Exactly.  You want to get up and leave?  Fucking leave.  I don't have time for that bullshit.  You sit here, and I'd be going, oh, my God.  I have a stomachache.  Flashbacks to fucking spaghetti at the wall.  Yes.  Two shows.  Two shows.  See?  She now has you already.  That's right.  I can take it.  I make a lot more money than you.  I'm fine.  I can buy and sell you.  People like you.  I've heard that before.  I don't think you could.  You know what? 
[03:17:00]  Your action's coming out a little thicker.  Is that?  Because I know it's what we do.  It's Louisiana.  When you do the spots, you don't do the accent.  That one's fake.  This one's real.  Okay.  Thicker by the word.  You know what?  As she gets...  Angrier?  Yes.  As she gets angrier, her accent gets thicker.  I can't wait to get really angry so no one can understand you at all.  Trust me.  It's on deck.  She's getting ready to yell at somebody.  She's getting close.  You're warming up, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's getting better.  Oh, you know what? 
[03:17:30]  He is just in a pissy fucking little mood.  He's in a bitchy pissy mood.  He thinks he's a big fucking star.  Yeah.  You know, he thinks he's Brad Pitt.  Holy shit, Brad's here?  Drop everything.  Do you remember when I said, you can do it?  You can do it.  In those movies?  Kevin starts to ask Rob about doing movies in an attempt to change subjects.  So the show is trying to...  Trying to move on.  Trying to move on.  And so far, I kind of like the guys on this show.  They're doing all right.  Well, they're...  They're not pushing out.  They're being a little wimpy. 
[03:18:00]  Nah, they're doing...  They're doing all right, though.  Not everyone...  For this type of show.  All right.  I'll give them that.  So they try to ask about movies in an attempt to change subject.  Rob brings it back to the parking lot.  Host confused Norm Macdonald with Kevin Nealon.  Let's hear this.  When you're doing movies and everything else, what is it that you're shooting for?  You just continue to move?  I try to...  The only thing I can do is control if I had a good time.  You can't control the result of something.  It's like you guys.  You try to have a fun time in the morning, have your guests wait in the parking lot, and 
[03:18:30]  then try to put on a good show.  You don't...  No, but seriously.  You can't control what the Arbitron or what you guys get, the ratings.  Right.  You can't.  You just do the best job you can.  If you're only thinking about the results of something, you're never going to be happy.  That's the best you can do?  Are you mad about the parking lot thing?  No, I'm just trying to, you know...  No, you're mad.  No, I'll be honest.  Let's start over.  No, I'm not mad.  Let's start over.  We need to clean the slate.  Yeah, last time we...  I'm sorry.  Last time we...  We had Kevin Nealon in last time, and it didn't go well.  Really?  Kevin's a great guy.  I'm sorry. 
[03:19:00]  I'm sorry.  Norm Macdonald, I mean.  Norm Macdonald came in.  Norm is hilarious.  He smoked a ton of pot before he got on the air.  Yeah, well, you probably got him up.  He probably went to sleep about a half hour before you had him on.  Oh, yeah.  He did not.  Ben Nicholson?  We actually got him in on time.  Norm's a genius.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, we got him in on time.  We usually do.  That's respectful.  Yeah, well, you know what?  I'm just teasing.  I don't mind.  I don't sleep.  Let's talk about something else.  We're normally on time.  Wow, he sucks.  He fucking sucks.  Yeah, this would be a nightmare guest.  Right.  Nightmare.  We would wish for a Tony Clifton. 
[03:19:30]  Ugh.  What the hell's up with her?  She's a pig.  The hole on that show is...  Wow, they're all ugly.  Oh, who's the other one, though?  Not all, but most of them are ugly.  I could see a big, giant tit coming off the side of the screen.  That's the intern.  Yeah, we're watching the video also.  I guess they put it up on there.  Kevin begins to say that the show's very busy.  Rob interjects.  Jason erupts that Rob fight ensues.  Okay, here we go.  Finally.  We get to the fight.  We have to build up the little steam pressure.  Right.  Build up.  Yeah, I've got a lot of stuff going on. 
[03:20:00]  And it's not like...  That's why I don't want you to...  You don't have a lot of...  First of all, you don't have a lot of stuff going on.  Don't say that.  Because it's morning radio, you don't have enough stuff going on.  And that's the problem with radio.  Dude, you're a jerk, man.  Nice.  All right, brother.  All right, all right.  Nothing but respect for you, brother, whoever that guy is.  Dude, you're a jerk.  Because, you know, they did try to move on.  Yeah.  They weren't going to attack him right off the bat.  They gave him the benefit of the doubt.  He sort of was giving them the benefit of the doubt.  They both had a chance to move on.  And Rob said, no, I can't fucking move on from this.  You don't have enough stuff going on.  That's the problem. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Joe in New Paltz.  Joe.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  I hope Rap Schneider doesn't end up like Richard Jennings,  having to wait in the parking lot like that.  Yeah, we made Richard Jennings, who I guess was pretty famous.  You know, we made him wait outside the studio one day.  We let him do a prison visit.  Yeah, it was great.  Where he just talks to us through the glass on a cell phone.  It was the same type of thing, though.  He was all bothered.  Yeah, he was bothered.  He had to wait to come in our show.  He was bothered. 
[03:21:00]  We're not dropping everything for a Richard Jennings.  We dropped everything for, you know, some big stars, but not a Richard Jennings and not  a Rob Schneider.  Does this end in a walk-off or a kick-out?  Yeah, all right.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm not sure.  That's the problem with radio.  Dude, you're a jerk, man.  Why are you being a jerk?  You're acting like a jerk in front of the host of the show.  Come on, man.  Be light and friendly.  I'm so sick of this crap.  That's your interpretation.  Every time we have a comedian here, you guys think you're bigger than light.  You don't want to be a jerk.  That's your lousy interpretation.  You don't want to be a jerk. 
[03:21:30]  Why the hell do you even come into morning radio?  No, no, no.  If you hate us so bad, don't do the friggin' show of this.  Okay, well, that's a lot of baggage you're bringing to this conversation.  Well, you're right.  Honestly, this is not a fun interview.  Morning radio?  Well, that's your fault.  You don't ask anything interesting.  Why don't you have some papers in front of you and do your job and do something interesting?  You're bored.  What is it?  What is it?  You're coming to a bitch?  No, I'm not bitching.  I'm not bitching.  I'm not bitching.  I like you 20 minutes ago.  I don't care if you do it or not.  I can tell.  It's not that it shows me as a person.  All I'm saying is, my statement was, in morning radio, you never have enough stuff to do. 
[03:22:00]  It's a fact because you need more stuff.  Actually, we're pants, Rob.  You don't even know what you're talking about.  Okay, but that's...  You're coming up like a pompous ass, man.  That's not pompous ass.  Yes, you are.  It's a fact.  It's tough to get stuff, because I do these all the time.  Yeah.  You have to get enough stuff.  You bring on dancers.  You bring comedians.  You have actors, whatever.  I didn't say that to me.  Well, this is officially over.  Yeah, yeah, honestly.  I'm so sick of doing these interviews.  This is crap, man.  Yeah.  Honestly.  All right, but that's fine.  Did you walk in like, honestly, you're Elvis Presley?  I didn't walk in like... 
[03:22:30]  I didn't...  Hey, I like that guy.  Who is it?  Which one is that?  You know what?  The guy with the hat on?  That's what radio guys have to deal with, is these guys that are...  They're famous, but they think they're more famous than they are.  Yeah.  They walk in like Elvis Presley.  Yeah.  That's beautiful.  There's only a few fucking, you know, famous people that could walk in like that.  One thing...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One thing I'll give him, though.  Oh, my God.  He's so right about needing material.  For a morning show.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We're constantly scratching and clawing.  Yeah, but we're lazy, though.  These guys, you know... 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, that seems like a real radio show.  Not like this.  Yeah, it must be weird to work on a real radio show.  Like, they have papers in front of them that they prepared and things.  Right.  Hmm.  I didn't walk in like...  I didn't...  No, the parking lot.  The parking lot.  You're responsible.  I was joking.  Dude, that's your responsibility.  I was like, this is a kind of...  This is hilarious.  Hey, let me tell you what.  This is hilarious.  Hey, no, no, no.  Both of you are responsible for your own feelings, your own interpretation, and you can think it's  lousy.  I don't care. 
[03:23:30]  Dude, I liked it 20 minutes ago.  I don't care if you did or did that.  I can tell you don't.  It doesn't make a difference to me.  I'm just saying...  Well, then get the house out.  Yeah, honestly, why do you even hear that?  Bye.  This is so stupid.  Well, thanks, guys.  It was a pleasure.  No, it wasn't.  I can't say it was.  Now you have a story for it, because you wanted it to go this way.  No, we did not.  Oh, man, you suck, Rob.  He's fucking...  He's an asshole, man.  You suck.  You wanted it to go this way.  That is the last type of show that would want it to... 
[03:24:00]  Like, want controversy with a comic or anything.  They're one of these light-hearted morning shows.  That's what I...  That's what I see.  Right.  They got the hole.  They got the guy behind the board that looks like the, you know, all-American radio guy.  And then they got Tank over there, the sports guy.  Yeah, they're filling their roles.  And that's where she walks off.  All right, hold on.  We're not to that point.  We did not want this...  All I said was...  All I said was...  Hey, it was in the parking lot, joking around.  And I said, in the morning radio, they don't have enough stuff to do. 
[03:24:30]  You're always looking for stuff to do.  You came into our arena.  This is our job.  He's trying to make a fight to make it interesting for you.  All I'm saying is, I like a little...  I like a little comedy mixed in with my...  Why don't you ask a question?  Why don't you ask something?  He did.  My man tried to get into it.  He was like, off to the ground.  Sorry, parking lot, parking lot.  That's what happened.  That was a joke.  It was hilarious.  You're hilarious, by the way.  The last couple of minutes...  I never said...  Everybody is misinteresting you.  I'm really going to be a jerk.  We're all wrong. 
[03:25:00]  You're right.  You're not a jerk.  This is where the anger comes in.  Dude, I disagree with her on a daily basis.  I agree with her, Tracy-ass today.  I'm glad.  That guy's all right, man.  He's all right.  What's his name?  Jay Bird?  He should get a little promotion today.  He finally had just had it.  He finally had just had it.  And there goes Rosh.  Well, yeah, that's the last clip.  That's the last clip.  Here we're watching the video.  He just leaves.  Well, the chick leaves first, and then he leaves.  Here's the audio of that, because I don't know if you could hear the chick leave.  So we're still doing it? 
[03:25:30]  We're still going on?  No, I'm not.  I quit this bitch.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Good.  Okay.  All right.  She walked out.  Excellent.  We're one down.  I can't believe it.  This is actually going worse than the Gallagher interview.  Wow.  He at least made me laugh.  Wow.  Anyway, do you want to talk to me?  Are there any more questions, or should I split?  Well, I don't know.  I was kind of hoping that maybe we'd be able to get past, like, the first part.  And, like I said, I apologize.  No, I was just joking around.  I don't take it personally.  I don't take it personally from anything. 
[03:26:00]  Seriously.  It's not about me.  You've got a busy lifestyle.  I know you're in town.  All right.  I hate that guy.  You've got a busy lifestyle.  That's the regular radio guy.  I try to keep it up there.  Yeah, yeah.  Busy lifestyle.  I know you're in town.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's tough for you to get up in the morning.  No, no, no, it's not at all.  I had a perfectly fine morning.  I did another radio show, your competition.  It was fantastic.  Everything looked smooth.  Go back and do another interview with them, man.  Honestly.  No, it's fine.  I don't have a problem.  These never work out. 
[03:26:30]  These never work.  You set it up.  This has never happened before.  Do you guys want to talk about something else?  No, Matt, I turned off big time.  I don't want to.  I was a fan 20 minutes ago.  Peace.  Good night.  Peace.  Elvis has left the building.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, Rob just left.  I heard Howard was defending Rob Schneider in this clip.  Come on.  What a douche.  Come on, Howard.  It's Rob Schneider is being a douche.  Look, and he just leaves. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, whatever.  Man, man, I'll tell you, man, get me out of here.  Whatever.  Man, man, man, man, man, man.  Goodbye.  Well, good for them.  Yeah, they did all right, man.  They didn't sit there and take his shit.  The Jay Bird guy was awesome, if that's his name.  And believe it or not, the hole on the show was all right.  The hole was good.  She was all mad.  She threw her headphones down and walked out and said, you know, I'm out of this bitch  or whatever she said.  Yeah, what she said was a little hoot, too.  A little whatever, but yeah.  It was a little hole-ish.  Right.  I'm out of this bitch.  Yo.  Are you?  Where's, yeah, Kyle in Toronto. 
[03:27:30]  We'll explain this one.  Kyle.  Hey.  Yeah, you tell this guy it's not important because his publicist isn't in there getting  them out.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened to the publicist there?  Well, we have a lot of people that come by themselves.  Rob Schneider is, I go to the station by myself guy.  Can't afford a publicist to be doing his radio interviews for him, with him or whatever.  Oh, that was just an example of what a douche he is.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:28:00]  Nice.  That's why we say no.  Yep.  That's why we say no.  And sometimes they keep pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch.  Actually, they've come back a couple times with that one.  Yep.  Now we should have him on.  Now we'll have him on and kiss his ass.  Dude, it was so cool the way you fucking laid into those guys.  Yeah, book Rob Schneider.  Yeah, book him.  Do me a favor.  Get that done immediately.  And we'll talk about what assholes the radio show was.  Totally turn it around.  Spanky goes, wow, did this guy go to the Opie Hughes School of Broadcasting? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Make the guest feel...  Rule number one, always make the guest feel comfortable.  I feel proud of Jay Berg.  He's proud.  I'm sure he wishes he had poker chips in front of him.  Oh, shit.  He did all right, though.  He did.  You know, we beat the shit out of a lot of radio people, but, you know, fair is fair.  That whole show did okay, except for the main guy with the fake voice trying to smooth  things over.  You could tell that that...  At that point, he should have went all in with his boys and said, all right, look, tell  him to get the fuck out.  I'm sure he's not the first one that causes problems, but when two members of your show  have a major problem with it, that's when everyone should be all in, right? 
[03:29:00]  All in.  All in.  All in.  There are times I start shitting Ants Not In.  I understand that.  Jimmy.  But then there's times where, you know, we're all in.  That's an all-in situation, right?  He was just being a dick, and he needed...  And it was so good how you could tell, like, that one guy, Jay Bird, what?  I think it's Jay Bird.  Someone down there.  He was...  Give us the info.  He was, like, trying so hard to hold all that back and go, no, we'll get this interview,  we'll do it, we'll get past this.  And you could tell when he snapped and finally just went, dude, you're being a dick, you know? 
[03:29:30]  Dude, you're a jerk.  Yeah, good for them.  Rob Schneider.  Sounds like this is the type of show that has a hard-on for comedians.  South Park rips Rob...  Oh, what does South Park do to Rob Schneider?  I would love to hear this.  Oh, yeah.  Adam and Brooklyn.  I saw that one.  It's pretty good.  How you doing, boys?  Good.  Hey, man.  They did a whole episode where it was like, Rob Schneider is a carrot, and all these other,  like, ridiculous characters, because of all the stupid characters he's playing in all 
[03:30:00]  his dumbass movies.  Yeah, so they had him playing a carrot.  Rob Schneider is a carrot!  That's good, man.  That's not all he's good for.  Right on.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to...  A stapler?  Was he a stapler, too?  Mike in Wisconsin.  Mike.  Well, you fuckers are such a couple of Vince McMahon's guys can turn anybody into a heel  or anybody into a good guy.  I figure, um...  I really thought that fucking Rob Schneider was just being sarcastic like Louie would 
[03:30:30]  be.  Like, if Louie was on the park a lot, he'd make the same kind of sarcastic remark.  Well, Louie wouldn't do that.  You're getting a lot of people shaking their heads right now, Mike.  Really?  My take on it is simple.  That's some passive-aggressive bullshit.  He just thinks he's a lot more important.  He's not happy, but he wasn't willing to go all in with it.  Thinks he's a lot more important.  There might have been, like, a journal of being pissed off and irritated, but, I mean,  that guy, he's probably waited in a million green rooms, and I think he was really just  being fucking sarcastic and wanted them to play a little bit.  He wasn't being funny with it. 
[03:31:00]  He wasn't being funny at all.  And he wouldn't drop it.  I mean, you would drop it after a while if you're just kind of trying to be a little  sarcastic about it.  I don't know, man.  I think you guys must be friends with you, Rock, or something, and you guys are just standing  up for your buddies.  That's all right.  Anybody else, any other guy, like any other show like this, you guys would fucking rip them  a new asshole.  Oh, my God.  I just realized this is Rob Schneider.  Oh, hi, Rob.  What's up, man?  What's up, Rob?  No, but see, we...  It'd be funny right now.  Well, Mike, you should understand, yeah, we beat the shit out of most radio people, but 
[03:31:30]  we are fair.  They did a good job there, in general.  They got a passing grade.  All right?  All right.  And we...  We open it.  If I watch that.  It's great.  Making copies, character.  Even the Ryan Seacrest we were in and defending him until the end when he was, like, saying,  oh, thanks, thank you, thank you, thank you for coming.  Yeah.  You know, I wish he would have lost it a little more.  Well, he didn't lose it at all, actually.  No.  All right, I think that's it for today. 
[03:32:00]  Let's get the fuck out of here, I say.  Did we do anything today, Danny?  Yes.  We did everything today.  Oh, my God.  Like what?  Well...  Like what?  You guys had Tony Clifton in.  Yeah.  That was pretty cool.  And my new girlfriend.  And don't forget about the $10,000...  Oh, the 90 fucking...  Vandal.  Whatever the fuck that is.  The Vandal.  The fugitive.  Fugitive.  The fugitive.  Vandal.  That phrase graffiti somewhere.  If you want, I can think...  This is the South Park clip that that guy was talking about. 
[03:32:30]  If you want to hit it real quick.  All right.  Yeah.  At least I hope it is.  Rob Schneider.  Rob Schneider.  Derp-dee-derp.  Derp-dee-derp-dee-derp-dee-derp.  Until one day...
