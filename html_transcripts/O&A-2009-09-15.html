<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with extensive riffing on Patrick Swayze's death, fueled by numerous (and often poorly received) Twitter jokes.  A caller, "Rape Kit," contributed a Ghost sequel joke, establishing a recurring morbid humor theme. The hosts also discussed the overused phrase "brave battle" in relation to cancer deaths, briefly touching on Jim Carroll's passing and contemplating a new version of his "People Who Died" song featuring recently deceased celebrities.  This led to reflection on the show's past creative output.  A substantial portion focused on listener feedback, including those transitioning from fans to critics, and the hosts' reflections on their career trajectory.  This segment also included a detailed, joke-filled *Roadhouse* analysis and more Patrick Swayze humor.  Kanye West's tearful Jay Leno appearance prompted further commentary and jokes, as did a missed opportunity to interview P. Diddy, despite his presence nearby. A call from someone claiming to be Crocodile Dundee was briefly included.  The segment concluded with criticism of a Baltimore radio show (98 Rock, hosted by Mickey and Amelia Spiegel), featuring a comedic rendition of "I Had the Time of My Life" performed by developmentally disabled individuals.

The show then heavily criticized 98 Rock, using highly offensive and misogynistic language to describe Amelia Spiegel, offering Mickey advice while employing vulgar and sexist terminology.  Sam, a staffer, was repeatedly punished for yawning with a rolled-up newspaper. E-Rock provided audio clips from 98 Rock.  The hosts contrasted their approach to women on their show with others, referencing Howard Stern and Robin Quivers. They discussed the changing radio landscape, blaming the FCC and declining advertising revenue.  Further offensive language and sexually suggestive remarks continued throughout this segment.

The next segment discussed Leonard Romberg, a 68-year-old McDonald's employee who received a cake and gifts after 50 years of service. The hosts, along with guest Patrice O'Neal, reacted with anger and disbelief, using derogatory terms like "retarded" and "dolt" to describe Romberg. D-Boy was mentioned for bringing insufficient beer to a host's house;  an upcoming party and a golf lesson with "Boris" were also discussed.  A prank call was made to Romberg, falsely informing him of his firing, prompting concern about the potential consequences.  This segment was rife with crude and offensive language.

The following segment started with the recounting of an unnamed employee's firing ("Leonard") after 50 years, described with graphic language; a listener called in claiming to see Leonard at a bus stop. The Kanye West/Taylor Swift VMA incident fueled a lengthy, vulgar discussion, marked by racial slurs and offensive language.  This segued into discussions about Robert Kelly (a guest outside the studio), various sports, and the hosts' feelings of guilt and remorse. Patrice O'Neal was mentioned as a future guest.

The final segment covered Kanye West's appearance on Jay Leno's show, Whitney Houston's Oprah interview about her abusive relationship with Bobby Brown, and a prolonged, highly offensive conversation about rape and sexual assault. The hosts speculated about the negotiations for Kanye's appearance and compared Jay Leno's ratings to other late-night hosts.  The discussion of Whitney Houston's interview detailed graphic accounts of abuse and drug use.  The segment devolved into vulgar jokes and discussions about hitting women, rape, and sexual assault, with explicit descriptions of sexual acts and deeply offensive language regarding women.  Patrice O'Neal's San Francisco performance and a possible P. Diddy sighting were mentioned, concluding with a promotion for a fictional "Hyman Hunter" using crude sexual innuendo.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Kanye West is still an asshole, and Patrick Swayze is dead.  Good morning. Welcome to the Opiate Anthony Show.  Ha ha ha ha ha. What a joyous start to the program.  Wow, who saw this Patrick Swayze thing coming?  I know. That's crazy.  It's so tragic when it's out of the blue like that.  It just came out of nowhere.  Yeah. Terrible.  One moment we're enjoying all his fine movies, the next moment he's dead.  Yeah. 
[00:00:30]  When did this happen?  When the hell did this happen? Why wasn't I told?  Patrick Swayze.  He lost his brave battle to cancer.  I say it that way.  Wait, wait, wait. I'm going to let you finish in a minute.  I'm going to let you finish, but let me tell you something.  Michael Jackson was the biggest death this year.  You know, what about Patrick Swayze? I don't care.  Michael Jackson was the king of pop.  He actually was there from the beginning when he was a child.  And enough about it, Patrick Swayze. 
[00:01:00]  But Patrick Swayze just died, Kanye.  No, no, I'm not letting you finish. I said you could finish, but I'm really not going to let you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm going to cut you off and shit.  I'm sorry. I forgot. You're the new Kurt Cobain, remember?  One of the many things you said.  Oh, did he say that?  Ugh.  I like the last part of that one. That would be good.  Put a shotgun in his mouth.  Fucking Kanye, come on.  The news and the newspapers. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, we'll get into that.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I'm sorry.  I'm weak.  Jay Leno got Kanye West to cry?  I know.  What planet did we explore last night?  Dude, how fucking great is that?  Good call on Jay Leno's part, though.  What would your mama think?  Here's Jay.  You can act like a man. 
[00:02:00]  What's the matter with you?  Yeah, that was the most embarrassing part when he smacked him.  Yeah.  Getting back to the Patrick Swayze thing, just a quick point.  It's just one of those things that has to be said all the time.  I mean, I'm sick of things that are said over and over again.  The news and the newspaper saying Patrick Swayze lost his brave battle.  Battle.  But they say brave.  Yes.  No one's brave when they get cancer.  Yeah, how?  No one's brave.  What's the bravery part of it? 
[00:02:30]  He lost his brave battle with cancer.  No one's brave when they get cancer.  It sucks for everyone.  There's nothing brave about it.  You're like, oh, fuck.  And then you just got to deal with it.  And you try to deal with it the best you can.  Is that where the bravery comes in?  Yeah, but they just overuse that, I guess is what I'm saying.  Well, they do because everyone is brave, they say.  I think there's some cases where certainly it's a brave.  You're being brave and you're taking it on. 
[00:03:00]  You know what I mean?  I think Patrick Swayze, you know, filming that horrible show that he had before he, you know.  Right.  A past.  They canceled the show.  Then God canceled him.  Oh, see.  Well, that's what happened.  It's just, I'm just stating fact.  Let me see if it's on my Patrick Swayze joke list here.  Let me see the Patrick Swayze joke list.  Wait a minute.  These are a scream and I'm sure none of you have Twittered any of these jokes.  I'm embarrassed because I Twittered one.  Oh, no, you didn't.  No, no, you didn't. 
[00:03:30]  No.  Tell me you didn't Twitter one goddamn Patrick Swayze joke.  There's one in here that.  Oh, that's terrible.  I know.  Yeah, but when you hear it for the first time, you think it's funny.  And then you hear.  Really?  You hear the same joke a hundred times within an hour.  You're like, oh, fuck.  Well, you.  God, these are awful.  I'm just starting to read down the list.  They're terrible.  I know.  These fucking suck.  I've just been doing that all night, too.  I can't stop doing it. 
[00:04:00]  You want to start with Rape Kit?  Because I got to be honest, Ant.  Rape Kit has one I haven't heard yet.  No way.  A lot of Patrick Swayze jokes going around already.  I mean, I remember the day or the time when we waited a week.  Of your life?  Right.  Oh.  Oh, cue up the retards.  Yeah.  We got a nice song.  We'll do our memorial to Patrick Swayze.  But Rape Kit has one I did not hear yet, Anthony. 
[00:04:30]  Let's go to Rape Kit.  Rape Kit, how are you, sir?  Oh, no.  I'm kind of surprised, actually, you haven't heard this one.  I thought this was a pretty apt one.  Yeah.  But it seems now that Swayze is finally ready to start filming the sequel to Ghost.  Oh, see.  See.  But they can't get him on film.  We've yet to be able to film actual spirits.  This is literal Anthony.  Rape Kit.  Literal Anthony is speaking.  Rape Kit.  Rape Kit, how long have you been listening to the show? 
[00:05:00]  Since you guys were in your second year at WNEW.  Oh, soft.  So you do realize that I set you up horribly, right?  That's the one.  The Ghost sequel is the one I heard probably the most.  Yeah.  Hence why I went to your phone call to say.  Yes.  Saying that I never.  I was eager, Eddie.  You were set up, Rape Kit.  Yeah, well, fuck Stephen King.  I'm out.  Yeah, fuck Stephen King.  And say hi to Crawl Space for us, will you? 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  All right.  You want to run down the Patrick Swayze joke page?  Well, have you heard this one?  So, Patrick Swayze's died, you know?  Yeah.  Hey, at least he had the time of his life.  You know?  Don't do the second one because that's part of my video I filmed this morning.  Of course it is.  That worked out perfectly, by the way.  It did?  He couldn't have been a bigger ass, our intern. 
[00:06:00]  He couldn't have looked just dumber.  So, let's not even do that one.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  That'll be, uh, Ant and I do what's called Opie and Anthony extras.  We're constantly giving you guys material when these mics are off.  So, after the show, I'll upload a fine video of the intern trying to tell us a Patrick Swayze joke.  Yeah, yeah.  We haven't heard yet.  It is great.  All right.  Continue.  Uh, then we got any asshole posting how they can't wait for Ghost 2 to come out, uh, clearly has not sat through the first piece of shit. 
[00:06:30]  This one's pretty simple.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, Dirty Cancer beats Dirty Dancer.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, I know who won't be receiving Sexiest Man Alive title this year.  Come on.  Come on.  Uh, can I just say, you know, I think it's disgusting the way people are making jokes about poor Patrick Swayze. 
[00:07:00]  Right?  Can I?  Right?  Yes.  Absolutely.  You wouldn't be joking if it was someone in your family who'd been in so many shitty movies.  Right?  I gotta tell you, folks.  Ah!  Ah!  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  Doesn't it?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, you know, with Patrick Swayze rejecting his medication, uh, the time has almost come 
[00:07:30]  for his wife to start taking up pottery lessons.  Right?  Ah!  Did he say, what are you nuts?  Get out of here!  Exactly right!  I know.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Hey, Patrick Swayze, Michael Jackson, going to heaven, uh, arguing over who gets to put baby  in the corner.  Yeah.  That, that, that, that, you know, Michael has to, fuck it.  Ah!  Ah!  Let me tell you, the Patrick Swayze, uh, he claims that he's responding miraculously 
[00:08:00]  well to his cancer treatment.  Unfortunately, his agent announced Patrick wasn't responding well to his Alzheimer's treatment.  Shubish!  Yeah!  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  Oh, God.  Hey, Whoopi Goldberg's in for a busy few days, and he work, is good work, I guess.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  See, cause he's gonna talk to him.  Hee hee hee hee!  Oh.  Wow.  I gotta tell you, though.  Hey, question for everybody out there.  Hey, what's black and doesn't work?  Ah, trick question.  No, not what you think. 
[00:08:30]  Hey, stop that.  It's Patrick Swayze's pancreas.  Oh, stop.  Even the thought that you were thinking that.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Hey, why isn't Patrick Swayze gonna make it to the Oscars next year?  No, no, no, no.  Cause he's not a very good actor.  I get it.  Doesn't matter, he's dead.  Oh.  You know, you can't put baby in a corner, but you can put Swayze in a box. 
[00:09:00]  Oh!  Oh, good gravy.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, what has Patrick Swayze and Stevie Wonder got in common, huh?  I don't know.  Well, they're both not gonna see Christmas.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, you've been a great crowd.  Thank you very much.  Remember, tip your waitresses and your bartenders.  And we'll see you next time. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm actually waving in the studio here.  It's radio.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  So.  So that was all.  Those are all of the.  That's pretty much.  Twittered Patrick Swayze jokes that have made the round ad nauseum.  That's pretty much all the jokes you're gonna hear all day long today. 
[00:10:00]  All night long.  It was just one Twitter after another of stupid Patrick Swayze jokes that were being told to  me like it was the first time I saw him.  Your fax machine's gonna go crazy today.  They still use faxes, right?  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe when Patrick Swayze's pancreas worked.  Thank you.  A little encore.  It was an encore.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Thank you.  It was a long time ago.  I was only joking.  Yeah.  Well.  I was only joking.  So the Patrick Swayze thing came out of nowhere.  So we're mourning his passing. 
[00:10:30]  Damn.  Who's gonna be next?  You know, we didn't even acknowledge that Jim Carroll died.  Yeah.  The dude that sang People Who Died.  All the people who died died.  But he was very influential.  Hung out with a lot of rockers, a lot of artists.  A lot of the beatniks.  He was very influential.  That Basketball Diaries was his, you know.  Yeah.  He was one of those pop culture icons.  And a great book.  Underground guys.  Yeah.  I'm thinking we should have Kenny. 
[00:11:00]  This might be really tough, though.  Oh, wow.  This would be a major challenge.  A major challenge, because we'd have to find the karaoke version of People Who Died.  Ooh!  Wow, that's what he looked like at the end of his life?  He looks exactly like the fucking guy at the screen door in Poltergeist 2.  And I know that's been used a lot, but he really looks like him.  Oh!  You're all gonna die!  Wow!  He didn't look good.  He wasn't even that old, Ant.  I think he was only 60.  Wow.  Or he looks like David Bowie went to a concentration camp. 
[00:11:30]  Well, it does.  He's got a little David Bowie in him.  Oh, I know.  I know.  I know.  I wasn't saying that it's like that he was in a concentration camp.  I know.  Here's my version.  Oh, no.  Because I was trying it all night, Tim.  Were you doing that all night?  Hey, yeah! 
[00:12:00]  A little different, huh?  A little different.  Just a tad, but, you know, you work on these things.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  But I got boboed out a little bit.  I'm not lying.  Hey!  Yeah!  Wow.  That's uncanny.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  So, my thought is this.  I really don't know if we can pull it off.  I've been yelling and screaming on my Twitter that 2009 is the year of the celebrity death. 
[00:12:30]  I called this, by the way, in 2008.  I certainly did.  Amazing.  And I also said that Patrick Swayze would die in the year 2009.  When did you say that?  When he was diagnosed.  Yeah.  With pancreatic cancer.  With the most lethal form of cancer there is.  I think 99.9% of the people diagnosed with that one die or something.  But, you know.  But I'm still a seer, Ant.  But I'm thinking.  A seer.  Now that 2009 is officially the year of the celebrity death.  Yeah.  And Jim Carroll dying.  Yeah.  Who wrote and sang People Who Died. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, shit.  I think I see where you're going.  I don't know, man.  But honestly, this might be a project for, like, a real musician out there.  Yeah.  But a lot of people have passed in the year 2009.  You take the Jim Carroll People Who Died song.  You work something together.  And I'm thinking we got something.  Just take everyone who's died so far and throw it in the All The People Who've Died song.  Right.  Dude, you're talking viral fucking video.  And then you put all the.  And then you edit it with pictures of the people.  Right.  As you're talking about them. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Ah.  Right.  Wow.  He really.  How does a body hang on looking like that?  And he died of a heart attack.  So that's not even some kind of disease he had.  Unless he had something else going on.  He must have had something.  And then his heart said, you know something?  I'm going to mercifully end this.  Just stop ticking.  But maybe Steve could have Club Soda Kenny.  When you said maybe Steve could, I lost faith in everything that came after that.  I'm sorry.  Just happens.  Steve and I want to hear Club Soda Kenny attempt. 
[00:14:00]  I would like to hear that.  He'd be a babbling.  Because that's kind of a fast, you know, paid song.  It's almost impossible.  Yeah.  And especially with new celebrities, new people, new words.  Yeah.  Oh, that would be a rough one.  Remember the days we would come up with an idea and then we'd spend two, three hours after the show  writing our balls off.  Oh, fuck.  This doesn't quite work.  Oh, my God.  Let's rewrite this section.  Dude, you know something bigger?  What?  When we'd come up with an idea and during the commercials, write the bit and then do it. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Those were the good old days, Sam.  Remember when I'd go into another room and make a phone call?  Right.  Now I'd just pick up the bullhorn and go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Top of my head stuff.  Don't care to write.  Like, lazy, lazy, lazy, you guys suck, not as good as you used to be.  Sam, we don't have to create anymore.  Yeah, that's your job.  Zeppelin had their creative years and then they sat back and just played those tunes over  and over again.  That's the phase we're in. 
[00:15:00]  We're in the greatest hits phase of our career.  But you're still putting out hits.  Yeah, but they all sound like the old songs.  Well, we're putting out one new song on the greatest hits CD, Sam.  Our range isn't as good.  Right.  You know, we can't play as fast as we used to.  I think you guys have another classic album in you.  Yeah.  I think so.  Do we?  Yeah.  Big comeback?  Oh, well, I think you're already there, personally.  Of course.  What comeback is this?  I think we're up to our fifth or sixth comeback at this point.  How many of the...  By the way, because of just that little short thing we just said, how many of these posts, 
[00:15:30]  Twitters, whatever it is, see, they're even admitting it.  With a complete lack of identification of sarcasm, you'll get the, you know, they're even admitting  they're hung and happy.  You don't honestly take those people seriously, do you?  Yes, I do.  I spent two hours on my compound show last night just lambasting an asshole.  Oh, there you go.  But that's different circumstances.  Those are people...  Accusing me of improprieties.  Yeah, those people are just, you know, they're not fans of the show anymore, and they're trying 
[00:16:00]  to, you know, they're basically trying to bring the show down, and, yeah, you're either going  to fight them, you know, tooth and nail, or you let them be haters and spread the negativity.  It's ridiculous.  I call them full circle fans, because they go from, like, first here on the show, whatever,  blah, blah, blah, they come around, they become uber fans at the top of the circle, and then  they go right into just, not fans, hate it.  Yeah, that's what's happening with Blue Healer, Stephen S. from Bayshore, Coke Logic, Kevin 
[00:16:30]  from Connecticut.  Yeah, one of the biggest fucking perpetrators of that one.  Oh, fuck.  He used to be such a cool guy.  No shit.  I think I had him over my house a few times, which now kind of scares me, because the guy's  a little unstable.  I've seen his collection of items, and enough said.  Really?  Oh, Jesus, please.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, Steve from Bayshore is no...  He's what I call persona non grata.  Yeah.  Person not grata. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  Is an Aussie here?  Thank you.  Thank you.  I thought an Australian gentleman just had a problem.  Well, why don't we play our Patrick Swayze song, because...  Yes, please.  It seemed like Patrick Swayze was a nice guy in all.  It sucks.  Yeah.  Red Dawn, one of his shitty movies.  It wasn't a good movie, right?  I don't remember if I saw that.  Let me tell you something.  At the time when that movie first came out, it kicked ass, because we were afraid of the 
[00:17:30]  communist menace back then.  Sure.  Communist menace.  Sure.  And it was all about the communist menace invading us on a pretty conventional warfare, you know?  Pretty conventional warfare on the United States, our own soil, as they say.  And a group of young kids, just barely high school children, whose sports team was named  the Wolverines, took on this communist army that was invading America, and did some ass 
[00:18:00]  kicking.  Yeah.  Before, you know, they had to actually say, you're dead, before just shooting a guy in  the back, and the guy turns around and, you know, kills him.  Never talk before you shoot somebody.  Don't try to get a clever quip in.  Just shoot him, Patrick.  Just shoot him.  Yeah, it was a big movie back then.  Of course, there was also, what was that movie where they had the little gang fight there? 
[00:18:30]  Outsiders.  The Outsiders was just a bevy of little Brat Packers of the day.  I believe we had Charlie Sheen was in that one.  Was he?  No.  Tom Cruise was in that one.  Was the Karate Kid in that one?  Are you sure Charlie Sheen wasn't in that?  I don't know, Ant.  Oh, Charlie Sheen was in Red Dawn.  Why do we feel like we have to talk about-  Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, that's the Karate Kid.  Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise.  Leif Garrett.  With the last few strands of hair on his head.  Leif Garrett.  That was the movie, when they said, cut, it's a wrap, he put a bandana on his head and  became that guy.  And Opie.  Yeah.  Oh, C. Thomas Howell.  Of course.  Who was fantastic when he did Soul Man.  Soul Man.  Yeah, where he put the black face and went to school.  But he didn't look black.  Sam looks more black than he did in that movie. 
[00:19:30]  Of course he does, because he is.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  And Roadhouse.  I just can't- I can't go through the Swayze collection without mentioning the greatest  movie ever made.  One of Kevin Smith's favorite movies of all time.  Roadhouse?  Roadhouse.  Was it- is it one of those movies that sucked when it first came out, but then found its audience  afterwards, because-  Opie, you're using the word sucked with such a wide stroke.  Well, that's why I asked you. 
[00:20:00]  Sucked could be anything from, hey, I had great lasagna a week ago, and this lasagna sucks.  Mm-hmm.  That is so far from the way this movie sucks.  There should be a new word for suck.  It was- it was so bad it was good.  So bad-  It's one of those things, right?  It's so bad-  Right.  That it's fantastic.  Mm-hmm.  It's not so bad that it's good.  So bad, fantastic.  See, that's what I tell myself, Anthony, when I go home. 
[00:20:30]  I'm so bad-  So bad-  On the radio show that people-  That you're fantastic.  Really like it.  Yeah.  I'm so bad, it's good.  Roadhouse?  What are you talking about?  Ghost was probably the best Patrick Swayze movie ever made.  I gotta tell you, Ghost was the best movie.  You say Roadhouse, I say Ghost.  I'm gonna let you finish in a minute.  Shut up.  Stupid Kanye.  Fucking-  I don't know what I'm thinking.  Got a fucking nav system on his head.  Right.  Turn left at your ear.  The fuck? 
[00:21:00]  How does he do that?  What?  That road map on his head.  Oh, oh.  It's like, uh, uh, and then he was rubbing it last night while he was, uh, crying.  Oh, sorry!  It's Kanye from last night.  I did so many bad things!  Yeah.  That's Kanye from, uh, uh, Leno last night.  And then this was, uh, so bad.  I tried to do-  Oh, you try.  I understand.  You made me mad.  We come too fucking weak! 
[00:21:30]  Well, you're a good man, Kanye, for coming on the show.  It's, uh, fantastic.  I understand you could be weak.  Oh, sorry!  You apologize.  She was, uh, taken aback by you.  I did so many bad things!  Yes, yes.  It was her moment, and, uh, her moment, and you ruined it.  You don't cry in front of Jay Leno.  No!  You sound like an idiot!  Because Jay Leno, I've never seen Jay Leno make a serious face in my life.  No, he was like, ah, he was horrified.  Was he horrified?  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Her hair turned white, right there. 
[00:22:00]  Jay Leno wasn't horrified.  No, he loved it.  Jay Leno's sitting there going, oh my god, this is great for my new show.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Of course.  The ratings for Jay Leno's first show are gonna be just completely through the roof.  Through the roof, yo.  And, uh, tonight is the night that little Jimmy Norton makes his appearance on the new Jay Leno show.  Yes!  So make sure you're watching.  Can't wait to see that, our little pal.  Here's Patrick Swayze, uh, from Roadhouse.  All you have to do is follow three simple rules.  One.  What?  Never underestimate your opponent. 
[00:22:30]  This is, uh, let me just set it up a little bit.  Sure.  Roadhouse, um, he plays, uh, Dalton.  Uh, and, um, he's a bouncer, okay?  Is he?  He's the best bouncer in the country.  Uh, on the bouncer circuit, by the way.  Which, who the fuck knew there was a bouncer circuit?  Where everyone knew, like, who the best bouncer was in the country.  So Roadhouse is having some problems.  Want to kind of clean up the place a little bit.  So they bring Dalton in to clean up the fucking mess. 
[00:23:00]  And he comes in now, and this place has just been a bloodbath.  And everyone's, like, stealing from the till, and the bouncers are just a bunch of fucking boneheads.  They just looking to rack some head.  And they're causing half the problems.  So Dalton comes in, sits everyone down.  First he tells the boss, look, you want me here to work, everything's gotta be done my way.  I lay down the rules.  So then he gathers everyone together, and he gives them the rules of bouncing.  Oh, shit.  That he's learned from experience.  From years and years of throwing people out on their heads. 
[00:23:30]  Being the premier bouncer on the circuit.  But why didn't the bar just get, like, the mafia involved?  To clean up.  Or to anyone but Swayze.  The premier fucking bouncer.  It was the dumbest plot for a movie ever, ever, ever.  Wait, I might have one.  I guess God needed a bouncer at the pearly gates.  Ah!  I'm working on it.  That would be good.  I'm working on it.  Swayze standing out there with his arms crossed.  I gotta write, I gotta work on this one a little bit.  But I got something there.  Bouncer, pearly gates, God, I guess. 
[00:24:00]  Point Break was good.  Somebody's mentioned that.  Point Break I liked.  Does it hold up, though?  That Point Break?  Yeah, I watched it.  It was kind of fun.  It was kind of a good movie.  I always look to Travis for approval.  I don't know why.  I find myself looking at Travis going, it's a good movie.  And I go, I look at Travis, it's a good movie?  And I always shake my head.  And then I go, yeah, it was a good movie.  Yeah.  Why do I do that?  I laughed at all your Seinfeld jokes.  Thank you.  I know, sir.  They're all for you.  Because we all like when a girl likes you.  Maybe that's a wow.  I never even thought of that. 
[00:24:30]  See, that's a common misconception.  I'm playing to the girl in class.  Yes, of course you are.  And hoping she likes me.  Travis making some appearances on my videos.  Yeah, luckily I have something to bring in.  It didn't go unnoticed.  And you're prominently featured in this morning's video.  That'll be up later.  Yeah.  This morning's video is going to be very funny.  They're all funny, Travis.  What can I tell you?  No, I mean, you know.  Yes.  Donnie Darko.  He's good in Donnie Darko.  Yes, he was, Anthony.  Thank you, sweetie.  You know how people say they're young filmmakers and stuff? 
[00:25:00]  I'm an old filmmaker.  An old filmmaker.  So this is Patrick Swayze.  And then I got something with God wanting maybe like a Chippendale show because of the...  The famous bit from SNL where him and Farley, you know, I bet in heaven right now, Jesus  is laughing his ass off watching Farley and Swayze reenact that Chippendale's audition bit that they did on SNL. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  That was a good one.  Oh, hysterical.  That was a good one, Ant.  I want to see the cartoons.  Any cartoons yet on this?  Uh, no.  Patrick Swayze's death is a big one.  That's a biggie.  Yeah, that is.  As far as deaths go, that's a biggie.  He's had quite a long, illustrious career for such a, you know, relatively young gentleman.  Well, let's learn the three rules to bouncing.  Three rules to bouncing.  From Roadhouse.  Yeah, Dalton.  And I guess I would suggest that you watch Roadhouse. 
[00:26:00]  Because, you know, a lot of people, when someone dies, they go, oh, I got to watch their stuff now.  Yes.  And they're going to watch that dumb movie with the dancing.  Yeah.  Don't watch the dumb movie with the dancing.  Oh, Dirty Dancing?  Yeah.  Watch Point Break or Roadhouse in honor of Patrick Swayze.  Get the put-em-in-a-box set.  See, because he's, oh, Jiminy Cricket.  How do I come up with him?  Well, Larry King is checking in.  Wow, is he?  Anthony, yes.  Larry. 
[00:26:30]  Patrick, how important is the pancreas?  Oh, Larry.  Oh, no.  Apparently very.  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  Aye, aye.  I didn't know this.  I'm getting a little knowledge on Patrick Swayze.  We got Walter in Pennsylvania.  Walter?  Yes, I do.  In early Patrick Swayze career there, he played a soldier on MASH, and he was diagnosed with leukemia.  And they didn't have a treatment, you know, still done today. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  Foreshadowing.  Fucking 50 years later.  Yeah.  Well, Dice is also in an episode of MASH, by the way.  Yeah, pretty much everyone plays a soldier, right?  Yeah.  So, that's all I got.  Punch it out.  Thank you, sir.  That's Walter.  All right, so let's learn the three rules of bouncing.  The rules of bouncing as per, yeah.  All you have to do is follow three simple rules.  One, never underestimate your opponent.  Unless it's pancreatic cancer.  Expect the unexpected. 
[00:27:30]  Black pancreatic cancer.  Two, take it outside.  Never start anything inside the bar unless it's absolutely necessary.  And three, be nice.  Come on.  If somebody gets in your face and calls you a cocksucker, I want you to be nice.  I want you to suck his cock.  Okay.  Ask him to walk.  Be nice.  If he won't walk, walk him.  But be nice.  If you can't walk him, one of the others will help you, and you'll both be nice. 
[00:28:00]  They don't like this rule.  I want you to remember that it's a job.  It's nothing personal.  Uh-huh.  Ain't called a cocksucker impersonal?  No.  It's two nouns combined to elicit a prescribed response.  Shut up.  He's smart for that.  Don't wonder if somebody calls my mama a whore.  Is she?  Oh. 
[00:28:30]  I want you to be nice.  Until it's time to not be nice.  Oh.  Well, uh, how are we supposed to know when that is?  You won't.  I'll let you know.  Oh.  You are the bouncers.  I am the cooler.  Damn.  All you have to do is watch my back and each other's.  And now he's in a cooler in a hospital.  Take out the trash.  Well, take out the trash.  You'd think there was ever. 
[00:29:00]  I never thought there was actually a movie where they said take out the trash.  When they mean like the bad guy.  Unless it's somebody actually taking out garbage.  How did he stay serious?  That's ridiculous.  Dialogue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is so bad.  And the movie is full of dialogue just like that.  So please enjoy.  If I didn't know any better, I would think that he's talking about being a soldier in Afghanistan or something.  Be nice to the people.  Hearts and minds.  Right, right.  Hearts and minds.  Watch my back.  All this stuff would be something a soldier would say.  Not a bouncer. 
[00:29:30]  Every night is just crazy.  Every night at the roadhouse.  Is it crazy or crazy?  You don't even understand.  Every night.  It's crazy.  There's fights.  I don't know how many spare tables they have in the back.  Because so many get broken on a nightly basis.  Why don't they just call the cops?  You call the cops enough, people are going to go, you know what?  We can't pull any shenanigans in this place.  Because the cops are all in cahoots with the bad guy that ends up coming in at the end.  Or at the middle of the movie.  Or I think it's the mafia again.  Well, no.  It's in the sticks. 
[00:30:00]  And, by the way, every night the same band plays.  And it is Healy?  Jeff Healy.  Jeff Healy, the blind guitar player.  He plays every night.  And what an actor he is, let me tell you.  When he has to deliver lines to Swayze, you'd think this guy, I mean, Oscar.  Oscar winning.  I hate Jeff Healy.  Roadhouse.  Can I just throw that out there?  We were forced to play.  So did God.  What, is he dead?  No, he's blind.  Oh, did I think?  Jeff Healy. 
[00:30:30]  We were forced to play some Jeff Healy records.  Yeah, back in the day.  When he first came out.  And it was like, what the fuck?  Stevie Ray Vaughan blows this guy out of the water.  Let's just play another Stevie Ray Vaughan song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's Stevie Ray Vaughan wannabe.  I just lost my ID.  So now I don't think I can walk around the building today.  Great.  Oh, shit.  Don't walk around without your papers.  He goes, where are your papers?  Why don't we take our first break, Anthony?  Because the Kanye West thing is just amazing.  Yeah.  And Pink.  Pink is telling it like it is. 
[00:31:00]  And I can't wait to play what Pink has to say about the Kanye West thing.  Oh, is she?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She's, I don't know if you know this about Pink, Ant.  She's a tough broad that doesn't take any guff whatsoever.  She tells it like it is.  I'm watching Swayze kicking some ass with a pool cue.  Yeah.  And it is just some of the best.  Go, Swayze.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Yeah.  Fucking Swayze.  This is horrible.  What did that guy do? 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  Hey.  Come on.  Oh, man.  Oh, that was the other bad guy.  How's there bad guys?  People just want to drink after a hard day's work.  No, no.  What the fuck's going on with this movie?  The roadhouse is the place to fight.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  And they're all looking around like he is a good bouncer, this guy.  Swayze should get in there, I think.  He's beating up Swayze's pal.  Guy's a little old to be a bouncer, this guy.  This Swayze guy is causing a lot of lawsuits. 
[00:32:00]  No, this is the.  It's the beef.  It's what's for dinner voice guy.  What?  What's his name?  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah, Swayze.  Come on, Swayze.  Kick ass.  Here it goes.  All right.  That's enough.  You can't just shoot a gun in a bar.  You can't shoot a gun in a bar without there being police.  Cops will show up.  But no, no.  The cops don't show up here. 
[00:32:30]  Not at the deuce.  Whatever it is.  The fucking.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Someone's saying Jeff Healy.  Ken in Jersey.  Ken?  Is Jeff Healy dead?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah.  Jeff Healy died probably, I don't know, like last year.  Of what?  Are you kidding?  I don't know.  Well, I have no idea, but I know he's dead, because I remember he was a big figure on  the Roadhouse.  Oh, I bet he never saw it coming.  Nope.  Not seen it coming.  Yikes.  Later, guys.  I was hung out there for a couple of seconds.  You gentlemen scared me. 
[00:33:00]  Jeff Healy died?  What did he die of?  Of?  Don't tell me pancreatic cancer or that fucking set of Roadhouse's Curse.  Jeff Healy died of one hit Wanderism.  Oh, did that happen?  How many hits did he have?  Surgery to remove...  What?  Wait a minute.  Surgery to remove what?  Underwent...  What?  Oh.  That movie from his resume.  What happened?  Let's see.  Healy underwent surgery to remove metastatic tissue from his lungs. 
[00:33:30]  And 18 months later, he had two sarcomas removed from his legs.  What the fuck?  He died of the big casino.  The big casino got him.  What about the other...  Get to the goddamn Internet Movie Database.  And punch up Roadhouse.  Stat.  Stat.  Why?  What happened?  Because I have a theory here.  There's a Roadhouse curse?  There's a Roadhouse curse.  Oh, shit.  Roadhouse curse.  You're hearing it here first.  Okay.  There it is.  Roadhouse 1989, by the way, if anybody's wondering.  Go to...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ben Gazzara. 
[00:34:00]  Ben Gazzara.  Yeah?  Is he alive?  Yeah, he looks alive, man.  Come on.  Okay.  Well, he doesn't look good.  Okay.  Go back.  He's an old guy.  One more.  One more.  One more.  Because I got to wonder if that guy that used to be on Adam 12.  Is it Adam 12?  Adam 12?  You know how old that show is?  Kevin Tye.  Kevin Tye.  Kevin Tye.  Oh, yeah.  He's alive.  Is he alive?  Your theory sucks.  There's no Roadhouse curse.  Your theory sucks.  Holy shit. 
[00:34:30]  Anthony, Tony Danza checking in.  Mr. Danza, it's a pleasure.  Hey, how you doing over there?  Hey, Tony.  What's up, Tony?  Hey, listen.  With this whole thing with Patrick Twayze, I'm beside myself.  I just want to say, you know, hearts and minds, thoughts and prayers.  Thank you, Mr. Danza.  Just be nice.  Oh, this is Danza's cock picture.  All right, Sam.  Everyone, anytime we talk about Danza, they got to pull up that old black and white picture  and with his big hog hanging out. 
[00:35:00]  Big delicious hog.  In honor of the passing of Patrick Swayze, we're going to play one of our favorite songs ever.  This is an ONA original.  One of our fans worked at a karaoke booth.  It was at an amusement park.  Amusement park.  Where you can go in and record a song and have it come out as like, I believe back then,  like a record or maybe a DVD or I mean a CD.  So there was a retarded field trip that went there and they brought a couple of retards in 
[00:35:30]  to do a duet of the famous song from Dirty Dancing, I Had the Time of My Life.  And this listener recorded it knowing that we would play it on the radio.  And sent it right to us.  And now it's just everywhere.  This song is everywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Just remember, we were the first ones.  Just like that DJ douche that played the Beatles song.  That DJ douche has I Want to Hold Your Hand.  We have retarded I Had the Time of My Life.  Oh, I learned a little more about that guy.  Did you? 
[00:36:00]  Stephen King references him in the Entertainment Weekly column where he trashes us.  What was his name again, that DJ?  This DJ, Stephen King wants radio to go back to the days of Cousin Brucie and this other  guy whose claim to fame was he played the Beatles' I Want to Hold Your Hand first in America.  Right.  So, got a lot of info last night from a lot of people on Twitter, Ant.  Did you know that this DJ didn't even know the song? 
[00:36:30]  What?  He started getting requests from the listeners.  So, it wasn't even hand-like.  So, he had to run around the studio going, what is this song everyone's requesting?  I gotta play it.  Someone get me a copy.  He had no clue.  It wasn't like he discovered this.  Yeah, so he didn't break it and say, wow, this is really good.  I need to play this.  No.  Let me intro this to the people.  No, he was just taking requests.  Oh, my God.  He took a request.  That's all it was.  Carol James.  That's right.  His claim to fame, he played the Beatles' I Want to Hold Your Hand first on American radio. 
[00:37:00]  But he didn't bring that record to the station that day.  No, the listeners did.  He had no idea.  He didn't know anything about the record.  The Bobby Soxers.  The Bobby Soxers.  The Bobby Soxers.  The Bobby Soxers.  All right.  Why don't we get to break with this little ditty from a couple of tards?  Kanye West stuff next.  I mean, Pink, watch out.  Oh, jeez.  You don't want to get on her bad side.  And let's talk about Pink's music.  Like, enough about being empowered. 
[00:37:30]  We get it.  Tough.  Right.  Why don't you just be a woman and lay down?  Her shoulders are too big to be a woman.  Huh?  Her shoulders are too, like, wide to be a woman.  Yeah.  Get a list of her songs, because they're all about being empowered.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Open, Anthony.  Love it.  I'm very nervous, Anthony.  I've just been informed that we're going to be interviewing P. Diddy.  What, Sam?  Yeah, that is a big get.  Holy crap.  What are we going to ask P. Diddy? 
[00:38:00]  Big get for the show.  That's a really big get.  It's about time we get the A-listers in.  Especially on the heels of all this controversy that's going on in the rap and R&B community.  You guys, he's not doing the show.  And what show isn't he doing?  Wow, they must feel fucking stupid.  No.  Because he's in the building.  He's in the building.  And he's doing shows.  So he's going to come in here.  We'll talk to him.  Yep.  And then he's not doing the show.  What show?  What show isn't he doing?  He is doing hip-hop. 
[00:38:30]  To the D.  Okay.  To the D.  De-de-dee.  De-de-dee.  De-de-dee.  De-de-dee.  De-dee-dee.  De-dee.  De-dee.  De-dee.  De-dee.  I.  De-dee.  De-dee.  De-dee.  De-dee.  De-dee.  You guys don't take him seriously.  What?  And to the I.  To the G.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, Jesus.  Whoa.  What?  To the G.  To the...  What?  Yes.  Just stop. 
[00:39:00]  I was starting a new word.  Red Pal?  Red Pal.  I was starting a new word.  It's two o'clock.  And you're tall.  Yeah, so, wow.  I'm crazy.  What time is the interview?  He's doing Hip Hop Nation.  All right.  Then Shade 45.  Okay.  Oh, so that's right there.  Then walking right to our studio.  What is that about, Sam?  So, you're talking our home base right here in our studio.  His house. 
[00:39:30]  Or maybe his office.  Bad Boy Enterprises.  So, you're going to be doing a kind of backstage with?  I very...  I postured myself for that, but it was...  Yeah, it did not.  Bent over and took it in the ass.  I would have.  Is that how you postured?  I would have.  We're going to have a security guard face-off today.  Is he going to walk right past here to get to...  I mean, he'll probably be on that side.  But, yeah, he'll be right.  He's going to be in that studio.  I'm shooting freaking HD Flip today.  No.  Oh, my God.  What did HD Flip ever do to you? 
[00:40:00]  HD Flip, yo.  Oh, I thought he was a rapper.  That you're threatening with bodily harm.  Can I continue my song, please?  No.  No, no, no, no.  No, no.  D.  To the U.  To the M.  To the M.  To the Y.  That's not his name.  It's Dummy.  That's not Dummy.  It's Dummy.  Dummy.  This is Y.  Dummy.  Dummy.  He'll be upset if you guys try to talk to him.  You do not take him seriously.  All right.  Well, Sam.  Na-na.  Na-na.  Na-na.  Na-na.  Na-na.  Na-na. 
[00:40:30]  Anthony, we got Crocodile Dundee checking in.  Oh.  Ah, nice.  Yeah, let's see what's here.  Let's hear him.  Uh, Mr. Dundee, how are you?  Hey, boys.  How's it going there?  Doing all right.  Hi.  All right.  Last night, when I was sitting on me couch, opening me knife, I was watching the telly,  and the news came on, and I see that Patrick Swayze, he dies, and the first thing I said  was, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Aye, nigh. 
[00:41:00]  We got a good bit, Sam.  That's one of my favorite bits right now.  So we got P. Diddy coming in, what, around 930, 945.  That's good news.  To the building.  And then that, uh, the, uh, the governor of, what, Illinois, the ex-governor?  Rob Blagojevich.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Blagojevich is doing our show, too?  No.  What's his name?  Blagojevich.  Oh, I thought it was Blow Me Bitch.  No.  No.  That's not his name.  It should be.  Motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He doesn't have time. 
[00:41:30]  What do you mean he's-  To blow people?  We're not talking to him, either?  No, he's doing every show in this building.  For real?  Uh, well, yes.  We're in the building, man.  Okay, so he's doing our show.  Except.  Oh, there's an except.  Right, except Opie and Anthony.  What is with this fucking show-  The one show.  That we can't get, uh, P-Douchey or fucking-  Okay, well, I think it's very obvious why you can't get P-Douchey.  I wouldn't have called him P-Douchey if, uh, if, uh, he was coming on the show.  That's right.  You said mean things yesterday, and you said-  Because we knew he wasn't gonna do our show. 
[00:42:00]  I just felt it.  I just felt it.  Yeah, we knew ahead of time, Sam.  When are you gonna realize we're seers?  I do.  You know, fucking, we got Patrick Swayze's books for next week.  That's the guest we fucking get.  What's up, B-Rog?  This should make you feel good.  He's doing Broad-Minded.  Who is it?  That's the Broadway channel?  No, that's the-  No, that's the-  The all-female talk show.  Oh, Broad-like broads.  Wait, which-  Who is?  Blagojevich?  Blagojevich, yeah.  I don't-  You know what?  Uh, uh, well-  He's doing every single show. 
[00:42:30]  I don't understand you're trying to promote something, so you go on channels that have  no listeners.  For real.  You have no listeners.  Why wouldn't you come on our-  It's a known fact that we're one of the biggest channels on XM, if not the biggest channel  on XM.  So why wouldn't you come on our channel and you get the word out there?  Broad-minded, what-  What are you gonna do?  You're gonna get four bimbos to buy your crap.  Right.  You get it from a different perspective.  Oh, shut up, Sam.  Oh, enough.  Jesus.  Different perspective.  You got an answer for everything, you fucking dolt. 
[00:43:00]  Anthony, we were gonna do our Kanye West segment.  Uh, we certainly were.  And we have jokes-o-plenty.  Yeah.  Oh.  But, E-Rock ran down the hall.  Well, could you really call it a run?  You know what?  I'm gonna be Team E-Rock today.  Yeah?  No E-Rock jokes today, E-Rock.  You watch.  It's gonna be hard, but I'm gonna try, my friend.  Okay.  Because the excitement I saw on this little fella running down the hall with this CD, just put a light in my soul. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, like E.T.  It's- I was just so happy.  I'm like, look at the passion this guy has.  He couldn't get in here fast enough.  Sam, I said-  I said I'm Team E-Rock today.  Sam has put up a picture, a Photoshopped picture of some big fat titted mess with E-Rock's head photoshopped very nicely on top.  I don't appreciate that.  Yes, I'm with you, E-Rock.  Sorry, I was just looking for a picture.  Just a point of reference. 
[00:44:00]  So, E-Rock ran down the hall with the latest audio from Mickey, Amelia, is that her name again?  Amelia, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there was a great Amelia joke yesterday.  My God.  Did you hear it?  Yeah, I heard it.  Okay.  And Spiegel?  Spiegel.  Spiegel?  Smeagol?  Smeagol?  Smeagol?  Lord of the Rings.  What is it?  It's Spiegel.  Spiegel.  It's a morning show-  Spiegel-y.  Out of Baltimore.  From the Spiegel catalog, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  He used to give away gifts from-  Ah, it goes way back.  Re-span.  And they're a morning show out of Baltimore, 98 Rock.  Who wants to explain this from yesterday?  And you're really good at explaining.  I get a little wordy and I stutter through all my shit.  It's a radio show, yeah.  They're on 98 Rock, Baltimore, and there's four people involved with this, three guys,  one whole.  And apparently, the producer listens to our very program, right here, the Opie and Anthony  show. 
[00:45:00]  And it seemed that the two hosts of the show, the two guys and the girl there, were not  really thrilled with the fact that this guy listens to our show, which we took as a bashing  of the show.  And then they did do a little bashing of the show, you know, saying that we cursed a little  too much, that the host couldn't drive in listening to the word cunt every two seconds,  as he said we say it, which, you know, some days we do use it a lot.  Some days we never use it.  But we're on satellite radio.  They're on regular radio.  So be it. 
[00:45:30]  That's how it works.  So we kind of, you know, we instantly jump the gun.  When we feel a little bit of an attack, we go, ooh, ooh, right in there.  Oh, yeah.  And it may have been a little premature, because later in the day, we had gotten some more clips  of their show, and Mickey was talking and saying, look, I'm not bashing the show.  I like those guys.  He said, I even think that, you know, they're better than Howard.  And I've said that.  I don't want to be the, put on the chopping block for their fans and things like that.  I, I, I, so he was being honest and saying he likes the show. 
[00:46:00]  So we kind of embraced Mickey a little more.  We kind of took the high road for once.  And, and, and, and he's a stand-up comic.  We listened to some of his comedy, open-minded, and said, you know something?  It's not that bad.  It wasn't bad.  It's every, you know, it's like every other comic out there.  They got their, their material.  The fucking crowd was laughing.  How could you fault them?  HBO isn't going to be calling any, any time soon, but.  But I'm sure he's doing very well there in Baltimore.  He definitely gets the job done.  He can plug the shows on his show and things like that.  Good reaction from his comedy.  But the whole.  And did you explain, because I tuned out for a while. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I did too.  My mouth just keeps going and I go to sleep.  Their producer, Mike, is a big fan of our show.  Yes, I did add that.  Yes, and he listens.  But it sounds like Mickey also listens to our show.  Mickey is forced to listen sometimes when he commutes in.  Okay.  With the producer.  All right.  But he said he does enjoy the show.  He thinks we're funny and everything.  And, and that was that.  But the whole, the whole would not stop.  She kept adding barbs in.  Wham, wham.  I'm keeping, I'm, I'm keeping Sam up, I think. 
[00:47:00]  Am I keeping you up, Sam?  No.  So, big ass yawn.  Not.  Big ass yawn there, Sam.  You all right?  I sucked in a little too much air.  All right.  What the fuck was that about, Sam?  It's a little bored with my fucking recap.  I don't want to bored at all.  I know it's a recap.  You've heard it before, but this is for the listeners.  I was looking at Amelia's picture.  It's for the benefit of the listener.  Amelia's picture is what I was looking at.  I got your board?  Yes.  All right.  I'll accept that.  Why don't you leave the studio, Sam?  Aww.  And think about what you just did.  And come back when.  Yawning in my face.  And come back when you realize what you did. 
[00:47:30]  Okay.  That's good.  I'm just gonna, you know, next time you go fucking rattling off some wrestling shit,  I'm just gonna.  Make sure he doesn't come back until he realizes.  Yes.  What he did.  What he did.  Make a stand in a corner.  And I want him to, you know, express what he did.  Yeah.  So the hole wouldn't shut up.  And then we just started talking about how these guys don't need the hole.  Right.  Don't need the hole. 
[00:48:00]  They seem to be a good cohesive show with the guys.  And that the girl is thrown in by management.  And we know that.  And they can be funny.  They seem like guys that just hang out and talk about shit.  You know.  Why throw a girl in there to fuck it all up?  Yeah.  These one market sensations, they want to be bigger than they are.  We were a one market sensation.  Of course we were.  So we completely understand this.  You gotta start there.  It's like a monopoly.  You can't start with hotels.  Our new goal is to make the hole in radio extinct. 
[00:48:30]  Lose the hole.  For real.  Someone actually got losethehole.com and emailed me.  Oh, really?  Said if you want it, it's yours.  Dude, you know what?  We should buy losethehole.com.  And then we should just feature all the holes from these rock morning shows.  A photo and a little audio clip.  Yes.  Perfect.  Who wants to do it?  I like it.  Because we don't do anything anymore.  Someone take the ball and run with that.  Someone run with that.  I'm much too busy in my pool and not associating with the general public anymore.  You haven't even admitted it on his show. 
[00:49:00]  I lie.  I know.  So.  I guess this might be the year we're fired, right?  Could be.  Yeah.  Anyway, yeah, that's a great idea.  We'll get all the holes from America and we'll feature them all on one website.  Look, there's a place for women in radio.  There really is.  They're perfect midday jocks.  Midday jocks.  Soft rock.  Midday jocks. 
[00:49:30]  They keep the music going while you're in your cubicle.  They're not going to.  Light FM had.  Some light FM action.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're good that way.  You know, wear a short skirt and maybe do some news.  How about the overnight girls from the past?  Overnight girls with the sexy voices.  Alice and Steele.  Even though they're fucking butt ugly.  We're doing the three.  That's why they do overnight.  Yeah.  So they could leave like the elephant man in the cover of darkness.  And if anyone does see them, they're drunks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They think they're like, wow, she is pretty good looking. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, no, she's not.  I'm just drunk.  We're going to be cruising through the midnight hour.  And they have that soft spoken voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm going to be with you here until four in the morning.  That's a great shift.  Oh, great shift.  Any anybody that is listening is jerking off to your voice.  How does that make you feel?  Just she's condemned to just fuck in the daylight.  It's the only time she can fuck.  So our new goal, Anthony, is to destroy the hole.  Yeah.  You know, I think the hole's got to step up their game. 
[00:50:30]  I have an open mind.  I think.  Change your act.  Yeah.  I think women can certainly fit into some of these, you know, morning shows.  Yeah.  It's not for us.  We learned that a long time ago.  And that's the advice we were given this show in Baltimore.  We're like, all right, there's two things.  Now that we sort of like you.  Yeah.  You backed out of the controversy.  Nice.  You saved face.  He played it perfectly.  He really did.  Well played, Mickey.  Well played.  And the advice is simple because they want to be, you know, a huge show in Baltimore and 
[00:51:00]  possibly get syndicated to Washington or something or whatever.  However that works.  He's got to like.  Be careful what you wish for.  He's got to start using his real voice.  Yeah.  That is key.  That's something I learned from Brother Weez.  Yeah.  He's got one of these voices that everybody seems to have in radio these days.  Right.  Right.  Kind of a little gravelly, that sing-y, song-y, little energetic thing going on.  And get rid of the hole.  Yeah.  Somebody that does well, I got to admit, is Kelly from Pugs and Kelly.  Yeah.  She's a woman on a guy talk radio show that does very well because she doesn't play the 
[00:51:30]  whole part.  Yeah.  She's right in there.  If they're there jumping in.  She's right in there scrapping.  Jumping in like they got a fucking set of balls.  That's fine.  Right.  If you're just using your vagina.  Right.  Stop.  So with that.  Your vagina.  I think that's a pretty good setup.  And with that, E-Rock came running down the hall.  I'll be honest with you.  We were going to just move on from this bit.  We were like, okay, we did what we did yesterday.  We don't have to continue focus on them.  You know, whatever.  It was a good bit.  We're going to do all this stuff today. 
[00:52:00]  But E-Rock was listening and he ran down the hall with excitement.  I haven't seen E-Rock excited about a CD in a while that he brought in to the studio.  So now we give the show to E-Rock for a second or two here.  So why are you so excited about this audio?  Well, in all your years.  Now that was Sam.  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  I just yawned like a...  Let's bring Sam in and see if he learned his lesson.  Sam.  Sam?  He was right outside the door. 
[00:52:30]  Are you contrite?  Do you know what you did?  I'm sorry for yawning in the middle of the broadcast.  What did you do?  What did you do?  Oh, please hit him.  Oh, no.  I accidentally...  What'd you do?  I accidentally...  Oh, no.  It's got a newspaper rolled up.  What'd you do?  I accidentally yawned.  What did you do?  I yawned while you were explaining your story.  Ow!  No!  No yawning!  Yes, sir.  See this?  Look.  Hit his... 
[00:53:00]  You see that?  No!  Ow.  Bad!  Ow.  No!  And make him put his hand out and hit his hand.  Put your hand out.  Put out your paw.  Okay.  Ow!  No yawning.  You're going to yawn again?  No.  No!  Never!  Never!  Oh, you said no.  Sorry.  Never.  I'll take that back.  Ow!  Sam?  You've got to sometimes, Opie, sometimes these guys, you've got to roll up a newspaper and  let them know what they did.  Let them know what they did.  And I'll tell you this much, Sam.  You yawn again, you're going to get a bare-bottom spanking from Club Soda County. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, my God.  So good luck to you.  I'm going to keep an eye on you, too.  I know you are.  I'm watching.  Mars, you keep an eye on them.  Because I know you enjoy a good bare-bottom spanking.  He said oos.  When you yawn in front of people?  It's going to be.  Oh, Sam.  If you yawn.  Oh, wait.  Sam.  Sam.  I know you yawn.  If you yawn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got a bare-bottom spanking from Club Soda County. 
[00:54:00]  So this is, oh, man.  Oh, my God.  With the 98 Rock in Baltimore.  Yeah.  And, uh...  And Mickey and Amelia Spiegel.  Oh, 98 Rock.  E-Rock, all right.  Back to you.  So, E-Rock, what's the deal?  Throughout the years, I've seen you guys just take on a lot of radio shows, and a lot of  them fight back, and then they just go away.  A lot of them don't...  Because they know they can't fight the battle.  Some of them don't fight back at all. 
[00:54:30]  They don't acknowledge it.  Right.  This is the first time I've ever seen a show actually be divided.  That part of the show is like, you know what?  O and A are right.  Oh, shit.  I told you yesterday we would destroy the chemistry of their show.  And it's already happening?  It's happening.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's not direct, but it's very subtle, and you can pick it up just through points of their  conversation.  So if you listen closely?  Just through points of their conversation, yeah.  Damn.  You know that Mickey was listening to what we had to say yesterday? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, and not listening to the person who's sitting next to him.  See, Mickey, I feel your pain.  Yeah, we understand.  We were lucky.  Management came to us a few times and said, you guys would do very well if you had a woman  to balance out your talk.  We slipped it.  We're like, you know what?  Fuck that.  We'd rather take a chance of just me and Ant and whoever else in the studio, obviously.  We've zigged and zagged through our career and missed the fucking hole.  Yeah, so we just have women on our show to show their whores. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Instead of being holes, they show their whores.  They show the holes.  Yeah, they get it wrong out there.  Women, show their holes on your show.  Yes.  Don't let them be the holes.  All right, so let's get into this audio because E-Rock's like, holy shit.  You got to listen closely?  Yeah.  But you can tell?  It jumps out at you without being very direct.  Is this dopey hole pissed off?  Yeah, she's really annoyed.  All right, here we go.  Oh, no.  Have you heard?  I've had the time of my life. 
[00:56:00]  And I'm dead now.  Yes, I swear.  It's the truth.  I'm dead now.  But I've had the time of my life.  That is horrible.  This is how they started their show.  That was the beginning?  All right.  We started with our Patrick's crazy shit.  Whatever, you know.  Well, come on.  What are you criticizing?  Come on. 
[00:56:30]  Well.  You just get on there.  You're just feeling it.  A little music.  You're kind of off the cuff.  Make some shit up off your head.  Sometimes it's gold.  Sometimes it's not.  That's a setup for the last track, Ant.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Not to tear down a wall, but that's a setup for the last track we're going to play today.  Gotcha.  All right.  It really starts here.  Mike's big day as Mickey plows past the hole.  Yeah.  All right.  Has anybody talked to Mike?  You know, he had a big day yesterday.  Oh, geez.  And another radio show was talking about.  Yeah, they sick their listeners on me, and I got three whole emails. 
[00:57:00]  Well, anyway, the point I'm making, he's so enamored by it.  Yeah.  You know, he's like, he edited it all.  There's all the audio.  Oh, God.  Of those guys talking about us.  And...  Wait, the hole said she got three whole...  She got three whole emails, and he goes, yeah, anyway, at one point I'm trying to make.  Oh, that was the hole.  See, I think...  She's sounding very mannish now.  I'm a dummy, because I think the hole's a gay guy.  It sounds like a guy. 
[00:57:30]  It sounds like a guy.  Maybe a gay guy.  So I can't...  That's a woman?  Distinguish.  She sounds a little butch.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, so that's her way of trying to get to us, that she only got three emails, really?  Yeah, because Mikey just goes, yeah, but that's the point I'm trying to make.  Oh, God.  Did you really get three emails from our listeners?  Come on.  God.  Of those guys...  Yeah.  ...talking about us.  Mm-hmm.  And so it was just hilarious.  He's so freaking...  Went to sleep to it last night, like a lullaby. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's the hole.  That is a manly voice, though.  Yeah, see?  I went to sleep like a lullaby.  Sounds like a tranny.  Yeah.  See, her joke is...  What?  Check this out.  Yeah?  Help me.  We're so boring with our radio show...  Right.  ...that it actually put her to sleep, Anthony.  Oh!  Like Sam yawning.  No.  Nice. 
[00:58:30]  Wow.  That's funny, then.  Instead of putting on a rain CD...  Not that I've done that before, Sam.  Stop looking at me, you fucking freak.  Cool.  Okay?  Um...  She puts our show on it.  Yeah.  And it's like a lullaby.  Like a lullaby.  Well, that's good.  At least she's listening.  Oh, jeez.  Well, if she's gonna listen to this show tonight to go to sleep, let me help her out.  Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt.  You are a cunt.  Oh, good gosh.  Opie, now stop that.  Cunny, cunt, cunt, cunt.  Oh, wait a minute.  Opie, now stop that. 
[00:59:00]  I'm the hole here.  I'm the hole.  So it was just hilarious.  He's so freaking...  Went to sleep to it last night like a lullaby.  Yeah.  He probably did just play it over.  All right.  I see what Iraq is doing.  He's trying to be cool about the whole thing, and she's just trying to do her little jokes  like, aren't you guys with me?  We're supposed to trash these guys.  And he's just like, anyway.  Yeah.  And continue.  That's the equivalent of rolling up your newspaper and smacking her in the face.  Smacking her in the nose.  It's her turn to take shots. 
[00:59:30]  Smack her on the tits.  That's what you do with the females.  Like, I was hitting Sam across his snout.  Yes.  I hit him on his snout.  That's how you do it.  But girls, you smack them in the tits with a rolled up newspaper when they get a little  mouthy.  Cigars and Scotch writes, who knew Chyna was doing morning radio?  Oh.  Sam, you can appreciate a good wrestling line, right?  I love it.  Yeah.  I love it.  Sleeped to it last night like a lullaby.  A lullaby. 
[01:00:00]  He probably did just play it over and over again.  Knowing him, yeah.  I'm trying to think of if I'm a fan of anything that much.  Like, where I would, like, freak out if...  Yeah, your car.  No, no, no.  You spent six months...  And it kind of cut off because everybody was talking over there.  But apparently he was a little pissed because for the last six months all she talked about  was her new car.  Her car.  Anytime they were having other conversations.  That's good.  That's good radio.  Well, that's what a hole brings to the show, B-Rock.  Especially when a hole talks about it.  This is what a hole talks about. 
[01:00:30]  Probably just talking about how badly she's driving it.  Her hole...  The hole talks about her mother, her period, her new car.  How she can't find a good man.  Right.  Oh, God.  All those men out there.  Mickey enjoyed O&A yesterday.  Scott was an O&A fan.  Yeah, but here we are talking about two radio dudes out of New York, and Mike is all about it.  But I get it.  I understand it.  In our field, they're in top five guys. 
[01:01:00]  I mean...  Yeah, that's how Mike feels about it, sure.  I get it.  I get my...  It was funny listening back to Scott yesterday.  He's like, you're such a little bitch.  Did you see?  He was like...  He was quivering at one point.  I know.  You're going to cripple our show.  I'm like, dude...  I mean, I get it.  I told him.  This is a true story.  Yeah.  When I first moved to Albany and started in radio, they were on up there.  There was an FM talk station.  Yeah.  So I would listen to him every afternoon.  I specifically remember the day. 
[01:01:30]  I just...  I was probably 25, 26.  Same exact age as him.  Yeah.  Standing in my bedroom in my house, and I called the Opie and Anthony show.  So I'm a mirror image of this kid.  But it just bugs me, because here I am 10 years later, and I have the hindsight.  I'm like, okay.  Really not a big deal.  They're not going to cripple the show.  But the point is, the things I've learned along the years, it's like when people meet...  I understand when people get excited about that.  Sure.  I don't hold that against Mike.  No.  And I know that this... 
[01:02:00]  I think he blew it a little bit out of proportion.  I don't hold anything against him.  It was just like...  They're not going to cripple the show.  The way he was cowering in fear was a little bit much.  Cowering in fear.  All right.  That's cool.  They're on to us as far as that goes.  They are going to learn firsthand the power of the Opie and Anthony show, because we have  destroyed the chemistry of this show.  ONA harsh on Amelia.  Mickey loved it.  Hole takes a shot.  Uh-oh.  But Amelia, they were so harsh on you. 
[01:02:30]  You know what?  I really don't care.  I know.  What did we learn, Anthony?  We learned.  What did we learn?  All right, Opie, let me think.  Let me think.  We have learned over the years.  And we've been guilty of this ourselves.  So, yes, when you say you don't care, you care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He doesn't care. 
[01:03:00]  But, Amelia, they were so harsh on you.  You know what?  I really don't care.  I know you don't, but I just, I couldn't, I was listening.  They hate women.  They're misogynist.  Or at least that's what they play on.  I got to tell you, though, like, oh, no.  They hate women.  You know what?  They hate women.  Shut it.  You know what?  You dumb bitch.  I'm proving my point.  You're right to a point.  I don't like women on a guy talk show. 
[01:03:30]  We never did.  We don't like women like you that ruin a potentially good program with just guys.  I'm sure there are guys in Baltimore that love just tuning these guys in and go, you know something?  I feel that way.  Or I watched that game.  Or I hung out like that with my friends and stuff.  And then, oh, the hole said something.  Shut up.  Now, and listen to me closely, because, you know, the Howard fans will jump all over this statement, okay?  What?  Howard did a big injustice to radio by hiring Robin. 
[01:04:00]  And hold on.  Hold on.  Before you start your emails.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  It absolutely worked for Howard.  Absolutely.  Oh.  It worked for Howard.  Yeah.  But he is the exception.  Yeah.  The problem is when he hired Robin, but it worked for his show, and this is a mistake most radio shows do, everyone else is trying to follow the formula that Howard had. 
[01:04:30]  So what is it?  You get an edgy jock and you get a woman.  Right.  And then you get your peripheral people.  Right.  And that's the injustice that Howard did to the business, because now we're stuck with all these fucking holes on all these fucking radio shows, yapping, yapping about nothing.  That have been told that their job is to calm the guys down.  Right.  Right.  Oh, don't.  It worked for Howard. 
[01:05:00]  Get in there.  Lead with your clitoris.  Right.  You should just get in there when the guys start talking.  And this is where, because a lot of people like to go, you know, the whole Howard and Opie and Anthony thing, and we're copying this and that, blah, blah, blah.  No, we're not.  See, Howard developed his radio show so it works for him, which meant hiring Robin.  It works.  I'm not going to sit here and say it doesn't, okay?  How could you?  And I said, fuck that.  We're going to do our thing.  Right.  And these radio shows have to do their thing. 
[01:05:30]  Stop following the formula of other successful shows.  Be yourself.  Develop your own thing.  Yeah.  That's the mistake radio has made.  Enough with the holes when guys are hanging around trying to do guy talk.  Enough.  You know when you can bring the hole in?  And that's what I want to address these gentlemen here from this show.  Yeah.  Mickey and such.  You can use a hole maybe after you're like in your mid-50s and you're still on the air and you want to do that husband-wife, that fake husband-wife act because you're a little too old there to do the shocky, edgy stuff. 
[01:06:00]  So you can do the husband-wife, the battle of the sexes game.  Then you bring in the hole and it's fine.  The older folk like it.  But you guys are young guys.  You're, you're, you know, tearing it up a little bit.  You're having some fun.  And you got the brake pedal right there.  That is the, you don't need the brake pedal.  You're all about clutch and gas, my friends. 
[01:06:30]  Clutch and gas.  Clutch and gas.  Get rid of the brake pedal.  And how the fuck are you going to stick your pinky in some, some fucking porn star's, you know, coolly if, if this woman is there?  Well, she's fucking hemming and hawing about the whole thing.  You know she's going to give you that look like, oh, typical man.  Oh, that's disgusting.  Yes, it is.  Now watch me lick my finger.  They, they always got to be like, oh, why are you doing that?  Oh, you don't know where that's been. 
[01:07:00]  Don't shut it.  And then you, you, you lift your finger in the air and go, look at the chlamydia.  It's just glowing off this fucking finger of mine.  And then you go, oh, like cake batter.  You lick it off your finger and it looks like cake batter from the yeast.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  So we don't like women.  Yeah, it is gross.  On the radio.  I finished the statement.  Yes.  On the radio.  On the radio.  Off the air.  When we're not on the radio and, or when a good, nice woman comes in on the air. 
[01:07:30]  You know what?  It's like that.  I got to adjust that though.  I don't like women.  Make an adjustment.  Make an adjustment.  On the radio of shows.  Like that.  Like that.  Like guys just trying to hang out and do their thing.  Yep.  There's a, there's a few shows here on Sirius XM where the women are, are being themselves  and it's good stuff.  Edgy twats.  That's, that's, that's a channel, that's a channel down the hallway.  You haven't tuned in edgy twats yet.  Well, that one show you were talking about, the, the broad vaginas.  Broad minded.  Oh, broad minded. 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  It's a little wordplay for everybody.  Rambunctious Slits comes on after them.  Oh, wow.  Which is just a great show.  They're so rambunctious.  One would imagine.  Steve from Bayshore said, tune into Chatter Cunts, which is right here.  And of course, Goofy is bringing up the great show, Gash Talk.  Gash Talk rules.  Gash Talk is fantastic.  They allow you to stick it in their shitters.  Chatter Cunts. 
[01:08:30]  These are shows that if they don't exist, buy gum they should.  No, the Martha Stewart broads, I listen to every once in a while and I apologize for  calling them broads because, you know, whatever.  They, they deserve a little respect.  I don't know their names.  Alexis and, and what?  Who cares?  What?  I don't know.  Rana Fez had them on.  I've been listening to them off and on when I'm in the car.  Yeah.  And they're, they're not, they're good.  They're just on the wrong channel because Martha Stewart, you think recipes and making, 
[01:09:00]  making stuff out of like twigs and things like that.  Yep.  And then all of a sudden these girls come on in the afternoon and they're, they're doing  some pretty edgy stuff.  Yeah.  They got to switch to a channel like Taint Talk.  Uh, which is just fantastic.  I tune that in all the time when I'm listening to lithium.  My favorite Sirius XM channel?  Yeah.  Deep Gash.  Deep Gash.  Deep Gash rules.  Yeah.  That's good.  It's girls talking a little more in depth about things.  Yeah.  I'm so sick of my penis hitting the back wall, Sam. 
[01:09:30]  Do you have this problem too?  Oh God, yeah.  I don't know.  What do you mean?  And then all of a sudden it's folding inside.  Who needs that?  They talk about that on Deep Gash rules.  Yeah.  What time is it now?  Because get some clips from the Labia Lounge.  That, um, is a fantastic show.  I believe Cigars and Scotch turned me on to that one.  They just sit around with their lips out.  It's great.  Love the image that conjures up. 
[01:10:00]  I'd love to see a logo for Labia Lounge.  Instead of, uh, channels like, you know, the 40s channel, the 50s channel, the 60s channel,  the 70s channel, it should be the teen channel.  The 20s, the 30s.  And we'll go up to 30s.  Yeah.  I don't really go above that.  It's not in my presets.  Hell fucking no.  Why is Labia Lounge an actual website?  Fantastic.  You just can't get away from it.  No.  Wow.  That is amazing.  Let's see.  Can we do a Jocktober whole edition? 
[01:10:30]  Sam is working on Jocktober as we speak.  I can't wait.  That's one of my favorite bits.  Because, you know, I'm a student on this dumb radio thing.  So when Sam brings the stuff.  I think you would have graduated by now.  Yeah.  I'm kind of a, I'll always be a student.  A student.  Well, you never stop learning.  Oh, Sam.  I stopped learning probably 10 years ago.  Oh, but you're doing yourself a disservice.  That's okay, though.  I learned enough.  Yeah.  I learned more than the average person.  Done learning.  Why the fuck do I have to continue learning?  I love the people that are in their, like, 70s and 80s and they're still learning. 
[01:11:00]  Stop it.  What?  You should learn what cemetery is, uh, oh, geez.  Oh, God.  Accepting.  What cemetery is accepting applications?  Which, which cemetery would make it easy for the family?  It's convenient.  You don't have to take flights to see your dead body in the ground somewhere.  Ah, they're learning.  Yeah.  I'm studying for my diploma in mathematics.  What a great inspirational story. 
[01:11:30]  So you can count how many years left you have.  Yeah.  You can do that in one hand.  80 plus one.  Yep.  Well, let me, uh, all right.  So, yeah, we're doing the, uh, we're doing Jocktober and we'll have a hole feature once  again, right, Sam?  Well, I feel like Jocktober is an all hole feature on almost every Jocktober show.  So what, like towards the end, maybe we'll compile the best of holes?  It really makes the best, uh, Jocktober is when there's a hole for us to really lambast. 
[01:12:00]  And are we going to start this lose the hole dot com website?  Yeah, I don't see.  I think we finally have to give it back to radio.  I've been thinking about this lately.  We finally got to give it back.  Yep.  We've taken, taken, taken.  It's time to give back, Opie.  It's time to start planting trees.  You know, when you get back to the community, let's give back.  If you've ever been in the Northwest and you drive one of those highways and you turn the  corner and you see no trees whatsoever, that's what we've done to this business.  Yes.  It's time that we, uh, plant a few, uh, saplings.  I'm going to, uh, pass that info on to you. 
[01:12:30]  Okay.  For the website.  That's a great idea.  Can you, can we start developing that?  I don't see why not.  Especially once Jocktober hits, we can put all the holes up.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  Yeah.  Holes with a little audio clip and pick their favorite holes.  Oh my God.  They can vote on them.  I mean, and the thing is we could, I could bring them in for Jocktober and you guys could  pick your favorite hole clip to go on for the day.  Love it.  Love it.  There's so much that can be done.  Look, Anthony, we, we're talking in general terms because people like Bonnie is funny as  shit.  It's general terms.  Bonnie, uh, Rich Voss's, um, husband is very funny. 
[01:13:00]  Ken in Florida.  We know that.  And Bonnie's very funny on our show.  Yes.  The thing is because she comes in and she's not being a hole.  No, she calls Rich a fucking stupid asshole.  She calls him impotent.  Calls him a fucking woman.  Right.  Says he's unfunny.  She makes fun of his speech, his teeth.  She does everything all of us guys do.  Right.  Except she doesn't have a cock.  As far as I know, I've never seen her pussy, but I assume she doesn't have a cock because  she's pretty. 
[01:13:30]  I think she might have a peener.  Oh, peener.  Yeah.  She has a peener.  Like Lady Gaga.  Uh, oh, wow.  There's another channel on Sirius XM.  Uh, Travis in New Hampshire.  Yes, Travis.  Hey guys, right out of Boston, there's three hilarious witty women.  Uh, it's a show called Lippy Lips.  Lippy Lips.  And the reserve shoot open.  Congrats, dude.  He cut his mane loose and opened the reserve. 
[01:14:00]  We gotta admit something, though.  That was a good line, Travis.  What happens, though, sometimes we just tune out when we say, hi, Travis, you're on the  air.  For real.  Yeah.  Because I'll listen to the replay and go, oh my God, we gave that guy nothing and that  was a good line.  We didn't even help him out.  Because we just tune out.  All right, let's get back to this audio.  So Amelia, I want to harsh on Amelia.  We're going to start this track over because we've been talking for like 15 minutes about  all this shit.  And then the whole attempts, her shots, but Mickey's like trying to push her down because  he heard what we had to say yesterday. 
[01:14:30]  It's like 90210.  But Amelia, they were so harsh on you.  You know what?  I really don't care.  I know you don't, but I just, I couldn't, I was listening.  They hate women.  They're misogynist.  Or at least that's what they play on the radio.  I gotta tell you, though, like.  They really don't like women.  But it was hilarious.  I mean, it's all about how women are assholes and have really no redeeming quality except  for one thing.  So they're doing reality radio.  Yeah, right.  They do reality radio then. 
[01:15:00]  No, but like.  The other thing is you also have to put it in perspective.  There are peers.  They're in the same business to do the same exact thing we're doing.  They're not doing anything that's all that much better.  Trust me.  Yeah.  And they're actually.  All right.  Who's that dick?  That is Scott.  All right.  Scott has to go to Scott has to go to.  I think you got to surround yourself with people that understand what you are trying  to do.  I think he, I think he's, I'm willing to cut him a little slack because I think he's  speaking in general terms.  No, he says, trust me. 
[01:15:30]  What does that mean?  You listen every day, right?  Nothing better than we do.  But I think he means in the fact that like the mechanics of it, I think that, I don't  think he's talking about quality of show or anything like that.  I really honestly think he means the mechanics of this.  We're coming in, we're turning on the mics, we're talking to each other.  You know, that's, that's what I think.  I'm willing to cut him slack.  If he bashes us again, I swear I'll shoot him.  But don't say that.  I'm teasing.  Of course.  Don't say that.  Cause no one knows why we're joking or not.  No, of course you're kidding. 
[01:16:00]  I was just amazed that she got away with saying asshole on terrestrial radio.  Whoa, FCC.  No, I'm kidding.  We weren't allowed to do it.  They never report people.  Because we were on the radar.  I should have learned that lesson when the stupid boss told us.  Should have stayed on the gaydar.  The gaydar.  Get it?  No, I don't.  It's not even a joke.  In perspective, they're our peers.  They're in the same business to do the same exact thing we're doing.  They're not doing anything that's all that much better.  Trust me.  Yeah, and they're actually, they went up and now they're kind of like, meh. 
[01:16:30]  Oh boy.  I mean, I don't, yeah.  Oh boy.  We went up and then we went, meh.  Really?  Wait, wait.  We went up.  That's an insult.  And then we went, meh.  Meh.  Meh.  See?  Meh.  Meh.  Oh, like a dick when you take your clothes off.  All right.  It goes up.  And then they look at you and it goes, meh.  I bet you she's got a lot of experience with the meh part of it.  It goes up.  No.  It goes, meh.  The guy's like, fuck, what was I thinking?  I'm not fucking this ugly dude. 
[01:17:00]  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  I know I had Ted and Jägermeister's, a few fucking lines off the toilet seat.  Meh.  And a bunch of Guinness, but I ain't fucking this broad.  Meh.  Meh.  I mean, come on.  Man.  Yeah.  We had a lot of syndicated markets and they went away and it's all about business.  It's all about the radio business.  Look at everybody.  You know what?  We'll never be able to turn people around on that, but.  That was a moment in radio. 
[01:17:30]  It was a moment in radio history that is just gone.  The era of the syndicated hot talk radio is gone.  It's fucking gone.  Rush Limbaugh, you could get that.  You could get Hannity.  If you have a political talk show.  There's obviously a thing for that.  But sports talk to a point, but that's got to be kept local.  But edgy talk radio, they got so, first of all, they were petrified about fines. 
[01:18:00]  Let me tell this fucking cunt what happened in radio.  I'll school you.  I'll school you, slit.  Here's what happened.  When the FCC jumped on regular radio and put fines from $36,000 to $360,000, whatever it was, around there,  it all of a sudden became impossible for a station or a radio company to pay the amount of fines because it was per occurrence per station. 
[01:18:30]  So it became suicide to put edgy talk radios on 20 stations knowing that they could potentially get fined $360,000 times 20.  So they cut back and started putting local shit shows on.  Why are you yelling?  Loading them up with holes like you.  And that is where we're at right now. 
[01:19:00]  And that's why radio is in the shitter.  Advertising's down.  Ratings stink.  And people are looking at alternatives.  Because that whole era is gone.  It was an era.  It was a time.  It was like pre-cable television.  We lived through it.  It was fantastic.  But times, they did a change.  But the other thing, too, Ant, is they just didn't want to pay us anymore.  Motherfuckers!  Yeah, that was another thing.  Everyone cried poverty because of the economy.  When our contract was up in all these markets, no one wanted to pay anymore. 
[01:19:30]  We didn't have amazing ratings, but we were getting the job done.  And in some markets, we did have amazing ratings, actually.  But Buffalo is a very good example.  We were doing a morning show for Buffalo.  And I'll give you the numbers.  We were making about $75,000.  Now, you've got to hear us out.  The $75,000 is now split with SiriusXM.  Then you've got to pay an agent.  Then you've got to pay our people.  Then Ant and I finally get a little taste of the action. 
[01:20:00]  It's not a lot of money.  Let us wet our beaks.  Right.  So, all of a sudden, they offered $50,000 for a morning show in Buffalo.  Yeah.  And we're like, but we knew the radio business was changing a little bit, so we agreed to that.  Then they dropped that number in half to $25,000.  And we were kicking ass.  We were doing very well.  And that's what we saw time and time again. 
[01:20:30]  But these channels just didn't have the money to pay anymore because the ad dollars weren't where they should be.  And the ad dollars weren't there because, also, a lot of people were just looking at other places.  Radio had become so fucking confined because the FCC – you remember – does anyone remember, maybe, a few years back when every fucking story was the FCC and what they were doing to radio?  How they were dismantling it and threatening people with their livelihoods and fines?  Well, that shit didn't go away.  It's still $360,000 if you say fuck or shit. 
[01:21:00]  But, you know, we continue with this and people are going to go, oh, they're making excuses.  I know.  Yeah, man!  It's 0.0!  I know!  I love the people that think their silly statements like 0.0 get to us.  Shut the fuck up.  Only Mr. Blutarski got a 0.0.  That's right.  And he got two pencils up his nose, so it was still funny.  That's right.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  The pad data simply reads, awful morning show. 
[01:21:30]  Which show are they talking about?  That's not good for us.  That's not good marketing, whoever is doing the pad data.  That's probably not good.  That's funny.  All right.  The hole.  Ah, the hole.  And they're actually, they went up and now they're kind of like, meh.  I mean, you know, there's shows on all across the country.  Yeah, but I mean, they had it all.  And then something went awry.  I mean, I'm not knocking them for, they're still working.  God bless them.  No, we're more than just... 
[01:22:00]  God bless us.  We're still working at least.  We're more than just working, you dumb bitch.  Do you know the industry?  Holy shit.  You know that we take phone calls from the entire country every morning?  Jersey.  And a few...  And a few calls come in from other countries.  No, we're more than just still working.  When it comes down to still working, trust me, you will not hear this voice.  Oh my God.  I'll be gone.  I'll suck it up right till the bitter end.  I'll do appearances at car dealerships.  I will never be the guy that's just still working. 
[01:22:30]  Trust me.  Trust me.  This is still worth doing.  Still working?  And because we lost a lot of those markets, we brought a lot of new people to Sirius XM.  Exactly.  What do you think?  They just went and listened to fucking other shows that sucked ass?  No, they came over here.  She actually has a picture of herself next to a pink motorcycle.  Which one's the hog?  Nice gut. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, shit.  Why would you wear tight jeans if you got an awful body?  She's wearing mom jeans.  She's got a bunch.  And why would you tuck in your shirt to really make sure everyone sees the beer belly?  Yeah, that really is a bit of a gut there.  Ooh, it's got to be a world of hurt when the jeans come off.  I'm just saying.  Any pants or anything?  I mean pants.  Any kids?  In those pants?  Does she have kids?  Or is she faking it?  What's she doing?  Sometimes they fake it like, oh, I have no kids.  I'm fucking 19. 
[01:23:30]  Really?  Here's the final clip.  O&A, we're hilarious.  Hole not happy.  Mickey cuts off the hole.  Just like we said yesterday, we have destroyed the chemistry of this show.  Trust me, we have.  Now the bad data says, awful morning show.  And then in parentheses, not us.  Right.  Thank you.  Could you just put on the pad data, Opie and Anthony hate Sam too?  Oh.  Wait, what?  He was saying?  Just making sure you're paying attention.  Nothing, Sam.  It's okay. 
[01:24:00]  It's all right.  It was just so funny to hear, like, how it evolved.  Like, originally they were all, they thought I went on and trashed them.  Right.  Which I didn't.  But that's their M.O.  They love picking radio fights so that other people talk about them.  But by the end of their show, they liked our show.  Right.  They just went off on Amelia.  Of course.  And I was like, I was like.  See what we did?  And he's laughing his ass.  They liked our show.  They just went off on Amelia. 
[01:24:30]  See what we have done?  Oh, they hate her.  Took an hour to get to this point, but it was worth it, right?  See what we have done?  Fun.  And we don't pick radio fights.  We didn't even know about this show.  They were talking about us.  So we're like, oh, really?  It piqued our interest.  And Iraq then checks it out.  Shows talk about us.  It's brought to our attention.  We listen.  We address it.  And then we move on.  And then if it continues, you know, we continue.  And that's, we get that reputation.  I really want to think about this.  Have we ever started a war out of nowhere, Ant? 
[01:25:00]  For real.  Got the war.  It always started with the other show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We pretty much, we're doing stuff.  We're busy.  Right.  I really don't think we ever started a war just to start a war.  It always was something that was brought to our attention.  For real.  That fat must jiggle on that motorcycle.  You ever see that?  You ever see that?  Let's get back to this because this is great.  I got to hear that last part.  You know what?  Let's just play the whole clip again. 
[01:25:30]  It wastes more time.  Right, Sam?  No.  It's not a waste of time.  It was just so funny to hear, like, how it evolved.  Like, originally they were all, they thought I went on and trashed them.  Right.  Which I didn't.  But that's their MO.  No, but.  They love picking radio fights.  No, but listen.  Other people talk about them.  But by the end of their show, they, like, liked our show.  Right.  They just, they just went off on Amelia.  Of course.  And I was like, I was like, wow.  Like, it was so hilarious at times. 
[01:26:00]  Well, I mean, like I said, that's what they do.  They bash women.  They're a men's locker room show, which, you know, there's definitely a place.  Oh, Mickey.  Mickey, you're so fine.  You're so fine.  Mickey, listen to me.  What she's doing there.  Yeah.  See, you are a locker room show, too.  She just doesn't realize that.  You know you're a locker room show.  Yep.  Oh, that is a mistake on Amelia's part right there.  They're a locker room show.  No, you guys are as well.  But you're holding them back, Amelia. 
[01:26:30]  And that'll become more and more obvious as the days go on.  Now that it's pointed out, it becomes blatantly obvious.  It's like when you buy a car.  Right.  You see that car all over the place.  You go, you know, I never noticed that many of this type of car.  But now it's been pointed out, you own it, you know it.  And they're going to notice now every time she opens her mouth and they go, oh, shit.  What the fuck is that?  Is that her?  That's her.  Is she inbred?  What's going on there?  No, for real, is she?  Why?  That's not confirmed or denied.  I don't know.  Is she one of those people that live in the woods? 
[01:27:00]  No, I think she does this radio show.  What are they called?  The Jackson...  The Jackson...  Whites or something?  Her hair's nice there.  Something like that.  Jackson Brites.  Her hair's nice there?  Well, no, if you like greasy, stringy hair.  All right, I forced that one.  I'm sorry.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Been working on that end.  Have you noticed?  Yes.  Yeah.  This went off on Amelia.  Of course.  And I was like, wow.  It was so hilarious at times. 
[01:27:30]  Well, I mean, like I said, that's what they do.  They bash women.  They're a men's locker room show, which, you know, there's definitely a place for that in  radio.  Isn't that kind of what we're doing?  Well, yeah, except for you guys actually let a woman in, which is kind of refreshing.  Refreshing?  Josh, do you have a song or anything you'd like to take us out with?  I don't know if you...  I know you're a big fan of the music.  I've had the time of my life.  And they went to break.  Oh, wow. 
[01:28:00]  Mickey, you rule.  That had a hurt...  Is she in Amazon?  How big is this fucking girl?  Look at her.  Mickey.  The hot fucking chick next door.  That blonde is really fucking attractive, man.  Why the fuck would you agree to take a picture with two hot broads?  Come here.  Let me take a picture.  Lily, hold the camera, Lily.  Wow.  If that doesn't make a shit sandwich where the bread tastes really good.  Maybe you shouldn't have. 
[01:28:30]  I don't even know what that means.  I just decided to go with it.  Well, there's two very attractive girls next to this giant.  Maybe you shouldn't put something that shows scale next to...  And scale is probably not the right word either.  She is not a petite girl, I think.  No, she's wide, huh?  I'm kind of afraid of her.  Now I'm scared of her.  Did you hear that, though, Ant?  I got to applaud Mickey.  Mickey, you're one of the smart ones in this business.  I'll tell you why.  Because we give our advice every once in a while. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, we like to hold what makes us close to the vest.  So we don't want anybody copying us.  But Mickey, you're a smart one.  We gave you advice, and you're going with it.  He's going with it.  And, yeah, he realizes.  He can't be all in right away.  You'll see.  It'll be more stuff like this.  Like, she was trying to make a point.  And let's back up here.  And he just cut her off pretty much in mid-sentence.  That's what you do to a hold.  Oh, hold on, too.  This is being brought up, and I noticed this, too. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Play back the tape from yesterday.  We don't necessarily have to do that.  But I noticed this, too.  His voice sounds a lot different.  Today?  Today.  Now, I also think he's worked on the voice thing, which is very good.  He sounds more natural, just like a guy hanging out.  He might have the raspy voice to begin with.  That's okay.  Yeah, yeah.  The raspy voice is fine, but you don't have to make it like that.  Yeah, you don't have to.  Almost a singy-songy, deepen it up and articulate every word so it is.  That's right, Anthony.  You just talk.  Fuck it.  You fuck up.  You fuck up. 
[01:30:00]  That's right.  That's right.  That's what you do.  Yeah.  See, anyone could kind of put their voice down on this level.  But he, I think, is sounding a little different.  He's showing the whole who's fucking boss in there.  If she don't want to deal with it, Odensee, get the fuck out.  Take your tits and your vulva and fucking leave.  I like it.  There's definitely a place for that in radio.  Isn't that kind of what we're doing?  Well, yeah, except for you guys actually let a woman in, which is kind of refreshing. 
[01:30:30]  Josh, do you have a song or anything you'd like to take us out with?  I don't know if you're a big fan of the music.  Mickey, bravo.  I've had the time of my life.  Fucking Mickey, bravo.  See, like I said, we played the song to begin this whole thing, and there you go.  Brings it right around.  Brings it right around perfectly.  Another perfect bit by Opie and Anthony.  God damn.  Beautiful.  Can we go home, Sam?  That was a perfect bit.  Sam, it's about time, right?  You guys were great, buddy.  What the fuck?  Derek Jeter gets a night off every once in a while. 
[01:31:00]  We will see you tomorrow.  No.  What?  No, we don't need to go yet.  I thought we would go.  A lot more ground to cover and a lot more of your takes on what's going on in pop culture  and news.  You have Diddy coming in, so.  Diddy's not Eric.  Oh, yeah.  Diddy's coming in.  Eric, you're fanning the flames.  And one more time.  On the barbecue?  I'm sorry.  It's unnecessary.  It's not Goof on Iraq Day.  I take that back.  He loves his food.  It's all right.  We went half an hour.  It's fine.  All right.  And I'm being reminded, John and Buffalo, thank you, John. 
[01:31:30]  How much is Opie charging for his consulting here?  Send them a bill.  Mickey, this is going to cost you, my brother.  Oh, it would be good.  And Kenny's coming to collect, my friend.  But it's going to be worth it.  Look for a big dope.  $1,000.  Look for a big dope to come into your studio.  And that's not your hole.  No.  Because she's big.  And $1,000.  Hold on.  I really don't.  $1,000, though.  A grand?  In cold, hard cash.  Kenny is jumping in his car now, and he's driving to Baltimore. 
[01:32:00]  You gave them advice that in no time at all will pay dividends on that grand.  Honestly, it will.  Yeah.  It will.  You'll see.  And the listeners, you know, call their show and, you know, and just keep pushing the issue  that, you know, that they'd be a much better show without the hole.  And their listeners are going to listen and be like, oh, boy, the hole just said something  that I bet the guys don't appreciate.  So everyone will understand how useless and what an albatross, what an anchor she is to 
[01:32:30]  a potentially very good program.  Yeah.  I mean, these guys seem to have what it takes.  You know what I mean?  She's about a month away from doing noontime blocks.  Yeah, yeah.  Just just I if and if you're management over there and you're listening, you don't have  to get rid of her and break her heart or anything.  Just put her in middays.  You just stick her in middays to do some, you know, rock blocks or whatever the fuck  it is and let the guys be guys.  I like Jorge Posada there on the right.  Who is that? 
[01:33:00]  A little bit.  Posada.  Jesus.  Yeah.  One more time, man, because Mickey learned from us today.  I can't help it.  Mad respect for this Mickey guy.  One more time.  Play it again.  Ashwomen, they're a men's locker room show, which, you know, there's definitely a place  for that in radio.  You know, we kind of that kind of what we're doing.  Well, yeah, except for you guys actually let a woman in, which is kind of refreshing.  Josh, do you have a song or anything you'd like to take us out with?  She's done the dead, the dead air there. 
[01:33:30]  She's done.  That fucking silence, by the way, she's done was brilliant.  She's done.  She's so done.  It's not even a bit like he did it as a bit.  But the funny thing is, most of the people that just heard that on their show have no  idea what the Yopin Anthony controversy is all about.  That is so inside.  The guy learned from us and said, all right, here I go.  This is how I do it.  Impeccable timing.  She's done.  Impeccable timing.  That fucking delay.  Goodbye.  And then let's go to music.  It spoke volume. 
[01:34:00]  He made silence speak volumes.  It's a talent, my friend.  He's done.  She's done.  Sorry.  She's done.  She's done.  Bye-bye.  Kanye West shit next.  Wow.  Pink is angry.  Is she crazy or is she crazy?  She's crazy.  Can't wait to hear her.  And Kanye West crying on Leno.  How great is that for Leno?  Oh, my God.  I can't wait to see the ratings.  He got a little teary-eyed.  Was it when he was talking about his mama?  Yeah.  All that promotion for Leno. 
[01:34:30]  Does it every time.  Fucking mama.  Not in my case.  No.  No.  Not so much?  No.  I haven't talked to her since Christmas.  Oh.  That's your update.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Christmas of...  Holy shit.  It's almost coming back around.  Nine months.  For real.  Kazowie.  Talked to her once since my wedding.  Wow.  And I think I'm...  Wow.  When did I get married?  Jesus.  November.  How long have you been...  Ten months?  Ten months.  Is your fucking anniversary coming up?  I'm up to ten months, my friend. 
[01:35:00]  I only have a couple of months to get you a present.  I gave up.  There's a year.  No.  You're allowed a year.  I gave up on that.  You're allowed a year.  I gave up on that.  I'm looking for something very special.  It hasn't been invented yet.  But it's going to be on the market very soon.  I gave up on that.  It's okay.  No.  No.  I have it in mind.  I know exactly what it is.  It's all right.  I do.  Most of the gifts I got, I've been given to other people anyway.  You're re-wrapping?  Oh.  Like a mother.  Where's the oil painting?  Oh, shit. 
[01:35:30]  Whoa.  Oh, what happened?  Yeah.  Let's get an oil painting up there.  Oh, that face don't look good.  Did it go the way of Amelia?  It's taking up room on a floor.  What, are you using it as a mat?  Maybe I'll tweet that.  I forgot about that bit.  I started tweeting parts of the picture.  Yeah.  This horrible oil painting.  It's not even a horrible painting.  Oh, boy.  But it's something I would never put up in my place.  And I think people can relate to that.  Someone gives you something.  You're like, fuck, now I've got to display this in my house.  Look at my house.  In my house. 
[01:36:00]  I don't want to display this.  And it's always someone that comes over a lot.  So now you're like, pfft.  You worked hard to get the house the way you want it to look.  And then there's this eyesore that someone gives you.  Yeah.  Enough.  My sister gave me a knick-knack thing.  Yeah.  And I'm like, fuck, and she comes over a lot.  I would never put this in my place.  She listens every morning.  Shit.  Oh, shit.  But it came, and it was slightly broken, which I probably could fix with a little glue.  No, you can't display that.  The whole thing was broke.  The whole thing was broken. 
[01:36:30]  I had to tell her.  What am I going to do?  Actually, I didn't tell her, because then she would send another one.  But when she finally discovers that it's not in my apartment, then I'll go, look, it broke.  I didn't know how to tell you.  Yeah.  That's good.  That'll work.  It was a thing.  Is it a knick-knack?  Never.  And there was nowhere to put it?  I will never.  What about a bathroom?  What about the toilet lid?  I will never display a knick-knack in my house.  What about on the toilet lid?  No.  No?  You know what I like?  Candles.  Oh, yeah.  I'm big on scented candles in, like, bathrooms when you have parties and people over. 
[01:37:00]  It's fucking great.  It makes your shit smell like vanilla.  It's wonderful.  Speaking of weddings, did you guilt your sister into inviting me, because I got an invite?  No, she was absolutely going to invite you.  Now it's awkward.  No, she was absolutely going to invite you.  Because out of nowhere, Ant goes, my sister Dawn's getting married in a couple weeks.  I'm like, oh, great.  Thanks for the invite, Dawn.  And we talked about it on the show.  Next thing you know, two days later, I got an invite.  It's really awkward, Ant.  See, two days.  It was already coming out in the mail.  Really?  No, you were absolutely getting invited. 
[01:37:30]  I think I guilted your sister into inviting me and my lovely, lovely wife to her wedding.  Dawn's unguiltable.  Believe me.  I don't know.  Un-fucking-guiltable.  I'm very happy for those two.  Yeah, it'll be a good one.  By the way, also, Patrick has a lot of family in Chicago that aren't going to be able to make it in.  Why?  Because they aren't doing...  She's getting married.  But you know something?  I think they've both been through the mill once.  So they're not doing this giant fucking wedding thing. 
[01:38:00]  It's going to be fun.  It's going to be more a party than a wedding.  So big party at the house.  It's going to be at my house, this whole thing.  But so the people in Chicago can see it, it's going to be streamed on livestream.  What the fuck?  Multi-camera shoot.  What are you doing?  A Bob Kelly?  Going to just stream it.  It's not a bad idea.  It'll be fun.  It'll be a compound wedding.  It's a very special.  Right.  A very special compound.  Tune in.  Sam, what'd you get me for?  It's like my dog, the bounty hunter.  When he walked his fucking niece down the aisle or something. 
[01:38:30]  What'd you get me for my wedding gift?  I don't remember.  Maybe it was just a check for a small amount of money.  Aw.  Really?  That's what we give you every week.  Yeah, I know.  You work for free, basically.  Aw, that's horrible.  Aw.  It's actually negative, because you have to, no public transportation.  Oh, shit.  Did you give me some wine thing?  Oh, that's right.  I gave you a wine rack, because you had said how many bottles of wine you had. 
[01:39:00]  I don't know how to say it.  How about your girlfriend's rack?  That would have been a gift.  That would have been a gift.  It's breasts.  What a gift that is.  She has a gift right there on her chest.  I mean, it is.  That's true.  I'll agree.  Yes.  But I wouldn't give the gift away.  All right.  It's your prerogative.  It's a gift that keeps on giving, though.  Y'all, it is.  Let me tell you.  It is.  What do you mean, let me tell you?  Oh, I mean, it's just my gift.  What's just touching them?  Like, you could touch the girl's arm.  Right.  Or her hand or her shoulder.  What's wrong with just touching?  Well, to me, those are considered private parts. 
[01:39:30]  And now nobody else has...  Private.  Everyone knows they're there.  How private can they be?  Hey, look.  Tits.  It's not like, hey, what's under there?  What are those bumps under there?  That's so private.  I don't know what they are.  They're tits.  But you're not allowed to see them.  Why?  Because they're private parts.  You can know they're there.  I'll give you the vagina.  Right.  It's private.  Vaginas are private.  But tits.  They're tits.  Yeah, but I feel like they're still...  Because, for instance...  Can I touch them?  No. 
[01:40:00]  I just thought I'd throw that in while you were...  Because it'd be R-rated.  You can't show...  Really?  You can't show a breast in a PG-13 movie.  I think you can.  I don't think so.  No?  I don't think so.  This thing in age.  I hope not.  All right.  I tried.  Sorry.  So...  It's okay.  Anytime you decide okay, let me know first.  Oh, I will keep you in mind.  Thank you.  This wine rack thing...  Do I have it in my house?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Oh, god damn.  That's so...  Has he been over and he's just like...  My wine rack's not here.  Well, I mean... 
[01:40:30]  Have you seen the wine rack?  Oh, hell no.  No, definitely not.  I mean, I've been...  I've checked all the rooms.  See, Sam's my Danny and E-Rock's my Travis.  Boom.  Ah!  Face to you, E-Rock.  Oh, damn.  There's a major divide within the show itself.  Why are you pointing and laughing at me, Aaron?  Yeah, really?  Wait a minute.  It's true.  What do you mean, ha-ha?  He's saying, ha-ha, Travis, you're me.  Ha-ha, Travis, you're me.  What is the...  Ha-ha, ha-ha. 
[01:41:00]  But me and, uh, Travis are on the edge of becoming friends finally after five years.  Really?  Who's gonna get pushed out, though?  Yeah, I know.  Someone's gotta go.  Yeah, you know.  Oh, boy.  Who doesn't hang out with anybody?  Steve.  Steve.  Ha-ha, that's true.  Steve.  D-Boy.  E-Rock, what did you get me from my...  No, D-Boy's been over my house.  D-Boy came over my house once.  Uh, he drove from Jersey.  Now, everybody that listens to the show, never mind people that work for the show, knows 
[01:41:30]  I have kegs in my house.  Uh, I also have bottled beer, whatever.  He comes to the house with a case...  No, a cardboard case with, like, two six-packs in it, and the rest filled with ice that was  just dripping through the bottom of the cardboard box.  He's a party animal.  He can.  He just puts it down next to the fucking table and starts cracking them one after the  other.  Did he just come from the beach?  No, I don't know where he was, but it was a long drive.  Uh, D-Boy is a party fucking nut. 
[01:42:00]  Was his surfboard on top of the car?  Oh, I wish I would look out front.  He's got a roof rack.  I didn't see that, does he?  Yeah, just the surfboard.  Travis comes over.  I like that.  Actually, I don't know if the whole Travis family is coming over the house today.  Is that true, Travis?  What?  No, I think it's the entire family, but me.  You're not, uh, you won't be attending?  No, I don't think so.  So the wife and the young child?  Yeah.  What is that about?  That's coming over.  Why are you having a wife and a young child over your house?  Because it's going to be a nice day and the pool's heated again and, uh, I cranked the  heat up.  I cleaned it out.  Other people are coming over, I think. 
[01:42:30]  If you want to come over, feel free.  Yeah, exactly.  You've got an open invite.  Then you realize you forgot to invite me, so now live on the air, it's another awkward  moment.  Obviously, the invite went out yesterday.  I actually didn't invite anybody.  You invited Travis's wife.  No, no, Tralisa will just invite herself.  That's what she does.  Well, she talks to her friend.  She texts me.  She goes, swimming tomorrow?  And I'm like, ah, what do I got?  I got to say yes.  And she's friends with Ange, who is going to be at the house.  I will come over when I really feel like the invite is genuine, okay?  The invite is genuine. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Come over.  This is probably going to be the last, like, nice day in quite a while.  It's going to rain.  It's going to be like fucking 80 degrees.  The pool, I had the heater cranking for two days now because it's been cold.  Had my little robot going around getting all the leaves out.  So it's going to be fun.  I'm going to go home today right in the fucking pool.  I got a golf lesson with Boris, okay?  Boris is a golf pro?  Fuck yeah, he's a golf pro.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's a golf pro.  Really good?  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  He's a better teacher.  Oh, yeah?  He doesn't want to hear that.  No, he's good.  God damn, that's an insult.  Oh, those that do, do, those that can't teach.  No, Boris is all right.  I think he's, what is his, uh, what is his Twitter name?  B-Golf or something like that?  Yeah, B-E-E.  B-E-E Golf.  Oh, my God.  He looks like a scholar.  That's not Boris.  Is that the first Boris that popped up?  Yeah, Google image Boris.  You asshole.  I'm looking at going, that does not look like a golf guy.  Boy, you're just like Danny.  That's Boris. 
[01:44:00]  Where's Danny today?  Danny would have had some chick golfing with big kids.  Right.  Yeah.  And like pierced clitoris.  Remember that time I found that?  With a prolapsed asshole.  I found that donkey for rent.  Danny would have never found the picture of that donkey for rent.  That is true.  Yeah.  Danny has a lot of sexual content on the screen at all times.  There.  All right.  See, that's good.  There you go.  Ah.  Let's take a break, Ant.  That's good.  This fucking McDonald's.  Are they advertisers?  Actually, it's not even, it's not even, I'm not. 
[01:44:30]  Speaking of Boris, D-Boy was in here.  D-Boy.  Hang tight.  D-Boy, you did great.  I liked how you brought over the beers.  That was very fun.  I was just commenting on it.  Really no need to take you away from your duties.  And he just giggles and walks away.  He's just not made to be on the radio live.  I don't know how to do this.  He's a genius, but on the air, he stinks on ice.  His recording abilities is second to none.  He's really good.  And his drinking abilities, people don't understand this, better than me, better than Danny. 
[01:45:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  That motherfucker can drink like no one I've seen.  What is he hiding?  Yeah.  Oh, this pain.  There is so much pain.  How much pain does D-Boy have?  Oh, pain.  Now, I just said this fucking McDonald's.  I don't mean that, because I enjoy a good McDonald's meal every once in a while, but there's a certain  McDonald's where a 50-year-old, no, no, not a 50-year-old, a 68-year-old has been working  there for 50 years.  Jesus.  Wait till you hear what they gave this guy for 50 years of service. 
[01:45:30]  So I'm not yelling at McDonald's.  I'm basically yelling at this owner of this particular McDonald's.  It's unbelievable.  50 years.  50 years, and he's 61?  68.  Oh, 68.  Okay, 18.  Started at 18.  Well, we'll explain that next, and the Kanye West thing continues.  Where's my sandwich?  We got him crying on Leno.  No, it's really good.  Stick around.  I'm sure you heard the audio, but not with our comments.  Of course.  That's the beauty of us.  That's true.  That's the beauty of us.  Brilliant.  That's what's so good about this show is not the pop culture, but your take on it. 
[01:46:00]  Shut the fuck up.  I guess we just go to break, then.  You got something to take us out with?  Oh, Travis.  Shut up and let me jump.  Hey.  Shut up and let me jump.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Opie and Anthony.  Patrice O'Neal.  Good morning.  I teased this before the break. 
[01:46:30]  It's a quickie, but I just got to acknowledge something here.  Man honored for 50 years of service at McDonald's.  McDonald's.  Oh, I took a guess.  This scumbag that owns this fucking restaurant.  What a piece of shit.  Why?  I'll tell you why.  A 68-year-old man who still works.  Filet-o-fish sandwich.  Who still works at the first McDonald's restaurant in Missouri has been honored for 50 years of service.  This guy, Leonard Romberg, began his job at a McDonald's restaurant in the St. Louis suburb of Crestwood in 1959, the year after it opened, and he still works there five days a week. 
[01:47:00]  He's 68 years old.  Is he his lease assistant manager?  Did they give him a key to the freezer?  I need to know more.  You're assistant to the assistant manager of McDonald's.  Isn't this great?  The story only has one more line, but it's unbelievable.  KSDK-TV reports that the restaurant's owner, Patrick and Tom Hillmeyer, thanked Romberg for his 50 years of service on Wednesday with a cake, gifts, and a St. Louis Cardinal's jersey. 
[01:47:30]  That's for 50 fucking years.  And the gifts, if they were real gifts, they would be listed like a new car, this, that.  It just says gifts.  So it's shitty little...  Can we call them?  Knick-knacks.  Yeah, let's call them.  A guy works for you for 50 years.  Yeah, could we please call us McDonald's for a second?  I want to hear that.  It bothers you, right?  I don't even know this guy. 
[01:48:00]  Is this guy still on fries?  You know what?  Does he have carpal tunnel syndrome when he's trying to...  Now, obviously, the call's got to be made.  Look, look, the call's got to be made smart, and I hope people can do this.  You've got to make the call to the guys that, wow, we heard the story.  It's very interesting.  Oh, yes, yes.  50 years, blah, blah, blah.  So that's how...  Don't call and go, we want to realize...  We want to know why you're such scumbags, so could you come on the air with us?  Be smart.  You're saying that Steve kind of ruins it a little bit? 
[01:48:30]  They have to know they're on the air.  They're going on a radio show, but they don't have to know that, you know, we're pretty much  just going to drill them.  Yeah, the information.  Hello.  The information.  Yes.  Yeah, so let's try to get...  We've got to get this guy in line.  What the...  50 years?  And you just gave him shitty stuff.  A cake, gifts means, you know...  He's in there right now making a McSausage sandwich.  Right now.  Making breakfast for somebody.  With his knuckles.  He probably has some old man knuckles that are just...  His right...  His index finger is probably bent to the left. 
[01:49:00]  He's got arthritis.  Fucking old bastard.  And there he is.  There's no loyalty anymore, and you wonder why.  The guy gave you 50 years, and he gave him a shitty fucking St. Louis Cardinals jersey  and a cake.  Is this the news story?  He worked there before the M.  Hold on.  How was that?  Home to the only...  Do you know, it's...  The Golden Arches...  It was the Arch.  It was just the Arch?  They weren't M's. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, you always want to fucking...  So you're saying it was an N.  All right, we get it.  You invented McDonald's.  Holy shit.  Nah, niggamania.com will dispel that.  It was just Arches.  Nah.  I'm telling you.  It wasn't a M the whole time.  You're trying to say the Arches is really just a lazy N.  It was.  Oh, stop.  Stop.  Now, it was...  Now, I didn't know this. 
[01:50:00]  I thought it was an M for McDonald's.  In Philly, they got...  In a few places, they got the original way it used to look.  And that's...  An M is a golden M.  That's not a golden arch.  It's like...  You know?  The golden arches used to be arches.  That's true.  What was the...  What was the thought behind golden arches?  They were dumb until fucking...  Because those two...  Did you see the history of McDonald's?  The fucking idiots that created McDonald's... 
[01:50:30]  Ray Kroc?  Ray Kroc pimped them out of McDonald's.  Get the fuck out of here, really?  He...  No, okay.  The original McDonald's people...  Yeah.  They get money.  Yeah.  But Ray Kroc invented franchise.  Franchising the thing out.  And he franchised McDonald's.  And Ray Kroc, that cocksucker, because he started out selling the milkshake machines to  all the places.  Then he got to Ray Kroc, and he's like...  Because the brothers, their innovation, the original McDonald's guys, their innovation was 
[01:51:00]  cook burgers a lot of burgers now.  But, like, as opposed to, okay, order, and then I'll make you a big burger.  They invented, like, fucking hurry up and take your burger right this second.  Now get the fuck out.  And then Ray's like, holy shit.  Fast food.  And Kroc took over.  But I think the descendants of those two assholes that fucking end up selling the fucking...  They don't have shit.  They sold it to Kroc, that fucking...  Those idiots.  The McDougal brothers. 
[01:51:30]  The McDougal.  And now Ray Kroc is...  People know him for that.  But he changed it to the M.  Like, he's the motherfucker that did this shit.  Oh.  He's like, why would this be called McDonald's and there's only half an M?  And this motherfucker, you know...  I didn't know that.  Now we know, right?  Now we know...  You know something?  Educational fucking programming we do on a daily basis.  Oh, History Channel's great.  This is channel fucking 13.  This is fucking public television.  But he was there day one, this guy. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Fucking...  So this is amazing that they would play him out like this, man.  How does Ray Kroc, like, see that shit?  Like, how does Ray Kroc look and go, I could make a fortune on this?  Oh, you know what he made all his money on before?  What?  Ray Kroc was a hustler.  He was a pimp.  He made all his money from selling cups to restaurants.  He just sold cups.  You need cups, nigga?  What, paper cups?  He went out and garnered...  Is that how he did it?  He went out and garnered the cups.  Oh, man, I got some cups for you. 
[01:52:30]  Nigga, wait.  I got cups, nigga.  I got some cups and shit.  What the fuck?  Your people don't drink?  Well, yes, they do.  Well, I got cups, nigga.  Buy your cups for me.  Ray Kroc.  Or else.  Or else, nigga.  You know me.  I'm the Kroc some fucking New Jersey, nigga.  So, and he fucking, then he, this motherfucker, he saw they sold milkshake things, but then  he said, hold the fuck up.  He ended up getting one that makes five milkshakes. 
[01:53:00]  He saw the fat boom.  He saw motherfuckers, I want a lot of milkshakes now.  Now, before this, I guess you'd go to, like, the drugstore and say, hey, give me a  burger, Pete.  Yep.  And I'll have a milkshake.  And he goes, okay.  And does that.  Makes the milkshake.  It takes a long time.  He's cooking the burger.  Yep.  And then this guy decides, you know what?  We could fucking make all this shit in quantity.  Well, with the milkshake machines.  And people wait on line. 
[01:53:30]  The McDonald's brothers, I forgot their actual names.  They, the ones that said, they was selling so many burgers that they got the big ass grill  to make a lot of burgers quick.  Yeah.  And, and Croc saw something in that.  He said, damn.  Damn, damn, damn.  See, that's an insightful gentleman, though, being able to see that.  We all watch how it's made.  Yeah.  But I didn't see that one.  Yeah.  You missed the McDonald's one.  I didn't see that one.  Nigga, tell me.  I like to know the motherfucker that invented the fish stick.  That shit amazes me. 
[01:54:00]  It amazes me.  But then you Google it and you go, what the fuck?  Well, let's get back to this guy.  He gave 50 years of service.  Yeah, 50.  Let's see.  Someone else saying the arch is because it's from St. Louis, but.  What?  McDonald's started in St. Louis and maybe they're just doing the.  The arch?  The arch from.  It wasn't the M.  Right.  Okay.  Here's the story of the guy giving 50 fucking years and he gets a cake, gifts.  When it's listed as gifts, you know, they're shitty things. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Now, now.  And a jersey.  What's your idea on how, if they're going to take this angle, like.  They're going to.  Go sport.  This is a wonderful.  This is a feel good story.  After they just did a half hour on all the blood and mayhem in their city.  They always have to end the newscast with a feel good story.  And here's today's.  Man to have worked there nonstop for the past 50 years.  Fox News John Avel has today's golden anniversary under the golden arches.  Leonard, you've got to be pretty proud of what you. 
[01:55:00]  I am.  I am.  In fact, he's loving it.  68-year-old Leonard Romberg.  All right.  Stop it.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  Who's that guy?  How long has he been there?  It looks like he's getting a cake.  Let's see.  He's loving this.  68-year-old.  68-year-old.  He's been working here for 18 years.  Before there was.  And his bad hip.  I remember when there was a whites-only bathroom up in this bitch. 
[01:55:30]  Leonard.  Can you back up a little?  He probably does, though.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  Oh, my God.  68-year-old Leonard Romberg started working at the same McDonald's when he was 18 and just  out of Afton High School.  I'm sorry.  Is Leonard doing his own?  It's his own story.  Leonard, me, has been working at the same McDonald's. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, this dolt.  At the same McDonald's when he was 18 and just out of Afton High School.  Now he's been there longer than it takes one to say two all-beef patties, special sauce,  lettuce, cheese, pickled onion on a sesame seed bone.  Back when I started, there were 15 cents hamburgers.  And gradually got more and more and more. 
[01:56:30]  And they got better and better and better, I was told to say.  Yeah, well, I'm...  The Hillmire family.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Stop.  Stop the table.  I got this figured out.  This is horrendous.  Now I know why they didn't give him anything good.  This is horrendous.  Why?  He's fucking retarded.  No.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  It said McDonald's busboy.  He's 50 years.  He's been cleaning up fucking trays.  The guy should be head of the fucking company.  Wait, in 50 years, they don't even allow him to make the stupid french fries?  No.  How hard is that?  He walks around cleaning the trays up. 
[01:57:00]  This guy is fucking like Bill.  You ever see the movie Bill with fucking Mickey Rooney?  I'm making coffee at the wild-built coffee shop.  Oh, boy.  And he's a fucking retarded guy.  They drag him out of an institution and realize that he wasn't really retarded, but they institutionalized  him when he was a kid.  How hard can you be a diligent servant for 50 years and be retarded?  Because all he's got to do is clean up the fucking trays and dump them out.  Yeah, he's not distracted by thinking about pussy and reading and shit. 
[01:57:30]  He came with the fucking store.  Every time that store changed hands, he was part of the property.  Just like the fucking shake machine, the fridge, the fucking grill, and the retard.  Because no one wanted to be the guy to fire him.  No.  You'd be a prick.  Yeah.  And he probably makes nothing.  The community would be outraged.  He makes nothing.  And he looks a little off.  Let's see.  Maybe it's just old age, though.  No.  That guy's fucking retarded.  Leonard is a dolt.  Maybe his arteries are clogged.  Leonard is a dope.  More and more and more and more. 
[01:58:00]  Something got better and better and better.  I was told this way.  Yeah, well, I...  Rewind that.  Rewind that to the first more.  You don't see...  If you're not retarded, you don't say more and more this many times.  Listen.  Listen.  Wait, wait, wait.  Don't wait.  Before you play it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Before you play it.  Before you play it.  And he tried to get him another more in at the end.  So you've got to be saying that the reporter is retarded, too, because instinctively  you would not say the entire two old beef patties special sauce. 
[01:58:30]  Exactly.  All you have to do is go, but faster than you can say, two old beef patties.  That motherfucker said the whole thing.  Patrice, I got a theory on that, too.  You know how they send the Asian to the Asian stories?  The black guy to the black stories?  The white guy to the white stories?  They sent a retard to the retard stories.  Leonard is an idiot.  Wait, wait.  Some are saying that two old beef patties thing is a Burger King.  No.  No, that's Big Mac.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.  Special sauce line?  Yeah, special sauce.  A fucker. 
[01:59:00]  It's ketchup and...  All right.  All right.  I thought I meant something.  It's delicious and mayonnaise.  Burger King has the Whopper.  No, it's Russian.  Russian dressing.  And I'm getting something from Steve.  We're going to get...  Who are we getting on?  Leonard.  Which one's Leonard?  He's the guy.  He's the guy.  Oh, and...  Holy shit.  Fantastic.  Oh, my God.  This could be one of our better bits.  Oh, no.  Steve writes, Steve writes, talk super loud.  He's deaf.  Oh, no.  Radio gold coming up.  All right.  All right.  Strap in. 
[01:59:30]  Strap in.  Wait, wait.  We got to do the rest of the story first.  Hold on.  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's do the rest of the story.  There was another observation.  The 50 years of service.  So they're going to throw him a little party?  Yeah.  They don't even fucking close the McDonald's for an afternoon.  Oh, my God.  His family shows up with three shitty balloons.  They had it in the back with the kids' slides.  Look, there's people eating, and it's like Leonard's big day.  They had it, and it didn't even close the fucking McDonald's.  Here we go.  Watch us. 
[02:00:00]  The shitty balloons.  Listen.  More and more.  And Bradley got more and more and more.  And more.  And they got better and better and better.  I was told this way.  Yeah, well, I...  That sounds like an old man.  It doesn't sound retarded to me.  No, it sounds like an old retarded, man.  If you saw this movie, Bill, he sounds just like Bill.  You're convinced he's retarded.  He sounds just like Bill.  He's not like, you know, mongoloid retarded or anything.  He's just fucking...  He's one of those guys that probably was a little slow.  And then he learned this... 
[02:00:30]  How to dump out fucking trays.  And let's be honest here.  Mm-hmm.  15.  Okay.  He started at 18.  Okay.  18.  18 years old.  50 fucking years.  But that's not retarded.  He's an 18-year-old boy who starts at McDonald's.  That's not retarded.  Like, a retarded boy who starts at McDonald's is 28.  It's a different time, Patrice.  I think he's retarded.  We'll know soon.  You see the shitty balloons?  Yeah.  Four fuck...  Two yellow balloons and two red balloons. 
[02:01:00]  Continue.  Because we've got to get Leonard on this one.  The Hillmeyer family, who has owned the restaurant for nearly 50 years, threw Leonard a party.  People came by to shake his hand.  No, they came by for a lot.  He would serve a commemorative cake.  And he had his picture taken.  Let's give him a round of applause.  Wow.  50 years, you get your picture taken.  The Hillmeyer still calls himself the clean-up man.  Clean-up.  He was given a shirt sharing the number 50 with Cardinal pitcher Adam Wainwright.  The shirt doesn't fit.  And he munched on an Angus burger as we spoke during a... 
[02:01:30]  I paused this.  I paused this.  After 50 years, they give him a fucking burger.  Because he's retarded.  He wants anything but a burger.  He loves it.  Give him a pinwheel.  He'll fucking smile.  He's retarded.  I'm fucking banking this guy's retarded.  And right now, this guy...  This is a sit-down interview.  They're sitting down.  He's got the burger.  You listen to him.  Now, I haven't heard this.  I'm putting myself out on a limb here.  I haven't heard this.  But I don't think the theory of relativity is coming out of this motherfucker's mouth right now when they talk to him. 
[02:02:00]  He's going to be eating a burger and babbling like an idiot.  And he's taking little retarded nibbles.  Yeah, look.  Looks like a rat's been eating his burger.  Fucking bitch.  It ain't even big, juicy, delicious bites.  He doesn't even need the special sauce.  He makes his own.  Drooly, nibbly, retarded burger.  Oh, no.  Leonard makes his own special sauce. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, we got to play Ding Fries Are Done for Leonard's big day.  That's what we do.  There you go.  Continue.  Thank you, Pat.  As we spoke during a quick lunch break before he got back to his cleaning duty.  Pause again.  He might get fired.  Pause.  They're going to make him work.  Thank you.  This is how this whole thing started.  I mean, you know, we're beating up Leonard a little bit.  But the owner of this place, fuck you.  The owner's a douche.  Letting him have a quick lunch with a reporter.  Hurry up and eat. 
[02:03:00]  Give him the fucking day off.  We got to talk to the owner.  I bet you he knows people.  He doesn't want to talk to anybody, the owner, because he just knows people like, you douche.  The owner's fucking Bill Cox.  He's a douche.  I worked down at Bill Cox's McDonald's.  I keep me in the room out back.  He bought me some hard candy and magazines.  He's fucking Sling Blade.  That's what this kid is.  Not really retarded, but so fucked up as a kid that he's now working at Bill Cox's McDonald's.  Amazing.  I think now I'm coming around.  I think I'm seeing it. 
[02:03:30]  Let's continue.  What you got good to eat in there?  You're right.  I think he's retarded.  I think I get reloaded.  Oh, what happened, Sam?  This is not my fault.  It's him.  Fashion to fashion.  Oh, no.  Sesame seed bun.  No, we did that part.  Early 50.  No, we did that part.  No, not the cake.  No, we did it.  No.  No, we did the cake.  Oh, we did the cake.  A round of applause.  Right there.  Rack bites on the burger.  He smoked during a quick lunch break before he got back to his cleaning duties. 
[02:04:00]  We've been his life, I think.  I mean, he's a single man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  He loves doing that, and he's here every day.  And he can go as long as he can get in there.  Well, I'm not going to fire him.  The only downside Leonard can think of is that the restaurant's smell often gets into  his clothes.  Did you hear how benevolent the owner is?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, he's a single man.  Retard.  Retard.  Come on. 
[02:04:30]  Who ain't fucking calling this?  But retards deserve a little loving, too.  This fucking owner sucks.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm not making a commentary on the dolt.  It sucks.  I'm just saying he is, in fact, the dolt.  The owner's like, oh, fuck.  Everyone noticed that we've been working this guy.  By the way, he was the former owner.  Oh.  That guy was the former owner.  We won't fire him.  Yeah.  No one's going to fire him.  We're going to let him work until he just drops, he falls right in the old mop water bucket.  And then we won't even get rid of him.  We'll put him in the freezer with the hash browns. 
[02:05:00]  He'll be fucking there.  And we'll say hi.  And then we'll stuff him.  We'll send him to the taxidermist.  Have fucking Norman Bates, whoever, stuff him.  And he'll be in front of the McDonald's like big boy.  That's amazing.  You know what a sad thing was, too?  The brand new Cardinals jersey they gave him was all stained.  He got food on.  He got food stains.  Because he's fucking a retard.  I think after 50 years, you would know how to eat a McDonald's burger without getting something on it.  He got it all over.  And he took those little bites and he still got shit on himself.  What? 
[02:05:30]  They're not little bites.  They're what, Patrice?  Retard nibbles.  Retard nibbles.  Retarded nibbles.  Well, someone's going to take that name.  God damn, man.  I love when a new name is invented on this show.  Oh, retard nibbles.  Today's name was Pot Roast Muscle.  Someone grabbed that one.  And now, retard nibbles is going to be a new name.  All right.  Let's continue here.  Especially a dog.  John Arbel, Fox 2 News.  Wait.  What did he say?  A room.  Especially into his clothes. 
[02:06:00]  So people will know you work at McDonald's when you come into a room.  Especially a dog.  John Arbel, Fox 2 News.  Oh.  He's winning.  Let me put this in perspective.  When Leonard started there, there were only 71 McDonald's in the entire world.  Oh, my goodness.  Now there are some 34,000 of them and counting.  But none of them have a more dedicated employee than Len and Robert.  They didn't even give him.  That's amazing.  50 years anywhere at a job is amazing.  That is dedicated.  Why don't you acknowledge that the guy, the owner didn't do the right thing for Leonard? 
[02:06:30]  But not even the owner.  He's dumb newsreaders.  McDonald's.  Yeah, yeah.  They should have said, hey, listen, you part of the first 70 friends.  Even before that, he was there before even that.  Hey, this is what I'm going to do.  We're going to give you some type of package where you get a dime for every burger we sell.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And this guy would be a zillionaire and we made it.  He's going to eat the dimes.  He's going to eat the dimes.  He's going to eat the dimes. 
[02:07:00]  They'll find him with a fucking abdomen full of dimes in a few years.  Have to take him to surgery.  What did you do with the dimes?  I ate them.  Oh, no.  They were good.  You've got to give this restaurant shit.  They didn't even give the day off after 50 years.  What's he going to do on a day off?  He's a fucking retarder.  Put him on a fucking first wheel or something.  Let me tell you something.  He's still alive because he works there.  He's still alive because he works there.  He got lucky.  How many vacations did he get?  Let's get Leonard on the phone.  You've got to call Leonard.  You've got to call him.  Remember, he's deaf, so you've got to talk real loud, not just loud. 
[02:07:30]  Hi, Leonard.  Like that.  Yeah.  It says can't be completed as dialed.  Didn't they get just called fucking 411-ing Leonard's McDonald's.  I'm making sure that our retard gave us the right number.  Oh!  Maybe it's the number for Corey from Australia.  I've worked here for 50 years. 
[02:08:00]  The dumb newsreaders, too.  Oh, good God.  50 years of anything.  Oh, my goodness.  Nothing human about him.  No.  All right.  What are we doing, Travis?  So we're not going to get him?  Well, we're going to keep trying.  That's the number that...  But didn't Steve talk to him?  Yeah, he did.  So, I mean, maybe...  What is it?  Murray Hill 7-6503.  It's very possible, dude.  You have to call him with the thing that you just tap until you get a...  Click, click, click.  Hello, Sarah?  Get me Leonard.  Yes, Leonard from McDonald's.  Hold on, please. 
[02:08:30]  Number, please.  Number, please.  One ringy day.  Hello?  He talks into that shot glass on his fucking cord.  Puts the shot glass on a cord next to his ear and talks into the little cup.  Hello.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Leonard here.  The tap.  Oh, Jesus.  Number, please.  Please.  He's retarded.  Operator.  Our commander-in-chief says it's the right number, but it can't be completed as dialed. 
[02:09:00]  It's ringing now.  Oh, it's ringing?  I think the problem might be is that he probably has a very old...  He doesn't have call waiting, I bet.  This is Leonard's number?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Talk to him.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Oh, fantastic.  I can hear this.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Hang on.  Hang on.  He's coming.  He's coming to the phone. 
[02:09:30]  I think I heard Butch.  Hello, Leonard?  Oh, okay.  Hi.  Can you go on the air?  Hang on one second, okay?  Okay, you guys.  Here we go.  Hang on.  Here we go.  Hi, Leonard.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Hi, Leonard.  Congratulations on 50 years of service at McDonald's.  On what?  Congratulations on 50 years of service at McDonald's. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you.  That's fantastic.  We saw the news story.  Did you?  Yes.  And you've been there in the same store for 50 years?  50 years!  That's right.  That's right.  Fantastic.  How many days have you taken off?  Have you ever taken a vacation?  Oh, yeah.  I get vacations.  Really?  Yeah.  What do you do on vacation, Leonard?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing?  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  What do you work for the Opie and Anthony show?  The first black man was in McDonald's.  Yes.  Oh.  Leonard, do you remember, what year was the first Negro allowed in McDonald's?  Oh, I don't know.  No?  I don't know.  Was it during the time you were there?  Probably, right?  I would imagine.  Yeah, I would think so.  Before that.  I don't know.  Hey, Leonard, do you like those people?  Do I like what? 
[02:11:00]  Leonard.  Yeah.  Do you eat McDonald's every day?  Well, not every day.  No?  Most of the time, no, I do.  A lot of times.  Do you get it for free?  If I'm working.  Oh, they don't give it to you for free if you're not working?  Uh-uh.  Leonard, what did your scumbag owners get you for 50 years of service?  What kind of gifts did you get? 
[02:11:30]  What kind of what?  Gifts.  Well, I got some gift certificates, that's all.  That's it?  For 50 years?  Told you.  The shitty gifts.  Yeah.  Gift certificates for what, Leonard?  For being here 50 years.  No, what were the gift certificates for?  Yeah, what can you get with them?  Right.  Uh, food?  But you work at a McDonald's.  Leonard, do you remember?  Ask him, was he happy with the gifts, man? 
[02:12:00]  Do you remember when the bathroom said white and colored?  No.  Oh.  Heard that one.  Just asking, a little history.  Was he, did he deserve, did you think he deserved more gifts?  Patrice, yell at him.  Leonard?  Yes.  Do you, were you, were you satisfied with those, with, with, what you got for your 50  years of service?  Well, I was satisfied.  Did you, did you think you, he's not satisfied.  Now, let me ask you a question, Leonard. 
[02:12:30]  Have you ever gone for a promotion?  No.  Why?  You're only a bus, I didn't, I didn't want to.  Why?  I just didn't want to.  Did they ever offer you a better position at, at McDonald's?  Yeah, I was offered twice.  What was the better position?  Uh, being a manager.  A manager?  And you said, and you said, no, why, Leonard?  Yeah, why would you say no to that?  Isn't it more money?  Not that much.  So, more aggravation, but not that much more money. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Now, if they had to paid you maybe triple what you're making now, you might consider it?  Well, it could be, maybe.  Are you working now, Leonard?  Yes, I am.  Oh, you're working right now?  That's right.  Is your boss there?  Uh, yeah.  Can we please speak with your boss?  You want to talk to my manager?  We would love to.  Oh, is it a hole? 
[02:13:30]  247.  Damn, Seth.  Damn, that's cheap.  Did I hear 247?  Hello?  Hi, is the manager there?  I'm a manager.  What?  Susan, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're very excited about Leonard and his 50 years of service, and we figured we would talk about him today.  Okay.  Ah, now he's been there 50 years.  How long have you been working as his boss? 
[02:14:00]  22 years.  22 years.  So, about half of his tenure there has been under you, your leadership.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  So, you've been covering for his mistakes for the last 22 years?  Yeah.  Now, did you have anything to do with the planning of this party that made the news?  I know our owner did it.  Oh, the owner did it.  Oh, are you a little taken aback by the fact that he's been there 50 years and really didn't get that much? 
[02:14:30]  I'm sorry.  My phone was beeping in when you were talking.  All right.  Well, do you think he didn't get that much for having been there 50 years?  Oh, he gets a lot.  And Susan?  Is your name Susan?  Yes.  The question, I'm trying to put this delicately.  We saw the story and we were touched by it.  And we wanted to know if Leonard is...  You can't say the same stuff you can say in 1940, which is, you know, rhymes with E-arted.  But is he a little slow or a little bit learning, kind of disabled or anything like that? 
[02:15:00]  Um, no, but as you get a little old, you get a little handicapped, you can't quite keep up.  So, but what about the 30 years before?  Or is it the mop?  Yeah.  I'm sorry?  Like the 30 years before, like he's 68 now.  How about when he was, uh, say 22 years ago when he was what, 40?  45.  45?  Yeah.  He was pretty good.  Is his mind really sharp?  Yes. 
[02:15:30]  Hmm.  Am I wrong on this?  I think he's a shrewd guy.  I just think we want to know why he never, why he never ascended to your level.  We want to know why he never got a real job.  A real job?  This is a real job.  Maybe a promotion.  No, to your level.  Why didn't he, isn't he at least your same, like why wouldn't he go to management?  That's what we're trying to figure out.  He didn't want to.  He didn't want to.  He was the maintenance man originally.  Maintenance man.  Wow.  And now, and now he's like a bus boy?  He can't, now he can't lift and do the trash and do the maintenance, so now he's the lobby 
[02:16:00]  man.  Okay.  Interesting.  And what is that, what is he, what is his actual duties?  What does he have to do?  Um, he cleans the dining room, talks to the customers.  Yeah.  Fills lids, straws, napkins, fakes out.  Now, do you worry about him doing things to the burgers?  No, he don't go back with the burgers.  Oh, he don't, you don't let him fuck with the food?  No, no.  Oh, Susan, we really want to know why he's just a clean up guy. 
[02:16:30]  I mean, you gotta let us in on this.  There's a story behind this that isn't coming out.  Why is he still just the clean up guy?  That's what he can do.  Oh boy, they're not fessing up.  Does he get touchy feely with the rest of the employees?  Any, any human resources problems?  Oh, shit.  Is he trying to?  Susan's funny.  She can't, she can't tell.  Is he trying to spread his, his own special sauce? 
[02:17:00]  He's back to him fucking the burgers.  No.  Susan, you, Susan's hilarious.  Yeah, I like Susan.  Oh my God, man.  I like Susan a lot.  Susan, well, good old Leonard.  Susan.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right, can we talk to Leonard again?  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Put Leonard on a little more.  I believe you're a corporate McDonald's guy and you're in the fire room, please.  Shh, shh.  Can you do that?  Yeah.  Hello, Leonard.  Yeah, this is me again.  Hi, this is Bill Zamwick with McDonald's Corporation. 
[02:17:30]  How are you?  This is who?  Bill Zamwick.  Yes.  I'm with the McDonald's Corporation.  Oh, yes.  And you've put in 50 years of service with us, I recently learned.  And I just want to let you know, something has come up.  You know, we have been in a recession.  You do understand this.  Have been what?  In a recession.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, you've heard about that.  Leonard, I'm very sorry. 
[02:18:00]  We're going to have to let you go.  Okay.  We're going to have to let you go.  Now, I'm heartbroken about this.  Okay.  The McDonald's Corporation recognizes your years of diligent service with the company.  But you're going to have to clean out your stuff.  And we'll let you finish out the week.  But on Friday, I'm really sorry.  You're being terminated.  Okay. 
[02:18:30]  Who are you going to replace me with?  Well, we're doing away with the position.  It is useless.  It's been deemed redundant.  There's other people that can do that.  I really do apologize for this.  I'm sorry.  I'm terribly sorry.  Okay.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, why don't you just, you know something, just pack up now and take  off.  Okay.  Yeah, because it's pretty much over. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, shit, dude.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  No, fuck him.  We don't have to call no one back.  Oh, he hung up.  By the way, that wasn't open.  No, that wasn't me.  That wasn't me.  It's all right.  What's he going to do?  Walk in front of a bus?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Crikey.  Crikey.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened to Leonard? 
[02:19:30]  Hey, Leonard.  Oh, no.  Leonard jumped in front of a...  Oh, that was so sad.  You're fired.  Oh, poor Leonard.  That's so sad.  I think he really thought he was fired.  That's so sad.  I feel bad.  Call back.  No, I don't get that.  Call back.  Please call McDonald's back.  The manager will tell him he's not fired.  Nope.  Or she'll call corporate and they'll go, he's been there.  What?  Get rid of that motherfucker.  He'll be fired.  I'm not going to know.  She's probably talking to him right now.  Oh, my heart.  That was so sad.  He's probably crying.  He's like...  Oh, that was so... 
[02:20:00]  That was so sad.  What if he doesn't even talk to her and he throws himself on the grill or something?  Oh, he just starts cooking himself?  That's so sad.  Goes out like a burger.  He's got so much grease in his clothes, he just goes up like a Hindu...  Oh, poor Leonard.  Poor Leonard.  Aw.  That was pretty fucking cold.  People are asking if we're going to be on the air tomorrow.  I don't know.  That's what I was fucking thinking, man!  Didn't that sound like something we'd get fired for?  That sounded terrible. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, come on.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Mike?  Yo, I've been listening to you guys for 12 years.  And I've never, ever hit my limit.  And you just hit my limit.  You just told a retarded man who's worked for 50 years that you're going to be fired.  Oh, that's so terrible.  And you probably will be fired tomorrow.  Oh, I hope not.  Someone on Instant Feedback just writes, no prank calls, huh?  Hey, fuck you, Stephen King.  You enlightened us. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, fuck Stephen King.  We were inspired by Stephen King.  That's right.  Leonard, Leonard.  Leonard.  I hope Leonard's okay.  We can call McDonald's.  Why won't we call McDonald's back and say Leonard was joking?  Because there's no fun in that.  Kerry, what's up?  Yeah, it's the whole thing of not knowing.  Kerry, what's up?  We like going through our day wondering.  I want to thank you guys for the years of laughter.  I've enjoyed your last program.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  I like being nervous every time the phone rings when I go home now.  Oh, yeah.  I like the phone rings and I go, oh, shit. 
[02:21:30]  Jimmy the Creep writes, that's what I love about the O&A show.  Every show could be their last.  No.  Oh, cranky.  Redding from GenericShow.com.  Leonard probably just went to his car and pulled a gun from the glove.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck balls, man.  I'm telling y'all.  I nigh.  Lean it.  Oh, no.  I nigh.  Pull lean it.  Like, he thinks they light him off. 
[02:22:00]  I nigh.  I nigh.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  I nigh.  Oh, well.  What can I tell you?  Oh, well.  Larry King is checking in, Anthony.  No, I meant a Hindu because sometimes Hindus, like, protest by dousing themselves in gas and  lighting themselves on fire.  Ah, cat.  Larry.  She thought I meant Hindenburg and said it wrong.  Okay.  Gentlemen, how important are your jobs?  Oh, Larry.  Oh, Larry.  It's a strange machine from Dallas, right?  It's times like these. 
[02:22:30]  I wish you guys had a hole.  Yeah.  See, the hole would have been, oh, no, Leonard.  It's okay, Leonard.  You still have a job.  Oh, no.  I nigh.  Leonard's little old mental voice was just.  Well, let's see how.  He did sound a little, like, down.  He was like, yeah.  What?  Let's see the reach of the show.  Anybody out there close to this McDonald's, you know, be a reporter on the scene.  Yeah, go there and see how Leonard is.  Where's the McDonald's?  I'm curious.  Yeah.  Crestwood, Missouri?  Someone just wrote that.  I bet you he just ran headfirst into the frioling. 
[02:23:00]  The friolator.  He just put his head in the friolator.  Oh, John from Virginia.  Tomorrow they're going to find Leonard hanging with the words, Leonard was here.  That's why we got the funniest listeners on the radio, motherfuckers.  Oh, shit.  Leonard was here.  McDonald's redemption.  Oh, Jesus.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  I can picture Leonard riding his tricycle away in tears.  Oh, his big wheel.  Yeah.  Oh, poor guy. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, well.  I wish that character that I play on the radio didn't do that.  Sometimes I pass by the McDonald's I used to work at, and I know I don't work there no more.  I could smell the french fries and burgers, but that's long gone.  My job's over.  Remember, I was fired the other day by some stranger on a telephone.  Life just goes too fast. 
[02:24:00]  I don't think they'll miss old Leonard much.  So I'm leaving.  I'm just going to toss this rope over this beam and clumsily kick the fucking stool out with my old man shoes.  Instead of tossing the rope over the beam, he could toss his big tongue over the beam.  And he probably has a Leonard.  He probably has a pet sesame seed bun that he kept on his shoulder.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  What would management say? 
[02:24:30]  I have a comment, official comment.  Oh, sorry.  I did so many bad things.  There.  You said something, though, in that, though, that actually made it make sense for me.  Yeah?  I just got fired by a stranger on the phone.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  He was talking to the radio station, and then all of a sudden, the manager gives him the phone.  Susan is probably rolling right now. 
[02:25:00]  Susan's laughing her head off.  Susan isn't appreciating the fact that this guy has been there 50 years.  She's been doing all the work for 22 of those years.  That actually makes me feel better that you would actually add that.  And here's the thing that's funny.  You had to figure it out yourself.  Like, oh, shit, this is kind of dicey.  But it's like, nah, a stranger just fired you?  You fucking idiot.  It doesn't happen like that over the phone.  You know what, Leonard?  The day after his big party.  Leonard is retarded.  Leonard's stupid.  Steven asks from Bayshore again, I just pretend you were playing a tape of an old bit you did years ago. 
[02:25:30]  That's a good way to look at it.  Oh, shit, that hat.  Yeah, Vince A. from Beyond, very depressed, Anthony.  There will be no Leonard Part 7.  Oh.  That's fucking funny.  Leonard 68.  Oh, man.  Mm-hmm.  Damn.  I'm just trying to see if we have, okay. 
[02:26:00]  Let's say hi to Brian in Jersey.  Brian, how are you?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Radio Gold.  Thank you.  I don't think anyone picked up on it, but Anthony snuck in a line there, line of the day.  I went up like a Hindu.  Oh, well, yeah.  Anthony said that.  Yeah, well, sorry.  Unbelievable.  You guys are the best.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah, maybe if you just stayed on the phone a little bit longer.  You would have learned that he was ripe to 12. 
[02:26:30]  Ripe.  Oh, no.  Ripe.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Larry King checking in.  Larry.  Oh, hello, boys.  Hold on.  I'm eating a Popeye's biscuit right now.  Oh, fuck, Larry.  Leonard, how important is the paycheck?  Apparently very.  Hope Leonard's okay.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, no.  A few moments ago, we told an elderly gentleman at a McDonald's that he was fired.  I want to apologize for that.  I know.  We didn't know.  Oh, God.  How could we have known?  I know.  I know.  She won't let him back with the food.  Huh?  She won't let him go back.  He fucks the fucking burger.  He's doing something.  He's doing something. 
[02:27:30]  He's doing something.  Oh, boy.  Brian and Callie.  Brian.  Puts his dick in the McNuggets.  Brian.  Hey, how are you guys doing, man?  Good, man.  Hey, guess who was the hole on that McDonald's?  Patrice O'Neal with the hole.  Yeah.  Oh, a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you hear that old man?  You cruel piece of garbage.  That motherfucker went, huh?  If he believed it for a second, that's him.  That retarded 50.  He's been working at McDonald's longer than I've been alive. 
[02:28:00]  He had 50 years of grease under his nails.  Oh, shit.  And he thought he was fired.  They won't let him back with the burgers.  This motherfucker's a mess.  You cocksucker.  Why?  Jesus, evil bastards.  That was bad.  It was sad for a second.  That was sad.  I was getting a little sad.  I didn't say stop, but I was sad.  His voice was like, you know, oh, okay, okay, I'm fired, okay.  Yeah, people are saying they can check out the McDonald's.  Just go and check it out and call us, please. 
[02:28:30]  Strange Machine in Dallas writes, hope you had a hell of a piss, Susan.  Fucking fast times.  That's great.  Oh, shit.  He'll probably hang himself from the arches.  That's cigars and scotch.  Oh, man honored for 50 years of service at McDonald's  and completely fucking torn down here in a matter of minutes.  It's just 50 years.  The reason we called was because we were mad at the fucking owner. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  Should we take a break?  Okay.  We'll take a break.  We'll make believe that didn't happen.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  Oh, that shouldn't have happened like that.  Oh, no.  We busted his spirit.  Hey, I know.  It's all the old bloke had to live for.  That's it.  Kanye West would have wrecked his moment anyway.  I know.  50 years of service.  I'm sure Kanye would have had something. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, we got to do the Kanye West thing still, right?  Let me tell you,  Ronald McDonald was much more important than McDonald's than Leonard.  Let me know.  You can finish in a minute.  Ronald McDonald's a big red-headed motherfucker.  He is the one that everybody knows much more than Leonard.  So, I think Leonard ought to go shuffle out of the buffalo.  Now, I'm done.  I look silly.  Now, I'm going to go cry on the motherfucker Jay Leno for...  Oh, no.  Ay, nye.  Right, right. 
[02:30:00]  How long are we supposed to do this show anyway?  I know, really.  Think about it.  What the fuck?  All right.  You know, whenever we go into those...  Remember a few minutes ago when we said we could get him on the phone or get that McDonald's  on the phone and we said strap in?  We never know where it's going.  That's right.  That has been our downfall every single time. 
[02:30:30]  Of course.  We just don't know where any of this is going.  And, Sam, if we would have fucking left at 8 o'clock like we wanted to...  That's right.  ...perhaps Leonard would never have fucking gotten that call.  I absolutely blame Sam at this point.  Sam is to blame.  This is on theater anyway.  What?  See, Sam, this is what...  Let me tell you what happens to the radio.  No, Leonard's a fucking guy in a production studio down the hall.  It's E-Rock.  Yeah, that was E-Rock.  Sam, let me tell you what happens to the radio.  Okay.  Me and Ant are the big stars of the show.  Yes, you are.  You guys are doing a great job.  Thank you.  Could you say huge? 
[02:31:00]  Huge stars.  Yeah, that's true.  And we do stuff like we just did.  Yeah, it's great.  Management gets all over our shit, and they're like, God damn it.  We got to do something.  We got to show that we did something.  That we're responsible broadcasters.  Yeah.  And that's when Ant and I, we turn to Steve Blatter and go, you're right.  Fire Sam.  Why would you say that?  Because we have to offer up somebody.  We need a head to roll.  And then the press goes, well, they fired the guy that was responsible.  First of all, I don't...  You, Sam.  And then we get to continue making millions.  I don't see the point in... 
[02:31:30]  Oh, shit.  Saying I'm responsible.  Sam looked at me.  Nigga, I don't work here.  I'm just a friend visiting.  Ta-ta, motherfucker.  You pretty much have to throw yourself on the sword.  Yeah.  I don't know why of all this...  For the greater good.  Call Vince McMahon.  He's hiring.  You know, a smart man once said, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or  the one.  That is Mr. Spock.  Right.  From the Wrath of Khan.  Right.  I mean, you have to run into that chamber and get the mains back online for us. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  So we can warp away from Khan and the Genesis device.  Do you understand?  I understand.  I feel like if we fire another person on staff, we'd probably free up a lot more money in the  company.  All right.  E-Rock's gone.  Okay.  By the way...  I'm an easy sell.  Okay, cool.  I don't care.  By the way, let me just say this.  You're on the same category to me.  Yeah.  People I really don't need to be around.  Well, I don't know.  Let me just say this.  When we have to apologize at 730 tomorrow because that's when everyone's listening.  Right. 
[02:32:30]  We don't mean it.  We don't mean it.  Okay.  You'll hear us reading something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Marcel S. from Rhode Island writes, Leonard can finally play his favorite game, bobbing for onion  rings.  All right.  That was terrible.  Wow.  I wonder if I'm going to feel bad about that on the drive home.  Listen, man.  Fuck you.  I don't feel bad.  Fuck this.  Fuck this.  Listen to me.  This is like the Fortress of Solitude.  Fuck you.  Let me tell you something, man. 
[02:33:00]  I'm going to beat a hole right now.  I swear to you.  When you said...  Hey, Leonard.  All right.  Hold it.  You got to shut up for just a second.  Every day.  It's torture.  Okay.  What, Patrice?  Leonard?  Were you saying something?  Yeah.  And you can see she likes us.  Oh, there's no love here.  Believe me.  When he goes...  When you go...  Leonard, this is...  I don't even remember the name.  I just make him up.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  I'm from the main office.  Leonard said...  He got happy.  And then I...  That's when I went, fuck.  He went, yes?  Oh.  Oh.  Yes?  Like, this was his big...  Like...  They finally noticed me after 50 years of service.  I'm going to tell you what...  I'm going to tell you what...  They gave me balloons.  They gave me a cake.  Let me tell you what...  But here comes the car.  He was hoping...  He said the same...  He had the same excitement as the guy at the bottom of the ship that was in the oil  on Waterworld.  Oh, that motherfucker. 
[02:34:00]  We've got about six yards of the black stuff.  Leonard thought he was going to be killed.  Yeah.  And his family would be taken care of.  Right.  He went, yeah?  Yeah?  And then you was like, you know, there is a recession.  And he went, oh.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Oh, fuck.  That's when it started hurting.  And I'm like, don't do it.  Just don't get him emotionally...  If he had to say, go fuck yourself.  You're the radio guys.  You would go, Leonard.  Yeah.  And then, oh, Leonard's on to us. 
[02:34:30]  You think Leonard might be...  This is what's happening right now.  Leonard is in the back crying on top of a box of FedExed frozen ketchup packets.  And Susan's going, they were radio guys, Leonard.  You're okay.  It's okay.  No.  Get back to...  She's consoling this fucking asshole.  Why her garbage is piling up.  You fucking...  There's no trays left.  They're all stacked up on the fucking garbage cans. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, fuck balls, man.  Oh.  Leonard's wiping his tears with that fucking jersey he hasn't taken off.  That made me feel so fucking bad, man.  I'm going to feel bad when I leave.  That's how this show works.  In this fucking studio, I'm impervious to guilt.  Yeah, because we're...  The second I leave, I start going, why did I do that?  No, I am because this studio is filled with evil.  Yes.  And then you go outside.  It's a bright, sunny day.  You see normal people, like normal human beings.  And you get sucked into that whole thing.  Here's the thing you have to understand, Anthony. 
[02:35:30]  You ruined one man's day.  That's Leonard.  Life, by the way.  Life.  His whole life.  Yeah.  But he's just one man.  Do you know how much joy you doing that to Leonard brought to so many people?  He makes a point.  Again, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.  We're getting an update.  We're getting an update.  Scott in Missouri.  Scott.  Scott.  Holy shit.  Guys, I really hope that that was fucking Leonard I just saw at the bus stop.  I'm not shitting you.  I just drove through Crestwood, Missouri.  I live here in St. Louis. 
[02:36:00]  I'm listening to you on the iPhone, so it's delayed a little bit.  Right.  As I'm driving along, just as you're saying this shit, about 150 yards down the road,  there's an old guy walking up to a bus stop in a McDonald's uniform.  No way.  I don't know if it's fucking Leonard, but I'm not shitting you.  It could have been an old fucker going to work, but if that was Leonard.  Maybe his shift's over.  Oh, no.  Really?  His shift's over?  Where's he starting?  3.30 in the morning?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Leonard.  What happened to Leonard?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He thinks we tossed him one in the freckle.  I love that we got to Patrice.  You could have seen it on his face.  Because it's just that old man went, yeah?  Yeah.  He was very excited at first.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Ant?  Hey, look at it this way.  He's not Patrick Swayze.  That's like kind of an up. 
[02:37:00]  Yep.  That's a positive.  All right.  I feel bad.  Fuck balls.  I pray to Jesus right now to forgive me.  Yes, you can.  Okay, Jesus, please forgive me because I think that was a sin of some sort.  I don't know what.  Really?  Is that in the Bible calling up an old guy at a McDonald's?  No.  There was no phones in the Bible.  Then I'm cool.  Forget it then.  All right, Jesus, forget it.  All right.  I'll call you back.  All right.  We'll be back.  I'll text you.  Oh, man. 
[02:37:30]  What happened to Robert Kelly?  We made him wait because we were in the middle of a bit.  I hope he's not mad at us.  I saw him outside the studio.  We couldn't bring him in.  We were in the middle of the whole Leonard thing.  In the middle of talking to the wonderful Leonard, congratulations, 50 years.  I have nothing but the best thoughts and prayers for Leonard.  And leave it to us to fuck it all up for him.  All right.  What?  Let's keep it nice.  Sorry.  Remember what Swayze said?  Be nice. 
[02:38:00]  This was in fucking Roadhouse, my friend.  Be nice.  He said, if someone gives you shit, calls you a cocksucker, be nice.  Be nice.  Just lead them out.  If they don't want to leave, you make them leave.  But be nice.  Now, Bob Kelly, I saw him outside.  Right.  Yeah.  And, of course, we couldn't invite him in during that interview.  I'm just getting word.  What?  I'm just getting word.  What happened?  Bob Kelly went to the Gap. 
[02:38:30]  He's on his way up.  He got tired of waiting, so he went to the Gap.  What, the 8 o'clock in the morning Gap?  What Gap did he just walk by?  Is that P.  Diddy?  Holy crap.  Where?  That's not no P.  Diddy, motherfucker.  He's walking down the hall.  Where?  I don't think that was.  I didn't see no P. Diddy.  What?  I didn't see no P. Diddy.  I don't think that was him.  Oh.  There's another.  Oh, damn.  Holy shit.  Oprah Winfrey just walked on by.  Why would you stop? 
[02:39:00]  What?  That's not her.  Are you sure?  She works here at SiriusXM.  I'm positive.  Yeah, downstairs at the security desk.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, Christ, huh?  She's an ass.  You have fun over there?  Down there at the desk?  Just.  We got to get into the Kanye West thing.  Patrice O'Neal is going to be at the punchline.  I think you're flying out tomorrow, right, Patrice?  Yeah.  And you're going to be there Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Yes.  Tickets at LiveNation.com.  The punchline in San Francisco.  Patrice O'Neal.  That's a solid show right there.  Solid.  Check out Patrice O'Neal in San Francisco.  A lot of fans out there. 
[02:39:30]  Ah, yeah.  Did a little time on vacation in San Francisco before I made the drive to L.A.  There's a lot of fucking fans of this show out there.  Mr. Norton said the same thing.  I just want to acknowledge that.  When he played up there.  Pretty cool.  Well, Anthony, the Taylorgate.  They're calling it Taylorgate.  Taylorgate.  0-9 continues.  Gate at the end of it.  Now, look.  Do we have Leonardgate happening down the hall?  We're not talking about Leonardgate.  We'd like to simplify everything for people.  Maybe Leonard could get a job at the foodway. 
[02:40:00]  Kanye West did what he did.  And everybody tweeted, what an asshole.  This is simplifying everything.  Okay?  Yes.  Now, that's it.  Taylor Swift is huge because of what Kanye West did.  Even bigger than she was.  Yes.  Some would argue she was huge.  Even bigger.  But let me tell you something.  Ant didn't know who Taylor Swift was.  I sort of knew who she was.  Sort of.  Heard the name.  But if I saw her, I wouldn't have known that that was her.  I wouldn't.  I just thought she was some skinny, anorexic-looking fucking blonde chick. 
[02:40:30]  Now, we've got to change our tune.  I really believe that Taylor Swift should send Kanye West a ridiculous...  Thank you.  A ridiculous thank you.  Something just over-the-top cool.  The View hasn't been on yet, right?  No, she's going to be on The View.  She's going to be on The View.  I want to hear it.  Everyone knows who Taylor Swift is.  And I guarantee...  And she made a statement?  ...that she sold a shitload of fucking...  Oh, of course.  ...units or whatever they're called these days.  You know what?  Not that she needed the help, but you know what?  If that was a mainstream show and not like MTV, if that was like the Grammys or something 
[02:41:00]  like that, where Ma and Pa Kettle from the Midwest watch and watched a black guy just  beating up on a skinny little blonde chick like that, there'd been a lot more outrage,  I think.  A lot more outrage.  No, there's a lot of outrage, though, Ant.  There's a lot, yeah.  Yeah, but not like that kind of middle America outrage.  They made it more racial.  It's not really racial right now, you know?  Right.  Which it shouldn't be.  It's just fucking Kanye being a douchebag.  But you know what? 
[02:41:30]  It did her a favor, man.  In the end, it's a great thing for her.  It really is.  Yeah, people are going to want to hear what she's all about.  I think you're right.  Yeah, she's going to be interviewed everywhere.  She'll probably make it to Larry King.  She's on The View.  Oh, great.  Bobby, we're sorry.  Oh, Bobby.  We're sorry.  Oh, no.  Did we chase you away?  No.  What happened?  Where'd you go?  I went down to smoke a butt, and then I went to the gap.  You went to the gap?  We were in the middle of getting someone fired after 50 years of service.  Yeah, I want nothing to do with this karma.  Yeah, I know.  Poor old guy. 
[02:42:00]  This karma.  I want nothing to do with it.  I feel bad for the old guy.  I know.  I know when I leave here, I'm going to have that fucking Bill Burr moment.  I hate those fucking moments.  When me and Bill Burr are in here, and Bill gets caught up a lot of times in the fucking  event.  We all do.  In the event.  We all do.  You get this pack mentality.  And then when we leave, I'm kind of okay.  And then stupid Burr's like, you think what we did was kind of fucked up?  Do you think what we...  Dude, he goes, I just don't feel very good about...  I have this weird, like, bad feeling. 
[02:42:30]  Like, Bill, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, really.  Now you're making me think what the fuck I did over here.  You know?  Keep that...  Keep that...  Keep that bad vibe to yourself.  Oh, no.  I, no.  Tessous.  I, no.  I'm a dick to death.  I'm a dick to death.  I, no.  I, no.  Sometimes I leave the show, and I just feel like I was in on a rape.  Yeah, it is.  Like that weird kind of...  It's a ripe.  It's now called a ripe.  I was in on a ripe.  A ripe.  And I'm the guy that...  When all was three of all was right. 
[02:43:00]  Okay?  Okay?  So, Kanye West, what's your feelings on Kanye West?  We were second into that there, Robert Kelly.  You know what's weird?  I didn't...  I heard kind of what happened, and then I watched it last night.  And I didn't know when it was supposed to happen.  I don't know how many awards she won.  And then she came out and sang her song, or took her award, and they showed the song that  she sang.  And as soon as she won, I was like, for that...  I...  He said what everybody felt.  Whoa.  Because as soon as she won, I was like, that song stinks. 
[02:43:30]  That could be like a jingle for a Snickers commercial.  But it was for best video, not best song.  Yeah, they already had...  They were already giving Beyonce the big award.  Yeah, but he...  I mean, that song stinks.  The video stinks.  Yeah.  It's a happy...  It should be on Nickelodeon.  I never heard the song.  I never heard of her.  How's the song go?  It's very poppy.  Very fancy.  Poppy little thing.  It's fucking stupid.  It's gross.  I can't believe he grabbed the mic away from her.  That's what it was.  It just was...  That was like an assault.  It was really...  She is pure as the driven snow. 
[02:44:00]  She is the definition of white woman.  If you talk about...  Like, this is what I'm saying.  There's all kinds of white.  And she is at the highest level of, don't you put your negroid hands...  Oh, shit.  You know how many...  Even if it had been pink.  Yeah.  Because she would have been like...  Because she's a little ghetto.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Well, pink would have...  She would have did something.  She would have punched her or something.  She was a deer in the headlights.  She had no clue what the fuck to do with this situation.  So she stood there just like...  My heart was beating. 
[02:44:30]  I don't know what to...  What do I do?  I'm white.  Now, there's a report, supposedly...  Yeah.  That...  How it went down from one of my black entertainment sites called Mediatakeout.com.  And they report that Jay-Z and Beyonce had a little problem after it because Kanye was in the back talking about whether he was going to do it or not.  And supposedly Jay-Z said, go ahead, man.  Do that shit.  And then Beyonce was like, holy shit. 
[02:45:00]  And then Beyonce did a backhanded kind of betrayal maneuver against Jay-Z by bringing her up to say fuck what Kanye did.  And supposedly now her and Jay-Z are having an issue.  But that's supposedly.  That's quote, end quote.  Wow.  Damn, call TMZ.  Gonna have to...  You got an exclusive.  Gonna have to send our reporter Sam in to find out more info on that one.  I would love to do that.  Yeah, I bet you would.  What? 
[02:45:30]  I would love to do that.  Who gives a shit his mic isn't on?  All right, listen.  So, Taylorgate.  Pink.  Pink, very angry, Anthony.  She was on the Today Show.  She's a very angry woman.  Yeah.  And she had this to say.  Tell me about last night.  You were there at the VMAs when this whole Kanye thing happened.  I was there.  It was the one time I really, really wish I would have won because I had this amazing Alexander McQueen purse with brass knuckles.  Oh, shit.  Is she saying she would have taken care of this situation?  Oh, Pinkett.  You're crazy. 
[02:46:00]  TC Beagle.  I love the people that say that, really, but you weren't.  It's easy to say, I wish I was up there.  You know what, though?  She wouldn't have stood there like, I took my microphone.  McDonald's arches.  Can I just say something?  Yeah.  Can I just say something?  Go ahead.  That is probably one of the most amazing things you've ever seen.  The one I had today, I was telling Anthony about.  Please pass that to him.  I'm not passing.  I see it.  I don't even want to touch a phone with a picture of your duty.  Oh, let me check out your.  No, I wouldn't let you touch my phone. 
[02:46:30]  You said to pass it over.  No, really.  Let me see it.  Can I just say why this is amazing?  This was after the initial, and then I think there's a little more.  Let me just try.  How do you throw up looking at things, and then you can just take pictures of your own  shit when it's disgusting?  Let me see it.  Could I have the phone, please?  I'm not handing you my phone.  But that.  Bobby.  Bobby, an iPhone.  Don't puke again, Bobby.  Bobby.  Patrice is just going in the middle.  Bobby, you can trust me.  I know how much an iPhone is.  I wouldn't do that. 
[02:47:00]  Can I see it, Dan?  For real?  I'll walk it to you.  All right.  Let me see it, though.  Please.  Oh, my God.  No, let me see it.  Hold it.  I'm going to.  Let me see it.  I'm not going to mess with your iPhone.  Why'd you throw it into a pillow?  Wasn't it a pillow?  Look at the inside.  There's guts in there.  All right.  Well.  All right.  Enough with the fucking prolapsed asshole.  So let's see what Pink would have done in that situation, eh?  Here's Pink. 
[02:47:30]  This amazing Alexander McQueen purse with brass knuckles on it.  You would have used them.  And honestly, I don't think it would have happened if I were up there.  But Taylor Swift is awesome.  She deserved her moment.  That guy is.  You went on.  You tweeted.  You tweeted about it.  Did you notice how I cut you off?  I thought, my God, she's going to say what she tweeted.  Yeah.  You were rather, you know.  I was upset.  Pointed in your tweet.  You said he is the biggest blank on the earth.  Yeah.  On the planet. 
[02:48:00]  He's that kind of racism in this day and age.  Your heart goes out to Taylor.  Yeah.  And I think Beyonce is a classy lady for what she did at the end.  How classy was that?  How classy was that?  I just think he's an idiot.  He's just a waste.  He's just a little toolbox.  All right.  No.  Don't hold back.  And you know what?  He's getting exactly what he wants right now.  People are talking about him.  Let's stop.  Let's stop.  Okay.  As opposed to what?  Let's stop.  Yeah.  And then talk about what?  What you're doing today, Pink.  Yeah.  Listen.  First of all, this is the thing. 
[02:48:30]  What makes me sick about the business is that what you're supposed to do, they do.  He's an asshole because he did his asshole thing.  And Beyonce is magnanimous because she did her fucking wonderful thing.  Yeah, right.  And there's no context to it.  It's like, really?  Beyonce did that out the kindness of her heart for this fucking little cracker who was hurt.  Do you know how many motherfuckers get hurt in this game?  How many people?  How many songs she steals?  How many people who aren't in the business that just write songs? 
[02:49:00]  Beyonce steals them.  But this fucking girl with this shitty hit and that Oonga Boonga fucking drunk Kanye who really took the mic and said...  Oonga Boonga.  Took the mic and said...  This is what he said.  Hey, Taylor.  I ain't taking nothing from you.  You cool, bae.  It wasn't even about Taylor.  It was just like...  It could have been anybody.  He would have did it with Pink and she would have stood there and went...  Oh, no. 
[02:49:30]  He didn't with her fucking...  Because she watches the Popeye's Chicken commercial shit.  So that's when she gets all black women.  I would have took my brass knuckles out of my bag.  Put them on and knock Kanye out.  Really?  Shut up, bitch.  Exactly.  So, ultimately, the fucking...  So, Beyonce, she fucking brings her up to get that fucking reaction.  And the crowd...  And this is what I'm saying about Hollywood.  I've been around a long time. 
[02:50:00]  None of them motherfuckers stand on their own by themselves with their own opinion.  None of them.  Barely.  Maybe a Sean Penn will do this shit because he don't give a fuck.  There's some guys, some made men.  But I'm going to tell you, these young fucking 25-year-olds, whatever this...  I mean, we're Generation X, but these other motherfuckers...  I don't know what generation they are.  They do not just go, fuck you, Kanye.  Because Pink wants a hit song and Kanye makes them.  He's not...  He's a producer also. 
[02:50:30]  He's not just fucking Kanye fucking West.  He produces hit songs.  They're not going to curse out this fucking hit machine because they just feel like it.  For some little skinny white girl.  This is horse shit.  Wow.  Horse shit.  God damn.  Wrapped up in a nice little package there.  There's so much black stuff I don't know.  Well...  Yeah.  I didn't know he produces stuff there.  He's a monster.  He's a mega producer.  Mega?  Mega.  Let's move on.  And she steals songs.  Beyonce steals...  Well, they all do. 
[02:51:00]  Look at...  First of all, and it's not even going to be...  It can't be no fucking...  What's it?  Libel or whatever.  Yeah, man.  Because it's a million people a day.  Yeah.  This bitch will...  She'll go on MySpace, listen to somebody who's just...  You know how they're saying, hey, listen to this song.  Some bitch will go, if you like it, then you should have put a ring on my finger.  She goes, if you like it, then you should have put a ring on my finger.  And that bitch is done.  Finished.  Beyonce upset.  If you like it, then you should have...  And another bitch goes, if you love me, then you should have gave me a ring and put 
[02:51:30]  it on my finger, and bam, she knows how to make it up.  I like both.  It's a fact.  Both have a wonderful...  I like both versions.  I like both versions.  But I'm telling you...  Is that a fake example or a real example?  No, that's a real example.  That's a fake example.  Okay.  So let me say that, because I don't know.  Yeah.  But there are songs...  That is a fake example, but there are songs that's just fact that people...  That's obviously been done before.  I got you.  Yes, man.  Because you told us that you got what I need.  Yeah, that was true.  I never knew that was a real song. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  All right.  But 50 Cent got involved with this whole Kanye thing.  And then we're leading up to Jay Leno and Kanye West crying last night on Leno's show.  What a nice one for Leno, huh?  First night out of the box with his new show.  Gets Kanye to cry.  So I want to ask you first, though.  Did you watch Kanye last night?  Did you watch the VMAs?  Yeah, I saw the VMAs.  Did you have a comment on that?  Because I know you had your own sort of like award show moment in 2004, but tell me what  you think about that.  That was interesting.  Like, I mean, when you nominated for the first time, what you saw for me in 2004 was the Grammys. 
[02:52:30]  Uh-huh.  When I went up, Urban Essence won the best new artist.  And it was like, I sold 12 million records.  It's the largest debut in hip-hop album to date.  And I was overlooked.  And I still don't have a Grammy.  It's been 13 nominations.  Because I wrote the harsh realities, I've been overlooked completely.  So when you got an artist there for the first time, and you go and you want to tell them  like, we know Beyonce is great.  Of course.  You know that?  Like, there's nobody that's confused in that actual area. 
[02:53:00]  But Taylor Swift is great and is new at that point.  And you can't replace it.  Even an apology can't replace what it feels like for the very first time receiving that  award.  But now, in her head, my first award was Kanye West.  Ah, yep.  Yeah.  You know, it's damaging.  But I wish she would come take one of my awards so I could black his eye.  We said yesterday.  And in front of everybody.  That's what we said yesterday.  You might not have put up with it the way that she did. 
[02:53:30]  He's making choose who you feel safe doing that with, though.  Be honest.  Like, you shouldn't worry about me.  Pink was finna get to him.  That was our whole point yesterday, though.  We're like, he wouldn't do this in front of...  This is collusion, man.  This is Hollywood collusion.  No, they...  It's in the fucking books now that we all agree that Kanye's a fucking dick.  We all agree that he's an asshole.  There's no context to it. 
[02:54:00]  There's no forgiveness for it.  The motherfucker was drunk.  And at the same time...  Was he really drunk?  I question that even.  Maybe, but he was doing some goofy shit that they all fucking do.  And this is the most villainous thing you've ever seen in this area?  He took the thing...  I'm telling you, again, it's hard to...  Listen, racism is like Bigfoot.  You can't prove it exists.  Everybody thinks it kind of does.  But I never met a motherfucker who was.  So, at the end of the day, this evil fucking N-word fuck with this pure white... 
[02:54:30]  He just used Bigfoot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We believe it.  We believe in that Nessie photo.  But can we prove it?  No.  A nigga fuck with a white girl.  Not just a white girl.  This girl...  Other white girls feel like she's a white girl.  Like, oh my god, white girl.  Oh, no.  Pink is like, she can handle it, though.  Watch out.  She got the crazy hair doing the tattoos.  But this girl, no tattoos? 
[02:55:00]  Not even of a butterfly on her foot?  Pure.  Pure.  Oh my god.  Not even a period.  Oh my god.  She's like 19.  She's so innocent and a fuck...  I don't like when motherfuckers gang up, man.  It's like, look, 50 don't give a fuck.  He don't give a fuck.  And then for him to say Pink was going to give...  I would have liked that whole thing.  Pink wasn't going to do shit.  Pink is like Fonzie.  Always threatening, but you never saw...  Yeah.  Like Anthony said a long time ago, you never saw Fonzie actually fight.  It would have been nice if... 
[02:55:30]  Pink isn't going to do shit.  If 50 had have said, let's be honest, Pink wouldn't have did shit either.  Now, do I believe that 50 would have knocked him out?  Probably so.  Hell fucking good.  Or Tony Ayo or somebody would have got to him.  But would Pink have?  Hell fucking not.  But that's what I'm saying.  You know, to give her that credit, you can't...  She wouldn't have done shit.  She wouldn't have done shit.  You're absolutely right.  She's over his house right now.  Let's move on to Jay Leno last night.  So Jay Leno's new show started.  Let's not forget, Jimmy's on the show tonight. 
[02:56:00]  So make sure you take a peek tonight and help those ratings for Leno.  You know, I think we can help a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit, right?  If everyone tunes in.  Yes.  Norton on tonight.  And wow.  Jay Leno had Kanye West on last night.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  That's the star.  The star is just aligning just right, right?  How the fuck?  Yeah, that's one of those like...  It's just going to be Kanye West.  And then it's...  No, it's Kanye West.  Yeah, they must have been creaming in their pants when that happened.  Well, did you guys hear this, Patrice, Robert? 
[02:56:30]  I saw it, yeah.  You got Kanye West talking to Jay Leno about being wrong.  Let me say thank you for honoring this commitment.  A lot of times people, things happen, they kind of back out at the last minute or they  have a publicist or someone call and say, oh, I'm sorry, my client's not available.  So thank you for coming and doing this in light of all the things that are going on.  Tell us about your day.  Have you had a tough day today?  Yeah, it's been extremely difficult.  So just dealing with the fact that I hurt someone or took anything away, you know, from a talented 
[02:57:00]  artist or from anywhere, because I only wanted to help people, you know, my entire life.  I've only wanted to give and do something that I felt was right.  And I immediately knew in this situation that it was wrong and it wasn't a spectacle or just,  you know, it's actually someone's emotions, you know, that I stepped on. 
[02:57:30]  And it was very, it was just, it was rude, period.  I believe him.  What?  I believe him.  Wait, what was he trying to say there now?  He was, he was, he was trying to say in emotional terms.  That I was drunk and did something stupid.  He was trying to find the words.  He was, he's trying to be eloquent, but he was also at the same time, he's emotional.  I fucked up.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean, he didn't mean, I'm telling you, he took the mic off.  He took the mic from her and said, Taylor, nah, it's just cool with you.  And then he, when he starts talking to Beyonce, Beyonce shit is dope, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:58:00]  He's saying, man, that mom, he's saying I fucked up and I'm sorry.  And, and motherfuckers should forgive him because I believe him.  And that motherfucker, right?  You know how paranoid you could be in this game at, and he's at the highest level.  His mom's is dead.  He don't trust nobody.  So this motherfucker got nobody to say, Kanye, you dumb mother.  Don't do stupid shit.  He got no guidance no more.  He's a, he's a goofy motherfucker as it is.  It was just, his, his thought process was horrendous. 
[02:58:30]  But as they said about Plexico, this, this, this, um, sports guy said about Plexico bearers.  He said, you go to jail for being a criminal.  You don't go to jail for being stupid.  And, and he, Plexico was stupid, but you don't, you don't destroy a motherfucker for this.  This is not end of Kanye's career mistake.  He fucked up.  But I'm telling you, it's because who he fucked up with.  He bullied that little girl.  And that's why everybody's all fucked up. 
[02:59:00]  But he should be able to say sorry.  Like if he didn't do anything.  I agree with the sorry thing.  Fuck, I believe him.  I believe that one.  I believe that what he's doing right now.  It's amazing the difference, uh, 60 or so years makes though.  I don't think you'd be hearing from him no more.  Anthony Summers, he wouldn't have been on the stage.  Oh.  No, imagine like fucking, no, no, stop.  Could you imagine like fucking Nat King Cole comes out and fucking, and just snatches  it from Frank, from Anne Francis.  Wait, what's Frank Sinatra's daughter? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking Nancy Sinatra.  And the winner for Boots of Mane for Walking.  I think fucking, you know.  What about, Dionne Warwick kicks your ass.  Fucking Dionne Warwick.  What about Love Child?  Nat King Cole.  Oh, fucking Supremes.  What about Love Child from the Supremes?  They done rushed the fucking stage.  Who gives a fuck about stinking ass boots?  No, I'll let you finish in a minute.  And then he takes some of his congalinas in his air. 
[03:00:00]  And flicks a little in Nancy's face.  Oh, shit.  And fucking, and Sammy Davis is sitting there holding his face.  They done fucked him off.  Oh, God damn.  What about Martha?  Martha Reeves and the Vandellas.  The Vandrells or Vandellans.  Nobody knows anything.  God damn.  Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers.  Connie Francis.  What?  And the winner, Connie Francis.  Thank you so much. 
[03:00:30]  Move, motherfucker.  The Temptations have just took on the stage.  The Temptations.  No way.  And one looks very surly.  Jesus.  Kevin from Connecticut.  It's a work we're all being used.  I don't know if Kanye West would agree to something like that.  I know MTV has done some outrageous things in the past, but that's a rough one to agree  to, that you're going to interrupt a very innocent-looking 19-year-old girl to get everyone talking  about the awards.  I don't know. 
[03:01:00]  He might have did it, but he would have snitched on him.  He would have said MTV condoned, and I told him I was going to do it.  Yeah, because the pressure's pretty intense for him right now.  Yeah, I would have snitched.  He would go, fuck that.  I didn't realize it was going to be this.  Yeah.  That was a stunt.  MTV sat me down and tailed down and said, you know, let's do this thing.  He just did some dumb shit.  Yeah.  Let's get the last clip.  Kanye West on Jay Leno.  So when did you know you were wrong?  Was it afterwards, as you were doing it?  When did it strike you?  Good question.  Uh-oh.  Like, as soon as I gave the mic back to her and then she didn't keep going? 
[03:01:30]  I believe him, man.  But that was MTV's fault because we said this yet.  Were you here yesterday when we were talking?  No, you weren't.  Okay.  MTV had an opportunity there.  That whole thing went down.  I was like, holy shit.  Right?  Ant did a great impression of this yesterday.  The producer behind the scenes in complete panic mode.  They went to a far shot of the stage from way in the back,  so you could barely see her on stage anymore.  Then they cranked the music and turned her mic off.  She was going to continue, which would have been the moment. 
[03:02:00]  Right, yeah.  Of the whole awards.  And I would suggest that producer gets fired.  He doesn't understand, you know, what makes good TV.  She was going to turn that whole thing around immediately.  New producer.  And she was ready to talk.  New producer.  I know.  Cut everything.  Let's get out of this.  Go to commercial.  I know.  They just panic.  Then the house band starts playing,  and she's now standing on that stage really awkwardly,  having her Carrie moment.  Because now everyone's kind of looking at her like laughing at her. 
[03:02:30]  So Kanye, in white people terms, he's saying,  in black people terms, he's saying in white people terms,  I had a douche chill after she was standing there looking stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he's been used to.  He forgot how to be an innocent artist.  He knows how fucking horrible all these motherfuckers are.  So it's no big deal to him.  And then he sees this girl like, oh shit, I'm sorry.  And think about it.  If she was able to continue, then maybe it wouldn't be as bad. 
[03:03:00]  Like if she had said, oh shit, the dude's go Kanye.  Yeah, yeah.  And over.  But poor, she had that poor thing.  I don't know what to say.  All right.  So we continue.  Let me ask something.  I was fortunate enough to meet your mom and talk with your mom a number of years ago.  Oh boy.  What do you think she would have said about this?  Oh shit.  Jay's great. 
[03:03:30]  I like that.  I like that fucking.  I like that.  Jay fucking got it right out of him.  I fucking like that, man.  His mom's died and shit.  He loved his mother, man.  What the fuck would your mother say?  That's what Jay's saying.  What would your mother say about that?  Jay goes, what the fuck would your mother say?  His mother would have said, sweetie, are you stupid?  And he has no one to go, sweetie, are you fucking stupid?  Right, right, right.  What would your mom say?  The fuck are you.  And he's like.  That's terrible.  And then he goes.  Yeah.  He started.  We're getting to that part.  He started.  And I'm not even mad at Jay for that because Jay is berating him. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But also being real cool about it.  Under the guise of an interview.  But he's like calling him a dick, but he's trying to make himself feel like a dick.  And you know what I realize about white people, though?  All you really want us to do is say sorry all the time.  No.  I apologize for it.  No, Anthony.  I apologize.  More than an apology.  I apologize.  Look at Michael Vick.  How much more apology could this nigga do?  Can we?  Oh, my God.  You can't apologize to every dog he ever sees now. 
[03:04:30]  Give me a paw.  Give me a paw.  I'm sorry.  He shakes hands at all every dog.  How much more water is in the contrite well, nigga?  And it's setting up perfectly.  He's going to be the quarterback of the Eagles.  McNabb's already hurt.  Broken ribs.  He's already hurt.  You can't throw with broken ribs.  Nope.  So, I mean, McNabb's going to need a few weeks to heal.  Michael Vick.  Well, they got Colby in there.  I know, I know.  But he'll be gone soon as Michael Vick.  Yeah, but you don't think Michael Vick is already throwing a lot of fucking passes in 
[03:05:00]  the last week?  You don't think he's like...  And he's already laughing at Colb, and he has two new pit bulls that he brings to practice.  Like, I'm going to drown these after my first touchdown.  Fucking the Patriots did all right last night.  That was one of the greatest games I've ever seen.  Buffalo stinks.  Brady was a little scared at first, huh?  He was a little gun shy.  Did you see the whole game?  Yeah, he fucking saw the whole game.  The fumble, though, or saved...  Number 28. 
[03:05:30]  Saved his fucking ass, though.  Number 28 somewhere in the corner.  They locked him up.  He's in the nut house right now.  He fucked up the biggest win of Buffalo's in the last eight years of that team, man.  That was amazing.  Oh, they have 11 points over Buffalo?  11 points in five minutes.  Scored, had two minutes left.  This asshole thinks about...  Mistakes make me sick.  Like, for myself, when you fuck up and you look back and you go,  all I had to do was not do what I did and my life would have been better. 
[03:06:00]  He comes out the end zone and fumbles.  He should have stayed in the fucking end zone, man.  Damn that fucking dude.  And what about that pass Brady made?  What the fuck?  Brady's a beast, man.  What do they call that pass?  It's a type of pass.  Brady won.  Nigga, he's a quarterback.  Is it the hell, Mary?  No, no.  There's a certain pass.  Oh, post, post, post.  In the middle.  It was ridiculous.  How many yards was it?  No, about 20, 25 maybe, something like that.  It was amazing, man.  Yeah.  Fucking amazing, dude.  With two minutes left, not even. 
[03:06:30]  God, that was great.  It was less than two minutes.  That was great.  First fucking game in, I think they said, 54 weeks.  More than a year.  I don't know how that's possible because it should be 52 weeks, right?  And they wouldn't pay Castle.  They said, look, if Castle thinks that the boy that was playing last year,  if you think he's going to get credit, you're his backup.  Here's how much we think you're his backup.  We'll trade you.  Get out.  Great for the fucking Patriots.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That was a great game, man.  That was amazing.  What was the second game? 
[03:07:00]  I don't even know.  Oakland and San Diego was also a good game.  Yeah, I couldn't stay up for that.  Nah, but.  All right, let's get back to Kanye.  Getting ready for the big moment.  Yankees, what?  Dude, I told you.  F baseball.  Football started.  Fucking Yankees.  Yeah, baseball season's over when football starts.  Baseball's the fluffer for football.  Anyone knows that.  Switchalicious.  If baseball gets your dick hard, it jerks you off until football gets in so you can calm down football.  Fucking Yankees are number one.  Yankees are number one, but they still have a whole month left. 
[03:07:30]  But they're fucking cranking.  Yeah, but they could lose in the first round.  They had like double-digit victories.  That don't mean shit.  Cranking?  They could win.  They could lose in the first.  They're fucking smacking the ball.  You don't have a football house.  I'm disgusted.  No one comes over to your house.  You go, hey, guys.  Hey, you guys want to get together and watch baseball all over my house?  How about you want to get together and watch any football game?  The Seattle Nuffins versus the fucking Denver horseshits.  And you watch it. 
[03:08:00]  That's how football is the shit.  Do you understand?  We wait two months.  It's two months of pain waiting for football to start again.  That's a silly preseason crap.  Here's how great football is.  They're thinking about just making it 18 games.  Oh, I know.  And they should.  And say, fuck preseason.  They really should.  Why not?  You know?  Telling you, dude.  It beats the motherfuckers up, right?  Isn't that it?  Yeah, preseason they get hurt.  It beats them up.  When football starts, it's very easy.  There's about four cities that still care about baseball.  Really?  New York, Boston.  New York, Boston. 
[03:08:30]  Detroit, Chicago.  Chicago does.  Philly.  Been down there.  Been to Philly a few times.  Trust me.  Philly is a sports town.  A lot of those Philly fans, even though the Phillies are doing amazing.  And Cleveland is a sports town.  Because they got fucking Martinez, you cocksuckers.  Cleveland is a sports town and Philly is a sports town.  Philly is a big sports town.  What the fuck?  Pedro Martinez is what?  5-0 for the Phillies?  What's the biggest TV you got at your house, Ant?  I don't even know.  It's an 11-foot wide screen in the theater.  You don't know?  It's 11 feet wide. 
[03:09:00]  11 feet?  11 feet.  We don't measure our TVs, Bobby.  It's a theater.  We just watch them.  Yeah.  Konta?  Konta?  What's your TV measure?  Let's do a...  Don't eat us.  Let's measure 11 feet wide.  You know what, though?  I'm going to go cut a swastika right in your screen.  Cut it.  A swastika.  He'd leave it.  Oh, you know what?  What the fuck?  The Eagles did sign Jeff Garcia.  Yes, you're right there.  Chester is over.  I'm sorry.  Jeff Garcia? 
[03:09:30]  The Eagles guy?  Yeah, but he's not...  He's not...  What do they say?  They're using the other guy.  I don't know the other guy.  Kolb.  Kolb, right.  They're using him before Jeff Garcia, but they did sign him just in case.  But Yankees have a chance to win 100 games.  That's pretty fucked up.  I know.  They're fucking...  They really are an amazing team this year.  Who fucking cares, Anthony?  Football's going on.  Talked that shit a month ago.  A month ago?  I didn't think the World Series happened yet.  What happened?  Nobody gives a shit. 
[03:10:00]  No one cares about a Yankees World Series.  The World Series comes on at 1 in the afternoon on a Wednesday.  Stop it.  Nobody gives a shit.  No one cares about a Yankees.  They can't sell commercial space for that shit.  No one cares until my team, the Mets, are in it.  They should have won it nine years ago.  The busted Mets.  They're fucking all busted up Mets.  Stinks.  I hope the Red Sox beat you.  Shut up.  Commentators for baseball are the best because they can make that boring sport interesting.  They're like seven and a half.  All right.  Games back.  Eight.  Eight when they lose today.  They're not going to lose today. 
[03:10:30]  They're four in the wild card.  They're two games fucking ahead in the wild card or something like that?  Four.  Sorry.  Four.  That sucks.  Sorry.  I don't really...  Every game in football counts.  He taps on the fucking wild card.  16 games.  Okay.  Patriots didn't make it to the playoffs last year.  Don't fucking cocky.  You know what their record was?  11 and five.  Mm-hmm.  You play 197,000 games and who gives a shit?  197.  If you...  They'll never do this.  Who the fuck cares?  Patrice has the prettiest eyelashes I've ever seen on a man. 
[03:11:00]  I use Latrice.  Dude, what the fuck?  I use Latrice.  Patrice uses Latrice.  I use Latrice.  They're un-fucking-believable.  Thank you.  Look at them.  They're pretty.  They're fucking gorgeous.  They're fluttering.  They're almost hypnotizing.  Baseball would never do this, but if they just knocked their season in half, made it  80 games...  A third.  Even a third?  Why can't baseball play one game a week for 16 weeks like football?  Because it's not as physically arduous. 
[03:11:30]  Even a bad football game, you've got some great-ass plays.  Who even...  If you don't watch...  Listen, if you don't watch football, you understand, okay?  If you don't watch football, here's what you understand.  The numbers.  You go, hey, you only play 16 games.  Wow.  So their record is 10 and 6?  That's not a good record, is it?  Or 9 and 7?  But I don't watch baseball, so I don't know if 89 and 72 is a good fucking record.  Who the fuck cares? 
[03:12:00]  Okay.  The Mets are doing good now.  Their record is 75 and 75.  I don't know if they can make...  It fucking stinks.  You like basketball?  I love basketball.  Well, then what's with the fucking score?  Same thing as what you're talking about.  Oh, shit.  Some game that they have scores in the hundreds.  Shut the fuck up.  Then what makes it interesting?  At two points a clip, sometimes three.  The only emotion in baseball...  It's got a point.  The only emotion in baseball...  What are you up to, 70 points? 
[03:12:30]  The only emotion in baseball is a fucking...  In the park home run.  In the park home run?  You don't like them?  Wait a minute.  A grand slam or a walk-off home run?  Other than that, where is the tension?  There's just...  First of all...  Every bat.  How about that fucking...  No one's supposed to play a sport for 25 years.  There's 40...  Wait, Derek Jeter's still in the prime of his career.  Yeah.  He's 47.  He's 47.  He's 35. 
[03:13:00]  You know, but that's...  Go fuck out of here, man.  That's a terrific point right there.  That is a good...  He's making a valid point.  You should be able to play professional sports eight to maybe push 12 years.  Maybe.  You're making a valid point.  Maybe.  Why do I have to see Derek Jeter since I was 12, and he's just coming around the bend  on his career?  Get the fuck out of here, man.  Baseball stinks.  No.  Football is the greatest sport going on right now.  What about...  No, no, no. 
[03:13:30]  What about at the end of someone's baseball career, he's the designated hitter and gets  up there for one at bat...  Still.  ...maybe once every two weeks?  Big Papi is just an old, fat Dominican man.  He wears his straw bandana hat when he comes on now.  And swings and misses maybe.  And here's another thing about baseball, why it sucks.  There's no other sport where you do something three out of ten times and you're a fucking 
[03:14:00]  Hall of Famer.  No other sport where all you have to do is, out of ten balls thrown to you, hit it three  times!  If I shot ten free throws and hit three, I stink!  You would be playing in Europe.  If I threw three passes in football, I mean, ten passes and only three were caught, I fucking  am looking for another job. 
[03:14:30]  I'm not in the Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  I'm not in the Hall of Fame.  Baseball is, I just, I don't get it.  I hate baseball now.  Wow.  Baseball stinks.  He's converted me.  You know something?  I love watching the game.  Do you ever watch a whole game though, Anthony?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you sit there and watch?  You don't nod off in the middle of it?  No, no.  I've been watching every Yankee game.  There's nothing more peaceful than the background noise of a baseball game.  Just the fans doing nothing.  Where you are actually on the field, like a right fielder, before the pitch, he can actually 
[03:15:00]  be out there with his hands in his pocket.  Yeah.  Well, they are all leaning on, they're holding their knees most of the game.  Pitchers in baseball make $100 million.  They're important, but they only pitch one every five games.  They only have 30 out of the 212 games they play.  Because they'd rip their arms off.  They're throwing 100 miles an hour, half these guys, and their arm would literally rip off 
[03:15:30]  their body.  Can you imagine how easy it is?  It's a human being throwing 100 miles an hour.  Yeah, yeah.  That's amazing.  That is amazing.  That is amazing.  And the way they do it is so, I'm exaggerating for the point, but 98.  So, that's crazy.  Doing that 100 pitches or 80 pitches a game, your arm would fall off if you pitched it.  And back in the day, they used to pitch, Satchel Paige used to pitch like two games straight,  didn't they? 
[03:16:00]  Back in the day, the pitches used to just...  Oh, yeah.  They pitched a lot more, much more frequently or whatever.  Football is tremendous.  What about ice hockey?  I know it's not a black man's sport for the most part.  I used to sell peanuts and popcorn at the Boston Garden.  Fucking hockey.  Hockey rules.  Not good on TV, but be in there.  Here's what hockey is.  If you learn the rules of a hockey game...  See, even knowing the rules...  Like, a buddy of mine, Matt Frost, he's a big baseball fan.  Huge.  And I want to go...  Listen.  I said I'm going to go to a baseball game, and I want him the whole game to tell me how 
[03:16:30]  to stay interested in this game.  Like, how...  Okay, show me the rules and what's going on.  ...and that I should go, oh, wow, this is good.  Well, when my brother at hockey...  Can I interrupt you?  ...has out of bounds.  There's rules.  I used to think it was just...  No.  ...of a small, that stupid puck sliding, and then guys face off.  You know, but when you know the rules, it's an interesting game.  That's a good point, too, because I hated fucking NASCAR.  I'm not all in, trust me. 
[03:17:00]  Okay.  My brother is all in.  Brett, who owns FH Reilly's, loves his NASCAR.  When he sat me down once, I was over his house, and he explained, like you were just  saying, the strategy of what these guys are doing on the track, it made it way more interesting  to watch on TV.  Yeah, but all these...  Way more.  All these games were invented with some dumb guys in a field going, what do you want to  do?  I don't know.  Kick this around.  Throw it.  All right, this is the rule.  All right, now they...  Throw it.  They just kept making up rules.  All right, dude, if you go past that tree, then that's out of bounds. 
[03:17:30]  We'll call it a touchdown.  I mean, all this stuff was made with just bored douchebags.  Right.  So it's all originated from just stupid shit.  There's no rhyme or reason to do it.  I think about football, it's just men trying to take your face off with strategy involved.  Yeah, but they're only playing 30 seconds, maybe 20 seconds, and then they get a break.  How about every 20 seconds you run down the hallway and I hit you in your chest, and then  we do it again.  And you're hoping it doesn't cause a heart attack.  Sounds kind of stupid, if you ask me. 
[03:18:00]  The whole fucking game sounds stupid.  They're all stupid.  Basketball's a peach basket.  You know, you're shooting a ball in a peach basket, but at the end of the day, the enjoyment  of it is...  Baseball, I don't understand how it's such a wonderful sport.  I don't understand how soccer doesn't take over baseball in terms of the excitement of  it, what they're doing.  It's boring.  Soccer's boring.  Soccer's not a boring sport.  Soccer is like, it's hockey, it's hockey, it's hockey with feet.  You score one, one, one, one nil, fuck that. 
[03:18:30]  That stinks.  One nil.  Stupid fucking game.  The field's too big, the fucking goal's a giant.  Rugby should be the second best.  Like, rugby should take over baseball.  Rugby should be on...  Naked men playing football, fucking each other up.  Rugby's a badass sport.  Rugby should be on TV where soccer is.  Get rid of the soccer coverage and put some rugby games on.  Yeah, rugby's a fucking great game.  I'd watch rugby.  I even like cricket better than baseball, because the way they throw the ball, at least  they throw it with some kind of interesting... 
[03:19:00]  They fling their arms around twice.  When I watch these fucking 18 dykes play women's softball, it's fantastic.  18 dykes.  Can you believe she throws a bowling ball at 87 miles an hour underhanded?  Fucking bitch.  Those little fat girls.  I'll tell you, we gotta get to the Kanye West thing.  I'll tell you one thing about hockey, though.  Oh, shit, I forgot about hockey.  Is that what we were talking about?  Yeah.  What happened?  One more thought on hockey.  Hockey's the first sport where the players are getting too good for the sport. 
[03:19:30]  Oh.  What does that mean?  They're too big.  For the environment, you mean?  They're too fast.  Yeah.  Like, they gotta make the fucking...  Half the game, I'm starting to lose a little interest.  Half the game, it's just...  It's overcrowded, and there's a lot of luck involved in hockey now.  A lot.  There's no...  I don't know what they're gonna do.  I mean, I think it's obvious they need to, like, maybe make the rings bigger, so you  got some room to skate.  They can't skate anymore for the most part.  Yeah, they're playing at Fenway Park this year.  We're going this year.  Someone better get me fucking tickets. 
[03:20:00]  I'm there.  I got tickets.  For real?  No.  Fucking bought that one, too.  Here's Kanye West on Leno.  The breakdown.  Let me ask something.  I was fortunate enough to meet your mom and talk with your mom a number of years ago.  What do you think she would have said about this?  Um.  Um.  Sound like Kermit.  Mom.  Would she be disappointed in this?  Would she give you a lecture?  She's turning the screw.  I don't know if knew we had him.  Yeah, you know, obviously, you know, I deal with hurt and, you know, so many, you know, 
[03:20:30]  celebrities, they never take the time off.  And I've never taken the time off to really, you know, just music after music and tour after  tour and tour.  And I'm just ashamed that my hurt caused, you know, someone else's hurt.  My dream of what award shows were supposed to be caused, you know, and I don't try to  justify it because I was just in the wrong.  That's, that's period, but I need to, after this, take some time off and just analyze how 
[03:21:00]  I'm going to, you know, make it through the, the rest of this life, how I'm going to improve.  And because I am a celebrity and that's something I have to deal with.  And if there's anything I could do to, to help Taylor in the future or help anyone,  I like, because, you know, I, I want to, I want to live this thing.  It's hard.  You know, it's sometimes, so.  Hey, listen, thanks for coming here and thanks for doing that.  You ready to sing?  Ready to sing. 
[03:21:30]  Give it a shot.  It's like when American Idol kicks the people off and they're all crying and then you have  to sing that last song.  And then they got to sing their last song and they got to sing their way off.  Leno was cool, man.  Leno, Leno was trying to help that motherfucker, man.  I like what Leno did.  But Leno got, what do you got?  Hugh Grant, what do you got?  Caught with a prostitute.  Yeah.  And now he's got this.  Because he's a dude.  See, Leno's a, you can tell he's a fucking dude, man.  I disagree.  Who's a dude?  I think the whole Leno thing is very, very simple.  Kanye West people got to Leno and go, look, we're going to cancel this.  This is not good. 
[03:22:00]  You know, we want to just like disappear for a while.  And I bet you Leno gave him a little promise.  Like, look, I'm going to like treat this with respect and we're going to do this thing.  Leno has never been in the middle of controversy in terms of being a hardcore asshole.  But I mean, Leno started the new show.  I bet you he had to, you know, to agree to some things to, you know, get the booking for  his first show back.  I don't know, man.  He don't need no help.  He's on 10 o'clock.  His show moved up an hour.  And if I was, I'd be mad if I was Conan O'Brien, because really Conan still has the 
[03:22:30]  same exact time he had before.  Yeah.  He didn't get a promotion.  No, he didn't.  Leno moved, everybody moved down.  10 o'clock is going to be the new slot for late night TV.  And I know people are happier about that.  I mean, if it was a new guy trying to do this at 10 o'clock, he would get destroyed.  It wouldn't work whatsoever.  It's Leno, though.  He's an institution.  Now 10 o'clock is the time.  And it's five days a week?  You watch.  They move Letterman up in a few months. 
[03:23:00]  No, Letterman's, he ain't moving up.  No?  They'll move Fallon up before they move.  Yeah.  Yeah, because, I mean, Dave is about done.  He's like 65.  His son is three months, you know.  I think Dave just signed on for another year or two.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  I think I read that.  How long is he going to be around?  I don't know.  There was something else that was big yesterday.  Whitney Houston was talking to Oprah about Bobby Brown.  Really?  Is this worth playing today?  Yeah.  Talking about the drugs and being spit on and being hit by phone books. 
[03:23:30]  What?  What?  Yeah.  She had to downplay her fame, she was telling Oprah, because Bobby was a bit jealous.  Oh, Jesus.  So she had to, like, kind of cuddle him and...  He's a fucking maniac.  And try to make it about him.  When did the drugs start?  All right.  Um, before the bodyguard, we were just, it was very light. 
[03:24:00]  After the bodyguard, I had Chrissy.  It started getting heavy.  Very light with what?  What was your drug of choice?  Cocaine.  Cocaine.  Yeah.  Coal fucking cake!  He liked to drink.  I was a drinker.  The alcoholism, that's an ugly thing.  Either you're going to be a really nice alcoholic or a really mean one.  Mm-hmm.  Or he was really mean.  So his personality would become altered when he drank.  Like, dramatically. 
[03:24:30]  She's snitching him out so she can get her fucking career back on.  I don't think this is news, though.  Like, who didn't know this shit was going on when she got a reality show?  It's news because she hit it the hole, and look at her now.  She got that fucking missing teeth, top, lip look with the drugs and shit.  Crackhead fucking...  Poor Whitney, man.  But she's throwing Bobby under the bus, but that's the deal.  Oh, she looks fucking amazing.  Dude, that should look great.  She's got the crackhead.  Knowing what she's been through?  You don't think Whitney looked great?  They dolled her up. 
[03:25:00]  She's got that crackhead thing going on.  Nope.  She looks like she's going to get a job interview right after women's prison.  Nope.  Fucking Patrice simplifies everything.  How old is she?  40.  Who's that?  That's Wendy Williams.  The monster.  Oh, yeah.  She is a beast.  She's a big girl.  Look at that hand.  But she's running the show now, man.  She is the fucking new Oprah.  I understand.  She is taking Oprah over without a problem, man.  She's a big girl.  You're right. 
[03:25:30]  She's a big girl without being fat.  This Wendy Williams show is ridiculous.  They're pushing it hard.  It's huge.  Dude.  Yeah.  Big.  She caters to gay guys and fat black bitches.  A lot of black bitches.  More Whitney.  Was he violent?  He was afraid to do things with me, like afraid to, because my family was very, very  like, okay, boy, I remember when I told you once, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:26:00]  So it was like he would walk kind of away from it, but emotionally, he was abusive.  He was abusive, yeah.  Physically, no way.  No way.  Oh, no way.  No.  Because, first of all, I was faced with two boys, and I would fight you back.  I would fight you back with anything I could find, you know what I'm saying?  And I had two brothers.  I had family members who were like, brother, don't do it because they won't be able to  find you.  That kind of thing.  So he never touched you?  No.  Never laid a hand on you?  He slapped me once.  Yeah.  You know, but he got hit over the head three times. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Was that you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Because I was like, okay, you're going too far.  Fucking Whitney.  He was funny.  You ever hit you?  No.  She's ghetto.  She's ghetto, too, man.  Oh, yeah.  You can tell.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  I think she's from Englewood, New Jersey or some shit like that.  Is that a badass area?  But she's starting to get that fucking, that Edward G. Robinson voice.  Like, whoopee, what happens?  Drugs do it to you, man.  Yeah.  Something's fucking.  Drugs do it to you.  And she's like, this is the thing.  Apparently she can't sing.  And this is the thing about, like, Chris Brown. 
[03:27:00]  It's like, you got to, I don't know, when did hitting the bitch become bad?  What were you going to say?  I mean, I don't hit bitches, man.  I'm not a girl hitter, but I'm like, when did this become, like, you're finished forever?  If you sock your bitch.  Like, sometimes guys don't have the mental capacity.  Sometimes your girl getting your face to the degree where if you're not mentally strong enough,  all you got is your two hands across her goddamn neck.  OJ.  You know what I'm saying?  OJ fucked it up for everybody. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Now, now, now.  This is what kills me about fucking white people.  No, no.  Two niggas kill white women their whole life.  Othello and OJ.  The only two motherfucking niggas that kill.  And OJ is the poster child for fucking killing your wife.  No, but now what happens is if a woman calls the cops because of OJ.  If a woman calls a cop and says, you hit me, you hit me, you hit me.  How about the two white boys with the same name?  I'm just saying.  I don't understand why.  It doesn't matter. 
[03:28:00]  Why can't it just be any fucking guy that hits a woman or kills a woman?  It doesn't matter.  A white guy, black guy.  Any woman calls the cops.  The cops have to come and take the guy out of the house.  Yeah.  Who says that?  Because of what happened.  Because of the response and her getting killed and all this other shit that happened after.  So a bitch can get me thrown out of my own house.  Yeah, absolutely.  Get the fuck out of here.  Absolutely.  I'm going to have to look that up.  If they come and they see, it's like that weird shit.  Like if me and you get into a fight in the street in New York City, the cops will go to you.  First, they'll beat me in the head. 
[03:28:30]  Then they'll brand me.  All right.  Let me just say, hang on.  Then they'll ask you if you want to own me.  I fucked up.  If me and Anthony got into a fight in New York City.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  If you say, I dropped the charges and I say, I don't want to press charges, then they'll  just leave.  And they'll come up to you and go, if you don't press charges and he doesn't, we'll just leave.  Yeah, they'll leave the law.  They don't want to deal with anything, but they have to.  If you say, I'm pressing charges, then they have to take me.  Yep.  Going backwards a little bit.  The domestic's different.  Jay Leno's ratings.  They got some ratings out already.  Preliminaries.  Preliminaries.  Can I take a guess? 
[03:29:00]  Yep.  100 share.  11.  34.  What is an 11?  11 million.  11 million people.  I say 200 billion.  When Jay Leno did his final Tonight Show last May, that was a huge audience.  I bet he got a 20.  How much higher, percentage-wise, was his first show than his last show?  It was higher.  They're already saying it's higher.  Yeah.  So his last Tonight Show did very well. 
[03:29:30]  His debut on the new show did much better.  How much higher of a percent?  A six.  Six percent better?  Six share.  No, don't go share.  Percentage.  Percentage.  Percentage.  I'd say six percent.  I'd say one.  38 percent higher than Letters' final Tonight Show.  But what was the fucking ratings, though?  We're talking about 10 million viewers.  He got 10 million on his goodbye show. 
[03:30:00]  No, no.  10 million last night.  I'm sorry.  So he only got a fucking, like, what, six million people watched his last Tonight Show?  That's it?  That fucking stinks.  I hope he's going over some stats.  I'm trying to do some math here, you motherfucker.  Now I'm all confused.  That stinks, because this doesn't make sense.  Just make your thinking noise.  38 percent higher than Leno's final Tonight Show last May, which was an 8.8 rating, 20 share, 11.9 million viewers, and a 3.4 rating. 
[03:30:30]  I don't really—that's all confusing to me.  Who got—what's 11.9 last night?  No, the final Tonight Show.  But they're saying last night's show did 38 percent higher, but they're saying that it did 10 million viewers.  Now I'm all fucked up.  So it's not more.  No shit, Sherlock.  But they said it's more.  10 million and 11 million.  I mean, I dropped out of high school. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Hold on.  I'm no good on this.  You never hit a girl?  Ever.  You never, ever raised your hand over a girl?  Not even mushed her.  You never choke her?  Not even mushed her, bitch.  Not even mushed her.  Grabbed her by the elbow or the goon handbook?  Never.  Never.  You never hit a girl?  No.  Nope.  Never?  Nope.  So this means Bobby did, and he wants everybody to join in.  Basically, he needs some fucking woman-beating bitch.  I hit one chick.  I said.  Oh, what'd you do?  And he's going to blame her?  Yeah, of course.  Dude, she fucking kicked me in my neck.  He was really being a fucking bitch, dude. 
[03:31:30]  I just, you know.  I was hanging out, drinking my coffee, and I fucking hit her with the coffee cup.  You're going to do it high.  And I said, and then he gets his mean voice right when he goes, and then I'm like, what  are you fucking doing?  And I'm like, dude, and then he grabbed her.  I never hit a girl.  Ever.  Ever.  I got forced to hit a girl.  Really?  Oh, you're forced.  No one's asking you.  Of course you are.  No one is.  Bobby's leading up to, he's just hoping someone will go, what happened? 
[03:32:00]  No, I just thought, I thought Patrice might have hit a girl.  Never.  Actually.  Never.  Yeah.  I know you would.  I know how to mentally abuse bitches.  I know you would never hit a girl.  Hold on.  I never.  I made a lot cry.  I never hit a girl, but I date raped one.  Jesus Christ.  No, you didn't.  You didn't date rape anybody.  I stuck it in a girl's.  Oh, no.  I, nah.  Date rape.  He's talking about date rape.  I, nah.  Put it in our vagina. 
[03:32:30]  Well, that's what it's called now.  Did you crack a hormone?  Back then it was called she just passed out.  Taking the pussy.  Taking the pussy.  What's wrong with you?  Rape, or as we used to call it, sleep.  I rubbed my, I rubbed my cock in a girl's asshole while she was sleeping once.  Like, in her ass tube.  That would be called, that would be considered date rape now.  She woke up.  Now?  She woke up.  I think at any time that's right.  No, because the, you know, a wife, the whole phrase date rape wasn't invented yet.  A wife couldn't say her husband raped until like fucking 1960 or some shit. 
[03:33:00]  I don't believe in the wife fucking rape thing either, but if you're fucking hanging out  with some chick and you're fooling around and she passes out and you rub your dick in  her ass cheek until you come.  She woke up, though.  That's fucking, pretty much.  Here's my problem.  She woke up.  She woke up.  I'm not saying it's rapey rape rape.  Here's my problem with rape.  She woke up and was pissed.  It's not rapeity rape rape.  Here's my problem with rape.  As a guy that's been fucking put in that position.  Right, right.  I just want there to be rape degrees.  What do you mean?  Like all the difference between jumping out of a bush with a fucking fingernail file and 
[03:33:30]  taking pussy and I'm not sure if there's no means to know exactly.  I hear you.  I'm with you.  Just don't say fucking rape as a sweeping rapeness.  Can I just say something?  Murder has degrees.  Can I say something?  Yes.  Rape does have degrees.  Can I just say something?  No, it doesn't.  Second degree rape.  Third degree rape.  No, it doesn't.  No, no.  Rapeity rape rape.  Rape, rapeity rape.  Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape.  Rape is the big rape.  Rape, rape. 
[03:34:00]  Mr. O'Neil, you're here for rape, rapeity rape rape.  Rape, rape.  How do you plead?  How do we plead to rapeity rape rape rape?  Rape, rape.  What?  You saying I rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape?  Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape.  Oh, shit.  If you're just rubbing your dick in between her cheeks, that is some kind of sexual impropriety 
[03:34:30]  going on.  Can I say something, though?  She went to sleep  And then within five minutes  If I fall asleep, put your dick between my cheeks  Wait a second, within five minutes  She was asking for it, right?  Within five minutes  I didn't know she was really asleep asleep  Her mouth said no, but her ass crack said yes  And then she woke up  So, I mean, what would that be?  I thought she might have been up  Was she into it after she woke up?  No, she was pissed  Because I was trying to put the helmet in her asshole 
[03:35:00]  Like I was trying to mush it in  That's rape, rapity  I went into my hand  You're starting to get more rapity rape  Yeah, and she  She woke up and she was like, what the fuck?  You do commit rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape  No, take away the rape rape  Because after that we got into a fight  And then I ate her pussy later on  Oh, you made it good by eating her pussies  See, a jury would understand that  Yeah, the jury would understand that  Yeah, they'd get that  That's rapity rape with a 
[03:35:30]  Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-rape  Well, he ate her pussy  Dismissed  You don't get to fucking see that happening  Will you plead to the charge of rape, rapity, rape, rape  Rape, rape  Hey, can I plead it down to  Just rape, rapity  Hey, can I plead it down to  Rape, rape, rapey  Rapey to the rape, rape, rapey adult rape 
[03:36:00]  Holy shit  Let's say hi to Victor  Victor in Baltimore  Hey guys, uh  But your honor, she was wet  See  Hey, that's interesting now  That is  Without being crazy  If she  I think it's too late for that  If her pussy's wet, it's okay  I think it's too late for that  Without being crazy, really?  So if her pussy's wet, it's not rape  She has to be totally dry  I am not going there 
[03:36:30]  But I don't fucking know  Rapists have to walk around with lube  That's arousal  You can't go there  Arousal  Wait, wait  Are they bringing Pete Diddy out?  Yes  They're bringing Pete Diddy out  Is he gonna pass by our studio?  I don't know  Are they taking him the back way?  You want Pete Diddy in there?  They took him out the other way?  I gotta take a piss  We ain't getting Pete Diddy  Go get  Patrice, go fucking get Pete Diddy  Patrice can do it  I don't know that nigga  Do we care?  He refers to himself as Pete Diddy  We don't need to hear any more Whitney Houston, right?

He wants to pee and then Diddy  Yeah  Patrice, punchline  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday  In San Francisco
