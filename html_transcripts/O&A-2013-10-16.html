<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a humorous intro mimicking Larry King, followed by vulgar banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  The hosts discussed the Million Man March,  political divisiveness, and how national tragedies temporarily unite the country, criticizing politicians with derogatory terms.  They then analyzed a viral video of a confrontation ("Trumpet Guy") between a street musician and a verbally abusive, short man in New York City, speculating on the aggressor's motivations.  The segment continued with a discussion of a high school honor student suspended for helping a drunk friend, sparking a debate about zero-tolerance policies.  A heated phone call with a high school principal and a teacher ensued, filled with insults and strong opinions on both sides. The discussion returned to “Trumpet Guy”, briefly touching on paying a co-worker (E-Rock), Nirvana's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, and an old Opie mistake.

The show then shifted to a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame discussion, debating the merits of nominees like Sheik, KISS (and their song "I Was Made For Loving You"), Deep Purple, Hall & Oates, LL Cool J, Nirvana, Peter Gabriel, and the Meters, with lengthy tangents on disco, the music industry, and personal anecdotes. A caller, Peter, participated in the debate.  The segment concluded with a preview of "Jocktober," an upcoming Piers Morgan interview, and a bit involving radio hosts Terry Clifford and Jeremy, eliciting strong reactions from Opie, Anthony, and a guest.

The next segment started with a humorous bit about weekdays, leading to mother-in-law jokes and a self-deprecating story about a co-worker microwaving fish. A planned Boss's Day segment was scrapped. A comedic bit featuring a fictional "United Bosses Organization" representative followed, filled with jokes about stealing and Ponzi schemes.  This transitioned to a discussion of a large unidentified sea creature.  A significant portion focused on a dispute over E-Rock's phone expenses while he was on vacation, culminating in Anthony offering to pay E-Rock his weight in quarters.  This led to a physical comedy bit with boxes of quarters brought into the studio.  E-Rock remained dissatisfied.  Finally, Piers Morgan joined the show for a lengthy debate on gun control in America, with Morgan advocating for stricter laws and Opie and Anthony presenting more nuanced counterarguments.

The gun control debate with Piers Morgan continued, focusing on the Sandy Hook shooting, gun sales increases, the Second Amendment, the NRA, and the effectiveness of various gun control measures. Morgan highlighted comparisons with other countries, while the hosts emphasized self-defense and questioned the efficacy of some regulations.  The conversation also touched on violent video games, media coverage of mass shootings, and the cultural context of gun ownership.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the show's format and a humorous aside about the 255 pounds of quarters given to a staff member (and their unhappiness with the payment).

The final segment was interrupted by a fire drill during a live read for Steven Singer Jewelers, leading to on-air antics.  The show then transitioned to Jim Norton's advice segment.  Callers discussed sex addiction (including cuckolding attempts), infidelity (including visits to Asian massage parlors), marital problems (premature ejaculation and lack of intimacy), sexual anorexia, addiction and theft (heroin addiction and theft), sleep problems (sleep apnea), and relationship difficulties. Jim Norton provided candid, often unconventional, advice, frequently mentioning 12-step programs.  The segment concluded with an advertisement for a Russell Peters Netflix special.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  How's it going?  How the ice is?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  It's time to find this offensive.  Just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  We're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Not enough of this palaver! 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah!  Bye!  There we go.  Morning.  There it is.  The Million Man March was 18 years ago?  Holy mother of God.  I'm just looking at some of the shit we could talk about today.  That's 18 years ago?  No way.  I'm glad we're more united today than we were then.  Absolutely, Anthony.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Indeed he do.  And wasn't it...  Wasn't it the couple thousand man march?  Yeah, there's always been a little controversy as to how many people actually showed up to that. 
[00:02:00]  They didn't make a million, I don't think.  They didn't make a million.  It was pretty impressive around the reflecting pool and whatnot.  I'm kind of thinking.  No.  Oh.  It's controversial.  Oh.  We're not scared of controversy, right?  It has our name written all over it.  This country's so fucked up and the government's so fucked up.  We kind of need some kind of disaster to bring everyone back together. 
[00:02:30]  Man, that's terrible when you say things like that.  Well, that's how sad the country is, though.  And that's how sad the government is.  That that's what brings people together.  It takes something like that.  I'm not saying we should have something happen to us.  Absolutely.  Because that's a horrible tragedy.  But why is it that's the only thing that brings the entire fucking country back together for a little while?  It really does.  And then they stop their bickering and their nonsense down there in fucking D.C.  Yeah, it really does kind of unite temporarily. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Everyone pulls together.  I don't know.  Because obviously, you know, the government, they're the ones that make those things happen.  Do they?  Yeah.  Is that what happens, really?  The distraction.  Yeah.  You need the distraction?  That would be handy for, you know, the president to come out and say, well, you know, it's time  to put this aside, in this time of tragedy, we must work together to blah-de-blah. 
[00:03:30]  And then all of a sudden, everyone comes together.  You sign all the little things that need to be signed.  Well, what it does, it gets all these blowhards off your TV.  Blowhards.  That's all you hear every night.  Blah-blah-blah-blah.  Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.  It really is fucking exhausting.  Look, the live news shows have just begun, and I already see blowhards.  And a well, by the way, over here. 
[00:04:00]  And a big bitch over there.  They're just a bunch of blowhards that don't listen to you.  Wow.  It's my turn.  Blah-blah-blah.  We're just playing partisan politics.  All I'm going to do is kick the can down the street a little more.  It's the GOP is the problem.  It's the Democrats.  The Democrats, while the president's lapdogs are saying that...  And that motherfucker is serving soup when he should be in the White House. 
[00:04:30]  Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.  All right, the pizzas are here.  Let's all calm down.  The news is covering the pizza delivery here.  Or take pain or can't do his job.  Well, Reed is the problem because he won't listen to Reed's.  Blowhards.  Stupid blowhards.  It means nothing just because you're on TV saying something.  It really has.  That Ted Cruz, I gotta say.  He started his whole mess.  It's gotten to the point where you just can't fucking even... 
[00:05:00]  I hate them all.  You can't even look at either side and go like, yeah, I'm for that.  Right.  It's just this giant clusterfuck of egos.  Right.  And manipulation, posturing for the next election.  All the shit that really doesn't have anything to do with the best interest of the people of this country.  What?  Or the country.  But that's why they're down there.  For our best interest, Anthony Cumia.  Of course.  Of course.  They're representative of the people.  Burr, burr. 
[00:05:30]  Well, you know.  Burr, burr.  Every other guy looks like they're going to have a heart attack at any fucking moment.  They're all stressed out.  Well, we're hopefully optimistic that something can be negotiated in the...  And then you turn on Al.  The white man!  Another blowout.  Holy shit!  He loves talking about black issues.  Oh, he loves them. 
[00:06:00]  He'll twist any issue around to be a black issue.  Everything is racist with him.  Yeah, yeah.  Or racial, I guess, right?  Until it's a black perpetrator, then it's just that the problem has to be solved.  Right, right.  Like, if it's a black perpetrator, it has nothing to do with race.  It is simply guns or it is poverty.  Yeah, then it's something else.  Right.  And once again, last night, I'll be watching this closely.  Oh, shut up.  Are you, Al?  Way to go, Al.  Okay, Al.  Yeah, he's got to make everything a black-white issue. 
[00:06:30]  Everything.  Just another blowhard.  Just blowhards all over the place.  You don't give a fuck what side you're on.  They're all a bunch of blowhards.  And they're blowhards because they don't listen to each other.  No.  You can see them just waiting.  Waiting for their turn.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then, whoa!  Today's a sad fucking day.  I've got to pay E-Rock today. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, man.  Is that really going to happen?  E-Rock, it's going down today, buddy.  That's great.  It's going down.  Are you going to accept the money?  Are you going to say no thank you?  I will accept the money.  You son of a bitch.  Be the bigger man and turn it down.  You son of a bitch.  I'm already the bigger man.  I'm not turning it down.  Oh, damn.  Whoa.  A little self-deprecation never hurt.  It's got me by the balls.  It's a good one.  I fucked up bad.  Yeah.  I still want an apology because I really think that you thought I did it on purpose, giving  out your phone number.  That is true. 
[00:07:30]  And I truly did not.  And I do feel bad about it.  And I talk about how people say, I accept responsibility, but then there's nothing that  happens.  Yeah.  As long as you say, I accept responsibility, I guess that's good enough.  But I've never felt that.  So I feel like I have to do something.  So today it goes down.  You know, it's under my watch.  I accept responsibility.  All right.  And then nothing happens.  So you should get a bare bottom spanking in front of the nation.  Like caning.  Right.  A little Singapore caning.  I would love to follow up the guys that say, I accept full responsibility. 
[00:08:00]  I accept full responsibility.  This is done under my watch and nothing happens.  Nothing happens.  It's that goddamn Muslim we have in the White House.  Jesus.  I saw a pretty funny video though.  Did you see, I mean, they're always looking at fucking Obama.  Did you see the video of Obama shaking a white guy's hand and then a black guy's hand?  No.  I think it was Kevin Durant.  NBA All-Star.  Was he like?  It's hilarious. 
[00:08:30]  Jiving it up.  I don't even know what the event was.  Someone sent this to me.  It was, you know, I should have fucking saved it because I knew we would talk about it.  One of those 20 second handshakes with the black guy?  Slapping knuckles and fucking grabbing fingers?  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  Go back.  Here it is.  Put this on our Facebook page.  And whoever sent this to me, I apologize for not giving you credit.  I didn't realize we were talking about it today.  Are you taking full responsibility?  Yeah.  I guess, I don't even know what the event was, but Obama's going down a line of people shaking  hands.  And watch.  He shakes the white guy's hand.  White guy. 
[00:09:00]  And then...  Watch this.  Nice white handshake.  Money, money, money.  He goes in, comes way back, slaps hands.  With Kevin Durant.  And comes in for the shug.  And then they do the shug.  Oh, how great is that?  Obama's a nerd.  That's what it is.  Of course he is.  He likes that these sports guys like him.  He's just a nerd hanging out with athletes.  He's a nerd.  Yeah, he's a dork.  Yeah.  A dork. 
[00:09:30]  The president's a dork.  He is a dork.  Intellectual fucking phenom.  Dork.  You see the picture of Bill and Hillary?  Bill's holding like a soccer ball.  Really?  And Hillary's laying on the grass and stuff.  Right.  It was way back fucking.  And they're teens, it looks like.  She loves having her face in the grass, by the way.  Oh, is that it?  Loves it.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, well.  With no balls in sight.  I retweeted it last night. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah?  Because it's somewhere on my tweeter.  Your tweeter?  My tweeter.  Oh.  Twitter.  Yeah.  I was like, my tweeter.  Uh, Hillary, uh, had some pretty nice tits back then.  No.  I swear.  Oh, come on.  Look, look, look.  Oh, all right.  Blow that up a little.  Okay, I see what's going on here.  Blow that up and check out Hillary's tits.  They're pretty fucking, like, look, right?  Wow, they've been together that long?  I don't know.  Holy shit.  Her legs look good there and fucking her tits look good. 
[00:10:30]  She looks all right, man.  Like those fucking tits.  And Bill already had his thick thighs, even though he's a thin guy.  He knows it's going to be a problem.  No, he's got the thick thighs already.  Oh, I know.  He knows, like, he's going to have a problem with diet.  Hillary, dare we say, looks pretty damn sexy there.  She looks pretty good right there.  I want to see the face, though.  Wow, she already has old woman face, though.  Yeah, she kind of looks a little funny.  Oh, my God.  The curly hair makes the woman look really old. 
[00:11:00]  The perms are terrible.  Her face already looks old.  They're probably only in their 20s there.  That body ain't too shabby right there, right?  Not bad.  Nice fucking thighs, man.  I bet your shoes are goer.  Look at those legs.  They're little short shorts.  Is that the bottom of the picture, or did you not scroll down all the way to see her ass?  They didn't include her ass?  Who took that fucking picture?  I know.  That's stupid.  Look how shitty the field is they're playing in.  Where is it?  Arkansas?  Yeah.  That's before they got to that Monday. 
[00:11:30]  Cold Hope.  Shut up.  You believe that that's one of the most powerful couples in the last fucking 50 years on Earth?  And they were just hanging out like fucking, like, what happened right after that picture  was snapped?  Did he fucking stick his dick in her mouth?  She probably sucked it behind that tree in the background.  He's holding the sucker ball right in front of his wiener.  Put the picture up.  Put the picture up on the fucking website.  I'll pay you rock like next break or something. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Let us enjoy our fucking breakfast, all right?  The ceremonial fucking paying.  Yeah.  And that'll be the end of that shit.  Did we announce the amount?  No.  Not yet.  Oh, I can't wait to find out.  I don't even know what the amount is.  I thought long and hard what would be long and hard.  More than acceptable.  Oh, so you didn't necessarily give in to his demands?  No.  Good for you.  Why would I do that?  Good for you.  Eight bucks.  Somewhere in between.  Yeah.  Somewhere in between what's right?  Yes.  He'll be happy in the end. 
[00:12:30]  But I crunched my own numbers.  Oh.  And there's a...  And I came to a fine conclusion.  That'll be just fine.  That'll suit him just fine.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I have no doubt.  He'll be very happy.  He'll get his just desserts.  That's right.  We got to October, by the way.  He's got a lot of that.  We got to finish the Terry Clifford shit.  Oh, yeah.  And then we got to do Trumpet Guy.  What do you want to do first?  Oh, man.  I love Trumpet Guy.  There's so much great stuff today.  That is a typical New York fucking scene right there. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  A few people want to think it's fake.  Oh, no way.  You walk around New York enough, there's a million of these type of fucking trolly people  that aren't scared of shit, and they're just raging assholes.  This guy, and I tweeted it, he looks like he should have been thrown off a mountain in  Sparta at birth.  He's a little troll.  He can't be more than four.  I'll give him 4'10", maybe.  Maybe.  His pants are pulled up to his fucking nipples. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  He looks like Bob Eatman and Danny DeVito.  Yeah, yeah.  If they had a kid.  Yeah.  There's almost a, if no one knows Bob Eatman, I mean, like a Paul Simon, Danny DeVito thing  going on, too.  Yes.  Kind of a...  You ever see a picture of young...  Squirrely, wormy guy.  ...of young Bob Eatman?  No.  What did he look like?  Was he dreamy?  He's pretty dreamy.  No way.  He did all right. 
[00:14:00]  I think he might have put up numbers.  Did he put up numbers?  No way.  Yeah.  Probably just showed you a picture of someone else who was good looking.  Yeah.  It's not him.  He looks like a young Dustin Hoffman.  All right.  I could probably see that.  Yeah.  If Bob is listening...  Ha, ha, ha!  That'd be hilarious.  He should...  There's a picture in his house of him looking like a young Dustin Hoffman when he was like,  I don't know, in some dumb orchestra somewhere in the world.  Playing his dumb fucking coronet. 
[00:14:30]  I think he was in Israel.  Well, that would make sense.  He was traveling and doing orchestra or something with his French horn, but...  Oh, French horn.  That's it.  There's a picture in his house where he absolutely looks like a young Dustin Hoffman.  Ooh.  Did he have the same hair?  Like, is it the...  The same hair?  I mean, is it...  When did he have hair?  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  Was it all the president's men, kind of a Dustin Hoffman?  Oh, yeah.  He had a lot of hair.  Or was he pissing his pants on a bus to Florida?  Yeah.  Yeah, he looked like a ratso. 
[00:15:00]  Well, there's ratso right there.  So the trumpet guy.  So I guess...  He's kind of like a ratso.  Yeah.  I'm walking here.  This guy rules.  He rules because he's such an idiot, by the way.  He's a douchebag.  What he does, what he did here, you know, he doesn't rule for that.  I'm a fan of the street musician Anthony Cumia.  Are you?  I give money to every single one I see.  I despise them.  Of course you do.  If I got a quick fiver in my wallet, the street musician gets it every time. 
[00:15:30]  Wow.  No.  Fiver.  I try for fivers.  That's nuts.  If I don't have a fiver, I don't go 10.  I don't go 20.  Then I'll dig a few dollars.  Or some change at the very least.  But I try to go with the fiver.  That's my thing.  If I'm walking around the city...  You don't like these guys.  No.  But if I'm walking around the city and I've been, like, hanging out, maybe I've been to  a couple of bars and stuff, every so often, very rare, maybe every couple of months,  Yeah.  I'll see a homeless guy that I deem worthy of my assistance, and I'll drop him a C-note. 
[00:16:00]  Whoa.  Just to watch their fucking face.  I'll drop him a C-note.  Go like, here you go.  Did you see that shock look?  They have to fit the criteria.  Yeah.  And you almost...  You do it for, like, your amusement.  I do it for my amusement.  Yeah.  I gotta be honest.  I do do it for my amusement.  But it's also, you know, it makes me feel good that I can.  The look of shock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They look like they can't believe it.  They're very happy.  What do you do if you can't find a homeless guy? 
[00:16:30]  Do you find a listener of our show and then just say something pleasant?  No.  I never say anything pleasant.  They're your little playthings, it looks like.  Yeah.  You know, it's just kind of a fun...  Who cares?  The end justifies the means, right?  It's an exercise in objectification, not...  Well, we could all sit there and go, when we do good things, is it for our own pride  or is it for fucking, you know, doing good?  And I think a lot of times when you do something charitable, there is a feeling that you get  like, oh, I'm a good person.  So, you know, there before the grace of God, stop throwing fucking rocks in your glass house, 
[00:17:00]  you cocksucker.  Whoa.  You're right.  I don't have $100 anyway, so...  Of course you don't.  It's not about you, Sam.  It's about the trumpet guy.  You're right.  You're right.  Did you take this video?  Oh, I wish.  Are you kidding me?  It would not have been in portrait.  Thank you, Anthony.  Please.  He's a professional.  And I would have edited this.  This thing is way too long.  As you see, we're going to start the tape halfway through the video.  Right, where he starts coming over to the camera guy.  What you see is the troll way in the background, yelling and screaming at a trumpet player who's 
[00:17:30]  like just a street guy trying to make a few bucks.  And this guy just fucking, I don't know.  It awoken something in him.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, this guy, I guess, is a failed musician himself.  That's what I get out of this.  I totally got that.  Especially by the end of this clip when he's berating the horn player.  It's like, oh my God, he's definitely just talking to himself now.  This is a fucking monologue he's having with himself about how awful he is. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I tweeted it.  And I think it's on our Facebook page by now, right, Ira?  Okay, it's up there.  So you should like our Facebook page.  That would be nice.  Like it.  A lot of our visuals go right up there so you can play along at home.  All right.  So we pick it up halfway through the video now that the troll is moving toward the camera  so you can really hear what he has to say.  Which, when he moves toward the camera and you see him up close, one of the greatest  reveals in viral video history.  Oh, boy, yeah.  You realize how short he is and how weird. 
[00:18:30]  There's something genetically wrong with him.  His torso is only as long as his face is.  Yes.  He's got a tiny torso.  Little tiny torso, big head, big long face.  But huge balls, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he would go down in one fucking punch to the jaw.  And what an annoying voice.  Oh, what happened?  Yeah.  All right, let's play this.  What the hell do you think you are?  You any kind of artist? 
[00:19:00]  Anybody know who you are?  Maybe everybody else wants to enjoy the peace and quiet.  This is one of the most important places in all of North America.  Who are you?  Who are you?  You miserable presumptu is no talent.  You're no artist.  An artist respects the silence.  It serves as the foundation of creativity.  You obviously don't have the talent.  You don't have enough respect for yourself or other people or what it is to express yourself.  In music, really in the form of creativity.  I thought Ronnie James Dio died.  I'm an NYU film school graduate. 
[00:19:30]  Sucker.  Pause.  That looks like Todd Roskin.  What?  It does look like Todd.  It's not Todd, though.  No, no.  It looks exactly right.  It sounds a little bit like Woody Allen, too.  Yeah, a really angry Woody Allen.  Yeah, yeah.  You sure that's just not a really ugly woman?  Because a lot of people think it's a woman.  I thought it was until you said it.  I thought it was like the breasts.  That would be even better.  But I don't think so.  I don't know.  Go back a little bit.  I swear last night watching, I thought it was a woman.  I did, too, for a point.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Because it looks like there's some flatty tits there, maybe.  And did you fuck her?  Oh, I fuck her.  For the story.  Oh, God.  For the story, man.  NYU film school graduate.  Sucker.  Sucker.  School of Visual Arts and the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, you suck.  You are no talent.  If you really have talent, go practice.  And it gets yourself a gig instead of ruining the end of the day for everybody down here. 
[00:20:30]  You disgrace.  You are everything that's gone wrong in this world.  You are self-consumed, no talent, mediocre piece of shit.  And I've earned my right to say it.  I feel like he could be talking to us.  You guys might want to put this audio in the intro.  Oh, this guy's pretty good.  Even for a crazy person, he's well-spoken.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, no, he's well-educated.  Yep.  And so great. 
[00:21:00]  You can tell he's been in New York.  Went to some of the finest schools.  Yes.  You can tell he's been in New York forever because he's using 70s New York slang.  Oh, yeah.  Like, sucker.  Sucker.  You're not a cool cat.  There's a million of these guys, man.  They're all over the fucking place.  The New York trolls.  Oh, boy.  They're the worst.  No talent, mediocre piece of shit.  And I've earned my right to say it.  Okay?  I had two of them in 1975.  I want Bob Dylan up on stage. 
[00:21:30]  Who the fuck are you?  I knew the Grateful Dead from 1966.  Who the fuck are you?  You nothing.  You nothing.  You are nothing.  And you will never be anything.  Never.  Oh, boy.  How dare you.  Who is he talking about now?  How dare you.  You miserable, mediocre nothing.  His cell phone looks next to him. 
[00:22:00]  I know.  His cell phone looks huge.  Look at his side profile.  It looks like Pacino without the wig.  That could be the worst side profile ever.  That is awful.  Holy fuck.  It looked like he pulled an iPad out of his pocket.  He's got a plasma.  I walked Bob Dylan on stage.  I knew the Grateful Dead.  I bet you those things are true.  Oh, I bet they're true, too.  Yeah, yeah.  It's obvious.  He's talking.  This is his inner voice coming out.  Yeah, yeah.  He feels like he is a failure. 
[00:22:30]  Nothing right.  Because the guy he's yelling at is just a dude on the street playing the trumpet.  Like, he never claimed to be anything but a dude on the street who plays the trumpet.  He's not claiming he's a good trumpet player.  He's not claiming that he is this amazing musician.  Right.  But this guy spouted off all of his credits, all the schools he was doing.  And he's the mediocre, useless failure.  Sucker.  Sucker.  You're going to go back a little bit. 
[00:23:00]  Before he pulls out his fucking...  Yeah.  His giant phone.  His jumbotron.  Right.  Immisical, mediocre nothing.  Shame on you.  His rat's stupid little smile.  Your little pip.  No more to play.  No more to play.  You're flat.  You can't even carry a fucking note.  I don't care if it's your little, like, horn lip. 
[00:23:30]  It doesn't mean that you know how to play.  You're flat.  I'm trained classically.  I'm trained contemporaneously.  And you suck.  Go away.  No.  No.  No.  And then he leaves.  That's all the truth was the guy to go, all right, enough.  Enough.  Well, he knew he was getting some good video.  And the guy left.  He goes, no.  No.  And he walks away.  No.  No.  Wow.  He called him a pip. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  He's probably right about the horn playing, too.  Who wouldn't want to talk to a horn player like that?  Who wouldn't want to yell at a horn player?  Oh, that's so annoying.  They're just loud.  Go to the beginning.  You barely play.  It's the funniest part, but it's so far in the distance.  Like, the guy starts...  What the hell is that?  Wrong video, Sam.  It's called Lick My Love Pump.  The guy starts yelling at him.  And then the trumpet player, like, just plays right in his face.  Let's see if this plays well on the radio. 
[00:24:30]  It might not.  He's in the background now.  He's telling him to leave.  Shithead.  Looks like they're recreating the Call Me Al video.  He's playing old Susanna. 
[00:25:00]  Old Susanna.  What a horrible song.  What a great New York scene this is. 
[00:25:30]  Perfect.  Go to a studio and rehearse.  If this was any other city, the cops would have been there.  They would have been a...  And New York is just...  Don't tell the piece of shit.  It's what happens.  You oppose your act of talent and order on everybody around you when they want to do it or not.  Get out.  How dare you come down here and do this.  How dare you.  I'm here 14 years.  I've lived in this time of my home life.  You're a disgrace.  You suck.  How dare you.  I'm a creeper dad.  He's lucky he didn't get that trumpet upside his fucking head.  Who's filming this?  Some passerby or... 
[00:26:00]  Who the hell do you think you are?  Who the hell do you think you are?  Yeah, that's where we picked it up from.  Now, where is this?  Do you know?  This is in the city somewhere.  Yeah, I don't know exactly where.  I believe it, to be real, because the guy who was filming was too scared to keep him in frame.  And he's too good.  You can't...  No, you can't.  You can't reenact that.  If you reenact that, you don't just put it on YouTube.  I don't know.  And we learned that the guy's been playing left-handed guitar for 41 years. 
[00:26:30]  41 years.  Those are just too weird of facts to make.  Even a writer wouldn't come up with that shit.  I brought Bob Dylan on stage.  You'd think of a better credit than that.  I played with Bob Dylan.  Right.  And he knew the Grateful Dead.  Yeah.  From 1966.  Yeah.  It's actually pretty impressive to know the dead back in 1966.  Yeah.  They were probably, you know,  Hey, little man, come over here.  Yeah.  Right.  Good to see you again.  Hi. 
[00:27:00]  Simon, his name was, or whatever.  Hey, Simon, it's you again.  There he is.  They loved him around when they were tripping.  Oh, fuck yeah.  They would drop some acid and have this thing running around.  Oh, yeah.  Time of his life back then.  Sure.  I love when he goes,  You're fucking flat.  You're flat.  Yeah.  Because I'm telling you, he's crazy,  but no way that didn't bother the horn player.  That one probably got to him.  I'm like, fuck you, man.  The horn player has a sense of humor,  because he plays the most hack song ever.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, Susanna.  Poorly.  Right.  He's terrible.  He knew that would really bother him.  Yeah, just another little slice of New York right there.  Yes.  We have Piers Morgan coming in today, too.  There's a new book.  Oh, yeah.  He was really good on our show last time.  Well, a lot has changed since then.  Yeah.  Well, he's dove head first into the anti-gun foray. 
[00:28:00]  He's debated many people on his show about the Second Amendment.  Right.  And I'm going to enjoy discussing that with Piers Morgan.  What side are you going to take?  Are you going to roll over and let him scratch your belly,  or are we going for this today?  I'm going total anti-gun.  Yeah.  I don't like the idea that Americans can have guns.  Could be a good debate, actually.  Yeah.  You should make the worst points ever and just blame Jews.  Oh, that'd be great.  Just keep playing that guy over and over. 
[00:28:30]  It's people like him.  No!  No!  No!  Anyway.  What's going on with the honor student?  You were just telling me about before the show.  I saw the story on The Five yesterday.  I was watching The Five.  What's The Five?  That's the one with Greg Gutfeld.  His show.  It's on at 5 o'clock.  Dana Prino.  Fox News.  Yeah.  Dana and that big fucking lug.  Bob Beckel.  Bob Beckel.  Bob Beckel.  Yeah, Bob Beckel's insane.  You know, I keep forgetting to check out that show. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, it's pretty good.  It's a very loose format.  They just throw around the news and shit like that.  No, yeah, I know.  I hear it's really good.  Well, there's a story on that,  and it made me do a little more investigating online.  I got the story.  This girl, she's going to high school, right?  And she's on the volleyball team.  She's the captain of her volleyball team.  Very good student.  And she gets a call at night from a friend of hers.  Right.  And her friend's like, I'm at this party. 
[00:29:30]  I'm a little fucking hammered.  Could you pick me up?  And the friend's like, sure.  So she drives to this party to pick her up,  and the party gets busted.  And this girl now that was completely sober,  even the cops said that, no, she wasn't drinking at all.  She hadn't been drinking.  She had just gotten there to drive her friend home,  her drunk friend home.  So the school, in their infinite wisdom  and no tolerance policy of any type of drinking or parties 
[00:30:00]  or being anywhere where drinking or drugs are being done in any circumstance  has suspended the girl from her volleyball team  because she was going to pick her drunk friend up.  So they'd rather discourage people picking up their drunk friends  and driving them home by punishing them in some way, shape, or form  than just saying, okay, look at the circumstance,  say that that's a valid reason for her to be there. 
[00:30:30]  I'll make the obvious point now, too.  So now you're just encouraging these students,  if they're fucking drunk, to go drive home  or go drive with their other drunk friends.  Or somebody that would have...  Why would you put yourself in that position, then?  Why would you want to be the Good Samaritan and go,  oh, fuck, my friend's fucked up.  I'm going to go get her.  Yes.  Because everyone's texting their asses off,  so that's an easy thing to do.  Right.  I'll go and pick her up because I'm sober.  It's so unreasonable of the school.  I fucking hate it.  It's unreasonable.  Zero tolerance policies are... 
[00:31:00]  They're horrendous things.  Another dumb policy.  Yeah, yeah.  How about you have a fucking brain and do a case-by-case thing?  Right.  You look at this and say,  well, we don't want to discourage a sober student  from picking up one of their drunk friends.  Right.  Because now you'd be like,  well, I'm not going to do that  if I'm going to get fucking in trouble  thrown off the team or suspended from school or something.  You're not going to take that chance.  No.  So let the friend drive home,  perhaps kill someone else,  kill themselves.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  Unreasonable. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Totally unreasonable.  A lot of these schools are making no sense.  Zero tolerance policies.  Also, when you see a kid  and he's got like a Lego version of a blaster  from a Star Wars little Lego kit,  and he's got it on him,  and he takes it out in school and gets suspended.  Does that really happen?  Yes.  Yes.  Because they have a zero tolerance gun policy.  There's been even more.  A kid bit a bagel into the shape of a gun  and was holding it in the cafeteria  and got suspended for that.  One kid actually just made a gun 
[00:32:00]  with his finger and thumb,  like you would,  and got suspended for that  because there's this zero tolerance policy,  which does nothing for the safety of the students.  It does nothing as far as the real people  walking through the schools  with their fucking guns.  It doesn't matter.  It's robotic and lazy.  It's lazy.  It is lazy.  They don't want to have to tell some parents,  here's why your kid got suspended  and why someone else did  because they're fucking lazy cowards  and they don't want to have to make those decisions  and have those trapping things.  The Lego thing is a quick email. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone's connected with email  through the schools now.  Yep.  So you go,  hey, you know,  we had to take this Lego gun away from your kid  and then, you know,  in the future we'd appreciate it  if you didn't bring it to school.  Right.  That's it.  Yeah.  End of the situation.  Yeah.  There doesn't need to be this suspension  and, oh, God,  when I think of what,  the toys you used to take to school as a kid,  after Christmas.  Oh, my God.  After Christmas vacation, 
[00:33:00]  in elementary school,  you're a fucking kid.  You'd bring in, like,  all kinds of toys  and there'd be guns,  fucking gun toy,  you know, toy guns,  but, yeah,  you'd bring those in,  dart guns,  water pistols.  You can't even have a water pistol  in school on a hot day  and just start, you know,  squirting somebody with it.  You'd get fucking suspended.  Well, you squirt the girls  that have, you know,  the boobies coming in.  Right on their fucking tits.  That's right.  Yeah.  Let's talk to a principal. 
[00:33:30]  It's Bill in Pennsylvania.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Guys, how you doing?  I know.  You sound like a principal.  Yes.  I love the show,  but no,  I'm listening on my way  into school.  And the bottom line is  for athletics  versus school policy,  teams and coaches  have, like,  their own set  of more strict rules  than the actual student  handbook and guide  for parents.  Oh, yeah.  So those are definitely  zero tolerance policies.  For example,  I will not use tobacco.  I will not use drugs.  I will not use alcohol 
[00:34:00]  during the season.  Yeah.  And if I'm caught using that  or if I'm at any event  where that is being used  by my peers,  I understand that I can  be removed from the team.  Yeah.  It's definitely more strict,  and I guarantee that girl  was doing the right thing.  But the one thing  that I learned in my position  is there's two sides  to every story,  and the truth lies  somewhere in between.  So if that girl  just pulled in front  of the house  to pick up her friend,  I think this would be  a totally different story.  Oh.  For sure,  the girl,  hey, I'm sober,  there's this party going on,  I'll go for a while, 
[00:34:30]  and I'll pick up the girl.  You know what?  Jimmy made that point  and we forgot to make it  on the radio.  I made it earlier, yeah.  Sometimes we forget  what made the radio or not.  We were discussing this  before the show,  and Jimmy said just that.  How do we know  that the girl wasn't  at the actual party  and all that shit?  But that doesn't mean  she should get in trouble.  Unless there's proof  that she was,  and the cops even vouched for her  and said that she hadn't  been there for a while  based on what other people  were saying,  and she hadn't been drinking,  even the cops vouched for her,  it should be a case-by-case, 
[00:35:00]  and maybe 99% of the kids  in that circumstance  would be caught lying  or they were drinking  or they were at the party.  But you can't just  suspend this chick for this.  It sends a horrible message  to kids that want to  help their friends out  if they're hammered.  To be honest with you,  that's where school officials  get in trouble.  Whenever they pick and choose  what they're going to address  and how they're going to address it,  that's when they get in trouble.  Well, that's one of the point  I was making.  To me, it's lazy and cowardly 
[00:35:30]  of the school administrators  to not be able to say to a parent,  here's why we did that  for this kid and not for your kid.  It's just lazy.  They're fucking lazy.  That's to save our own ass.  I was going to,  Bill, I was going to defend you  because then you get the parents  that are just,  they can be complete  and utter assholes about it too.  Why my kid?  Why my kid?  And not that kid over there.  Well, you have to be able to,  you have to have a reason for that.  If you make a decision for one kid,  you better be prepared  to make that exact same decision  for another kid in the building 
[00:36:00]  or that's when you get in trouble.  Case by case.  Why is that though?  It should be case by case,  but that's the culture of this shit.  I know.  I like the old days  where the teacher  could backhand a kid  if he was getting out of line  and the parent would get mad  at the kid,  not the teacher.  Smack that kid!  Do teachers all make  the exact same amount of money?  Well, actually,  the way it works  is it depends on,  number one,  your education,  and number two,  your years of experience.  So,  a teacher's pay scale, 
[00:36:30]  it's like a big grid,  and if,  imagine this grid  and down the left-hand side...  Wait, hold on.  I'm trying to imagine.  A grid.  All right, it's,  mine is silver.  Give us a pop quiz on this shit.  It's a silver grid.  I'm seeing it.  Now,  on the left-hand side,  the number of years work,  like a first-year,  second-year,  third-year teacher  going down,  and across the top  at your level  of education.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  so you have  a third-grade education  and you've been  on the job  for a month.  I think you're way  in the upper 
[00:37:00]  left-hand corner.  No,  it's bachelor's degree,  bachelor's plus 12,  plus 24.  I'm a bachelor.  But you see what I mean  is that...  Just so not listening.  I know.  At this point,  he's doing new math  or something with us.  There's a grid  and numbers.  I'm asking because  I'm saying is that  there's...  It's not a zero-one policy.  There's a system  to get to it.  And to me,  it just seems unreasonable  to have a zero-tolerance policy  despite anything  that might make it different.  You know,  and that's what's irritating 
[00:37:30]  and it's robotic.  That's what's frustrating.  I can't say I disagree with you.  And if you're going to tell a parent  this is why we didn't do it  for your kid,  make sure you have  the right reason.  That's all.  That's why I say it's lazy  and the school board  should back you up  against a shitty parent.  But they don't acknowledge  if there are some parents  that make excuses  for their kids  and suck  and they won't acknowledge  and face these people down.  Right.  Yes.  Yeah, well,  I'll tell you what.  I'm fortunate.  I work in a district  where the administrators  above me  and the school board,  they are very common sense  and they are very good. 
[00:38:00]  But at the same time,  a great example,  if a kid comes late  to school so many times  they get a detention.  Now,  does that apply to every kid  or just the kid  who hits your radar  all the time?  For example,  let's say the president  of the school board's kid  he's been coming  to school late  and he gets referred  to the principal  by the attendant's office.  Hey,  this kid,  he,  Oh my God.  Exactly.  It's like being sent  to the principal's office.  Exactly. 
[00:38:30]  We're literally sitting here  getting sent  to the principal's office.  All right,  hold on,  man.  We got a teacher  that wants to talk  to the principal.  This could be good.  You guys don't get along,  right?  Teachers and principals.  I'll tell you what,  I have a pretty good  relationship with the staff.  Oh,  good for you.  Let's say hi to Dan  in Florida.  Who's a teacher.  He's talking to Bill  the principal.  Go ahead,  Dan.  Hey,  Bill.  How you doing?  You just described  a coward.  You said you got it.  You can't go to that  for one kid who's good.  You're hard to pussy.  That's what a pussy does. 
[00:39:00]  Whoa.  Nice language.  I'll tell you what,  a pussy laughs.  You might ask  and sit for one day  in my chair  and we'll see  if you're singing  the same tune.  Whoa,  singing the same tune.  Whoa.  Easy with that  language principle.  You can look out  the singing the same tune.  Wow.  That's how you talk  to a teacher  who's piping up.  Yes.  Wow.  Piping up.  I mean,  the only problem is  that's the reason  everyone sucks  is because you won't  stand up for what's right.  You don't do anything.  You treat the good kids  good.  You treat the bad kids  bad.  Why do you got to go  and just throw anyone  under the bus, 
[00:39:30]  whoever it is?  Be a man.  The school bus.  Take the kids  to do the right thing  and help them out.  Do the right thing.  I'll tell you what,  you're making  some pretty hefty assumptions  for just hearing  one phone call.  The bottom line is  a good teacher  appreciates consistency  from an administrator.  Wow.  Damn it.  This guy doesn't  take any guff.  Damn it.  You just said,  I'll tell you what,  that's why I'm a principal  because I don't take any guff  and I'm not some liberal prick.  Whoa.  You've got to be  a liberal prick.  Think about it for a second. 
[00:40:00]  If you would just stop  and say,  hey, coach,  let them get back  on the team.  Quit being a bitch about it  and let them on  for doing the right thing.  But no,  you're a coward  and you're just going to do,  oh,  I don't want to upset a parent.  Upset a parent  every once in a while.  Tell them to go to hell.  But you won't do it  and so we have to keep  doing the same rotten kids.  Get away with the same shit.  Obviously,  you never sat in a parent  meeting with me, buddy.  But at the same time,  parent meetings?  Not knowing all the information.  This was a coach's decision,  not necessarily  a principal's decision.  That's why she was 
[00:40:30]  kicked off the team  and not defended from school.  Yeah, well,  you're really teaching  the kids of the future.  Don't go pick up  your drunk friend  because I will back you up.  Are you saying that  principals should not  support coaches?  Oh.  Yeah, I was saying  principals should not  support coaches.  Those are my two choices,  huh?  You got me into a corner.  With your semantic arguments,  you can learn a thing  from 13-year-old Jimmy Norton. 
[00:41:00]  You managed to let a kid  off the hook  that's a piece of shit  because there's no rule for it.  But then another kid  who does the right thing,  you're,  well, I can't help you.  I have to treat you  the same as everybody else.  Yeah, where's that  land on your grid?  I agree with what you just said.  Where's that land  on your grid?  Oh, this guy,  this guy's a prick.  Killing him.  He's a teacher.  He has to deal with this shit.  I mean, we do it all day.  We watch principals.  Oh, this rule,  you can't do that.  And then you say,  hey, what about 
[00:41:30]  this other thing  that's not as bad  or that's worse?  Yeah, well, all of that,  there's no rule  in the book for that.  Be a man  and make a rule  that makes sense  that everyone can agree with.  And when the parents say  it's not fair,  tell them to fuck off.  Wow.  Damn it.  That's the right thing to do.  Oh, my kid can't have  everything.  That's all we do.  Oh, one kid has  a peanut allergy  so no one can have it.  Stand up and say sucks.  Be honest.  It sounds to me  like you need to spend  more time teaching  than just sitting around  and trying to supervise  your supervisor.  Whoa! 
[00:42:00]  Fuck!  That right came out  of nowhere.  Damn it.  I'm inviting you  to go get more education  to become an administrator.  Walk one whole school year  in an administrator's shoes  and you'll change  your tune a little bit.  Yep.  I'm inviting you  to stick to the argument  we have instead  of just bringing up  other stuff  so that you don't lose.  If you can answer  anything I've said,  go back to school  and then you'll see  a man.  A man. 
[00:42:30]  Have you ever heard  of a man?  I love this guy.  I wish my kid  was in front of you  so he could adopt  your liberal asshole  opinions all day.  Ooh.  Whoa.  Liberal.  What am I saying  that's liberal?  I'm saying to have  actual fucking balls.  Have balls  and do the right thing.  How do you know I don't?  That's the best question.  How do you know  that I don't?  Because you just said  that you can't do  the right thing every time  because a parent  might come after you.  That's called  being a pussy.  If you saw a kid  hit an ocular  but the kid was bigger than you,  would you back down 
[00:43:00]  and say,  how many high school kids  do you have?  How many high school,  are there 18-year-old  bullies at your school  and they back you down too?  And look at it,  is that a rule of me  to want to stand up  for people who are  doing right there  and the amateur?  Wow,  name calling.  I'm an amateur.  Do a good name  like Pussy.  Try that one  because you're a coward  and you won't.  Damn.  All right.  You don't have to fall  back on.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Harsh words.  From the Teacher's Lounge. 
[00:43:30]  Great debate.  Yes,  the Teacher's Lounge.  That's what you hear  behind that closed door  that says Teacher's Lounge.  A lot of bickering  going on  between the principal  and the teachers.  Wow.  Hey, teach.  Wow,  I thought they all got along.  It doesn't end there.  What?  Now we got a guy  that used to be  on the school board.  Oh, my goodness.  Sean in Houston,  go ahead.  I was in school board.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  I was on the school board  for 10 years  and listening to these  two guys bitching each other  was one of the reasons 
[00:44:00]  why 10 years was enough.  The problem is not  the teacher.  It's not the principal.  They're both dumbasses  are missing the point.  The point is  it's the fucking parents  who think it's my job  as a school board  to raise their kids  and they've turned  their kids over  these schools  and then when you do  actually try to raise  their fucking kids  and you try to do  something about  their discipline  or you do something  about bringing them  up as a good person,  then the backlashes,  which is you can't  discipline my kid 
[00:44:30]  or you can't do this,  you can't do that.  And as far as that  bullshit about  the school board member  or the principal  kid not getting disciplined,  you know,  horseshit.  I held my kid  to a higher example  and I told him,  I said,  if you get your ass  torn up in school,  I promise you  I'm going to tear it up  when you get home.  Jimmy, that's not a remark  for you.  But the point  of this whole thing  is you listen  to that teacher  and principal  go to each other  and they don't realize  they're on the same  fucking side  of this thing  and they're fighting 
[00:45:00]  with each other.  The problem  is the parents.  It's not my job  to raise your damn kid.  You know,  it's my...  All right.  All right.  I guess we...  And Glenn Robertson  says on Twitter  and he's probably right.  Yeah.  If one kid's excused  for something  and he's white  and the next kid  is black  and gets suspended,  they get fired  and the school board  gets sued.  Suspended the sentence.  Or whatever  the situation.  It doesn't have to be  white and black  but that was his example.  But I mean,  there's a point there too  where you make 
[00:45:30]  one exception  then they find out  why their kid  was discriminated against  and then they have  a lawsuit.  Yeah, maybe shitty parents  have just fucking  made this mess.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, fuck that criminal  up there in Boston.  She deserves it.  Damn sober driving punk.  All right,  we're going to  take a break here.  Certainly.  We've got to finish up  a jocktober from yesterday  and then we've got  some bonus jocktober today.  Boner.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  And somebody  has promised something.  Oh, that's nice. 
[00:46:00]  E-Rock gets paid today.  Yeah.  I'm getting out of that  because it's jocktober.  I'm so fucking curious  as to how much money this is  because I know  what E-Rock said it was.  I crunched the numbers.  And I know Opie's...  I used a lot of logic.  That's why it took so long.  I really had to think  this one out.  It's a little lower  than what E-Rock wanted.  And then I needed  a few days to go by  so I didn't feel as guilty.  Right.  And that helped bring  the number down a little bit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  E-Rock did make  a fatal mistake.  Yeah.  He acted like  everything was fine 
[00:46:30]  before he got the money.  That's true.  Like, once it was like,  okay, yeah, I'll get you.  He was like,  okay, we're cool.  But then there wasn't...  He shouldn't have been cool.  No.  Until he had money in his...  Right.  Until he had the moolah,  as I like to say.  If he pressured me  a little more early on,  the number would have been higher.  Oh, yeah.  But with that said,  he'll be very happy.  All right.  All righty.  He's smiling.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[00:47:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Jane says, nice.  Jane says.  Jane says.  So 90s sounding.  I watched some of those indie movies 
[00:47:30]  from the 90s.  Yeah.  And they're so dated.  Like, there were so many of them.  You know?  The whole indie scene.  Like reality bites.  Yeah.  Like, they just...  Oh, they're so dated now.  With all the music and stuff.  All the old 90s kind of music.  Yeah.  Chasing Amy.  Chasing Amy.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Chasing Amy was all right.  I like that movie.  I like Chasing Amy.  And she had had that sexual experience?  Yes.  Like, that was the true...  Finger cuffs.  She was sexy.  Called her finger cuffs.  I vaguely remember that.  What's her name?  The girl played Amy.  I don't know.  Joey Lorden Adams.  Wow.  How do you guys know that?  I think Kevin Smith was dating her.  It's for children of the 90s.  Whoa.  Nice.  Children of the 90s, are you?  Damn.  I've been one decade behind her.  I don't know.  If you guys are children of the 80s,  I think I'm children of the 2000s.  Oh, stop it.  Good one.  What year did you have that cat? 
[00:48:30]  That cat?  Travis?  What was that?  Good one.  97-ish.  That was 97?  Probably.  Oh, fruit.  What the hell?  We were on the only stage that really rocks in 97.  At what point would it have been okay?  Was there a year where it would have been acceptable?  Never.  I was warming up for the Louie Anderson show.  Whoa.  97.  So you were already famous.  That's pretty cool.  I was a zilch.  I was sharing a hotel room with three other guys. 
[00:49:00]  Sexy.  I found, by the way, I found a little Opster Flub.  What?  Found an Opster Flub.  A little?  There's a million of them.  No, but this one I found.  And I listened to it 30 times yesterday because I was going over these tapes.  But it was so small.  It's a word I say wrong.  No, no, no.  It's like you're going.  I could tell your mind went to say one thing and you said another.  And it's so small that you'd never notice it.  But I've been putting these to get this reel together.  I've been taking our old interviews and just kind of putting them onto a hard drive.  And I'm going to have an editor just to make a quick montage.  So it was the second time Tyson came in. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  And he walks in.  And it sounds like you're going to go, hey, my man.  Or hey.  Because he walks in and you go, hey, my mic.  And it's so subtle.  My mic.  I fucking listened to it about 30 times.  Oh, I was giggling.  I got nervous.  Hey.  I got nervous because I'm starting to feel like we might be friends with him.  It was the second time.  Hey, my, my, my, my.  No, no.  But it wasn't even that bad.  It wasn't like, my, my, my.  It was just like, hey, my, my.  I don't know if we have it.  Do you have it?  E-Rock, is that hard to find? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, that's funny.  If you can find it.  I'll see what I can find.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Of course you'll find that.  Right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  All excited.  Pizza garbage.  Got to pay E-Rock today.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Nirvana might be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Really?  Yeah.  This their first year of eligibility?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Never happens this early for a band.  No?  Not really.  Metallica got the first ballot.  Madonna got the first ballot.  Mr. Flash.  Yeah, what are they talking about, saying this is one of the youngest bands ever to  be, um, and they're assuming they'll be inducted, so they're saying it's like, maybe just age-wise. 
[00:50:30]  I mean, Madonna and all those people are a lot older than, like, Dave Grohl is now.  Yeah, but they still have to wait their 25 years.  Maybe I should reread that article.  I heard they were going to be, like, pretty much the youngest band ever inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Because everyone has to wait to 25.  NWA?  Sure, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and, uh, KISS is not nominated, are they? 
[00:51:00]  Yes, they're on the ballot.  They're on the ballot this year.  Is KISS usually on the ballot or no?  I think they're usually not on the ballot.  They don't deserve it.  Who else is on the ballot?  What's Link way?  What do they do?  Here, run down the list real fast.  We'll go from the top.  We'll have some strong opinions really quick.  Oh, yeah.  Paul Butterfield Blues Band.  Paul Butterfield.  I've heard that name.  Wasn't he in the band?  I don't know.  I've heard the name over the years.  I couldn't tell you one fucking song in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. 
[00:51:30]  His wife's syrup was good.  That's done.  Mrs. Butterworth.  Sheik.  Ah, freak out.  Right.  Ah, freak out.  Give me some ah, freak out.  Freak out.  This is played at, like, Studio 54 while people are sucking each other's cocks.  Doing coke.  Doing blow.  Do they have a follow-up to ah, freak out?  I'm sure it sounded just like freak out. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Are they putting a one-hit wonder into the fucking Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  I'm trying.  It's fucking amazing, right?  They nominate them.  Why would they be nominated?  I have no...  I don't know of another song Sheik did.  Sheik does not belong...  First of all, in the...  Oh, that's who the follow-up was.  It was, ah, calm down.  Ah, simmer down.  Oh, yeah.  Freak out. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Woo!  Everybody.  This song was...  Sam is dancing.  This song was huge.  Yeah.  This was a huge song.  Oh.  Disco.  Man, was it hated.  I don't know if there's any fucking type of music that was despised more by, like, people. 
[00:53:00]  I think because it got watered down.  It was the whole thing.  It wasn't just the music.  It was the whole disco fucking...  Culture.  The culture.  The people that went to the discos.  They were fucking...  The rock people hated disco.  True.  It was quite the divide.  Yeah.  But I think it also got watered down.  Because then you had all those other bands going, ah, fuck, we got to do something disco-y  or we're going to be fucked.  It kind of happened with the hair bands, too.  Disco Kiss was great.  What song was Disco Kiss? 
[00:53:30]  I Was Made For Loving You.  I Was Made For Loving You.  Which is a good song.  That's Disco Kiss, right?  That was Disco Kiss.  That was like 79 off Dynasty.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, see?  And bands panicked and said, we got to do a little disco-y thing.  We need a disco song.  It's got to hit the fucking discos.  And Gene was banging Diana Ross at the time, I think.  Was he?  For real?  We were here a couple for a while.  Yes.  I was having sex with Diana Ross at the time.  Stop typing.  With Paul, like, doing a little disco dancing, doing this? 
[00:54:00]  You know this was Paul's idea.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah, he was probably at Studio 54.  This was effortless for Paul.  Yeah, yeah.  Effortless.  I would love to kiss.  Tonight.  It's a good song.  It is a good song.  I want to give it all to you.  To you.  Yeah, I bet you do.  In the dark.  Tiny.  Yes.  There's so much I want to do.  That disco beat was so easy. 
[00:54:30]  Tick-a-tick-a-tick-a.  Tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a.  Tick-a-tick-a-tick-a.  Tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a.  It's just so easy.  All I'm laying at your feet.  There's nothing going on here.  Oh, here it comes.  Come on!  Yes, yes, people!  You're shit!  You're shit!  You're flat!  You're flat! 
[00:55:00]  Oh, God.  This is terrible.  You don't like this?  No, it's so disco.  No, it's in the guilty pleasure category.  I like that.  I would listen to that in the car.  So they're nominated.  Kiss is nominated.  Yeah, but we're going to learn a little more about Sheik really fast from Peter.  Peter.  You've got to remember, Niall Rogers from Sheik was the man.  Yeah, I know.  He's a huge producer and all that, and he worked for Madonna.  I know a little bit about him, sure.  But he did Good Times.  We Are Family.  Good Times. 
[00:55:30]  But is that all Sheik songs?  I think it's Niall Rogers.  Yeah.  He could go in by himself.  No, he could go in by himself is right.  We're talking about Sheik.  What other songs did Sheik have?  Well, I work for Niall now, and the stuff he does live is We Are Family.  That's Sister Sledge, Bucko.  We're talking about Sheik.  The group Sheik.  What was the other song Sheik had that they were inducted into the, well, nominated?  Dance, dance, dance, dance. 
[00:56:00]  Exactly.  I know that song, though.  I know that one.  Here, do dance, dance, dance.  I know what he's talking about.  I know what he's talking about.  He's right.  He has to sing it.  This is Sheik.  Yeah.  Good Times.  Oh, this is Sheik.  Oh, well, fuck us, Ronan.  Yeah, but one of the two or three big ones.  Yeah.  These were monster songs.  They're Chisco, though.  And they had this one.  Don't forget David Bowie's left dance.  David Bowie's modern rock.  All right.  Stop mentioning other people.  It's all Sheik. 
[00:56:30]  Stop mentioning the producer.  He loves Niall Rogers.  No, stop it.  Well, it works for the man.  I know.  This probably is Niall Rogers on the phone.  I think if you were a band back then, all you had to have was the word dance in your  song, and they were going to play it.  Exactly.  Because, I mean, listen to this.  They're just saying dance, dance, dance.  Oh, they loved that dance.  Dancing to your queef.  Other bands nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  One of my favorites growing up. 
[00:57:00]  Deep fucking Purple.  Deep Purple.  Good.  About time.  Deep Purple.  Deep Purple.  Yes.  Look at that.  What are we talking?  Perfect Strangers?  Knocking on your back door.  That's some of the later Deep Purple.  It was a big comeback for them when they put that shit out.  People thought they were dead in the water.  China Grove?  China Grove?  That's the Doobie Brothers.  No.  I know.  Which is the other one, though?  No, no.  China.  What was their China one?  Oh, uh...  They had a China one, didn't they?  Oh, shit. 
[00:57:30]  I'm not seeing any China.  No, I know what he's talking about.  A woman from Tokyo.  Ah, that's the one.  My woman from Tokyo.  I know it was some China thing.  They shoehorn Tokyo, though.  You gotta be honest.  Tokyo.  Tokyo.  Tokyo.  Yes.  He did.  My woman from Tokyo.  Tokyo.  Now we gotta hear that.  Fuck.  I think Deep Purple held the record for the loudest band for quite a while. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, I heard that.  They just smashed that, didn't they?  No.  I think so.  Yeah.  Where's the low guitar?  Hello.  I don't...  This is a six-minute song.  You don't know this song he wrote?  No.  Come on!  How do you not know this song?  I know Smoke on the Water.  Yeah, it's a pretty big song.  This is huge. 
[00:58:30]  John Rock Radio.  Is it John Lloyds on the fucking keyboard there?  I was in a gang called the Lloyds.  I know.  Tough guy.  This was a staple of the home of rock and rolls out there.  Oh, yeah.  I just want to hear a woman from Tokyo.  That's a good rock singing voice right there.  Ow!  I feel it in my heart!  My woman from Tokyo!  Ha ha ha! 
[00:59:00]  Tokyo!  Ha ha!  She a warning, motherfucker!  My woman from Tokyo!  It's okay, yo!  She wrote this fucking Todd.  All right.  More nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Peter Gabriel.  Sure.  Peter Gabriel, thumbs up or down?  Little Red Rain.  I'm not a fan.  Salisbury Hill?  I gotta tell you.  No Salisbury Hill?  Shuck the monkey. 
[00:59:30]  Shuck the monkey.  Shuck.  Shuck.  What about Beagle?  No, I'm not a big Peter Gabriel fan, but, you know, whatever.  I loved Peter Gabriel for a while there.  The next one on the list.  You got a little too poppy, though.  No.  All right, keep going.  The next one on the list is...  Oh, me and Anthony.  That's me, yes.  That's sick as you got there!  Ha ha ha!  So sick of that one.  Yes, the music version of Opie and Anthony.  Hall and Oates.  Oh.  We're all like, hey, guys, congratulations on your nomination! 
[01:00:00]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Favorite Hall and Oates song?  I have to say...  They had a lot of hits.  Mmm.  I'm gonna go queer with this one.  Yeah, you gotta go a little queer.  I'm gonna go queer with this one.  A little Sarah Smile.  Ah.  I like when they slowed it down a bit.  Make my dreams come true. 
[01:00:30]  Uh, really?  I told you my father got that 45.  He played it so many times in a row.  Right.  And my grandmother was so annoyed.  She goes, oh, listen to Johnny OneNote.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Yes, Johnny OneNote.  Ha ha ha!  Uh.  Man, I'm a big Sarah Smile fan.  That's some grooving music right here.  What's your favorite Hall and Oates song?  They had a million fucking hits.  I gotta go really faggy on this one.  I kinda like that.  Your kiss is on my lips.  That's good, yeah.  That's a good one.  Boy, that song, Ignore Louie. 
[01:01:00]  Does anybody remember that one?  The guy ignored Louie C.J. in the fucking lobby.  He was working.  Louie thought they were gonna, like, make eye contact  and two famous guys say hi.  And it was when Gervais was leaving.  It was on...  I filmed the aftermath, unfortunately.  I didn't film the confrontation where he got the big blow off.  But then I filmed the part where Ricky was just giving Louie the business in the elevator.  The business.  Oh, boy, was he.  Oh.  Sarah Smile did not come out in the 80s. 
[01:01:30]  No.  So?  1976.  Yeah?  Do you have a fucking radio?  There's classic rock?  I don't know.  It didn't have to come out.  I'm not saying when it came out.  Jeez.  This is a rip-off of another song that I like.  Is it?  My kiss is on your lips.  Yeah.  My hat is on your rack.  I never heard that one.  Hall of notes.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  They had a fuckload of hits and absolutely deserved to be nominated.  What was their last big song?  Every year they would have at least one hit for a long time.  What was the last hit, according to the charts here?  Maybe Everything Your Heart Desires.  So close from...  So close that got to number 11.  What was that?  All right.  Keep going.  Is that it?  Yeah.  So close was the last thing that came close to the top 10. 
[01:02:30]  1990.  Wow.  Really?  They were huge in the 80s.  So why does it dry up all of a sudden?  It was like the 80s ended and so did they.  Because these guys had a hit almost every year for a long fucking time.  And it just dries up.  People just get sick of the sound or something.  Yeah, because this was not...  Yeah, the sound.  No, this wasn't like a big one.  I don't remember this.  Yeah.  That music sounds like every fucking teen 80s movie.  All right, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  The back?  Yeah.  The Judd Nelson breakdown scene.  They met on the dance floor.  Oh, jeez.  Sounds like meatloaf.  They met on the dance floor.  No one meets on the dance floor.  This is so that Tom Cruise in Born on the Fourth of July.  He's in a wheelchair and he tries to get that girl to go to Mexico with him.  Did you ever meet anyone on the dance floor?  Usually staggered drunkenly to the dance floor and mushed your genitals against a woman to some dumb slow song. 
[01:03:30]  Well, they deserve it.  Who else?  Let's get through this shit.  Kiss.  Yes.  Which he talked about.  Nah, Kiss.  Overrated.  No!  Opie, no!  LL Cool Joe.  No.  Ladies love Cool James.  That's so stupid.  Yeah.  It's not Rock.  That's for sure.  How many did he have?  How many hits?  I like talking about the hits when it comes to this shit.  Oh, LL had a ton of hits. 
[01:04:00]  Nah, he had Mama Knock Me Out and that was about it.  Rock the Bells was big.  My radio was big.  Yeah, Mama Said Knock You Out was his comeback hit.  I mean, he had a ridiculous amount of hits.  They weren't Rock hits, but whatever.  And that song's terrible, by the way, Mama Said Knock You Out's terrible.  Has he ever talked about the deodorant shit?  What?  I know what you're talking about.  Thank you.  What?  What happened?  The only thing I know about LL Cool J, he was in that fucking video with deodorant.  Clumps of deodorant under his arms. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  And he's unplugged.  Yeah, go show these guys.  Don't call it a comeback.  Well, black people have a problem with the white deodorant.  You know.  Yeah, but they've got to make some with brown coloring in it.  Look, you don't know this?  That's deodorant hanging from his armpit hair.  Hanging.  Yes.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  Like, how did he not know?  Right?  You don't like this song?  The beat of it's okay.  I hate the chorus. 
[01:05:00]  I guess the chorus I hate.  It's okay.  The chorus stinks.  Oh.  Oh.  Mama said knock you out.  Mama?  I'm gonna knock you out.  He went to his mom.  I understand.  Mmm.  Mama said.  Yeah.  Mama said.  You gotta knock him out.  Knock him out or something.  I'm gonna knock you out.  Right enough of this.  LL Cool J is hot as hell.  Yeah, Rock the Bells is big.  Anybody I don't hear you tell.  I excel.  They all fail.  The friggin' orchestra drop sound. 
[01:05:30]  I didn't know he was in Run DMC.  He also had...  That's Run's fuckin' sound.  Many people think the first hip-hop ballad.  Wait, um...  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  You know it.  I know, I know.  I can't remember.  I need love.  I need love, girl.  Yeah.  God, I hate that song.  Oh, yeah.  I need love, girl.  Nothing's better than the Joe Piscopo rap that he did at Club Piscopo. 
[01:06:00]  I love the shadow on the wall.  I was sending Colin screen caps for the shadow.  The shadow on the wall.  Remember this?  Yeah.  It's the sensitive side of rap.  This is actually...  I would play this at my wedding, and I would mouth it to my fuckin' fiancée.  I used to date a girl.  We would slow dance at these sober dances.  And she would mouth the lyrics to love songs.  And I'd be so humiliated.  I would just try to put my face by her head.  Yeah, stop doing that.  Stop pointing and singing to me. 
[01:06:30]  It's awful.  That is awful.  Alright, let's move on with the list.  So you get the LL.  The meters.  What?  The meters?  Oh, the metric group.  The meters?  Oh, we're a unit of measurement.  You know what I'm saying?  Why are they important?  I don't know.  Maybe that's the Too Cool for the Room nomination.  Their song, Sissy Strut.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear Sissy Strut. 
[01:07:00]  Look Up High Pie are considered funk classics.  Let's hear Sissy Strut.  You can see that if Sal walks in.  Sorry, Sal.  The meters, right?  Yeah, the meters.  Sissy Strut.  Big funk band, I guess.  Horse shit.  No tolerance.  I love it.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I know what I like right away.  You and that fucking guy, that yelling troll, would have a great conversation about music. 
[01:07:30]  It's shit.  It's flat.  I hate it.  Yes.  I want to get that guy on the show.  How do we do that?  I want to hang out with that guy and fucking go to dinner with him.  And scream at me.  Alright, it's going to take forever to get this song going.  Fuck him.  Alright, then we move on to Nirvana.  Nirvana, of course.  NWA, nice.  NWA.  I love the NWA.  Are they Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, though?  Well, they should just call it Music Hall of Fame, obviously.  I mean, if Madonna's in it and run DMC.  Yeah, it's kind of dumb at this point to call it the Rock and Roll Hall of... 
[01:08:00]  The what?  The replacements?  The replacements.  What?  There were always people around that liked the replacements.  And then you would ask them why, and they couldn't even give you an answer.  By the way, do you know why I'm so psyched about this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  A couple of reasons.  Kiss.  Because Kiss is there, which would mean all four original members in one place, which  is impossible to get.  If they get in.  If they get in.  Unless you're Opie and Anthony back in 19... 
[01:08:30]  Oh.  What year was that?  You had the original guys in, huh?  No, didn't we?  We might have been missing Peter Criss.  Oh, we didn't have Peter Criss.  Now that I think about it.  Okay, you're right.  You think the band will get together for that?  Yeah, because there's too much money in a greatest hits record and stuff.  There's a lot of money in that for those guys.  If they come in, there's renewed interest in a band.  Sometimes they don't, but a lot of times you get them to do it.  And fuck.  It's in New York.  You're going to go to Cleveland?  What's that?  Are you going to Cleveland? 
[01:09:00]  It's in New York that year.  Would I go to Cleveland if there was a possibility of meeting them together?  Yeah, I'd fly to Cleveland.  Why would you even ask that question to you?  Of course you would.  It's the original Kiss.  That's my last giant get.  They did something a little differently this year.  They're nominating the skinny Linda Ronstadt.  Yes.  Not the fat one.  Just the skinny one.  Just the skinny one.  A little strange.  I used to fuck...  Jerry Brown.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jerry Brown.  And she came out recently saying that she can't sing anymore because...  What's she got?  Like Parkinson's, I think? 
[01:09:30]  Oh, no.  She can't sing at all anymore.  She's done.  How old is she?  Man, she's not even that old.  Parkinson's stops you from singing.  Was it Parkinson's?  Could somebody help me out?  She's got to be up there.  Yeah, who else?  She's 60?  Cat Stevens.  Cat Stevens.  I had enough with him.  He was good.  A little Peace Train action.  That fucking Muslim.  Sing your new version of fucking Wild World.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a new version of it.  Yeah.  Which is like Muslim friendly.  Yes, of course it is.  He's not singing to a girl.  He's like singing to his son or something.  What about Peace Train?  Does he still sing that? 
[01:10:00]  Probably.  Strap a bomb to yourself song?  Yeah.  You're a fucking...  Fuck him.  What is this?  A little cat.  He's good though.  Oh, yeah.  Surprise, you don't like him with your cat.  That's a good one, Chip.  He was pretty big.  Yeah.  T for the chill, man.  He's good, man.  All right, move on to Link Wray. 
[01:10:30]  What's that?  Link Wray.  He was...  I guess he was popular in the late 50s.  Oh, God.  Doing what?  He's an American rock and roll guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist.  Never heard of him, sir.  All right, move on.  I like...  I like this.  Why learn?  Yeah, why learn?  Stupid learning.  I know who he is.  Be quiet.  And a band people either love or hate.  I think we might have a hater in the studio.  I think this is what...  You're not a fan of the Yes, are you?  No, I like Yes.  You do like the Yes. 
[01:11:00]  Sure.  All right.  I like the Lister Metals.  Oh, stop with that guy.  With that guy.  I hate that guy.  Ray, thank you.  Litter Onstead has MS, actually.  I knew a song.  Oh, wow.  I apologize for saying Parkinson's.  It's MS, and she can't sing anymore.  Oh, man.  Thank you, Ray.  Yes, it's Apple.  MS is a motherfucker, man.  Songbird been silenced.  It's absolutely the MS.  She had a lot of hits, too.  She didn't write them, but she had a lot of hits.  Last one.  Wait, Yes.  Yes, William Shatner. 
[01:11:30]  Let's enjoy some Yes for a little bit.  I'm playing with some of the Yes guys.  I liked Yes.  Put on one of their instrumentals.  Stop.  I like a good instrumental.  Yes.  What did they do?  What?  Right?  Complexity of the music.  Yours is no disgrace! 
[01:12:00]  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  God.  Yes had some fucking monster songs.  Yeah.  Right?  They certainly did.  Did they do Roundabout?  And they had the...  Wait.  We're not acknowledging it today.  They had very big double-fold albums with all that weird artwork on it and shit.  You knew Yes artwork.  Oh, yeah.  Roundabout.  My friend Kenny loved them growing up.  The guy I would smoke pot and play, like, Scrabble with, Kenny Hines. 
[01:12:30]  He had to smoke some weed.  He loved Yes, and I just could not get into it.  You never got into Yes at all, huh?  No, but he loved them.  And then they did all right with It Can Happen to You.  It can happen to you.  It can happen to me.  I was talking to someone recently that, you know, John Anderson's now out of the band,  but they got a guy that sounds just like John Anderson, and no one gives a fuck.  No one cares.  No one gives a fuck, meaning that John Anderson's not in the band anymore.  They're selling out all over the place.  And his name is, like, John Arnarson. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Like, it's a close enough name where someone might...  Where they could put it on the poster, most people just assume they're seeing John Anderson's name.  Is that the guy's real name, or do you think you changed it?  I think they changed it around.  Could we find Yes with the new singer?  New Yes.  New Yes.  Yes.  What's his name, the new singer?  Ant's right.  It's very close to...  John Davison.  John Davison.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a son Anderson...  I need to hear one song by this guy. 
[01:13:30]  Yes, let's hear it.  And we got to go hit.  We've seen All Good People.  There you go.  Wait, wait.  All right.  Turn this shit off.  There we go.  We got all the people sitting down. 
[01:14:00]  Horrible recording.  Nice.  Cell phone recording.  Let's hear it.  Pretty close.  That's fine.  That's a hard song to sing, I'm sure.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  That's fine.  The problem with Yes, the rest of the guys are fucking old.  Yeah.  That's a really old band.  I think most of those guys are in their 70s.  You know what, though?  They're not a band where you got to jump around like a nut.  You can just stand there and play.  Right.  People aren't there to watch a stage show.  Do you remember when John Anderson was at the CES?  Of course.  Just hanging out.  Just singing some acoustic guests.  And we're sitting there like, what?  Jesus.  There was like, what, 20 of us?  What was he singing?  I don't remember that.  Oh, you must have left.  After we broadcasted, I remember because I stuck around. 
[01:15:00]  They set up for John Anderson.  He did some Q&A.  Oh.  And then he started just singing.  Acapella or, yeah, just kind of hanging out singing some shit.  John on Long Island, you saw Yes recently?  Yeah, we saw him over at Westbury Music Fair with Proko Haram.  Proko Haram got on and absolutely blew the place away.  It was an unbelievable show.  Yes, get on.  And they droned on.  And on.  And on.  They played new stuff that was even more fucking boring than the old stuff. 
[01:15:30]  Oh.  Not a big yes.  It was terrible.  They did a couple of songs for brain, was it brainchild surgery?  That were okay.  After that, it was terrible.  You want to stick a knife in your eye, it was that fucking bad.  You didn't want to do that, stick it in your ear?  Oh, my God.  I thought ELP did brainchild surgery.  What's his name?  The guitar player sits there and he does his acoustic.  That was ELP.  Did you make an ELP reference in your Yes rant? 
[01:16:00]  Brainchild surgery was ELP.  Right.  I'm sorry.  I got confused.  Thanks, John.  Bye.  And then the zombie.  She's not there.  Give me some zombies, Z-Rock.  They have been nominated.  Oh.  I think they had two songs.  I know.  That's another one that's like, oh.  This will be our year, right?  Isn't that one of the zombies?  What?  Isn't that a big song from the zombies?  I don't know.  I've never heard of them.  What is the song? 
[01:16:30]  Are you just making stuff up?  No, no, no.  Are you taking a stab in the dark?  Be honest.  No.  No.  This will be our year is another song from the zombies.  Time of the season?  Oh, time of the season is a biggie.  Yeah.  And she's not there with the two I know.  She's not there.  It's the time of the season.  Oh, yeah.  I fucking love this song, actually.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Why do drums sound different in older songs? 
[01:17:00]  You can tell it's an older song.  What is it about the drums?  I don't think they mic them as well.  Oh, maybe.  Not a lot of bottom end on them.  This just sounds like the sixes.  I picture Huey helicopters over Rice Paddy's just mowing down everything.  Yes.  I picture yours over the L.I.E. almost doing that.  I think that's whoops.  The color of the heart.  Yeah.  Sal also says drums don't come out good when recorded on old tape. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, I don't mind these sounds.  They come out better.  Oh, Jesus.  Now they're arguing.  But no, E-Rock said completely the opposite.  I know.  Right.  No one really listens to Sal, so I don't blame E-Rock on that one.  See, I actually like this.  Yeah.  You like this?  The drums, yeah.  I like older drums.  And that's what Sal said.  They just didn't have the fucking equipment.  It sounds better.  Equalizing that they do now and fucking the way they mic all the kits themselves, the bass drums, the fucking... 
[01:18:00]  Plus, Sal said the drums don't sound as good on tape.  Right, of course.  It's the tape.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You've never heard this.  You know time of the season.  I've never heard this.  Okay.  Very good song.  He's got a cool little voice.  What's his name?  I don't even know the lead singer's name of the zombies.  Rob?  Yeah, Rob Zombie ripped off the zombies.  Exactly.  There you go.  Thank you, fucking Jim Northen.  You're welcome.  If I had a new group called Bill ELO, you wouldn't listen to it. 
[01:18:30]  This is one of those songs that should make you all sad, though, Jimmy.  Brings you back to a time.  Brings you back.  What year was this?  I'm going to guess 65 or 67.  67, I'm going with.  69.  Fuck!  That's that hippie shit.  Hippie shit depresses me.  I remember this when it was on the radio.  What?  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:00]  Jesus.  You can say that about Jailhouse Rock.  No, I can't.  Did the zombies have a third song?  Yeah.  What is it?  Tell Her No?  This is the song I was talking about.  This will be our year.  I use this a lot.  Nothing.  I don't know this one.  I don't know it.  Tell Her No was a hit.  I think Tell Her No was a hit.  It sounds familiar.  Don't let go of my hand now. 
[01:19:30]  It's a cool song, though.  Yeah, but it sounds too old or something.  I'm going to listen to that later.  They use it a lot for TV stuff.  Okay.  Oh, whatever.  And if she should tell you.  I think I've heard that.  No, I don't know this one either, really.  Yeah, I've heard this one.  Is this Tell Her No?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Okay.  Why aren't they doing that yet?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  They pushed this to the AM side.  Yeah.  Were they British?  Yeah, this is definitely English.  Yeah, I think they're English, right?  We got a guy.  We're very lucky today.  He wants to talk about the zombies and tape.  Oh, great.  Go ahead, David.  Hey, guys, Zombies and Tape.  Colin Blundstone was the lead singer for the Zombies.  Okay.  Yeah.  They also had a guy named Rod Argent who had some hits. 
[01:20:30]  Argent.  We know Argent.  Argent.  Hold your head up.  He was the keyboard player.  I know Argent.  Are these guys alive or dead?  Wow, they got to be.  Yeah, they're still alive.  Okay, cool.  Still alive.  Five hits and they're still alive.  Nobody's pulled the plug yet.  Wait a minute.  Oh, so the Argent dude was in the Zombies?  Yeah, he was the keyboard player.  I did not know that.  How about that little tidbit?  I knew that.  That's a fun fact.  Yeah, this song everyone knows.  This guy was in the Zombies. 
[01:21:00]  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Thanks, David.  Now he's making his money off of some commercial where they're choosing to hold your head up.  All right.  Thank you.  Sum it up in an email.  All right.  I'll see you.  Sum it up in an email.  That's a good one.  Holy shit.  Keyboard heavy. 
[01:21:30]  There you go.  Yeah, what do they use this song for?  Are you making some of that fucking commercial money?  Yeah, I don't know what commercial.  Does sound a little sticks-ish.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Hold your head up.  Hold your head up.  Oh, it's a commercial for Al-Qaeda.  Are you there?  Hold your head up after they cut it off. 
[01:22:00]  I understood.  It was good.  It was very good.  All right.  Yes.  We're going to take a break because we're going to do some Jocktober.  Well, there you go.  The nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Are you just going to blow off paying Iraq?  Is that what we're going to do?  Yeah, it'll happen.  Is that what's going to happen?  This is what has to happen.  We've got to do Jocktober, then pay Iraq, and then we do the Piers Morgan.  Yes.  No, the pay thing goes on today.  It's been on long enough.  I need a few days to crunch the numbers. 
[01:22:30]  I'm good.  I'm just very curious.  I crunched.  To see how much you crunched.  There's logic involved with the payment, too.  Yeah.  Okay.  I really thought this one out.  Maybe the payment should come first before Jocktober.  I really thought this one out.  You were crunching numbers.  Iraq's crunching hardwood floors.  Because he's heavy.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[01:23:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show. 
[01:23:30]  Show.  Show.  Show.  All right, we got lots to do.  We got Piers Morgan coming in.  He warned us to be on our A-game.  I am.  He tweeted us saying he's coming on our show and we better be on our A-game.  I agree with, like, everything he says, so it should be pretty nice.  I respect Piers that he actually takes on tough topics. 
[01:24:00]  I respect that.  He speaks his mind.  He speaks his mind.  We went at it a little bit on Twitter a while back because I was so frustrated that he wouldn't acknowledge, like, you know, their responsibility in school shootings and whatnot by just showing these fucking assholes night after night and turning them into, you know, rock stars.  Yeah.  And I absolutely think that that could possibly influence some, you know, some down and out kids out there to do the exact same fucking thing. 
[01:24:30]  And I couldn't get him to admit it.  And he came close because at one point he goes, look, I like you guys.  We're going back and forth.  And I'm like, that's I don't give a fuck if you like us.  Answer the question.  Do you think the media influences, you know, some of this shit?  He's got a book, Shooting Straight.  Yeah.  Piers Morgan.  I bet you it's a good read.  Oh, I like how shooting is really big on the front of the book, which he's just using the controversies that he's put on his show. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  With the guns to sell his book.  Well, that's all right.  Well, is it?  Yeah.  Guns, gays, God, and George Clooney.  Where's he with the gays?  He probably loves the gay.  I would assume.  He's a very liberal guy.  You can't, and you can't come out and say you don't like gays.  You know.  I don't really care either way about gay. 
[01:25:30]  If you want to be gay, be gay.  Gay!  Just don't shove it in my fucking face.  That stupid argument.  Shut up.  More blowhard shit.  Blowhard.  John and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  That's what my Bible said.  You like that one?  Fuck yeah, my mother would say that.  Would she, Chip?  Never suck a peck a chipper.  God will punish you.  That's not quite as poetic. 
[01:26:00]  The Institute of Marriage.  The Bible says marriage is between a man and a woman.  I could give a shit what gays want to do.  I so don't care what the fuck gays want to do.  It's not going to affect my fucking life one iota.  And these assholes use religion to back them up on their fucking claims.  Back them up.  The Bible says, oh, shut up.  Well, the Bible says you're not supposed to eat shrimp either. 
[01:26:30]  I love scrimps.  Look it up.  It's in there.  What happened?  There's some scrimp.  What happened?  I was going to ask, did you see that video a couple months ago of the Australian prime  minister talking about how he changed his stance on homosexuality?  I nigh.  He was like a devout Catholic or Christian or something.  I nigh.  What happened?  It was during a town hall meeting or something, and this guy asked him about it.  And he just completely trapped this religious guy into his way of thinking. 
[01:27:00]  Found Jesus?  Don't like the queers?  It was just really...  Or hype the guy?  I was not going anywhere with it.  Fuck the queers?  It was good.  All right.  Well, listen.  A man with a woman chipper.  Is that what your mom said?  Yeah.  That's right.  I'm all for stalling, man.  Let's pay.  That means I don't have to pay E-Rock.  E-Rock didn't even play your club.  He's a good guy.  You should definitely pay him.  We're going to do this first.  It's Jocktober. 
[01:27:30]  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-T.  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys.  It's time for Jocktober.  I want to see the boat movie. 
[01:28:00]  I was reading on Twitter.  Some guy said he wants to go see Captain Phillips so he could go to the ticket booth and just say,  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  Right at the old ticket window.  I would imagine a lot of people are saying that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  People driving their spouses crazy.  What are we doing tonight?  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  He just sounds retarded.  I love it.  I want to see the boat movie.  Do you?  Okay.  Got a tree on my house. 
[01:28:30]  I got a tree on my house.  On my house.  Oh.  Somebody.  Fuck.  Uh-oh.  That's a great motto to have.  Somebody fuck.  What happened?  I need to be more organized.  Uh-oh.  I got to get organized.  Organized.  Yeah, I got to get organized.  Okay, fix the phone.  There's 40 guys with guns coming to kill you.  I mean, straighten the phone out.  He fixes the phone.  Yeah.  He fucking shuffles his paperwork when he's hosting nightly news.  That was also, um... 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, the Scott Shannon slam on Twitter.  Basically, uh, they were talking today.  Fuck what is it?  Taxi Driver, he did that, too.  There was a thing on there, too, with the poster that said,  I got to get organized.  And it was spelt different.  It was organized instead of organized.  Wow.  And he brought that up.  It was a weird little fucking...  I remember that.  Just a quick thing in Taxi Driver.  Yeah.  Organized.  He looks...  Hey.  Bobo is gay on Twitter, who's, uh...  Defending, uh, fake Twitter accounts in general. 
[01:29:30]  Uh-huh.  I like the Bobo is gay.  He writes, uh, Scott Shannon asked this morning  if it's still customary to tip ushers at Broadway shows.  What?  And then he writes, what a fossil.  What?  Why would you bring that up on a radio show?  Tip ushers at Broadway shows?  No one does that.  What does that?  I don't know.  Maybe you could catch that for...  Wow.  Maybe, uh, you could have one of the guys, uh, grab that clip,  because that could be terrific for Scott and Todd Fry.  And I'm sure then he was put... 
[01:30:00]  Quickly put on the pay-no-mind list.  Yeah.  Probably ignored.  The permanent residence there.  Right.  Yeah.  I gotta do a phony phone call.  God!  Oh, I said, Jerky, I don't need to talk to you.  I saw you went back and forth with the Jerky Boy guy.  Johnny, thank me for, uh...  Yeah.  I used to thank us for playing the audio and pointing out...  He goes, I guess they're still stealing.  So he's fully aware that, uh, the Todd dude's been stealing from him for years.  Yeah, fucking just conceptual thieves.  Yeah, stealing his concepts.  Johnny's doing good, too, huh?  Good. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, he's doing voices.  Some cartoon voices.  I like the Johnny guy.  Yeah, ha.  Uh, this is a to-be-continued that we're finally continuing.  This is from yesterday.  Terry Clifford.  We're still on, uh, Rochester's New Country, WBEE, the Morning Coffee Club, with the great  Terry Clifford.  Whew.  I'm starting to feel a little guilt with this one.  Why?  I don't know.  Because I'm changing.  He sounds like Chip.  It's a head toward menopause.  I think I'm starting to change.  Oh, is that in hot flashes? 
[01:31:00]  You changed life?  Christ.  Emotional.  No, this shit never used to bother me.  Do you need to take Compose?  Do you remember Compose?  Some Boniva?  Boniva and Compose.  There used to be a commercial for this fucking, this drug.  It was called Compose.  Keep stalling, man, because I'm not paying any rent.  Oh, oh.  And, uh.  No, I'm liking this.  The commercials were this woman.  Yeah.  And she's like, just about freaking out.  Right.  She's like, oh, the daughter's getting married. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know what to wear.  And then the husband has to come up and go, honey, honey.  And he kind of gently grabs her chin in his hand.  He goes, take a Compose.  And she'd take a pill and, like, be cool.  Like, oh, everything's fine now.  It's just, it's a Valium.  It's an amazing, like, statement on what was going on back then.  Like, it wasn't geared toward men at all.  Like, a man would never take Compose.  It's like, Compose yourself.  Why don't we find the commercial for tomorrow?  For tomorrow. 
[01:32:00]  Yes, because we're trying to get the E-Rock thing over and done with.  Get your fucking shit together, bitch.  E-Rock gets paid within the hour.  Wow.  Before Piers Morgan.  Oh.  Yeah, but the Terry Cleffert thing.  I'm starting to feel a little.  Let's finish it up.  We'll be gentle.  You know that hack bit where you got the devil on your shoulder and you got the fucking angel  over here?  Uh-huh.  That's what I'm kind of saying on my shoulder.  Why?  The devil's like, do it, do it, you fucking piece of shit.  And then the angel's like, you've changed. 
[01:32:30]  I got two devils.  We should not be happy with you.  I used to hate that bit.  Every fucking cartoon did it.  Yeah.  Anyway, where were we, Sam?  What track?  I believe we were right around track four.  Terry can't believe how far Jeremy has gone with one of his insults this time.  Do you remember Terry Cleffert as the lovable lady, young, beautiful young lady?  What?  The lovable oaf. 
[01:33:00]  She has an oaf.  Exactly.  She's oafish.  She's Del Griffith.  And Jeremy is the young, really just...  Too cool for the room guy.  Doesn't care.  Hey, man.  I'm so cool.  I'm on a country music station.  That's how cool I am.  But he gets extreme.  Oh, yeah.  He does get extreme.  Sam Roberts.  His point of view is insult.  He's opinionated.  And that's why people love him.  Oh, Jesus.  Love to hate him is more like it.  You know what I mean?  Oh, now.  But he doesn't care.  Oh, come on. 
[01:33:30]  Are you going to waste all that manpower and labor to hang him up and take him down in  the same month when you could use that time to, I don't know, maybe pick up some trash  around the same street you're hanging these flags on?  You know, we all think we can do a better job.  We all do, but...  Oh, this is the jab clip.  A better jab.  You know, we all do our jab.  I said this to myself a few times.  A jab.  We all can do a better jab.  Her voice is anti-sexy.  It's terrible.  It's the opposite of sexy. 
[01:34:00]  It is the anti-matter of sexy.  We can do a better job.  We all do.  But I don't know.  I don't know.  And I shouldn't complain, because I did enjoy them, and I do enjoy them.  Alex White over here, are you?  You know, I'll debate that guy.  If Lovely Warren won't do it, set it up.  Call Channel 8.  We'll get in there, and I'll square off against old giant glasses.  I don't...  Oh, Jeremy!  Oh, Jeremy!  That's why people fucking hate women on the radio. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, God, listen to that.  What?  Who says that?  Right, because it'll allow the guy to keep going.  I'd listen to that shit.  Oh, Jeremy!  Jeremy!  Well, did you hear Jeremy say the guy had giant glasses?  That is a little over the top.  But then the yield sign, stop sign appears.  Well, maybe that's what she drinks gravy out of.  Giant glasses.  It's not your jab to make fun of people.  Jab.  Your jab. 
[01:35:00]  Hey there.  What's your jab?  Yeah.  Picking up scales.  You thought you were going to steal from me?  I'm going to have a hot meal, and I'm going to find your wife, and I'm going to kill her, too.  Sidney, have a fucking cream soda.  Just don't make fun of my big glasses.  Well, Jeremy continues.  Jeremy's just fucking...  Oh, man.  This guy's out of control.  He's on the edge, man.  He's pushing it.  This young broadcaster that's full of young cum.  Terry is blown away by what Jeremy said to his grandmother. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  Did you hear this?  I know.  We went over to Uno, because she said something as soon as I was driving through Henrietta.  So I went to the closest place.  So I just took a right there.  Marketplace.  Oh, my God.  It was so funny.  She goes, um...  She saw the sign for Marketplace Mall.  She goes, Marketplace Mall.  What's that?  And I couldn't help it.  I knew I should have not been a smart aleck. 
[01:36:00]  But I said, um...  Well, I don't know.  You know, I've lived here 10 years.  I forget back home if they have these.  But you know those places where, like, there'll be a whole bunch of retail stores?  Oh, my God.  Like, in one big building?  You said that to your grandmother?  Did she haul off?  No.  She goes, okay, that was a dumb question.  I'm sorry.  And then she...  That is...  You still feel it bad?  That's fucking hideous.  Wow. 
[01:36:30]  But he bothers me, too.  He stinks, too.  That story sucks.  Smart aleck.  And then she's trying to pump it up with our stupid...  You said that to your grandmother?  You said that?  Yeah.  You said that?  Oh, my gosh.  I could see if he said...  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  You said that?  What?  You said that?  My grandmother said I was hungry, so I threatened to kick her in the womb.  All right.  That's what you do.  You said that to your grandmother?  Oh, you said that?  That's not your jab?  It's not your jab? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, my gosh.  And the third guy on the show, Steve, is just sitting back like, I can't believe...  Leave Steve alone.  He wants to be back with Brother Louise, I guarantee you.  Well, that's obvious.  He's sitting back going, I can't believe I'm stuck with these two fucking idiots.  Oh, man.  He doesn't say a word when all this stuff is going on.  Yo, Steve, love you, miss you.  Love you, miss you.  Love the houseman, radio veteran of Rochester.  Love you, miss you, is the official cold call goodbye.  Oh.  That's not your jab.  Your jab.  Who said that to your grandmother? 
[01:37:30]  Your grandmother?  Jeremy talks more about his grandmother.  Great.  Yeah.  Terry Clifford has never heard anything like this before.  Oh?  You practice him being cool?  Yeah.  Just not caring?  I don't know.  Fuck.  So we get home, and the old lady doesn't do squat all night.  I thought she'd get a home-cooked meal, not a back-scratching.  Well, she traveled all day for crying out loud. 
[01:38:00]  She was probably exhausted.  She had a 15-minute delay in Chicago.  In Chicago.  I had leftover Unos for dinner.  Oh, my God.  I didn't fly her up here to eat Unos.  Oh, Jeremy.  No, but it was awesome.  Stop it.  Oh, my fucking God.  Oh, God.  We all just pulled our eyes apart.  I know.  Everyone kind of went, oh.  We're in a monstrous hole. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  She's terrible.  David and the dentist going, is this real life?  Is this real life?  Oh, Jeremy.  Oh, Jeremy.  Jeremy.  He's saying nothing outrageous.  Nothing.  Unos.  Unos.  Oh, Jeremy.  Maybe she just really wants some Unos.  Yeah, maybe she's mad that he didn't bring it in because he likes to bring in his crust,  and she eats it off the floor like a fucking farm animal during the break.  I love her delivery, though.  Oh, Jeremy.  Jeremy is just getting me very upset. 
[01:39:00]  Your grandmother.  An hour and 15 minute delay in Chicago.  Chicago.  Chicago.  Jeremy.  In this clip.  She sounds like Gollum if Gollum was a fat woman.  Whoa.  Exactly.  In this clip, Jeremy talks about his grandmother, and Terry thinks he's gone too far.  Of course.  I swear it's a different clip. 
[01:39:30]  Steve, a hot air balloon ride?  Totally worth the money.  That's why we want to do it.  Julie and I would have a blast up there.  Hey, Newman, Bristol Mountain has the Scottish Highland Games on Sunday.  Hey, oh, that's where I'll go.  Yeah, it's been long enough since my grandpa died.  My grandmother could look at some guys in kilts.  I'm sure she'll love that.  Hey.  She's still a woman, Bert. 
[01:40:00]  Better than looking at your fat ass.  Oh.  I hate the way every time she laughs, she laughs like De Niro in Raising Bull.  Oh, no, she laughs like Tommy Cuomo going, fuck him up.  Fuck him up.  She can't believe what she just heard.  Yeah.  I stopped the clip just before the Terry Clifford.  Oh, good.  Just so you could really enjoy it here.  Right.  I'm sure she'll love that.  Hey, she's still a woman, Bert. 
[01:40:30]  Jeremy.  She's a grandmother.  I'm uncomfortable for her in this conversation.  I'm just kidding, for God's sakes.  Oh, my God.  Outrageous.  It's just, there's, oh, my God, it's nothingness.  And this guy probably goes home because he hangs out with Terry Clifford all day,  really thinking that he is truly outrageous.  Right, right, yeah.  Like, I said some crazy shit today.  Yeah.  One thing about, like, my grandma looking at guys in kilts, like, I can't even get into it. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, man.  I set her off.  Yeah.  Today, look out.  Grandma, you don't want to hear about what happened today.  Yeah, her fucking, her awful, her fucking, her Joni in the later years of Happy Days wig  almost fell off.  Fucking fat, termed idiot.  Oh, Terry Clifford.  She is about a fat piece of shit.  You feel the guilty about that one, Oak? 
[01:41:30]  I like her delivery now.  I'm all in.  Are you?  Yeah, with that.  Oh, Jeremy.  Oh, Jeremy.  Jeremy.  You're on the other hand of the opinion that she's a fat piece of shit.  Just about a fat piece of fucking shit.  What's CMF doing right now?  I'm getting reports.  WCMF, a station I used to work at a long fucking time ago.  Bill Louise used to work for forever.  He has moved on from there as well.  It's all about Jocktober right now.  Now, one of Terry Clifford's staff is threatening a CMF intern that sent Opie Radio a picture 
[01:42:00]  of Terry.  Is that true?  Yeah, I think we're recording.  I think they're trying to get our attention because he said that some intern took a photo  that was listening to ONA while he was interning at this other Rochester station and heard us  making fun of Terry Clifford.  So apparently he went out into the lobby and either took a photo of a photo or he took a  photo of Terry Clifford and tweeted it.  I didn't see the tweet.  I haven't seen the tweet.  But then they started saying that like, yeah, and then Opie and Anthony started talking 
[01:42:30]  about the photo and da-da-da.  Who's saying that photo?  Whatever the morning show hosts are on this other channel.  Maybe they thought we were talking about that photo when we were talking about that other  one that was up yesterday.  Maybe.  With her dumb fucking curly head Harpo Marx wig.  That's who it is.  I would have just toot a fucking horn and then put her into a fucking ditch.  Are you saying her perm is a bit tight?  Oh, blech.  Bit on the tight side.  Horrid perm. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We don't have a squeaky horn anymore.  I need one of those.  Honk.  Yeah, the honky horn.  But we're recording that station.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  But something's going on.  That's it for Terry Clifford.  All right.  Can we maybe get just a tiny taste before the end of Jack-tober?  I feel like...  Depends on your behavior.  I feel like the people demand a little more.  Just a little more.  Just a little.  Just a little.  If everyone behaves themselves, they may get rewarded.  Nice. 
[01:43:30]  But we do have some bonus Jack-tober.  Okay.  Because that's finished up yesterday.  Good.  Because we got very busy.  Remember Prep Burger?  Yeah.  Of course.  Going back to Prep Burger today.  Because not only do they have the Monday songs.  Do we have Monday songs yet from our listeners?  Nobody has.  Is that contest a bust?  Yeah, it's kind of a bust.  Oh, that's too bad.  No, people.  All right.  You throw the shit out there and hope for the best.  We always have Prep Burger.  We try so hard.  We got Prep Burger.  We really do.  Well, Prep Burger has the Monday songs.  Uh-huh. 
[01:44:00]  They also have the Wednesday songs.  Oh, wow.  And bits.  And bits.  Come on.  It's catered to Wednesday.  It is Wednesday.  How fucking stupid.  Who cares?  What?  What is it?  A hump day thing?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Probably some good laughs in here.  Well, no.  I mean, I made it nice and easy for you.  You don't have to make a big deal about it being Prep Burger.  What are you talking about?  This is from my fucking brain.  Good.  Good.  Good.  What are you talking about?  You're right.  Guys, Wednesday's the middle of the week.  You know that, right?  Sure is open. 
[01:44:30]  And it's here.  And this is how you can tell.  And now, signs that you can tell it's Wednesday.  You know it's the middle of the week because people keep saying it's hump day like it's  something special when we all know it's the middle of the friggin' work week.  Nevertheless, it still feels better than Tuesday because it's closer to Friday.  Besides, Tuesday was too damn close to Monday in the first place.  We all know Monday's bite.  And yet, it doesn't feel quite as good as Thursday because that day is one day closer  to the weekend than Wednesday.  But it is the halfway point if we can all start dreaming about sleeping until noon and  getting hammered on Saturday night, which is rather pathetic. 
[01:45:00]  But hey, at least it's Wednesday, right?  This has been Signs That You Can Tell It's Wednesday.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, no.  Chip loved it.  Chip loved it.  I know, right?  I bet I know Chip's favorite part, huh?  When they said...  Getting fucked up on Saturday.  Oh, I figured you liked it when they said Monday's bite.  Oh, that was cool, too.  I can't believe they said that on the radio.  You ever say that to people?  Bite me?  Yeah, I say bite me and buzz off. 
[01:45:30]  Nice.  That's really cool.  Guys, we're paying tribute to hump day.  You know that, right?  What?  With this Wednesday song set to the tune of an actual 1960s radio jingle.  Oh.  So, hit it.  Wednesday, you're annoying as my mother-in-law.  Yeah!  Ho-ho!  No, Opie, I hope she's not listening.  Oh, Opie, Opie! 
[01:46:00]  What is this, 1955 mother-in-law jokes?  What?  What?  Oh.  That gets the people laughing when you make fun of the mother-in-law.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's the honeymooners.  It's a hoot.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Your mother!  So what, if you, um, if you got the prep burger, you get this shit on Wednesdays, huh?  Yeah, you get that, and they give you little setups and everything, and make it all organic.  You don't even have to use your brain to do a radio show.  That's good. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, let's find out who our sponsor is today.  Mine?  Hey there, it's Wednesday, and Wednesday is brought to you by me.  I'm the inconsiderate D-bag who microwaves fish in the company kitchen.  And then, to make it worse when people complain about the stink, I just laughed.  Ha, ha, ha.  Today, I brought leftover scampi.  Fish and garlic.  Mm, mm.  Fuck yeah, don't take shit from nobody.  Oh, man.  Fish bites.  What?  But then someone out there goes, yeah, we got one of those people. 
[01:47:00]  They do that.  Oh, man.  This is terrible.  It's terrible.  It's relatable.  You have to know your audience.  Fuck.  But that's such simple concepts.  Why can't, like, creative people get together and go, all right, it's Wednesday.  Let's do some Wednesday shit.  No.  Because it's much easier to just log on to the website and just see what they got for you today.  That is so sad.  It's terrible.  It's truly terrible.  It really is sad. 
[01:47:30]  Well.  It's not just Wednesday, you know.  I know, Sam.  I know.  I saw the calendar.  You did?  Yes, I did.  You have this date marked on your calendar?  Yes.  And I was excited about it, but then we got a new boss.  Right.  So we can't do this bit anymore.  Right.  You know, it's boss's day.  Did you know that, guys?  It's boss's day.  Ah.  Once a year, it's boss's day, and today is the day for real.  Cool.  But we got rid of our old bosses, so we can't really do much with this.  It shouldn't be today, though, boss's day. 
[01:48:00]  Hmm?  Hmm?  No.  All right.  It should be September 11th, because we hate our bosses.  See?  Oh, holy shit.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Well, I picked a lousy day.  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  I understand where you were going with it.  Yeah.  Wow.  A new study shows that 30% of bosses are more stressed out than they were at this time  last year.  Fun fact?  Yeah.  You need to do fun facts. 
[01:48:30]  I like a good fun fact.  And then, what does all poor babies mean?  No, it...  Oh, I'm supposed to be doing this?  Yeah, you're sarcastic about it.  Oh.  Because, like, we're not the bosses.  Right.  We're the working stiffs, just like Joe Blow is driving to work.  Right.  And we're all like, oh, poor babies.  Oh.  Oh, poor babies.  Hi.  I represent the United Bosses Organization, and we're facing hard times.  A new study shows that bosses are more stressed out than they were a year ago.  And I just want to say, it's true. 
[01:49:00]  Our jobs are stressful.  It's tough to spend so much time trying to figure out how to make your life difficult.  It's exhausting.  Looking through your personal emails just because we can.  Finding creative ways to cut your pay while making you take on more responsibilities.  Oh, it gives me an ulcer.  And don't even get me started on planning all those useless meetings that literally accomplish nothing.  I mean, well, except for giving the illusion that I serve any sort of purpose whatsoever.  Let's just say, that's the reason why I'm losing all my hair.  Well, that and the expensive cigars I buy with money I'm stealing through an elaborate Ponzi scheme that I'm running on all my employees.  Do you think that keeping that secret is easy? 
[01:49:30]  Stress alert.  Whoop, whoop, whoop.  So if you'd like to help, make a donation to the United Bosses Organization.  We'll send you a picture of the boss that you're sponsoring.  Along with monthly updates in the form of bank statements.  Really, really fat, delicious bank statements.  The United Bosses Organization.  Please help today.  This is fucking...  That's a win.  Yes.  You like it, Craig?  Yeah, it's a win.  Oh, God.  That's a win.  It's good.  I swear I tapped out.  What happened?  Well, it's Bosses Day.  Right.  And then what?  I know he represented bosses or something. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Some fake organization.  And then were there jokes in there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A little Bernie Madoff action.  Uh-huh.  Talking about jokes about how rich bosses are.  Okay.  Bald.  Jokes about how bald bosses are.  It's just fun.  If you talk fast and stuff, it doesn't make it funny.  Well, you gotta put this voice on, too.  Well, I just...  You gotta put a funny voice on.  It's hilarious.  You gotta fit as many jokes as you can in before you get back to the music.  I want to know about this fucking sea creature. 
[01:50:30]  I know we gotta pay E-Rock today before Piers Morgan, but what the fuck...  Wait, segue.  Yeah, right.  What the fuck is that?  They're showing it on every news channel.  That's some big fucking fish.  And I'm sure you've seen it on Twitter by now.  What do you mean?  It's like my Pekka.  What is it?  It looks like an eel, but it's a big fish that they found.  No.  Sorry.  Wouldn't a marine biologist say that?  Why are they keeping it a mystery still?  I don't know.  It's 18 feet long, and it looks like a...  Like a...  What?  Like a snake.  Like a eel.  Yeah.  Like a... 
[01:51:00]  Like a giant eel.  Like a giant eel.  What is it, though?  Where are the marine biologists today?  Maybe they're out helping a whale.  Oh, good point.  That's suffocating on a Titleist golf ball.  By the way, you guys with that fucking Seinfeld yesterday.  You motherfucker.  That's right, dude.  No, I knew it was Seinfeld.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, I thought so.  Oh.  But why didn't you say anything then?  Oh, because I was in the...  I didn't want to wreck it.  You didn't want Shatner to catch on.  Yeah.  That fucking video is really funny. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, it did.  That fucking...  You redoing Star Trek II.  The Ratham Kahn Spock death scene with Cappy Kirk there.  Yeah.  He wanted nothing to do with it.  It was funny, dude.  You killed it.  That was so funny.  I'll retweet it.  I love Shatner.  There was a video that I did with William Shatner yesterday,  right after the appearance.  It's really funny.  I'll have it on my Twitter in a few minutes.  But first, we have to check in with the country's biggest boss  because it is boss day today. 
[01:52:00]  Oh.  This is President Barack Obama with the boss's name.  Man, the guy does a bad Obama.  This is President Barack Obama.  You subscribe to Prepper and you're lucky enough  to get a bad impression of Barack Obama?  That's not really him.  God.  A message.  Being President makes me a kind of boss.  So what I want this boss's day  is Congress to get the government back up and running.  I'd like the debt ceiling raised  so the country doesn't go into...  It's the worst impression.  No, it doesn't even sound like him. 
[01:52:30]  No, it doesn't.  At all.  Fult and Amber Riley kept away from the craft services table  and in the rehearsal studio  so we can see a plus-size gal win on Dancing with the Stars.  Sad to say that of those three wishes,  that's the one most likely to happen.  Happy Boss's Day, everybody.  Oh.  It stinks.  That's terrible.  It just stinks.  What about the American music playing behind him?  That's better.  It's fun, right?  It brings it together.  They gotta put it together. 
[01:53:00]  Right.  It's a prep burger.  Jack-tober's weird.  It's like a rollercoaster.  Oh, yeah.  We have so much fun  and then it gets to a point  where we just sit here like getting just angry  that this shit goes on out there.  Dude, it stinks.  And there's no real jokes that we can come up with.  We just get mad.  I know.  You get angry.  Well, because not only is this a show,  this is dozens of shows around the country playing this.  Hundreds.  I would go close to a hundred.  I bet you there's a hundred radio shows  that played that exact bit this morning.  As a straight bit, by the way. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  As if it was their own.  Yeah.  And finally, today is Boss's Day, as we know,  and everybody's trying to get ahead at their job.  A little enthusiasm, please.  This is enthusiasm.  Oh.  But we got in a new sponsor this morning  that just might be the way to do it.  Take a listen and you can decide for yourself.  There's only one real way to get ahead in the workplace.  Suck up to your boss.  And to do that, you've got to get inside his head.  That's why there's supervisor surveillance. 
[01:54:00]  Our private investigators follow your boss around  and find out everything about him,  allowing you to pattern your life after his.  Enough about the boss.  I know.  What the fuck is this?  Who cares?  And you're not a brave radio show.  You know, obviously, no one really likes their boss.  So go down the hall, march down the hall,  kick down his door, and call him a shit dick or something.  Instead of playing these hacking boss bits.  You know, like the boss.  You know what?  Everyone, like, hates the boss. 
[01:54:30]  So we ought to do some, you know, bits for Prep Burger about the boss.  But do your own bits.  Yeah.  Boss's day.  You don't like your boss.  All right.  Figure something out.  Driving in, nodding their head at the radio.  Yeah.  My boss.  That's where I'm going right now,  to deal with one of these fuckers.  Enough.  I have a boss bit idea.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Where we say, you have to call up and say,  my boss sucks a bag of blank dicks. 
[01:55:00]  And then in the blank, you have to insert an ethnicity.  It really doesn't leave much to the imagination.  No, there's ten choices.  Yes.  But you can even do that on regular radio.  Just that setup would get people laughing, at least.  Jesus.  Very funny.  Breathing about him.  Allowing you to pattern your life after his.  Good morning, Johnson.  Good morning, sir.  That sure is a nice tie. 
[01:55:30]  Well, thank you.  But, uh, wait a minute.  You have the exact same tie.  Oh, well, you look at that.  I guess I do.  And the same shirt and pants and glasses  and the same scar on your right cheek.  Before long, you and the boss will be inseparable.  I'm glad we could eat lunch together, Johnson.  You remind me of myself when I was my age.  Thanks.  I guess we're just two of a kind.  Oh, that's good.  I had my wife make me a ham sandwich.  Yeah, I had your wife make me a ham sandwich this morning, too.  What?  What?  Supervisor surveillance.  Call now.  I don't even get the bit. 
[01:56:00]  I do.  What is it?  What happens is everyone has trouble with the boss.  Right.  So if you want to get along better with your boss, you've got to be more like your boss.  Oh.  So these guys follow the boss, and they give him information to be like the boss.  All right, that's fucking stupid.  There it is.  They said inseparable.  They have to be inseparable.  It's inseparable.  Yes.  Oh, well.  Clifford saved October today.  Yes.  The Cliff. 
[01:56:30]  Jerry Clifford.  The Cliff.  The Cliff.  The Cliff says, oh, Jeremy.  Leave Steve alone, though.  Oh, no.  Steve, love you.  Miss you.  We'll be drinking again soon, brother.  The boss bit was a win.  Oh.  I've got to pay E-Rock, but I swear to you, it's not a bit.  I've got to take a leak really bad.  Can we do a single?  I've got to take a leak.  We'll do a single.  We'll do a single, and then come back and pay our suite.  And then, finally, I'm going to move on from the E-Rock travesty. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  It was a horrible mistake, and now, you know, unfortunately, today is make good day.  So, we'll do that next, I swear.  And then, Piers Morgan at 9.15.  Right.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I was quite the rebel. 
[01:57:30]  What happened?  I paid no mind to that fucking cleaning sign that was on the bathroom.  I walked right under it and used one of the toilets downstairs.  Good for you, brother.  Here.  Instead of walking upstairs.  I'm not going to let the man keep me down.  The sound of the trailer for your documentary, Breaking the Rules.  Yes.  You're a real Norma Ray.  It's like I was peeing, sitting down. 
[01:58:00]  It's just stupid.  They clean our stupid bathroom.  Prime time.  I know.  Prime time.  Let's go right in.  That's it.  Go right the fuck in.  Right in the stall.  She's fucking cleaning the next one.  You just...  Just splattering.  You're going to take a nice bourbon shit.  Bourbon.  It's not our fault you did shitty in school.  Yeah.  Deal with this.  Smith's not paying attention in seventh grade. 
[01:58:30]  Well, we got to pay E-Rock or I got to pay E-Rock.  Is it time to pay E-Rock?  Eric.  Yeah.  This pains me today.  This fucking pains me.  I hate being...  I remember how much you hated giving me like $100 because you lost some iPhone bet.  Yeah.  I can't imagine this.  I don't like being... 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  Like Fonzie.  You can't say wrong.  Right.  I was waiting for you.  I get it.  I can't be...  So most people know by now I fucked up really, really badly.  Still wish I would get just a little apology.  Because you really thought I did it on purpose.  And you're lucky enough to hang out with me when I'm not doing radio. 
[01:59:30]  Lucky...  Dr. Who's shirt?  Let me see it.  Kind of cool.  I like the British flag thing.  That is a cool one.  Thank you.  That's a good one.  How about a teeny apology?  No.  Why are you looking at me like a fucking bull ready to charge?  Cool.  That's funny.  It was supposed to be a good day.  Bull ready to charge.  It's been in so many ads I've seen.  So what happened for the people? 
[02:00:00]  Because there are people that don't know.  Believe it or not.  You were on vacation enjoying yourself.  Yes.  And we wanted to play a bit we couldn't find.  So I called you.  And it went right to voicemail.  And then I wasn't paying attention.  And this is the God's honest truth.  And as I was trying to think of something witty to say on your phone.  And then your number went out because you never put a message on your outgoing message thing.  Your fault. 
[02:00:30]  Did you see the way he just explained that?  Because shut up, Sam.  And well, then all hell broke loose.  And you almost quit, right?  I was really tempted.  And I was so pissed off.  Right.  Because this happens every time.  Not that incident.  But something happens every time I'm not here.  Yeah.  And Robert Redford's in a boat movie. 
[02:01:00]  He's got a new boat movie.  Is he in the boat movie?  He's in a boat movie.  Oh, not the boat movie?  No.  I saw the boat movie.  Now I've got to see this one.  So I can still say, I want to see the boat movie.  Right.  But the Robert Redford boat movie.  So the Elbster volunteered generously.  Yes.  I'm taking full responsibility.  Meaning I have to do something.  I can't just say I'm taking full responsibility.  So, you know, we went back and forth a little bit.  I sort of said I would pay for your vacation. 
[02:01:30]  You did?  You said it, yeah.  But then you pumped up the numbers.  So then I decided to crunch my numbers.  They weren't pumped up.  There's receipts for everything.  Oh, boy.  There's a $2,000 phone charge.  What is that?  Well, thanks to Sam and Roland's research, it turns out it would be about $2,000 to get  the new phone.  Yeah, but you know what?  I said that maintaining, that would be the cost if you kept your old phone active, which 
[02:02:00]  you're not doing.  No, it's still active.  I just don't have a phone that's...  The old number's gone.  The old number's gone.  So you have no purpose for a second phone.  Yeah, so I mean...  So that's out the window.  I could cut to the chase.  I knocked that right off the bill.  You didn't need a new phone.  Yes.  Yeah, you just changed the number.  So when the Oapster was crunching numbers at home and thinking long and hard about this,  I decided to knock that right off the fucking bill.  All right.  So you knocked that off. 
[02:02:30]  Yes.  That's right.  Do we have a total from E-Rock before we...  What was the total?  We're not going to go to commercial.  That was all a dumb gag last week.  Go to commercial!  You talked about your vacation ad nauseum, but we were all scared of you that day, so  we allowed you to talk.  Yeah.  And you gave every single fucking detail of your vacation.  And then we left them hanging with the total, just when you were about to give the total.  What was the total? 
[02:03:00]  The total was just over 9,600.  Whoa!  That's just shy of 10 Gs.  You were asking for 10 Gs for that stunt?  A stack of high society.  It wasn't a stunt, you asshole.  Accidental stunt.  Yeah.  So, you know, but I saw the phone thing.  I'm like, okay, that's easy.  That's gone.  That's down to minus 2,000 from 9,600.  So you're getting $7,600.  Very nice.  Right.  Cool.  Good for you.  What?  7,600? 
[02:03:30]  No, no, no.  7,600?  What?  No.  7,000.  What happened?  Well, then I took a little taste.  You took a taste?  Of what?  For allowing him in my world.  Oh, man.  Of a finder's fee?  So I took my taste.  Is that the privilege of getting to know you off the air that you were talking about?  Yes.  I see.  What was your taste?  I took another 2 Gs off it.  My taste.  Oh, I need the whole 9,600, Wade.  So then, you know.  You just got to talk about your finder's fee. 
[02:04:00]  Right.  So I took a little taste.  Yeah.  So $5,600.  Well, I did.  And then you got to round it, I'm sure you rounded it.  Up to 6,000.  Up to 6,000.  No, I'm sure you rounded down.  Then I got to thinking.  I mean, it's not just about the money.  Uh-huh.  I felt like it had to be done in a nice way.  Right.  So he did round out.  So I thought of what you really love.  Your penguin cocks?  One of the things you really love is your weight. 
[02:04:30]  We all know that.  Oh.  How much do you weigh?  You're stalling.  Keep going.  How much is it, though?  I'm guessing about 250 pounds.  When I was crunching numbers.  What?  Wait.  Wait.  These were some of the numbers you were crunching?  Yeah.  I was crunching numbers.  And I thought, he's got to weigh about 250 pounds.  250?  No.  More or less, right?  Close enough?  On the moon.  No.  If I was you, I would admit to 250 right now. 
[02:05:00]  Are you basing poundage per dollar amount or something like that?  No.  No.  $250.  He really crunched some numbers.  I've been crunching and thinking it over.  I wanted to make it special to show that I was very wrong that day.  Uh-huh.  And I also know you like, you love a good vending machine.  You do love chips.  Snacks is your thing.  You love snacks.  A salty snack in the afternoon.  And where does one get snacks?  A vending machine. 
[02:05:30]  Also loves, like, video games.  Yes.  And you love video games.  Anthony, very good.  Yes, he does.  Didn't you go up to that place?  Fun spot.  Fun spot?  Yeah.  So I decided, Iraq, the make good is very simple.  I am paying you your weight in quarters.  There it is.  I am paying your weight in quarters.  There you go. 
[02:06:00]  I am paying your weight in quarters.  Yes.  Is that 250 pounds of quarters?  Yes.  When I crunched the numbers, I figured it was about 250 pounds.  So I figured I would pay him.  Wow.  That is a fuckload of quarters.  There is 10 boxes of quarters at your feet right now, sir.  I want to be mad, but this is funny. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  Each box weighs 25 pounds.  Can you put them up on the counter, Jim Norton?  God almighty.  These are fucking heavy.  I have decided to pay your weight in quarters.  Let me see one of those.  Let me see one of those.  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  You can work out with this.  They're bricks.  They're 25-pound bricks.  That is a good one.  You can work out.  And if you do the math, that would be...  Maybe do some squats or something.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  If you do the math, that would be $5,000 worth of quarters.  Wow.  For my fuck-up.  Five Gs.  Five Gs.  Each box is 500 bucks.  This is a $500 block?  500 bucks per box.  Are these wrapped?  Yep.  Are you sure?  If they're not, we're going to have a lot of fun in about two fucking minutes.  No, they're wrapped.  There's rolls.  Are they?  Here, put them all on the counter.  They weren't wrapped. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, boy.  For the big photo op.  My fucking Twitter's going to explode.  Jesus Christ.  Don't break the fucking counter.  It's 250 pounds.  I don't know how the fuck you're going to get it out of here.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, does he have something to carry him home in?  Pocket change.  No.  You just fill your pockets with the change.  Yeah, just leave them in your desk for when you need a quarter for the vending machine.  You're waiting quarters.  You're waiting quarters.  Yeah, I wouldn't put all of them up there, dude.  Do you think the console could collapse?  Yeah, I don't know if it would collapse.  If someone sits up there at 250 pounds, put them up there. 
[02:08:00]  That's a lot of weight, dude.  Put them up.  Stack them up nice, like in a pyramid or something.  It's distributed.  Yeah, it'll be all right.  The weight's being distributed.  It'll be all right.  Oh, boy.  So there you go, Iraq.  There's your make good.  Wow.  That's really nice.  That's pretty good.  I like it.  Iraq, that's going to be difficult to get home.  Get in front of it.  It's a tad. 
[02:08:30]  And there you have it.  I'm paying Iraq.  It's weighed in quarters.  There's 10 boxes of quarters.  10 boxes of quarters.  That's $5,000 worth of quarters.  Oh, my God.  Each box weighs 200.  If Sam drops it on his foot.  They're really heavy.  Yeah.  Yeah, each box weighs actually 25 pounds.  25 and a half.  25 and a half pounds. 
[02:09:00]  So you're looking at 250 pounds worth of quarters for my phone.  That's crazy.  There you go.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  What do you have to say, Iraq?  I guess thank you.  What do you mean, I guess thank you?  Damn right.  This is kind of a dick move.  What?  Kind of.  This is the big payback.  You're not appreciative, man.  I crunched the numbers.  I thought I would do something very nice for you.  Yeah.  And this was it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're waiting quarters. 
[02:09:30]  I heard he crunched some numbers.  I crunched the numbers, Ant.  Yeah.  A lot of thought into it.  Lucky it wasn't Roland.  Oh, boy.  How about a thank you?  Thank you.  This doesn't quite cover the vacation.  Ooh.  Like you said.  Oh, man.  What an ingrate.  Going for a bit.  I love it.  Iraq, are you happy with the amount of money, like quarters a side?  No.  You're not? 
[02:10:00]  No.  He's not.  He just gave you $5,000 because he accidentally gave your phone on the air, and you're not happy  with that amount?  Well, you had his heart set on something.  What did he have his heart set on?  Well, I had my heart set on.  It was you.  Yeah, exactly.  You giving what you promised on the air.  All right.  Take the quarters back, Kenny.  Oh, man.  I'm going to grab one box for me.  I'll take a box.  Hey, fucking Sam.  Goes to rip them off.  These are good to work out with. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Ooh.  Right?  All right.  I have to move these.  This is starting to bend.  What is?  What's bending?  The castle's looking a little...  I don't know what the castle's looking at.  I thought the floorboards...  Oh, jeez.  Oh, Eric.  Eric, you weigh 250 pounds, huh?  No.  Yeah, his weight in quarters.  I thought that was a very nice gesture on my part.  That's very nice.  Thank you, Anthony.  I appreciate it.  And it shows how much you know your friend.  Thank you, Sam.  I appreciate it.  How many of us know what our friends weigh like that?  Right.  And now you've got plenty of quarters to play video games and go to the vending machines. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  It's beautiful.  All these quarters are going to be gone by noon, though.  Here you go.  Go buy some fucking candy.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  That's a lot of Pop-Tarts.  How do you get them home?  Yeah, I don't know.  How about a thank you?  Well, Eric, as time goes on, after you know what's happened now, are you feeling better  or worse?  Eric, comment.  Actually, this has not helped at all. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, man.  This has not helped.  You're not happy at all.  No.  No.  Well, this is the end of my participation.  I think you've paid your debt.  It ends here.  Thank you, Sam.  It's $5,000.  Yeah.  But, Iraq, what you're thinking?  This ends right here.  This doesn't cover what he said he would.  Oh, wow.  And, too, this is not very convenient.  What do you mean it's not convenient?  You love quarters.  That shit spends.  It's very thoughtful.  Kenny is right.  Opie obviously did put a lot of thought into it. 
[02:12:00]  I did.  Paying your weight in quarters.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  That's a nice sentiment.  That wasn't what you said, though.  Ooh.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I'd like to fucking hear a recording of that shit.  All right.  We'll pull that Friday show where you said you would cover my vacation.  Jesus Christ.  I think there were some things on that vacation that shouldn't have been covered anyway.  When he was reading off the list.  Thank you, Ant.  It was on the list.  Thank you.  There were some things that were a little...  I'm so glad we're getting along lately.  The dinner and stuff.  This is really helping me out. 
[02:12:30]  Thank you, sir.  I told you that!  Thank you, sir.  He put his mouse ears on the thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of that stuff.  You heard it, right?  I heard.  There were some things...  When I was crunching the numbers, I'm like, yeah, it's a $5,000 vacation.  And at the time, it was like...  He didn't go to the goddamn Caribbean.  We didn't want to say anything because he was, you know...  Yeah.  He was hurting.  First day back.  He was hurting.  But I think, you know, for the actual vacation and then the airfare and stuff, man.  Five Gs is probably appropriate to cover at Disney World.  Piers is here.  Piers Morgan is here.  Piers is here. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, he's going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the lavatory.  Y-Rock, will you get all this mess out of here?  Why, Y-Rock, you're messy.  Yeah, Y-Rock, what are you doing?  Why is he mad?  Well, you know...  What the fuck?  He's just got $5,000.  That's $5,000!  Are you mad that Opie cut a little off the top for himself?  Uh-oh, someone's saying it's actually $4,982.  Ew.  Why is that?  No way.  Why is that, Kevin?  What do you got on this?  All right.  So, the average quarter weighs 5.59 grand. 
[02:13:30]  Kenny's had it.  No, it's actually over 250 pounds of quarters.  Right.  We just rounded it off.  I weighed the fucking things, and I loved them from the bank to here.  Wow.  All right?  So, go fuck yourself.  Each box weighs over 25 pounds.  It's 25.5 pounds each box.  It's wrapped quarters in cardboard.  So, that's another five.  That's what he didn't take into consideration.  So, it's over 250 pounds. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  That's Kenny's.  Kenny.  What?  That's Kenny's hand cart that you brought him in with, right?  Yeah.  Kenny needs to take that home.  Yeah.  That's Kenny's.  You can't have that.  You can't have that.  That's Kenny's equipment.  Well, no.  He can have it for like $500.  He can buy it.  A box of quarters.  Yeah.  He can buy it.  Eric, I think we'd all be willing to help you bring these out for a fee.  Yeah.  No.  We should finish this before Pierce comes, because he'll be all confused.  250 pounds?  Right.  Wait a minute.  That's only $500. 
[02:14:30]  American.  See?  Because...  Well, I know I did the right thing.  Wow.  Iraq is still pissed.  I don't care.  I will sleep well at night.  I thought this was very thoughtful.  Extremely thoughtful.  You spent more than that on your vacation.  There was thought put into it.  A lot.  But I don't know if it was thoughtful.  It's very thoughtful.  Oh, I see why you're...  Because not only did you not get how much you want, but he also took the time to say,  I'll bet Iraq weighs more than 250 pounds. 
[02:15:00]  Well, I mean, your weight worked out in your favor today.  True, actually.  I thought you weighed about 250.  Who didn't?  If I thought 220, then it would have been 220 pounds a quarter.  That would have been a lot less money.  And if he was going to be a dick about it, he could have paid you in pennies.  Oh, man.  Which we looked into.  Damn.  We did look into the pennies.  That's a lot of pennies.  It was so obnoxious.  I forgot how many boxes it was going to be.  That's a lot of pennies, man.  It was going to be something like 100 boxes. 
[02:15:30]  That was a former card delivery.  No joke.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's early, so...  Yeah, we did think pennies.  But in the end, quarters seem to be more than acceptable.  You're pissed, though, huh?  Well, that's not my problem.  I know.  I know I did the right thing.  Oh, good for you.  Frederick Hughes is looking down on me today.  Saying, son, you did the right thing.  Way to go, son.  Way to go, son.  That's right.  You paid him.  Remember when I told you...  Frederick Hughes.  Remember when I told you that you can't act like everything's okay before you get the thing? 
[02:16:00]  The moolah.  Because then you end up with a whole bunch of quarters.  $5,000 of quarters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  And what, are you going to be pissed now?  You were not pissed yesterday.  And you didn't have all those quarters.  And you're kind of smiling.  He's okay.  Is he doing a bit?  A little bit.  He is, right?  He'll be all right.  He'll be just fine.  And I think the apology still is more than reasonable. 
[02:16:30]  Because then I'm a good guy.  I could think of 5,000 reasons to give Opie an apology, quite frankly.  You'd take $5,000 worth of quarters, right, Sam?  Holy shit.  Sam, boo!  I want one of those boxes now.  Right.  This guy's saying if I really brought in E-Rock's weight in quarters, you'd be able to retire.  See, that's not nice.  I think I had it figured out at $250.  Not very accurate.  So many quarters.  Yeah.  Bro, you got five grand.  That's wonderful. 
[02:17:00]  Like, what's the problem?  What's the issue here?  Yeah, what is the issue?  Most people would have not made me even give him a fucking dollar knowing that it was by accident.  It's in quarters.  How am I going to get this out of here?  We'll help you.  We'll help you.  It would be great if there was just one quarter on the top of each one where the holes are  in the bottom, and the rest is just bricks or something.  He gets home and opens it up.  Like the old school scam? 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  The old New York City scam?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what he's complaining about.  It's not like it's loose change.  Yeah, it's all wrapped up nice.  It is wrapped up nice.  You give him a documentary.  It's silly.  All right.  Beat it.  Very good.  Scram.  Scram.  We got to bring our guests.  Yeah, we got to bring in Piers.  Go get your fucking shine box.  Go get your quarters box.  Get your ten shine boxes.  By the way.  You enjoyed your week off of bashings.  I think it's okay over there.  By the way, you're welcome.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  He didn't even say thank you, did he?  Ladies and gentlemen.  You're welcome.  As we make way here for the lovely and talented Piers Morgan.  Thank you, sir.  What's up, Piers Morgan?  Chaps.  We're chaps today.  Look at what's going on behind you.  That's $5,000 worth of quarters on the floor, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that my fee?  Yes.  Yeah, there you go.  Is that your fee?  You had to take care of some business before you came in here today?  I was just checking how it's done on you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I heard you guys were buddy-buddies over there. 
[02:18:30]  We were pretty pally over there.  He was at the warm-up for the main grilling here.  We got reports that you guys were buddy-buddy over there.  It was actually surprisingly friendly, yeah.  You've got to go back on that show.  Well, I said to him, what we should really have is me, Howard, and Alex Jones.  Oh, God.  Let me tell you something.  1776 is where you're going back to.  That's what we need to do.  You know, the...  I saw that one.  That was pretty fun.  Yeah.  That debate you guys had. 
[02:19:00]  It was really calm.  It was really respectable back and forth.  It was great.  It was great TV.  I want you back in America's Got Talent.  Yeah.  For real.  Thank you.  Because I don't watch the show anymore.  Because you were way better.  That is a fact.  I ran out of words to tell people they suck.  Right.  You had it with that show?  Well, I did six seasons in America, and I did four of the British Britain's Got Talent.  And it just comes to a point when you can't think of anything you need to say about somebody  who's murdering, you know, raise me up.  Right.  You try, but you raise me up.  Oh, for God's sake, give me strength. 
[02:19:30]  You know.  Piers.  Now, we had a little thing.  Yes.  And we're going to have some more things today.  Good.  I actually like watching you.  I really do.  Because you do fucking tackle some tough fucking subjects.  But it frustrated me that you don't acknowledge the media and their responsibility in these  school shootings.  Yeah, but I do.  I do acknowledge some responsibility.  But have you talked about it on the show?  Yeah, but see, I don't agree with your central premise.  Because if you take your argument to its logical extension, then the media would never  cover any mass shootings at all.  That is a problem.  And I agree with you there.  And you can't have a situation where you just simply don't report bad news because you think 
[02:20:00]  it may encourage other people to do it.  But I think it's the way you guys do it.  And show his face a million fucking times.  And there's a slick graphic.  And it's the music.  And the guy looks almost like a rock star when you see that on TV.  I think it's an inescapable way of doing these stories.  You can't ignore the person that's committed the crime.  Right.  If you go back to his dream years.  Why is it inescapable, though?  We'll just say that.  Not to interrupt you.  It's the way it's pushed forward, I think, is where we have the problem.  Because here's the thing.  It's funny.  Anderson Cooper at CNN would agree with you.  He often doesn't like naming the names of the shooters. 
[02:20:30]  I have a different view.  I come from a British newspaper background.  I think that you need to find out every spit and cough of these people.  I want to know everything about them.  I want to know what triggered the thought process to go into a school or a movie theater and slaughter dozens of Americans.  And if it means you have to show their picture repeatedly so that some people watch and go, I know that guy.  I remember him.  He I remember that guy in an incident on the beach in, you know, 1986.  It's worth it. 
[02:21:00]  Now, it's a necessary evil.  Do you think they'll that'll push other people to do exactly the same thing?  You never know.  I mean, the FBI profilers have said yes.  There's certainly you cannot rule out that there is a danger of copycats doing that.  I would love to have you have you would have.  I would love for you to have a discussion.  We're having it.  That's why I'm here.  But on your show.  I came into the lion's den.  It's a very debate.  We're easy.  The press really does refuse to truly like you.  You're acknowledging it because you're smart and we're talking about it.  But they to them, the payoff on people watching what they're doing is much more important than the absolute risk of encouraging other people because they're they do that for that reason. 
[02:21:30]  It's easy to say.  But what would you do if you were covering you covered on CNN?  What would you cover?  What I cover is like when there's something like a shooting.  It's absolute news.  You have to cover it.  It's a real story.  And you name the guy?  Of course you do.  You show his picture?  Maybe for the first day.  Sure.  Because it is a part of the story.  We're not talking about don't cover it.  So what don't you do?  It's when it begins to go into the second day where it's all that nonsense about why did he do it. 
[02:22:00]  He did it because he's I'll tell you why he's he's crazy.  That's why he did it.  I'm not interested.  Do you ever let me ask you?  You're not interested in finding out why people commit mass shootings?  When there's a rape.  Maybe that's why there are so many in this country.  Let me ask you.  Not enough people do care enough.  When there's a rape.  Do you guys say why did he do it?  You don't care why he did it.  He's a rapist and he's an animal.  Nobody says about a rapist or a child molester.  Why did he molest those children?  No, I can't have this because here's why I can't have this.  Because sometimes the trigger may be violent video games, right? 
[02:22:30]  Which 99% of the people that play them and we know this from statistical evidence.  It has no problem or no effect on.  But no one can tell me, given the pattern of mass shooters in America in recent years, that there is negligible or zero connection between somebody like Adam Lanza sitting in his little lair, watching these horrific violent video games all day long, anesthetizing himself to mass killings.  It has to play a tiny part.  I don't think it's a big part. 
[02:23:00]  Okay, let me go with that.  I think it doesn't help.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me see.  He might be connected to violent videos and some form of mental health problem.  The next mass shooter might have an entirely different thing.  He may have been abused as a kid or whatever it may be.  You have to get to the bottom of what triggers each of these mass shootings.  But the violent video game angle, okay?  What is it about him?  Do you think it has zero impact, seriously, to anybody in the world?  I don't know if it's zero, but I think it's so minuscule that it's not even on a fucking...  It should be on anyone's radar.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I got a second point and then let's go with this. 
[02:23:30]  So the rest of the world plays violent video games.  So why aren't they in the same situation with all these mass shootings?  Well, the rest of the world doesn't have the gun availability that America has.  Now you got him.  Now you got his attention.  There are some countries that have a lot more guns than the United States.  Where do you name one?  Afghanistan.  Has more guns than the United States of America?  Absolutely.  Do you know how many guns you've got in America?  Yeah, probably one or two for one and a half per person.  One and a half per person?  You've got 305 million guns in circulation, according to latest reports. 
[02:24:00]  Do you think there's more than that in Afghanistan?  Probably.  Have you ever been to Afghanistan?  No.  Let me reassure you.  I know there's a war going on there.  There are not 300 million guns in Afghanistan.  Let me reassure you.  Or anywhere near it.  America has the highest volume of guns of any country in the world.  And let me spell out some more statistics for you about guns.  I come from Great Britain.  As you know, right?  My accent has annoyed you numerous times.  But let me tell you this, though.  Here's where I have a real issue with the gun rights people. 
[02:24:30]  Well, let's get into the per cavity.  The British population is about 60 million.  America's is 315 million.  Okay, so you're about five times the size of my country.  We have 35 gun murders a year.  You have 11,000 to 12,000.  And unless I'm wrong, five times 35 is not 11,000 to 12,000, right?  I understand.  So do you accept as a country that you have an unacceptable level of gun death and violence?  It's a lot of gun death and violence.  Well, any gun death would be any unnecessary or unjust gun death. 
[02:25:00]  So what do you do about it?  What do you do about it?  Yeah.  Well, maybe we should curtail some of the gang problems that make up more than half of those stats.  Do you think selling assault rifles in Walmart is a good idea?  Well, assault rifles aren't even used in most of the crimes that you're talking about.  Actually, they've been used in 95% of the mass shootings in America since I've been here.  There haven't been many mass shootings.  Mass shootings don't matter to you?  No, they do matter.  But as far as statistics go... 
[02:25:30]  Sandy Hook, AR-15.  Aurora, AR-15.  Personally, right.  Personally.  Why are they using AR-15s?  And emotionally, it's very...  There's a lot of pressure on people to look at assault rifles like you are.  Why does a civilian need assault rifles?  Tell me.  Why do you think the police need them?  Because they're police.  Because they're police.  That's not an answer.  The police and military...  If I want to protect my home as good as the police,  need to protect themselves and the general public, 
[02:26:00]  why don't I have the right to do that?  Why don't you use tanks?  Because those are...  You've got to have some type of balance.  So you need restrictions?  There are restrictions.  Right.  It appears there are.  Why are there restrictions?  Because the Supreme Court said,  with the Second Amendment ruling in 2008 or 2009,  whenever it was,  they said there needs to be reasonable restrictions, right?  My argument is not about taking anybody's guns away.  Now it's unreasonable.  I have never asked for any confiscation of any gun.  No, confiscation is one thing.  Nor...  Elimination is another.  Wait, let me finish.  Do you know I can't buy an AR-15 here in New York anymore?  Right, good. 
[02:26:30]  I'm not allowed to.  No, not good.  Why not good?  They took my gun to it.  Why do you want an AR-15 assault rifle?  Because, like I said,  I want to protect my house  as well as the police  protect their jurisdiction,  their precincts,  the people that they protect.  When they show up to a shooter  in a school, let's say,  they show up...  They don't show up with a pistol,  a 9mm.  They show up with an assault rifle,  as they're called.  How would you protect your schools? 
[02:27:00]  How would I protect my schools?  I think armed citizens  are a great deterrent.  Every teacher?  Not every teacher.  How many would you arm?  I think in a school,  you would arm people  that have gone through proper training  and psychological profile,  much like a police officer would have to.  That type of thing.  But an armed citizenry...  Where would you put the guns?  You could put them on the teacher.  A concealed carry weapon...  My child...  I've got four kids.  My youngest is nearly two. 
[02:27:30]  She goes to elementary school.  I'm sending my child  into an elementary school  where half the teachers  are wandering around  packed with heat.  Not half the teachers.  How many?  However many...  How many do you want?  However many are responsible  and have taken  whatever training they need  to safely use a weapon.  What happens if they drop their gun  and one of the children  picks it up and shoots  one of their other children?  Well, that's very irresponsible.  I'd say.  And that could happen with...  Do you know how many people  accidentally shoot people  in America every single day?  Yeah.  Do you know how many kids  in the last two months alone 
[02:28:00]  have killed other kids  because adults have been irresponsible?  It's less than drown  in backyard pools, Pierce.  It's less...  So what is what?  It's just...  Yeah, less than dying...  You blow off other stats  as so what  and then your stats  are the important ones  that should be looked at.  You want to liken  the deaths in swimming pools  from accidental drowning  to the deaths in schools  from assault rifles.  You can't look...  Are you really being that facile?  Not assault rifles.  First of all,  let's separate the assault rifle  which is barely used in crimes. 
[02:28:30]  Apart from the last  seven of nine mass shootings  in America.  Mass shootings.  Add up the gang violence  that has killed  tens of thousands  with handguns.  Sure.  Illegal handguns  in Chicago, Detroit,  New York, L.A.  Massive problem too.  Not massive problem too.  Much bigger problem  than assault weapons  in schools.  You may think that  20 kids being killed  in a much of a school  is not as important  as gang violence in Chicago.  If we're talking numbers...  I don't agree with you.  If we're talking numbers,  let's take the cherubish faces 
[02:29:00]  out of the whole thing  and just talk numbers.  Now let's keep  the cherubish faces  in this thing.  Let me tell you why.  Why?  Let me explain.  They are more important  than the young black faces  in inner cities  that are being shot  every weekend?  Now you're sounding ridiculous.  No, I'm not.  I'm sounding like  a logical human being.  Let me have my say  about why I feel strongly  about the mass shooting situation.  Ah, right.  So in Britain in 1996,  there was a massacre  in Dunblane in Scotland.  16 five-year-old children  were murdered by a gunman.  As a result,  Britain came together, 
[02:29:30]  left and right.  It was never a partisan debate,  never conservative  v. liberal over guns.  The media came together,  driven by the paper  that I was editor-in-chief of.  The public came together  and said,  we cannot have this happening  in our society.  We banned all assault rifles,  all assault weapons,  all handguns.  Since that day,  there hasn't been  a single school shooting  in Britain.  Since that day,  there's been one mass shooting  by some loner  who killed about  eight, nine people.  Other than that,  zero mass shootings.  We have 35 gun murders a day.  You'll have that many  today and tomorrow 
[02:30:00]  in America.  A year, you mean?  A year.  A year, yeah.  35 a year.  You have that many a day.  Australia, the same year,  96, in Port Arthur  in Tasmania,  had a massacre,  36 people killed.  And they also banned  all assault weapons  and numerous handguns.  They haven't had,  having had a series  of mass shootings,  they haven't had  a single mass shooting  since 96 in Australia.  No, but they have  a lot of home invasions.  Here's my other point.  Here's my other point.  Yeah?  You look at Japan,  Germany,  Britain, Australia.  You wouldn't find  four countries 
[02:30:30]  which have a greater  history of gun violence  in the world  than those four countries,  right?  Other than America.  The only one  of all those countries  which has never  dealt with gun violence  is America.  And in fact,  it's getting worse  because there are  ever more guns  in circulation.  They're ever more powerful.  They can kill  ever more people  in one go.  And here's why  I say that.  The Sandy Hook shooting  was the single worst  single shooting  of people  in a school  in American history.  The Aurora movie  theater massacre  was the single 
[02:31:00]  highest volume  of people,  Americans,  hit by one person  in a civilian  mass shooting  in American history.  These things  are getting worse  and bigger  and the scale  more dramatic.  What will it take  before eventually  there can be  a reasonable debate,  and I mean reasonable,  in America  about how you  try and reduce  mass shootings,  gang violence,  and general  accidental death  by gun?  different subjects.  You can't just  blame the hardware.  It all comes down  to the gun.  No, it doesn't.  It does. 
[02:31:30]  No, it doesn't.  Because in countries  like Britain,  Germany, Japan,  and Australia,  where they have  basically removed guns,  there is no gun crime  and no gun death.  Britain, first of all,  per capita, of course,  we've got to look  at the population difference.  It's a fifth of the  size of America.  I understand,  but it has a much...  So what do you mean  per capita?  I'm saying per capita,  it has a higher  violent crime rate  than the United States.  Do you really believe that?  Yes, I do.  It's statistic...  Have you ever been to Britain?  No, I haven't,  but I know statistically...  You believe Britain  is a more violent country  than America?  More violent crimes. 
[02:32:00]  Assaults.  It's the problem  with the debate  in this country.  It's so ludicrous.  Of course it doesn't.  It's not ludicrous.  And the bottom line  of the whole thing is...  I don't think you even  believe that.  Well, what are the stats?  You're both saying ludicrous.  What are the stats?  Well, I don't...  I don't have them  off the top of my head.  Let me spell out for you  about Britain.  So it's in perspective.  It's not about me  telling Americans  how to lead their lives.  Britain has appalling records  on things like  teenage knife crime, right?  Teenage obesity,  underage pregnancies,  general yobbery 
[02:32:30]  and disrespect  and stuff like that.  I feel very exercised  about all those issues  in my country.  But the one thing  we got right,  and which I think  is particularly relevant  to America,  is gun funds.  And I say to you guys again,  I don't want to grab  anybody's gun.  I don't want to take  anybody's gun away.  I'm talking about  going forward.  What type of guns  do you think should come?  As they get ever more  powerful and militarized,  at what point  does reasonable restrictions mean  you can't go to a Walmart  in many cities in America  where I can't buy 
[02:33:00]  a Kinder Surprise egg  because the little toys  inside the chocolate  may choke me?  I can't buy  six packets of Sudafed  because I might be  building some illegal  pharmacy.  I can't buy  French cheese  because of the  bacterial threat  to my life.  But instead of those,  I can buy an AR-15  assault rifle  and then get on the  internet,  order 6,000 rounds  of ammunition,  and go and shoot up  a school or movie theater.  At what point  does America  wake up and say  we have to be doing  more to protect lives? 
[02:33:30]  That's my only question.  We have to do more  to weed out  the people  that are insane.  But you don't even  allow background checks.  The Senate refused  to even pass  background checks.  40% of all gun  trades in America  have no background check.  That means you can be  mentally insane  and or criminal  and buy any gun  you like.  Why would anyone  be opposed  to 100%  universal background checks?  I don't think  a lot of people  are opposed.  In New York here, 
[02:34:00]  I have to go through  background checks  whenever I buy a weapon  here in New York.  Why do you think  gun crime in New York  is plummeting  to record lows?  Because the NYPD  does a great job  with the gangs  around here,  which are a huge problem  with gun violence.  Michael Bloomberg  and Rudy Giuliani  and other mayors  in this city  took it on  head on.  And Chicago's problem  is as much to do with  not as good  law enforcement  as New York.  They're not enforcing 
[02:34:30]  the laws that are in place.  I agree with you.  I agree with you.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  The laws that are in place  should be taken care of.  Going after legal,  law-abiding gun owners  in this country  is not the thing  to do.  It's not going to help  lower any crimes.  Of course it is.  No, it's not.  Let me give you an example  of legal gun owners.  Adam Lanza's mother  was a legal gun...  The most irresponsible woman  with her guns.  With legally owning a gun,  comes great responsibility. 
[02:35:00]  That's the thing.  Education,  training,  things like that.  You know why she bought them?  You can't just...  You know why she had  six weapons  including an AR-15?  I hear she was  some type of a survivalist  and liked having a...  Doomsday prepper.  Not really.  She was an NRA member  and she just believed  that actually  the NRA were right.  If you arm yourself,  you will protect yourself.  Unfortunately,  she had a crazed son  with an addiction  to violent video games,  a loner,  a misfit.  That's a little...  It may be of zero relevance 
[02:35:30]  or maybe it's not.  We don't actually know.  Some nut could look  at a Monet  and think,  I gotta kill somebody now.  Yep.  It's because they're crazy.  You can't look at the video game  at the hardware use,  the gun,  the this,  the that.  Let's look at the actual problems.  What happened after Sandy Hook  in terms of gun sales in America?  Well, they skyrocketed.  Way up.  How do you feel about that?  Because people are afraid  that their right  to own these guns  are gonna be taken away.  What about the right  of those children  not to be murdered?  Well, exactly.  Well, exactly what? 
[02:36:00]  Something has to be done  about that.  What do you do, though?  Because actually  three things were proposed.  Well...  A new assault weapons ban,  a ban on high-capacity clips  that were over 10 bullets,  right?  And also universal background checks.  All three of those things...  And you think that's gonna  eliminate school shootings?  I think it might help.  I don't think so.  All three of them  got thrown out.  So the reaction from America  to the worst school shooting  in its history,  unlike in Britain  where we banned  all assault weapons  and handguns,  was zero.  Not even background checks.  In fact, 
[02:36:30]  the fastest-selling weapon  in America  in the four months  after Sandy Hook  was the exact same AR-15  that Adam Lanzi used  to blow those kids' brains out.  Because we knew  it was being taken away from us.  But what an astonishing reaction  from the great superpower  of the world.  Why not?  Why wouldn't you,  if you know they're gonna  be taken away  and you want one  to protect your life  and your family's life  and your house  as well as the police can,  why wouldn't you want  to get one  before they're taken away  like they were in New York, 
[02:37:00]  like they were in this state,  you cannot buy one now  because Cuomo decided...  But it's made New York  a safer place.  No, it hasn't.  Yes, it has.  Assault weapons.  Look at the crime stats  for assault weapons.  You can't even find them.  Look at the murder rates  in New York.  What about it?  Look at the gun crime  in New York.  Stop and frisk help  with that too.  Gun murder rates.  Stop and frisk help  with that too.  Exactly.  Which is going away.  But to take the right  of a New York American citizen  to take his right  to own...  To have an AR-15.  To have an AR-15, 
[02:37:30]  a weapon that is preferred to...  Oh, I say balls to that right.  The founding fathers...  You can't say balls  to that right.  I just said it,  and here's why.  It's the Second Amendment...  The founding fathers  never intended civilians  to wander around  the streets of America  carrying AR-15  killing machines.  Really?  How do you know  what they meant?  You think they did?  I think they saw  weaponry advance  in their lifetime  enough to know  that it was going  to keep happening,  and they didn't put  a clause in there  that said...  You accept there  should be restrictions.  And a musket  was the cutting-edge  weapon of the time.  How long did it take  to reload a musket? 
[02:38:00]  They didn't relegate...  Do you know how long?  It took a long time.  How long?  At least a minute, right?  Nah, somebody could do  it pretty fast.  30 seconds or not.  30 seconds.  Imagine how many people  you would kill  in a movie theatre  if you had to reload  per bullet 30 seconds.  But do you understand  they knew that  technology was going  to advance.  They didn't put anything  in the Second Amendment  that says up until  this point of technology.  Are you aware  of the history  of how the Second Amendment  was interpreted  legally in this country? 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yes.  Believe me.  So you're aware  that for 95%  of its lifespan,  the interpretation  was not that  an individual  had the right  to bear arms  but that an individual  had the right  to bear arms  as part of a  well-regulated militia.  You're aware  of how the NRA  hijacked the meaning  of that in the mid-70s.  Reagan became president.  He was an NRA supporter  and as a result  of that pressure  that began to pile on  the Supreme Court  eventually said  a few years ago  okay, it actually  relates to individuals.  It was hijacked 
[02:39:00]  by the NRA.  Who supports the NRA?  It wasn't hijacked  by the NRA.  No, because the history  first of all...  Who supports the NRA?  Who supports the NRA?  Who pays their money?  Legal gun owners?  No.  Yeah.  Well, partly a suspicion.  Who gives them  the bulk of their money  to go after politicians  who support gun safety?  The gay community.  Lobby groups for...  No, you're missing  their number one funders.  Who is it, Piers?  The gun manufacturers.  Oh, sure.  Why wouldn't they?  They're in business. 
[02:39:30]  Exactly.  So when Wayne LaPierre  goes out after Sandy Hook  and says  only every teacher  had been armed,  they don't even want  an AR-15,  guess what happens?  They sell more guns.  You don't think  other organizations  get money from companies?  How do you feel  about the NRA  targeting politicians  who support  reasonable gun control?  It's never reasonable  gun control, first of all.  If they're targeting  a politician,  it's unreasonable  gun control.  So removing any type  of assault weapon  from civilian hands  is not reasonable to you?  I don't want that, no.  Really?  No, I like the idea 
[02:40:00]  that I am able to have  the same weapon  that the police have  to protect...  But you don't, though,  because they're allowed  fully automatic machine guns.  Absolutely.  So why are they allowed  those and you don't care?  Again, there's a restriction  on that.  But you're happy  with that restriction?  No, I'm actually not.  You're just not happy  with the other restrictions?  I would like to have  a fully automatic weapon.  You'd like a fully automatic  machine gun?  Yes, I would.  And you'd be comfortable  with everybody else  in America having one, too?  If they are trained  and go through  a background check, sure.  And mentally sane  or criminal?  That's kind of hard to...  How are you going to know  if they are not having  background checks? 
[02:40:30]  Right, who is going to...  How are you going to know  without background checks?  Well, I like background checks.  I said that.  You want universal background checks.  I'm for background checks.  I'm for background checks.  I like them.  Yeah, I know.  I don't agree with everything  the NRA does.  I'm not going to sit here  and agree with everything.  Let's try and get to it.  This is a good debate.  Let's get to a point of consensus.  You would agree  with universal background checks?  Yeah, I always said  background checks are fine.  I like that.  What do you feel  about the need to have  magazines that have  more than 10 bullets?  I like a 30-round mag.  Why?  Well, again,  the police don't go out  with 10-round mags.  Why would you need one?  You know what? 
[02:41:00]  For home protection,  I like the idea of...  You think 10 people  are going to come?  You're not going to hit  everybody with it.  And it sounds ridiculous.  You go hunting with, say,  a 100-bullet magazine?  I'm not a hunter.  But should hunters  use 100-bullet magazines  to shoot deer?  No, if you're going out hunting,  it's a whole different thing  than home protection.  That's not hunting, though, is it?  No, I'm not saying.  Why can't a simple handgun  be used at home  to protect a family?  As I've always said in America,  with the volume of guns  you have here,  I've never been against that.  It could be.  I'm known as this  great gun-drabber from Britain.  I've always respected  the rights of an American 
[02:41:30]  to have a simple handgun  at home  if they absolutely needed it.  But here's the other thing.  Wherever there are guns  in homes in America,  there is a higher rate  of gun suicide  of accidental gun crime.  Well, of course,  because there's a gun  in the home.  That's my point.  Well, I would say this, too.  If you go out in the ocean,  you have a much better chance  of being bitten by a shark  than if you're on land.  It's one of those statements  that, of course,  if there's a gun in the house,  there's going to be  a better chance  of somebody getting hurt  with it accidentally  or using it in a suicide. 
[02:42:00]  But many more crimes  have been thwarted  that's rarely ever reported.  Do you believe that,  given that there are  more and more guns  being sold in America,  do you believe that  within 10 years,  if you have another  100 million firearms  in circulation,  the gun murder rate  will be up or down?  I think that has to do with,  more to do with society  than it does hardware.  What does your gut feeling tell you?  My gut feeling tells me  with all the pandering  that goes on in this country,  especially with the issues  of gang violence, 
[02:42:30]  that if it keeps on track,  the murder rate would go up.  But it has nothing to do  with the hardware.  It has nothing to do  with the tool being used.  It has to do with  a violent society.  On the same day  as Sandy Hook in China,  a lunatic went crazy  with a knife in a school.  Right.  He stabbed 20 children.  Uh-huh.  You know the difference?  Yeah, like one kid died.  No, they all lived.  Oh, they all lived?  Yeah, I knew it was  much lower than...  So when you say  you can't blame the gun  or the hardware,  actually you can,  because in China  those guns are banned.  You can't blame the gun 
[02:43:00]  for the lunacy  that makes these people  do these horrible acts.  Why wouldn't you  with every fiber...  Are you a parent?  No.  Right.  Any parents here?  Okay.  I've got four kids.  Why wouldn't you?  How many kids have you got?  Two.  Right.  Why wouldn't you  want to try and make it  as difficult as possible  for the Adam Lanzes,  the slightly crazy people  who, by the way,  have not had direct treatment  for mental health issues,  so haven't been flagged up  on the system?  There were red flags on him.  There were red flags,  but they weren't on paper. 
[02:43:30]  He hadn't been  into a mental institution.  That same point,  can I just jump in?  That same point you're making,  which is a valid point  about why wouldn't you do this  for your own children,  the press should take  that attitude  when it comes to doing things  that are encouraging  future shooters  like covering it  the way you guys do.  Yeah, but you're talking  about chicken and the egg.  No, I'm not.  You can blame the press afterwards.  You can blame  the violent video games afterwards.  I'm not trying to...  You guys are talking about guns.  I'm always saying  the press has been reprehensible  and as passionately  as you discuss violent video games,  you should be talking  about the press  and the way they have  pushed us forward.  My kids play some of these games, 
[02:44:00]  Grand Theft Auto  and whatever, right?  I don't have an issue  with violent video games  if they are,  as they are,  hugely popular or whatever.  I have an issue  where I see a pattern  of these young...  At the moment in America,  you have a pattern  of young white mass shooters  in their early 20s,  loners, misfits,  who happen to be  always playing  a lot of violent video games.  ...compared to black gang members  in their cities.  I agree, but they are  completely different issues  to tackle  and they should be  tackled in different ways.  No, because they're not  completely different issues 
[02:44:30]  with gun grabbers.  Take Chicago.  They want to take all the...  lump them together  as gun violence  and take guns away  from legal gunners.  No, here's what...  And by the way,  you have kids and stuff  and you like them protected.  Do you have that armed security  that goes around  your neighborhood?  No.  What was that sign  on your...  supposedly on your front lawn?  It was a link  to the Beverly Hills  Police Department.  I presume you don't  have a problem  with the Beverly Hills  people being armed?  No, no, being armed.  Nor do I.  That's fine.  Nor do I.  You've never been protected  by an armed guard?  No.  Anywhere you've gone?  No.  Good man. 
[02:45:00]  The gun pro-rights people  came to my house  and they photographed  that sign  and they said  I had private armed security.  It was a link  to the Beverly Hills  Police Department.  Well, it was.  I presume nobody here  would disagree with  my right to be protected  by the police.  Well, that is your right.  Or indeed the military.  And when it comes to the military,  my brother is a British Army colonel.  My uncle was a British Army major.  My grandfather was a commander.  I'm not a pacifist.  I understand the power of guns.  I personally believe  that military weapons 
[02:45:30]  belong in the hands  of the military or the police.  Well, yeah,  but that's what's happening  here in this country.  A semi-automatic weapon  is not a military weapon.  It's an assault weapon.  You want the right  to have a machine gun?  An AR-15.  You want the right  to a machine gun?  Sure.  Which means if you have it,  everybody else  should have one too.  No, I would love to be able  to jump through  whatever hoops  it would take  legally  to obtain it.  And I know you can  in some places.  Vegas,  for one,  you could shoot.  What do you think  all the gangbangers  get their guns in Chicago, 
[02:46:00]  where there's actually  reasonably tough gun control?  A lot of them are stolen  and a lot of them are shipped in.  50% of all the guns  that the police recovered  in Chicago  came from neighboring states.  Yeah,  and the second you bring it  over the state line,  it's an illegal gun.  It becomes an illegal gun.  So we're supposed to take it away  from the legal gun owners  because criminals  are taking them  across the lines?  No one's not...  Wait a minute.  Like prohibition.  Let me ask you...  No, you're being so facile.  It wouldn't work.  I am not.  I'm saying that  when they outlawed booze,  booze poured into the country. 
[02:46:30]  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Not a single person,  me,  President Obama,  Michael Bloomberg,  Senator Dianne Feinstein...  Naming all the good ones.  Not a single of the gun grabbers  has ever actually asked  for a single gun  to be taken away.  Because they knew  it wouldn't work.  They've tried.  They would love it.  Wait a minute.  They would love to.  My point is  you can't keep saying  they're gun grabbing.  They're not taking anybody's gun,  right?  We are talking about  the type of firearms  that should be readily available  going through.  You can't.  They took them.  How many guns,  if you took in 
[02:47:00]  every single one  of President Obama's  assault weapons  ban proposals,  how many types of firearm  in America  would still be legally available?  Probably quite a few.  How many?  I don't know.  You're an American.  I'm British.  Come on.  How many in your country?  Why would I know  if how many guns...  Why would you know more  about gun rules  in your country  than me?  I don't know.  That's not a gun rule.  This is a weird stat  that you know  that I don't know.  I don't think it's weird  to try to make it sound  like I'm not educated.  How many guns  would be left  if you took  all the assault weapons  are...  It's a fucking math problem.  I don't know 
[02:47:30]  the numbers.  Let me ask you  to try and hazard a guess  at how many different  types of gun,  firearm,  would be legally available  in America.  50 billion gazillion,  Piers.  Be serious.  I know the answer  but I'm not going to blow it.  Shut up.  Do you know?  I have no idea.  Have a guess.  Two.  No, a lot.  How many?  Have a guess.  5,000.  If you took all the...  What's the question?  If you stripped out  every single assault weapon  that President Obama  under the plan  that was put forward  wanted to remove  from civilian circulation  going forward.  Not confiscation  but from sale.  He's trying to get you 
[02:48:00]  to say something  and then it's going to be  this huge number  that so many guns  are still going to be available  even if you take  the assault weapon.  Well, so what?  Well, what is the percentage?  So what?  Have a guess.  How many are available now?  About 2,400 I think.  Okay, so I'm going to guess  I would say 2,200.  It's about that, yeah.  I want to...  Yeah, you're basically talking  two or three hundred  types of gun  will be removed  from future purchase  and these would be  assault weapons.  Why can't I purchase  a semi-automatic weapon  with a 10 round magazine? 
[02:48:30]  You've already said that.  I want one.  I can't have one.  I want a rocket ship too.  I can't have one.  Because there are  reasonable restrictions.  Yeah.  And there are reasonable.  Have you fired an AR-15?  Taking...  Sure.  Yeah.  I own four of them.  What is the difference  really?  You don't want to know  how many guns  he actually owns.  I don't mind if you have guns.  He has a lot of guns.  He drinks heavily as well.  And he kicks kittens.  Yeah.  No, I love my kitten.  Bad person.  I love my kitten.  Can I ask Pierce something? 
[02:49:00]  Sure.  As quote an outsider,  what do you think  America's obsession  is with guns?  I think it's very cultural.  I mean, you look at  someone like Canada  which has a very high  volume of guns  but has nothing like  your gun crime rate.  There's something about  the culture of gun violence  in America.  But what is it?  I think it's a combination.  of things.  I think it's the cultural  battles with my own homeland  in the 18th century  where you had to fight off  enemy territory with guns  and that was successfully achieved.  I then think you had  your own civil war 
[02:49:30]  which obviously  had a huge amount  of gun violence  and I think as a result  of that  guns became part  of a family home  in many cases  and people believe  that their Second Amendment  rights  give them the right  to continue  to basically arm themselves  to the teeth  if they want to.  Now, my argument is  that at some point  there's got to be  a better application  of reasonable restrictions.  I repeat,  I'm not going to take  anybody's gun away.  It's not about confiscation. 
[02:50:00]  Nor do I think  when you have 300 million  guns in circulation  you can't expect  a family that wants  a firearm,  a handgun  to defend their family  from having one.  I respect that.  That is what I think  would be what  the founding fathers  intended  when they wrote  originally about this.  But let's face facts.  The Second Amendment  is already an amendment,  right?  The original Constitution  wasn't perfect.  That's why there were  so many amendments.  To me,  it is so vague  the wording  of the Second Amendment  and can be so  interpreted in different ways. 
[02:50:30]  Only if you want  to twist it around.  Either way.  Either way.  You can either believe  as I believe...  It was written simply.  As I see it...  If it was so simple,  why was the interpretation  until the mid-80s  of this recent century,  why for 170-odd years  was it interpreted  to mean an individual's  right to bear arms  as part of a  well-regulated militia?  Because people weren't  trying to take guns 
[02:51:00]  from people  up until pretty recently.  What is a well-regulated  militia, though?  What is it?  A well-regulated militia  is...  Here's what it is,  and especially back  when it was written.  If you have your townspeople,  people in your town,  you want them to be armed  so that if they have to  rally up a militia  to fight some type of...  They were a trained  private local militia, right?  No, they were the townspeople.  They were the butcher,  the baker,  and the candlestick maker.  But they are trained 
[02:51:30]  to use the farms.  They work as a militia.  They work as a militia.  But the militia...  They're not individuals, right?  The militia of that day  was just the people in town  and their weapons  being called together.  Now that it's become  an individual militia  of individuals  living in their homes  with individual firearms,  who's regulating them?  It would be  the militia itself.  Who?  There is no militia  regulating you, right?  No.  You've got nobody  regulating your use of firearms.  No, because we haven't  rallied a militia together yet.  Right. 
[02:52:00]  There's no need for one yet.  But if need ever came...  If you believe  that the founding fathers  intended you to have a gun  as part of a well-regulated militia,  I ask you again,  where is that militia  and where are they regulating you?  There isn't one now.  Right.  The amendment says  that the right to bear arms  shall not be infringed  so that if we need  to put together a militia,  we already have the weaponry.  That's how the amendment  is interpreted.  But that's not how 
[02:52:30]  it was interpreted  for 170 years.  It says  a well-regulated militia  being necessary  for a free state.  This is where you're wrong.  The right to bear arms  shall not be infringed.  Right.  It means...  But there is a comma  in the middle of a sentence  which means you can take it  either way.  And the Supreme Court  in 2008 or 2009  decided that it actually  didn't mean,  what did it be interpreted  to mean for 170 years,  it actually meant  an individual's right  to bear arms  no longer as part of  they won't...  Well, whatever it is.  ...regulated militia.  But it's not whatever it is.  It's a hugely important point. 
[02:53:00]  If you believe, as I do,  that the NRA hijacked  the meaning of the  Second Amendment  to sell guns,  then you've got to debate  whether the interpretation  of the Supreme Court  affirmed in the late 2000s  is correct.  Why would you think  the Founding Fathers,  knowing that there is an army,  there's a standing U.S. army,  why would they say,  well, you have to be  in a militia  in order to have weapons?  Because America, as you know,  is a very big country.  Yeah.  So the idea of the standing army  being able to get  to some of the outplaces  of America within weeks 
[02:53:30]  would have been unthinkable.  You don't think  the Founding Fathers...  Now, we can drop a bomb  or a drone  anywhere in America  in a matter of minutes, right?  Yeah.  So the need to have  a local militia  to take on the British  if we reinvade  has gone.  You also have,  let me remind you,  5,000 nuclear warheads  as a military firepower.  America has half the world's  military firepower  at its disposal.  Right.  You don't have to worry  about the British coming.  You haven't got to worry  about anybody coming.  And you've got to worry  even less about tyranny  from your own government. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, really?  Because let me explain to you.  If they do come for you,  your government,  they've got 5,000 nukes.  They're going to win.  We understand.  A few AR-15s  is not going to succeed.  It's not about winning...  So the tenets  of the argument  are ridiculous.  No, it's not.  Because it's not  about winning or losing.  It's about a government  having to kill  its own people  because they're on  where they are 15s  instead of having nothing.  You're missing my point.  No, you're missing my point.  Having no weaponry  and just doing it  with a swipe of a pen.  If they decided to do that,  how are you going  to defend themselves?  I guess nukes.  You don't. 
[02:54:30]  If the United States  has to start nuking  its own people,  I think it's over, Peter.  I think the country's done.  I'm assuming...  If that gets to that point.  Well, I would say  it's fairly done  if they turn tyrannical.  So it's a question  of how they execute  the tyranny.  But if they have to take  a single American life  based on the fact  that they want  a tyrannical leadership  over Americans,  then they have to fight  people with AR-15s  as opposed to just  writing something  with a pen  and not having  any resistance whatsoever.  They would use  all the firepower I had. 
[02:55:00]  Which is nuclear weapons.  Like I said,  and then the government's over.  It's done.  Peter has to go.  We're not trying to interrupt.  Oh, my God.  Your people are freaking out.  For CNN,  they're saying  you have to go.  I've got that.  But let me decide.  I think this is a good debate.  I wish this debate  happened more often.  I think it's a good  important debate.  I'm not trying to  patronize people.  I'm not trying to tell you  how to lead your lives.  I just want,  in the end,  to see less,  fewer Americans  get hit by gunfire  and die from gunfire.  I suspect we all  agree with that.  What we're debating  is how you best 
[02:55:30]  achieve it.  Exactly.  Pierce's book is called  Shooting Straight.  We didn't plug this properly.  Guns, Gays, God,  and George Clooney.  We didn't even get  to talk about the gays.  I know.  I would love to  or at least demonstrate.  And Pierce looks  very fucking handsome  on the cover.  I enjoyed this very much.  I really liked this a lot.  I agree with a lot  of what you said.  Bravo to both participants.  Bravo.  That was a good debate.  And you get a lot  of Twitter haters, man.  I love trolls.  You love them?  Well, especially  when they are bad spellers.  I like to correct them. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  You know,  they say you're a moron  and they spell it wrong  and it's like,  great.  Oh, the York thing  is very rampant.  Or they forget to put  that hyphen between  more and on.  Exactly.  You stay at CNN?  Yeah.  Refer the rumors.  Yeah, I'm contracted  to CNN until next September,  which will take me  up to four years.  And I'm going to start  talking to them  in the next few months  about the future.  I love CNN.  To me, it's one of the  great news brands  of the world.  I, as you read the book,  it's in diary format.  I've been at the center  of some of the biggest  news stories in history,  whether it's, you know,  the mass shootings  that you've had, 
[02:56:30]  the death of Osama Bin Laden,  the Japanese earthquake,  the Arab Spring uprisings.  It's a thrilling place  to be when big news breaks.  And I've also had  the great honor  of interviewing some  of the most important  people in the world,  whether it's, you know,  the Iranian president,  Ahmadinejad,  or Prime Minister Netanyahu,  or the Dalai Lama,  whoever it may be,  Bill Clinton.  You feel like at CNN  you're at the center  of all the big stuff.  And that's where  I've always liked to be.  All right, Piers.  All right, Piers.  Come back and see us.  Anytime, guys.  I'm actually going to read this.  I've enjoyed it.  Important debate.  Well, what happened?  You don't want him back?  No. 
[02:57:00]  Invite him back?  Thanks, Piers.  Guys, I appreciate the time.  All right, right on.  Thank you very much.  Piers Morgan, everyone.  The O.P. and Anthony Show  on Sirius XM.  See, told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Piers Morgan  for coming in today.  That was a great debate. 
[02:57:30]  That was a good debate,  huh, Jimmy?  I said great, actually.  It was a great debate.  I liked Piers a lot.  I thought, like,  I enjoyed...  He's controversial.  I like that.  It kind of went into the...  You know, I wanted to talk  to him more about  the other stuff,  but that gun thing  was so interesting.  It was like...  There's so many things  you could bring up with him.  Yeah.  Because he's been in the middle  of the shit for a while now.  I don't find him to be  unreasonable with certain things.  Like, he's less unreasonable  than I thought he would be.  Like, as far as not wanting 
[02:58:00]  people's guns removed  from their homes  and all that,  but he does, though.  Just like...  No one ever says  they want to take  your guns away.  No one.  And there are people  that you know  want to take guns  out of people's houses,  but they can't.  So they say,  we don't want to take  your guns away.  Then, meanwhile,  they figure out  a backdoor way  to do it.  Like, in New York,  like I said,  try to go into a gun store  in the state of New York  and buy one of these  horrid AR-15s. 
[02:58:30]  You can't do it.  Now, in essence,  they've taken away  your guns.  They've taken away  your option  to choose a weapon  that is available  in other places  in this country  to defend yourself  like you would want to.  Like the police  come to a crime scene  and protect  the people around them  and protect themselves  with this type of weapon.  I want the ability  to have that same right  to protect myself.  You cannot do that  now in New York.  They have, in essence,  taken away that gun 
[02:59:00]  from the people.  Man, he got to you.  Oh, fuck.  He got to me.  By the way,  I think we're all missing.  Listen how excited  you still are.  I know.  I get wound up.  We're all missing  the very good point I made.  It was a terrific point, Jimmy.  About why don't you question  the motives of a rapist  or a child molester  the same way.  Dare I say it was brilliant.  They don't.  When it's a gun murder,  they want to pin  the blame on the gun  more so than  whatever the person did, 
[02:59:30]  who they were.  When it's any other crime,  you pin the blame  on the person.  It's an astounding  turn of events.  Even though,  to be honest,  I loathe the NRA.  I love you,  but I loathe the NRA.  I am the NRA.  I hate,  but Wayne LaPierre,  I think,  is a pig,  and I really do have  a visceral hatred for them.  Yeah.  So I agree with him  on a lot of the stuff  he was saying.  I just happen to like you  much more.  Aw.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You guys should hug it out.  Hug it out. 
[03:00:00]  More importantly,  Iraq has not left his money.  What happened?  He refuses to leave  his money later on.  Guns kill people.  I think they're very bad.  I think they just  give him up.  Sal was in there  getting so pissed off  running the board.  Why?  Because he thought  that Iraq was taking  care of personal matters,  but Iraq was just  sitting out in the hallway  for the whole  Piers Morgan segment  next to his money.  He should open it up  and jump into like  Scrooge McDuck.  There's cameras all over,  too.  No one's going to  take your money,  Iraq.  You know how long  it would take  to steal 255 pounds 
[03:00:30]  of quarters?  Karen,  no one's going to  take the money here.  A lot of people say  that I shortchanged Iraq.  That he,  Iraq's one of them.  Yeah.  Iraq is one of them.  A lot of people say  that I shortchanged  Iraq saying that  he weighs more  than 250 pounds.  I'm over it now.  All that guilt,  all that shit is done.  Yeah,  you paid it off  in quarters.  I know.  Very nice.  That's it.  And you're going  to get a W-2. 
[03:01:00]  It's taxable to you.  Holy shit.  Take one of those boxes  and there was,  if I did a corporate  check there,  you would have been taxed.  Right.  There was,  honest to God,  some questioning going on  out in the hallway  about whether or not  there would be some kind  of check after the show  as in,  like,  oh,  that was just for the air.  Here's a little.  No.  No,  that's it.  No.  It's like,  the guy sitting in front  of $5,000 cash  is asking if there's  going to be a check.  That's tax-free money. 
[03:01:30]  That's like getting  about $8,000 in a check.  E-Rock is not happy  with the,  uh,  No,  he is not.  He's not,  right,  Sam?  Absolutely not.  And that's honest.  You want to grab him?  What are you going to do?  He's,  uh,  He's annoyed.  That's great.  I got a Sudoku to finish.  Bring in your money.  Bring the money in.  Bring in the 250 pounds  of quarters.  Filthy money.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's got a thing.  And it is.  Kenny did tell me  the accurate number.  Yeah.  It's 255.  It's 255 pounds.  255 pounds of quarters 
[03:02:00]  being reeled back  into the studio.  Can you make a pyramid  on the console  so we get a nice shot  of this?  No one has got  a good picture  of this thing.  That's too bad.  Just put the fucking  quarters up there.  Do a pyramid.  Just do it.  For the show.  Eric!  Is Kenny going to  allow you to have  the hand truck?  I'm borrowing it  for the day.  Oh, Kenny,  you pussy.  Put them back on.  We all want  photo-ups.  Good photo-up. 
[03:02:30]  You're right.  You're going to do it?  At any point,  did you think  it was getting  a little too heated  with Piers Morgan?  No, no, no.  Not at all.  No, why?  No, it was very civil.  No, there's a reason  why I'm bringing this up.  Yeah.  I do have follow-ups.  Uh-huh.  Because  what happens  in those situations,  and it happened  to our good friend  Jesse Ventura there.  Yeah.  Like, when someone  is in over their head,  that's when they get  all weird and fucking  either march out 
[03:03:00]  or threaten you  with physical violence.  He knew he had  his facts  that he could  hang in there.  It's a different head show.  Because I saw him  getting mad.  And I saw you  getting heated,  but you both  had enough knowledge.  Wherewithal.  Right, right.  To your point,  that it kept  the debate moving along  instead of getting  to that tough guy  territory that happened  with Ventura.  It's weird, too.  It's not his show.  Like, Piers,  on his show,  he does get a lot more  in the people's face. 
[03:03:30]  He calls people names  a lot more.  He won't let people  talk, really.  I think he doesn't talk.  In this situation,  he had...  You don't think?  A lot of times,  he cuts...  He was cutting me off a lot.  Yeah, that was the only thing  I didn't like.  A lot of times,  he interrupted it.  I almost said,  like, don't let...  Because a couple times,  there's a debate tactic.  Like, if I ask you a question  and you're answering it  and you're taking a second,  if I jump in with a follow-up question...  As opposed to allowing you  to give a lucid answer  to the first question.  Right, right.  Yeah, I didn't really get  to finish my whole  Second Amendment, 
[03:04:00]  you know,  militia versus individual  versus militia argument.  Yeah.  I mean, the way it's...  The way that amendment's worded,  I mean, Jesus.  Yeah.  It's so easy to figure out.  Well, I don't know.  I also wonder,  allow,  when you said  that's how they intended it,  even if that is  how they intended it,  fuck them.  Like, I don't know.  Well, then fuck them  on freedom of speech.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you why I say that.  Because if you say  they saw it coming  and they worded that anyway, 
[03:04:30]  then they were dumb.  Like, almost like,  I don't want to pay the price  because they didn't understand  how bad things were going to get.  Well, they knew...  No, no.  They knew and commented  on the fact that  you can't trade freedoms  for safety in this country.  You just...  It's a very silly thing to do.  And I wouldn't want to.  I agree with you.  It's a...  So, why would you then  put these safety measures  in place  on an amendment  where it says  shall not be infringed?  Like, it means  shall not be infringed. 
[03:05:00]  Not shall not be infringed  except for  this or that.  Can I ask you this?  This has always bothered me  about it  because the argument was,  well, that was the...  Like, when you talk about slavery  or you, anybody,  we say,  well, that was just the time  in America.  The smile.  But the argument,  like, when you say,  like, the same time  these amendments  were written and drafted  or the Constitution,  they owned slaves.  Right.  And the argument is,  well, that was just the time.  So how come  that argument 
[03:05:30]  doesn't apply  for when this was written?  Well, that was just the time.  Like, why is  the barbarism  or the piggishness  of slavery  allowed to be written off  to the time?  Right.  But a possible error  in thinking with this  is not allowed to be written off  the time.  Well, because one of those  is taking away  a person's right  and the other  is giving them,  not even giving them  the right,  acknowledging  what is supposedly  your God-given right.  The amendments,  your rights 
[03:06:00]  in the Constitution  are not the government  giving you these rights.  They are just the rights  you have as a human being.  So when you have slavery,  of course,  it shouldn't have been  allowed because  it's taking away  people's rights  to freedom.  So that's why  that could be changed.  But the right  to bear arms  and defend yourself  is one of your  inherent rights.  But just the hypocrisy,  the embarrassing hypocrisy 
[03:06:30]  of that.  It's embarrassing.  There's embarrassing  hypocrisies  that we're living with today.  Sure.  And we don't take them seriously.  I don't take,  I don't take the,  I don't respect the people.  And I mean,  I respect the founding fathers.  But you can't throw out  everything just because  there's some glaring  hypocrisies in this country.  I agree.  But the people  who hold on to  verbatim,  the wording at that time,  they don't say,  well,  that was the time.  But when you mention slavery,  like these were slave owners,  so how seriously  they write it,  it's just a selective... 
[03:07:00]  You can't throw out  the baby with the bathwater,  Jimmy.  I, you know...  Oh, God.  I don't like to  throw out anything.  I hate Craig.  I try to save everything.  Oh, good, good, Craig.  I save newspapers.  I save magazines.  Do that, Craig.  I save wrapping paper.  Oh, Craig is the worst character.  It's still a fun debate.  Yeah, it was.  I liked it.  I'd wanted to talk to him  about the gun issue  for a while.  Yeah, the Trayvon thing, 
[03:07:30]  I kind of wanted to get  into that a little  and how the news handled that  and how they didn't acknowledge  the fact that Zimmerman  was assaulted  after the verdict came in.  All they talked about  was the unarmed teen  that was murdered  and it's like,  oh, that's right,  he was punching  this man in the face  and the news  completely dropped  that part of the argument.  The editing of the  various audio,  things like that.  There's so much behavior  the press that I want  to talk about.  The press is deplorable  and of course that's his,  you know,  you don't shit where you eat.  Sure.  So I don't think  he's going to really  get into that  and acknowledge  how poorly the press, 
[03:08:00]  look, you know how I want,  and I wanted to mention this  but he fucking kept going off,  do you know how I want  mass shootings  covered on the news  like they used to  cover it on the news  when they only had  a half hour  for the whole newscast  and you couldn't dedicate  entire hour block programs  to building these people  into anti-heroes.  Or villains actually, right?  It was a news program,  they gave you the facts,  they gave you, you know,  that and that was it. 
[03:08:30]  We didn't have to dig  into every aspect  of this guy's life.  Yeah, and the thing  about trying to figure out  why he did it...  Well, leave that  to the police.  But it's also an excuse  because, you know,  if the guy just jumped  up and down  and went like...  and threw rocks at people,  you wouldn't question  why he did it.  You'd go,  look at that crazy fuck.  Right.  Well, it's the same thing  with these guys.  And when he said,  should we not name him?  My initial thing  was to go, no,  because it's not important  because they're not  looking for him  because he's caught.  Unless you're hunting.  But I get why the press 
[03:09:00]  would name a criminal.  I understand why  they would name him.  But the first day  or whatever.  But, you know,  they just perpetuate  and they push it forward  because for them,  it's their business.  It's hours and hours.  It's all about ratings.  We all know that.  Then when the news...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  This is collapsing here.  We've got to take this off.  Then when the news portion...  Oh, boy.  When the news portion is done,  they go with these  fucking hour-long programs.  You get Greta gets on  and then, you know,  this one and that one. 
[03:09:30]  And they cover the same stories  over and over.  The guy's face,  the killer's face  is up on the screen  longer than would ever have been  before the 24-hour news cycles.  And that motivates people.  And the FBI has proven that it does  because they're going out...  That's been proven.  ...in a blaze of glory.  They want to go out  making a statement.  They want to go out being heard.  So when you print...  The only person I agree with them  printing the manifesto of,  and this is what started it,  was the Unabomber.  It was because it helped them 
[03:10:00]  catch him.  Yeah.  They didn't do that afterwards  to glorify him.  They did that because  they had these writings  and they thought somebody  might recognize the writings.  That helped them catch him.  So that's the only reason  they caught him  because they saw him  on his one-wheeled bicycle.  The Unabomber.  That was a good one.  No, it wasn't.  I know it wasn't.  That was terrible.  It was good for me.  I mean, just to hear it.  Of course.  Yeah, that manifesto.  But I mean, that made sense  because that did help them  catch him. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  But as far as getting  in the mind of a killer,  not interested,  he's a crazy fuck,  that's it.  And let law enforcement  learn why he did it  and paw through  his manifestos and stuff  so that they have  a better idea  for maybe next time.  It doesn't need to be  splattered all over  the fucking news.  If you want to search it out,  I think it should be  available to you.  But getting in the mind  of the killer  is good for their business.  Right.  But that's what he doesn't  want to acknowledge that. 
[03:11:00]  He wants to make it  seem like it's all  just a news program.  Public service or something.  Don't try to bullshit me.  No, it's great for ratings.  It's great for the advertisers.  We're all stupid enough  to watch it.  You know, as much as  I yell and scream about it,  of course I'm watching it.  But that's good  for their fucking business  and absolutely,  it's a separation  from true news.  When he said,  because people might be  watching it and saying,  hey, I know that guy.  I want to go,  are you saying that  with a straight face?  But, you know,  again, I know he's... 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, the press thing  I would love to have  talked about more  than made love.  My show is today,  by the way,  if anybody care.  I'm not saying  you guys leave.  Wow, we gotta leave.  No, we better leave.  No, no, no,  I don't mean it for that reason.  Fuck out of here.  You're out of here.  It's your show.  Holy shit.  I'm going to promote you  because the phones  don't ring for the first  five minutes  if I don't promote it.  Jimmy,  I want my wife  to fuck a black guy  while I watch,  but she won't do it.  Oh my God.  Exactly.  I love those calls.  Exactly.  You make them.  I like Jimmy's advice show. 
[03:12:00]  It's fun.  By the way,  nobody touch my fucking  tennis balls.  I use them to rub my back on.  What'd you call?  Well, you initialed them,  so that should keep  the people away.  No one touch my balls.  He uses it to rub his face on.  See, because I'd have  my balls on your face.  Yes, I would enjoy it.  I guess that's the implication.  T-D-D-D-D-D-D.  I can't read  I can't read  the noises.  Sorry.  Snuffleupagus.  I can't read E-Rock.  What's the deal? 
[03:12:30]  He's happy, right?  No, he's legit mad.  E-Rock, comment?  He's legit mad?  Yeah, he was mad  outside during the  Piers Morgan interview.  Oh, boy.  He's annoyed.  He's texting his wife.  Oh, jeez.  Do you know  what this motherfucker did?  This cue motherfucker?  I bet he wrote  Do you know  what this motherfucker did?  No, I did not do that.  But you're right.  You're happy?  Son of a bitch?  He probably wrote  You were right, honey.  He said  He said that he thought  you would skim a little off.  He didn't think  you would skim this much off. 
[03:13:00]  So he's a little more  upset with the amount  than the delivery.  He's very upset  about the amount.  How much do you think  would have been appropriate?  Well, you should have  gained more weight.  Would you have gone  Would you have been  good with seven grand?  Yeah.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  He thinks seven.  He said, number one,  that's not what he said  he would do.  And number two,  what the fuck am I supposed  to do with all these quarters?  I don't know.  Go to a bank.  Video arcade.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  So wait.  Kenny and me are just  telling me to go to a coin store.  You could get a kill screen.  Yep.  That many fucking quarters. 
[03:13:30]  Hell yeah.  You should just buy the machine.  Well, you could do that too.  Why is he smiling so much  if he's not happy?  Because he gets all like  He likes the attention?  He does like the attention.  And now he's going to be  the talker around the hallways  today after we leave?  Scuttlebutt.  But he's also in a weird spot  because up until this moment  he was in this spot  where he had like an authority  at least on a moral ground  over everybody  because he had been wronged.  Right.  Right.  And he kind of had  everybody over a barrel.  And now  It's over.  It's kind of unraveling  and he realizes  he's not going to go to the company now 
[03:14:00]  and be like,  well, I need a promotion  or  he's not going to go to you  and be like,  well, I need more money.  He realizes  $5,000 in quarters  is what's  That's the end of it.  That's the end of it.  It's the end of the road.  You're in a cul-de-sac.  And like he  It's over, Johnny.  But I better get out of it  or something.  Fuck yeah,  or a scrotum.  Go ahead, Iraq.  I thought it was very thoughtful.  Thoughtful.  I have to crunch in the numbers.  Yeah, I have to crunch in all of it.  Anyone can just write a check.  That's silly.  Yeah, you gave  And you knew his weight. 
[03:14:30]  I did.  Well, that was incorrect too.  So you're saying  he owes you a little more?  So you owe me some money then.  I'm torn on how to answer that.  Right.  How much was I off by?  A box?  Give me a box.  That doesn't matter  how much you were off.  Give me a box.  I'll give it to Travis.  You weren't off by 25 pounds,  I don't think.  Yo, Travis,  if he gives me a box back,  it's yours.  How come Travis gets the box?  Because he's a nice guy.  I'm really nice.  No, you're the devil.  Oh, that is true. 
[03:15:00]  So, Iraq,  what would it take  to make you happy?  I want Iraq to be happy.  It don't matter  what it takes at this point.  No, no, I'm just kidding.  It's over.  I just want to know.  I got a clear conscience.  Frederick Hughes is looking  down on me today  and I get to sleep  better at night.  Jim is counting his bucks  right now.  He's just showing me  what he has.  I'm actually,  I have 80 bucks.  What would,  that's for me.  I'm not exactly  showing this off.  I had more last night,  but you know,  cum had to leave.  I had to get rid  of cumzies.  This is,  I got to say,  Colin Flaherty,  he wrote 
[03:15:30]  White Girl Bleed A Lot,  Return of Racial Violence,  to America.  About black and white.  Yeah,  it's about black  on white crime  and the black,  rise of black violence.  Are they selling  that in bookstores?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, they are.  And online,  of course,  Amazon and whatnot.  I like this.  They have these scans  on various pages  that you scan  with your phone  and videos pop up.  That's genius.  So, yeah,  it's like all these pages.  That's the way to,  that's the future.  So now, 
[03:16:00]  you could read about it  and then you scan this,  wow,  Is that the first book  doing that?  code and you could see  like assault,  a pregnant woman,  we got Marine attacked.  So,  he could write about it  and then he could watch  the various videos.  I did this in my book,  actually.  No, you didn't.  I did.  For certain members  of the TS community.  To go to her  slash question marks website.  That's great.  E-Rock,  the money picture  is doing very well  on my Instagram.  Oh, I'm good. 
[03:16:30]  I'm happy for you.  And very,  it's doing very well.  Oh, nice.  OP Radio on Instagram,  it's getting some fucking views.  E-Rock's okay now.  Kenny and me reminded E-Rock too  that the real pleasure  of the whole thing  is that you skimmed  a little off the top,  you gave your friend,  E-Rock,  what you thought he deserved.  I had to take a little taste.  Take a little taste.  After crunching the numbers,  I had to take a little taste.  But what's nice is,  I have to take a taste.  What's nice is,  I love that.  Because, you know,  this was time taken out of my day.  Tribute,  like in the old country.  And you know how much 
[03:17:00]  we make an hour,  so I had to take a little taste.  You had to take a taste.  I took about 15 minutes.  And you,  I took 15 minutes of time,  can now put the video  of you giving in the quarters  on YouTube.  It's a strong move.  Make a little of that money back.  You know what?  If people fucking sit through  a few fucking commercials,  I could break even on this  with that video.  That's what I'm thinking.  Fucking great.  So,  everybody's a winner here.  Congratulations to E-Rock  on the quarters.  E-Rock's a winner.  Congratulations.  For once in his life,  he's a winner.  Do you feel like a winner, E-Rock?  He's not smart enough 
[03:17:30]  to understand what happened today.  But he will eventually.  I think he will eventually.  Opie was probably just responsible  for what, like,  a game show winner would get.  Yes, that's exactly what it is.  I won a game show prize.  You get the flight,  and you get the hotel,  and they're not going to pay  for everything.  Yeah.  So, you know.  He got a little more  than the flight in the hotel.  I think you're right here.  You know that, Ant.  So, he should thank you.  Yes.  I think I paid for his  Simpsons day as well.  Oh, God.  Which was so annoying  to hear about,  but I had to sit here  and just bite my lip. 
[03:18:00]  It didn't look like many people  were at the Simpsons thing  when you were there.  Yeah.  Not many people  at any of the parts.  More people were  at the O.J. Simpsons team.  Me and Jimmy  talked about that on the way home,  how awful that sounded.  We're just not in that world.  No, not in that world.  I couldn't imagine  sitting there and having a fucking...  No.  Having a beer at Moe's?  Yeah, no.  Having a flaming Moe?  God, no.  Why?  No.  Flaming Moe.  Who cares?  I think it'd be cool.  Getting on the phone  and listening to the pranks and stuff?  No.  No? 
[03:18:30]  You're dead inside.  You're dead inside.  You've got to update your references.  I'm a happy man these days.  Everyone knows that they see it.  He's smiling, for the record.  The opener is smiling.  It's a psychotic smile,  but it is a smile.  My mic.  My mic.  Hey, my mic.  So do you have anything to say  to the Opster before we go  in reference to the $5,000?  I'm thinking...  Opie and Anthony  have left the building.  Left the building. 
[03:19:00]  But Jim Norton  is not going anywhere.  If you have problems at home,  it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show is next.

You're not going to leave.  Why?  Fire drill.  What does that mean? 
[03:21:00]  You're stuck here.  For how long?  Probably 10 minutes.  Until they clear the building.  Yeah, because the elevator shut down.  What are you talking about?  Fire drill.  Stairs!  You can go 36 floors?  Easy.  You cray-cray.  I could do 36 floors  in 2 minutes.  Tops.  Want to time me?  Yeah.  Get a camera  because I go fast.  Who's going to keep up?  Let's do this.  I just do the trust system.  What do you think of  E-Rock  and the quarters there, Roland?  He's very upset.  I would at least  give him 8 grand.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:21:30]  We're suffering.  Dopes don't play that way.  Ben.  What are you doing  with that check there?  That was a prop.  I figured.  That was a prop  to throw you off.  He thought something was coming.  Oh, you think  there's more coming?  Get the fuck out of here.  This was my prop  to go,  hey, see,  I'm a good guy.  Here's your check  and then,  oh, wait a minute.  You're not doing anything  with it right now.  Are you going to make him  pay for, like, a dinner  to apologize?  He'll be...  Travis, you want 200 bucks?  Yeah, I'll take 200 bucks.  I just want to avoid  the fire drill.  All right.  E-Rock said 
[03:22:00]  I'm not doing anything  with this check,  so I'll give you 200 bucks.  Shit, I'll take it.  You can buy this  on the Pro Jam t-shirt.  I don't know  how to spell your last name.  T-E-F-F-T  or T-Cash.  Yeah, or cash.  T-E-what?  E-F-F-T  Okay.  Two Fs.  E-Rock,  you just wrote  Travis Taft on that check.  You're not getting anything.  I see that,  but neither are you.  Like, that's...  Why would I get something?  He didn't get my phone number  right on the air.  You got me for lunch today?  Yeah, I got you for lunch, buddy. 
[03:22:30]  Of course I do.  This is...  E-Rock said I wasn't doing  anything with his check,  so here's just a little taste.  He really gave Travis...  It's got his name on it, Eric.  It's not for anyone.  A little taste.  That's your...  That's your Pearl Jam money.  Hey, look at that!  A little taste.  I didn't say it was a big taste.  I said a little taste.  Are you excited?  About Pearl Jam?  Yeah.  I can't fucking wait.  It's going to be great.  How do I get the new album?  It's on my desk.  Do you have an extra copy? 
[03:23:00]  I do.  Do you want it?  Or the $3,000 you saved on Eric.  He could buy it.  What happened?  The $3,000 you saved on Eric.  He could buy it.  Dude, he's so bad.  I don't care.  It's over.  It's over now.  No joke.  There's a $200 check in my pocket.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's the talk of the whole building.  It becomes a thing.  No, I didn't.  Hey, you hear what happened with Eric today?  He loves it.  He does.  Negative attention, positive attention.  I played into his very soft heart.  Soft outer shell.  I played right into it, yes.  Oh, you know. 
[03:23:30]  He's a softie when it comes down to it.  I played right into that today.  You forgot to sign the check, Opie.  What?  You forgot to sign the check.  I really can't leave?  No, you can't leave.  You forgot to sign the check.  Dude, I can't leave because of this stupid fire drill.  Is it over?  They'll make you sit there.  Am I on the air?  No.  Yeah, we're on the air.  I had to do a live read, and then they told me I can't leave because of a fire drill.  Oh.  You can do what you want.  Huh?  You can leave.  No, the elevators don't work.  Oh.  Where are they now?  Where are the people?  They don't stand in the hallway. 
[03:24:00]  Holy shit.  All right.  You can start?  Oh, let's go.  Call.  What the fuck are you guys doing?  Just fucking around so you got back.  No, not you.  What the fuck?  I mean the people.  Well, have them call.  Give out the number, and they'll be calling in seconds.  What's the number?  6-9-6-9-1969.  All right.  Call.  Jim Jordan's advice show has officially begun.  And maybe the Oapsters might get on the show.  Maybe E-Rock and Sam will all pretend they're doing something and try.  I've never had such a nice crowd for the advice show.  We all need help, Jim.  Absolutely.  Everyone here needs a little bit of fucking assistance. 
[03:24:30]  Ant snuck out just in time.  Fuck.  Eric needs help.  He needs to know what to do when Opie just gave me $200 instead of Eric.  Eric got cocky.  You saw that I had a blank check, and I said it was a prop to throw him off a little bit.  Like, here, here's your fucking money.  And then I'm like, oh, wait a minute.  And then the big reveal, which we did, blah, blah, blah.  So I just gave Travis a little taste.  I say what Eric, my advice to Eric would be to accept the fact that we're going to have fun with this. 
[03:25:00]  And that Opie really was, even though you wanted more, he gave you $5,000 for a silly mistake.  That honestly was a mistake.  That's the problem.  Have you felt how heavy this is?  Of course I did.  I carried them.  Why can't I pull in this?  I got my workout.  No, try pulling the whole cart.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  You feel how heavy this is, try pulling it.  I've heard that before.  All right.  Oh, God.  Kevin in New Jersey.  I think I'm a sex addict.  I need Jim to tell me what to do.  Bye, Jim.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Hi, Kev. 
[03:25:30]  How are you?  Oh, hold on.  E-Rock's futzing around over those quarters.  There we go.  All right.  Hello, Kev.  Kevin.  How you doing, Jimmy?  Good, buddy.  How are you?  Good.  Been wanting to talk to you for a long time.  We share a lot of similar interests, from trannies to everything.  Been trying to get my wife to turn me into a cuckold.  I got her to go as far as blowing a black guy, but she doesn't want to go all out.  I know I'm a sex addict, and I know you've talked about it.  What kind of things can you do?  Is there, like, a 12-step program for that? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, there's a bunch of them.  As far as your wife doing anything, don't try to get her to do anything she doesn't want to do.  The cuckold thing is hot to talk about and to watch in porn.  And, look, some people make it work in their lives, but you don't want to ever have...  You don't want to ever want to do something out of addiction and force her to do something out of addiction.  Because it's almost like making somebody do something because you need to drink.  Like, you don't want to go that far and do that.  The meetings, there are meetings. 
[03:26:30]  There's SLA, SA.  There's a bunch of 12-step meetings that deal with sexual addiction.  So you can pick any one of those and go to it, figure out which one works for you.  That's what my suggestion would be, to go to a 12-step meeting, okay?  Have you done stuff like that before?  I've gone to certain 12-step meetings.  The only reason I don't mention program names on this show is because these programs typically request anonymity at the level of press, radio, and film.  So I respect their request for anonymity.  Yeah, I can appreciate that. 
[03:27:00]  It's just hard for me to understand how that sex addict thing can work because, you know, you don't want to give it up.  Sure, of course not.  It feels good.  Yeah.  But the price to pay for it is not worth it.  What it does to relationships, as they say, a path of human wreckage that we leave behind us.  The way we see other people as mere objects in a fantasy or actors in our play.  And we don't see them as fucking people with needs and feelings.  They're all just means for us to get a dopamine drip and cum.  I mean, it really is an ugly way to be. 
[03:27:30]  It is.  And it's just amazing how similar you and I are in our interests and everything you talk about.  So, you know, I listen to you all the time, especially on Wednesdays, just because of everything and how similar we are.  So I appreciate the help.  Well, thank you, buddy.  And good luck to you, man.  Try one of those 12-step meetings.  Go online, Google it.  You'll absolutely find a 12-step meeting that you can go to.  And I would suggest going.  Just being open-minded.  You may or may not stay, but go.  Okay?  I really appreciate it, man.  And I saw you in Montclair at the Wellmont. 
[03:28:00]  You were great.  Thank you, buddy.  I appreciate it.  Have a good night.  Let's see.  Rick in Boston cheating on his wife with Asian massage parlors and feels guilty, of course.  Hi, Rick.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, man.  I don't even know if I don't go to the full-service massage parlor.  Right.  I just go to, like, the rub and tug, basically.  And I've been getting more and more addicted to them.  Like, it started out, like, once a month or only when I traveled.  And now it's turning into, like, once a week. 
[03:28:30]  Sure.  And now it's turning into, like, maybe twice a week.  And my wife doesn't give it up at all.  We might have sex, like, once or twice every six months.  And I'm 35.  And this is the only way I can really get off.  Right.  You know?  And I just want to make sure that, you know, I mean...  Well, look.  I'll say this.  Any addiction...  Sorry.  Any addiction rolls downhill.  Any addiction starts with one and then goes to two.  That's what...  If it stayed one, it wouldn't be a problem.  You know, if people could drink, if they could drink three beers a week, there would 
[03:29:00]  never be, you know, any type of alcoholism.  It always rolls downhill and gets faster and faster and faster and harder and harder to  stop and more and more important and more and more, you know, you're feeling good is  contingent on, you know, acting out somehow.  Now, I don't know why your wife's not having sex with you.  That's something you should examine.  Did either one of you put on weight or...  You know, someone emailed me and said, one question I never ask about this.  Is she on medication?  Sometimes medication will fuck people up and they don't want to have sex. 
[03:29:30]  That's a problem.  Jimmy, basically, she couldn't have kids.  She couldn't have kids?  Okay.  So she fucking gave up completely.  Okay, so she gave up.  Well, maybe you might have tried therapy for that, you know, because obviously that's  depression.  But as far as feeling guilty, cheating on your wife, look, I'm not married, but I would  say this, if you're going to cheat, if you're going to do something sexual and act out,  better you do it in a way that you will not get or give a disease and that you will not 
[03:30:00]  get anybody pregnant.  And an Asian jerk-off place or any massage parlor is a place where you will not get a  disease and you will not knock anybody up.  Just getting jerked off.  So it's the least of all evils, but you can get arrested.  So, all right?  All right.  Okay.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Be good, my friend.  You know, because a lot of times if you ask a girl, like any woman, like what's the best  gift you've ever gotten?  She'll never say, well, my husband got jerked off in a massage parlor.  She's going to say without hesitation, without even thinking about it, she's going to say  her engagement ring. 
[03:30:30]  Like this guy who's married to the girl he's cheating on now.  She'll say, my engagement ring.  Since I can't have a baby, my engagement ring was the best gift I ever got.  So important.  It's not just a ring, not just a sign of affection.  It is everything to her.  Every time she looks down at her finger, every time she washes her hands, every time she picks  up a knife to stab you with, every time someone at the store hands her change because  you're too broke to have a credit card, they're going to look at her hand and comment  and you will get the credit.  Every time she shows her friends, you get the credit.  You get the credit for that ring, so it has to be fucking good. 
[03:31:00]  Steven Singer understands that.  Steven Singer jewelers, they have the perfect system to make sure you get the perfect ring.  Steven understands how important this is and it's completely painless.  So many of our guys, Opie is gone, E-Rock is gone, Sam is gone.  They made this trip to Steven Singer.

Of 8th and Walnut in Philly.  If you're one of these psychos like the Unabomber who hates technology and hates computers but 
[03:31:30]  you need a ring, go to the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  100% money back guarantee.  You get the best service, the best value, and the best experience.  Steven Singer is the real deal.  He's a guy you can trust and it's the most important gift you're ever going to give.  1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER or IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.COM  Now let's see, Shawna, Tennessee is 28 with a girlfriend, met another gal.  Uh-oh.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  Turn the radio down behind you.  Thank you.  Okay. 
[03:32:00]  I love the show, man, by the way.  I appreciate that.  Man, I've been dating this girl for a little over two years now.  She's a little bit younger than me and she's like really wanting to get serious and stuff  like always wanting, trusting me, like to look at like wedding rings and stuff like that  and I'm just not ready to get locked down all the way and I play music and I was at a music  festival about two weeks ago and I met another girl and we kind of like hit it off really  well, you know, and I'm in a corner.  I don't know really what to do.  I mean, I really want to get to know this other girl, but I just, I don't know what to do. 
[03:32:30]  Well, how long have you been with this girl?  About two and a half years.  And she's already pressuring you for marriage and you don't want to do it before you met  this other girl?  Yes.  Yeah, you know, man, that's what women make a mistake with.  Like a lot of times guys will sit on our asses forever, but after two years, you're not  even 30 and she's nagging you and they wonder why we want to go out and fuck someone younger.  I mean...  She's not even wanting to have sex.  Yeah, that's that, that's...  Well, look, my suggestion would be to do what your gut tells you. 
[03:33:00]  Like, if you want to talk to this other girl, you're not trapped in that relationship.  You're not married to this girl.  So if she's nagging you and annoying you about getting married and you're not fucking and  you meet someone else, well, maybe you break up with this girl and then take a shot with  the new girl.  But I try not to cheat.  As much as I've cheated in the past, I would suggest you don't want to cheat on the girl  because that's kind of an ugly, empty thing to do.  I don't want to lie to her either.  So, you know, I just, I just really don't know what to do right now.  It's just, my boss has tried helping me, telling me what to do. 
[03:33:30]  And I just, I don't, I don't know what to do.  Well, I'll say, you know, there's no one's going to give you the answer.  What you're looking for is the magic answer, which makes it painless and risk-free.  And you're not going to get that.  You're either going to have to risk losing this girl who you're dating and realizing you  fucked up or hurting her feelings and then moving on to a cool new chick.  Either way, there's a risk.  You know, but if this girl's not having sex with you and you just don't want to get married  right now, I don't see any reason why you'd be in the relationship. 
[03:34:00]  Anytime a girl's not fucking you or your husband's not fucking you, that's a bad thing.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I really appreciate it, man.  All right, buddy.  Good luck to you, okay?  Let's see.  Chris in Boston likes to jack off in public toilets while looking at porn on his phone.  Hi, Chris.  How you doing?  Hi, buddy.  What is it you like about that?  I don't know.  It's just like I sit down to go to the bathroom and, you know, I put my phone out and just  go to town. 
[03:34:30]  I don't know.  I mean, clean bathrooms, dirty bathrooms, just bathrooms itself.  Are you having gay sex at all?  Are you craving other guys to catch you?  Nope.  Not at all.  I'm looking at a girl, you know, lesbian porn.  I'm just, I'm not, no.  It's like I said, it can be a clean bathroom.  It can be a filthy bathroom.  Well, how about this?  Do you have no privacy at home?  Well, yeah.  You know, married with, you know, four kids.  So, I do, I don't have privacy at home, but I just don't, don't know why I choose the  public restroom because I can just do it at my house in the bathroom with the door locked. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, okay.  Well, maybe also you don't have the couple of reasons possibly.  The energy of your family is in that house.  The energy of your children.  You know, it might be a little harder to be pornographic with the fucking, over the same  toilet that you're fucking, you know, or look over to the left and you see your kid's teddy  bear toothbrush.  Maybe that's not as exciting to you as just being dirty.  It's almost like going into a public bathroom feels dirty and it feels kind of risky and  it feels non-family energy. 
[03:35:30]  I don't know.  But it's like when I'm about to finish, I like bend it down and like go down into the  toilet and that almost feels, it almost feels better doing it that way than an actual,  you know, like bending it, pushing it down and bending it.  As you like the aiming it into the toilet and coming that way?  Yeah, like bend, you know what I mean?  Like bending, yeah, exactly.  Shooting it into the toilet, bending it down.  Well, I mean, look.  That kind of feels like, I don't know, it's an emotion.  I don't know what it is, but it's just. 
[03:36:00]  Well, it's part of your ritual.  Maybe it's part of your ritual.  Yeah.  Maybe this whole little naughty thing you've discovered, this whole dirty thing that enables  you to not be a family guy for that period of time.  You're not a husband at that period of time.  You're not a dad.  You're just a dirty guy.  You know what I mean?  And you're getting to just jack off at a toilet alone and no one can bother you.  And part of the ritual is feeling that cum in the toilet.  Who knows?  Because you could easily do that at home in the bathroom.  So it's got to be something psychological with getting away from the family. 
[03:36:30]  Thanks, Jim.  That's my guess.  Good luck, man.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  You know, as long as you don't start putting your dick through a hole in the wall.  Let's see.  Melissa in Wisconsin.  Wondering why her husband doesn't want relations.  Hi, Melissa.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  Let me just give you a little bit of background.  I've been married for 15 years.  Okay.  This is not a recent problem.  This has been going on since we were first married.  I thought that once we lived together and were married, he would want to have sex more. 
[03:37:00]  But he didn't.  Why doesn't he?  Have you talked to him?  Well, yeah.  I've talked to him.  It's because his performance is shitty.  Okay.  So we've worked on that, and he was supposed to do some exercises and stuff that he never  did.  Does he lose his erections or come too fast?  Came way too fast.  Okay.  So his performance is shitty, and is he embarrassed about that?  Yeah, he is.  But we went to see someone about it, and he was supposed to do exercises to correct that  years and years and years ago, and he just never did it. 
[03:37:30]  Okay.  Does he masturbate a lot with porn?  I think he does, although, I mean, I haven't, he must hide it, but he has to.  Well, that's not fair of him to not give you sex, and if he comes quickly, but he gets  his erections, right?  Yeah.  Are you, have you put weight on?  No.  Okay.  No.  No.  I don't know why he wouldn't like sex with you.  I don't know.  Maybe he loves you, but just doesn't enjoy the sex. 
[03:38:00]  What's his answer when you ask him?  Well, now, this is the dilemma.  Now, he's sort of, he is more interested in it, but I'm so pissed off now that I don't  want to have sex with him.  See, now you're being spiteful.  Like, okay, this is where you don't want to get into.  If he's coming around after 15 years, then you shouldn't be, if you're that mad at him  that you don't want to fuck him and you're holding a resentment, why are you guys together?  Ah, we've got two kids.  Okay, but fair enough.  But, you know, I would rather, if I was a kid, grow up in a single-parent household  where I see both my parents on weekends or however it works, than with two people who 
[03:38:30]  don't like each other.  Like, why do you want to punish him now?  Why do you want to punish him?  We do get along.  It's, um, because I don't think anything has changed.  Because even if we had sex now, which we do, like, once every six months, it's still shitty.  He never kept up his end of the bargain.  He never did anything to make his premature ejaculation any better.  But he probably knows that you really resent him for coming quickly.  Like, you don't just resent him for not wanting sex. 
[03:39:00]  You resent the actual problem.  Like, so he probably senses and feels that.  Like, when you're disgusted with him and his little fucking quick coming and yuck.  No, I never say anything like that.  No, you don't have to.  We pick up stuff from each other.  It's almost like you can feel when you're being followed.  Or when you get on an elevator with somebody and they want to stab you, you can feel the energy.  He probably feels that resentment or that disgust you have.  But then why wouldn't he do something about it?  Well, that's, again, a good question.  I can't speak for him why he wouldn't.  Maybe, you know, people get caught up in this, uh, uh, you know, they get caught up in this pattern 
[03:39:30]  or they just get afraid or they get lazy.  I don't know why he wouldn't do anything about it, but maybe he resents you for resenting him.  Who knows?  Have you tried couples therapy?  Yeah.  And what was the upshot?  Um, you know, set up a date night, you know, do it, you know, every Saturday night or whatever.  And that's fine, except that it fucking sucks.  Well, maybe, do you suck his cock and then stop before he comes?  Okay, this is the thing. 
[03:40:00]  Um, maybe, maybe I can speak for lots of women whose husbands have problems with premature ejaculation.  You get to the point where it's like, listen, why am I doing all the fucking work here?  Okay, see, that's the, the thing is, you have a lot of resentment towards this guy.  I know, but Jimmy, can't you see why?  I can, but also what you have to realize is, as for men, women's sexual issues are addressed  and okay, and they're open about it.  With us, it brings on a tremendous amount of shame if we can't perform sexually or if 
[03:40:30]  we come too quick or if we like something dirty and fantasy, there's a tremendous amount  of shame about men if we don't feel like we're living up to the performance sexually.  So it's humiliating and enraging when you feel a woman resenting you for it.  So, like, one of the suggestions might be, instead of, hey, work on it, you and your fucking  rotten dick, work on it.  Maybe if you, again, you suck his cock and you stop and you help him edge, yeah, you're  doing more of the work, but don't forget, for him, there's a tremendous amount of shame 
[03:41:00]  involved in it.  Guys who come quick, we don't talk about that, and we're not taught that it's okay to say  that, but there's a lot of shame and embarrassment that's very, very hard for us to navigate.  So you're not just dealing with a guy being a selfish asshole.  Um, you know, there's a lot of stuff that goes into that psychologically that you might  want to bite the bullet, as it were.  Okay.  I would try that.  This way you don't have to end your marriage.  At least try it.  Try helping him suck his dick. 
[03:41:30]  Maybe encourage him to watch a little porn with you and play with his cock while you watch  it and don't let him come.  Or maybe something like that.  Maybe tie him up and do tease and denial like dominatrixes do.  Mm-hmm.  You know, don't let him come.  Mm-hmm.  Um, and see if, because if he's getting the erections, maybe you do that.  Maybe you tease him.  Maybe you just put the tip of his dick inside of you and then pull off it.  Or, or you, you bounce up and down a couple of times and then stop.  You know, maybe you teach him to edge like that, and then when he finally comes, it feels 
[03:42:00]  better, so maybe he'll want to be, have sex like that after.  You understand what I'm saying?  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  But don't be so resentful.  I mean, at least try this way before you fuck the marriage up or he fucks the marriage up.  Oh, I'm not going to, see, that's the thing.  I'm not going to end the marriage.  All right, well then don't just live in it and be resentful.  Well, that's silly.  You want to get laid.  Jimmy, tell me about it.  That's my suggestion, Melissa, okay?  Okay.  All right, good luck, sweetheart.  Thank you.  And we're going to get to Russ in California in a second, because he wants to talk about  sexual anorexia.  But that always reminds me, whenever I think about sexual anorexia, I think, well, you know, 
[03:42:30]  Orange is the New Black.  I don't know why I think of that show.  Is this mine?  Oh, it is.  I thought you were running over to snatch this from me.  Orange is the New Black.  House of Cards.  Arrested Development.  Are you ready for the next big thing from Netflix?  Netflix really has gotten amazing with their series.  Series is.  And don't forget Derek.  The Great Ricky Gervais' show is on.  Well, prepare yourself for Notorious.  It's Netflix's newest comedy special with my good pal, international stand-up sensation 
[03:43:00]  Russell Peters.  Russell started doing stand-up as a kid in his native Toronto, and he is now one of the  biggest comics in the world.  He really is one of the biggest grossing comics in the world.  With over 75 million views on YouTube, nearly a million Facebook fans, and one of the most  diverse audiences on Earth, Russell sells out arenas in, like, London's, I'm sorry, Madison  Square Garden, the Sydney Royal Opera House, and I think he has sold out the O2 in London.  He's also launching with Russell's new special, Notorious, is Russell Peters vs. the World. 
[03:43:30]  It's an exclusive four-part series that takes you behind the scenes on his tour and has  tons of great outtakes and interviews with his family and friends.  Do not miss Notorious, which is his special, and Russell Peters vs. the World, streaming  only on Netflix, and I love Russell, so I'm really happy for him, and my buddy Greg Rogel  is in that documentary, too.  He's touring with Russell, and he's already getting hits off it, so check Russell out on  Netflix.  Hi, Russ, in California.  Speaking of Russell, we go right to Russ, who says, sexual addiction called sexual anorexia. 
[03:44:00]  Have I heard of it?  Yes, I have.  I'm not 100% familiar with what it is, though.  Hey, yeah, Jimmy, thanks for taking my call.  Is that when you starve yourself from sex?  Yeah, that's it, exactly.  And you do things to make yourself unattractive, and you try to, you know, it's basically most  of the mechanisms of food anorexia, except it's around sex, and there's a lot of addictive.  I had, like, a major freakout yesterday. 
[03:44:30]  I don't know if you want some quick background.  I'm 44.  I'm a trucker.  About 100 pounds overweight, and I'm also a virgin.  Are you a virgin?  I'm a virgin, and I always...  Were you molested?  I think it comes just from having extremely neglectful parents.  I mean, unless it's really deeply...  Okay.  Have you always been a fat guy, or were you a fat kid?  Oh, yeah, I've always been fat. 
[03:45:00]  So you've probably never felt attractive at all.  Right.  I mean, do you get turned on?  Like, do you want to have sex?  Do you jack off?  I jack off, but I can only do it if it's fantasy.  Like, I literally have never jacked off to a person I know in real life.  Right.  If I, like, see somebody, and even, like, a celebrity or a porn star, and I get, you  know, I see a bio, or I see an interview or something, I'm immediately turned off to  them.  It has to be totally fantasy, you know? 
[03:45:30]  So basically, they have to be objects to a certain degree.  Like, and again, I have only a little knowledge of sexual anorexia from what I've heard in  certain 12-step groups.  But what it sounds like to me is this complete...  You said your parents were neglectful, so maybe you have this whole lack of connection  thing, like, you don't want to have any true bond or true deep connection, or maybe the  risk of sex will get you so into somebody mentally, and then they own you or they have  something over you.  But it sounds like your complete avoidance of any connection with a real person. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Even your job, are you an over-the-road trucker?  Yeah.  Even your job takes you away from any center...  Well, I mean, that's kind of why I ended up, I think, doing this.  But I was kind of, you know, I was going to ask you, like, do the...  If I went to, like, SA or the other places you were talking about, do they do any kind  of...  Has it been heard of in those groups, you know?  Oh, God, yeah.  I would say any 12-step sexual meeting. 
[03:46:30]  Now, the ones I've heard of are SA, SLA, and there's a bunch of other ones.  But I would suggest, what I would suggest is going to one of those meetings.  And if you hold, or after we get off the call, if you hold, I will write down to the  screener to suggest a 12-step meeting.  Fuck, I'll just say, I would suggest go to an SLA meeting.  I've heard good things about them.  Again, I can't vouch for whether they were going to work for you or not, but I've heard  very positive things about them. 
[03:47:00]  So maybe you want to look up SLA online and try it.  But from what I understand and what I've been told, there's quite a bit of knowledge about  sexual anorexia in those groups and from a lot of those people.  Great.  Thank you, Jim.  I will say you will not feel alone.  So that would be my suggestion, okay?  Okay.  Thanks, man.  Okay, buddy.  Good luck.  Hi, Steve in Philly.  Your son's an addict and stole from you twice.  What do you do?  Yeah, how you doing?  Hi, buddy.  I stole from my parents, too, and I was drinking. 
[03:47:30]  I saw you in Doylestown, just a real quick comment.  Thank you.  Great show.  Thank you, buddy.  What is your son addicted to?  He's addicted to heroin, Jim.  He's actually come off and on at least eight times that I know of.  And last year, he was living with me.  To make a long story short, he stole about $700 from me.  It took him about five or six months to admit it.  So he gets out of a recovery house, and I think he's doing good.  And last night, I discovered another $300 missing from my bank account here when I was sleeping. 
[03:48:00]  He stole my card and threw the money out.  I think he had known the code from a while back.  Like, I never changed it or anything.  You should change it, yeah.  Yeah.  And you know, Tim, the thing is, he's my son, and you, like, really, really want to trust him.  You know?  How old is he?  He's 24.  Okay, so he's old enough to be on his own.  Why is he living at home?  I just, he had nowhere to go, Jim.  He has no home.  He stole from his mom before she lives up the mountains. 
[03:48:30]  And, you know, he really had literally nowhere to go.  He had no job.  I got him a job.  And just last night, I kicked him out.  And he said, I have nowhere to go, Dad.  And I said, you need to go.  That's the second time you stole from me.  This isn't a three-strike option.  You're done.  Yeah, I think that's very fair of you, because, you know, I know that, again, I don't have  any children, but I understand that, you know, a parent loving a kid, it's very easy for  me to say, show them tough love, but it's very hard to do, because God forbid something  happens, and then you have guilt for the rest of your life. 
[03:49:00]  Do you go to any 12, there are, I think it's almost harder for people who live with addicts.  They have, there's Al-Anon, there's Naranon, there's all these 12-step programs for the  people who have to deal with the addict and with the alcoholic, because I almost think  you guys have it harder, because you can't just stop the substance.  So the way you contribute, and it's not your fault, but you do contribute to the cycle because  you're affected by it.  Like, maybe not changing the passcode. 
[03:49:30]  Maybe, on some deep psychological level, you did that on purpose, this way, if he ever  needed it, he wouldn't have to go out and rob somebody, he could just get the money that  way.  Who knows?  But I would suggest going to one of those 12-step programs, where you deal with the people,  because it's really easy, like, as a parent or the spouse of an addict or an alcoholic,  go, what the fuck, I'm not doing that, I don't have the problem.  And in a way, you're right.  But the reality is that living with people who are in active addiction affects you greatly. 
[03:50:00]  And it changes who you are, and it changes the way you do things, and it changes your  thinking, and it's a very silent and subtle give and take.  You do this, I react this way, I react this way, then you go act out.  And it becomes this weird fucking dance that's not being done consciously.  So, I would suggest, talk to other fathers who have sons who have stolen, because believe 
[03:50:30]  me, there's thousands and thousands and thousands of them, going to 12-step groups who are married  to people who steal from them, who are dating to people who have children or parents that  steal from them.  And you can relate to these people, and they can speak to you from experience, and when  this happens, you can call them on the phone.  And it sounds douchey, but to get support from a guy who's going through it, not some  fucking cornball pop psychologist, not someone with a college degree, but with a guy who  is doing it, or who has navigated it already. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  Awesome, Jim.  Thanks a lot, man.  Yeah, man.  Look up Al-Anon or Nar-Anon online, and investigate a couple of meetings.  You'll meet great people there, and you're definitely not alone, alright?  Alright, thanks, buddy.  Good luck, buddy.  Alright, thanks.  Okay, hi, Nathan in Long Island wants to ask Jim about my sleeping habits.  I have another sleep study next Monday, I believe, and I'm scared to take it.  It's for my, the final test I'm taking is for the mask for central apnea, and for complex 
[03:51:30]  apnea, which is the central and the obstructive.  And I'm scared for the ASV machine that if it doesn't work, I'm hopeless.  So, yes, Nathan, what's up?  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  So, anyway, I know you used to mention on ONA quite often how awful your sleeping habits  were.  Yeah.  And, again, I haven't heard as much of that lately, so what I'm wondering is, have you  managed to improve your sleeping habits, and if so, how?  Because I could definitely use the help.  No, I've just stopped babbling about it.  I haven't even been trying to use my dumb BiPAP machine, which I should have, just to  get the mask.  I take a little Valerian route sometimes. 
[03:52:00]  You get that natural in a health food store or whatever.  That helps.  But my problem is that I don't sleep properly when I am asleep.  So, I need the mask.  The next step is, I think I've kind of stopped talking about it because, A, it bores everybody,  and, B, I know that I have this test coming up, which I pushed back once because I was  in L.A., and I'm scared to take it.  I am scared that it won't work and that I will be hopeless.  So, you know, I have to go next week.  Next Monday is a big night. 
[03:52:30]  You know, look, I'm sure I'll fall asleep, and they'll get the results, and I'll get the  mask, and I'll be okay.  But I'll know more in a couple of weeks, all right?  Okay.  Thank you, Nathan.  I still don't go to bed on time.  I stopped watching a lot of porn late at night, though.  That has helped slightly.  But, you know, for some reason, my dick still, you know, winds up in my hand like a chimp.  I can't seem to stop doing that.  Let's see.  John in Detroit, been in a relationship for a year.  You wanted to get married during it, but now they're broken up, and she's moved in with  someone else.  Okay, what's up, buddy? 
[03:53:00]  Hey, Jimmy.  Thank you so much for taking my call.  I really appreciate it.  Sure, John.  Hey, so basically, here's the thing is that I did this girl for about a year and a half.  We were a long-distance relationship, and during that time, I was trying to get into medical  school as well.  So she kind of took a back seat.  She wasn't really my top priority.  And we talked last night, and she told me she felt like she was my fourth or fifth priority,  but she really did see settling down with me. 
[03:53:30]  Okay.  But we broke up about a year ago, and it's been killing me.  And so I really do want to get back together with her.  But she was someone else.  I just want to know, how do I show her that she is my number one priority now, that it's  not so much all the schoolwork, and it's not so much everything else, but how do I go about  showing her?  Well, hold on.  Let me ask you, hold on.  How long were you with her?  A year, you said, right?  About a year, a year and a half, about.  Now, I understand the grief that comes with that, but let me stay here. 
[03:54:00]  When you're trying to get into medical school, that's a huge thing to do, and it's a huge  undertaking, and I think that you need a partner who understands they're going to take a back  seat to medical school.  She should take a back seat to medical school.  She's going to land a doctor, or a dentist, or whatever you're going to become, or a psychiatrist.  She's going to land a fucking doctor.  So I think that someone has to be willing to take a back seat to that. 
[03:54:30]  Is she living with someone else?  She is.  That's the big thing, is that she's now, she has moved on.  She's living with somebody else right now.  They've been, I don't know how exactly how long they've been together.  It's been less than a year, obviously, because we've only been broken up for about a year,  so it's been less than that.  Well, maybe she wants this new person more than she wants you, as painful as that is.  You know, I think that's part of it.  It is, I think, I truly think that she does love me.  She's shown me a lot of things that she does truly love me, but it's just that she couldn't 
[03:55:00]  handle the fact that she was, you know, my third or fourth priority.  Let me ask you a question.  Pardon my interruption.  Let me ask you.  Yeah.  Do you think that, are you in medical school, first of all?  I'm not right now.  I've been accepted, so I will be starting next year, though.  So then she won't be your priority, then medical school will be?  Maybe, maybe not. 
[03:55:30]  I've done a lot of research about it, how, what family life is like, and there are a lot  of people that are starting medical school that have families, that have spouses.  Yes, but they may have spouses who understand that process.  You see, it sounds to me like she wants somebody who's just going to give her a lot more time,  and you're about to enter into something which is going to take even more time, and you're  going to be able to give her less time.  So it's like, do you really want to have that fucking weight, that anvil hanging over you?  Or when you're supposed to go out on a Friday, and you promised you'd go out, and all of 
[03:56:00]  a sudden you realize, like, fuck, I'm not as prepared for this exam as I thought.  I've got to cancel Friday.  Do you really want to not cancel Friday because you made a promise to her?  Like, you want to cancel, like, do you really want to sacrifice studying because you promised  her on a Friday night you'd go out?  Like, that problem is not going to go away, I don't think.  No, you're right, because it takes such a, that it is such a huge priority, but.  And it should be.  I don't want a doctor who spent too much time appeasing his chick in medical school. 
[03:56:30]  You know, you want to, you want to, if this is going to be the course of your life, I would  think you want to do it well.  You asked me what I think you could do to tell her.  If you mean it, and if you're willing to make the sacrifice, and if you can make her number  one, okay, maybe you write her an email and say, look, this is where I am, and this is  how I feel.  But you have to respect her answer.  Meaning, if she says no thanks, you have to move on.  Right.  And that's my big thing, is because we actually, we just talked about it last night, because 
[03:57:00]  it was, like I said, we were long distance, and last night we really, I finally was able  to tell her how I feel, but I don't know, how do I move on from this?  How do I, how do I kind of get her out of my mind?  Because I, to be honest with you, I can't, I think about her constantly, and I can't get  her out of my mind.  Have you dated anyone else?  No, I, it's, I, I've tried, I've, I've gone on multiple dates with a number of different  girls, but at every single time, I was disappointed that it's really, it's not her that's sitting  across the table from me.  Did she break up with you? 
[03:57:30]  She did.  Okay, that, that, that, sometimes that makes it harder, because the control, we feel like  we want it to end differently, or we have unfinished business with the person, um, a long distance  relationship, too, is easy, easier to idealize a person, uh, because you're not with them  every day.  It's easier to go, wow, and how about looking at the fact that her breaking up with you because  you're trying to get into medical school is a little bit selfish, and she will do the  same thing while you're in medical school. 
[03:58:00]  That won't change, and if she's moved on, the only way you can get on with it is you have  to get on with it, and you have to accept the fact, and I know that's easy to say, but  you've got to accept the fact that she's moved on, if that's what, if that's what comes of  it, the way to move on, dude, is you start dating other people, get your fucking ass into  medical school, and realize you are probably going to be way more successful than whoever  she marries.  Okay.  And I know that that's not a, a, a great pain pill right now, but how old are you?  I'm 24. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, I know, and I, and I know it's easier for me to say I'm at almost twice your age.  You will absolutely forget this chick, and I know it doesn't seem like you will.  You will absolutely go through medical school and be a doctor and fucking have a great life  and have two cars and a fucking, a six-bedroom house, and I'm telling you, go to medical school.  Don't get, don't get sidetracked by some bullshit chick who, I'm sure she's a great girl, but  by some bullshit girl who's going to give you a flack about trying to get yourself into 
[03:59:00]  medical school, what kind of work does she do?  Um, so, she's kind of an anomaly.  She actually was accepted to a medical school as well, but she's kind of like a family, very  family-oriented, and so she, she put that off for a while to kind of take care of her  sister, so.  Oh, okay.  Well, good, maybe she's a nice person.  But, uh, I would suggest go to medical school.  Let her take care of her sister and live with the new guy and be a fucking dental assistant  while you're over there making the big bucks. 
[03:59:30]  All right.  Well, thank you so much, Jim.  I really appreciate all your help.  Okay, man.  I really hope, uh, I really hope that I can help you there.  And now, we have very, we have to wrap up because I have a read, but let's just go really  quick.  Mark in New York, uh, doesn't understand why the ex won't come back, but still, but still  contacts you?  Yeah, Jimmy.  She basically, give you a very brief synopsis, as I know you gotta wrap the show up, but  basically, three and a half year relationship, we broke up numerous times, got back  together, now she's with another guy for about a year and a half, and throughout the 
[04:00:00]  year and a half, she continually, at least once a month, comes back and fucks me.  Yeah.  The new guy has a small dick, it's not passionate enough, bah, bah, bah, bah, and basically  it's fucking me up, because I have a new girl who I'm absolutely in love with, but I  can't get her off my mind.  I understand the attraction.  Here's what it is.  I hate to say it like this.  She wants her cake, and she wants to eat it, too.  She wants what she wants.  She wants the combination of you, too.  And she also likes knowing you're there, just in case things with him don't work out.  She likes keeping you on a little fishing line, and you kind of like the same attraction. 
[04:00:30]  You obviously like the idea of knowing, hey, it's a possibility, just in case.  You both gotta let go.  If she can't let go, and you really like your new girl, then fuck it.  You gotta let go, because you're gonna wreck your new relationship over a girl who obviously  wants to be with someone else, and is selfish enough to keep you on a string.  I agree.  I keep hearing that the only thing is, like the last gentleman just said, I can't get  her off my mind, only due to the fact about the passionate level of sex that we use. 
[04:01:00]  Understandable.  But you can get her off your mind.  You're choosing not to.  You're choosing to idealize her.  And again, that would be my suggestion.  Cut it off.  It will hurt for a while, but if you really like this new girl, fuck it, man.  Give the new girl shit that she deserves.  The old girl's with someone.  Fuck her.  Stick with the new girl who's given you everything.  Copy that.  Copy that.  Good luck, my friend, okay?  Eddie Vedder, Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, Mike McReady, and Matt Cameron make up, obviously,  Pearl Jam, one of the most popular and influential bands of the past 25 years. 
[04:01:30]  From their debut album, 10, in the early 90s, to their newest release, Lightning Bolt, Pearl  Jam remains a major force in rock.  The band's extreme loyalty to their fans, strong social and political principles, and restless  experimentation are at the core of their continued success.  The album is produced by Grammy award-winning producer Brendan O'Brien, who's been working  with Pearl Jam since the release of Versus 20 years ago.  Lightning Bolt includes the singles Mind Your Manners and Sirens. 
[04:02:00]  The band is back out on tour in North America, supporting Lightning Bolt and continuing to thrill  their fans with an amazing live show.  So check out PearlJam.com for the latest news on the band, their current tour dates, information  on how to join their official fan club, the 10 Club, and their brand new album, Lightning  Bolt, which is available on iTunes now.  And Pearl Jam is out on tour.  That's a big news for Pearl Jam fans.  I should have had Travis read this, so I could throw tennis balls the entire time at his  fucking dumb face, because he loves Pearl Jam.
