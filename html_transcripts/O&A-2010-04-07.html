<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a phone call from Jay Moore performing Colin Quinn impressions, followed by a rapid-fire exchange of vulgar jokes and banter between Opie and Anthony, incorporating a movie quote game using Colin Quinn's lines.  The conversation quickly shifted to Jesse James' alleged sex tapes with Sandra Bullock, with graphic details from Ian Halperin's blog being read aloud and debated.  This discussion incorporated analysis of the legal implications and comedic potential of Halperinâ€™s reporting.  Current events then dominated the conversation, including Tiki Barber leaving his pregnant wife, Brett Favre becoming a grandfather, and the death of Corey Haim, all discussed with crude humor and offensive remarks.  A significant portion focused on Spirit Airlines' new carry-on bag fees, provoking angry commentary from the hosts and a caller.  Baseball was also discussed, including critiques of game length and John Sterling's home run calls.  The segment concluded with further irreverent discussion about air travel and LaGuardia airport, punctuated by interruptions, tangents, and comedic sound effects.


The show continued with crude jokes targeting San Francisco and Nancy Pelosi, followed by a discussion of a YouTube video of Bob Kelly reacting to the smell of blossoming trees, which he compared to semen.  Celebrity news, including the Jim Carrey/Jenny McCarthy breakup (announced via Twitter) and Ashton Kutcher's tweets, were discussed. A substantial portion focused on the Times Square "wilding" incident, expressing frustration at the lack of condemnation from black leaders and the celebratory welcome of Sharp James.  The racial dynamics surrounding the incident and the contrasting reactions were analyzed.  Mayor Bloomberg's pedestrian mall plan also received commentary.  A phone call with Ian Halperin further discussed the Sandra Bullock sex tape allegations, including claims of Nazi paraphernalia. Halperin defended his reporting, reiterating his sources and challenging Bullock to deny the claims.  The segment concluded with mockery of Representative Hank Johnson's comments about Guam potentially tipping over due to overpopulation. Bob Kelly was mentioned as a brief studio guest, and Tom Papa was announced as an upcoming guest.


A phone interview with Ian Halperin dominated the next segment.  He further defended his story about Jesse James' infidelity with Sandra Bullock, including the alleged sex tapes, mentioning a photo of James wearing a Nazi hat and claiming Bullock knew about the affair before her Oscar acceptance speech.  The discussion became highly vulgar and sexually explicit, with the hosts and Halperin using crude language.  Brendan from whatwithtylerderdendo.com then called in, aggressively challenging Halperin's journalistic integrity and past predictions, leading to a heated exchange.  Tom Papa then joined the show in studio. The conversation shifted to Tiger Woods, a prediction of a major film star's sex change (later revealed to be Mike Myers), and a detailed, sexually suggestive analysis of a scene from *The Shining*.  The discussion returned to Tom Papa's stand-up performances, *The Marriage Ref*, and the possibility of him appearing on Martha Stewart's show.


A significant portion of the following segment focused on the hosts' adolescent experiences with their friends' mothers, involving humorous and sexually explicit descriptions.  This transitioned into a discussion of Jerry Seinfeld, his discomfort with silence, and anecdotes about his interactions with people, including a story about a meeting with Opie's father.  The segment also included a prank call to Mike Francesa, commentary on a clueless soccer reporter, and playback of offensive and racist audio excerpts from Richard Nixon's recordings. The Lollapalooza lineup, a Lady Gaga impersonation, and further sexually explicit commentary about Lady Gaga concluded this segment.  Tom Papa, again in studio, discussed his upcoming Martha Stewart appearance.  A behind-the-scenes segment with Sam Roberts featuring "gayest songs" from the staff's iPods, repeatedly mentioning Foundry, was also included.


The final segment began with crude and sexually explicit comments about pictures of Lady Gaga's body.  The conversation then shifted to Kilroy Was Here graffiti, followed by further graphic descriptions of female genitalia.  A news item about a comedic Star Wars animated series and opinions on George Lucas and Seth Green were discussed.  A large portion focused on the hosts' drinking habits, with Anthony detailing a recent vomiting episode.  The broadcast concluded with further crude humor and banter, including brief mentions of *Ron and Fez* and *Poon and Peener*, and a referenced clip of a female news anchor falling out of her chair.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up? It's Sam.  Hey, it's E-Rock.  Sam, whatever happened to Jay Moore?  Who cares?  He got a TV show and then stopped talking to us.  Yeah, well, he's a very famous guy now,  but there was a time when he would call our very own radio show,  The Opie and Anthony Show, with impressions.  I think it was only because Colin Quinn was in the studio.  Well, listen for yourself.  Jay Moore's on the line, but I can't get it.  Oh my God, Jay Moore, don't go anywhere.  Can't you use the keyboard?  No.  Hiya, boys.  There he is.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Before I put on my friend Jay, I wanted to fan how short I am. 
[00:00:30]  Another ah.  You boys, boy, you're good.  But I, a few days in a row, you've been tagging good old Al.  Yeah.  I'm going to do all the commercials.  Like the quicker picker-upper when I work on my nails.  I don't have Propecia.  Yeah, people are saying you have alopecia.  Alopecia, Propecia.  That's why I'm hooked on phonics, Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you.  Because I don't know certain words.  I just know in 88 minutes my hair was orange.  Yeah, it was.  I was Pesci and JFK.  My wig was crooked and I wanted to throw a gay party with a friend.  Let me cut that down.  I'm so impressed, Jimmy.  You get to tell jokes and you think you're special because you're painted a fucking male.  What movie? 
[00:01:30]  I'm going to guess Glenn, Gary, Glenn Ross.  No.  Why don't you just like embarrass everybody, you idiot?  Oh, that's been great, Colin.  That's why he's not here.  I'm in your consciousness and just yell out random quotes and go, okay, quick, what movie?  And then when they're wrong, go, I'm smarter than you.  I knew what I was saying.  Yo, you should let Tracy Morgan talk to Jimmy.  I got schizophrenia.  I just got my belly off in preschool. 
[00:02:00]  It's belly.  And a doo-doo diaper, pepper.  Yeah.  Jay, please put Colin in Reservoir Dogs.  Guys, look, you know, obviously there was a wretch in this whole operation.  And I'm no more than me.  I'm pretty goddamn sure it wasn't you.  The guy definitely fucking freaked out in there, but he seems, I don't know, he seems pretty  okay now with a big guy.  I don't know.  Holy shit. 
[00:02:30]  I mean, Jesus Christ, you're holding a desert eagle.  He's asking you if you want to bark all day.  A guy like that doesn't have one of his hands.  He's getting in touch with Joe, get this guy to the hospital.  He's getting blood on my shoes.  Finicky I am when it comes to my L.A. gear sneakers.  Holy shit.  Tell the goddamn words, stupid.  That's stupid.  Holy.  That's Colin driving around the valley with Bobby Kelly in the back.  I broke my fucking stomach, man. 
[00:03:00]  Are you going to be okay, stupid?  Shut up, you're bleeding all over my car.  That dumb bitch.  I'm probably going to shoot some cop if that's the difference between me doing, you know,  10 years.  Bye.  You know, that's what I talk about in a meeting today.  I was really stressed out.  I went to like five meetings in 10 minutes.  That's what I do.  They go, hi, my name's Colin, and then I run out the room and go to another one.  Because I don't want to listen to anybody else talk. 
[00:03:30]  They're boring.  They always outdo each other.  Holy shit, John.  Is that a fucking perfect Colin?  I think he's having a nervous breakdown out there now.  Oh, damn.  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  If you're going to take your family to the Javits Center for the car show, that it's a gang magnet.  You might not want to bump into anyone while you're there.  No, you might not want to step on a toe or look at someone with disrespect or make fun of someone's tooth or the grill. 
[00:04:00]  It's a gang magnet.  It's a gang magnet.  You know how many families go there?  You know how many fathers and sons go there to kind of take a look at some good rides?  A car show, son.  See what kind of concept cars there are.  This is going to be fun.  I'm out of touch.  Bodacious tot.  It's not funny or sexy or accurate.  And he can't send you some gratitude posies?  Why don't they have fucking broad writers in papers? 
[00:04:30]  What are you doing?  They're terrible writers.  You don't like broad writers?  Some posies.  Who the fuck laughs at that?  She wrote posies.  Fucking dumb broad.  You too, boy, if you fuck with me.  The police are going to have to come and get me.  Off your ass.  That's how I'm going out.  For the punk motherfuckers that are showing out.  Nigga start to rumble.  You want to mumble.  Mix them and cook them in a pot like gumbo.  Oh, shit. 
[00:05:00]  That's pointed at your ass.  Give it up smooth.  Ain't no telling when I'm down for a gat move.  Keep you dancing.  The crime record like Charles Manson.  AK-47 is the Duke.  What's up?  What are you doing in L.A.?  It's not you.  Why is it so hot?  You're not an L.A. guy.  Bob is having trouble with the chair.  Sorry, I can all stand.  Dude, yes.  You know what?  I am an L.A. guy kind of now.  Why?  I don't know.  What happened?  I quit smoking.  I woke up every day.  Ran up a canyon. 
[00:05:30]  You brought up canyons?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  It's so weird.  Obi and Anthony.  Live next.  THE END 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  Thank you. 
[00:10:30]  Thank you. 
[00:11:00]  Thank you. 
[00:11:30]  Thank you. 
[00:12:00]  And then they write, no, Tiger Woods isn't sexting a gal pal.  Well, no one thought that.  I thought so.  You wanted to make a story out of it, you dumb paper.  If they actually heard it, it would be really...  You dumb paper.  The paper's dumb.  The paper's dumb.  The paper's dumb.  It would even be more scandalous because he said, could you tape my pud?  Right?  Or imagine it's a great word for a dick.  My pud.  You like that one? 
[00:12:30]  You know, like, you're like, you're like nine or eight, yeah.  You suck my pud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You suck my pud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The word pud rules.  Yeah.  That's a favorite.  Yeah.  That's all it is.  But God, he had the misfortune of picking up, I don't know, a phone.  Yeah, what's he supposed to do?  You know, he's fucking, he uses a phone.  What, is he not supposed to have a phone?  They're going to do a bunch of things like that, I'm sure, when he's teeing off. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, look at that.  He's got his balls in his hand.  All right, what's that supposed to mean?  Booyah.  He's going to booyah some chick.  Yeah.  Well, you watching?  Of course you're watching.  I'm going to watch.  Yeah, why not?  And you don't watch golf for the most part?  No, not, I usually watch the last, you know, the last round that they play.  There's not, I was going to say, is there anything better?  But then everyone's going to come up with a million things that are better.  So I stopped myself. 
[00:13:30]  But when you're just laying around on a Sunday and the final round of a really good golf tournament's on.  Unprotected sex.  Well, I know.  That's why I stopped myself.  I knew you would have one right off the edge.  Yeah, that's always good.  So.  Feels cushy.  So we got that.  Yeah.  And Sandra Bullock breaks her silence to deny Ian Halpern's claim.  She had a sex tape.  You know.  Fucking Ian.  Just that.  And if Ian doesn't call us today, we never talk to him again.  Yeah, because now he's in the legitimate news. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Every fucking news organization that's carrying this story is mentioning Ian's name.  Yes.  Because he's the one that said that there was some kind of a sex tape.  He alleged to a sex tape.  Not only a sex tape, something with duty on Sandra Bullock's fucking mustache area.  And him dressed like a Nazi.  Could you get that story there?  And fucking Sieg Heiling.  Oh, wait.  I might have it.  Like all kinds of shit.  All right.  I got it.  Sandra Bullock breaks her silence in response to rumors of a sex tape with husband Jesse  James.  Sandra Bullock has finally broken her silence since news of Jesse James' alleged affairs 
[00:14:30]  made headlines denying the existence of a purported sex tape with her estranged husband.  There's no sex tape, she told People.com.  There never has been one and there never will be one.  Oh, Jesus.  Her statement is in response to writer Ian Halpern's.  Google it.  Google it.  For all the people that don't like Ian on our show, this is why we have Ian Halpern on  our show.  All of a sudden, he falls right into it.  Ian Halpern's gossip blog that claims James possesses an extremely graphic sex tape in 
[00:15:00]  which he's dressed in Nazi regalia and is having profoundly laced sex with the actress.  In addition, a RadarOnline.com report also claims that while James carried on affairs with  four alleged mistresses, he documented his exploits in more than a dozen homemade sex tapes.  Most of the tapes feature a mass amount of Nazi paraphernalia, an insider said.  It's all really quite disturbing.  According to a source who watched one of the videos, a naked woman is seen on her knees  with her hands bound while James is wearing a Nazi hat and waving his arm in a salute. 
[00:15:30]  What a guy.  How do you not love this guy, Jesse James?  I know.  He's a degenerate.  He can fuck my girl anytime.  He's a good boy.  He was shouting and singing and appearing to swig from a bottle of bourbon every now  and then, the source said.  I read a different version of this where there was like duty involved.  Duty?  Wow, that is dirty.  What would Tyler Durden do had a funny, I think, response to it, but I don't know how  sarcastic it was or if they added details just to be sarcastic. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, they don't seem to, I think it was the guy that called in, not a particular fan of  Ian.  Oh, that's Brandon.  No, no.  Brandon from whatwithtylardurndu.com.  Yeah, I was reading on his side that they, uh.  Well, they had a little battle on our program.  Yes, they did.  The other day, so.  They might battle again today.  He was not at all happy with Ian.  He's had it with Ian Halperin.  He's had it up to here with Ian.  He really has.  I'm tired of Ian.  Is there a duty line in that story, Danny?  I think I might have read it off that site.  Duty?  Something about duty on, a duty mustache. 
[00:16:30]  Did you read that too, Jimmy?  Yes.  Uh, hang on.  I think I have it.  All right, good.  People.com didn't mention shit mustache.  No, no.  Nothing like that.  But just the fact that she had a break of silence because of that idiot is great.  Who's nude somewhere with another model playing a fucking saxophone.  Yeah, playing my saxophone.  Google it.  Norton.  Yeah, it's on Ian's website.  All right, what does it say?  Ian Undercover says, Ian Undercover confirmed late last night that Jesse James has the goods 
[00:17:00]  on his wife.  It includes James smearing feces on Bullock's upper lip during various types of anal sex.  That's a dirty Sanchez.  He gave her the dirty Sanchez?  Well, according to Ian Halperin's blog.  Yes.  But, like, why would Ian print that?  How are you not getting sued?  During various types of anal sex.  Lots of profanity.  Wait, you can have various types?  Parties.  Sure.  Yeah, he's fingers, dildos, cock. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  And a leather-clad James sporting a Hitler mustache with brown hat with a swastika ramming  a handcuffed Bullock's asshole with a shotgun in his left hand.  This in from a close friend of the couple who has been in contact with both parties.  Developer.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  Is he suggesting that Sandra Bullock took a shotgun barrel up her asshole? 
[00:18:00]  No, no, no, no.  The guy was holding the shotgun.  Read that again.  It looks like...  It sounded like shotgun barrel up her butt.  Really?  Let's see.  Lots of profanity hurled from both parties and a leather-clad James sporting a Hitler mustache  with a brown hat with a swastika,  ramming a handcuffed Bullock's asshole  with a shotgun in his left hand.  All right, so he might have been...  Fuck you in the ass.  He's implying that he was fucking her in the ass 
[00:18:30]  and holding a shotgun in his left hand.  Like Oswald.  All right, I got you.  Never saw that Oswald picture.  No, he was holding the freak Hewlett pamphlet  and he has the actress on his dick and the gun.  I mean, they have close...  And Marilyn Monroe on his dick.  With Jane Manziel's head.  This is coming from close friends.  Yeah, what friends of the couple have seen this?  I know.  Hey, sit down.  We got to show you something.  This is great.  After we watch Speed, let's pop this in. 
[00:19:00]  Close friends.  Unless he's making it so ridiculous  that no reasonable person could ascertain it would be true.  Unless that's the way he gets around it.  Well, I don't think so because he...  In my opinion, he runs a website that people look at  as kind of gossip and news to be true.  And somebody like Larry Flint, he's won a lot of his cases  because of parody. 
[00:19:30]  You're allowed parody.  You can make fun of people.  You can imply that things are happening sexually between people  if it's known to be parody.  Which Hustler Magazine and shit like that is known.  But this...  I don't know.  Boy, he's skating.  How great is it, though?  Oh, it's fucking fantastic.  They couldn't get a word out of Sandra Bullock.  And it's our pal Ian Halperin that makes her go,  holy shit, no.  I have to talk.  I have to talk immediately. 
[00:20:00]  It's saying, I'm getting rammed in the ass  with a fucking dirty Sanchez by a Nazi with a shotgun.  If this follows suit, Ian won't be on our show today.  Yeah, yeah.  This is how it works.  We built some people up.  We have a nice relationship.  And then they hit the real media.  Yeah.  And then they forget all about us.  Like, oh, yeah, those guys.  I don't need them anymore.  Yeah.  I'm on to bigger and better things.  So Ian better be on this show today.  Supposedly, he'll be on at 8 a.m.  to discuss that and other things.  All right.  Well, the countdown is on. 
[00:20:30]  He better be.  Yes.  He better be.  Yeah.  That's probably the same type of parody.  I bet you that that's the same thing.  You think?  Yeah, I do.  It's entertainment.  Because what did Larry Flint, he went to court because he had said follow.  Right.  Fucked his mother in an outhouse.  Fucked his mother.  In an outhouse.  In an outhouse.  It was so out there and so crazy.  And because of the medium it was in, which was Hustler, and it was obviously parody, he 
[00:21:00]  got away with it.  But the lawyer, I actually met the lawyer briefly, the real lawyer for Larry Flint, played by  Norton, who was amazing.  When he said in court, he goes, Mr. Falwell, have you ever had sex with your mother?  Oh!  Everybody's shocked.  Yeah.  He's going, well, of course you haven't.  Nobody thinks you.  Yeah, nobody thinks you did.  Great argument.  Look around, right?  Really is.  Who would believe that?  Yep.  Nobody would.  Wow, that is great.  Yeah, he actually had to ask him on the stand.  What a great angle.  You ever had sex with your mother?  Did you get sex with your mother? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Well, I have not.  She was a saint.  Wow, that's all right.  In an outhouse.  In the outhouse.  Larry Flint, boy, when he teased you, he really gave you a good ribbon.  Larry knew how to give a ribbing.  He certainly did.  Do you understand, in 1978 or whatever it was, nobody talked about Jerry Falwell like that.  No.  Not at all.  Fantastic.  In other news.  Fucking wheelchair-bound ghoul.  Alfea!  Alfea!  That was a great movie. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, fantastic.  Great movie.  I've got to watch that again now.  In other news, we start off our show different every day, by the way.  Ah, why not?  For the new people out there.  There's no real structure here.  We like it that way.  Tiki Barber.  Remember him?  Of course.  He was the Giants great.  Played for the New Jersey slash New York Giants.  Mm-hmm.  And now he's, what, a commentator?  And his brother, he's got a twin brother in the NFL, or was in the NFL.  Well, he's leaving his eight-month pregnant wife. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, fuck.  This has got to hurt a little bit.  For a 23-year-old former NBC intern.  Wow.  He's only 35, though, Tiki.  I thought he was older.  He's turning 35.  Yeah, he had an early retirement.  You sure he's only 35, though?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm reading it right now.  It says he turns 35.  He turns 35 today, actually.  I knew him.  And they got a picture of him with, who's the intern?  Jenny's his wife.  She's an Asian woman.  She's a pretty woman.  The blonde here.  The one that hates her father? 
[00:23:00]  I don't know.  When you're dating Tiki Barber, it's a little different.  Is it?  Yeah, there's a whole...  Is it to dad?  I don't know.  It depends on who dad...  Hopefully dad's a Jets fan.  She's really straight fixing dad's wagon.  It depends what kind of gifts dad gets out of the relationship.  If all of a sudden he's driving around in a nice, sporty fucking car...  I don't think it really matters.  ...or all of a sudden he's playing at a really good country club...  It might put certain things...  And he don't care as much.  It might put certain things to the back of his mind, but it's always there.  Tiki's giant fucking cock just slipping into his little girl. 
[00:23:30]  His little blonde-haired girl.  Sure, he was named after the thing that almost killed Greg Brady.  Greg Beatty.  Good improv.  Beatty.  Fucking retard.  Warren Brady.  Beatty.  I got it.  Yeah, thanks.  I figured I'd back you up with another one.  You sure did.  I was bombing alone.  He just jumped right in.  Nah.  Oh, fuck.  The target assessment said it wasn't destroyed.  That was a fucker. 
[00:24:00]  I had to drop another.  Yeah, that was a good carpet buy.  I did a lot of collateral damage.  So Tiki leaving his eight-month pregnant wife.  Wow.  You gotta wonder what the hell is going on in that relationship.  Wow.  What just dumps it?  Eight months pregnant?  Now, obviously, it doesn't seem like the right thing to do, but you don't know.  You're not behind those closed doors.  She might be a real you-know-what.  Yeah, but you could always say maybe she's like that because she's, you know, the hormones  are going and she's concerned about her pregnancy.  True.  And now she's got to deal with that. 
[00:24:30]  Maybe she's pregnant with someone else's kid.  Ah, see?  LT.  LT.  He just wants to be a baby daddy.  Yeah.  Maybe that's it.  You think?  Yeah.  And now we move on.  Speaking of football, you got Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  Brett Favre is a grandpa.  Wow.  And I think he's the only grandpa that is in the NFL on the active playing list. 
[00:25:00]  Now, how did that work out?  Like, how did that figure?  Well, Brett Favre is 40.  Right.  His little girl, who just had a baby, is 21.  They like to have kids young in that Favre family.  Yeah.  So Brett Favre is officially a grandpa.  Wow.  At 40.  That's something.  That's pretty young, right?  Yeah.  To be a grandfather.  Is she married?  Huh?  Is she married or baby daddy? 
[00:25:30]  I have no idea.  Wow.  Way.  Yeah.  Yeah, Brett Favre's daughter's all right.  That ain't bad.  Not bad, right?  That's not bad.  No, Jimmy?  You take her hair down.  She's got a big dopey pearl necklace on.  It's fucking horrendous, that necklace.  Yeah.  Wow.  It looks like anal beads.  Jimmy's.  That is terrible.  Jimmy's.  Jimmy's anal bead jokes are hilarious.  Thank you.  They're not jokes. 
[00:26:00]  Yes, they're memories.  You mean the ones I wake up screaming at all the night?  You have a point.  I got to want to say it so bad.  I can't, though, because you're touring right now.  I'm on tour.  And that's some fine material that people have to hear for themselves.  But wait until you hear Jim Norton's fucking anal bead fucking material.  So, Brett Favre, anything on that?  Whatever.  That's just a criminal headline, right?  Grandpa.  Grandpa.  Then, Anthony, you got that Corey Haim. 
[00:26:30]  Well, I hear he's dead.  He's still dead.  He obtained over 500 pills in the three months before his death.  500 pills over the three months.  He was still fighting his demons, I guess.  Wow.  Wow.  500 pills in the last three months of his life.  Damn.  How many pills is that a day?  You got about, let's call it 90 days.  So, times, you got five, about five and change pills a day.  It's not that many. 
[00:27:00]  Sounds like a lot more than it is.  Fraudulently changed pill.  Oh, five written change per day?  Mm-hmm.  What were they, though?  It'd be about five and a half.  Probably bad ones to mix, I bet you.  You think?  And that's per day.  Maybe there were some days he didn't do any.  Oh, wait.  Now we're talking 553 pills.  So, now we're talking that's six pills a day.  And maybe, you know, some days he didn't take any.  Or maybe some days he took one and decided, ah.  Mm-hmm.  And the next day, big handfuls.  So, good riddance. 
[00:27:30]  Good riddance.  Fuck.  I don't think the world needed another fucking B-movie.  Corey Feldman is still, ah.  Huh?  Very sad.  Is he?  Yeah.  Uh, Spirit Airlines.  Yes.  Will become, this is just enraging.  And I'm so glad we have a radio show.  Oh, wait.  We got a countdown here.  195 Valiums.  Okay.  Wow.  194 Soma.  What is Soma?  I think that's for bed duty.  It's?  No, no, no.  What's Soma for?  Anybody?  Soma. 
[00:28:00]  Maybe it helps your shit, because the next one's 149 tablets of Vicodin.  Vicodin.  Good old Vicodin.  And 15 Xanax.  Wow, you didn't believe in the Xanax too much, huh?  No.  Why would you if you get the Vicodin?  Xanax is a stepping stone to Vicodin and Valium.  Yeah.  And Soma, whatever that is.  Soma.  Soma sounds like a sleep aid.  Apparently it's a muscle relaxer.  Oh, that's good.  That's the one that makes you stop breathing.  And to get the duties out.  Those muscle relaxers make your diaphragm relax to the point where you're just not breathing anymore, and you drop dead. 
[00:28:30]  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  All right.  Spirit Airlines.  This is just enraging.  It just bothers me that companies can't figure out their shit.  And I know the economy isn't in the greatest place right now, but even when the economy is booming, companies can't figure out their shit.  Let me see if I can blame this on Obama.  Go ahead.  Oh, please.  Spirit Airlines will become the first airline to officially charge for carry-on bags.  Yeah.  That's amazing, huh?  But you want to go from point A to point B to see, I don't know, your grandma in Florida. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  So when you get on a plane, you have no choice.  You need to bring stuff so you can live in grandma's house for a couple days.  They want you to show up with the shirt on your back, or else you're paying.  That's pretty much what they're doing now.  This one isn't for a bag you could fit under the seat in front of you.  This is only if you're using overhead compartment.  So if you've got, like, a book bag that you could slide under, you're still good?  Yeah, that you could slide under the seat, you're good.  But if they start here, this is a lesson I learned from a man a long fucking time ago, man. 
[00:29:30]  They're not going to stop.  They start here, they're not going to stop, because when we get used to this, when we  get used to the $45 per bag for carry-ons, then they're going to go, oh, look, the public  is fucking paying for this.  Well, now it's going to be another $25 for every book bag that you push under the seat  in front of you.  We got used to the checked luggage pretty quickly, paying for that.  Yep.  We got used to that pretty quickly, and then they decided, you know something?  I'm noticing, and they probably did notice this, because I'm guilty of doing this. 
[00:30:00]  Because I will take a carry-on bag that is the maximum size for a carry-on bag.  You almost need some grease to get it in there.  It goes in, but it's in there.  It's actually set up to be the maximum size for carry-on.  Right.  I bought one, and when I'm going away, unless I'm going for two weeks somewhere, I'll pack  everything I need in that and in a backpack.  And it works. 
[00:30:30]  So I don't have to check a bag.  So they're probably noticing a lot more people are doing that, so why not start sticking  it to them and getting $45?  People are still freaking bringing regular luggage.  Oh, I know that.  Regular luggage.  But if I'm doing it, I'm sure other people are doing it.  Mine is just for convenience, though, because it's so nice not having to go to that fucking  carousel and watch the parade of luggage and watch people grabbing your shit.  You know, let me tell you something.  Maybe I'm an amazing person. 
[00:31:00]  I've never...  What?  That's the boring clip.  You need the...  That's bullshit clip.  Oh, no.  That was my non-reaction clip.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So you're an amazing person.  I must be an amazing person because I don't think I've ever grabbed anyone else's bag and  just jostled it around trying to see if it's mine.  Right.  Like, I pretty much know my bag.  And it's not fucking purple or fucking got the ribbon around it. 
[00:31:30]  It's a normal black, you know, bag that a lot of people have.  But you just kind of know your bag, you know?  Yeah, I think you're right.  You kind of know it when it comes out.  I love the people that need a huge pink ribbon or something, like they can't figure shit  out on their own.  And they're looking at every fucking thing that comes out, tossing it around.  Is this my...  And I know it's mine.  I'm looking down the line going like, could you put my fucking bag back on the goddamn  conveyor?  The worst, and Jimmy would know this better than anyone, when you fly into a city on a  Sunday and now you've got to wait forever for your baggage because they don't have as 
[00:32:00]  many baggage handlers or something.  What's that about?  Sometimes you will wait like an hour.  If you had a short flight of an hour, next thing you know, you're waiting for your bag  more time than when you were in the air.  Yep.  What's that about?  I actually have a little thing, a photo of a ticking bomb tied around mine, so I know  it's mine.  It always gives them a chuckle.  Chris on Long Island.  Let's say hi to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Good morning, ladies. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, buddy.  I hope you know, Myrtle Beach is a big destination, and really the only way to get to Myrtle  Beach from up here is LaGuardia on Spirit.  Spirit, yeah.  About nine years ago, it was maybe $1.50 to fly down there on a round trip.  Sure.  Now, I'm leaving today, 4 o'clock.  $270.  They're not charging me for the carry-on yet, but they are.  But they charge us for all golf clubs.  They charge me for all my luggage.  Now, when I get down there, I've got to rent the fucking car.  So, for four guys, you figure it's, what, $1,500 for the week? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Fuck them.  I'm driving next year.  12 hours to get down there.  For $1,500, I can rent an Escalade.  Yeah.  I think Spirit Airline is, like, economy, right?  I mean, it's, yeah, it's one of those, you know, just kind of get your, from point A to  point B with no amenities or anything.  I think my cheap-ass sister uses Spirit Airline to come back and forth from Florida to Long  Island.  And she listens every day.  She's a huge fan.  So, say hi to Terry. 
[00:33:30]  Like, she'll book her flight on Spirit, and we all just keep our fingers crossed that  the plane's going to land.  It's like, Jesus, JetBlue or something with a newer fleet.  What's wrong with you?  That's a nice paint job.  Supposedly, the seats on Spirit Airline are smaller, too, because they're trying to squeeze  more people into the plane.  Squeeze more people in?  That's great.  It's a shitbox.  The stewardesses are, like, 80-year-old transvestites.  It's just disgusting.  All right.  Hold on.  Why don't you slow down a little bit? 
[00:34:00]  When was the last time you saw a hot stewardess?  Sexy stews.  They're all, like, middle-aged to older women now that walk around, and then flamboyantly  gay gentlemen.  The gay guys, they get really mad because you asked for something.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, but I could use a cup of coffee.  Nice type.  Am I bothering you?  You're not his type.  If you were his type, he'd be waiting on you hand and foot.  I've seen it happen before.  Really?  Yeah.  What do I have to do?  Tighter jeans?  What am I doing?  The gay flight attendants. 
[00:34:30]  Skinny jeans?  What do I need to do?  We'll give more attention to guys that they want to have anal sex with.  In the butt?  I think.  Do we got the Bob Kelly song?  We got that, Travis?  Then they will women or guys that they don't find attractive.  Yeah.  That's what I think.  They're a bit on the bitchy side, man.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  Because they got their stewardesses.  They got a girl job.  It's like male nurses.  They fucking suffocate old people because they're miserable. 
[00:35:00]  All right, Chris.  Have fun at Myrtle Beach.  What are you doing?  You're playing a little golf, obviously.  Yeah, we're doing Caldonia, True Blue.  Going down to Pauley's.  You know, I've never been.  I mean, you're talking to me like I've been.  I would love to go to Myrtle Beach and do a little golf thing.  Because then I hear there's some nice strip clubs, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's called The Masters.  And it's going to be a rip-roaring time at The Masters this week.  Rip-roaring, Opie.  Wait, there's a strip club called The Masters?  Yes, it is.  Oh, that's classic. 
[00:35:30]  Why don't I know anything about Myrtle Beach?  I love my golf.  Yeah, it's supposed to be like the shit if you go down there and play some golf.  You get a little steak dinner, a little fucking golf, and a little pussy in your face.  Yeah, a few of the people I know.  I'll be able to go down there.  All right, yeah, save me a spot.  You got it.  All right, man.  I would actually do that.  Fuck it.  I would just go.  Seems all right.  Hey, it seems all right.  Like an all right sort.  It's a plaque lost last night.  You're in the water.  That was good.  Last night's loss was very good. 
[00:36:00]  Penny!  Penny!  Are you a penny?  Where's my penny?  They put me in a microwave.  Where's Penny?  Yeah.  Classic.  Giant big donuts.  I know.  It was fucking great.  There's a character on Lost named Zoe with glasses who is fucking terrible.  All I can think of when she's on the screen now is how awful an actress she is.  She's fucking horrible.  She is really, really bad.  She literally is like one step above going. 
[00:36:30]  She's horrid.  Terrible.  The whole new cast this year fucking stinks.  They could have just got fucking Danny, Travis, and Sam to play the new fucking Lost guys.  Wow.  That would be fun.  Yeah.  Watch you guys on Lost.  Hey, you.  Get with the big magnet donuts.  Oh.  So I guess next week is going to be a Hurley episode.  Is that what I was getting?  Yeah, and they show you the previews that Michael is on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Why'd they blow that?  I hate when they fucking do that.  You know, it's one of those things where it's like, I want to look, I want to look, 
[00:37:00]  ah, fuck why did I look?  Yeah, sure.  Like, it's such a quick thing, the preview of next week.  It's such a quick thing that I'm just hoping to get a little glimpse of something that gives  you some thought or something like, oh, maybe that was this or that.  But then they show you somebody like that, like Michael, and you're like, ah, okay, now  he's going to show up.  I think they were just, the writing is very bad this year.  I mean, bad, bad dialogue writing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone didn't tell this little tomato he wasn't supposed to die. 
[00:37:30]  Wow.  Oh, God.  We got a doozy.  How great was it to hear that song again, though, from fucking, uh, Drive Shaft?  My girlfriend almost fucking bit my nipples off.  Because she, she rooted for Charlie, she hates Charlie so bad.  Who doesn't?  She rooted for him to die.  She actually applauded when he died, when he drowned.  She was like, finally, yes!  And then he'd come back in a dream in season four, and she was like, no!  Not Charlie.  But he wouldn't come back.  She hates Charlie.  Shut up.  He doesn't bother me, even though he's really married to Kate in real life.  He is married to her? 
[00:38:00]  Yes, he's married to Evangeline Lilly.  Yeah.  What are you guys talking about?  What a guy.  Oh, Lost.  Oh, Lost.  Last night was actually a very good episode.  Was it good?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought, it actually felt like Lost used to feel.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's a good character, too.  So it's like, you know.  How many have they got left?  Five left.  Five to go, huh?  And five to go.  And they really has tied up a lot of loose ends.  A lot they haven't.  But what a bunch of garbage they threw in this year.  I know.  Shit.  They really should have just cut the bullshit out and stuck to, you know, the basics, clearing 
[00:38:30]  some shit up, making it feel like the rest of the series did, really take it up from  last season.  But it is kind of good that I like the fact that they, I don't want to, you know, do any  spoilers, but they brought What's-His-Name back, you know, talking about the, a bomb thingy  and stuff like that.  That was kind of cool.  Yeah, it wasn't surprising.  As soon as I saw him from the back, Lost is the worst, they'll show you somebody from  the back.  I know.  And it's supposed to be a mystery, and you already know who it is. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, you know exactly who it is.  It's like a Kate in a bad wig, or you can tell by the other one, we know who you are.  But it was very, the writing this year has been atrocious.  A lot of the new characters who are so, just one level and empty, and they suck as, they're  terrible actors.  And the writing is very lazy writing.  It's almost like they have three episodes worth of good shit, and they're just trying  to build around it.  And it's terrible.  It's fucking horrible.  I thought last night's, the opening of it was... 
[00:39:30]  What was the opening?  Well, first you got that little kid that was on that fucking Nickelodeon show.  What show was that, Travis?  Do you remember that?  He's got some little fat kid that was on some Nickelodeon show.  And then he ends up like, at one point he's got the guns, and they're in the jungle.  This is like a few weeks back.  And he's like, all right, hold it, hold it.  Like the tough guy with the gun.  And then there's scientists.  It's like, you can either, you're either proficient at one thing or the other, but they seem to 
[00:40:00]  be able to do it all.  And then some bumbling guy just flips a switch by accident last night.  No, don't hit that switch!  No!  The writing...  I'll turn it on!  That was such a ham-handed, stupid way of that happening.  It should have been some kind of more of a malfunction than human error.  Why is that guy even in the room, if he's that stupid, to flip a main switch on some  dopey machine? 
[00:40:30]  It's horrendous fucking writing.  And I mean lazy.  And there's a scene, let's just say, if you didn't see it last night, turn it off.  I'll count to three.  Okay.  There's a scene where...  That was two.  Yeah, I know, but I knew I was going to warm up and just take a second to get into it.  I actually gave them five.  Probably a five, yeah.  Desmond comes back, and there's a scene where Desmond and Widmore...  I love the fucking Flash sideways stuff.  I love it.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, because what would happen if their flight had landed?  It's like a whole thing.  But then Desmond and Widmore are in the thing, and there's a call back to season two, I think, 
[00:41:00]  where they had the scotch, the 60-year-old scotch.  Yes.  Where he had said, you're not good enough for this, you can't have it.  And then they would show it periodically, and it represented something.  So in this one, he goes, wait, but that's your 60-year-old scotch.  And he goes, yes, but nothing's too good for you.  It was just so handed over.  It's like, just show me the bottle.  I've watched the series.  I understand what that represents.  Don't fucking spoon-feed it to me.  It was fucking...  The writing this year has been so goddamn god-awful.  Yeah.  Whoever's writing this stuff on the island should be fucking shot. 
[00:41:30]  And the stuff outside the island, the dialogue, is just very cheesy and basic and childlike.  Yeah.  Don't flip that switch.  Really?  What are you doing?  No!  Ah.  I get it.  Go in there and look at the coil.  So we can just burn you.  And it's just two giant magnet coils.  Yeah.  What, do they fucking have no money left this year for effects or anything?  I don't know, for props or anything.  There's a guy zapping in a big coil. 
[00:42:00]  It's like two big fucking donuts he's standing between.  That was retarded.  Big microwave oven.  What is that?  I don't know.  Well, but, you know, I'm pretty much invested, so I'll watch it till the end.  I'll watch now, but I've never seen a show shit the bed so badly.  Yeah.  You only got five episodes left before your Don't Stop Believing moment.  Before the big finale.  Enjoy.  I already, unfortunately, know how it ends, which annoys me that I know.  I wish I didn't know, but I do.  Oh.  Well, why don't you fill us in? 
[00:42:30]  Because I don't care.  Go ahead.  What happens?  They all realize that they're on the island.  Because they're supposed to build a giant retail facility, and they do.  What do they sell?  Office chairs.  The whole thing is for office chairs.  Is it like an office depot or like a Costco or?  Just office chairs?  Only office chairs.  Just office chairs?  On an island.  Island office chairs?  Like a home depot or anything?  Yes.  Or a Trader Joe's?  That's why it zips around through time.  A Target?  It's selling various. 
[00:43:00]  People always need to sit.  It's the motto of the story.  Jesus.  The end.  It's fucking awful.  All right.  Ben does a wheelie with the island.  They jump over a bunch of trucks.  It's stupid.  I had to flip back and forth.  I was going to DVR loss, but I kind of wanted to watch, so I was flipping back and forth from  the Yankee game.  You mean the five-hour Yankee game?  Yeah.  Baseball is fucking itself.  You know what?  You can't have a five-hour game three fucking games into the season. 
[00:43:30]  Let me tell you something.  The early innings were lasting a while.  A while?  Yeah, yeah.  There was a lot of pitches thrown.  You know, because they were loading up the bases.  The Yankees would load up the bases, and then the pitcher is like fucking just blowing  his arm out throwing pitches.  It was taking quite a while.  But I'll tell you something they are doing this season that I haven't seen yet.  But you know this whole, and Jeter is great for this one, putting a hand up in the back 
[00:44:00]  like, hey, time, time.  And then you kick the dirt a little bit.  The fucking up.  Rub your cock a bit.  Here's what the play dump is doing now.  Not even acknowledging the motherfuckers.  He's staring at the pitcher going through, just throwing the fucking ball.  They're not letting people take time.  So they are trying to speed up the game.  They're speeding it up.  Well, it is, though.  It was a five-hour game, I think, last night.  It had nothing to do with delays like that.  Posada would come running out to talk to the pitcher?  No.  Get your ass fucking back here and play the goddamn game.  What do you mean, no?  You can't tell the manager he can't run out to say... 
[00:44:30]  Not the manager, but like the catcher.  I mean the catcher.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Apparently you can now.  The umps are now saying, no, get the fuck back here and play the goddamn game.  I'm not taking your delays anymore.  But baseball is still really hot.  But this is going to come to a head eventually.  We live in a different world.  People don't want to sit through a five-hour fucking baseball game.  I don't mind.  If it's the World Series, I don't mind.  Don't forget, most people don't get up when we do either.  Most people get up a little later.  So for them, it's like they'll watch most of it.  Yeah, but what are you doing? 
[00:45:00]  And you know what baseball is...  But what are you doing?  You're like, you got a laptop on your fucking lap.  Exactly.  Baseball is the kind of game where you can watch it, and you don't have to pay attention  to every second of it.  If it's on, and you hear like, whoa, you know to look up, and I'm going to catch something.  I'm a huge fan.  And I don't know if they do it with baseball, just because I'm not a huge baseball fan these  days.  But I'm going to try to get into the Mets a little bit more than I have in past years.  But some of these sports channels, they'll do like, well, I'm a hockey fan. 
[00:45:30]  The Islanders in an hour.  Yeah.  So they have the whole game in an hour.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is the greatest fucking thing.  All they're doing is really cutting out the stoppage of play, the commercial breaks and  all that.  And you get to see almost the entire game within an hour.  Or like basketball, they do the Knicks in an hour, and they'll just, they'll blow off  a whole bunch of plays that didn't mean shit.  You know what, though?  And just get to the meat and potatoes of the game.  I love that.  There's a dynamic to baseball that there isn't to a game like basketball, which is why, and  I've said it a thousand times, I hate basketball because it's nothing but dunk, dunk, dunk, 
[00:46:00]  score, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk,  and the last person to score wins the fucking game.  I mean, I don't like that at all.  Now, baseball, you could say, yeah, five hours is ridiculous for a game.  It is.  It's too long.  But the lulls that you get in baseball, you'll sit there and be like, all right.  But then the high points, you know, base is fucking loaded.  Here we go.  You know, now we're going to get some action. 
[00:46:30]  There's a dynamic to the game that makes it very exciting.  It depends where you are, too, because if you're like on a beach and someone has the  dumb, I'm going to date myself like a transistor radio, and they got a game on, and you're  kind of close to that person, just kind of listening, and it's just like, and Tom Silver  would be one, two, three, four, and they're just, it's just a lazy day, and you got the  baseball game going on in the background.  That's kind of cool.  But when you're at your house, just, I don't know. 
[00:47:00]  Stay tuned, it's next for our Negro League game.  It's 100 years old.  I mean, baseball ain't going anywhere.  You're right, because you can't just leave it on in the background.  It's been five hours, though.  We're only three games into the season, Anthony.  Come on.  I know.  Last night was good, though.  I got something for you, though.  And Jabba Chamberlain, they know how to use him.  Three outs.  That's how you use Jabba.  Let him get three outs, walk off the field like he won the fucking World Series, fucking  pumping his fists everywhere like the lunatic he is. 
[00:47:30]  And, yeah, he'll do a good job for you.  I have something for you, though.  Yeah.  Swung on it.  High in the air to deep right.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone!  Uh-oh.  Robbie Cano drills one deep in the right field seats.  A long home run down the right field line.  It's Robbie Cano.  Don't you know?  And the Yankees on the home run take a 6-4 lead.  It's not about you! 
[00:48:00]  It's Robbie Cano.  Who don't you know?  Who don't you know?  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  Do we have an update on Bobo?  Is he going to blow that dog dick to get back on the show?  We do have an update on Bobo.  All right.  We'll do it after the break because Bobo wants back on the show so bad.  And we said, all right, you fucking blow a dog.  We'll let you back on the show.  So I want to see where we're at with that.  But the grand master fucking guy from the Yankees. 
[00:48:30]  What was his name?  Granderson.  Granderson.  Yes.  Gunderson?  A lot of people tweeted that that home run call that that douche made is based on some  kind of 1945 musical on Broadway or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He actually pulled that out of his asshole.  It's not about you, Sterling.  You think he was proud about that?  Some obscure reference that only a few douchebags would get?  I really hope Granderson does hit a bases loaded home run because you know what's coming 
[00:49:00]  on that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  A Granderson slam.  Exactly.  It'll be the douchiest moment.  Grand Slamerson.  You know what?  You're probably right.  Just something douchey.  Who the fuck enjoys?  I don't understand how he does it.  Everyone has to write the Yankee organization and tell him, it's shit.  Yeah.  It's not about you.  We live in a different world than everybody else. 
[00:49:30]  Holy fuck.  I watch the local media and they think it's hilarious.  They love it.  They couldn't.  They're laughing at him.  I know.  They're laughing at him.  Maybe when the cameras are off, but they kind of embrace the John Sterling home run call.  Fucking terrible.  In New York for some reason.  You know what else I really enjoy about baseball these days is the visual experience on television.  The camera angles now are amazing.  HD, any game, football, fucking baseball, hockey in HD is, you wonder how you ever watched 
[00:50:00]  it on that fucking little screen.  I love hockey in HD.  It's like a square fucking CRT screen.  And when the game's not on HD, I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.  I can't watch it the regular way anyway.  Game not on HD?  Where does that happen?  Right.  I have the Yes Network.  Yeah.  My God.  You watch it on HD.  And then they got like overhead views and fucking camera angles that they just never fucking 
[00:50:30]  had before.  You watch slow motion where you can see the fucking stitching on the ball.  That's pretty cool.  Where it used to be a blurry streak where they tried to freeze frame it years ago.  Right.  And now you just see the stitching on the ball.  Slow motion.  You watch exactly how someone might have gotten too far in front of the ball and shit.  It just, that stuff I think is fantastic to watch on TV.  I'm going to be a baseball fan this year.  It's, it's, I, I just, I enjoy the game.  I still haven't been to the new POC.  Yeah.  Where the Mets play. 
[00:51:00]  Fucking great.  You been there?  No, oh, Citi Field.  No, no, I've been to the stadium.  I want to be, I want to go to Citi Field.  It's bad.  It's pretty cool.  I mean, if you remember when you go to that.  Of course I do.  It's just mind-bogglingly different.  Do you still have to duck when the jets go by?  Yeah, there's a lot of air traffic going over.  How many times have you ducked over the years?  It's funny, because when I was at, when I was at opening day the other day, I, I, I said,  you know what, I should be counting how many planes, because this has to be like the 20th  one.  And it's like barely the fourth inning.  People are just, people, I was going to say the people that came before us are stupid, 
[00:51:30]  but I think people are just stupid.  But why would you build a park and, and right where the fucking jets are coming in?  Yeah.  Why couldn't they have moved it like, what, a quarter mile would take care of the problem?  A little bit somewhere, come on.  And there's nothing but open fields over there.  Yeah.  It's just, just, there's nothing else around there.  It's just part of the allure.  It's part of the allure of the stadium.  And going to see the Mets is seeing the fucking rivets on the belly of an airplane scraping  over your head.  You're ducking. 
[00:52:00]  You really are.  They got to pull the gear up.  That's why the game is five or six hours, because they stop play.  Yeah, sometimes, sometimes during like the playoffs, they do, they actually divert the  traffic.  They divert the traffic from the stadium.  Well, that's a horrific airport.  Anyway, how they bank into LaGuardia.  I, it's a little short runway.  I'm done with that.  I don't go there.  So I don't fly in or out of there unless I'm desperate.  Like people haven't crashed to Kennedy.  Kennedy's got some of the longest runways.  I'm going to go, uh, smash into those.  I'm going to go way local. 
[00:52:30]  But when you're on that LIE and you see those, you're convinced every plane you see in the  sky is crashing because all of a sudden it's banking like hard left or hard right, depending  on the direction you're going.  Or the like left rack city.  Like hard, but a hard left.  Well, even like, uh, on the Whitestone Expressway, I know this is local, but on the Whitestone  Expressway, cause like now you're, you're, you're hitting the plane, uh, like T-boning  it.  And I could say, I mean, I could swear you could see faces in the window.  Oh, you could see faces in the fucking window.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  The best, the best city to fly into is Vegas.  It is just a straight line for hundreds and hundreds of miles. 
[00:53:00]  They don't turn the plane.  Like you never turn.  There's twists and turns till the second your wheels hit the ground because you got to fit  into the pattern of three major fucking airports in one spot.  It's a rollercoaster ride.  What about when you're flying to JFK?  Vegas is just like, Hey, we're, um, we're on final.  We're 800 miles out.  Just a straight line, man.  Just a slow descent straight line.  Yeah.  Fucking JFK.  All of a sudden you see the airport to your left.  You're like, okay, good. 
[00:53:30]  And then they fly all the way out into the ocean.  Now they're a hundred feet off the ocean as they decide to make their bank turn.  A huge turn.  To come back into the airport.  To skim in the water with the wingtips.  What the fuck, man?  Yeah.  Never got that one.  All right.  We're battling.  Let's take a break.  Uh, Continental charging $80 for a fucking, uh, exit row seat or something.  That's a new one.  Is it 80?  I know they're charging non-elite members.  I know we moved on from the airline thing, but.  It's just, it's another way these piece of shit airlines can fuck you. 
[00:54:00]  They are, they're really despicable.  Well.  Another way they can fuck you.  And we, the people, just take it.  That's what frustrates me.  I, I, I just need to know how we could, like, organize so we don't have to take it anymore.  I know.  We're not gonna take it.  We just take it.  Cause what?  We have no other option, right?  Don't fly the airline to do it.  I mean, again, they all kind of do it, though.  They're all gonna do it, though.  Once one does it and they realize people aren't going away, uh, they're all gonna hop on board.  They've done it with the fucking, uh, the baggage. 
[00:54:30]  With the checked baggage.  And now we pay.  Oh, what is that?  50 bucks?  Here you go.  Here you go.  I gotta fucking pay.  You gotta pull cash out.  Like, you're taking a bus.  What are we looking at?  Yeah, why are we looking at this?  It's like somebody, they're taking off from, what, LaGuardia?  That's somebody landing.  Yeah, it's just LaGuardia landing.  I've done a few videos of takeoff and landings.  It's just kind of fun.  You never know what's gonna happen, either.  You could have that gold, that fucking golden video of something falling off or shit like that.  That's if they find your fucking iPhone. 
[00:55:00]  Exactly.  One piece in the firing package.  Well, you're gonna be dead anyway, so, uh, if, if you don't die, then you got some, like, really good footage.  How scary is it looking out that window when this plane is landing?  Oh, you know what it is?  It's because it's water, water, water, water, and then the second your wheels hit is when you see runway.  Yeah, for the rest of the country, that's right.  I forgot about that.  LaGuardia, you're convinced you're landing in the water, and the last second you kind of see the runway.  You know what else is like that?  San Francisco.  Really?  When you're coming in, yeah, it looks like you're about to just touch down on water.  And then a big cock goes in your ass.  Yeah, then you go, oh, okay, that was... 
[00:55:30]  It's a gay city.  Yeah, so then you're like, I'm not flying, I'm just watching a movie about planes while being ass-fucked.  Yeah, it's sad that San Francisco gets that reputation, because that is a fucking beautiful city, man.  Yeah.  You need all the ass-fucked.  It is a beautiful fucking city.  And that's all anyone thinks is gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.  Of course.  It's an amazing place.  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to refute you.  It's an amazing place.  Yeah, Pelosi's fucking there.  It's not that amazing to me.  Is she 70 fucking years old?  She's 70. 
[00:56:00]  She's an old lady.  She is, with a big stupid gavel.  Put that up, you pussy.  Shut up.  I hate her.  It's a great place for a gavel.  Yeah, well, she's 70.  You think anyone has ever taken the gavel up the poop chute over the years?  Yeah, she's taken the handle.  Eh, maybe Tip O'Neill.  I was going to go with Tip O'Neill myself.  Tip O'Neill on a drunken bender.  Was he a drunk?  Oh, yeah.  Was he?  He was known for tipping some beers back.  He actually did some guest spots on Cheers.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  I'll ask Ted about that.  Oh, yeah?  Ted who?  Oh, right.  Ted.  Ted Danson.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy's working with Ted Danson.  I want Ted Danson's plane.  All right.  I'll ask him about it.  And we work with Bob Kelly.  Teddy.  So what's your point?  Teddy.  I call him Teddy.  No, you don't.  No, I know.  Stop.  Oh, the Calm Tree video is up on my YouTube channel, Opio Radio.  It came out pretty good.  Bob Kelly puking yesterday because of the blossoming trees that smell like fucking cum.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Video turned out very, very well.  And yes, I know I spelled jizz wrong.  I fucked up.  Ask Ted to smell his finger.  See if it smells like.  No.  Oh.  Would that be.  I'm not saying anything.  I just said.  Mer.  It's all.  Mer.  I'm not saying anything.  Mer.  Mer.  Mer.  Mer.  Mer.  I have to say, watching him in a reed, the guy is fucking unbelievable.  Every line is good.  Really?  Wow.  Every line is good.  Even like non-funny, just like regular lines. 
[00:57:30]  Just effortless?  Yeah.  Even just regular.  Every line looks like, oh, this guy just sat down and was really talking.  Like conversation.  How do people do that?  I want to stand up sometimes in the middle of it and go, Jesus, you are fucking good at  this.  How do people do that?  I don't know.  But meanwhile, I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was very weird.  I was just looking at Jimmy on that, and he's wearing the same sweatshirt.  And he's talking.  And he's talking.  And I thought there was a live camera.  But it's Bobby hates the jizz trees of New York City.  Well, I spelled jizz wrong. 
[00:58:00]  And of course, all the dopes have to point it out over and over again.  Oh, the gizz trees?  Yeah.  Do you guys notice I lost a little bit of weight?  No.  I don't like the fact that nobody's pointing that out with exclamation points.  Fuckers.  Why is E-Rack stretching in the background?  Is he trying to show off his new body or something?  New body.  What's going on there?  And then he disappears.  Then he's yawning.  I love how E-Rack just disappears.  I wish that would happen in real life.  Oh, no.  Here's Bobby walking in.  Hi, sweetie.  What's up?  You doing LA?  With the jizz tree leaves stuck in his microphone cover. 
[00:58:30]  And wait.  Hold on.  Pause that.  You know what?  I am an LA guy.  We set up the whole video saying, okay, make sure he sits fucking down.  And the first thing Bobby does is go, fucking, I'm not sitting down.  I'm going to stand.  He stands up.  Because we had a hidden camera.  Yeah.  Well, I almost missed the fucking shot.  I have it on mine, too.  Well, I'll take it off the computer.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  Well, I could have used that.  I could have, like, maybe spliced two cameras, shoot.  Spliced your footage into my footage.  So, yeah, the mic cover, the little windscreen thing is foam ball, and it's just packed with these fucking leaves. 
[00:59:00]  That smell like cum.  And they make him sick.  So, uh, he had to smell them.  That smell like giz trees.  Giz trees, yes.  Look, I was trying to get the video off quickly.  Quit smoking.  I woke up every day.  Ran up a canyon.  You run up canyons?  It's the fucking jizz trees in New York, you cunts. 
[00:59:30]  You smell them?  Is there a fucking attack in New York, Anthony?  Welcome home, Bobby.  Welcome home, Bobby.  I hate the fucking smell. 
[01:00:00]  I think I was molested.  I think I was molested.  He smelled it again.  Bob Rolston.  The sound of Bob puking is just classic.  You see how red his head gets?  What are you talking about cum trees in New York?  Dude, those jizz trees in New York City, they do smell like cum.  They smell like fuck.  Smell that, dude.  Have you smelled them?  We all smelled it, Bobby.  It smells like a fucking someone, like nine guys just danked on your cheek. 
[01:00:30]  I can't fucking take it.  The whole neighborhood.  It stinks.  It smells like fucking jizz all the time.  It's fucking terrible, dude.  I can't take it.  Yeah, you don't like that.  I don't like what?  Jizzy smell?  No.  No, I don't.  Do you?  Do you?  Yeah, you can check out the video.  That's a good one.  It's up there.  It was great to watch because we knew it was going to get to him.  Yeah.  Because he quit smoking, so his sense of smell has obviously improved.  And just to watch him, it hit him so fast. 
[01:01:00]  He must have just paused and then breathed in.  He did, because as he's talking, I'm like, why isn't he getting it?  But you realize he's talking, so he's not breathing in.  He's exhaling.  Right.  And then he stopped for a second and inhaled, and that was it.  It was over.  Why don't we take a break?  Let's not forget Ian Halpern coming in.  Not coming in.  Totally good.  On the phone.  Better be.  Yeah, I mean, Sandra Bullock had a break of silence to deny Ian Halpern's claim she had a sex tape,  so we'll get Ian on to get his side of the story.  That should be pretty huge for us today, if he fucking doesn't blow us off. 
[01:01:30]  And then Tom Papa coming back.  Yeah, he's doing, I think, the Stress Factory.  I want to say this weekend, but I could be wrong.  Very funny comedian.  He's a great comic.  Yeah, he's a great comic, this Tom Papa.  I heard the marriage ref got picked up for season two.  Well, congratulations.  That's good news for Tom Papa, huh?  Oh, he's happy for my friends when I can't get anything to fucking last for more than three weeks.  Why aren't you on the show?  Honestly, the guests they've had have been Madonna.  They've also had some lame fucking guests.  You know, Eva Langoria.  They're all famous, though.  So?  I've seen Tom.  How about you get someone that, you're famous, first of all,  and second of all, you've got a much better sense of humor 
[01:02:00]  than a few of those people they've had on there.  Let's mention that to Tom.  I've seen Tom on, he was in The Informant.  Yeah.  He was in the movie The Informant.  Who was it?  Matt Damon.  That was Matt Damon's movie.  Oh, I didn't see that.  Was that a good movie?  Yeah, you know something?  I liked it.  I thought it was kind of funny.  Weird.  Yeah, I liked it.  And he had a scene with De Niro, too.  Are we doing Bob Kelly and the Butt thing?  Yeah.  All right, we're doing Bob Kelly and the Butt thing and some other things, 
[01:02:30]  and then we come back.  Got to tell you what Bloomberg's doing in the city.  It's not going to make Jimmy happy.  Wilding.  And then that Hank Johnson audio that you were telling me about.  Yes.  I'm a little out on that, but Ant filled me in on it.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  We got Ian Halpern calling in at 8 o'clock.  Do we?  He's all over the gossip pages today because he pretty much is saying there's a Sandra Bullock 
[01:03:00]  sex tape, and he was the one that got Sandra Bullock to come out of hiding to say there's  no fucking sex tape.  She's really pissed at Ian Halpern.  Who isn't?  We'll get Ian Halpern's side of the story at 8 o'clock.  Alert the media.  This could be good.  Alert the media.  What else?  Tom Papa at 8.30 or 8.15, somewhere around there.  Yeah.  He's doing that marriage ref show.  And he's a really, really funny stand-up comedian playing Vinny's Club in New Brunswick, 
[01:03:30]  New Jersey, The Stress Factory, right?  Is it tomorrow or is it Saturday?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We'll find out.  We'll find all that out.  Where's that bum?  That bum.  Tiger Woods tees off tomorrow, 142.  That's one of the headlines today, huh?  Hey, Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy announced they're splitting, and they did it on Twitter.  Splitsville, Opie.  It's Splitsville for them, I like to say.  They were just on Oprah about a year ago.  See how in love they were and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:04:00]  I wonder what went wrong.  You know what the oddest thing about it is, is they decided to announce that they broke  up on Twitter.  Like first, Jim Carrey announced it.  Very civil, very kind of nice, you know, saying, oh, we had some nice years together and everything  like that.  And then moments later, I guess, she tweeted about it and pretty much said the same thing  and that they're committed to their daughter that they've had together.  But it's kind of odd now that I guess celebrities want to just get in front of things and own 
[01:04:30]  them.  The news picks it up and twists it around in their words.  It's kind of smart because it's coming right from the proverbial horse's mouth.  It's coming from the source.  It's really, really smart because the media, we've all been victims of the dumb media and  how they twist things.  So it's good to cut out the middleman and go, no, this is what's happening.  I'm saying it right here.  Yeah, here's my statement.  On my Twitter.  It can't be edited.  It can't be twisted around because you wrote it yourself. 
[01:05:00]  Correct.  So, you know, because even if you tell your story to the paper or the network news or  something, they edit it and twist it around and add their own shit to it.  Yep.  So that way you get in front of the story and own it.  And that's that.  So, ah, whatever.  So they're breaking up.  Ashton Kutcher, right?  Is he the biggest tweet guy?  I don't know anymore.  I know he was when it first kicked over.  I fucking hate him.  His tweets are horrible. 
[01:05:30]  Bobo has better tweets.  And I know there's a lot of haters out there that don't like the Bobo.  But Bobo has better tweets than the number one tweeter, Ashton Kutcher.  Are his two safe?  Oh, they're horrendous.  Can we get his Twitter?  I don't even.  Why would anyone follow him on Twitter?  I don't get it.  A lot of people do.  Four million or something.  Mayer's got like three million, though.  He's got a massive amount.  Now, John Mayer, I followed for a little while and his tweets are okay.  But he plays it safe, too.  Yeah.  This Kutcher, though, why don't you read a few of these tweets?  And how many followers? 
[01:06:00]  He's got almost five million.  God damn.  He's pushing five million.  Four and three quarter million.  And this is what you get if you follow Ashton Kutcher.  What do you get?  Waiting for consensus is a fast track to mediocrity.  That's like a word of wisdom.  Yeah.  Well, he does a little word of wisdom.  By the way, I despise words of wisdom, especially from rappers.  You know?  Keep your mind on your money, but your money by your mind.  Shut up.  Shut it.  I'm trying to fucking enlighten me. 
[01:06:30]  Put your gun away.  Oh, my God.  Assholes.  You weren't here when I started that whole thing.  What did I call it?  Positive fucking quotes or whatever.  That suck.  I despise positive quotes.  Motivational.  What the fuck did I call it?  I started a whole thing.  Inspirational.  Inspirational quotes that suck.  Yep.  Pretty much all of them suck.  What's this one?  They mean nothing.  Do stoplights really have sensors to detect if a car is there, or have I been nudging my  car forward for all these years for nothing? 
[01:07:00]  And that was Ashton.  Wow.  That's...  Oh, wow.  I got to follow this guy, man.  That's amazing.  Well, let's not forget that before he rose to fame and fortune, he used to sweep up Cheerio  dust at the cereal factory.  Oh.  Well, we all had shitty jobs, Danny.  I can tell you about the time I had a retard as my boss when I was washing dishes at a restaurant,  so...  He didn't write that, did he?  What, the stoplight thing?  No, Cheerio dust.  No, he used to...  No, they did do that?  Yeah, it was Ruffin.  Oh, that was his actual job before he made it. 
[01:07:30]  So...  We got to squeeze those big fucking Demi Moore fake melons.  Not so big.  Did she have them taken out?  Not so big.  She took something out.  She took something out.  All right, whatever.  So he's one of the top tweet guys.  He's got me number one.  Four million, seven hundred...  I don't even understand why, because they're shitty tweets.  Shitty tweets.  Our listeners have better tweets than that crap.  All right, Dan, why don't we move on?  People want to be part of it. 
[01:08:00]  What are we going to do?  15 minutes on Ashton Kutcher and how much he sucks on Twitter?  Of course not.  We wouldn't do that.  No!  You want the mayor of New York City?  This joke?  No.  Oh, you mean the audio?  So, you know, we had wilding going on in Times Square, and it was a pretty out-of-control  scene, Easter Sunday.  Apparently, this was happening a few places around the country.  Orlando also had this Easter wilding thing that goes on.  Can we remember?  Can we be the ones that warn everyone that you could get shot on Easter Sunday as you're 
[01:08:30]  minding your own business, going around town with your family?  I'll remember.  There's no other politician or media outlet fucking warned anybody, and they knew this  was going on.  We didn't know, but now we will remember for next time.  Yeah, they said the police were prepared for this, and they knew it was going to happen.  Well, everybody...  How about preparing the fucking...  The people...  Yeah, like I said yesterday, there's like a 90% chance of lead in the air on Easter Sunday. 
[01:09:00]  And how about the police maybe tell the tourists, who were horrified and running for their lives,  what's going on before it, like, happens?  Yeah, but you saw the paper.  It was all in fun.  Look at the tweets from the guys.  Oh, yeah, their tweets are...  You want to read some of the tweets from the guys?  Oh, Wolfie, do I ever?  Because there's a thing going on where...  Do I ever?  See, we tweet fun, silly stuff, and, well, you know, some of the youths out there are tweeting,  let's get together and fucking bash some heads. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, these aren't Ashton Kutcher tweets here.  Apparently, the prosecutor here in New York says no deals are going to be cut.  Everybody that's arrested is going to be prosecuted.  They can't have this kind of thing happen without consequences.  Right.  But before, during, and after this melee was going on in Times Square where...  Just to refresh everyone's memory, just because we're talking to the whole country, 
[01:10:00]  we had a car show here Easter Sunday at the Javits Center, big convention center,  and that's a, what do they call it, a gang magnet?  Gang magnet.  Or gang activity magnet, and then the car show ends,  and now you've got thousands of people leaving, and all hell broke loose.  Yeah.  Is it safe to say all hell broke loose for a little while?  All hell broke loose.  It's young black men is pretty much what this is.  Not pretty much.  It is what this is.  A giant group of young black men swoop down on Times Square and just fuck it up with vandalism, 
[01:10:30]  assault, and gunfire.  Just after Disney, put all this money in, and they do all this work to make it nice and  consumer friendly and bring in tourists, and these fucking animals go down there and  just fuck it up.  Yeah, and just fuck it up for no reason.  There's, there's, I don't know what to make of this.  I was telling Opie earlier, before the show started, I don't understand black people. 
[01:11:00]  I just don't understand them.  Well, that was-  I can't understand how you do this.  But, see, you say that, and then you got all your haters that think you're a racist  going to yell and scream.  Well, fuck, I'm a racist.  But you should explain why you said it this morning.  But you should explain why you said it this morning, because of the dude in Newark that  just was released from prison.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Sharp James.  Sharp James.  You know anything about this Sharp James, Jimmy?  Well, Mayor of Newark.  Mayor of Newark, Sharp James.  He's been in prison since 08 or something like that. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, a couple of years he's been in prison because-  We're in trouble for a couple of years.  I don't know how much time he actually did.  There was all kinds of corruption and deal-making, and apparently his girlfriend or mistress  was given money, and he was getting kickbacks, real estate deals.  All kinds of shenanigans were going on with this Sharp James.  And they prosecuted him, and he went to jail for a couple of years.  Well, he got out yesterday, and he pulled up on a bus into Newark to a hero's welcome. 
[01:12:00]  Of course.  From only black people.  Like an astronaut was returning.  Black people were cheering this guy on, saying it is so good to have him back in Newark.  In the community.  In the community, yes, yes.  That's the catchphrase, the word.  The community, wherever that is, wherever those borders are.  The great things he did for the community.  Stuffing his pockets with fucking loads of cash through corruption. 
[01:12:30]  Is that it?  Why do black people never want to see black politicians get in trouble?  Yeah.  Mary and Barry.  Like, why do they never go, you know what, this guy smoked crack with a hooker?  Yeah.  Fair enough, I understand it.  But not when you're the fucking mayor!  Yeah.  And that's why Ant goes, I don't understand black people.  I go, I don't.  Which puts it in a bit of perspective there, because although they did have one black woman  they did find that said, holy shit, what the fuck is going on here?  This is crazy.  They interviewed a bunch of white people who were just, like, you know, amazed that this 
[01:13:00]  was happening, and then one black woman who said he should still be in prison.  Right.  And the rest were just a bunch of black people praising him.  Signs of support.  Like a rock star getting off of this fucking bus.  They had signs, you know, mayor.  Oh, yeah.  Like he should run again.  He should run again.  And you know what?  He probably would win.  Political signs.  He'd probably win, just like Mary and Barry.  That fucking guy smoked crack.  Hey, we had Mary and Barry on this show.  He rules.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he certainly does.  He fucking rules.  He goes, no one knows what was in that pipe. 
[01:13:30]  Wasn't that his quote?  No one knows what was in that pipe.  It's like, but they caught you.  They have film of you smoking crack in a pipe.  No one knows what was in that pipe.  It's the I didn't do nothing defense.  One of the best quotes ever on our show, though.  He shut us all up.  I didn't do nothing.  He kind of shut us all up.  He goes, no one knows what was in that pipe.  All right.  I was watching videos last night.  Um, there's, uh, God, there's a site.  It's some, some black gangster guy down in Florida, and he's got a bunch of videos online 
[01:14:00]  of, uh, people partying, apparently.  It's just them partying at various events.  One of them was Easter on in Orlando, where he, um, was criticizing the police for ruining  their good time.  Well, apparently, gunfire to the police, um, isn't a good time.  So they show a bunch of cops with their guns out, converging on somebody that had a gun.  Uh, and, and then just a crowd of black youth running up the street. 
[01:14:30]  And this guy on camera going, why they gotta treat our people like this?  Blowing whistles like we're animals.  The slave days are over.  We're not livestock.  We're not.  All right.  And then the second something happens, if the cops aren't there, where's the police protection  in our community?  It just, there's, there's no satisfying people that cannot think rationally.  And when I see videos like that, it, it just, it annoys the living shit out of me because  white people can do nothing right. 
[01:15:00]  The police can do nothing right.  Uh, politicians, unless they're, you know, Marion Barry and Sharp James can do nothing  right.  It's just, it's beyond me.  And I don't understand it.  I watch it.  I, I try, but I can't understand the lifestyle, the discussions that they're having on some  of these videos, the gang signs being thrown up and the, the, the, the lingo, I just don't  get it.  Well, and we, and we come back to this past Sunday where it was, it was quite a scene in 
[01:15:30]  Times Square because it's the day it's becoming the day where what?  It's a tradition.  It's a tradition that gangs get together and cause a bit of havoc.  It's kind of gang initiation day and informal gang initiation day.  So they decided to go to Times Square where one gentleman said, well, that's where, that's  where the girls is.  Is that a tweet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's well, that was a comment of his as to why they go down there because that's where 
[01:16:00]  the girls is.  Not really.  Times Square.  Not really.  It's, it's more family.  And it would be the same thing with white people, with white people.  What, I just want to see what that guy's point is in writing before we, where am I  going down?  The second line too.  Oh, okay.  Uh, if white people, if it was Clinton or some other white guy, and would it be the same  thing with white people?  No, it wouldn't be.  There, there wouldn't be like Bill Clinton when he, um, why do he doesn't get motivated 
[01:16:30]  enough to kind of like rally?  Cause some white politician got out of jail.  They just don't do it.  And Clinton was a thing.  It wasn't a, he didn't go to jail.  It wasn't a crime, he fucked somebody.  It was funny.  But name one, name one white politician that went away for some.  Oh, there's been, there's been plenty, but they're not hailed as heroes when they get  out.  That's what I'm saying.  When they got, I mean, name one where he was hailed as a hero.  Cause that's how you have to play this.  I'm trying to think.  Exactly.  It doesn't happen.  I can't think of one.  And Clinton wasn't stealing and shoving money in his pockets. 
[01:17:00]  He was getting blown.  Yeah.  But it wasn't a corruption thing.  Good for him, I say.  Of course.  Fuck it.  You can respect the guy getting a blowjob from a big fat pig.  Can't.  All right.  Uh, yeah.  So, uh, in Times Square, they were, went from the Javits Center to the, to Times Square.  Tourists were horrified.  Um, and then some of the tweets that went out before, during, and after.  Mm-hmm.  Um, shout out to G-M-B-B-M-G-O-Y-G. 
[01:17:30]  Uh, those are various gangs, I guess.  Is that like an O-B-G-Y-N?  Yeah, yeah.  They're shouting out to an obstetrician and gynecologist.  Just, maybe, maybe, maybe there's a gyno convention in town.  Yeah.  Yo, shout out to my ENT for the sinus surgery.  Yeah.  Shout out to G-M-B-B-M-G-O-Y-G.  Niggas was live on 42nd.  Well, then.  Yes, I imagine that was what they said when they, they, uh, they exited a respectful 
[01:18:00]  showing of the Lion King.  Uh, yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, apparently O-Y-G stands for Original Young Gangsters, and G-M-B stands for Get Money Boys.  Those are gangs.  Yeah.  Why can't anybody just fucking Twitter something nice?  Well.  You know, the L, the LBs, the library boys.  Yeah, what, what, how about, how about the BRMFs, the book reading motherfuckers?  Why not? 
[01:18:30]  Uh, here's another one.  I guess this was afterwards.  Free all the gangsters.  Especially my man Mars, who got scooped, who got scooped tonight.  My man Mars, who got scooped.  I didn't know Mars was out there.  No, explain to that one.  You got scooped?  Mars got scooped.  Damn, Mars.  He got scooped.  How did he get out?  My man Mars is starting an electrical fire, because the motherfucking don't know what he's  doing.  Oh, damn, yo.  That's cold.  Um, went mobbing on 42. 
[01:19:00]  What you doing today?  They went mobbing.  Well, I.  It's apparently what they call wilding now, is mobbing.  I did a little Easter egg hunt with the, with the, the kids.  That's what I was doing.  Were you Easter egg hunting?  And he went mobbing.  He was mobbing.  And I was like, hey, find the plastic eggs.  There's, uh.  They look for them.  They're, they're, they're white eggs, and they're on shoulders.  Dumb tourists.  There's, uh, a few more.  What?  What?  What?  A couple more of those tweets that I saw.  What?  In the butt? 
[01:19:30]  What?  What?  What?  In the butt?  What?  What?  Meanwhile, Tiger's in trouble for his text.  And this fucking idiocy goes pretty much unnoticed.  It, it, it just.  And it's like I said.  We're going to tell you what Bloomberg's up to.  The mayor of this city where this all went down on Sunday.  Well, where are the black activists to condemn this?  Where is Reverend Al Sharpton to condemn the behavior of his, uh, uh, youth?  Has he?  His constituency's youth.  Has he peeped up at all?  No, not a word out of that motherfucker.  Not even a word. 
[01:20:00]  How about you, you concentrate on things that make a, uh, a real impact.  Not even a word.  People shooting, uh, each other.  Uh, this kind of behavior.  But nothing.  There's no meeting.  There's no outrage.  There's no press conference.  Unless Don Imus is saying nappy-headed hoe, which does nothing.  Yep.  Uh, there's people being shot.  There's people being assaulted.  Uh, but, you know, where, where, where is it?  And where's that?  Where's Jesse Jackson?  Those pieces of shit don't go anywhere near when there's a real problem.  Why aren't they down there knowing this is going to happen? 
[01:20:30]  You know, if, if the cops knew it, Sharpton and Jackson know it.  Of course.  But yeah, exactly.  Worry about Imus.  Fucking phonies.  And the mayor.  We got what the mayor's up to.  Uh, I'm going to play this in a few seconds here, but Dan's trying to find more tweets.  Yeah, this one.  We, we was on 42 mobbing when they fought the OY niggas.  So I guess that's what they were doing.  Uh, original young gangsters.  Uh, to everybody, everyone that's going to 42nd today, be safe, loves. 
[01:21:00]  Be safe.  How about you, you don't go down there and just fucking assault people.  How about that?  Fucking goddamn Swedish tourists running around like crazy.  Oh, can you imagine?  Oh my God, I saw them on the news.  The tourists were like terrified.  Yeah, how about this?  How about you go to fucking Bensonhurst and try that shit?  Yeah, go ahead.  Here you go.  Yeah, run around there.  We'll go to Afghanistan and try that shit.  Go to East New York and, uh, fuck around.  Take a plane to Iraq or something and try that shit. 
[01:21:30]  That's another one.  Yeah, go to Afghanistan.  If you, if you want to be brave.  Put your head cut off.  Uh, well, while that was going on, uh, I don't think Bloomberg has said much because  he's, he's too busy doing this, Anthony, the mayor of New York City.  Before too long, Park Avenue between 42nd and 41st streets will be closed to traffic forever.  It's part of Mayor Bloomberg's plan to build pedestrian malls all over the city.  And just like when cars were outlawed in Times Square and Herald Square, drivers are livid.  It's terrible.  If you do this, it's terrible.  This is crazy. 
[01:22:00]  What we're looking to do is create, you know, some of the green spaces that you see, you know,  in other parts of the city.  You've seen that in Times Square.  You've seen that, uh, at Grand Army Plaza.  We've got beautifully designed materials.  We've got, uh, really elegant tables and chairs.  We've got planters.  And just providing some green space.  Plans for seven other pedestrian malls supported by community groups have also been approved.  Four are located in Brooklyn.  Moving to the Bronx, there is one.  And there are two more in Manhattan.  Applications are being accepted for other pedestrian malls.  And they could end up looking like this one at 12th Street and 9th Avenue. 
[01:22:30]  There you go.  That's what the mayor's up to.  It's a fucking city.  You shouldn't have green spaces.  That's what people, one woman was saying, look, this isn't, Manhattan isn't an amusement park.  It's, it's a place where people work and have to get from point A to point B.  And, uh, there's a lot of business going on here.  What's with, like, pedestrian malls where people can sit down with elegant fucking chairs and tables?  That's where people drive, you dummies.  Make a park out of something.  Knock a building down and make a park if you want to have a sitting place for somebody. 
[01:23:00]  As soon as you go over a bridge or, you know, in a tunnel, there's a lot of green space.  As soon as you get to the other side, you're like, wow, there's a lot of green space.  A lot of green.  I'd like to see the Bronx one.  That's going to be great.  A pedestrian rape area.  Jesus.  That's going to be fucking wonderful.  Jesus.  Pedestrian malls.  Stop.  Fucking sissy mayor.  So annoying.  Wow.  Fucking woman he is.  I think that'll be turned around once he's out of fucking office.  We'll be painting the lines back on the streets.  Well, there's a lot of bike paths and stuff or bike routes in the city now, Manhattan. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  I wouldn't even mind so much because I do bike a lot if people were actually using them.  But no one's using them.  No one uses them?  No.  They got these lanes dedicated to bikes and bikers, whatever, and no one's using them.  A couple people.  Yeah.  Well, I see it on the west side.  This isn't San Francisco.  San Francisco has a huge biking community.  Ridiculous.  Politically active, matter of fact.  Politically strong.  Interestingly enough, no seats on those bikes.  They just...  Poor San Francisco.  I know.  It really isn't.  The train tracks. 
[01:24:00]  It's really a beautiful city and they get that fucking reputation.  Oh, they certainly do.  All the bar stools upside down on the bars.  Exactly.  Fucking stupid trolleys.  Jingle-lingle.  Oh, Rice-a-roni.  I don't know.  It's the San Francisco treat.  Believe me, it's really not.  Right behind ass sex.  You ever have Rice-a-roni?  There's nothing...  Love Rice-a-roni.  I love Rice-a-roni.  It's not one of the greatest treats of all time.  It tastes like Lipton soup, but with rice.  But noodley.  Oh, it's not even noodley. 
[01:24:30]  No, it's Rice-a-roni.  The San Francisco treat.  Rice-a-roni.  The flavor can't be beat.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  It's only the San Francisco treat, Rice-a-roni, if it's thrown on your back.  I should have.  All right.  Hey, this guy might have came up with a white politician that got a hero's welcome after  he got out of jail.  Really?  We go to Brian.  All right.  Or Bryon in Massachusetts.  Right.  It's Brian. 
[01:25:00]  I'm white.  All right.  Yeah, Buddy Cianci, the old mayor of Providence.  This is like something out of Sopranos.  Like, the guy was taking money for like 35 years.  He was like one of these lifetime mayors.  Went to jail for like two years.  Then he went back to Providence.  And he got like an AM radio talk show.  It was like the guy at a casino.  Ace Rothstein's TV show.  Ace.  He was just like talking about the guy.  Ace is high.  And now Ace Rothstein with his show, Ace is high. 
[01:25:30]  Maybe you guys can look up some more details on it.  I don't know.  No, Buddy was, Buddy's a legend up there in Providence.  You know, he was one of these.  Oh, was he?  He was one of these mayors.  He was a bad guy for like 35 years now.  He was a bad mother.  Shut your mouth.  He was a bad guy.  A badass.  Had some nice connections.  Well, all right.  There you go.  You found one.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Fair is fair.  We found one.  I don't know.  From what I see, the African-American community rally behind politicians that have gotten in 
[01:26:00]  trouble strictly because they're black.  I've never seen them rally around a crooked white politician, no matter how good he's been  to their causes.  Could be the most liberal one ever.  I don't just.  There's.  There's such racism.  And yeah, yeah.  They supported Clinton.  But again, Clinton wasn't arrested.  He wasn't jailed.  He wasn't convicted of anything.  Not yet.  Guy who doesn't know politics.  Not yet.  They're still working to impeach him. 
[01:26:30]  Did you see ATM guy?  Not to change his mouth guy.  Well, ATM guy on the news.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  ATM guy rules.  That was the guy that used the.  Down at Soho.  It's an old school thing, but it's an old school robbery.  They love this.  But what?  It's a truck or something.  Was it a truck?  It was some kind of vehicle.  Cadillac.  Was it a Cadillac?  It was just a regular fucking old finned Cadillac.  So did he yank the bumper off his Cadillac?  No, those things were built like brick shithouses.  So this guy, ATM guy down in Soho, he decides he needs some money. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  You know, times are tough.  Gotta make a withdrawal from the ATM.  So God bless this guy.  He fucking.  He attaches a chain to an ATM machine.  First he pried the door open from the convenience store.  And then put a chain around the ATM.  Put it on the bumper of his Cadillac.  I love that crime.  And he fucking drove away.  I love that crime.  And the ATM comes flying out.  Busts open.  And then he takes a few bucks and he's out.  And he drives away in his Cadillac.  Did he get.  But meanwhile, there's one picture of him just looking at the camera. 
[01:27:30]  Like, oops.  I love those pictures of someone when they go like, oh, there's a camera there.  And it's just their face looking at the camera.  If you're a robber, wouldn't you just assume there's cameras so you would just look down the whole time?  Why are these dummies always looking up?  Because the second you look at the camera, you're done.  It doesn't matter what happens next.  You're done.  You're caught.  You get the feeling that you might be quicker than the camera.  So you're like, look away real quick.  Look away.  No.  Or they break it or spray paint it.  They break it thinking all the information is in the camera. 
[01:28:00]  Meanwhile, it's already DVR'd somewhere.  It's too late.  It's too late.  ATM guy rules, though.  I love that.  I kind of like that cry.  They drag him right out of this fucking convenience store.  Deal with it later.  Hey, speaking of politicians, you want to do this Hank Johnson?  Hank Johnson's another great, great politician here.  Someone watch the time because Ian Halpert's calling right at eight and we're going to have to take a break before that.  Yeah.  And Ian better not blow us off because he's got Sandra Bullock pissed off. 
[01:28:30]  So I want to get his side of that story on the sex tape.  But first is Hank Johnson.  Yes, Ian.  Yeah, this is one of Obama's buddies, of course.  A Democrat, African-American gentleman.  And apparently he was questioning someone from the military about troop strength in Guam.  And this military expert, guy from the military, wants more troops on Guam.  And this gentleman apparently had some questions. 
[01:29:00]  So he was asking the military guy questions about Guam and the need for more troops or the not need for more troops on Guam.  Whether the troops will fit.  And this is Representative Hank Johnson.  Hank Johnson.  To your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.  Very small island and about 24 miles, if I recall, long. 
[01:29:30]  So 24 miles long, about seven miles wide at the least widest place on the wall.  That would be narrowest, asshole.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The way he's stumbling to speak English and just freezing up is, it's abominable.  How did this guy get elected?  And then wait until you see the pierced resistance of what he says. 
[01:30:00]  It's just ludicrous.  You want to learn a little bit more about this buddy guy, the old mayor from Providence?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Wait.  Hey, yeah.  Providence.  Yeah.  Okay.  Archie, Virginia.  Hey!  Archie, is this true or are you just fucking around?  No.  When he was mayor, he came home and he found his wife with another dude and he put out his cigar in this guy's face.  It was unbelievable.  And then he's, you know, it's a hero's welcome.  He spoke at my graduation and waived all our parking tickets. 
[01:30:30]  That's funny.  Great.  There you go.  Well, what do you want him to do?  I mean, it's like, you know, he catches somebody fucking his wife.  He puts a cigar out.  There's a lot worse places to have a cigar put out if you're fucking someone's wife.  Right, right.  You taint.  Where would be the worst place, I think, if somebody...  Inside your asshole.  I would go with penis hole.  Yeah.  Ow!  Penis hole.  Yeah.  Or right to your fucking bag.  That'd hurt.  That would suck.  That would suck, right?  Thank you, Archie.  All right, back to Hank Johnson.  The least widest place on the island and about 20, about 12 miles wide on the widest part 
[01:31:00]  of the island.  And I don't know how many square miles that is.  Do you happen to know?  I don't have that figure with me, sir.  I can certainly supply it to you if you'd like.  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip 
[01:31:30]  over and capsize.  We don't anticipate that.  And now...  Wait, what?  And this guy has to take him seriously?  The guy was laughing.  He was laughing at this fucking idiot sitting there.  That's what the silence is.  It's like him smiling and going like, uh...  I don't think... 
[01:32:00]  And this was not a joke.  You could tell from the setup.  He's asking about square miles and...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  He thinks the...  What?  He thinks Grom can tip over.  Meaning, like, capsize?  Like, he thinks all islands just float in the water.  They're floating and can capsize.  And they're not like mountains.  What an island is, idiot, is a mountain in the ocean that is taller than sea level.  So the top sticks out, but it's connected underneath. 
[01:32:30]  Nope.  This guy thinks that it's a fucking floating...  Dude, he thinks it's floating.  It's not a raft, you cunt.  He thinks Guam is floating.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm not shitting you.  He's a representative?  He's representing people out there?  This motherfucker got elected.  Where is he?  Where is he a representative?  You're crazy.  Stupidville.  All right.  That makes sense.  Wait, wait, wait.  That makes sense.  Or is he, like, saying, like, a capsized meaning it just...  Dude, he says, if too many Marines...  He means it literally? 
[01:33:00]  Yes!  It will tip over.  Go back and listen to it again.  It will tip over.  It can't be, like...  Let's go back.  He can't be trying to say something else.  No.  It will tip over and capsize.  We don't anticipate that.  The Guam population, I think, currently about 175,000.  And, again, with 8,000 Marines and their families, it's an addition of about 25,000 more into the population. 
[01:33:30]  Now, what happens if John Locke turned into the smoke monster?  Will the island still be able to support that many Marines?  And all the Marines being sent there to kill the people from Oceanic Flight A-15.  Do you care to comment?  We are scared that if too many people stand on the island, it will sink a hole in the earth and all the water will go into the hole. 
[01:34:00]  What a dumb motherfucker.  What a dummy.  Hank Johnson is a boob.  Hank Johnson's an idiot.  Hank Johnson's a fool.  Who's going to get to run against him?  Who lost to Hank Johnson?  Who's going to get to run against him?  Because all you'd have to do is play that clip over and over again. 
[01:34:30]  What was the platform of the guy who lost?  I say that we increase taxes and murder all newborns.  I can't vote for him.  I got to vote for capsizing Guam guy.  Hank Johnson, he likes babies.  Hank Johnson is a fucking boob.  A little info on this Hank Johnson.  He replaced, well, let Bill say it.  Bill in Georgia.  Go ahead.  Oh, Bill!  Hello, boys.  Hey, this guy is from the Atlanta district.  He replaced that ass Cynthia McKinney, the one that got her heart dated. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, that fucking bitch.  Cynthia McKinney was a fucking idiot, too.  She was the one that didn't show her ID, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because she got a new haircut.  Yeah.  She's got her hair.  She's out.  That's good she's out.  She was fucking shit.  So this guy replaced Cynthia McKinney.  What are they going to get down to?  Are they just going to get down to, like, put a...  In office. 
[01:35:30]  Just, you might as well at this point.  A waterhead would do better.  What the fuck are we going to do?  I think a waterhead even knows that islands don't just float.  Islands can't just capsize it.  Thank you, brother.  I mean, it's his...  Thank you.  That's humiliating.  And where is anybody talking about that?  How is everybody not going...  The tiger might be sexting, you dumb fucking media.  How about you write about this illiterate who thinks an island is going to tip over like 
[01:36:00]  a fucking fat chick on a raft in your pool.  Here's a prime example.  You get somebody like the moronic Dan Quayle who put an E at the end of potato on there,  which is spelling, not my strong suit.  I would have looked at that and said, well, it looks fine with an E on it.  I don't know.  You do pretty well, though.  You do well.  But they would not leave him alone about that.  That was front page news for I don't know how long.  And just fodder for comedians and talk shows and everything. 
[01:36:30]  Would George Bush say nuclear?  Yeah, yeah.  George Bush.  That was dummy.  Yeah, yeah.  This motherfucker is actually worried about Guam tipping over.  What's this guy's name?  Hank what?  Hank Johnson.  Hank Johnson is a horse's ass.  He is an idiot.  He does.  Yeah, he has hep C.  And they were saying that perhaps it's his medication.  They were trying everything to make excuses for this guy.  What does he take for fucking hep C?  An extra chromosome?  What a dope. 
[01:37:00]  Just call him what he is.  A dummy.  He's a fucking dummy.  Well, let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  God almighty.  Yeah, what the name of some of them other small islands?  Iwo Jima.  Waukiki.  Midway.  Long.  Long.  Road.  Long Island.  Thank God.  We pretty much have equally distributed people on the North Shore and the South Shore.  Don't tuck it.  Because I would hate to see Long Island tip over.  Martha's Vineyard.  He looks like a tranny. 
[01:37:30]  Like, even though he looks like a man.  Look at his eyes.  When you take his hair out of the picture.  He looks like a fucking...  Oh, I know.  I'm hauling a picture.  He really does.  He has like a bright...  He has like chick eyes.  He's an idiot.  What a fool he is.  I think the bridges, though, that connect Long Island to Manhattan, I think the bridges  would keep it from tipping.  You think they're stabilizing the island from fucking capsizing?  Yeah, thank God for those bridges or there'd be trouble.  And Manhattan would probably flip if it wasn't fastened to New Jersey.  Well, that's why you have to give your weight when you enter Manhattan and they tell you 
[01:38:00]  what side you can go to.  Yeah.  So the island doesn't tip over.  It'll tip.  What's worse?  This guy thinking islands might capsize or wasn't it Sherry Shepard thinking the world's  flat?  The world's flat.  Yeah, yeah.  She actually did not know if the world was flat.  Do we have that clip?  Because that is another fucking just genius clip.  I don't know what...  What...  What...  Why...  Who's teaching people things?  How do you not know that the world is...  It is round.  It is round at this point.  You got it, Travai? 
[01:38:30]  Is the world flat?  Is the world flat?  Yes.  I don't know.  What do you think?  I never thought about it, Whoopi.  Is the world flat?  I never thought about it.  You never thought about whether the world was round or flat?  No, because I...  But I'll tell you what I've thought about.  How I'm going to feed my child.  Well, you can do both.  How I'm going to take care of my family.  Shut the fuck up.  The world flat has never entered into...  That has not been an important thing to me.  You'll teach your son Jeffrey, right?  That's not important, right?  My son Jeffrey asked me if the world flat.  I guess I will go and...  You know, didn't come up with that.  My mum's already worked this question out. 
[01:39:00]  I mean, why are we doing this?  Why do they even have to do a TV show with her at this point?  Do you too?  Would you yank her off the panel?  Yes.  Barbara Walters, who I hate, she's like, well, you could do both.  Because she says, I'm more concerned about feeding my kids.  And Barbara goes, well, you could do both.  First of all, look.  You could answer that question and still feed your kids.  You're on the view.  You're probably not struggling to feed your fucking kids, all right?  And how about you take a look at the view and you'll see it's a fucking orb?  Yeah.  You fucking dummy.  Have you ever just looked at the horizon and wondered what was past it, dummy? 
[01:39:30]  Well, you fall off.  Do you?  Well, yes.  You really do.  It is flat.  It rests on a tortoise's back in space.  That's right.  By the way.  And we are at the center of the universe.  And they were very scared to keep walking.  What kind of idiot does not know at this point...  Thank you, Jimmy, for mouthing that out.  I agree wholeheartedly.  What kind of idiot?  Let me, allow me to retort.  Eh, who doesn't know the world is fucking round? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, obviously, a ninny.  Right.  A ninny.  Oh, is that what you said?  Okay.  You have to be a ninny to not think the world is round.  Oh, right.  Yeah, I agree.  It doesn't make any sense that in 2009, when that came out, that anybody in the civilized  world does not know that the planet Earth is round.  It is a sphere, or spherical.  You know, with all the people living on the east coast of America, why aren't we, like, 
[01:40:30]  kind of tipped into the water?  We are.  If everyone left, we'd tip back.  We would tip back.  It's a perfect balance right now.  So everyone's got to move to the middle of the country?  If everyone in China jumps, we're screwed, too, by the way.  We're screwed.  Earth off the axis.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know what an axis is, though, because it's flat.  So why would you have an axis?  That's more than one axe.  Axis.  No, that's more than one question.  Oh, Jim in New Jersey's got a very good observation. 
[01:41:00]  Jim, go ahead.  Jim.  Anthony, ever since you built that mansion, Long Island has been leaning to the right.  I don't know if you heard that, but ever since Anthony built his mansion on Long Island,  it is leaning to the right.  Yes.  You're fucking up the balance of Long Island right now.  No, I tried to pick a nice center point.  Look, we do have to take a break, because Ian Halpert is calling our show, which is awesome.  He's going to talk to us next.  He's all over the fucking place.  He actually made Sandra Bullock come out of hiding to say there's no fucking sex tape. 
[01:41:30]  She just wants to be left alone right now, and she had to say, no shit mustache tape exists.  No shit.  Poor lady.  And she is very mad at Ian Halpert.  Of course she isn't.  Welcome to this fine show, Opie and Anthony.  We will talk to him next.  Opie and Anthony.  Warnings.  On the virus.  Warnings.  Virus.  Warnings.  Series.  Series.  Series.  XM.  I'm Allie from Orlando, and I was jogging by a construction site and noticed a wow sticker  on a toolbox.  So, I showed my jugs, and they redid my entire patio in free of charge. 
[01:42:00]  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  I'm Cindy from Dallas, Texas.  I noticed a wow sticker in my boss's office, so I took a chance and I flashed him.  Now, I'm the VP of marketing.  My husband is so proud.  Thank you, ONA.  I'm Margo from New Jersey.  I was driving down I-78, and I saw an Opie and Anthony wow sticker.  So, I flashed this random guy, and he followed me 65 miles to my house, and now, we're engaged. 
[01:42:30]  Thanks, ONA.  It worked for them, and it could work for you ladies.  If you see a wow sticker, take a chance and show your breasts.  Webbermouth Wednesday, the Opie and Anthony show.  Webbermouth Wednesday, the Opie and Anthony, our pal Ian Halpern's on the phone. 
[01:43:00]  Now, this is a big story, huh?  So, Sandra Bullock comes out of hiding just to address our pal Ian Halpern about a sex tape.  So, let's say hi to Ian. 
[01:43:30]  What's going on, Ian?  Hey, all's good, gentlemen.  How are you today?  How are you, Ian?  Really good.  Yeah, really good?  Do you know the whole world is talking about you today?  Hey, look, you know, I have no idea because I'm actually in a location where I don't even have a dial-up speed right now.  So, I'm oblivious to it all today.  Tell me what's going on.  You don't even have a dial-up, huh?  No.  Wow.  Why?  Why wouldn't you have a dial-up?  I'm in a very remote location.  Ah, you're on, yeah, you're always on location.  Well, apparently, I'll fill you in, Ian, apparently, when you said that Jesse James, on your site, you implied that Jesse James had a sex tape of him and Sandra Bullock. 
[01:44:00]  And it's repulsive.  It involves a lot of very filthy things that one wouldn't expect Sandra Bullock to be engaged in.  And him wearing a Nazi outfit.  Yes.  You know, some type of really dirty anal activity, just kind of gross.  Holding a shotgun.  Yeah.  A lot of, a lot of, it conjures up quite the filthy image, Ian. 
[01:44:30]  And she actually, her first statement since this whole story broke about Jesse James cheating on her was to address your website and your statement that there is indeed a sex tape.  What's your response to Sandra Bullock's response?  Before I give you my response, let me guys, let me ask you a question.  Let me call you guys on this.  Sure. 
[01:45:00]  Who are you siding with here, Bullock or His Highness?  I am His Highness.  You know what?  I'll say it.  I've always been in camp, His Highness.  Yeah, I'm Team Highness.  All right.  Let me tell you.  I hope you're right.  I know the world's media corps is chasing me this morning.  Of course.  I've been tipped off by that.  Let me tell you something.  You're getting the exclusive as usual.  I'm in a remote location.  Nobody's going to find me where I am today.  It just turns out that way.  It wasn't planned.  I'm not hiding from Jesse James. 
[01:45:30]  I'm not hiding from Sandra Bullock.  In fact, I wish them both the best, and I invite them to come out and clear it up.  I'm glad that Ms. Bullock has come out of the closet and has started to clear things up, according to her.  Her statement was terse.  Her statement to me, there's a lot more she's got to explain.  I'm willing to go on the Opie and Anthony show with her anytime, one-on-one, and to grill her about the information I have.  And if she can convince me that I'm wrong, I will retract it on this show. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, but at this point, are you still standing by that there is a sex tape?  Well, first off, let me tell you something.  Okay.  Three days after I revealed there was a sex tape, Radar Online came out yesterday and said I was wrong by 11 tapes.  They said there's at least 12 sex tapes involving Mr. James wearing Nazi Aperol.  And so I apologize to the world. 
[01:46:30]  I said there's one.  There might be 12, according to Radar Online.  And Radar Online has broken some good stories, as we all know.  Now, we understand Jesse James might be involved in something.  He hasn't come out and made a statement about sex tapes.  But Sandra Bullock, would any of these tapes include Sandra Bullock?  Well, that's the question.  My source says yes.  And your source is close friends of Sandra Bullock and Jesse James, right? 
[01:47:00]  Let me be very clear.  This isn't according to Ian Halperin.  Ian Halperin is just a journalist documenting what he receives from his sources.  You are mere conduit.  That's very clear on my website, ianundercover.com.  I have nothing against either of these parties.  I do find it alarming, as the son of a Holocaust survivor, that Mr. James is fucking women with swastikas, is wearing Nazi garb. 
[01:47:30]  His lawyer says, oh, he's blaming it on the Jewish godfather.  Excuse me.  The last time I heard someone in court say, hey, the father sent me the gun and I'm sorry that I killed 10 people, that doesn't fly.  No.  That doesn't fly with his highness.  Now, let me tell you, I look forward.  If Mr. James or Bullock pursues this in court, my legal team's ready.  I'm not taking this lightly. 
[01:48:00]  I'm going to go on the offensive toot-sweet.  Do you know what toot-sweet means?  It means very quickly.  It means promptly.  Lickety-split.  I have been positioning from the get-go on this.  His highness is ready to go, and I intend to retain the top Jewish rights advocates as well as the top attorneys in the United States of America to defend me.  So right now, you're not hiding from Jesse James.  You're not hiding from Sandra Bullock.  No, I'm actually doing something else.  Hiding from a process server. 
[01:48:30]  I'm certainly not hiding from either of them.  And again, I wish them the best.  I don't think, either way, Bullock, I'm honored that she came out and made a statement.  And if she's right, I will retract.  Maybe it is somewhat else.  I have not seen the video.  I've only been told this by my source.  Now, let me ask you, do you feel guilty that, you know, she's kind of in hiding and she's been kind of keeping it on the DL, and the first thing she had to make public was a statement that, no, indeed, she was not having a shit mustache smeared under her nose? 
[01:49:00]  You know, Lord, let me tell you something.  Poor Sandra.  She just wants to talk about her Oscar, and she has to come out and go, no, Ian's wrong.  I do not have duty on my face while being sodomized with a rifle.  On the record, I know for a fact she knew that James was cheating on her, and she got up and accepted that gold statue.  Really?  And do you recall that speech? 
[01:49:30]  I absolutely do.  She thanked him.  Yes, yes.  Well, that wasn't the Oscar speech, though.  Wasn't it a bit outside the box?  You didn't smell a matzo ball over there, like something was cooking that didn't smell kosher?  Wait, so you think that she knew at that point that he was cheating?  Yes, 100 percent, and I hope she comes out and denies that.  I will prove her wrong.  Wow, Ian.  Standing by his story.  Ian Halpern.  I thought you would come on the show and say, all right, all right, I don't know anything. 
[01:50:00]  Do you think that Jesse James has this fascination with Nazism?  Do you think he's a white supremacist?  I don't think that.  My opinion doesn't matter.  I'm just a journalist.  Other people think that.  Do you think he is?  Go to my site.  There's a photo of him wearing a Nazi hat.  I understand that.  I think there is a difference between somebody taking tasteless photos and actually being a white supremacist, though. 
[01:50:30]  Let me tell you, that photo was not taken October 31st.  No, no, no, no, no, let me confirm that.  Well, Prince, who was it, Prince Harry at one point dressed up in Nazi regalia.  And he apologized.  For a party.  But he was taken to task for it.  He didn't come out and say that the Duke of Edinburgh sent him the costume and he put it on.  He didn't make some lame excuse.  Right.  This guy is blaming it on others, that he's doing the Hitler mustache and wearing a Nazi hat. 
[01:51:00]  That doesn't fly.  Let me ask you a question.  How stupid can America be?  I know O&A listeners, and I've got to call it O&A and N now, because it's Opie Anthony and A. Norton.  I've officially changed the name of your show.  All right.  It's about time.  Thank you.  It really is.  It's been 10 years.  It's the Canadian version.  Yeah.  But I know your listeners aren't stupid.  They email me all the time.  You have smart people listening to this show.  They're not going to buy this lame excuse that Mr. James is putting out. 
[01:51:30]  And then soon he's going to deny ever sleeping with women behind bullets back, and America's going to be spoon-fed that.  Everyone, wake up.  Smell the coffee.  I have a question.  Yes.  Smell the schnitzel.  Poor Sandra Bullock has just kind of been holed up in a, you know, just trying to be surrounded by people who love her and family, and she's not ready to talk publicly.  I did her at service.  Do you feel odd that the first thing she had to do was come out and deny making German shit porn in her own house? 
[01:52:00]  She just wants to be.  She's an Oscar winner.  She just won an Oscar, and she can't talk about her Oscar.  She has to say, no, I did not have a gun pointed at me while my tattooed husband smeared feces under my nose while being sodomized brutally.  She just wants to hang out with the gals in Hollywood, and she has to deal with this.  Be one of the Hollywood elite.  Are you guys saying that she's really as clean as she says she is?  Let me guess.  The whole relationship was platonic, too.  That's what she said.  No, no, Ian, what I think is she has had quite a squeaky clean image her entire career. 
[01:52:30]  She hasn't been in the tabloids for any kind of scandalous thing over the years, so it's a little hard for the public to grasp the fact that she is doing something so profane.  Well, it was hard for the public to grasp that Bill Clinton was getting a blowjob in the White House.  It was hard for us to grasp, you know, that everything that we read. 
[01:53:00]  But you know what it is?  There is a difference between guys and girls, though.  If you hear that Paris Hilton has a sex tape, it doesn't faze you.  You expect it.  But somebody like Sandra Bullock, you would think something would have come out sooner if she had been this slutty woman that is being portrayed.  You're asking me.  I'm saying I'm leaving the door open.  My source said that.  Radar Online says there's at least 12 sex videos after my story came out a few days later. 
[01:53:30]  They came out with that.  I'm leaving the door open.  If my source got the person wrong in the video, I will apologize to Bullock.  But I'm not letting her off the hook for one thing, that she lied to the world when she thanked her husband at the Oscar speech.  I'm not backing down on that.  She already knew that there was some stuff going on.  Maybe that was just trying to sweep things under the carpet and keep people from, you know, to keep this from happening.  Or maybe she was setting that up. 
[01:54:00]  Let me talk for a second.  Maybe she was setting that up so she becomes the victim when it all comes out.  And my question to you guys, is she really the victim?  Is she what?  Is she really the victim?  I think if you're in a marriage and this guy is cheating with numerous women, that, yeah, in that sense, she is the victim.  Let me ask you something.  All right.  Go ahead.  She didn't do due diligence there.  If your daughter would hook up with a guy like Jesse James, this is a dead ringer for trouble. 
[01:54:30]  It's not like someone pulling the wool over anyone's eyes.  She should have known from the get-go what she's getting into.  Some girls do enjoy going out with the bad boy.  And sometimes it could be a persona.  This guy is on television.  He's got this tough guy persona.  And perhaps she was under the impression he wasn't like this in real life.  I don't buy that.  Let me tell you.  Why don't we start fixing up women with Charles Manson?  Why don't we, you know, why don't we go that route if we want bad boy? 
[01:55:00]  You've got to do your homework.  And being a smart woman, which she is, she's got to admit that she failed here.  She didn't do proper background research on this, dude.  He has a long history of womenizing.  Oh, love is such a weird thingy, and you don't do a background check on somebody you fall for.  It's lust.  He banged her like no one else could, and that's what got in her way.  You think so, yeah?  A little lust action.  Two weeks after they got married, he got a woman pregnant. 
[01:55:30]  Did he really?  What?  It's the woman saying this.  So wait, where did he meet Bullocky?  How did these two bump into each other?  You know what?  I'm not a historian on this relationship.  I know they met somewhere, and they, you know, they...  Well, apparently, yes.  I couldn't do it.  I'm not writing a book about it.  Ian, more important...  Hold on.  Let's go back.  So he gets a girl pregnant only two weeks into the relationship with Sandra Bullock, the marriage?  She says she aborted the child.  Who is this brud? 
[01:56:00]  Who is this good egg?  Google her.  Google?  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  All right, listen...  Where's my, by the way, where's my intro to Google it?  I don't hear it anymore.  Google it.  Google it.  I'm in the mood here.  Listen, we got Brendan once in again today.  Brendan?  From whatwithtylerderdendo.com.  It's a big story, and they picked up on your story there, right?  Yes, they did.  Yeah, they gave you a little publicity yesterday.  I respect Brendan.  You know what?  I respect anyone who's a player.  All the people sitting on their couches eating potato chips, knocking his highness today, 
[01:56:30]  I have zero respect for.  But anyone who's playing and making noise and doing their job, it's fair comment.  I hear you.  That's very nice of you.  Brendan.  You're on with Ian Halperin.  Rihanna is better at ducking than this dickhead is at reporting.  All right, Ian, have you ever said anything that's come true?  Have you ever made a prediction like this?  You know, I won't even defend that, because my fans know whatever I say is right on.  Let me ask you something, Brendan. 
[01:57:00]  Ian, I went through every post on your website.  When's your bar mitzvah?  You've never said anything that was the king.  When's your bar mitzvah?  I'm sorry, what?  When's your bar mitzvah?  Just a sigh.  Just a sigh of disgust.  Now Brendan understands what we go through.  Can you answer anything?  Can you, when's Reggie Bush losing his Heisman?  When's the Tiger Woods sex tape coming out?  When is Kate Hudson giving birth to Alex Rodriguez's kid? 
[01:57:30]  When are J-Lo and her husband break up?  None of this shit you ever say happens.  You know what, Brendan?  I'm not even going to answer your questions, because they are just so infantile and so ridiculous,  and your facts are all wrong, that if you ever want a course in Journalism 101, I'll gladly  give it to you.  But until you take the finest course of journalism, I won't even talk to you, but let's talk about  other stuff.  Michael Jackson died, and Ian said that was going to happen. 
[01:58:00]  It's true.  What's that one about, Brendan?  Michael Jackson died there, Brendan.  Within six months.  Yeah, Ian said that Michael Jackson had lung disease, and he was dying of lung disease.  And it's in the autopsy, you douche, that he should have a lung disease.  And listen, put the machine gun on now for this douchebag.  He's riling up his harness.  I'm sequestered with security, and here you go, you douchebag.  Look, Dickhead, how someone died is pretty goddamn relevant to the story, okay?  He didn't die of lung disease. 
[01:58:30]  He died of an overdose, all right?  I can't chop off a hooker's head and tell the cops she was congested.  It's pretty goddamn relevant.  Dude, you couldn't even get a job at the Laugh Factory the way you're going tonight.  Here you go.  One more time.  Start dancing, you douche.  Now, Brendan, what are you...  He's playing sound effects now.  Oh, is he?  Yeah, Ian is.  This is for Brendan. 
[01:59:00]  What is it?  I don't know.  I just want to know from Brendan, what do you think of this story now, the whole sex tape thing?  What's your take on it, based on what you've heard?  Look, I don't pretend to be a reporter like Ian does.  Here's what I know.  It's sort of like what you just said.  Demolition Man came out in 1993.  Sandra Bullock has been really famous for a really long time.  And you've never heard anything bad about the woman.  I mean, in all that time.  And now she goes from no bad stories ever to this crap. 
[01:59:30]  Do you know who wrote Demolition Man?  What?  Do you know who wrote Demolition Man?  No, Ian.  Look, go back to the Pride.  Do you know who wrote Demolition Man?  What?  Do you know who wrote Demolition Man?  Ian Halpern.  Is it relevant to anything?  I'm sure.  It's very relevant.  I'm wondering.  Who wrote it?  Do you know, Brendan?  No, I don't.  And it's not relevant to anything. 
[02:00:00]  Who the hell cares?  Who wrote Demolition Man?  He's actually a Montrealer.  And then call us when the drugs kick out a bit.  Because this is ridiculous.  Let's move on.  I wish Brendan the best.  I wish him good health.  I hope his family's fine.  But, you know, I have nothing to talk to him about.  Another fine call from Brendan.  Thank you, Brendan.  From what would tylerderndoo.com.  Thank you.  Who gives nothing but love to the Opie and Anthony show, Ian.  Yeah.  Nothing but love.  Hey, Brendan.  So is Ian.  All right.  Listen.  So I think.  Ian respects, Brendan. 
[02:00:30]  I think we got all the Sandra Bullock stuff out.  Now you got Tiger Woods at the Masters.  You got anything on that?  Well, how's he going to do?  I want your guys' prediction.  Well, I would love to see him win it all.  It would just be just an amazing story.  But I think he's too rusty to actually, you know, win it this time around.  I say he'll go.  He hasn't played in, you know, in a competitive way in too long.  I say he's going to bat about 245.  He'll have a couple of stolen bases.  But it's not going to be a particularly good season.  He plays golf, Jimmy. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, well, in that case, he's going to go 40 under par birdie.  And he's going to have a mulligan.  Fucking dumb golf terms.  You think the Tiger.  He's going to do like Shelly Duncan numbers.  Yeah.  Remember Shelly Duncan?  Of course we do.  She wrote Demolition Man.  I want Anthony's prediction on this.  I think he's going to do pretty good, to tell you the truth.  I think he's a very focused guy when it comes to golf.  He's had nothing like this, but he's had adversity before in his life, the passing of his father and everything. 
[02:01:30]  And he seems to snap back.  Golf seems to be his center.  And I think he's going to do very well.  I can't believe Anthony and I are agreeing on something.  Yes.  Because I'm on the exact same page as you.  Thank you, sir.  I think he's going to pass with flying colors.  Thank you, His Highness.  And we're all going to forget the sex scandal.  Thank you, His Highness.  And the Tiger Woods news is pretty much drying up at this point, right?  I think everyone's just going to start moving on.  I want to know if he's got anything about...  Woods is in awe of the James Bullock story. 
[02:02:00]  He loves it.  Does Sandra Bullock?  It's just the focus.  Nobody cares about him anymore.  Yeah, that's true.  Ian, do you have anything on the Jim Carrey breakup?  Jim Carrey, man.  Look, I can't diss any Canadian.  I wish him the best.  I think there's something there.  He doesn't last with women.  And I have no idea.  It's unfortunate.  Sex tape?  I know he has a daughter.  He's a good dad.  Yeah.  But for some reason, he just can't last with... 
[02:02:30]  He's got to meet a Jill Nicolini type or something.  But until then, I think he's going to be playing solo.  Hmm.  Okay.  All right.  And finally, don't you do the His Highness blind thing for us now?  Yeah, the His Highness blind this week, I'm going to put it out,  that a major film star from 2007 is opting for a sex change.  Wait, wait.  A major film star from 2007. 
[02:03:00]  What were the big movies in 2007, Dave?  Is opting for a sex change?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Now, a man or a woman?  If I say it, I'm going to give it away.  Anyway, I want your listeners to figure it out,  and I'm going to give more clues in the coming weeks.  Wait, a major film star from 2007.  Hold on.  Let us just Google.  Danny's looking for...  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  You know something?  Was it an Academy Award-nominated film?  Wouldn't we have heard something about this? 
[02:03:30]  It's a big name.  Well, that's not my question.  Who has sort of faded into obscurity the last couple of years.  But in 2007, this person was a big deal.  A big deal in 2007.  Wow.  Big deal in 2007.  What were you guys doing in 2007?  Do you have any...  Oh, my God.  I was being fucked in the ass by somebody holding a rifle,  rubbing a shit mustache on my face.  That's a weird coincidence, Jimmy.  Yeah, it really is.  Really strange.  With a big SB on my back.  Any movies pop out, boys? 
[02:04:00]  Do you guys even remember the year 2007?  Yeah, we remember.  Okay, let's look at the Oscar...  Hold on, Ian.  Let's look at the Oscar list, because that'll help.  I don't think it's an Oscar list.  But, I mean, it might help spur some...  What did you guys...  I think it's a blockbuster film.  Your tax returns, 2007.  Give me the number.  All three of you.  Mine was three.  I made about a tenth of that.  I don't remember.  No, I'm not.  I'm $3.  Oh, that's what I said.  $3.  How does the show work?  Did the three of you split the kitty, or who's the highest paid guy? 
[02:04:30]  Yes, it goes, it goes, it goes, um, it goes, uh, 43, 43, I know I did too much.  I meant to go 45, 45, 10.  All right, we're looking at Oscar winners.  Yeah, we are.  Yeah, yeah, just because that might...  I don't know if it's Oscar winners.  It might not be, but at least they were big movies.  It might spark.  I don't think it's Oscar winners.  All right, you all get one gift.  Okay.  Really?  Yeah, because he knows we're going Oscar films.  All right, I don't want an Oscar film, then.  I don't want Oscar films.  I want a big fucking moneymaker from 2007.  I don't want it. 
[02:05:00]  I don't want no fucking Oscar winner.  I want to see if it sparks a fucking memory.  Okay.  All right, I'm going to go...  Yeah, right on.  I'm going to go with Squarehead.  Me and him are on the same page today.  Ian Halpern, this is Opie.  I guess Kevin Spacey.  Ah, he's going to become a man.  Yeah.  It ain't Spacey.  Fuck you, Squarehead.  It's not Spacey. 
[02:05:30]  All right, that was my guess.  Was it a good guess, though, Ian?  It was clear.  You're warm.  I know who it is, actually.  I'm warm.  Hal Holbrook is going to become a woman.  That was a movie.  Hal Holbrook said in an interview that ever since The Fog, he's wanted a cunt.  I don't know if you picked up on that.  But, guys, if he's saying warm, now we're talking about a man.  Go man.  I said they share two vowels in their names, if that's any clue.  They share two vowels.  Who's they? 
[02:06:00]  Kevin Spacey?  Kevin Spacey and the person I'm talking about is opting for a sex change.  Oh.  Now we got a spell?  Kevin.  Kevin Costner.  No, no, that's the same name.  I would say...  I guarantee one of your listeners knows, and they're going to email with him.  You think?  Let's see.  Eve St. Laurent?  I hope it's not my bodyguard, who's probably the only person who knows.  Your bodyguard.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Is it, uh...  Holy shit, I got the fucking answer.  Oh.  Wait.  Yeah, hold on a minute.  Rue McClanahan?  Hold on.  We got John in New York.  I like this guess a lot.  I'm not sure about the sharing of the what?  The vowels.  Vowels.  Wait, vowels.  Constants are hard.  Vowels.  2007.  John in New York, you're on with His Highness Ian Halperin.  Is it Mike Myers?  Damn, it's Mike Myers.  Holy shit, Ian.  You guys are picking on Canadians. 
[02:07:00]  Don't pick on a guy.  I was just going to say.  Let me tell you something.  I have a good Mike Myers story.  When he did that film, The Yogi, what was that film called?  Oh, that horrible movie.  Yeah.  That we helped promote.  He grew up in Canada, and an ex-girlfriend of mine worked on the film.  And she's in there.  A couple of scenes.  But what she told me was, anyone on set who looked at Myers, eye to eye, was fired.  You weren't allowed to even look at him.  Really?  And that, to me, is absurd.  Ridiculous.  I never understand that. 
[02:07:30]  You know, it's just, you know, look, I hate to break it to Myers.  At the end of the day, we're all checking into the same hotel, including him.  And he's not exempt.  And to have an attitude like that, I've just lost total respect.  I think I know who it is.  Although he is Canadian, that's the only thing I respect about him.  I think I know who it is, by the way.  I have a real guess.  And I'm not going to say my source, but it was just texted to me.  I know Norton's going to...  Go ahead, Norton.  Norton's going to nail him.  Norton.  It was just texted to me by a friend.  I'm not going to say who it is, although he'll be in here shortly. 
[02:08:00]  Hillary Swank.  Aw, shit.  Look, I'll leave you guys on that note.  Aw, shit.  It's a blind item.  It's a blind item by His Highness Ian Halpern.  Yes.  In that case, David Patterson.  Ian, another fine appearance on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, merci beaucoup, tout le monde.  And I wish everyone a great day and have a great weekend, because mine's starting right now.  All right.  See you later, man.  Take care. 
[02:08:30]  Peace out, guys.  There goes Ian Halpern.  He's got a closing fucking statement he's going to do with that weekend.  That is...  Dude.  Wow, we heard from him about the Sandra Bullock thing.  He has responded to what Sandra has said.  And what the hell did he even say?  Wait.  He said if she can prove that it's not her, he will give her an apology and a retraction.  On our show.  Yeah.  Hey, does the syllable thing match up?  I think it does. 
[02:09:00]  I will credit Tom Papa fully.  He texted me, Hillary Swank, booyah.  Ah, booyah!  Booyah.  All right, why don't we do this?  Because he doesn't have a lot of time.  Just bring him in.  I got to take a leak.  If you guys want to start with Papa, that's fine.  You want to start?  Yeah, bring him in.  Or how about we do a short break?  We could do short.  Do you have to pee yet?  We could do whatever you guys want.  I could, you know something?  Short break.  Short break.  I could take a leak.  All right.  I could take a leak.  We'll do a short break.  Tom Papa next.  He's a very funny guy.  He's doing the Stress Factory this weekend.  Of course, the marriage...  Thursday through Saturday.  The marriage ref on NBC as well.  So this guy's career has taken off. 
[02:09:30]  Nice to see you.  Hey, man.  Let's get into this.  We got Tom Papa in studio.  Playing the Stress Factory.  New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Thursday through Saturday.  At Vinny's Fine Club.  732-545.  Ha!  Ha!  That would be 4242.  Or StressFactory.com.  And, of course, the marriage ref on NBC every Thursday at 10 o'clock.  Thank you.  I wasn't here the last time you were in, Tom.  No, you were gone.  I had a little sick day.  I was sad.  Aw.  Were you? 
[02:10:00]  Were you really?  You still have tissues.  Are you okay now?  Yeah, I'm all right.  A lingering condition.  Yeah, it's one of those long colds that Rock Hudson got.  It's allergy season.  You know, you got to fucking blow out your snot.  He was sick for years.  Yeah, he just couldn't stop sniffling and losing weight.  Tom, we liked your guess.  Thank you.  We liked your guess.  Ian Halpern saying that somebody's going to have a sex change.  Yeah.  That was really big in 2007.  And that Hilary Swank, I think that's right in the ballpark.  Little boy boobs already. 
[02:10:30]  When did she win for a movie?  Million Dollar?  Yeah.  That was probably 2000.  It better be, or then your guess sucks.  Yeah.  Your guess is either amazing or a monumental swing and miss.  Failure.  Ian could be wrong about 2007.  She always played a boy.  Yep.  Boys Don't Cry.  Right.  Was it 2004?  Wait, Million Dollar Baby was 2004?  I thought it was older.  Really?  Oh, fuck.  2004.  How old am I?  I feel like I'm just hurtling through space.  You really are. 
[02:11:00]  You reach a point where it's just like, what happened?  Right.  Why is, wasn't it just 2002?  Slow it down.  There's no slowing it down.  Dying.  I have a whole theory on that.  When you're a kid, you're constantly looking forward to things.  Yeah.  Your birthday and Christmas and things like that.  So time takes forever.  Yeah.  You know, you're looking for summer vacation.  And when you get older, you're constantly trying to put things off, like bills and death.  Right.  And things like that.  All those same things.  You're like, Christmas again, damn it.  And when you're waiting for something, it takes forever. 
[02:11:30]  When you're putting something off, it goes real quick.  Right.  So time just fucking flies by.  Yeah.  Month by month is like, oh, that bill again.  I can't do it.  It just sucks.  So we got to go.  You know what we got to do?  Play kick the can.  Oh, yeah.  Kick the can.  Kick the can.  We're going to play kick the can.  And wait for Christmas.  We'll be young again.  It's the slowest year ever.  Was that Scamman Brothers?  Yeah.  From the Twilight Zone movie.  Ah, very good.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  How is it going?  Oh, yeah.  Kick the can.  Kick the can.  Yeah, really?  Why don't you go get an axe in your chest at the Old Mac Hotel?  I love Kevin the shot.  I love his room in The Shining.  Oh, is that the best of the big Afro girls?  Yeah.  And his giant black toes at the end of the bed.  Big Afro painting over his tootsie room.  He's peeking over a black fence with his big toes.  Big naked Afro ladies.  What a shitty vacation.  I'm in Florida.  I got to check in on some folks. 
[02:12:30]  They're real assholes.  He's got to fly coach back into 10 degree weather on Continental and fucking talk to  Larry Durker.  Larry Durker got him the snow cat.  Yes, that's Apollo Creed's trainer.  Apollo Creed's trainer.  That's right.  I need a snow cat.  I got to get up there and check on some folks.  25 miles in the snow and ice instead of fucking fingering some fucking Cuban in Miami, which  is what he wanted to do. 
[02:13:00]  Just to get an axe in your chest the first second you're inside the building.  His jacket wasn't off.  No.  You like ice cream, Doc?  And he had the worst comeback ever when she goes, we call him a Doc.  How do you know?  He goes, well, he looks like a Doc.  Oh, really?  Good cover.  No one thinks of that.  I'm talking to him through my mind.  There he is.  There he is.  Just relaxing.  Those hot paintings.  You know his hand's going to creep down his pants in a few minutes looking at those paintings. 
[02:13:30]  I imagine that's what Ian Halpern looks like as he's sequestered somewhere.  He's just kind of hanging out in a room like that.  The best is just lounging around.  He has his feet on a pillow.  I know.  Yeah, what the fuck?  I got the gout.  I got the gout.  Is that a genuine J.J. Evans painting up behind him, too?  This is the greatest.  James!  This is like military style room.  This is like the guy who's just, there's no comfort.  He's just, I'm going to lay on my bed. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, what is it?  Is he in a hotel?  Masturbate to this afro.  The great thing was in that scene where he had to make the face.  When he was being contacted, they said Kubrick did like 80 takes until he got the face, until  he got what he wanted.  Really?  Right.  Yeah.  Fucking.  80 takes.  Enough of your takes.  But boy, he got a doozy when that kid was fucking drooling and Scatman Crothers was shaking.  Boy, he got a good take.  Those were people communicating.  There it is.  There it is.  Look at the fucking horror on his face. 
[02:14:30]  You like ice cream, Doc?  Yeah.  I like ice cream.  He's horrified that he's going to yell another take.  Yeah.  It was the opposite of Ed Wood, that Kubrick.  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be fun with Kubrick.  He's crazy.  And 20 legs of lamb.  Yeah, that's right.  And 20 legs of lamb.  I have to go from here to Martha Stewart show to make lemon cake.  I was about to say that.  Lemon cake.  He's got a heart out at 915 because he's got to bake a cake with Martha Stewart. 
[02:15:00]  Lemon cake.  This is so hilarious.  This is what happens when you get real fame?  You got to hang out with Martha Stewart?  Oh, yeah.  We're going to mix it up today with Tom Papa.  We're going to make some lemon cake.  Lemon cake.  From lemon party to lemon cake.  Anybody knows that website?  On her TV show?  Lemon party.  On the TV show, at least?  On the TV show.  All right.  Oh, wow.  That's a little better than the radio show.  So what are you going to have to do?  Like, okay, take this and mix it.  Now, dude, you got to mix it.  I don't know.  I'm trying to think of something funny to say about mixing something. 
[02:15:30]  To 60-year-old women in the studio.  Cooking segments seem to be very difficult to be funny.  How do you do them?  I've never done it.  All right.  I'll stir it here.  Okay, you stir this.  I'm going to do this.  Just come off a little deep.  Just don't slip off.  Like, Anthony could never do that show because he'd be mixing.  And she'd go, well, you're mixing good.  He'd go, well, mixing is never bad, as busing showed us in the 60s.  You should never mix, as in races.  Because this is the only thing I like mixing is cake. 
[02:16:00]  Never chocolate and vanilla.  He'd wake at Martha and she'd be horrified.  Oh, you're spicy.  Oh, boy.  No.  Oh, great party.  Oh, that was the worst.  How great is that?  That was so disturbing.  The guy's getting blown by a guy in a fucking, what was it, like a little beaver outfit or something?  Yeah, and he just looks up and stares at the camera.  I was like 12 when I saw that.  I was like, what does that mean?  I have some privacy here at the Overlook.  Why is he in his lap?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's blowing the guy in a piggy mask. 
[02:16:30]  That was so scary.  Dude, the best is on the video is the music.  And this is where Kubrick was, it was horrifying, was the, do we have that on video, Danny, anywhere on YouTube?  The way the camera would fucking zoom in, it was like, jong, jong.  Yeah, it would go incrementally, like, closer to whatever was happening.  That is a terrifying fucking film.  Terrifying.  If you're not scared of The Shining, you're a rock.  Yeah.  You're a fucking rock. 
[02:17:00]  And my daughter had to be corrected.  Yeah.  Correct.  Even the opening scene when they're driving up the mountain with that fucking music.  Yeah.  Jeez.  You're like, oh, it seems like this should be happy.  They're driving up to the mountain and that music kicks in.  You're like, oh, no.  This can't be good.  This isn't going to be good at all.  Nicholson's already a psycho looking over his fucking eyes unshaven.  That's right, Danny.  There we go.  When my wife tried to stop me from doing my duty, she had to be corrected. 
[02:17:30]  She's walking up.  Shelly Duvall's got the knife.  She was amazing.  Oh, crazy.  First use of the Steadicam, really.  Here you go.  She sees the knees.  Oh, there it is.  He just looks up.  Look at his ass sticking out.  His ass is sticking out of his little piggy suit.  Yeah, that is like just...  I didn't know what that meant.  I was just so disturbed.  Yeah, what are they doing?  I just got chills.  Look at that.  She's got that big knife.  The shadows on the walls are great.  She's just freaking out. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I don't know.  I think we ought to take Danny to the hospital.  I think we ought to take Danny to...  That would be, by the way, seeing a guy in a pig outfit blowing a friend.  That would be bad at the height of tourism.  Right.  Nobody was supposed to be in the hotel.  Yeah, at the height of tourism.  Shut your door.  Come on.  What do you know?  Yeah, you'd be horrified even if it was packed.  Dude, it was Fourth of July weekend.  That would be awful.  This was just her and her husband and kid in a fucking little Apollo space shirt. 
[02:18:30]  Just a momentary lapse.  For a second, for a second.  A couple of foot pounds of pressure.  Why is it the most rare scene?  For a second.  Can we see the...  Anyone get a photo blog, Danny?  Oh, so scary.  A screen cap of the ass when she first looks in before they pop up together.  Did you ever notice that before?  Never noticed his ass was sticking out.  That's because his things are down like those oldie time pajamas.  Yeah, right.  The cartoon pajamas.  His ass is sticking out.  He was just fluffing the guy and then he was going to get his ass fucked. 
[02:19:00]  This is how powerful this is.  Oh, you know, I never even thought of that.  20 years later, you can find something else that's disturbing you even more.  Yes.  Yeah, he's just fluffing them up.  Look at that.  I never knew that his bare bottom was sticking out of his beaver costume.  I never did either.  That's just hanging out.  But wait.  And if you see, the other guy's pants were around his ankles.  Yeah.  You can look down.  You see the guy's kneeling.  You look through the doorway.  You don't see anything.  You see pants around the ankles and the guy's knees. 
[02:19:30]  So you can see that he really is sucking his dick.  And then the guy's face that's sitting there getting head.  He looks like you just interrupted his PowerPoint presentation.  He's completely unfazed.  Hey, wait a minute.  I'm getting blown by a bear.  Excuse me.  I'm being blown by a ghost dressed in a beaver costume.  Oh, no.  His pants are up.  I'm sorry.  No, they were around his knees.  I don't think you could see it there.  I think that's his dinner jacket and the bed.  I think that might be the bedspread. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  She's just sitting on the bed because he's got black pants on.  God, that's fantastic.  But the...  Holy cow.  He was a stickler for focus.  What a bad blow job that fucking fat bunny pig man must have given.  Fat bunny pig man.  Who would want to be blown by that big...  Hey, we got an explanation.  It's a doggy suit.  Let's say how to Pat.  Doggy suit.  On Long Island.  Pat, you got something on this scene from The Shining?  Yeah.  In the novel, evidently one of the guests in the hotel was a gangster who I think had sex  with an actor. 
[02:20:30]  And the gangster wasn't really gay.  He just hit every once in a while from that side of the plate.  So it was a bargain.  Dress up in a little doggy suit.  And I'll let you suck my cock.  Really?  It's getting more disturbing.  Yeah.  It's like the never ending.  It really is.  Disturbing.  But the best part is that he's sucking his cock with the light on and the door wide open.  Yeah.  They wanted to be caught.  And she's being totally quiet and fucking piggy dog sharp teeth man fucking hears her and  pops up. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  How do you hear her?  You like animal blowjobs, Doc?  Yeah.  And why is he...  Is he embarrassed now that someone saw?  Like, the whole thing isn't embarrassing enough?  He's got his hatchback down.  Oh.  Because some woman being chased by her psychotic husband saw them.  We're not alone.  They're not going to help her.  It's like, you probably think she'd go, could you guys help me?  My husband's coming with an axe.  Sorry.  He's coming in my mask.  He's thinking it right.  I thought my husband was a mess. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  These are the sane people in the house.  Oh, I see.  His pants aren't down.  You should be corrected.  Danny.  He's just getting a fucking great blowjob.  Who did this to you, Danny?  You heard him.  Why?  Hair of the dog that bit me, Lloyd.  Wow.  Maybe we should get Danny a dog suit.  You like pets, Danny?  Isn't Lloyd just the best bartender? 
[02:22:00]  Lloyd would be the kind of bartender I would just want to sit down and have a chat with.  That's right.  Yeah.  He's right Johnny on the spot with your whiskey.  Your credits.  Yeah, yeah.  Your money's no good here, Mr. Torrance.  Your money's no good here, Mr. Torrance.  You're ready.  Your money's no good here, Mr. Torrance.  I'd like to know who's buying my drinks for me, Lloyd.  And he basically tells him, mind your fucking beeswax.  Yeah.  And he said, it's not a matter that concerns you at this time.  All right.  I'll take the drink.  Okay.  I'll take the ghost drink. 
[02:22:30]  I'll get ghost drunk.  Have you seen that dog guy around?  I can use some head.  Where the fuck is the dog guy?  Do you know how crazy she must have thought her husband was when she walked in and he was  just looking in a fucking mirror in a bar and no liquor?  Completely drunk.  Yeah.  Slurring his words and everything.  Yeah.  All work and no play.  That's great.  Boy, was he good in this scene.  I'd love a place like that.  What a hotel.  A hotel.  Yeah.  Did they tell you, family?  I wouldn't mind.  You got a whole bar to yourself.  It's fantastic. 
[02:23:00]  There's no liquor in it.  It's wrong.  Yeah, he thinks there is.  You get drunk and you go open one of those giant cans of beans by yourself.  Yes.  Beans.  A can of beans.  One of those legs of land.  When he orders this fucking...  Can we get audio on that or no?  He orders this bourbon.  Can you go back a little bit?  When he orders the bourbon.  And, like, he just wants a drink so badly.  Yeah.  He's an alcoholic, right?  He hasn't had a drink in a while.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  Can't you, Lloyd?  You're not too busy, are you? 
[02:23:30]  No, sir.  You're not busy at all.  Laughing that he has no customers?  Thanks.  Better be a big tipper.  I'm having a slow day.  Fucking literal Lloyd.  He's obviously not busy.  And instead of laughing at the joke, he says, no, I'm not too busy.  Freaking asshole Lloyd.  Lloyd does not have a sense of humor.  No, he doesn't.  Lloyd's a stiff.  And the funny thing is, Nicholson has no money in his wallet.  None.  Zero.  Not even a buck.  Seems I'm temporarily light.  Temporarily light.  I don't want to join anyway.  Your credit's fine, Mr. Thomas. 
[02:24:00]  That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd.  I always liked you.  You were always the best of them.  Best goddamn bartender from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.  That bourbon looks great.  He certainly enjoys it, too.  When he drinks it down, he makes a face of pleasure.  Yep.  You realize how good an actor Nicholson is when he just does this.  Heaven.  The look on his face looks like I looked Friday when I had my first beer in a week. 
[02:24:30]  And he downed this icy glass of bourbon.  He is.  Look at the eyes rolling back in his head.  His eyes rolled back.  He's just.  Even the guy getting blown by the dog didn't look this happy.  Tom fucking Pop.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Yeah.  Things could be a whole lot better. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, he's feeling it already.  Oh, yeah.  He's ready to talk.  He's ready to trash this bitch upstairs.  The old sperm bank.  The old sperm bank upstairs.  One drink and he's ready to go.  Yeah, one drink and he's like, all right, where's the axe?  I'll kill both of them.  Yeah, he definitely has a problem.  Oh, boy.  What an alky.  He already broke his son's shoulder and then he tries to kill him with an axe.  Zero to 60.  What a horrible father.  Zero to 60.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:25:30]  Words of wisdom.  Words of wisdom.  Oh, just the way he turns his head to get wisdom out.  Words of wisdom.  Words of wisdom.  He's a man in a lousy jacket enjoying a drink.  Because that is a lousy coat.  Lousy coat and tight jeans.  And then Nicholson's acting out the scene how he grabbed his son, but then he temporarily  really gets into it.  I love the little son of it.  And he just, I like the explosion. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  He yanked him up.  I'd do anything.  Like he enjoyed it.  That's just how a drunk talks.  Yes.  Any fucking thing.  Yeah, just aggressive.  A shot and a half.  And he's fucking hammered.  A shot and a half.  He's ready to take down his whole family.  Long as I live.  Lloyd's thinking, I ain't gonna refill the orange juices.  Yeah.  All right.  Lloyd's thinking, I'm supposed to be the scary one in this scene.  I think I gotta bring another keg up.  The ghost didn't have to work hard on this asshole to get on the fucking killer, buddy. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  Jeez.  Even Grady took a little ribbing.  They had to fucking try to burn the place down for him to go crazy.  All the fucking Danny had to do was scatter his papers a year ago.  Lloyd stocked the entire bar like this was gonna take some time.  Yeah, exactly.  And I won half a bottle of it.  My papers all over the floor.  All I tried to do was pull it out.  Yeah.  He should just hear a Bud Light and an axe.  Right.  Get to it.  And no duels. 
[02:27:00]  And no duels.  That's all he needs.  Would you slice some rum cake, sir?  Exactly.  A rum cookie and a hammer.  Good rum cake.  The old sperm bank doesn't make it for me anymore.  Meanwhile, he doesn't want to fuck that skinny pixie that he married.  You were always the best baker, Lloyd.  Olive oil won't make it.  Olive oil.  That shit.  Fantastic, man.  That goddamn movie. 
[02:27:30]  You're right.  Like, how many fucking years ago was that?  Yeah.  It's 1980.  It's 1980.  That's 80?  1980.  Jesus.  No way.  30 years ago.  Yes, it was Bill of Bates in 79.  Wow.  30 friggin' years ago.  And I will still watch that when it's on and still be petrified at those twins.  He's standing at the end of the hallway.  Stay with us, Danny.  Yeah.  Kubrick was inspired by a photo of two little twins.  An old English photo, because they weren't in the book.  The book was actually, the book was not as scary as the film.  The book did not have the hedge maze that had hedge animals that came to life. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, they would walk.  People beat the shit out of Kubrick's version.  Stephen King.  Stephen King hated it.  Yeah.  You guys didn't like Stephen King's miniseries?  Later on, Stephen King even said he not only learned to accept it, but he enjoys it now.  Like, oh, thanks.  Oh, really?  It's fucking Kubrick, you idiot.  Yeah, you know from one scene that this is a brilliant movie.  Yeah.  And it's horrifying.  And it's scarier than the book.  I read the book.  It's scarier than the book.  Really?  Much scarier than the book.  The twins aren't in the book?  No.  That was something that a lot of that wasn't in the book. 
[02:28:30]  And what Stephen King hated was that he felt that the house, the evil of the house, was  not concentrated on and it became the craziness of Jack Torrance.  But, you know, it's a two-hour film, Steve.  Yeah.  I know.  It's hard to get a house to act.  Exactly.  You've got Jack Nicholson.  Just ask Patrice.  Oh, damn.  He didn't do anything.  I know that, but he's...  He wasn't asking for that at all.  He's my biggest friend.  Who happens to act.  Who needs to be corrected.  Corrected. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, that's another thing.  Correcting is an axe.  It's just, you chopped him up into little pieces.  There really are no just spankings.  Timeouts, really.  Maybe there's a point to timeouts.  Chopped him up with an axe.  Oh, when that woman came out of the tub.  Oh, that was so goddamn scary.  She was so sexy and comes out and then turns into a decaying...  Their hairy English 70s bush.  Old fish.  And then her skin's peeling up and she's laughing at him. 
[02:29:30]  But the funny part is, he complains about some pussy at the bar, so the house is like,  all right, this dumbbell, we know what he wants.  Throw some box out in that room.  And then scare the fuck out of him.  Chick with the hairiest vagina ever.  Cue the scary vagina.  But she was sexy, right?  Her hair was all wet and slicked back.  Yes, she was.  At that time, because I remember when I went to see that, there wasn't a lot of full frontal nudity that you could see. 
[02:30:00]  So when I saw that, it was just like, oh, look at that big hairy bush.  What could be better than a giant hairy bush?  All right, they'll be shaving him soon.  There was a time that was a turn-on, though.  Yeah.  That's right.  It's a huge turn-on.  Yeah.  Now it's like, get the fuck out of here.  I'm not going in there.  And the lady, the great part is the lady laughs at him.  Like, she's acknowledging what an old dead bag of shit she is.  Oh, yeah.  Because she's like, ha!  You kissed me!  You thought I would fuck you because I was young and hot, but I'm dead. 
[02:30:30]  You thought Lloyd was scary.  Big hairy bush.  Just to find the good part, you ought to be like Artie Johnson and laughing.  Spreading the bush apart.  Getting into this.  God, I hope Tom slips on fucking Martha Stewart and does a shining vagina reference.  This is not the good tee-up for my first cooking segment.  As he's making the lemon bundt cake.  This reminds me of when the bunny rabbit blew the man.  What?  Nothing.  Long story.  Did you ever know his ass is hanging out? 
[02:31:00]  His ass is hanging on Martha.  What are you saying?  What's going to be your move on Martha?  What are you saying?  What's going to be your cooking move?  I don't know.  I've never done one of these before.  I guess I'll just...  You've got to do something kind of wacky.  Yeah.  Like, save your dignity.  Right, exactly.  It's a balancing act.  Right, trying to maintain street cred while making a lemon cake.  Did you put, like, an apron on you?  Yeah.  A little chef hat, maybe?  Kiss the cook or something silly.  What do you do?  Mama's a little helper if you're Jake LaMotta.  Remember Jake's fucking in the whole movie? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Meanwhile, he's fucking beating her sadistically.  Maybe if I could try and hit on her while I'm doing it.  Well, she knows you're married, though.  I'll give you what you do.  Right on...  Like, what's this part of your hand where the thumb and forefinger meet, like...  It's called the meaty part.  The meaty part, yeah.  The part that really hurts when Club Soda Kenny pinches it.  You ought to draw, like, a little fucking...  A black swastika and just don't explain it.  Oh, please!  People would, like...  Mix things with that hand.  Some marriage refs are racist.  And you'd say, nah, I did it when I was 35. 
[02:32:00]  I was young and crazy.  What would be scary is that Martha's all of a sudden, like, feeling you when she sees that?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  I never...  Yes.  Yes.  When you're in commercial break, she's talking about the tats she has.  Right?  I got a swastika, white power.  Secret message received, Mr. Papa.  No more lemon cake, you're making schnitzel.  Fuck.  Do you know Martha Stewart or do you know her?  She did my show.  She was...  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  A little tit for tat.  Was she good? 
[02:32:30]  Was she going on the show?  She was really good.  She was all right?  Yeah.  She was pretty badass.  Really?  Her daughter's pretty wild.  She does a show here.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  They actually do a good show.  Yeah?  Pretty wild chick.  Yeah.  She does a show with her friend or whatever.  She married?  Martha's daughter.  You really?  Divorced into yoga.  She's into all sorts of...  She's attractive, I think.  She's kind of attractive, yes.  Yes, she is.  She doesn't...  You get...  There's...  When you're with her, you just get this feeling like, she doesn't take shit.  This woman is powerful.  Yeah, I think that's...  There is not a...  She's been in the joint.  Yeah.  Exactly.  What do you want? 
[02:33:00]  And when we were on the show, there was some...  I forget what the couple was that we were talking about, but it was something about stealing.  Oh, the guy stole soaps.  He's from the hotel.  He was like manic about stealing and stuff from the hotel.  That's crazy.  And you're there with Martha, and she's...  We're like, should we mention stealing?  Should we kind of...  And she was just right into it.  Like, yeah, one time someone came into my house and stole a pepper mill, and I drove  right up there and got it back.  She was like...  She was like gangster about it.  Why don't you tell us about your kind of stealing thing? 
[02:33:30]  You know?  She had no problem talking about anything.  She was just like, yeah, I'll talk about it.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, she...  You can't hurt me.  I mean, when she got out, and she really was kind of like reborn with a real fuck you  attitude.  Yeah.  Like, she doesn't care now at this point.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, what are you going to do to me?  I build empires.  I do time if I have to.  Rebuilt an empire after I was in the joint.  You think she has prison tattoos?  No, I'm going to make a prison tattoo.  You think she's got some prison tattoos?  She joined a gang. 
[02:34:00]  She's got a teardrop.  Teardrop!  She has to cover up with makeup when she's doing her TV show.  Giant spatula on her back.  TCB for where she killed somebody.  She has homemade prison shank.  She's coming out like De Niro and Cape Fear.  She's looking for her lawyer.  Counselor.  We learned how to make a microwave in the joint, right?  I wonder if Martha did that.  Oh, right, right.  Was it a microwave?  It was more like a Susie Bake Oven.  Bernard Hopkins told us how you make a fucking grilled cheese sandwich in the joint. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  A shoebox and tinfoil and a light bulb.  It's an Easy Bake Oven.  He figured it out, though.  Today we're going to make prison grilled cheese.  Yeah.  You know what?  That would be a great segment.  Only need some tinfoil.  She should do that.  That would be a great segment.  Yeah, great.  You got picked up.  Suggested today, Tom.  I will.  Yeah, suggest that.  I will.  I'm going to get in there.  You got picked up for season two.  Fucking hell.  How happy are you?  We do.  We got another season, yeah.  I'm just happy that I have something to talk about for another year. 
[02:35:00]  You know what I mean?  It's just another thing going on.  Obviously, you're getting recognized like crazy now because of the show.  I mean, you're pretty famous before the show hit, but now this has got to put you on a  whole other level.  It is starting up, but it's weird because you start to get recognized from people that  you don't really know.  Want to be recognized by.  Last I was here, I was telling you that I did Oprah.  Wow.  And the impact of that show is kind of, you know, like all of a sudden you're on the  plane and these, you know, 60-year-old women coming up, you were great on Oprah. 
[02:35:30]  It's like, I'm hitting my demographic.  Yeah, that's great.  You're going to see how many tickets they buy for this dress factory.  You're the lady in the tub.  Tom, if you weren't married, would you, though?  Would you?  One of these 60-year-old fans?  Yeah.  Would you?  Yeah.  One time?  Yes.  Just for the hell of it?  Yes.  For the story?  You know what's so funny is, like, I always wanted older women.  I always liked older women.  Talcum power.  But then as you get older, older women turn into old women. 
[02:36:00]  And you're still trying to get my head around it, like, well, maybe.  You know, I had that same thing growing up, and it is rougher when you get older.  You're like, fuck.  You're like, oh, man, we're talking, like, high 60s now.  I know.  Or to mean something.  That's why you really got to just turn that around.  Yeah.  You got to flip that around.  If that's your thing, though, you just change it.  Go.  Go.  About younger women.  Yeah.  How old are you, like, 38, 40 in that area?  40.  40.  Okay.  So for you, older would be, what, 50?  Or do you go into 60s?  No, you got to go higher than 50.  You got to go mid-50s.  Yeah, that's no longer.  That's older, technically, but it's not fantasy older. 
[02:36:30]  Do you think Martha's sexy?  You know, yes, I do.  Yeah.  She's doing her show.  But no, she's not a bad-looking older broad, dude.  I'm not even into older women.  She's not.  But she's not a bad-looking older woman at all.  That's not my thing.  You mix that lemon cake.  You mix it.  Yeah.  I'm a Diane Sawyer.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not a thing.  She's 60, I think, Tom.  Perfect for us.  See, I don't know.  60, 61.  No, if you're fucking born with this fetish, you're stuck with it for the rest of your life.  So I'm totally relating to Tom.  I'm more of a Dakota Fanning speed. 
[02:37:00]  You can't just get rid of that.  I know.  You're stuck with it.  Had you ever done it?  Had you ever gone old?  When I was, like, 21, I did, like, mid-30s.  I was pretty fucking wild at the time.  Yeah, that's a good leap.  And I think that's about it for me.  I never really...  It was friends' moms, like, in high school.  It was, like, friends' moms.  Oh, yeah.  And they were like, mmm.  Wow, that was so, like, not even on my radar.  Really?  Yeah, they were friends' moms.  They had no sexuality to me whatsoever.  The best is when the kid comes running into the room. 
[02:37:30]  Friends' younger sisters.  Now, that's...  But we had a couple of moms that were just, you know, working it.  And you've got to think, when you're 15, they probably were 30.  Sure.  Yeah, true.  You know, they weren't really that old.  But the best is in the morning, the kid comes running in the room, and you're like,  what the fuck?  I'm 21 years old here.  Yeah.  I saw your mom.  I popped a boner.  Did you pop a boner?  Is that what you did?  Glenn noticed his mom, when I was growing up, was big boobs.  He listens to the show, too. 
[02:38:00]  Sorry, Glenn.  He's a good friend of mine.  But we were all friends with him just to see his mom.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  You would go over there, and she would dress like she was still a teenager with these big  boobs.  She probably was.  She knew what she was doing.  She would be bringing out the snacks for everybody, bending over.  Oh, snacks!  I misheard that.  So did I.  I really gave you guys a treat.  I really wanted to pop Glenn Notice's mom bad.  Wow.  Real bad.  Yeah.  Anthony's mom, though, was the hot mom.  So it's probably natural that you're not going to like older women because your mom is pretty.  Yeah, she was the one that I...  That's right.  You were blocking that out of your head constantly. 
[02:38:30]  I had to keep my friends out of the house.  Yeah, you're like the younger woman who reminds you of your mother.  Well, let's ask you.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Did friends come over because your mom was hot?  Did you feel that vibe?  No, it's because I was a great kid.  It was fun to hang out with.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, that's what it must have been.  Yeah.  It was my mother parading around in a fucking patent leather mini skirt and go-go boots.  Did she really?  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And then I'd make it...  I was like really twisted.  When I'd go on field trips, I used to love when she would be like the field trip mother. 
[02:39:00]  There were like a couple of mothers that would come along on a field trip, like chaperone,  keep your kids in line.  We'd go to the Museum of Natural History or go see like it's a...  You're a good man, Charlie Brown in Radio City or some bullshit.  And I used to tell my mother like how to dress.  And I would say, could you put on a mini skirt and pigtails?  I'd make her put in pigtails.  What a pimp.  Yeah.  I know.  What were you thinking?  I just liked when my friends would be like, oh, your mommy's so pretty.  I'd be like, yeah, I know. 
[02:39:30]  How much?  Your parents...  Did your parents stay married the whole time?  Yeah, they're still married.  Oh, your mom?  Okay.  So your mom was like, like, what is your mom like that you kind of like older women?  Is she like, was she a hot mom or no?  She was...  No.  No.  No.  But she was...  No.  But she was...  She was...  Always looked young.  She was always young, but she wasn't...  No, she wasn't working it or...  But did you like women that looked older than her?  Yes.  Okay.  So yeah, it's the opposite of your mom.  Mm.  A lot of people like things that are opposite of my... 
[02:40:00]  Like my mom...  What was your mom?  Maybe a two.  Sorry, mom.  Maybe a three in the 60s.  His mom was not a prostitute.  So did you like older women or...  No.  No.  My girlfriend got so mad because I told her their mom was a four.  My mom was not...  You're the worst...  You say the worst things to girls.  You really do.  That's great.  But yet, if you told her she was an eight, that would be disturbing as well.  Yeah, exactly.  If I yelled out the wrong name while I was banging her, oh, your mom's name, not you. 
[02:40:30]  Six would have been safe.  Six would have been safe.  She can't really yell or scream at you.  No, I was always just into girls, like even girls from TV that you'd be like, oh, she's  cute.  You know, fantasy girls and things.  There were always girls that were around my age.  It wasn't...  Right.  Not anymore.  Right.  Long gone.  Now they have to be way younger.  You know what?  The age never changed.  But they stay the same, right?  Exactly.  The age never changed for me.  Yeah.  As I go through the years. 
[02:41:00]  You guys are just the opposite.  You both like girls in diapers, but for different reasons.  You know.  Oh, old lady.  So you're...  Lemon cake.  The thing is...  You've got to get him out of here in a few minutes.  Mix it up.  Just get a hard out to do that dumb fucking lemon cake.  You've got six minutes.  Hard out has a new meaning all of a sudden.  Hard out, yeah.  Where do you have to go for Martha's show?  Chelsea.  There's Chelsea Studios.  Ooh.  It's a nice gig.  It needs to be fucking farting around on TV.  NBC publicity is probably just getting you everywhere. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, just cruising around.  Happy to see a friend succeed.  I'll be in a suit.  Yeah, I can tell by your face again.  It's always happy to see a guy you come up with, you know.  Everything I touch just dies on the...  Everything.  You want your show off the air?  Put me on at once.  I fucking...  I really am.  I'm a fucking tsunami of failure.  Oh, Jimmy.  Where's Jerry?  Jerry is waiting for me at his office right now.  I have to go from Martha Stewart up to there to write the show for Monday.  We're taping another show on Monday. 
[02:42:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  We have Tracy Morgan, Kathy Griffin, and Nathan Lehner on tomorrow night.  I saw the Tracy Morgan clip.  It looks like it's going to be a good show.  He's hilarious.  Tracy's hilarious.  Jerry must love when you just recite Seinfeld lines from the show, right?  Oh, brutal.  He must just love that.  You know, somebody, you know, they give us couples, you know, they show us couples for  us to choose who's going to be on the show.  And these dingbat, someone dingbat casting person sent him a couple. 
[02:42:30]  It was obviously bogus where the husband's like, I don't want that in the bedroom.  She's like, I like it in the bedroom.  He's like, I want it out of here.  And then you look up above the headboard is a picture of Costanza when he was doing the  underwear ad, remember?  Yeah, when he was trying to do the sexy pictures.  The look on Jerry's face was just like, these are the people that are working with us?  You send me this?  It was just...  Was he amused?  No.  Not at all.  Not at all. 
[02:43:00]  Those casting people are indeed shit.  It's a waste of time.  Because, you know...  That's the picture.  Yeah.  You send us that.  Are you kidding?  What are you doing?  I think he hates when Colin told me that his doorman would always do like a line to Jerry.  And I'm not...  I really don't know many Seinfeld show lines.  From the episode The Doorman.  Well, I think Colin set him up, though, didn't he?  Yes, The Doorman would always say...  Like every time, you know, Jerry would come over to Colin's...  The doorman would go like, hey, soup for you, no soup for you, or whatever.  Right, right.  And Jerry just probably wants to strangle the guy. 
[02:43:30]  So Colin says to the guy, oh, he loves when you do that.  He laughs.  So every time Jerry would come over, the guy would throw some fucking horror.  He would just torture him.  I had a bad moment when my father came to the taping of the show, and I see him, like, just eyeing Seinfeld up.  You know, it's like, the show's over.  And I see my father just making a beeline, right, for Seinfeld.  I'm like, oh, no, what is he doing?  And he's got something in his hand.  I'm like, oh, no.  And he hands him a button that says, I'm back on NBC. 
[02:44:00]  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I was like, Dad.  What are you doing?  I'm trying to maintain a relationship here.  My father's like, you should wear this, Jerry.  He's like, oh, my God.  So you know, like, in Jerry's head, he's like, he's carrying some of this goofy DNA in him.  You know what I mean?  What's wrong with Papa?  He's fucking the greatest, though.  He just does not.  There's nothing phony about him. 
[02:44:30]  It's like, you would always know where you stand.  He will not give you a fake laugh.  Never.  He will not be like, oh, that's an amusing button.  He'll just look at the button and look at my father.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And just let the silence just do the work.  Permeate the air.  I want to know how many times Seinfeld has seen shame sweat break out on somebody's  forehead.  Thinking they're going to get just a big laugh from Jerry.  And what happens?  Waiting all day. 
[02:45:00]  You get a disgusted look.  And silence.  You just start breaking out in that flop sweat.  You feel it run down your side.  That's the worst.  When you feel it go from pit to waste.  One drip.  Trickling.  It's raining on your sides.  Oh, I'm bombing.  It's raining humiliation on your stupid side.  Oh, shit.  Jerry seems very uncomfortable with just a silence.  Like, he doesn't seem to need that silence filled.  No.  And other people do. 
[02:45:30]  And when an uncomfortable silence is just hanging, he just seems completely.  Yeah.  I completely fold and just start fake laughing in the middle of it.  Just make some noise.  And he can just sit there.  Basking in the silence.  Basking in it.  Yeah.  And watch you squirm.  Like putting salt on a slug.  Well, it's nice.  When you're the king and the subjects are all trying to please you, it's kind of going to  be fun to watch.  It's got to be.  They're all coming in with their fucking little, you know, the gesture shoes, trying 
[02:46:00]  to be amusing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's no act on him.  No.  It's not like, you know, hey, let me make this guy sweat.  It's just, this is who I am.  Right.  You're not making me laugh.  That's a good point.  He's not trying to do anything.  He just doesn't understand why you're trying to be funny right now.  And it is odd because the, uh, the Jerry character on the show looks like he'd be very conducive  to somebody coming up and maybe being a little funny or awkward or something.  And no, just a fun guy to be around.  Yeah.  Have you seen awkward moments with him on the road, like in the elevators or whatever? 
[02:46:30]  People trying to talk to him or not know what to say.  The elevators are the worst.  The guys that don't know enough is the bellman bringing the luggage thing up.  And they've always got some quip from the show that they want to share.  You know, and they just, uh, yada, yada, yada.  And Jerry's just like, no.  Or the worst is when, uh, he'll say something like they just, they can't handle the silence.  Like you say, and they'll just blurt something out.  Like, how was the fight? 
[02:47:00]  And the Jerry's who's heard this a zillion times just go amazing.  The most amazing.  Oh, you have no, I, this flight, the most amazing experience of my life.  And the guy doesn't know that he's being.  That he's being shit on.  Baited, right.  Good, huh?  Really?  Oh, wow.  What airline?  Yeah, that's really great.  Shut up.  Oh, it's brutal.  It's like he's just trying to just talk a little bit to get to the floor to shut the idiot bellman up.  Yeah.  I know.  But then the idiot bellman's going to go to his family and go like, yeah, I was talking with Jerry Seinfeld on the elevator today. 
[02:47:30]  No, we had a good conversation.  Then he slowly realizes, me and Corbin Bernson, we were talking.  Hasselhoff was really great.  We've got to get Tom out.  It's lemon cake time.  It's Martha Stewart.  Lemon cake.  Lemon cake.  Oh, great seeing you guys.  This was really wonderful.  Actually, we loved it, Tom.  You've got to come back.  I like coming in here.  Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey, Thursday through Saturday.  Vinny Brand.  Vinny Brand. 
[02:48:00]  732-545-4242 for tickets.  Tom Papa.  Tom's a great comic.  Hilarious.  He really is.  I might only say that because he's my friend, but Tom is a great comic.  Oh, thanks, Jimmy.  That's wonderful.  What was it?  No soup for Tom.  Oh, Jimmy.  And what time are you on Martha?  10 o'clock?  Yeah.  Okay, well, I'm going to put that on.  I'm going to see Tom just fucking.  Oh, that's funny.  We'll still be on the, yeah, please, dude, please drop something.  Please start a flash fire. 
[02:48:30]  We're going to come.  We're going to grease fire.  My signal to you will be the double boob pump.  We're going to comment as it's going down on our show.  You're going to catch a fucking beating.  I'll be in a suit, too.  Oh, no.  Yeah, da, da, da.  With a little doggy suit.  Sucking dick.  And the marriage rep is Thursday night.  What time?  10 o'clock.  All right, 10 o'clock, man.  Congratulations.  I really appreciate it.  Yeah, Tom Poppa.  We're going to go to break with a little behind-the-scenes thing with Sam Roberts. 
[02:49:00]  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  When comedian Bob Kelly was on the Opie and Anthony show, he shared with the listeners  some of the gayest songs on his iPod.  We decided to go backstage with the staff of the ONA show to find out what the gayest  songs on their iPods were.  Danny, what's the gayest song on your iPod?  I don't know.  I got to look. 
[02:49:30]  I will go with Pendulum.  You mean by the band Foundry?  They were some crappy band from the late 90s.  They just kind of ripped off like what Rob Zombie was doing.  But did it worse?  Yeah, oh, much.  Hey, E-Rock, what's the gayest song on your iPod?  Probably, oh, Foundry's Junk Man is the gayest.  Oh, it's fucking horrible.  Hey, Travis, what is the gayest song on your iPod?  What Kills Me.  What band is that by? 
[02:50:00]  I think it was Foundry.  Oh, jeez.  They had a really gay lead singer.  Fat and gay.  Butcher Ed Brock, what's the gayest song on your iPod?  That would be Bright Lights, Big City by the fat gay singer Steve Carlesi and the band Foundry.  Oh, wow.  Before we beat this into the ground, we went all the way down the hall to management and asked Rob Cross about his iPod.  Rob Cross, what's the gayest song on your iPod? 
[02:50:30]  I have Foundry's entire album.  That's your gayest song?  Well, that and the Pet Shop Boys, but I have Foundry's entire album.  The masses have spoken.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and we leave you now with our executive producer, Steve Carlesi, singing his hit, Pendulum, from his band, Foundry.  Pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day, another condescension.  Mock you, shock you, it's gonna lock you down. 
[02:51:00]  Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure.  Move too slow and the pendulum will get ya.  Show you low, yeah, it's gonna throw you around.  Backstage with ONA.  Sit very still and listen.  Yep, this is the Opie and Anthony Show on the Virus Series XM.  Opie and Anthony, that Tom Papa was real, real good, man. 
[02:51:30]  I like that guy, he's funny.  He's alright, he's gonna be on Martha Stewart.  We're gonna take a peek at 10 o'clock as he makes his lemon cake. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, God.  How intimidating must it be to have to work with Jerry, though?  He knows him really well.  Tom's weird, like people who love...  One of my favorite things is that when...  Because Eastwood, Tom does private parties for Clint Eastwood, and Clint loves him.  And when Seinfeld gets met with Clint Eastwood, he's like, yeah, yeah, Tom Papa, like they talked about Tom.  Oh, my God, imagine those two talking about you.  I just thought the hilarious part was fucking...  Seinfeld was probably a nervous Nelly meeting Eastwood.  He's fucking Eastwood.  Eastwood's not impressed with anybody.  Yeah.  And he said the same shit to Eastwood I would. 
[02:52:30]  Hey, I know Tom, too.  That's the same way I would.  Yeah, just to have something to talk about.  Yeah, there's a certain level of fame.  Like, Seinfeld is as high as you can get in famous.  But Eastwood is even beyond that.  He's legendary status.  Yeah, he's into, like, fucking iconic, you know, fucking part of the culture, you know, even beyond where Seinfeld is.  I think Jerry will be, like, in time.  Without a doubt.  Like, the whole All in the Family.  Yes. 
[02:53:00]  I Love Lucy.  Honeymooners, even.  Like, stuff like that.  I think Seinfeld will fall into that category in years to come.  Yeah, it already is.  That famous.  I think he's getting close to that already.  I'm saying you just need a 30-year, like, because he's had 30 or 40 years.  But he already has 10 years under his belt, right?  How many years ago did that Seinfeld go off the air?  More than 10 now?  Fucking show started in, like, 89.  I guess you're right.  So he's got 21 years under his belt.  And he was kind of famous before then, too.  No, he wasn't.  I saw a Tonight Show recently he did with Carson when he was plugging his first, plugging it as a show. 
[02:53:30]  HBO, I think.  Oh, it's a TV show.  Yeah, your new shows, you know, and he's very proud.  Now, I saw Jerry Seinfeld when I was doing radio in Rochester, New York.  We were just up there, Jimmy.  19, I would guess, 88.  Yuck, yucks.  There's a lot of yuck, yucks up in the Rochester, Buffalo, Canada area.  Do you just mean the girls?  Well, yeah.  Sorry, ladies.  I'm teasing, of course.  And I was in the front row because I worked for the station.  And there's Jerry Seinfeld. 
[02:54:00]  Ooh.  Yeah.  How was he?  He was good, right?  It could have been more than 200 people, probably less.  He was unbelievable.  Well, if you remember, before the show, though, he was a comic that you'd see on HBO every so often,  or one of those, he was on the Young Comedian special, one of Rodney's Young Comedian things.  Killed.  Did a great job.  Who was he on with?  You remember?  That's a good trivia question.  Yeah, he was, oh, God.  Oh, is this the Carson?  Good job, man.  Tomorrow night at 9.30 on NBC, following the very popular show Cheers,  is another very popular young guy, very funny guy, Jerry Seinfeld. 
[02:54:30]  Holy shit, Carson.  With his own show called The Seinfeld Chronicles.  That's how far he goes with the Orphan Theater in the Seinfeld Chronicles.  At the Circles.  Yeah, hooray.  Thank you.  Fucking Johnny.  The master.  He'll be coming at pep rally all of a sudden.  He will be in Minneapolis, dear, June night, and he'll be at the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos also.  No cheers for San Carlos, huh?  On June 23rd.  Would you welcome Jerry Seinfeld?  There's never been anybody better at this job.  His first appearance on that one? 
[02:55:00]  No, many, many appearances.  That was just plugging his show.  Oh, he gets to sit right down.  Called The Seinfeld Chronicles.  He's to the sitting down stage.  How young he is, man.  Obviously, there's a lady from Minneapolis who's going to come see you.  We've got a big, big guy from Minneapolis.  All right.  That's only need another 999 people.  Yeah, so.  Sold out.  Tomorrow night's the big night.  Yeah, tomorrow night.  I can't believe it.  How about this?  Prime time, NBC?  How did this all happen?  Five years ago, would you have thought, hey, that's going to happen?  No, no.  I've been doing this show for 10 years. 
[02:55:30]  I guess so.  What?  Jesus Christ.  It's really a big thrill.  I'd like to thank you, actually, for, you know.  76, you started your holiday.  For a long time, this is all I was doing, was this show and the little clubs, and that's  a really exciting break.  Lucy's just kind of a little nighttime throwaway.  Now you're in the big time.  Wow.  Now, you set the show in, the setting is New York, right?  It's in New York, which is where I live some of the time.  But how great of an interviewer, I don't talk about it, but how great of an interviewer  is Carson?  Oh, yeah.  People's radio are in the car a lot, so they have these no radio signs. 
[02:56:00]  Have you seen this?  I've heard about it.  No radio.  I've also seen no radio, nothing in trunk, because they're breaking into the trunks.  No radio, no nothing.  This is one absolutely true.  I saw this.  No radio, thank you.  No radio, thank you.  You're going to attempt being polite to the crew.  Now, it's in, you know, sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Crack Addict, sir.  Jesus.  That's a fucking chilling Johnny.  Crack that your consideration in this matter.  Maybe they can put a sign out there, this is not a car, or something like that. 
[02:56:30]  But they really do.  No radio.  Johnny really liked them, man.  Johnny was the fucking...  Didn't they have it on some new cars, if you'd take the radio out, it's in an operative.  Yeah.  Some manufacturers have done that.  I don't know whether they're for real, but that's what they tell you.  I've lost probably about eight, ten of these things.  I would like once to just steal the car and leave the radio in the parking lot.  Just to break it up a little, you know.  I love when they have criminals on TV, especially these really wild, like the, you know, they  have a terrorist or a mass murderer.  The guy's always covering up his face.  You ever notice this when he's, when they're hauling him in? 
[02:57:00]  Of course.  But what is this man's reputation that he has to worry about protecting it?  I mean, what is he, a big job promotion?  That's pretty fucking funny, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're afraid the boss is going to catch it and go, isn't that Johnson from sales?  What I always like when you have somebody like that, as terrible as it is, somebody goes berserk  and wipes out, they always interview the neighbors.  Yeah.  And what do they always say?  He was kind of a loner. 
[02:57:30]  He was kind of a loner.  Oh, he's kind of quiet, kept by himself.  Now you know why.  But he's firing a lot.  He's right there.  He's firing a lot.  So, but when you're, you know, firing, I think it's hard for people to get to know you.  That's about 10 minutes.  I know, really.  That's material, though.  I love watching, I love watching the old Johnnies because just watching this guy fucking interview  people, it's like, you don't realize that they probably knew most of what Jerry was going 
[02:58:00]  to talk about just for setups and the time.  Right, right, right.  Like, I think the guys that would never say what they were going to talk about are guys  like Rickles, Rodney, like just machines like that.  Sinatra.  No, I mean comedians.  Like guys, they do that just so they know where you're going and how to set you up.  And Rodney would just, you know, he's a fucking, you know, would just go out there with a  machete and just fucking, you know.  So, so he didn't need any type of help, but, uh, you know, you don't realize that Johnny  knew where he was going.  You know what it is?  You didn't, you didn't get this, um, this breakup of here. 
[02:58:30]  We're talking about this, this, this, like everything flowed into it.  You know, I haven't watched a Johnny clip in quite a while.  You watch talk show hosts now, which, you know, time a dozen, there's a lot of fucking  talk shows on right now.  You realize why he was on so long and so successful.  That motherfucker just knew how to sit and talk with people every goddamn night.  And when he would bomb doing the monologue.  Oh yeah.  There was nothing.  Danny, is there any, I don't even know if they've been yanked, any Carson bombing lines? 
[02:59:00]  Cause he was legendary for when a monologue would fucking shit the bed.  Yeah.  And it would sometimes just shit the bed.  He wouldn't panic.  He would just go with it.  No.  Yeah.  Well, I remember one of his lines once when I was a kid, he used to, I don't remember  what the reference was, but he said somebody was doing the polka with Phyllis Schaftly.  And I don't know why that made me laugh harder than almost anything I'd heard as a child.  Jesus Christ.  Cause I didn't know who Phyllis Schaftly was, but I knew she was a cunt. 
[02:59:30]  Okay.  85.  I'm going to get swinging in a moment here.  What else happened?  Oh, Margaret Thatcher is not in town.  She actually is in Washington and, uh, with meetings and a reporter asked her what the biggest  contribution, the Great Britain has made.  And she said, and she said, deporting Robin Leach.  Oh, God.  Oh.  It's in the microphone.  It's in the microphone.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow, did that bomb. 
[03:00:00]  His little shoulders did a shrug.  Look at him.  He's like, wow.  He just said, wow.  Did he say wow?  Yeah.  That was a bomb.  Holy shit.  There was nothing better than a good fucking Carson fucking zero.  Oh, he acknowledged it.  Didn't try to move on.  His shoulders went up.  Yeah, his shoulders went up and he went like, he made an eek face.  He would actually, uh, he would tap dance once in a while when the whole monologue was 
[03:00:30]  eating it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He would just start tap dancing.  The music would play like, da-doon.  I haven't seen it in 25 years.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  He'd start tap dancing.  That was his way of letting the audience know, we realize that we are bombing.  But that writer got a fucking little talking to.  Well, he just knew how to make it funny.  Bombing should be acknowledged more because there is something.  It's natural and it is funny. 
[03:01:00]  We can move on from the cars and stuff.  People have some calls, but what the hell.  We got a Mike Francesa prank call that's really squeezing in before we get out of here today.  Someone got through to Francesa?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, did they?  Oh, boy.  He does sports talk here in New York City without the mad dog.  He's got no sense of humor.  We got the mad dog.  Nah, he's a dry douche.  He really sucks.  He's an oxymoron.  Coach Parcells.  Shut up.  The coach.  The coach, I say, coach. 
[03:01:30]  Shut up.  Did you say that?  Yeah, well, he got.  Big fathead.  Someone got him good.  Listen to this.  You're going to love this.  You're going to love this.  Joe in North Bergen.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  Good, thanks.  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  Good, thanks.  I had two quick points.  First thing I can say, you did a phenomenal job covering the NCAA tournament last week.  Not making you cover it all, but alone as well as you did.  Well, thank you.  Well, thank you.  Secondly, what do you think the chances are that O.J. Reyes has the biggest cock in the 
[03:02:00]  clock room?  Well, you see, here's the thing I try to tell you guys.  And this is why he's a fucking douche, by the way.  You can't even go with it a little bit.  Obviously, they beeped that out on regular radio, but you can't laugh over that.  The best part is the guy laughing during his own joke.  What a fucking douchebag that he can't even go with that.  Did that get out?  Was that live?  Well, there's like an internet feed.  Yeah.  A lot of the radio stations on Terrestrial now, they have a web stream, and the web stream 
[03:02:30]  isn't affected by the dump.  So you could get the...  That's funny.  But why can't the guy go with it a little bit?  Holy shit.  Pause, pause, pause.  Well, you see, here's the thing I try to tell you guys.  When you call up and you try to do something stupid, like curse or something like that,  or try to get something like that through, you can't get it through.  You can't do it.  Oh, really?  So we're on a delay for that reason, so that knuckleheads don't do stuff like that.  And if you do, you don't get away with it anyway. 
[03:03:00]  So it's not a big deal.  So you don't worry about it.  It doesn't work, though.  You can't do it.  It's impossible.  It just never gets on the air.  So it just, you know, you might think you wait to do something like that, and you're  thrilling your friends, but it just doesn't work.  Let it go, Mike.  I know you try to do it, but it just doesn't work.  Let it go.  I know how he says it's impossible.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  And we got to play the call for everybody today.  And we have a pretty fucking big audience, stupid Mike.  Can we hear the laugh again?  I want to hear him laugh.  The guy telling the fucking thing was very funny.  And keep in mind, Mike goes, it doesn't work, so don't bother. 
[03:03:30]  Really?  That's only going to make more people do this now, Mikey.  Joe in North Bergen.  What's up, Joe?  I want the whole thing again.  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  Good, thanks.  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  Good, thanks.  I had two quick points.  First, I'd like to say, you did a phenomenal job covering the NCAA tournament last week.  Not making you cover it all, let alone as well as you did.  Well, thank you.  Second, what do you think the chances are that O.J. Reyes has the biggest cock in the clock?  Well, you see, here's the thing I'm trying to tell you guys. 
[03:04:00]  I cracked him, it's all up.  He just couldn't get it out.  He cracked himself up.  Wouldn't it be great if he just goes, well, you see, and then started to answer his question  about why he probably doesn't have the biggest cock.  But for him to say it's impossible to get it through, he just proved it's not impossible.  Oh, wow.  That is funny.  That's pretty good, right?  It's a great question.  I'd love an answer to that.  Yeah, really?  What are the odds?  What are the odds?  It's like there's going to be odds of how big Jose Reyes' cock is compared to other 
[03:04:30]  men.  What are the odds?  If someone has laid down odds of what that might be.  You think this is a Vegas line?  What are the odds?  Soccer.  We all love soccer.  No, we don't.  As Americans, we hate the goddamn, hate the goddamn sport.  Oh, great.  You feel the fucking calls.  Sorry.  You're going to be pissing off soccer fans now.  Fuck the soccer fans.  Soccer reporter has no idea what the fuck is going on during a little game of soccer.  Check this out.  Put Oldham in front against Gillingham. 
[03:05:00]  It's a loan from Doncaster Rovers, and Doncaster themselves have scored against Plymouth.  They're on the brink of the playoffs at the moment, and James Coppinger has got that  goal.  And we're off to Fratton Park, where there's been a red card.  But for who, Chris Kamara?  I don't know, Geoff, has it?  I must have missed that.  It's a red card.  Chris!  Have you not been watching?  I haven't.  I don't know where that's come from, Chris.  I have no idea what has happened there.  What's happened, Chris? 
[03:05:30]  I don't know, Geoff.  I don't know.  The rain must have got in my eyes, Geoff.  Chris.  But, Chris, Chris, let me tell you, according to our sources, Anthony van den Boer has been  sent off for a second bookable offence.  Get your fingers out and count up the number of Portsmouth players who are on the field.  No, you're right.  I saw him go off, but I thought they were bringing a sub on Geoff. 
[03:06:00]  That's professionalism, I can't believe.  Still nil nil.  Cussing edge reports on Gillette's soccer Saturday.  What's the bar like?  No substitute.  And obviously, he's the sideline reporter.  He's sitting there.  That's fucking funny.  That's his whole job is to fucking...  I don't know.  I don't know.  The accent makes it even better, right?  They all just laugh at him.  Always.  Which is foreign reporter...  Okay, foreign woman...  What happened?  Foreign woman reporter gets hit by a soccer ball.  You get hit by a soccer ball.  I just want to see a woman get hit by a ball. 
[03:06:30]  It looks fake.  I just kind of barely hit her.  I know they got to show it in slow motion 80 times.  Ow.  It looks fake.  But for who, Chris Gamara?  I don't know, Geoff, has it?  I don't know, Geoff.  I must have missed that.  Red card?  Penny?  Chris!  A red card? 
[03:07:00]  That is a good find, boys.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Chris is just doing nothing.  Oh.  The Nixon tapes, Anthony.  Gosh.  Yeah, we were talking about this earlier, man.  Oh, my God.  Do we have Gimme Shelter?  Got to go old school for the kids that linger longer with us.  This Richard Nixon.  Because, yeah, a lot's come up lately,  especially on this very program about race and stuff like that.  Wow.  Richard Nixon.  He had some racial issues, I think. 
[03:07:30]  You don't even have to say, I think, at this point.  No, he did.  It's pretty fucking obvious.  Back in, I guess, 1971, he was talking to John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman.  My boys.  Hold on.  What you're about to hear is real.  We're not doing a bit.  Oh, yeah.  This is fucking Nixon just speaking his mind back in 71.  And, of course, Nixon loved taping things.  He was the first guy to really put tape recorders everywhere in the White House. 
[03:08:00]  JFK did it, too, but they removed them when he died.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Bobby had them taken out.  JFK did them as well.  Yeah, see?  No one cared about Nixon enough to take them out.  He left all of them in there and saved the tapes.  Did no one notice those big, clunky fucking tape recorders?  Big, giant tape recorders.  Everywhere.  Don't mind the spinning wheels.  They've got to go round.  Yeah, yeah.  This thing about taping shit and not erasing it.  He saved them.  Thank God he saved them.  You know how, like, serial killers save things? 
[03:08:30]  Trophies.  They're called trophies.  Yeah, he felt that way about his audio tapes.  He wouldn't let them go.  And he said things that were a little racy.  We've done some things in the past about the Jews.  He never really liked the Jews.  Well, there's a few things about blacks.  I'm sorry, but Denny has found the old school fucking tape recorders.  Yeah, look at that recorder.  Where was that stash?  It's like as big as the wheels on your car.  It's giant. 
[03:09:00]  And now it's just on our stupid phones.  Rewind 80 feet.  I want to hear the last word I said.  What year was that?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Sorry.  Those are giant.  No, that's hysterical.  They're giant.  But he was talking about black people.  And this is what he was saying to John Ehrlichman.  I guess he was upset about welfare.  Welfare programs. 
[03:09:30]  He goes, we're going to put more of these little Negro bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family?  Let people like Pat Moynihan and Leonard Garnett and others believe all that crap, but I don't believe it.  It won't work.  Let them work.  Work.  Throw them off the rolls.  That's the key.  That's the key.  And then, of course, Ehrlichman is just sitting there going, the key is Reagan's neutrality. 
[03:10:00]  If Reagan blasts this thing and says it's not strong enough on the work requirement end, that will be very bad.  And Nixon goes, I have the greatest affection for the blacks.  The greatest affection for the blacks.  But I know they're not going to make it for 500 years.  They aren't.  You know it too.  The Mexicans, they're a different cup of tea. 
[03:10:30]  They have a heritage.  At the present time, they steal.  They're dishonest.  But they do have some concept of family life.  I don't like, they don't like, live like a bunch of dogs, like the Negroes do.  This was the president of the United States, Richard Nixon.  And then Ehrlichman says, the Mexican-American is not as good as the Mexican.  You go down to Mexico, they're clean, they're honest, they're moral. 
[03:11:00]  And Nixon goes, Mexico is a much more moral country.  And then Ehrlichman, Monterey, go into the slum areas.  And by God, they come out with clean shirts on on Sunday morning.  The church, you find a hell of a lot less marijuana use in Mexico than the United States.  And then they go into talking about the unions for some reason.  But Nixon then turns to the homosexuals. 
[03:11:30]  Talking about how CBS, he says, is glorifying homosexuality.  And Ehrlichman goes, what, a panel show?  He goes, no, no, no, no.  It's a regular show.  This is Haldeman.  A regular show.  It's on every week.  I guess they're talking about All in the Family at this point.  Or is it soap?  No, they were talking about All in the Family.  Because he's talking about how it's a hard hat.  Talking about Archie Bunker being a hard hat kind of a guy.  He goes, Ehrlichman said he always looks like a slob. 
[03:12:00]  And Nixon goes, hey, he looks like Jackie Gleason.  He's talking about Carol O'Connor.  Oh, right, right, right.  And Haldeman says he has a hippie son-in-law.  And usually the general trend is to downgrade him and upgrade the son-in-law.  Make the square hard hat out to be the bad guy.  But a few weeks ago they had one which the guy, the son-in-law, wrote a letter to Nixon  to raise hell about something.  And the guy said, you will not write that letter from my home. 
[03:12:30]  That was Archie Bunker apparently saying that.  Then said, I'm going to write President Nixon.  Took off all his sloppy clothes, shaved, and went to a desk to get ready to write his letter  to President Nixon.  And apparently it was a good episode.  And it says, what's it called?  And then Nixon gets going again.  Archie's Guys.  He thought the show was called Archie's Guys.  What a dummy.  There he goes.  Archie's sitting here with his hippie son-in-law, married to his screwball daughter. 
[03:13:00]  This is Nixon doing pretty much a review on all the family.  The son-in-law apparently goes both ways.  This guy, he's obviously queer.  No, I think this is the episode, though, where Meathead's friend is gay and comes in, and  he's a gay guy, flamboyant, wearing a pocketbook and an ascot and shit like that.  And it's also the one where later on turns out that Archie's friend, who was a football 
[03:13:30]  player guy, turned out to be gay and told Archie he was gay and Archie didn't believe  it or some shit like that.  And that's the episode he's talking about.  He's obviously queer, wears an ascot, but not offensively so, very clever, uses nice  language, shows pictures of his parents.  And so Arch goes down to the bar, sees his best friend, who used to play professional  football, virile, strong, this and that. 
[03:14:00]  Then the fairy comes into the bar.  I don't mind the homosexuality.  I understand it.  Nevertheless, God damn, I don't think you should glorify it on public television.  Homosexuality, even more than glorifying whores.  They're glorifying homosexuality.  We all know we have weakness, but God damn it.  When do you think that?  What do you think that does to kids? 
[03:14:30]  You know what happened to the Greeks?  Homosexuality destroyed them.  Sure, Aristotle was a homo.  We all know that.  So was Socrates.  That's unbelievable.  He's talking about, and this is just, and Ehrlichman and Haldeman had to sit here and  entertain this guy before he, you know, ended up having them sent to prison.  You know what happened to the Romans?  The last six Roman emperors were fags.  Neither in a public way.  You know what happened to the Pope? 
[03:15:00]  They were laying the nuns.  That's been going on for centuries.  But the Catholic Church went to hell three or four centuries ago.  It was homosexual.  And how to be cleaned out.  That's what happened to Britain.  Happened earlier in France.  Apparently to Nixon, everyone was gay.  Look at the strong societies, the Russians.  Goddamn, they root them out.  They don't let them hang around.  I don't know what they did with them. 
[03:15:30]  Look at this country.  You think the Russians allow dope homosexuality?  Dope immorality?  They're the enemies of society.  And that's why communists and left-wingers are clinging to one another.  They're destroying us.  I know Moynihan will disagree.  And so will Mitchell.  And Garment.  But goddammit, we have to stand up to this.  It's fatal liberality. 
[03:16:00]  Ehrlichman says.  And Nixon just goes, huh?  At this point, he's just on a tear.  We know what happened in Northern California.  San Francisco has just gone clear over.  But not just in a ratty part of town, either.  The upper class San Francisco is that way.  The Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time to time.  It is the most faggy goddamn thing you could imagine.  I can't shake hands with anybody from San Francisco. 
[03:16:30]  They gotta do something.  But we don't have to glorify it.  Designers taking it out on women.  Now they're trying to get them to wear sexy things coming on again.  And Ehrlichman says, like, hot pants.  And Nixon just goes, Jesus Christ.  Hot pants.  Jesus Christ.  That's where it ends.  That's some of the great, great audio tapes. 
[03:17:00]  I would love to hear them.  There was really bad quality, though.  They had to be transcribed.  God, to hear great clear tapes of Nixon just losing his mind like that.  I know.  And he would have his staff, Ehrlichman and Haldeman and what's his name?  Secretary of State fucking Henry Kissinger just sitting there and having to go, yeah, sure.  And, you know, they must have been talking to each other like, so you got to hang out with that nut today? 
[03:17:30]  That fucking kook?  Ehrlichman.  Unbelievable.  Tell him it was you.  You won't have tricky Nixon.  Tricky Dick Nixon to kick around anymore.  You queers.  Or you Negroes.  Or the Jew.  He was, uh, he was something.  He was quite the card.  Imagine you fucking, like, found out about what she, like, modern presidents are saying behind closed doors.  That ain't happening anymore, right?  You don't think it's happening? 
[03:18:00]  I bet they're saying it.  Every once in a while there's a slight slip up, but, yeah, of course they're saying shit.  You think there's the presidential room where, you know, George W. could just go in there and fucking yell the N-word?  Of course.  Shit like that.  He's a human being.  I think Obama's got a room.  You could just bitch about fucking Republicans and Tea Party people.  Of course.  Crawl on them crackers.  They just keep it real safe now.  Crack-ass motherfuckers!  All right, listen, we should take a break so we could see Tom Papa making a dumb lemon cake on the Martha Stewart show.  I want to see how...  I think she's a dyke. 
[03:18:30]  I want to see how good this Tom Papa is to make it entertaining for Martha Stewart's audience.  Right?  Yeah, when is that on?  In a few minutes.  In a near break, we'll come back with that, hopefully.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, we're not going to see Tom Papa doing the lemon cake thing with Martha Stewart.  Now, why is that?  We don't get the Hallmark Channel.  We don't?  Oh, well.  What cable system is this? 
[03:19:00]  I don't know.  Must not be Fios.  I don't know.  Sound Garden.  All right, all right, all right.  Have an open mind here, Ant.  Uh-huh.  This is Lollapalooza.  If you say it's Sound Garden without Chris Cornell...  Hell no, they're back doing their thing.  All right.  I thought you were going to say we'll have an open mind with the new singer.  I follow Chris Cornell on Twitter.  The fucking guy got back together with his boys, and I'm very excited.  Sound Garden is back doing their thing, Ant, and they're going to be doing Lollapalooza with Green Day. 
[03:19:30]  Wow.  Time Machine.  And Lady Gaga.  What?  Come on, this Lady Gaga.  Get a dumb fucking...  Get rid of this bitch.  Enough of her.  She's got a fucking monster album with a lot of hits.  She's fucking infecting everything.  Enough with stupid Lady Gaga.  I'm just thinking as far as a music festival goes, Sound Garden, Lady Gaga, Green Day. 
[03:20:00]  Hmm.  Oh, my God.  Hmm.  Enough.  You know what?  I don't want to see Green Day.  No.  I don't want to see Green Day.  I want to see Sound Garden.  Have you seen commercials for that American idiot on Broadway?  I sure did, Danny.  I sure did.  It looks horrendous.  Don't you have the douchiest chills?  Yes, of course.  And I have a friend of mine.  Why don't they do it the right way, and the band just says, you know what, we're going  to go do Broadway for a little while.  Instead of they casted the band.  Yeah.  So, you're not seeing Green Day on Broadway. 
[03:20:30]  You're seeing, like, some guy doing a bad show impression.  You're seeing a tribute band.  A tribute band.  A friend of mine who enjoys Green Day a lot went to see it, and I was just like, oh, I  don't think you're going to like it.  It looks really douchey.  And then she told me the day after, she's like, yeah, you were right.  It was bad.  That thing will not survive, man.  I mean, when I saw it, the first time I saw it, I think they did, like, a little bit  on the Grammys, I think.  And I saw it, and I was like, oh, no.  Yeah, they did a song on the Grammys.  There's a whole thing going on with, like, Broadway thinking that everything can be like 
[03:21:00]  Jersey Boys, which is the story of fucking Frankie Valli or some bullshit.  Who is it?  I don't know.  Who the fuck is it?  It doesn't matter.  Who the hell knows?  Your point matters, but that part of it doesn't matter.  But they think, like, they did that, and it worked.  It, like, you know, people came in, and they think now that they could just do it.  I could see the meeting.  You know, we can probably update it a little and get the younger people in. 
[03:21:30]  If we do it with the Four Seasons, that's what I want to say.  They should just get the band.  Fucking live in New York for six months and do it properly.  Or how about a punk band doesn't put on a Broadway show?  Well, exactly.  How about that?  But if you're going to do it, you should commit and do it yourself.  How about that?  Are they a punk band, Green Jay?  Well, they used to be.  I mean, they're early stuff.  They started out on Epitaph Records.  Come on.  You could probably do, like, a Sid Vicious thing on Broadway. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, I bet you probably could.  You know, that's enough time has gone by.  What about G.G. Allen on Broadway?  Like, the guy who threw fake through it.  There's a number called Eating Duty.  What a fucking lunatic.  And have it done, like, a cheesy musical where it's like,  I am throwing my shit at you.  The playbill has, like, brown smears on it.  Fucking disgusting.  So there you go.  He's got a banana in his ass.  Banana in his ass.  Whole fucking troop comes out singing. 
[03:22:30]  Dresses bananas.  Yeah, they're dressed like bananas going back and forth.  I'm squatting.  He's squatting.  He's beating up the audience.  Beating up the audience.  Because he can sing.  Big ending bananas in our ass.  Curtain comes down.  Everyone claps.  Last Broadway thing I went to see was that Bronx tale.  Yeah.  With Chaz.  Yeah, that was the last time I went, man.  And it was great.  Was that off? 
[03:23:00]  No, it was on Broadway, man.  His name is actually pronounced Chaz.  Chaz.  Chaz.  Chaz.  Chaz.  Chaz.  Chaz.  A Bronx tale.  Chaz.  So we got that.  Oh, weepings.  I'm sure.  Who else is on Lollapalooza?  There's probably other bands.  Frank Zappa.  I didn't even know.  You got the lineup.  I didn't even know there was Lollapalooza.  It's a three-day festival.  All right.  Give me a few more that we know, though.  Don't Lie or I'll Know.  Arcade Fire.  Nice.  The Strokes.  You like the Arcade Fire?  Don't know. 
[03:23:30]  You know, they're great.  I like the idea of one in real life.  Yeah, really?  A bunch of dumb teenagers being scalded.  Somebody trying to set a record on asteroids burning.  I resent the implication.  Ha ha ha.  Linger B.  Yeah, hey.  You owe me an apology, Senator.  Senator.  The Strokes.  As people kill them, I'm an apology.  I can't write.  Social distortion.  Spoon.  Devo.  Cypress Hill.  Devo?  Erga Badu.  Ugh.  Nothing.  How the fuck is this?  Any other fucking bands pop out at you? 
[03:24:00]  We're looking at Lollapalooza.  Wolf Mother.  MGMT's playing.  Where?  At Lollapalooza.  No, where are they on the list?  Oh, right there.  Nice.  Who gives a shit about Lollapalooza?  Wolf Mother.  Wolf Mother.  Nice.  Blues Traveler.  What?  Really kind of, the names start getting smaller and smaller.  Yeah, that's not a good sign.  It's like an eye chart.  We don't like fuck buttons?  Well.  Who doesn't?  Yeah, who doesn't like a fuck button?  Come on.  Yeah.  That's not good for the bands that are in smaller writing.  It starts out with real big writing when you see Soundgarden, Green Day, and Lady Gaga. 
[03:24:30]  And then the second line just as big, and then it just starts getting smaller and smaller.  Fucking Lady Gaga.  Can we just fucking not deal with her?  Ba-da-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga.  Being on, like, why is she at Lollapalooza with Soundgarden and even Green Day?  I understand the problem with Green Day.  It's a fantastic festival.  Oh, stop.  It's got to include everyone.  Selling out.  Just selling out.  Man.  It's Perry Farrell.  What do you expect?  Lady Gaga.  We're going to Lollapalooza, man. 
[03:25:00]  Stop with her.  You think it's going to be a green festival?  With her stupid space suits and a giant clit.  Can we play Kenny's version of...  No.  You don't like Lady Gaga?  No.  Hit that fucking Club Soda Kenny.  Will she be around for, like, fucking...  I'll give her, like, two years.  I think you're wrong.  I think you're wrong, too.  Just because, dude, she's got so many massive hits.  I know she is, but there's been fucking people that have had huge hits and then they're gone. 
[03:25:30]  Well, like, Kesha's going to be gone.  She's the type of person you're talking about.  This Lady Gaga is very talented.  The problem she's doing, the wild costumes, this is my prediction on the Lady Gaga.  She did that to get exposure, get her name out there at first.  She's going to fucking blow all that shit off and just be a great pop singer.  Oh, yeah.  Or she's going to tone it way down.  Look at Madonna.  Way down.  She's stuck around.  She's doing a lot of Madonna-type songs, too, right?  I'm trying to think of why it's different, but... 
[03:26:00]  You know what I mean?  You just got to change your...  Look, you don't like the Kermit the Frog suit?  Let me see your face.  I want to fucking smash that Kermit head.  Does that bother you, man?  It bugs the shit out of me.  Would you take a baseball bat to all those frogs she's wearing?  It bothers me.  Why?  She's Lady Gaga.  The name Lady Gaga.  What does that even mean?  She's a big baby.  What is she doing with that black man?  People go Gaga over her clit.  Is that it?  It should mean.  I like that fucking meaty clit.  Here's Club Soda Kenny doing his Lady Gaga impression. 
[03:26:30]  Is it?  I love this.  I want you ugly.  I want you disease.  I want you everything as long as it's free.  I want your love.  Love, love.  Love, love, love.  I want your love.  I want your drum of the touch of your hand.  I want your leather studded kiss in the sand.  I want your love.  It's terrible. 
[03:27:00]  Love, love, love.  I want your love.  You know that I want you.  I want your head resting on your back after decapitation.  His or hers?  Kenny's.  Look at it.  Flat ass in his slacks.  Oh, with his tucked in white shirt.  He looks like Michael Madsen about to slice an ear off.  I should be dancing with a fucking ear and a straight razor.  Get him.  What's in his back pocket? 
[03:27:30]  I don't know.  Traffic is sort of in life, stupidity.  The slacks.  They're pulled up very high, too.  Oh, fuck.  That's the best part.  Why would you fade that out?  I hate.  You don't like this stuff.  How can you?  No, I don't like it. 
[03:28:00]  Awful.  Is she even fuckable?  I can't tell.  I can't tell from pictures.  I'd eat her before I fuck her.  Some pictures look all right.  Others look like I don't know what.  I'm with you.  Not fuckable.  You're nuts.  You guys look crazy.  No, no, I don't know.  The jury's out.  I'm going not.  You guys are nuts.  Let me see that.  Sometimes she takes a good picture.  See, look, that doesn't look bad.  She kind of has some kind of weird, kind of cool look there.  If she's sweated and just put that big fucking clit on my face.  After an entire show. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  After the encore.  Yeah.  She just comes right in the back.  You're waiting there, sitting with your head on the couch.  Yep.  And she just squats on your face.  Her pussy probably looks like a mouth after Brock Lesnar punched it.  How much would you love that, Jeremy?  I would love her pussy to spill out.  It would be like an embarrassing.  Just all over your face?  Yeah, like another leg.  I bet you when she was in the womb, they almost aborted her because they thought it was another leg.  That's how big I want her clit to be.  Let me see her ass and legs. 
[03:29:00]  Let's see if they look any good.  Lady Gaga ass.  All right.  There we go.  Let's look at her ass and get a little view here.  Let's see.  Blow that up.  That's a nice ass.  All right.  Yeah.  What's wrong with the ass?  I got to give it to her there.  She's wearing some fishnets.  It looks pretty good.  Let's go to picture number two.  Can we go, Lady Gaga?  That's a nice ass.  Would you let her drop a little stinker on your nose?  No stinkers.  A little fart?  I would like a clean hindquarter. 
[03:29:30]  Boo.  Can I try one?  Lady Gaga elbow.  Why?  What's wrong with her elbow?  I just want to make sure it's okay.  She doesn't have eczema.  Eczema, seborrhea.  The elbow doesn't get the attention it deserves.  There's an elbow, but you can't really see it.  Can't see if it's a sexy elbow?  All right.  You try one, Jimmy.  Lady Gaga.  Hemorrhoids.  No, Lady Gaga ziggy nose clit.  Let's try ziggy nose clit. 
[03:30:00]  What is that?  You ever see Ziggy and he hangs over the fence?  Big nose, the cartoon.  It's Kilroy.  You always get that wrong.  Kilroy, right.  Do I?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  One of his pails.  Who's Ziggy?  Ziggy's the little comic.  Ziggy's the comic.  I mean the comic.  You're thinking of this.  Oh, yeah.  Which one?  No, not which one.  Which one is Ziggy?  That's a Ziggy.  I think you're right.  I think Danny's right on this.  Jerry would laugh if I said that.  Maybe he is.  I don't know.  That's Ziggy.  See, Ziggy's got a...  Ziggy never hung over the fence.  That was Kilroy. 
[03:30:30]  Ziggy's got a big clit-like nose, but he never hung over the fence like Kilroy did.  Kilroy was what the American soldiers used to paint after they ravaged a town.  They painted on a wall or a fence or something and said Kilroy was here.  Wow, that's kind of twisted.  Yeah.  And there were many versions of the Kilroy?  Yeah, you know, a lot of different people were doing it after they, you know...  Why'd they do that?  Machine gunned down some people.  Just to make it hurt.  Because it was war, goddammit.  Just to make it hurt a little more.  Yeah.  Ace of Spades!  Big Lady Gaga clit! 
[03:31:00]  Kilroy!  Death cards!  Woman with a clit that big could drink out of my hog anytime!  He drank patty water.  That was the fucking Vietnamese guy's big improv.  He drinks patty water.  Patty water!  That's the big insult in Vietnam.  Your stomach is hanging out, you drink patty water.  Patty water.  Linda Might.  I'm a big clit fan.  Is that Lady Gaga's fucking meat pussy?  Is that it?  Look up Linda Might.  She's an old lady, but she has a fucking massive clit. 
[03:31:30]  She used to have a big sight.  I used to belong to it.  Linda M-I-G-H-T.  Linda Might.  What a good egg.  Oh, fuck.  That's a cock.  Stop being such a cock.  Stop being so judgmental.  Judgmental.  What are you mean-spirited for?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's Linda Might's big clit.  You're gay if you're sucking on that.  No, you're not.  You're a homo.  You're a homo.  It's not at all.  She had a giant clit, Haldeman.  A giant clit.  She's got a clit.  A giant clit. 
[03:32:00]  That's what I called him.  Her clit looks like Bobo's cock.  It's not a cock, though.  It's a big clit.  She's a lady with a gift.  And look, the labia hanging down like a ball bag.  That's just a fucking-  Let me see.  That is just a fucking-  That's a ball bag without the balls.  It's not.  It's a big gooey clit.  Open that up.  Let me see that picture.  In Sparta, that would have been thrown off the cliff.  Her fucking pussy gets so wet.  Look, look.  It's a ball bag without balls in it.  No, it's not.  It's a big fucking lovely pussy.  No, it's not.  She's probably pumped it there, too.  There's other shots where it's not pumped. 
[03:32:30]  I don't like pumped.  With what?  An M80?  That's fucking disgusting.  Did you pay to check out this website?  Years ago.  I don't belong to it.  It's probably been eight years.  But Linda might's a bit up there.  She's a little long in the tooth, as they say.  She's long in the labia.  Why so long in the labia?  Big fucking meaty pussy.  Yeah.  It'd be great to use as a hat.  You can wear her fucking hat in the tundra.  Wear her hat.  Wear her hat.  I'm tired.  I'm a fucking non-improving idiot.  Wear her hat.  Good one. 
[03:33:00]  Well, why don't we go over here and do this?  Hey, you know what?  Lean over here just for a second time.  No, further, further.  Come on.  Stick your hand out, because it's time to get your pinch.  Oh, well.  So much for that.  Go on with the weather.  Go on.  Go on.  I'll go ahead and do the weather right now.  Let's talk about it, and let's take a look at our...  Way to acknowledge something's going on.  What happened?  She leaned over and fell out of her chair.  I saw that clip.  Fell flat on her face.  That's great.  Yeah.  It plays better on video. 
[03:33:30]  Please run the Anthony Poon and Peener PSA bit when the show ends.  That's Tom Owen Dallas.  What happened?  Remember Poon and Peener in the morning?  Oh, of course.  Poon and Poon.  Great show.  How could they not acknowledge that she fucking fell out of her seat?  Oh, well.  So much for that.  Go on with the weather.  Go on.  Go on.  Of course.  Dumb fucking twat anchor.  So much for that.  Go on with the weather.  Wouldn't you spend a little more time with this?  Of course you would. 
[03:34:00]  And then they just go right to the weather.  Let's take a look at our Galveston Tower camera.  Oh, they all suck.  They really are fucking horrible.  Non-improvers.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  The greatest clip ever.  I love that one.  Fantastic.  Eh, good news for all those Star Wars fans out there.  Really?  George Lucas is teaming up with Seth Green to develop a comedic Star Wars animated series.  Isn't there already an animated Star Wars series? 
[03:34:30]  Yes.  So this is going to be a comedic?  Yes, I knew this would get you going.  I think you got Clone Wars on Cartoon Network.  It's not Adult Swim, and Seth Green does a lot of Adult Swim stuff.  Plus, you know, they've done the Robot Chicken Star Wars episodes.  Right.  Seth Green, I'm sure he's had a lot of influence on Family Guy and all the Star Wars that happens  on that show.  What is this going to be like?  How is it going to be funny?  Like, what comedy elements are we going to...  Well...  I'm sure it'll probably just be like, I mean, like I said, both Family Guy and Robot Chicken 
[03:35:00]  both have like hour-long Star Wars specials.  Oh, okay.  So I'm sure it'll be in that fan.  I like that Robot Chicken.  You know what?  Sometimes I can watch it.  I haven't watched it in a while.  Sometimes I can watch it.  Sometimes I can't watch it.  Yeah, of course.  It's hit or miss, but when it's good, it's real good.  I can't watch it since Seth Green just dicked out on us that day.  He just dicked out on us.  Showing he didn't really have a good sense of humor.  He's been in some great, great stuff, and we make fun of one project he was in, and fuck,  man.  He got so defensive on that. 
[03:35:30]  I'll have you know.  Did he give us a I'll have you know?  I'll have you know.  Meanwhile, you get somebody like, you know, Michael Madsen who completely just rips apart  his shit movies and will tell you that they were shit when they're shit, and then he's  been in great movies.  But it's like, all right, we understand.  Everything you do isn't gold.  I might have been pwned.  What?  Chester's Liver from White Bag, right?  That was put out as an April Fool's joke.  Are we picking up on an April Fool's joke? 
[03:36:00]  Oh, someone got you.  And announcing it six days later?  Yeah.  So maybe there isn't a comedic Star Wars animated series that's going to be put out.  If it is an April Fool's joke, it's a sucky April Fool's joke.  It's stupid.  Yeah, because who cares if you fell for it?  Right, right, right.  It's something stupid like that.  I want to know what George Lucas is up to next.  He's good.  Are you saying it's not an April Fool's joke?  I mean, there's like 335 articles on it, and the latest one was just an hour ago.  I mean, I'm sure if it was a goof, I'd get that exult first. 
[03:36:30]  I heard that he wants Seth Green to have his artist draw him a chin.  Yep.  That's what he wants.  Because he has a weak chin.  I'm tired of Lucas and his shitty fucking furry animals.  Ugh.  Stupid Ewoks.  You think you should come up with a new concept at this point?  I'm so fucking tired of it.  At this point, do you think you should try something different?  After Vader, the rest of them can eat my ass.  Do you think George Lucas' mansion has nothing but Star Wars stuff in it? 
[03:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Of course.  That Skywalker Ranch even calls this fucking place.  You think you can't even have a bowl of cereal at his place without fucking some kind of Star Wars feed?  Yeah, we eat C-3PO's.  Yeah.  He bought up all the supply of C-3PO's cereal.  Where's the commercial for that?  Oh, my God.  You think this is every time you walk into a house.  This is playing everywhere.  When you're taking a shit, you hear this.  You lift up the toilet seat, and this is when it plays. 
[03:37:30]  C-3PO's.  Find a commercial for C-3PO's.  Jimmy, you think George Lucas, I don't know, likes Star Wars?  You think he likes it?  I don't think he likes Star Wars.  No?  Huh.  He loves it!  Jimmy just did that for me.  I appreciate it, Jimmy. 
[03:38:00]  And then I can do this.  That's R2-D2, and he's all sad.  All right.  Now, all these unique cereals, like C-3PO's, what shitty cereal are they ripping off and  just change the shape of it?  They're gone now. 
[03:38:30]  No, but, I mean, they all did it.  Like, they would just rip off, like, fucking Frosted Flakes or something and change the  name and make the shape of the thing a little different.  Mr. T cereal?  What was Mr. T cereal?  It was probably Alphabets or something.  Yeah, Alphabets.  I think that's the dad.  See, that's what I'm getting at.  Let me hear the commercial, and maybe we can see and see what it is.  All right.  Figure out what cereal is.  The adventure of a new force at breakfast.  We'll call them C-3PO's.  New C-3PO cereal from Kellogg's.  The Cheerios?  It's the Cheerios.  For two crunches and every double O, a delicious part of this nutritious breakfast. 
[03:39:00]  Now, you can experience the taste of it.  What kind of farts you get if you eat a grapefruit with your cereal?  Oh, terrible.  Your sour stomach.  They said a balanced breakfast, whatever, and they had a big, huge grapefruit there.  A new force at breakfast.  I love when they used to do that, too.  They'd be part of this balanced breakfast, and they'd have the bowl of cereal surrounded  by a balanced breakfast.  Yeah.  Like, you could take the bowl of cereal and throw the fucking thing away.  Right.  Because that's just the bread.  They'd show the milk and toast. 
[03:39:30]  That's just the filler.  Yeah.  That's just the bread.  Part of this nutritious breakfast.  Yeah, it's balanced between healthy and garbage.  There was not something called Urkelos.  There was certainly something called Urkelos.  Urkel for president.  And what's the flavor?  Free campaign button.  Because it looks like another Cheerios.  I think it was just like Fruit Loops.  It is Fruit Loops, because there's different colors.  It's alphabets, but only the letter N.  Family Guy has a great joke. 
[03:40:00]  Peter points to his bowl.  He goes, oh, I think my Cheerios are trying to tell me something.  He goes, Brian, look.  It says, ooh.  He goes, no, those are Cheerios.  I thought it was funny.  It was.  It was.  We're just tired now.  We're laughed out today, Dan.  Urkelos.  Urkelos.  I had no idea.  Christ, stop it.  Turtles.  Just add grape soda.  And then Ninja Turtles.  Yeah.  Yeah, every popular. 
[03:40:30]  Do they still make cereal out of anything that would...  Like, are there fucking avatars?  Those?  Avatarios?  I don't know.  Every time I go to the cereal aisle, I don't look at it the same way as I did when I was a kid.  Yeah, when you were a kid, it was like fucking paradise.  Just grab Raisin Bran and be done with it.  And your mother would fucking get all pissed off and make you grab some stupid Cheerios or...  Some dumb, tasteless piece of shit.  Some fucking special K.  I remember when I was...  And you're like, how about the fucking Captain Crunch with the Crunch Berries? 
[03:41:00]  When I was...  I used to shop...  Peanut Butter Crunch.  What's wrong with you?  No, peanut butter sucks.  Not for breakfast.  And then we would pick out...  We would pick out all the...  Or at least I would.  I'd pick out the Captain Crunch, the Crunch Berries, and then have a whole bowl of just Crunch Berries.  And then they put out a cereal that was just Crunch Berries, because I think they realized  people were doing that.  And there were prizes in there, so you would dig your hand and crush all the cereal to try  to find the little prize.  Well, that's how I used to shop for cereal when I was a kid.  I didn't give a fuck what I wanted to taste. 
[03:41:30]  I just wanted the best prize.  Yeah.  You needed some good shit.  When I was a kid, I had to send away box tops.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  Why would you do that?  So I could get a Tony Tiger swimmer.  It was the Tony Tiger, and his arms were like this, like he was swimming, and there was  a rubber band between his two arms, and you wound it up in the bathtub.  I had one of those.  And then you let him loose, and it went...  And he swam around in the bathtub.  You should plug it in first.  I had one of those.  I know exactly what he's talking about. 
[03:42:00]  And I set the box tops and everything.  It worked for the first two or three times in the fucking rubber band or something.  I became a Natalie Wood swimmer.  And what did Daddy do when he saw that you were playing with the Tony the Tiger swimmer?  Nah, he wasn't there by then.  Oh, okay.  Well, no, he was still there, but he didn't care.  Yeah.  He was 35.  But the day after I sent it, it said allow four to six weeks for delivery.  But as a kid, four to six weeks is a year when you're waiting for something.  Oh, yeah.  So I was out at the mailbox the next day after it was mailed, and my mother's trying to tell 
[03:42:30]  me, it's going to take a little while.  And I'm like, okay, I'll wait.  I'll wait here by the mailbox.  Yeah, what a dope.  I wanted my Tony Tiger swimmer.  What memory was that fucking hiding?  No, it was in the bathtub.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I would wind up and let it hit my rod.  I'd get a boner as Tony Tiger gave me a handy.  And the rubber band would snap against the little tender pink head, already getting hairs  down there because you were more developed than the other boys. 
[03:43:00]  You think one tap from Tiger, Tony the Tiger swimmer made him go blerker blerker?  Yeah, I think that one fucking spin of the little tiger hand made fucking Anthony's  penis throw up in the tub.  That was it.  Blerker blerker.  And I'd have to get out of the tub.  I'd start crying because I didn't know what that feeling was.  You had no idea what it was.  Then you had a clean...  I think I'm sick.  Then you had a clean cum out of your very hairy legs.  Yeah, your little boy...  Your little man having hairy legs.  I was a little tater tot at the time. 
[03:43:30]  We already...  I didn't even know that.  We're convinced that you developed way too early.  No.  Way too early.  No.  I developed right on schedule.  Right on schedule.  Schedule.  I was a little kid.  But I did used to get boners when I was a little kid because I would think about girls.  At what age?  Oh my God, like six.  You remember getting boners at six?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was very young.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  He's a good boy.  Boners at six.  And boners at six would like adhere right to your fucking belly. 
[03:44:00]  There was no fucking elasticity in that muscle.  You know.  Nothing better than when you were a kid and you'd get a boner.  You couldn't even push that thing down like a quarter inch.  Oh, fuck no.  God damn.  Now you can shove it down between your legs and fuck sideways.  Oh yeah.  I gotta tuck my cock in my pocket now.  You fucking had some tension.  Is there anything?  There was some tension on that fucking muscle.  That boner muscle.  Is there anything better than the feeling of a rager? 
[03:44:30]  A rager.  Even at this age.  A fucking rager.  I could hurt those sometimes.  The aching makes it better.  The aching makes it better.  Any girl that thinks it's fucking fun to shift it into first or third gear is a fucking idiot.  The boner has to stay in the second or fourth gear position.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nothing wrong with neutral either.  Neutral is good too.  Especially when they check to see if it's in neutral.  You know how you've got to shake that thing around a little bit. 
[03:45:00]  Could you check and see if my boner's in neutral?  Thank you, dear.  Thank you.  All right, why don't we go home?  Shift it into reverse.  Push down.  Yeah, I think we've got to...  Do we have to...  Oh, I froze up.  We've got a couple little dumb things we've got to do before we go home today.  Sorry for the pal talk people, but I froze and I'm not logging back on.  We've got to do things.  I got things to do. 
[03:45:30]  I got my workout.  Oh, today?  I should go to the gym today.  It's going very well.  As I'm sitting here, I can feel almost like my tits and my side fat mushing together.  Really?  Did you like the Easter candy I brought in today?  I did, but I only had a few pieces.  Where's the rest of it?  I don't know.  E-Rock probably ate it.  Fucking E-Rock.  Probably smears it on his chest.  Just lets it soak into his skin.  Do you know the self-control I need to not eat that fucking dark chocolate shit in there? 
[03:46:00]  I hate dark chocolate.  It's fucking terrible.  Dark chocolate rules.  No, it's good.  Dark chocolate fucking rules.  Any kind of chocolate.  You've got to know which one to buy because it gets a little...  Yes, milk chocolate.  No, it gets bitter.  But if you get a nice combination, that dark chocolate is way better.  I don't have many weaknesses when it comes to sweets.  I'm not like a...  Yeah, right, when it comes to sweet beer.  A bunch of grapes crushed.  Fermented for a while.  You've got it.  But it's...  Chocolate is one thing that's... 
[03:46:30]  Like good chocolate.  Not like cheesy fucking cheap chocolate.  Good fucking chocolate is just amazing.  Do you...  Truffles.  Do you like nuts with your chocolate?  No.  No nuts, no crispies, no crunchies.  Smooth, milky chocolate.  You don't like almonds in your chocolate?  No.  It's delicious.  I'm a big almonds fucking fan.  Look at you.  Relax, man.  These are dark chocolate kisses.  No, I'm just having one.  I'm just having one.  That's the last thing Ant wants is a dark chocolate kiss.  I know.  Anthony. 
[03:47:00]  Godiva?  Yeah.  Dark chocolate covered almonds.  No!  Yes, I'm telling you.  No!  Why would you fuck up the flavor of chocolate by adding anything else to it?  Fucking almonds.  Anything else.  Chocolate is a standalone thing.  You're right.  It's standalone.  No.  Uh-uh.  Yay!  What about a Nestle Crunch bar with little rice things in there?  Those are not mine.  Those are pretty good.  Hey, they ever make that in a dark chocolate form?  I'm pretty sure.  They did it in everything. 
[03:47:30]  I'm going to search that out today.  I'm pretty sure.  Because I used to love that candy bar.  They make dark chocolate Reese's, too.  Sorry.  I just saw line three.  And, of course, it's a horribly racist joke.  Yeah, it's a nigger joke.  No.  I don't like the context.  Well.  But it is.  It was, yeah.  I was just stating the obvious.  Fucking. 
[03:48:00]  We should go home.  Yeah, let's take a hike.  We're getting punchy.  That's when we end up getting in trouble.  Hopefully not for good.  Why?  I was just stating the obvious.  No, you were.  Just kidding.  Jimmy, am I all right?  I hope he's in the mine.  Fuck you.  That is pretty sad.  The younger version.  I got his face.  The old days.  A couple of fresh-faced kids since radio.  That's right.  I remember.  Dark kisses are not bad.  You like it?  You like dark kisses? 
[03:48:30]  Get it?  Get it?  I don't.  I've been eating peeps.  Holy fuck.  Anything better than a goddamn peep?  Yes, anything.  I fucking hate peeps.  I don't like the peeps.  I don't like the peeps.  Peeps are fucking horrendous.  It's a marshmallow peep.  Fucking peeps.  Do you like malamars?  No.  Do you like cramars?  Delicious mystery appetizer?  No, you don't like malamars?  Malamars are pretty good.  The chocolate-covered marshmallow thing with some kind of cookie in it?  Did you ever like chocolate-covered jelly rings? 
[03:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, those are pretty good.  Now we're talking.  Those are pretty goddamn good.  Every goddamn deli had those.  A little ring of goodness.  Dude, the whole box I could easily eat.  Why, though?  It sounds like it would be shitty.  And they make those sticks of them, too.  You'd bite into it in that red jelly.  It was like Farrah's asshole at the end.  Jesus.  Why do you have to do that to my treat? 
[03:49:30]  Wonderful stuff, though.  Yeah.  Bring it back memories.  Let's get out of here.  Yeah, let's go, man.  It's going to be 90 today in New York.  Is it really?  Yeah, let's get out in the sun.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Slather on some suntan lotion on each other.  Let's go look at boobies.  What do you say?  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of boobage out on the street today.  Oh, yeah.  Taking the bike out?  Dan, what are you doing?  I don't know what I'm doing.  I've got to get my fucking spandex with no underpants.  You want to fucking come on over? 
[03:50:00]  All right.  Hang out in the back?  Maybe a Bud Light or two.  Well, I thought you were...  Yeah, I thought the weekdays were...  I do, but you know what?  It's a weekday.  It's too fucking nice out.  I'm not going to restrict myself.  If I hang out and sit in my backyard, I'm going to enjoy a nice cold Bud Light.  You went from not drinking for a while to...  Well, now I'm only going to drink on weekends and keep it safe during the week.  I haven't...  I'm not going to...  I didn't drink Monday or Tuesday.  You're just...  What a selfish prick he is.  He goes, here, ride your motorcycle and get drunk at my house.  Yeah.  Drink with me. 
[03:50:30]  On your motorcycle.  I didn't think about that.  On your two-wheel auto.  Wait, Jimmy has something to say.  Yes, sir.  No, but you said that you were going to take a little break and then it was...  Well, only on weekends and now it's...  Well, it depends on how close you are to the sun on any given day.  Here's what it is.  Now we're right back to where we were.  Within a week.  No, no, no.  Not.  Not back where I was.  Here's what it is.  What's the new rules?  There's no rules.  You're laying down for yourself.  The rules are...  First, there's no rules.  It's me...  Yeah.  Giving myself moderation in a way that I can... 
[03:51:00]  In a way that I can work with.  So now, obviously, weekends, if I want to have some beer on the weekends, and not to the  point of fucking, you know, raging intoxication.  I'll have beers on the weekend.  Now today, I have the trainer coming over pretty early in the afternoon.  And I will work out, and I will work out, and then I am going to sit out in the yard with a nice cold bud light in the sun, in the heat, and just sip away at that bud light in the backyard. 
[03:51:30]  Because why should I restrict myself?  I'm not talking about pounding and pounding drinks all night long, all day and all night. 
[03:52:00]  I just want to enjoy the nice weather in the way I like to enjoy it.  A cold beer.  Face down in the grass.  I want to enjoy it like other people do in their yard.  Or, you know, Mrs. Shatner.  Are you going to come in tomorrow with one of those awkward sunburns because you fell asleep in your backyard again?  The back of his head and his back is all burned.  His face is nice.  He's got fucking dirt and a worm.  Fucking green tinge.  Fucking mulch. 
[03:52:30]  We all have to make believe that you didn't fall asleep in the backyard again.  Anthony's the only guy that tries to deny drinking when he has mulch in his eyebrows.  Isn't it true you came in here once with the left side of your face sunburn in your left hand or something?  Yes, yes.  I had fallen asleep in the chair out back on a very sunny, hot day.  And I was like, my head was on the side.  That's what we all saw.  And I had a 50-50 burn.  So what's the difference?  You're just... 
[03:53:00]  Like close encounters.  What's different?  Because Jimmy wants to know.  The difference is that the moderation level is there.  It's not like...  Like, let's say we're looking at a few weeks ago.  Anthony would go home and sit down on the couch, start watching some TV, and then just go,  I guess I'll grab a beer and go downstairs and grab a beer.  And that would not stop until Anthony went to sleep. 
[03:53:30]  So that was, you know, a lot of hours of drinking beer.  And it was winter.  You were bored.  Yeah.  And now, like, I really...  And you can laugh, but I wasn't even thinking about having a beer Monday or last night.  Even watching the game, I had my bottled water, and was just enjoying the game. 
[03:54:00]  I like the fact that Anthony drank on Sunday, and he hasn't blacked out in two days, and he considers it a victory.  I had two Bud Lights on Sunday.  I had two Bud Lights on Sunday at Mom and Sal's.  And then I drove home, and that was it.  And I went to sleep.  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  It's all about moderation.  What'd you dream of?  You were a horse pulling a cart in the winter.  Beer.  Clydesdale.  I dreamt that was a tree, and there was clouds of beer over me, making me grow.  All right.  We'll see how...  So it's about moderation, because...  Can you teach me something about that?  Moderation?  And was wondering what happened to the pillowcases. 
[03:55:00]  Whoops.  Were you shit on them?  No.  No.  Other hole.  Danny had an accident.  Puked you pissed.  You peed on the fucking pillowcases?  No.  I had a little bit of throw up.  Oh, my God.  I got a text from Ang.  Where are the silk pillowcases from Keith's room?  I was like, oh, those are in the washing machine.  Danny threw up on them.  Not on them.  It was just splatter.  Splatter patterns.  Threw up on the floor.  Oh, did you?  You got the floor? 
[03:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  Is there a rug in there?  Yeah, but I think it's cool.  I got the wood.  That's refreshing.  You know, it's great.  There's a fucking $3 million house being used as a vomitorium.  Like ancient Rome.  I had an interesting evening.  Yeah, that was a lot of...  What was that?  Maker's Mark?  Yeah, I don't know why I was doing that.  Shots of Makers.  It's just stupid.  Can I speculate as to why you were doing it?  It's called alcoholism.  That's my rough guess.  I don't get like that ever, honestly. 
[03:56:00]  Now, Danny's usually...  I'm usually quite...  I've never seen Danny vomit in his...  I feel like Jerry.  I haven't vomited since 1987.  Yeah, Jerry would love that.  You see, but when somebody...  When somebody drinks a case of beer and doesn't vomit,  you're not making a case that they don't have a drinking problem.  It's not a good case for their healthy.  You know, I didn't even think about that.  Their body can comfortably absorb enough alcohol to paralyze the rest of the staff.  It's called building a tolerance. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, there you go.  Yes, yes.  I'm kind of glad I threw up because if I didn't, I would have been in a much worse world of hurt.  Sometimes it's better to just purge that out of you.  And I had a little bit of like a stand-by-me thing going on because like I kept...  Like, you know, I had to clean it up, obviously, and it was like, you know,  three in the morning or whatever the hell time it was, and I'm trying to like, you know,  sop it all up.  Holy shit.  It's just disgusting.  And I keep smelling it.  I'm like...  And I got to run to the sink and puke again.  That was awful.  That was a terrible thing. 
[03:57:00]  I don't like throwing up.  It's one of my least favorite activities.  Yeah.  No one likes throwing up.  The mates came over, though.  We gave it once over to the whole place, so...  Yeah, Keith said I was banned from the North Wing.  You're banned from the North Wing now?  He's putting a lock on the door.  Shit.  There's only like two more rooms you're allowed in.  Danny's getting banned from like every room in the house.  Well, where else am I banned from?  You were banned from where the Christmas tree is stored.  Oh, yeah.  When you decided to sleep in your boxers on top of my Christmas tree.  Hey, listen.  We don't need to tell these stories. 
[03:57:30]  What's creepy is you're not banning them, though.  No, no.  You have people that are banning people...  I have no say in my house.  ...in your own house.  I have no say in my house.  Are you kidding?  You've got to be the master of your...  What is it?  Is it like the master of your castle?  No, the...  The king of your castle.  The king of my castle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know what?  That's too much work.  How come we don't tell the stories about when I just come over and nothing happens?  I know.  Yeah, we sit, watch fucking a movie or something.  Watch TV or something.  Fall asleep, we're tired.  Yeah.  Because it rarely happens.  It's only the throw up and sleeping on top of Christmas tree boxes. 
[03:58:00]  Ridiculously.  The fucking drunken karaoke.  It's fun over there.  All right.  It's funny.  A few weeks ago, I was having to drink some board.  In the house, it's too cold.  Now, it's, well, it's sunny out.  Well, yeah.  It's a very narrow window of weather where I won't drink.  Yeah, exactly.  When don't you drink when it's...  It's got to be partly cloudy and 68 degrees.  I refuse to drink when it's tepid.  I wish we had the original announcement he made a week ago.  I didn't say I was not drinking. 
[03:58:30]  I didn't say that.  You're pretty proud of yourself.  I was not drinking.  You got it?  Oh, we might have it.  I said I was...  As long as it's quick, because we're running into Ron and Fez time.  I said I was going to stop for a little while, just to, you know...  And that was six days, but three of them were a bellyache.  Yeah.  All right.  And then the weekend came...  Lydia was proud of you.  Let's not forget.  I had a couple of Guinness.  And then I had a couple of Bud Lights on a Sunday.  That's moderate drinking.  Not even.  That's lightweight drinking.  Yeah, I quit for a week. 
[03:59:00]  It wasn't like anything in particular.  I was just like, you know what?  I've been, like, drinking beers, like, every night.  Not a lot.  You know, three, four beers, whatever.  If you stop, then you're able to just...  I was like, I hope I'm able to stop, because if I have a problem, like, stopping, or if  I start to get anxious about it, then I probably do have an issue.  And I said, fuck it.  I'm just not going to drink for the week.  And it was fine.  I didn't have any problems at all.  Yeah.  It's no big deal.  There's plenty of water in the house.  Put a little vodka in there, and...  Yeah, no one's a wiser.  Jesus.  Let's get out of here.  We'll play that clip tomorrow. 
[03:59:30]  Maybe get into it more.  Let's care.  But it's going to be a great day in New York.  Enjoy your day, man.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Let's care.  All the Anthony mornings, 6 to 11 a.m. Eastern on the virus.  Serious.  XM.  This weekend, experience five years of unpredictable, uncensored, and often uncomfortable O&A moments.  The O.P. and Anthony Show presents the worst of the satellite years.  Here's a taste.  I had to make, so I went in there, and it looks like meat ice cream. 
[04:00:00]  It looks like somebody said, do I have a meat cone, like a fucking roast beef ice cream with  little bits of pimento on it.  Can we put a party hat on it or something?  Oh, dude.  I'd love to.  Hey, can we do like Mr. Potato Head with...  Mr. Shithead?  Yeah, let's do Mr. Shithead.  Could the interns maybe make little, like, things, like eyes and stuff?  Get in there.  Get in there.  Breathe it in.  Enjoy it.  Be a part of it.  Can we get $100?  $100?  Ha ha.  Bye-bye. 
[04:00:30]  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye-bye. </pre>
