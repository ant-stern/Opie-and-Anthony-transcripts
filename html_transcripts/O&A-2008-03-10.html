<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts jokingly acknowledging their "shock jock" reputation before diving into the aftermath of a disastrous on-air stunt: the "baby diaper mustache" challenge. Opie, having jokingly offered to make a mustache from a used diaper if a listener provided one, found himself forced to follow through when his co-workers, Steve, E-Rock, and Rich Voss (who was unexpectedly brought in by his colleagues), conspired to deliver a diaper to the studio. This resulted in widespread vomiting among the staff, including Opie, Bob Kelly, and Rich Voss.  Photos and video of the event were heavily promoted throughout the show.  Guest Jimmy Norton, present in the studio, recounted a successful stand-up performance in Atlanta and shared in the laughter over the diaper incident.  Listener calls followed, some commenting on the video and others sharing personal anecdotes.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a satirical discussion about the proliferation of new psychological diagnoses, contrasting them with simpler, often vulgar, terms from the past.  The hosts speculated on the pharmaceutical industry's influence and the potential homogenization of society, even predicting a future where individuality would be suppressed. This segment included calls from listeners offering their own takes on this topic, with one describing clinical depression as previously being referred to as "your life sucks."  Further discussions, often rambling and vulgar, ensued involving Jimmy Norton’s childhood therapy, speculations about the hosts’ fathers, and the absurdity of daylight saving time.  Another caller described fibromyalgia as "whiny pants disease," prompting a discussion about various medical conditions and the ease of obtaining sick leave.  A caller mentioning body dysmorphic disorder elicited a nonchalant response regarding self-mutilation from the hosts.

The "baby diaper mustache" incident was revisited in detail, with Opie recounting the staff's conspiracy to procure the diaper from Rich Voss, who had a newborn.  Audio clips of Voss's arrival, Opie's horrified reaction, Bob Kelly vomiting, and the application of the diaper contents to Opie's face were played. The hosts repeatedly emphasized the horrendous smell and appearance, continuing to promote the online photos and videos. The conversation then shifted to a news story about "Camp Lickalotta," a lesbian-run summer camp with a controversial name. Opie detailed a recent visit to a lesbian bar in Brooklyn, describing the patrons' appearance and behavior.  This was followed by further discussion of the camp's name and Opie's bar experience.  The segment ended with another promotion of the diaper mustache content, encouraging a Google bomb of the phrase.  Brian Regan, a comedian present in the green room, was also mentioned.

Comedian Brian Regan joined the broadcast as a guest. The show started with a recap of the diaper incident, highlighting its YouTube fame.  The hosts and Regan engaged in banter about his new glasses, clothing choices, and news reporters’ accents, particularly the inconsistent use of Spanish accents.  A caller reminisced about Regan's earlier appearances, noting listener complaints about format changes. The conversation then touched on the metric system and listener calls continued to set up bits for Regan, referencing his previous appearances and catchphrases like his Pop-Tarts and Fig Newtons jokes. Regan discussed comedian rivalries and maintaining an on-stage persona, mentioning his act's evolution to include more "angry" material, such as anecdotes from a butterfly pavilion.  A caller brought up a past awkward segment with Regan, Joey Ramone, and the Dominics. The hosts promoted Regan's tour and upcoming appearance on David Letterman.  Further conversation touched on Regan’s marriage, children, tour bus, and the awkwardness of post-show fan interactions, leading into increasingly vulgar and inappropriate jokes and anecdotes about unwanted fan attention at parties.

A call from a soldier, George, a former Navy SEAL, who had just returned from Iraq, followed.  The hosts spoke to George about his naval experiences, including his rank (Command Master Chief), his time in the first Gulf War, HALO jumps from 35,000 feet, Navy SEAL training techniques, and breath-holding capabilities.  Further discussions about various special operations units (Navy SEALs, Green Berets, Army Rangers, Delta Force, Air Force PJs), George's experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, underwater combat (including a fight with a Frenchman), SEAL training ("Hell Week"), and bodily functions during combat (defecating in one's pants) were had. George described being shot in the arm.  Discussions also covered the accuracy of media portrayals of the Iraq War, the physical and mental challenges of SEAL training, and the perceived manliness of Navy uniforms.  This segment also featured clips from the TV show *Quincy, M.E.*, and a continued discussion of Anthony's visit to a lesbian bar.

The show continued with the hosts reacting negatively to a song, criticizing its lyrics and acting, then playing a portion revealing it to be a tribute to Brad Delp, the late Boston singer who committed suicide using a barbecue.  The hosts discussed the method of suicide in detail. The conversation then shifted to a lawyer, Amelia Tavares, suing six casinos for $20 million due to their alleged failure to address her compulsive gambling. The hosts debated the merits of the lawsuit, expressing strong opinions on personal responsibility versus casino liability. A caller who worked in a casino shared experiences with addiction, followed by discussion on compulsion, obsession, and addiction, with a caller offering definitions differentiating between the three. Another caller shared a personal story about his father's compulsive gambling. The segment concluded with the "Line of the Day" segment, featuring humorous lines and a segment about Spud Buckley, a vendor selling "Fudgy Wudgie bars."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk Show Radio Host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  It was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us and then let him starve.  And then let him starve.  Great.  Kind of like what we're doing to the listeners.  Starving them of entertainment.  They are sick.  Freak!  Bobby, please, love.  There's one part we want you to see.  That's easy. 
[00:01:00]  Are you okay?  Where entertainment is going?  These guys are watching porn.  Oh, Jesus.  What are we talking about?  We're going to go out.  What is this?  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, good God. 
[00:01:30]  What the hell?  What time is it?  Where are we?  Just in time to be dark again.  Daylight savings time, huh?  Anyone use it as an excuse?  No?  Everyone came in?  We thought you were going to be the one.  No, no.  I have my iPhone.  You know, it automatically adjusts the time.  You don't even have to reset it.  That's wonderful.  Wonderful phone. 
[00:02:00]  And that's the alarm I use.  It is too early to do anything.  It really is.  Well, good morning to everybody.  I want to start the Opie and Anthony show by apologizing to everybody we offended on Friday's show.  Is that how we got to start every show?  Pretty much, yeah.  By just apologizing to anyone we offended on the previous program.  Oh, my God.  My phone just rings after every show.  Oh, my God.  Just let us do our radio show because we know more than you. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  Just leave us alone.  Yeah.  We can handle this thing.  We do this.  We do this now.  On a daily basis.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We got a little Jimmy Norton back from Atlanta, Georgia, where I heard you just had an amazing show, huh, Jimmy?  Yeah, they're hardcore down there, man.  It was really a great theater gig.  One of the best I've had in a long, long time.  Wow.  Yeah.  I loved Atlanta. 
[00:03:00]  Very, very cool.  Also, we'll get a Google bomb.  Baby diaper mustache all day long today.  Start Googling baby diaper mustache.  You want that on?  Baby diaper mustache.  Number one on there.  Well, I guess we got to explain.  We'll play some audio a little later this morning, but.  Oh, it's horrific.  Just Google baby diaper mustache.  I don't know how you did that.  I don't know how I went out in public all weekend long. 
[00:03:30]  I was at FH just hearing joke after joke.  How's your lip?  Hey, where's the mustache?  Got blank?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, shut up.  That video, I watched it was horrendous.  Yeah.  It was awful.  Well, I guess we should explain.  They're cutting up the audio, so we'll just explain a little later this morning.  But basically, I've been doing this bit as a goof for a while. 
[00:04:00]  Where out of nowhere, I will go on the air and say, I will do baby diaper mustache.  Meaning, if you have a baby, you bring the baby by the studio, and I will do something with the diaper and make a mustache.  The diaper is pretty much ready for immediate deposit in the trash.  Right.  It's not a diaper that has just been bought. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  It has been one that probably the little lad has been wearing.  And it really needs to just immediately be thrown away.  Correct.  But instead, Ovi takes it and makes a mustache like you would with finger paints.  Right.  But the beauty of the bit, the beauty of the bit, listen to me, listen to me.  There's no beauty to this bit.  Well, the beauty was that I would just go on the air with like an hour left in the show, 45 minutes left in the show, and I'm like, baby diaper mustache. 
[00:05:00]  You bring by a baby and the diaper, I will make a mustache.  Simple as that.  And people are like, oh, my God.  They freak out like, ah.  But the beauty is I just know I'm not giving anyone enough time to actually come by with a baby.  Grab the baby up, make sure the baby's diaper is ready.  Right.  For something like that.  And then the end of the show hits, and then, oh, well, no baby diaper mustache today.  Well, on Friday's show, I was feeling a bit silly, so I said baby diaper mustache. 
[00:05:30]  But here is where it gets very, very interesting.  I said that later on in the show with maybe an hour left in the show, a little more than an hour, actually.  Yeah, you left too much time.  I was risking it a little bit.  No, but that's not why I got caught.  But the reason I got caught, and it was a behind-the-scenes thing, we were still over here, and I told Steve, look, Steve, I really want to hit this baby diaper mustache out of the park.  I need a promo to really hype this thing that I'll never do.  Hype this thing I will never do. 
[00:06:00]  Get the promos, get the promo voice and the lasers and echoes, baby diaper mustache, diaper mustache, mustache.  Pew, pew, pew, pew.  So I'm explaining to Steve while we're still over here what I want.  E-Rock, I believe, is over here in the conversation, and of course Steve.  Now, they're the only two that kind of know what's going on.  I'm going to do this later on in the show.  They decide to call Rich Voss immediately, giving Rich Voss plenty of time to come by the show. 
[00:06:30]  And I got caught with my pants down.  I got outwitted by E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  I got outwitted by Steve.  I'd feel better if I got outwitted by the baby diaper.  What's more embarrassing, baby diaper mustache or getting outwitted by those two?  And outwitted by Rich Voss.  The trifecta.  Oh, God.  The trifecta of stupidity outwitted me.  And boy, do they outwit me good.  I can't even make fun of E-Rock. 
[00:07:00]  He got me really, really good on fire.  Steve got me really, really good.  Voss got me really, really good.  And so Voss shows up with the diaper.  But at first, I thought he was just stopping by.  And his acting was pretty good, Jimmy.  He's like, what are you talking about?  He's like, oh, so if.  What are you talking about?  He's like, oh, so if someone had a diaper between now and the end of the show, you would have to do this mustache thing.  I'm like, yeah.  But obviously, you did not bring Bonnie or the baby, so I'm off the hook.  At that point, he reaches into his coat and slams down a diaper that's about a day or two old. 
[00:07:30]  And bam, slams it onto the counter.  And the rest is radio history.  When?  There's Voss presenting the diaper.  Where are these pictures going to be?  Because none of these pictures are up yet.  I know there's a video up on YouTube.  They're up on the site we can't mention.  And we'll have them up on onaradio.com today.  All right, so the website that's named after the show that we can't mention, they're up there right now?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:08:00]  And there's Voss presenting the diaper in a plastic bag.  What really got me is when I started thinking, oh, wow, you know, that must have been just in that bin that you put all the nasty diapers in.  Right, right.  And then he had to take it out.  Yeah.  So it was sitting there just fermenting with the rest of the.  Yeah.  I'm just looking at the pictures.  Voss.  That's a great picture.  So Voss presents the diaper, throws it on the counter.  And in this shot that I'm looking at, Bob Kelly's already puking. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, he's puking.  Or getting ready to puke.  A little weak stomach Bob Kelly.  Which is one of my favorite things ever.  Look at how red his head gets when he throws up.  And Laszlo.  Makes those sounds.  Laszlo was on the show Friday.  And Laszlo goes, with all the puking Bob Kelly does, you would think he'd be thinner.  He'd be thinner.  So then Bob Kelly pukes.  Then Rich Voss pukes.  And then I had to do this damn thing.  Yeah.  Because at this point, I'm like, I have no choice. 
[00:09:00]  I have to do this.  And this is what I had to explain to my chick all weekend long.  Look, man.  Good luck.  Look, I'm being cocky.  And I'm saying I'm going to do this if someone stops by.  And then someone stops by with it.  I look like the biggest wimp if I don't go through with this.  You have to do it.  I have to do this.  You have to understand.  And then I puked.  And it takes a lot for me to puke.  I swear, I rarely, rarely puked.  That would do it.  I started puking immediately.  Immediately.  And then everyone else in the studio started dry heaving.  It was just like a chain reaction. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  It was a big puke fest.  Bobby, though, puking.  I can't get enough of that.  No.  That sound he makes.  Beep.  Beep.  He runs to a garbage pail.  His head turns beet red.  It's just visceral.  He can't help that reaction.  Yeah.  It's so violent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's convulsing.  It's just hilarious.  I'm thinking to myself, why is he puking?  He doesn't have to do this crap.  No.  And then people at FH Riley's this weekend, they're like, so they've seen the video. 
[00:10:00]  It is up on YouTube.  I mean, we'll play the audio and all that, but you can go right to YouTube and check out  the video.  They're like, why did you put gloves on to make a baby diaper mustache?  I'm like, it's simple.  I didn't want, the less parts of my body that was in contact with this, the better off for  me.  That's why.  Because I heard that too.  It's like, you know, the gloves, but he's smearing it under his nose and.  Well, why am I going to get it on my fingers too? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  If I don't have to.  That makes sense.  So my.  Eat with your hands.  So it was a weird weekend.  My chick refused to kiss me all weekend long.  Wow.  She started sort of kissing me late last night when I went to bed.  Did she give your, your lip a smell first?  Did she?  No, I.  Give a sniff.  I had to go home.  The other thing was that, you know, I was growing like a four or five day goatee, just  kind of not shave.  Yeah.  I wasn't shaved or whatever.  And it was, I had to go home immediately and shave. 
[00:11:00]  And then I, I, it's a weird thing when you got, you get some kind of like just weird  thing on you.  I kept scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing.  Even last night, I'm taking a shower before I went to bed, just scrubbing under my nose.  I, I just feel like I couldn't get the.  You could still kind of.  I, no, I, I couldn't.  No aroma.  It was long gone, but it was more of a mental thing.  Like I got to get clean.  I got to get clean.  I'm just scrubbing away.  So we'll have the audio in a little bit. 
[00:11:30]  And, uh, and the promo that I've been airing, being a cocky shock jock, like I will do this  if you come by.  You're shocking.  So it was a, it was a hell of a weekend with all the jokes.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  Oh, that's funny.  I haven't heard that one yet.  Ah, let's say hi to Brent in South Dakota.  Brent, what's up?  What's up, gentlemen? 
[00:12:00]  Hey, how are you, sir?  I am fantastic.  You know, I've seen lots of videos, like two girls and one, two girls, one child, other  hot stuff.  Ah, classic.  Yeah.  And, you know, it doesn't faze me.  Yeah.  Watching you do the mustache, I gagged for a solid 15 minutes afterwards.  Yeah, really, man?  The most wild thing I have ever seen in my life.  Well, I, uh, I did it and then I presented myself to the camera and then I, it was like,  I guess, I guess it was like being part of a rodeo. 
[00:12:30]  You see how long you could hold your composure or whatever.  And then it was seconds.  And then I'm just like already dry heaving.  I didn't puke until I went into the bathroom and I just lost my breakfast.  Everyone else starts puking.  My favorite part of the video though is Steve, when Steve realizes what's going to happen,  when, when, uh, Voss throws the diaper down onto the, uh, the console or whatever.  Steve, you could see him in the background jumping up and down like a little boy.  Oh, he was so happy.  Like a little boy.  So happy. 
[00:13:00]  So.  But yeah, Oh, I, I salute you.  And I have a quick question for a little Jimmy.  Yes.  Yes.  Um, this Friday I am going to see you at the Gothic Theater in Englewood, Colorado.  If there are any tickets available, I encourage all people to come up.  Okay.  And, uh, my friend and I are driving six and a half hours to see you and we were wondering  if we could possibly meet you.  So that might be a range, but, uh, I, I don't know.  I, I tend to shy away from, uh, any public dealings with the fans. 
[00:13:30]  I don't believe in autograph seekers.  No.  I, I, I hope you have another jeer situation.  You asked.  No, I'm the easiest, I'm the easiest dope in the world to meet.  I stay after every show.  I sign stuff.  So yeah, people email me.  I don't answer you when you email me that.  Could you, could I meet you after the show?  Cause you'll see when you get there.  I'm always out at the end signing, um, and selling nonsense.  You can always meet me after the show.  We're much different than all the other celebrities out there.  We're like just, we're not celebrities.  We're eager beavers.  We just, we just kind of hang around way too long.  Hoping that someone will come up and say hi. 
[00:14:00]  How are you?  We're the only celebrities.  And I use the celebrity word very loosely.  I look, I even got quotes.  Uh, we're the only celebrities that are the last ones to leave a venue.  Yeah.  You know, just imagine seeing like you too.  And then Bono is like the last person to leave Madison square guard.  And milling about.  That's awesome.  There might be a janitor around here that might want to say hi to us.  There might be a fan.  Right.  We just, you guys have to remember, I'm from South Dakota, so we don't see celebrities. 
[00:14:30]  Right on, bro.  South Dakota.  All right, sir.  Yeah, I know.  It's, it's awful land.  So, all right.  All right, you guys.  All right.  Let's go to Amy in Atlanta.  Amy, what's up?  Hey, morning, guys.  Good morning.  I was calling to say how much Jimmy rocked on Saturday here down there.  Oh, thank you, sweetheart.  Yeah, I'm hearing that Jimmy was great in Atlanta, so.  And then you got a chance to see him in Colorado and Minneapolis, right?  Minneapolis might be sold out for Saturday, but Colorado might be too for Friday. 
[00:15:00]  Check.  Wow.  You're doing a double this weekend.  Well, yeah.  Denver and Minneapolis Friday, Saturday.  Yeah.  Good time of year to go because you'll never have flight problems.  No.  Oh, I heard you guys, I heard you guys had a windy flight back into Newark.  Horrendous.  And all you're thinking about is that, that, that plane video from last week.  Oh, right.  Ooh.  Wasn't that bad, but it was rocking.  Well, according to Kenny, it was.  He's like, I, all I was thinking about was that, that plane video you guys were talking  about last week.  Mr. Doom and Gloom, of course.  Mr. Ketchup, man.  Did he lean over at some point and go, this is probably it, Jimmy. 
[00:15:30]  We're going to die.  No, he doesn't say anything in those moments.  It was actually a very nerve wracking flight coming back in.  It really was.  Going into Atlanta was a lot of turbulence, but it was clouds.  Yeah.  So I don't mind that.  Yeah.  So I know why it was turbulent.  Yeah.  You're flying and I hate when I see no clouds.  It's like, where are the clouds?  There should be a one.  There's no clouds.  This is not healthy.  You know it's wind.  It was really bad.  And he doesn't say anything in those things.  I can't tell if he wants to be calm, cool, and collected, or if the animal part of his 
[00:16:00]  little walnut brain is just what's taking over.  He's like a frightened horse.  He just gets big white eyes.  Like he's been spooked.  He starts moving his foot like a hoof against the floor.  He wants to run.  He doesn't know what to do.  Hey, speaking of Kenny, there's all the stuff.  Now, Jimmy, on Friday, because we didn't have Kenny, we kind of had to do our own thing,  and I went into the Kenny drawer, and this is what we found.  Can you move that? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, there you go.  That's what we found in Kenny's drawer.  It's just about 40 bottles.  40 bottles of little ketchup.  Of ketchup.  Now, it's not the ketchup packets.  No.  Because people got confused because they brought this up over the weekend, too.  No, these are little tiny bottles of Heinz ketchup.  You could easily put ketchup on maybe two hamburgers with this thing.  When you get something, maybe room service at one of your finer hotels, they bring up those things.  Right.  The little bottle of ketchup. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Well, we found 40 of them, or just about, in Kenny's drawer.  He's saving the ones we don't use, Jimmy.  Look at that.  We made a pyramid of ketchup where you usually sit on Friday.  How many should you?  I think if he had, say, five in there, that would be healthy.  Five is good.  He said, like, if somebody needs some ketchup, five.  Yeah.  And then just throw the rest away.  And then he's got the little jars of jelly on the other side there.  They come.  We went up in the park for our breakfast, and they'll send sometimes a little thing of ketchups or jams for our toast.  Yep. 
[00:17:30]  Kenny, we weren't snooping.  You weren't here, and we had to, like, look for stuff, and that's what we found in your drawer.  Waste not, want not.  Why are you saving ketchup bottles?  You're creeping everybody out.  You're like a cereal.  Are you the ketchup killer?  I just throw them in a drawer.  We have, you know, an abundance.  No, they were all wrapped up nice in a bag and stuff.  It was very serial killer-ish.  Jimmy's right, though.  After five, like, then it's crazy. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Like, you could maybe ask them, say, look, we don't need any more ketchup, so just send it over.  And if someone needs ketchup, then they could go into the drawer.  You could go into the drawer and go, look, I got five.  I know, but you never know.  You might need some more.  You never know what.  When would you need 40?  Let me, like, what circumstance, like, is, like, NATO going to have troops walk in and go, do you have any ketchup, guys?  It's an emergency.  We need as much ketchup as you can give us.  I have 40 bottles.  I'm prepared. 
[00:18:30]  It's, uh.  For what?  Exactly.  It's a little creepy, Kenny.  And then we got little bottles of Tabasco.  And some jams and marmalade.  Marmalade.  And Bob is sitting in front of them.  It just looks like a normal shot of Bob sitting to breakfast.  Just piling up the condiments, getting ready for breakfast.  That's stupid, Bob.  Right.  All right, that's all we got on the ketchup.  We were hoping to do about five or ten minutes on the, uh.  And then the whole pile fell down.  What can you say about it?  It's creepy.  It's like there's little bottle, the little hotel bottles. 
[00:19:00]  They're so cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Forty of them.  Forty of them.  Forty.  In one drawer.  I'm very proud of that.  Why?  I don't know.  It's ketchup.  He's just a crazy person.  You don't stay at newspapers, do you?  No, no.  I don't hoard things.  I think you might be a hoarder.  Yeah, he is a hoarder.  You're right.  I'm starting to think you gotta be a hoarder.  His wife and kids probably don't tolerate it or he'd have newspapers stacked to the ceiling.  Right.  No, I hate clutter.  Well, you love ketchup though. 
[00:19:30]  I just throw it in the drawer.  I have a visual that you're a hoarder.  Like you just have newspapers piled up all over your house and there's like tunnels in  the middle of them.  No.  So you can get to your bedroom.  You can get to and fro.  No clutter in my house.  Huh?  No clutter in my house.  Probably not even a...  You see how I keep my hotel room?  Yeah, it's really creepy.  Kenny's one of the only people alive that actually unpacks in a hotel room neatly.  Oh yeah?  Yeah, all the drawers and he...  You know, some people might unpack their suitcase if you're gone for a week, a little  over a week. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And maybe throw it all in one drawer or two drawers.  He's got a sock drawer, an underwear drawer.  Like home.  Yeah.  He wants things hung up.  Everything's hung up nice in the closet.  You go to his room in the morning, his bed's already made and he's...  You make your own bed in the morning?  And he's got a laptop that's just sitting on a desk perfectly, not a hint of clothing  anywhere to be seen.  Like he doesn't wait for the maid.  He does all that stuff himself.  I don't even think you allow a maid in your room, right?  No, it's not permissible. 
[00:20:30]  So you do everything yourself?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're in a hotel where people do stuff.  I know.  It's a nice luxury where you don't have to clean up your own stuff.  There's probably been nothing in a hotel that I haven't at some point or another thrown  on the floor.  Right.  It just winged at a wall or something from bed.  Sure.  You're like, I'll try for the garbage pail.  Wham!  It hits the wall.  And you don't even get upset.  Of course.  You spill something.  It's like, oh, well.  Clothes strewn everywhere on chairs, tables, the floor. 
[00:21:00]  And then when you leave, you can just throw it in a bag and you'll leave.  I've got to set a good example.  For who?  No one goes in your room.  We're too scared to go in your room, Kenny.  Set a good example for nobody.  For the other personalities in my head.  They'd probably all come out at night when there's a lot in his hotel room.  Lays there.  There's one guy that wants to be messy and then he yells at him.  That would be great. 
[00:21:30]  He's good cop, bad cop, but doesn't know it.  Yeah.  All in one.  Use conditioner.  No.  I like my dry hair.  All right, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  All right.  Thank you.  Can you throw some of the ketchup away or is that going to mess up something in your soul?  I'll bring it back so it doesn't get wasted.  I tell you what.  I'll rotate the stock based on dates.  Wait.  You're going to bring it back?  Why not just throw it away? 
[00:22:00]  It gets bad.  The hotel's not going to accept it back or the restaurant or whatever.  Oh, what do you think?  You can just bring it back and give it to guests?  Here, I took too many ketchups.  I want to return these.  All right, mister.  I put cyanide in it.  Huh?  I was a bad boy.  Took too many ketchups.  How about we save toast to it and give that back so they can decook the bread and put it back in the loaf?  Right.  Add water to the toast.  Why don't you fish in the toilet, Mr. Recycler?  This looks like a half an Oreo.  I can bring this back. 
[00:22:30]  Unbelievable.  All right.  We're just getting started here.  This is just God early.  It is just way too effing early.  Yeah.  How long does this take before this becomes part of the norm?  Like a week?  Three days?  What?  Losing the hour because of the spring ahead?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take about a week.  It was nice to have the sun out a little later, but this is the other side of it.  That just sucks.  Well, we would come in and it would be light out already.  It would start getting light out. 
[00:23:00]  It just started to get light out for us.  And now pitch black nighttime again when we come in.  We're back into the darkness.  But now it's going to stay lighter later.  Right.  Which is kind of cool.  I like that.  Absolutely.  I kind of like that.  All right.  Phone number 877-212-018.  Sometimes I'm scared of the dark.  I like some of that cornbread your wife made.  I don't know that one.  Nothing?  Green Mile?  Oh, crap.  I got to go see Green Mile now again.  That's what I was up watching last night. 
[00:23:30]  Obviously.  That's a great movie, man.  I just think you have a great memory, but I think it's just the movie that you saw the night before.  Yeah, just whatever I watched left the night before.  Right.  I watch them 8,000 times in a row.  All right.  We do the Google bomb today.  Baby diaper mustache is what you pop into Google.  Yes.  We'll have the audio from the horrific scene that went down on Friday, but there is a video  up right now on YouTube if you don't want to wait around.  Mass vomiting.  You were actually able to attain mass vomiting.  Somebody said the best part of the video is that I'm so discombobulated or whatever, 
[00:24:00]  whatever the F the word is, that I'm bumping it into walls.  When you fell on the floor, too.  That was great.  You just fell off your chair on the floor.  Because I couldn't believe how horrific it actually was.  You were trying to get away from it, but it was on you.  Right.  You're like a dog chasing his tail.  It's just, there was no solution to that problem.  And if you've seen the video, that's wonderful.  Make sure you see the pictures later today on onaradio.com because E-Rock captured a lot 
[00:24:30]  of shots.  Like, I just saw me puking for the first time.  I didn't see that picture yet.  Just a lot of behind the scenes stuff.  So, look at, look at, look at, just, look.  Oh, all red in the face.  Everyone's face is beet red from vomiting.  You hung in there pretty good, though.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't like that type of stuff.  I, uh.  See, that's.  How did it smell?  It looked like it was actually thick on your fingers. 
[00:25:00]  It was really.  It was paste.  It was, it was, it was green.  It was mostly green paste.  I love the fact you had gloves on.  Can I say that?  That's what I said.  I explained that.  Did you scale?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  We're broadcasting here.  That's hysterical.  We were talking about why would he have gloves on if he's going to put it on.  And he explained the whole thing in graphic detail.  And Jimmy's like, hey, you got gloves on.  I, because a lot of people thought it was hilarious I had gloves on considering what  I was doing, a baby diaper mustache. 
[00:25:30]  But I explained, I, I, the, the less parts of my body that had to touch this, the better.  I'm not stupid.  I didn't want it in my fingernails, too.  Jimmy, the best part of doing that is listening to the replay later.  And then you go, oh, no, that's where it's said.  And then you wait all embarrassed and hot.  Yeah.  When you, your part comes up where you go, why are you wearing gloves?  You know what it is?  I meant to ask that when I saw the video.  Of course, the first thing I noticed that you had gloves on.  Yeah.  I got, I got it.  Why?  I'm like, I would probably wear them, too.  So what was with the gloves?  You got to see the pictures. 
[00:26:00]  All these pictures were not part of the video, obviously.  This is bonus footage.  Oh, there's total, I didn't, yeah, me just staring at the diaper going, how am I going  to get this done?  That's, I mean, when you, but when you tell other people to do all your dirty work and  then you get caught like this, I had no choice.  Because people are like, wow, that was pretty cool.  I just had no choice.  I had to do it.  You had to.  All right.  Baby diaper mustache.  Let's Google bomb the hell out of that.  And you can go to YouTube, check out the video, the pictures will be up later today  on onaradio.com. 
[00:26:30]  Good morning to everybody.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate that.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What is America talking about?  About.  About.  About.  About.  About.  About.  Obama won Wyoming, huh?  Isn't that a very white state?  Yeah, he seems to be doing that.  I don't know.  Does it matter, though?  Is that a big one?  I don't know.  I don't know.  After that Super Tuesday 2, Hillary swept. 
[00:27:00]  Well, the headline is that they're starting to hint that they might be teaming up.  Although Obama's saying, hey, it's a little too early to start talking this way.  I want to be president.  But Clinton's camp is starting to push this.  Because I think they're realizing what's going to happen here.  They're going to lose this to Obama.  So now she's hinting like, ah, I think we would work very well together.  There's no way he would.  Here's what she's doing.  There's no way he would take her.  He wouldn't.  It would be a death sentence.  Yeah.  What she's doing is because she knows, like, if people vote for her, that's like, you can 
[00:27:30]  have Obama, too.  That's her way of saying, look, pick me, and you can have both.  Hey, you'll still have him, yeah.  Pick him, and you'll only get one.  But they're saying they would be unstoppable, Jimmy, together.  Yes, they would be.  In the losing, for the Republicans, they'd be unstoppable.  They would lose 50 to none.  I'm telling you, you can't just do that.  I know it sounds racist or sexist.  Too bad.  That's the reality.  It's too much.  It's too much.  You have the first black guy and the first woman all on one ticket. 
[00:28:00]  You're alienating every Republican moderate that might go over to the Democratic side  if they got maybe a moderate Republican type.  You get a lot of women, though.  Conservative as vice president.  You get a lot of women, a lot of minorities.  I don't know.  A lot of college kids.  You think?  I think the move with Obama is to get, like, old white guy.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Get some old white guy. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, probably something like that that people can relate to and go, okay, well.  Well, you know, that white people can relate to.  It's like, okay, we can almost deal with this.  Speaking of, well, I don't know.  I'm trying to do a segue here.  There's an announcer.  I want to thank AJ from the Philly crew.  He turned me on to this.  He's really starting to send some stuff our way.  There was an announcer during the, oh, this was the New York City marathon.  I thought it was the L.A. marathon. 
[00:29:00]  It is, right?  Okay.  There was an announcer for the L.A. marathon, and he makes a comment about a runner being  white.  Yeah.  And, well, after he makes his comment, there's a very long, uncomfortable silence.  Yeah.  And we have to tell you that ahead of time, because people are going to think dead air and  just, you know, turn to an oldie station.  No, no, just wait it out.  Yeah.  Just wait this out.  Listen to this.  Well, Ed, is it one of these matters where the Kenyans and Ethiopians, they say, let's 
[00:29:30]  just, let's be honest here, see a white guy out front.  They don't take him seriously.  Well, here's a look at that breakaway.  It's not really gunning it hard.  Everyone is so paranoid that that guy did not want his voice heard after that.  He sat there and just hung him out to dry.  I don't want to hear, I don't want anyone to hear me giggle. 
[00:30:00]  I don't want anyone to hear my voice.  It's just going to be you saying some remark that could be deemed racist and me keeping my  job.  That's pretty much what that guy's mindset was.  That guy, that guy is Los Angeles.  The guy who wouldn't answer that to me is, is Los Angeles.  I think it's just, unfortunately, the times we live in.  Everyone is uber paranoid, too, man.  You know?  Yeah.  Because the only thing the other guy could have said was, uh, uh, yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And then it's like, well, he agreed.  So he goes, too.  So he gets fired, too.  I just said, yeah.  No, I don't think so.  I think he just got really scared.  He just got scared and clammed up.  All he's thinking of is mortgage, his kid's college.  He's just thinking all these things and going, trick of luck.  I, uh...  Tick a lock?  I'll make believe I didn't hear what he had to say.  Zip a lip.  Well, I did a lot of running, uh, growing up.  And the fact is that, uh, that the Ethiopians and the Kenyans are the ones that are always 
[00:31:00]  in the lead of these races.  They win them.  Yeah.  They're the ones that win.  I mean, uh, a lot of marathons, the white guys go out early.  They're called, I believe, rabbits.  Oh, yeah.  And they go out really fast, but they can't keep up that pace for the whole race.  Yeah.  They, I don't know, I don't know why they, they do this, but there are, there are guys  that are known to be rabbits and they start to race really fast for everybody.  And then finally, they, they run out of energy.  They fall back.  And then it's usually the Kenyans and the Ethiopians in the lead for the rest of the race.  What small animal that might get into your garbage at night, do they call them? 
[00:31:30]  I don't, uh, I don't, it's so silly that anything you say about race, people act like race is  like never a factor in anything unless it's ethnic pride parades.  Yeah.  And then look what other people, I mean, we've made this point before.  I know I beat, I apologize.  I beat the, but I don't, but it's just, it's so unbalanced.  Yeah.  What's the matter with everybody? 
[00:32:00]  I know.  Everyone's scared.  Faggots.  Crapless.  They're just scared.  I want to hear that again though.  Long, uncomfortable silence.  Well, Ed, is it one of these matters where the, the Kenyans and Ethiopians, they say,  let's just, let's be honest here and see a white guy out front and they don't take him  seriously.  Well, here's a look at that right away.  And so front of his head was talking about, it's not really gunning it. 
[00:32:30]  Wait, did Ed talk again though?  Where's Ed?  Where's the rest of the audio?  That's pretty much it.  Oh man.  We'll have the video up on onaradio.com later today.  But that's, that is what they call deafening silence.  I think Ed took a cigarette break or something.  Kidded.  So kidded.  Absolutely.  Isn't that amazing?  Hung him out.  On the video, can you see Ed at all?  No, because it's just, you know, it's just a shot of the, the white guy leading the marathon.  There is no Ed. 
[00:33:00]  Which is a rare sight.  Especially if it's later on in the race.  If it's like, if the race just started, then what he said is completely ridiculous.  Do you think the Kenyans take him seriously?  Huh?  He's a white guy.  Absolutely not.  No, of course not.  I would say, well, you're right there.  You're right there, pal.  I understand what you mean.  The Kenyans take him as seriously in a race as he would if they were at the bank applying for a loan.  Good one. 
[00:33:30]  Back to you.  Let's say hi to Chuck the Trucker.  Chuck, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, Jimmy.  Love you guys.  Hey.  Long time listener.  First time I ever got through.  Hey, Hopi, I just wanted to ask you if you realize you invented a new character, A.J. Soopy Lip.  A.J. Poopy Lips.  Oh.  It's going to be a tough few days.  Thank you, Chuck.  I appreciate it.  Hey, you guys have a good one.  Punch it out.  All right, man.  Let's Google bomb baby diaper mustache today. 
[00:34:00]  Let's say hi to Luciant.  What's your name, sir?  Luciant.  That's really your name?  Yeah.  Wow, pretty cool.  Calling from Atlanta.  What do you got, sir?  You guys have played a bleak game with the Kenyan runner audio.  Yeah.  That'll be pretty funny.  Actually, that could be really funny.  One bleep can make that a lot funnier.  Yeah, we'll give that a shot there.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  That's a very good idea.  In other news, I mean, does anyone care that 10,000 B.C. was number one at the box office? 
[00:34:30]  No.  Not at all.  Number one at the box office, but I read on Drudge or something that said that it bombed.  What do you mean it bombed?  It was supposed to do better?  I guess.  They made $35 million.  That's big these days.  And they were like, well, it was supposed to make $40 million.  It's like, okay, well, it's not that bad.  But they put like it bombed completely.  I wonder what their angle was there.  I have no desire to see this movie.  Yeah, I'll see when it comes out on cable or something. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, of course.  I'll follow with that.  And then now the AP, in other news, the AP is finding that there are prescription drugs  in our drinking water.  Yes.  Somebody else was saying that recently, that there's so many people on pills that's affecting  our drinking water.  Now, how is that?  Like, how does it get in there?  What do you think?  Like, you think people do pills and then they go to the bathroom and then it's absorbed  into the water?  Well, and then it's recycled through, man. 
[00:35:30]  Me.  What do you think?  Every time you get a glass of water, you're drinking pure water that no one has ever touched?  No, I've seen the purification plants.  Okay.  Not a pretty sight or smell.  But, yeah, I guess the drugs are going through your body and so many of them that it's actually  detectable in the water.  That's what they're saying today.  It's got to be parts per, like, gazillion.  Oh, I'm sure.  I can make up a number.  I'm sure.  I like doing that.  Or we'd all be walking around in a daze. 
[00:36:00]  But that's how many prescription drugs there are out there.  It's affecting our drinking water.  I read a lot of the, or read, I heard on the news this morning that a lot of the drugs  are antidepressants and hormonal drugs, which is kind of scary.  So we're all going to grow boobies?  We're all going to get boobies.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Boobies.  But that is kind of odd, you know, if you're able to detect it now. 
[00:36:30]  What of the future?  How many diseases have they invented in our lifetime?  That would be a good homework assignment right there.  I just know of restless leg syndrome.  I know that's a completely made up, bogus garbage disease.  What is that one?  That's the one where you're asleep and all of a sudden your legs start moving because  it feels like they're tingling or being stuck by pins or on fire.  And then you move your legs around a lot.  That used to just be called what when we were growing up? 
[00:37:00]  Well, all I know is sometimes I have the, when you're half asleep and half awake and you  have that dream and you go to kick something and then you just wail your foot into the wall  or whoever you're sleeping with.  Well, there's a pill for that now, too.  There's got to be a pill.  So you don't kick your bedpost in.  It's called jackass partner syndrome.  But it's just pills for everything.  How about we do that for the rest of the morning?  Off and on, diseases that we invented since we were kids. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  ADD is a big one.  I know that's a big one.  And I don't even think ADD is the right term now.  It used to be like five minutes ago.  So, right.  But that was, and you know, hack comics, use that whole line and everything.  I got one.  Down syndrome.  Well, C.O.P., I think that's legit.  We just used to call them waterheads, though, when we were growing up.  And now there's a name and everything.  I don't think I ever called them waterheads. 
[00:38:00]  I called them retarded.  Yeah.  It was acceptable back in the day.  But now you can't say retarded.  No, you have to say stupid.  No, it's developmentally disabled.  Right.  But then we'll start using that because we used retarded in a nice way back in the day.  We didn't know any better.  That was fine.  And then retarded became a word that you shouldn't say for people that are retarded.  So now the word that Jimmy said or the term Jimmy said, eventually we'll use that to the point where like, oh, you can't call them that. 
[00:38:30]  And then we'll have to come up with a new name.  They can develop, so that isn't accurate.  Carl, being the genius he is, has a bit about how we remove the humanity from things by adding syllables to them.  Just what phonies we are.  He's so smart.  It's embarrassing to say you're in the same business as he is.  And he does it with shell shock.  And then he goes on to that becomes a battle fatigue, which became post-traumatic stress disorder.  We just remove the honesty and the humanity. 
[00:39:00]  And it's like, I just think of that.  It's the first thing I think of.  Now, Carl has this way of influencing the way you think in your life.  Yeah.  He's so goddamn good.  Like, retarded becomes developmentally the thing.  It's just a soft, weak.  Right.  Yeah.  And less descriptive, less blunt and to the point of what it is.  Like, shell shock was, you know, if you're being shelled and you're in a foxhole for a month, you're going to be effed up when you leave that.  Right.  But then they had to give it a nice longer name that's, you know, more people, I guess, can make money off of, more doctors treating it. 
[00:39:30]  Well, people are coming up with diseases we've invented since we were kids, like chronic fatigue.  Just used to be you were kind of overworked or overtired.  Tired.  Now it's an actual, like, disease or something.  Chronic fatigue disorder.  How about gastric reflux or whatever?  Acid reflux?  Well, look at it.  He puts gastric reflux.  Acid reflux?  Yeah.  Acid reflux was just heartburn. 
[00:40:00]  That was just like I ate too much spicy food.  And they say, my doctor told me I had acid reflux disease.  They like putting disease at the end of the word, too.  It used to just be you had the heartburn.  That's a heartburn.  He recommended a Mylanta.  Oh, really?  You couldn't just go to the store, buy some over-the-counter heartburn medication?  John P. from Connecticut's got one.  Sad.  Seasonal effect disorder.  That used to just be what? 
[00:40:30]  You're kind of bummed because summer's over?  That was pretty much what it was for me.  Oh, the seasons change and you get a little depressed because it's cold out.  Right.  Yeah.  You can't go to the beach.  You can't hang out.  It sucks going out and having a bundle up.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn A.  Sad, as it's called.  Yeah.  Seasonal effect disorder.  That is sad.  Erectile dysfunction.  E.D., they call it.  E.D.  Yes, E.D.  Now it's just E.D. because some stations don't want to carry the full name on their commercials. 
[00:41:00]  When we were kids, you didn't have E.D. out there?  You were Limp D.  E.D., it's called.  What's that?  A Noodle D.  Noodle D.  It's amazing how afraid of the human penis we are that we can't say this is something  that can help you enjoy your life more.  Yeah.  If you're having...  What is there to be ashamed of?  It's like we can't say that you're having erectile...  Why is that bad?  I mean, it sucks for an appetite.  It's so bad. 
[00:41:30]  When we were kids, it just meant Daddy doesn't like Mommy.  He likes...  He likes Blank.  That's what it used to be called.  Mommy got fat.  Right.  Yeah, it was just Mommy got fat, but now it's a disease.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I read that article over the weekend.  The thing that I found thoroughly amusing about it was where they found the hormonal drugs  was out in San Francisco.  What a shock.  Oh, there's a lot of...  There's a lot of...  Oh, really? 
[00:42:00]  Hormone.  Hormone.  It's a little early, man.  This waking up an hour earlier sucks.  Later, boys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Nigel in Kentucky.  He's got one, too.  Nigel, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  A bipolar disorder used to be known as just being a jerk.  Yeah, exactly.  Bipolar, I guess, is split personality.  Yeah.  It's called split personality.  Well, we're inventing diseases left and right. 
[00:42:30]  For the pharmaceutical companies because they haven't made enough money off us yet.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Why would anyone be calling me now when they know I'm on the radio?  It's amazing how people...  Who's calling you, Jimmy?  Who's calling you?  On the radio.  Hello?  They better be yelled at.  Jimmy's taking a phone call.  Or someone better be dead.  No, it was someone who's not there.  They hit the phone button by mistake.  Oh, I love when they do that.  That is the best.  All right, we're heading toward a break here.  Right after the break, we started talking about it when we first got here today. 
[00:43:00]  We got the baby diaper mustache on here to kind of just go over and turn people on to the video and then we'll move on.  But we want people to Google bomb baby diaper mustache today.  If you don't want to wait around, there's a fine video up on YouTube if you just punch in baby diaper mustache.  But we'll explain how it all went down on Friday after the break, okay?  But first, we go to the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[00:43:30]  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  That is F.A.R.I. from Wack Bag.  I'd like to give a big f***ing cue to my ex-girlfriend, Amanda.  Good luck finding somebody who wants to raise your kid with you, bitch.  Next message.  This F.U.s to all my students.  You can be f***ing every day.  F.U.  Next message.  Hey, it's Mike.  I want to leave a big f*** you to my girlfriend, you bitch.  We've been going out for a year.  That day you end it, you f***ing b***h. 
[00:44:00]  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is James from California.  I want to give a big f*** you to all the homeless people on Bell Street in San Francisco.  No, I don't have an extra cigarette.  And no, I don't have a dollar so you can f*** it on the bar train.  F*** you.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big f*** you to that f*** who lives over on Chopec Lane.  It's your own f***ing problem.  You buy a house on a cul-de-sac with no place to put the f***ing snow except in front of your driveway.  And my name isn't John.  It's Pete, you f***er.  I hope you'll f***ing die shoveling the snow that I'm going to bury in front of your f***ing driveway. 
[00:44:30]  Next message.  Hey, I'd like to leave a big f*** you to the idiot that thought I was waving to him at the semi-pro movie.  Hey, get out of the way.  I'm trying to catch a t-shirt.  And F you.  Next message.  Hey, what's going on?  I want to give a big f*** you to the prostitute that stole my money off the dresser after I fell asleep.  Hey, I could have put that money towards something else like another prostitute.  F*** you.  Next message.  Hi, I'd like to give a big f*** you to my cat for staring at me while I'm on the s*** and giving me the inspiration to call the FU line. 
[00:45:00]  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Lots going on this morning on the Opie and Anthony show.  Kind of got a phone topic going on right now.  Diseases that we've made up since we were kids. 
[00:45:30]  When you were a kid, there weren't much in the form of diseases.  You had cancer.  Ah, yeah.  And you had...  Chicken pox.  And chicken pox.  That's all we had growing up.  Measles.  The measles.  Oh yeah, measles too.  That was about it.  The mumps.  Oh yeah, that one too.  Yeah.  You're ruining the bit.  It's funnier to think that we only had two diseases growing up.  Just two?  You know what it was though? 
[00:46:00]  They were these legitimate horrid diseases that you would get polio.  Oh, they took care of that before we were born.  That was the plague.  Huh?  Those are legitimate kind of quick diseases.  I mean, you know, the measles, the mumps.  But all this other stuff is just emotionally based.  Yeah.  All this other stuff, none of it is, it's all like, yeah, it's kind of vague.  Very protracted.  It lasts, you know, so long that you have to keep buying this medication for years and  years and years. 
[00:46:30]  And boy, if you don't see that as being an advantage to the drug companies.  Don't get it.  And most of it you can't just take a blood test and see.  It's not like herpes or syphilis or whatever.  You have to figure it out.  Like your choice of diseases to pick.  Oh, I know.  You know, of course.  Well, you know, you can't just do a quick blood thing and figure it out.  Now, let's say hi to Herb in Cleveland.  Herb, good morning.  What's up?  Not too much.  How are you boys doing today?  Pretty good, Herb.  I got two of them.  You got IBS, which is irritable bowel syndrome, which is usually called the poopies. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And then you got ODD, which is opposite defiant disorder.  What is that one?  That's where kids will resist any orders given to them by adults or that.  It's just called lack of parenting skills by the parents.  Wait, but that's now a disease?  Like ADD?  Yes.  This is insane.  The schools have to pay attention to this.  You know, it's part of IEPs and stuff.  Basically, we're all just a little different. 
[00:47:30]  But I think the powers that be that are just this, you don't really know who they are.  They just want us all to be robots.  I think, yeah, you want to be similar and normal.  So if I'm not like Anthony or Anthony's not like me, then there's some kind of disease that makes us a little different from each other.  Yeah.  Right?  That's what it comes down to.  You want to be normal.  And then if you're a little more afraid of things than other people, then you have some kind of anxiety disorder. 
[00:48:00]  If you're a little more angry than other people, then you have anger management issues and you need to take drugs for that.  But the truth is, you're right.  Everybody's different.  Well, because the ultimate goal is to have everybody look alike and think alike.  I like that movie.  And have the same emotions.  So Twilight Zone like that one.  Well, but that's where we're heading toward.  Are we?  Yes.  Sometime in the future?  Yes.  Just tan people. 
[00:48:30]  Now, we're moving towards this really weird thing where you're right.  People are all going to be the same.  It's like when you picture aliens.  They're always pictured as the same.  Computers are, I'm telling you, give it 500 years.  Computers and people are going to be melded somehow.  Like you have chips to help you do everything.  I like that.  Sameness is going to be the thing as a planetary species.  You're going to look back on individuality as a growth spurt problem.  Wow.  I guarantee it.  Because you watch.  Like the way we look at Cro-Magnon man with his dumb ridges and going to the bathroom and hitting somebody with a club. 
[00:49:00]  That's the way we're going to look at individuality and these weird personality traits someday.  Because we're all going to be linked through probably computers.  We're all going to be linked mentally anyway.  And then if people display individuality, then they'll be weird and have to be killed, I believe.  Because you'll be fighting the collective.  Yes.  Yeah.  We're heading toward that.  Let's say hi to Keith in Pennsylvania.  Keith.  No.  Yeah.  Hey.  Now we have PMDD.  We no longer have PMS.  It's premenstrual dysphoric disorder. 
[00:49:30]  What is that?  Women are very, very, very depressed when it's that time of the month for them.  So are we.  We.  I almost got it out.  Right.  Is there a pill for us?  We're the ones that truly suffer.  Yeah.  Cyanide.  Put it in your mouth and make it bite down.  I guess it gets them out of prison easier when they kill us at that time.  There you go.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Gary in D.C.  Gary, what's up?  Fibromyalgia.  Have you ever heard of that?  What is that? 
[00:50:00]  My mother-in-law has had it for like 10 years.  It's basically body soreness.  Just body soreness?  She doesn't exercise.  She just sits around and she's complained about body pain for the last 10 years.  So the doctors told her she had fibromyalgia.  No, it just means you're a little dehydrated.  Drink a little more water and you'll be fine.  Is that not a real?  I think my sister has something like where she's sore a lot.  Well, I expected something horrific to be said. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, right.  I was holding back, Jimmy, because I have a sister and I don't want you making fun of mine.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Just sit around on the couch.  All right.  Let's say hi to Graham in Wisconsin.  Graham, what's up?  Yeah, so we did ED and ADD, but you're forgetting about STP.  Linger.  STP.  STP.  What the hell, dude?  All right, E-Rock. 
[00:51:00]  Let's say hi to Kansas.  What's up, Kansas?  Hello?  Kansas.  You.  Clinical depression.  You.  You.  What's going on, guys?  I'm so depressed.  Are you calling from Kansas?  No, I'm calling from Danvers.  My name's Adam.  How's it going?  Oh, my God.  Danvers.  Who heard that is Kansas?  Well, the girl answering the phones did.  Oh, that lady.  Also known as Travis.  What do you got, sir?  Well, I'm just thinking clinical depression back in the day used to be called your life sucks. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  You know, it was really all it was.  There's a name for everything, guys.  Yeah, maybe you didn't have the job you wanted, a relationship, things like that, and you  were sad or bummed out about it for a while, for a period of time until things got better.  Yeah, if you went to your parents and said, I'm feeling a little sad, they'd be like, go outside and play and get some fresh air, you'll feel better.  Get in the sunlight.  Get in the sun.  They didn't, like, take you to a doctor for some kind of, like, treatment. 
[00:52:00]  No.  I remember when I was a little.  This guy's got yappy, yappy-itis.  What do you got, Jimmy?  When I was a little boy, I remember my parents took me to a therapist because they, uh, my  hyperactivity was a bit out of control.  Yeah.  Like, the firemen came to the school and I was jumping in and out of their boots.  Oh, did they have to go, Jimmy, Jimmy?  Yeah, it was awful.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Yeah, or I went to the firehouse and I was just stepping in and out of their boots and  they took me and, uh, I was just sitting there and I thought that I was adopted. 
[00:52:30]  I was like, you're not adopted.  I look just like my father.  It's creepy how much you look like your father.  Why would you think you were adopted, Jimmy?  I was what we call a horse's patoot.  I was like, am I adopted?  I don't know.  It's just like a.  I think we all secretly hope that we were adopted.  Hope?  I think we all secretly hope that, like, your real father's going to come along and  he's not like some kind of superhero.  He's wealthy.  Wealthy.  Owns a yacht.  Perfect human specimen. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  I kind of thought my dad was pretty cool.  Yeah.  Uh, early on, you know, until the spaghetti incidents and things like that.  But, you know, it was kind of cool.  Yeah.  Private eye kind of a thing.  That's pretty cool.  He was an investigator.  Come home.  Had a gun.  And, you know, wore a gun and a shoulder holster.  He was one of those guys.  That was kind of cool.  Yeah, right on.  I was like, wow.  My dad's like Mannix.  And then, uh.  He was a PI, your dad?  He was everything for a period of time. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, wow.  Believe me.  Drug dealer.  Whatever it took.  Whatever it took to get the spaghetti on the wall.  He was old school.  Yeah.  I put food on the wall for my family.  My table.  Oh, I stink.  I almost had it perfect.  You got so close to that one.  I know.  I was this close to it being perfect.  What is a string of food on the table?  Those were polo ponies.  Where?  We were discussing it during the commercial.  We're a little off today.  Our rhythm's a little off because there's dumb daylight savings time. 
[00:54:00]  How about we just keep it as is?  And then it just becomes what it is.  All right, everybody.  Put your clocks back.  But why do we have to like.  Back where they were.  Why do we have to spring ahead, fall back, whatever the hell?  Why?  There's no reason for it anymore.  Mind control.  We're not farmers.  I know because we talk to a lot of farmers.  But in general, we're not farmers.  Yeah, Ben Franklin came up with this.  Did he?  Yeah.  For what reason?  I'm sure it was an old reason that we've outgrown as a nation.  We're here to dry your white socks when there's more daylight. 
[00:54:30]  It's the best I could come up with.  I should be fired and shot.  Stupid white knicker socks.  Let's go to Dan in Jersey.  Dan.  Yeah, guys.  With all due respect to Jimmy's sister, that fibromyalgia thing is totally a crock.  I'm a massage therapist.  We call it the whiny pants disease.  Whiny pants?  Why the.  Yeah, it's actually, yeah, because there's only like 10 questions that the doctor asks.  And if the person asks five of those questions, a certain way you have fibromyalgia, there's 
[00:55:00]  no way to.  It's also a tension horde disease.  Well, what do you get for it?  Do you get a pill for this?  I don't know if that's the one she had or not.  I've heard that name before.  No, there's no pill.  No, it's just, it's actually just pain in certain areas and you can basically request  time off, leave.  You can take off from work, whatever, what have you.  And what can you say to it?  You say, well, it has fibromyalgia, nothing you can do about it.  Right.  I don't think there's any pain tells us. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Whiny pants disease.  That's really funny.  Robin in Detroit.  Robin.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Robin.  Never heard of this one before.  Body dysmorphic disorder.  Yep, I've heard of that one.  Yeah, you look in the mirror and you think you're fat or something.  Well, that and people have actually thought, I shouldn't have a white leg and they want  to get their leg cut off.  So let them cut their leg off.  Who cares?  It kind of diseases that.  If you want to cut your leg off, then cut your leg off.  It makes it so entertaining for the rest of us. 
[00:56:00]  Pay-per-view.  Yeah, exactly.  Just do it for YouTube or something.  There you go.  Thank you, Robin.  Thanks.  All right.  We're Google bombing baby diaper mustache.  Let's get into this a little bit.  Jimmy missed the festivities.  Jimmy wrote me a text and I couldn't even talk to him over the weekend.  I was embarrassed.  Oh.  I was a little embarrassed by my shenanigans on Friday.  Why?  I was feeling a little embarrassed.  Jimmy wrote me a text.  He was like, first of all, Omar on Wednesday.  And then second of all, baby diaper mustache. 
[00:56:30]  And then you wrote something like awesome or some kind of adjective.  Yes, it was a good text.  Yeah, it was a very good text.  But Jimmy, these guys got me really bad on Friday.  Friday, as you know, every once in a while, I'll jump on the air and go, all right, today,  baby diaper mustache.  But I don't give people time to actually come down with a baby and a diaper to actually pull  off baby diaper mustache, which we want you to Google bomb today.  Well, Friday, these guys were in cahoots together and they called Rich Voss.  And this is where it starts. 
[00:57:00]  On Friday, you guys didn't hear it on this side of the show, but during a commercial break,  I go to Steve, you know, this baby diaper mustache thing.  I want to make it a thing.  Like every once in a while.  A thing.  Every once in a while, we'll throw this exciting radio sweeper on the air like baby diaper mustache.  Pew, pew, choo, choo.  And we give people barely enough time to actually run down to the station with a full diaper.  And the gag will be that I never do baby diaper mustache.  No, you're supposed to not give them enough time to get down here. 
[00:57:30]  It's hard to whip up that quickly and come down to the studio.  The mistake I made on Friday was explaining that I want a sweeper done for baby diaper mustache  that I was going to play later, much later on on the show.  Yeah, you left enough time there by doing that for the staff.  And then Anthony and I go back on the air thinking nothing of it.  Later on, we're going to like reveal that it's baby diaper mustache day.  What I didn't know was as soon as we went back in the air,  E-Rock and I believe Steve got together and went, oh my God, call Rich Voss now.  He's got a newborn. 
[00:58:00]  He could be at the station within an hour.  I had no idea.  When I saw Rich at the door to the studio, I knew.  You did not?  That it was up for you.  Because he's never done that.  Rich has never just popped in like that.  Right.  So he had to be there for a reason.  And it was baby diaper.  Well, so this is how it started.  Here's the big sweeper promo that we want to throw in the air.  It's baby diaper mustache day on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:58:30]  Have you ever looked at your baby's diaper and thought, hmm, that belongs on a man's face?  Do you have a stinky baby?  Do you want to see Opie wear a baby mustache?  Hurry because you have less than two hours to get you and your stinky baby to the Opie and Anthony show studios.  That's right.  Show up here with your little rat and Opie will personally apply a heaping helping of your baby's green to his upper lip.  This promotion ends at exactly 11 a.m.  So if you and your stinking baby show up at 1101, you can go the f***ing home. 
[00:59:00]  Baby must be yours.  Must be baby's.  Baby must be in the presence of Opie.  Diaper must be clean prior to baby.  This offer is null and worse at the end of today's live broadcast.  Go f*** yourself.  So Steve made that and called Rich Voss at the same time.  So I throw this little promo on the air like, ha ha, watch what I do.  Look how brave I am.  And then Rich Voss did show up.  And here's a clip I want to play from Friday's show.  I think this clip is when Rich showed up in studio. 
[00:59:30]  Because then I see Rich at the door.  You had no doubt in your mind that he came for this thing?  Yeah, at that point I knew.  Really?  Because then I thought I was off the hook because I'm thinking, all right, this is just a coincidence.  He had some kind of audition, wanted to stop by and say hi.  Because he played it pretty good.  Like, what are you talking about?  But he never comes by.  Here's a clip from Friday's show.  Just popping in.  It's relentless.  Well, Matt LaF*** went, well, Jesus Christ, what the f*** is he doing here?  Oh, my God, please.  Oh, no! 
[01:00:00]  All right, I know what the f***.  I know what the f*** he did.  My heart just stopped.  Yes, and it should.  Do you have Bonnie and the baby?  First of all, I always have part of Bonnie and the baby with me, whether they're here or not.  Okay?  So what are you saying?  Do I have Bonnie?  Do you see Bonnie with me, stupid?  Oh, I'm breathing.  Do you understand?  I would love f***ing no idea.  Do you understand?  What?  You have no idea, do you, stupid?  Holy crap.  He has no clue.  What?  My heart, I'm not even joking, just stopped.  What's that?  Can you please play it for him? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, God.  All right, I'll play this for you.  It's very obvious he has no clue and I'm off the hook.  So I'm still thinking, okay, oh my God, I dodged a bullet.  Okay.  Yeah, you think you're safe.  And it's already like less than an hour, less than an hour left in the radio show.  I'm like, okay, oh my God, this isn't happening.  And then the big reveal, Rich Voss did indeed bring a baby diaper with him and he had it  in his coat pocket in a plastic bag.  I'm breathing now.  I saw your face like you just happened to be in town, maybe at a doctor's office or something. 
[01:01:00]  Like, holy s*** going down today.  So you're saying you would take baby...  Yeah, but here's...  Rich, I just surprised people out of nowhere.  It turns into baby diaper mustache day.  Today happens to be one of those days.  And the odds of it actually happening are slim.  But when we saw your face at the door, I'm like, oh my...  Yeah, c*** somebody that would have been listening.  Because you have stopped by with the baby, too, before.  You know, here's the thing, though.  I mean, there's so many rules to this thing, you know.  The bottom line is you would take baby... 
[01:01:30]  ...and put it under here.  Yeah.  Get the hell out of here.  You'd make a little mustache with baby...  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  It's f***ing...  F***ing my audition!  F***ing you!  I don't f***ing you!  Okay.  Oh, it's f***ing mean.  Oh, Bobby's puking.  Bobby's puking.  Get him a pail.  Oh, f***ing.  Get him a pail. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, that's funny, man.  We sure curse a lot.  We sure do.  Ah!  So, he reveals that he did bring a diaper with him, throws it on the console.  Everyone starts freaking out.  Bob Kelly runs to a garbage pail, starts puking.  We're going to have all those pictures up later on onaradio.com.  We still haven't posted them.  There's another, by the way, there's another disease you forgot to mention called foot and  mouth disease.  Poor mouth.  Not mouth.  Foot and mouth.  That is the best example of somebody setting themselves up I've ever heard in my life. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, I know.  You couldn't have, like, more perfectly entrapped.  You painted yourself in a little corner.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Because that's what I had to explain to my girl.  I'm like, I had no choice.  I'm being this cocky guy in the air saying, hey, you bring a baby diaper by, I will absolutely  do this, knowing that I'm not really giving people enough time to do this.  So, the only way this was going to be done was how it went down Friday.  Yeah.  My own guys in cahoots with each other.  The only out you had was to say, no, no, no, you have to bring the baby. 
[01:03:00]  I didn't say baby diaper.  Right.  I said it has to be a baby.  Because the promo says bring your baby.  Well, we kind of, you know, it's funny you should say that, because even after we played  the promo, Jimmy, I go, because I think Anthony or someone said that, and I'm like, ah, I'll  work around the rules.  You go, I'll work around those rules.  Like, thinking, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Rules, no rules.  Yeah, you're right, Jimmy, but I couldn't even use that as an out.  Are you kidding me?  Our fans would have crucified me.  Yes, they would have.  So, I'm sitting there going, I got to freaking do this now. 
[01:03:30]  And I'm like, I got to do this now.  I put on the gloves, and I open up this thing that Voss brought, and I'm staring, and I'm  like, where do I go?  Like, there's no whipped cream in here.  So, I'm trying to figure out what part was the easiest part to do, and there was no easy  part.  You know what it looked like?  It looked like a spinach and feta omelet that a truck tire squished.  It was horrendous.  Yeah, I don't think the video, which is up on YouTube right now, you don't really see 
[01:04:00]  a lot of what's in the diaper, but the pictures that Erock took that will be up on ONARadio.com.  Are they up now or later on?  Oh, they're up on ONARadio.com.  Well, that's the site that everyone goes to.  Well, the pictures are up on a website we're not allowed to promote, but...  How come they didn't go right up on this site?  Which one?  On ONARadio.com?  Huh?  We have to do it later.  The guy's not in.  You have to wait for him?  Yeah.  Why couldn't we do it Friday?  Because he didn't have them on Friday. 
[01:04:30]  Why wouldn't they have them on Friday?  Oh, boy.  We didn't give it to them on Friday.  Yeah, we got a very lazy staff.  We really do.  Those pictures should have been up Friday, because that's when this whole thing went  down, so people, when they hear something crazy on the radio, they're immediately searching  for you.  So now it's Monday, and we're going to finally put the pictures up on ONARadio.com.  Very lazy staff.  Very lazy.  Jeez.  Enjoy your time here, because you guys aren't going to be superstars in this business.  Wow. 
[01:05:00]  Spuds Buckley would have had those pictures up immediately.  What do you have...  I'd love to hear his voice.  I missed Friday's installment, by the way.  Not to...  I did miss Friday's installment, because I was really...  I didn't give anybody a taste of Spuds Buckley on Friday.  But you promised.  Well, I did, but I...  Well, we got the old school Spuds Buckley, the one we heard a couple of times already.  Yeah, well...  You know.  All right, I'll just...  La, la, la, la, la, la.  I got Bear Man going, whoa, hey.  Hey, hey, ho, boy.  Here it is.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, no, no. 
[01:05:30]  Good morning, Bear Man.  You want another taste today?  No.  I have to.  But G, what G, bars?  What?  Well, can we have one more time with that?  I just didn't hear it, because God intervened and shut my hearing down.  Mercifully.  Fudgy, wudgy, bars.  What's that?  Fudgy, wudgy, wudgy?  Fudgy, wudgy, bars.  What's wrong with that?  Ladies and gentlemen, put them together for Spuds Buckley. 
[01:06:00]  A Buckley?  Who's that?  Ladies and gentlemen, put them together for Spuds Buckley.  That's my pal, Bear Man, who does mornings in Allentown.  Oh, boy.  That's all you get for now.  No.  For now.  No.  For now.  For now.  No.  No.  We're in the middle of baby diaper mustache.  No.  I'll roll up a newspaper and hit your nose.  No.  So, uh...  Oh, my God.  We've got to finish the baby diaper mustache thing. 
[01:06:30]  I've got one more clip to play.  You're only playing that Spuds right now, by the way.  He's a very smart dude, because he knows that this is going to overshadow it.  So, the audio was played, but the deliciousness under the nose will overshadow it.  Look, if people remember, then we'll give them a little taste later on or tomorrow or something.  But there you go.  We've got to finish the baby diaper mustache storyline here.  Do we?  So, then they hand over the diaper to me, and I put the gloves on, and I'm trying to figure out where am I going to go. 
[01:07:00]  Where in this diaper can I go?  Is there a safe area in this thing?  And there wasn't.  So, I just had to dig in and do it.  And finally, here's how it went down on Friday.  Once again, this is called baby diaper mustache.  One, two, three.  One, two, three.  Oh!  Oh, oh.  One, two, three, dude.  Oh, babe!  Oh!  Oh, no!  Oh, my God, no! 
[01:07:30]  Oh, no!  He fell on the floor!  He fell on the floor!  He did it!  He took two fingers, wiped it right under his nose.  Now he can't get the smell out of his head.  Oh, no, he's got the diaper in his hand! 
[01:08:00]  Where is he?  He's going.  All right, he's running off to the bathroom.  Holy s***!  Wow.  And that's it right there?  A little taste of what happened on Friday.  Dude, I bow to you.  That was...  I saw the video.  I was watching that video like a fan.  I hadn't seen it.  No, you haven't seen it yet. 
[01:08:30]  No, I did when I watched it because I wasn't in the studio when it happened.  And I'm like, you're not going to do this.  No.  I had no choice.  I really...  I didn't think you were going to do that.  When you tell all these other guys to do all this horrific stuff for your radio show  and you guys, you know, and we get the credit for it, it wouldn't have been fair  if I didn't do it at that point.  Look at that.  Oh, God.  I can't even look at that picture.  The pictures will be up on onaradio.com hopefully later on this afternoon.  They are up on the website.  We are not allowed to promote.  That's named after the radio show. 
[01:09:00]  And the video is now up on YouTube for your viewing pleasure.  Pleasure.  And also, we're hoping everyone Google bombs baby diaper mustache today and makes it  number one.  The number one search in America today will be baby diaper mustache.  Do it up.  So, it was horrific.  And then, like, I knew, you know, I was being videotaped, obviously, so I'm like, all right,  I have to do this, and now I have to present to the camera, and I'm hanging there, and  I'm trying to count my head, one, one hundred.  I was trying to get to three.  I don't know if I did.  And then, all hell just broke loose. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  The smell, I started...  Well, at that point, I started dry heaving.  I fell down.  Yeah, for some reason, you decided you had to get up on your knees on the chair or something,  and then you just fell off of your chair.  Well, because I was shaking before I did it, the adrenaline rush I was getting, and then  the smell on top of it, I just, I almost passed out.  Not just from the smell, just from the whole excitement of the thing.  Bobby was smart, too, because I watched that, and he kept going, one, two, three, and, like,  you kept moving towards it. 
[01:10:00]  That was a smart move by him, too, I just, because that's how we do it.  Yeah, yeah, getting all pumped up.  He was nervous, too.  He just wanted it done.  And I, it was like, I don't remember exactly, but it was like two or three, like, failed  attempts.  Yeah, you almost, you came close.  I'm going, I can't do this.  Like, one, two, three, and then you get close, and then back off.  So, there you go.  Go to YouTube, check it out for yourself.  We'll get the views up on YouTube before the end of the day.  The pictures are hilarious. 
[01:10:30]  The pictures that E-Rock took are much better than the video, I think.  Yeah.  Because it tells more of the story, like, the faces, look at how, look, that's after  I wiped it off, and it looks like I have a full mustache still on, because it got stuck  in my.  Oh, it had stubble.  It got stuck in my stubble.  And then, didn't you shave in the bathroom?  No.  Oh, you waited?  I had to wait until I got home.  I ran home.  Like, you guys hung out.  I was like, God, that would be crazy to shave it with that in there.  No, you guys hung out after the show and had a few beers.  I had to get right home. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  I could not stick around.  I couldn't wait to get home and take a really long rape shower.  Just in the bottom of the shower crying.  Oh, my God.  I scrubbed my face.  Like, I can't even tell you how many times I've scrubbed my face between Friday and today.  It's off.  I can't even tell you.  It's off.  Even this morning, I was still, like, just reworking the area.  Like, I feel like it's still there.  I don't, it's not, it doesn't smell, none of that crap.  But I just got the feeling I'm just not clean yet.  Look at me, just looking at the diaper there, going, how am I going to do this? 
[01:11:30]  It looks like, it really looks like a sandwich of some sort.  Like on panini bread.  Panini.  It's horrendous.  So, there you have it.  So, let's Google bomb the hell out of baby diaper mustache today.  I'd rather open a package with Luca Bronsi's vest in it than that.  It'd smell better.  Dude, that is filthy.  Pretty amazing, huh, Jimmy?  Horrendous.  Truly horrendous.  It was a perfect storm that hit on Friday, really.  These guys set me up. 
[01:12:00]  Perfect storm in that diaper.  And then I'm sitting there, I'm like, how?  I was thinking to myself, what's my out here?  Because I really still, I didn't want.  Doing it.  I was thinking maybe if I throw it at Bobby, that'll get a really big laugh.  Yeah.  Smear it on E-Rock's face.  I'm thinking of all these things in my head.  Like, all right, maybe I could do something that I will be off the hook.  And people will go, wow, that was amazing radio.  And then I'm thinking, I'm like, none of this is going to get me off the hook.  I have to freaking do this.  No, you had to do it.  You had to do it.  I have to do this. 
[01:12:30]  Well, there you have it.  Better you than me.  Oh, you wouldn't do that.  I would.  Oh, my God.  But you were a trooper, though.  Well, you know why?  Because I couldn't smell it.  I was in an area, I guess, that wasn't, it wasn't wafting over to me.  And I had the Lysol anyway with the paper towel.  So if, but if I smelt it, I might have been a little more heebie-jeebied out.  I suggest that somebody joins my exclusive club down the road.  I'll give it a little time.  We'll give it a little time. 
[01:13:00]  Exclusive club?  My exclusive club.  I'll join yours if you join mine.  No!  If you give yourself old silo mouth.  It's Ant's turn.  It's Ant's turn.  No.  Ant wouldn't do anything like that.  What am I going to do like that?  He'll come up with something else, but he can't do that.  I think, Jimmy, you should come up with a cute little thing that is almost impossible to do  because you don't give the listeners enough time.  That was the beauty of this, not giving the listeners enough time to actually come by. 
[01:13:30]  So you throw out some kind of a thing out there.  A crazy thing.  Knowing that the odds are minuscule.  But the beauty of the bit is you're the only one that knows when you're going to like pop it on the show.  Like, all right, today, today only, for the next hour, if you come by with blank, I will do this.  That's the bit, if you can think of one.  I got one.  Really?  It's kind of gross.  But if a girl comes by with double D breasts or bigger, I will put my face in them and make the noise. 
[01:14:00]  Wow, you're going out on a limb.  That's right.  But it's only good from now until a week from Thursday.  And then it's extended.  All right, there you have it.  The video's up on YouTube, like we've been saying.  Baby diaper mustache.  O.P. and Anthony, stay there.  This doesn't make sense.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  People are now seeing baby diaper mustache for the first time on YouTube. 
[01:14:30]  Some saying it's the funniest thing they've never seen.  Some saying it's the grossest thing they've never seen.  Disgusting, yes.  A lot of people are just saying, why?  Why, why, why?  Yeah.  And continue Google bombing, baby.  Typer mustache for the show today.  We'll have the number one search in America today.  Phone number 877-212.  It's O&A.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:15:00]  What the hell is this?  Sounds very 80s.  Yeah, it kind of has.  Well, that whole 80s sound is definitely coming back.  Yep.  It's in a lot of music these days.  Retro.  Where's Camp Lickalotta?  What is it?  What?  I lost my Camp Lickalotta.  Where is it?  There we go. 
[01:15:30]  You got to hear this news story.  Camp Lickalotta.  There's a lesbian couple.  Yeah.  They want to start a gay camp.  A gay camp.  So, a happy, fun camp is what...  No.  Uh-huh.  A camp for gay people.  I thought you meant happy and fun.  No.  Gay.  Well, that word took a turn, didn't it?  An exclusive camp for the gay. 
[01:16:00]  For a gay and lesbian or just a lesbian?  For the gay.  The gay.  The gay.  Let's go to the news story.  And listen to the news, man.  Just, like, doesn't even break a sweat.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Nothing fazes this guy.  He's just reading.  Just listen to what he reads here.  The co-founders of a controversial camp.  The co-founders.  Oh, my God.  What?  The co-founders.  The co-founders.  Let's just do a jump in. 
[01:16:30]  Of the co-founders.  Of the co-founders.  It was like something just got pulled out.  Of the co-founders.  I think she's in a panic.  I think she's thinking, oh, no, I might have to do baby diaper mustache today.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to get this over and over again.  Steve in White Plains.  Yes, Steve.  Yeah, I just wanted to call you out, Opie, because I think the whole thing is fake.  Ah.  Think what you want, my friend.  I'm not even going to play that game. 
[01:17:00]  That's like, Steve, it's fake.  If you think it's fake.  Actually, someone at FH Riley's, somebody, a friend from Brooklyn, he goes, look, you  can tell me.  Was there pudding in that diaper?  I'm like, no, man.  It was the real deal.  If there's pudding, you could have done something really disgusting.  Oh, I would have just smeared the whole diaper on my face or something, right?  That would be the bit.  Sing mammy.  Mammy.  Mammy.  Why do you think the video's fake there, Steve?  I'll humor you for a second.  Well, my thought is that right after the promo, when the promo says that baby must be present, 
[01:17:30]  baby must whatever, Opie immediately said that he would do it without the baby, because  he knew Voss was on his way there without the baby, with this fake diaper of poo in his  pocket.  Ah.  I did not know that Voss was on his way.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So how am I...  But know what someone said, which made me a little sad?  They're like, it obviously is real, because we all know Opie's not a really good actor. 
[01:18:00]  Just look at the Opie and Anthony TV commercial.  That made me very sad.  They're like, that convinced me that this was real, because no one could act like that.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Mr. Faber-Sham, especially Opie, because he's a bad actor.  Thank you, Steve.  But I'm just...  I gotta tell you, it was as real as it gets.  That's the beauty of this whole thing.  Thank you, sir.  And I can't...  Beauty has no part in this.  I can't fake dry heaving.  I can't fake the looks on my face.  You see the diaper in the pictures that E-Rock is gonna post. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, that would be a hell of a...  How do you figure out how to make it look like that?  Props department from Industrial Light and Magic.  Look at Bob Kelly.  You think it's fake now?  Look at the video.  This red head.  His beet red, puking head.  Yeah.  Look at the video.  There goes Rich Voss.  He's the father.  He's puking.  And we all know that.  We all know Voss can't act.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:19:00]  If Ope tried to fake that, no, absolutely no way would Bob Kelly and Rich Voss have allowed  him to get away with that or pulled it off.  No.  This wasn't just like Opie in a room.  I watched it, and I knew because my first thought was, well, did he do it?  I mean, of course you're gonna ask that.  Yeah.  Voss and Bobby being there and Ant being there, there's no way it was fake.  And I'm not saying this to be part of the radio show, dude.  You're wrong if you think it was fake.  He did something tremendously disgusting.  Just awful. 
[01:19:30]  I mean, look at the video yourself.  I can't even touch this stuff, and I'm making weird gestures with my finger that you would  do because you're about to start reaching into a diaper like that.  And I completely have the heebie-jeebies.  Even watching it now, I'm cringing.  Yeah.  Baby diaper mustache.  Google bomb it today.  And check it out for yourself on YouTube.  You know what?  If you think it's fake, what am I gonna tell you?  What am I gonna say?  I mean, I think it's pretty obvious. 
[01:20:00]  There'll always be people that think it's fake.  It's online.  It's gotta be...  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's fake.  That's fake.  And then you just start dry heaving.  The second it goes on there, you try for about two seconds to hold your composure.  The other part that pretty much proves that it's not fake is, first of all, when I'm walking  back from the bathroom, I bump into the walls, and then I'm just sitting in the chair at  the end of the video, and I'm wiping tears from my eyes because it just was that disgusting. 
[01:20:30]  And this is what you do, too.  So you jump up with the diaper, and you go to a...  I know you were gonna do something with it.  He was looking for E-Rock.  He was gonna mush it in someone's face.  And then you just threw it out.  Like, you had to get to the bathroom.  That was a weird part of the video.  There you go.  With the diaper watch.  And, like, you're doing something with that diaper.  Oh, if you would have shoved that in E-Rock's face.  And you just threw it out.  Yeah, because everyone ran away.  You just threw it out.  I mean, if...  Eh, whatever.  Think what you want.  But, I mean, everyone ran away because they didn't want to be anywhere near that diaper. 
[01:21:00]  Steve from Bayshore?  Yeah.  I love what he calls Bob Kelly.  He goes, Blobby.  He calls him Blobby.  Blobby was so nauseated, he was hardly able to finish a ninth lunch after the show.  Let's say hi to Joe.  All right, dude.  I get it.  I'm fat.  All right.  All right, dude.  I get it.  Dad.  Joe.  Me.  Joe in Jersey.  What's up?  I lost him.  Okay.  Anyway, let's get back to the story.  There's a camp out there for lesbians.  Yeah.  And here's the newswoman again, jumping right to the story. 
[01:21:30]  The co-founders of a controversial camp...  Oh, look.  ...about the fight to make their...  Huh?  Oh, the co-founders.  Oh, the co-founders.  Oh, the co-founders.  Who talks like that?  Not one.  The co-founders.  The co-founders of a controversial camp...  ...speak out about the fight to make their dream a reality.  Camp Lickalotta is stirring up a lot of content.  He's trying so hard to not say it like it's supposed to be said. 
[01:22:00]  He's like, Camp Lickalotta.  Lickalotta.  It's Camp Lickalotta.  Camp Lickalotta.  You were 12 years old once.  Come on.  Yeah, just blurt it out.  Camp Lickalotta.  Lickalotta.  Dream a reality.  Camp Lickalotta is stirring up a lot of controversy in the Golden Valley region of Rutherford County.  That's where the co-founders plan to open the gay-friendly campsite.  But that's easier said than done.  Well, Nancy Levy and Joni Beasley say in spite of threats received from residents and being evicted off the property where they had originally hoped to open the camp, 
[01:22:30]  Camp Lickalotta will open somewhere.  Somewhere.  I bet.  Yeah.  That guy seems like he's looking for a membership, too.  Why would you call it Camp Lickalotta if you're trying to go legit?  Of course.  They're trying to be a little outrageous.  Or what?  They're just trying to get the name out there?  I think any time you get something like that, like, you know, some of the clubs, the manhole, the ramrod, things like that. 
[01:23:00]  You got to make a name so that it's pretty obvious something's going on.  Like, I'll give you an example.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar in Brooklyn, and it was called the Caddyshack, but it was spelt C-A-T-T-Y.  Wait, did you really go to a lesbian bar this weekend? 
[01:23:30]  Oh, I thought you were just going to brush over that part.  Hell no.  Did you really?  Yes, I did.  Why?  It was hysterical.  What is wrong?  Dude, it was so funny.  Seeing these women dressed like men.  Like, just dressed like guys.  And they're with some girls that kind of looked all right, but for the most part, it was just, I went with friends.  And they were just...  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, hello?  Yeah, wait, wait.  Well, you all know you're single now.  Uh-huh.  And now you're going to lesbian bars in Brooklyn?  Yeah, because it was kind of funny.  Do you go with girls or guys?  What do you think?  Guys.  Yeah, of course.  I'm going to go with girls.  It's just a way to slowly introduce yourself to the gay community.  To the gay community.  See, first, I go lesbian.  I'll start with women that sort of look like guys.  And then before you know it, I'm dressed like Pacino in Cruisin'. 
[01:24:30]  Wait, so you went to a lesbian bar in Brooklyn?  Yeah.  Called the Caddyshack, and they spell it C-A-T-T-Y.  Yeah.  Meow.  And then, yeah, there's girls in there that you could swear from the back are dudes.  Like, they dress like guys, and then they're at the bar kind of, you know, hooking up.  And then there's this big just butch woman behind the bar, and she's arm wrestling like guys that are there. 
[01:25:00]  It was just this scene of, I don't know, and they're all dancing together.  Wait, you went from being a recluse to going to lesbian bars in Brooklyn?  Yeah, I'm out.  What the hell's going on with you?  Like Ronnie said, the wheels are off.  The wheels are definitely off.  I'm just having fun.  So what, some of the girls you were with?  Yeah.  Do they go that way?  No, no, it's just that...  But you knew about a place called the Caddyshack. 
[01:25:30]  Well, I didn't know about it.  I was told about it.  They knew.  Yeah.  Because friends of theirs frequent the place.  So I went, and it was funny.  And then downstairs, there's a chick dancing on a bar.  They have a pole on the bar.  And there's kind of, you know, a hot chick dancing up there for the girls to look at.  It's like they look, so they could stare at this girl dancing up there while they're dressed like men. 
[01:26:00]  Which is the hottest thing, because they want everything.  Everything except the penis part of a guy.  Like, it's obvious.  They like them with the hats and the big flannel jacket, ties and suits.  Complete short hair.  And then, it's just...  Jimmy's in shock.  Jimmy hasn't talked in five minutes.  Because I don't understand.  How about a library? 
[01:26:30]  What?  I don't know your...  There's no lesbians at a library?  It's like these weird places.  Are you into lesbians?  No, no, no.  I was just...  Like, butch lesbians?  No, no, no, no.  It sounds like there were no lipstick lesbians there.  No, maybe a couple.  But it was just kind of, you know, the people I was with were meeting somebody that was hanging out there.  Queet.  That might be of the lesbian persuasion.  And then, to be there and hang out, it was kind of fun and entertaining to just watch and see what goes on. 
[01:27:00]  And...  It's so funny.  One guy was there, and I guess he was a friend of people.  That my friends knew.  And it was...  He was supposed to be, you know, and trying to talk up the fact that he was straight.  And, no, it wasn't working.  Yeah, my girlfriend.  While your radar was up?  Straight.  Oh, the gaydar detector went off like it did in my tree fort. 
[01:27:30]  I, out of habit, just started going...  Yeah, it was amazing, though, you know.  I'm enjoying it.  I was immersed in the whole scene.  It's kind of interesting to see.  Like, just at the bar, hanging out.  And you think it's a guy and a girl.  And then you look and go, holy crap, that's a girl.  Just like a guy.  It's like a dude. 
[01:28:00]  They strap everything down.  They put on, like, 15 sports bras that are too tight.  Just get rid of those filthy breasts that you know you don't want.  Angry at those breasts.  I just don't get it.  If you dislike men so much, they emulate everything about men.  It's like, stop it.  But I realized that they don't dislike men.  They dislike the penis.  Because everything else is manly about these girls.  Everything.  It's just a mask.  The way they walk.  Like, you don't even notice. 
[01:28:30]  When they go walking past you to go to the bathroom or something.  That walk is nothing but this man walk.  The shoulders are kind of out.  They're like, yeah.  I'm walking to the bathroom.  God damn.  Really, I'm annoyed I've got to sit down still.  But I'm walking to the bathroom.  It's losing his mind.  What?  This is wonderful.  No.  You would never go to a lesbian bar.  This is fun stuff.  Fun stuff. 
[01:29:00]  What are you doing this weekend?  This weekend, I believe I'm going on a safari.  No, I have no idea where I'm going.  That's the beauty of it.  A lesbian bar.  It's just, you know, it's just freewheeling, my friend.  Whatever comes across my transom, I'm willing to just check it out.  I don't even know what to ask you.  Jimmy, you have anything for Anthony?  I'm trying to describe it.  It was just, you know.  We know you very well.  I mean, you barely leave your house, and now you're going to lesbian clubs. 
[01:29:30]  I'm out, not in clubs.  What did it smell like when one of them burped?  There you go.  An old tackle box.  Were they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out.  Yeah?  But a lot of, you know, up-close dancing and stuff like that.  Did it bring any of these lesbians home?  No.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared!  Jared! 
[01:30:00]  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Our Garrett is an Austin Garrett.  Anyway, Camp Nicolata, opening on Long Island soon.  Camp Nicolata.  Oh, you mean Ant's House.  You could rename it Camp Nicolata.  Camp Nicolata?  Let's go back to the Camp Nicolata story.  My neighbors.  Ante Leedy and Joni Beasley are an openly gay couple who like nothing more than to park their  RV and take in the views.  But it's not always that easy.  A lot of times, if you are in the gay community, you try to go to different campgrounds, but 
[01:30:30]  you get what I call glares and stares.  That's why the couple wanted to open Camp Nicolata, a camp that offered a safe and non-threatening  environment for homosexuals.  To lick.  I think no one would have paid any attention to this whole thing, but you had to name  it Camp Nicolata.  A lesbian camp named Camp Nicolata.  Yeah.  So people are thinking you're deranged, you're freaks.  Because it's usually younger people that go to these camps to begin with. 
[01:31:00]  This is where gay people have to relax.  You want to be taken very seriously in the communities and you want to...  Fair enough.  But then you don't name the camp you go to after what you do with your genitals.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Name it after a lake.  Yeah, because the whole thing about the gay community, they want to be taken seriously  because they don't want everything to be so sexualized, you know?  It's like, hey, we're people just like you, but we just are attracted to the same sex. 
[01:31:30]  But everything has to have this air of the sex itself, the act of sex around it, instead  of just, you know, whatever, right?  You're people, you'll just happen to like the same sex.  You don't have to flaunt it all the time like that.  How do you expect people to not laugh at you?  Like, we don't like being made fun of.  We're going to be taken seriously.  Camp Lick-a-Live.  Who wouldn't make fun of that?  I went to camp, I want to stick my c*** in a c***. 
[01:32:00]  You don't do that.  How about Camp Sorry Papa?  Camp Can't Go Home-a.  Just name it after something mundane.  Camp Ostracized-a.  Oh, there were big, big, like, gangsta bitches bouncers, too.  Black broads?  Yeah.  Black broads that were just giant. 
[01:32:30]  And you know they could kick your ass.  Trying to keep the penis out?  Any shenanigans.  No, you know, it was allowed in.  But, uh...  You had to behave?  Behave.  Were they nice to you?  Yeah, very.  Yeah, very nice.  Very cordial.  Where's this openness coming from all of a sudden with you?  With me?  You're a very closed-minded...  You have a very closed-minded soul.  It's the new Anthony.  The new Anthony.  The new Anthony.  All right.  Every so often I change.  I'm like a chameleon.  It's a safe and non-threatening environment for homosexuals. 
[01:33:00]  The two say the owners of the Golden Valley Campground property agreed to let them use a portion of their land to get started.  And we would use it for Camp Licolata to have camping, to have events, and they would get half the profits.  The other half would go to us, and then after we raised enough funds, we'd have a campground of our own.  I think the idea's fine.  Of course.  With your dumb, tongue-in-cheek name, don't expect...  Well, not in cheek. 
[01:33:30]  Well, you never know.  Well, it depends on who the clientele's going to be.  All right, well, if you want to be taken seriously, why don't you just give it a name?  Why do you have to automatically assume sexuality or sexual things when you hear the name?  How about Camp Crystal Lake?  Something just very mundane.  Yeah, exactly.  Just mundane, though.  Although Mrs. Voorhees was certainly a perfect candidate in a sweater and mullet.  And her, like, collar shirt underneath her sweater. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, is she awful?  Horrendous.  But after news of the openly gay camp spread, the co-founders say they were given an eviction notice.  It seems like if there was a misunderstanding, they would have told us prior to letting us work eight months as hard as we did.  Now, Leedy and Beasley say they are looking for a new home and dealing with threats and hatred daily.  They think the name is disgusting.  However, I think hatred is disgusting. 
[01:34:30]  As for the future of Camp Lincoln Lada?  It's worth fighting for.  It's worth fighting for anyone else that is being prosecuted.  Or persecuted.  Or judged.  Dummy.  Or hated.  That's what you get.  You name it like that and you wonder why people don't like the name.  If they just would have picked a different name, there wouldn't have been a problem like that.  Camp Lincoln Lada.  Why can't you just spread the name in the gay community, like, look, like, whatever it is, you know? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Camp.  Camp QT.  Yeah.  Camp Down Low.  Camp Stinks of Trouta.  And when you walk in the camp, there's a sign with, like, an Adam's apple with a circle with, like, a line through it.  Why would you draw attention to that?  It's a, that's like a 13-year-old boy thing to name it.  Like, a 13-year-old boy would name it Camp Lincoln Lada.  Stupid joke.  Hacky joke. 
[01:35:30]  Maybe we could try to get them on the phone.  Let's go to Bill and, uh, yeah, we're trying.  Bill in Kentucky, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, Ian, I was wondering, did they have a man in a lady's room and did the butchers use the men's room?  That's really odd.  I was by, like, one of the bathrooms at one point, but I had no clue what was walking in or out at any given moment.  So I think he just used the bathroom.  It was kind of a weird place.  Not weird, but, uh, um, the second floor in a building in some kind of a weird Brooklyn neighborhood. 
[01:36:00]  So it wasn't, uh, one of these, you know, big flashy clubs.  It was kind of cool.  You're heading into 8mm territory, I'm thinking.  You think?  Yeah, you're, go rent to 8mm.  Oh, I've seen that one.  It starts with a cute little lesbian, you know, bar in Brooklyn and ends in some dungeon in the middle of Chinatown.  Snuff films?  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to start making snuff films. 
[01:36:30]  I don't know.  That'd be fun.  A lot of people coming up with names for this camp that we just can't say on this show.  Of course.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've got the great Brian Regan.  Oh, good.  In the green room.  We love Brian.  He hasn't been on the show in a while.  We'll have him in here next, okay?  I like Brian.  Right.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial. 
[01:37:00]  Radio dial.  We've got the great Brian Regan stopping by, a really good friend of the radio show.  Yes.  And Brian sits down and goes, so how you guys been?  And we just basically said good, because we wanted to kind of save it for the air.  It's been some changes, Brian.  Oh, all right.  My pal Anthony pretty much losing his mind.  He's now single.  I don't know why I'm losing my mind.  Oh, don't look so shocked.  Oh, wow.  I'm sorry?  Oh, sorry to hear that.  Why?  Why am I sorry?  It's like a normal thing you're supposed to say after something like that, right? 
[01:37:30]  But is it?  Yeah.  Because sometimes it's like, eh, you know.  Sometimes it's like, eh, it's probably all for the best.  Well, it depends on, you know.  You expect Brian to go, well, it's about time.  On who.  Of course, Brian is.  You know, who dumps who.  Who are.  No, Brian's going to take the, I'm sorry to hear that angle.  Because that's Brian.  Oh, sorry to hear that.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Other people might be going, well, saw this coming years ago.  Patrice was like, what'd you wait for?  What, what, what, why'd you wait? 
[01:38:00]  But Anthony, you know, long-term relationship is now over.  And we find out that he was at a lesbian bar over the weekend.  Wow.  Well, you know.  Congratulations.  And.  And.  I'm now a lesbian.  And we were all, we were all like, we didn't do much with it when he just casually says  this during the last break.  Because we all know Anthony and we're like, what is going on that all of a sudden you  went from being a recluse to going to a lesbian bar?  Like, what is going on? 
[01:38:30]  And we don't know how to like handle this one.  That's what happens.  That's the normal thing I've broken up before.  You go to a lesbian bar.  Right.  That's the first thing you do.  That's the first thing you do.  Like when you get fired, you go to the corner pub and drink a little bit.  That's right.  After a breakup, you hit the local lesbian bar.  You go to the local lesbian bar.  Yeah, that's the one right down the street.  You don't want to go cross down.  You hit the local one.  You do the one around the corner.  You go to the local lesbian bar and hopefully you don't see her with her face buried in a pair 
[01:39:00]  of dungarees.  That's right next to the local Irish pub, right, Brian?  It's right there.  Yeah, that's right.  It's part of Restaurant Row.  It's just, you know, you have a little fun on the weekends.  You go out.  I think for the first time, Jimmy and I were pretty much speechless.  We're like, what?  Out with some people.  What?  Out with some people who knew some people.  A little fun on the weekends.  I've had fun on the weekends.  I didn't end up there. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Well, I played a little golf, you know, went to Hooters for a couple of pitchers.  That's my definition of fun.  Played some Scrabble.  You should play Scrabble.  I'll give, maybe I'll give that a word this weekend.  This weekend, play some Scrabble.  Some Scrabble.  You'll have just as much fun.  I need a four-letter word for lesbians.  I don't have a U.  Well, you do have a D. 
[01:40:00]  And, yeah, just, you know, it's one of those things.  I just think it's one of those things that you should just kind of experience.  Walk in, see how they are amongst their own kind of a thing.  It's like a little lesbian safari.  How about you, I don't know, start out a little slower?  How do you start out slower?  Go to an Irish pub first.  There's plenty of Irish pubs.  I've never been to a lesbian bar. 
[01:40:30]  It's kind of cool, you know?  I like this new Anthony.  Walk around.  I'll tell you, though, like I was saying, they look like guys.  It's the oddest goddamn thing.  And then they're with some that look like girls.  And then there's me, just looking around going, hey, how you doing?  I got one of these.  Were they cool?  Like, make you feel welcome and all that?  Yeah, very nice, you know.  Very welcome.  It wasn't like the bartender threw the drink at me. 
[01:41:00]  Like when you go to a birthday party and they have the big, like, the welcome thing up, like, hanging?  And did they have that up there?  Yeah, welcome, guys with penises.  Welcome, reason we're like this.  It's just, like, reassuring to them.  And that one guy in and they go, see?  I just assumed that they must have looked at me at some point and thought, because of who I was with at the time, 
[01:41:30]  they must have thought, like, wow, she really found a girl that really can look like a guy.  Grew a beard, a mustache, and everything.  Who's a scrawny broad in that hat?  Bring her over.  Bring over that scrawny broad doing impressions.  I'm a lesbian twink.  Oh, she sounds just like Tyson.  She sounds just like the guy from the Home Shopping Network.  She's really talented. 
[01:42:00]  Wow.  Yeah, very, uh...  That was fun.  There's been some changes since the last time you've been here.  Fun.  And then on Friday's show, I was doing baby diaper mustache.  So everything is a little different.  Yeah, you kind of...  Everything is quite normal on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Someone's saying, just don't order the Bloody Mary at a lesbian bar.  See, take a look at that.  That's quite normal, right?  Oh, there it is. 
[01:42:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Looks nice.  Get your hoodie on?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I went into evil mode, so I had to have a hoodie on or something.  He's got his rubber gloves on, and he has what was wrapped up in a baby diaper that he  has then smeared as a mustache.  You sure you want to still do this radio show?  Like, what?  What's going on?  I know you want to be legit.  You might want to look somewhere else, finally.  You ain't kidding.  There's been some changes.  We've kind of lost our mind. 
[01:43:00]  Check out these photos, Brian.  Damn.  I think it's gotten to the point where, like, wow, we don't really know what else to do  with this radio show, so let's start digging into diapers.  Yeah.  It was like a little tiny mustache.  You look like Schittler.  Now, I'm kind of naive.  What's the point of the mustache?  That is a very good question, Brian.  Probably the one most asked.  Like, if I was like Tim Russert, and this was a Meet the Press interview, I would go, 
[01:43:30]  what's the deal with the mustache?  Well, we were bored.  Didn't have much else to do on that show.  Well, I did it as a goof thinking that I would never have to do this, and then I got caught  with my pants down.  Because he's never supposed to leave enough time for someone to actually bring in a diaper.  So, he's supposed to get on the air and go, all right, look, it's a baby diaper day.  I'm just going to put it out there.  If you bring one up before 11, and usually this is a quarter to 11. 
[01:44:00]  You had to float those ideas a quarter up.  Yeah, but he did it an hour and a half before the show was going to be over.  The bit was that we would never do the bit, and the frustration that would build with the  listeners, because they really want to see this happen.  But these guys behind the scenes were in cahoots with each other, and they got Rich Voss,  you know Rich Voss, to come up with his baby's diaper from a couple days ago.  He actually dug into a garbage pail. 
[01:44:30]  So, hence the baby diaper mustache, which is the YouTube sensation today.  Wow.  Okay, I hope he wants to reopen the McMartin Preschool now.  Once you get a taste for blood.  You got some babies, right?  Got some babies, yeah.  Would you ever do baby diaper mustache?  I don't know that I would quite go that far.  I think I would hit the local lesbian bar.  Right.  Okay.  You got to do that first.  Just think things over.  Have some fun.  Good. 
[01:45:00]  And then when, no, I haven't gone that direction yet.  I see there's been changes with you as well, Brian.  I see you have some very nice glasses on.  Yeah.  Very, very sharp.  Very Hollywood-ish.  Very, what?  Stylish.  Yeah, very stylish.  Very fancy schmancy.  Very European-ish.  Very, uh.  That's the brand name is Fancy Schmancy.  Fancy Schmancy.  Big F-ass on the side.  I would, you know, it's, you're always more daring, I think, like when you're buying a 
[01:45:30]  shirt or something like that.  Aren't you like more daring when you're in the clothing store?  Yeah.  When you see something that's like a little bit like you're pushing the envelope.  A little different than you normally wear.  Yeah, and you go, yeah, you know what, I'm a cool guy, I can get away with that shirt.  Well, it's fashionable.  And then you get out in public and you're like, what the hell is the matter with me,  you know?  Well, that's the deal with these glasses.  You think you look good?  You're right.  And the first time I was in an airport and looked in a mirror in the restroom, I'm like, 
[01:46:00]  oh my God, I look like a jerk.  But I see you're still wearing that.  Then I realized, maybe I am a jerk.  That's the way they fit, you know?  I think you look stylish until you walk down the street and people yell, hey, queer, and  throw tomatoes.  The subtle hint.  Nice glasses, douche.  Someone is asking, what does Brian think of news reporters changing their accent?  Hey, that's a good question, man. 
[01:46:30]  That's part of my new accent.  Well, you know, the thing is, I grew up in Miami, where you would see that, and that  was normal to have a newscaster who had a Spanish accent down there.  Sure.  But what I didn't understand is when I first went out on the road, and you'd be like in  Ohio, you know, and the newscaster's obviously from the Midwest, and he still throws the Spanish  accent, and I never got that, you know?  Well, apparently this just in, some fighting has broken out down in Nicaragua.  You know, all of a sudden he's Julio Iglesias. 
[01:47:00]  We'll be sending a reporter down to Managua, Nicaragua.  Okay.  Aren't you the frequent flyer?  Racking up the miles.  But you know what I don't get is, like, that's politically correct to do that with Spanish.  You know, anybody can have a Spanish accent for one word.  You can't do that with the Asian stories, you know?  Well, the U.S. diplomat is being sent to Beijing! 
[01:47:30]  That might affect the situation in Hong Kong!  It's Beijing and Hong Kong!  Hey, honey, come watch this guy.  He's about to lose his job.  Come hither into the viewing quarters.  You're never going to see this guy again.  Yeah, he's done.  He's over now.  Never again with this man.  Why, though? 
[01:48:00]  Why Spanish and not, you know, I don't...  Yeah, that's not fair.  I've never even thought of that.  Yeah, exaggerate.  That you can do that with.  That's right.  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  Yeah, that's okay.  That's okay.  Spanglish.  Let's say hi to Colin in Florida.  Colin, what's up?  We're talking to Brian Regan.  Hey, I actually got started on O&A on Napster and have Brian's first appearance.  It's classic.  It's a bunch of people calling and complaining, where is the music? 
[01:48:30]  Why are people talking?  Where are the previous hosts?  That was the famous, this is not what I'm used to.  Yeah, this is not what I'm used to.  That was a lot of fun, man.  They were used to a lot of old rock and roll songs that we came in to mess everything up.  You can't change anything.  No.  You can't change anything.  You can have, like, the biggest piece of garbage artwork up on a wall and take it down and put up a Mona Lisa, and people are going to complain. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Because it's different.  That's not what I saw yesterday.  This is not like yesterday.  I don't want today.  I want yesterday.  Because yesterday I know, and today is new.  That's the way people are.  It's scary.  Don't switch anything up, man.  Look how well we handled the metric system.  Yeah, that worked out well. 
[01:49:30]  We tried for a moment or two.  Scared the daylights out of everybody, man.  Yeah.  No one wanted that.  But they really poured it on in school, too, like that.  This is coming.  There's no stopping it.  So start learning it.  We only have five years.  Yeah.  And everything is going to switch over.  And you're not going to know how much milk to buy.  Oh, man.  They were scared.  You know what I think they should have done?  Because they gave it, what, five years?  Yeah.  Or something like that.  They should have given it one day. 
[01:50:00]  I swear.  Just change all the signs.  Take down the miles.  Put up kilometers.  By the end of the day, you know what that means.  You better, yeah.  You know, you go, 240 kilometers.  I don't know.  What does that mean?  And then you drive it.  You go, okay, that's what that means.  Yeah.  Now I know.  You don't do five years.  Too lazy.  Because that gave people, after five years, going, I don't want to change.  Yeah.  I don't want to change.  Or you wait until five years is just about up, and then finally.  And start cramming, cramming to that metric.  We're all about cramming. 
[01:50:30]  So you're right.  Just throw it upon us.  Just change it.  Sure.  It's different now.  Just wake up, and that's the first news report that morning.  You know that system you're used to?  We ain't doing that no more.  Get used to it.  Let's say hi to Glenn in Jersey.  Glenn, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  I've listened to you guys since any W.  Brian Regan is the only comedian or guest who comes in.  And you guys and the fans have to set up bits for him.  It's the funniest freaking thing.  Well, that just started out as a joke back in the day. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  People feel compelled to do that.  And they decide never to drop it.  Yeah.  Because we would try to set up Brian and make it sound like we're being natural.  So, Brian, did you have Pop-Tarts this morning?  Yeah.  Oh, and my stuff is so bizarre that how would you naturally ask any question that has to  do with anything I talk about?  Right.  Yeah.  When you're delayed on the runway, do you ever think it's because they're in the cockpit  divvying up?  Brian, have you ever noticed anything weird in the Fig Newton's section of the supermarket? 
[01:51:30]  You know, because of you, I look at labels now.  And, you know, like what did you say?  Like a serving size is two cookies is one of the famous lines.  So, I look at stuff now and for fat content, like, oh, good news, only 120 calories.  What?  But that's only nine almonds, almonds or whatever?  They screw with that.  Whatever.  I'm trying to do nothing here.  Let's say hi to Joe in Brooklyn. 
[01:52:00]  Joe, what's up?  Well, you gave a little health break.  That was nice.  Now we know more about almonds.  Well, that's good.  I didn't notice serving sizes before I went and saw you, see?  So, besides laughing, I was very educated on what an actual serving size is.  Thank you.  It is, yes.  Wow.  Can I say my favorite part of the Pop-Tart bit is how do I get this goodness in me?  Such a great line, man.  Let's go to Joe in Brooklyn.  Joe, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up, Danny? 
[01:52:30]  Good evening.  Brian Regan, bro.  You are the funniest guy ever.  Thank you, man.  Wow, look at that.  I've been listening to you since WNEW, and you are the best.  You are very kind, man.  Thank you.  And I just got to say, what about that jerk off in Cleveland?  Maxwell, yes.  Oh, Maxwell, yeah.  Nah, funny.  Nah, funny.  Another radio war going on, apparently.  We like a good radio war, Brian.  You know how those are, Brian, constantly in battle. 
[01:53:00]  You're always feuding, man.  Always loving some shells in.  The Hatfields and McCoys here.  Why don't you comedians have wars with each other?  Why don't you take on a comedian and go at them?  Because we've got to end up working together.  They're not going to throw you in the same studio with these guys.  We've got to show up and be on the same bill, and you don't want to be on record having said something.  All of a sudden, backstage, you're like, awkward.  Said some bad things about you.  Start throwing fists. 
[01:53:30]  We've got Brian in studio.  We've got to take a break here.  So, Brian, a lot of tour dates in front of me.  I don't even know where to begin.  Should we just plug a website that has all your dates?  There you go.  BrianRegan.com?  Perfect.  R-E-G-A-N is how he spells Regan.  I know the next show will be, what, Thursday in Concord, New Hampshire at the Capital Center for the Arts.  You're doing mostly theaters now, right?  Yeah, I've been just doing the one-night things.  Last time I saw Brian, he had an amazing tour bus that I was not invited on to take a look at. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, wow.  What happened there?  Why?  Maybe it's because of your penchant for diapers.  I didn't realize you wanted to check it out.  I didn't know you were in a tour bus.  Ah, well, you know.  That was very impressive.  Brand new tour bus for Brian Regan.  And they come with the drugs and the broads.  Do they?  Yeah.  I wonder how they got them.  They have, yeah.  You don't have to pick them up at the venue.  No, the drugs and the broads.  See, that takes away from the myth. 
[01:54:30]  I always thought you had to work something.  No, no, no.  What would Brian Regan do on a tour bus, though?  Vanilla wafers and chocolate milkers.  Yeah.  And naps.  And a nice Disney film.  Yeah, fun books.  I'm going to get a little wild.  I'm going to watch in the back.  I'm going to watch a Disney film in my boxes.  What are you guys talking about?  We got Etch-a-Sketches.  We got Slinkies.  None of that lame stuff.  Six-pack of Near Beer.  Yeah.  In case the chicks get on.  That's right, man.  We got wine coolers. 
[01:55:00]  Come on.  It's probably a filth bag bus.  It probably has cuffs.  Spiked alcohol roofies.  Yeah.  I know.  Brian gets done with his act.  Everybody.  People of all ages.  Races.  Sexual orientation.  Leaving the show with smiles on their faces because Brian was so funny.  And then Brian gets back in the bus and just like,  All right, where are the bitches?  Where are the bitches?  I want to torture some bitches.  Well, the show's over at that point.  That was Brian time. 
[01:55:30]  Brian time.  I see in his bedroom.  He's got condoms and a mallet.  Where's the hardware store?  I need more duct tape.  I figure out the mallet part.  In case she gets lippy.  Yeah, you're pro-care.  Where can I get chloroform in Cleveland?  I need a hanky and some staples.  I love radio. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, well, some people think, you know, you can't possibly be like you are on stage all  the time.  Yeah.  That would be hard.  Even though there has been a noticeable change, which on anyone else you wouldn't even notice.  But with you, I'd almost call it bitter.  This bitterness on stage.  Your act's a little more angry.  Yeah, well, you know, I like to play around with different things up there.  You know what I mean?  I don't want to just be the doofus all the time.  You'll talk about certain people. 
[01:56:30]  Like, I love when you talk about going to the butterfly pavilion.  And I believe in your act you're a little mean to the person that runs the butterfly pavilion.  I think that's mean-spirited.  Wait, what's coming from you?  What's that all about?  Well, my attitude is hell with him.  Yeah.  And his butterflies.  And his stupid butterflies.  Well, they ask you, you know, when you walk in, you walk in with your kids, and you're  in, like, happy family mode, and the guy's like, you know, if you have any butterfly questions, 
[01:57:00]  I'll be happy to answer them.  And you got your kids, so they're expecting you to ask questions, so you got to brainstorm  them, and it ain't fun.  The guy's hovering around behind you, you're like, um, does this one like to eat?  He does.  Okay.  Do you ever take a break?  No, you don't.  Okay.  I was thinking, though, could there be a better job than working in a butterfly pavilion? 
[01:57:30]  You know, what could possibly go awry?  So how was work there?  Don't even get me started.  I've had it up to here with those butterflies.  I had this yellow one landing lightly on flowers.  And this purple one fluttering around and around, like I don't know what he's up to.  I can't take the politics.  Hey, we got a question before we go to break. 
[01:58:00]  We're late for a break, but Chuck's standing by here from Westchester.  We're talking to Brian Regan.  What do you got, Chuck?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Regan, I love you.  Thanks, man.  I just wanted to know if you remember the most uncomfortable thing I've ever heard.  It was you, Joey Ramone, and the two Dominics tries.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, that was wild.  Was that your most uncomfortable moment on the O.P. and Anthony show?  There have been a few. 
[01:58:30]  There have been a few.  There have been a few.  There have been a few.  Tied.  That was up there.  That was in the top 20.  Brian's been there for some weird stuff, man.  That was one of the top 20 uncomfortable moments on the O.N.A. show.  That's why I think there's something in that brain of his, because I'm like, there's no  way he's ever going to come back on our show, and he's been back time and time again.  Ah, man.  I love being on this show, man.  I appreciate you guys having me.  A lot of tour dates.  I mean, pretty much every day, Brian's going to be somewhere. 
[01:59:00]  So go to BrianRegan.com, R-E-G-A-N, and we're going to take a break, and we're going  to do a speed round with Brian, 877-212-O-N-A, and, you know, just say hi.  You don't have to set him up or anything.  That'd be crazy.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Brian Regan in studio, playing theaters all over the country.  I don't even know where to begin, because we're hurting all these cities there, Brian.  So I'm going to tell people to go to BrianRegan.com, R-E-G-A-N.  Brian is pretty much the funniest guy in America, just amazing. 
[01:59:30]  He's going to be at the Capital Center for the Arts in Concord, New Hampshire, this Thursday  night.  That's the next date for you, all right?  Perfect.  Does that work for you?  Yep.  Great.  And Brian's taping David Letterman tonight.  Showing Friday.  To air Friday.  He'll be on Letterman on Friday.  Yeah, I should have just said you'll be on Letterman Friday.  They wouldn't have known the difference.  Except for that studio audience tonight going, wait, they said Friday, and he's here.  And then we had to kind of like brag to Brian, like, you know, we were on Letterman  too once. 
[02:00:00]  That's really cool, man.  Brian's doing his 19th appearance, by the way.  19th appearance.  We got our one and done.  Yeah.  So between you guys, when you went out, who got to sit closer to the desk?  Or did you even, did you play in it?  Oh, it's a big controversy with that one.  Was it like musical chairs?  Yes.  First guy there?  It was a foot race from the wings into the chair.  You just hauled out.  Well, Letterman's very intimidating, so I was very happy to not have to sit right next to 
[02:00:30]  Letterman.  See, you got to go with the camera too.  As you're looking at the TV, it's got to look like Opie and Anthony.  See, if Anthony is sitting there, so then Opie sits on the couch part and Anthony, I got  the chair next to there because it just worked out that way.  And apparently, I didn't shut up.  I just kept talking and talking and talking.  Anthony gets a little chatty at times.  I got a little chatty.  When Anthony gets nervous, he gets a little chatty.  I get a little chatty. 
[02:01:00]  He's a fanboy too because we get some of the guys from Lost on and Anthony gets chatty and  forgets that he's doing a radio show with other people.  I like the show Lost, so I get a little chatty.  And I figured if you're on Dave, you're on Letterman or Leno, whichever one, you want  to keep talking.  You want to keep the conversation rolling.  You don't want dead spots.  Well, they don't mind dead spots because that means they get to talk.  They have commercials they need to do, I think, right? 
[02:01:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'd talk right through those too to keep the energy up.  They just kind of fade out.  Yeah, yeah, and I'm still talking.  And they come back and you're still in the middle of your...  I'm just talking, yeah.  I like when they come back and you're talking to Dave.  And then you go, and he goes, oh, we're back.  And I kind of chuckled like we were talking.  Meanwhile, he was like, could you shut up for a second?  We're catching Brian up on everything.  I was telling Brian I got engaged.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  He's going to me.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  And then looks at Anthony and...  Hey, sorry.  And sorry for what he's saying.  He's going through.  How weird it is, you know, two guys sitting right next to each other and one...  Hey, fantastic.  And you, wow.  Gee.  Sorry.  But I bet you're happy for Opie.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  I think you're...  Are you happy for me?  I never asked you officially.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm just not into the institution that is marriage. 
[02:02:30]  Anthony doesn't want to be married, doesn't want to have kids.  I absolutely am happy and wish you all the best.  Look at Brian.  He's happily married.  He's got a few kids, too, I believe.  It's because he's two.  Two kids?  He's never home.  He's never home.  I was on stage one time and there was a guy sitting up front and I don't know how I  got talking to him and I said, do you have kids?  And he goes, yeah.  And I said, how many?  He goes, five or six.  What kind of answer is that?  How can you have five or six kids? 
[02:03:00]  I got like five or six kids.  Absolutely.  You would have rounded off by six, five, whatever.  You know, somewhere in there.  I got like five or six kids.  That would be like something I would think you would know.  Like you would nail that.  Yeah.  That's one of those things you should absolutely know exactly.  Absolutely know.  You don't, you might not know, you know, how many, I don't know, something else you might  have. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, something else.  This isn't a bit, obviously, because if it was a bit, I would have a word instead of  the something else part.  Yeah, not well honed.  You really tricked us.  How many things.  Brian really tricked us there.  I really thought he was just saying it into a bit.  It was just knowledge.  It was just banter.  A thing that happened.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Sean in Jersey.  Sean, what's going on?  Sean?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Dude, Brian, you are crazy. 
[02:04:00]  I've seen you for a while.  I don't even know how many years.  Like on Comedy Central?  Yeah?  Yeah, dude.  All right.  Thank you.  You make me die laughing every time.  I appreciate that.  You're welcome.  And with the beauty of Brian Regan, too, I've seen Brian probably a dozen times easily,  and every time, just about, I don't know, 75% of the act easily is different.  Easily.  Always coming up with new stuff.  I have a bad memory.  I can't remember anything from night to night. 
[02:04:30]  That was a very nice compliment, but it's like weird in comedy.  Only in comedy can somebody call you crazy, and it's like, it makes you feel good.  It's like no other field.  Man, you are like, you're nuts.  You're like completely out of your mind.  Yeah, well, thank you.  I do surgery over at the, you're like, you're like, like a crazy lunatic surgeon.  You're like nuts.  Wow.  I appreciate that.  And then the other 25% is stuff that people want to hear so badly that they shout it out. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Well, don't want that.  You know, they do show up for it, though.  I go out front before the shows, and I hand out slips of paper.  You yell this.  You yell this one.  You yell this after he yells that, because this one segues from the other one.  Now, look, now, look, I'm really going to, I'm probably going to treat you a little harsh.  I'm going to yell at you, and you may even be thrown out, but it's for the greater good 
[02:05:30]  of Brian Regan.  It's for the good of the whole show.  You see my glasses and how cool I look, right?  Well.  How old's your oldest?  Just turned nine.  Wow.  Does he realize how funny his dad is?  You know, it's weird, because I never, I never, like, push what I do on my kids, you  know?  But, you know, he knows I'm a comedian, but now he's starting to get more curious about 
[02:06:00]  it, and he'll ask me, like, when I'm putting him to bed, you know, if I'll do, like, a bit  from my act or something.  Man, talk about nervous.  I swear to God, I'm more nervous doing a bit for my son, because it's like, I don't care  if, you know, a thousand people, like, don't like a joke, but if my boy doesn't like it,  you know?  Yeah.  And he's like, you know, so I'll, like, do a little bit, and my heart's pounding, you  know?  And he'll go, oh, that's funny, Daddy.  Oh, thank God.  Instead of just going, boo! 
[02:06:30]  Boo!  Yeah.  You suck!  Get out of my bedroom!  It's just heckling.  You bore me, Father.  He rolls over, you hack.  Right.  Bring on the dick!  That would be the harshest thing.  Ever.  If your kid called you a hack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's going to be like a nightmare I'm going to have one night.  Great joke, Dad, in 1988.  What, is there a brick wall behind you?  All right, easy, you're nine.  How do you know this? 
[02:07:00]  Right.  His iPod's full of other comedians.  Rich Boston's God is his website.  He Googles anybody but my dad.  Hey, Mom, bring on the next guy!  Let's say hi to Kristen in Boston, listening on BCN.  Kristen, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Wow, I didn't expect to be so nervous.  Ooh.  Oh.  Hey.  I wanted to say, I want to say hey to all of you guys, but my kids totally love Brian  Regan.  We went and saw him last summer, and he's hysterical. 
[02:07:30]  Thank you.  We walk around the house.  Everybody makes jokes about you all the time.  We're always saying, like, you know.  They make jokes about you.  I'm not about you, but, you know.  No, I took it an okay way.  Thank you.  That's very, very nice of you, and your family.  Thank your family.  I will.  I'll thank my whole family.  All right.  And Jimmy, too.  We love Jimmy, too.  Thank you, madam.  I hope the kids don't listen to Jimmy.  No, my kids do not listen to Jimmy.  Ooh.  But they would love him if they did. 
[02:08:00]  But no, thanks to you and your dumb children.  That was Norton.  Oh, Chris in Cleveland.  What's up, Chris?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Chris.  Hope and Jimmy.  Love you, guys.  Thanks, Chris.  He's not as nervous as the last call.  No, he's not.  He's cool.  I'm doing all right.  Hey, Brian, a quick question.  You got your new eyeglasses.  How was the trip to the eye doctor?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's a little long.  Yeah, that's a six-minute answer you're looking for. 
[02:08:30]  How about something quick?  I'll answer it this way.  It was good.  Right.  Brian, do you have a quick one, maybe?  Well, the test where they do the...  Not even on being at the eye doctor.  You don't have to be polite to that, guys.  Screw him.  Why not?  He's a good man, you know?  He's a good man.  He's probably chopping up a hooker right now.  Yeah.  I just want to listen to Brian.  How can I tell from a 30-second question? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, that could be the worst guy.  I can tell he's a good man with some...  Yeah, really, Brian.  He's a man of character.  Let's look at his resume first before you decide that.  Brian could be the worst guy ever.  Maybe he's a serial killer.  The charity work that that man does.  Maybe that's the only way he could get it, you know, get, you know what, for...  Whatever.  You can't say it over here.  I see the visuals, though.  Yeah, I don't know.  They were nice, right?  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  Well, there's no smooth way to get into it, so I won't even try. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Well, the test where they want you to tell if the one point is over the other point, you  know, where you go in there and it's like, tell me the exact moment point A is directly  over point B.  And you're like, oh, oh, oh, now, no, no, no, now, now, then.  I don't know.  I don't know when it happened.  I'm worried if I'm off by an eighth of a second, I'll get these big, giant Hubble coming attraction 
[02:10:00]  glasses.  Boy, you must have messed up the A-B test, did I ever?  Hence the corrective spectacles.  Oh, yeah, this is a good idea.  Dan Boston.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, Brian Regan and I keep getting calls about kids liking it, and maybe you should open for  Hannah Montana. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, that's a hard ticket to get, man.  I wouldn't mock that, man.  She's going to be a billionaire in the next year or two.  That's exactly why you should mock her, because we're jealous of me, Hannah.  Yeah, yeah, more.  She's kind of hot, too.  Huh?  She's kind of hot, too.  Yeah.  Hey, we're not allowed to think that.  How old is she?  She's too young to be thinking that kind of thing.  She doesn't look 15, like she's kind of a bigger girl.  She looks like she's like 15 and a half, man.  Yeah, at least.  That's what I was saying.  She's 15 and a half.  What, were you at FH Riley's this Saturday night? 
[02:11:00]  Jesus.  Hi, I'm Chris Hanson with Dateline NBC.  Oh, it's so inside just to get a reaction from someone.  I went way inside on that one.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey, Brian, I saw you over at Westbury.  You did this joke about having the name of each book on each page.  It was the funniest thing I've ever heard. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, thanks, man.  It's the, you know, I'm trying to learn how to read more or better.  More better.  Just say more better.  More better.  Trying to learn how to read more better.  Trying to learn how to read more better.  Because, you know, reading has a good reputation.  But I don't get, when you're reading a book, why they have to put the title of the book on the top of every single page.  I don't get that.  Is anybody ever, like, reading a book and then halfway through going, what the hell am I reading? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, it's right there at the top.  Okay.  Well, I forget again.  Whoa, it's right there.  Whoa, that is handy.  That's good.  That's good.  I didn't want to have to go all the way back to the cover.  Why?  Why when you're reading a book, you know?  I mean, when you go to the movies, they don't put the title on the top of the screen.  What?  Oh, okay.  Hey.  Planet of the Apes.  Okay.  I was seeing all these apes, and I'm thinking, what is going on? 
[02:12:30]  It's a planet of them.  Okay.  If the whole planet is of them, that explains these apes.  Very true.  Very true.  It's true.  It's true.  That's handy.  I know.  That's a funny thing to say.  All right.  That's our album music.  Brian Regan on tour all over the place, man. 
[02:13:00]  Theaters all over America.  Concord, New Hampshire on Thursday night at the Capital Center for the Arts.  You can get all of Brian Regan's tour dates at BrianRegan.com.  You spell Regan, R-E-G-A-N, and Letterman on Friday.  That's very cool, Brian.  Thank you, guys.  Well, we're off to the other place, right?  Yep.  Over to Bad Languageville, as I like to call it.  This Friday, I'll be in the Gothic Theater in Denver, and Saturday is like the Pangeus  or something in Minneapolis. 
[02:13:30]  There's like less than 30 tickets left at the Minneapolis one.  So, very, very cool.  All right.  We're off to the other place.  You guys have a good day.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's M202.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office. 
[02:14:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:14:30]  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony. aineеры.  There was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us  and then let him starve.  And then let him starve.  Great.  Kind of like what we're doing for the listeners.  And starving them of entertainment.  They are sick.  Free.  Bobby, please, look.  There's one part we want you to see.  That's easy.  Oh, you okay?  This is where entertainment is going. 
[02:15:00]  These guys are watching porn.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you talking about?  Oh, my God.  We're done.  We're out.  What is this?  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And here we are at XM Satellite Radio.  Easy as that.  I think we strong-armed Brian and told him, get your ass over to XM.  I felt guilty because I know what Brian's all about.  He's just over-the-top nice. 
[02:15:30]  Can't say no to anything.  So I go, Brian, we're going over to XM.  You want to join us?  Well, I got it.  All right.  Okay.  He's got wardrobe.  He's obviously very busy, but he can't say no to anyone.  Happy to be here, man.  When was the last time you told someone, no, go fuck yourself?  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  That's right.  You can curse on this one.  That's a different tone.  It certainly is. 
[02:16:00]  And then we'll walk it over here, right?  And we got fans that stand outside every day waiting for the walkover so they can come  up and check out the XM portion, even though we told people to just get them upstairs.  But maybe that'll take it.  Where's the guy and the girl that were outside?  They should have been sitting already.  Where are they?  We set that plan in motion weeks ago, but they still have to stand out in the cold and wait.  I don't know.  50 times we said we don't want the listeners to have to stand out in the cold.  It's fucking freezing outside.  Makes no sense.  Yeah.  But anyway, so we're walking. 
[02:16:30]  Should be up here.  Of course they should be.  But we're walking by the listeners that are shivering in the cold waiting for us.  Yeah.  And I go, I say hi, and I casually go, this is Brian Regan.  And next thing you know, I just keep walking, because you do the quick hi and you keep  walking, right, toward XM.  All of a sudden I turn around and everybody's standing there awkwardly like, hey, I-  Talking and freezing.  Talking and making sure it gives them the proper amount of time, I guess, whatever goes through  your head.  Where are you guys from?  And all of a sudden I yell, Brian! 
[02:17:00]  Come on, Eddie.  Are you guys liking it here in New York City?  Yeah.  You've got to be sociable.  I've been through your town.  Right.  Talk about some lore.  About their town.  What do you guys do when you're at a party and you need to walk away from somebody?  Just walk away.  Yeah.  Do you have some kind of maneuver?  I have to shit.  I just say that.  Ah.  That'll work.  That works?  It sure does.  Truth of the matter is.  Wow.  I do have a move.  I do like a...  Now everybody's going to know. 
[02:17:30]  Maybe we shouldn't say.  Because then they're going to know you're doing it to them.  And then they should know, because they should know not to monopolize my time.  Yeah.  To the point where I have to go.  I look over their shoulder a little.  And I do like a one second with my finger thing.  Like one second.  And I'll even mouth sometimes.  One second.  And I go, dude, I got to go.  I got somebody over here I got to talk to.  So you look over their shoulder.  I look over their shoulder.  Somebody's calling you.  Yeah.  And go like, one second.  And then they look behind and realize that it's just you two out in the woods.  Yeah.  That's... 
[02:18:00]  I saw an owl.  I'll be there in a second.  That I wanted to talk to.  He was asking me who somebody was.  They're always asking questions.  Those owls.  Who are you talking to?  Jimmy, what's wrong?  Oh, no.  Well, now there's a problem.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  Why are you staring at your Metamucil?  I asked him for psyllium husk.  Orange flavor.  That's what Steve said.  He said it was basically that.  It's basically Metamucil, but it's not.  All right.  Well, maybe...  I like a steak.  Give him a pork chop.  It's meat.  Here, do this.  Go sell that to Steve. 
[02:18:30]  Steve, he just bought some Metamucil.  Oh, God damn.  No, just give me some, please.  If they have psyllium husk...  Leave it here.  It's like fish food.  If they have psyllium husk orange, I would like that if they don't take this.  But that stuff works.  I know, but I think psyllium husk is better, and the orange is a little bit better.  And you do Metamucil?  Are you up to that?  No, I don't know.  Why?  I don't...  I don't know.  Do you have good poopies?  I believe so.  All right.  Then you don't know what Metamucil is, then.  You don't need it.  I'm not quite there yet, but...  Yeah, when you feel a little clogged up, you do a little Metamucil, and it flows nicely. 
[02:19:00]  My shits are ungodly.  By the way, also another great one at the party.  Just to say it as a statement.  If you don't want to look like you're walking away, you just say that, like, my shits are  out of this world.  Another one I've used, which is always helpful, is...  I'll be right back.  I have to sprinkle a little anthrax in the vents.  Wow.  This one works really well.  Hold your cocktail, just stare off into space and go, fucking juice. 
[02:19:30]  Wow.  I bet all of those work great.  Those probably all get the people.  I think Brian was going somewhere with this.  No, no, no, I wasn't at all.  I'm just curious, because, you know, after shows, it gets weird when you have, like, a  number of people that don't know each other, and you need to move on from one group to  the next, and I'm going to start using those.  It is tough.  This one works, too.  I'm bored, and just walk away.  Look, I think I gave you the proper time.  That's what you probably should tell them.  Yeah, I gave you enough time. 
[02:20:00]  I know you won this from a radio station promotion, but look, I'm a big star, and I got things  to do.  Well, no, I mean, you do want to talk to people, but it's like they don't realize there's other  people.  What do you do when you get the two people come up to you at the same time and start talking?  They don't know each other.  It's two completely different conversations, and they're both talking to you, and you don't  know who to pick, or sometimes you're talking to somebody, and another person will walk  over and just start talking right over them, and you got to say, oh, ah, wait, wait a minute. 
[02:20:30]  That happens all the time, like the big rude boar just muscles his way in to some other kind  of, you know, other, yeah, it's very strange.  Here's how you make the determination.  Which everyone has tits.  That's the one you talk to.  That's the one you talk to, and you act like the fucking, the loud thing next to her isn't  existing, and they'll eventually walk away.  You act like he's a fucking siren in the distance.  Whatever has tits you talk to, it's a bumper sticker.  Bank on it. 
[02:21:00]  You should have like a social class, you know?  Yeah.  You teach social skills.  You really, exactly.  Jim Norton's social skills.  Got a clit?  Feel free to say hi.  If you don't, just fucking wave on your way out and buy something.  Oh, man.  Hey, let's say hi to Ray.  Buy a DVD and fucking hit a guardrail.  Let's say hi to Ray in Pennsylvania.  Ray.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up, Ray?  You hear me? 
[02:21:30]  I love Jimmy.  Thank you.  No, no.  Thank you.  I'm a big fan of yours, man.  You probably heard this a thousand times, but where did you get yourself from?  Are you a writer?  Just hang up.  Just hang up.  Where does the employees?  Right now.  Hang up.  All right.  I'm kidding, man.  Brian might want to answer that.  I thought that was to you.  No, it was to Brian.  He just, where do you get your material from?  Where do you get me your material from?  It's so wacky.  Don't you love that question? 
[02:22:00]  Kmart.  There's an aisle.  There's an aisle at Kmart.  Everyone keeps missing it.  It's just comics.  Hey, we got a soldier outside today.  Soldier?  I was hanging out with him yesterday.  I always call him a soldier.  F.H. Riley, my brother's joint in Huntington, 400 New York Avenue.  Cool.  And George.  Fucking.  What?  What is he?  He's coming in.  He's coming in.  He's coming in.  He's coming in.  Taxi.  He's going to try to recruit us.  All right.  George, sit down for a minute here.  Damn. 
[02:22:30]  He's a huge fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  What, George?  He, uh.  Navy, sir?  Yes, sir.  He just got back from Iraq literally, what, Friday?  Um, Saturday morning.  Saturday morning.  Wow.  And then he decided that he needed to go to F.H. Riley's.  Who didn't?  You got back from Iraq Saturday.  You were in Huntington by Saturday night.  Uh, yeah.  I arrived on the train Sunday morning in Huntington.  Oh, Sunday.  Okay.  Yeah.  A train from Iraq?  Well, we are making progress.  That's good.  Wow.  Now, I took a city hop to LaGuardia and then the Penn Station and then to Long Island. 
[02:23:00]  What rank are you, sir?  Uh, Command Master Chief.  What's that?  I'm more familiar with Army terms.  Uh, E-9.  Oh, okay.  Sergeant Major.  That's who my dad was, yeah, in the Army.  All I know, he's got about 57 stripes on that jacket, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of stripes on there.  That's very impressive.  Yeah.  Been in a while, huh?  Uh, this is, uh, 28 years.  28 years.  Wow.  Yeah.  So you're an enlisted man.  Yes, sir.  He's a lifer, though.  That's great.  He's going to retire in another year or so.  And, uh, got a little bit of color up there on the chest. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, a little bit of confetti.  That's nice.  How annoying is it that someone goes to college and they come out an officer and they're like  28, 29 years old and they think they know what they're doing and you have to, do you  have to tolerate them?  Um, no.  Um, my position is that I'm kind of the liaison between the officers and the enlisted men  in the sense that even the ensigns and, and lieutenants will ask me what to do first  before they'll even bark out an order.  Oh, good.  Man.  But, Rose, at most, respect for your, uh, authority. 
[02:24:00]  I'm telling you.  For your experience.  I've been around the block and they know that.  Right when we saw them outside, it was like, you know, you just get this instant, like,  aura of respect.  Like, oh my gosh, we're around a hero.  Kind of like, has to earn that.  Can't just be some officer coming to, all, all snot nose coming out of West Point or something.  Or wherever they come out of for the Navy.  Where do they come out of for the Navy?  Annapolis.  Annapolis.  That's the place.  Why wouldn't you know that, you fucking queer?  I don't know.  It's too busy in lesbian bars.  He usually knows everything. 
[02:24:30]  I remember.  I know.  But don't they come out of Fire Island?  No, you fucking marry.  They don't.  I know, Annapolis.  I just, it slipped my mind, dammit.  A lot of your mind has slipped.  Hey.  Hanging out in lesbian bars.  What is going on with Anthony lately?  So, what's the Navy, what's the basic job over there for the Navy?  There's varied jobs, though, depending on your rate and what unit you're with.  You could be coastal, patrolling waterways, tires and freighties. 
[02:25:00]  If you are in special warfare operations, that would be specifically SEALs and boat teams.  Right.  You'd be ground troops.  Yeah, SEALs.  If I went to go try out as a Navy SEAL, how long would it take before they kick me out  of the program?  I guess that would depend on how long you train prior to getting there.  It's never.  In other words, you're not even in shape to get in. 
[02:25:30]  Train before you get there.  You could, like, muscle your way into the first day and just get the visual of the guy  looking at you.  Yeah.  What are you doing here?  How do you know that Brian's not in shape for the Navy SEALs?  It's not too hard to take a gander to realize I'm not Navy SEAL material.  G.I. Jane.  You know, the Navy SEALs will have you sit there, right, in the cold.  Those fuckers, man, you get your uniform all wet. 
[02:26:00]  You just have to sit there and shiver, which I wouldn't like.  I'd probably request a change of uniform.  That's called making you a sugar cookie.  Get you all wet and roll you in the sand and let you sit there.  Sugar cookie.  How long do they sit for?  That's ten minutes?  Hours sometimes.  You wear a SEAL?  Yes, sir.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  Wow, man, man.  Just looking at that.  Wow.  That's nice.  And George is a huge fan of the show, so he's on the air to rub it into his boys, because  I guess they were listening to us in the field.  You were telling me at a...  Yeah, we get the guys in my unit, wives and girlfriends, send over the flash drives with 
[02:26:30]  the show recorded on them, so you can listen to them on the laptop.  So, I've only been listening a couple of years, and the guys are huge fans, and I said,  you know what, I'm just going to come in and see if I can just get here, get a picture.  I was just going to send it over, but this is a laptop.  Oh, man, this is cool, man.  Please.  It's our honor to have you on the program.  He has a laptop in the field, and all of a sudden, if they have some downtime, they  actually say, well, you want to listen to the guys. 
[02:27:00]  Listen to the show, yeah.  Crapping little speakers, but does the job.  That's all right.  You're not missing much, believe me.  So, you were a Navy SEAL.  When did you go through SEAL training?  Did you actually go...  Were you in the field as a SEAL during the war, or were you a SEAL during...  Yeah, I went in in the summer of 79.  I went through BUDS in 1980.  My first operational mission was Grenada.  Oh, wow, okay.  As a SEAL?  Yes.  Jesus.  They don't fucking play games.  Did you want to smack those news people with their cameras? 
[02:27:30]  We were in at night, and we didn't see them, so that was the aftermath of our operation.  Yeah.  Can you hold your breath underwater pretty good?  It's a SEAL, you dummy.  Of course.  No, that's one thing I can't do at all.  It's terrible.  They teach them a dog paddle and yell, help.  That's the one ribbon they didn't give them, is the holding breath ribbon.  How long can you hold your breath?  About six minutes.  Jeez.  You can really hold your breath for six?  I was expecting like a minute. 
[02:28:00]  I am a fucking...  Jeez, I have the lungs of an 80-year-old man.  I can't get down through the pool once.  You give six minutes?  Six minutes.  Roughly.  No stress six minutes.  Wow.  Can we do it today?  Wow.  How do you...  You've got to prepare for it.  Well, if you did two minutes, I'd be impressed.  Three minutes.  How do you draw that kind of breath?  How do you...  Because I get panicky.  I'm like getting tight in the chest thinking about that.  I would not be a good SEAL.  Isn't there a...  You've got to like almost hyperventilate first.  Yeah, you've got to go through a super saturation period. 
[02:28:30]  Your blood has to be completely oxygenated, so you hyperventilate a little bit, and then you've got to relax, really relax yourself.  And generally, you're saturating with pure oxygen, not just ambient air.  Yeah.  You're only talking about 16% oxygen and ambient air, so it doesn't give you the amount of saturation in your blood cells that you need to draw from.  How do you saturate?  Do you have to breathe through a thing before you?  Yeah.  It's just like a nasal cup or a facial cup.  Wow.  It's just a little one-pound cylinder of oxygen, and that's, you know, that's for... 
[02:29:00]  That's just for testing, really.  You don't do it in practical situations, really.  Did you have a field of expertise?  Like, I know Navy SEALs are able to...  They're really good at going underwater and, like, you know, planting, you know, devices or whatever it is you need to do.  Did you have a field of expertise?  Does it work that way with you guys?  Yeah.  Combat medic.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  Very cool.  Combat medic, okay.  Oh, man.  So you're...  I love the...  What the hell was that clip I saw?  It's a new commercial for the Navy, and they show the beach, and the waves are kind of washing 
[02:29:30]  up on it, and you don't see...  Oh, and you see the footprints?  Yeah, you don't see anything, and then the waves wash back, and you just see the footprints  coming out of the water.  It's like, okay, these are some creepy bastards, man.  That's some secret insertion.  Can you swim underwater with, like, a knife in your teeth?  What the hell?  You're a...  What is he?  You're a...  Yeah, exactly.  Why would you? 
[02:30:00]  There's no reason to do that.  I hope he'd be holding his breath with a knife in his mouth and doing everything wrong.  I just picture that's what the Navy SEALs do.  His canteen strip strapped to his head.  What are you doing?  You got some face paint on, you got a knife in your teeth, and you're swimming underwater.  My leather loincloth on.  All right, so you actually saw some combat action as a medic.  Yeah.  We're divided up into our different rates.  You'll have gunners' mates, medics, machinists' mates, stuff that, you know, jobs that will 
[02:30:30]  make our team more cohesive and be able to work our way out of things.  What kind of martial arts training?  Did they give you any type of hand-to-hand?  Yeah, close quarter battle.  Okay, so you know, you're like a weapons expert or...  Mm-hmm.  Jesus.  I think I'm going to give you some wounds I could treat.  Yeah.  So were you in the first Gulf War?  Yes, I was.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Didn't last long.  No.  Not for us, anyway.  Were you on a ship or... 
[02:31:00]  No, I was operational.  Oh, you were operational.  Which meant you were in the middle of doing things.  Yeah.  You guys always go earlier, I think, too.  Like, I was talking, we were over in Iraq.  I was talking to some Green Berets, and it's like, a lot of times, I'm sure you guys  are the same.  You hit the ground a lot fucking sooner than it's even been announced that there's something  going on.  Yeah, generally, that's the case.  Take the eyes out, guys.  You know, you don't want yourself in the spotlight at that point, and the more covert or clandestine  you can be, you know, the easier it is to get your job done and get out of there. 
[02:31:30]  How do you get in?  I'm sorry.  I was just going to ask, how big a team?  That depends on the operation.  Generally, you're running with six to eight men, depending.  If it's a larger scale, obviously, there's several platoons involved.  But usually, it's waterborne delivery or fast rope insertion or halo jumps.  It's fast rope insertion.  What's that?  I'm coming off a helo and fast roping down a helo rope or a jump.  I was going to ask you, what do they call it, a high-low or something? 
[02:32:00]  Halo.  It's a high-altitude, low-opening jump.  Okay.  How high will you jump and how low will you open?  Generally, about 35,000 feet is your exit point.  That's a fucking cruising altitude of a jet.  At least it's like 2,500 feet.  You open at 2,400 feet.  Have you done this?  Yeah.  From 35,000 feet, you jumped out of a plane?  Yeah, I've got 12 halo drops.  Wow.  And then when do you pull the cord?  Again, you sail in the therms up there, so you can kind of steer.  But generally, you're opening up in and around 3,500 feet. 
[02:32:30]  That's a pretty long free fall.  So how long is that, about a minute drop?  No.  So, again, you can actually sail in the thermal layers.  What's that mean?  What's that mean?  We don't know what that means.  Layers of air, warmer and cooler.  So you get more buoyancy in different thermal levels, so you can actually steer where you need to go, and you'll stay longer.  Like Superman.  You can fly around?  Fly around.  Wow.  I mean, not to the point where I want to go there, but in a general direction, I can take.  What do you get, like a 3 to 1 ratio or something? 
[02:33:00]  Near enough, yeah.  Yeah.  What's that mean, 3 to 1?  For every 3 feet you fall, you can go 1 foot forward.  Oh, okay.  And, yeah, you can get pretty far from 35,000 feet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if you're wearing, like, a tracking suit or something?  Just a GPS on your wrist.  Yeah.  You got anything, like, to...  I know sometimes they put suits, and they have, like, almost, like, wings on them, underneath the arms.  No, you're in your drop gear, your combat gear. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you fall...  Now, how long does it take to fall 35,000 feet before you open?  Like, and how do you know it's time to open?  Like, do you have something that tells you how high up you are?  Yeah, an altimeter.  Okay.  And then you just have to do it yourself.  Yeah, a little bird comes by.  Pecks on his head.  Yeah.  Something tells you.  It's time.  And how long of a fall is that?  Well, it could be 15 minutes, or it could be 25 minutes.  Whoa.  You fall for 20 minutes?  Damn. 
[02:34:00]  Wait, what?  Yeah, it's...  That's great.  You got to remember, you know, at that height, whether you drop a paper cup or a body out  the window, it's just bouncing along the thermal ribbon.  So if I got sucked out of an airplane, I always figured I'd be dead in two minutes.  I got a 20-minute fucking...  You would be.  Well, you got to remember, we've been trained to, you know, to stay up and steer with our  hands and our feet.  So that's given us buoyancy and, you know, creating a drag on ourselves so we're not falling 
[02:34:30]  at, you know, those altitudes as fast as you would at, you know, a 10,000-foot drop.  So what do you have, like an oxygen mask?  It's freezing up there, too.  I mean, it's like minus 40.  Take a sweater.  You're going to be chilly if you're dropping 20 minutes to the atmosphere.  So do you have, like, what do you...  Yeah, you have a shawl.  In Afghanistan.  And Bola.  We have proper, you know, gear for the temperature.  Holy shit.  35,000 feet. 
[02:35:00]  That's got to be amazing.  That's pretty cool.  First time you go out at that altitude's got to just be something.  Yeah, the pucker factor goes way up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet, man.  Chaves it on itself like a fucking collapsing star.  Let's say hi to Max in good old Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Jesus, Opie, these little kid questions.  Can you hold your breath?  Can you carry a knife in your teeth?  Yeah.  Why don't you tell them about the big tough fights you had underwater with the French guy? 
[02:35:30]  Well, you know, I don't want to brag.  It's like an episode of Sea Hunt with Opie.  I also have some.  Except not hunt.  I also have some underwater experience, George.  We should have discussed this.  Underwater combat experience.  I've done a little underwater combat myself.  So me and you, I can relate to what you're saying here today.  Can you?  Absolutely.  I should have discussed this with you at FH Riley's when you were drinking your Budweiser's.  You were pretty much drowning in Budweiser's. 
[02:36:00]  They were tasty.  No, I kind of had a fight with a Frenchman underwater once.  60 feet.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's impressive, right?  Sure.  It was like slow motion fighting, but it was fighting just the same.  It's hard to have a fist fight.  How does a fight get started underwater?  Well, when you're going scuba diving.  Got a temper.  It's not like you can exchange words.  No.  Well, when you're going scuba diving and they're giving you instruction on the boat and you 
[02:36:30]  see a Frenchman not paying attention whatsoever, you might say to yourself, ah, whatever.  He's on his own.  Doesn't matter as long as he doesn't affect me.  Right, Brian?  So I jump in the water and I'm kind of like just hanging out at the bottom waiting for  everyone else to get in the water.  And I look up and I see a Frenchman that wasn't paying attention on the boat descending quite  rapidly onto my head.  It might piss you off to the point where you got to take a stab at the guy or a punch.  So I did.  You had the knife in your teeth and you took the stab at him? 
[02:37:00]  I wish I knew George because I don't know how to get my footing quite right underwater.  So when you do punch, it would be effective.  See, when I started punching, my whole body started rolling because I'm not planted.  So, you know, I've had some experience.  Cool.  I was hoping you would help me out there, but I guess.  Oh, man.  That's just amazing, man.  He's just laughing at you.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  How do you, like, what do you know, how do you eat? 
[02:37:30]  Usually with my mouth.  No, but let's say you're.  I hope it's the same method.  I teach you to pick up food with your anus and honey with your feet.  You just want to see something that you do that's like what we do, you know?  Yeah.  Matt Lamb from New York City is answering your question, Brian.  Fights get started because Opie's a jerk.  No, like, when you land on an island, like, how do you eat?  Like, I would get hungry and then I'd have to go find the boat. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, you have MREs and, you know.  What's an MRE?  Like a power bar?  Yeah.  It's like a power bar, right?  Yeah, you have all that kind of stuff.  Power bar.  You know, operationally, again, it's, you might be going in for four hours, eight hours  a day.  You eat heavily before you go and, you know, carb up and get all your proteins in order and  not to the point where you're stuffed or going to be sick, but, you know.  But eating a few berries and a couple leaves, you know, that's not going to get the job done. 
[02:38:30]  You're going to be starving out there.  Well, there's not a lot of jungle operations going on these days and, you know.  That we know of.  That's right.  Well, we're with you, George.  Ready to jump in that vent as well, I think, I bet.  Hmm?  Can I tell you what I think of an awful thing?  This is the little thing, like, shitting.  That's got to be, like, what do you do if you're in the middle of an operation, or God  forbid, a jump at 35,000 and you've got to take a dump?  I mean, I think.  Let it go.  Let it go.  At that height?  Yeah.  You know, what are you going to do? 
[02:39:00]  Pull your pants down?  Oh, in the pants you mean?  Yeah, let it go in the pants.  Have you ever done that?  Sure.  You shit your pants?  Hmm?  Really?  Not on purpose, but.  Yeah, I've had to, sure.  And then what do you do?  Just keep fighting?  Yeah, clean up later.  How do you?  It's such a weird thing to shit your pants.  I couldn't function.  I'd be too embarrassed.  Embarrassed?  This is like life and death stuff you're doing here.  I would like to fight you.  I'm just way too embarrassed.  That's what separates people like us from people like him. 
[02:39:30]  Just rolling over on my back and feeling it squish.  I would just try to tell my opponent, look, can we do this later?  Yeah.  You don't know what's happening.  And what about cranky ass?  That's got to drive you nuts.  You've got to clean up.  Yeah, you just clean up.  It's not something that you enjoy, but it's just a necessary evil.  That's fucking amazing.  You just shit your pants and keep fighting.  Those are men.  Yes.  Those are fucking men.  And by the difference between us and him, that's what I meant.  He's the man.  We are not.  And they shit their pants for different reasons, like because it's just a physical necessity. 
[02:40:00]  I would do it at the first sight of trouble.  You give away the position with your stink.  The enemies are coming.  I've had an accident.  Oh, man.  How many guys, they say Navy SEALs is, because people have this fascination with Navy SEALs.  The percentage of people that actually make it through the training are very, very minimum.  Yeah.  You can probably say, years ago it was a lot more, but now you can probably say that 75% 
[02:40:30]  of the class is eliminated throughout the process of BUDS.  Have you engaged in hand-to-hand with the enemy?  Yeah.  Have you had to just, you know, have you had to kill anybody?  I mean, that's probably a child's question, but.  He doesn't want to talk about this.  Ixnay.  Someone is asking me to ask you to see your CAC.  What is that?  They spelled it wrong. 
[02:41:00]  I forgot a letter and missed one.  What's a CAC?  The one that I gave you yesterday.  Oh, I got a CAC.  So now I'm a Navy SEAL?  No.  Yeah, sure you are.  It's that simple.  Oh, huh?  No, it's just, you know, commemorative for you.  Yeah, I got a CAC.  Really?  What does CAC stand for?  It's a challenge coin.  Yeah, I got a challenge coin now.  I'm part of the Navy SEALs.  I got one from Arlie Ermey. 
[02:41:30]  I got that.  He's a good actor.  Yeah, but that looked like something you could find from, like, a gumball machine.  The one I got looked like it's been through some stuff.  Some drinking.  It's been through some drinking.  Show that to the Frenchman when he's coming down.  I got a CAC, buddy.  He'd be like, oh.  I got a CAC here, bud.  Uh-huh.  Let's go to Joey.  It's really cool, man.  Cape Cod.  Joe?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to ask, you know, there's a lot of, you know, you guys have been talking  a little bit about, like, I heard somebody mention, I think maybe Opie, 
[02:42:00]  about, like, Army Green Berets, or no, I was Jimmy, and, like, Navy SEALs.  I just wanted to ask what he thinks is the most well-trained of all the special operations  for America.  Well, he's going to be a little biased.  I'm sure it's his training.  Here's why I asked.  I went a little bit to the H program.  It's Green Berets, like, right off the street.  I didn't make it.  It's pretty difficult.  But at the same time, you know, like, I mean, from what I heard about what they do  compared to the Navy SEALs, like, I know Navy SEALs are more like water operations and 
[02:42:30]  things like that.  And I know that, like, Green Berets kind of, like, do all of that type of thing, and I'm  just wondering, like, what his take on that is.  Essentially, you know, each unit's specific to, you know, different theaters and different  types of operations.  I don't know that I could, you know, cross-compare one group with the other because their operational  specialties are that different.  Right.  Well, fair enough.  So what do you have?  You have Navy SEALs, the Army Rangers, the Green Berets. 
[02:43:00]  Does the Air Force have a representative like that, or no?  Yeah.  PJs, power jumpers.  Okay.  And then you guys are obviously the most dangerous of all those four specialist groups.  Yeah.  You're forgetting Delta, too.  Oh, Delta.  Who's that?  That's Army.  Oh, okay.  Army.  Of those five groups, who would you say is the most, the biggest problem?  Operationally specific, we're all a big problem.  Yeah.  Yeah, it just depends on what you're doing. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, where are you?  We're coming to get you.  Let's go to Wes, the trucker.  Wes, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just want to ask them about, I guess, SEAL Team 6.  Is that true?  I mean, about how they're like a special terrorist unit?  Yeah, it's an anti-terrorism unit.  Hmm.  Can you elaborate, or just, it's like so secretive, or?  Well, Team 6 has been around out of Damnock, Virginia, for quite some time. 
[02:44:00]  They are the counter-terrorism unit, and you can basically say that the last, you know, six years or so has been a counter-terrorism type of affair.  So, yep, they're operational.  Okay, cool.  All right, man.  Well, I appreciate the call, man.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in Georgia.  Mike.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I wanted to ask him why the Navy's got some of the manliest things going on, but they've got the faggotest uniforms around. 
[02:44:30]  Jeez.  I mean, he doesn't come into the studio to ask the question.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, why don't you come down here and ask him face-to-face?  Well, so you're talking...  We're taking a call from Omaha or something, you know?  I think you're talking about, you know, the...  Yeah, the white sail uniforms.  Yeah, noobs that come in.  They don't go over...  What do you think, they fight in those?  They don't do operations in the white.  With a mop in their hand doing a dance.  Yeah.  It's not quite...  It's so funny.  George is wearing, like, a... 
[02:45:00]  What color is that?  It's a dark gray or blue?  It's technically navy dress blue, but it's black.  Yeah, it's his dress blues.  It's like any other...  I almost said officer, but he's not an officer.  Yeah, officers wear white.  Yeah, they do, right?  Of course they do.  Just a bunch of tampons.  No one cares about them.  Sissy white uniform.  Built some coffee, just beg.  That's just me, of course.  Very cool.  Well, George, you know, welcome.  Thank you very much for your time.  George, thanks for stopping in. 
[02:45:30]  Fantastic.  Thank you for everything you and you guys do.  Yep.  Appreciate it, definitely.  It's just amazing that there's people out there that are willing to do what you guys do,  because the rest of us are just a bunch of faggots.  And it really is.  You feel like it after.  I know.  It's like, how do you even talk about anything manly when a guy like this comes in?  There's no way to follow this.  Hey, I'm at Chuckles this weekend.  Hey, yeah, exactly.  What are you doing?  I'm in a dyke bar. 
[02:46:00]  It's like, you know, he's shitting his pants and fighting.  I'm putting baby shit on my face and be shocking.  Let's be real here for a second.  We don't all belong in the same room.  We are the worst.  But thanks God there are people out there willing to do that for this country.  What do you think of Iraq?  What don't we know about Iraq?  Because I'm sure the media is portraying it accurately for everybody back here in the States. 
[02:46:30]  From what I've seen, just, you know, I was on the Internet yesterday or last night, and I don't think they show the locals that are actually, you know, on board with, you know, just change.  They kind of keep that at a minimum from what I've seen so far.  It's because it doesn't make a good story.  Yeah, and I guess it doesn't support the war effort if we're, you know, really affecting change.  Well, when I was in the country, I was talking, the guys, that was the most annoying thing for them, too, is that the media never shows you the people that are really happy you're there. 
[02:47:00]  You know, people act like it was this fucking great place before.  Meanwhile, when you look at Afghanistan, like the Taliban, I mean, they're just barbarians, and they're brutalizing their own people, which I don't personally care.  I don't think we should lose one soldier for them to brutalize them.  Fuck those people.  I don't have any feelings for them at all.  But, I mean, the people act like it was this great democracy, and the awful U.S. government came in.  It's just not the way it is.  They're terrible.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  Let's go to Nick in Virginia.  Nick?  Hey, I just got a question.  What was the toughest thing a SEAL's ever gone through?  What have you ever gone through, whether it was in combat or in blood?  Oh, jeez.  I don't know.  Bloods is tough.  I mean, you're a kid, but, you know, mentally it's tough.  Physically, it's tough.  Is there one single thing during training that you all look towards going like, oh, boy, that thing? 
[02:48:00]  Um, yeah, the hell week, you know, when you're on the grinder and you're awake and, you know,  23 hours a day sometimes and you got three minutes to eat and, you know, that's...  Three minutes to eat?  Yeah, you get a couple sandwiches and you shove them down your neck and you got to go in line,  get your sandwiches and roll out again.  I can't get through a radio show if I don't get enough sleep.  Where do you shit that week?  Wherever you are.  Jimmy has all the shit questions. 
[02:48:30]  I'm telling you, what's more uncomfortable than having to do it?  It's fucking horrendous.  It's a paralyzing thing when you have to shit.  Well, I got to remember that week, too, you're burning carbs and proteins.  You don't have a lot of waste.  If you don't eat enough, you know, you'll fall out.  Your body will start feasting on itself.  So you're just using everything you put in here, yeah.  Yeah, there's not a lot of waste that week.  Okay, so you're just pissing your pants if you have to.  If you can get some water out of it, sure. 
[02:49:00]  Okay.  And what about, do they have you eating insects or certain bugs, anything like that?  No, that's seer school.  Yeah.  It's survival, evasion, rescue, and extraction.  Yeah, you get a limited amount of stuff, and, you know, you're told what you can eat and what you can't.  Kind of know what you can't eat and, yeah, shouldn't eat.  Scorpions, stay away from the tail.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Or else, you know, put them over a fire, you can eat the tail, too.  Really?  Just knock the stinger off.  Use it as a toothpick. 
[02:49:30]  Tough guy.  Have you ever fought a pirate?  No.  Not once?  Nope, not once.  Were you injured in combat at all?  Can you say, like, hand-to-hand, did you have anybody really hurt you?  I've taken one bullet in the arm.  Ow.  Let's not say that casually.  I'm just going to say, ow.  That's a fucking big deal.  You got shot in the arm.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Which arm?  Ow.  Just right forearm.  Now, is it something that incapacitated you at all in the long run, or are you, like,  perfect mobility?  No, I'm fine.  What was it?  AK.  AK?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  God, all those savages.  What kind of mark does that leave?  That's a pretty big round.  What is that?  Wow.  It's not that bad, though, because the scar...  It's plastic.  Oh, wow, right through the bump.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It's plastic?  No, plastic surgery.  Oh.  I was like, what?  You got a plastic arm?  You break a bone on that one, too?  Yeah, the ulnar.  What'd you do when that happened?  Did you continue fighting?  Were you able to pull back?  No, I hunkered down, and I...  I said, ow. 
[02:50:30]  It tore the radial artery, so I had to get a tourniquet and get medevaced out.  That's a good thing.  At least, though, you're a medic, though.  You kind of knew how to take care of it real quick.  Mm-hmm.  Damn.  Oh, well, I hope some big planes came in and took care of that guy.  All right, we know where they are.  Let's say hi to Ronnie in Ohio.  Ronnie.  Hi.  How are you guys doing today?  Hey.  O-way and O-J.  Hey.  How far down have you ever gone diving before? 
[02:51:00]  Oh, depth-wise?  Mm-hmm.  Um, about 240 feet.  You still go diving today?  Yeah.  Well, I don't combat dive for recreation.  I mean, it came out of, you know, sub-delivery, so that's the only reason I was at that depth.  You guys act like he was in the fucking Cayman Islands looking for stingrays.  Hey, look, I found a shell.  He's coming out of a submarine.  What's a sub-delivery?  Uh, that's when you exit, um, a swimmer delivery vehicle from the top of a sub or at a torpedo 
[02:51:30]  tubes.  Depends on who you're talking to.  It's much different for George than it would be for E-Rock.  Thank you, thank you.  Sub-delivery.  He likes that.  Your sub's here, fat boy.  Does the pressure get to you, though, when you're down that far?  Like, I can't even go to the bottom of a swimming pool without...  My ears hurt.  My ears ache in.  Oh, how unmanly we are.  Oh, my God.  The pressure gets to me.  I can't imagine what would happen at 240 feet. 
[02:52:00]  Believe me, you feel it.  I mean, you do exercises to pressurize yourself, but you still feel it.  Just work around it.  The thing with the bends, is that something that you have...  Do you have to come up as slowly as possible?  Or is that not deep enough for that kind of concern?  It doesn't qualify.  Okay.  Really?  Wow.  That's something.  Fontaine, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Thanks for taking the call.  Doc, it's a pleasure to talk to you, buddy.  My pleasure.  Master Chief, please show those guys the Trident.  It is the most impressive insignia in all the military in all the world. 
[02:52:30]  This is it.  We're here.  Yeah.  What's that for the Trident sub?  No.  Navy SEAL Trident.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  I thought I was going to pull out Brom or something.  That is really...  Yeah, that's impressive.  Can I...  Well, I was going to ask to wear it.  That would be crazy.  We're going to add it.  You're going to earn that shit.  Jeez.  We should go get you like a ribbon or something.  Like a sixth place ribbon or something.  Yeah, that's if you need something, you know. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, damn.  That's pretty impressive, man.  How cool is that to have a jacket with that much color and...  You walk around with that.  It's cool.  Girls everywhere.  Just girls everywhere looking.  But it must weigh you down.  It's a little cumbersome.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Must be a little heavy.  Well worth it, I'm sure.  Damn.  Well, if, you know, you take some time and get in shape, you know, you could wear that. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  So you don't think Brian's in shape?  No.  I'll do the Brian Regan workout regimen, I guess.  No, I'm joking, man.  Obviously.  Obviously, you could just snap my neck and fly and go under 240 feet of water and damn.  That would be funny.  And you tell jokes.  No, Brian could stretch out his act for 10 minutes if need be.  I don't like getting heckled.  Right.  If the waitresses are still handing out checks, they could stretch a little. 
[02:54:00]  It would be funny if you got heckled the same way he did with an AK.  Yeah.  Oof.  Jeez.  I don't know how many bullet wounds I got.  Sorry, I'm saying I want to see if Brian could shot at us, David.  Too much?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Thanks for playing.  I'll see if Brian can take a bullet.  That's wonderful.  Dave in Minnesota, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Morning.  George, I know you have some experience in the Middle Eastern Theater, and I was wondering  if maybe you could offer our friend, little Jimmy Norton, some experience for his upcoming 
[02:54:30]  deployment at the Pentages Theater in Minneapolis.  Oh.  Oh, look at that plug.  He fits a shameless plug in.  Dude, that's, I mean, that was a plug of gothic proportions, which would be the theater  I'm at in Denver the night before.  Right.  Let's go to Tom in California.  What was, oh, before Tom, what range was that Savage standing at when he shot you?  I don't know.  You don't know where it came from?  I caught fire out of the corner of my eye, rolled, and it just happened to catch me. 
[02:55:00]  Tom in California, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I'm a Marine, and I deployed to Iraq probably about a year and a half ago.  I just want to ask Mr. Chief, if this was his first deployment, and if not, how different  was it now than it was, whatever, like a year or two ago?  No, this, my deployment's been ongoing.  My only other deployment prior to this was October of 2001 to Afghanistan. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  When I went over, I mean, things were still kind of bad, but at the same time, things were  improving so much better.  So, I mean, I didn't know how well we were doing shit over there.  I just, like I said, I appreciate all your hard work and stuff like that.  I mean, coming from the military, as myself, it's a whole different world out there, and  shit, you know, shit's fucked up over there.  Yeah, so.  Understood.  So, you were in Afghanistan pretty quickly. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  So, when it first kicked up.  Yeah, about third week in October, we left.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, that's September 11th.  Yeah.  Third week of October.  Yeah, yeah.  Bush did, I don't even think Bush had signed anything by that point, as far as, I mean,  he had that big thing, oh, we're going to go after their, people wanted action, and  it was like, we're going to go after their finances.  They took a long time, and people were like, what the fuck is Bush doing?  We got hit, and yeah, October, a month later, those guys were over there.  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  That's a little over a month after it happened, they went into, I guess it was completely top  secret that you were there.  We went to Qatar.  Yeah.  Where's that?  I mean, I know the name, but I don't know exactly where.  That would be in between Kuwait and Afghanistan.  And then you went from there into Afghanistan?  Very quietly?  Mm-hmm.  Take a little look around.  Can you say how long you were there for?  I was there 22 months.  In Afghanistan?  Mm-hmm.  You ever see a werewolf?  Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly suggests there's werewolves. 
[02:57:00]  Bob Kelly believes he saw a werewolf when he was in Iraq.  I haven't seen any yet.  I've seen some hairy people, but no werewolves.  That's what we were suggesting he saw.  Dummy.  Wow, there's just a lot of calls coming in.  Let's say hi to Mark in Maryland.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  It's Master Chief.  Good to hear from you.  Got a question for you.  You ever work with Scott Helvinston?  I know the name, Scott. 
[02:57:30]  You know the name, don't you?  Mm-hmm.  It's one of the guys in Fallujah in 2004, hung and burned from the bridge.  I know.  I'm aware of that.  Yeah.  We did a memorial seal camp for him out in San Diego, out in Del Mar.  Do you know Bob Wiegand at all?  No, I don't.  You don't know Bob.  All right.  I just wanted to see if you worked with him, Master Chief, because you knew who he was.  Not a problem.  Talk to you.  So they did that.  It's just infuriating when things like that happen.  You can't even fathom it. 
[02:58:00]  How much?  Yeah, exactly.  Because it's like there's no respect whatsoever for certain Geneva Convention and things.  Like the same thing that our military is supposed to follow.  I mean, you know, again, they're religious fanatics.  They just cut your head off.  There's none of that.  It's game off.  You know, there is no equity or anything as far as any conventions go.  They get away with what they get away with, and there's no sanction.  So why bother?  And, of course, the United States military should act with a bit of, you know, nobility. 
[02:58:30]  But it just, with what you're up against over there, some of these just people that don't even have any respect for anything.  It's hard when some of our soldiers are being accused of crimes in certain areas.  And you're like, what kind of crime is this?  Why is he being court-martialed or thrown out when what they're up against is so much worse 
[02:59:00]  that you almost have to fight like that?  I never liked the idea of putting too many rules on war because it kind of takes the brutality out of it,  and I think that makes it last longer.  I mean, if you look at just the weapons used, you don't even see bayonets on weapons anymore.  You know, and that's how kind or noble a nation we are.  And, you know, it's just the progression of pansy as far as I'm concerned.  You know, you don't, you take every viable tool, every gut instinct away from an individual 
[02:59:30]  and say, no, you've got to stay within this boundary.  But fight outside, you know, fight people who are fighting outside that boundary.  Yeah, yeah.  It sort of makes it a little uneven, the playing field.  Can you give any tips to Anthony?  Because he's very afraid that he's going to be the victim of a home invasion.  I don't need any advice.  I go to the range a lot.  Yeah, but what if a Navy SEAL's coming into your house?  And clean my weapons.  How about a Navy SEAL?  You wouldn't even know he was there. 
[03:00:00]  Navy SEAL wouldn't be breaking into my house.  Why not?  Because I doubt that they would be.  You wouldn't have to.  He'd say hi to Ant.  Ant would invite him in.  Come on in.  And then he'd bash Anthony's brains.  Navy SEALs aren't idiots.  Why would you break in when you could just say, hey, stupid, I need the bathroom?  They get a little upset with me because I like having my weapons.  I enjoy them.  I have my AR-15, which I really have a lot of fun with.  I just got a nice ACOG for it and take it down to the range. 
[03:00:30]  And it's a lot of fun.  I don't hunt.  I don't like killing things.  But I do like shooting.  I find it a lot of fun and challenging.  But they classify me as like a kind of a lunatic gun nut.  And I'm proud of it.  God damn it.  God damn liberals.  You failed to mention your shotgun.  Yes.  Yes.  My 12 gauge, which is right against the bed.  And my new FS-2000, a little Belgian model.  I think it's fun. 
[03:01:00]  And it takes the same round, the .223.  I like those.  Yeah, we got to pay.  I have to pay badly.  All right, George.  Thanks for coming by.  George, thanks so much.  And I mean that for the show and for everything you do.  I mean, it's a huge honor to talk with you and to meet you, sir.  My pleasure.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  That's the great Brian Regan, too, right there.  We call him the great Brian Regan.  No, no, no.  This man is great, dude.  Show me your comedy medals.  No, no, no.  Just like laughing faces. 
[03:01:30]  This is where I took care of a heckler with this one.  A happy smile right here.  It's a tough room, and I won him over.  Let me show you a scar where a heckler threw a glass at me.  It was a rough show.  You say you introduce them.  You go, George, this is Brian.  She's a comic.  It really does put it into perspective.  It really does.  Certainly.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks to George.  No, you're not, sir.  You work for a living.  I think we got to say thank you to Brian Regan, too. 
[03:02:00]  I think he's got to go to somewhere else.  He was kind enough to come by.  Yeah, he's being deployed to the David Letterman show.  He's going to be deployed to a hotel suite right now to take a nappy.  He needs a nappy, right.  I need a nappy.  I think he's actually getting fitted for clothing for his TV appearance.  Thank you, guys.  Brian Regan, thank you for the tour dates for Brian, and we'll be right back.  Oh, spend an hour in this chair, alone in this room, and you'll feel sick.  Oh, God. 
[03:02:30]  Afraid.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Ashamed.  Ah!  What the hell?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah.  All right, we got George back on the bleachers.  We got Brian Regan.  Letterman Friday.  This way, yeah, he's going to be on Letterman on Friday.  Tapes today, but he airs on Friday.  That's right.  A couple things here. 
[03:03:00]  Anthony at a lesbian bar.  My God, man.  Yes.  My God.  I went over the weekend.  Check it out, you know?  I told you you needed to get out more, but my God.  Check it out.  Get in the closet.  Check it out.  What?  It was fascinating.  You don't just go to the Heron.  You have to start with a little pod, right?  I don't think there was anything to kind of ease into there.  It wasn't like I was entering the gay lifestyle. 
[03:03:30]  Just went and checked out some of the gayness over there.  At the Caddyshack.  The Caddyshack.  And I'm like, because I was saying on the way there, I'm going, Caddyshack, that doesn't  really sound like a gay bar.  And then I was informed, no, no, catty.  Like cats.  Yeah, because we have a guy.  I was like, oh, okay.  Now it makes more sense.  I think we have a shack or Caddyshack up there in Centerport, I believe.  Or used to.  Yeah.  It wasn't a lesbian bar. 
[03:04:00]  No, it wasn't like that.  Hardcore drinking by the locals.  Okay, Pookie.  Start chewing her rug.  Not that Caddyshack.  Jimmy, you didn't like your chicken?  It was.  It tasted a little porkish.  The place Kenny Wayne, he said, is very reputable.  But I just don't trust it.  I don't trust it.  I don't want chicken from a deli.  I want it from either fucking the Park and Meridian.  And I know the Brooklyn Dye, they don't serve it this early.  But I don't trust it from that place.  I'm sorry.  You know what? 
[03:04:30]  Delis, how many chickens can they buy?  Do they know how many that they go through in a day?  Will someone come in?  Will it be sitting there for a week?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't care how good a deli it is.  I don't want fucking circular pork chicken from a deli.  Yuck.  I don't fucking play games like that.  All right.  Pork tasting chicken.  Listen to this.  Is she still there?  What's that?  Did the lady just leave?  Yeah.  Oh, that's too bad.  She's back if you want her.  Yes.  She heard you.  Yes.  What would you like to know? 
[03:05:00]  I would like to know a response to what the gentleman said.  The gentleman's a very effective spokesperson for the company, but obviously the people who live...  Oh, I remember this clip.  Yeah.  This is an old clip.  This is from...  This is a great clip.  The Channel 5 local morning show here in New York.  Yeah.  One of these guys has since retired, but he didn't feel like his veteran reporter was  giving it his all out there in the street.  So it was like attempting to get the guy to give up more info or do more, and then they 
[03:05:30]  have a huge brawl on the air.  He wanted him to ask the woman, because he had asked this gentleman a bunch of questions.  Right.  And he wanted the woman's response, the guy back at the studio.  Sure.  And the guy in the field was just kind of like, hey, back to you.  Right.  Like, meh.  And he's like, could you ask the woman, you know, maybe she wants to respond?  He's like, all right, the woman's right here.  What do you want?  Right.  He goes, well, I'm not going to, you know, tell you.  And they get into a little bit of a tiff.  I didn't hear this.  I've never heard this.  Oh, this is a classic. 
[03:06:00]  And these guys are like, I mean, they're old timers, man.  They've been at it a real long time.  It's not like an old news guy and a brand new reporter.  They've been around the block a few times, these two.  Oh, by the way, yeah.  Tim S. from North Carolina writes, baby diaper mustache is nowhere on Google Trends yet.  Let's get a move on, people.  I think people just don't know how to spell mustache.  That's probably it, too.  We're trying to Google bomb baby diaper mustache.  That might be tough for a lot of our listeners to figure out how that is spelled. 
[03:06:30]  Let's go.  Hold on.  There's two reporters.  One is probably mad that the other guy's not doing his job.  The other guy's mad that he's being questioned.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  Exactly.  And then there's some little personal digs at the end of this that are pretty good.  I think these guys didn't like each other to begin with.  No.  This was just waiting to happen.  Is she still there?  What's that?  Did the lady just leave?  Yeah.  Oh, that's too bad.  We should have kept that discussion.  She's back if you want her.  Yes.  She heard you.  Yes.  What would you like to know?  I would like to know a response to what the gentleman said. 
[03:07:00]  The gentleman's a very effective spokesperson for the company, but obviously the people  who live there are not satisfied with his explanation.  Right.  So what do you want now?  Well, if I have to teach you how to be a reporter, Ollie, I'll do that later.  Why don't you do that later, Jim?  But I think the lady expressed herself, and you're not here.  You're there.  Is there any question you'd like me to ask her?  No.  I'll give you lessons on how to become a reporter, Ollie.  I'll give you some lessons on how to be an editor, because I was your boss once. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, you were, and are no longer.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  Hey, good morning, Jim.  Oh!  Ew!  That was Jim Ryan.  Yeah, I remember him.  He has since retired.  The guy in the studio was right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know, because we don't know what happened before this clip, Jimmy.  I saw the whole clip.  He just talked to the gentleman a lot more than he talked to the lady, and never gave the  lady a chance to rebut what the gentleman was saying, and the guy is just kind of, what 
[03:08:00]  do you want?  What do you want?  Right, right.  I'm done.  Like, he was done.  He just wanted to leave or something.  It's like, I teach you how to be a reporter.  Wow.  Yeah.  He didn't mince words of that one.  No.  And then, I used to be your boss.  Yeah, I used to be.  What happened there?  Look at these guys, so old.  They're probably both retired now.  I know Jim Ryan is, and the guy on the right looks like he should be retired as well.  Yeah.  We laughed over the last bit of the clip, so I want to get to the end of this.  Question you'd like me to ask her. 
[03:08:30]  No, I'll give you lessons on how to become a reporter later on.  I'll give you some lessons on how to be an editor, because I was your boss once.  Yeah, you were, and are no longer.  How did that happen?  Well, I don't know.  Here's Ernabel DeMillo.  Hey, good morning, Jim.  Just cut him right off.  Yeah.  And then the phoniness.  Good morning, Jim.  I'm here to do my thing now.  I'm not even going to acknowledge your argument.  Or acknowledge.  Or acknowledge.  Acknowledge.  Acknowledge.  Acknowledge.  He's got a lesbian on the brain. 
[03:09:00]  He's a stupid.  I do?  That happened.  I really thought.  Just went to the Lesbo bar.  I think you really shocked us this morning.  Timmy and I were both kind of like, what?  Yeah.  I thought you'd just kind of glaze over it, just because I said.  Anyone hit on you at the lesbian bar?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  It was just chicks and chicks, and then a couple of gay guys, I think, thrown in. 
[03:09:30]  For what?  Gay measure?  Maybe a total of like three, totally, in the whole joint.  How many guys were in the joint?  Four.  Okay.  Good answer.  I knew where you were going with that.  I had to do some quick math.  Let me see.  Hey, we got something that's been making its way around one of the fan sites.  I don't know which one.  I would give you credit.  But the Quincy clip. 
[03:10:00]  Oh.  See, Jimmy does Jim C, obviously.  Jim C.  Which is based on Quincy, obviously.  Loosely based on the Quincy character.  There's Jim C, which is exactly like Quincy.  There have been similarities.  People have pointed out.  Yeah.  No fingerprint expert.  He has certain weird clipped words.  Expert.  Clips.  And now, I guess the next stage of this bit, people are finding Quincy clips that they think  are ridiculous or funny or whatever.  And it's not supposed to be funny because it was a drama.  It was a drama.  No one really realizes that this show had credibility. 
[03:10:30]  It was a serious show.  And it was on the heels of The Odd Couple.  It was after he had left The Odd Couple as Oscar Madison.  So it was kind of odd to see him in a drama.  There was some comedic moments and comedy elements throughout the thing.  But basically, it was supposed to be like a serious show.  Right.  And at the time, I don't know how, but it was.  Because now, you listen back, and it's like, this is horrible. 
[03:11:00]  It stinks.  And when Quincy would talk, he would take his thumb, and he would take the other four fingers.  Picture going, mama me.  Right, right.  The way you do your fingers.  Mama me.  That's how he would talk.  Even when he was just talking casually.  He's a harder guy to do when he's not angry.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's always wearing a dick sweater or some fucking Iranian president members only jacket.  Is this the punk rock clip?  Yeah.  He wants to talk to a bunch of punk rockers.  This stinks. 
[03:11:30]  It's almost a parody of a show that stinks.  It's so bad.  It's so completely bad.  He's in a punk rock bar.  You want to play the first clip, even though it's slightly long?  I mean, the punk rock clips are the big get here.  But the first clip's funny because the over-the-top caring is like, why would you care about the answer?  Oh, right.  It's the one we listened to earlier.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I got you.  Well, let's start with this clip from Quincy way back in the day.  And then we'll get to the punk club.  The punk clips.  Punk. 
[03:12:00]  I can blow them up even bigger if you want, Quincy.  Oh, thanks.  You can blow them up the size of an elevator.  We still wouldn't get a clear print out of it.  Clear print.  Clear print.  Just as in my day.  Not your day.  What problems are you having?  I'm just overlapping the kids we found on the house.  That was some of Steve's acting right there.  Not your day.  That was his fucking awful boss.  John Astin, his real name was, I think?  I don't know.  Was it?  He had that fucking dumb mustache.  What was his name?  How'd your parents die?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We haven't done an autopsy.  You could blow it up as big as an elephant.  What's my problem? 
[03:12:30]  You're in my fucking house.  I'm not going to get a clear print.  Print.  Clear print.  Here, listen to the Steve actor by the other guy.  This isn't my day.  It's not your day.  What problems are you having?  I'm just overlapping the kids we found on the ice cream.  These?  Yeah.  Well, what about them?  Well, we blow them up.  Hoping to squeeze some more information out of them, but no such luck.  You know, Quincy, maybe there is a way to unscramble these prints.  Yeah, it's like trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube.  There isn't a fingerprint man alive who'll get a positive ID based on what's here.  Not a man, but a machine, maybe. 
[03:13:00]  Machine?  I had visions of buying one until I looked at the price.  Remember that computer show I went to in May?  At the convention center?  Yeah.  Who cares where it was?  I love it.  At the convention center?  No, no, the arena.  You sure?  Because I remember the one at the convention center.  Right.  Who cares where it was?  A computer show at the convention center where they have one computer?  Yeah, one computer.  See, because they were real large back then.  That's my large computer joke.  It was so bad, the information they were giving.  It was too pricey back in May at the convention center. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Just a machine?  Machine.  What, a computer?  A machine?  I was going to get one, but it was a little too pricey.  Oh, you were Jew.  So because it was too pricey, there's like dozens of murders they're not going to solve.  Yeah.  It's too pricey.  It's not too pricey.  I'll try to do it the old-fashioned way and save a few bucks.  We would have fingerprints, Sam, but the boss is a Jew.  This guy never saw a penny that he didn't like. 
[03:14:00]  We can't get a clear print.  A clear print.  I bet we could get clear prints off a penny from your pocket.  A pocket.  You're a Jew.  This is an anti-Semite.  There's six million of them, Sam, and they're hiding somewhere.  Bobby Fisher was right.  The whole thing was a lie.  They were never murdered.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas. 
[03:14:30]  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking crime lab.  You're in my...  Quincy.  My.  My.  Yeah.  This plot was murdered.  Here, let's go back to this clip.  At the convention center?  Yeah.  Quincy, they had a graphics computer that could take two combined pictures  and separate the images.  No.  Do you remember who was displaying it?  But I was too cheap to buy it.  Too cheap.  Oy vey, Quincy. 
[03:15:00]  Right.  Do you remember who was displaying it?  Come tell.  Maybe I'll just give them a call.  Pick up some modern computer equipment there, huh?  Help Quincy out.  Right.  It could actually separate two sets of fingerprints and play pong at the same time.  Yeah.  That's awful.  So then Quincy, in this particular episode, he goes to a punk rock club. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  And he convinces the punk rock club manager to let him go on stage and talk to the youth.  He wanted to talk to the kids.  But do you have...  It is the part where he's trying to convince them.  If I could just convince them.  And the fuck...  He's wearing this shit dick sweater.  Yeah.  And the manager stinks.  Go ahead.  It's so bad.  Good luck.  If you want to, good luck with that.  And the punk rock kids are...  Not kids, first of all.  Right out of central casting, as they like to say. 
[03:16:00]  Just awful.  The dialogue.  Hey, man.  Right.  They're just really not convincing.  They look like they have Halloween costumes on.  It doesn't...  Yeah, it looks like now how you would Halloween dress as a punk.  Right, of course.  Well, they can't have real punk rockers on TV.  That would scare the shit out of everybody.  It was wholesome TV back then.  It was adult flushing this.  The biggest they could get if they have a punk rock character.  But look at how fucking fast the music shuts down.  They're all quiet.  Listen, there's nothing not awful about this. 
[03:16:30]  It's amazing how they took awfulness and they just stretched it over a bunch of moments.  And wasn't punk rock all about, fuck the establishment.  Yeah.  Establishment.  And as soon as Quincy walks on, obviously, he's the establishment.  Oh, the music shuts down.  Everyone is quiet immediately.  They'd be like, what the fuck?  Wouldn't you just start throwing chairs at the man?  I wish it was a Gigi Allen show.  Right.  He could shit in Quincy's face.  Fucking shit out of banana.  He just shoved up his ass into Quincy's mouth. 
[03:17:00]  Him and his brother Merle would have homosexual relations, Sam.  He's pissing on the crowd.  Gigi.  A Gigi Allen show.  Fucking Gigi rules.  I want to talk to the murder junkies.  The murder junkies.  Murder junkies.  Here's something about Gigi.  Oh, yeah.  Could we stop the muse?  He's throwing feces at me, Sam. 
[03:17:30]  So what's new?  You never liked me, so I said, fuck you.  Yeah.  Quincy tapping his foot, singing along.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Quincy's shoving a banana up his ass and throwing it at the audience.  With those stupid Mamma Mia fingers.  Mamma Mia fingers.  Looks like the Italian guy on a pizza box.  Yeah, exactly what it is.  I can just talk to him.  Everything's an intense moment.  How about this?  You give us an autopsy report and then go fuck cardboard ass. 
[03:18:00]  Cardboard ass.  Because that's all you're supposed to do.  Exactly.  The coroner isn't going out investigating at some punk rock club.  Of course he's not.  He's a coroner.  He's a cop.  He's a lover.  He's an alcoholic.  He rubs his fucking dirty balls on his boss's awful mustache.  And he fingers Lieutenant Monaghan's ass when he's fucking tired.  Busy man, that Quincy.  They play Let's Check the Prostate.  We both know what it's about.  Sticks his whole hand in there with his Mamma Mia hand.  Just four or five fingers go up there.  I'm going to fist you. 
[03:18:30]  Here we go.  This is Quincy talking to the punk rock club manager.  Before he goes on stage.  We need your help.  I want to go on stage for two minutes and talk to the kids.  Maybe you'd like to take over to the opening act.  You paint a target on your head, I might arrange it.  I want to find an innocent girl.  You don't want anybody innocent.  Yeah.  It's too much to ask for a few minutes to try to save a life.  Hey, be my guest.  But if you expect any of these kids to help you out, you've got another guest coming. 
[03:19:00]  Go ahead.  This should be fun.  That's punk rock, by the way.  Go ahead.  This should be fun.  It sounds like...  I am rock quarry.  And listen to the music that's supposed to represent punk rock.  Yeah, that was the punk rock band playing in the background.  See, they can't even commit because it's stupid TV.  It's just some kind of easy listening rock.  Kind of like Dwayne Allman or something.  It's not punk.  No, that was punk, man.  I want to help an innocent girl.  Girl.  And the guy is like, well, baby, you've got another guest coming if you think those kids. 
[03:19:30]  It's like they took everyone who auditioned and started from the bottom up like the worst  actor got the game.  No, then you heard, well, what are you going to say when you go up there?  If that's the guy that got it, how bad were the ones that didn't?  What did they say?  No, that's no good.  You didn't speak English.  It was close.  All right.  We'll give him a call back.  All right.  Here's Quincy trying to talk to the kids from the stage, man.  Please tell me the awful music stops.  I think so, yeah. 
[03:20:00]  Please, can I be a gesture?  Please.  It's very important.  There you go.  Wow.  Dead silence.  Wow, just like that.  Not shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Who are you?  Put the music back on, asshole.  Yeah, what happened to fuck the man?  Please, can I be a gesture?  Please.  It's very important.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, many of you know Abigail Garvin.  Garvin. 
[03:20:30]  And all of you know that the police are looking for in connection with a murder that happened  right here in front of this stage.  Now, all the charges against her have been dropped.  She's innocent.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her.  Why should we believe you?  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's all you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  This is so fucking bad.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah. 
[03:21:00]  I'm rubbing your glue.  Sticks and stones can break my bones.  That's right.  But names will never hurt that girl.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  You can call me a coroner.  You can call me a sloppy sports reporter.  Just over the top acting.  Flat-ass fucker, right.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her.  Why should we believe you?  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's all you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform. 
[03:21:30]  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  I'm only interested in helping Abby.  This is right out of a John Wayne movie.  There's four people in the club.  That guy's killing.  Yeah, there's like 20 people.  Big crazy club.  Yeah.  He's just a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Names you call me.  An asshole.  He is just the worst.  I'm rubber, you're glue.  Sam has tiny genitals.  Look, we have reason to believe that she's with Zach's real murderer, Molly Howard. 
[03:22:00]  And Molly is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  So please, if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're the killer.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy scapegoat.  Besides, man.  The scapegoat?  Who the hell cares?  And Clint leaves the stage.  Dejected.  Moping.  And unsuccessful.  Oh, well. 
[03:22:30]  Mamma Mia hands in pocket.  And he gives all the details.  Molly Howard is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  Yeah.  What?  They would just be sitting there going, what?  An extra aspirin?  I mean, wow.  A codeine overdose?  What?  A little outrageous, huh?  Whoa, hey.  Molly Howard is trying to get her to take Tylenol PM.  She's giving her melatonin.  Instead of regular Tylenol, it's Tylenol PM.  It's just horrid dialogue.  She's taking Abby's Breathe Right strips and rubbing them in her own ass crack first. 
[03:23:00]  Considering they won't be invented for years.  Stupid Quincy.  Quincy stinks.  Quincy's a cunt.  He stinks.  But listen again.  It's the typical punk rock speech, man.  Yeah, man.  You're the problem, man.  Society.  Society's the problem.  Does the dopey kid say a scapegoat?  He says a scapegoat.  Your whole sick society with his dumb accent.  Look, we have reason to believe that she's with Zach's real murderer, Molly Howard, 
[03:23:30]  and Molly is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  So please, if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're the killers.  Your whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy escape goat.  Besides, man.  Escape goat.  Who the hell cares?  Yeah.  That really got him right there.  When the kid said, who the hell cares?  Yeah.  It's like, well, no one cares. 
[03:24:00]  How do I battle that?  Smokezilla writes, Cody and Overdose, are they doing cough syrup shooters?  And someone else, Jimmy Jakes writes, I love that they just all take turns yelling at Quint.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't all jump on at once and shut the fuck up.  Your line, my line, her line, his line, back to me line.  You're sick society.  Society.  And he said, escape goat.  Escape goat.  It's like, he was wrong.  The word is escape, and he shouldn't have used it there. 
[03:24:30]  No.  Anyway.  There you go.  Some Quincy audio.  Yeah.  That was an actual, a legitimate program back then.  Yeah.  Were people just dumber back then?  Was TV all so bad and unrealistic that-  We just didn't know any better, man.  It was that sick society.  I don't know.  It just seems like something like, we should have looked and gone, I don't think a coroner 
[03:25:00]  does this.  Mm-hmm.  Listen to this.  It's wonderful.  Is that Van?  Van on piano.  He plays a piano.  By all accounts  Well, you were in  Bending over backwards  Until you split  And maybe all you want 
[03:25:30]  Will hurt you in some way  I never thought of you  But I thought that you were safe  What is that?  Am I supposed to not guess?  Yeah.  What do you think this is?  We could play three questions.  It's a tribute song.  Yeah, I assume.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Sounds a little Christopher Cross-y.  Let's see.  A tribute song.  Gates writes, tearing apart Quincy today, ripping Hill Street Blues tomorrow.  Yeah.  We acknowledge that the whole Quincy thing is old, but it's just taken on a life of its own.  Ancient.  That's the fun thing to do.  That's the fun of it.  Of course.  We're not going to do it every show.  So you got a tribute song here.  Yeah.  Song is all you want.  All you want? 
[03:26:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It's, um, I'll help you out with this much.  Um, it's pretty much the one-year anniversary.  Uh-huh.  Of something.  And this fine, uh, singer-songwriter is, uh, singing about it.  Uh.  Let's see.  One year, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Corey Lytle?  That's a crock, mister. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah!  Yeah, I'm a, I'm a punk with respect.  Mister, yes, sir.  Very good, Charlie.  The worst line in the entire day.  You think we're all zombie killers?  I know.  Did she mean zombie killers or zombie killers?  Right.  Like, is she proficient in killing zombies?  No, they're zombies that kill.  Or they're zombies that kill.  Okay.  But you don't have to say zombie killers.  Zombies in general are supposed to kill, right?  Yeah.  The writing is awful.  And the acting is worse. 
[03:27:30]  On this song?  I don't know what this song is.  Who the hell was, like, writing that?  You're right.  Who was sitting there going, yeah, this is good.  All right.  Here we are at the table read.  All right.  Go through this dialogue.  And no one laughing.  Are you shitting me?  You think we're all zombie killers?  Yeah, it's a good line.  You're the killers.  Punks would say that.  Punks.  Punks.  John from Virginia.  Anna Nicole Smith.  No.  Can we hear it a little bit again?  Because I didn't know what it was. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  A little more of the song.  Please, sweetie.  Of the world's killers You were the best With such a knowing smile  Who could have guessed That all you want Will hurt you in some way  You gave it all But still had hell to pay 
[03:28:30]  Now, once upon the end  Now, this song is half over and you still have no idea.  I'm very confused.  I don't know what he's talking about.  I can't understand it.  I think he's talking about a killer. 
[03:29:00]  To Madeline McCann.  Just talking about Madeline McCann.  Mm-mm.  Um.  Mm-mm.  Her mother, who I'm in love with.  Mm-mm.  Really?  How are you?  You are my friend  Let the roadies take the stage  A little Jackson Brown action.  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  Down two minutes left in the song.  I still don't have an idea, huh?  Okay, here it comes.  And so I fall  To the perfect grind  After years of song  You breathe in for the first time  And maybe all you want  Will hurt you in some way  I listen more than ever 
[03:30:00]  But it doesn't sound the same  Ooh  Here's something  When you're telling your little stories  Have a point!  It makes it so much more interesting  To the listeners.  What is that?  I have no fucking idea. 
[03:30:30]  It's a Brad Delp tribute song.  Who the fuck is Brad Delp?  Oh my god, the singer from Boston  Who killed himself with a barbecue  A year ago already  Wait, wait  With a barbecue  He killed himself?  Oh, yeah  Where were you?  I know he died  But I didn't know it was a suicide  Yeah  Oh, fuck yeah  Notes and everything  The lead singer of Boston?  Yeah, he was  Oh, I did not realize that  Yeah  He put his dogs in another room  So they wouldn't die  Or were a dog, I don't know  And had notes all over the house  To be careful  Because there's going to be  Poisonous gas in the house  And lit a barbecue in his room 
[03:31:00]  He basically said  Where you could find him  And I guess his bedroom  Had an outside door or something  And he rolled the barbecue in  What did he do that for?  Um, to  To end his life  But why though?  Was he into the dope?  Was he sick of putting out an album  Once every 35 years?  Go ahead, fuck him  I didn't know he committed suicide  I'm glad I didn't get that message  A year later  Fuck you and your notes  That is a little vague  It's extremely vague 
[03:31:30]  I've got a numb feeling  Yeah, that might have helped  Anthony sang with Brad  Dealt back in the day  I'm sorry  I did  Um, you did?  Yes  Oh, I thought you were asking  Oh, no  I was making a statement  I did  All you want  I don't know  Didn't wake up this morning  The barbecue was on  Sorry  Turned on the barbie  To get some heat  He died March 9th 
[03:32:00]  At the age of 55  Oh, Paul Shirehorse  Is checking in today  Shirehorse  From Bohemia  Thank you, Mr. Shirehorse  So  Yeah  How old was that?  A year ago already?  Yeah  Jesus Christ  And the song  Is by an artist  Named Chris Blake  And we don't really  Get it  Chris  Sorry  Some guy has a pleasant voice  I'll give him that much  Who, Brad?  No, that guy  Like, he had kind of  A pleasant voice 
[03:32:30]  The song wasn't  It was, you know  Faggy and all  But it wasn't an awful  Like, oh my god  This is an awful  Song kind of a thing  Hey, what are the songs?  When you say pleasant voice  Do you mean like  James Blunt pleasant?  Yeah, yeah  Sort of like that  Like James Blunt pleasant  Yeah  And the piano playing  He had some interesting  Little vocal things  Going on in there  I thought  Uh-huh  Didn't completely  Bite ass  Than, did it?  No  I don't know  Okay, thank you 
[03:33:00]  The piano was alright  Musically  Yeah, yeah  Musically was okay  The words were just  Very vague  Yeah, it was a little vague  I guess, you know  He conveyed what he wanted to  But  I like tribute songs  That really suck a cock  That's what I like  Real bad ones  Didn't we?  Like that, remembering Lacey  Yeah  It's probably the worst  Tribute song I ever heard  In my life  It's one of the funniest lines  In the history of the show  Oh god  It's when he goes  Hey mama, these for you  And Anthony said  It was a bouquet of seaweed  That was one of those 
[03:33:30]  Fucking  I collapsed laps  Oh dude  We'd tear that one apart  Oof  And they're still dead  Alright, well  Thank god  What happened with them?  Who?  What?  Lacey  Oh, yeah, still dead  Yeah  Oh, very  I think we're ready  For line of the day  I think  Line of the day  We also have a gambler  That's suing a casino  Ugh  You heard this story, right?  Yeah, this is great  Maybe you should stay  Out of the casinos  If you're gonna be suing them 
[03:34:00]  Do you wanna hear this real fast  Before we do line of the day?  Oh, please  You bet  Alright, we could do this  You bet  I get it  I didn't even mean  I swear to god  You just naturally  Just roll the dice  Naturally  Have a seat  I gotta take a crap  Oh, crap  Amelia Tavares  Once had the career  Of her dreams  As a successful lawyer  Earning hundreds of thousands  Of dollars a year  I had many friends  And it was  A nice  Nice existence  You were a lawyer  Off steam  She enjoyed fun-filled 
[03:34:30]  Gambling weekends  In Atlantic City  But over time  Those weekends  Became weeks  And the days  Stretched into  Long nights  I realized  It was an addiction  The last  Towards the latter days  When I was losing  All that money  And breaking out  Into sweats  In the middle of the night  Yeah, really?  Scumbag lawyer  Good for you  Yeah  That's what you get  Well, she's  Trying to sue the casino  Though, Jimmy  Just that  That's a typical  Lawyer move  Don't take responsibility 
[03:35:00]  For your own actions  Blame somebody else  No, it's gotta be  Someone else's fault  During one five-day  Gambling joint  She says she lived  On nothing but  Orange juice  And Snickers  Offered by the casino staff  I was sitting there  For days at a time  I mean  I used to use  Wipes  To brush my teeth  Two and a half years  Years later  She hit bottom  Gambling away  Nearly a million dollars  Using her home  And her job  She even stole money  From the escrow accounts  Of her clients  What were in your mind  When they're compulsive  Gamble  You don't think it's stealing 
[03:35:30]  And you had a problem  I just didn't know  What to do about it  At that point  You knew it was stealing  You fucking liar  You don't know  You're stealing  Shut the fuck up  You're a liar  Now she's suing  Six casinos  In Atlantic City  And one in Las Vegas  For twenty million dollars  Twenty  Claiming they had a duty  To notice her compulsive gambling  And cut her off  I hate lawyers  The casinos deny any wrongdoing  Saying Aurelia brought  The problems on herself  I think that  Where the casino's  Responsibility begins  And ends  Is an open question  We would say 
[03:36:00]  That there's got to be  Shared responsibility  Of course the gambler  Has to take responsibility  For their own actions  You know they have to  Take responsibility  For the fact  If they have an uncontrollable  Urge to gamble  They need to go get help  And how is she  How did she lose  A million  And is suing  For twenty million  Yeah how does that work  God how do you justify  Blaming other people  For your own  Shit  She hits a twenty  To one shot  If she wins  Yeah  Yeah  There's no way  She could take responsibility  Ah 
[03:36:30]  It's a casino  The responsibility  Ends when you walk  Through the fucking door  If they  If they drag you in there  And made you bet  Then there'd be a problem  Why are you so uptight man  I think we found  Your soulmate here  Hey look man  I think we found  It's the establishment  Of the casinos  I think we found  Your soulmate though  Really  A gambler  That doesn't know  What to say no  Ain't me  That ain't me  My friend  And I sure as shit  Ain't gonna sit there 
[03:37:00]  And have orange juice  And snickers  They're fucking  Feeding me good food  That's right  It ain't you right  How do you lose that much  And you don't get comped  You dumb cunt  Cause she's a fucking lawyer  Everyone hates her  I wonder if she would've sued  If she won  Yeah how about that  The compulsion was the same  And she was winning  I wonder if she would've sued  Yeah cause the compulsion  Would've been exactly the same  She'd've gotten the same  Thrill  Feeling  But sitting there  Just as long  I'm sure  Brushing her teeth  With wipes  That's wonderful  Isn't it 
[03:37:30]  Alright  I hate this woman  An estimated  6 to 9 million Americans  Have a gambling problem  And Aurelia's hoping  Her lawsuit  Will help put the responsibility  For the addiction  On the casino owner  Casinos think that  Because they put a sign  On the door  That that's enough  It's not enough  These people have surveillance  Where they watch you  They are protecting themselves  Against you  So you need to  Protect yourself  Against them  Oh shut up  They turned her into  Some kind of zombie gambler  Man  It's the casinos 
[03:38:00]  Just  Mind-boggling  Well the news  Is giving her attention  You lost your money  Fucking  Learn a lesson  And leave  Go screw  It's compulsive behavior  It's not  It's not an addiction  It's this compulsion  I think it's an addiction  But I  I think it's an addiction  Oh yeah absolutely  But it doesn't  It's still your responsibility  It's not the casino  Responsibility  Yeah I think so  I mean again  I see guys 
[03:38:30]  That behave so irrationally  It can only be  Describe  Voss  Talk to Voss about it  I mean  It's just  It's a horrendous  One to have  Is there a difference  Between an addiction  And a compulsion  I'm sure medically  There might be  Because I  I would think that is  What  What's the actual addiction  It's  It's  Because there's so many  Different dynamics  To gambling  It's  It's about escaping  Basically  It's  It's like alcohol  Food 
[03:39:00]  Sex  It's all  Lesbian bars  Branches  Are the same  Thing  Alcohol  Is gonna give you  The reaction  You know you're getting  You  There's  There's  You might win  Or you might lose  At gambling  Right  A lot  There's different dynamics  If you might be happy  You might be sad  Right  You might be sitting  With fun people  You might be sitting  With miserable people  Like I  It's this odd  Thing though  That I  Can't see as an addiction  Like there's no  Tangible thing 
[03:39:30]  Except for the thrill  Which I don't think  You can be addicted  To a thrill  I think you could have  A compulsion  To want a thrill  I don't know  I always think of addictions  As being some kind of  Tangible substance  Or something like that  How about addictive relationships  I just did a Quincy hand  People get involved in those  Slap me  Addiction is basically  I mean  It's almost like  To me it's  Like they say  Obsession is a thought  Over which reason  Has no power  Like  It's almost like  Logic means nothing 
[03:40:00]  In this behavior  I can  You can't  Frighten somebody  Into not doing it  You can't scare  Somebody into not drinking  You can't scare  A compulsive over reader  Into not  You know  I mean  In a court of law  I might not be able  To argue this case  But anyone who has it  Knows it  Yeah  And only addiction  Explains  The mania  In which you pursue it  And the sacrifices  You're willing to make  I mean  Nobody  Thinking  Who doesn't have  Some kind of sickness 
[03:40:30]  Would put their  Children's college tuition  Up on a card game  It's lunacy  It's fucking lunacy  Nobody would drink  And get behind the wheel  Of a car  Like  You understand what I'm saying  It's like these things  That there's no rational explanation  For whatsoever  I guess I'm just thinking of it  As a physical addiction  When I think addiction  I think some kind of physical  Your body  Needs something  That you can't  Stop taking  Or else  Your body 
[03:41:00]  And mind  Is going to react to it  Gambling  It's different  It's different I think  Than eating  Or alcohol  Or drugs  And that you're really not  Except for maybe adrenaline  But I don't know how much adrenaline  You're actually pumping out  By gambling  For so long  You're not getting  That much  I mean  It just seems odd to me  That it's an addiction  An addiction to losing  Your fucking house  And family  And shit like that  Like drugs and alcohol  Is an addiction 
[03:41:30]  That  The byproduct of which  Is you can lose  Your money  Your family  Your house  But gambling  Is kind of like  I don't know  It doesn't seem to fit  In the same category  Well it's not a physical thing  Like say  I mean  Like alcohol  But again  Even with physical  There's different stuff  Like the food compulsion  The food obsession  Is tough  Because you have to eat  You can't be abstinent  But with alcohol  You can be abstinent  It's like  Every one of them  Has different components  And when I talk  To compulsive gamblers 
[03:42:00]  They're the same guy I am  And that's how I know it is  Because the 12 steps  The suggested steps  In certain programs  Are almost  They're very very similar  With maybe a couple of words  Here and there changed  Yeah  We do it for the same reason  We act out for the same reason  It's almost like  When you take all these  Different people  And you find out  It's the exact  Same person  You know it's coming  From the same  I hate to say  Root to the same  But whatever you want  To worry  It's all coming  From that same core  That same  Personality defect 
[03:42:30]  That same flaw  In the fucking  In the psyche  Or in the personal makeup  It's almost like  Women who have never met  Who have been abused  As children  Will a lot of times  Marry an abuser  It's like  There's something to that  It's something  I'm not saying  That that's an addiction  But all these different people  Behaving in a similar way  There is something  Connecting in that  And I think that  It is an addiction  I mean  I know enough gamblers  To know that  But is it physical  Like alcohol  I guess not  Yeah it's just an odd thing 
[03:43:00]  I don't know  What the difference  Between compulsion  Is  I don't know  I don't know  Maybe somebody out there  Knows  The phones are lit  I mean somebody might know  Well let's see  What Craig's got  Craig what's up  Hey how's it going guys  Hey Craig  I worked in a casino  For quite a few years  And I mean  After you know  Being addicted  I'm an alcoholic  I mean I've been addicted  To pain pills  Cope  I mean you name it  And I mean it really  Is the same addiction  I mean the endorphins 
[03:43:30]  That it releases  In your mind  Or in your brain  Are I mean very similar  To the same  That you get  That first time  You do that first line  Of coke  Yeah  And people switch addictions  Like for me  The sex got so much worse  When I quit drinking  And drugging  And for a lot of people  The weight gets tremendous  It's like you just  You just replace  One with the other  It's not the right thing  To do  But I mean  It's about  He's right  It's about that dopamine  Fucking that endorphin  That release  The escape you get  Yeah  The fucking  So how the fuck  Do you get around that  Um 
[03:44:00]  Well you have to  Kind of surrender to it  I guess  You do  You have to surrender to it  If it's an actual  Chemical thing that happens  How the fuck  Do you get around that  Oh well  It's as part of it  Is you know  Retraining yourself  And fucking  A lot of times  Find a good addiction  What's that buddy  I said find a good addiction  Like for me  I mean when I  When I decided to get sober  And just be a father  Instead of a man's man  I guess  It was uh  Like lifting weights  You know  It released the same  Sort of endorphins  In my mind  And it was more  Of a healthy addiction 
[03:44:30]  For me  It's all about  Filling the hole  Like you have a hole in you  But that was really interesting  What he just said  It's like  Find a good addiction  That gives you that same feeling  That is an actual good thing  So you're acknowledging  That you actually  Can't get rid of  The releasing  Of this adrenaline  Or these  Or this chemical reaction  That goes on in your brain  Yeah but it's  So to counteract it  You try to like  Replace it with some kind  Of good addiction  But it's almost like  It's just interesting  I don't know  Eating cake  Right  Instead of eating broccoli  You know  It's like hey  Just replace the food  With healthy food  It doesn't taste as good 
[03:45:00]  As the cake  So going to the gym  And working out  You're going to release  Endorphins  It's going to feel  Good that you did that  But it's never going to feel  As good as an addiction  As something you're addicted to  I was having a discussion  About eating healthy  This weekend  And at first  You're absolutely right  But I'm to the point now  Where I've searched out  Enough healthy foods  That I really enjoy  These particular healthy foods  It's not like I'm suffering  And when I do eat  Like a huge piece  A cheesecake or whatever  Like I used to  And really enjoy it  Now I almost get  Like a sick feeling  If I eat an entire 
[03:45:30]  Piece of cheesecake  And one of the keys  That you do  I'm not comparing that  To gambling  And boozing  And all that  But I wonder  If there's something there  If you slowly  Train yourself  Shit tastes better  Well you have to find out  Why you do these things  That's why there's  A program  Or there's different programs  Different methods  Different people  But you have to find out  Why you do it  And fix whatever  The personality flaws are  Because it's not  About the substance  It's about  It's like underneath  The substance  Whether it's gambling  It's that thing in me 
[03:46:00]  That fucking hole  That I'm constantly  Trying to fill with things  Outside of myself  And I'll try to fill them  At any cost  Whether it's sex  Whether it's compulsively  Eating bad food  Or whether it's fucking  Drinking  Or drugs  Like why do I  Fucking get addicted  To everything like that  Like if gambling  Frightens me  I certainly understand  How that can become  The addiction  It's so much fun  I'm the same guy  I know it is  I know  But again  Then it goes down  And you lose  If they say gamblers 
[03:46:30]  It's really not about  The winning and losing  It's the fucking high  It's the chase  I mean that's a big part  I love winning  I hate losing  Sure  I want to win  But you still chance it  Right  David  Let me get this in  David from OB  Wherever that is  Jim is absolutely right  Addictive  Addiction is a behavior  OB to get around it  You must realize  What triggers the addiction  At  That  I typed this awfully  OB to get around it  You must realize  What triggers the addiction  At first  When it first enters your mind 
[03:47:00]  Addicts will actually feel better  Before they act on their compulsion  Just a sense of  Where's the rest of this  David you're killing me  Good instant feedback  And I did say good instant feedback  Because it started off fine  Where the fuck is the rest of it  Ah whatever  Sorry  Steve  I understand what he's saying  I understand what he's saying completely  Oh  Yeah  Without a mic  Oh wait  My guy  Oh sorry  I didn't even realize 
[03:47:30]  No I understand what he's  I understand what he's saying  The  The  The trigger is often  The thing you have to sense  Before you actually do it  That's part of retraining your body  As  Retraining your mind  To  To acknowledge  These feelings  When they happen  A lot of times it's stress  A lot of times  It's a stressful situation  That'll have somebody  Act out in a form  That  You know  In an addictive form  Or a compulsive form  Whether it's  Eating or drinking  Or gambling  It's  It's  It's a stress deterrent  You know  So some people  Will have 
[03:48:00]  Like emotionally  Charged situations  And they'll immediately  Go to the bottle  Or they'll immediately  Overeat  Or they'll immediately  Look for you know  For some quick way  To get laid  It's just  That's what they do  And you have to  Recognize those triggers  And interrupt them  Before  Before you act out on them  And I think that's  What he was trying to say  And it will also  It's like with an addiction  You  Like with  I can always say drinking  But say we drink  You drink to celebrate  You drink to mourn  These things are done  To do 
[03:48:30]  To feel anything  It's almost like  I can give myself  An excuse as to  Why I'm drinking  But the bottom line  Is I'm drinking  Because I want to drink  That's it  I'm drinking  Because I need to drink  That's it  You know  We drank to celebrate  Good times  We drank to mourn  Bad times  Then all of a sudden  You drank because  It's Tuesday  You drank because  It's early  It didn't matter  The reasons  Really don't matter  Right  The compulsion  Or the obsession  I think it's all  Part of the same thing  I'm going to do this  I'm going to act out  You know  Gamblers  I'm sure there's a million  Gamblers  I'll tell you  They were gambling  Because they fucking  Felt so great  They wanted to go down  And celebrate and gamble 
[03:49:00]  And then they were gambling  Because they were depressed  And they wanted to get out  Of their own heads  I was gambling  To win something  I was gambling  To make up for a loss  I was gambling  Because I didn't give a shit  There's a million  Yeah reasons  But the bottom line  Bottom line is  You strip all that shit away  I'm gambling  Because there's a fucking  Giant hole in the middle of me  And I don't know how to fill it  With fucking healthy things  It sounds corny  But that really is  The common thread  Jim McSweeney writes  I just turned on XM  Are you guys having  An intervention for Anthony today?  I'm just talking about gambling 
[03:49:30]  Yeah but why can't you  Fill that shit up  With positive things?  That's what they say to do  You can  Yeah you do  You just have to learn  How to do it  But is it as easy  As filling it up  With positive things?  Well you have to  I don't hear about  That side of this ever  It's not easy  No it's not easy  You have to  That's why there's programs  That's why there's  Enormously populated programs  Full of people  Who have the same  Personality conflict  That are all trying to  I'd imagine if you  Start filling up  That emptiness  With positive things  There'd be a guilt  That is associated 
[03:50:00]  With the fact that  You're filling it up  With positive things  Well you have to  You know what I mean?  You have to gut  Your personality first  You have to go through  Certain process  Of kind of figuring out  Why it is you do this shit  And you kind of  Have to go back  Over your life  And look at these  Patterns that have developed  Because the patterns  Are what happens  And then you learn this  You tell another person about  There's a lot of things  You can do  And you begin to  Change your personality  Like the flaws in it  Not the good parts  But you change these  Like you said  Triggers  And a lot of them  Go way back to childhood  You didn't know  They were there  But it doesn't sound 
[03:50:30]  Easy by any means  It's not easy  It's not easy  Like do you guys  Do you guys still crave  Drink  Drink no  Not really  Occasionally the thought  Will come  But my mind  Has gotten more clever  It doesn't just say drink  But it does get me  Trying to self-destruct  Yeah the self-destructive  Urge is always there  You just figure other ways  Steve you really don't want  To drink anymore  Nope  It's been a little over a year  I don't want to like  Get too much into it  It's been over a year  But I've also been  Going to meetings  You know  No I understand all that  But do you actually  You know what I mean  Like you  You don't really have  A desire to drink 
[03:51:00]  Right now  Don't have a desire to drink  But self-destruction  Takes all different forms  And it could lead you  Back toward that  Yeah I mean you could  I could go  I could easily start  Eating too much again  You know I could easily  You know I was never  Big into drugs  But you know I could see  How people could switch  Back and forth  To different addictions  At least you're open-minded  You're willing  You know you're willing  To move on  And try other things  Move on to men  I'm on to cigars now  To move on to men  And boys  Ooh  But  Day joke  Oh I'm gay 
[03:51:30]  Right  Alright  Sorry  Yeah look at that  Mark the time on that one  No it's very  Thank you Sean  It's very interesting  No you just  You know  It's all the same  Jim hit on this a few times  It's all  Whether it's drinking  Whether it's gambling  Whether it's eating  Whether it's sex  Whether it's any number of things  It's all symptoms  Of the same self-destructive pattern  That everybody shares  You are  You are constantly searching  To find something  To fill this gaping hole  Inside you  And  Rather than fill it 
[03:52:00]  With something constructive  The immediate urge  Is to do it with something  That soothes  Which is usually  Completely destructive  And  My self-destructive behavior  Comes from my mom  Because she was  Extremely self-destructive  When we were growing up  And fucking up a lot of shit  And I finally  I only realized that recently  I only realized that recently  Where it comes from  In me  And I'm working on it  But  I'm like  I had a realization  Only less than a year ago  Going  Holy shit  I know exactly  Where this comes from 
[03:52:30]  It's been in front of my eyes  My entire life  Now do you interrupt it  I never made that  Huh?  Do you interrupt it now  When you feel it coming  When you feel the  Oh my god  I mean I  I definitely got a ways to go  But I'm  A hell of a lot better  Than I used to be  A hell of a lot better  And I didn't understand  That behavior  Until I  Had a realization  I'm like  Oh okay  I see what this is all about  Some people never get it  Hey Thang  Can you look up the difference  Between compulsion and obsession  I think there is a site  Someone has been  Sending us a link  Over and over again 
[03:53:00]  Oh you got it?  Yep  Do you want me to read the answer?  Yeah go ahead  Answer  A compulsion is based upon  The psychological principles  Of dependency  Need and desire  Although compulsive behavior  May have physiological aspects  Attached to it  Such as feelings of satiation  And psychological withdrawal  Compulsion does not alter the brain  The way addiction does  Hmm  Compulsive behavior  That is  Secondary  Oof  Compulsive behavior  That is secondary  To an obsessive compulsive disorder 
[03:53:30]  Is a neurobiologically acquired  Mental illness  Addiction on the other hand  Is a medical term  That refers to  To a neurobiological process  That in addition to  Compulsion  Obsession  Loss of control  And a continuation  In spite of dangerous consequences  Also must include  As part of its definition  A progressive neuronal  Neuronal desensitization  And a brain based  Neurochemical alteration  Oh my god  I'm guessing that  Desensitization  I'm guessing  Means that you need  More and more  To get off  And all of a sudden  It's almost like  Jacking off 
[03:54:00]  Like a porno movie  Just won't do it anymore  You gotta go through  Four or five porno movies  Because you become desensitized  Halfway through that  I got white noise  In my brain  I had the same feeling  I had trying to read  Like a manual  For a computer  You gotta dig deep  You gotta dig deep  And listen closely  I was trying  It keeps going  The important part there  Was that you said  That doing these things  It's a compulsion  It kind of mixed up  With obsession  Doing things despite  What was it  Dangerous consequences  Or whatever  Yes  Okay  I mean that's  Gambling certainly  Because it obviously 
[03:54:30]  Does something  That's the angle  It does something  Different to the brain  The brain reacts  Differently  When that behavior  Is being acted on  It also sounded like  A compulsion  Happens in your head  And drives you  To do things  And the addiction  Is a compulsion  With outside influence  Some type of  Outside influence  Alcohol  Gambling  Yeah  Things like that  You could have a compulsion  Without I guess anything  You know just be a compulsive  You know I want to 
[03:55:00]  Straighten the rug out  Right  Guy  Or the picture's crooked guy  But your withdrawal  Would be different probably  Yeah  Than if you stopped  Gambling  Because there's a real withdrawal  Yeah yeah  I mean I don't know again  But there's obviously  A medical difference  Between them  Because it is an odd question  How would gambling  Be the same as alcohol  If you don't drink gambling  Yeah  Getting back to the gambling thing  Jay in Tennessee  Has a really good observation  Jay what's up  Hey how's it going guys  Hey man Jay  Listen  Isn't a  You know  Isn't a casino  Kind of liable  Much like a 
[03:55:30]  You know  A bar would be liable  For you  If you got drunk  And went out  We had a case here  In Tennessee  Last year  Where a guy  Got served too much  By a bartender  The bartender  Knew he was drunk  Sent him out  On the road  He went and  T-boned some teenager  And killed the two teenagers  In the car  Then the guy  Turns around  And sues the bar  For a million bucks  Wins his lawsuit  Because they said  That the bartender  Should notice  When the guy  Is drunk enough  And when he  Should be cut off  You know  I mean  Shouldn't  If they've got  All the surveillance  And everything  In these  Casinos  Don't they have 
[03:56:00]  The same liability  That a bar would  That's a really  Interesting question  Man  I don't  I don't think so  Because even though  It's the same addiction  The immediacy  Of the consequences  I think is a little  Different  And the  And the  And the  Fucking level  Of the consequences  You're not gonna  Leave a casino  And drunk drive  And kill a family  I mean  Unless you're drinking  But you're not  Just gonna leave  You're gonna destroy  Your own family though  Yes you can  But I just think  That the bottom line  Is I think the bar reaction  Is a reaction 
[03:56:30]  Because people are dying  But it is interesting  They know who the  Compulsive gamblers are  Absolutely  But they also know  The amount of money  That these casinos  Bring in  They're not gonna  Fuck with that  Are you kidding me  What politician  Is gonna take that one on  But they'll go after  The easy targets  Once again  It's also very vague  Like with alcohol  You could blow into  The breathalyzer  And go you know  You were obviously  Too drunk to drive  The bartender  Didn't realize it  With gambling  It's very vague  As to say  This person  Is  Showing 
[03:57:00]  Addictive behavior  When  Like Jim brought up  Before  If they have a stack  Of chips in front of them  And they're winning  Would the casino  Be liable  Because they're  Addicted  Or  Compulsive  About gambling  As much as they would  If somebody lost everything  I really think  It's also  The consequences  Are so severe  I think that's why  Society has said  Yeah maybe it is  The same addiction  But the consequences  Are that people 
[03:57:30]  Are drunk driving  And they're killing  Thousands of people  A year  You know what I mean  I think with gambling  It's like well  There's no danger  Or not  Of you gonna go out  And kill people  Yeah this immediate  Right after you  Yeah  Gamble away everything  Your  Gambling has caused  A shitload of problems  A million things have  Holy crap  You're right  But  That's true  Gambling  Their weeks  Pay away  People being dead though  Immediate  Absolute  Unquestionably  Direct result  So they're  They're compulsive 
[03:58:00]  Shoppers  They're women  And guys too  That are compulsive  Shoppers  What are you supposed  To do  Sue the stores  Right right right  For that  I mean you could  You could really  Take this down  To the ridiculous  Yeah it's interesting  Let's say hi to Rob  On Long Island  Rob  Hey what's up guys  Hey  Yeah I'm 24  My father's a compulsive  Gamble  I've dealt with him  My whole life  When I was 8  My dad had a chance  To go to Arizona  To you know  Start  I drive a coffee truck  He drives a coffee truck  He had a chance to  You know do 
[03:58:30]  A couple routes out there  And I found out  We lived out there  Four years  I found out later on  Like maybe  When I was  Late teenage  I found out that  We moved out there  Because he owed a guy  $20,000  And we had to get away  You know  And he's on this  My entire life  When I was 16  He went to AC  He called me up  Ecstatic  That he was up like  10 grand  Playing blackjack  He said that  He was taking all of us  To Disney World  He comes back  Two days later  With $500  He lost it all 
[03:59:00]  You know  My wedding day  I got married  A year and a half ago  He was crying  At my wedding  I'm thinking  He's so happy for me  He was crying  Because he gave me  An empty envelope  Because he had no money  To give me  Oh  Yeah  You know  You know  When I started working  I do well for myself  I'm 24  I have a wife  I have a kid  You know  I'm able to  You know  Have a family  At this age  But yet  Since I do well  He knows that 
[03:59:30]  When he's in a bind  He can come to me  Right  To try to get money  And I do  You know  I've screamed  At the top of my lungs  But he's my father  So  You know  When I see him  Start to like  You know  Get teary eyed  Saying that somebody's  Going to punch him  In the face  I have to give him money  And he knows  That  He can  That he can just  Like run over me  And it's  It's something that  I've tried my whole life  To stop  But  You know  It'll never  Cut him off  If he stops going 
[04:00:00]  To OTB  He'll just play scratch offs  He'll play like  Quick picks  Not even good gambling?  Jesus Christ  Well  No  Well  I mean yeah  He's won  He'll go to OTB  He'll win a couple grand  But  Like if he went to OTB  And won like  Five thousand dollars  Instead of paying off  You know  Peter or Paulie  Or whatever  He'll go to  AC and play blackjack  Kind of sucks  Kind of sucks  You can't trade in your parents  You know  His money  It's amazing  Because anyone else  Anyone else in your life  That puts you through hell 
[04:00:30]  Like some of these parents out there  You would just  Blow off that person  And move on  But unfortunately  Because you got the  Parent son connection  Yeah  You're stuck with that crap  For the entire lifespan  Of a parent  You know  And his money management  Is horrible  If he lost like 200  He'd have to  He'd lose another thousand  Trying to win the 200  That he lost  Sure  And that's just  You know  And that's just the nature  Of the beef  You know  Alright sir  Alright guys  Thank you man  No problem  Very interesting  Let's do some line of the day
