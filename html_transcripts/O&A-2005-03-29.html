<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Jim Norton delivering a vehemently negative review of M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village," criticizing the acting (specifically Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sigourney Weaver, and William Hurt), plot, and twist ending.  Callers weighed in, sparking debate.  The segment included a brief, vague story about Opie's dog, Chester, suffering a liver injury, and a humorous anecdote about Opie's low blood sugar and desperate search for milk.  It concluded with a listener-submitted rhyme about Anthony.

Next, the hosts introduced a recurring joke, "Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. Here comes Professor Anthony," and then discussed a listener, "Stalker Patty," who conducted a flawed physics experiment on falling objects, misunderstanding the effects of air resistance.  This segued into a discussion of gravity and air resistance.

A substantial portion focused on a darkly humorous and offensive segment: "The Diary of an Unborn Fetus," featuring inappropriate diary entries and a song, "Why Did My Mommy Kill Me?".

The show then shifted to mocking Don Geronimo’s reaction to accidentally killing his dog, Rudy.  They played audio of Geronimo’s on-air distress, his wife's online eulogy, and listener reactions, including a caller's mocking question about the dead dog's value.  Offensive language was heavily used throughout this segment.  They also discussed a caller whose number was published on Don and Mike's website.  This transitioned into a segment heavily mocking Don Imus's reaction to the death of his dog, Rudy,  using similarly offensive language and jokes. The hosts peppered the discussion with prank call audio and the sarcastic catchphrase "bingo."  This section included a lengthy, graphic discussion of Opie's visit to the doctor for constipation, replete with vulgar descriptions of the rectal examination.  They also graphically detailed a colleague's, Ben's, illness from bad sushi.  No in-studio guests were present during this extended segment.


The show continued with a discussion about the supposed sexual motivations of gynecologists and proctologists, fueled by speculation about their patient demographics. Callers, including Karen (a gynecologist's office employee) and Lynn (an employee of a proctology group), offered counterpoints.  A male caller shared graphic anecdotes from his gynecologist father.  Opie then described his own recent physical, highlighting the doctor's excessive glove use and an allegedly unnecessary stool sample.  This led to more crude medical examination humor.  This transitioned into a discussion about a 51-year-old man who murdered his wife after years of nagging, prompting discussions about marital strife and nagging.  Opie shared his experiences, and callers contributed their own stories.  One caller even admitted to killing his first wife to avoid his second wife’s nagging.


A phone call with John, a man claiming to have killed his wife on acid after an argument and then serving 15 years for it, followed.  He stated he did it to avoid child support and that his current wife knew about the crime beforehand. The hosts expressed skepticism and planned further investigation.  The call was interrupted by technical difficulties, which, along with more technical issues, concluded the segment, before promoting an upcoming Opie and Anthony live event in Boston.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen. 
[00:04:00]  Some people are really fucking stupid.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn.  All right.  One other thing from Jim Norton before we move on here.  You just came in with the Village DVD and you're just completely outraged.  He was livid when he came in.  He's holding it up.  He was speechless.  He just holds it up so he can look at it.  And he's just like, this.  You notice what time he came here, too?  Yeah.  Like 5.20.  We're like, what's wrong?  You have a fever or something?  Been up all night. 
[00:04:30]  But he walks in with the DVD just in his hand.  It's not even in his bag or whatever.  Well, he doesn't have any of that stuff.  He just throws a coat on and comes in here.  Why?  Never mind.  But he's holding the DVD and he's just ranting and raving about it.  Yeah.  In a bad way.  In Chicago.  And I'm tempted to get on a plane and go get a refund.  This piece of crap could be the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  I actually at one point thought that this M. Night Shyamalan, whatever. 
[00:05:00]  Shyamalan, ding dong.  Exactly.  It was awful.  I thought this might be a comedy.  I'm like, this can't be serious.  The acting was atrocious.  Atrocious.  The story was atrocious.  The village.  I would have liked this more if it was about Greenwich Village.  And instead of red cloaks, they all wear chaps and drank out of each other's mules.  Everything you've done.  Freshly bleached hair.  Yeah, story.  I was going to say, story.  Martini Steve. 
[00:05:30]  Bunch of cozy creatures in the woods in the village.  They're not monsters.  They're bears.  They just hug you if you cross the magic line.  Beware the sweet face.  It was not a horror film.  I thought the acting was good.  The acting was atrocious.  Now, looking at the commercials for it, it was presented like some type of horror film in the same vein as, what was the other movie you put out?  Six Sands.  Which was great.  No, Sands. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And Sands.  He put out Sands.  So, I was thinking it was going to be like that.  I have not seen this movie.  Oh.  Don't worry.  You could ruin it for me.  I don't care.  I won't ruin it for you, but I'll tell you who will.  Joaquin Phoenix, whose next film should be called Breakdancing in Front of the Viper.  Awful.  You didn't like his acting when the retarded character in the film stabbed him?  That was the old.  No, I actually liked when he got stabbed.  I didn't like the fact that he did live. 
[00:06:30]  The only part of the movie I liked is when Adrian Brody's face got slapped because a retard being slapped is always amusing.  Always amusing.  Sigourney Weaver stunk.  Now, you're saying the acting's horrible.  William Hurt.  But William Hurt's a great actor.  He was awful.  Sigourney Weaver is a very good actress.  She is, yeah.  I suppose so.  Star-studded cast, I might add.  It was amazing.  Didn't Brody win an Oscar?  He certainly did for the penis.  Yeah, the piano.  The pianist. 
[00:07:00]  The pianist was the pianist?  Yeah, the pianist.  The pianist.  Who else?  Who's the chick who's the last name?  Is Howard something Howard?  Yeah.  God, ripping me off, Robin.  Brianna, uh...  She was atrocious.  Whatever, yeah.  Really?  So the acting, horrific.  I thought it was a goof.  There's a clip here where this one woman is, like, thinking of proposing marriage to Joaquin Phoenix.  Yeah.  And I thought this was, like, meant to be a comedy.  I'm like, this has to be ironic.  She can't really be acting. 
[00:07:30]  So she gets up all the courage and she walks up to him.  It's supposed to be, like, this 1800s setting.  Yeah.  And he's, like, uh, he's sharpening a sword.  And, uh, if you got the first clip, this is what she says.  This is her, like, telling him that she loves him.  Good afternoon, Lucius.  I wanted to...  to tell you something.  I love you, Lucius.  I love you like the day is long. 
[00:08:00]  I love you more than the sun and the moon together.  And if you feel the same way, then we should not hide it any longer.  It's a gift, love is.  We should be thankful.  We should bellow it out with all the breath in our lungs.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  That's the next scene after he, like, doesn't react.  That's her crying.  I just wanted that in there because that's how I felt watching this film.  Do you realize that...  Wow, that acting is really bad.  It's like listening to Blair's cousin Jerry do Shakespeare.  It's horrible.  That's Bryce Dallas Howard.  Oh.  Dude.  Ron's daughter.  That is Ron's daughter.  It is?  I'm like, it has to be his daughter for her to get acting work.  She is atrocious.  Well, the reviewers, I remember at the time, thought she did a fantastic job with this movie. 
[00:09:00]  Really?  Yeah, that's what I'm, you know, just saying.  Now, it's not a horror movie by any stretch of the imagination?  Well, they definitely marketed it as a horror flick.  Yes, they did.  And when I saw it, when the credits, you know, started rolling, everyone got really pissed off.  People started throwing some of their refreshments going, that's it?  Really?  That's it?  That's it?  One of those movies that ends and you're like, oh, no, don't you dare roll the credits.  Yeah, this is BS.  That's it?  I actually, I also had Steve, uh, Joaquin Phoenix has this thing he does. 
[00:09:30]  Um, he's, he's on the same, like, success path as, you know, Jim Belushi, or name someone  else who had a more gifted brother kick the bucket at a young age.  Um.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And, uh, he does this thing where he whispers, because, uh, he really is not a good actor,  so to get emotion, he whispers.  And that's his way of, uh, being passionate.  Is, uh, he whispers.  And, uh, it's enragingly bad.  Because I don't know why actors somehow think that, that makes you seem passionate.  Really? 
[00:10:00]  It doesn't, it makes you seem hoarse.  It's awful.  So I have a thing of him and Bryce.  Okay.  I think this is Bryce or the other thing back.  This is Joaquin's monologue, I believe.  I love this Jimmy's review.  It's just him and her talking, and, uh, she says something, and this is, he's passionate.  When we are married, will you dance with me?  I find dancing very agreeable.  Why can you not say what is in your head? 
[00:10:30]  Why can you not stop saying what is in yours?  Why must you lead when I want to lead?  If I want to dance, I will ask you to dance.  If I want to speak, I will open my mouth and speak.  I'm the one that's forever plaguing me to speak, friend.  I will get to the watch your choices. 
[00:11:00]  He does do that in a lot of roles.  Here's why.  He stinks.  Oh, Joaquin.  Anybody with a silent J in the beginning of their name is going to stink.  Yeah.  That wasn't his thing, though.  Opie, how do you find your coffee?  Is it good?  It's very good.  How many splinters do you put in it?  One. 
[00:11:30]  I can't believe it.  One.  And M. Night should be, he really should be gutted for writing this dialogue.  But she says to him, on our wedding night, will you dance with me?  I find dancing to be agreeable.  How do you go through a read-through with a bunch of actors and she says that and somebody doesn't throw hot coffee at her?  How does that happen?  I swear to God.  Because they're all agreeable in Hollywood.  I was teetering, thinking that this might be some kind of an ironic parody of horrible acting. 
[00:12:00]  Really?  Atrocious.  William Hurt is a good actor and he stinks in it.  Nobody was good.  I didn't get any Sigourney stuff.  I believe I can go back through it and have some later this week.  She also was atrocious.  Now, what is it about the story that is so bad?  Well, what's happening in the film, and I won't give it away, is that there are, it's a village.  I kind of like the idea.  Yeah.  Well, that's a wee part company. 
[00:12:30]  I have no idea what it's about.  It's people like, it's like an 1800 setting.  Right.  And they live in this little village and they're walled off from the forest.  They don't go into the forest and the creatures, who apparently are acting coaches, don't come into their village.  The creatures stay in the forest and red is the bad color.  Don't go into the forest.  Don't go into the forest.  You know, don't go into the forest or anywhere near the Golden Globes.  So, they stay in the village.  And of course you're going to have that overachiever that has to go in the forest. 
[00:13:00]  Of course.  Yes.  That's the bad part of the movie.  So far, nothing bad.  Yeah, but you know somebody that knows nothing about this.  That's what I hate about Hollywood.  You watch these movies like, oh, let me guess, there's going to be an overachiever that has to push the limits of the village and has to go see what's out there.  Well, because this is such an original concept, there is a council of elders, which was just such a conceptually brilliant thing for a film.  And at one point, I don't want to give anything away, Joaquin Phoenix is stabbed by a retard, Adrian Brody, stabs him when he finds out that Joaquin is going to marry the girl that he likes, who's blind, by the way. 
[00:13:30]  Not the one who said, I love you, we should shout it.  Not that one.  No.  But the one who said, I would like to dance.  Dancing is agreeable.  I guess because you'll never drive, whore, because you're blind.  She's the one who...  And it's the 1800s.  Yeah, that was a good point.  Well, but it's not the 1800s, Anthony. 
[00:14:00]  Whoops!  Oh, no!  Oh, Jesus!  Oh, no, no, no.  You wrecked it!  Oh, oh, oh, wow, all right, now that's kind of a cool twist.  Wait, it's not a cool twist.  No?  It stinks.  It's not?  There's one part where the girl wants to go into the towns for the medicine.  I've got to recover from this!  That is a complete ruin of the movie!  They have to go into the town to get medicine for Joaquin or he's going to die.  For Joaquin, Phoenix is going to die.  Because, see, they're living like it's the 1800s.  Of course.  But his injury is such that there's medicine that they have to get from the town. 
[00:14:30]  The town.  Yeah.  So, she's preparing to go into the woods.  The blind girl is going to walk through the woods to the town.  She's the best choice.  Are you kidding me?  And William Hurt gives a speech to the other elders because they're like, look, you're risking  what we built here, this private thing, by sending her into the town where she may,  you know, run into Sanford Meisner.  So, this is exactly what's going on.  And William Hurt, I took some of his monologue to the other elders. 
[00:15:00]  The elders.  And this is his bit of overacting atrocity.  Right?  Who do you think will continue this place, this life?  Do you plan to live forever?  It is in them that our future lies.  It is in Ivy and Lucius that this way of life will continue.  Yes, I have risked.  I hope I am always able to risk everything for the just and right cause.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  That makes my skin crawl.  And, again, I can't blow the ending, but the fact is that the whole movie, you think it's  the 1800s, and then she crosses a fence and sees a park ranger, and you do realize that  they're living in modern times.  And, by the way, there are no creatures.  They're just red suits that the elders keep.  There's no creatures.  No creatures.  The elders have these red creature suits.  And every once in a while, they throw them on just to scare them.  And go into the woods and come out of the woods?  Well, sometimes they come into the actual village.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Scare them a little bit just to keep them under control.  Uh-huh.  The elders are all...  Hence, religion and fear in society, everybody.  Yes.  Hence, religion and fear in society.  He had a message.  It certainly wasn't good film writing.  Hey, do the elders know about the...  About the...  What times they're living in?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They were all...  Oh, here's the thing.  The elders, no.  The elders were all crime victims in real life, so they decided to build this peaceful,  crime-y place.  This perfect society.  Perfect society.  But what we learn is even a perfect society has a problem.  Right.  And in this case, it was the retard guy. 
[00:16:30]  The writing and the directing, yeah.  Yeah.  So, I hope any of you that thought of going out to buy this DVD, I hope I ruined it for  you.  There's no creatures.  There might be two scary moments.  The most horrifying part is when the credits roll and you realize you got suckered in to  buying this piece of garbage.  It is horrendous.  Everything he's done since the sixth sense has gotten progressively worse.  But he's making a statement about religion and how religion controls a society and how  fear controls a society from free thinking. 
[00:17:00]  Here's a statement about religion he's making.  You can strap this film to your waist and run onto a bus in Tel Aviv.  It is horrendous.  The village stunk.  Now, if you ask me, not having seen the movie, but now having been told the plot and everything,  it sounds like a Twilight Zone.  Sounds like it could be a Twilight Zone episode.  But terribly done and the writing was so weak and the story was so weak.  Had they thrown that twist at the end and it was well acted and well done and scary? 
[00:17:30]  It might have been like, whoa.  Look, on the outside, not having seen the movie, it sounds like a good idea.  It was a good idea.  It actually sounds like a good idea for a movie.  Right.  Atrocious.  I was livid when I was...  Do you understand?  I went to go to bed last night.  I took cough medicine.  That makes me sleepy.  Instead, I said, let me whack my bag one time and then watch this.  And I couldn't sleep.  I was so aggravated.  Wow.  And I think the final...  One of the final lines of the movie was, my darling, my blood. 
[00:18:00]  No.  I don't know what that is either.  And then...  No?  No.  Wrong film.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's the end of another film.  I really hope that somebody out there was planning on buying this DVD and it's ruined for you.  Really fast because a couple people wanted to defend the movie.  Oh, yeah?  Jimmy.  Eric from Nebraska.  Eric?  Of course. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, Nebraska?  Well, you know, I've been listening to your show since October.  Love the show, you know, but...  I hate the show myself, but thank you.  I'll tell you, Jimmy, maybe you should go out and get a hooker because you should be in a really pissed off mood this morning.  The Village is an awesome movie.  Listen, first of all, you live in Nebraska.  You just like it because with the 1800s, that looked like futuristic and modern to what you're used to out there.  The movie stunk. 
[00:19:00]  Someone doesn't like wide open spaces, eh?  I love wide open spaces.  Eric, what did you like about the movie?  Well, you know, I've watched all of M. Night Shyamalan's work, and he's a hell of a writer in the sense that he will drag you one way and then give you that plot twist at the end.  Yeah, like everybody else in Hollywood does now.  You go left, you go right, and there's the guy in the middle with no money going,  Hey, what do you want from me?  It stinks.  It looks familiar.  You know, not everybody can be wrong, and, you know, you're a hell of a comedian, but apparently you don't know shit about acting.  I know a lot about acting, and I know awful acting. 
[00:19:30]  Believe me, I like good actors.  I'm disgusted that Jamie Foxx didn't win Best Actor, the only one who won Best Actor for a Musical Comedy.  I know a lot about acting.  You've come back.  And every once in a while, Hollywood will surprise you and throw you a twist,  because I really thought that Morgan Freeman was going to be the one that died.  Well, you know.  Now I know.  I just want to listen to the movie a little bit here and say hello to you guys.  Dude.  Maybe my words ain't worth much, and that's fine.  Dude, the village was atrocious. 
[00:20:00]  The twist, it cheated.  The story was so weak and all over the place and boring.  This cornball love story between that dullard Joaquin Phoenix and this stupid blind broad who walks through the woods.  And then Adrienne Brody at the end escapes because he tried to kill somebody, and then he puts on the red monster suit.  And she stands in front of an open hole and then steps away at the right moment.  And Adrienne Brody runs and falls and dies in the hole.  The blind girl found the hole in the woods and knew to step away. 
[00:20:30]  So the retard in the monster costume and this idiot from Nebraska is clawing up like it's Citizen Kane.  It's stunk.  All right.  Bob from Jacksonville wants to defend the village as well.  Go ahead, Bob.  Morning, shit, Dix.  How you doing, man?  Home of the Super Bowl.  Hey, Jimmy.  Stick the comedy, man.  I thought the movie, it was a little frustrating through the middle of it, and toward the end it just all came together, man.  I love that movie.  Yeah, but you know what it seems like to me?  Again, not having seen the movie, it seems like a story like that where the end is the big twist. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  That you've got to then fill up the entire movie with some type of story.  Like, you could have, all right, it's the 1800s, Monsters in the Woods, at the end we're going to show you it's not the 1800s, and go.  Now you've got to fill it up with, what, a crappy love story was in there?  See, the whole thing was, here's what he was trying to do.  Here's what he was trying to do.  He was rushing.  He thought he had this brilliant plot twist and this amazing ending. 
[00:21:30]  So the whole film was basically built to try to justify this thing he probably envisioned, and it was crap.  When you look at The Sixth Sense, that was, to me, great.  It was a great movie, it was well written, it was believable, it caught me off guard, it blew me away.  This was crap.  I wanted to be blown away, and it made me physically ill.  It could have been a half hour Twilight Zone.  Dude, it was, the Twilight Zone would have done it better.  They would have done it right.  They would have known how to act.  All right, let's go to Chris in New York.  Chris, go ahead. 
[00:22:00]  How you doing?  Hey, good, man.  I went to the movie over the weekend, actually I bought it.  One of my friends recommended it to me, and after I was done watching it, I drove by his house and threw it out his window.  Thank you.  Dude, I bought it too, I'm so aggravated.  That's hilarious.  Let's go to Johnny B on Long Island.  Johnny B.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Johnny B.  Hi, Cuddle Bunny.  Hi, Johnny B.  Jimmy, I've got to defend you 100%.  I have never been to a movie where everybody in the movie theater for opening night said, 
[00:22:30]  Wow, that sucked.  Yeah, that's what I got when I went.  Everyone was around me going, I can't, what?  That's it?  I've got to see it just to see how bad it is.  Alone in my DVD.  Don't waste your time, don't waste your time.  And don't even bother.  What do you think about seeing Napoleon Dynamite?  Don't.  Don't.  I saw Napoleon Dynamite.  You like?  It was really weird, but it's funny.  It's funny.  It's a goofy movie.  It doesn't really have a real story to it, but the characters are kind of funny enough  that it carries it. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think if you watched it a few times, it's one of those movies that if you watch a few  times, you'll get certain parts of it that really make you laugh.  Yeah.  Trevor in Jersey.  Trevor?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  The retard's parents, crying at the end, after they found out he was dead, made up  the whole rest of the movie for me.  I thought that made the whole movie.  Why?  Was it funny?  Yeah.  You didn't laugh your ass off?  I'm trying to remember.  That Ivy killed a monster in the woods, and the parents just started crying their eyes  out? 
[00:23:30]  Well, yeah, because they knew it was the retard, but by that point, dude, I was crying with  them because I had sat through it.  It was horrible.  How did they get around?  How did they get around?  Things like airplanes and stuff.  Oh, they tried to cover that.  There's a scene.  This arrogant ass put himself in a scene because he thinks he's Hitchcock.  Yeah, he put himself in a giant also.  I forgot.  Yeah, he has to be in all his movies.  That's right.  And after they realized that it's actually modern times, one of the park rangers is  talking to his boss, and he's going like, hey, man, look, you're only there to guard  the preserve.  It's some kind of wildlife preserve that we're a couple miles in, and we pay the planes off 
[00:24:00]  not to fly over.  It was like the cheapest tie-in.  Way out.  Yeah, dude, it was such a cheap, like, let's tie this loose end without any real thought  into it.  Yeah.  It stunk.  And the village itself, how big was it about?  Oh, a few houses.  Five or six houses.  Five or six houses.  Yeah, a little village.  So it could have been in there without being detected.  Red was the bad color.  Apparently, the entire script was written in it.  How many years have they been there? 
[00:24:30]  Well, I guess the people who starred out, you have to assume these adult children have  been there since childhood or whatever, or adulthood.  Maybe 20 years.  20 years.  20 years.  The elders came in 20 years.  The elders.  The elders.  All right, one more.  James from Connecticut, then we'll move on.  Go ahead, James.  Yeah, I agree with you, little Jimmy.  That movie sucked.  Sucked.  My wife bought it, and it made a big thing about it.  We're sitting in front of the TV surround sound.  The best part was when she fell in that hole.  Yeah.  It sucked. 
[00:25:00]  Dude, I was so mad, I wanted to throw myself in front of a train.  Oh, to compare it to the Twilight Zone.  Oh, you just killed the Twilight Zone.  That was way better.  Hey, did you see?  I'll tell you what blew me away that I absolutely loved and I thought was going to be overrated.  I saw Ray, and I thought that was phenomenal.  I didn't expect to like it.  I'm like, ah, this will probably be blown out of proportion, but it was great, man.  It was horrible, but I agree with you.  Does he die at the end?  All right, thanks, buddy.  No, but he actually, he actually like wings and says, I can see. 
[00:25:30]  You know, I'm trying to move on.  Another Hollywood twist.  Yeah.  I'm trying to move on, but there's one more here.  Let's say hi to Eric.  Go ahead, Eric.  Oh, hi, ONA.  Love the show.  How you doing, Cuddle Bunny?  Hey, what's up, Eric?  I was just calling because the one major plot point that nobody's mentioned so far in that  movie that sucked were those boxes of doom that were in every one of the elders' houses.  Oh, yeah.  The boxes of doom.  The boxes were not hidden.  They were not put out of sight.  They were right in the middle of everybody's living room. 
[00:26:00]  What is it?  Well, there were boxes of newspaper clippings from their old lives, like boxes of, you know,  the atrocities that happened to each elder.  Like in real life, every one of them had a loved one murdered or something, and that's  why they all banded together and created this little place where there was no crime or real  acting or any type of directing or writing.  This little magical place where any twist you throw in is going to wrap the audience  up into a new little package.  Jim, their own nirvana.  Their own nirvana.  Excellent point. 
[00:26:30]  They had these boxes out in plain sight, and it was just horrible because nobody even looked  in the boxes.  Yeah.  And they kept everything.  All right.  Anyway, the movie sucked.  I'm punching out.  It was just awful.  And the monster costumes were horrible.  Yeah.  What were they?  Well, it was like a red cloak because, you know, monsters have red cloaks and a big dumb  monster face, and it looked like it had thin branches coming out of its back.  It was corny and awful.  I saw more believable monsters on Davy and Goliath.  They were scarier as claymation than these awful monsters were. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We get the point.  A review of the village.  The book states that Shyamalan and Ding Dong lifted the surprise ending almost directly  from 100 yards over the rim, an episode of The Twilight Zone starring Cliff Robertson  that originally aired in 61.  I remember that one.  A ship goes up into space, the astronauts kill each other off, or at least one of them  is really crazed and killing the other ones off to get their water and supplies so he could 
[00:27:30]  live a little longer.  And they're looking for any type of stuff to keep them alive, water, a lake, something.  And one guy climbs over the rim, looks down, and sees a telephone pole and a road and realizes  they had crashed back on Earth and they weren't on a distant planet.  So, kind of similar twist.  Yeah.  If you're going to put a twist at the end, just make it believable.  Make sure...  Stephen King talked about it in Misery, where Kathy Bates' biggest complaint in the book 
[00:28:00]  was that he cheated on one of the books.  Oh, yeah.  He cut to a different point without the logical progression.  That's what this did.  So, you're saying he should be hobbled?  I absolutely believe that.  I hope that M. Nightshall faces a hummel in the wrong direction.  Because, actually, in the book...  In the book, Stephen King is good.  In the book, he wasn't hobbled.  She took a hatchet and chopped his foot off and then blowtorched the wound.  And she also cut off one of his fingers and put it in a birthday cake. 
[00:28:30]  And the book was great.  Much better.  Wonderful.  All right.  That should happen to him.  Except it should be his writing hand put in a cake.  So, next time he tries to type a twist.  You're a dumb Indian and your movie stunk.  Ugh.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  And do we have time to talk about the movie you saw in the hotel room that you really,  really enjoyed?  I enjoyed it.  We started this late in the show yesterday.  Yeah.  I enjoyed this movie.  I watched it on the hotel, you know, movie thing.  It was a good movie. 
[00:29:00]  I think if I didn't know the end, I would have really enjoyed it.  But even not knowing the end as it went on.  And I was trying not to like it because other people were saying it was a bad movie.  So, when certain parts came up and I was laughing, and then I realized, why am I laughing?  This is kind of a good movie.  It was called The Village.  I watched The Village.  Norton's giving you a look.  Anthony liked The Village.  Jimmy.  The movie you trashed about a week and a half ago on the program. 
[00:29:30]  I watched The Village.  And I, if I didn't know the end, I probably would have been like, oh my God, this movie  is fantastic.  But since I knew the end, I just, I was like, well, there is nothing wrong with this movie.  It is a good movie.  I thought, okay, the acting wasn't all that hot.  But the story, how it was presented, I had no problem with it.  And then there was one part where Joaquin is doing that thing we've all been goofing on. 
[00:30:00]  I hadn't seen the movie, so I too was goofing on it.  The whispering thing.  Where he's, Jimmy says that he's such a bad actor that instead of being dramatic or intense,  he just whispers.  Yeah.  Isn't this a lie?  Why do I have to whisper?  Because I stink.  So I'm laughing when he's whispering.  This scene comes up and he's whispering.  I'm like, ah, what a tool.  I got my rah-rah-go-Jimmy banner in one hand, my Jimmy this movie sucks hat on my head, and 
[00:30:30]  I'm laughing at everything.  And then I'm realizing, wait a minute, he's whispering because he's on a porch and people  are sleeping in the house inside.  I know.  I understood the reason for it.  I knew why in the scene he was whispering.  Okay.  But I'm talking about when somebody is expressing passion and the only way they can do it, he's  not doing it like that.  It was just, it was atrocious.  I didn't see him expressing passion that way.  I saw him whispering on the porch and I saw him whispering when he was trying to put a 
[00:31:00]  point across that maybe wasn't going to be accepted around people.  And it was kind of like he had to keep it to himself a little bit that he wanted to do  certain things.  And then he would go into that whisper thing.  I did get a good chuckle over it.  What was it that he had wanted to do that he wanted to finally take an acting class?  That when they're sitting on the porch and that cornball dialogue and she's going, he's  going, why can't you never speak things that are on your mind?  Why must you always speak with him?  It was horrendously written.  It was even more poorly acted. 
[00:31:30]  It was terrible.  I wanted to love that movie when I saw it, dude.  I wanted to love it.  I like him.  I thought because it was a period piece, which it was.  Yeah, I think bloody stain on the front of the dress.  That's exactly what it was.  It stunk like copper and mushrooms.  I didn't see it that way.  I saw it as a period piece, which kind of was why the acting, I think, was like that,  why it was presented like that.  I don't know if the acting was so bad or if it was just that's, you know, it's supposed 
[00:32:00]  to be kind of 1800s-ish.  It was.  But have you ever seen Anthony Hopkins do 1800s?  Have you ever seen Gary Oldman do 1800s?  They're guys that can act.  If you're going to do 1800s, do 1800s.  But if you can't do 1800s, there's nothing worse than, why am I talking about it?  It was just terrible.  Okay.  It was terrible.  Didn't you find it a little weird when the blind girl had to go to the village or whatever  to the town or whatever it was to get the medicine? 
[00:32:30]  I did find that a little weird, but she did seem to have a certain perception that was  above and beyond your normal blind person.  And also...  But she wouldn't be the first choice to go heading out into the woods.  No, it obviously is the first choice because she was the one that could have gone without  seeing things and taking it back and saying, I saw a motor vehicle.  Good point.  I saw these wonderful things.  So she obviously was the best person suited to go.  Well, because she wouldn't come back with the info.  But meanwhile, they're sending a blind chick into the woods because they're all crime victims 
[00:33:00]  and they're worried about their families.  So what do you do?  Even though you know that there's no monsters, you just send the blind girl aimlessly into  the woods somewhere and hope she finds the road and doesn't realize that there's a car  picking her up and then just makes her way back over a fence.  It's stunk and he should be gutted for it.  Everything...  Dude, everything...  I didn't find it that bad.  And why didn't one of the guys that knew the whole scam go for the medicine?  Absolutely.  One of the elders?  One of the elders that knew what this whole village was about.  I know why.  That's a good idea.  Why? 
[00:33:30]  Because he was too scared?  No, they were just too heartbroken what had happened in the world so they couldn't bear  to face it.  So meanwhile, send the blind girl through the woods at three o'clock in the morning.  She won't trip on anything and catch her neck in a branch.  It was terrible.  She had to go because she was in love with the Joaquin and she was the one.  And he had been stabbed by Adrian Brody who should stab himself after winning the Oscar  and then performing in that hunk of shit. 
[00:34:00]  Did the little wacky costumes didn't throw you that actual almost adult teenagers were  scared by the wacky costumes?  Some douchey elder yelling boogaloo.  Did they actually say boogaloo?  No.  What about the sound down?  Had they yelled boogaloo, it would have added more integrity to the monster character.  He's beating you up pretty good, Anthony.  I understand.  He's beating you up pretty good.  I didn't find it that bad.  I didn't mind the movie.  I thought it was kind of a, he had a little message in there about how today it's better 
[00:34:30]  to keep your society in fear of something to keep them in control.  That was not his message.  His message was, your first film is always your best and it's downhill after that.  That was his message.  I understood he's trying to put a message in, but that annoyed me in a way.  If a social message is organically inserted into a film and it makes sense, but when it's  done, it's too cute or it's too forced, it insults my intelligence and it makes me very  angry.  I thought, it makes me very angry.  I thought it was not a bad movie at all. 
[00:35:00]  And I thought the double twist thing, you thought you had the twist when you realized the elders  were the ones that were dressed in as the monster, but the twist is that they weren't.  Do we have any acting clips from that?  They weren't.  Maybe now that you've seen it, you can even look at it in context.  Any acting clips?  We don't have that?  We'll have to go back to the acting clips when we get to New York tomorrow.  The O.P. and Anthony.  Say, Jim, what's real?  The worst of O.P. and Anthony.  There's some sexual reference.  Hey, Bill.  Hello.  Man, the phones are really slow today.  A little low, too, right? 
[00:35:30]  Oh, a little low.  Go ahead, Bill.  Morning, O.N.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Bill.  I just want to say, the satellite radio thing is rocking, man.  Someone told me in a bar last night, like, well, we heard Howard had some points, so  I'm like, dude, O.N.  A had a woman on the air live, like, giving a blowjob to someone.  Yeah, well, that's for our sexiest state in America contest, and Ohio has let us down  so far today, although they brought us Melanie today, which is cool, but there was a guy  that was waking his wife up to have some sex, and I don't know, he hung up on us.  I don't think the wife was into it. 
[00:36:00]  Going to be hard to beat Illinois.  Illinois, yeah, Illinois is in the lead so far, but go ahead, Bill.  All right, man, I got a quick story.  Despite what one Norton told me last year with Voss, where they had a girl in between  them.  Which one?  Do we have, like, a bunch of those?  It was the ugly girl where you both were naked, she was in the middle, and you guys  were taking turns whacking off, I think that story.  Oh, and she, when Voss, Voss, uh, joked around with her, and he goes, all right, we'll  flip a coin, whoever loses has to fuck her.  He said that right...  No, not that one, not that one.  But Voss was like, oh, shut up. 
[00:36:30]  What kind of dog you got there?  Not even mine, I'm dog-sitting, I just got here, I don't even know what kind of dog...  Oh, give the little fella a little pet on his head, that'll quiet him down.  You know who quiets him down?  Opie will tell you this, you gotta kick it in the liver, and within weeks it'll be dead.  Right-o?  We're not telling that story yet.  Right-o?  We're not telling that story yet.  After it eats your steak?  We're not telling that story yet.  Right before the basketball game?  What did I do to you today?  What are you talking about?  Nothing, I think Opie might have a knowledge on how to get rid of the... 
[00:37:00]  I have no idea what you're talking about.  No?  No?  Look, man, the dog was old.  Maybe Wyatt shouldn't have been kicked in the liver.  I'm not ready to tell that story yet, Anthony.  Great.  Thanks to you, I had to carry that thing upstairs for the rest of its life of two weeks.  I don't know what to do.  I'm going to go take a break.  You get back here.  What did I do to you today? 
[00:37:30]  Nothing.  You brought in donuts.  I was very happy.  All right, good.  XM 202.  All right, here's the story of the day.  Canine used to subdue naked suspects.  Tuesday afternoon around 12.05, there was a man, a stark naked man, checking for unlocked doors.  Completely naked, going from home to home, right?  There you go.  He found one at Craig Martinson's home.  I know he scattered a bunch of laundry around.  I know he was on all floors.  What does that mean?  What is that, sweetie?  Either he was on all fours and they made a mistake, or he was on all the floors of this guy's house. 
[00:38:00]  Either way, it's a mistake, though.  Like if he was in the basement or the...  All right, so the guy broke into a home.  Maybe everywhere he walked was a floor.  The guy broke into a home.  He was stark naked, okay?  A half dozen cops were on the naked man's trail, including an officer with a canine named Zach.  The cops spotted the naked man inside this guy's home and ordered him outside.  At that point, the suspect leaped toward the canine officer and punched the canine officer in the head.  Bad move.  That is not a good move. 
[00:38:30]  Bad move.  These dogs are vicious.  Doing what the dog is trained to do, protect the handler, the dog jumped and bit the suspect in the genitals.  Ow!  In this case, the genitals, that's correct.  One neighbor says she watched as police appear to recover part of the man's testicles from the porch area of the home.  Oh, no!  The dog bit his balls right off him.  Just think you're a dog.  That dangling meat, it's a perfect target, and to rip a piece off for a dog is nothing. 
[00:39:00]  That's nothing.  It's just hanging there.  Minneapolis police say their canine officers are never trained to attack the genitals, but suspects usually aren't naked either, Anthony.  As the neighbor across the street told us, who happens to...  Council member what?  Scott Pent?  That doesn't make sense either.  Well, whatever.  This seems to be an incident without precedent.  It's highly unusual.  Don't have much criminal activity since I moved here 15 years ago. 
[00:39:30]  So, obviously, the neighbor has never seen a naked guy get his testicles bitten off by a canine dog.  Yeah.  That's basically what's going on there, right?  And the suspect is in serious, stable condition.  Police are investigating whether the suspect was on drugs.  I like this part.  Go ahead.  Even after the canine bit the suspect right in the junk, Minneapolis police say officers still tasered the suspect several times.  There you are.  You're bleeding sack because it was bitten off by a dog, and you get a little taser action, too. 
[00:40:00]  You're laying on the ground just hoping the dog doesn't swallow it.  Zach, the canine, has a clean record, but is off the street pending the outcome of an investigation.  Why? The dog was doing his job.  Well, now they'll probably have to shoot the dog, right?  Is that what we do in this society?  If I was the owner, I'd shoot him.  You're not going to go home and go,  Give me kisses.  Give me kisses, Zach. 
[00:40:30]  Licking it with man-testicle breath.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Mike.  Hey, uh, oh.  Yeah.  Hi, boys.  Listen, I actually read in the paper they're getting rid of the dog.  Oh, yeah?  And, yeah, the way they're doing it is they're actually sending him to Opie's house so Opie  can kick him in the liver.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I really don't know what he's talking about.  Chester.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Chester. 
[00:41:00]  Like I said, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Chester, where are you, Chester?  Shut up.  Chester.  Shut up.  Chester, where are you?  Shut up.  Chester, why are you limping like that?  Why is Chester boy limping?  This never happens.  Shut up.  As if someone kicked him in the liver.  Shut up.  We agreed.  We're not ready to tell that one yet.  We're not ready.  Not ready?  It's been ten years.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:41:30]  It's been ten years.  When will we be ready?  We're just not ready for that story.  Chester.  We're not ready for the Chester story.  Chester boy.  If I didn't know any better, Chester, I would swear somebody kicked you in the liver.  You know what?  I'm going to save myself here.  Chester has...  This will be the cliffhanger.  Chester has...  This will be the cliffhanger.  Shut up.  Chester has liver cancer.  The vet is saying it was caused by something. 
[00:42:00]  No, that's not true.  I believe it could have been a kick to the liver, but who in my house would kick my beautiful  Chester in the liver?  Who?  It's going to be the cliffhanger.  There are only a limited number of people that come into my apartment.  I can count them on one hand.  And I know none of them are mean enough to have kicked the little Chester in the liver.  Me! 
[00:42:30]  Me!  You don't know what happened.  I wasn't there.  I don't know what happened.  But based on...  Shut up!  We agreed.  Shut up!  Oh, Chester!  Where are you, Chester?  Chester looks a little run down these days.  Shut up.  Chester's not as pranky as he used to be.  This will be the cliffhanger.  Maybe we'll finally tell the Chester story on Monday.  Chester's not as pranky as he used to be. 
[00:43:00]  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester, you don't look the same happy, peppy pup as I remember from just yesterday.  Is there something bothering you, Chester?  Chester, why do you have a Nike print on your side? 
[00:43:30]  Shut up!  You just saved me, because I've never worn Nikes.  Oh, I made a mistake.  That's not a Nike logo.  I believe it's a Puma logo on your side.  Actually, this is so odd.  If I didn't know any better, I could swear that those are rollerblade prints on your side.  I know one person that rollerblades.  No, no, no. 
[00:44:00]  Now, who do I know that rollerblades?  Hmm.  Chester!  Chester's having problems coming up the stairs.  Dude, he's making all this up, Ben.  Don't look at me differently.  I wonder if this has anything to do with broken stuff around my house.  Shut up!  All the broken items that have just been sitting here for years and years and years. 
[00:44:30]  It's my mother-in-law's, my ex-mother-in-law's dog, Chester.  My mother-in-law.  Opie lived with my mother-in-law for a while.  Oh, just for a little while.  A little while.  Not too long, no.  When we moved to Massachusetts to do our show at AAF.  A mere couple years.  I know.  It was me and my ex-wife living with my mother-in-law.  I am so happy to have you kids living with me here in Ashland. 
[00:45:00]  This is wonderful.  And Opie's moving in also.  And I was like, in a second, we've got to get out of here.  Get an apartment.  I don't care.  We've got to get out.  Opie wound up living there forever.  Yeah.  You were there for so long, like months and months and months.  Just about a year.  Yeah, it was about a year.  He lived with my mother-in-law for a year.  Do you still keep in touch with her?  No.  Why would I?  It's my ex-mother-in-law.  You might have developed a friendship.  No.  No.  Nice enough woman, but why am I going to keep in touch with her? 
[00:45:30]  She gets to see...  I send her daughter pictures of Benjamin Franklin.  Lots of them.  Every three months.  So I think that's as close of a relationship as we have.  But Opie stayed there, and El Clutzo was constantly breaking stuff.  She had little knick-knacks and trinkets all over the place.  Dude.  And Opie would be on the phone, and the phone cord is swinging, hitting the hubbles.  She was the last person in America that had a cord on her phone.  I know.  And it was like 50 to 60 feet long, remember?  It was so long, so Opie would go out of the kitchen. 
[00:46:00]  No exaggeration.  This cord was 50 to 60 feet, and I like to pace when I'm on the phone.  Yeah.  And it looked like a big, tangled slinky when the phone was hung up because it was stretched  out and so tangled.  So Opie would be pulling this thing, and it's trailing this ball of coiled-up phone wire  that's swinging just like a wrecking ball.  It was almost like a tail, like a dog's tail.  Why are my Christmas hummels all broken?  I've had these for years and years and years.  I take perfect care of them. 
[00:46:30]  I don't understand.  I know Chester doesn't jump up where he would break them.  Why is Chester limping?  Why?  Dude.  Because Chester was fine yesterday.  I have no idea, right?  And now Chester...  I really have no idea.  Stop.  That's what Chester would do all the time.  Maybe if the dog didn't eat my prime rib dinner.  Ah, the devil. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  Devilish.  What?  What happened?  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  You must cast this demon out.  Anyway, that's a story for another time, Anthony.  I think I have to find out right now what happened to my little boy Chester.  He's since passed away and his ashes are in an urn in my living room.  But I don't understand. 
[00:47:30]  He seemed fine.  And then all of a sudden out of the clear blue, he all of a sudden developed a limp.  And he couldn't get up the stairs.  And Anthony had to come over and carry Chester up the fucking stairs every day.  Oh.  Every day.  Dude.  Thanks.  The dog was old.  Real old.  The dog was old.  He was real old.  And because he was old, I'm sure he didn't need any sudden shocks.  No, the dog was arthritic, obviously. 
[00:48:00]  He needed no sudden shocks to his little old body.  Like maybe a fall, because he's old.  Perhaps if something fell on him.  What did I do to you today?  What did I do to you today?  He could be hit by a cow or walk out and have the paper boy throw something and hit him.  Or perhaps being kicked in the side.  All right.  What kind of dog was Chester?  A lovable mutt. 
[00:48:30]  Aw.  Just a lovable mutt.  I had him since he was a little puppy.  Now he's gone.  My Chester.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  I understand I have problems.  Oh my God.  Trust me.  I know that.  Do you hear yourself?  Dude, what did I say before break?  What did I say?  I understand.  There's something that happens from time to time with me.  Matter of fact, it was a promo. 
[00:49:00]  Yep.  Because they forgot my potatoes.  Yes, your potatoes.  My blood sugar level drops and I start losing my mind.  I understand.  Dude, I just played a seven minute mash-up song.  Not for the stupid audience.  I could care less about them.  Half of them went to another channel for a while.  I threw that on so we could take a quick commercial break and I could get some food in my gullet.  Absolutely.  So I don't pass out.  I am not talking about the situation.  I wrote a note while we're discussing the stupid tsunami song that I could give a flying crap about, by the way, but I figured it would fill up 20 minutes of radio today. 
[00:49:30]  I wrote a note to Steve.  Steve, you know, SOS, I need milk immediately, meaning my blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  So that was literally five minutes before we went to break and then I'm noticing there is no milk around.  So I'm like, eh, I'm a professional DJ.  Find what's called filler.  So I'm like, make him believe I care that the Doors Blondie song is cool enough to play on the show. 
[00:50:00]  No, it was because it was the longest thing I could find, which was like six minutes long.  I'm like, hey, man, this is great.  Listen to this crap.  Thinking that the milk would arrive any second, I would get the cereal in my effing stomach and then I would be fine for the rest of the show.  I am not talking about the situation at hand.  I am talking about the fact that you sound like a madman.  And I understand.  I'm not saying I'm not with your milk. 
[00:50:30]  His only crime is he was pulling it from a Dwayne Reed bag.  Who the eff gets milk from Dwayne Reed?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  He unloads on him.  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  Because I need it right away.  I need it right away.  There's a deli right downstairs.  Is there not?  You sound crazy.  Is there a deli right downstairs?  There is absolutely.  A deli and I agree.  They should have gotten the milk from the deli.  We have a bunch of retards that should be strapping bombs on them and walking around in Iraq then working for us. 
[00:51:00]  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing how desperate I am right now?  How come when I walked in, I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  I don't know.  I know.  He yells it to me.  Where's my milk?  I have a line on the milk getting.  You don't understand.  My meters are like dropping fast.  It's called I go into a panic.  It's not that I'm a diva or any of that.  Why? 
[00:51:30]  This guy is very nice unless I get into one of these situations.  Eric, why wasn't the milk gotten from the deli that is right downstairs from this very building?  Okay.  One, I didn't send him so I don't know where he went.  Two, apparently I've been told they don't sell milk downstairs at that deli.  They don't sell milk downstairs, Danny?  They don't have sealed milk downstairs at the deli.  What do they have?  I don't care if it's sealed.  They'll put it in like a coffee cup.  But that's fine.  Oh, see, now, how is anyone to know?  You wouldn't come up with that and go, 
[00:52:00]  What is it?  I don't know what that animal's doing.  It's open!  It's open!  It's an open container, Tina!  Hold on.  No, that's where I'm different than Jimmy.  I don't really care about that.  Especially under this situation.  I just need to get food in me.  I don't care.  Well, I kind of understand.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  You know what we need?  Emergency Parmalat milk.  You put it in a cabinet somewhere and it lasts forever.  It sits there and then when you open it up, then it's got to be refrigerated.  But it's like in case of emergency, break glass and you have your milk right there. 
[00:52:30]  We have that.  I said that when I came in.  Stop it!  We have whole milk Parmalat.  That's all we have.  And he looked at me and did nothing.  What's wrong with the Parmalat thing?  Because I didn't know what that was.  No one does.  No, I really didn't know what that was.  No, no, it's regular milk.  It's just been processed in a way that it's good until you open it.  Here's the other problem.  There is milk in the refrigerator, but you don't know if it went sour or anything.  That's Parmalat right there.  That's Parmalat right there.  I really don't know what that is.  It's milk.  It's real milk.  There's nothing different about it. 
[00:53:00]  It's just the way it's processed.  It can last sealed.  It can last for a long time.  Can I explain something to Dean in the Bronx?  I know I'm whining.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  I understand.  Anthony brought it up during commercials going, dude, you sound like a raving woman.  I had to look right at Opie and go, you sound like a madman.  You're trying to wake me up out of this weird coma state I get into.  It has nothing to do with being like Patrice from Brazil is saying, come on, come on.  I feel the whole blood sugar level thing dropping in my body drastically, okay? 
[00:53:30]  We still have a radio show to do.  And then I'm looking at the clock and all the meters, you know, counting down thinking,  I don't have enough time to eat before we get back on the air.  And then they walk in with the milk in a Dwayne Reed bag.  I'm like, I know where Dwayne Reed is.  It's not close to here.  No.  So who went and got it?  Ricky.  Oh.  Of course it was Ricky.  He stinks.  If Opie wants milk, he only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  No Dwayne Reed. 
[00:54:00]  Never Dwayne Reed.  Jesus.  That is an odd place to get milk.  Mike from Jersey.  My goodness.  Look, I'm calming down already.  Mike?  Where to buy your cold medicine?  Dairy barn?  Long Island joke.  Mikey?  Opie, you sound like Doc from Back to the Future right now.  It's like you're asking for 10,000 gigawatts.  That's a stretch.  Yeah.  All right.  There he is.  Now we'll listen to Opie eat because he had to go to Dwayne Reed for the milk.  I thought, stupid me, by the time the mashup was done, I would have had the... 
[00:54:30]  You'd have been done.  You'd have been on seconds already.  And no one would have cared and, you know, the show would have just moved on.  You'd have been on your seconds.  The Opie and Anthony Show, XM202.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  I don't know who took their shoes off.  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, I got something for you today.  Yeah.  Listen to this little thing.  Yes.  Yes.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[00:55:00]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Gotta love the listeners.  Cool.  They participate in this show.  Never thought Anthony rhymes with Socrates.  Ever.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  We get so much show prep from our listeners.  It is like a people's radio show at this point.  It's worse than the Paisano commercial.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  It's like he's drooling in the middle of it. 
[00:55:30]  He goes...  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Who is this spit-sucking mutant?  I don't know.  Who made that?  Uh...  P-niggity, I guess.  P-niggity?  P-niggity.  He's done some better stuff than that.  Wait, there's six versions of this thing.  Oh, great.  Are they all the same?  Maybe we picked the wrong one out, Eric.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[00:56:00]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  I love when they have to put the accent on the wrong syllable, too.  Socrates.  Just to make it rhyme you?  Yeah.  Why?  It works.  That's awful.  What are the answers?  Where can they be?  Let's just ask Professor Anthony.  Professor.  Professor?  I have a professor on my penis.  He shops on Melrose like Liberace.  This is Rodeo.  What's your question for Professor Anthony? 
[00:56:30]  Never even went down Melrose.  You jerk off.  Who's Liberace?  This guy's really annoying me.  Who's Liberace?  Liberace.  Can we hear that verse again?  Hold on.  Please.  Yeah.  Listen to that one.  He shops on Melrose like Liberace.  What's your question for Professor Anthony?  That would be really tough unless you, I don't know, dig him up and pop him up.  Yeah.  This is horrible.  I like the first one though.  I hate it.  My old saliva mouth is having fun.  He's a high school dropout but a true pro- 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  It takes a shot at you here.  High school dropout.  That was.  He's a high school dropout but a true prodigy.  Don't fear Professor Anthony.  Professor.  You are a true prodigy though.  True prodigy.  He knows a little about lots of things.  Used to have a fro Professor Anthony.  What?  Used to have a what?  A fro?  Oh, he used to have a fro.  Yeah, but it doesn't rhyme with, now he stopped even trying to rhyme. 
[00:57:30]  When your elevator hits terminal velocity, it's too late to call Professor Anthony.  That's funny.  I'll give him that one.  Yeah.  I think we'll go with the first one.  It's creepy.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  That's the one we're going to use.  And it'll get stuck in everyone's head too.  So.  That's the one we'll use.  Maybe I'll talk about why the body produces saliva. 
[00:58:00]  Awful.  Well.  I hear him say, and he's starting me.  Anthony, we played that there.  So all them girls got cookies.  We played that there because Stalker Patty got involved with science.  Well, it seems on Whack Bag, the unofficial message board.  Wait, can I go to the phone?  Of course you can.  I'm a little distracted here.  Because Sally makes a very good point.  We didn't even comment on this. 
[00:58:30]  Sally.  Yes.  What's up?  Who has a xylophone anymore?  That's what he was playing, wasn't he?  That's a xylophone.  Yeah.  Just sitting there plunking on it with one of those little balls on the head of a stick.  And singing it.  Do you think he actually had a xylophone or he pulled that off the net?  Yeah.  And just decided to make the tune to whatever tune that he had on the internet.  It would be really creepy if he had those things you play the xylophone with.  They're not really drumsticks.  They have that big ball on the end.  Yeah.  And with a marimba shirt on like Desi Arnaz. 
[00:59:00]  You know?  With the frilly sleeves.  Hey, good observation.  Thanks, Sally.  What a freak.  All right.  See, we're nice to women on this show.  Don't be scared of us, ladies.  Yeah.  Because she wasn't in front of you to call her a pig.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  He is not, absolutely not playing the xylophone.  Here he is again. 
[00:59:30]  I love the xylophone.  That xylophone played very well.  Got the brrrr.  Yeah, you got to have loose wrist to play like that.  Of course.  Limp wrist, would you say?  Yeah.  Loose limp.  Was Mike Brady playing?  Those were his ribs when he was coughing.  A little pee that Alice made for him ricocheting off his ribs making that sound.  Can you make sure Jim just didn't go anywhere?  There you go.  Apparently, whack bag had a discussion about our little physics lesson that went on in here the other day about an elevator dropping and what would happen to various objects or people inside that elevator if it was just free falling. 
[01:00:00]  Would the object float around inside of it?  Would it stay on the floor?  Is it weightless?  Does it have weight?  Would it hit the roof of the elevator if it was just free falling or if it was pulled down under some type of power?  We had this whole discussion on that for some reason. 
[01:00:30]  Well, whack bag took it upon themselves to get together and have a little debate about this little physics lesson.  And who got involved?  Stalker Patty, whose name on the board, of course, trying to be incognito and not be recognized or get any attention.  Her name is Stalker Patty.  Here she goes.  This is in her words.  In her words.  I'm not scientifically minded, but I like to experiment with concepts. 
[01:01:00]  I took some objects and dropped them and discovered that a heavier object, a book, fell and hit the floor at the same moment as a lighter object, a beanie baby.  So, picture, if you will, Stalker Patty is in her little Hubble apartment playing Mr. Scientist.  She's now, you know, doing an ancient experimentation in her apartment. 
[01:01:30]  Who is that?  Galileo?  Did Galileo do that?  Sir Isaac Newton.  Isaac Newton did this.  They've got to change the theme song to Opie knows a little something about something.  No, I know, but I believe Galileo did the experiment off the leaning tower of Pisa.  Oh, no.  Where he dropped two objects.  Is Anthony right again?  Who is who?  Forget Aristotle.  Who the fuck Socrates?  Here comes Professor Stalker Patty.  Anthony, I want to openly apologize.  Thank you.  I'm sorry. 
[01:02:00]  I question your knowledge.  By the way, if Stalker Patty is listening, please call the show.  You know who I'd like to talk to even more than her is the poor guy who lives underneath her?  Yeah.  Who has to hear this fucking dumbbell dropping books and beanie babies on the floor all afternoon?  Shut up!  That bodied retard.  And what, how, never mind.  She was dropping objects.  Yeah.  Now, ancient experimentation has taught us that it doesn't matter the weight of the object.  Gravity, they both react the same to gravity. 
[01:02:30]  She's doing experiments that we did in third grade.  Yes, we did.  But the odd thing is, there was some people on Whackbag, one guy actually posted, and I  was laughing at this.  He goes, as we all know, he goes, as we all know, a lighter object will accelerate at a  slower rate than a heavier object.  And I'm reading it, as we all know, what?  Even Stalker Patty, through her in-depth analysis of this, came up with a different,  a different, what would you call that? 
[01:03:00]  Help me out there.  Conclusion.  Conclusion!  Thank you!  I was going to go with...  I was going to say contusion.  I was going to go with hypotheses.  No, a hypothesis is different than a conclusion.  Yes.  In what way, Anthony?  Well, a hypothesis is just kind of an idea, kind of what you believe is going to happen  in theory, and a conclusion is indeed a conclusion, sir.  Forget Aristotle, and fuck Socrates, here comes Professor Anthony. 
[01:03:30]  Thank you, Anthony.  I get knowledge every day from you.  Thank you.  Obviously, I have some competition here, because Patty wasn't satisfied with the book Beanie  Baby little experiment.  I then tried it with a piece of paper and a book, and noted this time that the heavier  object felt easter.  The paper was caught up in its own wind draft, and floated to the floor, around three or four 
[01:04:00]  seconds behind the book.  So she actually knows that the wind resistance, the air affecting the piece of paper, changed  the experiment.  Is that the Mr. Wizard song?  Yes, it is.  Mrs. Wizard.  It would be gravity itself that should pull an elevator free falling down a shaft. 
[01:04:30]  It's the only type of shaft she has any knowledge of.  And that the person inside would be part of the weight of the elevator.  It would fall as one unit.  If the person were outside the elevator falling beside it in the shaft, even though both were  at different weights, both would hit the ground at the same time.  If a feather, almost weightless, were falling next to the elevator, it would be caught in 
[01:05:00]  spirals of wind that would not respond as readily to the gravitational pull of the earth.  This is stalker Patty, mind you.  And she's wrong.  Both objects would not hit the ground at the same time unless they were in an airless environment.  Right.  You're right.  They don't accelerate at the same rate of speed.  If you have a feather in a person, that's the same theory.  In a vacuum, it would work.  But in the atmosphere, of course, the feather is going to be caught up in the air and not  fall at the same rate. 
[01:05:30]  That doesn't mean that the whole theory is wrong.  The objects do.  It doesn't matter.  Their weight will fall at the same rate.  That's just the way it is.  In a vacuum.  In a vacuum.  Yeah.  In a vacuum.  How about not in a vacuum?  They won't, if they're both solid.  If they're both solid, it depends.  If something's as light as a feather and really affected by the wind, then they're not  going to fall at the same rate.  If you take something like a hammer and an anvil and drop them at the same time, they'll  both fall at the same time.  Oh, they will?  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  How about like a brick and a car?  A brick and a car?  It's like that big of a weight difference.  Fall at the same time.  Oh, they will.  If you drop them at the same time, they will both hit the ground at the same time.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Even if they're dropped from a height where the weight can really make a difference in  the speed pickup?  It doesn't matter how high.  They'll both hit the ground at the same time.  I actually was wrong about that, right?  It's all about wind resistance.  That means you can't like hold them and try to, you know, then one hits before the other.  That's in like ideal circumstances where they're exactly the same height.  They're released at exactly the same time and in a vacuum would be the ideal situation. 
[01:06:30]  But what I'm saying is the way wind resistance will stop a feather.  Yeah.  Right.  Would wind resistance also work on a solid object to a lesser degree?  Like a brick.  Yeah.  You know something?  It probably would.  The bottom of a car would probably catch more air than a brick would and maybe that  would or the lighter brick.  Who knows?  But in an ideal situation, in a vacuum, they fall at the same time.  That's what the whole thing is based on.  Not wind resistance.  You're talking about gravity. 
[01:07:00]  Not, you know, an atmosphere and air affecting the thing, so.  Okay.  I also tested some of this by putting a smaller object on top of a larger object.  Placing a wooden block inside of a larger frame and dropping it.  And came up with my conclusion.  Talk about what I did and learned.  Talk about the what did I learn feature of the show.  Talk about.  Yeah.  Talk about the what did I learn feature of the show here. 
[01:07:30]  Please excuse me.  I'm not a scientist.  Yeah.  We were really confusing that.  But I had fun today.  She's in her apartment.  Experimenting.  This lunatic.  I love you.  What is that?  Wow, Eric.  That's not the song.  What is that, Eric?  God, that wrecked my whole bit.  Oh, my God.  I see where you were going. 
[01:08:00]  That's it.  Nah, we'll let Derek do it, Eric.  Right.  Thank you, Eric.  You're not needed anymore.  Right.  Derek does it better.  That's Eric with a D.  Thank you, Derek.  Derek knows how to find Thomas Dolby.  She blinded me with science.  You bet he does.  A monstrosity in motion.  With her crusty clown face on.  There she is in her apartment doing scientific experiments.  Science!  She blinded me with her awful body. 
[01:08:30]  Science!  So I dropped the book in a Beanie Baby.  Next, I'm going to try to extract oil from a peanut in blackface.  There she goes.  Patty doing little experiments in her house.  Did you notice the last four sentences?  She has an exclamation point at the end of each one that really annoys me.  Miss exclamation point.  There she goes. 
[01:09:00]  I'm glad she has time to do this.  I thought she was working all the time, but apparently she has time to go home and do little experiments.  Is she trying to figure out if the earth revolves around the sun or if all the planets revolve around the earth?  Oh, how about that?  No, the earth is actually just perched on top of a tortoise's back and you could fall off the edge if you go too close to the heavens.  Patty, I got another experiment for you.  Close all your windows, mix bleach and ammonia together, and breathe deeply. 
[01:09:30]  Tell me what your conclusion is after that.  Her next experiment, she's going to leave her apartment and just start walking.  Yeah, there you go.  To see if the earth is flat and if she'll fall over the edge eventually.  Patty, try to reach the horizon.  Go ahead, keep walking.  I like to see her do the R. Bud Dwyer experiment where she yanks a pistol out of a paper bag at a press conference.  Puts it in her mouth and fires.  Yeah, to see what hits the ground, the falling bullet or your brain matter. 
[01:10:00]  Ah, Patty.  We got some kooks to listen to this show.  Scientist Patty.  They had a whole discussion on that.  Yeah, on the message board.  Yeah.  Great.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates, here comes Professor Anthony.  Great.  October 2nd.  Today, my life began.  My parents do not know it yet.  I am as small as the pollen of a flower.  But it is I already.  I will be a boy.  I will have blonde hair and blue eyes.  Nearly everything is settled already. 
[01:10:30]  October 19th.  I have grown a little, but I am still too small to do anything by myself.  My mother does everything for me, although she still does not know that she is killing me under her heart.  But I am a real person, just as a crumb of bread is still real bread.  My mother exists, and I do too.  I do too.  October 23rd.  My mouth is just now beginning to open.  Just think.  In a year or so, I will be laughing, or later I will start to talk.  My first word will be, Mama. 
[01:11:00]  October 23rd.  Stay?  I am a real person.  My mother does everything for me, although she still does not know that she is killing me under her heart.  But I am a real person, just as a crumb of bread is still real bread.  My mother exists, and I do too.  October 23rd.  My mouth is just now beginning to open.  Just think.  In a year or so, I will be laughing, or later I will start to talk.  My first word will be, Mama.  October 23rd.  The day my heart began to beat, it will beat softly for the rest of my life, never stopping.  After many years, I will tire, and stop, then I shall die. 
[01:11:30]  November 2nd.  Yeah.  This is bullshit.  First of all, there's no way to get a tape recorder in there.  And second of all, how come he was talking and then he says my mouth is now opening?  My mouth is opening, right.  This is crap.  You're right.  This is not real.  I don't think this is a real recording of a fetus.  It's called The Diary of an Unborn Fetus.  Oh.  Dude, a kid can't eat.  There's no way for a kid to write.  It's got no pen in there.  Come on.  Today I saw a big hog come poke me in the head. 
[01:12:00]  Mommy's still having sex, the slut.  I hear the sound of a vacuum cleaner.  Mommy must be cleaning the rug.  Wait a minute.  It's headed this way.  Oh no.  My little arm got sucked out.  Jim Abbott, here I come.  My God, man.  Trying to share with everybody.  Today I'm going on a ride.  Suddenly the nourishment has stopped from Mama. 
[01:12:30]  What looks like a fist came through the womb, kind of like Freddie did in that original nightmare on Elm Street when his face comes through the wall.  Did you see five knuckles? 
[01:13:00]  Can I continue?  I am growing continually.  My arms and legs are taking shape.  But I must wait a long time before this tiny lady will raise me to my mother's arms.  November 12th.  Tiny fingers are beginning to form on my hands.  How small they are.  One day I'll stroke my mother's hair and tell her how nice she is.  November 20th.  Only today the doctor told my mother that I'm living here under her heart. 
[01:13:30]  How happy she must be.  Are you happy mother?  November 25th.  Today mommy got told I'm a mongoloid.  Mother was happy.  But father kicked her down the stairs.  And said, let's make sure this is mine you pig.  And mother's parents are not happy.  Because mother is white.  But I am half black and half white.  Mother's father in do the right thing beat her and threw her out of the house. 
[01:14:00]  For sleeping with Flipper.  Are you insane?  Mommy took thalidomide.  I have arms like a seal.  I'm in the womb only.  And already I have thought of other men. 
[01:14:30]  I'm daddy's disappointment.  I'm a woman trapped in a man's body who's still in a woman's body because I haven't been born yet to humiliate my family with my transgendered nonsense.  In 18 years I'll be performing sex on someone who thinks I'm a girl.  My mouth opened today.  And in a few years a luscious hog will slip between the lips.  And my little fingers will clutch money that's handed to me. 
[01:15:00]  And I'll leap out of the Saturn.  Can I continue?  I'm sorry.  Brought something to the program today.  It's nice.  I like it.  You make a mockery of it.  Today is Thanksgiving.  My mother and father are probably thinking about a name for me.  And they don't even know that I am a little boy.  So they are probably calling me Barbara. 
[01:15:30]  But I want to be called Andy.  December 24th.  Funny every time.  I am growing so big.  December 10th.  My hair is growing.  It is as bright and shiny as the sun.  I wonder what kind of hair my mother has. 
[01:16:00]  December 13th.  My eyes are almost fully developed.  Although the lips are still shut.  When mother brings me into the world.  It will be full of sunshine and overflowing with flowers.  Unless my eyes don't work and I'm black.  Then Jamie Foxx will play me and annoy the whole country.  Oh my god.  March 2nd. 
[01:16:30]  Someone left me in Don Geronimo's driveway.  That fat fuck backs over me.  Oh my god.  Someday I will grow to be big and strong and go swimming in Tommy Lee's pool. 
[01:17:00]  He'll be too busy giving hepatitis to a supermodel to rescue me.  Have the flu do ya?  Fucker.  You weren't too sick to let a baby drown.  Can I continue?  Yes.  I don't know why the baby sounds like an old lady when I do it.  Let me tell you sonny.  Really fast go to Chip.  Hey Chip.  Yes.  What's up Chip?  Not too much. 
[01:17:30]  Long time listener.  First time caller.  Who gives a shit?  I was just wondering if this was more lost tapes from Demented World.  Are you trying to say that I'm playing the part of the baby?  Sure sounded a lot like yesterday.  You motherfucker.  Soon I'm gonna be born and live the rest of my life in Ben's pants.  I have never seen a flower you know, but more than anything I want to see my mommy. 
[01:18:00]  How do you look mommy?  December 24th.  I wonder if my mother hears the delicate beat of my heart.  Some children are born with sickly hearts and then the gentle fingers of a doctor performs miracles to make them healthy.  But my heart is healthy.  It beats so evenly.  Tup Tup.  Tup Tup.  You shall have a healthy son mother.  And then one day I'll be born and mama will bathe me and my four brothers and drown all of us. 
[01:18:30]  I better get used to this water I'm in.  I love my mommy.  Someday she's gonna get rich by taking money from an androgynous pale pedophile to poke me in my little pooper.  I want to know what mama looks like and have my little fingers crossed that she doesn't drive an SUV.  Someday she'll lovingly strap me in a car seat and back us down a boat ramp and then wave at me and blame it on the jiggable. 
[01:19:00]  And all of this hard work will be for naught I'll wind up in Andrew Gore's living room in a jar.  And I'll have to look at that freak for the rest of my existence.  That germaphobe who takes two hours to leave the house. 
[01:19:30]  December 28th.  Today, my mother killed me.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[01:20:00]  Who the hell saw that coming?  And mother only killed me because I sound like Bobby when Howie Mandel does him.  Good.  Who the hell saw that coming?  Mother killed me.  Now I will never cry on a plane or in a movie theater and annoy everyone.  You shall have a healthy son, mother.  December 28th.  Today, my mother killed me. 
[01:20:30]  Is that how it ends?  Oh, I know the point of this.  Why did...  No, there's a song?  There's a why did my mommy kill me song?  Yes.  Too bad mother didn't kill me before I thought of the lyrics to this awful song.  I gotta hear him say my mommy killed me.  Oh, you do?  I don't know where that was.  Right behind it. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  And then going into the song is great.  Oh, boy.  I went too far.  But my heart is healthy.  It beats so evenly.  Tap, tap, tap, tap.  You shall have a healthy son, mother.  December 28th.  Today, my mother killed me.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:21:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wow.  Boy, this dumpster is smelly.  Wait, I want to know.  Tool bag, thank you.  I know that the kid is about to sing.  I just want to know what the song is. 
[01:22:00]  We have to actually get to the rest of that.  This kid is really going to annoy me.  All right.  Are you ready for the song?  Yes.  The kid's little song.  Everyone buckle up for this.  All right.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  That's not the song.  I'm sorry.  I pushed the wrong button.  All right.  So you guys are ready for the song, right?  You little scumbag.  Wow.  A little harsh. 
[01:22:30]  Let's all calm down.  Sounds nice and happy and fun.  They're paying for it.  You vacuum it out.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Everyone's ready for the song, right?  I don't know.  Oh, my goodness.  I got to rewind the tape.  What's that?  Some kind of sick joke?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We're ready for the song, Jimmy?  Let's hear the little...  I want to hear the song.  We can be...  The little fetus.  Yeah, what is it?  All right.  Here it is.  The internet is for porn. 
[01:23:00]  The internet is for porn.  Me up all night, hugging me horn to porn.  Dorn, Dorn.  That's not it.  Wait a minute.  All right.  You ready for the song?  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the song.  End scene.  Oh, God.  All right.  For a little guy.  Here is the song. 
[01:23:30]  Why did you kill me, buddy?  When God made me special for you?  I really wanted to see you 
[01:24:00]  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  And put my little arms around you  Shut up!  Why did you show me?  Mommy, who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy?  You really killed for me.  Stop whining. 
[01:24:30]  Stop whining.  You like discipline.  I wonder what I would have grown up to be.  It's not a tool.  It's not a tool.  I guess I'll never know.  Because mommy, you killed me.  Shut up!  Quiet.  Stop it!  Stop whining. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, jeez.  Yes, sir.  Did he say my little arms are all goo?  I don't know.  I'll have to listen on the replay.  I don't know.  Why did my mommy kill me?  Who saw that coming?  Wow.  Except for us.  How big is this girl's cunt that a whole band can get in there and play for this kid?  She's in a box like the Titanic.  Kid's being sucked out and the band plays on.  You put your right arm in and the vacuum sucks it out. 
[01:25:30]  Wow.  I thought he was going to be carried out in his little take the baby home clothes and he's  just in a plastic biohazard bag.  He's laying next to a Reuben behind a building.  Newspapers thrown on him. 
[01:26:00]  Little rats eating his fingers.  Why did my mommy kill me?  What a haunting song.  That's wonderful.  You're going to have to throw that in my...  That's wonderful, that song.  I want this in my instant replay.  It should be in your iPod.  That is a great song.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let's go to the phones and say hi to Tom in Philly. 
[01:26:30]  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, hey guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Tom.  I'm going to guess from the things that you and Don Geronimo have a lot in common, Opie.  Ramone, chill that dog.  Punch it out.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Oh.  A little story yesterday.  Well, maybe this will help.  Dead puppies. 
[01:27:00]  Dead, dead, dead, dead.  Dead puppies.  Dead puppies are much fun.  Come on, everybody out there.  Sing along, okay?  Dead, dead, dead, dead puppies.  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead puppies.  Dead puppies are much fun. 
[01:27:30]  One more time for Roman Rescot.  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead puppies.  Dead, dead, dead puppies.  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead happily.  Breaking news out of Washington, D.C.  Anthony, you want to take this one? 
[01:28:00]  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Geronimo backs over dog.  We now learn why the Don and Mike show was in rerun mode yesterday on WJFK.  Don Geronimo accidentally backed over his little toto dog, Rudy,  with his SUV in the driveway of his Great Falls home.  The canine died on his way to the vet. 
[01:28:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[01:29:00]  and here's what he writes dear Casey this may seem to be a strange dedication  request but I'm quite sincere and it'll need a lot if you play it recently there  was a death in our family he was a little dog named Snuggles but he was  most certainly a part of let's go start again from coming out of the record play  the record okay please see when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers 
[01:29:30]  man is impossible to make those transitions and then you got to go into  somebody dying you know they do this to me all the time I don't know what the  hell they do it for but goddamn it if we can't come out of a slow record I don't  understand it is down on the phone okay I want a goddamn concerted effort to come  out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo record every time I do a  goddamn death dedication now make it and I also want to know what happened to the  pictures I was supposed to see this week it's a god last goddamn time I want 
[01:30:00]  somebody who's his fucking brain to not come out of a goddamn record that is  that's up-tempo and I got to talk about a fucking dog dying sorry I just had to  throw that in there is that John on the phone is he on his phone in the SUV tell  him to pull forward he just ran over his little dog and now a letter from a man  about bad breath SUVs and a dog smelly mouth fat fuck anyone else I would be 
[01:30:30]  like oh that's that's a shame but that guy that that phony that crock of shit oh  hi I'm Casey Kasem and this bloody mess is Rudy the little crushed dog  the letters from John in Great Falls it reads dear Casey I was hoping I'd run over 
[01:31:00]  my bitch wife Frida but I hit little Rudy how am I supposed to come out of a goddamn up-tempo  number into a hysterical story like Don Geronimo running over his fucking dog  emotionally distraught  wow that's rough oh man how the hell did that happen and then he couldn't do it 
[01:31:30]  scatting now that looking over your shoulder having a good day my go and  that what was that little little boom boom boom oh there he is laying in the  driveway down to just scoop him up and put him in the SUV and drive off to the vet  tears in his eyes I guess he tries to breathe life into his little dog  Oh, was little Barty crying? 
[01:32:00]  Frida?  Are they going to look at Daddy like the guy that killed their goddamn dog?  That's the worst.  You know, when you find your dog splattered in the street, it's bad enough.  When you kill him yourself, oh, that's got to hurt.  That's got to leave a mark with the family.  When you walk in from work and say, hi, honey, I'm home, and she looks at you,  oh, dog killer's home.  The guy that killed the one little joy I have in life, he's home today. 
[01:32:30]  You get another one.  I'm sure you could replace it.  Yeah.  Just like Mike.  If you ran over Mike, he'd do the same thing.  Those two hate each other.  Hate each other.  Man, that's too bad.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  What's funny, he couldn't do his show, though.  He was too distraught.  Too distraught.  Running over his little dog. 
[01:33:00]  With an SUV.  Ouch.  I wonder if it was the driver's side.  Probably what killed him.  That big gut.  Big fat Don on that side of the SUV.  Extra weight.  Couldn't take it.  Fat fuck.  Ugh.  He probably didn't even back over the dog.  It smelled his breath and then just killed itself.  Killed over.  Remember we used to have to spray the Mike sponges and stuff?  Yeah, Don and Mike was on the same station as ours back in the day, and they failed miserably. 
[01:33:30]  And then when we got fired, they took over for us in a lot of the markets, and they failed  in just about all those markets as well, including Philly was the big one.  And every once in a while, because they were situated in Washington, they would come up and do their show from the New York studios, and they'd use the same microphones that Ant and I would use before us.  The smell that would come up and do it, and the smell that would come off my microphone was unbelievable.  Yeah.  And then it was a, I guess it's a known fact that he has just horrendous breath.  Well, we had a whole thing we had to do. 
[01:34:00]  We had to wash out the mic screens and then Lysol the hell out of it.  Yeah.  It was just god-awful.  Ugh.  His breath smelled like a dead dog laying in the driveway, I would gather.  Ginny from Jersey saying, killing his dog is the funniest thing Don's done in years.  That's great.  Looks like boo-boo made of boo-boo.  Ramon, bring me a shovel. 
[01:34:30]  Mm-hmm.  And just for the rest of them to have to sit there on the air and watch this fat jackass eulogize his awful animal and not laugh in his face.  Ugh.  You think they all had to be some, you know, fakes and, you know, be sincere and stuff.  Hey, I'm sorry.  Oh, darn, man.  Oh, that's a shame.  Wow, that really does, man.  That's terrible.  I can't believe that happened.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's awful.  Sorry.  Sorry to hear about your dog.  We lost ours a few years ago.  Yes, yes.  It was tragic for the family. 
[01:35:00]  But, you know, you've got to move on, Don.  That's right.  What'd you do, eat it?  Jim in Jersey, what's up, Jim?  Precious.  Hope you're feeling better, baby.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  You know, I think we should all call over to Don today.  Maybe give him our condolences.  That would just be the nice thing to do.  That's not a bad idea.  You know, that would be nice.  That would be nice.  I'm sure he's hurting real bad today.  That's true.  The Don and Mike show in Washington.  It only happened a couple days ago. 
[01:35:30]  So, I think today will be the first day he's back on the air.  So, oh, my God.  Please, someone tape what he has to say about his little doggy.  Oh, we would love to hear it.  Please, someone tape that and send it in.  And can I say to any callers, please, if you call him, just because he's an enemy of the  Opium Anthony show, he's really going to have a bad day.  So, be sensitive.  Yeah.  No off-color remarks about his dog.  Of course not.  Please.  Be sensitive.  I was reading a website that has some stuff from the Don and Mike show about Don running 
[01:36:00]  his dog over.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It has, like, a little thing of what happened.  Somebody's writing it.  I don't know who it is.  But it says, I apologize.  There was no show yesterday.  It wasn't a beef with infinity.  It was something awful happened to me yesterday.  No, I guess these are Don's words.  I'm getting ready to leave, and the dogs are running around the car.  I shoo them away, and nine times out of ten, they get away.  But this time, I started down the driveway, and I hear a thump. 
[01:36:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  And then it goes to some other person, because then it says, Don said he got out of the car,  went to the side of the car, and Rudy had been hit.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I started freaking out.  I'm screaming and crying and running around.  Frida came out, and they both took Rudy to the vet.  Fortunately, our vet is close, but unfortunately, Rudy had passed away by the time we arrived. 
[01:37:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Don apologized, but everyone understood.  Maybe you'll find this amusing.  When I was in the shower, I had no idea that Frida was even close by.  I was having a real conversation with God about what happened with Rudy.  Oh, my God.  I called him a motherfucker, Don said.  When he went downstairs, Frida said she heard his conversation with God.  I mean, I really gave it to him. 
[01:37:30]  Don and Mike decided to take some calls.  Don, my husband ran over our dog and killed it.  I cried for two weeks.  How's he?  Let's just say he had to tell the kids it was the first time I'd ever seen him cry.  Mike said, what a wuss.  Mike explained that someone had to make the first joke.  Of what, their career?  You know, Mike just wants to tease this fat asshole and he can't.  Of course he does.  Little yappy dog getting smushed. 
[01:38:00]  Had a ribbon in its hair, probably.  Thump.  I heard the thump.  I had a conversation with God in the shower.  God!  God, why do I suck so much?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why did I fail in Philly?  Why?  Why?  Oh, yeah.  Why did you make me hit Rudy?  Little dog.  Yeah, so that's it.  He killed his dog and then had a little conversation with God in the shower, which conjures up an 
[01:38:30]  even more awful image.  A naked, wet Don Geronimo preaching to God.  Yelling at God.  Yelling at God.  God, why is my cock so small?  And the reason Frida heard the conversation is because she has to lift his stomach so he  can wash his dick.  Fuck you and your boring on-air wife, stupid.  There we go.  Yeah.  XM202.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck. 
[01:39:00]  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We also got some time on Dynamite's show yesterday, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  These dopes play right into our hands.  Sure.  We really don't care what you say about us.  Just say our names.  You're playing right into our hands.  That's all that matters.  We're attempting the biggest comeback in radio history and we're going to need some help  out there and these guys are playing right into our hands by mentioning us and telling  everyone where we're broadcasting.  Did they?  Pesky listeners. 
[01:39:30]  I believe so, yeah.  Well, we got one of the greatest radio stories ever.  Don from the Don and Mike show ran over his little dog going to work.  His little dog, Rudy.  I guess they bought when I was reading his wife had a eulogy online or something.  Are you shitting me?  That someone emailed to me.  Was it real or was he goofing on you with his email?  No, it's real.  It's real?  She explained where they got Rudy and stuff, which was New York City when Don and Mike were  attempting to do radio in New York and failed miserably. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  So they got it from a little doggy store on the Upper East Side.  Eric, you got that email?  What email?  Wow, you're just not in sync with me today.  I'm doing a million other things.  You're usually really good.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  Just getting a lot of other stuff done.  You're sick too, right?  Yeah, very.  So wait a minute.  You're saying that he backed over two things?  One was the puppy and the other tire went over the Arbitron books?  0.7 in New York, you zilch.  But he's going to make fun of us. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, hanging out by the skateboard, Stan.  Don from Munaki.  That unfunny fuck.  Oh, you got it?  Ah, there it is.  Wow, that is long.  Anthony.  So a whole eulogy?  And a little picture of the little doggy.  Can I ask, how much attention does his wife need that she always has to be on the air or blogging?  Can't you just do your job, cook dinner, and go, when Fatso gets home, that's your job.  You're not a talented on-air personality, sweetheart. 
[01:41:00]  Sorry.  Wives.  He's a cute little fella, though, the little dog.  He was.  Wives stink on the radio.  Always.  Really.  You want me to read it?  You can read it briefly.  Yeah, go ahead.  Rudy, from Frida's Column on the website.  I can't listen to Don's show today because he's going to talk about Rudy.  Rudy seems dumb to be this sad about a dog when there are so many bigger problems in the world.  But what can I do?  I've lost loved ones before, family members, and I know that whether it's a human or a pet, 
[01:41:30]  you just have to get through it and wait for the sadness to subside.  Rudy was a fluke from the beginning.  A fluke?  I thought it was a dog.  Well, well, well.  We already had two dogs and didn't need a third.  But I was in New York City watching my husband fail miserably.  Oh, which part did I add in?  And was surprised to find a chi-chi pet shop while walking around the Upper East Side.  This place was so fancy.  It had a huge chandelier in the foyer and everything you could ever imagine to spoil your pet. 
[01:42:00]  If you had more money than sense, ha, ha, ha.  I'm an animal lover, and I know that pet shops just encourage the puppy mills.  But that doesn't mean I can't stop and look at the puppies.  And this shop had the cutest, unusual breeds with coats colored I'd never seen before.  Just to tease Bart, I called him and told him that I had just seen the most adorable puppy,  and of course he begged me to get him.  I told him that we couldn't, and using Don as an excuse, I said, Daddy didn't want another dog. 
[01:42:30]  When Don heard that he was being made the bad guy, he called my bluff and told me to go ahead and get the dog.  It was my decision.  I want to puke.  Is this just awful?  I want to puke.  You know what dogs you should have bought those two that mauled that lawyer in San Francisco?  Oh, God.  They should have killed her in the doorway.  Just attacked her.  God, I want to puke.  Do people actually live like this?  Yeah.  Daddy's the bad guy.  So I did the dumbest thing possible when there are so many dogs that need to be adopted 
[01:43:00]  and so many less expensive places to get a dog if you're going to buy instead of adopt.  I took home a little Karen Terrier from the pet shop in New York.  This was the November after 9-11.  So in honor of the man of the hour in New York City, we named him Rudy.  Rudy, they named their dog after Giuliani, huh?  Oh, how awful. 
[01:43:30]  Did it have a little comb over and prostate cancer?  They should have named it failure.  New York City failure.  By the way, daddy is the bad guy.  Fine, I used the same excuse that Hedda Nussbaum used, stupid.  God, I am so glad I'm alone, man.  I can't live like this.  Why am I alone?  People live like this?  Rudy was small, feisty, untrainable, and the sunniest creature I'd ever seen.  Although he was slowly becoming more reliable, he couldn't be trusted not to pee when the mood struck him. 
[01:44:00]  And for that reason, there are little gates all over my house.  It should have been one by your driveway.  Anyway, he was fearless as long as he had a clink at his side.  I guess clink is another one of their dogs?  Probably a funny name.  When he went on walks in the woods, he would dart after any animal he spotted,  thinking he could bring down a squirrel, raccoon, or a deer.  He'd be off on the hunt like a flying slipper. 
[01:44:30]  What?  With a squeaky bark every step of the way.  Doesn't Rudy sound like a fun little guy?  Sounds feisty, Ed.  A little feisty thing.  A little spunky.  He missed out living the posh life with some old lady in the Upper East Side.  But he got a pretty good deal nonetheless.  Sure did.  A tire in the spine.  Boy, I'm sure Rudy would have signed up for that in a second.  Dumpster breath and a tire in the spine.  Paradise, dog. 
[01:45:00]  Welcome to it.  Dog eats his ass just to get the smell of his breath out of his face.  Boy, got a good deal nonetheless.  Are you saying Don has really bad breath?  No, I'm not at all.  I'm saying that Rudy's ass is really nice.  Or was until its intestines were shot out of it, thanks to old late for work.  Clumsily backing over the little fella like it was a speed bump.  Oh, old late for work. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, God damn.  Whether through the woods...  Oh, walks through the woods, brother dogs to wrestle with, and way too much human attention.  Bethann and I often have been teased because our human children have a place in our hearts only marginally more significant than our dogs.  Oh, that's great.  All right, enough. 
[01:46:00]  I've got to apologize.  I know this can't be interesting to anyone but me, and I'm sorry.  Oh, no, it's very interesting.  I won't go on with stories of Rudy except to say one more thing about him.  He was always happy.  My other dogs and my cat will have their moods, but not Rudy.  He was insatiable with affection.  He could be loved...  Oh, he couldn't be loved enough and never stopped wagging.  Any creature that could smile at Don before he had his morning coffee and get a smile and a scratch in return had to be special. 
[01:46:30]  Why did he smile before he had the coffee?  Because he knew that would make the breath completely unbearable?  I better smell it while it's just plaque and dog shit as opposed to coffee on top.  It would be hard not to miss something that made even the crabbiest amongst us smile.  But I figure all of our pets, especially Rudy, are just on loan from God.  That's terrific. 
[01:47:00]  That's terrific.  If they're on loan from God, could you at least return them in good condition?  And not with a broken back and guts hanging out of their mouth, an asshole?  You product damagers.  Yeah, look how you returned my gift.  Yeah, hey, the video's all untangled.  If you borrowed it, could you at least brought it back in decent condition?  You had the loan for another ten years.  You brought it back early and in awful shape.  You're not going to get another one now.  It's going to wreck your dog credit in God's eyes. 
[01:47:30]  On loan from God, yes.  Rudy was a gift for three years, and we're lucky to have had him.  Hopefully he'll come back again to brighten someone else's life.  And then there's a cute little picture of Rudy.  I can't help it.  This is my tribute to Rudy.  This little dog made us laugh.  So in Rudy's memory, I'll put up this link to help other pets in need.  They have a little animal rescue link to the Animal Rescue League.  What do you rescue the animals from?  Inattentive owners?  Don's tire. 
[01:48:00]  You know what's funny?  By the way, on a whack bag, I don't remember which one of the guys did it, so I can't credit you.  But one of the things had the actual photo of Rudy.  Yeah.  And it had, of course, a tire drawn on with blood all over it.  And the caption was,  I trusted you, you fat fuck.  Trusting little dog.  You just know, too, he was jumping around the car because he, you know, there's his master. 
[01:48:30]  And he's all happy to see him.  He's leaving for work.  Don just going, you know, get out of the way.  Come on, get out of the way.  Oh, my God.  Puts it in reverse.  Little Rudy jumping up and down and all of a sudden jumping.  I'm so happy to see my, oh, the pain.  Why the pain?  Not understanding what it's all about.  Why his master is inflicting him with such pain.  Ow, why have you hurt me when I've only given you love?  Ow.  Yeah, and then slowly death creeps in. 
[01:49:00]  Well, he didn't know to get away because Don was going, shoo, shoo.  And as far as Rudy's concerned, that's what his breath smells like, the underside of.  Little Rudy.  Little Rudy, gone.  Gone, but not forgotten.  Yeah, not forgotten at all because our listeners got into the program yesterday, Anthony.  Hello.  Why are you calling a radio show that's just begun?  You must have something important to say. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, how much is that dead dog in the driveway?  You guys are the biggest assholes out there, man.  Wow, what's his screen name?  Right to the point, guys?  Wow.  Who's on that thump button, by the way?  Michael J. Fox?  That was the fastest line ever.  How did that get through?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:50:00]  Ash, look at the pictures.  Oh, it's cigars and scotch, by the way.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you got some great stuff on Wackbag.  He does a lot for the program.  Cigars and scotch from wackbag.com.  Look at the picture.  Is that in the Photoshop section?  Yeah.  Look at his little face.  And the tire, and he drew blood all over.  It looks like he's saying that.  I trusted you, you friend. 
[01:50:30]  Goddamn, that is brilliant.  He looks all sad.  God, you heartless bastards.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hello?  Why are you calling a radio show that's just begun?  You must have something important to say.  Yeah, how much is that dead dog in the driveway? 
[01:51:00]  It didn't take long, did it?  No.  It's almost like the 24 hours have passed.  That doesn't hurt.  That doesn't hurt.  I'm going to hurt the dog.  You waited for a long time to do this.  It doesn't hurt.  I only wish it was your head.  No.  You know, I do give Donna Mike some props.  Yeah.  This is the difference between Shannon Burke and Donna Mike.  Shannon Burke, oh, I didn't know what to do.  At least these guys are going with it. 
[01:51:30]  They just went with it, left them on the air to make little injured doggy noises.  At least they took the call and went with it and, you know, tried to do some kind of radio with it.  Unlike Shannon Burke, who's just a newbie in the business, obviously.  Didn't, doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt.  Too bad the little fella couldn't say that.  When your tire was clumsily crushing him in half.  And when you're saying doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt, know what that translates into?  Don wants to strangle this guy.  Oh, yeah, it hurts really bad.  Because you know something?  And then he's laying there in bed with Frida, who is just crying her eyes out. 
[01:52:00]  You know he spent the whole night like that, having a deal with that.  And he comes in, and some heartless bastard.  How much is that doggy in the drive?  And then he's just making dog sounds in the background.  Pat from Munaki says, Rudy looks a little tired.  And another one, Rudy looks a little run down.  That's not bad.  You know, tired.  That's funny.  You pun doing red-faced ass.  Pretty funny, though. 
[01:52:30]  Face is as red as Rudy's pelt.  Your little dog is now a shish kebab in some Korean joint in D.C.  Right now, some expressionless illegal is fucking munching down on his mid-thigh and calf.  Shoving it in his mouth with those chopsticks.  Die, die!  But then again, I could have been riding a tricycle to squash your head. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, I've washed it.  Well, you're very funny.  You're a very funny man.  Hilarious.  Thanks for thinking.  Is there anything else we can do for you?  Oh, they suck.  Well, he's right about that.  He's right about that.  Well, he's right about that.  That's not.  That's Mike, but Mike doesn't really believe that.  We know that.  Yeah.  We have a picture of Mike wearing an Opie and Anthony t-shirt, so.  Yeah.  I mean, stop. 
[01:53:30]  I don't think I have any Don and Mike shirts.  No, I don't think we've ever worn a Don and Mike shirt, but Mike has worn Opie and Anthony t-shirts.  I think there's a picture of him on a boat or something.  Yeah.  With an Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  But he has to agree with Don.  Did he hit a dollar?  What was that?  That was that type.  That type.  I get that little.  There we are.  See?  And then sometimes.  Oh, yes, I, oh.  Sometimes I'm just wondering who's calling before we actually start.  See, because that call was answered technically, if you're listening to the show, before you even heard it. 
[01:54:00]  Because we're on such a delay, it's like, we're on a minute and a half ridiculous delay.  And for whatever reason, after a call like that, I'm always tempted to go, Red Sox Nation!  Thank you.  Seems appropriate.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  Hello, Don and Mike show.  And you go back for more.  I'll try one more.  All right.  Hello.  Broken mic.  Hello.  What happened?  Did you break your chair?  I'm having a bad furniture day. 
[01:54:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Why are you having a bad furniture day?  Are you trying to build a ramp that a dog could hide under?  You animal killer.  That was Mike, I think, having a bad furniture day.  There's just one fat pig with two interchangeable heads.  What, did Don roll his chair over his foot?  Bad furniture day.  Oh, well.  Ow.  Get off my foot, Don.  Most guys that do radio are just really fat guys.  I have just a really quick dumb story. 
[01:55:00]  When I was just starting out in the business, I was working in Rochester.  The biz.  And, you know, the studio was really, really nice, and we had these really, really nice chairs and stools.  And we had a guy that had one of the best voices in radio history working.  I don't want to give his name away, because he actually is a really nice guy.  But he weighed about 400 to 500 pounds easily.  And he was breaking all the chairs in the studio.  Really?  So we, one of my jobs, because I was just a plea back then, was I had a, he was a weekend jock. 
[01:55:30]  On Friday after my shift, I was doing like late night Fridays or whatever, I had to hide all the chairs.  Hide all the chairs in the closet.  Or you break them?  And lock the closet door, because it was getting expensive, because he was breaking chairs almost every weekend.  He was that fat.  Oh, bad furniture day.  So when he said bad furniture day, it just brought back a quick memory.  Hello?  What?  What is this?  What have you just handed me?  That's the guy who just called. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, the guy that just called?  Oh, great.  Hold on.  I'll call him back.  Oh, good.  Is your chair on there?  Yeah.  It seemed like fun.  It was just a momentary glitch.  But I'm a professional.  It's a shame that chair is a man.  Look it up in the book.  Revolutionary Tempur-Pedic material.  I wish it was, how do we get this to the consumer?  Thanks for coming in, Bill.  And no heavy lifting.  Give me a second.  Because this guy I will put on the website.  What the hell?  He was just a jerk. 
[01:56:30]  Well, he's annoyed.  Whoa.  Oh, careful.  I don't have his permission to put his voice on there.  I'm sorry.  Mike is breaking his chair right now.  Sorry.  Mike, I'm sure it's faulty construction.  Wow.  I thought we did nothing on our radio show.  My God.  There's nothing going on here.  And this is the edited version.  Yeah.  I told Steve, edit this down.  And he's talking about putting this guy's phone number on a website.  I am sure it is faulty construction, Mike.  How about just a little lemon? 
[01:57:00]  Junior, can I just get a little lemon in my water?  Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for this guy to pick up the phone.  This is a brave, brave man that called about my dead dog.  Junior, just a drop of honey.  Just a little honey.  Why are the cabinets locked, Junior?  Yeah.  Hey, Paul.  Hold on.  I'm going to leave a message.  Okay.  Really great.  Okay.  Hold on.  This should be good.  I'm just going to leave a message.  All right.  Where are we going?  Hey, Paul.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, Paul, it's Don from Don and Mike. 
[01:57:30]  Remember that funny call that you made right at the beginning of the show about my dead dog?  Hey, guess what, Paul?  www.donandmikewebsite.com in the daily recap.  I'm going to put your phone number there because the Internet is the wild, wild west.  And then everybody can call you and tell you how funny you were.  Yeah.  I come to suck your blood. 
[01:58:00]  Wait, that's not yours.  It's your dog's and it's on a tire.  Great.  Nice Dr. Evil laugh.  Because I know there are jerks like you out there, but just stay on the line to take your medicine.  Don't just hang up.  Good luck at the improv.  See you in hell, Paul.  Bye-bye, Paul. 
[01:58:30]  You'll be the fastest burner of all time.  What?  See you in hell.  See you in hell.  Mwahahahaha.  Mwahahahaha.  Yuck.  Paul.  Paul.  You'll be the fastest burner of all time.  Of all time.  Of all time.  Well, see, I was not prepared for that.  No one was.  Two days ago.  Today, count me prepared.  You're not prepared.  What is this?  God, I hope that was the right number. 
[01:59:00]  He's prepared two days later.  He got over his dead dog quickly.  A few days.  You murdered a loved family pet, and you're over it two days later?  Well, you're a sport.  Wow.  You killed it.  You see how hurt his wife is by reading, you know, her whole thing.  And I'm sorry.  She knows who did it.  You know?  She's got to look at him and go, oh, here comes the guy that killed my little Rudy.  That's going to leave a mark.  And Don was wondering why Kevin Dillon was there going, you see that head come apart? 
[01:59:30]  That's the way the dog barks.  Do it for Rudy and Sal.  Well, there's more.  There's more.  I think he starts taking shots at us, finally.  All right.  Hello, Rocco.  I am on the Baltimore National Pike at Circuit City right near the Westview Mall in a 2004  Nissan Altima.  Hold on a second.  Baltimore National Pike.  How much you weigh?  How much you weigh, dude?  How much I weigh?  I weigh 285.  I'm about 5'10".  5'10". 
[02:00:00]  Okay.  That'll work.  And you're in the Baltimore National Pike where exactly?  That Circuit City on my way to visit my buddy Chester, who has a bit of a liver problem.  All right.  Hold on a second.  More Chester crap.  Rocco, where is the Circuit City exactly?  But it is.  If I am going, I believe it's eastbound.  It's on your left side.  It's right before 695.  What town?  What town? 
[02:00:30]  Cantonsville.  What kind of car?  Do you mean Catonsville?  Oh, what?  What kind of car?  A Nissan Altima.  Okay.  Oh, Buzz, you said that.  Right.  Did you mean Catonsville?  Catonsville.  Catonsville.  Cantonsville.  It is Catonsville, Maryland.  Yeah.  Are you an angry fat guy?  There you go.  Hey, hey, ass.  Guess what?  We got a delay.  Anything else you'd like to say?  Punching out.  Yeah, there you go.  Punching out.  Punching out.  See what happened here?  He hit the delay because the guy started mentioning our names and stuff.  Yeah, listen.  You could hear the phone call jump.  Anything else you'd like to say?  Punching out. 
[02:01:00]  Hold on, man.  Wait.  What happened, Opie?  Are you an angry fat guy?  There you go.  Hey, hey, ass.  Guess what?  We got a delay.  Anything else you'd like to say?  Punching out.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  That's a good guy.  That's a good guy.  That's a bright guy right there.  You know what that is?  That's a sign to me that Opie and Anthony are happening.  Absolutely.  They are happening.  They're as happening as yesterday's headlines.  Boys, you can have your prank callers, but they ain't getting through.  Bingo.  They ain't getting through.  They ain't getting through. 
[02:01:30]  They just got through, you idiot.  Please.  All we want is...  Joke about your dead dog.  Yeah.  One of our prank callers got through and talked about your dead dog, and now you're saying  Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  That's all we need.  There you go.  We want to make ourselves bigger, you idiots.  Thank you.  I love the way the other one got it.  Bingo.  Bingo.  That's everything that's wrong with that show.  Yesterday's headlines.  Yesterday's headlines.  Ha, ha, ha.  Bingo.  How are we yesterday's headlines?  All these jealous radio guys out there.  Well, because no one's making a big hullabaloo over us.  That's right.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yesterday's headlines. 
[02:02:00]  We were just on CBS Sunday morning.  It doesn't get bigger than that.  I don't know about that, and you can take that to the bank.  That's right.  Why don't you Google our names in news every day.  There's at least one or two things popping up with our names on it.  Well, yesterday's news.  Are you insane?  Bingo.  Yesterday's headlines.  Ha, ha, ha.  You know, no, no.  Why are you lying to your audience?  We've gotten huge press with our move to satellite radio.  Bingo.  I think he said bingo because bingo was his name.  Bingo was also a little dog.  B-I-N-G-O. 
[02:02:30]  B-I-N-G-O.  My wife is fucking crying again.  Was his name, oh.  That was awful.  It was bad.  Thank you, Bingo.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And keep raising the rates.  Yes.  For XM.  Keep raising the rates so your show will get out there.  So that maybe 25 more people will be able to hear it.  Very exciting.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We have 25 listeners.  25 already? 
[02:03:00]  The other day we had three, so we're doing well.  We're going up, up, up.  And all your listeners are in Philly.  You remember Philly, you fat fucks?  You were left naked and alone.  O&A were off the air, and you still got booted out of Philly.  Bombed.  For being yesterday's news, he knows exactly what's going on with us, with satellite radio.  We're getting knocked off the premium because it's a smart business move.  Don't you get it?  He gets it.  Yeah, raise the rates again.  What?  Huh? 
[02:03:30]  What?  No, they shouldn't raise the rates.  It should be free so you can hear 30 minutes of commercials and unfunny banter like you do on that program.  Right.  Awful.  We'll get out there so that maybe 25 more people will be able to hear it.  Very exciting.  And unlike me, see, I'm locked into that good rate for two years.  Unfortunately, that means I won't be able to hear the magic of ONA.  See, he's admitting he has XM Satellite Radio.  He's locked into a rate.  Right.  He thinks if you're locked into a rate that you won't have our program on the platform. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, we'll be readily available to everybody on the platform.  It doesn't matter when you sign up, what kind of rate you have.  Everyone will be able to listen to our show if they choose to.  Fat dope.  He's admitting that he listens to XM Satellite.  Of course he does.  For being yesterday's news, you know exactly what we're up to.  And you have the service.  What a shame.  The guys that are revolutionizing Satellite Radio.  You can pay extra and get them if you want.  Boy, oh boy.  They keep knocking on our door.  Hey, got a mic, Satellite Radio.  We're here with a truck full of money.  Come on over. 
[02:04:30]  Come on now.  It's happening.  Very exciting opportunity.  We say no.  Jesus.  That was not even a real fat guy.  Those guys are getting a plug-in for a Satellite Radio.  That was two hinky fat guys in a row.  All right.  They have not said no to Satellite Radio.  No one's making offers.  No one has made offers to you, you fat fuck.  You've done nothing but bomb in major markets, dude.  You've bombed in New York and Philly, two of the biggest markets in the country.  You got kicked out of both.  Don and Mike work for the same company as Howard Stern.  Everyone knows Howard Stern is leaving terrestrial radio at the end of the year. 
[02:05:00]  And Infinity's scrambling, trying to figure out who's going to replace Howard.  They're desperate.  And Don and Mike, if they had an actual show, they would be the obvious choice.  They would be the obvious choice, but they're not going to throw Don and Mike in a lot of markets.  They might throw him in one or two.  That's about it.  Maybe.  They might move him down to mornings in Washington where they do very, very well in the ratings.  But they failed everywhere else.  They failed in New York.  They failed in Philly.  Those are huge markets. 
[02:05:30]  They're not going to be in Boston when Howard leaves BCN.  They're not going to be in any of those big markets.  Joe Hollander from Infinity Broadcasting, little known fact, he's been talking to Anthony and I, but they can't figure it out.  And the other day in the press, he's saying that he's probably just going to go with a lot of local shows in all these markets.  So who's the failure?  Ouch.  You should have been the heir apparent, and you failed miserably.  Howard is leaving, and they're not moving you up.  And you have to look at your fat face in the mirror every morning and realize that. 
[02:06:00]  So say what you want.  You think if they would have succeeded in Philly, they might have had a shot.  They would have been proven as a stronger and a big market.  Or New York or any of the other many markets they were in that they just bombed.  And I love these people that keep downplaying satellite radio.  Oh, we're here, and it's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger.  As much as we ate Howard, I mean, Howard going to satellite is a huge move, obviously.  Ant and I, you know, we're no slacks ourselves.  We've gotten a lot of press over the last five, six years. 
[02:06:30]  Us being on satellite radio is a huge thing as well.  And all these people are in denial out there.  It's going to take over the whole fucking business.  These babies are all scrambling to regulate it because you've destroyed commercial radio,  and now you're crying about it.  They want it regulated because they know they're going to be screwed.  It's happening.  If your product is good, why do you have to worry about what this product's doing?  Oh, gosh.  And we know all the people they're contacting at XM.  And quite frankly, we knew all the people that they were contacting at the Little Doggy Company, too, 
[02:07:00]  when we were, quote, in bed with those guys for a while.  Don and Mike's names have never come up as far as going to satellite radio.  Don and Mike, please.  Hi, Don and Mike.  We may be this close to being able to make stuff invisible.  Cool.  They're working on a cloaking device at the University of Pennsylvania,  or as the guys with the pocket protectors like to call it, the plasmonic cover.  Are you serious?  Are you serious?  Are you serious at that?  Yeah, you make yourself invisible?  Oh.  Go to XM. 
[02:07:30]  Bingo.  Thank you.  You know how easy it is to get under this guy's skin?  You want to know how else you make yourself invisible?  Lie on the driveway at Don Geronimo's house.  Bravo.  Huzzah, Jimmy.  Do we have huzzah, Jimmy? 
[02:08:00]  Can I ring the bell?  Bravo.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Oh.  They're saying little Rudy was invisible when Don crushed him.  That's right.  Crushed the little life, the little lovable life out of him.  You late, selfish, fat pig.  You killed the one happy thing in that home.  And it gets to you, and you know it gets to you.  That day he called, he called you a radio show.  He's a relatively, he's a name in radio.  And he called this show on N.E.W.  just because he couldn't take the shit on. 
[02:08:30]  Do we have the call?  Couldn't take it.  He couldn't take it.  So he called me on the hotline, and he was trying to say how we're failing miserably when  we were syndicated to Washington.  And so I kept asking him, are we number one in afternoons?  Are we number one in afternoons?  And he goes, well, yeah, you are, but, and I just hung up on him, like, thank you, you  idiot.  He was so desperate.  He played right into our hands.  Why would you call another show and put yourself in that position?  Why?  You can't win.  Nope.  So.  Dope. 
[02:09:00]  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Well, he helped us out yesterday.  It's all about getting our names out there.  That's why we do the assault on the media, and we get our names on other shows, you know.  Yeah.  And the press does its job by mentioning us in every satellite radio article.  That's right.  Keep thinking that XM and satellite radio is going nowhere, you idiots.  You think Don really, like, really looks out his windows and stuff and around his vehicle  before he leaves now?  Imagine if he killed another one of his dogs. 
[02:09:30]  He must just, it must take him, like, ten minutes just to get out of the driveway now.  We know the guy a little bit.  He's so self-important.  And that guy saw dogs running all over his driveway and his front yard, and he just pulled  out.  Because it's all about him.  I trusted you.  You fat fuck.  He probably not.  He's one of those mirrors with a stick that they use to check for bombs when you're driving  into an airport.  Checks the wheel wells.  Make sure there's no little fellas.  All right.  Then he had to probably, like, you know, console his wife as she's crying on his shoulder. 
[02:10:00]  You know, he's still consoling.  He's still consoling, and that's why that caller really got to him.  Because he knows how upset his wife is about this whole thing.  She'll always deep down resent him for it because he's a clumsy, self-centered ass.  I can't listen to Don's show today because he's going to talk about Rudy.  Maybe you can't listen to it because he's the guy that killed your little Rudy.  And if Don was a smart radio guy, he would realize that you have completely wrecked his  radio show by being involved in it. 
[02:10:30]  Hi, boo-boo.  Ugh.  Yeah, I think Kingston did do that to Don's wife.  Boo-boo.  Ouch.  I'm almost positive, yeah.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Good morning, Sugartits.  Hi, Angel.  Please.  I just wanted to point out that when Don was busy cursing out the first caller, at the end,  Mike was actually saying, see you at the improv.  I don't know if it was a Jimmy reference, but if you rewind the tape, you'll be able to hear  that.  All right.  Hope you did.  Punch it out.  Thanks.  Were you able to get in a time machine and go back to the AAF days and just make that phone 
[02:11:00]  call from back in time?  Because I could swear that was you from that, hi, mom, I got caught jerking off at work  call.  I got a better one.  It sounded like Dan Aykroyd in Caddyshack 2.  One of the worst film characters ever.  Can you suck the poison out?  That was the worst.  He was pretty quirky, though, Aykroyd.  No, he stunk.  Quirky.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:11:30]  Well, we have a diary of a dead dog, but I think we need to explain this.  Wow.  Because maybe people didn't hear a diary of an unborn child.  Diary of an unborn child.  And then maybe people didn't hear about the Donna Mike thing.  Yeah.  Well, Donna Mike, who was Don's dog, he ran it over in the driveway.  Killed him.  Ran over little Rudy and killed him.  Little Rudy.  Arf!  Arf!  And he was a little distraught about that. 
[02:12:00]  He had to take a day off from work.  Yeah.  And his wife wrote some kind of, like, eulogy on the website about how much the dog meant  to them and stuff like that.  It was just awful.  And Don killed it.  Just ran it over.  Nice.  And then there was a diary of an unborn child, which was this, I don't know, monologue from  this unborn child, a fetus in the womb.  It's some people saying the funniest thing we've done since coming to XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:12:30]  And that bit is up on opianathlete.com and foundrymusic.com in case you missed it.  This little childlike voice talking about how it's growing in the womb and how it can't  wait to come out and see its mommy.  And see the world.  As an example, it says something like, you know, September 15th, my fingernails are growing.  It gives like a little blow-by-blow description of a child growing in the womb, waiting to  come out and meet its loving mommy.  And it turns out, just short of, you know, reaching its, I guess, third or fourth month 
[02:13:00]  or something like that, the mommy has an abortion.  And the little child inside just says, today, mommy killed me.  Right.  It comes out of the blue.  And then sings some morbid song about how mommy killed me.  It's fantastic.  It's an amazing, amazing bit that we did last week on the show.  But I guess somebody took both of those ideas, like peanut butter and chocolate, and put  them together, and made something more gooder.  Yeah.  This is called Diary of a Dead Dog. 
[02:13:30]  Uh-huh.  In honor of Don, whose real name is Mike.  Yeah.  In honor of Mike running over his little pet.  Yeah.  As he was leaving his driveway.  August 2002.  I'm a cute little puppy in a pet store on the Upper East Side of New York.  I'm a Cairn Terrier, and boy, am I cute.  September 2002.  I can't wait for a family to take me home.  Look at this lady.  I hope it's not her.  She looks like a real twat. 
[02:14:00]  Christmas 2002.  That fucking twat brought me home, and it sucks here.  I keep hearing two words.  Career and failure.  February 2003.  It's Valentine's Day, and the fat fuck named Mike still hasn't brushed his teeth.  I think I'll shit on his pillow.  September 2003.  I hate it here.  I've been here for seven dog years.  Nothing works here.  The mouthwash doesn't work. 
[02:14:30]  Thanksgiving 2003.  I'd rather lick my ass than kiss Mike.  Did I mention they named me Rudy after the mayor of New York?  These people are dumber than the ball I chase.  March 2004.  That cunt had my ball sack cut off.  October 2004.  I despise these freaks.  I just ass-fucked clink.  That'll teach them to eat my kibble.  February 2005.  I'm running away.  They'll never find me, and I'll be happy with a family that doesn't suck ass. 
[02:15:00]  March 2005.  You killed me.  You ran me over because you were late for work.  You'll burn in hell.  I trust in you, you fat fuck.  I trust in you, you fat fuck.  Oh, very funny.  Bravo.  Whoever set that in. 
[02:15:30]  I'd give you credit, but it's not in front of me.  The Diary of a Dead Dog.  That's hilarious.  P-Niggity?  P-Niggity did that, huh?  Another P-Niggity creation, huh?  P-Niggity.  Very funny.  I'm not.  Nothing worse here.  The mouthwash doesn't work.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  You didn't wake up like Ben today.  Ben isn't in today.  Why isn't Ben in? 
[02:16:00]  He called me.  I got up at like...  I was up at like 3.30 this morning,  and the phone's ringing.  It's Ben saying that he's just shitting like he's never shit before.  And he says,  I would rather deal with this at home than at work.  I'm like, yeah, whatever, dude,  because we don't want to deal with it.  Is he flinging his windows open in his bathroom?  Is that frigid cold in there?  He's sweating more than usual.  His head's sweating.  He's on the toilet.  His legs are shaking.  Stupid glasses are askew. 
[02:16:30]  Poor Ben.  Awful Boston dumps.  His big hog is resting in the toilet water.  Lazily hanging in there.  He takes a nice chowder shit.  The bottom of his balls are just brushing up against the water.  I don't know why, and I'll admit it,  but Jim and I are obsessed with Ben's hog.  We're trying to figure out what the hell's going on in the front of his pants.  We've said this many times, but for the new listeners,  we don't know if he has just really big balls or he's got just an enormous hog. 
[02:17:00]  It really is.  You can't not look at it when he bobbles in the studio with his messy hair.  He's a very hairy guy, perhaps.  It's just a lot of hair.  In a disarray, like on his head.  Ben's a mess.  Now he's crapping.  What's the update with Ben?  He still won't come on the phone?  God, he's going to be in bad shape today.  Anyway, um...  He won't come to the phone?  Ben is very, very sick.  I just got done talking to him. 
[02:17:30]  I explained to him that you'd like to get him on the air,  but he said, I can't.  I can't even get out of bed.  He said it's bad sushi, he thinks.  Oh, really?  Oh, never good.  Yeah, yeah.  He had some sushi last night.  He can't move.  He's...  Bad sushi.  Yeah, he's running to the bathroom every ten minutes.  And Ben never gets sick, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Ben never gets sick.  So if he's out, it's bad.  Is he puking or dumping?  I think it's both.  Ugh.  All right.  That's why I'm always paranoid about sushi, but everybody thinks I'm nuts.  Yeah, same.  I know everybody, everyone I know has had bad sushi at one time. 
[02:18:00]  I eat sushi all the time.  I got sick once, and it was because I went to one of these stupid lunch places that advertised  half-priced sushi.  Oh, dude.  It was years ago.  I learned my lesson.  Yeah.  And I brought the sushi home, and it tasted bad right away, so I stopped eating it.  So I didn't get that sick, not like a Ben.  And then I decided to try to feed it to my cats at the time, and the cats wouldn't eat it.  If the cats won't eat sushi, I'm like, bad sign. 
[02:18:30]  I am in deep ass.  Deep ass.  And were you?  Oh, yeah.  And that was just from, I think I ate one piece.  I shoveled it in laughing and giggling, not thinking.  Dude, I'm fucking gossiping and having a great time.  I was with Bono, hanging out with Bono.  Yeah.  Dude, shoving it down his gullet.  My worst experience, I was going to the beach, Robert Moses or something, out there on Long  Island, and went to one of the delis, got myself a nice ham and Swiss on a roll with 
[02:19:00]  mustard.  Nice, right?  Ah, yeah.  And then a side order of potato salad.  Mmm, potato salad.  Nice little whatever, you know, quarter ounce or half ounce, whatever.  First of all, let me chastise you for potato salad on the beach.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  You don't take it to the beach.  Took it to the beach.  I remember it was about 100 degrees.  Yeah, nice baking in the sun, mayonnaise, egg.  And maybe an hour or two later, I finally decide to get to my potato salad.  Good choice.  That was very, very mayonnaise-y. 
[02:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  And I ate the thing.  And then I had to go out east to have dinner with my brother.  And to make a long story short, it got so bad, the diarrhea, that I was dry heaving from  my butt.  Nothing else would come out, but I was still contracting.  Like it was just opening up and puckering.  Yeah.  It was like...  Looked like a horse after they're done.  When a horse is finished, but it's still like the muscles are still going.  It must have been so bad that my body was saying, look, we don't know what's still left 
[02:20:00]  in here, but we're going to still try to get it out.  You don't think Ben has the flu, do you?  I don't think so.  He probably just ate Ben's.  Oh, there you go.  Something to be paranoid about.  Great.  I'm just making sure.  Looks like Grandma's lips.  Come kiss Grandma.  Yeah.  All right.  Poor Ben.  I feel bad for the little messy-haired little guy.  The little awful body.  The little fella.  Well, let's get into some show stuff.  Glasses all askew, fogging up from the heat coming off of his body. 
[02:20:30]  He's got a bucket in his lap, puking and shitting at the same time.  And that's a tough thing to do.  Yeah.  You don't know where to go.  You flip around.  Do you get the garbage bucket and sit there?  Or do you...  Do you ever puke and shit at the same time?  No.  Can't say it happened.  Well, same thing happened with the potato salad.  I know some people that have.  Thank God, right next to the sink.  Because how else do you figure that one out?  I've heard stories of people that go to woof.  They go into the toilet, and it shoots out on the wall behind them. 
[02:21:00]  It's a hysterical image, but I wouldn't want to be there.  You just brought back a memory, man.  Gee, really?  Sorry to hear that.  From the frat house.  We had this disgusting pig of a guy.  He was a fat guy.  I don't want to say his name.  The guy would get so hammered, and then he would have explosive diarrhea.  And for some reason, he needed to sleep naked in the TV room with a blanket.  Jesus.  And I guess... 
[02:21:30]  Why didn't you tell the guy?  Knock it off.  Whatever.  He's, you know, you're in your room, whatever, whatever.  I mean, you know, these guys would come home at 4 or 5 in the morning, whatever they want  to do.  Ugh.  And he...  I guess he would be so drunk, he would just take his clothes off.  Like, he had no idea what was going on.  He's one of these guys.  Yeah.  And we actually found crap on the walls all over the couch.  Like, he had explosive...  His ass exploded, like, all over the TV room.  And instead of, like, the rest of us getting pissed off, we were just amazed. 
[02:22:00]  Like, how the F...  Wow.  Just crapped all over the walls.  Yeah.  What position do you have to be in to get crapped, like, I don't know, 5 feet up on a wall?  And then the guy's apologizing because he doesn't remember anything.  Of course not.  The only Anthony show.  Do we have an update on poor Ben?  Ben's very sick.  Both phones are off and dumping both into voicemail.  Is he sleeping, you think?  Oh, wow.  I think so.  I think he's in a lot of pain.  I wish he was in here.  We should have spun him in a circle.  Oh.  He's puking and crapping his brains out because he ate bad sushi. 
[02:22:30]  That's what we're hearing.  Yeah.  The reports are in.  Hopefully we'll get an update tomorrow.  Usually that's a 24-hour thing, right?  You got the bad sushi?  Dude, I was fucking...  I bet he can't even be herky-jerky today.  He's probably like...  Oh, the second he herks or jerks, he craps himself.  He's only herky-ing.  Like a doll that's running out of batteries.  His messy hair is all matted down with sweat over his eyes.  Tippy Tom underwear. 
[02:23:00]  The poor guy.  Oh, he's a mess.  He's more of a mess than usual.  Poor little Ben.  Poor Ben.  His little hedgehog body all curled up in a ball as he shivers.  He can't get the sheet to cover his big cock.  Keeps flopping over the side of the bed.  Hits the floor.  Yeah.  All that body hair shedding on his bed sheets.  As he shivers.  Making a little hole in his mattress like a den.  For him to just lay in.  Sweating in it. 
[02:23:30]  Leaning over the bed just vomiting into his bucket.  Every time he sneezes, he has to change the sheets.  Because he's shitting onto his nice bed.  Shoot.  Flarks.  I bet you when he's in the bathroom, he looks like toothpaste being squeezed from the middle.  Just both ends shooting some type of vile, smelly liquid.  We now go inside Ben's bathroom. 
[02:24:00]  God bless me, dude.  That's insane.  That's nuts.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Call back to yesterday.  Oh, that's crazy.  That's nuts.  That's insane, dude.  Dude, my friend in Boston.  As he's clapping.  He's clapping and hurting.  He's puking and shitting. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, bad sushi.  Boy, the bowl's glowing.  Poor Ben.  That big head.  It's hard to get it completely over the toilet.  Because when he bends over, his skull hits the lid.  So he pukes half on the front of the seat and half in the bowl. 
[02:25:00]  He has to go sideways so that big head doesn't hit the fucking, the upturned lid.  He's clanking the septic tank.  Clank.  You hate when you're sitting there like, nothing came out.  I go, you prepare for your abs to hurt. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, and it just is aching.  That poor Ben.  He's been wiping his ass since 4 o'clock in the morning.  It probably feels like a nice raw, like he rubbed a piece of a potato chip in between.  Like a sour cream and onion potato chip in between his tender ass cheeks.  It's all red and sore.  First time his abs have felt any kind of workout.  Yeah.  He's going to come in with a six pack.  Abs.  All buff.  Little short arms.  Ben's a disaster.  That's why he can't comb his hair.  His arms are too short. 
[02:26:00]  That poor guy's at home suffering.  Yeah, poor little T-Rex body.  He can't even.  Tries to comb it, but he's herking and jerking, so his hair goes all over the place.  He probably wipes his ass by rubbing it on the rug like a dog does.  It's called scooting.  He's scoot on the rug.  Oh, dude.  Oh, poor guy.  Liquidy, awful dump.  Oh, you know it's just a bad day for him at home.  I'd like to see that guy from Pennsylvania giving it to Ben in his dumper while he's puking.  He can't even shit. 
[02:26:30]  He's so filled to the rim with shame.  He's being brutally raped on the radio.  Wow.  And Ben hates when we talk about his personal stuff or his cock.  Oh, I know.  I can't stop talking about it.  I wish he was here.  He hates it.  Yeah.  Oh, that bathroom.  Who's going to clear?  Does he have a maid or something?  I hope so.  A street team of some sort.  A street team.  Looks like he threw a Yoo-Hoo into the ceiling fan.  Someone's got to clean that up. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, that's fucking hilarious.  My second chocolate beverage joke of the day.  And they're both gems.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, that's funny.  It's dripping onto his rug.  Oh, I hope his whole apartment is ruined with his shit and vomit.  I hope he puked into every electronic component he has.  Dude, I got shit in my cell phone. 
[02:27:30]  I don't know.  Poor guy.  The only thing that would make me happier is if I could lift up his sheet and cut one  of my vile farts and then watch his sweaty forehead be too sick to get up and just vomit.  And spray Lysol.  He can't do anything.  He's going to puke like the exorcist.  Just lay there and vomit pee soup into your pillow.  Powerless.  Oh, the poor son of a bitch.  That's awful.  Steve, any...  Just talked to Ben. 
[02:28:00]  He's on his way to the doctor, I believe.  Oh, is he listening?  Yeah, he's listening.  He said, is it you that keeps trying to call me?  Knock it off.  Is he feeling a little bit better?  Not really.  Knock it off to the doctor.  He's in bed.  He can't stop sweating.  Can we call out?  So he's back to normal.  That's good.  When can he sweat?  He's one of those guys that would be the polar swimmers who would sweat when he gets  out of the little hole in the ice.  Who's that guy ice fishing naked, sweating?  He's going to the doctor.  Yeah.  So he sounds serious now. 
[02:28:30]  He's fine.  He doesn't sound like he's in good shape.  Has he been taking Pepto-Bismol or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just want to say hi to him real fast.  He won't.  He sees the number on the cell phone and he just won't pick it up.  And then he calls my other cell and he goes, stop it.  What does he think is?  Earl?  Yeah.  That sound etiquette?  Oh, God.  Is that funny?  I want him to hold the phone by the bowl while he's releasing.  That's what I want to hear.  Definitely.  Ben isn't that kind of guy, though.  Not at all.  He doesn't like it.  He's very embarrassed by it.  He's very private about it.  His bodily functions.  His bodily functions. 
[02:29:00]  I remember when we were doing dump stories, he was very uncomfortable.  Very uncomfortable.  He opens the door or the window in the bathroom here and freezes everybody out.  I'll bet you when he was a kid, he was known as Big Doody's Ben.  I'll bet you in kindergarten, he clogged a couple of toilets or he stood up and had  the type of logs that were poking up through the seat and the other boys and girls noticed,  hey, it's Big Doody's Ben.  Stuck with him and gave him a complex.  That's why he sweats so much.  He's always nervous and they're going to stick up and give him away. 
[02:29:30]  They're going to think of my little name that they gave me and taunt me with it.  Big Doody's Ben.  Carlos from Long Island.  Ben's A-hole looks like the back of the Batmobile.  That's good.  I thought I had a cute little story to start the show today, but Jimmy trumped me. 
[02:30:00]  Oh.  Well, your story, I'm sure your story's cute and nice.  Is it similar?  Well, I got action, too.  I called Anthony.  I had him laughing so freaking hard.  Action.  Well, I told you that on Friday that, you know, I finally had to go to the doctor for this. 
[02:30:30]  Jimmy just starts laughing immediately.  That is exactly the same thing, by the way.  You go there and then you call and tell your partner exactly what happened.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, Anthony, I got a story for you.  Are you ready?  I love you.  Are you ready, Ant?  This is what's going to turn you on.  Yeah.  This is going to help our relationship.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Uh, yeah, you know, I've been talking about it off and on about the constipation, so I  went to the doctor.  My doctor that I've been, you know, with for like six or seven years. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, my doctor, Vinnie Boombat.  Because, you know, it was getting so bad, I was getting really bad headaches from time to  time and all those toxins backing up.  Toxins backing up.  And then I was getting like a, a slight like, a slight like, um, kind of like, uh, heartburn.  Yeah.  Type of thing.  And that's what made me really nervous.  So I went to the doctor.  He hooked me up to an EKG immediately.  I'm like, dude, just, you know, make sure the EKG's cool, which it was.  You're just, you're just backing up.  Yeah, backing up bad.  I'm going in for a full physical in two weeks, but, but all the symptoms were, yeah, you're 
[02:31:30]  just really constipated.  Because he's asking me, I'm like, dude, sometimes I go two, three days without even going.  And he's like, that's what's going on, man.  And you're, and then he, he felt around my abdomen and stuff.  I was like, wow, man, you got a lot in there.  Big Adobe factory.  Oh, yeah.  So I was very relieved that we were able to figure it out.  Very relieved.  You know, he's like, yeah, the headaches are from the toxins building up most likely.  Uh, you know, but he did a couple of little tests just to make sure on that.  And then he checked the, you know, the EKG for the heart. 
[02:32:00]  He's like, yeah, your heart looks really good.  And then, uh, you know, he's feeling around the abdomen.  He's like, yeah, you're right.  You diagnosed yourself perfectly.  I'm like, and all, I'm all relieved.  Right.  And then he's like, you know, you need to start taking some Metamucil or whatever.  Metamucil.  And then, and then something called a softener.  Oh, God.  It's just, it's called a softener.  Softener.  He doesn't believe in laxatives, but he believes in these softeners.  Softener.  Because he was asking me, you know, what kind of, when, when, when I do go, how bad it is. 
[02:32:30]  I'm like, dude, it's like concrete.  It's thin.  It's just, it's just awful.  You know, he goes, oh, you need softeners.  Here's the three I recommend, right?  You don't want Haagen-Dazs in the freezer for a week.  You want Carvel's softener.  Right.  So, then I get up off his little, you know, table slash, whatever you call that, the examining  freaking thing.  And I'm all relieved, and I'm pretty much getting ready to head out the door.  And he goes, but I just want to make sure. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, no.  I thought I was, you know, home free.  I thought I was home free, man.  I'm like, what do you mean?  Like the hostage.  You go home today.  What do you mean?  Dress you up, take you out to the car, and then go, not today.  I go, what do you mean you want to make sure?  And that's when, I wish I had some dramatic music.  I forgot to tell Eric to load that today.  Do you have the, uh, any psycho music or anything like that?  Might have something.  Might have something good?  All right.  You all loaded it?  I don't know if this will work, but, and that's when. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, yeah, that'll work.  So, uh, I'm heading toward the door.  He goes, uh, well, I just want to make sure, you know.  I'm like, what does that mean?  And I turn, because I'm sort of out the door.  Yeah.  Like, I'm reaching for the handle, and I turn.  And that's when I see, with his back turned to me.  Putting on the glove.  Not the glove.  And then it's going through your head.  What other things could he use the glove for? 
[02:34:00]  Can't be just that.  And then he knows it's awkward.  You know, he knows, he knows who I, who I am, which I think makes it a little, little,  little stranger for him, you know.  O.P.?  Right.  By the way, when I went into the doctor's office, I got to back up just a little bit.  The, um, one of the ladies that works there, she's about, you know, in her early 30s, I  guess.  She works at the office.  She can't believe I'm there.  She's freaking out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fan of the show.  I listen to you and Anthony every morning. 
[02:34:30]  And I'm like, so you were listening this morning.  She goes, yes.  And I'm like, so you know I'm here because I can't crap.  She's like, yes.  And I'm like, oh, this is just great.  You know?  So then he's reaching for the glove, and he can't even look at me.  He's like, of course not.  He's like, all right, just drop your pants.  I'm like, doc, no way.  I go, you know I'm going to have to talk about this on the air.  He goes, you better not.  I'm like, I have to.  Are you kidding me?  So he's like, drop your jeans and your, you know, your undies.  And then he goes, all right, lean, lean forward. 
[02:35:00]  Dude, I can't even look him in the eye.  I'm like, lean forward.  I understand because I can't even look you in the eye when you're saying this.  He goes, lean forward, lean on your elbows, and take a deep breath.  Here it comes.  What are you doing, motherfucker?  What are you doing, motherfucker? 
[02:35:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God damn.  That's bad.  Oh, my God. 
[02:36:00]  Thank you.  You asses.  So please continue with this testimony from the Colby trial. 
[02:36:30]  So then I, when last we left you, you were bent over, taking a deep breath.  And so I, yeah, I lean over on my elbows, and I'm in, I guess I'm in the position.  I guess I'm in the ideal position.  And it was pretty much like Chevy Chase and Fletch, you know, it was time to sing Moon River.  This is a giant cock.  He goes, all right, take a deep breath.  I took a deep breath. 
[02:37:00]  He goes, exhale, and then, oof.  And then it happened.  Oh.  Then it happened.  And then he has to do, I'm sure, the old doctor joke when he was done.  He goes, I hope I didn't change your lifestyle.  And I'm like, oh, God.  And then, you know, he goes, all clear.  I'm like, oh, gee, thanks.  All clear.  And then I pull up my jeans.  All clear.  And all of a sudden, now he has his back turned to me again, and he's washing off in  the sink and taking off the glove. 
[02:37:30]  And I felt like such an idiot.  Because you're just standing there by yourself.  Now you're going to lean over and clean the load off your shoe by yourself.  I was worried about all that crap.  I didn't feel any of that.  Because I've heard rumors about that shit, right?  Oh, prostate?  Yeah.  You get the prostate tickled a little, and you're dumping.  Oh, God.  Not dumping, dumping.  You're dumping a load.  Stop.  But I was relieved that, you know, none of that was going on. 
[02:38:00]  I'm like, all right.  That would be perfect.  I got audio of the moment.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's actually audio of the doctor. 
[02:38:30]  So, of course, as soon as I leave the damn place, I got to call my pal.  I'm like, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm not a virgin anymore.  Oh, you took it.  Anthony starts laughing his ass off.  Did it hurt?  Was there pain?  It was just really...  I can't really describe it.  It was kind of just uncomfortable.  I would assume it would be uncomfortable.  It didn't hurt, per se. 
[02:39:00]  There wasn't any real pain?  No, it's just a very uncomfortable thing.  Oh, it certainly sounds like it would be.  Oh, God.  It gives you the feeling that you need to dump.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, move.  So, there you have it.  XM202.  I have a confession to make, Anthony.  Oh.  My ass is starting to get violated.  Look, one time...  I have a confession.  Look, one time I understand. 
[02:39:30]  It happens to everybody.  But this is becoming ridiculous.  Effing ridiculous.  Well, I know what you were talking about a couple of weeks ago.  Well, I like teasing it like that,  so, you know, maybe a few of our listeners just drove off the road  going, what the fuck is going on with that idiot?  You got the finger.  You got the finger.  The gloved finger of the doctor.  And I got it again.  What?  So, now I'm starting to think there's something going on with the doctor.  It was the same doctor?  I'm starting to think. 
[02:40:00]  Wait a minute.  If it's the same doctor,  can't he remember what he was feeling around for last time?  Well, let me...  Why did he need another?  Let me back up.  So, uh...  Yeah, back up into the doctor's finger.  That's what you've been doing.  Moon River!  Uh...  Remember, I had the problem with the crapping and all that.  How can we forget?  So, I went to the doctor for that,  and that's when I got the initial, uh...  Hey, I'm not a virgin anymore.  Hey, now!  Yeah, there it is. 
[02:40:30]  So, uh...  And then I set up my physical,  because it's been a while.  Uh-huh.  So, my physical was Friday,  even though I was in the middle of a respiratory infection,  strep throat,  and also a heavy cold coming on.  So, I go back to Long Island to go to my doctor's office,  get my physical,  and, uh...  And he was very happy with everything,  besides, you know,  my stupid illness that I had.  And then, uh...  I'm getting up.  He gives me all sorts of meds for this and that,  for stupid stuff, 
[02:41:00]  and, uh...  And all of a sudden, he goes, uh...  One more thing.  And I'm thinking...  Oh, not one more thing.  But that's what he said last time.  And I'm thinking,  well, what could he possibly want this time?  You did this already.  No, because I didn't know at that point.  He goes, uh...  Well, I already had my pants dropped,  because I had to do the famous cough thing.  And I don't know why they make you turn to the left.  What is that about?  I think that's plain and simple, 
[02:41:30]  so you don't cough in his face.  Oh, really?  Or in his general direction.  I don't think it has anything to do with  what he's feeling for.  Oh, I always thought it was because, uh...  He doesn't want you seeing that he's actually enjoying  the process.  That's what I always thought as a kid.  Really?  You know, make sure there's no eye contact whatsoever,  because it's such an awkward situation.  Guy drops his pants,  has to turn to the left.  What, the doctor, you know,  has two fingers,  and then you cough to make sure you don't have a hernia  or something? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, he, like,  takes two fingers and puts them under your ball bag.  Right.  And then you cough,  and somehow he's feeling if something is,  you know, pulling wrong or something.  But you're turning the head,  and I think that's just so you're not coughing  in the doctor's face.  I gotta tell you.  In his general direction.  Very early on,  I was very suspicious of that whole thing.  Yeah.  In school, grammar school,  whenever it starts.  That was the worst.  Do they still do that in school?  That is the worst.  Because, you know,  puberty hasn't hit yet.  Usually it's,  usually it's a nurse.  Really? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I think in,  I think in my school,  maybe they did,  I don't know now.  Whatever.  It's just,  it's just,  a guy doctor sitting there  with lines of young hairless boys  stepping up to him  so he could touch their sack.  What an amusement park that is for a pedo.  See, and I'm convinced that,  you know,  gynecologists go into it  because,  hey,  they're somewhere down in their psyche,  they're pervs.  Right.  I'm convinced of that.  And you could call and say,  yeah,  dude,  you don't understand 
[02:43:00]  what we have to look at every day.  No, man.  You're looking at all the old ladies  and the messes  hoping for that 17,  16 year old  coming in for her first visit.  Who are you kidding?  I've never done this before.  Yeah.  All the medicine you can practice,  you choose vag medicine.  Stop.  Yeah,  you want to help people?  A lot of people have bad feet.  Right.  Why don't you become a foot doctor?  Oh,  well,  the foot doctor thing is that,  that's obvious too.  You think that's a fetish?  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah,  who else would that?  Without a doubt.  You're going through medical school 
[02:43:30]  and they finally go,  so decide what kind of medicine  you want to,  you choose.  The foot.  We all are,  not what,  yeah,  we're all perverts  and sexual deviants  deep down in our psyche  and even though it's your profession,  you're thinking,  well,  I'm going to make a living  as a doctor  and I just happen to have  this foot fetish thing happening.  So I could cover up all of those.  Yeah,  I'm going to be a podiatrist?  What explains the proctologist?  The asshole doctor.  That's,  what the hell,  who goes into that? 
[02:44:00]  Going,  yeah,  proctology,  that's,  that's where I want to go.  Right.  Because you know damn well,  like,  I don't know,  any other doctor,  you could pretty much make  the same amount of money  as the ass doctor.  So you're not into it,  you're not getting into that specialty  just for money.  Anthony,  we all have dreams growing up.  Yeah.  You're going through school,  what do you want to be?  I want to be an astronaut.  Yeah.  So it's the same thing  with choosing  what kind of medicine you want to,  you know,  practice.  Yeah.  So if you're choosing ass, 
[02:44:30]  or foot,  or vag,  Yeah.  that was your first choice.  Because it's your fetish.  Right.  Yeah,  you're going to school.  I'm a horn dog,  I'm,  you know,  this is not Opie talking by the way,  because I know how you assholes  make promos.  I'm a horn dog,  I'm bisexual,  I'll be an ass doctor.  Right.  Covers all bases.  Certainly does.  I make money,  I could use my degree,  and look at man ass all day long.  And look at man ass all day. 
[02:45:00]  You tell me it's different than that.  It can't be,  because anybody going to medical school  can go,  look,  I want to make a lot of money,  I'm going to be a brain surgeon,  I'm going to be a heart doctor,  I'm going to specialize in,  you know,  the lungs,  or the nervous system,  something,  anything,  but,  you know,  I'm going to medical school,  I want ass all day long.  You think plastic surgeons  aren't horndogs,  knowing that they're going to,  that too,  look at boobs all day?  Uh-huh.  If you're,  excuse me,  a regular family doctor, 
[02:45:30]  or a cardiologist,  or some kind of specialist,  yes,  but as soon as you start saying,  no,  I want to look at vag all day,  I want to look at assholes all day,  I want to look at feet all day,  you chose this.  You chose that,  and it goes back to something  that's going on with you sexually,  without a doubt.  Uh-huh.  Guaranteed.  That's true.  I believe that.  I believe that anyone in that field,  gynecology,  proctology,  you have to be some kind of perv  that's into that kind of thing. 
[02:46:00]  So when you go there  and think it's all professional,  and this doctor's a professional,  I know it's a little awkward.  Yeah,  I'll throw that on the table.  Do they,  you know,  look at their jobs  in a professional manner?  Of course.  Most of them,  definitely.  But there's a part  way back in their head  that doesn't come out  that you'll never know,  but they're looking at you like,  wow,  look at that.  So do you think  that like a gyno  is sitting there  and he looks out  into his waiting room  and he sees like 
[02:46:30]  some old bag,  she's in there,  and you know,  that doesn't do anything to him.  That is pretty much,  and I'm just talking  generally here,  that's pretty much  like his work.  That's what he  goes to work to do.  Right.  But then if he looks out  in that waiting room  and sees the,  you know,  the teen girl  who's in there  for her first exam,  he's got to go,  this is why  I picked gynecology.  We are,  our profession  is so close  to being a gynecologist  is not even funny. 
[02:47:00]  Let me explain.  On a daily basis,  ah,  yeah.  Daily basis,  do we not look outside  that studio door  wondering what's around?  Of course.  If we have girls  that are coming in  and they're expected  to come in that day  to do something,  we're looking around,  and then when they arrive,  we go,  how do they look?  Are they good?  And when they're not hot,  it's like,  ah,  now,  we're professionals.  We'll make every girl,  you know,  sound like she's  the hottest piece of ass  ever.  They'll come in here  and do what they  were supposed to do.  We won't chase them away. 
[02:47:30]  Hence,  sometimes the photo's  not making it up  on the website.  There you go.  Sometimes the video,  maybe Steve didn't have  enough time  to get it up there.  Yeah,  that's it.  That's how good we are.  And sometimes it's on  before the segment's  even over.  That's right.  But the reality is,  we'll have to go  through some messes  understanding that  every once in a while  there's some young,  gorgeous piece of ass  that just decides  she needs to be  naked in front of her.  There's a gold nugget  rolling itself in here  sometimes.  Just like the gynecologist.  Just like the gynecologist. 
[02:48:00]  It has to be.  You're right.  That waiting room  filled with  three or four ladies  with, you know,  pussy cancer.  Oh, God.  You cannot use  the clinical jargon  here, Opie.  I'm sorry,  Mrs. Johnson.  You have pussy cancer.  And one  mom with her  young daughter  sitting there  just to get  her first  cat smear.  All nervous,  fidgety,  looking like  Britney Spears. 
[02:48:30]  Who are you kidding?  Let me warm  this speculum  up for you.  And you don't think  the doctor organizes  a little bit?  Let me think.  Hey, how you doing?  I'll look at  old pussy cancer  for the first  couple hours  and just before lunch  I'll take the  Britney Spears  look-alike  and then go to lunch.  A segment when  he's got a lot of time.  Hell yeah.  So he can spend  a lot of time in there.  Fuck yeah.  So, how's he?  Are you sexually active?  He gets to ask  other questions.  Okay, I'm going to do  a breast exam on you 
[02:49:00]  now too.  He gets to feel her up.  And then, of course,  he's like,  don't be nervous.  You know, he's all  professional, but inside  he's like, oh my god,  look at those tits!  Look at her.  You know, and he's got  to talk to her a little  at first, and then he  gets to that point  where he's got to be  professional and go,  okay, disrobe.  Right.  You know, he's just  shaken.  At that point he looks  and then turns just so  he can go, oh my god.  Oh my god, I can't  believe this is why I'm  in this line of work. 
[02:49:30]  And then he turns around  and gets whatever he  does to, you know,  the speculum.  He takes the speculum.  But as he's turning  his back, you know  he's in his head going,  oh my god, oh my god,  keep calm, keep calm,  keep calm.  Breathe, breathe, breathe,  breathe.  All right, turn back  around.  All right, so,  what we're going to do  here.  Oh my goodness.  Oh my goodness.  But the same is true  with the feet and the  assholes.  But the bad part is  that, you know,  the rest of his day  is spent looking at  London broil with an 
[02:50:00]  afro.  I don't know about that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You think they enjoy  that too?  I bet the odds are  much better than you  think.  I bet you the odds  are pretty good.  I don't know.  I think most of the  day sucks for the  guy I know.  and occasionally  there's the gold  nugget.  But I think most of  the day there's  probably women that  are really out of  shape that have  problems down there.  That's why they're  there.  It's not the,  this is my first  exam.  I hope it's easier 
[02:50:30]  for you to examine.  I shave it all off  so it's easier for  you.  I'm really nervous.  Are you sexually  active?  Once.  Right.  Just a blowjob.  I hope it doesn't  hurt because you  can barely slide  a credit card  through it.  That's like his  gold nugget day.  But for the most  part it's,  hi doc,  I'm back.  It hasn't gone  away.  Oh.  All right,  get on the wax 
[02:51:00]  paper.  I guess today's not  the day that I get  to see the hot  piece of ass.  Who's coming in?  Oh, it's two  gloves Sarah.  We call her that  because I have to  snap on two gloves.  Yeah, you know  they know her  around.  I think there's a  whole like sexual  perverted thing  going on and I'm  convinced.  Even the bad ones  are good?  Well, here's the  other side of it.  I'm convinced of  this too.  I think there's  women that get so  turned on by going  to their gynecologist 
[02:51:30]  whether it's a woman  or a man that  they're making  visits and  appointments they  probably don't  really need.  And they get  completely turned on  sitting there as a  doctor's examining them.  Oh, without a doubt.  Any time I've heard  a gaggle of girls  yapping about it  they always talk  about how it's  very uncomfortable.  I'm not talking  about the average  girl.  I'm talking about  some girls enjoy  it.  Yeah, I'm talking  about it's probably  a very, very  small percentage.  But I think the  doctor even knows  but what is he  going to do?  It's money, he's  doing his job, but 
[02:52:00]  he probably knows  the lady's sitting  there.  Can you take a  look at this?  Doc, I think  there's a problem.  Could you spread  the stirrups wider  apart and really  get a good look  up there?  I think you  might need to  get closer.  No, it's back  into the left  right about there.  That works  because it's all  chicks coming in.  All women.  But now the  proctologist.  What if you're  into chicks'  asses?  That sounds 
[02:52:30]  good because the  chicks are coming  in and having  their ass checked  out.  Although unlike a  gyno where girls  that are perfectly  healthy go in to  make sure they're  okay, the ass  doctor, I don't  think a lot of  young girls are  going there just  to say, take a  look, is my  ass okay?  No, I'm telling  you when the  hot young girl  goes into the  ass doctor, the  ass doctor in  general is going,  eww.  What do you  mean?  Doesn't dig it?  No.  You think all  ass doctors are  there for the  guys?  Yeah.  Wow.  That is a bold  statement.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  All proctologists  are gay and  that's why they  got into it, to  look at man  ass.  When girls come  in, it's awful.  And the girl's  all nervous and  the girl has  nothing to worry  about.  That doctor  doesn't want to  see your brown  eye.  He's just in a  hairy man  ass.  Yeah.  Wow.  You are really  going out on a  ledge here.  I've thought about  this many, many  times.  Just for guys.  In between games  of solitaire.  Because I'm  thinking if the  guy is into  chicks bungs, he's 
[02:53:30]  into the bung  hole of chicks, you  get into that line  of work, but then  you're not saying  that one guy that  is into girls ass  became a  proctologist and  then has to deal  with man ass all  day just to get  that occasional  good one.  It's simple.  Yeah.  It's so simple.  Ass doctors have  to look at both  guys and girls.  Right.  Gynos, all  vag.  All chicks.  All vag.  So, just think  about your life.  You want to be an  ass doctor.  Yeah.  But I'm saying  you're not doing 
[02:54:00]  it to look at  girls asses.  Because you know  you're going to  have to look at  guys asses.  That's true, but  what if you're so  hung up on girls  bungles?  No way.  That's like, now  right there you  get to...  No way.  No.  No.  Yeah, the bad  definitely outweighs  the good.  That's what I'm  saying.  So, if the bad  outweighs the good,  you've got to  think he's more  into, you know,  guys asses.  And a gay guy  isn't going to be  as grossed out  at a girl's ass  as a straight guy  would be for a  guy's ass.  Yeah, all day  long.  Oh, God. 
[02:54:30]  All day long.  Good God.  Yeah, that's awful.  Let's go to  Karen in New Jersey.  I didn't even get to  the end of my story  here.  Karen, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Yes, Karen.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up, Karen?  Very good.  Listen, I was  calling to tell you  I worked in a  gynecologist's office  and it's nothing  but old ladies.  Occasionally, maybe  once a day, you'll  get an attractive  woman in there.  That's what he's  gunning for.  Old ladies.  All day long.  That's what he's  gunning for, though.  You think the used  car salesman is 
[02:55:00]  seeing one young  snatch a day?  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  All I know is this  old, dirty, nasty,  women, and they  do anal exams, too.  Really?  It's not just all  vag.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, Karen.  No problem.  I still go with  my theory, though,  because every other  guy out there that  has a normal job  doesn't get to see  one young vag a day.  That's true.  If you could get  a job tomorrow that  says you get to see  one young vag a day 
[02:55:30]  and they don't tell  you anything else  that's going to  happen with your job,  you're signing up.  You take it.  You take it.  And then you've got  to take the bad  with the good, which  is the old bags  that come in  that need to be  But you still go  home every day  knowing you saw  one new young vag  a day.  That adds up.  Think how much  new spanking material  you would have  on a daily basis  as a gyno.  When she walks in,  you're seeing her  laid out,  you click that  in your little  brain Kodak,  and you could use  that until the  next one comes in.  So, yeah,  I guess that's a  pretty good gig, 
[02:56:00]  even through the  bad ones.  We have an  ass doctor nurse.  I'd like to ask  her if our doctor  she works for  is a gay man,  as per  Opi's theory.  Lynn on Long  Island, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I spoke to you  guys last week,  remember?  I'm on my way  to the ass doctor  to go put some  cameras up,  some buttons.  All right.  You're Lynn,  the ass doctor nurse.  Yes, I am.  Now, Lynn,  is your doctor,  would you consider  him a gay man?  Well, I'll tell you,  I work for a group. 
[02:56:30]  One of them is a  closet fag,  my friend.  Wow.  Ass doctor,  closet gay.  Yeah.  Interesting.  But he's very  metrosexual.  And he's probably  a professional,  but I don't see it  any other way.  I just don't.  There's too much  man-ass.  What's that?  He's married with  children or something?  He is?  Hello?  Oh, she gone?  Yeah.  We lost her cell  signal.  Let me go to  fucksicle.  Jesus.  Buddy, what's up? 
[02:57:00]  What's up?  Hey, man.  What's happening?  We're talking to you.  Let's go.  What do you want to  know, man?  I got tons of  stories about  dirty vag.  Well, you called  the show.  What do you got to  add?  Something about  dirty boxes.  You know, you guys  are talking about  vag, so my dad  comes home and  he'll talk about  dirty pussy all  day long and  how some girls  you can throw a  fucking wrench  through a garage  door.  And of course  he tells this in  front of your mom,  right?  Of course.  Yeah, he wants  to calm her down.  It's all about  calming her down. 
[02:57:30]  Of course he's  going to come home  and talk about  all the horrible  snatch he saw  all day.  Has he ever  talked about the  young 16, 15  year old coming  in for her first  exam?  Yes, he has.  In front of your  mom?  Yes, he has.  She's a nurse.  All right.  Well, that's a  little different, I  guess.  Not different at all.  But he talks about  it like, yeah,  there was some  skank coming in  today?  No, it's, hey  Bill, best  potatoes, you  should have seen  this box I saw  today.  Does he say  box?  Yeah, box  everything.  That's great. 
[02:58:00]  You're just a  box walking into  his office.  That's classic.  Sweaty, boxy  vag with junk  hanging out of  it.  He has to go  down to the  clinics every  month and deal  with the welfare  bitches and their  fucking nasty-ass  gangrenous vaginas  hanging out.  And then he  gets the hot  16-year-old girl  who comes in  out of hair  anywhere and  he talks about  the dinner table  and then back to  the dirty boxes  again.  Yeah, that's  great.  It must be fun  to eat tacos at  dinner at your  house.  Oh, the bearded  clam is plentiful.  Does he just 
[02:58:30]  open up, does he  put a speculum in  the clam to  shuck it?  Your perverted  father.  All right, thank  you.  Box.  That's funny.  You should have  seen this box.  Could you pass  the gravy?  You should have  seen this box  that came into  today.  Box.  The Opie and  Anthony Show.  Ah, you're 
[02:59:00]  checking out the  Opie and Anthony  program.  Feeling about  75% better, but  I couldn't stay  home anymore.  Yeah.  So really fast,  so just  to continue, I  was at the  doctor's office,  got the  physical, he  gave me some  Allegra D for  the, you know,  for the, you  know, for the  hack.  The hack, not  even the hack,  for the  congestion.  And I'm just 
[02:59:30]  about ready to  leave, and he  goes, one more  thing, and he  went and got the  glove again.  One more thing,  man.  And then I'm  like, you did  this already.  He goes, well, I  should get a  stool sample.  Yeah, well, you  take a dump to  get that.  That's what I  thought.  Pulling one out,  pulling out a  nugget.  So to make a  long story short, I  have to bend over  again and sing  Moon River.  Yeah.  Tells me to take  the deep breath  again.  He goes in, what  is he poking one  that's in there to  get the stool?  Oh, God. 
[03:00:00]  The stool sample?  Did he pull  something out?  I don't know what  he did.  I'm not looking.  Did you feel  him like scraping  in there to get  something?  He doesn't have a  mirror on the  ceiling or anything.  I don't know what's  going on.  But also, I think  that's what he said,  that he needed to  get a stool sample.  Because that's what  you do when you  get your physicals,  right?  Yeah, but usually  people get that out  of a bowl.  That's what I  thought.  They take a dump  and they give you  like a popsicle  stand.  I remember that,  yeah.  A plastic thing. 
[03:00:30]  You've got to  scoop a little.  Maybe this is  the new way  they get them.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This guy's a little  too eager to snap  that glove on his  hand every time  you walk in there.  So, yeah.  I mean, he went  for a poke to poke  one that's still in  me.  I don't know.  Doc, my eye is a  little red.  Okay, pull your  pants down.  No, not that one.  Doc, my ear.  I think I have an  ear infection.  Pull your pants  down, Opie.  Snap them gloves  on again.  But it's my ear. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, I know.  I've got to stick  my finger up your  ass, though.  I didn't even want  to know, man.  I was just like,  what are you doing  now?  We did this already.  Yeah.  But he said  something about a  stool sample.  Then he walks out  of the office  all awkwardly with  his one hand up  in the air.  Did he write it  in your chart as  our second date?  Or was it?  That's pretty, I  don't know, twice  like that to get a  stool sample.  Oh, he walked out  with his finger up  in the air?  Well, because I  guess he was going  for a microscope or  something.  He was going to  smear it on you. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know.  But then what was  funny, and this  isn't one of those  Ben funny stories  because it was  kind of funny.  So I'm now getting  ready to pull my  pants up, but of  course we don't  make eye contact  after this because  now it's like a  regular thing.  Hey, how you  doing?  Hey, how many  fingers are you  going to stick up  this time?  Hey.  What if you bump  into him at the  grocery store?  Will he stick his  finger up your ass?  Hey, how you  doing?  Oh, just want to  say hi.  Hey, pull your  pants down.  So then he's  walking out of  the examining  room.  I'm, you know,  getting myself 
[03:02:00]  back together.  Oh, my hair is  all askew.  Brushing your  hair and putting  on your makeup  and taking the  20 off the  dresser.  Just trying to  get myself back  together.  Yeah, presentable.  And there's no  eye contact, and  he's trying to  walk out of the  examining room.  He has that big  white doctor's  coat on, right?  Of course he  does.  And he's got his  one hand up in  the air, the right  hand, so he's  reaching for the  door with the  lab.  And he's just  got a stool  sample on the  tip of his  fan.  I didn't look,  dude, but his  hand was up in  the air.  I knew that  much. 
[03:02:30]  I wasn't  looking closely,  I should say.  And then all  of a sudden,  like, the  doorknob gets  caught on his  lab coat, and  he's all like,  he's all like a  mess.  Like, he's,  he's like,  trying to reach  back.  He can't use  that hand.  Right, he can't  use the hand  that's up in  the air, and  he's awkwardly  like, using the  other hand to  try to unhook  himself from the  doorknob.  Dude, I had to  help the  doctor.  I'm like,  let me get  that.  I'm like,  oh, God.  So I had to  undo his  pocket from the  doorknob so he 
[03:03:00]  could get out of  there.  And he  awkwardly slams  the door, and  I'm like,  thank God that  was over with.  And then he  comes back,  like, nothing  happened, like,  yeah, everything's  good there.  Yeah, he must  have been looking  for blood in it  or something.  I don't know,  man.  He probably  smeared it on  a slide, put it  in the microscope,  but Jesus.  What if you  didn't, oh,  yeah, Eric just  licked his finger  and went, hmm.  Like, he goes  into another room  and goes, no,  it tastes fine  to me.  It's not so  bad. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, gee,  that's awful.  If I was a  doctor, I would  be the doctor  with a sense  of humor,  because it's  an awkward  thing, whether  he's, like,  now violating  me or not,  I don't know.  You don't know.  You don't.  It could be  his thing.  You don't know.  But I'd be  the doctor with  a little, like,  chocolate pudding  on the side.  Oh, God.  When the  patient's not  looking, you  know, dip  another finger  in the chocolate  pudding.  Oh, geez.  Yeah, turn  around and just  go, nope,  all is good.  All right. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  As he watches  his license fly  off the wall,  out the window.  Yeah.  He sends  the humor.  No, the club  did not have a  marshmallow on it,  you asses.  This could be  the problem.  Oh, my God.  This is hilarious.  Let's go to  Artie in Yonkers.  Artie.  Hey, you're  a doctor short  fat guy with  big stubby fingers.  Why?  Did you have a  doctor with, like,  fat fingers?  Oh, man.  He had big old  man fingers.  Oh, Jesus.  I never shit so  much after I left 
[03:04:30]  that off.  You know, you  really want a  doctor with the  slenderest, slimmest,  feminine fingers  ever, I guess.  You don't want a  doctor with meat  hands.  Oh, that's funny.  Well, with a bunch  of hangnails.  You know, one of  those doctors that  has a pinky ring  that can fit  around your  dick, it's  so fucking  big.  That's horrible.  That's funny, bro.  Oh, man.  Then I had to  shit on a stick  and send it  into the mail  for a week.  Yeah, I don't  know what he  was doing this  time.  I don't even  want to know, 
[03:05:00]  man.  You know, that's  why I don't go  to the doctor  often, and I'm  done with my  physical.  I won't be  back in that  office for two  years.  Nice.  Minimum.  Two years for  your ass to  close back up.  And quite  frankly, I think  I'm going to  go find another  doctor.  Something's going  on there.  Carl, what's  up?  Hey, what's  going on?  Hey.  My doctor, every  time somebody  went to him,  they said they  had to pull  their pants  down.  So in  anticipation of  this reputation,  I was going to  see him for the  first time.  And I get in  the office, and I  start pulling my  pants down, and I 
[03:05:30]  bend over the  examining table, and  he goes, what the  fuck are you  doing?  Pull your pants  down.  The reputation  was false.  I was just  standing with my  pants down.  Dude, why would  you ever pull  your pants down  without the doctor  asking to?  Oh, you pull  them down like  you're wanting  it, you slut.  I heard you  have fat fingers.  Yeah, Doc.  I looked you  up.  I'm ready, Doc.  Could you use  two?  I'm ready. 
[03:06:00]  Jesus.  What are you  doing?  Oh, that is  awful.  The Opie and  Anthony Show,  XM20.  Here's Opie and  Anthony when  they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The Worst of Opie  and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  You want to do  this Groton Man  story real fast?  That's what we're  getting into.  Oh, everyone can  understand this.  Anyone who's been  married.  And this guy was  married for 29  years.  29 years. 
[03:06:30]  The guy was 51  years, is 51  years old.  Married 29 years.  Do a little math,  Opie.  29 years.  How old was he  when he got  married?  How old is he  now?  51.  Married 29  years.  He got married  too young.  So, now, you're  a 22-year-old guy,  right?  You should not be  getting married at  22 years old.  What?  23?  23.  I'm sorry.  Look at us with  our math skills.  Wait, how old is 
[03:07:00]  he?  Well, it's  subtraction.  That is a tough  one.  Wait, how old is  he?  51.  And he got  married at  22.  That's 29 years.  Why are you  saying 23 years?  Yeah, why are you  saying 23?  Jesus.  I swear to God.  He jumps in with  a correction and  it's wrong.  My English stinks  and your math stinks.  No, no, no.  I forgot to put it  on the other side.  Oh, right.  I practiced the  puts all weekend  long.  I'm sorry.  All right.  So, you know,  you're 22 years,  21 years old.  How old?  22 years old. 
[03:07:30]  And now, from  22 to 51, you  have this woman  that is just  telling you what  to do all the  time.  Ragging you.  And he finally  lost his mind.  A Groton man,  Groton, Connecticut,  charged with murder  in the death of his  wife, told police  that he ran her  over in their  driveway because  she berated and  nagged him.  Berated and  nagged him.  But that happens  to a lot of  couples. 
[03:08:00]  It does.  It certainly  does.  And this guy  couldn't take it  anymore.  His description  is classic of  what happened.  Blakeslee, 51,  said that on  September 10th,  his wife,  Christine,  nagged him  about a motor  vehicle ticket he'd  received several  weeks earlier.  Oh, okay.  I'm starting to feel  this story.  He said his  wife of 29  years would not  drop the matter. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, have you  been in this,  people?  How many times  have I told you  to slow down?  They're going to  take it, but you  won't slow down.  Yeah.  What happens?  When does it  turn into this,  by the way?  I don't know.  You always, like,  I don't know, you  start dating someone,  it's all about sex,  and you can't do  no wrong, she can't  do no wrong, but  slowly but surely,  all, like,  relationships creep  into this type of  a situation.  Opie, this is  after 29 years.  That's what I  mean, but it  slowly creeps, you  don't really notice  it happening, you  know? 
[03:09:00]  I was in a  relationship for a  while.  I'm not going to  mention any names,  who, what, where,  no names or  anything, but I  got to tell you,  being ragged on  and bitched at  is not a fun  thing.  Like not doing  your vacuuming  before I pick you  up?  Right.  All that kind of  fun stuff.  Oh, wow.  No, no, no.  Can I tell one  story?  What?  I used to, Ed  and I used to  commute because we  lived in the  same town where  we first moved  back to New  York.  Beautiful  Huntington, New  York.  Yeah, and I  picked up Anthony, 
[03:09:30]  you know, and we  take turns like  commuting in and  taking turns driving  and stuff.  I'll drive today.  And I would pick  up Anthony around,  I don't know, let's  say about 10.  It was pretty  accurate, right?  After rush hour,  we decided to come  in for our afternoon  show, get some  things done, maybe  meetings, whatever.  And I'm thinking  Anthony is not a  morning person, so  if I'm picking him  up at 10, he had to  have gotten up maybe  9, 9, 15.  Yep.  Seriously.  Absolutely.  And I would pick up  Anthony, and this was  more than once, like  Anthony would be at  the front door, and  his ex would be  yelling and screaming 
[03:10:00]  at him.  Yeah.  Yelling and screaming  at him, and I would  get pissed off, and he  would get in the car,  and I'm like, what  could you have  possibly done wrong?  I know you've only  been up for 45 minutes,  maybe an hour.  You know how much  stuff you could do  wrong in 45 minutes?  Are you kidding?  Do you know the  earth-shattering messes  you can concoct in 45  minutes?  I remember one time  it was because you  didn't vacuum.  I used to smile when I  walked out to get into  that car to come to  work.  Oh, would I smile. 
[03:10:30]  I was done for the  day.  And then...  Opie and his fun  mobile showing up at  your house, like,  whew!  Yeah, whew, here we  go.  And then after the  show, I would hang  out and play video  games until all hours  of the night.  Oh!  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You know what?  Yeah, no, meeting.  I gotta take a  Yeah, another meeting.  Oh, this one's going  on and on.  I don't know, you  know, we gotta meet  with people again.  You know, we got in  trouble, but I'll be  home.  I'll be...  I'll be home in,  like, November. 
[03:11:00]  Is that okay?  Why did I pick the  month it is?  What an idiot.  What a fucking  idiot.  And none of us  noticed.  Well, this bit, the  day is September 19th.  September 19th.  Yeah.  But I remember one  time, you came into  the car, I'm like,  what'd you do wrong?  Well, I was supposed  to vacuum before I  left for work.  I think I was  supposed to take out  the garbage.  I think that was it.  I think that was my  job.  All right.  Something like that.  But I won't mention  any names of this 
[03:11:30]  relationship, but it  was just a constant  ragging.  And there were times  where we would go  out, and this girl  would get a little  intoxicated.  Hopi.  A little drunk.  Sorry, I had  something in my  mouth.  Yeah, yeah.  And I would say,  before we even went  out, I would say,  look.  I'm going to check  my messages.  I think someone  might have called  while we were on  break.  Please, I'm begging  you, even after  you're drunk, try to  keep this in your 
[03:12:00]  head.  Whatever you're going  to start arguing  about isn't important  and does not need to  be pursued.  Does not even need.  So we're going out  to have fun.  It's going to be  fun.  Let's go out.  I'll tip a few  back, but keep it  light and airy and  fun.  Sure.  There's nothing to  argue about.  There's nothing to  argue about right  now, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  So nothing important  is going to happen  while we're out  drinking.  So let's remember  that and keep it.  Let's fast forward  four hours. 
[03:12:30]  I'll say four hours.  You motherfucker.  No, no, because  you don't clean.  I do every fucking  thing.  All right.  And I'm like,  I'm like, remember  the conversation?  Do you remember?  You fuck yourself.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm going to be  sitting over here  for a while.  This is unbelievable.  And, you know, 
[03:13:00]  occasionally you do  get it in your mind.  If she was in front  of my car, would I  put it in drive, as  this gentleman in  this article did, and  maybe hit the gas?  We'll get back to  that story.  Oh, that's where we  were the whole time.  Oh, okay.  Well, can I ask a  question?  Yes.  If you're dating  someone and you feel  that they're drinking  too much, wouldn't you  say, like, maybe you  shouldn't drink before  we go out?  No.  No, no.  Can I say something  else?  If she's not drinking,  and I'm not  drinking, and I  had a drink.  Can I say something  else?  Yeah.  She would call while 
[03:13:30]  we were on the air  because it was happy  hour time, because we  did three to seven.  And I remember phone  calls where you would  beg her not to get  too drunk before you  got there.  No shots.  No shots till I get  there.  And it's this big  radio star, and he's  begging this certain  individual not to get  too hammered before he  got there.  I had to.  Christine Blakeslee,  54, was bitching  about the parking  ticket he'd received  several weeks earlier. 
[03:14:00]  He said his wife of  29 years would not  drop the matter, so he  decided to get in his  truck and leave.  That's a pretty  rational thing for a  guy to do, leave the  situation.  Christine Blakeslee,  the wife, followed  him, climbed up on the  running board.  He drove the truck in  reverse, causing his  wife to fall.  Now, under normal  circumstances, that  would be a waker-upper  right there.  You'd go, holy  jeez, she just fell  off the running board.  Things got out of  hand.  Let me see if she's  okay. 
[03:14:30]  You know, she was  ragging me and stuff.  Things got out of  hand.  Now, this should  pretty much take care  of the problem.  He's quoted as  saying, I stopped at  the truck and looked  out in front of me.  Picture this scene.  Blakeslee said in his  statement, my wife was  there in the  headlights.  She was kneeling  with her hands  in front of her.  Small pause.  I stepped on the  gas.  How great is that? 
[03:15:00]  I stepped on the  gas.  She never looked  up.  I just wanted to  make her stop.  I didn't think about  the consequences.  he just wanted to  make it stop.  That voice in his  head.  Just make it stop.  That voice. 
[03:15:30]  Parking ticket.  Back, back.  Stop.  Back.  I told you.  I told you so.  Just holding on to  the running board.  Probably turned and  looked at her face,  pressed against the  window.  What are you doing?  I told you.  Where are you going?  Get back here.  I stepped on the gas.  She never looked up.  I just wanted to  make her stop.  I didn't think about  the consequences.  I heard a thud.  Then I thought I heard  her scream.  I didn't stop right  away.  I stopped when it  came to me that I 
[03:16:00]  hit her.  I kept thinking,  oh my God,  I just killed my  wife.  He said he returned  to the house.  And what did he do  afterwards, Opie?  Did he call 911?  Did he check on her?  Did he freak out?  He went to sleep.  He finally got  sleep.  It was finally  quiet.  First night of  peaceful sleep.  And I'll tell you  another.  She's like just dead  in the driveway.  She's dead in the  driveway. 
[03:16:30]  He's like,  he's snoozing away.  Let me tell you  another treat that  some guys have to  go through.  The I gotta go to  sleep, but there's a  fight going on.  You're in bed.  You have to get up  for work.  You're in bed.  Is this a real story  or this is something  that you've heard?  Let's just say I  might be familiar  with this certain  situation.  I'm going to go sit  back over here for  a while.  There's been a  drunken argument.  You're trying to  rationalize, but it's  like rationalizing  with a pumpkin or a 
[03:17:00]  porcupine or a  cactus.  You know, try to  rationalize with it.  It's not going to  listen.  So you finally decide  it's time for bed.  It's time for bed.  You gotta sleep.  My God, you gotta  sleep.  It's six in the  morning and you're  going to bed.  Climb into bed.  You're all aggravated,  but maybe you can just  relax long enough and  go to sleep.  From downstairs.  Fucking idiot.  Son of a bitch.  Why the... 
[03:17:30]  Son of a fucking  prick.  God damn son of a  bitch.  I'll never listen to a  fucking word.  I...  Dang it, son...  Motherfucker.  Now you're trying to  sleep.  Oh, yes.  Your gym's uncomfortable.  Now you're trying to  sleep.  And this is all going on  and you're trying.  I hate these stories.  And you think in your  head, do I just lay here  and hopefully fall asleep  or it's a fine line.  Do I wake up and  continue this argument  that now we'll put it  into hyperdrive? 
[03:18:00]  Can I throw something  else into this mix?  Yes, yes.  When that's going on  and you're upstairs,  part of you's got to  be thinking, she might  stab me.  Yeah, there were  some times you would  actually think something  might happen.  Yeah, yeah.  All kinds of thoughts  go through your head.  But you know the best  thing.  Is to stay in bed  and try to go to sleep.  Because you've tried  them all before.  You've tried all the  you get up and  continue trying to  rationalize.  It just goes on and  on.  It doesn't end. 
[03:18:30]  And then when you  finally do sleep and  she sleeps and  everyone wakes up,  it never happened.  Hey, how you doing?  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  You're living with  what's her name from  misery.  And then, oh.  Kathy Bates.  Yeah, Kathy Bates.  Hey!  A young version of  Kathy Bates.  Morning.  Morning.  Oh, you.  And you're like,  where's Opie?  Beat the horn, Opie. 
[03:19:00]  Please.  Hong, Hong.  Oh, I gotta go.  Oh, it's time for work.  You know I was your  savior, right?  Why are you leaving  at 8 a.m.?  You haven't acknowledged  lately that I was your  savior.  What?  You just haven't  acknowledged it lately.  I want to hear it today.  I'd have probably  left sooner if it  wasn't for you and  Sandy.  How was your savior?  I'm not gonna say  that.  You were my savior as  far as work goes.  Get me this kick-ass  job in radio.  But I brought fun  back into your life. 
[03:19:30]  I'm really assessing  this.  Hold on.  You gave me the cool  job in radio.  No, just the  opportunity and you  having nothing to do  with any relationships  I've been in.  I don't think that  really fits, Opie.  I don't know because  I don't think you  would ever get  divorced.  Are you insane?  Well, you talked  about how you  couldn't get divorced  for a while there.  Why?  Wait, how many...  Didn't you want to  get divorced way  before you did? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  That's what I'm  saying.  And I didn't because  I had a kick-ass job  in radio.  I don't get it.  Well, it was just  kind of a good  distraction.  Well, that's what I  mean.  I was your savior.  Or my curse.  If you think of it  that way, I would  have been out of it.  You think?  Perhaps earlier.  It was a good  distraction.  I was having a good  time away from the  house.  Well, that's what I  mean by the savior  part.  I gave you a nice  distraction.  Because it's blood on  your hands and on  your feet, stigmata?  My savior?  Well, no, this is 
[03:20:30]  what the point I'm  getting at is that I  think I know you well  enough to know that  you realized early on  that you weren't in  the greatest  relationship, right?  But you also had a  shitty job.  So you had a shitty  job, then you had  this going on at  home, but then you  got into radio, so at  least it gave you fun,  fun, fun.  And a distraction.  I think I'd have  walked away from the  entire situation  earlier.  The job, the woman,  everything, if I was  still in that crappy  job.  I think it would have 
[03:21:00]  really, who knows.  So what happened to the  Blakesleys?  By the way, can I say  that Robert Blake's  wife's last name was  Blakely?  How coincidental is  that?  None whatsoever.  Not funny or  interesting either.  As I said it, that's  good job, flow stopper.  An autopsy report  ruled Christine  Blakesley's death, ruled  her death a homicide,  saying she died of  blunt, forced chest  trauma.  Oh, hit her right in  the chest of the bumper.  Not only did he hit  her, he hit her.  He's like, if I'm  going to do this, I'm  going to make it look 
[03:21:30]  good.  He went to the house,  went to sleep, told  police he woke up,  checked the driveway,  saw his wife was still  there, and called  911.  I didn't want to face  what happened, he  said.  I was hoping it was  all a bad dream.  Yeah, a 29-year bad  dream.  She jumped on the  running board.  She's bitching about  a ticket.  You fucking bitch.  And he realized  he'd killed his  wife, he tried to  commit suicide by  drinking and taking  Tylenol.  What's that going to 
[03:22:00]  do?  In his second version,  he told police he  woke up early in the  morning, heard a car  breaking, then a  thud, looked out a  window and saw a  light-colored car  driving away.  Blakesley told police  he returned to bed  and noticed that his  wife was gone, said  he found her dead in  the driveway.  How are you going to  say that when there's  a dent in your car  because you hit your  wife?  Her hair is in your  bumper.  What a foolish thing.  At least you saw a  light-colored car with  a black guy in it  driving away. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, it wasn't in  Boston.  Okay.  It was in Connecticut.  I am sorry.  I didn't want to kill  her.  I just wanted her to  stop.  That's what it says.  Ladies, do some  thinking.  Do thinking.  Are you an egg?  Are you ragging your  husband?  Are you constantly  just pecking away at  his head?  But in the beginning  it's just not like that.  But something happens  slowly but surely and  then you wake up one day  and realize, oh my God, 
[03:23:00]  I'm in a nightmare.  Opie, sometimes you can  find the right person you  get along with, you can  chat with, and it's  wonderful.  But when you're in a  situation, you're in a  relationship like that,  you've got to get out.  You've got to run.  Because it's going to end  up, she will either  kill you through the  nagging or you will see  her in the headlights,  on her knees, hands in  front of her.  And you know what  choice you'll make?  The little skinny  pedal on the right.  We haven't played this  in a couple days. 
[03:23:30]  We're not going to  break, though.  I just want to play  this really fast.  Oh, I love this.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  You wouldn't get away  with it here.  But you should.  You shouldn't get away  with it at home.  She spilled my coffee.  The little laugh is the  greatest.  The little chuckle,  because he knows what's  coming.  He's laughing because he's  the only one that knows 
[03:24:00]  what's coming.  I'm sorry, sir.  That coffee-spilling bitch  has no clue she's getting  that in the face.  Just desserts.  Janine, what's going  on?  Hello?  Hey, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I just want to say that  you guys are making me  want to leave my husband  out of an act of mercy.  Why?  Do you rag him?  I hate me right now.  Are you a rag?  A nag?  I don't want to be.  I don't want to be.  I don't think I have a  choice, though.  It's in our nature.  Why?  Why don't you have a choice? 
[03:24:30]  Because he's a guy,  and he does stupid guy  things, and I just  can't let go.  Sometimes those stupid  guy things we do at the  beginning of the  relationship were called  cute.  Yeah, they were called  cute, and I used to  want to keep him in my  closet and take him out  and look at him because  he was so funny, and now  I just want to lock him  in there, and I'm sure he  wants to kill me half the  time.  And the things you guys  rag about, they used to  not be that big an issue,  and then slowly they become  this big issue that needs  to be addressed on a  minutely basis. 
[03:25:00]  Your clothes are on the  floor.  I suck.  They totally suck, and  on Halloween, I was  jumping up and down  yelling because he  refused to put on his  mask.  I'm a dick.  See, those are things.  If you don't want to put  on a mask, you don't put  on a mask.  You know what?  I used to get ragged  at all the time at  weddings.  Come on, let's dance.  Let's get up and  dance.  And I'm like, I don't  want to dance.  I want to sit here.  I want to finish my 
[03:25:30]  drink, and I just want  to sit here and watch  everyone else dance  because they look like  drunken buffoons.  Get up and dance.  Why don't you have a  dance?  And then the arm pull  where you've got to  hold onto your seat.  Now it's assault.  I don't want to dance.  And it's just ragged.  Pick, pick, pick, pick.  Pick, pick, pick.  Pick, pick, pick.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting uncomfortable.  I'm sorry.  I hate these flashbacks.  I just hate this.  This is the only time.  Poor guy doesn't want  to put a mask on  and you're yelling  at him.  Yelling at him.  What kind of mask 
[03:26:00]  was it?  What kind of mask?  It was a stupid  burglar mask.  It was the only thing  I could get him to  wear because it was  cheap and easy.  But he's a musician  and I try to do  everything for him.  So then when it's  my time, I have to  insist that it goes  my way and I'm just  an asshole.  What kind of burglar  mask?  Like one around the  eyes or one around  the mouth?  It's ridiculous.  Like a hamburglar?  I think every marriage  should end after  seven years.  Think seven years?  Seven years.  That's it.  I think there should be  an option.  Like you go a few  years and you have  an option to re-up  your marriage license. 
[03:26:30]  You got to get it.  You know, it could  expire.  You laugh, but it's  not a bad idea.  If both parties are  in agreeance, you re-up  your marriage license  for another couple  of years.  Instead of like  signing that marriage  certificate and now  you're stuck for life  because all the women  get all the money  and stuff when you  do finally divorce.  You can't get a  lifetime fishing license.  Right.  And that's for a fish.  Right.  But you could get a  wife and it's a  lifetime license that  never expires.  Who stays in one  job for 40 years?  No one.  Exactly.  Why do you have to  stay with the same 
[03:27:00]  person for 40 years?  You do.  Because you said  marriage in this  day and age just  doesn't make sense  anymore.  No.  It just doesn't.  Thanks to you guys  I'm going to drive  away and I'm never  going to look back  and you'll hear it  on the replay and  honey I'm sorry I'm  doing this because I  love you.  Do you like sucking  God?  I'm going.  Leave him alone.  Yeah leave him  alone man.  Or be a friend.  Be a chick that's  interesting.  Do something like  cup of fart and  throw it in his face.  He'll love you for  that.  Do something silly.  I'll learn to gag 
[03:27:30]  more.  Nice.  Yeah that's nice.  We like when you  gag just a little bit.  You should have  said put the mask  on honey.  Huffle.  Yeah.  I told you the  girl that would put  the bucket by the  side of my.  Yes.  Yeah.  Alright.  Thank you Janine.  I'll learn to gag.  Thank you.  Oh you remember the  ice cream.  Good memory.  I like Anthony's  I like your  suggestion there man.  Yeah.  A little license  renewal thing.  Have a marriage  license with an  expiration.  It's not a bad  idea.  Let's say hi to  Keith in Cincinnati.  How about those  Bengals Keith huh?  That looked good  yesterday.  They kicked the 
[03:28:00]  Cowboys ass 26 to  3.  Well maybe if we  didn't have a 50  year old quarterback  that wouldn't  happen.  Well you guys got  rid of the coke guy.  I didn't.  Parcells did that.  Dope.  What was his name  again?  Quincy Carter.  Yeah Quincy.  Vinny with three  interceptions.  Vinny stinks.  Dude we knew  Vinny was awful  when he was with  the Jets.  That's how you  build an offense.  Take someone from  the Jets.  What's the matter?  Wasn't Daryl  Stingley available?  Wow.  Wow.  But he's in a  wheelchair Jimmy. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah I was  calling just to  really you're  talking about  nagging women.  I'm getting  ready to go  through a divorce  myself and I  was married to  the naggingest  bitch on the  face of the  earth.  Yeah but it  didn't start like  that right?  I'm sorry?  It didn't start  like that right?  I still didn't  pick that up.  Your line is  really distorting  on my end.  Your relationship  didn't start like  that with her  nagging.  Oh hell no.  Maybe this guy  needs to be  nagged too.  You just got to  tell him three  fucking times. 
[03:29:00]  He doesn't  listen.  I can relate to  the right pedal  versus the middle  pedal.  Trust me I can  relate to it but  I would never  take it that far.  So when did you  realize that the  nagging was  definitely a problem?  Because I bet  you at first  there's a little  nag that comes  your way but  you're like eh  whatever.  Maybe she  just had a  bad day where  I could take  it.  What?  I thought it  was hormone  fling from the  pregnancy.  She got  pregnant early  on.  I thought it  was just  that after  she stayed  a bitch so  it wasn't  that.  You should 
[03:29:30]  be able to  get out of  this stuff  without a  lawyer getting  involved.  Now she's  a mom with  her stupid  socks pulled  up over the  stretchy pants.  Yeah no  problem man.  Alright Keith  good luck to  you there.  Thank you.  Have a good  one.  I don't know  where this guy's  going but we'll  see.  Bill in  Boston what's  up?  What's up guys?  How about  those socks?  How about the  Pats?  You gotta  congratulate  them on the  Pats.  I already did  the Pats score.  I gotta do it 
[03:30:00]  again.  I gotta do it  again.  Pats beat the  Rams 40 to  22.  Who cares?  Go ahead.  I don't know  if you can  like how much  can you talk  about your  divorce?  Like was there  any agreement  in the settlement  or anything like  that?  I'm just talking  about general  relationships sir.  Yeah yeah.  I think Anthony  speaks freely.  That's it.  Well I wanted  to ask you like  out of all the  lawyers in New  York why would  she hire Dominic  Barbara who's  associated with  Howard?  Yeah and then  the company  doesn't understand  why we hate 
[03:30:30]  Howard and we  should get along  with him.  Yeah okay.  I would guess  you know I don't  know why but I  would guess because  it's a you know  one of those  great little  tactics it just  it puts the fear  of things being  in the public eye  on someone else's  radio show it  you know he's  known for being a  pretty good divorce  lawyer too.  Right.  All right.  There you go.  That's that.  There it is.  Huh?  There it is.  What?  There it is.  There it is.  Okay.  We got Tony 
[03:31:00]  Dan's outtakes.  Outtakes?  Outtakes.  You mean  applause breaks?  No these are  outtakes.  Outtakes from?  From doing promos  for a show.  How do we get  these?  We don't want to  tell anyone how  we got these.  We are entrenched.  We're well  connected in this  city.  That's great.  We got outtakes  of Tony Danza  trying to do  some promos.  Right Steve?  We're going to  take a break first  by this.  Don't say where  you got it from  because this guy  could be a gold  mine.  What is that hat  you're wearing?  What's on the  side of that one?  It's flames 
[03:31:30]  and a skull  on one side.  Exactly.  Flames and skull.  That's why you  were able to wear  the shirt with  nothing on it.  Exactly.  I had to  compensate.  Yeah.  I had to  compensate with  the hat.  I like it.  You think about  what you're going  to wear every  day.  Well to the  extent that  you fold up  your sleeves  perfectly.  Yeah.  Just like two  and a half times  on each side.  I get the most  disgusted look  from Norton  right now.  It's just the  hat.  Oh.  Okay.  No.  I can't say  where we got it  but.  I can't.  Yeah.  I can't even  listen to you  talk anymore 
[03:32:00]  because of Norton.  Why?  Yes.  Go ahead.  Can't say  where we got it?  What exactly  is the audio?  Oh the audio.  It's Outtakes.  Are you playing it?  Pardon me.  Martini Steve.  There's Martini Steve.  Oh it is.  So we got this  audio from what?  A very nice person.  All right.  You came in  for that?  I was told to  come into the studio.  I don't really  know what the  hell I was talking  about.  I can't hear you 
[03:32:30]  guys in the other  room by the way  so I'm yelled at  to get into the studio.  What are you working  on today for the show?  What I handed you  and then some more  audio of a pre-interview  from that show.  Is that good?  I don't know yet.  It's dumping into  Pro Tools right now.  All right.  Are you letting your  hair grow back  or are you going  to keep it short?  I'm going to let  it grow back.  It's cool short.  Thank you sir.  I like it.  Thank you.  Yeah I like it's  growing in and it's  growing in at the  same rate as his  sideburns.  Exactly.  Uniformity.  Pork chop sideburns  on the side.  You were that kid  in school man.  You grow that  crap in a day. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah I was at  12 I had sideburns.  He was 5 o'clock  shadow guy.  He's Lebanese.  We all had one of  those guys in school  growing up.  My buddy Joe Curry  was a foot.  Plank foot.  Yeah yeah yeah.  He was that guy.  He actually got  thrown out of the  school one day and  he was going to the  school.  They were convinced  he wasn't a student  and he was telling  them no I go here  and they just kept  ushering him out the  door because he had a  full beard.  I mean like ridiculous  full grizzly Adam's  beard.  No I go here.  He was no it was  his senior year so he 
[03:33:30]  was you know 17,  18.  The type of guy that  gets served when he's  like 16 right.  Oh yeah he was  buying beers for us.  You know he was the  great guy to have  around because he  could go in and buy  beers.  They wouldn't proof him.  Mark wants in.  Go ahead Mark.  Hey what's up guys.  I just signed my  divorce papers two  weeks ago.  Congratulations.  Bro you don't  understand I would  bust my ass.  Take clients out  after work.  I'd get home at  3 in the morning and  have to be back  my office at 630 so  enough time for a  half hour nap and a  shower and she would  bitch and bitch. 
[03:34:00]  Meanwhile all day she  was sitting at  Americana shopping  center spending the  money I fucking made  on a little prod of  shoes.  So you know what  they nag and they  nag and you know  what I can understand  why somebody wants to  run their wife over.  You know for that  little minute where  she's just glimmering  in the headlights for  that split second  where any rational  thinking human being  would say no and  you put it in park  and go what am I  thinking but there's  there's that one  little moment.  Well you want to  tell them put your  head by the hood see  if you hear that 
[03:34:30]  noise.  Could you could you  listen I hear a  clicking.  Right right what is  that band that said  it's over.  All right.  Thank you guys.  Show's great.  The marriage was  going well but I was  drinking consistently  on the road.  Oh Jesus.  Jim's smart though.  He knows he can't  hear it.  Oh very good.  Mr. Smarty Pants.  One more.  We got to go to  Phoenix.  Say hi to Mike.  Hey Mike what's up.  By the way as I'm  putting income in the  bank week after week 
[03:35:00]  I was told I was  told I couldn't get a  cell phone.  Remember that?  Yeah I do Anthony.  I want a cell phone.  Just like you.  You don't need a  cell phone.  Just like your pal  Opie.  I think I was a bad  influence on you.  You don't need a  cell phone.  All I was was a  cell phone.  I remember you guys  got an argument.  You don't need a  cell phone.  You want a cell  phone.  What if there's an  emergency?  Well you know you  can get a car phone  like a big unit that  goes in the car but  no cell phone.  Son of a bitch. 
[03:35:30]  And then you got to  weigh.  You got to weigh it.  Do I be a man and  get the cell phone and  say go fuck yourself  or do I not have to  deal with an argument  now because of this?  What was the problem  with the cell phone?  There has to be a  reason.  What?  There has to be some  rational reason?  Wait a minute.  Have you been  listening?  There has to be a  reason for some of  this stuff?  I thought there might  have been a reason that  was told to you.  A reason?  Yeah.  Like a legitimate  argument.  A legitimate other  side.  Other view.  Dude people thought. 
[03:36:00]  That would then be  focused back to me  that I would then.  What?  People thought we were  rock stars and you're  having these arguments  behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Over our cell phone.  Wow.  The only rocking I was  doing was in my own  feces as I was trying to  figure out how I would  get out of this.  Please.  There was nothing  going on.  And you did quite well  for yourself my friend.  I was able to come  you know something like  the sad clown.  I was able to come in on  a daily basis and make  people laugh though I  cried inside.  Oh they laughed and  they laughed and they 
[03:36:30]  laughed.  Though I cried inside.  Oh my god.  John the trucker.  We got to take a break  but John go ahead.  Is my mic on?  Should be.  I'm just going to make  a suggestion.  Can you hear me fella?  How you can keep the  second wife from nagging.  Holy shit.  Is this today's problem?  John can you hear  Norton?  Yeah.  John if I ask you a  question right now you  can hear me.  I can hear you.  Oh okay.  Oh then it was that  guy's problem.  No problemo.  Alright go ahead John.  I'm just going to tell you  how to keep the second  wife from nagging.  You shoot and kill the  first one. 
[03:37:00]  I like it.  Yeah a little warning.  He's not kidding.  Why would you even  have a second wife?  I could not imagine  getting married the  second time.  Just don't happen.  I met her when I was  in prison.  You met your second  wife while you were  in prison?  Yeah.  For killing your first  wife?  Right.  You really killed  your first wife?  I shot her with that  bitch right through  the fucking head.  Alright hold on.  We're not taking a  break anytime soon.  Now I...  Dude he's a trucker. 
[03:37:30]  You got to believe him.  Now what were these  circumstances?  And how did you get  out of jail?  I was 15 to life.  I got out in 15 years.  I thought this guy  was just a little  cute little joke.  How do you keep  your second wife  from nagging you?  You killed the  first one.  You killed the  first one.  Ha ha ha.  Little joke.  Thank you and  then you're listening  to the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Dude you got to  tell us what happened.  Give me the story.  What happened leading  up to and after  killing your wife?  Yeah let's back up  here.  What led up to it? 
[03:38:00]  What did she do  to deserve this?  Well we were both  doing acid.  We was all fucked up.  Oh my god we're  talking to Charlie  Manson.  Kept me nagging me.  Kept me nagging me.  I come on board  one day I was all  fucked up on acid.  She started in.  I just blowed  her fucking head off.  She was ragging.  Do you remember  hey John do you  remember what she  was nagging you  about?  Oh she was nagging  about my killing  in late and shit.  Now I got off work  at four in the  afternoon.  I want to get  home till like 
[03:38:30]  eleven twelve  o'clock at night.  What were you  doing?  You never spend  no time with me.  You never do  this.  You never do  that.  I was like well  bitch you never  spend time with me.  How old a guy  are you John?  Do what?  How old are you?  Right now I'm  forty nine.  Forty nine.  Okay so you  decided to kill her.  So what did you  do?  You grabbed your  shotgun.  Come on.  No I always  carried the pistol.  I lived back in  Kansas back there.  So you always  had a pistol on  you and you 
[03:39:00]  just leveled it  at her and  shot her in the  head?  Shot her right  between the  fucking eyes.  Was she surprised?  A little bit.  Did she look?  I don't know if  she was so  surprised or she  just amazed I'd  do it.  What size gun  was it sir?  Twenty two.  Oh wow that  gives them a little  time to think about  it.  Oh Jesus.  Was she alive  after you shot her?  Twenty two does  better really than  there's a head  wound.  You think so?  Riches around.  Kind of bounces  around in the 
[03:39:30]  brain pan a little  bit.  So then.  Yeah it kind of  scrambles it rather  than voids a hole  completely through it.  So then she.  Did she live  through the initial  blast?  No.  She was dead.  She dropped  dead right there  on the spot.  I sat down and  spoke to joint and  called the cops.  Told them I  killed her.  They come out  and pick my  ass up.  Send somebody.  I think I killed  Doyle.  Eating potatoes.  That's what that  buddy of mine said.  He goes,  that sounds like  something out of  that fucking  sling blade. 
[03:40:00]  Poor little  feller.  Alright so then  they arrested you  and you were  convicted.  I killed Doyle.  And you only got  fifteen to life?  Fifteen to life  out of it.  And how many  years did you serve?  I'm sorry,  you both talked  at the same time.  Sorry,  how much time  did you serve?  Fifteen years.  Fifteen years.  Sir,  I have to ask you  the question now.  You're out,  you're a trucker.  Was it worth it?  Yeah, 
[03:40:30]  because I didn't  pay no fucking  support.  It was worth it.  He spent fifteen  years in prison  for killing his  wife and he says  it was worth it.  How did you  break that news  to your second  wife?  She knew about  it.  I just told her  to read this  newspaper article,  told her the  dates and stuff.  She pulled it up  and looked at it.  Alright,  I gotta tell you  what's going on  in the studio.  Jim was not  buying this story  when we started, 
[03:41:00]  right?  Not at all.  I want to put  this guy on hold.  I want to get  his last name.  I want to see  if we can find  an article on this.  Oh,  yeah,  your name would  pop up in the  news,  right?  It should.  It was a long  time ago,  but it should.  Alright,  you know what?  Can you hold  on through the  break?  Yeah.  Alright,  hold on.  Alright,  we gotta see  if this is real.  John the trucker  killed his wife.  Wait,  we could ask him  one other thing.  Give me John  for a second.  And then he did  15 years to life. 
[03:41:30]  So,  John,  your second wife  started writing  you in prison?  Yeah,  she started writing  me when,  oh,  I put my name  in Easy Rider  magazine,  you know,  that mail call.  Right.  Oh my God,  this guy,  alright,  we'll get the  second part of  your story next.  So,  he had his name  in Easy Rider.  Easy Rider.  And she started  writing him in prison  and then he gets  out 15 years later  and they get  married.  Yeah.  Wow.  Alright,  obviously,  you'll stick around  because we've got  to get the  second part of  this story  in just a minute  here.  Ladies and gentlemen,

[03:42:30]  I, I, I can't believe it.  Are you insane?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, goddamn.  Alright.  Say what again?  Come on, say what?  What?  What the fuck?  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Ah.  Give it to me.  Fuck it.  Hey.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.

[03:43:30]  Next little glitch we've got to take care of.  Yeah.  Not as many glitches as we head into the second week of the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The truckers are helping us out and our fans are helping us out, turning on new people every single day.  Thank you for that.  We greatly appreciate it.  Yeah, this is what we've got to...  This is the next glitch.  Oh, the mic stands.  Somehow we've got to figure that out because it's driving people nuts. 
[03:44:00]  But, like, you know, I'm sitting now, but then when we get really excited and get into it, I want to get up here and move around.  You know, so...  Sounds like what you hear through the motel wall.  With the muffled.  Oh, God, that sucks.  It's not as muffled as if you use the glass that they give you in the room.  I'm sorry. 
[03:44:30]  I thought we were getting into that.  I was getting into that in a strange way, too.  What do you hear?  Hotel sex.  You hear it right through the wall.  Yeah.  Shut up.  The O.P. & Anthony Show.
