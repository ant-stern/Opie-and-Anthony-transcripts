<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the launch of a new segment, the "Tuesday Night Hummer Club," designed to spice up marital intimacy by encouraging wives to initiate sex with their husbands on Tuesdays.  The hosts fielded calls from listeners, including one from a man whose wife was likened to "Nurse Ratched," leading to a live on-air plea to his wife. She reluctantly agreed, albeit with stipulations.  The segment then devolved into a naming contest for the club, with "Clean Your Tubes Tuesday" emerging as a popular suggestion.  Listeners also submitted proposed oaths of membership, alongside accounts of their own participation and experiences with the Hummer Club.  This was interspersed with a bet on the longevity of Bob Hope and Joe DiMaggio, and a Brady Bunch trivia contest, which showcased Anthony's impressive knowledge.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on arranging a “Hummer” for listener John from his wife, Sue, via a live phone call.  The hosts, using highly sexually suggestive language, manipulated Sue into agreeing, presenting it as a reward for John’s loyalty to the show and branding their actions as "Pimp Radio."  The hosts’ banter was heavily focused on the act itself, playfully mocking John's apparent desperation. The segment concluded with the successful arrangement and suggestive implications that the act was taking place, prompting further playful teasing before being abruptly cut short due to incoming calls.

The show's conclusion featured comedian Andrew Dice Clay delivering a humorous, sexually explicit oath for female members of the "Tuesday Night Hummer Club," followed by another live call to a wife, attempting to persuade her to participate on her husband's behalf.  Numerous additional listener calls and emails detailed their involvement with and reactions to the Hummer Club initiative.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, Van Halen, Everybody Wants Some.  That song is very appropriate to what we're talking about today on the program.  It's Opie and Anthony, and the revolution continues here.  Yeah, today is sort of maybe a solution that we were trying to think up for yesterday's show.  Yesterday's show ended on a note where we were kind of seeing a lot of people were miserable.  And everyone was, yeah, they were sad, and they went home kind of feeling kind of empty.  And they resigned to the fact that this is their life, they're married now, their dating life might have been great, they're married, 
[00:00:30]  and something happened along the way where they're just not as happy anymore, not as sexually active, and that's causing some problems in the marriage.  Well, we tried to think of a quick fix, and I think this is a good one.  Opie came up with an idea, a brainstorm last night.  Brainstormed a little bit, and we came up with the concept, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  If you come up with a better name for this, we'll definitely accept it, because we like to get the people involved with our show.  2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W is the fax line. 
[00:01:00]  But basically, we're encouraging the ladies sometime today on Tuesday to give their man or their lady friend, I don't care who you go out with,  just give them a wah-wah to their wah-wah-wah-wah.  The Hummer Club.  The Hummer Club.  Easy as that.  Simple as that.  And the ladies we've talked to thus far on our show, they're all for it, Anthony.  Very receptive.  Sometimes you just need an icebreaker.  I don't know what happens.  When you're dating, you go at it like rabbits. 
[00:01:30]  I remember there were times I came home for lunch from work.  Boom!  There you go.  You're going at it.  Yeah.  And then something happens along the way, and things slow down.  You don't know why.  Maybe distractions, kids, the job, the pressure.  I don't know what it is.  But this is an icebreaker now, where on Tuesday nights, the guy can go home and go like, you know, I just might get something tonight.  Yeah.  I might get that little wah-wah-wah-wah.  And you're at dinner, and you both listen to our show.  You're going to kind of smile and go, oh, did you hear what those wackos were talking about today? 
[00:02:00]  And it's all fun and games.  And the next thing you know, it's probably going to happen.  A little opportunity.  You're sitting home.  Maybe you're sipping a little wine.  Yeah.  A little dinner, a little wine.  You're feeling a little fun.  And then all of a sudden, you're like, did you hear Opie and Anthony today?  Oh, it's the Tuesday thing.  Boy, that's crazy, huh?  Yeah.  Before you know it.  Uh-uh-uh.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the opportunity to break the ice a little.  So, ladies, take his wah-wah and wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah. 
[00:02:30]  We have a guy on the line who needs a little help.  All right.  He needs our help.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  All right.  Listen, I was hoping perhaps you could help me join your club.  How can we help you?  I'm a bit at a disadvantage.  Well, first of all, let me ask you this.  Does it have to be with your wife?  We don't really care how it happens.  Okay.  Because that's up to you.  Whatever you're into.  We're hoping it would be if you're married with your wife.  That's the proper thing.  Because, I mean, we're just trying to help people out that are a little miserable in their relationship.  Well, speak about misery. 
[00:03:00]  I've been sick for about four or five days now.  My head's about to explode.  Well, basically, my wife has turned into Nurse Ratched.  And Nurse Ratched informed me yesterday morning that I'm coughing too loudly now.  So, when she gets home from work tonight, I don't know what the chances are.  So, I need you to reach out for me.  Okay.  Can you do that?  Yeah.  What do you want us to do?  Our name's Kelly.  You want to give her a call?  Yeah.  Let's give Kelly a call.  All right.  Hold on.  We're going to call her while you're on the air here.  Okay.  Cool.  Dude, we'll do all the talking.  Don't say a word. 
[00:03:30]  Hello?  Kelly.  Yeah.  Hi, it's Opie and Anthony from NEW Radio.  Hello.  Hi.  You listen to us?  Yes, I do.  Oh, cool.  We got you live in the air, if that's okay.  Uh, do you?  Yeah.  Did you hear what we started today?  No, I only had you on for part of the day.  Well, we started the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah, I heard all about that.  Oh, you did?  Already?  A little about it yesterday.  I heard what you were doing, bashing married people and everything else.  No, we really weren't bashing married people.  We were just exposing the misery that a lot of married couples are in. 
[00:04:00]  And it just happens that you fall into it over the years.  Now, your husband's home sick.  Yes.  And he wants...  He called you.  Yes, I...  Okay.  He says you're starting to act like Nurse Ratched.  I've always been like Nurse Ratched.  I'm not starting.  You said he's coughing too loudly?  Yeah, he makes a lot of noise.  He said he's a male, typical.  You know, baby wants to pamper when he's sick.  The guy's sick, for God's sake.  All right.  Well, we have to find out for him, what are the odds of him joining the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  No, he can join. 
[00:04:30]  No, see, it's not that simple.  See?  Wait a minute.  All right.  I'm a little...  I'm thinking of the football.  Forget it.  Well, there's a possibility.  There's a possibility.  Now, do you understand what the Tuesday Night...  Yeah, I know what the Hummer Club is, yeah.  Okay.  What's the move tonight, you think?  If he doesn't cough too loud?  Yeah, if he's good and he doesn't complain and...  Yeah.  Yeah, he might just, you know, get a little something tonight.  All right.  What can he do, because he's listening right now, what can he do for you to increase his  odds, let's say? 
[00:05:00]  There must be something you need done around the house.  No, he's too sick, remember?  Well, he's going to be better eventually.  Yeah, eventually.  Maybe he'll hold out until next Tuesday when he's healthy, you know?  Yeah, that'll be good.  Oh, you're just killing the guy.  He's all psyched that he's going to get one tonight, oh?  No, he's good.  He's really good.  And he does a lot of things for me and everything, so I really, I can't complain.  Okay.  All right, so you're going to take his temper to the old-fashioned way?  Yeah.  If that's what he wants, that's going to turn him on, great.  So can you guarantee all of New York that you and your husband will be joining the Tuesday 
[00:05:30]  Night Homer Club tonight?  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  Yeah!  All right, that's what we want to hear.  That's what we want to hear.  Now, you've got to start these things like a grassroots campaign, very personal, we have to call  people.  It's a definite.  Wow, awesome.  Kelly, you rock.  If there's anything we can do for you, you definitely call us back, okay?  All right, and hold on the line.  I think we're going to give you a prize or something.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, hold on.  Take care.  Buddy.  Hello.  Did you hear that?  No, I didn't hear anything.  You didn't hear?  No.  Oh, well. 
[00:06:00]  What happened?  I'm not telling you.  Oh, come on.  You'll find out tonight.  How's that sound?  You're kidding.  I'm just saying, you'll find out tonight.  Yeah, this isn't going to be good.  Just be a good boy.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Catch you later.  I hope you feel better.  I appreciate that.  Hold on the line.  All right.  There you go.  He doesn't even know.  He doesn't even know.  Matt from New York's got a name for it.  Okay.  How about Clean Your Tubes Tuesday?  Well, it's in the right direction.  Also got a fax, the Neil and Bob Association. 
[00:06:30]  I don't think so.  Well, we will accept a better name.  And we got another fax.  Tuesday Night Hummer Club needs an oath.  Yeah, it does need an oath.  We need, like, an oath?  No, an oath.  I will uphold the blah, blah, blah kind of oath?  Yes.  All right.  We'll think of one of those.  If you guys want to come up with an oath and fax that in, we'll read that as well.  2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W.  But the Clean Your Pipes Tuesday.  Clean Your Tubes Tuesday.  All right.  Write that down because I'm going to forget because that's a good one. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  And then we'll have people vote on the best name.  Yeah.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  The Rock of New York 2 for Tuesday.  The Doors, Alabama Song, Whiskey Bar, and Roadhouse Blues.  Van Halen in there as well.  On the way, we got 2 from Zeppelin and the Stone Temple Pilots.  And the phones are going nuts.  Man.  Going absolutely nuts.  We're on to something today.  People are taking the ball and running with it.  Yes, they are.  We have started a new club on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:07:30]  It's very easy to join.  It's called the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Two can chew Tuesday.  Thanks, Diane.  The ladies are really into this, Anthony.  Tuesday's Tube Steak Boogie Club.  Yeah, everyone's trying to come up for a name for this lovely concept.  But basically, we're trying to jumpstart some relationships out there  because we heard from you guys yesterday.  And it sounded like a lot of you guys weren't happy.  Just weren't happy with what's going on at home.  Whether you're a woman or a guy, you know, 
[00:08:00]  there was really no one to blame yesterday.  Fell into a lull in your relationships.  Mm-hmm.  It's a little icebreaker.  A little icebreaker, yes.  We're encouraging the ladies.  Later on today, any time from now until midnight or a little after,  we'll give you a little leeway.  You take care of your husband.  You wah-wah.  You wah-wah.  He's wah-wah.  Yeah.  And then you're an official member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  It's easy.  And Rick is informing me we might have the first official member on the phone line here. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  Oh, let's go.  I believe this guy is Fred.  Hi, N.E.W.  O.B. Anthony.  Yeah.  You guys are gods.  Thank you so much for Hummer Tuesday.  Why?  What happened?  My girlfriend was visiting her friends out in Wontaw,  and I turned her on to N.E.W. when you guys started,  and she was just driving by and she heard Hummer Tuesday,  and she called me on her cell phone.  She's like, is it busy?  And I go, no.  You got any customers?  I go, no.  She goes, I got a surprise for you.  So she stops by. 
[00:09:00]  She's like, lock the doors.  I'm like, why?  Then she wanted to, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  There you go.  I'm not about to say no.  Fred, you're officially the first member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Oh.  How happy are you?  I got a grin on my face from year to year.  There you go.  It's a better world now.  Now, if I had a cigar, it'd be perfect.  Fred, congratulations.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You guys are gods.  Now, remember, when you call our show from now on,  just remind us that you're the first official member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[00:09:30]  All righty, you got it.  All right, brother.  All right, later.  Bye.  Man, the fax is spilling in like crazy here, too.  212-957-WNEW.  This one reads, hey, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club is the ultimate idea I've ever heard.  If all the wives out there would join the club, there would never be any divorce.  Women don't realize all guys want is a good wah-wah and a cheeseburger.  That is what I live for.  Paul from Brooklyn.  We're simple beings.  We are simple beings, men. 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  And a Hummer is just, God, it's such a treat.  It makes me happy for days.  Yeah.  Not hours, days.  Opie and Anthony, my girlfriend just made me a member of your Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  All right, congrats.  Thank you, guys.  You rock.  It's Al from New Jersey checking in.  Another member.  It's like a Hummer telethon going on.  People checking in.  We're going to the tote board.  How many Hummers are we up to officially?  I think two.  I think only two.  That's okay.  We just started.  We've got to start somewhere.  Even Jerry Lewis starts somewhere with his freak show. 
[00:10:30]  Now, this is the type of telethon I'd like to see on TV.  The Hummer telethon.  The Hummer telethon.  Yeah.  Instead of dragging out all the cripples and stuff, you could drag out all the loser guys  that haven't had it in a while.  Look at this poor sap.  He hasn't had one in years.  Come on.  Call up.  Our phones have to keep ringing.  Yeah.  These men need Hummers.  He drove over to the telethon in his minivan.  Oh.  With the baby stuff in the back.  All of a sudden, you turn into a pack mule for baby equipment. 
[00:11:00]  All these guys I knew when I was growing up and my friends.  One guy I knew.  He had this GTO.  We used to go out.  He was so proud of it and everything.  Now, you see him.  He's in a minivan.  And everywhere he goes, he's got the playpen and this big Pampers sack.  And he's pulling things and kids are pulling on his leg.  And I'm just like, God, he was the coolest guy.  He was the guy like you looked up to.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  Well, maybe we could get a spark back into his life.  That's all we're trying to do. 
[00:11:30]  That's all.  We're just trying to help.  Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Now, isn't this much more exciting than listening to DJs just say tunes?  Of course.  Like they've been doing for the last 15 years here.  We are giving back to the community at this point, Anthony.  Trying to help Opie.  Yes.  And another guy checking in on the instant feedback.  Bill says, awesome.  I just called my wife and she's willing to make me an official member.  This is better than marriage counseling.  Keep up the good work.  Look at this.  We're saving marriages.  This rocks. 
[00:12:00]  1027 WNAW.  The Rock of New York.  Super Tuesday with the Stone Temple Pilots.  That's Wicked Garden from the Core CD.  And also, plush.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  On TV, they're showing the footage of the Rockefeller Christmas tree.  I've now seen them cut down the tree for a hundred times.  That was the hundredth time they showed it on TV.  Happens every year.  And, Anthony, did you know this is the first year in a very long time that the tree actually isn't coming from New York State? 
[00:12:30]  Opie, this tree coming from Ohio.  You know, it took this tree 60 years to get to the size it's at.  And just a mere 90 seconds to be cut down by a chainsaw as they loaded onto a military cargo plane.  Which, we talked to the pilot of that plane.  And, yes, it can handle the weight.  I watched the news.  I was drooling at the end of it.  I was just like, da, da, da.  What does that say for mankind?  The tree's been growing for 60, 70 years and we cut it down in 90 seconds. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Just so a bunch of fat housewives can come to Rockefeller Center and screw up our traffic.  I skate under the tree for God's sake.  Let me have a good Christmas.  Tree's sitting there for years.  Little sapling.  Growing up in the perfect spot.  You know how many trees don't ever make it? 
[00:13:30]  The perfect spot to grow that big.  The sun is perfect.  The weather's perfect.  Starting to get a little bigger.  Oh, look.  It survived its little sapling stage, Opie.  And it's growing into a beautiful Christmas tree.  Look.  A little bunny lives under it.  It's a little bunny's home.  Well, what year is it now? 
[00:14:00]  1955.  Wow.  It's been here a while.  It's so big.  Gee, you know, that thing could probably grow and grow and grow for a thousand years.  Oh, look.  It's 1998.  Yeah, this one looks good, Artie.  And it's off.  There it goes.  That's it.  Lovely.  Man.  So, they were talking to the people that work around Rockefeller Center. 
[00:14:30]  They say this time of year is an absolute living hell.  They can't even go to lunch.  They have to eat at like 10 in the morning because lunchtime, it's just everyone going down there to check out the tree.  People work.  Work in this city.  A lot of people forget that.  And they say something like almost 100,000 more cars, additional cars in per day.  Per day.  During the Christmas season.  It's more like 80,000 new cars coming in.  Most of them going to check out the tree. 
[00:15:00]  The tree and shopping and taking pictures.  Look, I'm in front of Tiffany's for God's sake.  Snap my picture.  I'm trying to walk by here.  And they're walking backwards on the sidewalk at you.  Oh, get out of the way.  Hey, Stock Broker Dave's on the line.  He is.  Actually, his new name is Vasectomy Dave because he's hopefully going to get his ballies chopped on our show.  In a couple weeks, I believe.  Vasectomy Dave, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  How's everything?  Good.  Have a good one.  A guy comes up to me today and says he's got some inside info. 
[00:15:30]  He says, Bob Hope does not see Thanksgiving.  So I'm like, get out of here.  He says, Joe DiMaggio's gone before him.  So we got a wager, $1,000.  Who dies first, Bob Hope or Joe DiMaggio?  Oh, man.  I think Bob Hope's going to be around for a while.  I don't think Joe DiMaggio sees Christmas.  No, I don't think so either because they're starting to say it in the paper.  No, he's feeling good lately.  His prognosis is great.  Usually when they say that, they're dead within 24 hours.  He will not see Christmas.  Dave, you're betting $1,000 on celebrity's death. 
[00:16:00]  What, volume a little low today on the floor?  Very slow the last two days, Anthony.  Very slow day, I see.  I've been sitting very slow in the last two days.  When you're betting on celebrity's death.  Meanwhile, I get somebody on the floor sends me 50 cases of mixed vegetables from my testicles.  Yeah, are you going to do that on our show or what?  November 20th.  You're definitely going to get your...  I'm taking one for the team, dude.  Awesome.  He's going to get a vasectomy live on our show.  Ten days, dude.  Ten days.  Ten days.  Ten days and counting before you're on the show live getting your thingy sniffed. 
[00:16:30]  So that's why I've got to get this Hummer Tuesday in.  Yeah, you better take care of it today.  I'm going to be on the show for a while.  All right, Dave.  All right, boys.  Be well.  You got it.  I'll speak to you next week.  Take it easy.  Bye-bye.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, two for Tuesday with Led Zeppelin.  The Croonj, the Crunch from Houses of the Holy and Rock and Roll from Zoso.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We've got another NEW World Premiere broadcast tonight.  The new release from U2, the best of 1980 through 1990.  That's happening at 10 o'clock tonight.  They're going to play an S-load of stuff from the disc and talk to the band. 
[00:17:00]  It's going to be very, very cool.  Yeah.  So keep listening to NEW.  All right?  All right.  Well, we've got to explain our brand new concept.  We've got a ton of new listeners checking us out for the first time because they had to work until 5 o'clock.  We have started the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, Anthony.  The Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  This stems from our conversations we were having with you guys yesterday where we came away from yesterday's show thinking a lot of people aren't happy with what's going on at home. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  We found out that people have been married or in relationships for many years.  They fall into a rut where sex goes to the side.  You just don't get it anymore.  And it's hard to break the ice again.  You can't walk up to your significant other and, you know, hey, baby, how about a...  Yeah.  You know, because you're embarrassed.  You don't want to, you know, get away from me, you pervert, or I'm not in the mood or something.  Speaking for most guys, I must say I enjoy a good wah-wah-wah every once in a while. 
[00:18:00]  Well, who doesn't, for God's sake?  And all we're saying is if we bring this up on the air and leave it out there in the open, you're going to be home later.  Your wife or girlfriend is going to be there or your boyfriend.  I don't care who you go out with.  This could work many different ways, I guess.  Who cares?  But all of a sudden you're going to kind of start laughing and going, oh, you hear what those wacky bastards did today?  Yeah, on any W.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, I think your chances of getting something are greatly increased, Anthony. 
[00:18:30]  Everyone will be a lot happier, we think.  That's why we are just saying that on every Tuesday, from today on, every Tuesday...  Every Tuesday.  When the guy gets home, you're together, give the poor guy a little something.  A little ah-ah-ah-ah.  Take his wah-wah and give him a wah-wah-wah.  Now, because I'm sure there'll be some reciprocal acts that go on after that.  Well, we are getting...  But it's all up to the...  It's pretty much we know how this works. 
[00:19:00]  It's usually the lady's choice.  It really is.  You ladies have complete control in most cases.  It's always all these time constraints and this and that.  And I'm not...  Let's just set it aside.  Here it is.  Here's your opportunity.  Your window of opportunity we're giving you.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  That's it.  You have a bowling league.  You go play darts every Thursday.  Well, Tuesday is the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  You want to be a member, you just take care of the deed.  Now, Michelle from New York brings up a great point here. 
[00:19:30]  Dear Opie and Anthony, I would like to join the Hummer Club, but I have one question.  What about our needs?  What do we get?  Please answer on the air.  Well, we're hoping the guys will reciprocate and do whatever makes you happy.  Yes.  This gets the ball rolling.  This gets the ball rolling.  We have to start somewhere.  Right.  And we could go the other way and say, okay, now guys, go home and satisfy your woman in  that fashion.  Uh-huh.  But that doesn't guarantee that the guy's going to get his uh-uh-uh. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  And we all love the uh-uh-uh.  So that's why we're starting here.  Starting with ladies, please, on Tuesday, give your guys the uh-uh-uh.  And we just did the math really quickly here.  Members are joining our club every five minutes.  Oh, this is great.  Since, since, uh, 350 today, the membership is going up every five minutes.  Isn't that great?  So here's one from Johnny B.  Johnny B writes, boys, I was just meeting an official member while driving home with 
[00:20:30]  my girlfriend.  Thank God for tinted windows.  And this guy, Mike, this is hysterical because earlier we called some guy's wife to help  him out and talk her into doing it tonight.  And she agreed.  Mike writes, please, for the love of God, call my wife.  Call her now at work.  Here's her number.  Call.  Please call.  Her name is Jody.  Please.  I, I thank you.  See, now there's a guy who would just be so happy if he got home and she was waiting 
[00:21:00]  there with open arms and other things.  Well, it doesn't have to.  Other things.  We don't want to put the pressure on it.  It doesn't have to happen as soon as the guy gets home.  Maybe just sometime tonight.  Maybe when he least expects it, actually, it would be even more fun.  But it just gives you the opportunity to discuss it.  Mm-hmm.  And you guys got complete freedom.  You don't want, you don't feel like doing it.  That's fine.  But our membership will grow.  And we are looking for the official oath.  Yeah.  Anthony and I being the grand poobahs of this lovely club. 
[00:21:30]  Do we get some wacky hats like they had on the Flintstones?  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  Like the lodge hat.  The water buffaloes.  The water buffaloes.  Yeah.  I don't know whether you'll, like, wear a big penis hat.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And do we have, like, a special handshake, maybe?  Because when we're out and about, we can see if you're an official member or not just by the handshake.  Woo-woo!  Where are those, where's that lawyer thing?  The lawyer's not in effect.  Yeah.  Additional comments. 
[00:22:00]  Here's the oath of membership for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Well, as according to them, we haven't made these official yet.  Yeah.  I state your name.  Hereby swear to uphold, preserve, and protect the constitution of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  This oath will entail faithful adherence to the following.  Hummers every Tuesday without fail.  This is not a one-night splurge.  Or splooge.  Members will reciprocate.  This is not one-sided.  Members may not drive minivans unless, of course, a Hummer is given in a minivan, in which case the members may continue to use the vehicle. 
[00:22:30]  What?  That sounds great to anyone driving a minivan.  Yes.  All right.  Well, this lady has sent in some rules.  This is really good.  And she's already emailing it to everyone.  It's becoming junk mail on the Internet, which is good.  We need the help here.  Yeah.  So we can grow the show.  Wah-wah etiquette.  Rules for men.  Number one.  First and foremost, we are not obligated to do it. 
[00:23:00]  Number two.  So if you get one, be grateful.  Number three.  I don't care what they did in the porn video you saw.  It is not standard practice to wah-wah on my wah-wah.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  Number four.  No, I don't have to.  Formal.  Number five.  My ears are not handled.  Number six.  Do not push on the top of my head. 
[00:23:30]  I can't even read that one on the air.  Sorry.  Oh, come on.  I got to see it.  Number seven.  This is wah-wah etiquette.  Rules for men.  I don't care how relaxed you get.  It is never okay to fart.  Oh, please.  Is that even necessary to say?  Well, you said you wanted to hear it.  Having my period does not mean that it's wah-wah week.  Get it through your head.  I'm bloated and I feel like S.  So no, I don't feel particularly obligated to wah-wah just because you won't have sex right now. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, this is starting to sound like why you don't get a...  I know.  Anything.  Number nine.  Blue balls might have worked on high school girls.  If you're that desperate, go wah-wah yourself and leave me alone with my Midol.  Oh, I can't read that one.  All right.  Number 11.  Leaving me in bed while you go play video games immediately afterwards is highly inadvisable  if you would like my behavior to be repeated in the future. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  It's like a golf swing.  You need a good follow-through, guys.  Oh, number 12.  This is wah-wah etiquette.  Rules for men.  If you like how we do it, it's probably best not to speculate about the origins of our talent.  Just enjoy the moment and be happy that we're good at it.  Can't read that one.  No, I will not do it while you watch TV.  Oh, bogus.  That's kind of lame anyway.  You should be watching TV. 
[00:25:00]  Number 15.  Interesting.  When you hear your friends complain about how they don't get wah-wah, often enough, keep  your mouth shut.  It is inappropriate to either sympathize or brag.  Okay.  The TV thing is good, though, because I know there have been times, you know, you're in the  throes of it, and I've glanced at the TV, and it can ruin the moment when you see, you know,  this is young Maria.  Her village is starving.  You're like, ah.  All of a sudden, where is it? 
[00:25:30]  All of a sudden, you're like, ah.  Ah, out of steam.  All right.  Another fact coming in here really fast.  Hey, guys, me and my girl are just finished joining your club.  We worked together, and we were just in the boss's office.  The mice will play while the cat's away.  Wah-wah.  Wow.  Oh, by the way, does it matter if we're both girls?  Debbie and Donna have joined the club. 
[00:26:00]  Welcome, girls.  Oh, official members of the N.E.W. Rock on a Wah for a Wah Club.  Okay, good.  Ah.  I don't even know what to say about that.  So I think we're on our way.  All right.  I believe we need some ladies to call to take the official oath for the Tuesday night  Hummer Club, Anthony.  Yes, Dice.  Andrew Dice Clay will be delivering the oath.  The oath.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday.  David Bowie, Rebel Rebel.  Did you see the version that Iggy Pop and Lenny Kravitz did on the VH1 Fashion Awards? 
[00:26:30]  Pretty good.  Un-freaking-believable.  Yeah.  The show was actually a complete bore because they decided this year not to allow nipples  to show through the clothing like they've done in past years during the Fashion Awards.  But Iggy Pop and Lenny Kravitz came on stage and did that song.  Unbelievable.  They should release that thing.  It was great.  Good chap.  It truly was.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We are discussing our new concept today on the show, the Tuesday night Hummer Club. 
[00:27:00]  Members are being inducted pretty much every five minutes now at this point.  Yeah, we realized yesterday a lot of people are miserable in their relationships and married  and, you know, kids and for some reason sex gets put on the back burner.  We're just trying to bring it to the forefront again.  Yeah.  Every Tuesday, how about a Hummer?  Yeah.  How about it?  It's easy.  And guys, we're encouraging you to reciprocate in whatever way the lady likes.  But we have to get the thing rolling.  Whatever she's into, yes.  So we're just saying on Tuesday, anytime Tuesday, how about, you know, the lady gives the guy a oh, oh, oh. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, and I know there's a lot of guys that are on their way home now going, oh, my God, my girl doesn't even listen to any W.  Well, you know what you got to do.  Make sure she's listening at the worst next Tuesday.  Yeah.  And we'll break the ice to her.  And then you could go, hey, do you know, we're listening to the radio today?  Boy, you hear what those idiots are doing?  Yeah, that whole, you know, Hummer thing.  It's pretty stupid, right? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, just play it down.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, it's going to happen, I'm telling you.  Yeah, that's stupid.  Yeah, well, I guess it's time to give the official oath to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah.  And we honestly don't want to do this.  Usually, we despise when the Dice Man is on our show.  Shut your mouth and let me do this.  Because you've finally done something on the radio show that's kind of funny, and it's  kind of good, and it's kind of helpful to the guys out there that might not be, you know, 
[00:28:30]  sexually satisfied.  Well, we were sick of waiting for you to come up with something funny for our show.  I don't get paid to come up with funny stuff for your show, huh?  Well, why do you sit in the lobby, you know, patiently waiting for us to call you to come  into our show?  I got people, that's not a here nor there.  I'm listening.  I kind of appreciate what you two A-holes is doing for the guys out there.  Yeah.  Because it's hard to just say, hey, honey, how about you throw me one? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Because you get, oh, my jaw hurts.  Oh, you hurt me today.  Hey, come here, honey.  Biggie!  You know, it's hard.  A guy can't ask for this.  Yeah.  It's just got to happen.  All right.  Huh?  So I'd be willing to come in here and give the girls the Oat of Orifice or Oat of Orifice  as it were, huh?  Now, Dyson, can you describe a way the ladies could approach their men tonight? 
[00:29:30]  With their mouth open.  What are you talking about, approach?  Wacky-bicky!  How else you want them to approach, huh?  From the rear.  What's wrong with you?  Approach from the front, with your mouth open, honey.  Oh!  I was thinking more like, you know, the cute, cuddly...  Look, he's talking out his ass again.  All right, forget it.  He's talking out his ass.  All right, shut up!  What's wrong with you?  Huh?  Turn my mic up!  No.  You snapper head! 
[00:30:00]  No, I'm not turning it.  My God.  Look how silly you look over there without a microphone.  Without a microphone, I'm better than you two asses.  Look how silly you look.  Look at you.  Hey, screw yourself, huh?  Yeah, look, you need me to turn on your microphone, don't you?  Let me talk to the broad.  Yeah, look at you.  You're pathetic when the mic's not on.  Snap out.  Look at you.  Don't get me going.  Yeah, don't get you going.  Look at you.  You look pathetic.  If I've got to come over to that side of the board, I'm going to get an ass with you.  And why aren't you actually smoking the cigarettes anymore? 
[00:30:30]  Why do you just have it in your hand?  Because I've got a love for cigarettes.  I just don't got a love for kids.  Oh, so this is your way of looking cool or something?  At least I got a way of looking cool, huh?  Yeah.  Turn my mic up.  Turn it up.  All right, there it is.  How dare you try to silence one of the comic geniuses of our time?  Andrew Dice Clay.  Now, put the broads on.  I want to induct them into the hammer thingy. 
[00:31:00]  All right, here's the deal.  We've got like five ladies on hold, and you can talk to them.  Okay, Dice?  Okay, put the whores on.  All right, ladies, you guys ready to take the oath?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go.  And every single one of you are going to become a member tonight?  Absolutely.  Okay.  All right, here's Andrew Dice Clay, everyone.  Hey, ladies, how you doing, honey?  Hey, Andrew.  Hey, you're so hot, huh?  Absolutely.  He's all ready to throw your husbands a good one.  Okay.  Or your boys or whatever, huh? 
[00:31:30]  Hey, forget about it.  All right, repeat after me, huh?  I state your name.  I state your name.  Yeah, there's a bunch of smart asses open.  Do solemnly swear.  Do solemnly swear.  That on each Tuesday evening.  That on each Tuesday evening.  I will, with all my ability, faithfully execute.  My ability.  Yeah.  Can you get it together, sweethearts?  This ain't a quilting beer, right? 
[00:32:00]  Faithfully execute upon my significant other.  Faithfully execute upon my significant other.  The act of.  The act of.  The act of.  Honing the knob.  Honing the knob.  Buffing the captain's helmet.  Licking the purple blow pop.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on, girls.  Get it together, huh?  We're licking the purple blow pop. 
[00:32:30]  Kissing the trouser schnauzer.  Kissing the trouser schnauzer.  Inflating the pink balloon.  Inflating the pink balloon.  Diddle the giggle stick.  Diddle the giggle stick.  Tasting the salty pickle.  I don't know about that.  Tasting the salty pickle.  Just say it, honey.  Yeah.  Tasting the salty pickle.  And fishing for the one-eyed trouser trout.  And fishing for the one-eyed trouser trout. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I hereby induct you into the.  What?  Tuesday evening, pecker club, whatever.  Hey, good idea, fellas.  I like this one.  Bring on the chicks.  First good idea you had in five months.  Yeah, but see, my husband won't need a towel.  All right, ladies.  All right.  Go on and conquer, okay?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  And there they go.  Where did you get these girls, huh?  Hey, easy.  They're our listeners.  I don't care.  They don't even know how to talk right. 
[00:33:30]  I'm trying to tell them they're out of office.  And they can't even talk.  Yeah, maybe you'd be better with something in their mouths.  All right.  Do you want to do Brady Bunch trivia still, Anthony?  We said we were going to do it yesterday.  Yeah, we got some good prizes for you.  Yeah, what do we got?  Yeah, what do we got?  I think we have, like, the Aerosmith Live CD and stuff.  And we'll throw in, like, a little CD package.  Yeah, we'll throw something together.  Throw something together.  Basically, Anthony is the king of trivia.  Well, I was saying yesterday how I hate shows like ER and stuff because they're depressing. 
[00:34:00]  And I just instantly punch out over to Nickelodeon.  Right.  And for years I've done that.  And, you know, I watch pretty stupid shows.  And I know everything.  I suck all the stuff up.  You know pretty much everything about the Brady Bunch?  Yeah, the Brady Bunch is one of the shows that just, like, uses this information that's stuck in my head.  I also know you're the king of Star Trek trivia, too.  The originals.  Yeah, none of that next generation crap.  Just the original Star Trek runs.  All right.  Basically, what we're going to do, call up right now at 212-757-1027 if you've got a Brady Bunch trivia question. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  We're going to put everyone on live so there's no games being played here.  And the first person to stump Anthony will win this lovely CD prize package, okay?  Could be the first person.  Could be the first person.  And then you look like a big a-hole, but...  Well, sometimes they come up with some ridiculous questions, too, you know.  Yeah.  What type tires were on the Brady car?  Don't even hit me with those.  Yeah, don't go there.  Keep it interesting, okay?  All right.  All right, we'll do that next. 
[00:35:00]  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Lenny Kravitz always on the run from Mama Sid and his latest flyaway before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  We'll be talking about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club a little more because there's a bunch of people that have been inducted.  As our show continues to roll along here.  But right now, we want to play Brady Bunch trivia.  All right.  Because Anthony amazes a lot of people around here with his memory of the Brady Bunch.  I know.  And I just want to see how far he can go before someone stumps you with a question. 
[00:35:30]  Ridiculous knowledge I have.  Yes.  All right.  And we do have a prize package, right, Rick?  What do we got?  Some CDs and a t-shirt.  Okay, that's good enough.  We'll put something really cool together for you guys, all right?  So the first person to stump Anthony will win the prize package.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  If you've got some trivia, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Hi, who's this?  This is Brian.  All right, Brian.  What's your Brady Bunch trivia question for Anthony?  What junior high school did they go to? 
[00:36:00]  Fillmore Junior High.  Ah.  F-F-F-I-L-L-L-M-O-O-O-O-R-E.  Fillmore Junior High.  There you go.  Hi, who's this?  Is this freaking Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, I love you guys.  Thanks, man.  All right.  What street do they live on?  The Brady's.  Uh.  Ah, come on, dude.  Clinton.  Clinton.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  I remember it was like Bill Clinton.  Sure.  Bill Clinton.  Clinton Street.  Hi, Eddie W.  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  What's your trivia question?  What was the name of the guy that Marsha had a date with when she broke her nose? 
[00:36:30]  The big man on campus.  The big man on campus.  The big man on campus.  Oh, yeah.  Um, uh, Doug Simpson.  Ah.  Big man on campus.  You got it.  Thanks for listening.  Wow, you're up to three already.  Three?  Yeah.  That's not bad.  Hi, Eddie W.  Eddie W.  Hi there.  Hi.  What's your trivia question?  The question is this.  On the driving test between Greg and Marsha, how did it end?  And what was the final test that had to be done?  Oh, that's easy. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, they did the little obstacle course with the cones in the parking lot.  And the first one to break the egg off the cone lost.  Yeah, but let's say they both made it to the end.  What was the final test?  If they both made it to the end?  Yeah.  Which they both did.  They both made it to the end of the test without breaking the egg.  Well, they did it again.  And then the...  No, that's not what happened.  The egg broke because Greg choked.  No, they had it come closest to the cone without knocking the cone over. 
[00:37:30]  So they said the egg on the cone.  Oh, stop it.  What did I just say?  No, that's not what you said.  Yeah, he said the first one to break the egg and the egg was on top of the cone.  The egg was on the cone.  All right.  Knock.  Jesus.  Greg choked.  Hit the gas.  Oh, please.  We're going to give that one to you after four.  Hi, Eddie W.  Hi, how you doing?  All right.  What's your name?  Hey, my name's Peter.  All right, Peter.  Peter Brady.  Almost.  This is kind of an oddball trivia question because it's not like a who did what when. 
[00:38:00]  But, Anthony, you ready for this?  All right.  Did we as viewers ever get to see what the original Mrs. Brady looked like, the boy's mother?  Yeah.  In like the first episode, it was a picture, though.  You are right.  Yeah.  I love that one.  Anthony's up to five.  I think she was even hotter than Carol.  She was a smoker.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Hi, Eddie W.  Yeah.  Hey, there was an episode where Jan made up a fake boyfriend.  What was his name?  Oh.  That would be George Glass. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  That's good.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  I would have got that one.  Hi, Eddie W.  Hi, it's me, still.  Hi, me, still.  What's your trivia question?  We got you live in the air.  Okay.  My question is, when the kids got really mad at Alice, and she sort of was forced to  leave the Brady household, and she didn't do anything wrong, she didn't really mean to  do anything, there was a maid who came in who was substituted for Alice. 
[00:39:00]  What was the maid's name?  Oh, that is a toughie.  Uh-oh.  Let's see.  I know way too much about the Bradys, too.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That's a good one.  She might win the prize package, don't we?  Okay, let's see.  The maid that took over for Alice.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Yeah, on the spot.  And she was mean.  Yeah, she was.  She was.  She got him up in the morning to do, like, calisthenics and stuff.  No, that was Alice's cousin.  Cousin, yeah.  Oh, the other one.  Oh, okay. 
[00:39:30]  The other one.  She was just kind of a load.  She really didn't do much.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, I can't remember her name, though.  You win.  I do.  Yeah.  Great.  Her name was Kay.  Kay.  Remember, at the end, she said, that was Alice.  Alice, I'm Kay.  Yeah.  Bitch.  All right.  All right.  Well, you win.  Thank you.  That's good.  Anthony made it to seven.  What's your name?  My name is Thea.  Hi.  Are you going to be a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club tonight?  Oh, sure.  She doesn't even know what it is.  Keep listening.  We'll explain it one more time, okay? 
[00:40:00]  All right.  All right.  Thanks for listening.  All right.  Thank you.  Hold on the line.  Oh, that wasn't bad, though, Anne.  You made it to seven.  Yeah, but I, I don't know.  I kind of feel like Cindy when she choked on that show, the kid show.  That was a tough one, though.  We could give it another round in a little while.  All right.  We still have Thea on the line because Rick just told us that she has a very unusual last  name.  Oh, she does.  She was the one that just won the Brady Bunch trivia thing we just did.  Yeah.  Thea.  Yes.  All right.  What's your last name?  My last name is Orifiche. 
[00:40:30]  What is it?  Orifiche.  Orifiche.  Orifiche.  How do you spell it?  O-R-E-F as in Frank.  I-C-E.  That's Orifiche.  Your last name is Orifiche.  Orifiche.  Thea Orifiche.  You guys are cracking me up.  Come on.  What do you call it?  I can't.  What?  What do you call your last name?  Mike, we say it in, we say Orifiche. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I don't care.  I don't care what language you say it in.  It is Orifiche.  Yeah, I know.  Like they ever pronounce it like that during attendance in school.  It was always...  No, actually.  The Orifiche.  Orifiche.  Is the Orifiche here?  Oh, my God.  All right.  We had to go back to you real fast.  Thank you.  Okay.  You've taken enough abuse, I'm sure, over the years.  I know my whole life.  We'll let you go.  Well, she stumped me.  Obviously, she was in watching the Brady Bunch because she couldn't go out of the house with  the name like that.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, that's too much.  Godzilla!  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, Blue Oyster Cult, Godzilla.

You think we could like drink this pint of Jack and be sober before our parents pick us  up?  Yeah, you get the visine.  I think we could pull it off.  Let's go for it.  Yeah, sure.  Then your parents come to pick you up.  What did you say?  Okay, here they come in.  Be cool.  Be cool.  Be cool.  Yeah, that's going to take away from all the pot and booze and everything else.

My girl called me while the dice man was inducting the inductees.  She pledged along with the other girls to me over the phone.  Tuesday night, here I come.  Very good.  Of a happy customer.  Congratulations to Richie.  All right.  Man, hey, we're doing something cool with Bruce Springsteen.  Every time we play Bruce Springsteen on the radio, we're giving away tracks, Bruce's new box set,

Yes, we got our copy yesterday, and I tracked through it, and it was quite enjoyable, to say the least.  All right.  Very happy for you.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with Nirvana. 
[00:45:30]  Off Nevermind Lithium and Smells Like Teen Spirit before that.  Sophie and Anthony closing up shop for another day.  Actually, we've got to do one more thing before we get out of here.  Yes.  An email coming in like crazy about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Raymond writes, I'm an official member as of 5.15 p.m. tonight.  All right.  Where do I send my dues?  He goes on to say, it was like a lion attacking a wounded deer on the Animal Kingdom show. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Congratulations, Ray.  But I think we need to try to take care of someone before we leave here, Anthony.  This is getting like a public service show, isn't it, Ope?  Yes, it is.  We're like a Hummer welfare.  Poor guys that aren't getting the Hummers are coming to us and saying, please help me.  Yes.  You know, so we start this Tuesday Hummer Club, and people are coming out of the woodwork.  And we're doing this every Tuesday.  This isn't a one-shot deal. 
[00:46:30]  You know, but as soon as you get initiated once, that's good enough.  We can't ask for miracles here.  Guys.  Yeah.  Please.  I mean, but if you become a member, please get a hold of us tomorrow, whether through the  fax line or the email overnight or whatever, okay?  We've got to come up with a patch or a lapel pin.  Yeah.  Or something so you can walk down the street and proudly display the fact that you have  been inducted.  And someone, please design the grand poobah hats for Anthony and I.  We want to fax in some designs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can fax in the designs. 
[00:47:00]  We know we have some artists out there that can probably come up with some good designs.  Yeah, we'll get them made up and next time we do a public appearance, we'll wear our grand  poobah hats, okay?  Or how about like your car?  You know how fighter planes, you used to draw like the old Japanese planes when you used  to shoot them down?  Yeah.  You could put like a splooge stain on your door of your car for each one you get.  But no one will know the difference.  If you're driving to New York, you get that crap on your car anyway.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, please help.  I would love to join your Tuesday Night Hummer Club, but my wife Sue doesn't listen to your 
[00:47:30]  show.  Can you call her at home and tell her of the wonderful program you're trying to start?  Here's her number.  If you could pull this off, I will become a fan forever.  Thanks, John.  How could we deny this guy?  That's worth it.  I'm calling up Sue for John here.  Let's, I guess we'll have to talk her through it, Ant.  We have to.  All right.  Hello?  Hi, is Sue there?  Yeah, who is this?  Opie and Anthony.  Hold on one second. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  John?  Yes.  We'll take care of you.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Hello?  Hi, Sue.  Hello.  It's Opie and Anthony from WNEW Radio.  Hi.  How are you?  We got you live in the air.  Is that okay?  Um, yeah.  Yeah, I guess.  Well, your husband, John, asked us to give you a little ring.  Oh, okay.  Uh, we really don't know how to tell you this, but we'll try tactfully, okay?  Okay.  Anthony, why don't you tell her?  Well, we've, uh, come up with a little, uh, concept, little idea, um, on Tuesdays. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  Uh, I think it's something that'll make, uh, a lot of people happy.  That's a good thing, right?  Right.  And, um, I think the stress of a hard day's work, uh, kind of builds up.  Uh, how long have you guys been married?  Uh, seven, seven years.  Yeah, seven years.  You know, you start fall, you start getting into a couple of ruts in life, right?  Right.  A couple of things get put on back burners for other things, right?  Exactly. 
[00:49:00]  And maybe, let's just say, some intimacy suffers.  Mm-hmm.  You know, you're not maybe, uh, as intimate as you used to be.  Right.  Well, we've come up with a concept, uh, here, um, it's called, uh...  The Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  The Tuesday Night Hummer Club, yes.  Oh.  And, um...  We're encouraging the ladies to, you know, take the guys, wah, wah, and, you know, wah, wah.  Uh-huh.  On Tuesday nights.  And if you would do this deed for him, he would be an official member of our lovely little club. 
[00:49:30]  It's hard for a guy to just come out and ask for this, and we understand that, so we're, we're breaking the ice here, and he would really enjoy, uh, you know, like the old days, one of those good old-fashioned, ah, ah, you know?  Uh-huh.  So, what do you say, Sue?  What do you say?  Can you induct him?  Look at the guy.  You could probably, look at him.  Look at him.  Look how pathetic he looks over there.  Poor guy.  He's probably staring at you.  He looks like a deer with, with the, you know, he's caught in headlights over there. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  Some simple pledges in life that don't even cost anything.  Oh.  And that's one of them, and he would really, uh, really enjoy that.  Oh, okay.  So, we figured we would ask you for him.  Will you give him a Hummer tonight?  Um, I guess.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, come on.  All right.  Come on.  That's what we want to hear.  That's great.  Oh, please.  Bless your heart.  I know John would appreciate it, and I guarantee he's going to be a, a real good guy for the 
[00:50:30]  next few days at the, at the worst.  Oh, okay.  Uh, and if you promise to give him, uh, a Hummer, we will, um, we will give you a prize.  Oh, okay.  So, you will give it to him?  Yeah.  You will?  Of course.  All right.  You are great.  Look at that.  Can we, can we talk to John really fast?  Sure.  And hold on, because we're going to give you a prize, too.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Hello?  John.  Yeah.  You're in. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  You're in, man.  Yeah, I didn't think you guys were going to call, because she was just getting ready  to go down and lay down and get some sleep, because she, uh, works tonight.  Well, now she's got to go down somewhere else.  Yeah, that's right.  All right, tell us how it is tomorrow.  Then I will.  We're all patiently waiting.  Okay, I'll fax you again.  You owe us, pal.  Okay, thank you very much.  All right.  All right, man.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, that was easy.  Opie, damn it, if we have to do it one at a time like that.  We'll do it.  If we have to do it one at a time for you guys, we will.  You just got to promise that you have to listen to us forever. 
[00:51:30]  Forever.  Forever if we do this favor for you.  You know, another station out there might get you concert tickets.  They might play your song request.  Hey, that's kind of cool.  You get a little dedication to your girlfriend.  How cute.  That's really kind of neat.  Yeah.  Maybe even the chance to win $10,000 at some big giveaway.  Which, by the way, no one wins.  Of course not.  Okay.  Who's getting your Hummers?  Right. 
[00:52:00]  People, who's getting your Hummers?  It's the Opie and Anthony show getting your Hummers.  This is Pimp Radio.  Pimp Radio.  I am Stix Franklin.  It's Pimp Radio.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Look at the time.  Yeah, we got to go.  The phone's ringing like crazy.  New members being inducted by the second at this point.  See the power of the show?  Some people know how to use it.  Yes.  Some people use it for good.  Yeah.  Not evil. 
[00:52:30]  Yes.  Like John just did.  He called up.  We phoned his wife.  He's in Hummer Heaven.  Yes.  There you go.  Right about now, something very good is happening at John's house.  Great.  Do we have his number?  We should call him back.  Shut up.  Where is the number?  That would be funny as hell, because I know they're probably in the middle of it right  now.  Hello?  All right.  We got to go in there.  Come on. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  John can't come to the floor.  All right, Ed.  All right, man.  Thanks for listening.  We appreciate it.  Good luck with, you know, joining the club tonight.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time. </pre>
