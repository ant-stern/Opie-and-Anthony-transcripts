<pre> One oh two seven W.A.W. The Rock of New York two for Tuesday Van Halen.  Everybody wants some.  That song is very appropriate to what we're talking about today on the program.  It's Sophie and Anthony and the revolution continues here.  Yeah, today is sort of maybe a solution that we were trying to think up for yesterday's  show.  Yesterday's show ended on a note where we were kind of seeing a lot of people were miserable  and everyone was sad and they went home kind of feeling kind of empty and they resigned  to the fact that this is their life. 
[00:30]
 They're married now.  Their dating life might have been great.  They married and something happened along the way where they're just not as happy anymore,  not as sexually active and that's causing some problems in the marriage.  Well we tried to think of a quick fix and I think this is a good one.  Opie came up with an idea, a brainstorm last night.  Brainstormed a little bit and we came up with the concept the Tuesday Night Humor Club.  If you come up with a better name for this, we'll definitely accept it because we like  to get the people involved with our show.  212-957-WNAW is the fact line. 
[01:00]
 But basically we're encouraging the ladies sometime today on Tuesday to give their man  or their lady friend, I don't care who you go out with, just give them a wah-wah to their  wah-wah-wah.  The Humor Club.  The Humor Club.  Easy as that.  Simple as that.  And the ladies we've talked to thus far on our show, they're all for it, Anthony.  Very receptive.  Sometimes you just need an icebreaker.  I don't know what happens when you're dating, you go at it like rabbits. 
[01:30]
 I remember there were times I came home for lunch from work.  Boom!  There you go.  You're going at it.  And then something happens along the way and things slow down.  You don't know why.  Maybe distractions, kids, the job, the pressure.  I don't know what it is.  But this is an icebreaker now where on Tuesday nights the guy can go home and go like, you  know, I just might get something tonight.  I might get that a little hot.  You're at dinner and you both listen to our show, you're going to kind of smile and go,  did you hear what those wackos were talking about today? 
[02:00]
 And it's all fun and games.  And then next thing you know it's probably going to happen.  A little opportunity.  You're sitting at home, maybe you're sipping a little wine.  Yeah.  A little dinner, a little wine.  You're feeling a little fun.  And then all of a sudden you're like, did you hear Opie and Anthony today?  Oh, it's the Tuesday thing.  Boy, that's crazy, huh?  Yeah.  Before you know it.  So what do you say?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the opportunity to break the ice a little.  So ladies, take it and we have a guy in the line who needs a little help. 
[02:30]
 All right.  He needs our help.  Hi, Andy W.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  All right.  Listen, I was hoping perhaps you could help me join your club.  How can we help you?  I'm a bit at a disadvantage.  Well, first of all, let me ask you this.  Does it have to be with your wife?  We don't really care how it happens.  Okay.  Because that's up to you.  We're hoping it would be if you're married with your wife.  That's the proper thing.  Because I mean, we're just trying to help people out there a little miserable in their  relationship.  Well, speak about misery. 
[03:00]
 I've been sick for about four or five days now.  My head's about to explode.  Basically, my wife has turned into Nurse Ratched.  And Nurse Ratched informed me yesterday morning that I'm coughing too loudly now.  So when she gets home from work tonight, I don't know what the chances are.  So I need you to reach out for me.  Okay.  Can you do that?  Yeah.  What do you want us to do?  Her name's Kelly.  You want to give her a call?  All right.  Hold on.  We're going to call her while you're on the air here.  Okay, cool.  We'll do all the talking.  Don't say a word. 
[03:30]
 Hello?  Kelly?  Yeah.  Hi.  It's Opien Anthony from NAW Radio.  Hello.  Hi.  You listen to us?  Yes, I do.  Oh, cool.  We got you live in the air, if that's okay.  Do you?  Yeah.  Did you hear what we started today?  No.  I only had you on for part of the day.  Well, we started the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah, I heard all about that.  Oh, you did?  Already?  Well, a little about it yesterday.  I heard what you were doing bashing married people and everything else.  No, we really weren't bashing married people.  We were just exposing the misery that a lot of married couples are in. 
[04:00]
 And it just happens that you fall into it over the years.  Now, your husband's homesick.  Yes.  And he wants...  He called you.  Yes, I am.  Okay.  He says you're starting to act like Nurse Ratched.  I've always been like Nurse Ratched.  I'm not starting.  You said he's coughing too loudly?  Yeah, he makes a lot of noise.  He said he's a male typical, you know, baby once he came to camp or when he's sick.  The guy's sick for you.  I'm not sick for you.  I'm not sick for you.  I'm not sick for you.  I'm not sick for you.  I'm not sick for God's sake.  Well, we have to find out for him what are the odds of him joining the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club.  Oh, he can join. 
[04:30]
 No, see, it's not that simple.  See?  Wait a minute.  All right, I'm a little off-taken to the football.  I forgot it.  Well, there's a possibility.  There's a possibility.  Do you understand what the Tuesday Night...  Yeah, I know what the Hummer Club is, yeah.  Okay.  What's the move tonight, you think?  If he doesn't cough too loud?  Yeah, if he's good and he doesn't complain.  Yeah, he might just, you know, make a little noise.  All right, what can he do, because he's listening right now, what can he do for you to increase  his odds, let's say?  There must be something you need done around the house. 
[05:00]
 No, he's too sick, remember?  Well, he's going to be better eventually.  Yeah, eventually.  Maybe hold out until next Tuesday when he's healthy, you know?  Yeah, that'll be good.  Oh, you're just killing the guy.  He's all psyched that he's going to get one tonight, oh.  No, he's really good.  He's really good.  He does a lot of things for me and everything, so I really, I can't complain.  Okay.  All right, so you're going to take a stamp to the old-fashioned way.  Yeah.  Yeah, if that's what he wants, that's going to turn him on, great.  So can you guarantee all of New York that you and your husband will be joining the Tuesday 
[05:30]
 Night Hummer Club tonight?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah!  All right, that's what we want to hear.  That's what we want to hear.  You know, you've got to start these things like a grassroots campaign, very personal,  we have to call people.  It's a definite.  Wow, awesome.  Kelly, you rock.  If there's anything we can do for you, you definitely call us back, okay?  All right.  All right, and hold on the line.  I think we're going to give you a prize or something.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, hold on.  Take care.  Buddy!  Hello?  Did you hear that?  No, I didn't hear anything.  You didn't hear?  No. 
[06:00]
 Oh, well.  What happened?  I'm not telling you.  Oh, come on.  You'll find out tonight.  How's that sound?  You're kidding.  I'm just saying, you'll find out tonight.  Yeah, this isn't going to be good.  Just be a good boy.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  How does he feel about it?  I appreciate it.  Hold on the line.  All right.  There you go.  He doesn't even know.  He doesn't even know.  Matt from New York's got a name for it.  Okay.  How about Clean Your Tubes Tuesday?  It's in the right direction.  I also got a fax. 
[06:30]
 The Neil and Bob Association.  I don't think so.  Well, we will accept a better name.  And we got another fax.  Tuesday Night Hummer Club needs an oath.  Yeah, it does need an oath.  We need like an oath.  I will uphold the blah blah blah kind of oath.  Yes.  We'll think of one of those.  If you guys want to come up with an oath, we'll read that as well.  212-957-WNEW.  But the Clean Your Pipes Tuesday.  Clean Your Tubes Tuesday.  All right.  Write that down because I'm going to forget because that's a good one. 
[07:00]
 And then we'll have people vote on the best name.  Yeah.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Tube for Tuesday.  The Doors.  Alabama Song.  And Roadhouse Blues.  Van Halen in there as well.  On the way, we got two from Zeppelin and the Stone Temple Pilots.  And the folks are going nuts.  Man, going absolutely nuts.  We're onto something today.  People are taking the ball and running with it.  Yes, they are.  We have started a new club on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[07:30]
 It's very easy to join.  It's called the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Two can chew Tuesday.  Thanks, Diane.  The ladies are really into this, Anthony.  Tuesday's Tube Steak Boogie Club.  Yeah, everyone's trying to come up for a name for this lovely concept.  But basically, we're trying to jumpstart some relationships out there because we heard from  you guys yesterday and it sounded like a lot of you guys weren't happy.  Just weren't happy with what's going on at home.  Whether you're a woman or a guy, you know, there was really no one to blame yesterday. 
[08:00]
 Fell into a lull in your relationships.  Mm-hmm.  Little icebreaker.  Yes, we're encouraging the ladies later on today.  Any time from now until midnight or a little after, we'll give you a little leeway.  You take care of your husband.  You want his back and then your official member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  It's easy.  And Rick is informing me we might have the first official member on the phone line here. 
[08:30]
 Oh, let's go.  I believe this guy is Fred.  Hi, NW.  I'll be Anthony.  Yeah.  You guys are gods.  Thank you so much for Hummer Tuesday.  Why? What happened?  My girlfriend was visiting her friends out in Wantoa and I turned her on to NW when you  guys started and she was just driving by and she heard Hummer Tuesday and she called me  on her cell phone.  She's like, is it busy?  And they go, no.  You got any customers?  They go, no.  She goes, I got a surprise for you.  So she stops by. 
[09:00]
 She's like, lock the doors.  I'm like, why?  Then she wanted to hum.  I'm not about to say no.  Fred, you're officially the first member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  How happy are you?  I got a grin on my face from ear to ear.  There you go.  It's a better world now.  Now, if I had a cigar, it'd be perfect.  Fred, congratulations.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You guys are gods.  Now, remember, when you call our show for now, just remind us that you're the first 
[09:30]
 official member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  All right.  You got it.  All right, brother.  Bye.  Man, the facts are spilling in like crazy here, too.  212-957-WNEW.  This one reads, hey, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club is the ultimate idea I've ever heard.  If all the wives out there would join the club, there would never be any divorce.  Women don't realize all guys want is a good wah-wah and a cheeseburger.  That is what I live for.  Paul from Brooklyn.  We're simple beings.  We are simple beings, men. 
[10:00]
 Yes.  And a Hummer is just, God, it's such a treat.  It makes me happy for days.  Yeah.  Not hours, days.  Opie and Anthony, my girlfriend just made me a member of your Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  All right, congrats.  Thank you, guys.  You rock.  It's Al from New Jersey checking in, another member.  It's like a Hummer telethon going on.  People checking in.  We're going to the tote board.  How many Hummers are we up to officially?  I think two.  I think only two.  That's okay.  We just started.  We've got to start somewhere. 
[10:30]
 It's somewhere with this freak show.  Now, this is the type of telethon I'd like to see on TV.  The Hummer telethon.  Yeah, instead of dragging out all the cripples and stuff, you can drag out all the loser guys that haven't had it in a while.  Look at this poor sap.  He hasn't had one in years.  Come on, call up.  Our phones have to keep ringing.  Yeah.  These men need Hummers.  He drove over to the telethon in his minivan.  Oh, with the baby stuff in the back.  All of a sudden, you turn into a pack mule for baby equipment. 
[11:00]
 All these guys I knew when I was growing up and my friends.  One guy I knew.  He had this GTO.  We used to go out and we were so proud of it and everything.  Now you see him.  He's in a minivan.  And everywhere he goes, he's got the playpen and this big Pampers sack.  And he's pulling things and kids are pulling on his leg.  And I'm just like, God, he was the coolest guy.  He was the guy you looked up to.  Oh, wow, look at this.  Well, maybe we could get a spark back into his life.  That's all we're trying to do.  That's all we're just trying to help. 
[11:30]
 Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Now, isn't this much more exciting than listening to DJs just sing tunes?  Of course.  Like they've been doing for the last 15 years here.  We are giving back to the community at this point, Anthony.  Trying to help Opie.  Yes.  And another guy checking in on the instant feedback.  Bill says, awesome.  I just called my wife and she's willing to make me an official member.  This is better than marriage counseling.  Keep up the good work.  Look at this.  We're saving marriages.  This rocks. 
[12:00]
 1027W, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with the Stone Temple Pilots.  That's Wicked Garden from the core CD and also Plush.  It's Opie and Anthony.  On TV, they're showing the footage of the Rockefeller Christmas tree.  I've now seen them cut down the tree for a hundred times.  That was the hundredth time they showed it on TV.  Happens every year.  And Anthony, did you know this is the first year in a very long time  that the tree actually isn't coming from New York State?  Opie, this tree coming from Ohio, 
[12:30]
 you know, it took this tree 60 years to get to the size it's at  and just a mere 90 seconds to be cut down by a chainsaw  as they loaded onto a military cargo plane,  which we talked to the pilot of that plane,  and yesterday, we were talking to the pilot of that plane  and yes, it can handle the weight.  I watched the news, I was drooling at the end of it.  I was just like...  What does that say for mankind?  The tree's been growing for 60, 70 years  and we cut it down at 90 seconds. 
[13:00]
 Yeah.  Right.  Just so a bunch of fat housewives  can come to Rockefeller Center and screw up our traffic.  I skate under the tree, for God's sake!  Let me have a good Christmas!  Trees sitting there for years.  Whistling  Little sapling.  Yeah.  Whistling  Growing up in the perfect spot.  You know how many trees don't ever make it? 
[13:30]
 The perfect spot to grow that big,  the sun is perfect, the weather's perfect.  Whistling  Whistling  Whistling  Starting to get a little bigger.  Oh, look, it survived its little sapling.  It survived its little sapling stage, Opie,  and it's growing into a beautiful Christmas tree.  Look, a little bunny lives under it.  It's a little bunny's home.  Whistling  Whistling  What year is it now?  1955! 
[14:00]
 Wow, it's been here a while, it's so big!  Gee, that thing could probably grow  and grow and grow for a thousand years.  Oh, look, it's 1998.  Whistling  Whistling  Here, this one looks good, Artie!  Here, it's off!  Whistling  There it goes.  That's it.  Lovely.  Man, we bastards.  They were talking to the people that work around Rockefell Center. 
[14:30]
 They say this time of year is an absolute living hell.  They can't even go to lunch.  They have to eat at like 10 in the morning  because lunchtime it's just everyone going down there  and they're like, check out the tree.  People work in this city.  A lot of people forget that.  And they say it's something like  almost 100,000 more cars,  additional cars in per day  during the Christmas season.  It's like 80,000 new cars coming in.  Most of them going to check out the tree. 
[15:00]
 The tree and shopping and taking pictures.  Look, I'm in front of Tiffany's for God's sake!  It's not my picture!  I'm trying to walk by here  and they're walking backwards on the sidewalk at you.  I'll get out of the way.  Hey, stockbroker Dave's on the line.  He is.  Actually, his new name is Vasectomy Dave  because he's hopefully going to get his ballies chopped  on our show in a couple weeks, I believe.  Vasectomy Dave, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How's everything?  Good.  Have a good one. 
[15:30]
 A guy comes up to me today and says he's got some inside info.  He says Bob Hope does not see Thanksgiving.  So I'm like, get out of here.  I said Joe DiMaggio is gone before him.  So we've got to wager $1,000.  Who dies first, Bob Hope or Joe DiMaggio?  Oh, man, I think Bob Hope's going to be around for a while.  I don't think Joe DiMaggio sees Christmas.  No, I don't think so either because they're starting  to say it in the paper.  No, he's feeling good lately.  His prognosis is great.  Usually when they say that, they're dead within 24 hours.  He will not see Christmas. 
[16:00]
 Dave, you're betting $1,000 on celebrities' death.  What, volume a little low today on the floor?  Very slow the last two days, Anthony.  Very slow the last two days.  When you're betting on celebrities' death.  Meanwhile, I get somebody on the floor  sends me 50 cases of mixed vegetables from my testicles.  Yeah, are you going to do that on our show or what?  November 20th.  You're definitely going to get your cake.  I'm taking one for the team, dude.  Awesome.  He's going to get a vasectomy live on our show.  10 days, dude.  10 days.  10 days and counting before you're on the show  live getting your thingy snipped. 
[16:30]
 So that's why I've got to get this Hummer Tuesday in.  Yeah, you better take care of it today.  I'm going to be on the shelf for a while.  All right, Dave.  All right, boys.  Be well.  I'll speak to you next week.  Take it easy.  Bye-bye.  The Rock of New York 1027W&W.  Two for Tuesday with Led Zeppelin,  The Cringe from Houses of the Holy  and Rock and Roll from Zozo.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We've got another NW World Premiere broadcast tonight.  The new release from U2,  the best of 1980 through 1990.  That's happening at 10 o'clock tonight. 
[17:00]
 Going to play and s-load of stuff from the disc  and talk to the band.  It's going to be very, very cool.  So keep listening to NW.  All right?  All right.  Well, we've got to explain our brand new concept.  We've got a ton of new listeners  checking us out for the first time  because they had to work until 5 o'clock.  Mm-hmm.  We have started the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, Anthony.  The Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  This stems from our conversations  we were having with you guys yesterday  where we came away from yesterday's show  thinking a lot of people aren't happy  with what's going on at home.  Yeah, we found out that people have been married 
[17:30]
 and have been in relationships for many years.  They fall into a rut  where sex goes to the side.  You just don't get it anymore.  And it's hard to break the ice again.  You can't walk up to your significant other  and, you know,  hey, baby, how about a ar-ar-ar-ar?  Yeah.  You know, because you're embarrassed.  You don't want to, you know,  get away from me, you pervert.  Or I'm not in the mood or something.  Speaking for most guys,  I must say I enjoy a good ar-ar-ar-ar 
[18:00]
 every once in a while.  Well, who doesn't?  For God's sake.  And all we're saying is  if we bring this up on the air  and leave it out there in the open,  you're going to be home later.  Your wife or girlfriend is going to be there.  Or your boyfriend.  I don't care who you go out with.  This could work many different ways, I guess.  Who cares?  But all of a sudden you're going to kind of start laughing  and going, oh,  you hear what those wacky bastards did today on N.E.W.?  Yeah.  Next thing you know,  I think your chances of getting something  are greatly increased, Anthony. 
[18:30]
 Everyone will be a lot happier, we think.  That's why we are just saying that on every Tuesday,  from today on, every Tuesday,  when the guy gets home,  you're together,  give the poor guy a little something.  A little ar-ar-ar.  Take his wah-wah and give him a wah-wah-wah.  Because I'm sure there will be some reciprocal acts  that go on after that.  Well, we are getting there.  But it's all up to the...  It's pretty much we know how this works. 
[19:00]
 It's usually the lady's choice.  It really is.  You ladies have complete control in most cases.  It's always all these time constraints  and this and that and I'm not...  Let's just set it aside.  Here it is.  Here's your opportunity,  your window of opportunity we're giving you.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  That's it.  You have a bowling league.  You go play darts every Thursday.  Well, Tuesday is the Tuesday Night Armor Club.  You want to be a member,  you just take care of the deep.  Now, Michelle from New York brings up a great point here. 
[19:30]
 Dear Opie and Anthony,  I would like to join the Hummer Club,  but I have one question.  What about our needs?  What do we get?  Please answer on the air.  Well, we're hoping the guys will reciprocate  and do whatever makes you happy.  Yes.  This gets the ball rolling.  This gets the ball rolling.  We have to start somewhere.  Right.  And we could go the other way and say,  Okay, now guys,  go home and satisfy your woman in that fashion.  Uh-huh.  But that doesn't guarantee  that the guy's going to get his uh-uh-uh. 
[20:00]
 Right.  And we all love the uh-uh-uh.  I love that.  So that's why we're starting here.  Starting with ladies, please,  on Tuesday,  give your guys the uh-uh-uh.  And we just did the math really quickly here.  Members are joining our club every five minutes.  Oh, this is great.  Since, since uh, 350 today,  the membership is going up every five minutes.  Isn't that great?  So here's one from Johnny B.  Johnny B. writes,  Boys, I was just meeting an official member 
[20:30]
 while driving home with my girlfriend.  Thank God for tinted windows.  And this guy, Mike,  this is hysterical because earlier  we called some guy's wife to help him out  and talk her into doing it tonight  and she agreed.  Mike writes,  Please, for the love of God,  call my wife.  Call her now at work.  Here's her number.  Call, please call.  Her name is Jody.  Please, I beg you.  See, now there's a guy  who would just be so happy  if he got home  and she was waiting there with open arms 
[21:00]
 and other things.  Well, it doesn't have to,  we don't want to put the pressure on.  It doesn't have to happen  as soon as the guy gets home.  Just sometime tonight.  Maybe when he least expects it,  it actually would be even more fun.  But it just gives you the opportunity  to discuss it.  And you guys got complete freedom.  You don't feel like doing it.  That's fine.  But our membership will grow.  And we are looking for the official oath.  Yeah.  Anthony and I being the grand poobas  of this lovely club.  Do we get some wacky hats 
[21:30]
 like the hat on the Flintstones?  Yeah, really.  Like the Lodge hat.  The water buffalo.  The water buffalo.  Yeah.  I don't know,  whether you'll like wear a big penis hat.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And do we have like a special handshake maybe?  Because when we're out and about,  we can see if you're an official member  or not just by the handshake.  Woo-woo!  Where are those?  Where's that lawyer thing?  The lawyer's not in effect.  Yeah.  Additional comments. 
[22:00]
 Here's the oath of membership  for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Well, as according to them,  we haven't made these official yet.  Yeah.  I state your name.  Hereby swear to uphold, preserve,  and protect the constitution  of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  This oath will entail faithful adherence  to the following.  Hummers every Tuesday without fail.  This is not a one-night splurge or splooge.  Members will reciprocate.  This is not one-sided.  Members may not drive minivans unless, of course,  a Hummer is given in a minivan, 
[22:30]
 in which case the members may continue  to use the vehicle.  What?  That sounds great to anyone driving a minivan.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Well, this lady has sent in some rules.  This is really good.  And she's already emailing it to everyone.  It's becoming junk mail on the Internet,  which is good.  We need the help here.  Yeah.  So we can grow the show.  Etiquette, rules for men.  Number one, first and foremost, 
[23:00]
 we are not obligated to do it.  Number two, so if you get one,  be grateful.  Number three, I don't care what they did  in the poor video you saw.  It's not standard practice to want,  want on my want, want.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  Number four, no,  I don't have to...  Number five, my ears are not handles.  Number six, do not push on the top of my head. 
[23:30]
 I can't even read that one on the air.  Sorry.  Oh, come on.  I can't.  I got to see it.  Number seven,  this is want, want etiquette,  rules for men.  I don't care how relaxed you get.  It is never okay to fart.  Oh, please.  Is that even necessary to say?  Well, you said you wanted to hear it.  Having my period does not mean that it's want,  want weak.  Get it through your head.  I'm bloated and I feel like S.  So no, I don't feel particularly obligated to want,  want just because you won't have sex right now. 
[24:00]
 Oh, this is starting to sound like  why you don't get a...  I know.  I need a thing.  Number nine,  blue balls might have worked on high school girls.  If you're that desperate,  go want, want yourself and leave me alone  with my mind off.  Oh, I can't read that one.  All right.  Number 11,  leaving me in bed while you go play video games  immediately afterwards is highly inadvisable  if you would like my behavior to be repeated in the future.  Yeah, you got to... 
[24:30]
 It's like a golf swing.  You need a good follow through, guys.  Oh, number 12,  this is want, want etiquette,  rules for men.  If you like how we do it,  it's probably best not to speculate  about the origins of our talent.  Just enjoy the moment  and be happy that we're good at it.  I can't read that one.  No, I will not do it while you watch TV.  Oh, bogus.  That's kind of lame anyway.  You should be watching TV. 
[25:00]
 Number 15, interesting.  When you hear your friends complain  about how they don't get want,  often enough, keep your mouth shut.  It is inappropriate to either sympathize or brag.  Okay, very good.  The TV thing is good though  because I know there have been times  you're in the throes of it  and I've glanced at the TV  and it can ruin the moment when you see,  you know,  this is young Maria.  Her village is starving.  You're like, oh.  All of a sudden,  all of a sudden you're like, 
[25:30]
 all of a sudden you're like,  out of steam.  All right.  Another fact coming in here really fast.  Hey guys,  me and my girl are just finished joining your club.  We work together  and we were just in the boss's office.  The mice will play while the cats away.  Wow.  Oh, by the way,  does it matter if we're both girls?  Debbie and Donna have joined the club. 
[26:00]
 Welcome girls.  Official members of the A.W.  Rock on a waffer a waffer.  Okay, good.  I didn't even know what to say about that.  So I think we're on our way.  All right.  I believe we need some ladies to call  to take the official oath  for the Tuesday night Hummer Club.  Anthony.  Yes.  Dice.  Andrew Dice Clay will be delivering the oath.  The oath.  1027 W.N.A.W.  The Rock of New York 2 for Tuesday.  David Bowie, Rebel Rebel.  Did you see the version 
[26:30]
 that Iggy Pop and Lenny Kravitz did  on the VH1 Fashion Awards?  Pretty good.  Unfreaking believable.  The show was actually a complete bore  because they decided this year  not to allow nipples to show through the clothing  like they've done in past years  during the Fashion Awards.  But Iggy Pop and Lenny Kravitz  came on stage and did that song.  Unbelievable.  They should release that thing.  It was great.  Good chap.  It truly was.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We are discussing our new concept today  on the show,  the Tuesday night Hummer Club.  Members are being... 
[27:00]
 Inducted.  Inducted pretty much every five minutes now at this point.  Yeah, we realized yesterday  a lot of people are miserable in their relationships  and married and kids  and for some reason, six gets put on the back burner.  We're just trying to bring it to the forefront again.  Every Tuesday, how about a Hummer?  Yeah, how about it?  It's easy.  And guys, we're encouraging you to reciprocate  in whatever way the lady likes.  But we have to get the thing rolling.  Whatever she's into, yes.  So we're just saying on Tuesday, 
[27:30]
 anytime Tuesday,  how about the lady gives the guy a...  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, and I know there's a lot of guys  that are on their way home now going,  Oh my God, my girl doesn't even listen to any W.  Well, you know what you've got to do.  Make sure she's listening at the worst next Tuesday  and we'll break the ice to her.  And then you can go,  Hey, do you know,  we're listening to the radio today, boy.  You hear what those idiots are doing?  Yeah, that whole Hummer thing.  It's pretty stupid, right?  Yeah, just play it down. 
[28:00]
 Yeah.  Next thing you know, it's going to happen.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, that's stupid.  Yeah, well, I guess it's time to give the official oath  to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah.  And we honestly don't want to do this.  Usually we despise...  Then shut your mouth and let me do this.  ...despise when the Dice Man is on our show,  but shut your mouth and let me do this.  We figured here'd be...  Because you finally,  you've finally done something on the radio show  that's kind of funny and it's kind of good  and it's kind of helpful to the guys out there 
[28:30]
 that might not be, you know, sexually satisfied.  Well, we were sick of waiting for you  to come up with something funny for our show.  I don't get paid to come up with funny stuff for your show.  Well, why do you sit in the lobby, you know,  patiently waiting for us to call you to come into our show?  I'm making deals.  I got people.  That's nighty-heen or there.  I'm listening.  I kind of appreciate what you do, A-holes,  is doing for the guys out there  because it's hard to just say,  Hey, honey, how about you throw me one? 
[29:00]
 Because you get,  Oh, my jaw hurts.  Oh, you hurt me today.  Hey, come here, honey.  Piggy!  You know, it's hard.  A guy can't ask for this.  It's just got to happen.  So I'd be willing to come in here  and give the girls the Oat of Orphus  or Oat of Orifice as it were.  Can you describe a way the ladies could approach their men tonight?  With your mouth open! 
[29:30]
 What are you talking about?  Approach!  Wiggy-wiggy!  How else you want them to approach?  From the rear?  What's wrong with you?  Approach from the front with your mouth open, honey!  I was thinking more like,  you know, the cute cuddly...  Look, he's talking out his ears.  He's talking out his ears again.  He's talking out his ears.  All right, shut up!  Turn my mic on! 
[30:00]
 You snap-ass!  No, I'm not turning the mic on.  Look how silly you look over there without a microphone.  Me without a microphone, I'm better than you two asses.  Look how silly you look.  Look at you.  Screw yourself!  Yeah, look, you need me to turn on your microphone, don't you?  Let me talk to the broads!  Yeah, look at you.  You're pathetic when the mic's not on.  Snap-ass!  Yeah, don't get too going.  Look at you, you look pathetic.  If I gotta come over to that side of the board,  I'm gonna get an ass whip.  And why aren't you actually smoking the cigarettes anymore? 
[30:30]
 Why do you just have it in your hand?  Because I got a love for cigarettes,  I just don't got a love for canes.  Oh, so this is your way of looking cool or something?  At least I got a way of looking cool, huh?  You snap-ass.  Turn my mic up!  Turn it up!  All right, there it is.  Today you try to silence one of the comic geniuses of our time,  Andrew Dice Clay!  Now put the broads on,  I wanna induct them into the good hum-a-thingy. 
[31:00]
 All right, here's the deal,  we got like five ladies on hold and you can talk to them, okay, Dice?  Okay, put the hoes on!  All right, ladies, you guys ready to take the oath?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, let's go.  And every single one of you are gonna become a member tonight?  Absolutely.  Okay.  All right, here's Andrew Dice Clay, everyone.  Hey, ladies, how you doing, honies?  Hey, Andrew!  Hey, yous all hot, huh?  How's it going?  Yous all ready to throw your husbands a good one?  Uh-huh.  For your boys or whatever, huh? 
[31:30]
 Hey, forget about it.  All right, repeat after me, huh?  I state your name.  I state your name.  Yeah, there's a bunch of smart-asses over here.  Do solemnly swear.  Do solemnly swear.  That on each Tuesday evening.  That on each Tuesday evening.  I will with all my ability faithfully execute.  I will with all my ability.  Can you get it together, sweethearts?  This ain't a quilting beer, right? 
[32:00]
 Faithfully execute upon my significant other.  Faithfully execute upon my significant other.  The act of.  The act of.  The act of.  Honing the knob.  Honing the knob.  Honing the knob.  Buffing the captain's helmet.  Buffing the captain's helmet.  Licking the purple blow pop.  Licking the purple blow pop.  Oh!  Oh!  Come on, girls, get it together, huh?  We're licking the purple blow pop.

[33:00]
 What?  Tuesday evening packer club, whatever.  Hey, good idea, fellas.  I like this one.  Bring on the chicks.  First good idea you had in five months.  Yeah, but see, my husband won't need a towel.  All right, ladies.  Go on and conquer, OK?  All right, thanks.  All right, bye.  And there they go.  Where did you get these girls, huh?  Hey, easy, they're our listeners.  I don't care.  They don't even know how to talk right. 
[33:30]
 I'm trying to tell them to get out of office  and they can't even talk.  Maybe it'd be better with something in their mouths.  All right, do you want to do Brady Bunch trivia still, Anthony?  We said we were going to do it yesterday.  Yeah, we got some good prizes for you.  Yeah, what do we got?  Yeah, what do we got?  I think we have like the Larismith Live CD and stuff.  And we'll throw in like a little CD package.  Yeah, we'll throw something together.  Throw something together.  Basically, Anthony is the king of trivia.  Well, I was saying yesterday how I hate shows like ER and stuff 
[34:00]
 because they're depressing and I just instantly  punch out over to Nickelodeon.  And for years I've done that and I watched.  I watched pretty stupid shows.  And I know everything.  I suck all the stuff up.  You know pretty much everything about the Brady Bunch?  Yeah, the Brady Bunch is one of the shows  that's just like useless information  that's stuck in my head.  I also know you're the king of Star Trek trivia too,  the originals.  Yeah, none of that next generation crap.  Just the original Star Trek runs.  All right, basically what we're going to do,  call up right now at 212-757-1027 
[34:30]
 if you've got a Brady Bunch trivia question.  Yeah.  We're going to put everyone on live  so there's no games being played here.  And the first person to stump Anthony  will win this lovely CD prize package, okay?  Could be the first person.  Could be the first person and then you look like a big egghole.  Well, sometimes they come up with some ridiculous questions too.  Yeah.  What type tires were on the Brady car?  Don't even hit me with those.  Yeah, don't go there.  Keep it interesting, okay?  All right.  All right, we'll do that next.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Lenny Kravitz. 
[35:00]
 The Rock of New York, Lenny Kravitz  always on the run from Mama Said  and his latest Fly Away before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  We'll be talking about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  a little more because there's a bunch of people  that have been inducted as our show continues to roll along here.  But right now we want to play Brady Bunch trivia.  All right.  Because Anthony amazes a lot of people around here  with his memory of the Brady Bunch.  I know.  And I just want to see how far he can go 
[35:30]
 before someone stumps you with a question.  Ridiculous knowledge I have.  Yes.  And we do have a prize package, right, Rick?  What do we got?  Some CDs and a T-shirt.  Okay, that's good enough.  Well, let's put something really cool together for you guys.  So the first person to stump Anthony  will win the prize package.  All right, let's go to the phones.  If you've got some trivia, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Hi, who's this?  This is Brian.  All right, Brian, what's your Brady Bunch trivia question  for Anthony?  What junior high school did they go to?  Fillmore Junior High. 
[36:00]
 F-F-F-I-L-L-L-L-O-O-O-O-R-E.  Fillmore Junior High.  Hi, who's this?  Is this freaking OP and Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, I love you guys.  Thanks, man.  All right, what street do they live on?  The Brady's.  Come on, dude.  Clinton, Clinton.  Holy crap.  Yeah, I remember it was like Bill Clinton.  Sure, Bill Clinton.  Very crap.  Clinton Street.  I-A-W.  Yeah, hi.  Hi, what's your trivia question?  What was the name of the guy that Marcia had a date with 
[36:30]
 when she broke her nose?  Big man or a big man?  I don't even know his name.  Oh, yeah, Doug Simpson.  Ah!  Big man on campus.  You got it.  Thanks for asking that.  Wow, you're up to three already.  Three?  Yeah, that's not bad.  Hi, N-A-W.  N-A-W.  Hi, there.  Hi.  What's your trivia question?  The question is this.  On the driving test between Greg and Marcia,  how did it end and what was the final result?  That's easy.  Yeah, they did the little obstacle course  with the cones in the parking lot 
[37:00]
 and the first one to break the egg off the cone lost.  Yeah, but let's say they both made it to the end.  What was the final test?  If they both made it to the end?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Which they both did.  They both made it to the end of the test  without breaking the egg.  They did it again and then the egg broke.  That's not what happened.  The egg broke.  Yeah, that's not what happened.  The egg broke because Greg choked.  Now they had to come closest to the cone 
[37:30]
 without knocking the cone over.  So they said the egg on the cone of stopping.  What did I just say?  No, that's not what you said.  Dave said the first one to break the egg  and the egg was on top of the cone.  The egg was on the cone.  All right.  Knock.  Jesus.  Greg choked, hit the gas.  Oh, please.  We're going to give that one to you after four.  Hi, N-A-W.  Hi, how are you doing?  All right, what's your name?  My name is Peter.  All right, Peter.  Peter Brady.  This is kind of an oddball trivia question  because it's not like who did what when. 
[38:00]
 But Anthony, are you ready for this?  All right.  Did we as viewers ever get to see  what the original Mrs. Brady looked like,  the boy's mother?  Yeah, in the first episode,  it was a picture though.  You are right.  Yeah.  Anthony's up to five.  I think she was even hotter than Carol.  She was a smoker.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Hi, N-A-W.  Yeah, hey, there was an episode  where Jan made up a fake boyfriend.  What was his name?  Oh, that would be George Glass. 
[38:30]
 Very good.  That's good.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  I would have got that one.  Hi, N-A-W.  Hi, it's me still.  Hi, me still.  What's your trivia question?  We've got you live in the air.  Okay, my question is,  when the kids got really mad at Alice  and she sort of was forced to leave the Brady household  and she didn't do anything wrong,  she didn't really mean to do anything,  there was a maid who came in  who substituted for Alice. 
[39:00]
 What was the maid's name?  That is a toughie.  Let's see.  I know way too much about the Brady's too.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That's a good one.  She might win the prize pack, Adope.  Let's see, the maid that took over for Alice.  On the spot.  She was mean.  Yeah, she was.  She got him up in the morning to do calisthenics and stuff.  No, that was Alice's cousin.  Oh, the other one?  She was just kind of a load. 
[39:30]
 She really didn't do much.  That's right.  I can't remember her name though.  You win.  I do.  Her name was Kay.  Kay.  Remember at the end she said,  that was Alice.  I'm Kay.  Yeah, bitch.  All right.  All right, well, you win.  That's good.  Anthony made it to seven.  What's your name?  My name is Thea.  Hi, are you going to be a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club tonight?  Oh, sure.  She doesn't even know what it is.  Keep listening.  We'll explain it one more time. 
[40:00]
 All right.  All right, thanks for listening.  All right, thank you.  Hold on the line.  Oh, that wasn't bad though, Anne.  You made it to seven.  Yeah, but I kind of feel like Cindy when she choked on that show, the kids' show.  That was a tough one though.  We could give it another round in a little while.  All right, we still have Thea on the line because Rick just told us that she has a very  unusual last name.  Well, she does.  She was the one that just won the Brady Bunch trivia thing we just did.  Yeah.  Thea.  Yes.  All right, what's your last name?  My last name is Orofice. 
[40:30]
 What is it?  Orofice.  Orofice.  Orofice.  How do you spell it?  O-R-E.  F as in Frank.  I-C-E.  That's Orofice.  Your last name is Orofice.  Okay.  Thea Orofice.  You guys are cracking me up.  Come on.  What do you call it?  I can't.  What?  What do you call your last name?  We say it in, we say Orofice.  Yeah, I don't care what language you say it in. 
[41:00]
 It is Orofice.  Yeah, I know.  Like they ever pronounced it like that during attendance in school.  No, actually some people did.  The Orofice?  Is the Orofice here?  Oh my gosh.  We had to go back to you real fast.  You've taken enough abuse I'm sure over the years.  I owe my whole life.  We'll let you go.  Well, she stumped me.  Obviously she was in watching the Brady Bunch because she couldn't go out of the house with  the name like that. 
[41:30]
 Bye.  Bye.  That's too much.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York 2 for Tuesday, Blue Oyster Cult, Godzilla.  Every time I hear that song I think of the Laser Light Show in Huntington when I was  growing up.  Oh yeah.  The Laser Light Show, they played Bye Bye Love by the Cars, Crazy On You by Heart,  Cashmere by Zeppelin, the Laser Show.  You have to sneak your booze and drugs in.  Sit there with your friends.  Yeah, this is cool. 
[42:00]
 Whoa, they're making a horse run.  Wow.  Whoa, looks like a Spirograph.  Great.  Yeah, wonderful.  Do you think we could like drink to this pint of Jack and be sober before our parents pick  us up?  Yeah, you get the Visine.  I think we can pull it off.  Let's go for it.  Yeah, sure.  I mean, parents are going to pick you up.  What do you say?  Oh, okay, here they come in.  Be cool. 
[42:30]
 Be cool.  Yeah, that's going to take away from all the pot and booze and everything else.  Just going, be cool.  Oh yeah, I was just puking a minute ago and staggering.  I couldn't even stand up.  I can't talk.  But thank God you said, be cool.  But here comes your dad.  Hi, N.A.W.  Hello.  Got you live in the air.  So what happened?  Well, I walked in the door.  Be careful, okay? 
[43:00]
 Okay, I walked in the door.  My wife has been sick for the last four days.  She's been, you know, I mean, stuffy nose, full of snot, etc., etc.  Anyways, after she took it all.  Okay.  We get the message.  Well, you are a proud member now.  Yeah, so I want to be a proud member.  Well, you are.  Cheese the Night Hummer Club.  Yes, okay. 
[43:30]
 Thanks for being.  Okay, thank you.  Cute story.  Cute story.  You know, the words that are going to get you in trouble, just go, you know, she...  We all know what you're talking about.  We can figure it out.  We don't have to completely spell it out for everyone.  Just give us the setup.  It's working very well.  Yes, it is.  The phones are going nuts. 
[44:00]
 Smiles all around the city.  All right.  The Rock of New York.  You have one message.  Just letting you know that you will become a member tonight yourself, so don't worry.  You know, just in case you're wondering if you're going to become a member of the club.  You will definitely earn your wings tonight.  Bye.  Mom, is that you?  Same past.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday with Pink Floyd. 
[44:30]
 Facts are spilling out like crazy.  You know, I'm not going to be able to get a good night's sleep tonight.  Facts are spilling out like crazy.  This is from Richie in Hoboken.  I've been inducted.  My girl called me while the Dice Man was inducting the inductees.  She pledged along with the other girls to me over the phone.  Tuesday night, here I come.  Very good.  Have a happy customer.  Congratulations to Richie.  All right.  Man, hey, we're doing something cool with Bruce Springsteen. 
[45:00]
 Every time we play Bruce Springsteen on the radio, we're giving away tracks, Bruce's new box set,  to the 20th caller at 212-757-1027.  We're doing that now through Friday at 6 p.m.  All right.  And if you don't want to wait around to win it, it is on sale now at all record stores, the box set.  We got our copy yesterday and I tracked through and it was quite enjoyable to say the least.  All right.  Very happy for you.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday with Nirvana. 
[45:30]
 Off Nevermind Lithium and smells like Teen Spirit before that.  So, Anthony, closing up shop for another day.  Actually, we got to do one more thing before we get out of here.  Yes.  Email coming in like crazy about the Tuesday night Hummer Club.  Raymond writes, I'm an official member as of 5 15 p.m. tonight.  All right.  Where do I send my dues?  It goes on to say, it was like a lion attacking a wounded deer on the Animal Kingdom show. 
[46:00]
 All right.  Congratulations, Ray.  But I think we need to try to take care of someone before we leave here, Anthony.  This is getting like a public service show, isn't it?  Yes, it is.  We're like a Hummer welfare.  Poor guys that aren't getting the Hummers are coming to us and saying, please help me.  Yes.  You know, so we start this Tuesday Hummer Club and people are coming out of the woodwork.  And we're doing this every Tuesday. 
[46:30]
 This isn't a one shot deal.  We can't ask for miracles here.  Guys, please.  But if you become a member, please get a hold of us tomorrow, whether through the fax line or the email overnight or whatever.  We've got to come up with a patch or a lapel pin or something so you can walk down the street and proudly display the fact that you have been inducted.  And someone please design the Grand Poo Bar hats for Anthony and I.  We want to fax in some designs.  Yes, you can fax in some designs. 
[47:00]
 We know you have some artists.  They can probably come up with some designs.  Yeah, we'll get them made up and next time we do a public appearance, we'll wear a Grand Poo Bar hats.  Or how about like your car?  You know how fighter planes used to draw like the old Japanese planes when you used to shoot them down?  You could put like a splooge stain on your door or your car for each one you get.  But no one will know the difference.  Driving in New York, you get that crap on your car anyway.  All right, Opie and Anthony, please help.  I would love to join your Tuesday night Hummer Club, but my wife Sue doesn't listen to your show. 
[47:30]
 Can you call her at home and tell her of the wonderful program you're trying to start?  Here's her number.  If you could pull this off, I will become a fan forever.  Thanks, John.  How could we deny this guy?  That's worth it.  I'm calling up Sue for John here.  I guess we'll have to talk her through it.  We have to.  Hello?  Hi, is Sue there?  Hold on one second. 
[48:00]
 John, we'll take care of you.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Hello?  Hi Sue.  It's Opie and Anthony from WNEWD Radio.  How are you?  We got you live in the air.  Is that okay?  Yeah, I guess.  Well, your husband John asked us to give you a little ring.  Oh, okay.  We really don't know how to tell you this, but we'll try tactfully, okay?  Okay.  Well, we've come up with a little concept, little idea on Tuesdays. 
[48:30]
 I think it's something that'll make a lot of people happy.  That's a good thing, right?  Right.  I think the stress of a hard day's work kind of builds up.  How long have you guys been married?  Seven years.  Yeah, seven years.  You start getting into a couple of ruts in life, right?  Right.  And then things get put on backburners for other things, right? 
[49:00]
 Exactly.  And maybe, let's just say, some intimacy suffers.  You know, you're not maybe as intimate as you used to be.  Right.  Well, we've come up with a concept here.  It's called the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  The Tuesday Night Hummer Club, yes.  And we're encouraging the ladies to, you know, take the guys and, you know, wha wha.  On Tuesday nights.  And if you would do this deed for him, he would be an official member of our lovely little club. 
[49:30]
 It's hard for a guy to just come out and ask for this.  And we understand that.  So we're breaking the ice here.  And he would really enjoy, you know, like the old days, one of those good old fashioned aw aw.  You know?  So what do you say, Sue?  What do you say?  Look at the guy.  You can probably, look at him.  Look at him.  Look how pathetic he looks over there.  He's probably staring at you. 
[50:00]
 He looks like a deer with the, you know, he's caught in headlights over there.  Some simple pledges in life that don't even cost anything.  And that's one of them.  And he would really, really enjoy that.  Oh, okay.  So we figured we would ask you for him.  Will you give him a hummer tonight?  Um, I guess.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  That's what we want to hear.  That's great.  Bless your heart.  I know John would appreciate it and I guarantee he's going to be a real good guy for the next few days at the worst. 
[50:30]
 Oh, okay.  And if you promise to give him a hummer, we will give you a prize.  Oh, okay.  So you will give it to him?  Yeah.  You will?  Of course.  Look at that.  Can we talk to John really fast?  Sure.  And hold on because we're going to give you a prize too.  Oh, okay. 
[51:00]
 John?  Yeah?  You're in.  All right.  I didn't think you guys were going to call because you were just getting ready to go down and lay down and get some sleep because she works tonight.  Well, now she's got to go down somewhere else.  All right, tell us how it is tomorrow.  That I will.  We're all patiently waiting.  Okay, I'll talk to you again.  All right, man.  Okay, bye.  Well, that was easy.  Oh, damn it if we have to do it one at a time like that.  If we have to do it one at a time for you guys, we will. 
[51:30]
 You just got to promise that you have to listen to us forever if we do this favor for you.  You know, another station out there might get you concert tickets.  They might play your song request.  Hey, that's kind of cool.  You get a little dedication to your girlfriend.  How cute.  That's really kind of neat.  Maybe even the chance to win ten thousand dollars at some big giveaway.  Which by the way, no one wins.  Of course not.  Okay. 
[52:00]
 Who's getting your hummers?  See, Opium Anthony Show getting your hummers.  This is Pimp Radio.  Pimp Radio!  I am Stix Franklin at Pimp Radio.  All right.  Look at the time.

 Yes.  Like John just did.  He called up.  We phoned his wife.  He's in Hummer heaven.  There you go.  Right about now, something very good is happening at John's house.  Great.  Do we have his number?  Where is the number?  That would be funny as hell.  Because I know they're probably in the middle of it right now.  Hello?  All right, we got to go.  All right.

 John can't come to the play or not?  All right.  Thanks for listening.  We appreciate it.  Good luck with joining the club tonight. </pre>
