<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of their ratings, celebrating success in Cleveland and Sacramento while lamenting poor performance in Boston.  This transitioned into a detailed, graphic recounting of a particularly explicit *South Park* episode featuring Butters' father's sexual exploits. The hosts then engaged with listener calls, many attempting to establish themselves as recurring characters with catchphrases. One caller sought help escaping a website (foundrymusic.com), while another criticized the show's humor targeting the homeless and other groups.  Numerous angry listener calls followed, targeting sports figures and criticizing the show's perceived ethnic humor.  Upcoming guests Mark Burnett (*Survivor*) and the Regan brothers were announced. The hosts also detailed plans for a bizarre Xbox competition involving contestants filling condoms with water.  Throughout this segment, offensive language, including racial slurs and descriptions of sexually explicit content, was prevalent.

The show continued with a comedic running gag focused on the hosts' intern, John's, repeated failures to correctly procure their coffee orders.  Their meticulous preferences were highlighted, contrasting sharply with John’s incompetence.  Anthony's bad mood, fueled by an incorrect sushi order, exacerbated the situation.  A timed coffee-fetching mission for John further fueled the comedic tension, culminating in John delivering the wrong size latte, prompting Anthony to throw his coffee. Opie’s “prick” persona was explicitly acknowledged as a character. A lengthy, absurd discussion on proper farting techniques to avoid contaminating the studio ensued.  An anecdote about Anthony being hit after a joke about a woman's breasts was shared.  Listener calls followed, including one recounting a female guidance counselor’s alleged sexual assault of a male student. A satellite phone interview with Mark Burnett discussed *Survivor*.  The coffee debacle continued, along with jokes about inappropriate behavior (including incestuous implications), and further planning for the Xbox competition with the Regan brothers.  Earl, a staff member recovering from bleeding ulcers, also appeared.

The broadcast then focused on the planning and testing of the aforementioned condom-based Xbox contest.  The hosts and producer Rick debated its feasibility, with caller Jeremy highlighting the difficulty.  Tests using water revealed condoms' limited expansion capabilities, leading to discussions of modifications suggested by listeners (including a "Texas catheter") and a FreeCondoms.com representative. Repeated condom-bursting attempts punctuated the segment.  Numerous calls to the "FU line" were played.  The upcoming appearance of Brian Regan and his brother was announced.  Further calls offered contest strategy suggestions (kiddie pools, strippers, trash bags).  News items discussed included Osama bin Laden’s supposed surrender (linked to the show's unfunniness), Winona Ryder's shoplifting arrest, and the Ramones and Talking Heads' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.  The segment concluded with contest planning, securing kiddie pools and finalizing contestant selection.

A "What did we learn today?" listener call-in segment followed.  Listeners offered crude and humorous observations about the show and the hosts, ranging from comments on Anthony's farting and Opie's grandmother's age to bizarre hypothetical scenarios (e.g., ten men urinating in condoms in a kiddie pool surrounded by strippers).  Jokes about bodily functions and sexual acts were common.  A listener won an Aerosmith prize pack.  The hosts promoted the upcoming "junk in a bag" contest and the Regan brothers' appearance, hinting at further chaos.  The show ended with self-deprecating humor, describing the broadcast as a "smorgasbord of idiocy".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Everyone else is. I'm a news station guy.  I listen to the news.  Shut up!  I would listen to this show if I wasn't on it.  The news stations are going to give us both aneurysms.  Yeah.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else including...  Yes?  Cleveland, Ohio!  Hey, Cleveland!  You bastards!  We love you. 
[00:00:30]  We love you, but we hate you.  You're going to make us come to your fine city soon.  You crazy sons of bitches.  Looks like they like us in Cleveland, Anthony.  I know.  Which means we're going to have to go up there and do a full-blown road show.  I don't want to go to Cleveland.  Oh, sure we do.  Cleveland rocks, as they say.  All kidding aside, Cleveland does rock, and it's a great party city, man.  Yeah.  We made the trip from Buffalo a few times when I was living up there.  You did?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fun city.  It is a fun city.  So, Cleveland, thank you.  We got a little ratings trend today.  Yeah.  Seems like Cleveland isn't listening to news stations like Anthony does.  No.  Cleveland doesn't care about the news.  We figured that out.  Thank God for that.  So, I guess Jay Moore and everyone else is right.  There's a buzz in Cleveland.  Yeah.  As far as our syndicated radio show goes.  Sacramento, we saw some positive things.  Yes.  There were some positive things. 
[00:01:30]  We're still at the bottom of the heap, but we're crawling our way out slowly but surely.  Right.  And Boston, well, it seems like you guys still like fake radio over us.  So, yeah, there's something going on there.  I don't know what to tell you.  Enjoy it.  They enjoy the fake radio instead of the real radio.  Enjoy it.  Have fun with it.  Embrace it.  But hopefully we can change their minds eventually up there in Boston.  That's good.  You know, we love you, but, man, trends aren't showing that yet.  What's going on up there? 
[00:02:00]  But Cleveland, hello.  You know what?  Maybe this will help.  Opie's going to have a fake wedding.  I'm going to be his best man, and you're going to leave the altar.  No.  It might help up there in Boston, Opie.  No.  They seem to enjoy that type of radio.  No, no, no, no, no.  Boston seems to like that stuff.  You want us to pick, maybe me and you could pick a new addition to the show  by flying a seat number to a stadium in the winter again?  No?  Let me put it this way.  I'd rather go to the White Swallow Spa. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, jeez.  A lot of people are writing it going,  I think I saw Norton in the White Swallow Spa on the Butter Show last night on South Park.  That's me.  That was a twisted show last night.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  That was a twisted episode of South Park last night.  I don't know if I liked it or not.  Stinky loved it.  I've seen funnier episodes, but that was, it was so sick. 
[00:03:00]  Butter's, Butter's father, turns out, is going to gay bars and gay massage places and gay movies  and having gay sex and they're like the all-American type family, of course.  He loves the White Swallow Spa.  Yeah.  The mom finds out and freaks out and decides she's got to kill Butters to keep him pure  and clean away from the father and everything.  So she takes him down to a lake and drives the car, pushes the car down a boat ramp with 
[00:03:30]  just him in it.  And he's like, ah, you know, at that point I had to turn to Sandy and go chill out, it's  just a cartoon.  I know, because it was just like that woman killed her kid.  Susan Smith.  Yeah.  Sandy started like having teary eyeballs.  I'm like, relax, it's a cartoon, man.  You can get away with more cartoons.  I didn't know how to do that.  It was pretty twisted, though.  Yeah.  Some Puerto Rican guy.  That's who it was. 
[00:04:00]  I shrugged at that point, too, and said, what?  What?  It's funny.  And, of course, they had O.J. on there.  They had Gary Condit.  They made Gary Condit.  The cartoon Gary Condit was real creepy.  Really, really creepy.  More creepy than he really looks.  They had a cover-up that they had killed Butters.  So they said some Puerto Rican guy did it.  And then they were getting support from the Ramseys, who killed John Bonet, saying that  some Puerto Rican guy killed her.  Literally. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, stop it.  Let's just stop at the alleged thing.  The Ramseys killed their daughter.  Please, enough.  And O.J. was part of the gang, and so was Gary Condit.  Very funny.  Yeah.  It was a sick episode, though.  It wasn't as funny as others have been, but it was twice as twisted.  The two scenes that just made my tongue hit the floor, though, was when Butters goes to  the White Swallow Spa, and he opens that one door, and they had B-F-ing. 
[00:05:00]  Can we say B-F-ing?  A-F-ing.  A-F-ing.  Yeah.  On South Park last night.  It was two body parts, but you could tell what the hell they were.  It was men's hips and buttocks, and you saw the man's hips moving.  The motion.  Yeah.  The motion.  It was just, I mean, if they had theoretically zoomed out a little more.  It was kind of Pablo Picasso-ish, though.  Yeah, but you knew what was going on.  But if you looked long enough, you're like, oh, my God.  And there's little Butters watching in the background.  And then he walks in on his father, who his private area is blurred out, but he's just 
[00:05:30]  jacking away in his bed.  Hi, Dad.  What are you doing with your wiener?  It was great.  Yeah.  We just watched it again in the office.  We were laughing our asses off.  Well, of course, Anthony, because we had to show prep.  Yes.  Well, let's go to Sean.  Sean, you're first on the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:06:00]  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Anthony, I got some audio.  Opie in the bathroom at age 13.  Oh, yeah?  Opie in the bathroom at age 13?  What are you doing out there, Dad?  Crinkle, crinkle.  Cut.  He's got the crinkle, crinkle.  He's got his little sound effects in him.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Bobby, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Guys, that was the first time I ever saw that show last night.  Yeah.  But when his father got caught, J-O last night, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen in  my life.  Yeah, when he opens the door and his father's just jacking it. 
[00:06:30]  Hey, Dad.  Hi, Dad.  And the father's like, oh, butters.  He covers off.  You see the wet spot on the mattress?  He has a little, like, jack.  Yeah, when they showed his cartoon yam bag.  I did see that.  He rolled over to, like, cover up.  And they showed his cartoon ass.  And you saw his yam bag hanging.  A little part of the yam bag.  Those guys are so twisted.  It rules.  Dennis, what's up? 
[00:07:00]  What's going on, guys?  Two things about that show last night.  Yeah.  Wasn't it great when they were singing a song and O.J. was holding the knife, like, bouncing  up and down?  Yeah.  I saw that.  The other thing is when he went into the steam room and he's like, Mr. Garrison?  He's like, who the hell is that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Garrison was in the steam room.  All right.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right.  So that was a lot of fun last night to check out.  Yeah.  And the wrestling.  I thought it said some black guy had dad pinned for 15 minutes. 
[00:07:30]  Doug, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I think I saw Norton in there with Garrison.  Yeah.  A lot of people are commenting that they might have saw at the White Swallow Spa.  Yeah.  I have an idea for the homeless.  Huh?  You round them all up.  You get them liquored up.  You get them on a bus with a bunch of hookers.  You take them up to a Mets game.  Oh, thanks.  General Norton.  All right.  The funniest part, though, was the ending.  When they had Butter's parents standing by the podium addressing South Park, saying 
[00:08:00]  that they apologize because...  We're making up the story.  We're making up the story.  The Puerto Rican killed their kid.  Yeah.  And they were talking about...  The father's talking about how he would be walking around, and he knew that the people  of South Park knew he was lying.  And he said what they would do is...  Now he's happy he can walk through South Park and not have people yelling certain things  at him.  And it was things like this.  Liar!  Tell us what you know, you goddamn liar! 
[00:08:30]  But every time he's screaming that, they would zoom in on O.J.'s face or Gary Condit's  face...  Or the Ramsey.  Or the Ramsey's face.  But he's talking about himself.  Like, now people won't be saying this to me.  And the second they go to the sound clip of him yelling liar, they show, like, O.J.'s face.  You're a liar!  You know something that you're not telling us, you slimy scumbag liar!  He's talking about himself, but they're showing the Ramseys.  Confess! 
[00:09:00]  Liar!  Confess!  Very funny.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to...  Oh, my God, is this a brand new character for the O.P. and Anthony show?  Oh, we love new characters.  Who's this?  Wait, Michael or 100?  Uh, I think you might have the wrong station, sir.  Wait, I didn't get my big-ass card yet.  Oh, you're calling the wrong show, sir.  Yeah, I want to pledge 30 listeners from my office.  No, no, no, no, you're calling the wrong show. 
[00:09:30]  What about the Donna Summer tickets?  Uh, that's actually...  What?  I think that was calling the wrong show guy.  Yeah, it could have been.  They may have dumped out the last part of his phone call.  But, yes, that was calling the wrong show guy.  I guess I should read this email from, uh...  From, uh...  Who is this from?  Uh...  Nope, nope, nope.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Yeah, they dumped it.  Uh...  Oh, God.  Breon.  Breon from Chicago... 
[00:10:00]  Uh, from...  Breon from Philly.  Okay, guys, I tried calling today about 40 times and no one answered.  I mean, I'm listening to your show right now.  It's about midnight here in Chicago.  Come on, guys, answer the damn phone.  Syndication guy.  He wants to be syndication guy, yeah.  Syndication on delay guy.  Right.  All right.  We should take our first break and, uh...  And get the show rolling, huh?  Sounds good.  Whoa, Ed, what's up?  Ed? 
[00:10:30]  Yo.  Hello.  What's going on, bro?  Hey, what's going on, Hope?  Listen, I need your wisdom.  Yeah.  I heard you say yesterday you finally got to Staunton Island.  Is that right?  Yes, in, uh, Grand Theft Auto 3.  Hey, did you do the first mission, uh, that the gook chick gives you?  Jeez.  The lesbian gook chick.  Yeah.  My God, man.  What's the mission?  Uh, when you have to get your old boss and kill him.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Have you completed that?  Yeah, that's easy.  Listen, I don't know.  I've completed every other mission, no problem. 
[00:11:00]  I'm having a big, big problem with this.  How'd you do?  Did you just run him off the road?  No, that's, uh, I tried that a million times, but, uh.  He was out in front of his house, stealing people's cars and parking them in front of  his driveway, and I sat there with a flamethrower.  Basically, so people could play along here, uh, you gotta go back to Portland, the city  you just came from, and you gotta kill the mob boss, right?  Right, right, right.  And he's gonna be leaving his club, so you gotta get there, uh, pretty fast to give yourself  some time, okay?  Right.  Then there's an alleyway that you gotta go down, and you climb the stairs. 
[00:11:30]  You gotta have the sniper rifle, my friend.  Oh, get out of here.  Did you snipe him?  It's so easy, and then you see the four, uh, the four, you know, the four of his guys  just kind of guarding as he's walking out of the alley, and you get a nice headshot.  Boom.  You know what, you know what's funny, like, if you just picture it in real life, here  I am in front of this guy's mansion.  Yeah.  Just standing there with a flamethrower in my hand.  Yeah.  And anybody who goes past me, I'm stealing their car, beating them up, and parking it  in front of this poor guy, this guy's driveway.  That's what I try to do.  I piled up as many cars as I can, but they, they just, they get through eventually. 
[00:12:00]  By the way, oh, just as a, uh, point of reference, I just wanted to, uh, I'm the conductor  who was busting your chops on the train about the token booth guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's up, man?  What's going on, dude?  Thank you all for the advice.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna turn off your show now, and, uh, play the game.  All right, man.  Bye.  You can listen to us and play Grand Theft Auto.  Yeah, you bastard.  Uh, Anthony, speaking of video games really fast, a fellow addict, this one's for you,  uh, uh, and it says, I too am a victim of Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  Why, it was just yesterday that I told my girlfriend that I had to stay late at work 
[00:12:30]  to get some things done.  Oh, no.  And couldn't have dinner with her until later, when in reality, I was playing in a 24-player  internet Wolfenstein game.  Oh, I haven't, uh, delved into the, uh, multiplayer yet on that.  I hear it's great.  Yeah, so that's Jeff.  He's completely addicted, and there's a system that works much better, so he's not going  at home.  Oh, the work system is better than the home system.  Yeah.  God damn, that's, that's bad.  He's got it bad.  And then Ben's yelling at me to stop playing Grand Theft Auto 3. 
[00:13:00]  Stop playing your games and go Christmas shopping, he's saying.  Well, he's pissed off because we got a lot of, uh, things where we could, uh, do in the  next few days.  And I, and I'm, I'm freaked out because I, I haven't started my Christmas shopping.  Yeah.  I haven't either.  We could go to a Nick game Sunday, we could go to a strip club on Monday, and I'm like,  I can't do anything.  No.  I, I, I, we have like five radio shows left before vacation.  Yeah.  So we want to try to go, put out some good radio shows.  And then I got a shop.  I, I do this every year.  I want, that's all, that's all I want to worry about. 
[00:13:30]  Every year I do this, and I suck at it.  I cannot Christmas shop.  I don't know what to get anyone.  So Ben's answer is stop playing Grand Theft Auto 3 and get out and do some Christmas shopping.  That'll do it.  I'm like, thanks, Sandy.  Yeah, that's what he said to me.  I don't like.  Are you spending a little too much time on the game?  Have you gotten any flack for it?  No, I, I, I kind of, uh, uh, involve Sandy in my gaming.  Is that what you did?  Yeah, I make believe I, I need her help and stuff. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God, I need the hospital.  My health is real low.  Where's the hospital?  Where's the hospital?  I know where the hospital is.  I'm, I'm really bad with, uh, of course, EverQuest, Evercrack.  Whenever I play it, there's a certain point where I have to recharge certain energies that, uh, I have.  So you, you pretty much just sit down, but you can't see the screen.  Now you're just, you're kind of in a meditative state.  And, uh, if something attacks you, it instantly goes back to first-person perspective. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  So I order, like, Chinese or something, and the, the person knocks on the door.  I go to the door.  I'm craning my neck, looking at the monitor, because if something attacks me, I have to drop everything.  The Chinese guy, wait, you're going to change!  And I'm running back to the computer to do battle, and I'm like, hold on there, Wang.  Don't, hold on.  There's something, I'm big, the hermit's killing me!  What do you order?  And I, I, I, I'm constantly craning my neck, please don't pop up, please don't, the games 
[00:15:00]  kind of take control-y a little bit there.  I got, I got to confess something, um, so I get off the Long Island Railroad today, and  I'm, uh, I'm walking to my subway.  Yeah.  I was in, uh, I was in game mode, and I was walking to the subway platform, and, uh, the  people, um, didn't look real to me.  Oh, that's bad.  I swear to God.  See, that's getting bad.  I was in a weird state.  I'm like, are these people real, or are they part of my game? 
[00:15:30]  When you, when you're taking it that far, maybe you ought to, like, slow down.  But it was really strange.  Yeah.  I, I, I saw myself walking, but I really wasn't part of my body.  Well, and then I was looking at other people, and I had to, like, think if they were real  or not.  Is there a push someone in front of a subway train option in there?  That's what was freaking me out.  Theft Auto.  I'm like, well, I could, I could jump on the tracks and, uh, try to kill somebody, and  if, if I die, well, they'll just put me outside the hospital, and I'll be okay. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, sure you will.  Man.  Yeah, it was a little weird today.  I think I, I'm playing way too much.  Oh.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  Phones are just lit.  We have to talk about the Bin Laden, the Bin Laden tape, I guess.  Ah.  Yeah.  I'm sure everyone has seen it by now.  Seen it, heard it, heard interpretations of it.  Everything.  Hey, we're breaking out our Christmas songs today, Anthony.  Great.  It was a holiday.  We did Brother Joe's, and we, I mean, we got all the crazy ones. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Uh, Mark Burnett from Survivor's, uh, going to be calling us to talk about Survivor 4.  Well, where the hell is that going to be?  Is Survivor 3 happening right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  Boy, he's got to be bumming.  Well, I feel sorry for the Survivor 3 people, because no one really cared after what happened  on 9-11.  I don't know what the, I don't know how the ratings are, but it's just, it's like the  general feel with our radio show.  Because, uh, 1 and 2, I mean, we spent a lot of time on, and our listeners were into it.  We had all the people come in. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Survivor 3, it's just kind of there.  Reality programming took a dump after September 11th, because we saw, I mean, the ultimate  reality television.  There wasn't one person that wasn't watching TV that day, and so everything happened live.  That's reality television right in your face.  Who cares if someone could do a goddamn challenge so their tribe can get some rice?  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  They really, they've got to compete against reality now. 
[00:17:30]  You know, those B-52s, bombing mountain chains.  Ooh, but, you know, can this girl get across the rope?  Across the lake?  Ooh, I'm thrilled.  You know, they've got a lot to compete with.  We have a plane going down the Indian Ocean, and we don't know if we're going to get the  guys in time before the sharks get them.  How about that, Survivor?  How about that, Survivor?  Four guys coming out of a B-1 and being picked up two hours later in the water.  You hear the pilot talking about that?  Sure beats eating bugs.  Yeah.  Ooh, eating bugs, or as the B-1 pilot put it, the most violent ejection he's ever, like 
[00:18:00]  the most violent thing to ever hit his body in his life.  When you pop the canopy of a B-1 and fire that seat and get hit.  You know, that's Survivor.  Not this planned out crap.  Boy, they've got a lot to compete with.  Survivor.  They really, really do.  Well, we'll talk to Mark about that, because I don't know how the hell, I don't know what  he's going to do. 
[00:18:30]  And I don't want to hear the secretive crap anymore.  Well, you're going to have to watch.  No, because I'm not.  I'm not going to watch.  If he told me something was going to happen, like the guy falling in the fire, that was  cool.  If the guy's killing the pig, that's still kind of cool.  Has anything happened in the Africa one that is remotely entertaining, or thrilling, or...  Man, what?  I saw the first, I don't know, two, I guess.  When did it start?  It started in...  August?  August, yeah.  And then September 11th happened, and I just blew it. 
[00:19:00]  Who cares?  Like you just said, who cares?  Yeah.  I have no idea what is going on in Africa.  I couldn't even tell you.  I even asked CBS to send me all the shows, so maybe we could catch up and try to do something  with it, with our show, and the box of tapes has just been laying in my living room.  I just don't care.  I understand about having a popular television show, and then have it take a dump on you.  Number one, Gelman, all week long.  Poor Regis, that's another one, that millionaire show. 
[00:19:30]  Well, we'll talk about that.  We've got lots to do today.  We really do.  As we take a break, let's check out and see what's going on on the FU line today.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opian Anthony FU line.  FU, Mark Shapiro.  FU for trading away one of the best second basemen of all time to the Mets.  FU, Mark, Fing Shapiro for breaking up the best.  Fing to infield tandem of Alomar and Pascal, and FU ONA, because now you've got one of the  best second basemen of all time playing for your Mets.  FU. 
[00:20:00]  Next message.  Here's a big FU to all you mother effers who leave big boardings in parking lots, and  don't do anything about it.  You and your family deserve to die.  Merry effing Christmas.  Next message.  Hey, I'd like to give a big FU.  I was coming home from Virginia to Philly, and some bitch wouldn't let me use the bathroom  when the store opened in a half hour.  So I feel I gave her a bigger FU when I f***ed in the parking lot.  Thank you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a f***ing you to Jeff Van Gundy for leaving the Knicks. 
[00:20:30]  This team already sucks, and it's going to make it worse.  F*** you, you bald bastards.  End of message.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  The WNEW.  I am the leader, the Peter, the Santa Maria, the Lucent, the rapist, the feels overseer.  My Ageness, my hordech, the priest of Irochima. 
[00:21:00]  The cross of my desire.  Speak now in the fire.  Hey, hey.  Speak now in the fire.  Hey.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Yeah.  These angry guys.  These guys are angry, and then they made a lot of money and got nice houses, 
[00:21:30]  and they couldn't be angry like that anymore.  I don't know what happened.  They're angry at the American dream.  Did well for them.  Yeah, then it worked for them.  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right, Anthony.  A lot of people want to be new characters on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, I see that.  On hold, we have believes everything other radio people say guy.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:22:00]  And this guy wants in.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, what's up?  This is really boring, brings nothing to the show guy.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys, what's up?  I saw South Park the other day.  Yeah.  It was really funny.  I like South Park.  I'm a South Park fan.  I remember once I watched it with my sister, and it was really funny because we were both  watching it, and we laughed, and she laughed, and I laughed.  And sometimes, when she comes home from school, we watch tapes of South Park because it's funny. 
[00:22:30]  All right.  You're not really bringing anything to the show.  But I watch South Park, and sometimes my mom watches it, too, and she watches, and all  three of us watch.  And it's really fun because it's like a family thing.  And we all watch it.  It's like really fun because South Park is funny.  You totally bring nothing to the show.  What happened?  I thought I'm funny.  I'm not funny.  You're boring, and you're not bringing anything to the show.  Oh, man.  Oh, but did I mention that I watched South Park?  Yes, you did.  Oh, man.  Oh, I'm sorry that I sucked today. 
[00:23:00]  I'm sorry.  But I'll call back later with another story.  All right.  Okay, thank you.  Bringing nothing to the show.  Oh, I apologize.  Sorry.  There you go.  Guys?  Oh, goodbye.  He brought nothing to the show.  Absolutely nothing.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, I'm a beat-a-joke-to-death guy.  No, we just had that guy on.  Yeah, look, I got my radio on, and I'm boring and not funny like everyone else who calls the  show.  Look, my radio is on.  Ha, ha.  I'm at Roosevelt Field.  Look at me.  I am so cool.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:23:30]  Beat-a-joke-to-death guy.  All right.  You're really beating that joke to death.  Hey, look, my radio is on.  I'm at Roosevelt Field waiting for you guys.  Look, I can hear myself.  Hee, hee, hee.  Look at me.  I am so cool.  I can make Opie laugh.  Hee, hee, hee.  Listen, you're really beating the joke to death.  Yeah, enough.  But that's my job.  I beat jokes to death.  Look at me.  I am boring and not funny.  All right.  There he goes.  Beat-a-joke-to-death guy.  Man, a lot of people want to be a new character on our show, Anthony. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  It's really annoying now.  Oh, we had to get to someone that's pissed off at us here.  What did we do now?  Jason in D.C.  Jason, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey, how are you?  I'm all right.  Cool.  I just got a question.  Yeah.  I hear a lot of jokes.  Yeah.  Coming from young guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  About Dominicans, Puerto Ricans.  What's the deal with that?  All right.  What was the last time?  Some Puerto Rican guy.  What was the last time we had a Dominican joke on?  There was something about the bus and something about the bus full of Dominicans.  You guys are making fun of the plane that went down, too? 
[00:24:30]  Come on, man.  What?  Was that something about Dominicans and Puerto Ricans with the plane?  Oh, the plane down.  The plane that went down in Queens.  And we made fun of that.  Yes, you did, sir.  Yeah.  What did we say?  Oh, boy.  I sure don't remember that one.  Well, I remember you guys talking about it.  You were talking about it.  Okay.  I'll give you that.  Talking about it.  Giggling about it.  Giggling?  No.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Oh, yeah?  No, we didn't do that.  I don't remember giggling.  And as far as making fun of Puerto Ricans, we were talking about the South Park episode 
[00:25:00]  last night.  Right.  With Butters.  Yeah.  I'm just curious.  What are you guys, by the way, O&A?  Anything else?  I'm a mutt.  Oh, yeah?  I'm a little of everything.  I'm a wop.  And Anthony's a wop.  Oh, yeah?  I go out with a Puerto Rican.  Do you really?  Swear to God, 100%.  Wow.  But she's like the fine-looking Puerto Rican.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, well, I don't know, man.  She doesn't have the big booty and the big, huge, oversized lips and stuff.  Yeah, I hear you.  But I did go to her house for the first time for Christmas, you know, a long time ago. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And one of her relatives did give her hubcaps for Christmas.  Hubcaps for Christmas.  That is a true story.  Oh, my God.  I don't know, man.  What are you?  What are you?  What are you?  What about Puerto Rican?  Oh, there you go.  Nothing wrong with that.  Yeah, I'm Puerto Rican.  I just heard a couple of jokes before.  You guys say no, but I don't know, man.  We joke about everybody, my friend.  Oh, we at least try to.  Well, I hear you.  But you guys are great, though.  Keep hugging hard nuts. 
[00:26:00]  The longer you listen, you'll realize we don't have an agenda, really.  Oh, yeah?  No.  We'll even argue both sides of topics and stuff.  I thought one of you guys was like a fruity little Jew or something.  No.  No.  Wrong show.  Wrong show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  All right, Jason.  Bye-bye.  You can come see for yourself when we make it to Washington one of these days.  When we build an audience down there.  Yeah.  We're great.  Look at how we have to treat it.  If that guy was from New York, we'd have to tell him to go, F is Puerto Rican self.  He's from D.C.  So we're like, oh, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  We'll talk to you about it.  Yeah.  God, I hate that.  We're being voted worst radio show in Washington, D.C., by the way.  Thanks.  Thanks for the support.  Thank you.  Yeah, thank you, D.C.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Good job.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  That makes us feel good.  Terrence, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Dude, how do you like the helicopter?  What helicopter?  You didn't get the G.I. Joe special action helicopter?  I had to crash that helicopter, Terrence.  Wait, you said in the helicopter?  Yeah.  It was so funny.  Yeah, because we were talking about old Christmas presents, 
[00:27:00]  and Anthony wanted the G.I. Joe helicopter when he was younger,  and his mom gave him a cheap imitation.  Yeah, it wasn't the one I wanted.  The one I wanted had, back in the older days,  it had battery power and rotors that spun,  and it was made just for G.I. Joe.  I got this 18-inch action figure helicopter from my mother,  and it sucked.  So then the other day, in the mail, we get a box,  and I open it up, and it's a G.I. Joe helicopter.  But it's made for the, like, three-inch action figure, 
[00:27:30]  and I sat there and spent about a half an hour snapping it all together,  putting the decals on it, putting everything together,  and the rotors on so the rotors would spin when you move some kind of a wacky thumb trigger thing,  and something horrible happened, Terrence.  Oh, no.  It went to make a turn, and it slammed right into my desk at full speed,  and pieces went everywhere. 
[00:28:00]  He really lost his ass, Terrence.  Oh, man.  Hey, is there any chance I could be screw those damn Dominican guys?  Well, sure.  There you go.  All right.  I got a character name now.  Everyone's got a character name.  Everyone's going to have a character by the time we're done with this.  Here's gets offended and can't take a joke guy.  What's up, bro?  Oh, hey, guys.  Listen, I mean, really, I understand you guys are all about comedy,  but with the homeless, it's just not funny.  I mean, you guys don't understand what it's like to be homeless. 
[00:28:30]  I used to work with the homeless.  It's just not funny, guys.  Don't you mean, baby?  I mean, there's a line you don't cross.  But it was kind of funny to have them in a mall with a bunch of people?  No, no, no.  Guys, you really don't get it, do you?  I mean, you really think that this is...  No one's laughing.  No one finds this amusing.  It's really, you cross the line.  And can't take a joke guy.  I'm just offended.  And by the way, I'm also...  I'm assuming that you can't take a joke because you were once homeless, right?  Yes, and I once worked with...  And I also now work with the homeless.  I'm also pretty upset at South Park because they're blaming it on that Puerto Rican guy. 
[00:29:00]  I work with a lot of Puerto Rican guys who are always accused.  It's just not funny because it's really sad when it happens, guys.  Oh, all right.  I'm sure I'll call you guys back later.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  It gets offended and can't take a joke on you.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't like that character.  No.  No.  You know why?  Because we had that guy on the phone so many times.  For real.  With different voices, different names.  But since we got here, believe me, enough calls from him. 
[00:29:30]  Uh, hi.  Who's this?  Hello.  Yo.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  It's Paul.  Um, but I've got a character for the show.  All right.  Really stone guy who calls up with something that he thinks is really cool to say on the air  and then forgets everything he was going to say when you guys put him on the air.  Stone guy, uh, you're on the air.  What do you got, man?  I don't know.  Just so I'd be, yes.  Now you're a cursed guy.  Hanging out at work doing a whole lot of nothing.  Your character.  Your character sucks. 
[00:30:00]  We didn't like yours.  His character sucked.  He was sucky character.  And you can't call up and say, I'm going to be such and such character.  You're just going to be the character.  Be the guy.  Don't you get it?  He's, I don't get the want to be a character on the show guy.  Oh, by the way, I don't, I don't answer to my name guys calling back.  Uncle John.  Hey, Uncle John, what's going on?  Uncle John.  Uncle John.  I hear something in the back.  John, John, you there?  Uncle John. 
[00:30:30]  John.  Jim, what's his name?  It's Uncle John.  Uncle John, you there?  Hello?  I hear something in the background.  Hey, if you're, if you're on the phone right now, say hi.  Say hi.  Hi.  Hey.  Oh, hey, you.  Talk.  What's up, Uncle John?  Who, who, who, me?  Oh, wow.  Hey, I made it through.  Wow.  What's up, Uncle John?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Well, now you're answering Uncle John.  Who's Uncle John? 
[00:31:00]  I'm Fred.  I think you might have, oh, that's it.  Very good.  Thank you, Uncle John.  See you.  But then he answered.  We caught him, Anthony.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  Yeah.  Who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony.  What's going on?  Help me.  What's wrong?  What's the matter?  I'm stuck in foundrymusic.com.  You're stuck in foundrymusic.com?  I clicked something, and I can't find my way out now.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a fun sight. 
[00:31:30]  I hope.  So you...  My real player rose up, and now I'm in somewhere in a dark corner.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know how to get out of foundry music?  No.  You went too deep in, see?  Everything's stuck, and it's blurry.  You're going to leave a trail of breadcrumbs.  Somebody ate them.  To find the way out of that goddamn sight.  Are you clicking out of those pop-ups as fast as you can?  That might help.  Don't they go on pop-backs now?  Pop-backs?  Where they pop up, but they end up behind your window, 
[00:32:00]  so that at some point you look at the toolbar on the bottom of your monitor,  and you've got 50 windows opened up.  Maybe that's where I went wrong.  We're going to get through those together.  Keep your nose up.  Keep your chin up.  We're going to get through this thing.  Hang in there, bro.  You'll get out of foundry music.  I hope.  Eventually.  All right.  There you go.  I hope he's trapped in foundry.  I understand.  I feel his pain.  They're called pop-backs?  Yeah.  I hate the ones that you just can't close.  How do you close those?  Those are called whack-a-mole ads,  because it's like whack-a-mole affairs. 
[00:32:30]  Right, right, right.  Because they keep coming up.  As fast as you close them down,  they ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Those are notorious porno sight banners.  But now the pop-backs, they pop up,  but they pop up behind your window,  so that when you close your window,  that's when you see them.  But the fact of the matter is,  if you don't have a really good computer,  and you have 15 windows open up,  it's going to slow everything down.  Right.  That sucks.  I hate those goddamn things.  And how many people are buying the little  10 times magnification hidden camera? 
[00:33:00]  It's every banner ad that pops up  is for a hideable video camera.  A nanny cam?  It's either a nanny cam or a spy cam or something.  They're constantly popping up on my monitor.  It gets to the point where,  all right, I'll buy it.  Just stop it already.  Anthony, tomorrow on the show,  one of our faves is coming back.  Last time he was in the area,  he was really, really sick.  Let me think.  And he still killed Brian Regan. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, goddamn Brian Regan.  Brian Regan and his brother.  Oh, no.  Who does comedy as well.  Oh, it's not like Gallagher and Gallagher, too.  No, no, no, no.  They do different stuff.  Does he do Brian Regan  when Brian is sick  or can't make it to that city  like Gallagher did?  No, he's got his own thing going,  and he's been touring forever.  No, forever.  Okay.  Put your raincoats on, okay?  We're going to smash the watermelon.  No, no, no.  Oh, no.  It's going to go all over the place.  It's a watermelon  with a big mallet in it. 
[00:34:00]  I call it mallet and watermelon.  Now, his brother's really funny, too.  Oh, okay.  You, too.  He does his own thing,  and Brian takes him on the road  from time to time.  You're a funny brother, too.  They're both going to be in here tomorrow.  They're playing Carolines?  Yeah.  Do they look alike?  That's the scary thing.  They look alike.  Well, a little bit.  They're not like Gallagher and Gallagher, too, though.  Right.  Let me put it this way.  Are they as funny as the Sklar brothers  from BattleBots?  Ugh.  So awful.  Ugh.  They have ruined a good show. 
[00:34:30]  Aren't they horrid?  Shut up and show the bots.  I want to see the bots.  We don't need you.  If you want to talk to them,  at least have the hot chick go over  so it gives you some eye candy.  All right.  Little eye candy.  Brian is the straight-laced Regan,  as we all know.  But he can drink.  Well, you mean as far as his language goes on the stage?  His brother, a little...  A little blue?  A little blue?  Some of the blue humor?  He's not a blue comic,  but he's a little further in that direction.  Will he say, God damn? 
[00:35:00]  I think he would.  Will he say the S word?  I think he would.  Oh, how about the F?  If it'll get him on Letterman,  I think he would.  Oh, oh.  Well, how's that going to...  F.  Does he go up on stage, though,  and he might use the F word?  How about the C word?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Remember Brian Regan doing that?  Oh, no.  This big C bitch comes up to me, okay?  She doesn't want to give me a twisty goo.  Oh, he's great, man. 
[00:35:30]  I've never seen his brothers.  I hear you saw him once, though.  In Boston.  Yeah.  Did he open for his brother?  Yes, I'm telling you.  That's so odd.  I saw this guy already.  And you're sitting there going,  is he going to be doing Brian-type humor?  Yeah.  He doesn't really.  Every once in a while, you're like,  wait, wait, that's kind of like a Brian thing,  but then you realize they're related as brothers.  You know, you have some similarities with your own brother.  I have some similarities with my brother, so...  But, yeah, he's coming in tomorrow.  The big red one's a red giant.  No, it's like a sun, only big,  and toward the end of its life cycle. 
[00:36:00]  So, they're playing Carolines.  They sell out every time they come to town.  The one you can't see is a black hole.  Gravity pulls light in itself.  This is a four-star recommendation from the Opie and Anthony show.  That's too much.  Four-star.  Four-star.  Emo Phillips would be a one-star recommendation.  Bach.  Brian Regan and his brother, four stars.  Mm-hmm.  Tickets do go really, really fast.  And tomorrow on the show, while they're here, Anthony,  because we like to get a little crazy when Brian's around. 
[00:36:30]  Of course.  Just to show them how sick and twisted we can be.  Yeah, we've got to keep up our...  Do you want to do the Xbox competition thing tomorrow?  Isn't that the one where we have gentlemen come into this very studio,  stand in some form of kiddie pool...  Right.  ...with a condom in their hand...  Right.  ...and they will be drinking water and have to fill up the condoms.  And the person that fills it up the most by 6.30, it'll start right at 3.  After filtering it through themselves, of course.  Of course.  We'll win the Xbox.  What if the condom breaks?  Well, that's what they have to worry about. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, see, that is a fine line.  You look over to your right, you see a guy's...  Oh, he's got more in his than I got in mine.  But mine might break if I try to put a little more in it.  But his might break, and then I'll be in the lead.  You know, a lot of strategy.  I don't think the condom's going to break from just...  You don't think so?  ...pure volume.  No, no.  If they let it stretch, it could break.  That's what I mean.  But I'm assuming they'll hold it.  Oh, ugh.  From below.  I said from below.  You're going to smell like the homeless bus.  So, we want to do that tomorrow as just a little side thing. 
[00:37:30]  Mostly outside the studio while we're hanging out with the Regan brothers.  Yeah.  For the Xbox, we have one more to give away before we go on Christmas break.  Makes a great gift.  Hell, yeah.  This is what we want to do.  We want to get all the cities that we're syndicated to involved with this competition.  So then all the individual cities can root for their guy.  Right.  Now, I know a lot of people that, you know, live in Cleveland or Columbus or Sacramento, Philly, Washington, Boston. 
[00:38:00]  You know, they're in New York for business or pleasure or for school.  Yeah.  We want to get some contestants that represent just about every city we're in.  Well, the way you would do that is by showing us a license that proves that you're from, you know.  Oh.  So, somebody comes in here.  They show a license.  Right.  And then they will represent their city that we're syndicated to.  Right.  What do you say?  Well, it would be an Ohio license.  Well, I know.  But then you just look at the address and go, well, it's Cleveland, Ohio. 
[00:38:30]  You idiot.  And then why would he care?  It's not in Cleveland.  God, this is hard.  Well, we just wanted a few different cities representing.  How's that?  Yeah.  So, we'll get contestants later on today for that.  It's not a Philly license.  And you will have to come down tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Trader Jake.  How you doing?  All right, Trader Jake. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, I got a character.  All right.  I want to be in a long-winded wow story without a point.  You know, like the other day, I was driving downtown 7th Avenue, and I wasn't sure which  way I was going to get out of the city.  And it was Wednesday.  You know, whiffle-mout Wednesday.  Right.  And, you know, I was going to go through the Lincoln Tunnel, but then I thought maybe I'd  go through the Holland Tunnel.  And, you know, I was driving along, and I saw a blonde in a red convoyable, but, you  know, she didn't wow me because she'd go past me.  So, you know, instead I went through the Battery Tunnel because I realized I actually 
[00:39:30]  had to go out to Staten Island for something.  And, you know, there was another chick driving by.  She had a Volkswagen Cabo Lake.  You know, she's real cute.  George!  I don't think she's so much dick.  George!  George!  George!  And, you know, she didn't see me, but, you know, I was, like, still driving.  That's back then.  Oh, my God.  And then, you know, I said, all right, maybe I'll go to the mall because it's nice that  maybe some chicks will be out by the mall.  So I was driving out to the mall, and then I was, like, a little book.  Long-winded wow story without a point guy. 
[00:40:00]  Thank you.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.  We'll save you from the train.  You've got to just be the guy, though.  You can't say you're going to be, you know what I mean?  Right.  Exactly.  We go right to the phone, and you're the guy.  Just be the guy.  Just be the guy.  You have to announce it.  Makes it fun for everybody to guess what guy you are.  Right.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  How you guys doing?  Hey, good.  Pretty good.  What do you have for the OPNA show today?  Well, I want you guys to know, you know, every time I'm listening to you guys, like today,  when you guys are talking about California, I drove my car right into a pole. 
[00:40:30]  That's funny.  I was sitting in a pole.  And the other day, when you guys went to the mall with those homeless guys, and I laughed so  hard, crashed right into a pole.  And I keep crashing my car.  You know what?  When that woman was licking Fanny Cain's toes?  Yeah.  That's what I did.  Yeah.  What?  I'm going through cars like crazy listening to you guys.  I'm assuming that you're crashing my car because the show is so funny, guy.  That's who I am.  I'm the guy that's crashing.  I'm going through cars like crazy, guy.  He's crashing his car.  And you know what? 
[00:41:00]  I bet when I listen to myself right now, I'm going to laugh so hard, I'll probably hit  the next pole.  You're going to crash your car.  Yeah.  I'm going to crash my car.  Oh, no.  I'm going to crash right now.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  There you go.  Crash my car because the show is so funny, guy.  Yeah.  How many times have you heard that one?  All right.  We got a little something that we can do before we go to break here?  You want to do a Christmas song?  Yeah.  We'll do one.  Christmas songs.  We got some from South Park.  We got some that have been made.  How about Merry F. and Christmas by Cartman? 
[00:41:30]  I like that one.  Is that Cartman?  No, it's Garrison.  Oh, that's Mr. Garrison.  You're right.  Mr. Garrison.  You're right.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  So stay right there.  Cueing up, cueing up, cueing up.  Good.  I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East.  No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus.  They have different religious beliefs.  They believe in Muhammad and not in our holiday.  And so every December I go to the Middle East and say. 
[00:42:00]  Hey there, Mr. Muslim.  Merry Christmas.  Put down that book, the Koran, and here's some holiday wishes.  In case you haven't noticed,  It's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Muslim ass and f***ing celebrate.  There is no holiday season in India, I've heard.  They don't hang up their stockings and that is just absurd.  They never read a Christmas story.  They don't know what Rudolph is about. 
[00:42:30]  And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout.  Hey there, Mr. Hinduist.  Merry f***ing Christmas.  Drink eggnog and eat some beef and pass it to the missing.  In case you haven't noticed,  It's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Hindu ass and f***ing celebrate.  Now I heard that in Japan, everyone just lives in sin.  They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin. 
[00:43:00]  On December 25th, all they do is eat a cake.  And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and try.  Hey there, Mr. Shintoist.  Merry f***ing Christmas.  God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.  In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do.  So let's all rejoice for Jesus.  Merry f***ing Christmas to you.  On Christmas Day, I travel around the world and say. 
[00:43:30]  Now it's Christmas bonus and all you atheists too.  Merry f***ing Christmas to you.  You're listening to the antics of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, they even have the music.  Here we are from WNEWFM 102.7.  Set up atop a presidential penthouse.  Overlooking the skyline of Manhattan. 
[00:44:00]  Made by the spread and labor of peasants from across the world.  All making tons of money here.  In the business called entertainment.  Entertainment.  Oh.  Oh.

[00:45:00]  Dumb Guinea from Boston writes, hey, I want to be a new character.  Can I be can't take a hint guy?  Oh, wait.  You already have him.  His name is Mr. DVD.  Nice.  Mike from Jersey.  Is the bring nothing to the show guy replacing Anthony the limo driver?  Oh, I like this guy from North Bergen.  He's hey, remember me guy.  Hey, Opie, remember me?  I was the guy at the Islander game who kept shouting. 
[00:45:30]  And Ant, remember?  I called a couple of weeks ago about that hot girl.  The remember me guy.  And then there's somebody commenting about Ron and Fez and how great they are.  It's instant feedback, the wrong show guy.  Hi, who's this?  Hey.  Hey, what's it?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, I was at...  Remember me? 
[00:46:00]  What's up?  Hello?  Hey, your phone sucks.  Hey, you guys...  That was the land, but...  Hey, Opie, I think it's bad cell phone guy.  Oh, bad cell phone guy.  Oh, I really thought it was phone sucks.  Hello, can you hear me?  Yeah, what's going on?  I think I'm...  Yeah, I think I'm in a bad...  Hello?  Bad cell phone guy.  Freaking phone?  Can you call back?  Call back.  Your phone sucks.  I think something's... 
[00:46:30]  I think you have a bad connection.  No, no, no.  Now it's working.  Now it's working.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's working.  You can hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah, fine.  Hey, I just wanted to...  You know what I'm saying?  Well, yeah.  Try calling back later.  Thank you, bad cell phone guy.  Wow, that is a bad cell phone.  I love the fact that our listeners are wise asses like us, man.  There's nothing new happening with these calls.  That's for sure.  This is crap we've heard for three years. 
[00:47:00]  Three.  Try...  Yeah, I know.  Closer to eight.  Where's...  Where's...  Knowing Laugh Anthony?  Limo Anthony.  Yeah, where is he?  Who brings nothing to the show.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Here he is.  Now, if you remember yesterday, I think it was, we were really railing Anthony, Limo Anthony  guy.  Hi.  And I had said, bring in a bottle of Dom.  Well, because you were really pissed at him because he made fun of your...  What did he do? 
[00:47:30]  He dissed my sister at some party.  You know the deal.  I just explained it to you, and I apologize about that.  You know that deal.  Is this dull, boring story guy going to show up here now?  So then Hank goes, you know, bring me a bottle of Dom tomorrow.  Yeah.  And I'll forgive you.  Look at what he's done.  So like a little pussy, you can't even know you're in the bottle.  Hey, wait till I have it.  And then I see he's also gotten something for my sister.  What is that?  A bottle of vodka?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  There you go.  Oh, this guy.  You're...  I need friends guy.  Shut up.  I am not.  There you are.  He's changed the subject guy.  Well, let me see.  Rick, could you pass that over?  There we go.  You're...  I'm so insecure.  I need friends guy.  It's all wrapped up.  Let me unwrap.  I can't believe...  Let me see what he got here.  Rick, I really don't even know what this is.  Yeah, it's a bottle.  I'm very surprised at...  Oh, look at the bottle of Dom. 
[00:48:30]  You are a pathetic guy.  He's been nice to you.  First time he's been having me six months.  Is it chilled?  Slightly.  What, you have it in the trunk of one of your limos?  No.  I need to buy you gifts for attention, guy.  Very good, Rick.  Well...  Give you to the studio gifts, guy.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  John, could you please put this in the refrigerator outside the studio? 
[00:49:00]  That's the cold one.  Why are you talking so slow to John?  There you go.  John, wait, wait.  He's taking ten steps.  John, could you put that in the refrigerator over by the phones?  I passed, make a right at the foosball table and put that in the fridge.  We call him memento guy.  John, do you have a cell phone on you?  I'll call you when you're halfway there and remind you what you were doing.  Can you tattoo instructions to your body? 
[00:49:30]  Tattoo it, memento guy.  John is memento guy.  Short-term memory loss guy.  There he goes.  Memento guy.  He screwed me up so bad today, and it was directly based on what a prick Opie is.  It's twofold.  It's how much he forgets.  And can you just tell people that I'm...  And what a prick you are.  Can you just tell people it's just a character I play, though?  Yeah.  It's a character 24 hours a day.  Come on.  It's not that bad. 
[00:50:00]  All I know is...  I play prick guy.  That's it.  While we are prepping for the show...  We were prepping today.  In the office.  Yeah.  We were prepping today.  Right.  And John isn't even an intern.  He isn't even an intern at this point.  Correct?  Yes.  He's a 350 an hour guy.  He's a 350 an hour guy here at N.E.W.  He's also more to get to work than actually make it.  And I yelled at him and said, you're overpaid.  But for some reason, the ritual of the show's coffee, it has become a ritual. 
[00:50:30]  Well, Ben, I don't know, you need a goddamn thermometer to know what Ben wants that day.  He's actually said this.  If the temperature is over 72 degrees, I need iced coffee.  Yeah.  If it's below 72, I need hot coffee.  We have lost our minds.  You can totally tell that we need to leave for a week or so.  Me and Ben want Brooklyn Diner coffee. 
[00:51:00]  Opie and Norton hate Brooklyn Diner coffee.  They want a coffee from a shop that I believe exists only on Mount Olympus.  No.  And comes out when the sun hits a reflector.  Because no one can ever find it.  It's called Philips.  And it's a block away.  Philips a block away.  And I'll go with the Europa coffee if they can't figure out how to get the Philips.  Europa sucks.  Me and Ben hate Europa.  I won't do the cafe lattes from Europa anymore, though.  It sucks.  So today. 
[00:51:30]  But John and many people that were before John, they can't figure out how to get coffee.  It's amazing.  One guy, like you said, we like Starbucks.  Philips is a pretty fancy coffee shop in our area.  Brooklyn Diner downstairs.  Nice coffee.  You send them to like a Philips or something, which I don't think is that hard to find.  They will come back with coffee cups with Greek writing on it and claim that they went to Philips.  From the Greek diner or something.  It's diner coffee because it has the Greek writing right on the side. 
[00:52:00]  And then they go, no, man.  I was at Philips.  And we're like, you're a lion.  They have the fancy Philips cups.  It has become this retarded ritual now to get coffee.  Now, this is what happened today.  And this is the price that your pal Anthony pays for Opie being such a prick.  No.  It came down to me getting screwed because Opie was a prick today.  Opie likes his coffee.  Likes it the right way. 
[00:52:30]  I'm on a cafe latte.  Right.  Cafe latte.  Half milk, half skim milk.  That's what it's got to be.  How hard is that?  Which is fine.  Cafe latte, half whole milk, half whole milk.  This isn't the prick part.  The prick part is that God forbid something isn't right or it comes from a different coffee place.  And I understand this.  If it's something you don't want, it's just something you want.  When you want something and you don't get it, it kind of gets you annoyed a little bit.  How many times have they screwed up our coffee order, though? 
[00:53:00]  A thousand.  All I'm saying is I am easygoing guy.  And I get effed because of it.  You know something?  If coffee comes and it's wrong, I'm just like, I'll put more sugar in it.  I don't care.  I never get upset with the people because it's like, who cares?  It's just goddamn coffee.  One day last week, it cost me close to 20 bucks to get a cafe latte.  Yeah.  And Mary walking, I believe, 36 miles of roads. 
[00:53:30]  Because she couldn't figure out where Phillips was.  I know.  And I told her right behind Carnegie Hall.  Right there.  No, no.  Indiana Jones has to go to the map room with the pole and the crystal on it.  And when the sun shines, it tells you where Phillips is.  I know it doesn't exist.  It exists.  No, it doesn't.  Stop it.  So, can I defend myself?  Because today, I was in a bad mood because of Mr. Fuji screwing up my sushi order.  Fuji screwed up his order.  Gave him fatty tuna.  Tastes like margarine rice. 
[00:54:00]  I hate the...  That's my line.  I know.  I was quoting you.  Okay.  Well, I'm sure.  I was quoting you.  Don't rip me off.  Who?  Who?  No.  Well, the fatty tuna, these stupid sushi places think it's a delicacy.  They're doing you a favor by giving it to you.  It's a piece of margarine on rice.  It has the same texture when you put it in your mouth.  It's disgusting.  So, I had to call Mr. Fuji and give him some of my business, man.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I was supposed to add a bag into my heart. 
[00:54:30]  I asked for tuna sushi.  They gave me the fatty toro, whatever they call it, crap.  Waitress, we took order.  We go to a Yankee Cranky shop.  She walked her way up from Yankee Cranky to a nail shop to a sushi restaurant.  Now, she screw up a Mr. Gray's order.  Go right back to Yankee Cranky.  That's my bit.  I know.  I'm quoting your bit.  It's an homage.  All right.  Thank God.  One of my only bits.  Well, try it on the air. 
[00:55:00]  Thanks, Jay.  It's going to be just in the restaurant.  Jesus.  Thanks, Jay Moore.  Maybe you and your rice.  So then I beat up our Xbox and the Xbox games.  I was so pissed.  He rips the drawer out of his desk and starts throwing his drawer.  Oh, man.  I didn't want the fatty tuna today.  And I'm like, all right, well.  He's back.  We didn't have time.  It was too late in our show prepping, remember?  Yeah.  Here's where I get screwed today.  So then I just.  All right.  Here's where I get screwed. 
[00:55:30]  Opie brings up that he's going to get a mocha.  What were you getting?  A latte.  Cafe latte at Starbucks.  So I'm like, you know something?  John's going to Starbucks.  I'm not going to have him go to Brooklyn Diner also.  Although he had to because it was over a certain temperature.  And Ben needed his ice cold.  That's true, too.  Can we make sure that the listeners realize that John is dumber than a box of rocks, right?  Oh, God.  For this bit.  Because that's the truth.  It's not that his whole mind is so full of video games and video game knowledge, everything  else has fallen out.  Like you're graduating college and you're having an argument with Mary how to spell Los 
[00:56:00]  Angeles?  Holy S.  I spelled the right.  It turned out you spelled the right.  Congrats.  Okay.  This is how we show up.  So here's what happened.  I give John $5 because I know he's going to Starbucks.  I know it's very hard for everyone to pony up the cash for some reason.  So I give John the $5 knowing that I'm going to get my coffee and I don't care who else.  I don't want change or anything.  It doesn't matter.  Opie gives him this gauntlet. 
[00:56:30]  He lays down a gauntlet for John.  You go down there.  I am timing.  Jesse goes, just like Grand Theft Auto 3.  This is a timed mission.  I'm telling you.  Now he's just, because now I'm living a video game right now.  Put it this way, too.  Opie is completely effing with him.  Just, he's tooling with him.  It's fun.  So John gets so serious about this and Opie tells him, look, if the order is bad, I hope  you know I'm going to throw it at you.  Just to see the look on John's face because it's kind of funny to watch. 
[00:57:00]  But then when he laughs, I made sure you guys realize that now I committed myself and  if he comes back with the wrong order, I have to do it because I'm all talk, no action lately.  You wanted a large cafe latte.  I wanted, I asked John for a large caramel mochiata.  And I'm like, oh, what are you insane?  He's going to go to a sushi restaurant with an order like that.  He doesn't know what a mochiata is.  Ah, mochiata.  He wrote it down phonetically so he can just say it to the guy.  I thought he was going to come back with some shrimp dish with brown sauce. 
[00:57:30]  What the hell is a mochiata?  You know what happened?  I had not put the fear in him that Opie did.  I had not frightened him enough that he got mine right.  Well, well, here's what happened.  One thing you're forgetting?  Yeah.  I didn't give any money.  No, no.  Because I thought you were, and you know, before, I mean, the old gag, I know, ha, ha, ha.  But in this case, though, hold on.  You gave three dollars an extra change.  Shut up, you douche.  At least we all can hate you. 
[00:58:00]  Anthony.  Yeah.  We take turns buying coffee.  So I assumed that you were just buying my coffee today.  I had no clue.  Short arms.  He never asked me for money today.  I was, but see, the thing is, Ben put in three, Anthony put in five.  And I found this out after the fact.  I was handed, I think Ben handed me, just eight bucks.  So I figured just everybody put in.  You know what I mean?  No, it's, well, you know, I don't know what he's talking about.  Can I go to Lee real fast? 
[00:58:30]  Because he brings up a good point, but I have an answer to this.  Lee.  Yeah, what's up?  Go ahead, real fast.  Listen, instead of your half skin milk, half whole milk, how about one or two percent?  Exactly.  Oh, there you go.  But I'd do it the other way, just to F with him.  And trust me, he couldn't even figure it out.  And then he's getting paper.  I'm like, and then he's like, okay, what was that again?  I'm like, you're like the guy from Memento.  You don't remember anything.  So here's where me not putting the fear into John effed me. 
[00:59:00]  I put in five bucks.  I wanted the large caramel mochi on.  And at this point, our show prep had to stop because now he's on a time mission,  and he only had 15 minutes, so we're all just sitting there watching the clock.  Watching the clock.  We're grown men at this point, but we're freaking retarded still.  John gets back just about on time.  We gave it to him.  He was a little over, but he's very happy.  Rick effed with him on the way out to mess him up for about 30 seconds, so I gave him the 30.  He's very happy about his going to get the coffee. 
[00:59:30]  He feels he did a great thing.  He hands Opie.  He's large.  He plunks it down on the big desk.  And then everyone at this point, Rachel, everyone else who's in the office, about 10 eyes,  now are staring at me like I'm the kid from the Twilight Zone movie, Anthony.  Is it okay, Anthony?  Right.  I'll send you to the cornfield.  So everyone...  Sure, Anthony.  That's your coffee, Anthony.  It's wonderful coffee, isn't it?  Sure it is.  So you can hear a pin drop in our office at this point as I'm inspecting the order. 
[01:00:00]  Now remember...  Then there was a big, ah, because my order was right.  Opie cracks open the top of the coffee container and sees it is indeed a large cafe latte as per instructions.  Now John turns to me.  I was tipped off right when he walked in.  I saw the coffee holder and what amounted to a paper shot glass in the coffee holder.  And I go, all right, is that mine? 
[01:00:30]  He goes, yeah.  And get this.  Guess what he says.  He goes, I had to get you the small because I didn't have enough money for everything.  I put in five effing dollars.  You put in the most money.  Now the thing is, if Opie hadn't given money that day, you would think, all right, Anthony gave me five.  I'll make sure he has the large.  Opie, sorry, you've got to get the small because you were the one that didn't put the money in that day.  And, but no, he never imagined not getting Opie the exact order because Opie would have thrown it at him. 
[01:01:00]  And me, I'm like, okay, I'm the good guy.  Well, I'm going to start being a little more of a prick.  I started laughing.  I'm going to start busting some heads.  It needs to be, a couple things need to be said now, Anthony.  Yeah.  This was right before showtime.  And so then everyone marches down the hall to the show.  Wow, you're, you're, I'm losing my effing mind, guy. 
[01:01:30]  Was that filled?  Yeah.  I just threw my full coffee at you.  You're never going to get a small cup of coffee ever again, see?  See, you've learned from the master.  I am proud of you today, my friend.  Well, I have it, Opie.  So, a couple things happened.  And the whole, the whole show marched down to the studio to, to, to set up for showtime.  Yeah.  I, I stayed back with John and the cup of coffee just threw.  I, I had John get you another mocha cheetah, whatever it's called. 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  Mocha chino.  Mochiata.  Mochiata.  Whatever the hell they call it.  And we're walking down the hall and John goes, you know, you put me in a bad position.  I had to make a decision.  I know.  He had to make like a command decision at that very moment.  Decide who gets the large cup and who gets the small cup.  Because, because it was directly, he did an assessment of who's going to cause him more damage.  Right.  And he realized, all right, you know, I got to get, go opiate order, even though it was Anthony's money.  Right. 
[01:02:30]  Holy Christ.  Karma mochiata, coffee latte, do your vaginas itch when you drink your coffee?  That's from Joey in D.C.  He's so right, man.  You're right, man.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Bob?  Hey.  Let me ask you a question.  So how much money have you wasted on bad coffee so far?  We go through a lot of money on coffee alone.  It's really silly at this point.  So why don't you guys just get a coffee maker?  We have, let me tell you something.  Oh, my God.  We have the greatest coffee machine ever invented, right outside the studio.  This is, you press a button and coffee comes out of here. 
[01:03:00]  Espresso comes out.  Mocha Espresso.  Mocha Espresso comes out.  Hot chocolate.  It is.  It's Pete Johnson's dream machine.  It's the Pete Johnson dream machine.  I am constantly making sure that that machine is mechanically sound to deliver coffee.  Yeah, this coffee machine is so complicated, the head engineer of this radio station spends  more time making sure all the parts and everything is in order there.  I'm the only one authorized to service it.  On the studio. 
[01:03:30]  That thing is open every day and he's replacing parts.  He's always in there.  I swear to God.  He's got like a creeper like they use at the garage and rolls himself under.  And he's got socket wrenches.  I don't know what he's doing, but he makes sure that thing works.  Why don't you guys get a little personal?  What do you want?  Does it have John make coffee in the office for you?  It just shows you how retarded we are.  I'm telling you, everyone that has come and checked out the show live has had coffee from  that machine.  It's an amazing machine.  But we'd rather send John on the street because it's so entertaining because you just don't 
[01:04:00]  know what he's going to bring back.  Yeah, we have no clue what he's coming back with on any given day.  And this is not just coffee, John.  It's not just coffee.  Ah, come on.  We love you.  It's fun.  It's so much fun.  Go try yourself off.  I was like, oh, I was throwing things.  That was hilarious.  Hi, who's this? 
[01:04:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, who's this?  What's up, man?  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  Ah, you're talking to Opie and Anthony.  No, no, no.  I mean, I called the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  Ah, yeah.  No, you see, you're talking to us.  Dude, you're on the air.  Yeah, you're on the air.  No, no.  Yeah, I called in.  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  I called from Cleveland.  Yeah, hey, Cleveland.  No, this isn't Stinkier Rachel.  You're actually on the show now.  You're on the air.  I'm calling to talk to Opie and Anthony.  You want to know what I want to talk about, or what do I do now? 
[01:05:00]  No, you're on the air, so now you should just say what you want to say.  Yeah, but I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  Hello?  This is, I think I'm still talking to the phone screener guy, Anthony.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  I think I'm talking to the phone screener guy.  Let's take a break.  All right.  Do we have a little sound before this here?  Very therapeutic.  What?  Huh?  Champagne's cold.  Oh, God.  Champagne's cold.  See, you had to talk.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  They just talked for 20 minutes, and they didn't even acknowledge that I'm in the studio. 
[01:05:30]  Shut up.  I've got to say something before break.  Idiots.  Die.  I wish you'd die.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Rip it off Mark the chef.  Yeah, we believed that until after the show.  Ten messages on my scene.  I didn't really mean to say that.  You're not going to send me to the studio.  I'll give you a free little ride to wherever you want.  Annoying laugh, Anthony.  I'm I act tough, guys.  All right, Ann. 
[01:06:00]  We don't have something?  No?  We don't have our Christmas song, though?  Thank you.  Huh?  Christmas song after you?  Uh, see if we were prepared.  Nah, we can play that a lot.  All right, we'll just take a break.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  We're a bunch of perverted crackers.  Oh, what?  It's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other?  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  A couple of things off the instant feedback. 
[01:06:30]  Nick writes, did John have to pick up a hooker and get his health up so Opie could get his coffee?  And Danielle from Jersey writes, dear Opie and Anthony, I would like to take this opportunity  to let you know how disgusted I think it is how you take advantage of women.  What?  Take Patty, for example.  Take advantage of an insecure woman who is that way because of the restraints men put on her in this society.  Uh-huh.  You should be ashamed. 
[01:07:00]  If you'll excuse me, I have a PETA meeting to go to.  That's from Feminist Chick Woman.  Ah, okay.  By the way, I just want to announce that I followed the PART protocol.  Yeah, I noticed that.  Set up by you, Anthony.  Well, it's very important that this studio remain fart-free, a fart-free zone.  Now, we have no crunching in the bathroom right outside the studio.  Why?  No ventilation. 
[01:07:30]  It stinks up the outside and the studio.  Right?  Right.  If people are just blasting farts here in the studio, it stinks up the studio.  So, Opie said, yes, well, I go outside or I go to the window.  Well, the window, because we're in a floating studio.  It's called a floating studio where the floor, walls, and ceiling aren't really attached to the building itself.  It's done with shock absorbers and all kinds of sound things, so the rest of the sounds stay outside of the studio. 
[01:08:00]  So, in between the wall to the studio and the actual wall to the building is a space about three, four feet wide.  Crawl space.  Crawl space.  A lot of the interns like to go out there and get high and look at the pretty buildings at night.  Right.  And there's a little trap door by some of the equipment over there that Opie has used to go in and fart.  I don't even go in.  I just kind of hangs his ass through it and lets one rip.  And then I never understood this with people that fart elsewhere because they don't want to offend anyone. 
[01:08:30]  They blast it wherever they are and then immediately walk back to where they were standing.  Well, John did that last week.  Not to harp on John again, but he dragged a beauty back in with him last week.  You know something?  If you were to take a, I don't know, a fart cam, some camera that picks up fart like infrared or something like that,  you would see that after you blast it, it's going to stay in your pants.  It's going to just linger around your aura and come right back in with you. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, Norton farts in here all the time, by the way.  And they stink.  Yeah, well, that's why you came up with the fart protocol.  It doesn't help if you go outside and come right back in.  Yeah.  So the new protocol, which Opie just did, thank you, Opie.  I was kind of bummed because I knew there was going to be no problems, let's say.  I just knew.  No, you think there's no problems.  I'm percolating today, but I knew there was no problems.  Well, you never know because maybe there wasn't a problem in the last one.  I'm like, oh, I ain't set a rule.  This sucks.  So then I got up and did exactly what you told me to do. 
[01:09:30]  We now must walk outside.  Which is the, you have to do the fart.  Yeah.  The pat down.  The pat down.  And then the arm waving behind you.  Right.  Dispersal technique.  So I did it.  And Stinky's laughing his ass off.  Because if you just blast one and come back in, it's going to follow you.  If you blast one and just do the arm wave dispersal technique, it's still going to stay in your pants.  What you must do is fart, do the pat to then get it out of your pants, then the arm wave dispersal, and sometimes even the circular walk, and then back in. 
[01:10:00]  But I'll throw you one if you didn't do the circular walk.  Circular walk, too?  That gets it away from you.  See, even if you pat, it could still be around you to follow the air current of you walking back in.  Are you trying to tell me I need to confuse the fart air?  Yes, it stirs it up so it can go off in another direction while you make your escape back into the studio. 
[01:10:30]  Like a mini fart tornado.  A little fart monsoon.  Typhoon.  I feel bad for Steve, then.  Why, where are you?  The fart tornado is going to go in that direction right into the studio.  Well, thank you, anyway, because Norton's always doing it in here, and it stinks.  Hey, kids, can you tell we need a vacation soon?  Oh, yeah.  You know, I've got to be careful how I say this, because the person didn't want me to mention this on the air today.  Yeah.  But my brains are scrambled. 
[01:11:00]  You got smacked in the head.  Really hard, and this person scrambled my brains, and I really need aspirin.  She hit me so hard straight down on the top of my head that it scrambled my brains, and my brain feels like it's floating right now.  Send John out.  I'll bring some Pamperin back for you or something.  I'm sure he will.  I'll bring back friggin' Valium.  Now, you may ask why I got hit really hard on the top of my head. 
[01:11:30]  I think it's safe to say that there are plenty of women in this area.  Yeah.  So I think I can say this without giving it away, right?  And don't give it away, because she's freaked.  Because I know what you can do to give it away.  Gee, give it away.  Give it away.  I didn't give nothing away.  Of course not.  I picked up my golf club, the golf club I will be using for the golf ball trick.  I just stared in disbelief when I saw this today. 
[01:12:00]  And I was watching it going, what are you doing?  And I poked someone's boob today.  Yeah.  Holy S, you gave me a beating.  Well, she's just standing there, and you have the golf club in your hand, and she's talking about something.  And you go, your boobs are looking big today.  And then, wah, takes the end of the golf club, and lifts, like it lifted one of her boobs up at the end of the club. 
[01:12:30]  Wah, wah.  And she leaned over and smacked you upside the head.  So hard.  So hard, man.  It's like this, two-headed poke, like, wah, wah.  And then the handle disappeared, didn't it?  How long before we just blow it and let everyone know who it was?  No, no, no, no, no.  She's going to kill me.  But if it does get out, no.  But if it does get out, I will take full responsibility, and she did the right thing. 
[01:13:00]  How's that?  All right.  No!  Don't!  Don't, Ann.  Don't.  Do it!  Don't.  Do it!  Don't!  Do it!  What?  Do the wacky horn.  Our listeners are smart enough to figure it out now.  Do the wacky horn.  They know what's going on.  I did nothing.  I tooted the wacky horn.  All right.  Stop. 
[01:13:30]  Stop.  All right.  No one was jet skiing.  You're thinking of that.  I'm thinking of that.  Right.  All right.  Well.  I'm thinking of that.  I'm thinking of that.  I'm thinking of that.  I'm thinking of that.  I'm thinking of that.  I'm thinking of that.  Stop.  Oh, there you go.  It was my fault.  And I'm paying for it right now.  You got a headache?  Bad.  Really bad.  Really bad.  John, can you go out and cop some heroin? 
[01:14:00]  There.  He'll come back with aspirin.  Tuttle.  Tuttle from New York.  Adam, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I'm calling from Baylor, New Jersey.  I just thought I might let you know how sick this world is.  How sick is this world?  Like we don't know already.  Yeah, you probably do.  But a guidance counselor, a female, about 45, she sexually assaulted a sophomore in my high school.  Sexually assaulted? 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Wait, wait.  Guy or girl?  Guy.  Guy did the assaulting?  No, the guidance counselor was female.  Guidance counselor was female.  Let's slow down.  45-year-old lady assaulted a 16-year-old male student.  Yes.  How do you do that?  How does she go about doing that, by the way?  Very carefully.  What happened?  Oh, it was all over the Jersey Journal.  Yeah, well, how's the story go?  Yeah, help us out.  Don't be a guy today. 
[01:15:00]  Don't be a new character.  Yeah.  We don't get the Jersey Journal.  Yeah.  Really?  Tell us what happened.  What happened?  Well, geez, the story, I'm not exactly sure, but...  Hey, you're the best character yet, and you're not even trying to be a character.  See, this is why the characters are so goddamn funny.  This guy ain't trying.  It's, I can't tell a goddamn story on the air, guy.  Did it really happen, though?  Yeah, sure. 
[01:15:30]  I'm completely serious.  I've heard of these stories before, apparently, I guess, this guidance counselor.  Was it sexual?  Can you answer us that?  Yes, it was.  All right.  What kind of sexual?  Was it what?  What?  Was it oral?  Or was there...  Well, I have no idea how far it went, but it was sexual.  Yeah.  And I have talked about this in the past.  We've got to be careful, because people get really pissed off at us.  But when I was 16 years old, I was hoping that a 45-year-old lady would have attacked me in school. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, that doesn't seem to carry...  There's a huge double standard.  Not many guys will announce to the world that they were sexually assaulted by an older woman.  Yeah.  That's just the facts.  Not in a bad way.  You'll tell your friends about it.  Oh, yeah.  That's what you'll do.  And you'll be like the king of your block.  Yeah.  People will be like, way to go, dude.  There's a huge double standard.  If you're a guy, guidance counselor...  45-year-old guy.  It even sounds bad.  45-year-old guy.  Yeah, guidance counselor, 16-year-old girl.  And all of a sudden, you start doing stuff. 
[01:16:30]  Everyone asks for the guy's nuts on a platter.  You know what I mean?  Like, kill this guy.  And everyone feels very sorry for the girl.  When you get a 16-year-old boy and a 45-year-old woman guidance counselor,  now it's like, all right, you know, hey, Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me, kind of thing.  Then it becomes just the guy getting his rocks off.  So, I hung up on him, Anthony.  Yeah, he couldn't really tell the story.  It was kind of frightening.  Sully, what's up?  What's up?  I got another unlucky lottery for you. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Okay, in Pennsylvania, on a highway, a tractor-trailer plowed into a funeral procession.  Yeesh.  So, I think God hates you when he kills you twice.  Wow.  Funeral, a tractor-trailer plows into it.  And where did this happen?  This was just today.  It's not unlucky lottery, is it?  I'll tell you, unlucky lottery.  And you read one of these a year in the paper.  Yeah.  Freaking the couple that gets killed in the limo after their wedding. 
[01:17:30]  Holy ass.  Ugh.  That's...  Blood-sided or something.  That's unlucky lottery right there.  Where did that happen again?  Huh?  Yeah.  Did that happen recently?  There's one a year, man.  Yeah, I know.  It happens all the time.  It's awful.  One a year, somewhere in the country, someone will die on the way from getting married in  the limo.  That's awful.  While they're driving in the limo.  Or one will live and one will die.  Oh, that's the awful thing.  They've got to both croak together.  You know what I mean?  Right.  See that woman that her husband died in the World Trade Center? 
[01:18:00]  She couldn't take it?  She's like her friends were all freaking out.  Yeah, big story about her and everything.  She killed herself.  She shot herself in the head.  You know?  Some stuff you just don't recover from, I guess.  All right, Sully.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bill.  Someone else is going to try to tell us the counselor's story.  Bob, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I got the story.  The kid was being tutored by her, and they ended up sleeping together.  But years ago, she had married another student who was 18 years old.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  I have no clue what the story's about.  She was tutoring, but years ago, she married a student.  Another student that was 18.  So did this happen years ago, or did...  No, it just happened.  It just happened?  What, the marriage?  Yeah, this just happened.  Did they die in a limo, Chris?  What?  No.  No?  All right.  Thank you.  Joe, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, Joe.  What's up, Joe?  Hello.  What's happening, guys?  What's up?  You tell us.  Dude, I'm the guy that gets hung up on for being serious.  What?  I call up before.  I'm like, yo, this is one of the funniest shows you guys have ever put on.  And then whoever else finished, they're like, click.  Yeah, they click.  I can't believe you.  I can't believe you have a guy calling from the morning show.  All right, Joe.  Even that's all right.  All right.  Well, thank you.  No, but really, you guys are putting on a really good show.  I just wanted to say it.  I've listened to it a long time.  Really?  Well, thanks.  Definitely, man.  You guys are totally natural and totally funny. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, there you go.  I should get knocked on the head more often for poking great with golf clubs.  I thought it was such a normal, natural thing to do.  Yeah.  The poke stick.  It's not your sister.  Sure.  I don't poke my sister ever.  No, but if you're a kid.  I never touched my sister.  I never.  But, I mean, if you're like a teenage kid, like every, you know, brother's going to be  like, ah, gah, and try and poke them if they need to annoy them.  You poked your sister's boobs?  You poked your sister's boobs?  Did you ever do that?  No, I'm sure I did. 
[01:20:00]  Did you ever do that?  I'm sure I did.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  I didn't, like, grab them and go, ooh.  I didn't do that either.  How did you do that?  That's like, that ain't right.  Hold it.  Hold it.  That's some Puerto Rican guy.  What?  What?  Nothing.  What?  Nothing.  Say it.  No.  You poke your sister's breast.  When you're a kid, maybe you do stupid stuff like that, yeah.  I never did that.  We used to, like, play tag and stuff with my sister.  Can you do it by the stage? 
[01:20:30]  No, no, no.  The second she got the little nubs, all physical contact stopped with my sister.  That is so true.  There was no playing of games or anything.  Before that, you still think, well, because we're all close in age in my family, like,  oh, she's a guy like us.  I don't really understand the sexist thing yet.  But you're right.  As soon as those boobs start popping, you're like, whoa, okay, you're a whole different  thing going on.  Well, for me, it was that she's getting too old.  No, I'm kidding, of course.  She had, yeah, yeah.  It was like, you just didn't want to accidentally grab anything.  She got married, huh? 
[01:21:00]  You didn't want to grab anything, you know?  But you're there on purpose, just boom, boom, poking your sister in the cans.  And you just, like, you run around going, ooh, look what I'm going to do to you.  It's just like, hey, you got to, you got to, you got to, you got to, you got to, grabbing  him.  Hey, Anthony, Jessica.  Jessica.  Third try at the story coming up.  Right?  Jessica.  I hope I do it justice this time.  I'm reading it right off the net.  Oh, good.  It says that she was at the school for about 24 years.  Right now, she was arrested on Monday. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  And so far, she's been charged with sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child, and  child abuse.  That is funny.  It was a 16-year-old student.  And that's all they're saying.  You're not really getting into much detail.  Sexual assault?  Yeah.  I guarantee the kid did not tell.  Yeah.  I guarantee the mom found a note, or one of the friends told somebody who told somebody.  16-year-old kid's not going to tell.  And it is true that she did marry a couple years earlier an 18-year-old student.  Right.  That's the part of the story that we don't really care about. 
[01:22:00]  Well, okay.  Jessica, do you agree that it's a double standard as far as that stuff goes?  Well, of course it's a double standard.  There's no way he would tell if you're getting banged by a hot teacher.  Yeah.  The last person you're going to tell is your mother.  Right.  All right.  I've got to cut you off, because one of Rick's sisters is on the phone.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Here's the lovely Erica.  It's girl, that brother copped the feel off of gal.  Erica.  Yeah.  You're on the radio.  Okay.  Hello.  Ricky. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, Ricky.  Remember the time when you bit our older sister's boob when you were little?  You bit your sister's boob?  What the F?  Man.  How old were you?  I don't remember that.  How old were you?  How old were you?  In the single digits, like, very young.  That doesn't matter.  Yes, it does.  Tommy just brought it up.  There's a big difference between two and nine, Mr. Single Digits.  You used to bite your sister's little nubs?  How old were you?  How old was he, Erica?  She said he's real little.  See?  Biting your sister. 
[01:23:00]  Made her bleed, too.  Made her bleed.  Oh, God.  You're awful, man.  Did he ever poke you in the boob?  I don't remember that, no.  Well, yeah.  He's just biting.  Yeah, you must not have been a spider.  A spider.  Yeah.  A spider.  All right, Erica, thank you.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Yeah, thanks.  Some Puerto Rican guy. 
[01:23:30]  That's right.  All right, well.  Do we have audio with that?  We do?  How about that?  Let me go to Jerry.  Jerry, what's up?  You're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey, Jerry.  My life sucks, man.  What's the matter?  I'm thinking about taking it. 
[01:24:00]  Taking what?  My life, man.  Yeah?  I can barely do it anymore.  Well, what's the matter?  Are you depressed?  Just everything sucks, man.  You know, and I don't have an Xbox.  You don't have an Xbox?  Are you trying to be suicidal and only my favorite radio guys can save me guy?  That's it, man.  Oh, damn.  I got it.  I got that one.  You got it.  All right, bye.  Later.  Here's Rick right after. 
[01:24:30]  I got a quote from Rick right after he bit a sister's boob.  This is legal, isn't it?  Oh, no, no, no.  It might be legal, but it's not moral or nice.  Hey, find the most erratic part of a woman.  He's the boobies.  What's this over here?  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  There you go.  That would have worked if he wasn't buying something.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Anthony, we're going to get our contestants for the Xbox competition. 
[01:25:00]  That's going down tomorrow when the Regan brothers join us for the show.  Okay.  Brian Regan, a four-star recommendation from your pals,  Opie and Anthony, playing Carolines this weekend.  Tickets go really fast, and he's bringing his brother in tomorrow,  and we're going to have a little competition for our last Xbox of the season, okay?  Yes.  So we'll get our contestants next, so stay there.  As we go to break, a little Cartman Christmas thing here.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Stockings are hung on the chimney, and the presents are under the tree.  And Mama's in the kitchen, making some herbal tea.  The windows are covered with frost, and the candles are all alight.  But as I wander through this quiet house, something just doesn't seem right. 
[01:26:00]  You see, every year, the neighbors bring us this way to call any beef love.  But the neighbors aren't around, around, around.  There's no beef love to be found this year.  No beef love.  Christmas isn't Christmas, without his wish, couldn't he be blessed. 
[01:26:30]  Without the Jesus enemies, I don't think I can get around.  Mother tries to comfort me, she says,  His son has some eggnog.  It ignores his name.  But what do I see? 
[01:27:00]  Underneath the tree?  Yeah, my goddess, Miss, calling it beef love.  Just for me.  River!  Miss, calling it beef love, baby.  That's what Christmas is all about.  Everybody, buddy, calling it a beef love, baby.  This little boy, see myself.  Take the heart with boundaries, race, calling it. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now you're a fool.  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with this stupidity.  Mindless.  Crotch grabbing Anthony.  Mindless.  Crotch grabbing Anthony.  People grabbing their crotchets and saying,  Suck it.  Anthony, Anthony, show.  Suck it.  Love the show.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Hey, you're hanging with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:28:00]  Thank you.  Where is the funk soul brother?  Where is our own funk soul brother?  How is he?  Is he okay, Ben?  Yeah, you know, Earl is back to work, Anthony.  Yeah, we never did a recap or get the end of that whole Earl in the hospital in intensive care story.  Earl had bleeding ulcers.  And he was in intensive care.  He lost a whole bunch of blood.  Brought on by you and I, by the way.  Yeah, we didn't know.  They re-pumped him full of the vital vino and now he seems to be fine. 
[01:28:30]  Although, he said it was some kind of bacterial thing.  That ulcers are not caused by his diet or anything like that.  Yet, the new Earl, the Earl that has been given a second lease on life, God only knows why,  has changed his diet.  He's eating like a little bunny rabbit now, isn't he?  Yeah, he gave up all his potato chips to Stinky.  All his 99-cent chips from Dwayne Reed have been given a Stinky.  Earl's big vices, potato chips. 
[01:29:00]  Should you be buying potato chips from Dwayne Reed?  Seriously.  Ugh.  I think the Lord has a purpose for me that I haven't fulfilled yet.  What, does he need a doorstop?  Oh, Jesus.  Earl.  Uh-oh.  Earl, how are you, Earl?  Earl Douglas, here he is.  He's got a bat.  Why is he coming in with a bat?  He's got a Louisville slugger in his hand.  What are you, Giambi?  How are you doing?  What are you, De Niro? 
[01:29:30]  What's up?  How are you doing?  De Niro.  Oh, God.  Stupid limo.  Anthony.  De Niro.  Earl, you're back and better than ever.  Yes.  Shut up.  Now, you have your bleeding ulcers.  They sent a camera down your mouth.  My throat.  And looked at your throat.  Yes.  And, uh...  I'm trying to get the video for that, by the way.  Took a look.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is it as entertaining as the remote control you were on on MTV?  Or it's difficult to find that video?  So they went down inside you, looked at your stomach. 
[01:30:00]  They found the two ulcers.  They found the two ulcers.  Now, they filled you full of blood.  You had lost...  How much blood through these ulcers?  Um, half of it.  Half your blood...  Now, see, this is not on the stand.  You can't live if you lose half.  How do you lose half your blood and you're still walking?  I think you can lose...  They're trying to figure that out.  How did you get to the hospital?  Get a doctor on the phone.  I don't think you can live if you lose half, maybe a third.  How did you get to the hospital?  Where's the point of no return?  Half?  There was a cab stand, like, a block from... 
[01:30:30]  The guy is...  The black guy has only half his blood, and he's getting a cab to the hospital.  I called it.  I called it in.  Oh, then again, at that point, you would look white, so that's definitely a little  lighter, maybe an ashen.  Earl, half your blood's gone, and you're hailing or you're calling cabs.  You wouldn't even...  You'd look at the phone and be like,  It turned into a swan.  You also got to remember, I was out of my...  I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing. 
[01:31:00]  You're talking about your employment here at NEW, or just a past physical problem, yeah?  Where's the Earl tribute?  Earl, so you lost all this blood.  They put you in intensive care, where they then pump you back full of blood.  And they looked at you, but what did they do to help this from happening again?  They put me on medication for a couple of days that basically stops the buildup of acid  and it kills the bacteria. 
[01:31:30]  I mean, but I'm not bleeding anymore.  Now, is your diet changing?  Pretty much, yeah.  Why is that?  I thought it wasn't due to diet, you said.  Well, they told me for a couple of days, lay off any...  Actually, for a couple of weeks, lay off anything acidic like, you know, like Mexican food,  orange juice.  Yeah, Mexican food.  Very acidic.  It's the goddamn Mexicans that did it.  Mexican food, what else?  Anything spicy.  Spicy.  Like, I avoid peppers and... 
[01:32:00]  Uh-oh.  Acidic, spicy, whatever.  Yeah.  Acidic, spicy.  Spicy isn't acidic.  Spicy.  No, he said avoid spicy foods.  What about the acidity?  Is acidity spicy?  That's all I need to know.  Oh, something like it would be bad to have something like...  I can't have caffeine.  ...vinegar or balsamic vinegar on a salad or something.  Yeah, I can't have chocolate.  I can't have coffee.  I can't have the certain...  But I thought it had nothing to do with your diet.  No, they just want to see if, on my own, if any acid will build up. 
[01:32:30]  Did you hear what he had to be on the lookout for, for the days after he got out of the hospital?  What did the doctor tell you to be on the lookout for?  Your black stools.  Black stools.  Gross.  Black stools.  That's the medical term?  Oh.  Black stools.  That was too easy.  Make your own choice.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Have fun with that, people. 
[01:33:00]  Right, yeah.  That's the medical term?  Yeah.  But I'm amazed.  You got yourself back here in record time from intensive care.  Most people in intensive care, like, it's months of some kind of therapy to get back.  All right, well...  He's back.  Thank you, Earl.  Earl, thank you for filling everybody in.  They were so concerned.  I'm glad you're alive.  With your well-being here.  Well, thank you.  Thanks for adding some fine stuff to our program today.  Here's the Earl tribute one last time.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:33:30]  The gang here at the station put this together for our own Earl.  BBC and the wonderful world of Disney present an extraordinary production of the story of Earl Douglas.  Go f*** yourself, okay?  He had survived every format change at WNEW.  I'm the public service director.  But would he survive this tragic ordeal?  Earl, are you okay?  What do you have on your chart?  I have ulcers.  Two of them.  No one knew that a stress-free job could be so deadly. 
[01:34:00]  They took a camera, ran it down my throat, made a wonderful journey through my stomach.  Watch as Earl clings to life in the intensive care unit.  He's not responding.  He's just sitting there kicking his feet.  He looks like he's going to kill somebody.  I guarantee you someone will get injured and it won't be me.  With the public file in disarray, the staff of WNEW tries to cope.  Who's going to sit in the back cubicle and do nothing all day? 
[01:34:30]  Who's going to hang these pictures?  A token black guy.  He's gone.  Who knew Scott Muni would have outlived Earl?  The van showed up for a sticker stop on time.  Wait, Earl's not here?  Hey, look.  CDs.  Watch as Earl faces struggles inside the studio and out.  Earl, I have a question for you.  Is it true that they wanted you to work harder so they're going to do a melanin extraction? 
[01:35:00]  Next question.  Yeah.  If Earl's on the road to recovery, won't he get lost?  Tell me where I'm going.  From ABC television comes the triumphant true story of laziness, mediocrity, virginity, and internal bleeding.  Guess what?  No one cares.  Earl's song.  I love you, Earl Douglas.  Go f*** yourself, okay?  There it is.  Wow.  The tribute to Earl.  Haunting.  I'm not haunting, Earl.  Irish, uh, what is that? 
[01:35:30]  Irish Alky.  Checking him from Jersey.  Saying, did black girl from the future travel to the past to donate blood since he knew black girl from the present would be losing half his blood?  I'd love to hang out here, but I've got to go.  I'm hurting.  I need my own blood.  All right.  What do you want in these veins?  Earl, we would love to abuse you for the next hour, but Mark Burnett is on the hotline, so we're going to go to him now, okay?  If that's all right with you.  Mark Burnett!  How are you doing, guys?  Ah, very good.  The man who created reality TV. 
[01:36:00]  Here he is.  You're on a satellite phone right now?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm actually in the middle of nowhere.  Where are you?  What country are you in?  Actually, the place I'm in is called the Marquesas Islands.  It's about a thousand miles north of Tahiti in the Pacific.  A thousand miles north of Tahiti in the Pacific.  Are you on one of those telephones that they are using over there in Afghanistan? 
[01:36:30]  It sounds like it.  Nothing that important, unfortunately.  But, yeah, that's why the delay.  Sorry about that.  Are you guys filming Survivor 4, or are you just scouting out a location right now?  No, we're right in the middle of filming Survivor 4 right now.  Oh, okay.  Maybe now we can get a couple of tidbits.  How far into filming are you?  We're pretty much in the middle.  We're pretty much well in the middle of it. 
[01:37:00]  Good.  What can we look forward to?  How's the gay guy doing?  Nice try.  Damn it.  Hey, Mark, you know we're big fans of Survivor, right?  We've had you in the studio with all those big-breasted women.  Remember that?  You'll never forget us, right?  Dude, am I ever going to forget that day?  No, you better not.  We've got to be honest.  Survivor 1, loved.  Survivor 2, loved.  With everything that went down September 11th, I have to be honest with you, 
[01:37:30]  I haven't really checked out Survivor 3.  Do you think people will come back to reality programming soon?  Well, you know, for us, we've gone from a phenomenon of 50 million viewers at a finale  to the fact is, you know, our average last year was in the 20s.  We're still at 20 million viewers per week.  I think last week we were number three.  So we've settled down to a very, very high rating, respectable, on the hardest night on TV. 
[01:38:00]  I don't really think it's about reality TV or not reality TV.  It's about quality versus non-quality.  That's why a lot of shows have disappeared.  You know, check out Africa.  It's beautiful and it's good drama and it works.  Yeah, the thing is, I mean, you're kind of competing with, in a way, images of real people  actually surviving huge things that are happening to them.  You know, just the other day, yesterday, a B-1 bomber goes down trying to get to a bombing run 
[01:38:30]  and now there's four guys in the water and, you know, that's Survivor to me, you know.  That's real-life survival.  And before the 11th, you know, Survivor was like, wow, this is cool.  We'll watch these people run through these things and try to win some food for the tribe.  But now it doesn't quite seem as important and I'm wondering if you guys have taken that  into consideration and trying anything to make it, you know, kick it up a notch, as stupid  Emeril says. 
[01:39:00]  You know, I wouldn't do that.  I wouldn't try and kick it up a notch.  I think that, as showed by 20 million viewers a week, people can differentiate between a real  serious wartime or terrorist sort of situation of survival versus a game.  It's only a game.  And, obviously, if our ratings are down to something like many, many network shows in  the 5s and 6s versus us at the 11s and 13s, you know, we're pulling over 20 million viewers  a week.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  They get it.  All right.  You're right.  You're right.  I love that delay.  Oh, this delay is going to kill me.  So, you have any breasts in the audience?  Not today.  Not today.  Tomorrow we're going to have guys hanging around taking leaks all day.  It's our survival.  You know, you guys are just the best stuff.  It's our survivor contest tomorrow.  But if you're halfway...  Just surviving your job, right?  Yeah.  If you're halfway done with the filming right now, is there anything you can give us about  what we can look forward to? 
[01:40:00]  You know, it's a pretty spectacular looking location.  It's like the island of King Kong or like Jurassic Park type look.  It's very, very scenic.  Dinosaurs are running around.  Huge waterfalls.  And there's a lot of ocean stuff, obviously.  They're doing very similar back to...  It's nostalgic, I think is the best thing I can say to you.  It's returning to an island.  Yeah, that kind of worked for you. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, it did.  Any hot girls we can look forward to?  I guarantee you, once you see the cast, there'll be one that you will be calling about and going  to want on your afternoon show.  Perfect.  Mark Burnett.  Perfect.  Now, when does Surviving 4 debut?  Pretty much after the Grammys, at the end of February.  Gotcha.  So you can imagine me right now, between editing Africa, shooting this and then rushing it out. 
[01:41:00]  I don't know if I'm coming or going.  Between telling people to do what?  I don't know if I'm coming or going.  Between editing Africa and shooting and editing this, it's like non-stop.  I hear you.  You're still editing the Africa show?  Personally.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, we've always done that.  We always finish each week's episode that week because the schedule is that tight.  Very good.  All right, Mark.  Well, it's tough to have a conversation this way.  I guess the next time you're in New York, you'll have to stop by. 
[01:41:30]  We'll treat you like a king again.  Well, you certainly treated me like a king last time, so I can't wait.  All right, Mark.  There you go.  Take care, guys.  Somewhere on the globe, I think.  He's 1,000 miles north of Tahiti.  Tahiti.  Mark Burnett, the creator of reality TV.  On some kind of wacky phone.  What, what?  What, Rick?  What's the matter, Rick?  He was telling me on the phone while you guys were talking to Earl that they still had cannibalism on that island.  Oh, they said something about it.  About 100 years ago.  Oh, 100 years ago.  100 years ago. 
[01:42:00]  Jesus Christ, who cares?  Might as well be 1,000 years ago.  Yeah, they still have...  Wow, yeah.  1,000 years ago.  We're going to have flight.  So, basically, my 91-year-old grandma wasn't born yet.  Yeah, you can't even say she might have been eating it from right there.  Just saying.  You know, they're saying 100 years ago, you probably couldn't even get a flight there.  Cannibalism ended nine years before my grandma was born.  Yeah, but, ooh, that's scary. 
[01:42:30]  Ooh, that's shaking me up a little.  I hear back then it was acceptable to bite your sister's can.  Is that true?  Bite a right on the boobie?  A right on the nub?  It was acceptable back then.  Who had the nicest nubs in your family, Rick?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  The most tasty.  The most tasty.  Delicious.  Why are you throwing stuff at me?  I didn't admit that I bit my sister's nub.  Because that's disgusting, you ass.  I didn't admit that I bit my sister's nub.  No, you just look at your dad's junk.  That was when I was eight. 
[01:43:00]  We told the story already in Bronx Zoo, and I just wanted to see what I was going to grow up to be.  Damn from Hoboken.  Is Mark Burnett calling in as Christiane Amanpour guy?  He sounds like it with a delay.  All right, we might have a problem with our contest tomorrow.  What?  Let's see what Jeremy has.  Jeremy, what's up?  Hey, good evening, guys.  Hey.  Have you really thought about this contest?  No.  All right, because you notice when the right-billers flew, they only had one guy there to take a picture in case it did work, 
[01:43:30]  or if it didn't work, no one would really laugh at him.  Because look at the laws of physics.  How much, uh, you ever blow a water balloon up?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  I think he's on to some.  The pressure would be...  You have to overcome the force of a condom, and I don't think there's any human on earth that can spit out that necessary pressure.  I understand what you mean about the pressure and everything, but I think they're stretchy enough. 
[01:44:00]  You know what I mean?  It's not that it's stretchy.  So it is.  The elastic part of a condom is not going to...  Someone get a condom.  We've got to make sure.  I think, uh...  You better make sure this works before you do it, because I don't think you're an X-Box.  I think I'm with Jeremy on this.  I don't think it's going to...  I don't think it's going to expand, man.  You think it'll just overflow and start all up to a certain...  It'll overflow the condom.  You won't get any kind of elasticity to make it expand.  Yeah, because the weight of a full condom full of liquid will not then start stretching the condom out. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, my God.  We might have a problem with our X-Box contest.  All right, Jeremy, we're going to...  Hey, can I say one more thing?  Yeah.  You know, you guys did something the U.S. military couldn't do.  I saw you on CNN that UBL, I guess they call him UBL now, in the threat breeze, that he's going to give up.  He's giving up as of tomorrow because of something about listening to your radio show is so unfunny. 
[01:45:00]  It's just unfunny.  Oh, you again.  Yeah, all right, Jeremy.  Hey, but thanks for the idea.  All right, where'd he go?  And he's listening again.  Did you see he had to...  It was weird because he's talking about something.  He had to make kind of a joke about that we weren't funny.  Like he wanted to be funny on the show and he fell drastically short.  But he made a good point.  He made a good point.  Thank you, Jeremy, for helping out the show.  I don't get the guy.  Does he like us or hates us?  I think he hates us.  He's helping out the show but then saying how unfunny we are. 
[01:45:30]  So, I don't know.  I'm confused by his call, too.  And he called yesterday.  So, if we're unfunny, why is he listening again today?  He can be confused.  I don't know if I like the show or not.  Guy.  All right, well, we're going to get our contestants for the Xbox competition.  We'll figure it out.  We'll do a little science experiment to make sure this is going to work.  If not, we'll have to come up with plan B, Anthony.  Are we going to do that?  Let's see.  Rick, give me that.  Oh, my God.  You want me to try it?  No.  Well, not...  Give it to me.  You don't have to do it with water.  Yeah, we can just do it with water. 
[01:46:00]  I just want to say...  I think the guy might be right.  He might have a point where not funny.  No, he might have...  He might have a point.  We will slowly fill this up.  All right.  And you've got to see if the weight of just this much liquid is going to stress.  Say, I think he might have a point.  Even though, you know, he hates us, he might have helped the show today.  He might have a hole in the pinch.  Man, how long does the pinch and unroll that damn thing?  Let's go.  Well...  Okay, usually it's on... 
[01:46:30]  I heard you.  Yeah, I know you heard me.  All right, let's go to the people on hold.  Let's go.  All right.  You need water?  There we go.  Here's water.  Okay.  Don't pour...  I won't.  Here, here.  It's got to be...  Rick, grab the water.  Pour it in slowly, Rick.  Yeah.  Because that'll make a difference, too.  Pour the water in...  Very slowly.  Not...  We're doing an experiment.  All right.  All right.  Oh, no.  There we go.  Hold on.  Let's see.  Oh, we're effed.  Let's see.  Hold it.  We're effed.  Keep going.  All the way to the top. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Keep going.  Oh, boy.  We're screwed.  That ain't expanding, man.  Yeah, there it goes.  No, it's going to go over the top.  No, thanks, Rick.  No, I can't move.  What do you mean?  I can't move.  I can't move.  I can't move my fingers.  Pull the receptacle tip down.  Ah!  All right.  Will you throw that?  Okay. 
[01:47:30]  Throw it away.  No, no, no.  Let's throw it at John.  Throw it away.  All right.  Well, we need a plan B, ladies and gentlemen.  We're going to have to figure out how to do this.  Well.  It didn't break.  That's pretty good.  Let's go to the FU line.  I got a couple ideas, and we'll figure it out next, and we'll get some contestants as well, okay?  Right.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  A huge throbbing FU to the little bitch that was riding in the red Dutch south on the Taconic 
[01:48:00]  Parkway this morning.  Yeah, it's me in the whiteboard focus who was waving to you.  I was not trying to pick you up, you uppity bitch.  Your brake lights were out.  I'm trying to.  You're waving me off.  I'm trying to let you know.  You know what?  Don't flatter yourself.  F*** you.  My wife makes you look like a man.  Next message.  I just want to give a big FU to the two floors of Cleveland told you to go back to Africa.  Well, why don't you go to your trailer park, you idiot, stupid piece of white trash. 
[01:48:30]  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big F*** you out to myself for having 12 beers and then driving  the wrong way down a one-way road and getting a TWI and losing my license for six months.  Now my stupid F*** man is just to walk around town the next six months like a big F*** loser.  WNEW.  Disturbed again.  This is the Opian Anthony Show.  We might have a problem with our Xbox competition, Anthony.  Why is that now? 
[01:49:00]  Well, we came up with this great idea where guys would come down here and fill up a condom  with their own you-know-what.  Yeah, they would have to relieve themselves.  Right, and well, turns out that's impossible to do.  Well, we just took a condom, slowly poured some water into it.  The condom fills up and would overflow before the weight of the liquid in it would stretch  it out to make more room for more liquid. 
[01:49:30]  You know what I mean?  It just kind of fills up.  And then Rick had to make sure so he went into the bathroom and tried it.  Yeah, what did you do?  Disgusting.  Did you, you, you, what?  You, you, you hit it?  Yeah.  What did it do?  It did exactly what we thought it was going to do.  But you had to hold it.  First of all, you got to hold it on because you need to be happy for that.  I understand, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then what happened? 
[01:50:00]  It just kind of filled up.  And then came pouring out the sides?  You got to let it go.  Jesus.  Now what are we going to do?  We're screwed.  I got one more idea.  We suck.  You have another idea.  What's that?  Oh, he's doing an experiment.  All right, Keith, what's going on?  Well, Tennessee, first you've got to take the balloon and stretch it out and fill it with liquid  so it doesn't burst in, whoo-hoo-pee, you'll have a contest.  Keith? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Hey, man.  You guys aren't effed, all right?  Here's what you need.  There's a product called a Texas catheter.  It's just like a condom.  It was made for, well, not the contest you guys are running, but it was made for some people  who have urinary problems.  It goes all to the end of your junk, and that's exactly what it'll do.  It'll expand and fill up.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Just go down to any medical supply store, and they should have them right there on the  shelf.  How much does that go for?  Because they're cheap.  It's been a long time since I was in the business, but they're pretty cheap. 
[01:51:00]  You know?  Someone suggested we blow up the condom to stretch it out.  You know how sometimes when you make a balloon animal, the guy stretches out the condom?  All right, get another condom.  All right.  Hold on, Keith.  Anthony, throw me one of those.  That's the experiment I'm doing.  Oh, that's the experiment you're doing?  Yeah.  What did you do?  Did you blow that up already?  I'm stretching it out.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Give me a condom.  Give it.  Oh, my God.  Give me a goddamn condom. 
[01:51:30]  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  See, he's stretching it as he pours the water in.  No, no, no, no.  Dan, what's up?  He's a lubricated.  Give me a dry one.  What?  Yeah, Dan, what's up?  God damn.  Hey, man, I work for FreeCondoms.com, so all I do all day...  Hey!  Curse during a story, guy.  All right.  So you work for FreeCondoms...  FreeCondoms.com.  You got it working.  What?  Rick's got it working? 
[01:52:00]  That should pour more liquid.  It keeps dragging it out.  Oh, it is.  Give me more.  All right, hold on.  We might be on to something here, Dan.  Oh, I'm a long-time listener, too.  All right, well, do you have any tips for this contest we're trying to do?  The best one that we have is that you could take the Ultra-Condoms.  Hold on, Rick.  Hold on, Dan.  But no one has that force when they're doing their thing.  You got to...  I'm just...  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, pour it in.  I think it matters. 
[01:52:30]  Try this, Rick.  It matters, Dan, because if you had a fire hose, of course it's going to stress.  Weight is weight.  Weight is weight.  Just keep pouring.  See?  There's a problem.  Hold on.  Keep pouring.  Yeah, that's good.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Stop it.  Weight is weight.  We learned that.  Weight is weight.  Weight is weight.  But how much water now?  Let's keep going.  Get more water.  Let's see when it bursts.  Well, do it over that garbage pail with that one. 
[01:53:00]  Now, the guys, they would be allowed to hold the bottom of the condom,  because obviously it's going to break sooner if you just let it stretch like that.  Right?  I don't know.  Do we need Dan still on line three?  I don't think so.  Dan, any tips?  You could stretch out the condom beforehand.  I mean, we got ultra comfort to fit over an entire village voice.  No, I know.  Howie Mandel, he put a condom over his whole body, didn't he?  Yeah.  I thought that was a surgical glove. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, whatever.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  All right.  Now, the ultimate test, Rick should try the...  He should try it out in the bathroom doing the real thing now.  Feels like a boobie.  All right, Rick.  Now, do it over the garbage pail and hold the bottom of it.  I don't have to anymore.  No, no.  All right, hold on.  Now we got another problem.  Now the contest is going to get very gay,  because it's obvious that you need both hands to hold the opening of the condom.  Now, how are you going to do the deed? 
[01:54:00]  You hold it in...  You hold it around...  You hold it around your junk.  You hold it around your junk.  With one hand.  Right.  Stretch...  Well, I guess this is part of the competition.  Well, the guys have to figure all this out, right?  They've got to figure it out.  All right.  If some guy loses some before he figures it out, that's his problem.  So you think this is just a stupid little contest,  but there's a lot of strategy involved.  Hold on.  Yeah, go ahead.  Rick, you're going to have to take one hand,  hold one side of that where John is holding it.  Why doesn't John make...  And then John's going to have to hold the bottom,  because the guy is going to have it around his junk.  He's going to be holding with one hand, 
[01:54:30]  and he's going to be supporting it with the other hand,  so it doesn't just fall down and rip.  But don't we want it to hang to see if it doesn't break?  No.  No, these guys will...  It's up to them what they want to do.  If they want to let it hang and hope it doesn't break, fine.  But I have a feeling some of the guys are going to want to hold the bottom.  Don't worry.  See?  Hold the bottom, then.  Yeah, Rick, hold the bottom.  There you go.  Now, this is where the other problem comes in,  because now I think it's not going to work anymore.  No, because he keeps letting it go down.  It should.  There's got to get... 
[01:55:00]  This is fantastic.  It's working.  It's working.  It's working.  All right, but how much?  These guys are going to be...  Pour the whole goddamn thing in.  These guys are going to be relieving themselves for three and a half hours.  Well, we'll kind of get a little...  We'll get a line on how much it can take.  Is there two bottles where maybe Rachel can be filling one to get another one?  Someone's going to leak that much?  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  Wow.  That's...  They're going to need more than one condom.  Yeah.  No.  They only get one condom.  They get one.  They need the brakes, or they strategically stop after a while, or whatever.  A lot of people are trying this at home, Anthony.  Are they?  Is it working?  They like it works.  They, like ourselves, don't have lives.  I think it...  We're pathetic.  I think it's going to work.  It's going to work.  You really think it's going to work?  I think it's going to work.  Yeah.  As long as we stretch them out beforehand, and then let them...  You know what? 
[01:56:00]  What?  But it's up to the contestants.  We'll just give them the condom and let them go.  It's up to them to stretch it.  They've got to figure out, right, exactly how it's going to work.  If they stretch too much, and they pop a hole in it...  They only get one?  Well, then they've got a problem.  Uh-oh.  Then it's going to be like that damn trick.  They're going to have to be plugging a hole with this in.  They've got all sorts of problems at that point.  Right?  Yes.  Hey, Stinky, do we have our contestants?  You don't have to pour slow.  Just pour.  Screw it.  I don't think the gravity matters, does it? 
[01:56:30]  It should pour under your hand.  Keep going.  There you go.  Wow.  It's just filling out the size.  This is great.  Because I want to see if it reaches a point where...  That thing will get it.  Dude, that is going to make such a mess if it breaks.  Keep it over the goddamn thing.  Let me see how big it is.  Look how big it is.  It looks like a beaker.  It's like a big beaker.  All right.  It'll get a lot bigger than that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  And it's so dangerous to even just have. 
[01:57:00]  Like, the guys are going to be freaking.  Are we going to have a kiddie pool or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hell, yeah.  We can't have that all over the place.  All right.  Get Stinky in here.  I want to see where we're at with our contestants.  We're going to have a contestant from every city, hopefully, that we broadcast in.  You're like, well, how is that possible?  Well, a lot of people are in New York for many different reasons.  And they just proved that they're from one of the cities we broadcast in.  And they're in on the competition.  Stink, what do we got so far?  We're not doing that great.  We got a Boston guy.  All right.  Boston representing.  Good. 
[01:57:30]  South Jersey, which is the Philly station.  Why is Philly?  All right, Philly.  Go ahead.  And then Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, the Bronx.  All the boroughs are represented.  Well, we are.  You know, we can't play faves.  We've got to pick one New York guy to represent us.  Oh, God.  That's huge.  The home station.  You know what, though?  We'll have the other guys come down just in case.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I hate to pick one New York guy, and he's the only guy that shows up.  All right.  So if you want in on this contest, the person that could fill up their condom the most in 
[01:58:00]  three and a half hours will win the Xbox.  A lot of strategy involved.  Dude, this is working great.  Look at this.  Look how ridiculous this thing has got.  Look at the size of it.  Yeah.  But you're sure that doesn't matter how fast it comes out of the bottle?  No.  All right.  Because after the weight starts to go, it's all about the bottle.  The only time pressure would matter is if it was sealed between the bottle and the top  part of the condom.  I hated science. 
[01:58:30]  That is really big.  That's a lot of...  And, yeah.  That's as big as a melon head.  Dude, put it this way.  We can't keep doing this until it breaks, because now it's reached the point where it's really  going to make a huge mess.  But that's not going to break anytime soon, I'm telling you.  How do you know?  Out of curiosity, I want to see how much we can do.  Well, then you know something?  Go to the sink in the bathroom.  Put that in the bottom of the sink.  Oh, my God.  You're losing some.  Oh, I'm losing some.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Rachel, grab the bottle.  It's slipping through there.  It's like handling... 
[01:59:00]  Anthony, it's like handling mercury.  Yeah.  It's like they got liquid metal in their hands.  Rick, go to the bathroom with that.  No, I want to see him do it right in here, man.  It's going to pop.  He's holding it with one hand now.  This is really going to be bad.  He's going to lose it.  But the guys are going to have to do all this by themselves.  I mean, they're a tag team here.  The thing is, the one hand that they have is going to be around their junk and the rubber,  keeping it sealed and held up.  The other hand is going to be underneath the bottom of it to cradle it and hold the weight. 
[01:59:30]  No one's going to have to hold the bottle because that's attached to his body.  Right.  Can we set up...  Dude, look how big it is.  Hold that up, Rick.  Can we set up a low-lying table that they can set their condom on?  No, because you know something?  It makes it more dangerous and a lot more fun if they have to handle it themselves.  Because if they drop it, that's their problem.  You know?  All right.  It looks like it's going to work after all.  I wish I had a pellet gun right now. 
[02:00:00]  I would shoot that thing.  Go all over the gun.  They are just pouring water like crazy now.  Rick is now up to two hands.  It's as big as a basketball.  Rick, you know something?  Rick, you should hold it with one hand because that's all they're going to be able to do.  Yeah.  Hold it with one hand.  Rachel pouring it in now.  John holding it.  John, John, where are you going?  Hold the towel.  So this is going to be a lot of strategy.  This isn't just a stupid contest.  No.  Well, it is.  Don't get carried away. 
[02:00:30]  Slow down.  We walked into a gold mine here, though.  Yeah, but now it is.  It's a strategy on how they hold it, how much they put in.  Because some guy might say, look, I can hold it.  I'm going to stop.  Because I know damn well the next guy, even if he gets more in there, is not going to be able to hold it.  Right.  It's going to fall off and break.  You've got to also, your arms get tired, too.  Your arms get tired.  And put it this way.  If that slips out of your one hand, the hand that you have grabbed around your junk with,  you're not going to be able to hold on to it. 
[02:01:00]  It's going to slip off, hit the pool, and go all over the place like a water wheelie.  And Mark Burnett, I think we have something for Survivor 4.  Yeah.  And then at that point, they could grab another condom.  They'll just be way behind.  They'll be way down.  Right.  All right.  Well.  All right.  Look, look, look.  I think we walked into a brilliant idea, Anthony.  Yes.  At this point, I think we've got about six liters in here.  Let me say how.  It's huge.  Hold it up.  Hold it up.  Look.  Our listeners don't know liters.  It's as big as like a volleyball.  Yeah, that's like a volleyball right now. 
[02:01:30]  Filled with water.  It's cold.  That's, well, yeah.  It's warm.  Does it feel like a big boob?  Yeah, it does.  It feels like a big implant.  Let me cop a feel off of that.  Let me say.  Whoa, it does.  A big, one on a cold hooker.  And you just.  A cold dead hooker.  You just felt that?  Yeah.  It could go a lot bigger, right?  Yeah, it's still very pliable.  Yeah, that's not even close to it.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, put it on a surface that is not even near the garbage bin.  You know what?  I think the guy should be allowed a surface, Anthony. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know.  It takes the element of you've got to be careful holding it at it.  Well, when we show prep tomorrow, we'll work out the bugs.  How's that?  Oh, we will?  Yeah, yeah.  What time is that?  2.59 we'll meet?  Why don't you come in a little early tomorrow?  2.45, Anthony.  All right.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to be a contestant.  Did you sign up?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, then you're a contestant, I guess.  All right, cool.  They told me to hold on.  What city will you be representing?  If he doesn't know, he's a contestant guy.  Northern Jersey.  Northern Jersey.  Northern Jersey? 
[02:02:30]  Yep.  All right.  Well, you're going to be representing Jersey then.  All right, cool.  Okay.  All right.  Kevin, we'll see you tomorrow.  All right, bye.  You guys are such fags.  Anything to get a look at man's junk for hours?  We're not going to be looking at the man's junk.  What?  They'll be outside the studio.  Rick will be looking at the man's junk.  Right, junk.  Pick it up, pick it up.  Pick it up.  What's the matter?  It's cold.  Uh-oh, John's fingers are digging into the side of it.  It's going to go.  It's going to go.  Look at his fingers.  They're digging into the side.  Don't do that.  Dude, he was holding it like this, like claws. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  How about they have to rest it on Stalker Patty's feet?  There's an element of danger.  What's up?  Rip it open.  I got to tip for all the future contestants.  Yeah.  These guys are smart.  They'll use both hands to hold the condom on top of their junk and just get down on their knees  and let the condom fill up and sit on the floor.  I think that's fair, Ann.  Well, you know something?  Anything on their body is fair.  I think that's how we've got to work this.  If they want to lay on their back and somehow have it in their lap as they're doing it, that's fine. 
[02:03:30]  You need gravity somehow.  If they want to crouch and put it on their knees, like he says, and hold it that way, that's fine, too.  But it has to be on their person.  So they can't use a surface or the floor.  No, I don't like the idea of being able to use a surface.  It takes the element of danger.  Look at the size of it.  What about if they use Gay Marco and just teabag him with the condom?  We don't even know if Gay Marco's alive.  We haven't heard from him in months.  All right, guys.  Is he calling another radio show or something?  Might have the ninja.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:04:00]  Bye.  That is giant.  It is now the size of a duck.  Yeah.  We're still trying to get the contestants, Anthony.  This is going to work.  Tomorrow you come in.  Right at 3, you start doing what you have to do.  So you can even start your water drinking, whatever you're going to drink, before the show.  Oh, yeah.  And really hold it in so you get off to a great start right at 3 o'clock.  All right.  Stinky, how many contestants do we have? 
[02:04:30]  Here comes Stinky.  I'm confused.  Do we want to isolate that right away?  That is the best I'm confused I ever heard out of you.  It's really easy.  We just want a contestant from every city we broadcast.  Only people from New York are calling out.  Right.  Well, you know what you can do?  Well, but there's people that are...  Why don't you just nominate whoever comes in to be a representative for a city?  Well, it would be nicer if they were actually from the city.  You mean to tell me that people aren't listening to our show that are in New York. 
[02:05:00]  Maybe you're vacationing.  Right.  Or at school.  Right.  Anybody?  At school.  Not yet.  Anyone that's in New York that is from one of the cities that we broadcast to,  come on in.  You listen to the stupid show when you're on vacation?  What do you mean the stupid show?  I do.  I listen to Stinky's Fisher songs that he puts on.  I love this stupid show.  All right.  Well, what do you want to do?  You want to just get ten contestants then?  Yeah.  We're going to have to.  I was trying to involve everybody.  See what you get for that? 
[02:05:30]  Nothing.  Oh, my God.  That is gigantic.  How many contestants you got?  Three, five, seven, nine.  Nine?  All right.  We'll get like three more contestants.  That is not going to break.  All right.  There goes Stinky.  That is not going to break.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not going to break for a while.  So that's why we need the element of them dropping it at an end.  All right.  You know?  Look at that thing.  Glug, glug, glug.  Wow.  Let me see how big it is now.  There's another one.  Lift it up.  It's giant big.  Lift it up.  John is having trouble lifting it.  It's like one of those mini hippity hops now. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  It's very big.  It is like a big goose.  You're going to drop it.  It's going.  I'm definitely going to drop it.  It's going.  Look at it.  John's going to drop it.  Oh, no.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  John.  Hold it.  Look at his watch band going into it.  Oh, my God.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Oh, my God.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Oh, my God.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  You're such an idiot, man.  What a jerk.  God, you're the best, man.  You're just broke all over, John.  He's so... 
[02:06:30]  Why wouldn't you put it down?  I was trying to.  Get that sopped up with something.  Oh, my God.  It's all over the place.  I knew when I saw it, he's trying to hold it, and his hands are shaking, and it hit his  watch band.  The second it hit the bottom part, the clasp part of his watch band, I'm like, oh, my God,  it's over.  And it just exploded when all over him got Rick, and the floor is soaked.  Yeah, well, as far as liquids go, that's pretty much the most harmless fluid we've had on 
[02:07:00]  these condoms.  Thank God.  Yeah.  Actually, we're cleaning the whole place with that.  There you go.  All right.  All over the place.  That is a lot of water.  You know what's under these floors, by the way?  Nothing.  Huh?  Lots of wires?  Right.  This is an elevated floor.  If you lift up these tiles, you will see wires galore running between, I don't understand.  Other shows don't do this.  How I have to crawl under the floor with towels and dry each wire individually, and it cuts 
[02:07:30]  into my coffee maker maintenance schedule.  Never had to do this when they were playing classic rock here.  That's pretty well.  Sometimes Scottson would wet himself, but never that much.  Never that much.  All right.  Xbox competition on for tomorrow.  We're getting our contestants.  You come down, and you have three and a half hours to fill up the condom as much as you  can, okay?  And see what could happen.  We will provide water if you're of age, beer, whatever.  I highly recommend if the contestants are listening that you start your fluid intake before the 
[02:08:00]  show to get a head start.  Start it early, yeah.  Because right at three, you can let it loose, so to speak.  6.30, we'll announce the winner of the Xbox.  Rock!  Can't wait.  And I think this is going to be a lot of fun to check out.  Because there's, like we said, a lot of strategy involved.  Strategies.  You know what?  Number one, you watch tomorrow, they're going to be taking their goddamn watches off just  from what they learned right here.  Right.  The second I saw it hit your watch, man, I'm like, it's over, man.  It's just metal digging into thin latex rubber.  Over. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  Now he's soaked.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  You're rocking with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Giving away that Xbox tomorrow.  Our last one, Anthony.  Yeah.  We just tried out the condoms.  The condom contest is on.  Sounds silly, but I'm telling you, a lot of strategy involved.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  We'll take pictures.  We'll have fun.  Brian Regan coming in tomorrow as well with his brother. 
[02:09:00]  Dennis, I think his name is, right?  Dennis Regan?  Brian and Dennis playing Caroline's this weekend.  We highly recommend you go.  Tickets go really fast when Brian comes to town.  So I'm going to that one, that's for sure.  And we haven't had him on the show in a while.  Last time he was through the area, he was really, really sick with the flu.  So I can't come in.  I got the flu bug.  He's going to enjoy tomorrow's contest, isn't he?  It's Brian Regan with the flu in it.  A couple quick phone calls and then we'll move on to other things here. 
[02:09:30]  Elizabeth, what's up?  Hey, you guys.  I'm a nurse and I just thought I'd let you know there's this thing available.  I don't know if it helps your contest or not.  It's called a Texas catheter.  It's a condom with a catheter attached to it.  We use it on a lot of old guys in nursing homes.  And it basically just sits on their junk and they go and fill up the catheter.  And that's how you measure what they...  Are you trying to be deja vu, lady?  Why?  Someone else called in with that.  The Texas catheter. 
[02:10:00]  But basically you're saying it would make it a lot easier.  We don't like anything easy on this show.  Well, it still can fall off.  It depends on how they fill up the catheter.  Yeah.  No, the condom thing is going to work perfectly.  Okay.  We're very excited.  Thank you.  Yeehaw.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to Jason who's from Ireland, Anthony.  Jason?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I can come down tomorrow for the competition, yeah?  Of course.  I do believe you'll be drinking beer, right?  Oh, yeah.  I hope so.  What's that, Adam?  No, let me tell you.  We've just got a lot of Guinness. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, we got a...  Didn't Guinness just give us a bunch of...  Guinness just gave us a shipment, sir.  Guinness sucks over here.  Where?  Over here in America.  You've got to drink Guinness back home in Ireland.  No.  We love the Guinness.  Why?  What's the difference in Ireland?  It's warm, right?  No.  Why do people always say that?  Oh, stop it.  All right.  I'll give it a try anyways.  I'll drink whatever comes to hand.  We'll see what happens.  You don't like the tap Guinness over here?  No, bro.  It's actually...  It's warmer over here than what it is in Ireland.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  People just have that whole thing about saying that Irish people like their Guinness warm.  That's all BS, if you ask me.  Really?  Definitely.  I guess you don't like fighting either, right?  Definitely not.  Listen, I'm going to go practice, guys.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  You cool?  Good luck.  All right.  I didn't say nothing.  Hey!  I didn't say anything.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love your show.  Thanks, Mark.  Up in Boston.  Glad to have you back.  Well, thank you.  Look at the contest.  You guys need to get some strippers down there. 
[02:11:30]  Make it a little harder for the guys to juggle the...  Not that you want to see wood and junk or anything, but...  Should we have strippers?  They can really throw off the contest.  They may add a little...  We can all figure out who's gay.  Hey, on the Xbox, but you're the gay guy.  You're the gay guy that didn't have anything going on.  I don't know why it's that way.  Funny, but...  They'll get their stripper smell all over everything.  You know, that's a good excuse to call a privileged gentleman's club and get some of the ladies down here. 
[02:12:00]  Sure, why not?  Privileged has great strippers.  You know what?  It'll take the gayness out of the contest.  So, Mark, thank you for saving our asses.  No problem.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Do that.  Book that, Rick.  Yeah, because we're getting a lot of complaints that it's a very gay contest.  So, that'll take the gayness out of it, all right?  Mm-hmm.  So, we'll have Ireland represented.  Here's a guy, Lou, from Buffalo.  Hey, guys, I go to school at Buffalo.  I'm flying into New York tomorrow.  I'll be there at 1230.  Can I come in and be the Buffalo contestant? 
[02:12:30]  Email me back or call my cell phone.  Let's call this guy.  Yeah.  If he gets here by three, he'll represent Buffalo, all right?  I don't know how he's going to...  If he gets in by 1230, taxi from the airport, yeah, he might make it, right?  Easily.  Easily?  Easily.  Have you been driving around out there, Ben?  Huh?  What?  No, I have.  All right.  Sean from Middletown says, hey, I got an instant feedback for you every minute you guys say  something on the show, and he wants to be Dan the Hoboken guy. 
[02:13:00]  Here's what we're doing here.  All right, Sean.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, what's going on?  I guess I'm in the contest.  I'm representing Delaware.  Cool.  Delaware.  Yes.  All right.  I don't know.  I just want to thank Mark because the idea with the strippers definitely made the contest  a whole lot better.  Yeah, because you were a little worried to stand around in a kiddie pool with other guys.  Yeah, the whole idea of me standing around in a kiddie pool with a bunch of guys holding  the junk didn't sound too appealing.  Dave, I'll tell you, though, when you get down here, we will set it up in a way where  you'll feel very comfortable, and you'll be like, okay, I can do this. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, it doesn't even matter.  We're not putting the guys in the kiddie pool next to each other, man.  No.  You sick F.  Well, let's get the blue tarp out.  Dude, the blue tarp is not going to do anything.  Sure will.  I don't know.  Who's going to clean it up?  Hold on, Rick.  I'm thinking of the worst-case scenario.  A few explosions happen.  Hold on.  Who's going to clean that up?  I will go with this.  Rick, you really think we're going to have about 12 guys? 
[02:14:00]  They're all going to stand around next to each other in a kiddie pool.  Like a circle jerk.  Without their pants on.  We've got two kiddie pools.  You really think they'll do that?  What else are they going to do?  I don't think they're going to have their pants down.  They can just hang it out.  Oh, sort of.  You would think they'd have to have them down because they don't want to splatter on them.  Oh, Rick, in your dreams, they all do, I'm sure.  No, no, no, Dave.  All right, Dave, we'll see you tomorrow.  We'll figure it all out.  I'm telling you.  All right, guys.  All right, we'll figure it out.  All right, take it easy. 
[02:14:30]  You better get a lot of, let's just put it this way, you better get a lot of kiddie pools.  Hey, Kev.  I'll tell you something.  I'll tell you something.  The way that balloon popped and left water over here, there's no way that can happen with  what's going to be filling that up.  But we definitely have to get the big, huge blue tarp.  We get the blue tarp.  Because at least we can mop it up if we have to.  Mop it up.  See, this is how we show prep.  We do it right on the air for a minute.  Yeah, we're just talking about we'll hash it out right here on the air.  Right on the air, man.  So you know the problems we face.  Ah, John, what's up? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, what's up?  I'm bringing a mop.  Where are you from?  I'm from New York.  And now I'm living in San Francisco for the last five years.  Oh, yeah?  So I consider myself a Californian.  All right, so you're going to be representing California?  Absolutely.  All right, cool.  All right, buddy?  All right.  You'll represent San Francisco and Sacramento for us.  Yeah, well, whatever I got to do, I'm going to bring a mop.  Okay?  All right, buddy.  Does he really sign up, that guy? 
[02:15:30]  Stinky high today?  Hey, Kev.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  You guys need something?  Wow.  Kitty pools.  I'm the guy who wants to provide stuff for the show guy.  What do we need?  Kitty pools?  Kitty pools.  How are we going to get a kitty pool?  Oh, inflatable kitty pool.  Inflatable kitty pool.  Yeah, I should be able to come up with that.  He's gotten a few of those before.  He said pool.  We need pools.  I just said pools.  What do we need?  Two?  But he said pool.  Three?  At least.  How many do you need?  I think we need three.  By when? 
[02:16:00]  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Okay, it shouldn't be a problem.  All right, thank you.  I'll call you later, Rick.  Thanks.  All right.  There goes Big Kev.  Three kitty pools.  Hey, what's going on, bro?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What do you think of your Nintendo GameCube?  We're not even talking about games right now.  Oh, allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a call of the show totally off-topic guy.  Fuck. 
[02:16:30]  Goddamn, you got me.  I'm Luigi this year.  Son of a bitch got me.  You got us, all right?  GameCube is going to be the one that fades away.  That's the one that is not going to last.  How do you think about it, though?  I have nothing.  I don't care, off-topic guy.  I'm PlayStation 2 guy.  So we're talking about the contest tomorrow.  You don't call up with a GameCube comment.  Contest?  But, man, Xbox is advertising like crazy.  You're ruining the guy's bit because now he's on topic. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, true.  Sorry.  I'm going to Texas to listen to myself, guys.  All right, bye.  Dick.  That's possible, though.  Of course it is.  All right.  Steve just handed me something.  Yeah.  Homeless for the holidays, the CD?  Oh, right, right.  With them singing.  Yeah, the homeless guys?  Yeah.  It's done, and you guys can buy it and stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  Somehow I don't think this is going to be a real commercial.  So we got a commercial for Homeless for the Holidays, Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  Check it out.  You've heard them go shopping on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now hear them sing.  K-Smell Records and the Salvation Army present Homeless for the Holidays.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, what fun it is to ride on a goddamn step lady.  Spend Christmas with your favorite homeless lunatics.  You'll hear all the classics.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. 
[02:18:00]  Had a very shiny nose.  Just like yours.  Deck the halls.  And who could forget Ziggy's haunting rendition of Silent Night?  Night, night, holy night.  And if you call within the next ten seconds, we'll throw in as an added bonus,  the making of Homeless for the Holidays, featuring never-before-heard homeless outtakes. 
[02:18:30]  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head.  Shoot all these motherfuckers.  Let me off.  Let me off.  Let me off.  Off-key, out of time, and smells horrible, it's Homeless for the Holidays.  Get yours today.  Call 1-800-HEP-A-TITUS.  Well, that's me off.  Bravo.  Wow.  I gotta ask you.  I heard them sing, what was the first song? 
[02:19:00]  Jingle Bells.  Jingle Bells.  Yeah.  And there was no music behind them.  And now on that, it's them singing it, and there's music behind it.  I had to download about ten different versions of Jingle Bells,  and I found one that I could tinker with the audio enough so that it sounded like they were actually singing.  It sounded like they were singing to that music.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  That's the key.  That's why it took me seven hours to do it.  Ben, do we actually have bits on our show again?  I don't know.  I hope not.  Are we going to start having bits on our show?  This is the third one in the last week, I think. 
[02:19:30]  I know.  Maybe.  Did someone tell you to make bits for our show?  No.  No, just a whim.  It was inspiring.  Steve's really like that.  My favorite that you made is the, where's the special message from our general manager?  I love it.  Yes.  I know we're playing it a lot, but this really is our boss, Ken Stevens.  It's all about Christmas.  He's had a really tough year, and he just wanted to give a special holiday message to Aunt and I and our listeners.  And now, a holiday message from Opie and Anthony Joe general manager, Ken Stevens. 
[02:20:00]  I don't care no more.  I don't care.  Hey, my life is over.  I will kill anyone.  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head.  Shoot all these motherfuckers.  And I'll shoot myself.  I'm trying to tell you not.  Happy Holidays from all of us at the Opie and Anthony Joe.  I love that one.  Very good, Steve.  Steve from foundrymusic.com. 
[02:20:30]  It did seem like Ken also turned up in the homeless for the holiday CD.  Well, maybe.  Tell us what's going on.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Where are you?  I got an easy solution for you.  Okay.  You just have each guy stand in a trash bag.  Do you have any breakings, any droppings, no cleanup?  Yeah, they could stand in a...  Each guy can have a trash bag as well, and if they know something's going to happen, then  we could have, like, spotters lift the bag up real fast.  Hey, that's good. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, you get them all in and have to deal with that.  It's really not a bad idea.  How about you have garbage pails for each one?  Who's going to hold the bag, though?  No, I mean, you have big, those green garbage pails.  You have a garbage pail?  And I'm going to stand right in them.  Oh, man.  Takes the scariness out of it.  I like the risk factor there.  You, maybe.  That there could be, you know what, all over the place.  As long as it's going to be wrinkling it up.  For the people in the kiddie pool there, you know, if there's a couple of guys in there,  they've got to worry that one guy's going to drop it, and they're going to get his...  Oh, my God. 
[02:21:30]  ...other wing all over their feet and legs.  I'm telling you, there's so much strategy involved in this stupid contest, because then  what do you do?  I think we need 20 strippers in here tomorrow.  Then what do you do if one guy is out of the contest, he drops his thing in the kiddie pool,  it's all over the place.  Now you have to decide if you want to stand in someone else's you-know-what.  But how bad do you want that Xbox?  Exactly.  I like it.  People are wondering, Rick, when you were holding the condom full of water, did it feel  like any of your sisters?  Yeah, I felt like I'm fighting it, okay?  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:22:00]  Hey.  Hey, I thought our big cat was bring bad guests into the studio, guys.  Or on the phone.  Well, he's trying to change his character, obviously.  All right.  Good for him.  All right.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  Bye.  Hey, you're talking about the guy that delivered the guy that was in the Lost in Space robot  suit.  Not the voice.  The guy that was in the suit.  Probably the best guest we've ever had on this show.  Oh.  And Dr. Smith, right?  Yep.  Joe, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, I'm an incredibly boring guy.  How about your turn down the goddamn radio guy first, you tool? 
[02:22:30]  I'm the guy that's going to turn down the radio because I'm the head-shaking news guy.  What is he talking about?  I don't know, man.  Unbelievably true head-shaking news guy.  Unbelievably true.  The stories that you just hear them and you just shake your head and say, I don't believe  it.  So, you're the unbelievably true head-shaking news guy?  Yep.  I don't think that character's really going to take off.  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:00]  You guys are going to wreck our bit, sir?  You're going to wreck our bit?  Yeah.  I don't think.  We need this bit to last another day or two.  He's ruined the bit guy.  He's ruined the bit guy.  He just was.  No.  I heard him.  No.  You did, too.  No.  Let's go to Peter.  Peter, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I have a great story for you.  Oh, cool.  I was playing on a GTA 3 with my girlfriend, right?  Yeah.  I saw this car on the screen and everything.  Yeah.  And so, I get out of my car and then I...  Hello? 
[02:23:30]  Peter.  Peter, what happened?  We need to know the end of the story.  Peter?  Is he disconnected in the middle of the story?  Yeah, I think you...  Yeah.  Yeah, that was it.  But you're still connected.  You're supposed to hang up, I would think.  You have to have confidence in your bit.  It's ruined the bit guy, too.  You just ruined your own bit.  I tried.  He wanted to stay on the phone and he didn't want to make that supreme sacrifice.  We don't vote for an hour. 
[02:24:00]  Boy, you don't want to hang up right then.  All right.  I'll give him that.  We should have.  I mean, every day we do have that guy.  I've been on hold for two and a half hours, guy.  And I have nothing to say.  Anthony, a few other things.  Yeah, Yank's got Giambi.  Giambi, yeah.  Well, we reported that weeks ago.  That's old news for us, right?  That's old news.  We reported it weeks ago.  George Steinbrenner, you know, he bought...  How much?  $119 million.  $119 mil? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  That's relatively cheap.  And we stole Alomar from Cleveland.  Sorry, guys.  I think we got the better part of that deal, didn't we?  Alomar going to the Mets.  What did we give up?  Like a janitor and a hot dog guy?  Does Cleveland want to even have a baseball team?  So, and then there's breaking news about Winona Ryder.  Winona Ryder, it seems.  I don't know why people like Winona and other celebrities that get in this type of trouble have to do this. 
[02:25:00]  Maybe it's a sickness.  Actress Winona Ryder arrested for shoplifting in L.A.  Beverly Hills.  Oscar-nominated actress Winona Ryder.  Let's see.  Arrested on Wednesday night at a posh Beverly Hills department store  for a legendary shoplifting $5,000 worth of clothing.  And they found her with prescription drugs that she didn't have a prescription for.  Gotta love the Vicodin in Hollywood.  And she was released on $20,000 bail. 
[02:25:30]  And now she's got to deal with that.  Shoplifting.  Is she in between rock stars or something?  Yeah, I guess that's it.  Is that what happened?  Yeah, this chick loves the rock stars.  Who is she banging lately?  She's nothing else to do, so.  Who's her latest slam?  Hmm?  Who is she with?  That one guy.  What?  Soul Asylum.  Soul Asylum.  Until that career went down the tubes and then she took right off.  Dave Perner.  Perner.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  But, uh, yeah, I would think Winona's got the five grand to buy some clothes with.  You know, that's like some kind of, one of those weird sicknesses.  I must steal.  Like the cutters.  Maybe she's a cutter, too.  I must paint.  We'll do her life story.  That right there has a life story movie written all over it for a lifetime.  Girl Interrupted.  In the role of Winona Ryder, it's Markie Post in her most dramatic role.  Markie Post playing...  Who's another whore from that channel? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, um...  Joanna Kearns.  Markie Post playing Joanna Kearns playing Winona Ryder.  In the story of...  Valerie Bertinelli.  Valerie Bertinelli.  That'd be a better choice, right?  Valerie Bertinelli.  In a lifetime movie exclusive.  With Susan St. James.  Starring Susan St. James.  Robert Urich.  And Robert Urich.  Post-cancer Robert Urich.  As Winona Ryder's father. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, so she's, uh, she's in trouble.  20 grand bail.  Why, why they...  You know, some people are released on their own recognizance.  Doesn't Winona seem like the kind of gal you can just kind of let out by herself?  She doesn't quite seem like, uh, a risk of fleeing.  She might have been pretty after it.  Maybe she was.  Who knows?  The $20,000 bail tells me that something else is going on here.  Poor Winona.  All right, and, uh, finally, uh, today... 
[02:27:30]  Uh, rock and roll's, uh, class of 2002.  Yeah.  The Ramones and the Talking Heads.  Yes.  In the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for 2002.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Isaac Hayes, Brenda Lee, and Gene Pitney were also inducted.  How about that?  The announcement was made today.  I'm sure the Ramones love the fact that they're, uh, the living ones, anyway. 
[02:28:00]  Doesn't that seem against, like, what they were all about?  Being in this big kind of rock and roll Hall of Fame thing?  I think if you're a punk rocker, I don't think you should be excited about something like that, right?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't seem...  I don't really care.  To tell you the truth, I really could care less.  I don't think...  Most of the bands don't seem to care when they're...  No.  ...nominated into that damn thing, right?  Nah.  Uh, Chris, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I just became lie your ass off to the call screener guy.  Why? 
[02:28:30]  Why?  That's stinky.  That's our own stinky.  Sometimes you gotta do everything to get through, man.  You're lie your ass off to the call screener guy.  Well, so now you got through because you're...  It says on the screen that you're going to be representing New Orleans.  I don't even have a New Orleans accent.  He was up...  I didn't even have a phone number to give him.  He says he's up here with the military.  Ah, smoke another one, stinky.  So you lied and got past stinky. 
[02:29:00]  And now I'm on your show.  And you have nothing now.  Hey, but...  I have a park.  But now you're the character.  I'm the character.  Guy, that doesn't sound like he's from New Orleans.  I get really tired of these new characters.  You guys rock, man.  All right, bye.  That's pretty funny.  That's funny.  He got stinky.  All right, Anthony, quick break.  And we're going to play around.  And what did we learn on the Open Anthony Show?  What an educational smorgasbord we had here today.  We had a lot of fun. 
[02:29:30]  Jim Brewer was supposed to stop in today, but he's in Denver.  And someone failed to tell us that when we booked him for today.  Take your shirt off.  We might have to get him in tomorrow as well.  Make it just one big old party with Brian Regan and Jim Brewer and guys doing the condom thing and girls from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  Those girls better show up this time.  Weren't they supposed to show up for what the hell is that?  Um, no.  The homeless shopping store.  Homeless shopping store.  Oh, right, right, right.  Did you blame them that they backed out of that one? 
[02:30:00]  No, all right.  I heard a few of them showed up, saw what was on the bus, and left.  Seriously?  Yeah.  They were that scared?  They didn't want to be a part of that.  You know what?  I don't blame them.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two A-holes.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony.  Racket 1027.  The many W.  It's time to play, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Very educational.  Before we do, though, Anthony, Tom from Philly has been on hold for two hours and 47 minutes. 
[02:30:30]  Why?  He's been on hold the longest today.  Let's see why he's been holding on for two hours and 47 minutes.  Tom.  Tom.  He probably fell asleep, Anthony.  Tom, are you awake?  Tommy?  It's too bad.  We were going to give him the Aerosmith box set for being the guy on hold the longest today.  Turn the music way down.  Let's hear.  Tom? 
[02:31:00]  Tom?  Tom?  I thought I heard something.  He's gone.  All right, so we'll have to go to second place.  This guy's been on hold for an hour and 22 minutes.  Woof.  All right, who's this?  What day?  Hey, what's up, bro?  Hey, what's up?  You've been on hold for an hour and 20 minutes.  Hey, Norton.  What's up, Norton?  No, Norton's not here today.  Norton, you rule, man.  No, Norton's not here today.  He has something to do.  No.  Mario Cantone.  What's up, man?  No.  Thank you, Bob. 
[02:31:30]  No, it's Opie and Anthony.  No.  You waited an hour and 20 minutes to do this.  Brian Regan?  No, Brian Regan's tomorrow.  Oh.  All right.  I can't figure out who he is.  You guys suck.  Hold on.  We're going to give you something for being on hold the longest.  Oh.  All right, thanks.  An hour and 20 minutes for that.  Adam for us.  No.  Adam.  Hold on.  None of those guys in here.  No, no.  Ben, what do we have for this guy?  Is this saying hello and you rule to people that aren't there, guy?  No, it is.  Okay, I think it is. 
[02:32:00]  We have an Aerosmith prize pack for you, sir, all right?  Is that cool?  Cool.  It includes Permanent Vacation, Pump, Get a Grip, and Young Lust, the anthology.  CDs courtesy of Universal Entertainment.  Hold on the line.  You get that for being the guy on hold the longest today, all right?  Hey, boss.  No, no, no.  That's over.  Thank you.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  We're going to give you the prize.  That's for real.  Let's go to Oscar to start.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Oscar, what's up?  Hey, boy.  I learned that today I just became a really getting sick of all these new characters, guy. 
[02:32:30]  You're not alone.  And that really stinks, especially since I called in before as a can't-take-a-joke guy.  Take it easy, pressure.  All right, bye.  These two guys on the show, guy.  All right, Anthony, a lot of what did we learn today, believe it or not,  and we were just pretty much just screwing off.  Oh, totally.  Dan from Boston, Mass.  Today I learned that ten guys standing in a kiddie pool together peeing in condoms  is the equivalent of a circle jerk.  Yeah.  But it ceases to be gay if you surround the kiddie pool with female strippers.  That is the rule, yeah. 
[02:33:00]  This is from Guy, who instant feedbacks what I learned today,  but doesn't get read as much as Dan from Hoboken Guy.  And he writes,  Today I learned, ah, why bother?  It's not going to get read.  Big Jay from Jersey.  I learned ulcers are caused by potato chips from Dwayne Reed.  Yeah.  Jeff from Jersey.  I learned Rick is both a peeler and a biter.  Kel saying, I learned you need to confuse your fart so it doesn't follow you back into the studio. 
[02:33:30]  Very good.  Today I learned Opie's 91-year-old grandmother is less than 100 years old.  That's Scott from Louisiana.  And, ah, Wren, I learned Anthony's fart protocol is more complicated than a Nassau missile launch.  Yeah.  Kat said, I learned Opie's grandma dodged the cannibalism bullet by nine years.  And Ant likes to reference birds for the size comparison.  And there aren't enough strippers in the world to make this contest less gay.  Hey, Chris, Crinkle, Crinkle. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, guys, what's up?  What's up?  All right.  Today I learned, tomorrow is the junk in a bag contest.  Yeah.  Ah, let's see.  I have to leave a breadcrumb trail to find my way out of foundrymusic.com.  Right.  Very true.  Rick nibbles his relatives nubs.  Right.  And there's a no-fart policy in the studio because Norton stinks.  Right.  He does stink.  Later, guys.  All right, bye.  But who's not listening tomorrow when we do that little comment thing?  Oh, of course.  Who knows what's going to happen?  That's just it.  And Brian Regan and his brother and possibly Jim Brewer stopping by. 
[02:34:30]  It's like, I think it's like the people in the old war movies that step on the landmine.  And then they just got to stand there.  It's going to be a bunch of guys with potential explosive, disgusting, big bags of their own fluids.  You know what, yeah.  And it's just a matter of time before they go off, pretty much.  You're going to see guys drenched in their own and other people's fluids.  Colossomy Bag from Ohio.  Thank you, Cleveland, by the way. 
[02:35:00]  We said it earlier.  Yes.  We got a nice ratings trend from Cleveland.  Things are looking up in Cleveland.  Oh, yeah.  And Boston, well, it looks like you guys like fake radio better than reality.  There you go.  But we'll work on it.  Colossomy Bag from Ohio writes,  I learned that Opie would rather go to the White Swallows spa than have a fake wedding.  Anthony from West Orange.  Look, he learned you have to pinch, twist, and pull.  Oh, good.  Right.  So you hit your yam bag. 
[02:35:30]  I think we only did that for New York during the commercial break.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Jersey Gary writes,  I learned on the ONA show today, it's back to Yankee Cranky if you screw up Opie's sushi order.  $3.50 an hour guy, Memento John is dumber than a box of rocks, and he's wet, too.  Fatty tuna sushi tastes like a slab of margarine on rice.  It'll cost me $5 for a small cup of coffee at the ONA studios.  Black stool is a medical term.  And Danny Glover could hail a cab in New York if he lost half his blood. 
[02:36:00]  Todd from Buffalo.  I learned that frothy coffee drinks and watching guys leak is always gay.  And yellow discipline from Queens.  Today I learned weight is weight.  Weight is weight.  We did learn that.  Danny, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Daddy.  Hey, I learned today that Norton's going to be packing seven tomorrow with all that yellow discipline flying around.  Crinkle, crinkle. 
[02:36:30]  Crinkle, crinkle.  Very good, bro.  Let's go to Rebecca in D.C.  Hello.  D.C. has voted us, I think, worst radio show, by the way.  Thank you.  They're working on it.  Or they're trying to vote us in as worst radio show.  Yeah.  Rebecca, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I don't think you guys are the worst radio show.  Oh, okay.  And there's a lot of people that listen to you.  But what I learned today was, after 25 years of living, Opie and Anthony have brought my family together.  You are the only common ground that my dad and I can discuss. 
[02:37:00]  Otherwise, we don't even talk to each other.  Look at that.  So you guys discuss, what, incest?  No, no.  We discuss the day's topics.  We discuss how retarded some of the people you work with are.  We finally have something that we can talk about and we can actually relate to each other.  And what does Dad do for a living?  He manages a home entertainment store out in Manassas called Audio Buys. 
[02:37:30]  Okay.  There you go.  I don't know if you've ever heard of that.  Well, thank you, Rebecca.  We're bringing families together.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You're doing good things.  Cool.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I learned today, this is Mr. Crowley from Queens.  Cleveland, don't care about the news.  Opie is prick guy and PlayStation 2 guy.  To find Phillip's coffee, you need the staff, the crystal, and the map room.  That's very good.  And there's a big difference between two and nine when you bite your sister's boobs.  Yeah.  I learned nobody but Opie knows where Phillip's is. 
[02:38:00]  I learned Stinky is confused a lot when taking calls.  Line one, you said?  All right.  Let's go to Ernie O.  Ernie O.  What's up?  How are you, bro?  Yeah.  How's it going, bro?  How are we having fun?  Today I learned that you may have given Earl Blackstools, but at least you didn't break it like Ben's.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  Nice reference.  Going way back with a callback.  All right.  Take care.  Thank you.  Look at Steve P.  He says, Anthony is easygoing guy, except when he's explaining why he's easygoing guy. 
[02:38:30]  He's absolutely right.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that my jokes are never funny enough to get on the radio, guys.  Why?  You call Stinky all the time with a joke and he blows you off?  Oh, he hangs up on me.  But Stinky rules.  Yes, he does.  What was your last joke that you were trying to get on the air?  Oh, I can't even remember.  Probably too bad to remember.  All right.  Thank you.  Anthony, we've got to get the hell out of here.  Yeah.  Tomorrow's the big show. 
[02:39:00]  Brian Regan in studio with his brother playing Caroline's all this weekend.  And I'm telling you, tickets go fast when Brian comes to town.  Very funny guy.  I would call ahead.  We're going to do the whole thing for the Xbox.  It's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow.  Two Regans for the price of one.  Two.  That's right.  Even one show, you get two Regans.  Even if it's one show.  Two Regans.  Is that filler to get us to $6.52?  Yeah.  Well, we made it.  Thanks.  What's the meaning of this slacking off?  Dude, it's all we need.  Whatever. 
[02:39:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A smorgasbord of idiocy.  The greatest radio that I've ever heard. </pre>
