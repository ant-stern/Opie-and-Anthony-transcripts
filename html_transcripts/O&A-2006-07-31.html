<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and vulgar banter, describing themselves with offensive terms. Norton recounts a recent stand-up performance in Nashville, sharing anecdotes about audience reactions and a family’s surprisingly positive response to his HBO special's adult humor.  A caller then relates a hilariously disastrous $3,000 attempt to see Norton's show.

A significant portion of the show is dedicated to discussing a recent commercial shoot for the show, focusing heavily on Opie's antics.  E-Rock's photos from the shoot, taken in a sweltering clothing store, are discussed, along with the subsequent online criticism of Opie's appearance and behavior, including his ride on a children's toy outside the store. The hosts detail the chaotic nature of the shoot, highlighting the large crew and union regulations.  The conversation shifts to the newly launched Whoopi Goldberg morning radio show on WKTU, with Opie and Anthony playing clips and mocking its polite and overly-mannered format, contrasting it with their own style.  They criticize Whoopi Goldberg's co-host's apparent subservience and the show's ineffective, unfunny tone, particularly highlighting distracting background music. This is juxtaposed with their own upcoming expansion to Chicago and San Francisco. Mel Gibson's recent drunk driving arrest is also briefly discussed, with speculation about a potential career change to shock jock radio. The segment concludes with further criticism of Whoopi Goldberg's show and doubts about its longevity, briefly mentioning Steve Dahl's legendary disco demolition night.


The next segment dives into Mel Gibson's drunk driving arrest, focusing on his alleged anti-Semitic and offensive remarks.  Audio clips from news sources are played, interspersed with the hosts' highly offensive commentary and jokes about Gibson's behavior and views. They speculate on the arrest details, including his attempted escape and belligerent behavior.  The alleged alteration of the police report is also discussed. A listener call briefly interrupts the discussion. The second main topic is a prank orchestrated on Fox 5 New York reporter Jody Applegate. Audio and video clips showcase the prank, which involved faking an injury during a live bike theft prevention segment, resulting in Applegate’s enraged reaction.  The pranksters, present in studio, and the hosts discuss the prank, Applegate's reaction, and the media coverage, celebrating the prank's success. Listener calls are played, and Will Ferrell calls in briefly to promote *Talladega Nights*. The segment ends with further discussion of the Gibson story, the Whoopi Goldberg prank, and the successful spread of the "ONA virus" to new radio markets.  Highly offensive language and humor are prevalent throughout.

A phone interview with Will Ferrell follows, promoting *Talladega Nights*. The hosts discuss Ferrell's career and jokingly suggest various *Elf* sequels, such as "Elf goes to communist China."  The conversation shifts to Mel Gibson and his behavior. The main focus then turns to a prank call campaign targeting Whoopi Goldberg’s show, "Wake Up With Whoopi," with clips highlighting offensive and disruptive calls from listeners ("pests"). The hosts analyze Whoopi and Cubby's reactions, finding them humorous and clumsy. Their strategy is explained as driven by boredom and a desire to disrupt what they perceive as a bland program.  Offensive language and crude humor are frequent.  Listener calls, including racist and antisemitic remarks about Whoopi Goldberg, are also played.  Big Kev's awkward celebrity interviews at Comic-Con are discussed, highlighting his short, uncomfortable exchanges with Samuel L. Jackson, Hilary Swank, and others. The segment concludes with promotion of their comedy tour and XM radio show, mentioning upcoming guests like Mark Burnett and the cast of *The Descent*.

The following segment details Big Kev’s disastrous Comic-Con interviews with Topher Grace, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Bryan Singer, Daniel Day Kim, Jorge Garcia, Eva Mendes, and others. His simplistic and sometimes inappropriate questions lead to uncomfortable silences and terse responses. The hosts comment on the brevity and Kev's poor performance, using crude language.  They highlight incidents with publicists, including Kev being asked to leave by Kirsten Dunst's publicist. The segment includes listener calls, including a suicidal caller, and a discussion of Shane Rover French's cancelled radio show, which Opie and Anthony will replace.  The segment ends with a more successful interview with the cast of *The Descent*, who are in the studio.

The show features a studio interview with the actresses, Sean and Natalie, from *The Descent*, followed by a phone interview with Mark Burnett.  The conversation with the actresses covers their film, on-set experiences, and relationship statuses.  The Mark Burnett interview focuses on his TV projects, including anecdotes from previous appearances on the Opie and Anthony show, frequently veering into sexually explicit and offensive territory, covering topics such as penis size, circumcision, and Tommy Lee's sex tape.  *Gold Rush*, Burnett's online treasure hunt game, is discussed in detail. The conversation also touches on the changing media landscape. A listener's negative feedback on a previous Disturbed interview is briefly addressed. The segment concludes with promotion of their upcoming appearances and radio shows, and a news report on their prank calls to Whoopi Goldberg's show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  O.P.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm Dan.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[00:01:00]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Brand new intro.  There you have it.  And that's how we begin.  Another week.  That's right.  Time to run through this crap one more time. 
[00:01:30]  Blaster a smile on our face.  Pretend we give a damn.  And run through it.  No.  I actually do look forward to coming here.  If it was a little later, perfect job.  Perfect.  That's like one hour later.  Like we used to have it.  The world needs ditch diggers too, you know.  Phones are lit already.  What's going on? 
[00:02:00]  We haven't even done anything yet.  Not a damn thing.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Hope you had a good weekend.  Blah, blah, blah.  All right, Iraq.  We know about how you love the photographs of O.P. and everything.  But maybe you could put the camera to its normal location.  The wide angle thing.  You don't have to zoom in on O.P.  There you go.  Now we can wave and say hi.  There it is. 
[00:02:30]  It's okay.  He'll still be here.  Yeah, it's getting a little creepy.  Glittle.  Stalker E-Rock.  How close are you to a restraining order?  A lot of people loving the intro, Steve.  There you go.  That was an epic, awesome intro.  Bert from Philly.  Bill from Waterford.  Very funny open.  Robert Reed will add a lot to the program.  He has over the years, hasn't he?  Robert Reed more successful on this program than anything else he's ever done. 
[00:03:00]  And it was after he was dead.  We love him.  And little Jimmy Norton back in studio.  Yes, back in the south.  Back from Nashville, Tennessee.  Yeehaw.  It was nice.  How'd it go, Lamb?  They were really hardcore.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.  Really good.  Good.  One show I wasn't too happy with Saturday Night Show.  I was kind of like tired.  And they were tired, but they were nice.  We're sleepy. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, we were all just kind of polite to each other.  That's nice.  Cordial.  Yeah.  Did you say please before you presented a joke?  And then they said thank you after?  They would chuckle and nod, and I would nod, and we'd all look at each other going,  well, that probably went better on the early show.  Because they were outside, the early show was sold out, and it was like lunacy, and they  all heard it.  So then they came in, and there was half of them.  What, they could hear you doing your act as they're online for the late show?  Yeah.  That's a little weird.  Yeah, it was kind of creepy. 
[00:04:00]  But it was great.  I enjoyed it.  Very nice.  Thank you, Nashville.  And Zanies took great care of me.  My whole family watched Jimmy on HBO on, what day was this now?  Saturday night, I was at my sister's house for my nephew's birthday party.  Ooh, cake.  Oh, all that goodness.  And then everything, everyone kind of started leaving, and then just the family was left  behind, and we're watching your HBO show again.  It was a lot of fun.  Little kids loved all the dirty jokes.  Of course. 
[00:04:30]  Little kids love curse words.  I don't know what we're trying to protect them from.  They chuckle.  My sister is the sweetest, nicest thing.  I mean, complete opposite of me, right?  And her husband just lets the kids watch whatever the hell they want, curses in front of them.  He don't care.  So there's my eight-year-old nephew and six-year-old niece watching Jimmy on HBO with us.  Isn't that wonderful?  Isn't that great?  Hey, this guy spent $3,000 trying to get to Zaney's to see Jim Norton. 
[00:05:00]  Dave in Texas, what's up?  How's it going?  Hey.  Hi, Dave.  Started off headed up there, blocked the motor up in my truck, got a rental car, got two speeding  tickets, and then hydroplaned and hit a tree.  Cool.  Did you make the show?  Never made the show.  Ah.  All right, well, screw them.  Wait, you spent $3,000, though?  The tickets are $500 and something a page, the rental car with the insurance.  Hold on.  Let's slow down. 
[00:05:30]  A ticket for Jim Norton was over $500?  The tickets?  No, no, no.  The speeding tickets.  The speeding tickets.  I thought Jimmy was really trying to shake down his list.  Yeah, there's three people at the late show, and I still made a bonus.  $500 a ticket, sir.  I got to pay them.  All right, well.  All right, you got nothing.  I said, so you basically hide your plane, and you didn't make Jimmy's show, and it cost  you $3,000.  Yeah, I'm heading back to the Army base now.  Stupid me was trying to get a little more out of you. 
[00:06:00]  God forbid.  It looks like you had a great story, but this is going nowhere, so let's cut our losses.  Very hard this early.  Yeah, I understand.  With the listeners involved.  They start waking up a little after we do.  The owner's a big fan of the show, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Massive fan, so thank you for taking care.  Well, then I won't say one thing that you said about him.  Yeah, we'll keep it under our hats, as we say up north.  All right, our phone number's 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  And if you've only been up for a few minutes, don't call the program. 
[00:06:30]  That phone number's for the people that have been up for about an hour.  Yeah.  All right?  So, well, E-Rock took a whole bunch of pictures of me and two pictures of you, it looks like.  Yeah, yeah, that seems to be...  I mean, you kind of referred to that right off the bat today.  Yeah, and we did our commercial shoot.  Our shoot.  That was fun.  It was very long.  Very hot.  But a lot of fun.  And we just wanted a couple of still pics of us on the set doing our commercial. 
[00:07:00]  So, E-Rock had his camera and took some pictures.  One picture of me, a virtual layout of photos of Opie.  Who, if you remember, E-Rock had listed as one of his heroes.  Right behind his dad.  Right behind dad.  And right above Hulk Hogan.  I'm in good company.  Opie, Hulk Hogan on his hero list on MySpace.  Wasn't it dad, me, Hulk Hogan?  Who was it?  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Now he doesn't even try to like it.  No, it was...  Yeah.  Now he just looks and goes, yes.  Yes, it was.  You got a problem?  Hero.  I beat out Hulk Hogan on his hero list.  And I never made the list, by the way.  No.  And you can tell by...  You don't count on anybody.  Let's be honest.  ...the picture taken.  He just jumped on me a little bit about the fact that I said, when we were downstairs changing,  uh, we were sweating so bad that our stupid little blue shirts were getting like water  stains on them, so we had to put on these wife beaters t-shirts to like soak it up a 
[00:08:00]  little bit.  To soak up the sweat.  It was very hot under the lights.  Very hot under the lights.  Well, we had, uh, this lady on set that was just blow drying us.  Yeah.  In between takes.  Yeah.  We should explain.  We were in this, uh, store on the Lower East Side.  Mm-hmm.  Don't want to give too much away, even though, uh, I think the pictures give a lot away,  but that's all right.  They're, they're putting the pieces together, but the commercial is going to be...  A couple of people.  The commercial is going to be for people that don't know we're back or, or maybe, uh, hopefully,  uh, new fans that will jump by board after they, uh, see the, the TV spots. 
[00:08:30]  So we're...  For the people that already know who we are.  So we're in this, uh, this, uh, clothing shop and, uh, you know, because they're trying  to film the commercial, all the windows have to be closed because they don't want the  outside traffic.  They turned off the AC unit.  They turned off the fans that someone brought in thinking that would, you know, keep the  place cool.  And then, um, and then, uh, yeah, then they started to shoot the commercial and the reality  was there's probably 120 to 130 degrees inside the store. 
[00:09:00]  Really hot.  And in between shots, like, all right, you guys, uh, we have to set the lights.  It's going to take about an hour.  You guys could go outside and we would go outside.  And I was commenting, wow, it's nice and cool today, you know, because you're leaving  this hot environment going outside and someone had to look at me and go, uh, it's 92 degrees.  Yeah.  It just felt cooler when, uh, it felt so much cooler when we went outside, but, uh, we couldn't  keep anything, uh, uh, dry.  So they're like using a hairdryer to blow our shirts dry, our skin dry.  So we, we had to put these wife beaters on and, uh, we were in the dressing room, you 
[00:09:30]  know, changing and Iraq's got his camera out and starts snapping pictures of opium, a  wife beater.  Uh, and he, he kind of looked at me and I went, take one picture of me in this wife  beater and I'll kill you.  Cause, uh, you know, I'm a skinny guy and I look like, I looked like when I, when I was  seven in a wife beater running around, see some of my home movies when I'm seven years  old in a wife beater, same thing, only with a goatee now.  Uh, and, uh, so Iraq now is using that as the excuse as to why there's one photo of me 
[00:10:00]  in my, uh, clothes that I used on the commercial and like 20 pictures of opie, but I see it  more.  I was, I was bored.  So I was just posing and getting stupid.  And again, the wonderful people on, uh, some of our favorite message boards, uh, taking  a few photos and deciding that the commercial is going to suck based on nothing but a couple 
[00:10:30]  of photos, most of which weren't even taken, none taken on the set.  Uh, once taken down.  Well, there was a couple taken on the set when they were blow drying.  Oh, well, another one of me on the set as they were taking a hairdryer to my chest to  dry it off.  Yeah.  That was a technically on the set.  You can see the camera equipment in the background, but not with us in position or anything.  It wasn't giving away what's going on in the commercial or anything like that.  And, uh, people are like going, Oh, this looks wacky. 
[00:11:00]  This looks like they're doing something wacky, like wacky DJ thing.  It's like, no, it fits.  It fits the show.  It's funny.  What made me chuckle on the, on one of the fan sites, they're talking about my hair  going, Oh, he should never be able to, uh, joke about E-Rock's hair again.  They made my hair look completely.  Why can you frigging idiots understand?  They thought I got this really bad haircut and I've been walking around like that for, 
[00:11:30]  for a week.  Yeah.  No, my hair is a little shorter than usual.  And, uh, for this commercial shoot, they had to do something different with it.  That made me look like a dork.  Okay.  I'll give it away.  I look like a dork.  That, the, what, the clothes we were wearing and like, what, what are they wearing?  Look out.  They look stupid.  Yeah.  It's cause you're filming something.  Not going through real life.  Jackasses.  Some of these people, it's very few, believe me, but some of them just really are retarded 
[00:12:00]  and should not be allowed to post on message boards.  But, uh, there they are.  I hope he's hair.  He shouldn't be able to make.  Do you, do you think a hair, the hair and makeup person went down there and, and gave  us the, the hair and makeup we wanted and the clothing we wanted?  Yeah.  We want to look cool.  Could you slick my hair down like a dolt?  They just don't get it.  It was very fun though.  Learned a lot.  It was pretty cool.  It's done on film. 
[00:12:30]  It's not like video.  It's done on real film.  So it's, uh, can have a very professional polished look to it.  Can't wait.  Can't wait till it's done.  I think it's going to be, uh, complete, uh, completed by Thursday.  I think they're going to show us like the finished commercial when we're in Boston.  Yeah.  We're at least going to see a rough cut of it Thursday.  We're broadcasting live from WBCN this Friday in Boston.  And, uh, I think Thursday night they're going to show us how the commercial is going to  look.  So we're kind of excited about that.  You notice everybody on those sets are from the same mold, like the grip. 
[00:13:00]  They just pull out of a grip mold.  He's the same grip that's on everything.  The, uh, director of, uh, photography, he's the same guy.  He's the same type of personality.  They all have these personalities that are all the same no matter where you go to meet  these people.  Yeah.  It's amazing what they, uh, it was definitely a fun experience.  Yeah.  We've never done anything like that before.  Pretty cool.  So, and he rock, uh, enjoyed taking the pictures and they're up on op and anthony.com.  So, and I was goofing around cause people are looking at to my pictures, like what is wrong 
[00:13:30]  with him?  Exactly.  I was having fun just goofing around because in between like shots that we had to wait  an hour, sometimes longer.  I was, I was out of my mind.  Yeah.  A lot of waiting.  And I decided to jump on one of those like little rides you see outside the supermarket  that put a couple of quarters in and ride the little horsey that are for like kids  that are two and under.  Yeah.  And people are calling me a faggot for doing that.  Yeah.  Like I would do that during my regular life. 
[00:14:00]  And people, what was I doing it?  Cause it would make a, for a funny photo.  You ass.  People thought it was a part of the commercial.  Oh really?  No.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, they go, if op is on that, uh, little rocking, whatever it was for  the commercial, then it's too, too wacky.  It's like, and then, and then I feel compelled to write no jerk.  It's not part of the commercial.  It's another one of E-Rock's volumes of pictures he took of opi. 
[00:14:30]  How many pictures did you take, E-Rock?  Oh, that's up there.  How many?  Uh, 15, 16 photos.  How many of Anthony?  I think there's two.  You, you, I saw one.  One.  Somebody commented.  No, there's one of you and I outside just drinking our coffee sitting in.  Is there?  Sitting in kind of like those director seats.  Yeah, right here.  Here's the second one.  I got a cup of coffee.  I'm talking to Mark Chernoff and you're standing.  Oh, there it is.  Adjusting your belt. 
[00:15:00]  Adjusting your belt.  My fine belt.  So, yeah, you can check out the pictures for yourself on opiandanthony.com.  But it was a lot of fun.  It was a long day Saturday.  We, uh, we had to be there at five in the morning and we didn't leave until like three  in the afternoon.  Yeah.  And we were pretty much standing on our feet the whole time, sweating our you-know-what's  off.  But again, you know, before we did this, I was one of those people, too, that's like,  just shut up when you hear actors talking.  It's such, you know, hard work and we're in there.  And I'm like, just shut up. 
[00:15:30]  It is not.  You stand there in front of a camera and do a few lines and sit down.  It's nothing.  And then when you do something like that, you realize, wow, this is pretty tough stuff.  People yelling at you.  It's like eight million degrees.  You got to stand in one spot for an hour and then go somewhere else.  Go across the street.  Like, and I'm the guy, I'm like, don't bother me guy.  Right.  So during lunch, I just wanted to eat and they're like worried about anything getting  on our costumes that we're wearing, our suits. 
[00:16:00]  So I'm just like, could you just give me a sheet and I'll put over me and then up back  into your clothes.  Get over there because they're ironing them in between.  And so when they were doing that, that's when I jumped on the ducky in my regular clothes.  It seems like they hire 10 times the people they need.  Oh, yeah.  It's just 10 times the people they need.  I had some dumb little problem with my tie or something.  I'm like, hey, can you fix this?  Oh, my God.  What?  That's not my department. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Not my job.  This person freaks out.  I'm like, all right.  I don't know how this works.  There's a guy.  Now, they could have, the camera was on a dolly at one point and they had to go back  to the first position, which is a close up on us, you know, tighter on us.  And the camera was way back on the dolly.  So they needed the guy to push the camera up in order to make certain adjustments.  They had to wait for this guy.  They couldn't just push it up and then do what they had to do to save some time. 
[00:17:00]  Had to wait for the guy.  Because God forbid anyone touches that thing, the union goes crazy.  All hell would break loose.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's just, they've gotten that thing so down where a lot of people can make a lot of money.  That's why, like, you and I had to wait around all day.  Yeah.  That's why movies cost so much to make.  All day.  I can't imagine what it takes to make a two and a half hour action movie.  I can't imagine. 
[00:17:30]  At one point, someone's on a headset and they're like, all right, we're bringing the actors  to set.  And I'm like, wow, who's here?  Actors to set.  All right, lock it down.  Sound.  Rolling.  Keep it quiet.  Outside.  But there was one point when the guy was on the walkie-talkie saying, bring an actress  to set.  I looked around like, yeah, who's in this commercial?  Who's here?  I want to see some actors.  Maybe I'll get a picture with them.  No.  You and I were the actors. 
[00:18:00]  It's just us.  But I had no clue.  All right, but that was a lot of fun.  The pictures are up on opianthony.com.  A little sneak peek at the commercial shoot.  A lot of people asking where it's going to air.  Hopefully in every market we're in.  Yeah, it's definitely going to be all over the New York market.  We'll get the commercial no matter what online.  All the majors.  And then I think some of the other cities are going to pick up the commercial and just  throw their tag on it for the radio station you're hearing us on.  Yeah.  So we'll see.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've got lots to do today. 
[00:18:30]  Mel Gibson, drunk driving.  It's one of the greatest stories of the year.  The drunk driving is the peripheral story on that whole thing.  Oh, absolutely.  He's out of his mind.  I think he wants to be a shock jock.  Shock jock, Mel.  I think he wants to be a shock jock.  And then Whoopi Goldberg is our big competition here in New York.  She started up today.  We partook in a little of the Whoopi this morning.  And uh-oh.  All I can say is, uh-oh, we're in trouble.  Yeah, I don't know how we're going to compete with the Whoopi. 
[00:19:00]  Ooh.  Waking up with Whoopi in the morning.  Whoopi and Cubby.  Yeah, it's really bad.  They were giving, like, heat tips.  And they said, coming up, we'll tell you what time it is or something?  We're going to be talking about, um, what time.  What did you say?  We're going to be talking about, uh, the heat.  And we're going to be giving you the time.  And really, the time.  Well, I best stay tuned.  I best sit through the break. 
[00:19:30]  So I can find out what time it is.  And then when we get back, you know we say, going into every break, the O&A virus spreading across America.  Yes.  It spreads big time starting tomorrow.  Starting tomorrow.  And we'll give you the details in just a bit.  Also remember something we came up with years ago.  Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We'll give you the details next.  When you go to this effing show, there are few words that you must know.  Learn to punch. 
[00:20:00]  I'm punching out.  I'm punching out.  Punch down.  Punch down.  You guys are great.  You never do that angry.  Where are you going on?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:20:30]  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  We're heading into another heat wave here in New York City.  So, I don't know.  The local news is doing their cute little update on the Middle East.  Yeah.  And World War III.  And then they go into weather breaks and what you can do to beat the heat.  With a nice graphic.  Beat the heat.  They actually cut the guy off.  Check on the elderly.  They actually cut the guy off.  The expert, right?  Yeah, not expert. 
[00:21:00]  Just some guy that's in the Middle East.  I think he was in Lebanon.  He's an expert.  He's there.  Yeah, he's there.  He's there and he has a microphone.  He's an expert on the Middle East and what's going on over there.  He's talking about the situation and the woman anchor for the morning show is cutting him off.  Like, talking over him.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  To cut him off so they can go to beat the heat, the summer scorcher, and then they play a taped piece.  From yesterday.  From yesterday.  Some dude on a beach. 
[00:21:30]  That's the priorities.  In the middle of the afternoon.  That's the priorities.  Unbelievable.  We got whoopee audio.  Oh, good.  You want to do Mel Gibson or you want to do whoopee?  If we got the whoopee audio, I'd like to hear a little whoopee.  You know, we like to know what our competition is doing in every fine market we're in.  Yes.  And here in New York, we've got to start paying a little attention because, hey, whoopee is here and she's doing radio.  You can wake up with whoopee. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  How about that?  Oh, should we tell people?  Just ask Ted Danson how pleasurable that was.  Waking up with whoopee.  I want to talk about shocking.  Hey, should we tell the folks where we're going to be spreading the virus?  Yeah, let's get that right out of the way.  Very excited to announce.  It's kind of like a dream come true.  We are going to be on in Chicago.  Chicago.  Starting tomorrow.  We do mornings. 
[00:22:30]  Mornings, Chicago.  For WCKG.  Yep.  The home of Steve Dahl.  Yeah.  Steve Dahl is at WCKG.  He's the anchor of the station and he's been kicking ass for many, many, many, many, many years.  And we get to join that fine lineup over there in Chicago.  I remember when he was in New York, we had him on our show when we were at NEW and had a blast with him hanging out.  Right.  BSing.  Right.  Yeah, had a lot of fun.  And he did the greatest radio promotion ever. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Ever.  We're up there.  I mean, we're up there.  If there's a top ten, we're up there.  Yeah, but you...  Steve Dahl did the most amazing radio promotion ever.  He pretty much burnt down...  Yeah.  It was like an explosion.  He pretty much burnt down Comiskey Park back in the day.  That's a biggie.  His disco demolition thing.  No, what we should do, if he's up, we should get Lee Abrams on the phone because he knows all about the ins and outs of the Steve Dahl promotion. 
[00:23:30]  But basically, when disco was taking over the world, kind of like how rap is taking over the world right now, Steve Dahl made a stance and said, you know, disco sucks and we need to get rid of disco.  And basically, he had listeners send in all their disco albums and he would blow them up on the air.  Yep.  You know, it was part of his thing.  He was doing this, you know, and then he decided to take it to the next level and Chicago, the Chicago White Sox needed a little promotion because their team sucked so bad. 
[00:24:00]  So they said okay to Steve Dahl.  Yeah.  And in between a double header, Steve Dahl comes out and they pile up like thousands of disco records.  I think you could get into the game at a really ridiculous discounted price if you brought a disco record with you.  Right.  It was probably the call letters of the station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dollar five.  Of course.  Yeah, I'm sure it was.  Dollar five or whatever the call letters were of the station back then.  And that's how they were able to get so many of these disco records. 
[00:24:30]  So they pile it up.  They got like a bulldozer and they're making one big pile with the disco records.  And there's Steve Dahl, walks out with the microphone, and they blow it up.  See, this is why we need Lee Abrams.  Like, what started the fire?  They blew it up somehow.  Yeah, they had some kind of pyrotechnics team come in and wire this mountain.  Yeah, because I don't think they wanted a fire because they had to play a second game.  Yeah.  So they blow up the pile of disco records and they –  It's a shrapnel of disco records when flying everywhere. 
[00:25:00]  It lit kind of like into a bonfire, a huge fire on the field, and then everyone just freaking started rioting.  Yeah, it was a big riot.  And this is why I love Steve Dahl.  They told – this is what Lee Abrams told me recently.  He goes, they wanted Steve Dahl to go back on the PA to try to calm everyone down because it was pretty much his listeners at the game.  And Steve Dahl said, uh-uh, and snuck out as all hell is –  I ain't going out there.  All hell is breaking loose at the park, sneaks out, becomes the news for, like, for days. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, it was huge.  And it's what he's known for.  And I guess the Chicago White Sox had to actually forfeit the second game, which is a very rare occurrence in Major League Baseball.  Yeah.  So Steve Dahl is on WCKG, and he's welcoming us, and that's really cool.  We start up in Chicago tomorrow morning.  Think that would get you fired these days, blowing up a –  No, I don't think so.  A baseball stadium.  Honestly, no.  Definitely not.  No, you don't think so? 
[00:26:00]  No, because it was a promotion – oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Yeah, it probably would.  I was going to – stupid man was going to be – no, it was a promotion that everyone knew about and agreed to.  Yeah, sure.  It was sponsored.  It was sponsored.  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Dan in Chicago.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, I'm going to congratulate you.  I'm coming into Chicago for one thing.  Why do you think Mancow must have left Chicago?  You think he learned you guys were coming in, so he knew he couldn't compete with you guys, so he left?  You know, we'd love to say that that was the fact of the matter, but everything I'm hearing is he is such an ass to work with, such a complete tool. 
[00:26:30]  And, you know, I wish we weren't under FCC regulations right here so I could really express myself.  But just, you know, throw in a bunch of F and C words, and I think you'll understand what people think about this guy.  Yeah.  That he was pretty much run out of town.  He had okay ratings.  That's what it comes down to. 
[00:27:00]  He didn't have ratings where you get fired.  Believe me.  He didn't have ratings where they go, you know, sorry, dude, your ratings aren't good.  We've got to let you go.  He's just such an incredible a-hole to work with that they couldn't take it anymore and said, look, your contract's up.  Just leave.  We're going to run an iPod pretty much in your place.  Right.  You're being replaced by an iPod.  Just leave.  We can't deal with you anymore.  So he has no home in Chicago.  Now we swoop in and we get to do more in Chicago. 
[00:27:30]  Hey, how you doing?  It's going to be a huge challenge because Chicago radio is unlike any other city.  I've got to tell you, like, you know, we're in some fine cities and they're embracing us.  They're embracing us in Boston and Pittsburgh and Cleveland and Philly and West Palm.  I could keep going on and on.  Chicago, they like to embrace their own.  They like their hometown guys in Chicago.  They like their hometown guys.  So I'm not going to lie to you.  It's going to be a very, very tough battle, but we're up for the challenge.  That's for sure.  But Chicago has been legendary. 
[00:28:00]  They like their guys and the outsiders, they kind of politely listen to here and there.  So this show's always been pretty universal, though.  It's like not really regional or anything.  Right.  So we get to shove it in a man cow's face.  We're doing mornings in Chicago and he's not anymore.  And it's his hometown.  Starting as far as radio goes.  I'm starting to feel a little like a hyena or a vulture, though.  Why?  Because we come swooping in after the corpse is dead.  Well, and on a daily basis, we get to piss off Howard because we're sitting in his seat. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Here in New York.  That's why we came up with it years ago.  Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  With more listeners than he could dream of having, by the way, which is unbelievable that  people even argue this point on message boards.  Yeah.  Yeah, please.  They're like, you know, how we do.  Yeah, okay.  We have more listeners.  Sorry.  It's just the way it is.  It's a fact. 
[00:29:00]  Deal with it.  All right.  Eric in Colorado, what's up?  Hey, man.  I just want to start off by saying screw Howard.  Secondly, man, I'm going down to San Antonio from Colorado Springs listening to you guys  on XM.  You guys are kicking ass, man.  Keep it up.  Thanks, Eric.  That's right.  That's all you want to say?  All right, cool.  Also, about that Steve Dahl disco demolition night thing?  Yep.  Nickel beers that night.  Oh, that just completes the holy trinity.  The pictures are up all over the place. 
[00:29:30]  Could you get these pictures linked to hopinganthony.com?  Because for the people I've never heard about what happened at Comiskey Park back in the  day, I think it was like 1979, maybe?  That would put it at the...  July 12th, 1979.  All right, good.  Yeah, 1979.  Put it in that disco sucks era.  You've got to see these pictures.  People just start charging the field after the fire got out of control, and they just  show just a mob of people, like the White Sox just won the World Series.  No, it was just a dopey radio promotion that went wrong. 
[00:30:00]  What's the link that you got, E-Rock?  It's a whole long thing.  It's a whole long thing?  All right, we'll link it to hopinganthony.com.  But we start up in Chicago tomorrow, and we just wanted to tell everyone we're really  excited.  Also, we get to...  What time are we on in...  I think middays, right?  Where?  San Francisco.  Oh, I'm not sure.  When are we on?  We're also going to be on KIFR in San Francisco.  Is that an FM, hopefully?  Yeah, free FM.  Free FM.  Okay, KIFR. 
[00:30:30]  It's a free FM station in San Francisco.  We start up there tomorrow as well.  So two huge markets.  Join the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow.  Chicago and San Francisco.  Growing and growing.  More listeners every day.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Professor Anthony.  Yes.  When do you guys swoop in on dead corpses?  Dead corpses are already dead.  I don't know of any...  Yeah.  Well, that's a little picky, my friend. 
[00:31:00]  Also, Mankow wasn't a hometown Chicago personality.  I said that.  As far as radio goes, though, that was his hometown.  Yeah.  That's where his base of operation was.  Base of operations was there, but I'm going to try to get another base of operation.  Of course, I had between 3 and 12 million people listen to me on a daily basis.  What?  Could you get your...  Like, get a real voice.  Oh, that's right.  In his press release, he said anywhere from 3 to 12.  There we're getting... 
[00:31:30]  And we're still our syndicated stations.  We're still syndicating to a lot of markets out there.  I believe we have Hulawaka Gaka, Michigan, which we're broadcasting to.  He's got syndicated markets, but they're, like, all little...  Little media markets.  Smalls.  Cute little markets.  Well, good luck.  Got a couple.  Good luck to you.  All right.  And Chicago won't have them.  Bringing people right around.  This is especially for the rest of America. 
[00:32:00]  Wake up with Whoopi in the morning.  What?  I nodded off when you said the title.  What?  What station is running her?  WKTU?  Didn't they learn from Free FM's mistake of having David Lee Roth?  Weren't they paying attention?  Jesus.  Celebrities cannot do radio.  Whoopi Lee Roth.  It's very rare.  Celebrities cannot do radio.  Very rare can a celebrity do radio. 
[00:32:30]  They have to have a lot of personnel.  I'll tell you one guy that can do it.  Because they don't have the work ethic.  Danny Bonaduce.  That guy was able to at least do radio.  But he wasn't a celebrity.  He was on TV for a few years.  When he was 10.  When he was a kid.  But he didn't have radio experience.  Kind of.  He kind of got thrown into it.  I'm talking A-list, B-list celebrities.  When you get down to the C and the D-list celebrities, you know, they don't have many choices.  But someone like Whoopi.  Mike Luckenland? 
[00:33:00]  He could easily do radio.  There you go.  He could easily do radio.  He's not a real celebrity.  Well, he's going to talk about what a train wreck his life is, too.  Most celebrities aren't willing to do that.  That's true.  Yeah.  Right.  He's just got that crappy voice and everything.  He's pretty good.  I'm talking more like David Lee Roth and Whoopi Goldberg.  And there's a whole list of other, you know, big celebrities that have tried radio.  And they just can't get it done.  They can do it for like two, three weeks.  And then they realize, holy crap, I have nothing else to talk about.  And it's a lot of work.  And it's a lot of work.  And I don't feel like working hard at anything, especially radio. 
[00:33:30]  I don't feel like getting up at four in the morning to do this.  Actors used to have a lot of downtime.  Right.  It's going to be another disaster.  How is Whoopi going to fit in any of the celebrity shindigs in the evening when she's got to  wake up at an ungodly hour to do morning radio?  And it's another dopey radio station that just says, no, all you have to do is show up.  We got a radio guy in there.  All you have to do is show up, turn the mic on, and just ride it out with them. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, that's it.  That's all you got to do.  It's easy.  You guys want to hear some Whoopi in the morning?  All right.  Here we go.  Here was their big promo that was stating that Whoopi was coming to town.  Right.  Philly, you're so lucky you don't have to listen to this drivel.  They do on our show, though, now.  Well, yeah.  We share.  Oh, we want to share with the rest of America how awful this is.  So this was the teaser promo.  Okay, you know, when a radio station changes or they're bringing in a new personality, 
[00:34:30]  they got to build the excitement.  The excitement must build.  This is how they were building the excitement for Whoopi coming to town.  How excited am I that we are in KTU?  I love this station.  I love it.  It's the premium dance station in the country.  We are building a new morning show.  That's right.  You and me, baby.  You and me.  Pass me that jackhammer.  That's it?  What happened?  Is that it, really?  It could have just been it.  Is that real?  The end.  No, no.  No?  Yeah, that's it.  Pass me that jackhammer. 
[00:35:00]  Because they're building.  It didn't crap out, sorry.  No, it didn't crap out.  That's it.  All right.  That's it.  The CD has paid.  Yeah.  That's it.  They sound very excited.  They're building a new station or a new show, so hand me that jackhammer.  They love the station, building a new morning show with a jackhammer.  All right.  Here's some more audio of Whoopi in the Morning here in New York City.  Good morning, everybody who is within the sound of my voice. 
[00:35:30]  Woo.  It took a while to get here.  It took a while to get here and to get up and running.  Now, Cubby, they heard you before they knew it was you, so say good morning to the nice people.  Well, it's a pleasure to be a part of this show.  Paul Cubby Bryant, you might have heard my name, probably not on the level as Whoopi Goldberg.  You're kind of like a worldwide superstar, but I've been in New York radio almost 10 years, and wow, we are on the radio.  We've been talking about this for how long?  For about 17 minutes. 
[00:36:00]  And the last 17 minutes have been sort of countdown, and it's like, what's going to happen?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  All right.  You want to cut a root for a little bit.  Yeah, a little, like, even as a competitor, you know, which I don't really consider a competitor.  This is just another show that's not, I doubt we're going to be sharing much of an audience.  She's going to be talking to the shwoogies.  Jesus Christ.  But Cubby sounds like I sounded on Opie's old B.A.B. show, just laughing at everything and happy to be there. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, just a little overenthusiastic.  A little overenthusiastic that he's there with the whoopster, if I may call her the whoopster.  I'm hoping he does that.  But he just sounds a little too happy to be there.  And I know there's a clip coming up where he almost comes off like a step and fetch it, like he's like a punching bag.  I think this is the clip right here. 
[00:37:00]  Whoopi has no buttons to push.  Uh-huh.  More terrific audio from their show this morning.  I have to tell you all who are listening, there's all kinds of things that can happen this morning.  Things could just go drop out.  You don't know what's going to happen.  Plus, it's our first day.  Do you know how many wrong buttons I'm going to hit?  I hope not very many after you bragged about being so famous in New York for being on the radio.  If you do that, if you drop the thing, they're going to expect me to make a mistake.  You cannot make any mistakes because now we already know about you. 
[00:37:30]  Little do they know, though, you have no buttons in front of you.  All you've got to worry about is talking.  I do not need a button in front of me.  I don't need anything that I can get in trouble with in front of me.  See, that's exactly what we're saying.  Yeah.  The management of KTU said, look, all you have to do is show up.  You don't have to do.  Just show up.  You just show up.  When's the show on?  You just show up like five minutes before showtime, enough to sit down, and then you leave right afterwards.  Everyone else will take care of everything.  You've just got to talk. 
[00:38:00]  We'll just talk about your life experiences.  People are going to want to talk to you.  They're going to call you up and ask you things.  Okay, that's week one.  Now what?  Talk about being in the movies.  Oh, and for anybody thinking, well, how do you know?  Because we've just seen it too many times.  We just saw it with David Lee Roth.  The guys in the NAMM, the soldiers that were in the NAMM doing their second tour.  You think when those newbies, that fresh meat came off the planes, they didn't look at them 
[00:38:30]  and know exactly what was going to happen to each and every one of them?  Of course they did.  When you're in the trenches.  We've seen it before.  That's why we know.  Someone is saying on the instant feedback, what virus is whoopee spreading?  Sickle cell?  Oh, I didn't say it.  Look.  Or they came up with the other one that, thank God, I don't need to know about.  Where is it?  What is that? 
[00:39:00]  I might even pronounce it a bit wrong because I might.  Tay-Sachs?  Never heard of it.  Tay-Sachs?  Tay-Sachs?  The hell is that?  I don't know.  Someone that's, uh...  Sure it's not a joke?  Someone that's up on their black diseases.  It's T-A-Y-S-A-C-H-S.  Let's look that up.  All right.  Here we go.  More audio from Whoopee in the Morning.  One of the things that I want to talk about right now is the fact that it is the coolest  day of the year today at a high of 90. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, I know.  I don't understand.  But tomorrow and Wednesday, temperatures near 100.  And then you add the humidity, it's going to feel like 110.  Is that bad?  That's not good.  You know, look, all you have to do is stay cool.  Now, do you know things to use and take care of yourself like that?  Because you are very...  I won't say very pale, but people can't see you.  But you are definitely of a hue that needs some, you know, protection.  Right.  And meanwhile, she's walking around the station with a basket on her head. 
[00:40:00]  Why are they going to be playing that stupid music underneath everything?  That's awful and distracting.  That's just, you know, to jazz it up.  Do they play music?  I don't know.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, they talk.  Yeah?  There's a little bit of talking.  A fan.  Yeah, it's like, it sounds like they talk maybe 10 minutes per hour, 10 to 15 minutes per hour.  Man.  And they were giving like heat.  Remember those days?  They were giving heat tips and all that crap.  Yeah, heat tips. 
[00:40:30]  And here's some sunscreen talk from Whoopi in the Morning.  All right.  Do they have like a new sunscreen that's like, it's like 100 proof or something like that?  Or is it an amazing sunscreen?  Even I will use the sunscreen.  Whoopi Goldberg will use it?  I will use the sunscreen because, you know, the truth of the matter is the sun really will  wear you down.  And this is a great sunscreen.  Sun is great.  You see what's happening.  Yep.  My new teeth.  I got them just for the radio.  They are loose.  And they are moving around in my mouth.  And I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them. 
[00:41:00]  Hurry on.  Hurry on.  Copy.  Copy.  Copy.  Copy.  Copy.  Copy.  Copy.  Copy.  Copy.  Copy.  That's pretty hot the way you do that.  The way you adjust them.  Holy crap.  Granted, it's their first show.  Granted.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You always got to maybe give the benefit of the doubt when it's.  But she's too big of a star for them to be doing a lot of practice shows.  And she's too big of a star for her to actually hang out with Cubby.  Yeah.  This is just going to fall flat on its face.  I've heard funnier eulogies. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, Cubby's going to call her at home.  Hey, we got to do a little show prep.  Yeah, screw that.  I got to call Ted Danson.  She's not going to have the time or the energy to get this show going.  No.  Good luck.  I would like to predict four weeks, but they're going to commit to it for a while.  Yeah, they got to give them some time.  By the end of the year, goodbye.  Goodbye to Whoopi in the Morning.  And this, it's the kiss of death when Ovi gives it.  Seen it before.  Kiss of death. 
[00:42:00]  How much time you give?  Well, I don't think it should be on more than a month.  Yeah.  But, you know, they probably committed.  So probably the end of the year, unfortunately.  Probably right around Christmas would be a good time when everyone's too busy, you know,  Christmas shopping to worry about their favorite radio show.  I would love to say four weeks, dude.  Yeah.  I would love to, but no way.  But no, no, no way.  Too much invested.  Well, it's Manners Monday on the Whoopi in the Morning show. 
[00:42:30]  So I'm just going to salute those guys who, guys and gals actually, who ride around, who  take care of us in the emergency services.  I think they're terrific.  When I see them, I'm going to wave to them.  That's awesome.  So there wasn't an emergency going on.  They just helped her out.  They just helped.  That's cool.  They just helped for no reason.  And that's the one thing we want to really, you know, talk about how this show is going  to be.  This show is all about good things.  Talking about stuff like that.  Talking about Manners. 
[00:43:00]  This show is going to be about talking about good things.  You're finished.  Good things.  That's what people want to hear.  People want good things.  It's Smile Tuesday, everybody.  Make sure you smile at your fellow New Yorker today.  Don't forget.  Stupid music is so distracting.  Stuff like that.  Talking about Manners.  Can we make today Manners Monday?  Today is already Manners Monday, but you know that you have the sheet in front of you. 
[00:43:30]  I was trying to act like I just thought of it.  You are so funny.  Listen, y'all need to call us at 1-800-449-8686.  Uh-oh.  Cindy has got your first look at traffic next on KTU.  We're here.  I say 103.5.  She did not just give out the phone number to the O&A pass, did she?  Oh, no.  1-800-449-8686.  Oh, did that just happen?  Why don't you welcome Whoopi to New York Radio.  Give her a little welcome. 
[00:44:00]  I'm sure she'd love to hear from the likes of Ramon or a few other characters.  You got someone from Yellowstone on the phone.  Frank the Frowner perhaps might want to get through.  There's so many people.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, all right.  Here's the first caller to the Whoopi in the Morning show.  The first caller I want to talk to is Danny from EA.  What line is he on?  He's on line one. 
[00:44:30]  Line number one.  That's why he's the first caller.  Danny, are you there?  Hello.  Good morning.  Good morning, Danny.  Whoopi, it's a pleasure to speak to you, Whoopi.  Thank you, honey.  You know you're our very first caller.  You should go into our caller hall of fame.  That's going to last.  That's great to know.  It's a two-hour drive for you.  Are you coming in or going out of the city?  I'm coming into the city.  I actually moved to the Poconos about six years ago.  Excellent.  And I've been doing this commute for the last six years.  And I've always been trying to get into the station. 
[00:45:00]  And today is a pleasure that I'm getting to the first time in.  Excellent.  Well, I'll tell you, we are thrilled that you called us up.  Shut up.  We want to tell you that we're going to be here every morning to help you with that ride.  We're going to be telling you good stuff.  And we're going to be giving you a big hug on your way in.  Big hug.  But we have nothing for you for being the first caller.  That's right.  I'm sorry.  Shut up.  Huge gratitude.  But you got to talk to Whoopi Goldberg.  How cool is that?  Holy crap.  This is going to be a disaster. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  What a stupid beat that keeps playing.  I can't get over how awful.  Over the caller.  You can't hear anything that's going on.  All you hear is that dumb beat.  People are saying that's the music from Madagascar.  Is it?  And supposedly that's.  This is Brian from St. Louis.  Hey guys, how fitting is it that the music they're playing is the music from Madagascar 
[00:46:00]  when the monkey things are dancing?  Oh, come on now.  That's what he's saying, man.  I just read him.  Here's what I think of Whoopi.  Goddamn rich horse.  All right, here we go.  This was the one that made us really laugh and realize that she has absolutely nothing.  But I just wanted to make sure that she went to the movies.  I went to the movies.  Because you told me to.  You gave me a look, Friday, like if you don't go to the movies, Cubby, I'm going to whip you. 
[00:46:30]  Well, that's all this is about.  Role reversal.  It's me ordering you to do things that I don't have to do.  Would you like breakfast now?  I'll be more than happy to get it for you.  Well, I know that.  But when I'm ready, Cubby, I will send you off.  Did you know that today, as we said, is a good manners day?  Do you know what the thing I want to talk about the next few seconds are?  I'm guessing good manners.  Good manners.  Please and thank you.  You don't hear that enough.  No, you don't.  And you know something?  When we come back, because we're getting ready to go into a break, we're going to talk about you seeing the movie. 
[00:47:00]  We're going to talk about manners.  We're going to tell people what time it is.  We're just going to take people where they need to go.  Good morning.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You stink.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Please and thank you.  Wow.  If you put a gun in your mouth, I'll say, please pull the trigger.  And after you do, I'll say, thank you.  Wow.  Wow.  I kind of feel bad for Cubby. 
[00:47:30]  I never thought I'd say that.  Guy in the business, 10 years, you know.  And she's not going to take any direction from anybody.  No, no.  She is so effed.  And he's got to play the punching bag, I guess.  You know.  Oh, boy.  She thinks, like, having Manners Monday and having a nice show is going to get the job done.  See, everybody.  Especially in New York.  Are you kidding?  Everyone can be mean or a shock jock, Opie. 
[00:48:00]  See, that's probably, they sat down like, look, everyone else out there is doing the shock jock thing.  Why don't we do the other thing, the complete opposite?  Why?  We'll be your friendly radio show.  Because that's why shows like Rescue Me get an audience and get the people talking about it.  And get people watching Lucky Louie, The Sopranos, Deadwood, things like that.  And nice, wholesome shows end up on obscure channels like ABC Family. 
[00:48:30]  And Lifetime.  Ushered off to Lifetime and things like that.  Old series that couldn't make it.  Oh, because people are vicious by nature.  They don't want it, they don't really want it thrown at them.  But they kind of like seeing people slip and fall.  They like seeing people get hurt.  They like when the news is bad, especially in other countries where it doesn't involve us.  It makes it interesting.  It gives people things to talk about.  Hey, did you hear what happened?  Horrible accident. 
[00:49:00]  It was just the worst thing.  Yeah.  No one likes nice things unless it's happening to them directly.  But no one wants to hear about it.  No one wants Manners Monday.  Jay, we should try Manners Monday a little with our callers at Opie.  Because I noticed you're a little mean to our callers.  If that guy called up, that called up would be showing and talked about which way he drives in or out.  You're driving east or west because this is fascinating.  How long is your commute?  Instead of going boring and hanging up on him, perhaps we should entertain the call and have some manners. 
[00:49:30]  Today should be Manners Monday.  Today, I agree.  I think we should steal that bit immediately.  Oh, exactly.  I think this should be a more upbeat, positive show.  Because when someone says they're from Pennsylvania and you say, do you drive in and out of the city?  That's a good question.  It is.  Paying attention.  Right.  I'm glad you concur.  Thank you, Jimmy.  What chemistry between those two?  It's just magic.  And asking someone how long.  Bleach and ammonia.  Asking how long someone's commute is.  Yeah.  Especially, it's at least an hour. 
[00:50:00]  Of course.  At least an hour.  All you need to know.  Probably two hours each way, every day, whoopee.  It's miserable.  Because we're regular people.  We have to drive through this horse ass.  But where are you going to go with the answer?  No matter what he says, you can't make it interesting.  No.  Because ten minutes or four hours, you're like, oh, okay.  Oh.  There's nowhere to go with that.  It's a complete dead-end question.  Well, Anthony in New York, what do you got?  Did you guys catch that part of her shtick was, when we come back, we'll tell you the 
[00:50:30]  time?  Yeah.  That was part of her bit, which is just...  Do you realize that?  That was a tease, by the way.  People, when you tease when you're going into break, you're supposed to be telling people  something that's going to hold them through the commercials.  Breaking down Opie's 13th wall of radio here.  Right.  You're supposed to be telling them something that's going to go, ooh, you know, I might want  to hear that.  The time?  Don't look at your clocks, people.  Don't look at any clocks in your car.  Don't look down at your radio, because there's a clock there. 
[00:51:00]  I want to be the one that tells you the time.  Don't spoil my bit and look at the time in the car.  I'll tell you the time.  Because then you can change the station.  Right.  Holy tool.  That's like when we do a radio tease going into break.  Yeah.  And you're able to look at your radio dial, and it tells exactly what we're going to  do after the break.  That's what she just did.  Because as soon as you say time, wouldn't you pop your head up and go, hey, what time  is it?  What time is it?  By the way, what time is it?  Let me look down.  And you don't tease the time.  Well, I know what time it is.  Don't have to listen to this horse crap after the break. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, wow.  That is brutal stuff, man.  Well, I hope it gets better for them.  We'll take our competition very seriously.  Yes.  I think we should check back with them after they've been on the air for a little while.  You think?  Like maybe tomorrow.  Yeah.  Or maybe by the end of their show.  And to combat manners Monday, let's bring Mel Gibson on tomorrow and have Jews Tuesday.  Yeah.  Here's the difference between the two shows.  After the break, here's a good radio tease.  We get into the Mel Gibson stuff. 
[00:52:00]  That's not very nice, though.  The manners Monday.  Yeah, well.  I don't think we should go through Mel Gibson.  Whoopi's doing nice radio.  So I don't think she's going to be touching on the Mel Gibson drunk driving story from over  the weekend.  No.  But we will in its entirety.  Or she'll hit it with club music under it.  Is he crazy?  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,  bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  What?  That's not very nice.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  What did Whoopi say?  What?  All right.  And if you're just tuning in, we announced that the ONA virus is spreading to Chicago and 
[00:52:30]  San Francisco starting tomorrow.  And we were talking about that disco demolition thing.  Well, the pictures are now linked on opiananthony.com.  What happened to the potatoes?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  From ONA Pictures.  You always like potatoes.  That's not new.  A horrifying story.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Of a man.  I need the potatoes.  Without potatoes.  Danny, you forget the potatoes?  It won't happen again.  I can promise you it.  How far will one man go?  Well, I'm going to have to wait for the potatoes.  For potatoes. 
[00:53:00]  The Potato Diva.  My potatoes are here.  Come here.  Open your mouth.  Eat.  Eat.  Eat your potatoes.  That's the way to do it.  You say potato.  He says potato.  That's a big thing in potatoes, Danny.  Everything is delicious.  The Potato Diva.  I need the potatoes.  Yeah.  Coming soon.  I want potatoes, and I want eggs, and I want hot sauce.  God, you've gotten fat.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:53:30]  We've got a very busy week, by the way.  We're heading to Boston on, I guess, Thursday, after Thursday's show.  Broadcasting live from WBCN in Boston.  We're expecting a lot of listeners to show up at the station.  We're going to have O&A Traveling Virus t-shirts.  O&A Traveling Virus tickets to give away outside the station.  Other prizes.  Supposedly, BCN's going to try to make it a really, really big deal.  Nice. 
[00:54:00]  While we're there.  So, make sure you join us if you're in the area.  Friday morning at WBCN in Boston.  And then, of course, we do the O&A Traveling Virus thing that Saturday.  This coming Saturday at the DCU Center in Worcester.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info on our O&A Traveling Virus thing is up on O.B. and Anthony.com.  Don't forget, it's sponsored by Bud Light.  Or Bud Light presents the O.B. and Anthony Traveling Virus.  The comedy event of 2006. 
[00:54:30]  And Bud Light, always worth it.  All right?  Right.  There you have it.  Where were we going with the story of the weekend?  Mel Gibson?  Let's get right into it.  Love him.  He's out of his mind.  Lost his mind.  He is truly Mad Max.  Driving around.  Thinking about the Jews.  I love when these Hollywood guys get caught, man. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Because they got publicists around them.  They try to protect them all the time.  He went through all that with The Passion of the Christ.  All that anti-Jew thing.  They said the movie was very anti-Jewish.  And the publicist spun it, no, you know, Mel isn't like that.  He got a few beers in him.  Got pulled over.  And just started spouting.  Boy, you say some dumb things when you're drunk.  Don't you?  Yeah, but to a cop, are you a Jew? 
[00:55:30]  What is that?  I don't know.  Wait.  He's obsessed with the Jews.  The thing is, that just shows you how crazy he is about the Jews.  Yeah, when he's not walking the red carpet or doing those dumb interviews on TV, this  is how he really thinks.  It's all about the Jews.  Right.  Oh.  So he was really, really hammered, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Pretty hammered.  They said that they pulled him over.  Noticed him weaving around a little bit.  Pulled him over.  He got out of the car.  And started talking about how effed he was going to be. 
[00:56:00]  Because the guy said, you're under the influence.  Going to have to take you in.  So they were cutting him some slack by saying, look, no handcuffs.  Just cooperate with us.  And he's like, you don't understand how effed I am.  And as they tried to put him into the car in a scene right out of cops, which I want to  see the dash cam of this, Mel tries to make a break for us.  He did not.  Yes.  He runs.  Tries to run from the cop. 
[00:56:30]  What, is he going to hide under a kiddie pool?  He's Mel Gibson, too.  Like, what are you going to do?  Where can I find Mel Gibson?  You know, it's not like he's going to disappear.  I'm going to call Roger Murtaugh.  Stupid Mel.  Getting too old for this.  Yeah, he tries to run quickly.  Quickly apprehended.  Imagine though he's hiding under the kiddie pool.  They're like, Mel, we saw you go under the kiddie pool.  Yeah, what do you want?  We know who you are and we know where you're at.  He's hiding in a closet.  What?  What?  Doing like they do on cops. 
[00:57:00]  What?  What?  No, I'm just, I'm in here.  What are you doing?  I'm just searching the closet for Jews.  I wasn't doing anything wrong.  I love this stuff.  Looking for Anne Frank.  Because, you know, we put all these people on a pedestal and you realize they're just like you and I.  They're regular people.  Only, you know, his choice of ethnicity to bash is different than maybe yours or mine or Jimmy's or.  Yes, when you're in Hollywood, ixnay on the Jew bashing a stupid ass. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, man, that is not smart.  Well, he wasn't able to get backing for passion.  Yeah.  So he had to pull out all the money out of his own pocket because the Jews, I guess, for.  And this is another thing with Hollywood.  For years, the insiders all know what's going on.  When the news breaks enough where the public knows, then all the Hollywood insiders go.  We knew this about this guy for years.  So he wasn't able to get backing for his movie because he kind of people knew about his anti-Semitic ideology stance. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, so he bankrolled the movie himself and lucky for him, it made a fortune.  And, you know, he's rich, didn't need a single Jew.  And that was that.  But now it came out, yeah, he really has these feelings.  Well, let's get right into it.  This is from CNN.  I'm sure it gets even saltier.  But CNN has to play it safe, I guess.  Did we get through the whole thing, though?  The cops apprehended him after he tried to bolt?  Well, you studied this story over the weekend, so you could add in the stuff they didn't add to the CNN. 
[00:58:30]  Okay, we'll see what they got.  Because I don't think they got the sugar blank line.  Yeah, that's a great one.  All right, here's the audio from CNN.  Reverberations from Gibson's arrest are spreading through Los Angeles.  Now the L.A. County Sheriff's Department is embroiled in reports.  They gave Gibson preferential treatment after he was arrested early Friday morning in Malibu, California,  on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. 
[00:59:00]  The entertainment news website, TMZ.com, reports authorities altered the arresting deputies' handwritten report,  allegedly removing offensive comments Gibson made when he was arrested.  TMZ alleges Gibson spewed obscenities and hurled sexist and anti-Semitic statements, including, quote,  effing Jews?  The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.  Gibson then, according to TMZ, turned to the deputy and asked, quote,  are you a Jew?  Are you a Jew? 
[00:59:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I do love the fact, though, that the outrage in this country isn't about the fact that he probably could have killed someone.  Right, driving drunk.  He had just run over the eight-year-old, pulling the ribbon out of the back of the rear wheel.  But then he said something.  The pink patent leather buckle shoe.  That's the last time kids wore ribbons, though.  I don't know.  But it makes a great image in the grill.  It does, it does.  Hey, let's say hi to April. 
[01:00:00]  Was that kid a Jew?  Let's say hi to April in the Bronx.  April.  Hi.  Hi, April.  How are you guys?  Good.  We want a quick call here.  Let's go.  Okay.  I saw you guys were on break.  I flipped over to KCU.  And one of your pests got through.  And they dropped the ONA name.  And Cubby's like, oh, they just mentioned another DJ.  And Whoopi's like, what?  What's that about?  He's like, oh, they're going to a bad place.  And it was just like the weirdest thing. 
[01:00:30]  Oh.  Really awkward.  Let's get the call.  We'll have the call in a little while.  Thank you.  Oh, good.  The pests are getting through at a Whoopi show.  What's that number again?  1-800-449-8686.  Thanks, April.  God, why do we love doing this so much?  We love the pests.  We don't have manners on Monday.  First day.  We can't assume anything.  We got to attack immediately.  Right away.  Right away.  Poor Cubby.  Like the Israelis.  Let's just start the bombing immediately.  We don't care.  We don't need any info. 
[01:01:00]  Anyone in the way.  Children.  Right.  Doesn't matter.  That's right.  I just want to lay on top of Cubby.  I can't say that.  Poor Cubby.  Oh, it's another show.  Now he's got to explain.  Now you know Cubby's all like hot and nervous that these calls are going to get through.  Because our listeners are professional pests.  That's right.  They really know how to get past screeners.  They're very, very good.  And it's really funny.  I'm sorry. 
[01:01:30]  It's very funny.  Let's say hi to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I heard they had to take in Gibson when he failed to goose up a straight line.  Oh, there you go.  Bravo.  Ah, damn it.  That's funny.  Yeah, but this is a nice, guys.  It's Manners Monday.  Hey, he did not see the cop.  Oh, okay.  Takes a little while.  All right, here we go.  More weight.  And he was going to give him a drink.  He said, I'd offer you a drink. 
[01:02:00]  That's right.  Little wordplay jokes, folks.  Elbow, elbow.  Hey, I came close to her, but it's not like a Hitler.  All right.  It's a reach.  They got the job done, though.  You're not going to hear this on Whoopi Show.  If you want nice radio, tune in to KTU.  They're just nice all over the place for you.  Of course they are.  I just thought of a line so bad, I gave myself the douche chip.  Oh, no.  But you have to say it.  I can't do it.  The Hitler line wasn't bad. 
[01:02:30]  Good point.  He actually said to his friend when he was really drunk, I'm really blitzed, Craig.  That's funny.  That's all right.  What's wrong with that?  Craig, Craig, it works.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  More Mel Gibson audio.  Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, will neither confirm  nor deny the reports of Gibson's alleged statements, but told CNN the arrest occurred without incident,  clarifying what that means.  Quote, every time somebody is arrested, something out of the ordinary happens, but guns don't 
[01:03:00]  always have to be drawn.  Without incident means without force.  He went on to say, there has been no cover-up by the Sheriff's Department.  Nothing has been sanitized.  The job of the L.A. County Sheriff's Department is not to focus on what he said or didn't say,  but to establish his blood alcohol level and concentrate on the facts.  Nothing has been cleansed.  Nothing has been cleansed.  Sanitized.  This is boring stuff. 
[01:03:30]  Well, he, um, they obviously cleaned it up and gave him preferential treatment, which  is fine, but he must have been such a dick that they said, we're just going to blow this  out and embarrass him.  Why else would they do it?  No, no.  What happened was, uh, they, they, they, uh, threw him in the cop car.  He started with this Jew bashing.  Uh, the arresting officer wrote up a report with everything in it.  Every slur he made, uh, about the Jews, the, uh, problems he had with him running away  from the scene. 
[01:04:00]  Well, he was also saying, I own Malibu.  Yeah.  He was just being such an obnoxious ass to the cops.  He said, you, you, you're effed.  I'm going to have your job.  I own Malibu.  I can buy you.  I have, I'm going to use all my money to bring you down.  Uh, then they bring him to the station.  He's, uh, sitting there just berating the police officers.  Uh, he had to use the, the men's room, um, and they wouldn't let him and he was handcuffed.  Uh, so he's trying to get his arms around to the front and they were, uh, a little scared 
[01:04:30]  that he was going to reach his zipper and make a mess all over the holding cell.  So they led him to the bathroom and, uh, you gotta let him just, you gotta let him just  stand there and stain himself and then photograph it.  There's Mel Gibson.  There's Mel Gibson with a puddle.  So they let him do that.  Standing in a puddle.  Standing in a puddle.  How funny would that be?  That would be really funny.  Just a big dark stain on his, uh, jeans.  There's Mad Max on a wheelie pad trying to call his wife in a blackout. 
[01:05:00]  A jackass.  Well then, uh, he said, I want my phone call.  So they brought him to a pay phone or the phone that they use and he took it off the  wall and it didn't work.  So he started smashing it against the wall and they informed him that he was going to  be charged with more crimes if he broke the phone.  Um, then a woman officer walks in and it's Mel Gibson sitting there.  So she looks at him, maybe a little too long because Mel decided to turn around and say,  what the heck, what the F are you looking at? 
[01:05:30]  Sugar teas.  That's the proper way to address a female police officer to get the proper, uh, respect to  give the proper respect to her.  Here's Gibson's apology, I guess.  Gibson released a lengthy statement through his publicist Saturday, calling his behavior  belligerent and saying, quote, I acted like a person completely out of control when I was  arrested and set things that I do not believe to be true and which are despicable. 
[01:06:00]  I apologize to anyone who I have offended.  I disgraced myself and my family with my behavior and for that, I am truly sorry.  And the Jews suck.  Yeah, I just wanted to add that in.  I just want to go to the beach and fly a kike.  I'm really depressed.  We have an update.  TJ in Atlanta.  TJ.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Uh, they're already getting to the point where they're not taking calls.  They're just taking questions to ask whoopie on air.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:06:30]  It's just, oh, no.  You feel bad?  Sister Act 2.  Keep calling.  Oh, no.  She's hurt us enough.  Oh, no.  And I like whoopie Goldberg.  I don't hate her at all.  I like her.  Wreck her.  Just keep it going.  Sister Act 2.  Oh, no.  Keep going, people.  Pretty much, uh, they're inviting the Pest to call every day now.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  How is she going to talk to her listeners if the Pest are getting through every day?  I think we can take over her show.  Because, you know, she wants to have that feel like she's one with the people. 
[01:07:00]  Right.  Bring the people in.  And it's nice.  And this is our show.  There's too much negativity out there.  This is going to be a nice radio show.  So, you've got to have callers.  Give me a call and tell me how you're beating the heat.  Yeah.  Or how you're dealing with the commute.  Or who you're smiling at today.  Oh, God.  Who made you smile today on your way into work?  That's my whoopie question for the day.  Opie and Anthony did while they were making fun of the Jews.  Well, there was this guy I know at work. 
[01:07:30]  We call him Frank the Frowner.  And he's usually sad.  And whoopie, today I was able to smile.  Ramon!  Oh, it's going to be ugly fast.  Oh, boy.  Poor Cubby.  Oh, poor, poor Cubby.  Well, thanks for that update.  We've already wrecked their show.  And finally, here's the last clip from the Mel Gibson drunk driving thing.  Hmm.  Anti-Defamation League issued a statement Sunday saying Gibson's apology was, quote, 
[01:08:00]  unremorseful and insufficient.  They went on to say it does not go to the essence of his bigotry and his anti-Semitism.  Which goes much deeper.  The ADL is responding to reports that Gibson allegedly made anti-Semitic remarks,  allegations Gibson did not directly address in his statement.  Gibson's publicist, Alan Nirob, told CNN on Sunday he didn't comment  about the alcohol rehabilitation program,  nor would he address whether Gibson made anti-Semitic remarks during his arrest. 
[01:08:30]  He said Gibson's statement speaks for itself.  Hum, hum, Ed Norton's a Jew.  Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.  Is he going to go to AA, Adolph Anonymous?  They're all raising their hands straight out to the right.  Does that make sense?  That's no word.  Yes.  I saw it.  It was a nice visual.  It was a nice visual all the time.  It's good to be on the radio.  Wow.  So a lot of people, a lot of mixed reaction from Hollywood. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, of course.  Some people are saying, ah, the guy's got a problem.  He's got a drinking problem.  Others, you know, I'm sure somebody like Spielberg, not too happy with him.  Katzenberg?  Katzenberg.  Any Berg?  Not too happy with the guy.  Yeah, the Berg's aren't happy.  Weinstein?  Probably not happy.  The Steens and the Berg's.  Steens, the Berg's.  And don't think that if they get angry enough in Hollywood that they can't just wreck you  and guarantee the theaters don't carry your stuff. 
[01:09:30]  Of course.  Yeah, they can, if they get mad enough, they can say, if you carry any of this guy's stuff,  you're not getting this or that.  Yeah.  That sounded like a real insider talk, didn't it?  What a dope, what a water cooler dummy I am.  What are you, a Jew?  Just, but that was the biggest non-contribution.  Nah, but dude, they can just, those guys, you're really stupid.  Who?  I don't know.  I just heard once.  Speculative idiot.  It's Monday.  Thank you for your input, Jimmy.  Oh, that's true.  It doesn't matter.  Being polite.  Yeah, you gotta be more polite. 
[01:10:00]  I'm trying to politely slam my flace in the...  Oh, yeah.  Take your flace and slam it, you babbling idiot.  I really am.  Just have no value.  This is the story of the little boy who cried fire.  Ah.  One day, this little boy found he had nothing to do.  So...  It's Jimmy's song.  Jimmy's song.  This was something, Jimmy, had talked about for so long.  When you were a kid, I guess, you remember this song.  Yeah, I remember when I was a kid, it was an anti, like, don't pull the fire alarm song. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  And it was just like the chorus kept running through my head.  I've always remembered.  I was probably six years old when I heard this, and I haven't heard it since.  And of course, I don't know where these...  Was it when you were under a porch, satisfying another young lad?  No, but I'm sure that's what I would do as I was going home and washing my own mouth out with soap  and just pretending that didn't happen.  This is the song I'd put on with a little record player needle to forget.  So this song might bring back some fine memories for you today, huh?  Well, I did hear it this weekend.  This is from 1969.  Okay, I was born in 68, so I was probably five years older. 
[01:11:00]  Little Jimmy with a clothes-in-play.  One of those little clothes-in-play record players.  But I didn't realize the obvious sexual orientation of this person until I just heard this recently.  Oh, really?  It seems there was a fire.  Fire.  When do you hear the fire engine sound?  It's awful.  It's a little boy.  We're going to play it after the break.  The song is like six minutes long.  I don't play all of it.  Yeah, it's just...  We can play a little at the beginning.  It's like the Inna Gata DeVita of kids' songs.  Inna Gata DeVita. 
[01:11:30]  I'm sure it probably goes like repeats itself a few times.  Oh, yeah.  It's very repetitious, most kids' songs are.  So we fast-forward, get the gist of it, go to the end, see what the payoff is.  Yeah, we'll check it out.  We'll figure it out next.  It's the ONA virus.  And the time.  And the time.  I want to give the time when we get back.  Time coming up right now.  Well, we'll tell you when we get back.  We don't know what time it is.  Someone commented, I saw that their watch was broken and they were driving.  Right.  And very upset that we didn't give the time and they wanted to know where they could tune in to find out what time it is. 
[01:12:00]  We can't give the time.  We can say...  Because sometimes the show's on different.  So many minutes after the hour.  Do you know someone right now in Cleveland is listening to this in the afternoon?  Now you're going to make me give the time before the break.  I'll just say it's 27 minutes past the hour.  Ah, look at you.  Like a national guy.  I never knew why they did that until someone told me.  And they're like, oh, yeah, it makes sense.  Like, I didn't hear it intuitively.  No, that makes sense.  Really?  Yeah.  That there's different time zones.  Yeah.  Maybe I was itching my face.  Ugh.  Wait. 
[01:12:30]  Fat-faced pig.  All right.  We'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  And starting tomorrow, it spreads to Chicago and San Francisco.  Call the O.P. and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  ONA, who's this?  Hi.  I'm Tony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So, why'd you call?  The man on the radio said I should call.  Oh, fantastic.  Hang on.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the O.P. and Anthony Show 
[01:13:00]  at 866-313-FREE.  Okay.  Bye.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  And welcome back.  O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got to get all our Robert Reed jokes in today. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All our little Robert Reed references.  He says, no.  Stop.  He's a hero there in San Francisco.  We can talk about him.  Tomorrow, this show gets much more interesting.  It's going to be heard in Chicago and San Francisco.  All we need is L.A.  And the comeback is complete.  Yep.  And everything else to me is gravy. 
[01:14:00]  I'll let you be nice, but.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  The good day New York pranksters are in-house.  We got them.  We had a lot of fun with this audio piece on Friday.  We'll get into that in a few minutes here.  Been watching the video like crazy on the internet.  It's hilarious.  One of the number one downloads.  On YouTube, right?  Yeah.  And we have it up on opiananthony.com as well.  She loses her mind.  You haven't seen it again?  No, I heard about it, but I got a link to it.  Scream, man.  And then it turns out. 
[01:14:30]  I thought she was in on the gag, to be honest with you.  No.  Just how she acts and stuff.  But then you realize she really isn't.  She's just a tool.  What is it?  Jody Applegate?  Yeah, Jody Applegate.  And then you realize the paper said yesterday.  They realized why she was so upset.  Or Saturday.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Why?  She's pregnant.  She's with child.  So she got all fighting.  So she got the children.  All of a sudden, she went into mommy mode.  Then stay in the studio.  Exactly.  Oh, she was out of the studio?  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  She was on the street.  These guys pulled a fast one on her.  That's where it would have been tragic if that grinder would have flung out of the guy's  hand and hit her right in the lower abdomen.  Actually, why don't we play the clip real fast?  Set up the boys.  Again, their paperwork done.  But I guess it turns out they're huge fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  Bravo, guys.  I watch this thing now.  As soon as I saw the video, I'm like, that seems like someone that might be fans of our  radio show.  These look like a couple of ours. 
[01:15:30]  That's right.  The video is hilarious.  Here's the audio for you guys.  But if you haven't yet, check out the video on YouTube or opianthony.com, okay?  All right.  Show us how.  I guess we should set this up once again.  We've played this probably 10 times already.  We can't get enough of it.  But basically, these two guys, they filmed some kind of video about how easy it is to  steal bikes in New York and stuff.  Yeah.  And then they got the attention of Fox 5 News here in New York City. 
[01:16:00]  Fox 5.  So they decided to do a little piece on the streets of New York.  So they got a bike.  It's chained up with one of those really thick chains.  Heavy chain, yeah.  And the guys are on the street to show you how easy it is to steal a bike and how most  people, even if you're sawing through a chain, you know, won't help you out.  Yeah.  Won't call the police, whatever.  They just assume it's part of living in New York.  I'm looking at this phony bitch get upset.  She is so.  I haven't even heard the audio yet.  I guarantee she'll hide behind me while I'm pregnant.  Here's what bothered her.  The fact that her important piece was wrecked. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Her big story.  She really thought she was getting something done.  Exactly.  Sawing through a chain with a grinder.  So, yeah, they're sawing through and these guys kind of make a goof like one of them slit  their throats accidentally.  Oh, man.  We love when this happens to reporters.  That's what they really are.  Because they are useless.  Self-righteous idiot she is.  So she's not taken by the joke, but she's so upset that her audience might be taken by 
[01:17:00]  this ruse.  And the guy we like to call Jeff Spicoli just keeps saying it's a ruse.  It's a ruse.  It's a pothead.  He's like, it's a ruse.  It's a ruse.  And she's just yelling at him like a mad mommy.  Right, right.  Like you didn't clean up your room.  I bet you she's never yelled at a rape suspect or a child molester like that.  Oh, no.  Of course not.  You know, someone being born at the court with a jacket over his head because he molested  a kid.  They won't say anything to that guy.  But two guys mess up this self-righteous bitch's piece and all of a sudden she's upset. 
[01:17:30]  And it's not an important story.  She even says an important story.  It's not important.  It's not an important story.  It's a silly story.  Exactly.  It's a time filler.  It's a silly story because you can't talk about World War III intelligently.  Yeah.  That's why.  That's why you're on the street doing these dumb little pieces.  If you're over 15 and you have to worry about a bike getting stolen, walk home, faggot.  And this is why I'm proud to say that this show is different than almost every show on the 
[01:18:00]  dial.  Listen to this.  Eli, a guy.  Eli?  What's up?  It's Ellie.  What's up?  Ellie.  I'm sorry.  What's up, Ellie?  Not that much.  I was in the Z100 Friday afternoon and they were talking about it and they were saying  how despicable it was of these two guys to do.  It was just so funny.  Yeah, you know what else is despicable on Z100?  The way they dumped Christine and Aggie when she gave them all those great years of service.  That's right, Jim.  Thank you, buddy.  No problem, buddy.  Oh, apparently the pests have gotten to her. 
[01:18:30]  Why?  What happened?  Oh, boy.  What happened?  I think Ramon might have just called.  What happened?  Reports are coming in.  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  Let's see.  Wait, we got Lisa on the line.  She just heard it.  Lisa?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, what's up, Lisa?  Some guy comes in and says he's from Tony from Garden City, the EMS worker, and then  she starts screaming Ramon, and Whoopi gets all, like, indignant, saying, don't mess with  the EMS.  Don't use the EMS to get to my show.  All your radio shows are afraid of me. 
[01:19:00]  Yes.  Howard understands what I'm doing.  Howard, you're not worth the dust in Howard's shoes.  Don't mess with the EMS.  Yeah, she trashed us.  Oh, she got it?  She's saying, we're not worth the dust that Howard walks in, so she's trying to kiss Howard's  ass?  Oh, that's going to help you.  Speaking of dust, your show stinks, you ashy bitch.  It's awful.  Oh, Ramon got through.  Hold on.  Lisa is continuing here.  What, Lisa?  She goes, I have listeners, too, you know.  No, you don't. 
[01:19:30]  No, you don't.  You don't.  Bring them on.  If you want to defend Whoopi, call right now.  You don't have listeners.  Oh, is this funny.  Oh, this is going to be great.  Our first day, and we're ruining it.  No, no, no.  I love it.  No, it's great, too.  They're going to have to cover this in the paper.  Once again, these dopey papers are going to have to write about our show.  Spell it right.  P-E-S-T-S.  That's right.  Pests.  Pests.  That's what they are.  The pests are the ones that made it rough for Whoopi on our first day.  Oh, she does have listeners, I'm sure.  Every radio station has a listener. 
[01:20:00]  There's a couple of them.  But there's no other show in America that has pests.  Not pests.  Trust me on that.  Oh, you trust me on that.  You magnificent bastards.  Now that you acknowledge the pests, Whoopi, you're in deep, deep trouble.  Turn it up a notch, boys.  That's right.  Turn it up.  We don't have listeners.  We have tumors with teeth.  1-800-449-8686 if you want to talk to Whoopi.  Whoopi in the morning.  How many got through so far?  Two or three? 
[01:20:30]  I'm not sure.  Oh, that's great.  I haven't gotten an official report.  Get me the phone call.  The fog of war is still settling over the battlefield.  If someone has the first phone call that got through, please send it immediately to steve at foundrymusic.com.  What are you going to do to get at us?  Sing the song from Sister Act?  I don't know.  Her listeners may start calling up.  So if we hear like so-and-so from the color purple, don't go to it.  It's not our fans.  Lisa, thank you. 
[01:21:00]  You're welcome.  Sending up, guys.  Lakeisha is calling from the Bronx.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Should we take that phone call?  I say we do.  I'm not sure if it's one of ours.  I'm not sure if it's one of ours.  It's right on the fence.  Let's take our medicine.  All right.  Here's the audio from Good Day.  We're all over the ball field.  I'm so dumb.  I love these type of shows.  I'm so dumb.  I really thought a Lakeisha was on the phone.  I know you did, Jimmy.  People are laughing hysterically.  I'm that damn good.  It's like, oh, my God. 
[01:21:30]  She's not going to last until Friday.  Holy crap.  She cracked after only a few calls.  Yeah, because she wants people to respect her like they do when she's in Hollywood.  Go screw.  This is radio.  Instead of just like playing it off.  Go back to Hollywood, you bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get out of our business.  That's right.  And take that Mouseketeer's name faggot with you.  I'm sure Cubby's a good boy.  Nice.  Yeah, but you know what?  Collateral damage.  I know.  So I know sometimes, you know, when they set up those missiles next to the hospitals. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  All right.  My kid has to bite it.  Sometimes a grown man with mouse ears has to be raped along with you.  That's right.  Go back to Hollywood.  Oh, crank it up.  This is the real world, Toots.  Oh, someone's calling her a Ted Danson sea dumpster.  Oh, my God.  And as she was cleaning her hair out, he'd go, cheers.  Get it?  LOL. 
[01:22:30]  Look, the boys are excited.  Everyone's running around.  Oh, it is a lot of fun because it's her first day.  Yeah.  We've been waiting for this day since we started back on regular radio, commercial radio.  There's really been no one in New York to really jump on and not like it's a competition  thing because really, you know, playing music and stuff, I guess she's going to get whoever  wants to listen to the music.  But just to have someone new in town to just have our best go after is real fun. 
[01:23:00]  Because that's going to be the focus of the meeting after the show.  It's going to be like, yeah, good day, but it was just sullied.  Her first day was sullied.  How are we going to defend against this now?  They're going to need like a plan and the pests get through anything.  Believe me, if you're listening and you're involved with that show and you want to know  how to get around the pest, there really is no way.  It's like, this is what you do to Whoopi and Cubby.  You just go on the air every day and take your beating from the ONA pest. 
[01:23:30]  Just take it, take it, take it.  Don't react.  Don't show emotion.  Right.  And eventually they will get bored and they will move on to something else.  That's how it happens.  But she cracked like really quickly and easily.  Right.  Just go to town, guys.  It's a lot of fun.  I love reading the reports coming in.  Hey, someone from their mobile device.  As Whoopi went to break, she said, our thank you notes are lost art.  Let's talk about it next.  Oh, are you kidding? 
[01:24:00]  That's got to be a joke.  It has to be a joke.  No one actually even thought that, much less said it on a radio show.  Our thank you notes are lost art.  Yuck.  All right.  Here we go.  So now what are we going to do?  All right.  Why don't we do the Good Day New York pranksters?  So we kind of set it up.  Jody Applegate, local Fox, they were doing this piece on the street, how to get through  bike chains.  Yeah.  And the guy pulled a prank and basically made it look like his neck got slashed by the  tool they were using to go through the bike chain. 
[01:24:30]  Jody lost her mind.  Yeah.  Let's play the audio as we get the pranksters in here.  Z100 thought it was a bad, bad thing they did.  We think it was a great thing they did.  Z100 stinks.  Here we go.  Here's the clip that we've been playing like crazy.  All right.  Show us how unfortunately easy it is to do what you're going to do.  Tell us what that is.  All right.  So I have an angle grinder.  It's designed to cut metal.  And you plug this into the bottom of a light post.  Get on that.  Yeah.  Turn it on.  Yeah.  What Van's doing now is he's just cutting right through. 
[01:25:00]  The Van's cutting right through the chain here.  And if you look closely, you can see how it goes right through.  And you have to be very careful of these...  Cut it out.  Cut it out.  Stop that.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm fine.  You stopped.  I was just kidding.  No.  No.  It's okay.  It was just...  Take him stop. 
[01:25:30]  Take him stop.  No, no, no.  We were trying to do a serious thing here.  And this is not funny.  Do not be...  That's ketchup.  Do not be upset.  There are children watching.  That was not funny.  That's totally uncool.  Oh, we were just doing a rude.  And this is not planned.  No, we were just...  Not planned by me.  We were just doing a rude.  And I don't appreciate that on our show and our air.  Do not be upset.  That was a rude.  Oh, this is just tomato ketchup.  And we did not agree to that.  We'll be right back.  This is tomato ketchup.  Oh, don't be angry.  It's just merriment.  That was not cool, dude.  And then she gives you the thumbs. 
[01:26:00]  What'd you get out?  This is when she's yelling, stop, stop, stop.  She's punching Van.  Like, hard.  Punching him in the back.  Who was the one that said, it's just a ruse.  That was me.  That's great, dude.  Just a ruse.  It's just a ruse.  Just a ruse using some food.  Learning about Cuba.  Dude, that was so funny.  We've been laughing all weekend long because of you guys, man.  You know we hate the news, man.  It's just gotten to the point where they're so self-important.  And it's all such crap.  To see guys doing stuff like that, bravo. 
[01:26:30]  Thanks.  Well, did you see what the Daily News, the Daily News really tore into her.  They tore it to pieces.  Did they?  Yeah.  They did?  I brought you guys a copy.  What did they say?  What did they say?  They call her a hypocrite.  They say how all week long, all she's been saying apparently is that she wants to do something  so sensational she makes it on YouTube.  That was her goal all week long.  Richard Huff, maybe, because he did the piece.  Oh, let's get Richard Huff.  Let's get Richard Huff on the phone. 
[01:27:00]  He's a new friend.  Can we get him on immediately?  Yeah, see if we can't get him to talk about the Jody Applegate thing.  Yeah.  But can we tell you what happened after?  Yeah, that's what we want.  I want the whole...  Hold on.  You know, before that, we haven't played this second clip.  I guess later on in the show, she has more comments.  Oh, after the break.  Then she gets into some real news.  So let's play this clip.  Yeah, let's hear it.  More Jody Applegate.  Thank you, Stacey.  And did you see what happened down there?  Yeah, I did.  And Jody, I just want to say something.  I completely agree with what you're saying, because I have a four-year-old nephew that  watches the show all the time, and he gets pretty, pretty scared at the sight of whatever... 
[01:27:30]  Holy...  You're not going there!  Don't even say this.  They were showing Hezbollah rockets flying into Israel.  Of course, that kid is not going there.  They show dead children on the...  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Because I guess when it's real news, it's okay.  The four-year-old could figure all that out, right?  My four-year-old watches the show.  What kind of a boring nephew at four watches the news? 
[01:28:00]  What a douche this kid's going to be.  Mom?  Yeah, you might want to let him watch Nickelodeon.  He packs up his briefcase and leaves for work.  Right.  Creepy little kid, yeah.  Cartoon Network off with a little fag.  No kidding.  I'm going to watch the news, do you?  We got to start the clip over, but she's not going there.  You lying sack.  Your four-year-old does not watch the news.  She's so full of it.  If you see the video, she's...  Hey, lookit, there's Fox News.  They're reporting something very interesting.  No, it's WB, which is even worse, actually.  WB is...  Go to Fox 5, because I want to see, you know, what a four-year-old could watch. 
[01:28:30]  All right, so that's it.  We're watching Eleven also, who has...  We've noticed, look how stupid...  They're doing the robot at the anchor desk.  This is important news.  Now they're doing some kind of kickboxing class.  Now they're at the beach doing...  This is attention deficit disorder news.  They don't know what the hell they're doing.  You know what the clip was they had before us, the one that led into us going on, the serious  news?  It was a guy drinking doggy beer out of a dog dish. 
[01:29:00]  And Jody Applegate talked him into taking his shirt off before he drank the doggy beer.  That's the serious news.  Serious news.  Yeah, the important news.  Before you try to bring a little levity...  You know, we color up a little bit.  Yeah, a little levity into this serious, chain-breaking story.  Are you guys happy with the results?  I think so.  That will be the most press, the most attention Jody Applegate ever gets in her entire career.  All right, here we go.  Let's play the second clip.  We haven't played this on our show yet.  More Jody Applegate from the beginning again. 
[01:29:30]  Thank you, Stacey.  And did you see what happened down there?  Yeah, I did.  And Jody, I just want to say something.  I completely agree with what you're saying because I have a four-year-old nephew that  watches the show all the time and he gets pretty, pretty scared at the sight of whatever  looks grotesque, especially when it comes to blood.  So I agree with you 100%.  I just want everyone to know that, I mean, we have fun on the show.  We try to do unpredictable things, but we were absolutely not part of that.  Those guys totally burned us.  We thought they were going to do a genuine demonstration and we would never plan anything that was supposed 
[01:30:00]  to be bloody and gruesome.  And I'm apologizing that that got out over the air at all.  It was ridiculous that they did that to us.  So if they're ever selling something on the internet, don't buy it.  They're jerks.  And we totally were not part of planning that.  Anyway, it is 7.56 and we're not going to let that stop our show because we do have  some fun and legitimate things planned here this morning, such as making Mark Joyella  take his clothes off.  Because we're into serious stuff here this morning, right, Mark?  We're getting a lot of email. 
[01:30:30]  Now, because of this law in England, they are proposing making it illegal for men to go  shirtless, just as it is, for women.  That's the big news.  You guys are jerks.  Sorry for the ketchup prank.  Back to taking your clothes.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  After that all took place, her crew descended on us and was like grabbing us.  I hadn't cut through the lock yet.  We lost the key to the bike.  We brought a camera guy.  It's his bike.  So he comes over.  He's like, what should I do?  He's like, they're asking me for the videotape that I shot. 
[01:31:00]  And I said, just run.  He runs up the street, right?  He's booking up the street.  He said he got five blocks.  One of their guys, who looked like a janitor or just a crewman, grabs Ariel, our guy,  tears the camera out of his hands and goes back to the studio with it.  The camera's gone for like 10 minutes.  Completely.  They took our tape.  They stole our tape.  Completely illegal.  You should have.  Totally illegal.  That's actually stealing.  It's basically the fault.  Stealing.  Is that the formal charge?  This is a news program.  He took it, Mr. Wilson. 
[01:31:30]  This is a news program.  Robbery.  By force, right?  Aggravated.  Robbery.  Yeah.  And they quite literally assaulted us, especially Van.  They pushed Van around really good.  I heard you off camera going, ow, ow, ow.  You sound like Private Pyle getting hit with soap, bars of soap in a pillowcase.  Ow.  How big a story do you do on bike stealing?  Go back to sleep.  If you have a bike, Jody.  If you see a Puerto Rican coming, hide your bike.  There's the story. 
[01:32:00]  Back to you.  Oh, man.  That was great, guys, man.  Yeah.  He absolutely loved it.  Now, what were you hoping for?  I mean, you couldn't possibly have hoped for that.  We didn't think, in our wildest dreams, we didn't think it was going to be that good.  Yeah.  But the night before, they called us, and they were like, let's go on.  We were like, all right.  And we were like, I was like, man, we should F with them a little bit.  We should do something to color this up.  And then we were watching Dumb and Dumber.  You know the skit in Dumb and Dumber where he grabs his throat and he's got the ketchup  packet in his hand?  We're like, let's do exactly that. 
[01:32:30]  And we didn't think, because it's a goddamn ketchup packet.  Yeah.  It's a packet of ketchup.  It's not like you set up squibs to blow off on your neck and look like you were-  I mean, I'm on the ground, writhing around, and I jump up and say, just kidding, just  kidding.  We didn't know she was going to lose it like that.  Yeah.  You were bleeding.  It was like watching Robert Shaw at the end of Jaws.  It was really great, dude.  I'm so annoyed that scumbag went and took the guy's camera.  I really wish that guy would get arrested for that.  Camera and push them around like they really got aggressive. 
[01:33:00]  We got the camera back, but they took the tape.  I mean, we don't care about the camera.  Yeah, it's all about the tape.  Backstage footage.  You should make them give you that tape back.  Yeah.  Definitely.  I'm sure it's cool.  And why was she talking like a teenager?  Dude.  Not cool.  That was not cool.  That was not cool, dude.  Dude, and she's pointing and giving you the thumb like-  Total jerk.  You could see her push then in that shot.  She goes, that was not cool, dude.  Cool, dude.  She gives a little shove.  She gives a little throw.  It's really good, too, that she's-  I love when they choose to editorialize. 
[01:33:30]  Do you think she ever said that about a suicide bomber in Jerusalem?  Like, he's a jerker.  He's not cool, dude.  No, it's just these two guys for messing up her piece.  Did, now, initially, I guess you had something up on a website about stealing bikes.  Yeah, that movie's actually really good, too.  I mean, even if it had been the real story, it wouldn't have been this big, but it was good.  Like, we stole four bikes in one hour, and like one of the tools, like the big shocker,  one of the tools we use is this angle grinder that we plugged into a light fixture, and no one did anything. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, we did it all.  You just sat there, stood there, like, sawn through this chain, and no one looked.  No one asked questions.  Ah, you gotta love New York.  Try doing that anywhere else, man.  Excuse me.  Hey, what are you doing there?  Hey, that's probably somebody else's bike.  Would you forget your lock or something?  Hey, maybe you need a hand.  Hey, Bobby, come over.  We'll help these people.  They did not-  No one did a thing.  One person came over and helped us.  They're like, if you're going to cut through the lock, use bolt cutters.  Here, we can borrow mine.  Oh, that's awesome.  And that was it.  And the cops go by, and the cops are like, you know, you can't, I'm like 50 feet away, 
[01:34:30]  like, you can't videotape here.  And I was like, but, uh, I'm not.  Yeah, the big thing is videotaping.  Yeah, no videotaping.  And taking pictures.  But, uh, so you have this legitimate thing about how many bikes you can steal and how easy  it is.  Kind of legit.  Yeah, just kind of showing people how easy it is to steal a bike.  I just think Jody has a real hard-on for YouTube.  I mean, she mentions a couple times that she wants to get on YouTube.  That's what that Daily News article is about.  Really?  And this movie was popular on YouTube, and the whole clip, she says something about 
[01:35:00]  YouTube.  I think it's like her new buzzword, like maybe.  Yeah.  She's trying to be hip with the kids.  Maybe her four-year-old taught it to her like a week before.  Well, she, uh, she made the.  She did make it.  It's a big name for her.  Yeah.  She really did.  She really is worthless.  That was great to hear two broads kvetching.  That's what you want in the morning news.  Yeah.  Holes yapping.  I didn't like that either.  Talk over some laundry.  That's what they should be talking about.  As they're folding men's shirts.  We're folding and removing little fabric softeners from men's underwear.  Stupid broad.  Shut up.  We completely condone.  Absolutely. 
[01:35:30]  Completely condone.  Oh, yes.  We love this stuff.  The press has been really great.  We're, um, we're doing Whoopi's show next.  Oh, you are.  Have fun on that one.  We're going on to talk about.  Talk about how nice it could have been if she hadn't blown up like that.  Right.  You guys are just trying to bring a little fun and levity and laughter into people's lives.  And she was mean to you.  We're just trying to lighten up people.  Hey, uh, you guys got anything to promote?  Websites?  Just check out the...  You can check out our website.  Nice.Brothers.com.  Yeah.  N-E-I-S-T-A-T.  All right. 
[01:36:00]  Very cool.  What do you do?  What do you guys do?  We make movies.  You just make movies.  Yeah.  And F with people.  Go around and screw with people.  That's great.  You nailed them.  We got to take a break.  We got Will Ferrell checking in next.  Whoopi is calling us out.  We have no lives.  Audio being sent to us.  Ew.  Get a life.  She's at that already.  Get a life.  Oh, the pest.  We should have some Whoopi audio after the break as well.  I want to thank you guys.  If you want to hang out, you're more than welcome.  We just got Will Ferrell calling and some other things we got to get to.  Will Ferrell didn't try to pull a fast one on the news. 
[01:36:30]  No.  These guys did.  They made news.  That's right.  Right.  And after the break, we're going to tell you what time it is.  Anything else planned?  No.  They can't say.  You never know.  It's not going to happen.  You're going to have to change your look and everything to get the next one done.  Yeah, you're going to all be disguised.  It's a ruse.  It's a new catchphrase.  Oh, that was my favorite line.  It's a ruse.  A ruse.  What is this, 1850?  I haven't heard that word since my grandfather died.  It is mere jocularity. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  And once again, starting tomorrow, we spread to Chicago and San Francisco.  Go.  ONA party bomb!  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do ya?  It's all about me.  Is it?  I was assaulted.  Were ya?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  Oh, that sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did ya?  It's the O.P. 
[01:37:30]  and Anthony show.  Is it?  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony.  XM.O.2.  That's right.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We've got to go right to the phone and say hi to Will Farrell.  He only has a few minutes here. 
[01:38:00]  Will.  There he is.  Let me turn down the music in the background.  Hey, Will.  How's it going?  How are you, man?  Very good.  Everything cool?  Oh, totally.  You're doing the whole press thing, huh?  Yeah.  You've got a whole list of radio stations in front of you, and we're one of the stations,  and you've got to make believe that you know us and all that.  XM Satellite.  Hey, there you go.  Well, not just.  Oh, but I'm confused because I thought it was commercial-free, the satellite radio. 
[01:38:30]  Well, we've got an amazing radio deal.  We're on commercial radio and XM.  We decided to do both.  You dirty sons of bitches.  Yep.  That's what we did.  We do like another half hour, and then we go over to XM exclusively starting at 9 o'clock until 11 o'clock.  Then it's the potty mouth show.  That's the way to do it.  Yep.  Do both, right?  See how smart we are?  Yeah, I've got to figure that out.  Will and I have actually done some acting together.  Yeah, we've got Jim Norton in the studio.  Yeah, Jim, we did the Colin Quinn show.  Oh, my God, you remember? 
[01:39:00]  I thought I was going to have to explain and then explain my role, and you would go,  oh, yeah, that guy.  Oh, thanks.  No, no, we did a fantastic sketch.  You were fantastic.  I played Marv Gresto, the attorney.  Oh, wait a minute.  I remember seeing that one.  Wait, I never saw this one.  Yeah, Will came in and did a third act sketch for Colin and wore an elf hat, and it was really  funny, and Colin kind of expressed his jealousy at the fact that Will has gone through the  roof.  Yeah, making huge amounts of money and great movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lots of them.  And Colin got to go off on me.  Yeah, but it was really, it was great.  And Colin will always be the guy from remote control. 
[01:39:30]  So, you're promoting Talladega Nights, The Ballad of Bobby Rickey.  I'm promoting Talladega Nights.  It starts at Ricky Bobby.  It's out in theaters Friday.  Yeah, this Friday.  It'll be in, I think it's in four theaters.  It's about time they made a movie about NASCAR.  Yeah, that's why we did it.  We were like thinking, why isn't anyone going after this thing?  Yeah, it looks like a very serious movie about NASCAR, too.  Really more of a docudrama.  Not many stereotypes going on in the movie from what I've seen. 
[01:40:00]  None whatsoever.  What are your kids' names?  Walker and Texas Ranger.  See?  That is asinine.  I love it.  And your sponsor is Wonder Bread?  I drive the Wonder Bread car.  Yeah, how great is that?  Yeah, that's pretty manly there.  Drives the Old Spice car.  How great is it, though, doing movies as opposed to like SNL?  Do you miss it at all or not even a little?  Not even a little right now. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Everyone we talk to from SNL has just nightmare stories about what it was like to work there  and get your sketches in.  I actually fared pretty well.  Yeah, you did really well.  I mean, you had a lot of characters.  You had a lot of exposure every week.  So you weren't one of those poor guys that was like, you know, in the background, like  Jay Moore.  Yeah.  Who I think I saw him once as a pirate and once like on Captain Nemo's submarine.  And then the rest of the time he would just wave goodbye and talk to the band about what 
[01:41:00]  drugs they would do later.  I don't ever tend to have banter with people on stage.  Right.  Jay was the Boo Radley of SNL.  But yeah, you had, I mean, you know, standout characters.  Yeah.  I mean, that thing is, it's a tough, obviously a tough, tough environment.  But yeah, I was able to kind of, you know, the thing though, like we all came in at the  same time as one group.  So they kind of had to use us. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Where Jay and a lot of people came in like one at a time and it was hard to, that much  harder to kind of break through.  Yeah.  When they brought all you guys on, that was kind of the rebirth of the show because people  were really tired of it.  No, we were either going to, yeah, it was either going to be the last season or we were  going to do okay and keep it afloat.  Yeah, and then it came out, you guys got a few of those sketches like the cheerleader  thing and everything that really people started talking about again because no one was really  talking about SNL for a while.  Will's highlight DVD is one of the best.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  One of the best.  I have Will.  And he's not afraid to get naked in movies.  Right.  Which is good.  We've seen that.  Yeah.  One of the funniest scenes.  Is it true there's...  That's one of my signature moves.  Yeah.  Is it true there's going to be another old school?  No, not that I know of.  Everyone's...  It wasn't...  Oh, they didn't call you back.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, Opie, you shouldn't have brought that up.  Well, Luke Wilson was on our show and he was talking about how excited he was because  there was going to be another old school.  Yeah.  Oh, those bastards. 
[01:42:30]  I think what happened is that Will heard about it and he did like what Duvall did in Godfather  3.  He purposely probably priced himself out because he didn't like the script.  Ah, there you go.  That's what Will did.  I don't think so.  Is there going to be another Elf movie?  There's actually going to be six Elfs.  You got a franchise there, though, man.  I mean, there's still more to do with that character.  Elf is going to go into outer space.  Yeah.  And you know you can do that.  Elf is the center of the earth.  Elf takes Manhattan.  Just copy the Friday the 13th. 
[01:43:00]  Do it.  Elf goes to communist China.  You've had a great movie career so far.  A lot of people leave SNL and try to make the translation and it doesn't work.  You got to be grateful that your movie career is not only good, but it's fantastic.  Are you kidding me?  I'm like, yeah.  I'm very thankful that I'm not Roxbury 2 and 3.  Yeah.  Yeah, there are a few boring Colin Quinn.  It always goes back to Quinn.  Yes.  He actually –  Crocodile Dundee 2.  Crocodile Dundee 2. 
[01:43:30]  And the arrogant Colin actually rewrote the second half of the script to kind of make himself the star.  It's the greatest thing anyone's ever done in show business.  I love Colin.  It's a complete ass.  Yeah, and he handed it in.  They just kind of politely avoided eye contact.  So Will's got to do like a million of these today.  So before we let you go, the general –  I've got to call Lexington, Kentucky next.  Ooh.  Wow.  Hey, are you talking with Whoopi Goldberg today?  It's her first day on the air here in New York.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, she's doing well. 
[01:44:00]  No, she wasn't on the list.  Never did a movie with her or anything?  No.  Ever meet her?  No.  Oh, good.  Do you want to meet her?  But I was hanging out with Mel Gibson.  Oh, you were?  Yeah.  You must not be one of those evil Jews.  What is that guy thinking?  I don't know.  Not?  Yeah.  Not thinking?  I think he has a drinking problem.  Could be.  Like, you know, you have a few beers or something, and God forbid you've got to get into the  car because you've got to get home.  What do you do?  You drive the best you've ever driven. 
[01:44:30]  And if, heaven forbid, something happens, you keep your mouth shut.  Yeah.  Right.  When the cuffs go on.  You know what?  Talk about the deaf.  Yeah.  Because they apparently can't hear and don't care.  Or just, you know, say you don't have to apologize for the drunk driving and your racist  stupid – what are you doing, Mel?  Oh, it's Hollywood.  It's like you're a construction worker somewhere.  What an ass.  They're going to hear about it.  Hey, the film is called – how do you say the first word, Will?  Talladega.  Oh, I don't know.  Talladega Nights, The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, out in theaters August 4th. 
[01:45:00]  Dude, man, we're really big fans, and it's really nice to see you, like, going through  the roof.  And every film you do is, like, funny and successful.  And I'm not just groveling, so I'd love to be in one.  And Jim Norton, MBS team management.  What a sap.  No, I think you're great, man.  Well, I appreciate it, you guys.  All right.  Thank you, Will.  Okay.  August 4th.  Good luck, buddy.  Have fun with the Lexington interview.  Yeah, I will.  Lexington, Kentucky, next for Will Farrell.  Thanks, Will.  Bye.  Take care.  He goes, Will, right now he's on the phone with another station.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Instantly.  He has no clue.  He has no clue.  Well, he knows Jimmy.  There'll be no recollection of what he did.  What was that, 800 stations?  Are we done?  Can I go home?  He might vaguely remember that he might have had a little fun with our phoner.  Did the last call, who was Slappy and Wappy?  Where are they at?  Okay.  Put him on.  We know.  He's a really nice guy, too.  Yeah.  I was a very nervous medium because of who he was, and he was just really...  When you met him in person, not on the phone, like we did.  Yeah, but I was a nobody in the sketch.  Colin just used to do that because Colin never admitted it, but he did love me, and he 
[01:46:00]  didn't want to put me in the sketch with the big celebrities because he  knew it made me happy.  Aw.  That's why he did that.  That's cute.  Yeah.  Like the little retarded kid.  You bring him in, like the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  I made love to the camera.  Hey, we got the Whoopi calls coming in.  You guys ready for this?  No.  Yes.  I'm really not.  Well, there's people just tuning in.  Hey, why don't you give the big setup, please?  Well, it's Wake Up With Whoopi.  We'd like to welcome her to New York.  It's her first day on the air over there at KTO, the station. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, look at that.  We gave her a plug.  But she's with Cubby, who he's been in radio in New York for about 10 years.  He's one of these nice jocks.  Yeah, very nice guy.  Everything has to be nice.  Never really made any...  Don't ever get mean-spirited.  Yeah.  Never really made any big news or anything, which, you know, that's fine.  You want to just have a radio career.  That's fine.  You don't have to be in the paper all the time or anything.  And he's eked out a nice career in New York over the years.  If you're in New York for that many years, I guess you've got to be doing something right. 
[01:47:00]  They'd boot your ass right out.  It's the number one market.  But they teamed him up with Whoopi, and I just see it as very awkward.  They're trying to make this a nice show.  Trying to make Whoopi's show the nice show, the alternative to this nastiness that's all over the air,  permeating the airwaves.  So they made the mistake and gave out the phone number because they want listeners to call up.  And our pests have been calling and getting through. 
[01:47:30]  And it is the most awkward, cringe-inducing thing to listen to because they don't know how to handle it.  I mean, people call us, and when they bitch about us, we're so used to it.  We know just to go right into attack mode, it's very hard to get at us on this show.  We have a defense.  We have a great offense.  We're a great team here.  They fall apart.  They just wet themselves.  And it's over, Johnny.  A couple of calls in, they're already cracking. 
[01:48:00]  She tries to get serious.  Yeah, tries to scold us and the callers.  And it's just cringe-inducing.  She doesn't get it.  No.  Well, we'll explain it after you hear the audio.  But here's the first clip.  A Ramon call got through.  We're going to go to line seven to Tony now in Garden City.  He's an EMS man.  Oh, we love the EMS.  Hello, Tony.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up?  Pretty good.  Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I was doing my round in Nassau County.  I go into a Dunkin' Donuts for the morning coffee. 
[01:48:30]  They have the show on.  And they just, remind me, you won't make the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I felt that one coming.  Did you?  Did you feel it coming?  Did you?  Did you feel it coming?  It just, the wheels fall off at the slightest little problem there.  And this is, I felt, I, this is only the beginning.  That was a speed bump. 
[01:49:00]  And all of a sudden, she starts driving like Harry Chapin.  So, uh.  Hold to yourself, Whoopi.  Well, she, uh, we got to her.  So, uh, here's, here's the next bit of audio.  You know what's cool?  We're a brand new show.  Today's our first day.  All right, hold on.  I got to address that because I forgot what Cubby does here.  If you're, if you're on the air going, you know what's cool?  You know what's great after you've just been bashed?  It's not cool.  And it's not great.  You are miserable.  Right.  You're smiling and pretending you're eating cotton candy while that uncle breathes whiskey 
[01:49:30]  into your face from the back.  That's what you're doing.  Don't disassociate, you silly goose.  You know what's great?  You know what's funny?  At this point, you realize you don't have the chops to deal with this.  And, and, and.  And that you are screwed.  And it's early day one.  And you're already at a loss of what to do.  Yeah, you've just walked into the new job.  And your greeting has been a kick to the teeth.  And you're wiping your gums in the sink going, you know, it's great.  That other guy thought I was such a threat to his new job that he kicked me in the mouth.  Right.  And you don't know which other worker is going to kick you in the teeth throughout the rest 
[01:50:00]  of the day.  You know what?  You have lemons.  Just eat them as lemons.  Stop trying to make lemonade.  You don't have any sugar, stupid.  Get a sourpuss.  The glass is half empty.  Exactly.  No, it's not half full.  It's half empty.  And if it is half full, it's half full.  You know what's really cool?  When you're trying to say something funny.  Isn't it funny?  Isn't it great?  When you flob a line. 
[01:50:30]  I hope they think the glass is half full and it is with AIDS.  They're going to come up with reasons why we're doing this.  Yeah.  It's the audio you're about to hear.  Let me make it perfectly clear for the listeners out there that don't really know about us  yet.  We're just bored.  Yeah.  This spices up our morning.  It spices up the listening pleasure and it gives the pest something to do.  A homework assignment.  That's all it is.  We're not thinking past that. 
[01:51:00]  We're not thinking, uh-oh, this is competition.  We like making people miserable.  Yeah, it's fun.  And one reason, because we're bored and we have to fill up five hours of radio.  And because her last name is Goldberg, which is Jewish.  And we're gay.  As you know, when I get drunk, I don't like the Jews.  Oh, she's got the double whammy.  She's got the old Sammy Davis.  All right, here we go.  So they're going to explain what's going on here to their listeners.  Getting it all wrong.  You know what's cool?  We're a brand new show.  Today's our first day. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  But a lot of other radio stations are nervous about us.  And they're talking about us.  Isn't that funny?  You know what?  Why would I be nervous?  We got nothing to leave.  I'll tell you why we're nervous.  Because people who are listening to that dreck are going to throw their radios out the window  and not be able to tune in and hear us.  And it will affect us from the ratings.  They'll kick their radios.  Uh, another whoopee clip.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  And a cubby clip. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, where are the white women at?  Here we go.  And they're talking about us.  Isn't that funny?  You know what?  Why would I be nervous?  We got nothing to lose.  But you know what bugged me about that?  What?  Don't use the MS guys, man.  Don't use the MS to...  When did we use the MS guys?  The MS?  Oh, I thought it was multiple sclerosis guys.  But she says MS.  No, she said don't use the MS.  She said MS.  Yeah, but all I hear is MS.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Well, I guess she's trying to talk like ghetto.  No, here's what that is.  That's the cubby, and that's for the cello tie-in.  Right.  You want to go with the MS?  Oh, wow.  Very good, Jimmy.  Nice reference.  Wow.  Great.  Tying it all together with a disease.  Old twisted root body with her stupid Mouseketeers ears on.  That's right.  Have some peanut butter.  M-I-C.  See me walk?  No.  K-E-Y.  Why?  Because God hates me.  She thinks we're messing with the EMS guys. 
[01:53:00]  Go screw her.  This is the furthest tie-in she could do is that to try to get to us by saying we're goofing  on the EMS guy.  The EMS guy, the guy used the character to get through to our show, didn't goof on the  EMS guy.  Right.  Didn't say anything bad about EMS.  Right.  Here we go.  What?  You know what?  How are we going to be nervous?  We got nothing to lose.  But you know what bugged me about that?  What?  Don't use the EMS guys, man.  Don't use the EMS to get on the EMS.  Clueless.  That's a big deal. 
[01:53:30]  Because here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  There are other folks out there.  Some of them are good and some of them are not.  We are no threat to anybody.  We're just doing a show that we want to be doing.  Howard understands that.  That's my friend.  These other people, they're not worth the dust Howard walks in.  Yeah, he'll help you.  So whatever they're doing, let him keep doing it.  Maybe you can talk to him about strategy.  But you know what?  Don't mess with the EMS.  Don't mess with the EMS.  Because you know what, y'all?  You other guys who are messing with us, they know where you are.  You're listening.  Why did he laugh at that? 
[01:54:00]  I'm telling you.  What does that mean?  You don't want to mess with the EMS, folks.  You don't want to mess with the EMS.  We're not messing with the EMS.  Who messes with the EMS?  What are they going to do anyway?  Show up and give us oxygen?  Yeah, they're going to put a little mask on us.  Don't mess with us.  We'll come over and swab your arms.  Just watch it.  Watch it, Buster.  I'll put one of those neck braces on you.  You won't be able to turn your head.  Just showing she's completely clueless.  Poor Cubby having to laugh at that.  She's having something that rhymed.  Don't mess with the EMS.  Well, that was almost funny.  I better laugh at something this morning.  And then Cubby tried to rhyme. 
[01:54:30]  He said, you know, I hope ratings get bigger because I'm on the radio with the...  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on me.  Shame on you, Jimmy Norton.  I beeped it.  Shame on you.  I can beep and talk at the same time.  Oh, shame on you.  People don't understand that.  Do you mean I really probably didn't say anything?  You probably didn't.  Oh, well.  All right, here we go.  Here's the next whoopee clip that got through.  And then we'll get an update from Doug OutDoug, one of the fine O&A pests. 
[01:55:00]  And if you want to give us a call at 1-800-449-8686, know that we're going to probably screen a little bit better because we have people trying to infiltrate.  Which flatters us, by the way.  It's a very wonderful thing.  It's a very wonderful thing.  But people who are unsure of themselves as human beings try to make it all for others.  Ew.  Not sure.  Ew.  Fine, I'm missing all the goodness.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm missing all the goodness.  I have to...  Get your ews out of the way.  My teeth kicked in, and you start to go for the psychoanalysis. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  She's now psychoanalyzing us.  Yeah, you're just doing that because you're insecure.  Exactly.  You got it.  You got us.  Is that the best you have?  That's what all performers are.  All right.  We love watching other people bombing.  Exactly.  Why are you a stand-up comic, stupid?  Because you're insecure.  You're saying it's a very wonderful thing.  But people who are unsure of themselves as human beings try to make trouble for others.  Waking up with Whoopi.  103.5.  Cubby and Whoopi hang and lose.  Holla.  Hang and lose.  Holla?  Ew. 
[01:56:00]  Did Cubby...  Wait a minute.  Ew.  Hold it.  Did Cubby just say holla?  Holla!  I hope not.  No.  That's a misunderstanding.  No, he didn't just say holla.  We do this to get under people's skin and we're bored.  That's the only...  We don't think further than that.  Cubby, stop it.  No, don't say holla.  You don't do that.  Unless she's trying to shave you and fight the urge to cut your throat, you don't say holla. 
[01:56:30]  Don't say holla.  Do we have any more coming in?  Hopefully.  Let's say hi to Doug out Doug.  Doug?  We need more pests because of our morning attacks.  We have such horrible numbers in the morning because I guess the pests work more than I thought.  No, they don't.  We've already made them clear their lines twice.  They're starting to take numbers and call back the callers, which is day one of their show.  So that's really great. 
[01:57:00]  And I fell for a really old trick, which I'm kicking myself right now for.  Yeah.  They took my call while in commercial break, which is one of the oldest tricks.  Oh, no.  You didn't fall for that.  Yeah.  When I started my call and I referred...  See, I had a quick one.  I just referred to her show as Waking Up with Yard Ape.  Jesus.  Well, Doug.  Doug.  Maybe that's why there's a problem.  Doug.  And what we like is, you know, if it doesn't make the radio, that sucks, but we would love  to hear the actual phone calls. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, I know.  And it's...  You can send those in.  Doug out Gibson.  Yeah.  Yeah, no kidding.  Jesus, you're a racist.  We don't have to chop our head off.  Just make our life a little miserable.  But for those of you that want to get involved in the pest activities, the MySpace is myspace.com  slash Opie and Anthony Pests.  And you can get the information there.  We need more people for the morning because you guys are on in the morning on FM now.  It makes no sense for us to be hitting people at night.  We need to go in the morning more.  Yeah.  Very good.  Very good.  It's been a lot of fun so far. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  Good job, sweetie.  We got to take a break to catch up a little bit, but the whoopee attack is on.  And we're doing it just to have fun.  We're not scared of whoopee in the morning.  Trust me.  Well, we're threatened, according to...  To a cubby.  Holla.  We take all radio shows seriously, but this one we're not scared of whatsoever.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio to the power of rock. 
[01:58:30]  Sounds exciting.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, man.  This went by way too fast.  First half of the Opie and Anthony Show, almost over.  We're going to continue on XM Satellite Radio in about 15, 20 minutes.  We got Mark Burnett checking in later on today, later on this morning.  The creator of Survivor and The Amazing Race and The Apprentice.  Mm-hmm.  He pretty much invented reality TV for America.  You're lying, by the way. 
[01:59:00]  I invented reality television, Robin.  I mean, Opie.  That's right.  He did say that.  I invented everything.  Yeah, he did say that.  Great.  Congrats.  Howie history.  Royalty checks for everything must just be coming in.  Air.  Look at this.  I got a royalty check for the invention of air.  Every day he walks to his mailbox, something else.  Look at this one.  Blinking.  Robin, I get a royalty check every time someone blinks because I invented this.  People used to walk around and go, my eyes are so dry. 
[01:59:30]  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  I taught them to blink.  Shut up.  Invented everything.  Yes, Jimmy, you were saying.  No, no, I just mentioned the girls coming in.  Oh, yeah.  We got some girls from the movie The Descent, the new horror movie.  It's pretty creepy.  We'll get into that as well a little later this morning.  The ONA traveling virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon to a venue near you.  Well, coming real soon.  This Saturday, Worcester Centrum, or the DCU Center up there in Boston, Worcester area, actually.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com. 
[02:00:00]  And all the info is up on opianthony.com.  We're going to be broadcasting live Friday from WBCN.  We're hoping the past and the listeners show up to hang with us as we do our radio show from BCN on Friday, okay?  And I think we'll have some ONA traveling virus tickets to give away Friday morning.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  All right?  Yeah.  And we got a bunch of the guys from the comedy tour coming in for the rest of the week.  Holla.  I think Bill Burr tomorrow, I think Bob Kelly Wednesday, I think Patrice Thursday, and some 
[02:00:30]  of the other guys will be calling in as the week goes on, okay?  Where's Patrice been?  We haven't seen him in a month.  He's been very, very busy doing his thing, so.  Jail?  Patrice back on the pro.  Oh.  Why jail?  Why?  Because he's black.  Why?  All right, cool.  Makes sense.  That's why I said it.  Attaboy.  Sorry.  Oh, Howard invented MTV Unplugged, too.  Don't forget that one.  That's right.  Can we play that clip?  That clip makes me laugh so hard.  He tried to claim that he invented MTV Unplugged.  No one played acoustic music before I did. 
[02:01:00]  He's trying to say he was the first guy to have a band play on a show.  Yeah.  On a radio show.  I think he could date it back to, and here's Benny Goodman and his orchestra playing live  from this very radio studio.  From the imaginary ballroom.  Here it is, live and unplugged.  Hoo-hoo, they're ripping me off.  Have a Lucky Strike cigarette.  Let's say hi to Jamie in the Bronx. 
[02:01:30]  Jamie.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Jamie?  Yeah, I was listening to Whoopi's show during your commercial break.  She's lying to her audience already.  Why?  She's telling everybody she's cute.  She looks like a fugitive from a pancake box.  That doesn't even make sense.  The fact that you should have a fugitive from a pancake box.  I know, that's what made me laugh.  Why would you have to be a fugitive?  Like, why would you run away from that?  And what he wanted to say, this is what I like about it.  He wanted to say Aunt Jemima, but he was trying to, like, kind of make it clever. 
[02:02:00]  Like, he just kind of fell down.  A fugitive means that you left the pancake box and you're being chased.  How could you possibly leave the pancake box?  First of all, yeah, you can't leave the pancake box.  Secondly, why would anyone chase you for it?  Right, who, the Aunt Jemima people couldn't replace you?  They have to chase you down?  You make no sense, sir.  All right.  Fugitive.  For today, the last O&A pest call to the Whoopi program.  All right.  Well, I don't know what time the show goes till. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, yeah, there may be more.  There may be more.  I mean, once we get over to, uh...  Don't mess with the EMS.  What time?  Oh, 10?  Nine.  They only go to nine?  See, we have no choice.  We have to end at nine so we can continue on XM.  Aw.  Well, and I'm sure at nine o'clock they're going to be like,  whew, thank God that's over.  This is payback for firing Gumbagiani, who's my friend.  Right.  I like Gumbagiani, and I don't like the way he was let go.  There you go.  Like the EMT.  You don't mess with him.  Here's, uh... 
[02:03:00]  Here's the last...  Well, EMT is also...  Actually called emergency medical technicians.  Yes.  Here's the last, uh, O&A pest call to Whoopi.  And now we got Jerry in New Jersey.  What line's he on?  New Jersey.  He's on line seven.  We got so many lines ringing, by the way.  I bet.  Why do you think?  I bet you do.  Why do you think?  Oh, they were all excited.  Aw.  Oh, that's a shame.  They were all excited when the lines were all lit.  Like, wow, we're a hit.  Look, we're an early hit. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, this is true.  Oh, no.  That is tragic.  All are...  Oh, look at that.  Because you know...  Dude, you know how radio is.  Oh, yeah.  So you're looking at the lines going, oh, man, we're a hit.  Yeah, it makes...  Everyone's calling.  They're interested.  There's a buzz.  It's all our pests.  We're the buzz in New York radio.  Oh.  Yeah, when we see our phones lit up, we're like, oh, all right.  All right.  We're on a subject that people, uh, maybe want to talk about.  Something is happening.  Holla.  Holla.  Ugh.  We promoted this on our show, so... 
[02:04:00]  So all those calls ringing were our pests trying to get through, and this one got through.  We had so many lines ringing, by the way.  Oh, my goodness.  Which is pretty cool.  They're all from my mom.  My mom's calling in.  What's his name?  Hey, Jerry.  Hi, it's Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  They wrote down Jerry.  Yeah, it's my birthday.  I feel like it's been my birthday this whole year.  Oh.  I woke up today, I realized it was my birthday, but I had the old gravy leg.  So tonight I'm going to the O&A party rock, but I wanted you to say... 
[02:04:30]  All right.  I love the disgust.  That's not my favorite part.  All right.  For the pest attack, I just love the, uh, the disgust.  The, oh, oh, God.  Oh, is that funny?  The old gravy leg.  The old gravy leg.  All right.  All right.  Oh, they're just disgusted.  They're defeated.  Guy would have went on forever.  Various references to that dumb show that I got to make believe I don't know anything about. 
[02:05:00]  That's the best, too.  Uh, that show that I have no clue about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So tonight I'm going to the O&A party rock, but I wanted you to say...  All right.  It was like...  And then he laughed.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Looks like a lolly.  Well, at least you get the real voice out of the guy. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  It takes this to get the real voice instead of the...  All right.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, I can't say...  Yeah.  Buster.  Yeah.  Listen, Buster.  Pally.  So tonight I'm going to the O&A party rock, but I wanted you to say...  All right.  He's talking about another DJ.  Another DJ.  He brought up another DJ on there.  Wait.  Oh, you know what's going on there?  Oh, God.  You can see her, like, moving...  You can feel it.  She's moving away from her mic.  What?  What just happened? 
[02:06:00]  She has no clue.  What's that about?  Cubby's probably making arm motions, like, dump, get out of this.  She doesn't know what's going on, so now he's got to explain without, like, giving us  any recognition or really acknowledging it.  Pandemonium.  What is the dishonesty about not saying the name?  And believe me, nobody here thinks that being on a name show on Whoopi's show is going  to make this show bigger.  But, like, we say Whoopi's show, KTU.  Tune in if you want.  Hey, there you go.  Give it a shot.  Who cares?  Where is the bravery and honesty? 
[02:06:30]  That must have just looked like the inside of the command module of Apollo 13 after hearing  that bang.  Just people waving their...  What the...  What?  What the...  Hey, what?  Hi.  Hi, God.  What?  Cubby, we have a problem.  Hi, God.  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  He's talking about another DJ.  Another DJ.  He brought up another DJ on there.  Why wouldn't we just say, okay?  Are we afraid of another DJ?  Well, if he says another DJ, no telling what he'll say after that. 
[02:07:00]  You will be the next call, Whoopi.  He was going to a bad place.  He was going to a bad place.  Yes, he was.  Well, Jerry, whatever your name is, that wasn't very nice.  And you know what?  It just goes to show you that we who have the button have the power.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Your nice show stinks.  That's right.  You know what else?  Instead of the button, you should have the shotgun trigger and your toe a-fumbling for it. 
[02:07:30]  At least he asked, though.  What, are we afraid of another DJ?  Hey, there you go.  At least he said that, which was honest.  Oh, yeah.  But then later on, we heard the speech.  Because that call, we played these a little out of order.  That was the first one that got through.  The first one.  Then the subsequent ones that got through, you heard him talking about a heavier screening,  and that's not nice, and we will not take those calls.  And that we're insecure.  Yeah.  And then she uses Howie's name because she thinks Howie's going to help her.  Good luck.  It's Manor's Monday. 
[02:08:00]  It is.  Just being polite.  Mm-hmm.  I wonder what tomorrow is.  Yep.  Can't think of anything.  Something with a T.  Something with a T.  Tuesday.  Followed by a Tuesday.  How about, um, it's, uh, timely to, no?  Let's go to Nigel.  Nigel.  No, nothing.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, Nigel.  I want to thank you guys, man.  You guys have got a great show.  I've been listening to you.  You are a virus.  I am hooked on you guys.  I like the way you can take the day's topics and make it run. 
[02:08:30]  It makes me wish I had XM because I would love to hear you two cursing.  I swear to God, I would.  Well, thanks, Nigel.  Aw, that's sweet.  You guys, crush Whoopi Goldberg.  Crush all these other clowns, bro.  They're not even DJs.  I'm a real DJ.  I'm a Negro who spins rock and roll records.  You crush all these clowns.  Earl.  Have a great day.  Is that you?  Thanks, Nigel.  Well, buy an XM, you silly goose, and listen to us all day.  Or at least steal one.  Someone stole mine.  Someone did.  Someone stole mine last summer, so they're a hot item.  Well, we can't really get into anything new because we've got like a minute left in the show. 
[02:09:00]  Damn it.  So we should just promote a couple things.  We're going to be on in Chicago and San Francisco starting tomorrow.  We're really, really excited.  So if you have XM and you're in Chicago and you have cheapo friends, tell them about us in Chicago.  Buy cheapo friends.  Go ahead.  Say it, Mel.  Oh, the Jews.  So I haven't had enough to drink, and I'm not driving. 
[02:09:30]  So I can't bitch about the Jews.  As good as Mel Gibson.  We've got to promote that.  And let's not forget that we're hitting the road.  We'll be in Boston Friday, broadcasting live from WBCN.  And we want to see a nice turnout.  And BCN, Dave Wellington and the gang, oh, we're going to make this bigger than life.  Yeah.  And then I started getting emails from Philly going, oh, yeah?  Wait till we do.  Wait till we do.  Wait till we do what we do.  Now.  Because now they're up for the challenge.  So Philly's already working on our, on our, on our, on our, on our, on our. 
[02:10:00]  Someone hit him.  On our, on our, on our live show in Philly.  I need something from Philly, by the way.  I need audio from Babe Fest.  Me and Gene Simmons.  Now that we're on there, you can give me that audio.  Yeah, that would be nice.  We'll play that on the show.  It would be very interesting.  All right, so it's Bud Light presenting the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy  event of 2006.  Holla.  Coming soon to a venue near you.  Holla.  The first date is already upon us this Saturday, August 5th. 
[02:10:30]  Holla.  Fist.  August 5th.  I've had a tough morning.  Holla.  August 5th at the DCU Center.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  Holla.  Ticketmaster locations.  The info is on OpieandAnthony.com.  Holla.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Holla.  Thanks, guys.  We greatly appreciate your support.  Holla.  Tell a friend about the Opie and Anthony show.  Holla.  Holla.  And if you're not joining us on XM, we'll see you tomorrow.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla. 
[02:11:00]  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Empire is spreading.  Conquer Earth, you bastards!  Opie and Anthony!  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:11:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  Opie and Anthony!  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Ah!  There we are on this end.  On this end of the programming day, Opie.  Wow, and look at all the fans out here today.  Woo-hoo!  Wow, it's loaded.  No, let's not fake it.  That's our staff making us feel good.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Three guys decide to show up today for the walk.  Nothing free and no celebrities.  Right, thanks guys.  Little dose of reality for O&A every so often.  Keeps us humble, keeps us honest.  So go fuck yourselves.  That guy has nothing to do.  That's the only reason he's here every morning.  He's a regular.  Goes to work at 10.  We got two regulars and a stranger for the walk today.  All right.  All right.  So, once again, we make the pilgrimage to the XM facility where we can say certain things. 
[02:12:30]  Look at our picture on the bus, Opie.  Hello.  Look at that.  Hello.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Dear God, you're right, our bad.  Over to where we can say bad words.  There were a couple I wanted to say over there.  I got close to using the F word.  I wanted to say fuck face so bad, I couldn't.  Yeah.  That really bothered me.  MTV Music Awards, huh? 
[02:13:00]  Are we invited this year?  Uh, no.  We should be.  We're back in everyone's good graces, right?  I think we might be, actually.  We should be.  I think we might be.  God damn it, make that happen.  It's on the same night as the David Letterman thing.  Oh, shit.  August 31st.  Oh, you had to remind me.  Now I'm nervous again.  We got to get the pest involved.  We got to, like, take over the audience. 
[02:13:30]  We got to have the pest in the audience, and then it'll be a lot easier for us.  We want a loaded audience.  We want a complete loaded audience.  We want the fans outside.  We really want the O&A pest to take control of the Letterman appearance.  Start calling them, asking for tickets.  Come on, God damn cabs.  Do whatever it takes to get a ticket for that David Letterman to help us out.  What was with that woman?  She was pissed off.  Which one?  I don't know.  She was crossing the street, and she, like, covered it.  She was ready to put her hand in the camera lens. 
[02:14:00]  That's Whoopi.  She just got off the air.  Oh, shit.  No, Whoopi, that's not Whoopi.  Whoopi!  Whoopi!  Good show today.  Whoopi!  I don't think that's Whoopi.  It looks just like her.  Does Whoopi walk with a cane hunched over?  It looks just like her.  She gained a few pounds.  She needs a cane after the beating we gave her today.  And that's nothing.  Oh, no. 
[02:14:30]  The pest will just keep that going.  And God bless them.  Dude, nothing going on on the walk today.  Nah, today, very dull.  Look at this afro.  This white afro this woman has.  Nice head.  She went to the parlor for that.  I go to the parlor.  It's this stretch between the last block we were just at 
[02:15:00]  and the studio where we see the weirdest people.  I wonder why that is.  Dave Matthews Band at Randall's Island.  Sold out, of course it is.  With Government Mule.  That's a good show.  I like seeing the new billboards.  What else?  Snakes on a Plane.  That's coming out soon.  Big buzz on that ant.  Big buzz.  Samuel Jackson.  Snakes on a Plane.  Ladies. 
[02:15:30]  Hey.  How you doing?  There it is.  What's in the bag, ma'am?  She didn't answer.  She shook her head no.  Wanted to know what was in her bag.  I want to know what was under that guy's hair.  It was like a soup bowl on his head.  What's in the bag?  You know, we're not even going to fake it today.  We'll see you guys upstairs to continue the Opie and Anthony show.  A warm up.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman. 
[02:16:00]  And every other kind of DVD.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:17:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  It's all about me. 
[02:17:30]  You're listening to Long Island's Best Rock.  102.3 WBAB.  The home of rock and roll.  That was Jethro Tull.  Aqua Love.  Before that, yes.  U2 gave us Where the Streets Have No Name.  And we started that set with the cars.  Bye-bye, love.  Bye-bye, love.  Speaking of love.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:18:00]  The second half exclusively on XM Satellite Radio.  The boys are still coming up in the elevator.  I'm sure there's going to be some horrific story to tell in a few minutes.  No, even the elevator ride was boring.  Holy crap, they got a lot of stuff out of here, too, over the weekend.  Cubicles are gone.  Starting to look like a radio station around here.  All right, on the second half of the show, we got Casey.  Oh, no, we did the Casey thing.  That's right. 
[02:18:30]  Girls from the Descent movie in studio at 930.  That should be in a few moments here.  Mark Burnett in studio at 10 o'clock.  The Surrey Watch is up to day 104.  Tomorrow, we start in Chicago and San Francisco as far as the commercial radio stations go.  Mousetrap Trivia this Wednesday.  We did the whoopee thing.  That was fantastic today.  That was just fantastic.  Miami Vice, number one at the box office with $25.5 million.  Wow.  Look at that. 
[02:19:00]  I love that Jamie Foxx.  I'm glad he's making a lot of money.  Is that getting good reviews, actually, Miami Vice?  No?  Another bomb?  It's one of those, eh, it's there, it's out there.  I've got to put my jacket back on because we're inside a building and it's 100 degrees out.  I needed a jacket.  The top movies over the weekend.  Good to see Clerks 2 still in the top 10 for the weekend.  $3.9 million for Clerks 2.  Warner Brothers Studios, a little bummed.  Why?  Their little animated feature. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, the Ant Bully?  Ant Bully.  Bomb.  I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because Monster House is out and Monster House is really, really good.  I think from the trailer, it doesn't look like a movie that, it doesn't come across like  one of those movies, the cartoon ones that adults and children like.  You know, like, what are the other ones?  Like Shrek.  Things like that.  You could watch it as an adult.  Which one?  The Ant Bully?  Yeah.  Well, Monster House is, I saw it with kids in the theater and they were screaming. 
[02:20:00]  They were scared.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they pretty much said, fuck the kids.  They're just going for the adult audience now?  I think they're going more adult with the Monster House.  I think when they get that crossover thing, that's when it's at its best.  You know, an adult can sit there.  Hey, you watch that Toy Story?  Toy Story 2?  Fantastic.  You could watch it as an adult.  Yeah, well.  Got some funny gags in there.  So what was the name of that?  Oh, the Ant Bully.  It only made $8.1 million.  It was in fifth place.  Yep.  Lady in the Water already dead in the water. 
[02:20:30]  Dead in the water.  Oh, where are you?  Lady in the Water is already fading fast.  Little Man fading fast.  Devil Wears Prada fading fast.  Monster House did $11.5 million, beating out the Ant Bully for fourth place.  John Tucker must die.  What's that about?  It's got John Tucker and he has to die.  That's all I know about it.  Big Kev knows.  Yeah, it's about a high school kid.  I guess he's dating three or four of the popular girls in the school and they find out that 
[02:21:00]  they're all dating him at the same time.  So he must die.  It's like high school.  You ruined it.  That's getting good reviews.  Is it?  Pirates of the Caribbean is still going strong.  $20.5 million.  Pirate to the Caribbean.  And then we got Miami Vice in first place.  But I'm thinking they wanted to do more than $25 million in their opening weekend, right?  Yeah.  I think they said their audience, very diverse. 
[02:21:30]  It's like 50-50 black-white.  But a lot of them are over 30.  Over 30 years old.  So I think they're getting a lot of people that are familiar with the show and going for  nostalgia reasons, kind of.  Right, right.  All right.  Big Kev celebrity interviews.  Oh, I liked this last time.  I think these are much improved. 
[02:22:00]  Will you talk to Bryan Singer, director of Superman and House?  Daniel Day Kim.  That's the dude from Lost.  Two dudes from Lost.  Never watched that show.  Sam Jackson.  Sam Jackson about snakes on a plane.  Samuel L. Jackson or just some guy named Sam Jackson?  No, the one in the movie.  Where did you talk to Sam Jackson?  San Diego.  Oh, cool.  Sam Jackson.  And what was this event?  I don't know him personally. 
[02:22:30]  This was the International Comic Con.  Ah, what was Sam Jackson doing?  Oh, they're all there now.  Promoting every movie.  No, he was there doing snakes on a plane press the entire day.  Now they just go to these things to promote.  It's become a...  San Diego particularly is humongous.  Every studio had a movie they were representing there.  Every single one.  It used to just be like the hack old stars from these old shows and stuff used to show up  and now it's real celebrities.  I talked to Hilary Swank.  The Hilary Swank.  Did you? 
[02:23:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  Did you ask her about her ex?  No.  Why not?  You pussy, why not?  Who's her ex?  Chad Lowe.  Rob Lowe's brother.  Apparently that's a substance of these issues.  Oh, right?  Apparently.  It is.  All right, here's Big Kev talking to Sam Jackson about snakes on a plane.  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Sam Jackson.  I'm jealous.  Talking about snakes on a plane. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  Go ahead, sir.  Wow.  God, this is just like Larry King.  That is some delivery to start up an interview.  Who said okay, go?  You or him?  That was...  He said okay.  He said okay.  He's like, that's it?  Okay?  He's waiting for, you know, the big question, the big starting of the interview process. 
[02:24:00]  I had just watched him do three interviews where I started exactly the same way that they did.  And he came right out of the gun at them.  Yeah.  And to me, he's just like, all right, motherfucker.  What do you want to know?  Probably because you said Big Kev and no other news people identified themselves with an adjective first.  As big something or little fella something or slippery guy.  Hi, this is ironic Ted. 
[02:24:30]  Hi, this is Jew Sally reporting.  That's why.  That could be.  All right, here we go.  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Sam Jackson talking about snakes on a plane.  That could be the greatest response ever.  This is going to be one of those things we have to play at least five times.  Holy shit.  And it's going to get funnier.  When he just goes, there's a silence in him. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  Is it because you called him Sam and not Samuel L.?  I don't think so.  I think he was just waiting for me to start with something.  But I had just seen him do, like, literally four or five the exact same way.  Here's Sam Jackson, snakes on a plane, and he just goes.  Questions do you ask them, motherfucker?  Let's try it again.  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Sam Jackson talking about snakes on a plane.  Okay. 
[02:25:30]  I love it.  All right.  There is something.  Okay.  My favorite part is the uncomfortable pause.  The pause.  Just the silence.  Okay.  Because he doesn't know what the hell.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, that's what I'm doing here.  What are you doing here?  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Sam Jackson talking about snakes on a plane.  Okay.  Go ahead, sir.  What do you want me to say about it? 
[02:26:00]  Tell me everything about it.  He doesn't even need you there.  What do you want me to say about it?  He doesn't even need you there.  You're going to ask me a question or some shit about it?  You should have handed him a paper and go, could you just talk about snakes on a plane  for Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show.  It's not about the snakes on the plane jewels.  It's about the dead interviewer in front of me.  Should we try from the beginning? 
[02:26:30]  Does that seat say dead interviewer storage?  One of the greatest movies ever.  Of course.  All right.  Let's try to get through this.  It's only 40 seconds.  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Sam Jackson talking about snakes on a plane.  Okay.  Go ahead, sir.  Go ahead, sir.  The more you hear it.  What do you want me to say about it?  Tell me everything about it.  Uh, geez.  It's, uh, it's kind of what it sounds like. 
[02:27:00]  You know, it's a bunch of poisonous snakes on a plane full of passengers.  There's, uh, us trying to survive, the snakes, kind of doing what snakes do, running around,  killing people.  We got, uh, great snakes.  We got great victims.  And we got a really, you know, thrill ride for you if you come and see this thing.  Very good.  That's, uh, Sam Jackson talking about snakes on a plane.  Awesome.  That is, oh, my God.  Wow.  I'm trying to think in 38 years how many, like, bits of video I've seen or audio. 
[02:27:30]  Right, right.  That's arguably the worst thing I've ever heard.  Oh, my God.  You didn't even have to be there.  Wow.  And I kind of feel for Big Kev.  But yet the beauty of realizing that Sam Jackson hated him and then just going, okay, that  was Sam Jackson.  Kev.  Actually, you have a little more Kev tape right here.  All right.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  Now, why did you have any follow-up questions?  I was allowed one question. 
[02:28:00]  I had a minute and a half with him.  That was it.  And it was a lot of these.  It was the same one.  That was 45 seconds.  You still had 45 seconds.  Yeah.  Why did you ask a second question?  You could have got a second question.  Like, Sam, are you going to be doing Gator again?  You're right.  I should have did that.  You're right.  Huh?  No?  I'm just saying I was with all of the video people, the entertainment tonights and so on  and so forth.  And I was allowed to get one question in here and there.  Yeah.  And so that's what I did. 
[02:28:30]  Here comes the grade.  I made the best of a bad situation.  Here comes the grade.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  I wouldn't say you made the best of a bad situation.  I would say you took a bad situation and your nose dove.  I took lemons and made lemons.  You took lemons and you made cancer.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, well. 
[02:29:00]  Go home and get your fucking shine box.  Should we go with the...  No, let's just stop here.  No.  No.  No.  Big Hev.  No.  What interview do you think went well?  Or which interview do you think went well?  I wouldn't even hazard a guess.  Do you feel confident about your lost interview with the boys?  No, because I'm sure it's written there that it was awkward.  How about Hilary Swank?  Hilary Swank.  No, she's dead. 
[02:29:30]  Do you like your Hilary Swank interview?  Sure.  She was very badly raped, you see?  I swear I haven't heard these yet.  Swear to God.  So this is Big Kev.  I swear.  Okay, I believe you.  Big Kev talking to Hilary Swank.  Good evening.  Any refreshments there?  Try the wine. 
[02:30:00]  Food, all right?  Well, I think that I also, she said to Kev, you know, would you like to go somewhere with  me?  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  Good set up question I asked.  I fucking fail you, I am.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Big Kev and Hilary Swank.  Yeah.  All right, this is Big Kev at the Comic-Con.  I'm talking to multi-academy award winning Hilary Swank. 
[02:30:30]  Can you tell us about The Reaping?  The Reaping is a supernatural thriller that's really scary, you see it with a secret that  I can't reveal.  I love her.  Oh, secrets.  Secrets.  Very cool.  And did you have a lot of fun working on this one?  Oh.  A lot of fun.  I mean, it was also kind of sad too because we were in Louisiana during the two hurricanes  that hit.  So, we were probably three weeks into production when it happened and, you know, so we saw,  you know, a lot of devastation and a lot of hardship. 
[02:31:00]  Eek.  Yeah, sad.  All right, so we can look forward to The Reaping in November.  Yep.  Very cool.  Thanks, Hilary.  We found a new bit.  Goddamn rich cunts.  I kill rich cunts.  Big Kev's 45 second interview.  You know what you're saying?  You know, you just talked to Hilary, you talked to Hilary Swank and this is what you  got out of her.  Something about secrets, something about the movie she's doing called The Reaping.  But she can't tell you about the secrets because they're secrets. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  And she told you that it was pretty bad to be in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.  Yes.  All right.  But it was funny that the second question is, did you have fun working on it?  It was like, that was such a nervous Nellie question.  Like, that's the type of thing I would ask, so I can't shit on you.  Like, fun?  So, was the director nice?  How was, was everybody nice?  I like the eek.  Eek.  You actually used eek in an interview.  I bet he shrugged his dumb shoulders, too. 
[02:32:00]  Eek.  I'm trying to be playful.  Eek.  She's not fucking you stupid.  Eek.  You really are one step away from, oh, Hilary.  Tee hee hee.  Oh my God, you talked to Tobey Maguire?  I did.  From Spider-Man.  And you also talked to, uh, talked to, uh, Topher Grace?  Yes.  Who's Topher Grace?  I really don't know.  He's a kid from that 70s show.  He's also in the new Spider-Man.  Oh, okay.  Very cool.  But we got him before, uh, right, just before he took a, uh, break for lunch.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich.  Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry. 
[02:32:30]  Love those Diablo sandwiches.  It's so weird because you get, like, like you said, a minute, minute and a half.  Yeah.  But his interviews are 45 seconds because he's so nervous he just wants it to end.  Oh, is that funny?  Let's not forget also.  Let me set this up.  You don't have to.  Ant and I were in your position when we first started.  First started.  They come up to you and you're like, hummina, hummina, hummina.  We got abused by, what was that, Bill fucking Maher?  Bill Maher hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina.  Wrecked us. 
[02:33:00]  Never forgave him for it.  Nowadays, look back, laugh.  So, uh, wasn't it fun working on that movie?  So you're just sitting there going.  I'm not nervous about people.  What I'm nervous about is publicists who are standing there who are staring at me like,  you fucking better finish up.  Like, I literally like that.  You know, you got it.  See, you're a rookie still.  All right.  You got to learn from us.  Answer my question or you'll be standing tall before the man.  No, Big Kev.  Yes, sir.  Seriously.  I'm learning. 
[02:33:30]  I understand what you're saying.  I'm not trying to kill you too bad because your material is doing it for you.  What?  Hey, look, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm going to stick up with Big Kev.  The poignancy of that, like a lot of people might wonder, well, was it fun or not?  And you got right to the bottom of it.  Thank you, Jim.  But Big Kev, in the future, fuck the publicists.  We've been telling you that for years.  Know what the publicists say to me before I do these?  We've gotten some violent altercations with publicists over the years.  What do they say to you?  They post, oh, I know Roland who works on the show.  And that's the last.  Who cares? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, who cares?  I'm terrified of that.  Who cares?  Just you keep talking until they have to uncomfortably pull the guest away from the mic as the audio is rolling.  Open with this.  Taking mental news.  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would the word of God.  You should have said that to Sam and then looked at him, like, with eye contact, like, now it's his turn.  Answer my question or you'll be standing tall before the man.  Dean in Philly.  Dean.  Oh, and hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, my favorite part about that Hilary Swank interview was after she talked about the devastation in Louisiana, Big Kev's reply was eek. 
[02:34:30]  Yes, the eek.  Eek.  Eek.  Eek.  Eek.  He was trying, like Jimmy said, to be, like, coy.  And playful.  And playful.  Like, eye contact, like, yeah, I hear you, it was kind of bad.  And then you missed the next question.  No, I think it was more like he was...  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Do you want to kiss me?  I think it was more like he was getting info that he didn't know about in New Orleans.  Eek.  Eek.  That was his idea of empathizing with tragedy.  Eek.  Eek.  Again, I'm watching these, they go down a row of people, and I am the last or second-to-last person in the row. 
[02:35:00]  And I see that the way that these other people are, these other interviewers are handling and treating them.  And using that as a way to eek.  And they're using, they're very, they're very cold and calculating, and we want to know this and this.  Well, we have the interview before you and how he handled that same question that you answered, eek.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Now that sounds a lot more...  Tragic. 
[02:35:30]  How'd your parents die?  Oh, eek.  You fucking nervous Nelly.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's it.  You can get your eek t-shirts.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  That's geekstuff.com.  Oh, that's hilarious.  All right, here we go.  Eek.  Topher Grace from Spider-Man 3.  What do you think about all those kids dying over there in Lebanon?  Yikes. 
[02:36:00]  Yowie.  Oh, yeah.  Watch him a call it.  Whoopsie.  Topher Grace from Spider-Man 3.  This is Big Kev.  I'm here at the Comic-Con with Topher Grace, the upcoming Spider-Man 3.  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  Good to be here.  And I know you've read the comics your whole life, and especially through the generation  of your character, and so how do you feel about stepping into that role?  You know, it's nerve-wracking.  What are you, fucking Charlie?  I had a lot of confidence because of Sam, Ramey, and basically the whole same team, you know, 
[02:36:30]  with Toby and Kirsten, James, all returning, the same writer and producer, so I feel like  it's a great show that I was lucky enough to guest star on, you know?  Are you excited?  Yeah, man.  I just wish to watch the whole thing they're showing here.  I mean, I almost wet my pants.  It's unbelievable.  Excellent.  Topher Grace, Spider-Man 3.  Thank you, sir.  Wow.  Publicers are going to be mad at you for not being edgy enough.  Yeah, the first time they're actually angry. 
[02:37:00]  Could you be a little more confrontational?  Topher Grace.  Hey, how do you feel about breathing?  Is it good?  Spider-Man?  Last year when I did this, it was all over-modulated.  You have an NPR delivery.  That's awful.  Just take your beating.  I'm taking it.  This is god-awful.  I'm taking it.  And we all know it.  There's nothing you could say.  Yeah.  It just sounds silly trying to defend yourself.  That's right.  Topher Grace.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  All right.  Here. 
[02:37:30]  Here's the big interview with Tobey Maguire.  Here it is.  Remember, Spider-Man himself.  He gets a minute and a half with all these people.  This interview goes 56 seconds.  Oh.  All right.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to,  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to make it go away.  Make him leave immediately.  Oh, wait.  Wait till after.  I'll tell you what happened.  With Tobey?  No.  With Kirsten Dunst.  Kirsten Dunst?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Little problem?  Oh, yeah.  Nice teaser.  Really?  All right.  That's a great teaser.  Please tell me you called her a cunt.  Oh. 
[02:38:00]  No, sir.  We have a reason, though, why these interviews are so short.  Why?  I think you were a little preoccupied, Kev.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a good question at the table.  That's it.  Here we go.  Tobey Maguire.  Hey, you got Tobey Maguire on our show.  I did.  Yeah.  Impressive.  I say, Kev is out there trying to make things happen.  And Sam Jackson, too.  Fucking Spider-Man.  Bryan Singer.  Kev's a good boy. 
[02:38:30]  Well, he's not on our show yet.  Not yet.  We're deciding if we should play that one yet.  I really insult him, so.  Oh.  All right.  Jeez.  So, it's Big Kev.  I'm here with Tobey Maguire, the star of all the Spider-Man films, including the upcoming  number three.  How are you, sir?  I'm very good.  How are you?  Are you very excited to finally be making this third?  If you ask one more fucking plain Jane question, I'm going to mush my banana on your forehead.  How about you listen to what he's saying?  He asked how you were doing.  So, are you excited? 
[02:39:00]  I don't have time to answer this.  So, are you excited?  No, I'm kind of bummed out.  You're hoping it only goes to the big paycheck of the new big film.  One of the big blockbusters of all time.  Not exciting.  Two of the movies we've put out already over this subject have been huge.  I really believe this is going to be a massive bomb.  This will be the end of my career.  So, it's Big Kev.  I'm here with Tobey Maguire, the star of all the Spider-Man films, including the upcoming  number three.  How are you, sir?  I'm very good.  How are you? 
[02:39:30]  Are you very excited?  Oh, wow.  Way to connect.  Way to make it sound like it.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Moondays.  Oh, you are a horse's platoon.  Eek.  Eek.  Eek.  Eek.  Eek. 
[02:40:00]  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  Yeah, it is.  Hey, they're big names.  That's right.  They are big names.  You know what I can't.  And I'm not saying I would have confronted them, but are you excited?  Well, I like to listen.  I'm learning.  To make Kev not connect with his guests.  I've got to hear that again.  And how are you?  He just moves right on.  So, it's Big Kev.  I'm here with Tobey Maguire, the star of all the Spider-Man films, including the upcoming number three.  How are you, sir?  I'm very good.  How are you? 
[02:40:30]  Are you very excited to finally be making this third very exciting edition of the film?  Oh, oh.  I am.  I think that, you know, the storylines we have and the various kind of dynamics that the different characters go through  and how it all sort of relates to the history of what we've done in the first two movies has really been interwoven pretty well.  And so, if you've seen the other two, there's definitely some payoff in this movie. 
[02:41:00]  You know, it's just interesting when there's that kind of complexity and intelligence put into, you know, a summer movie meant to entertain people.  Excellent.  Thanks so much, Toby, for the time.  Are you shook up?  Are you nervous?  Excellent.  Thanks so much.  Great time.  This is Big Kev with Light 105 NPR.  Big Kev.  Yeah.  We're going to talk about cranberries.  Watching the Hindenburg coming to Lakehurst, New Jersey. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, my God.  It's bursting of flames.  The humanity.  The humanity.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Kirsten Dunst, what's the story?  So, we're in a room, like I said, and they have all the camera cruisers lined up, and I'm sort of at the end.  And they're kind of...  They're kind of weaving the people from Spider-Man around.  Sam Raimi, Kirsten Dunst, Dallas, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Tover Grace and Tobey Maguire. 
[02:42:00]  And as they're weaving them around, there's a small Chinese lady who keeps looking at me very suspiciously.  And she finally comes over, and she just does one of those, I'm directly staring at the badge of who you are.  And then she walks over to the publicist who's handling the room.  Yeah.  And she comes over to me and goes, hi, are you supposed to be in here?  And I'm like, yeah, obviously, I've just interviewed four or five of the people who are supposed to be in here. 
[02:42:30]  Well, perhaps they didn't consider those interviews.  And they said, yeah, Kirsten's publicist would like you to leave.  Goddamn rich cunt.  And I said, why?  And she says, because of who you're with.  Yeah, we're going to have to ask you to leave.  Hey, she knows us.  Oh, because of the Opie and Anthony connection?  Yeah, because it said Opie.  Nice.  Sweet.  All right.  Well, who's Kirsten's publicist?  I don't know who it was.  I think that's pretty easy information to find out.  Why wouldn't Kirsten Dunst? 
[02:43:00]  No reason.  Especially after I just talked to everybody else in the room and there wasn't a problem at all.  So there's the publicist.  This is where publicists should be executed.  This show has a massive listening audience, you fucking dumb bitch.  And you're going to get an interview with one of your people on.  And because you have a personal problem with something that's happened on this show, you decide to throw your weight around.  Well, you know why?  Fucking dummy.  It was all the controversial questions that Kev was asking.  Yeah, exactly.  That was it entirely. 
[02:43:30]  That edgy stuff like that.  They got wind of it.  How are you?  Are you excited to be doing this role again?  Excited?  Oh, she thought Kev was with melatonin.  All right, here we go.  Should we do the Bryan Singer interview?  Bryan Singer, director of Superman and House.  I have about this much dignity left, so let's just...  Did you leave, actually?  Stomp it.  What?  Do you have to leave?  I did.  They asked me to leave and I left.  This interview is...  Wow.  We have to find out who her publicist is.  This interview is a minute, eight seconds long. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  So this is Big Kev from the Opie and Anthony show.  We're talking to Bryan Singer, the director of Superman.  Bryan, are you enjoying all the success of the film?  Yeah, it's been fun, particularly here at Comic-Con, because it's sort of...  I make a strange distinction between the audience and the fans.  The fans are the ones that, like or don't, they'll be there to support you.  They want you to succeed and they love this character.  And so to have that kind of relationship and to foster that kind of relationship and continue 
[02:44:30]  it and actually have a physical interface with the fans is really exciting.  And when they like what you did, then it's even more exciting.  We're also big fans of the show House.  And how did you get involved with that real quick?  Well, it came through Universal Television.  I had a relationship with Paul Adonacio, one of the executive producers, and I came  on board and I directed the pilot and cast it and one of the executive producers and 
[02:45:00]  involved in it as much as humanly possible and love it.  And I can promise you one thing, House is not going to get any nicer.  Excellent, sir.  Thank you very much.  There you go.  Let's go to Scott in New York.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey, Scott.  Hey, this guy sounds like he should be calling a golf game.  Big Kev should be calling a golf game?  Yeah.  He needs to...  Yikes, he missed the four or three. 
[02:45:30]  He, uh...  Yeah.  What happened?  Then I got my checkup today.  I think I got to get the finger in the ass again.  It's been a year already.  Can you believe it?  You're not supposed to get it every year.  Do you get it every year?  Yeah.  I'm not from the chiropractor.  No, they check your...  Really?  It's not every year?  Don't get my hopes up.  I don't think so. 
[02:46:00]  No, you don't have to get it every year.  I do it every three months.  They actually go in.  Now it's two fingers.  Yeah.  Every year.  By the fifth year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're going to swirl them around the way a kid swirls a spoon around the mixing bowl.  Can I lick the beaters?  You guys want to learn about Lost?  I don't know, man.  These confrontational questions, I'm afraid we'll never get a guest again.  Yeah, I know.  He's blowing it for everybody.  I got good show ideas from all these people as well.  Oh, that's terrific.  I want the snooze channel. 
[02:46:30]  So this is Daniel Day Kim and Jorge Garcia from Lost.  Yeah.  The question is...  What is the question?  I asked if they knew.  Here's the question.  Another Big Kev celebrity interview.  All right.  This is Big Kev from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And I'm here with Daniel Day Kim and Jorge Garcia from the Monst...  Why do you feel you got to talk so soft?  No one has asked you.  Yeah.  Because the room has a lot of people.  Not only that, but last year when I did these, they were very over-modulated and loud, so 
[02:47:00]  I figure if I brought my voice down a little...  Right.  Smooth jams.  That's smart.  Here on WDULL.  The monster television show Lost.  How are you guys doing?  Good, thanks.  You?  Doing great.  Great.  I have two quick questions.  I can answer for you.  How are you?  And that is, number one, do you guys know?  We know? 
[02:47:30]  I'd say Jorge knows.  What?  I don't know nothing.  No?  No?  Don't know the answers?  They're just keeping you all in the dark as well?  Yeah.  Just anxious, waiting for that first script for season three to just kind of like see where  we're starting off.  It's better we don't know.  It's better that way because then we don't have to lie and we can just say, hey, talk to  the writers.  That's very cool.  Guys, it's the guys from Lost here with Big Kevin at Comic-Con in San Diego.  It's not very cool, Big Cubby. 
[02:48:00]  Here's some advice, Kev.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  Isn't this great?  Yeah, I should remember.  Oh, well, Kev has another interview coming up very shortly with two stars of a...  Yeah, could you do the next interview for us?  Yeah.  Please?  Sure.  Yeah.  Thanks.  There's the...  We're going to be talking to what?  The girls from Descent?  Yes.  Yep.  Sean McDonald.  It's a horror movie.  Yes.  The girls are beautiful.  They're outside the studio.  And Natalie Jackson and Mendoza.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  The last celebrity interview from Big Kev is Eva Mendes.  Hello.  Hello.  Is this thing on?  Hello.  I love to...  The beautiful thing is watching these interviews unravel before they get started.  So, did you have fun?  And the guy's like, ugh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Eek.  All right.  Eva Mendes from Ghost Rider?  Eek.  Yes.  Ghost Rider.  She was also in Hitch.  You might remember her.  She was in Ghost Rider?  And she was in Crash as well?  You should have had her jot down a few interesting questions. 
[02:49:00]  No?  All right.  Come on.  Crash him.  That wasn't that bad.  Sam enjoyed it.  She pretends she knows about comics in this clip.  She's pretending she knows about comics, right, Big Kev?  I don't know.  Is that what Sam wrote?  This is Big Kev.  Yeah, Sam did write some...  Spinning some Hot Wax this evening.  Yeah.  This is a Marvin Gaye song.  Hold on.  Well, getting shot is preferred to listening to these.  Hold on. 
[02:49:30]  John in Indiana wants to talk to us.  John?  John.  Hello, boys.  Welcome aboard.  Hey, John.  Thank you.  I'm here with a .38 caliber pistol.  I just need a reason to live, so I...  You don't have one.  Pull it.  Are you excited about me wanting to shoot myself?  Very.  I'm extremely excited.  How does that make you feel?  I used to be in light radio, and this is worse than what I used to do on the air,  so I just wanted to tell him he's in good company.  Fantastic.  Great. 
[02:50:00]  Thank you for calling.  Thanks for...  Thanks for giving us a call today, ringing us up.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bear, the trucker Bear.  Bear, are you excited to be on the phone with us?  What's up, Bear?  Oh, yeah.  It's a great day.  Yeah.  Skies are clear, and the grass is smooth today.  Thanks a lot, Bear.  How does it feel being under the blue sky?  Oh, it feels great out here.  The crowd's excited.  We got Tiger Woods possibly coming out today.  Thanks a lot, Bear.  How's the...  What are you hauling? 
[02:50:30]  What are you hauling in your truck?  I just unloaded a load of the non-alcoholic drink mixes.  Oh, nice.  Cool.  That's great.  That's great.  We'll make a hell of a party.  Where?  To Mel Gibson's house?  I want to go to that party.  It's a little joke thrown in.  I couldn't resist actually being funny.  Bear, the trucker?  You have a question for Big Kev?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was wondering, you guys were talking about what was the MTV Music Awards?  Yeah.  If you were going there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You should definitely send him over there to do some interviews, whether you're invited or not. 
[02:51:00]  He does sound like a golf announcer.  Wow.  What a great idea.  Holla.  Holla.  That's a great idea.  We're going to send Big Kev to the MTV Music Awards.  Sure.  August 31st here in New York City.  I'll go.  All right.  I also wanted to tell you guys, I saw Clerks 2 over the weekend.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  Little Jimmy's kick-ass about Lucky Louie.  Hey, hey, hey.  Settle down.  You're a little too energetic with your review of Clerks 2 and Lucky Louie. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  We understand people like them.  Sorry about that.  But we don't like...  Start a film like a soccer announcer.  Hopefully it was a good review of Lucky Louie because it was a bad review.  Well, we don't want to hear that.  Jimmy, I'm reading a lot of instant feedbacks coming in and other comments and people are  just praising the show.  Oh, all right.  Thinking it's fantastic.  Are you excited about being on it?  Yeah.  You know, we worked hard on it.  We all...  We had like...  We cared about each other and, you know, it was a good place and, you know.  That's great.  All right.  That's great.  All right.  Thanks, Jim Norton, for talking to us about Lucky Louie. 
[02:52:00]  Thank you.  Sunday night.  You've heard my show.  Hey, hey, hey.  Don't get too loud here on WSUK.  You've heard my show, Ant.  You know I'm not like that on my show.  I've heard your podcasts and you do throw in a little more energy there.  Do you?  Yes, just a bit.  Just a bit.  All right.  Thank you, Bear.  But this segment ain't about your fucking podcast.  All right.  You guys, that's a good one.  So you can take your podcast.  Anything to get us out of this segment, I'm willing to do that.  Yeah.  Hey, I heard your podcast.  All I can see is eek.  We got Eric in Bethlehem.  Eric, you're on with Big Kev. 
[02:52:30]  Hey, guys.  It's always a pleasure.  Always a pleasure.  Direct from the Holy City.  That's wonderful.  Hey, Eric, how are you?  How are you holding up there with all the bombs flying around you?  Yeah, the bombs flying around you?  Are you close to the action?  Are you excited about all the bombs?  I'm just trying to stay alive, guys.  I wish you wouldn't make light of it.  Eek.  Oh, eek.  Eek.  Eek.  He's in Pennsylvania.  Eek.  Okay, our mistake, our mistake.  Eek.  I'm sitting here trying to enjoy a white bread sandwich with some mayonnaise and a glass of  skim milk.  Very tasty.  How was it making that?  Was it fun making that?  Mayonnaise is the other guy's bit, sir. 
[02:53:00]  It was taxing making this sandwich, guys.  Did you use a butter knife or a serrated knife?  Oh, good question.  A lot of times I'll spread the mayo with a serrated knife just so I could use it later  to cut the sandwich in two instead of wasting two knives.  Comment on that, Eric?  You know something?  Serrated knives, they pose a little bit of a threat to me.  I'm really more of a finger in the mayo guy.  Oh, wow.  You're way out there.  I don't think we can even talk to you. 
[02:53:30]  That's a little too far out there.  What Eric wants to do today on the program is have an interview off with Big Kev.  Oh, does he?  Eric, do you know anything about the new movie Descent coming out?  Actually, I know nothing about it.  Do you have a computer nearby?  You can do some quick research?  Big Kev's doing quick research because he's going to interview the ladies.  I can, in fact, do some quick research for you, Opie.  All right, we're going to put you on hold so you can challenge Kev to an interview off after the break.  Gee, that's exciting, Opie.  It's going to be Big Kev and Eric using their real voices, by the way. 
[02:54:00]  Yes, yes.  Yes, we're going to come out of this doldrum and bring the excitement back to the show after the break.  Yes, we're going to kick it up a notch, guys.  Back to?  All right.  Didn't we start with Kev's segment?  Eric, you stay right there.  I'll be right here, guys.  All right, you've got to challenge him.  Stay right there.  You've got to challenge him, Big Kev.  He's challenging you.  All right, here we go.  Eva Mendez, Ghost Rider.  Pretend she knows about comics.  This should be terrific.  So it's Big Kev.  I'm here at Comic-Con.  I know.  It's really funny. 
[02:54:30]  I know.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  Wait until the next one.  Yeah, of course.  That's what you said last year.  All right, here we go.  Love it.  So it's Big Kev.  I'm here at Comic-Con with Eva Mendez from the upcoming film Ghost Rider.  So the question I want to ask you is, were you able to study a lot of the source material  before committing to this project?  No, and I'll tell you why.  Oh.  Not because I'm not studious in that way.  I just, there was a major character change. 
[02:55:00]  I know in the original, in the comic book, Roxanne Simpson, who I play in this film, was actually  Johnny Blaze's stepsister.  And he actually sold his soul to save my father, who was raising him.  So it was kind of weird because they ended up being in love, and they were stepbrother,  stepsister.  Quiet.  But they weren't blood, you know.  So my director, I'll do that, but he thought people might not be real.  Audiences might not quite take to that. 
[02:55:30]  So, um.  Quiet.  That would be creepy.  It's kind of creepy.  But I'm glad the story changed because then I got to do it.  Very cool.  And what do you think about being in a comic book movie?  Is it exciting?  It's really exciting.  Especially when, like, um.  Is it exciting?  Especially when, because the story is so great.  No, it sucks.  When the story and the visuals match up to one another, and it's not just some visual piece,  or it's not just, like, some boring story.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I love when both stand together, and that's what I'm really excited about on this  one.  Eek.  Excellent.  Eva Mendez from Ghost Rider. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  It's an exciting.  God, please do this same bit every time.  We love it.  No problem.  Yep.  Do the exact delivery.  No problem.  If you ever get good at this, you're out.  You're so out.  All right.  You're going to do, uh.  You're going to help us with the interview with the Descent Girls next.  Hi.  I'm Big Kev.  We're here with, uh.  Drunken racist Mel Gibson.  Mel, were you excited when you got arrested for your DEWI?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Mel, how do you feel?  Jews. 
[02:56:30]  Eek.  Jews.  Eek.  Oh, here comes the music.  Time to get back into the Jews.  The big camp delivery here.  Mel, did a kike write this music?  It sounds sort of Jewish.  Yeah.  How drunk were you?  Uh-uh.  Why didn't you just jump into the whole, uh, Jew thing to a cop who was just busting you?  Yeah.  Well, that was Mel Gibson.  A drunken racist Mel Gibson.  We will, uh, continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Troll up next.  Through the side wall of Comic-Con here. 
[02:57:00]  After, uh, these important words.  Eek.  And messages.  Eek.  Yikes.  And commercials.  And promos.  Can't wait to get them.  Commercials and promos.  Hollabaloo.  About stuff you don't give a shit about.  The Giants win the pennants.  The Giants win the pennants.  As we go.  The Giants win the pennants.  As we go.  The Giants win the pennants.  As we go take our dumps.  Yeah.  Listen to these boring messages.  Yeah.  Hey, what's that? 
[02:57:30]  Well, you've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock.  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock.  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can buck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock.  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the centerpiece of any party. 
[02:58:00]  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  Is...  Is...  Is that fucking rock, you dildo?  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We've just been informed that we made the Chicago Sun-Times.  Yes, we were telling you on the first half of the Opie and Anthony show, we're going to be live in Chicago. 
[02:58:30]  And we're also going to be on in San Francisco starting tomorrow.  The O&A virus continues to spread.  And it spreads big time tomorrow.  Very excited to have a shot at morning radio in Chicago.  It's a biggie if you're doing radio.  It's a biggie.  WCKG.  WCKG, that's right.  And the Chicago Sun-Times is already talking about it and made today's paper.  I thought it was kind of a secret, to be honest with you, but I guess... 
[02:59:00]  I didn't know they were waking up with the news in Chicago.  Dismal ratings put Rover in doghouse.  In doghouse.  That's one thing, when you pick a radio name, you really got to watch it.  Because when you're Rover, they could use the dog references.  Yeah, but they could go with the...  Opie and Anthony is Opie and Dopey.  We've been through that.  Yeah, but Rover could have been like he had a ferocious bite.  Yeah, you think?  He takes a bite out of ratings.  That's the one.  There you go. 
[02:59:30]  But then it's like Rover in doghouse.  Tails not wagging at CBS over Rover.  Oh, yeah.  Rover gives pause for, you know, plenty of time to sit home and lick his balls.  Well, and...  No?  Well, here's one that starts...  Rover ate his own shit.  Here's one that starts off the article, it's over for Rover.  It's over for Rover.  Rover, like, you got to watch when you pick your name.  What rhymes with it?  No, no, no, that's what you have to watch for.  Yeah, yeah.  For headlines, you're going to rhyme. 
[03:00:00]  You got to pick the orange show.  I was going to try to figure out how a derogatory term for black people rhymed with Rover.  Coming out of your mouth, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  What rhymes with it?  I'm thinking, hmm, hit this button.  Dismal ratings put Rover in doghouse.  It's over for Rover.  And we like the guy, but we got to read this article.  Yeah.  Word.  We have to.  I like him a lot, actually.  Rover put to sleep.  And we do like the guy.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  Dismal ratings put Rover in doghouse.  It's over for Rover. 
[03:00:30]  One of the biggest bombs in Chicago radio history.  At least he made history.  I'm reading this.  The morning show, hosted by Shane Rover French, is about to be replaced by the New York-based  syndicated duo of Greg Opie-Hughes and Anthony Cumia.  CBS Radio is expected to pull the plug today on Rover's morning glory after eight months  of microscopic ratings on WCKG.  You don't want to have microscopic ratings.  No.  Goddamn.  That's rough.  Although today will be his last day on the air in Chicago, French is expected to continue 
[03:01:00]  in about a dozen other markets, including his former home base of Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Can he just, like, go back to Cleveland and broadcast?  That's probably what he'll do.  Yeah?  I'm sure he's going to.  He actually went to Chicago, right?  Did they actually?  Yeah.  Yeah, because he really went there to Chicago.  He wanted him to fit in.  That's a bitch.  That's his thing.  He's got to go back.  Well, they've been there for eight months, too.  I mean, I wonder if anything.  They probably just rented apartments, but.  I don't know.  I don't know how that works.  Yeah, I don't think that sucks.  Yikes.  I think he does his show from Cleveland tomorrow. 
[03:01:30]  I think that's how that's going to happen.  Oh, really?  Mark Burnett's here, too.  We didn't even get to the other girls.  My boy, God.  A duo fired over church sex show.  Really?  It's like another headline within the article.  French came here to replace Howard Stern, the self-styled king of all media, who signed  off at the end of last year to move to satellite radio.  French never caught on with the young male audience.  He was hired to attract or with anyone else, for that matter.  Jeepers.  In the latest Arbitron quarterly survey, he plunged to a 0.3, a 0.3% share of men between 
[03:02:00]  the ages of 18 and 34.  Mr. Blutowski.  That's rough.  And was largely responsible for WCKGs finishing dead last among every major station in the  market with an all-time low, 0.9% share overall.  The ouster of Man Cow from Amos Communications earlier this month offered French a brief glimmer 
[03:02:30]  of hope.  Despite running print and television ads to capitalize on Man Cow's demise, CBS radio bosses ultimately  concluded that the situation at WCKG was hopeless.  Starting Tuesday, WCKG will revamp its lineup throughout the day.  And then it gives the lineup, which includes us, airing from 6 to 9 a.m.  Opie and Anthony made headlines in 2002 when they were fired for airing a couple having  sex in a vestibule of New York St. Patrick's Cathedral as part of a contest. 
[03:03:00]  Blah, blah.  Just in case you didn't know.  Blah, blah.  They resurfaced on XM's satellite radio.  Resurfaced like sludge in a tank.  So there you have it.  That's pretty cool.  Let's get the girls in from the new horror movie.  Uh, let's say hi to Chris in Los Angeles.  Chris.  Hey to Chris.  Chicago should actually run something like Opie Kicks Rover in the Liver.  Oh, there you go.  You've been known to well. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  You know.  All right, let's go to Julie in Wisconsin.  Julie.  Julie.  Hey, I was just wondering if you were excited to be back in Chicago.  Uh, absolutely.  Yeah, very exciting to be back in Chicago.  We never really, we were on in Chicago at the same station, but we would get pretty  preempted for minor league hockey at night.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yep.  Back in the old days.  We were, we were horrible.  Yeah.  They would, they would not play our show when they had a minor league hockey game to play  in a city that has NHL hockey.  That's how awful our, our, uh, shift was. 
[03:04:00]  So yeah, we're very excited this time around, Julie.  Here's where we turn into blithering idiots.  Here's where we turn into idiots.  Why?  Fuck.  I don't want to look behind you.  I can't look.  No, I don't want to look.  I can't do it.  Let me give you a little rundown, ladies.  We, um.  I don't want to look.  This is like a, this is like a stupid boys club thing.  And girls are very intimidating.  And we, um, we can't really function very well in front of pretty girls.  We stink.  And beautiful women are in the studio. 
[03:04:30]  Like when guys come in, we're all just yapping like idiots.  And then girls come in and we don't know what to say.  We don't know how to ask things.  Because we raise the tone.  Yeah, it does.  It just, it smells nicer in here.  The girls are in here.  It's just, it's a nasty, dirty, ick, locker room.  I'm no longer Jim Norton on the radio.  I'm little dumb Jimmy in high school.  Yeah.  And these are the two I want to talk to and I can't.  And we went out with the older boys.  Oh, of course.  Or the boys with chins.  The better looking boys.  I went out with Darkie Jimmy from the, you know. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, did you?  Yeah, I was in.  Yeah, definitely.  I like that.  I'm not even going to walk by and they trip you with,  your lunch tray.  And they laugh at my tiny genitals.  All right, everyone.  All day long they're just wearing their cheerleader uniform for some reason.  We go out with the jocks.  Is that what you call them?  Yeah, go out with the jocks.  Jocks.  Jocks.  Jocks.  Jocks, where are you from, dear?  I'm from Scotland.  Scotland.  Yes.  But we don't have jocks, really.  You have sort of the musicians in school and they're cooler to go out there. 
[03:05:30]  But that was like one of the cliques, you know.  There was the jocks and then the musicians and the potheads and stuff like that.  Yeah, yeah.  I went to a Catholic convent school.  Oh, you did?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  You're looking at them.  You're looking at them.  Oh, sorry.  Maybe if we all turn around and we can do a real interview.  What, not looking?  No, because I can't look.  I can't do it.  I just can't.  I know what it is.  Just turn around.  We try and we get very intimidated.  We are blithering dope. 
[03:06:00]  So, you're in a movie.  With six girls.  Are you excited?  Six girls.  Very excited.  Can I start the interview?  Imagine if we were all in here.  You wouldn't be able to see anything.  Oh, forget about it.  Go over.  Can I start the interview because I haven't seen him yet?  Yes.  Okay.  So, why are you whores in the studio?  Oh, my God!  See, we were warned.  We were warned about you.  He can say it because he hasn't looked.  See, I can say it because I haven't seen you yet.  You look and then let me see what comes out of your filthy mouth, you potty mouth. 
[03:06:30]  Now I have to turn around and look at them.  Look at the girls.  See how much easier it is?  Do you have to tell us something about the time you were at school and none of the pretty  girls talked to you?  You're just trying to get your own butt.  Isn't that what it is?  We'll be your friend, though.  He weighed 15 pounds until college.  That was his problem.  I'll turn around.  Look.  Look at them.  We won't take your dinner money.  Oh, I think you're quite cute as well.  You don't need to be horrible.  Holy shit, they're hot.  I'm turning back around. 
[03:07:00]  It's very difficult for us.  I didn't go out with girls like you in high school.  Did you go out with boys instead?  Nailed.  Hey, you don't want me to start acting, do you?  You can hang.  All right.  I'll turn around.  No, Big Kev's here.  Big Kev's going to interview the girls.  Sure.  I can handle it.  Oh, wow.  That's Big Kev.  He was out in San Diego doing interviews with the likes of, throw out some names.  Were you guys at Comic-Con?  No.  No, you weren't.  San Diego?  I think maybe a couple of the other girls.  It's like a big press junket thing that they do. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, right.  And then Tobey Maguire from Spider-Man, he spoke to Samuel L. Jackson, he spoke to Hilary  Swank.  So he's used to doing a lot of interviews with celebrities, so maybe we should just leave  it to Kev because we are pretty in it.  And we have another guy.  Actually, we have another guy on the line that wants to challenge him to an interview off.  Yeah, like an interview contest kind of thing.  Who gets the first question, you or the guy?  I think Big Kev has to get the courtesy of the first question.  All right.  Big Kev.  I'll pass to Big Kev. 
[03:08:00]  Big Kev, first question to you.  So you guys are in The Descent, which is Neil Marshall's second film after doing Dog  Soldiers, which was an incredible horror movie.  Did you guys get to see Dog Soldiers?  Did you know what you were getting into?  Yeah, we were forced to watch it with Neil.  Yeah, he actually tied us to the chairs and we had to actually sit there and watch the entire  film and tell him that we absolutely loved it.  And him.  But Dog Soldiers is much funnier later and it's all guys and Dog Soldiers.  It's squaddies. 
[03:08:30]  So we got a point of reference, but then he said we're going, our film is going to be  a lot more horrific and darker than Dog Soldiers.  It's a lot darker.  Yeah, you can tell that from the trailers that are out.  Yeah.  Yeah, they show the things.  All right.  That was a good start.  Hold on.  I wanted to jump in.  She's talking.  I'm not going to talk.  She's going to talk.  You've got to know when to cut off the guest.  Oh.  Sorry.  I'm learning.  When to cut off the guest. 
[03:09:00]  When should I cut off the guest?  I'm just kidding.  Couldn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to cut off the host's head.  Oh, sorry.  In a second.  See, Opie really fast as us.  He's going to ping our brass straps in a minute.  Oh.  All right.  Ping.  And pull our hair.  I didn't interrupt.  Were you done?  Because I can't concentrate because you're hot.  Were you guys done with that question?  So done.  Yeah.  We're done.  All right.  Let's say hi to Eric.  Eric's got the next question.  Eric Bethlehem.  Yes.  As far as the movie goes, ladies, I see that it is set in the Appalachians. 
[03:09:30]  Yes.  Now, I noticed the movie was filmed in Scotland.  Yes.  Now, what was that like for you guys to try to put on American accents, or have you had  experience with that before?  Oh, my God.  Great question, Eric.  Great question.  Wow.  Ladies.  It's a great question because only one of us has an American accent.  That's me, Natalie.  You're from Scotland?  No, she's Australian.  No, I'm Australian.  I was born in Hong Kong, raised in Australia.  Wow.  Educated in London, partly.  How confused are you right now? 
[03:10:00]  Very confused.  And the accent wasn't a problem.  Who do you root for in the war?  You've got all sides covered.  Thank God.  Mel Gibson would hate you.  Too much going on there.  Too much.  Way too much.  And I was brought up Catholic.  Can I hear a line in the American accent?  Pardon?  Can I hear one of your lines in American accent?  Oh, which line?  I can...  Say, right.  Oh.  Oh, round.  I was quite impressed with that.  I have to say, root. 
[03:10:30]  We say, I found another root out of the...  We call it a cock.  Yeah.  You call it a cock, but I was...  A root.  But a route.  You say route.  Okay.  Yeah.  A cock is an uptick.  I have...  I kind of live here.  Oh, in America?  No.  Why?  Is that what it's called in Australia?  I'm Scottish.  Oh.  Scottish.  I thought someone was from Australia.  I'm Australian.  Oh, right.  Okay.  I've got a really mixed accent.  The one that was born in Hong Kong is from Australia.  No, we've got Irish accent, English accent, Scottish, Swedish, and American accent. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Accent.  Nice.  But the actresses are English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, Swedish, Australian.  All right.  They just make them that.  Did you get your answer, Eric?  I got my answer to that question.  That was a great question.  All right.  Big question.  Kev.  That was a good question.  The first thing I was going to ask her is to do the accent.  It's interesting to hear someone pull off an American accent.  Yeah.  And he actually asked it.  Yes.  Eric, you were very observant.  Way to pick up on that.  Thank you very much.  It's very important when you're an interviewer to pick up on the obvious. 
[03:11:30]  Kev.  You're up.  You're up, Kev.  You can see a lot in the trailer and the footage that they've shown that it's a lot  of cave climbing and so on and so forth.  Any of you guys have any experience with that before going into the film?  Because obviously it looks very, it looks a lot of tight spaces.  We did like a boot camp, like a two week boot camp of claiming, caving, climbing, whitewater  rafting.  Why are you so bored?  Is this a boring question?  No. 
[03:12:00]  Basically, he just asked if you were bats.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's funny.  Any experience living in caves?  All right.  No.  We did go caving for real, which is quite frightening.  No, they got ready for the film by doing some surfing.  What do you think?  Was it spelunking?  Spelunking, yeah.  Spelunking?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bukkake?  It was kind of a boot camp.  We ran another one like spelunking.  I don't know.  I don't know the terminology, but yeah, something like that.  In the caves in Derbyshire, right?  Yeah.  You know, there's an actual spelunking magazine called Descent. 
[03:12:30]  Ooh.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  So that was a good answer to a question.  Eric, it's to you again.  Eric?  Okay.  My next question that follows would be that since this movie is basically about you ladies  in a cave, how much was filmed on a soundstage and how much was filmed in an actual cave?  Oh, wow.  That's a great question.  Another great question, really, by Eric, because you do wonder this type of thing.  The majority of it was filmed in a soundstage, apart from the outdoor stuff. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  None of the caving was a cave.  That cave was sort of polystyrene.  Polystyrene blocks just being moved around.  Rearranged.  Makes you look like you're in a different part.  None of it is in a cave.  Very small budget for this horror film.  It was great acting.  I'm telling you, every time we ran down a different part of the tunnel, we'd actually  run down that part of the tunnel about 50 times.  We had to pretend it was a different part of the tunnel.  I got you.  It was like the Flintstones?  Yeah, it really was.  It's like Grandhog Day.  Yeah, same table for 400 miles.  Eric, great question. 
[03:13:30]  I don't think we learned something new about the film.  Thanks for that.  All right.  My pleasure.  To you.  You guys have, I was looking over your resume, and it seems like you haven't done a lot  of horror films, if any at all.  What was that experience like?  That's a nice insult, but go ahead.  Yeah, that was nice.  Hey, I saw the movie.  It was your first time.  Oh, well.  Nice question, Kev.  Excuses disrespect.  Hey, so did you ever do this before, or you just figured you'd show up?  It really comes off like you wung it. 
[03:14:00]  You were winging it, and...  Do you get bullied all the time?  Yes, all the time.  Oh, big Kev.  None of us had done it.  I don't think any of us had done a horror film before.  No.  But the cast are pretty unknown.  Of course, Natalie's a huge star, but apart from her, we're all pretty unknown.  I think that's what they wanted.  They wanted unknown, so we didn't have any baggage for the film, so nobody would know,  nobody would expect any of us to survive or die, whatever.  That, and they couldn't afford a big star.  We came cheap. 
[03:14:30]  Come on.  You guys made that question very interesting.  Thank you.  Eric, to you from Bethlehem.  Yes, my question is about the creature effects in the film.  Did any of you have to deal with any of these creatures in real life, or were they animatronics,  or were they added after in the computer?  There's very few special effects.  It's all makeup.  There's some special effects at the end where they sort of multiply, and they've got to  be climbing across the ceiling and things like that.  But it's all guys in suits and thongs, covering their bits. 
[03:15:00]  Guys not in suits, actually.  They're just covered in KY jelly.  In KY jelly.  That's actually the scariest part of the film.  Was Jimmy an extra?  What was that?  I don't know if our own little Jimmy was an extra.  He was trying to throw a hurtful comment at me.  Oh, dear.  It's all the testosterone in the room.  You're so cruel to each other.  Is it because you love each other so much?  When Natalie says someone's name, there's nothing sexier.  When she says, oh, big Kev.  And then she goes, oh, Jimmy, it's so sexy. 
[03:15:30]  It hurts me.  I'm really hot.  Stop trying.  I've got a question for the ladies.  Stop it.  What?  Stop trying.  Stop it.  They're not going to go out.  I know what you're trying.  What?  They're not going to go out with you.  They're not going to go out with you.  They're not going to go out with you.  Knock it all.  I would never want to date a married person.  Oh, you're married?  Oh.  First thing I looked at was the hand.  Very good.  What's that?  First thing a girl does is, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  I've got a question for the ladies.  What the hell is the movie about? 
[03:16:00]  Right.  That's a good question.  We know it's a horror film.  We know it's in, uh...  I'm going to cut you off there, Opie.  Oh, boy!  Hey, hey, hey.  Really?  You're going to take that, Opie.  Watch this.  Let's see who cuts off who.  We know it's a horror film.  We know it takes place in a cave.  What else could you give us?  Well, you don't want to give too much away.  It's a really strong storyline, basically, where there's six really close girlfriends,  and through tragic events that happen in the cave, their friendships and relationships start to fracture, 
[03:16:30]  and it brings out their primal instincts.  Nice.  And we kick ass and stuff.  Kind of like Lord of the Flies?  Do you always put, like, an object between you and the person you're interviewing?  So you don't get mad.  There's this big screen right in front of us.  Isn't that stupid?  I'm just leaning...  That is ridiculous.  I'm just leaning down to that.  See?  I'll set up.  Hi, Opie.  Hey, hey, hi.  I'm very calm down.  So it's kind of like Lord of the Flies?  Oh, that's a good way to put it, but... 
[03:17:00]  Thank you, thank you.  I've never...  That's good.  I've never heard that, actually.  I've never heard that.  It's a kind of...  We do a lot of homages to, you know, the Deliverance and Alien and not sight of what's shining and things.  Why are you guys in the cave to begin with?  Because we love...  We're sort of outdoor enthusiasts.  Oh, okay.  You know, we kick...  We're very strong sort of outdoor fanatics.  It's kind of my character's idea of putting them...  I've set up this trip to basically... 
[03:17:30]  So that we could all heal as a group because Shauna's character goes through this massive tragedy.  And I think it's a great way of bonding for all of us.  And, of course, it goes tragically.  Good idea.  Great thing.  I have an important question, by the way.  It wasn't such a good idea.  Can you tell us?  Are either of you...  Or is there any nudity in this?  Well, you know, I wanted there to be nudity, but no.  No.  No, there's no nudity.  No, there's no nudity.  There's no nudity.  No reason, really.  Let's get naked in the cave.  I could ask a lot of bad questions.  I may as well have been naked.  My costume was that tight.  What was the book put out by Vivid? 
[03:18:00]  You asked.  I didn't say it was a good question.  I'm liking a catsuit the whole way through, and it's wet, so it's kind of...  We're not far off, you know.  That's great.  What was the big tragedy that one of the girls went through?  Oh, well, it's my tragedy, too.  To get you guys together.  Yeah, well, at the very start of the film, there's a car crash, and it's not that great  an outcome.  And then it cuts to one year later, and I'm trying to get my life back together.  So I go to my friend Juno, and she's like, all right, let's go down the cave.  I'm like, that's great.  And we go down this cave, and then we get lost, and then we realize we're not the only  things in the cave, and it's a big, big fight off between us and the other people, and then 
[03:18:30]  it becomes a fight off between ourselves, and we all spiral down into hell and descend  into darkness.  But there's no nudity, because we didn't have to get our tits out, you see, to make it look  good.  That's it.  No, no, not that you have to, but as a guy...  I didn't have to rely on that.  As a guy...  Absolutely.  Sorry, Jimmy.  What?  Sorry it's not Porky's, Jimmy.  Yeah, but you know what?  I didn't say that.  It was necessary.  I happened to have thought there was a little vibe between us, and maybe there was some  nudity.  Movies have taken away our topless shots. 
[03:19:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Every movie used to have that one topless scene.  Yeah.  They don't do that anymore.  So great.  No, they don't.  Not so much.  Just a quick thing for the guys.  I'm sure they do in a lot of horror films.  Not really.  There's still a lot of wet t-shirts running around from the skinny guy with a knife.  There's a few indie movies out there that get pretty graphic.  I tend to enjoy a movie without nudity anymore, believe it or not, because I'm not concentrating  on the sexy aspect, I'm concentrating on the movie.  Oh, so you can follow the story like that.  I'm so easily distracted, and I actually prefer a movie without it.  Hey, you guys want to take more questions from the listeners? 
[03:19:30]  Shwuggie.  Shwuggie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Shwuggie.  I'm just wondering, with six holes working together, did you guys all get your periods  at the same time?  Oh, my God.  That's so filthy.  That's a great question, though.  Only a guy would even think of it.  Hold on.  Only a guy would.  Well, we hear us, guys, that you ladies will sync up.  Do you want the real answer to that question?  It takes a while for that to go ahead.  It's so lightening.  Okay.  Shwuggie, it's a good question.  They're a little shy, though, I think.  Oh, okay.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Randy. 
[03:20:00]  Randy, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Great movie.  I saw it.  I'm not going to tell you how I saw it, but I saw it.  Just one question for y'all.  Why did you go in the cave for the showing?  Wait, you had the preview or whatever, the premiere?  Yeah, I read about that, yeah.  I think it's called bootleg.  I see it legally, but anyway.  Who's from Scotland?  I am.  Shauna.  Freedom!  Wow, he's very excited.  What happened there?  He just yelled, freedom. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, freedom.  Yeah.  Yeah, only his bad funk and Italy.  It's like a good time coming back to William Wallace.  Right, right, of course.  Ryan in Jacksonville.  Ryan?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I wanted to ask a Scottish girl what she prefers.  Does she prefer a won't die till it quits William Wallace cock or a strong, firm American  cock like Jimmy Norton's?  Oh, my God.  It's so early, guys.  How can you talk about cock?  You know, you're so right.  A cup of coffee first.  What type of cock do you have? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, Ryan.  Yeah.  Come on.  Fess up.  Oh, what kind do I have?  I have a small Asian one.  Oh, well, I like big black ones there.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  These girls are all right.  We have Mark Burnett that has to come in.  He's on a very tight schedule.  Who isn't?  What cock do you like?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, I know.  What the fuck?  So the movie opens this Friday?  It does.  You've got to go.  You'll love it. 
[03:21:30]  And girls, please, if any girls listen to this, do they?  I'm not sure if they do.  You know, you are sharp, man.  Covering the males.  You can see, like, you know, this is just not about the female demo.  They can bring their girlfriends.  No, we've got more girls listening lately.  Yeah.  We've softened our delivery, actually.  The descent.  Have you softened it?  Have you softened it?  We have.  Were you scared?  This is a dumb question, but I'm going to ask it, because I've done some acting, but  I've never done a horror film.  Were you, like, scared doing it at all, or is it not scary while you're filming it?  Well, I always thought that the director would play a trick on us. 
[03:22:00]  Hold on a second.  Was that a bad question?  I really wanted to know that.  Why is no one bashing him?  Because I admit it was a bad question.  Because Jimmy's terrific.  Yeah.  And I didn't know.  He's just wonderful.  I'm sorry.  I did have horrendous nightmares while shooting the film, so I was more scared when I went back  home to my house in the dark.  But no, you know, it's all plastic sets.  Okay.  You know, it's fine.  There's so many people around.  Thank you.  There is a press review.  I got a question.  Oh, Opie.  I had a nightmare too.  I'll tell you about it later.  Is that about peniids or penises? 
[03:22:30]  No.  I didn't say that.  Those weren't my questions.  I got really good questions so far.  Okay.  Do you guys scream in the movie?  Oh, you want us to scream?  Yeah.  Well, you got to take one at a time, though.  No, both.  No, you want to do both at a time?  One at a time, and then both.  Okay.  This could sell the film.  Yeah.  The film's already sold, mate.  One, two, three.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's loud.  I've heard that sound before.  Just one date. 
[03:23:00]  Can we chase you around the studio and you guys just scream?  Can we chase you around the studio and you just scream?  That would happen.  Please stop.  Can we have Jimmy chase you and you scream?  That would be so much fun.  Because that implies that I'm homely and that they wouldn't go out with me.  Maybe there's...  But no, you're the monster.  You're like...  You're like...  And they're screaming and they're trying to get out of the studio.  I don't want to scare the girls.  And then you grab a leg, but they get loose.  But there's shoes left behind and they're screaming.  And you're like...  That's Cinderella. 
[03:23:30]  What?  That's Cinderella.  Yeah.  Shawna, are you single, though?  I know you're married.  Oh, boy.  Here's what that means.  That little hesitation.  Let me translate from Scottish to English.  Yes, I'm single.  And you don't have a shot.  And you don't have a shot.  And you don't have a shot.  She went, ah.  She's like, how do I let the little chinless fella down easy?  Ah, yes and absolutely not.  All right.  We have to get Mark Burnett in here.  We'd rather hang out with the hot ladies.  Girls.  Do you want to just bring Mark Burnett in, too? 
[03:24:00]  Why not?  You guys watch Survivor and all that?  Yeah.  He's Australian.  He's everything.  He is pretty much...  He pretty much invented reality TV as we know it.  Some people say, oh, Topps was on the TV before Survivor.  Shut up.  Mark Burnett.  It's been a while.  How you doing, Mark?  Where's the naked ladies?  No.  No.  They're all naked.  They're both from...  They're actresses from the movie Descent.  Mark Burnett was on our show years ago.  We brought in big-breasted women.  Really?  During the interview.  I forgot about that.  The word big underestimates. 
[03:24:30]  I mean, they're like a mountain on each side of their chest.  Yeah, it was...  I ran away.  I have to admit, I ran away.  Yeah, they had awful implants that were actually inflatable.  Yeah.  From a valve.  It was horrid.  Rhiannon.  Her name is real.  No, she was able to make them bigger.  Oh, please don't.  And there was smaller.  There was a valve.  A valve.  A valve.  Under her arm.  Yeah, Rhiannon.  And she tried to hug me, and it was so uncomfortable.  I ran away.  Yeah.  I'm a pretty brave guy normally, but it was so...  It was so massive.  I was going to get in billets and suffocated. 
[03:25:00]  Do men find that attractive?  No.  No.  Absolutely not.  I'm so proud.  You know what the worst part was?  She was so stretched...  Like, there's so much skin that had to be stretched out that you could really see her breast bone  right in between.  It looked like it was a split.  And then on the side of her breasts, you could see where her armpits had actually moved to  the side of her breast.  So she had a shave where you saw razor stubble.  No.  Her armpits used to be under her arms, but now they were on the side of her breast.  It was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. 
[03:25:30]  It was hilarious.  Ever, ever, ever.  It was really...  Horrid.  Pete and Anthony under the big top.  Yeah.  Freak show.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Children of all ages.  A little cane.  Tap it.  You get a nickel.  Go in and see the freak show.  So, Mark, are you Aussie?  I just thought I'd just take over.  Yeah.  I actually am from Mile End in London.  Oh, okay.  I used to live there.  Yeah?  Me too.  That's why I moved away.  I didn't.  No, you got to watch out.  I thought you were from London.  Watch out for her.  She could hang.  Mile End's hard, man. 
[03:26:00]  It is.  Yeah, sure.  That's where I grew up.  East End.  Is it tough?  There's no Aussie.  It's tough.  There's tough places to it.  It's also lovely, though, isn't it?  And my parents are both from Glasgow.  I think...  Oh, God.  I'm working there right this minute.  I'm just trying to...  Look at them talking about other places in the world besides America.  We don't know any...  We Americans, we don't know any...  The rest of the world doesn't exist.  Yeah, let's get this back home.  You ever been to Connecticut?  We're just like, eh. 
[03:26:30]  Everything's here.  We're all self-centered here.  You know, world matters.  It's like, who cares?  Hey, were you hanging out with Tommy Lee and Dave Navarro last night?  Absolutely, all night.  Yeah?  Until the red eye.  Yeah, it's kind of funny because they've both got their little situations this week going on.  Well, yeah.  Tommy's ex married Kid Rock and Dave Navarro's getting a divorce.  I know.  So you've got the two tattooed rockers seeing it.  Yeah.  Having their little private conversations.  Right.  You were behind Rockstar, too, right?  Yes, my show. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  I loved the NXS one a lot.  It was great.  That was great fun.  Great numbers.  And now...  I didn't...  At first, I'm like, what is this horse shit?  I'm not going to lie to you.  And then I started taking a peek.  I'm like, whoa, this is really interesting.  And they picked the perfect guy, and they're now just huge again.  Yeah, touring the world.  And now, my new band with them is Supernova, which is Tommy Lee on drums from Motley Crue.  We've got Gilby Clark from Guns N' Roses.  He's a great guy.  Jason Newstedt on bass from Metallica.  And they're going to find a singer.  And we're going on tour starting in January. 
[03:27:30]  Wow.  Got to find a singer for that one?  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  If you haven't seen the show yet, you should check it out.  The talent is unbelievable.  I think I'll audition for that one.  And?  Yeah, you should.  You know, you have the right kind of...  I do a little karaoke every so long.  No, you can sing.  Mark, he can sing.  Yeah.  But can he drink Jägermeister with Tommy?  Well, that got me in trouble a couple of times on the show, drinking Jägermeister, as you say.  I didn't think that J was pronounced, but...  It's the English accent.  Mark, we used to have a Jägermeister machine in the studio. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, frozen.  Frozen shots.  Really?  And we brought it over here, Tech 7.  Then there may or may not have been a little issue.  Then there was a situation.  Then there was a situation that could have maybe involved something where a girl might have been doing something in a room.  Yeah, naked.  Who knew how old she was.  I may have taken one into the back room while she was in a blackout, and then the EMS showed up.  Well, you know, if you'd ask Tommy Lee on this show, you'd better get that machine back in here.  Yeah, it's been banned from the studio. 
[03:28:30]  We're not allowed to have Jägermeister.  Jägermeister has been banned from the show.  It has been pulled from our schedule.  If you guys ever do a remote in Los Angeles, do it from Tommy Lee's dressing room.  He has the hugest Jägermeister.  Oh, I thought you were going to reference his movie.  Talk about his huge...  Well, back to that again.  It was like, yeah, here we go.  Yeah, it comes around to that again.  Did you see the Tommy Lee sex tape?  No, I didn't see it.  Now you hear about it, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, everyone's heard about it. 
[03:29:00]  Very impressive.  Does that impress you girls, talking about that?  Would it impress me?  What do you mean?  You know, having a big hog.  Hog.  What does hog mean?  It's the same thing.  Well, you guys are asking about the girls with the huge implants, so it's only fair to  you like a big hog.  Do you think girls want little ones?  Let's hope so.  There's so many words for it here.  All of a sudden, I'm not getting noticed that the scent girls have to leave.  Oh, no.  Are they telling us you've got to go?  Big, small, cut, uncut? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  What's the deal?  Cut, uncut?  What does that mean?  Ant-eater.  Circumcised.  Ant-eater.  Or, you know.  Ant-eater.  Or army helmet.  Oh, God.  Army helmet.  I think boobie.  You know boobie.  Well, does it matter to you?  That's a Glaswegian thing.  Does it matter to you?  Tube sock?  No, you know, no one likes it hanging down to the knees, but, you know, it doesn't really  matter.  Does it matter to you?  Yeah, does it matter to you?  Yeah.  I actually resent the fact that I'm circumcised. 
[03:30:00]  It bugs me.  Why?  I don't know.  Why would they do that?  Little baby penis.  Leave it alone.  You want it to...  You want it more?  Is it not more sensitive?  You want it a sweater?  See, it is.  It's more sensitive.  You don't have to worry.  If you are circumcised, when it's just in your pants, that might be a problem sometimes?  Because the head...  I mean, the head rubs against your underpants.  You're exposed.  Yeah.  It would have to be a very weird situation where that would happen.  Yeah.  So, obviously, you're circumcised.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It would have to be really weird. 
[03:30:30]  Jimmy has a problem with premature ejaculation.  I do.  He didn't want to tell you.  It normally happens during a handshake.  What if I say, can I have your number?  And they say, yes.  Apologies.  It never happens to me.  Yeah, it's a bad thing that he has to deal with in his life.  A lot of the European women are not surprised by that, whereas a lot of American women think  it's kind of gross to be...  Mark Burnett's like...  Unclipped.  It's like, what the hell are we talking about?  You know Sabbath?  Yeah, no, European...  Of course, that question comes out. 
[03:31:00]  All right, listen.  Let's...  Ladies, thank you.  I've learned something new today.  Thank you.  Did you what?  Hog?  That too, yeah.  What did you learn?  I thought it was more unusual to be circumcised, but apparently...  American women think the other.  It's the opposite.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Interesting.  And I like being the way I am.  Welcome.  Welcome to America.  Thank you.  Welcome.  Glad we can educate you.  Thank you.  We're so cultured.  What a bunch of drets we are.  We've got to give the big plug, because obviously...  We do have to go.  Sean and Natalie both were very cool to hang with this chaotic show.  We do appreciate it. 
[03:31:30]  Absolutely, ladies.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  The Descent starts on...  Was it Friday?  Friday, yeah.  And I guess it's starting all over the country, and it's supposed to be like a really good  horror film, because I talked to somebody else who downloaded it illegally, which is  not recommended.  But I heard it was a good film, so...  What an ass.  I'm telling you.  That's what everybody told me.  Number one.  Number one at the box office you watch Friday.  Thank you, boys.  Absolutely.  Good luck.  See you.  Have a good one.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, girls.  I'm going to go get my picture taken with my tuna.  Are you?  I certainly am.  Yeah, because they're going to be big stars.  Absolutely.  Well, you're a big star, right?  What an insult.  Another insult. 
[03:32:00]  A little bit.  They're both very beautiful girls.  Thank you, ladies.  Thanks for being a good sport.  Bye, ladies.  There they go as we watch them.  We get to watch them walk out.  See their legs and stuff.  What do you think, Mark?  They're pretty.  Nice, right?  You know...  Yes, Mark.  They're nice.  I feel like I've just gone back 20 years to living in London and Glasgow.  Yeah.  We just want to keep you real.  When you visit our show, we want to bring it down.  We've got to ground you a little bit.  We have to ground you a little bit.  You can never, ever crown me like the last time I came here. 
[03:32:30]  That's true.  I was speechless for about half an hour.  That's our whole goal.  Wasn't that awful?  You know what I mean?  That was awful.  It was hard.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I do apologize.  I just got my picture with both of them.  Yeah.  They smell so good.  I know.  When they walked in, you could smell them.  God, are they great.  It's so nice that they get out of this locker room fucking atmosphere for a second.  All right.  So let's get into it.  Nice.  Yeah.  How do you know Sabbath?  Like, you know, all the boys, these are Bill Tony has.  He's a huge Black Sabbath fan.  No, I don't know them that well. 
[03:33:00]  I've just met them.  But it's because of what I do for a living now.  I mean, I've met a lot of people through Tommy and Gilby and Jason.  They're friends coming by the show.  And somehow I got myself in the rock business.  This is going to be a lot bigger this year because In Excess did really well and they're touring the world.  But, you know, Tommy Lee, who you're going to actually see tomorrow night, Tuesday night on CBS, he actually plays on the show.  And the guy's a legend.  Yeah.  He plays with the rockers.  And they're going to be on tour in January. 
[03:33:30]  New singer.  You know, it's kind of cool as opposed to the In Excess.  Truth of the matter is, everyone knew Michael Hudgens as a front man and very recognizable.  This time around, you know all the other guys.  You, like, know who they are.  Yeah.  And for some people last year, it was a bit weird because Hudgens was so loved and died in an awful way.  Yeah.  And stepping into Dead Men's Shoes.  Yeah.  It happened.  JD did it.  And now they're touring and making it work.  People thought it was a little morbid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, this one is just, hey, we're looking to find a singer for this rock band. 
[03:34:00]  It's interesting enough, these singers who are trying out are really, really good.  Dave Navarro keeps telling them all the time, you know, you don't want to be the singer.  The people are peering around behind you to see your drummer.  You've got to be big enough as a lead singer that you command the stage and you're not in the way of Tommy Lee.  Imagine being the singer.  Yeah, sure.  Everybody's going to want to see the famous guy, Tommy Lee.  Yeah, you've got to blow him away with your voice and stage presence.  Well, don't drummers have like a weird complex?  Like, I know Metallica, when they tour now, they have like one guy in every corner. 
[03:34:30]  It's almost like Lars probably got sick of being behind.  So don't they have like that weird whole like hating me behind the band thing, drummers?  Yeah.  And or your Tommy, where you're such a big show going on that the audience has focused on you,  which is what I'm saying.  So to be the lead singer of Supernova, you better only be a good singer and a front person.  You better be larger than life so Tommy doesn't overshadow you on every song.  It's hard for a drummer to get out of that whole thing.  Only a few really have because most of the time it's that old joke, what do you call the  guy that hangs out with a band? 
[03:35:00]  The drummer.  But yeah, Tommy Lee became bigger than life and stuff and I think a lot of that was his  lifestyle.  He used to hover over the audience and stuff.  Yeah, the things they used to do with Motley Crue where, all right, we'll put him up in  the air and spin him around a few times.  Neil Peart.  Yeah.  He's another one you wouldn't know.  Rick Allen.  Have you read that book, The Dirt?  Have you read that book?  Oh, yeah.  Unbelievable what they used to do.  I'm surprised it isn't a movie yet.  I've heard things that were going to make it into a movie.  Insanity.  The sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  One of the best rock books I've ever read. 
[03:35:30]  Incredible.  Right up there with the doors.  On 11.  No one here comes out.  Gets out alive.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gets out of here alive.  Hey, were you supposed to do Rockstar with Van Halen?  No, no.  A lot of ideas are thrown around by managers and record labels.  The Queen was thrown up as an idea.  Steve C.  Look at Paul Rogers.  Yeah.  The truth is for us, I felt going in a new direction.  And Tommy Lee and I both spent a lot of time in Malibu. 
[03:36:00]  You know, we both live in Malibu.  And I know Tommy.  His kids know my kids.  And Tommy said he was going to do another project and just some ideas.  I said, why don't you use our show to find your singers?  That's awesome.  It was a much fresher idea.  And we got great talent this year.  Because last year, I think, the talent was good, but people were skeptical.  Real rockers were skeptical of selling out on TV.  When they saw that it worked out, this year we got much, much better talent.  I'm imagining your phone's ringing off the hook now.  Yeah, so it's great talent.  You live in Malibu?  Yeah.  You know Mel? 
[03:36:30]  I've run into Mel.  You've run into him?  You shouldn't use run into today.  Yeah, well, you run into him a couple of times?  Yeah.  In the stores and stuff.  He's not buying matzas, right?  And their family do a lot charitably with the schools.  Yeah, yeah.  His wife is a huge advocate for the kids in the schools.  And so, yeah, they're public schools there and they're underfunded.  So, obviously, all the locals put money into the public schools.  Did you read the transcripts of what happened? 
[03:37:00]  What transcripts?  What's a lot of the police like in Malibu?  What are they like?  Nice guys?  The police in Malibu are nice guys, but not to be messed with.  You don't want to drive drunk.  Like, they probably take care of the town because it's very exclusive and they don't  want, you know, riffraff in there.  I'm surprised they kind of even went as far as they did with Mel.  You would think it would be, hey, Mel, we'll drive you home.  You know?  Maybe they would have if he wasn't such an obnoxious dick immediately.  Well, the reports are, allegedly, he was being a little belligerent.  Yeah.  And a little... 
[03:37:30]  You ever see him tip a few back?  But don't you think the cops...  Don't you think the cops want the big score, though?  No, because that's not like...  Who said that they should have just drove him home?  I'm thinking the cops ain't...  Not with celebrities, especially in Malibu.  You don't want to get on the bad side of these guys.  Then again, didn't they bust Nicholson for...  Well, no, he had an incident with another motorist he had to us.  Oh, well, yeah, with the golf club, so...  And he had the smack in the face.  What's her name there?  Zsa Zsa, was it?  Yeah, or I remember she slapped her in the face.  Hey, Mark, how many more years for Survivor?  You know... 
[03:38:00]  I jumped back on board, by the way.  Oh, you did?  I went away for a few seasons.  But then this past one, I jumped back on board, and I loved the new twists and stuff you  guys went with.  I only got back...  I was out there shooting Survivor, got back 48 hours ago.  It's pretty epic.  We're in Cook Islands, a great theme this year.  And, you know, the last one was back up to the big ratings again.  Yeah.  And so I think we're going to grow this year.  So that's season 13.  13?  Season 13?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Well, they're doing two a year, pretty much, right?  Yeah, so it's been on to seven years. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, wow.  I was going to say, 13 years?  Wait a minute.  13, because it's double.  And we're about to shoot 14 in Fiji.  So I could see it going through 16, 18.  Right.  I mean, the fact of the matter is, it's the only reality show...  It was two...  American Idol and Survivor.  Right.  The originals that people stay with.  And kids love Survivor.  Well, you got smart, though, I got to tell you.  Because when Survivor first hit it, there was nothing like that on TV at all.  And you guys had the run of the place. 
[03:39:00]  And then reality shows, as we know, are what they are.  And it made Survivor, for a few seasons there, look a little dated and old.  And then you were smart enough to really, you know, up your game and come up with some different twists and turns with, like, Exile Island and all that in the last one.  And you're back on top again.  I mean, in this next one, which you haven't seen yet, which we're filming now, Exile Island is back in and plays a huge role.  You know, Exile Island means the team that loses the reward challenge not only didn't get the food, the winning team can send one of them over to Exile Island. 
[03:39:30]  And there's nothing there.  So when you're on Exile Island, you're literally starving for two or three days.  But the only benefit of there is hidden over there is a hidden immunity idol.  And you've got to get these clues and look for the immunity idols while starving.  But you come back to play.  Starving.  Literally, it's awful.  You come back to play a challenge right from it.  So you're now undernourished, underhydrated, tired, pissed off, and maybe didn't find the idol. 
[03:40:00]  And you don't tell anyone if you found the idol, because then later in the game you can use it when you really need it.  Oh, wow.  I'm telling you, he'd get out of jail free card.  Whoever did that, they saved the show because, you know, you were starting to head down that road.  Are you flattered by all the reality shows that are out there?  Because, I mean, you know, we said earlier this morning that you pretty much invented reality TV.  And someone's like, oh, cops, man, cops.  But as far as what it is today, it all goes right back to Mark Burnett. 
[03:40:30]  Are you flattered by all the other shows or are you frustrated or what?  No.  You know, I moved to America from England 20 years ago because this country is that competition.  And that's what makes things work.  That's why your show is so good on the radio.  Thank you, sir.  You've got to be because you're up against other shows.  Right.  And if you're not innovative, you know, it's what the free market economy does.  So the way I look at other reality shows is, hey, it makes us all work harder.  I mean, I'm really proud of my show.  You look, I've got Survivor.  I love it. 
[03:41:00]  The Apprentice.  Trump's great.  Contender.  You've seen my boxing show.  That's right.  It's great.  It's on ESPN right now.  I've got to get into that one, too.  But you've got to watch that on ESPN right now.  It's really brilliant.  And Rockstar.  Rockstar has got a really rabid audience.  And it's such different TV.  And I'm trying to do different things.  You're part of Gold Rush, too?  Yeah, Gold Rush is my new thing, which we're launching September 13th.  It looks pretty interesting.  You think, what I was thinking, you know, TV ratings in general are a bit down.  But you look at how many people in their offices from 9 to 5 in daytime are online broadband. 
[03:41:30]  You remember 10 years ago, making a personal phone call at work was like, you're whispering,  hey, I love you.  I've got to go to the boss's corner.  Right.  Now, go around any office block, everybody's I.M.ing.  All day long.  Or check in the sports.  Yeah, you're talking to each other all the time.  The weather.  Everyone's doing it.  So what was replaced by you can't make personal phone calls, you're actually online.  My mission was, okay, how can I provide reality programming in small soundbite pieces at work? 
[03:42:00]  Couldn't 9 to 5 be the new prime time?  Aren't more people online with broadband 9 to 5 than ever watched TV at night?  So Gold Rush is I've created a treasure hunt where the clues are in three-minute segments.  Mark Steinus, the guy from Entertainment Tonight, is the host of it.  And the way you find the gold is through pop culture knowledge.  Like, will it involve you guys?  You guys could just have fun with it and have guests on. 
[03:42:30]  And, for example, the Mel Gibson thing could have been a clue this week.  And the answer was DUI.  Right.  So you can come up with the intelligent stuff when it first breaks.  And you go to AOL, type in the clues, opens the vault, and you learn where the gold is.  When are you going to throw us a ball?  How about a reality show about a guy that went to Rio and didn't use condoms and called out the real survivor?  When are you going to throw us a ball, Mark?  Come on.  We're feeling it.  We're feeling the energy here.  There's a chemistry.  Gold Rush.  Gold Rush? 
[03:43:00]  Get us involved with Gold Rush.  We'll help you out.  And I'll help you because AOL will send millions of people who will need to hear the show.  Because even in the cities where you can't actually get the show now, you can always go online, right?  Right.  And get the show.  Oh, absolutely.  It's fair for everybody.  Yeah.  So we'll involve you, for sure.  You guys are always fun.  Yeah, we are.  And, you know, I learned about Mark Burnett because of Eco Challenge.  That was your first real show in America, was Eco Challenge. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, I did it on Discourage Hell, then USA Network.  Are you still doing those?  No, I stopped it.  It was so dangerous.  But is it still going on?  Are you so dangerous?  No.  We've talked about Eco Challenge on the show.  It was crazy.  It was really an amazing race.  Eco Challenge and a bit of Survivor and made their version of Running Around Cities.  Eco Challenge was really going to, like, the Sahara Desert or the Alps and these places  or the Amazon Jungle and going through, with no supervision, 500 miles and see who makes it. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  And I was lucky, honestly.  I did nine seasons of that, nine years, and no one died.  And I was really lucky.  It was a crazy undertaking.  Really lucky.  They're scaling mountains in the snow and going down the other side and then going in the rapids.  It's kind of amazed me over the course of the years with reality television is that there  hasn't been one of these just tragic deaths where, you know, it kind of somebody sues.  It's now all kinds of new rules come into play. 
[03:44:30]  And, you know, I'm sure that's thought about in your business.  And hence, I'm no longer doing Eco Challenge.  Right, right.  So you got smart.  When I first did it, I didn't have anything to lose.  And now I've been pretty successful in television.  The last thing I need to do is put a show on the air where it's likely someone's going to get hurt.  Likely.  Someone's going to get killed.  Because that'll be what the Janet Jackson thing was to the FCC and indecency. 
[03:45:00]  I think a death will be to reality programming.  You know, that could really make people step back and go, okay, that's it.  We've got to regulate this and, you know, get this off the air.  What do you see for reality?  Killjoy's reality program.  Is it going to continue developing or are we going to get bored and want to go back to the boring sitcoms?  No, I don't think so.  I think the truth is when Survivor came on, remember the first season?  It was about 2000.  There were 72 million people in summer watched our finale. 
[03:45:30]  It was the most watched program since Sonny and Cher in 1973, to give you this perspective.  Same type of ratings like a Super Bowl game.  Wow.  That got ratings back in 73?  Yeah.  Well, there was two channels.  Yeah, I was going to say.  So after that, there were like 50 copycat shows that came on.  And a lot of them rushed on there and pretty crap.  And it made it look bad.  So I said then, reality TV will be held to the same high standard as great comedies and great dramas. 
[03:46:00]  It's going to have to work and let the cream rise to the top.  And what has happened is true.  What I said, now a healthy network has some dramas, some comedies, and some good reality.  And that's what works.  Crappy stuff won't make it whether it's a bad drama, a bad comedy, or bad reality.  You know, you're being given a gift of primetime television, like you get given a gift of radio.  You guys have to perform.  If it's not good, people aren't listening.  Yeah, we're going to start doing that at some point. 
[03:46:30]  We know we have to, but putting it off as long as possible.  Reality is here to stay as long as it's good.  It's not going to take over.  It's going to be a part of a larger schedule.  A lot of people fading to the internet, though.  Yeah, hence Gold Rush.  I mean, that's why I'm doing it.  I still watch TV, but I have my laptop on the whole time, checking out all the stuff, YouTube and everything else.  I always get the TV turned straight away while I'm in front of the computer.  Because I think it's kind of out of habit.  You want that as kind of background noise, but more of my attention is on the computer now. 
[03:47:00]  What you're saying is so true, and that's why.  Because it's like, we talk about this on our show.  It's like the Wild Wild West computer still.  You know, the crap that TV makes you do because, ah, this might offend somebody.  You can't do this.  You can still get away with a lot more on the internet.  It's gotten more convenient.  I mean, back, you know, when you used to have to, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, with the AOL.  And you'd sit there and try to, you know, get online and dial up.  And now, you know, everyone's wireless around their house, so you're just plopping a laptop down. 
[03:47:30]  It's not like laptops aren't like desktops now.  They are.  They're just as powerful.  So you can sit there and do whatever you want on the computer.  So it's constantly on.  And the key that I've learned through creating Gold Rush was small three-minute segments.  And I think someone wants to sit there and watch an hour or even watch half an hour.  That's all.  So if it moves fast, like, I'm giving clues of where to find this gold on Gold Rush on AOL.com. 
[03:48:00]  And if the clues are interesting and the three-minute sound bites and you start to figure out where it is and you're moving up in the game.  And also, you don't have to play at any certain time or any certain day.  You know, the clues are over a week.  You want to find that gold and really go and get it.  You can play it all one day, a little bit per day.  It's on your schedule, which really is the important thing, right?  You don't want, these days in television, very few people want to work on the network's schedule.  Yeah, on demand and DVRs.  On demand, DVRs, things like that. 
[03:48:30]  How much is the Gold Rush, I'm sorry, how much is the Gold Rush prize?  It all starts on the 13th of September when there are 13 trucks leaving a secret facility full of gold.  The first 12 trucks have $100,000 in solid gold in the trunk, and the 13th is $1,000,000 in solid gold in the trunk.  The trucks head out, under the cover of darkness, and Mark Steinus, who's hosting it, turns to the camera and says,  by the morning, all that gold is hidden somewhere in the continental United States. 
[03:49:00]  Anyone can play this reality game.  It's not like a TV show.  You just go to AOL.com, answer pop culture questions.  The key opens the vault, and you could be the person who collects that gold.  So it's actually allowing everybody to play.  But where are the answers to the clues?  On OPN in the show, on Entertainment Tonight, on CSI, in EW, People Magazine.  You're just living life.  So in other words, what I decided, what is it that we do all the time? 
[03:49:30]  We're all around reading trashy magazines.  We're watching network TV.  Lucky Louie.  Radio shows, scores, and in that stuff around pop culture, hide the clues.  Great idea, man.  Give me an example.  Here's an example.  Okay, let's say the clue was about a Kabbalah chick whose name is Esther.  Madonna.  Okay, Madonna. 
[03:50:00]  Right.  Then another clue was the city where CSI takes place.  Uh-oh.  A Kabbalah.  Miami?  No.  Albany?  Lebanon.  New York.  Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Mantown.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Of course.  So there you've got Madonna and Las Vegas.  Then you go to Madonna's album.  The album's called Ray of Light.  Where are we looking now for the gold?  Ray of Light, Las Vegas.  Ray of Light. 
[03:50:30]  In the Pyramid Hotel.  Correct.  Luxor.  Luxor.  So we're in the Luxor Hotel.  Well, Madonna's title track on the album runs 5 minutes 21 seconds.  Wow.  It's in room 521 of the Luxor.  See, let's say you try it.  You stay out of room 521, Doc.  I'm not supposed to.  Had to do a shiny one.  Of course.  Go ahead.  So room 521 of the Luxor.  That's an example of you can use those sort of things.  It's just intelligent writing that takes pop culture stuff, whether it's music, films.  Is it possible you're going to get 1,000 people that have the key, and then you're 
[03:51:00]  going to have to have some kind of runoff?  What it's going to be is we've figured that out.  The first three people online to get through the 10 questions and amass 10 gold bars will  get a phone call from Mark Steiners.  We sent an air ticket over the internet, and we'll get on planes, and those three will show  up at, let's say, the Luxor.  And there's three more sets of questions, and then the final two have 50 keys to that  door, and they have two minutes to open the door. 
[03:51:30]  And if they run out of time, then it's your turn.  And you go back and forth, and one of them is going to open that door.  So it's making a reality show for anybody.  Otherwise, all casting for these shows, anybody can play.  You're over 18.  So you're going to have 10 questions.  Each question you just asked about what's the title track on the album, they're not  going to have to figure that out.  The question's actually going to be, how long is the title track?  No, no, no.  You've got to figure this stuff out.  Oh, you do have to figure it out.  You've got to be like a detective.  How many questions will you get per subject to have to...  About 10 questions per cache of gold. 
[03:52:00]  Okay.  Yeah, and for example, as I led you through, I mean, I'll give you another example on that  one, Las Vegas.  You would say, the bird that lives in the Ituri forest.  So you'd look online, everything online.  So you find out that Ituri forest only exists in the San Diego Zoo.  And the San Diego Zoo, the bird that's there is the ibis.  The ibis is an Egyptian bird.  So you think in Egyptian, Las Vegas, that's where you're getting down to the pyramid, that's 
[03:52:30]  Luxor.  Then it says, the next one is, the next clue is 258 miles if the ibis could fly.  Okay, what is exactly 258 miles from San Diego Zoo?  Oh, okay.  Las Vegas.  It's a bunny ranch.  It's a bunny ranch.  And then you've got Madonna's Tile Trek, Ray of Light.  The only place that's Egyptian stuff in Vegas with a ray of light is Luxor Hotel.  So it doesn't take you to be a genius, but you've got no pop culture.  You've got to be smart.  Right on, man. 
[03:53:00]  That's great, man.  What a brilliant, brilliant thing to go online like that.  Dude, you're always at the forefront of things.  Involve everybody.  And I just want to somehow coattail it and make money.  And Mark, we do dick jokes.  Yeah, that's what we do.  Great, isn't it?  And thank God for XM, huh?  Could you give us some advice?  Because all we do is dick jokes, and we fart into the mic.  Well, I think you should have Tommy Lee on.  We've had him on it.  Opie ruined that relationship.  There was a little problem.  I'd have to blame Tommy, not Opie. 
[03:53:30]  Thank you, Jimmy.  No, I've got to sign it up on that one.  Opie called him a pussy.  And then Tommy said, you call me a pussy one more time, and I'm hanging up.  And Opie went, all right, pussy, click.  And he hung up, so there's been a problem.  What happened was this.  Shall I fix it?  Yeah, please do.  It was right after Pam Anderson went on Larry King.  Oh, right.  It was the day after.  So he was on, and no one confronted him.  It was just an honest question, almost like, what about this?  And then you could kind of explain your side of the story. 
[03:54:00]  And he got really pissed off.  He was like, come on, guys.  This is old news.  I'm like, what happened to Larry King last night?  He said he didn't want to talk about us.  The sad part is, Ant and I had a good relationship for many, many years.  Many years.  We've probably talked to him, who knows, half a dozen times.  Make you a deal, honestly.  Either TVL or watch it.  Watch Rockstar tomorrow night, Tuesday night, CBS.  Okay.  And I'll call you on Wednesday.  All right.  And I'll patch things up.  All right.  Sounds like a deal.  Fair deal. 
[03:54:30]  Fair deal.  I like that deal.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because we do like Tommy Lee.  Definitely.  And we can talk about the show and patch things up.  And then we can ask him how he feels then.  Kid Rock just married Pam.  We weren't asking that.  Maybe you should wait a week or two because it's too fresh right now.  Hold on, Mark.  I can't help myself.  I don't know what to tell you.  But meanwhile, you know, Tommy's a grown-up.  Yeah.  And as you know, he's a crazy rocker, but he's a sweetheart.  You know that as a guy.  Tommy's such a sweetheart.  And you know what?  You watch the show. 
[03:55:00]  I'm going to call you Wednesday.  I'm going to call this studio Wednesday.  Okay.  And I'm going to hook you up with Tommy.  That'd be cool.  Definitely.  Mark Burnett.  Thanks, Mark.  Thank you so much.  So we're promoting Gold Rush and obviously Rockstar.  Thank you.  And Survivor.  You don't have to promote that anymore.  And Gold Rush will promote you.  All right.  Because honestly, if you've got to come here for the clues.  Really fast because I'm kind of confused.  And then Gold Rush is going to be on TV as well?  No.  So the whole game is on AOL.  Brilliant.  See, I thought you were using the internet, but kind of like Big Brother,  you're kind of trying to do.  In fact, we reversed it.  If you think the TV element to Gold Rush is that the answers to the clues are hidden 
[03:55:30]  within CSI, within Survivor, without a trace, within opening Anthony.  So shows that exist for their own purposes, there's clues hidden within those shows,  which make listeners and viewers.  Yeah.  Get us involved in Gold Rush.  It's also fun.  That's really cool.  No, I had no idea there wasn't a TV element.  I knew you guys would be interested because you guys were always doing innovative stuff.  You know, always at the forefront.  We try.  People like Dave Kevin and his interviews, of course. 
[03:56:00]  Very innovative.  And now we're actually going to bring in a fan.  So when we fart, the fart sound is a little different.  You're making us look very bad.  We'll talk about it on Free FM as well.  So you get a bigger audience there.  Oh, wow.  XM, meaning that there's double the audience.  Right.  We start in Chicago and San Francisco tomorrow, Mark.  Well.  Yeah.  Hey.  All you need is Dave Navarro and Tommy Lee on the XM version.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then cut that down for the Free FM.  Right.  Mark Burnett, it's always a pleasure. 
[03:56:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Could you come and hang out with us a little more often?  No.  But it's been like five years.  The guy's busy.  We didn't even bring in the girls this time because we wanted to finally talk to you.  He was horrified last night.  I know.  So was I.  Guys, you know, I've been around the block.  I was horrified.  Yeah.  But so were you.  Yeah.  Ugh.  You know what?  I don't want them anywhere near me.  Mark Burnett, Opie, and they all totally horrified.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that girl tried to hug me and I ran away.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  All right.  We know you have another interview. 
[03:57:00]  You got a very important guy out there with a briefcase.  I don't know what that means.  It's another reality show we don't know about.  It's money in there.  Right.  It's the solid goals.  Are we supposed to tackle?  Solid goals.  It's the goal for gold run.  Right.  All right.  Mark Burnett, everybody.  Thank you, Mark.  Thank you, Mark.  Thanks.  All right.  Thanks, man.  There he goes.  I'm going to go out and get a picture.  Go out and get a picture.  I'm going to throw a show idea at Mark real quick.  Oh, do that.  Pitch a show.  How many times has that happened?  That's original.  Yeah.  I know, right?  I got this idea.  Shut up.  I got an idea.  Shock jock.  A shock jock. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's not shocking.  All right.  What?  Well.  All right.  That was fun.  That should hold the bastards for a while.  Trish, Indiana, what's up?  Oh, well, I had a question for Mr. Burnett, but I guess I can't answer it.  No.  He's gone.  I know.  That's all right.  Well, thank you, anyways, guys, for the awesome show.  I'm loving it, as always.  You're very, very welcome, Trish.  All right.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:58:00]  Well, anyways.  Keep enjoying.  Trish.  Yeah.  What did you like about the show today?  Oh, my God.  God damn it.  They always fall for it, and it's always funny.  But it's the only thing I do on the show.  Oh, look at what Opie and Anthony continue to spread as pests, pester Whoopi.  The pests got a headline today.  The pests getting in the headline. 
[03:58:30]  O&A pests get a headline today.  How great is this?  Congratulations.  Wake up with Whoopi made its day, but today.  Anthony, the tea is silent.  Ah, not really.  I think it's kind of a soft tea.  Debut.  Debut.  Debut.  Debut.  Debut.  Debut.  It's debut today on WKTU New York before launching nationally on August 14th.  So pests, on August 14th, you'll be national. 
[03:59:00]  Keep it going.  We love it.  Did one of the program, what, day one, did one.  Day one of the program found the celebrity-turned-DJ getting an introduction to the prank calls from the competition.  At least three different calls from the pests of XM Satellite Radio's Opie and Anthony program made their way on the air, dropping references to the duo's program in the process.  Upon finding out the callers were from the O&A program, Whoopi said, quote, there are other folks out there. 
[03:59:30]  Some of them are good.  Some of them are not.  We are no threat to anybody.  We're just doing a show that we want.  We just doing a show.  We just doing a show that we want to be doing.  That's why I corrected him.  Howard understands that.  Stern, of course.  That's my friend.  That's my friend.  Howie's not your friend.  So she's trying to, she's instantly right there trying to make some connection where she thinks she's going to pick up.  Boy, that's going to scare us.  Yeah, boy, they'll all go. 
[04:00:00]  You're obviously Howie's friend.  Back to you.  I'm sure Howie's told you the stories, right?  These other people, they're not worth the dust Howard walks on.  By the way, that's gold dust he walks on.  It was part of his serious contract.  No?  Okay.  Lots of money.  Oh, dear Lord, I just felt.  We don't even see a lot of gold dust.  True, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I mean, where do you see gold dust?  After another pass, there's gold dust.  It's not so same.  I think back in the old west during the old panning for gold days. 
[04:00:30]  But this gold is solid.  Don't pulverize gold.  It could be dusty if you're cutting it up.  But that's not even an expression in anything.  All right, you win.  I suck.  The roads are paved with gold dust.  Are they?  Why did you have to take away my moment?  Dude, your moment's fantastic.  I wanted to help you.  Oh, I thank you for that, by the way.  I'll kiss you square in the mouth.  True.  Gold dust.  These other people, not worth the dust Howard walks on.  Another pest made it through.  Whoopi warned, know that we're going to scream better. 
[04:01:00]  Know that we're going to scream better.  Yeah.  So he's on top of the situation.  But there you go, pest.  Congratulations.  FMQB.com has the headline.  Yes, Big Kev.  Nothing?  I didn't say anything.  No, you got a headset on and everything.  I'm just listening.  Sorry.  And then they talk about our Chicago and San Francisco thing.  So that's cool.  WCKG starting tomorrow.  Getting some nice headlines today.  Yeah, Chicago. 
[04:01:30]  So, all right.  How was Disturbed?  Very political.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Wait, I was supposed to get something signed by the whole band.  So I wanted to know what they got me signed.  The manifesto.  We'll tear down a wall today.  Did they get me something signed?  The wall's coming down.  We like Disturbed.  Watch it.  Jimmy, we like Disturbed.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We do like them a lot.  Is he Israeli or no, he's just Jewish?  Oh, he's Israeli.  Oh, he's Israeli.  Hardcore Israeli.  Because that's what Enemy is about, I think, is the whole situation.  We were having a pretty fun show. 
[04:02:00]  Okay.  A lot of laughs.  And he took the laughs right out of the show.  Okay.  It got a little serious.  A lot of Hezbollah and Lebanon.  Which is fine, Jimmy.  We just had a different rhythm going on that day.  And we wish maybe...  At that moment.  Okay.  We just wish maybe it was another day or something.  Because we were really rolling on some funny stuff.  He's like a serious dude is what it is.  Huh?  He's a serious dude.  I even...  At one point I go... 
[04:02:30]  Like any time you've talked to him.  At one point I go, do you find anything funny?  Because I'm like, laugh, smile, do something, please.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm finding you guys funny.  I saw it.  I'm finding you guys funny.  You guys are funny.  I saw his episode of Cribs and he had a really nice house and all his friend and bandmates  were over and they're having fun in the pool and he's just walking around going, well,  I guess it's time to go.  Yeah.  I'm not trashing him.  Trust me.  He gives us good radio.  It's just like the timing was kind of bad.  Well, you can tell by his lyrics, though.  He doesn't fuck around.  I mean, his lyrics are exactly, you know, oh, he's a fucking animal, this guy. 
[04:03:00]  I love him.  Oh, I love his stuff.  I'm so pissed I missed him again.  What's on the show tomorrow?  Oh, we have a board.  A new board.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr's coming in because we're going to be pumping the...  the ONA traveling virus starting tomorrow.  So we got...  Yes.  We got Bill Burr tomorrow, Bob Kelly Wednesday, Patrice O'Neill Thursday.  We got...  And then some of the other guys that are going to do the show with us in Boston this Saturday  at the DCU Center.  We'll also be calling in and checking in and all that.  Thank God it's in that great E-Rock penmanship that we've all grown to love. 
[04:03:30]  That's great.  It's like a child.  People think we're lying to you.  I said exactly what happened, Joe.  It would be neater if someone put a pen in their asshole and tried to write on a thing  than you just did with your hands.  Joe.  I'll grab your dick.  Joe.  Hello?  Go.  Hello.  Yes, Joe.  You're on the air.  You're on the air, Joe.  Oh, hi.  How you guys doing?  All right.  I just want to say, open answer.  You guys should have lied to Jimmy.  That interview with the surf sucked, man.  Put me to sleep.  No one lied.  He's just saying that it was a bit out of the humor and kind of run of the show. 
[04:04:00]  No one lied to you, dude.  I didn't lie to you.  And I'll tell you this much, Joe.  A lot of people enjoyed the interview with Disturbed.  Yeah.  It just wasn't the time for it right then and there when we were.  I'll admit this.  The timing sucked.  Sometimes we're on a roll with the radio show and we get really bummed out because  we have something scheduled.  We're like, oh, can we reschedule?  Then you find out, no, the person flew in just for this interview and you get bummed out  because you're in a flow.  So that's all I'm saying here.  We also got feedback from people that enjoyed his take on the whole war and it was interesting. 
[04:04:30]  But, you know, if I had it over to do again, I would have rescheduled.  Shut the f***.  Go ahead, Joe.  Let's make it the Joe show.  It's the Joe show.  Go ahead, Joe.  I'm done.  Go ahead, Joe.  Go ahead, Joe.  It's so important you can't fucking listen.  It's your show.  Go ahead.  Talk as long as you want.  We're out until 12.  Goodbye.  I'm just saying that one interview sucks.  I'm not saying the whole show sucks.  Let him keep talking.  Let him keep talking. 
[04:05:00]  See you tomorrow.  We're out in Chicago, San Francisco.  It's the Joe show.  Continue, Joe.  Let's see how far he can go.  Yes, Joe.  After 30 seconds, it's going to get a lot tougher.  After 60, you're going to be sweating your balls off.  After two minutes, you're going to wish you were dead.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  He hung up.  Fucking faggot.  All right.  Um, what day is it?  Monday.  Monday? 
[04:05:30]  Monday.  Hey, we'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you, David.  The current it boys of FM Talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony.  And the talk is racy and raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can.  Show your hairy pork chop.  My mother smokes crack rocks.  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay down and give you a little bukkake?  We'll laugh.  We're going to have a disgusting body fluid blowout.  Gay porn.  Hey, could you soap up your bad place?  The sluttier, the better. 
[04:06:00]  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla. </pre>
