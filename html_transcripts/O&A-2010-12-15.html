<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of two news stories: a school board meeting hostage situation culminating in the gunman's suicide, and a $2.5 million Bellagio casino chip heist.  The hosts and callers dissected a video of the school shooting, focusing heavily on a woman's failed attempt to subdue the gunman with her purse, using highly offensive language and repeated replays of the video.  A police officer caller explained the legal criteria for using lethal force. The Bellagio robbery received less attention, with speculation about the thief's escape and the casino's security.  The show interspersed these discussions with promotions for Anthony's Foxwoods poker tournament and a caller's misguided attempt to retell the school shooting story.  A video of a purse-snatching incident in a mall parking lot further fueled the discussion of women's purses.  Patrice O'Neal joined the show in studio towards the end of this segment.

The next segment began with a continued, highly offensive, real-time reaction to the school board shooting video, detailing the gunman's actions (including a "V for Vendetta" wall painting and missed shots) and the woman's (dubbed "Ginger") attempts to intervene.  The hosts heavily criticized Ginger's actions in a CNN interview clip.  The conversation then veered wildly, touching on celebrity comparisons to the gunman, racial stereotypes regarding gun violence, the wealth of celebrities like Lil Wayne, expensive cars (Maybachs and Bugattis), aging and mortality, a hypothetical time-travel amusement park, the movie *Braveheart*, and the firing of a Santa Claus for indecent exposure.  The tone remained irreverent and comedic throughout.

A significant portion of the show focused on aging and unchanging personalities, triggered by an anecdote about Opie's boss, Steve Blatter, reprimanding him for sagging sweatpants.  This led to a lengthy, racially charged discussion about the hosts' and Patrice O'Neal's experiences with people of Asian descent, particularly in service industries, filled with profanity and exaggerated reactions.  The conversation also included another promotion for the Foxwoods poker tournament.

The final segment started with Anthony recounting a $20 tip he gave a bartender at the Apollo Theater and the perceived reaction, leading to a highly charged discussion about race relations, tipping etiquette, and racial stereotypes in service industries.  Patrice O'Neal contributed significantly to this conversation, which involved frequent use of racial slurs and offensive language, and included a brief call from "Dr. X" from Mexico, who quickly hung up.  The discussion also touched on the treatment of strippers and the hostsâ€™ experiences in various service settings. This transitioned into a discussion of Anthony's extensive sneaker collection, followed by a comedic bit proposing a radical restructuring of the United States into larger, combined states, culminating in absurd suggestions. The segment concluded with a Vermont Teddy Bear advertisement.

It's not the winter festival gifts, it's Christmas  It's Christmas, it's not the holiday season  Right, and it should be called Christmas  Because it's about Santa Claus, not Jesus  What about the Christ? 
[00:01:30]  Keep Christ in Christmas  No, man, it stopped being a religious holiday many, many years ago  As far as my life goes  And many people's lives  I know them churches are packed on Christmas  Are they?  Yeah, I think people like still celebrating Christianity  Nah, it's about the Santa Claus  Nah, it's about presents and drinking and hanging out  And we acknowledge the people that give us gifts  And Caroline's, thank you very much  Oh, yes  A fine comedy club here in Times Square

That's kind of cool  Yes  All in there  Plastic little  Sheaths  Right  Yes  My Half a Hulk comic book  We looked it up already  It's worth a whopping 4 bucks  4 bucks  But what was the sticker price?  I don't know  Like a quarter  A quarter?  See  It was from 1979  I think percentages  Not price 
[00:04:00]  It was 40 cents  40 cents  That is some ROI  So it went up 10 times  That's not bad  Still in the plastic  Big return  Big return  Looks brand new  Smells brand new  Yeah  It's a good one  So very excited  If you hang on to that for another 200 years  You are going to be able to cash out  I can't wait  I think  Hey we got to get right into this  There's so much stuff going on in the news  Oh my god  I was watching so many videos yesterday  What do you mean?  Like that video of the shooter  Yeah the shooter is just amazing 
[00:04:30]  That's the top  I think that's top video story of the news today  That's the one you're going to be seeing  Top video story?  Yeah  You're going to be seeing it every two seconds  This guy  He's at a school board meeting down there in Florida  Mmhmm  And he paints like the V for Vendetta  Circle and V behind him at the podium  Where he's supposed to be speaking  And then he pulls out a heater  A rod  A piece  22 pistol  Is 22 good?  A little small for killing people  Is it? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah  You know  What kind of damage does it do?  It makes little holes  It's mostly a rabbit gun  It'll kill people  Oh  Mark my words  You will kill people  And he did kill himself with it  So you've got to hit the right spot though  Yeah you've got to hit the right spot  And 22's do a lot of damage  Because they're  They're not really a high speed round  They do a lot of tumbling  They bounce off of shit once they go in you  So you can rip it up  As a matter of fact  President Reagan  Shot with a 22  Oh no kidding 
[00:05:30]  And it did a lot of damage  Dude I was just watching that footage the other day  Just the  Yes  The other day  Where's mommy?  And you forgot  Just in  You know  In the  What was it?  80 I guess?  Yeah  I think it was 1980  Around there  Only a mere 30 years ago  You could still get really close to the president  Yeah yeah  You know that changed everything  Mr. Reagan  Right  Mr. President  Right  Now when the president's in your town  They completely close down the city itself  Yeah you aren't getting that close  But only 30 years ago  You still pretty much could walk up to him 
[00:06:00]  And say  Hey you're doing a good job  Reagan was smiling and waving  Hello  Yeah  Hello  And then pow  But that was a 22  Yeah yeah  He got hit with a 22 on that one  It was a special kind of round  So it fragmented  And really fucked him up  Collapsed the lung and shit  Reagan was an animal  Oh yeah  That guy  Couldn't kill him  It took years to fucking  Even after he got the Alzheimer's  It took years and years and years  Guy had the cancer  The fucking  He was shot  What was the line he said to the doctor?  I hope you're a Republican 
[00:06:30]  Or something  I hope you're a Republican  Before they took care of him  And then he also said  Mommy I should have ducked  Yeah  Mommy  That's so creepy  He had the lines  Mommy  Did he?  A little creepy to call your wife mommy  Especially when you're the president  Yes  Anyway back to the school board  Yeah the school board guy  Pulls out the 22  Pulls out the gun  And he tells the women  Like there's a stenographer in there  And some other women  To leave  A couple other people he tells to leave  But he tells the six like board members 
[00:07:00]  That are up at the podium  That they gotta stay  Yeah obviously he had the problem with them  Yeah  So he had a problem with his wife  Being fired from her job  But he got into other things  About taxes  And he was kind of rambling  Toward the end a little bit  And he's waving this gun around  And one of the guys on the board  Is actually saying  Look I'm the one that signed off on it  I don't know what your wife does  I don't know her name  But I was the one that signed the paper  I'm the one you have business with 
[00:07:30]  Let all these people go  He was trying to be like the hero guy  The funniest part of this whole clip  And funny you know in terms of what it is  No it's hilarious  But it is hilarious  It is hilarious  When he tells the women to leave  They all leave  Look at that lady  Alright I'm out of here  And then this one woman  Comes creeping back with her pocketbook  Yes  Holding it by the strap  She comes creeping in  Look at her  And whacks his hand  That's holding the gun 
[00:08:00]  And fails miserably  He turns around  Grabs her  Just subdues her in two seconds  Stares down at her  As she's screaming  Ah!  Ah!  Because she obviously thinks  She fucked up  And now she's going to be shot  The guy just goes  Get out of here  She came creeping in like  Dunk dunk  And whacks him with the pocketbook  Turn the sound up on that  Let's see if we got some sound  Here she comes  She's creeping in  Make sure you check this out  At home today  He hits her 
[00:08:30]  I mean  And then he just looks at her like  What the fuck were you thinking?  He just looks at her like  Come on man  Like get out of here  If you're going to do that move  You can't miss  She made the  I'm dead scream  Play it one more time  Listen to the initial scream  When she realizes  Her little ruse didn't work  Hey sir  John  John  And the way she comes creeping in  She's tiptoeing in 
[00:09:00]  Yeah  Like Ruth Buzzy  I got him  She's doing a Ruth Buzzy  For the older people out there  She's like  Ah!  I'm dead!  And then he just looks at her  Like dismissingly  Kind of like  You asshole  And obviously  If he was a real psycho  He would have shot her right there  He would have shot her right there  And other people  I've read comments on this video  They're saying like  The second she did that  The guy closest to him  Should have gotten up  And grabbed the gun  Or something  The two guys should have gotten him  Because he was distracted  Sure  But uh 
[00:09:30]  She was trying to be a hero  With her little fucking purse  Who's the other lady?  Did she ask permission to leave?  I don't know  I think she's one of the  Yeah yeah  I think she did  She's like  Can I leave?  Yeah  I want out of here  Yeah  Get the hell out of here  And then he talked to them  For uh  You know  About five minutes  Or maybe longer  I'm not sure exactly  How long this went on  And the guys  Were just trying to plead with him  Like hey look  We can talk this out  And one guy was just like  He's  He fails miserably  At hostage negotiation  The guy fails miserably  What was his move? 
[00:10:00]  His move was like  Look  Uh  You know  I know you came in here  Saying you wanted to die  So  I  I don't want to  I don't want to die  Please explain  Please sir  And what was the V about?  I'm not sure  She'll be for Vendetta  He drew that  Yeah  He drew that  With a spray paint can  And they looked on  A little puzzled  Until he pulled the gun out  And they realized  Uh oh  I'm a good guy  I've got a lot  With my wife and family  I don't need to die  And I don't want 
[00:10:30]  I want the sausage  The way it was  Jimmy Dean's sausages  Eleven and a half years  I've got a great wife  I've been married to a four  Yeah  It sounds like Jimmy Dean guy  Yeah  I've got two great boys  Just please  Just talk to us  If I can help you  Get your wife a job  Somewhere else  I'll be glad to do that  This is the guy  Bargaining with him  No you  No you're not  What did she do?  I mean  Because I really don't know  Who you're talking about 
[00:11:00]  To be very honest  With you  I have no idea  He's like  I have no idea  What you're talking about  Your wife  Fuck her  I don't know  Yeah  But what did she do?  Come on  I don't  He's  He's not very rational  He's not talking a lot  If you fast forward now  To  Close to the end  So they just talk like this  For quite a while  He hasn't shown a gun yet?  No no he's got the gun  He pulled the gun out  The second he spray painted the thing  He's got it in his hand  Oh okay  It's like you know  He's on the other side of the desk  So they can't really rush him  Or anything  But you're obviously upset at me  So why are they here? 
[00:11:30]  This guy's gonna  Come up  Part of what?  Hero guy  Look at him  Sir I don't know  What you ran  To stop  He's like being  Obnoxious  Part of why?  Yeah  Like  Plenty of money  Then as soon as  You got it  The school system  Then you turned around  And said  Oh now we need  The sales tax again  Yeah you can go  Now they start talking taxes  You can go a little further forward too  We're running out of that  Listen to me for a minute 
[00:12:00]  I don't want anybody to get hurt  And I've got a feeling  That what you want  Is the cops to come in  And kill you  Because you're  Holy shit  It's like  This guy's  An epic fail  At hostage  You think everyone  Is behind  Everyone  Now look  Points the gun  And there he goes  Blast one off at the floor  Now he's trying to  Shoot security  Security shoots him  In the leg  And then he  Shoots himself  In the head  He could be  The worst shot ever  He gets one shot off 
[00:12:30]  Really  At the six members  He goes right  He goes way right  On the guy he's aiming at  And then  Boom  The round goes off  Into the floor  Now he's starting to be  Shot at  So he's shooting  At the guy  That's shooting at him  He gets hit  In the leg  And he falls down  And then shoots himself  In the head  Jesus  Which they haven't shown  I need the raw footage  Of this fucking security camera  God damn it  We always get the raw footage  I'll see him blow his brains out  We get the raw footage  What an idiot  But the first shot  The guy made believe he was hit  It looked like  I think he might have thought  He was hit 
[00:13:00]  Like he probably felt the shock  And a lot of shit  Came up off his desk  So he grabbed his arm  Figuring I got hit  Thinking he  Might have been thinking  I'm just speculating  Thinking he got hit  But um  And then the guy  Realized security was there  He lowers his gun  And a round goes off  Into the floor  Jesus  And then uh  He'd had it at that point  Uh  That was pretty much it  What a weird video  Although the cops  Should have just unloaded on him  The second  He  He had that gun out  Like what  What were they waiting for  I don't know  The guy's got six hostages 
[00:13:30]  He's walking around  With the gun pointed at the floor  You just fucking  I think uh  And then driving in  I was thinking  Maybe the guy wanted  Like suicide by cop  Um  And intentionally missed the guy  Uh  Hoping then  That would make the guy shoot  Finally  That's the CNN footage  It's not fucking  CNN's not gonna have the  It ends  They don't even show  The guy shooting 
[00:14:00]  Why?  It ends with like  A freeze frame  And then you hear  Pop pop pop pop  I don't know  Oh really?  They're all afraid  It's too close  It's in the country  If it was  Out of the country  Shooting is allowed  Yeah then they would show  Okay now they're  Showing that guy  He gets shot in the leg  Oh they might  Uh  This has a little left  Oh no  Oh come on  And then it goes  Gunman apparently missed  Each person he fired on  He later  Killed himself  After being wounded  By school board security  Yeah we're trying to see  If there's more footage out there  Even LiveLeak doesn't have it  We need like 
[00:14:30]  The fucking  They didn't shut  The security cameras off  It'll come out  All that stuff  Always makes it  Eventually  Give it a day  Give it a day yeah  Or a few hours even  Give it some time  Everyone is hustling  Trying to get the raw footage  Up on their site  I'm sure  I think they think  There are two videos  This one is where  The guy gets shot  Yeah but they don't have  The guy getting  He gets shot  We've seen that  But we don't see  The guy shooting  Himself in the head  I don't see him  Shoot himself in the head  With his little BB gun  The lady creeping in though  Is classic  That's the best part 
[00:15:00]  Of the whole thing  I saw a close up  Shot of that too  There's a tighter shot  Of that  Where she just  The way she's creeping  She's holding her  Pocketbook by the strap  And she's doing  You can almost hear like  Dunk  Dunk  Dunk  Dunk  Dunk  Dunk  Dunk  Dunk  Dunk  Dunk  And she swings  The fucking pocketbook  With no result  Whatsoever  None  Whatsoever  God bless her  Tiny little heart  Oh and then she  Tried to be the hero  He grabs the fucking 
[00:15:30]  Pocketbook  She drops it  And screams  Cause she's dead  And I think  That my wife  Shouldn't have been  The fuck is that  The fuck  I don't think  You were fair  And just  That my wife  Had to be  Fuck  The fuck  The hell is this  Crazy bitch  Doing  She hit me  With her pocketbook  Hit me  With the pocketbook  And then of course  After she swings  The pocketbook  And fucks up 
[00:16:00]  Everything  One of the board  Members was  Heard saying this  This is going  Great  Yeah  Yeah  I'm breaking  Your balls  And you  Get it  When you're  Getting  Fucking  Fish  Yeah  I'll go home  And get your  Fucking shine box  That's what he  Told her  And then she  Said this  I was only joking  The rest of the board  We're changed  For nothing  She sucked 
[00:16:30]  Another board member  I  Nigh  She  She was  Completely  Ineffective  Completely  Ineffective  She  Fucking  Blow it  You  Blow it  She  Blow it  We look like  Assholes  Right now  Man  Fuck's sake  Man  You're  Amateur  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That was  That was 
[00:17:00]  Hmm  That was the  The guy with the gun  Hey bud  What's your problem  Pretty much  She really  Did not  Have  No  She didn't  Have it figured  Out  But she was  Later interviewed  And there is  A reason  Yeah  Of course  Actually  That he  Knew she  Was coming  He said  I can smell  Your cunt  Yeah  So  So she didn't  Have a chance  Even before  She swung  No  Swung the hand  Wow  I didn't know  That happened 
[00:17:30]  Yeah  Yeah  He had a great  Sense of smell  Where's that audio  I didn't  See that yet  Uh  Yeah  That's  An attention getter  It certainly is  And then  Of course  The gunman  Man  You are  One pathetic  Loser  Yeah  Yeah  That was  A pathetic  Attempt  At being  A hero  You get  Nothing  You lose  Good day  Sir  Oh god 
[00:18:00]  Not good  Very terrible  She was very  Upset too  After  Yeah  Yeah  Oh no  One of those  That's okay  Don't worry about it  It didn't go  It was an E-Rock  I bring nothing  To the table  Yeah  Yeah  That's a big  Story today  Big story  Yeah  And if you get  A chance  To see the video  Make sure you  Look at the lady  Everybody will see  The video today  Her handbag  Her little smart  Pocket book  Well honestly 
[00:18:30]  Probably the  The good old TV  Won't show the old lady  Because they gotta get  They gotta get  To weather and traffic  But that's great  Go online for the  Long form video  So you see the old lady  Creeping up with her  Pocket book  I foresee  Interviews with her  I see a little  Interview with her  On the news  What she was thinking  What happened  I call her today  The dumbest person alive  Just an ass  You're in a  Horrendous situation  Look they're showing it again  This video is  Gonna just be  Every other minute  Yeah that's the  Number one video  You're in a horrendous 
[00:19:00]  Situation  And you're told  To leave  And then you sneak  Back with your pocket book  To try to be a hero  This is the closer shot  Everyone's leaving  Yeah yeah  Here she is  Okay  This is the closer shot  And then for tomorrow  Nah  They got the weather  Oh look they cut it off  Why did they cut  As she's swinging  Were they teasing it  This guy's a crazy motherfucker  He's just crazy  Looks like Artie Lang  I was just about to say that  It's Artie shooting a gun  I was just about to say that 
[00:19:30]  Did you see the round  Go off in the floor  There she is  The old lady creeping up  Yeah I got you  Yeah  And then he's just like  Hey lady  Do it  Did I tell you to leave  Or something  That's when he painted the V  He doesn't have the gun out yet  And they're just kind of looking like  Sir what are you  And then he pulls the gun out  And they're like  Oh  Oh shit  Okay  Oh shit  Now I understand  Someone likes watching movies  You know if somebody was armed in there  Wow could they have taken him out  Look at this 
[00:20:00]  People walking behind him  Like look at this lady  She walks behind him  And if that woman  Was able to have a gun  She could just unload it on his head  And there's the lady creeping again  Back of the head  He never would have known  He turns his back to that committee also  Yeah  At one point  Like he had his back completely  They had plenty of opportunities  To take him out  Plenty of opportunities  They're not allowed to just go  I love when they said  All the women could leave  These women were like  Alright  I'm coming back with my handbag  I'm coming back  Now Ann 
[00:20:30]  You know a little bit about casinos  We've got to move right on  To the second video clip  Yes  This is another biggie  Unfortunately this would have been  The number one video clip  If it wasn't for the gunman  Yeah  Gunman took this guy's thunder  So this was Vegas right  Yes  The Bellagio  The Bellagio  Big hotel out there in Vegas  And this guy stole  How many chips?  I believe  One million dollars  Worth of chips  From the Bellagio  2.5 million dollars worth  Of high stake Bellagio chips  Now on the way in today  I was discussing this with Kenny  Yeah 
[00:21:00]  And Kenny goes  They already changed the chips  It doesn't matter what this guy did  So  Can't change the chips  Then I brought that knowledge to you  And you're like  It would probably cost more money  To change all the chips  Exactly  Than you know  Lose the money that this guy got  From stealing those chips  Yeah  To change the chips  It would cost more than  One and a half million dollars  To change every Bellagio  Fucking chip  It's insane  What I'm thinking is  He's either gonna fence them  And sell them for  You know  Pennies on the dollar  Kind of a thing 
[00:21:30]  To get rid of them  Or  Hire people to go in  And play with them a little  Change them out  Cash them  It doesn't seem like  He's gonna  Get away with a lot of money  In the end  They said  They have security measures  In place  In the chips  Oh radio frequency ID  They got like  I don't know  That's pure assumption  I have no idea  Like they won't say  Because they don't want to  They don't want people  To know what their security is  I heard about that  I didn't know  If it's implemented yet  Or not  Or if they've done this yet 
[00:22:00]  I'm not sure  What in every chip  They got an RFID  In every chip  They would have  Something that would  I think this guy  Only got away with  Like very high value  Like you know  Very high end  So even if they only  Put it in the high end chips  I mean still  He didn't get out  With fucking  You know  1.5 million  In rig  In nickels  Yeah  No I understand that  Let me play some nickels here  But it seems kind of stupid  Because it doesn't seem like  He's going to get his money  He's done it before  Or at least the MO  Is that  They say that this guy  Has done it before  At another casino  And what's the story  He went in armed 
[00:22:30]  He goes in  He's armed  He's wearing a motorcycle helmet  Some type of  Didn't that tip off people  That the guy's walking around  A casino  With a motorcycle helmet on  He's very fast  He goes in  Okay  He does the robbery  He gets the chips  He puts them in  I think he's  It looks like he's got  Big pockets on the side  Of his pants  How many chips do you think  I don't know  It depends on what  Denomination he's taking  But I mean  When the video shows him running  It looks like he doesn't  Have a lot of chips on him  No  Obviously  Something's flapping  But  Yeah  And then he runs  Out to his motorcycle 
[00:23:00]  Which is outside  And a sport bike  And just fucking  Takes off  Books ass out of there  And got away  But yeah  The whole thing comes into play  Like how does he get rid  Of these things  Does he  You know  Sell them  To a fence  Maybe  You know  Hey I'll give you  A fucking  I'll give you  50,000 Bellagio chips  For fucking  Five thousand dollars  Yeah but they're gonna  Be on to anybody  That is cashing in  The big chips now  He don't care at that point  He's just getting rid of them  Yeah but who  Who does he get  Who does he give them to 
[00:23:30]  And how  How do those people  Not talk  Someone desperate  Or a fence  Or somebody  An organization  Maybe it's not just him  Maybe he's just the guy  That steals them  Like you don't  You don't know  Yeah  It's one of those deals  Where uh  I'm sure we'll find out  It's gonna make a great movie  Yeah I'm sure  Starring George Clooney  Yeah someone said  Ocean's 15 and a half  Or something  Yeah I don't understand  The end result on that one  I would just  Why not just rub a bank  You get some money from it  There's  It's not like a casino

[00:26:00]  I am  Here's my prediction  Yeah  Everyone  That has never played the game  Will be at the final table  Everyone that is really good  Will be knocked out  By people that play  Seven deuce offsuit  Well  And fucking  And keep going into your raise  And then pull a seven  And two deuces on the flop  Proving that poker is all luck  Not all luck  But proving that  Proving there is a lot of luck  At times  When you get a situation like this  Luck seems to rear its ugly head 
[00:26:30]  Really?  Okay  Yeah  Yeah  You're gonna get knocked out  By a lame hand aren't you?  I know  I am gonna have pocket aces  Here's my demise  Okay  Here's my demise  I'm spelling it out right now  Alright  I am going to have pocket aces  Some schlep  Is gonna have an 8-5 offsuit  Offsuit  I'm gonna raise pre-flop  Because I don't like fucking around with aces  Are you talking to the players right now?  Yeah  Okay  I'm gonna do a little raise in pre-flop  This dick bag 
[00:27:00]  Isn't gonna fold his shitty hand  Right  He's gonna call my raise  Right  The flop's gonna come out  It's gonna pair one of his fucking cards  So he's gonna think I'm an instant winner  Because I paired my fives  Okay  So then I'm gonna raise again  He's gonna stay in  Because he's got  Ooh a pair of fives  And then the next card  Will come out  And either be a 5 or an 8  Which will give him 3 of a kind  Or 2 pair  And I'll again raise  Because I got my aces  He'll stay in  And draw the final card  Which will give him a full house 
[00:27:30]  And I will be completely fucked  And I don't know much about poker  What are the odds of that happening?  Astronomical?  No  All too often  When you're playing well  But when you're playing the right way  Yeah  What are the odds that ends up happening in the end?  It's rare  Yeah  It's rare  But you know what?  It just happens  And you wanna fucking choke the son of a bitch  That plays like that  But then their excuse is like  Hey it's poker  Anything could happen  I can play however I want 
[00:28:00]  And it is true  You want people to follow some kind of  Uh  No  And you know what?  No  It is true  But  It's just  You're  You're losing  To a shitty player  Regardless of what they say  Like hey I can play however I want  It's true  You can  But it's not that I lost to you  And you played wrong  You didn't play wrong  It's your game  You can play however you want  But I lose to a shitty player  That got so fucking lucky  And should have been out of the hand  Three fucking times  It's just one of the 
[00:28:30]  I know  I can't wait  I know that's gonna be my demise  It's gonna be  I'm gonna fold pocket aces  Because I just know  It's gonna be my fucking demise  What happens if Iraq  Ends up  Taking you out?  Oh if Iraq takes me out  With that shitty hand  Yeah  I'm really gonna be angry  I don't come in Monday  I'll throw the fucking cards at him  Like Pesci did at the dealer  Hey yeah yeah  Look at his fucking winner  Now I can't wait to see  How you get knocked out  Oh it's just  It's gonna be  It's gonna be horrible  It's gonna be a horribly ugly way  Sure

[00:32:00]  With that sir  We started the show  With the top story  Of the day  Which is the  School board shooting  Everyone has seen it  Everyone  Everyone  It's 2010  The second something happens  Everyone sees it  What the fuck  Were you thinking  You stupid ignorant  Son of a bitch  Dumb bastard  Jesus Christ  I met some dumb bastards  In my time  But you outdo them all  Wrong  Try again  Dumbass  Holy shit

[00:33:00]  I have to agree  Where do we go from here  Oh a cop  Cop wants to explain  Why they didn't shoot that guy  I'm a cop you idiot  Steve in Buffalo  What's up Steve  First of all  How much snow do you have  In Buffalo  Oh way too much  Way too much  Yeah  Hell up here  I don't fucking miss the snow man  Don't miss that shit at all  You guys got lucky  Getting out of here  With the  Wind effect  Bullshit  That's cold here too  Shut up  It is kind of cold  But at least we don't have 
[00:33:30]  The snow every fucking day  Pounding us over and over again  Anyways  Yeah you got something  On the school board shooting  Earlier you guys  You guys stated  He pulled out the gun  And you were wondering  Why they didn't shoot him  Yeah  As cops  We're told  We're not allowed to shoot somebody  If they show the gun  There's three reasons  Why we have to  We can shoot them  There's means  Opportunity  And intent  He had the means 
[00:34:00]  With the gun  The opportunity  Everybody was there  But at the moment  He wasn't pointing the gun  At anybody  So he didn't really have  The intent  At that time  You know what  You take him out  And hope for the best  He was kind of  Waving that gun around  A little bit  I think it came up  A couple of times  And might have  You know  Hey  As an avid gun lover  And a person that  Believes everybody  Should be shot  If they do something stupid  I would have shot him  Right away  And how about  When that woman  Hit him with the purse  And he spun around 
[00:34:30]  And grabbed her purse  Now I would  Absolutely  If I was  Law enforcement  I would think  That right there  Is that woman  Is going to be shot  Right  And that's all  You really need  Is to go in front  Of the grand jury  And say like  Hey look  I absolutely thought  She was dead  Obviously  The system doesn't work  Because the guy  Was allowed to  Get a couple shots off  And then they decide  Okay now I'm allowed  To shoot him  That doesn't make sense  Exactly  It doesn't fucking  Make sense  We say it up here 
[00:35:00]  I'd rather be judged  By 12 than carried  By 6  So I mean  If he would have  Pulled that gun out  I would have shot  Right away  You would have to  This picture  I'm looking at a picture  Of the woman creeping  Out with her pocketbook  It's not the video  It's still pictures  This picture is going  To be photoshopped  I predict this is  The next looter picture  Yeah this is  This is internet  Sensation picture  Of epic fail woman  Is there a series of them 
[00:35:30]  Sam over there  Or is it just a one  Yeah yeah  She's  Oh my god  With her pocketbook  And her Jackie O shirt  Oh my god  Her Jackie O jacket  What site is this on  Daily Mail  Dumbfuck.com  Dailymail.co.uk  It could be even better  Than the video  Because you see her  Just sneaking up  Behind with her pocketbook  Right there  A guy could shoot  Look at that  Look at that shot  Right there  It's like  He's pointing the gun  At her head  Pretty much  I want to know  The story  Why she decided  She had to come back  In and try that  She's a hero 
[00:36:00]  Not many people  Would try that  I saw a horrible  Video on some guy  It was in a convenience store  And it was this big  Fucking muscular guy  And some skell  Had a gun  He's pointing it  At the counter  Robbing the place  And this big  Strong guy  Comes over and grabs  The guy with the gun  The guy with the gun  Is able to kind of  Get out of his grip  Spin around  And shoot the guy  Once in the side  And now the guy  Is pretty much  Incapacitated  He puts his hands up  Like  Alright look  Look this is done 
[00:36:30]  I tried that  Guy just  Pop right in the top  Of his head  Shoots him  It's so sick  But it's like  That's why  Don't fucking  Don't try to take  A guy's gun away  With your hands  Unless you got  Another gun  Sit there  And shut the fuck up  Unless you're  In imminent  Imminent danger  Of being shot  Abso-fucking-lutely  Alright  Crazy  Wow  Busy day  Patrice O'Neill  Coming in today  Right  Jimmy's in LA  Doing some Leno  Yeah  Jimmy's  Being a big Hollywood star 
[00:37:00]  He'll be back tomorrow  Being a big star  Jimmy will be back tomorrow  What else  I don't think we have  Anyone else coming in today  No guests  That's nice though  I like when we have  A break from the guests  I like that  People are enjoying  The guests that have  Been coming on the show  But it's also nice  To just do the hang  Right  Just like  Because when guests  Come in  It's like  You're constantly  Looking at the clock  What time are they  Coming in  What do I got to say  To this fucking person  Sometimes  Then we don't even  Know how to tell them  That their time is over  Could you just leave  And also we're just  Hanging out with the guy 
[00:37:30]  We should have a red light  Like the comedy clubs  Where they just get a red light  And they gotta leave  Every other show  Knows how to get rid of a guest  We don't know  Yeah  Next thing you know  I'm having breakfast  With half these people  I'm like  What am I doing  You should have done  20 minutes on the show  And gone  Two hours later  You're still here  We should have some kind  Of a funny sign  Where you can just  Pull a string  And it comes up  On a pulley  Like your time's up  Like really blatant  And blunt  But they have to laugh  Because it's so  Ridiculously done  And I'm not  I don't want to confuse people  Kevin Hart yesterday  Stayed an hour 
[00:38:00]  Hour and a half  Or whatever  He was awesome  We're not talking about him  Laughing my balls off  He was terrific yesterday  But there are times  We don't know how to  Get rid of the guests  I know  It's very difficult  We just don't know how  Eh  Maybe trap door  Maybe  We could trap door  This fucking place  You think they'd install  A trap door  With a slide  That goes out to the street  How about Kenny  With a hook  Let's go old school  That would be good  Kenny comes in  With an old  Vaudevillian hook  Just fucking grabs him  I like that idea  Your time is up  Get out 
[00:38:30]  You're out  And the phone's lit  They want to talk about  A lot of stuff  Alright  We'll take our first break  When we get back  You know  Sam had Billy Mitchell  On his show  The Sam and Dave show  He did  Billy Mitchell  The champion of Donkey Kong  Or is he?  Could we get into this?  That King of Kong  Is such a great movie  Yeah  Although if it wasn't  For that movie  He never would have had  All the problems  Holding on to his title  This late in his career  True  Because that opened up  That was like  When the gunslinger 
[00:39:00]  In the town  Where the word gets out  That there's a gunslinger  In town  And all the young guns  Come in  And want to challenge him  Right  But if the guy  Was just in town  And no one knew  He was the fastest gun  Who would challenge him  No one's going to challenge him  Exactly  But that's what happened  This movie came out  Everyone knew  He was top dog  And that was it  And Billy Mitchell  Is pretty much  The biggest ass  Oh what a tool  Walking this planet  Oh it'll be a little trivia  I want to know  If you know this  What initials  Did he put on  His high scores 
[00:39:30]  On the game  And why  That would be  U  S  A  The first part of the question  Answered correctly  Now why  I forgot the why  Hold on  Hey  It's easy  I forgot the why  I really did  Danny you want to  Feel this one  Well you see  You see  Well you see  Billy had a lot of  Multinational  Friends  Because when you  When you're gaming  At the level  Of a Billy Mitchell  Sure  Oh yeah  You know  You're going to be in  Well my answer would be  You're playing for the country 
[00:40:00]  You're going to be in the world's arena  Yeah  Worldwide  He wanted to make sure  He wanted to make sure that  USA was always on top  Always on top  USA always on top  Get it high score  First one on top  USA  Right  He's selfless by the way  Because he could have put his own initials up there  But he chose to put his country's initials up there  And wear an American flag tie  Like the tool he is  What a fucking asshole  But if you put BM  Everybody would just think it was a joke  Yes  That's true  What an asshole  If you've never seen King of Kong  Do yourself a favor  It's fantastic  There's so much going on with that movie 
[00:40:30]  And Sam had Billy Mitchell come in for like two hours  He was one of those guys  Where they didn't know how to get rid of him  How do you get rid of Billy Mitchell  And Sam talks about how they  The guy ate pretzels for two straight hours  Like a lunatic  He had a donkey kong machine  Bag after bag  He wanted to bring up  Right  And security wouldn't allow  But the building wouldn't allow it  It's like he carries around a donkey kong machine with him  He's something  I guess so  He is something  And Patrice O'Neill has entered the building  Ah Patrice  We'll have him in here next  And we'll go over this Billy Mitchell audio 
[00:41:00]  We should do that today  Yeah  The Opie and Anthony show  On the virus  Sirius XM  Want to welcome Patrice O'Neill into the studio 
[00:41:30]  Big Mama Prods on Twitter  Yes  One of the great Twitter accounts  Big Mama Prods  Very entertaining  Trace loves his sports  You saw the Jets play by now 
[00:42:00]  Right  Of course  Now there's more controversy  In the paper  With the guy tripping the guy  Yeah  But now  I couldn't figure out  Why he wasn't fired on the spot  And  Somebody who  Used to play for the Dolphins  Said look man  They were told to line up  And make a wall  Oh it's going to come out  That  Oh shit  The guy goes  On his  I guess he did it on his radio show  Down there in Miami  He's like  They were all told  To make a wall  So  And this is why  Those guys 
[00:42:30]  Push the guy out of bounds  So he can  Be pushed  And then hit this wall  And  Yeah  And then  Trip down the  It's strategy  Makes sense  Guys are running out of bounds  To kind of get  You know  Makes a lot of sense  And  You know  Rex Ryan I believe  Basically told these guys  You got to make a wall for me  Because  He said the coaches  Are never lined up like that  Toe to toe  Never  That looked weird  Didn't it  Right  They do it all the time  And they finally got caught  Because the guy  You know  Put his knee out  And that's why  He didn't get fired  Because he was told  To fucking at least 
[00:43:00]  Do the wall thing  I bet you that knee  Fucked up though  That he was just  So nervous about  Not being  He couldn't help himself  It was strategic  But here's my problem with him  I would've  If he said  Hey I had a brain fart  Right  Yeah yeah  I would've  I would've accepted it more  If he actually  Hit that motherfucker  Oh right  And just hit him  Yeah  Out in the open  And just go  I don't know  What the fuck I did  But  That knee made him  Look like a sneak  Like a sneaky little  Like you sneaky  Little cocksucker 
[00:43:30]  I was hoping to get away with it  So it's like  I was very surprised  He didn't get fired  That's such a fired move  It was so subtle  But that's why they're saying  He didn't get fired  Yep  And if that guy  Had been hurt  His career or anything  For a second  He would've  He would've been  It would've been  Jet slash that guy's name  I still think the guy's  I still think the guy's  In deep trouble  I think maybe they wait  Till the year's over  And then he kind of  Sort of goes away  Quietly  They give him some  Dough Rex  Something  I don't know  Taking a hit  For a good fella's move  They have a fucking  Some cannolis  And sages  For him when he get out 
[00:44:00]  You took your pinch  Like a man  You kept your mouth shut  Kept your mouth shut  Hey you broke your cherry  They buy him his own gym  Somewhere in  Fucking Canarsie  Fucking Canarsie  Johnny Douchebag's gym  He took the fucking  Hit for him  The fucking Jets  What's your team in football?  The Patriots  I would assume  I was about to say  Yeah  Well sometimes  I don't know  I'm a Patriots fan  Sometimes it gets all  Fucked up  I'm into the Patriots  Like Dennis Leary  He got mad at us  Because I assume Patriots  He goes  I told you 
[00:44:30]  It was the Packers  You don't listen to your guests  Got all mad at us  Yeah but fucking  He's a big time Boston guy  He goes to the Patriots games  I think  I think so too  Oh no that's  That's the other guy  That's  Oh fuck  I forgot his name  That's the guy  That's on the show  Clark  Oh Lenny Clark  Lenny Clark  Lenny's the Patriots guy  That's why I always ask now  Because I assume  It's gotta be Patriots  And I think I do know  It's Patriots with you  Brady looking ridiculous  No one's stopping Brady  This is the first time  Ever that I watch Brady  And consider him 
[00:45:00]  One of the best quarterbacks  I've always said  Really  Tom Brady  Bugs me  He's fucking so  Average  But  That game against the Jets  And this thing against  The Bears  He did a move on the Jets  In the pocket  That I've never  Like Michael Vick  Does more shit  To  He's  It's more like  I escape  Motherfucker  But  Tom Brady  Did something  Where he turned  To the right  And this guy

Oh my god  Look at this big man  Look at this  Here it is again  Oh I'm good  I'm gonna get him  And he's like  What the fuck  I told you to leave  He told all the women to leave  So she leaves  And she comes back sneaking  And wails him over the hand  With her bag  And then lets out a scream  When she fails  Thinking she's just gonna get her head blown off 
[00:54:00]  And CNN's got the exclusive interview  We'll have the audio in a minute or two here  Jesus  That guy looks like Rockets Red Glare  You know  The guy  You know Rockets Red Glare  No  He's the guy  The name is hysterical  He killed him  In talk radio  He was the guy that killed him in the end  Oh  He's that big  You're dead  You're dead fucker  Yeah  That fucking guy is huge  Yeah  We were like  We think he looks a little like Arnie Lang  And he also looks like 
[00:54:30]  That Barceau guy  Basil  Marceau  Right  Basil Marceau  He's a big guy  Okay that went nowhere  I don't know who that is  And this is him here  He was that weird politician  That made the TV commercial  Oh right  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  He looks a little like Basil  That's fucking scary  No shit it is  And then he pulls the gun out  And just starts shooting  Yeah you haven't seen the video yet  Can I please see this  He missed  He missed everybody  Every two minutes  And then security shot him 
[00:55:00]  Yeah but at this point  To protect the innocent  It's just gonna be  At this point  Him having a donut with him  At the end of this fucking thing  They're not gonna show what happened  No a guy killed himself  Oh he offed himself  He got shot in the leg  By a security guard  And then he shot himself  While he was laying on the floor  And this was all  Yeah later  Here's probably where he pulls the gun out  And the guy's like  He's turned to the board  And the guy's like  Puts his hands up  He's like no no  Please please no  Please  Please no  Wow  And then pop pop  Wow  He didn't hit that guy  And then boom  One discharge into the floor 
[00:55:30]  And then security  Bam  Shoots him in the leg  And then  Big gun battle  And he shoots himself in the head  Which they won't show  Motherfuckers  That is scary  Look how he just slowly  Points the gun  To the fucking guy  The guy's  Horrifying  That guy is not getting a job  As a hostage negotiator  And his wife's still  Unemployed  Yeah  He levels that fucking  Gun at him  And misses  He missed  Dude at the floor  Fucking buck buck move  That shit ain't right  And then the guy goes 
[00:56:00]  You see how he painted  You see how he painted the V on the wall too  Yeah I see that  That's just  Yeah he painted the V for Vendetta  Really you big fat dramatic  White trash  So  It's  It's dumb V  Paint a peace sign  How about  How about a picture of your wife  With  A picture of her with the circle  On the striped through  Yeah  Unemployment  Like job  How about one of those  Andre the Giant stickers  You fucking douchebag  Ah shit 
[00:56:30]  I think he shot low  I think he shot low  He hit like the papers  In front of the motherfuckers  Oh he  This guy  Yeah he shot low  Is that why the papers went flying  Yeah  Or is that because his hand was on him  No he shot low  Oh okay  That guy sucked  Oh shit  These motherfuckers  And now they're ducking for cover  And  You almost root for that guy  In some weird way  Oh man  But his wife  The guy goes  I'll get your wife  A job  He should have said  I'll hire her back right now  Right now 
[00:57:00]  Get her on the phone  Where's your wife at  I'll get her on the phone  Now she has no  Insurance  Yeah  Cause you can't get insurance  If you off yourself  Or  Or you killed the person  Yeah  She has no job  She has no him  At least she's got no him  That guy doesn't look like  Such a treat to live with  Well  I mean he was  He was fighting for her honor  Evidently  I guess  Maybe it was just for him  Cause she called him  A fucking useless  Fat piece of shit  And he said  I'll show you a useless  I'll go kill your bosses  So she killed two birds 
[00:57:30]  With one stone  This cunt  Yeah yeah  She's probably  Someone just relaxing  Fuck man  She was gonna get  She probably has that  Shitty voice  And she's probably  Why don't you go  And do something about it  I have no comment  At this moment  For the press  And then she just  Goes out on a date  Now is she  Is she  Have they interviewed her  Not yet  Now this whole thing  Is she alive  Are they sure she's alive  Yeah right  That's a very good question  They go back to her house  And she's  Taking a dirt nap  Dressed in her work clothes 
[00:58:00]  Like she was going to work  He might have  He might have  Offed her before he bounced  Maybe  Sometimes they do that shit  And where did this happen  What Midwestern fucking  It was Florida  Florida  Yeah  Yeah  What part of Florida  Florida's a big place  It's probably in the panhandle  You can go panhandle  That's a whole different  Fucking part of Florida  So  And then we got  The purse snatcher  In the parking lot  That didn't look like  A 22 I ever seen  That was a scary looking 22 
[00:58:30]  Yeah 22  It looked like  When he leveled it out  He kind of relaxed a little  The barrel went down  And he shot into the papers  And then  At that point  He put the gun down  And it fucking  Discharges into the floor  And then he got  Clipped in the leg  It looked like  From the school security guy  That had a gun on him  I thought 22s  Looked like  Starter's pistols  Or something  Yeah  We were talking about it  Before though  You get hit with a 22  They're low velocity  So they do a lot of  Bouncing around  That looked like a block  Or something  That didn't look like 
[00:59:00]  A punk ass gun  Inside  Inside guns are fucking loud  And they're fucking loud  Someone's got a question  Doesn't matter what it is  How did the guy  Get the gun inside  I guess there's not  Metal detectors  Probably not  It's a school board  It's a school board  Give a shit  Somewhere in Florida  A lot of schools  Have those metal detectors now  Although not in the white schools  And this guy  No not in the white schools  And that's where they should be  I'm not even trying to make a joke  They should be  There are metal detectors  In black schools  For knives  Or whatever  You might get sliced 
[00:59:30]  With a razor blade  Fucking those  But mostly in black schools  It'd be the girls  Because guys know  That there's a gun involved  So it's got to be  Some real shit  The bitches are crazy  Women are fucking  Women can put them  Buck 50s on each other's face  Yeah yeah  And then white schools  Is when the trench coat mafia  Comes around  Yeah but it's so rare  It's like bah whatever  We'll take the hit  It's rare?  Yeah it doesn't happen  Very often  School shootings  Considering how many schools  White people love to  The thing that white people do  This is the thing 
[01:00:00]  I know exactly who my enemy is  If you're black  White people could just be at work  Yeah  And then some douchebag  That just got fucking yelled at  By his boss  Yeah  Goes around parading around the office  Oh hi  Boom  Oh hello  You didn't get me coffee  When I asked for it  Boom  You got my fucking bagel order wrong  Bow  That's the thing that's scary  About when white folks  Lose it like that  It's an entire plan  Yeah  To off a lot of people 
[01:00:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  And then take yourself out  Yeah they usually do  Very rare black people do that  The guy in Connecticut did it  Yeah  Omar Thornton  Yeah  Oh yeah  Black guys will shoot guys  Throw them  And then just take the hit  Well I'll try to shoot you  This is black people  Yeah  I'll try to kill you  But I end up killing Opie  By myself  Yeah  You fucking  Spraying motherfucker  That's how every block party ends up  Some poor motherfucker  That was just there

They build those things for you  I could show you a Maybach right now  It's always there too  I don't even know if I want to give up the spot  Because people will go and check it out  Fucking car club car  I've been in those plenty of times  It's in a garage  It's great  It's in a  A public fucking parking garage  And it's there all the time  Because it's rarely driven 
[01:06:00]  There's so much dust on it  And it's a garage I use every once in a while  Guy's got some cash  And it's right there  And they let you go right up to it  And take pictures of shit  I think I got a couple pictures of it  I'll tweet  Guy's got some cash  I've seen a couple of  And I looked in the windows  What I'm saying  I'm like  This is why three hundred thousand for this  I don't get it  It's comfy  The seat is a little nicer in the back  Of course  It has champagne glass holders  So that your bubbly doesn't bounce around  While you're driving  This is Bugatti  No, no  That's the Mayback  The Mayback  Well, the Mayback is a luxury  It's like supposed to  It's made up to be a first class airplane

[01:09:00]  At the board meeting  At the gunman  The video that's everywhere  One swing  Hit his hand  It didn't faze him  She starts screaming  Because she just  She absolutely thought  At that point  He was going to  Drill her full of holes  And what's funny  It says Ginger  Talks about being  Almost a hero  Do we have  Do we have  Other people  That make that list  You can't be  Almost a hero  Almost a hero  Can you  You cannot  Take for granted  Movies and how  Important they are  She was doing  A movie thing  She did a movie thing  He was doing 
[01:09:30]  A movie thing  It was a lot  The guy  Who was negotiating  Was doing a movie thing  That was a movie thing  It was a movie thing  A whole movie thing  No one was being  A real human  It was just  Isn't it weird  What is she doing  Creeping up with her purse  Like the gun's  Going to hit the floor  And the guys  Are going to get up  And pin him  And she's going to  Say a sassy line  With the purse  Still in her hand  Well that'll teach you  She'll say some sassy lines  And then she'll walk out  The media's already there  Trying to interview her  And the cops  Oh wow  That's it  And then 
[01:10:00]  I always hated that  In movies  She'll talk about  What she carries  In her purse  Right  So how did you get him  I got him with this  She'll hold the purse up  And the purse will start  Selling like hotcakes  Ginger Ginger  Over here  Over here  Over here  Everyone's trying  To get her attention  Meanwhile  Reality  She swings  Misses  Screams like  She's going to get shot  She made that  Scream like  Like that's the last  Scream someone makes  Before you hear  Pop pop  So lucky  But people say  She'll be on Nancy Grace  Or whatever 
[01:10:30]  And they'll be giving her  That oh my god  That was so harrowing  And it's like  I'd be like  Hey dummy  Yeah  Well we got her  First interview  You were gone  She's going to do  A million of these today  Take yourself out  Of the fucking mix  Here's Ginger  And Ginger  You were almost a hero  And almost a victim  At the same time  We've got this video  You were excused  From the room  And here you are  Sneaking up behind him  And you take a big  Whack at his hand  With your purse  Didn't knock the gun  Out of your hand  And right at that moment 
[01:11:00]  We hear you cry out  And I can only imagine  What was going through  Your mind at that moment  And I'd love you  To tell me about it  Was oh my god  It didn't work  I'm about to die  That's pretty much  What was going through  My mind  I was concerned  About my guys  They were lined up  Like ducks in a row  He was already  Basically standing  On the same level  With them  I knew something bad  Was going to happen  That was my only option 
[01:11:30]  Was to see if I could  At least  Or somehow or other  Detain until  Somebody got there  To help us  Because my guys  Had three ring binders  And pencils  For protection  And that was all  You had a purse  You dumb fuck  Jesus  Oh stop it  And by the way  If she had time  To fucking do that  She had time  To do something  Better than her purse  What was around  That corner by the way  Was there something  Heavy to bash him  Over the fucking  Noggin with  You go to hit  His gun hand  With your dumb  Pocket book 
[01:12:00]  I love how the guy  Fucked up his circle  Yeah he had to make it twice  He's not really  A good tagger  He wasn't tagging  The wall well  Well one more clip  From Ginger  She talks about  Realizing she had  No plan B  So again  When you  When you  Took a swing at him  With your handbag there  And the gun  Didn't come out  Of his hand  Obviously everything  Was a blur  But what was the thought  That raced through  Your mind at that moment  My thought was  That plan A  Had failed 
[01:12:30]  And I didn't have  A plan B  Which was probably  Not one of the  Smartest things  I ever did  Wow  I mean he pointed  The gun at you  He said something  Angry to you  But he didn't  Pull the trigger  I mean you must  You must have felt  God intervened  Right at that moment  I did  I don't know why  He didn't pull the trigger  My sense  And I probably  Disagree somewhat  With Bill  Is that he  He wanted to be killed  Rather than kill  But as time passed  Obviously it appeared 
[01:13:00]  That he was getting  More and more ready  To do some real damage  And we're so thankful  Mike Jones saved the day  He saved all of their lives  Because he came in  Just in the nick of time  Or there would have been  A lot more bloodshed  That was a miracle  Yeah  Divine intervention  There it is  Good old Ginger  No plan B  No plan fucking B  She's on again  The way she tiptoes  And creeps out  Is the dumbest 
[01:13:30]  Fucking thing  We've seen the video  At least 50 times  We've been here an hour  You're such an almost hero  She'd have been better off  Taking the fucking straps  From her pocketbook  And wrapping them  Around his neck  Who's this guy a fucking  An expert or  What is he  I'm sure he's an expert  On handbags  He's the fucking  The designer of the handbag  Unless you have an anvil  In there  Don't swing it  Her with a stupid  Soft tissues in there  And old lady shit  It's old lady shit  In there 
[01:14:00]  He probably was mad  Because his hands  Smelled like  Fucking hip ointment  And shit  She's got lifesavers  For her grandchildren  In there  It's gonna take them out  I hate how the news  Has to talk about this  Very seriously  When there was a real  Funny comedy moment  In there  One person's laughing  At the slapstick  It was slapstick shit  Her sneaking up  With her purse  Well the problem is  That he died  Yeah fuck him  Fuck him though  But that's what I'm saying  But they would never say  Fuck him  No  Like y'all said something  While I was driving  And listening  Is that like  Even in the corporate world  They don't  Like  Those guys are not 
[01:14:30]  Allowed to live  Like  It's like  Here at  Something something  And something  You can't  Even protect yourself  You can get sued  Yeah yeah  For fucking killing  The guy that was gonna kill you  Like  Protect yourself  People are just drones  It's weird  It really is  It's like  Stepford people  It's just  It's like  It's body snatchers  Yeah yeah  Yeah  This big asshole  Is sitting there  With a V for Vendetta  He's spraying a V for Vendetta  And it's so cliche  But it's like  Who sits there 
[01:15:00]  And watches that shit  They watched him  Just do the spray paint  He actually had to do  The circle twice  Because the spray paint  Didn't come out  And then he makes the V  And they're all just looking like  Clue  And he's shaking the can  And he's shaking the can with the little  Yeah  With the little ball in it  The ball bearings in there  And he draws V for Vendetta  And then what's the next move  Goodbye everyone  I just did graffiti  To see  Really?  You're absolutely right  These people are not  People aren't very  You fired my wife  And cautious  Who is this idiot we fired?  Like there's no humanity 
[01:15:30]  It's like dude  We fired  We fired Gladys  Oh we're sorry  Oh my god  I wanted Gladys to stay  Wish we knew  It was her  You gotta be smart  When you're talking to these guys  These guys?  Yeah they didn't want her  Shit I got fired  And then I would have stood up  And looked at him and go  You fired me too  Motherfucker  And then walked out  You would have tried something  I've been a loyal employee  Of this school  You know what 
[01:16:00]  If I was in the suit  I'd have just started  Pretending to mop  I'm just a janitor  May I go?  Everyone likes to think  They would do the right thing  In a situation like that  But the fact is  It's every man for themselves  So you would go with  Patrice's scenario  Get your own ass  Out of the situation  The one guy tried to be a hero  By saying you know  I was the one that signed the papers  Well that guy's just  Everyone else  Why don't you let everyone else go  And he was pulling  Some movie shit there  Oh and the other guy  Should have went  Thank you 
[01:16:30]  Thank you Tim  And just walked off  And straightened their papers out  And just walked off  All walked out  Thank you Tim  Thank you  He's right  He did sign the papers  And they have a bust  Of his fucking head  In bronze  Sitting outside  Whisper to him  I'll say some nice things  At your wake for you  This is the new  Tim Memorial bathroom  Right  Fucking idiot  He was an idiot  Fucking risking my life  That's why I love Jesus so much 
[01:17:00]  Even if you don't believe in him  As a deity  As a man  Yeah  He died  He could have got out of that pain  By simply saying  I do not believe in God  Yeah yeah  But he has so much faith  That he took that beating  And I wouldn't take a hard pinch  For this human race  William Wallace also  Laying on that table  Getting disemboweled  And all he had to do  Is kiss that little fucking emblem  And say  You know  Yeah the king's the king  I pledge my honor 
[01:17:30]  And they would have just  Lopped his head off  And no more pain  But he had to go  Free  With his guts all over the place  And you know  They were using that big hook thing  And just ripping his  Fucking intestines  And I would have seen  The two motherfuckers  Sitting there  Watching me going  Yeah yeah  Damn niggas right  Dang it was helping me  He killed the most  That's the Irish motherfucker  And that red headed prick  That big cocksucker  I used to roll with his father  Just turning everybody 
[01:18:00]  Tell long jeans I'm fucking  Long jeans  Tell him I'm sorry  Motherfucker  I tweeted that the other day  Because I was watching that  And I was like  The second Longshanks  Throws that fag out the window  Oh well  Why don't you tell me  About the defense  And what we should  Wham!  Throws his son's boyfriend  Out the fucking window  The funniest part of that  Is when he hits the ground  The two guards 
[01:18:30]  Down at the bottom  Look up at the window  Look down at the body  And just run away  Like oh Longshanks  Is at it again  Let me tell you something man  That's  That's why  I mean  In the least  People who die  For beliefs  Should be  And die for the freedom  Of motherfuckers  They don't know  Right  Yeah  I'm just running  You'll never catch me  Just running through  Black areas  With the music  In the background  Of flute music  Just killing guys 
[01:19:00]  With horses  And fucking  What do they call  The ball  With the  The mason  The mason  And the battle hammer  It's just  And to this day  Interesting enough  English people  Are still horrified  Of Scotsmen  Yeah  Wow  That's redheaded  Redheaded people  Because they're  You know  Ginger haired Scotsmen  Yeah  They're horrified of them  Scared to death  Some fucking  Scottish people  They're some fucking  When Longshanks  Walks in  And it's like  He gets the message 
[01:19:30]  That they've sacked York  And they send his fucking  What is it  His nephew  Or his  Cousin's head  In the box  And that's when  The son is there  And stuff  He's my military  My new military advisor  And the fruity guy  Looks like  I show him  Yeah right in the ass  Who is this person  Speaking as if  He should be advising me  He's like  Who the fuck  Is this idiot  Long jeans  Long jeans  I love long jeans  Long jeans  I love long jeans  I'm just gonna call them 
[01:20:00]  Long jeans  It's gotta be long jeans  Long jeans is one  Of the greatest assholes  In cinematic history  He's the great  I mean that guy  Was such a douche  Even though there's a douche  That the guy  That played a douche  To  The high  I think  I put him up to  The highest level  Of douche bag  Is the fucking guy  From  The guy from  Bastards  Oh  Inglourious Bastards  Yeah yeah  The Nazi  That guy  Is the greatest 
[01:20:30]  Asshole  In the history  Of fucking movies  When they're on the battlefield  And it's like  You know  Should we send the archers  And he goes  Arrows cost money  Send the Irish  And he just sends the Irish  But son  That's our people too  Yeah  And then  And then yeah  When they're battling  In the middle  He's like  Yeah  He goes  But we can't  Use the archers  We'll hit our own people  He goes  Well  We'll hit theirs too  What do you do  He goes  Fire  And he goes  I'm gonna send the daughter off  And he goes  She goes  But something could happen to her  I'm sure my son 
[01:21:00]  Will be  Really upset about that  My fucking sissy son  Everything he said  Was this sarcastic  Smarmy shit  And it was wonderful  It was great  He was such a prick  But that's what I'm saying  This guy  He saw Braveheart  Forty times  Yeah  This was it  Are you  I  Fired your wife  And he turned  Firing  His wife  Into some noble  Gesture 
[01:21:30]  Into his wife  Being put against the pole  And having her throat slashed  And the fucking guy  Licking her face  By the tent  Yeah that's what he saw  A firing  I must regain her honor  I did it  Let them go  Like  Is that it  You piece of shit  Today we will fight  For freedom  No  Not really  Isn't anybody  Would you do that  Would you  You know that old question  Would you go back in time 
[01:22:00]  The pause doesn't mean I'm  And fucking kill Hitler  Or kill one of these people  That did some fuck  Like would you go back in time  And do that  That example  Well  No  It's  Yeah yeah  Like  Would you go back in time  And kill Shaka Zulu  If it could save any lives  Shaka Zulu  Oh shit  Would you stop  I mean I don't  I'm not sure  To like change history  Or some shit like that  I'm not sure  I could  I could take  Take a fat one  For any  Any of these people  That's pretty rough 
[01:22:30]  They're not worth it  Especially if there's  A danger factor  For you  I used to  I used to come up  With some really  Fucked up  Like scenarios  In my head  As far as  Entertainment fantasies  Would go  I think we spoke about this  A while back  Where I'd be at work  At some inane job  And just think about  Like dumb shit  And everything would have  To be really detailed out  Whether it was  Some kind of space travel  Or zombie attacks  Or whatever it was  Whatever it was  I was occupying my fucking time 
[01:23:00]  Touched through the day  And that's all I had to do  Well there was one idea  I had where  If time travel was possible  And you could turn it  Into an amusement type thing  Where you actually got  To go back in time  And spend the last minutes  Of the Titanic  On the fucking Titanic  Knowing that we'll  Snatch you back  When you're done  But you actually get  To experience  What it was like  To be on that ship  Sinking  And then  Whoop  You zap back  And like  Wow that was fucking cool  That would be amazing 
[01:23:30]  Fucking cool  And like  You could just  Go and do things  And being like  Now could you come back  Could you come back  And report  Exactly what happened  That  Yeah you could  Like the men were  Fucking just throwing  Fat bitches out of the way  You could  Not this romantic  I guess you could  I guess you could  Got on a fucking  I guess you could  And I  You're so right man  I detailed all this shit out  Where they would have to  Make it really safe  So you'd have to send  Either robotics  Or advanced people  To know that  Wherever you're being sent  You're not going to get hurt 
[01:24:00]  So like  The invasion of Normandy  You want to be on  Fucking Omaha Beach  There's an advanced team  That makes sure  You're in a place  Where no bomb went off  No bullet pass  And you are there  Watching fucking  As bolts are flying by  All that shit go by  And then they yank you out  And you're like  I now know what the fuck  That was like  To really  Not a movie  Not anything you're experiencing  And I used to think  Like that would be  The coolest fucking thing  To do  How about  But not  But you could get  But then there are rules  Like you can't get involved  How about Quint's 
[01:24:30]  Shark story  Boom  Oh  The USN's  Indianapolis  In the water  In the water  Just fucking floating around  In the water  Carrying the boom  Yeah but see  See it's  The scenario  Here's a shima boom  The scenario's easy  If you know you're  You're going to be yanked back  That's just it  But then you know  There's got to be like  Some kind of odds  Where one out of a hundred  You're not yanked back  It's pure entertainment  Let's make it better  Sharks knowing  They're going to yank you back  Let's make it better Anthony  Let's say  Let's say  I hate rewrites  There's a slight flaw 
[01:25:00]  A rewrites  There's no risk  You can't share  A riskless  But there's no risk  On a rollercoaster  Really  It is a fucking risk  No  How fucking  Turn on the news  Odds are  How about one of those  Shitty wheel sticks  Well odds are  You'll be okay  For the amount of people  That go  How about gravity  Says fuck it for a day  Let's say  There's an occasional accident  I like that  I like that scenario  But it's not like  Everybody has to  Experience an element  Of danger in this 
[01:25:30]  I'm going to make it  Perfection  Okay  You only can go  Places  Where  You see  The fuck  You get sent  To the place  Where you can help  Stop something  No  That fucks history up  You might disappear  Yeah  If you fuck something up  With history  And then somebody lives  That would have died  And then that person  That would have died  Killed your father  Man fuck that butterfly  Freck shit man  If you stop murders  What's going to happen  If you stop this guy  From getting murdered  That  Oh he's the guy 
[01:26:00]  Who invented the  And then his grandson  Kills your father  His grandson  Oh  And then you just disappear  Alright  But then you were never there  To kill him  Alright fair enough  To make him live in the first place  You got this all planned out  I just like  He really got it planned out  He had a lot of shitty jobs  He had a lot of time  I just like it  As an amusement  It's an amusement park  Where you get to see  Actual history happen  And then you yank back  And you have the actual  Visceral feeling and memory  That stinks  Why don't you write a movie  How does it stink  It'd be great  Write a movie  I got a radio 
[01:26:30]  You know why you can't  Write a movie  I got a radio show  Why  There's no risk  Okay here's the risk  But that's what happens  Something happens  Something happens  With the machine  Or whatever the fuck  Something happens  Not so much with the machine  But something happens  Where somebody  Fucks up  And winds up  Saving somebody  Hold on  How do you fuck up  Anthony said the scenarios  I heard you earlier  You can't get involved  With the action  You cannot get involved  But see for the movie version  A guy can't help himself  Yeah  And he's on  Gets involved with some 
[01:27:00]  He's on the beach  Of Normandy  Oh you can't do nothing  You just have to stand there  Or you're supposed to stand  In one spot  And just absorb this up  Because that's your risk  You sign away  You're fucking right  If you step off  Of your spot  At Omaha Beach  And you catch a bullet  You're fucking  You know  That's your problem  But one guy  Gets involved  And that's where  The movie becomes  Really fucking good  Now the guy  See something happening  You fucked up everything  He sees some poor  Cowering guy  A German's ready  To fucking  Bayonet him  And he shoots him  And that guy  Was supposed to die  Because this and this  And this happened 
[01:27:30]  Because that guy died  Which is why  Time Cop  Was a great fucking film  I liked Time Cop  You didn't like Time Cop  I liked Time Cop  Somebody might not like it  Just like  People might not like it  Just because it's Van Damme  But that's a fucking  Excellent movie  Maybe they should rewrite it  I like Time Cop  I didn't mind the Van Damme movies  There's some action  There was some that was good  Time Cop and Hard Target  Were great  Hard Target was good  But you're  See  It's gotta be something else 
[01:28:00]  It was a fantasy of a tin knocker  Stapling together sheet metal  Okay  I'm not fucking Spielberg  It got him to 5 o'clock every day  It got me to punch out time  You're right  What about Time Bandits?  Time Bandits?  Nah  A little too weird  A little too weird  Any kind of time travel shit  I liked  12 Monkeys was great  I liked 12 Monkeys  That fucking movie was fantastic  That movie doesn't get enough credit  Any kind of time travel-y  Fucking paradox-y shit  That was that one  With fucking Bruce Willis  And he's in the future 
[01:28:30]  There was a plague  And they send him back  To try to get the pure form  Of the plague  So they send him back  Is that what 12 Monkeys was?  Yeah  You know I've never seen  12 fucking monkeys  That's what Brad said too  Yeah yeah  It seems a little  It bored me like  When it came on  Nah it's really good  I like 12 Monkeys  I heard 12 Monkeys is good  I just couldn't get  Give it another shot  I like it  Good movie  Let's take a break  We'll get into some other things  Yeah  We got a Santa Claus  That got fired  What did he do?  Touch a kid  A little joke  A little joke?  A little joke 
[01:29:00]  Of course  Would he pull it out?  Yeah he pretty much  Stuck his cock  Wipped it out  Stuck it  We'll find out next  We'll find out next  And yeah other things  We'll figure it out  The Opie and Anthony show  On the virus  Virus  Sirius XM  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll see you next time  We'll be right back. 
[01:29:30]  You're weeded out. 
[01:30:00]  Too bad we had to take a break.  That was some fine stuff right there.  That was fun.  Hey, we got Santa Claus being fired.  We should get right into the story.  Fire.  Fire.  Oh, look, the deliciousness.  Hold on.  Oh, fuck me.  Oh, God.  What flavor are you going with?  The smell of the cinnamon, sugar cinnamon pop tart is...  No, you'll smack it.  No, what?  No.  No, like, let me look at it.  Where's the frosting?  You don't need frosting.  I like the frosting.  It makes it too fucking sweet.  Isn't it crazy?  Oh. 
[01:30:30]  Why eat a pop...  Why eat a pop...  But it's warm.  That's like eating a cracker, a giant cracker.  No, it's warm.  It's kind of like...  You don't like pop tarts?  What's wrong with the frosting?  That's why I don't eat them no more.  How do you eat a pop tart with no frosting?  But good.  There's goodness inside.  Oh, it's nothing worse than being unhealthy.  You got to tell yourself that frostless pop tarts are delicious, you fucking liar.  Don't lie to people.  Look, I probably would like a little frosting on the motherfucker.  Jesus, you're trying to keep from having another fucking embolism. 
[01:31:00]  So you fucking...  You know, that's why I don't eat delicious.  Should I have diabetes?  Why don't you be honest with the people?  But it's better than eating...  Don't fail.  It's better than eating dry toast.  It's not.  Yes, it is.  It looks dry, but there's some shit in there.  Have some milk.  At least have some fucking milk.  I agree with Patrice on that.  You got to fucking get a little moisture in you with that.  It's stuck in your fucking throat.  There's just enough moisture in between.  He's right.  You need a little milk.  You should see.  I've never seen a pop tart with no icing on it.  I've never seen it.  You're a thing of a toaster strudel. 
[01:31:30]  I go no icing, too.  You're a thing of a toaster strudel.  You go no icing?  Yeah, I do.  Where do you find no icing pop tart?  It's not easy.  They don't have a lot of them.  You know why?  They don't have a lot of them.  Jesus, blueberry guy.  It's really not easy.  You fucking kick shows from Whole Foods.  They call it organic pop tarts.  It's not really pop tarts.  Health tarts.  They give it some name like that.  Flaxseed oil. 
[01:32:00]  Flaxseed oil.  Flax tarts.  Fucking ass.  I fucking hate eating healthy.  I don't enjoy it.  It's not enjoyable.  Not at all.  I want a Krispy Kreme donut right now.  Or some crumb cake.  Entenmann's crumb cake would rule right now.  Anything with an Entenmann's fucking label on it.  Fuck.  Anything with an Entenmann's label on it is fucking heaven.  Entenmann's is the greatest cake company I've ever lived.  How did they make a deal with the devil to just make the best cake ever? 
[01:32:30]  Do you bring junk food into your house, Patrice?  Like, that's my thing.  I keep it out of the house because I can't control myself.  I have a bag of no-salt-uts chips that, you know, with hummus and Paul Newman's no-salt-salsa.  No-salt-salsa.  So you're having this no-flavor fucking fest.  Just a festival of nothingness.  Sea salt, and I measure it, and you just put one squirt. 
[01:33:00]  You just put one giant piece of sea salt.  Sea salt.  One crystal.  Right where it is.  What a nightmare, right?  I'm reading sodium labels.  I'm reading fucking sugar.  You gotta eat healthy, though.  You really gotta eat healthy.  Well, yeah, because, you know, that fucking stupid diabetes, but it's like, you know, like  people say, you know, 40's the new 30.  No, it ain't.  40 is exactly what it is.  40.  Father time don't bullshit.  Nah.  Father time doesn't bullshit.  When you turn 40, your body, you can do whatever you fucking want. 
[01:33:30]  It starts the toboggan ride down the hill.  You've used up all that time dragging that toboggan up the hill with all your youth and strength  and energy, and now get on for the ride down.  And life is half over, and the half that is left is the shitty half.  Let's be honest with each other.  Somebody said, 40 to 80 is not a fucking picnic.  I just had a birthday, right?  I'm like, people are like, happy birthday.  I go, don't remind me.  Like, yeah, I turn 41.  I'm like, you know what? 
[01:34:00]  I'm already 42 right now.  Yeah, yeah.  You understand how fast life is going?  It goes faster once you get older.  It's just crazy.  I'm dying.  You're just dying.  You're rotting.  You're just like, yeah.  You know what I was thinking?  The other day, how long would it take?  Okay.  How many people would know you were dead?  Like, how long would it take for someone to be concerned that you were dead in days or  weeks or whatever, but without news? 
[01:34:30]  So, and then how many people, because I know for, I mean, if you died in your house by  yourself, you'll be dead forever before I go.  Like, without news, I would never know you were dead.  You wouldn't know.  Someone would have to say something.  My mother, maybe, after a while, and my girl.  That's it.  Yeah.  I'll be decomposed in my fucking house.  You'd be one of those fucking-  Oh, really?  They found them months later.  I would stink.  They would send it because my fucking Chinese neighbor would send somebody out from the  smell.  She would call the police because she's like, this fat nigga stinks. 
[01:35:00]  I love your obsession with Asian people.  I can't get enough of it.  I almost want to beg you to tell your Asian story again.  I won't do it to you.  That's right.  I won't do it to you.  Fucking Patrice.  It would just be-  Someone sent somebody upstairs.  It stink.  It stink up there.  But I'm just thinking like, that's what I think about now.  And then I enjoy, here's what I enjoy, not to be disgusting, but I'm just sharing.  I enjoy a good shit now. 
[01:35:30]  I've never cared.  I just enjoy a fulfilling, empty shit like that.  Like it got out and it's shaped like a colon.  You were full.  Now you're not.  Tapered at both ends.  I'm obsessed with taking a good shit now because I just-  That's where you end up.  I'm a fucking, just a curmudgeon.  No friends.  No fucking-  I'm happy about shit. 
[01:36:00]  I'm going to stop wearing those-  I'm worried about falling and not getting up.  You gotta need a life call.  I need a life call.  Jesus.  I don't know, man.  I hate the commercials where there's an old man and an old woman.  They're fucking, you know, at least in their 70s.  And they're doing their canoeing or something.  And they look at the camera and they're like, these are the best years of our lives. 
[01:36:30]  Fucking liars.  And you just look like you're so full of fucking shit, you diaper wear.  And it's for a diaper.  It's for fucking like bladder control shit.  And these are the best years of my life and I'm enjoying them.  Right.  It's like, fuck you.  You were at Woodstock, you idiot.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, how about when you were fucking splayed open in the backseat of a fucking, a rumble seat in a car just getting plowed by some-  Your dick was fucking by Fonzie.  When you had the greatest dick of all time.  Yeah, there's what you want. 
[01:37:00]  And the pussy was good.  Oh, and the pussy was tight.  Like a fucking, like a little neck clam.  Now you see these two old people?  Yeah.  We're looking at two old people sitting there getting dialysis or something.  Now let me ask you, if they're together forever, like meaning-  Who hates more?  Who hates who more, I mean.  If you're together forever, since you were young and good looking, does her face and his face look exactly like it does to us?  Oh, right, right, right.  Like how they just look like two old farts?  Because if you look at someone every day, you don't notice they're changing. 
[01:37:30]  Is she as ugly to him?  Or is that the same beautiful shit bag?  Or does she look like the same woman that was waiting for him when he got off the boat from Europe?  When he dipped her in Times Square and gave her a kiss?  With her rubber face?  And her fucking giant newborn fucking horse knuckles?  They look like newborn horse knees. 
[01:38:00]  Her big arthritic fucking knuckles.  Looks like thoroughbred fucking joints.  How come Father Time?  How come Father Time couldn't just do this?  Because you're going to be healthy, healthy, healthy, healthy, healthy, beautiful, then die.  It is pretty twisted.  You just go, you're going to die.  In 80 years, you're going to expire like a battery.  Done.  As opposed to regress.  What year do you think your body starts dying? 
[01:38:30]  It's the second you come out of the fucking world.  I don't know about that.  You're decomposing.  No, because having a son, I don't believe that anymore.  Because if he gets a cut or something, it heals within hours.  It's creepy.  So when does your body make that turn?  No, I would say instantly.  Instantly, through cell regeneration, you're using up your resources.  No, no, no.  I see what...  You're growing.  I know what he's trying to say.  No, I think you actually...  He's saying there's a...  You're being literal. 
[01:39:00]  Literal, okay.  He's saying, when do you start to regress?  Do you start...  40!  I would say 45.  I think there's...  I would say 40.  I think there's...  Do you see...  Anywhere between 40 and 40?  Do you see...  Do you see...  Hold on, hold on.  I think there's a...  When you're born, you're developing and...  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And maturing.  Meaning...  And then it's like...  There's got to be an age where the human being is perfect.  There's a click up.  It's a roller coaster.  It's perfectly made.  Everything is great.  The skin looks good. 
[01:39:30]  Your bone structure.  Your fucking muscles.  22 years old.  You think?  22 is a great age.  I wonder if there's a real answer to this.  The click up?  The flying down is 40.  30 is the...  Click, click.  Is that...  It's the click, click, click, click?  The peak at the top.  And you stand in.  You survey the greatness...  Of 30.  And then 40 is...  It's not...  It's fucking pee.  Because you've got to go to the bathroom four times a fucking night. 
[01:40:00]  Because the obvious shit is like your skin starts sagging a little bit.  The gray hair starts coming in.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what you see this?  Gotcha.  A little bit.  It's fucking...  It's 40.  Yeah, you got a little bit up front.  Right.  When did you just have to start going to get...  My touch-ups for television?  How old were you when things were happening bad up there?  Oh, God.  Well, the good thing was I had a nice, slow fucking thinning of my hair.  It was over the course of many...  And you had a thick mane, right?  I had crazy, afro-fucking hair. 
[01:40:30]  Dude, he...  But then I started noticing, like, all right, let's get a little thin.  And it went out without a hat the other night.  He's got a full head of hair now.  I see him on Joey Behar.  It's kind of quirky.  It's looking good, but...  It's kind of creepy.  Without the help of money and science...  Without $12,000?  Yes.  What, where...  Oh, I would be fucking well-received on the side.  I'd probably have a Phil Collins up front, and I'd have a George Costanza in the back.  How old are you, Danny?  I'll be 30 in a few weeks.  You'll be 30.  So you started going early. 
[01:41:00]  You know what?  It's been...  It's just been a slow decline.  A slow decline?  Yeah.  You know, you notice...  You notice...  You notice things are changing.  Like, you know, for me, I don't know, 10 years ago, like, I noticed, like, there's  a little something going on.  And it just...  What is that?  Now, how about your body?  Very slow.  Do you feel as good as you do when you was 20?  No, but that's my own fault, because I don't do anything.  I felt like things changed for me when I turned 30.  30 was a...  Yeah.  30 was changing?  I just felt like I couldn't, like, do a lot of the shit I used to do. 
[01:41:30]  That was the prime of my life, man.  Health-wise, 30...  From 30 to...  I think it was psychological, though.  45 was awful for me.  It was just a complete decline.  From 35 to 45, I would say awful, because I did not take care of...  Yeah, look at that.  Isn't that wonderful?  That's a shadow part of the hair, mind you, to the right.  That picture makes me sick.  Isn't it terrible?  Look at me.  I'm an emaciated...  Why are you fucking hate you in this picture?  Why are you emaciated?  Drugs?  You know what?  You look like your attitude now. 
[01:42:00]  Like, you don't look...  I think...  Oh, you are perfect.  If you look like that, and you were you, I would never come in here.  You are perfect.  That is exactly it.  I act like I look like that.  You're a fucking piece of gunk.  Just a piece of shit.  I fucking hate your guts.  I know.  Yeah.  I don't fucking fault you in the least, Patrice.  You know what I got on right there, WB?  It would be a graffiti sweatshirt.  Oh, wow.  Look at the picture of Bob Buckman drawn on the bottom.  Wow, look at that.  Look, Ralph Titora. 
[01:42:30]  I fucking hate you in this picture.  Yeah, that was...  Right now, you look like a man who...  Like, your ideas seem to be well-formed, and I can respect them.  I tried.  This piece of shit.  You're not allowed to have an opinion.  You fucking piece of garbage.  That shit.  Did he look like that when you worked together, Obi?  I was at the 10...  Yeah, for the most part.  I was at the tail end of looking like that.  I bet Anthony had a massive afro.  Fucking massive.  Tail end of looking like that when we got the job in Boston.  Wild.  Wild motherfucking hair. 
[01:43:00]  That was it.  Put it in a ponytail for my tail.  Were you a wild red guy, Vin?  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  Yeah, that's what's so weird about it.  I craved knowledge and cocaine.  I would just go la, la, la, la at this person that had any knowledge.  I would go, go fuck yourself.  I swear, I used to cut lines on encyclopedias.  That was the duality of me.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  I fucking hate that picture.  Oh, that is every white trash Long Island motherfucker right there. 
[01:43:30]  I was a dime a dozen walking around on Long Island.  A lot of guys like that.  I can't believe that picture.  Yeah, and that's sick.  That's right.  Yeah.  I weighed 130 pounds.  Just a sickly man.  Little thin fucking.  Long arms.  Long gangly arms.  Big fucking afro head.  How old were you there?  That bad, my first, it was like fucking play school's my first mustache.  That looked 20s.  How old were you?  I was about 22, 23 there.  And you was 22 in that picture?  Yeah, probably.  You were dying early. 
[01:44:00]  I wasn't taking very good care of myself.  You was in decline, man.  I wasn't taking very good care of myself.  Fuck me, you were haggard.  Yeah.  Let me see this.  That was a while ago.  I can't believe that picture.  You were 22 in that picture?  22, at the most 23, but yeah.  Just wanting to be in a fucking accession band?  I'm going to fucking be, I was going to be the rock star.  What was your dreams?  What was your dreams in there?  Rock star.  Dreams?  I was fucking rock star.  Rock star mode.  I was lead singer of Rotgut, motherfucker.  I was going to take over the world.  What do you think that guy is doing now? 
[01:44:30]  I mean, who is that guy?  That is a wax image of fucking, you dumb fucks.  That's a bad wax Bob Hope.  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yes, it is.  That's in some kind of a wax museum.  It doesn't look like Bob Hope.  Of course, it was a shitty wax museum.  But I see where his wax now.  It's like on the road to fucking Zanzibar or some shit.  Wow.  Look at you, man.  Yeah.  You make me sick.  That's terrible.  You know what?  Terrible.  Fucking five packs of Marlboro Reds a day. 
[01:45:00]  So you're way better than that.  Now, what would you, if you could go back to that guy, what would you tell him?  One thing you would just tell him.  After I pinned him down and shaved his fucking head, I would tell him, knock it off.  You're not cool.  You look like an idiot.  Straighten up and fly right.  No, to help you from letting that person become the one you are now.  You mean idealistically?  You just go back and you fucking help.  But no, no, no. 
[01:45:30]  Because that person, that person fucking shaped what you are.  Right.  Even though you like what you are.  But would, there would be no advice you could give him?  I would give advice.  I would say, quit smoking and watch your cholesterol.  That's about it.  It would be health.  That's pretty much what I would say right there.  Because I'm going to tell you, if you watch your cholesterol, you're going to be fucking so many young bitches.  You're going to love that shit.  And exercise.  Don't wait until you're fucking 45 to start exercising, motherfucker. 
[01:46:00]  Unbelievable.  All right, listen, we got the Santa that got fired.  Oh, yeah, some people are really.  And no matter what you do, never marry a bitch named Jennifer.  Oh, yeah, you forgot that part.  I don't care what you're thinking when you're fucking.  I don't care how it feels.  I don't care what anyone says.  Don't ever marry her.  Fuck. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, you forgot the obvious.  Yeah.  And then I'd give him a picture of my house right now and go, now, listen to my advice in here.  Just take that witch.  It's going to be like old Biff telling young Biff in the car.  Yeah.  Listen to me, butthead.  Butthead.  Take this book.  He's driving my Mustang.  Get out of my Mustang, you.  You know how to start my car.  That's Back to the Future.  Yeah.  That's fucking Young Biff and Old Biff. 
[01:47:00]  I guess you haven't listened to the show in a while.  Take it out of your sight.  Always keep this on you here like this.  Oh, that was the gambling book.  Yeah, with the fucking.  I've seen it, but I can't call from that fucking movie.  The sports almanac he gives them.  And fucking luckiest man in the world at the track with his picture.  Damn.  Young Ant takes one of the poker chips back with him.  He sees it change as something happened in the future.  See me with a giant check at the fucking Borgata.  Hey, here I am. 
[01:47:30]  Fuck me, man.  Ah, shit, yeah.  We really are fucking preoccupied, though, with the whole time thing.  Yeah, because I'm just like shit.  We're constantly.  I mean, just as human beings, we really are.  Some more than others, but I even think the ones that come across like they're not are.  When I hear 62-year-old people died, I go, oh, man.  You start doing some math.  At 20, you go, what difference does it make?  You're ready to die anyway, you old piece of shit. 
[01:48:00]  Now I'm like, oh, no.  I used to think how long it would take.  Like, and I'm talking when I was probably when I was like 10 years old, I would think how long it was going to be until I was 40.  And it's like, oh, my God.  And I would sit there going like, I have to go through like 1970.  One, two, three, four, five.  And these are all years.  God, I know how long a year is.  And I'm counting it off like that.  And it's like, God, that'll be forever.  And then all of a sudden you're there.  This is the most fucked up thing about age. 
[01:48:30]  You don't change.  You just get older.  You think you do.  At 20, right, you're just young and delicious.  But at 40, at 40, you're not, there's guys in high school I still hate with the same passion.  Like, you would think you get mature and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, you'd think something changes.  But you fucking, you are the same person you was at 20.  Except for now you're fucking 40. 
[01:49:00]  Yes.  You got the same likes and dislikes.  And a few little incidental things change.  Like, oh, I like Brussels sprouts now.  But other than that, you're the same motherfucker.  Your laugh doesn't change.  Like, you don't start laughing like, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, jocularity, jocularity.  You don't become a man.  Like, I still look at men and then go, fuck, he's a man. 
[01:49:30]  I'm 40, I want somebody to praise me when I fill my gas tank.  Like, if I fill my gas tank, I go, somebody should just, why don't nobody just say how responsible I am?  Look at you with a full gas tank.  You've made it, Patrice O'Neal.  Fucking, when am I going to feel like a man?  I just paid my bills this month.  You never will.  Someone fucking say, cool.  Say, wow, look at you.  You never will.  Well, our own Greg Opie Hughes had to have Steve Blatter, our boss, tell him to pull his pants up the other day. 
[01:50:00]  Because his sweats were falling down under his ass.  You're obsessed with that.  It was probably one of the funniest things I've ever seen in these halls.  Is Steve Blatter going to Opie.  As Opie's like walking around and talking to him.  He goes, and he's talking to him, and then Steve just looks down and goes, and he was serious.  He goes, pull up your pants.  I'm still a fucking...  Like, because Opie had the sweatpants on with the elastic is just gone.  You've got chastised.  There's nothing worse.  I'm still livid about it, by the way. 
[01:50:30]  The elastic's been gone since fucking 1996.  I tried to dress comfortable.  What did you do?  They were falling down.  I don't know why.  No.  What did you do when he said...  He pulled his pants up.  I pulled my pants up and then said, how dare you?  How dare you?  I'm still pissed off.  I bet.  He took you by surprise is what happened.  And trust me, how my brain works, I will get him back.  He took you by surprise.  I will get him back.  He was.  He was right.  What vengeance are you going to get?  You're not a thug.  You're not a kid. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, my underpants were showing.  I'm like, what am I doing?  His underpants are hanging out, and the top of his sweats looked like they'd been burnt  in the dryer.  They were cracking.  Like, they were crackled, and the elastic's gone, and it was hanging down his ass.  And Steve just goes, he...  Fucking Blatter.  What would you fucking do if they gave you guys a goddamn dress code?  I'm out.  Yeah, that would be rough.  It's...  That...  No.  Suit and tie.  How could they do that?  Coming to do your fucking...  How could they do that?  Pretty much one more thing they forced us to do, I'm out anyway. 
[01:51:30]  Pull your fucking mask off.  Pulling up your pants.  One more thing, I'm out anyway.  So, fucking make it a good one.  I've had it.  I have had it.  I wish I'd seen that.  I might have been on the floor laughing.  You know what would be great?  Uniforms.  If they don't have a dress code, they have...  You know what?  They actually have uniforms where we have to wear, like, fucking, like the Dharma Initiative  jumpsuits.  I'll give you another part of that equation.  I will guarantee that Blatter is younger than me.  Oh, yeah.  And he's telling me to pull my pants up.  Oh, he's absolutely younger than you.  It just bugs you, doesn't it? 
[01:52:00]  Yes, it does.  All of our bosses, I think, are younger than us.  And he was dead serious.  Oh, yeah, he was.  And then you would have looked like an asshole if you said no.  No.  Because you should have pulled your fucking pants up.  Pulled my pants up?  You know why?  There's probably some kind of thing where if your fucking underwear is shown in the hallway,  something could happen.  That could be a problem.  Yeah.  I'm sure it wasn't.  He was, you know, concerned about your dress code.  Yeah.  Who knows?  But whatever it was, he told you to pull your pants up.  I'm still fixing.  My butt cheek was sort of showing because, like, the string was around my hip, but the 
[01:52:30]  material was gone on the right side.  It was, yeah.  It looked like, so when you, when he said, when he said, I feel the same way, Patricia.  When he said, pull your pants up, did you go okay?  I was.  Did you go?  I think it took him by surprise.  What did you say?  You just pulled him up and the conversation ensued?  He reverted back to being a kid being told to pull his pants up.  And just did it without thinking about it.  And he stayed there and watched you fucking put, like, what happened? 
[01:53:00]  It's going to be tough for me to say this, but I knew I was.  Yeah.  Doing the Fonzie thing.  I knew I was wrong.  Yeah.  So I felt partially humiliated.  Did you say thanks?  No, I didn't say thanks.  What?  I was partially humiliated.  I was partially humiliated and really pissed off inside.  I want to know what you fucking, wait a minute.  Okay.  I was humiliated.  Anthony, tell me to pull my pants up.  I'm just trying to see what would happen.  Just, just, pull your pants up.  Oh, shit. 
[01:53:30]  I, like, I don't, say it again.  Like, wait a minute.  Like, wait a minute.  So, uh.  Wait, let's talk for a second.  Yeah, we got that thing Friday.  Yeah, because we were talking about the Paul McCartney show, weren't we?  Up there at Foxwoods.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  Poker and shit with a lot of the listeners.  And pull your pants up.  And that's how he said it, too.  Ooh.  What the fuck did you say?  Ooh.  Like, ooh. 
[01:54:00]  Did I say anything?  I think I would have been like, why are my pants bothering you?  Did I say anything?  I don't even know.  I don't think you did.  I was humiliated.  I started laughing hysterical.  You silently fixed your pants in front of this guy?  Another man who's younger than me.  A younger guy.  A younger guy had to tell me to pull my pants off.  Silently fixed your fucking shitty pants?  Fucking pulled his pants off.  And continued with the conversation?  Or did the guy walk away?  I think they started, they kept talking, but I was laughing so hard, I lost track.  But how did he know my pants were down?  Why was my shirt up? 
[01:54:30]  They were so fucking, your shirt, that's just it, didn't even have to be up.  Your pants were so falling down.  And like you said, the rip on the side, a whole ass cheek, Opie looked like he had been  dragged by a vehicle in those pants.  He called Opie a disgrace.  Yes, he did.  You're a goddamn disgrace.  Pull up those pants.  Straighten that hat.  For the first time in a long time.  What the fuck do you say?  For the first time in a long time, I had nothing to say. 
[01:55:00]  Usually I'll always have something to say.  And for God's sake, get that XM pin off your lapel.  I don't know how I would fix my pants seriously.  Right, seriously.  But just fix your pants.  Pull your pants up.  And I seriously fixed my pants.  He couldn't believe he was saying it.  Everyone was in disbelief.  I'm like, he's telling me to pull my pants up.  Did he give like a half loud, Jesus Christ.  It was the tone of voice.  The tone of voice was disgust. 
[01:55:30]  It was, pull your pants up.  Pull your pants up.  You in there?  Oh yeah, I started rolling.  I was laughing my balls off.  What did he say?  He pulled his pants up.  You just watched him fix his pants?  Yes.  And that's what fucked me up.  No, it fucked me up.  That's why I'm still talking about it.  So Anthony, man, so this thing on Friday, we're going to do this thing on Friday.  Okay, so you're definitely going to be there.  What time are you going to be there, man?  Leaving after the show, probably about one.  Hey, fix your pants.  Put your pants up.  Really? 
[01:56:00]  Right?  That's what I'm saying.  Like, this should have been awkwardness from Opie to him.  Like, when you go, really?  And then it's the onus on me to go, yeah.  I swear I had nothing.  How the fuck is it just that simple?  I had nothing.  Pull your fucking pants up and then nothing. 
[01:56:30]  Like, that really was enough.  I was mortified and humiliated that he had to say that to me.  And then I realized, fuck, he's right.  Are you ever wearing those sweats back to work?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think I'm the only guy that wears sweatpants around here.  And we were discussing...  But it's because it's way more comfortable to come in this way.  We were discussing what we were going to wear to the Paul McCartney show.  Oh, is that what that was about?  At the time.  So it kind of made everyone conscious of what we were wearing at the time.  Because Jimmy and Ed decided to go all in.  Because me and Jimmy were talking about we wanted to wear suits. 
[01:57:00]  I didn't go in suits.  So I was like, I want to wear a suit.  You want a suit, too?  Yeah, and Jimmy, we were talking about wearing an open collar.  And then I decided, like, after I got all that on, it's like, all I got to do is put a tie on.  I might as well do that.  So I did that.  And then we were talking about...  Opie was like, you know, I'm not wearing a fucking suit.  No, I have one suit that I wear at weddings.  And like I said the other day, they're on to me and I got to buy another suit now.  So that's when Steve gave Opie, like, the up and down.  Because we were talking about clothing.  Okay.  And then he gave Opie the up and down and went like, pull up your pants. 
[01:57:30]  Maybe Steve's half a fag.  Like, holy shit.  He fucking...  He was disgusted with Opie's lack of caring about dress.  Oh, you think that was it?  Yeah, yeah.  He was already...  He just got disgusted with your basic dress attitude.  With the Paul McCartney show?  That you weren't going to wear something nice to the show.  Like Norton and him talking about suits.  I'm not going to continue the bit.  I looked nice for the show.  I just didn't wear a suit.  No, exactly.  It had nothing to do with looking nice.  No, no, no.  It's the conversation prior. 
[01:58:00]  I'm just not a suit guy.  No, the conversation...  Yeah, yeah, I understand.  He's just disgusted.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to make it make sense for me.  I've been toiling over this, Patrice, since it happened.  I don't think I've ever been told that.  I've been...  Except for, like, my mother.  But she's never even said that shit.  When you're a little kid leaving for the school bus and your mother has to go like, pull  your pants up.  And you're like, oh, I forgot.  I'm glad we're making light of this because I've been fucking furious ever since.  Have you been furious?  Yes.  Because that's how my dumb brain works.  You know what he should have done?  My brain is ridiculous.  He should have fucking licked his thumb and cleaned something out of the corner of your 
[01:58:30]  eye, too.  You fucking mess.  Come here.  Come here.  You're a mess.  He's rubbing the side of his face.  You got something.  Come here.  You know what?  Really was a great response.  Because it goes back to me.  Really?  Really?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Pull your pants up.  Because it does put the onus on you to say, really?  Come on, man.  Can we say it again?  Another man, probably easily seven years younger than me, had to tell me to pull my pants 
[01:59:00]  up.  Yeah.  That is fucked up.  And he will pay for that.  What was your instinct?  It might take a year, but he'll pay for that.  He pulled his pants up.  Like, my instinct would have been like, what the fuck do you give a fuck?  Why don't you fuck off?  Fuck out of here.  Why don't you pay attention to me like that?  That wouldn't be the ordinary response to it.  Take a generic.  No, I gave him the open, though.  Like Ant said, they were way down for whatever reason.  They were way the fuck down. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, but I'm going to make an excuse for you.  The fact is, you...  And then I had the 511 underpants that we got from those guys.  Things are great.  But you wasn't...  Where they're fucking tight to the body.  It wasn't malicious.  Your pants weren't maliciously down.  No.  No, not really.  You would just live in your life at that moment.  He had pants like Tom Hanks in Castaway.  You don't throw your shit away.  That was intrusive.  That's some intrusive shit.  It really is.  But to say it with such disgust...  You know what?  My clothes are getting fucking old.  You're right. 
[02:00:00]  You gotta go shopping.  Oh, he's gonna come in here with a fucking mock turtleneck tomorrow.  I'll tell you what happened.  And pants that fit.  I was ready for new clothes and then I had a kid.  Oh, so it all just...  Not to make no excuse, but...  Why, does he shit on your clothes?  What a clue.  Well, that, yeah, but...  Why does a kid make you fucking not pull your pants off?  Harder to get out there right now.  You probably don't even want to go shopping.  A little harder to get out there.  Fair enough.  I mean, I should still get my ass to a fucking clothing store.  I get it.  I definitely should, but...  I mean, there is Zappos.  Made it a little harder.  While you're sitting there changing diapers, go to Zappos, motherfucker, and get yourself 
[02:00:30]  some fucking sweatpants that fit.  By the way, today wearing sweatpants.  Yeah, just to show his shitty rebellion, it's over, motherfucker.  No, this is...  You pulled your pants up.  Don't come in.  Don't come in showing us what...  It's over.  Motherfucker, I'm gonna show some of my pubic hair now.  You pulled them up.  Pull your fucking pants up, you mess.  You treated you like fucking Arlie Hermey, motherfucker. 
[02:01:00]  You are a disgusting fat body.  Pull your goddamn pants up.  Who the fucking pile?  I know he realized as he was saying it, he couldn't believe he was saying it.  And there was disgust.  I bet he did believe it, because he's a boss.  He's audacious.  When you wake up at 4.30...  What have we got here, a fucking comedian?  When you wake up at 4.30 in the morning, nothing feels better than putting on fucking sweatpants  to go to work.  Well, Steve, I've had these pants for a while, and they're a bit ragged. 
[02:01:30]  Well, no shit.  That is...  And you know, it's just so weird.  All right.  It's so weird.  The people...  Believe me, it's been on my mind...  Hold on, hold on.  ...since I saw it.  Drew in Jersey.  Drew, go ahead.  Oh, what's up, man?  All pull your pants up aside.  What grown man actually wears sweatpants with their junk all flapping around?  My junk wasn't flapping around.  Are you puff-tenting and shit?  Are you wearing proper undergarments so you don't have your dick? 
[02:02:00]  And how was he dressed?  Typical corporate?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a corporate douche.  Sorry, Steve Blatter, but...  Steve dresses like, um...  Like a corporate guy.  No, not really.  It's weird.  Radio slash corporate guy.  What, hip?  Hip?  Hip?  Corporate noir?  No, what's his name?  Fake hip.  Who made Nightmare Before Christmas?  Corporate hip.  Corporate hip.  I know what corporate hip is.  Like Tim Burton.  No tie.  He dresses like a Tim Burton character. 
[02:02:30]  He's always in black, and it's like...  It's like a suit, but not quite...  How's the hair?  Is he groomed?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's always very well groomed and everything.  I would have felt...  I would have...  I would have cursed him the fuck out, I think.  Like, hey man, I'm fucking...  I don't know...  One more time.  Can we do this one more time?  So, uh...  Who do you want?  I wanna...  Do you wanna be the guy that needs his pants pulled up, or do you want me to be the guy?  I want you to pull your pants up.  All right.  Because I just... 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  What's the...  So, hey man, are you excited about this Paul McCartney thing?  Uh, we had a blast.  There were a lot of celebrities there.  What's it like listening to them?  Like, without the other two...  It didn't matter, because Paul McCartney writing and, uh...  Because he actually does sing...  He's the guy, so he's the voice.  Slow down.  You're fucking up the scenario that was before the Paul McCartney show.  No, this is just normal.  Oh.  We just make it up...  So, it's like, you know, you're hearing his voice, and he's the guy that wrote the song,  so the backup band...  Not taking away from the Beatles, obviously, but hearing him sing his songs and his voice, 
[02:03:30]  it doesn't matter.  What was he...  How was he dressed?  Yeah, he was dressed kind of casually.  He looks good.  He wasn't jumping around the stage.  Was he looking old?  No, not as old as I thought in pictures.  Jesus, man.  Pull your pants up.  Should I?  Where the fuck do you get that?  And you pulled your fucking pants up? 
[02:04:00]  What the...  I don't even...  Wait, wait, I'm sorry, Evan.  I fell.  I fell.  Put your pants up.  What's your next fucking move?  There's no move.  Yeah, yeah.  And then wait.  We're talking...  And then you pull him up...  I instantly grabbed for him to pull him up.  And then we continue?  Yeah, so I was saying, he sounded great.  Mm-hmm.  Looked good.  Now my pants are up because you told me to.  So now I'm subservient.  And I'm just looking at you like you're just a...  Yeah.  You're lesser now. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  In some way, it makes you lesser.  It didn't...  Now, hey, do this with your eyebrows.  Fucking dusty eyebrow.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me get off the eyebrow.  I got some smudge on my...  Some schmutz on my cheek.  Weren't you raised right?  Yeah, what happened?  Like, that's where it goes.  It's like you...  Your jacket doesn't go with your shirt either.  Look into that.  Who wears those kind of socks?  Yeah, what are you wearing?  Argyle socks?  You can do the scenario another hundred times, and I know it just is not good for me.  It's fucking hysterical. 
[02:05:00]  Where is it?  It's just...  I'm so sorry.  I can't wrap my mind around that.  There's no way to change gears from a conversation to someone telling an adult to pull their pants up.  There's no way to...  You can't mentally handle that quickly enough.  Especially...  I think if Opie was malicious, and you go, pull your pants up, Opie could have laughed.  Oh, that would have been...  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry, man.  I'm just...  I'm a mess.  Pull my pants up.  But if he's just generally... 
[02:05:30]  Patrice, in that split second, I thought of a million things, or none of them made sense.  I was fucking done.  Checkmate.  I had nothing.  Check and mates.  I had nothing left.  Oh, my brain was like...  Going through the Rolodex.  You can't be a fool and go, fuck you, I'm not pulling my pants up.  But you go, there's some kind of cost that he has to pay for saying, pull your fucking pants up.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:06:00]  At that time, though, you can't get revenge later.  You know what you should have done?  That's my expertise.  You know what you should have done?  Gone to Steve and gone, Steve, the jerk store called, and they're all out of you.  Jerk store!  I'm so glad Anthony keeps bringing this up.  Thank you.  I love it.  That is fucking shocking to me.  I'm so sorry, man.  I shouldn't be such a baby about it, but...  No, it's... 
[02:06:30]  That is shocking to me, man.  There's something so analytical.  Like, to sit there and analyze it.  There's so much there in such a simple one little moment.  How are you getting up to the Foxwoods, man?  They send a car.  They're going to...  Okay, cool, man.  But that's not through here.  That's through my own deal.  Like, everything I'm getting is pretty much through my own deal.  Is it really?  I told Sirius, like, don't worry.  I got my shit.  Take care of it.  So, Keith, make sure all phone calls are made.  All inquiries are made.  I don't even know what to...  Put your pants up.  Oh, shit. 
[02:07:00]  I'll see you try it again.  And instantly, I look down, like, there's nothing I could say to you.  I'm going to fucking say that to somebody that's...  And see what they do.  That's a good idea.  What a great social experiment.  See what they do.  Are you going to the thing, Roddy?  No.  Why not?  I'm fucking going.  Why am I going if you're not fucking going?  I got to buy some sweatpants.  Are you fucking serious?  Are you going?  Yeah, a lot of guys are going.  Who's going?  Who else is going?  I think everyone but Obie is going. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, I'm just passing on this one.  Is Bobby going?  No.  I heard something, but I think it's working.  Of all?  Anybody?  Jimmy.  Jimmy will be there.  Patrice will be there.  Ant's going to be there.  It's going to be...  Honestly, it's going to be a great time.  And I might, at the last minute, try to get up there.  But I was just passing on this one.  I might as well talk about it.  It's at Foxwoods Resort Casino.  It's the Anthony Cummings of Texas Hold'em Extravaganza.  This Friday, December 17th.  Play poker with us.  A bunch of the staffers.  Patrice, Jimmy. 
[02:08:00]  Now, what's the payoff is that you're in this tournament?  The payoff is you can make money.  Some money and shit.  Plus, it's just a good time.  And then, believe me, the shit that goes on.  I don't know what's going on.  It's Wednesday.  I have no clue what's going on.  I don't.  There's no organization.  I will make sure.  Excuse me.  Make sure Patrice O'Neal knows everything that's going on.  And he needs transportation.  Don't worry about how people are dressed.  And make sure you take care of Patrice O'Neal.  Oh, good.  That's nice.  I like that. 
[02:08:30]  I just don't want to say that.  Kenny got pissed when he heard some stings.  Oh, shit.  He got fucking salty when he heard a couple of things.  He'll do that.  Because, for real, I mean, no offense to the series.  I like coming up here with you guys.  But I'm like, I'm not an employee.  And they're paying me snack money.  Like, this is for snacks to come, you know, to fucking come up there.  You know what it is?  You hang out.  You just fucking laugh your balls off at the idiots.  I saw some alligator Chuck Taylors on this website. 
[02:09:00]  In my size, motherfucker.  That I can't get.  I just can't even pay for my fucking alligator skin Chuck Taylors, man.  Holy shit.  And, Patrice, now you know why I'm not going.  I see.  Okay.  See, that's Anthony's thing.  He loves being at casinos.  I mean, if I'm going to go to.  It's just fun to do that.  If they were sending me to a nuclear power plant.  And, by the way, in fairness to them, I didn't ask.  They just wouldn't.  No, we kind of wanted to hang out. 
[02:09:30]  Patrice is a lot of fun to sit there and laugh at the dealers at Blackjack and shit like that.  I would have fucking, you know, went.  So, I just want to make sure it's not like you didn't.  But, if you're going to, it's like, don't fucking start treating me like a fucking employee, motherfucker.  No, no, no, no.  Believe me, no.  You, uh, be treated first class.  That's what you're getting.  Invoices.  Fuck that.  Fucking invoice for what?  For this?  I'm considering this like I'm going to the casino and, coincidentally enough, Sirius is holding a poker tournament that I will play in. 
[02:10:00]  Was this a, um.  That's pretty much how I consider it.  That's exactly right.  Was this a Anthony, Sirius, uh, production?  Uh.  Did they come to you?  You come to them?  Well, in the past, we have, uh, had, uh, we almost had a poker tournament.  Uh, we were taken off the air for the, um, uh, homeless guy that talked about the first lady and shit.  Yeah.  But, uh, uh, it sold out really quickly and people said we ought to do another poker thing. 
[02:10:30]  Well, years later, they finally decided they would.  We have a good relationship with Foxwoods because of me and, uh, Keith the cop.  Um, we know a lot of the people up there.  They take very good care of us.  Those tribe people are cool, right?  I take very good care of them.  Yeah.  It's fucking great.  They're all black, too.  Are you getting along with them?  I never, I only see white people.  They only put them up front.  They send the white people to you.  Yeah, they send the white people all around up front.  When I did fucking comics, it was all the Negroes.  It was the, it was the people that were an eighth.  Oh, eighth.  Oh, eighth.  Yeah.  An eighth. 
[02:11:00]  I'm an Indian motherfucker.  Yeah, let me tell you.  It was fun.  I'm from the Sioux Nation.  So you meet some white Indians and shit?  No, they're just white guys that work for the Indians.  Oh, so we got the special treatment.  But you don't want to see the Negroes.  No, I don't, it doesn't bother me one way or the other.  You know who I don't want to see?  Asian dealers.  That's who I don't want to see.  With the personalities of fucking fly people.  The machines.  They're machines. 
[02:11:30]  Fucking third world abuse motherfuckers.  Take my money.  Why would a casino hire them?  You want a dealer with a personality.  If no, you don't.  Because they win.  When I do gamble, I want a fucking dealer with a personality.  If you open a store.  I like that shit.  Who are you going to hire?  If you have things that, there's only two people in the world that care about their job  more than their own life, and that's Asians and fucking Hindus who will die.  If you own a cigarette store, a Hindu will fucking die protecting your cigarettes. 
[02:12:00]  Defending that.  Yeah.  You're so right.  So fuck, you know how robbed your store would be if I worked there?  Two gangsters with fucking guns and a Hindu will fucking jump over the counter.  With a half of a mop stick.  Yes.  Yes.  Just poking and fucking dying.  And some Asian lady, she's not going to steal.  Every 30 seconds she does the I don't have nothing hand fucking thing.  I hate that move. 
[02:12:30]  Fucking stupid.  I'm not holding anything.  With no attitude.  Because like, look, white people, black people, they do it in this.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I ain't got nothing like fucking dick.  I know it's a technicality.  Like we all know we have to do this for this guy.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Asian, I don't have nothing here.  I don't have this.  Not only that, but more importantly for a casino, the Asian dealers very rarely carry on conversations  with you.  Conversations.  So more hands get played, more hands get played, more money the house makes. 
[02:13:00]  Bam.  Got you.  Because they just want to get them cards out.  Keep it coming, Hop Singh.  Fuck you.  Keep the cards coming.  They might as well just get a robot to do it then.  At that point.  They have one.  You can't call them.  It's called fucking Cynthia Kim from fucking Hartford, Connecticut.  And her husband, who owns the fucking, she works there at night and go fucking runs  the dry cleaners at the daytime and the nail shop and she comes and she doesn't give you  any personality.  How do they ever get fucked?  How do these people, why are the least personality people in the world the most, why do they fuck 
[02:13:30]  the most?  Where is all this fucking unfun cum coming from and non-enjoyable eggs getting together  to have billions of these fucking nonsensical, unfun, cheap human beings who don't even fucking  consider stealing because it's dishonorable. 
[02:14:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Fucking selling you bad fish?  Fucking really dog eaters?  Yankee cranky.  You ruined communicating with Asians for me.  That's the worst.  I can't even go to a Chinese restaurant without thinking of Patrice and his take on this whole  thing.  And it's like, really, you want to be upset Asians?  Prove me differently.  I have an Asian dry cleaner, Asian laundry person, Asian fish tank cleaner, the guy fish 
[02:14:30]  and I've known all of them, all of them.  The only one that's, that's worse is this black security guard out here who doesn't give  you a frequent flyer.  I come here probably enough for you to not treat me.  Really?  I got to sign the book too.  I really, you're going to put the clip on my fucking Patrice O'Neill sticker that I  like, you got to clip it on so we know who you are.  Treat me like I've been here before, man.  I agree.  So the Asian dry cleaner, there's no frequent flyer. 
[02:15:00]  There's no thing, free shirt after fucking, okay.  If the, if the bill is a $1.99, he goes, I only charge you $1.98.  It's okay.  Yeah.  It's okay.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I use my own battery to put in your, I give you $300 a month to  clean my fish tank, cocksucker.  Can you please?  So I asked him, cause he left and he, and he's, and he's passive aggressive. 
[02:15:30]  Is this a new story?  Oh, he goes, I go, why the fuck?  I go, I've, I've had fish for seven years.  Why, when I say something about the fish that I think my fish, there's something wrong  with that fish.  You go, you laugh at me as if I'm a foolish Negro.  Holy shit.  You think that not having fish for seven years, 365 days, fuck the seven years, 365 days a  year for seven years that I don't know a little bit about fucking my fish. 
[02:16:00]  This fish isn't growing.  So I go, why the fuck do you do that all the time?  Why are you passive aggressive?  It's like, it's like, I, he, he, and he speaks to me like I'm stupid, right?  I go, I go, this fish isn't growing.  Well, um, I have to say, like, look, motherfucker, why let me, and then I go, by the way, why is 
[02:16:30]  it that your people are so grossly unfair and evil to us?  Wow.  Guess what I found out?  What?  We've become closer now.  Blacks and Asians?  That we are bad luck to them like cats.  Well, it's some ancient shit?  Yes.  It has something to do with feng shui.  Can you look that up, Danny?  A black guy's like a couch face in the wrong way?  What the fuck are you talking about?  Dude, he's a traditional Asian guy, and he said, we're, we seem, we're like ghosts. 
[02:17:00]  There's no term for like nigger or black guy or whatever.  They call us black ghosts.  We're, we're not real to them.  And that's ancient shit.  That's what he told me.  Wow.  And then I warmed up.  I go, are you serious?  And I go, why are you so fucking cheap?  Where does that come from?  What do you say to that?  Well, he goes, he goes, well, it's all ancient shit.  Yeah.  You know, when we came up and I'm holding hair, and when you have money, you, and it's like, 
[02:17:30]  ugh, it's like, it's an ancient shit.  The best part of the story, you continue to use him.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he does a great job, right?  He does!  And that's, that's.  I had a Russian lady dry cleaner who was magnificent human being.  I come, there's baby shit on my fucking pants.  I don't have a baby.  Why is there baby shit on my pants? 
[02:18:00]  She's like, oh, tootly tootly toot, tootly toot.  If you see a Russian diner, like a fucking waitress, some shitty madge or flow, you'll never get your food right.  Oh, these eggs is running, honey.  A Chinese person, eggs done perfectly.  And that's your deliver.  You're not going to get.  This Asian dry cleaner is magnificent.  You went right back to it, right?  Magnificent dry cleaner.  I search for other dry cleaners. 
[02:18:30]  Not going to fucking happen.  I go to a Spanish lady.  Clothes are shitty.  Can you crease my fucking shirt?  The arms of my shirt, I like them to be creased up.  That would be 30 more suns.  You go, you can't do that shit.  The fucking dry cleaner.  Okay, boom.  It's $4.92.  That's what it is.  $4.92.  And it's perfectly fucking done.  And now he tries because my attitude is so poor and I spend so much money. 
[02:19:00]  Now he tries to be friendly and it's painful.  I come and he goes, hello, O'Neal.  My name is Patrice, you fucking piece of shit.  Hello, O'Neal.  Have a good day.  Because that's what he thinks.  He thinks Americans sing when they fucking...  Black ghost.  Just give me my fucking clothes.  Hello, O'Neal.  Cock sucker.  Just be what... 
[02:19:30]  I'm used to you being what you fucking are.  Oh, fuck.  You personality-less motherfucker.  Treat me like shit.  And once again, nothing for free.  God damn.  Ever.  This cock sucker, I'm telling you, he's just like,  Oh, I put my own battery in this machine that you purchased from me for $150.  So you should have done that.  I'm like, do you think you're giving me a break?  Oh, yeah, I did not.  It cost $4 and I did not charge you. 
[02:20:00]  And I think I told you for this, that I said...  I just told my girl, go upstairs and get that change.  Give me $4 and quarters.  Yeah, and quarters.  Yeah, yeah.  He cupped his hand.  Made sure he got every fucking...  He cupped his hand and took that fucking change.  I ought to slap some change out of a motherfucker.  Give change.  Give some change to a black toll booth worker.  Y'all go, just go through for free.  I don't be giving me no motherfucking change in my hand, bitch.  When they're off, they got to count that shit. 
[02:20:30]  It's like, fuck you.  Old black lady called me a bitch.  You don't be giving me no motherfucking rolled up pennies, bitch.  Chinese toll booth worker.  One, two, three.  There's only 97 pennies.  It's a dollar.  You have to go around to the front and get a waiver.  For three cents.  Fucking cheap motherfucker.  Holy shit.  Sometimes, I give...  If a motherfucker, right? 
[02:21:00]  If the bill is $9.67, right?  Or $9.82.  And the motherfuckers...  I give him a 20 and he give me all this change.  I put it...  I give him the change.  I go, that's not for you.  That's for the next person.  That's short a nickel.  Right, right.  You understand?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're off a fucking nickel.  You cheap motherfucker.  China has a better economy than us.  Why the fuck would you be so cheap? 
[02:21:30]  That's why they got a better economy.  Because it was...  No, because that just started.  And won't give you any regular visitor love.  I had the perfect restaurant in Jersey City.  I won't go no more.  Because these pieces of shit.  I go, I'm the guy that comes in every other day.  I know.  Oh yeah, I know.  O'Neal.  Yes, but we cannot...  Like, how can you tell me you cannot extend something to me 
[02:22:00]  that makes me feel better than the average dick face  that comes to you once a week?  It's a regular business.  I come every other day, you motherfucker!  Yeah, that's like a fucking...  A good business move.  Good will.  They don't know.  Good will for good customers.  Wait, but the fucking fish guy,  he don't like Chinese.  What is he?  Because they are like him.  What is he?  He's Chinese.  What?  He don't like Chinese?  He don't like Chinese people. 
[02:22:30]  Because they treat him like...  Because they are not...  They are socially inept and they're not...  You are!  Everyone is saying that you sound like Marvin the Martian.  That's how this fucker talks.  That's how he's cleaning your fish tank.  Good old Marvin.  I'm telling you, I'm not exaggerating.  It's shocking, man.  And I don't want to dislike...  But when you try to be nice, it just ain't happening.  It just won't fuck...  They don't know how to be nice. 
[02:23:00]  They don't.  They don't know how to go, sorry.  This is what they should say when they answer the phone.  Hello, something something walk.  I don't speak very good English,  so please have patience with me.  As opposed to me having patience with you,  because you're speaking the language that we speak in this fucking...  Please don't be frustrated with me  because I don't speak English that well.  Yeah, yeah.  That would be nice.  But no.  It's like, what?  Yeah.  Can I have some rice with no onions?  What? 
[02:23:30]  I'm busy!  And they don't care about...  They're cheap,  but they don't care about losing you as a customer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is shock.  Like, I'm not coming back.  So what?  Good.  But here's a dime.  I love on the phone trying to get them fucking...  I was like, yeah, order for delivery.  Yeah, 18 Maple Lane.  18 Naval Lane? 
[02:24:00]  No.  Maple, like the tree.  Maple Tree Lane?  No, no.  It's...  It's...  It's 1-8 Maple.  Maple.  Pour what?  Pour your pour?  You know what?  You want the spring roll?  Oh!  It's so frustrating.  And you think...  And this is the thing that people...  They might be Asians,  and then, like, some fucking...  The Asian fucking alderman down there might get mad.  But prove it to be wrong. 
[02:24:30]  Not yet.  Your people are egregiously horrible.  It's so difficult.  Prove this to be wrong.  Why do you think there's a fight in the house whenever you're ordering Chinese food as to who is going to place the order?  That phone gets passed around.  Could you please do it?  I don't have the fucking patience today.  It's like, I don't have the patience.  And it's like, I need an order for delivery.  Could I have two egg rolls? 
[02:25:00]  I need beef and broccoli.  The chicken teriyaki.  Don't forget.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good.  We should do it right now.  Small large.  Small.  Okay.  Address?  Phone number?  Don't forget.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  917.  Yeah, 9917.  Did you get the 917?  Yeah, 9917.  917.  917?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Frustrated and shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:25:30]  100 times.  Yeah, they're frustrated.  Why are you frustrated?  They're frustrated with your perfect English.  Yeah, why are you frustrated?  Every time I hang that phone up, I announce to everyone in the house, I go, we are never getting this.  I go, we are never getting this.  There is going to be an Asian guy driving around.  And I'm going to have to fuck.  And I always tell him, I go, it's a house.  It's got plenty of Christmas lights on it.  There's an escalator in the driveway.  I'll fucking put both headlights on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got escalator.  I got fucking runway lights on my roof that are spinning beacons. 
[02:26:00]  Whatever it takes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Beacons.  Hey, shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's exciting.  It's just shocking, man.  No, I don't want bacon.  I said beacons.  And this ain't no fucking, this ain't no bit.  No, no.  This shit ain't no fucking, oh, stereotype.  No.  That's how you fucking prove me wrong.  Prove me wrong.  I got a story I was just reminded of. 
[02:26:30]  There was a wedding and my wife needed a dress, right?  And it had to be taken in and all that shit.  And it was like a day, maybe two days before the wedding and the dress comes back and it's  not right.  It doesn't fit right.  It looks horrible.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wah, wah, wah.  So my girl is getting upset like, holy shit, the wedding's tomorrow.  You fucked up my dress.  And she's getting upset and all of a sudden the lady goes, oh, Rindsey, you cry like baby. 
[02:27:00]  I forgot about this until just now.  Oh, Rindsey.  Like, like, can't understand why she's upset.  You cry like baby.  Like, the wedding is literally the next day or maybe two days, maybe.  And the dress is not even close to fitting.  Oh, Rindsey.  Like, it got all fucked up because it was her fault.  Confucius saying, right.  The woman cry like baby.  And that's how she comforted.  She was trying to comfort her by saying that.  Yeah, that's a way to comfort. 
[02:27:30]  That's a way to comfort.  It's like, no, bitch, it's your fucking fault.  Holy shit.  Oh, that is great.  I forgot what we did.  I think we had to go to another place and they got it fixed in time.  But what?  This is absolutely.  And because I say this, look, I do not.  If people don't.  If people have dealt with enough.  Anybody.  Like, I don't.  I don't defend people who deal with black people and they deal with the worst black people.  Right.  And I go, look, how many times do you have to deal with with a particular group on a situ in 
[02:28:00]  a situation before you're allowed to go?  I don't like them.  Yeah.  So if a person.  I don't.  I don't scream like, oh, you're a racist so fast because, look, I tip a lot, but I know  there's black people that don't understand tipping and tipping.  So when they see me, I can understand why they go.  Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  Not knowing that I've been with Patrice.  Patrice is a big fucking tipper.  I don't fuck around with people. 
[02:28:30]  I know money makes motherfuckers jump.  I'm telling you, you give a motherfucker a twenty dollar bill goes fucking eons, man.  It is.  They remember.  They treat you nice.  These these these these garage people, I give them a five every time I park.  Just a five in your hand.  And I apologize if I give him four because that mother five is said something to ten is  like, yeah, motherfucker, we're going to make sure we put your shit where there's no 
[02:29:00]  rats, you know, make sure nothing happens.  But but but fucking when you dealing with a person and you go, oh, my God, I'm living  a stereotype.  Yeah, I'm living a stereotype.  I'm living these Asians, man.  They're not nice.  When how long before I have to go find the nice one?  I don't want to.  Let me tell you what happened.  Something about tipping, though, the other night at the world famous Apollo Theater. 
[02:29:30]  I was just I saw you tweet.  You're an asshole, man.  You're just a pure asshole.  I don't understand.  My two.  I wonder how many felons.  Oh, you're just awful, man.  With the history of the Apollo.  And by the way, real quick, I'm going to say that you tweeted something about Don Meredith.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And I fucking laugh for four hours straight.  What was it?  I missed that one.  I don't want to say it because it's just I don't know.  You know, whatever.  Dude, it was a Don Meredith thing.  I was in pain. 
[02:30:00]  Go search back when that Jets game was going on.  I was in the Apollo Theater seeing the wonderful Paul McCartney.  And there's a little bar in the back like that.  Getting a beer or two.  There was a lot of white people at the Apollo that night.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was all white.  The only black people like Chris Rock was the only one, I think.  Why did they do that?  Was it a special engagement?  Only special people were there.  Yeah, invitation.  Well, now there's a lot of people upset that there were a lot of celebrities there and not enough subscribers.  That's the new fucking thing.  Who the fuck?  It's Paul McCartney.  That's the people out there bitching about. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  There were a lot of fucking celebrities, man.  Like real celebrities, not our fucking caliber.  Real fucking guys.  That was one of them.  Wait a minute.  So it was at the Apollo.  Yeah.  Where were all the cars parked in there?  Apollo?  How many people were there?  The whole thing was filled?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that was fucking packed.  Where was the parking in?  Where was it up there?  They had buses that were bringing the white people from the subway station two blocks to the Apollo 
[02:31:00]  so they wouldn't have to walk the two blocks through the Serengeti.  Do you understand why no one likes you people?  They had it all figured out.  After the show.  I can't get protection.  Have you ever watched a zebra walking from a nigga stealing my truck from his front of  my house?  Have you ever watched a zebra walk from the water hole back to the woods?  After the show they had buses that took people to the west side and the east side.  That was it.  Back downtown.  Buses.  They had it all figured out.  Buses.  I grabbed the town car.  No one walked out the streets of Harlem. 
[02:31:30]  Second I walked out, a town car stopped.  A town car guy stopped.  I pointed at him.  He goes, yep, yep.  And we got in.  And then we're thinking, like, how many events at the Apollo do you think black car, town  car drivers are actually stopping going, hey, could I give you a lift?  They are, but they're livery cabs with the town.  But that's just it.  That's why you find them slumped over the wheel.  Those poor motherfuckers.  What the fuck?  Are you serious?  They did that for the...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  They did that.  Wow.  Listen, I'm being told we really got a break.  Wait, I just want to go two seconds, though, with this. 
[02:32:00]  So I'm at the bar.  I grab a couple of beers.  And it's free.  Free bar.  Okay.  So I had a 20 in my hand because I was going to pay for drinks.  I didn't know it was free.  So actually, I think it was Mel came by and said, it's free.  Oh, really?  So I'm like, oh.  Yeah, food, too, and everything?  I just drinks at the bar.  Okay.  So I'm like, fuck it.  I got the 20 in my hand.  And I go, that's for you, to the bartender, the girl behind the bar.  Now, she's a sort of rotund black woman.  Big old honey chow.  Big fingernails.  The big painted up precious. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So no thank you.  No thank you.  I'll tell you why after you've done that.  I just fucking, I didn't even care.  I'm just like, I got my beer.  I got my drink.  I got, you know, a couple other people's drinks.  Whatever.  Walked away.  I come back before Paul McCartney's going to start.  She's pouring a wine for somebody.  So she gives the guy the wine.  I come up.  And I go, could I have another beer?  She goes, you can't get any more now.  We're closed until, you know, later or something. 
[02:33:00]  But I gave you that 20, baby.  And all I'm thinking is like, look, I'm probably the only motherfucker that tipped you.  And I gave her a 20.  And she can't crack a beer open and fill my fucking cup up after, and right after she gave a guy a glass of wine.  You are just, let me tell you.  Please.  Black people are very sensitive about context.  Context.  20 dollars, sweetie.  You know, no disrespect.  Here's a 20.  But 20.  Here, fat niggaleen. 
[02:33:30]  Take this 20.  And you will be giving me my beers all day at my request.  You fat fuck.  She smelled it on you.  So she said, take your 20 and shove it up your ass.  Cracker devil.  Niggaleen.  Exactly.  I can't believe it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Patrice can put shit in perspective.  With that, we got to take a break.  Patrice, you promoting anything?  Not a thing.  I'm retiring right now.  Big mama prods on Twitter.  That's what I promote for Patrice. 
[02:34:00]  Start following his ass.  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hello, O'Neal.  Hello, O'Neal.  What's up, niggaleens?  We're back.  Niggaleens.  Niggaleens.  I learned a new word.  That's funny. 
[02:34:30]  That's Anthony's name.  That's Anthony's name.  No, no.  I actually learned a new thing that happens in the black community.  I don't know if you're going to get mad or not.  What?  What is itis about?  It's niggaitis.  What is that?  Eating and falling directly asleep.  We've claimed that.  Jesus Christ.  As if white people don't do it.  But they just say itis.  Yeah, because it's niggas.  No niggas.  You know, they cut the nigga out.  Itis.  It's the itis.  They just say itis. 
[02:35:00]  They got the itis.  Got the itis.  Usually after eating.  They got the itis.  Get the itis.  I'm getting the itis.  Did not know that.  Itis.  White people with their lack of charm and wit.  I'm getting sleepy after a meal.  Yes.  Fucking just say something.  I believe the tryptophan has made me a bit drowsy.  Say something sexy, you fucking corny, stiff white people.  Yeah, but black people's impression of white people is lame, too.  We don't talk like that.  Well, I...  Really?  You don't talk like that?  Let me tell you the way I talk, Buster.  Yeah.  Let me tell you, Buster. 
[02:35:30]  But again, if you...  To understand black people is to understand context.  Exactly.  It's all context.  If you figure out context, you better deal with it.  I understand now.  We know you don't talk like this, but that this is an attitude.  It's just...  Yeah, it's not a literal...  I'm better than you.  It's not a literal speech thing.  It's an attitude.  It's an attitude.  It's like this, motherfucker.  Mm-hmm.  That whole fucking...  It's an attitude.  It's fucking...  It's why we both do that.  White people fought hard to get the word nigger removed, because they didn't know how 
[02:36:00]  to do it.  They didn't want to learn the way to say it and do it.  Yeah.  And have fun with it, because it's a very fun word.  And it should be a word...  You do seem to have a lot of...  Nigger.  Gosh, a lot of fun with it.  I call everybody nigger.  I call women nigger, man.  Yeah.  White people.  I don't...  Because I think that to be a great...  I like it better than chief.  It's just like...  Or sports.  It really is just like a, hey, you, or hey, what's up, hey, pal. 
[02:36:30]  It's just a made-up word.  It can be used to be made up for anything it needs to be.  Yeah.  But that girl, that $20, you gave it to her with pretense, and she smelled it on you.  But it was a pretense that I would give any white person.  Yeah.  See?  But that doesn't matter.  But it should.  Well, stop...  See, that's...  Stop always going to white people if it's acceptable for you, pieces of shit.  Especially coming from a guy that looked the way you looked at 22. 
[02:37:00]  How dare you?  I don't think she saw that picture.  You didn't find out tips until you fucking got your third paycheck from this radio company.  Piece of shit.  And you're worth millions.  My mother tends to buy.  And you gave her a 20, and you wanted this girl to do fucking monkey flips for you.  She should never have done monkey flips.  Shine your shoes, boss!  But pouring me a beer after she poured one guy a wine just because it's one second later  than she's supposed to pour it all the time. 
[02:37:30]  And she was showing that she can be white efficient and go by the rules.  I'm telling you, it's your fault.  You created us.  We didn't know all this shit coming from Africa.  You know what happens?  When we're fucked up, we're copying you.  When I go to fucking O'Malley's, and I fucking wave down the bartender, and he's like,  what, you want a fucking Guinness?  And I'm like, thank you, sir.  And I hand him a 20.  Anytime I go to the bar and just put one little finger up, oh, fucking O'Reilly's right back 
[02:38:00]  down my end of the bar.  He doesn't have a history of foulness dealing with you.  The potato famine cut into their whole history, friend.  Put it this way, the potato famine.  I mean, if there was a bunch of people there just going, here's a buck potato, you piece  of shit, you piece of shit, you dirty potato guy.  It's that 20.  She looks at it like, you think you bought me for the rest of the night?  Patrice.  Fuck you, white man.  Hold on.  Can I jump in for a second?  I'm just saying that's what she thought. 
[02:38:30]  I understand.  Why didn't Nigga Lean go, I don't need your fucking 20, and give it back to Anthony then?  Because she has a job.  She's not fucking crazy.  She's just, here's what it is.  Hold on, but if she knew what that was all about, then her pride should have said, you  know what, fuck you and fuck your 20.  What she did, look it, I take great stock in understanding one white thing, and that  is passive aggression.  I study it, I watch for it, I live by it. 
[02:39:00]  Do you think I was being passive aggressive, doing what I did?  No, I don't know what you did.  I didn't see you.  But I'm just saying, for her, and it could have been her not recognize you either, there's  a, no crackers coming, Apollo?  You look like every other cop-faced motherfucker that was there too.  So we don't even really need to get all anthropological about it.  It's like, you're just somebody.  She might not even recognize your 20, and recognize you.  Is there, was there something I could have done, a different amount of money, a different 
[02:39:30]  approach?  How would I have been able to approach her and have maybe gotten my beer?  You'd be the charming guy you were to make sure she knew that you were different from  every other piece of shit cracker.  That's just throwing money at her and you go, sweetie, how much is it, how's this work?  Because I'm going to take care, you've been so wonderful.  And she would look you in the face and go, that's my nigga right there.  And when you come, it's like, is it okay to, she fucking sips, give you beer, give you  charm, use your natural charm that you will use for one of these fucking white ladies here 
[02:40:00]  with plastic surgery.  Just fucking, just kiss her on the fucking cheek.  Hey, precious.  Hey, precious.  Here's a coupon where you can go get your nails done, and I know this great weave place  by my house, I can have my car pick you up.  It's like, be special.  You treat her nice and she treats you nice.  I just threw money at her.  You threw money and expected things, yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Well, we got Dr. X on the line from Mexico.  Dr. X.  I don't get it, but Jesus, what's next? 
[02:40:30]  First, you guys take the Christ at Christmas.  Now you take the nigga out of the nigga-itis.  What the fuck?  He should be embarrassed.  Yeah, I think he is.  I think he hung up.  I think he hung up very embarrassed.  And that's why I like, you know, I like people to fucking do respect what you guys do every  day.  It's like, you have to be entertaining for fucking five hours, four hours.  It's like, this guy had one thing that his whole life, and he sounded like a dick.  And he just sounded like an asshole. 
[02:41:00]  But it's just like an asshole.  But that's what I'm saying.  And, you know, that tip thing.  I understand that.  Yeah.  But you don't have to always be coddling.  But in that situation, the Apollo Theater just, and she probably, dude, it's just, and  I'm not saying it's right.  But you know what?  It just is.  I'm trying to explain.  I actually had no preconceived notions.  I wasn't trying to be.  You wasn't being malicious, right?  I wasn't being malicious.  I wasn't saying here, oh, this poor downtrodden sweetie, let me give her a 20 so I could come 
[02:41:30]  back and go.  But that's what a lot of black people think.  That's how I operate.  And no matter what bar I'm at, I will tip the fuck out of the bartender the second I  walk in, just out of greed.  There's some black strippers you can offend.  Really?  There's some black strippers you can offend.  Get the fuck out of here.  Have you ever offended a stripper?  I've offended where you, this thing.  Not by giving them money.  How'd you offend her?  You can offend us.  Russians will take anything.  Like if you, you know, maybe ball up your five. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, I've seen it.  And flick it.  Yes.  And, you know, making it rain.  Money delivery system.  Making rain is you're dealing with probably thousands.  So making it rain on a bitch is like, oh, that dignity is, uh, that's my dignity falling  down on my head.  But if you got a buck and you're trying to roll it up into the shape of a cigar and stick  it in an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's like, guy, you know, it depends where you are though, man. 
[02:42:30]  That's a big tip for that.  True that.  At some places.  I've given a stripper, I've given a stripper a hundred just for making away around the bar  because she was fucking like amazing, beautiful.  But Anthony, tell the truth.  You gave her that hundred with the idea there was a, there was a context behind that fucking  hundred.  Oh, I wanted to come back over when she was done with her dance and have a little chit chat  and she gives you the rub at the bar and you fucking can put your arm around her and  you buy her a drink and then, and then you know what? 
[02:43:00]  It's just like having a date only you fucking pick up and leave whenever the fuck you want.  But an Irish bartender, see the thing, if you, if you don't have any, any background racial  hangups, I think Italians racial hangups were, were gone in the, in the, in the, in the,  in the early hundreds.  The cement laying period.  Yes.  Once you.  The great empire state building building period.  Once you started to become white people, it stopped.  Yeah.  And I think, I just think, you know, that's the only thing. 
[02:43:30]  Black people can't become white people.  I think if we could fucking, looking at Obama, he could just be.  You can just become Americans though.  You really can at this point.  We are Americans.  I think at this point though, you could become just Americans.  We fucking love this country though.  Not African Americans, but just Americans.  I really think at this point you guys are, you don't, you don't get to be Italian American?  I don't want to be.  I could give a shit.  So say that speech to everybody.  I could give a shit.  Because everybody does that horse shit.  Oh, I do.  And I will.  I will.  I don't give a shit if a TV show wants to portray Italians as fucking cement layers or gangsters 
[02:44:00]  or fucking rapists.  I could give a shit.  It doesn't matter to me because I was born here.  Generations of my family were born here.  And I think black people too.  It's just, it's gotten to the point where it would be a lot easier to just be American.  I would say the frustration for us.  Yeah.  I'm not speaking for it, but.  I know.  I think you're the representative in here.  Black people feel like Sylvester Stallone felt at the end of First Blood.  Okay.  Okay.  That speech that he gave. 
[02:44:30]  It just, we want to love this country, but white people make it difficult by how you treat us.  We get it though.  Yes.  Cause you treat us like dogs, but I think you do.  You treat us, here's how you treat us.  You treat us like good boy.  Like here's the one thing.  I'm going to tell you what white people do.  What liberals do that?  Not fucking like.  And I, and I mean, I've, I've had extensive, I live in Boston.  I've said this many times.  I've dealt with racism. 
[02:45:00]  The, the, a non overt, a subversive racism.  White people in general would have less problem with us.  If we just, if we are, we, we, we are less, um, arrogant.  They don't like arrogant niggas, man.  So they, here's what they want us to be either appreciative.  Like, thank you for master for feeding me.  And if you elevate yourself to what you seem to be famous or rich, you go, thank you master for letting me attain such wealth and greatness. 
[02:45:30]  But you want to be appreciated for your benevolence.  But how to be treated, but then how, because we're not doing that.  And we are, I'm not representing white people.  I'm not saying that.  Uh, then what's the option there?  It's why you like Michael Vick now.  It's why you like Mike Tyson now.  It's, it's why any former arrogant, it's why you like Muhammad Ali now, any former arrogant nigger who is now contrite and in his place is well loved. 
[02:46:00]  Tyson gets all kind of movies and shit now because he, they forgave him.  Floyd Mayweather, as soon as something bad happens to Floyd Mayweather Jr.  And he's going, I'm sorry, Michael Vick.  But see, I'm watching Michael Vick.  Are you keeping your eye on him?  Yeah.  Michael Vick.  I'm appreciative. 
[02:46:30]  Thank you.  Michael Vick, the new, uh, white quarterback, Michael Vick, the new doing well, Michael Vick, the new dunking after he scores, Michael.  He stopped all that shit.  That celebratory nigger shit.  And now he's going, man, fuck his.  He's getting his swagger back.  He forgot that white people hated him.  So he's getting, he's getting the itch to go strangle some dogs.  He's getting, he's getting the itch. 
[02:47:00]  He's feeling like, I can't do wrong again.  Where are my dogs at?  Where are my motherfuckers?  It's time to go to the dog.  Time for me to drown a dog up in this motherfucker.  You can see his interviews.  Time to go to the shelter and shit.  His interviews are changing from when he, when he's, thank you.  So I'm so happy to be here to like, I don't know.  I might stay with the Eagles.  Right.  I'm looking at my options.  I might go back to Atlanta.  I don't like that cracker playing for Atlanta.  I'm telling you, if you're like a, white people love contrite, apologetic in their place, black people. 
[02:47:30]  And why should we be in any place?  That's what kills, it's just, it is, white arrogance is, is, is the issue.  And, and, and that situation you did with that girl, you, you just think back.  Think, step outside your body.  And you expected that girl to say how high, when you say jump, once you gave her that, that giant 20, not out of, not out of context of her job.  I never expect anything more than her job. 
[02:48:00]  Uh, I do like when I, I tip a bartender, it does give them a little more incentive to get over to me a little faster.  Cause I don't like standing in a crowd waiting for a fucking drink.  Let's put it this way.  Hookers don't like to be said.  All right, prostitute, start taking my dick down your throat, you dirty, you see how porn stars act when they come in?  They go, can you, they want to be treated like ladies.  Hey, you fucking dirty stink hooker.  Who fucked you in your ass today?  Like they go, you piece of shit. 
[02:48:30]  It's the most frustrating thing that we deal with, knowing what they do for a living.  You're absolutely right.  And once again, him fucking summarizing it like we were talking about in the bathroom.  I was just saying, Patrice is a student of society.  Society of all types, white, black, Asian, you have, uh, uh, used your, your life and your wisdom to study all people.  And see how they behave.  It is amazing to me.  And if you get a hooker, you should be able to say what you just said.  If you pay for pussy, when she walks in the door, when I've ever gotten a hooker, I've been very girlfriend-y with her. 
[02:49:00]  Like, hey, you need some of a drink?  I should be able to go, all right, stop peeling them down, you filthy animal.  I'm paying for your stinking.  Hey, hey, let me see that piss hole right now.  Fuck, dirty, stinking.  Your mother must be disgusted with you, you piece of shit.  I'm paying for pussy, you fucking whore.  But you go, hey, how you doing?  You want her to feel good?  And you feel good, and, but you should be able to treat her like dog shit. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, but she's not going to like that.  Yeah, but so it's in the context of...  Regardless of the job, but...  It makes a good point.  He did it in the context of the job.  That's what he does.  But here's what...  She probably misrepresented him because of where she comes out.  But here's what, yes, but that's what I'm saying.  White people do not, black people look at white people and, and try to understand the situation.  White people, because you, you hover above us with a, with this attitude of you, we're  better.  You don't ever really try to understand our shit. 
[02:50:00]  Well, you know what it is?  And it's hard for me, too, because when I walk into a bar and there's a girl behind the  bar and I do the same thing, drop her a 20, pay for the drink first, and then just give  her a 20 immediately.  And she'll, she'll look and be like, oh, thank you.  Like, really, she'll be, thank you so much.  $20 tip is some dope ass shit.  And that's just the beginning, because as the night goes on, I don't think I've ever  gotten a drink and not left the change on the bar and shit.  And that's after tipping. 
[02:50:30]  Like, I want to, I will take fucking care of a bartender.  You weren't wrong, but I'm telling you why that happened.  But she should understand the job she's in.  Why doesn't she understand her job?  Fuck you, motherfucker.  Yeah, why?  She, she understands her job.  But that's the type of shit.  First of all...  Hold on, hold on.  When you're a bartender, that's the type of shit that does go on.  And you should understand that.  But you're going to have guys that are tipping a little more...  She's a bartender at the Apollo Theater.  First of all, she lives off of her salary. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Because a place like Apollo probably pays like it's a job.  And because you're not going to, you're not counting on tips.  They probably had a sword fight to see who worked this event.  But it's not like she can change, they didn't give her any training at the fucking thing.  Now you're going to be tipped.  Because she has a...  This is the act of people giving you money for service.  She has a black boss.  Yeah.  It's the thing, when I walk into a McDonald's, if I look around for a white boss, when I  see black girls at the thing, and black kids, and I see a white boss, I go, this is 
[02:51:30]  going to be a good McDonald's.  If you see a black, all blacks, and then some Mexicans, and some...  It's chances it's going to be a shitty McDonald's experience.  How could you have a shitty McDonald's experience?  Can you explain that?  You can.  Explain that.  Huffing and puffing.  I don't have patience with huffing anymore.  Hands on hips.  If you're not ready to order, I don't give a fuck where...  Sometimes you just want to...  You're looking. 
[02:52:00]  And if you're not ready to order, there's a...  I have to grab you, because you'll go and start talking to your friend at the Apple  Pies, because you went for this slow motherfucker.  The Apple Pies.  I hate slow motherfuckers.  Damn, it's the same menu.  It's like a...  It really is.  It's like a Sinbad bit.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like...  But I'm telling you, that's why, look, I'll say there are some things...  Look, white people should get treated better in some situations. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, just because they're white.  But black people, if I walk in a sneaker store, they should treat me like royalty.  Because you are...  And treat you like shit.  Buying.  You're buying.  And you're buying top of the line.  You know what you're buying.  This black girl's getting ready to buy a pair of purple Adidas, because it matches the scarf  she bought.  White people take up your whole time finding out how the gel and the ASICs work.  Is this going to be good on my treadmill?  Yeah, and then you don't buy. 
[02:53:00]  You cheap.  And you suck.  But they still treat you with fucking respect.  But in a restaurant, white people should get treated like gods.  At the sneaker store, they should roll out the red carpet for me, nigga.  Because I'm walking in that bitch going, give me the three new Jordans and give me that  t-shirt right there, nigga.  Let's go.  Yeah.  And that happens all day.  We don't go in sneaker stores and fuck around.  White people do that. 
[02:53:30]  But we go in restaurants with $60 and order $58 worth of shit.  It is what it is.  And just give grief to the waiter.  Just give grief for everything that comes by.  You're a sneaker guy where you wear it once or twice to sneakers, right?  Yeah.  I remember having that conversation with you.  That is just insane to me that you would wear sneakers just once or twice, man.  Motherfuckers should know my pedigree at the shoes.  And where do the sneakers go after you wear them once or twice? 
[02:54:00]  They go.  They don't go.  They just be in my closet.  I go, wow.  I should stop buying so many sneakers.  Are you being serious?  I'm being dead serious.  How many times do you really wear a pair of sneakers?  Right now, the ones I have on, these have become somehow my favorite sneakers.  I don't know why.  Okay.  But I have a lot of, there's a pair, I'm telling you, there's a pair of alligator skin Chuck  Tailors I got my eye on, man.  When I buy them, I'll probably wear them once, but I have them.  I just have them, motherfucker.  I just don't get it. 
[02:54:30]  Just to have them.  I have some alligator skin Chuck Tailors, bitch.  It just is what it is.  Real alligator.  A dead animal.  Gotta be real alligator sneaker.  There's a dead, there's an exotic creature.  What do those look like, Danny?  Let me check those out.  There's some alligator skin Chuck Tailors.  You know, only certain people can pull that off.  Patrice is one of them.  I don't think I can pull off the alligator sneaker.  Liking the jacket you got on today.  I'm trying to keep my swagger, but having a...  Got a black, almost leather jacket on today.  Having a girlfriend makes you forget swagger sometimes, you know? 
[02:55:00]  Does it?  Yeah, sometimes.  There you go.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  Those are fucking alligator.  Black alligator.  Black alligator.  And those look like fucking hornback.  Those are some bad motherfuckers.  Those are dinosaur sneakers.  Those are bad motherfuckers.  And no one would notice.  You would never notice.  But if you walk by a bitch who check you up, up and down, she's going to like...  This nigga got on alligators.  And the new shit, don't wear diamonds in your watch. 
[02:55:30]  Like if a motherfucker know, like all the rich, rich rappers now, they're going to like...  What's that?  It's just a normal watch.  Million dollars.  Really?  You know, don't wear...  Don't wear no shiny shit.  You know, it'd be...  You know, you go, wait a minute.  Is that a 12-carat diamond pinky nail?  Like this nigga just...  Like it's very...  Like those...  A little more subdued.  Those fucking sneakers are probably...  They look like somebody's trying to sell them because they call them custom and convert. 
[02:56:00]  Those look about a G, maybe?  Howdy?  Well, these are custom.  These are custom.  Oh, now it's 400.  This guy will make them for you.  Oh.  Custom.  What?  What's this?  Custom alligator converse.  What's going on here?  Make them for you.  He makes them for you.  That's crazy.  Can you give me that website before we go?  Yeah, of course.  What do you mean?  It's only 400 bucks?  That's cheap for some fucking gators.  She's making a deal right now.  Walking around with the gators.  Hey, baby, how you doing? 
[02:56:30]  Holy shit.  She look down at your sneakers, man, and she know her shit.  Yeah.  Same thing with women.  You look down at them, and she's like, oh, she's got some nice shoes.  That bitch is all right, nigga.  They pay less, but she's working them.  Details, man.  It's context.  So, look, I'm in perfect agreement that there's places where...  But, again, not to go back to the Chinese people thing, but I'm saying, why would you  treat black people poorly, and we are the only... 
[02:57:00]  The real core customers.  We're the only customers you have at the bulletproof Chinese restaurant.  At the bulletproof Chinese place.  Right, right.  But here's the thing that we don't have a history of doing.  We don't have a history of truly saying, fuck you.  Only one time in history do we...  Is the busing thing.  Is Rosa Parks, and then we said, fuck it.  Bus boycott.  After that, we don't have a history of going, you going to treat us like this?  Fuck you.  And it means something.  Like, we really go, hey, everybody, listen, I don't want to protest, but this Asian person, 
[02:57:30]  really, everybody walk in and see how this person treats you.  You should stop buying from here, just because they treat you like shit.  Well, you know why?  And then walk away.  Technically, ever since the Rosa Parks stuff and the civil rights of the 60s and early  70s, the laws themselves have been changed.  Like, you used to be allowed to say, no blacks at this counter.  Right.  Motherfucker, no blacks at this counter.  The laws, technically, and literally, were changed so that it allows that. 
[02:58:00]  So there was no real...  Here's the heart that you're dealing with, though.  The heart from us.  Yes, you can't say no blacks here, but say you own a restaurant, you can't say there's  no blacks allowed, but really, in there, there's no blacks allowed.  Right, right.  In your heart.  That's what I mean.  Now you're dealing with personal things.  Now you can't prove it.  Now it's a race to prove racism.  And now white people, what they do is they wait for someone to fuck up racially. 
[02:58:30]  And then they lamb-base that person and make him the one.  The sacrificial lamb.  He's the one.  He's the guy.  Now that he's gone, racism's gone.  This makes things better.  That's, you know, so that ultimately, it is a heart thing because we have to love this  country to not have burned it down.  But, well...  We should be insurgents.  Seriously.  We should be motherfuckers that just are coming out every five minutes. 
[02:59:00]  You don't know if we're going to blow ourself up in a diner.  There's a portion of black society that is very similar to that.  Who?  The Israelites, nigga?  No, no, no.  Not to the extremes of terrorism, but just to the extremes of really tying up the system  in ways financially, prison systems, fucking convenience store robberies.  Can I see one white guy under that fucking mask?  Can I say Bernie Madoff is the one guy who has been, you know, dealt with by this white 
[02:59:30]  collar crime?  Yeah.  But I'm going to tell you, man, when it's mostly blacks and mostly Latinos selling little  vials of crack.  When you can get 25 years for little vials of crack, and those are the people who are  selling it, but I'm saying there's ways to, and I'm not making excuses for motherfuckers  who's out there doing crime.  I'm talking violent crime. 
[03:00:00]  I'm talking violent crime.  What do you think?  There's no white people in jail for violent crime?  No, I never said that.  There's some mean motherfuckers.  Believe me, I watch Lock Up.  It's the scariest place on earth.  Do you see some of these fucking Aryan brotherhood motherfuckers?  And don't forget that we are in a metropolitan, this is how we live, is exactly like fucking  Braveheart.  There's the major, there's the major Mel Gibson place, but then you got to run through the 
[03:00:30]  rest of the country.  You're running through the mountains to get the Skagoolga clan to join you in society.  There's the tree's running.  Rocky Mountains.  Iowa.  And I've been to those places, and cosmopolitan white people, there's only about five cities 
[03:01:00]  in this country, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., which is not really  a city, Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, San Francisco, and Vegas, Nevada, and only because Vegas is 
[03:01:30]  in it.  Now, I'm going to offend a couple of cities.  Now, there's going to be, well, what about, I've been there, man.  Minnesota should have to, every, a lot of these places should have to re, like, sign up  to be part of the country.  What's wrong with us going down to 42 states?  Why the fuck does South and North Dakota get to be anything? 
[03:02:00]  Do we get to take over their state, though?  Yeah.  Or does it just stay there as a black hole?  We just swallow it up.  We just swallow it up to the next, Illinois can swallow up some other towns.  And make it Illinois.  And make a mega town.  And they follow the lead from New York and fucking Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Until there's no more of that dead bullshit in the middle.  Those ridiculous human beings, those drones that walk around the middle of the country.  Off the top of your head, what states should get bigger and what states should get 
[03:02:30]  smaller?  The bigger should...  New York?  Ready?  Yeah.  New England should be called Boston.  Okay.  So that takes Vermont, New Hampshire.  New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island gets swallowed up by Boston.  And not only this...  And Massachusetts gets swallowed up.  Fuck the states.  Right.  This should be...  Connecticut and Jersey should be called New York.  Pittsburgh should be called Philadelphia. 
[03:03:00]  Pennsylvania should be called Philadelphiaville.  You just took care of the Northeast really quickly.  All right.  Now work down the coast.  Holy shit.  The rest of the Northeast.  Delaware.  I mean, the rest of the East Coast.  Maryland.  Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Should be called...  Baltimore should be called...  That whole area should be called Washington, D.C. town.  Florida should be called Miami.  Yes.  That is it.  Spread Miami as far... 
[03:03:30]  Make beaches.  Do whatever you need to do.  But make that entire...  North Carolina can stay.  There's something that should be there.  But South Carolina...  So we get South Carolina.  North Carolina.  All right.  That's an easy one.  If you're driving cross country...  Yeah.  You're constantly in some cool...  You're in a place...  Things are going on...  Shit.  You're not going to some weird...  What about the weird middle of the country?  That's what I said.  How do you handle that?  But you have to... 
[03:04:00]  I think that makes Chicago...  Mm-hmm.  The West Coast?  The entire Midwest.  The entire Midwest is just Chicago.  Okay.  So if you're in...  If you're in Tennessee, you're in Chicago.  Yes.  Texas stays Texas.  Kansas...  Chicago.  Kansas is Chicago.  Any town you can't fly to in a big plane...  Can't get to Kansas City in a big plane.  You're not a fucking...  You're not...  You...  Chicago.  Connecting flight means...  Connecting flight. 
[03:04:30]  International.  Who the fuck...  Nebraska don't get to say they have an international airport, nigga.  Because...  Because fucking Canadian planes land there.  Suck a dick, man.  What about like...  What about like Montana, Wyoming...  They...  You know who gets them?  Yeah.  You share it between Oregon...  Mm-hmm.  ...and Washington.  You...  You...  Washington...  Because Seattle's real...  Yeah.  And Portland is real...  Right.  They swallow up that entire Wyoming, South Dakota... 
[03:05:00]  Idaho...  All that nonsense...  All that shit...  They get swallowed the fuck up.  And...  Okay.  Denver...  Denver...  Denver stays.  Denver's a major town.  And Denver sucks up the Four Corners.  All that shit.  Now what's next to Denver?  Yeah.  Denver's got fucking...  Utah...  Colorado has Utah next to it.  And then...  I think a little piece of...  Utah?  Of course...  Denver gets...  So Denver...  Utah becomes Denverville?  Salt Lake City even? 
[03:05:30]  Like...  That's gone.  It's now Denver.  No.  No.  Nebraska too.  Yeah.  Nebraska.  Come on, man.  I'm dead ass.  Now I know you're from there, but I don't defend Boston.  I'm from Boston.  I don't fucking get ultra defensive.  But these places, Maine, Maine, and New Hampshire...  Arizona, LA.  Wait a minute.  You know it takes only four hours to drive through every state in New England?  Eat ass.  Why would Rhode Island waste our time being a state? 
[03:06:00]  You can get through that in an hour.  I can understand 250 years ago, maybe, but not now.  You can cut through Connecticut to get to New...  You can completely avoid Rhode Island for your entire life.  When people were riding horses, it made sense.  Because, you know, it took a while.  But now with cars and planes, why fucking small states?  Fuck you.  Fuck you and your local...  I like this plan.  What do they call that shit?  Your local...  Regional... 
[03:06:30]  Regional fucking nonsense.  So the Super Bowl would just be just great.  That's it.  We're giant...  We need to stop this bullshit.  Giant states.  Giant cities.  I got one more...  Not even states.  Cities, yeah.  You got to handle Texas.  Texas is...  Texas is...  States.  Because Dallas is...  No, of course Texas stays.  But no, no.  Texas...  What does it grab?  What does it grab?  What's the...  Oh my God.  Because Houston, Dallas, San Antonio...  New Mexico.  It's got to grab New Mexico.  Fucking A.  And that's Texas. 
[03:07:00]  Texas gets New Mexico.  Arizona becomes L.A.  Arizona is now Los Angeles.  Los Angeles.  Reno can be San Francisco.  San Francisco.  Texas gets everything that it connects to.  Around it, right.  Okay.  To take a couple...  To take some pressure off of Chicago.  Right.  Being Chicago with a whole Midwest.  And Denver.  Yeah.  Okay.  Texas can take a lot of things.  And my final question.  How many states we go down in?  That's what I don't have a... 
[03:07:30]  It would be about five, six states.  Good.  Good.  That's about it.  What about Hawaii and Alaska?  Hawaii states.  Just cities.  Alaska can fucking go.  Alaska.  Why?  Alaska is Canada or Russia.  Get out of here.  We can sell them that.  Kenny.  I don't want to break up the funny, but there is a National Geographic special about this.  Uh-huh.  Like how the states got developed and why the borders are like why they aren't.  Yeah.  Like, I fell asleep watching it.  That's how good it is.  Of course you did.  But it's like the Erie Canal. 
[03:08:00]  Your TV fell asleep watching you.  You know, like big cities built up commerce.  You know, because in the old days they could just go down rivers and stuff.  And that's why...  Well, and so are you supporting that we changed what we did back then?  No, no.  I'm just saying, like, people back then was fucked up.  Right.  That's why...  That fucking is based pretty much on geography and what people have to do to get through rivers  and over mountains and things like that.  All right.  Danny kept track.  So you got the United States of Patrice. 
[03:08:30]  You got New York, Boston, Philadelphiaville, Washington, D.C. town, Miami, Chicago, Texas,  Denverville, San Francisco, L.A.  L.A.  You got L.A.  And Portland.  Can I see a map, please?  Because I could do this with a map.  I need to see a map.  Because I'll tell you.  I'll tell you what doesn't...  I've been in...  It's...  It's...  It makes a lot of sense.  It's just like subdivisions.  You know?  It's just subdivisions.  It's time to consolidate this country. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, stop this shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop this fucking shit.  And then you could get rid of so many politicians, because then it's just...  You don't need a representative from every fucking little district and fucking...  It'd be great.  Now I see this.  This is fantastic.  Texas gets...  Oh, Lord have mercy.  Texas gets Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, and Colorado.  Sucked in by fucking Texas.  One big Texas.  California, which would be Los Angeles, gets Nevada.  Arizona, and Utah. 
[03:09:30]  Colorado gets sucked in by Texas.  Colorado gets...  Whoa!  Denver is a bad motherfucker, but you just...  It's just not enough.  Washington and Oregon split.  Wyoming, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota gets all sucked up.  Wow, so...  And we will call it all because we'll make Seattle be a...  No, we'll make Portland be a subdivision of Washington, of Portland.  Portland, so...  So, Portland will be now Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Idaho will now be 
[03:10:00]  called Portland.  Wow, that's huge.  What the...  Now we have...  All right, moving over.  We have Chicago.  Okay.  Illinois will...  Chicago will be now consist of Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, and Missouri.  Okay?  Yeah.  What about Michigan and Wisconsin?  Michigan's in there.  And all of that is now called Chicago.  Chicago.  All right.  New York will be Pennsylvania...  No. 
[03:10:30]  What happened to that?  Wait a minute.  No, no.  New York will be...  Shit.  Jersey, Connecticut.  New York will be New England and Connecticut.  Holy shit.  So...  Fuck.  No, wait.  You got this figured out.  Go to the top.  Go to Maine and work your way down now.  You got the Boston thing figured out.  Because New York is so important.  Yes.  Why doesn't New York grab up?  It should be as big as swallowing up...  Hold on.  I got it.  ...Texas.  I got it, too.  I got it. 
[03:11:00]  New York should eat Ohio and Michigan.  And Rhode Island and Connecticut and Jersey.  And Maine, Boston.  You give us Rhode Island.  And let's take New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, as New England and Boston.  Yeah, you just take that shit over.  We're taking fucking parts of Canada.  Yeah, you could take that shit over for Boston.  No borders.  I think this may...  And only because it's supposed to be a cosmopolitan city.  But this may fuck up everything.  Boston...  I put it in the same thing as Denver. 
[03:11:30]  The entire Massachusetts is not important enough.  I say New York eats it all.  Eats all New England.  And Boston is a subdivision.  Just like Seattle is a subdivision of...  No, Portland is a subdivision of Seattle.  But they have still...  I'm Portland.  But that whole shit...  It belongs to...  Seattle, really.  So now New York...  Professor Patrice, what happens to the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry?  They got to get together. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  And wait...  How is that going to happen?  We can have...  Wait a minute.  We can have...  Still have sports.  I'm talking about...  Look it.  There's going to be some shit going on.  And then we have to maybe...  Wait a second.  Because football, basketball...  All these things are old too.  We should start to develop some new, more powerful sports.  More powerful.  Some fucking sports...  For example.  That where these seven motherfuckers that play or whatever... 
[03:12:30]  It's some major shit going on.  Big time.  And it'll be...  Wait.  We can...  Instead of 11 guys playing football...  Let's have 33 on each side.  Let's fucking...  33.  How big's the field?  Humongous, nigga!  Imagine how big the one in Texas is going to be!  We can just turn...  Fucking...  We can turn Iowa into a fucking...  A stadium!  Just for sports.  All right, so New York takes everything above it and Jersey. 
[03:13:00]  I think Philadelphia gets some things.  Philadelphia gets West Virginia.  Philadelphia can have Ohio.  And Philadelphia can have...  That's about it.  It should get Jersey, I guess.  I guess Philadelphia...  Pretty damn fucking close.  And we'll go...  Maybe a split Jersey in half.  And we make Miami will be...  Miami will be Alabama.  Georgia.  It will be South Carolina.  It will be Tennessee.  And North Carolina gets to survive. 
[03:13:30]  North Carolina will be part of D.C.  So D.C. now will be made of Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Kentucky.  That will be called Charlotte.  Or no, D.C. town.  That will be D.C. town.  D.C. town.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm in.  I like this.  Yes.  I like big change like that.  Oh my God.  That's good.  Can you imagine this?  I'm in.  This actually happens.  When do we vote on this referendum? 
[03:14:00]  And we erase this shitty fucking...  These lines.  All those imaginary lines have to go.  All of that shit.  We make new imaginary lines.  Because we can.  And you know what?  And we shut down all those shitty highways.  Those half-ways.  It's just a big 95 that shoots through.  A big ass 580.  A big ass 1.  And you just...  You fucking deal with that.  And you make the fucking highways 50 lanes.  And that's the infrastructure. 
[03:14:30]  Just big.  Everything's gotta be big and fucking 50 lanes.  That'd be really confusing.  I just found it.  I gotta get over to the right.  The United Areas of America.  The United Areas.  United Areas.  And if Canada wants to get in it, we'll take you over and figure that shit out too.  I love it.  Wow.  For real, man.  It's just nonsense.  All these fucking...  It is.  I've never heard it put quite this way. 
[03:15:00]  But, yeah.  That would be a major change to run on.  Now, you're talking change.  That's a fucking change to...  There you go.  But Chicago...  Why are we still being traditional?  Yeah.  Chicago, very mad on the phones.  Why?  He's saying...  It's Chicagoland.  The whole thing is Chicago.  Let's find out.  You get Wisconsin?  Yeah, you dummy.  I don't know.  He lives there.  John in Chicago.  Why are you mad?  This makes perfect sense.  Well, we don't want any of those other fucking stuff.  You got to take them, dude.  You got to take them.  He doesn't want them. 
[03:15:30]  You think New York wants New Hampshire?  No.  But here's the thing.  Listen, Chicago guy.  You are taxed with the responsibility of teaching North Dakota...  To be Chicago.  ...to be better.  And to be Chicago.  Stop being North Dakota.  Build some giant buildings and...  The only one we want is Wisconsin so we can enslave those kids.  This is the problem.  It's going to be fucked up. 
[03:16:00]  What about the...  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  I never...  Hold on, hold on.  What about the new slavery?  If you're changing the whole fucking thing...  Subjugation?  Yeah.  Come on.  That's just a people thing.  I'm not trying to say you should go...  What state do we get the new slaves from?  He's just...  If you had to.  If you had to.  Oh, my God.  This is if you had to.  Holy shit.  We're starting over and we're making these humongous states.  You might need slaves to build the 50-lane highways.  Borders are being changed.  You can't bring back slavery.  No, motherfucker.  We finally got them. 
[03:16:30]  I don't know.  Who's going to build the 50-lane highways?  What state do we get the slaves from?  Oh, wow.  Indigent service.  That's true.  We sacrifice one state and take all our slaves from there.  Okay.  All right.  You had to have me think for a minute.  All right.  What do you do?  Danny puts the state of Mexico.  This is called a if-you-had-to scenario.  Here's the situation.  We need people to build.  Out of the new state of Seattle.  Was it Portland or Seattle?  Portland.  Out of the new state of Portlandville.  You're right.  Who's the weakest state?  Who would you say is the weakest link state? 
[03:17:00]  I'm saying right away Idaho.  Bam.  They the slaves.  So we get all our slaves from Idaho.  Idaho the slaves.  To build the 50-lane highways.  Super highways.  In Texasville?  Yeah.  Wait, we could just give them one place.  Nah, because not enough people in Idaho.  Idaho got to do the shit in Portland.  All right.  That's Portland infrastructure.  I got to say, the South's pretty fucking uppity. 
[03:17:30]  So I'm going to say New Mexico.  Will be Texasville.  I'm going the other way.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Texasville will get New Mexico, because that belongs to Texas.  Right.  Right, so they'll get their slaves from New Mexico.  Let's say New Hampshire and Maine will be the slaves from New Yorkville.  Yeah.  And Boston, just to get a perk, since we did dismiss them.  Yeah.  They will be the, um, overseers.  So, Phillyville, Phillyville, Phillyville, Phillyville will let, um, it will be, uh, we will go, uh, Jesus, it's going to be a lot of mad motherfuckers, man. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, I see where you're going here.  I would say, I would probably say Ohio will be the slaves, and, um, they will fix Phillyville.  Sorry, Cleveland.  Ugh.  That's a big market for you.  Ah, well.  If LeBron was still there, we might go West Virginia.  Ah, shit. 
[03:18:30]  What about LeBron going back to Cleveland, by the way?  What do you mean?  You saw the game, right?  No, that, that was, it was sad, wasn't it?  It was sad for those people.  They realized something, really.  I think they realized that day.  They realized, there's two things they realized.  Yeah.  He's, he's really good, and he should have left.  Because that team now looks, I think, I think Cleveland's 7-17 this year.  It's just sad.  And Miami has the, pretty much the exact opposite record.  And they're getting, they're 18-8 or something like that.  And they're getting better.  They're just amazing. 
[03:19:00]  They're figuring it out, right?  Yeah, they're figuring it out.  And LeBron was shit-talking the whole fucking time.  You see him going up to the bench and look for his shit.  Because those were his kids, man.  They knew, they knew.  And Cleveland, I bet you Cleveland is less mad now after they see that he should have left.  Because what chance does he got with that team?  That means, the way they got beat means that LeBron couldn't even have really sat on the bench.  They just have nothing, man.  And it's, I mean, it's sad.  I mean, it's sad, you know.  Not to take away from your giant, humongous state.  No, it's fine. 
[03:19:30]  It's fine.  I can't wait until this actually gets picked up and comes to fruition.  Someone's saying you're brilliant because you can drive through all of New Hampshire, New England, excuse me, in eight hours.  And it takes you 14 to go across Texas.  Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying.  So your logic is right there.  It's like, I might be off with four, but it's so short to...  There's no reason why they didn't make that all one state back.  It just, it don't make no sense.  Back in the day, back in the day.  It makes no sense to have a South and a North Dakota. 
[03:20:00]  It's archaic.  It's what they call draconian logic.  Draconian.  It's senseless shit.  Why?  It's like shit that's based on stuff that was forever ago.  North and South Carolina?  For what?  Nonsense.  Confusing.  It's like street signs that are like South Elm and North Elm.  Just say Dakota.  Just call it Dakota.  They knocked down that fucking stupid wall in Germany.  Jesus.  At least start easy.  Just go Dakota. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, Dakota.  Carolina.  Carolina.  At least start there and see how people like it.  Virginia.  You know.  Go slow with this thing.  I like it.  Go slow.  I know there's a lot of angry motherfuckers.  They just take their state pride.  Yeah, they just take that shit.  Sorry.  Vermont and New Hampshire looks exactly the same.  One's upside down.  That's it.  So turn that into one.  That's an easy change right away.  It's a nice square.  Make it into a nice square state.  Massachusetts really is a mess other than Boston.  I'm going to tell you how bad Massachusetts is. 
[03:21:00]  You meet somebody from Massachusetts, they go, hey, I'm from Boston.  Right.  Where?  Springfield?  That's two and a half hours away.  Where are you from?  Peabody?  That's not Boston, motherfucker.  You're from the surrounding area.  God, that's funny, man.  That's so true.  Stop it.  Oh, shit.  That is so true.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, fucking.  Look how you can feel.  You know what?  You can really feel.  You know, the anger.  Because I've been to those places. 
[03:21:30]  But you know who's only angry about this?  Who?  The people that are getting sucked up.  Yeah, the fucking drones.  Do you remember when we first started at WS?  W, NAW, and the old jocks hated us there.  Of course.  And we're broadcasting, like, you know, from New York City.  And their argument with us was, you're not from New York.  You guys are Long Island guys.  So what happened to us?  Long Island's right there.  Yep.  But to them, they're like, you're not.  But we don't live in Manhattan.  Yeah, you're not.  You guys are foreigners.  You do now.  To this radio station. 
[03:22:00]  Well, I've been for a while.  I'm still Long Island.  I'm not allowed to leave.  I'm the king of Long Island trash now.  I can't leave.  It's my kingdom.  But now it'll be all of that fucking borough shit.  It just is New Yorkville, man.  New Yorkville.  New Yorkville.  I like it.  Does everything have to end in ville?  No.  Town?  All right, good.  You can vote on a name.  I mean, I'm just, I'm just, I mean, I can't think of everything to say.  Yeah, he's just laying down the borders.  Yeah, Eric is saying in Miami, Texarkana.  So they sort of, they're open to the idea.  They're just not all in yet.  Call it York. 
[03:22:30]  I'm in.  I like it.  All right, we gotta get the fuck out of here.  Patrice, you fucking rule.  I love it.  Your logic is just beyond amazing.  This is like fucking PBS when Patrice is in.  It's just educational broadcasting.  And I get all, and I get all the grief.  Yes.  Fat fucking asshole.  And then, and you guys are safe and come to work.  Hey, great show today.  Great show.  Patrice is like, you motherfucking piece of shit. 
[03:23:00]  Why?  Because I said just shitty, Idaho is mad?  Who's going to be mad?  Stop.  You're right.  I force you to pick the state for the slave.  You're right.  Just grow your potatoes and shut your face.  Dumb potatoes.  Get it.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Yes.  That's the big plug today.  Absolutely.  Oh, I got a, my special come out February 19th.  I'm excited for you, man.  We talked about it.  I love that.  I'm just thinking of air that.  I was there, and Patrice fucking nailed it.  Are you going through the editing process?  Yeah, man.  It's hard, too.  They're not fucking with you, are they?  No. 
[03:23:30]  They're pretty good?  They're pretty fair, yeah.  All right.  Good, good, good, good, good.  I mean, it's things I got to get rid of, and the DVD will have everything.  All the extra shit.  That's exciting.  So I'm hoping it upgrades me to special guest.  I've seen Patrice a lot, and he fucking hit it out of the park that night, man.  It's going to be a great special.  Sometime in February, we'll look for that.  Good.  All right, guys.  I will see Anthony on Friday.  I hope somebody gives me info.  Make sure you get the info, Patrice.  I will personally make sure of that.  And Opie, I'll see you next time.  Yeah, hopefully soon.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, we're going away soon for vacation.  Not vacation, but holidays.  All right, guys.  I love having Patrice in.  I think we have a few more shows left this year, right?  Fucking great.  Yeah.  I think I'm leaving on a high note.  Get that hat on.  Look at that hat, bro.  Fucking.  No one's going to tell you to pull up your pants today.  He has a dapper-looking motherfucker.  I would leave mine down.  Look at his hat.  His ass is sticking out.  His ass is sticking out.  His ass is sticking out.  I wish that motherfucker could tell me.  Yeah, see if he tells you to pull your fucking pants up, Patrice.  He ain't telling you nothing.  Thanks a lot, Patrice.  That is one funny motherfucker, man. 
[03:24:30]  He's literally.  Holy shit.  Literally the funniest fucking guy in life.  That guy's great.  Guy should be way bigger than he is.  Oh, my God.  But you know what's even better than Patrice, Danny?  What?  Anthony?  You know what could possibly, I think, even be better than Patrice?  I know that's hard to say.  Can I guess?  You can guess.  Let me send it to you telepathically.  Here we go.  Watch, watch.  Now I'm nervous.
