<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly from one subject to another.  The show began with Anthony describing his frustrating commute from Manhattan to Long Island, detailing traffic nightmares, a near-miss due to a fire, and even having to jump-start his Escalade.  This segued into a recounting of their disastrous interview with the Raconteurs (repeatedly mispronounced) at the Hit Factory.  They lambasted the poor organization, the awkward setup, and the lack of a microphone for Jimmy.  Their frustration extended to Steve Kingston, a former K-Rock program director with whom they had a history of conflict, whose flamboyant shirt was also noted.  The discussion included anecdotes about other musicians and their interactions with the online message boards. This segment concluded with a promotion for their Boston live show.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion of a poorly recorded song by Jack White's band, "Rackin' Tours,"  which the hosts extensively mocked for its degraded audio quality.  They also critiqued Katie Couric's move to CBS, offering disparaging remarks about her and other news personalities like Brian Williams and Rita Cosby.  The conversation took several shocking turns, touching upon Rosie O'Donnell's HBO special, 9/11 conspiracy theories, and making tasteless jokes about the deaths of Susan Smith's children and referencing infamous public goodbyes like Lou Gehrig's and R. Bud Dwyer's.  They further discussed firing staff members and their upcoming Boston broadcast during Easter weekend. Rich Voss was expected as a guest later in the show.

A staff member's departure to work for CBS Evening News and 60 Minutes was announced, followed by a graphic discussion of Star Jones's weight loss and her book about being the "perfect woman," with particularly vulgar commentary on her bowel movements.  Rich Vos and his wife Bonnie joined the show, leading to a lengthy and crude discussion about Rich's struggle to quit smoking, fueled by exasperation from Bonnie and vulgar contributions from the hosts, Colin Quinn, and Jim Norton. This segment also included Colin Quinn recounting a 9/11 Pentagon conspiracy theory, which was met with skepticism and ridicule.  They discussed various smoking cessation methods, including laser therapy, and a humorous anecdote about a past guest with a concerning lump in their mouth.

The show continued with discussions of PalTalk and a woman named Amanda Panda engaging in explicit acts online. This led to a discussion of a 15-year-old boy profiting from online sex work and subsequently informing on others involved. The Duke lacrosse rape allegations, "America's Funniest Moms" (featuring Paula Bell, Jess Day, Donna Mary, and others), and racial issues were all touched upon, along with numerous racially charged statements.  The show also included segments on "Little People, Big World," a listener's midget encounter, and the case of a Homeland Security employee soliciting a minor online, with debate on the issue of entrapment. The segment ended with more discussions about guns, stand-up comedy, and clips from "America's Funniest Moms,"  accompanied by the hosts' continued crude and offensive commentary.

Finally, a segment featured Doug promoting his new radio show on Howard 101. The hosts used homophobic slurs against Pharrell, claiming he had "turned on" them.  They joked about forcing laughter and their lack of authority. Doug mentioned using Pharrell's music on his show to avoid taking listener calls. The show ended with the hosts promoting their upcoming stand-up performances, noting Colin Clark's absence from one of them.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  I love when Hawk fucks up. 
[00:04:30]  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  You're not going to go. 
[00:05:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  all right 
[00:05:30]  hey what's going on  Well, I have to say, we're a bit tired.  Jesus Christ, ain't much really to do about being tired, you know? 
[00:06:00]  Ain't just ain't much to do.  Well, we had some stuff to do last night for the radio program.  Yeah, sure.  And it always sucks when we have something to do at night for the radio program.  Yeah, because we got to get up early.  Well, it more sucks for Anthony, though, because, like, you can't go home.  No, I can't go home. 
[00:06:30]  I want to go home.  Can't go home.  I did go home.  The rest of the country is not going to understand, but when you work in Manhattan and you live on Long Island,  it's just a nightmare.  Nightmare getting anywhere.  It's a nightmare.  Can't get home.  Our stupid politicians would rather worry about, you know, violent video games.  Ooh, scary shit.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Instead of fixing the roadways in a proper way so people don't have to spend half their lives commuting back and forth to Long Island. 
[00:07:00]  I was just telling Anthony, you got Manhattan.  Yeah.  A lot of people live on Long Island.  A lot of people live in Jersey.  A lot of people live, like, in Westchester County.  All those other roads, besides the roads out to Long Island, after rush hour, they're clear.  They're fine.  Yeah.  They got it figured out.  Long Island, they spent, what was it, like 10 years, like, trying to improve the commute, and it's still a complete nightmare. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Complete.  You understand, you know, in this day and age, if you work, you know, during rush hour, you're going to have some traffic.  But there shouldn't be traffic after rush hour unless there's a 10-car pileup somewhere.  8.30.  8.30 a night, going back to Long Island from Manhattan, you should not be sitting in an hour's worth of traffic.  I hit the wall of taillights.  And, you know, there's no accident.  No.  No nothing.  It's just the way it is.  It's just too many cars. 
[00:08:00]  And you sit there.  Then eventually, it just goes away.  When are the politicians going to tackle that problem?  Never.  Once you start tackling real issues that concern us.  I don't know why it is.  Is it some environmental thing?  Is it some county-by-county thing?  It's too involved is what it is.  Yeah.  The politicians would rather go after the easy targets.  We all know that by now.  It's so easy.  A violent video game comes out.  Ooh, we got to stop kids from playing that. 
[00:08:30]  Ooh.  Get it off the shelves.  Because road rage, you know, that's not a big issue.  You're talking people are really getting killed.  Right.  Not video game killed.  There's no real issue when you have to deal with road rage on a daily basis.  The quality of life goes down because you're spending, you know, twice as long on the road going home or coming to work.  And I was a raging.  And then I finally, you know, I checked myself.  I go, all right, hey, hey, hey, where are you going? 
[00:09:00]  Just settle down.  Settle down, you.  Because I'll start going crazy.  I'll look, you know, 10, 12 cars up and go, what?  Why isn't he up on the guy's bumper?  Yeah.  There's 20 cars.  And then there's the guy.  This happened leaving New York.  I decided to go home yesterday.  I had the option at 11 o'clock when the show ended to sit in that office until 6.30 and then go to the gig that we had to go to last night. 
[00:09:30]  It lasted about 15 minutes.  And for 15 minutes I sat there, listened to the incessant babble of our staff in the office and said, I've got to get out of here.  I've got to get out of here.  What were they talking about?  I don't know.  You hear Ben does a little cackling.  There's a lot of impressions of various people going on around here that aren't in the studio at the time or in the office.  Some done very well, by the way. 
[00:10:00]  Some very funny, but I had to leave.  I couldn't stay in there any longer.  So I left.  I was promptly greeted right out of the garage.  My first right turn onto 57th Street by what amounted to an 18 billion alarm fire on 57th Street.  Fire trucks going to a building, shutting down 57th.  That's okay.  57th, for those of you that know New York, isn't really a vital cross-town road. 
[00:10:30]  I believe it's just kind of like a side street.  Oh, it's a side.  It could be replaced by any of the streets around it.  It's like the only four-lane road in Manhattan.  Just a mess.  I had to divert and go off.  It took me about 45 minutes just to get off of Manhattan.  Now, mind you, that 45-minute ride in the morning, it's three.  Count them.  Three minutes it takes me to get from the tunnel to the front door of this establishment. 
[00:11:00]  Three minutes.  45 minutes it took.  And then the expressway, always a mess.  But got home because I had to jump my Escalade.  Remember?  Oh, yeah.  The battery was dead.  I remember that from yesterday, sure.  So I did that.  And then I had to drive back in.  It just, you know, that's one of the pluses that you guys have of living in the city.  That's one of the compromises I made living out on Long Island. 
[00:11:30]  I see, maybe a lot of people forget, but I used to live out on Long Island, and I just  had to give up.  I had to give up.  You gave up.  I don't want to live in Manhattan.  I don't.  I'm a suburb guy.  But you have to.  I don't want to, but exactly, I have to.  Because the commute finally got to me where I'm like, I can't do this anymore.  I just can't do it.  That's why I get made fun of a lot, which is fine.  I come in in the morning.  There's no traffic, really, in the morning.  And then at 11 o'clock, I am so out the door.  Because I know, it sounds ridiculous, but by 11 o'clock, any later, you're going to get 
[00:12:00]  traffic.  Well, because the lunchtime traffic starts.  Yeah, because we have this weird thing in New York City.  We have a lunchtime, like, rush hour.  Rush hour.  And it's caused by pedestrians.  A lot of pedestrians that have no clue.  Dude, I almost slammed into a woman.  And I'm very alert as to what is going on on the sides of the road as I'm driving. 
[00:12:30]  I don't just look to the side.  Every intersection I come up to, I slow down and I really give a good look before I go through  it, even if the light's green.  Because these fucking pedestrians.  A woman actually had to grab another woman and pull her out of the way of my truck because  she's on the cell phone crossing.  I have a green light, which obviously means she has that red stop hand because, God forbid,  it says, don't walk like the old days.  Someone from a foreign land won't understand that. 
[00:13:00]  So it's got the big red hand, says stop.  And she just walked right in my way.  A woman, like, pulls her back.  I was on the brakes already.  I saw it coming.  But that's the problem with the rush hour, lunchtime rush hour.  Pedestrians that don't know what the fuck they're doing.  You know you have three lanes sometimes on a roadway.  One to go straight.  One to make a right.  One to make a left.  Two to make a right.  One to go straight. 
[00:13:30]  Whatever the combination is, depending on the one-way streets in the area.  There will be asshole pedestrians that will not be on the sidewalk waiting for their turn  across.  They step into one of those lanes and now completely turn a three-lane road into a two-lane road.  And if I got to turn there, oh, does he get it from me?  Not just a beep-beep, but the window goes down and curses racial epithets.  I don't care what the fuck it is, get thrown out the window. 
[00:14:00]  And they get a stunned look on their face like, why is he, why, why, why, why?  Because you're in the road.  Because you're the asshole today.  Stay on the fucking road.  I don't drive up on the sidewalk, unless I have to, and I would never do it against  the light.  But these, they don't understand.  It's the road.  It's for the cars.  Stay on the sidewalk until you get the little green walking guy, and then walk on the road.  Don't stand in the fucking street.  That's why we have a traffic problem in New York.  A lot of it is based on a lot of cars that we have here, but a lot of it is also the fault 
[00:14:30]  of fucking pedestrians that don't know how to walk in this city.  Angers me.  But I got home.  And then I came back here, got in a little early, because I left very early.  Yeah, well, you have no choice.  Yeah.  You have to pick your spots when you can get in and out of Manhattan.  Found a great bar over there on 54th and 9th, I think it was, Valhalla.  Valhalla, yeah.  Nice.  The corner there was nice. 
[00:15:00]  All I did was, I was walking by, I looked inside, I saw a wall of taps.  Just a wall of taps, one of which, black, word Guinness written on it.  Boom, I'm in there.  You were in.  In there.  And it was just chick bartender with the giant tits.  Just in there, like, every guy was just sitting gawking at her.  And a couple of fans came in that were going to go to the show last night.  So we were hanging out, drinking a couple of beers.  So that was fun.  And then we went to the, uh, the gig. 
[00:15:30]  The hit factory.  The hit factory.  Which was a complete waste of time.  It was, uh, set up, uh, really badly.  Yeah, it was set up.  I know that someone bummed out and rolled their eyes as they listened to this, but it really was set up badly.  Who cares if they're rolling their eyes?  It was a fucking monumental waste of fucking time.  It was supposed to do an interview.  Jimmy's really not happy.  We'll get to that in a second.  And I don't blame him, actually.  Well, he shouldn't be.  I don't blame him.  For some reason, people don't realize, still, that this radio show is three guys. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  You know, it's three people.  It's three guys.  It's called the Opie and Anthony show just because it's been called that for many, many years.  And let's be honest, Jimmy's leaving us eventually anyway, so what the hell.  But for the time being.  Well, I put his name on the billboard.  And if it's going to be.  For the time being.  But, you know, I shouldn't even joke because Jimmy is this close to saying, you know, go fuck yourself.  Dude, I got no problem.  And he's going to walk out.  I got no problem with a two-person interview.  I really don't.  You know that. 
[00:16:30]  I could.  Fine.  But I wouldn't have wasted my time fucking showing up there.  I would have went to Jersey and done a motor vehicles thing for my sister that I was supposed to do.  Instead of standing there like a fucking cunt.  Yeah.  Because that wasn't set up right.  Again.  Again.  Yeah, it was really a weird setup.  I've never in the 62 years of radio that I've been doing, Opie, I've never had an interview like that.  It was just so odd.  It was really odd.  Well, to explain, we were interviewing the raconteurs, the raconteurs. 
[00:17:00]  First of all, this is Jack White's new band from the White Stripes, and he's awesome.  He's absolutely awesome.  We got to talk to him.  He's a really down-to-earth, nice guy.  And he's doing this new project without Meg, you know, his partner there in White Stripes.  And it's obviously a bunch of his pals from Detroit that have done their own band thing.  But these guys are all friends.  It's pretty obvious.  And they're like, all right, it's time to do a project together. 
[00:17:30]  I want to do something different.  This is Jack White talking.  And I've got these friends.  Let's see what we can do.  So the first mistake is they have a – the name of their band is either Raconteurs or Raconteurs.  And I spent all day yesterday, the day before, and minutes before even talking to the band trying to find out how you pronounce their name.  Yeah.  I was saying Raconteurs all day.  Don Wicklund says, no, it's Raconteurs. 
[00:18:00]  I thought it was Raconteurs.  So I start the interview by saying, hey, let's welcome the Raconteurs.  They laughed at me.  I'm like, oh, that's a great way to start an interview.  Oh, boy.  The band is laughing at me because they think I'm a dope because I don't know how to pronounce their name.  It's Raconteurs.  Is it Raconteurs?  I think it is.  Well, Don Wicklund said it's Raconteurs.  I go, are you sure?  Are you sure it's Raconteurs?  It's Raconteurs because I've been saying Raconteurs all day.  What's wrong with the who?  That's easy. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Sabbath, if I may, Jimmy.  That's easy.  In all fairness, yeah, I don't understand some of these bands that come up with these names that you're not really sure the pronunciation.  I mean, we could get a whole list.  There's a bunch of them out there.  So, I mean, yeah, we're supposed to do an interview with them, which is fine.  Every interview we've ever done, and we did a lot, especially at AAF in Boston.  Remember how many rock band interviews we did?  And what would happen is you usually go back to their little green room dressing room thing, sit down, or find some other place in the venue. 
[00:19:00]  You sit down.  You all have microphones.  And you kind of bullshit.  You sit there, a couple of beers on the table.  It's very rock and roll and backstage kind of thing.  Very cool vibe.  That wasn't the case last night.  The band comes out and stands in front of their instruments.  They stand where they're going to play. 
[00:19:30]  The drummer is sitting at his kit.  The other guys are standing by their microphones holding their guitars like they're going to start playing.  We, Opie and I, no Jimmy, because there's only two Mikes, are standing in front of them.  No, Jimmy was there.  Yeah, but...  That's the problem.  Jimmy was there standing awkwardly against the wall going, what the fuck?  No, Mike.  Because we have nobody that gets there first, apparently.  Everybody just shows up.  I don't know.  We don't have people that work for the show that would look at stuff like that.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:20:00]  I guess not.  Let's make sure.  So, me and Opie are standing there with Mikes in our hands.  Awkwardly talking to Jack White and the band.  The only two people really standing right in front of them.  So, picture a band and you standing there like, hi, how are you guys doing?  The band is in like a power position because they got their rock guitars.  Yeah.  The guy's behind the drum kit.  Yeah.  You know, Jack White's got a guitar strapped to him and he's got the mic in front of him. 
[00:20:30]  It's like us being here in front of our equipment, you know?  Yeah, it's a power position.  So, it's very awkward.  We're there with microphones.  I felt like the guy that's giving the mic in the audience of Oprah or something.  I think what you did was bad and you're a whore.  So, we were standing there with Mikes and we're just kind of awkwardly talking to them  and I kind of look to my right at Don Wicklin and I go, so, when does this start? 
[00:21:00]  He goes, oh, we've already begun.  Yeah.  We're rolling tape.  Rolling tape.  All right, I guess.  Okay, great.  So, Opie kicks it off with, um, all right.  Opie and Anthony at the Hit Factory with the Rackin' Turs.  Rackin' Turs.  Ha, ha, huddle, huddle.  Because right before we start, I'm like, are you sure it's Rackin' Turs?  Yes, I'm positive.  Even though my instinct was they have to be called the Rackin' Turs. 
[00:21:30]  I didn't hear the question.  I just knew it went wrong because I heard something like the laugh and I said to Steve, did he say  it wrong?  He went, yes, he did.  Yes.  I was saying it is.  Dude, I'm not the only one.  Everybody was walking around there going, is it the Rackin' Turs or the Rackin' Turs?  And then, give me the sheet from yesterday because it was phonetically spelled out that would  make you think it's Rackin' Turs.  But when you asked him about his previous band.  And honestly, I don't even know if it's Rackin' Turs or Rackin' Turs.  When Obie did ask him about his previous band, The White Strips, that was a little bit of 
[00:22:00]  an awkward...  No, you didn't.  Oh, gosh.  It's funny.  As he said that joke a few minutes ago, I thought of that one and went, no.  No?  It just, at the time, he wasn't there because somebody started talking.  But you know what?  Thank you.  It wasn't that bad.  It was such an awkward thing yesterday.  I could have...  But it was such an awkward setting.  I could have easily said that.  Easily said that.  Oh, yeah.  I know you guys were joking and all that, but I could have easily said that.  Hard, awkward setting.  So now we're just standing in front of the band. 
[00:22:30]  They're three, four feet away.  Everyone is standing.  And now we attempt to do an interview, which, to be quite frank, was average at best.  It was like five minutes of, you know, hey, you know, what makes you get a whole band?  You have so much success with White Stripes.  And what's the difference?  You know, you got a lot more people.  Is it hard to work with more people than just the two he is?  Blah, blah, blah.  You know, the basic...  It wasn't like when we have guests in the studio, we like to get away from that. 
[00:23:00]  We get the basic info out, but we like to get away from it and have more of a hangout-type atmosphere.  It's not a straight go-ahead interview.  We don't do straight-ahead interviews like, you know, you turn on a rock station and hear the rock jock,  and he's got in-studio rock guests.  It's the straight-ahead rock interview.  That isn't us.  We hang out.  It's the way it's always been.  There was no way to be casual in that situation.  No, not in that situation.  If we were sitting in the engineering room with some beverages, something, an atmosphere 
[00:23:30]  that was more conducive to just hanging out one-on-one as people, that would have been  a lot easier to do than just us standing in front of a band.  Well, we just need people around us that know what they're doing.  I mean, that's a tough one.  To know what they're doing, because the setup last night was we were going to talk to the 
[00:24:00]  band for 5, 10, maybe 15 minutes, depending.  Obviously, after 5 or 6 minutes, we're like, this is just...  Yeah.  Play the music.  Play the music, because there's nothing good happening here.  No.  And then there was a 40-minute break, which proves to me that there was no reason for them  to be standing in front of their instruments for the interview.  They didn't just start playing like we go, and here's the Rack and Tahir, you're a seat.  Right.  So when they put it together, it's going to sound cool in a way, because also I'm like,  all right, let's hear some tunes or whatever, right? 
[00:24:30]  And then what you're going to hear when they throw it on XM, they're going to go right into  music with an audience.  But the reality is we taped the first segment by ourselves, standing in front of the band  as they're standing in front of their instruments.  40 minutes before they play.  And then they went back into their green room to hang for 40 minutes.  So logically, I'm like, why don't we have people around us that understand this shit,  where you would set up more of a studio situation, stools, take mics into the green room, whatever,  get the interview done that way, and then they go on stage and play. 
[00:25:00]  Although it was 40 hysterical minutes.  But why don't people have logic around here?  They have some, maybe their stools were ordered from the stool factory, and we didn't have  any.  Well, I want to apologize to Jimmy, because this is the God's honest truth, Jimmy.  I saw a microphone.  That's all I was thinking.  I'm like, all right, I got a microphone.  Anthony grabbed his mic.  Stupid me, because I just think that people would take care of the basics.  I didn't even think that you didn't have a microphone. 
[00:25:30]  I thought you were like kind of just, you know, behind us with a microphone.  I had no idea until it was over.  You guys aren't supposed to think of that.  You guys got to think of interview questions.  That's not what you're supposed to.  You're supposed to be thinking of, how does this interview get done?  You're not supposed to be thinking of, is the microphone there?  That's what other people are supposed to be thinking of.  But why don't we have people around us?  There was fucking 20 people there from XM.  Right, but why don't we have people around us that if, all right, yeah, it's called open  Anthony, whatever, but if they see Jimmy, why can't we have a guy that goes, oh, okay, 
[00:26:00]  Jimmy is, Jimmy needs a mic.  Yeah, maybe they weren't sure Jimmy was coming.  I don't know.  But honestly, you should just assume every single fucking time and have three things there  always.  And if he doesn't show because he's doing something else or whatever, then fine.  But at least you're ready for it.  If we are going to be doing something.  Jimmy was sitting, walking around, he was in the green room with us for easily a half  hour, 40 minutes before we did this interview.  So that gives people enough time around us to go, all right, Jimmy's here, so that means 
[00:26:30]  three people.  So let me double check to make sure there's three mics.  It blows my mind that there's no logic around us, that people can't problem solve and make  sure things are set before we do it.  Nobody cares.  Not one person came to us and said how the interview was going to take place.  I, stupid me, once again, I'm going to call myself stupid.  I just assumed we were going to sit down in a green room with comfortable chairs or stools  and talk to the band for 15 minutes. 
[00:27:00]  Stupid me.  I didn't feel like I needed to ask what was the interview set up going to be like.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  And then I was stunned when they walked out and stood behind their instruments, because  when I was pulling my mic, I was still thinking, well, there's probably other mics around and  they're going to, maybe we'll sit around the floor or something.  I don't know.  We'd done how many of these types of interviews, Opie?  How many band interviews did we do over a long, illustrious career?  Can't even really count.  There are so many and never, ever like that. 
[00:27:30]  They've always been done very comfortably and very socially, you know, not like the band  setting up ready to play, you standing in front of them, like an audience member kind  of thing, that's getting the opportunity to ask questions.  It was like some kind of a college thing where they have a Q&A afterwards.  That's what it felt like.  College.  Where, here's a mic, ask your favorite rock star a question.  And the band seemed like they were cool and they were willing to talk, but for them it 
[00:28:00]  was awkward, because Jack White even once said, let me go grab my guitar so I have something  to hold on to.  The only reason he grabbed his guitar, he felt awkward.  He felt weird, standing there with his arms at his side, standing at his microphone.  Whoever produces for XM, and I have no idea, and I'm not spoiling the wheel, who knows?  I have no idea.  They just flat out don't know what they're doing.  Flat out don't know what they're doing.  Because then it's like, we didn't even introduce the band.  They played five or six songs from their new project. 
[00:28:30]  Don't know the names of any of the songs or anything.  No.  So you're going to hear an interview by Ant and I that's average.  Average at best.  It didn't stink, but it was just there.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden the band's just going to play.  That's it.  That's what you get.  With no real interaction between the songs to tell the people what they're hearing or  anything.  Maybe in post-production they'll figure something out.  But I don't know.  But to not have a microphone for Jimmy, I don't even know what to say anymore.  It's just, it's so stupid. 
[00:29:00]  This is what makes me, it just makes me fucking so irritated.  It's not, I couldn't believe me.  If it was, they said, look, they're just going to do this interview.  These guys, okay.  I had to go in a fucking Jersey because I had to turn my title to my old car over to  my sister because I accidentally wrote my last name instead of her married name and  I tried to white it out on the title.  I've done that.  And Jersey won't accept that.  And that sucks.  Yeah, it's my own stupidity and I blamed her ex-husband.  I'm like, he's dumb, he's dumb.  And she's like, well, he said you did it.  I'm like, oh my God, I did do it.  I thought it was him the whole time.  Fucking stupid Charlotte.  It was me. 
[00:29:30]  So anyway, I'm going to go to Jersey and this fucking monumental waste of time.  And we had enough people there from here, our own people, that could have just fucking  saved me that trouble and I would have just went into Jersey and not dealt with that shit.  Yeah.  Going to Jersey.  And like I said, Jimmy, I apologize.  I just assumed you had a mic and you weren't talking.  And then when I turned around, it was done and I saw Jimmy's face and then realized he  wasn't holding anything.  I'm like, oh shit.  But dude, you guys aren't supposed to think of that.  It's true.  You guys are not supposed to think of that.  I know, but all I'm saying is if I saw that as it was going down, I would have just 
[00:30:00]  stopped and said, look, he's part of the show.  He needs a freaking microphone.  That's like Radio 101.  The only thing I could come up with in anyone's defense is that Jimmy's mic was in Jack White's  pants.  Holy shit.  That's the first thing I noticed.  Pretty much the only excuse that would be legitimate because what the hell is going on?  Did I comment to you as soon as you walked in?  Okay.  As soon as you walked in, Jimmy's like, look at the size of his cock.  Look at his package. 
[00:30:30]  You couldn't not notice it.  You couldn't not notice it.  He was wearing very tight pants.  I thought, I didn't think he was that tall.  A very tall guy.  The guy could kick some ass.  That's pretty obvious.  And just, I don't know what was going on in there.  I thought Ben was actually in his pants, which would have been quite ironic.  It was like, hey, Bruce Dickinson poster.  Hey, Robert Plant.  I'm fucking.  It was really.  He was going for that rock and roll star shot, wasn't he? 
[00:31:00]  Dude, he has to wear a cock ring or something like that to showcase.  Look, I have a penis.  They never fucking balls like that unless you position them.  There is something going on there.  It's not healthy.  No.  And, you know, we want to do more of these things.  Yes, of course.  This was set up by the arch enemy, Steve Kingston.  And it was the first project we've done with him ever.  And it didn't go too well, I got to tell you.  So, you know, hopefully as we get more of these opportunities, will we live and learn? 
[00:31:30]  Hopefully we'll figure it out.  Hopefully.  We'll live and learn.  The fact that we got them was very cool.  The Hit Factory just being there.  The history.  Yeah.  That was very cool.  Lennon recorded a double fantasy there.  Yeah.  We were walking around.  And I saw a piano and I'm like, what are the odds?  And Jimmy, you guys are laughing at me.  I'm like, what?  He could have done Imagine on that thing.  Things in 20,000 pieces sold all over the planet.  I was going to take like a screwdriver and take a key.  Done. 
[00:32:00]  That piano is gone.  But full of history.  Paul Simon did Graceland there.  Yeah.  Very cool to be in there.  Songs in the Key of Life.  A little album by Stevie Wonder was done there.  Done there too.  Mm-hmm.  Bruce Springsteen, born in the USA.  A lot of history.  And the Stones recorded their disaster, Emotional Rescue.  Sold a lot though.  In that fine studio.  Not one of their biggest albums though.  But yeah, a lot of that.  It was just the fact that that interview part was awkward. 
[00:32:30]  The fact that we were able to get that together and everything was pretty cool.  But we've got to work on that.  We've got to work on a lot of things.  It's just so frustrating.  You know that yesterday we celebrated a year and a half at XM?  On air.  Was it?  On air.  We started a year and a half ago yesterday.  And we still got basic problems.  Radio 101 type problems.  Yeah.  Basic logic that people just don't have.  Well, there is a transition between a business that's selling widgets or whatever it is and a company that is selling entertainment. 
[00:33:00]  And there are certain aspects of it that are still in the selling equipment portion where now I think more importantly is the entertainment.  And they are getting people that are more entertainment oriented.  It's just got to, you know, it's got to work out. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  I didn't see much conversing going on between you and Steve Kingston last night.  Well, there was a – he was actually – it seemed to me there was an avoiding thing going on.  He spoke to Steve C.  Well, bring Steve C. in here.  Why don't you explain Kingston because, like, you know, we do – every day we have new listeners.  Steve Kingston worked over at K-Rock in New York, the Howard Stern flagship station. 
[00:34:00]  He was the program director over there.  And when we got fired out of Boston, we came to New York.  We had two opportunities.  One at K-Rock, which was run by Steve Kingston, and one at WNEW where we ended up going, unfortunately.  Because at the time, both stations wanted us.  They were owned by the same company.  The company, after we interviewed with both stations, said, you guys decide where you want to go.  Where do you want to go, NEW or K-Rock?  And we figured K-Rock was the perfect fit for us because we worked at WAF in Boston that played the same exact music. 
[00:34:30]  So we're like, we could step right into our old jobs, basically, in a bigger market.  This is a no-brainer.  And NEW was just a complete and utter mess.  Yeah.  And Kingston, and that's what's weird.  Our relationship with Kingston started off great.  We interviewed with him, and we're like, yeah, we can work for this guy.  And so we told our agent to tell Kingston and K-Rock we're going to go there.  And I was told that Kingston found the news out while he was at dinner and actually jumped up and down in a restaurant, scream and yell, like he won a lottery. 
[00:35:00]  He was so excited to have us.  And then two days go by, and we haven't heard from Steve Kingston or K-Rock.  We never heard from him again.  That's key to this story, after him wanting us so bad.  Never heard from him again, which pisses me off to this day.  Didn't have the balls to, like, personally call us, even though I was talking to him on the phone prior.  And just told our agent, ah, we've decided to pass on those guys.  So there was some kind of corporate company thing going on that we weren't privy to.  Then we were exiled to NEW.  Exiled to NEW, which, you know, I mean, we were very successful. 
[00:35:30]  We did well, but boy, that station stunk on ice.  We were very successful over there, but it was a real, real pain in the ass.  Yeah.  And during our tenure over at NEW, everything we tried to do, as far as bands were concerned, especially, was just undermined by Steve Kingston.  He was a vicious competitor, I will say that, but we were working for the same company.  That's the difference. 
[00:36:00]  If he was working for, let's say, Clear Channel, and he was pulling the same shenanigans, you'd be like, you are a motherfucker, man, but I got to tell you, what a competitor.  But we're working for the same company.  Right.  So that's what made it so odd, and that's where the bad blood came from.  We should have been able to have on who we wanted.  Obviously, Howard wasn't having a problem getting his guests, you know, let us do our show.  Same company, but, you know, that's where the bad blood came from.  And we found out from multiple sources that he was the guy that was cock blocking us and making sure bands weren't coming over. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, he was going to record companies.  The important bands that they were playing at the time.  Oh, we got the crappy bands.  Woo-hoo.  Oh, did we get them.  But, you know, that's what was going on.  So there was a problem there.  Now he works here.  And last night was really the first face-to-face we had.  In eight years.  In eight years.  And the first time I've talked to him in eight years.  And I will say, there was some of the most vicious dialogue going back and forth during the time we were on the air between everybody involved. 
[00:37:00]  Just vicious, horrid, awful things were said.  It's just terrible.  I believe we said something that we, like, jerked off to his wife's voice every morning.  It was really, it was typical, what it was, was typical ONA.  It was very bad.  Both barrels. 
[00:37:30]  Shoot us with a pea shooter.  We come back with a howitzer kind of a thing, you know.  At least you guys had the fucking balls to say it on the air and your real names and you didn't hide behind some fucking corporate nonsense.  At least you said it.  Oh, we said it all right.  Awful.  So, last night, first face-to-face, and I guess Steve C was one of the first people that broke it because, right, we got fired.  Everyone got flushed out the toilet of any W that had any involvement with us.  Except me.  Except Earl Douglas because he's black and they needed a black guy for the equal opportunity employment. 
[00:38:00]  And Steve C, because he's a sexy man.  I don't know what it was.  Steve was more production.  Yeah.  His official job title was production director, excuse me, but he was working for us all the time.  Yeah.  But he wasn't officially part of our crew.  No.  So, it was a little technicality that allowed him to slide through, which I don't think he was happy about because he was in hell after we lost it. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, the station turned into, I don't know what kind of format, 20 different formats.  Yeah, two years of a bunch of different formats, and Ope's right.  Some idiot came up with something called Blink.  Oh, what a retard.  What?  That has got to be.  It's the worst thing I've ever heard of.  Oh, sorry, Elo.  I blinked.  No, that wasn't.  It couldn't have been Elo.  He's fronting for somebody.  He couldn't have done something that dumb.  You get Elo on the phone, though, he'll deny that he would actually deny it. 
[00:39:00]  Of course he will.  I was not him.  It sounds just like him, too.  Blink and you miss it.  Oh, we love it.  Like your barber?  Honestly, the concept wasn't that bad.  The execution was horrendous because they wanted to be a gossip type of station and stuff,  but they weren't willing to give you the real gossip.  Yeah.  It was like PC gossip.  It was just awful entertainment.  Well, they wanted to do.  It could have worked.  They wanted to do, and this is a quote, Inside Edition and Access Hollywood on the radio. 
[00:39:30]  Now, mind you, Inside Edition and Access Hollywood can't do 22 minutes a day.  It can barely do 22 minutes a day with video.  How was the station going to do it 24-7?  They should have just lied about people.  Of course.  Like a current affair kind of thing.  Right.  Be mean-spirited and just lie about people.  J-Lo has the age.  We'll tell you about it.  You know, something like that.  Well, let me ask you something, Hef.  What kind of...  Yeah, really.  Can I feel the material?  Yes, you may.  Steve's wearing... 
[00:40:00]  It's very shiny.  Wow, that is shiny.  That fucking shirt is enragingly awful.  I'm so glad you dislike it.  I'm so pissed those are artificial flames.  Did you just get back from Tokyo?  I know.  This is very kimono-ish.  He's like that white businessman that's just trying to fit in in Tokyo.  What is it?  They walk on your back there.  It's amazing.  You have to find these shirts on eBay.  I can't find these anywhere else.  I've bound my feet.  It's a shiny, red, silky-feeling shirt. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  It really is.  It's like a short-sleeved robe shirt.  That's exactly what it's like.  Yeah, with embroidered flames on it.  You found that on eBay?  I did.  It sure wasn't E-gay.  E-gay is one letter.  You know, I'll double check.  It's too shiny, Steve.  Oh, it's great.  I love the way these shirts feel.  I'm aware that I'm...  It's very Steve.  Steve has a fashion sense all to his own.  Yes, it's called awful.  Yeah, thank you.  Whatever it's called, it's his.  That's right.  It's mine.  Anyway, so Steve had the first real face-to-face with Kingston last night. 
[00:41:00]  So what?  How did that go for you?  He was a lot more mellow than I remember him ever being.  Now, you kept in touch with us.  Steve kept in touch with us during the time we were fired, and Steve still worked there.  Steve was one of our so-called spies a little bit.  You know, he kept his job, but he would tell us, you know, oh, my God, you should see what's  going on over there.  This one's out the door.  This one's...  Steve Kingston's pulling his hair out of his head.  He's throwing things.  It's hysterical.  Right.  You know, things like that. 
[00:41:30]  Well, I mean, it's not like people didn't know that I knew you guys.  Yeah.  I was around because of a technicality.  Well, we really got to get rid of this guy.  Well, you can't just fire the production guy because he's friendly with Ovi and Anthony.  That was exactly the reason that I was still there.  And, you know, I was doing my job, and I was doing it well, and I didn't get fired.  So, yeah.  So, I stayed there through all those format changes.  And, you know, Kingston, I talked to him last night, and he was very friendly.  Yeah.  He was extremely friendly, extremely nice.  And I got to be honest, outside of the work environment, and even when I was there, he  was very pleasant and a very nice guy. 
[00:42:00]  And I was at his house in Jersey, and he was, you know, a very cool guy.  His family's nice, but at work...  What's that?  Maybe.  Maybe.  That's right, Lou.  Yeah.  And, but at work, it was at that fucking debacle of a station.  It was not fun.  So, he came up to us, though, and said he was a little nervous.  Yeah, he was.  He was.  I told him not to be, but he was just...  He was a little nervous that he was going to finally, like, see us for the first time  in eight years after all the bad blood.  It was a lot of bad blood going on. 
[00:42:30]  And he had kind of gotten away twice with passing us by, just missing by a doorway, just kind  of waiting till we were over.  And I don't know if it was on purpose or anything.  Over in one area.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  And then he walks out another area.  There was a whole avoidance thing going on.  Yeah, there was a avoidance thing.  From both sides.  And I'm in a little, like, room that's right outside the studio where the Rackin' Tires  were going to perform.  And all of a sudden, Ben's to my left and starts his cackle. 
[00:43:00]  And he kind of looks toward the doorway.  And all I saw was E-Rock.  I'm like, all right, yeah, we can make fun of E-Rock some more.  I mean, that's what I thought he was getting at.  One of Ben's favorite things to do.  That's what I thought he was getting at.  But it turns out that Kingston was sneaking through that area as fast as possible.  And he snucked through to the hallway.  And that's when you chased him down.  Well, he ran and kind of walked at a quick pace down the hallway.  And that's when I yelled, you're going to avoid us all night, you hump. 
[00:43:30]  And he turned around and looked.  And then I walked down the hallway, shook his hand, and said, you know, what's up?  And, you know, kind of broke the ice a little bit because it was a little awkward if we were  going to have to avoid him the whole night.  You know, he set the thing up.  We're there.  And, you know, he's sneaking around, and we're sneaking around.  It's just a little awkward.  And it's unavoidable.  We're going to be working together.  And, you know, he's got, obviously, the really good connections with the labels and stuff. 
[00:44:00]  And, you know, he can bring some pretty cool music guests to our program.  So we shook hands, very quickly changed the subject to flying, flying in small aircrafts with Lee.  And that was, you know, the extent of the conversation, pretty much.  Nothing about the good old days or anything.  But a little icebreaker, so we didn't have to, you know, avoid each other or anything like that. 
[00:44:30]  So that was, you know, my first meeting with him in eight years.  And then, I guess, an hour later, easily an hour later, I'm on a leather couch getting ready to just kind of check out the Rackintars.  Thanks for helping me out with the name of the band, you fuckers.  And I'm sitting next to Lindsey.  And all of a sudden, I look up.  And he's standing there with a glass of wine. 
[00:45:00]  He goes, hey.  Hi, Steve.  I'm like, and then he goes, how was your vacation?  I'm like, it was great.  And I see he's drinking wine.  I go, how's the wine?  He goes, it's good.  You want some?  I'm like, no.  And then I go, this is my girlfriend, Lindsey.  This is Steve Kingston.  They shake, say hi.  And then I just continue to stare at where the.  Stared away.  At the, where the Rackintarers were going to perform.  Rackintarers. 
[00:45:30]  That was pretty much it, really.  That was it.  A little icebreaker.  How was your vacation?  Yeah.  Drinking wine.  How was your vacation?  Here's my girlfriend.  Good.  Remember the time you fucked us over with Green Day?  That would have been a good one.  Right.  How was your vacation?  Great.  Good weather.  Hey, remember when you ass fucked us with Green Day?  Hey.  Remember when you told Matt and Trey not to go on our program?  That was a good one.  After we had a great relationship with those guys?  Okay, then.  Nice to meet you. 
[00:46:00]  Good to see you guys again.  Remember when you told Buck Cherry to make believe they were sick so they couldn't come  in and do an interview?  After we were promoting a rock show on Long Island?  But then they played that night.  And then they played that night and we had to sit around awkwardly because we wanted to  punch Buck Cherry in the face.  Yeah.  For not having the balls to come on our show anyway?  Remember that time we gave away the information on one of your secret concerts and you ripped  the gold record off the wall and threw it? 
[00:46:30]  One of my personal favorites.  So I guess there was some ice breaking going on last night.  Yeah, there was some ice breaking.  Hey, very awkward, but there was some ice breaking.  The guy's a fierce competitor, working for XM now.  I think only good could come of it.  That's what I think.  I think if he takes some of the shit he dealt out to us and deals it out to an enemy, I think  it'd be pretty good. 
[00:47:00]  We'll have to wait and see.  We'll see.  We'll have to wait and see.  But there you have it.  There's a story from the Hit Factory last night with Jack White's brand new band, the  Rackin' Tours.  Rackin' Rackin' Tours.  How do you spell the last part of it?  E-U-R-S.  I believe it's tours.  By Rackin' Tours.  Rackin' Tours.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  It is an oldie word.  Because as far as my English studies go, that's how I would pronounce that word.  But I was told last minute, no, I'm sure it's the Rackin' Tours. 
[00:47:30]  Isn't it someone who tells interesting stories or humorous anecdotes?  Something like that.  A Rackin' Tours.  Yes, I do believe.  A lot of people are saying we've got to get Kingston on the air.  That wouldn't be a bad idea.  I don't think he has the balls to call the show, though, to be honest with you.  Jesus, let the guy settle in.  You know what kind of abuse he'd take just being on the air of this show, so.  I wasn't mean to him.  I didn't feel like talking to him. 
[00:48:00]  No.  I was polite.  You were, um.  Cordial.  You were cordial, yet cold.  That's what I would, how I would put it.  Yeah.  All right.  The Rackin' Tours at the Hit Factory.  We got a little taste of what they did for everybody.  Because a lot of people did want to go to this thing yesterday.  And I guess we only had, like, what, 20 people?  Yeah.  It looked like a lot more than 20.  We're checking out the band.  They're all in our way.  Steady as she goes. 
[00:48:30]  This is, uh, the...  That's a single.  This is the single from the Rackin' Tours, I guess.  This was recorded last night at the Hit Factory.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Find another girl and sat her down with me, and I'll see you next time on the Rackin' Tours, and I'll see you next time on the Rackin' Tours, and I'll see you next time on the Rackin' Tours. 
[00:49:00]  See you next time on the Rackin' Tours, and I'll see you next time on the Rackin' Tours. 
[00:49:30]  Steady as she goes.  Steady as she goes.  Steady as she goes.  Well, here we go again.  You found yourself a friend that calls you out.  But no matter what you do, you'll always be as low as you're driving around. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, so steady as she goes.  When you have completed what you thought you had to do, and you'll have to beat it to the point stable through, then you'll get along.  It was Whip'em Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway. 
[00:50:30]  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I was in Boston, bro.  The Opie and Anthony Show is returning to Boston this month for a special Marathon Monday broadcast. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, it's hilarious.  Join Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the O&A Show crew Monday, April 17th, for a live broadcast from Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street.  Special guests to be announced.  The celebration will commence promptly at 8 o'clock in the morning, and continue until the beginning of the 11th hour anti-meridium.  No, Steve, I'm not going to say fantastic.  Find another way to end it.  21 and older. Doors open at 7.30 a.m. 
[00:51:30]  First come, first serve, so get there early.  It's going to be fantastic!  See, Fan, Travis is a team player.  Nice, Jim.  Good order right there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday, isn't it?  We're up to Wednesday already?  It's Wednesday!  Shut up. 
[00:52:00]  We love the wow. We love the wow.  I saw a lot of wow stickers yesterday.  Did you?  Yeah, I'm starting to see more and more.  I'm starting to see the new ones, which is kind of cool.  The XM ones, right.  You always see the old school WNEW wow stickers in the New York area.  All covered with soot.  But now I'm starting to see the brand new XM Satellite Radio wow stickers.  Go to opianthony.com to get your wow stickers.  Self-addressed stamped envelope will get the job done.  Basically, you get the wow on your car, and there's girls out there that will flash you when they see the wow. 
[00:52:30]  They love to flash as they're driving around.  On Whip'em Out Wednesday.  And, of course, I love it right here on our own Pal Talk.  Yeah.  We're getting wowed.  But, oh, maybe I shouldn't talk about Pal Talk.  I don't know.  There was this 10-page thread on Whack Bag.  Pal Talk.  They talk about it too much?  What do you think?  Yeah, I think they talk about it too much.  Too much.  Can I start a thread on there? 
[00:53:00]  Please.  My thread's going to be...  Do you think they talk about dumb things a little too much on this message board?  I got into that thread last night and was like, you've got to be shitting me.  There are people that are arguing or complaining that we talk about Pal Talk too much.  We, first of all, barely talk about it.  We talk about it when something happens on it, which is rare.  Most of the time, it's just us on camera.  There were people complaining about it that don't even have it. 
[00:53:30]  They're like, yeah, I don't like when they talk about it because I don't have it.  And, you know, I don't need to just look into the studio anyway.  And meanwhile, they have no idea that they're hearing stuff that's going on during commercial breaks,  which sometimes is funny, sometimes informative, sometimes we don't remember to shut the thing off.  You know, there's just shit going on.  Which could lead to huge rumors that start.  Right.  That start, and we have to watch ourselves.  But just the argument, if you don't like it or don't want it, you just don't get it.  But the fact that, like, people, they spend too much time talking about it. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I am.  And there's beautiful girls showing their tits on it because they love flashing us on the Paltor.  It's wonderful.  Especially on Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Right, on Whip Them Out Wednesday.  They're in the spirit of things.  Of course.  There you go.  And there.  Oh, was that too much?  I don't know.  But make sure you get a wow on your car or your truck.  You can get the homemade wow signs.  You can ride in the dirt in the back of the trucks.  But it's happening all over America.  We have a wow line, right? 
[00:54:30]  Do we go to the wow line every once in a while?  I'm assuming.  Because I don't get to hear the commercial breaks because we're too busy, you know, gossiping and taking leaks and getting coffee orders.  I listen on the replay and I hear some of the commercial things and I just start laughing.  Like that last one that was playing with Jimmy's acting.  Yeah, for the wow.  I will not do that, Steve.  Jimmy's horrific acting is just the best thing. 
[00:55:00]  And I crack up laughing.  Well, it's a Wild Bill production.  Wild Bill production.  Good old intern Bill wrote another piece, another promo.  We had to turn down one of his scripts last night.  One of his scripts was turned down last night.  It was too much.  Too much of a situation that should not be addressed too much.  At this time.  At this time, yeah.  You know what I'm talking about.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Can I have to back up a second and say something about the pal talk and the message boards?  I love Wackbag, but no one on Wackbag ever posted that we talk about Wackbag too much. 
[00:55:30]  Ah.  And the message boards have taken a little bit of a hit, maybe because people are more  in the rooms than they are on the message boards.  Yeah.  But the thing about this pal talk or any type of a video thing is it's more you have to  look and say things.  I mean, a lot of people don't do it on cam.  Yeah.  But if you have the balls to cam up and say what you want to say, well, that's fucking  a lot better than hiding.  It's a little more accountability.  Than hiding in anonymity.  And people shit on Dugout Dug and he certainly is a boob to be reckoned with. 
[00:56:00]  But you know what?  Complete ass.  Fucking Dugout Dug always shows his face.  Yeah.  He always says, he never hides behind, you understand what I mean?  It's like, I don't know.  That's the only thing, and this is all message boards.  The only thing I don't like about them is the way they languish in anonymity without  the fucking balls to show their face.  So if people are going to argue in a message board chat room like this, which is basically  what it is, it's a message board with video cameras.  There was somebody last night that posted, and this got me to post. 
[00:56:30]  I wasn't even going to post, but this one got me where I had to.  And it said that the Pal Talk people, pretty much, I'll sum it up, pathetic, no lives, spending  all their time talking to little square people that they think are their friends.  It was that theme was the whole thing on Wackbag.  And I had to post, I said, coming from somebody with 3,040 posts here on Wackbag.  Dude, the guy's bashing Pal Talk had over 3,000 posts on Wackbag. 
[00:57:00]  He said, maybe you should shut your yap about what people are doing on the internet and with  the type of people that makes them.  Do you have a picture of his real face?  I don't even know who you mean.  No, no.  No, of course not.  Of course not.  God forbid people should fuck it, and I don't know why that's such a big sticking point with  me, but man, when people say shit as who they are, I have so much more respect for them  than when they fucking hide behind a name that is not theirs and no accountability. 
[00:57:30]  Well, what we do pretty much makes it, it forces us to show who we are.  They know who we are and what we're saying and we're accountable for it.  And then it's so easy to see somebody with, like, two posts because they just signed on  under some assumed name with no picture to just, you know, bash the shit out of you and  then go away.  Because they can't, they just won't show their face.  It's just such a fucking, it's just such a faggot's way of doing this.  It really takes whatever point they're trying to make and flushes it right down the toilet 
[00:58:00]  because if you're not willing to back it up with who you are, then how much can you really  believe in it?  And I'm not addressing any particular issue.  I'm actually just generalizing.  I'm not thinking of one.  Hey, there's 20 issues a week that come up that people do that.  All those posts about Eric and how he sucks, I'm tired of them.  Right.  Hey, while we're backing up, can we back up?  And, Fan, put your face on those posts.  Can we back up even further?  Ooh, let's go. 
[00:58:30]  Reverse.  Sure.  The Rackin' Turs.  At the Hit Factory.  Enough about the moose.  Enough about the Rackin' Turs.  Would you forget the Rackin' Turs, Arthur?  You must have hated us Rackin' Turs.  Pronunciation key, Rackin' Tur, right?  It would be Rackin' Tur, according to the fine, fine internet.  The always accurate internet.  Maybe Wicklund was right and the band says it wrong. 
[00:59:00]  Huh?  Maybe Wicklund was right, Turs, and the band says it wrong.  Well, yeah.  Still don't have an answer.  Possibly not.  As I stand there with no mic and he's snapping photos.  Good.  Good.  You really gotta speak up, Jimmy.  No, I...  You really do.  I always come across as the bad guy, but the heat coming off you last night, you know,  you gotta address it.  I'm telling you, you were so pissed off.  In the moment, you can't.  And then people are listening to the show going, of course, Ops, you know, gotta babble about this. 
[00:59:30]  But I'm sticking up for Jimmy this time.  He was livid.  I would rather just...  The only reason he stuck around was to hopefully get a picture with Jack White.  And also, I didn't want to fucking walk out in the middle of it.  That's just tacky.  I wanted to wait till the interview was done.  Yeah, but you were leaning up against the wall, I heard.  Just kind of hanging out.  Well, out of the way.  I mean, again, once that was done, whatever, I left.  That had to be done after.  The interview you guys are doing, it's, you know, take care of business first.  All right.  Well, part of the deal with the whole Hit Factory, Rackin' Tours, Jack White's new band, 
[01:00:00]  was that we would get to play a recording of one of the songs they did last night, right?  Yeah.  So we're like, well, at least we got an exclusive.  We got some live Rackin' Tours.  They really haven't even toured yet.  They played one show, I think, over in Europe, and they're playing New York, I think, what,  this weekend?  Sold out in like 30 seconds.  Yeah.  It was an exclusive.  So this is a very cool thing to have. 
[01:00:30]  Jack White has a brand new band, and we got a live recording.  Yeah.  And that was part of the deal.  Like, you guys will get to play one of the songs they played last night on your fine radio  show, blah, blah, blah, giving you a little heat, right?  So we go to break all confident.  Like, well, you know, we talked about all the troubles we had last night, but at least we got  this fine recording.  At least we have a song.  Which makes it all worthwhile.  If one good thing could come out of the experience last night, it will be an exclusive song.  Did anyone else out there notice that we had to fade out the exclusive song? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Did you notice?  We weren't giving you a piece.  We were going to give you the whole song.  As the...  Because sometimes it's cool to play a song on this show.  As the song slowly sunk into a giant Maxwell house can.  Well, it started off okay.  Yeah.  And then what?  The bass dropped out?  Totally.  And then everything dropped out? 
[01:01:30]  Like, it sounded like it was being played through a cell phone?  Or, I don't know.  Yeah, it was like all of a sudden, oh, the mic's talking.  Cell phone.  Just get a cell phone on it.  That's all we need.  And we point out our faults because there's nothing else we can do.  Because if we don't, we look like complete assholes.  Yes, we do.  At least if we goof on ourselves, maybe, maybe it helps us a bit. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  We are so pathetic.  So, let's start off nice.  Thank you.  This is from last night.  Steady as she goes, right?  I'm hearing some bottom end on this.  The Wrecking Tears.  So far, so good, right?  Right. 
[01:02:30]  Find yourself a girl and settle down.  So far, so good.  So, steady as she goes. 
[01:03:00]  Your breath was on a kick in a single night.  You had too much to think.  Now you need a wife.  Steady as she goes.  Steady as she goes.  All right.  Steady as she goes.  Steady as she goes.  Steady as she goes.  Steady as she goes.  Well, here we go again.  You found yourself a friend.  I called you out.  Now the vocals are starting to squeeze into.  I don't know what you do.  You're always seen as though you're just as if I'm out. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, steady as she goes.  Now it's just transistor radio.  Listen to this.  This is how Grandpa used to listen to the Mets.  You have completed what you thought you had to do.  And you're just defeated through the poor stable crew.  Here we are.  The show you love.  I just can't even get this right.  You can't even get it all.  It just got worse. 
[01:04:00]  Steady as she goes.  Steady as she goes.  Where should we go again?  You're trying to tell the fact that no new world.  How bad does it get?  Now it sounds like Jack White is holding his nose.  Listen.  Yeah.  You're always seen as though you did that to me.  It's getting worse and worse.  How great is this?  How great is this?  How great is this? 
[01:04:30]  How great is it?  Can it get to the point where we just don't hear it anymore?  Where dogs start tilting their heads?  We haven't touched the volume or anything.  It's not the actual recording that was handed to us to play on our show.  It sounds like the XM traffic channels. 
[01:05:00]  Listen to this.  We haven't touched the volume.  We haven't done anything.  This is the actual recording.  We're down to ping.  Ping.  Ping.  Ping.  Ping.  Is that a symbol?  There's still a minute left on the song, by the way.  This isn't a fade out.  Oh, is that funny? 
[01:05:30]  This is what Ben hears every minute of every day.  It's now just a hiss.  30 seconds left in the song.  This is not a fade out.  There it is, the hiss.  That was the fade right there.  How does something degrade like that so slowly?  Like, doesn't something usually just cut off?  Like, someone would have to screw with a fader, or something has to degrade. 
[01:06:00]  No more.  This is so brilliant on our part.  By the way, that song is fantastic just the way it is.  And that was actually like, that sounded like an audio recording of Steve Martin's movie career.  You know why that is so brilliant on our part?  Because we just went off on a rant about Radio 101, how the people around us lack logic.  Right.  And then you got people, and I know, they're rolling their eyes like, here go open hand again, talking to bed about this man, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:06:30]  Right?  So, then the next thing we do after that rant is like, well, at least we got this.  At least we can play a song.  At least we got this.  And then it goes on to prove exactly what we just said to everybody.  That's funny.  Why wouldn't this be checked to the point to make sure the fucking thing plays through?  Oh my god, is that great?  I am speechless.  I really am.  It's like, it's fucking mind-boggling. 
[01:07:00]  It's just ridiculous.  That was part of the deal.  We would get a nice recording of them doing, you know, the first single, Steady As She Goes.  And I kind of like the beginning of that.  It's a great 30-second song.  I would have liked to have heard the rest of that.  But there you go.  Because I know there are some people, you know, they know who they are.  They're rolling their eyes because we're bitching and complaining.  God damn. 
[01:07:30]  I've never heard a song.  I've never seen a fucking song come apart like that.  The fucking way the gook sings.  He's singing at you, man.  There you go.  We're singing for Manny.  Sal.  Well, I don't even know why the listeners listen to us at this point.  Beyond me.  I don't understand myself because we can't get anything right. 
[01:08:00]  Once they have short arms, she'll get me a fucking...  There it goes.  Maybe a nice fork.  Steady As She Goes, right into the door.  Nice throw-o-pee.  The intern went and got me, like, coffee and a muffin, which was very nice.  But he didn't get me a fork, probably because he would poke his eye every time he leaned in to grab a fork out of that bin.  He's goofing on his little arms.  Look how short.  He's got little arms.  Yeah.  He probably kept hitting his little forehead on the napkin dispenser. 
[01:08:30]  No one would help him.  So there you go.  There you go.  Another Opie and Anthony disaster.  Exclusive disaster.  It's just terrific.  Just terrific radio.  What did Jimmy get?  I had a medium iced latte.  What's in the bag?  It's a low-fat cinnamon muffin.  Why?  Let me look at it.  That looks good.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  I need one immediately.  But that's not low-fat. 
[01:09:00]  It's lower-fat than low-fat.  It's lower-fat.  Yeah.  It's okay.  I want some sugar.  It's still fatty.  I need one, and I have no money on me.  I got money.  Someone make it work.  Hey, get out.  Opie.  All right.  I'll give you money.  I had to borrow $20 from Keith last night to get my car out of parking.  I got money.  I have not been to the ATM.  Hey, the pictures are up from last night's Hit Factory disaster, by the way.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  You go to opianthony.com.  Yeah, you can see us standing awkwardly trying to talk to the band, and oh, wow. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  I didn't know you had all the pictures up already.  Cool.  Anyway, there you go.  Steady as she goes.  So, just in case some of the staff thought we were bitching too much, well, we just proved  our point with that recording.  There you go.  There you go.  I'd love to know what happened there.  I don't know.  Maybe Steve could give us an explanation.  I'd love to know who thinks that we're bitching too much.  Huh?  I'd love to know who thinks that you're bitching too much or we're bitching too much.  I'd love to know.  You know.  You know. 
[01:10:00]  You know you.  You know.  People that have no idea that they're incompetent.  Right?  Those are the ones that, you know, think you're bitching too much are the ones that are, they  have no idea they're incompetent.  Yeah.  Think about it.  Makes sense to me.  I guess it's fair that they wouldn't have much of an idea.  If you're incompetent, you pretty much don't know it.  If you're incompetent.  You can't go, wow, am I incompetent or else you'd fix it. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  So you're just incompetent.  Am I telling a lie?  Skip through life with your shoelaces untied.  No, because you could be incompetent and know it and be incapable of fixing it mouthful  of food.  All right.  A lot of people saying that might have been done intentionally.  Maybe the band didn't want to live record the song out, but that's not the point I'm making.  So the sound guy, like, gets the beginning good and then slowly turns it into a hissy  mess.  But why not one guy around here or not one guy down at the studio would let us know that 
[01:11:00]  this is exactly what happened?  I was handed that song saying, here you go, here's a nice recording of one of the songs  they did last night at the Hit Factory.  That's all I knew.  And I assume, stupid me, once again, that it would be fine all the way through.  Is there a studio version of that?  Yeah.  XM's been playing it like crazy.  Oh, okay.  Just wondering.  I'm sure it's being played on Ethel.  Just wondering if we should have downloaded it illegally and played it.  Well, no. 
[01:11:30]  That's the studio version, though.  Yeah, I got you.  I mean, we had a nice live recording.  It's always cool to hear live recordings.  Not always, but...  Right up until it hisses.  All right.  We have breaking news with Katie Couric.  Yeah, she is leaving the Today Show.  Katie Couric is leaving the Today Show.  She's going to CBS.  She's going to be the anchor.  Yeah.  The history-making anchor.  Yeah.  In the news.  Yeah.  Great.  Wonderful.  I don't think she's got what it takes to be an anchor. 
[01:12:00]  What, she can't read?  National anchor.  She shouldn't have that trust factor, the dignity that it takes.  She's done too many goofy things on the Today Show to gain the respect that it takes.  Someone like Tom Brokaw was a great national anchor.  Couldn't speak worth a shit, but at least, you know, he didn't do anything.  I'm here with giant sunglasses on my head.  I'm here dressed as Halloween.  I am dressed like Elvira, and the black guy on the show is just like a California raisin, and I'm just having a pisser over here. 
[01:12:30]  You know, you never saw him doing that.  There's plenty of clips of Katie looking like an idiot for the Today Show.  You know, it's not like she can just now step into the role of anchor.  You are so right.  Thank you.  And you know what sucks about that?  The other networks.  We'll never, ever be anchors.  Well, that's fine.  But the other networks don't have the balls to just like get a whole montage of her looking completely ridiculous. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, imagine that.  NBC, ABC.  Here's our anchor, and you show them all respectable with his suit on and his voice and blah, blah, blah.  And this is what the other guys have, and just have a montage of her being dumb.  Dressed up like friggin'-  Do you think they have the balls to do like a smear campaign?  When she dressed like Matt Lauer, and Matt dressed like Katie?  Right.  Yeah, show that clip.  Right.  And then show, you know, Brian Williams.  With his fucking face, Mr. Potato Face. 
[01:13:30]  Brian Williams' face does not line up properly.  His eyes are fucking like, one eye is over the mouth and the nose, and the other eye is set somewhere over this fucking right thigh.  He is a disaster.  He's the best one out of the three right now.  All right, Brian.  Yeah, this cold, crooked face.  Know who I like?  The blonde, fat chick on MSNBC that, oh my God, the girl that can't talk.  She's got half her vocal cords missing or something.  Yeah, what's her name?  Jack Klugman?  Who is she?  I watch her because I'm amazed that she's on TV. 
[01:14:00]  I'm just in a top spot, too.  Rita Crosby.  Rita Crosby.  Rita Crosby.  Something like that.  Rita Crosby.  I watch because I'm convinced she's going to go, she's going to fade out like that song.  Right.  It's just going to the middle of the broadcast.  We're going to...  She's got...  She's only got half her vocal cords or something, and we have to make believe we're not noticing  this.  It's uncomfortable and tiring to watch because it looks like she's struggling through the 
[01:14:30]  whole cast.  It looks like she should be exhausted by the end of the broadcast.  I'm trying to think of a top story so we can do a little Rita Crosby.  Today in the news, we'll be talking about the bird flu and how it's going to affect people  in the country.  It comes over here.  A lot of people in Asia have been getting the bird flu.  We're going to talk about it on this broadcast.  Join me, Rita Crosby, to talk about the bird flu. 
[01:15:00]  Is it Rita?  Yeah.  What's her name, man?  Yeah, Rita Cosby.  Rita Cosby?  Rita Cosby.  I was saying Crosby.  That's fucking Crosby.  I don't know.  Crosby.  It's Danny.  Yes, I go.  In entertainment news, Katie Grant.  Entertainment news taking over the anchor slot, and CBS News is going to be former to the  show, Katie Grant. 
[01:15:30]  She's a wreck.  Oh, my God.  Can she just not even speak?  She's my favorite, though.  I just love watching that dumb shit.  We are definitely going to have to get some clips of her, because she is like the new Tara  Reed.  Cannot speak.  Yeah, we're going to have to try to find some Rita Cosby.  Yeah, she's good.  Where is she?  Yeah, SNBC?  I think.  Right?  Yeah.  9 p.m.  9 p.m.  Weeknights, yeah.  Yeah, but I don't think Katie's got that credibility factor to be a national anchor. 
[01:16:00]  Too much goofy shit in her past.  I don't think you need the credibility anymore, though.  I don't know.  I think it helps.  I think it really does help.  You get somebody in there, even that Brian Williams, you know?  Does he have any goofy past?  I don't know.  He's good, though.  He's good.  I don't know.  He might look goofy.  Yeah.  You know, but I never stopped anyone.  Why not?  He's been there.  I think he had a little bit of a war correspondent record going for him. 
[01:16:30]  Sorry.  God damn it.  I hate when the listeners trump us with the obvious.  Dave in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, I hope you take it hard, but, dude, I haven't laughed that hard in a long fucking  time.  It was great.  But are they billing the Racketeurs as the Incredible Shrinking Band?  You know, there was a crowd of listeners standing in front, so we couldn't see the  band, really.  Perhaps as they played the song, they were shrinking. 
[01:17:00]  And that guy was so confident, he said his line.  He didn't even say goodbye.  He was out.  I'm out.  He knew he had a home run.  He pulled a Costanza.  God, is that funny, man.  He left.  The visual.  Holy crap.  The Incredible Shrinking Band.  What a fucking disaster last night.  And then on top of it, because we had a late night, we're tired now.  Now, exhausted.  I'm still trying to catch up on the goddamn Sopranos, and I'm falling asleep.  Anyway, so Katie Couric finally made the announcement on the Today Show. 
[01:17:30]  Thank you.  Anthony, for the people that weren't watching TV this morning, because they were too busy  listening to this horse shit.  Now, relax.  What?  Hey, I told you we could relax.  What?  When did they tell you that?  In October of 2004?  Well, yeah, he's been, Ben's been doing a great job for us, definitely lately, but he did 
[01:18:00]  come in here in a little bit of a panic, trying to, trying to, uh, clear his, uh, reputation.  That would have loved it, mate.  I told us I was trying to, uh, engineer.  Anyway, hopefully the next one will be a lot smoother.  I'm sure it'll be fantastic.  Boston, I can't wait to see what type of an abortion that is.  Oh, Boston, I'll give you the first part of the abortion, is the fact that we're up  there on Easter Sunday, and no one brought it to our attention.  And no one brings it to our attention.  My family's gonna kill me. 
[01:18:30]  And then they, and I brought it up in the office yesterday, because I, I don't know when  Easter is.  Is it on the same day every year?  No.  It's one of those holidays.  It's one of those floating holidays.  It floats like Jesus our Lord.  It's not like, you know, Christmas, everyone knows.  It's Easter.  It could be, it could be in March, it could be in April, I don't know when the fuck it  is.  By the way, Mom, I'm not gonna be there for Easter.  Right, so.  Might as well make the announcement.  So, someone got the bright idea that it's completely logical, the word of the day, Radio 
[01:19:00]  101, that the guys would be fine with, uh, you know, going to Boston Easter Sunday to  broadcast Monday.  Great.  That's stupid me.  I'm like, I, I just assumed, and here, I, I will call myself stupid again.  You know what happens.  I just assumed that there's no way that, uh, you know, it would be around Easter.  No.  And I found out yesterday, because I finally decided to look at a calendar, I'm like, wait  a minute, Easter?  Who would, who would even bring this to, who would even try to set this up? 
[01:19:30]  Here's the beauty of it, too.  We could go to Boston any week, any day, it doesn't matter.  Right.  We could come up with an excuse to broadcast from Boston or anywhere else.  Mm-hmm.  So why is it important to be up there, uh, Easter Sunday?  Because it's the marathon day, and the, and the, and the Red Sox are playing, and. . .  On Monday?  On Monday, I guess.  Well, we were giving the whole weekend there.  But we gotta be up there early.  I spent the whole Friday, Saturday, Sunday in that hotel.  It was like a perk.  Ah, you spent a nice weekend in the hotel. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, but you can't leave Easter Sunday.  Then they took that away from us.  Now, Friday is gone, because they're cutting back.  That's good, because I would have booked a fucking weekend somewhere, and made some money,  and gone up on Sunday and broadcast Monday.  Yeah.  Now, I'm thinking I have a nice weekend away in Boston, and now the Friday hotel is gone,  because they're cutting back.  Right.  I can think of a couple of other ways to cut back, besides a Friday hotel.  Oh.  A salary or two, maybe.  Opie and Anthony?  No.  Oh.  No, the whole company could go to the hotel for a month. 
[01:20:30]  Well.  Yeah.  Well.  That's all.  Good point, good point.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Trying to eat my cake and make me laugh.  Why don't they fire Hawk?  No offense, Hawk, but maybe they could stay there, and then I could get a few, maybe an  extra meal in the hotel.  There you go.  Hawk would not be the first person I'd fire.  No?  Nope.  Wow.  Who would you fire first in here?  Ooh. 
[01:21:00]  Who would get the boot first?  So, all right, Steve.  All second.  Gentlemen.  Steve has handed me the rack and tires.  Steady as she goes.  Perfect burn verified.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  I'm looking at a audio program.  I'm looking at an awful shirt.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  And played it for Derek, played it for Ben, exactly what I was looking at in the studio,  and it's fine.  I just reburned it, and it sounds fine.  Checked it in my studio.  It sounds fine. 
[01:21:30]  I have no idea.  We can't figure out what happened when I burned the first disc.  Yeah.  Well, I think you might want to think about it as you're collecting unemployment.  Really?  Jimmy will get that room.  Ooh, what can I do with it?  Ooh, like in a Sabbath room.  Yeah, but now no one wants to hear that song.  She knows.  I mean, we know.  She knows.  We've already heard it.  It's steady.  It's the funniest version ever.  Ever.  Why would we want to play the normal version now?  The incredibly shrinking band.  Incredible shrinking raconteur.  That will freaking make me laugh all day. 
[01:22:00]  Raconteur is French for shrinking.  As in the Opie and Anthony staff is shrinking.  Who would you boot first?  Who's out of here first?  I would say, even though I like him, Travis has to go.  Travis?  We're not paying him anything.  You want to get rid of big salaries.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe a couple of small salaries then.  Start with Travis.  Get rid of who's next.  I don't know if I'd start with Travis.  He'd certainly go.  I just don't know if I'd start with it. 
[01:22:30]  I say Travis and...  No, Derek makes it look like he's doing something.  By the way, I have no clue what you do.  I see like Travis even is highlighting things in the morning.  Than?  Than's just generally funny.  Yeah, Than can't go.  I see him viewing videos in the morning.  Don't know what you do with him.  He does come up with some bits and sound clips. 
[01:23:00]  That's true.  Okay.  Derek seems to be the guy that backs up E-Rock when he fucks up.  So I guess you are busy.  That deserved more than a guy.  That was very funny.  That's all right.  People were just in stunned silence of hearing the truth.  And plus, Derek always is very comfortable wearing the shoes of a homosexual.  Those fucking open-toed abominations he wears.  They fucking have me a sleet stack handle the phone. 
[01:23:30]  It's fucking creepy.  No, it's great.  Vacation is obviously over.  Oh, my God.  Yesterday, everyone, except for a slight shot at E-Rock.  Oh.  Yeah.  Everyone was so nice to each other.  Oh, I know.  Looks like you went away, too.  Hey, looking good.  Where'd you go?  Well, I went to Key Largo.  Well, you have a good time.  Well rested.  And one day later, we're right back into the shed.  Vicious.  Feeling shitty about yourself, so tear into someone else.  Well, who'd you fire first? 
[01:24:00]  I mean, who didn't salivate at that thought?  Oh, I know.  Oh, just to hurt someone.  They're all a good bunch of fellas.  All right, so.  That's what I say.  So, Katie Carrick, here's her big announcement.  She's leaving the Today Show.  She's announcing it, and she's allowed to, like, finish out?  Yeah, until, I guess, May sometime, maybe?  How come TV is...  Is TV like that?  No, here's the problem.  They don't have Meredith signed yet. 
[01:24:30]  Meredith Vieira from The View is going to take over.  Lucky her.  She gets to escape from Star Jones.  All right.  Yeah.  Isn't she...  No, she's not having the tiff with Star.  It's...  What's her name?  Joy Behar.  Joy Behar.  God bless her.  I love Joy Behar.  God bless...  I want Joy Behar on this show so bad.  I met her once through Jimmy and Rich Voss.  They all go back at the Dennis Leary Rose.  Well, actually, Rich goes back. 
[01:25:00]  I've only met her a couple times.  Oh, okay.  And she...  And Rich Voss is coming in today.  And she...  Man, she is a potty mouth, man.  Yeah.  She is playing a role on The View.  And she is...  She's the edgy one on The View, granted.  But in real life, she is so much dirtier.  And she's funny.  I watched her do stand-up one time.  She is really funny.  Opening for New Heart.  And she was...  Years ago, I went to see him at Carnegie.  And she was fucking hilarious as a stand-up.  I'd never seen her.  I just heard her.  I'm like, ugh, who the fuck is she?  And damn it, she was really good on that.  Yeah, most broad comics suck.  Atta boy.  And most broad comedy critics do, too. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, we'll get into that in a second.  DC Idiots.  We'll get to that in a second.  The View, though, I know the show I watch every day because I can't...  It's a disaster in the making.  Star Jones.  Star Jones wants to be the next Oprah so bad.  She wants to have her own show.  So bad.  And it's never, ever going to happen.  She's undergoing all types of surgery and everything to try to bang that body into shape.  And Joy Behar, you know, lets her have it here and there.  Yeah.  Here and there. 
[01:26:00]  You know, Joy's smart.  She wants to keep jobs, so she...  Keep the gig.  She picks her shots.  Star Jones, she should be assaulting a police officer walking into the House of Representatives.  Fucking fat whore.  We have yesterday's papers.  Rosie O'Donnell, who, uh...  Is it Dyke?  Well, I love her or hate her.  She's doing that cruise thing on HBO.  You know how she...  What?  Oh, she does the Dyke cruise?  The Dyke cruise.  They filmed it this year.  Nice.  She does a Dyke cruise every year with her and her partner and then other same-sex couples. 
[01:26:30]  It must be handy for everybody to go out on a deck on a windy day and not have to worry  about fixing their hair when they go back inside.  You know?  Not a brush on that boat.  But I guess it's going to be on HBO.  They taped this year's Dyke cruise or what have you and...  What is it called?  I'm sure it's called something else.  I'm almost certain.  That's not the official name of it.  The Dyke cruise.  The Dyke cruise.  Are there fag guys on there, too? 
[01:27:00]  Or is it just lesbos?  Same-sex couple.  Jesus.  That could be the worst way I've ever heard that.  Are there fag guys on there, too, or just lesbos?  Well, Jesus.  What, you want us to start sugarcoating stuff around here?  It was the old terminology.  I wanted to see his little hand come up like Norman Fell and do the Tinkerbell side.  Here it is.  Here it is.  All aboard.  Rosie's family cruise.  All aboard.  She should be on her back with her face like that and a bunch of vaginas lined up.  It's on tomorrow night on your new network there, Jimmy. 
[01:27:30]  HBO.  Well, I like Rosie because she fucking, when you talk about Michael Jackson, she's like,  I didn't talk to him because I don't say hello to pedophiles.  Rosie is kind of like a real bitch since she left her show.  Yeah.  Well, she was, you know, the queen of nice for so long, and apparently that wasn't true.  Do we have Monday's papers?  The family vacation O'Donnell style, it's like the alternative version of a family.  Is that what they're talking about?  Is she trying to build this as a dyke cruise, or is it like anyone can go? 
[01:28:00]  Like some poor unsuspecting family goes on this thing because they think Rosie is like  the Rosie of 1997 or something.  Right.  The fake Rosie.  The fake Rosie.  She was so funny on the show.  I bet, you know, we'll take me, you, the kids, and I'll bet you we'll have a Koosh Ball fight.  It'll be wonderful.  There's probably pictures of Tom Cruise hanging all over because she loves Tom Cruise.  Totally forgetting the past ten years she's been munching rug. 
[01:28:30]  Look at her in her little admiral uniform.  Oh, it's just admiral O'Donnell.  Admiral O'Donnell.  She tasks me.  Or it'll be some guy goes on a cruise thinking he's going to pick up some chicks.  And they'll be like, wow, everyone I hit on has a mullet.  Hey, you, the chick with Jeff Foxworthy hair.  Bunch of flatzos.  Yeah.  Flatzos.  There's got to be more on this. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, well, we're going to tape it.  It's on tomorrow night.  But Rosie O'Donnell had a hilarious comment about Star Jones in Monday's paper.  I meant to cut it out, and I forgot.  Did it have the N-word in it?  And it wasn't as hysterical as it could have been?  Did it mention luggage?  Did it mention Naomi Watson?  Oh, all aboard.  Maybe you can find that. 
[01:29:30]  Thank you, no.  Thank you, no.  Oh, okay, here it is.  This might be it.  What?  There's got to be some clips or something.  We have started like three or four different topics here, but it's all going to come around.  We do.  Pay attention, people.  It's like Pulp Fiction, this show.  All right, let's see.  It all ties up sometime.  Yeah, and we all get shot.  We all get shot, and someone gets fucked in the ass.  Yes.  That's not the one.  Tom Brokaw is talking to Art Buckwalt, by the way. 
[01:30:00]  If we could pot that up.  Love to hear a little Tom Brokaw.  Let's see.  No?  It talks about her.  Can we?  Walk up.  Oh, you had to start potting something up for those teeth.  Got to hear it.  And be a celebrity.  Talking with Art Buckwalt.  Some people try to talk you out of that.  Yes.  My family did, and then also my friends did.  You smell like a bass.  And that was a decision that I took to make, and my doctor said, it's your choice. 
[01:30:30]  And that's what helped a lot.  What have you learned from all of us?  He should play Leon Klinghoffer on the all-aboard cruise.  First of all, how many friends I really had.  That's a real thing that very few people have a chance to know.  Or Art Buckwalt is wheelchair-bound.  The second thing I learned is how wonderful these people are in hospice.  How well they take care of you.  As a former foster child. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, that time is a bitch.  As a former foster child.  This is one of the bones that Rowan broke out.  They let him do a few of these a year.  What happened to his fucking hair?  I don't know.  He all of a sudden looks real old.  Yeah, it's like a real Bob's Big Boy hairdo.  It's annoying.  What happened?  Well, he doesn't have to try to stay young for the network.  Or younger.  All right, where were we?  I don't know.  You were looking at something?  Oh, you were plugging Poughkeepsie this weekend, Friday and Saturday.  Oh, right. 
[01:31:30]  Okay.  Yeah, Jim Norton's going to be in Poughkeepsie at Bananas all weekend long, right?  Ooh.  Ah, wait.  Ah, no.  Bananas.  All right.  So we'll try to find the Rosie O'Donnell clip.  That's where we're at.  Yeah.  She had some really, really biting comments about Star Jones.  Ow.  Made me laugh, actually.  Basically saying why isn't Star Jones being honest, which also makes me laugh that it's coming from Rosie O'Donnell.  Exactly.  But then she had some really funny things to say.  What's the honesty thing?  Well, she basically said that Star Jones is married to a gay guy. 
[01:32:00]  And then talked about how she talks on The View about having self-control.  Like they had some kind of cookies that they were trying out.  Self-control?  Self-control.  And she took one cookie and said to the rest of The View cast, I'm only going to take one because I have self-control.  And Rosie O'Donnell's like, are you kidding me?  You had your stomach stapled.  Yeah.  And then talks about the way she poops.  But I don't know exactly what she said.  But it was really funny.  So I don't want to misquote her.  Did it involve flinging it at people? 
[01:32:30]  Right.  All aboard.  Oh, that and Leon Klinghofer.  Oh, he wheeled him right off.  He was so needless.  What's the sun on the deck?  Some Palestinian pushing him into the ocean.  Some savage pushes him right off. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, you think he was trying to lock his wheel?  Yeah.  You just heard him.  Skid, skid, skid, skid.  He had to cross that teak deck.  Isn't there railing around this whole thing?  That one opening.  Oy vey.  Oh.  Poor bastard.  Trying to hold on to your fucking hold on.  Oh.  What do they call the little arm things?  Little arm things.  Little arm things.  Don't know.  All right.  Well, this is where we're at.  Katie Couric made the big announcement today. 
[01:33:30]  But yes, she's leaving the Today Show.  I guess this is the appropriate time for me to share my future plans.  I wanted to tell all of you out there who have watched the show for the past 15 years  that after listening to my heart and my gut, two things that have served me pretty well  in the past, I've decided I'll be leaving today at the end of May.  It was really a very difficult decision for a lot of different reasons.  First of all, because of the connection I feel with you.  I know I don't know the vast majority of you personally, and it may sound kind of corny, 
[01:34:00]  but I really feel as if we've become friends through the years.  No, we haven't.  And you've been with me during a lot of good times and some very difficult ones as well,  and hopefully I've been there for you.  Your friends were so hating black watermen.  I can't tell you how grateful I am for the support you all have given me  and so appreciative that you've included me in your morning routines.  Another reason that this decision was so difficult is my relationships with the people on this wonderful show.  And I'm thinking about the crew and the control room and all my friends at NBC across the street. 
[01:34:30]  You know, the notion that we're a family is not just some cheesy promotional device.  I really care deeply about the people here, from everyone who works behind the scenes  to the faces that are familiar to all of you, like Al and Ann and, yes, of course, Matt.  Once in a while, we get on each other's nerves.  Well, he gets on my nerves.  That's funny.  But I could not have asked for a more talented partner or better friend.  And just as Dorothy said to the Scarecrow, I think I'm going to miss him most of all. 
[01:35:00]  It's been second line for the world.  Too bad the Scarecrow didn't say back, beat it already, cunt.  You're annoying me.  That's what you quote?  I think I'm going to miss him most of all?  Why did you quote Burt Lahr so Big Kemp could feel good?  That's right, stupid.  I just attack you unprovoked.  She said something horrible about Al Roker, though.  Yeah? 
[01:35:30]  Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  But that was early in her tenure there.  Yeah, the voice is a little different, I noticed.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Like Dorothy said about the Scarecrow.  Oh, that's awful.  And when Al first saw Katie on her first day.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Yeah.  It was like Dorothy said to the Scarecrow, hey, the spook lost a few pounds over the break.  I just have a tough time with, like, people saying goodbye. 
[01:36:00]  It's just so corny.  If it's real, I don't mind.  It's so corny.  It was a great goodbye to Mary Tyler Moore when they all hugged because they were really  crying and they were really sad.  Aw, shut the lights to the studio out.  That was actually a really good goodbye.  Yeah, they were really, they really were sad.  I mean, they were, you know, it was a funny moment.  The mash goodbye?  That was, yeah, it was great.  With what's-his-name, with the thing.  One guy in B.J.  He wrote it.  Yeah, it was awful.  Awful. 
[01:36:30]  The New Heart dream sequence was very funny ending.  Genius.  Very funny.  But that's not a real goodbye.  That's kind of a, well, yeah.  That's one of the most brilliant ever.  Good ending.  Greatest goodbye ever, Anthony.  Goodbye or end of a show?  Last show.  Keep saying goodbye to our viewers.  Greatest goodbye ever doesn't have to be necessarily a TV program.  Oh, my God.  It has to be an O&A when we got fired.  Oh, that's right.  We didn't get to say goodbye. 
[01:37:00]  Your mom's box.  That's a good goodbye.  I would have to say Lou Gehrig.  That's the one I have.  Oh, wow.  That's the one I had.  Greatest goodbye ever.  Oh, luckiest, man.  You can't, you can't.  How many people get to say it in front of 70,000 people in the same area?  But he was lying.  Yeah, how lucky?  Not lucky.  That's not true.  That's stunk.  That's not lucky at all.  I am a bitter motherfucker.  Right.  I have a great career here.  Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today, one bitter motherfucker. 
[01:37:30]  I have a great career, and it's being taken away by some fucking disease so new, it's named  after me, the guy that got it.  Lucky, go shit in your head.  I stand before you, probably the most unlucky motherfucker on the face of the earth.  If I was a coal miner and I got this disease, I'd still be unlucky. 
[01:38:00]  Lucky, I'm a fucking baseball player, one of the best ever, and I'm being cut down by  a disease with no name.  They couldn't even figure it out.  What have you got?  I said to the doctor, Doc, what do I got?  He said, I don't have a clue.  Lucky?  What are you going to, what is it?  Lou Gehrig's disease.  You got it.  Now it's yours. 
[01:38:30]  Couldn't be something they had a cure for.  So I stand before you here, one pissed off, bitter motherfucker.  Fucker.  Fucker.  Holy shit.  It was a great goodbye, though.  I'll tell you, another goodbye that was actually really good.  I don't know if you heard the Robert Reed goodbye, but he said, kids, you're not going 
[01:39:00]  to believe this.  Crunk.  I stand before you, the most...  I consider myself the skinniest man.  I stand before you, a real gay guy that was tempted by your young boys. 
[01:39:30]  Now I can't lift a finger to drink my broth.  My robe is frayed and my dog has no one to take care of him.  And I say, in closing...  Bobby, you remember that time you woke up with your hiney sore and I said, the boogeyman  did it?  Crunk.  Hey, uh, here's the Lou Gehrig...  Here's the Lou Gehrig goodbye.  All right.  Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth. 
[01:40:00]  I might have been given a bad break.  Might have.  But I've got an awful lot to live for.  Thank you.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  It's the new HBO sitcom, Lucky Lou.  But I have an awful lot to live for.  I just got a job as a paint mixer at the hardware store.  Right?  Shakes? 
[01:40:30]  Thank you.  But it's not a shaking disease.  What?  Lou Gehrig's disease?  It just shuts you down.  Isn't it some kind of nervous disorder where you shake?  Shake?  Shake?  No, it just shuts you down.  What does it do?  Do, do, do.  You turn it to cement, basically.  No, stop it.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that when you look at Medusa?  You just stop moving.  Is that it?  Pretty.  I thought you got a little shaky first.  Maybe it starts with a little shake.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wasn't he called like the Iron Man or the...  The Iron Man. 
[01:41:00]  Wow.  How ironic.  He just turned into steel.  Yeah, you pretty much just kind of sat there.  Pretty much just start cramping up.  Like that joke.  Pretty much just start cramping up.  Just froze.  I like your news.  Concrete.  Some famous goodbyes.  Hey, Randy in New York, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  I'm wondering, when Katie becomes an anchor, is she going to be the first anchor to have  a tube up her ass when she's doing her reports?  God, if I was the other network.  That's what I would show.  When her husband died, tragically, of colon cancer, she... 
[01:41:30]  Okay.  That's horrific.  That's horrific.  That's not a...  Who's her husband?  What's the matter?  And when did he die?  I didn't even know.  Mr. Couric.  I don't know.  It was a while ago.  It was about eight years ago, maybe.  Something like that.  And she wanted to bring attention to it.  So, live on the show, she got a colonoscopy.  So, they kind of, you know, gave her a little valium later on her side and gave her the pipe.  I've never watched that show.  Gave her the old pipe.  As far as pop culture goes, it was everywhere. 
[01:42:00]  I don't...  Katie Couric on an all-new house.  Gets a tube up her ass.  I was listening to a house pro the other day.  Oh.  Thinking of you.  Hey, we might have another goodbye here.  Mike in Baltimore.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Um, I got the best goodbye ever.  All right.  Yeah.  It's the, uh, the politician, I think it was in New York.  I forget his name.  Bud Dwyer.  Oh, R. Bud Dwyer.  Bud Dwyer.  Pennsylvania. 
[01:42:30]  He was great.  He was up on some kind of charges.  He called a press conference, brought in a little paper bag with him, um, told everybody  he was sorry, told everyone to get away, pulled the gun out.  Big friggin' gun, too.  Out of a paper bag.  Out of a paper bag.  Shoved it right in his mouth and pulled the trigger in front of everybody.  On live TV, right?  Now there's a goodbye.  That was live TV.  Live TV.  I've seen that video a million times.  It's really uncomfortable.  That's what it looks like when you shoot yourself.  It's just uneventful. 
[01:43:00]  You just sit there and bleed from the mouth and people panic and that's it.  Bleed from everywhere.  Man, that was like a blood waterfall.  I have never seen so much blood.  Ears, nose, eyes, mouth, everywhere.  And then it turns out, years later, they decide he would have been innocent.  Really?  Yeah.  That's how the story ends.  Oops.  Take that back.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Greatest goodbye ever.  Oh, great.  I'd have to say Susan Smith as she waved at the band.  Goodbye.  Say, Mommy. 
[01:43:30]  Where are you going?  Why's Mama waving at us?  Wave back.  Bye-bye, Mommy.  She was waving goodbye and at the same time waving hello to that new room you can use for  whatever you want.  Hello to those new funds.  What's the first thing you do after that?  Go to a diner and eat?  I always wanted dumb stuff like that.  So you're doing this unbelievable thing.  Well, now horrific.  Now you turn away from the scene for the last time and then you just walk away. 
[01:44:00]  What's the first thing you do?  Like, let me check my cell phone and see if anyone called me.  Any messages?  I mean, what do you do?  Like when you're walking away, when you're walking away as they're going underwater, are  you thinking, are they dead yet?  Oh, you have to be.  Are you thinking like, right now my son is drowning?  Right now my son is, like, it's beyond...  Or are you that crazy that you did something like that where it doesn't even bother you?  Like Andrea Yates. 
[01:44:30]  She's just, Andrea Yates is nuts.  Yeah, she did it and called, and called.  Didn't she call her husband first and said, um, I did something very terrible.  And the husband was like, it was the kids?  And she said, yeah, and he knew exactly because it had built up.  Right.  Like, the husband knew what was going to happen eventually.  And he still, you know, trotted off to work.  And then called the cops and said, yeah, well, I killed my kids.  Where Susan Smith tried to hide it, she blamed the black guy. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Black guys because she wanted to, you know, she, she, why is she, has she not been executed?  Why will we not kill him?  We don't really execute people anymore.  For doing that.  I mean, you know, you got Texas that still leads the way, but besides that.  Dude, they have to sit and argue over that Massawi idiot.  Yeah.  How are they going to execute anybody if that guy shouldn't just be put to death?  By the way, somebody sent me a link.  I was asking for 9-11 conspiracy theories.  And they sent your children through? 
[01:45:30]  No, who, what do I want, senior citizens?  Is it good?  That was true.  We would have been talking about April 2nd.  Well, no, it should have been higher.  April 5th, 4th, 5th.  Don't buy him.  Well, please hold.  Thank you.  Continue.  Glub, glub, glub, glub, glub.  Bye-bye.  You're distracted.  You're still annoyed from last night.  Oh, it's beyond belief.  Ka-ching!  Ka-ching!  Ka-ching!  Against the wall.  I could be doing something.  Ka-ching! 
[01:46:00]  Poor Jim.  Is there pictures of you on the website looking all awkward?  I just...  Well, I was against the wall with Steve, so it was like it was only, you know...  Yeah, well, that's where you should be when we're supposed to be interviewing a band.  That makes sense to me, of course.  I was going to say, wait, I forgot something.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, somebody sent me a link for the 9-11 conspiracy, and I think most of them are garbage.  I still don't agree with it.  However, whoever sent me the link for like that hour-long video, I watched like a half hour of it,  it was... it raises a lot of really good questions.  Stop it. 
[01:46:30]  Dude, believe me, I'm fucking Sammy skeptic, and I don't think that it was a conspiracy done by the government.  I do believe they were flown in.  What was the video?  Was it a spinning pinwheel-like device with a boo-woo-woo-woo-woo sound?  Yes.  No, it was not true.  You were hypnotized.  It was...  You've heard all the Pentagon arguments, but when this guy does a photo montage and asks questions,  he gets into what the engines are made out of and what fire...  It was just...  I would need somebody next to me who understood enough about engine... 
[01:47:00]  Like, they showed the engine parts on the ground.  Yeah.  And he goes, this is not the part of a 757.  It's a part of this kind of plane.  And he showed what the part of a 757 would look like,  and what the part of a plane he said it was.  Again, I don't believe it, but I would need an expert next to me to tell me why he's wrong.  I don't either.  When you hear JFK conspiracy, I mean, I believe it was a conspiracy.  Yeah.  But when you have an expert arguing for the Oswald theory, you better know your shit because they can go, no, no, no, this is possible. 
[01:47:30]  I've heard Oswald, like Warren Commission supporters, argue and make you believe, yes, Oswald acted alone.  Like, you understand?  They know what they're talking about that much.  I don't know what I'm talking about enough to debate what he says in this.  It was actually that well done.  I think the conspirators on the 9-11 thing try so hard to come up with any little scrap of discrepancy or evidence like engine parts and this.  You can look at 10 different plane crashes in 10 different circumstances and not get the same results. 
[01:48:00]  Parts look different.  They barely found anything at the Pentagon site as far as a plane goes.  They were – it wasn't a normal crash.  These people were full throttle into structures.  No, no, no, I agree.  And he said that they said that the plane was vaporized.  Yeah.  But he says it's the first time in aviation history and then he gave an example of a plane that hit a mountain doing 550 miles an hour and he goes, this is what you find, engines, things like this. 
[01:48:30]  And he said this is the heat they withstand because they're made of titanium.  He went through all that shit, wing parts.  It's just the way it is when it hits something.  There's something left.  And my only problem with the Pentagon one, and this is the one you've heard before, is it just – there's no mark on the grass that I can see.  Maybe there's a little one, but it's just – I would want an expert to be able to tell me why he's wrong and I would – that's what I would like.  The pictures I saw, it looked like it was a perfect hit, as they say. 
[01:49:00]  It didn't hit the ground first.  It hit the Pentagon.  It hit the wall.  They show the wing mark where the engine hit.  It didn't hit the grass.  And then it vaporized, like you said.  The Pentagon's a big, heavy brick building like that.  I just have a problem with it vaporizing.  And the towers, I can understand, because the intense – I mean, that's tremendous.  The towers actually didn't vaporize the planes as much as the Pentagon did.  There were a lot of pieces that flew right through the building. 
[01:49:30]  The fact that the Pentagon was made of brick like that vaporized the plane.  A lot of it was just gone.  But there were pieces, and they've shown them, that have the logo of the airline on it.  They've got pieces.  I'm not convinced.  I'm sorry.  And if that's the case, a 757 did take off, had some people on it.  Where are they?  Of course.  Of course.  My question is – I completely agree.  They're flying around the 1933 World's Fair looking to land. 
[01:50:00]  I love that Twilight Zone episode.  My question is, and I agree with you, but I want to – it really – he made good points.  I was just looking for somebody to make me go, wow, that's a great point.  And none of them have been able to do that because they're all such agenda-driven idiots.  Where this guy actually went into the physics of certain things, and he may be wrong.  I just don't know enough to argue where he's wrong.  So I think he's just one of the smarter ones that came up with stuff that was probably more convincing than just,  dude, it's a different kind of plane, dude.  No, no, very possible. 
[01:50:30]  But I would like to know – the one thing that bothers me with the Pentagon, and again, maybe somebody has a reason for this,  is they only have those little five photo images, and I know that there really was some kind of surveillance stuff.  It is the Pentagon.  Yeah, you would think at the Pentagon there'd be a lot more caverns.  Don't tell me there was no surveillance.  Everywhere.  Did you ever hear of eyewitnesses as far as that crash goes?  They'd show one guy saying he saw an American Airlines plane coming in.  But it's weird that – I mean –  Another guy said he saw a small, unmarked plane coming in.  All kinds of weird stuff like that.  But unlike the towers where obviously there were so many eyewitnesses – I mean, it was on TV for Christ's sake. 
[01:51:00]  You don't hear about a lot of eyewitnesses as far as the Pentagon thing goes.  Yeah.  And by then, especially – the only problem I have is with the videotape not being found.  I mean, the tower, the first one was just dumb luck that they got.  They happened to be filming and he panned up.  That's true.  Now, somewhere like New York, you have a lot of people with video cameras and stuff like that.  The Pentagon, you're not going to have people walking around with video cameras, really.  Yeah, no, absolutely.  But I mean surveillance.  Very secure.  Yeah, you'd think there'd be more surveillance. 
[01:51:30]  But how many surveillance cameras were at the Trade Center?  There was one.  Most of what we saw from the Trade Center was home video, things like that.  Well, there might have been surveillance cameras that aren't aimed that high.  Don't forget, there's probably surveillance cameras all over, but it would hit 72nd, 90th,  or whatever it was.  So the surveillance cameras would never cover something that high.  But maybe they have it and they just don't want to show us.  That's the problem.  For whatever reason.  And they do have those two frames.  But that's what they want to show you. 
[01:52:00]  Five frames.  It shows nothing.  Five frames.  Yeah, we'll give you these five shots.  That's it.  We'll give you this.  No plane.  For whatever reason.  Maybe they just have a reason why they don't want to show it.  But if they say national security, what, in the interest of national security, could  they possibly be hiding that wood?  You know what I'm saying?  I'd give people little pointers on where to point the plane next time, something like  that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  See, that's just pulled out of my ass, just like conspiracy theorists do.  I'm going to send you this link.  I know you'll watch it.  Send me the link. 
[01:52:30]  It's actually, and again, you may be able to, you probably know more about the physics  than I do.  I just don't know where on certain points.  Send it to Anthony.  I want to hear what Professor Anthony has to say.  I would like to as well.  That's not, but they show like.  No, that's not, that's not the actual crash theory rock.  No, it just, it opens up and it's got some dumb, like little music behind it, which conspiracy  theorists, you're hurting your cause with fucking music behind it.  It's like Wolf Blitzer show.  Stop with a club beat behind it, Wolf.  You're fucking 65.  You're not a hip guy. 
[01:53:00]  No one's tapping their toes to your shitty show.  Rita Cosby doesn't use any music behind her.  I do the straight news with the headlines.  Wolf Blitzer might play some club music behind him, but I'm always just putting on the news.  All right, let's wrap this whole thing together.  We're going to try now.  So we're talking about goodbyes.  All right.  We have the rest of Katie Couric's goodbye.  She's leaving the Today Show to do the news for CBS.  But I could not have asked for a more talented partner or better friend. 
[01:53:30]  And just as Dorothy said to the scarecrow, I think I'm going to miss him most of all.  It's been such an honor and a privilege to occupy this seat for as long as I have.  One of the things I've always appreciated about the Today Show is its rich tradition and its place in history.  In January, it celebrated its 54th anniversary.  Not only was I thrilled that the show is actually older than I am, but I was also reassured that this is an institution that will continue to grow and thrive because of all the extraordinarily dedicated people who work here and care about this show as passionately as I do. 
[01:54:00]  But sometimes I think change is a good thing, although it may be terrifying to get out of your comfort zone.  It's also very exciting to start a new chapter in your life.  So for now, it's not goodbye, at least not yet.  But a heartfelt thank you for 15 great years.  Also coming up in this half hour.  Oh, okay. 
[01:54:30]  That's funny.  Actually, they're being funny for real.  I thought they were just being heartless like they usually are.  In great years.  Also coming up in this half hour.  You've got to give it to her.  That's funny.  It's all right.  Oh, I...  That is really funny.  Talk about mixed emotions.  First of all, I hope you know that everyone here across the street, we feel the same way about you and echo your sentiments.  And mixed emotions because it's hard to imagine being here and not having you sitting next to us. 
[01:55:00]  Boring.  But also, we're thrilled for the fact that you're going to take on a new challenge.  I'm looking.  Did it say anywhere in there about where you're going?  At this point, I'm thinking about opening up a secondhand bookstore in Montana.  If you were a guest on the show, I wouldn't let you get away without saying, so, what are your plans?  I am.  Well, I know it's the worst cup secret in America, but I'm going to be working on the CBS Evening News in 60 Minutes. 
[01:55:30]  And I'm very excited about it.  But I can't tell you how much I'm going to miss everybody.  Well, good news is...  Can I come and visit?  You can come anytime you want.  And the good news is we've got a couple of months to say a proper goodbye.  We're going to have a lot of fun and relive a lot of great moments.  Packing your box more.  You're so sick of being by Andy.  You're going to be like, goodbye already.  What are you doing on 60 Minutes?  Oh, thanks, James.  I'm going to hose out Andy Rooney's prostate.  Let's get a check of the weather for a minute.  I'm going to hose out.  Let's get a check of the weather.  Oh, look at this fucking...  I don't want to say what's...  Oh, my God.  We can't start another topic.  Can we do it when we come back? 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  Please, can we talk about this fucking bitch when we get back?  Of course we can.  That'll be the first thing we do.  I promise you.  I love you.  Because I found the Rosie O'Donnell thing, so we want to wrap that up.  Oh, nice.  And then, see, we wrapped up about three or four topics here.  That's what we've done.  Where's the Rosie?  Where is it?  Why don't I have a copy of the Rosie?  I don't either.  Who's in charge of that?  Thank you, Stan.  No one's in charge here.  Stan did it.  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:30]  It's under my template.  Thank you, Stan.  Stan was right.  We were wrong.  I'm sure that makes you happy.  This made me chuckle yesterday.  A lot to stomach.  Here's what annoys me about Star Jones.  It says, Rosie O'Donnell.  To write a book about how to be the perfect woman that she now is and to leave out gastric bypass and the supposed gender identity issues of your husband is just like selling bullshit to the point that it's sickening.  O'Donnell tells New York Magazine, and she pushed me away. 
[01:57:00]  What?  As she pushed away a plate of Oreos with Joy.  Well, yeah, but that's – and she pushed – how does that make sense?  And she continued.  Like, O'Donnell tells New York Magazine –  Oh, okay, okay.  As she pushed away a plate of Oreos.  All right, so O'Donnell tells New York Magazine, and she pushed away a plate of Oreos with Joy Behar, co-host of The View.  They had new double-stuffed Oreos.  They had to eat, obviously, because they had a Nabisco deal at ABC.  And Star goes, I'll just have one because I have self-control.  And I thought, Joy's going to say it. 
[01:57:30]  She's going to say, you lying sack of shit.  You can only eat one because you poop soup.  Do you know how bad a liquidy Star Jones shit must smell?  Because it probably has, like, those little pieces.  You ever take a liquid shit, and it's got, like, little pieces of, like, what looks like peanut skin in there?  Or a lima bean skin?  Oh, my God.  Just throw a few nuts in it.  Like the diarrhea shit that just go – 
[01:58:00]  All it is, like – it's a liquid coloring in the bowl.  That's what all of her dumps look like.  Oh.  The spray's on the back of your T-shirt.  It's so bad.  No, Star Jones, when she's done shitting, has to lift the toilet seat lid and actually clean under the lid.  You ever shit and spray under the lid?  And you have a chick coming over it, and you've got to scrape it off with your fingernail through a piece of toilet in it?  No, you don't.  And what's our old gag about that?  I always said it looked like you rode your 10-speed bike through a mud puddle. 
[01:58:30]  And you then end up with the back of your T-shirt.  You can only eat one because you poop soup.  That's a great quote.  All right.  So we've got the Homeland Security press secretary – oh, that's another great story, yes.  Yeah, another guy thinking he had a 14-year-old girl.  You want to talk about the black congresswoman thing, right?  Yeah.  We'll do that after the break.  We've got Voss and Bonnie outside the studio as well.  We have Richard and Bonnie.  Richard and Bonnie.  Richard and Bonnie. 
[01:59:00]  Richard and Bonnie.  Or is it Bonnie and Richard?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Bonnie and Voss.  Bonnie and Richard.  I haven't seen them in a while.  The lovely couple.  I miss my friends.  Do you think they're still happy?  No.  I don't think so either.  Not at all.  She's had enough of him already.  Why are they staying together?  Career or something?  Well, she doesn't need him.  Yeah, we know that.  Rich is like Rich is ready to stumble in here.  What were you saying?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  We were saying it's nice to see the lovely couple back on the show. 
[01:59:30]  We love you.  She hasn't been on in a while.  She's been bugging me to get on.  She goes, you know, let's fucking love over there.  You know.  She's more than welcome.  When we were in Chicago, we turned Man Cow down, so, you know, she wants to do radio.  Ah.  You know.  She's always welcome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's definitely always welcome.  Cool.  Yeah.  That's how I roll.  I love you.  That's how I roll.  You know.  All right, well.  Are you going to have a little more energy when we officially introduce you?  No. 
[02:00:00]  Why would I do that?  You still happy being married?  You think we're in commercial?  Happy being married?  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Happy.  I'm happy here.  I'm happy if we're in Cleveland this week.  I'm happy everywhere I'm with her.  Oh, cool.  What Cleveland gig are you doing?  No, no.  Not now.  When you get back.  Everyone here with a little energy.  That's all.  Yeah.  We don't ask for much from you guys.  Just a little energy to help us along, okay?  All right.  You're pissing him.  All right. 
[02:00:30]  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze the bread.  Squeeze the bread.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of it.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The Obi and Anthony show.  In case you didn't know.  That's it.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how. 
[02:01:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony program.  Rich Boston studio with his lovely wife, Bonnie McFarland.  Playing Cleveland this weekend.  Yeah, the Cleveland improv.  We're, we're going to do our acts together this time.  Oh, that's what people, people like, well, uh, you know, email us from my space.  So you guys go on stage together.  Yeah.  All of a sudden we're fucking still in a mirror.  I can't even get her to bang me.  I'm going to get her to do, you know, comedy with me. 
[02:02:00]  It's just unbelievable.  Is the banging way down already?  Oh, it's unbelievable.  That's not true.  Huh?  Well, with us, it is.  Each other.  I still bang.  But, sometimes you're not in the room.  She's so fucking dizzy.  We were in the hotel the other night.  She's so what?  Fucking dizzy.  What?  What do you think I said?  Rich, dizzy.  Yeah, I have an inner ear infection and I, I literally am dizzy.  Oh, all right.  We're in the room.  That's fine.  We were not.  That was a fucking 40s expression.  I know.  Dude, what a dizzy dame. 
[02:02:30]  You know what else he always says?  Dizzy broad.  I hipped you to Diet Coke, didn't I?  He thinks he hipped me to everything.  Hipped you to it.  Stop taking your Lenny Bruce character so seriously.  Listen to me.  Yeah.  We're fucking in on.  And a busy broad.  I hipped her to.  I took her.  I mean, we were in a hotel the other night.  Go on, Daddy.  So the smoke alarm, the smoke alarm's, the smoke alarm's going off.  She goes, can you press the, you know, press the button.  So I go up there and press the button.  I go, your cigarette. 
[02:03:00]  She goes, your cigarette is making a smoke alarm go off.  And next to her on her, next to her on the bed, the little dresser, there's a fucking  towel on fire from her candle.  She's sitting there reading.  And there's a fucking towel on fire.  She's going, you got to put your cigarette out.  No, but like it was still five.  Where were you, bedrock?  Fucking lights.  I think you use a light, but you do have to.  I light a smelly candle because of the cigarette smoke.  Yeah, stop smoking.  Why don't you stop?  Oh, my God, Rich.  Somehow get it.  I don't know how to.  We're not going to your funeral if you die of long cancer. 
[02:03:30]  Why don't you stop?  Well, I didn't think you would.  You didn't go to the wedding.  Why would you go to the funeral?  Imagine that.  Oh, I can't make it that night.  Oh, Rich.  Finally, Patrice and Billy Bird bring a present.  He smashed us.  You're taking that hard stuff.  No, no, I'm not.  I let it go.  We all explained ourselves on our past show.  I let it go.  So, dude, why don't you quit smoking?  I am.  Why?  I'm going to go to a hypnotist.  I just got the link for it. 
[02:04:00]  I just got the link for a hypnotist.  No, not a hypnotist.  What the fuck?  What bullshit answer is that?  Not a hypnotist fucking laser.  You can get laser surgery.  That's a really big difference.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Laser?  Yeah.  To quit smoking?  Yeah, yeah.  What do they do?  Unless they weld your mouth shut.  No, I don't know.  What the fuck do they do?  What do they do with a laser?  I think they actually laser a part of your brain, don't they?  No.  I can't fuck my brain up anymore.  They cannot laser a part of your brain.  Someone like Nicholson at the end of Cuckoo's Nest. 
[02:04:30]  It's in Staten Island.  Some lady I met said she wasn't got laser.  There is no surgery.  She was wearing a toga.  I got the link.  Let me tell you something.  We will look at the link.  Give it to Iraq.  He will punch it up.  I will guarantee you there is no way they touch your brain with a laser to make you stop smoking.  They do something, maybe googly your eyes or something.  It sounds like a scam to me, Rick.  Rich is trying to find a way to quit smoking that's not going to hurt. 
[02:05:00]  Zero pain.  Stop it.  Just do the, Esty took me down for the patch.  I love to fucking smoke.  You smoke more than I do, but I do.  I smoke for 17 years.  I mean, I was going to like to smoke.  Anthony, one day I was going to quit.  I said, I'm going to finish this pack.  And Anthony was just fucking put the cigarettes down.  I said, I'm having one more.  I had one more.  It was a Friday.  I went down to the cellar.  Esty marched me over, got me the patch.  Just marched?  We marched.  Was he leading you with an SS patch on his fucking shoulder?  Let's fucking aid off. 
[02:05:30]  Yes.  We marched.  Yeah.  He cleans out the apartment complex.  The patch had a swastika on it.  Yes.  Lovely red patch, Mike.  Why are you still going for bargains?  Why don't you just go to like a reputable guy and get it done?  He wants to do it without pain.  Rich wants to quit without the fucking emotions.  You're going to cry a lot.  I've been crying for five years since I quit.  I don't understand that the guy is an addict.  You have overcome booze and drugs.  And gambling.  So you know that the only way to really stop, there was no patch for crack. 
[02:06:00]  There's no fucking laser for booze.  I think that was all lies.  You've got to just stop.  Yeah.  I think that's all bullshit.  I almost stole Rich's joke in front of him, or Bonnie's joke in front of Rich.  That it's all bullshit?  No.  Who once said that Rich only did drugs as an excuse for blowing guys?  I just thought of that, and I realized, no, it's definitely not yours.  I said I quit just for the applause break on stage. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  That's funny, but that's good.  That's not what I was quoting.  No, but that's another joke I threw in there.  Oh, of course.  But see, you do what I say that you always do.  What?  You try to steal the laughter from whoever got the last laugh.  Yes.  Yes, he does.  You're saying what Rich does is Rich was piggybacking that moment and trying to be the last one to speak so it looked like his moment.  It's called tagging.  It's called tagging.  You didn't tag it.  You didn't tag it.  That's not a tag.  That's a whole new little story that you brought up.  Yep.  Oh, look, this is comfortable all of a sudden everywhere she goes now. 
[02:07:00]  She's on stage now.  This is a fucking broad.  I was reading a piece of paper in L.A. off a stool.  Now she's on stage with her foot in the front table fucking leaning into the mic and working the crowd.  Okay.  And every now and then one of my fucking lines comes in and goes, hey, you know, you got so many of them.  But she's getting too confident, and that's the problem.  I'm going to have to bring you to the stress factory again.  I'm going to fucking humble you.  I don't give the same love as I used to.  Wow.  Remember when they first hooked up, it was just about love. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  When we first hooked up, it was...  It's kind of a drop-off here just a bit.  Wow.  There's Bengali over here.  He's getting a little scared of his position, I think.  I also hear a lot of avoidance about the smoking question.  Yeah.  Okay, Dr. Phil.  That's right.  Dana Reeves just died.  Absolutely.  She didn't smoke.  She didn't smoke.  She had the secondhand smoke, they're saying, or something.  The secondhand smoke or something?  Was his wheelchair a locomotive?  Fuck, it's the guy here.  Who was smoking, Nira? 
[02:08:00]  He had little kids and an invalid.  From being a...  She was like one of those torch singers.  Oh, so she was in a lot of clubs.  That's what they were saying.  With the smoke.  I had a little info on that.  All right, very good.  I'm glad you did.  I know I sound stupid, but she was a singer in the lounges back in her day.  And they're saying maybe it was the secondhand smoke from way back when.  I don't think that.  I think that whole secondhand smoke is bullshit.  Why don't you just quit?  What are you so scared of?  Because you have fucking kids, you want to see graduate college.  Why don't you stop?  My kids aren't going to college. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, okay.  Then keep smoking.  You have kids that you're going to have to drop off at the butter bing.  That's a regal beagle.  Were you in Sacramento?  Yes.  Last week?  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Richard.  Get an update.  A review.  Yeah, I was just doing sack over the weekend on Sunday.  Great show.  You were there on Sunday?  Yeah.  I couldn't believe you smoked on stage.  That was awesome.  Was that?  Yeah, because you're not allowed to smoke in a club.  You rebel.  You're not allowed to smoke within like 10 feet of a building in Sacramento. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  That was awesome.  Born and killed too.  Yeah, we did.  It was a good show, huh, Richard?  Oh, real good.  Yeah, right on.  Cool.  Yeah, it was great.  He tore a couple audience members up.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  I mean, Richard, Richard, Richard, Vosier gets a bad rep sometimes.  We like to kill him on the show, but it takes a lot of heat on the show, but very funny  when you see him live on the stage.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Now, the bottom line is, Vos, you've been lying about quitting for years.  Listen, we're talking about my fucking stage performance, and all of a sudden you got 
[02:09:30]  the guy brought up smoking on stage is what happened.  He said he was, yeah, so Richard killed, and he was smoking.  You'll be talking, you've been quitting, I'm going to quit on my birthday, I'm going to  quit on my anniversary, I'm going to quit this, and every one of them passes.  I'm sure we got tapes from N.E.W. of him saying he's going to quit soon.  Yeah.  That was years ago now, Rich.  You can't fly and smoke in the airport.  It's awful.  I smoke in the airport, it's in the bathroom.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you stop?  What are you so scared of?  Just stop.  I'm not scared.  Well, I am scared, but, you know, what else do I have? 
[02:10:00]  What do you do on the flights?  You're not going to lose a piece of your job.  I do nicotine gum.  New York to L.A., what do you do?  Well, he complains a lot, number one.  Nicotine gum.  And I sleep a lot.  You're not going to, you're afraid, Richard, you're afraid, A, of being uncomfortable, and  B, like you're going to lose a piece of who you are.  You're not going to lose a part of yourself.  Okay, here's the deal.  I'll make a deal with you.  We'll pick a date, and I quit smoking, and you quit deviant sexual behaviors.  I've already quit smoking, and when-  Whoa, whoa, whoa, I quit gambling. 
[02:10:30]  Hold on.  When deviant sexual behaviors put a tumor on my jaw, I'll quit doing them.  What about a fucking lesion on your face?  Not my problem.  I'll just pass it along.  No, see how easy it is?  What are you so scared of?  I've already quit smoking.  I've already quit gambling.  I quit drugs.  I'm talking about an immediate health risk that's going to fucking kill you, dude.  Some of Jimmy's girls have looked like tumors on his jaw.  I know what you're saying, dude, but I'm not being holier than thou.  I'm not saying quit addictive behavior because it's naughty.  I'm saying smoking is an immediate awful health risk. 
[02:11:00]  I'm not making a moral judgment.  I'm saying it's a fucking horrible risk, and I've quit.  I know how awful it is.  I'm not being self-righteous.  At least you get the AIDS.  You know, you got 10 good years.  Absolutely.  You can fucking always just pretend you got it from a needle or, you know, blood transfusion.  I get sick ones.  And you will look thin at some point.  And you can eat all you want, right, because you're going to lose the weight eventually.  And I haven't...  And my sexual addiction, I'm not running into a bathroom in the airport anymore.  And again, Jim, that's because they clogged up all the holes in the dividers. 
[02:11:30]  It does look, though, Jim, like you purposely try to find women who may have something wrong with them.  I'm not saying, look, I'm not saying that an uncle 15 years ago doesn't help my cause, because it does.  The worse your family, the better it is for me.  But 15 years ago, you knew better.  Maybe more than 15.  Not the girls I'm dating.  Your uncle touched you when you were 21, 22? 
[02:12:00]  No, one.  That's what I'm saying.  15 years ago.  Your uncle didn't touch you.  There's nobody that desperate in your family.  Why don't you quit smoking?  I'm good.  Here's the game plan.  Oh, boy.  All right?  Okay, I'll make a deal with it.  There's a plan now.  That's good.  June 30th on my birthday.  Oh, stop.  One of the first things you said to me when we started dating was that you were going to quit smoking June 30th on your birthday.  Yeah.  And June 30th came without incident.  You didn't even bring it up. 
[02:12:30]  I was already bagging you, so what the fuck?  I already closed the deal.  I had to come up with a new lie.  And his sober date.  He was going to quit on a sober date.  I've heard that one.  I've heard I'm going to quit after the holidays, after the stress.  There's never a good day to do it.  Yeah, you just have to trick yourself.  You just have to one day just go put your cigarettes down.  And realize it's going to hurt a little bit.  If I still obsessed, I'd be smoking again.  You think I could go this long obsessing?  How long did you quit?  December will be five years. 
[02:13:00]  No.  Wait, December of 2001.  It'll be five years in December.  Yeah, I remember when that was.  It was when we were doing the what have you got segment of the show.  I had a moment about it.  What the hell is that?  Oh, yeah, the guy brought the lung in?  It was what the hell is that?  No, the guy was, we had a couple of doctors in the studio, and we had guests come in.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin.  I was actually.  Take his seat.  Take his seat. 
[02:13:30]  Colin Quinn just ripped the boss out of his seat.  Took his headphones.  You were raped.  Oh, man.  That's the most exercise he's done in a month.  Colin, you picked the perfect day to stop by.  You picked the perfect day to stop by.  Get in on this.  I fucking.  The boss is telling us he's going to quit smoking again.  But as Colin walked in, I was thinking about Colin.  That's fucking really creepy.  That's great.  Is that a whole bandage on your nose?  That's from one of the girls he's dating.  Let's get Colin Quinn and Mike. 
[02:14:00]  We need a chair for him, too.  Oh, what is that?  Colin should not just stand.  Look, I'm expecting Bud Fox to save you.  Nothing.  No, that's not bad.  LA Confidential.  Hey.  Come on.  Let's see.  Just threw his breakfast on the floor.  The reason I came by, by the way.  Okay.  Are we going to have an intervention or something?  Something.  The reason I came by.  No, it's an intervention for you two guys.  Oh, what do we do?  A little power corrupts. 
[02:14:30]  Apparently, from giving this idiot a voice on the radio, he drove me home last night.  His Toyota Caddy.  Have you seen that Camry that he calls a Caddy?  Toyota Caddy.  Norton.  Have you seen it?  It's the worst Cadillac ever.  It looks like he showed it to me.  He was like, oh, yeah.  It looks like a Camry.  So he's got the most awful GPS that's like, you know, it's crayons.  To meet your old girl.  And then, uh, and then, uh, so last night we're driving home this moron. 
[02:15:00]  You know, uh, you, I don't believe much in conspiracy.  You always have to deny that he believes in everything and then he believes in it.  So he can feel like he's a unique guy instead of just another, uh, you know, strip mall idiot like the rest of us.  I'm like, I'm not a conspiracy guy like some of these idiots.  Then he goes into this thing about the wing nuts.  We heard about, yeah.  It was just so aggravating.  I felt like saying, you know, either do charity or learn a musical instrument. 
[02:15:30]  Wait, you fucking phony bore.  It's so boring.  What a shithead.  I mean, if you saw these photos, he goes, give me, I'm not giving you my fucking emails.  He's getting whipped.  Send me some shitty picture.  Go back to porn.  At least then you were kind of excited.  You look phony.  Instead of reading a book or taking a class, this is what dumb people do to feel intellectual.  They check out, like, the size of planes.  Go, I mean, if you look at the vector.  Because some other shit.  Because some other asshole sent it to him and go, you know, this is not a 17. 
[02:16:00]  157.  Yes, it probably is.  But who gives a shit?  You boring idiot.  It was actually...  Take that thing off.  Is that a sleep apnea thing?  What else could it be?  Colin, you're on fire.  Don't sit down.  I'm not going to sit down.  He's working the room.  He's pacing back.  You know, I'm just doing some crowd work.  I think it's hot because you don't have to, you know.  Oh, my God.  We all do that, though.  We'll read all those political books and then just reciting what we just read to other people.  Well, but I was honest about where I got it.  I didn't say I made it up. 
[02:16:30]  I said that I found a credible source.  The gravitas in his fucking idiotic face is what got to me.  He put the pressure on me, though, now to dispute this.  But you'll watch it.  He goes, I'll send you the link.  Watch it.  And then you tell me where the piece came from that is in the 757.  Tell him to prove it.  Then you go, well, what's the motive?  I don't know.  Well, that would be part one of this argument.  But I don't know.  Tell me the motive.  Then don't bring it up until you have a motive.  Well, I don't have to have a solution.  No, a motive is different from a solution.  Yes, it is.  A motive is a solution as to why it happened. 
[02:17:00]  Why would the government shove a plane into the Pentagon?  I don't know if they would.  Because they were waiting for the right opportunity.  So that day when two planes went into the World Trade Center, they said, now's our chance.  Quick.  Because the one that went into the Trade Center are legit.  It's that Pentagon one.  They just had it sitting there waiting for that to happen.  He raised some good points, and I had to say he raised some good points.  And you raised no good points.  I didn't say I did.  Beat it.  I really felt good to throw you in.  Go bars in town.  I saw him last night.  Bring him in.  I can call him. 
[02:17:30]  Beat him.  Well, we were talking about Rich Voss and his dumb smoking.  He's got to stop smoking.  Yeah, why don't you just stop, stupid?  I smoke three packs a day and I quit.  When you quit?  Fifteen years.  But he won't tell us why he won't quit.  He keeps making excuses.  He's afraid.  And setting dates when he might quit.  He won't quit?  Because I fucking smoke.  We all smoke.  Jim smoked.  He quit.  Because you're afraid to deal with the sadness and the fear and the anger that's going to  come out when you quit smoking.  You don't have something to hide behind. 
[02:18:00]  So I deal with anger and fear on a daily basis?  Yeah, by you lighting up five packs a day.  I know.  And the fetal position.  And the...  Whoa!  Oh, no.  Some use the misanomation.  Do you know that fire that you were talking about in the hotel room?  Yeah.  Is directly because of your smoking, not because of her candle?  She lit a candle to stop the smoke.  That's right.  No, she was reading tarot cards.  No, that's not true.  If she was reading tarot cards, she's as crazy as you are. 
[02:18:30]  She eats them.  Were you reading tarot cards?  No.  Were you reading tarot cards by candlelight?  No.  I get a, you know, a scented candle.  Oh, my God.  And it's just for the...  Because it's nice.  And it's just for the smoke, right?  Yeah, it's for the smoke.  I'm a way to put myself, because no one will rip it apart.  Do you make them open up the anti-suicide windows like that fraction of an inch?  Last night I was there.  Yeah, you were there puffing out there.  It doesn't work.  Blows it right back into the room.  One night I look over.  He's in bed with a cigarette, asleep. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, that's never resulted in thousands of deaths.  Did you ever see his old apartment on the fucking floor?  It looked like little black snail trails.  Because this fucking lazy Jew kept falling asleep with cigarettes in his hand and dropping them on the floor.  He's not going to die from lung cancer.  He's just going to burn up.  It's going to take a bunch of people with him.  He's fucking, he's sanding something and putting varnish on it.  And he falls asleep and fucking kills everyone in the house.  What's a little richie afraid of when he takes a cigarette away and there's no barriers between him and the world? 
[02:19:30]  That's right.  What is it?  I'd like to know, too.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just, you know, it's, I'm not afraid of anything.  What is a little richie?  You are.  It's addiction.  And, you know.  Right, but what does addiction come from?  Pile of ashes, gold chain and teeth.  Is it addiction when you just accept that?  It comes from, you feel comfortable sitting there with something blocking, a big wave of smoke blocking you, not only from the world, but from your alleged wife.  Absolutely.  Oh, she's reading carriage.  She's reading the car.  I'm not reading too.  By candlelight. 
[02:20:00]  And tea leaves.  Yeah, she's got to eat tea leaves.  It's modern day knitting when a husband's not really.  Yeah, these two are coming up with hobbies so they don't have to hang out with each other.  How quick did this fall apart?  This is the shortest marriage.  I want to fucking know what exactly, like, you are, like, you know, everyone hides.  You hide your fear behind fucking cigarettes.  Other people hide certain failures behind a lot of food the last year and a half.  I knew it was coming.  I know.  Can I theorize something? 
[02:20:30]  A great telegraph acting technique.  Jesus Christ.  Can't wait to see Lucky Louie or what we call it, King of Queens with cursing.  Perhaps, Rich, you, when you started smoking, whatever it was, 20-some years ago, when, how long was it?  I don't know.  Okay, so a long time ago.  I already ate something years ago.  You needed the cigarettes because of your, whatever, your fear, your unhappiness, and now you're addicted, but maybe you don't need the cigarettes anymore. 
[02:21:00]  You have a lovely bride.  Maybe you're better.  You should be happier now.  I'm very happy.  I got a lot.  Look what you scored, bro.  I'll tell you what it is.  Yeah, he did score, big.  The problem is, you still want to think I'm Rich Voss, a teenage rebel, or an old man a few years away from Boca.  Just admit it.  And you're in the cigars.  And walk around.  Your new edition could be complaining about your ills.  Old Jews don't smoke.  What's the matter with you?  I hipped you to use. 
[02:21:30]  It's cigars.  You leave my stuff alone, Noah.  I won't touch your stuff.  But you've got to stop smoking.  I'm going to.  I really know you.  No, set a date.  Just set a date.  Set a date?  Not set a date.  But don't do it for us.  You do it now.  You don't set a date.  How many times do I say I want to quit smoking?  You don't set a date.  You know what you do?  I've never heard you say that.  Where's your pack?  Huh?  Here's how you do it.  Where's your pack?  It's out in the car.  You know what?  Anthony goes to the old school Ron Conkerman style.  Give me the pack. 
[02:22:00]  Ron Conkerman.  In Anthony's family, you just see one of the uncles come out in Bermuda shorts with the sandal.  Give me the pack.  He's smoking.  Give me the pack.  Give me the quick.  There you are.  Done.  But that was how he helped me quit.  He fucking, Anthony helped me quit by that same disgust to just fucking throw the pack out.  You immediately throw it away.  And I did.  I had one more and that was just me.  Yeah, because it's water or one of these people, remember?  No, I don't know.  It was the guy with the thing on his lip jaw.  We were playing. 
[02:22:30]  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  We had doctors in the studio.  Let's do that again.  People would come up and get free examinations for whatever they got.  Something on their legs.  Something on their...  And this one guy had a bump on his gum line.  So the doctor put the glove on and he's feeling it.  He goes, that's a hard lump.  That's not good.  He goes, you have this checked out immediately.  He goes, you smoke?  And the guy's like, yeah.  And the guy's...  And then we start talking about how he's going to look with half a jaw.  Well, the fear on that guy is like, oh God, just tell me what it is.  Tell me what it is.  I mean, it was supposed to be a fun bit and turn it to... 
[02:23:00]  That guy...  It was horrific.  And one doctor, just to add to this, punched out.  He's like, I don't want to be part of this.  Wow.  He saw what was in that guy's mouth and said, I'm done.  I don't want to be part of this.  The guy turned out to not have...  Right.  We found out a month later.  But when he was trying to go, the guy was like saying, all right, where should I go?  What should I do?  And watching him try to hang on to his sanity, I'm like, that is exactly what it looks like  when you find out you have mouth cancer.  Yeah.  Like, that is exactly a moment.  But because the guy was trying to not panic, and that's what's freaking me out.  But it was panicking him. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  Where do I go?  What should I do?  Who should I go to check this out?  And just, you know, I want the best guy.  I'll never forget that day.  You ever stop smoking for a limited time because maybe you had something, you didn't know what  it was, and you're like, uh-oh.  Uh-uh.  Nothing like that.  No.  No?  No, no.  I smoked nonstop.  Just set a date, you phony.  You did quit for six months.  You did quit for six months.  I quit for six months.  Why?  What spurred that?  Uh, I was working in Boston, and I went and saw the mad Russian.  There was a guy up in Boston that-  I went to that guy that didn't work for me. 
[02:24:00]  You want to see-  Huh?  No.  He's just a douche.  He doesn't work for anybody.  No, he doesn't work for a lot.  Oh, shut up.  I went six months.  What's the mad Russian?  He was some-  Some fucking-  You call me a flay for conspiracy theories?  Some fucking commie.  Put this-  Why did you throw my Aussie doll on the milk?  This is turning-  Anything we think somebody might love has to be destroyed.  That's right. 
[02:24:30]  He broke my trophy on his dumb show.  That's right.  Holy shit.  This fucking Aussie doll.  Dude, the little Aussie thing that Sucker Patty gave me, and he just ripped it up in Boston.  Oh, oh, things are going bad.  She's the only person that emails me consistently.  Oh, who's the mad Russian?  So, Colin, when's your show on so I can be on again?  The mad Russian is this fucking flaky douche in Boston, and you sit there, and he does an energy thing over you, and supposedly makes you quit. 
[02:25:00]  And I'm an asshole for thinking that-  It worked for my aunt.  Why did you go?  Yeah, that's really-  21 years.  How about this?  Fuck your aunt.  She was ready to quit.  Yeah, well, if you're ready to quit, maybe that's a help.  I'm really impressed.  Maybe that's a help.  Fuck.  You can do everything you can do.  I mean, you should-  What?  Yeah, get a patch, get hypnotized, do all of it.  Yeah, do you like the smoking, Bonnie?  Everything.  I love it.  I don't want him to quit.  I'm so conscious he wants him to die.  What'd you do?  You can't even accuse him of that, because you know he has no money.  The lost fortune.  It's really not fun to be around somebody who's quitting smoking, and I'm not looking for it. 
[02:25:30]  How fun is he now?  How much fun could he say?  Did you ever smoke, Bonnie?  Ever?  Yes, I did.  You're dead.  It took me many tries to quit.  And you quit?  Yeah, so four years.  How long ago?  Four years.  Mm-hmm.  You miss it?  Actually, at one point, before I started dating Rich, I thought I might actually start again.  It's very rough when you hook up with a smoker, and you've quit for a while, because you just  pick it right back up again.  Well, she drinks and gets high every now and then, so that was hard, too, you know. 
[02:26:00]  I'm trying to even it up.  Maybe you could handle booze now.  No, I can't.  I can't.  Please.  Why don't you go to a smoker?  I know a smoker's thing next week.  Next Sunday, I'll go with you.  To a smoker's thing?  Yeah, like a smoker's meeting.  Next Sunday?  Yeah, Sunday night.  You're not working.  Stop acting like you are.  Wait, what's Sunday?  This Sunday?  Sunday coming up.  Yeah, I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town.  He doesn't even know where Sunday is anymore.  I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town.  What, Sunday?  Sunday what?  What, between Saturday and Monday?  No good.  No good.  And Colin, as much as after that Aussie doll thing, how I really don't want to admit this, 
[02:26:30]  helped me more than anybody.  The thing he said to me, which I don't think he made up, but he said to me, the urge  to smoke will pass whether you smoke or not.  And that was as perfectly simplistic.  Well, it's the same as drinking and getting up.  Shut up.  Stop trying to act like you, too, understand this.  I know.  He's like, yeah.  You're smoking, idiot.  Be the student.  He loves to be the expert on addiction. 
[02:27:00]  He'll just jump in.  Oh, please.  Every...  Listen, this is what you got.  Look at Barney.  Guess what?  Every guy's like that.  Hey.  No matter who you're married, you'd be miserable every time they open their mouth.  Boss, are you going to the Freedom Center?  What the fuck is the Freedom Center?  That's the laser therapy thing.  First of all, when somebody goes, what the fuck?  You know what I'm doing.  Huh?  It's Staten Island.  Welcome to Freedom Laser Therapy.  What does lasers do to make you stop smoking?  Freedom from smoking addiction.  It's Staten Island.  I don't know.  They probably make a good cigarette lighter.  He's done no research.  You're going to light it up with a laser?  He's done no research on it. 
[02:27:30]  None.  Someone said laser.  Someone said it to him.  Dummy thought technology.  It's the future.  No problem.  They'll take out that little cell that makes me smoke.  Oh, stupid.  He thinks they're going to do some kind of brain thing.  I never told you about it.  What's the gimmick here?  They don't really explain.  Oh, good.  It's vague.  It's lasers and it's vague.  Low-level laser therapy.  Hold on.  I think I have it.  You don't have to wear contacts anymore.  They use some kind of Jedi mind shit on you.  You don't need that cigarette anymore. 
[02:28:00]  You have no need to smoke.  You'll feel great.  As soon as it hits Sunday when you get back in town, we'll go to a place.  Here we go.  Here we go.  We've got Tyler and Columbus.  Tyler for Rich Voss.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  You guys were just talking about that guy that had the big lump in his mouth from years  ago.  Yeah.  My father-in-law got the big casino in his jaw and about a month ago, he just had it removed.  He's about, what are you, Voss, about in your 40s?  Good call. 
[02:28:30]  He's 85.  What did he have?  The big what?  He's cancer.  The big casino.  Oh.  I thought he had like Caesars or Bowleys.  No, he's actually had cancer in his mouth.  No headphones.  For Rich.  Oh, for Rich.  For Colin.  Why would there be headphones for somebody that's in studio with us?  Look.  Why?  Why would we have that?  Colin actually took a toilet paper tube to his ear and he put it to Rich's head.  It's a great photo of him.  He's hearing the C.  That's funny shots for you.  Wait.  That's wacky.  That's wacky.  That's wacky. 
[02:29:00]  Wait.  So, he had his whole jaw removed, not the tumor?  Yeah.  They had to take his, the cancer spread through actually the bone in his jaw.  There you go.  There you go, Voss.  All right.  Look both.  And actually the veins and everything in his jaw.  And they had to remove the whole damn thing and rebuild it.  They took like hip from, or bone from his hip and skin from his chest and legs and made  him a new jaw.  But he's all.  Oh.  Hey, Voss, stop.  Did this guy's telling, this guy right now.  I just have a million of these stories.  If I'm not fucking ready, I know.  Yeah.  By the way, caller, you know what?  During your story, Rich was checking his bookings on his Palm Pilot thing. 
[02:29:30]  No, I was trying to.  He's not even.  No, I was trying to find the quit smoking thing right here.  And I found the link, the website or whatever.  No, I mean, people.  Yeah.  Right next to the link to buy cigarettes online.  People can say quit smoking and all that, you know, all that shit.  But it's like, you know, when you see it, like I'm sitting across the room from the  guy and it's like tongues, his dead tongue, his tongue died.  They had to remove that too.  So like 80%.  That wouldn't be so bad.  All right.  There's an upside to the whole thing. 
[02:30:00]  But wait a second.  Was that from smoking?  Yeah, it was from smoking.  Or chewing tobacco?  No, he didn't chew.  They said he got the cancer from, they told him he was going to get cancer in his mouth  from smoking.  Find another way to justify it.  Yeah.  Totalus.  That's all.  One hundreds.  Is he a Christian?  Plus, it's not going to help those tombstones who call peace.  You're going to turn in gray from smoking.  All right, Tyler.  All right.  I'm going to hear what I'm going to do.  I'm sorry you didn't get the reaction you were looking for. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  No, he's got a point which is voice has to have the guts to go to a cancer ward.  We thought you'd get a car crash.  So it's all good.  No, you're fine.  Thanks.  All right.  You know what I'm going to do?  April 22nd.  Why April?  That's my ex-wife's birthday.  Why are you picking a date?  He's supposed to pick a date.  Is that it?  I've done all that stuff.  I just quit.  I once was just like Rich Voss.  Really?  I tried it all.  The mad Russian.  All of them.  Well, here's where Rich is going.  Oh, the laser thing?  Now, what do they do?  It's a therapy you can't even pronounce. 
[02:31:00]  Oriculoral therapy.  Oricul.  It's the one word he can't pronounce.  Is it something like ocular?  I don't know.  A-U-R.  No.  It's natural.  A-U-R.  A-U-R.  What do they go through?  Your ear?  I-C-U-L-O therapy.  Auricular.  Auricular.  All right.  There you go.  Wait a minute.  If this involves your fucking ear.  Here we go.  What is it?  It's a non-invasive form of acupuncture.  No needles.  It utilizes a minor electrical impulse to stimulate acupuncture points in the outer ear.  I did that one, too. 
[02:31:30]  It didn't work.  Really?  Don't be asked.  Why do you think a laser beam in your ear is going to stop you from smoking?  It might stop the cysts that are on the back of my ear.  It's going to start boiling the cyst, and the doctor's going to drop dead.  I'm surprised you can get the lights out.  I thought the, you know, the wetness would put your cigarettes out immediately.  I know.  He spits them out.  This technique's been used for pain, addictions, and a host of many other.  I did it.  It didn't work.  It didn't work. 
[02:32:00]  How have you done it?  It's new.  I did it.  They didn't have it back then.  It's new.  I did it.  It was the acupuncture.  You know what?  You know how stupid Voss is?  It says around the website that they've been doing this since 500 B.C. in China.  I haven't checked the website out yet.  It's new.  Like gunpowder.  What are you, a pterodactyl shit?  Your ass may be, but...  They invented the wheel, and then this technique the next day.  But it's new to Voss. 
[02:32:30]  The newest thing since the stone tool.  Fucking Voss.  I haven't actually gone to the website yet.  It's new.  Look at that in 500 B.C. in China.  I hit you to acupuncture.  One time I went to get like acupuncture, and Norm MacDonald goes, you know, that's great  stuff because I was injured.  He goes, they've used that for millions of years in China.  I go, yeah.  He goes, yeah, then they invented medicine, so they didn't have to use it.  You guys always had a TV quote each other? 
[02:33:00]  What?  I wish I had a...  I don't want to get the car crash.  I want a clip of him lighting up.  What did Kevin Nealon have to say about it?  I'll tell you the truth.  Honestly, I should never come on out being anything again.  Why?  Because of New Year's Eve.  Guys, it's not your fault.  Which is the fact that I pull up on 69th Street and whatever it's called, you know, I'm not 
[02:33:30]  King of Prussia.  Yeah.  And right outside of Philly.  Philly.  And there's a sign.  I'm sure you should get a T-shirt.  Jim Norton, big letters.  Rich Voss, big letters.  Colin Quinn, many letters.  Oh, he took a picture.  Yeah, and then he made a T-shirt.  Can you imagine all jokes aside, even the Opie and Anthony crowd, I came on stage and  I go, folks, that hurt.  And they laughed.  They knew exactly what it was going on.  Can you imagine how bad his career is?  He doubled up on New Year's Eve.  He left there and went and did another gig in Atlantic City. 
[02:34:00]  Okay?  Fucking idiot.  It's New Year's Eve.  Somebody cancel Atlantic City.  Get Colin.  We know he's open.  You're pushing.  It was doing good.  I agree.  I agree.  And he reached for the coffee.  That's always a sign.  I'll distract him with the lifting of the coffee.  Look, I've been on Spanish.  Colin killed on New Year's Eve and gave me the best intro in the world.  Actually, that was an unbelievable show.  I did, right?  You shut that crowd.  First of all, you're one of the best comics in the country.  It's true.  You never knew that until people told you, but thank you.  No, I fucking, I won't. 
[02:34:30]  No, you've never thought I was funny.  We even TiVo'd your HBO special.  That's when it all started with him, when he first hated me.  No, I never hated me.  Boss, let's be honest.  I love you.  No.  Tough crowd.  I looked past my own, the fact that you were too dumb to realize I was funny until  Norton and other people had to point out to you.  His HBO special wasn't one of the best.  I said, after I saw it, I called cable and canceled HBO.  And he got mad, right?  That's not what it was.  For years.  He thought.  What was it?  When are we going to roast at Caroline's?  I wasn't at this roast. 
[02:35:00]  It was him and some other idiots.  And he goes, and he, you know, roasts are all jokes that are funny if you believe them.  One of his jokes was, and of course I have my little snitches telling me.  Years ago.  Before Tough God.  He goes, the luckiest people in the world, Sue Costello and Colin Quinn.  And this is his mentality towards me.  Then he brings me on stage one night.  I was doing like these one-liners, but I pretended it was in a poem form kind of ironically, which  was my first mistake.  He goes, you know, and I bombed.  And this is in the middle of like a tough patch in my career.  He goes, I don't do jokes. 
[02:35:30]  I mean, I don't do jokes.  I knew fucking jokes.  I knew fucking jokes.  Oh, no.  It was just this type of thing.  Fucking Larry can't let go.  First of all, he remembers all these dumb things.  I know.  You were right to say that.  That's what you fucking get for trying to be Andy Kaufman, shit dick.  Go up there and fucking tell jokes.  Andy Kaufman?  They were jokes.  Shut up.  They were jokes.  You weren't there.  You were still in Jersey.  Exactly.  Dick, Dick, Dick.  No, exactly.  Fucking Louis C.K. told you to act like Andy Kaufman.  You'd have the suit on tomorrow.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:36:00]  Okay?  All right.  You'd be fucking...  You know what's so funny?  It's like he was sticking up for you.  Like he was...  It gets all crazy.  I don't know.  It's the beauty of it.  Shark tank.  Yeah, we're going after the jellyfish, you little fuck.  Beauty.  Let me tell you something.  First of all, I've always...  Every radio show I go on, everywhere I go, I always fucking bring up comic books.  After I put you in Tough Crowd, you realize that was funny.  No, before Tough Crowd.  I love you, but you're too dumb to realize how funny I am.  How about this?  Either you fucking stop groveling or you let him grovel. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  One of the two.  Good point.  Here's the thing.  There's three comics I bring up on the radio.  You, him, and Patrice.  Okay?  I always knew Colin was funny.  Okay?  Always.  It's just that he didn't prove himself.  And my good idea.  You know, fucking he's a brilliant guy, you know, and I know he's going to get back.  I can't even believe you're walking around without Nick DiPaolo hanging on your  coattail today.  Oh, that hurts.  Oh, fuck him.  You had to go there.  Why don't we take a break?  Well, they had a little material difference.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Colin, you got any gigs we're promoting or are you just hanging?  See, he just hangs.  No, how about this?  Whatever gigs I'm promoting, chances are he'll show up and do a few minutes up front.  We don't get it.  Oh, that one.  Yes, you do.  Stupid.  That's not getting a laugh.  It's bombed.  But it was kind of true.  It felt true.  When you open for Norton, he gives you a checklist.  It would be fine if I hadn't brought it up first.  He gives you a checklist of bits you can't do.  Really? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  When you open for Norton, he gives you a checklist.  Don't do this.  Don't do this.  Don't do this.  It's a whole subject thing, didn't you know?  Well, that night, him just sitting there with that serious attitude, like, hey, guys,  and he has his little dressing room.  Meanwhile, I messed up all his food.  I smashed his sandwiches.  I put all kinds of, and he didn't even eat any of it.  He's got, like, this special thing where he's got to have every kind of, oh, he's got  this little rider.  He is very finicky.  Yeah, he's a finicky guy.  He's got a rider with little things about what he wants to dress in.  Yeah.  Four bottles of unopened water.  And a big black cock.  That crackle is Colin's pinky hitting the antenna on the microphone. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, that's why I tried to move your hand before, but you don't have to do it.  There you go.  Up.  You're killed.  I don't hold it.  There you go.  Like that.  There you go.  You've got to hold it tight.  You just have to do the thing.  That's the antenna.  There you go.  Just hold it like that.  I know.  Maybe we could get a stand for him.  I'll give him my mic.  It doesn't matter.  All right.  We'll take a break.  I'm going to give him my mic.  Colin Quinn just hanging.  Rich Voss in Cleveland.  Where?  Cleveland Improv this week with Bonnie and Rich Voss.  And Jimmy's going to be in Poughkeepsia.  Poughkeepsia.  Oh, you have bananas?  Yes. 
[02:38:30]  Finally, he's moving back in the direction he belongs.  Where were those big theater gigs?  Loser.  When the HBO show comes.  Hold on.  It's not going to change nothing when the HBO show comes.  Shut up.  I want to answer.  I've been back.  I've been up and down.  Up and down.  I want to answer your question as to when those theater gigs are.  I have the event center at the Bogota Casino with Dave Attell in May going on sale Saturday  and the Orpheum in Boston going on sale, I believe. 
[02:39:00]  With Attell?  Yeah.  And the Orpheum?  Yes.  Both of them with Attell, huh?  Yes.  Why don't you throw Dane Cook on to make sure you don't, you know, empty out the place?  Who's closing?  Dave.  Why?  Why did you get Louis Black?  And if I would have said me, you would have said why.  No.  Who's hosting?  Hey, who's hosting?  We don't know yet, but don't even think about it.  Why?  You fucking perpetual host.  No.  I'm a great host.  Exactly.  You're not hosting.  You're not hosting.  I'm going to fucking weasel myself on your boat. 
[02:39:30]  And I'm going to fucking bury both of you fucking humps.  We're going to take a break.  Hey, when we get back, we've got a lot of comedians in the studio, obviously.  America's Funniest Mom Season 2 started.  Oh.  It's got to be hysterical.  I vote for Yates.  Ben's hog is just big enough for my business.  Well, I do have big tips, goddammit.  Goddammit, what nice tips.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Ladies, be careful. 
[02:40:00]  Hey, they can actually help.  The show continues through the break.  Anthony's been showing Colin Quinn Pal Talk.  The girls at Pal Talk.  We like introducing them to anybody that's come in and hasn't seen Pal Talk yet.  Hey, Colin, seems to like it.  Oh, my God.  Do I like it?  It's Whip them out Wednesday, and the girls are flashing boots and everything else on Pal Talk today.  Yeah, we got one up here, Red Room 6, just sitting there in a little short skirt. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, my God.  Amanda Panda, she's not playing.  Yeah.  And she's in her little skirt, and there's no panties on under there.  Ooh.  So what we are seeing is her and her pierced glory.  She doesn't have any underpants.  No underpants at all.  Ooh.  You see that kid that went to Capitol Hill that was doing all the computer sex?  She made all the money, and now he's snitched everybody out.  I know.  What a little wimp.  Yeah, now he's a rat.  He makes a fortune, and then he just drops a dime.  And he's like, they did this, and my father goes, I'll help you really maximize the business. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  That was the worst.  How old was he?  He started at 15.  Oh, I thought he started at 13.  Was he just jacking off on camera, or was he banging?  Yeah.  He was a phony.  They would tell him to take his shirt off.  Jeez, come on.  Amanda, we're trying to...  Wow.  What's she doing?  It's ridiculous.  Amanda Panda is...  Sucking her own bosom.  Yeah, she's got a nip in her mouth.  That's lovely.  Ooh.  I think that kid, that 15-year-old kid should...  I hope he ends up on the Duke Lacrosse team. 
[02:41:30]  How about that phony story?  How many brothers jump on the young white girls on the b-ball teams?  Nobody says they work.  They hired...  They hired a black stripper, right, for a party.  They're groupies.  How do you know?  Was it white guys raped a black girl?  Is that why they're talking about it?  Well, they hired a black stripper for one of their parties, right?  Well, they hired her to strip and do some housework, and...  Things got out of hand.  Is that what you're saying?  Things got a little out of hand?  It'll happen.  First of all, they're a lacrosse team.  Who gives a fuck about them?  Well, that's a good point.  I didn't even know people still play lacrosse. 
[02:42:00]  Do you guys want the audio of the 13-year-old porn boy from the Today Show?  You bet we do.  Or America's Funniest Moms, season two.  America's Funniest Moms.  Honestly, the Funniest Moms, because in today's...  In this world, you need a laugh.  Yes, especially if you're a mom.  It's so hard to handle the kids and the lifestyle.  Oh, the whole thing is ridiculous.  And be funny.  Well, is Paula Bell on there?  I don't know.  Is she a mom?  She went to the house.  Their house or whatever they do.  They have a house, too?  They had a hotel, or they went to a hotel.  The first clip is Paula, so I guess... 
[02:42:30]  Is it Paula?  Is she funny?  Yeah, I like Paula.  Yeah, she's pretty aggressive and abrasive on stage.  Well, they're trying to find the funniest mom.  They took her kids away from her, if that helps.  That's funny.  Exactly.  America's smartest mom.  Well, let's listen to Paula.  All right.  Let's meet our first semifinalist.  Paula Bell.  Show her some love.  I'm Paula Bell.  I'm from Los Angeles, California.  Being a mom has inspired my comedy.  I have one daughter that's in love with me,  and one who's not too fond of me,  so that's just a lot of humor in that. 
[02:43:00]  In any town I go to,  I'm a regular, average-sized human being.  In Hollywood, I'm a big, huge, fat slaw.  Everybody's so thin,  girls are walking in and out of doors without opening it.  Well, I'm a little...  Get the funny, you know.  I got married too young.  Somebody should have stopped that ceremony.  Walking down the aisle with a backpack on.  All the young girls,  they want to go down the aisle,  parachute down in the big dress.  Taking those little steps. 
[02:43:30]  Here it's home.  You know what they have?  You take those little steps  to get used to the shackles.  It's not marriage, it's Shawshank.  What have we got here?  A fucking comedian.  First of all...  Why is there a music...  I'm sorry, you're up, Trish.  Why is there fucking a music bed on the new bed?  I'll tell you why.  They weren't confident in the material.  Right.  So they overproduced the hell out of it.  What do you mean?  Laugh tracks, music beds, hide awfulness. 
[02:44:00]  Bam.  Down.  Down.  This comedy is the new rock and roll of the 80s.  How funny can you be on these network shows?  She goes on with Brian Holtzman.  I don't know.  Have you seen the Tonight Show when I'm on it?  Pretty fucking funny.  Hey, you're damn right.  That's right, Jimmy.  I know one guy that really stepped up on a network show.  Rich Voss.  Boy, when he was ironing away,  he found a piece of business.  What was it like to sit home and watch me?  What were you eating?  To sit home and watch you on that show?  It was, you know, I felt kind of sad. 
[02:44:30]  I sat there envious, damn it.  If only I could have been on that nightmare.  Why would you have thrown him that fucking underhanded pitch?  What was it like?  Go ahead, sir.  I wonder if they force you on that show to do gynocentric, though, material.  What?  Gynocentric.  Girl stuff.  How you still...  Gynocentric.  Oh, what a great relationship.  And he goes, what?  Girl stuff.  It's like George and Gracie, only he's Gracie. 
[02:45:00]  But it was every joke, Liz.  That's what you guys should do.  The relationship should be that on stage.  Gynocentric, what?  And he got mad at her because he feels like she's embarrassing in front of her.  I'll say words, and he'll say, nobody says those words,  but they're just everyday words.  Oh, yeah.  No, but nobody says them in the circles in which he's traveled, which is 287.  Give us an example.  9W.  Give us an example.  What was one of the words?  Plate. 
[02:45:30]  That she uses.  I don't know.  I don't remember them.  There's no way I would know them.  You know, that one you said the other day.  It's just...  She tries to fucking show off.  I don't try.  What was...  Is this part of her vocabulary?  What word that you didn't know?  Moral courage.  There's two words.  All right.  Here we go.  We got Donna, the fat black comic.  My name is Donna Mary.  I'm from St. Louis, Missouri.  Uh-uh.  This competition would just open up so many different doors that I've been trying to kick 
[02:46:00]  down for so long.  Y'all, I'm going to get ready to reintroduce myself.  And I walked out and clap.  Like y'all invited me over for dinner.  And I told y'all no.  Yeah.  The audience was really great.  And they gave me love.  And I gave them love back.  I'm sorry.  I'm late.  But they ran out of big towels at the hotel.  And I had to drive for the face cloth.  I had that feeling.  Oh, wow. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, but that's funny.  Because everybody has that feeling when you have a small town.  Seven.  Seven out of ten black comics get introduced and they go, that ain't enough.  I'm going to walk off and come back out.  I want you guys.  That's what you did.  I want you guys.  Show some love.  I'm going to start singing.  Oh, the force.  Show some love.  No, stop.  Then they get the applause.  You know, how many people like air and shit like that?  You know, how many people out here bathe?  No applause.  Remember that guy? 
[02:47:00]  We were at this club and this guy, every...  He just kept asking questions to the audience and then they'd applaud.  And I said to Rich, ask when he comes back to the green room, like, how great he did.  Like, he got five applause breaks.  And the guy goes, yeah, they're a nice crowd.  I did well.  Oh, God damn.  How many people applause break?  He was like, is there Catholics in the audience?  Do we have...  So he goes back and I go, man, you killed how many applause breaks you get.  He goes, like six, right? 
[02:47:30]  I did well.  Yeah, they liked me.  Every emcee you work with on the road is horrific.  Right?  Kahlo was the only good emcee.  Oh, no.  Do you see how big this stupid Duke story is?  Is this about fucking...  You understand how divided by class and race...  This country is so phony.  How about the fucking Daryl, the Little John?  Why don't they talk about that?  The way he fucking raped that white girl.  They don't talk about that.  Or she was actually a Filipino.  Whatever the fuck she was, she was asking for it.  Well, you know...  Whoa!  No, he only said that because he was ashamed when he realized she wasn't white.  Meaning there was no...  No, meaning there was no racial implications. 
[02:48:00]  I know, but the point is, it's white media going, oh, let's try to absolve ourselves in  case there's a riot.  They won't hit us.  Right.  It's fucking level.  Why don't you admit that all these incidents that happen with athletes 90% of the time,  it's a black athlete's doing it to white people.  They just did on Dateline, they did a thing with, in cabs, where they had, no, where they  had the driver, where they had the driver baiting the passengers to talk about racial  stuff.  And they had, you know, a white driver have them talk about Jews, have them talk about  Chinese and everything. 
[02:48:30]  But they can't have any black driver with black passengers talking about white people.  Well, because they don't pick up black people.  No.  No, but you see what I'm saying?  It made everybody look bad.  They tried to do that part of the story, but...  But let me ask you something, when somebody brings up a subject, like I just put up, like  a nationally sweeping subject, don't you go from a specific thing like the cab thing  into a national thing, not the other way around?  Do you know what I mean?  He was giving a...  He was giving one example.  I understand what he was doing. 
[02:49:00]  He was giving an example so that you knew he understood.  I know, but it was really...  It just took all the wind out of everything.  Well, maybe if you stood there with a pool stick in your hand, it would have been a lot  better.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Are you a tough crowd?  Yeah.  Oh.  I didn't even know that there was a racial...  I didn't know that there was a black girl that they...  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Jesse Jackson.  That's why it's a big deal.  Oh, fucking enough women.  That's why it's a big deal.  It makes me wonder who I hate more, white people or black people.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Wow, you are profound.  I like Filipinos.  I don't know any...  She wasn't Filipino, by the way.  I like to fill them up with Pino.  Oh, you still pissed because you were wrong?  Shut up.  She wasn't Filipino.  She was closer to Filipino than white, so at least you were admitting that you don't  beat it.  At least you're admitting you don't know what she was.  Yeah, I'm saying she was Filipino.  I like to fill them up with Pinos.  Oh, stop.  All right.  You're guessing.  Here's another clip.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  She wasn't Filipino.  Do you see your eyes?  By the way, are these single, funniest single bombs, or are these just moms?  No, just moms.  Just moms. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  There's a lot of married.  They're still talking about Duke.  It's the big story on CNN.  It's one of the big stories out there right now.  Play the Sally Field clip.  Which one?  Oh, my God.  How old is that movie?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  That new movie Punchline reference?  They had lockers.  Comics were in lockers.  It's right.  It's right there with the acupuncture.  It's new.  Acupuncture.  Well, then we got this story, too, that we were supposed to get to.  Cynthia McKinney, yeah.  She, all right, we got to.  How about one more Lupino, too? 
[02:50:30]  Shithead.  Let's go to America's Funniest Mom, season two.  Here's good old.  You knew what I was trying to say.  Here's good old Jess.  I'm Jess Day.  I'm from Denver, Colorado.  I just want to show that females are just as funny as the guys.  Shut up.  Ladies out here dressing real nice, real pretty.  I can't do that anymore because I have a 204-month-old.  I couldn't be funny without my son.  He's my whole act, and I wouldn't have anything else to say. 
[02:51:00]  I blame my mother the reason why we got beat up all the time.  I do.  I grew up in the inner city.  She's going to raise me like we lived in the suburbs.  You know, we're going to have book club meetings and stuff.  They find out we can read.  You know what they're going to do to me?  I won.  Can I get my check?  Ladies, go home.  Your kids are calling.  That's why I am America's Funniest Mom.  Not only can you not be funny without your kids, you couldn't also get government assistance  without them.  You can't stutter on any of the words on radio.  I hate when shit comics are like, oh, I just want to prove that women are funny. 
[02:51:30]  It's been proven.  There's been lots of really good female comics before your dumbass came along.  Exactly.  Such a, like...  Slow down.  Mom's neighborly.  Why?  That new one, Mom's neighborly.  Mini Pearl.  That price tag cracks me up.  Wait, Bonnie's starting to send something.  Go ahead, Bonnie.  Say it.  No, it's fine.  It's a strong audience.  It's a strong audience.  Go ahead.  Come on, Bonnie.  She's disrespectful to every other female comic. 
[02:52:00]  I'm going to prove it.  I'm going to prove it.  That is true.  There are plenty of guy comics that stink.  That's right.  But since there aren't as many girl comics as guy comics, the ratio there, there's more  girl comics.  That's exactly right.  Now, who's good is...  And the other mistake...  Go ahead.  Well, I was going to say Marina.  That we say at the cellar all the time.  She's working with me in Poughkeepsie this weekend.  If her fucking manager would stop asking for eight grand.  That's funny.  You go, who's funny, Marina? 
[02:52:30]  That's like going, I had a colored friend in high school.  I mean, she is funny, but there's...  You don't give a shit if she's black.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you why I think she's funny.  No, no, no.  Because she's black.  She doesn't do the typical, you know, female comic bullshit.  She's just a funny...  Yeah, no, I wasn't saying because she's black.  But when are you going to quit smoking?  Listen, like, you could get tons of funny...  I mean, Judy Gold, I think, is funny.  Yeah, but what about Marina?  Marina's great.  I had her open for me at the fire for Keith McCombs.  All I'm saying is, like, I'm with Anthony... 
[02:53:00]  No, the stereotypical female comic, it's so played out.  It's like, we get it.  No, you're right.  The kids, the fucking dating, the mom is still...  Oh, if I don't get a husband soon, my mom...  Right.  Why do I feel like the girl on the right-hand side is being forced,  and there's two bikers right off camera?  I'm a pal dog.  That's the best kind of porn when they...  You don't want to be doing it.  Gun point.  All right, why don't we see what Joy's all about?  America's funny as mom.  I love kids.  I love playing with kids. 
[02:53:30]  I'm Emily J.  I'm from Royce City, Utah.  My sister has a little baby, and she brought him over to my house last week,  so I went and got a ball, and I rolled it to him,  and he screamed, and he wouldn't roll it back.  I guess bowling just isn't his sport.  I love the one-liners.  That's my favorite.  So last week, my son brought home a ferret, and he said,  Hey, Ma, do we have anything warm we can put over it?  And I said, Sure.  How about the Buick?  I love the little hand gesture you do.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great little touch-toe.  The jokes suck. 
[02:54:00]  I've met a bunch of the other moms,  and at first I was kind of intimidated by them.  I thought, Oh, they're all so funny.  They're all so funny, and they're funnier than me.  It sounds like therapy, doesn't it?  The Buick line was good.  She actually, I like that.  She's hurting a child with a bowling ball  and killing a little ferret, or the car.  Yeah, they're both abusive, fucking angry jokes.  That's it.  She wins.  No, but she sounded like Rita Rudner too much.  Yeah, she didn't have that retail delivery.  Oh, Rich. 
[02:54:30]  Here's Lisa, the hot one.  I'm Lisa Alvarado from Los Angeles, California.  When we used to sit my whole family around the TV  and watch Bill Cosby,  the whole room was just electric with laughter.  And I'm like, I want to know how to do that.  Was he molesting you?  My last name is Alvarado,  which is Spanish for single parents.  My experiences today,  it was hard because of the way I look.  I knew that they expected me not to be funny.  Lisa, can you go get us some chicken?  I can get you a little can of whoop-ass. 
[02:55:00]  I think I proved them wrong tonight.  I'm not even the typical Latina, you know?  I don't fit in just because I was pregnant in my late teens, you know?  My mom was total pressure.  She's, hurry up, your little brother's already a grandfather.  That's funny.  Call them and see it.  That's funny, as we pay for all of that.  Yeah, another $200 a month out of you.  That was my respect to you. 
[02:55:30]  That was a joke I just did a second ago.  What was a joke?  What joke?  Government assistant.  Oh, yeah, you can't just blurt out government assistant.  And first of all, her kid doesn't even live with her.  Half of these moms, her kids don't live with them.  They're living in another state with their...  What are you doing, an expose on the house?  You're working for Dateline?  How do you even know that?  We found that these parents aren't even really parents.  Half of their acts.  Well, I heard you're not really ducking your daughter over that... 
[02:56:00]  I heard you're not ducking your daughter over that loan, Shadad.  Oh, my God.  You're living in an orphanage.  You know, those new buildings they put.  This is a charity level, aren't we?  Who does she think he is, Nutsy Fagin?  She's just a big sister.  This guy's going nuts on the phone here.  Brian, what's the problem?  Oh, you've got to kill this.  This is awful.  I can't even listen to this.  This is like the comic equivalent of the women's basketball with the spastic layups. 
[02:56:30]  Wasn't everyone excited to watch the NCAA Women's Championship?  Oh, dude.  I mean, one of them will actually get to the Liberty.  That's great.  I tried watching it, but then I was like...  I don't like good stuff.  I'll tell you.  They're bringing it a little better.  They are.  They almost...  They can play.  That's fucking women boxing.  Women boxing.  You can box.  Yeah, let them fight fucking Mitch Blood Green.  They can't box.  Women can't box.  Have you seen some of these freaking boxing men? 
[02:57:00]  No, they can't box.  They can't box a man.  Yeah, some of them could.  No, they can't.  A guy?  Put him in a ring with Chuck Lydell in the octagon.  Exactly.  That's what I want to see.  I want to see that animal rip her tits off and shove him down her throat.  Chuck Lydell.  Chuck Lydell.  Maniac.  He's the most undefined badass ever.  Oh, what an animal.  He's got no definition.  No definition whatsoever, but he will kill you.  Yeah, he'll kill you.  Want to listen to more of this crap?  No.  Go ahead.  I don't know.  I kind of like her.  She has some good ones. 
[02:57:30]  I'm Sherry Davey.  I'm the mother of a beautiful daughter.  I've lived in this country for so many years.  People are still mimicking me like mad.  It's incredible.  I walked into the theater tonight.  This woman overheard me speak.  She's like, oh, my God, you're English.  Cup of tea.  Like, you're laughing.  I don't talk like that.  And how come it's okay to make fun of me, but it's not okay to go up to somebody else and  be like, oh, my God, you're Indian.  Oh, goodness gracious me.  Welcome to my convenience store.  How come that's not okay? 
[02:58:00]  I am not a British woman.  I am an American with an English accent.  I wasn't raised here, but I was born in New Jersey.  I'm an American.  And Americans do come with funny accents.  If you don't think that, then you haven't been to Tennessee.  You write it on your hand?  Yes.  This is what I always do.  This is my thing.  This is my ritual.  You know it.  I do know it.  You know it.  But you know it.  I've just touched your business.  Believe it or not, I do live in Brooklyn.  It's a very hard place.  Very tough.  It's the first place I ever heard the expression, move your freaking wheelchair.  I'm not kidding you.  Somebody said that, I swear to God.  And it was a blind guy.  I'm not kidding you. 
[02:58:30]  English Joan Rivers.  So I'm not kidding you.  I'm not kidding you.  It's not a real kind of kidding you.  I'm not kidding.  America's Funniest Mom should be sponsored by a coat hanger company.  Oh, my God.  It's an atrocious fucking show.  You got to hear Donna Lee.  What network is this on?  What is it?  W Black.  Nickelodeon.  Nickelodeon.  Is it really?  Wow.  It's not bad. 
[02:59:00]  Anybody watching the Midget Show, by the way?  What's that?  Were they whites and blacks trade places?  No.  Which one is it?  The Midgets.  Yeah, yeah.  Little People, Big World.  Family of Midgets.  Oh, best show on TV.  And then one of the kids ain't a midget.  What's it on?  Two midgets or dwarfs, whatever they are, got together and they had four kids.  Three are normal size and one is the luck of the draw.  And the one that's not normal size has a twin brother that's normal size.  I want to do a show on Patty's building. 
[02:59:30]  Starring Patty.  Like a Mary Tyler Moore with all those degenerates and psycho ex-convict murderers that live in that building.  You know the degenerates that must live in that building.  Who can turn the world on?  At the end, she throws up her wig and Opie hides it.  Who can make a nothing day and suddenly make it even more nothing.  Well, if no one has seen the show, then forget about it. 
[03:00:00]  You should check it out on TLC.  I want to see it.  TLC has become the freak network.  And what happens if people bully them and make fun of them?  No, they live on a farm and I don't know.  It's under the guise of, you know, understanding.  Do the animals attack them?  They have to enter through the dog door.  A lot of footstools.  You can always tell when the one midget kid answers.  It's just like, ring.  What?  And you know the executive's like, I'll tell you one thing. 
[03:00:30]  I don't know much, but I know people are going to keep the TV on when you see a cow chasing a midget.  Let's go to Jason in North Carolina.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, is everyone here?  Yeah, we can hear you.  Are you panicking on us?  Go, man.  Guys, I'm sorry.  I'm moving into the house right now.  I'm kind of, I'm kind of.  Hey, I just want to tell Colin real quick.  Hey, man, I was out of Hurtville last year when you came out and did your show.  I really appreciate it.  And the Marines really enjoyed it.  Thanks a lot, man. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, thanks, bro.  Hey, do you live near Duke?  No.  What do you think of that whole nonsense?  Yeah, I'm on the coast.  I'm over, I'm about two hours away from Raleigh, Durham.  Oh, I like it.  Wilmington.  Yeah, right up there in Camp Lejeune.  Nice.  Well, thanks, man.  It was my pleasure.  Love the show.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Thank you guys.  All right.  Very good.  We'll go on to the next mom, Donna Lee.  I'm Donna Lee McBride.  I'm the mother of one.  My mom is Thai and my dad is Irish, so I am Tyrish.  I thought, though, it could be worse. 
[03:01:30]  If my mom was from Canada and my dad was from Chile, I'd be a can of Chile.  Does this come in a 3X?  Because this is fabulous.  I'm sure.  My mom lives on a tiny little ranch in Texas.  I called her as soon as I found out I was coming to New York, and I was so excited.  And she said, Donna, I have the goose nipple.  And I said, do you have goose pimples?  And she said, that's what I say.  I have the goose nipple.  I think people understand cross-cultural humor because if they don't have a family member, 
[03:02:00]  they have an experience or a friendship or something that they probably draw from.  Or rape, hatred, or something.  These girls haven't had enough pain in their life to be funny.  You can tell.  They were thrown into this house.  Paula has.  Paula goes out with that guy, Brian Holtzman, okay, who's hilarious.  But you can tell.  You're in deep trouble.  You better say something funny.  That was the worst train of thought I've ever heard.  I know.  How about this?  How about this?  We all just were hoping.  Two days I actually went on whatever that's called. 
[03:02:30]  Atkins?  No.  I had nothing on that one.  Oh, that was a good one.  The two days I went on my MySpace.  So this girl writes this letter.  I was like, ask, tell me what you think.  So I thought it was going to be a flash in her tits, of course.  I go on to some amateur comic.  Like, do people do, if you do, if you have family there, will you dare do a joke that's  going to be offensive to your family?  So it's like 12 responses from open micers.  All you say, blah, blah, blah.  Then the last response, if it's honest, you got to do it. 
[03:03:00]  Voss.  No way.  I said that.  I said, no.  No way.  Why are you bothering to answer these questions?  You're filling out questionnaires.  A lot of people will write in as Rich.  So it's not really Rich answering all these things.  That is obviously Rich.  He's trying to protect them.  And Voss is going, no, it was me.  First of all.  If it's honest, you got to say it.  Not like those mothers that don't live with their kids.  Why don't you put that in? 
[03:03:30]  Okay.  Did you type that with a battery on your shoulder, Robert Conrad?  First of all, people ask for advice, and I try to help out some of them.  Why are you not helping them?  Yeah, I'm helping them.  I said, if you're honest on stage, who gives a fuck with the audience?  You don't have to be honest on stage.  You have to be funny.  Thank you.  There you go.  Hey.  Whatever.  Let me interrupt this program to bring you.  The Ozone Midget Sighting.  More midget sighting.  Who saw this coming?  Brian in Washington, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Over the weekend, Saturday, I had a midget sighting in front of a 
[03:04:00]  liquor store.  All right.  He just asked me that if he could make me laugh, would I buy him a beer?  This fucking man just takes him while standing, bends down, and puts his fucking  head on the fucking ground.  So his feet were flat on the ground, and so is the top of his head?  He bends over.  That is correct.  Did you buy him the beer?  Or fuck him?  I got him a beer, got him a bag of chips. 
[03:04:30]  I asked him if I buy him the chips, will he do it again?  I want to get a picture of him doing it.  So I get my cousin.  He stole the camera.  With his cell phone.  He fucking does the thing, but my cousin yells a bad midget and kicks the midget in his  ass while he's doing it.  That's exactly what your cousin should have done.  That's exactly what he should have done.  Did your cousin's ankle bracelet get caught in his pants? 
[03:05:00]  Sir, the picture didn't come out.  It just showed you the gun and the elevator buttons.  Now, the fucking midget hopped up so fucking fast, and he's chasing my cousin around, just  yelling at him.  What a great midget story.  That is the saddest story I've ever heard.  Involve the midget getting hurt, degraded, exactly over a crime, and alcohol, and he's  hungry.  Just so he can forget about his miserable life.  Short.  Was this on the wire?  What happened?  Where did this take place?  It had to be Baltimore. 
[03:05:30]  This is in Washington, D.C.  Oh, D.C.  D.C.  D.C., representing.  All right.  Thanks, Brian.  All right.  That was a funny story.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  So, boss, you were saying?  No, I was saying you've got to be honest.  Stop it.  But, see, you're saying it like it's a conversation.  The way you put it, he was trying to be profound with some, like, one-line.  And he even leaves his name Voss, V-O-S.  He didn't say Rich Voss.  What was it? 
[03:06:00]  Okay, but that's because he can't type very well.  It was just like, yeah, it was him just giving the final, you know, like-  What was it again?  It was him saying, if it's honest, you've got to say it no matter what.  If it's honest, you've got to say it.  So, in other words, if you're performing, you know, in front of a bunch of, like, you know,  Holocaust victims, if you have a funny joke about gassing the showers, you have to say it no matter what.  Rich would, though.  That's the truth.  First of all, the two days you were on MySpace, you are there more than two days. 
[03:06:30]  And when you, first of all, you, I'm not, my guy runs it.  I've been on there two days.  Who's your guy?  I don't know, some kid that runs my MySpace.  Uh-oh.  Is he 14?  Is he in front of Congress recently?  He's a police officer.  There's never 14-year-old boys.  Another one.  Head of one of the guys from Homeland Security.  Yeah.  Got arrested.  Another guy who thinks he's talking to a 14-year-old girl online. 
[03:07:00]  Yep.  Sets up a little meeting.  Oops, it's a cop.  You never hear one story of a guy actually hooking up with a 14-year-old.  Well, why don't you have a fucking cop posing as a pedophile,  and when the kid shows up, the cop slaps him for being a fucking tattletale.  Hey, you're fatter than your picture.  Here's the news story.  Authorities say 55-year-old Brian Doyle sent pornographic movie clips over the Internet  to whom he thought was a 14-year-old girl.  They also say he went so far as to reveal his name 
[03:07:30]  and that he worked for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Smart.  Just before police arrested Brian Doyle at his Maryland home,  they say the Homeland Security deputy press secretary  was chatting online with someone he thought was a 14-year-old girl.  This was as perverse and as sickening as a case as we've seen.  Authorities say Doyle was actually conversing with the Polk County, Florida, 
[03:08:00]  sheriff's deputy posing as a teenager.  He graphically explained to a 14-year-old girl what he would like to do to her  and what he would like her to do to him.  But he didn't.  Plus, she was 14.  Let's not act like it was a little girl.  Well, 14, you know, 14's the new 18.  Well, the guy acts like, oh, it's always horrifying.  No, if he's a little kid, it's horrifying.  Well, so is 14.  What the fuck is that?  When I was 15, I went out with a 14-year-old girl.  Yeah, but you weren't 55. 
[03:08:30]  He's a 55-year-old.  He is now.  And to show you the heart, she was the best piece of ass I've ever had.  And I have all of it all the world.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had,  and I've had him all over the world.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Run back to all of the videos.  How fast did they get that one up?  That's insane.  How could they do that?  Anthony just pushes buttons.  He knows where everything is.  Yeah, we are just...  He sure does push buttons.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  I just happened to have the godfathers up there.  Alice Rocco just died, didn't he? 
[03:09:00]  Did he die?  Won't see him no more.  Yeah, I think he died.  Are you kidding?  I'm trying to have him be banging his ball.  He's getting fucking fresh.  Will you relax?  I didn't mean to offend you.  You guys...  I apologize.  He's really making me laugh.  The video, by the way, getting back to that story,  was great with the box coming out of the home.  Oh, yeah.  You never want to be the guy.  He's cuffed.  The cop is bringing him out.  And in front of him is another cop holding a big box full of filth. 
[03:09:30]  You know it's just a box of filth.  And that guy knows what's in that box.  He doesn't wait until they get to tape three.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because they're not viewing him at the house.  They're just going, I'll grab this tape, this tape.  And he's like, that one's nothing.  That one's a copy of this.  That's my vacation.  That's a copy of the incredible site.  Oh, that one's the battle, and they grabbed it.  But he knows what kind of porn he's got.  He's got the 14-year-olds.  He's like, oh, God, I did download the two-year-old.  Oh, God.  Why?  I just wanted to watch it.  How do we know these girls on PayPal are at 12? 
[03:10:00]  First of all, it's not PayPal, you fucking illiterate.  It's pal talk.  It's pal talk.  You know what I mean?  And all I have to say to that is dare to dream, my friend.  How do you know they're 18?  What, are they holding up their license?  Yeah, what you do is you say Spongebob, and if they jump up and clap, you fucking close  the window.  Now, they have to click off on something.  I'll tell you, that girl is being held captive.  Look, in the right-hand corner.  Yeah, yeah, there is something very evil and sexy about that.  Miss, what do you want us to do?  What's your address? 
[03:10:30]  It's something to the cops.  There's something very sexy about that, right?  Which one are you talking about?  In the right-hand corner.  Red rum owes ticks.  Red rum.  She's the one that's wearing the shorts.  She's been sitting there shaking and crying for an hour, and I see shadows of, like, two  guys behind her.  I still want some guns.  Oh, look at those bosoms.  Hey, we got more on the Homeland Security guy.  The 55-year-old is charged with using a computer to seduce a child and transmission of harmful  material to a minor. 
[03:11:00]  What shocked us was he didn't hesitate upon the first conversation to identify himself  as a deputy press secretary for Homeland Security.  The Polk County Sheriff said Doyle had multiple internet and telephone conversations with  the undercover detective.  He provided his office, and government-issued cell phone numbers and this identifying photograph.  He emailed photographs of himself with his DHS security tag clearly visible.  Doyle's arrest came just hours after a real victim of internet child pornography testified 
[03:11:30]  on Capitol Hill about the need for the government to act quickly to protect children from online  sexual predators.  Doyle is expected to be placed on administrative leave.  A federal investigation is also underway, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security  has promised its full cooperation.  He is currently in an area of jail waiting to be extradited to Florida.  Wait a minute, the guy is a deputy press secretary. 
[03:12:00]  I probably lost my thought.  No, it was something else.  I completely lost my thought.  Wow.  Completely.  You know, listen, I'm so glad these people are getting locked up or whatever, but isn't  that entrapment?  Yeah, I don't know how they get away with it.  He said, he goes, he was carrying on a conversation that was disgusting with a 14, you know, asking  a 14-year-old girl things he'd like to do, and the fact is, he wasn't.  He wasn't.  He was asking a cop that was of age, you know, he's asking a guy or a girl cop. 
[03:12:30]  It's a tough cause for us to get behind.  Yeah, I'm not really going to rally support for this one, folks.  But it's censorship.  It might be because if you want to talk.  What if this fantasy is just making believe he's talking to a 14-year-old?  Is that a crime?  That he gets caught in the net like the occasional fucking dolphin does.  We all love our tuna.  And this guy is Homeland Security.  He can't figure out that he's not talking to a 14-year-old.  How is he protecting the country?  Yeah, he doesn't care.  Maybe he, it's very possible that the legality is if they contact you. 
[03:13:00]  The pedophile usually, like perverted justice, always contacts the kid.  Yeah, but it's not a kid.  No, no, no.  It's like buying drugs, but it's really powder because there's a cop selling it to you.  If your intent is, it's like buying guns.  So you want to buy fucking guns, and they have plastic guns they bring, and you purchase them  thinking they're real guns, you're still going to be charged with that.  I want to fuck a gun.  What?  Yeah.  Well, you've never been on the receiving end of a rifle and a good story.  Maybe a good scolding.  Could you guys get gun pistol permits for yourselves, carry permits? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Can you get me one?  I want to buy a new Springfield.  There's this new gun.  You know, this comedian, you guys know Adam Leslie.  Yeah.  Rich doesn't.  He was a crackhead.  He stole my gun in LA, but I want to get a new gun.  A pistol or a rifle?  A pistol.  Yeah, a pistol.  A new Springfield 10 millimeter?  Yeah.  Hard.  Very hard.  I'll just write myself a death threat, and I'll say, someone send it to me.  You can do that.  Outside New York City, it's a lot easier.  It still takes you six months.  I went to get a gun permit, right?  And when I was 18, I was busted for pot, just like a couple ounces, right? 
[03:14:00]  You didn't write it down.  Yeah, because I thought it was expunged from my...  No, they say even if anything's expunged, you have to write down every ticket.  I had to write down this.  Get this.  I had a suspended license when I was 22 years old.  Yeah.  And I was driving my Model T down the road, and I rear-ended somebody.  Cops came, found out my license was suspended, took me down to the precinct to give me a desk  appearance.  He was going to fucking Penrods. 
[03:14:30]  Not even arrested.  Just to give me a desk, you know, appearance ticket type thing.  Check me out.  I had to write that down.  Okay.  You have to write down whatever happened to you legally.  Every ticket you got, the disposition of every ticket, write it down, or else they go,  oh, didn't write it down.  Fuck you.  You get no gun.  Okay, so this was 15 years ago that I was rejected.  They said, you didn't write that down.  Can I still go back in?  Yeah, you can reapply and say, I don't like when I bring up an idea, which shouldn't 
[03:15:00]  even be brought up on the radio, it was selfish and stupid to me, then he's jumping on my  bandwagon trying to get you to give him advice on buying a gun.  Well, because he knows you're out of it and quit smoking.  Buy one off the street.  I was going to get a laser thing.  Why don't you get an alcohol, tobacco, and firearms?  A laser thing.  I was just going to get a laser thing.  Your fingers couldn't reach the trigger.  What good's a gun?  I was going to get it to help him quit smoking.  You're going to get a lightsaber?  What are you getting?  A laser thing.  No, he said he was getting a taser.  Oh, a taser?  I wanted a taser for comedy.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:15:30]  He wants to taser his own audience.  No, did you or did you not say that?  Yeah, in case they come at you.  You never know.  You know it's the league.  Why don't you do some of those wheel kicks we've seen you do?  The fucking greatest moment of my life.  I was seeing a British girl years ago when we were out in front of this Chinese place and  fucking Voss is there talking about how he took karate.  And dumb show off goes to do like a fucking straight out kick and he slips and he falls  in garbage juice.  He fucking, it was by a big pile of garbage bags and he fucking, he slipped and fell right 
[03:16:00]  on his stupid back in his garbage juice.  It's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Take it, ladies.  How did you come back from that?  What did you say when you got up?  Anything?  We just laughed.  I like the way, I like the way, I like the way, I was seeing a British girl like it was 
[03:16:30]  Notting Hill.  Instead of some triple labia fucking prostitutes.  She just had a miscarriage.  I was seeing this British girl.  Well, if you've ever seen Hugh Grant.  James North, we're out for a night at the theater, are we?  It was more just for a reference of time.  Take her dining right near garbage juice.  Yeah, you shouldn't even be near garbage juice with a British girl.  He was just pointing out his career. 
[03:17:00]  Why stop the moment?  Oh, my God.  Is Lady Diana Marriott still calling?  Oh, every so often.  They can't afford the satellite, so.  Yeah.  We don't hear from them often.  I miss that Dennis Young haircut.  Come sail away.  All right, we can go back to the funniest mom thing. 
[03:17:30]  We're almost done.  Please.  This is Pam, fat redneck.  I'm Kim Harrison.  I am the mother of Warren.  I live in Columbia, South Carolina, and I live in a trailer.  I know you're stunned.  It's a double wide.  It'd have to be.  My dream.  Right ass.  My dream is to be on Broadway.  They need a bigger size for bigger girls like me.  Something like one size fits all y'all.  We have a seven-year-old daughter.  She's the most beautiful child on the face of the earth.  Big blue eyes, just like her daddy's best friend.  Oh, she fucked her, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  Because it sounds like daddy, but she trails it to best friends.  She should have said brother, because then the redneck.  Well, she should have shown a picture of daddy's best friend, and it was his dog.  Let's punch up the funniest mom.  Big black Rottweiler cock straight in her right out.  Sassy mom in her double wide with a fucking fat dog dick buried in her.  Big fucking pink lipstick right in that fucking fat white box.  I ran out of things to say. 
[03:18:30]  I'm getting an erection.  Oh, my God.  That was really miserable.  We've got to bring up that the streak of the hot teacher banging the student is over.  Oh, over, Johnny.  It's over, yeah.  You've been following the hot teacher banging the student.  There's that one.  No, there was a whole slew of them.  Yeah, but the one was the hottest ever.  She winds up getting off with no prison time at all.  Well, she shouldn't.  They let her go, man.  She was so hot, and they let her go. 
[03:19:00]  Because legally, people wanted to be, oh, you know, looks matter and everything.  So at least the law was being honest.  The law was completely being honest.  And the newest one was out.  Where is it on?  Is it on Smoking Gun?  Let me check Smoking Gun.  Go to Smoking Gun.  Smoking Gun.com, but I believe it was on Drudge.  And we got the latest one.  The wonderful Drudge.  We got to show the picture.  Yeah.  She was good.  She should be on Girls Gone Wild Island. 
[03:19:30]  Is that her?  Teacher charged for giving student a wedgie.  Get out of here.  That's new.  That's great.  Oh, that just happened yesterday, right?  Did it?  Well, I saw a thing that said, a bizarre form of punishment.  Teacher gets in trouble for a bizarre form.  Oh, they didn't tell you it was the tease.  No, it was some, yeah, it was some male teacher did it to you, like a girl on a G-string, I hope.  You need a wedgie, miss.  Or it's even hotter if he fucking yanked each end of her diaper.  That uber wedgie. 
[03:20:00]  Not that she was young.  She was just retarded.  Incontinent.  15-year-old retarded girl.  Fat with a big head.  Look at this, Katie Couric.  That who was.  She was leaving.  She was leaving.  Memories of Katie.  She's going for the morning.  We're on the pick.  Oh, who's this?  No, no.  Look at the teacher.  Mark Hawley, 41, charged with giving a 10-year-old a wedgie.  He's a killer.  What a nightmare.  That guy is a prick.  Oh, no.  The 41-year-old is charged with endangering the welfare of a child. 
[03:20:30]  Must have been some wedgie.  The mother of the boy told investigators she reported,  the alleged incident to school administrators immediately after it happened.  Kill him.  What did she say when she called Colonel Kurtz gave me a wedgie?  That guy is evil.  That is a scary-looking guy.  Kill him.  It would have been different if he was still looking.  You've got to find the teacher,  because they're claiming that she gave 27 blowjobs in a week.  What?  No, it was actually, she had sex with a 13-year-old 27 times in one week and one blowjob. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, one, okay.  27, there she is.  I don't care what, yikes.  The streak is over.  The streak is over, gentlemen.  The streak is over.  The hot streak has ended.  Is that Big Jay Oakerson?  That's the one that, what, the 13-year-old?  27 times in a week she got into a course and gave him one blowjob.  Now, that's what I call Will's funniest mom.  I was just going to give her the prize.  At least she's a good dresser, at least. 
[03:21:30]  That's nice.  It's like one of an E-Rod shirt.  27 times in one week.  That's nice, though.  She looks, yeah.  That's a goer.  At 13, you see anything, you get a rod.  She looks like Jimmy Page.  No, that's psychologically damaging, that one.  Fat Jimmy Page.  She looks like Eddie Trunk.  Oh, God.  She looks like Eddie Trunk.  Yeah, that was disgusting.  Survey.  She sucked his cock to a Queensryche song. 
[03:22:00]  You sucked his cock.  I sucked his cock to Queensryche.  To Queensryche.  It's more cocky than yours.  Urban teens losing their virginity very early.  A new survey shows four out of ten kids said they had intercourse before 14.  And have engaged in oral sex and even anal sex by 17.  Yo, sweetheart.  Yo, why don't you, you know, chill with us?  Isn't that amazing?  Inner city.  A lot of inner city.  42% engaged in vaginal intercourse at the age of 14. 
[03:22:30]  How did my joke get nothing?  I was reading a study.  Oh, you said when they were 14.  I went, wow, by second grade?  Oh, okay.  Very funny.  That was a good one.  You know how to bring that back.  That's why I tried to bring it back.  He brought it back.  That's very funny.  That one's funny.  Yeah, when you can pull the alarm and still get it, it's funny.  Right.  All right, we got two more clips.  America's Funniest Mom, season two.  This is Angie.  I got some confessions to make and some secrets to tell.  Hi, I'm Angie Montgomery.  Oh, I know what you expect me to say.  I'm big and sexy. 
[03:23:00]  I'm here to tell you I'm just big.  I think when a woman has kids, the laughs just begin.  That's why I got to stay on my son.  He wants to be a thug.  But I told him, uh-uh.  You can't be no thug and have asthma.  That's not funny.  That's not funny.  That was kind of funny, though.  That was funny.  The only time it's funny when your kid is born, when the comedy begins, is if they say,  look, he has a syndrome. 
[03:23:30]  Then the jokes can fly.  The laughter can start.  You mean that tongue's always going to hang out?  Jesus.  That's right.  Congratulations.  It's a dope.  And you know why it's even funny when Norton says it?  Because he was so close, genetically, to being one of them.  Oh, no.  I'm a very smart guy.  No, but I'm saying, you're just one thing off.  Like, you look visually.  Something happened at the last minute, you're saying? 
[03:24:00]  Yes, because everything lined up perfectly at the last second.  Yeah, you know, Jim, you might actually have that thing where you have an extra chromosome.  It's like when Hooper...  You can be Down syndrome and still be mentally efficient.  He does look like a Down syndrome.  He looks more like fetal alcohol.  Remember when Hooper was tying the knot on the barrel right before it went off the boat?  Got it, dude.  Mike, that's what happened to you at the last minute.  No, Jim doesn't have fetal alcohol syndrome.  After his mother saw him, then she started drinking.  Well, I'm glad you're all having fun at my expense.  We were just making fun of retarded people. 
[03:24:30]  Not you.  No, I wasn't.  I was making fun of retarded babies.  They're far more humorous because...  Will you please find out the girl's address?  She's a victim of something horrible.  I'm an easy target.  Go on, hurt me.  Go on, hurt me.  That's who that teacher looked like, Del Griffith.  I'm an easy target.  It's true.  The kid talked to her a shower curtain ring.  Be quiet.  Voice is doing his homework.  What are you doing on that fucking cell phone?  What are you writing? 
[03:25:00]  Bonnie gives him a little assignment every day.  Don't use those smart words.  He's trying...  He has to look up every word like Malcolm X did in prison.  He's still an aardvark.  Here's the last clip, thank God.  America's Funniest Moments.  I want to see the hour of your report.  I'm Karen Morgan.  I'm the mother of three.  My husband, I have to explain, is from Boston.  Oh, boy.  And I'm from Georgia, so our children are bilingual. 
[03:25:30]  Bonnie, you're ready.  We were in that grocery store not too long ago, y'all, and this man passed gas on the  snack aisle, and my son says, Mama, that man just fired it next to the Tata chips.  My set went great, and the audience was wonderful.  Had a good night.  I have three little kids.  At my house, you just go to your closet in the morning and put on the very first thing  that strikes your fancy, like maybe a bathing suit with a Christmas sweater, tiara, and  some fairy wings.  And then you just go out, and that's my boys. 
[03:26:00]  Ah, kids are faggots.  Yeah.  That's funny, too.  But the potato chips, that's always a killer.  You can just see her walking out, trying to be funny, wearing like her, powered by caffeine  t-shirt on stage.  We're done with that dumb problem.  God.  Sounds like a fat house, doesn't it?  Yes.  Yeah, they're all big, big fat.  I got the one Puerto Rican, Lisa Alvarado.  Yeah.  She's good looking.  You ever see her?  Let's go to Travis.  Travis.  She's good looking.  I can't believe you guys are getting paid for this. 
[03:26:30]  For, you know.  Why?  I know.  We're single.  You guys are just laughing and having a blast.  Stop picking on Jimmy.  I'm punching out.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  We can all have a good time.  But not at each other's expense.  That's my point.  Oh, God.  I used to hate that about Tough Crowd.  This idiot shithead would be on, cracking on me, the host, making fun of how awful I  am.  Then I'd make one joke and all his dumb fans are like, oh, that's kind of quite easy.  Yeah, you're right.  Just notice that, you morons.  That's the way it is.  And I know what you wanted to ask me, and I'll explain it to you.  What? 
[03:27:00]  What?  What?  April 7th.  Tickets go on sale for my Boston date with David Tell, May the 12th, at the Orpheum.  And May, April the 8th, my tickets go on sale for my Borgata date with David Tell, May  13th.  That was really confusing.  May 13th.  It's on your website, though, I bet.  I'll tell my MySpace.  I'm going to have to go to that one.  MySpace.  Borgata.  You guys should use me.  I'm selling out 150 seats sometimes in Houston.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Did you do 150 in Houston?  Yeah, I'm not kidding around.  You did better than that.  Houston's a tough place to bring people in. 
[03:27:30]  At that last stop.  Where were you at?  The last stop.  The last place.  Oh, boy.  He just didn't.  No.  No, I'm telling you.  Houston's a tough.  We were there right after the door.  Put your headphones on correctly.  No, my ear.  The cyst is killing me behind my ear.  Oh, no.  Oh, the stinky cysts.  No, this is a new one on this side.  What?  You got a new one.  Keep smoking.  It's healthy.  Smoking out of your ear.  I'll tell you, you got to quit smoking.  You really are.  I am going to.  I'm going to set a date.  I'm going to give you my...  We're going to exchange numbers and maybe we'll have some chats.  I'm going to set a date.  It's going to coincide with the one on your tombstone.  You have a tumor farm behind your ear. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, God.  You're farming tumors.  He's got a point.  Fucking...  They're like pods.  Sometimes a little visual image like that can help you quit.  Yeah.  That's right.  A tumor farm.  Yeah.  I think you have a tumor farm on your neck.  All right.  I don't think we have anything else, do we?  We haven't since 9.30.  Since Colin showed up.  Oh, boy.  We actually were pretty intelligent there for a while.  No.  What were you guys talking about?  The fact that you and every 57?  I'm just messing with you.  I'm really not.  Yeah, 757 turbine blades. 
[03:28:30]  Look, you guys can laugh all you want.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I prefer more than...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  You said all I want.  That's right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm happy young, baby.  I'm happy young, baby.  I'm happy young, baby.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo. 
[03:29:00]  Let me correct that.  You can laugh until it annoys me.  Hey, let's say hi to Doug out Doug real fast.  Doug, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys, I just want to plug the new Pest Radio Show on Howard 101.  From 8 p.m. to 12 midnight.  Have you guys been getting a lot of calls, too, on a stupid Pharrell?  It is fucking horrendous how we're smashing him nonstop.  We've got a contract.  We're going to be on there every night for the next two years. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, the Pest got signed to Sirius.  Hey, dude, is he dumping out like a fucking faggot?  Who is Pharrell?  Who is Pharrell?  Exactly.  He is fucking horrendous.  He used to be a friend of the show until he turned on us like everyone does.  A lot of people have turned on us lately, Colin.  Colin, thank you.  Exactly, except for you.  Thank God, I hope he invited me on the show.  Hey, why don't you stop by?  Come here whenever you want.  Shut up.  You have no power to say it.  I had the power to say it.  You don't have the authority.  You and Eric can exchange fucking hairdos.  You don't have the authority. 
[03:30:00]  I thought that would get a good laugh, but I forced it.  God damn it.  Go on.  Why can't you just let me slide?  Come on, hurt me.  For all time's sake, Tom.  Can't you force a laugh?  For all time's sake.  Sorry, Jim.  Can't do it.  All right, Doug, what else?  Yeah, he's trying not to take as many calls.  His whole first hour the other night, he played about 14 songs and did that fucking singing.  He did that for an hour straight the other night, just so he wouldn't take any calls. 
[03:30:30]  No one could be enjoying that piece of shit radio show.  Only 10 seconds left.  Where are you going to be?  Cleveland Improv this week.  Banana Poughkeepsis.  Voss and Bonnie at Cleveland Improv, but Norton at Banana Poughkeepsis.  But Voss in Cleveland, but not at Bananas with Me.  Colin Clark, nowhere.  It will be an Anthony show. </pre>
