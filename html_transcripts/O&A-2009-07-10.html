<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of Juliette Lewis's tardiness on the *Cape Fear* set and Robert De Niro's reaction, followed by celebratory comments on their prominent placement in a SiriusXM app launch ad in the *New York Post*.  This transitioned into a humorous segment about the arrest of poorly-costumed Superman and Batman impersonators in Times Square.  Opie then revealed a shocking self-inflicted incident: he'd eaten gum he found on his shoe (possibly dog feces), resulting in severe diarrhea and a subsequent discussion about Gatorade.  The hosts then launched into a crude critique of photos of Demi Moore and Pamela Anderson, focusing on their physical appearances and featuring lengthy, disparaging commentary on a nude video of Pamela Anderson.

A caller brought up Mad Dog Russo's reported outburst, leading to a desire to hear the audio.  The show revisited their controversial opinion on Paris Jackson's emotional display at Michael Jackson's memorial, suggesting it was staged and speculating on Blanket's paternity.  They continued criticizing the memorial service, describing it as a staged spectacle and expressing concern for Blanket, whom they depicted as fearful and withdrawn, even suggesting a Google bomb centered on "Blanket hates the light."

The next segment focused on movie trailers for "Orphan" and "The Unborn," with studio guest E-Roc possibly present, along with reactions from the hosts and Jimmy Norton's expressed displeasure. This led to tangents about other horror films, including *The Exorcist*, Vincent Price movies, *The Ring*, *Nightmare on Elm Street*, and comparisons between "Orphan" and *The Omen*.  A surprise call from Hayden Panettiere, seemingly orchestrated by E-Roc, created excitement and speculation.

The "Blanket Hates the Light" Google Bomb trend was revisited, alongside a discussion of Chris Jericho's retirement announcement and his appearance on their *Z-Rock* show. Humorous anecdotes from *Z-Rock* outtakes were shared, including one involving a host running through children.  The hosts engaged in sexually charged commentary regarding a photo of President Obama seemingly looking at a young woman's buttocks,  imagining his internal monologue.  Listener calls offered updates on the "Blanket" storyline, and the hosts discussed their upcoming *Z-Rock* appearance.  A substantial portion detailed the romantic woes of SiriusXM employee Bobo, his ill-conceived comedy bits, and his appearance.  Derek's heavy drinking was also mentioned, along with a Kevin Smith tweet about his sex life,  and Sam's accessing Bobo's email password. The segment ended with calls to a psychic show and further commentary on the Obama photo and the "Blanket" storyline.

A subsequent segment featured a female psychic show guest, Christina, and crude jokes from the hosts and Sam.  Bobo's obsessive pursuit of Christina was a recurring theme, highlighted by numerous unsolicited calls and voicemails played on air.  A missing studio TV (believed to be with Alex Bennett) and a "social experiment" involving Bobo nearly assaulting intern Fat Matt were discussed.  Christina detailed her work, including a story about locating a missing child, and her romantic life, with attempts by the hosts to set her up with Anthony. The segment concluded with Anthony and Christina exchanging numbers on air, to Bobo's evident distress.

The final segment centered on a phone call with Bobo and Christina, discussing their upcoming date featuring an oversized burger and a stay at the "Queen's Motor Inn" ("highway of death").  Bobo's awkward attempts at romance and repeated use of crude phrases were highlighted.  Christina described Bobo's drawn-on mustache, and callers riffed on Bobo's dating strategies.  The conversation included unrelated topics, such as a caller's anecdote about seeing Michael Jackson's body and a plug for Christina's radio show.  The segment closed with praise for Bobo's comedic value and Christina's participation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, enough palaver.  The palaver is over. The show begins.  We're palaverous.  We've been palavering.  Palavered. Palaverless.  Looking at really hot pictures of Juliette Lewis.  Juliette Lewis.  She's popping in our minds, I guess, today.  Well, I think she might do the show. I'm hoping she does the show. We said yes to her.  Yeah.  She's got a band that she's really into that travels the world. 
[00:00:30]  Are they good?  They're not bad.  Yeah.  Because usually when you hear of like a Hollywood star.  You mean like Dog Star?  Dog Star. Keanu?  Ah, very good.  Keanu Reeves, right?  When you hear these Hollywood people starting up a rock band, most of the time you're like,  She's not, she's alright, man.  Not too shabbly.  Not too bad.  I heard a story about her Jonathan was telling us.  And we were in L.A.  They talked about Juliette Lewis when she was shooting Cape Fear.  Ah, yes.  And she had done something before that. 
[00:01:00]  And she was very young and very hot in Hollywood.  Gilbert Grape.  Yeah, okay, this probably was Gilbert Grape.  Yeah.  And she was being a bit, you know, a bit twatty.  Oh.  Not showing up on set on time.  Wow.  And Jessica Lange and De Niro and fucking Nick Nolte all waiting.  And he said that De Niro had to take her aside and give a little talking to him.  Really?  He said he wasn't bad to her.  But he said that De Niro didn't mention himself.  But apparently this is what he said, that she came one time late and De Niro took her aside 
[00:01:30]  and said, you know, you should be on time.  You should have said, who the fuck are you?  Well, he said, you can't have Nick and Jessica, you know, waiting like that for you.  And he didn't mention himself.  He had an ulterior motive.  He wanted to practice that thumb sucking scene.  Well, it's got to be embarrassing when you're fucking trying to.  Look, we're going to be on film soon.  So why don't we go into the trailer and practice this a little bit?  Wow.  He really gave her a little talking.  Yeah, but it was kind of cool.  He didn't mention himself.  He mentioned Jessica Lange.  And I think that straightened her right out. 
[00:02:00]  You don't want to leave them waiting.  Dude, how embarrassing.  And besides.  Whoa.  What is that from?  Hello there.  She was in Strange Days?  I forgot.  Let me see her weird looking face.  You forget some shit.  She's a weird looking girl, but she's sexy.  Well, she's very weird looking.  Sometimes she looks weird and sometimes she looks really, really sexy.  She looks like James Gumm from Sean and Son of the Lambs in that picture.  She's got a little of that going on.  I like the From Dusk Till Dawn.  She was good in that one.  I forgot she was in that.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, sure.  Played the daughter.  Ant, we got to pet the dog today?  Pet the dog.  Now we pet the dog today.  Sometimes we have to, what, you say?  Roll up the newspaper and swat the dog on the nose.  And when we mean dog, we mean Sirius.  Sirius.  It's a little doggy, see?  Let's stop saying XM.  We understand.  Yeah, it's serious.  XM lost.  It's serious.  Let's be real here.  First page in the New York Post, there's a big ad for the app.  Yes.  The SiriusXM app, which I hear is over one million downloads already. 
[00:03:00]  Over one million.  Which is crazy, because I think it's only been out a couple weeks, right?  Only a couple of weeks.  And then you think of the amount of people that have the iPhones and the amount of people  that are actually downloading this app.  It's amazing.  Quite amazing.  Yeah, definitely.  Oh, Jesus.  What's going on there?  Bush.  There?  Big, hairy bush.  Oh, no.  What's that from?  Renegade?  Renegade.  Never heard of it.  Never heard of it, sir.  It's a great underwater naked picture of Juliette Lewis. 
[00:03:30]  So the SiriusXM advertising for the app is a full-page ad today.  And in the comedy section, it says Opie and Anthony.  And it is the front.  It is the first name in the all-comedy, all the time.  From family-friendly laughs to raw, uncensored comedy.  And there it is.  The first one listed out of the four listed under the comedy category is the Opie and Anthony show.  And it should be the first one.  Yes, of course. 
[00:04:00]  We like being in the comedy category.  So they listen to us.  Holy crap, they listen to us.  I know.  I can't believe it.  A lot of times I go home, man, we bitched and complained a lot.  I really wish one day they would actually listen to us.  But that's why we must pet the dog today.  Yeah, we're petting the dog.  We're petting the dog because I don't want them to think we don't notice things like this,  that we only notice the bad things, and that we roll up the paper and swat the dog on the nose all the time. 
[00:04:30]  Now we go, good boy, good boy, come here, come here, good boy, you scratch under his chin.  Do we give him a treat today?  Yeah, give him a little treat.  All right, we'll give you five more minutes of radio today.  That's what we do.  Five extra minutes for Sirius XM for what they did.  All right, we'll go to ten.  I want big 3D font.  I'm not happy with that.  You're not happy with that, Jimmy?  I want 3D font.  3D font. 
[00:05:00]  How great is it?  I want a hologram.  How great is it we force them to make Opie and Anthony the biggest thing on that whole page?  Good boy.  Even though they're trying to promote the Sirius XM app, make the Opie and Anthony ten times bigger.  There's actually a really good billboard for it.  Yeah, Midtown Tunnel, coming out of the Midtown Tunnel.  Also by the Lincoln Tunnel, when you're leaving the best, probably the best commuter billboard space.  It's right where HBO used to have, or still has their billboard, leaving the city.  There's not a lot of people that see that billboard, though.  Is it by the Jam?  No, not really.  Is the Jam Cam on top? 
[00:05:30]  The Jam Cam?  No, that's coming inbound.  Ah.  This is outbound in New York.  The Jam Cam.  They have one downtown.  Whoever did the billboard placement decisions really picked some fucking good ones.  Yes, so it's definitely being seen by a lot of people.  Leaving Manhattan, coming onto the Long Island Expressway.  It's right there.  Right?  Out of the Midtown Tunnel.  That's a really good placement there.  That's good.  It's money well spent.  Yes.  I sound like my aunt now.  Yes.  Money well spent. 
[00:06:00]  Well, Kevin from Connecticut is getting out.  Penny saved is a dollar earned or something.  We're all over.  What?  Dollar saved is a penny what?  No, no, no.  Penny saved is a penny earned.  All right.  Good idea.  Who cares?  It's true.  Ew.  Who are we going to?  It's all right.  I was just going to say, Kevin said from Connecticut, I'm getting out the peanut butter for the dog  because, you know.  Oh, no, no.  That's not good for the dog. 
[00:06:30]  Why not?  That's good for us.  It's good for the dog, too.  You got to think of it.  The dog loves peanut butter.  What else is he doing with his stupid day?  He doesn't know what he's doing when he's licking that peanut butter up.  Artie in Brooklyn.  How are you?  Hey, boys.  I just got a new car, and I had serious with it.  Now, I can't add on to XM, but that's a different story altogether.  But they sent me something in the mail, and there's a best of XM, and there's a picture of Opie and Anthony there.  Good.  Oprah, you, and, I don't know, maybe Major League Baseball or something. 
[00:07:00]  Look at that.  We're getting some things done, finally.  Pet the dog.  Pet the dog.  Pet the dog.  You're a good boy.  You got to praise them or they get confused.  Look, I know we have a lot to do today, but could one person call and explain why the cops were battling Superman and Batman and Times Square yesterday? 
[00:07:30]  I've read the article twice, and I don't understand this.  I'll tell you why.  And I don't even know what the story is.  Nope.  Don't know the story, but I'll tell you exactly why.  Okay.  Because Times Square is turning into Nutville again.  It's turning into Kooky Town again, like it was before the economy got good and then before it went to shit again.  That's impossible. 
[00:08:00]  They got beach chairs out there.  Exactly.  It's the dumbest thing.  It's turning into a wacky, wackyville.  And I see some shady shenanigans going on there.  But these look like college kids.  I think the – oh, that's a female cop.  Okay.  They're tackling Superman, and they got Batman all cuffed up on one of the freaking lawn chairs.  Look at the cop.  How come superheroes are so easy to conquer in real life? 
[00:08:30]  The cops get them, like, easily.  Biff Wham Pow is the headline.  Yeah.  It's on the front page.  The front page of the paper is talking about this.  The Man of Steel didn't go down with just two officers.  It took seven officers to get Superman down.  He was putting up a good fight.  Little kids were like, Mommy, it's Superman.  I guess they were a little, you know, little kids probably going to get upset. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  If that wasn't weird enough, the Dark Knight was handcuffed in a chair like a common villain.  As it was happening, someone was like, it's Batman.  Is it?  Do people not realize these are just lunatics in suits?  Is it really Batman?  Just lunatics in suits.  The Batman character didn't even go the distance and put on a, you know, a face thing.  Yeah.  And Superman looks ridiculous. 
[00:09:30]  Superman, a.k.a.  Maxim Katznelson, 23, in the Bronx.  He was arrested and charged with assault and resisting arrest.  Police said he punched a female cop in the face while she was trying to subdue him.  Okay.  And the cop is fine after being punched by Superman?  Amazing.  She must have had some kryptonite.  I'm still looking for the reason.  All right.  Their comic book adventure went awry when cops approached the Dynamic Duo on 43rd Street 
[00:10:00]  to see whether they had the required license to perform in costume in public.  When they said no, cops asked for IDs.  Again, they answered no, which prompted them to handcuff Batman.  Superman, that's when Superman took off, screaming, I'm not getting arrested.  Just like the real Superman.  I'm not getting arrested.  But a crowd of police took him down and brought him to a special Fortress of Solitude, the Midtown 
[00:10:30]  South Station House.  Oh, get it?  Meanwhile, Batman left with another costume character.  Said Melba Williams, a tourist from Tennessee.  He walked off with the Statue of Liberty.  I guess...  This needed to be on page three of my paper today.  Yeah.  I guess the Michael Jackson thing's calmed down enough where...  Well, not really.  They don't need 20 pages.  Not really.  Well, maybe they don't need 20 pages. 
[00:11:00]  And they could put Superman and Batman on the page two.  I'm more concerned that the world is getting close to blowing up.  And they have a story about Superman and Batman.  Fake Superman and Batman.  By the way, what an awful Batman costume this guy is wearing.  Horrendous.  It really is terrible.  It's horrible.  He looks nothing like Batman.  Fake muscles.  It's got the built-in muscles and lats.  Would you ever wear that?  No.  He's got built-in abs and lats. 
[00:11:30]  And his bad Batman boots that are actually just part of the pants.  Because you can see his...  Sneakers.  His crappy sneakers on the bottom.  What an awful costume.  What a horrendous story.  To be arrested just for an awful Batman costume.  So I guess you need a permit to do that.  To walk around in costume.  How do you get that?  How do you go to even get that?  Because I know in Hollywood, everywhere you go, there's a costumed asshole taking pictures 
[00:12:00]  and charging you like eight to ten bucks a clip for photos with various, you know, Abbott and Costello lookalikes.  Yeah, yeah.  You go down there by a man's Chinese theater.  And you get all the old Hollywood starlets and actors.  They're all there.  Terminator is down there.  And you take pictures with him.  I guess they don't want Times Square turning into that.  Because they got the naked cowboy.  I guess he's got a permit.  Oh, great.  He must have a permit.  So glad that he's protected.  And then we get to see his stupid fucking saggy ass. 
[00:12:30]  Him and his big cock.  Does he have a big cock?  I don't know.  They made him wear two pairs of underwear.  Well, something's going on then.  Because the outline of his schween was showing.  Really?  And yeah, the police deemed it obscene.  So they made him wear two pairs of underwear.  I'm extremely dehydrated.  So if I pass out during the show.  What happened?  I'm out of sorts today.  I've been... 
[00:13:00]  Remember when I put...  I think...  What?  What?  What?  What?  And they just took his water.  Like, it was near my side.  He just went, it's mine.  I wasn't touching it.  I know.  I licked the top before.  And that's...  I've been shitting water for two straight days.  And then I'm like, what the hell did I eat that could have caused this?  And I'm going through my diet and everything is pretty normal and basic and not too crazy.  Yeah.  And then I remember a little thing I did on the show.  I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday.  Uh-huh.  Tuesday. 
[00:13:30]  Yep.  Where I pulled, like, some really rank gum off the bottom of my shoe.  Well, you didn't know if it was gum, gack, gum, gutter gack, or dog shit?  It turned out to be gum.  It was dark black.  Oh, dude.  And I put it in my mouth to get a quick laugh from Jimmy and Ant.  It worked.  A quick cheap laugh.  I'll acknowledge that.  It worked.  And for the last two days, I've been basically shitting pure water it's down to now.  Pure effing water. 
[00:14:00]  I feel so dehydrated right now.  I feel so dry.  Is it clear, like this bottle of Fuji water I'm holding?  Is that how it comes out?  Pretty much.  Just crystal clear.  Pretty much.  Spring water.  I mean, if you want me to get real graphic, there's a slight color, but barely any color.  Like when they work on the pipes in your neighborhood?  And you first turn them back on?  Yeah.  That's exactly a very good way to look at it.  Slight.  Yeah.  A little discoloration.  Yeah.  I'm almost out of it. 
[00:14:30]  You know, because you know that, because then it starts going the other way.  Yeah, yeah.  That's getting solid.  But I'm really dehydrated.  What do I do?  A Gatorade?  Yeah, you should probably get some lights in you.  Electro lights?  Kenny, can I get a Gatorade?  Sure.  What color?  I don't give a shit.  Any color will do.  I prefer the red.  I got to get some fluids in me.  Pronto.  Or I'm going to pass out.  Pronto.  Oh, wow.  It's a little, what's her name?  Who's that?  Hermione. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, wow.  She's growing up, huh?  Yeah.  They're all growing up.  Little Harry Potter showing his dick on stage there and Equus.  Why don't they?  You see the Demi Moore picture, by the way?  Which one?  Is that her?  Dude, look at that.  I mean, not that.  Thank you.  Demi Moore on vacation in the Caribbean.  40, what are they calling her?  46 years old?  Ridiculous body.  Obviously, she gets like the, you know, all the procedures.  Lipo and she's got some tits.  Well, she's got the really nice breast job. 
[00:15:30]  Tiny flat stomach.  Look at that body.  Got to give it to her.  Let me see another pic.  We got some extras down there.  Let's see another angle.  Yeah, that one.  Huh?  Bad ankles?  Hillary?  You're saying bad ankles?  I said angles.  Oh, angles.  Bad angles.  Let's see.  Every shot they have makes me look like Sasquatch or something.  She's all right, man.  Demi Moore?  Oh, my God.  Her body looks good, man.  I always liked her.  Always.  Ashton Kutcher's still banging that, huh? 
[00:16:00]  He's still hanging in there.  He's still hanging in there.  What a trooper.  Now, Demi Moore looks great for her age.  Know who looks horrendous for her age?  Um...  We were talking about it yesterday, off-air.  Oh, look at that.  Pam Anderson looks horrendous for her age.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be said.  Yeah.  How old is Demi Moore and how old is Pam Anderson?  They've got to be about the same age.  45?  I think Demi Moore is 46.  Pam Anderson's got to be close to that, right?  Got to be.  Right?  She's 46? 
[00:16:30]  Maybe not that old.  Younger?  She better be 46.  Because of the picture we saw yesterday.  Yeah.  But she's, you know, ridden hard and put up wet.  Many a time.  That Tommy Lee dick will fucking age you.  That alone.  And she's still trying to dress the part of Pam Anderson?  That you don't.  I mean, what is she to do, you know?  She's known for the chick that's really hot showing off her body all the time. 
[00:17:00]  She's got to start wearing pants, suits, and sensible shoes.  Just like the old athlete.  You've got to know when it's over.  You've got to know.  You've got to know.  Retire.  I'm retiring.  I'm retiring, tiring, tiring, from being a whore, whore, whore.  I've found I can't be a slut anymore, more, more.  I consider myself the luckiest slut bag on the face of the earth. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, what is that?  That is not her.  The headline for the picture is, can I help you, ma'am?  Holy fuckaroni.  What the?  I mean, I know what happened to her.  She got older.  Yeah.  You've got to start covering that shit up, man.  Gravity.  Goddamn.  Gravity.  Can I help you, ma'am?  What side is that?  She used to be the hottest girl, woman on the planet.  That was the go-to name whenever you wanted to talk about some hot chick. 
[00:18:00]  And she still works it like she's hot.  You're not hot anymore.  Look at her moving her hair and her body like she's still.  She's trying.  Like she still has it.  Let's see.  What is she?  Oh.  She's like a big block body.  What is, what is it?  What was this for, by the way?  Some kind of fashion show or something.  Just an appearance?  Yeah.  Is that what she does?  She just shows up and.  During our fashion week.  And now she's going with the one piece, too.  As soon as you can't pull off the two piece when you're in that world, you've got to stop. 
[00:18:30]  Because everyone's going to notice, well, whoa, why are you wearing the one piece?  Oh, she's looking really blocky.  What do you mean blocky?  Just no figure?  Like no figure anymore.  There's nothing going on there.  Right.  People are saying I need the vitamin water over the Gatorade.  Could we get vitamin water, too?  Who's saying that?  And it's not smart I'm drinking coffee, but I'm addicted to coffee, so I've got to get a cup down.  Yeah, it's diuretic, as they say.  What do you think of the Pamela Anderson?  She's disgusting at this point. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  She should be, yeah.  She should just dress like an older woman.  Well, I mean, not even, I don't know.  Yeah, she's got to start dressing like.  I think she should just, you know, give up on the bathing suit.  Pamela Anderson is um.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know what it is, though?  She's known for Baywatch, so she shows up in the bathing suit.  Mm-hmm.  And it doesn't quite look like it did in Baywatch. 
[00:19:30]  She wasn't even the hottest girl on Baywatch.  Who was?  Who was that other one there, Danny?  Hasselhoff.  Hasselhoff.  The Hoff.  The Hoff.  The Hoff rules on America.  He's got talent.  What a nut job.  The Hoff.  Who was the one that was in Charles in Charge?  Yeah, I think that's the one I'm talking about.  You're saying Nicole Eggert?  Yes.  Nicole Eggert.  She was hot for about 15 minutes.  She was hotter on that show is what I'm saying.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Very hot.  A little while.  Why is that side called What Would Tyler Durden Do, by the way?  Is there a backstory on that?  He's a huge fan of the show, but he doesn't want to come on our show.  I just don't know.  Why is it called that?  Danny could ask him.  What would Tyler Durden do?  Yeah, he could be a fan of it, but what does it mean?  Who's not a fan of Fight Club?  I've never seen it, but I mean, I would like to see it.  Jimmy, I've got to bring it in for you.  It's one of my favorite movies.  You've never seen Fight Club?  You're out of your mind.  Not that I don't want to see it.  Leave.  I don't want to go.  I like being here. 
[00:20:30]  I just haven't seen it.  You've got to read Fight Club.  I want to see it first.  She always likes to read it after.  No, reading.  I know we're all Twittering, but I want to say hi to one of my biggest followers, Chuck  Polinook.  Hello, Chuck.  Oh, really?  Chuck Polinook is following OP Radio.  Yes, he is.  Not the real Chuck Polinook.  He knows that I'm a fan.  Holy fuck.  Who is that?  That's Pam Anderson.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  Fucking Ian Anderson.  All right. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  I'm telling you.  It's sad.  Blow that up.  I've got to see that bigger.  And she's got kids that are old enough that are going to be embarrassed.  When you've got young kids, they don't know any better, but now they're like, oh my God.  Mom's going out of the house in that one piece.  Oh my God.  It's Tippi Pam.  I was just going to say that.  Oh man, what the fuck?  She's starting to look. 
[00:21:30]  I don't think she looks bad for 45.  I mean, she looks like Hedda Nussbaum.  Jimmy, she doesn't look bad for 45, but when she's in that world, you know what I mean?  Yeah, that's just it.  You can't age in that world.  No.  That's why some of these older starlets, they just went away and never wanted to be seen  again.  His old sex pot.  Bridget Bardot doesn't like being in public.  No.  In the public view.  I want to be alone.  What about her?  There's been a few of them that said, you know what?  I know what my job was in this world. 
[00:22:00]  I was the sexy, sexy, sexy babe.  Sex kitten.  Sex kitten.  And they're old, old cougars.  Yeah.  Now I got to go away.  No one is supposed to see me in old age or older age.  Certainly not old age.  Yeah.  That's a God.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Oh God bless you.  Tyson for reminding me of this one.  Tyson in Toronto.  Hey guys.  Hey Tyson.  Not that Tyson.  Pam Anderson.  Oh sorry.  Great Jimmy.  Sorry.  Sorry Ant. 
[00:22:30]  There's this video where Pam Anderson is delivering a cake to Hugh Hefner and she's got to like  turn her kitty inside out or something.  It is fucked.  Yeah.  There was.  Gotta find it.  I watched The Girls Next Door or whatever the hell it was called.  That silly show about the Playboy Mansion and Hugh Hefner and all.  Yeah.  And Pam Anderson would show up every once in a while and she got naked.  And they pixelated the hell out of it.  But you could still tell that.  The world would hurt.  She was getting naked in front of the young 20 year olds that Hef has around all the time. 
[00:23:00]  Oh Jiminy Cricket.  You don't want to do that.  And it was kind of awkward to watch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they were giving her the almost the.  Polite applause.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like oh that's nice.  It's so nice you would do that for Hef.  Thank you sir.  Oh is that it?  Leave it to fucking the English papers.  England doesn't give a shit right?  See what happened.  God damn it. 
[00:23:30]  Can we talk to the women?  Can we talk to the women?  When you get to.  Look at her.  When you get the breast implants.  Yeah.  You can't have the nipples way up high with a ton of.  A ton of breast meat on the bottom.  Breast meat below.  No.  It looks ridiculous.  You got to know what size you can handle.  Right?  It's got to be in proportion still.  Yeah.  Or that makes a bad tit job.  Sometimes they just look better in clothes also.  There she is.  Pam Anderson. 
[00:24:00]  Completely naked.  Handing him his birthday cake.  With.  Horrible.  Big tits.  When was this by the way?  That was about a year ago.  Yeah.  I think.  Yeah.  It was her last hurrah.  I guess.  Look at him.  She's kissing him on the mouth.  Tits are hanging out.  She's playing with him.  She don't know what to do with her tits.  All right. 
[00:24:30]  We'll move on from poor Pam.  Yeah.  All the youngsters are just gathered all around looking at her like, oh boy.  Yeah.  That's what's going to happen.  Matt in Virginia.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, I don't know if you guys heard Mad Dog yesterday, but he lost his mind yesterday  afternoon on his entire staff claims he might fire all of them and just do the channel  by himself.  I don't know if you got the audio on it, but.  Really?  What happened?  Something must have happened because, yeah, my Twitter blew up.  People were saying, are you listening to Mad Dog? 
[00:25:00]  And unfortunately, I was not.  So maybe we could get a piece of audio.  He's not a yeller, man.  He's not.  I mean, he's not.  Supposedly, he really lost his mind yesterday.  He went nuts.  I'd love to hear audio of that because he's never a dick.  No.  Except off the air.  He's very mean.  I listen to it.  What is his channel called here at SiriusXM?  Is it Mad Dog Radio?  Mad Dog Radio.  Is it Mad Dog Radio?  I'm firing everybody.  Get the hell out of my office.  Can't take it anymore.  Somebody miscommunity.  I can't stop.  I threw him out.  Throw him right the hell out. 
[00:25:30]  You can't get Hep C from chewing gum, can you?  Oh, yeah, you probably can.  No, come on.  You can get Hep.  I didn't chew it.  You can get Hep.  You can get Hepatitis A from eating ass.  And money.  I know that.  You should check.  You're probably fine, but you might want to check.  You should get it from a paper cut from money.  Is that curable?  Hepatitis A, yes.  Which one?  A is curable, I believe.  Watch Dr. Steve Collins.  I'm totally wrong, man.  So I put dark black gum from my shoe in my mouth, and now I've been crapping water for 
[00:26:00]  two days, but I didn't chew the gum.  And it was sort of more of an illusion than anything.  Yeah, fucking, the germs jump.  Right into my tongue?  They'll just jump right off that gum and go, ooh, look, a moist spot.  Get the fucking, don't get me all fucking paranoid, man.  I don't know, did it touch your mouth?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, it touched your mouth.  A little bit, a little bit.  It's a problem.  A problem.  It started out as green poopies. 
[00:26:30]  Mad Dog Radio.  Thanks for asking.  Yeah, we'll get the Mad Dog clip as well.  Pretty pissed off over here.  Why don't we do your Michael Jackson update, and then we'll move on.  Oh, you mean my vindication?  We're fading out of the Michael Jackson stuff, thank God.  Thank God.  Just in time for the big guy to come back from vacation.  Ah.  Oh, people are asking me, wherever I went, you know, they want me to comment on the SiriusXM app, do they? 
[00:27:00]  Sorry, I can't help myself.  Wherever I went, they were asking me about two things, the SiriusXM app and the Michael Jackson thing.  Here's my thoughts.  Eight weeks later.  It's been a while.  Well, I know you like it, too.  Paris Jackson, impromptu or planned?  Thank you.  Do I owe Anthony an apology?  We all saw Michael Jackson's kid, Paris Jackson, crying at the end of the memorial. 
[00:27:30]  I caught a lot of heat yesterday.  A lot of heat I caught because I said it looked a little staged.  There was something going on that was more than met the eye.  And the Jackson family is known to choreograph every single thing they do in public to make it bigger and give them, you know, it's all for their own purposes.  This whole fucking memorial they did was a farce. 
[00:28:00]  It was horrendous.  And now the big closer, the big closer was Paris Jackson, a little 11-year-old Paris Jackson who doesn't share a strand of DNA with Michael or any of the Jackson family.  I think Blanket does, though.  That's my new theory.  Blanket?  Blanket had, in my opinion, black features.  No, he looks more Hispanic or Spanish. 
[00:28:30]  Or Arabian.  Like Spanish, I think.  There's something exotic going on with Blanket, which makes me go, huh?  Carlos.  Because why two kids by the same donors and the third kid different?  Different mom or different something?  He wanted a different look.  He wanted a smorgasbord.  I'm thinking maybe he finally said, you know what?  All right.  All right.  All right, I'll pass my DNA along.  I don't think he could at that point.  Is that what's going to come out?  I don't know.  All right.  Continue.  So Paris went up there.  Chopped his balls off, remember? 
[00:29:00]  Paris went up there and became the most famous person in the world.  By the way, she's dropping down already, like we said.  And I said, wow, you know, that was kind of a cool moment because she humanized Michael Jackson as a human being.  How's Corey Feldman?  He's still hurting, man.  He's still hurting.  He's still hurting.  He's mentioned, by the way, in this.  It's kind of sad to read.  Oh, yes.  Is he mentioned in this?  And Michael Jackson's memorial speakers hardly know him.  And they mentioned Corey.  What?  They say they talk about the memorial speakers.  I didn't know.  They said Brooke, who hadn't talked to him in years. 
[00:29:30]  She last saw Jackson 18 years ago at Elizabeth Taylor's wedding.  Jesus Christ.  And she's crying her eyes out.  Corey Feldman, who befriended Jackson in the 80s, also hadn't talked to the star in several years after having a falling out.  Feldman ended up wearing a Jackson costume to the ceremony.  Because he was hurting.  He was hurting.  He was hurting.  And it says, I'm just drained, he told Us Magazine.  He did not.  He just jerked off?  What?  He was drained.  Oh, I thought he said he was just drained. 
[00:30:00]  What, has he got explosive diarrhea, too?  Yeah, maybe he took some gum off of his Michael Jackson shoe.  Oh, I forgot to, we'll go back to Jimmy in a second.  Like, last night was kind of like a date night.  Really?  Yeah, just three.  Who'd you go with?  That's the beauty of me.  No, and while we're trying to enjoy that sushi joint, you turned me on to Jimmy?  That Gary place?  Yeah, it's great, right?  Well.  Let's hope that's not the source of your troubles.  No, no, no.  I've never had a problem there.  No, no, no, no.  Before I even ordered, I was in the bathroom six times. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, okay.  A table.  Great place.  There was a table there that was convinced I'm a coke head and I was doing coke in the  bathroom because I was getting up during this date night every other minute to unleash  more, more stuff.  Unleash more grime.  It's great sushi.  It was very tasty.  I was going to tweet from my hell in the bathroom.  I should have on date night.  You have liquid doodos. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, doodos.  Yeah.  Anyway, back to Corey Feldman is hurting.  That's all it was.  It was just a simple article.  Like, they're listing people who haven't seen Jackson in many years.  Like, Queen Latifah, who eulogized him, told Letterman that she never actually got to meet  him.  I think she said my partner met him.  I don't know if she, is she gay or is it a business partner?  I don't know.  Dude.  So, wait.  She gave the big speech.  She had one of the big speeches at the memorial and she never met him.  John Mayer never met him.  Never met him.  Freaking Brooke Shields hasn't.  Hadn't seen him in 18 years. 
[00:31:30]  How pathetic was this guy's life?  Holy fuck.  That is amazing.  How pathetic.  It was Jesse Jackson, who counseled the singer during his trial, was not available to speak.  He wasn't present to speak.  A source tells Us Magazine that Joe Jackson dislikes him and made sure Al Sharpton.  That's probably a Joe Jackson call.  He likes Al.  But, okay.  Liz Taylor didn't want to be a part of the public whoopla, which I kind of respect that.  What about Diana Ross? 
[00:32:00]  Same thing.  Diana Ross.  What about Liza Minnelli?  Well, Ross said that she was at the memorial in spirit, but that she declined to, she decided  to pause and be silent because it felt right.  What about Macaulay Culkin?  Why was he so quiet?  They don't say, but they say Macaulay, the no-shows were him.  Ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley, Emanuel Lewis, of course.  These were all the people that were close to Michael Jackson in his heyday.  At some point in his life.  You would think they would have showed up for the memorial.  You know why they didn't show up for the memorial?  Once again, because we're always right.  They have reputations that they're scared shitless to ruin. 
[00:32:30]  You don't want to show up in this circus.  At least Queen Latifah, if anyone calls her out on her and goes, look, I've never even met  the guy.  I never met the motherfucker.  My publicist said this is a good opportunity to get in front of the world.  And I said, all right, let's do this.  Because I think if you never met the guy, then you save face in this whole thing.  Now they say Jennifer Hudson, who performed Will You Be There, had no prior relationship  with Jackson.  Mariah Carey, who she covered I'll Be There.  But she worked with him during a 2001 charity single, but they had minimal, they weren't 
[00:33:00]  close together.  Usher, who sobbed and touched Jackson's coffin while singing Gone Too Soon, performed with  Jackson at his 2001 Celebration Concert at Madison Square Garden.  But their contact was minimal.  The source tells us.  And that's it.  Yeah.  He was crying and touching the friggin' silver coffin, gold coffin, whatever it was.  It all makes sense now.  And then he dramatically pulled his sunglasses off at the end.  Yeah.  This was a big show. 
[00:33:30]  Load of shit.  It all makes sense.  This was a show, a fake show that was put on by the Jackson family, and it started with  them rolling that fuckin' coffin in, and it ended with the daughter who isn't really,  you know, blood daughter, crying.  Mm-hmm.  And then curtain, scene.  You know, Mariah Carey said the reason why she sucked so bad with her performance, because  she was so choked up, because he was right there in front of her. 
[00:34:00]  Just stop it.  Right there in front of her.  Is that what her apology was?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, do it now.  Let's hear it now.  Yeah.  Do it again.  Yeah, do it.  Yeah, exactly.  Now that you're not so choked up.  But it all makes sense.  Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna have a prison, because then I'm sitting there going, wow,  these people are being pretty brave to be on that stage, knowing that we're gonna find  out some shit in the coming months.  Yeah.  And they could just say, look, I didn't even know the guy.  I didn't know.  The eulogy should have been by people who knew him.  Of course.  Yeah.  It's weird, right?  Like, nobody from the family spoke, did they? 
[00:34:30]  I mean, maybe, did Janet Jackson speak?  Did LaToya speak?  Or Tito?  No, no, no.  Marlon spoke at the end.  Jermaine spoke.  The little girl spoke.  That was it for the family.  And Janet didn't get up there?  She's like the second most known Jackson.  Yeah, she went to the other joint after the coverage and talked to the people that, the  lunatics that decided they needed to see this on a screen.  On a big screen.  Next to the Staples Center.  Yeah.  Why would you do that when you could watch it on TV? 
[00:35:00]  She went to those fans?  Yeah, at the end and just talked.  They wanted to be together, Opie, and share their moment of grief.  Great.  It turns out that whole thing was a bunch of opportunists going on stage and, you know,  and getting seen by the world.  That's all.  Get your name out there.  But it brings us back to this speech.  I would have.  I just wanted to say, ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could 
[00:35:30]  ever imagine.  And I just wanted to say I love him so much.  Jesus, Anthony.  Good call, Anthony.  Jesus, Anthony.  Come on.  Well, ah, clam up.  Good call, Anthony.  Wait, this leg has stories. 
[00:36:00]  This story has legs.  Well, if you're talking about Heather Mills, hold it up and make that proclamation.  This leg has stories.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  Give me the Gatorade.  Oh, there it is.  Good.  Paris Jackson and Promptu are planned.  Los Angeles.  E!  Online.  So this comes from a good source.  No doubt Paris Jackson loves and misses her King of Pop, Papa.  But did she really want to tell the world how she felt at Tuesday's memorial service?  A source tells me that the 11-year-old Paris was seen and heard backstage at the Staples 
[00:36:30]  Center telling family members that she did not want to make such a public statement.  She was crying and screaming that she didn't want to do it, says a source.  But the family was telling her she had to.  She had to do it.  I submit to you.  If this comes from E!  Online.  You know what, Ant?  I think I owe you an apology.  Yeah, I think so.  You're not going to get it, but I owe you one.  I submit to you that she was upset.  She was upset because she didn't want to do this.  That's where all that emotion came from, I believe.  Yeah.  A reference family did not immediately comment. 
[00:37:00]  Would a not-so-impromptu family-planned speech by Paris be that surprising?  No way.  This is the Jackson family we're talking about.  They are masters at making headlines.  Michael lived big, so why would his memorial service be any different?  The big message at the memorial, Michael was just like us.  A human being who laughed, cried, and laughed and loved his children unconditionally.  What better way to drive that point home than by ending the more than two-hour service with his daughter?  Michael couldn't have planned it better himself.  Yep. 
[00:37:30]  That's it.  Just an embarrassing end to what became an embarrassing legacy.  Embarrassing life.  Just an embarrassment.  Dude.  Just acting like an asshole.  With this giant fake Academy Award looking, it looked like an award show, his memorial.  Well, I got confused when Magic Johnson and Kobe got up there.  I'm like, wow, what award are they giving out?  Yeah.  Because it had that perfect, like, two-guy, read off the teleprop, make a dumb joke, give 
[00:38:00]  out the award thing.  That's what it looked like.  Like, yeah, the joke, and then what did Magic Johnson tell a story from, like, 1970?  Some chicken story or something.  He's sitting there eating Kentucky Fried Chicken with the Jacksons.  Right.  And playing ball with them back when they were kids.  Yeah.  No one had a current story about this motherfucker.  It's awful.  No one.  And then Kareem Sky hooked, and Mike, did he?  Really?  1984?  And then Brooke Shields gets out and conveys a story from 18 years ago. 
[00:38:30]  No one was able to go, yeah, I was talking to the guy last week, and he said, no.  It was all just shenanigans, everything.  Shenanigans.  Unbelievable.  Oh, you know when they said it came out almost immediately that his body was riddled with needle 
[00:39:00]  marks?  Yes.  Now, like, major sources are saying that.  Major sources.  Yeah.  I believe ABC's one of them.  I believe CNN is one of them.  I don't doubt it.  It's going to come out that his body was riddled with needle marks.  Riddled.  And now they're all openly talking about how he had a major drug problem.  Yep.  That is coming out like crazy.  Joe Jackson made his latest appearance.  Oh, he did?  What is this now?  You're going to love this one.  This guy is another fucking winner.  When last we heard Joe Jackson, he was in such grief and sorrow over the death of his son, 
[00:39:30]  Michael, that he was able to plug a new record label that was coming out to release all of  his material on or some bullshit like that.  And Reverend Al felt like he had to be next to Joe Jackson for this announcement.  Let's not forget that.  He's a family spokesman.  Let's not forget that.  Yeah.  This is what he's saying to ABC News.  As questions continue to swirl about the last hours of Michael Jackson, his father, Joe 
[00:40:00]  Jackson, is speaking out, recalling his reaction on June 25th as he learned that his son was  being rushed to the hospital.  What was going through your heart as you heard this news?  Well, I just couldn't believe what was happening to Michael because I just couldn't believe it,  you know.  And I do believe it was foul play.  I do believe that.  Yes.  Foul play.  Foul play as a foot.  What do you mean by foul play?  Maybe a doctor that Michael had, had done something, maybe given him a... 
[00:40:30]  I think there's going to be an oopsie, but it was all set up by Michael himself.  Michael demanded to have an anesthesiologist on tour with him, all this shit.  Yeah.  And then an oopsie happened.  That's foul play.  All right.  So then maybe Joe Jackson's right.  Oof.  All right.  Jesus, dude.  Help it.  They really should just recast the movie, though.  It's silly now.  They're all just...  The Harry Potter series is amazing. 
[00:41:00]  And actually, the movies aren't bad for adults.  The first one was kind of a kid's movie, but then they realized, look, we could bring  in some adults with some darker shit.  Yeah.  But they got to recast the movie.  These kids are like 30 years old now.  Adults.  I don't even recognize any of them.  They are all adults.  Nana Potter.  I mean, I think the series itself is way bigger than the actors, so just be brave enough  to recast.  Pull a Star Trek. 
[00:41:30]  Why not?  Just recast them.  Why not?  Younger kids.  Get another little kid with little round glasses and keep the story going.  Why not?  Why not?  Franchise is way more important than who's playing the role.  And then Joe Jackson continued.  As world attention now turns to the fate of Michael Jackson's three children, Joe Jackson  leaves no doubt about what he thinks would be best for Paris, Prince Michael, and Blanket.  What do you think he's going to say?  I haven't heard this clip.  It's Joe Jackson.  What would be best for the kids? 
[00:42:00]  He's going to say to send them out on tour all over the world so that people can look  at Michael's kids.  Yes, yes.  And they don't even have to sing.  That's it.  They'll just do a freak show, sideshow type thing with them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See Michael Jackson's kids.  Exactly.  Nice find, Danny.  Who do you think should raise these children now that Michael is gone? 
[00:42:30]  They're my mother, Catherine and I.  Yes, there's no one else.  Catherine and I?  Aren't they separated?  I heard he lives in Vegas and has lived in Vegas for a while.  Catherine and I.  Imagine little Blanket getting his first punch in the face from Joe Jackson as he's telling  him to get on stage and sing, motherfucker, sing.  It would be an honor.  Yeah.  You know, we've spent way too much time on Corey Feldman is hurting.  I want to spend a little time on Blanket and the fact that he is scared of sunlight. 
[00:43:00]  Little petrified Blanket.  Like, Paris looked kind of relatively normal and well-adjusted.  And the other kid was like...  Prince Michael was chewing his gum like a horse, just going, end this already.  End this.  Right.  Plant this motherfucker.  Right.  And give me my trust fund.  I'm done.  But Blanket...  Blanket...  Scared of his own shadow.  Blanket had eyes like those old puppy paintings.  He just was like...  Looking up all scared.  Little blanket. 
[00:43:30]  Frightened little blanket.  Poor blanket.  Poor little blanket.  I feel bad for him.  Doesn't like the sunlight.  Doesn't like people.  It's terrible.  Big, huge anime eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got a little anime.  And I...  Yes, there's no one else to do what we can do for them.  I want you to keep them all together and make them happy and feed them like they're supposed  to be fed. 
[00:44:00]  Knuckle sandwiches?  And let them get dressed, panty, sleep.  We're up to be strong Jacksons.  Strong Jacksons.  You know.  Just like the rest of your family.  Freaks.  You guys want to do this?  Kevin from Connecticut nailed it.  You want to do this?  Another Google bomb today, please.  Which one?  Please humor me.  What are we Google bombing?  Blanket hates the light.  Blanket hates the light.  And go.  Look at little blanket.  Look at him. 
[00:44:30]  He's petrified.  The poor little kid.  He just wants to go back into hiding.  He just wants to hide.  Little blanket is hiding behind cardboard.  And action figures.  The older, what's his name?  Prince.  Prince Michael.  Prince Michael.  He looks kind of cocky for a kid.  Yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't you be?  I am now and I'm a nobody.  Yes.  Guy is worth a hundred million easily now.  Easily.  Little blanket looks like, I do not want to be here.  Right.  He looks like Spanish. 
[00:45:00]  He looks like.  Hey, Speedy.  I don't want to be here.  And you're the expert at cartoons.  Oh, fuck.  I'm around it.  There is a cartoon character.  And we'll get there.  What was it?  Pepe.  Pepe.  Le Pew.  Le Pew.  And then they would dress up the one.  Oh, help me out.  They would.  Somehow a female cat.  Female cat.  They would turn into a skunk.  Or a skunk into a cat.  Somehow get a white stripe on its back. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  And then Pepe would try to rape the cat.  And remember the scared look of the female cat in those cartoons with the big eyes?  When Pepe would have a hold on the cat with the stripe and trying to get away.  That's Blanket.  Yes.  Blanket is that petrified face.  All right.  I knew we'd get there.  I thought they.  They'd create a cartoon about sexual assault and attempted rape.  Oh, absolutely.  That was date rape all the way.  The guy was, you know, he saw that stripe, freaked out, and would try to muscle in. 
[00:46:00]  Everyone's trying to do their own Google bomb.  No.  Kevin from Connecticut nailed it today.  Blanket hates the light.  Stephen S. from Bayshore has his own Google bomb.  No, Stephen S.  You lose.  You lose today.  Blanket hates the light.  Because he does.  That poor bastard.  That poor little child.  Where do you think Blanket is right now?  Little Blanket hiding under the bed.  He's in a closet talking to mushrooms. 
[00:46:30]  He does not want to be Joe Jackson's son.  Oh, my God.  And has Joe Jackson ever commented about beating up Michael and all that?  No.  It's pretty much well documented that Michael was abused.  Michael has said it himself.  He did in a very famous interview with Oprah Winfrey.  Has Joe Jackson ever told his side of the story?  I don't think so.  I haven't heard it.  I know there was one point Michael had left the window and his room opened.  And Joe came in through that open window and scared the shit out of young Michael saying that, 
[00:47:00]  look, you could get kidnapped.  What are you doing leaving the window open?  What the fuck?  But instead of just telling him that, he came through the window as if he was a kidnapper  and scared the bejesus out of young Michael.  He'll be doing that with Blanky.  Little Blanket.  Little Blanket.  Can you find more pictures of Blanket?  I feel so bad for that kid.  He just looks very nervous.  He's very nervous indeed.  Google Blanket hates the light.  Holding a doll. 
[00:47:30]  He's got a little doll in his hand.  Yeah, it's a little Michael Jackson doll.  Google Blanket hates the light.  The other two look like they're going to be all right.  Yeah.  I worry about Blanket.  Blanket, we ought to go to the nervous hospital.  Jimmy, once again, what do you think Blanket is doing right now?  I don't know, but wherever he is, he's probably right now trying to book a ticket to Alaska  for half the year so he can be outdoors and not have to worry about sunlight hitting him.  I'm nervous.  He wants to be where it starts.  What the hell you got to be nervous for?  You got no job.  I'm obsessed with Blanket today. 
[00:48:00]  Little Blanket.  Little Petrified.  Little Petrified Blanket.  He looks like Cousin It, if you ever got to see Cousin It's eyes.  He's so scared.  Yeah.  He's just so scared.  Is that blanket being held off?  Oh, yeah.  So it was a little blanket that was being dangled off the balcony that day?  And that's why he's afraid of the light.  Yeah, yeah.  His first interaction with the light was his whacked out father holding him way above the 
[00:48:30]  ground.  Over a balcony ledge.  What year was that?  That was, well, Blanket was still so young.  How old is Blanket now?  I think Blanket's about six, I would guess.  So maybe six years ago.  Or a little Blanket.  Somewhere around there.  Let's say hi to Oscar in El Paso.  By the way, is that his name or his nickname?  His real name is Prince Michael III, right?  Well, they figure that you just can't go through life calling the kid Blanket.  So they did the smart thing and gave him the same name as his brother.  As the older brother, which is, you know, perfect. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Oscar, what's going on?  What's up, boy?  Hey.  Oscar.  Hey, I just had a quick comment, man.  That Blanket kid kind of reminds me of that kid from Benchwarmers that's afraid of the  sunlight.  They're always battling the sun with his little plastic sword.  God bless you for seeing Benchwarmers.  Yeah.  That's what I say to you today.  All right.  All right.  Hopefully someone got that reference.  It's like little lupus from Loomis or whatever his name is.  Right, right, right.  From the Bad News Bears.  Yeah.  Was his name lupus?  I named him after a disease. 
[00:49:30]  I think you might be right.  Oh, here you go.  Todd in Florida.  This is a good one.  Todd.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Don't forget, Google Blanket hates the light.  Todd, what do you got?  Hey, doesn't Blanket kind of look like that girl in The Grudge?  A little bit.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  A little.  Ah, very scary.  Have a good one, guys.  All right, man.  She was scared of you. 
[00:50:00]  Let's go to Matt in North Carolina.  Matt.  I heard those Japanese horror films, by the way, are fucking horrendously scary.  Yeah, yeah.  They're supposed to be.  You haven't seen any of them, Jim?  Not with like subtitles and stuff.  I want to see.  Do they are.  Ringu, I heard.  It's like the Japanese version of The Ring.  Yeah.  Hold on a second, Matt.  And they're supposed to be very frightening.  There's a big section on Netflix I heard about.  No, they're not supposedly frightening.  They're over the top frightening.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  What do you do with the subtitles?  Terrible.  Frightening.  Yeah.  I don't like things coming down the stairs like that.  What? 
[00:50:30]  Hey, I don't like dead things on the steps.  I don't like them coming down the stairs and their heads turn ways they're not supposed  to turn.  What do you want?  That's very frightening.  I'm not a fan of something.  Oh, God.  Stop it, Danny.  You're fucking freaking me out, man.  I can't look at this shit.  I get petrified like a little pussy fairy Mary with these movies.  Iraq just whispered the spider walk from The Exorcist.  That was so hack.  Even back in the day.  I wasn't scared by that.  I started laughing as a kid.  That's 73.  I was laughing.  Oh, fucking unborn.  Goddamn you with this trailer. 
[00:51:00]  I didn't see this.  What's wrong?  I didn't either.  Can I see it?  No.  All right.  You want to see a trailer?  Matt, North Carolina, what do you got?  I'll pause that then, Dan, please.  I'm in North Carolina, but I'm originally from Rhode Island.  I've been listening to you guys on and off.  WNW.  I could catch you one and once in a while.  More about you.  But you guys destroy the media.  I love it.  You, Colbert, and Stuart just destroy the media.  And it's so great.  Look at us in good company.  I would say we were the first, my friends.  Who, who, who?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yo, they followed your lead. 
[00:51:30]  You guys are taking on the media, and it's one of the best sources of news.  But I was just saying how the media tricks us into not trying new things.  I grew up doing Dungeons and Dragons.  And Gary Gygax invented that whole world, that whole universe.  And then when they came out with Harry Potter, they're like, oh, she's so amazing.  She's so this.  She's so that.  And she invented all.  No.  She just, she just dumbed it down.  It was like Dungeons and Dragons for girls. 
[00:52:00]  But then when I watched.  Is Harry Potter a ripoff of Dungeons and Dragons?  Because I, as a kid, I, I played outside.  So I don't know.  Exactly.  I looked at pornography.  Dumb hobbies.  I couldn't be bothered with the dye.  Put your fucking black jacket wearing nerds.  Wizards, the dwarves, all that stuff was already invented before she ever wrote those books.  She just dumbed it down for everybody.  And then they made it like, oh, she was such an incredible author.  But I didn't give her a chance.  But then when I watched the movies, I said, you know what?  These are pretty cool. 
[00:52:30]  These are pretty damn cool.  You know?  And it's like.  The movies are well.  Well, I tricked you into not watching stuff.  Oh, we're called the Matt Radio Show.  Thank you, Matt.  Now, the movies are very well done.  I watch them.  Scary trailer.  Yeah.  I need help again.  You don't go to the movies, so I need help from someone out there.  I watched a lot of trailers, though.  It's the, it's the preview.  It's, it's, they're showing it in every theater.  Sorry, I can't even focus. 
[00:53:00]  Uh, I'll be right, though.  Not that you can.  You know who's in it?  Uh, it's, they adopt a little girl.  The orphan.  Holy, you've seen the trailer, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I have not seen it.  Does that one scare you?  No, she's a little creepy.  That, that, that trailer's not scaring you?  No, you know why?  Because it doesn't look like an occult kind of a thing or a scary, like, thing.  It looks like a fucked up chick that is fucking with a family really badly.  Like, you know, like the, the bad son or one of those kind of movies.  Yeah.  But she's a little creepy looking. 
[00:53:30]  I'm surprised that doesn't scare you.  Wednesday Addams-ish looking.  Can we see the trailer?  I haven't seen it.  I saw a movie poster last night, and my, uh, my girlfriend was kind of railing against it.  You want to see this trailer?  Yeah, I do, I do, actually, because we just, she was blessed it.  Well, that poster comes right out at you, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Dude, she is creepy.  Like, she's going to move.  She is kind of creepy.  Really?  This doesn't bother you?  No.  I hear it, but I don't see it.  No.  No, this is, uh.  Scared.  See, because it's not like that weirdness and, and, and, uh, supernaturally shit.  You need supernaturally. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, supernaturally shit.  Scared the shit out of me.  Her, she just, I'm sure it looks like kind of a creepy movie, but she's doing things like,  you know, trying to kill the little brother and fucking with the mother and shit like that.  But, um.  Taking off in the family car.  Yeah, yeah, things like that.  Running over babies.  And she just generally looks kind of creepy.  Yeah.  But she looks like an orphan.  She looks like a character from a video game I played.  I can't remember the name of the game, but, uh, she looks like a video game character.  Where's this sound coming from?  From over there.  Oh, it's.  Oh, E-Roc. 
[00:54:30]  From over there.  Frightening.  Multiple prescriptions and fake names.  Bodyguard, uh, details Jackson's pill addiction.  I've seen that.  Oh, oh.  I can't wait for that.  Quarters report.  Can't find, uh, the trailer for that?  That's all right.  Should be on, um, Apple.  Yeah, that's all right.  Apple.  Uh, more people want to comment about Blanket.  Let's not forget.  Blanket hates the light.  Blanket.  Oh, there it is.  Uh, you got it?  Okay.  Yeah.  Pop that up.  The orphan.  Or just orphan.  And I might have to apologize. 
[00:55:00]  The Spider-Walk and Exorcist was not in the actual movie?  No, no, no.  That was in the remake.  It was cut out of the movie.  Oh, okay.  They felt it was a double climax in the scene.  Um, but then we all saw it, though.  How did I see it?  They showed it to you years and years later.  They put out a, yeah.  Yeah, they put out like a director's cut.  Okay.  That's where they are.  I apologize.  It wasn't scary in hindsight.  Like, if you saw it as an adult, you'd go, oh, okay.  I would have sworn I saw it in the actual movie.  In 73, if you saw that, it would have been horrifying.  I would have.  You'd just shake your pants.  I know.  You'd just shake your pants.  Dude, people were, literally when The Exorcist was premiered, people were leaving the theater 
[00:55:30]  vomiting.  It was, it was that upsetting for people.  Yeah.  Was that the first real scary movie as far as the mainstream goes?  I don't know.  I'm sure.  No, no, no.  Vincent Price did old movies.  The Pit and the Pendulum.  There was a lot of horrifying movies.  Psycho.  Were you scared by Vincent Price movies?  You know what?  There was one, two Vincent Price movies that scared the shit out of me.  One was, um.  Hitchcock.  The, the one where, uh, uh, they had to stay in the castle overnight. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Um, they remade it later on, uh, House on Haunted Hill.  And there was a scene where a woman, a ghostly woman is going through the hallway and she wasn't  walking.  She was just kind of floating in midair.  Oh, right on.  Dude, scared the living shit out of me.  Okay.  And then there was the other one, which was kind of like the Omega Man.  It was, uh, the last man on earth, I believe it was called.  It was like, I am legend, things like that.  A plague kind of kills everybody and you got to burn the bodies and shit. 
[00:56:30]  And, uh, he didn't want to burn his wife's body after she died.  So he buried her up back.  And then he goes through a bunch of shenanigans.  Things happen.  Uh, and then there's a knock on the door and you hear, let, let me in, let me in.  And he opens the door and there's his wife that he buried, kind of fucked up.  And, uh, I think she, you know, kills him or something or that sounds creepy, but it  was so scary.  And then we used to call her the lady that strikes at night when we were kids, we would 
[00:57:00]  call her the lady that strikes at night and say, if you don't watch out, the lady that  strikes at night, we'll get you great.  We ran out of the room, um, screaming when that came on black Sabbath, the movie that  they actually got the name from with a Boris Carla film.  That was fucking frightening.  Boris Carla.  Couldn't smell my shit.  Fuck Boris Carla.  But no, the exorcist was one that just, it fucking talked about, you know, we know what  it was about, but I don't think other films had done that.  Right.  And the, the video game was, video game was fear. 
[00:57:30]  Oh yeah.  Very good.  Well, no, I didn't get that one.  Daryl, the PA gets credit for that.  Yep.  So, all right.  Uh.  I want to see the orphan trailer.  You know?  Yeah, I have not seen anything about it except the poster last night and, and, and my girlfriend  just started blasting at how stupid it looked.  You know, the next thing that Sirius XM has to work on is a visual element for our radio  show because how, how great would this be to play this trailer?  Jimmy's looking at it for the first time and then the people out there could be looking  at the thing we're looking at.  Link it. 
[00:58:00]  Huh?  Eh, go to apple.com.  Apparently Apple's website has a bunch of trailers up there.  Slash trailer, right?  Or trailers.  Slash trailers.  All right, hit play for you.  If I get frightened and leave, I'll come back.  Don't get frightened, Jimmy.  I will go with Jimmy just gets annoyed.  I might.  It looks stupid to me.  The title I don't even like.  We're seeing kids for the first time this weekend.  I'm ready to adopt.  Creepy old house.  Winter.  I'm having an older child is not an easy decision. 
[00:58:30]  Older child.  Why aren't you down at the party?  I've never really seen the point of it.  I guess I'm different.  There's nothing wrong with being different, you know?  Yeah.  This is an extraordinary little girl.  She's very mature for her age.  You seem to have made quite a connection.  Why wouldn't a black nun give him a little more info?  Is this their house?  Yeah.  It's your home, too.  You're just as much part of this family as Danny and Max.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  This is our new student.  So I'd like you all to get her to be very welcome today.  Oh, look.  Little Bo Peep text me.  She wants her outfit back. 
[00:59:00]  Oh.  Oh, shit.  All right, so it ain't our fault.  Esther?  What are you doing?  Change her name.  Something's happening to cause Esther to feel this way.  Huh.  I think there's something wrong with Esther.  You think?  We need to know what we're dealing with.  The swing set.  The trouble is that way of finding her.  Oh, she looks creepy.  What kind of trouble? 
[00:59:30]  Nothing has happened so far.  Fucking Esther kicked the inside of a urinal.  I knew it.  You'll never guess her secret.  Yeah.  She did a shitty movie.  I'm going from the Sarn Institute.  I knew Jimmy would be annoyed.  How can we have no record of her being there?  See, she might be a ghost, Jimmy.  Your friend has never heard of her.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  She appeared behind with the lightning lit of the room up, and she was there.  Yeah.  Now she's in the car with their biological shit.  Oh, mom, the S is driving. 
[01:00:00]  See, she put the car in neutral.  I don't think mommy likes me very much.  This movie looks fucking annoying.  It's like the omen with a vagina.  Stupid.  She killed her family.  Oh.  Oh.  Surprise for mommy.  It's a bad script.  What's happening? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, so what?  Yuck.  Esther?  Uh-oh.  Esther.  Oh, she woke up quickly.  Yeah, and then she pops out and scares the father.  It's probably a moment early in the movie where she goes, gotcha, daddy.  And he goes, oh, oh, oh.  Nothing really scary.  You're right.  That movie looks like shit.  That's supposed to be a chilling ending.  It's not.  No.  That's the story of, that's the glory of love.  That was like Nightmare on Elm Street ripoff, which was scary in Nightmare on Elm Street. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  But when the, you know, one, two, that was fucking scary.  Yeah.  This was not.  We should.  I actually want to download her version of my tunes.  We should redo the trailer with some Peter Gabriel song and make it into a comedy.  A happy comedy.  Those are really well done.  When people do them good.  Bravo.  When they do them good, it's well done.  It's good.  It's the orphan.  People are wondering what we just saw.  Actually, just orphan.  Just orphan?  Okay.  It's like, you know, scorpions. 
[01:01:30]  People say the scorpions.  Heading toward our first break.  It's just scorpions.  Google blanket hates the light as we take a phone call from Clutch in Baltimore.  Clutch.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, he looks exactly like the kid from Lost Boys.  The little kid that was in Lost Boys.  Hmm.  Remember that?  And it's weird that Corey Feldman was in that movie, too.  Oh.  You know, he's hurting.  Yeah.  Don't forget, Corey Feldman is hurting.  Be nice to him.  The rest of the world is getting over this, but not Corey Feldman.  Andrew, New Jersey. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, boys.  I know what's wrong with Esther.  Yeah.  She went out with Anthony.  Oh, now.  Oh, shit.  She's much too young.  Too old.  Let's say hi to Mary in Glendale.  Mary?  Mary.  Yeah, hi.  I think Blanket's biological father is that guy, Mikos Brando,  but it's always on, Larry King.  Holy shit.  You might be onto something. 
[01:02:30]  What the hell are you doing?  Is that liquid shit going into your toilet?  What are you doing?  You're masturbating.  What was that noise there, Mary?  Oh, no.  I had the faucet running.  Oh, the faucet was running.  The faucet.  Okay.  What, do you live in a trailer?  No.  No, I don't.  Oh, I heard a pump.  It sounded like a pump.  Are you on a boat?  In the kitchen.  No.  All right, cool.  Water on a boat never seems to work.  You've got to pump out your shit and your urine.  Jesus.  Yeah, boning's fun. 
[01:03:00]  Mary, thank you.  I kind of like that theory, actually.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Quick call from Mary.  You want to take a break?  I'm scared now from that orphan trailer.  Well, we'll just keep the lights on.  I knew Jimmy wouldn't like that.  It was awful.  Something's wrong with Esther.  Her name?  Her name's awful.  What is that?  What is this?  It's your favorite.  From, uh...  Oh, no.  The Unborn. 
[01:03:30]  The Unborn.  Go back.  Go back.  Let me hear this trailer, too.  I want to get frightened.  Oh, fuck.  It's walking on.  It's doing the crab walk.  Can I see the beginning, Dan?  There's a black man punching someone.  Oh, no.  It's Isaac Hayes.  The Duke of New York punching the Unborn.  The baby was down when I got here, and the four-year-old conked out as soon as I read to him.  Oh, shit.  Case?  Hang on.  Some people are doorways.  What are you doing, Matty?  You have to come here.  Holy shit.  He wants to be born now. 
[01:04:00]  It's the same trailer.  Case?  It's winter.  It's scary.  What are you doing with your eye?  What are you talking about?  One iris is a different color than the other, which happens occasionally when you're dealing  with twins.  I'm an only child.  Ooh.  Oh, boy.  It's a big reveal.  She's not a twin.  Am I a twin, Dad?  He died while the two of you were still in your room.  Thanks for ruining the whole movie, by the way.  Yeah, no kidding.  These previews stopped. 
[01:04:30]  So the little kid is her twin?  I live in you.  You denied entry into our world.  We don't need to see this movie now.  Ah!  He's a cute little boy.  I don't like this.  This is frightening me.  They're just showing, uh...  Oh, shit.  She's laying there.  She's screaming, but you can't see it.  It's like...  Ah!  Fuck!  The blankets are revealed.  The blankets are pulled down, and the little kid is...  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:00]  The kid's gotta go.  Why does the kid keep popping up uncomfortably?  He's scary!  Get out of here!  Go!  Oh, what the fuck was that?  The boy is showing up all over.  Oh, my God!  Get the fuck out of here!  Come on.  That's scary!  Really?  There's nothing scary here.  No, that thing was...  I just want this to be over.  They're trying to do something.  What's going on?  I don't know.  No, look!  Ah! 
[01:05:30]  The boy is showing up.  Oh, no!  He wants to be born now.  Oh, my God.  I'm not with this fucking kid.  No, this is scary.  It's like...  Look, the thing is...  It's chasing her around the house.  With a knife.  Are you doing Rosemary's Baby or something?  It has kind of that feel to it, no?  Look, that is fucking scary.  That looks scarier than the other one.  That is scary as shit!  The orphan looks horrible. 
[01:06:00]  Don't ask...  Don't look!  Oh, no.  There's one where she was walking into a room.  Is that Megan Fox?  No.  That is it?  No, I don't think so.  Holy shit.  Really?  She was pretty hot.  And she was walking into a room and there was a figure of a girl sleeping in a chair and  she wanted to touch her.  That's obviously a dream segment.  Dude, I don't like that.  Is that out now?  When that old guy is fucking crawling and then his head spins around, get the fuck out  of here!  Oh, why don't you stop being such a queer... 
[01:06:30]  I don't like that.  Why?  All right.  You're yelling.  I know.  I couldn't help it.  That really bothers you?  I was like a black person in the movie theater.  You really were.  Don't go in there!  Oh, shit!  Oh, no!  Oh.  What do you think, Danny?  Scary?  Well, it's a part...  Danny likes scary movies.  I mean, you know, the parts that they put in the trailer are creepy.  Yeah!  You know, but...  I think Orphan is scarier.  I don't think it's gonna...  No way!  The Orphan's not scary? 
[01:07:00]  The Orphan's just silly.  The trailer was scary.  You're gonna find out that she killed her whole family and was put in a nervous hospital.  Yeah, some dumb shit.  Some rip-off of...  What was the other one where they killed the whole...  The kid...  The ring.  Yeah, yeah.  Is there anything on Ringu?  Has anybody seen that?  The Japanese version of it?  The trailer for Ringu, but I fell asleep.  Why'd you fall asleep?  Again, that's no indicator, though, the way you fucking pour him down.  I put stuff...  I put stuff...  I put stuff...  The difference between falling asleep and passing out.  Yeah, you can...  You can watch fucking games...  Game 7 of the fucking World Series.  I dozed off in the 8th inning. 
[01:07:30]  There was a 2-2 tie.  It was tied up with bases loaded.  That's fucking unbelievable.  I have a bad habit of putting stuff on, like, to try to...  You know, like, as I'm going to sleep.  Yeah.  So, is there anything on there with the ring?  Is Ringu the original...  Is that what it's called?  I actually have it.  I'll bring it in.  I want to see something from an ear.  That's what gets on my cock ring.  Ringu.  That's Greg Karnak.  Ringu.  Ngu.  Ringu.  Ringu.  Ringu.  Oh.  What gets on my cock ring?  Ngu.  Ringu. 
[01:08:00]  Ringu.  He was the awful drummer for the beddles.  That's what I'll do when I want to talk to you.  I'll Ringu.  Phone jokes.  I'll do it.  Should be decapitated.  Oh, shit.  Is this Ringu?  Yeah.  Ringu rules.  All right, dude.  This looks a little scary.  We apologize for watching Bryce's silent trailers on the radio.  Hey, fuck you.  Sorry, guys. 
[01:08:30]  Look at him yourself.  This looks really fucking scary.  Yeah, I heard this was scarier than The Ring.  It's the same thing, the creepy girl with the black hair.  Yeah, yeah, the weird.  Oh, man.  I don't like this.  One of the best horror movies in years.  Just don't watch it alone.  All right.  I watched The Ring alone.  I was so fucking scared I had to turn the lights on.  It's scary.  See, they know how to use light way better. 
[01:09:00]  In that trailer.  Yeah.  That was way scarier.  I want to make a horror movie where everybody's in a perfectly lit room.  And the ghost just kind of goes, ghost here.  That wouldn't be scary, Jim.  It would.  You open the door, it's somebody in a white hood, and he's like, boo.  Oh, awful movie maker, Jim.  That'd be great.  One that was really terrible.  I thought it was going to be cool because the trailer looked really good.  It was called White Noise.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was terrible.  With Michael Keaton.  Michael Keaton.  Oh, yeah.  His big comeback movie. 
[01:09:30]  Was that really bad?  Oh, it was terrible.  I didn't even get through it.  Why'd you think it was going to be good?  Just because it looked like the trailers that make these movies look so creepy.  Like, oh, shit.  I got to see that.  And then you go, and you're just like, god damn, this movie sucks my dick.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Ringo.  The girl answers the phone and says, hero?  Nice.  Hydro, North Carolina.  Hydro.  What's going on, boy?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, Anthony.  You need to man up, man.  Quit being a pussy.  You drive an 800 horsepower Mustang at speeds on the brink of death. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, but there's no scary, monstery things in my car.  But what if a scary little monstery girl pops out of nowhere while you're driving that Shelby?  I can go home with a pink ribbon on my fucking grill.  That's what I'm doing.  Sticky Boogers.  What's up?  Sticky Boogers?  I love how we say these guys' names very seriously.  Sticky Boogers?  Sticky Boogers.  These Sticky Boogers.  Yes, sir.  Huntington, boy.  Oh, what's happened?  Hey, did you, really quick, don't want to waste too much time. 
[01:10:30]  Did you stop by FH Riley's?  I hear the remodel's done.  I moved out to Indiana.  I grew up in Indiana.  Okay, never mind.  Steven S. from Bayshore was tweeting pictures last night, and the place looks awesome.  I got to get out there and check it out.  I'm going back there for my birthday in August.  I'm definitely going to go down there.  Well, we appreciate your business.  What do you got for the show today, Sticky?  I just wanted to tell Anthony what the last caller just said.  Make sure you douche before you get back in that Shelby, Ant. 
[01:11:00]  Do you, what?  Because I'm an honest guy that is saying that I get scared from these horror movies.  What do you think?  No one gets scared from these things.  They just put them out, and no one gets scared from them at all.  No.  People get scared.  You were a little more scared.  I get, he's basically saying you need to wash your pussy.  I have to wash my pussy?  I don't think I have to.  That's what he said.  I don't have to wash my vagina.  Do not get in the car with him, Jimmy.  He's probably going to tear himself to death. 
[01:11:30]  I know.  This is another Michael Jackson tribute.  A bunch of kids dancing.  I love you guys.  All right.  Hey, thank you, Sticky.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  And it all comes back to, by the way, the two girls in The Shining, which I believe is one of the scariest scenes ever in a movie.  When you first see those twins, and they pop into the hallway as Little Danny, not our Little Danny, but Little Danny is riding his big wheel down the hallway. 
[01:12:00]  Going around the corner.  And then the girls are standing there.  Old fucking Grady's kids.  Dude, this music creeps me out.  Look, look, look.  God damn, they're petrifying looking.  The Kubrick invention, those girls.  Dude.  They were not in the book.  No.  That is fucking.  Come play with us, Danny.  No.  Why not?  He's going to be lonely at the hotel.  Danny didn't want to play with them. 
[01:12:30]  Why not play with a couple of kids who took some axings?  That's what happens when you play with matches.  You get chopped up by a bald-headed servant.  Well, the father, they stole the pack of matches and tried to burn it down.  That's how he corrects his children.  Instead of just saying, don't play with matches, it's dangerous, he fucking axes them both in the hallway.  What a bloody ax scene that was.  That really is a lot of blood.  He was knocking.  That is a great scene.  How scary is this music?  It's very scary.  It's great music, though.  And this is the music that starts the film.  The opening music. 
[01:13:00]  When they're driving up the mountain and it's a bright, sunny day and this music's playing and you're creeped out already.  You know what else was very creepy about that movie?  When there was like a scene and it would build and build and build and they'd go, boom, Tuesday.  Yeah.  And it would just like show, you know, the next day.  They're like, wah!  That movie holds up big time.  Those girls are frightening.  They're not real twins, by the way.  The Shinies scared everyone.  Oh, really?  In real life.  I didn't know that.  I want to fuck them as adults.  Yeah, I want to know.  They should do a Where Are They Now segment. 
[01:13:30]  They just walk around hand in hand in those stupid dresses all the time trying to get recognized.  Trying to get scared and they don't scare anyone?  No.  They're just old cougars now.  When they need help, come and wait on us.  All right, we got it.  We know who you are.  You are.  We're not scared.  You're not scary.  Bring us coffee, Danny.  We're not Danny here.  You're not French anyone.  You're 43.  Get a hold of yourself.  We got to go to Kyle in Kansas City.  He's a third degree black belt.  Kyle.  Hey, Kyle.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy. 
[01:14:00]  I got a side with Anthony.  I can't watch them scary movies.  My kids watch them.  I go in another room.  I can watch war movies, but that's scary stuff.  I don't need it.  You know who else can't watch them?  Fucking Club Soda Kenny.  Cannot watch scary movies.  No?  He's a big girl.  For real?  Yes.  Ask him when he comes back.  Fucking flat foot.  Hey, love your show, guys.  Thanks.  All right, Kyle.  Scary goddamn movies.  I like, you know what movies don't bother me?  Like zombie movies.  Those are fine.  I love watching them. 
[01:14:30]  Things like that.  Not bad.  It's those weird, twisted people doing things with their bodies freaks me out.  Like that twisting around.  Or when the girl from The Ring comes out of the well.  And the video quality is all shaky and black and white.  And that woman in the painting.  Well, they make a mistake making it look too slick.  Making it look like a Hollywood movie.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  There's a fine line where you want it to look more real. 
[01:15:00]  Even the original Evil Dead had some moments in it that were genuinely fucking scary.  Like when that girl is sitting there just laughing, sitting on the floor going,  With her head going back and forth.  Fuck you.  That's scary.  Then the other ones were just funny.  Ash.  Ashley.  Why don't we take a break?  All righty.  I need your opinion on the Obama picture.  Do not say a thing until we get back about the Obama picture.  No.  No.  I'm hoping we can get along today. 
[01:15:30]  There's one I like and there's one that disgusts me.  Really?  Yes.  Look at that tease by little Jimmy Norton.  Wow.  But first, the FU line.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What happened?  That was Hayden Panetari?  No.  What was?  What did you do?  Was that Hayden Panetari?  Hold on.  Play that again.  I thought it was just some dopey listener.  You're kidding me?  She knows who I am? 
[01:16:00]  Fuck that.  She wants an invite to my house.  Fuck you.  She mentioned me too.  Fuck that.  We're fighting over Hayden Panetari.  What's going on, Derek?  Derek's calling E-Rock in in a panic.  Why?  You've always said mean things about her.  What's this?  What is this?  Nothing.  We're listening to the Black Crows.  Shut up.  Chris Robinson's about to sing right here.  Fuck him.  But what about Hayden Panetari?  Oh.  Hayden.  Now I think she's hot.  Shut up. 
[01:16:30]  Any girl that mentions me by name I think is hot.  No.  Especially if you're a young starlet in Hollywood.  When we were coming back.  When we were coming back from break.  Let me hear that again.  I didn't hear it.  Hey, I'm Hayden Panetari from Heroes.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  And just like Opie, I'm still waiting on my invitation to Anthony's house.  You're invited.  Oh my God.  Hayden, you're invited.  Who else has a hard-on?  What happened?  Jesus H. Christ.  I think he's got a hard-on.  She's got an open invite.  Holy shit. 
[01:17:00]  Come on.  Who fed her that to say?  Sam or E-Rock?  No, she just said it.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Shut up.  I'm looking at fucking Neck McGillicuddy.  Neck McGillicuddy.  God damn, that's pretty cool.  Who got that done for us?  Who gets the props today?  You did, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Jimmy.  Bullshit.  I know who got it done for us.  Who?  The brown noser.  Was it E-Rock?  Instead of being nice to him.  Yeah, the brown noser got it done. 
[01:17:30]  Get E-Rock in here.  E-Rock, you get that done for us?  I want to know the circumstance and everything behind that.  Who gives a shit about the rest of the show?  You got that done.  What happened?  Where were you?  I have no doubt in my mind.  Did you see her?  Do you have a picture?  Did you do that?  Where did you see that?  Was it over?  Did you finger popper?  Tell us everything.  Was it in here?  Was it somewhere?  What was it?  Where did you see that chubby bitch?  Go.  She was here on Tuesday around 1.30 doing an interview for the Hits 1 channel.  Why didn't you tell anyone who you didn't know?  I knew Monday. 
[01:18:00]  We kept trying to see if we can get her in for the morning, but we couldn't.  Does she know who we are?  Yeah, she knew who we are.  Shut up.  Why?  You don't have to lie.  I'm not.  You just gave her this and said, read this fucking thing.  Whether it's true or not, I said, do you know who the show is?  She said yes.  And then the Hits 1 people were kind enough to get the liners for us.  If she knows the show, have her call and just say hi.  That's all I want.  We won't say shit except, hi, is this Hayden? 
[01:18:30]  Do you know the show?  I want to ask about that vag bulge in those pictures.  It's fucking hot.  When was this?  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Why wasn't I told she would be here in the building?  Yeah, I said it's true.  Why didn't you tell her?  I don't know.  We didn't think you'd hang around until 1.30.  For Hayden Panetta?  Are you insane?  Of course I would have.  Of course.  Get a picture?  That would go right up on classmates.  Oh, it's my girlfriend.  That's what I do all the time now.  I just take pictures, and then I take pictures with pretty celebrities, and I put it up here and say, here's me and my girlfriend. 
[01:19:00]  Bud the Trucker, this is a very good phone call.  A question for Anthony.  Yes, Bud.  And I just wanted to know, that opening night, should she just walk up and ring the doorbell?  She could fucking ring that doorbell.  She could get a, I'll give her a key.  She could walk in the house and do whatever the hell she pleases.  Yes, she has an open invitation.  Well, but it's not really serious, right?  Like, you know, when Kevin Smith invites you over, he really doesn't mean it. 
[01:19:30]  But no, no, shut up!  Oh, you really don't mean it.  Yeah, you're right, Bud.  You don't really mean it, Ant.  That's too bad.  Who is she?  Does she have a fucking boyfriend or something?  Who is she going out with?  What's the scuttlebutt?  What's the scuttlebutt on her?  Yeah, E-Rock knows.  E-Rock, come on, gossip.  What is she doing?  Who is she going out with?  E-Rock's a gossip girl.  Was there a dude with her here? 
[01:20:00]  No, she's single.  She used to date one of the guys from Heroes.  Jamie Hector?  Is it Neon Heroes, a black guy from The Wire?  She was dating someone from Heroes.  I lost it in a while.  E-Rock eats Heroes.  I think it was John Huber?  No, that's your made-up name.  John Huber?  That was my made-up name.  That's the one he uses all the time.  I use Pete Polina because he was my old high school dean.  When do you use that?  That's when you got, it's like, you know, 
[01:20:30]  it's like Vandalay Industries, things like that.  Or you go to the hospital and you don't have health insurance  and they're asking for your name.  There's always reasons to use it.  Because it was always John Huber, Greg Hughes in Harborfield High School.  We have such a hard time meeting Hayden with that bi-coastal relationship.  It's going to be rough.  She's out in fucking L.A.  I'm here in New York.  How do we deal with that?  She fucks other people and you watch her show.  So that's probably how that relationship should go. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I think that's pretty much how we do it.  You sit in military garb and tug your prick watching her DVDs  and she thinks of everything but you.  All right, you put it in perspective, James.  Thank you.  Anthony, would you eat her ass?  What?  Yeah.  Is that even a question?  While she was oxtailing.  Do I breathe?  There was a part two to my question.  Thank you, Jimmy.  While she's turtling.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:21:30]  Well, fucking Anthony, are you going to breathe today?  You might as well ask that.  All right.  Anthony, you're having a beer when you get home.  Might as well ask that.  Jesse, Oklahoma.  Jesse.  Hi, what's up?  I was downloading that Sirius app on my phone  and I noticed you guys aren't on the survey crap  that they make you fill out to get to the damn app.  So what the fuck?  God.  What, they have a survey thing?  Yeah, you got to fill out that survey  and fucking assholes on there,  but you guys aren't on there.  Wait, so there's...  Ask you what you listen to and... 
[01:22:00]  Do they say, is the virus one of the choices?  No.  Just comedy and talk and fucking stern.  Oh, remember that?  We talked about that.  They just kind of put it all in categories.  Yeah, that's too bad.  Fucking assholes.  That's supposed to be marketing.  How the fuck are they going to know  who's listening to you guys  so they don't put you on there?  Yeah, it makes it hard.  Wow, it makes it hard.  You're right.  Come on.  A million people downloaded that app,  which is a great app.  It's Pet the Dog Day.  No, you're not shit on the dog.  The guy just called up and said, 
[01:22:30]  look, the dog was barking.  So we have to say, yes,  the dog does bark sometimes.  It's not always good.  Yes.  But Pet the Dog.  Good boy.  You know what?  Good boy.  I got to interrupt this.  We got a big star on the line.  Big star.  Calling from the other side of the world.  Chris Jericho.  Chris.  Oh, my God.  Literally calling from the other side of the world  from Manila in the Philippines.  The Thriller in Manila.  That's a long way.  What time is it there, Chris?  You know what's really cool  is that there's actually a poster  on the wall of this arena  of the Thriller in Manila,  one of the original posters.  Grab that?  Grab that thing. 
[01:23:00]  Very cool.  Dude, why don't you grab that?  The best thing is, but check it out.  It's got a poster of the Thriller in Manila.  It's got a poster of the last Manny Pacquiao fight,  and it's got a poster of Bananarama.  All those three in a row.  So there we go.  Nice.  Yeah, that's the truth.  So I'm your Venus, I'm your Fire.  It's right up there with Ali and Fraser.  Great, yeah.  Fantastic.  There's only one question I want to ask you about Manila.  How fucking hot and humid is that damn place?  It is fucking brutal, man.  Really?  Is it as bad as they say?  You ever see, like, you know, 
[01:23:30]  like a good morning Vietnam or like a full metal jacket  where, like, in the streets of the city,  it's all just like rickshaws and palm trees and, like, rain,  and that's exactly what it looks like here.  I feel like I'm in a Vietnam movie.  Really?  What time is it there?  It's exactly, just switch a.m. to p.m.  So whatever it is, it's like 7.45, so 7.45 p.m.  And you've got to wrestle like it?  The show is actually going on right now as we speak.  You're wrestling today?  I am wrestling today.  That's right, yep.  Is this going to be on TV or? 
[01:24:00]  No, it's just like an international tour.  We did Hawaii, then we did a couple shows in Japan,  then we came over to Manila.  You're going to wing on over to London and jam with the stones.  Jam with the stones, blow my reward money on the Van Halen  playing my birthday party.  How great is that?  Of course he knows.  Of course he knows.  When I went to Hawaii, I Twittered everyone,  Aloha, Mr. Hand.  Nice.  Coolest place on earth, according to Chris Jericho, where? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, Philippines, if you're in hell.  But you've been to some other great countries, right?  Well, yeah, see, this is the thing, though, man.  You go to some of these countries, like Japan is great,  and, you know, England and Ireland, Scotland, Wales,  they're all cool.  But you come to these places like Philippines and Malaysia  and Singapore, it always seems like it's just one step away  from just complete anarchy, like the entire social structure  is just going to collapse all at once.  Yeah.  Like, we got to the airport yesterday, and we came through, 
[01:25:00]  and they stuck us, like, in this holding room for about an hour,  didn't tell us why, took all of our passports,  just kind of left us in there.  Holy shit.  Yeah, like, why, right?  It's just very creepy.  Yeah, what the hell is that about?  Holding you hostage.  Like, you know, a jungle prison eating maggots like Christian Bale  in Rescue Dawn, you know?  Yeah.  Put you in that fucking cage.  A rat!  All right, there's rats in here, Michael!  That's it, man.  That's exactly right.  That sounds pretty creepy. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, so, wow, how long are you there for?  Just for the day.  We got in last night at, like, midnight.  We do the gig tonight and leave tomorrow morning.  So it's one of those ones that's nice to just get in and get out of.  It's a nice day trip.  Yeah, what are you, a mercenary?  Do they give you a, what kind of flying do they give you?  You got to get in, rescue them, and get out.  What's that?  You're on a private plane, or you got to?  No, we take a, we used to have a private plane that would take us over here for these  international tours, but then there's a couple times when the guys had too many spirits,  shall we say, and got in fights by the exit door at 20,000 feet. 
[01:26:00]  So they kind of decided that maybe it's better to just stick us on the milk run with all  the others.  Oh, that sucks.  They ruined it for you?  Well, that's the thing on wrestling.  See, give wrestlers an inch and they'll hang themselves, you know, with a mile or whatever  you say.  Like, we can't do anything without fucking it up.  Apparently not.  Biggest group of gypsies and miscreants you've ever seen.  It's worse than stand-up comics.  Jesus, that sucks.  Ooh.  A little dig at our old James Norton. 
[01:26:30]  He's accurate, though.  It's starting already.  It's starting already.  Ah, rumors.  Oh, let's Twitter.  Look, you can't argue that point.  Comics really are a piece of shit.  I love the fact that we turned that whole Chris Jericho, Jim Norton thing around, and  now everyone is just buddy-buddy.  Oh.  That was like appearing on shows together and Twittering each other.  We're like best buds now.  Well, that's what I was getting at, to the point where you guys are both going to be on  Z-Rock, what, this week?  Sunday night at 11 o'clock.  Sunday night at 11 o'clock on IFC.  What's Z-Rock?  I still don't understand what this show's about.  It's, uh, they're a band, and it's kind of like a scripted-slash-unscripted show, I 
[01:27:00]  mean, where they get guest stars every week, uh, comedians or different actors, and this  week it was, uh, it was Chris and myself, and, well, Chris, and I was on it, but he was  the real star of it.  And, um, it's like they're a band playing at a kid's birthday party, and Jericho is there,  and, um, I'm a comedian who Lynn Koplitz wants to sign, and I'm a Jericho fan, so that's  how she gets me to kind of go with her.  And I go to the party, and, uh, you know, I meet Jericho, and it's very unpleasant for  him.  Wreckiness ensues.  Yeah, it's wackiness.  The basic premise of the show is, like, there's this, this is a, it's like a Curb Your Enthusiasm, 
[01:27:30]  Curb Your Enthusiasm, Great Voice for Radio, type of a gig, where it's like a real-life  thing that's kind of got this exaggerated plot line to it, where this band is, they're a  real band called Z-O-2, and they've opened for KISS, and they're a really good band, but  they also, to pay the bills, are a kid's band called the Z-Brothers, so they play  kids' birthday parties.  So this is kind of like a scripted reality show type thing, where they, you know, have  their wackiness and their adventures of this band that's trying to make it, that has to  play kids' birthday parties during the day. 
[01:28:00]  So that's the premise of the show.  It's a really cool show.  It's like a, kind of a Flight of the Conchords, uh, Spinal Tap.  Sounds like Miley Cyrus.  It's a little bit of a Miley Cyrus type show.  Where she's just a schoolgirl, and then she puts on a wig, and she becomes a band.  Yeah, exactly.  There you go.  So Jimmy and I are putting on wigs in this show.  Actually, Jimmy becomes a wrestler at the end of this show, which is great.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's why I had that awful outfit on, where I had to ride, he and Chris introduces  me as Jim the Animal Norton, and I have to go like, rawr, and I run through a, uh, holy 
[01:28:30]  shit, do I have to see this?  Dude, I fucking, I run through a thing that says Jim the Animal Norton, and I'm just, I'm  wearing like a fishnet top, with my, yeah, it's fucking really, I gotta see this, tiger  skin, banana hammock.  Yeah, it's really, I look like an asshole.  Hey, Chris, have you seen the episode?  Yes, I have, and I thought, I thought it was really funny.  It's funny too, because you know how it is, you film your parts, and don't really know  like, how it fits in with everybody else's stuff, but it turned out really, really good.  And then the funny thing was, like, they asked me to do the show, and kind of, we kind of 
[01:29:00]  put together a loose plot line of what I would do, and so then when I signed on to do the  show and got the script, lo and behold, I found out that Jim Norton is in the show as  well, and this, we hadn't actually even talked since the big incident, shall we say.  Yes.  So I was kind of laughing, because I was like, Jim Norton and Jericho, like how, what are  the chances of that, you know, just shows like the kismet of the universe.  But it worked out good, I thought the, I actually saw the episode too, and I thought it  was really funny, and it was... 
[01:29:30]  Really funny, man.  And it's funny too, like when you're freaking out on that Thai waiter in the restaurant,  he brings you like a little stack of leaves on a plate, you go, this isn't food, you  probably live under this.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah, it was...  Exactly, that's exactly what I'm feeling right now, I even thought about that.  Like in Manila, people live underneath the little bit of food that you got in Z-Rock, that's  where they live.  Yeah, I scream at this guy, this waiter with Lynn Cobblitz, and I walk, it was really fun, it's  a great vibe to shoot, and the guy directed, is Julie Louise, who drives his husband,  and Brad Hall, who is really good, and I can't wait to see this. 
[01:30:00]  Z-Rock Sunday at 11 o'clock on IFC.  Chris, I gotta ask you the wrestling question that everyone's wondering.  Now, Edge is your tag team partner, he's got a legit injury, he's gonna be out up to maybe  a year.  What the fuck's gonna happen?  Well, that's kind of, yeah, it's kind of one of those things that, you know, people  who say, oh wrestling, that's all fake, that's all bullshit.  Well, I mean, it's definitely show business, but there is the element of realism, and the fact  he was doing, we had a show in San Diego, and he just basically ran across the ring, 
[01:30:30]  and his Achilles tendon tore right off the heel.  Oh, God, you guys get some nasty injuries.  Holy shit.  That's the worst injury you can get, like the Achilles, you know, the Achilles heel,  whatever, if you heard the proverbial Achilles heel.  Yeah.  It's like the worst injury you can get, so, and it was right in the middle of this big,  long storyline that him and I were basically just starting to do.  So when you spend all your time and effort in putting together this storyline, and then  one of the main principles, you know, gets hurt where he's out for a year, everybody kind  of has to scramble to figure out what can we do, when is he going to come back, what, 
[01:31:00]  you know, what can we do in replacement of all these things that we had planned.  So everyone's still kind of scrambling right now, and because I've been on the other side  of the world, I don't really know exactly what's going to happen as far as, you know,  because we're the tag team champions right now, so storyline-wise, what's going to happen?  I don't know.  Wow.  Well, give us something, man, because, you know, you guys spill a little gossip, and  then all the wrestling sites pick it up, and then Opie and Anthony get some nice coverage.  So what are you going to give us today?  Well, I think what's going to happen is I'm going to end up teaming with Jim the Animal 
[01:31:30]  Norton.  Jim the Animal Norton.  How great would that be if he just picked me up by the feet and bludgeoned me around  the ring in my outfit, like at the end of Caligula?  I could just miss out.  Who the hell is that?  Jim the Animal Norton.  When I had to put that outfit on and stand next to Jericho, it really was, as a man,  it's just embarrassing.  Of course it is.  I want to say to him, like, you know, I've been hitting the gym a little bit.  You feel like such a non-man.  We took a picture together just for fun, and Jimmy's face was all white, and like you 
[01:32:00]  had this horrible non-existent tan with your leopard chin, banana hammock, and you're like,  look at me, I look terrible, this is horrible, it's the worst picture I've ever taken.  That's what he says with every picture.  I might even have it on my phone, I'm going to look for it, but that was really, it was  a fun shoot, man.  And when you see it finally put together, I'm like, that came out a lot better than I  thought it would.  You improv, I didn't know, Jericho was like, didn't you take, you like have studied  improv, this was certainly not your first time doing that. 
[01:32:30]  No, I didn't even study with, I performed for a year with the Groundlings out of L.A.,  who are pretty famous improv troupe, Will Ferrell and Sherry, et cetera, et cetera, so I had  a little bit of an idea of what to do, you know, and like you said, once you get in, those  guys are such pros, and it flows so easily.  The best part of, the best line of the show, though, is that we, I'm at this birthday party,  it's like a make-a-wish party, or so we think.  We think that the kid is sick, and that's why Jimmy shows up, because he wants to try and  buy some of the medicinal pot that the kid would have from having cancer, and then when 
[01:33:00]  Jimmy finds out that the kid doesn't have cancer, he's like, what, you don't have cancer?  That sucks.  You asshole.  I love it.  I got to shoot a scene with a kid, which was kind of, it was funny.  I was very surprised, I was really happy with the way the episode finally came out, and  it was fucking awesome.  I've got to see this, man.  Yeah, we're all going to watch.  Sounds hysterical.  I know the producers were very happy, they thought it was one of the funnier episodes that  they'd done, so, and that's completely due to me and Jimmy, of course, for no one  Of course.  Very cool.  Well, Chris, we know you have to wrestle, so we should get you off the phone here, huh? 
[01:33:30]  Good luck tonight, man.  I appreciate it, guys.  It's funny, because I was like, they said, could you do this radio interview?  I was like, fuck, I'm not doing any radio interview for anybody, and they said, oh, Anthony,  how could I refuse?  Oh, thank you, sir.  You going to be in New York soon?  Actually, yeah, we're going to be at the Nassau Coliseum on August 4th for a SmackDown TV  taping.  Fuck, I'm going to need tickets.  God damn it.  Sam will get them for me.  Hey, when you're in the area, stop by and do the show live.  All right?  Absolutely, man.  We'll have a great time. 
[01:34:00]  Thanks, guys.  All right.  See you soon, man.  Thanks a lot, man.  I say sayonara from the Philippines, eh?  Take care.  Good luck.  All right.  Chris Jericho, Z-Rock Sunday at 11 o'clock on IFC.  He's a good shit, that guy.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, he really is.  I always liked him.  That's why I was such a bummer when that whole conversation went down, because I knew it  was a misunderstanding and we would get through it.  Everyone thought it was a work.  Well, the first time we talked to him was when he was fozzy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's right.  That's how we met him.  He wouldn't break character.  And he wouldn't break character. 
[01:34:30]  And then we kept talking about the jizz fountain hair that he had.  Because he didn't want to acknowledge he was Chris Jericho.  So then me and Ant were just beating him up, talking about how awful Chris Jericho is.  With that fucking ponytail that looks like he looks like a big cock with jizz spraying  out of it.  He didn't like that too much.  We tried, but he wouldn't break character.  No.  This is a photo of me and Jericho on the thing where he hurts himself and I sneak a photo  of the two of us.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, he's in pain.  I actually am there with my camera and I aim it.  It was a fucking...  I just saw a picture of you with the little kid up on the website. 
[01:35:00]  Very cute.  We got clips from the Z-Rock episode that we just talked about.  But first, just real quick.  But first...  Danny, please go to Google.com.

[01:37:00]  Just dicks.  We're just dicks.  Just dicks.  And the best part of this is people are starting to pick up on what's going on.  Right.  Because a few blogs and minor publications have picked up on the fact that these Google trends,  we're fucking running them.  We invented hoo-hoo, the Google bomb.  The Google bomb.  Blanket Hates the Light is the number 1 fucking Google trend.  Keep Googling Blanket Hates the Light.  Oh, yeah.  Let it rip.  What comes up when you Google Blanket Hates the Light, Danny? 
[01:37:30]  Anything fun?  Yeah, what does come up anyway?  Let's see.  Add another one to it.  Blanket.  And it's cool because it comes up as the first search result because it works off of the trend.  So when you go to Google and you just type in Blanket, it looks to the trends to try to suggest what you're searching for.  Yes, Blanket Hates the Light.  It's right there.  I didn't even have to type the whole thing in.  Blanket Hates the Light.  Let's see.  So you think you could dance.  What was that?  Well, I was hoping for more like those news articles that pop up when you go to the Google Trends section. 
[01:38:00]  What the crap is this?  What the hell is that?  It's like a video.  It's – yeah, but that's for so you think you could dance.  Oh, boy.  It's not good.  No.  Don't click on that.  Don't click on that one.  All right.  It looks like somebody is using the Google Trends to try to –  To try to drive traffic to their –  And get you to download and execute a virus.  Oh, great. 
[01:38:30]  You think that was a virus?  Yes.  Kind of looked like –  Do I want to download and install something with an EXE extension on it?  Yes.  No, thanks.  Of course you do.  It's the best thing for your computers.  Oh, that's the worst.  Why is that bad?  I do that one all the time.  You don't want to execute anything?  EXEs are the best thing to download when you don't know the source.  It's usually a help for your computer.  No, they're not.  They're fucking viruses.  Hey, angry literal Jim.  What was the guy's name yesterday?  Literal angry fellow.  Little.  Let's go to Jim Norton and Chris Jericho on Z-Rock.  Wait, what clips are they? 
[01:39:00]  Because I'll tell you which ones to play.  I did.  Norton exits a restaurant plus O&A.  Got to play that one.  You got a plug-in for the show?  Dude, I got – of course I got a plug-in for the show.  I actually got – and there's one plug that didn't make the final.  Where not only do I get a plug-in for the show, but I plug Sirius XM by name –  That's what a fucking bitch I am for the company.  And they didn't do it.  They went with this clip instead.  Why can't Sirius XM take our lead?  Look how easy it is to fucking promote the show.  See?  You just say Opie and Anthony. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, we're petting them today.  Petting the dog.  Petting the dog.  Pet, pet, pet, pet.  Come here, boy.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah, I think I'm screaming leaving a restaurant.  Okay, let me take care of this.  I'll take care of it.  I'll take care of it.  Thank you.  Attention, nosy colostomy bags.  I hope you all enjoyed the show.  Fuck you.  By the way, if you did enjoy the show, you can catch me Monday through Friday on the Opie and Anthony show, weekdays 5 to 11.  And fuck you too, Randy Jackson.  There's a black guy. 
[01:40:00]  Nice.  Fucking nice.  There's a black guy.  Very nice.  Did that make the show?  That's the final cut.  Fuck you.  That's how it ends?  No, no, no.  That's in the final.  That's on the episode.  Wow.  That's very cool.  Chris Jericho falls down with a broken leg.  Norton runs over for a picture.  That's embarrassing hearing myself.  You want to bring the vodka to show you some vodka?  Chris!  Move out of the way!  Give the man some vodka! 
[01:40:30]  Who are you?  Are you a doctor?  No, no.  Just a big fan.  Can you smile?  You freaking animal.  Get away from me.  Don't touch my leg.  Don't touch my leg.  Oh, those are great boots.  You can't hear it.  Those are great boots.  You ought to see his foot.  It's so fucking twisted to the right.  It looks like his foot has actually come off his body and is just stuck in his boot.  It's really good.  It's really funny.  Dude, when he falls, the way they make his foot look is really not good.  Steven S. has given us some advice. 
[01:41:00]  We've got to still Google Blanket Hates the Light.  Supposedly, if you keep the trend high into the 10 o'clock hour, then the bloggers get hold of it.  Oh.  And then have to acknowledge our fucking stupidity.  And they won't even know what it means.  It's so obvious.  It'll just be like...  Blanket hates the light.  Poor little blanket.  Jimmy, what do you think Blanket is doing right now?  If you had a guess.  I don't know.  Probably breaking bulbs.  He's probably in the pantry.  He's probably breaking bulbs.  He probably takes hammers and they go, who broke all of these bulbs we had? 
[01:41:30]  The extras.  With his weepy little eyes.  Yes, he has like a little Fisher-Price hammer and he's breaking the extra bulbs.  With his little action figure and piece of cardboard he hides behind.  That poor little feller.  Poor little feller.  He's right now in an old shoebox.  Took out nuts and bolts and whatnot.  Fucking Blanket.  God bless Blanket.  Yes, please.  Chris Jericho announces his retirement as a pro wrestler, but announces his start as a manager and his newest superstar. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, no.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's with a heavy heart that I am forced to announce my retirement as an active pro wrestler.  I have crushed my fibula.  My bicep is torn.  Problems with my lumbar region.  My caustic bone.  But they say hope springs eternal.  And I look forward to the future.  And my future is so bright that I have to wear the proverbial shades, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:42:30]  Because I am about to embark on my brand new career.  As a pro wrestling manager, I believe that I have found the next huge superstar in this business.  He's the man of the hour, the man with the power, the man too sweet to be sour.  Ladies, please welcome Jim, the animal, Norton.  I can't wait till Sunday. 
[01:43:00]  Do we have a copy of this show?  I've got to see that scene.  Dude.  I have got to see that scene.  I'm embarrassed.  No.  It's fantastic.  I really, I look like a fucking dummy.  I don't doubt it.  I have to see it.  I am going to fucking DVR that and play it until my eyes melt.  Oh, by the way, it's on IFC.  I don't know if we were saying that.  Z-Rock on IFC is the channel.  So I'm sure you came with the fire.  The Independent Film Network or channel. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Sorry, that would be IFN.  But they have total content freedom and they're using it.  It's great.  There's no advertisers, I don't think.  We got some info on Blanket, by the way.  IFN is something else.  Brian in Philly.  Daughters do to upset their dads.  Brian.  Good morning.  Hey, Brian.  I just got word that Blanket is heading for Ted's Filament Factory with murderers and tetanus.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's not good.  Hey, he shouldn't go there.  Ted only makes one every eight months, I believe it was, or something like that. 
[01:44:00]  If anyone has any reports on Blanket, please call the show.  We're very concerned because we all know Blanket hates the light.  Blanket hates the light.  Jimmy, I got another clip from the Z-Rock show with you and Chris Jericho.  Which one?  It's called an outtake.  No, it was probably, you know what?  The outtakes weren't bloopers.  They were just similar takes.  The outtake you're talking about probably sounds just like the one with Jericho.  You can't really hear much.  Should we play him?  No, because you can't. 
[01:44:30]  It's me running through a bunch of kids.  I thought we had something.  It's me running through a bunch of kids to get a picture of Chris, but you can't really  make much out of it.  All right.  We'll just do that then.  How about we do a quick break?  Get into the Obama photo.  Ah, yes.  We'll try to find out what Blanket's up to.  If you have any reports, call the show.  I think I can play something here.  You guys want to hear the Jim C one more time?  I love the Jim C.  Or the how to approach a little person. 
[01:45:00]  Have we heard that at all?  We debuted it yesterday.  I'm scared.  All right, we'll play this.  And then we'll continue.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  By the way, we read all the instant feedback.  Yes, we do.  I wonder if little Nicky reads the instant feedback.  I don't know.  Where's little Nicky?  Hi, little Nicky. 
[01:45:30]  Goddamn, that will just go on for a year.  If we're here for 10 fucking years, it will go on for 10 years.  I don't know why.  And everyone is begging me.  They're like, you just got to get him on the show.  And I don't know if it works having him actually in studio.  No, it's like having the couple there hook up Bruce Willis and what's the name in Moonlighting.  You just don't.  Well, once it happens, it's over.  Right, right.  I like the myth of little Nicky just walking down the hall.  He's a production guy here at Sirius XM.  His shit is really good. 
[01:46:00]  Some say he's the best in the building at production.  Yep.  I said it like that because, you know, I don't want Derek getting pissed off and punching  somebody today.  Because Derek's shit is really, really good.  Derek won't get pissed off and punched.  He'll get pissed off, depressed, and just drink.  That's what Derek does.  That's what I do.  That's what Danny does.  Derek was telling me he was all excited earlier in the week.  He's like, dude, check out this list.  And he's just naming booze after booze after booze.  And I'm like, okay, so what?  And he's just like, 500 Jell-O shots this weekend. 
[01:46:30]  What the fuck?  Derek rolls, man.  I love when he hands something in for the show.  He just goes here and walks away.  He wants no part of on the air anymore or anything.  We used to kind of force him on the air.  He just wants to be behind the scenes guy.  And I never knew what a giant degenerate he was up until relatively recently.  I think it was that time Danny was over the house.  We were hanging out.  And he's like, let's call Derek and see if he wants to come over.  And I go, Derek, come over?  It doesn't seem like that. 
[01:47:00]  He goes, oh, no, that guy's a fucking drunk.  He'll drive to come over here.  It was fantastic.  Then he came over.  Oh, he came over?  Oh, fuck yeah.  That rules.  Yeah.  I think he drove like two, because he lives in Jersey, like the middle of Jersey.  So he drove like two and a half hours just to come out drinking.  Just to hang out and drink somewhere else for a little bit.  Have some company while you drink so you don't feel so bad about yourself.  Exactly.  And in true weirdo Derek fashion, he woke up really early and left.  Yeah, he just woke up early and left. 
[01:47:30]  Like, you can just hang out there.  It doesn't matter.  My house is a flop house.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  Fucking Derek.  Anyway, instant feedback.  Scott D. from SOTUS.  SOTUS?  As in SOTUS Point?  Really?  Nice little spot up there in the Rochester area.  As in this ripped piece of cloth.  Oh, is that corny and hysterical?  Well, Scott D. writes, click on Blanket Hates the Light on Google Trends. 
[01:48:00]  It is the number one Google Trend.  Yeah.  Thanks to the pest.  Yeah.  And see the related searches.  One of them is, I like to tape my thumbs to my hands to see what it would be like to be a dinosaur.  A dinosaur?  One of them is, I might have...  The show's been off the air for years.  I might have ruined the reading of that one.  One of them is, I like to tape my thumbs to my hands to see what it would be like to be a dinosaur.  Oh, okay. 
[01:48:30]  Thumbs to my hands.  Yeah, because they kind of have that weird...  All right.  It's fun to do.  Do it, Jimmy.  Come on.  Do it.  That's all I do.  I've been doing that for hours.  That was Z-Rock, Jimmy.  Jimmy the animal.  Yeah, I am in a studio.  Jimmy the slug.  Can you burst through the door as Jimmy the animal, please?  Oh, I can't because I have to break through paper, but...  All right.  Can you open the door?  Give it a little bit.  I want to see it.  I want to see the exact move you did. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, this is going to be on Z-Rock this Sunday at 11 on IFC.  Is that how you did it?  That's how you did it?  Is that how you did it?  Kind of, yeah.  Oh, it's fabulous.  Oh, no.  I want to see that now so bad.  There's nothing I want to watch now more than that.  Oh, it's good.  Do we have copies of this?  I want to see that.  I can't stay up until 11.  On Sunday night?  Yeah, just DVR.  At least you'll have it.  I want to see it now, though.  I want to see it right after the show.  Well, I think we might actually have a copy down the hall, hopefully. 
[01:49:30]  Let's find out, yeah.  All right.  Someone get that for me.  Breaking news on the AP.  This is Adam S. in Brooklyn.  Blanket is being adopted by Mr. McGregor and will live out his life in his shed painting birdhouses.  Let's make sure we take a picture.  We are looking for Blanket info today on the opening answer show.  Remember the day we, let's play the day we hung off the balcony.  Is that Mr. McGregor?  He ruled.  Did we do that justice?  Yes.  Because it was one of my favorite things ever. 
[01:50:00]  We were obsessed with him.  Ever.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Stupid young Blanket wants to spend his father's entire estate to buy a fire extinguisher large enough to put out the sun.  Blanket despises his life.  He doesn't like that life.  It makes him frightened.  Yeah.  Blanket hates the light.  That's why he has big eyes.  They're good to see you in the dark.  Yeah.  Give me my sandwich right now.  Oh, wow.  Sorry.  Kenny just walked in.  Thank you, Kenny.  Kenny.  Thank you, Ken.  It's funny how Kenny doesn't bring a Diet Pepsi when he knows damn well. 
[01:50:30]  Thank you, sir.  I'm the Diet Pepsi kid.  That's what they call you.  Yes.  A lot.  Thanks, Ken.  That's what they call me.  Why didn't Bruno come in for his movie?  Where else was he?  I haven't seen him promoting anything.  When he was Borat, he came in as Borat, and we had a great time.  The video clips did very well on YouTube.  He had fun.  We had fun.  I think it's hard to top that because he didn't break character doing the Borat thing. 
[01:51:00]  Why isn't he coming in as Bruno?  And then what's he going to do, like the same thing?  He's been doing other radio shows.  Has he?  Is he in New York?  He did my pal BJ Shea's show out there in Seattle.  No, he didn't.  I do believe he did.  All right.  Maybe he's not in the...  He's close yet.  The movie starts today.  He should have been here sometime this week.  Friday wide?  Friday wide.  People have seen it already.  Yeah.  They had midnight showings.  What are they saying?  Well, usually when there's midnight showings and we get in here around, you know, six o'clock 
[01:51:30]  or whatever and start the show, the phones are lit with reviews of these movies that are  the midnight showings.  I didn't get one today.  We didn't get...  Not a one.  Doesn't necessarily mean bad or good, does it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  No.  I don't know.  All right.  Ant, you got to admit that we all could get along with the Obama today, right?  Yeah.  Obama...  How are you going to spin this?  This is...  No, no, no.  You got to respect the Obama man today.  I, um...  You got it.  I actually like the picture of Obama today. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, where are the white women at?  Exactly.  This is where me and the president can just kind of look on and go, yes, we've found common  ground.  Everyone has seen the picture by now, right?  Do we have to even describe this?  This is the...  This is so telling.  I wonder what big-hipped Mrs. Obama is thinking when she looks at that picture.  It looks like that's her right behind Obama.  You don't see the head of this woman, but it looks like the shape of Michelle. 
[01:52:30]  Because that girl...  Well, we'll give the picture a little description.  Sure.  I'm sure everybody saw it, but there's some Frenchie.  One of the French guys.  Who is that?  Well, I'll read the caption.  Makes it easy.  Yes.  Nice can.  Again, the red-blooded presidents of the U.S. and France.  Okay, so it's the president of France.  Both presidents.  I didn't know that was the president of France.  The president of France is laughing at Obama.  Study a matter of international interest yesterday.  A 17-year-old junior delegate at the G8 in Italy. 
[01:53:00]  She is wearing a slinky little red number that is very sheer.  Very tight.  Very tight.  And her ass is just completely showing through this thing.  She is probably the whitest girl ever.  She's got lovely red locks.  And very smooth alabaster skin.  That's a great look.  She's so white, she makes Obama look like Mickey Rivers. 
[01:53:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Good call.  Thank you.  And if it was the 70s, Obama's head is craned over, just staring directly at her ass.  And the French president is looking over at Obama looking and has a smirk on his face like,  you motherfucker.  All he pictures is a Steve Martin voice coming out of the president.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Exactly, Obama. 
[01:54:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  He, uh, dude, there's no way around this.  He is dead staring at that ass.  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Yes.  Is he going to explain, what's his explanation?  Because he has to say something about this.  I think if, if, if, if I don't give a shit, or at least in private, no one should give 
[01:54:30]  a shit to his wife, he would say something like, look, uh, she was stepping up that big  step onto the platform and I was just looking to make sure she wasn't going to fall or,  uh, uh, you know, trip on that.  It's a big step.  And, well, the problem is the 17 year old though, it looks like she's not having a problem  with that step whatsoever where Obama should be going, Hey, be careful over there.  Of course not.  Maybe he was craning his neck to listen to something he could say.  No, I was just craning my neck to, I thought I heard somebody say, he is looking directly 
[01:55:00]  into her bung hole.  Maybe she farted.  He is all the better directly into the bung.  We should do a caption contest.  Do you need one?  That is just like all that.  That speaks volumes right there.  Yeah.  Yep.  This is what I do for my peeps.  Well, you don't be ready on Twitter.  I'm going to take a picture and we're going to do a little caption contest.  What are you taking a picture with?  Oh, oh, your blackberry. 
[01:55:30]  No, the pictures are good.  It's cute.  Dude.  I got a 3.2.  Fantastic.  You don't have a 3.2 MP on your fucking iPhone.  You kill me with the video.  I can't even argue that point.  Oh, my word.  How many MPs you got on that motherfucker?  Right.  How many MPs?  How many motherfuckers?  Let's go MPs, motherfucker.  I don't know.  I like the pictures that my iPhone takes.  How many fucking MPs?  That's all.  I only deal with MPs.  Does it have a flash yet in the camera on the iPhone?  No, not one flash on this.  Why not?  Because it's adaptable to the light.  It's not.  I was lying.  I'm sorry.  Blanket adapted. 
[01:56:00]  Exactly.  Blanket is not adapted.  It's a camera made for blankets.  Yes.  No flash.  Taking pictures of blanket.  No flash.  Poor little blanket.  It hates the light.  You think it hates the light?  Yeah.  All right.  No, I'm proud of my camera on the fucking BlackBerry.  It's the video that I have a major fucking problem with.  Yeah.  That is making me think about an iPhone.  And the shitty little screen size.  It's a shitty little screen on the BlackBerry.  Well, I'm losing a little faith in the BlackBerry.  I'm not going to lie to you, Ann.  Yeah.  I'm a little bummed out.  I went to the cell phone store looking at that tour, and the tour is the same as what 
[01:56:30]  I got, basically.  Yeah.  So, I have to wait until November or December.  That scares me.  Why half the fucking screen?  Whole phone, half screen.  Right.  Why you get half screen, whole phone?  Hell yeah.  Let me see how big your screen is.  Look at all the waste of fucking screen space.  Can I see your iPhone?  That is...  No, you'll break it.  No.  Damn it.  I don't want it busted.  Bruno was on Letterman last night, so he could have done our show yesterday.  Thanks for the... 
[01:57:00]  Oh, there, Julia.  Cape Cod.  ...for app updates.  What's going on?  Oh, my God.  I do.  You guys want to go to Bobo?  That's all we have in Obama, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Red-blooded fucking male looking at a hiney.  He's a little perverted.  That's not perverted.  That's not perverted.  It's just, like you said, yeah, he's a regular guy just looking to...  You're not going to spin this at all?  No, I kind of like the fact that he's...  God bless you, Anthony Cumia.  He's looking at chicks' asses.  I thought you meant the nice picture of him shaking hands and smiling at fucking 
[01:57:30]  Muammar Gaddafi.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a great photo.  Yeah.  The guy who fucking targeted our civilians on a Pan Am plane.  Yeah.  And he's on CNN Live right now.  Is he losing his hair on the sides of his head?  What the fuck?  You see that?  Yeah.  Did he get his hair cut too short?  Maybe.  So now you can kind of see the skin through the hair?  He's going for the fade.  He's bringing it back.  Oof.  He wants to look like Kidder Play.  Big Daddy Kane.  1986.  How great would it be if he goes on vacation for the... 
[01:58:00]  I'll get back with a kid in play.  Big Kid in play hairdo.  Like, okay, enough time's gone by.  I gotta let my hair out.  That would be fantastic.  And he insists every time he's walking to a microphone that they play the What's Happening  theme music.  Awful.  Yeah.  Obama's just a regular guy.  Look at that.  He is staring right down to that ass.  And the French guy laughing is great.  That's Michelle behind him, right?  Uh-huh. 
[01:58:30]  It doesn't look like her, does it?  I can't tell.  I don't think so.  No, her legs...  I think her legs are fatter than...  Who is that straight-ankled woman behind him with doll legs?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You guys want to go to the phone and talk to Bobo?  Front of Hell, yeah, of course.  Bobo wants to hype his new bit.  Good.  What is his new bit again?  It is Friday, so, you know, we gotta give Bobo his time.  I don't know how to start it, but...  Did he expose his bit yet?  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Bobo. 
[01:59:00]  Bobo.  Hey, Blow Blow.  Yeah, I got the new bit of...  I got...  And then he doesn't even say hi.  Yeah, I got the new bit.  I got the new bit.  The new bit is gonna be great.  A lot of people in the building have been saying they would think, why don't I do the  immunity challenges, similar to what David's been doing in the hallways.  Well, I decided to do that.  What?  What are you gonna do, Bobo?  Is this your new bit?  What's the bit?  Yeah, immunity challenges. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Immunity challenges.  Okay.  Similar to what David's been doing in the hallways, I heard.  Oh, right.  He's been doing a lot of those immunity challenges.  I think my girls have been telling me about that.  Aziz.  Wait, wait.  You guys just...  You can't pass that up.  Your girl?  He goes, my girl has been telling me that.  All right.  It's Chick.  He's got a girlfriend.  Wait.  Did you ever go out on that date with that Chick?  She kept saying she won because she really...  She had, like, these advanced plans in Connecticut.  I don't know.  Oh.  I was trying to get her to head up to Smithtown for the weekend. 
[02:00:00]  Well, you know.  Why didn't you go with her?  To see her family?  Smithtown for the weekend sounds fucking wonderful.  That's just like going to the Hamptons or the Jersey Shores.  Let's go see the bull.  Let's go see where the Smithtown high school kids paint the big balls red on the bull statue.  We could summer in Shirley.  Shirley.  I don't know.  She really...  What a dumb Shirley is.  And then he just plows down.  Of course he does.  Bobo.  Hold on.  Hey, Tank.  So why didn't you just go out to meet her family in Connecticut? 
[02:00:30]  She kept didn't mentioning where it was she was going.  She kept didn't mentioning?  Yeah.  She didn't feel like that.  She kept didn't mentioning.  She didn't invite me to go with her.  Oh.  Wait.  Why didn't you go with her?  He has no clue that she has no interest.  No, I figured the whole thing, don't let the pussy chase you.  Don't chase the pussy.  Don't chase the pussy.  What's wrong, Ed?  What are we looking at?  I don't know if that's the girl.  What girl? 
[02:01:00]  She looks darker than the other one with the red hair.  Yeah, somebody else is saying that she's not a white girl.  She's pretty fucking...  She's Brazilian.  She looks like...  Fucking hot, though.  She's from Brazil.  Really?  Yeah.  Because she has...  Brazilian chicks are sexy, man.  Because she has long red locks like that.  Yeah, they're reddish brown.  You know, the blonde Brazilians.  It's all colored Brazilians.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  How do you know?  I've been in Rio de Janeiro three times, man.  All right.  Is that her?  That's the dress. 
[02:01:30]  Zoom in.  Yeah, that's her.  Zoom in.  Let's get a face shot.  Hold on there, Bobo.  Come on, Bobo.  You've got to wait.  We're talking chicks here.  Chicks.  That's what we do on this show.  Chicks.  If I know what you mean, I talk about...  Oh, okay.  Wait.  There's a little bit of hurt going on there.  She isn't that cute?  She looks better from the back.  Her hiney is way better.  Her face looks a little third-world-ish.  She should put her hiney on her shoulders and her face on her hiney area.  Oh, Bob.  She should teach you to walk back with.  She, um... 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  I'm not feeling that front face thing.  The other picture, she looked a little better, right?  Yeah.  Not the rear picture.  The other front face pic?  She's about a six.  Let's see the other face pic.  No.  Her ass is a ten, but her overall score is a six.  Obama was probably saying that to, uh...  How do you say his name is?  Sarkozy?  Scorsese?  Not him, fuck!  I love when me and Jimmy get angry for no reason. 
[02:02:30]  Jesus Christ.  It's no reason angry, guys.  No, is it Scorsese?  Sarkozy, I'm sorry.  Can you zoom in on that, Danny?  I gotta see, because...  That might have been an awkward picture, because she looks kind of cuter in that picture.  Bobo, go.  Get your old to my cousin.  She's pretty.  Yeah, she's not bad.  I gotta send that image to my cousin.  She's definitely a pretty girl.  She's even better there.  Yeah, Bobo.  That's better.  Overall score is now up to a seven and a half. 
[02:03:00]  Bobo.  Seven and a half.  Yeah.  What were you saying, Bobo?  I gotta say that.  I think she's definitely attractive.  Yeah.  Definitely.  What was that?  What was that?  The hot girl in the middle?  The guy with the beard who's looking one way, and she's looking the other?  Yeah.  Obama's going.  That looks familiar.  Yeah, Obama's going, I'd like to tap that ass.  Yeah.  I bet he actually just said, nice shit cutter.  Look how white her legs and arms are, though.  Well, it's a flasher.  It's an outdoor event.  I don't know what that means.  I don't either.  What a fucking... 
[02:03:30]  What a shitter, as they say.  And look, it looks like he's trying to hide a boner.  Look at his legs are almost bowed in a little bit at the knees.  Oh, you think he's moving his knees together?  And he's hunching over.  He's trying to hide the fucking Obama boner.  The old boner.  That's how you hit a boner as a kid.  Barack O'Boner.  That's how you hit a boner as a kid.  You were so shamed.  Yes, you were very shamed of your boner.  You were putting knees together like this?  Oh, no.  Put them together.  I used to, as everybody knows, I would get hard-ons on the bus. 
[02:04:00]  I would get boners on the school bus.  No reason.  It wasn't that there was a girl in there that I was looking at.  It wasn't the vibrations.  It was just this fucking, I don't know what it was, a psychological thing that when I got  on the school bus in the morning, I got a boner.  And then when I'd get off the school bus, it would go away.  But getting off the school bus, I'd have to hold my books in front of my boner.  Because I was very afraid that someone would see my boner. 
[02:04:30]  Odd.  Bobo.  Yeah, I was going to say, my cousin always gives a lot of Obama conspiracies.  I got to show this.  What is this?  What is this, Danny?  It's a video that's been going around for quite some time.  Yeah?  Of Jean-Claude Van Damme and some really hot chick.  Oh, yeah, I remember this video.  He's got a boner.  What's wrong with him? 
[02:05:00]  And he's got a fucking boner.  And he's got a big, giant boner.  Look at his boner.  Oh, man, damn boner.  This is a great video.  He's grinding on some fucking hot chick.  He's got a big fucking boner.  It's some, oh, who farted?  Jimmy did.  Wow, he has a big fucking mule.  And he's popping a rod.  I popped a boner.  Oh, my God.  That's solid.  That's, it's been a while since you unleashed the fucking Kraken.  That's a fucking, that's an SMF, kids. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  The spoiled meat fart.  Oh, wow.  Is he trying to hide?  Look, he's trying to hide his.  And now he's trying to hide that he has a boner.  And, of course, it's foreign TV, so they're pointing and laughing at it.  Like Opie pointing at the fucking Iron Sheik's urine stain.  American TV, that would never.  No.  I know.  They, they, they're not shy over there.  I'm surprised they didn't take mallets out and start hitting it.  Hitting it.  Like whack-a-mole.  Whack-a-mole.  Oh, wait, that would be Japanese TV.  Get two Japanese guys in helmets. 
[02:06:00]  They each grab his foreskin and run a different direction.  Right.  Fucking dumb Japanese game show crap.  Whoever lets go first has to wash his hands on the other guy's mouth.  Fucking awful TV.  Bobo, what do you got for the show today?  Yeah, Bobo.  Come on now.  Right.  What's going on with you and your girlfriend?  Supposedly you're in a girl here at SiriusXM.  What happened, Bobo?  It's not working out so far.  She's coming up with a lot of excuses.  Where are we at with this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like the time they pass her if she wants to go out with me. 
[02:06:30]  She always comes up with some kind of excuse.  Yeah.  Sounds like a bunch of bunk to me, Bobo.  Yeah, what's up?  What do you think of it?  Well, it sounds like she's just busy.  It is summertime.  I think you should, you know, keep trying there, Bobo.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I keep trying.  I keep trying to call.  I'll be calling over the weekend.  Of course.  Oh, good.  Why don't you show up dressed better?  You always dress like some fucking bum.  Why don't you come in here one time with your hair slicked?  Dress like a gentleman with a carnation.  And a tuxedo. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, why don't you come in dressed nice, like a true gentleman,  asking a lady for an evening on the town?  Yeah, what are you doing?  You're not offering this girl anything.  Yeah, you're giving her nothing.  You're just showing up, babe, with your hat.  Why don't you stop with the hat and slick your hair back and come in in gentleman's attire?  Look all smooth.  I'll show up like that.  Yes.  Remember like I did the other day?  No.  No one remembers.  What, when you finally washed the pit stains out of your hockey jersey? 
[02:07:30]  Show up dressed like a gentleman.  All right.  Enough with the chick.  That'll work out eventually.  What's up with this new bit?  Well, everybody, even she was, even the chick was saying that she loved those immunity challenges  that intern David was doing.  She thought those were hilarious.  And everybody else was saying, why don't you do that?  So I figured that's what I'll be doing the next time I'm there.  So what are you going to do?  Hey.  Do we have one yet? 
[02:08:00]  Well, I guess maybe they could come up with stuff.  What?  Oh, I know.  Bubba, you could suck your brother's dick.  Oh, the guy's guy.  Those rumors are not true.  Really?  Those rumors are not true.  I haven't, there hasn't been anything going on between me and him.  Not, not, not now, but we all know what happened.  Right.  Yeah.  When you were, you know, years ago.  Right?  Well, if it happened, I don't. 
[02:08:30]  I have no idea what happened.  You were the one that told us.  You're the one that told us.  No, no, they, someone thinks that they, I forgot who it was that thought that that  might have happened, but someone in the building thought it happened, misheard what I would  say.  But it was you that said it.  That's why people, like, were saying it.  So obviously, you know, something happened, whatever.  Well, I think they heard, they heard part of the words that I was saying.  Well, now I don't remember what I would say now, that day.  So, Bobo, you're calling to hype a new bit, but. 
[02:09:00]  What's the bit?  But what's the bit?  It's the immunity challenges.  What's that mean?  Yeah, what is that?  What the fuck is it?  I don't know.  David was doing a bunch of crazy stuff.  I don't know.  They made, I don't know.  They once made him try to get out of a straight jacket out of a box.  I figured I'd start with that.  That's what you're tying up the phone lines with?  You want to get out of a straight jacket someday out of a box?  Harry, who dummy?  All right, maybe that'll be good. 
[02:09:30]  And not only that, I'll probably try to go ahead and eat a bunch of sliders and see who will puke with the photo of the shit.  What?  No one knows what you, we're all looking at each other flabbergasted.  We have no clue what you're talking about.  Yes, we're flabbergasted by you.  I was going to eat a bunch of White Castle sliders, right?  Cool.  Great.  And then take a picture of the shit that it causes, right? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  And then see who I could make puke with the photo.  No one.  Just play this segment for them.  I'm sure that will do it.  I'd rather watch a flounder flop around on a table for an hour.  Yes.  Half dead.  Right.  Bobo, call us when you got this figured out.  I know, I'm going to eat sliders and then bring in the napkins  and see if they can tell which ones they wipe my hands on.  It's the most horrendous bit idea I've ever heard.  I'm going to drink a Schwepp's Diet Ginger Ale and then when I'm halfway through, 
[02:10:30]  make the clinkling sound with the can.  That would be a fantastic video.  Bobo, what are you doing?  That idea's terrible.  Yeah.  We hate your idea.  It's no Springsteen.  Well, I thought the other one is I'm going to see if I could somehow find a way to make  what I would say is I was going to make E-Rock puke by the picture of the shit in the bathroom.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[02:11:00]  And then the other one I was going to do, I was going to try to,  I was going to just walk around posing as Tippy Tom.  What?  Where?  Why would you do that?  What do you mean?  How would you do it?  And what would, why?  Posing where is Tippy Tom?  No, no.  Because he looks nothing like Tippy Tom.  No, you can't pose as Tippy Tom.  You don't sound like him.  You don't look like him.  You don't drink.  You don't smell like him.  You have a home?  You don't want him looking like Tippy Tom?  I don't get it.  Hi, I'm Tippy Tom. 
[02:11:30]  No, you're not.  Look, I'm posing as him.  I'm boo-boo Tom.  In the future, I was going to, at some point, I was going to dress like the guy  and then even spray liquid ass on myself.  That'll be magic.  Magic.  Some liquid ass might be funny.  If you sprayed that on the back of your pants and went into an elevator, that's funny.  Kind of would be.  See, that's a funny bit.  That's a funny bit.  You could be liquid ass stink guy.  Yeah, because David's old hat.  We don't even remember David.  That would work.  Liquid ass stink guy. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Where we put liquid ass on you and then you go into situations that will be embarrassing.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Bobo, if we get some voicemails that you left for your girlfriend, can we play him on  the air?  Yeah, if you could.  Yeah, if you could.  Okay.  You got him?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Holy mother of Jesus.  Yeah, you hold the line, Bobo.  Yeah.  You fucking hold on there.  You fucking hold right the fuck there.  You get those.  How long is this going to take?  Well, hopefully 30 seconds or less. 
[02:12:30]  She's here because she board ops for another show at this time, so she can't come on the  air.  That sucks a dick.  Come on.  Get her in here.  Bobo called her like nine times this weekend.  Someone else can't fucking hop on the board for a second?  She's got two voicemails and like nine missed calls from Bobo this weekend.  Someone can't just board op for her while she comes in here for two seconds so we could  even just say hi to her?  They get mad here.  Who gets mad here?  The people.  They get mad here.  Because they think there's other shows going on besides ours.  Yeah.  Please.  Come on. 
[02:13:00]  Give me a break.  Exactly.  Fucking get her off the board.  It'll be fun.  Board op.  Somebody could sit there for two seconds while she comes on the most popular show in the  whole world.  Her supervisor will get mad.  Who's her supervisor?  I don't know.  We'll fire that person.  We can do that?  Yes.  We can do that.  We got pull.  Major pull.  Look at what we did in Google Trends.  That's right.  Blanket hates the light.  That's right.  Look at that spike.  Look at that spike.  Blanket hates the light. 
[02:13:30]  Just keep putting blanket hates the light in Google.  Make them have to talk about us again today.  Why does Blanket hate the light?  Who is Blanket?  What is this?  Poor little fucking scared Blanket.  All right, Bobo.  Hold on.  This is not just a crush Bobo has, by the way.  They are officially boyfriend-girlfriend.  Is that true, Bobo?  According to Bobo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why we like to speak with her.  Well, she says it.  She says it, too, when they're together. 
[02:14:00]  I've seen them together.  Yeah?  You know.  And what?  Although, I'll tell you this.  There was some drama last week on Friday.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Because Bobo came back towards the office, and she was there.  And?  And I go, Bobo, why aren't you talking to your chick?  And he goes, because she's talking to E-Rock.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  And E-Rock was definitely trying to, you know.  Wheel his way in there?  Wheel his way into that poontang.  God damn E-Rock.  And I was like, Bobo. 
[02:14:30]  And then Bobo stood up for himself.  Isn't he engaged to be married?  That's what I'm saying.  That doesn't stop, E-Rock.  No, man.  You don't know that E-Rock actually has game?  He's a cold-hearted player.  He really does have game.  You know, it's funny.  We think that he's just putting weight on, but inside of his neck, it's all girls' phone  numbers stored.  That's why it's taking on a pelican-ish quality.  Oh.  We just thought it was fish.  Yeah.  Yes, we thought it was rotting fish.  And other things that curious petting zoo tourists had thrown to him. 
[02:15:00]  Look, Bobo, a talking fat-necked bird.  No, that's just a man getting audio for a radio show.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Mama, why bird no shave?  All right.  So, Bobo, E-Rock is moving in on your territory.  How do you feel about that?  Yeah.  I'm going to have to let his girl he's engaged to know.  Oh, so you're going to rat him out.  That's good.  And that'll keep him away.  I'm going to rat him out.  And not only that, if I find him asleep on the job, guess what I'm going to do?  Spray liquid ass on him. 
[02:15:30]  Yes.  Oh, damn, you're fucking cruel.  Dude, why don't you just put your cock in his mouth like your brother did to you?  Right.  When you were growing up.  Remember?  Maybe we could, I don't know, doctor a picture and put it on his desk, tape it to his desk.  Why acknowledge we talked?  Yeah, you just plow through the thought.  He gets a thought.  Nothing stops it.  No.  No.  Why would you acknowledge sound?  I can always, when he's asleep, just for the heck of it, get a picture of my cock on the back of his head just to really embarrass him. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  You know what?  I'll go board op.  Get the chick in here.  You're going to, why not?  They can't argue.  You won't be board op-ing.  Yeah.  He's a celebrity.  It'd be a big fucking deal for them.  I'll be right back.  And she can come in here and we can fucking have a little chit-chat with her.  See if she can come in during the break.  Okay.  Come on.  Do something.  Come on.  Get someone else to board op. 
[02:16:30]  Come on.  By the way, Sam, take your time because, you know, it's not like we're live or anything.  Come on.  Floundering.  Don't run in front of a million people.  Just take your time.  Hey, Mad Magazine feet.  Get the fucking.  Really?  Sam and his shitty pointed out feet.  Take your clown shoes off.  Maybe you run faster.  Exactly.  Hey, sciatic problem soon.  Get fucking.  Right.  Get those voicemails.  Hey, no hint of a muscle.  Are you fucking hurry down the hall?  Oh, he's in awful shape, Sam.  By the way, I got something to say about Sam.  Oh, good.  Oh, what do you got on Sam? 
[02:17:00]  Uh-oh.  He figured out my email password.  What was it, Bobo?  No, I'm not going to say what it was.  The old password was Shannon, my sister's name.  Oh.  But I changed it.  Why are people still, like, using real words?  Yeah.  It's.  Now it's probably this chick's name.  Sam, you figured out Bobo's password?  No, I figured out part of Bobo's password.  It was Bobo in there somewhere, right? 
[02:17:30]  Well, no, because, like, you know how, like you said, when he gets a thought, he just has  to continue to go with it?  And, like, if you want to get some information, he'll go, oh, no, I'm not going to tell you  that.  And you just go, okay.  And go back to what you were doing.  And he'll go, no, but what I will tell you.  And I just start giving you hints.  Sam is a fucking douchebag.  Okay.  Okay.  And then he'll just start giving you hints.  What the fuck goes on here after we leave?  It's just stunning.  It's stunning to me. 
[02:18:00]  Sam runs the place.  He's calling at 11.  Well, what did the girl say?  She said, Christina, as a commercial break at 9.10, she said she might be able to, like,  run in here for, like, 30 seconds.  Ah, fuck that.  Why can't someone board up for them?  Can you get audio?  Can you talk to her and we'll get the audio on after the show or something?  Yeah, I just record her.  Or Monday.  She said she would get fired.  Like, she was like, I said, what if Opie sits in for you?  And she said, no, my boss will fire my ass.  Well, who's her boss?  Like, can't Steve Blatter override him if we ask him? 
[02:18:30]  I don't know who her boss is.  What's the protocol here?  What person does she board up for?  The Psychic Show.  All right.  Stop it.  You know what?  Can we have Steve Blatter come in, please?  I love to have her ask the Psychic guy if she'll be fired.  Yeah, exactly.  Then?  I love the variety at SiriusXM, but do we need a Psychic Show?  I just said that's a little niche.  The Psychic Show, like, she takes callers and they ask questions and everything.  Yeah.  But before the caller can say, yes, that's correct or no, that's incorrect. 
[02:19:00]  Like, they'll say, I lost my keys.  And she'll say, check your bag, next caller.  It's not like, yeah, they're in here.  You never get that.  You don't get a solution?  No.  Oh, how about this?  It's not a fucking-tastic show.  Maybe.  That's brilliant.  The Psychic Show.  Do we have a phone number for that?  Because maybe some of our listeners have things that they would like solved by a psychic.  You better run tape, motherfuckers.  Oh, no.  Why not?  I think that our listeners...  Well, you know what?  The boss doesn't want to work with us. 
[02:19:30]  Guess what he gets?  I think our listeners...  A complete takeover of that horseshit show.  I think our listeners have problems that could be best served by a psychic.  As long as they're legitimate psychic questions.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  I just want to yellow flag myself, but it sounds too fun.  It's Friday.  Why?  What's wrong with that?  There's nothing wrong with...  I didn't even know there was a psychic show, and there's nothing wrong with our listeners  getting the same benefits from a psychic that other people get. 
[02:20:00]  Yes.  I care about our listeners, and I think that they can benefit from it.  I agree.  I agree.  Sam ran, so...  Where's the fucking studio?  I don't know.  It's psychic.  It's like right over there.  Is it right over there?  Yeah.  All right.  It's not far.  Good.  I just want to see...  The thing is, here's what I'm curious about.  Here's the thing.  I want to see how high Bobo aims.  I want to see how high he's aiming.  You haven't seen her? 
[02:20:30]  No.  Really?  Not bad.  Not bad?  Not bad.  Hmm.  Look at Sam run.  Oh, good God.  Oh, God.  Look at him running.  Oh, my God.  Look at those feet.  Oh, my God.  He's running.  Occasionally, his feet spin backwards, and he starts running in the opposite direction.  What's this, Sam?  You run like a cartoon character.  Yeah.  I'm very animated.  I'm very animated.  Did you get the number?  Yes, I did.  The show is Angels on Call.  Are we... 
[02:21:00]  Angels on Call?  We're recording down the hall.  Did you get some of that?  Yeah.  We better be recording.  God damn, you stink.  Can't help it.  I'm frightened.  Oh, my God.  Come on, now.  I have the pre-flight jitters.  Dude, you know what?  Thank God, because I smelled that, and I thought it was my food pocket acting up.  For real.  Would you be dead possum?  Holy shit.  What's the number, Sam?  Let's just get help.  Only if you really need help.  Absolutely.  Yes, yes.  Only if you need a psychic.  With a psychic issue.  Only if you need a psychic.  Don't call to goof or anything like that.  That wouldn't be nice. 
[02:21:30]  Only if you need a psychic to ask real psychic questions.  Okay.  Right.  Thank you.  It's 1-888-4102-102.  1-888-4102-102.  Okay.  I get frightened of psych.  Bobo, we're going to let you go.  Yeah.  You've been a monumental dud today.  You've been a flop.  All right.  You'll see me next week. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  Oh, we will?  Can't wait.  Dress nice next week, though.  Yeah.  You're like a gentleman, Bobo.  Real nice.  All right.  No problem.  I got those pants I was wearing two weeks ago, and they're just a button-down.  Bobo, do you drive?  Hell no.  No, I don't drive.  I don't have a license.  Oh, I was going to lend you the fucking Shelby so you can impress the girl.  Well, that's what I'm working on right now is getting my license.  Oh, okay.  When you get it, I'll lend you the Shelby, and that'll impress her. 
[02:22:30]  Everyone's asking the channel number so they could turn our show off and turn that show  on.  All right.  That'll be impressive.  I'm a huge Ford Mustang fan myself.  Am I a ghost?  I think I'm a ghost.  With Bobo.  I'm in the room, right?  You see me, right?  You're right there.  Anyway, you guys have a good week at punching out.  I wish someone would punch you out.  Holy shit.  Not even a clue that a communication is happening. 
[02:23:00]  Chuck Nice stays on fucking TV.  Yeah, he's just got the biggest gig on TV these days.  Pop culture guru, that guy.  He's on like two or three different shows every day.  He's on fucking...  He looks good on TV, man.  Chuck's very good on TV.  I'm happy for him.  Good guy.  Yeah, he's a really nice dude.  I like Chuck Nice.  Hey, Twitter.  Kevin Smith.  Holy shit.  And his tweet from yesterday is getting a lot of attention.  Yeah.  And I read it because I follow him.  I think his is that Kevin Smith. 
[02:23:30]  Can you pop that up?  He wasn't filming yesterday, or he was doing a night shoot, so he was hanging out.  And you've got to see what he tweeted.  Un-fucking-believable.  What's your problem with Kevin Smith?  No.  No problem.  I might be checking out some car crashes tonight.  Oh.  Did he get rid of it?  Maybe.  He was talking about having sex with his wife.  Oh.  Wow.  He tweets a lot, though.  Yeah, he does.  I thought I tweeted a lot.  Holy shit.  Well, he's got a big fan base that he likes to keep in touch with. 
[02:24:00]  Keep going down.  It was some...  No, he's talking about boners and having sex with his wife and her brown taint area.  I mean...  How does he do that in 140 fucking characters?  You see it there?  Well...  You run out of those characters very quickly, by the way.  But it's a good thing.  It makes you edit.  This show is never short of characters.  Oh, Jimmy.  He was basically saying he had the day off. 
[02:24:30]  He was doing...  I think he was hinting he was smoking pot and having sex with his wife.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, this is the first that I see.  What does it say?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Wasn't fishing for it, but appreciate all the love nonetheless.  Let's change the subject.  Amazing week of hardcore stoner sex with the wife.  Okay, yeah.  Go up.  And then it goes...  Ten years in, and we bone like we're cheating on each other with each other.  A decade plus with her clit brown taint area still owns my dick. 
[02:25:00]  He is a fucking funny man.  Keeps going, though.  Oh, man.  On a roll this week, we fuck twice a day every day since Sunday.  With little fanfare, I'm trying to make it a solid four weeks straight.  Holy crap.  His wife doesn't mind these type of tweets?  It's not.  All right.  There you go.  And some bloggers have picked up on that, and they're blogging about Kevin Smith and his tweets.  And his sex life.  Yeah, good.  Kevin should be getting some ass. 
[02:25:30]  Sweet guy.  All right.  I guess we'll break.  I got to tinker.  Sure.  Oh!  Pelosi got involved with that Michael Jackson honor, that dumb...  Yes, that stupid congresswoman.  It was a congresswoman, right?  Everyone saw that during the memorial.  She got up there.  She wants some kind of plaque or some kind of shit.  Do we have her clip?  Because how adamant she was that this was going to be a mission in her life.  Was she a black gal?  Of course.  Yeah, we'll play the clip from the memorial, and then Pelosi got involved.  Ooh.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Coming up next.  Ah, Opie and Anthony heading toward the weekend.  Oh!  Dana White's calling.  Yes.  All right.  Jimmy's flying out to Vegas for the UFC pay-per-view.  Tomorrow night, Jimmy?  Well, I fly out.  No, I mean tomorrow night's the pay-per-view.  Yes, it's Saturday the 11th, and I think it starts at 7 o'clock East Coast time.  I could be wrong.  I'm sure Dana will clear that up.  But, yeah, it's a really good card, man.  I want to get out there today for the weigh-in, because I want to try to get a meeting with  a Brock Lesnar. 
[02:26:30]  We'll try.  We'll see what happens.  What?  You're out in the room.  We'll explain it in a little while.  I just realized it's July 10th.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thank you.  No.  This is the only day it's not your birthday, because it's Brother Elmo's birthday.  Oh.  I think he's still on MySpace.  I don't think he's updated to Facebook or Twitter yet.  It's the 10th.  Oh, no.  I think he does have a Facebook, too.  Tomorrow's the 11th.  Brother Elmo's birthday, so you might want to send him some nice words. 
[02:27:00]  I believe Dawn's birthday is Monday.  Oh, really?  Yes, the 13th.  There you go.  Happy birthday to Dawn.  Well, we could do it on Monday, too, for her.  I don't know where Sam went.  Is it Monday or Sunday?  Monday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Thursday.  Friday, Wednesday, Sunday.  Monday's the 13th.  Monday.  Monday's the 13th.  Yeah.  Here comes Sam running again.  We got Bobo voicemails.  Bless you.  Bless you, my love.  Thank you.  We were going to move on, but Sam was able to get the voicemails of Bobo. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Try to ask Christina?  Yeah, Christina.  Christina out.  Who works on a show called what?  Angels on Call.  How's that going?  It's good.  Yeah?  We got a lot of calls?  We're recording it.  Angels on Call.  Psychic.  It gives you a little help.  Angels on Call.  We all need help sometimes.  Yeah?  I know I do.  Do you guys believe in psychics?  I sure do.  Ugh.  I can't find something.  That's why I call.  Horrendous.  There was only one psychic. 
[02:28:00]  That's my mom.  Oh, God.  That's shyster.  What happened to her?  You don't believe in psychics.  Cleo.  I do.  No.  Come on.  I do.  Come on.  Come on.  One time I called and I said, I can't find my sunglasses.  Oh, what did they say?  Look on your face.  That's where they were.  It's a scam.  They talk very vague and then wait for you to go, oh, my God.  That's true.  Yes.  I knew it.  They always get me.  They're always right. 
[02:28:30]  Really?  Yes.  That vague shit.  I sense you're looking for something.  Yes!  What am I looking for?  What am I looking for?  They lead you on and then you as the dummy, you're showing your face.  And this thing you're looking for, it's more an emotional thing than a materialistic thing.  No, it's a hat!  Well, that's what I meant.  Like, but the hat means something to you.  That's what they would do.  It's like, now it's a materialistic thing.  It's not an emotional thing.  But the hat means something to you, so it's emotional. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  A hat.  So the hat is missing.  Yes!  It was, uh, I left it in the cab.  In a cab.  And, uh, you lost it on a journey.  How do you know these things?  I'm seeing you, I'm seeing that the hat was lost on a journey that you were taking.  You're the devil!  I love the psychics on the boardwalk.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You've got this amazing power, but you're going to, like, charge $10 for a fucking reading on a boardwalk. 
[02:29:30]  That's the amazing thing.  You get such great discounts with them.  You're on a boardwalk.  Right.  Hoping someone's going to come into your tiny, tiny little space, because business isn't that good.  Coming!  Right.  Stupid psychics.  Sam!  Yeah?  Hey, Sam!  Hi, everyone.  So give us a quick summary here.  You've got Bobo, who's a retard.  Bobo.  And he's trying to ask this Christina out.  Who's a lovely girl.  Yeah, she's fantastic.  She's sexy, I think.  I've seen her, too.  I don't think we've really talked to her yet. 
[02:30:00]  You want to?  Yeah, we will.  Okay.  Right now?  Yeah.  Well, should we do the voicemails first?  Where are we at?  I think we should bring her in first.  Okay, let's go.  If she doesn't have time.  Oh, Sam, he's running.  Here he goes.  Look, look.  Ah, he looks stupid when he runs.  Hey, really fast.  I explained a number 11 thing on Ron and Fez.  Oh, no.  Oh, you didn't fart now when a girl's coming in every goddamn time.  I forgot.  Every time.  I forgot.  I'm stupid. 
[02:30:30]  Every time a girl comes in.  I want to spray something.  Stop spraying in your pants.  What were you saying, dude?  That's all right.  Pretty bad.  Are you holding your breath?  Sam's getting Christina.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Here she is, everyone.  Hi.  Hi.  Jimmy just farted.  Jimmy farted.  It's horrible.  He does it every time.  Shit. 
[02:31:00]  Wow.  Do you really work on a psychic show?  Yeah.  Do you like it?  I do.  We could get you a better job.  We're very powerful here.  I hear.  You guys had a million TVs.  We're jealous.  Well, we're missing a TV, and I was too scared to tell Jimmy where our missing TV is right  now.  I think I found out where it is.  Uh-oh.  Did it end up in somebody else's studio?  Good job.  Thanks.  He's spraying a wall around you.  Fucking horrible.  He's spraying a wall around you.  Oh, Danny.  Sure.  Our missing TV went to, I forgot his name. 
[02:31:30]  Baloney Tits?  Who's the old man?  I forgot his name.  I really did.  What?  Alex Bennett.  Oh, Alex Bennett.  So why don't we get our TV back?  Just get it back.  Alex Bennett has one of our TVs right now.  Get it back.  Get it back.  You know, the guy that gives us the finger every day.  You know what?  He asked for that on purpose just to take it from our studio.  Oh, yeah.  Son of a bitch.  Get it back.  Hi, by the way.  Hi, Christina.  We haven't met, I don't think.  No.  No.  Everybody was talking about you.  Nice to meet you.  Yeah, I heard.  Nice to meet you.  Yeah.  There's a lot of running around going on outside. 
[02:32:00]  What do you do on the psychic show?  I engineer it and play produce.  Yeah?  You know the guy's full of shit, though, right?  It's a female.  Oh, it's a female?  She puts the hairs in the back of my neck.  She makes the hairs in the back of my neck stand up a lot.  Really?  She freaks me out a little bit.  She's good?  Could she give Jimmy a reading?  Yeah, I mean, she, yeah, definitely.  What time's your show at?  Like we haven't dumped everything we know on the air about ourselves.  Yeah, but she comes in and you're freaks.  She finds missing children.  No.  I swear to God, I've seen it.  Oh, Uncle Paul. 
[02:32:30]  They're at Uncle Paul's house.  Yeah.  All the time.  They're all playing Parcheesi.  Does she have a good reputation out there?  Yeah, she does.  What's her name?  Mariocino.  Maybe I should have an open mind about this.  Maybe she's got something going on.  I think it's Holcomb.  Well, it's the boardwalk psychics that maybe makes the ones that have the real gifts.  The gift.  I went into the show 0% Believing and now I about 65% believe.  So, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Sometimes, what, 35, is it 35, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, wait a minute, 65, 75, 85, 95. 
[02:33:00]  No, no, 40.  And then that is 35.  Right.  What?  I'm lost.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I was doing percentages.  You started it.  What did she do on the show that really freaked you out?  Well, she found a missing kid in Kansas and she's never been to Kansas before.  She knows nothing about Kansas.  On the show live?  Yeah.  Dorothy.  There's a little dog with her.  Where'd she say the kid was?  In Sandy Hook or Sandy something. 
[02:33:30]  In New Jersey?  No, no, no.  In Kansas.  She got it, though.  Sandy Hook.  She's talked to cops before.  Was that a national story when they found the kid?  In Kansas.  Talked to cops, too.  Just in Kansas.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I was going so fast.  It was a big deal.  A lot of people call her up so that they read the paper obsessively and then they try to  help the police.  She does it.  She's amazing.  Your boyfriend?  No.  I thought Bobo was your boyfriend.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Breaking news.  See, I blurted that out just to get the honest answer. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, that was amazing.  And there was a quick no.  See, we're psychics, too.  Now, Bobo is under this impression that you are his girlfriend.  He apparently leaves voicemails.  He does.  He leaves voicemails.  He calls me on a regular basis.  Now, how did he get your number?  Can we back up, though?  How did this whole romance start with you and Bobo?  Go ahead, Sam.  Sam was the matchmaker.  Oh, good old Sam.  Fucking Sam again.  Well, I just noticed the two of them kind of looking at each other one day.  Oh, he's so full of shit. 
[02:34:30]  And so, you're full of shit now.  Go ahead.  And she's blushing.  And so, I introduced...  So are you.  I just have rosy cheese.  Yes.  I introduced...  You might be blushing.  What's that about, Sam?  No, you really are.  Look, yeah, no, it's getting rosy, right?  A little rosacea.  It's probably because he ran down the hallway.  Yeah.  He's all flush.  Yeah.  It's because all you boys are looking at me.  That's what it is.  Go ahead.  But I introduced the two of them, and they really hit it off.  I said that...  I told Bobo that I just noticed her kind of looking at him. 
[02:35:00]  And then Bobo went over to talk to her.  And I mean, from there, you know, the storybook romance writes itself.  They just...  Writes itself, huh?  Yeah.  And you see him chit-chatting in the hallways?  All the time.  Every Friday, they just talk and talk and talk.  Yeah.  What do you guys talk about?  He talks to me about the Mets.  Yes.  He's very...  He wants to go on about those Mets.  He wants to get married in Citi Field, but I told him I'm a Yankees fan, so he said we'd  meet in the middle and get married in Brooklyn. 
[02:35:30]  It's a big deal.  Oh, wow.  It's a big deal.  How does that relationship...  You guys are all jealous.  Look at you.  All of you.  How does the relationship work with you being a Yankee fan and him being such a staunch  Mets fan?  Well, we're having some difficulties, apparently.  That seems to be the biggest problem, right?  The biggest obstacle.  That and when he calls me and his mom yells at him on the other line.  Mom, please.  I'm trying to do this now.  I'm trying to do this now, Bob.  I'm trying to do this.  I have a girlfriend.  It breaks my heart.  It's a girlfriend.  I have... 
[02:36:00]  She works at a Sirius XM satellite video.  About two weeks ago, we were sick of having Bobo around, so he told him to scram, and he  said he was waiting for Christina, and Christina said, don't worry, Bobo.  I'll just meet you outside.  I just have something to do.  And guess what Christina did?  Ditched him.  Oh, yeah.  Took a helicopter off the roof.  I was working really hard.  I do a lot of things for here, and I was working really hard, yeah.  I got pulled into a studio, and I was there for hours. 
[02:36:30]  You know what would be a great bit, and it would, like, anger Bobo?  Me and you went out.  Wouldn't that be terrible?  That would probably get Bobo all mad.  It would be a great bit for the radio.  What's his name?  Whose name?  The guy that Bobo almost killed?  You rock?  Oh, you know Fat Matt, the angry intern?  Yeah.  He went over one day and put...  We did a social experiment to see how Bobo would react to another man and me.  Oh.  And I almost got knocked out.  Really?  That's how bad it was, yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Wow.  What happened, Sam?  Well, he was told to put his arm around Christina while Bobo was not looking.  And then Bobo was told, turn around, look what's happening.  And Bobo reacted with physical assault.  He was fierce.  Physical violence.  It was fierce, yeah.  Is he here today?  Fat Matt?  Yeah.  Oh, look at Fat Matt run.  Oh, my God.  He's not going to stop.  He's going to go right through the window.  He has to stop, like, 20 feet before he actually asks.  It's like a locomotive.  Fat Matt. 
[02:37:30]  In a runaway train.  Were you part of this social experiment?  Sadly, yes.  What do you mean, sadly?  It wasn't that bad for you to put your arm around me?  Come on.  No, but almost getting assaulted by a mongoloid.  Yes.  That was a bothersome.  Wow.  So you put your arm around Chris.  That was a bothersome.  That was a bothersome.  Did Matt say that was a bothersome?  He is so flustered.  I'm flustered.  Why are you flustered?  He was just running.  Yes.  Oh, is that it?  You guys are too young to be out of breath.  I know.  Look at the size of her.  What the fuck is wrong with you guys?  You have a point.  But Sam, you get out of breath, too. 
[02:38:00]  No, no.  And you weigh 120 pounds.  I don't get out of breath.  You put your arm around Christina, then what happened?  As soon as I did that, I said hello.  And then Bobo reached over to try to punch me in the face.  Yes, that's true.  Then shoved me off of her, almost knocking Christina over and myself.  Wow.  This is all true.  He is obsessed.  A fucking nut job.  He's obsessed a little bit.  See, but you have the soft spot in your heartworm.  I don't have ice running through my veins, that's all.  Oh, my gosh.  You noticed? 
[02:38:30]  Try it someday.  Yeah.  You sleep like a baby.  Yeah.  Well, then maybe I'll try it.  Yeah, give it a whirl.  It's kind of fun.  So, Matt, it was an uncomfortable experience?  Yes, it was an uncomfortable experience.  And an uncomfortable experience.  You cannot speak to that.  No, I cannot.  He was aggressive to you?  Yes, very much so.  I think you like Christina, too.  Do you have a thing for Christina?  Yeah, you're a little flushed.  She's very attractive.  She's very attractive.  Oh, thank you.  Yes, absolutely.  I have no shot with her.  That's why I'm just going to keep it.  Why don't you explain Christina?  Because it's radio, and people are dying to know what she looks like. 
[02:39:00]  So, let me get this microphone in front of my face.  Shoulder-length brown hair.  Very small.  Like about 5'4".  5'3".  5'3".  Very well built.  I'm not going to be a dick and say that she has a large boobs and a nice ass, which she does.  Thank you.  How can you see her height?  She's wearing a long...  Yeah, she's...  I hire it every day.  I hang out after the show sometimes.  That's not a very conducive with a non-sexual work environment. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  Yeah, really.  That's why I'm not saying anything else.  Human resources.  We'll colorize.  Get the whole list tape.  You're done.  I'd say a brownish color.  Brownish color.  That'd be brown, then.  Brownish color.  That would be brown.  Yeah.  What nationality are you?  Italian.  Yeah, I figured that out.  100%?  Yeah.  Mother's right off the boat.  Oh.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  That's nice.  From the town of Corleone.  Corleone.  From Bensonhurst.  Oh, really?  Ah.  So, you're a problem girl.  Yeah, she's definitely a problem.  Frank Vincent's her father screaming out the window. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  He might be listening right now, so be careful.  That's a hot one.  Dad?  Uh-oh.  She's a very sexy girl.  She's very pretty, very put together.  And blew off my advances in a second.  Of course she did.  Change the subject.  Sure she did to anything more pleasant.  I know.  Like pancreatic cancer.  I think that was a solid no.  I think that might have been a solid no.  Really?  Any chance?  Any shot?  Absolutely.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Would it?  Yeah.  Yeah, we could maybe go to dinner or something. 
[02:40:30]  Are you just saying that for radio?  No, of course not.  Go down to Bensonhurst.  Yeah, let's go to Bensonhurst.  Go to the Verrazano Bridge.  You know some gin mills there?  We could sit on the park bench.  I could tell you about how the bridge was built and how some dummy fell into cement.  Dumb fuck.  All right, cool.  Yeah.  I can't offer the same kind of date Anthony can.  Why?  I don't have the money, Anthony.  Or the class.  You just have to be careful because Bobo will try to kill you.  I know.  That's the thing. 
[02:41:00]  See, that's what I'm gunning for, really, is I want Bobo so mad at me that he actually  tries to punch me.  I'm a whore!  I want him to punch me.  I think it would be so funny to have Bobo come in and actually physically start punching  me.  You want his email password?  I thought he changed it because you guys were getting, or he changed his other password  so that you can't get his minutes all drafted out.  Is that how you got it?  Just asked him.  Well, listen, we got Dana White on the phone.  So how many times has Bobo called you? 
[02:41:30]  I don't know how many times he's called me.  You can't count that high?  Yeah, no.  But he's left me three messages.  And we got a couple of messages.  Yeah.  This is what we're getting at.  Yeah.  Bobo.  And how many times has he officially asked you out?  Well, he just asked me, at first he asked me, I guess he told you guys that we've kissed,  right?  I know that.  Yeah, yeah.  How is that?  And he said something along the lines of how he was going to go out with me that weekend  and we were going to have sex, which I found to be hysterical. 
[02:42:00]  He pretty much told you that that's what's going to happen.  Well, I think he also told people here.  He's bold.  Here's the thing about how big-hearted Christina is, that she doesn't want to take advantage  of this person, that Bobo has not asked her out more than once because Bobo said  she's my girlfriend.  And Christina said, yep, yep, I'm your girlfriend.  And just played him along.  So that's all right.  No, but he's called.  The 4th of July, he was all upset because we were going to Connecticut and he wasn't  invited.  All right.  He talked about that.  Yeah.  He called about seven times that day.  He was very upset. 
[02:42:30]  Hello.  I was just calling to see if you're back home.  I just wanted to see how you were doing, Christina.  Yeah.  Christina, it's Bobo.  Hi.  And how's Connecticut?  Give me a call when you get home.  Oh, he's so sweet.  Hello, Christina.  It's been five minutes since my last call.  I want to know if you're okay.  I'm worried.  Give me a call back.  Hello.  I just realized you probably don't have my phone number.  Here it is.  Well, at first, I gave him a studio line because I wasn't near my phone. 
[02:43:00]  And then he called Garrett looking for...  Young Garrett, yes.  We love Young Garrett.  ...advice, I guess.  Yeah.  And then he called me looking for a promotional code for his radio, which I can't help him  out with at all.  Oh, my God.  He's doing any favors and shit.  Oh, that is fantastic.  I think Garrett hooked him up with that, too.  And, yeah, that's not something that's in my control.  Can we get Bobo online?  Bobo's got a call.  Hello, Christina.  I was in the shower. 
[02:43:30]  I thought I heard the phone ring.  I guess not.  Okay, call me.  I love you.  You want to hear actual Bobo voicemails?  Yes.  All right, here's the first one.  Nothing more.  I got those...  Turns out they were just prank phone calling me.  I got that taken care of.  Got that taken care of.  Just purposely wrote something in the wrong direction.  I don't think Stan's going to be prank phone calling me.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  End of message.  He just ends it like that.  The next one's better.  Yeah, I hear the next one's better.  That's just a real quick one.  I don't even know what he was trying to say there.  He was trying to...  July 4th at 1.15 p.m. Eastern Time.  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  Just wanted to know how everything was going with you during the weekend.  Hope everything's going good.  I'll see...  If I don't hear from you during the weekend, I'll see you the next time I'm in the studio. 
[02:44:30]  Have a good weekend.  I'll see you...  I'll see you then.  See you then.  I love you.  Bye.  Oh, he slipped that in.  End of message.  See you then.  I love you.  Bye.  Oh, I can't be...  Oh, that's so sweet.  Isn't it so...  I can't be...  Oh, that's so sweet.  It breaks my heart.  Isn't that sweet?  Oh, my God.  Of course I can be part of it.  Bobo!  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here.  Hi, Bobo.  Hi, Bobo.  We got Christina in the studio. 
[02:45:00]  How's everything going?  It's going well.  How about yourself?  Let these two lovebirds talk a little bit.  You would have enjoyed it at Smithtown.  I would have enjoyed what?  No, you would have enjoyed the trip to my uncle's house.  He's got a great place.  Uncle's house in Smithtown.  That's where I wanted to take you.  Oh, okay.  You didn't tell me that.  It's a great place.  Everybody's here.  It's funny.  All my relatives are freaking hilarious.  Yeah?  Yeah, they all believe me.  My uncle Mike, he's always been an interesting character. 
[02:45:30]  Mike?  So what's going on, Bobo?  He shot a cup once in the Italian restaurant.  I'm not even quite sure what I'm doing this weekend.  Oh, really?  Well, Bobo, ask her out.  She's right here.  Jesus.  Well, I haven't made any plans.  I don't have been...  I don't even have tickets for the game.  Is that a hint?  Oh, Bobo, if I had tickets, you'd be invited.  I told you, Bobo, I'm a Yankee fan. 
[02:46:00]  We have to go to the Yankees game.  Oh, if I had tickets for that, I'd probably...  I wouldn't mind if you...  If you go with me to Michigan, I'll go with you.  I'll go with you to Yankee Stadium.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Weekend is here.  Like, make it up as you go along.  You got her here.  This is an opportunity.  Your weekend's free.  Make up a date right here on the spot and ask her.  Well, maybe if it's possible, you could go to FH Harley's with me.  Where's that, Bobo?  I don't know where that restaurant is.  I think it's, what, 400 New York Avenue? 
[02:46:30]  Thank you, man.  The heart of Huntington Village?  Yeah.  I know how to get there if I know how to get there from Huntington Station.  Oh, because you got to take the train.  So you're going to take Christina on a train to Huntington Station.  Oh, man.  Great.  Bobo, do you mind if I take Christina to a Yankee game?  That I would have to do the honors.  No, no.  Like, do you mind if you, you know, if we just go to a Yankee game?  Because I could get Yankee tickets pretty easy.  And she's a Yankee fan. 
[02:47:00]  I'm a Yankee fan.  We could drive in.  It's not like we have to take the train or anything.  And I'm just thinking, I think we'd have a good time at the Yankee game.  Would you mind if I did that?  No, I think I know where this is going.  You're trying to make moves on her.  Am I?  Yeah, I know.  Believe me.  He's smart.  Sharp as a tack, this kid.  Really.  I'm listening to the show.  I'm listening to the show, guys.  Oh.  Well, Bobo, you better step in here because Ant's moving in a little bit. 
[02:47:30]  I find her very attractive.  She is.  She's very cute.  Oh, you got to look out.  I got connections in the Bronx.  I could find out what's going on.  Now he's threatening me with mobsters, I think.  I want to hear about his connections in the Bronx.  Yeah, what's your connections in the Bronx?  Oh, I got some friends out there.  What kind of friends?  What do they do?  It's just the people I do way back. 
[02:48:00]  Are they going to harm Anthony in any way?  Yeah, what's going on?  No, no, no.  Are you threatening me?  No, they're not going to harm Anthony, but they're going to harm you.  They're going to chop my head off and put it in a freezer or something.  But they would let me know what's going on.  What?  Are they going to follow me?  Oh, they're going to...  Okay, I see.  No, no, no.  I'm saying they could probably easily probably try to get tickets and try to get a glimpse  of what's going on.  All right, Bobo.  Here's the deal. 
[02:48:30]  Ant's ready to ask her out for real.  Okay.  Now, here, it's Friday.  The weekend is upon us.  Make up a date right now and ask her.  Yeah, well, this...  How about this Saturday at F.H. Rowley's?  Well, it's really short notice.  I told you last Friday.  You can't ask on Friday to do something on Saturday.  You know what I mean?  You've got to catch me in the beginning of the week.  I'm a busy girl.  Hey, well, I could always call you in the beginning of the week.  Yes.  You could do that, yeah.  I could always do what you just said. 
[02:49:00]  I could call you in advance.  Yeah, you have to do that because, you know...  On weekends, they fill up quick sometimes.  I mean, I could call you in advance and we'll work something out.  Okay.  Sounds good.  And not only yet, one of my friends later in the season is getting me...  It might be getting me some luxury box seats at City Field.  You like that agreement?  You go with me to Met Game.  I'll go with you to Yankee Game. 
[02:49:30]  That's two dates.  Wow, that is two dates.  If I could get some tickets for the weekend.  Would you be, you know, cool?  I might consider it.  All right.  Well, no.  It's just too short a notice, guys.  I mean...  I was just hoping she would say yes and make Bobo cry.  No.  My heart.  Why do you feel bad for Bobo?  Because he's such a...  He won't even remember making this phone call.  He's like a goldfish. 
[02:50:00]  Right.  Bobo, are you okay?  Yeah, I'm okay.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Just checking.  Do you love her?  Of course I do.  Of course I do.  She's a really nice person.  Thank you, Bobo.  Well, there are a lot of really nice people, but the love thing is pretty...  Yeah, but I don't know.  There's just something that words cannot describe whatever it is about her.  Words can't describe it.  But Bobo, you should try, because she's right here.  Try to describe Christina and what she does to you. 
[02:50:30]  Well, I don't know.  She's got like this age.  She's got that Brooklyn attitude.  Like that New York attitude.  It's like a thing with me.  I got like a...  I don't know.  Like a New York fetish.  Like she...  New York fetish?  She's like...  A New York state of mind.  A New York fetish?  What is it?  I don't know.  Bobo, are you trying to say I'm a bitch?  What are you talking about?  No, no, no.  You got like the little Brooklyn accent.  I got like an accent fetish. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, an accent fetish.  And a Brooklyn accent is one of the accents I'm kind of attracted to.  All right.  Hold on two seconds, Bobo.  I'm busy here for just two seconds.  Could you throw your phone number in my iPhone?  Thanks.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, she's putting her number...  Oh, and I'm getting my picture taken.  Just pop it in there.  Well, everyone wants me to tweet you.  Yeah.  Oh.  But I mean, I got to get a good picture of you somehow.  Yeah.  You're behind the microphone.  You're on Ant's phone.  All right.  We'll wait.  Well, you're ready.  Just, you know...  Yes, Sam.  That way, see, I would call with enough time and having actually made plans to go somewhere 
[02:51:30]  and do something.  Let it be known that Christina's putting her number in Anthony's phone.  Well, you know, if something comes up...  Well, I'm going to be making plans over the weekend before you could.  Whoa!  It's a race.  Potato face.  I'm going to have next weekend booked before you do, Ant.  But Anthony may actually try to take her to a game this weekend. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  I don't think the Yankees are home this weekend.  So he'll take her to eat somewhere.  Yeah.  Oh, well, I might try to beat you to that.  I might murder her so none of us get her.  I might put her head in the bowling bag like Henry D. Lucas.  Hey, Bobo.  Oh, my God.  Have you had dreams about Christina?  You know the answer to this, Sam?  Well, it's not the dreams thing.  Troy Kwan.  Troy. 
[02:52:30]  He reminded me of something.  Wait, isn't that the club sort of Kenny's producer?  Yeah.  Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  His technical producer.  Last week when Bobo was here.  Is it a real number, Ant?  Yeah.  I would assume.  That was a real number?  I would assume she would live.  She said try now.  And then you'll have mine.  That's perfect.  Look at that.  Oh, they're exchanging numbers, Bobo.  Bobo, you should have been here.  I don't know why you're not here to stop all this craziness.  I wasn't here originally because I had a doctor's appointment that was scheduled that 
[02:53:00]  was canceled.  What kind of doctor's appointment?  We understand.  For your urinary tract infection.  Do you have a UTI, Bobo?  What doctor, Bobo?  No, it's just the doctor.  They need to see me.  I'm saying they're my allergy medicine.  My allergy medicine.  Oh, there it is.  You haven't seen me at times.  I sneeze a lot.  Give me an answer.  In middle school, you need to call me, you need to call me, you need to call me, go ahead, 
[02:53:30]  answer it.  What'd they call you?  Hello?  Hi, Christina.  How are you?  Hi, Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  Awesome.  It's great to hear from you.  It is so good to hear from you.  You know, finally talking on the phone.  Right.  Stuff, you know.  It's the first phone call.  It's a big deal.  Yeah, it is.  It is a pretty big deal.  A lot of people can get a little nervous and stuff, but at least we met in the studio.  You were really cool.  Thank you.  I think, I like, I do.  I like your attitude and everything.  You're very cute.  I think we could have a lot of fun maybe going out somewhere.  Yeah, absolutely.  Bobo, shut up.  We're on the phone. 
[02:54:00]  Bobo's just chiming in.  This is like the scene from, what the fuck was the movie with, uh.  It was horrible.  Where they're having sex and the guy ends up hanging himself in the bathroom.  Bad news bears.  No, help me out.  It's one of the greatest seats ever.  Oh my God.  All right, Christina.  Well, I'll, I'll, uh, I'll give you a call.  Bound?  All right.  Talk to you.  During the week.  Well, are you guys having a good chat?  Yeah.  All right.  Take care.  Where are you going to go?  Well. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, hi.  Jimmy's trying to call me.  I was just calling a cock block on the other line.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I'm ending your call.  Jesus, Norton.  You know, I was talking about phones.  Troy Kwan reminded me that last week.  Yeah.  After the show, we asked Bobo if he ever thought about Christina in private.  Oh.  Which then, uh, prompted Bobo to take a picture of Christina with his cell phone.  Ooh.  And then let us know that he was going to use that to masturbate.  No, uh, uh, uh, to J-O. 
[02:55:00]  To J-O.  To J-O.  Okay.  He'll be J-O-ing.  J-O.  Christina, move the microphone because everyone wants a picture of you, aunt's new girlfriend.  Give us a nice look here.  My new girl.  Jesus.  Hold on, man.  You certainly are, um.  She's not nice.  There you go.  You certainly are, uh, jumping to conclusions.  Very nice.  I, I, I need a picture now to go with.  Oh, man.  I need a picture now to go with the, the number.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the contact picture.  Are you guys going to J-O as well?  No.  Jimmy almost made it in. 
[02:55:30]  Jimmy tried to get a picture.  See, then I put it on my contact so that, you know, when you call.  Your, your picture comes up and I know, you know, hey, answer this call.  Okay.  Don't just blow it off like I do with, like, 99% of the call.  Should I say it's Bobo's girlfriend or aunt's girlfriend?  Aunt's girlfriend.  Aunt's girlfriend.  No, no.  We, you know.  Yeah.  Let's go in that direction.  I don't want to, uh, upset Bobo.  I know I'm not going to step on Bobo's toe, toe, toes.  How about this?  This is a pic of Christina, Bobo's old girlfriend, and aunt's new girlfriend. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, you can't write that.  Why?  It's, uh, no, I'm doing it.  How you doing, Bobo?  I'm doing okay.  It feels a little bit okay.  Oh, no, do you hear?  I'm, I'm doing okay.  Oh, my heart is breaking.  Oh.  I might, I might just have to challenge you to a round of, of, of Midnight Club.  Oh!  Is there going to be a duel or something?  Midnight Club.  He wants to play Midnight Club.  Nice.  On, on Xbox?  Riverwind gets her. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, he's, he's, he's just turning you off for the best gamer.  It's the remake of The Getaway, that famous scene.  Right, yeah.  With our, with our pal.  He was in that.  What the fuck is his name?  Comes in there once in a while.  Mike Madsen.  Madsen was in that.  Yeah.  There you go.  And Jennifer Tilly.  Jennifer Tilly.  Yeah, just, just, just, just a fair, just a fair, just a fair, it's a fair competition.  Riverwind gets her, no harm, no harm.  Sure.  Oh, she has no say in this there, Bobo?  Exactly.  Yeah, Bobo.  Should I stand there with the flag?  Yeah, what are you guys, gladiators? 
[02:57:00]  She's a, she's a girl, you know, she's a person.  You can stand in front of two, two guys with their video, video game controllers to, uh,  I've never been more turned on.  Two guys duking it out on the video games.  Yeah.  So sexy.  For your honor.  I'll wear a Mets hat and throw my feces at you.  I am the man who will play a video game for your honor.  I am your hero.  Yes.  I scored 1,500 on centipede.  Let me eat your ass. 
[02:57:30]  You had to take it there, didn't you?  And Bobo's just babbling.  Of course he is.  Why wouldn't he?  Why wouldn't he acknowledge?  Why wouldn't he talk?  I'll bring in a checkered flag for this.  Right, with the checkered flag.  That was worth interrupting all the big laughs from Jimmy's line.  Jesus.  Oh my God.  He's fantastic.  We'll play a game of checkers, and if I get my piece to the other side, you could king 
[02:58:00]  me with your mouth on my cock.  King me.  Oh, the visual.  King me.  King me.  You could king me with your mouth on my cock.  Oh, Bobo.  Bobo.  You still didn't really ask her out.  What's your dream day with Christina?  That's a good question.  That would be somewhere at a, I don't know, this little place I live in Woodside called  Donovan's Pub.  Oh, Donovan's Pub.  You want to get me drunk, Bobo?  Oh, man.  Well, it's a little place in a, it's a little place in a Woodside. 
[02:58:30]  I, I grew up in Woodside.  So what's a, Woodside.  What's so special about Donovan's in Woodside?  Woodside.  Well, simple.  There's one thing, beer and a burger.  Oh.  Wow.  It's easy.  That's pretty easy.  Can it be a cheeseburger?  Yeah, they do.  That's extra.  By the way, those burgers are huge.  You gotta have the stomach for it.  They're huge.  You have to have a what for it?  The stomach for it.  Oh, that's good. 
[02:59:00]  So you're telling her she's got the stomach for huge burgers?  Oh, man, Bobo, this is not looking good for you if you say things like that.  No, you gotta have the appetite for it.  Like, you gotta be hungry.  Wow, that's good.  You really know about.  Lock you in my basement for a week prior to our date.  You really know a lot about dating.  Yeah.  Girls love to just chow down on their first date.  Yeah, that's all they do is eat like pigs.  Yeah, that's what they do.  The burgers are so good, they give you toilet paper with them because you're probably going  to do shit right there at the table. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, God.  My enchanting dinner date for the evening.  It's not like they just nibble a little bit.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Way to know women, Bobo.  You gotta wait almost a year for them to fucking show their true side with their eating habits.  Yes.  I'll show her how I wipe boogers on the inside of my baseball cap rim.  There's one thing you don't know.  During dates, I don't wear my hat.  Oh.  Who, you're the bandit? 
[03:00:00]  He takes the hat off for one thing and he puts it on the antenna of the Trans Am.  Do you get dressed up or do you just keep it casual?  No, I go with the button-down shirt and the pants.  With the button-down shirt and the pants.  Jeans or khakis or slacks?  I like khakis.  Oh, okay.  Ooh, it's nice.  No sneakers.  No, I wear these shoes.  I don't know.  They're called hush puppies.  Oh, my God.  I dress like an empty nester.  He doesn't wear hush puppies. 
[03:00:30]  You know our own-  I wear geradible pants.  Hush puppies.  And I have my underoos.  You know our own dog shit-  Carl.  Oh, you're Carl.  You know our own dog shit sniffer is the bartender at Donovan's?  No way.  Oh, really?  Okay, good.  He swears he's the bartender.  He's like, drinks on me tonight.  Wow.  Wow.  One of our regulars is the bartender down there.  So he knows Bobo then.  All right.  So that sounds like a dream date.  You pig out on burgers.  I don't know.  Maybe we-  In your hush puppies. 
[03:01:00]  We could do that next week.  I could pencil in that for next week.  Pencil because-  Pencil is my chain.  I think you could tattoo it in.  Take it.  All right, Bobo.  So you can-  All right, you do a burger and a beer, but that's-  You know, then what?  You can't spend the whole night at Donovan's.  Oh, uh, I got a Queen's Motorin' Connections.  What?  What?  I got Queen's Motorin' Connections.  Queen's Motorin'?  Oh, my God.  Burgers, beer, and then the Queen's Motorin'? 
[03:01:30]  That's hilarious.  This guy is a gem.  He's got connections, though.  I got connections at the Queen's Motorin'.  Yes, there's a crack, a transsexual crack prostitute named Cookie who allows me to use  her room while she's shooting up outside.  What's up, I gotta say?  I only have to pay for ten minutes instead of an hour.  Yes.  Yeah, is this room by the hour, or are we spending the night?  Yeah, what's going on there, Bobo? 
[03:02:00]  Yes, bed bugs and quick cumming.  And do they have HBO?  Gaseous, gaseous shit burgers at the Queen's Motorin'.  We can get you an orange slice, and I can fuck you in the crack vials and the bad rug.  Go ahead, Bobo, what?  I don't even care about my uncle.  To your uncles?  Yeah, my uncles.  I don't know if I'm ready to beat the family yet, Bobo.  Yeah, Bobo, what's...  That's a big step.  That's pretty quick.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's ask Bobo, though.  What goes on at the Queen's...  Oh, fuck, I forgot.  That's just...  Jesus Christ.  His uncle in Smithtown, of course. 
[03:02:30]  Jesus Christ.  So, Bobo, what were you saying?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Talk about your connections at the Queen's Motorin', and have you been there before?  You know, I just had to drop stuff off with my uncle, who works there.  Oh, your uncle works there.  Oh, he works there.  Okay.  Oh, that's your connection.  Why would you go there, Bobo?  I'm not comfortable with that.  He's going to think I'm a whore.  Yeah, yeah, that's really not a good first impression.  But let's hear what this...  Bobo, Queen's Motorin', go.  What's that about?  What do you want to do with Christine at the Queen's Motorin'? 
[03:03:00]  You know, you know, pretty much more of that thing.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We just fucking...  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That doesn't look like an institution at all.  We just Google Earth.  The Queen's Motorin'.  Look at this thing.  Wow, wait.  Look at this horrendous Motorin'.  Yes.  Oh, man.  It's a beautiful place.  I go there a lot.  It's got a Bellevue.  It's a really beautiful place.  Wow.  Bobo, only the best for Christina.  God bless you. 
[03:03:30]  It's got a great view of the firehouse across the street.  I'm sure that wouldn't interrupt us at all.  And an auto barn's nearby.  That's good.  That's great.  Hey, Bobo, so what do you want...  Look at that.  Look at the neighborhood this is in.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Well, that neighborhood's known to a lot of people have gotten runned over.  Queen's Boulevard has a bit of history known as the Boulevard of Death.  Bobo, if a car was coming towards me on Queen's Boulevard, what would you do? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, that's good.  No, I'd actually tell you how to cross the Boulevard.  You'd actually tell me how to do what?  Cross the Boulevard.  You wouldn't throw yourself in front of the car and save me?  Anthony, would you throw yourself in front of the car?  Oh, we'd be in a car, which is a unique thing here.  Go ahead, Bobo.  Why would you let Anthony talk?  You'd go right ahead and plow straight through.  Go ahead, Juggernaut.  I would throw myself in front of the car.  Oh, you would.  I remember you said that.  Well, that would be a good ending to the date anyway. 
[03:04:30]  When that happens, please give me a call.  Yes, absolutely.  He's a comedy pothole.  Oh, he's fucking, it's amazing.  Bobo.  You're a seatless bicycle.  Right, Bobo, you're still not explaining what you want to do with Christina at the Queen's  Motor Inn in this fine neighborhood.  What do you want to do with it?  Yeah, let's get into this a little bit.  I feel nice.  I feel nice.  I feel nice.  What?  I feel like F her.  F her?  Did you say F me? 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You'd F her in what way?  In what way?  I don't know if she wants it.  Well, what's your move, Bobo?  Come on, let's get into this a little bit.  She has a little smile on her face.  I don't know if I've got a move.  Bobo likes strap-ons.  Bobo, you like strap-ons?  No, I said I've watched girls go at each other with those. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, he doesn't like men in the porno.  No.  And he can't place himself there.  We had this conversation already.  You ought to go on a double date with Jodie Foster and Travis Bickle.  Oh, this just in from Cigars and Scotch.  Good news, Bobo's able to crayon her in for next week.  Bobo, what's your move?  You're in the Queen's Motor Inn now.  What's up?  Let's go.  All right.  I bring her up to the room. 
[03:06:00]  What?  I bring her up to the room.  Okay.  Bring her up to the room.  And I guess I'd, uh, I guess I'd, uh, I guess I'd, uh, I guess I'd slowly, uh, move to the  stop.  So I guess I'd lay down on her first.  I guess I'd lay down on her first.  So while she's watching TV, maybe.  No, no, no, no, no.  I think he said something else.  What did you say?  What did you say?  Go down.  Go down on her first.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, I thought you were just, oh, okay.  Pay attention, boys.  Oh, he's a lot more classy than I had him. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, what part of, uh, her body would you spend the most attention on?  No, no, no.  I'd go pussy diving.  What?  I'd go pussy diving.  I'd go pussy diving?  So you want to go have a burger and then take her to the Queens Motor Lodge for some pussy  diving?  No, that's just any burger, Jimmy.  A huge burger.  Yeah.  With cheese.  That's where it goes in the shallow end off of a little diving board at the pool at the  Queens Motor Inn.  A big, huge burger that will get the gases going. 
[03:07:00]  And then he goes to the Queens Motor Inn and he's going to do a little pussy diving.  Some pussy diving.  Sounds like a typical first date.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  That sounds great.  I know.  He's better than I am.  I would have cut the whole burger out of the scene.  At least he's giving you food.  And the motor in.  Yeah.  Jesus, it would have been in the passenger seat of the Beamer.  Bobo, what's your, what about when the check comes?  Ah.  Ah, very good.  How do you handle that?  Do we go Dutch or is that all on you?  Oh, that would be on me. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah?  Even the tip?  Hmm.  Uh, that would depend on how much money I bring at the moment.  Now, how much, how much do you think this date would cost you?  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know.  Maybe, I think it's like an average, like a, maybe, maybe like an average, uh, $10 for,  maybe $10 to like $20 for like a burger and a beer.  Okay.  Yeah.  How much for the motor in?  Then the, the motel.  The motor in, I'm not sure yet.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm working that out with my uncle. 
[03:08:00]  How much for the chloroform in Hanky?  I'll be, I'll be, I'll be talking to my uncle about that arrangement.  Safe to say that the pussy diving will, uh, will be free?  Yeah.  I'll be talking, I'll be talking.  I'll be talking to my uncle about the, about the arrangements there.  All right.  Yeah.  I'll be, I'll be talking to my uncle there.  Is there a discount, right?  Yeah.  Is there a special room?  Get the hubba hubba discount. 
[03:08:30]  Is there a circle bed and a mirror on the ceiling?  Oh.  Well, I think, I think my uncle would know the place best because he, he, he, he's had to,  he's had to, he has had to deliver stuff to, uh, to, uh, to the, to the cleaners, people  at cleaning those rooms and he's heard stuff, he's heard stuff going on.  What are you looking at?  What are you looking at?  Oh, that's great.  Hold on.  Hold on, Bobo.  For two seconds.  Hold on.  Don't say anything. 
[03:09:00]  Uh, that is, Danny has found the Queens motor in, uh, closest motel in Queens to the Midtown  Tunnel, which is nice.  You want that as your selling point, your slug line.  And there's a coupon and special offer on the website.  It's complimentary travel kit.  Queens motor in for five day guests.  Uh, you get this, uh, savings and, uh, it says must print and present offer for savings.  And it says valid until 12 0 6. 
[03:09:30]  I don't think this website's been updated in a while.  You only have another two hours.  Yeah, I think my uncle said the guy, the guy, they got an old place, doesn't update stuff  so, so quickly.  Is he into tax?  So quickly.  It's 12 0 6.  Two and a half years.  He's very busy with taxidermy and taking care of his mother in the house upstairs.  Oh, he just keeps going. 
[03:10:00]  He plows right through.  Jesus, Bobo.  How does it...  There is some stuff my uncle would tell you about this place.  If I were able to actually somehow get him in the building, get to get him in the studio,  he'd tell you some stuff about the Queens motor in.  Oh, I bet.  I bet.  Hey, is it true that, uh, the slogan for the Queens motor in is the home of pussy diving?  It is now.  Yeah, now they'll be known as that.  Once that website gets updated sometime in 2015. 
[03:10:30]  All right, Bobo, we got the burger, we got the Queens motor in, we got the pussy diving  now.  Now what?  How does this, uh, lovely, uh, evening end?  Yeah.  What happens?  Well, does it end in the evening or does it end in the next morning?  In the morning, right, right.  Oh, he has a new one.  I love it.  This is better than the...  What?  It could end in the daytime.  Well, all right, you're done with the pussy diving, then what?  Walk us through it.  Let's get to the end of this date.  Come on.  Come on, um, um, you know, I'll, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll go, I'll start, go, go up on her 
[03:11:00]  and I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll just say she'll be, there'll be incursion going on.  What the hell is the insertion going on?  Wow.  Slick talker.  Wow.  Now, uh, uh, this is very important, Bobo.  Do you, do you practice safe sex?  Good question.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Oh, yes, you do.  How exactly?  By not showing up for the date.  That's the safe part. 
[03:11:30]  What do you practice safe?  What do you practice safe?  What is the greatest thing?  This is brand new.  Bobo.  I use rubber.  What, what is it rubber?  What would you like her to do to you?  Oh, that's fair.  That's a good question.  That's fair.  A little reciprocation.  You've been, you've been.  I can't be selfish about it.  Well, no.  Oh, okay.  Bobo, you gotta, you gotta make moves to get there.  You don't just start doing that.  So what are some moves that you would make to try to get that going on?  Oh, no. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, you shouldn't just dive right into my pussy.  That's not a good idea.  Yeah.  You might hurt her.  Yeah.  Diving.  Dog shit sniffer just.  Do a cannonball.  Dog shit sniffer from Woodside.  Of course, the bartender of Donovan's writes, fuck the Queen's Mortar and he can bang her in my face.  I've never felt so classy in my life.  It's just fantastic.  I do apologize.  I love you.  Do a night with Bobo.  Yeah, I know.  This is very romantic.  It really is amazing.  It's shaping up to be a pretty nice date. 
[03:12:30]  I'm loving this.  But Danny has a good question.  What are some of your moves to get there?  I'm not sure.  I've never done this before.  Well, you're going to have to.  Wait, would I be your first?  Yep.  That's a lot of pressure.  Bobo, you've seen movies and television.  I mean, you know, I'm sure you could probably, you know, learn and grab from some of those experiences.  So, I mean, what kind of moves would you make?  What would you try to do?  Let's just get you started.  Yeah, but you've got to get to that point. 
[03:13:00]  Let me help you out for two seconds.  You crack that door open with that wonderful key with the big plastic room number hanging on it.  And if found, please return to.  Yeah, just dropping mailbox posted guaranteed.  And you go, hey, you know, come on in.  And now you shut the door.  You're both standing in the wonderful accommodations of the Queen's Motor Inn.  Now what do you do? 
[03:13:30]  You're both just kind of standing there.  I didn't make my move on her.  I don't make out with her.  I do the old reach around.  The reach around?  What the fuck?  You're making out with her.  So, you just automatically start kissing her the second the door closes to the room.  What are you reaching around to?  No, I'd, uh, I'd, uh, I'd have first to get in the bed.  First, you say get on the bed.  Then we would fill out postcards and send them to loved ones.  No, no, I'd have.  Dear family, my travels are probably to the Queen's Motor Inn. 
[03:14:00]  Wish you were here.  I'd remember your shirt.  Why would you remove the shirt?  That's a little weird.  Oh, no, you know what I mean.  Wait, whose shirt?  My shirt or your shirt?  Yeah, whose shirt?  Oh, clearly.  Yours is coming off.  And why would you remove her shirt?  Obviously, to use the complimentary iron.  No, no, no, no, no.  This is sounding more like an abduction and rape than a date.  Bubba, why would you remove the shirt?  Why would you remove her shirt? 
[03:14:30]  I would remove mine as well.  I can't remove my stuff as well.  Now, why are you taking her shirt off?  Are you a fan of her boobies?  Yeah, of course.  It's got to make sense.  I can't.  It's a class act.  But.  All right.  Then what?  It's got to make sense.  All right.  We heard that.  We get it, Bubba.  Yeah, I'd pull over stuff and I'd go down on her. 
[03:15:00]  What's your technique like, Bubba?  Yeah.  How do you do that pussy diving thing?  Well.  It's like the triple Lindy.  I guess.  I guess.  I don't know how to describe it.  All right.  Well, try.  No, I don't know.  I guess.  I guess.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Just dive right in.  Dive right in. 
[03:15:30]  Dive right in.  That's what.  That's how you do it.  Well, you have to be careful when you're down there.  Yeah.  You do know that you're supposed to, like, just jab your tongue right in there, right?  Your stiff tongue.  Over and over again.  Violently.  I guess I guess I go lightly at first.  Oh, lightly at first.  All right.  And then gradually.  Okay.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Well, this sounds like a lot of fun, Bobo.  Yeah.  Now, should we get to the point where the date ends in? 
[03:16:00]  Well, we've gotten some pussy diving.  She's gone down.  He's practicing safe sex.  How about how long can you last for Christina?  That's the thing.  I don't know how long, but.  Well, what could you promise her?  You know, when the insertion thing starts.  What do you think?  The second you get started, how long, you think?  Yeah.  I could say I could go, if it's a half hour good. 
[03:16:30]  Half an hour?  Is half an hour good?  They charge by the half hour, so we have to get finished.  I could go an hour.  Oh.  Really?  You know, an hour.  An hour of, now, of what?  Of, of, you're talking straight sex.  Straight penetration.  Just penetration.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As you're going.  Yeah.  First time out.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know.  I'd have to bet against that, Bobo.  That's not likely, Bobo. 
[03:17:00]  First time out, I think.  You're going to be the one pump chump.  Yeah.  I think.  I think you'd be talking to your uncle in the lobby.  Right.  Okay.  I could go longer.  Longer than an hour.  Now he's up.  Now he's breaking good.  This new thing he's doing is fantastic.  Does Garrett have any info?  I see him outside there.  You have nothing?  All right.  If you don't.  That's all right.  Everyone's.  Everyone's.  He calls me every day.  He calls you every day? 
[03:17:30]  Hold on, Bobo.  What?  Ask him.  Ask him.  He's so received.  What do you got, Garrett?  He just calls me every day.  Tells me what he's up to and stuff.  Really?  He asks about Christine all the time.  Does he talk about Christine all the time?  Yeah, yeah.  What does he say?  He wants to kiss her and stuff.  Yeah.  You don't know.  He also wants to dive into my P word.  Yeah.  Really?  That's right.  Well, Bob was talking about how he's going to pussy dive.  He wants to pussy dive after he takes her to the Queen's Motor Inn. 
[03:18:00]  Well, his uncle works there.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  After an oversized burger at Donovan's and a beer, he will then take the train somehow  to the hotel.  I heard that you went to Christina now.  Well, we, you know, exchanged numbers and stuff.  Contact information.  Contact info.  Yeah, we got a little something happening here.  I think if something comes up that I think she'd enjoy, I say no problem.  Yeah.  But what about Bobo and his brother?  I thought they were together.  Well, no.  Right. 
[03:18:30]  If you guys would pay attention, you would know that his mother would like to debunk all  of that because it's not true.  Oh.  Oh, the mother wants him.  Christina knows a little bit about Bobo's personal life.  I mean, he was a little, you know.  That's good.  He had to let me know because I was a little taken aback when I heard that he was fucking  his brother.  Right.  See, Christina has a problem with that, Bobo.  Yeah, a little bit.  That would get a girl a little.  That is a truth.  Yeah.  See?  He fucked his brother.  He got fucked by his brother.  Oh, shit.  Really, Sam?  Yeah, he's not. 
[03:19:00]  Bobo is not a top.  He would be the top.  You've got to explain that.  We've got to get past that if you're going to ask Christina out for the big oversized  burger thing.  Right.  Yes.  Don't even mention any of those rumors that was going on about me.  His brother mounted and had sex with him.  Bobo, that is.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh.  Oh, Bobo.  Wow.  Everybody's really, really quiet now, Bobo.  Yeah.  That's really. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  I was going to say, I got a pencil bin for the weekend.  Ah, that's right.  Pencil bin.  Next weekend.  Now, did you ask if she is free next weekend?  Oh, are you free next weekend?  I actually, I have so much stuff to do.  I'll have to let you know.  Oh.  I will have to let you know.  Good thing that's in pencil, Bobo.  Good thing it's in pencil.  I still have time to get back to you, but let me know, because I have to look at my calendar,  you know?  I think there's a little interest there, Bobo.  She's got a pencil of her own, you know?  I do.  I have a pencil, and I have a pen.  And permaplans, right. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, it's crazy.  Oh, you got, you got, you got to let me know, because I'm, I'm, I'm going to, I'm going  to talk over the weekend.  I'm talking with my uncle about the arrangement.  Right.  For the motoring?  For the queen's motoring.  For the queen's motoring.  For the pussy diving.  I can't wait.  Where Garrett, in his words, he said, I'm going to F you.  Yeah, he goes, well, then I'm going to F you.  How long is he going to last?  Over an hour.  He already said over an hour.  Over an hour.  For his first time?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He said maybe even longer.  Wow.  Yeah.  Go Bobo.  At first it was a half an hour, but he re-nicked. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then he said an hour, and then maybe longer.  And I'm impressed.  I'm not going to lie.  Oh, who wouldn't be?  I'm impressed, yeah.  Saying you could go an hour?  That's great.  He'd also, um, he'd also jump in front of a car for me on the queen's boulevard.  Well, that's obvious.  Which is the highway of death, which is where the lovely queen's motoring is located on the  highway of death.  So when she runs out of the hotel and see her, screaming, screaming, she'll have a chance  to survive.  Right.  My battery's almost running dead.  Uh-oh. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, no.  Bobo, it was great to talk to you.  Oh, Bobo.  Aw.  You guys have a good weekend.  You too, Bobo.  All right, Bobo.  You have fun, too?  Yeah, yeah.  You still working on facial hair?  Because I remember I told you I really like that.  Oh.  Yeah, Mom.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's new.  That's totally new.  I forgot about that.  We went over to Bobo and drew a Steve C.  Sharpie.  Fu Manchu, Sharpie mustache on him.  And said, grow this in?  Yeah.  He look hot with it? 
[03:21:30]  I've never wanted anybody more.  Yeah.  Before, before, before, before the phone battery runs dead, punching out.  Oh, he needs his battery.  Oh, okay.  I do remember the drawn-on Sharpie Fu Manchu mustache so much.  It was sexy, right?  It was sexy.  And I think Bobo thought it was really working for him because I did see him out in the lobby  area still sporting it instead of washing it off at the bathroom.  He actually called me from downstairs and told me that his mustache was sweating off of  him.  And I was like, woo! 
[03:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  So.  Wow.  It was sexy.  Yeah, no shit.  Someone from Vegas, Bobo's Burgers and Boners.  Yes.  Wow.  Pussy diving.  Wait.  Someone has a song to sing to Bobo.  It's Bob in Alabama.  Bob?  Good evening.  Hey, Bob.  One night with Bobo and some beer and burgers.  Pussy diving at Queens Motor.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  That was really good. 
[03:22:30]  That's really good, Bob.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Dan.  I mean, the phone's just nuts right now.  Dan, Long Island.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Bobo sounds exactly like Jimmy Voman, a little crippled kid on South Park does comedy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we brought that up before.  Hey, I got the joke for you.  Yeah, the one that hangs around with Timmy.  The high voice Bobo is just amazing.  That's his nervous Bobo.  Nervous Bobo. 
[03:23:00]  He also, when he does that, it's really sweet.  He shakes his hands, too.  Oh, that's good.  He gets him down here, and he's like...  It's really sweet.  Right, Garrett?  I gotta see this.  Greg in Missouri has a question for Anthony.  Greg?  Greg?  I just want to know what your date with Christina is going to be.  I ain't worried about Bobo.  Oh, your date with Christina.  What?  That's real.  Like an introductory first date kind of thing?  Yeah, sure.  You know...  Well, the Yankee game is classic and perfect. 
[03:23:30]  Well, a Yankee game would be nice.  A nice early night game kind of a thing.  And then afterwards, a late dinner somewhere.  Nice restaurant, of course.  Shelby?  Yeah, I'd probably take the car out.  That's a little more comfortable than public transportation or anything.  And then if we were having a good time and you felt so inclined to come back to the house,  swim in the pool, or watch a movie in the theater, things like that, just hang out. 
[03:24:00]  And...  I am impressed, Anthony.  And there are...  But believe me, also, I'm just saying, there are separate rooms in the house if you do need  to sleep, if maybe you've tied one on or something like that.  And then pussy diving.  Of course.  There's one night that's not complete without pussy diving.  And then I'm going to F you.  Yeah, of course.  In my $20,000 bed.  Oh, God damn.  Jesus. 
[03:24:30]  Bobo's classic.  Oh, Christ.  Let me say hi to Big T.  Big T.  Yeah, what would it take for her to have a little bit of phone sex with Bobo right now?  Because he's breathing all the way.  How much money do you have?  Yeah, right?  His battery died.  His battery died.  Wouldn't you just use that cell phone until the battery died?  What's wrong with him?  What is he saving?  Bobo probably has an extra backup battery.  But what is he saving his battery for? 
[03:25:00]  This is the moment.  He's listening to the show.  He doesn't have a portable radio.  He's obviously at home.  You just plug it in.  What's more important, yeah, for him than this phone call?  That's what I'm saying.  Just plug it in.  Oh, my God.  When he calls you, does he awkwardly hang up?  Sometimes.  The first time he called, his mom was yelling at him on the other line in the background  to get off the phone.  So he's like, I'm sorry, Christina.  I have to go.  And he hung up on me.  No, usually when me, it fades out.  I'll be like, all right, I got to go, Bobo.  And then he's gone.  He doesn't say bye. 
[03:25:30]  He usually ends our conversations with I love you.  That's sweet.  That's how we have to put Garrett, too.  Yeah.  Usually.  That is sweet.  Do you reciprocate the I love you?  I say, okay, thanks, bye.  I'm not at that stage yet, Garrett.  I mean, it takes a little, you know.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  Bobo, don't forget to put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.  Sitting at that giant table in the little seats.  She would have the duckers.  Right. 
[03:26:00]  It was the duckers.  And two cokes.  I could do moving in stereo next, though.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm going to dress in a Captain Hook uniform and jerk off in the bathroom while she comes  out of the pool.  Or J-O.  Excuse me.  Or J-O-ing.  Or J-O-ing.  J-O-ing.  Jerk offing.  That's what he called it, right, Tim?  J-O-ing.  Yeah.  Tell him about J-O-ing. 
[03:26:30]  The new Bobo thing is so fucking cool.  Oh, Bobo is so nice.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  We love him.  He is fantastic.  Well, Christina, great first appearance on our show.  Oh, thank you.  And we got you out of your job.  How cool is that?  Yeah, that was awesome.  Thanks.  Let's hope that I still have a job after all this.  Now, of course.  She just did an hour with us.  Unbelievable.  You tell them to come to me.  I will.  If they've got a problem.  I will.  I'll set them straight.  Absolutely. 
[03:27:00]  You do what you want.  You ever see Goodfellas?  Yeah, of course.  You ever see what happens to what's-her-name's boss?  No.  Yeah.  What happens to the boss?  That's what'll happen to the fucking boss.  All right.  You heard it here, folks.  She does whatever she wants, your mother.  Sounds like she doesn't need your help with that.  I know.  Italian chick from Brooklyn.  Forget about it.  I know.  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  Hey, give a plug for the show you work for.  Yeah, you guys should check out Mario Chino, Angels on Call, and it's on 102, I don't know,  XM 155, Sirius 102, XM 155. 
[03:27:30]  And you guys are on in the morning?  8 to 11.  So they could listen for a couple minutes.  Yeah, I mean, we don't want our audience to abandon you because clearly-  This is the place to be.  Yeah, yeah.  But she's pretty good, though, so you should definitely-  Do we see her walking around?  No.  She's ISD, and she comes in every once in a while.  Oh, she ISD.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Sam, anything?  No.  Just I can't wait to see what the next chapter of this Bobo-Christina romance brings.  It's amazing.  It is amazing.  I can't wait either, Sam.  The Queens motor and date is so classic. 
[03:28:00]  If I was in his position, I would sell everything to try to get a nice date going and figure it  out afterwards.  Thanks, guys.  She's got to go.  Thank you very much.  Everyone's asking, is this Awesome Garrett?  Of course it's Awesome Garrett.  What other Garrett is there?  Have we connected with Awesome Garrett?  Thanks.  I'll give you a text.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Oh.  That's it.  I'm just kidding.  You got to ball up.  You got to go like this.  That was just-  He balls up his fists next to him. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  And he shakes his arms.  And he shakes his arms.  He goes, ooh.  And he kind of moves his feet because last week we kept calling him every 30 seconds from  off his phone.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah.  Last week you called me from his phone too at like nine in the morning.  You're a smart ass.  As Bobo was talking to Christina, I called from Travis's phone as he was trying to mack  his game.  And I started asking him how it was going.  So he's awkwardly trying to get me off the phone. 
[03:29:00]  They're calling me.  I don't know why they're doing this.  I don't know.  Stop it.  They can see you.  Pussy diving.  Queens motoring.  Queens motoring.  I'm going to F you.  And then we go to Queens motoring.  Oversized burgers.  You couldn't pick a better motel.  I mean, there was no-  You can't write that into a comedy where some guy like him picks a bad motel.  That's fucking-  I wanted to bring her to a Best Western, but there's no clues to me. 
[03:29:30]  I couldn't leave the light on for you.  Leave the light on.  Oh, goddamn Bobo.  Hold on.  We got the phones, man.  Everybody wants in.  He is the shit.  Joe in Dallas.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Bitter, no bitch.  You got to get Christina to fuck Bobo.  Oh, God.  The whole interview alone is going to be a radio classic.  Oh, Jesus.  I want to hear Bobo tell me how it went. 
[03:30:00]  Nothing else, man.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Yeah.  Right on.  Thanks, Joe.  Let's say hi to James in Michigan.  James?  Yeah.  You got to cop off the date with a bra burning and the fire pit out back.  Memories.  Jesus.  Footer?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, Ann.  I got the text.  Just give me the date and the time, and it's a go.  I'm dropping off the roofies.  Let me know.  That's cute for a roofie.  Yeah, you did. 
[03:30:30]  Justin in Texas.  Justin.  Hey, I just wanted to know if it makes you guys feel like real big men to stomp on the  dreams of a mentally challenged guy like that, you know?  Yeah.  It makes you feel like a big man, Ann.  Yeah, you guys are real big men, aren't you?  Hey, pussy diving's pussy diving, my friend.  I didn't know there was a Frank that's in there.  Mike in New Orleans. 
[03:31:00]  Mike.  What's up, man?  Is it just me, or does Bobo sound like Bullwinkle and Moose's retarded cousin?  Hey.  Hey, Rock.  Watch me pull a rabbit out of my head.  No, I'm doing his Bobo.  Hey, Rock.  Watch me pull a rabbit out of my head.  Hey, we're going to the Queen's boat.  I got to talk to my uncle.  Hey, I'll get you a good rate.  You don't know my own strength.  All right, guys.  Watch out.  Right on, Mike.  Fucking A.  Take room 272 next to Boris and Natasha. 
[03:31:30]  We didn't even know where that phone call was going.  That was one for the ages.  He is the best.  Bobo explaining his date.  Wayne, Louisiana.  Wayne.  Hello, boys.  Hello, Wayne.  I demand the Christina and Bobo show on Friday.  That might be a good one.  Holy shit.  You might have something there, my friend.  Can we get this done for next Friday?  That'll be great.  Her and, where are you there, Sam?  Yeah, let's try to work on that.  Yeah. 
[03:32:00]  God damn it, Wayne.  You should be our executive producer.  That would be good.  Quit your job and start driving north, my friend.  You're in.  Instead of not having one.  Yeah, we are.  Lunching out, boys.  Why don't we get all our good suggestions from the listeners?  Well, not all of them.  Some of them.  Well.  Holy shit.  Those two doing a show together.  For the record, when Danny was calling, giving Bobo, asking Bobo how it was going,  he was actually, he called up and he said,  Hey, Bobo, how's it going? 
[03:32:30]  In a whispery voice.  And Bobo said, Who is this?  And then Danny said, You getting any strange?  But then he just heard Bobo right in front of Christina just go, Strange?  Because it was like a two-part.  He goes, Am I getting any what?  And I had to go, Strange, Strange.  You getting any strange?  He goes, Strange?  Strange?  Like, where do you cover your tracks, dude?  Where do you cover it?  Steve in Canada.  Steve.  Oh, my God.  Hey, boy.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, sweet boy.  Happy birthday. 
[03:33:00]  Jimmy had to leave.  He snuck out because he's going to learn the casino business.  And I apologize to Dana White, but I think we did him a solid.  Dana White called during the middle of that.  We just couldn't interrupt what was going on.  Jimmy, really quick, he's getting on a plane to Vegas for the UFC pay-per-view this Saturday night.  And there's a viewing party.  Right.  Like the UFC, you can watch the pay-per-view at Radio City Music Hall.  Wow.  That would be cool.  That's Saturday night live.  And it's a great card. 
[03:33:30]  I mean, we've been telling you about the card, you know.  I think we'll probably be talking about it in a few minutes here.  I think we have another live room.  But Brock Lesnar and me are going at it.  That's going to be amazing.  And Jimmy will have a full report on Monday, and we'll get Dana White on the show soon.  Besides that, Steve.  You have to do a search for Ed Norton in the score, and that's with De Niro.  And he does bobo to a tee.  So do a search on YouTube.  It's unbelievable.  All right.  Ed Norton in the score?  Yep.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:34:00]  I think I saw that movie.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yes.  I saw that one, too.  Yeah.  Hold on a line there.  It's like a gimp or something.  We'll try to find it real fast.  We'll try to find it real fast.  We'll try to find it real fast.  We'll try to find it real fast.  We'll try to find it real fast.  Let Sam do it.  We'll try to find it real fast.  I get a picture of doing that.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Oh, it's in French. 
[03:34:30]  Ah, you picked a French one.  Oh, Danny.  Yeah, maybe one day I'll be able to cue the audio up in here first.  Oh, we still can't get that done?  Of course not.  It's not really important.  English, we've got to take care of the king of the internet.  So much for the king of the internet.  This is Brando and De Niro.  We need him at the beginning when he's the retard.  Yeah.  Steve, thanks for stopping the show.  I'm just kidding.  I'm a sub sign. 
[03:35:00]  We're still trying to find it.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  I'm going to keep you right there.  Oh, wait.  Wait.  Might have it?  Hey, what are you doing?  Don't let you put fingerprints on my window, Danny.  You don't let me do it.  It's okay.  It's okay.  I like a clean window, Danny.  It's all right.  You know, we missed you last night.  Are you feeling better?  Yes, thank you.  Sure.  Yes, I'm okay.  Thank you, Danny.  Keep talking.  Okay, bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God. 
[03:35:30]  It's Bobo.  Fucking Steve.  That is perfect.  Call of the day right there.  I give it to Steve in Canada.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Look at them all cocky.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mississippi Pal.  Mississippi Pal.  Hey, Gus.  Hey, buddy.  I was going to ask you guys how was Bobo going to fuck for an hour if his cell phone only  lasts 30 minutes.  I'm amazed that he thought his cell phone battery was more important than continuing the phone  call with Christina with Anthony kind of hovering. 
[03:36:00]  I don't think he's good at the all-things-considered mentality.  God damn you, man.  All right.  Well, good point.  Let me say hi to Luke.  Luke?  Yeah, that's me.  Hey, Luke.  How you doing?  Good, Luke.  Hey, just wanted to say that I appreciate you guys' radio station.  I'm a truck driver, and you guys definitely frighten my day sometimes with the comedy things that 
[03:36:30]  you guys say.  And, you know, maybe we could all learn something from Bobo.  How to wine and dine a lady for a cheap price.  Who wouldn't read a dating advice book from Bobo?  If that wasn't a book.  Oh, my God.  Greasy, oversized burgers, a beer.  A beer.  And then right to the Queen's Motor Inn for some pussy diving before I F you. 
[03:37:00]  It's going to make me laugh.  No joke.  All weekend.  That is the best.  Thanks, Luke.  Holy shit.  Oof.  Wow.  God damn it.  Just when we were ready to move on from the Bobo, man.  Oh, see?  He knows.  He fucking switched lanes.  And just, he's right back in the game.  I just can't wait to hear more.  Thank you. 
[03:37:30]  I think we're done.  Yeah.  Kenny just gave me my parking thing.  So, that means we're done.  That means we're done.  Garrett, you good?  Good.  Jay Thomas, sweet of six.  Today?  Best of today.  What was Jay saying?  I'm best of.  Oh, really?  Jay said he knew someone in the-  You got that deal, too?  No, because we fill in for the person that takes off Friday.  Oh.  Yeah.  The person that hasn't been here in a month.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus H. Christ.  But I don't blame him.  No.  It's us. 
[03:38:00]  We all want that deal.  We're not stupid.  Is it true that Jay knew someone in the L.A. coroner's office?  Someone called our show about that.  He did, yeah.  He knew someone at the morgue that saw Michael Jackson's body.  For real?  For real.  And you believe this person?  I believe Jay that said it.  We didn't talk to the person on air.  And what did Jay say about this?  That he just was super white and had no nose at all.  Wow.  No nose?  Yeah.  Like, it was, I guess, whatever taped on wasn't attached anymore or something. 
[03:38:30]  And they broke all his bones trying to revive him.  Holy shit.  Because he was so fragile.  Right.  And he was like 110 pounds or something like that.  Wow.  And what about the needle marks?  Oh, I didn't hear about that.  Okay.  Because they were starting to report that it was riddled with needle marks.  Yes.  And what, 50 pills a day or something he took?  Way more.  I think they said 10,000 pills in the last six months or something like that.  Well, he took none for five months.  And then all of them in that last month.  That would be a hell of a trip.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Look, you'd go out fast, but what a trip that would be.  Oh, my God.  Record it for your kids.  Let them enjoy it.  Hey.  I'm going to do that all fucking weekend.  You know, we should all just call Christina all weekend long.  We got a little distracted.  Let's not forget that Blanket hates the light, okay?  Let's not forget.  Blanket hates the light. 
[03:39:30]  Blanket hates the light.  We know that.  We know that, right?  Blanket hates the light.  Blanket hates the light.  Number one on Google Trends.  Number one Google Trends.  I think they yanked it, though, because they're getting pissed at us.  Oh, are they?  I think so.  Fuckers.  But let's not forget, Blanket hates the light.  Well, I saw you guys got Tippi Tom when Michael Jackson died.  That's an accomplishment.  Oh, get it.  People were wondering, yeah, who the hell is Tippi Tom?  They had an awesome article from India.  Yeah.  From India.  Who's ever read this?  Not Tippi Tom.  What did they say about him?  That was just awful. 
[03:40:00]  That he was like an AIDS-ridden fucking homeless guy.  Yeah.  And the other day, we got Corey Feldman is hurting.  Oh, God.  Corey Feldman is hurting.  Because he is, you know, and it's nothing to make fun of.  Yeah, he's still hurting.  I haven't heard from him.  Corey Feldman is hurting.  Hurting.  He dressed as Michael Jackson for the memorial.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  When you guys do that, it sounds like the end of 2001, a space odyssey. 
[03:40:30]  Hey, fucking, that movie makes more sense than Bobo.  Queens Motor.  That place is going to have a resurgence now.  A 2006 coupon to print out on the fucking website's front page.  The phones are lit, but I think we did it.  Yeah, that was, there's nowhere to really go from that one.  And I think we are officially running out of time.  We got to take a long break.  That was classic, man.  Garrett, good to see you.  You too, guys. 
[03:41:00]  Tell Jay we said hi.  Will do.  Always good to see Garrett.  She's not in studio anymore, but thanks to Christina, she was amazing.  She did great for us.  Very, very funny.  And Bobo and the rest.  And I guess that's it.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
